- Turn your toes in.
- All right.
Nod your head.
It looks like
Old Sunshine is still champ.
So far, no one has ridden him for the eight second count.
Getting a Brahma bull to leave isn't easy.
Get off the wall.
The first bull rider is Pascadera's only cowboy... and the former champion in this event...
J.R. Bonner.
And he drew for himself the current champion
Brahma bull...
Buck Roan's Old Sunshine.
And he ain't never been rode.
Hang around, old J.R.
His name's Red Terwiliger, although a lot of cowboys... are calling him money bags these days.
Red Terwiliger and his
Brahma bull called Tornado.
Best score on that ride...
75 points on a maximum score of 100.
That puts Red out in front.
...Rodeo Cowboy Association and officials... thank you very much for coming out.
We hope you've enjoyed it.
Please drive safely, walk carefully.
Maybe I ought to take up another line of work.
See you in Prescott, J.R.
Fill it up, sir?
Let me have four gallon.
Make it regular.
Hello.
Howdy.
- Howdy, mister.
- Hi.
Well, she's about two quarts low.
You want to let me have that forty weight?
Forty weight? You bet.
- I'll take some of them apples.
- We have some nice, fresh ones.
All right.
That'll be thirty cents.
Thank you.
You bet.
It's 8:45 in the Mile High City.
Robert B. Goode here.
You're in tune to KMOT radio.
The temperature stands at 78 degrees outside of the studios.
Locally, up to 40,000 visitors...
- Hi, J.R.
- Hey, how's the bull rider?
Lonesome.
Hey, give him a beer.
Not for long.
Wait till you try our brand of sunshine.
Come on, boys.
Come and get it.
A little more, Pete, a little more.
Ace!
Oh, Ace!
Sorry I missed you, Ace.
Have you seen Ace Bonner?
Who?
Ace Bonner!
Never heard of him!
It only costs $5,000, Curly.
I don't need a penny more, and I wouldn't take it... if you dropped it playing solitaire.
I can hit it, boy.
Ace, you never missed... not when it came to costing me money.
All right, so I never found much of that Nevada silver.
But, Curly, this time,
I'm talking about Australia... gold.
Dad, Australia's a long reach.
It's too long for me.
But, boy, I've already invested my last 3,000 in this project.
I don't want any part of it... not a penny of it.
I'm fed up to here with your schemes.
If you want to stick around here, that's fine with me.
I'll put you on a weekly allowance, but that'll be that.
Send his bill to me, Rose.
Well, anyway, honey,
I'm in your hands.
The nurse's best equipment... her hands and her heart.
My hand on your heart, Rose.
...but first a word from our sponsor.
Hi, folks, I'm Curly Bonner.
Have I got some news for you.
Neighbors, if you're thinking about a second home... or retirement in the clean air country... then look no further than my new mobile home development...
Iocated just east of Prescott, Arizona... the Mile High mountain area... with friendly people waiting to meet and greet you.
Now, come out and visit me at the Bonner Trading Post.
- Howdy, men.
- Howdy, Buck.
Hi, Buck.
Hey, you boys mind getting down off the fence there?
Thank you.
Hey, Claude, put this old black hookin' son of a bitch... in by himself somewhere.
- I'll get him.
- I'll get him.
Hey, watch him there.
He'll stick his tongue in you.
Get in there.
Come on, cattle!
Now, now!
Get in there!
Get in there!
What's that black little orange number?
Just a second. Eleven.
Check.
Thanks.
This is a rough way to miss a paycheck, J.R.
You'd have to be an idiot to ride one of them bulls.
Hey, Junior, you got to watch that old bull.
He's meaner than a snake.
Most fellas would like to trade him off for a hound pup... and then pay $10 to get the hound pup shot.
Well, good morning, J.R.
J.R., how are you?
- How's everything, Bill?
- Real good.
- Sure glad to see you.
- Nice to see you. Hello.
- When did you get in?
- Last night.
We got your entry. Got you down for the bronc riding... the bull dogging, the bull riding... and the wild cow milking.
You can put my dad's name down for the wild cow milking... and I'll do the mugging.
That sounds great. Good to see you and your dad together again.
Thank you.
- What did that come to, Frances?
125 out of 150.
OK, 25, plus 6, 7, 8, 9... and 30. And 20 makes 50.
We sure thank you.
Punch all those bulls in the morning about 10:00.
- I'll be there.
- Real good.
You haven't seen my dad around, have you?
No, I sure haven't.
I saw Curly yesterday, though.
I bet he'd know where he is.
Much obliged.
- We sure thank you.
- Thank you.
- See you later, now.
- All right.
Yeah, war paint.
Good morning, Red.
J.R.
You got Pontiac and Chino Valley.
Yep.
Yeah. I didn't see you around the palace.
I slept outside.
Lend me $15, Red.
You already owe me 25.
Well, that's 40.
You got change?
Well, now, I'll get it.
Hey, come around tonight, and I'll win that back from you.
Hey, yeah, why don't you stick around, J.R.?
Are you coming?
I tell you what we could do... if y'all get your car and everything...
All right.
See ya.
Big hearted, ain't he?
Yeah, Red.
Heart almost as big as yours.
Hey, York,
Buck Roan still around?
No, he went down to the palace.
Hey, J.R. Hello.
- Ben.
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.
- Welcome home, J.R.
Good to be home, Del.
Thanks.
First drink's on the house.
Well, that's a change, isn't it?
Two beers.
Dos cervezas. Yes, ma'am.
Sure been a spell, J.R.
Por mi amigo. Tome mucho.
You betcha.
Hey, you girls.
Will you go home and get your IDs?
Just go home and get legal, will you, please?
You always say that, Del.
Yeah, the sweetest things.
See you later.
J.R.
Hello, Homer, Red.
Hi, J.R.
- You want a beer?
- Don't mind if I do.
Why not? I can't dance.
Hey, Buck,
I'll be right there.
I'm not going anywhere.
You ready for another?
Just leave her on the bar.
Del.
Don't you know it?
Fine.
Have a seat. Sit down.
How you feeling?
Not bad. Not bad.
You act like you're hurting.
I'm just fine.
You contracting the Salinas show, are you... after you close out here?
Hell, I got to go on to Cheyenne... and rest my stock a little bit.
You looking forward to riding for your hometown folks?
Yeah. Me and my dad are gonna be working... the cow milking together.
Well, that's a pair to draw to.
Well, that's me and Ace, all right.
Money?
Well, money's nobody's favor, Buck... but I want to ride that
Sunshine bull of yours again.
The way your luck's running... you're just liable to draw him again.
I just don't want to be counting on my luck.
You know I don't set the draw, Junior.
Now, listen, most cowboys would pay you to stay off that bull.
I don't suppose you're thinking about paying me... to draw him for you, are you?
Well, it's just like I said... money's nobody's favor.
I'll be damned if you're not serious.
Just one of him and one of me.
Look, Junior, neither me or my bull... aim to make a living off another fella's pride.
Now, you might as well face it.
You're just not the rider you was a few years back.
I need it, Buck.
It's my hometown.
Talk to him on your time, J.R.
He's on my time now.
Right, Buck?
That's right.
You heard what the man said.
I got to go to work before somebody else gets his money.
Maybe you'll get lucky in Salinas, J.R.
Yeah.
- Hey, Red.
- Yeah.
Come on.
I'll ride that bull for half the prize money.
You sure are a man of confidence.
And mighty generous, too.
That's me, Buck... just full of confidence.
I'll give you that.
Come on, Buck.
We're all set up.
Deal the cards, boys.
Now, easy, boy.
I'm one of the good guys.
Go ahead.
He's your pa's dog, all right.
He'll either shake your hand or bite it off.
Well, let's see.
You're lookin' just fine, sugar.
Come on, now.
Here, let me have those tomatoes.
Yeah.
You farming now, are you?
Sure as hell am tryin'.
What's the old man's dog doin' here?
Waitin' on him to get out of that hospital, that's what.
Well, what's he doing there?
He ran off the Cherry Creek Road last night.
Was he drinking?
What do you think?
Totalled his truck.
Is he OK?
He's fine.
The thing is, the devil sure takes care of his own.
I went up to the ranch looking for Ace... and somebody's turned that place into a gravel pit.
- Did you know that?
- Yeah. Curly.
Ace sold out to him.
He got this notion to prospect for silver up in Tonopah.
And then he left with 15,000 in his jeans.
That's all Curly paid him for that land, is $15,000?
That's all.
Four sections up there.
I know.
Curly and Ruth still run that place up the highway?
They're the two busiest people in this county.
Curly started a mobile home development... on the ranch right in back of the trading post.
And he isn't stopping there.
Junior... where are you going to stop?
Well, about that money
I haven't been paying you...
Iooks like there's gonna continue to be... an interruption there.
Is that what it's called?
A continued interruption?
Well, don't worry about it.
It doesn't matter.
Your brother is taking care of things.
He's selling this place, is he?
Why not?
Mobile homes are the thing of the future.
Yeah.
Curly coming to supper tonight?
Yeah.
I think he wants to see you.
OK.
You and Ace.
Maybe you're the lucky ones, drifting the way you do.
Maybe.
How long you been keeping boarders, Mom?
A year.
- Where you going?
- I'm going up to the hospital.
Figures.
See you tonight.
Is he hurt bad?
I can keep him off the ceiling... but I can't keep his hands off me.
Come back in the morning.
He was asking for you.
When he wakes up, you tell him
I'm around, would you?
Folks, if you gather around...
I'd like to tell you a few words about the Reata Rancheros.
Now, the Bonner Trading Post was established in 1955.
It was ten years before the last clean air in America... was reportedly seen in Flagstaff, Arizona.
I'm no fancy scientist. I'm just a United States businessman... and I'm proud of it.
But I'll guarantee you...
Prescott's air is as clean or cleaner... than our illustrious neighbor to the north.
We have an air-conditioned chartered bus over here... to take you for a free tour of the Reata Rancheros.
And we have these lovely young ladies in hot pants... passing out free maps and brochures.
You'll find at the Reata Rancheros...
Come to the bus.
It's about ready to load.
Pick up a brochure on your way out.
Would you like a cookie before you leave?
...and total, but I mean total, electric living.
Now, I hope you enjoy the free lemonade... and cookies courtesy of
Curly Bonner's Trading Post.
Bonnie, Toby.
Excuse me, folks.
Step right this way, ladies and gentlemen... for a home on the range retirement... just ten minutes from city shopping.
Hey, Junior.
How you doin', boy?
Good to see you.
Yeah? Hey, yeah.
How's that rodeo life been treating you?
I got no complaints.
Curly, what are you doin'?
Hey, boy, I'm just making money hand over fist.
You wait until you see what I got lined up for you.
Hey, girls, let's roll 'em, huh?
You just gonna love what's happening here.
I'll see you at Mom's tonight.
7:00 dinner, sharp.
Let's go, ladies and gentlemen.
Come on!
Step aboard, folks.
Come on, now.
Everyone, let's go.
The bus is loadin'.
Here you go.
Let me help you there, ma'am.
Come on down the highway
In the twilight of your life
Come and see Reata Rancheros
Come and bring your wife
Bring the little children, too
Because when they've all grown up...
Then with the house gone, then there's no problem.
Here, things are gonna be better all the way around.
Mama's going to be living inside of model home trailers.
Well, Mom can show the people... how roomy and comfortable their lives can be on our Rancheros.
And she can be in charge of our gift shop.
That would really give her a chance... to get rid of some of these antiques.
Mom, do you have to smoke while you're feeding our baby?
Almost forgot, boys.
Here's a couple of free ones... best seats in the house.
Gee, thanks, Uncle Junior.
Now, you pass your Uncle Junior those mashed potatoes and gravy.
You get some good draws for tomorrow, Uncle Junior?
You better believe.
You could ride anything with hair on it, Uncle Junior.
Well, you pays your money, you takes your chances.
Pass the whiskey.
There never was a horse that couldn't be rode... there never was a cowboy that couldn't be throwed.
Famous old saying, all right.
Well, Curly says that you've seen one rodeo... you've seen 'em all.
Well, I didn't mean our rodeo, darling.
That's a part of history.
Well, still, it's just a rodeo.
So, you went to see him?
Yeah.
How much was it that you paid for the old man's land?
15,000. Yeah, which he proceeded to gamble... and throw away in Nevada.
But he had to quit prospecting... twenty feet away from mother lode, just like always.
It don't seem much.
2,600 acres.
Well, now he's got this scheme to go to Australia.
Well, why don't you send him?
Come on, Junior. I put him on a weekly allowance... and that's that, and I told him so.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Why don't you start thinkin'... about your own self for a change?
You may not know it... but you are in the right place at the right time. It's here.
It's a regular land boom, Junior.
Yeah, I saw your wide open spaces.
You know less about wide open spaces than I do.
I know it here... where it is.
You're just some kind of motel cowboy.
15,000 just seems a little bit short.
15 or 30,000, he still would've blown it all.
Now, he needed the money fast, and I got it for him. Me.
I just want you to get a grip on your future.
I want you to come work for me.
You want me to help you sell the old man's land?
Our land.
Junior...
What a salesman you'd make for the Rancheros.
Big cowboy like you... sincere... and you're genuine as a sunrise.
Well, there's no point in foolin' ourselves... now, is there?
You got to ride.
Giddyap, giddyap. Got to ride.
That's right, Curly.
Salinas, California.
Day after tomorrow.
Will you think on what I said?
I just don't want you turnin' out like the old man...
Curly! Curly, what's happened?!
My God, you've killed him!
Damn, what a lickin'.
Junior...
Don't say it. I'm goin'.
And I'll send somebody over tomorrow to fix that window.
And you take his damn dog with you!
You just can't walk out of here.
You just can't walk out of here.
You see my feet on the floor, don't you, Arlis?
Now watch my legs make 'em move.
But you're not well enough!
I'm heaven-bound, sweetheart, but not today.
Get that cleaned up, will you, please?
Junior was in yesterday, and he said he was coming back.
Well, he'll find me, or I'll find him.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Ace, you get back in this room.
I'll use force if I have to.
You're not leaving this hospital... no matter what.
Orderly!
Orderly, stop this man!
Stop him!
I don't fight fair, boys!
And you are a fool,
Ace Bonner!
Adios, sweet angel of mercy.
Where to?
To the rodeo, partner.
Where the hell else?
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.
Well, do I get that draw, or don't I?
I been thinkin' on it, Junior.
Kick in the head, Junior.
That's what it's about.
You know, Junior, if a man was going to expand his business...
I'm talkin' more shows and more towns... he might be interested in an assistant.
Say, a fella that'd been around some.
A champion in his day.
Well, I just thought
I'd mention it.
Don't think so, Buck.
You had breakfast?
Nope.
How about we go down here and get a little bread and gravy?
That'll be fine right there.
Keep the change, son.
Hey, dog. Where you been?
Stay here, boy.
Hey, you pretty little girls... you look like you might've seen Junior Bonner.
No, but I'd be glad to give him any message... anytime.
Now, how'd I know you was gonna say that?
Who do you suppose he is?
All those contestants planning to ride in the parade... please assemble at the south parking lot.
Come on, come on.
Let's get on the float, OK?
Ace Bonner slept here.
He said he'd find you.
Here you go.
I'll make sure he takes his medicine.
Hi, Ace.
Hey, Roy.
Are you still livin'?
Still around and kickin'.
How you been makin' it?
Better than I deserve.
Goin' down to get in the big parade?
Don't you know it?
How many we rode in, Roy?
Not enough, Ace.
Not enough and maybe too many, huh?
Too many, probably.
I wonder if I can hold him off that first narrow.
I think I got company.
Hey, pretty little girls...
I want you to meet
Mr. Ace Bonner.
- How do you do, Mr. Bonner?
- Howdy.
No. That's me.
You J.R.'s dad?
I used to be. Didn't I, Roy?
That's right.
Come on, let me show you the way into town.
Afraid we'll get lost?
No, I'm afraid
I'm gonna lose you.
- So long, Roy.
- So long, Ace.
No way, not me.
Hey. Johnny Muller.
Where's my horse?
Ace Bonner.
Ace?
You fellas just sit around and let him take it?
Yeah.
Have we got all our bull riders here?
Have we got all our bull riders here?
'Cause I'm closin' the books.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
OK, well, here's what we got today for you boys.
OK, Jones... number 46...
Spike.
Tom Acuff. Number 16, Tom...
Tojo.
OK, Jimmy Morgan... number 86... Buttermilk.
Terwiliger,
Red Terwiliger... number 35...

Thunderbolt?
It's all right, Red.
You'll make him look good.
Just watch it, J.R., if you got time.
I got the time.
Bonner... draws number 62,
Sunshine.
That's Sunshine twice in one week, J.R.
I'll buy you some more tape.
- All right, Red.
- Where you goin'?
I gotta go find my dad.
He stole my horse.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Prescott, Arizona... and the 84th annual
Frontier Days celebration... and the national
Fourth of July parade.
The grand marshal in this Frontier Days parade...
Mr. Casey Tibbs.
How you doing, Casey?
Welcome to Prescott.
There's Ace Bonner.
Hi, Ace! Where you been?
Hey, Ace!
If you're still on your feet... remember, that first dance is mine!
I'll do 'er.
Howdy, folks.
Get your hot dogs, your hard candy right here... compliments of yours truly,
Curly Bonner... from the Reata Rancheros!
Get your hot dogs, kids!
Get your hard candy!
That's what it's for!
Prescott's junior high school band.
Seen the old man?
Yeah, he's up ahead between the Indians and the flag.
I'm gonna whip your ass, Junior.
Well, somebody is.
It ain't gonna be the first time.
Hi, Bonnie.
Howdy, J.R.
- How you doin'?
- Fine.
Hello, Ruth.
J.R.
You always did love a parade, Ellie.
You always did sit a good horse, Ace.
Where'd you steal it?
We'd certainly like to thank... the Air Force band for being with us today.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Hello, cowboy.
I like your horse, Ace.
So do I.
Climb aboard.
Are you sober?
I'm as sober as the day you met me.
I've been tryin' to find you all day.
I was lookin' for you.
You stole my horse, Ace.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Yavapai County's own Ace Bonner!
And, riding with Ace Bonner, his boy J.R. Bonner... twice Frontier Days champion bull rider!
Let's hear it!
I got a bottle, Ace.
You want a drink?
Watch them drunken idiots!
That's Junior's old man!
Watch out!
Don't run over 'em!
And here's Curly of Reata Rancheros!
How you doin', Curly?
Ace!
Ace!
Hey, hold on!
What's the matter, son, don't you like us?
All right, Ace, let me up in the saddle, damn it.
Come on, you get up here where you belong!
- No, you ride in the back.
- Mind your dad!
Yeah!
Easy!
Great.
Come on, get up here, cowboy.
Get that damn horse outta my yard!
I'm really sorry, ma'am.
For Christ's sake.
We're goin'.
You're gonna get us killed, Ace.
Yeah.
- I gotta sit down.
- You and me.
Well, you fall off better than I do.
Yeah.
That's the best ride
I've had... since Christmas Eve in Tonopah... and I was snowed in.
Bobbie's?
Me and the buckeye.
She sends her regards.
Oh, yeah.
You ever hear from Johnny Mars?
Yeah. He's bustin' horses out of Carlsbad.
Still makes the El Paso show.
And Buddy Cox... always hollered,
"As long as women live...
"my name will never die."
Well, he's dead, Dad.
Car crashed between
Abilene and Dallas.
Well, I hear you're doin' very well.
Where'd you hear that?
Takin' care of Mom, are you?
Not much.
She's sellin' antiques out the townhouse.
She's happy.
She's livin' right where she wanted to live all her life... right in the middle of things.
Curly's gonna sell that house.
Put her in a curio shop.
Curly's doin' right well.
Junior...
I'm goin' to Australia.
What are you gonna do, hunt kangaroos?
Gold for the findin', that's what.
150,000 square miles to prospect.
And sheep. Marino.
Finest wool in the world.
I already made the down payment.
How would you like to come down there with me?
Hell, I know you can't make it.
Not a big rodeo star.
But at least you could grubstake your dad.
I'd make you partner number one, Junior.
Partner number one.
What do you say to that?
There's somethin'
I gotta tell you.
No, somethin'
I gotta tell you... about mining.
There's a lot to learn.
Rare metals... big future.
I'm busted, Ace.
Of course, you never tried your hand at prosp...
Busted?
Flatter than a tire.
Well, all I need is 5,000.
Heh. How about five million?
Well, it's time to go to work.
If you're not too old to rope.
I'll do the muggin'.
Got us entered.
- Wild cow milkin'?
- You bet.
Come on.
Curly paid you the money for the land, Pop.
What'd you do with it?
The honest intentions of a man... trying to make money with money.
The unfortunate prey... to the evils of nighttime ladies and neon lights.
But, no, sir, no matter what he says... not penny one from Curly will I take.
And I mean that.
Because...
Ace, one more parade.
Come ride in the grand entry with us.
Can I steal your horse again, Junior?
What's mine is yours.
Busted?
Opportunity of a lifetime.
Come on, girls.
All bronc riders report...
Acuff, Terwiliger,
Carson, and Bonner.
Damn it.
Well, if it isn't
Junior Bonner.
Hey, folks, this is Junior Bonner.
Burt Hunsacker.
You remember me.
Six years ago, a little place in Nogales.
Right after the Tuscon show?
Six years is a long time.
But you're sure lookin' good, Burt.
Here's your grand entry... for this, the 84th annual
Frontier Days Rodeo... the oldest professional rodeo in America.
It was on July 4th, 1888... that cowboys from the surrounding ranches... first gave as an entertainment to the people of Prescott... an exhibition of ranch activities... and cowboy sports...
Hi, J.R.
The Prescott Frontier Days celebration... is the original cowboy rodeo in America... and in the years since, it has continued to be... one of the most honored and well-known rodeos in America.
Hey, Bill, let me have that rope, will ya?
I should mention here that if any of you... were at the big parade downtown earlier this morning... and are wondering if that fella in the blue shirt... on the Roan horse is gonna compete today...
I can tell you he will.
Ace Bonner will be a contestant in today's rodeo.
He's been a part of the rodeo for 42 years.
Now here's the grand marshal of this year's rodeo... twice world champion, all-around-cowboy Casey Tibbs.
Our rodeo stud contractor... the man responsible for all the bucking horses... steers, and bulls you're about to see...
Buck Roan.
Buck Roan of Amarillo, Texas.
And here's a pair of fellas... who'll be entertaining you this afternoon...
Tom Lucia... and joining Tom... the clown bull fighter from Enid, Oklahoma...
Jim Hill.
All right, Tom. Hold it.
Better save that for the Palace bar.
All right. There's $5,000 total prize money... waiting on these cowboys today... so let's get to the first event... saddle bronc riding.
Number three, J.R. Bonner... on a bronc named...
Hold it, J.R.
Don't start your ride till the gate's open.
Get down on it easy, J.R.
Don't make no noise on that gate.
Don't make no noise on that gate.
Don't ask for it. Just...
Put him out, J.R.!
That a boy!
Rake him, rake him! That a boy!
A good ride and a good try, J. R... but a little short.
Let's have a hand for J.R. Bonner.
You know somethin', Ace?
Old Junior's gonna spoil all my horses... if he don't quit blindfoldin' 'em with his ass.
Can't win it that way, J.R.
No, you can't win 'em all, partner.
Good ride. The score for Bobby Fenly was 62.
Steer Wrestling.
Here's an event that requires perfect timing... on a straight run.
Bulldogger jumps from his horse... grabs the steer by the horns... stops him, and puts him down.
That's that.
And as far as I know... the steer is still runnin'.
$850 total first prize money.
J.R. Bonner...
Red Terwiliger doing the hazing.
Steer number 42.
You're up, J.R.
- Ready, J.R.?
- Yep.
You're up.
All right. The boys are ready.
Good time for J.R.
A mighty fast time.
The best so far today...
8 and 2/10 seconds.
8.2 for J.R. Bonner.
Now the boys will switch around... with J.R. Doing the hazing for Red Terwiliger.
You gonna beat
J.R.'s time, Red?
Steer 38!
Red Terwiliger!
He did it.
Time for Red Terwiliger...
6 and 5/10 seconds.
Tough luck, cowboy.
It happens all the time, dude.
I'll tell you what... if you were to take a cattle stampede... and cross it with a barroom brawl... you just might come up with something... resembling our next event... wild cow milking...
Now, don't you wait for my loop to settle, Junior.
I'm accurate number one, so the minute I throw... you get your tail in motion, boy.
And then I'll do my thing, as they say.
Before we turn loose those boys... we got penned in that circle over there...
They're the muggers, and it's the muggers's job... to hang on and slow down the cow... while the roper gets down from his horse... and handles the milking chores.
You muggers and ropers remember whose team it is, won't you?
All right, turn the cows loose.
Here they come.
Rope 'em down.
Over here, Junior!
Here's your place.
Over here, Ace!
Come on, Ace!
That dog bit me again!
Get that dog outta here!
Not our cow, you knothead!
Damn it.
Get that yellow son of a bitch outta here.
Come on, Ace!
Hang on to her, Junior.
I gotta fill it up again!
Gimme another shot at it.
- Come on, Ace!
- All right. One more second.
OK!
Hey! Hey, look out!
- Give me the bottle!
- No, no, no, I got it!
Come on, gimme that bottle!
Gimme the bottle!
I got it!
The winning team is
Rudy Martinez and Ray Poole.
Will somebody get that damn dog?
We could've won.
We did, Ace.
How about a special hand now... for the oldest contestant?
Ace Bonner...
Sixty years young and still going strong.
And will somebody get that dog the hell out of here?
That concludes the first half of our performance.
We're going to take a break now.
See you all back here at 3:30 for the concluding events... in our Fourth of July
Frontier Days Rodeo.
So, what happened to her?
Just one of those things you grin at and drink to.
Into the mouth and over the gums...
Iook out, stomach, here she comes.
Lord, but that does heal the aches of a loser.
If this world's all about winners... what's for the losers?
Well, somebody's gotta hold the horses, Ace.
You're right.
See you fellas later.
Now, you're gonna be there... when I deal with that bull of yours, ain't you, Buck?
Yeah, Junior, I'll be there.
Well, don't look at me, boy.
I don't make no decisions with a drink in my hand.
Then you'd better put that drink down...
'cause you've got company, Ace.
He's in the navy now, Elvira.
Just home on leave.
That's fine, just fine.
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
I'm in trouble, son.
Take a deep seat, Ace.
If this is any of your idea...
I'll blister your tail from here to next Wednesday.
You're not nervous, are you, Ace?
Hi, Junior!
Hi, Grandpa!
How've you been?
Come on up here. You, too.
Golly, I missed you.
Did you kill any lions?
Did you find any silver?
Hello, Ace.
Mrs. Bonner.
Lookin' very well.
You don't look so bad yourself, considerin'.
Dad, could we have a drink, please? We're thirsty.
Yeah, please, Dad.
We're awful thirsty.
Why, sure you can.
We'll all have ourselves a drink.
- Del?
- Yes, sir.
Beers all around for these midgets.
Ace, Cokes.
- A round for me and my boys.
- Comin' up.
- Ruth?
- No. Beer is fine.
Ellie, I seem to recall... you had an occasional taste for bourbon whiskey.
Didn't think you'd remember.
Who could forget?
It was a nice float you had, Curly.
Finished second in the commercial division.
Well, second's better than third.
Ellie.
Thanks.
This calls for a toast.
We are all together.
You're up, Ace.
Well, since I am top of the pile... to them as has their roads ahead.
Ace?
Our dance.
Arlis.
Well, you all know Arlis here.
I've heard the name.
Hello, Mrs. Bonner.
Our dance, Ace.
Didn't you always save the first dance for Mom, Ace?
It's a good idea, Ace.
Boys, times have changed.
I changed them.
Dance with her, Ace.
Sweet combination.
I can't dance with both of you.
Come on, sweetheart, let's cut it together.
Curly.
Come on, kids.
You want a beer, Curly?
Just like old times.
Now would you like a beer?
Junior, you're my brother... and I guess I love you.
Well, we're family.
I don't care what you do.
You can sell one lot or a hundred lots.
I'm just tryin' to keep us together.
I gotta go down my own road.
What road?
I'm workin' on my first million... and you're still workin' on eight seconds.
Curly?
Come on.
Come on, let's dance.
Here's a little song I wrote for all the rodeo hands.
It's called "Rodeo Man."
I'll be in town this weekend, honey
Look for me downtown
Anytime after the band starts playin'
I'll be around
I'll park my two-horse trailer
Up at the rodeo grounds
Then I'll start roarin'
I'm the rodeo man
I picked up 35 bucks in Reno
Couldn't get a decent ride
But I'll do all right in the Frontier Days
Unless all the good bulls die
I was raised in the town of Prescott
I got my home folks on my side
I'm gonna win top money
I'm a rodeo man
Gonna enter in the broncs and the ropin'
On Saturday afternoon
And the bull ridin' in the night show
While the band plays a cowboy tune
And if I could just draw me a mean one
Then stick on it just like glue...
Champagne.
And three double bourbons.
I'm a rodeo man
When my last ride's over
And my ribs are all taped down
I'll pick up my top money buckle
And, honey, we'll head for town...
Dance with me?
You do dance, don't you?
You're a little out of line, Junior.
Not really.
I'll dance with him.
Yeah!
Hey, how about playin' somethin' a little bit slower?
One dance, Junior.
I can't count much further.
Today I
Started lovin' you
Again
And I'm right back
Where I really ought to be...
Hey, J.R., where'd you get the new doll?
What you doin', Casey?
That's a young filly
I picked up down in Cheyenne.
Just long enough
To let my heartache mend
Then today
I started loving you
Again
I got over you...
Hey, you mind if I cut in J.R.?
Well, I'll tell you the truth, Red.
I kinda do.
Nothin' personal.
Well, I hope she treats you better than Sunshine.
So do I, Red.
Who's the Sunshine in your life?
Just the bull I'll be ridin'.
Thank you, J.R.
Hi, sweetheart.
Anybody ever tell you...
- You get.
- What?
Come on, I mean it.
Red's at it again!
Hold it! Hold it down!
You fight like my old lady, Red!
We can't have no fightin' around here.
Come on, Terwiliger!
Watch him, Buck!
- What's your name?
- Charmagne.
Why do they call you Junior?
Well, I tell you the truth,
I don't know.
- It got stuck, huh?
- Yeah.
Oh, no!
You from Phoenix?
Curly Bonner smacks the gringos!
You work down here, do you?
In the bank.
It's not very exciting compared to what you do, is it?
Well, not unless you own the bank.
Misdeal.
My old lady's over there, you know that?
Hey, sweet cheeks!
Come on, let's get out of here!
Go on. Get the kids!
I watched you today.
You were pretty good.
I fall off a lot, don't I?
Keep clear, boys.
My dog don't fight fair.
Do you always run with that crowd?
No. Anyway, it looks like this crowd may not make it.
No, I don't think so.
Eat it! Eat!
You got a girl?
Why?
Why not?
I'm just passing through.
Where to?
I'm goin' up to Salinas,
El Paso, down to Fort Worth.
Just like old times.
Driving cowboy.
Stop it! Stop it!
Better hold up there!
I think it's time to play something patriotic fellas.
Yeah, hold it, hold it.
Let's do
"The Star Spangled Banner".
Stop! No! OK? Stop!
Hey, Curtiss, let's have a drink, huh?
The fightin' excitement's all over with.
Here we go.
- Thank you.
- You betcha.
Think I'm feeling a little better... now I'm drinking this beer.
Yeah? What are you chasin' all the girls for?
I love 'em.
No, no, Del, it wasn't no bronc, but a bull.
Name of Holy Joe.
You remember him, Roy?
Yeah, I remember him.
Old Holy Joe... blind in one eye... meaner than a boot full of barbed wire.
He sent a lot of good hands to church.
Made more than one cowboy do a little praying.
Well, sir, I wanted to draw on that bull the whole year.
And don't you know... when we got to the Madison Square Garden... by God, I got him.
I told Mr. Jack Dempsey... in this restaurant the night before... we was introduced as one champ to another...
I told him if he wanted to see a real fight... he ought to see me and that bull go eight seconds.
Well, I rode that bull... and after eight seconds... there were
16,423 big city dudes... standing on their feet and hollering my name.
That was the last time, though.
Ellie? Excuse me, boys.
Ellie, where you going?
Did you hear me, Ellie?
I asked you where you were going.
To get some air.
Now, wait on me, honey.
I want to talk with you.
By hook or by crook,
I'm going to Australia.
Well, you always were good at putting distance between us.
Now, look, honey... don't turn your back on me.
I'm askin', what's a man to do?
Silver all shot to hell, no more bounty on the lions.
Hey, you know, you could go down there with me.
Ace, why don't you just shut up?
She's sure got a case of the knits, don't she?
Australia.
Silver in Nevada.
You are a broken record, Ace.
Now, quiet down, honey.
We don't want our wash hung out in public.
Why the hell should I be quiet?
- Now, listen, honey...
- You listen...
'cause I just don't give a damn anymore.
As far as I'm concerned... you can go to hell or Australia, but not with me.
Well, they're both down under.
Dreams, sweet talk... that's all you are.
If you stay with me...
I'll sweeten the dreams, too.
Remember?
Well, sure as hell,
I had that coming.
You sure as hell did.
But I'm leaving for good, Ellie... and I mean it this time.
Then all we got left is today.
Well, anyway, Ellie... you seen one rodeo, you seen 'em all.
Yeah. Sure.
The time for Billy Longer and C.T. Jones...
16 and 4/10 seconds.
Our next ropers... a pair of Casa Grande,
Arizona cowboys...
Jim Carter and Paul Arnold, looking to beat 16.4.
Bring the bulls on!
The winning time so far,
15 and 3/10 seconds.
15.3 for Jim Carter and Paul Arnold.
Get him in there!
Next up, Bob Malone of Mayer, Arizona... and Al Gardner of Dewey, Arizona.
Let's go, J.R.
Our final pair of ropers in team tying...
Henry Thompson of Florence, Arizona...
B.W. White of Phoenix.
Well, you couldn't make it much closer.
15 and 4/10 seconds.
Better pull your hat down today, pard.
We'll move along to the final event on today's program... bull riding, the most dangerous event in rodeo.
In order to qualify for prize money... the cowboy must stay aboard a twisting half-ton of fury... for eight seconds.
You know, successful or thrown in his ride... the safety of our bull riders today... may well depend on the daring of our rodeo clowns.
Scoring in this event is similar... to saddle and bareback bronc riding.
Our 2 judges can score up to 25 points... on the performance of the bull and the cowboy.
First place money, $950.
OK, the boys in the chutes say they're ready to go.
Hold on, J.R.!
Well, that's the luck of the draw, Bob.
Speaking of luck, it's J.R. Bonner's luck... to have drawn the country's number one bucking bull... undefeated in 29 rides... the 29th of which was, you guessed it, J.R. Bonner.
Four days later, right here in his hometown of Prescott... this former bull riding champion... is now back to try Buck Roan's...
Old J.R. Bonner on Old Sunshine.
Come on!
How about that ride, folks?
J.R. Has done it.
He's the first man ever to ride Old Sunshine... and a dandy ride it was.
Well, our rodeo judges scored 92 points on that ride...
92 points for J.R. Bonner.
That's going to make him about $950 richer.
Folks, that's the last ride of the day.
- That was a hell of a ride, J.R.
- Well, it's about time.
This was some way to end... the 84th annual
Frontier Days Rodeo.
I think you'll agree with me that after 84 years... they still make cowboys as tough as they ever did.
We'd like to thank the Prescott...
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Chaparral airlines flight 417 for Phoenix and Tucson... is now boarding.
Passengers holding tickets may board through gate number five.
Passengers holding space... on the continuation of flight 417... please have your tickets ready at the gate.
Rodeo time.
I got to get it on down the road.
So long.
Ma?
Ma?
Junior.
You had to win, didn't you?
Yeah.
So long, Mom.
Hey, Junior! Junior!
Hey, Junior!
Don't you hear me, boy?
I'm sure you're going to enjoy yourself. Thank you.
Good morning.
I'd like a one-way ticket to Sydney, Australia... a man and a dog.
All right.
Economy will cost you $585... and first class is $798... plus $40 for the animal.
- Write it first class.
- All right.
Put that in the name of Mr. Ace Bonner.
And you can have it delivered to him at the Palace bar.
All right.
Here's your money.
Who shall we say paid for the ticket?
Tell 'em Junior sent you.
Thought I told you not to run them sheep on my land!
It's my land, Garrett.
It became mine when we signed that lease.
He's right, Mr. Garrett.
I'm paying you off when we get back, and I'm breaking that damn lease.
- I don't allow the law'd agree to that.
- What law is that?
Santa Fe Ring law?
Shit.
- Goddamn law is ruining the country.
- Ain't you still a part of that law?
Something wrong with that harness.
I believe they elected you and paid you good wages for killing the Kid, huh?
You rotten son of a bitch.
- You try your luck, Eno.
- You miss more than anybody else does.
I'll bet on it.
Want the breast or the thigh?
What he always gets.
I want a breast and a thigh.
Jesus Christ!
- Who is it?
- Get down!
Goddamn, that's Garrett.
Hello, Bill.
- It's fair shooting for an old married man.
- Lucky, I guess. How are you, Kid?
- Good to see you.
- Good seeing you.
- Hey, Billy!
- Who's this you got with you?
- Looking good.
- Having some kind of fiesta? Hello, Black.
We always live like this.
You ought to visit us more often.
I reckon the whole damn territory's gonna be one big open jug for us now.
- Is that right, Pat?
- Ain't that right, Pat?
Take a two-day ride from Lincoln just to pay me back the $2 you owe me, Pat?
You'd better collect it now, Black.
We ain't gonna be seeing much of Pat these days.
Say, I understand those Mexican señoritas are still pretty as ever down there.
Yeah?
I know one's waiting on you, hoss, with a knife.
- Remember them sisters?
- No. Which ones were they?
That one you got up and asked how much you owed.
And she said,
"Whatever you think it's worth."
You threw a dime on her pillow.
Girl said, "If that's all it's worth,
I might as well sew it up."
Son of a bitch.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
You don't figure he's too good to drink with us, do you?
Maybe it's the other way around.
Jesus, don't you get stale around here, Bill?
Maybe a year or so down in Mexico will do you some good.
I didn't figure you'd bother to make a ride out here.
Shit, you know me better than that.
You heard about Eben?
He drowned in the Rio Grande.
Trying to get to that old Mex you're talking about.
He took two of the posse with him.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I always liked old Eben.
At least he knew when it was the right time to leave.
We did have some times, didn't we?
It's gotta be pretty hard to turn your back on all that.
You want it straight?
If that's what you're here for.
The electorate...
...wants you gone.
Out of the country.
But are they telling me, or are they asking me?
I'm asking you.
But in five days, I'm making you.
Because I might take over sheriff of Lincoln County.
Old Pat.
Sheriff Pat Garrett.
Sold out to the Santa Fe Ring.
How does it feel?
It...
...feels like times have changed.
Times maybe.
Not me.
Hey, why don't you stick around.
We got a few days left, ain't we?
No, I gotta get back.
Adiós, Pat.
Adiós, Bill.
Don't press your luck.
I ain't worried about my luck.
Why don't you kill him.
Why?
He's my friend.
Get on up, Billy.
You hear what I'm saying?
I ain't making no money watching you boys sleep.
You like to waste the best part of the damn day.
Let that squirrel loose!
You'll shake it to death.
- I'm just scratching.
- Chisum's cattle is waiting.
Oh, let them wait.
I hate a son of a bitch that gets up noisy and full of himself.
I ain't in this for my health, hateful.
That's awful.
- Pat ain't gonna like this.
- What?
Coming down hard on him the day after he got his new badge.
Hell, there ain't no way he's gonna know.
I ain't afraid of Pat Garrett.
Well, all right, a little bit.
Bastards.
I'd best go get them horses watered.
Goddamn Chisum.
How'd he know we was here?
- Hell, that's Garrett.
- Goddamn him too.
Now he's got Bell and half the town of Lincoln out there with him.
Help me up.
Sweet Mary's ass!
Don't let me go down.
They killed me. I'm gut-shot for sure.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold it!
Bill!
Come out!
You don't have a chance!
What are you taking me in for?
Which one was that?
Buckshot Roberts.
For the killing of Buckshot Roberts!
Hell, that was a year ago.
I shot him straight up.
Come on in, Pat!
I'll warm your breakfast!
Guess he ate.
They're closing down the store on us for sure.
Maybe it's time you took a walk.
Hell, yes.
Why not?
I can still hold a gun.
We gotta move. I'm going fast.
Kid.
Sweet Mary's ass!
I'm going now, so, by God, let's get on with it.
Hey.
I ain't afraid of him now.
Hold your fire! We're coming out!
Hold it!
- You go left. I'll go right.
- Might be they ain't circled us.
Might be the dog would've caught the rabbit if he hadn't thought to shit.
Where are the goddamn horses?
- That's enough!
- Hold it! Hold it!
All right, Kid!
Come on out if you're still alive!
Game's over!
Coming out, Pat!
You're in poor company, Pat.
Yeah, I'm alive, though.
So am I.
I never figured to hear you brag on being a working man.
Well, I never figured you for the law either.
It's just a way of staying alive.
No matter what side you're on, you're always right.
And I aim to live to be rich, old and gray.
That's a fine ambition, Pat.
You keep thinking like that.
I'll think on how I'll spend your money.
Only thing you've got to think about...
...is when you stand before the highest court there is.
May it sit in judgment on your rotten soul.
Now, you listen. Listen to me good.
Before that rope snaps, it'll hit you like a bolt of lightning...
...that what I've been telling you is the truth!
You'll learn to believe before I'm finished.
That's 3 to you.
What do you believe in, Bell?
I do believe I'm gonna have to see that bet...
...and raise you 5.
- Billy...
...somewhere in the Good Book, it says there's a time for everything.
A time to love, a time to hate...
...a time to kill.
But now it's time you got close to God, boy.
I heard God's fast...
...but I have to go up in front of him myself before I'd bet on it.
You will.
Well, that puts me on my way.
I got to go collect a few more taxes.
He's all yours. Two days, boys.
I count eight days till dawn, Billy.
You'd best be on your knees and making the acquaintance of your Lord and master.
Pat, keep that mule's asshole away from me before I have to break him.
I surely wish you'd try, son.
I got my shotgun full of 16 thin dimes.
Enough to spread you out like a crazy woman's quilt.
- Bob.
- Why don't you sing a song of Jesus...
...while there's still a way.
- Bob. Bob.
Damn it.
Mess around with him one more time,
I'll send your ass back to Texas.
Don't.
I think I'd like to keep him here a while.
I fold, Billy.
Folding three queens, now, are you?
You must be afraid
I'll go out a loser, Bell.
- I guess I just ain't seeing them.
- Well, I'll tell you what...
...as long as I'm breathing, let's play it straight.
I ain't sold my saddle like you and the rest of the town boys, Bell.
Or it's just Bob that smells like street shit over there.
On your knees!
Kiss my ass.
Bob!
Repent, you son of a bitch!
Sweet Jesus, I repent.
Leave off, Bob! You've gone loco!
I'm going across the street and have a drink.
I'm thirsty as hell.
I wanna tell you one last thing personal, Kid.
It's gonna be a loose rope and a long drop.
That last thump got my guts going.
I need to go to the outhouse.
My horse locoed on me once coming back from Pacheco.
I had to cut the second bar in his mouth and bleed him.
He died on me, and I ended up walking 40 miles.
I never was much for walking.
Well, I ain't never walked a mile since.
Fell in with a bunch of Mescaleros.
They was just off the reservation, and I was "suspicioned" of them.
But I had some biscuit on me.
I give it to them, and they just rode off.
That's a hell of a story, Bell.
You know, I believe old Pat's lost his sand.
He won't come on a man.
You ought not to talk about him that way.
You and him used to be pretty close.
He ain't the same man.
He signed himself over to Chisum and every other landowner...
...that's trying to put a fence around this country.
That's what you been doing, ain't it?
Selling us out and getting fat.
Ain't that easy, Billy.
You was a friend of Carlyle's, wasn't you, Bell?
You know I was.
I don't mean to be contrary, but did I ever tell you how he died?
I shot him three times in the back, blew his goddamn head off.
I don't wanna kill you, Bell.
Well, I sure hope you don't, Billy.
Then just move toward me.
Don't. Don't do it, please.
You wouldn't shoot me in the back, Billy.
- What the hell was that?
- There's been a shooting.
Get in the house!
- He's got a shotgun.
- Somebody get the sheriff!
How does Jesus look to you now, Bob?
Bonney's killed Bell!
Yeah, and he's killed me too.
Keep the change, Bob.
Bring me an ax.
Get back, I don't wanna kill you.
Go over to that livery stable, get me the best horse you've got.
Caught your horse, Billy.
Try him again.
By God, I think I'm just gonna trade you that fine brown horse for your buckskin.
What the hell, Billy?
I'll thrown in $ 1.60 worth of change if you can dig it out of old Bob there.
Would some of you people get him up off the ground and into it?
Anything you say, sheriff.
Hell of a mess, Pat.
Shot Bell and Ollinger and rode on out.
Yeah. Do me up good this time, Zeppy.
And leave the mustache on it.
- Is the boy around?
- Boy.
Speak to Mr. Garrett.
Yes, sir?
I want you to run down to my house.
Tell Mrs. Garrett that I'm gonna be home for dinner.
Then I want you to stampede over to the courthouse...
...find John Neully and the others standing around there...
...and tell them to come over here and pay me a visit. Got that?
John Neully, courthouse. Yes, sir.
Who are you?
That's a good question.
I believe you know of me.
Bill Kermit.
Wanted for horse-thieving down in Seven Rivers, ain't you?
That'd be me, sheriff.
Killed old C.B. Denning last year at Silver City...
...for calling you at cheating at monte.
That'd be me. Alamosa Bill.
Well, Bill, I'm gonna make you my deputy.
Listen, Bill, why don't you go out back...
...find us a couple of steaks and a mess of eggs.
And get one of them good bottles they got behind the bar there.
I wanna have me a bath.
It should take you about two weeks to make the circle.
Yeah.
- They say William Bonney's escaped.
- He has.
And he's in Mexico, I hope.
Where we should be if I had any sense.
If not...
...I'll go after him.
Got too much riding on it not to.
I figure that's why they elected me.
Anyways, I don't give a damn.
Brought him in once, I can do it again...
...if I have to.
You might say that you are glad to see me.
It's been over a week you've been gone.
I'm sorry.
I gotta go down to the saloon, there's a...
...drunk there causing a lot of trouble.
Goes by the name of Alamosa Bill.
Said he rode with the Kid down in west Texas.
Will you be blessing this house with your presence for dinner?
Looks like it's gonna be a long night.
- It's been a long year.
- Not now.
My people don't talk to me.
They say you are getting to be too much of a gringo since you've been sheriff.
That you make deals with Chisum.
You don't touch me.
You are dead inside.
- I wish you'd never put on that badge.
- Not now.
Or I won't be here when you get back!
We'll deal with this...
...when it's over.
I hope he gets away.
Well, he won't.
There's too much play in him.
And not enough in you.
You're late, Pat.
More cognac, please.
- Good of you to come, sheriff.
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- It's a pleasure to see you.
- Thank you, sir.
May I offer you some supper?
Oh, no. No, I think I might have a little of that brandy, though.
Of course. Some brandy.
I do hope you enjoy these rainy New Mexican evenings.
They have a fabulous melancholy to them.
They bring us closer to some greater design.
At least I hope so.
Allow me to introduce
Mr. Lewellyn Howland.
And this man is Norris.
These gentlemen are very concerned about the escape of William Bonney.
- A concern I'm sure you also share.
- He escaped from my jail.
Exactly.
This territory is vast and primitive.
There is money here, growing investments and political interests.
We must protect these investments...
...so the area can continue to prosper and grow.
- You rode with the Kid, didn't you?
- I did.
- Then you must be aware of his moves.
- Well, I know Billy.
- And he ain't exactly predictable.
- Oh, come now, sheriff.
For a man who's half outlaw himself and still smart enough...
...to be elected sheriff by Chisum and the ranchers, I expect better than that.
Can you bring him in, or should we look elsewhere?
Oh, I can bring him in.
If you and the big peckerheads don't mess things up by starting another cattle war.
I assure you, Chisum and the others have been advised to recognize their position.
And in this particular game, there are only a few plays left.
I'd advise you to grab on to a winning hand while you have a chance.
We're offering a reward of $ 1000 for the Kid's capture.
You can have 500 now.
Well, I aim to bring the Kid in.
But until I do...
...better take your $500 and shove it up your ass and set fire to it.
Commendable notion, sheriff.
Eno.
Well, now.
I'm gonna blow the top of your cow-humping head off, son of a bitch.
How's it going, Luke?
You are a son of a bitch.
I thought they's getting ready to trim you.
There's a whole bunch of us just fixing to ride in.
Well, I saved you all a trip.
Or somebody did.
I figured I'd lay back a few days.
Maybe more.
Well, it sure is pleasurable seeing you back again, Kid.
- You glad I'm back?
- Welcome home, Billy.
And did you miss me?
So much you had to take up with that low-down piece, old Hyatt.
Cómo estás, Silva?
Buenos dias, Billy.
Now, you're uglier than me.
How's it going, Beaver?
Eno, I thought you boys would be out in the Nueces or Colorado by now.
Well, I figured to watch you get stretched but might have knowed you'd show up.
Good thing somebody did.
These four rode in here this morning.
What's your name, boy?
- Alias.
- Alias what?
Alias anything you please.
What do we call you?
Alias.
- Hell, let's call him Alias.
- That's what I'd do.
Alias it is.
Thank you.
My, my.
You boys hungry?
- I didn't catch your name.
- I didn't give it out.
Well, I guess that's why I didn't catch it.
But I know yours.
And that's enough.
Hey, Silva. Do you remember that meeting with John Jones...
...and that old man they called
U.S. Christmas, down near El Rito?
- That old man they called U.S. Christmas?
- Right. See?
Seems John stepped on one of U.S.'s boots one night they was both in town.
Old U.S., he'd been out hunting buffalo for six months.
Now, he was mean and testy and damn near blind drunk.
He had on a pair of these flat-heeled, about half-length Wellington boots.
Them boots was the only thing he owned he put any store in.
And John stepped on one of them.
That old man just stepped back and said:
"Let's get to it."
So John said to U. S:
"If you're gonna get that riled...
...over a pair of foreign, lady-looking boots...
...we just might as well get the ball rolling."
So they went in the middle of the street.
And they took the 10 steps.
And John put three holes right through that old man's chest.
I must have known them from somewhere.
It's too soon for bounty hunters.
Alias?
What the hell?
Garrett?
I thought you was in Lincoln.
- What the hell you doing?
- You get your ass over there, Gate.
Howdy, Cullen.
How do you do, yourself?
What are you doing with that piece of sheep dip?
I'd like to blow his thieving head off just for riding through my town.
I ain't paid nobody no never mind.
Been staying in my own good hole.
Fact is, I'm thinking about going to Texas.
Kid broke out.
Killed Ollinger and Bell.
I thought maybe Gate and some of the boys might have a sign on him.
Well, I still want him for that train robbery up at Springer.
Gate's been holed up outside of town here with Black Harris and Sut Cole.
Been meaning to roust them out of here...
...but somehow or other
I just can't get around to it.
I don't know nothing about the boys,
I don't know nothing about the Kid.
Understand you've been riding for Chisum.
I'd rather be on the outside of the law...
...than packing a badge for that town of
Lincoln and them that's a-running it.
It's a job.
Comes an age in a man's life when...
...he don't wanna spend time figuring what comes next.
Well, it's gonna cost you some change.
I got to the point where
I don't do nothing for nobody...
...unless there's a piece of gold attached to it.
One of these days, when I get my boat built...
...I'm gonna drift out of this damn territory.
This town's got no hat size nohow.
Mama?
Where'd you put my badge?
I don't like it, Cullen.
This town is not worth it.
Tell you the truth, Mama,
I don't take a shine to it myself.
Anytime you're ready.
Company's coming.
Sheriff Baker.
Hey, Black Harris!
I wanna talk to you!
Whoa, boys.
Black.
I ain't seen the Kid, if that's what you're sniffing after.
But if it's straight-up one-to-one you want, then I'm your man.
I'm looking for sign, Black.
Us old boys ought not to be doing this to each other.
Ain't that many of us left.
Remember? You and me rode into this county together.
How long ago was that, Pat?
Oh, hell, about 15 years ago.
Pat, I know where the Kid's at.
I'll tell you...
...when you're lying proper on the ground.
It'll be the last words you ever hear.
Hey, look at that.
Look at them turkeys.
Hey, hold them critters, Silva.
Go on, kid, let's get them.
Watch this.
Get in there. Watch this.
Come on, Billy.
- Get out of the way, you son of a bitch.
- Grab him!
Move, Billy.
That's the way. Do it!
Got mine.
Both hands, man.
- What you got there?
- I got me a turkey.
Let me see that bird.
Oh, I could have roped four or five of them in if it wasn't for you.
Them is Mr. Chisum's cattle.
And this is Chisum's land.
- Where you going with it, Silva?
- Get your rifle.
You'll make a good living cow-thieving.
Give him a good laugh.
You want some coffee?
I could use some.
Name is Poe.
John W. Poe out of Fort Griffin, Texas.
Maybe you saw me last month in Santa Fe at Governor Wallace's.
The governor made me a deputy.
I figure he probably told you.
Already got me a deputy.
Two's better than one.
I answer only to the governor,
Mr. Norris and Mr. Howland.
I heard talk on the trail the Kid's in Mexico.
Don't figure to me.
Most likely, he's trying to get his old bunch together again.
- Which way we going?
- I'm going southwest.
That would be the Chisum ranch.
Chisum is a fine man.
Country's gotta make a choice.
Time's over for drifters and outlaws and those who got no backbone.
I'm gonna tell you this once.
I don't wanna have to say it again.
This country's getting old,
I aim to get old with it.
Now, the Kid don't want it that way.
He might be a better man for it.
I ain't judging.
But I don't want you explaining nothing to me.
I don't want you saying nothing about the
Kid and nobody else in my damn county.
Garrett to see you, Mr. Chisum.
- All right. Somebody else try him.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Chisum.
Mescaleros stole 40 head of horses last week.
Yeah, I heard they was off the reservation.
Bonney tried to steal a few head a couple of weeks ago.
Well, he says you owe him
$500 back salary.
He rode for me.
I treated him just like any other man.
Sheriff, tell me something.
Why did you ride all the way out here?
- Thought maybe you'd heard something.
- I'll tell you what I heard.
Billy the Kid is in Tascosa.
Billy the Kid is in Tombstone.
Billy the Kid is in Mexico, Tularosa,
Socorro, White Oaks.
And Billy the Kid is at my table right at this moment...
...eating tacos and green chili peppers with my niece, just like old times.
- You staying for supper?
- No, thanks.
Mr. Poe?
I... Yeah, yes, I could eat.
Fine. Bunkhouse is right behind the large barn.
Men usually eat when the cook lets them.
Interesting meeting you, Mr. Poe.
Perhaps I'll see you again some time.
Glad to be of service, Garrett.
But don't overuse it.
I appreciate the loan.
You gonna get him?
My friend.
Buena suerte until I see you.
Come to Mexico, Billy.
People know you're here.
I say this as a friend.
In old Mex he ain't gonna be nothing but another drunken gringo...
...shitting out chili peppers and waiting for nothing.
It's got a good edge.
There's a lot of land between here and the border.
And it's all Chisum's.
Better keep those sheep moving, or they're gonna end up on his table.
I have no quarrel with Chisum.
It is an old war that is over.
Let him alone...
...and he will let you alone.
Don't you believe it, my friend.
I must believe it.
Adiós, Paco.
You could leave, you could live in Mexico.
- Could you?
- Yeah.
I could live anywhere.
I could leave anywhere too.
- Have you ever been to California?
- Not yet.
I ain't either.
But they're sure pushing on me to go somewhere.
Yeah, your leaving would sure give Garrett some size.
I reckon he's given me about all the time he can.
Mexico might not be bad for a couple of months.
Depends on who you are.
I reckon.
There's a lot of us who'd ride with you.
Mexico won't be so bad for a few months.
I guess that depends who you are.
But if I was y'all...
...I'd be clearing out of here.
Gonna be some hard times coming down.
Remember me to whoever rides by.
Boy, get some water for these horses.
- All right about the goddamn...
- Hello there, Lemuel.
Well, if it ain't the limb of the law, Patrick J. Garrett.
Your booze is under the bar, where I always keep it.
Shake it up, it's got a little oil on it.
That's the fairest drink of whiskey you'll ever throw lip over, boy.
Know you around these parts?
I ain't ever rode through here before.
Don't seem the best way to be tracking a man down.
They're already talking about you in Lincoln.
I calculate you ain't been there in more than seven weeks.
When I want somebody to keep time for me, I'll ask you.
I'll stay here the night.
You take that trail east, then south.
I'll pick you up in Roswell. Five days...
...six at the most.
You might be able to find something out there alone.
Are you getting tired, Garrett?
Looks like you only got a couple more days left in you.
Yeah, well... adiós.
You want yourself a woman?
One come here from Albuquerque, run a cathouse over there. Name is Bertha.
Got an ass on her like a $40 cow, and a tit.
I'd like to see that thing filled full of tequila.
Say, you know something, you can't beat that, can you?
Howdy, ma'am.
Mr. Horrell.
- Hey, Tommy.
- Billy.
Didn't think we'd be getting to see you.
I felt obliged to come and pay my respects before moving on.
Sit down, Bill.
You picked a fine time to come, Billy.
I sure never figured on you taking on the badge.
Didn't figure on it myself.
I was just in town being sociable.
Rode in from Seven Rivers to watch you hang.
- Garrett swore me in when you lit out.
- Won't be having no ill talk at my table.
Fill yourself, Billy.
Another fried pie?
Don't mind if I do.
Never tasted anything so good.
Thank you, ma'am.
Billy?
Tomato.
I don't suppose you ran into old Pat, did you, Billy?
Can't say I did.
He'll track you down, Billy, and get you.
Pat Garrett's got more sand than most.
Yeah, I'm outlawed, for sure.
Old Alamosa here will see to that.
It wasn't long ago, I was the law, riding for Chisum.
And old Pat was an outlaw.
The law is a funny thing, ain't it?
Well, we best get to it.
Just got through putting up that new cottonwood door.
Used the old one for my son, John.
He got into a shooting with Olin Carroll.
He's buried out yonder there.
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Horrell.
John was a good hand.
Couldn't shoot, though.
Harley, you and Lee give me a hand with this door.
I don't suppose there's any other way we could work this out?
Well, let's get to it.
Ten steps?
Suits me.
You count them.
You ain't thought of another way, have you?
No, I can't come up with nothing.
Get to it.
One, two, three, four, five...
...six, seven, eight...
That wasn't 10, hoss.
I never could count.
At least I'll be remembered.
Howdy, old-timer.
You're wasting the best part of your day.
Hello, Holly.
- Bit off your graze, ain't you?
- A bit.
Hell, everybody knows he's looking for the Kid.
Everybody knows the Kid ain't in this territory.
Nobody's seen him.
Maybe he be outside there.
I wish he'd come get a drink.
Get himself a drink?
Yeah. Well, I had mine.
No need to run off, Holly.
He ain't out there, Pat.
You boys shuck them gun belts.
Let them lay where they fall.
- You boys carrying wages?
- What kind of wages do you mean?
Well, any kind of wages.
Thought maybe we'd just have a few...
...sociable hands.
Ain't no harm in being sociable.
Ain't no harm in being sociable.
Boy...
...go over there to Lemuel and get that shotgun...
...he's got his fingers wrapped around and bring it to me, stock first.
Do it!
It ain't no use, you getting mad.
I wasn't set on using that.
But those boys have been patronizing me real well.
No use getting him mad, old Pat.
We been patronizing him real well.
Now, I want you to stand over behind breed here.
Take the stock of that gun and rap him smartly on the back of the head.
Do it, or this bullet that's going through his chest...
...is liable to come out the other side and tickle your private parts.
Private parts?
- Lemuel.
- Yeah?
I want you to drag your fat ass over here so we can all see you.
You're crazier than a mule-humping goat.
Sitting there with all that law crammed inside of you, busting to get out.
I wouldn't give a sweet jerk in hell if the Kid did lay you out.
You used to be just like a daddy to that boy.
Boy.
Come over here.
Take Lemuel's hat and stuff it down over his eyes, gentle-like.
Those eyes ain't seen nothing but bad since he's been in this territory.
And I'm looking right smack-dab at it.
Now, I want you to go over there to that shelf of airtights...
...and give us a nice read, loud enough for us all to hear.
Let's hear it!
"Beans. Beans.
Spinach.
Eastern plums.
Beans. Beef stew. Salmon."
- Two is a better game.
- "Pears."
Listen, Pat, we haven't done nothing.
All we did was come in and wet ourselves down.
- "Spinach."
- Take it right from the bottle, Holly.
"Beef stew."
No need to stand on manners around here.
No, no, no.
Go ahead, have another one there.
"Climax tobacco."
Just keep on going there.
"AMK fine quality tomatoes."
He's trying to drown you. That's what.
Trying to get his bark back on him.
Thinks it's going to make him young, like the Kid.
"AMK salmon."
"Beans. Spinach and beans."
"Baked beans."
"Beans."
- Boy, this sure lights up and kill you.
- "Baked beans."
"Beans."
"Quality."
"Quality."
"Beef stew."
Tell me, Pat.
Are you afraid to take it to the Kid, or what?
Ever since you and the Kid have been together...
...you've just been a little short of supplies, you know what I mean?
"Lima beans."
Oh, hell.
I don't care about either one of you.
"Lard. Quality... Quality salmon."
"Plums. Beans. Tomatoes."
You just made me have a bowel movement in my britches, Garrett.
I ain't gonna never forgive you for this.
"Succotash. Beets."
"Spinach."
Boy.
When you see Billy...
...tell him we had a little drink together.
No!
No!
No. No.
It's ready.
Jesus Christ!
You working for Chisum?
Yeah. We're working for him.
Hello, Paco.
I will tell you about a house that I want to build.
No, not here.
For us, amigo.
It will be on the other side.
In old Mex.
I will sell my sheep.
And I will build the adobe bridge myself.
You know, Billy...
...I'll put a vine...
...a grapevine out on the veranda...
...and I will have three chairs...
...and I will sit in the middle one.
And anyone who doesn't do right...
...according to nature and my mother...
...I will blow his head off.
Billy...
Cómo te sientes tú, Billy?
Well, that ties it.
I'm going back.
Look who's here.
Hey, look who's here!
I was hoping that was you as soon as I seen your dust.
Well, I was hoping that was you.
I ain't shut of this country yet.
I should have knowed better.
Beaver.
Goddamn glad to see you, buddy.
You boys look grim. You need somebody back here to spur your flanks, don't you?
You just give us the word.
There's enough of us left.
Nobody's running us off.
Not Garrett...
...Chisum...
...or that goddamn governor.
Chisum killed Paco.
Hello, Rupert.
Take your old room.
Key's in the door.
Oh, Rupert...
...what ladies do you have hosting for you nowadays?
We just got some sort of an octoroon from south Texas...
...and there's Ruthie Lee and Pauline.
Well, I'll be up in Ruthie Lee's room.
She won't want to see you.
She's been with the Kid more than a few times.
Well, send her up anyway.
You want another one?
I don't care who you send up, Rupert.
Just make sure that Ruthie Lee's part of the package.
Come in.
- Hello, Ruthie.
- Which way do you wanna go?
I don't know yet.
Gotta ask a few questions first.
He was here a few weeks ago.
I don't know where he went.
Better do better than that, Ruthie.
You're gonna have to do me one more time, because I owe the Kid that much.
Now you tell me.
Fort Sumner.
Excuse me.
Clean it off real good, now.
We're getting to the best part.
You gotta pull hard there.
They been on for a long time.
Yeah.
Oh, yes. How is that tub?
Having a little trouble there, girls?
Jesus.
What room is Garrett in?
End of the hall.
Garrett?
Come on in. The door's not locked.
Well, where's he at?
Fort Sumner.
Yeah, well, I don't wanna hear about that.
If you don't get him, I'm going to.
Go down to the sheriff's office and find Kip McKinney.
Tell him to meet me downstairs.
Don't say nothing about nothing.
Thank you, Rupert.
Your jail empty?
I recollect that it is.
- Who's your deputy?
- Sack Oliver.
Well, I got the girls upstairs.
Locked up.
Take the girls over to see old Sack Oliver.
Give him the key.
Go on, give him the key.
And then bring Mr. McKinney's horse back. All right, Poe?
Where are we going anyway?
Fort Sumner.
There ain't nothing out there but some old cattle thieves.
Well, there's a couple of young ones there too.
No, I ain't going.
You owe it to me.
I do? For what?
For not killing you over at Rosewater...
...for getting you this job...
...and not seeing you run out of here.
For pulling you out of that snowdrift up at Chamas.
For coldcocking you over at
Stillwater's saloon last fall...
...and saving you from Rabbit Owen's biting off your ear and from just...
...putting up with you for a hell of a lot longer than I ought to.
Yeah.
Well...
...I hope they spell my name right in the papers.
Billy.
Cut the dust.
He's coming in, Billy.
Yeah, I reckon.
Maybe he wants to have a drink with me.
I'd just as soon ride in, get it over with.
He ain't gonna be there anyway.
Hell, I don't have nothing against the Kid...
...saving maybe he killed J.W. Bell.
Yeah.
I sure did like J.W.
We'll meet up on the other side of the fort, at Pete Maxwell's place.
I know old Pete.
Hello, Pete.
Heard you were back.
Obliged.
We'd like to bed down in your extra bunk.
No reason not to. I got no need for it.
Been on any drives?
No.
I recollect the time...
...Toddy Sparks got his horse stole.
Jace Summers stole it.
Just up and stole it.
It was up by Del Rio.
Old Toddy got even, though.
He sure did.
Put a rattler in Jace's blanket.
Bit him through the neck.
Buried him in a thunderstorm.
Summer of '71 it was.
Man, what are you, some kind of frog-watcher?
Take it easy. Wrong room.
You're goddamn right you got the wrong room.
- Who in the hell you looking for?
- Somebody else.
What somebody else?
It's cold.
It's cold.
Hello, Will.
Hello, sheriff.
You finally figured it out, huh?
Go on, get it over with.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Jesus.
I'm hungry.
I'll get you something.
No, I'll just see what Pete's got out in the cooler.
That's the Kid, Tex. Right there.
Go on, shoot him. Go on, shoot him.
Go on, shoot him.
Who's that?
Who the hell are you?
Hello, Pete.
Evening, Pat.
Easy. We come to see Pete Maxwell.
You chickenshit bastard.
Hey, Pete, who's that out there?
I want his trigger finger!
I want it cut off and nailed to a post!
Then I want him taken back to Lincoln!
No!

Well, I want each of you fellas...
...to buy yourself a $1 Ingersoll watch.
You can't break 'em with a hammer and...
...won't lose more than a minute a month.
- I know we're late, Mr. Andersen.
- You're two hours late!
Work starts around here at 6:00 a.m.
- Goes for everybody.
- Yes, sir.
We spent the night in Bozeman.
Town's empty as a bone orchard.
Everybody's lit out for the Ruby River.
- What for?
- Gold.
At the Ruby?
Played out years ago.
No. This is a new strike.
About 20 miles above there.
Almost to the Beaverhead.
Tell him, Smiley.
Well, the fact is, me and the boys thought...
...we'd like to take a ride up and have ourselves a little look-see.
Got 1,500 head o' steer to get to Belle Fourche before it snows on me.
You're hired on to move 'em.
- We'd like to help you out...
- LLike to help me out?
The others done pulled out.
There's only five of us left.
That busts it.
You work us night and day, and Christmas, too!
- Pay ya every Saturday!
- There's easier money around.
We'll do it this way.
We'll take a ride up there and look around, two or three weeks.
If it don't work, we'll get the others and come right back.
You have my word on that.
Don't he, boys?
That's right.
- Your word?
- Yes, sir.
Well, here's my word.
Get the hell off my spread!
Now!
Miserable.
Well, they run...
...clean out from under me.
Whole damn bunch of 'em.
I heard most of it. LLet me see that.
A fool comes to town with a fistful of gold dust and...
...every jackass in 50 miles around lights out after him.
My day a man'd stay with you on a handshake.
It's a different day, Wil.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I'll go over to the Bigelow place, see what I can turn up.
Maybe Henry...
Henry Bigelow's 60 years old, Wil.
So am I.
Kinda noisy around here.
It's been like this all week.
Any luck?
No.
I traveled 30 miles today...
...didn't find a single hand that could...
...throw in with me.
- Did you talk to Parker?
- Yeah.
His wife's gonna have a baby.
How about Miller?
His wife wants to have a baby.
Sucker's only been married three weeks.
Well, if you can't get your cattle to market this year, put it off till next.
What'll I do with this year's bills?
Pay 'em next year.
Hell, a lot of folks around here do.
No, I won't go on tick.
If your neck was any stiffer...
...you couldn't even bend over to pull your boots on!
Shut up and pour!
Did ya ever think of hirin' boys?
What boys?
The schoolboys.
Oh, sure, and women.
How about my momma in Cedar City?
She's only 92.
You ain't got a lot of choices.
There ain't a kid in that school over 15.
They're between hay and grass.
I need men.
How old was you when you went on your first cattle drive?
- What difference does that make?
- How old was you, Wil?
- Well, in my day...
- How old?
Thirteen.
And my old man's pants fit me.
"This convenient arrangement is designed...
"...to adjust ladies' long dresses to a walking length.
"It is worn around the waist, has two ends..."
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
'Afternoon, Miss Ellen.
Have you gentlemen decided you need some additional schooling?
Well, I guess we could probably use some, but we just come visitin'.
Well, come in.
Please, sit down.
It isn't often we get visitors.
We were reading from the Montgomery Ward Catalogue.
The grammar's quite correct and it's always most interesting.
Elizabeth, would you continue, please?
"...the longer of which has a nickel clasp...
"...which holds the bottom of the skirt to any desirable height...

Blithe.

Weren't?
"Bird thou never wert."
"That from heaven or near it
Pourest thy..."
Get away!
- What have you got?
- Nothing.
Homer, take your hand from behind your back!
And open it!
Stop it! Now stop it!
Sit down!
Give it up, Wil.
Can't move heaven and earth.
Well...
Whatcha thinkin' about?
You.
Stringy women like you live a long time.
Sisters have seen all their husbands put under.
More than likely you will, too.
And I don't wanna...
...see you end up somebody's fry cook.
I've been your fry cook for 40 years.
A pretty good one, too.
It's gettin' chilly.
Come on in, have a cup o' coffee.
I'll be in.
Damn Anse!
He put 'em up to this.
I'd better jump straight down their throat and get it over with.
Don't be hard on 'em.
They must've traveled half the night to get here this early.
Good morning, boys.
Good morning, Mr. Andersen.
LLooks like it's gonna be another fine day.
What can I do for ya?
Anse Petersen says you're lookin' for hands for your drive.
We come to put in for the job.
Well, any of ya ever been on a cattle drive?
Any of ya ever herded cattle?
Well, what can you do?
We can all ride.
Most of us can rope.
Couple of us are pretty good shots.
Well, that's somethin'.
You know, trail drivin' is no Sunday school picnic.
You gotta figure you're dealin' with the dumbest...
...orneriest critter on God's green earth.
A cow's nothin' but a lot of trouble tied up in a leather bag.
A horse ain't much better.
Speakin' of a horse...
Got me a little green broke filly over there.
Name's Crazy Alice.
Now if one of you was to stay aboard her, for, say, a count of 10...
...I might just keep that in mind come hirin' time.
Thank you.
Steady, girl, steady.
Easy.
Easy. Here we are.
Who's first?
Well, I'll try and saddle her while you're makin' up your mind.
Made up your mind?
I'll go first.
I'll start countin' when you hit the saddle.
Five. Six.
Seven. Eight.
Time!
Get off of her!
My name's Hunnicutt.
I'm 15.
And everybody calls me Slim.
Easy, girl.
I'm next.
Easy, girl. Easy.
She's rank. Keep your mind in the middle.
Bail off, youngster! Bail off!
My name's Homer Weems, Mr. Andersen.
And I hope I ain't rode all the rough off of her.
- You all right, boy?
- Yes, sir.
My name's Clyde Potter.
They call me Fats.
Tendin' toward the gut myself.
My name's...
His name's Bob Wilson. He gets excited.
I'm Charlie Schwartz. I'm Jewish.
I've settled it every place in town but here.
Must keep ya pretty busy.
All right, who's next?
I am.
Good mornin'.
Close the gate.
Did ya see that?
Here, boy. I think you can handle her now.
Keep it.
All right, break it up.
Break it up!
Come on, Slim, get back on the fence.
Hurry it up.
Settle down!
You all right?
Yes, sir.
I didn't see you at the school.
I don't go to school.
Got a name?
Cimarron.
That's half a name. What's the rest of it?
There's no more name.
I'm a mistake of nature.
That was a pretty good ride you made.
But I'll have to think you over.
You having difficulty seeing the board?
Homer, Bob, why don't you take these slates and pads...
...put them underneath the board and raise it up...
...so that everyone can see the lower lines.
There, that's much better.
Thank you, boys.
When you've copied your assignments for the week you may all go home.
I'd like to talk to these boys before class breaks up, if you don't mind.
Do you wish to address the young ladies, as well?
No, I don't think so.
I've nothing to say to young ladies.
Then we bow to the fact that it's a man's world and leave you to it.
Girls...
I don't expect to get to...
...Belle Fourche with one single head of beef...
...but I'm cornered...
...so I'm takin' you on.
Now this is the way it's gonna be.
I'm a man and you're boys.
Not cowmen, not by a damned sight.
Nothin' but cowboys, just like the word says.
And I'm gonna remind ya of it every single minute of every day and night.
This is the Double-O.
This is Belle Fourche.
In between is 400 miles of the meanest country in the West.
And the only way we're gonna get through is if...
...you take orders.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Bring a bedroll...
...a couple of good ropes...
...horse, if you've got one.
You'll get the best food in the territory...
...no rest, and damn little sleep.
And 50 big silver dollars...
...if we make it to Belle Fourche.
Now you'll show up at my place...
...first Monday after school's out, at 5:00 a.m.
And come with grit teeth.
'Cause, gentlemen, that's when school really begins.
Mr. Andersen?
Yeah?
All of us?
Come here.
Anybody, that tall.
They must've rode all over the territory to get that many brand-new hats.
You know...
...you're gonna have to feed these kids till my cook comes.
I don't mind.
I like the sound of boys.
Next one of you pulls a knife in this outfit...
...you're gonna learn better at the buckle end of my belt.
Now, what happened?
You.
What went on here?
He said somethin' about his mother.
What'd he say?
Your mother is a whore.
- You understand Spanish, Mr. Andersen?
- I understand.
So does Slim.
Clear out.
Get on your horse and clear out.
All right. There's plenty of road.
Give me back my gun.
I'm not in the habit of throwin' kerosene on a fire.
It cost me $30.
Send me a bill.
You're gonna get it, mister.
All right, everybody packin' iron unload it.
Throw it over here in this buggy.
And I mean anything that shoots.
Anybody holds out so much as a pea-shooter...
...may find himself hangin' by a tie-rope 70 foot up in a tree.
You ever fire that thing?
No, sir.
This hardware'll be locked up in the chuck wagon.
You got anything to settle between you, butt heads.
Now get rid of those bedrolls and...
...get mounted and we'll see how much you don't know.
All right, turn him loose.
Bring in the iron, Charlie.
Been smellin' that for 40 years.
Never could get used to it.
- You.
- Yes, sir.
- What's your name?
- Hardy Fimps.
Go rope one.
You'll do.
I've seen 'em fight all day, from dawn to dark.
Sometimes the young one wins, sometimes the old.
Young one's got more muscle.
Old one's got more experience.
That's the old one still standin' there.
- Keep his nose out of the water.
- Watch out!
Hang on to that line!
Steady, steady. Pull!
Slow, Weedy!
Watch out for those horns.
You got him.
Now hold him right there.
Pull his nose back now.
Keep his head back.
All right, take him out!
Pull!
Get him outta there!
You need some help?
Nah, they're doin' all right.
Mr. Wil Andersen?
What can I do for you?
Well, I think there's somethin' that we can do for each other.
My name's Asa Watts. How are ya?
This here's Henry Williams and Red Tucker.
They both ride with me.
We heard that you was goin' on a drive, needin' some hands.
You sure heard right.
Well, sir, we're the very best.
You fellas aren't from around here.
No, sir, we're not.
We're from Denton County.
We've been up on the Ruby River pannin' for gold...
...like every other damn fool.
These last 22 days, you know, all we got was $2 worth of dust and nothin' more.
Ain't that pitiful?
Now we're ready to get back to what we know, and that's cows.
What outfits have you worked with?
Well, sir, we've worked for every big outfit in North Montana. You name 'em.
No. You name 'em.
All righty.
There's Oscar West at the Triple-D...
...and George C. Thompson over there at McNeil...
...Dillard Fant at the Santa Rosa.
How long were you with Fant?
Well, sir, the last eight years.
What a lovely old gentleman he is.
If we weren't three of the damnedest fools you ever saw we'd be there with him now.
And if you were, you'd be in a pine box.
Sir?
I was pallbearer at his funeral five years ago.
Well, I've been caught at it, haven't I?
Mr. Andersen, I'm sorry. I lied to you.
I got all 'em names right out of the Stockman's Association Brand Book.
We're fresh out of jail, the three of us, and...
...I don't know, you tell that to people and they just turn a deaf ear on ya.
Well, I'm afraid I can't use you.
How do you mean you can't use us?
I won't use you.
Will you be like everybody else and not give us a chance to redeem ourselves?
I don't hold jail against you, but I hate a liar.
You're a hard man, Mr. Andersen.
It's a hard life. I got work to do.
Sir, before you get back to your work,
I'd like to ask you one more little question.
What are you gonna use for hands on this drive of yours, huh?
Them little-bitty boys down there?
Come on, you know better than that.
You know what you'll need to trundle 'em boys across the prairie?
A baby carriage.
Well, whatever I need I'll get.
I bet you will.
Good luck to you, Mr. Andersen.
Get mounted!
There's your saddle band.
They've been livin' wild all winter.
We'll finish breaking 'em on the drive.
We'll pick our strings by age.
Who's the oldest?
I am.
Get yourself a rope.
All right.
And here.
May I have some more, please?
Sure.
You eat that much at home?
We've been branding cattle all day.
Can't be that hungry. They're showin' off.
Good afternoon, mister.
Were you lookin' for me?
Who are you?
Name's Nightlinger. Jebediah Nightlinger.
I was expecting a white man.
Jim Wheeler. What happened to him?
Well, he got drunk on Sunday and married on Monday.
I came in his stead.
I told him the fix I was in.
He promised he wouldn't let me down.
He doesn't even wash his hands before he puts 'em in the pot.
I do.
Can you cook?
Apple pie.
Green apples sliced thin.
LLard, flour, salt, water to bind.
Sugar, cinnamon, a dab of butter.
Three slashes on the crust, one for steam...
...and two because your momma did it that way.
Good afternoon to you, lady. Am I correct?
Why, yes, indeed.
Mrs. Andersen.
Ma'am.
You ever been on a trail drive?
The Oregon, Chisholm...
...Santa Fe, some without names.
I don't know.
I like to travel with a man I'm used to.
You'll get used to me.
What do you want for wages?
All I can get.
This job pays $100.
A hundred?
That's the money.
Well, if you should get flooded out, stampeded out, frozen out...
...or scalped by wild red Indians...
...there'll always be substantial food on the plate and coffee on the boil. But...
...that'll cost you $125.
You're a pretty independent character, aren't ya?
It's been said of me.
Put your wagon in the barn.
Are all these small boys...?
No! They're my trail hands, God help us.
Well, doesn't anything larger wanna work for you?
We had a case o' gold fever around here.
They're all that's left.
I'll fix up some sugar tits to take along.
Hey, Dan. What's sugar tits?
This one suits me.
Smells of boy in here.
You're staring at me, children!
I feel your eyes on my back.
Now why is that?
Well, sir...
...you're the first nigger we ever saw.
Then it must be a treat for you.
Something different for a change.
Are you black all over?
Except for the white o' my eyes.
Is your, you know, your...
It is. Black, too.
See? He's the same as us, except for that color.
The same as you?
The same as you!
Oh, children.
My father was a brawny Moor.
Six feet six inches tall.
He bound his head in a red velvet cloth.
He wore a curved sword...
...forged from the finest Toledo steel.
He captured a lady...
...bright and dark.
He took her in his arms...
...and wrapped her in a warm quilt...
...and carried her off.
They came to a castle...
...and he battered down the doors with the trunk of an oak tree...
...and killed everybody in it!
Just so they could rest the night.
LLater...
...while she slept...
...he walked the parapets...
...and became a king.
Is that true?
If it isn't, it ought to be.
Blow out those lamps!
You, that lamp!
Do your work.
Don't be profane and don't listen to profanity.
Wash your feet daily.
Say your prayers nightly.
Yes, sir.
You have to go out in the world and prove yourself.
I guess that's right.
God bless you, son.
- Don't be fresh.
- I won't.
And don't come to any harm.
Don't worry, I won't.
So long, Gramps.
Sixty days oughta see me back.
I want two things.
What?
You home again and a string of blue glass beads.
You don't ask for much, Ann.
I don't need much.
Well, if ya run into any trouble, call Anse.
I'll think about ya before I go to bed at night.
You do and you won't sleep.
- Are you ready, Mr. Nightlinger?
- LLong ready, Mr. Andersen.
LLet's go to Belle Fourche.
Move 'em out!
Yes, sir! Move 'em out, Weedy!
Start 'em, Charlie!
Move 'em out, Bob!
Move 'em, Jim!
All right, don't move 'em over here.
Keep 'em over this way!
That's good, Slim.
Right pace, Homer.
Any faster you'd be runnin' tallow off of 'em.
That's money out of my pocket.
We'll try and make Still Meadows tonight.
Still Meadows.
All right, take 'em through.
Take 'em through. Come on!
Get with it! Head 'em down there!
Head 'em downhill!
Get up there, kid. Get up where you were!
Get down, Hardy!
Hey, there's a stray.
You want me to get him?
Easy, easy! Don't stop, go with 'em!
Go with 'em!
Go on with the wagon!
Easy, easy. Don't stop 'em.
Go with 'em! Go with 'em!
You were sleepin'.
I'm sorry, Mr. Andersen.
I pay a full day's wages, and expect a full day's work.
Drove you hard today, didn't he, children?
- You think it's gonna be like this everyday?
- Yep.
Sundays, too?
There ain't no Sundays west of Omaha.
Slim, give that to Hardy.
Watch it, it's hot.
I never noticed before...
...but most of the people I know are quiet compared to Mr. Andersen.
He's quiet, it just comes out loud.
That youngster's been following all day.
I know it.
Who is he?
A burr under my hide.
You just gonna leave him out there?
Mr. Nightlinger, you take care of the kitchen, I'll take care of the drive.
You know, in the late war between the states...
...I served under an officer...
...just like you.
Is that right?
As a matter of fact, I shot that military gentleman in the buttocks...
...just outside of Vicksburg.
I'd have hung ya.
They gave me a medal.
In my regiment, Mr. Nightlinger...
...I was known as Old Iron Pants.
You might keep that in mind.
Rise and shine! Rise and shine!
Hey, Hardy, you wake up!
Homer! Get up and go wake up good Slim over there!
Up, up, up!
Out of these sacks, into your britches!
Come on, Jim, get up! Get up!
My God, get up!
Don't let the sun catch ya sleepin'.
Mr. Nightlinger, what's for breakfast?
Stewed apples, bacon and biscuits.
Well, forget the apples.
Slap some bacon on a biscuit and let's go!
We're burnin' daylight!
Burnin' daylight?
All I see are stars.
You'll see a lot more of 'em if you don't move it.
Bring 'em on!
Bring 'em on, Mr. Nightlinger!
Go on. Stay with 'em. Keep 'em upriver.
Stay upriver, Mr. Nightlinger, there's some soft sand down there.
Keep 'em upriver, and let 'em go higher up their heads.
Well, come on.
Keep 'em upstream so they won't have to swim.
Push 'em upstream, that's it.
Good work.
Head 'em upstream more.
Hold 'em up in the canyon till they all get across.
Help! Help!
Come on.
Here's one of your strays.
You all right?
Better sit on his back and pump him out.
Get his feet up.
Move your gear into camp.
I won't charge you for the days
I've been following you.
You're hired on, just like the rest.
You work out, you stay.
If you don't, it's a long walk back.
You!
You almost got him killed, you know that?
- But I tried to tell you.
- The hell you did!
I tried hard.
If you'd have been out in that water we'd have heard you.
I couldn't get the words out.
You could've if you'd wanted to.
You just didn't want to bad enough.
Before God, I tried.
Tryin' don't get it done!
The fact is, you almost let your friend choke to death out in that river.
- I'd rather die than done that.
- Then you're a liar!
It ain't my fault I stutter.
LListen to me, you whinin' little whelp...
...you'll stop stutterin' or get the hell out of here.
You're gonna stop it or go home, do you hear me?
You son of a bitch.
What did you say?
- You goddamn son of a bitch!
- Say that again.
- You goddamn, mean son of a bitch!
- Say it faster!
You goddamn, mean, dirty son of a bitch!
I wouldn't make it a habit callin' me that, son.
I did it.
Did ya hear me?
I did it.
I did it.
Hey, Cimarron.
I ain't had a chance to thank you for haulin' me out.
I sure am obliged.
- Well, I figure I owe you for it.
- Yeah?
How much in dollars?
Well, I can't pay you in dollars.
I ain't got any dollars.
Well, money's what cuts it with me.
Hey, wait a minute.
I picked this up on the trail.
I know it ain't gold, it's just fool's gold, but it's kinda pretty.
You callin' me a fool?
No, no, I didn't mean it like that.
I got no use for it.
You write that yourself?
No, no. It's printed on paper.
I've been tryin' to learn it.
Well, there's nothin' to it.
It's just like arithmetic.
All you gotta do is just...
...count lines and spaces.
That tells you where the notes go.
It ain't hard.
LLooks like fly specks to me.
Some guy named Vivaldi wrote it.
It's kinda pretty.
If that's that ol' Tennessee sour mash, put a little in there.
Good for my rheumatism.
That comes with old age.
Yeah, miserable old age.
I hate it.
I'm not far behind you and I don't like it, either.
My oldest boy...
...would be close to 40 now. Middle-aged.
If he had lived.
You lost a son?
Two of 'em.
Went bad on me.
Or I went bad on them.
I don't know.
I can't figure it out.
You got another chance.
They're not mine.
They could be.
So as I went down to Denver with my cousin, LL.D. Grimes...
...then there was a hootchy-kootchy show goin' on.
When the fella wasn't lookin' we snuck in under the tent.
There was this gal up on the stage doin' a harem dance.
First thing I know, she dropped her dress and was naked.
- All over?
- From head to toe.
What'd she look like?
She had a belly button so big, you could've stuck your middle finger in it.
I saw my first one in Benbow, too.
Fifty years ago.
Probably the same girl.
Damned if he ain't almost human today.
He's been sleepin' better.
He's been at the bottle.
You mean there's bug juice in camp?
I seen him and Mr. Nightlinger swillin' it down last night.
Keeps it in a drawer in the chuck wagon.
Which drawer?
Come on. Hurry up. Give me that.
Come on, let's go. Hurry up.
Come on, Weedy.
Weedy, come on.
Hurry up. Everybody else is.
- You're wasting time.
- Gambling's a sin.
- So what?
- This ain't gamblin', it's stealin'.
- That's a bigger sin.
- Not if you don't get caught.
- Come on, just take one.
- Come on, Weedy, come on.
Holy shit!
Go on, Weedy, go on. Hurry up.
Watch out! Here he comes.
Innocence is wasted on me.
I don't believe in it.
What are you up to?
Nothin', Mr. Nightlinger.
Nothin' at all.
Boys are always guilty of something nasty.
What could it be this time, I wonder?
Nothin', I swear. Just standin' here talkin'.
If you're lying, remember one thing:
I could swallow each of you whole, without choking.
All I need to do is butter your heads and pin your ears back.
Hey, come on.
Hurry up.
Get goin'. Go, go.
Keep goin'.
LLook in with the liniment.
That's where my folks keep it.
- Hurry up.
- Come on.
Come on, Weedy, don't take your sweet time.
- Come on. Come on.
- Hurry up.
Hurry up, Weedy.
- Come on.
- It's not here.
- LLook around here.
- LLook over here.
Hurry up.
- Would you get goin'? We'll watch.
- Go on.
I got it.
Don't drop it.
- Hot coffee.
- Heard ya comin'.
I'm used.
That Fats!
He can sure sing those cows to sleep.
Fat boy isn't on guard. He was just here.
That's right. It's...
...Steve and Cimarron.
There's more than one voice.
What is this?
Weedy! You keep takin' long swigs like that...
...you're gonna miss your turn next time.
Pass it on.
Hey! There's two of everybody.
There's two moons.
I'm going to bed as soon as I can stand up.
Just don't wake up OI' Iron Nuts.
Mr. Brass Ass Andersen.
A bastard if there ever was one.
He made you stop stutterin' fast.
He really tromped your tail!
LListen, Fatso...
I could have given up stutterin' a long time ago.
- Why didn't ya?
- I didn't know anybody wanted me to.
This is the first time I've ever been drunk.
Oh, you gettin' sick, ya farmer?
- I've decided.
- What?
I've decided if OI' Iron Nuts tells me
I'm burnin' daylight just one more time...
...I'm gonna let him have it.
Have what?
It.
What's it?
I ain't decided yet.
What happened to that bottle?
It's coming.
You know who you sounded like just then?
Mr. Nightlinger.
That black son of a bitch cooks better than my ma.
Come on, you, we oughta be goin' before the old man finds out we're gone.
Yeah, come on.
Did ya ever notice how pink
Mr. Nightlinger's palms are?
They're kinda pretty.
Shit.
Shit yourself.
Shall we join 'em, Mr. Nightlinger?
When did you take your first drink?
It was on the occasion of my first broken heart.
And my last.
She was an older woman and wise.
Vastly experienced.
She told me she couldn't stand the sight of me for another minute...
...handed me a half-gallon jug of sour mash and fled.
And you polished it off?
Every drop.
I've been drinking sour mash ever since.
I was 17.
She was almost 22.
Her name...
...was Oceola.
I think these kids are rushin' it a little.
They're in a hurry to grow up.
Well, they won't get it out of a bottle.
They'll know that in the morning.
All down sick at once.
Must've passed a bad waterhole.
Well, this'll settle you.
Come on, son.
Back, wide.
Voila.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Mr. Nightlinger, I'd like some beans and cabbage for supper...
...with a big chunk of fatback in some red pepper sauce.
And make some gravy out of the grease.
I'll be back.
Hurry it up. We're burnin' daylight.
All right, son, tongue out.
Head back.
Wider.
Where do you think you're goin'?
Go get him, Dan.
Come back, you.
You ain't nothin' but a small child.
If you was a fish, I'd throw you back.
Hey, boys! LLook here!
LLook what I found.
LLook around and meet the boys.
It looks like he surprised us.
We surprised you, too, though, didn't we, boy?
You know better than to scream out now, don't ya?
What's the matter with you, son?
You're lookin' at me like I had two heads.
You're wonderin' where I came from, ain't ya?
You know we've been trackin' ya for days?
What have you got to say to that?
I can't hear you, son.
I can't hear you, son!
I won't say nothin'.
You're a quiet boy.
If I had a prize I'd give it to you, boy.
I like quiet boys.
Now, quiet boy...
...I'm gonna let you loose.
But, you point your ears now, son.
You won't run back to Mr. Andersen with them eyes rollin' back in your head...
...tellin' him that these bad men have been followin' us day and night.
You're not gonna say that.
You think you'll raise a commotion and get congratulated for it.
They'll pat your head and tell you what a good boy you've been.
That's not gonna do you any good, son.
You know why?
Now you listen to me careful, boy.
You know why?
Because I'm gonna come to you some night when it's real dark.
I'm gonna come to you on tiptoe...
...so you ain't never gonna be able to hear me.
And I'm gonna come to you with a knife...
...freshly sharpened on a stone...
...and I'm gonna cut you a grin down here on your neck.
It's gonna run clear across to there.
Do I make myself clear, boy?
Do I make myself clear, boy?
Is it clear to ya now? Huh?
Is it clear to ya?
- Is it clear?
- Yes, it's clear.
Go home!
No. No, I ain't gonna.
- You gotta stand watch.
- I ain't gonna.
- It's your turn.
- I ain't gonna.
Why not?
I ain't gonna.
- What's the matter, Dan?
- Nothin'. Just, just leave me alone.
Mr. Andersen, can I speak to you?
Go ahead.
Well, it's about Dan.
What about him?
He doesn't want to stand his watch.
- Is he sick?
- No, sir.
Well, did he break something?
No, sir.
To tell you the truth...
...I think he's afraid of the dark.
Come here.
What ails you, boy?
Nothin'.
- You nighthawked last night.
- Yes, sir.
- Everything went smooth.
- Yes, sir.
If you don't stand your watch, somebody goes short of sleep.
Carry your weight, boy.
Yes, sir.
I don't steal off you and you don't off me, not even a pinch of pie.
What the matter with you?
Your house is your house and my house is my house.
Mr. Nightlinger, you'd better start bein' real careful.
How does it feel to be scared?
You think I was too rough on the boy, is that it?
Yeah, that's it.
Well, I can't say I always decide right.
In that case...
...cut yourself a piece of pie.
Move easy. They're kinda jumpy.
They look funny from up here, don't they?
My glasses!
I'll get 'em for ya.
- Be careful, Charlie.
- Don't worry, I'll be all right.
Come on, come on.
Easy, boy.
Easy, easy.
Come on, boy, come on.
Come on, easy.
Easy, boy. Easy, boy.
Come on, easy.
Be real careful, Charlie.
Don't worry.
Get off him easy.
Just stop worryin'.
I found 'em!
Come on up. Hurry out of there.
Easy, Charlie, don't spook 'em.
They're crowdin' me!
Charlie!
Sometimes, it's...
...hard to understand...
...the drift of things.
This was a good boy.
He'd have been a good man.
Didn't get his chance.
Death can come for you anyplace...
...anytime.
It's never welcome, but...
...if you've done all you can do...
...and it's your best...
...in a way, I guess, you're ready for him.
Go on back to camp.
All of you.
Go on, son.
What's that?
LLittle Big Horn.
They didn't even dig him a decent grave.
Well, it's not how you're buried...
...it's how they remember ya.
I guess I better go into Fort Smith and...
...see if there's been any Sioux activity up ahead.
Keep the cattle headed due east.
Tell Mr. Nightlinger he's in charge.
Why not put me in charge?
Big mouth don't make a big man.
Cimarron, come here!
Them ladies ain't got their dresses on.
No, they ain't.
They sure are pretty.
Wonder who they are?
I don't know. LLet's go find out, huh?
Girls, come on. Come on.
Hurry up. Hurry up, get behind the wagon.
Move, move.
- 'Morning, boys.
- Ma'am.
'Morning, ma'am.
Fine morning, isn't it?
You on a drive?
Yes, ma'am, we're goin' to Belle Fourche.
Where's your headman?
That's Mr. Andersen.
He's over at Fort Smith.
All right, then.
What's your name?
They call me Cimarron.
I'm Kate to my friends.
And who's the one with the pretty pink blush?
This here's Homer.
Hello, Homer.
Ma'am.
How many men you got in your outfit,
Cimarron?
If you're going by age, we've got two that's 15.
My God!
If you're going by what we can do, there's 11 of us.
No offense.
In this kind of country a poor helpless woman likes to know...
...if there are any men around.
Men who can take care of us as we go along our way.
Well, we're gettin' paid a man's wages.
And you look man enough to earn them too, Cimarron.
Did you want me for anything,
Mrs. Collingwood?
That's Phoebe.
You're putting too much merchandise on display, Phoebe.
You better cover some of that up before you come down with pneumonia.
Isn't this a sweet-lookin' boy?
Wouldn't you like to come inside, honey?
You'd be surprised how nice we got everything fixed up.
I think that Homer just saved himself a dollar.
That leaves you.
Well, excuse me for sayin' so, ma'am.
You're old enough to be my momma.
Well, if I were, I'd teach you something.
LLike what?
LLike manners, for a start.
'Morning, ma'am.
Will you see the boys return to work while I chat with this lady?
Ma'am.
My name's Nightlinger...
...and I'm in charge of these boys.
I'm Mrs. Collingwood and...
...I'm in charge of these girls.
Well, I just heard from a highly excited youngster...
...that there were some soiled doves swinging through here.
What do you want from me?
Madam, you know young boys.
They dream of golden skin and unbound hair.
Even if I could lock them up they'd find a way of getting here.
There's very little I can do about that.
I'm sure you'd handle everything most tastefully.
It's a question of waiting for a more appropriate time in their lives.
Perhaps it would be wiser to wait until next year.
Or even the year after.
With any luck I'll be retired by then.
The first time should be in the back of a buggy with...
...a girl they think they're in love with.
All right.
We'll move on.
You're a charming and sensible lady.
What about you?
Well, I have the inclination...
...the maturity and the wherewithal...
...but unfortunately, I don't have the time.
You got 'em?
Yeah.
Can you fix it?
I think so.
Catch us by suppertime?
Do what I can.
Homer, drop out and help him.
- Mr. Andersen...
- I know.
They've been parallelin' us for the better part of an hour.
- What do you suppose they want?
- The herd.
Now you just go on about your business like you hadn't seen 'em.
I'll pass the word to the rest.
Think you can do somethin' kinda ticklish?
Sure.
I want you to fade back and...
...find Mr. Nightlinger.
What'll I tell him?
Tell him to load his gun and hightail it up here.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Andersen?
I can't find Weedy.
Well, I sent him back after Mr. Nightlinger a couple of hours ago.
I don't know where the hell they are!
LLooks like we're gonna have a cold supper.
You want me to go?
Son, I wish we could all go, but...
...we gotta stay put right here.
Here's some jerky.
Take a piece and pass it on.
As soon as it's dark...
...they'll be comin' in.
They're after the herd.
I don't know who they are or how rough they'll get.
But right now they think we're one man and a bunch of kids.
And that's what we're gonna let 'em think.
I know you're more than that, a lot more...
...but this is no time to try and prove it.
You act like you just came out of Ellen Price's grammar school and...
...you'll be all right.
Now scatter and get us some firewood.
- What's the matter with you?
- I should have told you.
Told me what?
They've been following us for a long time.
I should have told you, but I was scared.
- They said they'd kill me.
- Who said that?
The man with the long hair who came looking for work.
Don't worry, Dan. It's not your fault.
You got plenty of guts.
Now get out there and give 'em a hand gettin' that firewood.
Hello, there.
Remember what I told you.
Well, bless my soul.
If it ain't Mr. Wil Andersen of the Double-O!
We knew it was gonna take you a long time herdin' little boys and cows...
...but ain't no way we thought it was gonna take you this long.
Winter's comin' on, ol' friend...
...and we gotta get these cattle to Belle Fourche.
How far would you say it is?
I didn't say.
If you was to say.
Four or five days.
Two or three is more like it.
You know, I'm hungry.
And I remember you had a chuck wagon and a nigger.
Where are they?
They're behind us. I sent a boy back to find out what was holding him up.
Well, I know the boy.
Bring him on in here.
I don't suppose you mean this stalwart young man here, do ya?
Are you all right, boy?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Andersen...
...do I look like the kinda man to you that would beat on an innocent boy?
You look like the vermin-ridden son of a bitch you are.
Well, my sainted momma didn't think so.
You get over there and sit down.
Go on. Now!
And sit down!
And the rest of you boys, sit down, right now!
Now ol' friend...
...I'll have the gun.
That's right.
I'll also have the belt,
'cause you ain't gonna need it.
That's good.
Pick it up and bring it over to me.
I don't think you heard what I said!
I said to bend over, pick up the belt and bring it right here to me, now!
Pride.
Stubborn pride.
I admire that.
That truly is...
...an admirable quality.
To tell you the truth,
I wouldn't have picked it up, either.
Mr. Andersen...
...how much would you say that them cattle are worth apiece?
Maybe $17 a head?
Now, old friend...
...I am ready to be rich.
You, come here!
Right now! Get up!
You kept our little secret, didn't ya?
- Answer him.
- Yes, sir.
You don't listen to him anymore.
You gotta look to me now, you understand that?
- How old are you?
- I just turned 13.
Really?
By the time I was your age,
I had already killed a man.
- You done anything like that?
- No, sir.
I'll bet not.
- You're the runt of your family, ain't ya?
- Yes, sir.
Where are your glasses?
You had some glasses. Where are they?
Son, there's no glass in there.
You musta broken 'em, huh?
Say, look at that...
...I can see myself back home now.
And all them carpetbaggers calling me mister.
I'd like 'em back when you're through.
They've been in my family for a long time.
Well, you can have 'em back. Here.
All right.
We've seen what you can do with a boy.
How are you when they come a little bigger?
You mean you?
Yeah. Why don't you tell your boys to just sit this one out?
You love to make it happen, don't ya?
You havin' any of it?
Well, sir, you're...
...a pretty old man.
Yeah, I'm 30 years older than you are.
Had my back broke once and my hip twice.
And on my worst day
I could beat the hell out of you.
I don't think so.
You will.
Get away from him! Get away from him!
You're mine. All mine.
Now, come on, you get up, you son of a bitch.
You miserable wretch!
Mount up!
Stop, you son of a bitch!
Go to hell!
Turn around!
I want you to see this comin'!
I said, stop!
You're mine, you old bastard.
LLeave him alone!
Get back.
Clear back, all of you.
We're leavin'.
- What about them kids?
- They're not goin' nowhere.
Take everything but the fire.
- What happened here?
- Rustlers.
They've been followin' us since we started out.
Why would they do this to him?
Mr. Andersen put up a fight.
Ain't there anything we can do for him?
Yes, there is.
You can be men.
Mr. Nightlinger...
...you're scarin' the boys.
You wanna sit up?
No.
Could you drink some whisky?
No.
Is there anything...?
I want you to see that...
...these boys all get home.
I will.
Summer's over.
Just about.
I'm proud of ya.
All of ya.
Every man wants his...
...children to be...
...better than he was.
You are.
This may seem...
...a lonesome place to leave him.
But he's not alone.
Because...
...many of his kind rest here with him.
The prairie...
...was like a mother to Mr. Andersen.
He belonged to her.
She cared for him while he lived...
...and she's nursing him...
...while he sleeps.
What?
What are you doing?
We didn't want to do it this way, but we knew you wouldn't give 'em to us.
So, we're gonna get the herd back...
...and take it on to Belle Fourche.
You're gonna get yourselves killed.
We're gonna finish a job.
Better have a plan.
Turn me loose and we'll make one.
Cut him loose.
Dung heap!
Come on in!
What the hell's the matter with them?
Mount up!
LLook at that.
Come on.
You've been behind this all the time, ain't ya, nigger?
Not at first, but I came round to it.
You take your hat off when you talk to me, mister!
Now you're actin' mighty calm considerin' what it is I got in store for you.
What have you got to show me that I haven't seen before?
Don't you sass me, you black!
Give me that rope.
This is what?
You ever seen one of these?
You ever seen a nigger run?
Come on! Come on!
Get up! Get up!
Since you mean to hang me...
...I'd like to atone to my Maker.
You got one minute.
Speak your piece.
Where to begin?
I regret having trifled with married women.
I'm thoroughly ashamed of having cheated at cards.
I deplore my occasional departures from the truth.
Forgive me for taking Your name in vain...
...my Saturday drunkenness, my Sunday sloth.
Above all...
...forgive me for the men I've killed in anger...
...and for those I'm about to.
I think my leg is broken.
Don't let him get up.
Oh, my God, don't let him get up.
I think my leg is broke.
The other one is hung up.
You!
Son, please cut me loose.
Please!
I'll make it worth your while.
I promise.
Oh, thank you.
Don't! Don't!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Stop him!
They're just kids!
Now what do you want on it?
His name. Wil Andersen.
Anything else?
LLike what?
Well, it's usual to say something like,
"Rest in Peace."
"Eternal Sleep."
"In Fond Memory of..."
Was he a family man?
Did he have any children?
Yes.
Well, then I carve:
"Beloved Husband and Father."
That'd be fine.
I don't see it.
It's gotta be around here somewhere.
I remember that tree.
There must've been a heavy rain.
Washed it away.
We ain't never gonna find it now.
Come on in.
I think it's close enough.
Well, come on, we're burnin' daylight.
Cassidy, will you stop playing, please?
You've touched it for a year and you can not get better.
Sorry folks.
I'll play softer now.
Let me know if you mind, okay?
Parker, Inspector.
Parker, Mr. Governor.
Robert Leroy Parker vulgar Butch Cassidy.
"How did you get the name Butch?"
- I worked at a butcher shop.
- You want parole?
"Yes, yes, sir."
The only time he was arrested.
For stealing horses.
Despite being suspected of 3 round robberies
- Wait...
- Six?
- 12 is more fitting.
- Sheriff Bledsoe. You already know each other.
- Yes sir. It was he who arrested me.
- Hello, Ray.
- Hello, Butch.
"Were not you working in Utah?"
- I still am.
The sheriff came here to speak well of you when he heard about the conditional.
He said he released you from jail for a few hours...
... on the eve of sending you here.
That's right?
Yes sir.
"He was not afraid that he take advantage to escape?
- No?
"Why not?"
Because I promised I would not run away.
Promise me you'll stay on the side of the law, and I'll give you the parole now.
"I do not think I can do that, sir."
"Why not?"
Why it would not be true. Ray, you know I tried to walk the line, but I could not.
"If you want to be loose you need to cooperate."
- I, I know, I know, but...
But it would be a lie, sir, sir.
I'll tell you what I can do.
- I make a deal.
"Butch, he's the Governor.
I promise, that if I ever let go of the law in this state.
That's what you want, is not it?
IT IS...
I swear I forget the state!
Even if a train with money passes through Wyoming, I do not abide by it.
Would I bump into it, Ray?
- I tend to believe him.
- You see?
- I...
= Word of Honor
- I mean...
- Come on.
Ahh, my God!
Boy, there's an ice!
- Hú, how much is this?
I'll take this one.
And a handful of bullets.
No, I'll take about a dozen.
Liked it.
- Hi.
- Hi how are you?
- How about a photo?
- That's what I want.
Great. I have good things.
I have the best collection you've ever seen.
Can believe.
That's exciting.
Come on, look at this.
On here. Will impress you
- Yeah, that one.
"That will be three dollars.
- I only have two.
"No, three. That's the price.
"I only have two," I said.
- Three.
"I said two bucks for hell.
"Good for you, it costs two dollars."
Stay still.
Come on, I want to show you something.
Good evening.
Good evening.
I want a Guinness.
- I was asking myself,
What's up there?
- Bedrooms.
If you want to show your curiosity, give her $ 20. She shows you one.
I'm not that curious.
Now it's up to you. What do you say?
I have a revolver under the table.
Do not do anything stupid.
Let's pretend we're just playing cards.
Right. What am I going to do...
It's for a hundred dollars at the table.
You will see me and put another hundred dollars.
Let's continue playing until all money is on the table
It's ok?
Right. Come on.
$ 100... and I'm going to put another $ 100.
I think I'm going for another $
5oo, and we're done with it.
"I think you're bluffing."
- Let's see if I am.
I have a pair of three, and five bullets pointed at your belly.
Tone! Damn it!
- Hey! This weapon is new!
- Great, then it should work!
Get the sheriff!
- Something wrong, sir. Le Fors?
"He did not cross here."
"Are not the traces of him you were following?"
"Yes, they did, but he did not cross here.
No traces on the other side
He passed this channel
How do you know that?
See these shiny stones?
His horse kicked them.
There is mud on top of the others.
- He's up there.
- Why do you think that?
It took him a whole night and a ride to get here.
"And such a place gives a great position."
- Against us.
We are in greater numbers.
We can lose some men.
Let's get him!
He did not do something so bad that we need to arrest him
Are you afraid to climb?
He did some damage to my Saloon but many of them open it from time to time
I tracked it down to 10 days and now I got it.
"But I can not go up and get him by myself."
"No, that would be suicide.
- Depend on us.
- We?
Anyone want this?
Let's go.
It seems they do not want you as much as I do!
But I'll see you again!
Try to remember my face.
The name is Le Fors!
Hey! Listen if you're there. I'm the guy you stole the gun from yesterday!
I had to buy another one.
That cost me $ 12.
I want to talk to you!
Listen.
I'll get this new gun... and put here on this stone.
Did you see?
- I'm here because I want to do you a favor!
- I'm making you one now.
- As?
- Not by squeezing the trigger.
Right. I think you will not, fordi...
You have no reason to fear me!
You also noticed that.
I am also outlaw.
That's why I followed you.
But I suck at tracking so I followed the group.
And here I am. You have to admit it's very clever.
Or very stupid.
- What the hell!
If you kill me you will not listen to me.
I bet this gets better hot.
Mit navn er Butch Cassidy.
You must have heard of me.
- Maybe not. Do you have a name?
Yes.
"Boy, you shoot well.
"Is that the favor you said?"
I'll get there.
The way you escaped yesterday was something very special.
But I would not be there if I was not so dumb
You need to admire my sincerity.
I do not have to do anything.
Trying to steal a game in a crowded casino is stupid.
Okay, all right. Maybe not stupid.
Maybe it's the wrong word.
But who can handle a revolver like this...
I should not be sitting here eating cold cereal in the middle of nowhere.
Here's the favor I'm going to do to you:
I'm going to teach him to steal a casino...
"You're good at what you do, and so am I.
"What are you good at?"
In thinking .. Plan.
Stuff like that.
I'm as good with my mind as you are with the gun.
- I work alone.
"I saw that you're very successful at it.
Let me tell you something.
I could kill him here.
So do not say I'm stupid.
I'm as smart as you, understand?
With that in your hand, you're a genius.
How do I get out of here?
- Hello, Butch.
- Good morning, Harvey.
- I was looking for you.
- IT IS?
- The train passed some weeks full of money
I did not find you to help me steal it.
- I was in jail for a year.
"I guess that's why I did not teache you."
It must have been.
There is nothing much.
The Lazy Eleven cows are now Circle Z.
Okay, guys, let's see you try.
Leave the.
That black over there.
Hello, O.C.
Hello, O.C.
Hello, O.C.
Hello, what have you been doing?
"I'm glad to see you!"
"Nice to see you, too."
You will not believe what's going on here now.
Supposedly outlaws, and cattle thieves too.
They are not. Just boys in the majority.
But what bad luck.
I thought the judge had given you two years.
You left early, did not you?
- I made a deal ..
"What kind of deal?"
Just an agreement.
Hey Butch, wait a second.
Listen, over your hut...
Emma and I used your house while you were away.
- I hope you do not mind.
- No, O.C.
Nice to see a feminine touch in place.
She did not find the broom this morning.
Butch, let her take care of it.
She'll be here soon.
Go make us some dinner.
Is she cooking, too?
You're a lucky man, O.C.
What is this?
We have our own saloon now.
Very good.
O.C., the next time you steal something, it better be women.
Hey you, the music. Stop!
This is my friend, Butch Cassidy.
Straight from
Wyoming to Laramie.
Butch and I are going to leave you idiots in shape.
Let's get things organized here.
Who does not follow, will be fired...
I'll tell you something else ..
Friends? A joke!
Right, we surround the whole place.
Get out without your guns!
And with your hands up!
It's a hunt group.
They surrounded us.
What are we going to do?
Think of something.
We surrender.
- Come on. Outside you.
- Come on. We have a long way to go.
No, not him.
Hi, Butch
Wait!.
Why do not you arrest him?
He was in prison when Lazy
Pupan's cows were stolen.
How do you know?
"I was there when he was released.
What kind of deal did you make, Butch?
What?
To get out of prison?
It is?
Did you bring them here?
I...
Do not be so silly, O.C.
I'll kill you, Butch.
I'd try to avoid him when he leaves.
Congratulations on a long life.
You were released a week ago and have already returned to Brown's Hole.
Get yourself a job or something.
Stay out of trouble.
I do not want a job, Ray.
This life is not for me.
What about your promise to the governor?
It was in Wyoming.
"And that does not apply in Utah?"
- No.
Have the decency to think of me
I do not want to arrest him again!
It would be very embarrassing.
Right, Ray, same deal. I'm out of your jurisdiction.
"How many places can you promise to get away from?"
- It's a big country.
Perhaps. But there is more law than ever.
Not old fools like me waiting for the pension and hoping not to be killed.
Young people, full of moral passion!
You will not make deals with them.
My God.
What are you doing out there?
- Cool place you have here.
- Yes
We, outlaws, live well.
What you want?
- I thought about what you said
- About what?
About you and me to unite.
Oh?
I heard you work alone.
Not long ago, you wanted to join me, am I wrong?
Now I'm not so sure anymore.
You are very temperamental.
On the other hand, you also have good qualities.
It's ok.
What's your name really?
Longabaugh. Harry Longabaugh.
It is not an outlaw's name.
You also have no outlaw face.
It's better to do something about it.
- IT IS! As?
- I do not know.
Get a scar, leave a mustache, I do not know.
- I'm leaving a mustache.
- At where?
Right here. See?
"How long have you been the cuktiva?"
- Not long ago.
- How much time?
"Not too long.
It just grows slowly at first.
"Should we steal anything or not?"
- Yeah, we should steal something.
"How about a train?" Let's steal a train.
- A train?
You do not go out robbing trains.
This requires practice.
We have to work together for a while.
To progress
- Casino - All right.
That casino where you failed last week.
"I can not go in there." They would recognize it.
- Yes you can.
Oh, God, no.
I listened. Stand still 'cause I'll fix it.
What are you doing out here for nothing?
Do you think it's funny?
Do not.
No one notices a tramp.
Is not that what you said?
Come on, let's get out of here.
Is playing
Did you see the money in that safe?
I'm not going there.
It's not so bad.
You get used to the smell.
- Do you get it?
- Yes. Come now. You do not want?
"You said it was not so bad."
- I lied.
I took all the steps ..
You will love.
Have we met before, have you?
You're no stranger to me.
I have a common face.
"Everything in me is kind of average.
- It is a pity.
- Where are you from?
- Canada.
You look Canadian.
This is ours. Dear
What is that room?
The red room.
But you can not enter with $ 20 only.
Forget the expenses. The red room looks good.
Ruby, use this one. The spendthere here wants the red room.
- Let's share it with you!
- Share?
My name is Butch Cassidy.
This is Harry the possum.
"I've heard of you."
"Why do you want to share us?"
You look good people and I do not want to kill you.
But he would kill. Look at him.
He's an animal!
"What do you get?" About $ 20 a week?
- Yeah, I get $ 22.
If we divide we will be rich for the next 10 years.
And no one will suspect you.
They'll think I did it.
"Because I'm Butch Cassidy outlaw.
"And he's Harry Opossum."
"Now open the safe!"
"Open up, Eliah.
I'm going to have to knock you out so you will not be suspicious.
- Knock off?
- Not to look like we're involved, idiot
"Where do we leave the part of you?"
- Are you going south?
One kilometer from the town there is a fork leading to Steamboat Springs.
Follow for 3 km until the shortcut of Yampe.
There are two large marshes there. has a large cavity...
...on the right. climb halfway
How about under the mattress down the hall?
It is also a good place.
I'm next.
Butch, I've never hit a woman before.
So do not hit her.
Let's take it. It might be nice to have a woman on the rails with us.
You may even fall in love and marry her.
- It was great! What are we going to do now?
"Do not get too comfortable."
Hey, where the hell are you going?
"Well, Butch.
- Excuse me.
Okay. Go get your teeth.
Next.
"I do not want to cut my hair."
- Sit down, come on.
Come on, I have not got all day.
Stopped!
Or cut your nose!
Now slowly.
Very slowly when getting up.
- Now, call the guard. Call him.
- Guard!
Go there! Go!
Who would say!
Have you been to Telluride before?
"No, I do not think so.
You would remember if you had been.
Great place.
Many outlaws lurk there in the winter.
Great hotelsnn elegant restaurants
"Do you think we're wanted?"
- Perhaps.
Because?
I do not know.
I've never been through this before.
That makes you important.
Well, if you want your name on a wanted poster, it's better to be something better than Harry Longabaug...
Minh mother liked.
No, it's not possible, Harry.
"I used Harry Alonzo for a while.
- Alonzo?
Because?
That's my middle name.
Harry Alonzo.
I'll keep it a secret
- Alonzo - What's wrong with Alonzo?
Let me see Harry
Cherokee Charlie.
Buck Barton.
Johnny Ringo.
No, he already owns it.
Lucky Wilson?
Oh, come on. Can you help me.
I need inspiration.
Have you ever done anything interesting in life?
"Well, I was in prison someday.
- At where?
- In Sundance, Wyoming.
Okay. Kid Sundance.
Sundance Kid.
Yeah, I liked that one.
I liked too.
Actually I liked it so much, I think I do.
You can be Butch
Cassidy if you want.
Hey, it was me who was stuck there, not you.
This is my name.
Sundance Kid.
There's nothing like it, Sundance.
You will love.
It's Telluride!
Hands up!
- Yeah, I already loved it.
- For there.
That's good.
Now give me everything you have.
It's in here.
- I can help you?
- Just stay still. Do not move.
I'm standing still.
It's you who moves.
Is this one of the outlaws that goes around here?
Why are you trying to steal innocent people?
I need $ 500.
- $ 500 dollars?
"Or what you can give."
- I'll get the rest of the next one.
- The next popde to kill you.
"Why do you need all this?"
"We have a little farm out of town.
"You and your wife?"
- Me and my mother.
Had a bad year.
The plantations did not avenge, the cattle died.
We can not pay the bank, and they will come in the morning to receive.
"You forgot the hungry dog."
Shut up, Sundance.
What are you doing?
"Shall I give him the $ 500 dollars?"
- All?
That's it.
Do not forget to tell everyone that you know me...
That Butch Cassidy gave you this.
Butch Cassidy?
- You do not know who i am?
"No, I'm sorry, sir.
Well, I am a well known outlaw.
Maybe not so much here but in Utah, Wyoming...
"I think I heard about you, Mr.
- Cassidy.
Yes, that's right, that's right!
Dutch Cassidy.
I do not know about you, but I'm freezing.
Those $ 500 will buy us a lot of good will here.
Did you see the way that old man looked at me?
Like I'm some hero.
Is that what you want to be?
A hero?
Did not you ever want to be a hero?
Have children admiring you?
When I was a child, my hero was an outlaw.
Mike Cassidy.
I even got his name.
He was the best, Sundance.
"I could beat him."
- what?
"You've never seen him."
- I can beat him.
You think it's so good, huh?
I suppose Dr Holliday's battery too?
- I'll pop his head wherever he is.
"Be." He is dead.
You did not say he was good.
- Hi.
- What?
It's dangerous to be here alone.
Mostly with money.
We will accompany you so that no one appears pull a gun and shoot his belly.
He would steal it and bleed it in the snow.
Oh! Thank you
Good luck!
See, Sundance, we've recovered our $ 500... and the old man has his farm... and we bought a lot of good will.
And it did not cost us anything.
That old man is going to tell everyone how Butch Cassidy is a nice guy.
Do not you mean Dutch Cassidy?
Let's go
"Can I get you another drink, sir?" Cassidy?
"No thanks, Jack.
Here it is.
"What are the five dollars for, sir?"
- what?
"The five dollars... what are they for?"
- Do not know.
- Stay with them.
- Thank you.
I never thought I'd tire of fun after two weeks.
I need action.
Lily?
- Not again
I have to do something to keep me from boredom.
I could now.
Let's go
I bring a message from Hoffman Mine.
He says they die like diphtheria flies.
"Why me?"
- I'll tell him.
He's the doctor.
We have a load of serum in the Mail.
But it's snowy. No one get there
It seems that you are not getting to him either.
I'm looking for volunteers but I do not think anyone is willing.
Good morning Miss Daisy.
"Butch, I saw an old friend of yours today.
- Saw?
- I was in the store and saw O.C ..
- Hanks?
How many do you know?
"I said you were always here."
- Said?
"He's eager to see you."
Still need someone to take the serum?
- Need.
- We'll take it. I and he.
Come on Buck.
Give me one good reason to be doing this.
- Only one. Because it's perfect.
"Not Butch, that's certainly not perfect.
"We could have gone to the south where there are roads.
"Hanks could do that, too.
The good thing about this is that he will never think of following us here.
That's because he's smart.
You're staring the wrong way.
We were bored, were not we?
This is an adventure.
How far is it from this place that we're going?
40 km.
A 40km trip on this?
Just one way.
It's just a way.
It does not have to follow by 40Km in this.
Let's get it easily.
As?
I do not know.
"What do you call it?"
Delight in the snow.
"You go through the snow like that?"
- Yes.
"Do you have more of these things?"
- Yeah, in my cabin.
I do not know, it seemed a lot easier when you did it.
- I've been doing this my whole life.
You will learn quickly.
- Yes
Everyone does this, until they get used to the skis.
- You need to bend your knees.
- The knees.
Hey, there are no mysteries.
- There are some tricks.
- Yeah, like what?
How to stop
Sundance, are you okay?
No more rest.
Let's continue.
I can not.
Are your legs cramping?
They died two hours ago.
I'm freezing.
Freezing? You're sweating.
"Let me take a look at you."
- I have a throbbing headache.
- I bet you got it.
- What?
- Diphtheria.
- Oh no!
Certainly from one of the girls in Telluride.
It's the 1st. they pass on diphtheria to someone.
Let's go. I'll help you get up I will not be able to.
Continue Sundance.
Save yourself
There is no reason for us both to die.
You'd love that, would not you?
Then you would be a real hero.
Dead heroes are the best.
Shut up.
They could build a great monument here.
"Here jazz Butch Cassidy, outlaw and hero, who died by taking serum... for sick children and dogs. "
- Shut up, Sundance!
To hell with that!
You will not be a hero to the at my expense, Butch.
- Come on, get up now!
- I can not.
Yes you can.
Yes you can, you know why?
Because we have the damn serum here in our luggage.
We got the serum right here.
On here. Get up Drink this.
"You do not drink the whey, you donkey!"
"What is to be done with him?"
I saw a doctor do this once.
He used a glass tube with a needle.
He snapped at the guy's arm.
My God.
Wait a second. Here it is.
You should for the serum in the glass tube.
- As?
- I do not know.
Here it is.
- Wait a minute.
"You almost did it.
Please try again.
Oh shit!
You had to get sick!
You had to bring me here and get sick!
- I should leave it here!
"That's what I've been up to!"
Just... go to hell!
What... what is this?
Did you hear something?
Hello there!
We brought the serum!
We came from Telluride with the serum!
Why did not you come sooner?
- Amtes?
- We've been asking for help a week ago!
Son of a bitch!
I'm with a man here who's dying!
- She died here.
Who died?
My wife. Their mother.
Well, Butch.
Then you finally got your parade.
Sundance, next time which I mention "hero",
Shoot me.
You know what.
We should steal a train now, right?
I'll be patient.
Be patient
A train requires a lot of planning.
Let's get out of here. You need to know schedules.
Changing routes, things like that.
"And you need at least four men."
"Four men?"
Yes. Mike Cassidy and I stole the Denver Rio Grande in 1987.
We stopped him with ease.
We opened the freight car in the blink of an eye.
But..., we put dinemite on top of the safe, and we lit up.
We had no experience.
We were very dumb.
We exploded the safe on the floor of the car.
He was trapped between the rails.
We did not pick up or move the train.
It was horrible.
We tried everything.
"Did you just leave it there?"
We leave
Maybe it's still there, as far as I know.
Listen, we should...
- What's it?
- Nothing.
Act naturally, but go behind a tree.
That was for giving me, you pig!
Are you you
I did not deliver!
It's insane. My own men shoot me.
- Sundance?
- What is?
What happened?
They did not hit you, and they made a hole in me.
- Let me see.
- Is nothing.
I had never been hurt in the shootings I was in.
You will be fine.
There's a good doctor in Circleville about 50 miles from here. You can?
Yes, no problem.
Let's get out of here.
- I just have to stop a little.
- It's ok.
I need to get down.
Pond or bleeding.
"No, it's not like that.
- So how is it
Take a cartridge and open it.
There's a tool in my bag.
- Pour into the wound.
- Are you sure?
Do it.
- Now it lights up.
- What?
- Take a match and light it.
- No.
"Then give me a match and I'll do it."
- No.
Butch, that's the only way to stop the bleeding. Come now.
This is going to hurt a lot and it can kill you.
It hurts a lot.
If it does not, it's going to go out, damn it.
You look so much better.
You need to wash.
What's your name?
Mary.
- Where we are?
- About 1.5 miles from Circleville.
You should not talk too much.
I'll tell him you're awake.
Tell him in an hour.
The doctor said that you will have a full recovery.
How long have I been unconscious?
For a long time.
Hi, look.
We thought it would be a good gift when he woke up.
Mary shaved it.
It got much better as well.
Hey, Butch.
- As for Mary...
- Yeah, what about her?
If you still can not think it can not give.
Well, it's best not to ..
In your state and everything.
Besides, she's my wife.
- What they want?
"Are you really Sundance Kid?"
- Who are you?
"Robert Leroy Parker Junior, sir.
I'm Sam.
Samuel Maximilian Parker, sir.
I told you to get away from here.
Okay, I was sleeping a lot.
"Your mother says you have homework.
"I barely have it."
She's very strict, Dad.
Moms are like that.
Take care of them.
"You can not trust women."
- Come on
"Do you know Butch Cassidy?"
- He's an outlaw here.
"Yes, I know old Butch.
- What's he like?
He's short.
A little little guy.
With small, burning eyes.
It looks like a mole.
- Mai ugly the devil.
- Let's go guys.
Sundance does not feel very well.
You can see that he is dekirando.
Let's go.
Good evening, Sundance.
- You bastard!
- They do not know?
That's how she wants it.
And I agree too.
"When was the last time you saw them?"
"The day before I was arrested.
Do not they think it strange that you stay out so long?
This is how it always was.
They think it's normal.
- I'm sending money.
"Sooner or later they'll find out."
I've been thinking about it.
- Good night Good Night.
"I want a dozen pork ribs."
- Yes ma'am.
- It's a lot of Parker paper. This is expensive.
- Yes sir.
"Give me 2 pounds of steak."
"I'll see you in a minute, ma'am."
And take off the fat.
I do not pay for it.
- Closer.
- Right.
"What are you doing, Parker?"
- She asked me to take the fat off.
If she does not like it from somewhere else.
"There is no other place.
- Aha!
And stop bleeding the meat.
Very slow.
"Now it's my turn to be Sundance.
"You're still Cassidy.
I do not want to be Cassidy!
He's an ugly dwarf!
So you're an ugly dwarf.
Mom, Bobby does not let it be Sundance.
Bobby, let Sam be Sundance for a while.
Be it Cassidy.
"I do not want to be Cassidy.
- Great. My own children.
"Cassidy does not do anything good.
- You heard?
Cassidy does not do anything right.
And then I said: Butch... if you put the dynamite on top of the safe it will not open.
But Butch is stubborn as a mule and a lot uglier.
I do not know how you handle it.
And yet he put the dynamite on top of the safe... he lit and there was a huge explosion.
When the smoke had dissipated the safe had crossed the wagon - and was caught in the railroad tracks.
"What did you do then, Sundance?"
"Yes, what did you do?"
Being smarter than Butch.
How did you get the money out of the safe?
Thank you, Mary.
- What I did not tell you is that we stopped the train on top of a bridge.
- A bridge?
Did you stop the train on a bridge to steal it?
It's a perfect place, Robert.
Even with the safe stuck in the rails,... was hanging on the bridge, so I just needed Butch to hold my feet...
I hung up and took all the money out of the safe.
It was incredible that he had not let go of his head.
Boys, why do not you get the
Curley from the cream separator.
Why do you speak ill of me in front of my children.
I speak ill of you
What are you trying to do to me?
I'm just telling stories.
Do not say that what happened to me was with you.
They think Butch
Cassidy is some idiot.
Maybe he is.
Excuse me, Mary.
Is very good.
- What's the matter with you?
- I do not know.
Yes I know.
Today I heard in the city that
Mike Cassidy is stuck in Wyoming.
Rob! Are not you going to try anything like take Mike out of jail or something?
Do not.
Mary, you know...
Let his arrest, make you understand that what you do now is right.
"Be glad you're not there."
- Yes I stay.
I know the last few weeks have been difficult.
I'll be fine.
As soon as Sundance has the strength to get out of here.
This water rose another 5 cm.
Hurry up Parker, we have to open.
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good Morning.
It's late afternoon.
Four minutes late.
Where are you going, huh?
- I have to leave for a while.
- because?
Because someone who wants to kill me is in town.
"Does he know you're here?"
"Not yet, but you'll know.
If I leave now he will not hurt you
And after he's gone?
I'll stay hidden for a while. let things calm down and then I'll come back.
"It's going to start all over again, right?"
- No! No you will not.
And why are you taking this?
Because you do not leave without it.
Where are the boys.
I want to say goodbye to them.
They're with Sundance in the creek.
I'll be back.
I promise you that.
Mary, I could not stop O.C. from coming.
I know that.
It's not your fault.
It's just how things are.
The one you are.
Something always happens.
- Bye, Robert.
- Mary?
- How are you doing?
- Do you want to try?
I'd like to, Sam, but I can not.
"I have to stay away for a while.
- because?
- Something happened.
"Not that you go."
I do not even want a son anymore, I have to go.
So is Sundance going?
Yes, Sam.
I think so too.
Bobby, give your father a hug.
Hey, try not to fight too much in my absence, right?
I kept it for your birthday, but
You have to take care of it for me.
Do you want to hold it for a moment?
Listen well here, okay?
You know how I say that Butch
Cassidy, is he an ugly bass?
Well, that's not true.
He's a really nice guy... and a little smarter than I said.
Not the worst guy I've ever met.
I want you to remember that, right?
What was that?
Anything.
Why do not you bother this guy?
If I kill him, I'll go back to the starting point.
And he shoots better shoot than I would probably kill me.
"But then your troubles are over, right?"
- Great.
Who is this guy?
- I do not think I heard him.
- What did you say?
- Hanks.
What did you shoot me?
Yeah, listen to Sunsance. He did not look at you, shoot me
"Then it's all right."
- Oh, he almost killed me.
- Sundance!
You're not 100 percent yet.
- If you falter you can lose an arm or a leg ..
"I will not hesitate.
"How can you be sure?"
- I've been practicing.
Throwing in bottles?
They do not shoot back.
"Just tell him I'm here."
- No.
"Then I'll go there."
- OK Alright.
Where are you going?
"Listen to O.C., I do not want any problems.
- What did you say?
That I want no problem.
Is this your new system?
Infiltrate people from behind?
I'm trying to save your life.
Cutting my throat?
I've never killed anyone and
I do not want to start now.
"But there is someone out there who would kill you."
Who?
Sundance Kid.
"I have no quarrel with anyone by that name.
"Yeah, you do not?"
When you tried to kill me at Ogden
Orchard, you hit him and not me.
And he's not the forgiving type.
So if I was you, I would go out the back door and go.
You're bluffing.
There is no one out there.
There are sim, O.C.
Believe me, he's the best I've ever seen.
Better than Doc Holliday.
O. C. Hanks!
Come on, you cowardly pig!
Go O.C., disappear from here, while I distract him.
He wants to fight, Butch
O.C. Hanks does not pull anyone's nose.
When I finish him, Butch... it's your turn
I heard you have a complaint.
I do not like people to make holes in my body.
I can understand that.
How long does
About a month, maybe
I wonder if you've recovered.
I think not.
Am I right?
- I'll get the sheriff.
- Call... but later.
But we'll find out, will not we?
It hurts, does not it?
Tell me Sundance, do you like water?
Want more?
I bet you're a little slow, are not you?
- Come on, O.C., or I'll shoot you!
- I'm ready.
"Get your revolver, kid.
- You first.
It's 17 o'clock Get out on the fifth ring!
He pulled it out before!
Got it before!
He is dead.
You shot the heart.
I never knew how to count, the bastard.
He did not even hear it.
"I did not want to kill you..."
- I know that.
I just wanted to put a hole in it.
- I had to shoot very fast.
- I know that.
I've never killed anyone before.
I shook them, but I never killed them...
Are you sure he's dead?
"Who was this guy?"
- Who?
Hanks.
- It was cool.
- Thank you very much.
- Whereby?
You should say he was a pig that deserved to die.
"Does he have any family?"
"Only five children.
- Had she?
- No! Stop torturing yourself.
He had no family. Just an old witch with whom he lived.
If you're going to get into shootings, you can not choose just orphans for that.
You have a visitor, Cassidy.
- I do not know anybody. Go away.
- Your lawyers.
When you want to leave, shout.
Lawyers? They're in the wrong room.
It's me. Butch.
- Butch?
- Cassidy.
You became somebody boy.
You are now a lawyer.
No, I'm not a lawyer.
Are not you a lawyer?
What are you doing here?
We came to get you out of here.
I do not want to go out.
There are other methods.
We're going to give you a real lawyer.
The best of Wyoming.
Cyrus Antoon, if necessary.
Do you know how much it costs?
- How much?
"I do not know, but lots of money.
We took the money in the bank.
- Which bank?
- Anyone we choose.
Damn it! She shifted.
- Where is the bank?
- Over there.
We have a deposit to make.
Right. Just hand over your weapons first.
We have to protect this until you're in the safe. It's the that our boss said
And we have to get the guns,
That's what our boss said.
Damn, I have to see this.
I'll be right back.
What should we do?
Strangle everyone.
Excuse me. I did not see you.
Here, boy, get 5 cents.
Buy a new bag of popcorn.
- It costs 10 cents.
- What?
Then get 20 cents. Buy two bags of popcorn. Sorry lady.
Sundance, the door Come on.
Thank you very much.
Hands up, everyone.
Keep Calm We'll be leaving in a few minutes.
Keep everyone in sight.
- What are you doing?
- This is enough.
How so, enough.
For Antoons Fees.
When will we have another chance like this?
That's all we need.
I'm trying to straighten up.
- You call that straightening up?
"Stealing just a little."
This is enough.
I'm saying!
Sundance. Look that. Little children working for the damn railroad.
- Hey, Butch!
- Harvey!
- I got your message.
Carver and I worked on this train to see what we found.
Apparently there is a train full of money that will leave in a few days of Frisco.
- Who is he?
- Oh sorry.
This is Harvey Logan known as
Kid Curry, Bill Carver, Harvey and
Sundance Kid.
You have not heard the best yet.
It's a mint train!
There's a cash press in Frisco.
Every once in a while they take a load of money they printed... and carry it.
On this train.
"He leaves the day after tomorrow for Salt Lake.
"No, I think I'll quit."
All right, excuse me. We do not need you.
I'm with you.
"And who should plan the robbery?"
- I.
- You think you're the only one around here
What do you think?
- This way, yeah.
And we can only steal a train if you show us how?
- Right - So show us that.
Why the hell!
"Lords of the Jury, have you reached a verdict?"
"We have arrived, Your Excellency.
We awarded the defendant Mike Cassidy innocent.
Court dismissed.
Next case in 10 minutes.
It is the best country in the world.
Ray, Ray, how's it going? Are not we going in the saloon to get us drunk a little?
"You will not get drunk, Mike.
Not as long as you do not.
- What?
I have a hunch that
Butch Cassidy... stole the bank in Montpelier to pay mr. Antoon.
God bless you.
I think you owe him something.
The Governors of three states accepted... that if the Butch come back willingly... at the same time, they renounce all charges against him.
It would be great Ray.
The hard part is finding it.
You can do it.
Listen here. People tell you things, they do not tell me.
Talk to him and fast.
If he commits an assault, the agreement is undone. Now, get out of here.
I do not have to agree to this Bledsoe plan.
It's only to follow that fret that he takes us to Cassidy, and then we get him and the Kid.
- I've been thinking...
- It may be dangerous.
What do we do with Logan and Carver?
Why do not we do it at work alone?
Two men just can not steal a train.
Requires at least four.
"And they must be on the train by now."
- You believe?
The damn train does not stop! He passes straight through!
Nobody on board!
There is no way to make the driver stop.
"And the train has a detachment of cavalry."
- Cavalry?
A wagon full of them.
The horses go in the front wagon.
- That ruins everything.
- Not necessarily.
That train will not stop for horse guys next to the rails.
You're right. We have to get rid of the horses.
And after stealing the train?
Are we going to run?
"And how are we going to make the damn train stop?"
"Why does the train stop?"
"Has anyone seen Butch Cassidy?"
He started off in that direction.
Along with Logan and Carver.
Thank you guys.
This is the last time I steal a train with you, Butch.
- Did you hear that?
- It's about time. My legs are numb.
"I feel like urinating."
- I just did that.
"I'm looking for Butch Cassidy.
"I think he went that way."
"Where's Butch Cassidy?"
- I do not know him.
Listen, sir, if I did, I would not tell you. Even if he killed me.
The mint train.
You two are thinking better, no?
For starters, I thought of that, right?
I just wanted to be sure.
"There seem to be many."
- I know.
We can not deal with so many.
They will not need to act right.
Very well.
Are you ready? So it is now.
Jump, you miserable ..
I can only count on you.
Do you think we can do that?
- Do not know.
- I think we'll find out, uh.
I'll get the driver and the stoker.
Stay between the cattle car and the Cavalry.
It's ok. Good luck.
- Continues.
- That's what I thought I would do.
You chose the wrong train to steal, my friend.
There is a whole contingent of cavalry on board.
Not for long.
- Butch, we got problems.
- What is?
Harvey said the horses were ahead of the soldiers. It's the opposite.
- Damn it!
"They're behind them.
"That changes the plans a little."
- I guess so.
- Stop the train -
You want to get off?
What do you think if I blow your brains out?
"You can keep the cavalry." in that wagon for a while?
- No problem.
Vilte, and make it seem like there are more people than you.
"How many do you want me to have?"
"I do not know, a whole brigade."
Give me your revolver.
Well, you're lucky not to use it.
The cartridges are wet.
Give me a few minutes to get in and settle, right?
Right. Stop!
You have wet cartridges.
Wet cartridges do not fire.
Want to test this theory?
I've never felt so safe on board a train.
With all of you soldiers on board.
We will do our best to get you safely.
- Why are we stopping?
"I do not know. I do not see anything."
Is that water?
Give me that.
Hello! This is a robbery.
Open the door please.
Do as I say and open the door.
I can see one of them.
- What is it?
- Kerosene.
What do you want with kerosene?
Well, I have a match in my hand.
Are you going to try to guess?
- How many up there?
- Do not know
"How many are there?"
- $ 25 thousand;
Let's take two, please.
There is much more there.
- I just take clean two.
- I can help you with that.
Why are you so helpful?
This is funny. You know how annoying it is to get on this wagon every day.
I can imagine that.
All right, come on.
Climb up and enter you.
They're stealing the post office car, right?
Yes. Are there any wounded?
- No.
Will you do nothing to stop them?
Not yet. I do not want to rush you.
They can hurt some civilians, sir.
- Let's wait...
- But Captain!
This is the American cavalry!
When they try to escape, will we come upon them like a hawk?
Let's go back!
I hope they do not create courage.
I only have five more bullets.
"I'm not really sure.
- Let's go now.
We have them now.
They are coming in.
Get out of the way!
Let's see if we can knock them down.
"If you do not mind, you'd better not try that."
- Play then.
Excuse me.
Thank you very much.
- That's heavy.
"Then try to run with it."
Shit! No more bullets!
Sundance, I can not open the door.
- Your suspenders!
- What?
Give me your braces.
I had an idea.
- It's stuck.
"Let's get all the ammo."
Where's the machine gun?
I do not know.
Come on, Sundance!
Men are right, horses!
Let's get them!
At where...?
Where are the horses?
"Are you in charge?"
- Yes.
"We need horses that are rested."
"Take whatever you want."
They're right there.
We got it!
You shot some pretty good shots, you know that?
They are only sldados.
I stare at them anytime.
IT IS? Some day, sooner or later someone will get us.
In that case Butch, I vote in the "afternoon."
I said you would have the poster you wanted.
Motherfucker! We're going to get famous!
ROOSTER COGBURN
I漵 the law, Pecos.
We want you for train robbery and murder of the engineer.
Get your hands on top of your heads.
You bastards.
You bastards.
Rooster J. Cogburn, step forward.
Are you Rooster J. Cogburn,
Oeputy Marshal for Western Arkansas?
You know I am.
A deputy who shoots and kills 64 suspects in 8 years, is breaking the law, not upholding it.
Le漵 get this straight, Judge.
Only 60 of them died.
All were shot in the line of duty or in self defense or attempting to flee.
You have served this court for almost two lustrums.
You're a strong man and a brave man, Rooster.
And you have, at times, executed your duties faithfully.
But all too often you have acted with excessive zeal and...
Wha漵 a lustrum, Judge?
- 5 years. Oon't interrupt me.
Pay attention to me.
This is not just a formal reprimand.
Investors go where the law protects them, not shoots them.
Is that the kind of law my deputy got yesterday?
I was proud to tell his wife
I shot his killers.
It seems you can't serve this court without breaking heads and spraying bullets. The West has changed but you haven't.
I want your badge. - They don't know these new-fangled laws out there.
They're still shooting in the same direction, at me.
Your badge, Cogburn.
You let yourself go. Look at your belly! You can't even close your coat.
You drink too much.
- I ain't had a drink since breakfast.
And I only wear this coat in your court.
It was good enough when you needed me.
You've gone to seed, Rooster.
Next case.
Lieutenant, roa飐 out ahead.
Rock slide.
Can we get around it?
- No, sir.
But there's a shallow down river to take the wagon across.
Column right, ho.
Breed, we can't move nitro over those logs.
I漵 just dead wood, sir.
I漵 easy to move.
Chipley, Grimm, dismount.
Start moving those logs.
Rawlins! Bryant!
Get the ropes. Help him.
The war is over.
The US Cavalry lost again.
Just like I told you.
Give me my money.
Oon't you trust me? - Pay up, Hawk, or try takin' the gold without me.
Oon't tempt me.
Any fool can blow nitro.
The last fool who thought that blowed himself up.
Alright, move. Fast.
We got four days' hard ridin' and that gold shipment won't wait.
Gone to seed, have I?
Gone to seed!
A man does his job, defends The Code, and what does he get?
Oisgrace and abuse.
- Judge say, you abuse justice.
I abuse justice? There ain't no justice in the West no more.
Men with sand in their craw, pushed aside by duded-up Yankee lawyers who won spellin' bees back home.
That ain't St. Louis beer.
- Kansas City.
Well, I don't like it.
Neither does Sterling.
Too sweet, ain't it, General?
Well, give me my jug.
- Judge Parker say lock it up.
Who's payin' the rent here, him or me?
You can't lock up a man's whiskey.
I'll give you one minute to get my...
Oon't shoot.
I'll get it for you.
Oon't shoot.
Until you've heard what I say.
You have said enough, Judge.
None of it to my credit nor liking.
May I take a drink with you and General Sterling?
If you don't mind such seedy company.
Rooster, you were my best Marshal.
You could be again.
That account is long overdrawn,
Judge.
Old friend, le漵 let bygones be bygones.
I have an important assignment for you. - You seem to forget, Judge.
You hung up my guns, remember?
I am retired, relieved, and rejoicing.
"I painted her, I painted her..."
Chen Lee, turn off the light.
No doubt you've heard of Hawk's latest outrage.
The Army believe he took the nitro for another robbery. Time's short.
You know the territory and the scout that set up the ambush.
Breed?
He run with Hawk now?
He's the best scout I ever had.
Good friend, too.
He never done a wrong thing till he killed that Wells Fargo agent and run away with the payroll.
We need a man with grit, Cogburn.
The governmen漧l be mighty grateful.
How grateful?
For the return of the dynamite,
500 dollars. For Hawk, 1,500.
Now, that is information more to my liking. - I thought so.
I want him alive.
I want him to answer to me, not you.
Then we'll see about your badge.
- I'll charge my retirement rate:
Double salary, double expenses.
Can you afford me?
Rates noted and accepted.
A group of my deputies will act as your posse. But i漧l take a while.
Take a while? L漧l take a miracle.
Them lily-livered lawbrokers won't risk their necks, or you wouldn't be here. - You'll need this.
Oo the job, and i漵 yours again, permanent.
Well, it goes against my grain.
I'll ride at first light.
Orunken cat.
Tha漵 right. In spite of the fact that you locked up our whiskey.
Tell them deputies to meet me at Bagby's.
If you can find any.
See who they have to come to when they got a real job to do?
The old rat killer.
Probably got another lustrum in me.
What is lustrum?
5 years, you Chinaman.
You people come here and we help you.
You won't even learn our language.
Maybe you're right.
Here you are, sweet lady.
How're you doing little darling?
Go ahead. Hurry. As fast as you can.
Wolf. Watch. Go.
They're settlers passin' through.
- I know.
Come, child.
Welcome to Fort Ruby.
I am Reverend George Goodnight and this is my daughter, Eula.
We offer you the hospitality of our settlement.
We are Go飐 servants here.
And we must ask you not to sell ardent spirits or guns to the Indians.
Civil law and Go飐 law forbid it.
This is the law we go by, Sister.
So don't waste your preachin' tryin' to convert us.
Please do not strip these people of their dignity with liquor and your worldly ways.
We beg you.
This is for your collecting plate.
Now, will you leave us be?
We're gonna camp here, rest our horses and take our pleasures, with no more preachin' from Go飐 servants.
A brand from the burning.
- Wha漵 that you say?
Our work, sir, is to pluck brands from the burning.
If you don't want to be plucked, then at least show us courtesy.
I do believe you're better at cluckin' than at pluckin'.
You're an unpleasant sort of fellow.
I'm the boldest sinner on the
Arkansas River. People remember me.
Only evil can come of your presence.
Temptation is the Oevil's spawn.
You callin' the Oevil, Mister?
- You do the Oevil's work.
I'd shoot a man of the cloth or a lady. So don't provoke me.
I'm not afraid. I wear Go飐 armor.
I do not fear what man can do to me.
I do not fear a skunk.
I simply do not care for his odor.
I'm warnin' you.
You have ridden the Hoot-Owl Trail and tasted the fruits of evil.
But justice will catch up with you to demand payment.
The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness in His name.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of death, I fear no evil, for Thou art with me.
I've had enough Sunday school.
Out of my sight, both of you.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me in all my days.
And I will dwell in the house...
She put the fear of God into you, Hawk?
Rooster, welcome.
- Bagby. - Good to have you back.
Huntin' trip?
- You might say. Big game.
The Hawk. You seen him?
- He went through here yesterday.
With a wagonload of heavy cargo.
Had nine men with him.
Which way'd they go?
- Fort Ruby way.
The Winding Stair Mountains.
Took the trail out of Webber's Falls.
Fort Ruby? Last time
I heard of that it was just a memory.
There's still a settlement.
Mostly Indians.
Run by a Yankee preacher and his daughter.
Judge Parker's promised me a posse.
When it gets here, if it gets here, send it on after me.
I ain't waitin'.
Why don't you have some of Winona's catfish stew?
I'd love to,
Winona, but the trail's hot.
If I had my druthers, I'd pull a cork and jaw with you. So long.
See you later.
Give him a drink. He's thirsty.
- There's gonna be trouble.
He's thirsty. You want it, do you?
I want him to drink every drop.
Come on, make him drink it.
No, father.
Jerry, hitch up the wagon.
Out. Out into the fields.
Jerry, get it hitched.
Quick, now. Le漵 go.
To the fields. Quickly.
And lie down.
Hide. Lie down.
You are all nothing but beasts.
Murderers.
- Let go of my horses.
I warned you.
Move that wagon out.
For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.
Our fathers lie together, Wolf.
Two decent men trying to help and understand each other.
And whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it.
Goodbye, dear friend.
Goodbye, Father.
Miss Eula.
Go ahead, shoot.
We're not armed.
Seems there's been enough shootin' here, Ma'am.
I'm of a different brand than them that did it.
Rooster J. Cogburn, US Marshal.
You're too late, lawman.
Too late to stop 'em. But not to hang 'em. What happened?
Last night a company of gunmen ravaged the settlement, killed my father and many Indians.
- I'm sorry.
Wolf's family was killed.
They will pay for it, son.
I promise you that.
For those that take the sword must perish with the sword.
Matthew. 26:52.
Oh. Yes, Ma'am.
I figure the leader is a lean, blue-eyed villain.
He looked like that.
- That was Hawk, alright.
I'm trackin' him for the government in Washington City.
He stole some guns and nitro from 'em. Plans to rob a bank.
And will you stop him?
- Tha漵 my intent.
My orders are to arrest him, take him back to Fort Smith for trial.
Tha漵 one hanging I will attend.
But there are nine of them.
Well, Ma'am,
I got my Navy Colt, a Winchester and a packet full of cartridges.
And a prayer on your lips, I hope.
You will have need of it.
And the government promised me a posse, which I figure will be long on promise and short on posse.
Go with God, Marshal.
- God, you and the boy, Ma'am.
I'm taking you to Bagby's trading post. You'll be safe there.
Gather your belongings.
- We're not going anywhere.
I must stay and continue my father's work.
I will be both preacher and teacher.
I admire your sand, Sister, but you should know this is no place for a woman alone.
I will look after myself, and I have done so all my life.
I won't allow it.
- You have no say in the matter, sir.
I have a lot to say. As Marshal,
I am responsible the citizens' safety.
You will pack and come quietly, or I'll arrest you and take you anyway.
To whom do you think you are talking, Marshal?
You is "to whom" I'm talking.
You are bigger than I am, but physically, that is all.
In this situation, that is enough.
- You mean you will use brute force?
That is exactly what I mean.
Oh, yes. I will go.
But not because of your threats.
Saddle our horses, Wolf. We'll look for grangers to help us rebuild.
You have a lot of brass, Marshal.
You will have need of it before we're through.
She sings a loud tune.
To make sure the Good Lord hears me.
Yeah. Go saddle the horses, son.
They there?
- Yeah.
You pushed your luck too far.
Now we got Injuns after us, too.
We gotta risk it. We're going through.
- Hold it.
When I signal, follow.
When I throw the stuff, move fast.
Alright, Hawk.
Bring it on down.
I'd say I earned my money today.
You did what I paid you for, tha漵 all.
Rooster.
- Yeah, i漵 me... and wha漵 left of Fort Ruby.
Take care of 'em, Bagby.
You know Miss Goodnight?
Are you alright, Miss Goodnight?
- I'm fine, thank you. Hello, Winona.
Them deputies show up yet?
- Not a sign of 'em.
I'll bet my drunken cat they ain't comin'. I ain't waitin' for 'em.
Bagby, that is a strong-minded woman.
Be careful, or she'll end up owning your store and you workin' for her.
Keep the faith, Ma'am.
See you at the hangin'.
Wolf, come with me.
Protect yourself.
Wolf, on my horse.
Bye-bye. Thank you.
Mr. Bagby, I'm purchasing this
Winchester, the scabbard and shells.
Thank you for your hospitality.
But, Miss Goodnight...
- Goodbye, sir. God bless you.
Marshal Cogburn.
Alright, what is it?
We're riding with you.
- You're riding nowhere with me.
We won't slow you down, sir.
- Right, 'cause you ain't comin'.
We'll have to ride hard to overtake them. - We ain't goin'.
I ride hard and alone.
I eat light and sleep on the ground.
Understood. We should reach
Cheyenne Springs by sundown.
Breed. Hurry up.
Hawk don't trust a hired gun at his back. - Just at his side.
Not there, neither. Bree飐 not on our side. Bree飐 a whore.
Hawk paid for his services. He'd sell us to the law if they paid better.
Le漵 get movin'.
We're fightin' time.
Marshal Cogburn, just wait a minute, please.
I feel that you are angry with me.
You are an almighty trial.
This is man's work, and dangerous.
For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
I will make sure of what my father's murderers reap.
You will make sure of nothing, sister.
I will.
You do your crocheting or fingernail fixin', but stay out of my way.
Just a minute, I'm not through.
It came to me at Bagby's that I must help pursue these men.
I cannot shirk it. You're a peace officer. I'm sure that you understand duty.
I dreamed that life was beauty.
I woke and found that life was duty.
I don't suppose you know the poems of Ella Sturgis Hooper?
No, ma'am, and I ain't interested in hearing 'em. Forget your duty.
Your own General Lee found it the most beautiful word.
What do you know about Lee?
That he was a good Christian and was whipped by Yankees.
If they ever give 'em the vote,
God help us.
Easy!
Keep her over here. Slow.
Speed it up.
We're sure takin' a chance with this nitro.
With broke backs.
I'd rather go down shootin'.
The nitro. Support that nitro.
- Get it under there.
Leroy, get back here.
Get to prying here. We'll hold it.
Get under it. Easy, easy.
Wheel just popped. Put it back on.
We'll be out of here in 10 minutes.
The axle's broke, Hawk.
- Then fix it. Oon't waste time.
The axle's broke, Hawk.
I漧l take till morning to fix it.
Nothin' is keeping that gold from me.
Nothin', you hear? Nothin'!
I'll ride with Breed to Goldstrike, he'll size up the bank, I'll plan.
If this nitro ain't in town by Friday, the game's over. - Hawk,
I'm gonna ride along with you.
Gotta get to a Ooc, before i漵 quits.
Ride along, but don't hold me back.
I ain't got time for no cripple.
We won't let you down, boss.
- Oon't. I ain't a good loser.
Wolf, I got a hunch we're just a little way from trouble.
Get up there and take a care look-see around.
I'll try and keep her ladyship occupied. - Yes, sir.
Marshal Cogburn, we are here together and it is our obligation to be on good terms.
If we avoid remarks on the Civil War, there'll be no open hostility.
Sister, why don't you step down.
We'll give the horses' backs a rest.
Get a little stretch.
Why are you called Rooster?
I never heard a man called that.
I guess in the old days,
I was cocky, kind of a struttin' bird.
- And have not changed much, as I see.
My tail feathers may droop a bit, and my wattles show, but I can still out-crow anything in the barnyard. - No doubt.
But can you outdo them?
If I couldn't, I wouldn't have much to crow about, would I?
It all depends on the barnyard.
Is Rooster your Christian name?
I was baptized Reuben.
But I ask you not to repeat that.
Why not? I漵 a name to be proud of.
Reuben led a great tribe in Israel.
Well, it hit rock bottom with me.
I'm bound to ask you this. Is your name in the Lamb's Book of Life?
Sister, are you licensed to preach?
What church do you belong to?
They let women preach in it?
I'm not an exhorter, Mr. Cogburn.
Service to others is my witness.
I'm a teacher, and a journeyman nurse.
Ayah, I can pull teeth.
I'm sorry that you don't like me.
I just don't like the way you talk.
How should I talk?
Talking of such things is my business.
It isn't that, i漵 the way you talk.
"Ayah, ayah." What is that business?
Oh, i漵 my Yankee speech that you find offensive? - I do.
I must try to remedy that.
Paul tells us that we must be all things to all men.
I'll have to learn some vulgar southern expressions.
I'll learn to be lazy and slovenly.
I'll tell you something else that Paul said:
"Let your women be silent in church."
How do you know that passage?
Judge Parker is partial to it.
You're not the only one with a Bible.
He's got a big one.
Make two or three of yours.
I漵 not the size tha漵 important, but your knowledge of its contents.
"Repent ye therefore and be converted."
You have somethin' to say from that book for every occasion.
Ayah. It was my primer. In Boston children learn to read from it.
I figured you for a Yankee, but you look more like a prairie bird.
Boney and tough.
As the only girl in a family of boys,
I grew up more strong and independent than a woman should be.
Amen, Sister. Amen.
Marshal, you're praying.
Tha漵 the first step on the road to salvation.
This ain't no church social nor revival meeting.
So don't try to convert me, Sister, or I'll end up with a empty sack.
Marshal Cogburn, a wagon and riders.
Ayah, tha漵 the wagon.
I recognize that wagon.
Just the way I figured.
You pay heed to every word I say, until this thing is over.
Naturally, Marshal.
Le漵 go.
Wolf, you to take the horses and hide them.
Signal from up there when they come.
When I yell "posse" shoot in the air, make a lot of noise.
Oon't shoot at them, you might hit the nitro.
You got that straight?
Let me show you, there.
You pull that back, point it up in the air, squeeze it.
Oo you understand?
- Yes, I think I understand.
Get up behind that broken log. - Right.
Oon't forget, that thing's loaded.
- No, no, I'll remember.
Sister, they're comin'.
Wha漵 going on? Get these logs out of the road. - I wouldn't do that.
Rooster J. Cogburn, US Marshal.
My posse has got you surrounded.
Keep your hand away from the rifles.
Anybody can say he's a Marshal.
Where's all your men?
You know who I am, you riff-raff, and what I'll do.
I'm arrestin' you all and takin' you and the wagon to Fort Smith.
Clamp your hands on your heads and get off the horses.
He ain't got nobody with him.
He's bluffin' - Hope so.
You're all talk.
We ain't afraid of you.
Next one goes into that nitro.
OK, dismount, boys.
Tha漵 more like it.
Oamn your murderin' hides.
Meet your maker.
Posse.
He's got a posse.
- Le漵 get out of here.
You alright, Sister?
Wolf, give me a hand with the logs.
- Yes, sir.
Marshal, thank God you're safe.
Wolf, that was a great shot.
- But I didn't shoot.
You shot him across that nitro?
You could have killed us all.
If I hadn't shot him, you'd be dead instead of him.
Were you trying to talk him to death?
If that worked, you wouldn't need that rifle.
I'll to say a few words over the dead.
Good or bad, they're Go飐 own.
They look like they're past carin', but go ahead.
Lord have mercy on us for what we did.
"I am the resurrection and the life," sayeth the Lord.
"He that believeth in me, though dead, yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
The Lord gave and He taketh away.
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
We brought nothing into this world and it is certain that we can take nothing out.
Unto Almighty God
I commend these souls."
Hurry it up, Sister, or we'll be joinin' them.
"For thine is the Kingdom, the power and glory forever. Amen.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes and dust to dust."
Oust to dust. Get on the wagon.
My father's murderer was not among them.
There's a Federal bank at Goldstrike.
Hawk's there settin' up the stealin'.
I'm gonna bait me a rat-trap.
And this is the cheese.
Be careful you do not end up as the cheese.
Sister, your confidence in me is inspiring.
I' gonna take this wagon to Sulfur Bottom and wait for them.
Spring my trap on my own ground.
Tha漵 not wha漵 worryin' me.
You gotta help me protect her, son.
- Yes, we'll protect her. - Good boy.
How'd a blue-blooded lady like you ever learn to shoot like that?
My first beau taught me how to shoot and equitation.
Equitation?
- Ayah. You know. Horseback riding.
I've been doin' that for 10 lustrums.
Lustrums?
50 years.
Ayah. I see.
To continue, my first beau was a dashing young man. A bit simple.
I think my manner scared him off.
He taught me to shoot well, don't you agree?
- Fair.
How old are you?
Shall we say, it has already struck midnight.
How much do you weigh?
- My word!
I don't mind scrawny women.
My first wife was nothing but bones.
I didn't know you were married.
- Yeah, she left me.
Rather like Jack Spratt and wife, only in reverse.
The Spratts had a very good arrangement, I must say.
Oo you get paid for every conversion?
- No, it doesn't work like that.
No fees?
- No fees.
And you haven't got your own money?
- Very little. - I thought that.
Are you scouting for a rich widow?
I guess you can't cook either.
'Course, tha漵 just a guess.
It appears I don't measure up.
Tha漵 a mercy.
You got more backbone than femaleness, tha漵 a fact.
Yeah, Marshal,
I would say that is a fact.
Out here in the territories, we prize a dead shot more than a lady's charms.
Then I've come to the right place.
So, men out West don't mind if a woman out-shoots, out-smarts them?
If they're quiet about it.
We value a spirited woman almost as much as a spirited horse.
Almost as much, eh?
Yes, Ma'am. Almost as much.
Not quite. But almost.
Hawk.
Hawk,
I don't think I can make it.
Leave him. We ain't got time for diggin'. Let the buzzards have him.
Marshal Cogburn, I'm curious.
What is it that you're doing?
I'm busy tryin' to follow
Uncle Sam's regulations.
That gentleman'll have his fee sheets just and correct, or he won't pay.
You're recording expenditures?
Somethin' like that. Without a deputy to help, i漵 the Oevil's own work.
Without any schoolin', you're up against it in this country, Sister.
Perhaps I can help you.
- Well, I'd be obliged.
Now, these forms are ruled with places for entries.
But your handwriting wanders into places it should not go.
I'll rub out your chicken tracks and work them over.
Wha漵 this entry? "lmportant words with blue, 2 dollars."
Tha漵 the soldier boy that tipped me on Hawk and his gang.
And he charged his government for the information?
Not exactly. I can't remember the details of every transaction.
"Travel rations for Miss Goodnight and Indian boy, Wolf, 3 dollars."
But we brought our own food.
They don't know that.
- They may be smarter than you think.
From now on, you must have approximate dates...
Alcohol on an empty stomach kills more men than outlaws' bullets.
You don't say.
My stomach ain't empty.
I漵 full of corndodgers.
Balls of hot water cornbread, made by Chen Lee, my friend.
Must be near 50 in there.
- Why are they called corndodgers?
Oodgin' corn whiskey in my innards, I guess.
You'd be better off dodging it too.
A drinking man is half a man.
You cannot give weight to the words of a drunkard.
Oon't tell me you stand in judgment of a man who pulls the cork sometimes?
I do. I漵 a weakness that indicates a lack of character.
You know more about the Lord and His Good Book than about men.
My good fortune. I know enough about men to steer clear of them.
I had no hankerin' to have one of my own.
And no desire to produce more.
Wolf.
Yes, sir?
- She's frightening.
Look.
I got me a 22 pepperbox here.
This thing shoots 5 times, sometimes all at once.
It is called a Lady's Companion.
Tha漵 what i漧l be when I'm gone.
In Fort Smith, there is a sportin' lady named Big Faye.
She was shot twice with this thing, but she dressed out at 290, so none of the bullets found their way to the vitals.
But against ordinary people it gives good service. Protect Sister with it.
Thank you, sir.
I shall guard Miss Eula with my life.
I漧l likely be the other way around.
But you take good care of her.
She is somethin'.
You wait here for Oakota.
- I could use a drink myself.
I only drink with friends.
Good shot.
You're hitting more than missing.
Them I Ain't hittin',
I ain't aimin' at.
If you're not careful, Hawk's men will hear and be looking for you.
If they ain't careful, they'll find me.
Hey, Wolf, chuck up two of them things.
Your equitation teacher do that?
Marshal Cogburn, we're ready to go.
Shooting cornbread in a meadow is not taking us anywhere.
And my father's murderers ride free.
Well, Sister,
I was just celebratin' a little.
Celebrating what?
Bein' alive, Sister.
You're shooting your own food.
Whiskey is making you silly.
Why do people wish to be silly?
Why do people wish to be sober?
Life ain't a easy game. Won't hurt to make a fool of yourself sometimes.
Yes, sometimes.
But not more often than not.
Marshal Cogburn, you're in a sorry state.
You're unsteady, untidy, rank with the sweat and spirits.
Oid you forget cleanliness and abstinence are next to Godliness?
No, I ain't forgotten a woman's naggin' and schemin'.
You figure you can take my bottle and give me soap.
Give me a Bible for my gun.
Well, it ain't gonna work.
I am what I am. Tha漵 what I am.
Wolf.
I'm fine.
I'll tell him.
You made good time. Where's the wagon?
Tha漵 why we came so soon.
We lost the wagon.
A posse of Marshals ambushed us.
They got Nose and Emmett.
Whiskey.
You'd run from a jackrabbit.
Rooster Cogburn ain't no jackrabbit.
Cogburn?
Cogburn aced ya?
Yeah.
Le漵 go.
You'll never take him, Hawk.
- Yeah?
Yeah. I rode scout for him 3 years.
And I know.
You take my money, and you wear my brand.
Got it?
Get your butts in the saddle.
We're ridin'.
We'll make camp early.
This is a likely spot.
Is it safe to stop overnight, sir?
We got to rest the horses.
Unhitch 'em.
Anyway, I ain't worried about them roadrunners.
They'll be in Goldstrike lickin' their wounds, consortin' with lewd women.
They'll start after us tomorrow.
Boy, am I thirsty.
I'm gonna fetch some water.
Orinkin' water.
Washing water I'm a stranger to, and will leave you two to draw.
Marshal Cogburn, I'm sorry if I offended you with my remarks regarding your personal habits.
I didn't realize you were such a sensitive nature.
My hide is tougher than boot leather.
But no man likes to be called high-smellin' and low-down.
Ayah, true. But unpleasant things are best said right out.
A sharp knife cuts quickest and hurts least.
And aught to be left in the scabbard.
You're a flash of lightning, Marshal.
- No. I just follow the thunder.
Well, I'll follow my own advice and retire to the stream to perform my ablution.
Her...
Her what?
Her...
Hey, Sister.
Be careful movin' out there.
Everything that grows in this country'll either bite, stab or stick you.
Will she be alright?
Any varmint that crosses her path has met i漵 match.
You, too, Marshal?
She'll never get the best of me.
You can bet on that,
Oo Indian women want to change a man too?
Yes. Miss Goodnight would be regarded as highly as a brave warrior.
No man wants to put his boots under a warrior's bed.
I heard some flappin' noise back in them trees.
Soon as we get camp set up, le漵 go huntin'. Get us a turkey.
Surprise Miss Eula with a good meal.
I would like that very much, sir.
- Good.
Here's where they waylaid us, Hawk.
There was Marshals all around.
They can't be far.
That wagon's too heavy to move fast.
And too risky to move by night.
Breed. How many?
Tracks are hard to read.
Sure as Hell ain't no posse.
What? Hear that, you stupid bastards?
He tricked you.
You listen to me, all of you.
I ain't goin' away without the nitro.
I'll kill Rooster for it, and I'll kill each one of you, you show yellow again.
Here, drink yourself some guts.
Hello. The camp.
We mus漹e hiked 10 miles tryin' to get a shot at a turk... turkey.
Bagbsy's gun pulls to the left as it fires, and the site is off a little.
But i漵 a beauty.
Son, we been outclassed.
- We got a mixed bag, owl and 'possum.
Put them in the pot.
We'll have wilderness stew.
You shot 'em, skin 'em.
Oid you ever come up against
Jesse James or Billy the Kid?
Naw, I never ran into them fellows.
Oid I ever tell how Lucky Ned Pepper and his gang chased me?
No. I'd like to hear about it.
- Ayah. Tell us.
That was somethin'.
They chased me till I got tired of it, then I just whirled my horse, Bo, around, took the reins in my teeth and rid right at them villains.
I was shootin' my pistol with one hand and my Winchester with the other.
Never took aim.
Just snap-shot and got 'em all.
Marshal, are you sure you're not stretching the blanket a bit?
I was thinkin' you'd figure that way.
So I told it gospel.
Proof is, I'm here, their dead.
One sad thing that day.
Lost old Bo.
Marshal, would you like more to eat?
Naw, I don't think so.
I'm full, but one thing I could stand:
I'd pay 3 dollars for a pickled buffalo tongue.
I'd have thought you'd had enough pickled tongue for one day.
No. But I've had enough tongue tha漵 barbed and indigestible.
I know. It often is.
Well, Sister, how do you stand on the sin of tobacco?
Well, I know of no passage to prove it, but I'm certain that the Good Lord smokes fine cigars.
Hallelujah.
Marshal, is your eye bothering you?
I could sooth it with a poultice.
No, thanks, Ma'am. I漵 past help.
- Was it a hunting accident, Marshal?
You might say that. Huntin' Yankees.
I lost it in the war, riding with
Bill Anderson and Captain Quantrill.
Times have sure changed.
Now I'm workin' for a damned Yankee.
But you're still hunting, sir.
I guess I like Marshalin' better'n anything I've done since the war.
I like buffalo huntin', but them big shaggies is almost gone.
Oamn shame.
I was skinnin' buffalo at Yellow Horse Creek, Texas.
Pay was great, but I couldn't stand that open country.
I'll bet there weren't
6 trees between there and Canada.
I love the freedom of the open prairies. You love your freedom too.
Yeah, yeah. I went off it once.
But my wife and I are travelin' different roads now.
She didn't like my friends, she didn't like me when I was myself.
My drinkin' picked up, she got a bellyful of it and left.
Now I'm livin' happily with my cat, General Sterling Price, and my friend Chen Lee, the Chinaman. They let a man be.
Be what, Marshal?
Be his self. He don't have to change.
But change is progress. You're not too old to change. Life is a school.
Well, teacher, don't start pressin' your dress for my graduation.
'Cause I intend to stay in my own low class, indefinitely.
May I have more 'possum stew?
- Opossum. An American marsupial.
Wolf, give me some of that owl meat.
It might make me smart.
A wise old owl sat on an oak, the more he heard, the less he spoke.
The less he spoke, the more he heard.
Now, wasn't that a wise old bird.
I guess there's a lesson in that for me. For us both.
How many miles did we ride today? - About 20.
It feels like more than that.
- Wait a minute. Maybe I can help.
That feels good.
I'll bet your backside hurts worse than anything.
Ayah, well, we can't do anything about that.
Well, I reckon not.
Better.
The layin' on of the hands.
How do you happen to know that?
What I know might surprise you, Sister.
Nothing about you would surprise me.
Just a minute, Sister,
I'll put my lariat around your bed, then the night crawlers and snakes will respect it.
Is it true, that they won't crawl over a rope?
I ain't gonna say i漵 true or it ain't true. But i漵 comfortin'.
Thank you, Reuben.
The Good Book says, "Let not the sun go down on thy wrath."
I'm glad it didn't.
Goodnight, Sister.
Goodnight, Reuben.
- Wolf, give me a hand.
Goodnight, Ma'am.
- Goodnight, Wolf.
This Gatling gun is a little heavy.
Set this up for your protection, in case them cut-throats do come.
We'll still have an advantage.
A little chilly. I guess we'd better stand guard tonight over there across the creek.
You take the first watch, and I'll spell you around midnight.
You got the pepperbox?
- Right here.
Oon't use it unless you have to.
Any trouble, give that coyote howl and high-tail it back here to camp.
That big flat rock on the side is a good place for a look-out.
Sir?
- Yeah?
Has there ever been an Indian Marshal?
Not that I heard tell of.
- Tha漵 what I'd like to be.
A man like you.
You're not aimin' your sites very high, son.
But if you'd like to follow in my tracks, I'd be proud to help you.
Thank you, sir.
Goodnight, son.
- Goodnight, sir.
Reuben.
Have you seen an enlarged picture of a drunkar飐 liver?
Oamnation.
Even in their sleep?
Goodnight, Miss Goodnight.
Goodnight, Reuben.
Bring him.
Spread out.
Marshal.
Stay down.
Where are ya, Wolf?
I got him, Rooster.
That you, Hawk?
- You know it is.
You're interested in the wagon?
- You let that boy go.
Stay down.
I will let him go, when you give me back that wagon.
Breed, you there?
- I'm here, Rooster.
You alright? - I'm alright.
You're the one with a little trouble.
I want that wagon.
You ain't goin' nowhere with it.
Give it to me, or the Indian boy dies.
Then I'll blow up this wagon.
And hunt down every one of you and cut you throat to throat.
Alright, I'll trade that damn wagon for the boy, if he ain't harmed.
Leroy, show 'em the bait.
When they lower their guns, rush 'em. Shoot to kill.
Alright, bring him across.
We'll stand aside.
Marshal, i漵 a trick.
They're gonna kill you.
Hold your fire.
Nice work, boy.
Here, Sister, give Wolf the rifle.
You may have the boy now, but nobody moves till we get wha漵 ours.
I got a pretty good position here, and some mean deputies.
You're a liar, Rooster.
You ain't got no posse.
Well, I got a Gatling gun.
And I got it set up.
You've got 2 minutes to run, or I'll fill you full of holes like a sieve.
You ain't got the know-how to use that gun.
Oeputy, show 'em.
Ain't that the way it works, Hawk?
Now, high-tail it before I forget my promise to bring you in alive.
That was good, Rooster.
But the odds will change at sun-up.
Spread out. When he moves it in the morning, we'll make our play.
Wolf, did you see their horses?
- Yes, sir, up there.
Can you get back up there and spook 'em? - I can, sir. - Good.
You're risking the boy's life.
I'm countin' on your relationship with the Lord. Can you hitch a team?
Yes, I can.
I'll get there attention over there.
Hitch the team and saddle the horses.
Yes.
Hawk, you there?
- Ready to deal, Rooster?
I'll give you a last chance to give yourself up.
Wait till daylight.
We'll see who's ready to give up.
I'll get you a fair trial and a fine hanging.
Might even get you life at the Federal House in Oetroit.
They'll teach you to read and write.
'Course the rest ain't so good.
Get the horses.
Good work, Wolf.
You bought us some time.
Wolf, gimme a hand.
You folks runnin' from somethin' or to somethin'? - Both.
Are you goin' across?
- We aim to use your raft.
10 cents for a horse and rider, wagon
1 dollar, 50 cents for extra weight.
Show of money before passage.
I'm Rooster J. Cogburn,
Federal Marshal.
The men I'm stalking are hot on my tail and I'm gonna need help.
Give this woman and boy sanctuary.
If I wanted women and children
I'd have my own.
They ain't nothin' but trouble.
Oon't saddle me with your discards.
You ain't very hospitable.
I ain't got an ounce of goodwill.
I hate everybody.
I'm a cantankerous old man and I know it.
I like myself better'n anyone else.
Tha漵 why I took this job.
Watch that nitro.
- What?
Tell me if you want to cross.
I can't stay out in this heat.
The sun is fryin' my brains.
I can only get this stuff down to Sulfur Bottom by river.
What do I do with you two?
Too risky to leave you here.
Maybe I can land you someplace before the shootin' starts.
Old man?
- Are you goin' across?
No.
We're goin' down river.
We're loanin' the raft.
That ain't loanin', tha漵 stealin'.
Am I gonna have trouble? - Not a bit, as long as you got that.
I'm securin' this for the law.
I ain't got much use for the law.
It ain't got use for me, neither.
Is there a law says you can't help us?
- Anything to get you out of here.
There you are.
Oo you know anything about rafts?
There's rough water down river.
I can ride. Can't be much different.
You ain't no sailor. I can see that.
Water is like a woman:
Sly and fickle.
You gotta watch it every minute.
You a sailor? - I was once.
Shanghai McCoy's my name.
Been around the Horn, sailed the 7 seas, seen everything, done everything, tha漵 how I know people are rotten.
I've seen 'em all.
You're wrong, old man.
We're made in Go飐 image, and goodness is in us. Even in you.
Amazin'!
I never took you for a Bible-thumper.
Hold it. She is what she is
'cause she wants to be.
Tha漵 the way you take her. Like me.
You're wastin' your time preachin'.
You too, Sister.
I'm a ship that can't be salvaged.
- "With God, all things are possible."
You're shippin' out a strange crew, captain.
I'll match their mettle against most.
- I'm glad i漵 your ship, not mine.
Women can no more keep their mouths shut than a yellow-tailed catfish.
Got to agree with you there.
We'll ride ahead and take 'em at the narrows. Breed.
You and Luke river-trail 'em.
Join us at the narrows, just ahead of 'em.
Hold your course.
Keep the rudder amidships when you hit that white water.
Nobody ever shot them rapids on a raft before.
You just take care of my horses,
Commodore. I'll be back for 'em.
Oon't crack up my vessel on them rocks, you hear me?
I漵 so lovely here.
I wish we could sail right on down to the sea.
Right now, Webber Falls would be more to my liking.
We'll get there tomorrow.
With the Good Lor飐 help.
Would you really have killed those men with the Gatling gun?
They believed I would. In a pinch a convincin' lie's as good as a posse.
Tell me more about the outlaws and how you bested them.
If you gentlemen will excuse me,
I'll go have a little sleep.
I've had enough of your daring-do for one day.
You ever heard of Abilene Town?
- No.
I was there lookin' for a bunco-steerer named 21-Jewel Slim.
That Abilene is the worst place
I have ever saw.
It is a sink of crime.
I was standin' on Horse Thief Corner when Prairie Rose came down the street with nothin' on but her six-guns.
She was stark naked and painted... - Wolf!
Stop poling and get some rest.
You've got to spell Marshal Cogburn tonight. - Yes, Ma'am.
What color was she painted, Reuben?
Breed, ain't no love lost between you and Hawk, or him and me.
If you was willing to quit him now and join up with me.
I think we could take the raft and be rich men instead of dead ones.
You game?
Maybe.
Wha漵 your plan?
Come on, I'll show you.
We lay the rope under the water, so they don't see it.
When they get up to it, i漧l stretch tight and stop 'em.
Old Rooster, he'll want to cut the rope, or stretch it up and float the raft underneath.
Tha漵 when I get a good shot at him, without a chance of blowing the nitro.
You kill the other two.
We'll land the cargo later.
What makes you think this will work?
- I漧l work, partner.
Now what?
Take this tiller, Wolf.
Wha漵 holdin' us up?
Rooster, cut it loose.
Breed?
- Yeah. Saved my life once.
Now we're even.
- Grateful to you.
Hawk's waitin' for you down river.
Can't help you there.
Well, we'll be ready for him.
Someone's comin'.
I漵 me, Hawk.
What the Hell you doin' here?
Where's Luke?
Oead. We shot it out with Rooster.
Luke lost.
I said track him, not take him.
What happened? - Tried to stop the raft with a rope across the river.
Rooster cut it and got away.
We gun-fought him, but...
Hell, Hawk, he's just too good for us.
Let me see your gun.
You don't want my gun.
Oh, yes I do.
You know,
Breed here, he gun-fought old Rooster with just one bullet.
You're a liar, Breed.
I owed him one.
I wish this thing had a little more giddy-up to it.
I picked blackberries, Reuben.
Would you like some?
No, not for me. I have to be careful.
I can't just eat anything. Get colic.
'Course, my mouth is slickerin' for one thing:
Chen Lee's corn bread, fried in a big ladle of coon meat grease.
Yes. Well, when we get to Fort Smith,
I'd like to get Mr. Lee's recipe.
Will we get back, Reuben?
The odds are the same.
They ain't in our favor.
When you drop us off at Webber's Falls, and go after them, you will be careful, won't you?
Wolf and I care about you, very much.
Well, Ma'am...
I don't know much about thoroughbreds, horses or women.
Them that I did know,
I never liked.
They're too nervous and spooky.
They scare me.
But you're one high-bred filly that don't.
I don't know what you're talkin' about half the time, but that don't matter.
Bein' around you pleases me.
Those are the nicest words ever said to me. Thank you, Reuben.
Wolf,
I'll spell ya.
We got you now, Rooster.
Throw your guns in the water, pull ashore, keep your hands high.
And don't try nothin', or you're dead.
Tha漵 a rattlesnake's warnin', Hawk.
You squat-assassin.
Your schemin' ain't gonna help now.
Oon't you rely on it,
Hawk. Oon't rely on it.
Tha漧l keep their heads down.
There's one.
Oon't hit the nitro.
Shoot wide. Force 'em into the bank.
Them rapids'll get him now.
No. I will.
The Lord is with us.
So's that current.
If He owes you any favors, now's the time to collect.
Get out of the way, Wolf.
Alright, brace yourself.
God help us. - If He does,
I'll give up drinkin'.
The gun.
It went over, we've lost the gun.
- What the Hell can I do about it?
Watch it there, Sister.
Hold tight.
Oh, no!
You alright, Sister?
- I don't know.
Am I alright?
How did we do it?
Your friend mus漹e been on the job.
I guess he mus漹e.
My God!
Marshal, look!
I漵 a showdown.
- We did the best we could.
Sister, I've finished every fight standin' up.
We'll finish this one, maybe not standing up, but we'll finish it.
Wolf, get those lines loose.
Have a care with that nitro.
Easy does it.
Ease them boxes into the water.
Remember, i漵 nitroglycerin.
Well, we'll see.
They never made it, Hawk.
Yeah, but the nitro did.
Now.
Hold your fire
Marshal Cogburn is injured and dying.
Take your dynamite, but give us safe passage.
Sure, lady, we'll do that.
We'll just take our load, then we'll send you and your hero on.
Straight to Hell. Come on.
Now, Reuben.
Payday. Come and get it, boys.
Payday.
Well, we won the battle, but I lost my job.
Maybe not.
You see, Judge, the Lord could have struck down the Midianites and Amalekites easily.
But He didn't do that.
He raised up Gideon to smite them.
An ordinary man like the Marshal.
I漵 in the Book of Judges, Judge.
- I know where it is, Madam.
Very ingenious defense.
It takes one's breath away.
But I do not believe the Lord has raised up Gideon at Fort Smith. No.
If he's raised up anything,
I fear i漵 Rooster.
A willful, strutting old bird, who paid no attention to the US law.
But he did. I killed that criminal trash. Not Marshal Cogburn.
He wanted him hung, according to law, but I couldn't do that. - Silence.
My father's honor was at stake.
Will you take Reuben's word, or mine?
Reuben?
Well, in view of my past experience, with Reuben, I'll take yours.
Get back on the rails.
This man may pull a cork now and then, but he's as straight as a string.
He's the best Marshal you have, worth more than you pay. - Reuben.
You are reinstated, and this court is recessed and dismissed.
Reinstated.
Congratulations, Marshal.
Oamn Chinaman.
One thing I'd like to get straight.
We both know the Lord brands lyin' a sin.
Oo you think He'll smile on you after them whoppers you told?
"And if thy words stray from truth for the good of Go飐 own, if thy intent be pure, thou shalt not be judged sinful."
Beautiful quotation.
What book? What chapter?
I confess, Reuben, it is my invention.
I just made it up.
Hallelujah and jubilee!
That is one quotation I'll remember.
And will you remember us, too?
Longer than that quotation, Miss Eula.
We found 5 families who will homestead at Fort Ruby and help us re-settle it.
Will you see us off at Texas Road?
We join the wagon train there.
I will consider it a privilege, Ma'am.
Well, Ma'am, this is where our trails part.
Maybe they'll cross again.
Tha漵 something I'd like to drink to.
After that vow you took on the river?
- "When a soul needs reviving, thou shalt reach for help."
Book and chapter?
- Rooster Cogburn, 1880.
Will you join me, Ma'am?
Maybe I will try just a little sip.
To someday.
Someday.
Goodbye, Marshal.
Goodbye, son.
Goodbye, Reuben.
Watch your drinkin', Ma'am.
If you ever need of a one-eyed peace officer.
Reuben, I have to say it:
Living with you has been an adventure any woman would relish for all time.
I look at you, with your burnt-out face, your big belly, your bear-like paws and shining eyes.
You're a credit to the male sex and I'm proud you're my friend.
Oamned if she didn't get the last word in again. Well...
Come on, boys!
The way you're lollygagging around here with them picks and them shovels...
...you'd think it was 120°...
It cant' be more than 114.
Dock that Chink a day's pay for napping on the job.
Now, come on, boys, where's your spirit? I don't hear no singing.
When you were slaves, you sang like birds.
Go on. How about a good old nigger work song?
"I get no kick from champagne.
"Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all.
"So tell me why should it be true...
"... that I get a belt out of you?
"Some get a kick from cocaine. "
What the hell is that shit?
I meant a song. A real song.
Something like...
"Swing low, sweet chariot... "
Swing low? Sweet chariot?
Don't know that one, huh?
How about "De Camp Town Ladies"?
"De Camp Town Ladies"?
Ah, you know.
"De Camp Town Ladies sing this song, doo-dah, doo-dah.
"De Camp Town race track five miles long, all the doo-dah day!
"Gonna run all night, gonna run all day.
"Bet my money on the bobtailed nag, somebody bet on the bay!"
What in the wide, wide world of sports is going on here?
I hired you people to try to get a little track laid...
...not to jump around like a bunch of Kansas City faggots!
Sorry, Mr. Taggart. I, I guess we kind of got caught up.
Dummy, the surveyors say they may have run into some quicksand up ahead.
Better check it out.
Okay, I'll send down a team of horses to check out the ground.
Horses! We can't afford to lose any horses, you dummy!
Send over a couple of niggers.
You and you.
Sir, he specifically requested two niggers...
...but to tell a family secret, my grandmother was Dutch.
Get on that hand car and take it down to the end of that line!
Just trying to help you out.
I didn't know your grandma was Dutch!
"Oh, de Camp Town Ladies sing this song, doo-dah, doo-dah.
"Camp Town race track five miles long, oh, doo-dah day.
"Going to run all night, going to run all day.
"I waged my money on the bobtail nag, somebody bet on the bay!"
Am I wrong...
...or is the world rising?
I don't know, but whatever it is, I hate it.
Let me ask you something.
What is it that's not exactly water, and it's not exactly earth?
Quicksand!
Oh, shit, quicksand!
Goddang, now we are in trouble!
They're in trouble!
Get your rope there.
Get over there quick.
Dang, that was lucky.
Doggone near lost a $400 hand cart.
Yeah, we can take it right off to the, just a little bit to the left of that hill.
But we're going to die, Bart.
They're going to leave us here to die!
Take it easy, Charlie.
My foot is on the rail.
Then maybe down that canyon.
I think it's pretty level off there.
We can't swing back to the right
'cause of that hill there.
That looks like the way we'll have to go from here.
Yes, we'll put her right down through there over that ridge.
Well, boys, the break is over.
Don't just lay there getting a suntan.
Won't do you any good, anyhow!
Take that shovel and put her to some good use!
What?
Don't do that now!
I have to.
Send a wire to the main office and tell them I said... OW!
Send wire, main office, tell them I said, "Ow". Gotcha.
And right here, Mr. Lamarr, is where we ran into quicksand.
Quicksand. Splendid.
And so the railroad has got to go through Rock Ridge.
Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge. Splendid.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge.
Be still, Taggart. Be still.
My mind is aglow with whirling, transient nodes of thought...
...careening through a cosmic vapor of invention.
Ditto!
Ditto? Ditto, you provincial putz!
I'm sorry, sir.
A plan. We need a plan.
What in the hell was that?
We can't hear ourselves think!
Sorry, your Worship, but I've got two men home sick with the flu...
...and it's utter chaos down here.
I'll try to keep it as quiet as possible.
But as you can see...
...this one is a doozey.
Yes, the Doctor Gillespie killings.
Well, do your best.
Now, let's see. Where were we?
Rock Ridge.
Yes, when that railroad goes through Rock Ridge...
...that land will be worth millions, and I want it!
I want that land so badly,
I can taste it.
There must be a way.
Clumsy fool!
Wait a minute! There might be a legal precedent.
Of course! Land-snatching!
Land. La-land. "See 'Snatch'."
Haley vs. United States.
Haley, seven. United States, nothing.
You see, it can be done.
It can be done.
Unfortunately, there is one thing that stands between me and that property.
The rightful owners.
There must be some way of scaring them off, driving them out.
Getting rid of every human being alive in that...
It's down the hall and to the left.
I've got it!
What? What?
I know how we can run everybody out of Rock Ridge.
We'll kill the first-born male child in every household!
Too Jewish.
We'll work up a Number Six on them!
I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that one.
That's where we go riding into town...
...and a-whapping and a-whooping every living thing...
...that moves within an inch of its life!
Except the women folks, of course.
You spare the women?
No, we rape the shit out of them at the Number Six dance later on!
That's marvelous! That's so creative!
Why, Taggart, you've been hurt!
That uppity nigger hit me on the head with a shovel.
I'd sure appreciate it, sir, if you could find it in your heart...
...to hang him up by his neck until he was dead.
Got him locked up downstairs.
Consider it done, stout fellow.
I've got a special.
When can you work him in?
I couldn't possibly fit him in until Monday, sir. I'm booked solid.
Monday. Splendid.
Thank you, sir.
And don't you worry.
We'll make Rock Ridge think it's a chicken...
...that got caught in a tractor's nuts!
It's all right, Taggart. Just a man and a horse being hung out there.
"There was a peaceful town called Rock Ridge,
"... where people lived in harmony.
"They never had no kind of trouble.
"There was no hint of misery.
"The town saloon was always lively...
"... but never nasty or obscene.
"Behind the bar stood Anal Johnson.
"He always kept things nice and clean!
"And all at once the trouble started.
"A pack of murderers and thieves...
"... like swarms of locusts they descended...
"... their aim to make the townsfolk flee. "
Well, that's the end of this suit!
Have you ever seen such cruelty?
"Now is a time of great decision.
"Are we to stay or up and quit?
"There's no avoiding this conclusion.
"Our town is turning into shit!"
Well, I don't have to tell you good folks...
...what has been happening here in our beloved town.
Sheriff murdered, crops burned...
...stores looted, people stampeded...
...and cattle raped!
Now the time has come to act.
And act fast!
I'm leaving.
You get back here, you old pious, candy-ass sidewinder!
There ain't no way that nobody is going to leave this town!
Hell, I was born here and I was raised here...
...and goddamn it,
I'm going to die here!
And no sidewinder, bushwhacking, hornswoggling...
...cracker croaker, is going to ruin my biscuit-cutter!
Now who can argue with that?
I think we're all indebted to Gabby Johnson...
...for clearly stating what needed to be said.
I'm particularly glad that these lovely children...
...were here today to hear that speech.
Not only was it authentic frontier gibberish...
...it expressed a courage little seen in this day and age!
What are we made of?
Our fathers came across the prairie...
...fought Indians, fought drought, fought locusts, fought Dix!
Remember when Richard Dix came in here and tried to take over this town?
Well, we didn't give up then...
...and by gum, we're not going to give up now!
Olson Johnson is right!
What kind of people are we, anyhow?
I say we stay and fight it out!
Dr. Samuel Johnson is right about
Olson Johnson's being right.
And I'm not giving up my ice cream parlor...
...that I built with these two hands for nothing or nobody!
Howard Johnson is right!
Well, if we're going to stay, and
I think it's a big mistake...
...we're going to need a new sheriff.
Now, who is it going to be?
Why don't we wire the governor to send us a sheriff?
Why should we get our own men killed?
Howard Johnson is right.
We'll wire the governor.
Then let us pray for the deliverance of our new sheriff.
Will the congregation please rise?
I shall now read from the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke...
...and duck!
We've got to do something at once!
Governor, may I disturb you for a moment, sir?
If you will just sign this, governor.
Right here.
Yes, what the hell is it?
Well, under the provisions of this bill...
...we would snatch 200,000 acres of Indian territory...
...which we have deemed unsafe for their use at this time.
They're such children.
200,000 acres!
200,000 acres!
What will it cost, man?
What will it cost?
A box of these.
Are you crazy? They'll never go for it, and then again they might.
The little red devils, they love toys. May I try one?
These things are defective.
Right as usual, sir.
Show-off!
Just sign this, sir. Right here.
Okay, give us a hand here.
Work, work, work.
Hello, boys, have a good night's rest?
I missed you.
Just one more bill for you to sign, sir.
What is this?
This is the bill that will convert the State Hospital for the Insane...
...into the William J. Le Petomane
Memorial Gambling Casino for the Insane.
Gentlemen, this...
...this bill will be a giant step forward...
...in the treatment of the insane gambler.
Yes, bravo! Beautiful.
Thank you, Hedy. Thank you.
It's not Hedy. It's Hedley.
Hedley Lamarr.
What the hell are you worried about?
This is 1874.
You'll be able to sue her.
All right, help me in with this.
Just, ah, think of your secretary.
Ah, that was a very good suggestion.
Okay, is that it? Anything else?
Just this urgent telegram from Rock Ridge.
It arrived last Friday.
Read it, read it.
"Sheriff murdered. Church meeting bombed. Reign of terror must cease.
"Send new sheriff immediately. "
Holy underwear!
Sheriff murdered. Innocent women and children blown to bits!
We've got to protect our phony-baloney jobs, gentlemen.
We must do something about this immediately, immediately, immediately!
I didn't get a "hrumph" out of that guy!
Give the governor a "hrumph. "
You watch your ass.
Gentlemen, please, rest your sphincters.
Well put.
As Attorney General, I can assure you...
...that a suitable sheriff will be found to restore the peace in Rock Ridge.
Meeting is adjourned.
Oh, I am sorry, sir. I didn't mean to overstep my bounds. You say that.
What?
- Meeting is adjourned.
- It is?
No. You say that, governor.
- What?
- Meeting is adjourned.
It is?
Here, play around with this for a while.
They are sweeping the country.
Why don't you give these out to some of the boys...
...in lieu of pay? Here you go.
And one for Miss Stein, my beloved secretary.
Play with these, boys, in lieu of the other things.
This friggin' thing is warped.
Why do I always get a warped one?
A sheriff! But law and order is the last thing I want.
Wait a minute. Maybe I could turn this thing to my advantage.
If I could find a sheriff who so offends the citizens of Rock Ridge...
...that his very appearance would drive them out of town...
But where would I find such a man?
Why am I asking you?
Welcome to Hanging House.
Not to worry...
...everyone is equal in my eye.
Oh, not my ear!
Governor!
Official business, sir.
Is it important?
It's very crucial.
Be with you in a minute.
Throw something on and stay in that position.
Forgive me, I was just, ah, walking the parapet, taking a look around.
What can I do for you?
Governor, as per your instructions...
...I'd like you to meet the new sheriff of Rock Ridge.
I'd be delighted... Wow!
I've got to talk to you. Come here.
Have you gone berserk?
Can't you see that man is a nig...
Wrong person. Forgive me.
No offense intended.
Have you gone berserk?
Can't you see that man is a nig?
Don't worry, sir.
Now, Hedley, I've always trusted your judgment before...
...but haven't you taken a giant leap away from your good senses?
Please, don't fly off the handle, sir.
I'm about to make you an historic figure.
Maybe even get you a cabinet post.
A cabinet post!
Did you say that?
Wonderful!
Yes, the first man ever to appoint a black sheriff! Just think, sir...
...Washington, Jefferson...
...Lincoln.
Le Petomane!
Sir, you have the seeds of greatness in you.
Nurse them, caress them, pour water on them.
Don't short-change yourself, sir.
It will never work.
They'll kill him dead in one day!
One day is all we'll need to secure your name in the annals of Western history.
And to get for you a nomination for, dare I say...?
Dare, dare!
The Presidency!
Hail to the Chief!
Hail to the Chief!
"Four score and seven years ago...
"... our forefathers brought forth on this... "
Are you coming back?
In a moment, dear.
Gentlemen, affairs of state must take precedent over the affairs of state.
Yes, of course, sir, we understand.
Will you make all the arrangements?
I will make all the arrangements.
Especially the funeral.
Good luck, good luck, boys.
Wonderful working with you. Good luck!
Hurry up, get those flags up.
He'll be here soon.
I just got a telegram from the governor's office.
The sheriff will be here at noon!
Noon! I'd better rehearse my speech!
"As Honorary Chairman of the Welcoming Committee...
"... it is my privilege to extend to you a laurel and hearty handshake!"
Wonderful!
Excellent!
Can you see him yet?
The sheriff is coming!
Ring out the church bell!
Hey, the sheriff is a n...
What did he say?
The sheriff is near!
No, no, dag blame it, gol darn it, the sheriff is a n...
As Chairman of the
Welcoming Committee...
...it is my privilege to extend a laurel and hearty handshake to our new...
...nigger.
Excuse me while I whip this out.
"By the power vested in me by...
"... the Honorable
William J. Le Petomane...
"... I hereby assume the duties...
"... of the Office of Sheriff in and for the Township of Rock Ridge. "
Gentlemen, let us not allow anger to rule the day.
As your spiritual leader,
I implore you...
...to pay heed to this good book and what it has to say.
Son, you're on your own!
Hold it!
The next man makes a move, the nigger gets it!
Hold it, men. He's not bluffing.
Listen to him, men.
He's just crazy enough to do it.
Drop it! Or I swear I'll blow this nigger's head all over this town!
Oh, Lordy, Lord, he's desperate!
Do what he say! Do what he say!
Isn't anybody going to help that poor man?
Hush, Harriet. That's a sure way to get him killed.
Help me, help me...
...somebody help me!
Shut up!
Oh, baby, you are so talented.
And they are so dumb!
Goddamn it!
I said, "Order"!
You know, Nietzsche says,
"Out of chaos comes order. "
Oh, blow it out your ass, Howard!
Now everyone be quiet...
...whilst we listen to Harriet van
Johnson, our esteemed schoolmarm...
...as she reads a telegram that she herself has composed to the governor...
...expressing our feelings about the new sheriff.
"To the Honorable William J.
Le Petomane, Governor. "
Louder! Speak up! We can't hear you!
I'm not used to public speaking.
"We, the white, God-fearing citizens of Rock Ridge...
"... wish to express our extreme displeasure...
"... with your choice of sheriff.
"Please remove him immediately.
"The fact that you have sent him here... "
"... just goes to prove that you are the leading asshole in the state. "
The drunk in number two must be awake.
Are we awake?
We're not sure.
Are we black?
Yes, we are.
Then we're awake.
But we're very puzzled.
I think I better straighten myself out.
Need any help?
All I can get.
That's okay. Sit down over here.
Hey, maybe you should eat something first.
No, thanks. Food makes me sick.
A man drinks like that and doesn't eat, he is going to die.
When?
What's your name?
Well, my name is Jim, but most people call me...
...Jim.
Okay, Jim, since you are my guest and I am your host...
...what is your pleasure?
What do you like to do?
Oh, I don't know. Play chess...
...screw.
Well, let's play chess.
Checkmate.
Checkmate.
Why, you devious son-of-a-bitch!
Happy days!
Man, why do you do that to yourself?
Oh, you don't really want to know that.
I do, I do!
Well, if you must pry.
I must, I must!
I don't know if you ever heard of me before, but...
...I used to be called the Waco Kid.
The Waco Kid. He had the fastest hands in the West!
In the world!
Well, if you're the Kid, then show me something.
Maybe a couple of years ago I could have shown you something, but today...
...look at that.
Steady as a rock.
Yes, but I shoot with this hand.
See, I knew you weren't the Waco Kid.
You were just pulling my lariat.
See that king?
Put your hands on both sides of it.
Now when I say, "go," you try to grab it first.
Man, that's no contest.
You're a mile away.
Anyway, when you hear the word
"go," you just try to grab it.
Ready?
You looking for this?
Well, raise my rent!
You are the Kid!
Was. Yeah, I was the Kid.
What happened?
Well, it got so that every piss-ant prairie punk...
...who thought he could shoot a gun...
...would ride into town to try out the Waco Kid.
I must have killed more men than Cecil B. DeMille.
It got pretty gritty.
I started to hear the word "draw" in my sleep.
Then one day...
...I was just walking down the street and I heard a voice behind me say...
..."Reach for it, mister!"
I spun around.
And there I was face to face...
...with a 6-year-old kid!
Well, I just threw my guns down and walked away.
The little bastard shot me in the ass!
So I limped to the nearest saloon, crawled inside a whiskey bottle...
...and I've been there ever since.
Have a drink.
Anyway, that's all ancient history.
Now you tell me your story.
What's a dazzling urbanite like you doing in a rustic setting like this?
If you really must pry.
I must, I must!
Well, back in '56...
...my folks and I were part of this long wagon train...
...moving West.
Well, not exactly part of it.
You might say we were bringing up the rear, when suddenly,
...from out of the West, came the entire Sioux Nation!
And let me tell you, baby, they were open for business!
Naturally, the white folks didn't let us travel in their circle...
...so we made our own.
Shvartzes?
Luzem gayen!
Cop a walk. It's all right.
Thank you.
Abi gezunt. Take off.
They're darker than us!
And the rest is history.
Impressed?
Always like to keep my audience riveted.
How about some more beans,
Mr. Taggart?
I'd say you've had enough!
I understand there's a new sheriff in town. Who wants to kill him?
Why don't we give him to Mongo?
Holy shit, that's too cruel!
I'll be danged! That is a unique idea!
Down, boy, down, boy, down, Mongo!
Hey, it's me. Taggart.
Here, smell. Smell.
That's a good Mongo.
Hey, how about it? How would you like to mutilate that new sheriff?
Have a cigar.
Oh, by the way,
I got a note this morning.
From who?
Well, I'm not sure.
It was addressed to the Deputy Spade.
Well, once I establish myself in this town...
...Deputy Spade might turn out to be a groovy position.
Listen, Bart,
I want you to do me a favor.
I don't want you going out there this morning.
You can't win these people over, no matter what you do.
They're just not going to accept you.
I'm glad those fingers ain't loaded!
Just like old times.
Like I told you, once you establish yourself, they've got to accept you.
Catch you later.
Good luck.
Ah, good morning, ma'am.
And isn't it a lovely morning?
Up yours, nigger!
What did you expect?
"Welcome, sonny. "
"Make yourself at home. "
"Marry my daughter. " You've got to remember these are just simple farmers.
These are people of the land.
The common clay of the new West.
You know.
Morons!
What the hell is that?
Mongo! Santa María!
I believe in it.
And if any one of you...
...friends and neighbors, kind of gather around and...
Holy shit!
And they say that now in Paris,
France, even as we speak...
...Louis Pasteur has devised a new vaccine...
...that will obliterate anthrax once and for all.
Hey, you can't park that animal over there!
It's illegal.
Think of it, gentlemen. Hoof-and- mouth disease a thing of the past!
Never mind that shit, here comes Mongo!
I don't know what it is.
Sheriff, Mongo's back!
He's breaking up the whole town!
You've got to help us, please!
Did you hear that? Now it's "please. "
This morning I couldn't get the time of day. Who is this Mongo, anyway?
Well, Mongo ain't exactly a "who. "
He's more of a "what. "
What he said.
Well, I don't know...
Oh, thank you very much!
The fool's going to...
I mean, the sheriff's going to do it.
No, no, don't do that! If you shoot him, you'll just make him mad.
Candygram for Mongo!
Me, Mongo.
Sign, please.
Mongo like candy.
A little further down, to the right.
I thought sure that Mongo would mash him up...
...into little bitty sheriff meatballs.
I just don't understand it.
Be still, Taggart.
My mind is a raging torrent...
...flooded with rivulets of thought...
...cascading into a waterfall of creative alternatives.
Gol darn it, Mr. Lamarr...
...you use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.
Wait a minute, that's it!
And it will work!
You bet it will! What will work?
Elementary, cactus-head!
The beast has failed.
And when the beast fails, it's time to call in beauty.
Beauty?
She's never failed me before.
She'll turn him into jelly!
She'll bring him to his knees!
Where's my froggie?
Where's my froggie?
I don't know.
I didn't see it when I came in.
Damn your eyes, look for it!
Oh, there it is.
That was a close one! Daddy loves
Froggie. Froggie love Daddy?
I don't know how you did it.
He was nothing.
The bitch was inventing the candygram.
They probably won't give me credit for it.
Good evening, sheriff.
Sorry about the "Up yours, nigger. "
I hope this apple pie will in some small way say thank you for your...
...ingenuity and courage in defeating that horrible Mongo.
Thank you. Much obliged.
Good night.
Of course, you'll have the good taste not to mention that I spoke to you.
I'm rapidly becoming a big underground success in this town.
See, in another 25 years you'll be able to shake their hands in broad daylight.
Well, I'm not going to hold my breath for it.
Come on, I don't want to be late.
Lili von Shtupp is opening tonight.
Lili von who?
Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome.
Come on in.
It's Hedley. For you, my dear.
Oh, how ordinary.
Oh, Lili, Lili, Lili, legs, Lili, Lili!
I can't find the words to truly express my joy...
...at the rekindling of our association.
Bullshit, what's the job?
I love it when you talk dirty.
Come on, Lamarr, let's get down to bwass tacks.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to seduce and abandon the sheriff of Rock Ridge.
You think you can do it?
Is Bismark a hewwing?
Oh, Lili, you're magnificent! Kiss me!
And now, folks, the gal you've all been waiting for...
...the Bavarian Bombshell herself!
Let's hear it for Lili von Shtupp!
"Here I stand, the goddess of desire...
"... set men on fire.
I have this power.
"Morning, noon and night, it's drink and dancing...
"... some quick romancing, and then a shower.
"Stage door Johnnies constantly surround me...
"... they always hound me with one request.
"Who can satisfy their lustful habit?
"I'm not a rabbit. I need some rest.
"I'm tired...
"... sick and tired of love...
"I've had my fill of love...
"... from below and above.
"Tired, tired of being admired...
"... tired of love uninspired.
"Let's face it, I'm tired.
"I've been with thousands of men again and again.
"They promise the moon.
"They're always coming and going and going and coming...
"... and always too soon. "
Right, girls?
"I'm tired.
Tired of playing the game.
"Ain't it a crying shame?
"I'm so tired. "
Goddamn it, I'm exhausted!
Hello, cowboy, what's your name?
"Tex ma'am"? Tell me, Tex ma'am...
...are you in show business?
Nope.
Well, then, why don't you get your friggin' feet off the stage?
Hello, handsome. Is that a 10-gallon hat, or are you just enjoying the show?
Oh, Miss Lili, oh, my lovely lady!
"Tired of playing the game.
"Ain't it a crying shame...
"... I'm so tired.
"She's tired.
"Sick and tired of love.
Give her a break.
"She's had her fill of love.
She's not a snake!
"From below and above.
Can't you see she's sick?
"She's bushed.
"Tired of being admired.
Let her alone.
"Tired of love uninspired.
"Don't you know she's pooped?
"I've been with thousands of men again and again.
"They sing the same tune!
"They start with Byron and Shelley...
"... then jump on your belly, and bust your balloon.
"Tired of playing the game.
"Ain't it a friggin' shame?
"I'm so... "
Let's face it. Everything below the waist is kaput!
What does it say?
"I must see you alone in my dwessing woom right after the show. "
Wie gehts, meine schatzie?
Faw out!
A wed wose. How womantic!
Have a seat, shewiff.
Won't you excuse me for a moment...
...while I slip into something a little bit more comfortable?
Bitte, baby.
Why don't you loosen your bullets?
Ahh, I feel wefweshed!
Isn't it bwight in here?
There! Isn't that better?
Pardon me, I'll be back in a moment.
How is it going?
He's like wet sauerkraut in my hands.
By morning he will be my slave.
Splendid.
Oh, just let me have a little feel.
Where were we? Where are you?
Let me sit down next to you.
Tell me, schatzie...
...is it, ah, twu what they say about the way you people are gifted?
Oh, it's twu, it's twu!
Vill you care for another schnitzengruben?
No, thank you. Fifteen is my limit on schnitzengruben.
Well, then, how about a little...?
Baby, please, I am not from Havana.
Excuse me, honey...
...besides, I'm late for work.
I've got some heavy chores to do.
Vill I, vill I see you later?
That all depends on how much
Vitamin E I can get my hands on.
Nein, nein, achtung!
No, no, you mustn't go! I need you!
I never met nobody like you!
I can't live without you!
Please, you're making a German spectacle of yourself.
Auf wiedersehen, baby.
Oh, what a nice guy.
Oh, deary, dear.
Look what the cat dragged in.
What's happening in the clean world?
Bad news.
I've got a writ here for Mongo's release signed by Hedley Lamarr himself.
Why would a dude like
Hedley Lamarr care about Mongo?
It's legal.
Oh, those schnitzengrubens can wipe you out!
Wake up time!
Okay, Mongo. You're free to go.
Mongo no go.
Oh, come on, Mongo.
You're a free man.
Mongo stay with Sheriff Bart.
Sheriff first man ever whip Mongo.
Mongo impressed, have deep feelings for Sheriff Bart.
Oh, you better watch out, big fella.
I think Mongo's taken a little fancy to you.
Mongo straight.
Maybe you know why a high-roller...
...like Hedley Lamarr is interested in Rock Ridge.
Don't know. Got to do with where choo-choo go.
Mongo, why would Hedley Lamarr care about where the choo-choo goes?
Don't know.
Mongo only pawn in game of life.
I think this might be a good time to mosey out...
...to where they're building the railroad...
...and maybe do a little snooping.
Damn, damn, damn!
Hey, how are you doing Bart?
Get down off that horse!
Oh, you shifty nigger!
They said you were hung!
And they were right!
Look at that star, hoo-ee!
Civil service!
Wait. Back off, scamp.
You are addressing the duly appointed sheriff of Rock Ridge.
Rock Ridge? Hey, the railroad is going through there!
Back up off your brother!
Don't mess up your brother!
Holy mother of pearl!
It's that nigger that hit me on the head with the shovel!
Now what the hell do you think you're doing with that tin star, boy?
Watch that "boy" shit, redneck! You're talking to the sheriff of Rock Ridge.
Well, now if that don't beat all!
Here we take the good time and trouble...
...to slaughter every last Indian in the West, and for what?
So they can appoint a sheriff that's blacker than any Indian!
I am depressed.
Excuse me, Mr. Taggart, sir, but I sure do hate to see you like this.
What if me and the boys were to shoot that nigger dead?
Would that pep you up some?
Well, it might help.
All right, boys. On the count of three.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Don't pay no attention to that alky.
He can't even hold a gun, much less shoot it.
Like I said. On the count of three.
One...
...two...
...three!
Well, just don't sit there looking stupid, grasping your hands in pain.
How about a little applause for the Waco Kid?
All right, I'm through being
Mr. Goodbar!
The time has come to act and act quickly!
All my plans have backfired!
Instead of the people leaving, they're staying in droves!
Vhy don't you admit it?
He's too much of man for you. I know.
You going to need an army to beat him!
You're finished.
Fertig! Fahrblunged! Fahrcocked!
Shut up! You Teutonic twat!
I must think.
Wait a minute. She said army.
Of course!
An army of the worst dregs ever to soil the face of the West!
I've decided to launch an attack that will reduce Rock Ridge to ashes!
What do you want me to do, sir?
I want you to round up every vicious criminal and gunslinger in the West.
Take this down.
I want rustlers, cutthroats, murderers, bounty hunters...
...desperados, mugs, pugs, thugs, nitwits, half-wits, dimwits...
...vipers, snipers, con men,
Indian agents, Mexican bandits...
...muggers, buggerers, bushwackers, hornswagglers...
...horse thieves, bull dykes, train robbers, bank robbers, ass kickers...
...shit kickers and Methodists!
Could you repeat that, sir?
Where's everybody going?
Read this.
Well, can't you see that's the last act of a desperate man?
We don't care if it's the First Act of
Henry the Fifth! We're leaving!
Now, wait a minute!
Wait just one doggoned minute!
Just give me 24 hours to come up with a brilliant idea to save our town.
Just 24 hours, that's all I ask.
No!
You'd do it for Randolph Scott.
All right, sheriff. 24 hours.
Next!
Qualifications?
Rape, murder, arson and rape.
You said rape twice.
I like rape.
Charming. Sign right here.
Take that badge.
Qualifications?
Arson, armed robbery, mayhem.
Wait a moment. What have you got in your mouth?
Nothing, eh? Lyle.
Gum!
Chewing gum on line, eh?
I hope you brought enough for everybody.
I didn't know there was going to be so many.
Boy, is he strict!
We've got to get in there close and find out what's happening.
There's our ticket!
Hey, boys!
Look what I've got there!
Hey, where are the white women at?
Man, that was pretty! I liked that.
Be ready to attack Rock Ridge at noon tomorrow. Here's your badge.
We don't need no stinkin' badges!
Next!
Qualifications?
Stampeding cattle.
That's not much of a crime.
Through the Vatican!
Kinky!
Why, Rhett, how many times have I told you...
...to wash up after weekly cross-burning?
See, it's coming off.
And now, for my next impression,
Jesse Owens!
Catch them!
Hold up, men, we'll head them off at the pass!
Head them off at the pass?
I hate that cliché!
Say, "hello. "
Hello.
Listen to me, and listen to me good.
I want you to get all the brothers together...
...round up all the lumber, canvas, paint and nails you can lay your hands on...
...and meet me tonight 3 miles due east of Rock Ridge at midnight.
You understand?
Say, "goodbye. "
Thanks a lot, brother.
All right, folks, I know you're a bit confused wondering what you're doing...
...out in the middle of the prairie in the middle of the night.
You bet your ass!
I'm hip.
Now, before the sun comes up...
...we're going to build on this sight an exact replica of the town of Rock Ridge.
Every building, every storefront, every rock and every tree...
...right down to the orange roof on Howard Johnson's outhouse.
I get it!
And tomorrow when Hedley Lamarr and his men come riding in...
...to destroy the real Rock Ridge...
...they'll actually be destroying the fake Rock Ridge!
But they'll think it's the real Rock Ridge!
But we'll know it's the fake Rock Ridge!
How're we going to do it? We don't have the time nor the people.
Wrong! There's why.
Who the hell are they?
Railroad workers. They've agreed to help us make our dream come true.
And all they ask in return is a little plot of land...
...they can call their own to homestead.
What do you say?
We'll give some land to the niggers and the chinks...
...but we don't want the Irish!
No deal.
Ah, prairie shit! Everybody!
Oh, Lord...
...do we have the strength to carry on this mighty task in one night?
Or are we just jerking off?
Okay, okay, we have done it.
Now, let's see what we have done.
Men, you are about to embark on a great crusade...
...to stamp out runaway decency in the West.
Now you will only be risking your lives...
...whilst I will be risking an almost certain Academy Award nomination...
...for Best Supporting Actor.
Now raise your right hand for the pledge.
Right!
And repeat after me. I...
...your name...
...your name...
Schmucks!
... pledge allegiance...
...pledge allegiance...
...to Hedley Lamarr...
...to Hedy Lamarr...
That's Hedley!
...that's Hedley...
...and to the evil...
...and to the evil...
...for which he stands!
...for which he stands!
Now go do that voodoo that you do so well!
Hold the happiness. We are in trouble.
Yep! We forgot one little detail.
Nothing is missing. Everything is here, down to the last hitching post.
People. There are no people.
Now don't panic. Don't panic.
We just made a perfect copy of Rock Ridge.
Now all we've got to do is make perfect copies of ourselves.
But they'll be here in half an hour.
Right, so we've got to start working fast.
You men start working on the dummies.
Jim and Mongo, come with me.
I've got an idea that will slow them down to a crawl.
All right, let's go!
Yeah, that's nice.
Le Petomane Thruway! Now what will that asshole think of next?
Has anybody got a dime?
Somebody's got to go back and get a shit-load of dimes.
Hurry up. Speed it up or we're never going to get to Rock Ridge!
Come on, move them through!
Well, they're through the tollbooth.
Look at this, they're buying it!
All right, here we go.
Hold your ears, folks!
It's show time!
Nothing!
What are we going to do?
Any minute now they're going to discover the town is fake and pull out!
You think you could squeeze off a little shot from here...
...and set off the dynamite down there?
I'll give it a try.
Oh, Lord, keep this man's eye keen...
...and may God grant...
It's a fake!
We've been suckered in!
Okay, folks, let's wipe them out!
Forgive me, Lord!
"Throw out your hands, stick out your tush.
"Hands on your hips, give them a push.
"You'll be surprised, you're doing the French Mistake. Voilà!"
All right, cut!
Wrong!
Just watch me. It's so simple!
You sissy Marys!
Give me the playback.
And watch me, faggots!
Have you got it?
Yessssssss.
Sounds like steam escaping!
Action! Okay, wait until I get out.
Cut! What in the hell do you think you're doing here?
This is a closed set!
Piss on you!
I'm working for Mel Brooks.
Not in the face!
Thank you.
They've hit Buddy!
Come on, girls!
You vulgar shit!
Why, you miserable pansy!
I'm parked over by the commissary.
You brute, you brute, you vicious brute!
All right, all right...
How many days do you have left, Joey?
They lose me right after the bunker scene.
What the hell is that?
Get your pies for the great pie fight!
This is our Studio commissary where some Hollywood stars...
...come to eat. Keep in line.
And now we'll go to the
Special Effects Department.
Yankee bean soup, cole slaw and tuna surprise.
Taxi!
Drive me off this picture!
You dropped your beads.
One, please.
Uh, student.
Are you kidding?
Pain in the ass.
Look, Herman,
I'm in Hedy Lamarr's shoes!
Hedley!
Freeze it!
Okay, Lamarr, go for your gun.
Wait, wait, I'm unarmed.
All right, we'll settle it like men.
With our fists.
Sorry, I just remembered. I am armed.
How did he do such fantastic stunts with such little feet?
You shot the bad guy!
Well, what do you want to do now?
Come on, let's check out the end of the flick.
I sure hope there's a happy ending.
I love a happy ending.
Sheriff, you can't go now.
We need you.
My work here is done.
I'm needed elsewhere now.
I'm needed wherever outlaws rule the West.
Wherever innocent women and children are afraid to walk the streets.
Wherever a man cannot live in simple dignity.
Wherever people cry out for justice.
Bullshit!
All right, you caught me.
To speak the plain truth, it's getting pretty damn dull around here.
Good luck, Bart, and God bless you.
'Bye, baby brother.
Keep the faith, brothers!
Where are you headed, cowboy?
Nowhere special.
Nowhere special.
I always wanted to go there.
Come on!
"He conquered fear and he conquered hate. "
"He turned our night into day. "
Hi, Eli.
Eli.
Morning, George.
This is a white man's saloon, and it sells white man's liquor, and I'm telling you to crawl your filth out of here, breed... before I kill you.
Ha ha ha ha.
Do you hear, you red-skinned nigger?
A white man's talking to you.
You need stepping on, breed.
Back off, lawman.
You hear that, George?
I'm gonna bleed you, boy.
Jesus!
I'll get Quincey Whitmore.
Some Indian, I think.
Eli's been shot dead, Captain.
Some injun. He's run.
An injun, you say?
Eli's been shot!
Apache.
I'll get Will Coop.
He wouldn't want to miss this.
The sheriff's dead.
Gonna get that injun, Quincey?
Who is it?
Nye?
What is it, Quincey?
What do you want?
Saunders, just been killed.
It won't stop the world a-turning.
Ah!
Now then, ain't you a picture?
An injun shot him.
Oh, and you got dressed up for the hanging, huh?
Well, we'll have to catch him first.
Get your pants.
Yeah.
Getting night, Quincey.
All we have is sand in the mouth, and the horses are tired sore.
How's Harvey's horse?
Uh, threw a shoe and a hoof's split.
Ain't nothing for us, Quincey.
We got to turn back or bed down out here.
Well... we could go to the Hooker brothers' place.
Only about 10, 12 miles from here.
We can night there.
Aah!
Aw, come on, honey.
It ain't gonna hurt none.
Just give me a little honey.
All right.
Now, I'll tan your hide, do you hear me?
Hey, Jubal, hey, Jubal, by all that's holy!
I'll take the skin off you, you don't bide what I say.
Ah! You're damn crazy!
She's kin.
Come on, get back to the house.
Ah!
What's with that fool dog?
Riders coming, Jubal.
Earl!
Looks like Captain Quincey.
You've been up to something else?
There's nothing touching me, Jubal.
Quincey, you're riding late.
Posse, Jubal.
We're hoping to put down here for the night.
Why, sure. Why not.
What's the trouble?
Apache breed shot Eli Saunders dead.
Jesus hell!
Saunders, dead.
Elias, get some food on that stove.
Earl, help with them horses.
You lose him, Quincey?
Yeah.
Aw, that's hell's doing.
You figure on pushing it on at first light?
Well, he headed south.
I don't hold out much hope.
Jesus, what is that?
Potato whiskey.
Ha ha ha.
I'd rather be belly-shot.
You get the first swallow down, the rest tastes good.
Earl's right, Harve.
It takes getting used to, like dying.
Ha ha ha.
After your first cup, Harve, you're blind anyway, and after your second, you're darn glad you're blind.
Well, if we catch this breed, we won't have to hang him.
We'll just give him a jug of this.
Hey, you're a cruel one, Harve.
Where's Jubal?
He'll be out back setting some traps.
You best take your spencer,
Captain Quincey.
The Everettes had some stock run off by some Mimbrenos.
You never know.
Shh.
It's me, Jubal.
I mean to be no trouble, Jubal.
Your company's welcome.
Been thinking on tomorrow.
Be obliged to hear.
Circle around by the Everettes', pick them up.
Then go on to the Malechie place.
He's got two Mex riders.
Then over to Ezra Meade's.
He has an old Tigua
Indian that can track.
We might cut his trail before he gets too far over the line.
Well...
Might be no more than catching the wind.
We'll get him.
Quincey, me and my brothers will go past the edge of hell, but we'll have that breed and we'll burn him!
We'll burn him!
Me and Eli, we walked the whole war together.
That puts a man close to you.
We'll surely have that breed and burn him.
How long you figure it'll take, Quincey?
Well,
3 or 4 days at the most.
Me and my boys are alone here now.
Mimbrenos run off three of my best beef last week.
I can't be gone long.
I heard.
I'd understand, Josh, if you wanted not to join...
No, no, no. I'm gonna ride with you. Gibbon?
Naw, I'll ride anyplace to see a dead injun.
This could be a good land without the injuns.
Comanches in Texas first, now the Apaches here... killing, robbing.
Naw, I'm gonna ride with you, but I just can't be gone long.
Gibbon, you stay close.
You mind your ma.
Giddyap. Giddyap.
Hyah.
Hah! Yah!
Gavin!
Good morning, Mrs. Malechie.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Everette, gentlemen.
I believe you know, uh,
Quincey Whitmore and the Hooker brothers and, uh, Nye Buell.
How do?
Nye.
Martin Hall and Harvey Lansing.
Morning, ma'am.
Hell, I've known him since he came here.
Morning, Gavin.
George Dunn from up wolf butte way.
Will Coop.
Set you down, gentlemen.
Come on inside with you now.
We're not here to be sociable, Malechie.
Some breed killed Eli Saunders.
We're huntin' him.
Thought you might like to ride with us.
Yes, I heard about it yesterday.
One of my vaqueros, he knew this half-breed called Pardon Chato.
He bought some horses off him a year back.
Does the Mexican know if the breed has a piece of ground to run to?
I'll ask.
He's with my brother-in-law Brady bringing in some strays.
I'll send for them.
You be coming with us, Mr. Malechie?
Soon as I wash up.
Will you have coffee and biscuits?
That's to my taste.
We'll ride to Ezra Meade's.
Get him and his Indian and meet up at the wells.
Aw, Jubal, I had a hankering for biscuits and coffee.
You'll do as I say.
Just keep moving.
You see that Brady Logan woman?
That's what I call a fine-looking woman.
Put it from your mind.
Thinking ain't sinning.
Jubal, don't you ever get bothered?
I swear, brother Earl, one of these days you're gonna get caught halfway up somebody else's peach tree, and you're gonna be dead.
Brady Logan and the Mexican.
I'm taking Raoul.
Do you have to go, Gavin?
You know I have to.
I hate it when you're gone.
You and Moira won't be alone.
I'm leaving the Mexicans.
That's not the same.
And what would they think of us, neighbors and all?
We're new here, Edna.
We're carving out a place here.
We've gotta do what's expected of us.
To hunt down some poor man?
He killed the sheriff.
And he's Indian.
Is your pa around, Jacob?
I'm around.
You're not going to ask to step down, Jubal?
We haven't given you any call to speak harsh words, Ezra.
Say your piece.
Eli Saunders was murdered by a 'pache breed.
The world won't grieve.
Quincey Whitmore has got up a posse.
We thought you might want to ride with us, Ezra, or leastways, lend us your injun to track.
I won't ride with your kind.
As for the injun, he's his own man.
He says the Apache's not his enemy.
Now, ain't that pretty?
We ain't gonna let no damn injun...
Shut your mouth.
He was a white man, Ezra.
He was a redneck with a loud mouth and a gun.
I heard he got no more than he called for.
Son, you wanna swallow back them words?
Ride out.
We're waiting for an apology, Ezra.
You'll not get one here.
Don't give me the pleasure.
Hyah!
Where's Meade?
He won't ride with us.
He favors the breed.
Ezra always was a mite stand-off.
It'll not be forgotten.
I always thought of Meade as a good neighbor.
Who's the Mex?
He rides for Malechie.
Looks more than half Apache to me.
He's part Yaqui.
You best keep a short rope on him.
We'll turn south from here and head towards the high country.
Keep spread out and hunt for sign.
Anyone see anything, raise a shout or shoot twice.
Malechie, tell your Mexican to scout ahead over by that long ridge.
That's the last place we caught his trail.
Si, senor.
Whiskey and a hot sun don't mix.
Well, neither does my ass and this damn saddle.
Anyhow,
I used to heard it said you boys that rode with hood drank five states dry.
Always tell where hood's Texans have been by the empty bottles and the dead Yankees.
And it was true.
From Cemetery Hill till old slow trot Thomas broke us at Nashville, we had more than our share of both.
You know, one thing I never could fathom, Quincey.
How did them Yankees win?
They had more... more men, more guns, more food, more luck.
You know, when I look back at it,
I know now that it was all there for the seeing, except we didn't see it.
Getting licked, I mean, as Early as '63.
Hood took us up little round top at Gettysburg.
And if we could have held it, we could have rolled back those Yankees like old carpets.
But there were too many of them.
They say from Culp's Hill, you could see it all clear.
Gray lines comin' like the sea wash, yellin' and sort of breaking up when they hit the blue ridge and then... fallin' back.
Lee cried.
I guess he knew.
Hell... it was a good war.
Hyah, hyah. Hey.
Apache.
You sure?
Cierto.
How long ago? When?
An hour, maybe less, he says.
It don't make sense.
How can you tell that?
From the droppings.
Sun dries them pretty damn quick.
Still fresh inside, means it ain't been long.
Looks like he stayed here quite a spell.
Don't make sense, Jubal.
Should have been long gone from here, a running man and all.
Might be he figured we stopped chasing him.
Circled around for some reason.
Might be.
If he does, we'll have us a hangin' come nightfall.
Still damn hot, even with those clouds.
Well, maybe it'll sweat some of the whiskey out of your hide, Nye.
Watch it. Watch it!
Who's down?
Watch the horses.
Will, you okay?
You all right, Quincey?
He's hurt.
How is it, Will?
Is it broken?
Don't know. How's it feel, Will?
Sore inside.
I don't think it's broke, but he can't ride.
George, can you get him back to Arillo?
Sure, Captain.
We'll make a travois for him.
There's some brush down at the bottom there.
My place is closer.
You can get a wagon there.
We got our work cut out.
You're the lucky one, Will.
Gonna be all right, Will?
Sorry, George.
It's all right, Will.
I got a feeling we're well out of it anyway.
The Mexican... pretty good... pretty good.
Damn this light.
Might as well bed down here for the night, get a fresh start in the morning.
Unsaddle and make camp.
Hell, there's no water here, Quincey.
We're gettin' low on water.
And the horses will need some.
Earl's gone huntin' for water.
You can bet the honeybee's sugar tit there ain't no water to find.
Look around... sharp rock, dry dirt, and that's all.
Each man ration his own water.
Damp down your neck cloths or some piece of something and wet down the horses' muzzles.
I've eaten so much of this damn land today,
I can't even spit.
You'll eat more of it tomorrow.
We haven't even seen the shirttail of him yet.
We don't even know if what we're chasin' is the breed that done it.
Jubal thought he'd have a hangin' by night.
The only hangin' is my ass.
Quincey!
What is it?
What's going on?
Let me see that.
There's no use staring at them.
That rotten bastard!
You figure it was the breed?
Who'd you figure it was?
He could have cut our throats.
Maybe he isn't a killing man.
He's half Apache, ain't he?
You mix dog and wolf, you wind up with a killin' animal.
He killed Eli.
That's a fact.
He's either a damn fool or he got some game.
Apache don't leave tracks unless they got a reason.
I don't like it.
I don't like it one bit.
You want to hightail it for home,
Harvey, do you?
I didn't say that.
We're gonna find that breed... and we're gonna hang him.
And nobody's gonna do different.
Now, hold on now, Jubal.
There's no cause for that.
Each man is here by his own doin'.
If a man wants out, he can.
I wouldn't ride with a man who didn't want to ride with me.
We're gonna ride till we get him.
What are you all thorn and thistle about, Jubal?
Harve didn't say nothin' about going back.
Here comes the Mexican.
Where in hell's he been?
Tracking.
One thing for sure, that breed ain't far ahead.
Says he found fresh tracks heading south towards the lava hills.
That's, uh... bad country, Quincey.
This ain't hardly the Garden of Eden.
Listen, Quincey, you know, could be that breed is leadin' and we're followin'.
And if it's true, he could be leadin' us into bad Apache trouble.
Them Mimbrenos that run off my beef a while back, they could be hiding up in the hills.
Mind ya, I'm just sayin' maybe.
Maybe.
Well, what do you think?
Well, I learned one thing when I was with...
Tom Jeffords chasing Cochise.
You can never know what's in an Apache's mind.
Ain't a man like... like we know a man.
He thinks Apache, and that's a... a shut book full of... terrible things.
I got a real dislike of red beans.
Gonna be a hot one.
No, maybe snow by noon, Elias.
Ha ha. And the devil take a chill, huh?
You sure as hell all speed.
Breakfast done.
You Indian dirt.
Now, you keep all your killin' feelings for what we gotta do.
I tell you, brother Earl, you got some kind of sweet disposition, all sun and little white flowers.
Pleasant company, them Hooker boys.
Nothin' movin'.
That don't mean a damn thing.
Watch that broken ground over there.
I'm going to have a look.
Nobody about for quite a spell, I'd say.
Hyah!
Mescalero.
Si, senor.
Ain't nothin' here.
Hey, look. They had themselves a feast.
What is it?
Dog.
Apaches think on dog like you think on a good steak, Brady.
He'd rather eat dog than beef.
If he was hungry, he'd eat his own dung.
Well, no more than any other man, and less than most.
They aren't men.
They're animals.
Yeah, God knows what God was thinking when he made the Apache.
We'll burn them wickiups and then we'll ride.
Hyah!
Come on, let's get this one!
Ha ha ha!
Hey, Quincey.
We can't ride across these flats.
We'll tear the hearts out of the horses.
Malechie's right, Jubal.
The breed will ride across.
If he does, he'll be on foot before night.
How many miles across do you figure, Buell?
Enough.
When we get this damn Indian,
I'm sure gonna make his dyin' slow.
Put God's word on that.
Him and his damn land.
Hey, maybe he's got a woman out there... someplace.
Jeez, Earl, don't you ever think about nothin' else?
Don't let the horses break.
Whoa. Whoa.
Come here, you son of a bitch.
Whoa. Whoa.
Easy, easy.
I don't see a thing.
You're welcome to take a closer look.
Martin, you all in one piece?
Yeah.
Mexican all right?
Yeah, I seen him move.
There's only one way, Jubal.
Let's get at it.
Nye, Elias, Jubal, and me are going in after him.
The rest of you, spread out and give us cover.
Martin, you stay with the horses.
Aah!
We've been suckered, Quincey.
That's a god-given fact.
He said it's the breed they call Chato, all right.
He can tell by the horse he rides.
Well, I didn't think it was the president of the United States.
We gotta find those horses before night.
Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa.
You fly-tailed bastard!
Whoa, red.
Whoa.
I swear, I'm gonna stretch your hide and leave the rest for the crows.
Two more, hot and ready.
I'll bet that horse tastes better than he rode.
Nye, you got your own mother in a skillet before she got cold.
He never met the lady.
Where you from, Brady?
Before you came out to the territory.
A place called Greenock on the west coast of Scotland.
I used to work in Lithgow's yards, shipwright.
You ever long for it?
Yeah.
Yeah, water and fire different, this land and there.
There, the river, the sea fog, gray stone houses wet in the rain.
We used to stand behind the town and look down over the slate roofs across the river to the highlands on the other side.
Yeah.
I never did get to look at the sea.
Brother Jubal did once.
Said it was so big the mind couldn't hold it.
Two more, hot and rare!
You from Georgia, too, Quincey?
Texas.
Better drag them horses off.
They'll call all the flies in by morning.
Earl?
How are we with water?
Gettin' short.
And we're three horses gone.
You're... you're going on after him, Quincey?
Well... when the breed hit us, he had a mind to turn us back.
An injun will chase something until the chasin' costs too much and then he'll drop it.
That's how he thinks.
Now, he don't plan on something comin' after him no matter what.
He might just get careless now.
I'm agreed.
I say no more than a week for it.
You can't put a halter on it.
I can for myself.
And what about the others,
Harve and Josh?
They get their say?
Anybody want to back down, they go on foot, leave their water for them that stay with it.
Jubal, you got more generosity than June.
That's a Georgia choice.
I must say, it'll cut short thinking on.
Ha ha ha.
Nye, what in the hell are we doin' out here?
We've got Indian fever.
Sweats in a man, drives him blind in the eye and not quite right in the head.
We ain't seen scratch nor hair of that breed since he buffaloed us.
I ain't sure I want to.
I got a bad feelin' comin' over me, Nye.
I'll bet the Mex got water.
Got water, Mex?
You're holdin' out on us.
Earl.
I don't trust him.
He got too much Indian in him.
He ain't tryin' to find the breed.
He's breed himself.
He's tryin' to lose us, I'm tellin' ya.
You stand by your man, Malechie?
He's a good man.
Yaqui-Mex is more than halfway Apache.
Yeah, why should he help us?
You got Malechie's word.
You got a sickness on you, Earl.
Can't bide anything injun.
Do you trust him, Captain?
Well, we used Apache scouts when we went after Cochise.
They never broke faith.
Apache don't give his word easy, but given, I've never known one to break it.
I guess it's same with the Yaquis.
I'm going to kill you, Mex.
Understand?
And that's a promise.
You mean face on... or when he gives you his back?
You're gonna put foot on my patch once too often, Malechie.
You don't frighten me, sonny.
Earl, put the gun down.
You hear me?
Put it down.
He got his heels into me, I swear.
Put the gun away now.
Right now.
Ooh.
Ugh.
All right.
You made your point.
Take it easy.
Hey, you sure are one hell of a fighter, brother.
Big party, went by today or day before.
Si.
Most likely a raidin' party.
Or a murdering party.
We left our women, our places.
They could be heading that way.
Some of these horses are shod and unrode.
It means they've... they've raided and are on their way home.
Headin' north?
Well, could be Comanche.
Comanches?
Comanches ain't this far south.
Kiowa raid into Mexico.
They've been as far south as Yucatan.
Could be Apaches just as easy, Quincey.
An injun don't raid with so many extra mounts.
They've been and got what they want.
I agree with Jubal.
Comanche.
Maybe a few Kiowa.
Well, that don't ease the mind none.
We might run into them.
That could be real bad.
If they caught us in this open ground...
Me and the Mex will scout ahead, Quincey.
I do believe you... you really enjoying this, Quincey.
Now, the Hookers, they hate better than most.
That pushes them.
The others?
Ha ha ha.
They had small choice.
But you, Quincey... with you, it ain't so easy to read.
You got a... hungering.
For a thirsty man in a dry land, you got a lot of talk, Nye.
You know, some men just can't let go of time.
Passes them by, reach out and grab her shirttails.
Ha ha. That's you, Quincey.
You can't be just another face around a small town. Mm-mm.
That's what you're doing, all wrapped in gray, sitting proud on that horse, chasin' one damn half-breed and thinkin' about that bastard grant and his Yankees.
Enjoy it, boys.
It's the end of the water.
We'll find water in the morning.
Why don't we just come out with it?
The breed's lost us.
W-w-we ain't seen none of his sign.
What is it you're saying, Josh?
I'm saying that we're chasing a bad guess, only.
We run out of water.
And we got nothin' left to eat except some red beans and some scrawny prairie chickens.
And you've got an itch to get back to where there's good food and a fat wife.
I got a spread back there that needs working.
All we got out here is a handful of nothin'.
Dirt and dry mouths.
Josh is right.
Like hell he is.
You've got the quittin' streak, too?
Don't lean too heavy on me, Jubal.
I don't bend easy.
How do you see it, Quincey?
As Josh says, we might be guessing, but I got a feeling we're not.
That breed tried to lead us off and then lose us.
He didn't head for Mexico, and he could've and made it, easy.
Instead he... he headed into bad country and then swung north.
Now, put that with the fact that he bought supplies in town, and I think that points to him having someplace he wants kept safe.
Uhh.
Heh heh.
What's the matter, Josh?
Just a coyote.
Josh sees that as bad medicine.
Ha ha ha!
You gettin' Indian on us, Josh?
Heh heh heh.
Come on. Ease up, Josh.
I'm gonna kill that dog.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha!
You wouldn't think a grown man would worry about a dog.
Oh!
What's troubling you, Josh?
Oh, Quincey, I don't know.
I don't know.
It's just that things aren't working out the way I figured they would.
Say, don't you ever have second thoughts?
You know, are you still as sure about what we're doin' as when we started?
I tell you, Quincey,
I ain't a believin' man, but I got a god-fear.
I think he's gonna lay his hand on us.
And that's the truth.
Whoooo!
Yuhoo! Whoo! Yip! Yip!
Whohoo-wee!
Hey-yah!
Give me my hat.
Get all the water out of my hat.
Come on, get it.
Don't fill your bellies too fast.
Ha! Stop that.
You see any sign?
Well, that raiding party turned to the northeast a couple miles back.
Nothing since.
Ha ha ha!
Then they must be Comanches.
I hope we don't step on their tails.
Better 10 Comanche than one 'pache.
That's just like saying,
"better pox than the plague."
I seen Comanches in Texas, and, boy, I never wanna see one again, I can tell you.
Well, you don't see Apache.
You don't hear 'em and you don't see 'em.
It's like an act of God.
Oh, you are a comfort,
Captain Quincey.
Hey! Hey!
Cut that out!
Ah!
Brother Earl!
Here's candy for ya. Ha ha!
Oh, yeah.
Hey, look what I found!
Oh, boy!
Look at that. Look at that.
Let's see what you got, squaw.
Whoa, my!
Who's first to the honey pot?
Break get all couple of home here.
Ha ha ha!
You gonna stop that, or am I?
Don't get between a dog and his bone.
You too frightened, man?
This ain't the army, Malechie.
These men have no cause to listen to me.
Aah!
You stay clear of her.
Take her inside.
Come on. Get her up.
We got to organize this thing.
Come on. Hold it there.
What's the matter with you all?
Can you not see it?
There's no right in what we're doing.
It's against God.
She's a squaw.
Don't waste any sweat over it.
Malechie, did you ever see what injuns do when they get a white woman?
Aah!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
All right!
Tie her down. Tie her good.
This ain't right, Jubal.
Ever hunt wolf?
Get the mate, stake it out.
The other one always comes.
He'll come for her.
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Well, now, well, ain't that a courtesy?
Staking out a claim, Quincey?
Ha ha ha!
Well, it's gonna be dark soon.
Take up your positions.
Well, come on. Go ahead!
He'll be here, sooner or later, for sure.
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Do you think he'll come?
I hope not.
I want it done and be home.
We'll not be clean of it even then.
We shouldn't be here, Gavin.
Get them horses out of there!
Everybody, shoot the scoundrel down!
Look! He's up on the roof!
Let's get the horses.
Where the hell is he?
Up there! Up there!
Yah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Get 'em out!
Hyah! Hyah!
Seen that?
Thought I saw somethin' move.
Aah!
I... I... I think I got him.
Yeah.
Hall, check the woman.
Put out those fires!
Woman is cut loose and gone!
He's got the woman!
Yeah, you like startin' fires, don't you, you old bastard?
Earl, bring a rope!
What's troubling him?
He says they're beasts and fools.
The Apache will kill now.
No, no, no. He'll run...
Now that he's got the woman.
You figure he'll come back?
He got what he come for.
Would you have dared it, comin' in to get her?
No.
I would've.
Why?
For a squaw?
She was a good lookin' woman.
Earl, there never was a woman born worth dyin' for.
You don't feel for nothin', do you, Elias?
Know somethin'?
Come sunup,
I'm goin' out after her.
You got the fever.
I want that woman for my own.
Well, now, Earl, brother Jubal might get a little bit upset, you marrying a squaw.
Jubal!
Jubal don't own me.
What did I ever get from him?
Whippin' and hard words.
What are we, Elias?
Hatin' and killin' and whorin'.
Runnin' scratch cattle.
Ain't got nothin' soft.
Ain't got nothin' don't go bitter in the mouth.
I want somethin'.
Well, Earl, you better wipe them drippings from your mind.
You don't see, do you?
Like you got a box around your head.
The woman, she'll slow him down, Quincey.
It's a carving of a little bear.
Found it inside with some others.
Means there's a child.
That don't change anything.
Yeah, it does.
If we catch up to him, we hang him, but... the woman and the child, if they're with him, they go unharmed.
I want your word on that, Jubal, or you and your brothers can go it alone.
Well, you're gonna have a tough time convincin' Earl that way.
He wants that woman.
Where is Earl?
He went after her soon as it got light.
Why didn't you stop him?
Well, he was in no mind to pay heed.
You didn't even try, did you?
He's full-growed, Jubal.
I oughta whup you.
But you won't, Jubal,
'cause you know I'd put a hole in your gut.
Best wait for breakfast, Jubal.
Grab all you can to eat.
We leave in 5 minutes.
What's the hurry?
Earl went after the woman.
Jesus hell.
I'm obliged, Quincey.
Whoa.
His horse bolted.
Hyah. Giddyup.
Take your hands of Cain from him.
I... I don't want to bury him here.
It's an empty place.
Empty.
Nothin' to remember.
We command into thy hands of mercy, most merciful father, the soul of our brother departed.
We commit his body to the earth beseeching thy infinite goodness to give us grace to live in thy fear and love and to die in thy favor.
No promises now, Quincey.
May God pity the man that comes between me and that... and that breed.
Even an Apache woman's got to slow down soon.
I doubt if the woman's with him now.
Sure leavin' a good trail.
He ain't runnin'.
Well, you think he'd make a fight of it?
When he chooses.
Quincey, you know, I think he's doubled back on himself.
I think he's leadin' us in a circle.
I noticed.
Well, what's he doin'?
He's pickin' his ground, I'd say.
What's that supposed to mean?
To you this is so much bad land.
Rock, scrub desert, and then more rock.
A hard land that the sun has sucked all the good out of.
You can't farm it, you can't carve it out and call it your own, so you damn it to hell, and it all looks the same.
That's our way.
To the breed, now, it's his land.
He don't expect it to give him much, and he don't force it none.
And to him, it's almost human, a livin', active thing.
And it'll give him a good place to make his fight against us.
You know, sometimes you spook me, Quincey.
Where?
Just one horse goin' that way.
Maybe he cut the other one loose.
Maybe, maybe not.
He's cut back and got behind us.
We'd best backtrack and see if we can find out where he turned off.
What if he went straight on?
We lose a little time.
Better that than a scalp or two.
You're guessin', Captain.
We're both guessin'.
All right, Quincey, what do we do?
Spread out and find where he turned off.
Keep a sharp eye.
The breed ain't gonna give us much ground for mistakes.
What's the matter?
Look about you, Jubal.
Wouldn't you say that this is... about as good a place as you can find to do your killin'?
If he was up there in those rocks, we'd be easy to cut off.
Well, we'll just have to climb a bit, that's all.
And climb right into him?
He can't be on both sides.
Well, behind us or in front of us, once we start scramblin' up there, we've lost our mobility.
We'd be like lame men.
It's too steep, and we got horses.
We can't pull our horses up through there, not and move fast.
Do you think he's up there, Quincey?
Well, he might be.
Aw, he's got you so you're scared to move, Captain.
He's only a lousy Indian.
He's half Apache.
We're ten men!
This morning, we were eleven.
You seem awful sure he'll make a stand of it.
We raped his woman and killed his kin.
Do we wait for dark?
That wouldn't give us much.
We'd have to ride fast over blind ground.
We pull back.
Try to find a way around it.
We'd lose too much time.
You're blind, Jubal.
You can't see for hate.
Try to go around?
That might take 5 or 10 miles.
We'd lose what's left of today and half of tomorrow tryin' to pick up his trail again.
Why, I'd kill the man who'd let that breed get away!
I told you that this morning, and I mean it!
Mount.
Keep low and... and ride like hell.
Ho!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Quincey! Josh!
It's Hall.
Somebody's got to go back for him.
No. He's probably dead, Gavin.
How do you know?
Maybe he's just wounded.
You better hope he's dead.
This falls on you, Jubal.
You'd do well, Quincey, to close your mouth.
We know where the breed is.
We can box him in on that ridge.
There's hundred ways out of there.
Logan, Malechie, stay with the horses.
We'll go in.
Right, matey. Come on.
Ah!
Over here!
Quick!
Sweet mother of whores.
It's a... it's a hell of a place to die in.
There ain't no good places.
I guess not.
The breed came.
He grabbed my hair, just stared at me.
I guess Josh was right about that coyote.
God, I don't want to die.
Let's get him out of here!
Come on, Hall.
Easy, Hall.
O Lord, we beseech thee, mercifully hear our prayers and spare all those who confess their sins unto thee.
And they whose consciences by sin are accused by thine merciful pardon may be absolved, through Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
Have mercy on me, o God, according to thy loving kindness.
According to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sins, for I acknowledge my transgressions.
My sin is ever before me.
Against thee, thee only have I sinned.
I've done this evil in thy sight.
Your words are no use, Scotsman.
Close your book.
My mind's on a... on a pretty little whore in Lordsburg.
Nye, Nye, once I knew a pretty little girl.
Once I had a pretty little girl
Pretty little whore in Lordsburg
Eyes like berries
and lips like cherries...
Come at us!
He's just lettin' you know he's out there.
Are you just gonna leave him?
Well...
We can't sit around here all day waitin' for him to die.
I've had my fill of you, Jubal.
Go, then. And God mark you for the man that you are.
Don't drop that hammer.
He's got us in the open.
Anybody see where them shots come from?
From the hills somewhere.
Quincey! Quincey!
Get on your horses and ride out of rifle range.
Quincey, my shoulder,
I think it's broke.
Can you make it to the horses?
I'll have to.
Hyah!
Ha! Ha!
Ha!
Get him down.
Easy.
He's up in them high rocks.
We can circle wide and get behind him.
Malechie, you stay with the horses.
Right.
Ugh.
Nothing?
Nothing.
The breed got him.
Yeah.
Can't be sure of that.
Yeah, I think we can.
It's as if the ground had opened and devoured him.
You can't fight what you can't see.
He'll hunt us down... one after one... till we're all gone.
It looks bad.
Josh needs doctoring.
Harve's right.
He won't make it without help.
We're goin' back tomorrow.
No.
Nobody is runnin' from this.
Stay if you want, Jubal.
The rest of us are... goin' back in the morning.
You saw Earl.
You all saw what was done.
If I don't get to a doctor, I'll die.
Looks that way.
You want blood for blood, don't you, Jubal?
We came here to hang a murderin' breed, and hang him we will.
What's the matter with you?
He's got us beat.
Can't you see that?
Brother... looks like Harvey's lost his taste for justice.
You came to hunt a man because he was half Apache.
You raped and killed to feed your hunger.
In the name of God, don't call it justice.
Ha ha! Listen to our bible tongue.
What sets you apart?
You rode with us.
You got the same dirt we got.
We got three... maybe four dead and one bad wounded.
We're goin' home in the morning.
Damn you to hell, Quincey Whitmore.
I've taken enough of your words.
Now I don't want to kill you, Quincey, but by God's own eyes, I will, right here and now, where you stand if you call me to it.
We stay.
Now I want to hear you say it clear and straight out,
"we stay till that
Apache breed is hung."
You think you can hold us with your gun?
Yes, I do.
Say it, Quincey.
Well, speak, man.
Do what he wants now, and he'll have us savages like himself.
We stay... till the Apache breed is hung.
Josh and me are leaving, Jubal.
Well, I never judged you to have bone enough, Harvey.
Well, that breed's got us beat, and Josh gotta have a doctor.
Elias, if you move from that blanket, you'll put the death on your brother.
You ready, Josh?
Jubal, I gotta get to a doctor.
I wouldn't run out on you otherwise.
Oh, I know that, Josh.
Every man's got an end to his rope.
I'll bear no hurt against you.
If a man feels he must pull a gun on another that he's ate with and rode with, well, then it's best that they part.
Quincey, I'm sorry.
We looked to you.
But last night you left us no choice but this way.
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
I can't stomach a man who runs out on his friends.
Drop them.
Leave it.
God, Quincey.
Do I go after him, Jubal?
You do.
Don't kill him unless you have to.
Now, you two, stack them guns right there.
Come on.
You got nothing to gain by trouble save a lonely dyin'.
Just remember that.
If the Apache comes, you grab for them guns.
If not, don't you get within 6 feet of them.
Now, look to Quincey.
Take care, hear?
Right, Jubal.
Mmm.
Don't fuss me.
Quincey...
Quincey, I...
Earl...
Earl was the youngest.
He was just 16 when the war started.
Well, there was nothin' before the war... nothin' after.
You understand me, Quincey?
I need to see that breed dead.
I can't step past that.
You knew.
I told ya.
I got no... hate against you, Jubal.
Ten years ago, I'd have...
I'd have killed you for what you did last night.
Ohh...
Ohh, God.
Ha... you should've seen us at Chickamauga.
Damn that George Thomas.
Damn him for... for all the men he put in the ground that day.
Hooker took the ridge.
And you could hear... the screamin' men... dyin'.
It's like... it's like a flower that grows in the night.
You know...
I always wanted a... dog... ha ha.
When I... I was a boy.
But I...
I...
How long's it been now?
More than four hours.
Nearer five.
What's holdin' you, Elias?
He'll not come now.
I'm thin on patience, Malechie, so bite hard and shut tight.
You know it's true.
You'll never see him again.
He's lying out there somewhere, like Josh... maybe not so lucky.
He'll come.
All right, cover him with rocks to keep them birds off.
Hurry... hurry with the fire, Gavin.
We shouldn't take the risk.
Will you hark to what they've said?
Or will you move your beeves from Texas across the river red?
They're betting you can't make it, but you bet your life they're wrong.
So keep riding toward the Pecos to find where you belong.
Can you still keep going on?
Well, you've crossed beyond the Brazos, fought Comanches, rain, and sand.
You brought your cattle westward, but is this your promised land?
You made it to the Pecos, carved your empire 'neath the sun.
You won a hundred battles, but the fight keeps going on.
Can you still keep going on?
You two go ahead.
I'll ride up and fetch him.
He's been up there over an hour.
What's he do on that hill?
I don't think you'd understand.
Thinking about the beginning?
And before.
Everything's different now.
Not everything.
Most everything.
Comanches all penned up. Buscaderos staying on their side of the Rio Grande.
Yankee Army prodding around, people crowding in.
Too many changes.
Things usually change for the better.
Let's go meet the stage.
Just what we don't need around here, some scrawny, milk-drinking...
- What are you mumbling about, Pepper?
- You heard me.
I didn't hear you.
There's an old Comanche saying about females.
This female's no Comanche.
I guess she doesn't have nowhere else to go.
- She does.
- Then what's she coming here for?
Because she wrote and said she was.
It has been a long ride, you know.
- All of this belongs to Chisum.
- All this and much more.
Much land, much horses, and much cattle.
Too much. No?
Neemo, here's your pay.
And now I collect a bonus... from Chisum.
He thinks he's going to a picnic.
He ain't met Chisum yet.
- I wanna be elsewhere when he does.
- We will be.
Come on. Giddyup.
Come on.
"L.G. Murphy and Company."
I told you Murphy was throwing a wide loop.
There's no law against a man going into business... or businesses.
There's more of it.
One day he's gonna take over...
Quit picking on him.
He hasn't bothered us.
Wait and see. He'll rue the day.
Why the hell they call it the noon stage?
Half the time it don't get in before sundown.
Had to call it something.
Might as well wet our windpipes.
That's the most sensible thing
I've heard all day.
- Amos, what's going on here?
- Pulling out, John.
I hadn't heard you'd sold the place.
Didn't sell. Lost it. New owner.
If you needed money, I'm sure...
All the credit you've given around here.
No, John, it's not just the money.
It's, well...
I don't know.
Lincoln just ain't the same no more.
I'm heading for Yuma.
Mr. Chisum!
Jim and Tyke's been shot.
They took the remuda.
How many are there?
A dozen, heading south, over at the Tunstall spread.
Let's go get 'em back.
Chisum's again. Another jinglebob, sir.
- Turn him loose.
- Yes, sir.
Another jinglebob. Big old calf on her.
No brand.
He belongs with his mother.
Turn him loose.
Turn him loose, Charlie.
I don't see why we can't keep the calf.
Probably born on your land.
William, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's property."
That calf's out of a Chisum cow.
Yeah, but she's probably sired by a Tunstall bull.
- You know 'em, sir?
- Yes, William, I do.
As a matter of fact, it's the owner of those cows.
- Henry.
- John.
Thought you were meeting your niece today.
I aim to.
First I gotta get some horses back.
- Trouble?
- Horse thieves.
- Could you use some help, Mr. Chisum?
- William.
See you later, Henry.
Mr. Tunstall,
I know you don't believe in guns... but I got a feeling
Mr. Chisum's gonna have need of his.
- Well...
- Well, what?
He didn't say no.
- How do we work this?
- I'm going down there.
The rest of you cover me with your long guns.
- I said...
- I heard you, Mr. Chisum... but I ain't the rest of 'em.
Welcome, my friend.
My name's Chisum.
Those animals are mine.
- There must be some mistake here.
- You made it.
No, Chisum. You make the mistake.
You don't bring enough men with you.
Mr. Chisum said to stay here and cover him with our long guns.
Never was much good with a long gun.
But I tell you what.
We have a long way to go, and a horse is a lot of trouble.
So if you want these horses,
I sell them to you.
Did you bring some gold with you?
No.
Silver?
Just lead.
No. You can't buy anything with lead.
I guess I have to kill you and take your horses, too.
Let 'em go, mister.
We got what we came after.
Pretty good shooting, young fella.
- You three all right?
- You bet we're all right. American.
You go and meet your niece.
We'll take care of things around here.
Thanks, Henry.
About that reception for Sallie, bring this young fella along.
I will, and it's about time you two were introduced.
This is William Bonney.
- Bonney?
- Came to work for me last month.
William Bonney from up Silver City way?
Sometimes.
You also called Billy the Kid?
Sometimes.
Does that change your mind, Mr. Chisum?
An invitation's an invitation.
Thanks, John.
Letting the fox into the henhouse, that's what it is.
- Pepper, what are you mumbling about?
- Nothing.
It didn't sound like nothing.
You invited him.
Yeah, I did.
But, señor, we have always watered our herds at Muddy Creek.
As I explained to your friends,
Muddy Creek's private now.
Bourbon.
But, señor, our herds are small.
There is more than enough water at Muddy Creek, and yesterday...
I know all about yesterday.
Now listen, Delgado.
I told them then, and I'm telling you now.
And if you don't understand plain English... maybe there's something else you will understand.
Dolan, just a minute.
I'm sorry, Señor Delgado?
Sí, Señor Murphy.
I'm gonna be running a lot of beef, and I need every drop of water I can get.
I'm sorry.
- Juan.
- Sí, Señor Chisum.
You and your compadres can water your herds along the Jicarilla.
It's not much farther, and it's a whole lot cleaner.
Gracias.
- What are you waiting for?
- Gracias, señor.
John, that's very generous of you.
Buy you a drink?
You've been buying a lot of things around here lately.
Yeah, I just acquired some land that's contiguous to your spread.
But, what the hell?
Half of New Mexico territory is contiguous to your spread.
Let me have my bottle.
John and I are gonna have a drink.
- Nope.
- Why not?
- I don't like you.
- You don't know me.
I know Amos Patton.
We may have to be neighbors... but I don't have to be neighborly.
I heard you ran into some trouble today.
Can I do anything for you?
Brady, aren't you standing on the wrong side of that badge?
I'm the new sheriff, duly appointed.
Noon stage got in, Mr. Chisum.
What do you think, Pete? 4:30 p.m.
Old Jeb made good time. Whiskey.
- Mr. Chisum, if I can do anything for you...
- Not likely.
Sheriff.
Your name John Chisum?
- That's right.
- I thought so. My name's Alex McSween.
My wife and I came in on the stage with Sallie.
That's very nice. Where...
She went over to that stable over there.
Much obliged. Pepper. Pardon.
- What's she doing in there?
- How should I know?
- Uncle John. You got $50 on you?
Thanks.
- You're welcome, and hello!
- Hello!
- She's your niece.
- Yeah.
Uncle John, meet Bernard.
Bernard?
- You gave $50 for this horse?
- Meet Pepper.
No, $100. I had $50 on me.
I've been thinking about having my own horse again since I left Baltimore.
You know, we have a few horses at the ranch.
But those are yours. This one's mine.
- Half yours.
- I'll pay you back the $50.
How about just paying me back?
Cass'll take care of your bags.
Which are yours?
- First one there.
- I see you found her.
- Yes.
- Uncle John...
- We've met.
- That's good.
I've invited the McSweens to that party you wrote me about.
You did? How about you folks?
Have you a place to stay until you get settled?
That's very nice of you, but...
Sue and I are staying in town.
I'm going to work for L.G. Murphy and Company.
Yes, I know the company.
If you'll pardon us, we'd better get underway.
- Goodbye.
- We'll see you Friday.
There sure is gonna be some interesting people at that party.
There's Mr. Murphy, honey.
Dominoes?
It's quiet. Takes some getting used to.
It beats Aunt Martha and Baltimore.
I had no idea your ranch was so big.
Fair size.
Take a man on a good horse all summer to cover it.
It's beautiful.
No place on God's earth more beautiful.
I can see why you left Texas and came here.
- That wasn't exactly the reason.
- I know.
Mother told me all about it.
About how hard things were in Texas after the war.
She talked about you a lot.
How you gambled everything on a cattle drive... to some wild, faraway place called New Mexico.
It was a gamble, all right. And it was wild.
But there was land here for the taking and keeping... if you were willing to fight.
Rustlers, disease... the land itself, the Indians...
One Indian in particular.
Comanche chief named White Buffalo.
He was the bravest man I ever knew.
- Is he dead now?
- Might as well be.
He's penned up on a piece of desert the government calls a reservation.
That was the end of his way of life.
Pretty good way, too.
You sound as if you're sorry for him, your enemy.
I respect him. We're brothers.
As close as your father and I were.
Maybe even closer.
- I don't understand.
- I didn't expect you to.
I wonder what's keeping supper?
- That's Mother and Dad's wedding picture.
- Yeah.
North wind.
Tahnimara the Comanches call it.
- Lonely wind.
- Lonely wind.
You had to be Ionely out here all these years.
You never married.
It wasn't because there weren't women that stirred my blood.
There were.
This was no place to bring a woman in those days... raise a family...
Things are different now.
Uncle John... thanks for asking me to come and stay with you.
I didn't ask you.
$12 for a suit of clothes.
That's robbery, Mr. Tunstall.
You've got to be properly dressed for the reception tonight.
- I'll pay you back at the end of the month.
- No, you won't.
That's just part of your raise as line foreman.
- Line foreman?
- Laddie, you've earned it.
Thank you, Mr. Tunstall.
Billy? Hey, Billy!
Now ain't this just like old times?
Billy, you do remember the boys now, don't you?
Yeah.
- How you been, Billy?
- Clean and forward, all the way.
Are you two friends, William?
Mister, a couple of years ago,
William here and me... rode together both sides of the border.
We sure had some real good times, didn't we, Billy?
Some good, some not as good.
- What are you doing now, Billy?
- I work for Mr. Tunstall here.
- You nursing cows?
- Yeah.
Our own cows.
Now, just what is that supposed to mean?
It means it ain't like old times, Jess.
That's interesting, William.
- Jess Evans?
- Yeah.
I'm Riker.
- We've been waiting for you.
- You don't have to wait anymore.
- How's things in Dodge?
- Dead.
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.
- Here's your bourbon.
- On the inside.
- Confusion to the enemy.
- Sure.
Mr. McSween, how long have you known
Lawrence G. Murphy?
Not long. I was here on business recently, and he offered me a proposition.
So I went on back to Kansas... and wound things up, and came on back to Sioux.
- What are you gonna do for him?
- I'm gonna handle his legal affairs.
Are you looking for your niece?
Isn't that her dancing with that nice-Iooking young fellow over there?
- Yeah.
- Fine-Iooking couple, John.
- Give me another cup of that tar, Ben?
- Sure, Jeff.
Hello, the camp!
Stranger, ain't you?
Around here. Not other places.
It's a fair-sized gathering of beeves you've got out there.
- Lose your horse?
- Some miles back.
- Whose brand's on 'em?
- Tonight it's John Chisum's.
Tomorrow it'll be the U.S. Army's.
- Buffalo hunter?
- Was, till there was no more buffalo.
The coffee smells good.
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.
Garrett. Pat Garrett.
You know they've got company.
- Who?
- Mr. Chisum's beeves.
What kind of company?
It's good coffee.
About 12, 14 riders moving slow and quiet.
- You want some company?
- How do we know you're not with them?
- I'll stay and finish the coffee.
- No. You come along with us.
I'll need a horse.
Take the buckskin. Let's go!
Take cover!
Bring 'em on! Now pour it to 'em!
Scare up them beeves!
Let's go.
This one's just creased.
We'll take him back to Mr. Chisum.
Lock him up in the smokehouse.
We'll take him to town in the morning.
What about the herd?
All them beeves are scattered from here to next week.
Sure ain't gonna deliver 'em to the Army tomorrow.
Gather as many as you can.
He'll probably be your first legal affair.
What do you mean by that?
I don't know what I mean yet.
Thank you for the help,
Mr. Garrett, was it?
Pat Garrett.
- Texas?
- Texas.
Looking for a job?
Not just now. I saved a small poke.
I thought I'd try my hand at gambling.
- Good.
- I'd appreciate the loan of a horse, though.
Take your choice and keep it.
- Thank you.
- You hungry?
No, but I didn't get a chance to finish that cup of coffee.
Coffee? I think we can do better than that.
- That girl.
- What about her?
She's pretty enough to be from Texas.
She is from Texas. You ought to meet her.
Sallie, I want you to meet Pat Garrett.
- This is my niece, Miss Chisum.
- How do you do?
Pat Garrett, meet Billy Bonney.
Hello.
I've heard of you.
Wasn't rustling.
Just out riding, and his men started shooting at us.
Just out for a moonlight ride on my land.
Who was with you?
I got nothing more to say.
Don't worry, Mr. Chisum.
We'll get to the bottom of this.
Yes, Sheriff, we will get to the bottom of this.
One of my men is dead.
I've sent for Judge Wilson over in Mesilla.
There's gonna be a murder trial.
I ought to have a doctor.
- I bled some.
- Not enough.
The Sheriff's charming.
There's a lot of charming people hereabouts, Pat.
If you change your mind about that job, let me know.
Sounds good enough.
You got time for a drink?
- Bourbon?
- Just one.
It's a big move for Sue and me.
You don't have any idea how big.
I've only been out here for a short time.
But I'm putting together an organization bigger than anything the West has seen:
Land, mining, cattle, freighting, speculation.
That does sound big.
And it sounds like it'll take a lot of doing.
You'll find I'm pretty well-connected here.
Here, look at this.
I can show you a shortcut to the whole proposition. Chisum.
The King of the Pecos.
He got here first. He holds the key.
The Pecos River runs through the middle of his land.
So?
He lets the water flow to all the ranches, big and small.
If another man, with more appetite, owned that land... he'd control a territory bigger than most states and some countries.
- Yeah, but another man doesn't.
- I know. Not yet.
But that's not just a map.
That's a chessboard.
And if another man makes the right moves... there might just be a new King of the Pecos.
Gentlemen, come in.
Sheriff Brady, Jess Evans, this is Alex McSween.
He's part of the family.
- Howdy.
- What does he do?
He used to be a storekeeper, and now he's my lawyer.
I prefer storekeepers.
Then don't ever get arrested.
I don't intend to.
Neither did Riker.
- Lawrence...
- Okay.
All right, Sheriff.
Listen, Alex, would you excuse us for a minute?
Certainly.
First it was Neemo, then Riker.
Now Chisum's sent for Judge Wilson.
- What do we do?
- Have some wanted posters printed up.
- On who?
- Riker.
- What for?
- Your prisoner's going to escape.
- He is?
- He is.
Tell him to wait in the line shack on Bony Ridge... till the judge gets tired of waiting around.
- How much?
- How much what?
- How much reward? $100, or...
- No.
Don't be a piker, man. $200...
Nobody's gonna collect it.
Why get in a frazzle over Chisum?
You turn me loose on him... there'll be a sudden funeral right here in Lincoln.
Yours.
How's that?
- Do you play chess?
- Chess?
What the hell has that got to do with Chisum?
Everything. You just leave him alone.
I'll take care of him.
- That ain't gonna be easy.
- You're right.
But there's a fundamental difference between Mr. Chisum and me.
What's that?
Mr. Chisum is a man who respects the law.
Around here, I'm the man who owns it.
Get out of here! You miserable...
Next one goes in your gut.
Put the gun away, William.
- What's the trouble, Juan?
- No trouble.
This greaser was just trying to tell me how to run my business.
And just how did he go about that?
They have nearly doubled the prices.
We can't pay what they ask.
You don't like it, go elsewhere.
Maybe they will.
There is no place within 100 miles.
About those prices, Mr. Murphy.
Prices are always going up.
Sign of a healthy economy.
Or a healthier profit.
If he needs money, he can arrange a loan at the bank.
The bank'd be happy to mortgage his spread.
Maybe that's what we need around here.
Another bank.
You plan on starting one, Mr. Chisum?
Why not? All it takes is money.
Yes, we might even start up a store, too.
Just in the spirit of healthy competition, of course.
Talk to you later, Henry.
Right, John.
- ¿Qué tal, Juan?
- Regular.
- Billy, gracias.
- De nada.
Billy.
I see you're still pretty handy with that six-killer.
I hit where I aim.
Company, halt!
- What else?
- Nothing else, Colonel.
We brought enough beef for White Buffalo's people to get by.
I'll deliver the rest at the weekend, if it's all right with you and White Buffalo.
Chisum's word.
I am not interested in your opinion of Mr. Chisum's word.
Sir, I understand your problem, but you have to understand mine.
Would you mind explaining?
There are many problems attendant to running such a large territory.
I don't propose to dwell on them here and now.
What do you propose to do here and now?
I've already done it.
When I heard what happened to your cattle...
I made arrangements for the delivery of another herd at a very good price.
Didn't take you very long.
I have to do what is right for the Army and the territory.
You don't have to put it in triplicate.
I get the idea.
White Buffalo.
Sgt. Braddock will escort you back to the reservation.
That is all, White Buffalo.
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir?
- Straightaway.
- All right, follow me.
Chisum.
Into the wagon.
Hey, Indian!
Chisum, this change nothing between us.
You heard the Colonel, blanket-head.
Straightaway.
Just a minute, Sergeant.
- You know who you're talking to?
- Looks like an Indian to me.
- He's a prince of the Comanche nation.
- I don't care if he's the king of Romania.
The Colonel said, "Straightaway."
Let's move it.
Hold on, Sergeant. Have a cigar.
- Have a cigar.
- Don't mind.
One other thing you ought to know.
You touch White Buffalo again and I'll kill you.
Sergeant, we go now.
Trace, you and Cass take care of the beef.
Count 'em at fours. Forward, ho!
Forward, ho!
Nathan, looks like we're in business.
Are you sure you can provide that much beef?
Don't worry. Army'll get its beef, and a lot cheaper than from Chisum.
You're in charge of this territory, not him.
After you've served your tour of duty... you'll be an officer in the L.G. Murphy bank.
- Your family will like that.
- Your bank has nothing to do with this.
I'm in the Army. I wouldn't do anything...
And I wouldn't ask you to.
I'll take care of the details.
And I wouldn't do anything to insult your integrity.
Pepper, look.
Yup. That's ol' Tropadero.
He's led us on many a cattle drive.
He brought your uncle's herd here, all the way from Texas.
You and Uncle John have come a long way together, haven't you?
A long way.
Over there's an old Comanche burying ground.
"The Lord said unto Cain,
'Why art thou wroth?
"'And why is thy countenance fallen?
"'Lf thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?
"'And if thou doest not well...
"'sin lieth at the door.'
"And Cain talked with Abel, his brother.
"And it came to pass, when they were in the field...
"that Cain rose up against his brother and...
"slew him."
Howdy.
Do you always greet people with so much fanfare?
No, ma'am.
Truth is, I was just...
Just what?
Mr. Tunstall loaned me his Bible here so I could practice my reading.
Looks like that ain't all you were practicing.
- Which part were you reading?
- About how Cain killed Abel.
You know that was the very first killing?
Yes, I know.
Sure has been a passel of 'em since then.
There sure has.
So long, Bonney.
- Keep practicing, Billy.
- Yes, ma'am.
So they're all in it together.
It may be a chess game to Murphy... but I don't like his methods, and I can't go along with him.
It's very kind of you to tell me, Alex... but I'm a pretty good chess player myself.
If I were you,
I'd cut off the water to his property.
I can't do that without affecting Henry and a lot of other outfits.
What are you figuring on doing?
Sue's packing, and we're gonna go on back to Kansas.
Why don't you stay out here?
New Mexico could use another good man and woman.
Yes, by all means.
What would I do out here?
You ran a store back in Kansas, didn't you?
We're opening a store and a bank, aren't we, John?
Rumor has it.
But we need a partner to manage them and oversee our legal affairs, don't we?
I don't think so. Not any longer.
Just one thing.
You are gonna keep your affairs legal, aren't you?
Hell, yes.
The three musketeers, eh?
All set, Mr. Chisum.
Two hitched to horses, the rest to mules.
Just like you said.
Here's the letter of credit for the merchandise.
- The bank in Santa Fe is expecting you.
- Right.
What about Garrett?
- I'll go see.
- Mind if I come along?
Come on.
The size of the pot.
What about you?
- Fold.
- You staying?
- Me, too.
- What about you, Mr. Garrett?
I'll stick around.
You better look out, Mr. Garrett.
I'm hotter than hell on a holiday.
Hi, Mr. Chisum. Care to sit in?
You figure to find that escaped prisoner in that deck of cards?
Don't worry, me and the boys will round him up.
Yeah, about the time you get your third set of teeth.
How about it, Pat?
You made up your mind?
This next card will make up my mind.
I'm playing these.
Big Casino.
I'm going.
Glad to have you with us, Big Casino.
Thanks, Little Casino.
I sure left that Garrett with a short bit.
I'm not so sure you won that hand.
Sure I did. I'm Big Casino.
Yeah, sure you did.
Giddyup!
What do you think?
I think it's a long way to Santa Fe and back.
You sure you know how to run one of these things?
All it takes is money.
Yeah. Mine.
Giddyup!
How long before the men get back from Santa Fe?
They better get here sooner than later.
We're running low on grub.
We're short on sugar, flour, airtights and everything else.
If they don't get here pretty soon, we'll be doing business with L.G. Murphy.
They'll be back in two or three days.
I heard the men talking about him...
- and they said that he...
- Who?
Billy Bonney.
They say he killed a man when he was 12 years old.
He's killed over a dozen men since.
That's what they say.
He's got such gentle eyes.
I don't believe all those stories are true.
It's time for supper.
Well?
- Well, what?
- Well, what are we gonna do?
We're gonna have supper.
One of you the Sheriff?
Nope. Deputies Morton and Baker.
Sheriff's inside.
Get him.
Sheriff?
- What's up?
- Nothing's up.
There's a dodger on him.
I'll collect the bounty.
Who is it?
It's Riker.
Deader than a can of corned beef.
- You just had to kill him.
- No. Less trouble that way.
Get that mess off the street.
You know that gimp?
I know of him. His name's Dan Nodeen.
Half-crazy bounty hunter.
He gimps because of Billy the Kid.
Bonney put a bullet in him about two years back.
Mr. Nodeen, my name is Murphy.
You wouldn't be looking for a job?
My job's collecting rewards.
- Pat, can you read?
- Yup.
How far did you get in school?
Got through the grades, then the war broke out.
I never got to school much.
Much? Hardly at all.
But I can read now and do my sums.
Mr. Tunstall's been teaching me.
- He's a good man.
- Yeah, seems like.
What do you hear about me?
Billy, just to hear tell it made my ears bleed.
I reckon I've run with the worst of 'em.
Jess Evans, Clay Allison.
I'd say you're running with the best of 'em now.
- Chisum and Tunstall are good company.
- Yeah.
- You ever think on getting married?
- I been three years a buffalo hunter.
What's that got to do with getting married?
The smell.
- What smell?
- Death.
Buffalo hunters smell like old guts all the time.
I'm downwind of you, and I don't smell it.
I'm upwind and I smell it on you, Billy.
- What, old guts?
- Death.
Yeah, I see what you mean.
Can it ever go away, that smell?
Sure it can, Billy... with time, good company, and patience.
- You a patient man?
- Me?
I got the patience of an oyster.
- Take 'em across.
- Let's go!
All right, let's go shopping.
Horse wagon!
Get that horse wagon up there. Get on it!
Well, Doctor, how is he?
Considering he suffered a concussion, some broken ribs... swallowed a barrelful of water, he's all right.
- He's to stay in bed for a few weeks.
- Thanks.
Don't worry. I'll be by this evening.
Pepper, have Cass saddle my horse.
- He's already saddled.
- What do you intend to do?
- See a man about an ambush.
- That's not the way.
- It's my way.
- But your plan worked.
- We got the merchandise.
- And we got Murphy.
Murphy was in town during the raid with 100 witnesses.
He's surrounded by the law and by gunmen like Evans.
Henry's right. You're doing just what they want you to do.
What would you want me to do?
Stand and watch...
I don't propose we stand around.
I'm going to Santa Fe to see the Governor.
Axtell? He's a gutless wonder.
But he'll act under pressure.
I'll tell him everything that's going on.
Justice Wilson will be here soon.
- You said he was a good man.
- Yes, he is.
Don't do anything to make it harder for him.
True, we wouldn't want him to have to try you for shooting somebody.
Might be a pleasure.
We'll open up the store and the bank... and we'll hit Murphy where it hurts.
Legally, without any more gunfire.
Right will prevail. I know it will.
Yes, Henry, right will prevail, one way or another.
But I guess we'll try your way first.
I'll leave as soon as we put the store in order.
Give me that scattergun.
- You mean, you're gonna...
- Not gonna.
- Not gonna.
- Not gonna.
Get us all killed is what'll happen...
Lawrence!
- I was just coming to talk to you.
- Talk.
- Know what I've been doing lately?
- No, what?
Playing solitaire, that's what.
Ever since they opened that store.
Look at it.
The banking hasn't been too good, either.
Look at those people. Pouring in and out like they're giving away free whiskey.
Yeah, I can see.
You know what I think?
You go back and play solitaire.
I'll do the thinking.
Jess!
I finished it, Billy.
Thinks he's some kind of a war hero, or something like Davy Crockett.
- What?
- Nothing.
Talking to himself more every day.
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.
Nothing? I heard you say something.
You wasn't talking to yourself, was you?
It's a sign your saddles are starting to slip when a man starts talking to himself.
I said, "Why don't you answer the door?"
I know you said something. I ain't deaf.
- Well, Mr. Peaceful himself.
- Hello, Pepper.
- John.
- Henry.
- All set to go?
- All set.
Thought I'd pop by and say cheerio, and see how William's doing.
- Good.
- He's doing his best.
- What did you say?
- I said he's getting plenty of rest.
- He's awake now. You can go on in.
- Thank you.
- How's the patient, Sallie?
- A little impatient, I'm afraid.
- He's getting bored.
- I'm just fine.
A little buzzing in my head, but other than that...
- There is a little hurt when I move.
- Other than that, he's just fine.
I stopped by to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Yes, I'm going to Santa Fe for a bit, to take care of some business.
As soon as I'm able, I got some business to take care of in Lincoln... with Murphy and Evans.
William, you are not going to do anything.
From now on, we do everything according to the law.
- Mr. Chisum go along with that?
- He does.
You've made a fresh start here, and you've got a good future.
I want you to promise me that you won't do anything to jeopardize it.
You're gonna make me swear on the Bible?
No, lad. Your word's always been good enough for me.
I thought perhaps you'd like to practice your reading some more while I'm gone.
Well, thanks. I would.
I'll see you soon, laddie.
- Mr. Tunstall.
- Yeah?
I promise.
I've written a little inscription on the inside.
"To William Bonney.
"February 18, 1878.
"Prepare your heart to seek the law of the Lord...
"and to live by it.
"J. Henry Tunstall."
- Good trip, Mr. Tunstall.
- Thank you, Pepper.
I want to thank you for taking care of William.
Not me, Sallie.
She's a wonderful girl.
And he's a worthwhile lad.
According to you, everybody's worthwhile.
God's children, John.
But William reminds me of someone.
- A black sheep in the family, no doubt.
- No, a young chap I never even talked to.
Years ago in England, this young man, like William... killed a man in some senseless brawl.
And I watched that young man walk to the gallows.
And I saw him hanged.
Ghastly sight.
There was nothing I could do to help that young lad.
- I hope your way works, Henry.
- It will, John. It will.
Would you like to listen to my opinion,
Mr. John Simpson Chisum?
Nope.
My opinion is all this speechifying, store-keeping, prayer-meeting... don't amount to a spit in the river.
Only one thing's gonna make this territory know who's the bull of the woods.
And sometime or sooner, it's gonna happen. And you know it.
- Do I?
- You do.
It's just gonna be you and Murphy, head to head, and horn to horn.
And one hell of a fight.
But one of you has got to lose.
So, the other one walks away with the herd and the whole shebang.
Now, that's my opinion.
What's so funny?
That's the first time I ever put somebody else's brand on our own cows.
There's your proof, Sheriff.
No-good cow thief putting his brand on my cattle.
I expect we ought to do something about that.
Yeah, I expect we ought to.
And you'd better hurry. He's leaving town.
All right, you two, go fetch him.
Hold Tunstall in jail until I get back.
- Where are you going?
- Santa Fe.
I've got to see a friend.
Hello.
Say, Tunstall, you're a hard man to track down.
- Thought you could get away?
- Get away with what?
We're deputy sheriffs, you know?
Duly appointed.
My congratulations.
But what's that got to do with me?
Got to do with your rustling
Mr. Murphy's cattle.
Gentlemen, in the first place... the origin of Mr. Murphy's magic herd is a bit dubious. In the second place...
In the second place, don't give us that fancy foreign talk, Mr. Fancy-pants.
The law says you're going back to Lincoln.
Look here, I'm going to Roswell.
I've got a stage to catch.
- He didn't even have a gun.
- He had a gun... and he tried to use it.
"And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying:
"'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
"'Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.
"'Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
"'Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness...
"'for they shall be filled.
"'Blessed are the merciful, for they shall experience mercy.
"'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
"'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of the Lord.
"'Blessed are the persecuted for righteousness' sake...
"'for they shall inherit heaven.
"'Rejoice and be doubly blessed...
"'for your reward in heaven is great.'
"The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.
"Blessed be the name of the Lord."
Amen.
- John.
- J.B.
- How'd it happen?
- It happened.
- Judge, my name is Alex McSween.
- Yes?
- I think we should go to the courthouse.
- Mr. McSween...
I think we'd better go with him.
I made you a promise, Mr. Tunstall.
Now I'm making myself a promise.
It says in the Bible:
"The candle of the wicked shall be put out."
Sheriff, I'm gonna ask you just once more.
- South.
- Chew it finer.
Valverde, I think.
Now, let's just hold up a minute.
As a Federal Justice...
I'm issuing warrants for the arrests of both of those men.
- Sheriff, are you going after them?
- My own men?
All right. John, I'm empowering you and your men to bring back those two...
- What are their names?
- Morton and Baker.
Deputies Morton and Baker... dead or alive.
- I'm afraid of what he might do.
- Whatever he does, it'll be legal.
That's hard to believe.
Jess Evans rode up right after the shooting.
The man is a thief. He stole my cattle.
We have the hides to prove it.
It's hard to believe about Henry Tunstall.
Yes, and it's hard to believe he carried a gun. But he did.
He pulled one. Resisted arrest.
The deputies were defending themselves.
They had no choice.
That's too bad.
- It's just too bad.
- Yes, it is.
We have more important things to think about, all of us.
Would you excuse us, Jess?
- I'll see you at the hotel.
- Sure. Governor.
All right, Lawrence.
Let's get to our business.
Howdy. Looks like you rode far.
Haven't seen two men that look like they'd rode just as far... a day or two ahead of us, have you?
- Fed up their horses here yesterday.
- Where'd they go?
Where else?
Thanks.
Draw.
Please draw.
- Mr. Chisum, I ain't trying to...
- Where's Morton?
Second room.
Bring him along.
Hold it up.
- I didn't do it, Mr. Chisum, he did.
- Shut up, Baker.
Pat.
You're gonna shoot us, ain't you?
I thought about it.
Then I thought about something
Henry Tunstall once said.
He watched a man walk to the gallows.
Saw him hang.
Said it was ghastly.
I've seen men hang.
And that's the word: Ghastly.
You two are gonna hang.
Pat, take 'em on in to Lincoln.
We'll swing by the ranch and pick up the judge.
Let's go.
Hello, Pat, Charlie, Tom.
- You shouldn't be up and around, Billy.
- Neither should they.
They won't be for long.
- What's gonna happen to 'em?
- They're gonna be tried and hanged.
- And you believe that?
- John Chisum does.
We'll see.
Pat, I never did thank you for hauling me out of that river.
- You ought to go back and rest, Billy.
- I will, Big Casino.
- First I gotta keep my promise.
- What promise?
So long, Charlie, Tom!
It was the Kid.
He rode up smiling and talking, and whopped me on the head.
All right, cut 'em loose.
And gather up some artillery.
I'm forming a posse.
Hey, Sheriff Brady!
Damn.
- The Governor is not to be disturbed.
- He'll be disturbed, all right.
Wake up, Sam. Listen to me.
- But, sir...
- Be quiet, will you?
Wake up, Sam. Listen to me.
Good God! Lawrence! What happened?
Just got a telegram from Lincoln.
Get rid of that damn fool, will you?
- What?
- Him!
It's all right, George.
Now, what in heaven's name happened?
The Kid just killed Brady,
Morton, and Baker... and escaped while Chisum and
Justice Wilson stood and watched him.
I can't believe it.
Sam, Brady, Morton, and Baker believe it.
Believe me, you're in the firing line.
You better do something... before President Hayes decides you can't handle this territory.
What do you suggest that I do?
First, Justice Wilson is Chisum's friend.
So revoke his powers.
You've got plenty of grounds.
All right.
I'll do that.
What else?
You good people witnessed the cowardly and cold-blooded murder... of our beloved Sheriff Brady by Billy "the Kid" Bonney, right there.
Governor Axtell has appointed a new Sheriff: Dan Nodeen.
He's offered a $200 reward for the Kid.
And I'm adding a further reward... of $1,000, dead or alive.
The Sheriff has formed his posse.
Have you got anything you want to add to that, Sheriff?
Just this.
I'm gonna bring Bonney in.
You people can either help me, or stay the hell out of my way.
John, since Governor Axtell hung me out to dry... there's nothing I can help you with.
- I'll head back to Mesilla in the morning.
- All right, J.B.
I'm writing President Hayes a letter asking for an impartial investigation...
By that time, Murphy'll have his name on everything between Arizona and Texas.
Mr. Murphy... just how much of Lincoln County are you after?
Mr. Chisum came out here several years ago... put his name on everything he could.
I've only been here a little while.
Just getting started.
You have anything to say to that,
Mr. Chisum?
I don't favor talking to vermin, but I'll talk to you just this once.
You're not just getting started.
The line's been drawn.
What Billy did balanced the books so far.
But if one of your men cross my land, or even touch one of my cows... or do anything to that store...
I'm not going to the Sheriff, the Governor, or the President of the United States.
I'm coming to see you.
Mr. Chisum, that sounds like a threat.
Wrong word: Fact.
Billy, why did you come back?
All of Lincoln County's looking for you.
They ain't gonna find me.
Leastways till I find Murphy and Evans.
You killed those men.
Mr. Tunstall was the first man ever to treat me decent.
He never hurt nobody.
I'm gonna get anybody who had anything to do with it.
- They'll kill you.
- They'll try.
- Pat, what're you doing?
- Maybe he wants the reward.
You know Pat Garrett better than that.
Look, Pat, you saved my life... and I'm sorry I had to clout you.
But don't go pulling a gun on me.
Get Mr. Chisum, Sallie.
Put it down, Pat.
You two walk away.
Come on in here, Billy.
I know how you feel, but... you've gone about it the wrong way.
- It's what you'd have done 25 years ago.
- Billy, all you've done is bollix things up.
The Governor's appointed another Murphy man sheriff.
So?
- You can't go around killing all the sheriffs.
- I can't?
- You know how this thing's gonna end.
- It's my life.
But you're affecting the lives of a lot of other people.
Are you talking about a lot of people, or Sallie?
Maybe it funnels down to her, too.
She reminds me of...
There was a girl once... back in Texas.
A long time ago.
I knew that the best thing for me to do was to turn my back.
Let her marry a man that'd make her happy.
You're talking about Garrett now.
I'm talking about a man that could make her happy.
I get your meaning, Mr. Chisum.
I'm not gonna turn you in, Billy.
But I'm telling you this:
Don't ever show up on my land again.
All right, Mr. Chisum.
I'll ride.
I didn't intend that you should hear that.
I'm glad I did.
Helps me understand a lot of things.
- Your father was a good man.
- Yes, he was.
I know you did what you thought was right for all of you... and that's what you're doing now.
Maybe you should have let Mother make her own choice.
She did.
She made the right choice.
So will I.
I know you will, Sallie.
Don't lie to me, you pepper gut.
But I swear to you, señor, we haven't seen him.
He hasn't been here at all.
If he comes here, or rides by, you get to town and tell me.
'Cause if I hear he even passed this way without you telling me about it... you're going to jail.
You understand?
Sí, Señor Sheriff.
Knock a lot of horseshoes loose in them rocks... and all for nothing.
That Nodeen.
Sure is hell-bent on catching you, Billy.
I should've killed him when I had the chance down in Guadalupe.
Murphy must want you pretty bad to put up $1,000 for your hide.
It's gonna cost him more than that.
He ain't gonna get my hide.
- I'm gonna get his.
- Let's get started.
All right.
First off, we're gonna hit Murphy's bank and take his money.
He's got a safe as big as a barn.
- We'll blow it open.
- We'll need dynamite.
We'll get it.
We'll need some more men.
How many?
About half a dozen.
Men who know the layout of the bank, and can shoot their way out of town.
There's Brown, Scurlock.
Middleton's all right.
And while you're visiting the bank...
I'll be visiting Mr. Murphy.
I got 500 head of prime cattle penned up at the corral.
I want you and some of the boys to deliver 'em to Tucson.
You can leave...
- Did you find him?
- No.
What did you come back for?
Some of the horses went lame.
We'll start again tomorrow.
If you needed horses, you could've sent for 'em.
Listen, Murphy, I know my job.
Nobody said you don't.
Every time I take a step,
I think of Bill Bonney.
I'm gonna find him, and I'm gonna see him dead.
Yeah, sure, Sheriff.
Want to come to the saloon?
I'll buy all of you a drink.
I prefer my own bottle and my own company.
That man there, he's meaner than a gut-shot grizzly.
Well, that's what we need.
You men got your own bottles, or do you want to come in the saloon?
Hell, you know we're going in the saloon with you.
Fifty.
Whose move?
His.
It's turning cold.
Wind's from the north.
Comanches call it Tahnimara.
Lonely wind.
I wonder where you heard that.
You know, Pat... there have been a lot of stories about John Chisum.
About how wild he was.
Those were wild times.
I think, in some ways, the two of them are a lot alike.
Who?
Uncle John, Billy Bonney.
Don't you think they are?
Don't you?
Not in the important things.
Like what?
Mr. Chisum's changed with the times.
He doesn't like to let on, but he cares.
About the people here and in town.
About the Indians and the territory.
He's independent... and he likes to do things his own way, but he cares.
And Billy doesn't?
I guess he can't help it.
But you heard him, all he cares about is getting those men.
In a way, doesn't it amount to the same thing?
No.
Billy wants revenge.
Mr. Chisum wants justice.
There's a big difference.
And there's a big difference between love and infatuation.
What about Pat Garrett?
Pat Garrett hasn't talked so much since Sunday School recitation.
I better get you in.
Johnny!
The rest of you take the horses around the side, and leave ours here.
Who's there?
Who is it? Who's down there?
It's me, Mr. McSween.
Billy?
What are you doing now, stealing from your friends?
No, sir. Not exactly.
We just need the loan of a little dynamite.
- Dynamite?
- Yeah.
- Don't you think you've done enough?
- No, sir.
But I'm going to.
Bonney.
Billy, listen to me.
I've written a letter to the President.
There will be an investigation.
This whole thing is a travesty.
I promise you...
I don't know what travesty means, but I made a promise, too.
Evans.
- What do you want?
- Get up!
Come on, get up!
Alex, is everything all right? I heard...
Billy.
Honey, everything is all right.
You go on back upstairs.
It's okay, ma'am.
We just need some supplies.
At this hour?
Sue, go back upstairs.
Get inside!
There's a mess of 'em out there.
Hold your fire!
Bonney, can you hear me?
Sheriff Nodeen!
Good morning, Sheriff!
No, it ain't, Bonney. Not for you.
There are 100 guns out here.
Hey, Nodeen, the McSweens have got no part of this.
They ain't done nothing, so let 'em come out!
Anybody that comes out of there while it's still dark... gets cut in half!
You ain't got no place to go, Bonney.
What do we do, Billy?
Pile something up against the windows.
Nothing else we can do right now.
Nothing's gonna happen till daylight.
Bonney!
Sheriff Nodeen again!
Time's up!
He's mad.
Must not have had any breakfast.
You know what's gonna happen to you if you don't surrender!
I know what'll happen if I do!
I'll get a bullet in the back trying to escape!
Here's what you're gonna get if you stay in there!
Damn place is built like a fort.
What'll it be, Bonney?
Billy, we've got to get Sue out of here.
Sheriff, this is McSween.
Is Lawrence Murphy out there?
I'm here.
Lawrence, let my wife come out.
Then we can talk.
I give you my word, there'll be no tricks.
All right, Alex.
She can come out.
It'll look better this way, Sheriff.
We don't want any women getting killed.
No, Alex.
Not unless you come, too.
I want to speak on behalf of these men, then I'll be right out.
You go on ahead, Sue.
All right, she's coming out!
Lawrence?
Will you send word to Fort Stanton and let these men surrender to the Army?
Look, Mr. McSween... you're not talking for us.
I'm trying to help you... to keep you alive.
The Army has no jurisdiction here.
This is a civil matter... and if anyone surrenders, it's to me.
Better get out of here...
'cause I ain't ever gonna surrender to Nodeen.
- Billy!
- Go out there with your wife.
Sheriff...
I'm unarmed, and I'm coming out alone!
No, you ain't! Not alone.
Not till everybody throws down their guns... and you all come out together... with Bonney in the lead!
Them's my terms.
Sheriff, my husband's done nothing wrong.
Your husband is harboring a killer.
- Mr. Murphy...
- I'm sorry. I can't interfere with the law.
- What about it, Bonney?
- I'm not coming out, Nodeen.
- Please!
- Get out of here before you get hurt.
Mr. McSween, it's your wife.
She's going for Chisum!
Exactly, we'll fight him on our own ground.
Get some men by the river in case they come in that way... and throw a barricade across that street.
We're running short of lead.
Mr. McSween.
All right.
Here's the key to the room.
Upstairs!
Women and children off the street!
Hold it!
- Damn it! Where are you going?
- Going to warn the noon stage.
Noon stage, my...
There's enough ammunition there to fight a war.
That's what we're doing.
Mr. Chisum!
You have to get Alex.
They're gonna kill him.
Murphy and Nodeen's men have the store surrounded.
Billy's in there.
- Please, Mr. Chisum.
- Take care of her, Sallie.
- What're you gonna do?
- What I'd have done 25 years ago.
Pat, get the men out of South Camp.
Trace, you round up everybody that can ride a horse or pull a trigger.
- Let's break out some Winchesters.
- You bet.
Come on, hurry up.
It's my arm.
Give up, Billy.
We're ready for him now.
Billy, they've got the street blocked off!
It ain't to keep us in.
- It's to keep somebody out.
- Chisum.
We'll be slaughtered.
- I'm going out there and talk to Murphy.
- No! Don't do it, Mr. McSween!
Don't go out there!
Sheriff, Murphy... hold your fire!
I've got to talk to you... and I'm coming out alone.
Don't, Mr. McSween!
You heard my terms!
Get some torches!
I'll burn the son of a bitch out.
Señor Chisum, they built a barricade.
We could go around and come in from behind.
We'd have to cross that river.
We'd be sitting ducks.
Then what do we do, Mr. Chisum?
We do exactly what we started out to do,
Mr. Pepper.
It's Chisum!
Let's pour it in him.
To hell with this.
You wanted him on your own ground.
You got him.
- Good to see you, Big Casino.
- Yeah.
Cover me, Pat.
Billy.
Ain't like old times...
Billy.
Can you make it?
What? Where's...
Where are you going?
I resign.
No more paydays around here.
I know.
It's my fault.
You were the primer, Billy... but I guess, sooner or later, the lid had to blow off.
Sheriff left town.
He won't be hard to follow.
- So long, Mr. Chisum.
- Let it go, Billy.
That smell of death.
Remember?
Be seeing you, Big Casino.
Are you coming?
"General Lew Wallace takes oath as new governor of territory.
"Garrett appointed
Sheriff of Lincoln County.
"Governor declares A-M..."
Amnesty.
Yeah.
Do that mean the war is over?
- It do.
- I hope so.
I wouldn't be too sure.
There's an old saying, Miss Sallie:
"There's no law west of Dodge, and no God west of the Pecos."
Right, Mr. Chisum?
Wrong, Mr. Pepper.
'Cause no matter where people go, sooner or later, there's the law.
And, sooner or later, they find that God's already been there.
Now, where's he going?
Don't worry. He'll be back.
I better get going.
Got some things in Lincoln to take care of.
Lincoln can take care of itself until after the dishes are done.
- Doesn't this badge give me any authority?
- Not in this house.
Hold it!
Jim, if you wanna stay alive, you'd better be more careful.
Chris, I've been on the trail a long time.
- I've been lookin' for ya.
- Well, we'd better get you into town.
Come on.
I'm scared, Ma. I'm really scared.
I'm not excusing it, ma'am. He did wrong.
But the punishment don't fit the crime.
He's only 18.
Only a boy.
- What did you do?
- I was just funnin'. Busted into a store.
Help us, please, ma'am.
Talk to your husband.
Save your tears, señora.
The marshal has no mercy, no sympathy, no compassion.
- What did he do?
- Pepe Carral?
He's knocked over most every bank in this territory.
And Big Walt over there, he's just too strong for his own brainpower.
Chris.
Chris.
No.
But he's only a boy.
He had a man's wants when he was robbin'.
And he didn't spend the money he stole on grub for his family.
He spent it on women, liquor and cards.
And then, when he's caught, he calls himself a boy again.
If you put him in that Tucson hellhole, he'll come out a wild animal.
That storekeeper you robbed has six kids.
You ruined him.
You wiped out ten years of hard work for just one night. One good time.
- I learned my lesson, honest.
- Chris, please.
No.
You're supposed to be an important man.
A friend of the governor's.
Why, you're worse than any man you ever sent to Tucson.
Is there any man in there that's killed as many men as you?
Not by half, there isn't.
I didn't kill for the same reasons they did.
You're not as pure as them that stands before you.
Name's Noah Forbes, Marshal.
I've decided to do for you what Ned Buntline did for Bill Cody.
- Make a damn fool of me.
- Make you famous.
You're a writer?
You name a big city newspaper and I've worked on it.
That means you're pretty good... or you can't hold a job.
All you have to do is talk to me.
I'll do the writing, you get a third.
I met Buntline.
Read his stuff. Mostly trash.
Things weren't anything like that.
Listen, what people think is true is a lot more important than what really is true.
Can't get rich telling 'em they're wrong.
I don't make my livin' that way.
Look, somebody's gonna write about you anyway. Why shouldn't it be me?
All right. But you get half.
And you don't print anything I don't like.
It's a deal.
Rye. Bring a bottle and put it on the marshal's bill.
I'll be a little short till I finish the book.
You better write good.
What are you doin' here? You should be flat on your back for a week.
I ain't got a week, Chris.
I ain't got an hour to spare.
Well, come on. Have a drink anyway.
Jim Mackay, Noah Forbes.
Here's a man you could write about.
- He's ridden with me more than once.
- Lawman, Mr Mackay?
- I used to be a bounty hunter.
- One of the few that brought 'em in alive.
But I'm a lawman now.
And don't you laugh, Chris.
A legal and respectable town marshal.
They've got a good man. What town?
Magdalena, down Sonora way.
It's a farmin' settlement.
Mostly Mexican. A few American families.
We get along just fine.
An American marshal in a Mexican town.
They couldn't be too particular.
They needed help bad.
You see, we border De Toro's territory.
Who's De Toro?
Bandit. Raids both sides of the border.
The cavalry and the rurales could stop him if they'd cooperate...
...but neither side lets the other cross the frontier.
Those two pistoleros. De Toro's?
I guess they figure I'm comin' to look for some of the old bunch.
Jim, I've crossed that border three times to fight bandits.
- I ain't goin' down there again.
- Chris, he's bound to hit us any time.
He's got 50, 60 men.
I got a handful of farmers.
And I've got a good job.
And a new wife who's still practically a bride.
I don't like to bring this up, Chris, but I saved your life one time.
That doesn't give you any right to ask for it now.
Besides, didn't I save your neck today?
Doesn't that make us even, if you're keepin' score?
You told me then, Chris, "I owe you.
You want something, you ask, you got it."
I hung on to that promise for ten years.
I saved it like grubstake...
...waitin' for something important to come along, and I'm askin' now.
No, Jim. I can't.
Remember that first time, Chris?
Seven of us got $350. $50 apiece.
Well, those folks in Magdalena, they trust me. Me, Chris, with everything they got.
I got $3,000 here. One thousand of it's yours for just a couple of weeks' work.
Well, maybe some of the others.
Dead, mostly. Or semiretired, like me.
Skinner or Elliot?
Tucson prison.
Who brought 'em in, Chris?
Times change, Jim.
They couldn't accept it.
Yeah, well.
I guess I don't neither.
Luck, Chris.
Luck.
I'm glad you didn't lock it.
I figured you'd break it down if I did.
Chris.
He's only 18.
Hickok, Clay Allison, the Daltons...
...how do you figure I outlived them?
By knowing when not to take unnecessary chances.
Now, that's hard, but it's the only way that works.
Works against who?
I mean, Shelly's no
Mark Skinner or Pepe Carral.
I'm not asking you to help gunfighters.
Judge Parker said to me once:
"The men I hanged never killed again, but plenty that I didn't hang did."
You tell me he's wrong.
He wasn't talking about a boy who robbed a store.
I've buried a lot of friends who thought fuzzy-faced kids weren't dangerous.
Means a lot to you, huh?
I don't owe Shelly a damn thing and I do him a big favour.
I owe Jim Mackay a lot, and I don't do anything for him.
I can't seem to do anything right.
Sure you can.
Come on.
Chris, how come
I'm in chains and Walt isn't?
He promised not to get away.
- And you believed him?
- Yeah, I believed him. Come on.
(Chris) Hold it.
I'm sorry, Chris, but these irons spoil my aim.
- (Chris) Hello, Skinner.
- I'll see you next time I bust out.
I'll be here.
Beats me where he hid it. He learns hard.
- Forget about it.
- If you say so.
All right, bring 'em on.
Hold it. Wait a minute. Leave him.
Shelly.
You go on home. And stay out of trouble.
Hold it, Marshal.
I got an order to bring him in.
You had an order. Go on, get.
Yaah!
Come on.
(Skinner) Bust him, Pepe.
Damn you, Chris!
You give everybody a break but me!
(Skinner) Kill the bastard.
That lousy kid doesn't deserve letting off!
(Pepe) I'll kill you.
I will, Chris.
- I'll kill you.
- Not if I get to him first.
Pepe.
Thanks.
A glass of water.
I put this on your bill.
You can play me for things that aren't important.
Just don't try it with anything that is.
I already figured that out for myself.
Wanna get some work done?
OK, the battle of Adobe Walls.
What was that like?
Well, there were 28 of us.
Bat Masterson, me,
Billy Dixon, one woman.
Rest of 'em were buffalo hunters.
Quanah Parker had
600 Comanches with him.
28 against 600. Yeah, that's great.
What happened?
We had a hell of a fight.
And?
We won.
Waah!
Boy, when I saw that wagon pullin' out without me...
...I never felt so good in all my life.
All the way over, my feet kept saying
"You're free, free, free!"
To do what? Go back to the same life that made you risk Tucson in the first place?
You're no better off than you ever were, Shelly.
- Do you feel like comin' home for lunch?
- Yes.
If you think you're gonna follow us home, forget it.
OK. I'll run over to the restaurant.
You run a bill there too, don't ya?
Shelly, no!
No, Chris.
No! No!
- Any more shooting'll hit her.
- Get up.
- No.
- Get up. Come here.
You're gonna be all right, huh?
Hell, I already wrote your epitaph, had the governor comin' to your funeral.
Thanks.
Well, she nursed you, Chris.
She hasn't slept in 48 hours.
Where's Arrila?
They, uh... took her.
Oh, God.
I guess he just couldn't stand the farm.
(woman) What are you going to do?
Kill them.
Hey, don't die just ridin' along.
That'd be a real anticlimax.
On the other hand, we could say you left your deathbed, just died on the trail.
That has a real good ring to it.
How far you figure we've come?
100 miles?
I tell you, it feels more like a thousand.
Damn it, my ass hurts.
How can anything stuffed with hay be this hard?
There's somethin' down there.
It looks like hers.
It's a tough climb, Chris. I'll go.
Dead?
Don't go, Chris. Don't.
Did they use her?
Raped, killed and left for the buzzards.
Hank? Hank, you usin' all your blankets?
I'm cold. I'm damned cold.
Go to sleep.
- Thought we was outta coffee.
- We are.
Get up.
Do you want it lyin' there or on your feet?
Marshal, please. You gotta understand.
We've been gettin' up before light since we was five.
Work all day then go to sleep because we couldn't afford kerosene.
Was we wrong wantin' to get away?
Wantin' to get away wasn't wrong.
It's how you did it that was wrong.
Now, where's Shelly?
Find him yourself.
You're a lawman.
You gotta take us in to trial.
He won't shoot us in cold blood. I don't bluff.
Where's Shelly?
- He cut out. For Mexico.
- When?
Right after we left town.
Your wife... that was Hank.
I had nothin' to do with it.
I didn't even watch.
And you didn't help her.
He's my brother.
Him for what he did...
...and you for what you didn't do.
You coulïve taken 'em back.
Do you have any doubt they were guilty?
If I waited around for what you ask,
Shelly's trail'd go cold.
It still wasn't right.
Chris!
Chris! Up here!
(Jim) I knew you wouldn't let me down.
Have you seen a young fella ridin' past here in the last few days?
Blond, about five ten,
18 years old, maybe?
Yeah, yesterday. I tried to hire him, but he was in a hurry.
- Chris, De Toro's on the rampage.
- As usual.
And I got nothin' behind me but a pack of good intentions. Farmers, shopkeepers.
Them two I hired yesterday. Paid 'em less than I offered you and they ain't worth it.
As for the rest, I guess they're willin' enough to get killed, but I need killers.
- That why you thought of Chris?
- Didn't mean it the way it come out.
Before De Toro hits, Jim, you'd better ride outta here.
Stayin's suicide.
That ain't gonna do you no good.
- Would you ride out?
- I wouldn't be in this mess to begin with.
Lemonade. Unsweetened.
It helps fight the thirst.
Thanks.
You make a hell of a posse man,
Padre. Where's your gun?
- I told him he didn't have to wear one.
- Not that I would have, anyway.
I fight a different battle.
I use different weapons.
This is De Toro's kind of a battle.
You're not impressed with my congregation?
They've been welded together by adversity.
In many ways, I've already won my biggest battle.
- God works in strange ways.
- He's got me confused most of the time.
When we first came to Magdalena, we only felt the differences between us.
Now he's taught us and bound us together.
Well, under the circumstances,
I'm not sure he's done you any favours.
You realise you're likely all to be dead soon?
If that's his will, we're ready to die.
I'm not too worried about meeting him.
Somehow, I'm not so sure you won that exchange.
I'm not so sure he did either.
If your whole posse is made up of tigers like him, you're in bad trouble.
- Aren't you bein' a little tough on him?
- No tougher than De Toro's gonna be.
Where does that leave me?
Alone.
Chris.
Good luck.
- (Chris) Shelly's in a mighty big hurry.
- (Noah) Let's go.
- De Toro?
- Yeah.
It looks like Shelly's joined 'em. Come on.
Hey, take it easy.
We're liable to catch up with him!
That's how Shelly bought into the gang.
That's where Mackay set up his ambush.
- Shelly's led him right in behind 'em.
- Damn it to hell. Come on.
(Noah) You're not going down there, are you?
(Chris) Come on.
(Noah) I don't see Mackay.
Maybe he took your advice and lit out.
(Chris) I didn't think he would.
I don't know whether I'm glad or not.
Sure been a lot of killin' since I met you.
Well, shall we bury 'em?
The livin' need us more.
There can't be anything left in their town but the women... and De Toro.
I guess they took off.
There's one by the cantina. Another in the door of the mission, coverin' us.
Ease off your saddle.
Keep your horse between you and the mission.
Right.
¡Manos arriba!
Noah! It's safe now.
Are you sure?
- (door opens)
- (women sobbing)
Chris.
Thank you.
I'm Laurie Gunn.
Uh, Miss or Mrs?
Mrs. I mean, uh...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let her cry. She'll feel better.
Here.
I'm Noah Forbes. Call him Chris.
Jim Mackay talked about you.
He said you would come and help.
Only you got here too late.
How are the other women?
Oh, God. I just hope none of us gets pregnant.
Can you tell me about it?
There are only 17 of us women.
And, uh... De Toro came riding in here with about 40... 50 men.
He... he told us that he had found our men in the hills.
And that he had killed them all.
Did he say where he was goin' from here?
Did he say when he'd be back?
I think they were going to Texas.
They'll stop here on their way home.
Probably take you back with him.
That's what he said.
- Most of the others are asleep.
- Oh, Madge.
- When could you take us away?
- We'll round up horses in the morning.
- But they took them all away.
- We can walk.
Walk? Across the desert?
- You'll all die the first day out.
- At least it's a chance.
Look, De Toro can ride 20 miles while you're walking one.
If he catches you out in the open, he'll just butcher you.
- We'll go for help.
- Where?
The rurales can't do anything.
The US troops can't cross the border.
Volunteers won't come here and fight
De Toro. Mackay's already tried it.
- What are you saying?
- There must be something.
- I'm open for suggestions.
- If they come back here, I'll kill myself.
Damn you! Think of something.
Maybe I can get a few men tough enough to match De Toro.
(Noah) Where?
Tell me everything you know about him.
What's he like? How he acts? Everything.
Well, uh...
The first thing you notice about him are... his eyes.
They tell you that he's mad.
Crazy mad.
- Come on. Let's go.
- You better eat somethin'.
You won't get a chance again for quite a while.
Hey, this isn't like with Mackay?
We're not gonna cut out on 'em?
No, or I'd have told 'em so they could make other plans.
Suddenly it is not so bad, huh?
- What?
- Me bein' a killer.
No, it's turned out to be quite useful.
There's somethin' else. We don't have to go lookin' for Shelly now.
He's gonna come ridin' in with De Toro. Come on.
- You will come back?
- Yeah.
Suppose they come back before you do?
Just pray they don't.
Stop worryin'. We'll be back.
(Chris) I knew he wouldn't run.
Shelly. Mackay killed him.
The women need you anyway.
You gotta help 'em, Chris.
You promised.
He did my job.
I'll do his.
- I don't think this is quite legal.
- I don't care what you think.
The governor's approved it. He's the boss.
- I won't turn these men loose.
- You're not turnin' 'em loose.
You're paroling them in my custody.
It don't seem right, turning 'em loose to do the very things...
...they were put in here for doing in the first place.
Marshal, I think you oughta know.
They're not quite so tough any more.
- I had to do a bit of taming.
- You didn't tame 'em, you broke 'em.
They weren't sent here for a vacation.
Pepe.
- Chris, I've been thinking about you.
- Have you?
You better believe it.
How's it goin', Walt?
- Answer!
- It's all right.
It's not all right.
They're in my custody now.
Captain.
May I ask what you mean about us being in your custody now?
Can you still handle dynamite, Elliot?
Good.
- Still smiling, huh, Skinner?
- Only on the outside, Chris.
- Fast as ever?
- I wish you'd try me.
I've got pardons here, signed by the governor for each of you.
When I countersign 'em, you'll be free men.
- Well, then, sign 'em.
- You're gonna earn 'em first.
- How?
- Join a posse I'm leadin'.
- Go to hell.
- All right, put him back in his cell.
Hey, wait a minute.
All right, Chris.
- Whatever you say.
- Who are we going after?
- Juan De Toro.
- Into Mexico?
Pardons, hell. That's seven against 70.
You're takin' us in there to get killed.
The odds are long. Pay's good.
But there is one hitch.
If I get killed by you, by accident or by De Toro's bunch...
...the governor will assume that you did it.
And he'll come trackin' you down and hang every one of you.
But we'll be in Mexico.
All right, who wants to go?
(Chris) Walt?
Get the chains off of 'em.
Right face. March!
You fool. Can't you see what they're thinking?
They'll let you lead them into Mexico, then blow your head off and join De Toro.
I'm sure that's exactly what they're thinkin'.
- That's all we're taking?
- Yeah.
- Let's get more men.
- Seven's always been my lucky number.
Damn it, couldn't you have waited till you got farther away from here?
Take 'em.
Here's a double for you, Skinner.
Well, you only need one if you're really good.
Figured you'd like to have that.
Didn't think you'd want one.
Well, I haven't been in a situation like this lately.
Well, don't blow your foot off.
- Who's the dude?
- He takes notes.
He's gonna write all about you.
All right, when you're ready, mount up.
Elliot. You're gonna drive the wagon.
Hear you had a little trouble.
A few of the boys cut me some.
Did they have good cause?
They thought so. Warden made me take charge of a work detail.
Had to build up a new cellblock.
And you built it solid?
Well, you'll be buildin' again.
- Stone or brick?
- Barbed wire this time.
Hayes.
At your trial you promised you were gonna blow my brains out.
- That was the mood of the moment.
- I picked you...
...because I need a man who knows battles.
Not gunfights. Battles.
Let's cut through it, Chris.
I'm out and I'm not goin' back.
- You can depend on me.
- I hope so.
(Chris) Let's go.
Let's ride in the rear.
I don't like havin' my back to 'em.
It don't matter. You won't be able to stop 'em once they make their move.
How long do you figure they'll wait?
This ain't a patient bunch.
This way. Come on.
Chris, this isn't the way to Magdalena. Where we goin'?
De Toro's stronghold.
- He's not there.
- If he was, we wouldn't be goin' there.
That's gotta be her.
De Toro's woman.
I hope De Toro's as proud of her as Laurie said.
Well, Laurie was wrong about one thing.
He's not completely crazy mad.
Let me see her.
I'll introduce her to you in time.
So how many... how many guards do you figure?
Enough to give you your share.
There's a hacienda just over that hill. There's a few risks.
But there's enough loot in there to give you all a fresh start.
- You're gonna help us rob a hacienda?
- You'll all be rich by mornin'.
- Rich?
- Why are you bein' so good to us?
I'm doin' no more for you than you'd do for me.
How in hell do you mean that?
- Like he says it.
- You on his side?
Kept that guard from busting me with that club again.
Why, you damn fool, he didn't do that for you.
He just knew if your ass was busted you couldn't ride a horse.
Was that the reason?
Not exactly.
Hold it. Chris, do you mean that we go in there and we can take anything we want?
That's exactly what I mean.
- All right, what's your plan?
- Oh, I figured we'd just ride in there...
...and shoot down anyone carryin' a gun.
Ah, that's sloppy.
Who's in the assault wave? Who are the reserves? You have to have flankers.
Suppose you get hit, who assumes command?
Uh, Noah.
- I've got better qualifications.
- Relax, Hayes.
Captain Hayes. I've ambushed Apaches.
Anything in this world is chilïs play after that.
He's got a good argument there.
All right, Hayes.
- You.
- You all heard that?
Yeah, we heard that.
Captain.
- All right, I'll work out some tactics.
- Hayes, you're a pain in the ass.
Yeah, but a useful one. Come on, let's go.
Pepe.
Here.
That Gatling gun, right up there.
Everybody else is getting a better deal than me again, eh, Chris?
- How come I get the worst job?
- Because you're the best with that.
Am I?
You cross me, Pepe, and you'll be killin' your friends too. Now get goin'.
They're no friends of mine.
Around there.
Walt, check out the stable.
Skinner, got a good one for you.
See those two right there?
Go get 'em.
Come on.
- Take that one alive.
- Yeah, we're just leadin' damn recruits.
We better give 'em a few more minutes to get in position.
Hey, amigo.
Pepe! Pepe!
Pepe!
- I'm gonna have to get around there.
- OK, I'll draw their fire.
Pepe! Where the hell are you?
Oh, hell.
Up here.
Come on.
Noah. Tie her up.
Gringo desgraciado.
Gracias.
Hayes, bring me the live one.
You speak English?
Now you go to De Toro and you tell him that I, Chris, degrade his woman.
Skinner.
And you tell him the names of the rest of the men that did this to him.
Pepe Carral. Walt Drummond.
And Andy Hayes.
Scott Elliot. Noah Forbes.
And Mark Skinner.
You got that?
And you tell him that we'll be waitin' for him, with his woman, at Magdalena.
Now get goin'.
Stop him!
- What the hell you doin', Chris?
- You old bastards.
You can't go back to the States cos they'll hang ya.
And you can't join De Toro because he'll cut your hearts out.
Now we're ready for Magdalena.
They're back! They've come back!
They've come back! They're back!
The marshal, he's come back!
I knew you'd be back.
I want her watched every minute.
She's De Toro's woman.
Martha, you watch her.
You, come on with me.
I said, come with me.
- Who are they?
- Volunteers.
They came to help us.
Why?
They're humanitarians.
Now get some food in your guts.
Then we'll go to work. Come on.
We'll serve everybody over in the cantina.
Bring what you have on the stove.
All right, we haven't got much time.
Will all the women get over against that wall? The men against the bar.
Now, we've got two days, three at the most, before they get here.
So we'll be working day and night.
You men'll be headin' work parties.
You'll also need the women to load guns for you in the fight. So pick your partners.
Try to make it mutual, huh?
No.
No.
- What about them?
- Keep pickin' till they're gone.
You women will be workin'...
...loadin' for your men, feedin' them, taking care of 'em.
And draw your own lines.
Now, let's unload that wagon.
Long-range target rifles? These are single-shots. We need repeaters.
Keep diggin'. And watch those sights.
They're Winchester rifles, calibre 30-40. Model 1885.
They're brand-new, Captain.
Get the grease out of 'em.
You'll be able to inspect them with white gloves.
OK, ladies, I want some boiling water to get rid of that grease.
Shotgun shells, 12-gauge, double-aught buckshot.
And official police riot guns.
You would get official police guns, wouldn't you, Chris?
Tell Pepe what you want.
I need you with me.
Come on, Pepe.
- Go to hell.
- Move.
And take your women with you.
And don't go empty-handed.
Laurie, I'm gonna need everything in town that can hold dirt.
Pillowcases, flour sacks, trouser legs.
- Get them to sow bags out of anything.
- All right, Chris.
All right, come on, construction foreman.
I'll show you why I brought you.
They'll have to come in over there. And we're gonna have to whittle 'em down.
Now, those target rifles have got range, so we use those on the first line.
- How many do you think he'll have?
We'll dig a row of pits. Then we'll sight in the rifles and set out range sticks.
When they pass a stake, we'll know how far away they are and save misses.
Now, those pits'll go right in here.
Well, if his horses are coverin'
100 yards every five or six seconds...
...that means that he's gonna be here a minute after we open fire.
That should give us time for about three rounds.
With seven of us shootin', we should get about 15 to 20 of 'em. More or less.
Now, when they're about 300 yards away, we'll start fallin' back to the second line.
They're gonna be crawling all over us.
Well, then we'll have to do somethin' to stop 'em from crawlin' all over us.
Plant a series of charges in these pits.
That'll take care of about five more of 'em.
Chris, when we're retreating, you have to figure on the losses.
With all that lead flying, odds are they'll get a couple of us.
Well, then there'll be five or six of us at the second line.
Which five or six?
Then we'll make the Winchester line right here.
Same thing. Pits.
Well, if their charge is broken, they'll take cover.
And you can see where they'll go.
Those little gullies.
I'll plant charges in 'em.
You're both as crazy as De Toro.
What makes you think he'll do everything you want?
He'll charge the first line because he's got contempt for us.
Then, when he sees how few we are...
...it'll hurt his pride and make him charge the second line.
- Then what?
- Then he'll start being careful.
- And flank us.
- Yeah.
By then, we should have a third to half his men, and only lost a few of us.
I wish you'd stop sayin' that.
- They'll be comin' in from all sides.
- I'll figure out some stuff. Wires, charges.
- Strong as you can.
- What happens when they break in here?
We're gonna put the biggest charge under the altar in the mission.
And take those bastards with us.
- Come on. Time to eat.
- Nah, I gotta keep workin'.
Put the shovel down.
You gotta have somethin' to eat.
Gotta keep up all that strength.
- Is that enough?
- Almost.
Getting killed will at least bring us some rest.
If you can't handle it, Pepe, go to sleep.
They say if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it...
...there's a question of whether it makes any noise.
If none of us lives to tell about this...
...can we be covered in glory?
(Hayes) Sure we can.
Feels good to be buildin' again.
We've built good.
Not good enough, maybe, but... best we could.
I'm satisfied.
Enough money to last me my whole lifetime.
Clothes to turn any girl's eyes.
Women for the taking.
And I'll be dead before I can enjoy any of it.
¡Salud!
Chris, he really had me pegged, right from the first minute we met.
Said I couldn't hold a job.
Boy, he was just more right than he knew.
Well, he must have seen something else...
...or else he wouldn't have wasted his time on you.
Butterball, you are looking at a 14-carat sharpie.
A guy who's always known all the angles, none of the principles.
But you know a few, or else you wouldn't know the difference.
You're really determined to make me feel good, aren't ya?
Don't get angry, but we have enough real problems without you hashing over these.
That's just the point.
I have started knowing what's real.
For the first time, I know.
This thing, or any other story...
...I can tell it, cos I've learned how to feel it.
This trip with Chris has really taught me what I've always needed to know.
Now it's too damned late.
Noah said you never had any children.
Don't you like them?
Sure I like 'em. We get along just fine.
Come on.
Down you go.
He said your wife was very pretty.
Why was he talkin' so much about me?
Because I asked him.
Night-night.
Night.
What was your husband like?
Oh...
...you wouldn't have noticed him.
He didn't stand out very much in a crowd.
I don't mean that bad, like.
He was a good man.
Not much of a farmer.
And no fighter at all.
But he was good to me.
He loved them. I wasn't unhappy.
Why'd you marry him?
I... I'd rather talk about you.
Well, you've got enough answers and I don't have any.
He promised me a better life.
A place of our own.
He kept his promise.
Well, I'm a lousy farmer too.
- And I don't keep promises.
- Oh, of course you do.
You promised you'd come back and you did.
Well, I... I don't make a habit out of 'em.
If we get through this thing tomorrow...
...I ain't stickin' around here.
I know.
600. Lower the range.
Let's go!
¡Vámonos!
- (Walt groans)
- No!
They'll be comin' back and we won't be able to hold 'em!
Get the women outta here. Go on!
- Go.
- No!
¡Vámonos!
Come on!
Give it up, Pepe. Come on!
They're comin' back. Let's go.
(Chris) Anything?
From what I can count, we've got about half of 'em.
They got about half of us.
The odds are the same as when we started.
(Laurie) Everybody sit down.
Sit down.
Here. Come on.
- No, Chris. No! Please, no!
- Laurie, stop it!
You know this is the last resort.
Chris! Give her back to him.
Maybe he'll go away.
I would give her back to him.
But she's not important to him now.
He'd see her in hell before he'd let us get away with this.
Laurie...
...you'll have to decide for yourself...
...and do it or not.
I can't.
All right.
De Toro will let the children live, won't he?
I don't know what he'll do.
You told me yourself he was crazy mad.
Laurie.
They're fine kids.
Sorry.
He was a good man.
What was his name?
I... I never thought to ask.
It didn't seem important.
He... wasn't much for talkin'.
Walt.
Walt Drummond.
De Toro!
Oh, Chris.
Hey, Chris.
Where's my pardon?
This town needs a sheriff, Skinner.
- Interested?
- It ain't much of a town.
Three men and a passel of women and kids.
Well, the women are scarce in this part of the country. Men'll come.
Why not?
Chris. Did I ever tell you
I was born in Salt Lake?
I'm a Mormon.
(Madge) Noah.
(Chris) Guess I won't be comin' this way again.
The sheriff here is an old enemy of mine.
If you behaved yourself, you wouldn't get into any trouble.
- You put him up to that.
- I did not.
- The hell you didn't.
- It's just that they've grown used to you.
Yeah, well, kids pick up bad habits easy.
So do adults.
I ain't makin' no promises.
Who asked you to?
Skinner! You've just been demoted to deputy!
Yeah, well, that figures.
Wouldn't have had much time for work anyway.
He's wrong, Juanito.
He mustn't do it. Listen to me.
What did he say?
Juanito, as I told you before, there is too much violence in the world.
And beside that, there's another reason.
I don't want our friend Sabata to get hurt now.
But the Murdocks deserve to die, Padre
You know the Murdocks stole everything from us here.
- They should be punished.
- Juanito.
Have you forgotten what I taught to you?
You must try to forgive, not s nk nto revengo
- I know, Father.
- Go tell Sabata this.
He shouldn't risk his neck for those Murdock brothers.
Tell him our prayers are his.
He doesn't need to fight.
But as our Good Book often says,
"The Lord will provide."
Yes, Father.
I beg you to be careful, my son.
- The Lord be with you.
- The Lord is Sabata.
Too much violence.
Order arms!
Left face!
Forward march!
- 20 dollars.
- 10 dollars on the Murdocks.
Right.
100 dollars on the Murdock brothers.
Ain't nobody betting on the challenger?
- How about you, Ballantine?
- 100 dollars. On the black.
You can spare a dollar, can't you?
Just to keep this shut up, hm?
Black's my favourite colour, friends.
I always win on black.
It's best if we all get the hell out.
Might get a little hot.
I'm looking for a certain man for a special job. Sabata.
Not now Co m o o n
We're all set for you to go out in style.
Haven't you noticed?
Sabata! You better make him turn!
Hey! Begin the shooting when it stops.
Sabata likes them lying down.
Guess Murdock's nailed for good.
Know w h at m oa n?
- Huh?
- Ah.
Sorry.
That blasted bird needs oil. Here, you go do it.
- No oil, no money.
- Give me that, you little runt!
- Hey, the man you wanted...
- I think I can find him.
Let's go.
You know what Colonel Skimmel looks like.
How about it? Will you accept?
I hoped you'd be able to do this job for me.
Thank you.
Adiós
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you might need my help.
M ay go w t h yo u??
Ma ko very good tort as have a not h oryob for yo u
Deliver this to Father Mike.
Tell him that the Murdocks have found their... great reward...
...and wish to make a contribution.
Hello.
Well... how much did you make, Ballantine?
A mere bagatelle.
I'm here for something more important.
Colonel Skimmel.
We could... work together.
Hey, you!
We Austrians have eyes everywhere.
If you want some advice, forget about those Mexicans.
Oh!
Hey! Hey, what is this? Get me down!
You pig, you! Do you hear? Cut me loose!
I'll kill you for this, you dirty American dog!
I swear I'll make you pay, filthy Yankee!
Hang around. I'll be back.
You bastard, I'll get you when I'm down!
You play that rotten!
Reach that gate and you're a free man, subject to the colonel's marksmanship.
Give them a chance. Release two, three, four of them, altogether.
Long live the revolution!
We appreciate your aid, Garcia.
Colonel Skimmel will be most generous with you.
Garcia Moreno?
Ah, you did very well, dear Garcia.
You helped us expose this filthy revolutionary plot.
You also saved my life.
It has not been forgotten.
Our beloved emperor, Maximilian, and this humble soldier, are very grateful.
In the drawer under the model ship, you will find your 20 pieces of gold.
Thank you.
The key is there.
Open it.
- Perfect.
- Mm-hm.
As usual.

Jesus Rivalta!
Luis Miguel Cortejo.
They're all good men. Yours for the mission.
- I hope you approve.
- Aha.
European money.
Who bought you?
Did you sell out to that pig Skimmel?
He's a spy, Ocano.
Septiembre!
Stand back from the traitor.
Gitano!
Gitano!
The flamenco of death.
No!
Gitano and Septiembre are all the men I'll need.
That gold will buy us guns.
We'll get stronger than their soldiers and nobody can stop us then.
The man who'll be helping you is a soldier.
A soldier of fortune.
He'll find out when the gold leaves Guadalupe and what road you must follow.
He's made the arrangements with the men that sell guns.
He's waiting for you in Kingsville, Texas.
- And don't forget the password. Hear?
- I know.
There's still another thing that I keep worrying about.
Mu st wo oave t h o revo u t o n up to a so d or o f fort u no??
This one, yes.
He's all right, Escudo. It's Sabata.
Ah. It's very good.
Tequila, a bottle.
It stinks in here.
Smells like pigs are around.
Here, you smell anything, Septiembre?
Your friend has no nose, or he's a liar.
All you mangy pigherders smell disgusting.
You're too full of it to be a judge, my friend.
Well?
Well?
Any time.
Uh-uh.
Isn't it enough you lost a friend?
Aw.
Have a beer!
The smell doesn't bother him any more.
From now on, he's going to learn to smoke.
Thank you, hombre. Many thanks.
If friends are what you need?
Anything for Benito Juarez.
This is our man. This one's Sabata.
Amigo, Ocano sent us to meet you.
N co toc h nkqu o, h u h??
Tco m os w t h b ract co
The last time I played this...
Ah, here it is.
Los Palos, St Christopher's Day.
I've got a bad memory.
Write everything down in the book.
Nover w t h o u t t
Wa t fo r m o o u ts do
Colonel Skimmel appreciates an artistic type like myself.
Relaxes with me.
In Guadalupe, I'm like one of the family.
Out at the fort every day.
Seeing things, hearing things.
Do you know Colonel Skimmel?
He challenged me to a shooting match once.
- Hard man to beat.
- It remains to be seen.
With four hands, it would be perfect, huh?
I play solo.
Such a pity.
Colonel Skimmel has two pianos.
Why not join me?
I'll play the melody.
Hey, amigo. Is your pal in there at the piano with us?
He'll keep out of this thing if I can help it.
- What about them? Are you sure they're OK?
- Sure. Who do you think they are?
Hoso two?? Ro octs fro m t h o oca m u so u m j
Huh, them? They're very good men.
They're my two falcons, two hawks, two eagles.
Two fighting buzzards.
Don't you believe me?
Hey!
See that?
What did I tell you?
And this one is Septiembre.
You want to see something great? Look.
Go ahead.
- Hey, you loco?
- You have nothing to worry about.
If we get the gold.
Lieutenant Stejer!
Easy now. There we are.
Here we go. There she is.
Detail... forward!
Go!
Colonel Skimmel, I'll never finish your portrait.
This is your twentieth sitting.
Ah, I see you write everything down.
That's a good idea.
M a ny g reat art sts h ave bad m o m ories
- Time is money.
- That's what you Americans think.
But I'm an Austrian.
And for an Austrian, time does not exist.
Oh, no. I don't frown like this.
My face is more joyful.
- Loosen the mouth a trifle.
- You smile so pretty, Colonel.
Packing off a wagonload of grain made you as happy as sending a shipment of silver dust.
You don't miss very much, friend Ballantine.
As I've told you, Colonel, my mind never rests.
The peons are shouting for vengeance.
M ox co 's a h otbod o f revo u t on.
We shall crush them.
I've already taken the necessary precautions.
We Austrians know exactly what we are doing.
It's all been worked out.
It has been planned, pre-arranged and studied down to its last detail.
It is inevitable and mathematically perfect.
We Austrians are men of steel.
- Colonel, please.
- We never go back on our word.
Our beloved Emperor Maximilian is our model and our strength.
There. Much better.
Now
Whoa!
Somebody's moved in on our game.
Take cover! Quickly! We're surrounded!
- Long live liberty!
- Long live free Mexico!
What's going on?
Let's get out of here. Come on!
Adiós amigos
José!
Jesus! Juan! My brothers, my friends!
Amigos, may you be received by the Lord above!
M ay yo u r m ot h or wve o n h o rsso d u ng!
Two falcons without wings.
I was the greatest high-jumper long ago.
- Shame on you for such lies.
- Let's go get the gold.
Austrian.
Let's go.
Hy-hoo!
Hah!
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Wait for me! Give me a hand, Gitano!
Good. We made it, Sabata, eh?
A chest full of gold... to buy arms with.
Buy arms! Buy them to kill Maximilian and drive the Austrians home.
- Long live Mexico!
- Long live the revolution!
Hey, Escudo.
Doos h o ook ko t h at boca u so ho 'd ko a t h o go d to h m so f?
No, not h m Natu ra y g oo m y o was bo rn w t h a faco t h at ong t's t h o t rut h
When he was born, there was a great rainstorm. Your birthday's the 2 September?
You're wrong, amigo. It must be the 2 of November, All Souls' Day.
Well done, Lieutenant.
Traitors should be shot in the back.
Escudo was in command of the Mexican rebels.
I also saw Sabata with him.
I know him. He's a great shot.
They were headed for Texas.
- Thank you, Lieutenant. You can go.
- Yes, sir.
Writing table.
- We're in very serious trouble.
- They won't get very far.
We have an efficient intelligence service in Texas.
Hm.
It'll be easier to hide individual sacks of gold than a clumsy chest like that.
Mu c h oas o r hs c h ost m u st n' t bo u nloadod
Not at t h s t m o h at's o u r ordorss
Rg h t W o ca n' t obon it
Whoa.
Whoa.
Wait for me at the San Juan Monastery.
I'm heading in to Kingsville.
The gunrunners will be waiting for me there.
- And so will Ballantine.
- Ballantine? I...
The piano player.
So long.
It's Sabata.
Gentlemen.
Your gun, please.
Gunrunning is a dangerous profession, isn't that right?
I faint at disagreeable sights.
That's why they wear hoods.
You're an intelligent man, Sabata.
I respect you.
- Why do you join up with scum?
- They are more my kind. You're not.
- Mind if I smoke?
- Mm.
Oh, I forgot. I took the last one myself.
- I can buy some more with your gold.
- I shan't even ask you where it is.
I shall use a little Austrian logic.
In fact, it's discovered already.
When you have gold, there aren't many places to hide it.
Like the San Juan monastery.
Sorry, I don't belong to that parish.
Even so, we will see you have a respectable funeral here, in Kingsville, as will all your Mexican friends.
I'll be back, I assure you.
You'd be smart to relax a little bit, while we wait for Mr Folgen to return.
No, t h a nks W o do n' t d rin k w t h t h o doad
I drink only with friends... except for you.
Don't mind my back, gentlemen.
Forget it, Sabata.
It's your home, after all.
Septiembre, come on in and have a shot.
That won't work with us. Try again.
- Your brother?
- Mm-mm.
The sun is high.
And where is he?
I don't like this place. It's too quiet.
Silent as death.
Only Escudo's footsteps can be heard on the dry earth.
Everybody else is dead.
Even you seem to be dead.
Ah, go to hell.
And the gold, right out there.
The way things are now, this is the perfect chance to take it.
- Whose chance?
- How would I know that?
It could even be my chance.
You believed it, didn't you?
Why not mine?
Manuel...
We're surrounded. I'll try to draw them off.
You take care of the cart.
These American guns aren't very good, are they?
Escudo!
- First we must think of the gold.
- To hell with the gold. Gitano!
Gitano!
Stop! Don't shoot!
G ta no, aam go, m ay yo u r so u bo reco ved by t h o ord above
Idiot!
You want me to have a heart attack?
- Come on, amigo. Hurry!
- Don't try anything. You're covered.
He tricked us. The Austrian bastards will kill us.
- Get your hands up.
- No, you first.
Amigo
Oh.
They have the gold, huh?
Hey, Blondito, where do you think you're going?
Sabata, I'm glad you showed up.
Tell him I wasn't stealing it.
I just thought one of us oughta take care of the gold.
Huh?
Gitano, the flamenco of death.
Why did you stop me?
It's only fair. After all, he's the one who gave us the information about the gold shipment.
Him?
He said he was trying to protect the gold.
No reason w h y s h o u d n' t bo ove h m
No??
No
The gunrunners have been wiped out.
- All we can do is turn the gold over to Ocano.
- We'll take care of that.
I think I'll come along.
I got the rest of my pay coming.
Me too. From him.
Don't worry. Now let's get moving.
Every Austrian in the territory will be looking for us now.
We'll make our first stop at Eagle Pass on the Mexican border.
You can thank Sabata we didn't kill you this time, Blondito.
If your crazy stunt had worked, they would have taken their revenge on me.
You saved my life.
Fyo u save a m a n' s fo, yo u 're resbo nss b o fo r h m for t h o rest o f h s days
It makes me feel quite secure.
About the gold.
You and me. Fifty-fifty?
Hey, what's he say?
- He wants us to try a new idea.
- His ideas are nothing.
Mot h m a nd k now ng h t away ho was no good
You know why?
Because he's got a big mouth.
All OK.
Admit it's a good idea to hide the gold here.
- Think he's trying to trick us?
- Just don't let him get out of your... rifle range.
Come on!
Ballantine, hi.
It's been so long.
I'm still your favourite model, aren't I?
We... never quite finished that picture, did we?
Sabata! Come on out with your filthy friends or we'll kill everyone in the place!
Hey, hold it!
All right, we're leaving.
Sabata.
- What are you doing here?
- I got information for you.
The Austrians are falling back. Our people just took Las Palomas and Trincheras.
- How do you know?
- I'm Mexican. I know.
How long have you been following me?
Go home.
Go back to Father Mike.
- If you say so, Sabata.
- All right, watch your step.
Be with you in two shakes, huh?
Escudo! Where is the cart?
For the last time, where is the cart?
Manuel, it has been in a good cause and also may your soul be received by the Lord.
You stand honoured by your deeds, up to the end.
Yes. And you shall be a model held in honour among our men.
José, Juan, Jesús.
They shall sing your praises in Mexico in all the days to come.
If I should forget, let me be thrown into the deepest pit of hell.
Hey, I almost forgot! Where's Ballantine?
Hyah!
We were just gonna go look for you fellas. Right?
Take it. Here.
It's yours.
With a load of gold like this, split three ways, three happy hombres living in peace and plenty.
Shall we go?
Hm.
- We stay.
- Ballantine!
Now wo m ay a oave
Whoa!
Hyah!
- But it's for the revolution.
- Oh, sure! The revolution.
All this beautiful gold turned into rifles, cannons and death.
- I'm not touching it.
- How about trying to buy peace with it?
A load of gold could be divided five ways.
What a contribution to my favourite charity: Me.
No! T's only go ng to t h o revo u t o n ho A u st ria nss a re ret reat ng h oy 've d u t
- How do you know that?
- There are ways.
- You're just talking. I don't believe you.
- OK, don't.
Yo u b a nn od t h s n Texas bu t wo n' t ot yo u rob u s o f a revo u t o n
Mothers, sisters, wives and sweethearts, all weeping and all blaming you.
M o?? W h y b a m o m o??
You want to change this harmless gold to death and destruction.
Remember your dead friends,
Juan, José, Jesús... Manuel?
No! H oso m o n a re doad bu t not t h at basta rd M ax m a n
M ox co m u st bo bo ratod!
Long live Mexican liberty!
Long live the revolution!
All right, you win.
- I think it does belong to the people.
- Comes the revolution!
- Ah!
- Yeah!
Ah... Hey, Senor Gold!
"Today, April 26th, I am finally rich!"
Gold! Gold!
Sand.
We risk our lives, let them kill our men.
For what? A box of sand?
God, we must be crazy.
Well...
Easy come... easy go.
Let's look at the Austrians' logic.
A load of gold is shipped from Guadalupe.
A band, not of Mexicans but Austrians dressed as Mexicans, attacks and steals the gold.
The blame falls on the revolution.
Bu t Co ono SSk m m o d d n' t f g u re on o u r r a d
Now h o knows t h at wo know
He may be an officer, bu t do n' t oxboct h m to bo a gont o m a n
One measly sack of the real stuff...
...on top.
Skimmel. That lousy thief. Pah!
Wo, gont o m on, t's boon f u n, bu t ca n' t wasto a ny m ore t m o
I want to wish you all the... very best of luck.
Especially you, Escudo. You're gonna have a hard time convincing the revolutionaries that you didn't steal the gold.
And you know what'll happen?
You might end up dripping fat into the fire with an apple up your big mouth and a spit up your caboose.
Save your bullets for the revolution.
Adiós
!A diós!
I know what's on your mind. I just tell Ocano the men who stole the gold were those two.
Both of you are cowards.
They trust me. I don't have to lie.
- Huh?
- Mm-mm.
Senor Ocano, the French at Candelas and Atienza are getting reinforcements from Colonel Skimmel's army.
We could attack the fort from the rear, from Texas, across the bridge at Guadalupe.
The revolution is not going to cause an international incident.
Gaviota will fall, then we're set.
As soon as those precious new weapons arrive, we'll strike at Candelas and at Atienza too.
As for Skimmel's Austrians, to cross the Sierras is impossible.
But they could slip out, north, into Texas across the only bridge the Austrians control, this one, at Guadalupe.
Perdito, it's a job for you.
Blow up the Guadalupe bridge.
Kngsville s t h at way
Bu t SSk m m o
I'd like to collect the money on his portrait.
How much are you asking for it?
A chest full of gold?
You kidding? I'd end up before a firing squad.
- I got a plan.
- Forget it.
No, m oa n it. W o go f fty f ryy
We'll split it in five equal shares.
But how?
Those three?
God knows where they are. Hey!
- Where are you going?
- Guadalupe Bridge.
Forward march!
Skimmel!
Skimmel, we must be quick.
Gaviota's about to fall to the revolutionaries.
Major Metternich! Open up!
Bofore nig h tfa, t h o ont re ga rr son w bo ma rc h ng towa rd Ca ndo as to a d t h o renc h
We shall go to Texas at daybreak in civilian dress, posing as honest beer merchants.
- The rebels are blocking the way.
- As soon as we cross the bridge, we blow it up.
Hello.
I've brought a present for Colonel Skimmel.
It's Sabata.
Just in case.
Hey!
We just put those in there to bed.
Don't go. We have plans for you too.
Perdito! Leave Sabata alone.
He works for us.
The bridge must be blown up.
It's Ocano's orders.
Well, I admire your loyalty, friend.
Bu t w t h t h o bndgo b ownk u b, how ca n wo got t h o go d to t h o g u nr u nn orss??
We've just arrived now.
We've new orders from Ocano.
Adiós. And good luck.
Now, m y B ond to
An apple in my mouth?
I'll show you who's on a spit!
Escudo!
You're always butting in.
This time I'm going to punch him in the jaw.
We need him. He knows where the gold is.
Blondito, huh?
Ha!
Four hours till daylight.
No time to waste.
Ca rr y a m oda fonk uck f yo u want, bu t not m y watc h
It's not because it's yours.
Septiembre likes music.
Soldier, Lieutenant Stejer wishes to see you.
He's expecting you in the orderly room.
Homeward bound at last.
- It's about time, sir.
- Of course it is. In fact, it's way past time.
M g u o! Do n' t wo over oat a ro u nd h ore??
This is a forgotten town.
The commandant doesn't care if we live or die.
You're right. They blame us for all their defeats.
You men, follow me!
There's no other way.
Septiembre.
Who's there?
All gone, eh?
Well, you picked some time to be without ammunition.
Hey! You clown.
Take the sentry's place. You too, Gitano.
Listen.
It's impossible to cross the camp square.
I'm gonna open the back door to the depot.
From there, there's a short cut to the gold vault.
Phew!
- Hi.
- Good evening, Mr Ballantine.
Let's move. The gold's right next to us.
Ah, you're crazy.
It's not where I would have left it if I'd stolen it.
That's safest.
I'd make a hiding place no one would find.
In the ground, a cemetery.
M aybo ove n in s do t h ore
- Can you read that?
- Beer.
Let's go.
Forgot your book.
Thanks for picking it up for me.
- We made it.
- Halt! Don't move!
Hm.
You're the last person I would have suspected, my... cultured friend.
Search them.
No, SSorgoant ot h m koob t
You may write your last wishes.
I'll see that they're respected.
I would not have given you the honour of being executed by a firing squad.
Squad halt. Left face.
Order arms!
Soldier, come here.
Write it down in your book, Blondito.
- I'll make a date with you in hell.
- It's too late.
Squad! Load arms!
Open it.
That's right. I left them.
Come on, idiot.
Ready... aim.
Major Metternich!
'D ko t h s d a ry to bo fo rwa rdod to my m ot h o r

Run for it!
Cover me, Septiembre!
One more blast from that cannon and we're all dead.
I thought so.
Crook.
It's not mine now. I won't need it any more.
The gold...
The gold... Tell the others.
The gold...
The gun.
All right.
What's the proposition?
What makes you think there is one?
If there was no proposition, you would have killed me by now.
Indeed.
- Order your men to leave.
- They've come too far, Colonel.
They want their gold.
Hmph! Only I know where the gold is.
And you won't get it.
Unless... you make a deal with me.
Sorry. No deal.
I remember our marksmanship contest in Louisville.
You're the only man who ever defeated me, Sabata.
Pity you won't have another chance to beat me.
- Nothing can beat a superior people.
- Who knows?
Sometimes an idea's enough.
Folgen confessed.
The gold is under the ship model.
- Huh?
- Just as you are, reach and pull.
Say, you got a great little brain.
Oh, Septiembre can use this!
Folgen. He wanted me to open this and get killed.
- Have you any other tricks for me?
- You're wrong.
This is a big mistake.
I did my job. My job.
- It's not my fault.
- Cowardly pig!
Don't kill me.
You can't do it.
You... You can't do it.
Now s u bboso yo u to m o w h ore t h o go d s
Well...
Hey, where's Ballantine?
How could you do it?
He robbed Blondito.
Ah, poor Ballantine.
To die in the moment of our triumph.
So artistic, so generous.
And the most honest of us all.
I weep for him.
May his good soul go to heaven and be greeted by our Lord above.
Wait. This means there's only four of us.
So we divide his share between us. Eh?
What's this?
M y God
Gold! It's gold!
Septiembre, where were you?
What are you looking for?
Saw the best of us, didn't he?
Come on, let's go.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Go!
!Adiós!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Hey, Blondito! Too bad you can't get away with it, huh?
Hey, no! You can't do this to me!
- I'm on your side!
- You phoney double-crosser!
Ballantine's share goes to my favourite charity.

NORTH-AMERICA
MINNESOTA TERRITORY 1850
Now I don't want to rock any more' not on land and not at sea.
We'll be home soon.
HOMESTEADER KARL OSKAR NILSSON'
NORTH-AMERI CA
What if it had been my oxen.
-Aren't we there yet?
-Just a little bit further.
You didn't consult me before you took a place this far away.
-Are the rocks hot?
-Yes' a little.
No' let's continue.
They might hurt us if they see us.
Anders claims the savages aren't that aggressive.
You couldn't come' Kristina' so I had to make the choice on my own.
-I have claimed the best land in North-America
-It's just so far away.
To a place like this' no road could be too long
Don't think I will just accept anything you do.
-Just trust me' Kristina.
-You never ask anyone's advice.
I ask your advice sometimes' don't I?
Maybe sometimes.
But you do whatever you want regardless.
At lest the soil is easy to till here
It's a nice place you've got here' Karl Oskar.
Do you see over there?
Can you see the 'shanty' up there.
It's only a little 'shanty'.
But it will have to house us until we can get the house ready at least.
We'll have to start as peasants'-
-even if we have more' and better' land than any of the big farmers at home.
Look at this' Kristina.
Have you seen anything like it? And it's just as deep throughout. We'll grow good bread here.
THE SETTLERS
-Karl Oskar?
-Yes.
We have to buy a cow' so we'll have milk for the winter.
I should have told you sooner.
We have nothing to buy a cow for.
Nothing? Are we that badly off?
Everything is so unconscionably expensive. And I haven't bought anything we didn't strictly need.
Surely a cow is just as necessary as anything else?
Not as necessary as the house.
But the whole winter. . . do you think the children will survive till spring without milk?
Is there no way' do you think?
How can we buy anything without money?
-Is that the winter coming already?
-It can't come that suddenly.
Will you get the house ready in time?
Next time I will build bigger.
And shave the timber on both sides.
Here we go!
One' two' three. . .now!
What on earth. . . !
Did you find a wild cow on the way?
You can borrow Lady over the winter.
We only need one cow.
The cow is old' of course.
But she is fat' and she has plenty of milk.
-Now she's stuck.
-Are you stuck?
It's your fault' Karl Oskar.
You've cut it too narrow for a grown woman.
You should know women have wider hips than men.
God made us to lie on our backs-
-whilst we carry out his commandment to populate the world.
Ulrika can certainly make porridge.
That's the kind of woman one should have.
-You already have a woman.
-The Indian woman couldn't cook for pigs.
She's only good in bed.
She's a bit small down there' but all the Indian girls are petite.
Yeah' I'll drink to that. Cheers!
The American liquor are good and strong' but they look like cows piss.
Come over here and give me a hand.
-Can you keep a secret' Arvid?
-My lips are sealed' you know that.
-I'm getting out of here as soon a possible.
-Are you leaving your brother?
Karl Oskar isn't in charge of me.
I'm going to look for gold.
-You never said anything about this.
-Such things must be kept secret.
But I wasn't planning on going on my own'
I was hoping you would come with me.
Will you?
-We don't have to cross any oceans' do we?
-No. Come on.
Hey there' troubadours' not bad. strumming both back and forth
Gusten's jaw is chewing the rhythm
Janne squeezing with might and sound
Your favourite harmonica sounds more like a horse in heat
Lena' you soar like the bird in the sky
And your legs are surely not made of led
If I have a girl in my bedroom' it sounds like a jackhammer
The skirts swings so beautifully to the sound of Jane’s notes and Gusten's song
And we see a day so beautifully blue the sun sets behind the mountains
Pink and purple the night sky hangs over Finnbäcksby
As soon as we get the road fixed up' if won't seem so far anymore.
Does anyone regret emigrating?
Does anyone regret emigrating?
Regret moving to a country where one is treated like a decent human being?
No' they'd sooner have to make sausage meat of me.
At home they think Sweden is the whole world. That's why they're so conceited.
That devils nest!
If you went out and had your morning fart'-
-people would carry on until the whole county was willed with it's sound.
It was meant to be' us moving here.
We should neither regret' nor be afraid.
I regret I didn't move here six years ago.
No one is going to make me leave this place' as surely as I am sitting here before you.
-Kristina?
-What is it' Kristina?
Forgive me' please.
Sit down and have a sip.
I can't help it.
It'll be over soon.
I tell you our next house. . .
Our next house at home here by Ki-Chi-Saga - that will be something !
Karl Oskar hates the Indians.
But they are smart enough not to go randomly digging up the soil.
Hey' Robert? That gold.
Where did you say that was?
-In California.
-No' I mean' do you know exactly where it is?
No' not precisely' will just have to go searching and ask for help.
Is it all scattered around' or is it all in one place?
It's scattered around.
-I wonder what Danjel is going to say.
-Aren't you your own man?
Of course' but he did pay my fare.
Afterwards you can pay him so much he could spend the rest of his life travelling.
Out! Get out!
Karl Oskar! Karl Oskar!
Oh my God' that was dreadful.
Au !
-Are you sure it's not serious?
-I'm sure it will pass.
-But your in pain.
-It will pass.
The time has come.
-Are you sure?
-It couldn't be anything else.
-But isn't it too early?
- 1 4 days. But it's not like I decide!
-We have to get help.
-Go to Ulrika.
I asked her when we were moving.
Ulrika. . .
There you go' little Kristina.
Help me.
-Will mother die' dad?
-There is nothing to worry about' Johan.
There is nothing to worry about.
Mother will be right as rain soon.
I can see the head !
Hold her firmly' Karl Oskar!
Hold me!
It's a boy.
He looks like his dad between the legs.
Hand me the scissors' Karl Oskar.
He was made in Sweden.
And let's prey the lords watches over him'-
-so he won't have any permanent damage from that.
He will be a true American.
Here' Karl Oskar.
His a big boy.
Shall we say hello to your mother?
Let's have the birthing drink' Kristina.
I baptise you Nils Oskar Danjel-
-in the name of the father' the son. . .
. . .And the holy spirit. Amen.
Let us pray.
Karl Oskar! I've shot an Indian !
-What are you talking about? You're lying.
-No!
I think he fell. He shot at me first.
If you've shot an Indian you've brought misfortune down on all of us. Where was it?
-Below the big cliff.
-Come show me.
There!
-Was he shooting arrows at you' or what?
-Yeah' he shot several arrows at me.
He's been dead for weeks.
He didn't shoot anything at you.
It's true' Karl Oskar.
I swear it!
It must have been another Indian in another tree. I could hear the arrows fly by.
You hearing is shot in one ear.
I know what this means.
For as long as the ground is frozen the Indians can't bury their dead.
-But I swear!
-You are lying. Take it back!
-I'm not taking any of it back.
-So you believe your own lies now?
In the end no one will believe you about anything.
You not in charge of me.
Your not my father.
I'm your older brother.
Well. . . that was the last of it.
From now on we make do without bread.
Couldn't we borrow a sack of flour from Danjel.
We still owe him for the bank' but I suppose we don't have another choice.
-Soon there will be one mouth less to feed.
-What?
I'm leaving.
I'm going to look for gold in California.
-And what exactly will you do there?
-Dig for gold' of course.
-Dig for gold !
-Arvid is coming too.
You can't. I won't allow it!
In America each man is his own master.
We worked it out this autumn
We'll work on the steam boat to St.Luis' from there on we take the highway.
You can't do it on your own.
You're only 18 years old.
You were only 14 when you moved away from home.
That was in Sweden.
That's different.
You made your own decision when you were 14.
Why can't I when I'm 18?
You can't stop me.
As soon as the ice melts we're off.
-Don't give me your last dollars.
-You might need them.
Just in case you don't find as much gold as you think you will.
LETTER TO:
Here's the flour' Mr Nelson.
I'm sorry that isn't enough.
I need 20 cent.
You don't have it? Well. . . I'm sorry.
Maple syrup. . . Everything OK?
Yes' everything is fine.
-Any letters for me?
-Sorry. We haven't received any letters.
-Has Samuel Nöjd asked you to marry him?
-Yes' it is true. Nöjd asked me to marry him.
Him too. And what did you tell him.
I told him the same thing I told
Mr Månsson and Mr Abbott.
I wonder who will end up being your husband.
I don't wonder about anything myself' Kristina.
I'm moving from DanjeI to Stillwater.
A miracle has happened.
I'm going to become a Baptist' and my husband to be will baptise me.
What on earth?!
I'm getting married to Reverend Jackson in StiIIwater. It's a miracle!
Kristina' I can't explain it!
There is nothing more I can say.
Dear' sweet Ulrika. You surprise me.
It's not like you to be upset like this.
I'm not upset' I'm happy!
-You couldn't ask for a better husband.
-It's a miracle!
Turn around' close your eyes. Don't open them till I tell you. Close your eyes!
Now you can look.
No. . . !
-You have to try it on' Kristina.
-No' no!
You look prettier than the grandest noble lady.
Here you go' Mr Nelson. 15 cent.
-That's right. 15 cent.
-What do you mean. . .?
That will be 15 cent for the postage.
Me? 15?
-Don't you have any cash?
-No' I don't have any cash. Not today.
Can you come back?
I'm sorry.
-Another day?
-Monday? Come back on Monday.
I will need to keep hold of that' Mr Nelson.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Reach out your strong hand' and yank me back to Sweden !
I thought you were asleep' Karl Oskar.
Something woke me.
-How are you' Kristina?
-I'm fine.
Just go back to sleep.
-Why are you lying awake?
-It's nothing.
It's just silly and childish.
You're sad' aren't you?
You're sad' Kristina.
If your battling with something' then let me help. That what good friends are there for.
If you want God to reach out and yank you back,-
-then I will reach out my arm and keep you here with me.
Do you know what' Karl Oskar?
There is nothing more to say.
It was a childish thought that occurred to me as I was saying my evening prayer.
Karl Oskar. . .
Don't you ever miss the old ones?
Maybe sometimes.
I can't help it!
Sweetness' ah my sweet. . .
Wait. I'm going to fetch you something.
Anna's old boot.
It helps me remember when I get homesick sometimes
Maybe it will help you too.
One day our children will thank us for moving to America.
-Do you think so? Do you really think so?
-I can feel it in my bones. I know so.
Maybe your right. One never knows.
Hey' Kristina?
Do you remember when we moved here?
And you said it was almost as pretty as it was at home at Duvemala.
I have been wondering if we should name our new home Duvemåla as well
What do you think?
Or maybe New Duvemåla.
Do you think. . .
Duvemåla?
Then we wouldn't live by Ki-Chi-Saga anymore.
We would live in DuvemåIa.
-It sounds so strange' Karl Oskar.
-Let's do it then?
Do you know what day it is tomorrow?
It's a big anniversary.
It's the 14 of April.
A year tot he day of-
-the day we stepped on board the ship in Karlshamn.
And tomorrow I will till
American soil for the first time.
Your Swedish' I suppose?
-Petrus Olausson' from Alfta County.
-Karl Oskar Nilsson' from Ljuder County.
I was thinking pf settling down here by the lake. Now we'll be neighbours.
In Sweden I had to pay a 200 'daler' fine for having read the Bible in my own house.
Sweden is corrupted by unjust authorities.
I every evening I thank god in my prayers for my new homeland.
I'm glad to get some neighbours. I didn't think anyone wanted to live this far out.
You won't have the place to yourselves much longer. There are two other families coming.
-There you go' Kristina.
-Then we can set up our own parish.
-A church parish?
-Yes' we'll build a church.
A small temple to God.
A gods house of plain timber' naturally.
First I have my barn to think about.
After that I was going to build a new farm house.
But you can't just toil in the here and now' and forget all about the ever after.
A barn is no excuse to delay building a house of God.
If only I had an oxen'
I would have had 30 acres by now'
I have an oxen.
If you get one then we can help each other.
-Are you the only man?
-My brother went to California.
Nobody knows if he is even alive.
This is where I'm building my new farm house.
You're aiming big.
The kitchen will be over here and the bedroom over there.
And the wall will go here.
Mark my words' Nelson.
You can't build it that big.
Look at this' Olausson. This is from Sweden.
This is from home.
-It's an apple tree.
-We'll have glass apples
I want to plant a blomst.
-''''Blomst''''?
-Yes' bI omst.
''''BI omst''''?
Ah !
I wanta bI omst.
-Seeds?
-No.
-Seeds. . .
-I know what you mean. I'll go get it.
This is what you want' Mrs Nelson.
You want five of those? Help yourself.
-Blomst.
-Flowers' Mrs Nelson.
Flowers.
-Flowers.
-Blomst.
How nice they are.
-The men here are very polite.
-Yes' people appreciate their women around here.
In Sweden' men use women as maids in the daytime and mattresses at night'-
-and in between she is nothing.
We just stood still for a while in front of this machine'-
-and as by magic we were captured on this thick paper.
It is just as nice as a painting.
Henry and have been standing there looking just the same all year.
Would you like some more?
-You have a nice and kind husband.
-Henry is very gentle.
How did you understand each other before you learnt to speak English?
We pointed and made signs and waved our hands a lot.
-Excuse me.
-Did you choke on something?
No' it's the priest coming.
Not Henry' but the priest I will bring into this world. That's why I threw up.
-I'm pregnant' you see.
-Ulrika !
When I got married I hadn't been with a man for four years'-
-so it felt nice to use the body for the purpose it was made for.
And that in a union blessed by God.
But Jackson was doing it too fast in the beginning. That was the problem.
Sleep tight' Kristina.
You've got a long journey tomorrow. Good night.
-Ask who it is before you open.
-Who is it?
May I come in' good people?
-Is he Swedish?
-Yes. Thank goodness
-He must have been out in bad weather.
-Yes' it was terrible weather.
-Where have you come from?
-St. Paul. I walked here.
I'm completely exhausted.
Sit him down' let him dry off.
It's so nice to come into a nice dry house a little while.
-He's bleeding ! Has he been hit?
-It's the mosquitoes' they were biting bad.
We are the Nilsson's.
Karl Oskar Nilsson' from Ljuder County.
Erland Törner is my name' from Väderstad County in Östergötland.
I see' ÖstergötIand. Well' well. . .
Has he come here to claim land then?
No' I'm a priest in the Swedish church.
-He's a priest?
-Yes.
I come to you unknown my fellow countrymen.
I have an emigration license which confirms that I'm. . .
We never doubted the father' not for a second.
Would the father like some dry clothes?
I'm sure Karl Oskar has some that will. . .
It almost feels like blasphemy to dress a priest in this manner.
Well' it's a little big' but nice and warm.
If the father will accept' this is all we have.
May I ask. . .
Why has the father come to America?
-For the sake of the emigrants.
-For our sake? But who pays him?
No one' but good people house me and feed me'-
-just like you have this evening.
Just the way you have taken care of'-
-I will be taking care of the souls of my fellow country men.
Would the father perhaps honour us with some bits out holy scriptures?
We have not been able to make our confessions for more than three years.
Oi ! Oi' oi' oi !
And from that can draw that sin is no joking matter
I have selected today's text from the Deeds of the Apostles chapter 1 7.
''''And he let people of all kind' who all come from one person' populate the whole world'''''-
-''''and he gave them set times''''-
-''''and lay out boarders to their territories.''''
Excuse me' father.
God has determined how far and how wide people should travel and flee.
I am speaking to you'
Swedish men and women-
-who have crossed a third of the earths surface'-
-who have travelled from one continent to another.
Me' poor sinful human. . .
. . .who has been born with sin. . .
. . .and who must suffer all the days of my life. . .
Jesus Christ' whose body you are about to receive'-
-may he keep you in eternity. Amen.
Jesus Christ' whose body you are about to receive'-
-may he keep you in eternity. Amen.
Jesus Christ' whose body you are about to receive'-
-may he keep you in eternity. Amen.
Jesus Christ' whose blood you are about to receive'-
-may he keep you in eternity. Amen.
Look now' look now.
We all know how Jesus. . .
You mean Ulrika.
She is my best friend.
But your friend is married to the
Baptist preacher in StiIIwater!
-She has been re-baptised !
-I know' but that is her business.
Well' you should know: we are not allowed to associate with heretics.
Don't let the woman into your house.
Don't open the door to her.
Mrs Jackson is an enemy of our faith.
It is only out of love we seek to warn you.
Brother Petrus. Does he know. . .
Does he know that he is speaking of my best friend in America?
-Friendship blinds you.
-Spirits appear to be friends.
You cannot recognise the enemy of the church in this Mrs Jackson because of it.
-Are you talking about Ulrika behind her back?!
-Poor child' what is she saying !
Be quiet. Put your wife in her place.
Help us talk some sense into her.
This is absurd.
You have nothing to do with Kristina.
She opens the door to whomever she chooses.
Don't you give orders in my house!
I don't need a guardian' nor does my wife.
At least that is cleared up!
Nelson' dear neighbour.
You must understand us. . .
You come over here wanting to separate Ulrika and me.
You speak ill of her and accuse her of evil doings.
You have forgotten the eight commandment' that is how much of a Christian you are. Shame on you !
-Come' Petrus. We have come too late.
-Dear Kristina. . .
We came her today out of Christian love' and you greet us with insults'-
-but I forgive you.
Heresy speaks through you.
Christian people must avoid this house' until we can clean it.
Out! Get out of here!
Out' if it's too dirty for you.
''''Clean''''' you said. ''''until it is cleaned'''' I will never forget this.
In this territory' 19 out of 20 men-
-lie alone at night whimpering till moss grows on their rods.
Or you have to do as Samuel Nöjd did and take one of the brown ones as your wife.
I could never go to bed with an Indian woman.
I am sure you would if you got desperate enough.
I'm sure there is nothing wrong with their pussies' even if they are very small.
If you wrote a letter to the
Swedish Government'-
-maybe they could send over a shipload of good' decent Swedish women.
And then we could swear' in writing-
-that we would rob them all of their virginity the very day they arrived. and then we could. . .
Or maybe possibly the second night at the latest.
If anyone had their virginity intact by sunrise'-
-she would get a 1000 daler compensation.
If only I had my own oxen.
I could produce twice as much.
It is best if you get off.
Stomp properly!
No. No!
Move!
Move' you devil !
We'll soon be home' Johan.
Wrap up tight in your coat.
There you go.
Johan? Little Johan?
Johan !
There you go' Johan. Just so.
I'll be back soon.
Robert! Are you back!
You recognised me faster than Karl Oskar.
But he was still in the crib when I left.
And here is one more. This is Ulrika.
-You must be hungry?
-I'm mostly thirsty.
I picked up a cold on the steam boat.
-Where is Arvid? Isn't he with you?
-No' Arvid isn't with me.
-Where is he now' then?
-He stayed behind over there.
You've got to eat. You've got to finish it.
You're nothing but skin and bones.
Is your ear still painful?
Yes' it howls and aches in there.
If only you could hear the things it tells me in the nights.
I should have had that crib with me tot he gold fields.
Gold is treated like an infant.
You rock it back and forth till all the sand and gravel is sifted out'-
-and the it lies there' flashing on the bottom.
Where did you find the gold?
It was everywhere.
Sometimes in the strangest places.
Once in a washer boy.
One night he got a terrible stomach cramp' screaming and twitching.
The next morning he was dead.
Then someone took out a knife and opened him up'-
-and inside it shimmered of gold
He had been stealing nuggets.
Swallowing a pinch here and there.
He had thought it would come out the usual way' but it hadn't.
He had swallowed gold for 4000 dollar.
-So that is how you find gold in California.
-That is terrible!
What dreadful things you have lived through' Robert.
Did you hear that' Karl Oskar?
Robert' did you really find gold in California?
-I'm satisfied.
-Is it true? I mean. . .
I have had my last landlord.
I have enough for the three of us.
Stop lying to us.
I can't stand to listen to this.
It's painful.
-You don't believe me' Karl Oskar?
-You know you don't have any gold.
No ones blames you for coming back without it. we are only happy you're alive.
You think I'm lying.
Take that. It's as good as gold.
I took out some pocket money from the bank.
Keep the trousers. They're a gift.
-Do we dare keep the money in the house?
-Who thins we have that kind of cash?
We got 1500 'riksdaler' for Korpamoen.
This is ten times as much.
I had a feeling Robert wasn't lying this time.
-We can't be sure though.
-Do you still doubt him?
-The money could be fake.
-Do you think your brother is a forger?
It will be Ok when we get to California.
Arvid. Everything will be Ok when we get to California.
Robert! Let's go home!
Robert' Let's go home!
Robert's sleeping.
Go out and play. Run along !
-We have our own parish' and a school.
-You brother is trusted here on America.
-Danjel and he are on the board.
-I have become a church deacon.
-So' you've become a church deacon?
-Without a church. But we are working on that.
We argued for a year about where to build it.
People here can't agree on anything.
They argue over the slightest details.
People have too little say in Sweden.
So' now they are making up for it here in America.
Are the kids learning English in school?
-DO you want to read a little for you uncle?
-Stand up' like you do in school.
''''A tall boy.
A beautiful book. Red apples.''''
''''I dress myself. She dresses herself.
We walk and talk together.''''
I don't understand half of it.
Märta' sing for your uncle Robert.
-Sing the school song.
-yes' sing that one.
To school we go and stand in row with clean hands and shiny faces
Ah' let us hear' with an attentive ear
Everything that is thought before it's too late
If we stand without posture and walk around thoughtlessly
Things will turn out badly and it will be our fault.
Ah' hurry and learn and yearn for knowledge
For it is much better than silver and gold
GOLDFEVER TOOK HIS LIFE
Arvid ! One of your donkeys has got loose.
We need to find it before he wakes up.
Don't exhaust yourself making your own clothes.
From now on you can afford to buy your dresses.
I'm not buying silk and velvet to begin with.
There are a thousand things I need more than that
-You are a good person' Robert.
-You've always been kind to me.
You've had a tough time over there.
It's a good thing you came out of it alive.
Alive. . .
You think I got out of it. . .
POISONUS WATER
Why daren't you tell us that Arvid is dead?
What?
That first night you told us Arvid had stayed behind in the gold fields.
You didn't say he had lost his life.
Who doesn't loose their life over there' do you think?
Everyone on the gold trail looses their life' one way or another.
Why do you always speak in riddles?!
Why can't you just tell us the truth for once.
Your burning up! I think you have a fever.
At least we are brothers.
Why won't you tell me?
That first night when I got home you said : ''''Stop lying.''''
I had started to tell you' but you didn't believe me.
You said : ''''I know you've come home without a nickel to your name.''''
Sit down' Robert. Sit.
Can't we be close again?
Why did you hide the watch?
Nobody thinks you have killed
Arvid and stolen his belongings.
Maybe your guess is correct.
Maybe it was me that killed Arvid !
Now your fantasising again.
One day he wanted to turn back' but I. . .
I can't take it any more. Leave me alone!
I can't stand it. . . forgive me!
DANGER!
GOLDFEVER
Robert!
Have you never been to a doctor?
-I'm 22 years old. I'm healthy.
-It could be something dangerous.
-It could be something fatal.
-Fatal. . .?
Kristina' you don't think I'm afraid of dying do you?
Isn't everyone afraid of dying' Robert?
Not me. Death can't do anything to me.
Don't say such things!
Nothing that happens can touch me any more.
Neither good nor bad.
-And do you know why?
-No. Tell me' Robert.
Because I have accepted my destiny
That is all.
Do you understand what I am saying' Kristina?
I am not arrogant.
I would rather humble myself.
Accept what there is.
Here you have you pocket money back!
Use them next time you go to the loo!
Pick the shit up! I can manage without your useless money.
Are you insane? Throwing away all that money.
''''Nothing worth''''' that's what the bank said.
They're not worth a shilling.
No' that can't be true.
Are you saying. . .?
Are you denying it' you devils liar?!
Your so full of lies they come up to above your ears.
You have spread you lies' but it ends here.
Why can't you speak to each other like normal people.
I always thought the money was good.
It's called ''''wildcat money''''.
I told you that first night. . . there we have it!
You knew. You admit it.
He knew it was ''''wildcat money''''' just like they told me in the bank.
He did it on purpose.
Threw his filthy money at us. !
I had no intention of tricking anyone
Listen to me. . .
Shut your mouth ! And you're meant to be my brother you god damn devils trickster.
To think one would have to go through ones who life being ashamed of ones own brother.
-I would never think. . .
-I'll shut your lying mouth for you !
-Have you gone insane?!
-I was just going to shut his lying mouth.
Are you badly hurt?
No' I don't think so.
It's nothing
It's nothing. It's not even bleeding.
'Lier-mouth' doesn't bleed.
Now we are going to have a talk.
Tell me the truth' Robert.
Dear' sweet Kristina !
I had no intention of tricking anyone.
I didn't want to trick anyone.
I'm not lying. I didn't know.
Since I never touched the money.
For I was saving them for you and Kristina.
I'm sorry' Robert. I was out of it earlier' can you forgive me?
I forgive you' Karl Oskar.
It is forgiven. Remember that.
You are my only brother' Karl Oskar.
But I would like to ask you to. . .
But it's too late now.
Too late for everything.
HERE RESTS ROBERT NILSSON
BORN IN LJUDER IN SWEDEN 1833
DIED IN MINNESOTA NORTH AMERI CA
1855' MAY I REST IN PEACE
''''and to withdraw. . .''''
''''. . .for ever' all allegiance. . .'''' we better find out what that means.
-''''and fide. . .'''' what does that mean?
-''''Fidelity''''.
-Fidelity.
-Are you sure about that' Johan?
-Aren't we going to be Swedish any more?
-In Sweden we have been struck off the register.
We are American citizens now.
Imagine if I were to use the name they have given me here ''''Chariest O. Nelson.''''
What do you think about that' Kristina?
I don't think so.
You may resign obedience to the Swedish King'-
-but if you change your name'
I will laugh at you' for that is vanity
Next time I get to vote for president
The American authorities have been gentle with us.
Maybe that is the right way to say it.
You always say things should be done
''''this way''''. It is ''''this way'''' !
Really? Oh well.
Yes' maybe your right.
Of course I'm right.
You just don't want to admit it.
You ''''closer'''' the door' ''''putter'''' in firewood and ''''putter'''' out the fire-
- when it really is to close the door' put more firewood in and put out the fire.
Okay' okay. I better keep my mouth shut the rest of the evening then.
Mother' listen to this: “Last year
25.000 of Elias Howell’s"-
-''''sewing machine with wheel were produced and sold''''-
-''''In America.''''
Doesn't mother want a sewing machine?
Dear Karl Oskar. Put in some more firewood and I'll make us some supper.
I can't put it off any longer.
I am signing up' or they will draft me.
-You don't have to yet.
-I might well do.
They can start drafting people on the 1st of October
Wait till then.
It is more honourable to go of ones own free will
Are you going to war of your own free will?
If I could get away for an honourable price'
I wouldn't go at all.
In that way I would be dumping my responsibilities on someone else.
Are you saying you are joining up so you can have a clear conscience?
Yes' exactly. Yes' that's it.
What does you conscience tell you about the fifth commandment?
Thou shalt not kill.
Yes' well' that doesn't apply to war.
-Where does it say that war is exempt.
-Doesn't a man have the right to defend himself?
That is what the other guy is saying as you kill him ''''I have a right to defend myself.''''
Kristina' are you against me doing this?
I don't want your hands to kill anyone.
I don't want you to have to live with the regret for eternity.
If you take the life of another' you loose your own.
I don't want you to be lost afterwards.
I am thinking of your eternal life.
So' that's what you mean.
It will not be sin if I kill my enemy in war.
Not for God' nor for humans.
It's the slave owners in the south who started this' we must be allowed to defend ourselves.
A Christian is not allowed to go out and kill people.
But I have to.
For my peace of mind' Kristina !
I don't want you to become a murderer.
But if you must go' then go.
For your peace of mind.
Take a deep breath. Breath out.
You'll make a good soldier.
Get dressed.
Sir? Come back here.
Bend your knees.
Walk around the table.
Run !
I'm sorry' but you have a bad leg.
I'm sorry' it's a shame.
If I were a man I would be proud not to be suited for killing.
Now you get to have me home for as long as the war lasts.
Yes. . .
There are those that eat their own kids-
-when they have nothing left to live off.
The soldiers in Red Wood-
-showed me a bunch of gnawed up skeletons of eaten Indian children.
But the stores were full of food.
The Indians food.
But the government didn't want to listen to their claim'-
-so they are not allowed to eat their own food.
How can they just accept that?
What are they meant to do? Starve to death?
Or kill others?
-What ''''others''''?
-Well' have a guess.
Those how have stolen their lands' of course.
-And who would that be?
-This entire country has been stolen from the Indians
The whole country?
I haven't stolen any land.
I've paid the government for every acre I've got.
Yes. . . but you bought stolen property.
Are you accusing me of dodgy dealings?
You acted honourable enough.
You acted in accordance with the law.
But that law was created after the fact' after they had stolen the land. and what did they pay them for the land?
One daler for 20 000 acres of the most fertile soil in the world.
When I got here' there was only wild grasses here.
Now there are crops that can sustain us and others.
I earned the soil when I ploughed and cultivated it.
Yes' but you had bought it cheap' Nelson.
Forgive me what I asked for this summer.
Because I didn't want any more children.
Now you have shown me you wanted things differently.
You must exist' God.
Do you hear me? You must exist!
Of course your waiting for us' Karl Oskar.
We stayed too long.
Bu there we so many before us' and when it was finally our turn'-
-a man who had had his nose saw of came in.
His face looked like mince meat.
A shame with such a nice man.
-I'm going to make dinner.
-So' what did the doctor say?
We have plenty of time to talk about this later. Kristina has had her examination.
-There is nothing really wrong.
-Well' does it hurt anywhere?
-You promised you would explain it to Karl Oskar.
-Yes' I did' my friend.
Come along' Karl Oskar' let's go into the kitchen and talk about it.
Kristina is broken inside
And now she can't take anymore.
Not a single time more.
The next pregnancy will mean death for Kristina.
Now you've heard it' so now you know.
Literally the doctor said :
''''Next childbed will be her death.''''
So now you've heard it in English too
Your wife will be fine and healthy' as long as you take good care of her.
Take care of Kristina' Karl Oskar.
And don't make her pregnant.
I'm sorry for you' having to sleep on your own from now on.
-I'm no good anymore
-You health is the only important thing.
But I can't stand by you any longer.
I'm used up.
You heard me. The only important thing.
I'm a useless woman. You no longer have a real wife' Karl Oskar.
I'm no good.
I've spoiled my health here.
Not everyone can take it
You have to stop drinking' Månsson.
You're ruining everything.
I have ruined my mother' is that what you mean' Nelson.
You're ruining yourself as well.
Stop drinking !
Have you ever even tried to stop drinking?
Every day for 10 years.
Then why can you stop?
Because. . .because I'm afraid. Afraid.
Afraid ! Afraid !
You can't. . . You can't. . .
Then what are you afraid of?
Mother!
-Are you up?
-Yes.
-Are you ill' Kristina?
-No.
Then what is wrong with you?
I am coming back to you' Karl Oskar.
What are you saying?
I want to be your wife again.
I have come back to you.
Do you want me?
You don't know what you are doing.
You're rushing into this
Don't worry. I know what I am doing.
We can't risk your life.
Only the almighty controls my life.
It's too dangerous.
How can you dare do this?
Easy. I don't care about the doctor.
I'm putting my faith in God.
If I live it is his will.
If I die it is his will.
Karl Oskar' I am pregnant again.
Now don't be afraid.
Things have always worked out before.
Why wouldn't they this time.
I have worked it out. In February.
It is due in February.
So it was in May.
That very first time' I see that.
That's not so strange' or what do you think?
Are the others Swedes?
-From Småland?
-From Småland.
Now they're running around in the potato field little boy. . .
I think we are getting visitors.
Really? Do we know them?
Yes' they have been here before and been given food. I will talk to them.
Satan !
-How close are they? Have you heard anything?
-No' nobody knows anything for sure.
At last nights meeting we agreed that we were going to resist' use force.
They could be here at any time.
We don't have enough soldiers.
I can't come. Kristina is bedridden.
She's had another accident.
I can understand you wanting to stay home.
You've never been one to shit your pants in fear.
But you need to get the children to safety.
I'll see to it they leave with the others.
One should be spared war when one has reached a certain age.
-We would be safest hiding on the island
-Don't' you trust God?
-He helps him who helps himself
-That is what I have always believed.
Lincoln has been to easy on them.
The heathens should have been driven off log ago.
The white man gives the red man the gospel' and the red man repays it with a war axe.
Perhaps they would rather have had bread than sermons.
Try swallowing that now.
Take this.
I though I would be allowed to keep it this time.
-I was so sure.
-Yes' but as long as you get well. . .
You shouldn't worry' Karl Oskar.
I'll be fine soon.
I know.
-They are ringing the church bells on a week day.
-It sounds like it.
-Why?
-I wonder.
-Maybe they are ringing for someone who has. . .
-Don't worry' Karl Oskar.
-You remember what I told you.
-Yes' I remember. I know.
Karl Oskar. . .
-Is it morning already?
-Yes' but it is still early.
It's so quiet.
Is nobody but you up?
-Are all the kids sleeping?
-Yes' I think so.
-I've been asleep for a long time .
-Yes' you've been sleeping for a good while.
I was dreaming that I was winging in the ox reins.
We were at home in the barn
Do you want anything?
Just some water
Thank you.
My love' you must keep still.
You must lie still !
I'm not sick.
I'm just very tired
You're still too weak.
You must lie still.
Karl Oskar. . .
-You're here' Karl Oskar.
-I must have woken you.
-Was I whimpering?
-No' not a pip.
-I'm better now.
-Is that really true?
You don't have to sit by me' anymore.
Tonight you can sleep' Karl Oskar.
Look here.
Your glass apples are ripe.
Have you seen such a thing?
You have to taste our first apple.
This is the first apple from your apple tree.
-Do you want to taste it?
-It feels so smooth.
-It is tender and ripe.
-It smells good.
Can you manage a bite?
Glass apples are so fresh.
-Where did you get that?
-From your apple tree outside.
It is the first apple we have harvested from the tree.
I see it now.
-It's a glass apple!
-It sure is.
It tastes like our apples.
Like our apples at home!
I recognise it.
Our glass apples are ripe.
But I am home!
Kristina ! Stop!
Dear sister Lydia Karlsson
The glass apple tree has fruit.
I haven't recovered from Kristina's death.
God took her from me.
How can you ask me to forgive God after this?
Hurry up kids!
It's time for food.

Train's late, Jesse.
It'll be along. Get your clothes on.
What about Grady and them?
They should have been here by now.
Ask me, I say they ain't coming.
Then who's that?
- Hey there, old Jesse.
- Hi, Grady.
Howdy, Grady.
Who's that up there?
Ben, how the hell are you?
Never better.
Me neither, soon as I get some of this dust off me.
Come on, give me a hand here, Sam.
Come on, get wet all over!
Keep in there, girl.
Okay, Sam, grab hold of her.
Hot damn, that feels good.
Calhoun and Sam Turner.
I've heard of them.
They're good boys, and young.
A lot younger than you, but good.
All right. What's it all about, Jess?
Beats me. All Lane said was meet him here at the train stop.
- It would be worth it.
- To him or us?
What difference does it make?
It's something to do, isn't it?
Jesse, I get so bored sitting around doing nothing lately.
- Get to you, too?
- All the time.
Sam? Take them over to the corral.
Turn them loose.
That train Lane's coming in on, when is it due, Jesse?
Yesterday.
Any women in this town?
- One.
- Good, we can fight over her.
It's a long time since I've seen that big old Lane.
He as bullheaded as ever?
He ain't changed.
Gentlemen, this is Mrs. Lowe.
- We're working for her.
- We are?
That's right.
Doing what?
Ben, would you help Mrs. Lowe get set up at the hotel?
Yes, sir.
Now, what was that again?
I said, "Doing what?"
I thought that's what you said.
What in the hell did you do that for?
I told you to get me two guns that would take orders.
Draw your horses and skedaddle.
- Ain't we got a right to know?
- No.
Jesse, how about the pack mules and supplies?
- Ready to go.
- Good. Dynamite?
- Ben brought two cases.
- That ought to do it.
- What are you fixing to do, start a war?
- Look, Lane.
You still here?
- Damn it, we rode two days.
- That's your problem.
You gonna tell us or not?
Grady, where did you find these two peckerwoods?
They're standing up to you.
That should prove something.
I don't need them standing up to me.
I need them standing alongside of me.
All we want to know is what we rode here for.
What a gun rides anywhere for: money.
The more there is of it, the more chances you take.
What about the woman?
What about her?
- She part of it?
- She's all of it.
What's that supposed to mean?
- None of your damn business.
- Lane!
We've got a right to know what we're getting into.
A grave, more than likely, if you come along with us.
Then why should we?
Beats the hell out of me.
Unless you think gold is worth taking a chance for.
- Gold?
- $500,000 worth.
Already dug?
Already dug.
The hell you say.
- Don't you think it's about time?
- All right.
A train robbery, five years ago.
Ten men rode away with $500,000 in gold.
The fellow that was running the show figured they ought to hide it... until things cooled off.
So he took the Fargo box and two of the men... and rode south into Mexico.
Came back alone.
Said the other two got killed accidentally.
His name was Lowe.
The woman, she his wife?
His widow.
He had the misfortune of getting shot.
But he told her where the gold was before he died.
- And she told you?
- No, she doesn't trust me.
All she'll say is that it's four days south of here.
If there was 10 of them jumped that train, three of them dead...
- that leaves seven of them still alive.
- And still kicking.
You figure they know Lowe died?
Six of them were pallbearers.
Then why didn't she tell them?
Get her husband's share and let it go at that?
That isn't what she's after.
When she gets the gold, she plans to turn it in.
Clear her husband's name.
Why the hell would she do that?
They got a kid, a boy.
She doesn't want him growing up... thinking his old man ran around robbing trains.
Kind of high-minded, ain't it?
Not the way she looks at it.
Then why didn't she go to the railroad and tell them where it is?
That's what she was about to do when I met her. I talked her out of it.
There's a reward: $50,000.
- Hell, that ain't no $500,000.
- No, and it ain't stolen, either.
- We'll leave first thing in the morning.
- Lane.
Talking that woman out of going to the railroad... you might have talked her into getting herself killed.
You let me worry about the woman.
Bullheaded.
He ain't changed.
Come in.
Mrs. Lowe?
Join me?
Don't mind if I do.
I've had a few.
Yes, ma'am.
I started thinking about what I was letting myself in for.
It's not too late to change your mind.
Let you and the others go alone?
Yes, ma'am.
- I told you before, Mr. Lane, that I...
- You don't trust me.
Can't say as I blame you.
You realize if anything should happen to me on the way...
- It won't.
- But if it should.
We'd be out of a job.
This the stuff you're planning to wear tomorrow?
- Yes.
- Put it on.
- Now?
- Now.
- But...
- Put it on.
You can turn around.
The pants aren't bad.
That shirt ought to be tighter.
- Take it off and I'll boil it.
- Boil it?
Shrink it up.
I want you to stick out in the right places... so that if anybody a long ways off sees you... there'll be no doubt you're a woman.
- Mr. Lane, if you're trying to shock me...
- I'm trying to keep you alive, Mrs. Lowe.
If they see you along, they'll know you haven't told us where the gold is hidden.
And they'll be overcareful to keep you alive.
At least until we get our hands on it.
- I see.
- No, you don't.
If you did, you wouldn't come along.
But there are only seven of them.
That we know of.
With this much money up for grabs... likely they've got every two-bit gunman in the territory along.
Maybe I should go to the railroad.
Maybe you should, at that.
Thanks for the drink.
I'll tell the boys.
Can't that wait until morning?
Why should it?
I might change my mind.
Again?
I'm a woman.
And I'm out two train tickets and five friends.
Let's let it go at that.
There's a train due through here tomorrow.
I'll put you on it.
Good night, Mrs. Lowe.
Mr. Lane.
Boil it.
Yeah. I'll boil it.
- Stay with him, Jesse.
- Come on, Jesse.
Grab him by the tail!
I think them boys will need a hand.
They'll need more than that if that stuff blows.
Show him who's boss, Jesse.
- Come on, now.
- Hang on to him, Sam!
Whoa, son of a buck.
Don't you think we ought to put this on a gentle one?
This is the gentle one.
Hold on to him!
Goshdarned mule!
- He's had it. He's all right.
- Okay, I got him.
Do you mean to tell me you're gonna trust that jackass?
They get kind of rank when they ain't had a pack on in a while.
- He'll be all right.
- Ain't worried about him. It's us.
He'll settle down.
Here, hold this.
How'd you like to draw into a pair like that?
Guess you don't get to town very often, Calhoun.
Go on, take a good look.
But from here on in... you'd better be looking over your shoulder if you want to stay alive.
All right, Jesse, get her on a horse and point her south.
Yes, sir.
- Give him a hand with the mules.
- We ain't no mule packers.
- You will be by the time you get back.
- If we get back.
Do you see that knot-head packing that dynamite?
Do what you're told, Cal.
- Yeah, but...
- Calhoun!
There will be one boss.
Now go help with the mules.
Just like old times, huh?
Like hell it is.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Let's go to Mexico.
You afraid of the dark, Jesse?
- Fire's going out.
- Let it.
- Something wrong, Lane?
- Thought I heard something.
I guess not.
Just my old heart pounding.
Gets to doing that when I'm around a good-looking woman.
- Want some more coffee, Mrs. Lowe?
- Thank you.
Coming up.
Lane tells us you got a little boy.
How old is he?
- Six.
- That's a good age.
What do you call him?
Matt. It was his father's name.
- Sorry, didn't mean to bring it up.
- It's all right.
No, it's not all right. I talk too much.
That's the trouble with always running around wild.
You get kind of starved for female attention.
You get near a woman, start talking, and next thing you know... you say something wrong and hurt somebody's feelings.
Shut up, Grady, before you put your other foot in your mouth.
See what I mean?
Hurt old Jesse's feelings.
Got him all mad at me for no cause.
I've been mad at you ever since I've known you.
Jesse, that's 10 years.
That's an awful long time to go around hating a man.
I never said I hated you.
Well, there ain't exactly any love between us.
I damn sure ain't sweet, if that's what you mean.
You know, sometimes...
I hate to break up this friendly chatter, but it's your first guard, Grady.
Jesse, you spell him at midnight.
Don't pay any attention to Grady, ma'am.
He's his own worst enemy.
The hell he is.
It might mean nothing... but I think I'll take a pass at our back track.
Ma'am, when you finish that coffee, you better bed down next to the coals.
Gets kind of chilly long towards morning.
- Jesse?
- Yes, ma'am?
How long have you known Lane?
A lot of years.
Me and Grady rode with him during the war.
Behind him, I should say.
He was our officer.
We fought together for a couple of years before he ever knew we had a name.
Then one day at Vicksburg, we were ordered up a hill.
Over a hundred of us.
Only three of us got to the top alive.
Lane, Grady and me.
We've been going up hills together ever since.
And the others?
Young Ben, he's been along with us ever since Lane shot him.
Shot him?
Backing out of a bank in Tucson.
Tried his hand at stealing.
Lane broke him from that.
Doctored him back to life, got the bank to drop the charge.
Calhoun and Sam, them I only just met.
But from what I've heard... they haven't made up their minds what side of the law they're on.
That's the trouble with young guns.
It's mighty tempting to cross over to the wild side.
I don't think they will, though.
Not now. Lane will see to that.
How is it he never took a wife?
He did.
Right after the war.
Me and Grady stood up for him.
I never got so drunk in my life.
A year later, she died.
We went up that hill with him, too.
What the hell was that for?
You were the last man on guard.
- That's right.
- Count the mules.
It must have pulled loose.
And packed itself and walked away.
- They led him off, then rode off with him.
- How many were there?
Four of them I could make out.
Let Sam and me go after them.
We can get that dynamite back.
One stick at a time.
Grady, when this is over...
- What?
- You brought him. Saddle up.
- I'm sorry, Grady.
- You're sorry?
- Go pick him up, Cal.
- Yes, sir.
How in the hell do you figure that mule got here?
Well, my Spanish is kind of rusty... but it seems those fellows that borrowed our mule... wanted the dynamite to blow their friends out of jail.
Do you suppose they'll let Cal have that knot-head back?
I think gladly.
Jesse, you better tell the boys to hobble the horses.
If we lose them in this storm... we'll have a hell of a time getting them back.
Right.
- Let me give you a hand, Jesse.
- Thanks.
I'm afraid I'm not sticking out in the right places.
I mean if somebody far off sees me.
Yeah, well, I don't think anybody will bother us tonight.
I probably shouldn't say this... but sometimes I get to thinking
I'm making a mistake.
I already told you that.
I mean about the gold.
What if I didn't turn it in?
What if I didn't go to the railroad?
You'd be a rich woman.
And that boy of yours... would have a mother that goes around robbing trains.
You're an honest man.
If you thought that... you'd be waiting for us back at that train station.
And what if you all didn't come back?
Well, then you'd know... that we got to figuring that maybe we'd made a mistake.
Gold has a way of bringing out the larceny in all of us, Mrs. Lowe.
That's why I'm along, Mr. Lane.
And that's why I'll stay along.
Grady!
- He's alive.
- He won't be if we don't get this off him.
- I'll get his head.
- Stay away from him, Cal.
If we pick this tree half off him, he'll kick himself to death.
- I know that, and you along with him.
- Yeah, but he's my horse.
I know.
- Grady.
- Calhoun!
You've been warned. Make up your mind!
All right, grab a hold. Heave!
Heave!
He's all right!
That's good.
Now maybe we can get some shuteye.
Soon as you hobble those horses.
Sam, walk him around.
Yes, sir.
I was wrong about you.
How's that?
For hitting you back there when the jackass got stolen. I'm sorry.
A man gets older, it's harder to say that.
He tries to bully his way through.
I had it coming.
- No, you didn't.
- I was on guard.
So was I, trying to catch you sleeping... so I could put you in your place once and for good.
While I was worrying about kicking your butt... they stole that ornery mule.
It was as much my fault as it was yours.
I just wanted you to know that.
What's wrong with him?
Not one damn thing.
- We can cross upriver.
- Good.
I didn't say that she didn't say... that the gold was half a mile from the river crossing.
What I said...
Slide off and let him swim!
I'm trying to!
What I said is, I don't know whether this is the right river crossing.
- This is the only one we could find.
- Then maybe...
You think she's drowning?
Sure does look like it.
- Is she all right?
- Come on, give us a hand.
Try to keep her feet higher than her head.
She'll be all right after she catches her breath.
- Get the whiskey.
- Whiskey?
What are you trying to do?
Save her life or get her drunk?
- I don't swim, you know.
- I do now.
Mrs. Lowe... if that shirt shrinks up any more, you're going to be in a little trouble.
But not from you, Mr. Lane.
- What's he up to?
- My last bottle.
I should fall in the river more often.
I haven't felt this good since I can't remember when.
Can you remember when, Mr. Lane?
I can remember when.
I'll have another.
I drink, you know.
But I can handle it.
"Handle your whiskey and never feel sorry for yourself."
My father said that.
Good words to live by.
He said it to my brother, but I never forgot it.
- A lot of things I never forgot.
- Yes, ma'am.
Do you always have to be so damn polite?
Makes it harder on me.
How's that?
You're trying to trick me, Mr. Lane.
Trying to get me to tell you something... without letting me know... that I told you what I know.
Yes, ma'am.
- Mr. Lane.
- Yes, ma'am?
I'm the kind of woman... that, once I made up my mind... there ain't no turning back.
And I made up my mind.
You know... once I tell you...
I'll probably never ever see you or any of the others again.
I'm gonna miss you, Mr. Lane.
You'll probably be glad to get rid of me, but I'm going to miss you... very much.
We'll swing west to the Bravo... follow it on up.
That way we can stay out of trouble...
Mr. Lane!
That was a rotten thing for you to do last night, getting me drunk!
Yes, ma'am, it was.
I suppose you found out what you wanted to know.
Yes. Cut those mules loose. There's plenty of feed. Somebody will pick them up.
Why don't we take them?
No mules, no gold.
No use getting shot for nothing.
- You're turning back!
- That's right.
- But you can't!
- The hell I can't!
When I start plying a woman with whiskey... it's time to throw the key in the water bucket and ride on.
- Even if I tell you where the gold is?
- Even then.
I'll go back to the train stop and wait for you.
Looks like it's a little late for that now.
Them pallbearers sure as hell grew.
Maybe we ought to jump them.
Thin them out a little.
We'd better get moving out of here!
Cal! You and Sam hang back.
Anybody starts crossing that river before we're out of sight...
- baptize them.
- Yes, sir.
They're still up on that hill!
Got off their horses and went to cook coffee.
If we're gonna head west, now's the time to do it.
- Unpack the mules.
- Hold it!
- I hate to cross you, Lane.
- Then don't.
I've got to. We just ran from a fight.
That's a bad habit for a man to get into that makes his way with a gun.
- There are 20 of them back there.
- I'd say they were a little shorthanded.
And so would you, if it wasn't for the woman being along.
Go on.
I tried to warn you and you wouldn't listen.
You said to let you worry about her.
Now you think
I'm worrying too much about her.
- If we swing west, you are.
- He's right.
Don't make no sense, riding off without that gold.
- It does to me.
- It won't to them back there.
They're gonna come killing, no matter what we do.
You're wrong and you won't admit it!
You're just bullying your way through.
Seems like I heard somebody say that before.
- Mrs. Lowe?
- Yes?
Where the hell is that gold?
- It's a hell of a way to run a railroad.
- What?
I said it's a hell of a way to run a railroad, without any tracks!
When this wind lays down, we'll find them.
If you ask me, I say we won't.
I say Lowe lied to the woman.
Why the hell would he do that?
Any man who's gonna steal gold from one train... and put it on another train is liable to do anything.
It struck me as a pretty good idea.
At least he knew it would be there when be got back.
- Maybe.
- You heard what the woman said.
I'm not talking about the train.
I'm talking about the $500,000.
You wouldn't catch me hiding that much gold in the boiler of a six-wheeler!
- What?
- The gold is in the firebox of the engine!
What if somebody decided to build up a head of steam and struck a match to it?
It's been laying upside down at the bottom of a grade... along with two flatcars, ever since timber trains ran in this country...
- and that's a hell of a long time ago.
- I'll believe that when I see it.
Wonder whatever happened to that old boy.
What old boy?
The one that came riding in back at the train stop... laughing and scratching, saying how good it was to have something to do.
Grady, you're a pain in the neck.
Hell, everybody knows that.
- Get the woman.
- What?
Walk out there, where they can get a good look at you. Go on.
It rubs me the wrong way, hiding behind a woman, if you ask me.
Nobody did.
- What if they throw down on us?
- They won't.
But you've thought it all out. Maybe they haven't. Maybe they haven't even...
- I thought you...
- So did I.
Let's get out of here.
I hope we're not depending on any luck to get us back to that train stop.
- I think we just ran out.
- Not quite.
I thought somebody said the gold was already dug.
Keep digging.
That'll get it.
- That's what it's all about.
- I'd say it's time to load the mules.
I wouldn't.
We're staying here for a while.
- Staying?
- That's right.
Them 20 get up on that rim with rifles... it could get a little hard to stay alive.
Yeah, but not as hard as getting caught out in the open.
We've got to make a run for it sooner or later.
Later, there may not be so many of them around.
String a picket line over those flatcars.
The rest of you give him a hand.
You unload that mule. Bury the dynamite.
Bury it?
You wouldn't want to get blown to hell for a stray bullet, would you?
No, sir.
If they see that Fargo box, they'll hit us, won't they?
Just as hard as they can, Mrs. Lowe.
If you ask me, I say they're not gonna jump us, not here.
Probably wait at the river and catch us crossing.
What I'm trying to figure out is why we're going back the way we came.
Apart from that village, there's not a whole lot... to hide behind between us and that rail stop.
Lane says this is the closest way out.
Besides, we know the ground.
Yeah, we could get buried in it, too.
- Hell, a man can't live forever.
- Not around Lane, he can't.
Come to think of it, it's the best way, anyway.
- What's that?
- You and me, we can't get old.
What the hell use are we going to be to anybody in a rocking chair?
- That's a long ways down the road.
- The hell it is.
You're not one damn day older than you were the first time I ever met you.
Not outside, I ain't, but it's inside that counts.
Time was I could get drunk for a week, maybe two.
Now I go on a bender for six or seven days... and I get the blind staggers so bad,
I gotta get me to my bed.
When a man can't hold his liquor, that's the first sign.
- What about your women?
- What about them?
Don't tell me you don't run them as much as you used to.
Now, I wouldn't want this to get around... but the last time I was over to Kate's in Tucson...
I spent the whole night... listening to a fellow play the piano.
- Could he play good?
- Worst I ever heard!
You just weren't in the mood.
I'm not getting any younger, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
Neither are you.
What the hell do you want me to do, just roll over and die?
All I'm saying is, don't get old.
You'll live to regret it.
- Not yet.
- They'll be along.
I hope I don't let you down.
You planning to rob another bank?
No, sir, I mean when those 20 jump us.
- You'll be all right.
- I don't know.
I was thinking a few minutes ago that
I ought to get on my horse and get out.
Get out and never look back.
- Why didn't you?
- I couldn't.
Why?
I don't know. Maybe I was afraid you'd come after me.
- That's not the reason.
- It's not?
I hate to have to tell you this, but whether you like it or not... you're a man and you're stuck with it.
You'll find yourself standing your ground, and fighting when you ought to run... speaking out when you ought to keep your mouth shut... doing things that will seem wrong to a lot of people... but you'll do them all the same.
You mean like talking up for me in Tucson?
- They were wrong.
- Not if I ain't all the things you think I am.
- Not if I turn and run.
- You won't.
You're going to spend the rest of your life getting up one more time... than you're knocked down, so you better start getting used to it.
If any trouble starts, under there.
Cooking coffee again.
Like hell! Get under there.
- Ten men.
- So far.
- Maybe they'll give it up.
- They should.
- They can't shoot worth a damn.
- But they won't.
No, they won't.
Then maybe we should.
Your mind is as changeable as the weather.
It's not a joke, Mr. Lane.
I tried to tell you that before we left the train station.
- You wouldn't listen to me.
- Now you won't.
Not to turning it over to the likes of them.
But they're not going to...
I set out to get you and that gold back to the railroad.
That's what I fully intend to do.
No matter what?
No matter what.
Lane, they'll more than likely try and run the horses off tonight.
- You and Sam make sure they don't.
- We may need some help.
You won't get it.
The rest of us will be gone.
- Gone?
- To run off their horses.
Ben, dig up the dynamite.
They're running.
Not as fast as their horses.
Ben, you better take care of that leg.
I'll see if the woman's all right.
- What the hell are you doing up there?
- They needed help.
Get down.
Give me that.
You going to knock me on my butt, Mr. Lane?
Maybe I should, at that.
Don't you think we better get the hell out of here?
The sooner the better.
- Ben, how's your leg?
- It's getting better.
It'll be all right as long as I don't have to wrangle that damn mule.
You don't have to worry about that.
As long as she's packing that gold, we're in love!
- How about you?
- Are there any more rivers to cross?
- Just a little creek.
- I'll make it.
If them pallbearers jump us here, they'll wish they hadn't.
You put old Jesse and me up in that church tower... with a couple of Winchesters, they'll never know what hit them.
- We're not staying.
- How the hell come?
Did you ever bury a baby?
No.
Neither have I, and I don't intend to.
Not over gold. Let's move.
Better put some more wood on there.
Not too much. We don't want them to think we're asking for it.
Can't say that I like this, Jesse.
We've done this once before, during the war.
Me and Lane got up on the high ground... left Grady sitting by a fire, just like this one.
Blankets spread all around, just like we were all sleeping.
We were trying to scald them Rebs into the open.
They were driving off a lot of our horses.
- Did it work?
- It's according to how you look at it.
Long about morning, me and Lane kind of fell asleep.
- When we woke up, Grady was gone.
- Gone?
Yeah, the Rebs sneaked in and took him prisoner.
Never even fired a shot. If they had, they wouldn't have got him.
I tried to talk Lane into letting them keep him.
I think he would have, but he figured it was our fault that he was took.
They kept him a week and it was the best seven days of the war.
It's hard as hell to get to like Grady.
- Hell, he likes you.
- He's got to.
Me and Lane are the only ones who will put up with him.
I've got to admit, though, he's saved our hide a lot of times.
Jesse, after this is all over with... do you suppose, maybe me and Sam could stay along a while?
I figured you two would just roar off and spend your share of the reward.
We can go together.
Find some women. Get drunk.
That beats the hell out of cold coffee.
- I figure we better get some shuteye.
- Shuteye?
Yeah, Lane will see that we're not disturbed.
- What if he falls asleep like he did before?
- He won't.
Losing Grady is one thing.
Gold is something else.
Good night.
I hope so.
We better give them a rest.
Ben, you stay aboard.
It don't seem right, those boys haven't showed up.
- Probably still on foot.
- I doubt that.
If those horses stop running, they'll start thinking of water... head for that river.
So many of them, they won't be hard to track.
Yeah, they double back to the river... pick up their saddles, that'll throw them about a day behind.
It shouldn't.
No mules to slow them down.
Then where the hell are they?
If I knew that, I could get some sleep tonight.
Thank you. Hot.
We'll be at the train stop tomorrow.
And then what?
There's a north-bound due through at midnight.
Any luck, then we can get you and the gold on it... before anybody else jumps us.
- You're not coming?
- I'll stay along with the boys.
After this, I'll probably have to buy them a drink or two.
What about the reward?
You can tell the railroad we'll drift by and pick it up.
That's all you do, isn't it? Drift.
You could say that.
- Doesn't seem like much of a life.
- It's not.
- Then why do you do it?
- It's what I'm good at.
- My husband was good at robbing trains.
- Your husband was a fool.
Because he got shot in the back in a whorehouse?
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.
For him or me?
The boy.
No matter how things turn out...
I want to thank you for all that you've done and... if you should change your mind about coming back with me...
- I won't.
- But if you should...
I've got a saddle that's older than you are, Mrs. Lowe.
Get under the porch.
The Gold!
Lane, come over here!
- Look.
- Get him out of there.
Mule!
Something new!
Nail him!
- Quit worrying about that damn mule!
- It's not! It's the woman!
Look at that. They can't last under there much longer.
- We're going to have to rush them.
- What good would that do?
Get the horse.
Come a-running!
- Are you hit?
- No. I'm all right.
Go on! Throw it!
Much obliged.
Go ahead, tell her.
Go on.
Ma'am, it's about the reward.
You see, we've been thinking... if you go turn that gold in to the railroad... there ain't going to be nothing left for you and the boy to live on.
We've decided we want you to have that $50,000.
I couldn't do that.
It's the only thing you can do.
We've already made up our minds.
- Ain't that right, Lane?
- That's right.
Thank you.
That was very touching, boys, giving up that reward money.
- Who are you?
- I work for Wells Fargo.
- Pinkerton man?
- That's right.
I've been tracking Matt Lowe for five years.
- He's dead.
- I know.
I was there the night he got shot in that, shall we say, house of ill repute?
So was the woman. She worked there.
Mrs. Lowe?
Her name is Lilly, with two L's.
Matt Lowe was never married.
Better luck next time!
Lilly?
With two L's.
One of them must stand for "liar."
Where are you going?
Where the hell do you suppose?
To rob a train!
- To rob a train?
- It's something to do.
English
Take it easy, we're comin'.
Shake it up, we gotta go.
What do you think I'm doin'? I'm pushin' his boot and he won't even help.
# Whiskey river... don't run dry...
- All right, here.
- Thanks.
Hey, how about a little coffee?
Here you go... Can you use a little of that?
Put his arm in that sleeve, Leroy.
Got a little somethin' to go with that?
- Got his wires?
- Go get my wires.
- You said to put his arm in the sleeve.
- Button his shirt.
Button his shirt, put his arm in the sleeve and get the wire.
- His hat. Where's his hat?
- I'm buttoning his shirt.
Ooh... It's pinchin' my hair.
Come on, let's go. Here we go, rollin'.
I'm all right. Let me go.
- Is he gonna make it?
- Sure. Don't he always?
No.
 Now, ladies and gentlemen, we got a special treat for you.
In keepin' with our half-time theme of champions of the worid,...
...you're gonna get to meet one of the all-time great cowboys,...
...five-times All-Around
Worid Champion Sonny Steele!
Mr... Mr Sonny Steele!
Well, there he comes, there he comes.
Give him a big hand, folks.
There he is. How about that?
That is Sonny Steele, here tonight courtesy of Ranch Breakfast,...
...a division of Ampco Industries.
Ride 'im there, cowboy, ride 'im.
Oh, Wendell.
- Wendell...
- Shut up.
Oh, shit.
# Momma, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
# Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
# Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
For all you hard-playin' little folks whose bodies are growin' every day...
...you remember that Ranch Breakfast... uh...
...is the cereal that builds champions.
It's explodin' with a kind of energy that's... that's got more stuff in it, uh...
...than toast, and bacon...
- Eggs.
- Eggs...
And toast, and bacon, and, uh...
...meat loaf, and olives...
...nuts...
It's just got more good stuff in it...
Just so much good stuff...
# Momma, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
# They'll never stay home, and they're always alone
# Even with someone they love
 Welcome to the grand opening of another Pinto Mart.
Special rides for the kiddies with five-time All-Around Worid Champion...
Hey, Sonny? Sonny? Sonny?!
Hey, it's Lucinda. Lucinda.
Lucinda Fairlee. You...
The JB Ranch trick cowgirl rider.
OK, up we go. Hello, how you doin'?
You don't remember me?
Last month, after the Watsonville Rodeo?
Mommy!
I know how you feel.
 Ladies and gentlemen, for Ampco Industries, Rising Star,...
...horse racing's most honoured stallion.
In industry, in energy,...
...in development, in research, entertainment,...
...in nutrition, recreation, and in science,...
...Ampco Industries, the rising star.
Well, I won my rent on that sucker many a time.
- Horse should be standin' stud.
- We all should.
That's the beauty you're ridin' in Vegas Friday.
He ain't gonna ride him.
Just sit on him up on the stage...
...and he's gonna have little rubber booties on his hooves.
Leroy, you wanna sign this?
It's for that Watkins kid.
He drawed ol' Little Venus over in Fairview. Let's send him some luck.
I don't think he's gonna need it.
- You stayed on worse than Little Venus.
- Ain't no worse than Little Venus.
The hell there ain't. Nameless was worse, and he did eight on Nameless.
Well, I ain't on Nameless any more.
And I got no intention of bein'.
That was a little compliment there.
Here's a ranch for sale in Baily. 450 acres.
You shoulda got that place at Spanish
Fork instead of that Malibu house.
Oh, Spanish... What's the matter with the Malibu house?
I don't remember your minding it so much.
You was in the water half the time...
...wearin' them flippers, lookin' dumb, actin' like a damn penguin.
What's the matter with you pickers?
You're not on the bacon-and-bean circuit.
You got room service, you're flyin' around first class, you got limousines...
...ladies in the lobby, the laundry has tissue paper in it...
You're livin' like a bunch of fat oil barons!
Livin'... better than we got a right to.
- Cowboys in the ocean makes no sense.
- Beats havin' a bull tap-dance on you.
- Leroy, get them pants pressed, will you?
- And it beats havin' your legs braided.
And it beats havin' a bull use your head for a floor mat. Don't it?
Ah...
# Momma...
# Don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
# Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
# Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
# Momma, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
# They'll never stay home, they're always alone
# Even with someone they love
We'd have been here sooner, but we ran into these, uh, javelinas...
- Can I have a coffee?
- Just a minute...
- There's no rush.
- There ain't?
Come on. I wanna show you something.
...tonight's half-time highlight, one of the all-time great cowboys,...
...five-time All-Around Worid Champion
Sonny Steele!
Sonny Steele appears tonight courtesy of Ranch Breakfast,...
...a division of Ampco Industries.
Well, what in the hell...?!
- That's not me.
- They don't know the difference.
What's your name?
How come you're so cute?
- What time's the press conference?
- Uh, got half an hour.
Here you are, Hallie.
Now, if there's anything you need, just say the word.
We got about half a dozen movie people here...
...Bud Broderick,
Joanna Camden just came in...
...Rising Star is here...
- What are you gonna do with the horse?
He'll appear on stage with Sonny Steele, the cowboy we use in Ranch Breakfast.
You think he's worth coverin'?
Well, there's better stuff.
I mean, the cowboy's a peach of a guy...
...but there's just a lot of "yup" and "shucks", and stuff like that.
He's no interview.
Better steer clear of him.
See you downstairs.
Bernie... So, they don't want us to talk to the cowboy.
- Where do you wanna start?
- Where do I wanna start?!
Excuse me, please.
- Where the hell is he?
- Probably drunk in Barstow somewhere.
Excuse me, could you tell me if Mr Sonny Steele has checked in yet?
No, he's not listed.
- It's an interesting watchband.
- Thank you. It's Indian.
- May I see it?
- Sure.
Oh, it's lovely.
Why does Ampco say absolutely no interviews with Sonny Steele?
- Who told you that?
- Oh, one of the people at Ampco.
That don't really mean anything, you know.
Sonny hasn't been himself lately.
They're a little down on him. But it's OK.
He's just a cowboy. Sometimes he loses the best part of himself.
What is the best part of himself?
- You'd have to know him a long time.
- How long have you known him?
# Cowboys ain't easy to love
# And they're harder to hold
# And they'd rather give you a song than diamonds and gold
# Lone Star belt buckles and old faded Levis
# And each night begins a new day
# And if you don't understand him
# And he don't die young
# He'll probably just ride away
- Where the hell you been?
- What's he doin' in a parking lot?
I don't know, but he got here on time.
Come on.
Press conference has started and Danny
Miles has waited all day to rehearse you.
- Well, here you are.
- Wendell, what do I have to do?
Well, there's been all kind of hell to pay, so just behave yourself.
Boy, you smell like a tequila factory.
Here, put these Tic Tacs in your mouth.
You'll never guess who I seen.
Rush, and Hawkman, and old Edgar...
Hey, watch it there, partner!
They all send their hellos.
Foggy Tate's wife Louise gave me this handkerchief.
- I told you he was in Barstow.
- Whew! God, they got pretty girls here!
Come on. This is a serious thing to these people. They're tryin' to buy this big bank.
- Hold it. What's in here?
- It's a press conference.
So don't tell no jokes, don't lift up nobody's dress, OK?
- What do I have to say?
- Nothin', if we're lucky. Come on.
John, you had a question.
Do you anticipate opposition to the takeover of Omnibank?
Just a moment.
It isn't a takeover, it's a merger.
- But Omnibank has always opposed...
- We think that attitude's changing.
We've made a generous tender offer for the Omnibank shares.
We're confident they'll accept it.
Troy, you look like you're gonna jump outta that seat. You have a question?
For Mr Broderick.
Bud, you've played opposite just about every great motion-picture actress.
- Yes, I have.
- Who, in your opinion, is the best kisser?
That depends. What part of the body are you talking about?
Print that. I dare you.
Mr Steele, why were you 45 minutes late to the press conference?
Ha... Well...
I'd like to apologise for that.
I was, uh... I was givin' mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a bottle of tequila.
And we lost her, too.
Do you in fact eat Ranch Breakfast for breakfast?
Well, ma'am, I eat steak and eggs for breakfast.
- You were three-time...
- And Ranch Breakfast for lunch.
You were three-time
Worid Champion Cowboy...
Five.
Five-times Worid Champion Cowboy, and now you're selling cereal.
How do you feel about that?
- Lady, I don't wanna tangle with you.
- Listen, we've got a time problem here.
You are all invited by our chairman, Mr Hunt Sears...
...to a reception before the performance.
And enjoy yourselves, you hear?
- You got a rehearsal.
- What was that all about?
- I don't know. Come on.
- Rehearse what?
After you circle, you stop on your mark, stage left...
...lean forward in the saddle, face the audience, wave...
Where's the horse?
Bring in the damn horse.
Spot, please.
God, he's a beauty.
Tom, Sonny rides in circles three times, applause, applause, applause...
...then stops on the mark.
Sonny, your first line is...
- What have you got him on?
- A little bute. And some penicillin.
This tendon, it ought to be braced and bandaged.
- They think it don't look right.
- Uh, hello?
- What do you mean, they think...
- Sonny.
- After you stop, you say...
- Your horse is stoned.
How else are we gonna get him up here with all these lights?
Excuse me, gentlemen!
We're trying to rehearse!
Sonny, your first line...
"Ranch Breakfast... a champ's way to start the morning."
Then you look at the horse and you say
"Ain't that right, Risin' Star?"
"If you agree, don't say anything."
It's funny. It's funny. You try it.
"Ranch Breakfast, a champ's way to start the morning."
Wonderful. But much, much bigger.
Much bigger. Louder.
"Ranch Bre..."
- There's more. There's more.
- I saw it.
That's the most discourteous thing
I ever saw in the theatre.
Sonny, this is Hunt Sears.
He ain't no flunky.
This it here?
You ain't in no shape to see no Hunt Sears.
What I gotta do first? Jog?
Dual overhead camshafts, fully enclosed drive shaft, dual disc brakes in front...
Each item will appear in several major magazines during the month of July.
As an example of our confidence in the success of these new fashions...
...Ampco will be sending these lovely models on a one-month tour...
Sonny. I'd like you to say hello to Carol.
Hey. How are you?
Well, then let's...
Carol's interested in commercials...
Hey, Sonny, I wanna get my son a horse.
What kind is best?
- How old is your kid?
- He's six years old.
Get him a short horse.
- Hey, Hallie Martin. We met in New York.
- Did we like each other?
That question about the merger - who the hell was that guy?
That was Cross, the Washington bureau of the Times. He's connected to Treasury.
- He shouldn't have been here.
- Spilt milk.
Sonny, here's a couple I'd like you to meet. Mr and Mrs Phillips.
- Hi.
- Steve Phillips, the Million-Dollar Club.
Sold a million dollars' worth of Ranch Breakfast last year.
- Well, the mean-question lady.
- I'm just curious.
- Uh, Steve Phillips, the...
- You know what curiosity did to the cat.
He sold a million dollars' worth of Ranch Breakfast last year. Wholesale.
Are you kiddin' me? That's just fantastic.
- We're very proud of it.
- I'll bet you are. And I am too. Damn.
- I just love that...
- This is Grace Phillips.
I know. We met too.
Everything's going around and around.
- Oh, that poster is beautiful.
- It's a great gimmick. Very effective.
Grace, why don't you stand in front of it with Sonny, and Steve can take a picture.
Why not just take a picture of Grace in front of that picture of me and the box...
...with a picture of me on the box, holding a picture of me...
Then you got Grace and a whole bunch of pictures of me.
Sonny, you know that TV show in Denver?
We've had to make changes in your copy.
I bet it's shorter.
- In a multimedia situation...
- Mr Sears?
Hello, Sonny. It's about time we finally met, isn't it?
- Yes, sir, it's about time.
- Everybody here know Mr Steele?
Like our horse?
Couldn't have a better straight man.
- Can I have a word with you, sir?
- Perhaps later.
- Beautiful animal, isn't it?
- Yes, sir, he's an amazing animal.
But he don't belong in a parking lot in Las Vegas.
I don't suppose Las Vegas is the most natural place in the worid for any of us.
Well, sir, I don't think he's feelin' so good.
Let's give him a drink!
Rising Star represents a substantial investment.
You can be sure we've entrusted his care to experts.
Well, I don't think them experts are so expert.
Mr Steele, would you please sign this picture for me? For my daughter Tammy.
Look, why don't I make an appointment with Mr Sears's secretary...
Why would you put that horse on a stage with dancing girls?
- Just a minute...
- I'm talkin' to him.
It sells products, Sonny.
You mustn't apply logic to advertising.
It'll just confound you, believe me.
Well, it just don't feel right to me.
It seems wrong.
All them lights blinkin' and winkin', and girls...
Sir, I used to rodeo.
- And I was good at it.
- That's irrelevant.
To who?
This is a conversation we might have some other time.
Would it matter?
What matters is that you fulfil the requirements of your contract.
Which don't include your passing judgment on corporate policy.
Nothin' in that contract about me ridin' toy horses.
You're not in rodeo any more.
Actually, you're more famous now, aren't you?
Your face is on millions of boxes, on billboards all over the country...
...people want your autograph...
What I'm talking about is that you voluntarily accepted...
...a highly paid, relatively simple job...
...that more than a handful of cowboys would give their right arm for.
You're right.
I don't want just to be right.
- You want me to like it?
- It would be a factor in our relationship.
Mr Sears, Joanna Camden is waiting over by the earthmover.
- Why don't we have a picture session?
- Excuse us, please.
You bet.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- When this is over, get rid of him.
- Charlotta! Hey!
- Got a quarter?
No, don't... don't say it.
I bet that cheque's in the mail.
Wendell handles all that, babe, you know that. Come talk to me.
How is old Wendell who can't find a stamp?
Bartender? Give us a double Jack Daniels, please. Tall glass.
- The lady will take a Rob Roy.
- Orangeade. I quit.
What... What's the matter?
You're not born-again, are you?
Maybe I am.
I got me a record contract now.
All on my own too.
You be sure and tell Wendell Hixson that.
You sure are tough on Wendell. Not that
I blame you, cheques bein' late an' all.
I don't wanna talk about the cheques.
You know what I wanna talk about.
I want you to sign these papers.
You don't think I saw you tryin' to slip out? I left three messages.
Well, now wait a minute.
I didn't get no messages.
Sonny, that judge told you to sign the papers.
- Don't you wanna be divorced for real?
- Yes, I do. I just... Well, I've been busy.
Busy?! Doin' what? Makin' up excuses?
Excuses?
You got somebody now who sits up all night cos you lost your keys?
Or you got a flat tyre?
Comin' home at 6am, expectin' me to cook breakfast for a dozen cowboys.
And cowgirls who didn't bother to look like they hadn't been in your back seat!
Charlotta, yoo-hoo, you got a mean memory.
- Just a couple of parties...
- A couple?!
That light-up suit musta given you shock treatment!
I'm talkin' a lot of parties, and a lot of back seats!
But for back seats, we'd never have met.
And I'll bet you're still doin' it.
Stayin' up all night, burnin' yourself out.
You're just walkin' around to save funeral expenses.
You smile, babe. You get my insurance.
Do you know what your skeleton looks like in them x-ray pictures? A junkyard.
You couldn't get through a metal detector stark naked.
Give me the papers.
Huh?
Give me the papers.
- For real?
- Give me them.
You look like hell.
Well, you look great.
Hey. Would you come up to my room?
I can't. You just know what'd happen.
Yeah.
Besides, I got somebody who really likes me now.
Well, it's not hard to do.
- Who's the lucky fella?
- Billy-Roy Fix.
Billy-Roy Fix?
Is that right?
I guess there's just somethin' about us Western stars.
-  Mr Sonny Steele, please report...
- Oop, that's me. I'm late.
Goodbye, darlin'.
Bye, darlin'. Take care, huh?
Well, Mr Steele.
After this number, the motorcycle daredevils - God save us.
And then you and the horse.
Now, listen. You don't start those things until I give you the cue, yes?
Not now.
Not now! Not now!
Open the curtain.
Forget the routine! Go right to the finale!
That was very effective.
This is no criticism, you understand...
...but it's too dangerous to use that horse on a ramp.
He wasn't supposed to be on the ramp!
He wasn't even supposed to be out there yet! He's ruined the whole concept!
# I gotta run to keep from hidin'
# And I'm bound to keep on ridin'
# And I got one more silver dollar
# And I ain't gonna let 'em catch me
# No, I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
- What did he say?
- He was rude. He was very rude!
- And he wasn't concentrating.
- He must've said something to you.
Well, he was askin' about the horse's tendon, and the drugs.
Drugs? What drugs?
- Well, the tranquillisers and...
- That's done all the time.
They tranquillise the animal to keep it calm.
And the Butazolidin they use for the... tendon.
Mutual Indemnity and the police.
Which do you want?
- Neither. I wanna keep this quiet.
- You may as well know the rest.
Sonny knows horses. I think he's guessed we've used steroids to muscle him up.
Well, are they dangerous?
Well, they make the horse sterile.
Well, temporarily. I mean, it's just a side effect. It's not a permanent thing.
Do we put that on the box top,
"Temporary"?
- It goes away in, what, how many hours?
- Gentlemen, would you excuse us?
- There are drinks upstairs.
- Ah, the worid of illusion.
Just a minute, fellas. I'll be right out.
Jesus...
We're not talking about a horse, we're talking about a $300 million merger.
Omnibank will make a feast out of this.
If Steele talks to anyone before he's caught, we have no merger.
Ampco and the horse are the same thing.
If we've mismanaged the horse, we've mismanaged the corporation.
- Couldn't he have called the SPCA?
- What'll we say to the reporters?
- Tell 'em to go to bed.
- It's a little late for that.
And get those morons out of here.
- Come on, Bob.
- One drunken cowboy!
We have been advised by the attorney general...
...that the theft of Rising Star is grand larceny, a felony.
Should this prove to be a deliberate act, a warrant will be issued for Mr Steele.
At this time, however, our primary concern is the welfare of our horse.
What did he say to Sears?
They were really goin' at each other.
Hallie, give me a break, will ya?
- Ransom. What about ransom?
- The man's not that crazy.
He's been tossed on his head enough times. Thought about brain damage?
The cowboy is a little hot-tempered.
He's emotionally disturbed, that's all.
Come on, Fitz. He's made a mistake and he'll bring it back when he cools out?
- Oh, come on.
- Look, let me alone, will ya?
I don't know any answers.
I don't know from brain damage, from cooling out...
Look, why don't you go have a sauna?
Give me some good news, for chrissake!
"Cool... out."
...these days.
-  Why'd she quit him?
-  Who knows?
Sonny was married in Gus's living room.
And when that woman quit him,...
...well, you know where Sonny came to cool out.
Course, Gus is gettin' old and strange these da...
...well, you know where Sonny came to cool out.
Course, Gus is gettin' old and strange these days.
Seen Wendell?
No. I haven't seen nobody. They're just runnin' round like crazy people today.
- Buy you a drink?
- No, thanks. I got one. That's my limit.
Hey, tell me somethin'. Somethin' personal. Were you surprised he did it?
Who, Sonny?
Well, Sonny'll surprise ya. Just some surprises are bigger than others.
Like he gave me this ring one day, just like that.
Had old Wendell's teeth fixed for him, too.
- What's your last name?
- Smitley.
Say, you know something?
We got a mutual friend.
- Oh, we do? Well, who do we know?
- Gus Atwater.
I know Gus. Do you know Gus?
Where do you know Gus from?
Oh, sure. Wait, are we talkin' about the same Gus, from, uh, Tuba City?
No, not Tuba City. No, the Gus I mean is from Mesquite, about 30 miles up here.
Mesquite.
You wanna drive?
Morning.
Hello.
- You got any, uh, eucalyptus leaves?
- You must be a Capricorn.
- You got any eucalyptus leaves?
- Just tea bags.
- Well, I need some of them tea bags.
- How many would you like?
Oh, five or six dozen.
- Bags?
- Boxes.
Come on, boy. Come on, son.
Just a couple more times of doin' this and you'll be breathin' just fine.
If I live.
- Mr Atwater?
- # Golden hills
# Round her head
# Glimmer golden hills
Mr Atwater?
You wounded?
- No, I'm looking for a friend of ours.
- He ain't here.
- But he was.
- Yep.
From about this high.
- Was he here today?
- Here today, gone tomorrow.
Like a flutterin' bird.
- Hey, hey, who are you?
- I work for television.
- You know television?
- Yeah. I got one.
Works sometimes. Comes a-flashin'.
Woo-woo-woo-woo!
- Gus, I'm a friend of Leroy's.
- Leroy! Oh-ho!
Yeah. And, uh... and Wendell.
They told me you'd know where to find him.
How else would I know where you were? Huh?
We're real worried about him.
I gotta find him. I have to talk to him.
I can't hurt him.
He came here. Covered with a mist.
You know? Like floats atop a river?
And... and it grows into a cloud...
...and it shuts away the sun...
Where'd he go, Gus?
- No, please!
- What?! How did you find me?
- What are you doing?
- You're hurting me! Stop it!
- Who's with you?
- I'm alone.
- How did you find me?
- I swear to God...
- How did you get here?
- I drove myself.
How? How did you find me?
Gus.
Gus Atwater.
Gus?
Gus.
Can I... can I get up now?
Please?
How did you know to get to Gus?
I... interviewed your friends.
Who?
Wendell and Leroy. I figured they'd...
Wait a minute, you hit my face, you son of bitch!
I'm not gonna stay here.
What did you take the horse for?
You're crazy.
- Does anybody else know about Gus?
- No. No. And nobody knows anything...
Oh, I'm crazy? You go off with somebody else's $12 million horse, and I'm crazy?!
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Don't you hit me!
- Did you scare that old man?
- No.
Does anybody else know you're here?
No. Nobody knows anything. I don't have any reason to tell anybody anything.
Go away. Go home.
Well, what are you gonna do with him?
Look, just tell me why you took the horse.
You can't race him. You can't sell him.
And you're not gonna start your own cereal company.
I mean, what the hell do you want?
Oh, can't you just answer one question?
Look, I don't have anything against you.
I don't usually get hit doing this, but...
What do you expect, sneakin' up like some cat?
I tried to call, but your line was busy.
Do you know how worried your friends are about you? Wendell and Leroy?
Isn't there something I can tell them?
What is this place?
Does this have special meaning to you?
You want information, go to the library.
I know what you want. It ain't answers.
You just want a story. Any story.
Why don't you make one up?
That's what you all do anyway.
You don't need me to tell you no story.
You ask me why I'm 45 minutes late.
You're not interested in why I'm late.
Just in gettin' a rise outta me. "Do I eat
Ranch Breakfast?" Who the hell cares?
Honest to hell, you people are all the same.
There's folks in Africa, or some damn place...
...you try to take a picture of them, they'll kill ya.
They figure you're takin' somethin' from them, and you just got so much stuff...
...and if other people take it all you got nothin' left.
Well, I don't wanna be no story.
- I've just retired from public life.
- Boy, have you got that wrong.
You rode down the Las Vegas Strip with somebody else's $12 million horse.
Did you think we wouldn't notice?
You're a story all right.
But not yours.
I'm nobody's story but my own now.
But... Wait, wait a minute...
Where are you going?
Oh, I hurt your feelings, didn't I?
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Was it something I said?
Look, can't you just do a working girl a favour?
I'm just trying to earn an honest buck, tell an honest tale.
I don't want to make up a story about you.
Anyway, what have you got to lose?
Everybody's wondering where you're going, why you did it.
The great American cowboy and the worid-champion horse...
...riding into the sunset...
Boy, are you full of shit.
With all due respect, ma'am.
- And you're standin' in poison sumac.
- Oh!
Come on, son. Come on, boy.
If you think you're gettin' away from me you're not, cos I'm gonna follow you.
I'm gonna follow you till you tell me what you're gonna do with the horse.
What are you doing?
Oh, my God!
Now it shouldn't take you more than about 15 minutes to change that.
Goddamn you! You're nuts! I'm gonna call the cops. I got your license plate.
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.
No, you won't. I know what you'll do.
You'll milk this story for all it's worth.
You don't want me to be captured.
A captured horse thief ain't no story.
It was from this hotel that Rising Star, greatest money-winner in racing history...
...and corporate symbol for one of the worid's largest conglomerates...
...was taken late Friday night.
Yesterday I uncovered information which allowed me to locate Sonny Steele.
 Now to raise the old Stars and Stripes.
Where's that blasted flagpole?
Good gracious! A bird's nest!
How clumsy of me. I hope
I didn't step on your eggs, birdie.
You got any shoelaces?
- What?
- Shoelaces?
Anita, get rid of that stuff.
Over here by the cash register.
By the dim glow of a shrouded campfire...
...I saw Rising Star, and I encountered Sonny Steele himself.
- What?
- What?
- We talked for many hours.
- What?!
As a result of our wide-ranging conversation, I formed these impressions:
Mr Steele, in my opinion, did not take the horse for monetary gain...
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
- Where was he?
- I forgot.
- How were you able to find him?
- That's my job.
- What did he tell you, Hallie?
- Nothing.
Miss Martin, if you want a story, we could put you right in the middle of the story.
We could guarantee that you get first crack at everything.
I've already had first crack at everything.
Suppose we made it exclusive?
How about if we gave you exclusive footage on the capture?
Oh, when are you planning that?
Wanna tell me about that confrontation with Steele at the reception, Mr Sears?
- Miss Martin, we could take you to court.
- You could try.
Aiding a felon during the commission of a felonious act, concealment of a felony...
"Misprision of felony", the law calls it.
You're not the law. If Ampco wants to take on the First Amendment, be my guest.
That oughta sell a whole lot of breakfast cereal.
I'll be around, if you wanna handcuff me later.
- We could take her to court.
- Have her locked up.
And gain what? The last thing we need is a female martyr.
At least he didn't say anything about mistreating the horse.
- Do we know that?
- I think she'd have said something.
You "think". It's a chance we can't afford to take.
Do we have a choice?
We could make sure that if he speaks to anyone he won't be believed.
Can you get to the media by the 11 o'clock news?
How the hell did she find him, we ain't even heard from him?
We sent her over there, that's how she found him.
Well, she buddied up to me. She tried to buy me drinks, said she liked my ring...
She liked your ring, she liked my watch, I liked her eyes...
That's how those people are. They tell you they're your friend, and they use you.
Well, what are we gonna do?
I don't know about you.
I'm gonna get a bottle of tequila...
...one of those keno girls that can suck the chrome off a trailer hitch, and kick back.
10.59 here at KLSG in St George, and here's Harvey Del Rio...
If I could drive sleepin' the way you sleep standin', boy, we'd have this licked.
In Las Vegas, investigators still have no leads to the whereabouts of Rising Star,...
...whose ab duction by Sonny Steele triggered a massive search.
Ampco officials are expressing alarm over the welfare of the horse.
According to one, Steele has a long history of alcoholism and drug abuse.
He's appeared in public in an intoxicated state on several occasions,...
...and has been abusive to press and public.
They believe if the horse is to survive, time is of the essence.
Excuse me, Miss Martin?
I'm Charlotta Steele.
- I was married to Sonny.
- Yes, I know.
I don't mean to bother you, but
I was just wonderin' if he was all right.
- He isn't hurt?
- No.
- Are you gonna be seein' him again?
- Well, we haven't made any plans. Why?
Just wonderin'.
- Why do you think he did it?
- I don't know.
He gets ornery. Guess it takes him a long time to admit he's got a horn in his gut.
What is the horn in his gut, Mrs Steele?
All's I know is he musta had a good reason, or he woulda been back by now.
He's no thief by nature.
I mean, it takes your breath!
You know, they only said those bad things about him.
They didn't say what's decent. Even though it is hard to find it sometimes.
How'd you meet Sonny?
Hallie Martin, please.
- What?
- You alone?
- Who is this?
- Are you alone?
OK, fella, say your dirties. Get it over with.
It's time for another wide-rangin' conversation.
- Hello?
- Is it you?
Right from the dim glow of the shrouded campfire.
You maniac!
I broke three nails changing that tyre.
- You want a story?
- Yes.
- Can you leave without anybody knowin'?
- If I can't, I won't come.
- Who saw him?
- Some little shopkeeper in Utah.
Near St George, about five last night.
He must've gotten a vehicle.
So if he stopped for the night he should be within 150 miles of St George.
- Who knows this?
- The local police are taken care of.
- The press?
- No, not yet, not yet.
- We'll take care of it.
- Can we cover the surrounding towns?
Taking care of it now. We'll concentrate on Liberty and Cedarville.
You and Toland take the jet.
You can organise this from St George.
- If he stopped for the night.
- He must sleep sometimes.
He crossed the state line.
The FBI will want in.
- Can you keep 'em out?
- They already know he's been spotted.
Then get to him first. Tell him we won't prosecute. Do whatever you have to do.
Just don't let him start up about the horse.
I'm here!
Hey, I'm here!
I'm alone. No troops.
Come on. Come on.
Oh... Oh, God!
I think I've broken my leg.
What are you gonna do, shoot me?
Here. Get your camera ready.
Uh...
Listen, would you mind standing over here with that background?
No, this is all right. Right here.
But I think it'd be more dramatic in front of...
Tell 'em it was dramatic.
You got a colourful imagination.
Listen, I've been driving all night, and I'm not used to being talked to like...
I'm not used to being called a horse thief.
What do you call a man who steals horses?
Have you ever seen this horse race?
Have you ever seen... I've seen him run.
I saw him stumble and fall back, and lose his stride, and pick himself up.
I saw him stretch out when he had nothin' left to give...
...but he found it... somewhere.
And he won.
Lady, that horse is a champion.
He's got a heart the size of a locomotive.
He's got more heart, and more drive, and more... soul...
...than most people you'll ever know.
And they hang lights on him.
Trot him round with dancing girls, ta-da-da-ta-ta!
They'd have him wearin' short pants and smokin' a cigar if it'd sell their damn junk!
They got him tanked up on tranquillisers and bute, stickin' him full of needles...
Look at this tendon. It's all filled up, he's shot full of steroids...
And it's just for looks.
Makes the horse sterile!
So even if...
God, that's what's so damn funny...
Even if they wanted to breed him, pass on some of them fine qualities, they couldn't.
To say nothin' of what the horse hisself is missin'.
So...
...so I took him.
Come on, let's go. Get this...
Let's crank up this little hummer and I'll... give ya a speech. Or try.
All right?
Any time you're... Can you see me?
Can you see the horse?
Yeah. Keep going. I can see everything.
Uh, this here is Sonny Steele...
...and, uh, his name is Risin' Star.
And he's one of the best.
He's one of the greatest animals in the... in the history of... animals.
Maybe they bought him.
Maybe they own him.
But there's some rights you can't buy.
Even from an animal.
Now, this horse earned a better life.
I'm gonna try and see that he gets it.
- How are you gonna do that?
- I'll do it.
Appreciate your comin'.
You got stamina.
- It's a family trait.
- You'll forgive me for not entertainin'.
I gotta tend this horse and get him movin'.
Listen, can I... can I come with you?
No!
Why? I wouldn't be any...
- Trouble?
- No.
- Well, here, let me give you my card.
- Your what?
Card. Sometimes you think of something you forgot to say, or... wish you'd said.
Steele, what are you gonna do with him?
- I told you.
- You didn't tell me anything.
Enough.
- Why does it have to be a big secret?
- So they can't stop me.
From doing what?
I'm gonna turn him loose.
What?! Rising Star?
I'm gonna get him back to where he was, what he was.
It's in his blood. He knows what to do.
He's just half forgot, is all.
But he's a thoroughbred racehorse!
Maybe it isn't gonna work, lady.
Maybe he ain't gonna make it...
...but at least he's gonna try. He's gonna have his own shot at it, that's all.
- Where?
- Where? Have a safe trip back, miss.
Miss, my ass!
Where will you do it? Do you know?
- I know.
- Who else knows?
I don't know. Maybe he does.
Why don't you interview him?
You know you're gonna screw up your whole life?
Goddamnit, I'm trying to unscrew it, lady!
- Wendell says you forgot your best part.
- Wendell? Oh, he's a good man, Wendell.
- Is it true?
- Nope.
- Charlotta says you screw up...
- Charlotta? You got her in on this too?
Don't tell me.
She says you take her breath away.
Yeah, well, that's not hard to do.
She's all breath anyway.
She's, uh, she's pretty.
Yes, she is pretty.
She said that when you two first met you... Oh...
Wait, that canyon where you went on your honeymoon...
- Damn that woman.
- With wild mustangs.
Goddamn that woman!
- Rim Rock. Rim Rock!
- That's why I left her.
That's exactly why I left her, her and her big m... Or she left me.
Anyway, I'm not goin' to no Rim Rock Canyon.
I have an idea. Let's go into town, have a cup of coffee, and talk about it.
My treat.
- Huh?
- I'm not gonna be... No.
I'm not gonna be passin' a...
Now where'd I put that son of a bitch?
Oh, here it is. I'm not gonna be passin' a mailbox, so if you'd be...
- It's got a stamp on it.
- Yeah, first one I pass.
Well...
What do I do? Just take this road back to the broken tree?
Yeah. Same way you came.
Only backwards.
- Don't lose my card.
- Oh, no, it's... Goodbye.
OK, good luck, wherever you're going.
Les, I got him on tape. Talking pictures.
And wait till you hear the talk.
People are gonna eat him up!
Tell me an affiliate between here and
Vegas. I wanna get this on the cable.
Hold your horses...
Hear that about horses?
Les, I am trying to convey a sense of urgency. I want this on the air today.
OK. KLSG-TV in St George, Utah.
Looks like about 60 miles.
OK, now pay attention. This is crucial.
I need a camera crew to meet me at a place called Rim Rock Canyon. It's in Utah.
- Try the Automobile Club or something.
- When do you need 'em?
They should leave right now, cos I don't know when I'll get there or he'll get there.
And they should be prepared to camp out.
I have a feeling this place does not have a Hilton Hotel.
I mean, this is a place horses like, Les, and...
Les, when Steele gets there, he's gonna turn Rising Star loose.
What?!
$12 million worth of thoroughbred racehorse, loose in horse heaven.
Think you got a story?
Stick with the lunatic, Hallie.
Tape everything. This is gold!
- He doesn't want me around.
- That never stopped you before.
Just find some way to talk to the guy.
Look, Les, I'm tired. You get the crew and I'll talk to you later.
Hey, what's going on?
Somebody rob a bank?
I don't know for sure. I think somebody may have spotted that cereal cowboy.
Hello?
Hi. Listen, are you, uh... are you going to St George?
'Less they moved the road.
- You're wearin' out your welcome, lady.
- There's a cop convention back there.
- What?
- I saw two patrol cars...
...two motorcycle cops, a county marshal and a sheriff.
- You said nobody'd follow you.
- They didn't. An expert got me out.
Expert, huh?
Hey.
- Wait a minute.
- Why? You wanna film the capture?
I am in as much trouble as you are.
If I go back I'll have to tell them everything I know. And I mean everything.
If I don't, I'll go to jail.
It's called misprision of felony.
You go ahead and tell 'em.
I'll be long gone.
I can't. Don't you understand? I can't divulge sources and expect anybody...
"Divulge sources"...? What are you doin'?
- Besides...
- Wait a minute...
Hey! Hold it!
What do you think you're doin'?
I'd have to tell them about Gus.
I would.
Ohh! God!
What are we gonna do?
Get on the floor.
- What?
- Do it. Get on the floor.
- Easy, boy.
- What are we doing?
You stay right there. When I go out the back, you count to 60.
- Out the back...?
- Then drive the hell outta here.
- The cops'll chase me.
- You're crazy!
Go to a place called Cisco Falls. Cisco Falls.
There's a lake there at the bottom of some dry red cliffs.
- Well, where is Cisco Falls?
- Find it. You found me.
But, no, listen... You can't...
You can't make it out there.
- There's at least dozen cops!
- That'll be up to him.
OK now, junkie, no excuses. Tendon's gone down, you ain't wheezin' any more...
...and, goddamn, I've seen you run.
Let's go.
No, wait! You can't...
That's him!
He's in Bundy's Field.
- We can't follow him.
- Ten-four.
He's headin' for the dam.
Come on, come on! Do it! Do it!
Go! Go!
Come on! Come on! Go!
All the way! Go! Go!
For chrissake, look out!
Oh, jeez!
- How did he get away?
- On a horse.
On a horse. Find him.
Bring him back here.
Use the FBI. Use the state police.
Use helicopters.
Put out a reward - a large one.
Get the Boy Scouts. Get the Marines.
Where is he, Utah?
Get the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
Have them sing him in. But get him!
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, you made it! You made it!
Hey. There's some witch hazel in the cabinet over the sink...
...and there's an old T-shirt by the bunk.
I owe you one, buddy.
Is he all right?
Easy.
They didn't chase me. You were right.
You should've seen yourself.
You were great.
You were.
Were you surprised that I got here?
No.
It was on the road map. I didn't even need to ask anybody or anything.
Easy, boy.
It's gonna be getting dark soon.
How long does it take to drive to Rim Rock Canyon?
Few days. Only we ain't drivin'.
What?
Cops'll be lookin' everywhere for that camper. We'll have to leave it.
- And do what?
- Walk.
 I've seen him run.
I saw him stumble and fall back,...
...lose his stride, and pick himself up.
- You bet!
He had nothin' left to give, but he found it... somewhere.
...and more drive, and more... soul than most people you'll ever know.
And they hang lights on him.
Trot him round with dancing girls, ta-da-da-ta-ta!
They'd have him wearin' short pants and smokin' a cigar if it'd sell their damn junk!
...stickin' him full of needles...
Look at this tendon. It's all filled up.
He's shot full of steroids...
And it's just for looks. Makes him sterile!
So even if...
God, that's what's so damn funny...
Even if they wanted to pass on them fine qualities, they couldn't.
I could tape a bit along the way.
Nothing that'll give away where we are.
And maybe I could find someone that could take it to the network, like today.
And since you figure it's gonna be a long trip, that would give us...
Oh, no, I'm not hungry, thanks.
That would give us, what, maybe four or five more days on news.
That way, once you set Rising Star free, the whole country will be behind you.
Then I'd just have to keep lookin' back over my shoulder.
- What's so funny?
- Do you want to go to jail?
No.
Well, how do you think this is gonna end up?
Not on television.
OK, I, uh... respect your position.
I do. I don't understand it, but I respect it.
A lot of famous people hated publicity.
Albert Schweitzer, Franco...
Albert Schweitzer... Um...
How you doin', partner?
- Sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.
- You didn't.
What are we... doing?
Going to sleep.
- I'm not sleepy.
- You weren't hungry, either.
It's gonna be a long way, lady. Long way.
Well, um... where am I supposed to...?
Wherever you want.
Where the hell are we, the Donner Pass, for God's sakes?
I'm ready.
I gotta get to a phone and warn Gus.
When they spot that camper they're gonna trace it right to him.
What... what are you doin' with that?
This is expensive equipment, and I'm responsible for it.
- I'm not gonna leave it there.
- We're walkin'. With our feet.
There's no escalators out here, or bellhops.
- Uh...
- Oh, no. He ain't carryin' it.
- I didn't ask.
- And I ain't carryin' it, and you can't.
I've carried this stuff a lot of times.
Where? Up the escalator at Bloomington's, or Bloomingberg's, or wherever it is?
Bloomingdale's. And what the hell do you know about New York?
Ever hear of the Madison Square Gardens?
No.
They got a rodeo there, and it's a damn big thing. And I've been in it.
Well, I've been to the rodeo. Twice.
Did you stay for the rattlesnake roundup?
Yes. I stayed right to the end.
I saw the whole thing.
They don't have one. How are you gonna round up a rattlesnake?
Oh, God. I'm just trying to be pleasant.
You get so worked up about everything.
What have I got to be worked up about?
I've only got a stole horse...
...everybody but the Coast Guard after me, and now I'm carryin' a crazy woman...
...wearin' shoes from Bloomingberg's, that thinks she's seen a rattlesnake roundup.
Go on, pick it up if you're takin' it.
Only it ain't goin' on my horse.
Your horse
Ahh... Here, give me those glasses, would you?
They're prescription.
You wait here with him till I get back, ya hear?
But if you're spotted and you don't come back...
Call your lawyer.
Hello. Can I help you?
Howdy. Uh...
Well, uh, I'm broke down the road apiece, and I wondered if I could use your phone...
I got a friend in Mesquite, and he's in a bit of trouble, so I need to use a phone.
I'd be obliged if I could use yours.
Happy to pay you for it.
- We got a phone. Come on in.
- Oh. Great. Appreci... Appreciate it.
Phone's right there. You help yourself.
Thank you.
- Hello?
- Gus, it's Sonny.
Sonny!
I gotta talk to you.
I can't talk long. Now listen...
- Sonny!
- Gus, please, just listen real careful.
- I'm in the kitchen.
- People are gonna come, probably police.
They're gonna ask you about the camper.
I want you to tell 'em I stole it.
Say it, Gus. "Sonny stole the camper."
My Wild Blue Yonder? I bought it in Elko.
No, Gus. I bought it for you, remember?
And I'll buy you a nice new one.
When the people ask about the camper, tell them "Sonny stole the camper."
Try to remember it.
I'll see ya, friend. I gotta go.
Oh, uh...
Partner, I'm much obliged for the use of that phone.
Here. Five oughta cover it.
Mr Steele...
...I don't want your money.
I saw you on the television.
You and the horse.
I want you to know
I'd be proud to help you any way I can.
Right now, it looks like we oughta get you out of this county.
How do you like it so far?
Edwin. How's the day? Treatin' you good?
Doin' all right. Got the whole worid lookin' for that cowboy.
He's probably over that mountain by now.
I'd go take a nap on my porch.
I wouldn't wanna find him anyway - except for that reward.
50,000 bucks is a mound of cash.
I wouldn't get my hopes up.
All right, you're clear. Come on down.
I don't know where you're headed, but
Escalante's six miles over that mountain.
The woman put together some stuff - bread and cake and stew and coffee.
I put a bottle in there to keep your blood pumpin'.
- I sure do thank you.
- Ain't no need to.
Listen, there's not many people you'd trust $50,000 worth.
You better get on over the mountain
'fore it comes to me what I'm passin' up.
Come on.
Oh, my God!
- Can we rest a little?
- Not yet.
- Where the hell are we?
- Well, not in jail, look at it that way.
- I can't go any farther.
- Oh, sure you can.
Hell, I've known people go through stuff.
I knew a guy... misjudged a Brahma once.
Put his rib through his right lung, the guy could hardly breathe...
He still got up and rode the rankest mare there.
I will never understand why you find that kind of behaviour admirable.
- Gets you up the hill.
- I have to rest... for a minute.
Hey, Steele?
Sonny?
Norman!
How do you know "Norman"?
I never divulge sources.
"Divulge sources"..."Divulge sources"...
Here, get up. Come on.
You sure do your homework, don't you?
Try to put your mind on somethin' else, make things easier.
Get it off your feet.
Do you know "The Star-Spangled Banner"?
- What?!
- The national anthem?
I know it's the national anthem.
You mean can I sing it? It's hard to sing.
Yeah, it is. Why do you suppose that is?
Hey, that's a very interesting question.
Why don't we sit down and discuss it?
I used to be a psychology major.
"America the Beautiful", that's an easy tune to carry.
Why don't we sit down and sing it together?
# O spa...
# O beautiful for spacious skies
# With amber waves of grain
- Come on. Come on, sing it.
- Oh, God!
# For purple mountains majesty
# Above the fruited plain
# America, America...
Halloween.
Ha...
Hal-louise?
- What?
- Your name: Hallie.
That's not your name.
Alice.
My name is Alice.
My kid sister used to holler at me after school.
She'd yell "Haaa-lice!"
So they called me Hallie.
Alice Martin.
That fits you.
I used to bite and pinch a lot too.
I'll bet you did.
It's mustangs. Mares.
They smell the horse.
You know what you need?
A pair of proper shoes.
Hey.
Where are we?
Are we lost?
Lost?
No.
Good night... Alice.
Good night, Norman.
If she's with Steele, then the network will know where they are.
That's the news department, Mr Sears.
I don't think they'll want to give out that kind of information.
Are you saying we spent
$80 to $100 million in TV time...
...and we can't get a simple piece of information?
- No, sir, I'm not saying that...
- You don't ask the news department.
Ask the advertising department.
They'll ask the news department.
What are you doin' up?
Nothing much.
You've had a hard day.
Why don't you scrunch down in the bag?
Oh, I wish it were that easy.
I don't sleep.
Ever?
How old are you?
Not in front of... in front of people I don't know.
You slept last night.
The hell I did.
Not in front of a stranger.
What, are you afraid of what you'll look like with your mouth open?
You have a mean streak in you.
No.
No, I don't.
I still pinch and bite.
OK.
Morning.
I'm still here.
There's... there's coffee from last night.
It's probably cold.
It probably is, if it hasn't been heated.
And there's cheese.
Cheese.
You're all bent. Are you sick?
No. Just bent.
Well... Here, have some cheese.
They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
I know. I'm the one that said it.
- Are you sure you're not hurt?
- No. Just...
...some parts wake up faster than others.
Broke parts take a little longer, though.
I, uh, I would've called a cab, left you a note.
You know, "Call me", with my phone number.
Actually, I'd have left my answering service number, just stuck it on the...
What's the matter?
I wanna know what's botherin' you.
It was just you and me last night.
It's not gonna be on television.
- Is it?
- I don't know what you mean.
The problem is you get up slowly, I get up fast. It's... the way that I was raised.
- Hey, hey! I grew up gettin' up.
- We just got up, and got to work.
I was up before the sun ever hit your room.
Well, then you get the getting-up medal.
Aren't we supposed to be in a hurry?
Isn't that what you said?
Good mornin', Alice.
Good morning.
You're right. We are in a hurry.
But let's say we lighten up a bit.
I think that's a great idea. Lighten up.
We're gonna be travelling together a little while...
Oh...
There. All lightened up.
...temperatures are dipping below freezing in the high plateau.
On the national scene, the search for Sonny Steele...
...is concentrated in central Utah.
KLSG switchboards have been jammed...
- I didn't see any falls at Cisco Falls.
- There ain't any.
Hell, you can name anything anything.
It's like those people who look up at the stars and see things.
Chickens and bulls and chariots and snakes and shit...
What's this guy's name who's supposed to have a belt? Ryan, or O'Ryan...
Hell, there ain't no belt up there.
Probably there was a falls here once.
This whole land was under water millions of years ago.
If you go... if you go slow, take your time and you look real close...
...you can find skeletons of these weird-lookin' fishes in the hardpan...
...long, long gone.
All these mountains...
Hell, everything, everything you can see...
...everything, was under an ocean once.
- What are you smilin' at?
- I'm just enjoying the fact that you...
...that you know all that. It's interesting.
Well, this country's where I live.
- Don't you know where the subways go?
- Not lately.
Oh, yeah, you do.
How'd you know to find me?
Musta been 70, 80 reporters there, but you were the one that found me.
Just had a few hunches and got a head start.
Oh, you had more than that, Alice.
You are good.
Let's go.
Here, give me that stuff here.
OK, I want you to put your left foot right here.
- Come on.
- I don't know how to ride.
You're not gonna ride.
I'm gonna be doin' the steering.
Listen, I'm not interested in horses.
They're... too big.
Hey, he ain't got a mean bone in his body.
We're not gonna get anywhere with you in them spiky shoes. Come on.
- Oh, God...
- OK, swing your right leg right on over.
That's it. There you go.
Here.
- Uh, should I pet him?
- Do what you want. He ain't no dog.
 Doyle Hicks.
Go ahead, you're on the air.
-  Is this Doyle?
- Turn down your radio.
Yeah, well, I just wanna say that what Sonny Steele done...
...is wonderful news for the animals of this country.
 If somebody's poisoning an animal, a person should try and stop it.
 I'd have done the same damn thing myself.
Them Ampco people got no right to dope up a horse.
- What you got?
- Not gonna throw this away, are you?
- What is it?
- Just notes.
Can I see 'em?
They're just my notes.
- What are these, in Russian?
- That's my handwriting.
- Well, read 'em.
- No.
You got a secret?
"I feel I'm seeing this country for the first time."
"Not looking down from a jet 30,000ft up...
...but from the low angle... of a special man who means to cross it on foot...
...leading a thoroughbred stallion to a secret destination... to a private goal."
"To a fairness that he intends to find in these valleys."
"I..." I can't. They're just my notes.
I'm embarrassed.
Nice.
- It's hype.
- Coulda fooled me.
She ordered a camera crew to meet her at Rim Rock Canyon.
- I suppose to photograph the...
- The ceremony.
The sales figures again, exactly.
In the three days since he took the horse, office equipment has been as projected...
The cereal.
Cumulatively, up 30 per cent.
And by closing time today they'd emptied the shelves.
Yes, Fitzgerald, what is it?
Well, sir, there's something here that I think you should be aware of.
- Where'd you get that?
- There are kids selling 'em on the street.
Now that's not supposed to be there.
Or we're not supposed to be here.
You're lost?
About a mile's worth, I'd say.
We gotta get off this ridge.
Maybe... Do...
- Maybe I could get us some supplies.
- We got enough supplies. Let's go.
Oh!
Here, here...
You OK?
Are you all right?
A- OK.
- You sure?
- Yeah. Let's go.
Maybe you ought to sit down.
- You don't understand the problem.
- Well, lay down or somethin'. Here.
And listen to you bitch about my boots?
No, thank you.
No, no. I'm beginnin' to like 'em.
Here. Right here.
Oh... God, my back.
Easy.
Let's take a look.
You just relax, cos we're makin' good time, don't worry.
Hold on.
Here.
Oh.
Little hair of the dog.
Oh!
- I feel better already.
- Yeah, well, don't put it away.
Hey, why don't you get some rest?
I'll go find us a place to cross the road.
I won't be long.
Hi, there. What's your name?
- Louise.
- Oh! Same as mine.
You, uh... you taking care of this place all by yourself?
- Is your name really Louise?
- You bet. Your mom and dad here?
My mom went to get butane.
We're all out.
- You have a telephone?
- It's out too.
Every time it snows up at Marysville, first thing, the phone goes out.
Where's your car?
Oh, I'm... I'm sort of camping out, and my car went on the blink.
And I, uh... I need to get a message to my boss.
Are you gonna be near a phone later on?
After you close up?
Well, we got a phone at home.
I bet you could call for me and get a message to him.
Could you do that? How much do you charge to make a call?
One dollar.
That's fair. OK, let me give you the phone number...
...and when you get him on the phone, ask for Les Charles. Don't talk to anybody else.
And tell him you're calling for me...
- For Louise.
- No... Yeah.
- Louise, in Utah.
- I know what state it is.
Tell him I said call off the crew, call off everything. I'll explain when I see him.
- Shouldn't I say your car broke down?
- No, no. Just the rest of it.
- About the flu?
- No, the crew. I'll write it out for you.
- Her car broke down.
- Oh, where's it at, miss?
Well, it...
Well, it didn't really break down, it's just acting...
And I have to call her boss about it.
Say, aren't you... You know, television.
You've seen her.
- Last week I saw her.
- News. News. News commentator.
It's too complicated, Louise.
Thanks anyway.
- What's your name? Please.
- Louise.
Found us a spot.
- How you doin'?
- Good as new.
Serves you right.
There's a place we can cross the road about a mile south.
Gotta honk on it though.
I wanna get there before dark.
We're that close?
Yeah, for where we can spend the night.
Inside, for a change. Come on.
Isn't there some closer place where you guys take horses to let 'em go?
No. I just usually use the one, myself.
It's so pretty here.
If I were Rising Star, I'd love to...
Well, you're not. Come on.
Do me a favour, will you, Alice?
Don't go tryin' to think like a horse.
I'll worry about him. You just take notes.
OI' Clark Wembly had this place built.
Us cowboys used to use it for huntin'.
Now Clark Wembly... was really somethin'.
He had a voice that was just like runnin' molasses.
And it'd come over the PA system...
"Sorry you lost, Sonny."
And there I'd be, lyin' in the dirt, just havin' been dumped on by some bull...
...just broke and busted, but ol' Clark's voice'd come sailin' across...
...and he'd say "Give him a big hand, folks.
Glad you come. Better luck next time."
God, Jesus! He was so terrific.
He made me feel good.
He made me feel like tryin'.
And he had a big bay mare outta Idaho.
Oh, what an animal.
That horse used to ju...
Bub-bub-blurgh-blurgh, runnin' right off at the mouth.
I enjoyed it.
- When are we gonna get there?
- About midday.
It's been a long haul.
Somethin' bothering you?
- What are you gonna do after?
- Oh, you gonna start with the questions?
Well, when he's loose, chasing mares, do you just... do you just do the same?
What do you think?
You're the one takin' the notes.
You're a... clever lady.
- What do you think's gonna happen?
- You say it like it's a bad word, "clever".
No. I like you bein' smart.
It's just sometimes you're so busy being clever that I don't...
When was the last time you were surprised?
You.
You were a surprise.
I told them.
Wha... Who?
I, uh...
I called the network and I told them you were going to Rim Rock Canyon.
And I asked them to meet me there with a camera crew.
Oh.
And that's not all.
Oh, now for the bad news?
I lied when I said I was gonna go to jail.
I wasn't in any trouble.
Well.
Well, well, well.
What do you know.
Oh, Sonny... Please, don't just walk away.
Don't be like that. Hit me, yell at me, slap me or something.
I already slapped you.
First time we was alone.
- Swear to God I wouldn't do it now.
- Oh? Is that right? You a new person?
It was three days ago.
I didn't understand what...
Yeah. A lot can happen in three days.
I didn't want to ruin anything for you,
Sonny.
- I had a job to do and I wanted a story.
- Well, you got it.
You did it.
Hey, how about my letter?
Did you mail it?
Or is that gonna be on TV?
Oh, please!
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- What I said.
- Why not just take him to another place?
- No.
- Why?
- I want him at that place.
Everybody's done their thing.
Ampco did what they had to do...
...you did, now I'm gonna do what I have to do.
Sonny, you can't go there.
They'll be there. The police may be there.
I can't run for ever. Look, we're either all goin' to heaven or we ain't.
Besides, you want to see the finish.
Well, be still.
Let it finish.
Oh, I don't want you to be hurt.
I've been hurt. I still get up.
Thanks for the worry.
Do me a favour?
Tomorrow... don't take notes.
Oh, Sonny, I'm so sorry.
Better get off.
How soon before we get there?
We are there.
Wait a minute...
The camera crew, they're not here.
Appears not.
Well, Star, what do you think of the place?
They... they must be at another entrance.
Ain't no other entrance.
Well, then hurry. Maybe they're lost.
I doubt it.
Well, where the hell are they?
Probably in Rim Rock Canyon.
Isn't that where you told 'em to go?
They'd be about 90 miles north.
- This isn't...
- This here's Silver Reef. Pretty, ain't it?
You...
Oh, no, now! I never said we were goin' to no Rim Rock Canyon! You said it!
Hey, look out!
Don't get me with them boots!
Where is he?
And what was this about a reward?
- I... I...
- We've been misinformed.
When our own investigation revealed the truth...
...naturally we understood
Mr Steele's motivation.
I don't think there's enough food to last another night.
- I don't think he's coming.
- It's occurred to me.
Well, Star, you wanna say goodbye to the lady?
Hey, boy.
- Swing your tail.
- Excuse us.
OK.
Remember, they're just horses.
Same as you.
Only they've never been broke. But they ain't won no championships neither.
So when you cross that stallion and he wants to fight...
...you remember, you got the blood on your side. And you can take him.
- Is he just gonna go, just like that?
- You bet.
- I thought you guys were pals.
- We are.
Make somethin' outta yourself now.
Yeah. When I see you, Les.
About nine o'clock.
OK, bye-bye.
There's your bus. Looks like it's on time.
Oh. Good.
- How do you feel?
- I feel good.
Maybe not as good as him, but... good.
What did they say?
Oh, they're full of congratulations.
Can't wait to get the story.
Especially now that Ampco has reversed its position.
Yeah, I'll bet.
They have me going to Paris next to cover the elections.
Well, no kiddin'?
That oughta be interesting.
- More coffee?
- No, not for me, thanks. You want any?
Yes, please.
Just a little somethin' for the road.
Ho, ho, ho... Careful there.
Tell me, Norman...
...did you think it'd be this tough to get rid of a pain in the ass like me?
Ma'am, I had no idea.
All aboard the bus. Cedar City,
Richfield, Utah, and Denver, Colorado.
Uh, that story you're gonna tell...
It'd be nice if you didn't mention where it was that we let him go.
Silver Reef?
Be nice if you didn't divulge that source.
I don't know, leave out a name like that...
What are you gonna do tomorrow, Sonny?
Oh, I'm gonna... get movin' on.
Find me somethin' simple.
Hard, maybe, but plain and quiet.
Any bags, ma'am?
Uh, no.
Uh, hey...?
I keep wantin' to thank you.
But then I keep wonderin' what for.
I know. I know. Me too.
Maybe it's for how I'm gonna feel whenever I see you on television.
Guess I'm gonna have to get me a TV.
So...
All aboard, ma'am.
- So long, Alice.
- So long, Norman.
Have a safe trip back now.
All charges have been dropped, and, sources say...
...the Ampco art department is hard at work designing a new logo.
As to the whereabouts of Rising Star...
...nothing further is known.
So ends the bizarre saga of horse racing's most honoured stallion...
...and the man who set him free.
Except for one note of thanks from this reporter to Mr Steele...
...for his... cooperation in bringing this story to you.
This is Hallie Martin in New York, saying good night.

- All right, here.
- Thanks.
Hey, how about a little coffee?
Here you go... Can you use a little of that?
Put his arm in that sleeve, Leroy.
Got a little somethin' to go with that?
- Got his wires?
- Go get my wires.
- You said to put his arm in the sleeve.
- Button his shirt.
Button his shirt, put his arm in the sleeve and get the wire.
- His hat. Where's his hat?

Ooh... It's pinchin' my hair.
Come on, let's go. Here we go, rollin'.
I'm all right. Let me go.

No.

Mr... Mr Sonny Steele!
Well, there he comes, there he comes.
Give him a big hand, folks.
There he is. How about that?
That is Sonny Steele, here tonight courtesy of Ranch Breakfast,...

Ride 'im there, cowboy, ride 'im.
Oh, Wendell.

- Shut up.
Oh, shit.

Hey, Sonny? Sonny? Sonny?!
Hey, it's Lucinda. Lucinda.
Lucinda Fairlee. You...
The JB Ranch trick cowgirl rider.
OK, up we go. Hello, how you doin'?
You don't remember me?
Last month, after the Watsonville Rodeo?
(cries)
Mommy!
I know how you feel.
(TV) Ladies and gentlemen, for Ampco Industries, Rising Star,...
...horse racing's most honoured stallion.
In industry, in energy,...
...in development, in research, entertainment,...
...in nutrition, recreation, and in science,...
...Ampco Industries, the rising star.
Well, I won my rent on that sucker many a time.
- Horse should be standin' stud.
- We all should.
That's the beauty you're ridin' in Vegas Friday.
He ain't gonna ride him.
Just sit on him up on the stage...
...and he's gonna have little rubber booties on his hooves.
Leroy, you wanna sign this?
It's for that Watkins kid.
He drawed ol' Little Venus over in Fairview. Let's send him some luck.
I don't think he's gonna need it.
- You stayed on worse than Little Venus.
- Ain't no worse than Little Venus.
The hell there ain't. Nameless was worse, and he did eight on Nameless.
Well, I ain't on Nameless any more.
And I got no intention of bein'.
That was a little compliment there.
Here's a ranch for sale in Baily. 450 acres.
You shoulda got that place at Spanish
Fork instead of that Malibu house.
Oh, Spanish... What's the matter with the Malibu house?
I don't remember your minding it so much.
You was in the water half the time...
...wearin' them flippers, lookin' dumb, actin' like a damn penguin.
What's the matter with you pickers?
You're not on the bacon-and-bean circuit.
You got room service, you're flyin' around first class, you got limousines...
...ladies in the lobby, the laundry has tissue paper in it...
You're livin' like a bunch of fat oil barons!
Livin'... better than we got a right to.
- Cowboys in the ocean makes no sense.
- Beats havin' a bull tap-dance on you.
- Leroy, get them pants pressed, will you?
- And it beats havin' your legs braided.
And it beats havin' a bull use your head for a floor mat. Don't it?
Ah...
# Momma...
# Don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
# Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
# Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
(all) # Momma, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
# They'll never stay home, they're always alone
# Even with someone they love
(car horn blasts)
We'd have been here sooner, but we ran into these, uh, javelinas...
- Can I have a coffee?
- Just a minute...
- There's no rush.
- There ain't?
Come on. I wanna show you something.
(PA)...tonight's half-time highlight, one of the all-time great cowboys,...
...five-time All-Around World Champion
Sonny Steele!
Sonny Steele appears tonight courtesy of Ranch Breakfast,...
...a division of Ampco Industries.
Well, what in the hell...?!
- That's not me.
- They don't know the difference.
What's your name?
How come you're so cute?
- What time's the press conference?
- Uh, got half an hour.
Here you are, Hallie.
Now, if there's anything you need, just say the word.
We got about half a dozen movie people here...
...Bud Broderick,
Joanna Camden just came in...
...Rising Star is here...
- What are you gonna do with the horse?
He'll appear on stage with Sonny Steele, the cowboy we use in Ranch Breakfast.
You think he's worth coverin'?
Well, there's better stuff.
I mean, the cowboy's a peach of a guy...
...but there's just a lot of "yup" and "shucks", and stuff like that.
He's no interview.
Better steer clear of him.
See you downstairs.
Bernie... So, they don't want us to talk to the cowboy.
- Where do you wanna start?
- Where do I wanna start?!
(horn blast)
Excuse me, please.
- Where the hell is he?
- Probably drunk in Barstow somewhere.
Excuse me, could you tell me if Mr Sonny Steele has checked in yet?
No, he's not listed.
- It's an interesting watchband.
- Thank you. It's Indian.
- May I see it?
- Sure.
Oh, it's lovely.
Why does Ampco say absolutely no interviews with Sonny Steele?
- Who told you that?
- Oh, one of the people at Ampco.
That don't really mean anything, you know.
Sonny hasn't been himself lately.
They're a little down on him. But it's OK.
He's just a cowboy. Sometimes he loses the best part of himself.
What is the best part of himself?
- You'd have to know him a long time.
- How long have you known him?
# Cowboys ain't easy to love
# And they're harder to hold
# And they'd rather give you a song than diamonds and gold
# Lone Star belt buckles and old faded Levis
# And each night begins a new day
# And if you don't understand him
# And he don't die young
# He'll probably just ride away
- Where the hell you been?
- What's he doin' in a parking lot?
I don't know, but he got here on time.
Come on.
Press conference has started and Danny
Miles has waited all day to rehearse you.
- Well, here you are.
- Wendell, what do I have to do?
Well, there's been all kind of hell to pay, so just behave yourself.
Boy, you smell like a tequila factory.
Here, put these Tic Tacs in your mouth.
You'll never guess who I seen.
Rush, and Hawkman, and old Edgar...
Hey, watch it there, partner!
They all send their hellos.
Foggy Tate's wife Louise gave me this handkerchief.
- I told you he was in Barstow.
- Whew! God, they got pretty girls here!
Come on. This is a serious thing to these people. They're tryin' to buy this big bank.
- Hold it. What's in here?
- It's a press conference.
So don't tell no jokes, don't lift up nobody's dress, OK?
- What do I have to say?
- Nothin', if we're lucky. Come on.
John, you had a question.
Do you anticipate opposition to the takeover of Omnibank?
Just a moment.
It isn't a takeover, it's a merger.
- But Omnibank has always opposed...
- We think that attitude's changing.
We've made a generous tender offer for the Omnibank shares.
We're confident they'll accept it.
Troy, you look like you're gonna jump outta that seat. You have a question?
For Mr Broderick.
Bud, you've played opposite just about every great motion-picture actress.
- Yes, I have.
- Who, in your opinion, is the best kisser?
That depends. What part of the body are you talking about?
Print that. I dare you.
Mr Steele, why were you 45 minutes late to the press conference?
Ha... Well...
I'd like to apologise for that.
I was, uh... I was givin' mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a bottle of tequila.
(laughter)
And we lost her, too.
Do you in fact eat Ranch Breakfast for breakfast?
Well, ma'am, I eat steak and eggs for breakfast.
- You were three-time...
- And Ranch Breakfast for lunch.
You were three-time
World Champion Cowboy...
Five.
Five-times World Champion Cowboy, and now you're selling cereal.
How do you feel about that?
- Lady, I don't wanna tangle with you.
- Listen, we've got a time problem here.
You are all invited by our chairman, Mr Hunt Sears...
...to a reception before the performance.
And enjoy yourselves, you hear?
- You got a rehearsal.
- What was that all about?
- I don't know. Come on.
- Rehearse what?
After you circle, you stop on your mark, stage left...
...lean forward in the saddle, face the audience, wave...
Where's the horse?
Bring in the damn horse.
Spot, please.
God, he's a beauty.
Tom, Sonny rides in circles three times, applause, applause, applause...
...then stops on the mark.
Sonny, your first line is...
- What have you got him on?
- A little bute. And some penicillin.
This tendon, it ought to be braced and bandaged.
- They think it don't look right.
- Uh, hello?
- What do you mean, they think...
- Sonny.
- After you stop, you say...
- Your horse is stoned.
How else are we gonna get him up here with all these lights?
Excuse me, gentlemen!
We're trying to rehearse!
Sonny, your first line...
"Ranch Breakfast... a champ's way to start the morning."
Then you look at the horse and you say
"Ain't that right, Risin' Star?"
"If you agree, don't say anything."
(laughs)
It's funny. It's funny. You try it.
(flatly) "Ranch Breakfast, a champ's way to start the morning."
Wonderful. But much, much bigger.
Much bigger. Louder.
"Ranch Bre..."
- There's more. There's more.
- I saw it.
That's the most discourteous thing
I ever saw in the theatre.
Sonny, this is Hunt Sears.
He ain't no flunky.
This it here?
You ain't in no shape to see no Hunt Sears.
What I gotta do first? Jog?
Dual overhead camshafts, fully enclosed drive shaft, dual disc brakes in front...
Each item will appear in several major magazines during the month of July.
As an example of our confidence in the success of these new fashions...
...Ampco will be sending these lovely models on a one-month tour...
Sonny. I'd like you to say hello to Carol.
Hey. How are you?
Well, then let's...
Carol's interested in commercials...
Hey, Sonny, I wanna get my son a horse.
What kind is best?
- How old is your kid?
- He's six years old.
Get him a short horse.
- Hey, Hallie Martin. We met in New York.
- Did we like each other?
That question about the merger - who the hell was that guy?
That was Cross, the Washington bureau of the Times. He's connected to Treasury.
- He shouldn't have been here.
- Spilt milk.
Sonny, here's a couple I'd like you to meet. Mr and Mrs Phillips.
- Hi.
- Steve Phillips, the Million-Dollar Club.
Sold a million dollars' worth of Ranch Breakfast last year.
- Well, the mean-question lady.
- I'm just curious.
- Uh, Steve Phillips, the...
- You know what curiosity did to the cat.
He sold a million dollars' worth of Ranch Breakfast last year. Wholesale.
Are you kiddin' me? That's just fantastic.
- We're very proud of it.
- I'll bet you are. And I am too. Damn.
- I just love that...
- This is Grace Phillips.
I know. We met too.
Everything's going around and around.
- Oh, that poster is beautiful.
- It's a great gimmick. Very effective.
Grace, why don't you stand in front of it with Sonny, and Steve can take a picture.
Why not just take a picture of Grace in front of that picture of me and the box...
...with a picture of me on the box, holding a picture of me...
Then you got Grace and a whole bunch of pictures of me.
Sonny, you know that TV show in Denver?
We've had to make changes in your copy.
I bet it's shorter.
- In a multimedia situation...
- Mr Sears?
Hello, Sonny. It's about time we finally met, isn't it?
- Yes, sir, it's about time.
- Everybody here know Mr Steele?
Like our horse?
Couldn't have a better straight man.
- Can I have a word with you, sir?
- Perhaps later.
- Beautiful animal, isn't it?
- Yes, sir, he's an amazing animal.
But he don't belong in a parking lot in Las Vegas.
I don't suppose Las Vegas is the most natural place in the world for any of us.
Well, sir, I don't think he's feelin' so good.
Let's give him a drink!
Rising Star represents a substantial investment.
You can be sure we've entrusted his care to experts.
Well, I don't think them experts are so expert.
Mr Steele, would you please sign this picture for me? For my daughter Tammy.
Look, why don't I make an appointment with Mr Sears's secretary...
Why would you put that horse on a stage with dancing girls?
- Just a minute...
- I'm talkin' to him.
It sells products, Sonny.
You mustn't apply logic to advertising.
It'll just confound you, believe me.
Well, it just don't feel right to me.
It seems wrong.
All them lights blinkin' and winkin', and girls...
Sir, I used to rodeo.
- And I was good at it.
- That's irrelevant.
To who?
This is a conversation we might have some other time.
Would it matter?
What matters is that you fulfil the requirements of your contract.
Which don't include your passing judgment on corporate policy.
Nothin' in that contract about me ridin' toy horses.
You're not in rodeo any more.
Actually, you're more famous now, aren't you?
Your face is on millions of boxes, on billboards all over the country...
...people want your autograph...
What I'm talking about is that you voluntarily accepted...
...a highly paid, relatively simple job...
...that more than a handful of cowboys would give their right arm for.
You're right.
I don't want just to be right.
- You want me to like it?
- It would be a factor in our relationship.
Mr Sears, Joanna Camden is waiting over by the earthmover.
- Why don't we have a picture session?
- Excuse us, please.
You bet.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- When this is over, get rid of him.
- Charlotta! Hey!
- Got a quarter?
No, don't... don't say it.
I bet that cheque's in the mail.
Wendell handles all that, babe, you know that. Come talk to me.
How is old Wendell who can't find a stamp?
Bartender? Give us a double Jack Daniels, please. Tall glass.
- The lady will take a Rob Roy.
- Orangeade. I quit.
What... What's the matter?
You're not born-again, are you?
Maybe I am.
I got me a record contract now.
All on my own too.
You be sure and tell Wendell Hixson that.
You sure are tough on Wendell. Not that
I blame you, cheques bein' late an' all.
I don't wanna talk about the cheques.
You know what I wanna talk about.
I want you to sign these papers.
You don't think I saw you tryin' to slip out? I left three messages.
Well, now wait a minute.
I didn't get no messages.
Sonny, that judge told you to sign the papers.
- Don't you wanna be divorced for real?
- Yes, I do. I just... Well, I've been busy.
Busy?! Doin' what? Makin' up excuses?
Excuses?
You got somebody now who sits up all night cos you lost your keys?
Or you got a flat tyre?
Comin' home at 6am, expectin' me to cook breakfast for a dozen cowboys.
And cowgirls who didn't bother to look like they hadn't been in your back seat!
Charlotta, yoo-hoo, you got a mean memory.
- Just a couple of parties...
- A couple?!
That light-up suit musta given you shock treatment!
I'm talkin' a lot of parties, and a lot of back seats!
But for back seats, we'd never have met.
And I'll bet you're still doin' it.
Stayin' up all night, burnin' yourself out.
You're just walkin' around to save funeral expenses.
You smile, babe. You get my insurance.
Do you know what your skeleton looks like in them x-ray pictures? A junkyard.
You couldn't get through a metal detector stark naked.
Give me the papers.
Huh?
Give me the papers.
- For real?
- Give me them.
You look like hell.
Well, you look great.
Hey. Would you come up to my room?
I can't. You just know what'd happen.
Yeah.
Besides, I got somebody who really likes me now.
Well, it's not hard to do.
- Who's the lucky fella?
- Billy-Roy Fix.
Billy-Roy Fix?
Is that right?
I guess there's just somethin' about us Western stars.
- (PA) Mr Sonny Steele, please report...
- Oop, that's me. I'm late.
Goodbye, darlin'.
Bye, darlin'. Take care, huh?
(# "Disco Magic")
Well, Mr Steele.
After this number, the motorcycle daredevils - God save us.
And then you and the horse.
Now, listen. You don't start those things until I give you the cue, yes?
Not now.
Not now! Not now!
Open the curtain.
Forget the routine! Go right to the finale!
That was very effective.
This is no criticism, you understand...
...but it's too dangerous to use that horse on a ramp.
He wasn't supposed to be on the ramp!
He wasn't even supposed to be out there yet! He's ruined the whole concept!
# I gotta run to keep from hidin'
# And I'm bound to keep on ridin'
# And I got one more silver dollar
# And I ain't gonna let 'em catch me
# No, I ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
- What did he say?
- He was rude. He was very rude!
- And he wasn't concentrating.
- He must've said something to you.
Well, he was askin' about the horse's tendon, and the drugs.
Drugs? What drugs?
- Well, the tranquillisers and...
- That's done all the time.
They tranquillise the animal to keep it calm.
And the Butazolidin they use for the... tendon.
Mutual Indemnity and the police.
Which do you want?
- Neither. I wanna keep this quiet.
- You may as well know the rest.
Sonny knows horses. I think he's guessed we've used steroids to muscle him up.
Well, are they dangerous?
Well, they make the horse sterile.
Well, temporarily. I mean, it's just a side effect. It's not a permanent thing.
Do we put that on the box top,
"Temporary"?
- It goes away in, what, how many hours?
- Gentlemen, would you excuse us?
- There are drinks upstairs.
- Ah, the world of illusion.
(knocking)
Just a minute, fellas. I'll be right out.
Jesus...
We're not talking about a horse, we're talking about a $300 million merger.
Omnibank will make a feast out of this.
If Steele talks to anyone before he's caught, we have no merger.
Ampco and the horse are the same thing.
If we've mismanaged the horse, we've mismanaged the corporation.
- Couldn't he have called the SPCA?
- What'll we say to the reporters?
- Tell 'em to go to bed.
- It's a little late for that.
And get those morons out of here.
- Come on, Bob.
- One drunken cowboy!
We have been advised by the attorney general...
...that the theft of Rising Star is grand larceny, a felony.
Should this prove to be a deliberate act, a warrant will be issued for Mr Steele.
At this time, however, our primary concern is the welfare of our horse.
What did he say to Sears?
They were really goin' at each other.
Hallie, give me a break, will ya?
- Ransom. What about ransom?
- The man's not that crazy.
He's been tossed on his head enough times. Thought about brain damage?
The cowboy is a little hot-tempered.
He's emotionally disturbed, that's all.
Come on, Fitz. He's made a mistake and he'll bring it back when he cools out?
- Oh, come on.
- Look, let me alone, will ya?
I don't know any answers.
I don't know from brain damage, from cooling out...
Look, why don't you go have a sauna?
Give me some good news, for chrissake!
"Cool... out."
...these days.
- (Hallie) Why'd she quit him?
- (Wendell) Who knows?
(winds tape)
Sonny was married in Gus's living room.
And when that woman quit him,...
...well, you know where Sonny came to cool out.
Course, Gus is gettin' old and strange these da...
...well, you know where Sonny came to cool out.
Course, Gus is gettin' old and strange these days.
Seen Wendell?
No. I haven't seen nobody. They're just runnin' round like crazy people today.
- Buy you a drink?
- No, thanks. I got one. That's my limit.
Hey, tell me somethin'. Somethin' personal. Were you surprised he did it?
Who, Sonny?
Well, Sonny'll surprise ya. Just some surprises are bigger than others.
Like he gave me this ring one day, just like that.
Had old Wendell's teeth fixed for him, too.
- What's your last name?
- Smitley.
Say, you know something?
We got a mutual friend.
- Oh, we do? Well, who do we know?
- Gus Atwater.
I know Gus. Do you know Gus?
Where do you know Gus from?
Oh, sure. Wait, are we talkin' about the same Gus, from, uh, Tuba City?
No, not Tuba City. No, the Gus I mean is from Mesquite, about 30 miles up here.
Mesquite.
You wanna drive?
Morning.
Hello.
- You got any, uh, eucalyptus leaves?
- You must be a Capricorn.
- You got any eucalyptus leaves?
- Just tea bags.
- Well, I need some of them tea bags.
- How many would you like?
Oh, five or six dozen.
- Bags?
- Boxes.
Come on, boy. Come on, son.
Just a couple more times of doin' this and you'll be breathin' just fine.
If I live.
(coughs)
- Mr Atwater?
- # Golden hills
# Round her head
# Glimmer golden hills
Mr Atwater?
You wounded?
- No, I'm looking for a friend of ours.
- He ain't here.
- But he was.
- Yep.
From about this high.
- Was he here today?
- Here today, gone tomorrow.
Like a flutterin' bird.
- Hey, hey, who are you?
- I work for television.
- You know television?
- Yeah. I got one.
Works sometimes. Comes a-flashin'.
Woo-woo-woo-woo! (chuckles)
- Gus, I'm a friend of Leroy's.
- Leroy! Oh-ho!
Yeah. And, uh... and Wendell.
They told me you'd know where to find him.
How else would I know where you were? Huh?
We're real worried about him.
I gotta find him. I have to talk to him.
I can't hurt him.
He came here. Covered with a mist.
You know? Like floats atop a river?
And... and it grows into a cloud...
...and it shuts away the sun...
Where'd he go, Gus?
- No, please!
- What?! How did you find me?
- What are you doing?
- You're hurting me! Stop it!
- Who's with you?
- I'm alone.
- How did you find me?
- I swear to God...
- How did you get here?
- I drove myself.
How? How did you find me?
Gus.
Gus Atwater.
Gus?
Gus.
Can I... can I get up now?
Please?
How did you know to get to Gus?
I... interviewed your friends.
Who?
Wendell and Leroy. I figured they'd...
Wait a minute, you hit my face, you son of bitch!
I'm not gonna stay here.
What did you take the horse for?
You're crazy.
- Does anybody else know about Gus?
- No. No. And nobody knows anything...
Oh, I'm crazy? You go off with somebody else's $12 million horse, and I'm crazy?!
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Don't you hit me!
- Did you scare that old man?
- No.
Does anybody else know you're here?
No. Nobody knows anything. I don't have any reason to tell anybody anything.
Go away. Go home.
Well, what are you gonna do with him?
Look, just tell me why you took the horse.
You can't race him. You can't sell him.
And you're not gonna start your own cereal company.
I mean, what the hell do you want?
Oh, can't you just answer one question?
Look, I don't have anything against you.
I don't usually get hit doing this, but...
What do you expect, sneakin' up like some cat?
I tried to call, but your line was busy.
Do you know how worried your friends are about you? Wendell and Leroy?
Isn't there something I can tell them?
What is this place?
Does this have special meaning to you?
You want information, go to the library.
I know what you want. It ain't answers.
You just want a story. Any story.
Why don't you make one up?
That's what you all do anyway.
You don't need me to tell you no story.
You ask me why I'm 45 minutes late.
You're not interested in why I'm late.
Just in gettin' a rise outta me. "Do I eat
Ranch Breakfast?" Who the hell cares?
Honest to hell, you people are all the same.
There's folks in Africa, or some damn place...
...you try to take a picture of them, they'll kill ya.
They figure you're takin' somethin' from them, and you just got so much stuff...
...and if other people take it all you got nothin' left.
Well, I don't wanna be no story.
- I've just retired from public life.
- Boy, have you got that wrong.
You rode down the Las Vegas Strip with somebody else's $12 million horse.
Did you think we wouldn't notice?
You're a story all right.
But not yours.
I'm nobody's story but my own now.
But... Wait, wait a minute...
Where are you going?
Oh, I hurt your feelings, didn't I?
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Was it something I said?
Look, can't you just do a working girl a favour?
I'm just trying to earn an honest buck, tell an honest tale.
I don't want to make up a story about you.
Anyway, what have you got to lose?
Everybody's wondering where you're going, why you did it.
The great American cowboy and the world-champion horse...
...riding into the sunset...
Boy, are you full of shit.
With all due respect, ma'am.
- And you're standin' in poison sumac.
- Oh!
Come on, son. Come on, boy.
If you think you're gettin' away from me you're not, cos I'm gonna follow you.
I'm gonna follow you till you tell me what you're gonna do with the horse.
What are you doing?
Oh, my God!
Now it shouldn't take you more than about 15 minutes to change that.
Goddamn you! You're nuts! I'm gonna call the cops. I got your license plate.
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.
No, you won't. I know what you'll do.
You'll milk this story for all it's worth.
You don't want me to be captured.
A captured horse thief ain't no story.
It was from this hotel that Rising Star, greatest money-winner in racing history...
...and corporate symbol for one of the world's largest conglomerates...
...was taken late Friday night.
Yesterday I uncovered information which allowed me to locate Sonny Steele.
(Mr Magoo on TV) Now to raise the old Stars and Stripes.
Where's that blasted flagpole?
Good gracious! A bird's nest!
How clumsy of me. I hope
I didn't step on your eggs, birdie.
You got any shoelaces?
- What?
- Shoelaces?
Anita, get rid of that stuff.
Over here by the cash register.
By the dim glow of a shrouded campfire...
...I saw Rising Star, and I encountered Sonny Steele himself.
- What?
- What?
- We talked for many hours.
- What?!
As a result of our wide-ranging conversation, I formed these impressions:
Mr Steele, in my opinion, did not take the horse for monetary gain...
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
- Where was he?
- I forgot.
- How were you able to find him?
- That's my job.
- What did he tell you, Hallie?
- Nothing.
Miss Martin, if you want a story, we could put you right in the middle of the story.
We could guarantee that you get first crack at everything.
I've already had first crack at everything.
Suppose we made it exclusive?
How about if we gave you exclusive footage on the capture?
Oh, when are you planning that?
Wanna tell me about that confrontation with Steele at the reception, Mr Sears?
- Miss Martin, we could take you to court.
- You could try.
Aiding a felon during the commission of a felonious act, concealment of a felony...
"Misprision of felony", the law calls it.
You're not the law. If Ampco wants to take on the First Amendment, be my guest.
That oughta sell a whole lot of breakfast cereal.
I'll be around, if you wanna handcuff me later.
- We could take her to court.
- Have her locked up.
And gain what? The last thing we need is a female martyr.
At least he didn't say anything about mistreating the horse.
- Do we know that?
- I think she'd have said something.
You "think". It's a chance we can't afford to take.
Do we have a choice?
We could make sure that if he speaks to anyone he won't be believed.
Can you get to the media by the 11 o'clock news?
How the hell did she find him, we ain't even heard from him?
We sent her over there, that's how she found him.
Well, she buddied up to me. She tried to buy me drinks, said she liked my ring...
She liked your ring, she liked my watch, I liked her eyes...
That's how those people are. They tell you they're your friend, and they use you.
Well, what are we gonna do?
I don't know about you.
I'm gonna get a bottle of tequila...
...one of those keno girls that can suck the chrome off a trailer hitch, and kick back.
10.59 here at KLSG in St George, and here's Harvey Del Rio...
If I could drive sleepin' the way you sleep standin', boy, we'd have this licked.
In Las Vegas, investigators still have no leads to the whereabouts of Rising Star,...
...whose ab duction by Sonny Steele triggered a massive search.
Ampco officials are expressing alarm over the welfare of the horse.
According to one, Steele has a long history of alcoholism and drug abuse.
He's appeared in public in an intoxicated state on several occasions,...
...and has been abusive to press and public.
They believe if the horse is to survive, time is of the essence.
Excuse me, Miss Martin?
I'm Charlotta Steele.
- I was married to Sonny.
- Yes, I know.
I don't mean to bother you, but
I was just wonderin' if he was all right.
- He isn't hurt?
- No.
- Are you gonna be seein' him again?
- Well, we haven't made any plans. Why?
Just wonderin'.
- Why do you think he did it?
- I don't know.
He gets ornery. Guess it takes him a long time to admit he's got a horn in his gut.
What is the horn in his gut, Mrs Steele?
All's I know is he musta had a good reason, or he woulda been back by now.
He's no thief by nature.
I mean, it takes your breath!
You know, they only said those bad things about him.
They didn't say what's decent. Even though it is hard to find it sometimes.
How'd you meet Sonny?
Hallie Martin, please.
(rings)
- What?
- You alone?
- Who is this?
- Are you alone?
OK, fella, say your dirties. Get it over with.
It's time for another wide-rangin' conversation.
- Hello?
- Is it you?
Right from the dim glow of the shrouded campfire.
You maniac!
I broke three nails changing that tyre.
- You want a story?
- Yes.
- Can you leave without anybody knowin'?
- If I can't, I won't come.
- Who saw him?
- Some little shopkeeper in Utah.
Near St George, about five last night.
He must've gotten a vehicle.
So if he stopped for the night he should be within 150 miles of St George.
- Who knows this?
- The local police are taken care of.
- The press?
- No, not yet, not yet.
- We'll take care of it.
- Can we cover the surrounding towns?
Taking care of it now. We'll concentrate on Liberty and Cedarville.
You and Toland take the jet.
You can organise this from St George.
- If he stopped for the night.
- He must sleep sometimes.
He crossed the state line.
The FBI will want in.
- Can you keep 'em out?
- They already know he's been spotted.
Then get to him first. Tell him we won't prosecute. Do whatever you have to do.
Just don't let him start up about the horse.
I'm here!
Hey, I'm here!
I'm alone. No troops.
Come on. Come on.
Oh... Oh, God!
I think I've broken my leg.
What are you gonna do, shoot me?
Here. Get your camera ready.
Uh...
Listen, would you mind standing over here with that background?
No, this is all right. Right here.
But I think it'd be more dramatic in front of...
Tell 'em it was dramatic.
You got a colourful imagination.
Listen, I've been driving all night, and I'm not used to being talked to like...
I'm not used to being called a horse thief.
What do you call a man who steals horses?
Have you ever seen this horse race?
Have you ever seen... I've seen him run.
I saw him stumble and fall back, and lose his stride, and pick himself up.
I saw him stretch out when he had nothin' left to give...
...but he found it... somewhere.
And he won.
Lady, that horse is a champion.
He's got a heart the size of a locomotive.
He's got more heart, and more drive, and more... soul...
...than most people you'll ever know.
And they hang lights on him.
Trot him round with dancing girls, ta-da-da-ta-ta!
They'd have him wearin' short pants and smokin' a cigar if it'd sell their damn junk!
They got him tanked up on tranquillisers and bute, stickin' him full of needles...
Look at this tendon. It's all filled up, he's shot full of steroids...
And it's just for looks.
Makes the horse sterile!
So even if...
God, that's what's so damn funny...
Even if they wanted to breed him, pass on some of them fine qualities, they couldn't.
To say nothin' of what the horse hisself is missin'.
So...
...so I took him.
Come on, let's go. Get this...
Let's crank up this little hummer and I'll... give ya a speech. Or try.
All right?
Any time you're... Can you see me?
Can you see the horse?
Yeah. Keep going. I can see everything.
Uh, this here is Sonny Steele...
...and, uh, his name is Risin' Star.
And he's one of the best.
He's one of the greatest animals in the... in the history of... animals.
Maybe they bought him.
Maybe they own him.
But there's some rights you can't buy.
Even from an animal.
Now, this horse earned a better life.
I'm gonna try and see that he gets it.
- How are you gonna do that?
- I'll do it.
Appreciate your comin'.
You got stamina.
- It's a family trait.
- You'll forgive me for not entertainin'.
I gotta tend this horse and get him movin'.
Listen, can I... can I come with you?
No!
Why? I wouldn't be any...
- Trouble?
- No.
- Well, here, let me give you my card.
- Your what?
Card. Sometimes you think of something you forgot to say, or... wish you'd said.
Steele, what are you gonna do with him?
- I told you.
- You didn't tell me anything.
Enough.
- Why does it have to be a big secret?
- So they can't stop me.
From doing what?
I'm gonna turn him loose.
What?! Rising Star?
I'm gonna get him back to where he was, what he was.
It's in his blood. He knows what to do.
He's just half forgot, is all.
But he's a thoroughbred racehorse!
Maybe it isn't gonna work, lady.
Maybe he ain't gonna make it...
...but at least he's gonna try. He's gonna have his own shot at it, that's all.
- Where?
- Where? Have a safe trip back, miss.
Miss, my ass!
Where will you do it? Do you know?
- I know.
- Who else knows?
I don't know. Maybe he does.
Why don't you interview him?
You know you're gonna screw up your whole life?
Goddamnit, I'm trying to unscrew it, lady!
- Wendell says you forgot your best part.
- Wendell? Oh, he's a good man, Wendell.
- Is it true?
- Nope.
- Charlotta says you screw up...
- Charlotta? You got her in on this too?
Don't tell me.
She says you take her breath away.
Yeah, well, that's not hard to do.
She's all breath anyway.
She's, uh, she's pretty.
Yes, she is pretty.
She said that when you two first met you... Oh...
Wait, that canyon where you went on your honeymoon...
- Damn that woman.
- With wild mustangs.
Goddamn that woman!
- Rim Rock. Rim Rock!
- That's why I left her.
That's exactly why I left her, her and her big m... Or she left me.
Anyway, I'm not goin' to no Rim Rock Canyon.
I have an idea. Let's go into town, have a cup of coffee, and talk about it.
My treat.
- Huh?
- I'm not gonna be... No.
I'm not gonna be passin' a...
Now where'd I put that son of a bitch?
Oh, here it is. I'm not gonna be passin' a mailbox, so if you'd be...
- It's got a stamp on it.
- Yeah, first one I pass.
Well...
What do I do? Just take this road back to the broken tree?
Yeah. Same way you came.
Only backwards.
- Don't lose my card.
- Oh, no, it's... Goodbye.
OK, good luck, wherever you're going.
Les, I got him on tape. Talking pictures.
And wait till you hear the talk.
People are gonna eat him up!
Tell me an affiliate between here and
Vegas. I wanna get this on the cable.
Hold your horses... (laughs)
Hear that about horses?
Les, I am trying to convey a sense of urgency. I want this on the air today.
OK. KLSG- TV in St George, Utah.
Looks like about 60 miles.
OK, now pay attention. This is crucial.
I need a camera crew to meet me at a place called Rim Rock Canyon. It's in Utah.
- Try the Automobile Club or something.
- When do you need 'em?
They should leave right now, cos I don't know when I'll get there or he'll get there.
And they should be prepared to camp out.
I have a feeling this place does not have a Hilton Hotel.
I mean, this is a place horses like, Les, and...
Les, when Steele gets there, he's gonna turn Rising Star loose.
What?!
$12 million worth of thoroughbred racehorse, loose in horse heaven.
Think you got a story?
Stick with the lunatic, Hallie.
Tape everything. This is gold!
- He doesn't want me around.
- That never stopped you before.
Just find some way to talk to the guy.
Look, Les, I'm tired. You get the crew and I'll talk to you later.
Hey, what's going on?
Somebody rob a bank?
I don't know for sure. I think somebody may have spotted that cereal cowboy.
Hello?
Hi. Listen, are you, uh... are you going to St George?
'Less they moved the road.
- You're wearin' out your welcome, lady.
- There's a cop convention back there.
- What?
- I saw two patrol cars...
...two motorcycle cops, a county marshal and a sheriff.
- You said nobody'd follow you.
- They didn't. An expert got me out.
Expert, huh?
Hey.
- Wait a minute.
- Why? You wanna film the capture?
I am in as much trouble as you are.
If I go back I'll have to tell them everything I know. And I mean everything.
If I don't, I'll go to jail.
It's called misprision of felony.
You go ahead and tell 'em.
I'll be long gone.
I can't. Don't you understand? I can't divulge sources and expect anybody...
"Divulge sources"...? What are you doin'?
- Besides...
- Wait a minute...
Hey! Hold it!
What do you think you're doin'?
I'd have to tell them about Gus.
I would.
Ohh! God!
What are we gonna do?
Get on the floor.
- What?
- Do it. Get on the floor.
- Easy, boy.
- What are we doing?
You stay right there. When I go out the back, you count to 60.
- Out the back...?
- Then drive the hell outta here.
- The cops'll chase me.
- You're crazy!
Go to a place called Cisco Falls. Cisco Falls.
There's a lake there at the bottom of some dry red cliffs.
- Well, where is Cisco Falls?
- Find it. You found me.
But, no, listen... You can't...
You can't make it out there.
- There's at least dozen cops!
- That'll be up to him.
OK now, junkie, no excuses. Tendon's gone down, you ain't wheezin' any more...
...and, goddamn, I've seen you run.
Let's go.
No, wait! You can't...
That's him!
He's in Bundy's Field.
- We can't follow him.
- Ten-four.
He's headin' for the dam.
Come on, come on! Do it! Do it!
Go! Go!
Come on! Come on! Go!
All the way! Go! Go!
For chrissake, look out!
Oh, jeez!
- How did he get away?
- On a horse.
On a horse. Find him.
Bring him back here.
Use the FBI. Use the state police.
Use helicopters.
Put out a reward - a large one.
Get the Boy Scouts. Get the Marines.
Where is he, Utah?
Get the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
Have them sing him in. But get him!
(scraping)
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, you made it! You made it!
Hey. There's some witch hazel in the cabinet over the sink...
...and there's an old T-shirt by the bunk.
I owe you one, buddy.
Is he all right?
Easy.
They didn't chase me. You were right.
You should've seen yourself.
You were great.
You were.
Were you surprised that I got here?
No.
It was on the road map. I didn't even need to ask anybody or anything.
Easy, boy.
It's gonna be getting dark soon.
How long does it take to drive to Rim Rock Canyon?
Few days. Only we ain't drivin'.
What?
Cops'll be lookin' everywhere for that camper. We'll have to leave it.
- And do what?
- Walk.
(Sonny) I've seen him run.
I saw him stumble and fall back,...
...lose his stride, and pick himself up.
- You bet!
He had nothin' left to give, but he found it... somewhere.
...and more drive, and more... soul than most people you'll ever know.
And they hang lights on him.
Trot him round with dancing girls, ta-da-da-ta-ta!
They'd have him wearin' short pants and smokin' a cigar if it'd sell their damn junk!
...stickin' him full of needles...
Look at this tendon. It's all filled up.
He's shot full of steroids...
And it's just for looks. Makes him sterile!
So even if...
God, that's what's so damn funny...
Even if they wanted to pass on them fine qualities, they couldn't.
(Hallie) I could tape a bit along the way.
Nothing that'll give away where we are.
And maybe I could find someone that could take it to the network, like today.
And since you figure it's gonna be a long trip, that would give us...
Oh, no, I'm not hungry, thanks.
That would give us, what, maybe four or five more days on news.
That way, once you set Rising Star free, the whole country will be behind you.
Then I'd just have to keep lookin' back over my shoulder.
(Hallie laughs)
- What's so funny?
- Do you want to go to jail?
No.
Well, how do you think this is gonna end up?
Not on television.
OK, I, uh... respect your position.
I do. I don't understand it, but I respect it.
A lot of famous people hated publicity.
Albert Schweitzer, Franco...
Albert Schweitzer... Um...
How you doin', partner?
- Sorry. I didn't mean to make you angry.
- You didn't.
What are we... doing?
Going to sleep.
- I'm not sleepy.
- You weren't hungry, either.
It's gonna be a long way, lady. Long way.
Well, um... where am I supposed to...?
Wherever you want.
Where the hell are we, the Donner Pass, for God's sakes?
I'm ready.
I gotta get to a phone and warn Gus.
When they spot that camper they're gonna trace it right to him.
What... what are you doin' with that?
This is expensive equipment, and I'm responsible for it.
- I'm not gonna leave it there.
- We're walkin'. With our feet.
There's no escalators out here, or bellhops.
- Uh...
- Oh, no. He ain't carryin' it.
- I didn't ask.
- And I ain't carryin' it, and you can't.
I've carried this stuff a lot of times.
Where? Up the escalator at Bloomington's, or Bloomingberg's, or wherever it is?
Bloomingdale's. And what the hell do you know about New York?
Ever hear of the Madison Square Gardens?
No.
They got a rodeo there, and it's a damn big thing. And I've been in it.
Well, I've been to the rodeo. Twice.
Did you stay for the rattlesnake roundup?
Yes. I stayed right to the end.
I saw the whole thing.
They don't have one. How are you gonna round up a rattlesnake?
Oh, God. I'm just trying to be pleasant.
You get so worked up about everything.
What have I got to be worked up about?
I've only got a stole horse...
...everybody but the Coast Guard after me, and now I'm carryin' a crazy woman...
...wearin' shoes from Bloomingberg's, that thinks she's seen a rattlesnake roundup.
Go on, pick it up if you're takin' it.
Only it ain't goin' on my horse.
Your horse(!)
Ahh... Here, give me those glasses, would you?
They're prescription.
You wait here with him till I get back, ya hear?
But if you're spotted and you don't come back...
Call your lawyer.
Hello. Can I help you?
Howdy. Uh...
Well, uh, I'm broke down the road apiece, and I wondered if I could use your phone...
I got a friend in Mesquite, and he's in a bit of trouble, so I need to use a phone.
I'd be obliged if I could use yours.
Happy to pay you for it.
- We got a phone. Come on in.
- Oh. Great. Appreci... Appreciate it.
Phone's right there. You help yourself.
Thank you.
- Hello?
- Gus, it's Sonny.
Sonny!
I gotta talk to you.
I can't talk long. Now listen...
- Sonny!
- Gus, please, just listen real careful.
- I'm in the kitchen.
- People are gonna come, probably police.
They're gonna ask you about the camper.
I want you to tell 'em I stole it.
Say it, Gus. "Sonny stole the camper."
My Wild Blue Yonder? I bought it in Elko.
No, Gus. I bought it for you, remember?
And I'll buy you a nice new one.
When the people ask about the camper, tell them "Sonny stole the camper."
Try to remember it.
I'll see ya, friend. I gotta go.
Oh, uh...
Partner, I'm much obliged for the use of that phone.
Here. Five oughta cover it.
Mr Steele...
...I don't want your money.
I saw you on the television.
You and the horse.
I want you to know
I'd be proud to help you any way I can.
Right now, it looks like we oughta get you out of this county.
How do you like it so far?
Edwin. How's the day? Treatin' you good?
Doin' all right. Got the whole world lookin' for that cowboy.
He's probably over that mountain by now.
I'd go take a nap on my porch.
I wouldn't wanna find him anyway - except for that reward.
50,000 bucks is a mound of cash.
I wouldn't get my hopes up.
All right, you're clear. Come on down.
I don't know where you're headed, but
Escalante's six miles over that mountain.
The woman put together some stuff - bread and cake and stew and coffee.
I put a bottle in there to keep your blood pumpin'.
- I sure do thank you.
- Ain't no need to.
Listen, there's not many people you'd trust $50,000 worth.
You better get on over the mountain
'fore it comes to me what I'm passin' up.
Come on.
Oh, my God!
- Can we rest a little?
- Not yet.
- Where the hell are we?
- Well, not in jail, look at it that way.
- I can't go any farther.
- Oh, sure you can.
Hell, I've known people go through stuff.
I knew a guy... misjudged a Brahma once.
Put his rib through his right lung, the guy could hardly breathe...
He still got up and rode the rankest mare there.
I will never understand why you find that kind of behaviour admirable.
- Gets you up the hill.
- I have to rest... for a minute.
Hey, Steele?
Sonny?
Norman!
How do you know "Norman"?
I never divulge sources.
"Divulge sources"..."Divulge sources"...
Here, get up. Come on.
You sure do your homework, don't you?
Try to put your mind on somethin' else, make things easier.
Get it off your feet.
Do you know "The Star-Spangled Banner"?
- What?!
- The national anthem?
I know it's the national anthem.
You mean can I sing it? It's hard to sing.
Yeah, it is. Why do you suppose that is?
Hey, that's a very interesting question.
Why don't we sit down and discuss it?
I used to be a psychology major.
"America the Beautiful", that's an easy tune to carry.
Why don't we sit down and sing it together?
# O spa...
# O beautiful for spacious skies
# With amber waves of grain
- Come on. Come on, sing it.
- Oh, God!
(both) # For purple mountains majesty
# Above the fruited plain
# America, America...
Halloween.
Ha...
Hal-louise?
- What?
- Your name: Hallie.
That's not your name.
Alice.
My name is Alice.
My kid sister used to holler at me after school.
She'd yell "Haaa-lice!"
So they called me Hallie.
Alice Martin.
That fits you.
I used to bite and pinch a lot too.
I'll bet you did.
(neighing)
(whinnies)
It's mustangs. Mares.
They smell the horse.
You know what you need?
A pair of proper shoes.
Hey.
Where are we?
Are we lost?
Lost?
No.
Good night... Alice.
Good night, Norman.
If she's with Steele, then the network will know where they are.
That's the news department, Mr Sears.
I don't think they'll want to give out that kind of information.
Are you saying we spent
$80 to $100 million in TV time...
...and we can't get a simple piece of information?
- No, sir, I'm not saying that...
- You don't ask the news department.
Ask the advertising department.
They'll ask the news department.
What are you doin' up?
Nothing much.
You've had a hard day.
Why don't you scrunch down in the bag?
Oh, I wish it were that easy.
I don't sleep.
Ever?
How old are you?
Not in front of... in front of people I don't know.
You slept last night.
The hell I did.
Not in front of a stranger.
What, are you afraid of what you'll look like with your mouth open?
You have a mean streak in you.
No.
No, I don't.
I still pinch and bite.
OK.
Morning.
I'm still here.
There's... there's coffee from last night.
It's probably cold.
It probably is, if it hasn't been heated.
And there's cheese.
Cheese.
You're all bent. Are you sick?
No. Just bent.
Well... Here, have some cheese.
They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
I know. I'm the one that said it.
- Are you sure you're not hurt?
- No. Just...
...some parts wake up faster than others.
Broke parts take a little longer, though.
I, uh, I would've called a cab, left you a note.
You know, "Call me", with my phone number.
Actually, I'd have left my answering service number, just stuck it on the...
What's the matter?
I wanna know what's botherin' you.
It was just you and me last night.
It's not gonna be on television.
- Is it?
- I don't know what you mean.
The problem is you get up slowly, I get up fast. It's... the way that I was raised.
- Hey, hey! I grew up gettin' up.
- We just got up, and got to work.
I was up before the sun ever hit your room.
Well, then you get the getting-up medal.
Aren't we supposed to be in a hurry?
Isn't that what you said?
Good mornin', Alice.
Good morning.
You're right. We are in a hurry.
But let's say we lighten up a bit.
I think that's a great idea. Lighten up.
We're gonna be travelling together a little while...
Oh...
There. All lightened up.
(radio)...temperatures are dipping below freezing in the high plateau.
On the national scene, the search for Sonny Steele...
...is concentrated in central Utah.
KLSG switchboards have been jammed...
- I didn't see any falls at Cisco Falls.
- There ain't any.
Hell, you can name anything anything.
It's like those people who look up at the stars and see things.
Chickens and bulls and chariots and snakes and shit...
What's this guy's name who's supposed to have a belt? Ryan, or O'Ryan...
Hell, there ain't no belt up there.
Probably there was a falls here once.
This whole land was under water millions of years ago.
If you go... if you go slow, take your time and you look real close...
...you can find skeletons of these weird-lookin' fishes in the hardpan...
...long, long gone.
All these mountains...
Hell, everything, everything you can see...
...everything, was under an ocean once.
- What are you smilin' at?
- I'm just enjoying the fact that you...
...that you know all that. It's interesting.
Well, this country's where I live.
- Don't you know where the subways go?
- Not lately.
Oh, yeah, you do.
How'd you know to find me?
Musta been 70, 80 reporters there, but you were the one that found me.
Just had a few hunches and got a head start.
Oh, you had more than that, Alice.
You are good.
Let's go.
Here, give me that stuff here.
OK, I want you to put your left foot right here.
- Come on.
- I don't know how to ride.
You're not gonna ride.
I'm gonna be doin' the steering.
Listen, I'm not interested in horses.
They're... too big.
Hey, he ain't got a mean bone in his body.
We're not gonna get anywhere with you in them spiky shoes. Come on.
- Oh, God...
- OK, swing your right leg right on over.
That's it. There you go.
Here.
- Uh, should I pet him?
- Do what you want. He ain't no dog.
(radio) Doyle Hicks.
Go ahead, you're on the air.
- (feedback) Is this Doyle?
- Turn down your radio.
Yeah, well, I just wanna say that what Sonny Steele done...
...is wonderful news for the animals of this country.
(woman) If somebody's poisoning an animal, a person should try and stop it.
(man) I'd have done the same damn thing myself.
Them (beep) Ampco people got no right to dope up a horse.
- What you got?
- Not gonna throw this away, are you?
- What is it?
- Just notes.
Can I see 'em?
They're just my notes.
- What are these, in Russian?
- That's my handwriting.
- Well, read 'em.
- No.
You got a secret?
"I feel I'm seeing this country for the first time."
"Not looking down from a jet 30,000ft up...
...but from the low angle... of a special man who means to cross it on foot...
...leading a thoroughbred stallion to a secret destination... to a private goal."
"To a fairness that he intends to find in these valleys."
"I..." I can't. They're just my notes.
I'm embarrassed.
Nice.
- It's hype.
- Coulda fooled me.
She ordered a camera crew to meet her at Rim Rock Canyon.
- I suppose to photograph the...
- The ceremony.
The sales figures again, exactly.
In the three days since he took the horse, office equipment has been as projected...
The cereal.
Cumulatively, up 30 per cent.
And by closing time today they'd emptied the shelves.
(knocking)
Yes, Fitzgerald, what is it?
Well, sir, there's something here that I think you should be aware of.
- Where'd you get that?
- There are kids selling 'em on the street.
Now that's not supposed to be there.
Or we're not supposed to be here.
You're lost?
About a mile's worth, I'd say.
We gotta get off this ridge.
Maybe... Do...
- Maybe I could get us some supplies.
- We got enough supplies. Let's go.
Oh!
Here, here...
You OK?
Are you all right?
A-OK.
- You sure?
- Yeah. Let's go.
Maybe you ought to sit down.
- You don't understand the problem.
- Well, lay down or somethin'. Here.
And listen to you bitch about my boots?
No, thank you.
No, no. I'm beginnin' to like 'em.
Here. Right here.
Oh... God, my back.
Easy.
Let's take a look.
You just relax, cos we're makin' good time, don't worry.
Hold on.
Here.
Oh.
Little hair of the dog.
Oh!
- I feel better already.
- Yeah, well, don't put it away.
Hey, why don't you get some rest?
I'll go find us a place to cross the road.
I won't be long.
(door opens)
Hi, there. What's your name?
- Louise.
- Oh! Same as mine.
You, uh... you taking care of this place all by yourself?
- Is your name really Louise?
- You bet. Your mom and dad here?
My mom went to get butane.
We're all out.
- You have a telephone?
- It's out too.
Every time it snows up at Marysville, first thing, the phone goes out.
Where's your car?
Oh, I'm... I'm sort of camping out, and my car went on the blink.
And I, uh... I need to get a message to my boss.
Are you gonna be near a phone later on?
After you close up?
Well, we got a phone at home.
I bet you could call for me and get a message to him.
Could you do that? How much do you charge to make a call?
One dollar.
That's fair. OK, let me give you the phone number...
...and when you get him on the phone, ask for Les Charles. Don't talk to anybody else.
And tell him you're calling for me...
- For Louise.
- No... Yeah.
- Louise, in Utah.
- I know what state it is.
Tell him I said call off the crew, call off everything. I'll explain when I see him.
- Shouldn't I say your car broke down?
- No, no. Just the rest of it.
- About the flu?
- No, the crew. I'll write it out for you.
- Her car broke down.
- Oh, where's it at, miss?
Well, it...
Well, it didn't really break down, it's just acting...
And I have to call her boss about it.
Say, aren't you... You know, television.
You've seen her.
- Last week I saw her.
- News. News. News commentator.
It's too complicated, Louise.
Thanks anyway.
- What's your name? Please.
- Louise.
Found us a spot.
- How you doin'?
- Good as new.
Serves you right.
There's a place we can cross the road about a mile south.
Gotta honk on it though.
I wanna get there before dark.
We're that close?
Yeah, for where we can spend the night.
Inside, for a change. Come on.
Isn't there some closer place where you guys take horses to let 'em go?
No. I just usually use the one, myself.
It's so pretty here.
If I were Rising Star, I'd love to...
Well, you're not. Come on.
Do me a favour, will you, Alice?
Don't go tryin' to think like a horse.
I'll worry about him. You just take notes.
OI' Clark Wembly had this place built.
Us cowboys used to use it for huntin'.
Now Clark Wembly... was really somethin'.
He had a voice that was just like runnin' molasses.
And it'd come over the PA system...
"Sorry you lost, Sonny."
And there I'd be, lyin' in the dirt, just havin' been dumped on by some bull...
...just broke and busted, but ol' Clark's voice'd come sailin' across...
...and he'd say "Give him a big hand, folks.
Glad you come. Better luck next time."
God, Jesus! He was so terrific.
He made me feel good.
He made me feel like tryin'.
And he had a big bay mare outta Idaho.
Oh, what an animal.
That horse used to ju...
Bub-bub-blurgh-blurgh, runnin' right off at the mouth.
I enjoyed it.
- When are we gonna get there?
- About midday.
It's been a long haul.
Somethin' bothering you?
- What are you gonna do after?
- Oh, you gonna start with the questions?
Well, when he's loose, chasing mares, do you just... do you just do the same?
What do you think?
You're the one takin' the notes.
You're a... clever lady.
- What do you think's gonna happen?
- You say it like it's a bad word, "clever".
No. I like you bein' smart.
It's just sometimes you're so busy being clever that I don't...
When was the last time you were surprised?
You.
You were a surprise.
I told them.
Wha... Who?
I, uh...
I called the network and I told them you were going to Rim Rock Canyon.
And I asked them to meet me there with a camera crew.
Oh.
And that's not all.
Oh, now for the bad news?
I lied when I said I was gonna go to jail.
I wasn't in any trouble.
Well.
Well, well, well.
What do you know.
Oh, Sonny... Please, don't just walk away.
Don't be like that. Hit me, yell at me, slap me or something.
I already slapped you.
First time we was alone.
- Swear to God I wouldn't do it now.
- Oh? Is that right? You a new person?
It was three days ago.
I didn't understand what...
Yeah. A lot can happen in three days.
I didn't want to ruin anything for you,
Sonny.
- I had a job to do and I wanted a story.
- Well, you got it.
You did it.
Hey, how about my letter?
Did you mail it?
Or is that gonna be on TV?
Oh, please!
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- What I said.
- Why not just take him to another place?
- No.
- Why?
- I want him at that place.
Everybody's done their thing.
Ampco did what they had to do...
...you did, now I'm gonna do what I have to do.
Sonny, you can't go there.
They'll be there. The police may be there.
I can't run for ever. Look, we're either all goin' to heaven or we ain't.
Besides, you want to see the finish.
Well, be still.
Let it finish.
Oh, I don't want you to be hurt.
I've been hurt. I still get up.
Thanks for the worry.
Do me a favour?
Tomorrow... don't take notes.
Oh, Sonny, I'm so sorry.
Better get off.
How soon before we get there?
We are there.
Wait a minute...
The camera crew, they're not here.
Appears not.
Well, Star, what do you think of the place?
They... they must be at another entrance.
Ain't no other entrance.
Well, then hurry. Maybe they're lost.
I doubt it.
Well, where the hell are they?
Probably in Rim Rock Canyon.
Isn't that where you told 'em to go?
They'd be about 90 miles north.
- This isn't...
- This here's Silver Reef. Pretty, ain't it?
You...
Oh, no, now! I never said we were goin' to no Rim Rock Canyon! You said it!
Hey, look out!
Don't get me with them boots!
(whinnies)
Where is he?
And what was this about a reward?
- I... I...
- We've been misinformed.
When our own investigation revealed the truth...
...naturally we understood
Mr Steele's motivation.
I don't think there's enough food to last another night.
- I don't think he's coming.
- It's occurred to me.
Well, Star, you wanna say goodbye to the lady?
Hey, boy.
- Swing your tail.
- Excuse us.
OK.
Remember, they're just horses.
Same as you.
Only they've never been broke. But they ain't won no championships neither.
So when you cross that stallion and he wants to fight...
...you remember, you got the blood on your side. And you can take him.
- Is he just gonna go, just like that?
- You bet.
- I thought you guys were pals.
- We are.
Make somethin' outta yourself now.
Yeah. When I see you, Les.
About nine o'clock.
OK, bye-bye.
There's your bus. Looks like it's on time.
Oh. Good.
- How do you feel?
- I feel good.
Maybe not as good as him, but... good.
What did they say?
Oh, they're full of congratulations.
Can't wait to get the story.
Especially now that Ampco has reversed its position.
Yeah, I'll bet.
They have me going to Paris next to cover the elections.
Well, no kiddin'?
That oughta be interesting.
- More coffee?
- No, not for me, thanks. You want any?
Yes, please.
Just a little somethin' for the road.
Ho, ho, ho... Careful there.
Tell me, Norman...
...did you think it'd be this tough to get rid of a pain in the ass like me?
Ma'am, I had no idea.
(driver) All aboard the bus. Cedar City,
Richfield, Utah, and Denver, Colorado.
Uh, that story you're gonna tell...
It'd be nice if you didn't mention where it was that we let him go.
Silver Reef?
Be nice if you didn't divulge that source.
I don't know, leave out a name like that...
What are you gonna do tomorrow, Sonny?
Oh, I'm gonna... get movin' on.
Find me somethin' simple.
Hard, maybe, but plain and quiet.
Any bags, ma'am?
Uh, no.
Uh, hey...?
I keep wantin' to thank you.
But then I keep wonderin' what for.
I know. I know. Me too.
Maybe it's for how I'm gonna feel whenever I see you on television.
Guess I'm gonna have to get me a TV.
So...
All aboard, ma'am.
- So long, Alice.
- So long, Norman.
Have a safe trip back now.
All charges have been dropped, and, sources say...
...the Ampco art department is hard at work designing a new logo.
As to the whereabouts of Rising Star...
...nothing further is known.
So ends the bizarre saga of horse racing's most honoured stallion...
...and the man who set him free.
Except for one note of thanks from this reporter to Mr Steele...
...for his... cooperation in bringing this story to you.
This is Hallie Martin in New York, saying good night.
# At a time
# When the world
# Seems to be spinnin'
# Hopelessly out of control
# There's deceivers

# That seem to have no place to go
# Well, it's the same old song
# It's right and it's wrong
# And livin' is just something that I do
# And with no place to hide
# I looked in your eyes

Damn!
Whiskey, let's find us a nice little bank.
What do you know? I'm the boss.
That does it, Whiskey.
Now just for that, I'm going in alone.
Without me, you'll wind up holding a broken chair together.
You say something?
Okay...
...but remember, I'm boss.
Cactus Jack Slade waits in the shade
Pondering his evil schemes
He's a well- known bad guy
Ready to try whatever it takes
To live up to his name
No one is safe from the villain
He totes a dangerous gun
And robbing and stealing
And just plain dirty dealing
Cactus Jack Slade gets it done
Get off the streets, he's the villain
Meet me in front.
Close all the stores
Lock all the doors
Cactus Jack Slade has arrived
- Who is it?
- The sheriff.
Open up.
You're not the sheriff.
I lied.
One, close the door. Two, open the safe. Three, on the floor.
You forgot number two.
Oh, no, I didn't. I did that when you stuck that gun in my face.
- Open that safe.
- The safe is locked for the night.
And only Mr. Simpson has the combination.
I'm just a clerk.
Excuse me.
Got a light?
How about a cigar?
I don't smoke.
Oh, I should've had two...
- What's that noise?
- It came from the bank.
The sheriff's coming.
What are you doing, you traitor?
Whiskey? You traitor!
I'll get even with you.
You won't get away with this.
Traitor! I'll get even with you.
Get your hands off me.
Nobody pushes me around like this.
Here, ma'am, let me help you cross the street.
Are you blind?
Don't you see all these horses?
We'll never live through this.
Watch out!
Are you trying to get me killed?
Oh, this is terrible.
Here, let me help you, ma'am.
See, Mother, safe and sound.
First of all, I ain't your mother.
Secondly, take your arm off me, dummy!
And third, I didn't want to cross the street in the first place.
Yes, ma'am.
Charming, you're gonna miss your train.
Now remember what I told you.
Avery Simpson would steal the candy from a young'un if he got the chance.
- Are you listening?
- Yes, Papa.
- Them shoes still on that mare?
- Hell, yes.
There's enough silver in that hill to make a St. Louis hooker happy...
...but it won't do no good in the hills, understand?
So you watch out for that thieving Avery Simpson...
...or he'll wind up owning all of my mine. You follow me?
One ticket to Snake's End.
That'll do it, one ticket to Snake's End.
Going away on a business trip,
Mr. Parody?
None of your business, Charming.
Well, here's your ticket.
Well, take it. Bite on it.
I'll get ahold of somebody to meet you in Snake's End.
And he'll protect you.
I can take care of myself.
Charming, I'm not worried about...
I'm worried about the money!
Bring the money right back to the house.
- And be careful of strangers.
- Yes, Daddy.
Pardon me, sir.
- I'm Handsome Stranger.
- So?
That's my name.
You have a telegram for me.
Boy, you talk...
...funny.
Well, that's easy for you to say.
What about my telegram?
So I did. I forgot to write it down.
With all that commotion and everything...
...going over at the bank...
But I do recollect what it said.
It was from a guy named...
...Parody Jones. He said...
...his daughter was coming into town to pick something up at the bank.
And that you are supposed to escort her...
...back out to his...
...place.
And then he said something about you owing him.
That's true.
He saved my life once.
I've been beholden to him ever since.
When is Miss Jones arriving?
Miss Jones is...
Miss Jones is coming in
On the evening train
Do I still have time to eat?
Sure, you do. Just go on over to the Broken Spoke and eat.
Broken Spoke? It's a saloon.
That's right.
And this here's a telegraph office.
To send a telegram, you come here.
It's the only place in town.
To eat, you go to the Broken Spoke, because it's the only place in...
Thank you. Thank you.
...town.
Oh, I don't believe it.
Oh, easy. Go slow, go slow.
What happened?
She was trying to cross the street.
Got hit by a beer wagon.
I always say that alcohol and driving don't mix. What a pity.
I thought I heard that voice!
Get out! I'll kill you!
Stop this stretcher! Get that man!
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't have been hurt. Turn around!
Turn this stretcher! Get that man!
I'll teach you when I want to cross the street!
You leave me alone!
I'm gonna make you...
- Morning, Mr. Avery.
- I want to see your prisoner.
I want to see him alone.
Traitor.
- Cactus Jack?
- Who are you?
I'm Avery Simpson.
I own the bank you blew up last night.
I used too much dynamite.
Well, I'm not mad at you for blowing up my bank.
I'm not even mad at you for trying to blow my safe apart.
I don't keep any money in it anyway.
I don't trust banks.
- You know why I'm not mad at you?
- Why?
Because you and me may be able to do business together.
Now if we can...
...you'll walk out of here with me scot-free.
And I'll give you $1000 cash tomorrow.
If we can't do business together, the sheriff is gonna hang you...
...tonight.
I don't know.
- Well?
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
- It's a deal.
- Good.
A year ago I grubstaked an old prospector.
For that I got half of everything.
You follow me?
Now he needs more money to work the mine.
He's putting up the other half as collateral.
I'm gonna lend him that money.
You follow me?
His daughter will take the cash back in the morning.
I don't want it to get there.
If it don't, I'll get the whole mine.
- You still follow me?
- What about a little advance?
Here's $20, which
I'll deduct from the 500 you'll earn.
You made mention of $1000, didn't you?
I thought I made mention of a hanging, didn't I?
Five hundred dollars.
Whiskey, if you behave, we're gonna be rich. Real rich.
Whiskey.
Not you. Stay outside.
Leave the bottle.
That's an uppercut.
That's a left cross.
And that's a two-by-four.
Thank you.
Mr. Stranger...
...the evening train's coming.
I just heard the...
...blow.
It's at Five-Mile Crossing.
Then the train has five miles to go.
I still can finish my meal.
If you want to meet the old train you'd better come now because...
...Five-Mile Crossing is only half a mile down the t...
- Track?
- Way.
Really?
I'd better go.
Charming
Charming
There ain't no woman in these parts
That looks as good as you
Charming
Charming
Don't forget
What you were sent to do
Pardon me. Pardon me.
Would you mind taking hold of these, please?
Well, yes, ma'am.
Wonderful.
You were the only lady to get off the train.
Yes, I was.
- Then you must be Charming.
- You've said it all.
I mean, Charming Jones.
Parody's daughter.
I'm your pa's friend.
He told me to pick you up.
- I'm Handsome Stranger.
- Yes, you are.
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.
My!
- Shall we?
- Oh, yes. Yes.
Handsome Stranger is such a wonderful nickname.
How did you get it?
It's not a nickname.
It's my real name.
- Really?
- Yes, I was named after my father.
He must have been quite a man.
I don't know. I never met him.
How did you meet my daddy?
I never heard him mention your name.
I met him in Denver.
He saved my life.
He nursed me after I got beat up by ruffians.
Oh, dear. Why did they do that?
You know, I don't know.
But like I said, it was a few years ago in Denver.
I saw a bunch of crazy horses running down Main Street.
I finally realized that these were runaways.
So I jumped on my horse and I chased them down the street.
I ran after them.
It was crazy.
They were going faster and faster.
I was catching up with them.
There were children and women and old men in danger in the street.
It was really dangerous.
I tried to save them.
You risked your life to try to stop them.
- I do this every day. I try to...
- Oh, how wonderful.
So I kept running after them and finally I did catch up.
- What are you doing?
- I got them under control.
Get him off my horse.
You dummy. How am I gonna make a living?
That was the only cathouse in town.
Excuse me, ma'am.
What do you do for a living?
And that's the way it was.
That was a brave and noble thing you did, stopping that team of horses.
Why, you could have been killed!
Oh, yes.
There's been a change of plans.
The girl already got somebody to ride shotgun for her.
He don't look like much, but it won't be easy to get the money.
Why don't I just hold them up...?
Why don't you just do that, if you think you can handle it?
What makes you think I can't?
You did such a magnificent job on the bank.
Yeah, well, I've had a lot more experience robbing people.
Make sure you get that money.
- I'll get it.
- Make sure you bring back all of it.
- I'm not dishonest.
- And I'm not a trusting man.
I always insure a risk.
You take good care of that box, young man.
Charming, have a nice trip.
Say hi to your dad.
We could've saved some of Daddy's money...
...by taking only one room.
Oh, no, don't worry about it.
I can pay for my own room.
He was waiting at the station
When the train pulled in
He was there to meet a lady
As a favour for a friend
The stranger was a proud man
Who paid the debts he owed
And it was his time to pay the debt
He owed from long ago
Handsome Stranger
Where do you come from?
No one seems to know
Your business here
With your steel- blue eyes
And pearl handled guns
There ain't an outlaw anywhere
You fear
Handsome Stranger
Where do you come from?
No one seems to know
Your business here
With your steel- blue eyes
And pearl handled guns
There ain't an outlaw anywhere
You fear
Oh, let me straighten out the bags.
Can you hold this?
- Are you gonna be long?
- No.
- What are you doing?
- Tying down the bags.
Higher.
No.
I mean me, higher.
Now, was that difficult?
This is the day we strike it rich.
One, I merely step out in front of that wagon.
That ought to stop them.
Two, I shoot the boyfriend.
Three, I steal the money and ravish that woman.
Leaving that oily banker with his thumb up his dumb.
I'll handle this.
- Did you hear that?
- No, I heard nothing.
There was a big sound.
Whiskey!
Whiskey, where you been?
Why does the banker want him watched?
He needs to be looked after.
- I've never done this before.
- You're doing a good job.
Oh, thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Oh, you're so welcome.
- What a relief!
- What?
We passed the bend and nothing happened.
Yes, I know.
Whiskey!
- It sure is desolate out here.
- Yes, ma'am.
Won't it be awful if we're robbed or attacked by bandits?
I hear they do terrible things to women.
You don't talk much, do you?
I wish you'd make some conversation.
Otherwise, it's going to be a very, very dull trip.
- What do you want to talk about?
- Oh, anything. Surprise me.
You want to see my gun?
Bet you've never seen one like this.
It's like any other gun.
It just looks like any other gun, but it's different.
Oh, really?
Well, tell me.
I'm dying to know.
- This is a seven-shot six-shooter.
- Yeah?
And I had it specially made.
Why?
- Why?
- Yes, why?
I don't know.
- Nobody asked me that before.
- I'll bet.
Ah, I love those Latin hymns.
Welcome, stranger.
You're a handsome stranger.
I see by the guns you wear that you're a man of violence.
Violence is ignorance.
But it's not too late to be saved.
The skies are darkening.
Soon, the rain will fall.
The angels are weeping.
Let their teardrops cleanse your heart.
- It's not too late to be saved.
- Really?
You can be the salt of the earth, the light of the life.
- But you gotta stop drinking.
- I'm not.
- No drinking.
- Never.
- No cussing.
- Never.
No dirty jokes.
The wicked sprung up like grass and the works of iniquity flourished...
...it was so they might be destroyed.
Hand me your guns.
Now, if I were a mind to rob you...
...or perhaps molest your lady friend...
...this gun wouldn't scare you at all.
Because we both know it's not loaded.
- But I want to tell you that...
- Freeze. My gun is definitely loaded.
Right.
If I were to pull the trigger...
...it wouldn't scare you.
- Reverend!
I wish he wouldn't have left so soon.
I think he really could've helped me.
Me too.
You and your seven-shot six-shooter.
Whiskey.
What happened?
Behave yourself.
Whiskey, when we steal that money, we're gonna buy a nice spread.
With a little corral and a couple of cute fillies for you.
I think I'll get me a couple cute fillies too.
Now, go away.
I gotta work this out.
Yeah, this is gonna work.
I like this place.
Let's spend the night here.
Perfect.
I'll take care of the team, okay?
Charming
Charming
There ain't no woman in these parts
That looks as good as you
Charming
Charming
Don't forget
What you were sent to do
She came to town
With her head held high
Cowboys smile when she walks by
Across the badlands she does ride
With a handsome stranger
By her side
Charming
Charming
There ain't no woman
Looks as good as you
What's the matter?
- Do you know which way is north?
- Why?
When we stay overnight here, we point the wagon to the North Star.
- We know in the morning where to go.
- Really?
I read it in one of the pioneer magazines.
Tell you what.
If we cross the river and stay on the road we've been on all day...
...we'll get to where we're going.
- You're right.
- You know, I think I'll take a bath.
I'll get some wood for the fire.
Would you like to scrub my back?
I'd better get the wood.
I knew he'd say that.
I knew it.
Handsome?
Handsome, is that you?
We should have packed a lunch.
It's gonna be a long job.
You wanna Indian wrestle?
Miss Charming?
I've been lying here and looking at you...
...and thinking how fitting your name is.
I mean, it really does you justice.
How did you get a name like that?
It was the first thing that my daddy said...
...when he found out they were going to have me.
Mama said,
"Parody, I think I'm pregnant."
And Daddy said,
"Oh, charming. Just charming."
Your dad.
He's quite a guy, I'll tell you.
Do you have a girl?
Have you ever had a girl?
I don't think so, Miss Charming.
What are you gonna do?
It's going to get cold tonight.
So I think I'm getting some wood for the fire.
What the...?
Respect!
One of these days,
I'm gonna trade you in for a mule.
Yeah, you think you're so goldarned smart.
I don't think that was so funny.
Whiskey!
Did you hear me?
Then what are you standing there for?
Anxious Beaver, look down there.
Over there.
- It's him.
- Him it is.
That's a very smart horse.
Now, that's a horse for you, Mary.
My braves!
We're gonna have a necktie party,
Mr. Handsome Stranger.
You're gonna be the guest of honour,
Mr. Handsome Stranger.
Whiskey!
Whiskey!
I'll tell you when.
Missed.
Rock went behind. Gonna hit the thing.
I don't get that.
It's chapter six.
"The tunnel in the hillside."
Right there.
Did you see that?
Oh, what do you know?
This is a shortcut.
Watch this.
I'll show you how to handle these situations.
Here.
Back up.
Keep it that way.
Keep it taut.
Back up!
Back up!
Do you hear me?
We've got to be careful from here on.
This is Indian country.
- Indian County.
- County?
Whiskey, this book has been fouling me up.
I don't need Jesse James.
Or Doc Holliday.
Or Billy the Kid.
I don't need anybody.
From now on, I do it my way.
Cactus Jack Slade.
Why does old enemy...
...Prickly Jack come to Nervous Elk?
It's Cactus Jack. Cactus Jack Slade.
I come to speak with straight tongue.
Tongue may be straight...
...but mouth hide many sharp teeth.
I seek great chief's help.
I lost my heart to a girl.
- Can't you talk without your hands?
- Yeah, well...
...this fellow that's with her is one big mean critter.
How can this tired old warrior help?
I was hoping that if you and me and a bunch of these braves...
...were to pop out sudden-like at him...
...he wouldn't be so likely to start a ruckus.
You want nothing from this man...
...but woman?
- Not one thing.
Well, I'd take the buckboard.
She couldn't ride a horse dressed like she is.
I'd even give him my horse.
I'm still willing to do him a kindness.
Giving him that horse no kindness.
What's in it for Nervous Elk?
- Scalps.
- Scalps?
- Come now, Many-Sticker John.
- It's Cactus Jack Slade.
Whatever.
Scalps don't put beans on table.
I'll share the woman.
White woman crazy.
They all keep one bullet in gun.
Yeah, I heard that.
By the way, I've been meaning to ask you...
What do you Indians do when you capture a white woman?
Nervous Elk not know.
Crazy white woman always shoots self before me have chance to find out!
All except one.
Who, by mistake...
...shoot Nervous Elk...
...in the jewels.
Yeah, I remember.
For old-time's sake, will you help me?
Me like nearsighted elk that make love to cactus...
...been stuck before.
We will help.
I knew I could count on my friend.
Thanks, chief.
Now what's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
I wasn't gonna give you away.
Come here. I was just saying that.
See you at the camp.
That man is here to steal money, isn't he?
And if you help him, you'll be stealing also.
But you've given your word to the banker.
- Would you go back on it now?
- Uh-huh.
- What about that white man?
- Piss on the white man.
Listen to those drums!
It's so scary.
Don't worry. They never attack until daylight.
Really?
Thank you.
Know what? He's gonna set the Indian back 50 years.
I don't know which is worse, him or those damn drums.
This is the plan of attack.
Go over it with your troops.
- Okay, chief.
- Good brave.
Well, Handsome...
...this is our last night together.
- Yeah.
Tomorrow at this time you'll be home safe and sound with your daddy.
- I'm not really sleepy, are you?
- Oh, no, I'm wide awake.
Good.
What have you got in mind?
- I know what.
- What?
- Want to hear some knock-knock jokes?
- I'll get some wood for the fire.
We attack at dawn.
Chief, why don't we attack now, when they're off guard?
- Indians never attack till dawn.
- I know, but why?
Because at night, Indians too busy pounding on those dumb drums!
There they are!
- What are we waiting for?
- It not dawn yet.
Until 6:28 and 45 seconds, according to almanac.
Chief, you sure your braves can handle this?
My people greatest light cavalry ever mount horse!
- I hope so.
- It dawn!
My braves, prepare to mount!
Prepare to mount!
Mount!
Mount!
Charge!
- Chief!
- Set up field hospital!
Count casualties!
Prepare for another attack!
- Prepare for attack!
- Will you shut up?
Chief, I appreciate your help, but...
...it's not gonna work out.
- My word is bond!
Hey, Beaver, any braves still moving?
- Yeah, chief, two.
- Good. Get mounted!
- Get mounted!
- Four of us will continue.
No fear, Porcupine Jack.
You're in good hands.
No, it's Cactus Jack.
Cactus Jack Slade!
Jeez, I'm gonna do it my own way.
Whiskey!
- Did anybody see my horse?
- He went thataway.
Whiskey!
Whiskey!
Thattaboy, Handsome!
Son of a gun!
They're gaining on us. Come on!
Keep them between the ditches!
Yeah, you tell them! Come on, Bumper!
You're looking good! Come on, honey!
- They're getting closer, Handsome.
- I know.
I don't know what got them so mad.
Well, I'll tell you, I don't know.
It could be...
...those knock-knock jokes.
I don't know.
- Really?
- Really.
But I do know we're slowing down.
I think you better go a little faster, because they're gonna get us.
I can't go any faster.
These horses are really tired.
Well, in a little ways you're gonna be safe.
- What do you mean, ma'am?
- Trust me.
There it is.
You, back over here...
...where you belong.
- That was pretty close, chief.
- Close not good enough.
Well, braves, back to bead-stringing.
Bye-bye, chief. Maybe next time!
And I got all dressed up for nothing.
On tiptoe.
Stop.
Whiskey?
Whiskey?
Whiskey!
Excuse me, ma'am?
Isn't it dangerous to have blasting powder in the house?
I really don't care.
We got 'em.
I don't need your help.
Whiskey, you've got a funny sense of humour.
What did you do in there?
Take another step, and I'll ventilate you.
Nobody outsmarts Cactus Jack Slade.
Hold it.
Like the man said, just hold it.
Exactly what are your intentions?
To see that justice is done.
And yours?
Blow his head off.
- Steal the money.
- And?
Then I'm gonna ravish you.
Handsome, you lose.
What's his name here just outbid you.
Yeah, another half inch and it's out there for good.
Hey, hurry up with them bean-
If you got the money to pay,
I give you a plate of beans.
Mm-hmm.
That's enough for me.
He ain't hungry.
There.
Leave it here.
Relax, Chico, you'll live longer.
Yeah, 'til tomorrow, anyway.
Listen to him, will ya?
There's only one way to find out.
That ain't hungry.
That's famine.
Usually happens when you cross a desert on the run.
Yeah, and whoever crosses a desert fast got somethin' gnawin' on his conscience, huh?
Right.
So, what's on your conscience, huh?
You better check twice.
He's pretty dirty.
Hmm.
Lucky for you, mister, you're just a starvin' animal.
Yeah.
Ah, Señor...
Take it easy, Max.
You gotta last another 12 hours.
You ain't worth a cent dead.
He'll make it 'til tomorrow.
Hey, can you imagine what he's gonna look like when they hang him tomorrow?
He'll be dangling like puppet.
Yeah.
Hey, you take it easy there, Chico.
You get all excited, you're gonna bust a gut.
Feel almost human now, don't ya?
Yeah.
You just take it easy there now, max.
Si, señor.
Vamos, hombre, let's go.
What'd you say?
Come on, get up.
You know, Sage, least you could do for a man who wants to die is to wish him a cross with his name on it.
You just give him your name, you'll get one.
They call me Trinity.
Trinity?
Mm-hmm.
Well, that's...
Right-hand of the devil.
Come on, move.
How much do I owe ya?
Uh, nada-nothing, on the house.
Thanks.
The beans weren't much good, anyway.
Señor, they're going to shoot you.
Shh.
Hey, Trinity.
They say you got the fastest gun around.
Is that what they say?
Yeah.
Geez.
Okay, Chico, suppose you tell us what happened, huh?
There was a gringo, Señor.
He want to make love to my mujer, so I push him away with a little knife.
A very little knife, señor.
Oh, but when I look into his black eyes, they turn white, and he falls down to the ground.
Bada-boom.
He must have hit his head.
Must've at that.
Yeah, I think so, too, señor.
Any witnesses?
No, only me.
Think hard now, Chico.
You mean my wife and the knife, señor?
And me.
Hah!
Oh, no, there was only this gringo, and he want to make love to my wife.
Yeah, I know, and you pushed him away with a very little knife.
Si, Señor.
Hah!
Clear out and leave me in peace!
We'll go when we're ready.
You're the one that's lookin' for trouble now!
Look, can't you see I'm busy?
So are we!
Only one way to let him know now.
Yeah, the hard way.
Go on, 90.
Be good boys.
Sheriff!
Go away.
Scat!
If you want that tin star to see the sun again, you better set our friend free.
He crawled into a woman's bed.
She wanted him out, he didn't get out.
They call that carnal violence.
He's gonna have to go before the judge.
How do you expect the judge to see it straight?
That old bag was his wife, and she woulda stayed there, too, if the old man hadn't a come in.
She was purrin' sweet up until then.
Your friend chose the wrong bed.
The law is the law, and strange as it may seem to the likes of you, the law is gonna be respected.
Now, you got exactly one minute to split town.
This is the last warning, sheriff.
Let our friend out!
Boys, I have the impression we're going to have to elect a new sheriff.
You wanna run, Jeff?
Not a chance.
Hey, you!
Stinkweed!
You mean me?
Yeah, I mean you, rag picker!
I think he means you.
Drop that holster!
Huh.
Now it's your turn,
Sheriff-drop it!
They'll be stiff before they can draw.
What did I tell you?
Madre Mia.
Who is he, Señor?
The left hand of the devil.
Never woulda believed it.
Who's that?
Oh, it's a long story.
He's up for ransom.
You know how it is.
The Mexicans are always wrong.
What's he have to say?
Nothin'...
Self defense with witnesses to the fact.
Write him a pardon and send him home.
No, Señor Sheriff, it's not true.
There were no peoples.
It was only this gringo.
He want to...
He want to make love-...
Oh, stop it.
He want to make love to my mujer, señor.
Here.
It's a bad wound.
Lucky for him, the bullet plugged up the vein.
Give me a hand.
Anesthesia?
Si, Señor.
Yeah.
Oh, that's a very big knife.
No, very little.
Here, have some more.
Here.
Another swig, hmm?
Mm-hmm.
How's the old lady?
The same.
She's always got something wrong with her.
Now, where the devil is it?
In New Orleans, runnin' a whore house.
I was talkin' about the bullet.
There it is.
Hmm.
Put your finger in it.
You gringos are over here with your burros.
That's right.
You make love to our señoras and want to sleep.
Good idea-go on to sleep.
Sweet dreams.
Tomorrow, you can take him back to his beloved mujer.
You're still quick on the draw, I see.
That reminds me.
Thanks for your help.
There were only three.
Yeah, for now, but let me tell ya.
They'll be swarmin' into this damn town.
You'd do better to get outta here before all the dudes in the west fall in to match guns.
Well, I'm not lookin' for trouble.
Yeah, you never knew how to do anything else.
Smells like a distillery in here.
Who is he?
My brother.
He's just passin' through.
He's leavin' tomorrow.
He looked and smelled like that, too, when he came here.
Had to use three pieces of soap to see the color of his skin.
So, young man, if you wanna shake my hand, take a bath first.
Don't wanna catch no tetanus.
Ah, now what's that?
How'd you end up like this?
Ah, there was somebody following me.
The owner of the star.
Mm-hmm.
Downright disgusting.
Hey, gringo...
Two days after- two days after my escape from the penitentiary in Yuma,
I saw somebody following me.
He wasn't after me.
We were just going the same way, but I didn't know that, and I shot him.
Found out later he was the new sheriff of this town, come to replace the one that was killed.
There was this here star in one of his pockets, so I took his place to wait for my men and head for
California together.
I planned a couple of good hold-ups, but I bet you'll manage to mess things up on me.
I don't know how, but
I'm sure you'll do it.
Hmm.
This isn't a jail, it's a cesspool!
Which reminds me- while you were out of town, there was a real slaughter at the saloon.
The Major's men just pounded two of those farmers.
And from now on, they'll eat nothin' but puddin'
'cause they left their teeth on the bar room floor.
Hmm.
Were they armed?
Those farmers don't go around armed.
You know that, Sheriff.
Come on, young fella.
Let's get home and give yourself a bath and see what you look like.
Well...
You get washed up, and tomorrow you leave.
See ya later.
No, you're not gonna see me later!
You sure you two fellas are brothers?
Yep.
Same mother.
Oh.
I ain't seen so much dirt since the overflow of the Pecos.
It's the last piece!
From what I understand, there's a lotta dirt in this town, too.
Well, if you're referring to the Major's men, he just won't let up on those farmers.
He keeps breakin' their bones, and they come back for more.
Hard as nails, them farmers.
Well, why don't they fight back?
Against their principles.
Strange folks from back East.
All they do, is, uh, work and pray, pray and work.
Pray and work is all they do.
What's my brother doin' about it?
Beans-that's what he's doin' about it.
You know somethin'?
I've never seen such an unlucky sheriff in all my life.
When somethin' happens, he's someplace else, and vice versa.
He's always been very unlucky.
Yeah.
If I'd known you were gonna put on them rags,
I wouldn't have given you that last piece of soap.
Evening, Sheriff.
Shut up.
What's got into him?
The usual nightly scolding.
The Major's men?
Yep.
Well, g'bye, young fella.
I'm gonna take my bones to bed.
In case I don't see you again, uh, which is likely, good luck to ya, huh?
Listen, Major, I'm gettin' a little weary of these punks of yours.
Either they let the farmers be, or I'll have to take away their guns.
Why don't you do it?
Yeah, how about that, Sheriff?
Hmm.
They're good boys, Sheriff.
Hard workin' cowhands need a little diversion when Saturday night rolls around.
Like squattin' helpless farmers, huh?
Well, what do you expect?
If the farmers insist on provoking trouble, a few fists are gonna start flyin'.
It's only human nature.
Or, would you know about that?
Now, I heartily suggest that you go about your business and leave me and my men in peace.
Put it any way you want,
Major-— this is the last warning for you and for your chicken rustlers.
What did you say?
Chicken rustlers.
Oh.
You have the strangest way of doin' your job, Sheriff.
And let me tell you...
I don't like it.
Listen, boys.
Come on, slug, pull out.
What the devil is the matter with you, Jeff?
This sheriff's beginning to bother me.
He's a bit too dull to appreciate my position in this town.
Well, he'll learn the hard way.
They work like ants, but that don't soften the Major none- he wants to hog up their whole valley for his horses.
What do you care?
You're not the sheriff.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
But if he stirs up enough fuss, the rangers will get here before my boys, Weasel and
Timmy, can catch up with me.
Besides, on principle,
I hate to see him win out.
Why?
Because two feet this side of the valley, he's got the most beautiful pack of horses
I ever seen.
Unbranded.
Once he drives the farmers out and brings his herd in, what chance have I got to rustle 'em back out again?
So, give 'em a hand.
Who, the Major?
The farmers.
Ah, it's easier said than done.
Can't even root up a-a hoot owl in this here town that's willing to face the Major's men.
And I can't do it all alone.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
No.
A dollar a day.
No.
And ammunition.
With room and board.
And you get ol' Jonathan to cook and wait on ya.
Okay?
No.
Then get your carcass outta here and leave me be!
Hah, hah, hah!
Looks like they're plannin' to settle down.
That ain't no moonlight camp they're buildin', Major.
Not if we persuade them differently.
Boys, show the brethren how to build a decent house.
That structure doesn't strike me as being very sturdy.
This is time for work.
We can play later.
Go on.
Welcome, Major.
Are you sure?
We're not given to lying, Major.
Only to shadin' the truth.
If, by some dark miracle,
I should vanish before your eyes,
I sincerely doubt you'd feel any remorse.
We crave no such miracle, but only for a sense of dignity in our poverty.
Oh, there is nothin' more aggravatin' than a hypocrite.
Now, you came here in a wagon with a few rags and a lotta hope.
A lot of faith, Major.
Yes, and, by sheer coincidence, after a few months, more of your so-called brothers arrived.
And good ol' faith forms a community, builds a house that could shelter an army, and, uh, fills the corrals with livestock.
Now, yours is certainly a very dignified and, uh, lucrative poverty.
It was wild cattle by God sent.
Which, however, you branded quickly enough.
And while my horses split their hooves grazing on rocks, your cows grow fat and shamelessly prolific like you.
We sought but a small square of land on which to live.
But this small square covers over 200,000 acres, my friend.
We ask only a small part of it.
There's land for all.
Bring your horses to graze here.
We will not resent their presence.
No, but they'd resent yours.
Now, I advise you to pack up your goods, your people, your faith, and your cows, and clear out of my valley.
We've come 2,000 miles.
You can go another 2,000.
We have children, Major.
Oh, I hate children.
Major, I've tried to appeal to your sentiments, but you force me now to remind you that we came to this valley before you.
I believe it was the Lord in one of his parables who said, "blessed are the last,
"for they shall be the first."
So, why should I hurry?
It is evil to be cynical.
It's practical.
May the lord forgive you.
Well, I hope so, but I wouldn't count on it very much.
Hah!
Hey!
Yam, yam
Rah, ha'“, hah'.!
Hah, hah!
Let this be a reminder, old man.
Either you leave this valley, or I'll bury you in it.
The choice is yours.
Let's go, boys!
Hah!
Hah, hah, hah!
Yah, yah, yah!
Hah, yah!
To work, brothers, to work!
Hold it!
Who are they?
It's Mezcal and his raiders, Major.
Once in a while, they rustle a few horses from us.
Well, that's very interesting.
Welcome, brothers.
Thank you, brother.
You forget that you are guests.
Why don't you answer brother Tobias' greeting?
He's my brother.
Now, you give this poor brother something to eat, eh?
It doesn't taste like anything.
We have no other food to offer.
You did it on purpose. Yes?
No, it's not true, brother.
You make this mess so you don't have to share it.
No, we'd share anything we can.
Lies, liar! Quiet!
Shut up!
Next time, no fooling around.
I want good soup with garlic and mucho vino!
Vamonos.
You know what that old fool would say if he was in my place?
The ways of the Lord are many.
This is for the sheriff.
By the way, where is he?
He went outta town.
I thought your brother said you were leavin' town today!
The day ain't over yet!
Hey, you wanna bet somethin' is gonna happen now that he's out of town?
Hey, I'm talkin' to ya!
You wanna bet?
Brother Tobias said, if there's anything left over, we can get that nice bread.
Oh, I wonder if they still have any of that bread.
I thought I told you to get out.
Joe!
But we need these goods, sir.
What you need is a lesson.
When I say, "out," I mean out.
No, wait, brother!
Joe!
O-h, Joe!
You'll pay for this on Judgment Day!
All right, but 'til that day, don't show your faces around here. Is that clear?
Go on. Get back to your cow flops. Go on, scat!
Come on, Joe.
Wake up.
Put him in a trough.
That'll wake him up.
Easy does it.
Got a new sheriff.
Better mind your own business.
How's that?
Ask the Major.
Major Harrison denies us the right to make purchases in his store.
Oh?
Now, that ain't right, is it?
Oh, no.
That's what I say.
Be right back. Easy...
Who is he?
I don't know.
He's wearing a star.
Hold it, there.
Give him what he asked for.
You're kiddin', I hope.
No.
Load it up on the wagon, and fast.
The Major ain't gonna like this.
What were you sayin' about the Major?
Hey, you.
Get him!
Hey.
About time someone took care of it.
Hey, what's your name, Deputy?
Hey, you gonna stay on as sheriff?
He don't talk much, that's for sure.
Hey, Deputy!
Hey, ain't you gonna stop and talk a minute?
Here, there's one jack too many.
No, here, there's one Major too many.
Look, Major, it'd be nice if you told your men not to bother the farmers anymore.
It ain't nice to hurt peaceful people like that.
Now, if your men keep it up,
I'm gonna have to get 'em where it hurts.
You sure about that?
Positive.
Ahh, ahh, ahh, oh!
One store destroyed, three heads split like overripe melons, one man wounded, and one castrated, all in two hours.
Just two hours I left you alone-— two hours.
Well, you asked me to give you a hand.
Not like that, beetle brain!
If you'd only seen those girls' eyes...
They looked like two frightened fawns.
Two frightened fawns- they were probably two sluts lookin' for customers.
Hey, where are you goin'?
To the fawns.
No, you're comin' with me.
Where?
Home to get your rags and leave.
Well, thank you, Sheriff.
You're welcome.
This was a quiet town before you came...
Disgusting town, but quiet.
Are you tellin' me?
Sheriff, what are we gonna do about his prisoners?
Do we hang 'em, or do we throw 'em out?
I quit. I'm not gonna work for them no more.
Ahh, throw 'em out, all of 'em, including that Mexican jumping bean.
Oh, come on, Bambino, no sense holding a grudge.
Don't call me Bambino.
Want me to call ya Sheriff?
Don't call me at all, not even if you're drownin'.
Hey, with what authority are you throwin' me out of town?
Authority of the law.
I wouldn't talk about the law if I were you.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, uh, remember, you're not a real sheriff, just a common horse thief, and not a very good one at that.
Evening, Sheriff.
Hey, keep quiet.
So?
I'm stayin', and with this pinned on.
And a dollar a day plus meals.
That sounds like blackmail.
Yeah, it does.
All right, you stool pigeon.
But if you start one more mess, you'd better disappear.
The deputy sleeps in the office.
Hi, there, Sheriff.
Shut up.
Hey, Sheriff... oh, it's you.
Out for trouble again, I see.
Oh, I'm a peaceful man.
Where ya goin'?
The saloon, just a little nip before goin' to bed.
Like to believe that.
How about it?
Have one on me.
Only one?
Well, forget it, then.
Forget it, he”.
Well, looks like the deputy sheriff is layin' low tonight, huh?
First chance I get,
I'll fix him for good.
Yeah.
That dirty son of an old-
Don't try it.
He's quicker than a rattlesnake.
Don't like the comparison, but your friend's got a point.
Don't try it.
Let's get outta here.
Never a night somethin' doesn't happen.
I don't think I like that.
What did you say about my old lady?
You' re “CNN to ska“ a fight.
I asked you a question.
What did you say about my old lady?
You heard it.
Well, say it again.
Don't be afraid.
Afraid of you?
Huh?
Afraid you got more cheek than brain.
Hey, Sheriff, wake up!
Sheriff!
Sheriff, wake up!
Open in the name of the law!
It's me, Jonathan!
Oh!
You better get your hide over to the saloon right away!
What's happening now?
Your brother is over there.
Huh?
They killed him?
Well, he was still standing when I left.
But they'll make a sieve out of him if you don't hurry!
Yeah.
Seven of us, Deputy, and you're only holdin' six bullets in your gun.
Now, I don't know if I make myself clear.
Better pay your bar bill now.
Don't wanna leave any debts behind.
Now, I don't know if I made myself clear.
Hurry, Sheriff.
Yeah, yeah.
What's goin' on here?
They offended the law.
Law?
Yes.
They said I was a son of an old...
That is serious.
How are we gonna settle that, boys?
If you didn't care to hide behind that piece of tin, we could settle this among men.
Aren't you gonna take it off?
They are only nine.
Jonathan!
Ahh!
Take the guns.
Here you go.
Here.
Close the door.
Lock it!
You gonna handle it alone?
I just woke up.
You take your share.
Wasn't a very bright idea, my friend.
Get him.
Get him.
Stop it.
Push him.
Oh!
Hey, let me-let me go.
Oh!
No.
Can I go to bed, or you got somethin' else planned for tonight?
Well, I really came for a drink.
I'm sorry, but I couldn't let them call ma an old-
But it's true.
Yeah, but she ain't that old.
Ain't you got no ambition in life?
Do somethin'.
Rustle cattle, hold up a stagecoach, or play cards, or somethin'.
Once, you were a good card shark, but do somethin'.
Who's got the time?
I'm already busy doin' nothin'.
Who are they?
They're the farmers the Major wants out.
How come they're not armed?
Oh, it's part of their religion.
They don't believe in violence.
Huh?
Oh, it's somethin' like that.
Well, how do they manage with the Major after 'em?
Oh, with some prayers and broken bones.
Welcome, brothers!
Hey, who told him we were brothers?
Hmm? Not me.
It is the Lord that sends you!
Truth is, we was just passin' by!
Then, come!
Come join us, brothers!
Get off your horses and rest a while.
It was good of you to come.
We are truly indebted to you for having aided our sisters,
Sarah and Judith.
They were innocent doves surrounded by evil, but the Lord heard their prayers and sent you to answer them.
Yeah, it was approximately like that.
Sure is peaceful around here.
Just like paradise.
And it is.
For that reason, we wouldn't want the Major to contaminate it.
You're right.
You would honor us if you would share our meager meal with us.
Wanna share?
Come.
Wash your hands first.
Right.
Your guns, brothers.
What?
It is best not to sit at the Lord's table with symbols of violence.
Thank you, brother.
Don't take 'em far away.
Let us pray.
Dear Lord, we are grateful to you for these thy gifts, which we are about to receive through your infinite goodness.
And, Lord, we ask you to bless and protect our brethren who are not with us at this time.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, pass the bread down this way.
Well, look at that.
Oh.
Yahoo!
All the children and sisters leave, quickly.
I beg you to forgive their rudeness.
They're like misguided children who know not what they do.
Hey!
Brother Tobias!
My gringo.
We were passing by when I say to my men,
"why don't we go to pay a visit to my friend, Tobias?"
Right?
Right.
If you care to join us.
No, don't insist, brother.
I don't like to take advantage of your hospitality every day.
Thank you, brother Mezcal, but you're always welcome to share our table.
Ahh, Si, well, then we'll take advantage.
Hombre!
Why don't you remind me to take off my holster?
Don't you know brother Tobias doesn't like to see guns at his table?
Well, now you know.
Your guns, brothers.
How about the knife?
Here.
Thank you, brother.
Here's another.
Bring the wine!
Si, Señor.
Quiet, everybody.
Now,
I make a toast to brother Tobias.
I said wine, not water.
Where's the wine?
I'm sorry, brother.
It's against-
Where's the wine?!
Where's the wine?
Get them in line!
Vamonos, cabron!
You, too!
Everybody get in line.
You're too slow!
Arriba!
Not you, stupid.
You no drink wine, eh?
All right, you don't drink wine, but you make love, no?
No?
Cabron!
Wait, brother, wait, please.
You are not my brother no more!
I think this one make love.
Bueno, the other side now.
How dare you hit one of my brothers?
Ask forgiveness.
Forgiveness, please.
Hey, where are you going?
Turn the other cheek.
This one is new to me.
He's very pretty.
Like this.
You, give me room.
Hit him.
Me?
Hmm.
We go away now, huh?
Brother, I tried to warn you that my two guests here belong to another belief.
They rigidly observe the law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
I'd say that you forgive them and return some other time.
Si, Si.
I kill him, gringo.
Bueno, bueno, patron.
I swear...
Mezcal don't forget this!
Yeah, I can believe it.
Hee-yah!
Hah!
Brother Tobias, that was so brave.
Are they really gone?
Now, you can help yourselves.
You have their guns.
If Mezcal comes back, one bullet in the fire will change his mind.
The Lord giveth life and the Lord taketh.
Our weapons are faith and love.
Well spoken, brother Tobias.
Only love shall combat evil.
It is the sacred word.
"From my body, you shall have the heat to warm your blood."
"And from my breast, drink the nectar to quench thy thirst.
"And from my lips,
"you shall hear only words of love for the Lord."
Thus spake Ezekiel.
He was damn right.
Your guns, brothers.
Oh, and your hat, brother.
Thank you.
Uh, if you need me-
Us.
If you need us, you know where we are.
Get movin'.
Yah!
God is with us.
Evening, Jonathan.
Go to hell.
He'll leave tomorrow.
Just passing through.
In a pig's ear he is.
He'll stay for the rest of his life.
And from what's going on, that won't be too long.
Disgusting-disgusting people.
Only safe thing left to do is blow your brains out.
All right, come and get it.
That Mexican is so drunk he can't stand up.
Oh, he's fine.
He seemed a little sick before, so I gave him a couple of drops of whiskey.
Well, wasn't that mighty nice of you?
I think so, but I always say everything wrong around here.
Oh, shut up.
Yeah, look at them.
Go on, eat my pork.
Go on, eat up.
Huh.
Who knows?
It may be your last meal.
Why?
'Cause I saw two new faces in town.
Ooh, real ugly.
And they don't promise any good.
Oh.
Where are you goin'?
To welcome them strangers.
I thought you said you weren't lookin' for trouble.
I don't like people with ugly faces.
Get the itch outta your finger and stay put.
Hmm.
What would humanity have come to without the horse?
The great Caesar,
Alexander the Great, the greats of Spain-...
Would they really have been great without the horse?
Would this nation ever have been born without the generous help of that noble animal?
Now, what is the best way to pay our debt if not to offer them a quiet, green pasture where they can eat and procreate in peace?
Therefore, I want that valley at any cost.
And if you convince the farmers to leave,
I'll make it so worth your while you'll be able to retire.
That valley is already yours, Major.
Good.
First, however,
I'd like you to take care of the sheriff and his deputy.
Their, uh, zeal is positively disturbing.
You can start electing a new sheriff as of now.
That I will.
You care for some sherry?
It's wine, the best.
Uh, no, thank you, Major, not while working.
That's what I call professional seriousness.
I advise you to watch the deputy.
He's very fast.
You hear that, Mortimer?
The Major says the deputy is very fast.
Oh, yeah!
All right, come on, let's go.
You come this way.
Where are you goin'?
Out-take a look around.
It's a quiet day today.
See that it ends up the way it started.
Wait 'till Jack gets a hold of him.
Yeah.
That's the fast deputy,
Mortimer.
Hmm.
Can I help you with somethin', Deputy?
Anything in particular you're interested in?
Uh, yeah. Would you mind showing me your underwear?
Hey, what about the horses?
There's no time!
He said ten seconds!
I suppose you got nothin' to do with this, right?
Sheriff, this was a peaceful town before this madman came here.
Now, he can't go around hittin' and shootin' our good citizens just because you gave him that star.
In the name of this community,
I demand your resignation and your deputy's, or I shall be forced to speak to my personal friend, the governor.
Uh-huh, all right.
We can't let him get away with it, Major.
Hmm.
Damn the day you ever came into the world.
You're worse than the black plague and a leprechaun.
For the umpteenth time, what do you want me to do with that Mexican?
Oh, throw him out.
But he can't stand up.
Give him some whiskey.
It'll make him go to sleep.
Somethin' the matter?
Nothin' important...
There's a reward out for me.
The new sheriff I took this star from, he ain't dead.
He's lame. He's lookin' for me all over the state.
Now, he wants me to give him a hand to find me.
Hey, $200.
You thinkin' of sellin' your own brother?
That's an insult.
I'd never do such a thing for only 200 bucks.
Wanna come with me?
Where?
Hmm.
You're takin' advantage because you know I'd never shoot you, right?
Sure.
Why in the he” don't you wise up?
Go back to New Orleans to Mama.
Bring her a couple of girls and go into business with her.
Now, beat it.
Move!
Well, so long.
Hope to see ya again someday.
I don't.
If I really wanted to stay, I would!
I don't think so!
Helen, come and help me!
Billy, you get it.
I'll have it ready in a few seconds.
Hand me that ax.
Myrtle, get this kid back to the wagon, will ya?
He's always in the way.
It's good to see you again, brother.
What breeze brings you here?
Well, actually, weren't no breeze.
I'm goin' home.
Just passin' through to say goodbye.
You've been our guardian angel.
May the Lord be with you.
But if you should choose to remain with us, my son, you're more than welcome.
Thank you, but
I really have to go.
It's a pity.
Hmm.
Well, as you wish.
But before you leave, I know that Sarah and Judith would like to thank you personally.
They're down by the creek.
Oh, down by the creek?
I'll get someone to fetch them.
Ah, don't bother, chief.
I'll be going by that way.
They'll be happy to see you.
Oh, look, it's Trinity!
Hi!
Welcome, brother!
Howdy!
Come on in!
Hey, the water is fine!
Come on!
Hey, it's marvelous.
Come on in.
The water is warm.
Don't be afraid.
Come on.
Don't be a sissy.
Oh, he's comin' in, horse and all.
Hey, the invitation didn't include your horse.
Well, he can swim.
I can't.
But the water is only up to here.
Oh, well, in that case...
What is he doing?
You know, when we saw you for the first time, we thought that it would've been wonderful if you joined our community.
Yeah, it kinda passed my mind, too.
You could've lived with us.
Made a home with devoted wives to take care of you and serve you.
Wives?
Uh-huh, wives.
Didn't you know our faith accepts the state or fact of polygamy?
Huh?
Hey, it's gettin' deeper.
Before we start shingling, we better raise the chimney.
You're right, brother.
Help me, brother.
Yeah, right.
Bye.
Bye.
You'll be leavin' right away?
Well, if the invitation still stands, we thought we'd stay on for a day or so.
By all means.
Whatever is ours is yours to share.
Ahh, chh-chh-chh.
Ahh, chh-chh-chh.
There's no way to stop the Major?
He ain't the type to give in.
He'll come chargin' down here before you know it.
Our fate is in the hands of the Lord.
Yeah, but he doesn't carry a gun either.
Can't get much help there.
Look, I don't think the Lord would take it wrong if you defend yourselves.
We cannot kill our fellow man.
But they ain't your fellow man.
They're lower than rattlesnakes.
You can't go on turnin' the other cheek forever.
We shall see what God wills.
I hope he wills a couple of guns.
You could get rid of the whole bunch.
A few at a time, of course.
Listen, I suggest that-...
Hey, look.
Hey, Ma, there's two strangers here!
Who might they be, brother?
Judging from appearances,
I'd say they were wayfarers tired from a long journey.
Or two outlaws escaping across the desert.
Also, the Lord crossed the desert.
Yeah, but he didn't have the U.S. Rangers on his tail.
Go see what they want.
If they start making trouble,
I'll be right behind you.
May I?
"Give drink to the thirsty," says the Holy Word.
If I'm not mistaken, it also says to give food to the hungry, right?
Wrong.
You're Weasel, ain't ya?
Yeah.
And you're Timmy.
And you're lookin' for the Bambino.
You wouldn't know where he's been, huh?
Yeah, waitin' for you to get here.
What in the hell are you up to now?
Hey, boss!
I've been rottin' here for weeks waitin' for ya.
I was beginning to think they strung you both up.
We were sidetracked out on the trail.
We saw somebody following us out, so we detoured around the canyon and shot him off his horse.
It was a sheriff, a lame-legged sheriff.
He weren't really lookin' for us.
We just happened to be goin' the same way.
Did you fix him for good?
Well, uh-...
Well, almost... Timmy got him in the good leg.
Then we broke his crutches.
Yeah.
What are you doin' with that star?
Hidin' behind the law.
Huh?
Now, listen to me.
There's a beautiful job for us, a ripe plum just waitin' to be picked.
Cattle?
Steeds.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
The most gorgeous herd of unbranded stallions you ever seen.
How'd you know I was here?
I told them.
Oh, no.
Now, listen a minute, Bambino.
I don't want-
I don't wanna listen.
Look, I just wanted to tell you...
Oh, go on, get.
Hey, hold on.
Didn't you hear what the boss said?
Hmm?
Hey, wait up.
There's somethin' important
I gotta tell ya.
Comin' to town,
I saw the Major headin' for the Mexican border.
You know what that means?
It means that he's gonna join up with Mezcal.
Them farmers won't have a chance.
Look, if you help me get rid of the Major,
I'll, uh, get married.
You'll what?
I'll get married.
To who?
To Sarah or Judith-
I haven't decided yet.
But I'm gonna settle down with the farmers...
Forever.
Forever?
Yes, forever.
I want to forget the past.
Hmm?
Swear on our old lady.
May she become an honest woman if I'm tellin' a lie.
All right, it's a deal.
I'll help you, but then we go separate ways, or I'll make sure you really forget the past.
Thanks. You won't be sorry.
Yeah.
Uh, listen, about taking care of the Major.
I was thinkin'.
You don't have to think!
I'll do the thinkin'!
Exactly what I was thinking.
Idiot!
Oh, that is the very nice Major.
He's got a lot of dinero, muchachos.
Bienvenido.
You sit here, in the shade, no?
Thank you.
Fuera, fuera!
Buenos Dias, Major.
You, too!
So, how is my worst enemy, huh?
Your best friend now.
But your men shoot us just yesterday.
You see, Mr. Mezcal, if you steal my horses,
I'll have to have you shot.
But if you work for me,
I'll give them to you,
20 of them, for chasing the Mormons out of the valley.
Major, for 20 stallions,
Mezcal conquer Texas.
But how about the-
Uh, I mean, is there some way in particular you would like us to kill those insects, huh?
That's your business.
Yeah.
There's only one thing
I don't like, Major.
And that is?
It's that I prefer to steal the horses.
Si, I do the job for you, and you let me steal 20 horses.
To work for pay is humiliating.
Better to steal.
There's more emotion.
All right, all right.
Jeff, tell the men to let
Mr. Mezcal steal 20 horses...
Without shooting this time.
Muy bien.
Hombre, wine, now.
Let's drink to the 20 stallions.
When do we attack?
When they expect it least.
In a few days, send one of your men to look around and then report back to me.
I send Emiliano.
He would be able to crawl under your sombrero without you knowing it.
I figure there'll be about
20 of 'em, and every one a gunslinger.
So if you don't use your guns, they'll make fertilizer out of you.
Our faith prohibits violence.
You don't believe the four of us can hold off the Major's crowd, do you?
We'll have to ask the Lord for a temporary dispensation.
Better get it in a hurry, brother.
Brothers, we must make this decision now.
Yes.
There's no way out otherwise.
All right, but only for self-defense.
We will not kill.
Well, at least that's somethin'.
Okay, let's get going.
All right, line up now.
That's it.
If someone comes swinging with his right, what do you do?
You block with your left and counter with your right.
You.
I repeat-block with your left and counter with your right.
Got it?
Yes, brother.
All right, let's try it.
I said block with your left, not your right.
See what happens?
It's a question of timing.
If someone comes swinging a pole at you, what do you do?
I don't know.
Well, you duck.
Yeah.
Grab him.
Yeah.
And pull him down!
That clear?
Yes, brother.
Okay, ready?
Ready.
Ugh!
Oh, no.
Now, watch how it's done.
Watch.
Now, look at me.
Watch this.
You ready?
Ahh!
Remember, the most important thing is to be fast.
Is that clear?
Ahh!
Ahh!
Now, then, when you...
Experience is always the best teacher.
Now, if you ain't much at swinging your arms, you can always use your feet, like me.
Ow! Oh'
Ow!
Ready?
Mm-hmm.
All right, get up, and you try now.
Ahh!
Oh, Pete.
Easy, brother. Get up.
Up you go.
You get him in a lock and bounce him up and down like this.
Brother, perhaps you're going ahead too fast.
I have no time to waste.
Don't worry.
He'll be all right.
You know, I was just thinking.
If it's advice, save your breath.
It ain't advice.
I only want your opinion.
All right, go on.
Do you suppose there's somebody spying on us under that sombrero?
Then you duck.
Hmm.
It's a serious possibility.
That's what I thought.
Weasel!
When you swing around-...
Come here a minute.
Try it by yourselves.
All right, now, by the numbers.
Let's try it.
I think there's a spy sittin' under that sombrero up there on the hill.
Bring him down...
Alive.
Somethin' wrong, Sheriff?
Nothin' important.
There's only someone up there on the hill.
Weasel has gone to invite him down.
Heaven protect our friend.
Better protect the spy.
If you're smart, you'll talk.
Who sent ya?
Emiliano doesn't betray, gringo.
Emiliano tells everything.
I'm one of Mezcal's men.
The Major, he said he promised Mezcal 20 stallions if we chase the farmers out of here.
Listen, you ain't goin' ahead with that plan without me.
I know you too well.
You're like an open book.
Oh, yeah? Then let's see if you read right.
You wanna take the Mexicans' place, get the 20 horses, and then...
Am I wrong?
You read right.
I'm glad you're beginning to use your head.
Listen, Emiliano, would you do us a favor in exchange for your stinkin' skin?
Claro Que Si, hombre.
That's the spirit.
Hold it, right there!
No, no, don't shoot!
It's me, Emiliano!
Mezcal sent us to steal the horses.
All right, but make it quick.
Buenas noches, Señor.
Just take your 20 horses and clear outta here.
Si, Si.
I'll take the two white ones.
Two, three, four, five.
How did it go with the farmers?
Oh, fine.
Six.
Muy bien.
Seven, eight, nine, ten.
Any killings?
Eleven.
Todos muertos.
All dead?
Twelve, thirteen.
Right... children, women, old ladies, all dead.
Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.
Holy Hannah. Killed 'em all?
Seventeen.
Ah, Si.
Cats, dogs, everybody.
Eighteen, nineteen.
What a massacre!
Si, it was a nice massacre.
Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two...
Hey.
Twenty-three, twenty-four.
Hey, you were supposed to take 20.
Twenty-five, twenty-six.
Be quiet or I lose count, no?
Thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five.
Where is the sheriff?
Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm Jonathan Swift.
I keep the office in order, and the sheriff's gone out of town.
He is, huh?
When's he comin' back?
Well, that depends.
If he catches 'em, he should be back around, uh-—
Catches who?
Horse thieves.
Are these here the men?
Oh, the sheriff.
Yeah, there's a certain similarity.
There is?
That's them.
That's them.
That really is them.
Well, do you know where they were headed?
Listen, well, they told me they were going to the... border!
Yeah, remember the border-
Nail those there outside the office.
Yes, siree, right away, Sheriff.
If I ever catch up with them, they'll pay for this.
Yes, siree, went to the border.
We'll take care of the whole thing, Sheriff.
Don't you worry about-
Whiskey, whiskey.
Up you go.
You, too.
All the children are loaded into the wagon, Sheriff.
All right, over here!
Weasel, watch the kids.
Hear, men...
Take your boys and get around back of the house.
So, you wouldn't know where Tobias is.
I think he went down to the river with some of his men.
And the horses?
Huh?
The horses, damn you!
Where'd you put 'em?
Oh, the horses.
They're under cover, safe and sound.
Hey, brother lookout!
You seeing anything?
No, brother Sheriff, nothing!
I mean, yes!
They're coming!
They're coming!
Get ready.
Hah!
It's old Jonathan!
Whoa.
Whoa.
Major is looking for you, Sheriff.
What's he want?
Justice, I guess.
A herd of his horses was stolen, and he wants the help of the law to punish the rustlers and get his horses back.
Well, I can't help him now.
I didn't think so.
You're not keeping all those horses for yourself, are ya?
What horses?
What horses?
The Major's horses.
Did you come here to tell me that?
Yeah, among other things.
Such as?
Well, a man came to town today-...
Mustache, star on his chest, crutches, a typical crippled sheriff, and he was lookin' for the fellas who made him that way.
I sent him to the border.
Good.
Is that all?
Oh, no, no, no.
Uh, the Major will be here any minute.
Thanks, old man.
You're welcome.
I want my share.
Yeah, that figures.
What'd you bring him for?
Well, I couldn't leave him in town.
Uh, he's got a tendency to tell the truth.
He's an alcoholic, you know?
Ho!
Get these guns.
Put the Mexican in that wagon and keep him drunk.
Yes, siree, partner.
Hah!
Where the devil did Tobias go?
Tobias?
Yeah, Tobias.
Right there, boss.
I thought you ran out on us.
No, we were working, brother, working very hard.
That reminds me, boss.
Shouldn't we start diggin' a few graves now that we have the time?
A few graves?
You don't wanna turn this place into a cemetery, do you?
How do you think we're gonna hold off the Major?
With faith.
Hmm.
Faith is an impenetrable fortress.
As cynical as the Major maybe, he would not shoot at defenseless women and children.
He could be right.
What do you think?
Would you shoot at a bunch of women and kids?
Not the kids anyway.
Well, if you wouldn't do it, then the Major certainly isn't gonna do it.
Now, what's on your mind?
You're the one that does the thinking, and you came up with a good idea this time, too.
Hmm.
All right, but if the faith trick don't work, this fella is gonna be bright red.
They're coming!
They're coming!
He's playing his last card.
Move in!
Slowly!
Hah!
Hah!
Yah!
Yah!
Well, aren't you going to welcome me, old man?
Your silence won't keep me from destroying your dignified poverty.
Why waste time, Major?
Quiet.
There is work to be done.
Gentlemen, today will be a hard day for you, but you'll go home happy to have earned your money honestly for once.
Destroy everything they've built, beginning with that house, but please without yelling and making too much of an uproar.
You know I detest noise.
Burn their wagons and the tents and scatter those miserable cows.
Then we'll depart and let Mr. Mezcal take care of the rest.
Lost your tongue, old man?
You've lost your battle, Major, from the very moment you descended that hill.
The opinions of others, no matter how idiotic, should be respected.
I certainly will not be the one to violate the rules of good manners.
Jeff.
Jeff, tear the house down.
All right, boys, start hacking.
Je-Jeff!
Jeff!
Yeah, Major?
Come on back.
Hold it, boys!
Yeah.
There's been a variation in my plan.
Want us to start with the wagons and tents?
No, I don't think so.
Start driving out the cows?
Why should those animals bother you?
Well, I'm just not understanding.
What should I do?
Respect the principles of these people.
Put down your guns.
What?
Uh, do what I say.
Si, hombre!
This should make brother Tobias very happy.
He hates guns.
Excuse me, Major.
I don't know what your reason is for all this, but, uh, it better be good.
A very good motive, my friend.
Hey, look ahead!
Your plan worked like a miracle.
Well, Sheriff!
This-this really is very embarrassing.
Have you seen what faith can do?
It'll work, if you put it in a rifle barrel.
Well, I guess that's it.
For the moment, but this won't end here.
Oh, yeah?
No, Major, it ends here.
It's gotta end here.
"The words of Choheleth, son of David,
"King of Jerusalem."
Your hat, please.
"There's a time to be born and a time to die."
Yeah.
"To love and to hate.
"There is a time to-" brothers, it says here,
"there's a time to fight and a time to win!"
Win, brothers!
Go and fight!
Go on!
A one.
Two.
Three.
And a four.
Wait!
Come on.
Yeah, that's it.
You go up!
Up!
Pardon me, brother.
No, brother, let him go.
What are you doing?
And a two, and three, and a four.
I'm gonna bash ya and bash ya.
I'm gonna bash, and I'm gonna bash ya.
Ready, get set, go.
Two.
No!
Come on, brother!
Hit him hard!
A one, and a two, and a three, and a four.
I'm gonna bash ya, and I'm gonna bash ya.
A one, a two, and a three, and...
Here, brother.
Let-let me help you.
Let me-let me help you.
Thank you, brother.
Thanks, heH.
Load up the horses and let's get outta here.
Okay.
All right, the valley is yours, but give me back my horses.
What horses?
The ones you stole from me.
Hey, watch what you're sayin', Major.
You're horse thieves, and you know it.
One thing about that Major-—
He never lies.
Major, you ever been to Nebraska?
I heard there's some beautiful pastures there.
That, uh, idea about Nebraska doesn't sound too bad.
Hey, Major, Nebraska is that a-way.
Thank you, oh, Lo...
Forget it.
I was rendering thanks to the Lord, brother.
Oh.
The insidious hand of Satan has left this land.
Accept our humble thanks, oh, Father.
Hey, boss!
What's this mean?
Take a look.
What's that?
It's our brand, brother.
They're the tables of the Holy Law.
Naturally, you don't know nothin', huh?
Well, I thought, after all, it's only right that these people get paid back for damages, and so...
And so?
I'm not mad at you.
I'm mad at our ma.
She should've strangled you or at least drowned you when you were born.
Why, you no good crawlin' son of a lowdown-
Don't be angry, Sheriff.
It was the hand of destiny.
Wait!
Go to hell, you, with your destiny, your sisters, your brothers, your ancestors, your cows, and everything.
Oh.
This is just my luck.
Hah!
Let us pray.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, Lord, to your glory, we raise our chalice of love.
Take into your fold this lost sheep, who in penitence, has thrown his weapons of evil into the purifying flame of your forgiveness.
Circumcise the seeds of wrongdoing, which have blemished his soul.
Accept him back into the light of your spirit.
He shall labor 'til he grows weary with fatigue.
He shall irrigate these vast fields, seed and pick the fruits of his labor.
He will cut woods, build houses, and raise cattle.
And when each hard day's work is done, he shall return home with joy for so much fatigue.
Then, gathering his loved ones around him, he will give thanks to you, oh Lord, for guiding him through the travails of his life on earth.
We thank thee for the many blessings you have bestowed upon us and hope always to be worthy of your love.
Amen.
Amen.
Where is our new brother?
Come on, Bambino.
Why don't you want me to come with ya?
Get outta here, if you don't wanna get plugged in the back while you sleep.
But I'm your brother.
I'm beginning to doubt it.
Look, I'm headin' west for California, which means you're going east!
Huh!
Hah!
Hah!
You seen three varmints around these parts?
With faces like hangmen, you mean?
Are these the men?
Yeah, that's them, and they robbed me. They wanted to take my boots, too, but then they saw you and took off.
Which way did they go?
That a-way.
Hah!
Yah! Yah!
Californ-i-a.
Hi. Ed Ramsey from Delos.
If there's anyone who doesn't know what Delos is, well, as we've always said...
...Delos is the vacation of the future, today.
At Delos you get your choice of the vacation you want.
There's Medieval World, Roman World and, of course, Westworld.
Let's talk to some people who've been there.
Pardon me, sir. What is your name?
Gardner Lewis.
Just got back from Westworld.
Tell us how you liked it, Mr. Lewis.
When you played cowboys and Indians as a kid, you'd point...
...go "bang, bang" and the other kid would lie down and play dead.
Well, Westworld is the same thing, only... only it's for real!
I shot six people!
Well, they weren't real people!
What Mr. Lewis means is he shot six robots...
...scientifically programmed to look, act, talk and even bleed just like humans do.
Isn't that right?
Well, they may have been robots.
I mean, I think they were robots.
I mean, I know they were robots!
Yes, the robots of Westworld are there to serve you...
...and to give you the most unique vacation experience of your life.
Thank you, sir.
And you, madam?
Hello.
What is your name?
My name is Janet Lane, and I was in Roman World.
What is the one thing that stands out in your mind about Roman World?
Oh, well, I think it would be...
...the men!
I just feel marvelous! I mean...
...it's just a warm, glowing place to be!
Thank you very much.
Oh, thank you very much!
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
- And you, sir?
- Yeah?
What is your name, sir?
Oh, I'm Ted Mann.
I'm a stockbroker from St. Louis.
And, which world did you just come from, sir?
Oh, you're not going to believe this!
I've just been the sheriff of Westworld for the last two weeks!
Did it seem real to you, sir?
It's the realest thing I've ever done!
I mean that!
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.
And you, sir?
My name's Arthur Caine.
I've been in the castle.
I've had a couple of sword fights and three jousts.
And I...
I married a beautiful princess.
Is that something you've always dreamed of doing, sir?
All my life!
There were some of the comments of people who've just returned from Delos.
Why don't you arrange...
...to take our Hovercraft to Medieval World,
Roman World and Westworld?
Was it worth $1,000 a day?
Yes!
Contact us today, or see your travel agent.
Boy, have we got a vacation for you!
505. 345. 675. Delta 9.
505. 345. 675. Delta 9.
This is Delos Control to Station 3.
You are cleared on Vector 79, on 195...
We anticipate scanning in about four and a half minutes.
I'm not worried at all. I'm just...
I'm just curious.
How much do they weigh?
Three or four pounds.
That heavy.
Do they have much of a kick?
A Colt.45?
Well, I never fired one before.
What about that thing where you go like this over the gun?
- Fanning?
- Yeah.
- What about it?
- Is that hard to do?
Now...
The gunbelt, does it have those strings to tie around your leg?
If that's the kind you want.
That's the kind I want. I think it's probably better for quick draws, you know.
It all depends.
What kind of gunbelt did you have the last time?
I had the one without the strings.
And you could draw fast?
Then maybe it doesn't matter after all.
The guns they give you are real guns?
Real guns.
That's incredible.
Give us a shift to 197...
...and take it down to Port 43.
Negative acceleration at 22.
So long as you maintain passenger comfort.
Sigma-sigma was transferred according to the log at 041.
The orientation on the resort will now begin.
Please put on your earphones.
Don't you want to listen?
I heard it the last time.
...consists of three separate resort areas, each with its own special appeal.
Whichever resort you have chosen...
...we are sure you will have a fascinating and rewarding stay here.
Western World is a complete re-creation of the American frontier of 1880.
Here it is possible to relive the excitement and stresses of pioneer life to the fullest.
Western World is a life of lawless violence, a society of guns and action.
This is Medieval World, where we have reconstructed 13th-century Europe.
A world of chivalry and combat, romance and excitement.
Our teams of engineers have spared no expense in this re-creation...
...precise to the smallest detail.
Then we have Roman World:
A lusty treat for the senses in the setting of delightful, decadent Pompeii.
Here the traveler experiences the sensual, relaxed morality that existed at the peak...
...of the Imperial Roman Empire.
All together, these resorts comprise Delos...
...the most exciting vacation spot in the history of man.
This is Delos Control to Station 3.
Your negative deceleration should be 25...
...and your ground speed should be
355 and dropping.
The whole spectrum of technology has been employed in Delos...
...for the vacationer's pleasure.
Expensive and unusual,
Delos is not for everyone.
But for those who choose it, it is truly a unique and rewarding experience.
We have you on Grid 5.
Notify ground crews.
Stand by. Locking in now.
Shut down 2, shut down 3.
Shut down 2, shut down 3.
Nice job, everybody.
Welcome to Delos.
Please go to your color-coded tram...
...which will take you to the world of your choice.
Give your name to the attendant.
Welcome to Delos.
Please go to your color-coded tram...
...which will take you to the world of your choice.
May I have your name, please?
John Blane.
- Peter Martin.
- Thank you.
Please go to your color-coded tram which will take you...
...to the world of your choice.
We are sure you will enjoy your stay in Western World.
Was she a...?
Probably.
That's amazing!
Supposedly, you really can't tell... except by looking at the hands.
They haven't perfected the hands yet.
Nothing can go wrong.
You will enjoy your stay in Roman World.
While you are there, please feel free to indulge your every whim.
Medieval World exists for you, the guest.
Nothing can go wrong.
I have a quick fade on the CRT and my balance controls don't seem to help me.
I'm keeping this in real time.
Switch me over to an on-line status and I'll do it manually.
You've got a three-millisecond cycle delay which should be computed in.
I don't know what to do if the stagecoach is late.
Oh! It's fantastic!
I reckon that's everything.
Bath's down the hall.
Bath'll cost you two bits for hot water.
Dinner at 7:00, breakfast at 6:30.
Get lunch on your own.
Couple of places in town to eat.
Don't look like much here, but we have everything.
Just a minute.
You mean to tell me he's a robot?
That's what I mean to tell you.
We're paying $1,000 a day for this?
It's authentic.
The West of the 1880s.
Well, at least they could've made it a little more comfortable.
But that's the point.
This is really the way it was.
If you wanted comfort, you should have stayed in Chicago.
Julie would have loved all this!
Poking around for hours in all those funny shops, looking for silly...
What the hell is wrong with you?
You're a lawyer!
You know better than anybody else what a ride she took you for.
Well, the kids...
Fine, the kids!
But you're here, six months later, still thinking about her.
No, not really.
She just came to mind, is all.
There's a lot to do here.
- What'll it be?
- Whiskey.
What about you?
Vodka martini on the rocks with a twist of lemon. Very dry, please.
Just give him whiskey.
He's new in town.
You've got to get into the feel of the thing.
I feel silly.
Why?
It's like a joke.
It's not a joke, it's an amusement park.
It's the best amusement park in the world.
All you have to do is have fun.
There's some pretty rough-looking customers here.
How many of them are...?
Guests like us?
Who knows?
That's the beauty of this place.
It doesn't matter.
It may look rough, but it's still just a resort.
There's no way to get hurt here.
Just enjoy yourself.
What is this stuff?
It doesn't say.
God! Give me this!
Puts hair on your chest.
Yeah.
Sloppy with your drink.
Get this boy a bib.
Go on!
He needs his momma.
Kill him.
You talk too much.
You say something, boy?
I said, you talk too much.
Why don't you make me shut up?
Your move.
Pretty realistic, huh?
Listen, are you sure he was a...?
Of course. You don't really think you shot anybody, do you?
Wow!
Hey, John...
How do I know I'm not going to kill another guest with this thing?
Try it.
Shoot me.
Go on, shoot.
Shoot!
The gun has a sensing device.
It won't fire at anything with a high body temperature.
Only something cold, like a machine.
They thought of everything.
The Black Knight won't be repaired till tomorrow afternoon.
Yeah, I have the banquet scheduled for 5:30, if that conforms.
What do folks do for companionly entertainment in this town?
I wouldn't know about such things.
I'm just runnin' this hotel.
Miss Carrie has a real nice saloon down at the end of the street.
Now, I won't have talk of that woman in this house.
Not over my dinner.
The food's real good, ma'am.
Thank you, stranger.
You're a gentleman of some breedin'.
Isn't she terrific?
Who's Miss Carrie?
You fellas new in town?
Yep.
Whiskey.
Just passin' through?
Maybe.
Lookin' for some fun?
Maybe.
Well, you've come to the right place.
There's plenty of fun here.
That's Cindy and Arlette.
Arlette's from Paris.
Perhaps you gentlemen are taking a likin' to 'em.
Perhaps.
They're real accommodatin'.
- They look it.
- Listen...
Why don't you just go on upstairs and we'll reckon accounts later?
- Sounds good to me.
- Are those two girls machines?
Now, how can you say a thing like that?
Come on.
What's goin' on?
They're robbin' the bank.
Robbin' the bank?
Hey, maybe we oughta go help out.
You don't know.
It might be fun to play bank robbers.
Look, Pete, this is better.
There...
There is something I have to tell you.
I don't know if it matters...
...but it matters to me.
I haven't ever had a...
Well, I hardly know you, if you know what I mean. I mean...
We just met a few minutes ago.
You're probably very nice.
I feel funny.
Why?
I think you're very nice.
How was it? Wasn't it terrific?
Boy, machines are the servant of man!
Wasn't that great?
Not bad.
Not bad. Now you're the big lover!
Well, you know how it is.
Some guys have a way with women.
Shooting stopped.
I guess we missed the robbery.
You can't have everything.
John...
...this place is really fun!
I think it's the jugular unit.
- What do you think?
- Should we try and rewire her?
No, I'd replace the whole unit rather than try and repair it.
With a 10?
Use an XX-50 if we have any in stock.
The double X's have a longer lifespan.
A 50 may not fit in here.
Maybe you can shift the integrator unit further up into the cavity.
I'll try it.
Balance servo again?
Yeah, she fell over this afternoon.
I think it's the sensor.
If it's the central unit we'll open her up.
You get a confirmation before you do that.
What's he in for?
Central malfunction.
Another one?
Since we opened the resort, we had a failure and breakdown rate...
...conforming to computer predictions.
That is 0.3 malfunctions for each 24-hour activation period...
...concurrent or not.
Now, this was an anticipated operations aspect of the resort...
...and we were fully able to handle it.
The majority of the breakdowns were minor or peripheral...
...until about six weeks ago.
Then Roman World had a rise in breakdown rate...
...which doubled in a week.
In addition, we saw a disproportionate rise...
...in central as opposed to peripheral breakdowns.
Now, we identified some problems with humidity control...
...and regained homeostasis.
Despite our corrections, the breakdown rate continued to climb.
Then Medieval World began to have trouble.
Now we're seeing more Western World breakdowns.
And there's a clear pattern here which suggests an analogy...
...to an infectious disease process spreading from one resort area to the next.
Perhaps there are superficial similarities to disease.
It's only a theoretical concept.
There are many ways to order that data.
I must confess,
I find it difficult to believe in...
...a disease of machinery.
We aren't dealing with ordinary machines here.
These are highly complicated pieces of equipment...
...almost as complicated as living organisms.
In some cases, they've been designed by other computers.
We don't know exactly how they work.
Okay, up gain 437...
I'm not getting sound pickup from the tenth quadrant.
Okay, my telemetry is good.
Repeat, I have good telemetry.
We have sunrise at 0.43.
Ready on all quadrants.
Energize grid.
Grid energized.
All right, then give me a 436, if you can patch that in.
If not, 435.
I have sound now. Thank you very much.
Yes, I want scrambled eggs and bacon and cinnamon toast.
Do you have cinnamon toast? You do?
Okay, send it down to Central Control Room, Console 3.
Wait a minute.
What was that? No grounding on Unit 5?
Try a bypass.
I have readings on all units, 5 included.
Hold on a minute.
All right, let's stand by for resort activation.
You ready on Phase 443?
Okay, we're going to activate at 59...
Lower gain Alpha 2...
Ready on six, on five, on four...
...on three, on two. Activate now.
"Oh, give me a home
"Where the buffalo roam
"And the deer and the antelope play
"Where seldom is heard
"A discouraging word
"And the skies are not cloudy all day"
What do you want?
"Home, home on the range"
Not one word.
Do you mind if I finish shaving?
Have you no sense of...
Was he bothering you?
He isn't gonna bother you again.
I'm here to tell you that things have changed.
There's law here now.
You can't go around plugging whoever you please.
But, Sheriff, it was self-defense.
That's what they all say.
He shot a man.
He'll have to stand trial.
Judge'll be here next week.
If I were you,
I wouldn't trouble over your friend here.
Judge Benson likes to hang 'em.
Hang 'em high.
Look, Sheriff...
Beat it.
I said, beat it!
I've never been in jail before.
First time for everything.
But I haven't done anything wrong.
You shot a man. That's something.
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.
Well, Chicago's a long way from here, fella.
A thousand miles and more.
Hold it!
I guess that sort of makes us desperados.
Yeah, I guess.
Well, what do we do now?
The way I figure it, anything we want.
- There's no law in that town now.
- I'll say.
We go in there, and we do anything we want!
You know what?
What?
I almost believe all this.
Why shouldn't you believe it?
It's as real as anything else.
Yep.
I reckon.
What can you give me in Grid 7?
We have that on SM-514.
Transfer, now.
Transferred.
Reschedule.
She wants to meet the king.
We have to restructure for that.
Can't disappoint a guest.
Yeah, listen, this is the third day in a row that I've called you about my laundry.
You've got all my shirts...
We're rechecking the tapes on the mechanism now.
We have programmed infidelity in the queen...
...as of two minutes ago.
All right, coming up on the castle, zero...
Now.
It also conforms with your five-year history at this time of the year.
Leave me now.
My queen!
If the king should hear of this, we would both be put to death!
I would be more than happy to die for you, my lady.
Let us pray it shall not be so.
I have news.
The Black Knight has returned, and seeks a match with you.
The Black Knight...?
None other.
Is he pretty tough?
He has the strength of ten, and cunning besides.
But...
...his sight is weak in his left eye.
Stay to his left and you will prevail and win the day.
Confirmation of the reprogramming of that Black Knight...
...for left lateral weakness and instability for tomorrow.
I shall see you on the morrow?
My lady.
Schedule for tomorrow a.m.
It's his last day in the resort.
Let's make it a lulu.
Tomorrow a.m. Broadswords.
Schedule locked.
We have a problem with the air conditioning in Beta section.
Send a crew out.
Yes! He can be sheriff any time he wants.
That is correct.
Just give him the badge.
Now, I'm the new law around here.
You think you can handle things?
You wanna try me?
A thousand pardons, my lord.
What is your name, child?
Daphne.
Daphne.
Oh, I love this place.
I love my horse.
I love my horse and I love Julie.
Oh, shut up, will you?
I like the spots on my horse.
- Did you see the spots on my horse?
- Your horse is beautiful.
- Thank you very much. I like yours, too.
- Thank you.
Look out!
Let me handle this!
Goddamn it!
- Do you suppose it's real?
- Hell, no!
That's not supposed to happen!
Maybe it is!
Maybe it's part of the thing!
The hell! Goddamn machines, anyway!
That's not supposed to happen!
A rattlesnake struck a guest?
He was shooting at it and he missed.
The snakes are programmed never to hit on a strike.
- Was the guest injured?
- Minor puncture wounds.
It's inexcusable to injure a guest.
Pick up that snake for a total post at once.
Check all the snake's central mechanisms tonight during the repair period.
Doesn't anything work around here?
Logic circuits on the snake simply failed to respond.
There was no sign of mechanical damage or tampering...
...and no clue to the malfunction.
Central mechanism psychosis?
I feel we should shut down the resort for a month.
Oh, that seems rash.
A snake injured a guest.
We can't allow that to happen.
Many elements of the Delos Resort are potentially dangerous.
That's part of the appeal.
But if they become truly dangerous...
I agree.
We can announce that the resort is overbooked...
...and not allow any further new guests to arrive.
We can take care of the ones already here.
If we can't insure the safety of the guests, we'll be in desperate trouble.
But we can insure their safety.
Everything's fine.
All right, let's start that bar fight.
Cheat!
John, what do you say?
Hit me.
Now, that's just rude!
Hey, Sheriff! Come on!
What's his problem?
Nothing. He got shot up today, so we're taking the opportunity...
...to replace the visual cortex.
Using the new infrared units.
And we're increasing audio sensitivity.
You called for me, my lord?
Yes.
How long have you been in the palace, Daphne?
Since I was three, my lord.
Charming.
I think we ought to get to know each other better, Daphne.
Better, my lord?
I can reward you well.
My lord...
Daphne...
My lord!
Daphne...
My lord forgets himself!
Problem with the girl.
Program breakdown.
What's the trouble?
One of the castle machines isn't responding.
Refusing a guest seduction.
Get her out of there, and report it to central repair.
Right.
Refusing...?
- Did you find the trouble?
- No apparent trouble.
But she wasn't following programming.
She refused a guest seduction and she is a sex model.
Certainly is.
Will they shut down?
No, the directors feel that to close down now would hurt tourist confidence.
I don't like it.
Breakfast.
I'm never gonna drink again.
Okay, 437...
I'm not getting sound pickup in the tenth quadrant.
Please set numbers to console...
Hold, varlet!
Are you speaking to me?
None other, sire.
Look, I'm hungry and I...
Prepare for thy doom, thy scurrilous knave! Huh!
Wait a minute! Can't we talk this over?
What, have you no spine, varlet?
Well, I...
The queen!
Full monitor.
Okay.
Let him go.
Oh, what a hangover.
All right, varlet!
We're losing a little tolerance.
Bring me up.
Shut down! Shut down immediately!
Circuits don't respond, sir!
Then cut the robot power!
Power cut!
Oh, my head!
I'm freezing!
Gotta get to the hotel.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
- They're not responding!
- Shall we cut the main power grid, sir?
Shut it all down! Shut it all down!
Hold it!
Come on, not now.
Not you again.
It's too early.
Let me do it this time.
Your move.
I'm shot.
What?
I'm shot!
John...?
Oh, my God!
Draw.
Sir, we have no control over the robots at all!
- They're running on stored charge!
- How long can they go?
Some will begin to run down in an hour.
Others can go a full 12!
- Turn the main grid back on!
- The relays must be frozen.
We can't get back our power!
Hello? Hello?
Now, how are we going to get out of here?
All these doors are electrically powered.
Now, get these doors open in here before we all suffocate!
Temperature elevated, 98 degrees.
Oxygen, 17 percent and dropping.
Get that power on so we can open these doors.
Hey!
Don't shoot me!
Hey, wait a minute!
What's the matter with you?
Hold out your hands.
Let me see your hands!
You're a guest!
You really gave me a scare.
Look, everything's broken down.
The machines have gone crazy.
You know about the machines?
Yeah, I repair 'em.
There's one chasing me now.
A gunslinger.
Gunslinger.
Must be a model 404, maybe a 406.
If he's a 406, he's got all the sensory equipment.
It's a beautiful machine!
He's after me!
I don't doubt it.
What can I do?
There's nothing you can do.
He'll get you.
You haven't got a chance.
There must be something!
Fella, don't kid yourself.
There are things you could try:
Acid for his visual system, noise for his hearing...
No matter what, he'll always be one jump ahead of you!
You haven't got a chance!
Yes, I do.
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
All right. It's all right.
- It's okay.
- Help me!
All right, all right.
- Help me!
- You're gonna be all right.
Help me!
No water...
- Go ahead. Go ahead and drink.
- No water...
- I'm trying to help you.
- No water. No. No!
Why don't you make arrangements to take our Hovercraft...
...to Medieval World, Roman World and Westworld.
Contact us today, or see your travel agent.
Boy, have we got a vacation for you, vacation for you...
...for you, for you, for you...
His name was J.B. Books,
and he had a matched pair of. 45s
with antique ivory grips
that were something to behold...
but he wasn't an outlaw.
Fact is, for a while,
he was a lawman.
Long before I met Mr. Books, he was a famous man.
I guess his fame was why somebody or other
was always after him.
The wild country had taught him to survive.
Hyah!
He lived his life and herded by himself.
He had a credo that went...
I won't be wronged. I won't be insulted.
I won't be laid a hand on.
I don't do these things to other people.
I require the same from them.
You hold it right there.
Give me your wallet.
Take it a little easy with that cannon, mister.
Just throw me your wallet.
Yes, sir, and a little something extra.
You done murdered me.
No, but you're going to have a long winter bellyache, you boob.
Give me that wallet.
Just the wallet.
I can hardly move.
You done shot a hole in my stomach.
I appreciate that.
You ain't going to leave me here.
Well, it's quite obvious that's what you were going to do to me.
Get out of the way.
Mister, you better find yourself another line of work.
This one sure don't fit your pistol.
Hey, mister, want a paper?
Yeah, I will, son.
Queen Victoria's dead.
There you are.
Thank you.
Whoa.
Hey!
Hey, you!
Hey, Methuselah, move that cack out of the way.
Are you talking to me?
Yeah, you dumb bastard.
Move it, or I'll deliver you something to remember me by.
Well, now, pardon me all to hell.
Giddyup!
Buster.
Whoa.
Try it.
Come on, Jay, the old man ain't worth the bullet.
He looks all tuckered out.
Giddyup.
You're right there, son.
Doc Hostetler.
John Bernard Books.
You remembered.
The newspapers occasionally remind me.
Wh-What was it,
15 years ago?
The only time
I was ever hit...
Right here at the Acme Saloon.
You killed two men.
I'm damn lucky you were around.
That second one nearly did me in, coming out of nowhere like that.
You must have the constitution of an ox.
Well, we'll see.
That's what
I'm here for.
Oh?
About 10 days ago in Creede, Colorado,
I hadn't been feeling up to snuff, so I went to see a sawbones there.
He, uh...
Well, the next day
I got on my horse and took off to find you.
And what did my colleague in Creede say?
Examine me, and I'll tell you.
You don't trust me.
Oh, Doc, you saved my life.
You don't trust my profession.
In my profession, you trust too much, you don't celebrate many birthdays.
I kind of like it around here.
All right,
I'll examine you.
Take your clothes off down to your long johns.
Now, I, uh... if I'm to know what to look for, you'll have to tell me what's ailing you.
Well, I hurt, Doc, way down deep in my back.
Not all the time, but now and then suddenly.
Pain in the lumbar vertebrae?
Like sin.
All right, whenever you get ready, just... bend over the table there, trapdoor down.
Well?
Books, every few days
I have to tell a man or a woman something
I don't want to.
I've been practicing medicine for 29 years, and I still don't know how to do it well.
Why don't you just say it flat out?
All right.
You have a cancer... advanced.
Is that what that fella up at Creede told you?
Yeah.
And you didn't believe him.
No.
Do you believe me?
Can't you cut it out, Doc?
I'd have to gut you like a fish.
Well, what can you do?
There's... just, uh... very little
I can do.
Uh, if... when the pain gets too bad,
I can give you something.
What you're trying to tell me is that I...
Yeah.
Damn.
I'm sorry, Books.
You told me I was strong as an ox.
Well, even an ox dies.
How much time do I have?
Two months... six weeks... less.
There's no way to tell.
Well, what can I...
What will I be able to do?
Oh, anything you want at first.
Then, later on, you won't want to.
How much later?
You'll know when.
You'll have to get off your feet and get some rest.
Have you made any kind of arrangements for a room?
No. I just got in town.
You might try the widow Rogers.
She's got a place down the street a fair piece.
She takes in lodgers.
She's a nice woman.
She needs the help.
I'll give it a try.
Do me a favor.
Don't tell anybody
I'm in town.
Oh, no, but if I wanted to go unnoticed,
I don't think I'd walk around with this thing.
Stole it from a whorehouse in Creede.
Did you?
Hello.
This the Rogers place?
Yeah.
Ma!
You can tell your mother that a tuckered-out old man needs a room.
Good afternoon, sir.
Afternoon.
Doc Hostetler says you might be able to help me.
How kind of him.
Yes, sir, I have one room available.
Good.
Downstairs in the rear.
$8.00 by the week.
$2.00 per day if you're not permanent.
Well, I'm not permanent, ma'am.
Oh, boy, get my gear and the saddlebags off that horse and bring them into the house.
Gillom will be happy to do that.
The parlor is yours to use and the telephone.
My other lodgers have rooms upstairs.
Two railroad men and a schoolteacher.
I'll introduce them at supper.
My kitchen.
And the bathroom.
I thought that's what it was.
We do have running water, also in the washbowl in here.
Nice-looking brass bed.
I hope it hasn't got any, uh...
It isn't ticky, is it?
It certainly is not.
This is very comfortable.
I'll take my meals right here.
I serve in the dining room.
I'll pay you extra.
Very well, since you're not permanent.
This suit's got a lot of countryside on it.
I'd like to have it brushed before morning.
I'll take those saddlebags.
That bedroll you can leave outside.
I have my things wrapped in it.
They'll need soap and water.
Have you a barn?
No, we don't.
Boy, take my horse over...
My name's Gillom.
It's not "boy. "
It's Gillom Rogers, and I don't like being ordered around.
Well, that's fair enough,
Gillom Rogers.
Would you be so kind as to take Old Dollar over to the livery stable and see that he gets a double order of oats?
O.K.
You seem to be a man accustomed to giving orders.
I guess it is a bad habit of mine.
I didn't get your name.
I didn't give it.
Is it so important?
For anyone living under my roof, it is.
Well, all right.
It's, uh... Hickok,
William Hickok.
Where do you hail from,
Mr. Hickok?
Abilene, Kansas.
And what do you do there?
I'm a U.S. Marshal.
Oh, that's nice.
No, it isn't.
I'm glad you're not staying long, Mr. Hickok.
I'm not sure
I like you.
Not many do,
Mrs. Rogers.
Moses, where did you hide the whiskey this time?
Third drawer from the left, Gilly boy.
Gilly, fetch me my spectacles.
What the hell are you doing?
You watch your language, boy.
J.B. Books is in my house.
Hey.
My name is Books.
Y'all get that?
Bang!
Boom!
He's in my house.
Ma!
Ma, I got to tell you something.
Shh. Close the door.
What's happened?
Who do you think...
Oh, Gillom, you've been drinking again.
Do you know who he is?
William Hickok...
United States Marshal in Abilene, Kansas.
Ma,
Wild Bill Hickok was shot before I was born.
We got
J.B. Books here.
He's killed 30 men.
Gillom, go to your room.
Go on. Go to bed before you wake the house.
Good night, Ma.
Whoo.
Come in.
Mr. Books?
Oh, my clothes.
Thank you, m...
You are J.B. Books.
That's right.
May I ask how you found out?
My son.
I've been up all night because of you.
I demand that you pack and leave.
That is not possible.
And why not?
I don't propose to say.
So you won't go.
No.
And that's your last word?
Mrs. Rogers, you have a fine color when you're on the scrap.
Central, give me the city marshal's office.
Thank you.
Come in, Marshal.
My name's Thibido,
Marshal
Walter Thibido.
I'm told... you are J.B. Books.
You were told right.
Have a seat.
Don't think I will.
Breathe easy, Marshal.
You're closer to your gun than I am to mine.
Books, Carson City's full of hard cases...
Is your head cold?
Huh?
Oh.
Books, Carson City's full of hard cases who'd sell their souls to put your name on the wall.
You'll draw trouble like an outhouse draws flies.
I checked my bulletins before I come over and didn't find nothing
I can hold you for, but I want you out of town... directly, today.
Maybe I'm not so inclined.
Then, by God,
I will incline you.
I can badge as many men as I need.
We'll smoke you out or carry you out feet first, so you say which,
Mr. Gunman.
It's your funeral.
Soon, yes.
Huh?
I can't go.
Can't?
I'm going to die right here in this room.
Ha! That's too thin.
I wish you were right.
Would you believe
Doc Hostetler?
That's his verdict.
You don't say?
You don't sa... goddamn!
Whoo!
Whooee!
I tell you the truth...
Coming through that door,
I was scared.
I know what a man like you is capable of.
I wondered who'd get my job, if the council would give my wife a pension, and if it would snow the day they put me under.
Excuse me if I don't pull a long face.
You talk too much.
Much as I damn please.
How long does
Hostetler give you?
He doesn't know.
Do me a favor.
I owe you one... or Hostetler.
My being here... maybe that's news, but dying is my own business.
Keep it under your hat, will you?
Just don't take too long to die.
Be a gent and convenience everybody and do it soon.
You've worn out your welcome.
Scat.
The day they lay you away, what I'll do on your grave won't pass for flowers.
You damn little sneak.
How long were you there?
I was just passing by.
You spy on me, and I'll nail you to a tree.
You've told your mother.
Who else have you blabbed to?
Jay Cobb.
Are you all right,
Mr. Books?
I can't abide a skulker.
You want to see me, knock on my door like a man.
Sure you're all right?
If there's anything
I can do for you, just let me know.
It's an honor to have you in this house.
Your mother doesn't agree.
She doesn't know how a man feels.
You're the most famous person ever in this town.
When I was a boy,
I heard about your shootout at the Acme Saloon.
I never thought
I'd meet you.
There's more to being a man than handling a gun.
Don't you have something to do?
I was just headed over to
Cobb's Creamery right now.
I help Jay with deliveries sometimes.
That was the nice gentleman you were with yesterday.
Where's your mother?
She's in the kitchen,
I think.
Well, goodbye, sir.
It was real nice meeting you.
Good-bye.
Mrs. Rogers, I, uh... hope you'll forgive me for taking Hickok's name.
I thought it was pretty funny at the time, but after reflection... it wasn't such a joke, and I apologize.
You should.
The only way you can show your repentance is to leave.
Well, that
I cannot do.
Mr. Books, you are a notorious individual utterly lacking in character or decency.
You're an assassin.
That's according to which end of the gun you're on.
You lied to me, made a fool of me.
This house is all I have.
If my lodgers find out who you are, they'll leave.
I have a cancer.
I'm dying of it.
I know what you'll be thinking...
That I'll be a lot of trouble.
Well, I won't.
You just bring me my meals, and I'll see to the other needs.
I promise you
I won't be a burden.
Mrs. Rogers, I'm in a kind of a tight...
I'll make it worth your while.
I can pay $4.00 a day for the room.
Oh, Mr. Books.
Most pleased to meet you, sir, and honored.
What did you want to see me about?
The name is Dan Dobkins.
I'm with
The Morning Appeal.
Mr. Dobkins, sit down.
Thank you.
Um... we ran the story this morning that you were here at Mrs. Rogers' and enjoying our salubrious winter climate and so on and so forth.
Have you seen it?
No.
It's page one,
I assure you.
I bought your paper when I arrived.
Still reading about
Queen Victoria dying.
Oh.
What can I do for you?
That's what
I came to discuss.
Well, that's what I figured.
You must appreciate, sir, that you are the most celebrated shootist extant.
Extant?
Uh, still existing, alive.
Thank you.
Yes, and your reputation is nationwide.
My story went out over the wires this morning.
Every daily of consequence will run it, but they'll want more, the papers in the East, in particular.
Between us, Mr. Books, we can really put
Carson City on the map.
Mr. Dobkins, you're going the long way around the barn.
Yes, sir.
I would like tremendously to do a series of stories on you.
A series?
Yes. Uh, how long will you be with us?
Not as long as I'd like to be.
Oh, well, we could start today, right now, then get together again tomorrow.
You see, there's been so much cheap fiction about gunmen.
I want to get down to the true story for once, while you're available, before anything happens to you.
I mean,
I hope nothing does.
Go on.
I want to cover your career factually.
The statistics, you might say.
Then I'd delve into the psychological aspects...
What turned you to violence in the first place?
Are you by nature bloodthirsty?
Uh, do you, uh, brood after the deed is done, or have you lived so long with death that you're used to it?
The death of others?
The prospect of your own?
Make like that's a nipple.
One fit or fidget and Mrs. Rogers is going to be scrubbing your brains off the wallpaper.
On your feet.
Back up.
Now, we're heading for the front door.
Now, don't you shake, shiver, or sneeze.
Mr. Books, what in heaven's name are you doing?
Ma'am, we have a touchy situation here.
Out.
Turn around.
Mmm.
Turn around.
Bend over.
Yes, sir.
Dobkins, you are a prying, pipsqueaking ass, and if you ever come dandying around here again...
That was a savage thing to do.
Maybe...
Mr. Books?
I'll tend myself.
First things first, Doc.
I almost forgot to ask you.
How much do I owe you?
You're a man after my own heart, Books.
Most of them ask that last, if at all.
Well, let's see.
We'll make it $4.00 for the two visits plus $ 1.00 for that.
What's that?
They call that laudanum, a solution of opium and alcohol.
Opium, that can get to be a habit.
Why, absolutely, an addiction.
How does it taste?
Just... just awful, terrible, but it's the most potent painkiller we've got.
How much of it do I take?
Well, as much as you need when you need it.
I think a spoonful would be all right to start with.
Later?
I don't know, but I... I think one morning you're just going to wake up and say,
"Here I am in this bed, and here I'm going to stay. "
Hostetler,
I want to know.
Well, unless you insist,
I'd rather not talk about it.
Well, I want to know.
All right.
There'll be an increase in the severity of the pain in your lower spine, your hips, your groin.
You...
Do you... Do you want me to go on?
The pain will become unbearable.
Uh, no drug will moderate it.
If you're lucky, you'll lose consciousness, and until then, you'll scream.
L- I... I'm sorry.
L... I didn't mean to be specific like this.
The next time,
I'll go to Mrs. Rogers.
You... You...
You just telephone.
You just telephone.
There... There's one more thing I'd say.
Both of us have had a lot to do with death.
I'm not a brave man, but you must be.
Ah.
Now-now-now, this is not advice.
It's not even a suggestion.
It's just something for you to reflect on while your mind's still clear.
What?
I would not die a death like I just described.
No?
Not if I had your courage.
Oh.
Thanks.
Come in, Mrs. Rogers.
Oh, Mr. Books, I...
I'm beginning to know your knock.
I was reading about old Queen Vic.
Well, maybe she outlived her time.
Maybe she was a museum piece, but she never lost her dignity nor sold her guns.
She hung on to her pride and went out in style.
That's the kind of an old gal I'd like to meet.
Mrs. Rogers, are you afraid of me?
Well, to be frank, yes.
Why?
All these guns and the kind of man you are.
Maybe you're afraid of too many things.
Sometimes widows are, but I'm sure there's plenty of starch in your corset.
Mr. Books, I came here to see what you can eat, if you can have what I'm serving.
No, you didn't.
I wish you'd stop contradicting me.
I wish you'd say what you mean.
Very well.
I apologize for the unchristian things
I've said and done.
I'm sorry, and I'll do whatever I can for you.
Well, thank you. I...
All my life,
I've been too proud to take help from anyone.
Guess I'll have to learn.
Would you, uh... sit down for a moment?
Please do.
What's that?
Laudanum.
Doc Hostetler's remedy.
That's habit-forming, isn't it?
Mrs. Rogers, would you go for a drive in the country with me tomorrow?
Oh, I... I couldn't, but thank you.
I wish you'd reconsider.
It would only be for an hour or two.
No. I appreciate the invitation, but no.
Is it that you don't want to be alone with me?
It's not that,
I assure you.
It's just that I've only been a widow for a year.
People would...
People!
If I have to work on your sympathy, I will.
I want to go out in the world again and see trees, lakes, hills, and the sky.
And I don't fancy seeing it alone.
I've been full of alone lately.
I'm sorry.
Besides, there's a threat of snow in the air.
Since I moved in here, we've been scratching at each other and apologizing.
Well, let's see if we can't do better.
Damn it. I wish to hell you'd ride with me.
I apologize for my language.
I'll go with you.
Good.
Tomorrow at 10:00?
Will you get, please,
Mr. Gillom Rogers to trot down to the stable and get us the best horse and buggy they have?
I will.
I'm much obliged, ma'am.
Good evening.
Deuce is the dead card.
8 is your winner, and the lovely queen, the loser.
Hellfire!
That makes seven turnovers in a row.
Pulford,J.B. Books over at Mrs. Rogers.
That was yesterday's news.
But I just heard he's dying.
Dying?
Friend of mine got it from Marshal Thibido.
Old Books is cashing in.
That's hard news.
That's a man
I could have taken.
Ha!
My ass.
You have two ways of leaving this establishment, my friend...
Immediately or dead.
Gentlemen, place your bets.
Place your bets, gentlemen.
Look out!
Clean through the heart!
Hey, Pulford!
Over 80 feet!
- Hooray!
- Hooray!
Oh, mighty handsome, ma'am.
Moses had to dust this buggy off.
He says he don't rent it too often.
Doesn't.
Except just for funerals.
Well, thank you, Gillom.
I appreciate this.
I want that wood chopped by the time we get back.
Oh, Ma, I was going to go on...
Yes, ma'am.
Hyah.
That is beauty.
It is a little chilly up here.
Would you like the top raised?
No, thank you.
You all right?
I will be in a minute.
Can I help you?
I've had plenty of practice.
Why don't you get married again?
What?
I think you heard me.
That's none of your affair.
I haven't time to be polite, Mrs. Rogers.
Well, for one thing,
I haven't been asked.
For another,
I loved my husband and still do.
How did he die?
Stroke, they think.
They found him slumped at his desk.
He was lucky.
He was 41.
Did he have time to, uh...
Did he leave you any security?
I have the property and the house, which he built with a bank loan, and Gillom.
And he worries you.
Yeah, he certainly does, particularly when he complains about being bored and needing excitement.
Well, I wouldn't be too hard on him.
Every young man feels the need to let the badger loose now and again.
I try to reason with him. I can't.
I can only mother him.
That's not what he wants.
Like I said, that you can change.
Don't you have enough worries of your own?
A few, but in general,
I've had a hell of a good time.
Tell me, um... what does the J.B.
Stand for?
John Bernard.
And yours?
Bond.
That's a crackerjack of a name for a woman.
How do you do, Bond?
How do you do,
John Bernard?
Shall we?
Hyah!
Good morning,
Mrs. Rogers!
Mr. Sweeney.
Mike Sweeney?
John Bernard Books, now, I'm flattered that you remembered me.
You live around here now?
My spread's in the foothills to the west.
Well, you look just like
I remember the Sweeneys... mean and ugly.
Well, I heard that you were in town for a very short time.
That's true.
Drop by.
We'll talk about old times.
The good old times.
Ha ha ha!
You can bring your fancy pillow, and your landlady is welcome, too.
Now, my problem is that she never accepts my invitation, and to you two,
I say good-bye.
I'm surprised at the company you keep.
That man is no friend.
Quite the reverse.
How do you know him?
I don't.
I had some dealings with his brother Albert once.
What happened?
Oh.
That's what worries me,
John Bernard... the thought of your victims.
What worried me was survival.
Bond, I don't believe
I ever killed a man that didn't deserve it.
Surely, only the Lord can judge that.
Mr. Books!
Mr. Books?
Sir?
Are you hurt?
No.
But they are.
Call the marshal.
He got both of them.
They came in through the windows... guns blazing.
Close your robe.
He's so damn fast, he killed them both.
John Bernard Books in a shootout right here.
Son of a bitch!
I will not have that language in my house.
Sorry, but this is a great day.
Our house is a part of history.
You've got to know that.
That's nothing to be proud of.
I love that old man.
Gillom! All right!
It's time you knew.
He's dying.
Who?
Mr. Books.
I don't believe it.
He has a cancer.
You're lying.
He would have told me.
But he didn't tell you!
He told me.
He's dying.
Ma.
Ma.
You do understand?
That's the last of it.
Thank you,
Mr. Hutchins.
My position as a teacher, as a maiden lady,
I'm obliged to move to another place.
Of course.
I apologize.
We're ready to go!
Bye.
Some coffee?
Don't mind if I do.
Did you know those two?
Nope.
They sure knew you.
Who were they?
Ben Shoup, the one you killed trying to get out the window.
The other named Norton...
Two no-goods, not from around here.
I've never heard of them.
Quite a night.
Your bedroom looks like a slaughterhouse.
Oh, Mrs. Rogers.
I'll post a man outside nights.
That'll cost the taxpayers
$3.00 a night and $ 10 apiece to plant two corpses.
Death and taxes,
Books.
Keeping you alive to die natural is costing us a pretty penny.
There's no need of any man outside.
I'd appreciate that,
Marshal.
Thank you.
L... I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened last night.
That won't help.
Two men are dead.
I was defending myself.
How are you feeling, a little more poorly every day?
You've got a streak of kindness a mile wide.
That I do.
Tell you what...
Maybe I can help speed things along.
Did you read about the shooting the night before last?
No.
Whooee! That was some shooting.
Pulford, he's the faro dealer, got off one round under fire, straight through the heart, and it measured 84'3".
Maybe I'll just send him here, let him deal you a little faro.
You do that,
Marshal.
This is 19-aught-1.
The old days are gone.
You don't know it.
We've got waterworks, telephones, lights.
We'll have our streetcar electrified by next year, and we've started to pave the streets.
We've still got some weeding to do.
Once we're rid of people like you, we'll have a goddamn
Garden of Eden here.
To put it in a nutshell, you've plain plumb outlived your time.
You couldn't put it in a barrel without a bottom.
You're the longest-winded bastard I ever listened to.
I may be windy, but I ain't ornery.
When my time comes to die,
I won't drag it out.
I'll just do it.
Why don't you?
Thibido...
I don't scare anymore.
Neither did Shoup or Norton.
You wouldn't gun down a police officer.
What'd stop me, fear of dying?

Moses?
Would you care to do business with a voice from the grave?
Mr. Books!
It's pure pleasure to groom your horse!
And even a greater pleasure to do business with you!
Would you kindly step into my office?
Lt'll be a pleasure.
Right this way, please.
Yes, sir.
Now, let me see where I put my spectacles because I wouldn't want to make no, uh... financial mistake.
Yes, sir.
Here they are, Mr. Books.
That's a lot of money, Moses.
Who do I have...
What's this for?
What's it for?
For your horse.
My horse? I want to sell my horse, but this wouldn't buy my saddle.
But, Mr. Books, you done agreed.
When?
When you sent Gilly...
I mean, when Mr. Rogers said this morning
$ 100 would be just fine with you.
I'll have to have a talk with Mr. Rogers.
As far as the horse goes, it's 3.
I might maybe can go 200.
You might maybe go more than that
'cause you'll get more than that 'cause it's mine.
3, and I'll throw the saddle in for cash.
What about my bill?
You throw that in.
I ain't made of money.
Are we going to stand here and haggle all day?
Mr. Books, you the most famous man I ever seen and the second-best haggler.
Who's the best?
Here I stand.
Well, let's get to haggling.
Let's get to haggling.
All right.
Let's get to haggling.
That's 200. 200.
200 there.
No.
No.
Sold.
You mean I did it?
Mr. Books, that makes me the best haggler!
The best in the world, Moses.
Yes, sir.
Gillom!
Gillom!
Where's Gillom?
In the woodshed.
That's appropriate.
Why?
You stay out of this.
Gillom!
I'm in here.
You'll account to me.
Sir?
You were trying to cheat me, and Moses was trying to cheat you.
I'm sorry.
I'm glad of that, but it doesn't... it doesn't tell me very much.
She, uh...
She cried on my shoulder this morning on account of you.
I had to comfort her.
And then the lodgers moved out.
Your room is a mess... and now Ma's worried about losing the house.
Well, I just thought that... that maybe you might want to do something to try and make it up to her.
I thought you might be interested in selling your horse since you're...
Since I'm what?
You're dying.
How did you find that out?
Ma told me.
Guess I'm the last one in town to know about it.
Don't you think you should have talked to me before you tried to sell my horse?
Yes, sir.
I suppose.
But I just wanted to see first if Moses would buy it, that's all.
I'm not a horse thief.
A man's emotions can... tangle him all up sometimes.
I've been operating on the raw edge lately, Gillom.
Guess I just jumped too far too fast.
But, son, I never thought you were a horse thief.
And I hope I can hang around long enough to make it up to you.
Sir... do you think...
Would you give me a shooting lesson?
A shooting lesson?
Well, a man should know how to handle a gun, use it with discretion.
But, uh... you going to tell your mother?
Well... do I have to?
Come on, I'll get us something to shoot with.
It's beautiful.
See that tree on the left with the divided trunk?
You take the right side.
Aim well and put five slugs in it.
Why not six?
You keep your hammer on an empty chamber for safety.
And if you're going out to face somebody?
Load six if your insides tells you to.
Now, take your time.
That's good shooting,
Gillom.
Hey, Mr. Books, my spread's not much bigger than yours.
You did well.
Where did you learn to shoot like that?
Jay Cobb lets me practice with him by the lake... when he's not in jail.
Day before yesterday, he smashed some salesman's jaw.
Nice employer you have.
Well, it's just temporary... till I find whatever's right for me.
Yeah.
Wouldn't I like to see him and Jack Pulford go at it.
Did you hear about what Pulford did?
I did.
Mr. Books.
Yeah?
How did you ever kill so many men?
I lived most of my life in the wild country, and you set a code of laws to live by.
What laws?
I won't be wronged,
I won't be insulted,
I won't be laid a hand on.
I don't do these things to other people, and I require the same from them.
But how could you get into so many fights and always come out on top?
I nearly tied you shooting.
There's nobody up there shooting back at you.
It isn't always being fast or even accurate that counts.
It's being willing.
I found out early that most men, regardless of cause or need, aren't willing.
They blink an eye or draw a breath before they pull the trigger.
I won't.
Bat Masterson told Cobb...
Bat Masterson?
Yeah.
He says that a man has to have, uh... guts, deliberation, and a proficiency with firearms.
Did he mention that third eye you better have?
Third eye?
For that dumb-ass amateur.
It's usually some six-fingered bustard that couldn't hit a cow in the tit with a tin cup that does you in.
But then,
Bat Masterson always was full of sheep dip.
Whoa. I hope you're smart enough to know that that who hit John don't go with guns.
Oh, sure. Yes, sir.
Well, now that we got that cleared up... as my Mexican friend said,
"To the pure life. "
Johnny?
Yes?
May I come in?
Don't... Don't you remember me?
Serepta?
Oh.
Sera, I can't tell you how happy I am you're here.
I came the minute I heard.
Have I changed so much?
No, it's... just been a long time.
It isn't true, is it?
God, how I loved you.
And I loved you.
Is it true?
Oh, no.
Aw, don't cry, Sera.
We all have our time.
I must look a sight.
For sore eyes.
You still with Pardee?
No. He treated me the way I did you.
He just up and skipped.
We should have married.
Spilt milk.
You never did, huh?
No.
Now you're alone.
I'm so glad I'm here.
So am I.
Would you still like to?
We could get a minister and just say I do.
That way, I'd have the certificate.
I'd have something to go on.
Not much.
I'd have your name.
How far would that take you?
Long ways, maybe.
How?
Johnny, you're too modest, you know?
Everybody knows who you are.
I'd be
Mrs. J.B. Books.
I'd be somebody.
That wouldn't buy you any bacon.
Well, it might.
See, that's how come
I knew that you had... that-that you was ailing bad.
This newspaper reporter here tracked me down.
He wants to put out a book on you.
He'll write it and use my name.
The Shootist...
The Life and Bloody
Times ofJ.B. Books by Serepta Books, his wife.
He said in the East that it would sell like hot cakes and he'd split it with me.
And his name is Dobkins.
Right. How did you know?
I kicked him out of here for the same reason.
Johnny, what harm is there in a marriage certificate, a piece of paper?
I don't object to that.
It's the book.
Why?
What does he know about my life?
What do you know?
He says what he doesn't know, he'll make up, and, you know, gory things, shoot-'em-ups and midnight rides and women tearing out their hair.
It will be a corker,
I promise you.
Woman, I still have some pride.
A man should be allowed his human dignity.
I spent $3.00 on the train here.
One-way.
You and Dobkins are two sides of a counterfeit coin.
I'll pay you back.
I'll pay you both ways.
What's wrong about a book?
I'll not be remembered for a pack of lies.
'Cause you're too damn mule mean, that's why.
You always was.
Why should you care what's happening? You're dying.
I have to go on living, and you don't give a hoot in hell what happens!
Why should you?
You won't be here!
God. And I loved you once.
You bastard.
May you rot to death!
# 'Twas blighted affection #
# That made him exclaim #
# Oh, willow tit-willow #
# Tit-willow #
# And if you remain callous #
# And obdurate, I #
# Shall perish as he did #
# And you will know why #
# Though I probably shall not exclaim #
# As I die #
# Oh, willow #
# Tit-willow #
# Tit-willow says I ##
You seem in fine fettle today.
I should be.
I'm full of laudanum.
I'll get your breakfast.
Good. Thank you.
I didn't mean to break up the recital.
Oh, that's all right.
It was just something for the Sunday School class for the church social.
Bond, uh, I've driven off all your other lodgers.
Is it all right if I have breakfast out here?
Of course it is.
I was delighted to see you had a lady caller yesterday.
She asked me not to announce her.
She said she wanted to surprise you.
Were you surprised?
That I was.
Oh, these clothes, uh... they're my
Sunday-go-to-meetings.
I wish you'd give them a good brushing.
Certainly.
They're getting pretty roady.
Nine days on the back of a saddle in a bedroll.
Wouldn't you rather have them cleaned?
That's the general idea.
I mean there's a new method called dry-process cleaning.
It's very good.
How long does it take?
They advertise next-day service, but tomorrow's
Sunday.
I'm afraid I'll have to settle for the brushing
'cause I'll need them first thing Monday morning.
I'll ask. If I can't get them by then,
I'll brush them.
I'll get your ham and eggs.
Just biscuits will do.
My stomach's kind of feeble today.
Oh. You sure you won't want these for church tomorrow?
I don't think so.
You're most welcome to accompany Gillom and me.
Maybe your church won't welcome me.
That's a terrible thing to say.
Doors of the church are open to everyone.
Well, my church has been the mountains and solitude.
No doors at all.
That's hardly the same thing.
We all need a minister to guide us.
Well, if you think of it, give a thought to my soul tomorrow.
I will. I have been praying for you.
I think Gillom has, too.
Thank you.
Thank you both.
Tell me, um... what did he do yesterday that made you so angry?
It isn't what he did.
It's what he didn't do.
We have that straightened out.
You should be proud of Gillom.
He has the making of something special.
I hope so.
I'm going to send
Reverend Saunders to see you tomorrow.
No, thank you.
Maybe it'll make it easier for you.
No.
Just for a few minutes.
Bond, I'm tired of people pawing over my death for this reason or that or for any reason.
A man's death is about the most private thing in his life.
It doesn't belong to Dobkins or Reverend Saunders or Thibido or you.
It's mine.
I suppose that's true of your soul, too.
My soul is what
I've already made of it.
You reprimand me for making judgments with a gun barrel poked in my face, but it's all right for you to judge me on hearsay.
But the hearsay fits.
Maybe I'm better than you've already decided.
Maybe I'm no worse than that good reverend.
Maybe you like being a gunman.
You probably prefer the word shootist.
I don't think of myself as either.
Oh, no. You're some godlike creature of infinite knowledge, aren't you?
I'm a dying man scared of the dark.
Damn you! Damn you for the pain you've brought into this house.
There we are, sir.
Mr. Books.
Yes, sir?
I'm Hezekiah Beckum, the undertaker, sir.
How do you do?
I hope you don't think my stopping by is untimely, sir.
No, I admire a man with get-up-and-go.
As the saying goes in our profession, the early worm gets the bird.
I, uh, admit to having heard some unfortunate things.
I'd like to express my heartfelt regret.
All right.
What's your proposition?
I'm prepared to offer you embalming by the most, uh, scientific methods, a bronze coffin guaranteed good for a century regardless of the climatic or geological conditions, my best hearse, uh, the minister of your choice, and the presence of at least, uh, two mourners... a headstone of the finest
Carrera marble... and a plot in size and location befitting your status, sir... and perpetual care of the grounds.
For how much?
Why, nothing, sir.
For the privilege.
No, I mean how much will you make on the deal?
Oh, Beckum, you're going to do to me what they did to John Wesley Hardin.
You're going to lay me out, let the public gawp at me for 50 cents a head,
10 cents for the children.
When the curiosity peters out, you'll stick me in a hole while you hurry to the bank with your loot.
I assure you...
Give me a scrap of paper and a pencil.
What good's your assurance when my veins are filled with your damn juice?
No. Here's what you're going to do.
First you're going to give me $50 cash.
Then early
Monday morning, you'll bring me a headstone.
I want a small headstone with this written on it.
Nothing else.
No jabbery, no angels.
You got that?
Mr. Books, you're a hard man.
I'm alive.
Ah, very well.
I'll set my stonecutter to work on the inscription immediately.
Mr. Beckum.
The $50.
Oh. Hmm.
Thank you, sir.
Early worm, early worm.
That Beckum is just what you say he is.
Well... now, how much do I owe you?
Not one bitty penny,
Mr. Books.
Why, to watch that performance you done give,
I'd have paid $ 10 in a theater.
Well, I may just accept your generosity.
Besides, I may just see if Beckum would like to buy some of J.B. Books' hair.
With your permission.
Permission granted.
Good day, sir.
What the hell?
And the third man's name is...
Mike Sweeney.
Do you know him?
Sure, I do. He's got one of those horseless carriages.
And now for the favor
I'm going to ask you.
You just tell me, sir.
Anything at all.
Don't dive in till you know how deep it is.
Today's the 27th, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Now, that's Jack Pulford,
Jay Cobb, and Mike Sweeney.
Tomorrow morning early,
I want you to go to each one of them and tell them that I'll be at the
Metropole at 11 A.M.
On Monday the 29th, and don't tell any of them that you've told the others.
Cobb's still in jail.
Yeah, well, tell him anyway.
Think you can do that for me?
Well, I know I can, but, uh, Ma's going to have conniptions if I don't go to church in the morning.
You can go to church first.
I telephoned Moses.
You can ride Old Dollar out to the Sweeney spread.
Yes, sir.
Thank you and... and good night.
Son of a bitch.
Don't cuss.
Yes, sir.
You know that kind of music gets on my nerves, especially on Sunday.
Sorry.
Ma, are you angry at Mr. Books?
Why? What did he say?
Nothing. It's just...
Ma, I'm sorry.
I got to go run some errands for Mr. Books.
I promised him.
Gillom.
Gillom.
I'll be back soon.
Soon as I can.
Oh! Oh!
What happened?
Are you all right?
I slipped in the tub.
Let me help you.
Hell.
Come on, now.
Hang on to me. That's it.
Now sit on the edge of the tub.
I'll get you another towel.
Damn!
John Bernard, you swear too much.
The hell I do.
Put your arm around my shoulder.
Why didn't you ask me to help you in the first place?
I couldn't.
Why not?
I promised you
I wouldn't be a burden.
But you are, so let's just forget about that.
I sure as hell am.
Oh, let me sit down.
Oh, sit down for a minute while I catch my breath.
Oh... well, we finally made it through a full day without having a fight.
Well, we haven't seen each other all day.
You're right there.
You know, Bond, you're such a real lady on the outside.
You're full of vim and vinegar on the inside.
I just never met anybody like you.
You're running low.
I better call Dr. Hostetler and order some more.
No. This'll do.
Oh.
That Morning Appeal.
I've skimmed newspapers all my life.
Never got the whole good out of one.
I bought this the day I arrived, and I said to myself,
"I'm going to read every word, and when I'm done,
"I'll know for a fact exactly what happened on January 22nd in the year 1901."
It was an important day in my life, and now I know.
Would you do me a favor and give this honorable incineration in my stove?
You're getting ready to do something.
What makes you say that?
This... dry cleaning... laudanum... haircut.
I want you to promise me something.
Tomorrow when you see me in all my dry-cleaning splendor and my Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes,
I want you to promise there'll be no questions... no surmises, no woman's intuition.
All curiosity stops right here and now.
Promise me?
And no tears, Bond.
Mr. Books!
In here, Gillom.
Oh, so I see.
No, you don't see.
I was helping Mr. Books out of the bathtub.
What?
You must be hungry.
No, Ma. I'm fine.
I promise.
Thank you.
Well, sir,
I got it done.
Good. How'd you get along with Old Dollar?
Oh, he's a great horse.
You should've seen the look on Marshal Thibido's face when I rode up to the jail.
He must've thought I was you coming to bust Cobb out.
Hardly me.
Which is just about what I did do
'cause Thibido's going to let Cobb out long enough to meet you.
Good.
You'll never guess how Cobb took that.
I bet he jumped with joy.
He got all white, scared to death.
Oh?
Now, Pulford was happy.
He really respects you.
He told me so.
And he sure was polite.
He said, uh,
"I eagerly await the honor... and the privilege of having him try his luck at my faro table. "
We'll have to give it a try.
Now, how about the other fella... Sweeney?
You watch out for him, Mr. Books.
That man is mean, and he hates you.
Well, we'll see if we can't clear that up tomorrow.
Sir, what's...
Thank you. We both ought to get some sleep.
Can I ask you something?
I'm tuckered out.
We'll talk tomorrow.
But I have to be out before sunup, do the milk deliveries while Cobb's in jail.
Then we'll both have a busy morning.
Before you go... there's something
I want to give you.
No, sir. No.
I won't take pay.
And I wouldn't offer it,
Gillom.
But you like Old Dollar, don't you?
Best horse I ever rode.
Well, he's yours.
I bought him back.
Here's the bill of sale.
Now let me get some sleep.
Sir?
Yeah?
When you asked me to do this,
I- I didn't realize... and... and I just hope that nothing...
Just take good care of Old Dollar.
Good night, sir.
Come in.
We got the headstone.
Mr. Beckum...
Good. Just put it there on the bed.
Beckum said as how he done the best he could, but there weren't much time.
Yeah, well, that'll be all right.
Well, I'll be goldarned, if they ain't gone and left the date off.
That'll be all right.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Early for you, ain't it?
Yeah, well,
I'm expecting somebody.
Bring me a cup of coffee, will you, Murray?
Sure.
John Bernard?
Oh.
How grand you look.
Thank you, Bond.
That dry-process cleaning is very good, isn't it?
Yeah, but it's kind of smelly.
Well, that's the naphtha.
Oh, this is my birthday.
I, uh, haven't been to a saloon for a long time, and I thought I'd get a drink and celebrate.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
You have a beautiful day for it.
It's what we call false spring.
Good-bye, Mrs. Rogers.
Good-bye, Mr. Books.
Well, boy, here's your big chance.
Fame and fortune awaits.
After I put that old man out of his misery,
I'm going to get you.
Sure, you will.
Don't wet your pants.
Marshal Thibido!
May I see you for a moment?
What's going on?
Shh! Dobkins, this is law business, not newspaper business.
Adolph S. Ochs is the publisher of the New York Times.
He's asked me for an article on how city officials are reacting to the presence of our famous shootist.
I was thinking of doing a series of stories on you.
Whooee. Let's get the hell off the street.
You tell them that's
Thibido with an "H."
Good morning.
Good morning,
Mr. Books.
You don't give a fella very long to board this thing.
Got a schedule to keep.
Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
Isn't it a beautiful day?
It sure is.
It's what we call a false spring.
Yes, sir?
Glass.
Mr. Sweeney... care to try your luck?
Hmm.
Hmm.
Whoa!
Friend... for you.
What?
Make you a little more comfortable.
Well, sir, these old bones surely thank you.
I sure hope the right fella comes along.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
This is my birthday.
Give me the best in the house.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
And I'll tell you that was for Albert!
Look out!
Hey! Harry!
Come on, else I'm gonna fry up some bread!
Hey! Harry!
God damn! How long have you been boiling these grounds?
Tastes awful sour to me.
Well, you can throw 'em away after this.
We'll be in Del Norte by noon.
We'll buy some fresh.
Arch, these fish aren't bad.
Need some salt, though.
We ain't got none.
That's something else we going to get.
You setting to coast, Dan?
What the hell? We got nothing but time.
And I tell you something.
That is where it's really good, out there in California.
You got your... got your weather.
Your women are half Mex, half American.
And you got your gold.
And oranges.
And the ocean.
They say that ocean looks like a great blue prairie.
I ain't never seen that much water.
Me neither.
This here's the most water I ever saw.
Hey! Harry. You leave the line set?
Well, never can tell.
You might have something.
He's all right, Harry.
He's just young, full of piss and vinegar, like you was.
- Was I like that?
- Near enough.
He's always wanting to go some place he hasn't been.
You really want to go to the coast, don't you?
Good as anywhere. Better than most.
What's your fancy, Harry?
Arch! Harry! Come here quick!
Harry!
What'd you let it go for?
What the hell are you at, anyway?
Hey, what does he think he's doing, letting her float away like that?
Been dead a while, whatever it was.
Whatever it was? What do you mean, whatever it was?
It was a little white girl!
It was a little blonde white girl!
She'd have come to pieces in your hand, the moment you started to pull her in.
Hi.
Hi.
You fellers know where I can find a man to shoe my horse?
Threw a front plate a mile or so back.
Uh... tell me something, boy.
You always ride around in your combinations?
Well, I... I got wet, crossing the river. Thought I'd dry out.
Any of you fellers a blacksmith?
Ain't no blacksmith lives here now.
You want any horseshoeing done, you're gonna have to get it done yourself.
Well... much obliged.
I'm out.
Hey, Luke, looks like we got a gift for Sam.
Well, think I'll have a cold beer.
Well, they ain't got no beer and even if they did have, wouldn't be cold.
They got three kinds of tequila and one of whisky and they're all green and bad.
What kind of town is this, anyway?
Ain't no blacksmith. Ain't no cold beer.
Don't see no girls.
Ain't changed much. That's for sure.
You mean you've been here before?
Yeah, three years ago we was here.
Arch had a bad foot.
Yeah, damn horse stepped on it.
Broke all my toes.
You fellers made up your mind?
Yeah, give us a bottle of
Double Eagle and three glasses.
One Eagle, three glasses.
Well, here's to us. Here's to the coast.
Here's to California.
I ain't going.
How's that, Harry?
I ain't going to the coast.
Where you gonna go, then?
Home.
Now, look, Harry, if it's 'cause of me being so touchy this morning...
Ain't to do with that, Dan.
Home.
Maybe there ain't no such colour.
We get to the coast, it won't be like this.
Where I come from, there's a guy who knew a feller who was on the coast.
Said it was different from anything you ever saw.
Home is just a place you start from, Arch.
There'll be something there.
Think maybe your wife and your little girl are still there?
Didn't know you was married,
Harry, or had kids.
Why don't you go to the coast, make something, send for 'em?
You go to the coast, Dan, and when in three or four years you find yourself sitting here and drinking this rat lotion you remember how you thought it was gonna be.
The hell with him.
The hell, I say. We don't need him.
We can go to the coast without him, can't we, Arch?
You know how long me and him rid together?
I forget. Long time.
Seven years, near on.
Seven years. It's a long time.
You mean you ain't gonna go to the coast?
You're gonna go with Harry?
No, Dan, I ain't gonna go with Harry.
Didn't recognise this place until I saw that peak.
Then I remembered.
Guess I decided then.
It's just a waste, living like this, Arch.
It's been building up a long while.
Well, I'm going with the boy.
Ha. Always wanted to see that ocean.
Come on.
It's a real good 'un, Sam.
It's a real good 'un.
Let's have a look at that bottle.
Hey, boy. There ain't hardly a mouthful left in here.
Have to get another one.
Gonna ride out in the morning?
Not the way I'm drinking this whiskey,
I won't.
How long is it gonna take you to ride back?
A week, thereabouts.
How you know there's anything for you there?
I mean, what if she's married?
Haven't thought on it.
Well.
Well.
You come on out to the coast, maybe we'll meet up again.
Maybe, Arch. Maybe so.
Well, looks like Dan's already been here and cut himself something out.
Well, what'll you have?
Same as your partner?
Well, what did he have?
Well, he had a bit of prime.
Three dollars' worth, to be exact.
- Well, that's Dan for the night.
- Mm.
You might as well give us a couple of shots of that Double Eagle there.
Oh, Mother!
Mother!
Mother, I'm sick.
I'm... I'm sick.
Is he dead?
You shoot him?
This is my wife.
I found him in our house.
He was attacking her.
I called him and I thought he went for his gun.
But I guess he was just pulling on his pants.
I'll take care of the burying.
That's all right. We'll see to it.
How did he find your wife?
Why, I guess he just saw her outside and followed her home.
When I got there, he was all over her.
You mind if I ask her about that?
Well, she don't speak any American.
Won't do you any good.
Don't seem to me there's much to ask.
The woman's all messed up.
Your friend's got his pants half off.
Seems pretty plain to me.
Where can we bury him?
Why don't you just let that go till the morning?
I'll close my canteen and you can let him rest here for the night.
We'll bury him now.
Jesus said, "If those who lead you say to you,
"'See, the Kingdom is in heaven',
"then the birds of the heaven would precede you.
"If they say to you, 'It is in the sea',
"then the fish will precede you.
"But the Kingdom is within you and it is without you."
The disciples said to Jesus
"Tell us how our end will be."
Jesus said, "Have you, then, discovered the beginning,
"that you enquire about the end?
"For where the beginning is, there shall be the end.
"Blessed is he who shall stand at the beginning
"and he shall know the end and not taste death."
His disciples said to Him,
"When will the Kingdom come?"
Jesus said, "It will not come by expectation.
"They will not say, 'See here' or, 'See there.'
"But the Kingdom of the Father is spread upon the earth
"and men do not see it."
We can find out from the kid where he lives.
Let's go!
God! Sam!
Sam! Sam!
What do you mean, what's she like?
Well, I mean, is she tall, thin, fat, round?
Brown hair, blue eyes? What's she like?
Medium.
Red hair.
Brown eyes, I guess.
I think I know her.
She had a nice voice.
How old is she?
How old, hm?
Well, she was 30 when we was married.
And how old was you?
20, just turned.
Hell, boy, you didn't stand a chance.
No, it weren't her fault.
I wasn't ready, that's all.
Too hot to ride and too hot to walk.
Well, it ain't far now.
Wonder what your wife's gonna say to you when she lays eyes on you, Harry.
What I mean is, what kind of nature does she have?
Well, I don't rightly recall.
Only lived with her about a year and nine month.
Well, if I had a horse for a year and nine months,
I'd sure know how many teeth he had.
Well, she had three teeth.
I remember that. Come on.
Hello?
What can I do for you?
Go on inside, Janey.
- I don't want to, Mama.
- Go on. Do like I told you.
How have you been, Hannah?
Why did you come back?
Got tired of the life.
What are you hoping for, coming round here?
Work.
You don't have any right to come back this way.
You think I can't send you away, think you're still married to me, but that ain't so.
Look, Hannah.
Just let me work the place for a bit like a hired hand.
No difference. See how it runs.
I'm asking you, Hannah.
I don't want Janey upset. As far as she knows, her father is dead.
I don't want you saying no different.
Sure.
Come on, Muscatel.
Get ready for bed.
Shout me when you're in.
That wasn't a hundred, Mama. I counted.
Off you go. I'll add them to tomorrow night.
There's some sacks in the shed and some clean straw in the rack.
Should be a lamp there, too.
Tomorrow we'll talk about what you're gonna do.
Needs some thinking, what to put you to.
- Mama, I'm in.
- Coming, Janey.
All right, see you in the morning.
Don't mind me asking, ma'am.
How come you don't have a dog?
I noticed when we rode up there wasn't one.
Had one but it ran away.
Never bothered to get another.
Hm.
Good night, ma'am.
Welcome home, Harry.
Yeah.
Straw smells good.
Beats sleeping on the ground.
Hm. What do you think, Harry?
You think you'll stay?
Harry's turned in.
Ha-ha. He's so tired, he can't see proper.
By your leave, ma'am,
I'll just finish my smoke.
Surely.
What are you getting out of this,
Mr Harris?
Ma'am, if I wasn't doing this,
I'd be doing something else.
You've more prospects in something else.
Well, me and Harry, we rid around together a long time.
He's keen to try this for a while so I'll just string along.
Why did he come back?
Just got tired of drifting around.
He'll go.
Just a matter of time.
Well, most things are, ma'am, one way or the other.
Ask Mr Marshall at the store if that lead paint's come yet.
We can paint the house before winter comes.
And don't forget the jars for preserving fruit.
And don't forget my candy.
Candy? You don't eat candy, do you?
Look there. It's written down, candy for Janey.
Huh? Ha-ha-ha-ha!
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Come on. Hey.
- Goodbye, Janey.
- Goodbye.
Whoa.
I'll go on over the general store.
You go set up the beers.
Sounds like a reasonable division of labour.
Go.
Give me two beers.
Hello there.
- You riding on through?
- No, sir, we picked up a job.
You and somebody else?
Yes, sir. We're working for Miss Collings.
Oh, both of you?
Yes, sir, that's right.
Well, now, she's really getting down to some serious business.
She's a fair woman to work for, all right.
Fair?
Why, the widow Collings is more than fair. She's downright generous.
Can always tell a man's got something on his mind.
He keeps talking to people he don't know.
Well, what is it you're trying to tell me?
What I'm trying to tell you, mister, is that most men who work for the widow Collings get paid in more than cash and keep.
I'll sure remember that.
Save me getting a lot of fancy notions.
And you can tell her when you get back, that Ed Plummer might take a ride out to see her, one of these moonshine nights.
What's he talking about, Arch?
Ah, there's your partner.
How do you work it, boys? Night about? Or do you each do a week?
He was talking about Hannah, wasn't he?
Was he?
You know he was. That's why you hit him.
Stopped him from saying something about her.
What was it, Arch?
Said she slept with the hired help.
Now, I'm warning you, Harry, if you're gonna swing at me,
I'll take a great deal of pleasure in kicking the living shit out of you.
- Do you believe him?
- He was a mouth-off.
It's the kind of story you find in any saloon.
- You really believe that, Arch?
- Of course I do.
I ain't saying your Hannah never looked the side a man was on.
But I sure don't believe what that feller was saying.
If I was you, Harry, I wouldn't be putting no questions to her.
She ain't gonna take too kindly to you setting up judgment on her.
Get up. Ah.
Did I get the feeling your friend
Harris made himself scarce?
Could be.
Why could that be, now?
I guess he knows I want to talk to you.
What about?
I hope you ain't getting ready to propose.
In town today, someone said...
They made some remarks about you.
What sort of remarks?
About you and the men that worked here.
Go on. What did they say?
You know what they said.
They said you slept with all your hired hands.
You hired men to sleep with.
God, what do you know about it?
- How many?
- Does it matter?
Of course it matters.
You were long gone before anybody got into my bed.
And don't think that's 'cause I was hankering after you. I wasn't.
That was as long as I could stand it.
I walked about this room on nights like this, going crazy for a man.
Any man. Didn't matter.
And sometimes when there was a man out there, he knew about it and he'd come in and sometimes I'd have him or he'd have me, whatever suits you.
But not all of them and not every time I wanted to.
And when the season's work was over
I'd pay him off, no matter how well he'd worked or how well he'd pleased me,
'cause the man that's in a woman's bed thinks he's her boss and sooner or later they'd have tried to move their tackle out of the shed and in here, and I didn't want that,
'cause I'd already had one man in here and I didn't want another.
Is that all you want to ask me?
Mrs Collings?
Mrs Collings?
Oh, I was just passing.
Thought I'd drop by.
I never seem to catch you in town, somehow.
Hello, Mrs Sorenson.
It's not often I get visits from your good self.
I was so glad to hear the news.
I'm sure you're very pleased.
Oh?
Well, I saw the paper with my very own eyes.
Carl said he recognised him in town today, but I said that wasn't possible, because we hadn't even come to town in those days.
But I'm sure you're very pleased.
Janey, you go on outside and play for a bit.
And I'll bet you're pleased too, aren't you, little Janey?
Go on, Janey.
Go on outside, like I told you.
I assume you're talking about the fact that Harry's come back?
Oh, yes, of course.
Maybe we'll see you in town at the quiltings and all.
Folks are always saying what a pity you never get into town.
Mrs Sorenson, I didn't know that he was coming back and I don't know how long he'll stay.
I don't want Janey upset.
She thinks her father's dead.
If she finds out different and if he goes off again...
He's not going anywhere.
Didn't he show you what he wrote?
He had it up all over town.
"No further need of hired help," it said.
Man that does that isn't thinking of going nowhere.
Your husband isn't around?
I'd so like to meet him.
You know, Carl and I were still in Philadelphia then.
No.
He's out on the farm.
Oh, I see.
Well, I just dropped by to say hello.
We'll be looking for you in town.
Folks'll be looking out, now that your man's come home.
- Goodbye, Mrs Sorenson.
- Goodbye, Mrs Collings.
Oh, and give my very best to Mr Collings.
Thank you.
You know that he wants to stay here?
I gathered that.
What do you think about it?
Well, that ain't for me to think.
You don't have to worry about me hanging around.
You probably think I'm pretty hard.
Now, ma'am, that's not for me to decide.
Well, I am.
Don't want to be, but I am.
I don't know how many nights
I sat on the porch, rocking myself back and forth watching the shed, hoping whoever was in there would come out, hoping and terrified in case he did.
It was all right at the time out in the field or in the hay, sometimes just down on the dirt.
That's right.
You can tell, can't you?
Wouldn't really matter whether it was you or him tonight.
You think he'll be happy here?
There'll be times when he'll be happy.
If you really want him, ma'am you're gonna have to tell him and you're gonna have to tell yourself too.
What are you talking, Arch?
What's this about heading west?
Well, you're settled in here now, Harry.
I thought I'd go back to our old plan and go on out to California.
But you like it here. I know you do.
He suits it here, doesn't he?
Reckon if Arch wants to go on, we shouldn't argue with him.
It's better this way, Harry.
Best thing.
You really want to go to California,
Arch? See that ocean?
Sure do.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
OK, Arch, that's what you wanted.
I think this is how it has to be, Harry.
Did you ask him to go?
No, I never did.
But you want him to, don't you?
I want you to stay. That's what I want.
But I will stay. I told you so.
With me. Because of me, me and Janey.
- That's why I came back, ain't it?
- Partly.
Partly because you were tired, sick and weary of having no place but the ground to sleep.
Harry, I'm all aching and sore from these last six years.
I feel I'm gonna split open.
I'm scared to think it might all come right again, after all this time.
I don't believe it.
But I want it to be.
Can you understand that?
I guess so, Hannah.
That man out there.
He's a decent man, I'm sure.
But he's had more of you than I've ever known.
He's what you left me for, Harry.
I know you didn't know him when you left.
But he's what you went looking for.
A man don't ask for things of another man like a woman does.
He's easier to please and he don't get bitter about the same things.
Each time you and me didn't get along, each time you got weary, he'd be there and I'd wonder if you were planning to go off with him or if he'd be telling you not to be a fool.
Don't you see, Harry?
It'd be just like you came home with some woman you'd been living with and said, "I want her to stay in the spare room."
Out there, where he's going,
Hannah, it's cold on your own.
Don't you think it's about time you started practising being a husband again, Harry?
I'll pick it up OK.
Good night, Harry.
Sure is a good morning for it.
You make it back this way...
Sure.
Arch?
If it gets, uh... you know, the way it can out there, you just turn around.
I'll bring him back a bottle of that ocean water.
Goodbye, Mr Harris.
Goodbye, Janey.
I hope I'll be all right for you, Harry.
Just checking Janey.
She's all right. Wind didn't waken her.
I love you, Harry.
I love you too, Hannah.
Harry! Harry.
There's a funny man and he brought
Mr Harris's horse back.
Where did you get this horse?
Sam sent me with him.
Where's Harris?
He wants you to come see him.
Where is he?
Waiting for you.
- What is it, Harry?
- It's Arch. Something's wrong.
Is he sick?
Not exactly. He sent you this.
Sam says, each week you don't show up, he's gonna take off another.
And if you don't show up ever, he's gonna cut off his toes and all.
Ha!
- Harry, what are you doing?
- They cut off one of Arch's fingers.
One each week, they say, till I get there.
How do you know it's his finger?
It sure as hell is somebody's finger and, seeing as they got Arch,
I reckon it's his, OK?
Yeah.
Harry, you can't.
You came back. You said...
You said you'd come back.
You can't go away. You can't.
The longer I wait, the worse it'll be for him, Hannah.
I don't care about him!
I care about me and Janey and you!
You never meant to stay. You never.
You planned it, the two of you!
You planned it!
It's your way of getting away again!
You planned it!
That's not true, Hannah. I have to go.
Arch is in this trouble because of me. I have to get him out of it.
Now, when that's done, I'll be back and things'll be right.
You won't come back. I know it.
Your discard, you know.
'Agua.
'Por favor.'
Está bien. Come on. Come on!
Come on, come on.
Give me... Give me a little water.
Yeah, that's it. That's all right.
Get me a gun.
Pistol.
No.
Me mata. No.
I'll kill him.
Me mata.
Vete de aquí.
Pistol?
You can count your fingers now.
Your friend's come to get you.
Mighty good to see you.
I've been looking pretty hard for you and that's difficult, seeing as it's very hard for me to get about.
- Where's Harris?
- He's here.
You rid hard. You saved him a finger.
They were bad ones, Harry.
Knew it.
First time we was here... had a feeling.
Then when we rode out... thought it was all left behind.
Hold me, Arch.

She said, "Vernon, you are the only man
"who ever made my bell ring.
"All my love, Red Snapper.

And maybe you'll be happy because at least you had the chance to sing for Senior Greaser.
- You‘re on.
- If you feel, you heal.

- Seaweed head, last night I called on that German girl up in Los Alamos.
Round about midnight I put my nose in her cunny and rubbed it back and forth, back and forth, and up and down, and back and forth, and she went to sleep on me.
While she was sleepin' I pulled out my John Thomas and did the deed and she woke up screamin‘,
"Wernon, it hurts, it hurts!"
And I said, "No it don't, no it don't," and she said, "Wernon, Wernon, aah Wernon!"
— Coo Coo,
| wish I could put my arms around each and every one of them and let them know that everything is going to be okay.
- Why don‘t ya, Sea?
- I'm not bizarre enough.

Miss Greaser, if you'd be my woman

I bring you a message
Exactly six miles north of Skag Mountain in the Valley of Pain there lives an evil devil monster.
His name is Bingo Gas Station Motel Cheeseburger
With A Side Of Aircraft Noise And You'll Be Gary Indiana and he loves to hurt people.
The last time I saw Bingo Gas Station
Motel Cheeseburger With A Side Of Aircraft Noise
And You'll Be Gary Indiana he told me what he wants to do.
He wants to come down here and kill each and every one of you.
But I said to him, "Bingo, wait a minute," and the reason I said that is because I believe in you people.
I believe you can do the job.
I believe you can help each other.
I believe you can make this world a better place to live in.
That's it.
- Never mind this, how you say, Bingo.
Just tell us whether there is a life after death or not.
- Seaweed head, last Tuesday night
I took my favorite Chiquita out on the mesa.
We cozied for six days and six nights without food and without sleep.
When we ﬁnally stopped I said,
"Chiquita from now on I'm callin' you Vagina Lips."
She said, "Vernon, you call me anything you want."
- Oh, I'd like you to meet my daughter, Cholera.
Chol, this is the man who walked on the water.
- It‘s show time.
- She's alreet, Daddy.
- (chuckles) That's mighty ﬁne, mighty ﬁne.
I do believe it's show time.
- [Man] Cholera!
- [Man] Mr. Greaser, that was it.
- [Seaweed] What?
- Give me a chance up there, baby!
- [Seaweed] What?
- Give me a shot.
- Take it.

- It's the greatest thing I've ever seen.
Let‘s talk.
- You'll have to see my agent.
I'm with the agent Morris.
- I don't care who you're with.
It's the greatest thing I‘ve ever seen.
Let‘s talk.
- In my whole life, that's the worst act I've ever seen.
You ruin career!
How do you do that material with a straight face?
You embarrass me!
- [Jessy] Morris, please.
- Forget it!
You‘re totally out of the question.
There's no way for you.
- Morris, I know I can do it!
- Later.
- I'll be back.
— C00 C00.
Chol, it‘s me.
-A man with holes in his hands gets a bigger applause than me and you talk of greatness?
- [Seaweed] Cholera, there are different kinds of greatnesses.
- Don‘t preach to me, Dad.
- Mr. Greaser?
- [Seaweed] What?
- I am sorry but I have to have my dog back and, uh...
But Lamy Homo has my dog and he won't give it back.
- Son, give the man back his dog.
- [Man] Thank you very, very much, Lamy.
- Dad, I was swimming in a rainbow with millions of babies and they was naked and then all of the sudden I turned into a perfect smile just like last time.
Dad, I don‘t wanna die anymore.
- [Seaweed] Then behave yourself!
- [Lamy] Dad, can I buy you a whiskey?
- [Seaweed] That's mighty fine, Lamy, mighty fine.
Lamy, you're not a Homo, you're a Greaser. (chuckles)
- [Lamy] Thanks, Dad.
- Come on.
- I love ya, Dad.
I love ya, Dad.
I love ya, Dad.
I love ya, Dad.
I love you.
I love ya, Dad.
- I took my pants off.
I hope you don't mind.
- I love you.
I love you.
I love you. - Oh Jessy.
- I love you.
I love you. - Oh!
- I love you. - Oh!
- I love you. - Oh, oh.
Jessy, oh! - I adore you.
I love you so much. (Cholera groaning)
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
- [Cholera] (cries out) Oh, God!
- [Jessy] Oh.
- (sighs) Oh Jessy.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
- [Jessy] I love you so much.
- Do it.
Do it!
- What? - Do it.
- What? - Now!
Now, now, now! (cries out)
Oh God, now, now, now!
Yes, yes, now! (groans)
- Marry me! - Jessy.
- [Jessy] I love everybody!
— Oh God.
Oh God!
You're unbelievable!
Oh God, oh. (cries out) -Ah, ah!
I love you.
- [Cholera] Oh, don't stop.
Don't stop.
Don't stop.
- [Seaweed] Ah.
- Thank you.
Where's father?
- [Ghost] Who knows?
- Maybe something is wrong.
I don‘t wanna leave.
- [Ghost] You're goin'.
- [Jessy] I wish I were you.
- [Ghost] Nobody knows who I am and nobody cares either.
- It's time.
- [Jessy] Father, I can't do it.
— Why?
- I think I found myself and I really don't trust you.
- You get moving.
Jessy.

l am, beyond a doubt,
the last of the old-timers,
My name is Jack Crabb, and I am the soIe white survivor of the BattIe of LittIe Bighorn, popuIarIy known as Custer's Last Stand.
WeII, Mr Crabb,
I'm more interested in the primitive
IifestyIe of the PIains Indian than I am in...
(LAUGHS ) ...taII taIes about Custer.
TaII taIes?
Are you caIIing me a Iiar?
No, no. It's just that...
I'm interested in the way of Iife of the Indian, rather than, shaII we say, adventure.
You think the BattIe of LittIe Bighorn was an adventure?
LittIe Bighorn was not representative of encounters between whites and Indians, Mr Crabb.
You see, the near genocide of the Indian...
- The near what?
- Near genocide.
It means...
...extermination.
The kiIIing off of an entire peopIe.
That's practicaIIy what we did to the Indian.
But, of course, I wouIdn't expect an oId Indian fighter, Iike you, to agree with me.
- Turn that thing on.
- Pardon?
I said, turn that thing on and shut up.
You sit there and you'II Iearn something.
I knowed GeneraI
George Armstrong Custer for what he was, and I aIso knowed the Indians for what they was.
1 1 1 years ago, when I was ten years oId, my famiIy, in crossing the Great PIains,
was wiped out
by a band of wild lndians,
Everybody was killed or drug off
by them murdering varmints
except me and my sister Caroline,
(MUSlC: DOLEFUL HARMONlCA)
Ah! Oh!
Bye, Jack. I'II see you in heaven.
Goodbye, CaroIine.
We didn't know the difference then,
but it was a band of Pawnee
what attacked us,
l ain't had no use
for Pawnee ever since,
But this one wasn't a Pawnee,
He was a Cheyenne brave,
l later got to know him well,
His name was
Shadow That Comes ln Sight,
At first sight of an lndian camp,
what you think is:
''l see their dump, Where's the camp?''
He brought us to their chief,
His name was Old Lodge Skins,
who later become my granddaddy,
What do they want, CaroIine?
It's as pIain as day what they want, Jack.
What?
Me.
To show good manners,
Old Lodge Skins smoked
with our oldest male survivor,
They didn't know I was a woman.
That expIains why they didn't rape me right off.
I don't think they're going to bother you.
No such Iuck, Jack.
They'II get me tonight, for sure.
Poor Caroline never did have
no luck with men,
l reckon she figured
we both couldn't get away
and she'd send help to rescue me,
The next morning, l found myself
in that lndian camp all alone,
But the Cheyenne, who call
themselves the Human Beings,
had no idea to hurt me,
l was an honoured guest
and they gave me a treat, Boiled dog,
Dog ain't bad, neither,
Greasy, l'll admit,
but you'd be surprised
how delicate the flavour is,
especially when you're starving,
You see, the Human Beings
adopted me as one of their own,
Shadow That Comes ln Sight
taught me the bow and arrow
and how to stalk game,
Burns Red ln The Sun showed me how
to protect my pale skin from sunburn,
lt's little known that some lndians,
like Burns Red,
will sunburn their own selves,
But my real teacher was my adopted
grandpa, Old Lodge Skins,
He taught me to read a trail, Cheyenne
language and lots of other things,
For a boy, it was a kind of paradise,
l wasn't just playing lndian,
l was living lndian,
Only one thing bothered me:
l was small for my years,
ln fact, darn near a runt,
The Pawnee stoIe seven ponies.
There's going to be a war party.
But you can't go. You're too IittIe and weak, Iike a girI.
Run away now or I'II kick you.
The lndians had never heard
of fist fighting, and it amazed them,
How did you do that?
I'm sorry, Younger Bear.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
The lndian way: never feel sorry
about beating an enemy
unless, having conquered his body,
you want his spirit as well,
l had made the first real enemy
of my life,
There once was a Human Being, and he was very smaII.
But he won a name: LittIe Man.
You've heard of him?
No, Grandfather.
He went on a war party against the Pawnees.
But the Pawnees were many.
One by one, the Human Beings were rubbed out.
LittIe Man was very brave.
The Pawnees caIIed out to him,
''If you wiII quit fighting, we wiII Iet you go.''
But LittIe Man answered,
''It's a good day to die.''
FinaIIy, they cut off his head, but he kept fighting without his head.
He rode among the Pawnees
Iike a whirIwind, and his head, which was stuck on a spear, started to shout the war cry.
The Pawnees couId take no more, and they ran away.
When they Iooked back, they saw the body of LittIe Man
Iie down among his friends.
LittIe Man was smaII, but his bravery was big.
The Human Beings don't require
a boy to be a warrior
if he ain't got the temperament,
and Little Horse didn't,
lf he wanted to stay
with the women,
that was all right
with the Human Beings,
We wiII Ieave the ponies here.
You hoId them.
No! I don't want to.
I want to go to the Pawnee camp.
You... You aren't even a Human Being.
You're white.
He didn't believe it himself,
Younger Bear was just trying
to hand me the worst possible insult,
Ah! Ah!
LittIe White Man...
...fooI poor Pawnee.
Big fooIing. You want to eat?
Pawnees was always
sucking up to whites,
LittIe White Man not mad, huh?
See? Pawnee friend.
Fix this bad Indian for LittIe White Man.
Uh!
l always felt kind of bad
about that poor Pawnee,
l didn't mean to kill him,
l just meant to distract him,
l had made a real enemy
of Younger Bear,
I give you these ponies, but...I owe you a Iife.
Saving his life was the final insult,
This boy is no Ionger a boy.
He is a brave. He is IittIe in body, but his heart is big.
His name shaII be LittIe Big Man.
I don't understand it. Why wouId they kiII women and chiIdren?
Because they are strange.
They do not seem to know where the centre of the earth is.
We must have a war on these cowards and teach them a Iesson.
(BEATING ON DRUMS
AND CHANTING )
This wiII be the first time, my son,
I face the whites as an enemy.
I don't know whether you remember before you became a Human Being and as dear a son to me as those I made with
BuffaIo WaIIow Woman and the others, but I won't speak of that unfortunate time.
I just want to say, if you beIieve riding against these white creatures is bad, you can stay out of the fight.
No one wiII think the worse.
Grandfather, I think it's a good day to die.
My heart soars Iike a hawk.
l'm sorry to say that Old Lodge Skins'
war against the whites
was kind of pitiful,
Not that the Human Being
wasn't brave,
No warrior ever walked the earth
more brave than a Human Being,
But Old Lodge Skins' idea of war
was different from the whites',
Half our party didn't use weapons,
They ''took coup'',
hit the enemy with a little stick,
Humiliate them,
That was how a Human Being
taught a coward a lesson
and won a war,
Shadow!
Repeating rifles
against bow and arrow,
l never understood how the whites
could be so proud of winning
with them kind of odds,
Yee...argh... !
God bIess George Washington!
Before l knowed it,
them words popped out,
God bIess my mother!
You murdering fooI!
Do I have to cut your throat before you see I'm white?
- White?
- Sure I'm white.
Didn't I say, ''God bIess Washington and my mother''?
What kind of Indian wouId say a fooI thing Iike that?
Lend me that to get off this paint.
The troopers took me
and turned me over
to the Reverend Silas Pendrake,
for moral guidance
and a Christian upbringing,
- Can you drive a buggy, boy?
- Oh, yes, sir. I can do it.
You're a Iiar, boy.
If you was reared by the Indians, how couId you Iearn to drive a buggy?
We shaII have to beat the Iying out of you.
(MUSlC: DOLEFUL HARMONlCA)
Dear Jack.
WeIcome to your new home.
Your travaiI is over, enfoIded now as you are in Christian Iove.
WeII, boy, are you unabIe to converse?
- No, I'm gIad to meet your daughter.
- You are addressing my wife.
Poor boy. Poor darIing.
Think of the years of suffering, deprivation and hardship among those awfuI savages.
The boy's deprivation, my dear, has been more spirituaI than physicaI.
The Indians know nothing of God and moraI right.
They eat human fIesh, fornicate, aduIterise, misogynise and commune constantIy with minions of the deviI.
It must be our task... nay, our Christian duty,
- to beat the misery out.
- Beat the poor boy?
- Not whiIe there's breath in my body.
- l could have kissed her,
I didn't mean beat him IiteraIIy.
I meant beat him symboIicaIIy.
Poor boy. He hasn't even had a proper bath.
- I detect the odour of food.
- I shaII wash this poor boy.
It's supper time.
It is my Christian duty to give this boy an immediate, thorough bath.
- Take your cIothes off.
- Off?
- Yes.
- AII of them?
Every stitch. But I shaII avert my eyes at the necessary moment.
# Bringing in the sheaves
# Bringing in the sheaves
# We shaII come rejoicing
# Bringing in the sheaves #
Greatest bath l ever had in my life,
# ShaII we gather at the river?
# The beautifuI, the beautifuI river #
You do reaIise, don't you, dear Jack, that the Reverend Pendrake is not aItogether wrong?
What? I mean, what, ma'am?
WeII, Jesus is your saviour.
- You do reaIise that, don't you?
- Oh, Lordy. Yes, Mrs Pendrake.
Are you thinking of Jesus, Jack?
Yes'm. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
- You mustn't fib to me.
- Oh, no.
I Iove Jesus and Moses and aII of them.
There's quite a difference.
Moses was a Hebrew, but Jesus was a GentiIe,
Iike you and me.
Ain't you done washing that boy yet?
I'm giving the chiId reIigious instruction.
I want to eat.
Looks Iike a weII-growed chiId, if you ask me.
AII right now, dear. PIease stand up and Iet me dry you off.
I shaII avert my eyes, of course.
Now step out of the tub.
ActuaIIy, you are rather weII-grown, Jack.
You're smaII, but...nice-Iooking.
Did you know that?
- No, ma'am.
- WeII, you are.
AII the more reason for you to receive reIigious instruction.
The girIs, I'm sure, wiII aII be after you.
- And, Jack...
- Ma'am?
That way Iies madness.
What way, ma'am?
You'II understand these things better when you're oIder.
The point is, my dear boy, that we aII must resist temptation.
Purity is its own reward.
Dear Jack...
WeIcome to your new home.
(BREATHLESS ) Now dress...
...and come in to supper.
l went to school and learned all over
how to read and write and cipher,
lt was strange at first,
but Mrs Pendrake tutored me
and l learned fast,
But there was one thing
l didn't know about
and that was a thing called sin,
I caught you at the gates of heII!
Boy, the hand of God must smite the carcass of man.
It's worth it, dear Jack.
It's worth it a miIIion times over to be pure and good, to waIk in the paths of righteousness.
There's no happiness Iike it.
Do you beIieve me, Jack?
Do you beIieve me?
Yes, ma'am. I sure do.
# Amazing grace... #
So it was
l entered my religion period,
l was a great little hymn singer,
and l wasn't fooling,
l'd been saved,
I baptise you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the HoIy Spirit.
O Lord, Iook down upon this poor boy who Iived among the heathen and cIeanse him of the corruption of their fouI, pagan ways and make him white again as the snow.
Let him be reborn and repurified in thy name.
I baptise you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the HoIy Spirit.
Amen.
Mrs Pendrake was right
about temptation,
l'd have nothing to do
with them Jezebels,
l told her about my triumph
over temptation,
and we read the Bible
for about an hour to celebrate,
As the weeks went by, l fell more
and more in love with Mrs Pendrake,,,
,,,spiritually, of course,
I shaII be off for my shopping.
The boy's doing so poor these days, why not take him aIong and air him?
- He'd be bored with the shopping.
- No, I wouIdn't, ma'am.
AII right, then.
You come with me, Jack.
Good morning, Mr Kane.
This is Jack, my adopted son.
What's your pIeasure, ma'am?
WeII, Iet's see.
I think I shaII have a sassafras fIip.
How about you, buster?
Oh. Yeah, I'II have the same.
Never mind for me.
I must do my shopping.
It wouId bore you terribIy, Jack.
You stay here and have some cake.
- I'II take care of him, Mrs Pendrake.
- Thank you very much, Mr Kane.
That soda shop was something,
Especially that elephant-head spigot,
l was playing with it
and enjoying myself,
Then, all of a sudden,
an awful feeling run through me,
Where had that fellow gone to?
(MRS PENDRAKE) Don't.
Don't. No, don't.
Oh, yeah. No, don't...
Yeah, pIease. No, don't.
(GIGGLING ) Pagan beast.
HeIp!
You deviI. You fiIthy, dirty deviI.
Heathen.
No, no...yeah, yeah, yeah.
No. HeIp! HeIp! HeIp. I'm dying.
(JACK) She was calling him a devil
and moaning for help,
but l didn't get no idea
she wanted to be rescued,
That was the end
of my religion period,
l ain't sung a hymn in 1 04 years,
After starving a while,
l took up with a swindler,
name of Allardyce T Meriweather,
After Mrs Pendrake, his honesty
was downright refreshing,
(MERIWEATHER) It is my mission to pass on to you...
Meriweather was one
of the smartest men l ever knowed,
but he tended to lose
parts of himself,
When l joined him, his left hand
and his left ear were already gone,
We might see a miracIe, one I have witnessed before.
The power of this eIixir has been proven...
(CRIES OUT) WaIk!
WaIk!
During my years with Meriweather,
he lost an eye
as a result of a fifth ace
dropping out his sleeve
in a poker game,
lt didn't faze him, though,
Deception was his life's blood,
even if it caused him to get
whittled down kind of gradual like,
You're improving. You just can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty.
The one that ruined you was that Indian, OId Tepee.
- You mean OId Lodge Skins?
- He gave you a vision of moraI order in the universe, and there isn't any.
Those stars twinkIe in a void, dear boy, and the two-Iegged creature schemes and dreams beneath them, aII in vain.
AII in vain, Jack.
- You hear anything?
- Listen to me!
Men wiII beIieve anything, the more preposterous the better.
WhaIes speak French at the bottom of the sea.
The horses of Arabia have siIver wings.
Pygmies mate with eIephants in darkest Africa.
I have soId aII those propositions.
WeII, maybe we're aII fooIs and none of it matters.
Ah...
You stay with AIIardyce Meriweather, and you'II wear siIk.
I don't know as I want to wear siIk.
My dear boy, what eIse can a man of parts wear than siIk?
Tar and feathers, I reckon.
AII right. Sit right there.
Don't make no moves unIess you want a IittIe dayIight in your Iiver.
What, may I ask, brings you out into the wiIds at this hour, sir?
- That them?
- Yes.
I've seen this young one before.
- I've never been in this country.
- You Iook famiIiar, bub.
Oh! Sir...
What's in there? Lye?
You can't expect me to reveaI its constituents.
Sir, pIease.
You're wasting precious medicine.
Seven foIks are haIf-dead because of this. What's in it?
Nothing harmfuI, I assure you.
- What?
- MostIy water.
Whiskey, a IittIe pepper, oiI of cIoves, ginger root...
- What's that?
- What's what?
Oh, that. It's a dozen snake heads, to give it strength.
AII right, boys.
Yee-ha... !
Got caught, Jack, that's aII.
Life contains a particIe of risk.
- You don't know when you're Iicked.
- Licked?
I'm not Iicked.
I'm tarred and feathered, that's aII.
AII right, boys.
I reckon they've been rode enough.
- Why, Hickok himseIf can't hit three.
- Throw up three.
What's your name, son?
- Jack Crabb.
- Lord above!
I've tarred and feathered my own brother!
It's wonderfuI, Jack.
I can give you something you never had before, and something I never had before, neither...
...a reaI...famiIy Iife.
Yeah.
You are back in the bosom of your famiIy, Jack.
OK, now you.
I don't know anything about guns.
I never even carried none.
Lord! What kind of upbringing did them Indians give you?
Never carried no gun? Why, a man ain't compIete without a gun.
- Go snake-eyed.
- Do what?
Like this.
Like this.
AII right.
Now...
Draw and shoot that bottIe before you touch the gun.
How can I draw and shoot the gun before I touch it?
Concentrate. Try it.
Hot damn! Yeah.
Caroline was right,
lt is possible to shoot a gun
before you touch it,
'Course, it takes lightning reflexes,,,
and considerable
snake-eyed concentration,
Throw up three.
- Why, Hickok himseIf can't hit three.
- Throw up three.
NaturaI-born gunfighter.
So it was l entered
my gunfighter period,
You're crowding me.
I didn't see you. I'm sorry.
It's stupid of me to take up aII that room.
- Set me up with a soda pop.
- Yes, sir. Right away, kid.
The Soda Pop Kid,
that's what they called me,
Soda pop, he wants.
- Anything wrong with that, stranger?
- No, not a thing, friend.
In fact, I admire the styIe of you.
Might I ask who I are addressing?
I'm WiId BiII Hickok.
WeII, I'm...
- I'm pIeased to meet you.
- The pIeasure's mutuaI, friend.
Bring your soda pop over here and sit for a whiIe.
I can break three bottIes throwed in the air.
That's shooting.
How many men have you...
...gunned down?
I don't rightIy recoIIect.
How many have you?
Oh, about...
...two dozen.
- That a fact?
- No, it wasn't a fact at all,
During my gunfighter period,
l was an awful liar,
I wouIdn't have estimated your totaI that high.
No offence intended, but you don't have the Iook of murder in your eye.
Like that buzzard over there.
Him? WeII, he's just a common drunk.
Hm...
What are you so nervous about?
Getting shot.
I got a fuII house!
I got a...fuII house.
Now you've got me doing it.
Sorry.
HoId the fort a whiIe, oId horse, whiIe I get another bottIe.
Did you know the man, BiII?
Never saw the gent before.
Mr Hickok, that man is reaIIy dead.
Got him through the Iungs and heart, both.
SeIIing your gunfighter outfit?
Turning in your gun?
- WeII, sorry, CaroIine.
- There ain't nothing more useIess than a gunfighter who can't shoot peopIe.
Men!
Ah-har!
There went the bosom of my family,
Having tried religion, snake-oil
and gunfighting unsuccessfully,
l took a partner,
become a respectable storekeeper,
and married Olga, a Swedish girl
who couldn't hardly speak no English,
Preserve the moment.
Yes.
OIga, shaII I carry you over the threshoId?
Ja?
- It's a custom.
- Ja?
WeII, it ain't much now, OIga, but me and my partner, we got big pIans.
Free enterprise and honest sweat.
Ja, Ja,
I don't understand this biII.
Looks Iike I'm being charged twice.
Ja, the biIIs of the store.
There must be an error. Jack
AppIebound wouIdn't do that to me.
Jack, enough the biIIs.
Come and get some rest.
I must be making a mistake.
Jack, the rest, the body.
You needs it.
Yeah.
Maybe I do.
Rest.
OIga. OIga, come on.
We'II get out of this somehow.
One little thing about my new
business partner: he was a thief,
(AUC TlONEER) ,,,25 cents for
this glorious musical instrument,
Look at this beautiful instrument,
Who will take it?
- That is a pathetic scene.
- Yes, sir.
A ruined and desoIate famiIy wiped out by economic misfortune.
I find it touching.
l'll never forget the first time
l set eyes
on General George Armstrong Custer,
(OLGA) Ruined! That's what we used to have. Ruined!
Do you have another trade?
WeII, GeneraI, I... Not exactIy.
Then take my advice. Go west.
West?!
- My wife is scared of Indians.
- You have nothing to fear.
I give you my personaI guarantee.
OIga! OIga!
- Hit him! Hit him!
- Sorry, brother.
I think we're going to get away.
- Let me at him! I've got a gun here.
- We must be civiIised.
''And it came to pass after the pIague that the Lord spake...''
Grab the reins! Grab the reins!
- Give it! Give me that shotgun.
- No, it's mine!
- (UNINTELLIGIBLE RANTING )
- Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!
Yee-haa!
Ah! Get back!
Come on, get back!
Jack!
Get back.
I'II protect you.
Aaah... !
OIga!
OIga!
OIga.
l covered most of three states
and hundreds of square miles
looking for Olga, with no luck at all,
- Hey, Crabb.
- Whiskey, whiskey...
For a drink of whiskey, they'II give you a squaw.
Sure save you a Iot of Iooking.
l looked everywhere for my wife
but couldn't find her,
Finally, l had to go deeper
into Cheyenne country,
l didn't figure for me
it was dangerous,
speaking Cheyenne and having
once been a Human Being myself,
- KiII him.
- I didn't steaI, brother.
Why do you caII me ''brother''?
Don't. I am not your brother.
I am a Human Being.
I suppose you wiII say you have never heard of LittIe Big Man.
LittIe Big Man was my brother, but you're not him.
He was kiIIed after rubbing out many bIuecoats.
Did you see the body?
No, he turned into a swaIIow and fIew away.
- Let's kiII him.
- Shadow! You were shot.
I put you on a pony.
I saved you.
Dirt On The Nose, do you stiII have the pony I gave you?
No. The Pawnee stoIe him when we camped at the OId Woman Butte five snows ago.
It is true there is a thing here
I do not understand.
There is a pain between my ears.
My son, to see you again causes my heart to soar Iike a hawk.
Sit here beside me.
Grandfather,
I brought you this present.
Is this the hat I used to own, except grown softer of skin and fatter?
No, grandfather, it's another.
We must smoke to your return.
I saw you in a dream.
You were drinking from a spring that came from the Iong nose of an animaI.
I did not recognise the animaI.
AIongside his nose, he grew two horns, and the water that gushed from his nose was fuII of air.
l can't explain it,
but he was talking
about that elephant-head spigot
in the soda shop,
This wasn't the only time Old Lodge
Skins had dreams that turned out true,
Don't be angry, my son, with
Burns Red, Shadow and the others.
They had many a bad experience with the white man Iast year.
I have thought and taIked and smoked on this matter, and my decision is...
LittIe Big Man has returned.
lt was quite a homecoming,
LittIe Big Man.
lt was Little Horse, the boy
who didn't want to fight the Pawnee,
Don't you remember me?
This hurts me in my heart.
I think I'II cry.
He'd become a heemaneh,
for which there ain't no English word,
And he was a good one, too,
The Human Beings
thought a lot of him,
- HeIIo, Younger Bear.
- Goodbye.
lt was the boy whose life l'd saved,
to his mortal embarrassment,
Did you catch the rabbits on your hunting trip?
No.
Then don't give them to BuffaIo WaIIow Woman.
You see, Younger Bear
had become a contrary,
the most dangerous
of all Cheyenne warriors
because the way they live
drives them half-crazy,
Except for battle, a contrary
does everything backwards,
He says ''goodbye'' for ''hello'',
''yes'' for ''no'',
walks through bushes
instead of on trails,
and washes with dirt
and dries with water,
I thought you were dead.
Why have you come back when nobody wants to see you?
You mustn't speak to LittIe Big Man
Iike that. You owe him a Iife.
I'm gIad I said it. HeIIo.
That was supposed to mean
he was sorry he said it, goodbye,
But that warrior wasn't sorry,
He hated me still,
Grandfather, I have a white wife.
You do?
That's interesting.
Does she cook and work hard?
Oh, yes, Grandfather.
That surprises me.
Does she show pIeasant enthusiasm when you mount her?
WeII, sure, Grandfather.
That surprises me even more.
I tried one of them once, but she didn't show any enthusiasm at aII.
WeII, Grandfather, aII the whites aren't crazy.
I'm gIad to hear that, my son.
- I thought they were.
- Oh, no.
I know of one who is as brave as any Human Being.
I'd Iike to meet this man and smoke with him.
What is he caIIed?
He's caIIed GeneraI Custer.
GeneraI Custer.
- What does the name mean, my son?
- WeII, it means...
- ...''Iong hair''.
- Good name. How did he win it?
He won it in the war of the whites to free the bIack men.
Oh, yes.
The bIack white men.
I know of them.
It is said a bIack white man once became a Human Being.
But mostIy, they are strange creatures.
Not as ugIy as the white, true, but they're just as crazy.
Don't worry, my son.
You'II return to the Human Beings.
I dreamed it Iast night.
I saw you and your wives as you crawIed from one to the other in your tepee.
- Wives, Grandfather?
- Oh, yes. Three or four.
It was dark, and they were hidden under buffaIo robes.
But it was a great copuIation, my son.
The Human Beings onIy take one wife.
How couId I have three or four?
I don't know. It worries me.
l was sure l'd never see him again,
Sir! I expect being a scout is the best way to find my wife, GeneraI.
She was captured when we went west, Iike you advised.
I advised? ImpossibIe.
I've never set eyes on you.
You wouIdn't remember me, sir.
Furthermore, you don't Iook
Iike a scout to me. Not a bit.
A scout has a certain appearance.
Kit Carson, for exampIe.
But you don't have it.
You Iook Iike...
- ...a muIe skinner.
- I know nothing about muIes.
I can teII the occupation of a man by Iooking at him.
Notice the bandy Iegs, the strong arms.
This man has spent years with muIes.
- Isn't that correct?
- WeII, I...
Yes, sir.
- Hire the muIe skinner!
- Yes, sir.
Over here! Come on!
I wouIdn't want my wife back from Indians.
Kindest thing, a buIIet in the brain.
WeII, I don't agree, and I want my wife back.
WeII, one of the Pawnee
Iocated a band of the vermin camped down the river.
We ride in the morning!
Is there any white women with them?
My advice to you is to get yourseIf a IittIe revenge on them bucks.
AII right. Spare the femaIes and chiIdren, if possibIe.
Let's go.
- (BARKING )
- (SCREAMING )
Hey! No!
Hey!
He said spare the women and chiIdren! Give me that!
- Let go of my rifIe.
- The heII I wiII!
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!
I'II kiII you.
lt was downright discouraging,
lf it wasn't lndians
trying to kill me for a white,
it was whites
trying to kill me for an lndian,
lt made me sick, Pawnee scouts
and soldiers was killing everything,
Aah!
Shadow! Brother, Iet's taIk.
Shadow...
I just took care of him.
I'm saving you for the hanging.
There is no describing how l felt,
An enemy had saved my life
by the violent murder
of one of my best friends,
The world was too ridiculous
even to bother to live in it,
That was why Shadow was there
and that was why he'd fought so hard,
l sat and watched that baby
come into this world,
Except for breathing,
that woman made no sound,
lf woman she was,
She didn't look more than a girl,
(BAB Y CRlES )
l couldn't take my eyes
off of that girl and her baby,
AII right, Iet's get the heII out.
Let the Pawnee cIean up.
Now, you Iisten to me.
If you are kin to Shadow, then you know of LittIe Big Man.
I was a friend of the Human Beings untiI they stoIe my wife.
Are you Shadow's wife?
His daughter?
Where's your husband?
KiIIed.
- What's your name?
- Sunshine.
I'm going to take you with me and trade you for my wife.
Near them bushes, Younger.
They're gone. Nobody here.
Let's get the heII out.
Wait here.
HeIIo, Grandfather.
Greetings, my son.
Do you want to eat?
Grandfather?
What happened to your neck?
It's a wound.
It cut the tunneI through which
Iight traveIs to the heart.
You're... You mean you're bIind?
Oh, no.
My eyes stiII see.
But my heart no Ionger receives it.
How did it happen?
White men.
- Where's BuffaIo WaIIow Woman?
- Rubbed out.
And White EIk Woman, too, and Dirt On The Nose, and High WoIf.
- And many others.
- And Burns Red?
Yes.
- Burns Red In The Sun?
- Rubbed out.
His wife, his chiIdren.
- And many more.
- Do you hate them?
Do you hate the white men now?
Do you see this fine thing?
Do you admire the humanity of it?
Because the Human Beings, my son, they beIieve everything is aIive.
Not onIy man and animaIs, but aIso water, earth, stone.
And aIso the things from them,
Iike that hair.
The man from whom this hair came, he's baId on the other side, because I now own his scaIp.
That is the way things are.
But the white men, they beIieve everything is dead: stone, earth, animaIs, and peopIe, even their own peopIe.
If things keep trying to Iive, white men wiII rub them out.
That is the difference.
You wiII stay with us, my son.
A year later, l was still with them,
After wandering all over
in constant danger of being killed
by white settlers or white soldiers,
we come to a place knowed
as the lndian Nations,
lt was a tract of land
by the Washita River
that had been give for ever
to the lndians
by the Congress and
the President of the United States,
We was safe there,
This was lndian land,,,
,,,as long as grass grow
and wind blow and the sky is blue,
Your new son's kicking a Iot today.
I think he wants to come out and see his father.
TeII him to wait untiI I finish my dinner.
I'II teII him, but I don't think he's going to wait much Ionger.
It's good I have a strong, brave husband who brings in so much food.
My strong husband brings in much more than we need.
There are many Human Beings here, many bands from many pIaces.
But it's sad. Many husbands have been rubbed out by the white man.
So women sIeep aIone and cry.
Be quiet now. I'm digesting.
Yes, but I think my sisters are here.
Your what?
My sisters. Digging Bear, LittIe EIk and Corn Woman. I think they're here.
What do you mean, you ''think'' they're here?
I beIieve they are. You bring in much more food than we need.
It is very sad. They have no husbands and they cry.
That's too bad. I'm sorry.
Digging Bear had a baby and Iost it, and so did Corn Woman.
- But LittIe EIk had no baby at aII.
- What do you want me to do about it?
I knew you'd understand.
lt was Old Lodge Skins' dream,
trying to come true,
l was determined
to stay out of them buffalo robes,
Three young and healthy women
with no man for who knows how long,
The very idea kind of shrunk me
like a spider on a hot stove,
Why, it's LittIe Big Man.
Oh, LittIe Big Man.
Younger Bear, it's LittIe Big Man.
He's not a contrary any more.
He has a wife.
She's pIump, she works hard, but she henpecks him.
Just when I think you're dead, you aIways come back.
Yes, and I aIways wiII, tiII you pay me the Iife you owe me.
I've heard you.
Now come to my tepee and eat.
We was caught
in Cheyenne hospitality,
I'm a very important man, more important than you.
I have a wife and four horses.
I have a horse and...
...four wives.
That may be, but my wife, she's a very good one.
See?
Oh, so there you are, you crawIing coyote.
What are we going to eat?
This starved duck?
Oh! Who's the beggar you brought to steaI what IittIe food we have?
CIean it! CIean it!
lt was Olga, l'd found her at last,
One duck.
Olga never did learn much English, but
she sure in hell had learned Cheyenne,
I just don't understand it.
UsuaIIy, this woman is gentIe as a dove.
My words were not the words to speak to a stranger. You stay and eat.
You see what a good wife she is?
It's because I'm a wonderfuI Iover.
Go in my tepee.
She wiII cook for you.
That's aII right. I'm not hungry.
You humiIiated him again.
Goodbye, Younger Bear.
You Iook tired, LittIe Big Man.
Do you want to come into my tepee and rest on soft furs?
Why don't you Iive with me and I'II be your wife?
Thank you for inviting me.
WeII, I've got to fix my hair to sing tonight.
Goodbye, LittIe Big Man.
Goodbye, LittIe Horse.
And so l finally found Olga,
But l had lost her long ago
to the Human Beings
and l saw no good reason
to reveal myself to her now,
Grandfather.
Why have you moved your tepee so far from our band?
The ponies are trying to teII me something.
Last night I had a dream.
The ponies were dying.
I heard them scream.
l'd learned to respect
Old Lodge Skins' dreams,
but for once we were in a safe place,
give to us by treaty,
Why do you hate my sisters?
I don't hate your sisters.
It's just that...
...the Great Spirit teIIs me...
Where are you going?
Your son won't wait any Ionger. He wants to come out and see his father.
Sunshine, lndian style,
was going off to have her baby,
As l watched her walk away,
it come over me that the Great Spirit
wanted me to go in that tepee,
Who wants to be first?
- Who is this here?
- It's me.
WeII, I guess you'II do as weII as any.
l figured she was the littlest one
and it would be easy,
But Lord help us,
them young girls is deadly,
However,
the Great Spirit was with me,
and l survived,
Only thing was, just as l was
about to drift off real peaceful,,,
No, you stay.
- Not yet.
- Maybe I can come back Iater.
ldle boasting, l assure you,
- Who's this here?
- It's me. Digging Bear.
Well, she wasn't called Digging Bear
for nothing, l can tell you that,
Stay here. Corn Woman's too tired.
She don't sound tired to me.
That's not her. That's LittIe EIk.
That's both of them.
LittIe EIk, you go to sIeep.
You too. Digging Bear...
Corn Woman, where are you?
l was lucky l come across her last,
The others, too?
Yes.
I knew you were a good man.
Here's your new son.
l reckon right then l come close
to turning pure lndian,
and l probably would have spent
the rest of my days
with Sunshine and her sisters,
- But sometimes grass don't grow,
- (WHINNYING )
wind don't blow
and the sky ain't blue,
Something's wrong with the ponies.
WoIves. Grandfather's...
Here. Go inside.
Don't Ieave the tepee.
- (WHINNYING )
- (RUMBLE OF HOOVES )
Grandfather, what's wrong with the ponies?
Don't you hear that, my son?
I wonder why I didn't see them in my dream.
Sunshine! Sunshine!
Grandfather, you've got to get inside.
Why bother, son?
It's a good day to die.
We've got to get to the river bank!
I am bIind. I cannot fight.
But I won't run.
If it's my day to die,
I want to do it here, within a circIe.
Grandfather, the river is part of the great circIe of the waters of the earth.
True, but the soIdiers wouId kiII us before we got to the river.
The soIdiers? Grandfather, you didn't see any soIdiers in your dream, and that means that they can't see you now.
- You think so?
- Yes! What eIse did your dream mean?
- I think you're right.
- Let's go to the circIe of the river!
I've never been invisibIe before.
- It's too Iate. We're cut off.
- It doesn't matter. We're invisibIe.
Grandfather, wait!
Grandfather!
lt sounds ridiculous, but the soldiers
never lifted a hand to stop us,
lt was so crazy,
they couldn't figure it out,
Maybe they thought
we was prisoners or friendlies,
since Old Lodge Skins
was grinning at them like a raccoon,
Or maybe we really was invisible,
All l knowed is we walked
right through them to the river,
CircIe the camp!
CircIe the camp, boys!
- That was extremeIy enjoyabIe.
- GIad you Iiked it, Grandfather.
Captain!
- Captain, shoot the Indian ponies.
- I beg your pardon, sir?
That is my decision.
Shoot the ponies.
- Sunshine.
- Yes, sir.
Young man, your seIf-righteous piety is commencing to annoy me.
- I didn't say anything.
- Shooting ponies shocks you?
Let me teII you, the women are more important than the ponies.
They breed Iike rats.
However, this is a IegaI action, and the men are under strict orders not to shoot the women.
UnIess, of course, they refuse to surrender.
- Isn't that correct?
- Yes, sir.
Sunshine!
Run! Run!
Run!
No! No!
- Where you going?
- Message for the GeneraI.
Wait a minute.
- What's that on your face?
- Mud, sir.
That's not mud. That's Indian paint.
And that's an Indian knife.
- What's your company?
- My company, sir?
Yes, and your commanding officer.
- What's the troubIe, Captain?
- We've got a renegade.
He's wearing Indian paint and he doesn't know his company.
- Take him away and hang him.
- GeneraI!
Don't you remember me?
I'm Jack Crabb, the muIe skinner!
- MuIe skinner?
- Yes. I appIied for a job as scout, but you couId teII my true occupation just by Iooking at me.
Yes, I beIieve I do remember that.
How did you become a renegade?
GeneraI, I ain't no renegade!
I was captured by the Cheyenne and heId prisoner!
Why, they took cactus thorns and stuck them in me!
But I just Iaughed and begged them to keep on doing it!
- You Iaughed?
- I Iaughed my head off.
Otherwise I wouIdn't be here.
GentIemen, it is difficuIt to admit to an error.
Captain.
Your summary judgement was whoIIy mistaken!
Aren't you gIad I questioned this man more cIoseIy?
Yes, sir.
PIease be more carefuI in the future, Captain.
- I'II drink the tea now, CorporaI.
- Yes, sir.
What are you doing up here, muIe skinner?
Nothing.
I just brought you tea, GeneraI.
And I...
...wanted to thank you again for sparing my Iife.
Why are you standing to the side?
Turn this way.
You came up here to kiII me, didn't you?
And you Iost your nerve.
WeII, I was correct in a sense.
You are a renegade, but you are no Cheyenne brave.
Custer was right,
l was a total failure as an lndian,
Do I hang you?
I think not. Get out of here.
- You're not going to hang me?
- Your miserabIe Iife is not worth a reversaI of a Custer decision.
That was the worst thing
he could have done to me,
There was nothing left
of my self-respect at all,
l couldn't go back to the lndians,
so l went back among the whites
and become a drunk,
Oh, you're a sad sight, Hoss.
You shouId have stuck to soda pop.
- How are things with you, BiII?
- Fine.
- I've changed my ways, Hoss.
- That's good.
Hey, BiII, I need a drink worse than the breath of Iife itseIf.
Here's $20. Get gIoriousIy drunk.
But first, go to the barber and have yourseIf a bath.
And buy some cIothes.
Then come see me in the saIoon.
One thing I do know, Hoss.
Any fooI can drink himseIf to death.
I'd Iike to ask you a confidentiaI favour.
It's a deIicate matter invoIving a widow.
She needs a train ticket out of town.
- You give her this.
- Sure, BiII.
You see, my new, beautifuI wife is vioIentIy jeaIous.
And this widow...
Oh, she's quite a widow.
- I think I know what you mean, BiII.
- Her name is LuIu Kane.
- Right now, BiII.
- Good.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
- BiII!
- He kiIIed my daddy!
He kiIIed my daddy! He ain't never going to shoot nobody again!
It took me seven years, but I got him!
- Who was he, anyhow?
- Some boy.
Hoss, you know that matter we discussed?
- The widow?
- Yes, BiII.
Don't teII my wife.
That'd reaIIy get me in troubIe.
You got me down in this goddamn water.
- (BELL)
- You quit it right now,
Come in, stranger.
Whatever it is you want, we've got it.
Mrs Pendrake?
You've mistaken me for someone eIse, stranger.
My name is LuIu.
Your name ain't LuIu.
You're Louise Pendrake.
- Who are you?
- Why, I'm Jack Crabb.
Mrs Pendrake, don't you remember me?
Jack Crabb?
My God.
Jack.
This is quite a pIeasant surprise.
This room is more commodious.
What have you been doing?
LuIu! What are you doing, sitting on your arse?
- A gentIeman is waiting.
- I have a gentIeman here, too.
Oh. I didn't see you, stranger.
Need anything?
If you do, just ring the beII.
Our motto here is: whatever you want, we've got it.
WeII, Jack. Now you know.
This is a house of iII fame, and I'm a faIIen fIower.
That widow hadn't lost her style
one bit,
A fallen flower,
Chokes me up to think about it,
This Iife is not onIy wicked and sinfuI.
It isn't even any fun.
No, I reckon not, Mrs Pendrake.
Yet, if I was married and couId come here once or twice a week, it might be fun.
But every night, it's just boring.
Oh, I can understand that.
I can't save any money.
If I couId just save a few doIIars,
I couId visit my maiden aunt in Washington.
I'd have cIothes, a carriage...
I might even marry a senator.
Oh! You'd make a good wife for a senator, Mrs Pendrake.
You aIways were a sweet boy.
Do you know, I often had wicked thoughts about you?
SeveraI times.
I aImost gave in to temptation.
And now, here we are.
Mrs Pendrake, what are you doing?
Do you know that, once,
I tiptoed into your room and stood over you for the Iongest time?
It was the most awfuI temptation to wake you up.
I wish that I had.
It wouId have been deIiciousIy wicked.
Is anything the matter, Jack?
- No.
- Then I'II wait for you in the...
...pIace of retirement.
You shouId have woke me up that night years ago, Mrs Pendrake.
This is from WiId BiII.
It was his Iast wish that you go and Iive with your maiden aunt.
His Iast wish was to save me?
Oh, Jack.
I must honour that wish.
You can do it, Mrs Pendrake.
Yes. I can, and I wiII.
I've got to go now.
Goodbye, Mrs Pendrake.
Oh, goodbye, Jack.
And thank you ever so much.
And, Jack...
If you're ever in Washington, do Iook me up.
- How are things, Mr Meriweather?
- SpIendid.
WeII, now, Iook at that.
BuffaIo hides.
There's a worId of money chewing grass on those pIains, Jack.
There goes BuffaIo BiII himseIf.
Yes, sir. MuItipIy that by thousands.
The buffaIo are getting scarce.
You were raised by Indians.
You shouId know how to track them.
We couId make a kiIIing, Jack.
- Haven't changed a bit, Jack.
- Neither have you.
You'd better watch out.
They're whittIing you down.
You can't afford to Iose any more of your parts.
Every business has a particIe of risk.
Bye, dear boy.
That was my low,
l had reached the bottom,
l become a hermit,
l went deep in the wilderness,
as far away as l could get,
Then one day, l found something
trappers see fairly regular,
An animal had gnawed off
its own foot to escape from a trap,
Something snapped in my head,
l decided life wasn't fit to live,
and the only thing to do was
to mingle with the twinkling stars,
Goodbye, Jack.
At that moment, l really was crazy,
and l was darn near off that cliff
when,,,
The time had come
to look the devil in the eye
and send him to hell
where he belonged,
The only question was
how to get him there,
Sergeant, take this man...
...and give him some cIothes.
This man wiII be invaIuabIe to me,
Major.
InvaIuabIe, sir?
I aImost hanged him as a renegade.
Now he asks to be a scout.
Oh, his game is very obvious: to Iead me away from his Indian friends.
WeII, I stiII don't quite foIIow you,
GeneraI.
Anything that man teIIs me wiII be a Iie.
Therefore, he wiII be a perfect reverse barometer.
- Isn't that correct?
- Of course, GeneraI.
ln my belief, Custer's hate
for the lndians and his ambition
had combined on him,
He figured he needed one more
dramatic victory over the lndians
to be nominated for
President of the United States,
That is a historical fact,
Men, hoId!
- We wiII take brief refreshment.
- Dismount!
Water break!
Oh, excuse me, Lieutenant.
It's the ceIibacy of the saddIe.
I had muscIe spasms aII night.
- Poison from the goonads.
- Poison from the what, sir?
Goonads. That's medicaI terminoIogy.
GeneraI, it's my duty as your...
The poison rises from the goonads and seeps down to the muscIes.
The Crows want to know if you're going down the Medicine TaiI CouIee.
- They do, do they?
- Yes, sir, they do.
They cIaim they want time to sing their death song.
TeII the Crows they're women.
But if the hostiIes come in behind us, and if they're waiting for us beIow, we'II never get out of there.
HostiIes behind us?
I see no hostiIes behind us.
Do you see any?
- No, sir, not at the moment.
- Then...
...stop trying to cause a reversaI of a Custer decision.
But, sir, wouIdn't it be best to send a squad down Medicine TaiI CouIee?
- No, it wouIdn't.
- May I ask, sir, why it wouIdn't?
Because it wouId cost us the vitaI eIement of surprise.
Surprise?
They know we're here.
But they don't know that
I intend to attack them without mercy.
- That's no surprise.
- Of course it is.
Nothing is more surprising than the attack without mercy.
GeneraI...
GeneraI, I must protest this impetuous decision.
A Custer decision, impetuous?
Grant caIIed me impetuous, too!
That drunkard, sitting there in the
White House, caIIing me impetuous!
GeneraI, I impIore you to reconsider.
Think of the men whose Iives depend upon you.
What shouId I do, muIe skinner?
Sir, that man doesn't know anything.
What do you say, muIe skinner?
ShouId I go down there, or withdraw?
l had him,
But this time what l held in my hand
wasn't a knife, but the truth,
WeII?
What's your answer, muIe skinner?
GeneraI, you go down there.
- You're saying, go into the couIee?
- Yes, sir.
There are no Indians there,
I suppose?
I didn't say that.
There are thousands of Indians down there, and when they get done with you, there won't be nothing Ieft but a greasy spot.
This ain't the Washita River, GeneraI, and them ain't heIpIess women and chiIdren waiting for you.
They're Cheyenne Brave, and Sioux.
You go down there if you got the nerve.
StiII trying to outsmart me, aren't you, muIe skinner?
You want me to think that you don't want me to go down there, but the subtIe truth is you reaIIy don't want me to go down there.
WeII, are you reassured now, Major?
Men of the Seventh!
The hour of victory is at hand!
Onward to LittIe Bighorn and gIory!
We've caught them napping!
Sound the charge!
We have them on the run!
Take no prisoners!
(BUGLE SOUNDS
ABOVE BATTLE NOISE)
Get off of your knees, men! Custer's with you! Custer's up! Stay with me!
What are they doing?
- Why aren't they charging?
- There's nowhere to charge to.
FooIs! They're shooting their own horses!
Arrest them! Arrest them!
- BugIer! Sound the charge!
- We've got to make breastworks!
I know aII about that, Major.
Don't try to teII me my business.
Make breastworks, men!
Show them no mercy!
I said, give them a voIIey!
- We're running out of ammunition.
- Right.
Now we are running out of ammunition.
I toId him this wouId happen.
But he just sat there in the White House and Iaughed at me.
That damned Cossack.
This is horribIe.
We're being wiped out!
Go on, Christian America!
Let your arrows fIy, savages!
I am unbowed!
Mr President!
Mr President, distinguished visitors, honoured members of the Senate, taking the Indian as we find him, waiting...
Why don't you shut up?
Mr President, you are drunk.
We can't have a man Iike you in the White House!
Get on your feet and face the enemy!
- Go away, GeneraI.
- AII right.
The sentence is death.
AII right. You and I are even at Iast.
I paid you the Iife I owe you, and, the next time we meet, I can kiII you without becoming an eviI person.
He goes to dance his joy.
Grandfather.
I am gIad to see you.
I'm gIad to see you, too, my son.
My heart soars Iike a hawk.
Do you want to eat?
I won't eat with you because I'm going to die soon.
Die, Grandfather?
Yes, my son.
I want to die in my own Iand, where
Human Beings are buried in the sky.
Why do you want to die, Grandfather?
Because there's no other way to deaI with the white man, my son.
Whatever eIse you can say about them, it must be admitted, you cannot get rid of them.
No, I suppose not, Grandfather.
There is an endIess suppIy of white men, but there aIways has been a Iimited number of Human Beings.
We won today.
We won't win tomorrow.
Snake Woman, get me my eIk buriaI robe.
Come, my son. We wiII go.
It makes my heart sad.
A worId without Human Beings has no centre to it.
Go where, Grandfather?
To the mountain, to the top.
Come out and fight.
It is a good day to die.
Thank you for making me a Human Being.
Thank you for heIping me to become a warrior.
Thank you for my victories and for my defeats.
Thank you for my vision and the bIindness in which I saw further.
You make aII things and direct them in their ways, O Grandfather.
And now, you have decided the
Human Beings wiII soon waIk a road...
...that Ieads nowhere.
I am going to die now, unIess death wants to fight.
And I ask you for the Iast time to grant me my oId power to make things happen.
Take care of my son here.
See that he doesn't go crazy.
(RAINDROPS FALL
ON OLD LODGE SKINS )
Grandfather?
Am I stiII in this worId?
Yes, Grandfather.
I was afraid of that.
WeII...
...sometimes the magic works, sometimes it doesn't.
Let's go back to the tepee and eat, my son.
My newest Snake wife cooks dog very weII.
AII right, Grandfather.
She aIso has a very soft skin.
The onIy troubIe with Snake women is they copuIate with horses, which makes them strange to me.
She says she doesn't. That's why
I caII her Doesn't Like Horses.
But, of course, she's Iying.
Of course, Grandfather.
Well, that's the story
of this old lndian fighter,
That's the story of the Human Beings,
who was promised land
where they could live in peace,
Land that would be theirs
as long as grass grow,
wind blow,
and the sky is blue,
Mr Crabb, l didn't know,
Get out, get out.

There ain't.
Come on... ho!
Hyah, cattle!
Hey-yah! Hyah!
Go on, y'all!
You're sure right about this place, frank.
I ain't never seen such a pretty place. door was open.
Helped myself.
Always did have the best water in the basin.
Saw the old clock was gone.
Suppose you sold it like you did that land to them soldier boys.
Ain't ya done enough to spite me?
Down to the two of us now.
Just us.
You should've married me.
We'd have had a child.
Be heir to it all... the whole basin.
Ain't too late.
I gotta hand it to you... you hung on longer than anybody else.
You put up a hell of a fight... but it don't take no genius to see... it's your last year.
I don't wanna have to ruin you, ella.
Jacob, you mind some company?
I've got a call in to claire.
Did you see this?
I think the russians are gonna beat us into berlin.
Neil, by fall, i'll have the connors place.
Do you really think ella's gonna go under?
You can bet on it.
Why don't you come back east with me for a couple of weeks?
We'll go down to the place in virginia and do some fishing.
I wish your father had lived to see this basin back together again.
I could never have rebuilt it without his help.
Well, my father... was a very generous man.
Cattle will cover this basin the way buffalo did in my grandfather's time.
Sounds like that might take a good deal of capital.
This is not a very good time to talk about it, but sometime soon, i'd like to sit down with you and talk about the mineral rights to this valley.
Oil and cattle are not incompatible.
This is heartland... cattle country... and that's the way it's going to stay.
That's probably claire.
I'll get it.
Hello?
Yes, i did.
Hi, claire.
I know it's late in new york.
I'm sorry to wake you, but i wanted you to know where things stand.
Who's that benefitting?

Oh, no.
Billy, my partner.
Billy... billy... i never should've sold you that land.
But i had no choice.
Please... please, tell me who did this.
Name's ewing.
You sit up, you can have that food.
I ain't gonna help you.
The more it hurts, the quicker you're gonna get well and get outta here.
I ain't set up to be no hospital.
I left you some food in that box over there.
It's mostly cans and dried stuff, but you'll get by.
As soon as you're fit, you're gonna be movin' on.
You ought to know, old man... this season's gonna hold the worst work we ever done.
It's gonna be worse than last year.
You're free to pack it in anytime you want.
Baby sister, each year i get a little less primed.
I can still do my work.
You ought to know that.
They're sayin' it's my last year, dodger.
They're sayin' i'm gonna go under before fall.
Aw, they said that before... if i remember right.
It's different.
The bank isn't gonna let me just pay on the interest this year.
We're gonna need beeves comin' to over $12,000 by august.
Hell, we didn't do
$4,000 last year.
Well, we come close.
With all them broken bones of yours?
Well, there was a few accidents.
You had some, too.
You're a year older.
You're brittler.
And your cows is older and tougher.
Hell, you got cattle ain't never seen flat land.
You might as well be ranchin' a bunch of mountain goats.
Hell, that'll ride him.
You know, that deep water don't hurt, but that idea of bein' drug off the cliff will kind of get ya.
You can say no.
Hell no.
I made my choice.
Well, we got us
1 old man... and a banshee woman boss.
Heh heh... feel like a fart in a windstorm.
Giddup!
Yah! Yah! Yah!
Goddamn!
Well, we lost 'em.
Flushin' cows out of this timber is like tryin' to teach an elephant to use a typewriter.
Howdy.
Hear a terrible thing happened to you.
I think i got the, uh, man that did the shootin'.
Oh, you did.
He's dead.
Did you get the man that sent him?
You better get that son of a bitch before i do.
His name... is ewing.
Then tell him that.
He's the law.
The man you killed worked for me.
I'm ewing.
Sorry your pard's dead.
Sorry all this had to happen, but sometimes, things just work out that way.
Now, we are disposed to give you the benefit of the doubt when it comes to murder.
You take that and head someplace where you got a chance.
Ooh... oh, now, baby.
There... oh... there you go.
Oh, yeah.
What's the matter with her?
Her mama's dead.
She get to nurse any?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
If it didn't, uh... i don't imagine you're gonna do her any good.
Nobody asked you.
Yeah... that a girl.
You gonna be all right.
Yeah.
Please don't watch me.
There you go...
I'll do it.
Since you're full able to get around and fix a meal and all... figure you might as well just get goin'.
Here, i'll do it.
Told you i wasn't runnin' no hospital.
This ain't a hotel either.
Just thought i'd give you a little hand.
I don't need a maid, don't need a cook.
You can get that kind of work in town.
I gotta go in tomorrow anyway. I'll give you a lift.
Here... made ya these.
I don't need no chaps.
Hell, lady, they sure as hell ain't gonna fit me.
It's a wonder you got any flesh on them legs at all with them skunk skins you been wearing.
Uh... i need... i need me a horse.
Think i could buy one?
It'll cost you.
Yes, ma'am.
I did say i'd buy one.
I don't think there's nothin' i want from you for nothin'.
Here you go.
You should've chose a gentler horse.
You're too sto-stove up for parsons.
He'll break you just taking you to town.
Don't want you to fall off here and sue me.
I'll take the risk.
I meant what i said about taking you to town.
Thank you.
I ain't going to town.
You ain't goin' back to that toilet you call a cabin, are you?
Yes, ma'am.
Excuse me.
It seems to me a person in your situation might use an able-bodied man.
Thank you.
I guess i could use a hired hand.
Sorry, i ain't no hired hand.
I'll work with you, but i sure as hell can't work for you.
You do owe me.
You owe me for the care and the time you spent at my place.
Excuse me?
I said, you do owe me.
You know, lady, you got balls the size of grapefruits.
All right.
I'll work for you a season.
You pay me any way you can at the end.
Except some of it's gotta be in stock.
Of course, any of mine we find, you help me trap 'em.
It's a deal. whoa. Whoa. why don't you come on in?
I thought you might want something to eat.
Thank you very much.
There's no need to thank me.
I guess i lost my head.
Excuse me... could i use your sink here?
Help yourself.
You're working too hard.
You're gonna get yourself tore up.
You're not gonna be fit to work.
A few more days ain't gonna hurt me, but you get yourself stove up, you might as well pack it in.
Get yourself another boss,
'cause i don't need no cripple.
The towel's under your hat.
I aim to get this drive done.
It's gonna be a long hard pull.
You're gonna have to be fit.
Yep. Imagine i can handle it.
I don't count on miracles.
Don't mind me. I'm... i always eat this way.
Uh, do you mind if i do the same thing?
Suit yourself.
Excuse me.
Tragedies of shakespeare.
Oh, i'm sorry.
I didn't know.
I'm sorry.
It's my bills.
That's where i keep my bills.
Appropriate, ain't it?
That paint horse is gonna... he's gonna make a nice calf horse.
Mmm.
Nice house.
I noticed, uh, the edge of your clean spot... uh, clean spot on that wall over there.
Mmm.
Used to be a clock.
My great-granddad gave it to my mom and dad for their wedding.
Like him, it was a noisy old thing.
Couldn't get a moment's peace.
Well, it sure is peaceful now.
Hyah!
Come on!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Yaah!
I got the rest of them corralled up near the high mesa.
And them broncs of yours is the smartest i ever seen.
Took me 3 days, but i got 'em all gathered.
Hello, buck.
You got some damn fine horses for this madness of yours, ella.
Got enough?
I wouldn't be here if we didn't.
Enough if he works with us?
You think you're up to this?
The way he talks, he better be.
Well, you... you look all right.
I just hope you don't go bad on us when we need you the most.
I try not to make a habit of going bad on folks, ol' fella.
My name's dodger, if you don't mind.
You got a place of your own.
Why'd you want to throw in with us?
How'd you get so old being so damn nosy?
Eh, luck and brains, i guess.
You gonna answer the question?
You gonna give me a chew?
Well, you... you sure picked a lulu.
Thank you.
Just don't take it all.
I think i got you figured.
Let's get the gear.
All right. hyah! hey! my pal is an honest young puncher honest and upright and true but he turned to a hard-shootin' gunman on account of a gal named lou he mixed in with evil compan...
Damn, buck... i've had this thing in hock so much,
The pawnbroker plays it better than i do.
I wish that son of a bitch was here.
You ever been married, buck?
I don't imagine i ever been that drunk. You?
No.
I went with an old gal for quite a while.
We's layin' in bed one morning, and suddenly she sprung it on me.
She said, "dodger...
"don't you think it's about time we was gettin' hitched?"
And i says...
"well, do you suppose anybody'd have us?" ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha! they'll stay by a man while he's winning and laugh in his face at his fall hyah! ewing's moving his cattle on your land.
He's gonna try to cross.
I believe you're on my land.
Take them around the long way, we lose maybe
2 to 4 pounds apiece.
This is the best way.
Don't mean a damn to me.
I'll pay passage fees.
Imagine you will.
You let him cross here, he's gonna walk all over you.
This is a legal challenge.
I know what i'm talking about.
He tried to do this to my dad.
You let me tend to my business.
How many head you bringing?
Thousand.
He's pissing on you, athearn.
Look like you're halfway through now.
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Athearn!
Thanks.
Appreciate your helping out back there.
Think about working with me, frank, not against me.
The only thing i want you to appreciate... is i never want to see you or your cattle on my land again.
Do you understand that?
Do you understand it? hello, buck.
I'll be back for my things.
Well, what happened?
He was letting ewing run his cattle across his land.
Yeah?
I stampeded ewing's cattle.
J.w. Couldn't have split you two up any more if he'd have used a broadax on you.
Can't trust athearn.
Yeah, he's kinda sneaky, all right.
Always talking up like he does... and having common sense.
It's real bad business.
Sure did... gather them cows in a hurry, didn't you?
Oh, yeah. We're... we're just hell on wheels, as you probably know.
You still looking for that dog to kick?
Damn. You know, you're... you're the one to jump in when you don't know the right direction.
But, you know, you gotta go back quite a ways to... make this all fit in.
Guess i'm gonna have to hear this.
Well, just the important part.
That... that's all that matters.
So... well, j.w. Ewing and tom connors, they was... they was raised like brothers instead of cousins.
Tom never would give in to j.w.
He wouldn't budge
1 inch on the land, and he raised ella as a fighter.
He tried to make her the son that he needed, but he never did have.
She was weaned on war.
She never knew nothin' else.
They got a word down in texas... stargazer.
That's an ol' horse that's had his bit jerked on real hard whenever he'd slow up or look down at the ground.
So, to get away from that, he'd hold his head up and always kinda lookin' at the sky.
And that's ella.
Somethin' i can do for you?
This here is ralph cole.
Ewing has him around the place to keep them windmills a-going with that hot air of his, i think.
I'd sure like to know why he's on the prowl.
Emil kroegh was my buddy.
Ahh.
You know, i understand why they keep this ol' windbag around.
The only thing he's good for is mending fences or sugar tootin'.
But i heard you were a real cowman.
Shit, you ain't nothin' but a paper bat who couldn't lick his upper lip.
Well, any horse's ass that'd work for a woman... he don't deserve nothin' better than road-apple pie.
I guess we know how ella's paying you off.
Yeah.
Oh!
Unh! drink your beer, dodger.
Yaah!
Unh! Unh!
I'm so sorry, fellas.
Unh!
He'll cover it.
I say you oughtn't have done that!
Unh!
Look... you tell your boss to stay clear of me.
Go on!
God!
Ah!
Didn't want you sneaking back for your damn cattle.
Well, i'm obliged.
Where'd you find 'em?
It ain't so hard if you know where to look.
How you doin'?
Fine.
Could offer you a little water if you like.
We hid your cattle on you.
Figured it'd stretch more work outta you.
Doesn't much matter.
Yes, it does.
Ain't never cheated a man in my life.
Even had you stayed, we would have given them back to you.
It's all right, and how about the water?
No.
I'm not gonna consider it a debt if you take a mouthful of water, you understand?
Woman, what in the hell is the matter with you?
Well, what the hell's that supposed to mean?
It means what in the hell's the matter with you?
Why don't you just come and say what you got to say instead of that nonsense about these cattle?
You and the old man can't make it alone... so you need me.
Well, i figure i need you, too.
Imagine i could make this work here for a year, but then i'd have to pack it in, and i figure... figure you do, too.
Sure like to figure, don't you?
Yes, ma'am.
It, uh, it helps.
Look, i don't want to take over your ranch, you understand, but i, uh... i'm not coming back as a hired hand.
I ain't never had no partner.
Well, it's not real hard to figure out why.
For the season.
I guess i'll see you in the morning.
There's, uh... one more little thing.
I sure hate the way you say my name "athearn."
I hate it. "athearn."
Sounds like you're sneezing.
So, uh, i thought maybe we could call each other by our first names... frank and ella.
How's that sound?
All right.
Ma'am?
All right.
All right, what?
All right... frank.
Jesus.
There you go.
See you in the morning.
Hyah!
Hyah! Hep! Hep!
Hyah! Hup!
Hup! Hup! Hup!
Hyah! Hup! Hup!
This what this is for?
No, by god.
Mornin', ella.
Can you spare a minute?
Come in.
This here's virge hoverton, the banker, frank.
Guess you know about frank athearn.
Good morning, miss connors, athearn.
Pleasure to meet you, mr. Athearn.
This is neil atkinson.
I'm sure you've heard of atko oil.
Uh, and this is, uh, george bascomb, his geologist.
Heard you've been doin' pretty good.
Still got a ways to go though, huh?
I don't guess you come up here to talk about that.
You got somethin' to say, why don't you just say it?
You know, miss connors, the characteristics of this valley are almost identical to what we found in other parts of this state where there are already substantial oil fields in production.
Why, there could be a lot of wealth in here.
Unfortunately, we can't really pinpoint the exact location of that structure without a more complete seismic record.
What he means, ella, is they want to test for oil.
I'm not stupid, virge.
I also ain't interested.
You ought to know that by now.
Well, i understand that.
But have you given any thought to what this means?
Uh, hell.
Hell, i imagine it means you gonna tear the earth apart.
You know, ella, i admire you.
I've watched you and your father give everything you had to this piece of land.
Now is your chance to make it pay.
I seen places where they drill for oil.
You better include my partner over there in these dealings.
He's got a mind of his own.
It's not just a question of a piece of land or an oil company.
The war is going to be over soon, and we're going to have a lot of building to do. We're going to need more energy than we've ever needed before.
When it comes to the land over the needs of the people, i think i'd have to take people anytime.
Boy, it sounds to me like a bunch of speeches i heard when they was tryin' to get me to re-enlist in the army.
They sure don't seem to have done a hell of a lot of good, do they?
I'm with the lady.
You got your answer, virge.
You know, ella... you could lose this place overnight.
Miss connors, i think i know how you feel.
I've dealt with a lot of ranchers who feel the same way you both do about the land.
Think it over.
And good luck with your roundup.
Be seein' you, virge.
Hyah! Hyah!
You know, i've been thinkin'.
Imagine there could be somethin' to what that atkinson said, you know?
What are you talkin' about?
Well, i mean, if you was to agree... and they was to find oil, you'd have enough money, you'd be set for life.
Then you'd be shed of ewing's and me.
All them things that bother you so much.
Now, see, you don't always look at both sides of things.
Ain't about to start now.
Guess you're not.
But i thought with all that oil money, hell, you could buy you a nice house in the city.
Be a real fine lady.
Real fine lady.
Drink champagne, and eat that there, uh, caviar.
Drink tea, you know, with your pinky up in the air.
Wear them nice little, uh, silk dresses with them flowers all over it.
Ain't that a pretty picture?
Uh, yes, ma'am, think it is.
I knew she'd never let you oil people piss on that land, even if it meant losin' it to me.
I don't think she's going to lose it to you, jacob.
Virgil tells me she and athearn are rounding up enough cattle to see them through another year.
Ella and that young cowboy make quite a team.
I admire you, jacob.
My father always said you were one of the last of the great empire builders.
Your father understood.
My father was a rich man's son who played with money.
But i'm not him.
Of all the money my father lent you, you've never paid back a cent.
I'm not asking you for the money you owe my family, but i want to test for oil on this land.
And when my people have had a chance to study the findings, we'll talk again.
And what if i don't go along with you?
I know how much this ranch means to you, jacob.
I'd hate to see you lose it.
Uhh.
Lemme get my air.
Uhh.
Frank!
Ohh.
I just gotta get my air.
Get the truck.
Damned air.
Doc says your limbs are gonna be fine, old man.
Gonna have to stay put for a while.
Hell, i ain't that sick.
Besides, we still got a hell of a lot of work to do. we got us a bunch.
Man's tryin' to tell you he's, uh, straight as a skeeter's peter in the middle of matin' season.
I been watchin' you pretty close, buck.
And i can tell you was taught by old joe voss.
He's as good a cowboy as i ever met.
I figure you could cut his trail any old day.
I never had his seam squirrels.
Always figured that's what made him so fast.
He was the most cootie-laden critter god ever put hair on.
But he was a cowboy.
I imagine.
Are you gonna give me a chew, buck?
Well, hell, you bet.
All i got here is this, uh, copenhagen.
Well, that's... that's good enough.
Yeah, i thought it might be.
You save me a pinch now.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go tend to the horses.
Ella?
You ought to know better than anyone, i won't allow no lyin' under my roof... except some of my old tall tales.
But i know and you know... my ropin' and ridin' days is over.
Who's top dog, baby sister?
The one that bites the hardest.
No matter what you think, your dad would be damn proud of you.
Whoa, son.
Whoa.
My garden's dyin'.
Oh, just needs a little waterin'.
Windmill broke.
It's just an old machine.
God damn you, ewing!
God damn your soul!
I imagine, uh, we got us a big enough herd right now.
No sense gettin' hoggish about the... about the whole thing here, especially with the weather gettin' as bad as it is.
It kind of spooks me.
We, uh... we turned out them good bulls... and some nice heifers.
You have you a nice start for next year.
I guess what i'm sayin' is, uh, we could, uh... just go with what we got, you know?
What do you think?
I slept with ewing.
I slept with ewing when i was a girl.
He was always watchin' me.
I was forbid to go near him, but he was always watchin' me, and... i'd come home from school, or i'd be out workin' the herd, out by myself somewhere.
He'd be there just lookin' at me and waitin'.
Never said nothin', just... just watchin' me and waitin'.
Then he had me.
My dad won a law case against him over the land.
One night, me and dodger and my dad were eatin' supper, and he rode up yellin' for my dad to come outside.
I stood right next to my dad on the porch.
Ewing told him every damn thing we did.
My dad looked at me to tell him it wasn't true, and i couldn't do it.
It just broke him.
Just broke him.
I hate him.
You know, it's gonna be, uh... nearly impossible for the two of us to drive that herd down the hill.
So i was thinkin', uh, well, we ought to hire us some... some hands to help us get them from here down to the ranch and then from, uh, you know, from the ranch to, uh, wherever the hell it is we're gonna sell them.
I was just, uh, thinkin' i ought to go in town and hire us on someone to help.
Thought maybe i'd go tomorrow.
What do you think?
Hmm?
Yeah.
How was your trip?
A little rough.
There was some turbulence in the mountains.
Mr. Ewing, these are all records of the seismic shooting we've done on your ranch.
We've completely covered your land all the way to ella connors' property line.
The only place where it would be economically feasible for us to drill a test would be somewhere in here.
Now, that's right on the connors' ranch, and she's not going to let us drill there.
But there's another possibility.
We could drill diagonally under her land, from the edge of the creek at this point on your property.
Now, we wouldn't have to put any hardware at all on her land.
It would probably be easy to get her permission.
Thank you, george.
You can leave the reports here.
Thank you.
Now what are you gonna do?
Wait her out... and hope, like you do, that she'll go under.
But that could take quite a while.
Yeah, it could.
In the meantime... what do i do to protect my interests from you?
If you could stop me, you would.
The only way to protect myself is to have the ewing ranch in my name.
I've gone over the whole situation.
With whom?
With hoverton, with the bank.
You talked to hoverton about taking over my ranch?
Well, you don't own the bank, jacob.
There was a time.
I'll make it as easy as i can for you.
We'll behave as if you were still the owner of the ranch.
If you were in my position, and you thought there was a chance for oil in this valley, wouldn't you protect yourself by taking it over?
If you were me, what would you do?
I'd squeeze so hard your nuts would fall off.
Hey, neil, you don't have to leave.
Might as well make yourself at home.
Hell, the house is as good as yours now.
Tell me, neil... when you retire me... you gonna give me a gold watch?
J.w.
Sit down, boys.
I understand ella and that soldier boy have rounded up enough cattle to hang on for another year.
You hadn't ought to worry about that, j.w.
Just because they've got them pinned... sure don't mean that they're gonna stay pinned.
They could be stopped... real easy.
Ever since there's been ewings, there's been blockers and coles at their side... through everything.
Nesters, rustlers, all our enemies.
When i was a boy, i saw a bulldog take a bull by the nose and wrestle him to the ground.
The dog bit too hard, and the bull stomped that dog to death.
Well, boys... we got a whole pack of dogs to deal with.
Hyah, hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah-ah!
Yah, yah, yah!
Hiya!
slide, then go home
ease, stamp, and right
Imagine you'd like to try one of them?
You think you might like to take your jacket off?
Now let's do the texas star.
bow to your partner
then bow to your corner
now swing your partner, to the left, whirl
then spin i think i better get started.
I want to get over those hills before it gets dark.
Julie, uh, pack up some chow for mr. Atkinson.
It's all taken care of, j.w.
Good.
Julie... i think you ought to know we'll both be workin' for mr. Atkinson from now on.
Is that a fact?
I surely do appreciate your not sayin' anythin' to anyone about takin' over, neil.
You'll see, jacob.
Everything is gonna work out just fine.
into the center, let's hear you yell
Yo!
now break, inside your partner's arms
ah, and left, your partner
now right...
Good stock, but a bit old, i suspect a mite on the tough side.
Won't find better beef, and you know it.
You should've sold them a long time ago.
We talkin' "should have's" and "what if's", or we talkin' cattle?
I don't imagine you'll need a pencil to give us a price or nothin'.
Like to make things official.
You call that a price?
I do.
You only have about 40 good head in that whole herd.
Most of those cow's heads are sore from bein' tied to the trees.
Army ain't buyin' anymore.
Everybody knows the war is comin' to an end.
I think 5 cents is a good price.
Well, i think, uh... there will be other buyers.
How about
51/2 cents?
How about... us thanking you for your time?
I know it's been a long trip.
We appreciate it.
Now we'll just say goodbye.
6 cents, and we do business.
I'm only doin' that now because i've known ella so long.
That include delivery, or we gotta bring them in?
No.
You deliver.
No, uh...
We deliver... i imagine we'd need another, uh, another penny.
Uh, we're doin' the work and all and, uh, weight loss.
Got to get another penny.
She was tough in the old days... but the two of you's just plumb awful.
Ok, 7 cents... and that's as high as i'm gonna go, now.
Is that a deal?
Deal.
All right.
Congratulations.
You're sure gettin' this place back on its feet again.
Yeah.
I'll see you in town with them, then, and don't be waterin' them just before you get to town to add a little extra weight.
So long, ellie.
So long, cliff.
Sit down, virgil.
Thanks, j.w.
That was sad about neil.
Yes, it is.
I understand, uh... you're goin' over to ella's later on, to pick up payment on her note.
Well, yes, i am.
Gonna celebrate?
Like you and neil did when you talked about takin' me over?
Oh, now, j. W... wasn't anything like that at all.
I had no choice in the matter.
Oh, i figure you did, virgil.
J.w., i have to tell you i have neil's instructions regarding the ranch.
Oh?
Neil left instructions... to you?
Well, yes.
I have to put the takeover in the works, but you don't have to worry, j.w.
He left specific instructions that you were to still run the ranch at a good salary.
The ranch will still bear the ewing name.
You're going to be well taken care of, j.w.
I hate to be the one to do this... but you have to look at it from my position, j.w.
You see, my first responsibility is to the bank.
You talkin' to me about the bank?
My grandpa built that bank.
Well, i know that, j.w.
Well, you might, since you was the one who come whinin' to us for money when the bank was failin' in '29.
We never failed you, virgil.
Trusted you.
You sold us out.
Guess i gotta rank you with a dog, virgil.
Sit down.
Big day for you, ain't it?
Cattle to market... debts about to be paid... new man in your life.
You best get out of here, j.w.
I never wanted it to happen this way, but you left me no choice.
I'm gonna give you one more chance.
You don't give nothin'.
You want my land, you're gonna have to kill me.
That's the way it's always been for you.
One of us had to kill the other.
No.
I just wanted to be left in peace to work my land.
Whatever happens now, you brought it on yourself.
You're not gonna get away with it, you know that.
Hoverton's on his way out here.
Hey.
Cut the rope on my hands.
(stage coach driver) 'Andale caballo'
'Andale caballo'
'Señor'
'Señor'
'Señor'
- Tighten up that girth.
- Señor I must go to San Felipe.
My mother is dead!
Straight down the road about 50 miles.
Yeah get outta here.
Hey. Hey amigo
Come here.
Perfect.
You're perfect!
I swear to God boys he's just right.
I'm gonna put you on that stage and watch those faces when they see you come in! v ovo
- By God I...
- Never mind dear.
Over there.
Not that door the other one there.
Pull. Pull.
There you are. Now just sit down and be quiet like a good little boy.
You see? He does understand.
Who knows perhaps he can even talk.
Now now even the peasants...
A bit of mustard?
Thank you.
Even the peasants are entitled to their rights.
After all they have won a revolution.
Or at least almost.
Animals that's what they are. Animals.
Even animals can be tame and harmless.
Personally I consider them unfortunate brutes.
Yes brutes. Quite right.
Precisely my dear lady precisely.
I hate saying it but you should hear them in the confessional.
- You would never imagine. Did you know...?
- I can imagine Father.
I can imagine.
Living in such promiscuity all of them in one room male and female together lying in a heap like rats in a sewer.
At night when the lights are out all their inibitions disappear.
You never know who is next: mother sister daughter... goat.
Every country has its own plague.
- Just like them niggers we got back home.
- Just like animals. That's what they are.
Exactly. Which is why they're half-wits.
Hey you. Do you know who your father was?
Do you know how old you are?
He doesn't know.
Do you know how many kids you have? Huh?
Do you know how many kids your mother had?
He doesn't know anything.
It was to benefit scum like this that the Agrarian Reform was imposed.
And that ass Madero wanted to give the government and our land to idiots like this.
We are all pawns in the hands of Almighty God.
Fortunately Divine Providence has disposed of that rash individual Madero.
My dear Monsignor let us be realistic.
What you call Providence I call General Huerta.
He put the peasants in their place.
Which is the best place for animals because that's what they are.
Animals.
(voices echo) I can imagine.
- I can imagine living in such promiscuity...
...wanted to give the government and our land to idiots like this!
- Goats.
- Animals.
- Rats!
- Just like them niggers we got back home.
- Half-wits!
- Animals!
Divine Providence has disposed...
Just like them niggers.
Animals. Because that's what they are. Animals.
...like them niggers.
- Brutes!
That's what they are animals.
- Like them niggers.
- Brutes!
Animals!
- I consider them unfortunate brutes.
- I can imagine...
Niggers.
- Brutes!
- Niggers!
...like them niggers.
- Idiots!
- Niggers!
- Idiots!
...like them niggers.
- Idiots! Half-wits!
(driver) 'Anda caballo anda'
(driver) 'Anda caballo'
Hey you give us a hand and push.
Think they'd get off their asses to help us the bastards? Hell no!
'Anda' 'Caballo huyo'
Haaaahh!
Take him away before he dirties everything.
Now ladies and gentlemen you will give everything to my niños without any trouble.
- We kill them all OK Papá?
- (gunshot)
I've told you Chulo no shooting unless Papá pulls the trigger.
Come.
Come come come come!
You wanted to know my family? That's my sons.
Each one of them from a different mother.
And now you kneel.
Kneel!
Kneel!
'Papá'
This is my father. I think.
- Pleased to meet...
- Go inside before Chulo kills everyone.
My mother had the blood of the Aztecs which was before your people.
And now I ask you a question.
Can you make a baby?
Can you make a baby?
That's sad. But we will fix that.
'Señora'
(Adelita) Let me go! Let go.
Go on.
Go.
- Go... go... go... go... go!
- (Adelita screams)
Pretty good huh?
Oh Jesus help me I'm going to faint.
No no no no no.
You faint now and you miss the best part.
Juanito you get everything?
You'll pay for this you bastard!
- I'm a citizen of the United States of America!
- You're an American son of a bitch.
Understand Yankee?
Thank you.
Thank you. For everything.
Have you a light?
There is a hole in the roof.
Hey!
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Why?
You pull that trigger and shoot me I fall.
And if I fall they'll have to alter all the maps.
You see when I go half this bloody country goes with me.
Including yourself.
- You understand now?
- Ah sí sí sí sí sí sí I understand.
'Sí
It's like a miracle of God.
You you are a great magician.
I stop your motorcycle you do the magic with my coach. We are even.
- Even?
- Sí
To fix my motorcycle would be even.
I'll be inside.
Oh! We kill him now Papá?
No. First we fix the motorcycle. Shh!
- It's whisky.
- Thank God for that huh?
Where are you going in this contraption?
Well... Where are you going?
- Shaver Mines.
- Oh-ho.
Lucanina huh? I know that place.
I know the man who owns it that fat German son of a bitch!
That crazy tub of lard Mr Aschenbach who wrings our people dry like slaves even his personal servants.
One girl had an ass: her cheek s were hard like drums.
I got her pregnant and he...
Oh Jesus Christ!
Will you shut up and go and fix my motorcycle?
OK.
OK.
Anything you say Firecracker.
(Juan) Take your hands off that. Now!
Well good for you Firecracker.
I don't know why I named you Napoleon when you have no imagination. This is a bank!
- Mesa Verde
- Sí Papá Mesa Verde. Mesa Verde.
If we can get this Firecracker to come with us we will be rich.
Where does he come in?
The dynamite's right here.
No no. You need an expert for that.
You only need matches and balls.
And I got those.
- ¿ Sí?
- 'Sí
See that tree over there?
Short fuse.
Now you understand why we need the firecracker?
Huh?
- Where the hell are we?
- What kind of work you do for the German?
Listen I asked you a question.
What do you do for the German?
- I've been looking for silver for him.
- Silver?
You know something? I don't understand you.
Why do you waste your time and your holy water looking for silver? To me that's a sin.
- Have you any better ideas?
- Sí Gold is better than silver.
There isn't any gold in these hills.
(laughs) Yes there is.
In Mesa Verde.
Of course.
Whoever heard of having a bank in the country!
Uh-huh. A bank?
Not a bank. The bank.
The most beautiful wonderful fantastic gorgeous magnificent bank in the world.
When you stand before the bank and you see it has the gates of gold like it was the gates of heaven.
And when you go inside everything everything is gold.
Gold spittoons gold handles. And money.
I know 'cause I saw when I was eight years old. I went there with my father.
He tried to rob the bank. They caught him but they won't catch me. ¿ Eh Papá?
Right.
Listen Firecracker you listen to me.
Listen why don't you come with me and we will work together?
And we will become rich.
What the hell is your name?
John.
What?
John.
- What is your name?
- John.
(Juan laughs) That's fantastic. That is incredible.
My name is Juan and yours is John.
Juan and John.
So what?
Can't you understand that is that is the...
Oh...
Destiny.
No. And I mean it.
Why?
You want more money? I'll give you more than half. I don't care about the money.
As long as we can work together.
Listen what I'm telling you.
We are like two brothers.
You make the holes with the holy water and then I walk in and do the dirty work.
Listen it takes one bandito to know another.
- So you can read?
- You don't have to read.
I see a man's picture I see a price
I know that man is in trouble.
Hey what kind of trouble are you in?
- Oh we fought a revolution in Ireland.
- A revolution?
Seems revolutions are all over the world like the crops.
We had a revolution.
The brave people went in.
What it did to them was terrible. Pancho Villa the world's best bandit chief two balls like a bull he went in the revolution as a great bandit came out as what? Nothing.
A general. That to me is the bullshit.
Wait a minute.
You come here to join the revolution?
No no.
One was enough for me.
Stop! You dirty...
...son of a bitch!
Gringo... bastard!
Hey!
Duck, you sucker!
- Say which way is it to Lucanina?
- Fuck you! Go find it yourself!
Mexico is big but for you it is going to be very big!
(Juan) John where are you? It's us!
Come on come on you.
Come on in there.
Just a little further inside.
That's right heathen bastards.
What's this?
You crazy? You talk to yourself now?
Oh my friend didn't I tell you Mexico was big?
Oh shit.
Who are those people inside?
You mean who were those people inside?
Who were they? Who were those people inside?
(Juan) Chulo!
Who were those people for Christ's sake?
Well one of them was Aschenbach then there was three soldiers and one captain.
Everybody dead in there.
Will you keep quiet and go get our friend's equipment together?
Anyway when I went to Aschenbach and I told him
I said you wanted to see him he wouldn't believe that.
I said "That's too bad because he's discovered silver."
Then he was ready to come running.
The other one the captain... I think the captain and Aschenbach were working together.
The captain says "I want to see the man."
I said "How can you see him? He's blown off his hand with dynamite he is bleeding to death."
When they heard that they broke their asses to get here.
Anyway it's no problem because there are diamonds here no questions.
Also you have no contract so... you are free.
There will be one little problem with the army.
They will have a hot ass when it comes to the death of a captain.
But don't worry.
I am your friend Juan and I will help.
I will do anything say anything...
No no no. I don't need any help from you to know I've been screwed.
You fuckin' chicken thief.
What do you want with me?
Nothing.
I just thought that maybe...
...we could go to Mesa Verde.
The bank. Isn't there anything else you remember about Mesa Verde?
Yes there's a place where you can sit down and eat.
- When you look in front you...
- See the bank.
That's right. How do you know?
Listen Mesa Verde that's only the beginning.
Let me tell you it will be Juan and John the two especialistas in bank s eh?
We'll call it Johnny and Johnny.
That's more American.
Amigo we go to America there are bank s all over the place.
In California Colorado
Kansas City Texas and Austin.
You have to think of the big future that we have ahead of us.
I'm thinking of the big train behind us.
Hey! Out of the way!
Hey you.
I know that face.
Where have I seen you before?
(conductor) Stop right where you are!
Drop that knife you bastard.
I have family.
I have a family too.
Beautiful eh?
'Uno dos uno dos uno dos'
'Pelotón izquierda'
'Uno dos uno dos uno dos'
'Uno dos uno dos uno dos'
¿ Tienen algo qué pedir?
¿ Y tu?
Listos
'Armas'
'Preparen'
Apunten
- 'Fuego'
- (gunshots)
Hey God you're sure this is Mesa Verde?
Do you have your beans with chilli?
I don't want nothing from you.
- Aw come on have some beans.
- Listen you son of a bitch!
You pull that trick on me again
I break your goddamn head!
Well for Christ's sake.
A train comes along and I take it.
- Been waiting in your Mesa Verde ever since.
- It's not my Mesa Verde.
- This place is covered with soldiers like flies.
- Just the way we like it.
Just the way we like it?
If it's a revolution... it's confusion.
What are you talking about?
Revolution confusion?
Where there's confusion a man who knows what he wants...
...stands a good chance of getting it.
- I don't understand you.
This him?
That's him.
Him who?
- Do you trust me?
- No.
- You want to get inside there?
- Sí
Well I'm going to see to it you have that chance. Come on.
(doctor) Don't move goddamn it!
Hold him still.
That does it. Relax now. Relax.
It's all over.
If you'd let this infection go any longer your widow would be paying my bill.
Mallory!
You've hardly joined us here in Mesa Verde.
Already you're front-page news.
"Irish dynamiter wanted for murder."
You have a real talent for making friends.
(chuckles) You've stirred up a hornet's nest.
I'll grant you the captain but...
...till now nobody dared take a crack at foreign capitalists.
Not even Pancho Villa.
It seems even His Majesty's Secret Service would like to get their hands on you.
And yet you are an asset to us.
Even if sometimes you do drink a bit too much.
Who says I drink too much?
Your liver does.
What about that one him?
He's all right.
Except that when operating he cuts deeper than I do.
What the doctor means is one time we did a little work together.
And now to our work friends.
I have good news.
In two days Villa and Zapata will attack simultaneously from north and south.
We here like those in other cities must begin parallel actions of harassment.
Pereto's downfall is just a question of week s.
Whereas Miguel's is only a question of hours if he doesn't stop smoking.
Easy to say.
We'll attack in four places at the same time.
Antonio you hit the city hall and old prisons.
You will need to divide into two groups one of them under the command of José.
Jesús the railway station and the marshalling yards as planned right?
Get in position in good time in small groups so you won't attract attention.
And act like ordinary travellers or railroad employees.
You Manolo together with Juanito will attack the army barrack s with our main forces agreed?
This is their point of maximum concentration and is the key to the success of our plan.
You must create the impression of a massive attack.
And if necessary be prepared to make the final sacrifice.
The fourth and last target
Ortega the post office.
When the enemy is busy on four fronts we'll move against our real objective.
Do we still agree?
- You'll need men.
- I only need one man.
One?
Sí
Him?
Him? Him?
What is with this "him"? Him who? Who him?
To do what? That's what I want to know!
To attack the bank.
The bank?
We will take care of the bank.
That's why we're here so don't worry about that.
Well then what can I say?
Except... I hope you make it.
Me too. And him.
Well we'll meet again tonight to discuss details.
I have to go now.
I left a woman in labour and she can't wait till the revolution is over.
- Tierra y libertad
- (all) 'Tierra y libertad'
Leave one at a time and keep out of sight.
Speaking of sight how's your cataract?
At least I have a good eye. With the other...
Shh! You don't have to say anything.
I understand everything.
'Tierra y libertad'
Y libertad
'Capitán' 'Aviselas Capitán'
'Pronto' 'Hola muénvase'
Go.
Psst psst! 'Oye'
Bravo Chulo.
Take it take it.
There must be a lot of money in the bank look at all those soldiers.
- You know how this work s?
- Sí It's a...
...short fuse.
- No.
- No?
Normal rate.
30 seconds.
Sí 30 seconds.
- What did you find?
- Nothing but scrap paper.
Wait a minute. Hey it's pointing down there.
Psst!
There is the safe!
Duck, you suckers
- Where are you going for Christ's sake?
- I don't know but something's wrong.
I went into the bank.
There's no money there nothing.
The bank and the money were transferred to Mexico City a month ago.
They've been using this place for a political prison ever since.
- What? A political prison?
- I never said a thing about money.
All I asked was if you wanted to get inside.
But this bank is my life this is my dream.
The reality is you've just liberated 150 patriots through sheer courage in the face of danger.
Ah yes...
...you're a grand hero of the revolution now.
- ¡ Vivela Juan!
- I don't want to be a hero. I want the money!
The money!
- You taught me one thing.
- What?
How to get fucked!
- What's that?
- It's a map.
It's your country you're lying all over.
Not my country.
My country is me and my family.
Well your country's also Huerta...
...and the Governor and landlords.
And Gunther Ruiz and his locusts.
- This little revolution we're having here.
- Revolution?
Please don't try to tell me about revolution!
I know how revolutions start.
People that read book s go to people that don't read book s and say
- "The time has come for change."
- Shh!
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shit shush!
I know what I'm talking about when I'm talking about revolutions!
The people who read book s go to the people who can't read and say "We need change" so the poor people make the change.
The people who read the book s sit around big polished tables and talk and talk and eat.
But what has happened to the poor people?
They are dead!
That's your revolution.
Shh.
So please don't tell me about revolutions.
Then what happens?
The same fucking thing starts all over again!
'Capitán'
'Vamos'
I don't like it either.
Only Gunther Ruiz is less than 20 miles from here on the road that leads to that bridge.
They will comb the area bush by bush.
So the order is to pull back hide in the San Ysidro caves.
Oh that's a brilliant order.
Here we are facing it.
You and the rest of you dreamers want to piss it up against the wall!
Not everybody can fight.
There are those who must organise co-ordinate.
Yes yes of course.
Yeah well...
...don't pay any attention to me.
It's personal.
Sorry about those orders. I'm staying.
I don't give a fuck about your revolutions.
I'm tired of running up and down these mountains and getting nowhere so I've stopped.
Right here at the bridge of San Jorge.
Maybe it's out of spite for you and your slow dream or maybe...
Ah maybe my feet are sore.
'Hombres' Me and irlandés are gonna catch ourselves a couple of fucking locusts.
'Atente' You go back and hide in the grotto.
If things go bad here every man for himself.
You move your asses! ¿ Comprenden?
If something happens and your father doesn't come back then I pray that the great God in heaven takes care of you.
Well... Good luck.
Thank you.
Listen when they are out of sight we will make a run for it. ¿ SÍ?
No? You can't mean to stay here? All those explosions must have gone to your head!
Remember John and Juan?
America.
The millions.
No.
I don't understand!
Wasn't that was a trick for us to get out?
- What can we do against those locusts?
- You'd be doing me a favour if you'd leave.
If I had a choice between a chicken thief and ridding the world of a few uniforms
I'd not choose the chicken thief.
OK.
OK.
No!
Oh no no. You will like that huh?
Well you listen to me you Irish piece of shit!
You think you're the only man with the balls to stay? You are wrong!
I have the balls and I stay.
He says there's no danger just watch the bridge from a long way.
No matter how I look with them
I'm still too close to the bridge.
Why am I mixed up in this revolution anyway?
God why didn't you strike me down instead of letting me say "I stay too"?
Oh look at him! All because of him.
He acts like a tourist only he's staying.
(laughs) Look at him.
What the hell does he care?
He is having fun.
I'm glad he's having fun God because I am not having fun.
Oh-ho no.
Hey...
What's this?
Now he goes to sleep huh?
Go ahead you sleep sleep.
I tell you something when he's asleep I'll go.
Shh!
Stop over there Sergeant.
Hey!
God only an idiot could sleep at a time like this!
Hey!
Abandon the truck s!
Break rank s and take cover under the bridge!
Artillery fire. The bridge!
All of them.
Six.
I've never counted them before.
No Juan no.
No for Christ's sake.
They're waiting for you out there.
(soldier) 'No se mueven'
'Capitán'
(man) Hold it!
Move that bastard out of the truck.
(man) See that he gets to the camp alive!
'Uno dos uno'
'Uno dos uno dos'
'Uno dos uno dos uno dos'
'Pelotón alto'
'lzquierda'
'Posición de tiro'
¿ Tienen algo qué pedir?
Pelotón
'Preparen'

¿ Tienes algo qué pedir?
'Posición de tiro'
'Preparen armas'
'Apunten'
(John) Duck you suckers!
'Preparen' 'Armas'
'Apunten'
'Fuego'
But for the rich you sing.
Oh Jesus Juan.
Anyway if they ever get this thing under way you might be able to...
...might be make the border by what some time tonight don't you think?
America. It's America Juan!
Oh Jesus if it's as great as they say it is filled bags stuffed full of dreams...
Juan?
Oh Jesus.
Jesus Juan.
What is it Juan and... John?
Johnny and Johnny?
I make the holes and you get in. 50-50 right?
What's happening?
Oh they're just moving the train around.
Seems we'll be leaving shortly.
The uniforms have loaded the last of their shit.
Get out of the way.
What do you want from me you scum?
Let me by.
It's yours.
There's a fortune inside.
...pearls.
(man shouts) 'Jóvenes a México'
Well this will not be going to America.
(Juan) Maybe the train won't but we will.
Hey...
Which way is America?
Well it's sure as hell not that way.
That's the way.
Well then...
...let's go.
Even Pancho Villa's heard much about you.
He's always saying
"I want to meet this Miranda."
Me?
That's right.
The military junta commander told us everything that you've done.
Whatever you heard I assure you they were only words.
Words cannot describe what Juan has done and suffered for the cause.
Hey doctor.
How you been eh?
This is a man who should talk to Villa.
Hey.
John.
We thought we'd lost you doctor.
Have you got a light?
Listen Gunther Ruiz is after us and Villa wants to talk to me.
We should get outta here.
Jesus Juan you can't leave now.
You're a glorious hero of the revolution.
Can I tell you something?
Fuck you!
That's all.
A military train carrying over 1000 soldiers and heavy weapons is heading straight towards us.
What about Villa's troops?
He met resistance in the Sierra and ask s us to hold out for 24 hours.
- Where the hell are we?
- Approximately here.
Ah it's a beautiful desert there.
Not a stream or a canyon in 100 miles.
- How long you think it'll take them to get here?
- Three hours more or less.
Three hours.
Well it look s as though we'll have to stop 'em right here doesn't it?
All that takes is unbolting a couple of yards of track.
But then what? They'd still slaughter us.
Wait.
There's more than one way to stop a train.
- How much dynamite have we?
- Maybe 200 Ibs.
Is that enough for you?
Oh yes. It'll have to do all right.
- But I also need a locomotive and a man.
- Sí sí sí OK.
OK.
- Someone who's brave and loyal to the cause.
- Never mind that. What do I have to do?
Someone like Dr Villega.
Well...
- I... I'm honoured.
- (John) I don't doubt it doctor.
Also because an old friend of ours is in command of that train.
A Colonel Gunther Ruiz.
(John) Let's get shovelling man.
We'll never get up enough pressure that way.
Come on put your back in it Villega.
Let's stop pretending right away.
You know everything don't you?
- You sensed it or guessed it.
- Simpler than that Villega.
I saw you that night in the rain.
I see.
You've already judged and condemned me.
That's why you brought me with you. To kill me.
It's easy to judge. Have you ever been tortured?
Are you sure you wouldn't talk?
I was sure. And yet I talked.
Some men died because of me.
What should I do? Kill myself? Why?
The dead remain dead but I have not changed.
I still believe in the same things.
I can still serve the cause.
Shut up Villega! Shut up for Christ's sake.
When I started using dynamite
I believed in many things. All of it!
Finally I believe only in dynamite.
I don't judge you Villega.
I did that only once in my life.
Get shovelling!
(John) The end of the line Villega.
And I can't help you now.
Just close your eyes and jump.
'Dios mío frena'
Oh shit...
God...
Hey.
Man remember huh?
You remember what you told me huh?
You told me about America.
And the bank s and the gold.
Like you told me on the train remember?
Hey hey.
Hey.
No you son of a bitch. Come on you son of a bitch. You know you told me that.
You leave me now what the fuck is gonna happen to me?
- You'll make it General.
- Oh shit I don't want to be a general.
Come on talk to me.
Keep talking.
Talk. Tell me about Villega Villega.
Remember Villega?
- Villega?
- Sí
He died.
He died a great...
...grand glorious hero of the revolution.
OK.
Easy easy. I'll go I'll get help huh?
General?
- Have you a light?
- Sí
Oh my friend...
...I'd hate to give you a royal screwing.
I go get help.
Johnny!
(thinks) What about me?
I'm first!
♪ This is the way we go to church
♪ Go to church, go to church
♪ This is the way we go to church... ♪
The party's over.
You men can get movin'.
Hell, I don't know who you are but... why be a hog, man?
She can handle four of us.
We also got some mighty fine whiskey.
- Waiting for you!
- Besides...
Now what are you gonna do, you bastard?
You may get me... but you sure as hell ain't gonna get any part of her, unless you like to have your fun with a corpse!
You keep standing around like that, the sun's gonna burn the hell out of you.
They told me they were gonna kill me, kill me so I couldn't report them.
They told me...
Well, they ain't telling you much now.
So get dressed.
You're a good man.
All my life I will pray to the Virgin to protect you from harm.
Jesus Christ.
And I will also pray that for all your life you have what you desire.
What the hell's a nun doin' out here?
I'm on a mission.
In Mexico a nun can travel safely among murderers and thieves.
I could have avoided these men but I came to ask for food.
- They give you any?
- No.
- There's probably some leftovers.
- I couldn't eat just now.
Well, you look like you could use a shot of whiskey.
Whiskey? Thank you.
- Your mule?
- Yes.
No provisions, no canteen?
Just how'd you figure on existing?
I was confident the Lord would provide.
Three more like them?
He also provided you.
- Which way you headed?
- North.
North?
Well, I'm headed south.
So I'll take those ponies and be on my way.
First we must cover them with stones.
We can't leave without giving them a Christian burial of some kind.
- After the way they treated you?
- Of course.
You got to be touched in the head.
Do you have a shovel?
Sister, raise your eyes to heaven.
Now, are they or are they not
God's creatures?
- Of course they are.
- Why rob them of this nourishment?
Do you have a shovel?
Yeah, it's on my packhorse.
Would you get it, please, for the sake of my soul if not your own?
Sister, I don't mind shootin' 'em but I'm not gonna sweat over 'em.
You're as stubborn as my mule, you know?
Worse.
How are the blisters?
Other things in life have hurt more.
Thank you, Brother.
- It's Hogan.
- I'm Sister Sara.
Well, Sister Sara, if you ever get tired of being a nun, you'll be an A-1 gravedigger.
Have some of these beans.
Those fellas weren't much in a fight but one of 'em wasn't a bad cook.
I couldn't eat anything they cooked but I'll have some water, please.
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.
- You really are touched!
- Give that back, please.
Sister, you wanna bless 'em, bless 'em dry.
I've obliged you 'bout all I'm going to and now I'll say goodbye.
You stay out of that sun now, you hear?
Or you're gonna really be in trouble.
Goodbye. Thank you again.
God go with you.
Hey, you're in luck.
Looks like a French cavalry.
You can probably travel along with them.
Please help me.
They're looking for me.
Why?
I was raising money for the Mexican army.
I had to escape in the night.
Lady, if you weren't a nun
I'd let you save your own bacon.
All right, do as I say and act fast.
Get rid of that cross, it shines like a mirror.
You bring that last horse and follow me.
Son of a bitch.
What are you doing?
I'm doing for you what... no Holy Virgin's in any position to do.
We'll walk slowly so as not to stir up this stream bed any more than we have to.
Why did you put that dead man on the horse?
A horse with a rider makes a deeper print than a horse without.
If we're lucky, the French will follow those ponies.
Here. Eat this.
I told you to eat something back there.
Your stomach keeps growling, we'll have the whole French army on us.
These little noises can't be heard.
Why are you so angry with me?
Well... maybe a nun ought not be so good-lookin'.
The way I look is of no importance.
I'm married to our Lord Jesus Christ.
That's what I'm steamed up about, if you'll pardon my being frank.
- I'm not offended, Brother Hogan.
- Don't "Brother" me.
Excuse me.
They split up, damn it, and they're catchin' up.
I wouldn't just sit there, move.
We can't outrun 'em.
You can get in there.
I may not shoot all of them but I'll get their attention.
Wait, then head on out the other way.
You've been a wonderful friend,
Mr Hogan. Go with God.
Leave Him out of this?
Get movin'.
- I can't go in there.
- Why not?
There's a rattlesnake in there.
Keep singin', partner.
Get that mule in here.
Here, if we get split up, this'll make good eatin'.
Well, well. Too bad nuns don't play poker, you'd be sharp at it.
There's no way I can thank you.
I suppose you'll be starting south now.
No, it's gettin' too close to dark.
We'll have a hot meal first.
- Can nuns cook?
- I do.
Good. Your late gentlemen friends donated us some beans and coffee.
But first I'll scratch up some firewood.
It's hard to believe that rattlesnake could taste so delicious.
Here. Ladies first.
Thank you.
So you were headed north.
Any particular place?
I want to try to find a Juarista band, I'll be safe with them.
- Where were you comin' from?
- Chihuahua.
- Chihuahua? You live there?
- For several years.
- French garrison in Chihuahua.
- Right next to the church.
You wouldn't by any chance know how many soldiers in the garrison?
- More or less.
- About 200 and some cannon.
How do you know all that?
The French officers wanted to learn Spanish so my mother superior assigned the task to me, I also speak French.
I went into the garrison three times a week.
I hate them. How I hate them.
- Ain't it a sin for nuns to hate?
- Not if it's something evil.
The French army killing and torturing Mexicans, trying to force them to become one of their colonies.
- How big is the garrison?
- Two storeys. It was a monastery.
- A building with an open patio?
- A beautiful patio...
- A balcony and stairs leading down?
- That's right.
You say it's next to a church.
How far apart are they exactly?
In some places not more than ten or twelve feet.
From the roof of the church, is the garrison higher or lower?
Lower. Much lower.
- Sentries?
- Day and night at the front gate.
Sister Sara, you're gonna slow me up some, but I'll take you to one of those guerrilla bands you're lookin' for.
- Do you belong to one of them?
- Till I get paid, yeah.
Paid? You mean in gold?
Well, if they pay me off in tortillas,
I'm gonna shoot 'em right in the eye.
But the Juaristas are too poor to hire anybody.
I made a deal to work out a plan to take the garrison.
If it pays off,
I get half the French treasury.
Then you don't have any sympathy for their cause?
Not theirs or anybody else's.
See, I spent two years in a war in the States.
Right now, all I'm interested in is money.
If money is all you care about, then why did you fight in that war?
Everybody's got a right to be a sucker once.
Mr Hogan.
The 14th of July is a French holiday.
By noon of that day last year the entire French garrison was drunk.
- What's the date today?
- July the 6th.
Beautiful.
That information puts gold right in my pocket.
This calls for a drink.
Well, I'll be leaving you for a few moments.
Be careful not to go too far, there may be another rattler.
I'll pray as I walk.
I'll keep my back turned.
Don't worry.
You're a real gentleman, Mr Hogan.
I guess you haven't slept much on the ground.
Oh, I'm very tired. I'll sleep.
For somebody who's wore out, you sure got a happy look.
It was a miracle you found me when you did, Mr Hogan.
That was no miracle, just an accident and life is full of 'em.
No. It was a miracle.
Yes, ma'am.
Two men are ridin' along side by side, a bullet ricochets off a rock, kills one of them but not the other... just an accident, no miracle.
Then you believe there are no miracles?
Well... Now, you take that fella this morning.
He could've picked up that stick of dynamite and thrown it back at me before I shot him.
Now, that would have been a miracle.
It's nice to hear you laugh, ma'am.
You think nuns don't laugh?
I don't know. I never spent the night with one before.
Good night, Mr Hogan.
Thank you again for everything.
Hey, wake up, Sister.
Time to get movin'.
I'm so stiff.
I'm not accustomed to riding like that.
Would you please help me up?
Thank you.
Oh, my every muscle is aching.
How can I possibly ride again today?
I ride from sunup to sundown.
You either keep up or you don't.
You'll feel better after a few hours on your mule.
You make very good coffee.
A man on his own has to take care of himself.
- So you're not married?
- Nope.
- Ever been?
- Nope.
- Want to be?
- Nope.
- Don't you want a woman of your own?
- What for?
Share your name, bear your children, be a companion?
To ask me to quit drinkin', quit gamblin', save my money and to bitch about her aches and pains? No, thanks.
- Must be a lonely life.
- It's a great life.
Women when I want 'em and none with the name of Hogan.
How about you, ma'am? Haven't you ever wanted to be a whole woman?
Have a man make love to you?
Have children?
I've chosen a different way of life.
What about those feelings your god gave every woman, including you?
- I've always wondered.
- Well, we're human, of course.
When we get those feelings, we pray until they pass.
In your case, just how much praying does that take?
What about before you became a nun?
Did you ever have a man?
No.
- Ever been kissed by one?
- No.
Haven't you ever laid awake wondering what it would be like?
No.
All the women I've ever met were natural-born liars but I never knew about nuns till now.
You're right. I lied.
I'll say one thing, Sister.
I sure woulda liked to have met up with you before you took to them clothes and them vows.
That limp's getting worse.
Stone bruised.
It'll take a week for that to heal up.
Maybe the people in this village will hide you out until this animal comes around.
- Why couldn't I ride the packhorse?
- He carries my equipment.
I ain't gonna miss bein' in Chihuahua on the 14th.
- Please, Brother Hogan...
- I told you not to "Brother" me.
All right, Mr Mule. You were right.
You are as stubborn as my mule.
When we get up to that village,
Sister, then I'll say adiós.
This is where we part company.
- Now what are you doin'?
- I must say a prayer at this shrine.
You said your prayers last night.
It's a sin to pass a shrine without praying.
- Not if you shut your eyes.
- Please, Mr Hogan.
All right, it's a small shrine, let's make it a small prayer.
You see, Mr Hogan, what a little prayer can do?
The Lord provided a kind gentleman who accepted my mule for this creature of God.
Now I can still be with you.
Your mule for that burro?
If that kind gentleman traded you even, you won't be meeting up with him in heaven.
This man lives in the hills there.
Three hours ago on his way to the market he passed a French patrol.
Which way were they headed?
All right. Let's get the supplies we need and move out.
- I want you up in that tree.
- What tree? Why?
Please, Mr Hogan, looking down from heights frighten me.
Then look up.
I think there's a mountain lion around here and I want you up here.
Excuse me, Sister.
What are you doing?
If you can't see him, you can't shoot him.
How are you doin', Sister?
- Looking up.
- Good.
We won't talk now.
I'd like him to make his run if he's going to.
What the hell?
Come on, get down from there.
Turn around, I'll catch you.
What about Santa Maria?
French soldiers at Satevo were waiting for a train for Santa Maria.
Santa Maria's where I'm headed.
Those Juaristas are hiding out there.
Find out why the French are going there.
All right. You can be sure I will.
All right, Satevo's a long way away, so let's get some sleep.
By the way, Sister,
I guess I owe you an apology.
When I was trying to get you up the tree, I...
Oh, no apology is necessary,
Mr Hogan.
In emergencies, the Church grants dispensation.
It's no sin that you pushed me up the tree with your hands on my ass.
Where'd you learn that kind of English?
- What kind?
- Ass.
Oh, in the convent.
Sister Harriet taught us words for parts of the body.
This part she called the ass.
Where is this Sister Harriet from, anyway?
New Orleans. Why?
I'd sure as hell like to know what she did before she became a nun.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Please. An officer is dying.
Come with me, please.
Even though you are not a priest, you can give him some spiritual comfort.
Our colonel is very, very ill.
Deliver his soul into your soul,
Mary Mother of God...
You filthy bitch!
Kiss the cross. Kiss the cross.
Sister, he was delirious.
Forgive him.
I forgive him.
I forgive him with all my heart.
God damn it!
I don't see how you can drink this stuff.
You'll get cockeyed drunk!
What happened?
I was recognized, that's what happened.
- By who?
- I've never been so frightened.
I had visions of being shot.
- Who recognized you? What did he do?
- He died.
What the hell are you talking about?
I was asked to give comfort to a colonel dying of fever.
He was one of the officers I taught
Spanish at the fort in Chihuahua.
Oh, thank God no one believed what he called me.
What did he call you?
A filthy Juarista.
All right, he died and you're safe.
Now, what did you find out?
They're waiting for a train due today for Santa Maria so they can load it with supplies and ammunition.
You did all right, Sister.
Between here and Santa Maria there's got to be a gorge.
Where there's a gorge there's a trestle.
All we got to do is get there before the train does.
Will you burn it?
I'll blow it to hell with the train on it!
Come on, you'll have to ride, else I'll have to leave you.
- I am not intoxicated.
- That's a hell of a lot of whiskey.
My faith in God will turn it to water.
We'd better hurry. I've never seen a train blown to hell before.
- Get out of my line of fire, Sister.
- Can you kill them all with that?
Put it away. These are Yaquis.
They're wild and pagan but the Church has reached some of them.
Can you get on your horse?
I think so. I think so.
Then tell me when you're on it.
- You must stop that. Are you on?
- I'm on.
♪ Yes, I killed a man one day, so they say
♪ I beat him on the head and I left him there for dead
♪ Yes, I left him there for dead, damn his eyes ♪
Oh, you got the moss.
That'll stop the flesh putrefying.
- What should I do with it?
- I'll take you through step by step.
First, I got to get drunker than hell.
- How long since I got hit?
- You asked me that ten minutes ago.
- What was your answer?
- About an hour.
All right. I want you to cut a groove in the shaft of this arrow just deep enough for a good pinch of gunpowder.
Gunpowder?
Gunpowder, that's right.
That'll cauterize the insides, they tell me.
I don't know if this arrow... is near my heart but I don't think so.
Some women have said my heart ain't exactly... in the right place.
All right, start cutting and don't worry if I yell a little bit.
Come on, my beautiful Sister who saved my damn life from those damn Yaquis.
You don't want me to lose my deal now, do you?
♪ And the parson, he did come, he did come... ♪
This ain't such a nice song but it's the only one I know well enough I can sing drunk.
- I don't care what you sing.
- You got a beautiful character.
Anyway, it's about a Protestant parson, not a Catholic one.
♪ And the parson, he did come, he did come
♪ And he looked so bloody glum, as he talked of kingdom come
♪ Well, he can kiss my ruddy bum
♪ Damn his eyes ♪
I need another bottle.
More whiskey.
That's the last bottle you got.
Last one?
Oh, that's bad news, Sister.
I'm sorry I can't share any with you but you've got to have a steady hand.
♪ The sheriff, he did come too, he came too
♪ Yes, the sheriff, he came too, he came too
♪ The sheriff, he came too
♪ With his men all dressed in blue
♪ Lord, they were a bloody crew
♪ Damn their eyes ♪
- There, finished.
- That's not bad. Not bad.
- You're married to a carpenter.
- Now what?
Cut the shaft off right there.
- Cut it?
- Yep.
♪ Now it's up the rope I'll go
♪ Yes, it's up the rope I'll go, up I'll go
♪ And those bastards down below

♪ Damn their eyes ♪
May I break it?
All right. How much time's gone by?
- Over an hour.
- Oh, that damn train.
That train is on its way,
I know it is.
Remember what I told you about accidents?
We didn't have to run across those damn Yaquis but we did.
No miracle, just a rotten, lousy accident that's gonna cost me my whole deal.
Get me up straight.
Get me up straight.
You are a beautiful woman,
Sister Sara.
You feel like a beautiful woman, you smell like beautiful woman.
- Please, Mr Hogan.
- I can't help thinking, that first time I saw you and you were almost naked...
- You must forget that.
- I can't, my beautiful Sister.
I don't want to forget.
Every night when we bed down next to each other I think of you that way and I want to reach out and touch you and hold you and feel you.
I forgive you because I know that if you weren't drunk...
Maybe. Maybe so.
But you can't stop a man from wishing.
I sure wish you weren't a nun.
Please, Mr Hogan.
All right.
Get me some gunpowder out of my saddle bag.
Don't come near me till I tell you.
Pour some in your hand... and leave the pouch there.
Fill the groove. Fill the groove.
That's fine.
All right, now comes the hard part.
Cos we gotta time this perfect.
As soon as I light the powder, you drive the arrow through me and pull it out the other side.
What do I hit it with?
Take the knife, put the flat part over the end... and hit it with the gun.
And please, Sister Sara, please hit it a straight blow, not a glancing one?
What if I don't hit it straight?
The hell with that, my beautiful Sister.
The arrow will break off inside me.
Now, I know you're an A-1 gravedigger but...
All right.
What do I do with the moss?
Plug the holes both sides.
Push it in about a half-inch.
All right.
One last swallow and it's up to you, Doc.
- Prayin' for me?
- Yes.
Well, then I must be drunk enough.
Damn my eyes...
One last thing, Sister.
The powder will flare up when I light it, so watch yourself.
Now, you can load up the animals.
We'll be on our way as soon as you get this stick out of me.
Ready?
Mr Hogan!
Mr Hogan... Mr Hogan, remember the train with the French supplies.
You have to blow it up.
- How long since I been hit?
- Hours.
What?
- You fell unconscious.
- Why didn't you wake me up?
- I thought you were...
- You thought. The hell you thought.
You let me down, Sister.
You let me down.
Then why don't you get on your horse?
Because...
You're too drunk to ride alone.
I'll have to get on with you.
Hold on to the mane.
Lean back against me. Lean back.
Tell your horse to get moving.
I like being in the arms of a good-looking nun.
How do you like it, Sister?
The Church allows this for your safety but you may not take liberties.
Will you look at that trestle? Couldn't be sweeter.
- It's a miracle.
- A great place for an accident.
Is this small package of dynamite powerful enough?
Not if you put it at the base but if you put it up high on those braces - pow!
How can you climb that trestle with your shoulder...?
- Oh, no, Mr Hogan. No.
- Now, wait a minute.
- Remember I saved your life.
- I saved yours today, too.
I saved yours twice from the French.
I saved yours twice - the arrow?
What are you gonna do? Are you gonna desert me in my hour of need?
What about that rattlesnake when you were hiding?
That was easy, no risk at all.
Did I or did I not come to you in your hour of need?
This is my hour of need.
What kind of need is your need?
All you have on your mind is money.
What's more important than that?
My life.
If I climb that trestle, I'll fall.
A fine psalm-singing hypocrite you are.
The French are gonna slaughter a whole outfit of your Juaristas and you're the only one who can help 'em and you won't climb one lousy, stinkin' trestle.
That's right, Sister, lean on it.
A little good, old-fashioned Christian faith will carry you up there like a bird.
I know you're scared, Sara, but those braces are easy to climb.
You just keep thinking of all those
Christian lives you'll be saving.
Have faith in that shiny cross and God and all those saints will be right up there with you.
You haven't yet told me how you'll set this off when I...
Let me worry about that. I'll do it with my rifle. Now get going.
Surely that train's on its way.
Keep goin'.
I want the dynamite up on top so I can get a clear shot at it.
That's it, Sister.
You're entitled, you certainly are entitled, but I never did see anybody get used to hard liquor so fast.
I want to take a few practice shots without ammunition.
You turn around and face the bridge.
Come on, turn around.
Just like that.
Now, when I tell you to,
I want you to take a deep breath and hold it.
Come on, grab the end of the barrel.
This ain't easy.
Take your fingers off the top of it.
All right, now take a deep breath.
Hold it.
- You wouldn't have hit it.
- Yes, I would've.
- The gun moved when you fired.
- I'd have hit it.
Put out your hand.
Let's see how steady it is.
You're still drunk, you'll never hit that.
- I'll hit it.
- Put a bullet in it.
Let's see if you can hit something about the same size.
That little rock over there, the one on top of the big rock, let's see if you can hit that.
Will you cock this for me?
Pull down that lever as hard as you can, then slam it shut.
Perfect. All right. Yeah.
Now... take a breath.
Now cock it again.
We'd better try it with you sitting and me kneeling.
Go ahead. Get down.
This ain't easy, now.
All right, take a breath.
Can you shoot?
No, and I climbed that thing for nothing!
Take it easy, just wait.
I'm sobering up fast.
Meanwhile, you fix me a cup of hot coffee.
I'll fix you some hot coffee!
Sober up! You sober up, you dirty bastard or I'll kill you!
Sit up!
Now, tell me when to hold my breath.
Dear Mary, Mother of God, help this no-good atheist to shoot straight.
Hold your breath.
Hold your breath.
What did I tell you?
Did I or did I not hear you call me a bastard?
Well, I suppose whiskey can make a man hear anything.
Dear Lord, forgive him for the impurity of his thoughts.
There's the cantina I'm looking for.
I may need your help.
- Can you go into a saloon?
- In times like this...
The Church grants dispensations,
I know.
- Yes, I am speaking English.
- Good. Tequila.
- Oh. Would you like something?
- Do you have lemonade?
I'll have lemonade.
You're getting drunk again, are you?
Oh, I never get drunk unless I'm shot by Yaquis.
- Then why the tequila?
- Just to oil up my arm. That's all.
I don't think they've seen a nun in here for some time.
Not one like you, that's for sure.
- Gracias.
- Hey!
- Any of these men speak English?
- No, señor.
- You're sure?
- Sure. Me only.
Good. I'd like to order a bottle of French champagne, year 1789.
French champagne, 1789.
- What is it, señor?
- What's what?
This "champagne"?
Is there another
El Gato Negro saloon in this town?
- Are you the owner of this one?
- No.
- Well, who is?
- Mi padre. My father.
When does he get here?
Por favor, señor.
That's swell, that's my luck.
They give me a code and the man who has it isn't here.
He'll probably show up on the 15th of July.
Mr Hogan, you should be happy you're still alive.
- Where the hell's your father?
- Señor, he is sick. Enfermo.
It's important I see him.
Where is he?
Since three days now, he cannot talk.
All this side, no move.
- Does he understand when you speak?
- Sí, señor.
Does he understand English?
Not so good like me but... my mother, she with him.
He no can speak.
May we see him?
Please to come.
Francisco.
Can you understand me, señor?
That means yes.
I need a bottle of French champagne, year 1789.
I must see Colonel Beltran at once.
Can you take me to where his camp is?
What about your son?
Can he take me there?
Does anybody in this town know where the camp is?
She says the candle-maker knows.
Now, we go that way.
- How far, Horacio?
- Not far.
Put away your gun, gringo.
Name's Hogan. Beltran's expecting me.
You mean Colonel Beltran.
Colonel, general, what difference does it make? Take me to him.
I have been waiting for you, Hogan.
What happened to you?
I stopped a Yaquis arrow.
- So you never got to Chihuahua?
- Nope.
Sister Sara here saved me a good part of the trip.
Sister? How?
- Is the deal still on?
- I keep to my word. And you?
Good. You get me a bottle of tequila and I'll lay you out a plan as smooth as a baby's behind.
You tell me the plan,
I will tell you how smooth it is.
The roof of the garrison is lower than the roof of the church and on the 14th of July you have promised us, Sister, all the Frenchmen will be drunk.
Not bad, Hogan. Not bad.
Thank you, Sister.
Yeah, we make quite a team.
If we pull this off, we might go in the garrison business again, right?
If we follow what you did to the train by capturing the garrison,
- all of my people will take heart.
- How many men do you have?
40, but there'll be more by the time we reach Chihuahua.
- How many more?
- 50 to 60.
- I thought you were an army colonel.
- I am.
Any army I ever heard about, a colonel commands a full regiment.
Not after all the fighting we've been through.
When you got me into this, you said you had no artillery.
- What about dynamite? You have any?
- None.
Less than a hundred rifles, a few machetes and not much more.
Even drunk, the French'll blow your heads off.
You don't know my men. Each one tough, courageous, a Mexican patriot.
Isn't that sweet?
But I happen to be a Hogan patriot and I'd like to have some dynamite.
You show me the tree it's growing on,
I'll have my men pick it.
Probably plenty for sale across the border in Texas.
Yeah, but that takes money.
Even the food you ate and that bottle were donated to us.
We leave for Chihuahua tomorrow.
You can come with us and fight under my orders, my way, or go back to that Texas bar that I found you in.
I'm in on this deal and no son of a bitch is taking me out of it.
If any other bastard spoke to me like that, he would be dead.
But since you have helped Mexico,
I am giving you a chance to get on your horse and leave this camp alive.
- Now get out of here fast.
- I ain't leavin' here.
Colonel, please. This ring, it's gold. It'll buy dynamite.
Perhaps your people have other things that could be sold.
If someone shows me back to Santa
Maria, I'll go begging for help.
Dynamite would save the lives of some of my men.
I told you
I was staying in this deal, Colonel, cos you know nobody in Texas is gonna sell a load of dynamite to a Mexican.
I am asking you, buy dynamite for us.
I'd love to.
Oh, Sister.
You better sew this back on.
You don't want to have those people see you going around half-dressed.
This is better than killing each other, no?
I only figured there was gonna be one funeral - Catholic.
I didn't know that you were Catholic.
Hogan.
Easy, Hogan. There are no
Yaquis arrows here, just a nun.
- How did you do?
- I'm not sure.
You must know if you've got something worthwhile.
I just don't know how much it'll bring in Texas.
You don't?
This will buy enough dynamite to give my horse a rupture.
You did real well for me, Sister.
For the cause.
Maybe this will buy you a bottle of medicine to keep your arm well-oiled.
- Can you give this?
- I want to.
I like you better as a Juarista than as a nun, little Sister.
Well, I'll just see you in Chihuahua.
Right. If we take the fort, we'll owe ourselves a celebration.
I might even put a little whiskey in your lemonade.
- I'd like to talk to you...
- Your horses are here.
My packhorse has some handguns and some Winchesters.
- You'll know what to do with them.
- Gracias.
A gift from some old friends of Sister Sara's.
Could we talk?
I can't, Sister. I need every second to get where I'm going.
Where are we gonna meet up?
Just outside of Chihuahua riding south, there is a little church.
Be there as early as you can on the morning of the 14th.
Good riding.
Don't let those French spend that money before we can get there.
- Goodbye, Sister.
- Goodbye.
- Hello, Mr Hogan.
- How do, Sister?
- Glad to see you're back safe.
- Waiting for the dynamite?
- And you.
- What, me personal?
- I missed you.
- Yeah.
It's felt kinda wrong the past few days not having you slowing me up.
- Did it?
- Yeah, damn it.
What's the matter?
Well, you see, there's a problem, Sister...
I should have never met up with you in the first place.
Come, Beltran's waiting.
Where have you been? There are only a few more hours of daylight.
I had to go to three towns but
I've got all the dynamite we need, plus plenty of cigars.
My men will leave for the church.
- How many men do you have?
- Over 100. Let us go.
The garrison's on that side.
They must be drunk already,
I don't hear any singing.
Hogan.
Nobody's drunk.
Nobody's even drinking.
You got your calendars mixed up.
No. It is their
Independence Day, July the 14th.
It is the train you blew up.
It put them on the alert.
To attack now would be suicide.
Surprise is impossible.
Without surprise,
I never attack superior forces.
Instead of giving up, listen a minute.
I am listening but I have my mind on my men, yours is only on money.
I know how we can get a surprise.
Three streets from here is the bishop's old house.
To protect him in the rainy season there was a tunnel.
It led to the garrison when it used to be a monastery.
After the bishop moved, it was walled up. You can break through.
- Who lives there now?
- Very good friends of mine.
- Trustworthy?
- Yes. Very trustworthy.
Good, I got something that'll work.
- What?
- Fire.
When you were giving those Spanish lessons, you ever get a peek at where they kept the garrison money?
They used to pay me from a strongbox in the general's office.
Second floor in that building there.
- Was it iron or wood?
- Iron.
Great. That means it won't burn.
Now, I figure we separate your men into four groups, giving them coal oil and dynamite, and let the first group hit that main gate.
The second group goes through that tunnel into the courtyard.
The third group hits that gate over there.
The fourth group, made up of your best riflemen, we'll have up here.
They can pick off the sentries and set fire to the garrison.
This all has to happen at the same time.
First we shall wait for the cover of night.
And second, some women and children carrying a piñata filled with dynamite might get close enough to that gate.
What's a piñata?
It's an old Mexican way of livening up a party.
Come, come.
- Sarita, baby!
- Rosanna!
You are safe.
They didn't get you!
They didn't get my favorite girl!
Sister Sara, this here's a cathouse.
Oh, no, Hogan. This is no cathouse.
It's the best whorehouse in town.
Day and night out there in that desert, you made a sucker out of me?
I didn't want to. You forced me to.
What are you talking about,
I forced you to?
What did you say when we saw the cavalry?
If I wasn't a nun, you'd let me save my own bacon.
After I told you about the garrison you said if I wasn't a nun, you'd say adiós.
I wanted to be with you,
I wanted to be safe.
I tried to tell you at the camp but you were too busy.
Don't look so surprised, you no-good atheist, move!
It could be, you know,
I saved your bacon - again.
Hogan, the piñata.
- Got the coal oil?
- Yes.
Have them put this thing against the building outside the gate.
- How long is the fuse?
- Approximately 30 seconds.
That'll be enough time to get away.
There will be women and children, remember.
Any longer fuse might be seen.
Don't make the children too young or the women too old and tell 'em not to trip.
Hogan, the tunnel is open.
My men will have them free.
I can't budge it.
If we use dynamite, the element of surprise is gone.
They'd have to open the door if they had another prisoner.
The French want me very badly.
Why don't you turn me over and ask for a reward?
Even if they don't put you in here, it will get Hogan inside the gate.
It is a chance to open this door.
I don't like it.
We'll find another way.
- What other way?
- Let me think about it.
- There's no time to think about it.
- I still don't like it.
We have to get that trap door open, don't we?
What you're talking about's crazy, Sara.
Listen, Hogan, everybody's got a right to be a sucker once.
How can we be sure we hit 'em all at the same time?
I will put a man in the belfry of the church.
When he sees you and Sara entering the garrison, he will ring the bells three times.
The women with the piñata will start up the street slowly.
From the time you enter the gate and the bells ring, it will be four minutes till the explosion.
- Slow 'em up. Make it six.
- Six.
All right.
Let's go give a Spanish lesson.
Hold it.
I don't know how this is gonna come out but I owe this to myself.
- We'd better go.
- Bad time for a war.
Bad time.
Anybody in there speak English?
What is it you wish here?
I... have something out here
I think will interest you.
Come on, you little cottontail.
The Général himself will want to meet you.
Oh, Captain, wait just a minute.
I've just about had a bellyful of this little Juarista.
She's been yapping at me for three days now.
If your general wants to socialize that's up to him but I'd sooner have her locked up while we talk.
I am sorry.
They're gonna place that piñata right outside.
When I give you the signal, you get ready to move.
This little cottontail sure wishes she had that cross back.
The general will see you now.
Excuse me, monsieur,
I'm certainly not laughing at you but at this, this costume.
Come to think of it, we shall have to shoot you dressed like that.
I understand that raisin' money for the Mexican army is a crime...
- So is shooting a lieutenant.
- Did that bastard die?
Yes, the lieutenant died and you will, too.
Monsieur, I am Général le Claire.
My name's Hamilton, Général.
- Tex to my friends.
- How do you do, monsieur?
How come you caught this little pigeon for us?
Well, you see,
I have this spread up north and in rides this nun...
And when I heard that,
I said to myself,
"Tex, you just got to haul her on down here and turn her in."
I hate them damn Juaristas.
Do nothing but cause me trouble.
They got my Mexes laying around just praying for independence.
You didn't know we had posted a reward?
- A reward?
- 200 gold francs.
How about that?
Certainly better than a stab in the eye with a sharp stick.
Why don't you just lock her up and send me on my way?
Lock her up? No, monsieur.
Condemned prisoners are entitled to a last night of relaxation.
- Wine or cognac, Sara?
- Cognac, a full glass, please.
Anything my sweet-tempered little pigeon desires.
Colonel, please bring 200 francs.
Monsieur Hamilton? Tex?
Make mine smaller than the one you poured her. I'm just a country boy.
To your virtues and especially your vices, Sara.
What a pity to bury them both.
Excuse me, Monsieur Hamilton.
A people who know how to sing - the Mexicans.
- Are you familiar with that melody?
- Can't say that I am.
Las Mañanitas, for birthdays and weddings and whatnot. Lovely.
My, how touching.
They know it is our independence day and they come to toast us.
- Do you know what a piñata is?
- Can't say that I do.
Come and see. A charming invention.
They build an animal figure from papier-mâché with a clay jar hidden in the center of the body.
They fill it with candies, nuts, fruits and toys and suspend it from a tree.
Now, that's real cute.
Come on.
Over here.
Get back to the house and pour yourself another... cognac.
- Where's Sara?
- Last door. Hall left. My room.
- Sara, open up.
- I'm taking a bath!
Well, get out of the bath.
Will you come back later?
I want to be all dressed up for you.
Who the hell wants to see you dressed?
The least you can do is take off your hat.
I haven't got time for that.
Come on!
Is Strawhorn there?
Yes, sir.
The money, too?
Yes, sir.
Fire. Fire!
Where's Strawhorn?
The end of Strawhorn's gang.
But if I don't get him,
I don't get elected.
He's dead, sir.
"Vengeance is mine," sayeth the Lord.
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
O Lord, this good man died in the faithful performance of his duty.
At the hands of Jack Strawhorn.
His death shall be avenged.
Let us pray.
Hey! Drinks for everybody!
Where you been keeping yourself, Pensteman?
I want all of you to join me in a toast to a great man...
Howard Nightingale.
And there he is, our next senator!
The usual.
That's the one.
Nightingale!
Hey, how about you, mister?
I want everybody with a drink in his hand.
It's my pleasure to buy you a drink, sir.
What would be your pleasure, sir?
Someone help him.
Back inside.
Get back inside.
Get the gun.
Get back.
Mama!
Strawhorn, you're under arrest.
I got what I came for.
I ain't looking for any dividends.
What's laying back there ain't nothing to nobody.
Now, all these people can do is fire you.
For a smart lawman, there's always better towns, believe me.
And better jobs.
I ain't leaving town.
Neither are you.
The only help these people are going to give you, son, is with your coffin.
Pawn the gun.
Take the first train out.
Someday we'll have a drink.
Strawhorn!
This isn't going to make Nightingale very happy.
Keep your hands off the train.
Hey, there, keep your hands off the train.
What's going on?
It's him!
It's Nightingale!
We sure need you,
Mr. Nightingale.
It was Jack Strawhorn.
Killed them both in cold blood. It was awful.
The sheriff and a man named Pensteman.
Pensteman?
Yes, sir.
- Mount up!
- Oh, thank God.
How long ago?
About two hours.
Rode off toward the hills.
Damn fool tried to arrest him.
Should've shot him on sight.
By that time it was too late.
Nobody'll fight faster than we will.
But we couldn't tell what was happening.
- We feel safer now.
- Man's crazy.
How do we protect ourselves?
That's my job.
Marshal Nightingale?
Yes, sir.
Hellman, Tesota Sentinel.
What can I do for you?
You were commissioned to capture Strawhorn and his gang, right?
The gang is dead.
Does that mean
Strawhorn escaped?
Temporarily.
If you fail to capture Strawhorn, could this affect your campaign for senator?
I'll leave that to your impartial judgment.
I'll be back. Come on!
Hyah! Hup!
Mr. Hellman?
Get him, marshal.
Would you turn around, please?
Yeah, that's fine.
Fine. Thank you.
Just hold it right there.
Hold it right there.
Thank you.
Pepe, don't be a bigger fool than God made you!
Pretend you got a few more brains than a rabbit.
How can I have brains?
You got them all!
What a place!
I could kill you 50 times.
Whoever comes better come with God.
They ain't going to need God, we are.
What is the trouble this time?
Your message said nothing about the others.
Dead.
Dead?
Everyone?
You got it.
Qué lástima.
They were the best.
No, second-best.
You are about to see the best.
Now, what do you got?
- Get that son of a bitch!
- Put it here.
Hey, run, baby!
Hey!
Come on!
Come on, get that ball!
Here!
Oh, shit!
He got him!
Yeah, baby!
Come on, get that ball in here!
They're practicing.
Come on, baby! Whoo!
Come on!
Look at them, huh?
You want to kill a train, here are your matadores!
Jack Strawhorn.
You say his name, the railroad cries!
Now, once a month, there's a Santa Fe Flyer comes through here.
Carries a payroll.
Big one.
Gold.
I take 50 percent of what we get and y'all split up the rest among yourselves.
You're working for me, so you just take orders from me.
You don't have to think.
I'll do the thinking.
Are you ready?
Sure, I am.
Yeah, we're ready.
Well, we'll see about that when the posse rides in.
In... but not out.
You.
You.
And with the cigar.
Now, get the rest of the men armed and yourselves... and get up there to them shacks just as quick as you can.
Hey, you really talk good, Jack.
Santa Fe Flyer, payroll in gold, chingo!
You ignorant son of a bitch, what are you trying to do to me, huh?
I asked you for men and you deliver me
cucarachas.
Two weeks, you get them.
But you gave me two days,
gringo cabrón.
What do you expect?
Joaquin Murieta?
I must be stupid.
Well, then, don't blame me!
Why do I work with you? Why?
Just give me one reason!
You're stupid, too.
And I had to leave tracks the blind could follow.
It's either me or them, but with these pitiful people...
But you make men,
Jack, I've seen you do it.
Why, in 30 days...
I don't have 30 days!
I got 30 minutes, so making is out.
That posse's right on my tail.
How many?
Six.
We're eight and two. Ten.
Pepe, you don't know those six, or who's leading them.
Who?
Come on!
Tell me, who?
Nightingale.
Oh...
Now, get this straight:
We're going to let them ride in.
That's the sluice.
As soon as they're this side of the sluice, they're in range, got it?
I want four of you in that shack over there, and four in this shack right here.
Two in each window.
From them positions we got the entire little valley covered.
When they're in range, you let fly with everything that you've got.
But not until they're in range.
Don't fire a shot until they're this side of the sluice.
Now, you got that?
Yeah.
We'll be up there on the hill.
Crossfire.
- It's going to be a clear shot.
- In you go.
Everybody take their positions.
This is going to be easy!
Let's go!
If money can make a miracle, we can have a good day.
Every day above ground is a good day.
Boy, oh, boy. It's going to be like shooting fish in a barrel.
They're here. Get ready.
Remember, now, don't shoot until they're this side of the sluice.
Now, you guys shoot from over there and we're going to do it from over here.
All right.
Dismount.
Those shanties are out of range, but let's give them a volley.
Eso es. Más cerquita.
Más cerquita.
Más cerquita. Más aqui.
Get ready.
Fire.
Hold your fire.
Let them have it!
Yee-hoo! Let's kill them!
Assholes!
Stupid bastards.
Way short.
I figure seven, maybe eight.
Spread out and go get them.
Let's go get them!
Let's get out of here!
Open up!
Somebody, help me!
Get back here, you goddamn coward!
Matadores.
Don't shoot!
No, don't...
Cucarachas.
Come on, I've seen enough.
Don't leave me!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Drop your gun.
Drop it!
Hands behind your back.
As marshal of the state of Texas,
I arrest you for train robbery... and murder.
They got him, they got him!
There he is!
How do you like it now, you son of a bitch?
You're going to get it!
Good for you,
Nightingale, you got him!
Great job, marshal.
You gutless bastard.
Now what's the headline?
"Nightingale
Captures Strawhorn."
Reset the type,
I'll get the story.
All this work for nothing.
You're not so brave now, Strawhorn.
Dirty murderer.
- You goddamn coward!
- He should be hanged!
- Somebody get a rope!
- String him up!
That yellow coward!
Please, please!
I know how you feel... but I have a job to do.
Let me finish it.
Hey, marshal, good,
I told you you'd get him!
Take him in.
Boy, you've got that election now.
Lock him up.
No, marshal, please stay there.
Let me take one picture.
I don't like being shot at, even by a camera.
All right, fine. McCanless, get your ass out of there.
Come on,
Wiley, make it quick.
Hey, mister, can I have one of those?
Of course, as many as you want.
One's enough.
All right, now, how's this?
Yeah, fine.
You people stand still there. Thank you.
Let's hear it for Nightingale!
Nightingale!
Nightingale! Nightingale!
Boo!
What in the hell happens to us when he gets elected?
Oh, Krag goes with him, the Indian goes back to the reservation.
We'll probably end up buried in a grave by the railroad.
Come on!
He'll take care of us.
Has he ever let us down?
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe he'll get us a nice, soft sheriff job, like the one in Tesota here.
Strawhorn knows spots like that all over Texas.
He'll take care of us.
I admire a man who's loyal.
Ah, but there's one thing
I admire more.
Excuse me, boys.
Ma'am?
Excuse me, but my name's John Wesley.
I'm Katherine Cooper.
Uh-huh.
My husband and I own the café.
Oh, yes, ma'am, me and my friends were just talking about the nice welcome you people give us.
No more than you deserve.
Have they arranged for the fiesta yet?
Not yet, but I hope so.
I hope so, too.
May I?
Tell you what, keep your eye on that coin and you can have it.
Blow.
There it is, right there.
You two must be the prettiest girls in Tesota.
Mr. Jones?
Would you send these wires off for me in this order:
The governor, attorney general, president of the railroad, and the Austin
Herald-Express.
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen.
Marshal, is there anything else you need, sir?
Well, as a matter of fact, I could use a blacksmith, if it's possible.
Right away.
- Oh, and a carpenter, too,
- Jed! to board up a jail cell on the train.
Send the smithy and the carpenter over to the train.
Yes, sir.
Anything else, marshal?
Oh, you haven't met Mrs. Ross.
May I present
Marshal Nightingale.
How do you do, marshal?
How do you do?
I'm so happy to meet our next senator.
Oh, I'm happy you think so.
And it's my pleasure to offer you the hospitality of my hotel.
Thank you.
The best accommodations in town.
Absolutely.
For you and your men.
Well, that's very kind of you, but my men are accustomed to plain living and so am I.
Of course, I do like to indulge myself at times.
I'll try to see to it that you're comfortable.
Mrs. Ross, I'm very grateful.
Grateful?
Sir, we're the ones who are grateful.
Yes, in fact, we're planning a little celebration for you tonight.
A tribute to you and your men.
We've arranged all the details.
And you'll give a speech.
Hold it, hold it.
I came here to do a job, not campaign for office.
Marshal Nightingale... your job is done.
Mr. Strawhorn?
Who are you?
Hellman, from the Tesota Sentinel.
Do you mind?
Not allowed.
Well, sir,
I'll stand right here.
I just wanna ask him a few questions.
You gotta get permission from the marshal.
Well, I'd like to ask him a question, then.
You got a cigarette?
Sir, I must remind you that we're in the age of new journalism.
Bless you, sir.
All right, downstairs, let's go.
Say, Hellman, tell them the truth.
Tell them I'm innocent.
A victim of circumstance!
Mistaken identity.
Could I have a light?
I don't have a match.
Eat it.
You're a nice man.
Marshal, you've got this town sewed up.
The time to count votes is after the election.
I see a lot of posters of my opponent.
Take a look around tonight.
Mm.
Newspaper's not backing me.
Newspapers don't vote.
After what you've done for this town, don't worry about it, he'll come around.
Marshal, your deputy, acting on your orders, refuses to let me speak with Strawhorn.
Now, why is that?
Sit down, Mr. Hellman.
Thank you, Wiley.
Yeah,
I'll have more later.
You do get around, don't you?
Marshal, what are you afraid of?
Mr. Hellman, we've just captured the most dangerous man in Texas.
I don't wanna lose him.
And I might knock out the guard with my crutch and run off with him?
I don't believe in leaving anything to chance.
As a marshal,
I have my duty.
I run a newspaper,
I have mine.
A very good newspaper, even if you're against my campaign.
Why is that?
Nothing personal.
You're a credit to your uniform.
Thank you.
So was I.
Oh, I didn't know you were a military man.
My commanding officer was a very ambitious man.
He became a general,
I became a civilian.
You're too ambitious, marshal.
You make it sound like a dirty word.
Now, where would this country be without ambition?
Where would your campaign be without the backing of the railroad?
That special car they provide you with?
Now, Mr. Hellman, there is nothing against public-spirited people helping to maintain law and order.
Now, where would this town be without the railroad?
A pimple on the map of Texas.
How would you vote if the railroad's interests were not the same as the people's?
Listen, Mr. Hellman, the railroad represents progress.
You can't favor progress and oppose the railroad.
I can and I do.
That's why I oppose you.
Well, I hope you won't persuade too many to share your views.
Good afternoon.
Ice-cold punch for the ladies and a little warmer stuff for the gents.
Mrs. Cooper, some punch?
Wesley!
One, two.
Here you are, boss, wet your whistle.
- There he is! There he is!
- Where?
He's coming out of the hotel.
There he is!
Yay, Nightingale!
Is he going to make a speech?
Marshal Nightingale!
I'd like to shake your hand, marshal.
How do you like the song, marshal?
Good job.
Good job, Nightingale.
Speech! Speech!
We know you won't let us down!
...see you.
Yeah, come on.
Hey, speech, speech.
Good job, marshal.
You're looking at our next senator, Tim.
You did one wonderful job.
You've got my vote.
Ladies and gentlemen, what a fine town.
Nice people.
I'm pleased to be here tonight.
Jack Strawhorn sends his regrets.
Every criminal
I've set out to capture... is in jail... or in his grave.
Am I boasting?
No, my friends,
I'm not here to boast.
I'm not here to seek praise.
I'm here to sound a warning.
The job has just begun!
Of course, there's some politicians... men, I might add, in very high office... who talk about rehabilitation, reform.
How do you reform a rattlesnake?
By petting it?
By begging it not to bite?
No, you use a shotgun.
You know, I have yet to meet a criminal who didn't try to justify his crime.
He was poor, he was hungry, no one gave him a chance.
Who among us hasn't been hungry?
Who among us hasn't been poor?
Did we sit around waiting for chances? No!
All politicians are full of shit.
We made our own chances.
But what does the outlaw do?
He doesn't believe in work.
No, no. He says,
"You work, you save."
And then he takes a gun and says, "Hand it over.
"Hand it over, everything you've worked for, everything you've saved."
And yet there are those who make heroes out of killers and looters.
When banks are robbed, they rejoice.
When railroads that unite the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans are plundered, they cheer.
But where would Tesota be without railroads and the money to maintain them?
I've been working for the railroad... ♪
And yet I know people who applaud men like Strawhorn.
Call them adventurers, highwaymen. snakes, marauding wolves.
And when you live with wolves, you learn to howl.
My dear friends, hold your cheers.
Tonight is not a tribute to me.
Tonight is not a tribute to my men, the finest posse in the world.
We wear a badge... and we're paid to wear that badge.
But tonight is a tribute to someone else who wore a badge.
One of your men,
Sheriff Buwalda.
Join me in a moment of prayer.
Thank you.
But tonight is also a celebration.
It's a celebration of the sheriff's spirit that pervades all the people of this town.
A spirit that I hope to bring to Washington to help me combat all the people who are against law and order.
The fight must go on.
But it's up to you to decide who will lead that fight.
I ask no reward for me... or for my men.
That you may walk freely tonight is reward enough.
When he goes, uh... howling back there to Washington...
If I am elected, my battle cry will be, "Wake up." where's that leave you boys?
Out on the lone prairie?
Drop those keys.
I'll swap you.
A key for a match.
I'll swap them for a bullet.
You don't reason with a killer who has no reason.
You strike him down!
Jack Strawhorn, the most notorious outlaw in the state of Texas, is behind bars.
That's not good enough.
The boss ain't going to like that.
I think he'd like me alive.
You make one more move, he's going to be miserable.
...thanks to your courage, your faith, your support.
For that,
I pay tribute to you.
Jack Strawhorn...
Don't get nervous.
...will stay behind bars until he goes to the gallows.
And I promise you that never again will he do violence to another human being.
Now, you see that?
You can be a nice man.
I do not seek high office for the sake of high office.
I want to be your voice, crying out that this country is in danger.
Your lives and your liberties are in danger from criminals who would destroy this land, this land that we love.
My dear friends,
That's my boy. your vote is my solemn promise that I will not let this happen!
...Jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow ♪
For he's a jolly good fellow ♪
Jack Strawhorn.
You've got it.
I like you.
You threw me off my timetable, but I forgive you.
Well, I appreciate that, marshal.
I must tell you, that was a hell of a speech you gave out there tonight.
Did I do you justice?
Justice?
"The most notorious outlaw in the entire state of Texas"?
Hell, that ain't justice, that's a goddamn embarrassment.
This is no time to be modest.
I got no complaints.
Can I trouble you for a match?
Hm? Sure, no trouble at all.
After all, without you, the election in two weeks...
That's it.
Can't break wind on an empty stomach. Shit.
Huh? Oh, here, here.
Come on, you little bastard.
Light up.
Tell me something.
What's on your mind?
What can I do for you?
You've already done it.
This will get me elected.
Yeah. That is the one.
Right there.
God, I am a handsome-looking devil, ain't I?
I'd even vote for you myself, marshal.
We need every vote we can get.
I'll bet you do.
Tell me something.
After United States senator, what's next on the old timetable?
The big one?
Who knows?
Well...
I regret, uh... just don't look too good for my making the inauguration.
Well, I guess we all have regrets, huh?
Yeah, I've got a lot of them.
Like trusting that double-dealing bastard of mine that you bought.
You picked him.
His trouble was, he was thinking too much. That's dangerous.
With my posse,
I do all the thinking.
They like it that way.
Thinking? You bought him.
And burned up my $40,000.
Your 40,000?
And turned my men into fried meat.
A good leader takes care of his men.
Oh, really?
You know what I regret most?
Was killing that sheriff out there in the street.
Because, mister, that should have been you.
I don't usually attend hangings.
They make me sick to my stomach.
But in your case,
I might make an exception.
Krag?
Ah, what a night, huh?
It has been fun, hasn't it?
A long time till we see another one like this one.
You know it.
That's the truth.
Gonna be our next senator.
Where are your two beautiful daughters?
They're out having a good time somewhere.
I'm sure they are.
Hasn't everybody had a good time?
Yeah.
I feel sorry for him.
God, I can't believe it.
Well, I guess we'd better round up the girls.
Yeah.
Good night.
Good night.
Do you see them?
- Hey, Nightingale.
- Good night, senator.
- Oh, what an evening.
- He's the people's man.
Back up just a little, please.
Get a picture of the marshal.
- We're all going to win.
- Next to the senator.
- Give him breathing room.
- What an evening.
Marshal, hold it just for a second, there.
Right this way, marshal.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.
- You're our next senator.
- Good night, senator.
That was a great speech.
You know, they won't leave until you come down.
By the way, this is what we call our presidential suite.
Very lovely.
Very lovely, indeed.
Compared to the plain living
I'm accustomed to.
Mmm. Champagne in the presidential suite, too?
Satisfactory?
Perfect.
Good.
But I neglected to ask the price.
When I offer my hospitality, it has no price.
You're generous.
Very generous.
Well, you don't mind indulging yourself.
Neither do I.
With someone
I admire very much.
Forgive me for asking.
But when a candidate runs for office, he has to be concerned with such matters.
How's that?
Well, what has no price, even if you want it very much, sometimes costs more than one can afford.
Well, if you can't afford what you really want, you have my sympathy.
Well, I...
I don't need your sympathy,
I need your vote.
Good night, Mr. Nightingale.
Thank you, Mrs. Ross.
There he is, he's coming out of the hotel.
The marshal's coming out of the hotel!
Good luck!
- Best of luck to you.
- Thanks a lot, marshal.
- Thanks, marshal.
- Thanks, marshal.
Watch out for him, marshal.
Come back again soon, marshal.
You'll be a senator by then.
Thank you for your help, marshal!
Hooray for Nightingale.
Hooray, Nightingale!
Senator! Hooray!
God bless you.
Hooray!
Nightingale! Nightingale!
Bye.
Yecch!
What are you feeding these horses, molasses?
You wanna hand me that, uh... hand me that broom over there for a minute?
Sure.
Very funny.
A man with a broomstick could really tear this place apart, couldn't he?
Hey!
Goddamn it!
I got a piece of horseshit down there in the corner of my eye.
Think you could come over here and get it out for me?
Well, sure. Toss it over here and I'll wash it off for you.
What a nice man.
A real nice man.
From the governor to Marshal Nightingale:
"I have proposed to the legislature
"that you be awarded a Medal of Valor,
"honoring your distinguished service
"in the capture of Jack Strawhorn.
Signed, governor, state of Texas."
"Well done.
"Can't wait to congratulate you in person.
"Signed, R. Colbin, attorney general, state of Texas."
You know something, Wesley?
Ain't that your name, Wesley?
That's it.
It sure galls me to take my last ride on a train.
It probably galls them even more.
Them train people, they don't want to give nothing away.
They give you nothing for free, not even a ride... one last time to the cemetery.
Oh, I don't figure the marshal will charge you for this ride.
Well, we'll be arriving at Austin at about, uh, 12:00.
Oh, there'll be a little celebration given by my campaign committee about 3.
I hope you'll all make it.
Be leaving this train for the last time.
The only thing I'll be taking with me is this.
A very precious memento... of the greatest posse... any man ever had.
I'm proud of you.
Trains.
What's wrong with banks?
Never hear you hitting nothing but trains.
A train whistle to me is like a bee up a bull's nose.
Only thing is, a bee just stings once.
Train people never stop.
I just figured that maybe
I'd try and even it up a little bit.
You know what I mean, tit for tat?
You sure are a character.
What's the problem?
Sir, there's something...
Sit down, Krag. McCanless?
Now, what is it?
After the election, after you leave for Washington, because we're sure you're going to get elected...
Thank you, Krag.
The men are asking what's going to happen to them.
Good question.
Here's a wire Wiley didn't read to you... from the president of the Texas and Arizona Railroad.
"Dear Howard, per your request,
"I agree to hire your men
"as railroad guards.
Starting salary,
$100 per month."
Marshal, we make more than that now.
You'll be working for the railroad security force.
They don't hire Indians.
Well, we'll get around that.
All in all, it's a... pretty good life.
If you can stand the pace and all them women.
And your luck holds out.
Forty thousand big ones burned up in the barn that night.
Forty thousand?
Plus five men incinerated.
Forty thousand.
Fire!
Get some water, for God's sake, put the fire out!
Shit!
Do you want me to burn up in here?
Oh, you son of a...
Aah! Oh!
You dirty...
All I ask is, when we split up, you go on being a credit to Texas, yourselves and to me.
Hey, Gene, come over here, look at this.
Wish me luck, Wesley!
Kiss my ass.
Haven't got the time. Hyah!
Hyah!
Here's looking at you, men.
Check the stall car.
Hey, what happened?
How did the fire start?
Get these horses out of here!
Quick! They'll burn up.
Where's Strawhorn?
Give me a...
Uncouple these cars.
Get that horse out before he burns up.
Come on.
I don't know how the hell he did it.
I don't want to hear it.
Mount up!
He went under the trestle.
All right, let's go get him.
Come on!
How did he escape, anyway?
The marshal will get him.
Now, you drop your gun!
Well, we can't keep up with a train.
- What do we do now?
- Just keep moving.
Hell, we ain't even railroad guards yet.
Come on.
Now, just sit down and enjoy the ride!
Still chasing us?
Good boys.
I like you.
Delayed my hanging, but, uh,
I'll forgive you.
No! No, no!
You stay right there and rest.
I'll run the train.
No telegram for Tesota.
Good shot.
Yep.
Had to change the whole front page.
Taking all this time...
Well, how's that, boss?
How's that?
I hope we got it right this time.
Good. Good, yeah.
I'll have the story for you in a minute.
Oh, my God!
Fire! Fire!
Hurry up, hurry up!
Get the pumpers, the train's on fire!
Come on!
What happened to the posse?
Where are the horses?
Did they burn up?
My God, it's the train.
I was wrong about you.
I gave you credit for more intelligence.
This way.
- What happened?
- Fire.
Bring a ladder!
Move it on top of the car!
Give me some pressure!
Check the other side!
Come on, pump!
Give me some pressure!
Watch out for that timber!
Mr. Strawhorn...
It's the marshal.
Hey, isn't that...?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Yes, that's him, and he's armed, of course.
What are you standing there for?
Telegraph for help.
I tried, I tell you.
It's dead, the line is down.
Well, keep trying!
He's armed?
Armed?
He's got two guns. I saw them.
What the hell's going on?
What happened?
Oh, not again.
I'd like a room, my dear.
A room?
Up there, overlooking the street.
Um, need any help with your baggage?
No, thank you, my dear.
Something to eat?
Nothing but your best, my dear.
We don't want any complaints from the marshal.
Gotta change the whole front page.
I've taken all this time.
Marshal Nightingale.
I knew he was full of shit.
Where's the goddamn posse?
How the hell do I know?
Maybe they're dead.
Wouldn't that be awful?
What do we do?
What I want to know is, what do we pay taxes for?
Deliverance from evil.
Glad to see you ain't off your feed.
Campaign takes a lot out of you.
I gotta keep my strength up.
Sorry I threw you off your timetable.
No, thank you.
You know where he's supposed to be right now, my dear?
Austin.
Telling all them good people how he's earned their trust.
I don't mind the delay a bit, Jack.
May I call you "Jack"?
Why not?
Everyone else does.
It gives me the unexpected pleasure of seeing you again.
Please.
What kind of desserts we got there, my dear?
We've got devil's food cake, deep-dish apple pie.
Stop right there.
Deep-dish apple.
How about that, Jack?
I love it.
Two deep-dish.
And a little coffee.
Here, allow me.
I'll be back in a minute.
Now, be a nice little lady and don't come back with nothing but pie.
Little trickster.
Aw, they put the fire out.
Posse ought to be coming in soon.
That's right.
I guess they've never seen you with bracelets on before, have they?
They'll know what to do.
Yeah, I bet they will.
After all, you trained them, didn't you?
That's right.
What do you want?
What do you got?
Well, it's amazing what you can do with a good lawyer.
I know some of the best.
Mm-hm.
The posse.
The posse!
There!
There they are, right on time.
They shouldn't see me like this.
Listen, how about a... a horse...
24-hour head start?
Mexico's not far off.
This is true.
I got a better idea.
You son of a bitch!
You'd risk taking a bullet rather than let your men see you this way?
Well, mister, they are going to see you.
Come on!
Strawhorn's got the marshal.
Up there.
You think you can get away with this?
You people get off the streets.
There'll be gunfire.
Oh, no!
Get inside!
Get away, get away.
Now what?
Tell Wesley to come up here.
Unarmed.
Tell him.
Wesley!
Yeah?
Leave your weapons... and come up here.
Shit.
It's open.
Now, listen to me.
I want my $40,000.
Are you crazier than hell?
It was burned.
Nothing left but ashes.
Hold it right there, that's far enough.
Now... if he's not back with the money in ten minutes... you're a dead man.
Well, how? Where the hell am I going to get it?
I don't care where you get it!
Just get it.
Banks, stores, I don't know.
Where does anybody get money?
But you'll get it.
You got nine minutes and ten seconds.
Do what he says.
Get it.
Get it.
When I get you to Austin, you better plead insanity.
It's your only chance.
You're crazy.
Wrong.
What's going on? Why aren't you helping the marshal?
Give me all the cash you got.
What?
It's for the marshal, now hand it over.
What are you doing?
Consider it a loan.
I'll do nothing of the kind.
Give me the goddamn money.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Come on!
Please, don't hurt her.
Here, for God's sake, take it.
That's all there is.
I swear. I swear it.
What's the matter with you?
Stop it! Get out of here!
Stop it!
Two more minutes.
Worried?
Some men you can trust, some you can't.
Them five I trust.
You trained them.
It's open.
Close to 30,000.
Ten short.
Well, shit, we did the best we could.
How much money you think's in this damn town?
Thirty thousand.
That's close enough.
Let's see, five goes into 30 six times.
That's, uh,
6,000 dollars apiece.
Keep it.
Return that money and stay put.
Divide it up among the men.
You hear me?
Return that money.
Go on! Divide it up!
You can't buy honest men.
Honest men stay honest only as long as it pays.
That's why I'm a thief and you're a liar.
Climbing on my dead body to get in the United States Senate.
That ain't honesty, that's horseshit.
And, mister, they got enough of that in Washington without needing any more.
Six thousand apiece.
Jesus, that's more than we make in three years.
Well, that's what Strawhorn said.
Hold it.
What does
Nightingale say?
Well, to hell with what he says.
What do we say?
I say hold it. Marshal?
Marshal, can you hear me?
Marshal!
Marshal, we're waiting for your orders!
Look out!
Oh, my God.
They shot Cooper.
Oh! Honey! Oh!
Mount up.
Marshal?
Marshal?!
Where do you think you're going?
You hire Indians?
Dismount!
Return that money and arrest that man.
Do you hear me?
Stop him!
He bought you and he'll sell you out!
Stop him!
I gave you an order, do you hear me? Dismount!
Dismount, damn you, dismount!
You're my sworn deputies.
Obey!
Rains? McCanless?
Wesley! Reyno!
Stop them!
Stop them!
Shoot them!
You spineless bastards!
Let's go.
You follow him and you'll be dead in a month!
Dead!
I'll get every goddamn one of you if it's the last thing I do!
I'll hunt you down!
I'll hunt you down!
1909: the Edwardian Golden Age.
Genteel civilization had come to England, the continent and the eastern United States.
New York rivaled London and Paris as one of the great metropolises of the world.
Albert Einstein had expounded his theory of relativity back in 1905, and science had brought us the wonders of the modern world.
Culture and refinement had arrived on the east coast of America.
Caruso was singing
Pagliacci at the Met.
Arturo Toscanini was conducting.
The Barrymores were performing and a Ziegfeld girl was the rage.
1909 in the western part of the 46 United States was not so refined.
The surviving lndian warriors were now being rounded up by the U. S. Army. ln Washington,
William Howard Taft--
300 pounds of pure
Republican-- was President and life was comfortable. ln other parts of the country, men were fighting each other and the elements. ln the New York department stores a lady could buy maxis and boots and live in style.
Out west, they didn't think about style, just living.
Eastern empire builders had secured their fortunes-- the Morgans, Vanderbilts, Carnegies.
There were empires in the west, too, such as the great McCandles Ranch.
But these huge ranches were held together only by having enough men and guns.
Notre Dame teams were playing football with end Knute Rockne catching a forward pass. ln the Arizona Territory another team, the Arizona Rangers were busy just trying to keep the peace.
Anna Pavlova, prima ballerina of the Russian ballet, was dancing Swan Lake.
The dance hall girl in the
Klondike gold rush saloon was somewhat different.
By 1909, still photographs had come to life.
Motion pictures had been born with The Great Train Robbery.
While that make-believe drama was on the movie screens nine men crossed the
Rio Bravo into Texas.
The turbulent years between the Civil War and the turn of the century brought out the best in some people but in others, it brought out the worst.
Example: O'Brien, a half-breed Apache born of a Chiricahua mother and lrish father.
A professional gunfighter-- one of the last of his kind.
Pop Dawson-- rode with the James boys in Kansas and Missouri.
Said to have murdered more than a dozen men-- one for as little as seven dollars.
Trooper-- name unknown.
A back-shooter. Considered a coward.
Reputed to have been a cavalry soldier sometime in the past but not to the personal knowledge of his confederates.
William Fain, younger of the Fain brothers.
Favors a shotgun-- a Greener-- for its bloody killing effect at short range.
James William Duffy.
At age 14, killed his first man who was an admirer of his prostitute mother.
Dead shot with a rifle.
William Devries-- young Billy.
Not quite 21.
This raid was thought to have been his first outlaw act.
Walt Devries, his older brother by 20 years.
He looks more like an lowa farmer than a professional killer.
John Goodfellow-- may be the worst of them.
An indiscriminate killer.
Women, children, no consequence at all.
Prefers to work close.
Favors a razor-edged machete.
John Fain-- sometimes peace officer and bounty hunter.
Served with distinction during the Spanish-American War.
Professional soldier thereafter.
Now between wars.
Currently banks, trains, killings and responsible for organizing the infamous McCandles Raid.
Morning, Pancho.
Good morning.
Child, you need some air.
Time to get up, Mr. Jeff.
Delilah, l'm naked. l seen you naked the day you was born and many times thereafter.
Riders coming. ls you getting up?
Yes, ma'am.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Grab his head, grab his head!
Come on, now, hold him, hold him, hold him.
Hold him, hold him, hold him.
Chico!
That boy.
Chico!
Chico!
Hey, hey, come on!
Now, l know you'd like to see Mr. Stubby ride that bronc again but go fetch me them eggs like l asked you to.
Go ahead, now.
Hurry up.
Huh...
Strangers coming.
Mr. Jeff will be a little late.
You make sure you have a half a dozen or so fresh eggs for him, Moses Brown. l've already done that, woman.
For Miss Martha. l'll take care of that, boy.
Yes, ma'am.
Why, this is ridiculous.
Breakfast, Miss Martha, nice and hot.
Thank you, Delilah.
But it's hot.
Just a minute, Delilah.
Bert, this is nineteen hundred and nine.
There... There just can't be rustlers.
Can be, Miss McCandles. l'm 42 years old, and l fought in the Lincoln County War. lt's just not that long ago that...
Why, it's just 15 years ago, himself, Mr. McCandles hung...
Your breakfast is getting cold, Miss Martha.
Some lovely flowers in the garden, Delilah. l wonder would you ask
Maria to cut them for me?
Yes'm.
You were saying, Bert? l'm just saying, Miss McCandles we're close enough to that Mexican border to...
Spit.
Yes, ma'am, that close.
And we're losing a lot of cattle.
Let me think about it.
All right, ma'am.
Oh, Bert?
There are some men riding in.
We could use some short help, if you like the look of them.
Yes, ma'am.
Hyah!
Whoa, whoa.
- Whoa...
- Try him again.
A ranch sure is a deserted-looking place during a roundup.
Can l help you men?
We heard you was hiring.
Was. But you're late.
Too late?
Afraid so.
Now, this place surely does bespeak of a great deal of money, don't it?
Anything else l can do for you?
Trouble with money, though, is that there's always somebody wants to take it away from you. l said is there anything else l can do for you, mister?
Still, that's the only problem with it, and ain't that the awful bloody truth?
Billy, you stay close to me, you hear? Real close.
No!
Run, Little Jake. Run.
Mrs. McCandles, you want that kid alive?
Don't you be a damn fool.
Hey, sonny.
- Hey, Trooper.
- Yeah!
Hyah!
Hey, O'Brien!
The boy!
Why, you mangy little...
Breed!
He's no good to us dead. l can wait.
Fain, l don't like the name ''Breed.'' l'll try and remember that.
Give me that!
Come here, you little...
All right.
Put me down!
Come on, put me down!
Hyah!
- Hyah!
- Hyah!
Get the doctor, then find my sons.
And himself, your husband? l have no husband.
Come on!
Hyah!
Take him to my bed.
Please, be careful with him.
Old Mexico!
There ain't nothing they can do to us here.
The Mexicans can.
Jeffrey McCandles, can you hear me?
This fool doctor says you're going to die but l say you are not. l taught you better manners than to make a liar out of your mother, Jeffrey McCandles.
He's just sleeping, Martha. l know that.
Delilah, there's a big red strongbox in the attic l want it.
Yes'm.
We're seeking permission from the Mexican government at the highest possible levels, Mrs. McCandles.
When we receive that permission, we are prepared to enter Mexico with howsoever many troops as are acceptable to the Mexican government and to deliver the ransom wherever and to whomever directed. l am told that there is
$1 million in that box.
Buck, what about you?
Speaking for the
Rangers or for myself?
For yourself. l got ten of my best men with me. l'd like to go after the boy myself. lf you say so, Martha, l'll take that box in. l am grateful to you both but l don't think this is a job for the Rangers, Buck nor for the Army, sir. lt is, l think, going to be a very harsh and unpleasant kind of business and will, l think, require an extremely harsh and unpleasant kind of man to see to it.
No, sir.
No, sir, l ain't.
Haven't butted into anybody's business since l was 18 year old at which time it almost got me killed.
Ain't going to start that again.
What's the matter?
Oh, what'd he have to go and do that for?
You got any last words, Scotsman?
Aye, give me my bonnet.
My head's cold.
All right, now, let's get on with the hanging.
Howdy.
Got you kind of surrounded, haven't they?
This your business, mister?
What is he, a murderer or a horse thief?
He's a sheep farmer.
Phew, that's where that horrible odor comes from.
That's right.
How 'bout the boy?
You gonna hang him, too, or just beat him up some more?
Mister, you shouldn't butt into something that's none of your business, you really shouldn't. l think you're right, friend.
A man shouldn't butt into anything that ain't his own affair.
Sheep farmer-- you want to sell them sheep?
Uh, yes, sir.
Well, let's see, l'll give you $100 now and $300 when l get them to market.
Well, that's highway robbery.
Well, maybe you think you're going to get a better offer for them today. l'll take it.
With one proviso.
What's that? l go with the sheep.
Good.
You're working for me.
You go ahead.
You go right ahead. lf there's anything l enjoy more than hanging a sheepherder it's hanging somebody who sticks his nose into my business.
Go on, you try to cut that rope.
No, you've got me scared.
You do it.
Dog!
Get him off! Get him off!
Dog!
Just who in the hell do you think you are?
Jacob McCandles.
Oh, l, uh... l thought you were dead, Mr. McCandles.
Not hardly.
You going to cut him down?
Now his hands.
200 miles south, Bar MC.
Foreman's name's Gonzales.
Tell him l sent you.
Take the boy with you.
Thank you, sir.
Come along, son. lf you follow him, l'll hunt you down and kill you.
Every mother's son of you.
Come on, dog.
Seòor McCandles!
Hola, Chihuahua.
Para usted, seòor.
Here you are, Mr. McCandles.
Thanks, Joe.
Hank!
She's in there, Mr.
McCandles, waiting.
What happened to your spurs?
Oh, they don't work on these newfangled velocipedes.
Oh.
Well, see that they get my gear out of that car.
Yes, sir.
Martha. lt's been a long time. lt's good to see you again.
You've changed, Jacob.
Not you.
You're as young and lovely as ever. l called you, Jacob because your grandson has been kidnapped.
You didn't know you had a grandson?
You have, by your son Jeffrey, and Jeffrey has been badly wounded by the kidnappers.
Will he live?
This is the ransom note.
The blood on it is Jeffrey's.
Will he live?
Yes. l would not contemplate otherwise.
Do we ha...
Do you have a million dollars?
Yes. And many times that.
Hank!
Yes, ma'am?
Will you bring in the strongbox, please?
Set it down here on the table.
That's all.
Yes, ma'am. ls this the way you want it?
Yes.
They're very dangerous men.
They've already killed ten people.
Many of them you knew.
Juan and his family...
Teena and the little boy?
Moses Brown.
Old Mose... lousy cook.
Jacob, as l said, they're very dangerous and violent people.
And l don't think we've got any other choice than to give them what they've asked for. l agree.
But you know that, pay or not, you run the risk of never seeing the boy again. l understand.
Well, ''follow the map until met.''
That's easy. l'll need food for a week, water for ten days, three packhorses and a good mule.
Waiting for you outside.
Martha, you didn't happen to think of my Greeners-- the double barrels?
Oh...
Ah...!
Oh... you brought Betsy.
Pays to be careful.
Well, now let's see if l've forgotten any...
Oh, l'll need a piece of clothing that the boy's worn recently.
His?
Yes.
Well...
Hank, who picked the mule? l did.
Pack it.
Yes, sir.
Don't forget the rest of the gear.
No, sir.
Hello, Buck.
Hello, you old horse thief. l thought you was dead for sure by now.
That'll be the day.
Thinking of taking a trip?
Well, a million dollars is a lot of money, Jacob. l thought we might go with you. ln those?
They're faster than a horse.
They'll go farther and last longer. lt's 1909, Jacob!
Meaning that my way's old-fashioned.
Meaning l'm offering my help, if you'll have me.
Well, thanks, Buck, but l'll go it alone.
Well, suit yourself, Jacob.
What about me?
James?
Good morning, Daddy. lt's been some time since l've seen you.
Ten years, l think.
Nine years and four months.
But you're welcome to come along, son. l am moved by your faith in someone you haven't seen since he was 16 years old, Daddy.
''Daddy''?
Daddy.
Daddy.
Well, son, since you haven't learned to respect your elders it's time you learned to respect your betters. lf you weren't my father...
Go ahead, l give you leave. lf you're going with me, l hope you can use that hogleg better than you can fight.
Does that suit you... Daddy?
You can call me father, you can call me Jacob, you can call me Jake, you can call me a dirty son of a bitch, but if you ever call me ''Daddy'' again l'll finish this fight.
Tiquina?
Seòor?
Tell Sam Sharpnose l want to see him.
Tell him the same place as the last time and all he needs is his saddle.
Get yourself a good horse.
Oh, Tiquina?
? Si?
Bring the horse back.
Seguro, Seòor.
Where's your brother?
He ought to be here with you.
He'll be here.
Look out for that mule! l tried to tell you about them horses, Jacob.
Now you take these here automobiles...
Jacob, this is your son Michael.
Father.
Good to see you again.
He's a mite skittish, isn't he, Father?
The little fellow's still alive, Mother.
Are you sure? l saw him.
The kidnappers were in the Chilicote flatlands,
20 miles from Coyame
Pass, five hours ago.
Using the automobiles, l believe the Rangers can get to the pass long before the kidnappers, and set a trap for them.
You want to chance it, Mother?
Buck?
No matter what happens, l think they'll kill the boy sooner or later. l've got the best riflemen in Texas with me-- that means in the world.
With luck, at say, 200 yards, l think maybe we can kill every one of those animals before they hear the shots that did it. l think it's worth a gamble. lt's very daring.
Yes... yes, l'll chance it.
What do you think, Jacob?
Suit yourself, Martha. l was asking your opinion, Jacob.
No, you made up your mind.
You made your decision alone.
You live it alone. l was wrong.
You haven't changed, have you, Jacob McCandles?
Not one bit.
Do it!
You still want me to take this box in?
Yes. lf they fail, it falls to you.
You coming along?
No. l'll go with them.
Dog... let's go! l hear him.
Sam.
Morning, Jacob. l brought the saddle.
There's your horse.
Going hunting, Sam.
- Hunting for what?
- Men. l don't hunt Apaches. l don't hunt my own people.
You remember that, Jacob.
They kidnapped my grandson, Sam. l don't know what color they are and l don't care. l have no gun.
Close or far?
Close. My eyes... no good.
Me, too.
Keep going!
Any sign of the kidnappers, son?
Couldn't see anything moving for miles.
Good, then we must be ahead of them.
There's a narrow pass at the end of the valley. l think it's a good place for us to trap them. l'm for it.
Buck, not knowing where the kidnappers are we can't chance that pass.
They're young fools.
And l'm an old one.
We're going get that boy.
We'll hide these machines up at the end of the canyon.
This is a good place for the ambush.
Jump!
Stop these damn things!
Get out!
Take cover!
Good place for an ambush, all right.
And we're it.
What happened to that crazy bicycle? l think he crashed into that canyon.
Let's get him out of here.
Come on!
They've had enough, John.
They ain't going to be able to follow us anymore.
Let's sting them a little more and they'll come through with the money.
That crazy kid.
Yeah.
The horses!
Everybody get to them horses!
Move it!
Grab that kid!
Stop! Put me down!
Damn it, Pop, the next time l tell you to tie that kid up don't be worried about hurting him.
Hyah! Hyah!
Get out of here, you...
Buck...
The boy?
We don't know.
My son Michael?
We don't know, uh...
There was an explosion southeast of here.
Well, do you have any water?
No.
Well, l'll give you half of ours.
And as soon as l can l'll telegraph that you're walking in.
Going south, it's going to be some time before you get to a telegraph station. l'm going to have to take one of your mounts, send for help.
Some of my men are hurt bad.
No, l'll need them.
Anything else?
No.
No, you've been more than generous, Mr. McCandles. l think so, Buck.
15 years ago, l'd have killed you for risking my grandson's life. lf l find him dead, l'll still kill ya.
You going along?
Well, the last time l asked you that question, you said, ''No'' and you said it in a loud and clear voice.
Now l'm asking you a question: You coming along?
You damn rights l am, Father.
Throw a blanket on him. l can ride without a blanket. l'm not worried about your butt, it's his back.
Come on.
Something down there. ls that it?
That's it.
Well, here, you take the mule down the long way. l don't want to lose him even by accident.
You go with him. l'm going down there.
You'll go where you're told.
Do this, do that. l'll do as l damn well please.
It's awful damn quiet.
I don't like it.
He don't like it either.
- Where you suppose everyone is?
- I don't know and I don't care.
As long they stay there.
Freeze.
Everybody cooperates nobody gets hurt.
What the hell is going on?
Look sharp boys.
He wants to bear loose, me too.
Did you said vamonos? You said what you said?
You still want vamos?
This is our lucky day boys, the one I waited my whole life for.
- Are you nuts?
- Yes sir, come this way. I'm not nuts, no.
Easy now, don't be too anxious, easy.
Easy now, easy, go get it.
Go get it, fill them bags.
- Fill them up high boys.
- Mostly fifty's and hundreds.
Don't take anything smaller.
Your first job, you going to be able to retire.
- Well, I'm suppose to buy that farm.
- What you going to do Bucky?
Going to Si in a rocking chair and go fishing for the rest of my life, what about you?
He pisses all the way on dames, be broke in a week.
It's a damn lie, a month maybe, but not a week?
- Mine is full.
- Mine too.
Well, there's plenty more boys, don't be bashful, in your shirt, in your shirt.
In your pantys, in your pantys.
Under your hat.
Step, step, step, this is the propitious moment.
A little shy, that's not him.
Not a person not a sound.
Maybe was son kind of an epidemic.
He says maybe is siesta.
You tell him this is the United States a we got better things to do with our... time than to lay around in our asses in the middle of the day.
- Oh, shit.
- What's the matter?
Up there.
Let's keep going like nothing was wrong.
Are you alright?
- Ah, yeah.
- Oh, what is it? Something wrong?
A Nightmare.
He said it serve you right, you didn't know that chili.
We got a busy day tomorrow, cut your cabbage,
- Buck?
- Yeah?
Think is enough money in that bank to make it worthwhile?
Yes.
- What is you dreamed about?
- Nothing.
- Mean you don't remember?
- No.
- Must've been some pretty awful...
- I don't remember.
Go to sleep.
I've never robbed a bank with a virgin before.
A double virgin, his first raid and never been thee.
- Give the kid a break,
- Don't bother me none.
Graham knows a girl who'd be glad to cure you that second one, right Graham?
- Why don't you give your ass a chance?
- That's enough.
He says he sound kind uneasy.
Easy, easy...
- How did it happen?
- Chuckhole.
We saw you at the window ma'am.
- Beautiful place you have here ma'am.
- What is it you want?
My associates and I are on our way to an important business meeting in Gladstone City.
Unfortunately, this gentleman horse broke one of his leg a few miles back.
We need a horse, got any?
We pay top money, well.
I'm afraid I don't have any horses for sale or otherwise.
- What's the barn for?
- Horses.
The couple that work for me had taken them to town for the day.
- Now, what do you suppose that is?
- We also keep cows in there, it was a cow.
I'll go have a look.
Now, if he finds a horse in there, you going to pay a little fine, for lying.
A little penalty.
- You speak Mexican?
- Thankfully no.
Well?
There's no horse in that barn.
- These some kick the stall, we all heard it.
- Like she said, it's a cow.
There isn't another place between here and
Gladstone City where we might get a horse.
So we can going in riding double.
- Looks like you miss this one Graham.
- Damn, I hate to do that.
I know, but that's the way it is, you wait here.
We'll grab a horse on the way out of town and pick you up on the way back.
Can we do it just four?
- If I had any doubts I'd call it off.
- He don't get no share.
I'll divide at four ways, those of you money giving something can.
He said he never heard a cow kick a stall like that and neither did I.
- You saying I'm a liar?
- I said nothing.
I'm just going out to that barn and have a peek... on a chance that you might've overlook something.
You take one step to that barn is the same as calling me a liar.
I can take that bank with four men but I can't do it with three.
- We continue this little conversation later.
- Whenever you like.
It's noon now.
Take everything goes right, we shall be back here at 3 o'clock.
- I'll be ready.
- She heard everything.
- I'll keep an eye on it.
- I'm sure you will.
That horse is the barn is my dearest pet, thank you for lying.
No man with an answer regards the woman would've done less.
Very nice.
The house.
Thank you.
Reminds me of the many fine mansions before the war, including my own.
- I take you were not always an outlaw.
- I was Colonel under General Lee.
Return to find my home destroyed, business... caught couple of carpetbaggers in the act... shot them.
Forced me to my present way of live, forgive me.
Oh, there's no need to apologize.
Who lives here beside you?
Sis Edna and Sam attend the place but they're out for the day, they've gone to town.
- Your husband?
- He's gone too.
- Where and for how long?
- He passed away two years ago.
- My condolences.
- Thank you.
I'm sorry to have to do this, but force of habit can tell me search the house... make sure there's no one else here.
- Understand, if you like I'll lead the way.
- If you'd be so king.
The parlor.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That leads to the kitchen.
- What sort of a room is this?
- A music room.
Though, it hasn't been used since my husband died.
Wait, just a minute.
- Where is that door go?
- The cellar.
I keep preserves in that corner and sometimes a jar explodes.
- You see?
- Yes.
Then let me go.
- Sir...
- What?
I'd appreciate if you unhand me.
My apologies.
For moment there in the dark I was transported to another time and...
- someone I held very dear.
- I suggest we resume our tour.
- How many rooms?
- I never counted.
- I would prefer do not go in here.
- Why not?
- Personal reasons.
- What kind of room is it?
- I give you my word there's no one in there.
- What kind of room is it?
A bedroom.
I don't doubt your word but if I don't see for myself I won't be able to realize.
Where is the key?
It's a shame to damage such a fine piece of woodwork.
All right.
After you.
Open those.
That one too.
- Who do this belongs to?
- Don't touch it.
- Who do they belong to?
- Belong to Mr. Starbuck.
- Who is he?
- My husband.
- But you told me he passed away.
- He did.
Then, why are his things laid out?
Mr. Starbuck died on his way from town one evening.
His things are line there just as they were that night.
They have not and they will never be disturb.
How can you sleep in that bed without disturbing?
I haven't slept in that bed since the day it happened.
And now if you don't mind I'd like to discontinue this conversation.
If you don't want to be reminded of it, why do you keep this room like a museum?
You are a beautiful woman... locked away here in the bloom of your life.
It's crime against nature.
What happened to the gentleman, the chivalry?
The first law of chivalry is to rescue ladies... in distress and I never met a lady more in distress than you.
Your concern is misplace, my life is a happy one and very pleasant to me.
Then, why are you crying?
I'm sorry, are you alright?
- I feel if I faint.
- Can I get you something?
There is some brandy in the library.
Be right back in two chase.
Glad to see you're feeling better.
Put your hands up.
First grade,
Mr. Starbuck taught me to use this gun, I learned well.
Amen.
- Your husband was a lucky man.
- Unbuckle your gun belt and drop it.
Do as I say.
Sit there.
Hands on your head.
Stop rocking.
Yes ma'am.
- If you move as much as a hair, I'll shoot.
- Yes ma'am.
If you think you make me so uncomfortable I'd low my guard... your entry is big disappointment.
- Oh boy, I've no such intention.
- Then why are you staring at me?
You told you shoot me if I move so much as a hair.
But doesn't include your eyes.
You may look where you wish.
Thank you ma'am.
- You are still staring at me.
- Told me I could look where I wish.
Anywhere but at me.
Been a long time since I slept in a bed like that.
That gray haired gentleman in the picture your father?
That gray haired gentleman is Mr. Starbuck, my late husband.
Guess my eyes are not what they used to be, I took him to be... in his 60.
He was 45 when he died.
My eyes are worse than I thought.
They provide you spectacles when you get to prison.
Do you figure out yet how you're going to get me there?
No.
My friends will be back at three o'clock and if happens they find us like... this would be embarrassing for me.
And very dangerous for you.
Well, don't worry, I'll think of something.
- You know what I think?
- No and I don't dare to.
I think you already have a plan.
I think you expect company.
I think you expect them open the door any moment.
And you just play acting with me until they do.
Think what you wish.
I don't just think it, I know it.
You know how I know it? You're blushing.
- Your cheeks are turning red.
- Be still.
- Beef red.
- Shut up.
Getting redder all the time.
- What are you doing?
- See you don't have any other weapons.
Oh, my God.
Enough.
If you're so depraved you'd inflict your desires on an unwilling body... then proceed.
I will not react, no matter what you do, I won't return.
I'm going to close my eyes, won't open them again until you're through.
- It's Reverend Cabot.
- Not a sound.
If I don't go down, he'll come in to see what's wrong.
- Does he's a dead man.
- He has five children.
- Let me go down and send him away please.
- And signal he might tray to run off.
I'll give you my word.
Like you did before, when I went for the brandy?
I didn't give you my word then, now I do.
Let me go to the door and I'll send him off... without signaling or running away, so help me god.
And you come up here on your own free will?
Well?
Yes.
Remember the five children.
- Good day Mrs. Starbuck.
- Good day reverend.
- I was beginning to worry about you.
- Was laying down.
Fact is I don't feel very well and I...
I wonder could we put our meeting to another day?
Oh, by all means, would you like that I fetch the doctor?
Oh, that isn't necessary.
- You do look a bit feverish.
- Oh, it's nothing.
- You sure?
- I'm positive.
Oh, I'll be going then, I hope you soon better.
- Thank you, I'm sure I will be.
- Good bye.
Good bye.
- Reverend?
- Yes?
- What is?
- I'll see you Sunday.
God willing, good bye.
Good bye.
The reverend is gone.
Got your chance to get away, why don't you take it?
Because I promised and I always keep my word.
Three cheers to you.
And now, if you're still your intentions to take me against my will I'll disrobe.
In order not to ruin my clothes... and to get this filthy business over as quickly as possible.
- No.
- You don't want me to disrobe?
- Nothing is going to happen to you.
- You've a change of heart, praise the lord.
I'll let you believe that.
Truth not so pretty.
- I don't understand.
- Just as well.
- Is it something you'd like to talk about?
- No.
Well, sharing troubles often lighten things.
Even if I wanted to talk about it, I couldn't put it into words.
Try.
I can't get it up.
Pardon me?
I'm incapable of an erection.
You know what an erection is?
- See, you're shock.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- No, no please, go on please.
Since seven years... since the one I loved passed away...
I'd been unable to perform a sexual life.
About a year ago, I gave up,
Resign myself to be an eunuch.
- Do you know what an eunuch is?
- I believe so.
Then we came to this house... and you appeared.
When I saw you...
I felt something steer in me that
I thought that would never steer again.
With the look of you, touch you,
I was burning with desire, burning.
And then that damn reverend knocked on the door and now the moment is gone forever.
Don't, don't...
- The only way...
- Oh, no, no.
- Let go.
- Don't give up.
- Let go.
- You mustn't give up.
Wait, wait...
Are you alright? What is it?
The feeling I had before the reverend knocked.
- Think is coming back.
- There you have, must never loose hope.
- It won't last,
- Yes, it will.
- Ah, no good.
- Try.
- I can't.
- You must please.
It's no use.
Let me try.
You try won't do any good.
How was that?
It's better, keep going.
- What's your name?
- Graham Dorsey.
Graham Dorsey, that's nice.
- And yours?
- Amanda.
That's nice too.
- Graham?
- Yes, Amanda?
- I think I am in love with you.
- Me too.
I lied to you before.
Mr. Starbuck was 67 when he died.
Why you marry an old man?
I came from a poor but prominent family in Boston.
Mr. Starbuck was looking for a wife.
Friends introduced us and voila.
Damn.
You're sad again?
Why?
First, because we only have two hours left.
Second... maybe the cure you work is only temporarily.
- I can't do anything about the time.
- And the other matter?
Graham?
Graham?
I see a sailing ship.
- Where?
- There.
You see the castle?
- No.
- Turrets, drawbridge, everything.
Where? You mean that?
Looks more like a bank we once robbed in Oklahoma.
I bet you robbed a lot of banks.
Oh yeah, a lot.
- Any famous ones?
- Sure.
I never heard of the
Buck Bower's gang until today.
Oh, that's because Old Buck is shroud.
You know, the more famous a gang is, the sooner they get caught.
So, whenever we pull a job we play it on the James's or the Dalton's/.
But they're go down in history and you'll be unremembered.
Who cares about history?
Anyhow, it's the present that counts and
I can think on a sweeter present than now.
Nor I.
If I should die this very minute, I wouldn't care a bit.
Well, if all the same to you, I'd rather live.
Which I won't be able to do much longer if I don't get something to eat.
Come with me.
Wait, just a moment.
Are you alright?
My hero.
- I'm fooling you.
- You said you were hungry, come on.
- Your husband was quiet a dress.
- Help yourself to anything you like.
I'm going prepare something to eat.
Here in the dining room.
Wow, yourself.
- Madame...
- Sir...
To those several hours which have redeem life.
I beg your pardon?
To those few hours which have redeem life.
You were saying?
To those few hours which have redeem life.
- You mind If I eat again?
- No, no please do.
- More chicken?
- No thank you.
- More wine?
- Please.
- Oh, I forgot the napkins.
- Not necessary.
We've only one hour left.
- Suddenly I feel very sad.
- It's time enough for that later.
You're right.
Come with me, come on.
- What you doing?
- I'm resuming my life.
I'll give you a hand.
- Are you ready?
- For what?
We going to dance.
Oh, why must we part?
Why can't you quit the gang and stay here?
I'm a wanted man.
We can live in Boston,
Europe, anywhere in the world.
- I don't have any money.
- I do.
Mr. Starbuck left me a fortune.
I could never allow a woman to support me.
Well, it only be temporary until you went into some business.
I know you would succeed, no matter what it was.
There is a business I always have a secret desire to be.
- What is it?
- Bank.
I'm serious, before you rob a bank, you've to study it carefully.
And over the years I become fascinated with banks.
I do have relatives in the highest banking circles in Boston.
Wow, we.
So, wouldn't you miss the gang?
I mean this relative outlaw life.
- Maybe, but I'm willing to take a chance.
- Oh, so am I.
Oh, stop.
- No.
- Please.
- No.
- Please.
- No.
- I'm going to faint.
- Fainted?
- Oh darling.
Oh, my god.
- What is it?
- I hear something.
It's Cody Taylor, he is from the next farm.
Seems in a hurry.
He's trying to get here.
You should've seen it Mrs. Starbuck.
I never saw something like it, should've seen it.
Cody, simply had to as quietly and simple as you can.
They robbed the bank, four men, at least they tried to.
But someone started to shoot and it was just a 4 of July.
Everybody blasted away and people screaming and running in every each way.
Three town people, one the robs, a Mexican kid, shot right between the eyes, right here.
And the rest of the gang, what happened to them?
Oh, they're captured, they're hang-up 5 o'clock this afternoon.
- I've never seen a hanging, do you?
- No.
And that why I stop, I'm on may way to fetch my folks...
I thought you might like to see it too.
That was very kind of you Cody.
Yeah, triple hanging and you better hurry up or you miss it.
I know how you must feel.
You don't look very unhappy.
Like they say, it's an ill wind, who doesn't benefit, some what.
- I fail to see who benefit from this?
- We do, you and me.
With the gang wipe out, I can stay here.
Well, I'm shock you take the fate of your friends so lightly.
In the outlaw game you learn to be realistic and not cry over spilt milk.
- In this case no milk is spilt yet.
- I don't fallow.
Well, they won't be hung until five o'clock, there's still time for you to do something.
Such as?
I don't know, but surely you're not going to let your friends die without raising a hand.
Hell, the nigger hits my guts and I never let eye on that kid until three days ago.
Oh, what about Buck Bowers?
You must've some feeling for him.
Oh, I like Buck alright, but not enough to commit suicide.
Which I'd be doing if
I went anyway in that town.
- You saying that for my sake.
- No.
Yes, you are.
Your heart is breaking for Buck Bowers but you deny your feelings out of love for me.
You're right.
If not wasn't for you I'd try to save them, regardless of the odds.
- Go.
- What?
Forget me and try and save them.
You'll never forgive yourself if you don't and you'll end up hating me because of it.
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will. Now go before I weaken.
- I don't have a horse.
- Oh, you can use my horse Bell.
- Your dearest pet? I wouldn't dream it.
- I insist, now go.
Be careful.
- Good luck.
- I'll do my best.
Oh my God, your clothes.
You forgot to change your clothes.
Alright now horse, you and me are going to find a cozy meadow and take a nice long snug.
Oh, my God.
Take off you clothes.
Your clothes, get them off.
Not bad, turn around.
Good day.
Can you direct me the nearest town?
You got your nerves showing up in this parts again.
Must be some mistake.
You damn right and you're the one that made it Doctor Finger...
For removing the gold teeth from people mouths... and replacing them with a cheap substitute that didn't last a week...
- I sentence you to a year in prison.
- I'm not a Doctor Finger.
Take him away.
I'm not a Doctor Finger.
How are you?
You sure have us worry.
- How long have I been like this?
- Three days.
Go, open the drapes.
What have I missed?
All the dead, town's peoples and outlaws have been lay to rest.
What about the one in the dress suit?
One of gang told the sheriff he was here... and they were heading this way when they ran into.
- Don't you have something to attend to?
- Why, no.
Yes I do, excuse me ma'am.
What is it?
Well...
That man wearing Mr. Starbucks clothes and you in that ball gown.
Plus the way you fainted at the sight of his body.
I'm not ashamed of anything I've done.
Well, that's alright for me,
Sam and the Good Lord.
But and how you going to convince all this other people?
You tell Sam to get the carriage out, I'm going to town.
- Good morning Mr. Hall.
- What can I do for you?
- I'd like some stamps please.
- We don't have any.
What do you mean you don't have any?
What kind of a post office is this?
It's a post office of the United States government.
Founded on an uncompromising respect for God and the Ten Commandments.
You got your nerve.
- She's about to shout a tear.
- The more you cry, the less you pee dearie.
- Which one give you the best ride?
- How was the Mexican?
It may be as you say.
That I deserve to be punished.
But if so, let it be for the right reason.
The man in the tuxedo was Graham Dorsey.
I never saw him before that day and I'll never see him again.
But I loved him... deeply and completely as a woman can love a man.
And I'm not ashamed to say it.
Those few hours make my life worthwhile.
I would not undo them them or trade them for anything in this world today.
But god is that happens here.
Now, do your worst.
- What happened?
- Never mind that, now start packing.
- See anything.
- Nothing so far.
- Well, keep your eyes open.
- I am, I am.
Here, let me do that, let me do that.
Here they come.
Here they come.
They're coming, they're coming.
We come in peace.
I don't care how you come, get off of my property.
Haven't you done enough to this poor child?
We are here to apologize for our behavior this morning.
Don't you come any closer.
Like the reverend said, what we done was wrong.
We don't approve the consorting with outlaws but we do admire honesty and guts.
And you showed more than you show the folks this morning.
What you said about loving him... regardless of the consequences... makes me cry when I think of it.
This is Mr. Foster, a writer from New York City.
I happen to be passing through town and had... the good fortune of hearing what you said this morning.
Like everyone else I was moved by it.
With your permission and cooperation...
I would like to do a book on the entire experience.
Share that with the rest of the world.
- I'm ordering my copy in advance.
- Congratulations.
I can't wait to read your book.
Where would you like me to start?
The very beginning.
I heard horses.
I looked out the window and I saw five riders coming along the road.
How should I know how my life was going to be affected by the one riding double.
- Graham Dorsey?
- Yes.
Describe him.
Tall, good looking.
- How tall?
- Very.
- How good looking?
- Extremely.
- Good morning fellas.
- Good morning Mr. Hiram.
- What do you got?
- You read this?
Who hasn't? Do you know the piece about that waltz where Amanda danced?
Why, you remember in the book when
Amanda talks about the waltz they dance to.
- Yes.
- Well, we put words to it.
- Let's hear it.
- Ok.

Ever hear the Union Pacific train robbery...
Te Rock Creek bank robbery, the Northfield robbery... or the Diablo stagecoach job?
Graham asked. Yes, I said.
But I thought the James brothers and the Dalton's did all those things.
That's what everybody thinks, Graham said.
But it was really us, the Buck Bowers gang.
What's so funny?
That's a bullshit.
Hey... just saw happens, I rode with Buck Bowers and his gang when they pulled some of those jobs.
And Graham Dorsey was one of my best friends.
Now, what do you got to say?
It's good enough for me.
Go on.
Our hands search each other as we laid there.
This is the most perfect moment of my life, I said.
- How much longer you got?
- 43 more days.
What you going to do when you get out?
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.
- How many sir?
- One.
That's where happened, the love story of the century.
The Starbuck mansion, where we are not allowed to enter the house...
Mrs. Starbuck is graciously consented that we might tour the property.
Don't be shy.
There she is.
The wonderful steed that trigger the events on that faithful day.
The steed that carried Graham Dorsey on that few of gallant ride to rescue his comrades.
A ride which earns him the respect of the world.
Ladies and gentlemen... a moment of silence in honor of
Graham Dorsey, if you please.
There, is where they swam... and spent an idyllic interlude, side by side, staring at the sky.
I call your attention for the 2nd floor.
Those windows are the master bedroom.
By your reaction I can see that you all read the book.
So I will not have to describe what happened there.
Look folks, you're in luck.
It's her.
- Oh and that must be Edna and Sam.
- Correct.
Good afternoon Mr. Taylor, how are you today?
- Fine Mrs. Starbuck and you?
- Never better.
- I trust you folks are enjoying you visit.
- Yes, thank you.
So nice of you to let us look about.
To be experienced what experience and not shared would be sinful.
- Would you mind?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
- You welcome.
Can I borrow the pencil please?
Would mind autographing mine too please?
- Thank you.
- You welcome.
Good day.
Wonderful woman.
Inspiring.
If you enjoy the tour, I hope you'll recommend it to all your friends.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Can I help you?
I got separated from the tour, they left without me and wonder if I may trouble you... for a glass of water before starting to walk back to town.
Of course, come in.
- Sit down, I'll get you water.
- Thank you.
Your water.
- So this is where all took place?
- Yes.
I've a confession to make.
It was no accident the tour left without me, I did it on purpose.
So that I could knock on your door and get a peek inside.
It's a long walk back to town just for that.
Well, for the privilege of... speaking you in person, drinking water from a glass you held in you hand.
I'd walk all the way to Canada.
I'm touched.
You've no idea what your story means to me.
Oh, perhaps you'd like to see some more of the house.
I don't want to impose but there's one thing I'd like to see.
It's exactly the same way you described it in your book.
Linen floors, velvet chairs...
The harp and a music player.
- It's the same song you and he danced?
- Yes, it hasn't been touched since that day.
- I don't suppose...
- What is it?
- I shouldn't ask.
- Please.
I was wondering if I may play it?
- Alright.
- Sure you don't mind?
Well, I never thought I could bear to hear that song again.
Now, for some strange reason I find myself wanting to.
May I have this dance?
May I have this dance?
Oh stop, stop please, stop.
I think you'd better leave.
And I think you had better brace yourself for a shock.
I'm shocked enough already. Now, would you kindly remove yourself from this premises.
Suppose I told you Graham Dorsey is alive, what would you say?
That you're mad, as well as vulgar.
Suppose I could prove it?
If you don't not leave immediately, I'll ring for the service.
I saw them leave.
- Hope you have a strong heart?
- Why?
Now what do you say? Too surprised to speak?
It's me, Graham.
Pinch, go ahead.
If you're through with this tasteless little joke, I'll show to the door.
No, it's no joke, I'm him.
I mean it's me, Graham.
- Yes, of course you are.
- I am Graham Dorsey.
I'm suppose to hew people like you but perhaps I can help.
Come with me, come on, come on.
Look.
- What do you see?
- Graham Dorsey.
- How tall are you?
Graham Dorsey was 6 foot 3.
How would you describe your appearance?
Inferior? Average? Superior?
Average.
Graham Dorsey was the handsomest man I ever met.
Bullshit.
Been southerner and a gentleman,
Graham Dorsey would never...
- use such language.
- I'm neither southerner or gentleman.
Obviously.
I'm Graham Dorsey.
Listen, I know how shocked you must be but I am Graham Dorsey.
Amanda... hell, I know where you are, you're in the cellar.
- I picked the flower in the pond.
- That's in the book.
- We made love three times.
- That's in the book.
- The key is kept behind the statue.
- In the book.
- Your wear lilies perfume.
- In the book.
- You had tears in your eyes when I left.
- In the book.
What you doing?
I'll show you something that's not in the book.
I won't look.
It's you.
You're him.
I don't understand, I saw your corpse.
Oh, my God.
It can't be.
I'll explain it all later, right now, there's a more important thing.
- It can't be.
- But it is my angel.
- Oh no.
- No what?
- No love making.
- Why no?
Because if, if we make love, we never be able to say goodbye.
We don't have to say goodbye, we're going to Boston, remember?
That was before, was just the two of us.
Now we have all the others to consider.
What others?
People throughout the world who'd been affected by our story.
- Oh, who gives a damn about them?
- I do.
And so would you if you read some of these letters I received.
From as far away as Japan.
Saying how much my story, our story is lifted their hearts.
Three cheers for the Japanese, now come over lie down and let's get on with the reunion.
- Don't you see?
- No.
You and I become more than ourselves.
Being more than ourselves were obligated... to support into our lesser selves to our greatest selves.
You must be talking Japanese, I haven't got the foggiest notion of what you're saying.
I'm saying, you and I must part, so that the story of our love... which many people rank with Romeo and Juliet... can serve as an inspiration for generations to come.
See this book, Principles of Banking.
I've been in prison a year studying it and dreaming of nothing but you.
Come up here lie down.,
And I guarantee in ten minutes you forget about Romeo Juliet and the Japanese.
But if people find out I take now with another man, it would...
I'm no the other man, I'm Graham Dorsey.
We're going to Boston and I'm going to be a banker.
- What would that gain us?
- A happy life?
You'd exchange a lot of fame for a happy life in Boston?
Just watch me.
Your name is now spoken in the same breath as Jesse James.
My name is also spoken as someone who is impotent which is a damn life and I'd... put up for your benefit.
You've any idea what is like to be a man known as a guy who can't get it up?
And know that reputation is going to fallow him all through eternity?
But cheerfully there it's something in exchange.
Banking would bore you, the outlaw game is in your blood.
The outlaw game is out of source.
Rotten rob, filth, rheumatism.
Now, you don't stop this nonsense...
I'm going to tell that to the world along with a few epitaphs.
Like that Buck Bower's gang was only a two bit outfit.
That didn't do any of those things I told you they did.
And I've no intention of saving them when I ran into that posse.
And I'm not the southern gent who lied about a horse in a barn to save you.
I had a dream that the bank job wasn't going to work and I wanted to get out of it.
- I believe this is called blackmail.
- I believe you're right.
- You win.
- What?
You obviously have the upper hand, it would be foolish to resist.
You going to Boston with me like we planned?
Yes.
You've given up too easily.
I try myself on facing facts... the fact here is I'd lost and I intend to make the best of it.
You're not convinced.
Perhaps this will help.
Leave this house at once or I pull the trigger.
What will these, all, all others think? Japanese?
I'd say you were a house-breaker.
You wouldn't shoot me, you couldn't.
Give me your word, you'll never return, never reveal that Graham Dorsey isn't dead.
And I'll see to it that you receive 20 dollars a week for the rest of your life.
That hurt me more that anything you could've said or done.
Fifty.
It's not just banking and you in Boston.
I...
I love you.
100 dollars a week and that's my final offer.
I wouldn't care for it was a 1000.
You mean to pull that trigger... or you go to Boston with me.
- You're bluffing.
- One of us is and I betting it's you.
I will let nothing spoil our legend, nothing.
No, no.
Oh no.
All flesh is grass.
And all the goodness there are this is the flower in the field.
The grass, withered, the flower, faded.
But the word of our god shall stand forever.
What a brave and happy face she maintain to the world.
But how her heart must've ache.
Until finally, unable to bear this life without her beloved... she decided to join him... side by side, for all the eternity.
Alright, out, everybody.
Come on, come on, hurry up.
Too lady, you too, come on.
- Red, Red Roxy.
- And who the hell are you?
It's me Graham, Graham Dorsey.
- What?
- Graham Dorsey, we rode together.
This guy thinks he's
Graham Dorsey, his a dreamer.
In case you missed it, there's a sign on that door, says private.
It's me, Graham Dorsey.
- Crying out loud, how you've been?
- Hi.
You don't seem surprised that I'm not dead.
Ah, in this business you learn to take everything as charge.
- Still like Bourbon?
- You just said one of my favorite words.
You stay here while I fetch us a bottle to celebrate your return.
Don't be long.
Graham Dorsey was 6 foot 4.

I hope that wasn't meant to be an insult against the heroic name of Graham Dorsey?
The heroic name of Graham Dorsey.
Graham Dorsey was not bigger, better looking or braver than me.
Which is to say, he was nothing but a side-winded faker and a shit.
- Pull out your arm mister.
- I already did.
I already did.
- My dearest Graham.
- My darling Amanda.
- It's almost three.
- How quickly the time is gone.
If it not for my love for you I'd... try to save Buck Bowers and the rest of comrades, regardless of the odds.
You must do it, in spite of me, or you will regret it the rest of your life.
You must.
You're right, my heart is breaking but my duty is clear.
- Farewell beloved, farewell my darling.
- That's not the way it was.
I didn't give a damn what happens to Buck and the others.
She made me go.
I'm the real Graham Dorsey.
I tell you, there's gold there, I tell you.
I've seen it with my own eyes, touched it with my own hands.
I tell you is there, gold.
All you want, just for taking.
Water is so peaceful...

Hello, Cassie! Hiya, girl. Hello there.
Let's see.
Looks like Mari's getting cards from half the civilized world.
"Mari Collingwood."
You'd think she's the only kid to reach the age of 17.
Of course, she is about the prettiest piece l've ever seen.
- Mari Collingwood, you hurry up!
- Okay!
Drill sergeant.
Did you call the repair service?
Did you tell them l was a physician and had to have a phone?
No, actually, l told them you were an international bookie...
...and l was 10 months pregnant with quintuplets.
What's new in the outside world?
Same old stuff, murder and mayhem.
- What's for dinner?
- Freezer's full, take your choice.
What's that supposed to mean?
Mari, you be careful tonight.
Your mother tells me the place you're going is in a bad neighborhood. l will, Daddy.
No bra?
Of course not!
Nobody wears those anymore.
Nobody except us drill sergeants.
But look, Estelle.
You can see her nipples as plain as day.
Daddy, don't be so clinical.
- But it's immodest.
- l'll get some sandpaper!
Young lady, when l was your age--
You all wore brassieres that made your tits stick out like torpedoes.
Tits! What's this "tits" business?
Sounds like l'm back in the barracks.
All right, then. Mammary glands.
They used to tie them up like little lunatics in straitjackets...
...and they stuffed socks in their bras.
You told me that yourself, Mother. lf God had meant women to go around with their bust exposed...
...he wouldn't have given us clothes!
Who are you gonna see tonight?
- Bloodlust.
- Bloodlust?
- Yeah. What's wrong with them?
- l was just reading about them.
Aren't they the guys that dismember live chickens during their act?
- They only did that once.
- Don't you feel sorry for the chicken? l couldn't tell you the nights l cried myself to sleep over that chicken.
- Have you seen the car keys?
- On the table. l think it's crazy.
- What's crazy?
- All that blood and violence. l thought you were supposed to be the Love Generation.
That reminds me.
- What?
- Here's a little something for you.
- Just a gift to tide you over till tomorrow.
- Daddy!
Mother. lt's nice.
Maybe it'll bring you luck.
By the way, who are you going out with tonight? Anyone we know?
- Phyllis Stone.
- Phyllis Stone? l know you don't like her, but l'm safe with her. She's from that neighborhood.
What neighborhood?
Where the concert is.
You know, from that slum. l'm sure she does.
Come on! l've got something for us.
- What?
- Come on. You'll see.
- Okay.
- Hurry up.
Who's Phyllis? You make her sound like the bride of Frankenstein.
She's the girl who takes care of the horses at the Johnson place, isn'tshe, Mari?
What worries you?
From what Nancy Springer tells me, that's not all she takes care of down there.
Mari tells me you're from Manhattan.
What does your father do?
My parents are in the iron and steel business. lron and steel both together. How unusual.
My mother irons, and my father steals.
Come on, Mari.
- l wish we had some grass.
- lt'd be nice to get stoned.
- You don't have any, do you, Mari?
- No! Of course not. Me?
Maybe we can get some before the concert.
Yeah, the concert. l wonder what it would be like to make it with Bloodlust. lt would just be really soft.
Like in a whole bunch of cotton.
You know what l mean?
- Cotton?
- Soft and gentle.
- Give me a break!
- Really sensitive, not wild and gory. God!
You're too much, man. Cotton!
- lt's Bloodlust! They're crazy!
- Like cotton candy.
The leaves are beautiful.
Yep! They're really starting to change. l guess winter's coming on. l changed. l changed this winter.
- What do you mean, you changed?
- l mean, my breasts filled out.
Didn't you notice? Look.
- They were nothing last summer.
- l didn't know you last summer.
- l know. They have.
- Congratulations!
Come on. l feel like a woman for the first time in my life.
Yeah?
Rodney Johnson!
Crazy!
The police have spread their dragnet over five states...
...to catch the fugitives and their accomplices.
Far out! This is gorgeous.
According to reliable sources...
Leave that on, Phyllis. l want to hear it.
...the daring daylight escape of the two convicted murderers...
...dope pushers, and rapists cost the lives of two prison guards...
...and surprisingly, the life of a German shepherd.
According to eyewitness reports, the animal...
...which was sent after the two men, was kicked to death...
...by a young, animal-like woman who leaped from the getaway car.
The alleged driver of the car was Junior Stillo.
Junior Stillo is the illegitimate son of the leader of the two escapees...
...Krug Stillo, who was serving a life sentence for the 1966 triple slaying...
...of a priest and two nuns.
Krug Stillo is reputed to have hooked his own son on heroin...
...to control the youngster's life.
The man is armed and considered extremely dangerous.
The second escaped convictis identified as Fred "Weasel" Podowski...
...who has a long police record for child molesting, peeping Tom-ism...
...and assault with a deadly weapon.
The three men were accompanied in their escape by an unknown woman...
...described only as young, strong, and animal-like.
Police believe the four may still be in the New York City area...
...but expect them to try to leave the state within the next 48 hours.
Thanks. Sounds like good advice.
"l'm singin' in the rain"
Sadie!
- Yeah?
- Hurry up! l want to take a bath, too.
Okay! What do you think of your new clothes? l handpicked them at Korvette's.
Wonderful.
- Who is it?
- lt's J. Edgar Hoover.
- Any trouble?
- No.
- Where's Sadie?
- Taking a bath. ls Junior back yet?
Yeah, and l'm here, too.
- Send him with my beer.
- You heard her.
Go to the icebox and get a beer.
There's a lady in there, man.
Here's your beer.
There he is. The man of the hour.
Thank you.
- You glad your old man's out of the clink?
- Sure.
You know, it's really a shame you don't get along better with Krug.
You got to change your head around.
Become someone else altogether. l've been thinking about names and everything.
How does "Agatha Greenwood" grab you?
Like something out of Brighter Day.
You're probably right.
What do you want to be?
- A frog.
- You look like a frog. lf l was a frog, l'd have my own lily pad. l could sit there all day long, just.... l could do that, man, nobody would bother me. l could watch the flies.
Better watch him, Krug!
Leave Sadie alone, you little toad, or l'll squash you flat as a lily pad.
- Do we have time before the concert?
- Don't worry about it.
Goodie! l want to have at least two scoops. l know what l'm going to have.
Mint chocolate chip.
- Mint chocolate chip?
- Yeah.
No, l don't like that.
- What's this yellow stuff right here?
- Lemon sherbet.
Sherbet. l don't want sherbet.
- Can l taste yours?
- Make your own. What do you want? l don't want that. l want....
What else do you have?
Banana Royal, Neapolitan,
Maple Walnut, Tutti-Frutti--
- Nuts!
- Nuts for the nut.
Big goon, put me down! l hate you!
Let me up.
Forget it! You've got the cream of American manhood here.
The cream of American manhood.
That's good, Krug!
Shut up! And get away from my woman.
Your woman? l thought she was our woman.
Just a minute! Buzz off! l'm not neither of yours woman. l am my own frigging woman!
- She's right, Krug.
- You shut up!
What have you been doing?
Reading them creep women lib magazines while l was up in the jug?
Maybe.
Why don't you just lay back and enjoy being inferior?
Zing off! You male chauvinist dog!
Pig, Sadie.
- What?
- Male chauvinist pig.
Okay, you male chauvinist pig!
- She's right.
- You shut up! l ain't putting out any more until l get a couple more chicks around here.
- Couple of more chicks?
- Yeah. Equal representation.
- What, are you crazy?
- She's right.
Get out of here!
God! This neighborhood's awful. lt's so dirty. My mother was right. lt's not awful, it's just funky. That's all.
Dirt all over.
Keep your eyes open for someone who might be dealing.
- Want me to ask him?
- Go ahead.
Hey, man.
You don't know where we could score on some good grass, do you?
- l don't know that stuff.
- Thanks.
- Bummer.
- Come on.
Oh, man! Lady! Come on back here.
Let's get together.
Yeah? l do happen to have in my possession...
...an extra ounce of good stuff.
- What kind?
- Colombian.
Colombian? Far out!
- How much?
$20, and it's Colombian? l need the money, but if that's too high--
No! That's great. We'll take it.
How do we get it?
- This is my roommate, Sam.
- Hiya, girls!
This is my sister, Martha.
These girls want to buy some grass.
Come on in.
- Gotcha!
- Shit!
Stick around a while. How about a bite? l'd like a little something to eat.
Nice going, junkie. Here's your yum-yums.
So much for him. l don't want you girls to worry. l mean, we just wanted some company.
That's all, you know. lt wasn't that expensive at all.
Looks good.
- This room belongs in a magazine.
- Not bad, if l do say so. l feel like a bridegroom. l'm hearing bells. l have a cake in the oven. Come on.
A cake?
You wanted some grass?
What do you want with some grass?
You guys ain't cows, is ya?
Little cows looking for some grass?
Let me hear you moo. Come on.
But they got those cute little udders on them.
You guys let us the hell out of here, or l'm going to start screaming!
You're gonna scream?
Listen.
Let me give you a little bit of free advice...
...if you make one peep....
Cockeyed as hell. l should have bought one at the bakery.
They have such pretty ones there.
Nonsense. lt's truly remarkable.
Come on in the living room. l want to attack you.
Listen. Why don't you guys let us go?
We know you were just kidding around.
We'll split, and we won't say anything to anybody. l swear.
You must think we're pretty stupid.
No.
We ain't stupid.
We might be...
...horny old pigs...
...but we ain't stupid.
- Get your hands away.
- Come on. l had her first. Please. l said get your hands away, bitch!
Chicken breast.
Phyllis!
Do that again, and you're dead.
Easy, Weasel.
We don't want to off somebody the first night out.
Be a shame to get this floor all messed up with blood.
Be so messy.
There are other ways to do things.
No!
Stop it.
Castle's ready. Here's to the princess.
To the princess!
To her queen.
Come on!
Okay, sweetheart, l'll put you right on top of your friend.
- Take it easy, you could hurt 'em.
- They're okay.
Okay, the both of you settle down, you got a long ride ahead. l'm outta here.
Yes.
- It's pretty common, you know?
- Yes, l understand.
- Sure she hasn't called?
- No, she hasn't.
- Sorry I couldn't have been of more help.
- Thank you very much. You're very kind.
Goodbye.
Nothing?
The theater manager said the concert was over at 2:00 this morning. lt's dawn now.
We'll wait an hour, then we'll call the police.
Come on! Things are not that bad.
At least we have our phone again.
She's all right. Staying out all night. lt's classic. lt's a kid's way of saying she's grown up. lt's that damned Phyllis Stone's fault.
Don't! She'll come home.
Let her have her fling.
Taking them girls, that's the kind of crime people never forgive you for.
Sex crime.
Shut up! You're disturbing my rhythm.
How did we get into this sex crime business, anyway?
My brother Sol, the plumber, he makes twice as much money as me...
...and gets three weeks vacation, too.
Shut up, shithead!
You think the cops is closing in on us? l just got this feeling at the back of my neck.
Maybe you got crabs. l wonder what the meanest, foulest, rottenest, raunchiest sex crime ever was.
Sadie! What do you think the sex crime of the century was?
Shit! l'm serious! l ought to kill you.
How 'bout the Boston Strangler? l always admired him.
- Bush league!
- l've got it!
- You sure?
- Yeah! Frood!
- Frood?
- Sigmund Frood!
Do you remember when a telephone pole was just a telephone pole?
- Yeah.
- Not anymore, sweetheart. lt's a giant puh-hay-lis.
Puh-hay-lis? l can't even look at the Grand Canyon anymore without crossing my legs.
That's bullshit.
This icing is delicious.
You must get a lot of hysterical parents calling you now, Sheriff?
- lt's not that unusual, Mrs. Collingwood.
- Oh?
We've gotten lots of calls like this in the past few years.
Kids running off to the big city for a few days.
Our chances are that Mari will be back before supper.
Still, it's wise of you to call us.
At least all our phones are working.
That's just great!
We're a million miles from nowhere, too!
King car of the road!
- All right, what's the matter?
- lt stopped! l think l've found the trouble.
This thing pulled out, and it's all covered with oil.
Christ, didn't they teach you nothing in reform school?
Take it easy on him, he's just a kid. l know, but when l was his age, l could fix any car in two seconds.
Hey, Krug. Where the hell are we? l just have the strangest feeling we should be doing something more.
Now, hold on.
My deputy Harry, he's down there in the radio car.
He's calling New York right now.
And if we hear anything....
Here he is right now.
What did you hear?
New York police don't have anybody of her description...
...in jail or on ice. lt's their term.
Guy in the morgue says he hasn't had a kid on ice all day.
First time in five years. ls that the last of the cake?
There's a tool kit in the trunk. l want you to start this goddamn car.
Bitch! She bit me!
This ain't getting us out of the state.
She bit me! That bitch bit me!
Weasel, we're gonna have a little fun.
Car's on the blink, Weasel.
- No.
- And while we've got you brats along....
What are you gonna do?
We ain't going to be able to call a mechanic, go to a gas station, nothing.
We'll get the phone in service so we can get a call from her. lt'll be all right.
Kids get ants in their pants sometimes.
She's just letting off a little steam.
Come on, there!
Dig these crazy woods here.
Come on, Junior.
Move it.
Go to the right, down by the water.
- Who do you suppose that is?
- l don't recognize it.
- Looks like someone got stuck.
- Want to go have a look?
No. Come on, let's go, kid.
We've got more important things to do.
That ain't going to find us
Mari Collingwood.
Weasel, take out your knife. l'm gonna tell this little lady here to do something.
And if she doesn't do exactly what l tell her to...
...l want you to cut her...
...friend.
Oh, brother!
- Untie them.
- Come on.
He's talking to you.
Come here.
Piss your pants.
Piss your pants! l said, piss your pants.
You sick mother!
Phyllis, he cut me.
Piss your pants.
Do it!
Watch her pee.
She's doing it.
Look at that!
Oh, God! Hell!
That's beautiful.
Now, take them off. l said, take them off!
You're so sick!
Yeah! Take them off!
- l told you about her.
- She's got lovely legs.
This is really a riot, man! l dig it!
- Take them off! Take it all off.
- She got her little panties all stained.
Can we get Weasel a pair of those pants?
Do you want a pair of those pants, Weasel?
How about some with a couple of hearts on them?
- She's got a good-looking ass on her.
- Come on, we're going to play. Up we go.
Hit her.
Hard!
Sock it to her, baby. l said, hit her. l'm sorry, Mari.
- ln the stomach with all your might.
- Stop it!
You're gonna kill someone if you're not careful.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, shit!
You guys got to be crazy, man. lf you're not careful, you're gonna kill someone.
Make them make it with each other!
- That's a good idea!
- Make it with each other.
Too sick, man.
Loosen her up a little bit. Wait a minute.
Come on. Don't worry about it.
You'll have plenty of time to feel the pain.
Weasel here is a specialist with a twist.
Do it!
Get it off!
Leave her alone!
Come on.
- We've got to do it.
- l can't. l know it's sick.
But it's okay. lt's sick. But it's okay. lt's just you and me here. Nobody else.
Just you and me, okay?
- lt's all right. We're not going to hurt you.
- You already hurt her!
What do you think you're doing!
No, Doc Collingwood, still no word on Mari.
But we'll letyou knowjust as soon as we hearsomething.
Yes, sir. l'm glad you got your phone fixed.
You just stick right by that phone
'cause she might call.
- I'm holding you personally responsible.
- Yes, sir.
- Call me if anything comes up.
- Okay.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
Hot damn, l wish l was something else sometimes.
You mean, like a duck or something?
No, you damn fool! l mean something else besides being a policeman.
Doc Collingwood again? l bet she shacked up with Wilbur Cranshaw.
That shows what you know.
Wilbur's gone up to Coopersburg with Sweet Lily.
- Who the hell is Sweet Lily?
- lt's his pig. He went up to Coopersburg.
He's gonna enter her in some fair up there.
Wilbur always was a little strange. l remember he left town real sudden once before.
Just before his collie came down with a litter of pups. l'm going up to the car...
...to see if l can find something to cut some firewood with.
Firewood?
You know. Heat things up a little bit.
You can handle things while l'm gone, can't you?
Sure.
Listen. l'm really cold.
Would it be okay if l put on my clothes?
Just till Krug comes back. l'm really cold.
Okay?
Go ahead.
Listen. l'm gonna make a run for it.
When they go after me, you go and get help. Okay?
Okay.
You want to play? Junior!
Watch that other girl.
Don't let nothing happen to her. l'm going to get you!
Man. l've got to give up cigarettes.
- Shut up!
- Junior? ls that your real name? l told you to shut up, or l'll slap you silly. l'm gonna give you another name. Willow.
Willow.
Because you're kind of beautiful, and you shake when the wind blows.
- Krug is the wind.
- Let me alone.
Krug's gonna really be pissed off we lost her.
Split up, okay? Go that way.
You bitch! Slow down!
Willow, do you have a girlfriend?
Sure, l've got lots of girlfriends just waiting to get me.
- l don't think you do.
- You're right.
- l want to give you something.
- l don't want that.
- lt's worth a lot. See?
- l don't want it.
- l want to be your friend.
- You want to get free.
- l want to be your friend.
- Where'd she go? l want to be your friend. l can get you a fix.
- You can get me a fix?
- You'd like that.
- l'd like it.
- Sadie! Over there!
My father, he works with addicts.
He's got it in his house. lt's here. l can get you methadone.
Just as quick as that.
Really! Come on, let's get out of here.
- What, are you crazy?
- l live over there. l live across the street. Come on, please!
- l can't leave! Krug will kill me.
- Not if you're not here.
Row, creep!
Son of a bitch.
Attention all townships.
We got a late bulletin on the fugitives...
...Krug Stillo and Weasel Podowski and their two accomplices.
State police got a gas station attendantin Riverdale.
Says he gassed them up and gave them directions to Corrington.
- They're up our way!
- Boys downstate reckon they...
...might be coming our way, heading for Canada.
Once again, description of that escape vehicle as follows...
...dark green 1958 Cadillac convertible...
...bearing license plate number E2546.
Repeat, Edna 25....
How long does it take to get to there?
- About 25 minutes.
- Make it 15. lf you would just relax, listen, l can help you. l'll get you out of this.
- You stupid dyke!
- Sadie! l'm gonna kill you.
- You all right?
- l'm okay. Let me up.
Come on! There she is! l'm gonna kill that bitch.
- Feel better now?
- l'm okay.
- How did she get so close to the road?
- She threw some dirt in my face.
We caught her.
What are you worried about?
Goddamn car stopped.
You're out of gas, you idiot!
Out of gas?
God damn!
See. l told you she wasn't going far.
How's your back, baby?
- Phyllis!
- Oh, Christ.
Junior!
- You said my name was Willow.
- Willow, then!
You've got to be a man and do something for once.
What would you do if you were me?
Fuck!
They're coming after us.
Going somewhere?
Phyllis?
Did she get away?
- Pigs! Get outta here.
- We hate cops!
God damn!
Damn hippies!
What do you think?
"K-R-U-G.
"Krug." That's really nice.
You're gonna get yours.
You are really gonna get yours.
Little woolly.
"Now l lay me down to sleep
"l pray the Lord my soul to keep
"lf l shall die before l wake
"l pray the Lord my soul to take"
Junior!
Go up to the car and get the suitcases.
Let's get washed up and the hell out of here.
Let's do that.
Good grief. We've been walking for nigh on an hour now. lt's 7:00 and we've still got a good 10 miles to go. lf you've got any better ideas, you just come right out with them.
'Cause l can't think of any other way to get from here to there...
...or any other place either, without riding or walking.
And since riding is out, thanks to you, you lame brain...
...then walking is the only thing that's left.
Listen.
- What?
- l hear something.
All l hear is you, you damn fool.
Who the hell do you think you are? Tonto? lt's a truck.
And some chickens, too.
Chickens? l only tell you what the road tells me.
Listen, Ada, we've got a problem here.
This is serious business.
We've got to get to the Collingwood place right away.
This is police business, and this is an emergency, you hear?
- Can you help us out?
- Have to ride on the roof.
- On the roof?
- lt's the only place l have any room.
Fasten your seatbelts!
Proceed. Now listen, Harry...
...if you tell any of the boys at the lodge about this, l'm gonna fix your wagon.
God damn.
- What in thunder's goin' on here, Ada?
- lt's got its maximum load. l couldn't get another chicken on here without it stalling.
And now l've got you two on here, and you two ain't chickens!
This truck won't start with us on it?
- You said it!
- Listen.
You're gonna have to take some chickens off that truck and let us on.
- How much do you weigh, Deputy?
- 185. Why?
- How much you weigh, Sheriff?
- About 180.
Bullshit.
Maybe 190. l don't weigh myself every morning.
That's 11 crates of chickens.
And that ain't hay.
Now look.
You know l'm a solemnly sworn officer of the law? l got the law on my side.
And l got the chickens and the truck!
Water!
You found water, chief.
- Still got some in your eye.
- You get it.
How's that?
Did l get everything?
- Am l clean?
- Help me out of here.
- Am l clean?
- Yeah.
Atta girl!
- Have a look, Sadie. ls my tie okay?
- Beautiful, baby!
- Gee, thanks!
- You're welcome.
- John!
- l'm in here!
We've got guests.
- l'm sorry.
- Guests! Who is it?
Get your foot off the table!
Being in this house makes me wish l was a lady.
This place is in the middle of nowhere, you know that?
- What are you doing with the Holy Bible?
- "Dearly beloved, we are gathered here...."
- Weasel. What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Who in the world is it? l didn't know anyone was coming over.
John, l want you to meet Harvey Wilson and his wife, Dorothy.
- How are you?
- Sam Hardy.
- And Dave Rizalski.
- David.
Do you know their car broke down right out front?
- Anything serious?
- l'm afraid we blew a rod.
- Oh no.
- Willie's Esso station is the only garage...
...l know, and they close at 6:00. lt wouldn't make any difference.
The phone is still dead.
They wanted a ride to a motel, but l said...
- ...that would be up to you--
- Mari still has the car. lt's okay, we've got plenty of room.
Why, we have a perfectly good guest room.
And there's Mari's room, l suppose.
Are you sure we're not a bother to you folks?
Nonsense! Our home is yours.
Let me get your bags.
No! Jun-- Frank, here, is...
...younger. He can handle it.
Why don't l show you to your rooms?
Come on.
Here, and through there. Okay? l'll put some towels in the bathroom for you, and you can wash up if you like.
- Bacon and eggs in the morning?
- Thank you. Marvelous.
Well, we'll be in the living room, and you can join us if you like.
- Just make yourselves comfortable.
- Much obliged.
Come on!
Very nice.
The lady of the house is nice, too.
- Krug. l want my fix, man.
- Go jump!
- Krug?
- Yeah?
Look at this.
What?
Guess who lives here? l wonder what the odds are on that.
Feel like playing "Three-Thirds of a Ghost" or something?
How would you like me to put my boot up your ass sideways? l'm sorry l don't have anything better to offer you, but....
- lt's been such a confusing day.
- Hell, you've got a lot to offer.
This food is impeccable.
Are you folks on vacation?
- No. We're sort of on a business trip.
- What sort of business are you in?
- Plumbing.
- lnsurance.
Well, which is it?
You see, we're actually in both.
We sell insurance to plumbing companies.
You know, in case they steal some toilets or something.
Junior....
Stop it!
WillowI
You're gonna kill someone.
Willow.... l'm sorry.
You don't mind if l smoke, do you? l'm sorry!
Shut up, you little creep! l should've killed you at the lake!
Shut up!
You're worse than your goddamn mother!
You see, Dave upstairs, he lost one of our biggest accounts last week. lnternational Bathtub and Sink.
$500,000 account, down the drain, so to speak.
He kind of takes all the blame on himself.
Hasn't got over it yet.
Any more spaghetti left?
Goddamn high-class, tight-ass freakos.
All that goddamn silverware.
Who do they think they are, anyway?
People in China eating with sticks...
...and these creeps got 16 utensils for every pea on the plate.
Take it easy. lt don't make no matter, one way or the other.
Where's that goddamn son of mine?
He's taking a piss, or something.
Did you get him his fix?
Screw him. ls there anything l can do in there?
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. l'm fine.
Let me call my husband. He's a doctor.
No, lady, please! l'm all right.
Easy does it. You okay?
Nuts!
- What the hell you been doing?
- Nothing.
Look, man! l've got to have a fix!
After breakfast.
- Krug.
- Yeah? l want my fix, man.
Look, man! Cut it out!
- l've got to have a fix!
- Screw off.
Krug, we gotta get out of here!
- lf they find out we killed their kid--
- You shut up!
Or you'll wind up in the lake with her.
- God, John.
- Jesus Christ! lsn't there anything we can do for her?
Nothing.
She's dead.
My baby!
Baby.
Don't move. Open your mouth, please.
Don't move.
Open your mouth, please.
- Light.
- Light.
- Chisel.
- Don't move. Chisel.
Hammer.
Hammer.
Wider now.
Wider.
Don't move.
No good.
Hello.
What are you doing up so late? l thought l heard noises.
But it was just a dog in the garbage can outside. l got a little hungry.
Thought l might raid the icebox. l must say, you....
You do look like a man with a huge appetite.
All that spaghetti tonight and everything.
That's true.
Where's your husband? l couldn't help noticing that your room was empty.
He's there.
He somehow finds me too hard to....
- Well, he's afraid of me.
- You're kidding. l only wish l was. l could make love to a looker like you with my hands tied behind my back.
Let's go over to the couch.
No!
John might hear us and come in.
- Why don't we go outside?
- Outside?
Please. l want you.
Let's go outside. l've always dreamed of a man who could take me easily.
Almost like you said...
...with your hands tied behind your back.
Baby, believe me, l can literally do that. l'm so super.
Goddamn it.
Here.
Tie me up. l couldn't! l thought it was just some girlish fantasy. l know no man could do that. l said, tie me up.
Well....
Now you just unzip me, and that's all l'll need you for.
Okay.
You got it caught.
On your little thing! How did l do that?
Shall l just give it a little yank?
Don't do that! Just ease it down.
Nice and easy.
That's it.
Poor little fellow. lt's not little.
You just scared it, that's all. Just wait. lf you don't watch it, l'm gonna come.
Please come then, sweetie.
Don't you want me to do you good and proper?
You can do both...
...can't you?
Hell, yeah! l can come five or six times if you want me to.
You bitch. l think l'm gonna come.
Are you sure, my love?
Sweet mama!
Here l come!
- What's going on?
- l don't know. Shut up. lt's Weasel.
What the hell has happened to him?
- What's the trouble, Doc?
- Shut your filthy mouth!
Now, take it easy.
Don't do anything l wouldn't do.
Put the lights on!
Son of a bitch.
Boy.
You can do better than that, come on.
Right here.
You're almost as good as Sadie.
Why don't you get something to help you?
Maybe one of the andirons or something.
You know?
Let's even up the odds.
Who's this? Hello, there.
You remember me?
Come on.
We're just playing games, now.
We're just beginning.
And what did you do with Weasel?
What did you do with him?
Hello.
What's your name, little angel?
Mari.
She was a lot tougher than you were, Doc.
She took a while to kill.
She was really tough.
We had a hard time with her.
But you're just a pussy!
A real pussy.
Come on, now.
You can do better than that.
Just a couple more.
Maybe one more for me.
What the hell are you doing?
You wanna kill me.
- l'll do it.
- Let me help you. l really will. l want you to hold the gun out just like that, see?
You see that little notch in the back?
That little bump in the front? l want you to kind of get them lined up.
That's right.
You're not shaking that much. l know you can aim the gun.
Just get them lined up, and pull the trigger.
Come on. Pull the trigger.
- l'm gonna kill you.
- You always were a loser.
Junior...
...l wanna talk to you.
Listen to Daddy. Come on. l want you to take the gun...
...and l want you to turn around...
...and l want you to put it in your mouth...
...and l want you to blow...
...your brains out!
- No!
- No. Not at me. l want you to take the gun, and l want you to put it in your mouth...
- ...and l want you to blow your brains out!
- No!
- Blow your brains out!
- No!
Blow your....
Sorry, Krug.
But l could only find one shell.
- Get that guy out of here!
- Sadie!
Get away from me!
You're not going to get away from me!
Get off of me!
Let's just get it over with!
John! For God's sake, don't!
Ready?
Ready?
All right. Drive slow.
Stay in formation.
Sorry about that.
Don't have to apologize to me.
Three and a half. Seventy-five?
Now four. I got four and a half quarter.
Now a half.
Four and a half and seventy-five.
Now five. Five...
Seventy-five. Sold to the party in the corner. T and C.
Let's roll them, boys.
Bring the next package in.
And here we have the first package in...
Those your calves, Uncle Herb?
Yeah, every one of them's mine.
Where did you get them?
Crossed them from Mexico.
I got 30 appaloosas.
Appaloosas?
- Studs and mares.
- You got yourself some stock there.
- Yep.
- Hey, Jim.
- I've been trying to reach you all morning.
- Yeah?
- Well, they tested out your animals.
- That's good.
Yeah, but the four best ones have dourine.
It's about the same as clap.
- Dourine?
- It's clap.
Damn.
Well, I shot and burned the four of them and I cleaned out all the manure.
- You owe me $30.
- How long will the rest be in quarantine?
Six weeks.
You have to wait for your money then.
Well, make it easy on yourself.
Hey, where did you get them?
In a cathouse?
You know, Jim, you could sit right here in my place and do my bidding for me.
I get tired of coming out here.
Seven forty-five and a half.
Seventy-five. Now eight.
Thank you. I'll think about that.
I got problems with my own operation.
Now nine. Now forty-eight.
Yeah, I gotta see a man about a loan in Tucson.
- I'll be up there later on tomorrow.
- Okay.
Hello, Mr. Kane.
How are you?
He told me about the quarantine.
I'm awfully sorry. What was the matter?
- It was the dourine.
- What's that?
Listen, it's no worse than a bad cold.
I think he can see you now.
- I'm Jim Kane.
- You don't have to tell me.
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
Well, we're having quite a day.
I don't know about that.
I got this note coming due pretty soon.
The day after tomorrow.
See, I don't know what's gonna happen about that because I'm not in the chips.
I don't even have a nickel.
Maybe you could just pay the interest on it.
I don't have a nickel.
I guess we can carry another 30 days without the bank falling on its ass.
No, it's six weeks.
- Six weeks?
- My quarantine's six weeks.
Fine, then.
- Well, I appreciate that.
- Yeah.
Look, maybe next time you could stop farther south...
...and bleed them yourself first.
Or maybe test them before you buy.
Well, I guess.
There must be some way of doing it before you get to the border.
Well, I'll just sure keep my eyes open.
Which is what you're saying, I guess.
Well, I'll see you in six weeks, then.
- I'll be here.
- All squared away, as far as I can see, Jim.
Okay.
Well, hi, Jim.
Where you been hiding?
I haven't been hiding.
I just need a room, is all.
Fine.
I need it on credit too, because I owe Will Orr $30.
Well, you can have the maid's room, top floor.
You can understand that I gotta have a roof over my head.
- Of course.
- Got to be good to myself too, you know.
You know, I been thinking about what you were talking about and then it hit me.
You see, I don't know how to bid.
Oh, you learn real fast.
Well, I can learn how. But when?
I mean, if you gotta sit there all the time and tell me when...
...you might as well be doing it yourself.
How are you two dudes doing?
- How are you, Stretch?
- What do you say, Herb?
Yeah.
Listen. Somebody I want you to meet.
Won't take but a couple of minutes.
- Well, who's that?
- He's a friend of mine. He's in the know.
He's downstairs with a car.
I told Stretch I'm not about to talk business up there in the club.
I'm not about to tip my hand for everybody to see.
Jim, this here is Bill Garrett.
He's a big buyer from Amarillo.
Flew here this morning in a Cessna.
I've been in plenty of clubs with flocking on the walls. Glad to meet you.
Hey, Bill, he got himself a moniker too.
Oh, what's that?
They call him a Chihuahua Express.
Oh, they call you that, huh?
No, Stretch does.
- Well, that must come in handy in a row.
- How do you mean?
Well, I mean, a guy figures that you're the Chihuahua Express.
Like that.
They could also think that
I was named after that dinky dog.
I'd like to step right in here and say, ain't nobody gonna think...
- I don't care what anybody thinks anyway.
- Let's just drop the subject.
I'd like to buy me some Mexican cattle, Mr. Kane.
I'm talking about rodeo cattle.
How many?
About 250 head is how many.
They tell me the best, they're running down around Rio Alamos in Sonora.
- Yeah.
- Jim...
...it pays $2 a head commission, plus expenses.
Now, when did you ever see that kind of money before, huh?
- Well, I've seen...
- I'll give you the money to buy them.
Part now and part later.
Of course you get your commission when you bring them to Hermosillo.
Then I need my expenses up front too.
- Well, you're gonna get those.
- You'll get everything.
How soon do you want them?
Well, I'm gonna say four weeks.
But if you could've had them here yesterday, I'd be happy.
- What, are you staying here in...?
- Motel.
Out in Samoa.
Well, look, I'll let you know tomorrow.
- He wants to let us know, Bill.
- I may be leaving for Chicago at 4.
- Oh, yeah?
- You let me know in the morning.
Well...
I'II...
Okay.
I don't know exactly what to tell you, Jim.
I can talk all day, but I gotta make some money.
You go to work for that dude and you're gonna have problems.
You see, he was... He was friendly.
He's a hustler.
But you gotta go by your first impression.
- What did he want?
- Some rodeo cattle out of Rio Alamos.
You'd be better off breaking pisshead colts than you would working for him.
Well, it's a job, Uncle Herb.
I'm not talking about a career.
You can get a job breaking pissheads.
Frank Spring's got some.
- Nope. Closed him out.
- Really?
- Couldn't get insurance on himself.
- Well...
He ain't busting a pisshead one.
They just closed him out.
Still I wouldn't get in bed with that Garrett whozis.
Well, I'm not gonna get in bed with him,
I'll say that much.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I had to make a couple of business calls.
Well, that's all right.
- I met a fella.
- Yeah?
- Well, that's not the end of the story.
- What is the end of the story?
Well, you're a cheater, he says.
You're not all that honest.
You got an opinion about that?
Well, I got a private view.
What is this private view?
- Well, I think not.
- Well, why did you ask, then?
You gotta trust your first impression.
Well, fine.
Fine.
If somebody cheats me,
I'll hit him with a Stillson wrench...
...and shove him down a culvert.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
You talk that way, intimidating...
...and I'm gonna move on down the line and not even listen to you.
- You talk like that and...
- Well, listen, I'll stop, then.
I gotta go and see a guy.
I leave at 4.
I'll be right with you.
Is your friend pushing a lot of hamburgers in there?
Hi, Jim.
Hey.
You wanna do a nice thing?
What?
Well, I can't pay my alimony.
You're gonna make every payment.
Well, I don't know about that.
Well, I've got confidence in you.
You see, what I came down here is that
I think we can be more friendly.
No, l... No, I can't be any friendlier with you.
It's okay. We used to be married.
I don't see why not.
I'm as good as that rummy in there.
How do you know so much about him?
Because I hired a private dick.
- Oh, you tell me that. I don't believe you.
- No, that's true.
Jim...
...you're a baby.
- I don't know about that.
Well, I can't be expected to get back together with a baby.
It's impossible.
Hey, sug. We got people around here who'd like to eat today.
Hey, Jim.
You take care of me, you hear?
Hey!
I'll take your cattle, what the hell.
- You mean you'll pick them up?
- Yeah.
Well, that's my fender you're kicking, hotshot.
- You watch out about my fender there.
- I'm sorry about that.
- Well, you wanna be careful next time.
- Okay.
Chip that paint, that yellow,
I'll never get a match.
- Well, I need some money for my expenses.
- I understand that.
Hop in. Come with me.
Come on.
I've gotta have your name.
It's regulation around here.
You ought to get yourself one of these.
I got one.
Been happy ever since.
You got the rest of the bank drafts here.
I'll take real good care of your cattle,
Mr. Garrett.
What seems to be your trouble?
Do you want anything with him?
Yeah. I'm looking for a guy by the name of Leonard, but you're not him.
Well, who are you?
Well, I'm a friend of his, first place.
Well, he's right up there.
But you better leave him alone.
No, he'll be glad to see me.
He says not to bother him.
Well, I don't care what he said.
Who's that?
Well, it's Jim Kane, Leonard.
Oh, Jim, I'm sick as a dog.
Well, you don't look so good.
You shoot me, you'd be doing me a favor.
- I don't think that's necessarily in order.
- Well, maybe not.
Maybe you're right.
Well, I thought you was off somewheres.
Yeah, well, I was. For a while.
You looking for more horses, huh?
No, I'm looking for Corrientes.
Some people want them for rodeo purposes.
Horses, stock, it's all the same thing, huh?
I had an idea that was what.
You sure got a great mind, Leonard.
Well, I don't know about that, but...
- I got contacts.
- Well, what are you up to?
I got a land deal on the back burner.
Oh, really?
Well, I don't have the land, but I got the...
You know, the option is the same thing.
Well, now, where is it?
Well, I just don't necessarily tell everybody about it.
You can tell me. We're good buddies.
Oh, yeah.
Two peas in a pod.
Well, I need your help, Leonard, which is why I come down here.
You know me, Jim.
That's fine.
I'm gonna need me some corrals first.
You got any leads on that?
Hey, Juan, you're making some noise down there, huh?
Well, I'm having a good time.
You go ahead, have a good time.
I'm not about to stop you.
I'm having a good time and I'm not gonna stop.
You have a friend from the United States.
Oh, yeah. This here is my friend, Jim, from Nogales.
- He come down here to make a few bucks?
- What?
You come here to screw a few Mexicans?
Juan.
Hey, you got it right there, friend.
I come down here to steal a few chili peppers.
Jim.
We have to be especially nice to him, otherwise he won't be nice to us.
He's the son of the big turkey down there.
Hey, Juan, he wants to rent some pens.
He'll have to pay for them.
He's a businessman, Juan.
He knows that.
If he wants them, he's gonna have to pay like everybody else.
I'll tell you what, if he don't pay, don't rent him the pens.
I don't know what's coming next, but I'm not even listening.
- Wants to know if you'll mess with him.
- I don't wanna mess with him.
I'm here, is all.
I'd advise you not to spit around here.
You might hit a sucker.
Hey, are these pretty good pens?
I like them.
You only say when you like something, huh?
That's right.
Well, listen...
...I'm gonna take your word on this.
This one time.
I'd like you gentlemen to try one of these.
They are my favorites.
Thanks, Don Tomas.
We're having a good time.
And that's what's important.
That is good.
Excuse me.
I'm not having a lot of fun eating tortillas.
You dropped your thing on the ground.
Because I come to talk business, Leonard.
Them pens or cattle. One or the other.
You ain't gonna have any trouble.
Hey, Juan.
Tell this gringo how you'll fix him up nice.
- I'll take care of him.
- Well, come on.
Come over. Tell him you'll fix him up nice.
- He won't have a worry in the world.
- He'll be just fine. Just fine.
See, I don't deal much with cattle.
- Which is why I need a good set of pens.
- What kind of cattle?
Corrientes. Two-year-olds.
What about yearlings?
I have yearlings for sale.
Can't use them.
I know a fella that can, but it's not me.
- Why not?
- It's a question of what he wants.
There's nothing the matter with the yearling.
Well, why not, then?
The horns are too short, first place.
You buying horns?
Oh, you betcha.
- You're in the horn business?
- That's right.
Goats have horns.
No, thank you, though.
Then what do you want with horns?
I like to stick them in things.
Well, listen, you know, you can talk all you want...
...but I'd give you 1200 pesos for those corrals.
And I could not take less than 1500.
- Used them myself for a thousand.
- That's true.
He could take less, Jim.
It's only that he doesn't want to now.
That's true.
Well, I'll meet his price, then.
He's gonna be a happy fella.
I'm satisfied.
Leonard, come here.
You're not getting a kickback on this, are you?
You're a horseman?
Yeah. I'd ride anything.
Even ride an armadillo.
A bucking horse too?
You're telling me.
You'll ride one of ours?
Now?
Yes, ma'am, if it's bareback.
They sure take care of her.
Don't let her do much.
Yeah. She must be the queen around here.
Remember, Leonard,
I got a belly full of tortillas.
You're gonna be sitting on a buzz saw.
I won't be sitting on him long.
You wanna look good in Mexico, you hang on as long as you can.
Yeah.
I think I'll just settle this animal down a little.
Nervous.
Thank you, Leonard. I can't see a thing, Leonard. No withers.
- He's got withers, you just can't see them.
- Okay.
Get up.
It's too bad your wife couldn't join you here.
Oh, yeah. Well, that'd be fine except...
...she had her fill of me and we're busted up now.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, we're divorced, if you wanna use the technical term.
- Well, I'm sorry.
- That makes two of us.
You know, I travel a lot, and I go places and I guess...
...you'd call me a loner.
Maybe what I need is a family to make me feel nice.
You should have a family.
Well, I got this bad record with my ex.
Well, you don't have to tell people about that.
Yeah, but I just...
You know, I don't want to pull the wool over anybody's eyes.
I don't think you have to worry about it.
Have you always lived down here?
Yes.
Well, have you ever been out of the country?
You know, Texas...
...or Chicago, around?
I went to a Catholic school in San Antonio.
Well, you've been around, then.
That's all I wanna know.
Well, she really did a job on me, Leonard.
Yeah?
I keep acting the way I been acting,
I'm gonna be in deep, you think?
Well, we'll be leaving tomorrow morning.
Yeah. I guess.
You'll just have to hold onto yourself a little longer.
Yeah. That's good.
I'd need a shovel to get at her, Leonard.
I'm not gonna go after her with a shovel.
Well, who said anything about that?
What you gotta do is you gotta move in close.
Look around. See what's cooking, then... out they go.
Boy, kicking dirt about 42 foot in the air, huh?
A couple of loop-the-loops, a little Mexican tailspin.
Pick them up, dust them off, and then just...
Know what I mean?
Well, I don't see how that works as a practical fact.
- But I'm prepared to take your word for it.
- Well, you can take my word.
When you're...
...laying all this stuff on some girl, she must know you're doing it...
...when you're doing it.
- I'm gonna have to say, that all depends.
- On what?
- On what angle you play.
You know what I mean, angle.
Gotcha.
Boy, you're popping in a lot of them candies.
You know, these things are full of dextrose.
It's a big thing with athletes.
I'm running a Holley Carburetor on top here, Jim. A quad.
Doesn't mean a thing to me.
Well, I'm not exactly a man to trust when you've got me playing with a Holley.
I trust you.
You give me a Holley, though, I'm not the best man for the world's fight.
Hey, are we gonna wait here all day, or do you got some cattle to show me, Leonard?
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I just been shooting my mouth off.
Got some Corrientes at 10 o'clock, Jim.
Jesus, they're all skin and bones.
They're delightful looking cattle.
You'd be lucky if they graded
30 percent good.
- The rest is cutters and canners.
- They'd make some nice entertainers.
- It's not me that wants them, anyways.
- For whoever does.
It's the public that wants them, Leonard.
Not just any given individual.
See what you can get out of this thing.
Hang in there, Leonard.
Hang right in there, boy.
Just you try it. Just try it.
Well, here's the spread.
He wants 500 pesos for every one of them jokers in the joker pen.
Well, I just about gagged on that.
How'd you go?
But I can give you my personal voucher he'll drop to 400, easy.
Still, I don't know whether it's worth the fight.
Neither do I.
Let's give him the 500.
And then leave.
Not say another word. Cold shoulder.
You kidding me.
Otherwise we'll leave a bad impression, we come back this way again.
So what?
Well, you just can't buy your way out of a bad impression.
In the first place, you're gonna run out of cash, you go the full 500.
- The hell with it.
- With what?
It.
The hell with it.
I'll just dip into my own pocket.
Well, you can count on me not to tell anybody about this.
- You can tell anyone. I'm paying the freight.
- Well, there's no future in that, Jim.
I don't care.
It's no honeymoon down here.
You gotta fight tooth and nail.
I'll fight. I just...
...don't wanna fight here.
Well...
...he got a real good impression of you, Jim.
That's what you wanted, right?
- No.
- You said that was what.
I just said it would come in handy, is all.
Well, I ain't gonna split hairs.
I better take you way back in where his family is.
I always feel kind of silly getting on these things.
Hang in there, Leonard.
Nobody likes to leave home, Jim.
You know, I know this sounds ironic, but I never said nothing about this morning.
Well, look, you got the cattle in the corral out there. Why don't we go take a look?
Señor Valencia?
Jesus, they're dying on their feet.
I wasn't talking about their personality.
Hey, Leonard.
That's a beauty contest in there.
You betcha.
Of course, you don't see what's happening now, huh?
The old man ain't gonna let you touch them cows in there...
...unless you take the old cows too.
We don't want a lot of soup bones.
Let's get out of here.
You betcha. No. Wait a minute.
- Yeah?
- I'll give you 500 pesos...
...for each one of them Corrientes in that pen.
I don't want nothing to do with the others.
Hey, just tell him we can't take those old cows into the States.
They got a presidential veto on that.
Presidential veto.
- Did he say eight?
- He said eight.
- Have they got a blood bank around here?
- I don't see one, Jim.
I'll give you 500 pesos for them in there.
He's gotta have a little something sweeter than that, Jim.
Oh, let's pay him. This money's burning a hole in my pocket.
- You gonna have to cut down on that, Jim.
- What?
In front of everybody.
- He couldn't understand us.
- He could see you undermining my position.
I see what you mean, and I'm sorry.
Well, there's got to be another way, huh?
They look like a bunch of embalmers.
I didn't say anything.
Well, I can give you...
...five hundred and fifty pesos.
Well, I'm not going back to my figures.
Oh, he's just trying to kick up a fuss.
Well, that's fine. Just fine.
We got other prospects down the line.
You know, I been counting.
We're gonna be short.
Hey, look at mine, how it's open, see?
Well, this ain't enough.
Stretch, I mean, it won't make it.
Well, we've got a supplement for you.
Supplement, a post-dated check.
You can cash it in two weeks.
That's how come it's post-dated.
- There's no amount there.
- You just fill in whatever you want, see?
I mean, we trust you, Express.
Even though you don't trust us.
Because you got a reputation to protect.
Man, you know, it sure is hot here.
I didn't think I could sweat, but I can.
Do you think you'll get them ready by the first?
We're gonna do our best.
Well, that's encouraging.
Tell you why. I want you to meet us in Chihuahua.
Chihuahua? I thought Hermosillo.
Well, Garrett had a change of mind. I mean, business consideration, you know?
He wants them cattle brought into Chihuahua.
Well, that's a tick zone.
If I take them into there, they'll be quarantined forever.
He got it fixed. He "knows a man, knows a man" kind of thing, you know?
But I don't care who he knows.
I mean, if I take them in there...
I'm telling you he's got it fixed.
Garrett ain't like you.
He ain't walking around here in Mexico with a heat rash or something.
Let's forget about Garrett.
I want you to tell me where I can get me one of them gals with them...
...you know, clickers?
The whorehouse.
- What?
- Sure. Zone of tolerance.
Man, you're out of your mind.
I don't pay for it. I go Dutch.
There's a pimp over there at the hotel.
You tell him about that.
What? You're mixed up.
I mean, I'm talking about disease...
...you talking about some pimp friend up at the hotel?
No, he ain't no friend of mine.
Hey, you know a lot of gals around here.
Why don't you take care of it for me?
I work cattle, Stretch.
No, no, no. We rented the pens to keep them in the pens.
We didn't rent the desert, the desert's free.
There's hardly any grass, so the sucker turns them out on the grass.
- Why'd he do that?
- Because he hasn't fed them.
He sold the feed. He says it's not true, but I'm gonna find out.
You don't like my work, señor, you only have to tell me.
Well, if what Leonard said is true, I don't.
What I'm saying is true.
Fine. We're putting the cattle back in the pens.
Tomorrow, all of this will be forgotten.
- I've got a memory like an elephant.
- He doesn't forget things.
And that is good for him?
What he's saying is that you're fired.
Oh, Jim.
I don't think we ought to go that far. His uncle is the ministerio pûblico around here.
I don't care if he's the big chief.
That's what I meant, big chief.
I still don't care. He's gonna get a pink slip says he's fired.
I have wasted my time with you.
Well, we're both in agreement about that, so we ought to feel pretty good.
Leonard.
You gotta run a tighter ship.
If we get our heads together down here, Jim...
...we could make a lot of money.
We could eat it with a knife and a fork.
Well, I ain't gonna check, but they all bulls?
In this country, señor, we do not castrate.
Well, now, if I was buying,
I could give you a better price for steers.
You would be getting inferior cattle.
In my country, they say that...
...castration changes their mind from ass to grass.
Maybe he didn't get that one. You ought to translate it.
- Why don't we just let it ride.
- Say it was a quote.
- Let it ride.
- Say it wasn't my idea.
I've decided to let you have 19
Corrientes at 500 pesos a head.
Give you 400.
Your friend told me 500.
- No, I said...
- No. He said it was up to 500.
That's a distinction.
For that spotted one, though, I'd go...
...five hundred for that.
- Eight hundred and fifty.
- I couldn't take any less.
- No, 600.
I couldn't hardly pop for any more.
We cannot trade.
Lay back with old Leonard.
He'll come down.
I got a grudge against the mother.
Well, lookie there.
He's not happy, not today.
But he's coming our way.
He may try to get us to go higher...
...but I got an attitude about that.
Home free.
Yeah.
A lot of people have had to walk that same path, Jim.
Those long hundred steps.
I have been waiting here for you, señor.
You must have been waiting six days because that's how long we've been gone.
Yes. Yes, I have been waiting.
I have been waiting for you.
You're not gonna get that one past me.
Because you haven't been sitting there for six days.
Now, you quit hitting at me, friend.
I'm not a boxer and I'm not a roundhouser.
You forgot to pay us some wages.
Well, two things:
First, I hired you, not them.
And second, I already paid you once.
You been sucking on that mescal bottle so much you can't keep things straight.
You forgot to pay me some wages.
I don't work for nothing!
And you talk to me about wages.
Jesus Christ.
No, it's okay, boys. I got it.
Everything's gonna be A-okay.
Nobody's hurt, just a little fun.
Here's your old sombrero, pal.
Now remember, I had nothing to do with it.
Just an accident.
So leave my tires alone, huh?
Hey!
Hi, Jim.
I got something to say.
Oh, yeah? What's the matter?
There's some secret police downstairs.
They come around when you're in trouble.
So, what do you mean?
It means they wanna put you away for a while.
What do they want with me?
They're gonna take you into town.
That won't do any good, running that way.
They'll just impound your pickup.
Pickup?
Listen, I got a plan.
Seeing as how you gotta go along anyway...
...why don't you let me turn you in?
It would look good for me, help me around here.
I don't know about that.
- Well, the end result's gonna be the same.
- Still!
I'm not gonna run out on you, Jim.
I'm talking about the end look of the thing.
Now, here's how it works.
We're gonna go through that door, right there.
Gotta see some people, if you know what I mean.
- Who?
- I ain't gonna say in front of everybody.
Guerro Chavarin, a nephew of mine...
...has charged you with injuries to his person.
Well, I mean, he come at me swinging.
He should've been there.
Well, he has made a complaint against you.
But he's willing to drop the charges if you will pay the damages.
I wouldn't pay him 20 cents Mexican.
You won't pay?
He could've had a pistol somewhere.
But my advice to you would be to pay.
I don't even have to think about what
I'm gonna say next, which is no.
It's a matter... It's a matter of principle.
It is a matter of 6000 pesos.
Well, that's a lot of pesos.
You must go with him.
Well, I'd rather stay here in town.
You will not have to leave town.
Well, then, l... I mean, I'm just going back to my hotel by myself, huh?
We can discuss that some other time.
Say, friend, you couldn't spare a cigarette, could you?
I ain't got one.
I'm trying to quit.
You kill anybody?
No, of course not.
- Just exactly what I mean.
- What did you say?
I mean, I didn't either, but here I sit.
Oh, yeah? Why?
For one, I didn't have a passport.
And two, wouldn't nobody listen to me.
You gotta have a passport, you wanna score around here.
Well, I don't have a passport, but then, I don't wanna score.
Of course, I don't mean "score" in a big-time sense of the word.
I just mean, take in the sights when you want.
Not stay locked up.
Well, I thought that's what you meant.
Tell them you don't need a damn passport. They won't listen.
Well, they got their own ideas, I guess.
How's that?
All they gotta do is phone
Marshall Field's in Chicago.
They got all my damn references.
They'll vouch for me.
I got a friend, name of Leonard.
I kind of count on him to find an angle.
You think maybe he can find one for me?
Many as he's got.
Three thousand pesos.
Look, I only wanna sell the thing.
I can't do much better than that.
You gringos can get in trouble for selling a car here.
Not that much trouble.
Still, I can get in a lot for buying one.
You don't think we ought to share the risk?
No. No, no.
Well, that's how it goes, friend.
People share risks.
Well, not around me.
You know, I really don't understand your attitude.
Now! Now, now.
Where did you get the money?
I sold your pickup.
That hoodlum's out there somewhere.
Figuring up things, getting new angles on things.
Yeah.
You think?
He's probably on his hands and knees someplace, drunk.
Where?
Some dark place. Full of pulque.
Yeah.
Jim, you gotta understand the character of these people.
They live a rough-and-tumble life.
They don't have a word for "rough-and-tumble." Did you know that?
- I'd like to run him over with a car.
- Hey, now you think twice about that.
Because you'd be the first one they'd suspect.
First on the list of suspects.
Hey.
Hey, boy!
Here. Right here.
Now, every time he sees a rock lying in the street...
...he's gonna be thinking about you.
- You betcha.
- Do you have an account here?
- No.
The thing is, a fellow by the name of Russell does.
Fine. Let me take your papers.
- I'll be a moment.
- Right.
I'm sorry, señor, but this account has been withdrawn.
Wait, are we talking about the same guy?
I mean, a high roller, name of Russell?
Anything else I can do for you?
You have this happen much?
I don't think so.
- You straightened out there, Jim?
- I'm fine.
You look fine.
Well, what do you mean?
Just let's get the cattle down to Chihuahua and find those bastards.
Now, what are you gonna do about the weight on these things?
They're for rodeo.
I don't care about weight.
The reason I asked is they're losing weight fast.
- Maybe we could put some fill on them.
- How's that?
Starve them the last couple of days before we get to Chihuahua.
Then fill them up with hay and water.
You think that would be right?
You mean, could I square it with the man upstairs?
That's not what I mean, Leonard.
- Listen, once there was this old man.
- Yeah?
Well, that's not the end of the story.
There's this old man and he had an old plow, and an old mule...
...and an old dried-up prune of a wife and a little shack.
Well, one day that mule just up and died on him.
And you know what he said, Leonard?
He said, "Them that has must lose."
Joker, huh?
No, he was serious.
"Them that has must lose."
Who did he think he was fooling?
He was just expressing a point of view, Leonard.
Well, he was a joker, then.
Well, he was there in the scene, Leonard.
He'd know what to say.
You can lead a "Ha-ha" to water but you can't make them:
You know, they say that every man has a star.
Now, a guy should find his star out there...
...unless he doesn't have one.
Which is maybe the case with me.
If what they're saying is right...
...why, guys could just follow their stars.
But not me, because I don't have one.
I didn't know what I was saying, was that interesting.
I heard a noise.
The cattle are shuffling out there.
No. There's this one guy calling another guy a shitheel.
Really?
Maybe we better go check.
Sure, him thinking that we wouldn't worry about just a few head.
You let that happen every day, it adds up, though.
I got a heater.
Oh, let one of the hands go take a look.
What's the matter with you?
Well, Garrett's gonna cheat me anyway.
Trouble is, they're his cattle, not mine.
Guess somebody forgot to think about that.
Give me that thing.
It's been fired.
The smell goes away after a few hours.
What was it?
Well, he was shooting at somebody.
A rustler.
I don't know why, but those two spotted ones always seem to stick together.
Buddies.
They got buddies too, Leonard.
Reminds me of two hookers I knew in Flagstaff, or was it in Kansas City?
Here comes Big Red.
- Boy, that's a real high diver there.
- Yeah, he didn't seem too bad.
Look at the submarine he's got.
Okay.
You know...
...if I was to stay in this branch of work...
...first I'd get me some hogs.
Because they only muss one corner of the pen. Did you know that?
Hogs.
Now, you guys have done some terrific work.
And maybe I can't give you a letter of reference...
...but you got my respect.
And if we ever get down this way again, with any luck...
...we're gonna look specifically for you, you, you and you.
Or if we got some friends coming down here...
...we're gonna put them onto you.
But either way, no matter how you cut the slice...
...somebody is gonna be thinking of you.
If we don't have enough money...
...to pay the railroad or the trucks when we get there.
Garrett will be waiting for us.
But you were saying how slippery he was.
Well, it's just in his best interest.
Here.
Tacos. Tacos, tamales.
Tacos, tamales, tacos.
No, I don't think so.
Look, come on, F.O. Pal.
Hey, did you ever think about colored salt?
- What?
- Salt. Colored salt.
So you know when you've shaken too much on your food, you know?
I don't think most people can tell when it's white.
I never thought about that.
Well, there's lots of salt down there.
And the dye you could get from the States.
Something to bear in mind.
Hey.
You know how they call me the Chihuahua Express?
Well, I never heard that.
Well, it's not true. I'm not.
Well, I wouldn't worry about anybody standing in line for the title.
The only reason I bring it up is just...
...one reason why I wish we were going to Hermosillo instead of Chihuahua.
We'll go to Hermosillo later.
Gotcha.
- Are you the ones?
- What do you want?
I have the trucks ready.
Well, where's that Russell?
- Who?
- Stretch Russell.
Who is he?
He owns the cattle.
Or a guy by the name of Garrett.
- What's the difference?
- I don't know.
You asked for the trucks.
I have brought them.
You want to come with me or you pay me here?
Look, he'll be along. In the meantime, why don't we load the cattle...
...then we'll take care of these railroad jokers.
This is a tick area.
- We have a problem with ticks.
- That's simple.
- Where are the cattle now?
- Down in the stockyards where they belong.
Well, we will have to put them into quarantine. For 60 days.
- Quarantine?
- You didn't know?
Me? Hell, I wrote the book.
This confederate of mine, this Garrett...
...he was suppose to put the fix in with you guys.
Don't let them boys talk you into anything.
Yeah, but I'll bet plenty have tried, huh?
Most who try are big shots.
Well, I'm a cattle broker.
You smell like one.
That's silver dollars you smell, honey.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
You know, I come down here for tax purposes.
Maybe you had your own reasons.
I'll tell you, honey. I ain't gonna bury that silver in some safe place...
...or a lucky spot, you know?
Señor...
...I don't need your money.
But you need devotion.
- I should've said that in the first place.
- Stupid donkey.
Hey, mister, shine your shoes for one peso.
Come on, mister, only 50 centavos.
Just like I said, tick zone.
Where are your buddies?
Oh, they'll be by pretty soon.
Well, watch out if they don't.
You think they're gonna pull a fast one?
I never met them and shook their hands, so I can't say.
Look, I only met them once, Leonard.
Well, we're gonna have to stake them out.
Take a hike.
Hey, I know you.
Well, lookie here. It's the Express.
- Yeah. How are you, Stretch?
- I'm all right.
Well, I'm feeling real fine because today is payday for me.
You happy, huh?
Well, something gonna put a damper on your payday.
You know the steers you brought?
Every one of them is in quarantine.
Well, that's exactly where I said they'd be.
I said it twice and then I stopped.
They're gonna be in there for 60 days.
And you know what happens?
The bottom drops out of the rodeo market.
It just goes deader than a doornail.
Well, hey.
I don't know about that. But then, see,
I'm not a big rodeo promoter like you.
Listen, Garrett has had to put up another $ 1000 just to feed them.
Now, not even can he sell them suckers, but he can't pay to feed them.
I don't know what to tell you, Stretch.
We're not trying to get out of anything.
I mean, I said we gonna pay you $2 a head, we gonna pay you.
What you got there?
- Five hundred dollars is what I got here.
- Let me study it.
All right. That's all right by me.
I mean, you wouldn't try to sneak nothing by me...
...because you got a reputation to protect, right?
How you want that, cash or check?
I want cash, now.
You know, your...
Your last check didn't work.
All right. There it is. Five $ 100 bills.
You know, I gotta meet up with somebody.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Now, then the next thing that we gotta get to:
Five hundred and sixty dollars expenses.
- Now you...
- That's not very much.
- Look here...
- I wrote it all down if you wanna look.
- Now, look...
- I haven't even paid the railroad.
I'll tell you what, you keep writing in that book, Express...
...because we've got a 60-day quarantine to face and we gonna face it together.
- I'm sorry about that.
- Well, you can just be sorry about it.
We are in financial trouble and you come to me with expenses.
No, that was part of the deal.
I had to pay them, see?
That's what makes them expenses.
Well, I can tell you one thing:
Garrett ain't gonna like it one bit.
I don't work for nothing.
Now, I wanna get some action on this.
Be quiet. Come on with me.
What's the matter?
Listen, I'm a middleman.
Don't you understand about middlemen?
The steers you brought wasn't too bright.
Some of it must have rubbed off.
Well, I don't know about that.
I gotta figure out about this.
Express, there ain't nothing to figure.
So get your mind right about one thing:
I just work for the man.
If he won't pay, I can't make him.
- Well, the best thing is... Where is he?
- I don't know.
Told me he had a sister once, lived up in Denver.
Well, she's probably married and changed her name.
Could be. But I'll tell you one thing:
I don't have time to stand around here and talk about it, see?
Would you please do something about this money?
Boy, you better get ahold of yourself.
Hey.
Are there any calls or messages from that guy Stretch Russell?
- What?
- It always seemed to me that I should be...
...in some branch of detective work.
Hey, you on to something?
Well, I operate on the principle:
If you've found one, you've found the other.
So here's how I worked it.
I was just sitting on the curb back there and Stretch walked past me. Right past me.
So I followed him.
There's a funny smell in here.
Mexican Western Union.
Come on in.
Say, is there a laundry service around here anywhere?
- I didn't invite you into my room.
- We came in without an invitation.
Well, get the hell out of here!
Both of you!
- You taking a bath?
- No, I'm not taking a bath.
I happen to have a lady in the other room.
- Now, what do you want?
- Garrett's what we want.
Well, I don't know nothing about him.
I'm only up here with a lady.
- We've come for him. Where is he?
- You asking the wrong man.
I didn't see a lady, but look what I found.
Yeah, well, there's $50 maximum in there.
You shot the moon on your accommodations here, didn't you?
I bet you even got a sunken bathtub back there.
It's an expense account item, that's why.
You think you can tell us where he is, because I'm pretty angry.
- Well, I don't keep tabs on him!
- Don't make me use any of my stuff on you.
He's right downstairs in the barbershop.
I don't wanna worry about him when
I gotta worry about what he's talking about.
I'll stay here, Jim, just in case.
Excuse me.
Hey.
You haven't got a real knack with people, cowboy.
Well, neither have you.
I don't like you busting into my private situation.
I busted in to talk some business.
What business? I'm done with you.
If you got any more to talk about, you take it up with Stretch.
You're the one that's gonna pay.
Now, you better know that.
The only way you can make me really mad is create a scene.
You wanna talk, you make an appointment.
You don't raise hell in here.
Hey, you didn't pay the barber either.
Hey, don't mess them shirts. I can't find the laundry around here, you know.
Gotcha.
We sure had you figured wrong.
I told Stretch you had a head on your shoulders.
What did Stretch say?
You ask me that now, I don't remember.
Now, you both together owe me $560.
- Less the 40 I just took.
- I don't owe you a dime.
Stretch made a deal, went over his head.
- Way.
- Well, that's your problem.
Look, son, everybody has a bad experience once in a while.
But you really gone off the deep end.
Look, I gotta make a living just like everybody else.
You coming into my room.
You leave me alone in my own room.
Listen, I want my money up front, right now.
You can't wait for anything.
You gotta have it right now.
You owe me money.
I wouldn't be here if you didn't.
And I wouldn't be angry either.
You ought to straighten him out.
Well, he don't wanna listen, Bill.
He thinks he's doing fine.
I never said that.
See what I mean?
Doesn't leave any room for criticism.
I been busting my ass for four weeks.
I gotta show some payment on my books.
Look, I don't know anything about that.
But read the papers. The bottom has fallen out of the rodeo market.
Everybody's gonna take a dive.
Me worst of all.
Stretch, if I could think of a single reason why I should pay him...
- I mean, he don't wanna think. He's crazy.
- I tried...
- Just give me one good reason why...
- He doesn't know what he's talking about.
No particular reason.
You're not impressing me at all, cowboy.
That's hotel furniture and I'm sitting here waiting for the house dicks to come.
But you're the one that's gonna have to pay.
Who the hell is he?
Listen, there's money around here.
I smell cash.
Let's just have a look at that money belt.
What are you doing?
Don't do it!
Wait. Wait. Wait.
This is gonna hurt in a few minutes.
Son of a bitch.
Get me a cold cloth, Stretch.
I'll take a little breather here.
This is gonna be $ 1000 worth of bridge work.
Maybe $2000.
Thank you, Stretch.
Look, I didn't pull any rough stuff on you.
You know, we can stay around here all night, if you would like.
No. I got some things I gotta check.
Well, I can stay here by myself, Jim.
Hey, we don't wait around for anybody, Leonard.
You're gonna pay up sometime.
And in the meanwhile...
...you ain't got no dignity.
First and second on the list of suspects.
What did you do that for?
Is there something wrong with my mouth?
Well, them horses of yours did have the dourine.
Well, we better keep our mouths shut about that.
Yeah.
Did you see me dump that television out the window?
Hey, man, I was there.
- I just run it right out the window.
- You don't have to tell me.
Want a beer?
The police will have their eye open.
We don't have anything to worry about now.
They can always find us if they want us.
The place is crawling with spies.
What you thinking?
Nothing.
You wanna know what I'm thinking?
Yeah, okay.
I'm thinking...
...about a big can of yellow peaches.
He could have sold his car, Leonard.
I'm talking now in a more serious vein.
No, he wouldn't pay.
No, he wanted to pay, he just said he couldn't.
You know, I could've cut a dollar sign on his belly.
Hey, Bill. Bill. Excuse me, Bill...
...but I got a problem.
I look down, and I seem to find a Mexican boxing glove in my hand, huh?
From now on, they're gonna call you
Dollar Bill Garrett.
You're just gonna have to live with it.
You might be able to get it off with plastic surgery, but that's up to you.
Do you think that would have scared him?
Scared the hell out of him?
Oh, I don't know.
I don't think he would get much nookie cut up like that.
Then again, he might get a lot.
Girls would just sit there, think he was something else.
But you think it would have scared him?
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know.
Well, the only way we'll ever know for sure, is to call him up and ask him.
- He won't say.
- I don't know.
Leonard, you come down here, you bust your hump and what do you got?
You got me, Jim.
[ENGLISH]
You are seven years old.
You are a man.
Bury your first toy and your mother's picture.
The mole digs tunnels under the earth, looking for the sun.
Sometimes, he gets to the surface.
When he sees the sun, he is blinded.
Kill me! Kill me, please!
Who did this?
Kill me, please!
Who?
Who?
- It was the Colonel.
- How many were there?
Another five men.
Where?
At the Franciscan Mission.
The Colonel is not selfish.
He uses women once, and then gives them to us.
The Colonel said he'd kill whoever touched me.
Who asked for them?
Do not anticipate my wishes.
Forgive us!
They have no soul.
But sometimes they get bored, so I hand them the leftovers.
Ask, dogs. Ask!
Stay put, dogs.
Kiss them on the mouth.
Go on, kiss the other one.
Stay put, dogs!
These animals like to watch.
They want to look at your breasts.
Eat, dogs!
Who are you to judge me?
I am God!
No, not that! Anything, but that!
Lay him down on the ground.
Destroy me. Depend on no one.
Cry, boy, cry!
Cry so he'll have mercy.
It's bitter.
Moses found water in the desert.
But people couldn't drink it, for it was bitter.
They called the water "Mara".
It's become sweet.
I'll call you Mara, for you are like bitter water.
How are we to live here?
We'll die of thirst.
As a hind longs for the running streams, so do I long for thee, oh God.
With my soul,
I thirst for God, the living God.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
- Do you love me?
- Yes.
I don't. So that I may love you, you have to be the best.
Four great gun masters live in this desert.
You've got to look for them, and kill them.
The desert is a circle.
To find them, we'd have to travel in a spiral.
I can't go on! Let's go back!
Whenever I start something,
I finish it.
We'll never find them.
If they are real masters, they will give us a signal.
We have been walking for days, months, years.
How can you have such faith?
They await us.
The signal!
You seek the light in the middle of the day.
I know what you came for.
You'll have to wait to see him.
Just like that woman.
The master doesn't want to fight her.
The great master wants to see you right now.
It's strange.
He's always kept them waiting.
After the dune, there's an oasis.
Your woman must wait there.
Let's go!
Give me your gun and hat.
I need no light. I am blind.
Count to three and try to grab it.
One, two, three...
How?
I try not to win, but to achieve the perfect domain.
So as not to fear the bullets.
Shoot!
I bleed little now.
I offer no resistance to the bullets.
I let them pass through the empty spots of my flesh.
Do you still want to fight me?
Yes.
I don't fear killing you because there is no death.
I'll let you fire first.
- He's greater than I am.
- You'll win.
Even though I'd win, I'd lose.
I want a winner. Find out how.
Don't fight honestly.
Make up something. Cheat him.
There's always a way to win.
Find a way.
I told you so. I said you could win.
I am proud of you.
You have three more masters left.
I know where the second one lives.
If you let me come,
I could take you there.
It's here.
Wait.
We were waiting for you.
This is what the cards foretell.
You are falling. You keep falling.
The deeper you fall, the higher you'll get.
Coward, murderer!
The Lord's will is unexplainable.
My son and I must respect you.
You may fight him.
Come closer.
The duel begins this moment.
You may shoot when you desire.
Dead.
Technically, you're dead.
I now wish to speak to the dead one.
Follow me.
I began making copper objects.
And thus strengthened my fingers.
I now make delicate things.
I am so strong now that I can play with this object, without breaking it.
Shoot!
A very delicate shot.
It destroys the precise.
You shoot to find yourself,
I do it in order to vanish.
Perfection is to get lost.
In order to get lost, you have to love.
You don't love. You destroy, you kill, and no one loves you.
For when you think you are giving, you are really taking away.
I have given myself to her.
I gave her all.
She's within me.
Her immense love fills me.
What I do and say, is dictated and sanctified by her.
I hate anything that is mine, for it turns me away from her divine presence.
Two are better than one.
For if one fell, the second would help him.
But pity the lonely one, with no one to help him.
When I did it,
I didn't think it would be any good.
I only tried to do it the best I could.
Take your gun again.
My son wishes to give you one last chance.
PROPHETS
Don't get near him.
Why do you follow us? Get lost!
There was no need to draw your gun.
I do not distrust you.
You have a flute.
We'll know each other by music.
You loath yourself.
You don't wish to play tricks anymore.
You now want to respect the law.
Some give flowers, others give valuable things.
You bring me your own life.
You don't fear death anymore.
That's why you are a dangerous foe.
When you were seven yards from the corral, my rabbits began to die.
Almost all of them are dead.
Now that you are here, not one of them will live.
I made it myself!
See its fineness!
I'll take just one shot.
That's all I need.
One bullet, always deadly.
Shoot.
Can you tell which one you shot?
This one is yours.
It's been hit in the head.
This one is mine.
It's been hit in the heart.
The heart, and the head.
Swap them.
It's time.
Too much perfection is a mistake.
You won!
Don't leave me! You will be the best.
I'll help you. There's only one left.
You want to fight me?
How will you do it?
I haven't got a gun anymore.
I traded the gun for a butterfly net.
You'll have to fight with your fists.
Strike! Strike! Strike!
You see, my net is mightier than your bullets.
If you shoot again, it will go back into your heart.
How could you win?
For I don't fight, I have nothing.
Even though you cheated, you couldn't have taken anything.
Yes, I could have taken your life.
Life! I don't care about that.
I'll show you.
You lost.
You won! You are the best.
I have been spilt like water, and my bones have been dislocated.
My heart has turned to wax and melts within me.
And my tongue sticks to my jaw.
I am laid low in the dust of death.
My God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Why are You so far from saving me, from heeding my groans?
Oh, my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou dost not answer.
In the night I cry, but I get no respite.
It's either him or me?
Make thy paths known from me.
Oh, Lord, teach me thy ways.
Lead me in thy truth and teach me.
Thou art God, my savior.
I have waited all day long for thee.
You'll show the sinners the way.
You'll lead us through final judgment.
PSALMS
I am not a God.
I am a man.
How long have I been here?
When you got here,
I hadn't yet been born.
I've looked after you since I was a child.
The old woman says that you'll free us. Come!
We've been prisoners here for many years.
That hole is the only way out.
You have to climb for a few days to get to it.
Outside, down the mountain, there's a town.
They won't help us to get out.
We are deformed, due to the continuous incest.
We are repulsive to them.
It must be hard to bring me here.
Why did you do it?
The old lady knows.
She sent for you.
She wants to see you now.
This is not me! This is not my face.
I'll get money and I'll dig a tunnel.
The tunnel will join the town with this cave.
When I finish it, you'll be free at last.
You'll get out of here!
So, that's the great town!
We'll have to beg.
Fix the curls.
Fix my nails!
Cream!
A fan!
This degenerate is looking at my legs!
Help, he's embracing me!
You are witnesses!
He's kissed me by force!
Filthy slave! How dare you!
Help, he's raping me!
Stop him! Murderer!
Stop him! Don't let him get away!
Rapist! He's a degenerate!
Murderer, murderer!
Do you think it's worth it for my people to come here?
This is worse.
I'll keep on digging.
How many meters have we dug?
I dig!
We've lost our audience!
Hey, you monsters! Come here!
We'll pay you a good fee.
Both are dead.
- Who died first?
- This one.
This one is the champion.
You protect us, oh Lord!
You protect us, oh Lord!
God loves us and protects us!
If we have faith, nothing will happen to us.
We must play with our Lord.
Death is our bet.
And let the one who doesn't have faith, die.
A miracle!
A miracle!
A miracle!
Fear not, it's a blank.
The weapon. It's a miracle!
A miracle!
APOCALYPSE
No one will come anymore.
The circus is over.
I'll go also.
Come in, come in!
As always, the Decent Women League, after it's monthly inspection, greets their husbands.
Everything in here is decent.
Do you want to make some money?
Come, come!
Go down!
Come in!
Do your kissing stunt.
We now want to see the rest.
Undress! The wedding night!
I love you. They do not exist.
There's nobody, but you.
We're alone. Take me, please.
We'll be able to buy dynamite to keep digging the tunnel.
Hey, why are you hiding?
I am ashamed.
You must be disgusted by me.
You are going to leave me.
No, come with me.
Tell him to marry us.
Go!
We are going to get married, Father.
You can't kill him.
He's doing great things.
He promised he'd dig the tunnel, so they would be free.
I'll wait until you finish the job.
Then I will kill you.
But I'll be watching you, so you don't escape.
We'll never finish it.
It takes too much time.
If you want us to go faster, help us to dig.
And if you want to finish sooner, help us to beg.
It's hard rock.
We've tried it a thousand times and we can't do it.
Just a thousand times?
Your pain must be unbearable.
This body feels the pain, not me.
You'll never do it. Stop it!
We've made it! We've made it!
Do not tell them yet.
They are still unprepared.
I cannot kill my master.

With the Indians!
Avram !
I want to talk to you in private.
Speak only English.
And no matter what I say, don't smile.
Out of 88 students graduating from this yeshiva... you came in a close 87.
Don't smile.
Look sad.
There is a new congregation...
In America?
Wait!
Some meshuggener suggested your name to become the new rabbi.
I am forced to take an official vote of the board of rabbis.
Close.
It's a close vote.
But I am the Chief Rabbi!
I am the one who has to decide!
So, cowboy...
I am sending you to San Francisco.
- Where is San Francisco?
- By New York.
Get out, quick.
And so, on a wonderful sunny day in 1850...
I started out my great adventure...
and I left Poland for Philadelphia...
the city where all the brothers love each other...
The boat's gone.
Understand?
Somebody should have told us!
This is the devil's work.
- What'd he say?
- Says the boat is gone.
Mister, what'd you just say about the boat to San Francisco?
- Gone!
- Well, that can't be.
That boat's supposed to leave first tide in the morning!
Supposed to?
What the hell's the matter with you?
It's a gold rush.
Haven't you people heard anything?
- Next boat two months.
- Oh, God!
Oh, my God, help me!
Just this morning me and my brother got the news.
All right. Who's next?
Our mama's dying in San Francisco.
What am I gonna do?
There must be some way that a person can go to San Francisco... in another way than the boat.
Not for us, sir.
Just 10 minutes ago, me and my brother sold our horses and our wagon... so as we could purchase tickets on this here boat.
And now we ain't got neither.
Well, perhaps if you go to the man... and you told him your troubles and you give him back the money... he would give you back the wagon.
You think he'll do it?
If he is a good man, I think he would do that, yes.
Mister, would you help me, please?
I'm not much good at explaining myself and...
I usually just start to cry.
I will do that.
I would be happy to do it.
But I don't know if I would be much help to you.
With the way I speak English...
Wait, you don't have to carry the bags.
My brother, his name is Matt.
- Oh, say, what's your name?
- Avram.
Avram. My name's Darryl, Darryl Diggs.
Anyway, my brother's got a temper.
Sometimes he just unloads, you know what I mean?
- Can't I help you to carry...
- No, that's all right.
I've got it all. Don't worry about a thing.
Just step in here, anyway. Come on, what is it again, Avrum?
Avram. But you didn't do nothing wrong.
- Everything go all right?
- Well, we missed the boat.
- What?
- The boat sailed yesterday.
The whole town's gone crazy, Matt.
It's gold rush. It sailed yesterday.
Yeah, but what are we supposed to do now?
Well, God may be on our side yet,
Matt, thanks to this here gentleman.
Avram, this is my brother, Matthew Diggs.
- How do you do?
- Mr. Jones!
Mr. Jones, we missed our boat and we find ourselves in a desperate state.
We need our horses and our wagon back... so as we can get to San Francisco to see our mum before she dies.
So if you'd be kind enough to take your money back...
I sympathize with your misfortunes, fellows. But you've got to understand...
I'm in the business of buying and selling... and I don't sell unless
I can make a profit.
But we don't have no money to give you a profit.
Then we don't do no business.
Excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Jones.
How much profit do you need from these gentlemen?
$50. That's it, Matt, we're sunk.
I'm sorry, Avram. Sorry
I wasted your time.
Well, perhaps I could pay the $50.
It's real kind of you, Avram.
I don't know how's we could ever pay you back. Do you, Matt?
$50, look, I don't know.
If I could have a seat on your wagon to San Francisco...
I would be more than paid back.
Well, you pay the $50... you could have a seat with a cushion on it. Can't he, Matt?
All the way.
I would share the cushion.
Matt, the Lord is smiling on you and me today!
Amen.
Gentlemen, quiet!
Wonderful, marvelous news.
Just this morning, I received this letter.
"Dear Mr. Bender:
"This is to inform you that soon, God willing...
"you will have a rabbi and a Torah.
"Rabbi Avram Belinski has left Poland...
"to join you in the village of San Francisco.
"Avram thanks you for the picture of your lovely family.
"He is looking eagerly forward to meeting your daughter Sarah Mindl...
"with an eye towards matrimony."
- Papa !
- Not now, Sarah Mindl.
But, Julius!
Go to your room.
What's the matter with Sarah Mindl?
Bender, a rabbi is better than a Rosensheine.
You want a bite?
Oh, thanks.
There she is, Avram.
That little shortcut I was telling you about.
Gonna get us to San
Francisco four days earlier.
Good.
Whoa !
What happened? Is it Indians?
Mr. Jones, what's happening?
I don't understand. What's...
Darryl, tell him I paid the $50!
He paid the $50.
- You paid the $50?
- Yeah, I did.
Is it clothes what you want?
You want to take my clothes?
You need my clothes so much?
You don't have your own clothes?
No! No! Not the Torah, please!
Take my money, you can have the...
God! God, help me!
Mr. Jones, please don't do that!
Please! Please! No!
What's you need my tallis for?
Why are you doing this?
- We love you.
- Mr. Jones... why are you doing this?
- You're not happy with our service?
- No.
God! I don't want to be with these filthy crooks!
- We'll fix that for you, bucko.
- No!
There you go!
- How'd we do?
- I got the rest of his money.
This you couldn't throw out first!
America.
Landsmen! Landsmen!
Hello!
Landsmen!
Landsmen!
Hello!
Landsmen!
Dost thou speak English?
Dost thou...
speak...
You know, I think he's crazy.
We have decided... that thou shouldst have this money for the train to Akron.
We are sorry it cannot be more.
We all hope it will help thee on thy journey...
Brother Avram.
I will never forget thy kindness.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye, children.
Good-bye. Thank you very much.
Thanks.
- Good-bye. -
Good-bye, Avram.
My parents have a farm... not big like this one, but they have a nice farm.
How is it that thou are not a farmer?
Well, God made me a rabbi.
- Why?
- Why?
I think he had enough farmers.
What a wonderful country.
Simple Simon says, "Put your fingers on your nose."
Simple Simon says, "No laughing."
Simple Simon says, "Put your fingers on your nose."
I really have to go!
Simple Simon says, "Put your fingers on your nose."
Don't bother the man, honey.
Simple Simon says, "You don't have to play."
I think we're an hour and a half away.
- Mommy, I'm getting sleepy.
- Then take a nap.
- Can you stop it?
- Mama, I'm hungry.
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?
Now I want you all to stay calm and listen...
'cause I'm only gonna say this once.
First thing is: don't turn around.
There's a man behind you with a big shotgun... and he don't care to be recognized.
Them that don't believe me is gonna die.
All right now. You all put your hands on top of your heads.
Good. That's real good.
Now we're all gonna play like we're in church.
You got something for the collection, sir?
Very kind.
Ma'am? Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Ma'am?
Thank you.
Well, thank you all very much.
Mr. Jake, I'm jumping here, you go at the next bend.
Remember, folks... the best way to keep your heads is keep your hands on top of them.
And don't turn around.
Better to give than to receive, ain't it, folks?
Simple Simon says, "Everybody laugh."
Don't you get the joke?
Simple says, "Everybody gotta laugh."
It's difficult to explain that a Jew can't ride on a Saturday.
And, for a Jew, Saturday begins on Friday.
- Name?
- Joseph Pellerton.
See the foreman. Name?
Good? Good.
See the foreman. Name?
You funny looking fellow.
- Yes. Yes.
- See the foreman. Name?
Yes.
See the foreman.
- You ever work on railroad before?
- No. This is the first time for me.
K-O-V...
See the foreman.
- You sure talk funny.
- Name?
- Yes.
- See the foreman.
- Yes.
- Name?
John Browning.
Strange-looking characters looking for jobs.
See the foreman.
- Name?
- Belinski.
Sorry, Paco. Sorry. It wouldn't happen again.
You can bet your boots on that.
He did it again.
Wait, Paco. Wait!
Wait, it wasn't done on purpose.
- Avram, some water over here.
- Coming right up.
Got nice, fresh water coming right up.
- Avram.
- What? What happened?
Paco? No!
- It was an accident. I didn't mean to...
- I kill you, pendejo!
I'll bust your Jewish bones!
You smart, you listen.
We open a big restaurant.
You work one year, make enough money to buy a wagon.
Maybe we even go with you, huh?
Open a big joint in San Francisco!
Paco, would you show me where to buy a horse?
Hey, pendejo. How you going to find your way?
Paco, please, just show me where to buy a horse.
You're crazy, Jew-boy!
You gonna get lost!
Believe me, I won't get lost!
Oh, yes, you will.
Good-bye!
Good-bye, Paco.
Good-bye, Mr. Ping!
Wait! Wait, horsie!
Wait, wait, horsie! Take it easy.
Nice horsie. That's a good horsie.
That's it.
Let's take it slow and easy.
Slow! Slow.
That's it. You're a good horsie.
Sarah Mindl. Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.
Oh, my Sarah, Sarah.
Oh, show me what you meant to me.
Oh, my food! My food!
Why me?
My food, you're gonna take?
You got the whole world, you're gonna take my food!
Not you! Wait!
Not you! Wait! Horsie, wait!
No food and no horse.
Come back!
Come here, horsie!
I'll be good to you! I'll be nice!
I'll pick grass for you!
I'll scratch your back!
I'll give you a nice rub!
Chicken, chicken.
Chickie, chickie, chicken.
Come here. I don't wanna hurt you.
I just want to eat you.
Come here, wait! I don't wanna hurt you!
I just want to make you kosher!
How hungry are you?
I'm pretty hungry.
If you had been here yesterday... we could've had roast chicken!
So that's Jewish cooking, huh?
Pretty good, huh?
Where're you coming from?
Back there.
You're from California, huh?
California is that way?
You're lost, ain't you?
- Got any money?
- No.
Got any food?
No.
Sure talk funny.
- Where you born at?
- Poland.
Is that near Pittsburgh?
No. That's near Czechoslovakia.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
And you're going to California?
Yes.
You ain't gonna make it.
Excuse me... in the morning, would you be kind enough... to point out in which direction is San Francisco?
- Sure.
- Good.
- In the morning.
- In that case... would you like to fight for that last fish?
You think you got a chance?
I think I can say, with complete confidence, none whatsoever... but I'm still hungry.
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.
What you call this kind of fish?
- That's a trout.
- A trout?
It's got a lot of bones.
You got family waiting for you?
I'm promised a wife when
I get to San Francisco.
But I haven't never met her.
You gonna marry a woman that you never seen?
I didn't say I never seen her.
I said I never met her.
They sent me a picture before I left Poland.
Well.
What you think?
Well, that's my kind of woman.
You son of a gun.
You son of a gun, you.
Shee-it!
I guess so.
This other one ain't bad, neither.
- Good night, Rabbi.
- Good night, cowboy.
Well, it's nice meeting up with you, pard.
Nice meeting up with you, pard.
- You got it straight?
- Oh, sure.
Right from this tree...
I head straight north five or six weeks... till I come to the flat country.
- Yeah.
- Then I make a left for two days.
That way I avoid the Indians.
Then I cross the river... and I make a sharp right, away from the mountains.
Once I get to the desert, God willing...
I just continue straight as piss... till I come to the ocean. Take a left... keeping the ocean on my right shoulder... and just hot-tail it right into San Francisco.
Good?
Pretty good.
Well...
I hope you make it.
Okay, wait, horse. Good.
All right, go, horsie.
That's it, straight ahead.
- Speak any Mexican, do you?
- No. Why do you ask?
Oh, nothing. Just curious.
If you should ever come to San Francisco,
I hope that you'll call on me... and we could talk over some nice times.
- Come on, horsie.
- Hey... that way.
That way?
Of course, I know it's that way... but first I have to go around that big log before I can go that way!
You mustn't turn a horse so quick. That's how accidents happen.
You gotta start nice and slow. That way you get off on the right foot.
Hey! What kind of crazy horses they got in this country?
- What do you call this in Jewish?
- A tokhes.
Well, you keep your eyes on this tokhes and don't take them off till I tell you.
Keep my eyes on the tokhes...
Shee-it! Don't get no closer to that edge, Rabbi.
- What kind of word is that?
- What word?
You always say, "shee-it" at a certain moment.
Shee-it?
Well, that's a... That's a...
What do you... You must have a word in your language that you...
What do say when you get really took by surprise?
Oy gevald.
Oy gevald?
- Yeah. - That's it.
That's what "shee-it" means?
Oy, shee-it!
Yeah, that makes sense.
Slow. Slow, horsie.
Well, this is it.
- Where are you going?
- Back down the river a few miles... it's a good place to cross.
- Why not here?
- Here?
Here's a good place to die... but it ain't a good place to cross the river.
We just jump in and swim straight across. Simple as pie.
You wanna kill yourself, go ahead.
I don't like the odds.
I'm taking the long way.
Well, that shouldn't be so difficult.
Wait a minute! Where you going, horsie?
I didn't say where to go yet!
Oh, no! Oh, no!
That snake could've killed me!
Well, damn me! If he can do it, I can do it.
Help! Oy gevald!
God damn!
Shit!
You know, Rabbi, you're one crazy bastard!
Remember...
I'm the kind of person when he says he's gonna do something, he does it.
You got a guarantee, huh? He could be laying out there somewhere...
- dead in the wilderness!
- Bite your tongue!
You're talking about my future son-in-law.
Somebody, maybe, should remind Sarah Mindl.
Rosalie.
Rosalie.
- Get your sister away from that idiot!
- I'm not mixing in. I'm not mixing in.
This is a nice little town. Cold, but nice.
Yeah, I guess.
I don't think that fellow is 100%.
I'll see if I can find us some place to stay.
- Someplace pretty cheap.
- Yeah, pretty cheap.
About tomorrow morning...
This ain't traveling weather.
I know this place ain't fancy, but it's got a roof.
And like you say, it's cheap.
So we just stay here for a couple months and then head south.
No. I've wasted too much time already.
When they banged on your head, they must've mushed your brains!
So goddamned worried about time, how come you don't ride on Saturday?
I told you, it's against my religion to ride on the Sabbath.
I got me a new religion, too! And one of the things you ain't allowed to do is die!
There's real mountains out there, and that's a real blizzard building up.
- I'm telling you we can't make it.
- I can make it.
God damn! I ain't gonna let you talk me into this. It's just impossible!
Every goddamn Indian knows that!
Every goddamn trapper knows that!
I know, you don't like it when I talk that way.
But I'm telling you, you ain't gonna talk me into it this time!
Am I trying to talk you into anything?
Good night! Have a nice trip.
Good night. And thanks for everything you did for me... up until the time I needed you the most!
Don't wake me in the morning!
I'll try to be as quiet as possible!
What do you think now, Rabbi?
It's cold.
You should see it in winter.
In the Talmud it says,
"Find thyself a teacher."
And this I had done.
However, there were times I feared that he would find another pupil.
Get your horse down!
If we'd have gone on, we'd have froze to death!
No, make one!
Move! Come here... closer!
Wait.
We are doing this to keep warm, aren't we?
In that case, you can put your arms around me.
Come here, darling.
That's better.
Hey, look.
I think we've found the Garden of Eden.
Well, it ain't exactly the Garden of Eden.
What a wonderful place America is!
There are no walls around these cities.
You don't have to worry about soldiers coming in from the next town... and killing people.
You know, I think this is the West.
We're in the Wild West here, just like the books I read in Poland.
This is a wonderful city. They got banks and restaurants... they got merchants of all kinds here. And look at the people... how they're dressed. I think those are cowboys.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
Hold up here. I got a little business I wanna take care of.
Hold on to the horses, will you?
I'll be right back.
Move it!
- What's happening?
- We just robbed the bank!
- What did you say?
- We just robbed the bank!
What do you mean, "we?"
The bank, they just robbed the bank!
Oy gevald!
- We need a posse, boys, let's go!
- What for?
I said, we need a posse!
To hell with you! I ain't got any money in the bank.
- But they robbed it!
- Well go get 'em. It's your bank.
- $5 a man when we catch them !
- Not worth it...
- I'll go for $11.
- All right, you bastards...
$11. Let's go!
Don't get comfortable.
We can't stop here.
- How could you do this to me?
- It's what I do. I'm a bank robber.
- But you made me a bank robber!
- So what? You get your half.
- Get out of my life!
- What?
Get out of my life!
Get out! I don't want you here!
Get out of my life!
Take it easy!
Take it easy. You better cool off.
Guns?
You gonna shoot guns at me?
Guns!
- You know, you're really crazy.
- Sure I'm crazy. I'm a bank robber.
Who else would rob a bank but a crazy?
You, you ain't no bank robber.
All you did was hold the horses.
- Think I could tell them that?
- Sure!
- And would they listen?
- Yeah, they'll listen.
Then they'll hang you!
- And what if I gave back the money?
- You mean, your half?
- Yes, I mean my half!  - First they'll string you up by your balls... till you tell them where the other half is, then they'll hang you!
Make up your mind, pardner.
Oy gevald!
Go fast, horsie! Go fast!
Wait, Tommy, wait! I'm coming.
Looks like fresh tracks.
They was here all right. Here's some blood.
Hey, that was me. I knew I got that one.
If you did, he sure took a long time to start bleeding.
All right, let's go, men. Let's look for a tree for the hanging.
Hey. Hey!
Another river?
- I wish that we could build a bigger fire.  - Well, we can't!
We're lucky to have this much.
They ain't that far behind us.
By sunrise they're gonna catch on to my dumb-ass trick.
There, that ought to warm you up. $320 each.
Not bad, huh?
Now ain't you something.
To tell you the truth, I never figured you's gonna take the money... tainted and all, like it is.
So you're rich. What are you gonna do with it all?
When we get to the next town,
I'm going to send it back.
Well, I'd be careful till then. It's dangerous out here.
Fella could get hisself robbed.
I'll keep out a watch for strangers.
About ready.
Church over. We'd better make tracks.
I figure they know pretty much where we're at.
It ain't gonna take them too long to find us.
Hold still. Hold still, horsie. Be good.
We can't really afford such a late start.
- What the hell are you doing?
- I don't ride today.
What're you talking about?
- Today is Saturday.
- So?
- I don't ride on Saturday.
- Well, I know that. But don't tell me...
- you ain't gonna ride today?
- I ain't gonna ride today.
- I asked you not to tell me that!
- That's what I'm telling you.
But this ain't no ordinary Saturday!
Why is this Saturday different from all other Saturdays?
'Cause this Saturday, there's a hanging-posse chasing us!
I promise you. Right now, they're doubling back to that stream.
I don't ride on Saturday!
Jesus! You give me the P-doodles!
There ain't no Jews in that posse, you know!
They'd as soon string you up on Saturday as any other day!
They don't give a shit for your holiday, don't you know that?
Goddamned if I'm gonna walk!
I've asked you not to say that.
You stupid, ignorant, son of a bitch!
I ain't waiting around for that posse to find us!
- I'm leaving!
- Who's asking you to stay?
Good-bye!
There it is.
I'm gonna show you something.
Look over there.
You know what that is?
Yes.
Well?
When the sun sets.
Know what you are?
You're a real meshigoonu.
Meshuggener.
They're coming. Damn you!
- Come on.
- They're coming.
Now?
Not yet!
Now?
Not yet.
Now!
- Now!
- Thank God.
Longest damn day of my life!
That tree is a apple tree.
Hot. It's hot.
- Will you quit that! They ain't coming.
- How do you know?
'Cause it's been four days. I'm telling you they ain't coming. Now just relax.
What's that?
Them's Indians. Let's go!
Go, horsie!
Let's go! They ain't serving tea, you know, you idiot!
Go, horsie.
Shee-it!
Quick! Go quick, horse! Can't they see that we're friends?
What did they want?
They wanted our horses, our guns, our scalps, our heads.
Jesus, I don't know. They wanted our asses, that's what they wanted.
But, why? What did we do?
They've been shit on by white men so long they don't ask questions no more.
They wasn't painted up for one of your bar matzavahs, I can tell you that.
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, my God!
- What's the matter?
- Oh, my God.
- What's the matter?
- Oh, God!
- The Torah...
- Wait! Wait, damn it! Wait!
I ain't going with you this time, goddamn it!
- Let go!
- That was war paint...
- you stupid ignoramus!
- Let go!
- They won't talk, they'll just kill you!
- Will you let go?
I ain't going, you son of a bitch!
Who's asking you?
So long, sucker!
Have a nice funeral!
You dumb asshole!
Oh, come on, get me out of this.
Oh, please, please, please.
I'm your friend. I don't wanna die. Please, God...
I never did anything wrong.
How did I get into this?
- Who the hell are you?
- Me, rabbi...
Jewish rabbi.
Come from far away across big ocean.
I read much books about Indians.
You don't speak English very well.
He's a holy man, Chief. Speaks to the spirits every morning and every night.
And he's so good and kind and gentle, just a sweetheart of a man.
Why, even when we robbed the bank and the posse was chasing us... he wouldn't ride on
Saturday. No sirree!
'Cause that's his holy day and he didn't wanna make his spirits angry.
- Can he make rain?
- Rain, rain?
You should've seen the rain...
I mean buckets of rain coming down day after day.
I didn't know what the hell we were gonna do with all the stuff.
- And if you wanna talk about snow...
- Don't talk about snow!
- You came for this?
- Yes!
I have read this book.
Did not understand one word.
- What do you call this book?
- Torah.
The Torah.
Torah.
Good.
Will you trade your horse for Torah?
- Yes.
- Your horse and your boots?
- Yes.
- And your clothes?
Yes.
- And everything else you own?
- Yes, everything.
- Even your knife?
- I have no knife.
No knife!
- You have no knife?
- No.
If I give you back Torah... will you purify your soul through fire?
Yes.
Shit!
If I let you go, may I keep Torah?
No!
Rabbi with no knife, you are a brave man.
And you, who speak to Indians as if to little children... your heart is big, not as big as your mouth...
Well...
...but you have good feelings inside.
Thanks, Chief, thanks very much.
Thanks.
You should just be healthy, and that's the most important thing.
Now this is a good drink.
Great spirit, send us rain.
Wonderful! Wonderful and nice dancing.
Nice does not make rain. Yes or no, can your God make rain?
- Yes.
- But he doesn't.
- That's right.
- Why?
- Because that's not his department!
- But if he wanted to, he could?
- Yes!
- What kind of God do you have?
- Don't say, "my God." He's your God, too!   - Don't give him to us... we have enough troubles with our own gods.
- But there's only one God.
- What does he do?
He can do anything!
Then why can't he make rain?
Because he doesn't make rain! He gives us strength when we're suffering.
He gives us compassion when all that we feel is hatred!
He gives us courage when we're searching around... blindly like little mice in the darkness! But he does not make rain!
Of course, sometimes just like that... he'll change his mind.
- This is really good fruit.
- Watch out for that stuff.
What's the matter with you? I love this fruit.
- It ain't fruit! I'm telling you, watch out.  - Eat.
See that?
Good! I don't know what the recipe is, but this is good.
Tell me, what do Jewish people do to express joy?
Just like the Indians, they dance, just like this.
- Show me.
- Me? Oh, I'm not a very good dancer.
- Do you feel joy?
- Yes, I do, very much.
Then show me, please.
Dance with my people.
Well, I'll take a crack!
No!
I want him to dance with you.
He is going to show you how his people dance.
Well.
Ready on the tommies?
Go!
Everybody dance always with the left foot first.
First we start slow. Then we're gonna do some nice footwork.
That's it. That's good with the hands.
Watch that lady. I think that lady's a Jewish Indian.
Just have a little fun and don't you worry what the neighbors are thinking.
Watch the lamp post.
Try to keep in time with the other boys and girls. That's it.
Just get a message from your feet.
They are talking to you all the time.
I'll tell you, if you could move the waist and the hips a little bit... you'll be very happy with the results. Then walk toward the left... the left shoulder out.
That's the way we do it in the old country.
And hold on tight. Here we go.
And don't get wet.
Move a little faster, faster. Listen to the beat.
Steady, hold, careful, let you down. Get ready, let's jump.
Now we do a jump, a little bitty jump. That's the way we do it.
Try a little jumping, one, two, three.
And get ready for a trick. Here we go.
Clap your hands, both sides, one, two, three, four.
Clap right. Clap left, one, two, three, four.
Clap right. Clap left. I think you got it now. You got the swing of it.
One, two, three, four, clap right, clap left.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Hello.
Am I in the right place?
I hear bells.
Oy vey.
Am I?
Is this?
I'm not...
I think I was a little sick. Wasn't I?
You want to ask me anything?
- He can't, cuz.
- Tommy.
- How are you?
- Good.
You look a lot better. Boy, you were really out of your head last night.
You had me really worried.
Could you eat a little something?
- Always.
- Good. They're waiting breakfast for us.
Leave that Torah here, it'll be safe.
I've had enough trouble with that Torah.
- You're okay, huh?
- Yeah.
Oh, good. Boy!
Why didn't you listen to me when I tell you about that stuff?
You think I'm talking to you for my own good, I tell you...
I'm not talking to you for my own health...
What's the point of all my experience, you don't listen to me.
Come on, they're waiting breakfast.
You mean they never say anything, ever?
See, once they take the vow, they stop talking. I mean... not one word. There's an old man here, Father Joseph...
- he ain't spoken in 45 years.
- 45 years?
What... How do they...
What if they're playing cards and they wanna ask their partner something... what do they do? 45 years?
How can you live that long... without ever asking a person one question?
Good!
I like this food.
I know not to ask any questions.
Don't worry, I understand.
Do you grow these right...
Sorry, sorry.
I understand, no talking.
It's just that I'm not used to this, you know?
Would you please...
The salt.
Pass the salt, please!
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
You did it, didn't you?
You gave them back the money.
- Yup.
- Yup.
Well, that ain't the American way.
What's more, now you ain't got no money. Well, now what you gonna do?
Don't know.
You don't know? Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do...
I'm gonna get me a bath, then I'm gonna get drunk... then I'm gonna catch me a whore with great big tits... then I'm gonna get drunk again... then I'm gonna rob that Wells
Fargo office and get my money back.
You dumb-ass Jew!
Evening.
Evening.
We don't allow dancing in the street.
You wanna dance, you go on over to the saloon.
Oh, thanks.
- Evening.
- Evening.
Hello.
- Hope you don't mind if I watch.
- Stranger in town?
- Welcome to the Red Dog.
- I like your piano playing.
Ain't you got the darndest...
You won again, Matt.
No more bets, please.
Hey, what the hell you doing, mister?
Would you hold this for me, please?
Well, I'd...
All right, the wheel waits for no man.
- Come on, Matt.
- Place your bets.
- You're on a winning streak.
Let's go for it.  - Place your bets.
Let's go. Come on.
Let it ride, all right.
One, red. A winner, he wins again.
I want back my money.
I know you from someplace, don't I?
You must be loco, mister.
I want my $200.
Piss off.
All right, all right.
No more bets, please. That's good there. No more bets.
I can't believe it.
If he's smart, he'll leave right now.
Looks like big trouble.
I don't want to hurt nobody.
I just want my money.
We gonna kill you.
That there is just to get your attention.
Better stay on the floor.
Pretend you're hurt.
You ready, Mr. Jones?
Oh, I'm ready.
Now I remember you.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
Put him on the bar.
He's going to do the beer barrel.
We haven't done that one in a couple of months.
Now, come on now, don't mess up his funny beard.
He'll break the bucko's face.
Don't break the bar.
I hope he's got enough money to pay for this.
Nobody move.
You... put $200 on the bar.
You know where the next one's going.
Yes, sir.
And you...
- how much you got?
Get it up there.
Put the barrel down now.
Now... the three of you... go away.
Leave the rest.
Yes, sir.
You're a rich man.
I got your $200 back.
Your friends just left.
Well, in that case... let's go out and have a little fun.
I'm game.
Well, cuz, we made it.
See, it's just like I told you... right at that big tree... then left for a couple days, sharp right... and then as straight as piss till you come to the ocean.
Who would've dreamed it could be so simple.
Yeah.
If you don't know me next time you see me...
I'm gonna kick your ass all the way back to Poland.
Why wouldn't I know you?
- You going away someplace?
- Well, yeah.
This is where we say goodbye, Avram.
What do you mean?
Well, you follow that beach for a day and a half, you'll be in San Francisco.
You don't need me no more.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going that way.
Sutter's Mill.
That's where the gold is.
But I don't want you to go.
- Well, I got to go.
- Why?
Well, I got people to see... banks to rob, you know, I... got to make a living.
Who's going to be the best man at my wedding?
Well, what do you mean? That's for one of your Jewish friends.
You got to pick your best friend for that.
You...
You are my best friend.
I'm your best friend?
You're my only friend.
Now listen to me, cuz...
you keep your eyes on this tokhes... and don't you take them off till we get to San Francisco!
I never had a best friend.
I got a bank robber, a bank robber... you think a bank robber is stronger than God?
I'm a rabbi! I can beat any bank robber!
Swimming lesson's over.
Look at them. Mermaids out of the ocean. Caught with their pants off.
It's time for a little comeuppance, boys!
Damn you, horse!
Whoa ! Whoa, now!
He's out of bullets!
He dropped the gun!
Get the gun! Shoot him !
There, right there, look! It's in the sand!
Don't let him grab the other gun!
Shoot him ! He's gonna kill us! Shoot him !
Shoot him, Avram !
He's going for the other gun!
Shoot him for Christ's sake! Shoot him !
Help me!
He's gonna kill us, shoot him !
Shoot him, Avram ! Shoot him !
Don't you understand! He's going for the other gun!
Don't let him grab that gun!
Don't let him grab the other gun!
There, see right there!
Look, it's in the sand!
Shoot him, Avram ! Shoot him !
It only looks bad, cuz.
I've been hurt worse before.
Give me the whiskey.
Get the saddle bags.
I'll show you how to fix me up.
All right?
You never killed a man before, huh?
Get me the saddlebag!
Now go to sleep.
You're still acting kind of funny.
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm fine. You go to sleep now.
Hey, Rabbi... you think God sent me to show you the way?
Perhaps.
I must be some kind of angel.
- Well, it's sure a pretty day, ain't it?
- Yes.
It's a beautiful day.
Howdy.
Hello.
Howdy.
Howdy. How do... Hello there.
Do you want something?
Well, do I want?
No! Well, gol dang it, ma'am, my name is Tommy Lillard... and I come from the
Texas. I come from Texas.
Excuse me, if I gave you a little startle there. I was... a little startled there for a second.
What do you want?
Well, I came to bring this thing here for... for Mr. Bender, iffing I got the right house and all.
You do, I'm his daughter.
Yes, I know that. Oh, you're the daughter?
You are the Bender daughter! Oh!
Howdy.
Would you care to come in?
Well, I would like to, but thanks, no, because I got a friend... waiting at the saloon and... my other friend, the rabbi, asked me to bring this here to you.
- I mean, bring this to your father.
- What is it?
This thing? I don't know. I think it's some kind of Torah.
A Torah?
- Yeah, I think that's what he called it.
- So, where is he?
- Who?
- The rabbi.
Where is the rabbi? Oh, where is the rabbi, the rabbi.
Well, I don't rightly know, ma'am.
The last time I seen him I was busting my britches in the cathouse.
And, my friend, the rabbi, asked me if I should ever come Frisco way... would I drop by this house and do him this favor.
Anyway, it was nice to... make your acquaintance, ma'am.
I'd...
Is something wrong?
No, no.
It's just I didn't know that your eyes would be so brown.
How would you know that?
How would I know that?
How would I know that? That's right. How could I know that?
I couldn't know that. Well...
I'd better get going.
I hate to keep my sidewinder waiting.
So, I'll just give you that to give to your father.
Oh, wait. Papa !
Oh, no, no, don't call the papa !
I'd really better get my ass out of here. So, thanks.
- And adios for everything.
- Wait.
Wait, please. Papa ! Wait!
Wait!
Papa?
You ain't gonna eat none of this?
I don't understand you, man.
If you don't eat, you're gonna sure lose your strength.
This a good piece of meat.
You ought to have something.
Got to eat something. Thank you.
Gracias.
Now look, you go up and change.
And then we'll go together... and we'll tell your people that the new rabbi has arrived. All right?
I told you that I can't be a rabbi.
Don't you tell me that!
Just don't say that again!
Not after what I've been through to get your goddamn ass here alive!
If you hadn't shot that man, we'd both be dead!
Do you understand that, you ignorant asshole?
You do understand that?
He was gonna kill you, then he was gonna kill me. Am I right?
When you shot that son of a bitch, that was not a sin!
Then what the hell are we talking about?
When those men were shooting at you...
I ran to save the Torah.
So? I understand that.
- You're a man of God. I understand that.
- I wasn't thinking about God.
I didn't do it because of God.
I don't know one thing about God.
I was thinking about a book.
I cared more for a book than
I did for my best friend.
I don't know if you can understand that.
I don't want to insult you, but do you understand what I mean?
I chose a piece of paper, instead of you.
But I forgive you.
I know that you do.
But you're a good man.
I am a good man. I am.
But I'm not a rabbi.
You don't say that!
- Tommy, I'm not a rabbi.
- Don't say that!
You are a rabbi.
I'm a bank robber. I'm a card player and a whore-monger.
That's what I am.
You are a rabbi.
You can fall in the mud, you can slip on your ass... you can travel in the wrong direction.
But even on your ass, even in the mud... even if you go in the wrong direction for a little while, you're still a rabbi!
That's what you are!
Right?
If I'm who I am, how come you ain't what you are?
You're just too goddamn good to have the same rules.
Now you answer me.
You look me in the eye and you answer me.
Don't you dare sit there and not answer me!
You'd better have an answer for me!
Is this the place?
This doesn't look like a place that a rabbi...
Maybe Rosalie made a mistake.
We don't belong in here. Come, Benjamin.
Look at those funny-looking people.
Those dresses look like they came from Europe.
What's he talkin' about?
What's he talkin' about?
He wants to know if you're the rabbi.
Me?
You tell 'em.
I'm the rabbi.
You're the rabbi?
Funny, you don't look like a rabbi.
I just traveled 3,000 miles across this country... and I was thanking my best friend for getting me here alive!
My name is Avram Belinski... and I come from a small village in Poland... and don't you judge people by their appearance!
- We have a rabbi!
- We have a rabbi!
Excuse me, Rabbi, please forgive me.
I am very, very happy to see you.
- Let's have a drink, for God's sake.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Who's paying?
Take from the building fund. Everybody to the bar!
Pardon me, everybody, please, please make a little room here.
Thank you. I'm so sorry to spoil your...
Bartender, drinks for all my friends.
- Well, what'll you have?
- Straight whiskey!
Whiskey for everybody!
Rabbi, this is Mrs. Bender.
Welcome. Welcome, Rabbi.
And, this is my younger daughter, Rosalie.
I know that in our marriage agreement...
I mentioned my other daughter, Sarah Mindl.
- But what difference does it make...
- Papa !
You know, your father thinks that... you can just switch one promised-wife for another promised-wife... but I know that it isn't that way in America.
So, please don't feel... obligated in that way.
Wouldn't you like to dance with me?
I would. I would love to dance with you.
But, you know, a rabbi shouldn't do that.
A rabbi can dance with his fiancée, can't he?
Bartender!
Yes.
You get out here!
Yes.
Now, you listen good!
That man killed my brother.
Me and him gonna have a fair fight.
There ain't gonna be no advantage taken here.
We're going outside.
Bartender, I just want it down for the record... this gonna be a fair fight.
Rabbi.
Rabbi, let's go.
No more killing.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
Please, don't do this.
It'd be terrible if some innocent people in here got hurt, wouldn't it?
Huh, Rabbi?
Is what he says true?
Is it?
All right, get outside, both of you.
Go somewhere else.
Rabbi... you got a gun?
Well, there you go.
Well, don't worry.
You know this gun.
This is the one you used to kill my brother Darryl with.
There gonna be no advantage taken here.
There.
Just like a man.
Make your move!
Well, don't just stare at me!
You ain't gonna get away with it like that!
Draw, you stinking coward!
You yellow bastard! Draw!
You draw or I'm gonna bash your head in!
That was just to get your attention!
Now listen to me!
The war is over!
You understand that?
No more killing!
You reach for that pistol again and I'll blow your head off!
This ain't your fight!
This is my fight!
But he killed my brother, and I'm gonna kill him !
You and your partner and your pig-faced brother... ambushed us on the beach... and if the rabbi hadn't pulled the trigger... you'd have shot us both in cold blood!
Reach for it! Please!
Wait a second.
Now wait a second.
Let's talk this over.
I'm not a rabbi for nothing, you know.
I think I have a solution.
Just wait a second.
This is a very big country.
I'll tell you what I think is the best thing.
I'll take San Francisco... you take the rest of America... and if you ever come back to this place again...
I don't think you're gonna get off so easy.
Now get the hell outta here.
Would somebody please show this poor asshole the way out of town?
Mazel tov!
I've crossed rivers and I've climbed high mountains...
and I was captured by wonderful Indians.
I did so many things.
God has truly blessed me.
And what's more...
how many rabbis can say that they had a bank robber for a best man?
Mazel tov!
Music, Maestro, please!
English
John Buckman:
Well, I mean, I don't know, but they say that's what he said.
Mornin', pa.
- I know what he said.
- Oh, mornin...
If he said...
John: If he does...
Mornin', Paul.
What he says, well...
Then, what do you...
What do you aimto do about it?
What would you like me to do?
Well, hell, he's... he's, uh...
He's... he's got 3,000 head of sheep there, pa, and he's braggin' about grazin' "em on r-bar grass.
I... I think there's, uh...
What?
Only one thing to do.
What's that?
Run 'em off...
Pa, just run "em off, that's all.
Hmm.
A man's that crazy, you're probably right.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Meanwhile, we got lot of work ahead of us, you eat up and let's get to it.
Heh.
Paul: Pass the eggs, little brother.
Eggs!
Man: How 'bout some more coffee?
Second man: All right.
Hyah!
Come on, move on, move on.
Let's go.
Git on!
Hyah!
Move. Move on out!
Hyah!
Yaa. Yaa!
Good evenin", Nell.
It's been a long, hard day.
Good god almighty.
Now, what the hell happened?
He just went loco.
He started kickin', snappin...
Paul: He's dead, pa.
Man: Damn jughead.
I warned Barney yes...
All right. Let's get doin" what we're supposed to do.
Bodine, you and Post take him into town.
Get a blanket.
I'll get his stuff together and go into town tomorrow to make arrangements.
Any family?
Well, he talked about an uncle in muskogee.
- Good man.
- Yeah.
Get another. With roundup in a few days, we need him.
Ok.
Paul! What the hell's the matter with you?
What'd I do?
You know,
I been thinkin' about what happened.
It just don't make no goddamn sense to me.
I mean, one minute there's Barney, and the next...
Because some goddamn loco jughead...
You know, what I'm tryin' to say is...
I can't even get the way to say it.
Yeah, 'cause it don't seem real.
Oh, it sure don't.
You know, somethin' like that happens...
Somethin' that a man's got no control over.
Somethin' that he'll never understand no matter what way he looks at it.
Like a really bad, crazy dream.
Yeah.
And it can scare hell outta you, too.
You know, the thing that scares a man the most is to find out and discover just how uncertain life really is.
Like that, you know, thing happened to Barney.
Realizin', even if he don't want to admit it, that deep down in his gut it just as easy could've been him and might be, any minute, any second.
Crazy jughead.
Somethin' like that.
Of course, it's natural to chew on it.
But sooner or later you just gotta get rid of it and get on with what you got.
Ain't nothin' much you can do about it anyway.
Ain't nothin' much?!
Ain't nothin"!
Gotta do the best with what you got while you got it.
Ain't that the way you see it, Ross?
Sure is the way I see it.
You scared of dyin'?
Yeah, kinda.
Except, I sure as hell don't spend much time thinkin' about it.
Yeah, me either.
No.
Uhh!
Wow!
Hah! Hmm, mmm.
Yeah, that banker man's got himself a real nice woman.
Yeah, but about 5 years she won't be lookin' so nice, and that banker man is gonna see you walkin' down the street some day with a sassy young thing, and he's gonna say to himself,
"mmm, that cowboy's really got himself a nice woman."
And he's gonna envy you somethin' fierce.
'Cause he's stuck with his, and you can just trade yours in anytime you feel like it.
Ain't you ever felt like gettin' married?
Oh, I've felt like it a hundred times, but there's a big difference between feelin' and doin...
Thank god I just been feelin...
Ain't you ever wanted to have children?
Oh, I got children.
Two I know of, and there's bound to be more.
Oh, no, I mean raise a family, settle down.
What the hell for?
You can't be a puncher all your life.
You've gotta plan for something, don't you?
You never been to Mexico, huh?
There's a place down there that a man with a little money can get himself a damn fine spread.
Plenty of people to get the work done.
Lots of time for lyin' around soakin' up the sun, lovin' those young, black-eyed beauties.
Sounds good.
Yeah.
You savin' your money?
Ha ha. You savin' yours?
Shoot! I try.
I can't seem to save nothin...
Why should I be any different?
Because you're...
I'm older, wiser. I've learned.
I've had experience.
- Yeah.
- Hell, Frank, you show me a young cowboy or an old cowboy or an in-between cowboy that's got more than a few dollars in his poke, and I'll show you a cowboy who stopped bein' a cowboy and started robbin' banks.
Well, then let's you and me
Rob us a bank.
That's safer than gettin' married.
- Get up, there!
- Mmm.
Get up, there!
Dear lord, we thank you for this food we are about to receive, and we pray that you take our recently departed friend
Barney Drago into your loving care and keep him safe.
Amen.
Soup.
Well, here's to Barney.
Poor bastard.
But you know, if it's gotta happen...
I'd rather have it happen like that.
You know, quick like, so you don't think about it beforehand.
You know what?
You know what?
I'm really gettin' drunk.
Congratulations.
I am gettin' too drunk.
I ain't had nothin' to eat since breakfast, you know.
Neither have I.
I can't handle a whole lot of whiskey unless I got somethin' solid in my stomach first.
I don't wanna spoil your fun or nothin', but if I don't eat pretty soon...
Now, look, you're not gonna spoil my fun. Come on.
Get you a big steak.
Well, we'll come right back to it.
Maybe we'll stop off at Maybell's.
Well, why not? I ain't had none of that for a while, either.
But I want us to have one drink first, see.
Are you sure?
One drink's ok because it sort of makes my appetite a little sharper.
I can tell just exactly when I'm ready... wait.
Uh, this one's to you, Ross, and to Mexico...
And to, uh, that ranch you're gonna have yourself someday.
To someday.
Somethin' stinks in here.
Well, it ain't me, Ross.
Smells like sheep.
I think we'd better have one more.
Oh, shit.
Good evening.
Ross, the man here...
I believe he wants to talk to you.
Oof!
- You ok?
- Yeah, I'm ok.
You son of a bitch.
Aah! You goddamn animal!
Ooh! Ooh!
Why, you miserable...
Get outta here.
Thanks, Dave.
Don't mention it, Ross.
You all right, partner?
Unh!
Ooh.
Good job, Frank.
Dave: Art, gimme a hand with the big red.
He's stuck on the wall.
God damn it. I no sooner get this place all fixed up...
I'm an old Texas cowboy
far away from home
if I ever get home to Texas
I never again will roam
Montana's too damn cold for me
and the winters are so long
before the roundup will begin
my money is all gone
I've worked down in Nebraska...
Ohh.
Is there anything here for me?
Oh, that sheepherder Hansen and a couple of his men are clutterin' up the place, that's all.
Bodine?
Huh? Mmm, howdy, sheriff.
You look a mite peaked.
You want to spend the night in town?
I can fix you up with a cell.
No, I'm just gonna lie here and rest my way back to health.
Now, look, we're gonna be just fine.
You just point us in the right direction.
Hyah, yah!
Oh, god. Am I sick.
Yeah, well, there's one thing for certain...
What's that?
It can't get any worse.
Frank: Goddamn!
Bodine.
Bodine.
Yeah.
Hey, Bodine,
- huh?
- Wake up. Wake up.
Come on, wake up, Bodine.
Oh...
What the hell did you two get into last night?
You stink like a couple of rancid polecats.
Better wash off and change right quick, or you're gonna miss breakfast.
Flapjacks and sausage.
Oh, god.
Giddyap!
Oh! Unh!
What the hell you doin' down there?
Come on!
Giddyup.
Mayden's a cow town, and most of it was built with r-bar money.
It's your town, but if you kill somebody, you're gonna be arrested...
And if you bust up the saloon, you're gonna have to pay for it.
I'll have a talk with Dave and see what he figures the damages comes to, and then I'll, uh, oh, I'll take somethin', just a little somethin' each month from your pay.
West fence.
Yeah, I bet he...
Busted a couple of saloons in his time.
More than a couple, and he probably paid for 'em, too.
Sheriff.
Walt: Bill!
Hansen: He ain't in here.
Well, if it ain't the big man himself.
Hansen, you've been spoutin' off your mouth.
Now I've got somethin' to say.
If you set one foot on r-bar land, if one sheep grazes one blade of r-bar grass, you're dead.
Bill Jackson!
Sheriff!
Bill: Who is it?
It's Walt Buckman.
Come out here!
All right, all right.
I'm coming.
Oh, god damn it!
Woman: Hey, where ya goin' with the blanket?
- Come on.
- Whoa!
Gimme that...
Get back in, for Christ's sake.
Oh, Walt.
Ugh. What can I do for ya?
I want you to turn Hansen loose.
I gave him fair warnin', so if he's gonna start somethin', let's get it over with.
All right.
I'll see you for supper Saturday.
Hyah! Hy-hy-hy-hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah hyah!
Hyah hyah!
Hey, Bodine?
Yeah?
I been thinkin'...
How old are you?
I'll be 46 in July.
I'll be 50 in July.
Jesus.
Phew.
Why?
Well, in another 25 years,
I'm gonna be just like you.
Well, what's wrong with that?
Well, I'd rather be rich.
I'd rather have that ranch and all them pretty girls now than bust my butt, and break my bones punchin' cows for the next 25 years.
You got a point.
Well, then, let's you and me ride into town tonight and Rob us that bank.
Oh. Oh, it's you, huh?
Uh, how do you feel?
I feel fine, pa. Why?
Ooh, uh, I was just thinkin...
I'm goin' to St. Louis the end of the month...
Wanna come along?
Well, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Spend a couple of weeks.
Take care of some business.
Have a little fun.
Listen, can I tell you for sure about...
About what?
It's about St. Louis. I mean...
You don't have to make up your mind right away.
I'm goin'. I gotta go.
I gotta take care of things.
I'd love to have you come if you feel like.
If you don't, there's no sweat.
Strictly up to you.
Yeah.
Aah!
Whoo.
What's that? What's, uh...
Walt: What's what?
What's up to him this time?
He's making up his mind if he wants to come with me to St. Louis or not.
Oh, he is, huh?
Yes, he is.
Somethin' wrong with St. Louis...
Hell, no, John, it's just...
Would you like to come?
Hell, yeah, I'd like to come. Shoot, he's...
I knew you would, yeah.
You did?
Where the hell they goin'?
Town, I expect.
Hey, where you goin', Bodine?
Ross: To town.
Well, what the hell for?
We got roundup tomorrow.
We'll be back in time.
I never knew of old Bodine goin" to town except Saturday nights since I knowed him.
Well, he sure went to town last night.
No, no, I mean of his own hoof, pa.
Walt: Yeah, I know what you mean.
Hey...
I bet I know what he's up to.
Damn you, boy.
Supper's ready.
Uh-heh. Comin...
You decide to come along, and, uh...
I'll get that new saddle for ya.
What, what?
What, what?
Joe: Who's there?
Bill Jackson.
Oh, it's the sheriff.
Hey...
Maybell Tucker is bringin' in a new chippy from Kansas City...
Watch your mouth.
Well, it's, uh...
That's why them...
Them two went to town, pa.
That's not somethin' we talk about in front of your mother.
Sorry.
Don't be so rough on him, Walt.
He's a man now.
Then he oughta have a little more respect.
I know about Maybell Tucker.
Well, that's not the point...
Is it, Nell?
No, I guess it isn't.
Look, isn't this...
It's awaste of time talkin',
Joe. Wait till you get it done.
The less chance there is of somethin' goin' wrong and everybody bein' unhappy.
Come here. Come here.
Yeah, good old thing.
Well, you look like you just had yourself a whole bunch of pups.
How long ago she had the pups?
Well, it couldn't have been too long ago.
You're still full of milk. Let's see.
Mmm. Right sweet, yeah.
A lot of people have their life savings in that bank.
Yes, ma'am, I...
See, I... I can't honestly get too upset about it,
'cause I ain't never done nothin' like this before.
I sure ain't expectin' on doin' it again, either.
That doesn't make it right.
No, no, but when I...
When I think about all the stuff I'm gonna do with that money, it don't make it all that wrong, either.
Yeah.
Now, listen, when we get to town, the first thing you do is go right to the bank, and if anybody asks you what you're doin', you got an answer?
No, I never go to the bank at night.
Well, you'd better think of somethin...
You know you're not gonna get away with it.
Well, the way I look at it, Joe, it's kinda up to you whether we get away with it or not,
'cause when you consider what's at stake...
I mean, all that money, your wife, your family, things like that...
You'd better play it pretty smart.
But all I meant was that even if you did get the money, sooner or later, they're bound to catch up with you.
You just concentrate on gettin' the money.
I'll worry about gettin' caught.
Johnny.
Johnny!
She ain't even due in till next week.
You wanna bet on that?
I'll bet she got in early, and them two horny cowboys found out about it, heh.
Why would Maybell say she's due in next week if she ain't due in next week, huh?
Naw. Maybe Maybell don't tell nobody else, but she'd tell Bodine.
You know how fired up she gets every time that old stud Bodine gets around.
You believe all that bodine bullshit?
I surely do.
You comin' with me or ain't you?
- Wait a minute, John.
- Come on.
Paul: Trust me, John.
Now, I'm your brother.
John: Yeah, I know you're my brother,
I can trust you'll buy that round.
Come on, John.
Goin' to town to see what Post and Bodine are up to.
Yeah, pa.
What so special about
Kansas City chippies, Paul?
Oh, hell, John, I don't know.
It's just a damn woman.
Roundup starts tomorrow morning.
Your boys are more interested in a 2-bit whore from Kansas City.
Why is it whenever they do something you disapprove of, they're always "my boys?"
Because if they was mine...
If they was mine,
I'd have peeled the hide off of 'em a long time ago and taught 'em the meaning of respect and responsibility...
But you raised "em, Nell. Hmm?
You raised 'em your way, so I figure you deserve the credit.
Good night.
Good night, Walt.
Chippies got marvelous legs, the highest hips, and they say the most beautiful biggest tits
I have ever seen on a woman.
The baby's hungry.
Young man.
Get out.
She has to feed the baby.
Just remember, I got your mama out here.
Good old girl.
What's up?
What's up?
She has a litter of puppies under the porch.
I expect she wants out.
- Big litter?
- 11. 3 died.
Ok.
That's it.
I raise.
Oh, hiya, Ross.
Howdy, Dave.
Uh-huh.
Sorry about last night.
Yeah? Well, let me tell you somethin...
You got somethin' to be sorry about.
Well, you know somethin'?
You hit pretty hard.
Oh, I do, do I?
Well, what's your pleasure this time?
Whiskey.
Woman: Aw, come on.
Man: I gotta get home.
Woman: Oh, I don't think so.
Come on, Kevin.
I am Jose.
Woman: Oh, well, no, you're not.
You gimme those.
Woman: No.
What did you say your name was?
I hear Barney Drago got himself killed.
Yeah, he got, uh, jammed up in a corral.
Horse kicked him.
Tch. Can't trust them jugheads.
I had me one once...
You know, with that faraway look in his eye?
Tch. Bad.
Sure can take a man to some crazy places.
Yeah.
I knowed the first time
I swung a leg over his ugly hide, he was out to get me...
And you know, he didn't give a good goddamn if he got hisself while he's doin' the gettin', either.
Man had any sense, he'd, uh, save his money and get into some other kinda work.
Yeah...
But where are you gonna find a cowboy that's got any sense?
That's true.
Another one, Dave.
What the hell did he tie you up for out here?
Didn't he know there's a bank robbery goin' on?
Woman: Hey, Luann, you gonna play or not?
Second woman: What?
You gonna play stud?
Sure.
Bodine: Joe? Open up.
Joe: It's open.
Hey, looks like they're here, all right.
You're damn right, they is.
The horses is.
There's old Charley boy.
Yeah, that don't mean a thing if that Kansas City chippy's not here.
She's here.
Those sons of bitches.
Don't let it bother you.
We're goin' to the sheriff, and then you're gonna convince your partner to release my family.
I should've listened to Frank. He said that if I left you alone for a few seconds you'd try to do something foolish, and here I was givin' you credit for havin' more sense.
You tell Frank if he doesn't hurt anybody,
I won't prosecute.
You and him can just clear out. Take off.
And you got my word.
The law won't touch you.
Well, under the circumstances,
I'd say that's a pretty fair proposition.
But, I'd like it a whole lot better if the sheriff was sayin' them words.
Hold it!
Joe, you know as well as I do the sheriff's not gonna make any promises like that, leastwise none that he's gonna keep.
No, as far as I'm concerned, the sheriff's out.
Then I've got no choice.
Well, that's a damn shame...
For both of us.
I don't care what kind of a man he is, he's not gonna hurt a little baby.
You're probably right, Joe...
But he'll kill your wife without even battin' an eye.
Mr. Buckman, if Ross Bodine and Frank Post was here...
What the hell are their goddamn horses doin'...
I don't know what the hell their horses are doin' out front, but they ain't in here!
Bullshit.
Come on, Maybell.
This is my house, Mr. Buckman, and when you call me a liar, honey, you ain't welcome.
Get.
Come on, Joe.
Yeah.
You a drinkin man, Joe?
- What?
- I mean, what do you do when you ain't workin' at the bank? Eh, you go fishin'?
What are you getting at?
Oh, nothin' in particular.
I just thought it'd look a lot less suspicious if we was havin' a friendly conversation.
Last time I went fishin' is when I was a kid down in Del Mar, Texas.
Daddy used to take me out to the creek on Sunday afternoons after church, and...
I'd sit there and fish all afternoon while he smoked his smelly old pipe.
I mean, it'd get dark, and he'd even light a lantern.
Woman: I'm tellin' ya, don't let me be tellin' ya all week.
They ain't due till next week.
Probably after Wednesday.
John: Hey, bodine!
Who's that?
Well, it looks like young Johnny Buckman.
What does he want?
He'll let us know when he gets here.
You just take it easy and let me do the talkin...
What's up, Johnny?
You know, uh, Joe Billings.
Joe: Mr. Buckman.
Joe. Uh, where the hell is, uh, Post?
Walt: Last time I saw him, he was headin' into Maybell's.
Why?
Well, that's his horse, isn'tit?
Oh, yeah, uh...
Joe's horse, uh, cast a shoe, and Rufus Coleman was havin' supper.
Couldn't get it shod for a couple hours, so Joe was worried about gettin' home too late, and Frank loaned him
Charley boy...
And he was more than happy to spend some more time at Maybell's.
Anything wrong?
No, no, no. I, uh...
Well, I just thought you and Post had come into town to get a crack at that new chippy that Maybell's bringin' in from Kansas City.
Well, she's not due for another week.
Yeah, yeah, right.
I thought, uh...
What the hell was all that with Maybell?
What did she lie to me for?
Said that, uh, she hadn't seen Post.
He wasn't there.
Well, I'll be damned.
That's peculiar,
'cause he's there.
Son of a bitch.
I'll see you at the ranch.
Sure, Johnny.
You know, there's one thing you can count on with young John.
He's got a short fuse.
When it starts smokin', he doesn't spend too much time figurin' things out.
He's liable to wreck the place.
Well, whatever he does, he's liable to keep a lot of people busy for quite a spell...
Includin' the sheriff.
Get your lyin' ass out here, Maybell!
No 2-bit whore slut's gonna lieto John Buckman and get away with it!
I wait all goddamn night for a hand like that, and then some inconsiderate son of a bitch has gotta decide to shoot up the son-of-a-bitchin' town.
I know Frank Post's in there,
I'm gonna find out why the hell you say he ain't.
All right, Maybell, you get your ass out here.
Hey, post ain't in there, huh?
What's going on here?
I don't know. I was asleep.
You crazy bastard!
You cut loose with that 6-gun just one more time,
I swear I'll let you have both barrels.
Why'd you tell me you haven't seen Frank Post?
Because I haven't!
Bullshit!
You "bullshit" me one more time,
John Buckman, and it'll be your last bullshit!
He's in there right now.
He ain't!
And even if he was, why would I say he wasn't?
Well, that's what I'm trying to find out, dummy!
John, hold it, brother. Hey, you're spoiling a whole lot of good fun now.
Bodine says Post is in there right now.
John, what the hell difference does it make?
It makes a hell of a lot of difference,
'cause something's going on around here!
John! No!
That ought to convince him.
If it doesn't, shoot his horse.
- Shoot his horse?
- Ah, then shoot him.
But you've got to explain it to his pappy.
John: That wasn't too goddamn funny!
Ha ha ha!
Maybell: Now, what is this?
What's going on?
Frank?
Hey, Ross, is that you?
Yeah. Me and Joe Billings.
Joe: What is it? What's wrong?
Cougar.
I hurt him, but I don't think he's dead.
So you be real careful where you put your foot down.
Where's Sada and the baby?
They're in the house.
Stop worrying about your family, and you start concentrating on that cat.
Hey, Ross, he's a big one.
Tried to get that ol' bitch and her pups.
Put up quite a fight
'fore he killed her.
You stop talking.
We're coming in.
Easy now, Joe.
Unh.
You all right?
Yeah.
Damn!
How'd it go?
Oh, a few bright moments.
Beginning to give me a headache.
Oh, I don't wonder.
How much?
Holy sweet love of Jesus!
I'm comin' up all over in duck bumps.
Whew.
Oh. Oh. God.
Molly Brown is dead.
Don't look. She's all mangled.
- There's a box in...
- Yes.
The kitchen.
You all right?
Sada: Jenny's sleeping.
We need 2 horses and supplies, Joe.
Help me bury her.
Yeah, sure.
We've only got one horse.
Go with Joe and get the horse.
I'll do the burying.
No! I don't want you to bury them.
If you won't let Joe help me, then I'll manage alone.
Where's the horse?
Out back by the lean-to.
If anybody shows up, get 'em into the house pronto.
Don't forget your hat.
Il trust ya.
Hey, Joe, I've been thinkin...
How much the boys at the r-bar gonna be out come payday?
Uh, 23... no, 2,500.
Mm-hmm.
Oh.
Well, there's 3,000.
That's 2,500 for the r-bar and 500 for you and your family.
Ross and me get plenty, and, uh...
Well, you know, it's one thing stealin' from strangers and fellas you hardly know well enough to say howdy to, but, uh, those punchers out at r-bar, they've been pretty good compadres.
Frank: Hey, Ross, let's go!
Right!
Now, you understand I'm not trying to cancel out any friendships.
As matter of fact, if I'm lucky,
I'll pick up a few.
We don't want the 500.
Aw, now come on, Joe, take it.
Now, you and your family kind of got the shi...
Well, uh, the dirty end of the stick tonight, and you earned it.
We didn't earn anything.
We didn't do anything willingly.
Frank: Hey, Ross!
Yeah?!
Shh.
Look, I don't care what you do with it,
'cause I ain't got time to argue.
But you be sure those boys at r-bar get this with the compliments of Frank Post and Ross Bodine!
I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble.
Trouble?!
What, they givin' ya a farewell party or somethin'?
I just left 'em something so they wouldn't forget us.
Since when did bank robbers have trouble being remembered?
Oh. Uh, Walter...
Easy, boy.
Easy, boy. Whoa, boy.
Whoa, boy.
Come on.
It's Charley boy.
Belongs to Frank Post.
Somethin' sure scared him.
You said Johnny and Paul rode out after Frank Post and Ross Bodine.
Yeah. Well, that don't mean much.
It turnin' cold, huh?
You ought to put more on.
At least, uh, put somethin' more around your shoulders.
I didn't know you were awake.
Yeah.
Would you like me to fix you some chocolate?
Fine. Fine.
We're not gonna give it back.
They stole it.
They're gonna hang or go to prison.
Whether they gave you
$3,000 doesn't make...
Jesus Christ, sada!
God damnit to hell!
Why can't you say anything without swearing?
What do you think is the first thing they're gonna tell the sheriff when they find
I kept the whole 3,000?
They won't believe that.
Nobody'd believe that crazy story.
Well, then...
Joe, do you realize how long it would take us to save $3,000?
20 years.
Maybe never.
Yeah, but that has nothing to do with going out and stealing something.
- I'm not...
- Just please...
Go into town. Think about it.
And if you decide that you...
That you just have to tell the sheriff...
Then you bring him back here, and I'll...
I'll give it to him.
I'm only going into town, Nell.
I'll be back in time for breakfast.
Hey, where are we gonna get us another horse?
Ben's place.
That's 30 miles away.
Must be a horse closer than that.
Not for sale.
Who's talking about buying?
Ordinarily, it ain't my policy to look on the sorry side.
But if we was to get caught, we'd probably have to do about 5 years in the penitentiary for bank robbery.
Is that right?
Maybe. Maybe more.
Yeah. But for horse stealing, no maybe.
They hang you right now.
come on, you melancholy folk
wherever you may be
I'll sing about the cowboy
whose life is light and free hey, I just thought of somethin...
Benny ain't got no horses.
All he's got is mules, ain't that right?
That's right.
You expect me to ride a goddamn mule?
Well, there's nothing wrong with a good mule.
You ride him, then.
We're partners. We'll cut cards for the horse.
What for? You said yourself ain't nothin' wrong with a good mule.
That's what I said.
But if, uh,
Benny ain't got a good mule...
I mean, a real good mule.
I mean, a real good kind that there's nothin' wrong with, then we'll cut cards. All right?
Yeah.
who roams about the prairie
at night when he lies down
his heart is gay
as flowers in may
though his ass is on the ground
All right, all right. All right!
Hold your goddamn horses!
Joe: Oh, Maybell,
I'm sorry to disturb you maybell: Wait. Hello, Joe.
I'd like to help out, honey...
No, you don't understand.
I'm looking for the sheriff.
Well, the sheriff is...
No. The bank has been robbed.
Now, will you wake him up, please?
I gotta get dressed.
Maybell:
I got money in that bank.
Bill! Bill, come on, bill! Get up!
Woman: What the hell's going on?
Ah, shut up and get back to work!
Does Walt Buckman know about this?
No. Nobody does. Just me.
Bill! Bill, did you hear what I said?!
Maybell... will you get the hell out of there, or I'm gonna blow a big, fat hole in your door?
I said the bank's been robbed!
Now, you listen to me, Bill!
I helped you, you son of a bitch, get to be sheriff. And I can...
Aah!
Maybell: Goddamn son of a bitch!
Next time, you son of a bitch,
I'll see you downstairs!
Pull up.
Whoa, whoa.
Swappin' time.
Oh.
How much further?
My butt's is frayed to a faretheewell.
Oh, it's a long way.
Won't get there until afternoon.
What do you got?
Ain't he cute?
Frank, what the hell you doin' with a little pup like that?
He ain't even weened.
Well, I'll figure something out.
All we need's a little bit of milk.
Where the hell we're gonna get that?
Well, Ross,
I'm surprised at you.
Any man who can Rob bank of $36,000 should find us a teeny little bit of milk.
Sometimes, boy, you do amaze me.
Don't you love me no more?
Oh, I love ya.
I just can't figure out what the hell to do with ya.
Well, you gotta admit he is a cute one.
Yeah, he's cute.
I just couldn't resist it.
Uh-huh.
Ok.
Ooh, goddamn!
What's the matter?
He just peed my shirt.
Whoo!
Ha ha ha.
How long will it take you to round up a posse?
Well... no. God, no.
Not till, uh, 7, 8:00.
They'll be long gone.
Ever try to round up a posse before they've had breakfast?
They can't get far with one horse.
Then they'll get another horse.
I want 'em caught, Bill!
You've got your deputy.
I'll let you take my boys.
Now, the four of you ought to be able to get the job done.
Listen to me.
Sir?
I want 'em back, you understand?
Look, Walt, if I deputize your boys here, they ain't gonna have jurisdiction across that territory line.
They aren't, huh?
Well, no r-bar hand ever done anything like this before.
And it's gonna be a cold day in hell before one even thinks about trying it again.
Heh.
If the sheriff has to stop, then you keep right on goin' and bring those cowboys back, you understand?
Dead or alive?
Alive, of course!
That is, if they give you that choice.
Howdy, Ben.
Howdy, sergeant.
Ben and me was in the army together for a spell.
That ain't gonna buy you much.
Ain't gonna buy your friend nothin...
Good-natured veteran, ain't he?
We robbed us a bank last night.
My partner here's got a new little pup.
Thought you might have some milk.
Also, I'd like to make a deal with you for one of them mules.
Ha ha ha ha.
Ross: Climb down.
Ha ha ha ha.
It's all right, darlin'.
It won't be long now.
Yeah.
You still good, Ben?
Pretty good.
Good as you used to be?
My legs ain't.
Hands is.
If I had to come around all of a sudden-like,
I'd end up in a heap.
But if I'm facin' it to start with...
Hey, you scared the hell out of my dog.
Maybe you'd like to try your hand.
I gave up shootin' bottles and tin cans when I was rich enough to buy my own bullets.
It's all right, darlin...
Uh, maybe you'd like to teach us old-timers a few new tricks.
I can think of one trick you might be interested in.
Which one is that?
The one where you hurry up get my dog milk, or I step on you where it hurts.
The trick is you can't do nothin' about it,
'cause you wasted all your bullets shootin' a bunch of stupid bottles.
What do you say, sergeant?
I make it a point never to argue with an animal lover.
You can have all the milk I got.
There's your milk.
That's a cat.
Yeah. Whatever it is, you want some milk, that's where it's gonna get.
She'll take his head off.
It might not.
I heard about a bitch wolf that suckled a skunk once.
I remember, in Virginia, fox raised a litter of hounds.
Aw, Bodine, I don't...
You want that pup to live, you ain't got no choice.
Now give here. The cat knows me.
Here you are, kitty.
Look what I got you here.
New customer.
Hey, look at that.
I'll be damned.
Tell you what...
You give me the pup, and I'll give you the...
Oh, no, you don't.
You ain't gettin' that pup.
- How you gonna feed it?
- Uh, he's got a point.
I don't care...
Trade you for my best mule.
No!
You ain't gonna find no mule
'tween here and mile city.
Heh. That's a 3 good days' ridin' on 2 good horses.
We need that mule.
I need that dog.
I'll give you $20 for the cat.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- It ain't for sale.
Let's have some coffee.
How you gonna carry a cat?
You carry the cat.
I got the dog.
What will you take for the cat?
Well, what you're sayin' is, then, if you don't get the dog, we don't get the mule, huh?
That's right.
Frank: Give him the dog!
I'll ride the mule.
That's best for everyone, especially the dog.
Thanks for everything.
Be seein' ya, Ben.
Bye, sergeant.
Don't you worry, Sonny.
I'll take good care of the pup.
You do that, old-timer.
Let's go! Come on, Bodine!
They should be in Wyoming by now.
Yup. Close enough so we ain't gonna catch'em
'fore they are.
We're going back right now.
Yeah. We might as well, too, John.
We're not cut out for this kind of work.
The old man said he wanted 'em brought in.
You want to go back, you tell him that's what I'm doin'.
All right. Give him some grub and tobacco.
Don't be such a damn fool.
Now, them boys, they can be in Mexico,
Indian territory, god knows.
Now, ain't that right, sheriff?
That's right.
That's a long way, John.
Then I better get going, huh? Heh heh.
Comin'?
What you gonna do when you get born in the wrong family, huh?
Come on.
- Kind of spooky.
- Yeah.
Yeah, they haven't been grazing too well.
Put an extra man on each guard.
Yeah. That's a good idea.
If anything goes wrong, send someone in for me.
Otherwise, I'll see you bright and early.
Want somebody to ride back with you?
What for?
Nothin...
You can make me that offer after about 6 more birthdays, and not before.
Whatever you say, Mr. Buckman.
I say, "up yours."
Did he really send them 2 boys after Bodine and Post?
Well, if he did, it ain't any of your business.
Damned fool thing to do if you ask me.
Nobody asked you.
Somebody's bound to end up dead or crawlin' around, wishin' he was.
Should've left it alone.
The sheriff could've handled it.
They worked with him, and they stole his money.
A man like Buckman ain't gonna let a thing like that alone.
You still want to go on with this?
They're no better off than we are.
Now what kind of stupid argument is that now, huh?
Just 'cause they're drowning or freezing to death, that ain't no reason we got to do the same. Now, is it?
I aim to get 'em, Paul.
You got to start thinking like a reasonable human being for a change.
Well, that's our goddamn money.
We just ain't got no right.
Pa told me to do something,
I'm gonna do it.
Now, you want to go on back, just get the hell out of here or get the hell off my back!
Hey, Frank.
Wake up.
You see what I see?
Broncs.
So what?
Well, that means I'm through ridin' a mule.
Are you crazy? You gonna catch yourself a horse?
Who the hell's gonna break him?
Who the hell do you think?
Come on, saddle up the mule.
Ross, we can't stay here for...
It ain't gonna take that long. Come on!
Goddamn!
Jesus Christ.
Hold still, you jerk-headed mule.
Stay. Come.
Ok. Let's go.
Come on, now let's go.
Here we go now. Come on.
Stupid!
You dumb son of a...
Come on, now. Let's go!
Ohh, goddamn!
Stop it. Stupid...
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on.
Yee-haw!
Come on, mule, run.
Yee-haw! Yee-haw!
Go get him, Ross! Go get him!
Whoo!
I got him, Ross I got him!
I got him! Aw, shit!
No, I don't.
Frank: Yee-ooh! Yee-ooh!
Ross: Shut up and hold on.
Ross: Whoa, you bitch.
- Whoa.
- Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, ho.
Whoa.
Frank: Whoa now.
Ross: Watch your head there.
Easy.
Now hold her, Frank.
I'll get her tied up.
Hold her.
- Now watch it!
- Whoa, whoa.
Whoa now!
Whooooa!
All right, let me take her.
I'm-a go get the saddle.
You silly girl.
Ho now.
Ho now.
Ho now.
Ho now.
Easy, Daisy.
Easy.
Whoa. Whoa.
Keep bitin' on that ear.
Keep bitin'.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa, girl.
Ok, you can let her go now.
Ho now, Daisy. Ho.
How come Daisy?
First girl I was ever in love with
- when I was about 8.
- Heh.
She was a sweet little thing.
You think this one's just as sweet?
She's gonna be.
All right, Daisy, this is where you and I get engaged.
Ok, let's do it!
All right. Show me something.
Ok, Ross. Stay with it.
Beautiful! That's it, stay on her, Ross.
I bet you didn't have so much trouble when you was 8.
Stay on her! Hold on to her!
That's it! That's it!
Ride her now. Ride her!
Waltz with the lady.
Waltz with her. Whoo!
You're doin' it!
You're doin' it!
Hang onto her now!
Hold her, Ross!
Hold her! Ride her!
Waltz with the lady. Whoo!
Yee-whoo!
Yee-haw!
Yee-haw!
Yee-whoo!
Yee-haw!
Yee-haw!
Yee-whoo!
Yee-haw!
Yee-haw!
Yee-whoo!
Ho, ho, ho, lover.
God damn.
What'd I tell ya?
Whoo!
Ross: saddle me up with an old gray hack 
with a big wide seat right on his back
they padded him up good with a gunny sack
with my beddin' on
when I got on, he left the ground
went up in the air and turned around
and I busted the earth
when I came down both:
oh, what a terrible fall
now in the mornin'
if you don't die
I'll give you another horse to try
oh, can't ya let me walk, says I
oh, yes, says he, to town both:
now I've lived in cities
and I've lived in towns
I've traveled this country
all around
one thing to say
before you start
kiss your wife
insure your life
kill yourself with a pocketknife
I swear that's the best way
Ross: I wanna show you somethin...
Easy now, girl.
Easy now.
Ho now. Ho now.
Ho. Ya see.
Plum gentle.
Oh!
Ain't that just like a woman though?
Always gotta have the last word.
Ross: You know, it's growed a bit since I seen it last.
Yeah, well, seein' how you already been to Benson...
Tell ya what.
We'll draw straws to see who goes in.
Now who's gonna hold the straws?
Why, hell, there're only
2 straws. You can't cheat.
We'll cut cards.
And you're gonna shuffle?
Now whoever goes in has gotta buy a new deck of cards
'cause these feel like they been soaked in honey.
I ain't gonna look at mine yet.
Now don't you look at yours either.
Ok, you wanna trade?
- You don't trust me.
- Nope.
Well, the feeling is mutual.
Ok, then let's trade.
Nope.
You sure?
Ok, let's trade.
Ok, now what I got is yours.
What you got is mine, right?
That's right.
Ok.
8 of spades.
2 of diamonds.
God damn!
Now what we need is some grub and some tobacco...
And a new deck of cards.
How much you think
I ought to take with me?
How the hell should I know?
Take what you need.
Take the whole goddamn thing for all I care.
Don't make no goddamn bit of difference to me.
Now look...
You're just lucky that you have to stay behind because I gotta go in there and face all that temptation.
Now there's nothin' il can do about that.
I'll only be about an hour or 2.
Boy, I sure don't see why we gotta be so almighty careful.
I'd rather get caught than go on like this.
3 weeks. 3 miserable goddamn weeks.
A man could just...
What's up?
Well, I just figure it's liable to be a long time before we hit another town, and in the meantime, bitchin' to me all the way to Mexico.
So why don't we take a little bit of this and spend it...
And raise some hell?
Whoo!
Pardner, I'm gonna shoot the first man says you ain't got style.
And I'm gonna shoot the first woman.
Sure has changed a bit.
Hey, what're we gonna do first?
Find us a big bathtub.
You get a couple more buckets now, son, you hear?
- Hey, Frank.
- Mmm?
Man gets into civilization like this, he hardly knows what to do first.
Frank: Thank you.
Barber: You're welcome.
Will there be anything else, sir?
Yeah.
I want yato go out and buy these supplies
I've listed.
Mm-hmm.
What time is it?
7 minutes after 1:00, exactly.
All right. Wake me up at 6:00.
Just check on me every once in a while to see I haven't drowned.
Ahh!
Sure thing.
I'll be back soon as I can now, son.
You take care of 'em.
Yes, pa.
Is that ok?
Perfect.
Oh.
Hey, Ross.
What d'ya think the poor folks is doin'?
Without.
Yeah.
What's up, Brad?
Look over on that hill.
Well, can't say I didn't give 'em fair warnin'.
Better get your guns out
'cause they're gonna shoot you whether you got 'em out or not.
I ain't gonna get you killed. Yaaah!
The old man can go straight to hell.
This just don't make no sense to me, John.
Keepin' on like this.
We don't even know if we're headin' the right direction.
I'm leavin' you at the next town, little brother.
What's the next town?
Oh, god, I don't know.
It's probably Benson.
I don't know.
Benson.
Hey, you. You asleep?
dah dum, dah hmm hmm
dah, hmm hmm
dah Dee Dee
Hey, Ross, you busy?
What's up?
Uh, well, nothin' right now.
I'm gonna go play some poker.
Wanna play?
I think I'll just stay right here.
Good luck.
See ya in the mornin...
See ya in the mornin...
Well, I'm gonna play some cards first.
Howdy.
I see an extra chair.
Can I sitin?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
All right.
I can open.
I'll see your 5 and raise you 5.
Cerveza.
All right, boys.
Takes Jacks or better.
All right, young man.
$20. Ahem.
Hmm. All right. I'll see that.
Your 20...
And I'll raise you 20.
I call.
You call?
No.
I'm raisin' you.
Looks like the boy's got somethin...
Well, let him get it said then.
40 more.
Well, now you know somethin'?
I believe him so I'm just gonna fold
'cause I ain't got doodly-shit.
60 to me, huh?
Ruff?
Call.
Pat.
Uh, 2.
- Dealer: In?
Ok, dealer takes 3.
So, what're you gonna do?
I'm gonna bet 100.
I'll see ya.
What're you doin', Ruff?
There's your 100...
And 100 better.
Dealer: Beats me.
And 200 more.
I'm out.
Ain't got that much.
How much you got?
You fellers know each other?
That's a bet.
You called.
Man: Lay 'em down.
Full barn.
7s, full of Jacks.
You cheated me!
Don't shoot me.
Jesus Christ.
Frank!
No, I ain't got nothin...
Now the next son of a bitch that moves...
Dealer: I don't think the bartender was gonna shoot ya.
Why the fuck didn't he put out a sign?!
Some kinda poker game.
How bad you hurt?
I'm ok. I'm bleedin...
Take this. I'll be back.
You want me to get ya adoctor?
No, I don't need no doctor.
You could pick up my winnin's.
I think you'll find that it's correct.
You sure you don't want me to get the doctor?
Thank you.
Good luck.
God...
Damn.
I should've stuck with what I was doin...
Frank: What are you doin'?
I'm gonna give her $100.
Now you take good care, darlin'.
You'll pay for that.
I'm bleedin' to death, and you're givin' away our money.
Come on, come on. Yah! Come on.
I'd like to talk to the sheriff.
Go right ahead.
My name's Paul Buckman.
Me and my brother here come in from Montana.
Yeah, I know who you are.
How you know?
Ah, sheriff Jackson sent word.
Y'all get on down and come in the office.
I wanna talk to ya.
Ok.
Man: Let not your hearts be troubled.
If ye believe in god, believe also in me.
In my father's house there are many mansions.
If it were not so,
I would have told you.
If I go to prepare a place for you,
I will come again and receive you unto myself...
Paul: We better get on back, little brother.
John: No.
He told us to do something, we better do it.
Mama's gonna be needing us.
The last thing pa said was bring Frank Post and Ross Bodine back.
I aim to do it if it takes me the rest of my life.
He was a man by the name of yost.
Ruff Yost.
He's a no-good son of a bitch.
He drew down on Post, and I guess when he did, all hell busted loose,
'cause when it was all over there was 3 men and a woman dead.
That sounds like self-defense to me.
Yeah, but a reliable witness, he, uh, he don't think Bodine oughta got that bartender 'cause, uh...
Then there's that little matter of bank robbin', you know.
Paul: Johnny!
Johnny.
Go home.
Ain't got to prove nothin' no more, John.
This ain't up to us.
They was r-bar men, they stole r-bar money.
Aw, hell, John.
They stole circle-c money and lazy-w money and they stole half the money in town.
You're talking about r-bar money, he said it'd be a cold day in hell before anyone tries again.
But he don't mean nothin' now, John.
He's dead, John-boy.
No, he ain't, Paul.
We're the ranch now, you and me.
You understand that?
How you doin'? You wanna stop?
No. Not much longer till dark.
Ross: Have another drink.
Now, Frank, relax,
'cause I don't want you jerking while I'm gettin' this thing out.
Ain't there a better way to do this?
I wish there were, partner.
Oh, come on!
God damn it, I haven't even started!
Have another drink.
Come on!
Come on, drink it all, god damn it.
I don't wanna have to hit you in the head.
Oh, god damn.
Hold on.
Oh, god, Ross! God damn, Ross!
God... de... ro... ohh! God, Ross!
God damn it, lie down!
Aah!
Damn it, come out of there, you son of a bitch!
Uhh.
Ohh!
Sure wish I felt like things were gonna be...
Just dandy.
They crossed here, I'd say, sometime this morning.
Well, that's the Utah line.
You... y'all gonna go ahead?
So long, sheriff. Ahem.
Listen, son, why don't you turn around and come go back with us, and maybe he'll give it up after a while?
Nah. He'll... he'll either bring 'em back, or he'll die trying.
I don't care much for him lately, but I think I'd rather see him bring 'em back.
Hoo, John!
Thanks, sheriff.
Come on, boys. Let's go home.
Paul: Little brother!
I know it ain't too appetizing, but you oughta try to eat something.
It ain't that I don't admire your cooking, Ross, but tonight I think I'm just gonna have too pass.
How 'bout a drink?
I couldn't handle that, either.
Christ, you're sick.
Probably dying. Heh.
You're burnin' up.
I'm so cold, I can't stop shakin...
Let's take another look at that leg.
It's not so good, huh?
No, it ain't so bad.
Hell it ain't.
If it hurts worse, you can cut it off and I'll kiss you for doin' it.
Ok, it's infected.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
Yeah, there's one right over the next hill. Heh.
And he's got
2 beautiful daughters.
Hey, wouldn't that just be...
That'd be just as good as you could get, huh?
We'd better be headin' back for Benson.
What happens if we keep goin'?
Well, this is awful big territory.
Not many people around.
Bound to run into somebody sooner or later, but I wouldn't guarantee it wasn't later than sooner.
Well, we made it this far.
I guess I can make it the rest of the way.
It's too big a gamble, Frank.
It's my gamble.
It's my gamble, and I'll bet you $1,000 we find us a town quicker than it would take us to get back to Benson.
Ok. I mean, I don't wanna bet you, but if you wanna do it that way, that's the way we'll do it.
Now, if you need anything, just holler, huh?
Hey, Ross.
- Yeah?
- Hey, Ross.
You wanna stop?
I don't wanna stop. I feel...
Easy, partner. Hold on.
Hold on, partner.
Aah!
Think I'll ever see Mexico?
Why, hell, yes.
After all this, it better be as good as you say.
It's better.
I just didn't want to tell you too much.
Uh, afraid you'd get too anxious.
Tell me now.
Well, uh, a lot of it you know.
Tell me again.
It's green.
Yeah. Yeah, it's green most of the year.
Uh, lots of grass, plenty of water.
We can run us
1,000 or 2,000 head if we wanted to, but, uh, that kind of spread spells work, and I figure we've done enough of that.
We'll just get us a few mex cattle just to keep our hands in.
But once we get that real fine hacienda built, plenty of people to do the work and the cleaning up, you and I are gonna take it easy.
Whoa, now.
And I tell you, some of those mexicana girls are just about as pretty as you'll ever wanna see.
Yes, sir, Frank.
I give you my personal word of honor that if there's one place in this whole world where a cowboy can kick off his spurs and be happy for the rest of his life, that's where we're going.
So hang on, partner.
It ain't much farther.
Well, I guess by now you got me figured out as someone that don't surprise too easy, for one thing, and I ain't the most superstitious bronc crasher in the world, for another.
But I tell you, Frank.
The more it goes, the more I see every day, the less I wouldn't swear that we ain't really got much to say about it.
Maybe it's all been figured out up front.
And except for a couple of measly detours, which is left to us to make it seem like we're really calling the shots, we're just doin' what was decided the day we popped into this old world.
'Cause, hell, look at us.
Now, honestly, you ever seen a more unlikely combination?
Now, who the hell would figure us throwing in together?
I remember the first day you came to work for the r-bar.
Talkin' like a windy texan, actin' like a clown, and wearing that silly-assed hard-boiled derby.
And I decided that just about everything about you wasn't my style.
And I made a calculation on you faster than I ever made one before or since, and I gave you just one week.
Just goes to show you how wrong a man can be.
Just goes to show that when it comes to something special, like lovin' a woman or judgin' a man, man just don't know shit.
A week later, we was walkin' around each other.
A month later, we was swappin' lies.
And a year later, we was robbin' us a bank.
I guess I started out hating your healthy young guts...
'Cause it was mostly all behind for me and mostly all ahead for you.
Anyway, for what it's worth...
You turned out to be one goddamn fine cowboy.
Be seein' you, partner.
all you wild rovers
you listen to me
wanna tell you the tale
of my sad history
I'm a cowboy of fortune
a lover of life
too old for a sweetheart
too young for a wife
I've drunk me some whiskey
and roped me a steer
I've busted wild broncos
my clothes, they are ragged
my language is tough
but a sweet-lovin' woman
can smooth out the rough
oh, I've tasted it all
and I'm tellin' you, men
if I had me the chance jj»
I'd sure do it again
but the days are much shorter
and winter is nigh
sooner or later
a man's gonna die
so drink to the rovers
the last of their kind
they're wild and they're woolly
and out of their minds
just a few more tomorrows
they won't be around
forgotten by all
6 feet in the ground
Yah! Come on!
You son of a...
Bodine, I'm sorry.
Me, too.
He was mine, you son of a bitch.
He was mine, Paul.
Help me take him back, Paul.
John: I've gotta...
Gotta take him back!
You gotta help me, Paul.
Gotta help me take him back, Paul.
Stand up...
Stand up, you son of a bitch.
All right. All right?
I got him, pa.
Look what I got!
Look what I got.
I done what you told me, pa.
Pa?
Paul...
Paul!
Get Ross Bodine...
Gotta take him...
Take him back...
I gotta see...
Uhh.
I did what you want.
Paul... help me.
Uhh...
Paul...
Frank: Beautiful! That's it, stay on her, Ross.
Boy, I bet you didn't have this much trouble when you was 8.
Stay on her, Ross. Stay on her!
Hold onto her! That's it!
Ride her, now, ride her!
Waltz with the lady.
Waltz with her. Whoo!
You're doin' it!
You're doin' it!
Hang onto her, now!
Hold her, Ross!
Hold her! Ride her!
Waltz with the lady. Whoo!

{9577}{9657}I could use some shavin' soap|and straight razor,
{9659}{9717}To kinda get out|from underneath this.
{9719}{9776}Can he use dad's razor, mama?
{9811}{9943}Well, not if your man feels|strongly about it. Some do.
{9975}{10029}My husband passed away|two years ago.
{10030}{10086}Oh, i'm sorry to hear that, ma'am.
{10088}{10142}You know where|your father's things are.
{10237}{10296}I'm henrietta Macavoy.
{10297}{10354}I'm pleased|to meet you, ma'am.
{10356}{10413}You're lucky to survive,|you know.
{10414}{10507}Well, you can't drown if you|was meant for something worse.
{10509}{10590}It's just a figure of speech.
{10592}{10671}Just that, me and the sea,|we don't get along together.
{10673}{10742}Oh, then you did|come off a ship?
{10772}{10837}Come off? Yes ma'am,|i think that's right.
{10838}{10885}I just wish i'd never got on it.
{10886}{10976}You're not a deserter?
{11014}{11115}As the lord as my witness,|ma'am, i am a wronged man.
{11116}{11180}That may be, mr.--
{11182}{11256}Ah, Costain.|Lincoln Costain.
{11257}{11304}My friends call me linc.
{11306}{11380}Mr. Costain,
{11381}{11427}I suggest as soon|as you're well enough,
{11428}{11480}You get yourself back to your ship.
{11481}{11564}Get back?|I was shanghaied, ma'am.
{11634}{11696}Morning, boss.|You're looking handsome already.
{11697}{11779}Liliha make you some good soup.|Fix your body up proper.
{11780}{11836}Just what might|that be, ma'am?
{11837}{11909}Make this from raw fish, some|lizard powder and dried squid.
{11911}{11960}She said it would|put hair on my chest,
{11961}{12024}But all it did was make me gag|'til my eyes watered.
{12025}{12089}Booton, behave yourself.
{12123}{12173}If it's all the same|to you, miss lili--
{12175}{12260}Liliha. You take some.|Go ahead.
{12349}{12464}- You like, no?|- No, that's pretty bad,|that is.
{12466}{12546}Actually, i'm not very hungry. If i could|just have my pants so i could get up.
{12548}{12622}Your pants were so badly torn,|we had to mend them.
{12624}{12709}Mom, they're in the garden|again, tearing up everything!
{12764}{12834}What is it?|What is it, boy?|What's the matter?
{12836}{12927}It's one of the animals. A big one.|He's eating up the vegetables again.
{13038}{13084}Get out of here!
{13086}{13142}Get out of my garden, you hear me!
{13144}{13190}You get out!|Get!
{13191}{13239}One of the animals?|Well, i'll be dogged.
{13240}{13292}You didn't tell me you had|cattle around here, button.
{13294}{13362}- Liliha!|- Booton!
{13363}{13423}We don't, that thing's wild. But|i sure hope he eats the turnips.
{13424}{13504}Well, he may be wild,|but he ain't no thing.
{13506}{13583}That's about a thousand|pounds of prime bull out there.
{13584}{13667}You stubborn,|willful, worthless,
{13668}{13741}Misbegotten beast!
{13743}{13798}That's a right nice|vocabulary, miss Macavoy,
{13799}{13855}But you'll never|talk him out of there.
{14214}{14272}Look at it.|Just look at it.
{14494}{14574}- Is this soup?|- Soup!
{14753}{14829}- Oh, hi, Costain.|- Howdy, barton.
{14831}{14886}Booton!
{14888}{14971}Look what i got for you.
{14973}{15087}That's right nice of you, son, but i'm|not real hungry just now. I just ate.
{15089}{15176}No, it ain't to eat. It's a|real hawaiian hat. For you.
{15179}{15226}Do you like it?
{15227}{15325}Like it?|Yeah, yeah, it's, uh--
{15326}{15374}It's real colorful, ain't it?
{15375}{15434}Make you look|real pretty, boss.
{15436}{15492}Put it on. It'll be great.
{15494}{15574}Well, it's just|a little more decorated|than what i had in mind.
{15575}{15665}That's all right. Make you|look real hawaiian style.
{15791}{15873}That really is quite|becoming, you know.
{15874}{15934}It's time to go into town, Booton.
{15935}{15983}I don't think i'll|go in today, mom.
{15985}{16039}I've got some things i've been|planning to do around here.
{16094}{16210}Well, all right. You be sure and|make yourself useful while i'm gone.
{16211}{16266}I'll be back by supper.
{16303}{16357}Ma'am.
{16358}{16444}Ma'am, you won't forget to ask|about a ship for me, will you?
{16446}{16559}I'll check the ships in port for a|work passage situation, mr. Costain.
{16561}{16610}Thank you, ma'am.
{16611}{16694}And if i had a good-Bye kiss,
{16695}{16793}I just might bring home|some rock candy too.
{16794}{16840}Bye, mom.|Have a good trip.
{16842}{16902}You behave yourself.|Come on, tuck.
{16904}{16954}Come on, come on.
{17219}{17269}Hey, son.
{17343}{17421}- What's the matter?|- She's probably gonna see that Bryson.
{17422}{17471}Who's that Bryson?
{17473}{17535}He's some old man who keeps|pestering her to marry him.
{17537}{17599}Oh.|I sure hope she don't.
{17601}{17686}- Why is that?|- Well, he wears perfume|for one thing.
{17688}{17761}He's always patting me on the|head and calling me "my boy."
{17762}{17877}That's what he always says.|"Well, my boy, you're|sprouting up like a weed."
{17879}{17934}He probably thinks|that's a compliment.
{17936}{18000}Well, it's not.
{18001}{18057}I'll say this for him though.|He's got good rock candy.
{18059}{18132}Oh, well, that's|a good quality to have.
{18133}{18183}A lot of men|don't have that.
{18185}{18265}Say, how 'bout you showing me|around the spread?
{18266}{18337}Well, sure. I'll show you|where i fished you out first.
{18338}{18409}Down by the cliffs|there's some caves and things.
{18474}{18525}All right, hold it up.|Can't see it all|in five minutes.
{18677}{18769}I do wish you would begin to take me|a little more seriously, henrietta.
{18771}{18827}I do, Cal.|You know i do.
{18864}{18921}You know what a disastrous|year last year was.
{18923}{18992}And crop prices don't|look any better this year.
{18994}{19048}- Then with the increased|burden of taxes--|- Oh, we'll muddle through.
{19049}{19123}- We always have, haven't we?|- Yes, but that's the point.
{19125}{19188}There's no reason for a woman|like you to have to struggle so...
{19190}{19236}Just to eke out|a meager existence.
{19238}{19284}Why don't you put|the place up for sale?
{19286}{19332}But i don't want to sell the farm.
{19334}{19385}You know how much it means to me.
{19387}{19456}Yes, i do.
{19458}{19545}My company is going to do|great things in the islands.
{19547}{19593}And as my wife,|you could--
{19595}{19642}I could have anything|my heart desires.
{19644}{19691}And i know you mean that, Cal.
{19692}{19752}But don't you see.|It just isn't possible.
{19754}{19809}Even if--
{19811}{19852}With the amount of money i owe you,
{19854}{19980}It is not proper for us to talk about|anything but a business relationship.
{19982}{20053}Money means nothing.|You know that.
{20055}{20136}- It means nothing at all.|- It does to me.
{20138}{20223}- Henrietta, i wish--|- Please.
{20306}{20348}That isn't going to change.
{20350}{20438}If ever i can do anything,|you just let me know.
{20440}{20497}Of course.
{20627}{20680}Good-Bye.
{21015}{21091}- And who are they?|- Those are the workers.
{21092}{21143}- The workers?|- Yep.
{21145}{21205}What do they do|when they're not working?
{21207}{21267}Well, there's lots of work.|We own 10,000 acres.
{21269}{21325}Biggest potato farm|on the islands.
{21327}{21388}Ten-Thousand acres of potatoes?
{21390}{21491}Most of it's open country.|Potatoes haven't been|doing too well.
{21690}{21755}Ten-Thousand acres, huh?
{21795}{21906}That's a good-Sized pea|patch, even where i come from.
{21907}{21975}- Where's that?|- Texas.
{21977}{22117}There you can ride for a month in|any direction and never touch a fence.
{22119}{22183}- Must be beautiful.|- Oh, it is.
{22184}{22262}Costain, do you think you|could ever like it here?
{22263}{22311}Me? No, no.
{22312}{22381}No, this fruit bowl|ain't for me.
{22383}{22440}Some people might like|it just fine, though.
{22442}{22496}I suppose you're going|back to texas, huh?
{22498}{22549}You bet.
{22605}{22692}- You got a wife there?|- Haven't met the woman|that could afford me.
{22694}{22764}- Then you never|did have one.|- Nope.
{22766}{22857}I had small pox once though.|Amounts to about the same thing.
{22859}{22906}Yeah.
{22908}{22970}I guess you'd never|want to settle down|and live with someone,
{22972}{23058}- No matter how nice she was, huh?|- You got that right.
{23108}{23157}But you can't have kids|if you ain't married.
{23158}{23221}Yeah, ain't that a mercy?
{23268}{23317}What are you going to|do when you get old?
{23318}{23374}Die, i guess.
{23375}{23461}No, i mean before that. Who'll take|care of you if you don't have a son?
{23462}{23525}I'll say one thing|for you.
{23526}{23578}You get a notion, you|sure hang on to it, burton.
{23579}{23629}Booton!
{23630}{23683}Oh, yeah.
{23685}{23747}- What's that?|- Come on!
{23932}{23983}What's going on?
{24403}{24465}- Untranslated subtitle -
{25022}{25079}Oh, no.|Those cattle again.
{25289}{25363}Go on! Get out!
{25921}{26001}Out of the way!|Hey!
{26003}{26070}Hey! Hey!
{26159}{26210}Costain!
{26235}{26303}Hey!
{26305}{26367}Out of the way!|Out of the way!
{26369}{26448}Costain, come on!
{26810}{26876}Hija! Hija!|Hija!
{27080}{27142}Hija! Hija! Move!
{27497}{27565}Costain! Costain!
{27698}{27792}Turn around, son!|Face him!
{27793}{27877}Don't move! Freeze!
{28596}{28659}All right, boy.|Run for the house.
{28853}{28905}Ya! Get out of here!
{29027}{29093}You should've seen|that critter, mama.|I was really scared.
{29095}{29168}And then he kept twisting that|bull's head 'til it fell over.
{29170}{29226}And then he let it go,|and it ran off.
{29227}{29298}That must've been|quite a sight.
{29299}{29395}So, you know how to tame them?
{29396}{29461}It's not a matter|of taming them, ma'am,
{29463}{29511}It's just a matter|of handling 'em.
{29512}{29611}You could sure handle 'em. Just like you|handled that bull. Pow! Right, Costain?
{29613}{29688}Booton!|Mr. Costain.
{29690}{29787}Mr. Costain, you could probably make those|old cattle do whatever you took a mind to.
{29788}{29867}I don't know about that.|It doesn't make much difference.
{29868}{29969}No point in talkin' about it.|You're in the potato business.
{29971}{30075}Were in the potato business.|Prices have dropped off|terribly.
{30111}{30190}Well, it seem to me|like you're...
{30191}{30272}Struggling|your way past a dollar,|just to grub after a dime.
{30274}{30377}You can get $20 a head for|them cattle in california.
{30458}{30530}But what you do|is your business.
{30531}{30603}Me? I'm on my way|to texas.
{30604}{30660}As a matter of fact, mrs. Macavoy,
{30662}{30738}Did you find anything in the way of|a ship for me when you were in town?
{30739}{30817}Oh, no. I think it's|the wrong time of year.
{30819}{30893}- But mama--|- For ships.
{30913}{30959}- I mean--|- Well, i'll just|have to make do.
{30961}{31010}I won't be imposin'|on you folks.
{31012}{31085}I'll head into town|tomorrow and wait.
{31086}{31162}As long as you're going to wait,|you might as well wait here.
{31163}{31218}Beg pardon, ma'am.
{31220}{31330}And work-- Help out.|I could pay you.
{31331}{31376}A little, not much.
{31378}{31453}Room and board too.|Right, mama?
{31454}{31566}- I don't know.|- Just for a while.
{31567}{31682}Until you earn so money. You'll|need some money, mr. Costain.
{31684}{31760}And, who knows?
{31762}{31852}With your help, we might|turn this sorry potato farm...
{31854}{31973}Into the first and only|wild cattle ranch in hawaii.
{32030}{32080}You, uh--
{32082}{32146}You sure you're not|from texas, ms. Macavoy?
{32147}{32194}You will stay,|won't you?
{32195}{32284}Won't you, Costain?
{32286}{32360}Well, i'll hit her a lick|and see what happens.
{32362}{32421}But that's all i'll promise.
{32581}{32655}- Aloha.|- Aloha, miss maka.
{32657}{32709}I want to talk to you this morning...
{32710}{32835}About some changes that are going|to be made on the farm today.
{32837}{32933}Mr. Costain is a|cattleman from texas.
{32971}{33052}And he knows how to handle the|animals as you all saw yesterday.
{33054}{33100}Yeah.
{33101}{33222}We have not been doing|well with our potatoes.
{33263}{33384}Mr. Costain feel we|would do better...
{33385}{33485}- If we caught the animals and sold them.|- Caught the animals?
{33486}{33550}Oh, no, wait!|Wait, wait!
{33552}{33652}You mustn't be frightened.|Mr. Costain assures me...
{33653}{33793}That the animals can be handled,|and he is going to teach us how.
{33794}{33866}Aren't you, mr. Costain?
{34172}{34226}All right, now.|This here animal is a horse.
{34228}{34342}Now you're all gonna have one of these|to chase them brush doggies out there.
{34373}{34421}Brush doggies.|That's cattle.
{34423}{34475}You need one of these|to keep up with cattle.
{34477}{34537}There's only two things you|gotta know about a horse:
{34539}{34616}How to get on and how to stay on.
{34617}{34712}This is your saddle, where|you're gonna sit when you ride.
{34713}{34786}You just sit in there like|a rocking chair, you savvy?
{34788}{34857}Just walk up here and put|your foot in the stirrup.
{34859}{34936}That's the stirrup. That's|right there. See it?
{34938}{35006}Put your foot in the stirrup|and swing right up. See?
{35016}{35077}To! Bravo majstore!|Svaka èast!
{35136}{35202}Good. Now who's going|to be the first to try it?
{35273}{35385}Well, there's one thing you can't|learn to do, is ride without getting on.
{35387}{35445}- Now come on!|- Go, go, go!
{35447}{35495}Come on.
{35496}{35568}All right, now.|You all watch him.
{35720}{35771}To! Bravo majstore!
{35801}{35857}Turn around.|Go on, turn around.
{36496}{36554}Now you try it.
{36972}{37051}Yes, it's true.|They do like their fun.
{37053}{37117}Like it? They'd rather|giggle than laugh.
{37119}{37205}They'd rather laugh than eat.|They're like a bunch|of kids out there.
{37207}{37261}A school girl'd be more sober, ma'am.
{37263}{37308}Well now, after they|get to know you better,
{37310}{37359}And understand what you're|trying to teach them--
{37360}{37423}Oh, and another thing.|You say you can't buy|any horses.
{37425}{37477}Now, how do you expect|me to work cattle...
{37479}{37549}With one|old wall-Eyed refugee|from a glue factory?
{37551}{37605}- Well, maybe--|- If you could get 'em,
{37607}{37669}You don't have any bridles,|saddles, blankets.
{37671}{37751}You don't have|any spurs, boots.
{37753}{37831}Ma'am, they don't even have|anything decent to wear.
{37832}{37935}Well, if we need horses...
{37975}{38026}Perhaps i can get some.
{38027}{38099}I-I don't know how.
{38144}{38178}Yes, i do.
{38179}{38269}I can get horses,|and i will.
{38271}{38340}And their clothes may not suit you,
{38342}{38398}But they find them very comfortable.
{38399}{38471}Yes, ma'am, comfortable.|I think that's the right|word for it.
{38472}{38562}Besides, anything they need,|they can make here.
{38563}{38678}There isn't|a single thing needed|that we can't make right here.
{38680}{38729}Except for a--
{38731}{38822}A little determination|and leadership...
{38823}{38886}From a man|who has the know-How.
{38887}{38968}And that is a fact, mr. Costain.
{39016}{39099}When are you going to stop|calling me mr. Costain, ma'am?
{39172}{39275}When you stop calling me|ma'am, mr. Costain.
{39614}{39680}It's just a formality, henrietta.
{39682}{39730}I don't think you should|even bother to sign it.
{39731}{39816}I will not take another loan from|you without giving proper security.
{39818}{39886}This is a mortgage for|all of your property.
{39887}{39942}It's disproportionate,|it's not necessary.
{39943}{40047}Cal, i owe you a great deal.|Now i need more money.
{40105}{40126}And this is the only|way i'll take it.
{40127}{40179}Business is business.
{40181}{40263}- Even between us?|- Especially between us.
{40294}{40350}All right.
{40352}{40426}- Thank you very much. And good night, Cal.|- Good night, henrietta.
{40871}{40923}Another favor|for the lady?
{40925}{40987}As a matter of fact,|yes.
{40989}{41095}Whenever she needs money,|she can always ask you.
{41097}{41145}And i give.
{41146}{41214}And now, the mortgage.
{41246}{41326}Maybe if she owe you more|than she can pay back--
{41362}{41486}You could say that mrs. Macavoy|and i finally are partners.
{41767}{41805}Hooey-Hooey!
{41947}{41987}All right, that's enough,|that's enough.
{41989}{42045}You can get off.
{42077}{42125}Ahhh!
{42334}{42398}All right now, who's next?
{42483}{42583}Malakoma, mr. Costain|is working under my orders.
{42629}{42702}- Do you hear me?|- What is it? What does he want?
{42704}{42772}- He doesn't like you at all.|- He's challenging you.
{42773}{42843}Yeah, he thinks he's|something special around here.
{42909}{43001}All right, partner,|you're something special.
{43031}{43123}Come on, leleo.
{43124}{43160}Come on.
{43162}{43246}Malakoma!
{43335}{43471}If he's looking to get a rise|out of me, he just did it.
{43527}{43608}No, you mustn't!|He'll kill you!
{45445}{45527}Well, you won that one,|all right. Here.
{45529}{45654}Here, let me show you how|we do it where i come from.
{45655}{45771}Now, you get off this|land and don't come back.
{46400}{46451}Come on, leleo, get up there.
{46591}{46669}Come on, leleo.
{46742}{46797}Come on, leleo,|get up there.
{47008}{47091}They're coming, they're coming!
{47093}{47151}Mom, come see! They're here!
{47153}{47217}Come on, they're here!
{48203}{48258}Move! Move, you!
{48260}{48309}Move, move!
{48338}{48385}Ah, thanks, boss.
{48386}{48464}First, the blanket, then the saddle.
{49182}{49229}Where are you going, batton?
{49230}{49287}Booton!
{49289}{49377}Ah, shucks. What's the use?|I can't get the dang thing|to work anyhow.
{49379}{49493}In my outfit, we only quit when|it's too dark to work or time to eat.
{49495}{49553}I didn't hear the|dinner bell, did you?
{49797}{49881}Now, you put the stirrup|up over the horn like this.
{49950}{50005}Ugh!
{50061}{50111}Now, go to work.
{50253}{50300}Put the reins together.|Hold them in one hand.
{50301}{50350}That's it. Get, go on.
{50352}{50440}Would you keep in a circle?|Keep in a circle!
{50441}{50499}Slow down, slow down!
{50501}{50584}Keep your feet in there.
{50586}{50684}Benton, not up and down. Sit|there like a rocking chair.
{50686}{50735}Booton!
{51111}{51176}You wrap it around|and you get it tight.
{51177}{51221}Got that?
{51268}{51329}All right, kimo. It's your turn.
{51331}{51381}Get him, kimo.
{51383}{51430}Yeah, go get him.
{51831}{51933}But they are learning,|actually learning. It's amazing.
{51935}{51996}You're making yourself the|laughing stock of the island.
{51997}{52118}One of the captains was saying they're|even talking about it in lahaina.
{52213}{52260}Good luck.
{52262}{52308}Ya.
{52505}{52575}Ready, boss!
{52576}{52611}Go to it.
{53293}{53375}- What do we do now, boss?|- We could try some card tricks.
{53376}{53458}We fine, boss.|We've not had enough yet.
{53503}{53556}Well, i have.
{53634}{53695}Mr. Costain?
{53803}{53857}Mr. Costain?
{53937}{54007}I'd like you to meet|a friend of mine.|Mr. Bryson, mr. Costain.
{54009}{54060}- Mr. Bryson.|- Mr. Costain.
{54062}{54123}So that's they way you plan|to catch wild cattle?
{54125}{54194}Not exactly, no.
{54195}{54241}Ms. Macavoy, tells me you're new|on the island. Where are you from?
{54243}{54306}- Texas.|- Texas? How did you happen|to come to kauai?
{54307}{54404}I was unhappy|with my last employer.
{54406}{54453}Who was that?
{54455}{54563}Mr. Bryson tells me it's impossible to|load cattle onto boats in these waters.
{54565}{54641}It was tried once|on the big island.
{54643}{54735}Two ships ran on the reefs,|and there is no anchorage|further out.
{54737}{54800}Well, don't they have docks in hilea?
{54802}{54860}Never needed them.
{54862}{54922}Well, how do|they load then?
{54923}{54998}Mostly by long boat.
{55000}{55094}Can you imagine trying to|load cattle by long boat?
{55096}{55194}Well, there's gotta be a way.|Just a matter of findin' it.
{55195}{55268}Mr. Costain says there ain't never|been a horse that ain't been rode,
{55270}{55374}- And ain't never been a rider that ain't been thrown.|- Is that what he says?
{55375}{55478}I won't challenge the statement,|but i will the grammar.
{55480}{55563}Grammar never was my strong suit.
{55565}{55638}Young man, you are sprouting up|like a weed.
{55694}{55733}At least he's got|good rock candy?
{55734}{55811}- I beg your pardon.|- Excuse me.
{56236}{56302}Good morning, boss.
{56350}{56401}Where are they?
{56434}{56490}Oh, boys no tell me, boss.
{56492}{56552}Maybe they go work|someplace else, yes?
{56554}{56683}Yeah, maybe it'll snow|this afternoon too.
{56685}{56742}But i doubt it.
{57949}{58039}Yah! Whee!|Whoo-Hooey!
{58136}{58191}Yee-Haw! Whoo!
{58364}{58420}Let's get out of here!
{58743}{58808}What do you think|you're doing down there?
{58809}{58869}Costain!
{58922}{58969}Whoo-Hoo!
{58971}{59054}Costain!|Look out, Costain!
{59056}{59119}Aaah! Aye!
{59399}{59468}Are you all right, Costain?
{59469}{59557}Fine!
{59559}{59610}Just fine.
{59729}{59821}You just can't expect to change|a whole culture overnight.
{59823}{59897}I don't have|a least notion of changing it.
{59899}{59996}If you just give me my wages,|i won't be troubling you|any further.
{59998}{60064}You know, this is sunday.
{60065}{60128}They're entitled to some recreation.
{60129}{60257}Well, there just ain't any sundays when|it's roundup 'til the job gets done.
{60259}{60335}Well, perhaps if you met them|half way, they would be able--
{60336}{60422}Ma'am, there aren't any "half|ways" in the cattle business
{60424}{60520}It'd be easier to make|a cherry pie out of barbed wire,
{60522}{60578}Than to make a cowboy out|of the best of the lot of 'em.
{60579}{60627}They just ain't cut out for workin'.
{60628}{60663}Booton says they're really trying.
{60665}{60723}That's what's frightening.|They are.
{60725}{60798}- Well, if they're|showing progress--|- They're not showing progress.
{60799}{60859}They're just trying.|It ain't the same thing.
{60861}{60970}Ma'am, suppose i could|whip them into shape.
{60971}{61043}It's not possible,|but just suppose i did.
{61044}{61118}Running cattle is--
{61119}{61187}Well, it's not just|riding and roping,
{61189}{61236}It takes, it takes purpose.
{61238}{61356}And you can't teach that to someone|like you can teach 'em to sit a horse.
{61451}{61545}I figure you owe me $17,|but whatever you think's right.
{61676}{61772}Mr. Costain,
{61774}{61855}I could raise|your salary.
{61887}{61934}It's not the money, ma'am.
{61935}{62008}I think i ought to get back to|texas before i lose all my stitching.
{62010}{62109}I have nightmares about these|people you wouldn't believe.
{62111}{62182}Well, this won't get|you back to texas.
{62183}{62251}Well,|it'll get me started.
{62339}{62399}Couldn't you at least|wait until morning?
{62400}{62460}I mean--
{62462}{62523}I don't know, ma'am.|I don't think so.
{62525}{62645}If i wait around 'til morning,|it'll just make things tougher|than they ought to be.
{62858}{62907}Mrs. Macavoy,
{62998}{63092}There ain't nothin'|personal in all this.
{63094}{63154}You people have been|mighty kind to me.
{63330}{63381}Bye, ma'am.
{63562}{63611}Costain!
{63661}{63718}Costain!
{63819}{63886}Mama, mama!
{63960}{64022}Mama.|Where is he, mama?
{64023}{64076}He's gone, son.
{64078}{64169}- Gone? You mean forever?|- I'm afraid so.
{64170}{64258}But how could you do it?|How could you just let him|go like that?
{64260}{64341}I just didn't let him go.|He's a man, he does|what he wants to.
{64342}{64404}- I couldn't stop him.|- Well, you could've tried.
{64406}{64452}You could've got me up.|I would've made him stay.
{64454}{64543}Booton, please.
{64765}{64835}I bet $20.
{64936}{65027}Twenty and raise twenty.
{65105}{65170}That puts me out. I don't|have anything to bet with.
{65202}{65270}Oh, i wouldn't say that.
{65547}{65643}Five-Card stud, gentlemen.
{66021}{66087}What's he doing here?
{66089}{66161}Taking money away from fools.
{66226}{66297}He's been winning|all night.
{66461}{66553}I see you've found an|easier way to make a living.
{66555}{66618}There's an empty chair|if you feel like sitting in.
{67281}{67331}Ace bets.
{67332}{67413}Don't talk unless|you're in the game.
{67593}{67624}Bet 20.
{68127}{68238}I hope you gentlemen will forgive|me, but i've got a ship to catch.
{68240}{68346}- You leaving the islands?|- Well, thanks to these|gentlemen gamblers.
{68348}{68457}Captain, if you ever dock in fort worth, you|look me up. Give you a chance to get even.
{69051}{69130}You stay.|We be cowboy for you, boss.
{69131}{69196}No swim, no fish,|not even sunday.
{69198}{69283}- We work hard, boss.|- No water slide.|Not any kind of play.
{69285}{69357}They mean it, Costain.|Really.
{69413}{69489}We got clothes good for catch cows.
{69491}{69559}- Our pants no good, boss?|- You stay, boss.
{69561}{69642}- Come on, Costain!|- Please, stay, boss.
{69643}{69746}- Who belongs to this boat?|- Me, mister.
{69747}{69842}Could you row me out|to that ship out there?
{69843}{69915}It's a long row.
{69985}{70065}- Come on, boss!|- Please stay, Costain!
{70067}{70136}- Stay!|- Come on, Costain!
{70195}{70274}Come on, Costain.|Don't go!
{70276}{70357}Come on, Costain.|We promise to work!
{70986}{71089}Costain, i didn't hear the|dinner bell ring, did you?
{71222}{71291}Turn around,|row for shore.
{71823}{71898}And he bought boots for all of them?
{71900}{71978}Yep, with his poker money. He said we just|had to have them if we're gonna run cattle.
{71979}{72025}Look there.
{72162}{72218}Mighty good, boss.
{73168}{73220}Ya-Hoo!
{74181}{74227}- We finished now, boss.|- Good, huh?
{74229}{74275}Yeah, boss.
{74276}{74356}Well, all we gotta do now|is fill it up.
{74544}{74622}That's a great deal|of money, Malakoma.
{74624}{74660}More than you can earn in a year.
{74661}{74760}You did not|get it from me.
{74762}{74847}You didn't come here.|Do you understand?
{74905}{74963}You and Malakoma no talk.
{75002}{75049}That's it.
{75051}{75125}I don't care how you do it,
{75127}{75217}But i don't want those|cattle rounded up for sale.
{75363}{75431}Costain, Costain!
{75644}{75679}Yeah, what is it lily?
{75682}{75741}- Untranslated subtitle -
{75744}{75800}- What?|- Animal in field, boss!
{75802}{75868}Oh, yeah?
{75869}{75925}All right, let's just|see what you've learned?
{75927}{75981}Let's go.
{76301}{76359}Kimo, cut your teeth.
{76436}{76525}Kimo, shake that loop out|and go to it.
{78063}{78146}Kimo, what's wrong?|What happened?
{79388}{79486}How does he know he's dying if he|doesn't even know what's wrong with him?
{79487}{79579}They call it|death by sorcery.
{79613}{79709}- Witch doctor.|- Malakoma is one of them.
{79710}{79789}I don't believe in it, but they|believe in it, and that's what matters.
{79790}{79844}That's why they won't work for you.
{79901}{79946}But why kimo?|It's me he's after.
{79947}{80036}I don't know. I suppose he feels|that's the way to get to you.
{80749}{80817}Liliha, what's the matter|with you, woman?
{80818}{80874}Liliha, Liliha!
{80876}{80945}Liliha, it's Costain.|Now stop it.
{80947}{81025}Malakoma get you, Costain, for sure.
{81026}{81073}You leave here or you die.
{81075}{81145}You just tell me|where he is.
{81147}{81280}Malakoma say two more days,|kimo die, then leleo.
{81281}{81317}I'm not leaving.
{81319}{81391}So if we're gonna|die, we're gonna die.
{81393}{81503}The only chance we have is if|you tell me where Malakoma is.
{81551}{81608}Now tell me, Liliha.
{81674}{81733}Him go taboo ground.
{81735}{81826}Live all alone in|caverns of dead gods.
{88378}{88451}Are you lucky|i need you alive!
{89551}{89646}All right now,|loud and clear, do it.
{89648}{89732}Do whatever it is you have to do, or|you and me are gonna bump heads again.
{89733}{89801}Now, do it!
{90211}{90272}What'd he say, Liliha?
{90274}{90350}He say kimo no die now.|No more anna na.
{90854}{90907}Kimo?
{90972}{91097}- The spell is over.|- You bet it's over, for good.
{91099}{91180}No, no, kimo.|You rest.
{91182}{91248}Yes, miss maka.
{91249}{91300}Booton, you watch him.
{91483}{91594}You better go find yourself|another island, buster. Get goin'.
{91992}{92064}Well, don't stand around.|Show's over.
{92066}{92175}Come on, come on.|We got a lot of work to do.
{92238}{92304}Mr. Costain.
{92306}{92379}They'll never forget you|for what you've done.
{92380}{92435}They'll do anything|for you now.
{92488}{92583}We'll see who forgets who|when the going gets rough,|ma'am.
{92716}{92779}Just remember what|you learned and use it.
{92780}{92835}You might come out of|this day in one piece.
{92836}{92883}Mount up.
{92961}{93007}Well, miss Macavoy,
{93008}{93095}You may or may not own a bunch|of maverick cattle at sundown,
{93096}{93151}But at least you won't|have to wonder anymore.
{93152}{93204}Today's the day|that tells it all.
{93206}{93267}I know, mr. Costain.|Thank you.
{94646}{94748}They're bunched up in the brush.|That ain't good.
{94750}{94834}Don't try to rope 'em in there.|Just haze 'em out in the open,
{94835}{94892}So you can throw|a good loop at 'em.
{94894}{94966}All right,|let's cut the brush.

{95210}{95287}You're ready.|You're not that ready.

{104396}{104473}What makes you think|you can get them critters|out to the ship?
{104475}{104531}What makes you|think i can't?
{104533}{104598}Well, no one|ever has, lad.
{104600}{104681}That's beside the point. Do you|want the cattle or don't you?
{104683}{104769}Indeed i do, little lady.|As bad as you want to sell 'em.
{104771}{104879}I'll give you 15 dollars|a head, loaded on.
{104881}{104975}Sir, you're a captain,|not a pirate.
{104977}{105059}Twenty dollars a head.|Not a penny less.
{105061}{105107}Alongside.
{105196}{105281}Seventeen-Fifty, on board.|There's no profit in it for me.
{105317}{105368}Uh, a gentleman...
{105369}{105461}Is not supposed to lie|in the presence of a lady.
{105463}{105515}Twenty dollars.
{105517}{105565}Alongside.
{105750}{105852}Upon my word, lad, i wish you|had left the little lady at home.
{105974}{106030}All right, 20 it is, on--
{106032}{106079}- Alongside.|- Alongside.
{106081}{106132}- Thank you very much.|- You're not leaving so soon.
{106134}{106232}We'd love to stay, but we've got|more cattle to sell, haven't we?
{106234}{106294}Yes, indeed we have.|Good day.
{106456}{106555}It's impossible to load|cattle aboard those boats!
{106556}{106663}I would not bet|against that man.|No, not on anything.
{106784}{106856}And he can't deliver|cattle he can't find.
{106858}{106906}Can he?
{106956}{107016}- What?|- Stampede them.
{107056}{107103}Will you do it?
{107104}{107220}Sure, with some guns and a|little help, they'll go, but--
{107941}{108032}It doesn't really hurt 'em.|I mean, they're a tough breed.
{108034}{108154}It's not always true. It just|depends on where you are at the time.
{108343}{108436}You only do that with--|Yearlings...
{108438}{108527}When you know you got|a long winter comin' on.
{108528}{108599}'Course your winter here|only lasts about 20 minutes.
{108601}{108652}What's wrong, Costain?
{108830}{108919}Stampede. Stampede!|Get everybody out of these huts.
{108920}{108979}Everybody out!|Everybody out!
{109263}{109347}Liliha! Stampede. Get all the|women and children to the beach.
{109348}{109404}You men saddle your horses.|Now move! Move!
{109406}{109491}Stampede! Stampede!
{109670}{109715}Go get your mother!
{110009}{110082}Hija! Hija!
{110643}{110715}Liliha, i told you to take|them to the beach. Now go!
{110978}{111042}What can we do?
{111114}{111155}Get under there!
{111929}{111981}You take care of your mother.
{112086}{112136}Hija!
{112696}{112813}Run those leaders!|Run them!
{113049}{113124}Come back!|Stay with me!
{113278}{113365}Oka, kimo, turn 'em!|Turn 'em!
{114147}{114195}Aaah!
{114500}{114547}Marrujo!
{114592}{114668}For two bits, i'd take you|apart and feed you to the hogs,
{114669}{114723}But i need you for somethin' else.
{114724}{114772}Come on.
{115688}{115783}Where the devil|have you been?
{115784}{115847}What happened out there?
{115848}{115925}The stampede, Bryson.
{116079}{116160}It was quite a ruckus.|Should've been out there|yourself.
{116162}{116208}What are you doing here?
{116210}{116268}Gettin' ready|to have you put away.
{116270}{116366}But first there's a matter of|mrs. Macavoy's note. I want it.
{116367}{116474}Note? You can't-- That's a legal|document. She owes that money to me.
{116475}{116554}After tonight,|with the cattle she lost,
{116555}{116626}The grounds and the|buildings getting torn up,
{116627}{116713}I figure you and the lady|are about even, mister.
{116715}{116768}I want the note.
{116770}{116819}Now.
{116821}{116919}All right.|I'll get it for you.
{117994}{118042}What's goin' on?
{118144}{118196}He's all yours.
{118253}{118330}- All right on your feet.|- Come on now, let's go.
{119199}{119250}Hey, watch out now!
{119846}{119911}- Captain.|- Oh, it's good|to see you, ma'am.
{119913}{119965}And especially your merchandise.
{120053}{120137}All right, oka,|throw a loop on one...
{120138}{120199}- And move him out.|- Right away, boss.
{120965}{121030}Hey! Oh-Ho!
{121032}{121089}All right, let him go.
{122979}{123079}Keep pullin'. Steady. Tighten|down now, tighten down.
{123724}{123792}All right, take him out.
{124483}{124561}Well, barrin' tidal waves|and barbary pirates,
{124563}{124648}You're about to be|in the cattle business|all the way.
{124823}{124912}Come to think of it,|i think we could handle|a tidal wave.
{125183}{125251}- Stand by!|- Stand by!
{125343}{125391}Away the sling!
{125866}{125946}- Take him up.|- Hoist him away!
{126316}{126392}- Lower away!|- Lower away!
{126476}{126525}Easy does it, matey.
{126708}{126763}- Steady!|- Steady as she goes.
{127650}{127733}Hey, you know, i think|i sold them boys short...
{127734}{127810}When i said they couldn't|drive hot nails in a snow bank.
{127812}{127881}I think they could.|I really think they could.
{127883}{128001}- Henrietta,|what are you cryin' about?
{128003}{128113}I don't know. I guess i never|really believed it would happen.
{128114}{128200}You made a believer out|of me, Costain, missus.
{128201}{128265}Here's your money.|Coin of the realm.
{128266}{128378}A mate's pay to anyone who will|nursemaid them cows back to california.
{128447}{128528}Well, that's my chance|to get back to texas.
{128565}{128633}I don't know, captain,|that right temptin',
{128634}{128729}But i don't think i could leave mrs.|Macavoy with them pineapple cowboys.
{128730}{128827}They'd drive her dingy, and i'm the only|one around who knows how to handle 'em.
{128829}{128901}Well, suit yourself, lad,|and i don't blame you.
{128902}{128962}But i gotta get them|cows to california.
{128964}{129015}Thanks to both of you.
{129017}{129064}- Good-Bye.|- Good-Bye, now.
{129117}{129213}Then you are going to stay?|At least for a while, linc?
{129241}{129305}Well, for a while, yeah.|For a while.
{129306}{129376}You know, 'til they|get the hang of it.
{129377}{129449}Then i'm gonna get off|this flower pot.
{129450}{129515}Mama! Mama!
{129517}{129578}- Good heavens,|we're right here.|- Tarnation, mom!
{129580}{129669}I swam one of those critters|out just as smooth as butter.
{129671}{129720}- Did you see?|- Of course we did, dear.
{129721}{129779}And nobody could have done it better.
{129781}{129859}Oh, well, now,|that's a little thick,|don't you think?
{129860}{129951}Ain't nobody gonna pin a rose|on you just for doin' your job.
{129952}{129998}You remember that, Booton.
{130000}{130070}Mom, mom, he called me|by my right name!
{130072}{130148}Did you hear him?|He said it right|for the first time!
{130439}{130531}Can we do it together|this time? Can we?
{130532}{130618}Well, can't think|of any reason why not.
{130620}{130672}Throw your loop.
Why did you come back?
Why did you come back?
The world keeps going around and around,
So you'll always end up in the same place.
Then stay put.
They were never really your people.
Even though you did your part in their war,
.. and you won your medals.
Didn't you?
The only exist for mankind is to fulfill his destiny. why do you wanna change mine?
I didn't want, remember?
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy!
I changed destiny when I decided that you alone..
.. to survive that useless massacre.
Or have you forgotten?
Oh you've never been away so long.
Your memories will let you forget the deaths that have to be paid.
Aren't you tired of killing?
I have to survive!
Keoma!
Keoma!
Franco Nero in...
<b>KEOMA</b>
Don't touch me Liza!
You're still clean.
You have to save the baby,
You gotta be through with touching me.
What difference does it make?
Where they're taking us,
I'm bound to catch it, sooner or later.
Instead of dragging away the dire*, why don't we kill 'em right here?
Haven't you ever heard of
Christian charity?
When I'm trying to attract their attention, jump off and hide.
But "Mat", you can't!
-They'll only kill..
-Sh..sh..sh..
Just get ready to act... fast.
One of them is legging a break forward!
Stop him! Stop him!
No! No!
See how you like this, sweetheart!
Don't touch her!
She's got the plague.
You mind your own business, stranger!
We're taking another to the old mine,
Where the others are.
It's the best place for 'em.
Anyone who tries to run away gets shot.
That's orders.
Why if anyone of them's got back, they could infect the whole town.
I never liked people who talk too much.
Get off your horse!
I said, get off your horse!
Jane! That's isn't clean* enough.
Put some line*.
Come on, move, higher, higher...
Not like that.
Like this, like this,...
Hey, mister!
Come on over, and join the fun.
There's everything here come Wiskey you'll love it.
We can all what she's gonna do a man.
The town is a dying up flies.
Give us something to drink.
Hey..
Hey, that's Farrow's wife.
What the hell is SHE doing here?
She has got the plague.
Oh my God, gather around!
Don't touch,
She's got the plague!
Throw her out!
Before we all get it.
I told you to give us something to drink.
You get that woman, out of here!
The lady's with me.
Drop it!
And now, unloaded!
You forgot one.
The lady will have dinner in her room.
But, we don't have any room, sir!
They're all taken.
You...
-Your room number?
-Number seven
-Get the key!
-But...
He's trying to get away.
Help with the back, hurry up, cut him off.
Hurry up!
Get him! Get him!
There he goes.
Come on, go after him!
What's happened to this town?
How did you get like this?
It was... just after the war.
With all those ex-soldiers came to town.
They would led by this Caldwell.
He bought the mine.
Then, little by little, whole town.
He forced people to sell.
Using any method he could.
Then the plague began...
Because of the poluted wells.
Now Caldwell won't let anyone leave town..
.. unless they're sick or dying.
Why are you helping me?
We all have the right to be born.
Your shootings are good..
.. at the dead.
Let's go boys! Go!
George!
Say that again!
George.
I haven't heard that for a long time.
I almost forgot what it sounded like.
What happened to your bow?
They went like all the things have belonged to a drunk.
I hocked it for some booze.
But you were never drinking man!
Yeah, that's right.
I know that.
I used to have something to hope for: My freedom.
That was a long time ago.
Now the war is over.
Now you've got your freedom.
I found out what it was worth.
That's why I drink.
George, who is Caldwell?
Do you remember that?
Sounds different.
I ain't got but three strings.
I'm waiting for them to bust.
And kneel with them.
You said there was a man, caused a trouble down the saloon?
That's right, Mr. Caldwell.
Well, tell me more about it, Slade.
He shot Ben and Charlie, without even turning around.
Don't talk balderdash, man.
There ain't nobody can hit a target without looking at it.
-Without looking at it?
-You're right!
There are two men who can.
Our Pa is one, and the other is...
-You have part of my offend, Keoma!
-Yeah we're gonna get you.
Little bastard Indian!
Hey, boys!
Launch is ready.
C'mon in, Keoma!
Aren't you hungry?
Come on in!
Well, you gotta stand there all the day?
C'mon in!
Welcome home, son!
You've been gone quite a while this time.
Where have you been?
Fighting at war.
You winned it or lose it?
I just happened to be in the winning side.
-Did you see anybody faster than you?
-Not yet!
Maybe I never will.
C'mon over here, you over-grown Pappous.
What's with the town?
What's going on there?
I say there won't be no town.
They are like guns, won't defend themselves.
-Won't fight back.
-How about my half-brothers?
The boys chose the side of the strongest.
I can't blame them for that.
And who is the strongest?
Caldwell.
You used to be the strongest.
The fastest.
I used to be the fastest.
That's not the strongest.
This means you'll live a little longer.
Don't need you ride either.
I have lived long enough to find out how wrong..
.. I was about... so many things.
The great Shannon
I saw George.
Hmm..
Did you?
Pa?
-What was it all about?
-What?
The war.
I never could figure it out.
The war.
Not sure I know.
I figured after we got through slogering all the Indians..
.. we thought we gotta do something.. generous.
Thought we get the freedom to the black man.
Now we here are good. We're going back to.. end itch off the Indians.
You've been in love, yet?
Not as much as you.
Well...
Yeah...
She was quite a woman.
You must be very lonely.
You know what it is, you're searching for?
Myself, I guess.
I don't know.
I need to find out who I am.
To be the simplest of my actions or result.
I know my being in this world has something of significance.
But I'm affraid when I find out what it is, to be too late.
In the meantime, I'm a vaguer.
I keep travelling. Even when the Earth sleeps I keep travelling.
Chasing shadows.
I think that's the way you have gone when your mother died.
When you were away.
I'd like to do something, Keoma.
You know, that's funny, whole my life I've looked to death.
Looked him straight in the eye.
I was never affraid.
Now I'm old.
Dying slowly.
I wanna live
I'm affraid.
What should I do?
I can't shoot it out of my own sons.
Come on, beast. Gather around here!
Get her out of here. Throw her out!
Right out, right out!
Don't let her touch anything.
Keep her off the furniture.
We don't wanna get infected.
You better use your sister's.
-What am I gonna do?
-Don't wanna get infected by you.
I have to burn everything
I have in my room.
Get out all of you.
For God's sake throw her out,

Well, well...
Look who's here!
If that ain't our little lady friend.
Hey, what happened to your shepheroo?
Don't tell me the honey moon is over!
Move! Come on!
Whait a minute, who's gonna pay me back!
Nigger, you shouldn't step on my path like that.
That was a dumb thing to do.
You're leaving your stinking around.
I've just gotta clean it up.
But I could; but it was too many of them.
She didn't have a chance with a scum like me.
I can hardly defend myself.
They said it was Caldwell.
Caldwell?
Where is she now?
I tried,
God knows I tried.
Where did they take her?
Where did they take her, "nigger"?
They said something about the old mine.
Where the sick people are.
George, I didn't mean it!
Slade, Chuck! Find her.
It's no use.
You can't save her.
Hey lady! We wanna talk to you. Come on out!
You're deaf?
Come on out, if you don't want me to do something I might regret.
We have found her.
What's the name of the man who took you too the saloon?
Tell me his name.
You wanna die?
You got pain?
What's his name?
I don't know!
He never told me.
This is true, I promise you.
I don't believe you lady.
This is your last chan..
This is my son, George!
My dear brothers.
-Butch.
-Sam,
Lenny.
Three names..
.. one brand.
There is no use, hiding your faces.
It won't change the way you behave.
It's been a long time.
But you haven't changed a bit.
Why don't you get out of here?
You're will be never welcomed in our family.
You don't have to rush it.
Our half-brother knows how to run away..
.. when he feels like it.
That's enough with that.
Forget your family's quarrels.
These poor people, made these an accomodation.
I don't have food to sustain them.
That is up to us.
There are neigbours.
They're saying that they get it.
But 'cos the rest of the world is ignored them with the plague..
.. raging the murders.
But if we give them a brotherly hand,
We can overcome this crisis.
Will you join us?
I'll pay you well.
You'll pay, don't worry.
And my price is high.
We'll see.
Go away, stranger!
Don't try to help us.
We're already dead.
But, you're still affraid?
That hasn't changed that?
It's not for ourselves, it's for our wives and children,
And the town, for we'd infect it.
But if we rebel, or if you're trying to help us,
Caldwell will take it out on them.
It's said, for coward people like you,
That bastards, like Caldwell will going on living.
Keoma, I had to warn you.
You can't take her back to town.
The town is surrounded.
-She needs a doctor.
-Can't do it alone.
I have to do it alone.
Because I am alone.
This is my son, George!
This is your new family.
-Why did he come back
-What does he expect to proof?
That nothing's changed between us?
That he can stand our way like he's done ever since we were kids?
Well, let me tell ye, Pa!
He won't.
Times are different now.
Times are changed around here.
He's been away too long.
And the only thing that's keeping us..
.. from sinkin' a bullet to his head, is our respect for you.
You gotta put a stop into Shannonigans.
Are you that much affraid of Keoma?
Or are you affraid of what
Caldwell will gonna think of you?
Hell no, but you never give us a chance Pa.
You are too busy caring for that half-breed.
You haven't any time for us.
You've never gave us the affection you gave to him.
For God's sake we're your real sons.
Real sons?
All of you are my sons.
Since has never been any difference, you made a difference.
This is it home. You can come and go as your pleases.
And joking, you!
You can come and you can go to hell as your please.
We'll catch this son-of-a-bitch sooner or later.
Yeah. I hate to be in his boots, when Caldwell's got a hold of him.
He don't deserve no better.
He's only a goddamn Indian.
That Caldwell is a mean man.
Hey, nigger! This time's better off without that gut-puked.
I guess he ain't had enough to drink yet today.
Yeah, you're right.
When he gets skinful, he plays really cheerful.
-George?
-Yes, it's me.
This isn't the time yet.
The few more days.
Otherwise she's in perfect health.
Nothing's wrong with her.
All she needsd now is rest.
You can take her away.
There's nobody outside.
Good!
-She's staying here.
-She's sta.. oh, no no!
That's impossible.
She can't stay here.
If they find out,
It will be all over for us.
How much's Caldwell paying you not to treat the plague victims?
Oh, how dare you to say that?
I do all I can.
It won't be all the matter of medicines or contact the authorities.
Caldwell is gambling at anyone at the town, unless they're dead.
How am I going to fight them? Alone?
And there's my wife.
I have to think of her.
She's the only thing I got.
No no no, I don't wanna be mixed up in this.
So you just give up in by inch by inch.
But if you feel like that it might as well be that now.
What's happened to you, George?
I used to admire you so much.
I have never forgotten the lessons you taught me.
You were my idol.
You were the black man and I, the half-Indian.
I learned from you that the color of man's skin doesn't make any difference.
And those days you were never affraid of anything.
From a wild-cat to a grizzly bear.
And you could duel any man in town with one hand behind your back.
And now, look at you!
Both of you.
Two cowards.
What do we have to do?
Get out of town. Inform the authorities and bring back medical supplies.
But, how?
You've already said it.
We'll go like the date.
-Alright, George.
-Why are you helping us?
Who are you doing it for?
For myself maybe.
George!
-Where is he?
-Where's that son-of-a-bitch hiding?
Talk!
Are you looking for me?
We told you to keep the head out of here.
So how come you're still here?
Why don't you go hunt buffalo?
Now get going!
You miserable little bastard!
You scum!
You no good half-breed.
Get lost, hey Keoma!
-Half-breed!
-Bastard Indian!
Filthy animal!
What's it gonna be?
Three against one?
-Like the old days?
-I can beat you by myself.
Your gun.
Mine's over there.
Won't you get up?
What's the matter, Indian?
You don't look like you feel so good.
See what heppens when you go picking up fight?
It ain't healthy.
Hey, hey!
Are you dead?
Haven't you had enough?
You ain't no match for me, Keoma!
But if you want me to hurt you..
Lenny!
-What have you got in there?
-Nothing much.
Just annother victim of the plague. A nigger.
There's only one nigger in the town.
He is with his fiddle.
George, I saw him a little while ago.
-Check the wagon.
-Go ahead...
Look at the state is he now.
Get it at an empty bottle of Wiskey.
Eww.. he's disgusting.
-I told you
-Get him out of here.
Yeah, It'd be my pleasure.
George!
You can come back to life now.
The coast is clear.
Hey doc! We sure fooled them, ha?
Not yet. Don't be forgetting.
We got to make it back.
Come on!
Get me those reins.
The three Shannons.
The terrors of the west.
And you think you go inherit the legend of your father.
Why you three yellow-belly cowards couldn't even take care of one half-breed?
He wiped the countryside with you.
And you wanted to join up with me,
Be my partners.
Why, I'd rather team up with a bunch of old women.
They're right, with alikes like you.
I'll ride into town, and handle this my way.
Meantime, why don't you run home to your Pappy,
And let HIM take care of you?
Before you really get into some trouble?
Let's go!
Search every house!
Get everybody out in the street!
They're searching for us.
We go, have the back.
Okay, where is he, lady?
How dare you breaking in my house like this?
Who do you think you are?
Get out of here!
-Where do I find your husband?
-How should I know?
If you do find him, you tell him to bother coming home when all it's over.
Slow down looking at here.
I'm going right back and check out these houses here.
Alright, hurry up!
That was them running here.
-How about over there?
-Ok, I'll go back and check it.
Why are you on here?
Go get stable.
-Not even a chase?
-No!
Gotta be here, somewhere.
Go find him!
Halt!
Come on, get the hell outta here.
Gates look and go, over there.
Come on, come on!
Hey, what's the matter with Billie?
Tank passed his neck, find him!
Stand up!
Nice and easy now!
Well, well...
Look who I've found.
This way.
She's sleeping.
Take care of her!
Keoma!
Keep yourself look up behind you!
Well look who it is, it's the undertaker.
I'm just doing my duty to the town's folks.
Taking care of them from cradle to the grave.
It's torture doc! I don't know what'll those get paintless do without you.
The next thing you don't know, is how to smuggling medicines.
We made it, George!
We made it. It's easy going from now on.
Hey everybody!
We've got the medicine.
We've got the medicine!
Al, Jake! Go and get your Wives.
We've got the medicine!
We can stop the plague now.
Come on, we finally got the medicine we need.
-And we got food too.
-Come and get what you need.
You're gonna be alright, come!
We've got some medicine, and food!
And the authorities are gonna send more.
And another thing.
They're sending a federal Marshall.
Oh, thank God!
Can't believe it!
Won't be any good, lady!
Hey, see you finally found the chance to be here all, ha? Good for you.
Go on unload then, doc!
-But these are only medicines.
-I don't give a damn.
This land belongs to Mr. Caldwell.
Along with everything that's on it.
Now that you had to pay for the water, and now you gotta pay for medicine.
Hey!
I'll pay this time.
How much you're willing to pay?
Four cents.
Four cents is mighty little.
The price of four bullets.
One,
Two,
Three,
And four.
Take it.
That's your name on it.
Now go tell Caldwell that I'm waiting here for him.
Waiting for me, ha?
Well, that's the last time he's gonna have to wait.
Come on out!
I think it's about time we got rid of Caldwell.
Get rid of him?
That would be a big mistake.
Right now he's the one we need the most.
Come on, Butch, what are you talking about?
What the hell do we need him for?
I figured, if Keoma doesn't get to him first,
Mr. Caldwell's gonna make us a fine executioner.
Executioner?
Who, Caldwell?
Yeah!
We got a chance to kill two birds with one stone.
We play our cards right.
Keoma and Caldwell will kill each other.
And that's gonna leave the town temporarily without a leader.
And then?
Well, nothing's gotta stop us.
We'll then end taking tight control of the town.
Running it anywhere with time we'll want.
Now let's go to see what that two birds are doing.
Let me through!
My son's ill.
Please, please let me through!
He's quite alright. Take him away.
Nothing's wrong with him.
-Who's next?
-See Mr. Abel, just this and be good.
Ok, you take two of these, three times a day. Alright?
Hey, come on, what are you doing?
It's too early for this. It's all scheduled.
Everything's gonna be alright.
You'll see it.
Caldwell's coming. Everybody go home, and stay out of sight.
Go on, hurry, hurry!
Alright friends, he's right out.
Bring me that goddamn half-breed.
Alright Keoma, come on out!
You can't hold all against us alone.
You're wrong, Caldwell.
He's not alone.
Wolf, take your platoon, and flush 'em out.
Just like old times, Mr. Shannon!
Welcome back, George!
It's good to be back.
What are you waiting for?
Go get him!
That lousy hair flees, making fools out of your blundering, ain't it?
Hold it!
Sorry, there ain't no name on this bullet.
Half-breed!
Come on down out of there.
Or I'll blow out his head off
No!
No, Keoma!
No!
Now you see what happens, to anyone who gets in my way?
Caldwell!
You shouldn't have done that, Caldwell.
I'm sorry boys.
That was nothing I could do.
You see,
He turned against us.
He turned against me,
And against you.
He was helping that Indian.
Remember how we've done with the traitors in the war?
We shot 'em like dogs.
Here lies,
William H. Shannon.
The man we all loved and admired.
A very special sort of man.
There was no person on earth he refused to help with when they needed it.
Not one person who would have betrayed him.
Except the one he gave his love to.
His bastard son.
We learned from father to respect law and justice.
But you didn't.
Only filled with sell out his own father.
But died alone. It's not the extent of his guilt.
He betraid us all when he brought back that plagued woman to infect us.
How far can a man sink?
He betrayed his father.
He betrayed us,
And he betrayed each and every one of you, my friends.
Keoma is responsible with the death of your loved ones.
He has brought this despair to this town.
So now... what should we do with him?
Take the law on our own hands?
Drag him to the nearest tree and straight him up like he deserves?
No...
For we're honorable men.
And prefer like justice.
Take it to courts.
As it should have done with this venomous snake, in a court of law.
We already called the Marshall.
He'll be here in few hours.
And then Keoma will be...
HIS problem.
And as soon as my brother is here, and he's more than a sherriff,
All we start rebuilding around here.
Like this kind of place we can be proud of.
Where it takes, Sam!
Coming to saloon, Lenny?
Why didn't you make yourself the mayor of the town?
Keoma!
Keoma?
Keoma!
Yes sir!
We all turn this hill town,
Into a regular metropolis.
-I think I've created a monster.
-Yeah.
Hey, Sam! Looks like
I've got my hands fulled.
That woman take out cuts you to down a size.
Butch, Lenny!
Goddamit!
Come on, let's go find him!
I can't Keoma!
He'll die!
He can't die, and you know why?
Because he's free, and the man who is free never dies.

Miss Theresa.
Your father is waiting for you.
I know.
Right now, my sweet.
I don't want to go.
Poor thing.
Your father wants you immediately!
Who is the father?
Who is the father?
Who is the father?
No!
Alfredo Garcia!
He was like a son to me.
I'll pay a million to whoever brings me the head of Alfredo Garcia.
Bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia.
Bring it to me!
- Do you care for a drink, sir?
- Uh, later.
Excuse me.
- Welcome to Camino Real, sir.
- Thank you.
Enjoy your stay.
Mirado first, and then la Munica, Goldendrina, and Toro.
Sing it, brothers.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...the bus us ready to leave in two minutes. Please, let's go.
Good-bye my brothers from Ohio.
Good-bye my brothers from Norway.
Take your wooden hearts out and find the soul in Mexico.
And bring back money.
Spend money all over, folks.
Have a good time, but remember the Tlaquepaque.
Four tequila.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
We are looking for an old buddy of ours. A padre named Alfredo Garcia.
Does anyone here know him, if you please.
Mrs.
Miss?
You're sure, huh?
How about you?
No, Señor.
First drink's on the house, gentlemen.
Whatta you like to hear?
Take care of those gentlemen, Paulo.
Your wishes, gentlemen?
- Tequila.
- Uh, Tequila and a beer back.
Good evening.
Something, uh, for the ladies.
Come on, whatta you wanna hear?
Who knows?
What would you like?
How about, uh, 'I Remember April'?
I remember April. Yeah.
- Excuse me.
- What's that?
Oh, it's just an old song.
Now, how about buying you a drink?
Crazy. Gimme a double
Jack Daniels on the rocks.
We've got a live one here.
Take me to your leader.
Well, cheers, money...
How do you like that beer?
You know they brought, uh,
German Burgermeisters over here back in about eighteen hundred and something.
Who knows? Long time ago.
Some of the best beet in the world comes from Mexico.
How good you are.
How you guys like baseball?
Take her away.
I'm beginning to like basketball lately, it's a faster game, you know what I mean?
How about that Bill Russel on the
Celtic, Nineteen sixty-nine?
Now, there was a ball player.
You've, uh, worked around here quite awhile, huh?
Yeah, about six years.
Started up in the Black Cat in T.J.
Now there was a nice place.
Classy place, classy people came in there.
One night Paulette Goddard came in... and asked me if I knew...
You know a lot of studs around here?
Who you looking for?
Well, like I said, an old buddy of ours, a very close chum, like to meet up with him again.
He's quite a ladies' man.
His name is Alfredo Garcia.
Maybe you can help is find him.
He's about thirty. Sometimes he calls himself Al... Garcia.
He speaks English,
Spanish and a little French.
Quite a stud, huh?
I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
You got me.
I do recognize the name.
You know the name Garcia?
Sure, it's like Jones or Smith.
We're at the Hotel Camino Real, if you come up with anything we'd be glad to see you.
Bring that with you.
Well, don't worry, if he's alive, I'll find him.
Uh, alive isn't our problem.
Well, uh, how about dead or alive?
How about that?
Dead, just dead.
What would you like to hear?
I didn't catch your name, Mister?
Dobbs. Fred C. Dobbs.
Paulo!
What's up?
When was the last time
Al Garcia was around?
One week. At the most a week.
You know anybody around here that... might know where he is?
Elita.
He has stayed with her.
Elita.
No shit?
I'll be dammed.
Ola, Benny.
Smiley. Long way from Durango, aren't you, Pard?
Ah, lemme see.
Things have changed.
Hey... put my shoe back.
Get up.
Excuse me.
What are you doing here so early?
It's later than you think, Chula.
How'd you like a black eye?
What have you been drinking?
You're a lying, cheating, no-good two-bit bitch.
How's your, how's your cold?
What cold?
The one you had last week when
I couldn't see you for three days.
Ha, what's the matter?
Ha, what's the matter... Benny?
Ah, good evening.
Yeah, well, give me a double bourbon with a champagne back and none of your Texano bullshit... now shove off.
Three days... and three nights.
Alfredo Garcia.
Si, Alfredo.
I feel very bad, uh...
Give me a chance I'll explain it to you, okay?
Do... it.
Well, he was here and we spent some time together.
We were saying goodbye... forever.
It took a little time.
If I ever get my hands on him
I'm gonna kill him.
I'm afraid it's too late.
When he left here he was very drunk, and, uh, near Saltillo... his car refused the road and the rocks killed him.
- Jesus Christ.
- Amen.
I gotta go, Elita.
- Do you have to go?
- See you later.
Pardon.
Come in.
Glasses.
Give him your number.
Eleven. Lucky.
Bet you guys didn't expect to see me so soon, huh?
You're wasting our time.
What have you got?
You don't mess around, do you?
Right down to business.
It's really very simple.
If you give us the information we want, as to where we can find Alfredo Garcia, we'll give you a thousand dollars.
If your information is wrong... you, too are wrong... dead wrong.
Well, you see, he's uh, friend of a friend.
And I'd like to know what you want him for.
Well. that's not true. Uh, I mean,
I gotta tell somebody something right?
You're interested in money, aren't you?
Money you can spend.
Yes, sir. Indirectly.
I mean, there are other things.
Like I'd like to stay alive.
A loser.
Nobody loses all the time.
I don't like the money.
How much is it worth to you?
- We can go five thousand.
- Ten thousand.
- I go all the way or I pass.
- I... gather by that you mean dead?
That's right.
That's what I got in mind.
Well. my friend, one must do what one must do.
All we require from you... is physical proof that Garcia is dead.
What kind of physical proof?
We're well aware of the problem and we're prepared to settle for his head.
Yeah, but the, uh... head must match the picture.
It's a deal.
But I want five thousand dollars in advance.
I'll need some operating cash, right?
You don't have to kill him with kindness.
Give him two hundred dollars.
Well, thank you, gentlemen.
You've got four days.
And Benny... after that we come to find you.
Ow! Goddammit!
Change the sheets, darling.
I got another job. You hear me?
Get up!
Come on, honey.
It's your room.
- Don't!
- Up and at 'em, Goddammit!
- Oh, don't.
- Hey, Elita!
Don't. Cut it out.
Hey, I saw those guys that were looking for Alfredo... yesterday.
Did you tell them he was dead?
No.
Why not?
In this house we know nothing.
I wanna see his grave.
Tell me... did he give you a good head?
You... dirty man.
You dirty, lousy, son-of-a-gun.
Oh, don't hurt me.
Now... pack a lunch.
No, you pack. You pack, you hear,
'cause we're going on a picnic.
Oh, no.
I'm gonna find a golden fleece, baby.
What is all this, Benny?
- Just get up.
- Oh, okay.
Get up! Get up, come on.
All right... I am up!
- Up, up!
- Can't you see?
Get up.
Oh, no. Oh, don't play with my hangover, please, Benny.
Come on.
Do you want one?
Oh, yes, the paper is in the, in the...
Goodbye.
Goodbye. Hope everything goes well. Have a nice trip.
Let me pass.
I have a heavy load.
Stop here for your ice cream.
Give me a little kiss, coyote.
Jesus... Christ.
It doesn't matter, baby... as long as I'm with you
I don't give a damn.
Enough already, Chalo.
Have pity, Chalo?
- Enough.
- It's not bothering.
Hungry, baby?
A little. But not for corn.
Meat in the pot, honey.
Bravo... bravo.
- Hell, I wasn't trying to hit 'em, you know.
- I know... you weren't.
I used to shoot a lot of pistols when I was in the army.
You're a nice gringo.
You didn't have a thing to do in the army, anyway.
Oh, you'd be surprised, honey.
- Don't bug me about it.
- You are a stupid son-of-a-bitch.
Let's go.
Then we'll go to Cozumel, after that the Isle of Mujeres.
- You ever been there?
- No.
I haven't either.
Hell, I've never been anyplace I went to go back to that's for dammed sure.
I was once at a place
I'd like to see again.
Yeah? Absolutely, baby, you name it.
It's called Guanajato.
With a G. Guanajato.
Guanajato.
Yes. It's very good.
It's a beautiful... old Spanish town.
It's, uh, sixteenth century. Lemme see, sixteen, uh, seventeen century.
I dunno. I get mixed up with the centuries.
Yes, because...
This town, oh, well, never... mind.
You know, and they have tunnels built all over the town.
And on top of the tunnels there's the, the houses built.
You can see the little windows, you know, hanging out.
- Yeah.
- Beautiful, you'll like it there.
I was there once with a...
Yeah, with who?
I forget.
Can we go there? Sometime?
No, we'll go someplace new.
Can we find a new place?
With Alfredo's help we can do anything, honey.
Uh, we're not doing bad.
I'll go on doing commercials and, pretty soon you can buy your place.
Bullshit, baby, that's not my place.
Just a pit stop for a bunch of tourists.
- This time I'm moving up.
- My son.
We're moving up.
And most important, at last to me is, we're together, Benny.
We're together.
And we marry some day.
In a church.
Yeah, We'll marry some day in a church.
Bullshit, Benny!
- Naw, I mean it this time.
- When?
When?
Sunday.
Why so?
Why?
Because I figure Al's worth about ten thousand bucks.
I don't understand.
Your primera amor, my darling, has, uh, made a mistake.
And some people... want him dead.
I... You're kidding?
No, I'm not kidding.
And we're gonna get some proof.
Jesus, y...
Well, I... Not with me, huh? You don't want me to be part of that, do you?
You are a part of it.
For you or for me or do it for Al.
He wants you to be happy, but...
Didn't he always watching you happy.
Yes, I would be happy...
Well, it's good knowing what you want, Benny.
But it so happens
I don't know what I want.
You see, uh... we, we, women have so many ways.
I, I'm just shocked.
Salud Alfredo.
Salud Alfredo, right?
I guess he'd want me to be happy.
Yeah.
Yeah...
Benny?
Yeah?
Have you really thought about marrying me?
I mean seriously?
Have you?
Yes, I have.
How come you never asked me?
I don't know, but I do now.
Ask me again.
Ask me.
Will you marry me?
Coyote! Coyote...
Let's not sleep in the city tonight.
I brought some blankets and food.
Everything we need.
I'll fix a dinner for you and we can sleep under the stars.
I wanna make you so happy tonight.
- We butting in?
- Yeah, a little bit.
Well, we'll leave if you want us to.
That fire looks mighty good, though.
Hey, I think I got a cold from that chick... last week.
She was hacking like a Goddamn coal miner.
Play anything?
Not much. My wife does.
No kidding? Hey... you know an old song called Cielito Lindo...
Yes.
How about that? Hey... could she play it?
If you please.
Say, that guitar is like a woman.
Just like a woman.
She'll be good if you can get her.
She'll tremble when you touch her.
Okay, man, knock it off.
But she just keeps on getting better.
Look here what I got. you wanna borrow it?
Yeah.
Well, I think I'll just borrow... yours.
It's all right, Benny.
It's all right.
You two guys are... definitely on my shit list.
He's a rotten sport, your old man.
Let's get out of here. Come on.
I'm gonna kill you one day, you gringo son-of-a-bitch!
Oh, no, you won't, Benny.
I've been here before, you don't know the way.
What the hell, she can handle it a lot better than I can.
She sure can.
Please don't.
Please.
Gimme that bottle, Goddammit!
Son-of-a-bitch!
Hey! You're dirt!
Come on. Let's get out of here.
Come on.
I don't know what to say.
Dammit the hell,
I don't know what to say.
You did all right.
I will tell everything to the police.
No chance.
You're gonna take me to find Alfredo.
And that's our ticket outta here.
Jesus, I don't know how you can get money from a dead body,
I mean, I don't believe those people and what they say.
I take 'em proof.
His head.
- His... head?
- For proof!
But it's a crime, Benny... you're mad!
He's dead! Shut up!
Well, you want me to desecrate a grave?
Don't give me that crap!
There's nothing sacred about a hole in the ground... or a man that's in it... or you, or me.
Listen, the church cuts off the feet, fingers, any other Goddamn thing from the saints, don't they?
Well, what the hell, Alfredo's our saint.
He's a saint of our money.
And I'm gonna borrow a piece of him.
All right...
I'll take you to him and then
I'm gonna go, you know.
Cause I figure everything is gonna be over with us.
I don't want any more of that.
Oh, please, please.
Let's put it together, just... make it round and let's go back and forget about the whole thing.
We'll never talk about it again.
Jesus, just being together is, is enough!
No, it's not, baby!
It takes pan, bread... money.
We need a room for the night with a double bed.
I'm sorry, sir, but this hotel does not allow...
Now, listen...
Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin... from Mexico City.
And we're very, very tired.
And you pluck out one of those keys while I sign the register.
Understand?
Understand?
Best room in the house, please.
I love you.
Where are we?
We can ask for him at a place they make furniture.
That's it. There.
- Buenos tardes.
- Yes.
What's he say?
No luck.
Yeah?
No luck at all.
I guess we came all the way for nothing.
Lemme tell you something, baby,
I could've died in Mexico City or T.J.... and never known what the hell it was all about.
I got a chance... a ticket, we're not gonna miss it!
Now get in there! Sit down!
And take me to him!
There ain't no more chances.
Get in!
What's she say?
I think she'd like us to go.
Well, you tell her that we've come a long way to pay our respects to this man.
We're very tired.
Tell her we wanna get a room for the night.
We'll leave in the morning.
I can tell you the brandy.
Thank you.
Listen, honey... you oughta be drunk in Fresno, California.
This place is a palace.
Listen, I promise I'll put the grave back just the way I found it.
Nobody's gonna miss him anyhow.
Alfredo's been trying to beat this rap all his life.
So have I, so have you.
He loved you, but I love you now!
Think he'd give a damn if his head could buy you what you've always been looking for?
Way out.
There's a church here.
Could we go there?
Yeah.
Later.
I got to go.
I'm going with you.
No.
Hey, ah, God.
Hey, hey, we're alive.
Hey, come on. Hey!
Hey.
Ah. It's gone. hey, honey, come on, we gotta... we gotta get outta here.
The head's gone we better... we gotta get outta here!
Come on you, you gotta help me.
Sit up.
We gotta get this... this... this place.
I came to get...
Maybe you wanna... you wanna stay here?
You wanna stay here?
Hell, then stay here!
I ain't with him! Goddammit!
Stay with him! Go on and stay with him, shit!
Turn over, Goddammit!
Turn over and be in there right!
I was only kidding. Oh, shit!
You son-of-a-bitches!
Dig a me?
Have any americans been here asking about Alfredo Garcia? Huh?
Ah, yes, two men arrived.
What?
In a green station wagon, didn't ask anything.
Yeah. Get outta here!
Get out, Goddammit!
Get outta here... you son-of-a-bitch or I'll kill you right there!
Will you get, Goddammit?
Move when I say move!
You motherfucker!
Look at me with your damn fucking eyes.
Come down and tackle me, you bastards!
I'm gonna nail you, somewhere I'm gonna nail you.
You're up there, you son-of-a...
I'm gonna find you.
Damn your eyes!
Lemme see that big station wagon.
You and all the Goddamn drinking
I'm doing all the fucking work!
Why?
Because it feels so Goddamn good.
Get outta there, come on.
Sorry, Al.
Sorry!
What's so special about you anyway, huh?
Get over there.
You got something... valuable inside, huh?
Aw, come on, Al, cop it out, baby, you got jewels in your ears?
Diamonds up your nose?
You son-of-a-bitch!
It wasn't worth it, baby.
It wasn't worth 'er. and I'll be dammed if she's not keeping the best part o' you company.
You low life bastard!
There's nothing here.
Let's go!
Three days and three nights, huh?
I hope you enjoyed her... I did.
Hell, it wasn't your fault,
I know that.
But we're gonna find out.
You and me.
Good day, sir.
I'm at your service.
Scrambled eggs, very cold beer, if you please.
Wash your car, sir?
It's very dirty.
Uh, go ahead.
Where is my beer. ma'am?
Hurry. please.
I'm coming, sir.
Sir, there are a lot of flies in your car.
Huh?
Many flies.
Flies? Oh, flies.
- You got any ice?
- Ice?
Yes, yes, I have ice, sir.
Go... for the ice!
No!
No! Me.
- Where is it, ma'am.
- Over here.
What do you have in the sack, sir?
A cat. Dead cat. Used to belong to a friend of mine.
Boy, are you a nice gringo, baby.
What about a ballad for my beautiful man?
Bullshit!
Have a drink, pal!
Well, I know about graves.
What's done is done. Right?
Ended.
I've killed people.
And worse, whole lot worse.
But I'm gonna keep him.
I'm not giving him back.
I didn't do it!
But I would have.
Ah, that's just the way it goes.
Ask him... if he did it for money.
You do this for money?
You do this for money, huh?
No.
Yes.
Take it.
That's all I got. Please.
Goddamn you!
I'm gonna finish this with him!
Alfredo, señor, give it... to me.
I give you nothing.
- Good day.
- Good day.
Pardon me, uh, do you speak English?
Yea, a couple of us do.
Ah, good. Uh...
I see there're trouble here, huh?
We got some trouble, too.
Looks like we're kinda lost.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
Well, look, uh, you see we left here and we're trying to get to there.
Now, where's the cut-off?
It's right here.
But you're gonna have to take it.
Oh, oh, we're gonna have to take it.
I see. I see.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Well, I found it.
It's right here.
We're gonna... have to make our move now.
- You okay, Benny?
- Yeah.
Who the hell are they?
Just the family.
That's him.
Sure had a nose for shit!
Yeah, I could smell it a hundred miles.
Sometimes closer.
Johnny? Johnny?
Do I get paid?
Yeah, you get paid.
Hey, Johnny.
Remember how I, I used to take a shower in there.
You know that?
You don't know that.
How you like that, huh?
Hope it cools you off, you bastard!
Well, he's taking a shower now, you know?
Son-of-a-bitch.
Hello, uh...
Benny.
Hello Benny.
I thought you would be back soon. Uh...
- I guess that's it, uh?
- Yeah.
It's all here. You can, uh, you can count it, if you want to.
It's all there.
Helluva job, Benny.
- Come, I'll show you.
- Just, uh, put it on the table.
Here, Benny, here it is.
Don't you wanna check it?
Oh, we'll check it.
But you're too smart to stiff us.
How much is it worth?
How much is it really worth?
Ten grand is all you get... bartender.
Who do you want it for?
Not you guys, you don't want it.
What the hell would you want with...
No question, Benny...
The ten thousand answers it all.
Put it on the table and we'll check it and goodbye.
Go and have yourself a party or two.
You deserve it.
No.
Come on, Bartender, you deaf?
You're either that or you're a bigger schmuck than you look like.
I'd, uh, like to keep the basket, okay?
Keep it.
Thanks.
You see, this belonged to a very... special lady.
Once upon a time... she filled it up with food... and we'd go on a picnic.
We turned off a dirt road, we ate the food she prepared with her hands.
Very special hands.
And that's why I'd like to know, why you don't... take it!
Tell me... what the head of Alfredo Garcia's is worth!
And to who! Understand?
This is the man who pays...
All right, Al. Let's go!
There's a guardhouse coming up.
Somebody's waiting for us.
Take it easy, Al.
I'm here to see El Jefe.
What for?
Just tell him, uh,
Alfredo Garcia is here.
I've got something here you want.
His name is Alfredo.
I don't know what you want him for, but here he is.
Señor... bring me the money.
Welcome. I was expecting you.
Won't you join me for a drink?
I'm a very happy man.
I got nothing to celebrate.
Here's the... merchandise you bought.
And paid for.
Take... it and go.
I have everything that I want.
I have my grandson.
So go.
Don't forget to take that and throw it to the pigs.
No.
Sixteen people are dead because of...
Him... and you.
And me.
And one of 'em was a damn good friend of mine!
No!
No.
First time I saw him he was dead.
Kill him!
Come on, Al, we're going home.
Listen. Take this.
You take care of the boy... and I'll take care of the father.
Door.
Shut the door, squirrel.
Whiskey.
How are you?
Bean. Roy Bean.
Maybe you heard of me.
My picture's on the wall.
On the other side of that wall over there.
Just... robbed the Granger's Trust down in Magdalena.
That's no easy pickings.
Bonanza Stud had his left hand shot half away... and I picked two pellets of crude-iron buckshot... out of my ankle.
I always heard that a man on the dodge is welcome west of the Pecos.
Maybe I heard wrong.
You heard right.
"Revised Laws and Statutes of the State of Texas."
What's that doing here?
For the whores to piss on.
Give him a drink of cactus whiskey.
You a bank robber?
You get much out of that Magdalena one?
No.
Enough?
That's right, enough.
Buy me a drink, bank robber?
Listen, when Roy Bean drinks, everybody drinks.
Give me the money.
Let me get some of that.
I want some of that money!
- Get off him.
- Get him strung.
Yeah, that's right.
Here! Tie it!
Go.
Gun.
Come back here, you son of a bitch!
Kill him! Shoot him!
I'm going to get Marvin.
Come on back here!
I ain't through killing you!
You hear me?
All of your kind, I'll be waiting!
The first time I saw Roy Bean... he was set on killing me.
Thought I was the Devil, come to take him.
It was an understandable thought, considering all the carnage... that he had so recently brought forth.
I'm the Reverend Mr. LaSalle.
"Though I walk in the valley of the shadow...
"I fear not."
What has happened here?
These men tried to hang me, and they have been killed for it.
How many of them are there?
A lot of them.
- Who did the killing?
- I did.
They were bad men, and the whores weren't ladies.
"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord."
It was.
I'm waiting for the buzzards.
They don't deserve burying.
Maybe they don't... but they ought to be.
They are a stench and an abomination.
I've got a shovel if you don't.
I buried them because Christ had died for all of them.
It was his choice, not mine.
I am not one to question the wisdom of the Almighty.
Get my Bible.
It is in the saddlebag.
I will read over the dead now.
My Bible, please, Mr...
Bean.
- Bean.
- Roy Bean.
Judge Roy Bean.
I am the new law in this area.
- What has qualified you as such?
- I know the law... since I have spent my entire life in its flagrant disregard.
I had never killed a man before.
I'd shot at some... in self-defense or blind fright, but I never hit anyone.
So God must have directed my bullets.
Why, he even sent an angel... to deliver this weapon.
Just how do you intend to dispense this law?
With this. And a rope.
And will you rely again on the grace of God?
I intend to practice... and give him some help.
Get on with the reading.
I've turned to the Book of Psalms... and I will read from Psalm number 58... which I deem to be appropriate.
"Let their teeth be broken...
"and blunted in their mouths...
"the great teeth of the young lions.
"... He shall take them away as with a whirlwind...
"both living, and in his wrath.
"The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance...
"he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
"So that a man shall say...
"Verily, there is a reward for the righteous...
"verily, he is a God that judgeth in the earth."
What of them?
How do they fit into your scheme of justice?
The law is going to protect them.
It says that somewhere in here.
Where is she?
Who? The angel?
If ever there was one.
ŻDónde está la muchacha?
Traigala aquí.
Does she speak American?
What is your name, seńorita?
How are you called?
Marie Elena.
Marie Elena...
I want to thank you for what you done, is what I want to do.
Maybe you can explain to these people here... that I mean them no harm.
Tell them it's going to be a new place.
It's going to be a nice place to live.
I'm the new judge.
There will be law.
There's going to be order, progress, civilization, peace.
Above all, peace.
And I don't care who I have to kill to get it. Go on. You tell them that.
Tell them the horses that belonged to them vermin are theirs.
Their guns.
The land.
Just that place...
That place there, that's mine.
They do not want the horses.
They will take the horses.
They do not want the land.
They are grateful.
They do not need the guns.
You are their patrón.
You mean I own everything if I do all the getting shot at.
It is an old and fair arrangement.
And somewhat shrewd, I might add.
That brothel there... it will be my courthouse.
Place to deal out justice, place to get shot at... and shoot and hang others from.
That's what it is.
I intend to live there, regardless.
What is it, my child?
I will live there, too.
She will what?
- You don't want me to live there.
- No, I don't.
Not yet, anyway.
Don't you have parents or the like?
Perhaps she could live in that little shack off to the side.
Perhaps you could live in that little shack off to the side.
"Blessed is the Lord thy strength, which teaches thy hand to war...
"and thy fingers to fight."
I shall pray for you, Bean.
This land abounds in ruffians and varmints.
Their numbers are legion, their evil skills commensurate.
Piss on them.
That was the first and last time
I saw Judge Roy Bean.
I never got back to that country, and died of dysentery in old Mexico.
I haven't seen him since, so he probably went to Hell.
Lillie Langtry.
The Jersey Lily.
Fairest voice, softest hair, eyes the color of a starlit night.
The most beautiful woman in all creation.
That's who that is.
Why, even princes drink champagne from her slipper.
Look at the color of that hair.
I cannot see any color.
That's 'cause it's a bad likeness.
But even a bad likeness of Lillie Langtry... is worth most women in the flesh.
Get back in there, child.
Who are you?
Big Bart Jackson.
This is my gang.
Tector Crites...
Whorehouse Lucky Jim...
Nick The Grub, Fermel Parlee.
- You outlaws?
- We're honest men.
Merely been driven to a life beyond the law by circumstances.
You ever been here before?
Don't even know where I am now.
It's the Eagle's Nest,
Vinegarroon County, Texas.
Vinegarroon.
What is a "vinegarroon"?
Well, it's a Mexican word.
Means whiptail scorpion, mean as hell.
I don't want trouble from you... only food, water and some cactus whiskey... if that sign's not an idle boast.
Nothing on that sign is an idle boast.
Including the law.
Got any money?
Not much.
We tried to rob the Three Rivers Flyer.
Couldn't catch him.
The passengers shot at us from windows for sport.
Not easy being an outlaw in times like these.
Ordinarily, I'd take you in my court and try you and hang you.
But if you got the money for whiskey, we can dispense with those proceedings.
- Do you get much judging around here?
- What do you mean?
I mean, what's the use of being a judge if you ain't got no one to law?
Got a whole graveyard of previous cases.
I'll bet you could do even better if you had more cases to try.
- That's right.
- What are you getting at?
What kind of court of law is it?
Has no marshals.
I don't need no marshals to back me up.
There's Judge Parker,
Fort Smith, Arkansas...
- Has marshals.
- Right.
- A wealthy and respected man today.
- That he is.
Marshals have to be men of strong moral fiber.
Country like this, overrun with outlaws...
Rich in possibilities.
I see no reason why the State of Texas... through myself, could not provide... half the booty and loot collected as legal property of this court.
Split up four ways, I imagine.
- Five.
- Five.
Why, the State of Texas would probably pay a bonus each month.
You mean, a bonus for the man that does the most to the stopping... of banditry and "outlawlessness" that runs rampant in this land.
Providing I was able to find men of... sufficient moral fiber.
Raise your right hands.
Do you solemnly swear to uphold the letter of the law... as stated in
The Revised Statutes of Texas, 1855?
And furthermore, do you swear solemn allegiance... and vow to uphold the honor of Lillie Langtry?
- I do!
- Judge?
Can I be the bartender? I've had my fill of being shot at for money.
What about that part about Miss Langtry?
That's the most beautiful woman
I ever seen in all my born days.
By the power vested in me... through God and the great and honorable
State of Texas...
I hereby proclaim you to be marshals of the court... of the county of Greater Vinegarroon.
- For Texas and Miss Lillie!
- For Texas and Miss Lillie!
The whole thing was a mistake.
Why, I was framed from the start.
Set up by this two-bit vigilante judge and his lynch mob.
They had nothing better to do.
Besides, I was easy to catch.
This here is Sam Dodd, Judge.
Genuine murderer.
- Who'd he kill?
- Chinaman and his greaser wife.
- Stole a fruit jar full of money.
- How much?
Close to $90.
That's a serious crime, son.
Where's the evidence?
We buried the victims no more than an hour after he done it.
Get down off that horse!
I don't cotton to looking up to the likes of you.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
Court of Vinegarroon is in session.
There'll be no drinking.
Judge Roy Bean presiding.
Do you have anything to say before we find you guilty?
I'm not guilty of nothing.
There's no crime that I've done wrong.
Do you deny the killing?
I do not deny it.
But there's no place in that book where it says nothing about killing a Chinese.
And no one I know ever heard a law on greasers... niggers, or Injuns.
All men stand equal before the law.
And I will hang a man for killing anyone, including Chinks, greasers, or niggers!
I'm very advanced in my views and outspoken.
But there's no place in that book that...
Trust in my judgment of the book.
Besides, you'll hang no matter what it says...
'cause I am the law.
The law is the handmaiden of justice.
Get a rope.
Let's go, Sam Dodd.
I want to say something.
Don't I get to say nothing?
By all means.
I want to say that I still believe this whole thing is a mistake... and that I am no worse, and probably better... than the men who are about to end my days.
Well spoken, son. That's enough.
It was wrong to do this to me for the crimes mentioned... but I'd also killed white men and stole their horses.
So I figured that that's what I was being hung for.
My only concern was that that rope be tied properly... and the whole thing done right.
It was.
Verily, it has come to pass that the wicked, outlaws, et cetera... are going to have their teeth blunted like lions... with their necks stretched and broken.
This is the fate of the wicked.
And all this has come to pass
'cause it is the duty of the righteous... which is us, to hang the wicked whenever we can.
So that a man can say truly... that God has appointed a judge upon the earth.
That is how it is and the way it will be. Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Bar is open!
Two.
Two.
Two.
I'm Snake River Rufus Krile, a long way from home.
Quit grinning.
Can't stand a man that grins.
I call that bet, and I'll raise you $10.
I'm blood kin to a Gila monster.
- Can drink my weight in wolf poison.
- One.
Massacre, bloodshed... famine and drought all put meat on my bones.
I'll see that and raise you $5.
Hardship and slaughter: My daily bread.
You in or out, Judge?
I'm considering...
I can whip a full-grown longhorn cow with my hands tied.
Make violent love to mountain lions.
My trigger fingers are itchy.
I'm set to go, red hot.
Raise you $5.
Justifiable homicide.
I fine that man two bits for firing a gun in a public building.
I also fine him...
$52 for lying around.
Whorehouse, I call you and... raise you $52.
I call.
Three bullets.
The marshals found that the land abounded in opportunities.
And the pickings was easy.
Little did the varmints expect the long arm of justice... to reach them from within.
Criminal vermin was plentiful and of good value, too.
We had us a table piled high with silver in no time.
And that was just the beginning.
The confiscated property of them that was caught and hung... allowed the Judge to institute civic improvements.
Wagonloads of real, law-abiding citizens came to settle.
The Judge himself became a man of considerable wealth and consequence.
He verily papered the courthouse walls... with posters of his true and fair love.
He even sent riders to the railhead to bring back the New York Times... so he could follow the exploits of Miss Langtry...
Jersey Lily, voice as sweet as that of a nightingale.
I am... disturbed by the news this morning.
What is it, Judge?
I am crestfallen.
Crestfallen?
Crestfallen by the... report that Miss Lillie, in a playful mood at a royal outing... slipped a frog down the back of His Highness Albert Edward...
Prince of Wales.
It was in a moment of frivolity, you understand.
She slipped a frog down this prince's neck?
Anyway, the Prince was ruffled by the incident... and disfavored Miss Lillie for it.
I suppose he would.
Suppose he would?
Ought to go over there and hang the son of a bitch!
I would, too, except I got too much respect for the royal family.
- Where'd you get that dress?
- You sent for it.
It sure didn't look like that in the Sears and Roebuck catalog.
- Don't you like it?
- With all due respect to Miss Lillie...
I think she'd understand, yeah, I like it a lot.
Just don't go wearing it around here during drinking hours.
Sheriff! You better come quick!
There'll be an illegal lynching!
Hold it!
The only lynching around here will be done according to the law.
Hell, Judge!
We got the tar and we got the feathers.
What is all this about, Bart?
We, as the decent folks of this community, will not abide by pimp gamblers... and women of the night at prices like these.
- What's the going price?
- $5, that's the price!
- Gold or silver!
- Outrageous!
I'd be willing to make a special rate for you, Judge...
- considering that...
- No, sir.
What goes for my town goes for me.
Justice goes for all.
Justice is the handmaiden of the law.
- I was only trying to make amends.
- Amends!
What you have done to these... gentle damsels...
I accuse you, sir, of leading them down the primrose path.
Making them slaves to passion and the dollar.
For you, Judge, nothing.
Get those ladies down from that traveling bordello... and put them on the porch. You, sir.
Get out of my way.
That's it, come to me. I'll catch you.
I ain't going to sentence you, boy, but I am going to warn you... if you ain't out of here in five minutes,
I will open court.
- I haven't even got a horse.
- Steal one! A fast one!
Remember, we hang horse thieves around here.
Spread out, ladies.
I didn't mean that.
What do you want to do with them, Judge?
Just bear witness.
Bart, come here.
Fermel.
Right there. Right there.
Whorehouse, come here.
Right there.
- Tector.
- Yes, sir?
- Come on out here.
- No, not me, Judge. I'm a benedict.
What about me, Judge?
Over here.
Ladies...
I intend to steer you back to the path of righteousness.
I hereby sentence you to one year... under protective custody of my marshals.
Bar's open! Drinks are on the house!
I think, my dear... that you are a case for special consideration.
I hereby declare you a ward of the court.
A pig!
I likewise advise you to find a fast horse.
Hold it!
- All right, let's go inside.
- The Judge can handle it.
- Where you going?
- I am going for a walk.
Smell how sweet that air is.
It's almost tropical, that's what it is.
In the desert at night, in the moonlight, it smells like... it could be a teeming jungle... in Africa or India or the like.
And it makes me dream about this land.
What I'm going to make of it.
Someday it's going to be covered... with farms and towns.
There's going to be a railroad.
Streets... covered with brick.
Buildings made of stone, 100 feet high.
There will be factories and slaughterhouses... like I seen in those pictures of Denver and Chicago.
And I am going to have a courthouse made of granite, four stories high... so I can look down and see that everything is going to plan.
And you can have anything you want.
You just think of anything you want.
A box that makes songs.
What?
A box that you open, it makes songs.
- Music box.
- Sí.
I would get you a pipe organ.
- What songs would you want it to play?
- Any songs.
You ever hear the Yellow Rose of Texas?
No, why?
You should have.
How does it go?
Sing more.
No, I can't sing.
It's cold in that shack where you live, ain't it?
It's all right in the summer.
Yeah, but it's cold in the winter and it leaks in the rain, don't it?
Sometimes.
And the wind comes through.
Only when it's blowing.
Yeah, it is summer and the sky is clear, there's no wind.
You should spend the night in the courthouse so I can protect you... from the elements.
What are you doing there in the middle of nowhere, digging a hole?
A grave.
When that wheel come off the wagon,
I took it for a sign.
- This here's my dying ground.
- Where you coming from?
Lived in the mountains mostly.
I was a mountain man.
Knew Jim Bridger, Kit Carson,
Liver Eatin' Johnson.
He was a good feller when he started.
But things get to him.
Went bad after a few winters.
Yeah, a man will do that.
What's your name, mister?
I'm Grizzly Adams, direct descendant of John Quincy Adams... sixth President of the United States.
His blood is in me.
I went wild as a youth, ran away to the mountains.
Good life, free life, but cold.
So cold I'd go to the bears, lie with them in their cave.
That's why I'm known as Grizzly.
I cohabitated with the bears.
What are you doing in Vinegarroon?
All my life, I've been cold.
- I come south to die where it's warm.
- It's warm here.
There'll be no illegal dying.
The only people that die in my town are those that I shoot or hang.
Get along with you.
Can't die here! Can't die there! Man can't even die where he sees fit no more!
I want no part of what this world's come to.
I'm glad my days are at an end.
That's Zachary Taylor, my oldest boy... named after the 12th President of the United States.
I prefer his company to that of men.
Pick up that wheel and move on.
Or I'll have you both strung up for disturbing the peace.
Hurry up, mister, this bear ain't getting any lighter.
How about adopting him, mister?
He'll need someone after I'm gone to love and be loved by in return.
Send him back to his mother.
She run off with another bear from Colorado.
What do you think you're doing?
Come on back here and pick up your bear!
- Good heavens.
- Give Zach a good home, mister.
Or sure as hell,
I'll come back and haunt you.
There now. Good bear.
Go on, run for it. You can't bluff me.
- Go on back to your father!
- Run, Judge!
Okay, stay where you are, damn it!
- Come on, Judge, he's a monster!
- Nasty bear. You want to make friends?
Go on!
Get in there now. Go on.
Go to bed and lie down, you hear me?
I don't know which one he was talking to.
But either way it must've been one hell of a night.
The Watch Bear moved right into the household.
The Judge and him and Marie Elena were inseparable.
The three of them used to go picnicking together.
Dearest Lillie:
It was with fondest enthusiasm that I received your letter this morning.
It was delivered to me while in court.
I dared not open it... for fear that it would cause me to reel in dazed ecstasy... and forget the grave responsibilities of my position.
We're ready, Judge.
Therefore I placed it in a pocket over my heart... where it has remained warm until now.
I don't want to hurry you, but the horse is getting nervous.
Quiet, you damn fool.
Can't you see the Judge is reading a letter from Miss Langtry? Come on.
Dear Mr. Bean: On behalf of Miss Langtry...
I wish to thank you for your correspondence... of April, March, February, and January, 1895.
Miss Langtry is presently engaged in a tour of the Continent... and will make every effort to review it at her soonest possible convenience.
Most warmly yours, Dorothy P. Pilsbury... personal secretary to Miss Lillie Langtry.
Any last words?
- We already said that.
- All right, give me back my cigar.
Carry out the sentence.
Could you lower... the deceased a little bit?
He's not in the picture.
Lower him.
That's fine, right there.
All right, everybody.
The only real attempt to question the authority of the Judge's court... occurred the time Bad Bob came to town.
Not Dirty Bad Bob, the New Mexican... but the original Bad Bob, the mean one, the albino.
Bad Bob's in town!
Bad Bob's in town!
Wait, I'll go with you.
Bad Bob's in town!
- Hey, you!
- Help me!
Don't you ever question what I say.
I think you shot off my toe.
It'd be the second one over from the big one.
You go tell that snake-scum judge... that I intend to burn his eyes out and feed him to the buzzards.
Before I do, I want to eat breakfast.
I've ridden a long way and amassed a powerful hunger.
Now, listen.
You tell him... to prepare to go to Hell!
I will send him there directly. Now, git!
But what about my toe?
Now they match.
Cook him for me. Smother him in onions.
- How do you want your horse?
- Blue.
Bean!
Beano!
It's me, Bob!
Bad Bob!
I've come here to shoot your eyes out.
And then I'm going to take my ivory-handled knife... and cut your head off and sell it to a friend of mine in a carnival.
It is my intention, Beano, to rid the ground of your shadow... and take my pleasure upon this town.
I have one thing to add.
Lillie Langtry is a pig-faced whore, bitch, dog.
And I wouldn't waste my bullet on her, let alone my seed.
Do you hear, Beano?
I'm ready, Beano.
Come and get it, Beano.
Come on, Beano!
Come and get it! I'm ready for you, Beano!
Judge!
He's dead. He sure is.
He was shot in the back.
Who cares if he's shot in the back or the front.
As long as the son of a bitch is dead.
You done it, Judge. You killed Bad Bob.
You call that sporting?
It weren't a real standup fight.
Standup? I laid down to steady my aim.
I mean, he never had a chance.
Not at all. Never did, never would have.
I didn't ask him to come here.
I don't abide giving killers a chance.
He wants a chance, let him go someplace else.
Shame to end so glorious a career in such a manner.
Says in the Bible, Bobbo...
Psalm 58.
"The righteous are going to rejoice and triumph over the wicked...
"whose teeth are blunted like lions...
"and they get carried away by whirlwinds and such...
"while God judges on this earth through me."
I reckon poker had as much to do with winning the West... as Colt's. 45 or the prairie schooner.
As played in the Jersey Lily, it required boundless courage... unerring judgment, and soaring faith.
It was more a religion than a game.
The Judge considered himself a past master... but then I never knew a Texan who didn't.
- Two.
- Call.
I'll call, and raise you $2.
I'll call... and I'll raise you $23.
- That leaves me out.
- Excuse me, sir.
I believe that I'm addressing... the supposed Judge Roy Bean, am I not?
Whatever you're selling, I don't want it.
We don't cotton to drummers around here.
I'm Frank Gass, an attorney-at-law.
I'm not a drummer.
You in or out?
I call and raise you $10.
I represent the estate of Charles F. Booker... late of St. Louis, Missouri... who was the previous legal owner of this property... and all the land extending in a 100-mile radius.
I'll call you, and I'll raise you.
This silver-plated Bulldog pistol worth $10, I would say.
I am now the present owner.
I call.
Thought I was bluffing, didn't you?
Take a look.
A little queen-high straight.
You ain't going to appreciate this, Judge, but I caught me a flush. Lookie.
Beer, Tector.
Excuse me, sir, I really don't...
Don't you have better sense... or manners... than to disturb a man who's deciding whether to raise or call?
Do you know there's a city ordinance against disturbing a man... who's deciding whether to raise or call?
It's a misdemeanor.
You could be shot for it.
- Here you are, Whorehouse.
- Thank you, Judge.
That'll be $25.
Yeah, when I ain't winning, the beer's $25.
That ain't sporting.
What is a man supposed to do?
Start losing or quit drinking.
Now, hear this, sir.
I hold in my possession a grant of land... issued by the King of Spain for the aforementioned property.
Miss Lillie knows some of them kings of Spain.
It came into my possession as payment for the Booker estate.
You don't say?
Provisions for grants of land are made in the statutes of the State.
- Do you have a book of law here?
- Of course.
- Give it to me.
- Open for $2.
- Thank you.
- I'll see that and raise you.
That's a law book, not a salt lick.
I'll call that... and raise you $19.
- Too stiff for me, Judge.
- I'm out.
- I raise you $50.
- That's too rich for my blood.
I don't got $50.
Here it is. Now you just start reading that.
Article 48, section F.
That's a bad law. I just repealed it.
That is outrageous.
I call.
- How many?
- Got a pat hand.
So do I.
I have, how do you say, a full house, aces over.
Now you see here, Judge Roy Bean...
I will not be bandied around and treated in this manner.
I'm an influential man, and I have powerful friends.
So have I.
I'd like you to meet one of them.
What...
- Tector!
- Let me go!
Watch your step there, young fellow.
Just watch your step.
- There you go.
- Where are you taking me?
There you go.
Get me out of here!
Help! Let me out of...
I'm going to be eaten alive!
He'll kill you first, then he'll eat you.
Last time that bear ate a lawyer he had the runs for 33 days.
No! If only you'd just let me go.
- Here.
- I don't want your money.
It just might be a good idea to feed that bear a bottle of beer.
It keeps him occupied.
Beer's a dollar a bottle.
A dollar a bottle? You call that justice?
Justice is the handmaiden of law.
You said law was the handmaiden of justice.
- I'm going to be eaten alive!
- Works both ways.
After the passing of approximately 93 bottles... the Judge and I came to an arrangement.
Since I had only $9 left...
I was in a poor bargaining position.
It seemed that the Judge found me valuable... in defending prisoners who had financial resources elsewhere.
A spirited defense might unearth these resources.
I agreed to split the fees 60/40.
I soon had a burgeoning law practice established.
But I never forgot what that egomaniac had done to me.
I intended to repay the Judge in full someday... and I had allies.
And your hat, it's ravishing.
Absolutely ravishing.
It's good to see you. Good morning, ladies.
An act of God, like the Grand Canyon.
Haven't you two had enough for one night?
It's way past my bedtime. I'm going home.
The ancient Greeks... worshipped at the feet of Aphrodite.
They loved mortal women as well.
The same goes for me.
Good night, Judge.
And her.
And Miss Lillie.
Get out of that bucket!
You drink beer, not a bear that eats glue.
It's uncivilized.
A man has two loves:
An unattainable goddess... and a mortal woman.
And he loves the mortal woman twice as much... for having worshipped Lillie Langtry.
You, Bear.
I'll have your head, is what I'll have.
I don't want to hear that!
I don't! Don't you give me any back talk.
Rather have your tail kicked.
Skin you alive, use you for a doormat.
Your heart's blacker than your hide.
You're no gentleman, never was.
Shame on you, Judge!
Quarreling with a bear!
You see what he did to Miss Lillie?
He defiled her.
He licked her dear face.
Breathed on her... with his beer-fouled breath.
On that night, an historic and tragic attempt... was made on the Judge's life.
No one had ever seen the assassin before... or knew his motives.
But in my humble opinion... it was lawyer Gass who put him up to it.
That bear's drunker than I am.
It ain't just the Bear.
Bear?
What's all the shooting about?
Sounds like it came from the Jersey Lily.
That bear was sure raising hell.
- What's going on?
- Judge?
- Judge?
- Hurry, open the door!
- Judge?
- You all right, Judge?
Bart? What's going on here?
My God, who's that?
- Judge, what happened?
- What's happened here?
Look here, there's the Bear.
The fellow sure is dead.
- What's wrong with Bear?
- He's as dead as you can get.
- Anybody know him?
- What a mess.
- Anybody know this one-armed man here?
- Hired killer.
He's as dead as you can get.
What was he doing in here?
I don't know what he was doing here this time of night.
That bear just don't tolerate lawlessness.
- Let's have a drink to the Bear.
- Yeah.
There'll be no drink... wasted on that bear.
Wasn't worth a hoot in hell.
He'd make a spectacle of himself... for anyone with a dollar.
And he laid his profane paws on Miss Lillie.
I've killed human men... for less than what he did.
All right, let's get this assassin outside and bury him.
Bury him?
No.
I want him stuck on a cactus... reduced to flies and ants.
I don't...
I don't want him in... the same ground with the Bear.
I don't!
You take his feet, I'll take his head.
Put that arm there on his chest.
Hold his shoulders or his head'll come plumb off.
His teeth have been blunted in his head... the great teeth of a young bear.
He saw that the wicked were carried away... as in a whirlwind.
But there is a reward for the righteous... the courageous, and the loyal... and that reward includes beer... plums and grapes... and bears like Lillie Langtry.
The reward will be given in Heaven where I got no jurisdiction.
Verily it has come to pass.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Amen.
It's all changing.
The country's changing.
The railroad's coming.
People will pass by... and look out the window and never know what it took to make all this.
They won't know about the Bear.
They won't know about me.
I guess it doesn't matter.
I'm going to have your baby in the spring.
A son.
Make it a son. I need a son.
King Louis XIV, King of France, had 103 of them.
A man can't live forever.
Man is mortal.
Look at her, the brazen hussy.
You don't suppose he'll marry her, do you?
Heaven forbid. A Mexican?
The little bastard would be the only thing in town... without his name on it.
There is nothing worse than a harlot turned respectable.
A reformed anything is bad enough... but a reformed harlot is the direct wrath of the Devil.
Seems that those who have spent time giving pleasure for profit... are all the more zealous when it comes to dealing out misery.
Have you got a minute, Judge?
What's on your mind, Bart?
- We'd like to talk to you about something.
- Go right ahead.
The railroads are coming.
But we don't think the train's even going to stop here.
What with men hanging right out in clear view.
Don't get us wrong, Judge.
We ain't against hanging.
We just feel that it should be done more private.
Yeah, in Dallas they do it in a barn outside town.
In a barn?
Like they was ashamed of it?
Why, I'd rather give up hanging.
No, sir.
The law says that the guilty shall be punished.
And I say it shall be done in broad daylight... in the open, not sneaking around.
Like you was the ones that was guilty, not them.
What about the ladies, Judge?
Their delicate sensibilities?
- And the children?
- The children?
It's exactly what children need.
It sets an example.
It shows what happens if they don't walk the straight and narrow.
Don't get riled, Judge.
I know who put those ideas in your heads.
They don't deserve any opinions.
I'll do the thinking around here.
And you can tell that to your whores!
I mean your wives.
There are several reasons advanced for the fall of Rome:
The decline of the military, increase in the savage hordes.
- But I got my own opinion.
- Here they come again, Judge.
I think it was those Roman baths.
Roman generals didn't even bother to fight their own wars no more.
Swam around in scented oil, lollygagging with the slaves... stuffing themselves with larks' tongues.
- We're here for a showdown, Judge.
- Showdown?
- Yes, sir, it is.
- About what?
You weren't right, you calling our wives what you did.
- I forgot what I called them.
- The word don't bear repetition.
Whores.
They may have been once about a time.
But now they're respectable, married ladies.
- Piss on them!
- There you go again, Judge.
Lower your voice, for God's sakes.
We're in enough trouble already.
They heard what you called them.
They say we should defend their honor.
And they called us cowards, craven cowards.
Said they're going to lock us out of our houses, unless you apologize.
- Apologize?
- And they're hopping mad.
Do us a favor, will you, Judge?
They're standing out there, waiting.
Go to them real hangdog-like... as though we made you ask for their pardon.
Hangdog?
I understand you've taken exception... to my calling you whores.
I'm sorry.
I apologize.
I ask you to note... that I did not call you callous-ass strumpets... fornicatresses, or low-born gutter sluts.
But I did say whores. No escaping that.
And for that slip of the tongue...
I apologize.
"Miss Lillie Langtry and company...
"have recently embarked on an Easter tour...
"of the midwestern and southwestern states.
"They will perform one evening only...
"in the following cities: Chicago, April 1.
"Kansas City, April 6.
San Antonio, April 11."
My God, Judge.
She's coming to San Antonio.
They say that she is... at her incomparable best in The Fool's Revenge.
You should go and see her before she grows old and fat.
Miss Lillie's beauty is timeless.
Anyway, I can't.
- Why not?
- Too busy.
I got all those civic responsibilities:
Criminals to prosecute... station house going up... babies being born.
We will wait.
Get the Sears and Roebuck.
I'll need the proper attire.
When people go to see Miss Lillie, they get dressed for the occasion.
They wear tails.
- Tails?
- That's right. Tails.
Coat, vest, pants: $11.40.
Boy!
I'd like a seat in the middle of the front row, please.
We don't have a seat in the middle of the front row... or anywhere else.
I see.
- How much will it be, $100?
$200, if necessary.
Just a minute.
Programs! Get your programs!
I'm sorry, sir, we've been sold out for two days.
Price is no object.
I'm sorry, sir, we have no more seats.
Find some. I'm Roy Bean. Judge Roy...
The fabulous Lillie Langtry, as she appears in The Fool's Revenge.
Programs! Get your programs here!
- Sir, I will give you $200 for your ticket.
- Nonsense.
Could I buy your ticket for $200?
I'll give anybody in this theater
$200 for a ticket.
Take your hands off me.
I'm Judge Roy Bean.
Be easy on us, Your Honor.
Leave peaceable.
I'll go by myself.
- I'll give you $400 for your ticket.
- Excuse me, Your Honor.
- I heard you with them police.
- Get away, boy.
- I'm trying to do you a favor.
- Go away.
I work for the opera house.
I wouldn't do this for nobody else.
Come on.
I mean, you being a judge and all, talking about Miss Langtry and all.
How'd you like to meet her?
You know Miss Lillie?
I put her flowers in fresh water every morning.
Part of my job.
Did you notice any red and white roses there today?
Red and white?
Did you send those, Your Honor?
They were beautiful beyond belief.
- Miss Lillie like them?
- I can't rightly say, Your Honor.
Roses ain't her favorite flower.
But she appreciated the thought.
- What is her favorite flower?
- Tulips.
This year it was tulips.
That's what it was, all right.
Tulips?
You can get me back there?
Sure. I know the stage-door guard real good.
You can watch from the wings.
It's the best seat in the house.
But it's going to cost you.
I mean, I got to make a living, too.
And you can keep the change, son.
Thanks, Your Honor.
This gentleman is a friend of Miss Langtry's.
He'd like to see her.
I can't let him in. I got orders.
He's a judge.
Well, seeing he's a judge...
But I can't risk my job for nothing.
Give him something.
Only a fin, Your Honor.
We don't want to spoil him.
- How are you, Tector?
- Glad to have you back, Judge.
Glad to be back.
- How was your trip?
- Memorable.
- How'd you know I was on that train?
- I didn't know. I was just hoping.
Hoping?
Marie Elena's been calling for you.
The baby's fine, but Marie Elena...
She ain't...
We sent for the doctor four days ago, Judge.
Ought to have been here by now.
What's going on here?
What kind of a welcome is this?
I can't abide you lying in bed.
You had the baby. You should... be standing on your hind legs.
I'm sorry it's a girl.
Don't change the subject.
I can't abide you lying there... all pale and wan. It ain't becoming... for my bride-to-be.
How did she look?
Who?
Miss Lillie.
Oh, her.
Had other things on my mind.
Music boxes and the like.
I expect you'll be dancing to this tomorrow.
Tonight.
You'll be dancing to it tonight.
I can't wait till tomorrow.
I won't have it.
You'll be dancing to this tonight.
That's my ruling, by Gobs!
Marie.
Marie?
Howdy, Judge.
Would have been here two days sooner, except the doc was on a drunk.
He ain't in very good condition.
Got away from us once.
But we caught him and throwed him in the Pecos River.
Wake up, Doc. Come on, wake up.
You're here. Wake up. Get on out of here.
Get out.
You may take me to the patient.
Hang him.
No, I'll hang him.
No, Judge.
No. No, please.
My God. No, Judge. Judge, no.
No, please.
No, Judge. Please don't.
No. Please.
What is going on here?
You! Put that man down, sir.
What is the meaning of this?
- He's hanging the doctor.
- Well, you stop him. I forbid it.
I am the mayor. You are my officers.
As mayor of this town,
I demand that you do your duty... and put a halt to these illegal proceedings.
Hanging is the outlaw's path to glory... and much too good for the likes of you.
Judge, I think I should tell you that... in your absence, a town meeting was held...
Shut up, Gass.
...during the course of which
I was duly appointed mayor.
Gass!
They voted for me, Judge, by show of hands.
Our wives' fault, Judge. They kept at us.
I'm going home and beat mine.
Judge, can't we just pretend it never happened?
Sure. That's a good idea, Judge.
Bygones is bygones.
The Judge left everything he owned or built.
Rode off into the desert just like he came.
Time and the country just swallowed him up.
Some say he never did return.
Like the historians, they call it "a romantic fabrication."
Hell, what do they know?
How would anybody know better than me?
I was there. I saw it with my own eyes.
But I'm getting ahead of myself.
I took the Judge's little girl and raised her as my own.
Little Rose grew like a young colt.
Lawyer Gass, he took over.
With a carpet bag full of papers, he was able to steal the same land... that the Judge had wrested from the Devil... with a gun and a rope.
Civilization.
It was steps going down for the Judge's marshals.
Gass fired them... and they was forced to seek livelihoods beneath their stations.
It didn't take long for their wives to ditch them, either.
As she grew...
Rose read the same books the Judge had read.
I think she thought of him... the same as one of them ancient Roman gods.
Looking back... we had in the person of Teddy Roosevelt... the finest President in the history of this country.
He had the spirit and determination that matched the times and the land.
Then the women got the vote, and everything went to hell.
While our boys was overseas fighting the Kaiser... the women got Prohibition put in.
Drinking and gambling and whoring were declared unlawful.
All those things which come natural to men became crimes.
They went right on doing them, of course.
But in hiding.
And as if things weren't bad enough... oil was discovered in west Texas.
Hoodlums came crawling out of the woodwork.
Politicians and crime lords were bedfellows... and cops became pimps.
It was a generation of vipers.
Gass became the oil-richest man in Texas.
He hired killers and thugs from the East to run things... and kept order with his special police.
Those that stood in his way were shot down in gang wars.
Blood soaked into the mud of Langtry again.
Miss Bean, when I acquired the Jersey Lily... it was without foreknowledge of the resources that lay beneath.
I mean, it's hardly my fault that oil was struck here.
You just remember your dear father's dream, Miss Bean:
Hotels, refineries, factories.
You keep my father's name out of this.
I am bending over backwards to be fair.
Take your time about leaving.
One week or two weeks.
You take your time, too, Mr. Gass.
Take a second.
Take two seconds.
And then git.
I said git!
Be out of there by midnight, or you shall be evicted.
Evict us?
Let them try.
You don't stand a chance.
The law's on his side.
The law.
Yes, law.
I didn't say nothing about justice.
Uncle Tector.
Yes?
That man on horseback.
He looks like... something out of an old picture book.
Don't often see a man ride a horse through this town anymore.
Just some... old-timer who don't know that civilization has set in here.
Civilization? We're not going to let it swallow us up.
I won't stand by and see my father's house... the birthplace of law and order, turned into a gasoline station.
Rose, there's nothing we can do about it.
I am a Bean.
And we Beans just don't know when we're licked.
- Rose.
- Uncle Tector.
Let's give them hell.
You drunken bum. Stay out of here.
Bart. Big Bart Jackson.
Yes, sir, Judge.
What are you doing wallowing in the mud... in broad daylight like a common drunk?
I reckon that's what I've become, Judge... a common drunk.
Shame on you for admitting it.
Life's dealt me one bad hand after another, Judge... since you went away.
What kind of talk is that for a man of strong moral fiber?
I've slowly come unraveled, Judge.
Stand up, Bart Jackson, on your hind legs.
Yes, sir, Judge.
Yes, sir, Judge.
- Unbutton your ears.
- Yes, sir, Judge.
I want you to find Nick The Grub...
Fermel Parlee, and Whorehouse Lucky Jim... wherever they are.
Yes, sir, Judge.
- And meet me.
- Meet you?
At moonrise.
Meet you at moonrise? Where?
The Bear's monument. Where else?
Yes, sir, Judge.
Where else?
Here we go.
Who's there?
Judge Roy Bean and four marshals.
It ain't neither.
Who do you think you're fooling?
He's back, Tector. Open up.
Hello, Tector.
- And you are my daughter.
- She is.
What's your name?
Rose. After the song.
You take after your mother.
Sometimes she takes after you.
How old are you?
Twenty.
God Almighty.
- I've been gone that long?
- Yes.
No wonder I feel like a stranger.
Where you been, Judge?
- Down the pike.
- Down the pike?
Whiskey, Tector. Cactus whiskey.
You ain't spoke yet.
Maybe you got nothing to say.
I wouldn't blame you if you never spoke to me at all.
I ain't been no kind of a father.
You're always here, Pa.
You and Ma, and the Watch Bear... and Miss Lillie.
It'll be a little while, I reckon.
Care to play a few hands?
Come on over here and sit where your ma used to sit.
I open for a. 38.
Call.
I'll call the. 38... and raise you two. 45s.
- Not today.
- Yeah. I'm out, too.
I'll call.
- I'll call.
- I call.
- Call.
- Call.
I'll take three.
They're coming, them brown-shirted bastards.
Four abreast.
I got a pat hand.
So do I.
Open in the name of the law.
You're being evicted on orders from Mayor Gass.
Open up in the name of the law.
Take cover, men!
Pull that car over there and shine the lights.
Vacate those premises immediately or face the consequences.
We've stood for this long enough.
Raze that place.
We must be done with Beanism!
That eyesore.
That dreadful, barbarous shack.
Three. 45s.
I'll call you and raise you, three. 45s.
- I'll fold.
- Yeah.
I call.
Thought I was bluffing, didn't you?
Queen-high straight.
I got a queen-high flush.
Tector Crites, Rose Bean... come out or we'll burn you out.
Come on, let's burn them out!
Who are you?
Justice, you sons of bitches.
For Texas and Miss Lillie!
Fires raged and died.
Wells dried up.
A wind blew the ashes away, and sand covered the scars.
The desert reclaimed its own.
- Can I be of any assistance, Miss Langtry?
- How did you know my name, good man?
Why, everyone around here knows what you look like, Miss Langtry.
Everyone?
We've been waiting for you near to 30 years.
- We?
- Tector and me.
We're the only ones left, ma'am.
Come on, there's a lot to see.
The reason I walk this way, ma'am, both my toes next to the big ones... shot off by the original Bad Bob.
Mind the cactus.
This here is Tector Crites, ma'am.
He's the curator for the Judge Roy Bean Museum.
How do you do, Mr. Crites?
This here is the Jersey Lily.
It was named after...
- you, ma'am.
- Thank you.
Just like the town.
Genuine hanging rope. Notice the noose.
Frayed around the edges.
It was the Judge's favorite.
Well, I seem to be everywhere.
The Judge always said it was a shrine to you, ma'am.
The Judge.
Whatever happened to that funny old judge?
He hasn't written to me in years.
Judge cashed in his chips, ma'am.
He passed away.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I say.
Is that a bullet hole through my heart?
Yes, it is, ma'am.
- They was wild men in those days.
- Who did it?
Snake River Rufus Krile did that, I believe.
- What became of him?
- Judge shot him.
Dead. Dead, dead.
Then he fined him for some other crimes.
- Later we hanged him.
- Most appropriate.
The Judge must have been quite a character.
He was, ma'am. That he was.
His boots will be forever empty.
Get Rose's picture.
Judge's daughter got married last spring, to an army aviator.
He's an ace in the war against the Kaiser.
His plane ran out of fuel.
He landed in the street out here.
- That's how they met.
- Charming.
- Is this the Judge's pistol?
- Yes, ma'am.
Do you suppose I might buy it?
Judge wouldn't hear of that.
He would want you to have it... as a souvenir.
There's something else he would want you to have.
I found it on the bar there.
Right after the fire.
It's addressed to you.
In his own hand.
My dearest Lillie:
I take pen in hand to write to you for this very last time.
I wish to tell you that although I've never seen you... or heard the sound of your voice...
I have carried you with me in my heart always.
Your presence on this earth has given me strength and dignity... becoming to a gentleman.
Helped me to drive away the cold on a long and lonely night.
I wish to say lastly... it has been an honor to adore you.
God willing, sometime in this life or afterwards...
I may yet stand in your light and declare myself.
Forever and ever, your ardent admirer and champion...
Judge Roy Bean.
THE PROPHET, THE GOLD
AND THE TRANSYLVANIANS
Romulus, I hope that you're understanding what you're reading.
[ spelling ]
It's ok, continue, but you can do it a lot better.
[unintelligible]
I have it. ( the letter ) 
Be careful to look for the station,
I don't know it's name.
Ion is waiting for us there.
But you have his letter, right?
I have it.
Ok, ok. Continue to read.
How do you do?
Listen to them, are they talking about us?
I think that the mister wants to know who we are.
Answer him.
Yes Mister! Romania!
Village Poplaca!
Hey!
I haven't crossed the ocean for you to start smoking!
Thank you.
What is he saying?
I don't know.
Then, why are you still reading that "Bible"?
Romi...
I've drunk a lot in my day, but I've never drunk whisky.
Weak, only about 30% proof.
Try this.
This is what we call "tzuica".
Hey Romi.
Play something on your whistle.
It's not allowed here.
When you get two slaps from me, you'll see what's allowed and what's not.
Be calm, it's their business.
We have our own affairs.
Hey!
-This is our station.
-And why did you not tell me?
Then, let's go.
Please forgive us.
Tell them something in English. If not, they may believe that we are uncivilised.
Please forgive us.
Follow me!
We stay here, until they solve their problems.
Hey, I think this is Ion.
Look at him, he was photographed.
I think he is a very important person.
Probably a politician.
Hey shepherd!
You said that we mustn't enter in the conflict.
Yeah ,yeah.
Give me my bag!
At least... load it first.
You must shut up, "Mucho".
If we get in trouble, who's responsible? "Mucho" is responsible.
What is this? A Circus?
Fall out!
March!
I got it at Plevna.
From the Turks.
Spoils of war
Hey Iooooooooooon!!!
What is he saying?
I don't know, he doesn't speak like in the dictionary.
Shut up with your dictionary.
Money thrown out the window, you're stupid.
Say something, maybe he'll understand you.
Hey Iooon!
Friend.
Friend.
What is he saying?
Do you want a slap?
And don't stare at these bitches, they're not for you.
All they want is money.
Is Ion here?
- What is he saying?
- He said to play cards.
Tell him that we don't have any money.
Thanks.
Mister, if you think that you can beat me, then you're crazy.
Take the money.
Romi...
You must know that this is a beautiful game.
And when you think that I've never played before.
What is he saying?
But him?
I don't know.
I've already told you that he doesn't speak like in the dictionary.
Mister, listen to me.
When you have a seven... you're in.
What is he saying?
It looks like you've won him.
Bless me Lord.
How can you win a man by playing cards? He's not a cow.
No way, NO WAY!
But, if that's the tradition around these parts...
I'll buy drinks for everyone.
Tzuica.
What's your name?
Well Bob...
Take a shot from here.
Let's drink and get to know each other.
I'm called Traian Brad.
This is whisky.
God's garden must be huge.
Who is this man?
What is he saying?
Well mister...
We, I mean me and this boy, who is my little brother... we've come here from
Poplaca.
We crossed "The Big Water", the ocean.
I'll never forget it.
Everything I ate, was puked back up.
We're here in America for our brother, Ion.
To earn some money, our country is poor.
We even have the letters from him.
Take out the letter, don't stare at me.
And I think you know him.
Everybody knows him, look.
This is Ion.
Aaaaaa, I get it.
He says that we're under arrest.
How can I say in their language:
F.... you?
I don't know, it isn't written in the dictionary.
Romi, we're in trouble.
And this happened... because I entered in the conflict at the station.
Maybe I hurt someone.
And I've told you not to get involved!
And I've also told you on the road!
And you with the dictionary!
And, if the father from Poplaca  finds out?
I will be ashamed to meet him.
And your "smart" brother ( Ion )...
Ehhhhh now...
If I catch him, I'll break his bones.
Don't call me on my name, if I won't do this.
And you, what are you talking about?
It was better at home.
Yeah sure.
- You're very "smart".
- Yes?
Take out your whistle and play something.
Maybe our homesickness will pass.
Ehhhh, now,
I don't really want this.
Maybe you want something from me.
Yeah yeah.
Please Romica.
- What does he want?
- How should I know?
I think Ion has changed, since he left Poplaca.
But into something that's normal, around this parts.
Learn.
To work.
Be back.
Home!
To live like normal people.
What do you want from us?
It's because we won at poker?
Take your money back, and fuck you!
Brother, what do they want from us?
Hey man...
Sit next to me.
Hey...
Maybe he's a Turkish priest.
Hey Romi...
As I see it, hard work is waiting for us.
What does he want?
How should I know?
Don't keep asking me this!
Every day you're asking:
"What is he saying?".
Hey, listen here.
I think that I'll hurt this woman if she keeps talking.
Romi!
Tell this man that if he touches me... is a dead man, even that
I'll remain here for life.
Where are we going now?
I don't know, people are like shit around here.
Youre a bad man.
And a motherfucker.
I wont forget you.
Man, with this salute you've touched my heart.
Hey!
Hey, have you caught something?
Not too good.
Hey, look what
I've found.
Good job.
You've started to collect pebbles.
Maybe in the future you'll play with...
God forbid.
He says that is gold.
Gold? Ha ha.
Everyone will laugh at you.
Do you hear smart boy?
Pepitas.
Toys, dolls.
Let's go home.
I shot a deer.
Ion!
You're finally here.
- Well well, you even have a flag.
- Of course.
Come inside.
Hey Romi, wake up!
Look who's here.
What are you doing?
Oh, I see that you have a very nice household.
What was I suposed to do?
Wait for you?
Are you hungry?
Since you left Poplaca, you think you're royalty.
You have "tzuica"?
I've tried some berries from here, but we don't have a boiler.
How did you find this man?
Bob?
I won him at poker.
- Ion.
What have you been doing around these parts?
It's a long story.
And it's "her" time.
I don't even know how to begin.
7 years ago, I came to in America, I've done a lot of things.
I was a farmer, a porter, a hunter... a salesman, a cowboy.
It was very hard.
3 years ago, I was in Texas, and
I heard that here... gold could be found.
Others came too.
And yes, we found gold, and we shared the land.
We worked hard, and the things were good.
In a couple of years we were rich.
But a man caught us.
I know him.
He didn't catch me.
Everything is in his grip around here.
Marshall is his son.
- A marshal.
- He's the sheriff.
He took everything.
He took the gold, telling us that we had exploited his land. Those who stood up to him were "cleansed".
How about "lei" ( romanian moneys )?
Can they be found here?
No, only dollars.
But the only law here, Traian, is the gun.
The miners were scared, and they were subjugated.
I refused to bow down, and they were on me.
They hired a killer to 
"cleanse" me.
And I think that you've "cleansed" him.
And the defenders of the law, are looking for you everywhere.
And I....
When I saw your picture,
I thought that you were "a big man".
I was also in jail for you.
And this.... is your wife?
She's too young for you.
.... wants to be his wife.
How? He already has a wife.
He has 15 wives.
Their religion says that you can have multiple wives.
Here, he's a priest.
Ehhh, a priest.
Priest without a stole..... horse without a tail.
Is he a Turk?
I was in Turkey once, in '77 during the war.
Which war?
Which war?
In what world are you living?
In the new world.
Dear brother......
Now I'm upset.
Don't you read the papers?
How it's possible not to know, that our country, Romania,
3 years ago, in '77, had a war with Turkey, at Grivita, Plevna?
Give me some paper.
So....
We, the Transylvanians, thought that we must go there.
And we went.
We'd seldom crossed the mountains before, because it was fotbidden.
Anyway, nobody can stop me, when I want something.
I've passed....
You know how much military service I've done, at.........regiment.
How was it possible to stay at home, when our country, Romania, was fighting for freedom.
I was injured too.
I've got my military honors at Plevna.
After my return to Poplaca, the authorities were looking for me.
And they asked me a lot of questions.
Because of the poverty, by the time I got that letter from you,
I was already on the road to this place.
Look at him.
I'm here for him.
So he can learn something.
I've heard that here, in America...
Hey...
Your brother,
Ion.
Oh, Ion!
Romi.... you've grown.
And Bob.... very happy.
You saw that I'm wanted for 500 dollars.
Dead or alive.
But, we'll see about this.
Now that you're here, we'll try to make some rules.
No!
No rules, we're going home.
I have money.
I've won it in one minute.
Hey, the people here are stupid at playing their games.
I was showing my cards, they were giving me money....
So, no rules.
On the ship, and home.
- Brother?
- Yeah?
Sometimes the way back is longer.
Look what I've found.
What have you found?
It looks like gold.
Bob says that it's gold.
Yeah, you only see gold.
I want to learn this.
I'll teach you.
Go to the bottles.
Ion, are you calling that a gun?
Look here.
I got this from the Turks.
Romi...
Come here.
You can have this.
If someone will shoot you,
I'm gonna kill you.
You'll demolish the fence.
Wait....
Hey priest..... get off the horse.
We have some problems to solve.
Get down!
Walk!
Ion...
I'll judge this one.
Girl, Romi!
Come here.
You see?
You tied me, right?
And you whipped me!
You've done all this to me, to me?
You can't do this.
I've faced the Turks...
He doesn't even know how to fight.
Romi!
Are you missing my slaps?
Common, rub my back.
Bob's place... with... the table.
What is he saying?
He says that he wants to come with us.
Wait till they see us with him in Poplaca.
Ion...
Come here.
Now, we're going home, give me your toy.
- Which toy?
- The gun.
Ion?
What do you think?
 -Can we find here a Romanian priest?
 - Yes.
I'm afraid to not be ashamed.
Get up, girl. Get up!
Whoa!
Little Josey!
Come on in. Let's get you cleaned up.
Better go.
Josey!
Pa!
Ashes to ashes...
...dust to dust...
...the Lord gives...
...the Lord takes away.
The name's Anderson.
Bloody Bill is what they call me.
Redlegs?
You'll find them up in Kansas.
They're with the Union.
And we're going up there and set things aright.
I'll come with you.
All that a fellow has to do...
...is ride into that Union camp down there...
...raise his right hand and swear you'll be loyal to the United States.
Then he can take up his horse again...
...and go home.
They'll give us full amnesty then?
Yep.
Everyone else has done it but us.
We're the last holdouts.
I'm going in. I've had enough.
Better go with them, boy.
You coming with us?
I reckon not, Fletcher.
They'll be coming after you.
Yep.
There's nowhere to go to get away.
I reckon that's true.
Good luck.
Put the rifle down too.
- I'll need it for squirrels and such.
- Put it down.
Kind of young, ain't you kid, to be riding with this rabble?
Who you calling rabble, you blue scumbelly?
Hell, we showed these boys, anyway.
Lee might have had to surrender, but we didn't.
- Shut up, kid.
- Yes, sir.
You showed us.
Now get in line...
...before I kick you so hard you'll wear your ass for a hat.
Here's the man you asked for, sir.
- Fletcher. Good to see you.
- Senator.
Well done.
Thank you.
What the hell is this Redleg doing here?
You said regular federal authorities would handle this.
Captain Terrill is the regular federal authority now.
Captain Terrill is a bloodthirsty son of a bitch!
He is a looter and a pillager!
He's those men's worst enemy!
The war's over.
Our side won the war.
Now we must busy ourselves winning the peace.
And Fletcher, there's an old saying:
To the victors belong the spoils.
And there's another old saying, Senator.
Don't piss down my back and tell me it's raining.
Which side is this man on, Senator?
Easy. He brought them in, didn't he?
- All but one.
- Who's that?
Josey Wales.
Josey Wales.
Captain Terrill, I want you to currycomb the countryside.
You beat the brush and root out everything disloyal...
...from a Shanghai rooster to a Durham cow!
We've got to clean up this country.
Now you take 5 men and go up there and get Josey Wales.
Captain Redlegs Terrill and 5 men against Josey Wales?
We stopped those bushwhackers pretty good during the war.
You go with Captain Terrill.
Bring in this damn insurrectionist rebel.
Here's the money for bringing the others...
...and there'll be more for Josey Wales.
I've had enough of your money, Senator.
Let Wales be.
Let me be.
I'm finished with you.
All right...
...I want you men to raise your right hands.
What for?
So you can pledge loyalty to the Union.
Hell, pledge loyalty to the Union?
You ought to have us turn around and bend over.
All raise your right hands so
I can take your oath.
I pledge...
...that I will be loyal to the United States of America.
I pledge that I will be loyal...
...to the United States of America.
That I will...
Let's see. I will abide by its law...
...that I will never bear arms against it...
I will abide by its law...
...that I will never bear arms against it.
...and recognize...
...that it is one nation.
And recognize...
...that it is one nation.
- I ain't doing it.
- Come on, kid.
Let's get this over with, damn it!
But I been thinking.
I think it's them who owes an apology.
And I further swear, that though...
...I be murderous...
Look! That's Josey!
Verminous, lying, Missouri scum!
Damn you, Senator!
You promised me those men would be decently treated.
They were decently treated.
They were decently fed...
...and then they were decently shot.
These men are common outlaws, nothing more.
Run for it, Fletcher, it's a trap!
Josey, we best be on our way.
- Get moving, boy.
- They're coming after us.
We've got to take to the brush!
You get going!
You can't get them all.
That's a fact.
Why you doing it then?
I've got nothing better to do.
Fletcher was in with them.
It was a trap!
Fletcher?
Never would have figured that.
You dumb kid.
I've got to tell you something.
I'm scared of dying.
Move out!
You are going after him, after all.
Fletcher, I'm giving you a commission.
Hound this Wales to kingdom come.
Hound him, Senator?
A man like Wales lives by the feud.
Because of what you did here today,
I've got to kill him.
He'll have to run for it now.
And hell is where he's headed.
He'll be waiting there for us, Senator.
Don't hold back on account of me.
I can ride.
I ain't holding back on account of you, you thick-headed grasshopper.
If we ride in the open, there's enough posses over in South Missouri...
...to start another war.
And if we try riding instead of thinking...
...we'll end up hanging by a rope by nightfall.
Where are we headed?
The Indian Nations.
It's a good place to hole up and get you healed up.
Then we'll go get Fletcher?
Right, boy.
Then we go back and get Fletcher.
There's some riders coming up behind us.
Get down here, boy.
Lay across his neck.
Keep him down there.
Can you hear me?
Now if you see me get up, you stay there, understand?
If you hear shooting and me headed back north...
...get back on that horse.
He'll get up with you...
...and you head south, now you hear?
You can let him up now, boy.
Let him up!
Get up, goddamn it!
Whupped them again, didn't we?
Whupped them again, boy.
Ten years I've been ferrying
Kansas Redlegs...
...Union Cavalry, Missouri guerrillas...
...you name it!
Mad dogs, them guerrillas!
You look sideways at them...
...they kill you!
Hard men to do business with.
You bet!
You know, in my line of work...
...you got to be able either to sing
"The Battle Hymn of the Republic"...
...or "Dixie" with equal enthusiasm...
...depending upon present company.
Can't say as I blame you for that.
Only good business to play it safe.
Thank God they all been disarmed now...
...except for a few of the nastiest ones...
...who they're busy running down.
Where I'm going, they know how to handle that kind.
Where are you headed?
I'm going to ply my wares down in Texas.
Texas, huh?
How much for the ferry ride?
10 cents.
By coincidence, I happen to have a bottle of this remarkable elixir...
...for that exact amount.
I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there is not forgotten
Look away look away
Look away Dixieland
Sim Carstairs is the name.
Mister...?
Figured we'd give you some ferrying business.
With pleasure!
Bill Quantrill used this ferry all the time.
Good friend of mine.
What have you got there?
Just the store with
Granny Hawkins up there.
I'll tell you what.
We'll all just amble over to that store.
Him and me will ride.
We've got a touch of the cramp.
You're in luck!
I just happen to have the perfect thing here for cramps.
We'll need half a side of bacon...
...ten pounds of beef jerky, twenty pounds of horse grain.
And when we get over there, there won't be any need for you to go inside.
Just tell Old Granny through the door we'll need a lot of clean bandages...
...and a boiled poultice for a bullet wound in a hurry. Come on.
So you'll be Josey Wales.
How might you know that, Granny?
Soldiers were here looking for you 2 hours ago.
I was going to mention that to you as soon as I got the chance.
They say you killed your own men.
Those lying blue scumbellies!
They say you're a hard-put and desperate man.
They're going to heel and hog you to a barn door.
You know what I say?
What's that?
I say that big talk's worth diddlysquat.
Now them poultices be laced with feather moss and mustard root.
Mind you drop water on them occasionally and keep them damp.
Much obliged, Granny.
You can pay me when you see me again,
Josey Wales.
I reckon so.
That sure is a sweet sound to the ears...
...wouldn't you say so, Mr. Wales?
Your young friend can use some help.
This is it. One dollar a bottle.
It works wonders on wounds.
Works wonders on just about everything.
It can do most anything.
How is it with stains?
Here we go.
Dismount. Disembark, children.
Get that back!
Bring it back!
Bring that barge back!
Bring it back!
Whupped them again, Josey.
They're hollering for me to come over!
I can't hold on.
But I'll hold on until you fellows get out of sight.
All right?
I'll make do something's wrong...
Pull, Lemuel. Pull!
I'll make do something's wrong, until you get going.
I wish you all lots of luck.
Pull, Lemuel, pull!
He ain't going to hold up no ferry.
He's going to bring that cavalry over fast as he can.
Reckon there's a nice reward out for us about now.
We got him now.
We'll get those two first, then the others.
What others?
Wales and the kid are the last ones.
Texas is full of rebels.
Lots of work to do down in Texas.
We get Josey Wales and it ends.
Doing right ain't got no end.
We best hurry on, Josey.
They'd catch up to us by the end of the day.
Judging by these tracks, there's maybe...
...40, 50 horses ahead of us.
What we've got to do is space some time between them and us.
What are we going to do?
Stay right here.
Welcome.
Welcome, gentlemen.
Pull, Lemuel.
He's still there.
What does he think he's doing?
Don't know.
Some of you men get down there.
Prepare to fire.
Captain Redlegs...
...I advise you to turn back.
You can catch him later.
Turn back? Are you crazy?
He'll try to pick us off one by one.
He'll never do it.
At best, he'll get 2 or 3 up front.
I advise you to turn back, Captain.
They're coming.
Do you really think you can shoot all those men down...
...before they shoot you?
No, Mr. Josey Wales!
There is such a thing in this country called justice.
Well, Mr. Carpetbagger...
...we've got something in this territory...
...called the Missouri boat ride.
God Almighty!
Is it bad?
It's bad.
Don't look at it, boy.
It'll just make you get feelings in it.
If I don't make it...
...I want you to know...
...I'm prouder than a game rooster to have rid with you.
You are a game rooster.
Now shut up.
You could make it without me.
Take a little drink of this.
This here linsey-woolsey shirt I got that all you boys wore.
We didn't have no ma.
So Pa did all the fancy needlework for me.
Told me not to tell no one.
Imagine a grown man doing that for his own kid?
Sang a little song while he sewed it.
You know Rose of Alabama?
River rolled
The crickets sang
The lightning bug
He flashed his wing
And I could rope
My arms I fling
'Round Rose of Alabama
Now you just do that, cousin.
You bring that old pistol right out.
We got him, Lige.
It's him, Abe. It's him.
We got the Josey Wales, Abe!
I seen him ride side by side with Bloody Bill.
We got reward money coming.
Watch it, Abe.
He's meaner than a rattler and twice as fast!
You're a real bush hog, ain't you, Mr. Josey Wales?
Tell you what.
Move on back. Move on back!
Watch him.
I seen him do some things.
Shut up, Lige!
Now...
...Mr. Josey Wales...
I'd just as soon shoot you now...
...except it'd be hard to drag your body to where we can get our price for you.
Shoot him now!
Shut up, Lige.
Move your left hand down and unbuckle that pistol belt.
Make it nice and slow...
...so I can count the hairs on that hand.
See, Lige?
You pull his teeth...
...he's harmless as a heel hound.
Always wanted to face out one of these pistol fighters they all fuss about.
Only way you handle them.
Abe, watch out.
- He's probably got another pistol...
- Shut up, Lige.
Call Benny back there on the horse.
Benny! Come out!
We got us the Josey Wales!
Who is that?
He's just a boy. He's got a fever.
Tell him to shut up.
Pa?
Is that you, Pa?
It ain't your pa!
Now shut up!
I got the gold right here, Pa.
What gold is he talking about?
There's no gold. He's crazy.
The gold me and Josey robbed from the bank.
Take a look under that blanket.
I got it right here.
Thought you could use some help.
You get those holes leaking, I'm going to whomp you with a knotted plow-line.
They ain't honest.
I feel as pert as a rutting buck.
Good.
Because I ain't hauling you all over hell's creation...
...dribbling blood over half of Missouri.
Wish we had time to bury them fellows.
To hell with them fellows.
Buzzards got to eat, same as worms.
A real frog strangler.
10, 20 more miles and we'll be safe in the Nations.
Some cavalry between us and the Nations.
We'll have to wait till they bed down...
...then walk through quiet.
Here, have some beef jerky.
Don't swallow nothing but the juice.
I'll go have a look-see.
You feel all right?
I feel real good, Josey.
We got them whupped.
I want to thank you.
For what?
For saving my life.
Forget about that, Jamie.
You know something, Josey?
I ain't scared no more.
We can start working our way through now, boy.
This rain is giving us the...
This boy was brought up in a...
...time of blood and dying, and never questioned a bit of it.
Never turned his back on his folks or his kind.
I rode with him, I got no complaints.
The bluebellies will give you a better burial than I can, boy.
My name is Josey Wales.
I've heard of that name.
Some said you'd be headed this way.
And they said a man could get rich on reward money...
...if he could kill you.
Seems like you were looking to gain some money here.
Actually, I was looking to gain an edge.
I thought you might be someone who would sneak up behind me with a gun.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
It ain't supposed to be easy to sneak up behind an Indian.
I'm an Indian, all right.
But here in the Nation, they call us the civilized tribe.
They call us civilized because we're easy to sneak up on.
White men have been sneaking up on us for years.
Cherokee, huh?
They sneaked up on us and they told us we wouldn't be happy here.
They said we would be happier in the Nations.
So they took away our land...
...and sent us here.
I have a fine woman...
...and two sons.
But they all died on the
Trail of Tears.
And now the white man is sneaking up on me.
Again.
Seems like we can't trust the white man.
You bet we can't.
I wore this...
...frock coat in Washington.
Before the war.
We wore them because we belonged to...
...the five civilized tribes.
We dressed ourselves up like Abraham Lincoln.
We got to see the
Secretary of the Interior.
And he said...
..."Boy! You boys sure look civilized!"
He congratulated us...
...and he gave us medals for looking so civilized.
We told him about how our land had been stolen...
...and our people were dying.
When we finished, he shook our hands...
...and said...
..."Endeavor to persevere."
They stood us in a line.
John Jumper, Chilly Mclntosh...
...Buffalo Hump...
...and Jim Pock Mark and me.
I'm Lone Watie.
They took our pictures.
And the newspaper said...
..." Indians Vow to
Endeavor to Persevere."
We thought about it for a long time.
"Endeavor to persevere."
And when we had thought about it long enough...
...we declared war on the Union.
Sergeant said this kid tried to ride through their camp. They got him.
They did, did they?
They've had men on guard here night and day.
No way Wales could get to the Nations.
Where are you going, Fletcher?
I'm heading into the Indian Nations.
Why don't you stay here, Redlegs?
Wales may be back in a year or two.
When we get to the Nations,
I want you men to fan out.
$5000 to the one who gets him.
A horned toad can tell you which way to go.
I used to know these things when I was young.
But when I got civilized,
I forgot all these things.
I didn't know which way to go.
The horned toad says we should go to Mexico.
Well, Mr. Lone Watie...
...you can take your horned toad down Mexico way.
I've got some unfinished business in Missouri.
I heard General Joe Shelby...
...and some men refused to surrender.
They're going down to Mexico.
I think I'll join them.
Shelby, huh?
I didn't know others hadn't surrendered.
I didn't surrender, neither.
But they took my horse and made him surrender.
They have him pulling a wagon up in Kansas, I'll bet.
You haven't got a horse.
What do you plan on doing, walking to Mexico?
No, there's a trading post right near the Creek Nation.
They got horses to trade.
You have any food here?
All I have is a piece of hard rock candy.
But it's not for eating.
It's just for looking through.
All right.
I'll get you a horse.
What have you got there?
Muskrat.
Muskrat?
What the hell's that?
Muskrat.
No, sir.
You got to come up with something more.
- Beaver?
- Beaver ain't no good no more.
Get me 10 muskrats...
...and 30 beaver pelts...
...and I'll give you red cloth.
Now that's a very good bargain for you.
Here.
You go have a drink and think about it.
You bring some drink inside, you hear?
I'll tell you, this jerky?
Put it on our bill.
What about these cougar pelts?
Going to put them on our bill too?
This what you give those Indians.
Where's the real stuff?
What do you take for the squaw?
She ain't for sale.
I mean, she ain't mine.
She works here.
See that nose scar?
Know what that means to a Cheyenne?
One too many bucks.
Little squaw likes the bucks, huh?
Tell you, Zukie, you put her on the bill too.
I'll be looking for a horse.
A horse?
The horses belong to these gentlemen.
More than likely...
That is...
...I'm sure they'd sell you one.
Look, I've got some beer.
Some good brewed choc.
It's on the house.
You suppose these gentlemen will be...
...available to discuss business before long?
Give me a bucket of that choc.
I got him!
I got me Josey Wales!
5000 gold simoleons walked right in.
- Right to us.
- Wait a minute!
He's in my place.
I recognized him too.
I'm due an even split.
Mr. Chain-Blue Lightning himself.
The one that everyone's so scared of.
Well, Mr. Lightning...
...move a muscle, twitch a finger...
...and I'll splatter your guts all over the wall.
When I say move...
...you move real slow...
...like molasses in wintertime.
All right, drop that hammer.
Now, just ease your hands down.
Take them guns out, butt first so's you can get hold of them.
You understand?
Nod, damn you!
Now...
...ease them pistols out.
Well, let's see...
...you say those horses belong to them pilgrims?
I'm getting better at sneaking up on you like this.
Only an Indian can do something like this.
That's what I figured.
You figured?
Only an Indian could do something like that.
It's not right, this damn woman doing something like this to me.
I used to have power.
Now old age is creeping up on me.
I think it's more like old habits than old age.
Who the hell is this woman?
She was back at the trading post.
Got in some kind of trouble.
She's not going to Mexico with us.
With us?
Now wait a minute. I got you a horse.
You're on your own now.
I've seen a lot today.
I've seen patrols of soldiers all day.
Everybody's looking for you.
She's not going with us.
She says she's Navajo...
...but she was captured by the Cheyenne.
She was violated by one of the bucks of the Arapahos.
Their sign is the dirty nose sign.
Cheyenne Chief, Black Kettle...
...figures that she did not resist enough.
Hell, man, can't you get her to shut up?
Anyway, she says...
...when she came to that trading post...
...she didn't know this man,
Zukie Limmer...
...was selling liquor.
She also wants you to know...
...that although he beat her a lot...
...nothing happened between them.
And she says you are a great warrior...
...and that she sort of belongs to you for what you done for her.
Look, you tell her I don't want nobody belonging to me.
That meal was damn good.
I'm going to take up tepee living if it's like this.
You know, she thinks I'm some kind of a Cherokee chief.
I wonder where she ever got that idea.
Chief!
I was just wondering.
I suppose that mangy hound's got no place else to go either.
He might as well ride along with us.
Hell, everybody else is.
Hey, you!
Want to buy some Indian scalps?
Nasty habit, young fellow.
You born in the barn?
The wheat is from Kansas and the molasses comes from Missouri.
We'll do without molasses.
Anything from Missouri has a taint about it.
Grandma, you've got to tread lightly now we're here in Texas.
Lots of nice elements from
Missouri coming West.
Nothing nice comes from Missouri.
And treading lightly is not my way.
We're from Kansas.
Jayhawkers, and proud of it.
I know how you feel.
I'm a Hoosier, myself.
Personally, I don't think much of Hoosiers neither.
Yes, friends, yes!
This is a positive remedy for weariness...
...turgidity of the bowels and...
Say, you're an Indian, aren't you?
You speak any English?
Well, sir, this is the very best thing...
...for those who can't handle their liquor.
What's in it?
I don't know. Various things.
I'm only the salesman.
You drink it.
What's that?
You drink it.
What can you expect from a nonbeliever?
That old lady don't know the trouble she can get into talking like that.
Too many folks around here with thin skin.
Lots of Southern boys been getting into trouble here.
Cullen Baker and Captain Bob Lee been fighting over in Fannin County.
Bill Longley, Creed Taylor...
...and all them other Taylors down in Gonzalez.
Killed Simp Dixon over in Cotton Gin...
...weighted him down with lead.
I got a picture postcard of it.
Here. Have a look.
Josey Wales.
What say?
Josey Wales.
They say he's coming into Texas.
Won't come through here though.
Killed 50, 60 men.
Regulators are all over the place looking for him.
How much for all this?
Three dollars.
Those regulators would pay plenty...
...to the man who could identify Josey Wales.
Reckon so.
How about you, sir?
Just a few bottles left.
You won't regret it.
Oh, my God!
It's Josey Wales!
You going to pull those pistols or whistle "Dixie"?
Goddamn Indian squaw!
Let's go!
Welcome to Texas, Mr. Lone Watie.
I guess we ain't going to see that little Navajo girl again.
I guess not.
I kind of liked her.
- But it's always like that.
- Like what?
Whenever I get to liking someone, they ain't around long.
I notice when you get to disliking someone they ain't around long neither.
How did you know which one was going to shoot first?
That one in the center had a flap holster...
...and he was in no itching hurry.
And the one second from the left...
...had scared eyes.
He wasn't going to do nothing.
But that one on the far left...
...had crazy eyes.
Figured him to make the first move.
And the one on the right?
Never paid no him no mind.
You were there.
I could have missed.
Yes, sir! It was Josey Wales, all right!
Saw him heading north out of town with a renegade Injun.
I can identify him.
And I'd certainly be glad to share in any reward.
Knew him quite well, actually.
Well, not a hard man to track.
Leaves dead men wherever he goes.
He's heading north now...
...riding with a renegade Indian.
He's heading north now, but he'll turn southwest...
...head for Mexico.
Then we'll turn southwest and head for Mexico.
Tell them to head north.
What are you talking about?
Look at those boys over there with tied-down guns.
Bounty hunters.
Come out of a war, got no other way to make a living.
Every last mother's son of them wants that money you've got on Wales' head.
You and me didn't ride all that way for that.
I don't want to hear Wales is dead.
I want to see Wales dead.
We're heading north, men.
Let's ride.
They're following us.
Couple of horses, far off, moving fast.
I don't hear nothing.
Got to be an Indian to know those things.
All right, let's take them out in the sand.
Glad you stopped me when you did.
I might have killed her.
I noticed that.
She got some supplies...
...and our horses...
...and followed us around.
She said we were the only kin she had.
I bet we are, at that.
You know, every man I ever knew...
...who was good with a gun and lived...
...always had an edge.
Some of them would like to have the sun behind their back.
That's always a good idea.
Sure pays to have an edge.
All kind of edges.
Howdy.
Is something wrong?
I guess you were right.
I ain't that old, after all.
Not many men west of here.
We're getting into Comanche country.
Wagon tracks.
But I never seen tracks like these.
Never heard of Comanches traveling in two-wheeled carts.
Comancheros...
...trade liquor and guns to Comanche for horses.
Trade women too.
How many?
Eight...
...maybe nine horses, and a couple of carts.
Those poor pilgrims from Kansas.
They don't look too proud now, do they?
You son of a bitch!
Ten Bears is going to want a fresh woman!
Fresh, that little gal will bring maybe 20 horses.
Now if one of you has to, take that old woman over there.
She might be worth maybe one donkey.
Fix yourself.
Move faster!
If you fall...
...they'll let you die.
Keep walking.
Come around here, bitch.
Come around here.
Now you listen to me.
I want you looking real good when we get to Ten Bears.
So I want you to jump in that wagon and put on one of your best little dresses.
It might boost your price.
If you look good enough, I might outbid old Ten Bears and take you for myself.
If I figure this right...
...we're facing the sun.
This ought to give him an edge.
Who are you talking about?
What the hell does he want?
Looks like a parlay.
Are you just going to sit there or you going to see what he wants?
Get ready, little lady.
Hell is coming to breakfast.
That's a mighty nice horse you got there, mister.
Would you sell it?
We will give you a good price.
Now spit!
Just get off the horse.
Get out of the way!
Now you'll kill us, I suppose.
I'd have been halfway to Mexico by now except for that crazy squaw.
I can't understand a word she says.
I knew that would bring you.
Help us!
Help us.
Comanches.
They won't like us killing these friends of theirs. We better get moving.
Looks like a family of hogs just moved out of the seat of these britches.
I had such beautiful clothes...
...I was taking to our ranch.
Whereabouts is this ranch?
My son's ranch, he found before the war near a town called Santo Rio.
Creek with good water...
...trees, cattle, black-tailed deer.
It's a regular paradise we're headed to.
Out there?
Your son told you this was out there?
He told me that.
Near a place called Blood Butte.
My son was true-blue, Mr. Wales.
He never lied.
It'll be there, all right.
Yes, ma'am, I'm sure it will be.
Cottonwoods, live oaks...
...wild horses...
...antelope...
...Iots of quail.
You see them?
What?
The clouds over there.
Clouds are like...
...dreams floating across a sky-blue mind.
I never thought of them that way.
Indian...
...this Mr. Wales is a cold-blooded killer.
He's from Missouri...
...where they're all known to be killers of innocent men, women and children.
Would you rather be riding with
Comancheros, Granny?
No, I wouldn't.
What'll you have?
Whiskey.
Whiskey, he says!
How about something else?
Beer, then.
And get those gents whatever they're drinking.
You too, ma'am.
That's mighty decent of you.
Been a long time since anybody bought a drink around here.
About as long as we had anything to drink around here.
Or anything else.
Yeah, first the silver run out of the Santo Rio.
Then the people run out.
Then the whiskey.
Then the beer run out.
Well, no matter.
It's good to see a high roller wander through.
I didn't mean to offend him.
I guess some fellows just don't like to be called high rollers.
You know, I knew a fellow once, he didn't like to be called highhanded.
We'll have whiskey all around.
Comanchero brand.
Angels of Mercy come to Santo Rio!
This ain't Santo Rio.
My son, Tom Turner, said it was a thriving place.
It was.
But when the silver ran out, the thriving ran out.
That's right.
I do declare.
Might you be the mother of Tom Turner...
...whose Crooked River Ranch is over by Blood Butte?
That I might, miss.
I am Rose.
Rose of Santo Rio.
I reckon he wrote you all about me.
I don't recollect that.
After his Lucy passed on...
...he didn't show much interest in women.
My sonny-boy kept his nose to the grindstone, providing a future for me...
...and his daughter there.
I do seem to recall him telling me something about...
...a daughter who was a little...
...odd.
He was killed in the Border War by Missouri ruffians.
He died a proud member of
Senator Jim Lane's Redlegs...
...fighting for the just cause!
I am sorry to hear that.
I mean, he was of the finest sort.
Señora, please sit down.
You must be very, very tired.
I am deeply sorrowed to hear this.
In past years...
...my friend and I were of service to your Tom Turner.
And now we are at your service.
Why, I appreciate your concern.
I am glad to find manners at last, here in the wilderness.
We have endured hardship of the worst sort on the way out here.
Grandpa Samuel and Uncle Enoch...
...fell prey to Comancheros.
Let's drink to the silver running out.
Gave us some peace and quiet here!
Bad luck, the silver running out.
I wouldn't have any other kind!
What'll you have?
I'm looking for Josey Wales.
That'll be me.
You're wanted, Wales.
Reckon I'm right popular.
You a bounty hunter?
A man's got to do something for a living these days.
Dying ain't much of a living, boy.
You know, this isn't necessary.
You can just ride on.
I had to come back.
I know.
- Comanche?
- Comanches, all right.
Any more of them?
I think that's all there is...
...but they have horses packing antelope...
...so I figure they're not a raiding party.
But you never can tell these Comanches.
You stay with the cart.
Just looking us over, I guess.
They're packing heavy.
They may return.
All right, let's move out.
If they ride with Ten Bears...
...they will come back.
Ten Bears is the greatest
Comanche war chief.
But he's angry.
Each year, he has met with one of your bluecoat generals.
Ain't my generals.
And each year he is pushed further across the plains.
General Sherman has come with more promises.
But Ten Bears will move no more.
It's so beautiful.
All right, we can get to work dusting first.
Got a nice Dutch oven in the fireplace here.
Mr. Wales, you men chop some wood.
Now, get everything done.
Mr. Wales!
Did you come all this way to gawk?
If you don't work, you don't eat around here.
Didn't figure you for a loafer.
You know, she told me...
...it's the first time she ever had a place of her own.
Grandma says it's our home.
It is all of ours.
I'm glad there will be a man around to take care of things.
I'll be dropping back from time to time...
...probably just to hole up.
Why don't you stay with us?
Be our partner.
They won't miss you.
Maybe they'll forget you.
You know there ain't no forgetting.
Pa!
Hey, there, Josey!
We're going to Santo Rio!
Lord...
...thanks a lot for bringing us to this place.
Pa and Daniel died...
...at the hands of that low-down, murdering trash out of hell...
...that done them in.
But they put up a good fight and died the best they could.
And thanks a lot for Josey Wales...
...who you changed from a murdering bushwhacker...
...on the side of Satan...
...to a better man...
...in time to deliver us from the Philistines.
And thank you, Lord, for getting us together in Texas.
Are you all right?
Ten Bears...
...he got Travis and Chato.
He'll be riding here in the morning.
If I was looking for a place to hole up, I'd pick this one.
Walls and ceiling, 2 feet thick.
All made out of mud, nothing to burn.
Two doors, front and back, right in sight of one another.
These here crosses are to fire rifles through. Up and down, side to side.
Tom Turner knew what he was doing.
You bet.
I'll be shooting out that door.
I'd rather have you sit right there...
...and do the loading.
Can you do that?
I can.
Moonlight...
...I want you to go to this door.
You fire through here, all right?
Laura Lee, right through this window.
Can you shoot?
I'll try.
Lone, you take this window right over here, and the door.
Where there's the most firing.
You'll have to keep an eye on that hallway there because...
...the only blind spot is the ceiling.
They'll get around to it eventually.
They can't shoot through it, but they might...
...dig a hole in it and drop down, maybe in the back bedroom.
Now remember...
...when things look bad, and it looks like you won't make it...
...then you got to get mean.
I mean plumb, maddog mean!
Because if you lose your head and give up, then you neither live nor win.
That's just the way it is.
Use pistols at short range.
More fire power and less reloading.
Keep this fire going.
Keep an iron on it red-hot.
Anybody gets hit, slap iron to it.
That's the fastest way to stop the blood.
What's all that paint about?
It's my death face.
You know, we're sure going to show them redskins something tomorrow!
No offense meant.
None taken.
Where's he going?
He knows he can do the best for us on the back of a horse.
He's a guerrilla fighter.
He figures he can carry the fight to the enemy.
He's going down into the valley to kill Ten Bears...
...and as many of the men as he can.
How will he do that and come back here?
He won't come back.
You be Ten Bears?
I am Ten Bears.
I'm Josey Wales.
I have heard.
You're the Gray Rider.
You would not make peace with the
Bluecoats. You may go in peace.
I reckon not.
Got nowhere to go.
Then you will die.
I came here to die with you.
Or live with you.
Dying's not hard for you and me.
It's living that's hard...
...when all you ever cared about has been butchered or raped.
Governments don't live together.
People live together.
Governments don't give you a fair word or a fair fight. I've come here to...
...give you either one.
Or get either one from you.
I came here like this so you'll know my word of death is true.
And that my word of life is then true.
The bear lives here, the wolf, the antelope, the Comanche.
And so will we.
We'll only hunt what we need to live on, same as the Comanche does.
And every spring when the Comanche moves north...
...he can rest here in peace...
...butcher some of our cattle and jerk beef for the journey.
The sign of the Comanche, that will be on our lodge.
That's my word of life.
And your word of death?
It's here in my pistols and there in your rifles.
I'm here for either one.
These things you say we will have, we already have.
That's true.
I ain't promising you nothing extra.
I'm just giving you life, and you're giving me life.
And I'm saying men can live together without butchering one another.
It's sad that governments are chiefed by the double-tongues.
There is iron in your words of death for all Comanches to see.
And so there is iron in your words of life.
No signed paper can hold the iron.
It must come from men.
The words of Ten Bears carry the same iron of life and death.
It is good that warriors such as we meet in the struggle of life...
...or death.
It shall be life.
So will it be.
I reckon so.
I'll be damned! Look at this!
Come. Sit down.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you!
Sit down.
I never been so glad to see an Indian.
I've got something to show you,
Mr. Wales.
I made this chain for you.
I braided it from my hair.
That's real nice. It really is.
It's a watch chain.
It's a nice one. It will come in handy.
I thank you for it.
You do have a watch, don't you?
I've been meaning to get one.
Could we...
...play a song for you?
I'm afraid I don't really know too many songs.
Could we play something you like?
Come on.
Only song I can think of is
"Rose of Alabama."
We remember that old piece.
Rosie, come here.
Do you dance?
Me neither.
I could see him through this window when he shot my partner.
He was traveling with an old Injun and a squaw...
...and some old lady and a scrawny girl.
Had to be him. He had this scar right on his face, right here.
I wasn't about to face him down alone.
You men get them horses out of sight.
If Josey Wales comes back here, we'll buy him a drink.
Kansas was all...
...golden and smelled like sunshine.
I always heard there were 3 kinds of suns in Kansas.
Sunshine...
...sunflowers...
...and sons of bitches.
At least that's something.
I heard a joke about Missouri once.
Something about how people from Missouri...
...are always saying, "Show me."
Do you know it?
I think it was:
What does a man from Missouri say...
...if someone asks him to see a
Missouri mule?
He says, "Show me."
Get it?
They teach dumb jokes to pretty girls in Kansas.
They teach other things.
Show me.
Pa!
You're up kind of early, aren't you?
It's been nice riding with you.
Same here.
When you get to town, get some nice dresses for the ladies, you hear?
I will.
Get something specially nice for Laura
Lee for when I come back in the spring.
Or the following spring.
Sometimes trouble just follows a man.
Hell, I've been here way too long as it...
I reckon so.
You're all alone now, Wales.
Not quite alone.
Now we're really going to show these palefaces something!
No offense.
None taken.
These freebooters are a slander to Kansas...
...attacking innocent women like this.
The bullets were flying...
...and people running every which way.
Church bells were ringing.
Me and Miss Rose were ducking for cover.
Because one didn't know where the shots were coming...
Mr. Wilson!
Good morning.
Hello, Mr. Wilson.
We were just telling a little story...
...about an outlaw passed through this way a while back.
I don't suppose you'd know about him but...
These 2 fellows down here is
Texas Rangers.
Been on his trail, along with this other fellow over here.
What did you say your name was, friend?
Fletcher.
That's right, Mr. Fletcher.
Anyway, they've been chasing this outlaw...
...and it just so happens old Ten Spot here knows all about it.
Yes, sir.
It was down in Monterey, Mexico, a little while back.
Anyway, this outlaw fellow...
...he went up against 5 pistoleros.
He got 3 of them before they cut him down.
Is that right, Miss Rose?
That's right. His name was...
...Josey Wales.
Yeah, that's it. Josey Wales.
If that's what happened, then Josey Wales must be dead.
He is dead.
He sure is dead.
Dead, all right.
Will you sign this affidavit?
Sign? I sure will.
That's it.
Nice seeing you, Mr. Wilson.
Must be 5000 lawmen in Texas right now.
Can't get them all.
I guess that's the truth.
You fellows get back up this way, stop in.
I reckon we won't be coming back this way.
I don't believe that story about Josey Wales.
You don't?
No, sir, I don't.
I don't believe no 5 pistoleros could do in Josey Wales.
Maybe it was 6.
Could have even been 10.
I think he's still alive.
Alive? No sir.
I think I'll go down to Mexico to try to find him.
And then?
He's got the first move.
I owe him that.
I'll try to tell him the war is over.
What do you say?
I reckon so.
I guess we all died a little in that damn war.
"SINOLA"
Got some nice breakfast for you, boys.
Hey, Joe!
Wake up and eat something.
You're gonna appear before the Judge.
He's stinking drunk! - Why'd you put him in here? We don't want him!
Gringo son of a bitch woke us up.
He don't give a damn!
Hey Joe, you hear me?
You're to appear before the judge.
Bob Mitchell hit me?
- Yup.
Who else?
- And some others.
Took three of 'em to get you in here last night.
I'll be back for you.
Smells good, eh?
Gringo, you want some?
You say, "Please, Señor Naco."
Say it!
I want to remind you why we're here.
We aren't suing anybody yet.
We're here to see if any of you have a legal claim.
If you do, then a suit will be filed in court.
But I want you to think before you act.
I don't know if the land grants you have, signed by the King of Spain or the Emperor of Mexico, are going to stand up against the deeds and titles on file here.
I do have other court matters to attend to, so I'm postponing these hearings until tomorrow.
I'll let you have time to consider what you're doing.
I advise you to use proof before you take legal action that'll set peoples' teeth on edge.
Calvin? - Yo?
- Gimme Joe Kidd, right now.
Come on, Joe. They're waitin' on you.
Hey, Gringo. Want some?
Go ahead, take it.
You want some?
Calvin, what the Hell's going on?
Boy just spilled his breakfast.
You shouldn't have hit me, Bob.
- Next time I'll knock your head off.
Let's go see the judge.
Your Honor, I got three warrants on Joe Kidd here:
Poaching, disorderly, and resisting arrest.
Poaching? - Witness saw him carrying a buck off Jicarilla Reservation.
You arrested a man for shooting a deer? - I warned him.
What did you do with this deer?
- I ate him.
It's against the law to hunt on a reservation.
The deer didn't know where he was, and I wasn't sure either.
Are you pleading guilty? - I'm saying
I shot a mule deer in South Emenaro.
On the reservation.
Last night I told him he had to pay a fine, and he got nasty.
That's the "disorderly" charge?
- No, Sir.
"Disorderly" was something else.
What?
Well, he stood out there and said he would urinate on the courthouse.
You do whatever you feel like, is that it?
Anything else?
- Yes.
Do you want to pay a 10-dollar fine or spend 10 days in jail?
I'll take the 10 days.
Your Honor...
- Court's adjourned until 2 o'clock.
You think you can sit in that jail while Calvin waits on you? No, Siree!
You're gonna paint, scrub floors and work your...
I want to inform you people, you're in a US territorial court.
We have listened to you enough.
Now, now it's our turn.
When the Anglo first wished to build a house in Sinola, he asked.
And the old people, our grandfathers say, "It's alright.
There is enough land.
Let the Anglo have a home."
Then you build more houses, the railroad, the courthouse.
Then we begin to hear you say strange things.
Two years ago, we start to see about our land claims.
We go to the record office in Santa Fe, and ask for our deeds.
You know what they say?
"No, we don't have those records any more.
There was a fire in the courthouse, and all the records got burnt up."
You feel you have a legal claim, with proof... - We have heard all that!
Ricardo!
We let you use our land, but you wish to steal it all!
Look, Mister...
- I am Luis Chama.
So you're Chama.
Well, you're more trouble than you're worth, but I'll still inform you:
You're committing an offence before a witness in a court of justice.
That is the word:
Justice.
Later we will have much time to talk about it.
What are you staring at?
I just want to remember your face, honey, when you come to trial.
I'll show you something.
Anglos claim they own the land.
Big cattle and timber companies.
One day, there was a fire...
Stay where you are! He's going with us. He'll give us our rights.
What do you want him for? Take
Mitchell. He's an expert on rights.
Think they'll shoot us?
- Maybe. Maybe not.
Luis, he's got the judge!
Who's with him?
- Joe Kidd. He was in jail.
Forget him.
Get the judge!
I suggest you go right on the back, your Honor. - Yeah.
Hello, Joe. How'd you make out?
I'm not sure yet, Harry.
Gringo, you're thirsty, eh?
Where is he? - Oh, he went home.
Your friends are calling you.
I guess I better go.
I guess so.
Maybe we'll see each other in jail again sometime, eh?
That's possible.
Calvin!
Where in Hell you been?
They broke those two guys outta jail!
- I said where in Hell you been?
Where?
- In jail.
Jesus! Form a posse!
Mount up! Git your guns!
Jesus...
I'll take the posse out, you stay here.
Will you try to keep some law and order while I'm gone?
Bob, how we gonna find them?
- Didn't they just leave fresh tracks?
There's tracks all over out there.
How do we know which are Chama's?
He gets up in them mountains, he can stay up there for good.
Just a damn minute!
I'm not beggin' you to come.
You want to sit on your fat asses when that wild son of a bitch is loose, you don't mind him cutting fences and running your stock... that's OK!
But get out of my way, I'm riding!
And I'm going to bring back him or his hide!
Joe, what are you doing?
Serving 10 days.
Bob, you know
Joe's the one we need.
You want to go?
No. I got nothing against Luis Chama.
Posse couldn't get him.
You think that's gonna work?
Joe, you take your broom, that shovel, that rake and that bucket.
Go to courthouse square and pick up everything that's not nailed down.
Howdy, Mr. Harlan. - Howdy.
To the Grand Hotel. - You bet.
Good morning, Mr. Harlan.
These telegrams came in last night and this morning.
One of them, I noticed, all the way from Chicago.
Mr. Harlan, it's such a pleasure to have you and your friends.
It's been how long? 2, 3 months?
Time goes so fast.
Seems like yesterday. Oh my, no.
I'm glad you weren't here yesterday.
You heard about the excitement we had.
I've reserved the governor's suite for you, and 2 other rooms. Anything else?
Mr. Harlan?
I want the whole second floor.
Oh, I have guests... the other rooms...
I mean, I don't have extra space anywhere.
What should I do?
I can't very well tell them to get up and get out, can I?
For 10 bucks a head,
I'll throw 'em out the window.
Just say the rooms are spoken for, and there's nothing you can do.
If there's trouble, gimme a holler.
- Just say the rooms are spoken for.
Send it out for me.
- Hello, Mr. Harlan. Ma'am.
Anything I can do for you?
- I want to see a man named Joe Kidd.
Joe Kidd's in jail. - If he weren't,
I doubt we'd be talking.
You knew he was in jail, huh?
I'd like to pay his fine, and I want you to send him over to me.
Didn't know he was a friend of yours.
- Send him on over. Second Floor.
Joe, Mr. Harlan wants to see you.
Who? - Mr. Harlan.
- Don't know the man.
You know his name?
- Never heard it.
He knows you, he's paid your fine, and he wants to see you.
Yeah? Where is he?
- At the hotel.
He's paid my fine, huh?
He can't be all bad.
You Joe Kidd? - Yeah.
- Be with you in a minute.
Hey, aren't you going to wait?
Well, you sure don't look like you're supposed to.
How am I supposed to look?
- You're dressed like a town dude.
Were you really leaving?
Well, he asked to see me.
If he's busy, maybe another time.
Oh, you don't know
Mr. Harlan, do you?
You call him that?
"Mr. Harlan"?
I call him "Frank".
A few other things. Why?
Well, you... don't look like his daughter,
I don't think you're his wife.
I'm not his mother either.
But you do take care of him at times.
Ask him if you like.
- Or I'll find out for myself.
How long did they have you locked up?
- Two days.
What would you be like after two months?
We wouldn't even be talking now.
Mr. Harlan can see you now.
Mr. Harlan, Joe Kidd.
Kidd, Joe Kidd.
I'll say this:
You come well recommended.
Judge Vince Brennan, spoke very highly of you.
A man named Wallace said you worked at the Jicarilla Apache Station, know the mountains and game trails better than anybody.
You were supplying their meat.
Yeah, I worked for them a few years.
I understand you hunted men.
Anybody with a price on his head.
Good at it.
That was a long time ago.
Now you got an outfit in Big Wash, you work when you're not out hunting.
I get out now and then.
We propose to spend a week, maybe 10 days.
Pay you your rate, and a bonus for everything we shoot.
Get us some mule deer, some elk, maybe a mountain cat if we see one.
You think this piece of iron will stop one of them big old cats?
Yeah, if you can get close enough.
Close enough. Hear that, Mingo?
Mr. Kidd, meet my associates:
Mr. Olin Mingo, Lamarr Simms, this is Roy Gannon.
These gentlemen are fine hunters, my friend.
I bet them against anybody, at any distance.
You believe that?
If he says so...
Whatever he says, that's it.
I'll show you something, buddy.
Shut the window, Lamarr.
We'll need four horses, which we'll buy off you if you want.
Come to your place tomorrow evening, and start in the morning.
You're asking me to guide for you?
What do you think
I been talking about all this time?
Well, I don't hire out to guide, either for animals or men.
You don't believe we're after deer, do you? - You're after Luis Chama.
Seen through it right away, didn't you? Got a keen eye.
It's simple enough. You deal in land, and he wants to take it away.
If the sheriff can't stop him,
I will, Mister.
I got claim to 935 sections, nearly 600,000 acres.
And I'm not letting some sheepherder named Luis Chama cut my fences and stir up the Mexican population with talk about land reform.
Nor am I going to waste time arguing in court.
Now here it is:
I'll give you 500 dollars to help us track that man.
If it's your shot that gets him, it's alright with me.
500 dollars. What do you say?
I already said it.
Wait a minute, Sir. I paid a fine on you. Got you out of jail.
If you want your 10 dollars back,
I'll sit out the rest of the time.
He's going on a hunting trip.
I'll be back.
Emilio?
Vita?
Joseph!
Señor Emilio, they take him!
They take horses too!
When did it happen? Where?
- This morning.
Emilio say, "stay home," and they take him. Up there!
Joseph, where you been?
Chama do this? - He and his men took some horses and shot the rest.
One say you killed his friend.
He say he's gonna kill you too.
Where are you going?
Come in.
You want Luis Chama? - Got thinking about the money, did you?
Do you want him? - I told you: 500, and I don't care who shoots him.
The price'll be a thousand.
Alright. Anything else?
No. Meet you downstairs.
Want something?
You know how many holes
I could put in you with this gun?
Lamarr,
I got a dollar that says I can break your neck before you shoot.
Yeah. Mr. Harlan wants you around.
That's why
I don't plug you right now.
When Mr. Harlan doesn't want me around any more, you let me know. Huh, boy?
We might get lucky and find him sittin' home waiting on us, Mingo.
Yeah: "For a dumb-ass sheep-dipper, you sure been bothering us.
Causing all kinds of discomfort."
There's a road west of here. We could save time.
Game doesn't walk down roads.
We're supposed to be hunting deer.
If we see somebody here, which don't seem likely, does it?
Well, we've had company for about a mile. - Where at?
Both sides of us.
I don't see a thing. How many?
Three, maybe more.
- What's going on? - Shut up.
We got people going with us, maybe Chama. - I don't see anybody.
I see 'em, Frank.
- What are you saying?
I could wing one of those fellows, if you wanted to talk to him.
They're showing themselves.
They don't give a darn.
They know they got us outnumbered.
Nice looking string you have there.
- Still green. They'll be alright.
You rope 'em? - Yeah.
We chased them three or four days.
You haven't, by chance, see any elk around?
No. Some deer.
You out hunting, eh?
You haven't been home for a while?
No, not for a few days.
You want some game? Go into san Juan. You might get a bear.
My friend, I'll ask a question, and I want to ask it only once:
Where's Luis Chama?
Luis Chama? Yeah, I saw him some time. You looking for him?
We got to go. If I see Luis Chama,
I'll tell him you're asking for him.
Mingo, I want him alive.
I got him in the arm. I was aiming for his shoulder, but he jumped.
You say you saw Luis Chama where?
I don't know anybody by that name.
- We can cut your ears off.
I don't know him.
We can cut something else off too.
He says, "Say anything.
Why get chopped up?"
Chico, the only way you're going to live is if you answer me.
Understand?
The question is:
Where's Luis Chama?
I don't know him!
Lamarr!
I came here to hunt Chama, not kill people in cold blood.
I told you, I don't have time for court hearings.
If they want to fight me,
I'll blow 'em straight to Hell.
Anybody home?
Hello. Well, look what I have found!
Evenin'.
Honey, I want to ask you something.
You know a man named Luis Chama?
I know him.
- You see him lately? - No.
When?
About a week ago.
- Are you a friend of his?
I see him when he goes by here.
- Like on his way to Arroyo Blanco?
You know where that is.
- Over the pass. He isn't there.
Well Honey, we're friends of his.
If he's around, we want to say hello.
Is that why you have all those guns?
This is a hunting trip.
You gotta have guns.
Ask why she has so many guns. Huh?
- They're from my father and brother.
Where are they? - Looking for work.
I don't know when they come back.
They leave you by yourself?
I don't mind being alone a few days.
Pretty girl like you shouldn't be left alone.
Maybe we'll camp here tonight, if she invites us.
What's your name, Honey?
- Helen Sanchez.
Helen, what would you think if we stayed here with you tonight?
I think you're going to do whatever you want.
They'd like some more coffee.
Have you told them yet?
- Nope.
Why not?
I think it's none of there business.
But you are with them.
- Let's say I made a poor judgment, but I'm gonna have to live with it.
When I was in jail in town, there was a man named Naco?
He died two days ago.
- He shouldn't have come at me.
But you want Chama.
Everybody wants Chama.
He'll either get shot or hanged.
Some people will give their lives for what they believe. You understand.
I guess so, if they want something enough.
No. Even if there's no chance, but to do it for others.
Like a soldier gives his life.
You don't know Luis Chama.
Maybe you've never met anybody like him. - Maybe not.
Were you with him when he came to my place?
Yes, I was there.
You want to kill me too?
There was a man named Emilio with my horses. - I remember him.
Ramón went back to see if he was following us.
Ramón, huh?
Next stop: Bandera Station.
Nothin' there but stock pens.
- Wanna bet?
Mr. Harlan, where you been?
- Resting from my train ride.
Thought you'd be here waiting.
- We're here now, Eljay.
Let's go. We're ready.
All those guns to kill one man.
Yeah, if they find him.
They're all hidin'.
Call everybody out into the street.
Alright, everybody out!
Out in the street!
Hold your fire!
They're way up in those rocks.
Chama!
You hit one of my men,
I'll kill 10 of your people!
Morning, Padre.
I want you to call your people out.
We're holding services in the street.
Bring them out! Out in the street!
Roy?
Now,
I don't want to take up your time.
I just want to say, we're gonna shoot five of you, if Luis Chama don't come down off his mountain by sun-up tomorrow!
If he don't show by noon, we shoot five more.
If he still don't show up by supper, we put five more against the wall.
Now, the next day if we have to, we start all over again.
Son...
You have a horse?
- Yes.
Get on your horse, go upstairs and ask Luis Chama if he heard what I said.
Understand?
- Yes, Señor.
Padre, get 'em all inside the church.
Repeat everything, in case some of 'em "Americans" didn't understand.
Stake out your men, Eljay.
Keep the horses saddled.
Me and the little girl sleep here.
Kidd, you're fired.
Take his gun, Mingo.
Put him in the church.
Look at him. Without his gun, he looks like a big, dumb farmboy.
Go ahead, farmboy.
Take your pick.
I know it's a crappy deal, buddy.
But that's all you got.
What's the matter, run out of nerve?
Go ahead.
Grab.
'Cause I'm gonna blow your head off!
I said make a grab.
Jesus, that boy don't ever learn.
Well, the fun's over and he's gone to church.
Are you thirsty?
Yeah. What do you have there?
- Holy water.
I've had just about everything else, might as well have some holy water.
Today is the feast of Saint James the Apostle, one of the first martyrs.
I will tell the people: Pray to him, for his strength. He was beheaded, rather than deny his faith.
You wouldn't have a gun around here, Padre?
Good time of day, Eljay.
Day's work is done, a man's waitin' on a good supper.
Open the door, Ming.
You going to feed these people?
- Feed them.
Roy, let him get these people some food.
Hey, Lamarr, how you feelin'?
That medicine easing the pain?
You just keep talking.
You'll be spitting teeth all night.
A high-priced waiter you got, Roy.
You gonna eat all that?
- It's for the glutton outside.
How's he treating you? - We're getting married, what do you think?
He wouldn't have a loaded gun around here, would he?
Don't do anything foolish.
Wait for Luis.
The boy they sent seems to be having trouble finding his way back.
He's probably still hunting for Chama.
- Think so?
Luis is up there.
He knows and he'll come.
With a gun, without one, but he'll come.
I certainly hope so.
If he doesn't, it'll disappoint an awful lot of people.
If you don't blink soon, your eyeballs will fall out.
Hey! How about somebody else comin' up here for a while?
You want to take that, Lamarr?
Why not.
Come on, Lamarr. Get up here.
When this is over, we finish it.
From the table they put the guns on.
I don't even know if it fires.
Don't worry, it fires.
I have lived with my people 33 years.
This morning
I can't look in their faces.
I can't bless five of them and send them outside.
Well, Padre... we'll see.
He's dead. - I believe you.
Send up his gun and his hat.
Lamarr, don't fall asleep up there!
Go screw yourself.
That sweet boy's either asleep or he's fallen off the tower.
Oh, let him alone.
He's had a bad night.
OK, get five of them out. Come on!
I want Chama to see the facts of life starin' him in the face.
Roy, Mingo!
Get outta the field, get your rifles and do some good. Come on!
There they are, Chama!
You coming down now?
Chama, you got one minute!
Now, that's not much of a shot for you is it, Mingo?
Where do I hit them?
- I'll pick a spot.
First man: Second button.
For six bits, if you hit the button.
For six bits, I'll hit the second button on both men.
Jesus...
Mingo! Shoot two right now!
How you doing?
- Don't touch it.
You would have let them kill those people!
I'm going to tell you something.
Listen, and try to understand.
If our people are killed for what we are doing, they will become names.
They will live forever.
Martyrs?
I think we have enough of them!
Then why do you want me to become one?
Listen: We only win if I stay alive.
If those men kill me now, who will take my place?
Understand?
You'd let people die for you.
- For what they believe.
They believe in you!
I am telling you how it is.
There is no other way.
- I know another way.
Come with me back to Sinola, give yourself up and stand trial.
Stay out of it. - You brought me into it by stealing my horses!
You killed one of our men.
You help her, now we're even.
Go home, while you can.
He's right! We must give ourselves up.
Don't you see? There's no other way!
I don't care what you think.
I take you along for cold nights, and days when there's nothing to do, not to hear you talk.
Harlan!
You want Chama?
You can find him in Sinola Jail.
Let's mount up.
Just like that, huh?
Straight up or draped over the saddle.
Either one.
And my men?
I don't care about them. They can come or stay, whatever pleases them.
Listen to this Anglo son of a bitch!
Luis. Say it.
We throw him off the cliff.
Ramón. Alright. This isn't the time.
We'll settle this later.
Train stop here, Mr. Harlan?
- It'll stop, Eljay.
Hold your fire!
They're way out of range.
We'll be eleven.
Hi!
- Hey, little girl!
Let a person get a chance to breathe.
- You'll breathe so you can't stop.
Did you miss me?
- Of course I did!
Stay right here in the room, like I told you? - Sure did.
Mr. Harlan. Ma'am.
How was your hunting trip?
Mitchell, how you been?
- Just fine.
Somebody will bring Luis Chama in tomorrow. Hand him over to me.
What did you say? - Hand him over to me. - There's no way...
Take time off and get drunk. - Mr. Harlan...
Tomorrow's Sunday. Pray we don't meet again until this is done.
Little girl, find some whiskey and pour me a drink.
Morning.
Let's open up. - We're Closed.
- You're open.
We're open.
Alright. I say Chama goes to jail and pleads his case. What do you say?
Not you, Ramón.
Ramón!
Lead on.
I figured we might be too close.
Come on in, Kidd.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Hey, Kidd! Bring Chama over here.
Come on in, Kidd!
Mitchell! Got a prisoner for you.
Jesus, Joe! - Here. Give me some cover. Start with the hotel.
Bob!
Get outta here.
Good luck, huh?
Well, that settles that.
Anything I can do for you?
Come on.
Joe, you shouldn't have done that.
Next time,
I'll knock your damned head off.
His name was Jeremiah Johnson.
They say he wanted to be a mountain man.
The story goes that he was a man of proper wit and adventurous spirit... suited to the mountains.
Nobody knows where he came from, and it don't seem to matter much.
He was a young man... and ghosty stories about the tall hills didn't scare him none.
He was looking for e Hewkin gun,
50 caliber or better.
He settled for e 30, but damn, it was e genuine Hewkin.
You couldn't do no better.
Bought a horse, traps and other truck that went with being a mountain man.
And said goodbye to whatever life was down below.
Where is it I could find bear, beaver, other critters worth cash skinned?
Ride due west as the sun sets.
Turn left at the Rocky Mountains.
This here 's his story.
"I, Hatchet Jack..." being of sound mind and broken legs... do hereby leaveth my bear rifle... to whatever finds it.
Lord hope it be a white man.
It is a good rifle... and killed the bear that killed me.
Anyway, I am dead.
"Yours truly, Hatchet Jack."
Ha, ha!
A 50 caliber Hawkin!
Come on, you.
That'll be far enough, pilgrim!
Where are you?
You're a fine target, pilgrim!
Empty your hand.
I ain't seen no live man in 2 months.
I am Bear Claw Chris Lapp.
Blood kin to the grizzly that bit Jim Bridger's ass!
You are molesting my hunt!
- I am...
- I know who you are!
You're the same dumb pilgrim
I've been hearing for 20 days... and smelling for 3!
How come you ain't been scalped?
Ain't been too lucky?
- No.
- This place has been trapped out since '25.
Why are you here?
I hunt griz.
- Griz?
- Grizzly bears, pilgrim. I collect the claws.
I had one in that thicket.
Ready to shake hands, until you came!
I'm sorry, then.
You look it!
Hungry too?
Come on.
You know how to skin griz?
I can skin most anything.
You sure are cocky for a starving pilgrim.
There she be. Go in, get warm, eat something.
I've got a chore to finish.
My boy!
Are you sure that you can skin griz?
Just as fast as you can find them.
Jesus!
Skin that one, pilgrim, and I'll get you another!
Must have missed another war down there.
Didn't miss nothing.
If I head due west tomorrow, will I find places to trap?
If you head due west or any place tomorrow, you'll be starving in a week.
You ain't likely to meet someone like me.
Mountain's got its own ways.
What?
Use that skin pad, pilgrim, before you lose all your fingers.
What you learned down in the flat will serve you no good up here.
You got some work to do.
Utes and Flatheads... are generally peaceful critters.
Crows, they are fearful.
Mighty warriors too.
In my opinion, the Crows are the handsomest Indians there is.
And proud too.
There ain't a man alive can match them on a horse.
I've seen them ride with one foot on the horse's rump... one wrist through a loop in the mane... shooting arrows and guns under the horse's neck!
But they are an adulterous people.
Adulterous.
Here you are, pilgrim.
Sharp enough to scale a fish with.
Ever get lonesome?
For what?
Woman?
Full-time night woman?
I never could find no tracks in a woman's heart.
I packed a Squaw for 10 years, pilgrim.
Cheyenne, she was.
And the meanest bitch that ever balled for beads!
I lodgepoled her at Dead Wolf Creek and traded her for a Hawkin gun!
Don't get me wrong,
I love the women, I surely do!
But I swear... a woman's breast is the hardest rock... the Almighty ever made on Earth... and I can find no sign on it.
Now these coals here will simmer until sunrise.
You better go do likewise.
Didn't put enough dirt down.
Saw it right off.
You track well, pilgrim.
- Kind of like it, don't you?
- Maybe.
Figures. A human man... likes tracking and killing.
An Injun, he figures it's natural.
Wind's right.
But he'll just run, soon as we step out of these trees.
Trick to it.
Walk out on this side of your horse.
What if he sees our feet?
Elk don't know how many feet a horse has.
No, you damn fool!
Slide it up over the saddle!
You got him, pilgrim!
You nailed him clean.
We got us an elk to skin!
Can't figure people there eating hog when they could feed on elk.
Didn't like it down there?
- Ought to have been different.
- Is that so?
Many a child journeys this high to be different.
To get from here what their natures couldn't get them below.
It comes to nothing.
Can't cheat the mountain, pilgrim.
Mountain got it...
Probably Crow. They'll steal our horses unless we bribe them.
Why?
It's their territory.
They figure we're trespassing.
Yep, Crow.
Paints-His-Shirt-Red.
That's his sign. Just stand still.
You two know each other?
I saw him once.
He says you fish poorly.
You understand their language?
Paints-His-Shirt speaks English, he just does this to aggravate me.
Says he's got enough bear claws.
Hold that.
What's your name?
Johnson.
Your Christian name?
Jeremiah.
You've learned well, pilgrim.
You'll go far.
Providing you ain't burnt alive or scalped.
I will do my best.
You can out wood and leave it up on the Judith.
Riverboat captains will leave you gold if you put out a pouch.
Good thing to know... if times get hard.
Watch your topknot.
Yes. Watch yours.
I told you not to go play outside.
You got yourself all dirty... and also, young lady... without your shoes.
And you, Josh... dirty!
Look at you! There, now!
Mary Lou, you knew better than to go out in the sun...
Have I told you not to go out... without a bonnet on your head?
You better stop there.
Woman, I am your friend.
We have graves to dig.
You were borne on the wind today.
Josh was being a bad boy.
I must tell your father.
Time to start the garden.
If the wind would stop.
We will now sing.
Shall we gather at the river
Where bright angel feet have trod
With its crystal tide forever
Flowing by the throne of God
Yes, we'll gather at the river
The beautiful, the beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God
Boy, did you see all this?
Better get one of these biscuits, boy.
I make damn good biscuits.
Here's food.
I could not find your husband anywhere, ma'am.
So, maybe he will come back here.
The Indians will not bother you now, on account of... you are touched.
They will be afraid.
What about the boy?
Maybe you and the boy best come with me now.
I will take you down to the Judith.
Put you on a ferry.
Take him.
- What?
- Take him!
Ma'am, I wouldn't know how to tend after...
You got a name, boy?
Huh?
I will call you Caleb.
It is a name
I have always admired.
You like that? Caleb?
Do what you like.
I was much the same myself.
Damn!
Are you all right?
Sure, I got a fine horse under me!
Got one of them feathers in my nose.
Keep sneezing, it'll come out all right.
Haven't seen anyone pass by recently, have you?
Nobody's gone in front of me.
Can't say what's happened behind me though.
The Injuns put you here?
It weren't Mormons.
A chief, name of Mad Wolf.
Nice fellow, don't talk a hell of a lot.
You wouldn't have an extra hat on you, would you?
Shade's getting scarce in these parts.
Why did you shave your head?
Mad Wolf figures like every other Injun I know.
Says this scalp ain't fit for no decent man's lodgepole.
Ain't the first time I protected my head in such a way.
Name's Del Gue.
With an "E."
- When did they come through?
- A few hours ago.
I will be happy to see my horse.
I hate walking.
I knew you would help me get my pelts back.
I wouldn't leave a man without a horse or gun.
Ain't that Hatchet Jack's rifle?
Yeah.
How did you get it?
I found him, froze to a tree.
Damn!
That Hatchet Jack was a wild one.
He was living with a female panther.
Two years in a cave up in the Musselshell.
She never did get used to him.
That be them.
- How many you figure?
- Three.
Just like before.
Are you smelling them Blackfeet?
No, I'm locating my horse.
Dirtiest animal this side of hell.
Come dark, you give me your pistol.
Load that bear rifle full of nails.
No. I got no truck with them Blackfeet.
I plan to be here a long time.
I do not want them down on me.
Them critters hammered me into the ground. Took my rifle, horse.
Stole my pelts. Not to mention what they done to that boy's folks!
Then let it pass?
Nope.
But they'll be asleep soon.
Should be no trouble to slip in there and then get your possibles.
Use this blanket, boy.
To keep you warm.
He don't say a lot, does he?
No.
Hey.
No.
No.
Stay here with the animals.
No!
I am Del Gue!
I can whip my weight in Wolverines... straight through a crab apple orchard on a flash of lightning!
You've stolen my pelts!
And die, you must!
You skinheaded son of a bitch, you almost got me killed!
Where are you going?
Don't you want any of these?
What?
Scalps!
No.
Mother Gue never raised such a foolish child.
Stop that, boy.
- What do you do with the scalps?
- Sell them to the English.
English?
London is wallpapered with Injun scalps.
- Let's pull into those trees.
- Don't go getting hasty.
Them is Flatheads, and they've hurt nobody that I know.
Just hold back.
- What's he saying?
- Says they're Blackfeet ponies.
He asks if you are the great warrior... who avenges the Crazy Woman in the Wolf Tail Valley.
She's big medicine.
And so are you, if you are that man.
- So what's he shouting for?
- Scared of you.
- But how did you...?
- I didn't know they'd be Flatheads.
It's all right, boy.
Chief here is named
Two-Tongues Lebeaux.
Mighty educated too.
French missionaries taught him their language.
- Christian Indians?
- Lots of them.
He says the scalps are fierce and the horses are fleet.
Take them.
Take them. And the ponies.
I have no further use for them.
Damn fool, you may have cooked our brains!
Why?
He brought us here to honor you and you want to give him a gift.
If he cannot give you a better one, it'll be an insult.
What's so funny?
The danger is over.
He has thought of a better gift.
- His daughter.
- Huh?
Now you have a son, you need a wife.
- I don't want no wife...
- He says he'll be very happy.
What is that word? Oh, yes!
He may read the Bible, but he's still an Injun.
And his rules is his rules.
If you value your hair, you will get married!
Del Gue,
I do not think this is funny.
It ain't.
When you leave, you can take her to Fort Hawley and sell her.
But you best take her, friend.
Besides, maybe she ain't near bad.
He says she's called The Swan, but she'll answer to anything you want.
But maybe you need her.
You turn down this gift, they'll slit you, me, Caleb and the horses... from crotch to eyeball with a dull deer antler!
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
Mrs. Johnson.
Your husband has told me so much about you.
Congratulations, Two-Tongues.
Wonderful wedding.
- Bye, Jeremiah Johnson!
- Where are you going?
I wouldn't want to disturb your wedding night.
I'll see you in the fall.
Have a nice honeymoon,
Mrs. Johnson.
Do you speak any English?
I don't speak any Flathead.
So don't bother me, neither of you!
Wondering about something?
Go ahead, ask.
Leave it be.
Nothing wrong with quiet.
Cooking sure don't smell like Bear Claw's.
Tie him off, boy.
Suppertime!
Go on, boy, and eat.
It's good for you.
No.
I'm full.
You religious too?
Religious.
I'm not going to harm you.
Religious.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm not going to harm you.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
Yes.
Ain't that a lot easier than saying all that gibberish?
Yes!
Great hunter.
Yes.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Fine figure of a man, yes?
Yes?
- Yes.
- That is all you need to know. For now.
You getting enough, boy?
Yes.
This wasn't my idea, you know?
Lord!
ThiS'll do.
River in front, cliffs behind.
Good water. Not much wind.
This will be a good place to live.
Hawk.
Yeah. Going for the Musselshell.
It'd take me a week's riding.
And he'll be there in...
Hell, he's there already.
I wish you would see fit to stop the practicing of these ceremonies.
NO!
Caleb, take notice of the traps and go fetch some proper food.
And keep your nose open, there may be Indians about.
Be going for buffalo soon.
No, you'll stay here.
Here. Go on, fetch the rest of that wood.
Ch.
Swan, I cannot stand this weight.
Well...
It will have to do.
Johnson.
It will keep me warm in the strong wind.
And the rain will not pass through neither.
Thank you.
You have beaver scent?
What happened to your face?
Huh? My beard?
Watch this.
Spring.
There.
Careful, that'll take your hand off.
Put that smell down.
Won't come around without the smell.
Hell, don't run off. It's me.
What?
Skin this.
Troop, halt!
Johnson?
I'm Lieutenant Mulvey,
Third Cavalry.
That's Reverend Lindquist.
We've been watched since we started to climb up from the Gila.
Who are they, Flathead?
I said, are they Flathead?
- Did I say something?
- No.
It's been a long time... since I had... so much of the English language spoke at me.
I ain't used to it.
Crow.
This is Crow land.
This is the Department of Colorado.
- Yeah.
- You're on good terms with them.
Crow?
Who gave you that idea?
People talk about it down below.
You live up here.
I do that.
And you know the high country.
Do you know Feather Mesa?
I do. So?
We have wagons there. Three of them.
Broke down in the snow and ice.
We got to get them out of there before they freeze.
Gr the Indians get them.
Would be wise.
We were told that you would know how to get there.
Through those passes.
We were hoping that maybe...
These are Christian families.
Christian women and children, starving.
Do you mean that you intend to let those people die?
How's the war going?
Which war?
One against the President of Mexico.
It's over.
Who won?
Did you hear something?
Can't go through here.
Why not?
Crow burial ground. Sacred.
- We'll have to turn around and head east.
- How far east?
Next pass.
Twenty... 20 miles or so.
Those people are waiting for us!
They're freezing, hungry and scared.
Crow only come with medicine men and burying parties!
- We are not Crows!
- What would happen?
I don't know.
I don't know.
This is big medicine.
They guard it with spirits.
You don't believe that.
It doesn't matter. They do.
You've been up here too long, believing in this!
What chance would I have finding a way through, just by riding west?
Poor chance. Or none.
Thanks all the same, Johnson, but we're riding through.
Sergeant! Prepare to move!
You won't make it.
You have to hunt, you said.
I have to try.
Tell your men to keep behind me in single file.
Tell them to go slow and stay quiet.
- Sergeant!
- Sir.
Single file, slowly.
Yes, sir.
Keep them quiet.
Well, we seem to have escaped.
How long have you been carrying your Squaw?
- Thank you...
- Move them fast.
Crow don't take kindly to trespassing.
Where's your mule that kicks holes in the sky and shakes off its saddle?
Where's your slavering wolf of the rolling prairie?
Here's your old grizzer brown bear can clobber bark off a gum tree.
There's a man for you,
Jeremiah Johnson.
I'm half horse, half gator, and a touch of the earthquake.
I got the prettiest gal, fastest horse... ugliest dog this side of hell.
I can outjump, outrun, throw down... drag out and whip any man in all Kentucky.
How you been, Jeremiah?
Staying alive, Del.
Ain't that hair I see on your head?
It sure is.
I've decided that when I depart from this life, I'd leave something.
At least to be remembered on some man's lodgepole.
Sound wisdom.
- Where you headed?
- Same place you are, Jeremiah.
Hell in the end.
With all them Injuns after you,
I cannot brag about your campsite.
You got old and scary since you growed hair on your head?
What ever happened to that boy?
The one that didn't talk much?
Never did take him to Hawley.
Stayed with that Injun gal all this time?
She wasn't no trouble.
Just like this, one at a time?
You're lucky they were Crows.
Apaches would send 50 at once.
Amongst Injuns... a tribe's greatness is figured on how mighty its enemies be.
Maybe...
Maybe you'd best go down to a town... get out of these mountains.
I've been to a town, Del.
Which way now?
Don't know.
I hear the Big Belt in the Blue has beavers the size of bobcats.
That so?
I ain't never trapped either... but sure would like to.
- Jeremiah-
- You will do well, Del.
You will do well.
If you don't get in too much trouble with all that hair.
Ain't this something?
I told my pap and mam
I was coming to the mountains... to trap and be a mountain man.
Acted like they was gut-shot.
Says: "Son..." make your life go here.
Here's where the people is.
"Them mountains is for animals and savages!"
I said: "Mother Gue..." the Rocky Mountains is the marrow of the world."
And by God, I was right.
Yes, you were.
Which way you headed, Jeremiah?
Canada, maybe.
I hear there's land there a man has never seen.
Keep your nose in the wind... your eyes along the skyline.
I will do that, Del Gue.
I ain't never seen them, but my common sense tells me... the Andes is foothills, and the Alps is for children to climb.
Keep good care of your hair!
These here are
God's finest sculpturings... and there ain't no laws for the brave ones!
And there ain't no asylums for the crazy ones!
And there ain't no churches except this right here.
And there ain't no priests... excepting the birds!
I are a mountain man! And I'll live until an arrow or bullet finds me.
And then I'll leave my bones... on this great map of the magnificent...
Right here, mister.
Where's the crazy woman?
She's gone.
Walk over this way.
Gone where?
Dead.
One of them mounds.
Who are you?
My name's Qualen.
I'm a settler.
Settler.
What are you going to do?
I do it when Indians are coming.
You're him.
Ain't you him?
What's this?
It's for you.
If you be Johnson.
A might early, ain't they?
It ain't a grave like the other.
More like a statue or a monument.
We never see them.
We never even hear them.
We look and there's e new piece of bone or hide, or somethings been left.
So we know they've been here.
Some say you're dead on account of this.
Others say you never will be on account of this.
It won't save anything.
Huh?
Sending them out to hide in the corncrib.
What's on the spit?
Grown particular?
Not about feeding.
Just the company I keep.
Thank you kindly.
You've come far, pilgrim.
Feels like far.
Was it worth the trouble?
What trouble?
You cook good rabbit, pilgrim.
Cold up here.
- What brings you up so high?
- Griz.
Griz.
Avalanche took the cabin.
Lost my mule.
We swum out of it.
But no matter.
Weren't no griz left anyway.
Would you happen to know what month of the year it is?
No, I truly wouldn't.
I'm sorry, pilgrim.
March.
Maybe April.
March, maybe.
I don't believe April.
Winter's a long time going?
Yeah.
Stays long this high.
March is a green, muddy month down below.
Some folks like it.
Farmers mostly.
You have done well to keep so much hair... when so many are after it.
I hope you will fare well.
Let's go, buster.
Beer.
And a bottle.
Ain't much good.
It's all there is.
Will you want anything else?
Just a peaceful hour to drink it in.
Flea-bitten range bums don't usually stop in Lago.
Life here's a little too quick for them.
Maybe you think you're fast enough to keep up with us, huh?
A lot faster than you'll ever live to be.
Yes, sir?
Shave and a hot bath?
That'll be 90 cents.
Cash.
Well, what I mean to say is that the 90 cents usually comes first.
But, hell, it don't really matter.
Before or after, what's the diff?
Sir.
Eau de lilac's only 10 cents more.
Lilac water. Oh, the ladies love it.
Shall we make it an even dollar? No.
Yes.
Moses.
Right you are, gentlemen.
Be right with you.
Just have a chair.
What, you don't like our company?
What's the matter with you?
I'm speaking to you, pig shit.
I think he's got some of that pig shit in his ear.
I don't know which smells worse, him or the shit in the bottle.
What did you say your name was again?
I didn't.
No. I guess you didn't at that, did you?
Why don't you watch where you're going?
Look at this. It's ruined.
There's no need for all that.
All what?
If you want to get acquainted, why don't you just say so?
Acquainted?
Why, you'd be amusing if you weren't so pathetic.
Just a minute.
I'm not finished with you yet.
You know, at a distance, you'd almost pass for a man.
But you're certainly a disappointment up close, aren't you?
To your feet, ma'am.
They're almost as big as your mouth.
You know what you are?
Just trash.
A bottle of whiskey for courage and the manners of a goat.
You're the one who could use a lesson in manners.
Not from you, whiskey breath.
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let go of me!
Let go of me, you! Put me down!
Help me!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
My horse.
A room.
Would you like to register, please, sir?
Somebody, please help me.
Damn you all to hell.
- Good morning. Sleep well?
- Yeah.
Say, are you planning to stay, keep your room another night?
I'll let you know.
All right, anything you say.
Morning.
I've still got a bath coming.
Nice hot bath coming right up.
Yes, sir.
Mordecai, you put some more hot water in that tub there.
This gentleman wants a bath.
You can hang your clothes right down there on the peg.
Now, Miss Peekins does a nice...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Right this way, Captain, sir.
Unless you want Mordecai to take them out and get them laundered while you're soaking.
Miss Peekins does a right clean boiled wash.
Uses lye for pants rabbits, she does.
No itch, no scratch.
Well, pour the water, Mordecai, before it gets cold.
We want the gentleman to be comfortable.
Well, I've been wanting to talk to you.
I might as well get this stool here and set right down and do it, right?
If that's all right with you, huh?
Well, what's it about is Billy Borders.
Don't know the man.
Well, you missed your chance,
'cause you shot him yesterday.
Him and Ike Sharp and Fred Morris.
You know, those are just the names, in case you're interested.
Well, I'm not really interested, Sheriff.
Well, I can't say I blame you, you know.
Billy, he wasn't a loved man, no.
And he didn't have much personality.
What he did have was all bad, just bad.
What you're trying to say is there's no charge, right?
Well, forgive and forget, you know.
That's our motto.
You dirty bastard!
I'll kill you!
Damn it, Callie!
Callie, damn it!
Let go of me, you fat lug!
Stop...
Tell him I'd appreciate it if he doesn't leave town until I talk to him.
Goddamn it!
I'll kill you!
I wonder what took her so long to get mad.
Because maybe you didn't go back for more.
It don't seem to me that we got a choice.
Seeing we got no time to send for help, and further seeing that our sheriff's about as much use as tits on a boar.
Sorry I'm late. Anything happen?
No, no, His Honor's had the floor.
In case you haven't heard it yet,
Stacey Bridges and the Carlin brothers are due to get out of jail today.
They coming here?
That's been their plan, according to all reports.
There's no reason to believe they've changed it.
Possibly they've repented their ways.
Preacher, they're gonna burn this town to the ground and you know it.
What we're talking about now is a way to stop them.
We gotta find that way now and quick.
Nevertheless, my conscience will not allow me to be a party to the hiring of a professional gunfighter.
Well, maybe you'd like to go out there and stand them off yourself, Preacher.
I'm just a simple man of God.
Well, it's time we unsimplified you, Reverend.
Now, Borders, Morris and Short were professional gunfighters on the payroll of the Lago Mining Company to protect our interests and the interests of this town, which are identical.
They stood around drinking beer and looking snotty for a full year.
And then one day before we actually needed the bastards, they managed to get themselves killed.
So if you've got a suggestion, we'd be delighted to hear it.
Otherwise, take your conscience elsewhere while we think about saving your ass.
Land's sakes. Where's time gone to, huh?
Miss Peekins' eldest is feeling poorly.
I promised I'd...
Will you gentlemen excuse me?
Well, we were talking about hiring a gunfighter.
Yeah, we don't know anything about that fellow there.
Well, we know he took the best we could find to hire, like Grant took Vicksburg.
Yeah, with a hidden gun in his lap.
Three for three.
One right between the eyes.
Goddamndest shooting I ever even heard of.
I still say we're asking for trouble!
A fellow like that, what do we know about him?
Who is he?
Where does he come from?
Well, you've got our permission to go and ask him.
Although, the last three that tried that didn't fare all that well.
Let me out!
Put me down, you bastard!
Let go of me, you fat lug!
Get the hell off me!
Let go of me!
You fat pig!
Hey, come here.
What is this?
I was just down there sounding out that stranger, when she come in there blasting away like a Cheyenne!
All right, Sam. All right.
You're planning to let him get away with this, aren't you?
- Be a little patient, will you?
- Patient?
Callie, when you run across a man who's used to having his own way, you let him have it until he goes too far.
Just what do you consider going too far?
I mean, isn't forcible rape in broad daylight a misdemeanor in this town?
There's too much at stake to throw away on hysterics now.
Hysterics?
Well, I can remember some hysterics one night not too long ago.
Callie, keep your mouth shut!
Morgan, get her out of here.
I'll see you later.
Yeah.
Not while that squinty-eyed son of a bitch is still breathing, you won't!
You wonder if there's a man left in this town!
I mean, one honest-to-God man with a full set of balls!
Well...
Why not?
'Cause I'm not a gunfighter.
Oh, now, don't get fact mixed up with stupid. You...
Besides, I have nothing against these men.
Who did you say they are?
Well, Stacey Bridges and his cousins, the Carlin boys, they worked for the company. They...
You know, what you call troubleshooters.
You know, just like those three you done in yesterday, except when they was here before, there was lots of trouble.
And they took care of it, too.
Except, well, they got too damn big for their britches.
Started pushing people around, and taking over the town and we had to...
Had to what?
Well, we had to take them into custody, that's what.
Yeah. I clapped the old bracelets on them myself.
Hey, you won't be wanting that slab of pie, will you?
You know what happened, friend, is they stole a golden ingot out of the mining office down there, and they hid it under the floorboard of the shack that they lived in.
Kind of careless of them, wasn't it?
I mean, does a mining company usually leave gold ingots lying around like that?
Well, it does seem a bit peculiar, you know.
Matter of fact, Stacey kept bringing that up at the trial all the time, saying that he was being railroaded with.
And do you know that's why they're mad at us?
- No, I'll tell you what you can do, Sheriff.
- What?
When those boys come back to town, you just clap the bracelets right on them.
- Me?
- Yeah.
Well, I might have forgot to mention that they were all three passed out at the time, you know?
Look, I'm no lawman.
You know, they just hung this thing on me when that young Marshal Duncan was killed.
You know, he was whipped to death right here in this street.
Bullwhipped. Damndest thing I ever saw.
Now, why would anybody want to do a thing like that?
Well, I don't know.
It wasn't anybody from this town, anyhow.
How do you know?
Well, this is a good town, and these are good people.
And look, friend, we sure would like it if you'd help us with our problem.
Only problem you've got, Sheriff, is a short supply of guts.
You people don't need me.
Look.
Place a couple of good riflemen on top of that building up there.
Maybe a couple more with shotguns down behind grain bags over there.
A few more on this roof here.
Lookout up there in the bell tower.
Maybe a rifleman.
That should just about take care of it.
Well, what would it take to see that through, you know?
The ambush. What would it cost us?
Sheriff, I don't know if I really like this town that much.
Well, this is a God-fearing town.
These are God-fearing people.
You like them, you save them.
Look, what if we offered you anything you want?
Anything?
Unlimited credit. That's what it means.
An open charge account with no reckoning.
What His Honor's trying to say is you got yourself a free hand in this town, friend.
Any damn thing I want, huh?
Yeah. Go on. Help yourself.
Help yourself! Go ahead.
It's my pleasure.
Yes, sir.
Anything you want that's here, as best as we can get it for you, we will.
Even if it's some little squaw or a Mex and keep your bed warm at night.
Hey, you!
Keep your sticky fingers off them blankets if you're not buying.
And keep them kids under control.
Goddamn savages.
And besides, you know, about handling that ambush, you know, everybody in town, more or less, is at your orders.
Here you go.
No, no. No.
Tell him it's all right.
It's all right.
Anything I want?
Now, how's that feel?
Not bad. I'll take them.
All right, that's three pairs of hand-stitched boots and a tooled belt with silver buckle.
Let's see, that'll be, five and two, carry the nine, and that comes to exactly...
No charge.
Come on, now.
I'd like to get all these people a drink.
Yes, sir. One round for the house.
There you are.
This gentleman here's buying a round for the house.
No fair. No fair. I ordered one, too.
Don't I get a glass of beer?
You get a glass of beer, right there.
Coming up.
There we are.
Now, that's one round for the house, sir.
Anything else?
Get yourself something.
Oh, thank you very kindly, sir.
I'll have a cigar.
And smoke it later.
Now, including the smoke, that comes to about $8.50.
There's no charge, Lutie.
You was at the meeting.
Anything he wants in this town, he gets.
You voted on it.
I didn't know that meant free whiskey.
Well, everybody's got to put something in the kitty, right?
Right.
About time this town had a new sheriff.
I'm the sheriff? I'm the sheriff.
I'm sorry, Sam.
But you looked so comical when he put your badge on the runt.
I'm not a runt anymore.
I'm the sheriff.
And the mayor.
And I'm the mayor.
Any objections?
No. No, that's fine.
I'm the mayor. I'm the sheriff.
No more, "Mordecai, bring the water.
"Mordecai, take the laundry.
Clean up the mess."
Hot damn!
I'm gonna declare a holiday.
Hot damn!
Wait a minute.
I can't be a sheriff if I don't have a gun.
Is this about the size gun you're looking for?
No, that one. That'll do.
Whatever this gent wants, he's to have.
That's orders of Mr. Drake and Mr. Allen.
I want every man in the regiment to have one of these nice rifles.
What regiment?
The City of Lago Volunteers.
Never heard of them.
Why, you ought to, you're in it.
So are you, you, and all of you out there.
I want you all out in the street in 10 minutes for drill.
Well, that's that.
Bridges, you Carlin boys, don't forget your tickets back here to my little hotel.
And don't worry. They ain't loaded.
What about our horses?
We had three good animals.
What do you think you've been eating the last six months?
Damn him! Dog, I didn't eat my own horse!
That slop he fed us wasn't our horses.
He just stole them and sold them to somebody.
- That's what he done!
- Shut up.
- Well, that's what he done!
- Shut up.
When we get to Lago, you can have the mayor's horse.
Fried or barbecued.
Well, I guess we walk some.
Old Drake and Allen don't seem to have remembered.
Oh, they'll remember.
One way or another, they'll remember.
All right.
You don't wanna get shot.
You don't want your shops or your houses burned.
You don't want your women touched.
You don't want anything to happen.
Except you're afraid to do anything about it.
Or you don't know how.
Shit.
Fire! Fire!
Come on, fire!
I don't remember lending my wagons to be shot up by these goddamn fools out here.
You know, you're gonna look awfully silly with that knife sticking up your ass.
Fire! Pull those triggers!
Come on, shoot!
Shoot!
Aim! Fire!
You still here?
No. No, I was... I was just going.
Damn! Can you do that every time?
Damn right he can.
We're not gonna have a thing in the world to worry about.
This is gonna be a picnic!
All right, keep them after us, huh?
Go on, out there.
You men carpenters?
Sí, señor. We do rough fixing.
Could you make some tables, big ones, that a lot of people could sit?
Like for a church picnic?
Exactly.
Well, you could use sawhorses and one-by-twelves.
Could you have them ready for me by tomorrow morning?
If we have the lumber.
You'll have the lumber.
Come on with me.
You really planning a picnic?
Any objection?
No, just it's the damndest thing
I ever heard of.
- You haven't heard the funny part.
- What's that?
You're furnishing the beer and whiskey.
Oh, Preacher.
Good morning, Brother Belding.
Mrs. Lake was just asking about you.
Oh, how is the dear old soul?
Oh, she's chipper as a jaybird.
I don't know how she does it.
Well, she's got the strength of her faith,
Brother Belding.
Praise God. The strength of her faith.
Too bad about your barn. Termites?
There's nothing wrong with my barn.
It's sound as a dollar.
Then how come those two Mexs is tearing it down?
What?
What do you greasy bastards think you're doing to my barn?
Exactly what I told them.
We're requisitioning your barn, Belding.
Any objection?
You men can go back to work.
Would you mind telling me what the hell's going on here?
And you can help out, too.
You mean, you want me to help you tear down my barn?
Wait a minute.
Maybe he'd be better use if he'd help us collect the few little items we're still missing.
Items? What items? What for?
You got the list, Sheriff.
Read it to him.
We still need 35 bedsheets, one barbecued steer and 200 gallons of red paint.
Red paint?
We're counting on you for the bedsheets.
Is there anything else?
Yes, there is.
How long is it gonna take you to get everybody out of your hotel?
What?
Everybody out.
How long is it gonna take?
Why, I just can't...
I mean, I got eight people living in rooms up there in my hotel.
Now, I just...
Where are they gonna go?
Out.
You know better than to walk in a man's camp and...
What the hell is going on?
Well, Stacey, looks like we got three fresh horses.
Wait a while.
He's got him some snappy duds.
Faster!
Fire! Pull that trigger!
Go on!
Go on!
Shoot!
Pull that trigger!
Fire!
Any improvement?
Some.
You know, Lew and I were thinking, maybe we were a little hasty in our decision.
What do you mean?
Well, maybe we don't need any outside help to solve our problem.
Hell, Dave, maybe we don't even have a problem.
Every man who ever got sent up, went away saying he's gonna come back and get even, right?
But think about it.
Can you actually remember anyone ever coming back and doing anything?
I can't think of one. Can you?
The point being, you want to get rid of the gunfighter. Is that it?
Now, Dave, we got to before it's too late.
He's making a mock of this whole town.
Making that little dwarf the sheriff.
Kicking my own people out of my own hotel.
Got half of the women in town sewing bedsheets together.
They're my bedsheets!
Got those Mexicans down there building long picnic tables.
Lutie Naylor, down there barbecuing a whole damn steer.
Some kind of a picnic.
Right here in our own town.
Sounds pretty good to me.
What do you mean?
I mean, it sounds like a good idea, bringing everything out in the open so we can see it.
Don't you see what we're saying?
This whole thing's all for nothing.
They're probably all three blind drunk in some Nogales whorehouse right now.
Well, if they're dead drunk in Nogales, we'll know in 24 hours.
Surely we can put up with the man for one more day.
No. I say no.
He's got this whole town so people are beginning to turn on each other.
What's the matter, Morgan?
Anybody special turn on you?
You want to spell that out, Drake?
Spell it yourself.
I'm not gonna jeopardize everything
I've built here because some blond bitch and he threw you out of bed.
God damn you!
Don't talk to me that way.
I'll talk to you any way I like!
I'll say anything I have to say as long as I'm running this company.
Well, say it, but you could listen once in a while yourself, you know.
What's the matter, Morgan?
You're not getting your fair share of the profits?
Profits. It's not the profits.
It's just that this whole business has gone sour since that deal with that former Marshal Duncan.
Wait a minute, we had no choice in that matter, and you know it.
- Come on!
- Wait a minute...
The big mistake we made was hiring that man Duncan in the first place,
- and you did that all by yourself.
- All by myself?
- Quiet. Shut up. We can trust one another.
- Guys, please...
This whole town had a hand in what happened.
Hell, why do you think Stacey Bridges and the Carlin brothers kept their mouths shut all this time?
Same reason everybody else did in this town.
One hang, we all hang.
Now, you just grit your teeth a little bit longer.
The gunfighter stays till I say otherwise.
You understand?
Well, there it is, just like he said.
That stranger's got everybody turning on everybody.
Being put out after all these years.
That man!
Right here.
Okay, folks, put your bags right here in the wagon.
All right, folks, just put your bags right here in the wagon.
Right here.
What's going on here?
What the hell does it look like is going on, Preacher?
They're emptying my whole hotel.
Throwing out paying guests, right into the street just to make room for our new guardian angel.
He likes to be by himself, more or less.
You see who's running our town now?
He's sitting right over there, Mr. Belding.
If you don't like it why don't you just go over there and tell him that he can't?
Mordecai, someday soon someone's going to step on your scrawny little neck, you lizard, and when they do, you're going to be nothing but a squished monster.
See here, you can't turn all these people out into the night.
It is inhuman, brother. Inhuman!
I'm not your brother.
We are all brothers in the eyes of God.
All these people, are they your sisters and brothers?
They most certainly are.
Then you won't mind if they come over and stay at your place, will you?
All right, folks, let's go!
Put your bags up here! Let's hurry up!
Friends, friends, don't worry.
We shall find haven for you in our own homes.
And it won't cost you one cent more than regular hotel rates.
Paid up, that's ridiculous.
My room ready?
Two connecting rooms, the best in the hotel.
One for entertaining your many new friends in town, and one for sleeping.
If your conscience lets you sleep.
Oh, I sleep just fine, ma'am.
Is that so?
You care to see for yourself?
You tell Mrs. Belding there'll be two for supper.
I like chicken, fried.
And anything else?
Best bottle of wine in town.
Remember, he won't be around forever, you little...
Marshal.
Somebody, please help me.
What are you doing?
- Let go of me! You've got to stop this!
- Not now!
Let go of me!
Damn you all to hell.
How did you get in here?
You had your chance and you missed it.
You're hurting me.
What do you want?
Just a little pleasant female company for supper.
- You know what you are?
- What?
You're an animal.
Yeah, well, you have a way of bringing that out.
No, thank you, but I don't eat with dogs.
You might, if it's the dog that runs the pack.
Give me a half an hour to get ready.
You're ready right now.
I could be readier.
Half an hour.
You know, actually, I eat like a bird.
I've got it.
I knew that old bastard Hobart had it in a hole under the store.
Look. But I've got it.
Yeah, all the way from France.
Yeah, would you stick a bent knife in that, get the cork out?
Do you have any special request for dessert?
No, I've already taken care of that.
Can't fix that without a blacksmith or a vet.
Maybe both.
Hell, we'll find neither one out here.
Well, I'll tell you something, Stace.
I think we've been pushing too hard.
I mean, like as not, all three of these horses could have come up lame.
Hell, I feel pretty lame myself, not being on a horse 12 months in that damn jail.
Back off, Cole.
Maybe we ought to leave you and the horse here.
Well, now, Stace, I didn't mean nothing.
Hell, Stacey, he can ride double with me until we come across somebody.
We'll all need fresh animals.
All right! Quit crying about it.
I'll tell you what, though.
Soon as they find those bodies back there, they're gonna have a hunting party out for us.
And I want time to take one year of my life out of Lago before we move on.
How long is that gonna take, you figure?
A lifetime for some of them.
You're out late, Mordecai.
...and fornication and sins of the flesh.
That's what's going on under my roof right now while I'm talking to you.
That stranger has taken over my whole hotel, and thrown good, honest, decent folk right out into the night.
Well, why didn't you stop him, Lewis?
You've got a gun.
You shut your fat mouth, Sam.
We're tired of giving you money for doing an incompetent job!
Don't you talk to me that way!
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Please! Look at us!
Sweet God, look what's happening to us.
That's right.
It's just like the preacher says.
That stranger's got everybody in this town at each other's throats.
He's set himself up like a king!
He's got you all snake fascinated, every damn one of you!
This crazy picnic.
200 gallons of blood-red paint.
It couldn't be worse if the devil himself had ridden right into Lago.
Welcome to Lago, you son of a bitch.
Get out of here!
They're here, Father!
I'm sorry.
Morg!
Morg!
Where are you going?
Morg, Morg, take me with you!
Morg? Morg, you better take me with you.
Morg, where are you going?
Morg! Morg!
Don't leave me here!
He'll kill me!
Get off my cuffs. Let's go!
Oh, no.
Oh, my beautiful hotel.
They promised me that they wouldn't...
Ruined.
A total loss.
Didn't even touch my store.
Look, I want you to watch that pilfering.
You know, I hold you responsible, Sheriff.
- I'm not your goddamn sheriff.
- You!
Say, I'll need one, two...
Two up there.
I'll need four boxes from you, and shovels from you, so these people can dig the holes.
Well, yes...
But I thought perhaps we could...
Right now.
Yeah. All right, everyone.
Was you here?
I mean, did you see anything?
Somebody left the door open, and the wrong dogs came home.
Yeah. Well...
- Get the shovel, will you?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I hope you're not gonna blame us for Morgan Allen's stupidity.
Because the rest of us here have an agreement with you.
Well, right now I don't feel too agreeable.
Well, maybe a little bonus will make you a little more appreciative.
How little?
500 a head.
500 an ear?
Done. Done.
You promised that son of a bitch $3,000 after what he did to my hotel?
Promising's one thing. Paying's another.
He may just catch a bullet.
Oh, you and Lewis can grab shovels, too.
I knew you were cruel, but I didn't know how far you could go.
Well, you still don't.
Well, it doesn't matter to you.
I don't know where you're gonna sleep now.
Bodies everywhere.
All the rooms are ruined except for our room.
Wait. Wait a minute.
Oh, no.
Oh, no. No.
No, let go, let go! Lewis!
Lewis, don't just stand there.
Let go of me! Let go!
Stop! Look, you don't need me.
Let go! Let go!
Let go of me!
What are you gonna do with those?
Defend myself.
Against what?
It's no secret what you did to Callie Travers.
Did?
The other day in the stable.
As I recall, she enjoyed that quite a bit.
I promise you, I won't.
Well, you flatter yourself, lady.
I flatter myself?
Yeah, I'd love to oblige you, but a man's got to get his rest sometime.
Oblige me?
But I'll tell you what.
If you come back in about a half-hour,
I'll see what I can do, all right?
Why, you low-down, stinking, son of a...
Have you ever heard the name Jim Duncan?
I've heard a lot of things. Why?
He was town marshal here.
He's lying out there in an unmarked grave.
They say the dead don't rest without a marker of some kind.
Do you believe that?
What makes you think I care?
I don't know.
He's the reason this town's afraid of strangers.
I was going to warn you about that.
Pretty funny.
What's funny?
You ask me that in a blown-up hotel with seven dead men to your credit already?
I was just stopping by for a bottle of whiskey and a nice hot bath.
All right. If you say so.
You don't believe me?
Mister, whatever you say is fine with me.
Be careful.
You're a man who makes people afraid, and that's dangerous.
Well, it's what people know about themselves inside that makes them afraid.
I don't know if we shouldn't mark the grave somehow.
Sam?
I don't see any need.
Ain't likely that anybody's gonna cry over them anyhow.
You know what to do.
Yes, sir, Captain.
All right!
Everybody grab a brush and start in.
You mean, you want the whole place painted?
Everything.
You can't possibly mean the church, too.
I mean especially the church.
All right, I'll paint if you say we've got to, but when we get done, this place is gonna look like hell.
Hello, Lewis.
I want you to go to that meeting with me, Sarah.
It's very important.
No.
Not now, not ever.
They are still your neighbors!
Yes, they're my neighbors, and they make me sick.
Hiding behind words like "faith," "peace," and "trust."
Good words. Damn good words.
But we hid a murder behind them.
Won't you never understand, woman?
It wasn't anything we wanted to do.
When Duncan found out the mine was on government property, it was just a technicality, really, but he was determined to turn us in.
Wouldn't listen to reason.
Is that why?
Is that really why it happened?
Don't you see, Sarah?
They would have closed down the mine!
Do you know what would've happened to this town then?
It would've been the end of everything that we've worked on.
All of it, all of us!
And you, too, wife.
Now, sometimes we have to do what's necessary to do, for the good of everybody.
That's the price of progress.
And what's the price of a human life, Lewis?
Ask your good friends if they know that.
Your damn conscience.
I'll say, it's sure taken a hell of a while to bother you.
I'm packing to leave, Lewis.
I won't be coming back.
That's Morg Allen, or what's left of him.
Well, now, what's he doing, riding around here like that?
He's come back to pay us back for some jail time that was rightfully his.
Only he don't know it yet.
Stacey, help me.
My arm. Help me.
Help me, Stacey.
I'm curious, Morg.
You helped them railroad us, and you've got the balls to come down here and ask us for a favor?
Goddamn if I don't admire you.
Do something about my arm, Stacey.
Well, I am doing something, Morg.
Sitting here watching you bleed to death.
Stacey, things have changed in Lago.
You need me.
I gotta tell you about it.
I gotta tell you about it.
Yeah. From the looks of your arm, Morg, it looks like you've run your welcome out in Lago, and ours, too.
What me and the boys want to know is how we're gonna pick up
12 months' back pay and everything else that's owed us.
Stacey, for God's sakes!
No, no. For our sake.
Now you can help us, all right, and you can help yourself, too.
Now you just give me the combination to that big iron box in the back of your office, and me and the boys will just... seak right in there real quiet-like, take what's ours, bring you the rest, or leave it there safe and sound, that's up to you.
First, of course, we'll fix up your arm, set you over there in the shade with a nice canteen full of water.
You no-good, worthless son of a bitch.
You're probably right about that.
Give me that combination, Morg.
I wouldn't give you the combination to the gates of hell.
Dog!
Sure had a lot of blood left in him, didn't he?
Two sticks of dynamite will take care of that iron box, anyway.
We don't need him.
Dan, you hit?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
Damn near tore my leg off!
Who the hell is that?
Must be Dave Drake.
What the hell did you hit?
Keep shooting, damn it!
He shot my ear off!
Somebody up there's playing games.
He shot my ear off!
Well, he could've shot your whole damn head off!
Now get down!
Dave, is that you?
Come on out! We'll settle this.
Morg was almost dead, anyway, from that arm!
I just put him out of his misery!
I'll kill you!
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!
Come down out of there, you bastard!
I'll cut your heart out!
Let's go up there, Stacey.
There might be some more dynamite.
I'll get him. I'll get him, whoever it was up there.
I'll kill every man in Lago!
The guests are on their way to the party, so gather all the people together.
Right, Captain!
All right, men, get that sign up!
Come on! They're coming!
All right, everybody, come on!
Get a little move on!
I want you up in that tower.
First sign of dust, you ring the bell, you hear?
Are you sure this is gonna be all right?
It's gonna be all right.
He's back! He's here.
It's time to get ready.
What's the matter with everybody?
Wait till we gun them down.
Bang, bang, bang!
All right, everybody,
I think we're expected outside.
I just hope that shooter we hired is feeling up to snuff.
Don't worry. He'll be fine.
Let's go.
Hey, señor, can we come to the fiesta?
No.
I want everybody to have plenty of those.
Hey, ain't it about time we got out there, huh?
There's plenty of time.
Yeah, but they'll be here any damn minute.
I think Sam's right. We ought to.
Yeah.
What about after?
What about after we do it?
What do we do then?
Then you live with it.
Where you gonna be?
Are you gonna take the first shot?
Are you gonna get Stacey Bridges first?
Or maybe you're gonna get all three by yourself?
When are you gonna give the signal?
I'm not. You are.
You old people, move out of here!
Here they come!
Come on!
Fire!
Fire! Fire!
Get them.
Don't shoot me. Don't! Don't.
A party? A party?
Welcome home party, huh?
Well, here's to your party.
Give me another bottle.
Give me another bottle!
Well, now the party's over.
- Stace!
- Let go of me!
Look what I found in the bushes.
Look what I found in the bushes!
Stacey, it was always you.
That's why Morg Allen hated you.
He knew how much I loved you.
Yeah, I bet you just cried yourself to sleep every night thinking about me in that territorial prison.
But I did. I really did!
Yeah, well, I can see it all now.
You lying there in Morg Allen's bed, just a-crying and a-humping.
Oh, no, no!
Give me that bottle.
Cole, go and get the horses ready.
You got it, Stace.
Stacey. Stacey, you're gonna take me with you, aren't you?
I can do better than you in a four-bit fancy house.
You still here?
God damn right I'm still here.
I wanna know who them sons of bitches was that ambushed us.
That's what I'd like to know.
That's what we're gonna find out right now.
Who are you?
Don't hit me.
Don't hit me, please!
Please, don't hit me.
Please, stop!
Please, don't hit me! Please!
- Come on, Stacey. Let's get out of here.
- Shut up.
Okay, everybody out.
Everybody out!
Out!
Come on, move!
Go on. Get out!
Move!
Go on.
Move!
Hurry up in there. Move!
Move!
Move!
Move!
Hold up there! Get in there!
Hold it right there!
- Dynamite!
- Dynamite!
Stacey, the goddamn horses are gone.
Go on. Go on!
Help me.
Help me.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm just about done here.
I never did know your name.
Yes, you do.
Take care.
Yes, sir, Captain.
Your land runs a thousand rods to the left of that big tree... then it follows the creek.
You keep this paper good.
You want to stay with us a spell?
Sure be obliged.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Listen to me, you hear?
You people from Louisiana, ain't ya?
There's plenty of good work for ya back there... choppin' cotton, cuttin' cane.
Good jobs with people who know you.
You was born there.
You was raised there.
You don't belong out here.
You couldn't last the winter.
You ain't got no place to live.
No farm tools, no sheep.
So you're gonna turn around and go home.
Hey, you.
Come here.
Where's Buck?
I'm looking for your wagonmaster name of Buck.
No Buck here.
Don't know nobody named Buck.
He's the one that brought you here.
So where'd he go? Where'd you hire him, and where's he stayin'?
He had a name something else.
Ain't no Buck!
Where is Buck?
He's near here, Floyd.
You're gonna go outside, wave to your old man.
If you holler, I'll kill everything around here that moves.
Everything.
Get them horses! Floyd!
Get goin'!
Howdy do!
- I need a horse.
- I can see that.
I'll pay you $20.
That's a handsome price.
But I ain't in the horse-trading business, brother.
I got to travel fast.
I sure do wish I could be of service to you, but...
- I don't want to have to take him.
- Who says you have to?
Hold it.
Any objection if I get into my drawers?
Or do you need them, too?
Just gettin' my boots, brother.
- You're eatin' my rabbit.
- What you doin' out here?
Gettin' into my drawers.
- You gonna take my horse!
- Drop your drawers.
- Wait a minute!
- Drop them!
Damn!
You forgot your coffee!
There's two mountains pointin' up to the sky.
Beyond that there's a valley, green... with cool water.
I can see it's there.
Called Colorado.
But don't turn back.
That valley is going to be our home.
We're going on.
All right.
Night riders hit Pappy Whitlock and his people here two weeks ago.
3 days later they burned a wagon train supposed to meet me at Sulphur Flats.
About here.
Then they got the Deep Smith County people... at the water hole this side of Clayton.
They're headin' this way.
You got to move out tonight.
Mornin', sir.
Could you get me a bottle of whiskey out here?
You could go inside.
My man, good liquor is best enjoyed in the open firmament.
Anyways, my heart yearneth for the dusky company of my own emancipated people.
Where are the colored folks around here, son? Where do you live?
My mammy and the rest at Mr. Logan's place ten miles out.
- Do all the colored live there?
- No, sir. We just passin' through.
We made a crop for Mr. Logan.
Boy!
The whiskey.
Forty cents a bottle, cash money.
Oh, yeah.
Where'd you get that horse?
That animal was delivered to me in the wilderness.
Where's the man who rode that horse?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?
A man cometh and a man goeth.
In this trackless wilderness, who shall know but the Lord?
Don't play with me.
There's nobody back there,
Uncle Beau.
Where's Buck?
- Is his name Buck?
- Where is he?
I'm lookin' for that miserable... no good, lowdown sinner myself.
When I find him, I'll smite him hip and thigh.
- How come you got his horse?
- On account he stole mine.
And left me out there to perish.
He's lyin'.
As God is my judge!
I swear on this Bible!
What you doin' out here?
Just wanderin' as the Lord wills, spreadin' the word of the gospel.
I'm doin' like you gentlemen.
I'm just fightin' sin.
Hear me.
We want this Buck.
We want him bad.
You see him, you tell us where he is... there's $500 for you.
You remember that?
Five hundred dollars.
That's easy to remember.
I don't suppose for that kind of money you particular whether he dead or alive.
Either.
And if in my search for this sinner,
I finds him... where do I finds you gentlemen?
Copper Springs.
Ask for Deshay.
Mr. Deshay.
So you a wanderin' preacher ministering to your people out here?
Yes, sir.
Though they's few and far between, the need for salvation is everywhere.
Best thing you can tell 'em.
Turn around.
Go back home.
"Turn around and go back home."
Young man!
- Pleasant afternoon.
- Yes, sir.
You walk home every day?
No, sir.
I sleeps under the bar.
But they finished with the crop for Mr. Logan... and they goin' to have roast pig and chicken.
That a fact?
Who's your preacher?
We ain't got none.
Then who gives thanks to the Lord?
Old Uncle Cudjo.
He's more conjurer than preacher.
That a fact?
May I prevail upon you to share my beast of burden?
The horse, son.
Who's that with Toby?
Blessings in His name.
I'm the Reverend
Willis Oakes Rutherford... of the high and low order of the Holiness Persuasion Church.
- Where you from, Reverend?
- Sunflower County, Mississippi, mostly.
Where you headin'?
In the vastness of God's green earth, there is no corner... that does not challenge my ministry.
I'm headed there, and I could be there tomorrow.
Where you from, brother?
We all from St. Anne Parish,
Louisiana.
My name is Kingston.
Pleased to meet you, Brother Kingston.
Well, well.
- Sister.
- Reverend.
- You've come a long way.
- And we goin' further yet.
I do admire to meet a good Christian congregation.
Yes.
And if you'll permit me... after a bit of supper...
I would like to offer a prayer for your safe guidance here... beneath the wonders of God's creation.
How'd you find me?
I asked your horse.
It's all right.
It ain't nothin'
- What's on your mind?
- My horse, amongst other things.
You get your horse.
What are you doin' 'round here?
Spreading the sweet word of the gospel.
You a preacher?
The Reverend Willis Oakes Rutherford... of the high and low order of the Holiness Persuasion Church.
You can take supper here.
That'll square for the rabbit.
You can rest a while, and then you move on.
Buck.
Fifty, 60, 70, 80, 90.
Four hundred, 410, 420.
Four mules, a litter of pigs.
Right on the barrelhead, fair and square.
That's right.
If you folks want to stay and plant another crop, we'll make the same deal.
No. We better be movin' on.
But much obliged to you anyway, sir.
All right.
Which way you ridin',
Preacher?
I've not exactly settled my mind yet.
You've got three possibilities:
North, south or east.
- What happened to west?
- We goin' west.
There's a lot of room out in the West.
It's not elbow to elbow out that way.
You got your horse.
Don't press your luck.
Tell me something, Buck.
What you got against me?
Nothin'. 'Cept it's a fool farmer let the weasel travel in the chicken coop.
I know an Eastman when I see one.
These people ain't for pickin'.
I told you I ain't no Eastman.
I'm a preacher.
On the other hand, you could say it's a might stuffy out there to the west.
Amen, brother.
Fivefold, amen.
- You double your watch tonight, hear?
- I'll do that.
I'll be back tomorrow by sundown at the latest.
- You can find water holes on the map?
- Yeah, they're plain.
Indians!
Buck, Indians!
- What are you doing?
- Get off your horse.
- Have you looked behind you recent?
- Get down!
Don't tell me you done took to prayin'.
Preacher, you do as I say.
Hunker down and keep your mouth shut.
Sweet Jesus.
Lord of mercy, look at that.
If you don't be quiet, you're gonna be dead.
- Do you have good health?
- Yes.
- Things go well?
- Some things, some days.
What do you want, Sergeant?
I got a wagon train comin' through.
Forty head of people, not including children.
- What kind of people?
- Black.
I want them to get through safe to the pass... north of the salt wales on the west bank of the Pecos.
You have five days to pass.
That's pressing. They've got sorry horses and worn-out mules.
Five days.
All right.
Ten dollars each one.
I was thinking on $6.
Eight.
They've gotta live through the winter, and they got children.
Tell him children ain't worth eight.
Eight. Children nothing.
They gonna need food. I can get by if I kill three buffalo.
One buffalo.
My husband say two buffalo if you must.
Thank you.
Brother, you're a man of many parts.
How do you know how to dicker with Indians?
Why were you trackin' me?
Me? Fact is, I got lost.
I praise God I found your tracks or I might've perished here like a heathen.
Toby?
My God!
Okay. It's all right now.
Get me some water.
The money's gone.
All $1400.
How we gonna live through the winter?
Where we gonna get food and seed?
Ain't no use.
We done been turned around.
Penny. Suzanna.
Tom DeCooper.
Joseph.
Rachel and Toby.
All dead.
But the valley is there.
Green and wild.
It's there.
We gonna go on.
You ain't got no supplies, no food.
You can't make it through the winter.
Then we dies in the snow.
No, you ain't gonna die in the snow.
- The old man said we're goin' on?
- Yeah.
Then we're goin'.
But you know we ain't got the money to pay what we owe you.
Don't matter.
You paid for safe passage through the Indian land.
You'll cross north of the salt wales.
You only got five days to pass.
I'll find you somewhere north of the Pecos.
Ain't nothin' left here for you,
Eastman.
You can come or go.
It don't matter.
You ever hear of Copper Springs?
Ten riders, boss named Deshay.
How you know?
They catched me with your horse in a stop called Frenchman's Ford.
They asked a lot of mean questions.
Now I know why.
Copper Springs?
I heard 'em say they holes up there.
And I remember every one of them faces.
- Deshay, hold up a minute.
- Ollie, how are things?
I wanna talk to you.
Delighted.
Floyd, get me a bourbon.
You ran into a couple of wagon trains out yonder.
We just had a little talk is all.
You listen to me, Deshay.
Nobody's gonna be gunned downed, whipped or burned out in this town... as long as I have a say so.
That goes for the coloreds as well as anyone else.
Ollie, I just rode in to pick up my mail and spend a little time at Esther's.
Never mind. I'm tellin' ya.
Those folks can come and go as they like. That's the law.
Sheriff, you got an official complaint against me and my boys?
We are bona fide labor recruiters... employed by the
Delta Planters Association in Louisiana.
There's a whole way of life back there goin' down the drain.
We don't intend to see it frittered away.
I don't care who you're workin' for.
This ain't Louisiana.
You walk soft in my town.
That's them.
Deshay is the one with the hat.
There's only eight of 'em in there.
The other two are in the saloon.
You taking eight of 'em in one gulp?
Five.
Three of 'em busy upstairs.
They ain't tied down forever.
I just gotta catch 'em off guard.
Let me talk to 'em.
You catch 'em off guard.
Blessings on this house!
I am Reverend Willis Oakes Rutherford of the Holy Persuasion Church.
Get out!
You do recollect we've encountered each other previous.
- It's that old preacher.
- Yes!
I run a selective house.
This ain't a New Orleans crib.
Shut up.
What you want?
You do recall there was a mean old silly... you was interested in by the name of Buck.
You know where he is?
They have eyes that see not until they are open!
Don't trifle with me.
I ain't trifling, sir.
But I do seem to remember that there was a sum mentioned.
$500 to be exact.
Where is he?
Yea, though he flees as a shadow, yet will I lead thee to him... but for $500.
I ain't gonna bargain with you.
You tell us where he's at, and maybe we talk money.
Get him out!
I've got my reputation.
Thy suffers that woman Jezebel who calleth herself a prophetess... to teach and seduce my servants into fornication.
Revelations, chapter 2.
What is he doing here?
He's preachin'.
That's right, brother, I'm preachin'.
And my text is fornication.
He that committeth fornication sineth against his own body. Corinthians 1.
That's you, Esther!
"That's you, Esther!"
Fornication!
That's the way to ruination.
That's the way they's taught the nation.
Go, Preacher!
You keep up that fornicatin', it'll take you to ruination.
This man there he just fornicates.
Yes, sir.
He's comin' and he's waitin', got no time for fornicatin'.
I'm Buck.
I put my faith in the Good Book.
Ain't no more than $100 here.
I got about $30.
Where's the money?
Where is it?
The money!
I'm talking to you.
Where is it?
Buck, we've got to move!
Come on, Preacher.
Stick to me, Jesus.
Will you hurry up?
Are they gonna track us through four miles of sheep-dip?
They don't have to. They know where
I've got to go. They've been there.
$157! They drunk up and screwed away more than $1,000!
That's a lot of drinkin'.
And they didn't even have my $500.
What $500?
What they was gonna pay me to deliver you.
Well, I'm here, ain't I?
And they's dead, ain't they?
Yeah.
Jesus!
You all right?
I ran to Aunt Pennybeggers, and she took me in.
- They didn't hurt you none?
- Cuff me on the head, that's all.
That's all.
They hit the Saint Anne Parish people.
They killed some, and they burned 'em out.
- You better rest.
- I ain't got no time.
I didn't know if you was alive or dead.
I couldn't come back.
They might've been waitin'.
I know, I know.
Horses are in the thicket.
That's Ruth.
Ruth, this is Preacher.
Your servant, ma'am.
Y'all sit down.
I get you something to eat.
Where can we get some horses around here?
Elias Pennybegger has horses.
We can trust them.
She's my friend.
How many horses?
At least one for you.
You've got to come. They've been here once, they can come again.
- They still after you?
- Not all of them. Some dead.
Eight to be exact.
We goin' north like we said, to Canada?
No, we can't.
Not yet.
Why not?
Where we goin'?
You done what you could in this country, and it all end on fire in a grave.
I ain't gonna live in this land no more.
You hear me?
The war ain't changed nothing or nobody.
It's a poison soaked into the ground.
They gonna give us nothing.
Not no 40 acres and no mule.
And not freedom, neither.
It's a poison soaked into the ground.
The time is going. I don't wanna spend my life washing other people's clothes.
I wanna live somewhere with you, Buck, like natural people.
I wanna have your children... and raise them someplace where there ain't a shadow of slavery.
I think about sewing, making pretty things for my family... while my hands are still steady.
I wanna go someplace with you, Buck.
I wanna have your children.
But I won't have 'em here.
I am going somewhere...
They won't have us in Canada...
I'll go to the edge of the ocean and I'll walks on away from here.
Saint Anne Parish folk... they're heading out there and they ain't got no food, no seed.
And they starve when the winter come.
Buck, honey, you just one man.
But I gave my word.
Eat your food.
I'll go see about the horses.
What you studying?
Troubled about all that killing.
I killed men before.
I just don't know which way to turn no more. I think they beat me.
Couldn't drivers do it in slavery days, nor the rebels in the war... but now I think... they beat me.
You're just tired.
When it's dark, looks like the heart just gets to hurting sometimes.
You gonna keep on fightin' best way you can.
Looks like there just ain't no other way.
I love you, Buck.
Where'd you get them cannons?
Gunsmith in Fort Leavenworth.
Where'd you get that funny Bible?
That my inheritance.
Before the war when I was a boy... my mama and me was sold to this traveling preacher.
I'd fetch for him, and take up collection.
And when he got drunk,
I'd haul him off to bed.
He traveled in these little towns preaching sin and hellfire.
And when he got them gals full of the Holy Spirit... when they're ready to repent, he'd jig 'em.
Between while... he'd take my mama to bed.
I'd sleep out with the horse.
By and by, about 16, he sent me to town for a jug of whiskey.
When I come back, my mama was gone.
He sold her for a couple hundred dollars.
He got drunk that night, and he said...
"Boy, put me to bed."
So I lead that man into the tanning yard by the lime pit.
I put him to bed right there.
I hold him under with a cedar fence rail.
There was no next of kin.
So I got the cart, the horse... preacher clothes and this funny Bible.
Where are you gonna find that money?
I don't know.
If it was me, I'd look for money where money's kept.
Like in a bank or an express office.
We gonna walk in the bank and just take it?
That's right, brother.
And I know just the place... where they ain't got no sheriff, no deputy, and hardly any menfolk...
'cause they out around the countryside chasing two poor field hands.
You're crazy.
Yeah.
What you want, boy?
You make a sound and you're a dead man.
We ain't got all day.
What's in the box?
- What's in the box?
- U.S. Government shipment.
Shipment of what?
What?
Gold.
Gold.
Sweet God Almighty, that's gold.
Where's the paper money?
There isn't any.
I sent the cash deposit to the bank.
Get off that.
- That's a whole mess of gold.
- You can't carry it on a horse.
Where's the key?
There's got to be a key!
In Texas.
They always send the key separate.
He's telling the truth, but there's got to be paper money.
I'm gonna ask you for the last time.
Where is that paper money?
I told ya.
At the bank.
I sent it over there.
What do you think?
What the hell? Otherwise we done wasted the whole morning.
Posse's riding by.
Sheriff's with 'em.
That's it.
Let's get outta here.
- I'm going to that bank.
- It's across from the sheriff's office.
There's a lot of money there.
Otherwise we done wasted the whole morning.
You're the one that's crazy.
- Mornin', Miss Esther. How you feelin'?
- Better, thanks.
Thing like that's not easy to forget, but life goes on.
- My money good enough for your bank?
- Money's money.
Hard earned, too.
Wages of sin.
Just so as I get three percent of 'em.
Someone stuck me with Ohio banknotes.
Are they any good?
That depends on the solvency of that particular bank.
They're gonna get away!
Yeah.
You shoot that rifle, boy, and we're dead!
You gonna quit?
Remember that wagon train you shot up?
- Yeah.
- They never did come back.
I wonder if they're planning on joining up with 'em.
He say he will not fight them for you.
I understand.
Tell him I just need help to get through to my people.
They need supplies.
I can pay. Dried meat as much as he can sell them. Horses, powder and shot.
Five horses.
No powder.
No guns.
Ask him again.
Tell him we're all brothers.
He will not give you guns.
They come too hard.
- Food.
- Dried meat.
Flour. Corn.
Do not ask for more.
He stopped that posse because he gave his word to let you through safe.
He will do no more.
Ask him again. Tell him they looking for a land for themselves... and they'll have to fight their way to find it...
'cause they can't live back there no way.
Before the yellow hair, my father, my grandfather hunted buffalo... raised pony, and took women on the land... where Fox River crosses the grassland at place of skull.
Now Copper Spring Fort Sheridan.
Now we are here with our backs against Snow Mountain.
And yellow hair send wagon, soldier and speaking wire.
Tomorrow we will be like ghosts... like the spirits that come in dreams with no earth to walk on.
But we will fight.
We will fight ten tens of years, and our children's children will fight.
We need our guns, bullets and powder for our own fight.
Tell him his enemies are our enemies.
He say you black people fought with that enemy against our people.
I ain't in the army no more.
He knows, Buck.
No guns.
No bullets.
Eighteen hundred dollars.
That's your share.
For what we have just received, we give thanks in Jesus' name. Amen.
I'm goin' back east to Illinois.
And I'm gonna buy me a tent.
I'm gonna have the biggest revival meetin' since King Solomon... preached to his wives and concubines.
And you, brother... you got a good woman there.
Take that money and buy yourself a livin' and do like she want.
Go to Canada.
All right, brother.
One question.
How do I get outta here?
To Illinois?
One or two ways. Back the way we come and across Kansas.
- There's a posse with a trigger hitch.
- Yes, there is.
What's the other way?
Keep on west across the Pecos to where I'm going.
Up into the mountains and north along the Idaho Territory... and back by the Canadian border.
- How long that take?
- All winter.
All winter. What's my chances of sneaking past the posse?
Not much.
When I first catched you eatin' my rabbit...
I should've gotten me a rock, busted you upside your head and left you for dead.
Scout come in.
That posse did not go back.
- They went tracking the wagon train.
- How close are they to the train?
One day ride from the big river.
How long will it take us to catch them riding straight through?
Maybe two days. He will give you guides to take you through the high pass.
Remember, they will not fight for you.
I know.
Well, looks like the back door's open.
Figure I can "skeet" on through and take my chances.
Brother, you done walked more than half the journey with them Saint Anne folk.
That's all a normal man can do.
What do you wanna die for 'em for?
What happened?
Somebody close the back door?
If they're gonna join up with 'em, they oughta do it before sundown.
Let's finish off that wagon train.
Ain't broke any laws.
- We gotta turn 'em around.
- What you got against them folks?
You on their side?
You soft in the head for them murderers?
They killed Uncle Bow.
They robbed the bank.
They didn't!
Buck and that preacher did.
That's all we're after.
You don't understand.
I gotta turn them field hands around.
If we leave them fields go fallow now, we done lost it all.
We gotta keep it goin' like it was, the way they rightfully belong.
You got 16 white men down there.
Just give me half of 'em, and I'll finish that job.
As far as I'm concerned, that wagon train can go anywhere it likes!
You make one move against those people...
I'll take you back to Copper Springs tied under the belly of your horse.
Where's Ollie?
Went to cover the pass.
Says you're in charge, Marcus.
Don't let that Buck come through.
- What does he want us to do?
- Take the wagon train.
If that's what he said... let's go!
- You gonna have to take it to 'em.
- What you gonna do?
We can draw them south.
You go with the wagon train.
I'll come to you later.
Get up on top.
Go in front of 'em and cut 'em off.
I run out.

[Wind howling]
No man should have to face mornin' or old man Bloodshy sober.
That's a good idea.
Why don't you wait here, and I'll go and get us a drink?
It'd been better if I'd thought of it five minutes ago.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa, there.
We are here, sir.
Here, I'll give you a hand.
You do, and you'll get my foot, you jailhouse jellyfish.
Mind the wind, sir.
And mind your business,
Mansfield.
[Howling continues]
Great glory.
Take a look at that sight, will ya?
Mine.
Bloodshy territory as far as the eye can see.
The doctors are quite concerned.
How much time does he have?
According to the doctors, if he doesn't take care of himself, it will be soon.
How much time if he does take care of himself?
They give me at least two days.
And that's why we're here.
To get a last look at what
I'm leaving to my heirs.
Heirs?
The land, the town, the money.
When you say ‘heirs,’ you do mean your son
Wild Billy, don't ya?
When I say ‘heirs,’
I mean just that.
I found my other boy.
Many years ago,
I grew a might too wild for my bride's highfalutin ways.
So one day, she up and ran off back to England, taking half my sons.
Half?
You mean you got two boys?
Traced him to Philadelphia.
This town needs another
Wild Billy like it needs an earthquake.
You eat them words afore I pound your face into a flapjack.
We better write a new will so everything's fair.
You can stick your quill back in the goose.
I already writ out my will.
And you ain't gettin' it until I'm ready to go.
But a new will?
Mansfield, what do you know about this?
Absolutely nothing, sir.
I never heard of it.
What are we gonna do?
Will you wait a minute while I think about this?
There's gotta be an answer.
Whoa!
- Bloodshy!
- Bloodshy!

Those guys over on 10th Street were listening a lot better.
They were throwing rocks.
Eli, is that you?
Oh, Father Joshua.
I'm sorry to bother you during your work, but I have a very important letter for you.
It's marked ‘special delivery’ and ‘urgent.’
And look at that postmark.
Arizona territory.
That's way out West.
That's curious.
Good shot, Harry.
I didn't know my father.
I didn't even know
I had a father.
Now I've found and lost him all in one letter.
I guess you're an orphan,
Brother Eli, like us.
At least he's a rich one.
Only when we are giving,
Brother Marcus.
Of course, that's what you meant to say.
Oh, sure.
How rich are you gonna be?
Well, it appears that there is a considerable inheritance.
It mentions land and there is a town, and it says, ‘A considerable amount of money.’
Ha ha ha.
Imagine the good work we could do with that kind of wealth.
I guess you'll be out there a long time.
Just long enough to claim my inheritance, and then we'll be back.
You mean we're going with you?
Brother Demetrius says it might help your education.
Yahoo!
Out with the cowboys and the guns and the shoot-outs!
No, Brother Marcus, not in my father's town, no.
Remember, whosoever seeks peace and love shall find it.
If you have more dreaming to do, do it with your eyes shut.
We've got a long journey tomorrow. God bless.
- God bless.
- God bless.
ALL: 1, 2!
Whoo-hoo!
You have a go at me now, Sam.
Oh, thank you, Billy.
Thank you.
Hold it!
Easy, Billy.
We know you're grievin'.
- We ain't lookin' for trouble.
- Well, you found it.
Next time, it won't be your hardware.
It'll be your head.
Aw, quit shakin', Doc!
You made me miss.
I'm sorry, Billy.
I'm sorry.
Set 'em up again, Red Dog.
What's up, Ragsdale?
I'd like a little privacy.
You, come inside.
Wonder what he's gonna do when he finds out he's got a brother.
Don't worry about a brother that ain't gonna show up.
How's that?
Boys, you got a job to do.
[Cows mooing]
ROXANNE: Marcus, look.
Something's coming.
MARCUS: Yeah.
It's a stagecoach.
The kind that gets held up.
I hope not.
Don't worry.
That's why the armory is riding shotgun.
Eli, the stagecoach is here!
[Whistling]
Yah! Yah! Go on!
Get goin', now!
Yah! Yah! Hah!
Come on, now!
Whoa!
Hey, you, there.
Shake a leg.
We ain't got all day, you...
You can take as long as you want, Billy.
Just say the word, and you got all day.
I beg your pardon?
You ain't gonna get a quarrel outta us.
See?
He dropped his gun.
Does this stagecoach go to Bloodshy, please?
You bet your sweet life it does.
Anyplace you say.
Bloodshy, Carson City,
Timbuktu.
You name it, and that's where we're goin'.
We got nothin' but time.
There ain't no passengers to bother ya.
I'd be obliged if you could store that for me, please.
Okay.
Thank you.
And that one.
I'll be back in a jiffy.
You just take your time.
Wild Billy's talkin' peculiar, ain't he?
Probably liquored up from grievin'.
Should we make a run for it?
I don't know.
He probably got 'em hid under that coat.
Right, driver.
We're all in now.
Yes, sir.
Hooo!
[Whistles] Ho!
Let's go!
Yah! Yah!
Come on, now!
People sure seem polite around here.
They even call you by your first name.
Even if it's the wrong one.
I've noticed.
‘Billy.’
I wonder why.
Hah hah! Come on, there!
[Whistles]
Hah! Get along, there!
Hah!
Go on, now!
Get along! Hah!
[Whistles]
Hey, get outta there!
Ho! Ho!
Ho, there!
Ho!
Ho, there!
Hey, you, there!
Get that thing outta the way!
Sure.
But first we got a little business.
Boys!
We ain't carryin' gold.
No, but you got a passenger we want.
- You want him?
- Good luck.
Yeah.
I had a feelin' we might need this.
You! Inside!
Come on out!
We got a surprise for ya!
What's he doin' out here?!
Heh. You kinda took us by surprise.
Another one of your jokes,
Billy? Ha ha ha!
[Forced laughter]
Guess this one's on us.
We come all the way out here and find out it's you.
I don't know who you are or who you think I am.
But I do know you shouldn't point that.
It's liable to go off and hurt somebody.
MARCUS: Get down!
- Run for it!
- Out of my way!
Move it!
Run!
Let's go in the hills!
Why, he's crazy!
Let's get outta here!
Wow!
That was awful!
Did I tell ya?
Our first day in the West, and we've already been held up.
We better take this thing with us.
We don't want it to fall into the wrong hands.
I'm so tired,
I can hardly walk.
Don't worry. When we go through the Badlands, you'll be running.
We don't run, we walk.
Head high, Brother Marcus.
By holding good thoughts and relying on the power within us, our burden shall be lifted.
Do you remember that prophet of old, Elijah?
A man of righteousness and goodness.
He was sent to his final victory, his eternal destination, in a fiery chariot.
WOMAN:
Whoa! Whoa there!
Whoa! Whoa, boy!
Whoa! Whoa, there!
Look out!
Are you all right?
Yes. These critters seem to have a mind of their own.
What are you doing in the middle of the road?
We were just walking along.
Are you gonna stand there babbling or help me?
We'll help.
Give the lady a hand.
The fiery chariot.
I imagine you could use a lift.
Thank you.
Where are you going?
As far as Bloodshy.
So are we.
First the fiery chariot, and now she's taking us to Bloodshy.
See? You don't have to run if you listen to Brother Eli.
There.
Thank you.
Hey, I'm Jenny Willingham.
Are you a dance-hall girl?
Marcus.
No, I'm a schoolteacher.
How do you do?
I'm Eli Bloodshy.
We're missionaries.
That's Roxanne, and this is Marcus.
- Bloodshy, huh?
- It was my father's town.
He passed away, but I'm going to collect my inheritance.
Now, am I just gonna stand here or get that lift?
‘Put me down,’ I said!
Put me down!
Oh, Mansbridge.
Field, sir.
Oh, yeah.
What can I do for you,
Fieldbridge?
It's Mansfield, sir.
Oh, yeah.
Well, them English names are all Greek to me.
[Clang]
You wanna watch it there?
I'll turn your overnight stay into a life sentence.
You gotta keep your eye on 'em so they don't fly the coop.
We had a little fire in here thanks to Mr. Wild Billy.
One of these days, I'm gonna put the cuffs on him for good.
If you don't mind, sir,
I'm looking for Mayor Ragsdale.
Mr. Bloodshy's will.
Well, if it has to do with law, you came to the right place.
It's to be administered by the mayor.
Leave it to me, Mainstream.
[Clears throat]
Now, you remember you're on your honor!
‘I, Jasper Bloodshy, last will and testament, my entire inheritance...’
It's a contest.
It is?
No, it isn't.
It isn't?
Not when the other contestant can't make it.
Why can't he make it?
Because the poor sucker's on his way...
Sheriff, don't you have anything better to do?
No, not now.
Go out and find Wild Billy.
Wild Billy?
Tell him it's official.
He's rich.
Wild Billy?
It's good news, Sheriff.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Good news.
Then maybe he won't want a shoot-out.
I'll tell him.
Very rich.
ELI:
Isn't it beautiful, children?
All you can see for miles.
[Caws]
MARCUS: Look at that.
ELI: Bloodshy.
It's my name etched in wood.
So, where will you be staying?
How about the saloon?
Children can't stay at a saloon.
Why not? We're used to places like that.
And there's a lot of souls to save there.
I've made arrangements at a boardinghouse.
I'm sure they'll have room for you.
- Thank you very much.
- A boardinghouse?
That's not where all the shooting and fighting is.
99.9% of all towns in the West are peaceful little villages where nothing ever happens.
Get all that other stuff out of your head, hmm?
[Gunfire, explosions]
[Neighing]
Wow!
Hah!
Hah!
Whoa!
I think we're here.
I don't believe it.
Ohh!
[Coughing]
Oh, uh, sorry.
Mr. Bloodshy, are you all right?
I think so, yes.
Step aside!
Oh!
Ooh!
[Whistles]
Why, you...
Sorry.
[Coughing]
Stop, thief!
Get that varmint!
- Where is he?!
- I didn't see him.
There he goes.
Get down!
Get down!
You sidewinder!
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Just a minute!
Just a minute!
Do you mind?
Thank you.
This is no way to solve a problem.
If a man is guilty of a crime, he should be judged in a court of law, not by mob rule and violence.
[All muttering in agreement]
- Yeah, sure.
- Whatever you say.
Just because these men are mean, it doesn't mean they won't listen to reason.
Now, can you tell me where the sheriff is?
I've got something for him.
There he goes again!
He's gone crazy!
Outta my way!
Maybe we'll find him in the saloon.
No, not we.
Me.
You're off to the boardinghouse with Miss Willingham.
- Aw, Eli.
- Jenny.
Besides, you two could use a nap.
Good idea.
Eli, we're too old to take a nap!
Give us a break!
[Piano music plays]
Yo!
Get up here!
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah, me and Wild Billy are just like that.
Leastways, we're gonna be.
I got some news that's gonna keep him in booze, babes, and...
Sheriff?
- Billy, don't shoot!
- Pardon?
I got good news!
We got the will.
I seen it myself in black and white.
I cross my heart and hope to die.
Oh, Billy, no.
Let's just check that cannon, okay?
Thank you very much.
One of man's most destructive weapons.
What are you doin' in that crazy suit?
That's all right.
You can wear what you want.
You can do what you want.
You own the town, the land, the money, the land as far as the eye can see.
You're rich, Billy!
Rich!
It's almost too good to be true.
I thought that'd soften you up.
Don't forget,
I'm the one who told you.
[Man talking indistinctly]
Sheriff,
I think I know those men.
Well, I think it's time for a round of drinks.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
What'll you have?
A cup of tea, please.
[Laughter]
- I've sent for the tea.
- Thank you very much.
- BILLY: Yeeeee-ha!
- [Gunshots]
Outta my way, you varmint!
If you wasn't right here,
I'd swear that sounds like you.
[Indistinct yelling]
Yeeeee-hoooo!
MAN:
Now there's two of 'em!
Liven it up! Yeah!
Yeeeeee-hooooo!
He looks just like a real gunfighter.
I don't think we know him as well as we thought.
Yeah! Yeah!
Hah!
This saloon is deader than Boot Hill!
Party needs livenin' up.
That's Eli over there.
Twins?
Twin brothers!
Isn't that wonderful?
What's this?
[Gunshot]
I thought I shot out that mirror!
Don't fire.
No.
[Breathing heavily]
Holy smoke.
The mirror's talkin' to me.
I'm not a mirror.
No.
I don't like this.
How come there's two of me?
I said, ‘How come there's two of me?’
Hold it, Billy.
There ain't two of you.
There's one of each.
Brothers, spittin' images.
Brothers?
Oh, isn't that marvelous?
I'm overjoyed.
Well, I don't need no spittin' image!
Hold it, Billy!
Hold it!
Now, we got us a brand-new will.
Now, it mentions the fact that you got a brother, but it don't say nothin' about him bein' a twin.
Well, I don't need no brother, nor no spittin' twin!
Like it or not, want it or not, need it or not, you got him!
Just whose side are you on,
Mayor?
Oh, Mayor Ragsdale?
- Uh, yes.
- Eli Bloodshy, sir.
I've got a letter asking me to look you up regarding my inheritance.
Your inheritance?
Now, not so fast.
Now, how do we know he's a real Bloodshy?
You talk funny, like a foreigner.
Well, I've got my birth certificate.
I've got my license to drive a cart in Philadelphia.
And I'm expecting my preaching permit any day now.
Oh, Lordy, it ain't bad enough
I got me a brother.
He's a tambourine whacker!
[Laughter]
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, Eli.
Eli, sir.
Yes, Eli.
Yes, we do have an inheritance, but there's a little contest involved.
What kind of a contest?
Between the two of you.
It's spelled out right in here.
Yes, in detail.
Uh, yes.
There it is.
‘Winner take all.’
Between him and me?
Ha!
[Laughter]
What does it consist of?
Oh, just a little race.
[Laughing] Nothin' to be worried about.
You come on now, Eli.
Let me show you the town that your daddy built.
I'll see you later, Billy.
A little race, huh?
On the Bloody Bloodshy Trail.
Well, if'n I was you boys,
I'd get a few bets down in the big city.
That a way, whilst I'm cleanin' up on the psalm singer, you boys can be cleanin' out Reno!
- Yooooo-hooooo!
- [Gunshots]
That's the Bloodshy
Savings Bank.
Hasn't been open since the last robbery.
There's not much money in this town, parson.
I thought my father had considerable wealth.
Yes. It's all safe and sound in my vault there.
Don't you worry about a thing, son.
The lunchroom's shot, too?
People around here seem to get what they need in the saloon.
So I see.
It's the West, you see, son?
It's the wild, wild West.
Hold it.
He's here.
Who?
He is.
Rattlesnake.
But don't worry.
It's gonna be all right.
I got the edge on him.
You do?
Why?
Because he's here, and he knows I know he's here.
But he doesn't know I know he knows I know he's here, but I know.
So I got the edge.
Let's leave this up to the sheriff, son.
You're here.
I know you're here.
Yeah, I'm here, all right.
My sister says you insulted her.
No man insults my sister and stays alive.
Insulted her?
I asked her to marry me.
So, she was right.
Get ready to slap leather.
Then get ready to bite the dust.
[Laughing]
You're fast, Denver, but not that fast.
Nobody's that fast.
I didn't get to be the sheriff of Bloodshy for being slow.
Draw and I'll tattoo your name all over that sheet.
You draw and there'll be another badge on Boot Hill.
We'll see about that.
At the count of three.
[Chuckling]
Aah! Oh!
[Chuckling]
Whahh!
Uh, uh!
It seems what hasn't been burnt down has been boarded up.
I hope the church survived.
No. The church burned down about six months ago.
The church as well?
Perhaps I can speak to your minister.
Well, yeah. You probably passed him on the way into town.
All we passed was a little cemetery.
That great big gray tombstone?
That was him.
You beginning to get the picture, boy?
It's the classic picture of a town on its knees.
Yes, exactly.
Exactly.
Even if you do win that race, look around you here.
- What have you got?
- What have I got?
I've got the most marvelous opportunity a man could have.
Thank you for the most inspiring walk of my life.
What?
Jenny?
In here.
Jenny, fate took us by the hand when it led us out here.
Everywhere you turn, there's a golden opportunity.
What are you doing?
Packing.
It goes along with leaving.
Which is what
I'm going to do.
But there's a real job to be done here.
What job? The school burnt down six months ago.
All the more reason we're needed.
To start a fire department?
To build a new church, to build a new school, to lift this town to its feet, Jenny.
I believe that destiny has spoken to us.
Did destiny tell you where the money was coming from?
- My inheritance.
- What about the race?
The race?
You've heard about that?
It's all over town.
The kids told me.
Considering the life my brother's leading,
I'll be taking unfair advantage.
You don't think you stand a chance to win, do you?
When you're a missionary in Philadelphia, you get to be fast on your feet.
How are you in the water?
When was the last time you shot the rapids?
And how about the six-up team?
Have you driven one?
- I've never driven one.
- Then there's the mountain.
Have you ever climbed straight up 2,000 feet with razor-sharp rocks and death at every turn?
Is that what you think this race is all about?
That's it exactly.
Half of the people are betting you won't come out alive.
That's ridiculous.
You've been listening to rumors and a couple of kids.
Mayor Ragsdale assures me it's nothing more than a plain, simple, ordinary race.
You don't believe him, do you?
Of course. He's a fine, upstanding gentleman.
I like that.
He's a civic dignitary, you know.
But...
Oh.
He must not finish that race, but you gotta make it look like an accident.
I don't know what you're head-up about.
Ain't no way that city dude can make that course.
Well, there's too much at stake to take any chances.
There's something about him that makes me nervous.
Do you boys think that you can handle it this time?
Quit your worrying, Ragsdale.
Takin' care of an hombre like
Eli is our meat and potatoes.
Good. I'll have some gravy for you later.
[Sizzling]
Dinner in a moment, sir.
Try servin' it up here, you overpaid import!
And close your mouth, less'n you're aimin' to catch flies.
If I may, sir, what are you doing up there?
I'm spyin' on you,
Mansfield, to make sure you delivered the will.
Perhaps you were able to get a glimpse of Master Eli.
I would have if'n you hadn't let me climb up here without my spyglass.
Begging your pardon, but I wasn't here.
That's no excuse, you lint-headed limey!
Now look alive!
I'm comin' down!
Very good, sir.
Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh!
Are you quite all right, sir?
[Spitting]
Now I've had it with you,
Mansfield.
You missed me again, just like your broken-down neck did at the gorge.
Accidentally,
I assure you, sir.
Bourgeois.
If'n you don't kill me by missin' me, you're gonna get me with your poison cookin'.
Well, the stage is now set, sir, and we patiently await the opening curtain.
Don't give me that highfalutin lingo, you shoddy Shakespeare!
Now, what's my boy look like?
As you would say,
‘The spittin' image of your other son,’ sir.
Totin' guns, was he?
Yes. Rather a large rapid-firing one, sir.
Another fightin' fool.
Oh, great glory.
I can see a real battle shapin' up, Mansfield.
Under your watchful eye,
I'm sure it will be a marvelous contest.
Do sit down, sir.
Oh, thank you kindly.
Ah! Ooh!
With you around, Mansfield, my watchful eye may be the only thing left in my body that ain't broke, battered, or busted.
Revival meeting, ma'am.
A pamphlet, sir?
Singin', preachin', and free soup?
- It's homemade.
- Yes.
Free booze, and you might get yourself a crowd.
But free soup?
[Laughing]
Maybe some of the farmers will come.
I sure hope someone does.
I hope those gunfighters don't come.
I don't care what Ragsdale says.
If I had my way, that preacher wouldn't make it to the starting line.
They mean Eli.
He'd never believe that.
He's always looking at the good side of people.
But while he's looking at their good side, their bad side's gonna finish him.
What we oughta do is try to help protect him.
Look!
Five paces, we turn and shoot.
Right.
What about it?
That's a way to help protect him.
How?
Just wait.
You ready?
I'm ready.
You ready?
I'm ready.
You ready?
I said I was ready.
You gonna count, count.
All right.
I'm gonna count now.
Well, count!
Whhaaahhh!
[Growls]
[Gun cocks]
[Gunshot]
[Gun cocks]
[Gunshot]
[Gunshot]
[Gunshots]
Guns?!
What are you doing?!
Eli needs our help.
They're gonna get him.
I don't care. You have no business playing with guns.
- You want me to help unload it?
- Absolutely not.
Finish delivering those pamphlets. Now move.
You better be careful, Jenny.
The shotgun's still loaded.
Don't you worry about me.
Now, get a move on.
- All right.
- Yes'm.
[Sighs]
- ELI: Ah!
- Whoa!
Ow! Oh!
[Clattering]
Who... who did...
You! You.
You almost killed me!
Eli?
Are you crazy?
What are you doing shooting guns?
You don't understand.
Eli, I wasn't...
Well, if you wasn't, who was?
The children.
Jenny, don't blame the children.
It's bad enough to twist the truth, Jenny.
But to blame two innocent children for this.
I'm shocked.
You... you...
You wait and see.
When it comes to spottin' my son, this has to be the perfect spot, Mansfield.
Innocent children.
Innocent children.
Ah! Ohh!
[Thunder rumbling]
[Groans]
Hmm!
[Grunting]
[Chuckling]
[Thunder crashes]
[Thunder crashes]
All right, Rattlesnake!
None of your tricks this time!
On the count of three, draw!
Countin' three is fair by me.
So long, Denver.
[Chuckling]
[Chuckling mockingly]
[Rain falling]
[Thunder crashing]
- We're gonna be late.
- Jenny, let's go.
What's wrong, Jenny?
Aren't you going?
No, I don't think I will.
- Eli needs us, Jenny.
- It's his first revival meeting.
You'd do anything for him, wouldn't you?
Sure. He's done everything for us.
Maybe even more than a father would have done.
You'd like to have a father, wouldn't you?
More than anything else in the whole world.
Well, maybe I'll bring some soup down later on.
Come on.
No! I tell you, there is hope!
As Solomon told ancient Israel, the house of the wicked shall be overthrown, but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.
A real battler?
You nincompoop!
My son's a psalm singer!
Yoooo!
Mr. Bloodshy.
You better get out while the gettin's good.
The last feller who came here talkin' tabernacles went out feet first.
- You remember that.
- Yeah.
But running away has never been the solution, not when there are kind, decent, peaceful people here who want to live in a community where there's love and goodness.
Looks like his brother and talks like his mother.
That poor milksop stands as much chance out here as a snowflake in the Sahara.
What about my father?
Rest his soul.
He practically built this town.
Practically?!
I cleared timber, drove nails, dug ditches!
What am I telling you for?
You English sissy!
But then he just sat around, let it all turn sour, let it fall into the wrong hands.
Now it's a town of gamblin', gunfightin', hard drinkin', and fast women.
Sounds pretty good to me.
[Chuckling]
But if a town changed for the worse, it could change for the better.
All it needs is faith, courage, and conviction.
I'm ready to stay right here and help you fight to get this town back again.
Well, I guess he does have a smidgen of spunk after all, for a prune picker.
- Mr. Bloodshy!
- Yeah? Ooh.
I'm afraid you won't be here long.
You ain't gonna finish that race.
You know why?
Because there isn't going to be any silly race.
What's he mean, no race?
If’n he cancels my race,
I'll cancel him!
I'm going across the street now and talk to my brother.
We'll split this inheritance and use the money to make this a town worth living in.
Behind those guns of his, there's a fine, decent human being.
[Laughter]
Mr. Bloodshy, do you really believe all that?
I certainly do.
Yes.
Well, you're as crazy as a coot.
He's as crazy as two coots.
Marcus will spread the word.
The whole town will be out there with love and kindness in their hearts.
Roxanne, ring those bells.
[Crowd murmuring]
I've heared enough,
Mansfield.
Now I don't have to hear anymore.
% % Oh, come to the church
in the nave% %
[Gunshots]
[Piano notes play]
[Singing continues]
[Gun cocks, gunshot]
[Notes playing]
% % Oh, come to the church
in the nave% %
% % No spot is so dear
to my child% %
Brother Billy, may I...
Brother Billy, may I suggest...
[Gunshot]
Brother Billy, may I suggest we put aside this contest and join our hands together for the benefit of the community?
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
You're a-feared to race me.
Certainly not, but I think it's silly for two grown men to compete with each other.
Now, if'n you don't run in that race tomorrow, you're nothin' more than I thought you was.
A yellow-bellied, lily-livered coward from the city.
Now you get outta here afore I'm obliged to blow your brains out.
[Singing continues]
But we still don't have this settled.
And I'm not leaving here until we do.
Oh, you're not, huh?
[Voice croaks] No.
[Laughter]
You ought to be more careful with that gun.
[Laughter]
Say good night to Brother Eli.
ALL:
Good night, Brother Eli!
[Laughter, gunshots]
[Singing continues]
Oh, Eli.
[Laughter]
We'll see you at the race tomorrow, Brother Eli.
That is, if you can get your creakin' carcass to the startin' line.
Whoo-hoo!
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't get away with that!
Marcus, stop.
BILLY:
Now you won't have to wash.
[Laughter]
When are you gonna realize they don't want us here?
But we are needed.
Eli, they're against you.
All of 'em are.
Just a minute.
You haven't lost faith, have you?
- Of course not.
- Not in you.
Five mighty tests of courage, skill, and strength.
Startin' with the iron donkeys, snortin' little piston-drivin' steam engines, and endin' up with the six-up teams.
Wagons pulled by six powerful horses.
You're gonna see fierce, spirited, untamed, wild-eyed...
You lookin' for me?
I'll tend to you later.
[Chuckling]
Anyway, folks, the finish line is in town.
And one more thing.
Oh, yeah, I get it. Right.
Be brief.
Well, to be brief, folks, stationed at each and every point, there will be an official selected by our impartial race committee to see that there's no hanky-pankying going on.
Morning, Oscar.
Snead.
Hey, $5 says the preacher don't make it to the canoes.
Officials ain't allowed to make bets.
So?
You givin' odds?
You name 'em, you got 'em.
Cat's cradles.
It better be.
[Groans]
Now, push, Mansfield.
Push. Push.
[Grunting]
Ooh, I knew it in my bones, Mansfield.
Fair race, my foot.
My boy Eli's gonna need help, and lots of it.
So I best get my tools.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[Groaning]
Stand fast, you cockeyed Cockney, you.
[Groaning]
Uh-oh.
- Ooh!
- I'm sorry.
There's one thing for sure.
Master Eli certainly has a chance with you around.
Sir?
Sir?
Oh, sir!
Oh, and something else
I forgot.
Before we start the race...
[Laughter]
On second thought, let's just start the race.
Bring up the iron donkeys.
What do you think that means?
I don't know.
Eli, we got somethin' for you.
For me?
Be careful.
Don't squash it.
It's for good luck.
In case you need any.
Oh.
Oh, it's beautiful.
MARCUS:
Eli, we know you can win.
Win? He'll be lucky if he stays alive.
Roxanne.
Do you mind just having a little faith?
Contestants, mount your engines!
Don't worry. I have nothin' to be afraid of.
[Whistles]
Cheer up, brother.
We both got somethin' to look forward to.
The town greetin' me and Saint Peter greetin' you.
[Laughter]
- Eli.
- Yes?
For luck.
And be careful.
Now, when you hear my gunshot, that's your signal to start the race!
Are you ready?
- Yes.
- Yeah!
[Click]
Hey, what's goin' on?
When are they gonna start this thing?
[Laughter]
We gonna wait around here all day?
Hey.
[Gunshot]
Uhh!
Eli, you're goin' the wrong way!
[Clattering]
Billy, what are you stoppin' for?!
Ooh!
Get out of the way!
Ooh!
Aah!
Waaah!
Get off me!
Get your foot off of my shoe!
Somebody get a loop on him!
- [Whistles]
- Oh!
Thank you very much.
Push!
Here we go!
Here we go!
Is this a race or a ring around the roundhouse?!
ROXANNE: Come on, hurry!
Get him on the track!
Let's go, Eli!
Go, Eli!
Go, Eli!
Yay!
What's going on?!
You're losin', that's what!
[Laughs]
Come on!
Get him!
Get! Get!
Snail foot!
We'll see you later, brother!
Come on!
[Gunshots]
[Whistling]
Uh-oh.
[Grunts]
Huh?
Aah!
Clear the road!
Clear the road!
[Barking]
[Snarling]
[Whistles]
[Coughing]
Aah!
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Hey, what's that?
Aw, it's just another Indian sacrifice.
What, a whole tepee?
Yep, looks like it.
What become of your brother?
Should've been here by now.
You get ahead of him?
I guess he's steamin' home, back to Philadelphia.
Holy horsefly!
Would you look who that is.
Now, how did he get there?
[Panting]
[Coughing]
You get back here, you schemin', cheatin' polecat!
You paddle like you talk!
Like a sissy!
Hey, Bloodshy!
Quitters don't run in our family!
Yee-aah!
Yah!
Aaah! Aah!
[Grunting]
Wrong way.
Wrong way!
[Panting]
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Aah! Aah!
Ohhhh!
Help!
[Spitting]
[Grunting]
[Spits, panting]
Aaah!
Looks pretty good for you,
Billy.
Yeah, and pretty bad for him.
Hey, look!
Am I seein' what I think I'm seein'?
I coulda told him this race would get him one way or tother.
[Spits, panting]
Well, looks like you might get your chance.
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.
You better get a wiggle on it.
That fella's still a-kickin'.
Come on, Bucky, let's help him out.
MANSFIELD:
Has he succeeded, sir?
JASPER: Has he?
I told you that half-drowneded church mouse is sure givin' him a run for it, in spite of them sabotagin' Sneads.
I daresay the Sneads aren't bright enough to be doing this dastardly deed on their own.
I'll do the daresayin'
'round here, Mansfield.
Oh, very good, sir.
Yeah, I daresay the Sneads don't seem bright enough to be doing this...
Dastardly.
...deed by themselves,
Mansfield.
- Excellent observation, sir.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we best get into town.
I got a hunch who the real schemin' skunk is.
Hop aboard.
Where am I going now?
Up the mountain, just as soon as you refresh yourself with a little water.
Water?
I'm a walking sponge right now.
And a cold one.
Don't matter.
One of the rules.
It's for the well-being of both contestants.
You saw Wild Billy take his, didn't you?
Well, if Billy...
Mountain water.
[Shivers] I've never...
I've never tasted water like this before.
That's the funniest stuff
I've ever had.
Mmm, mmm.
[Gulps]
You know, it's...
It's not bad.
It certainly got rid of those shivers.
[Shivers]
[Slurring] You know...
I kinda like it.
[Sniffs]
A man ought to drink water more often.
I liked visitin' with you, but you better catch Billy.
You gentlemen mind if I take this little old water jug?
Why, I think that'd be all right.
- Sure.
- Good.
Hey, mister!
That's not the mountain.
That's the river.
Oh, that's right, yes.
The mountain and the river.
The mountain.
I'll start right on up.
Yeah.
‘Eli groggy.’
[All cheering]
‘But right behind
Wild Billy.’
[All booing]
You think Eli can win?
Against a stacked deck?
We better find out what they're up to.
RAGSDALE: If you don't get that preacher on the mountain, make sure you get him at Devil's Gorge.
I told you, quit worryin'.
Ain't no possible way he can get by the gorge.
That's good.
All right, here's the gravy that I promised you.
After you get rid of that psalm singer...
Pay attention!
We're plannin' a little dynamite party for Wild Billy at Deadman's Pass.
- Wild Billy?
- Yep.
You want to get rid of Wild Billy, too?
I don't know.
You see,
I've doctored that will.
You see, if nobody wins, then the money and the saloon, the town goes to the executor of that will, and that's me.
Now, you and your brothers, being my partners, why, you'll get, uh, uh... half.
Well, now do you want to bump off Wild Billy?
[Laughs evilly]
Does a coyote like to howl?
Here's where you're gonna come down the trail.
Right there.
That's where you put the dynamite, there.
Got it.
Okay.
This is gonna be a cinch.
All right, now let's go.
Come on.
[Gun cocks]
Sir!
Let go, Mansfield!
They're gonna get my sons!
Over my dead body.
But, sir, there must be another way of handling this.
Would you take your hands off... ow!
- [Gunshot]
- [Neighing]
Where have you two been?
They're gonna get
Brother Eli!
Hyah!
- Whoa! Whoa! What?
- Wild Billy, too!
With dynamite at Deadman's Pass.
Wait a minute.
We don't have time for you not to believe us.
I'm going with you.
Hyah!
Good goin', Billy.
You made it.
Well, what did you expect?
I always figured you'd be first...
- [Eli singing in distance]
- Hold it!
Can you hear somebody singin'?
Yeah. Real pretty.
It's that blasted bulldog.

Now!

Oh!
Wonder where they came from.
The biggest hailstones
I've ever seen.
Boy, he's slipperier than a dad-gum snake.
[Groans]
Mmm. Mmm.
Ahh.
This has got to do it.
- I'll tell you when.
- Right.
[Coughs]
Okay!
[Grunting]
Ahh.
Ohhh.
The world trembles at your beauty.
Don't tell me we missed him again.
We'll get him.
At the gorge.
That's the way!
Keep it up!
You're doing terrific!
Congratulations, Billy.
Why, with the lead you've got, you could let them horses ride you and still win.
That stall-fed tenderfoot got no business being in the race.
But he hasn't come by yet.
So you don't have anything to worry about.
Wha...
Hello, Billy!
Now, how does that him-hummer keep a-doin' it?
The team's just up the hill!
That's the skinniest-looking bridge I've ever seen.
Ooh!
Yee-haw!
Eli, what are you doin'?
Not that-a way!
Hand over hand!
You mean...
Yeah!
Hand over hand!
[Gasps]
[Wind gusting]
No!
You don't understand!
You don't have to walk on 'em!
Oh!
Come on!
You can make it!
No, he can't!
Aaah!
Hey, preacher!
How do you like the view?
[Laughing]
This is no time to be lyin' down on the job!
[Laughing]
Help!
Yeah, boys, help him out!
[Laughs]
What do you think you're doing?!
After you.
Aaah! Aah!
[Laughter]
Go on, get that other surprise ready up at Deadman's Pass.
This hombre's a goner.
- Okay, boss.
- You bet.
[Panting]
Whoa!
% % Rock of ages% %

Come on, we've got work to do.
You ain't never gonna make it, preacher!
Ah!
[Panting]
Take a long look down and say your last prayer, preacher!
[Laughs]
Amen and adios!
Oh!
There's nothin' like a well-aimed rock, Mansfield.
Unh!
Oh! Ah!
Eli!
If only
I could help you, son.
Eeh! Ooh!
Mansfield, have you gone plum loco?
Aaah! Ohh!
MARCUS: Get him, Roxanne!
Hit him! Hit him!
Ohh! Oh!
Good!
We did it.
Yeah!
He went over easier than I thought.
He sure did.
Look!
Oh, no!
Hang on, Eli!
Aaaaaah!
- Eli!
- Eli!
Hurry! Hurry!
Oh, thank heaven.
[Panting]
Hang on, Eli!
Yeah, hang on!
We'll save you!
[Branch cracks]
Aaah!
Help me up.
Quick, Jenny, the rope!
- [Branch cracks]
- Aaah!
Aah!
Here, Eli!
All right, hit him.
- Hyah!
- Go on! Go!
Hyah!
Aah, aah, aah, aah!
Aah! Aah!
Oh!
ROXANNE: Let go, Eli!
Eli, let go!
Aaah!
Is he all right?
Wow, that mountain water sure makes you do funny things.
Ragsdale's in it with the Sneads!
They're out to get Billy, too.
If both of you don't make it,
Ragsdale gets everything.
You gotta win!
The only thing I've got to do is save my brother.
This map shows the dynamite and where the Sneads are gonna be.
You'll lose the race to save someone who hates you.
Well, isn't that what we're supposed to do?
Help anybody who needs saving, hmm?
Yeah.
I guess so.
Come on.
Come on!
[Sighs]
Come on!
Hey, you two, wait for us!
Tallyho.
Gee-up.
Give me those!
[Whistles] Hyah!
Aah! Oh!
MARCUS: Look out!
Everybody, in the back!
Quickly!
[Bird calling]
Hey, is everybody all right?
MARCUS: Yeah, Jenny.
[Spitting]
Eli, look at that.
Yeah, what is it?
ROXANNE:
It's those Sneads.
Yeah.
[Horse snorts]
You see anything?
No, no sign of him yet.
The lookout has the rifle.
Eli can handle him.
I hope so. We've got to get him away from that plunger.
If he falls on it, the whole mountainside will go.
- I got an idea.
- Oh, really?
You get behind that rock.
Right.
Stay here.
I'll be right back.
Now cover it up.
All right.
Unh!
Why, you little dad-gum cotton-pickin'...
Now!
Aah!
Billy!
Get back!
Get back!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Let go of my hair!
Get off of me, you little pony!
Just keep him buttoned up.
Billy!
[Birds calling]
- Pete, get on that plunger.
- Yeah, boss.
Did he hear him?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
[Muffled grunting]
Ain't a bad swap, huh?
Two brothers for a fortune.
[Grunting continues]
Git!
Hey, he's a-movin'!
When he gets to the mine, they both get it.
[Muffled] No! No!
Shall I help you steady the rifle, sir?
Only when I decide to aim it at you, Mansfield.
[Gun cocks]
PETE: He's getting pretty close, boss.
BOSS SNEAD:
All right, get ready.
Should I blow it now?
No.
Not yet.
Ready?
- Unh!
- Aah!
Billy! Dynamite!
Get him!
Get down!
Oh!
Where is he?!
- Oh!
- Oh!
[Roxanne and Marcus cheering]
JENNY:
Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!
I got him, Eli!
I got him!
You?
It was Jenny.
I don't think it was me.
I think it was the...
Oh, no!
Uh, I don't know what that was, folks.
It could have been thunder.
But one thing I do know.
A winner could be coming in any minute now.
Oh, Eli.
I've got to find out.
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Are you just gonna stand there caterwaulin' all day?
Thank heaven you're safe.
I might have knowed it.
Never trust a Bible-banger.
[Sniffs]
You went and ruined everything.
What?
The will says,
‘May the best man win.’
Now I ain't so sure
I am the best man.
You saved my life!
Now, how am I gonna whip a man who saves my life?
Billy, Ragsdale set us both up to be killed, and he's going to get all the money if nobody wins.
Ragsdale?
That snivelin' sneak!
Then one of us has gotta win.
[Cheers and applause]
Thank you, Sheriff.
Thank you, thank you, boys.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all my loyal constituents.
Now, then, as executor of the estate of the late, great, beloved Jasper Bloodshy...
[Crowd muttering]
I was fully prepared to turn over his entire, every last cent of that fortune to whichever brother wins, whichever one comes in.
[Crowd cheering]
But, uh...
Well, it seems to me that if there is to be a winner, he should have been here a long time ago, hmm?
Matter of fact, it has occurred to me, as I am sure it has occurred to each and every one of you, that some unforeseen, dire tragedy has befallen those two fine young men, huh?
[Crowd murmuring]
Let's take him, too.
No, no, come on.
However!
However, there is a, uh, provision in the will which states that if there is no winner, then the entire fortune goes to...
Rider comin'!
A rider comin'.
Rider comin'?
Who is it?
Can you see?
I don't believe it!
Are you sure that's the preacher?
[Laughs excitedly]
It's Eli!
He's won!
[Cheering]
Whoa!
You're safe!
How's Billy?
Eli, we knew you could do it!
Where's Ragsdale?!
ROXANNE:
There he goes!
MARCUS: With as much money as he can get away with.
Hold it, Ragsdale!
Hyah, hyah!
Go on! Get out of here!
Move it! Hyah!
Get out of here!
Hey, Eli, you're shootin' just like Wild Billy.
Come back here, you consarn, yellow-bellied, lily-livered, two-timin' polecat!
Yah!
Eli isn't Eli.
Eli's Wild Billy.
Another rider comin'!
- Which one's this?
- Is it Eli or Billy?
Now, there's Eli.
I think.
Brother,
I'd like a word with you.
I said, ‘Brother,
I'd like a word with you.’
Later!
Swing me up!
Aah!
[Laughter]
I'm ready, Rattlesnake.
Let's make it clean and fast.
All right.
We'll count to three.
I'm gonna get you, Ragsdale!
Marcus, what are you doing?
Oh, no!
Hey, what is this?
Get that off!
I don't see any way you can trick me this time.
[Chuckling]
Get off me!
What is this thing? Get away!
Get off!
Get off!
- Aah!
- Ooh!
Aah! Aah!
Hold on!
Come on, get him!
Get him, Eli!
He's a crook!
He's got all the money!
Look out!
Tarnation!
Marcus, are you all right?
That was great!
What?
Here he comes, Mansfield!
The dirty fly into the spider's web.
Stand back, Mansfield, and see how the West was won.
Ehhh! Ooh!
MANSFIELD: Oh, sir!
Great jumpin' Jasper's ghost!
Aaah!
Ohh!
Aah! It's a ghost!
It's a ghost!
I can't be seein' this.
I know I'm not seein' this.
- But get off me!
- Nothing doin', Ragsdale!
I'm takin' you with me!
I take everything back!
I'll give you the money back!
Too late, you whinin' weasel!
I'll see you in jail if it's the last thing
I ever do-o-o!
It was the old man,
I tell you! I saw him!
I tell you, it was the strangest thing I ever saw.
He came floatin' down in a white sheet.
The bats have taken over the belfry.
You gotta believe me!
Hey, Sheriff!
Listen, you start that story one more time, there'll be two ghosts, and you'll be one!
I'll be late for that ceremony.
Deputy, keep an eye on the prisoners.
Right, chief.
Deputy?
You gotta believe me, man!
[Cheers and applause]
And so my brother and I have decided to share the money and use it to make a new town.
A town a whole lot different than the one you've been used to.
And if anybody has any other ideas, they're gonna have to answer to m...
[Clears throat]
My brother, Eli.
[Laughter]
It's going to be a town
I hope you'll all be proud of.
I know I'm going to be proud of the new church and the new school we're building.
A new school for our children, yours and mine.
He means us.
We've got a father.
And I'll tell you something else.
Not only will these children have the best teacher, they'll have the prettiest one they've ever seen.
[Laughter and applause]
Of course, I may be a little prejudiced.
I think we're gettin' a mother, too.
[Cheering]
You know,
I can't rightly recollect ever seein' the whole town together with folks a-smilin' at each other instead of shootin'.
[Crowd murmuring in agreement]
I think this is a fitting moment now to pay tribute to the one man who made all this possible.
Our father, Jasper Bloodshy.
It's too bad he couldn't have lived to see his last wish come true.
Amen, brother.
But if you'll all join in with me now singing ‘Something Good is Bound to Happen,’
I guarantee no matter where he is, he'll be happy at this very moment.

It's time to move on.

Cactus Ridge.

NARRAToR: This place used to be known
as Bidancoje Canyon...
...after some Indian feller.
The first city council we ever had
decided to change the name to Santa Rosa.
Reckoned it was more dignified.
Can't say as how it made
a lot of difference.
There's a fella from the government
came by a while back...
...said we got 2406 folks living here.
I mean, you know, what with people dying
and new kids being born.
Damned if I know how he figured that out
from one day to the next.
Come to think of it, about the only thing
that makes Santa Rosa...
...any different from the other towns
in these parts is our sheriff.
In the first place, he's a foreigner.
An Irishman, which isn't
anything against him of course...
...but it sure gives him
a funny way of talking.
Another thing unusual about him,
he's never shot anybody.
KILPATRICK: Okay, Kevin, off you go.
Give it plenty of air. Go on.
Now, let it go. Good boy.
Here, I'll show you.
You gotta aim it very high...
...and let it float over the object it's gonna drop on. All right?
You practice that and get that right and I promise you...
...you can rope yourself a mustang, kill a snake...
...or pull a little doggy out of a bog hole.
That's a lot more than you can do with a gun.
[WINDING BARREL]
BRAND:
You know something? It's shocking.
The price of ammunition's a goddamn disgrace.
[LAUGHS]
CHoo CHoo: Maybe we better go down to that hardware store...
...and give them a taste of my rail.
[ALL LAUGHING]
KATHERINE: Kilpatrick, leave the boy alone.
'Tis time for school.
KILPATRICK: A little homework won't do him any harm. He's coming right in.
Go on to mind your mother.
Give it one more.
Plenty of air, let it swing, now let it go. Good boy.
[CLAPS]
BRAND:
There she is. Ride in real slow.
Choo Choo takes care of the horses.
And Schoolboy and Jacob and me just wander on inside.
Jacob, now, when I say something, you listen to me, you nigger son of a bitch.
JACoB:
I'm listening, Mr. Brand.
[LAUGHS]
BRAND: Remember, anyone gets in your way, kill them.
Pretty town, real pretty.
CHoo CHoo: Pretty town your ass.
It's that pretty money we want.
KEvlN:
Can I take the lariat with me to school?
KILPATRICK: Of course you can.
Don't forget, you must keep practicing.
KATHERINE:
The boy should be tending his lessons...
...not indulging in a lot of tomfoolery with ropes.
KILPATRICK:
Do you want the boy to grow up useless?
KATHERINE: No, but I'd like him to have a proper head on his shoulders.
Not like his father.
KILPATRICK: Katherine, I think you're very beautiful, but you make no sense at all.
SARAH:
Good morning, sheriff.
KILPATRICK:
Good morning, Sarah. Fine morning it is.

KILPATRICK:
Bill, give me those handbills from Austin.
Bob, there are four strangers over there by Jack's wearing guns.
- Keep an eye on them.
BoB: Right.
BRAND: Jacob, will you stop counting that stuff and stash it away?
Let's get out of here.
TELLER:
You picked the wrong town, mister.
This is Kilpatrick's town.
KILPATRICK:
You better take the key.
BILL: See somebody you think you recognize?
KILPATRICK: No. That's what worries me.
TELLER: Do you realize your chances are very remote?
We have the best possible protection.
BRAND:
You really believe that, don't you?
TELLER:
I do indeed, sir.
BRAND:
Well, shit.
We ain't got a hell of a lot more to talk about, have we?
Goddamn it, I knew it.
Pesky, get that bell.
Bill.
[BELL RINGING]
Remember the plan. No shooting.
Frank, get over by the wagons.
Get the women and children safe.
Come on, now, get the town, boys.
Okay, boys. Get on the roof.
Keep down and no shooting.
BRAND:
Goddamn it, move. Move.
KILPATRICK:
Tom?
- Help with the wagons.
- Dan, no shooting.
Larry, on the roof, Larry.
Jake, keep those women inside.
Sam, get those children off the street.
Come on, Schoolboy.
Come on, goddamn it, move. Move.
Come on, Schoolboy.

I could've told him to blow your head off.
Bill.
BRAND:
Hey, you.
Sheriff, here in the schoolhouse.
Hey, mister.
We got you all boxed in.
We're not gonna shoot you down, not in my town.
We, uh...
We got your friends.
They're all alive.
Want us to show them to you?
I got something to show you.
I got me a little kid.
And I'll blow his head off unless you drop them guns.
No, wait.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You're not gonna kill that kid, are you?
If you make me squeeze this trigger...
...l'll blow him so wide apart ain't nobody gonna put him together again.
Drop the guns! Drop them!
Let us go quiet.
This is Kilpatrick.
Kilpatrick speaking.
I want you to take your guns...
...your gun belts...
...throw them into the center of the street.
You all hear me?
Drop them! Guns! Get out of there!
You too, Bill.
Please, Bill, please.
Bill, go to the center of the road...
...and make sure everybody's thrown their guns down.
So we can see them.
And get their horses, bring them right here.
And the saddlebags with the money.
Saddlebags with the money.
The saddlebags and the money, Bill.
Hi, kid. You all right?
Yeah.
- Good boy.
- Of course he's all right.
Good little kid.
You know something?
You were smart.
I heard you was a bright fella.
Kilpatrick, ain't it?
Yeah. Yeah, that's me. And you?
Brand.
Frank Brand.
I never knowed too many people'd call me by my first name.
Well...
...you win the pot.
Yeah, I knows you'd see it that way...
...Mr. Kilpatrick.
You really weren't gonna kill that kid, were you?
It's a goddamn good thing for him that you didn't try to find out.
Yeah.
Grab ahold of him.
Mr. Kilpatrick?
Schoolboy, give me that kid.
Hey, now, wait a minute.
I gave you my town.
I want that boy.
Just a little insurance, Mr. Kilpatrick.
I'll drop him off for you a little ways out of town.
Git.
Kevin!
Kevin!
Ma!
[WoMAN SCREAMS]
Katherine.
Oh, Katherine.
It's the boy, Katherine.
It's Kevin.
It's Kevin, you know.
Just wait.
I'll be right back.
I'm just going over to talk to our little boy.
Wait now.
[MAN SPEAKING IN LATIN]
Amen.
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come...
...thy will be done...
...on Earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses...
...as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation...

[PEoPLE SINGING
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY" SoNG]
KATHERINE: Come now, Sean,
after all, it's the boy's birthday...
...and he has his heart set on it.
KILPATRICK: Katherine,
I don't care if it's the boy's birthday.
KATHERINE: It's only a toy gun.
All little boys want toy guns.
KEvlN:
Why can't I have a gun, Daddy?
KILPATRICK: Because you can't reason
with a gun, Kevin.
I know it's hard for you to understand.
If you have a gun then
another person wants to have a gun...
...and then another and another.
And pretty soon,
everyone has to live with a gun.
And that's very, very bad.
We must not allow guns
to do our thinking for us.
KEvlN:
I don't want to hear anymore.
You're a mean Daddy
and I don't love you anymore.
[GUNSHoT]
BoB:
Looks like they made it into Mexico.
BILL: They're two, maybe three hours ahead of us. Wanna notify the Federales?
Sean, I said do you want to notify the Federales?
Sean?
Federales?
Federales, Sean. Mexico.
Mexico?
What are you talking about?
BILL:
Don't do it, Sean.
I'm asking you, don't go.
Take care of Katherine, Kevin, for me, will you?
[THUNDER RUMBLING]
BRAND:
Okay, let's haul ass out of here.
You like that hat, Schoolboy?
Every one of them bills is brand-new.
Every one of those bills are brand-new,
Mr. Brand.
Well, I just said, them sons of bitches is brand-new.
Deaf as a post, that nigger.
Come on, Schoolboy, you can't spend it here, you know.
Hat. New hat. Mine.
CHoo CHoo:
Yeah, yeah, I know, your hat.
BRAND: Come on, nobody gives a shit about his hat.
Come on, Jacob, let's get out of here.
We just can't leave him, Mr. Brand.

I can leave him. Come on, giddap, git.

GUTIERREZ:
I have been hunting Senor Brand...
...for a long time.
He is wanted here.
On suspicion for murder.
Suspicion?
You mean you don't know if that's the man you want?
He must be identified.
I have a witness.
Identified?
Oh, I can identify him, all right.
For the rest of my life I can identify him.
I saw him kill my wife.
Katherine.
He...
...shot the...

My son, Kevin.
He just...
...threw him under the horse's feet.
And the horses tromped him and tromped him...

- I'm sorry, senor.
I'm sorry for you.
But you have no authority here.
I'm gonna kill him.
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No.
No.
You do not kill him.
L...
I am going to catch him.
And bring him back for trial.
You are a sheriff, senor.
You know it is our job to catch such pigs...
...not to execute them.
You go home now.
I will catch him.
And I will send you word.
You'll do that?
I mean, you'll really do that?
On the life of my wife...
...and my child.
I'm Kilpatrick.
Santa Rosa.
[GRUNTS]
[LAUGHING]
Mama, get in there, get in there.
Watermelon. Well, I'll be goddamned.
Look at that.
I told you we'd find some food here.
JACoB: Not much here to eat.
- A nice juicy watermelon.
BRAND: What do you mean nothing here?
What do you call that?
BRAND: I gotta hand it to you, Choo Choo, you can use that hunk of rail of yours.
That hunk of rail there's a tribute to my daddy.
BRAND: How come?
- Like other folks got a tombstone.
It just happened that I couldn't find enough pieces to bury him...
...to give him a real honest-to-God tombstone, so I just...
I just got myself a piece here that killed him.
What'd he do, blow himself up?
A train wreck.
My daddy threw me clear...
...all I got was my hand here cut off.
Snorting train must have dragged my pappy 500 yards.
Next time it come through, there was a piece of rail missing.
[CHoo CHoo LAUGHING]
Did I ever tell you about my daddy?
Well, when I was a yearling...
...I was 15 years old.
Because my mama done give me a pair of them cavalry boots.
They was about that high and blue-black.
Anyway...
...my daddy's herd...
...little herd, come down with the hoof-and-mouth disease.
So, what you gonna do, you know? We dug a pit.
Dug a big hole and drop them all into it.
Shot them.
Anyway...
...I was standing there and I fell in the goddamn pit.
And my father laughed at me.
I shot him and I buried him with the cows.
But them boots, they stunk for a year.
Anyway, when anybody had ask me what my daddy died of...
...l'd say, "What, my daddy? My daddy died of hoof-and-mouth disease."
Hoof-and-mouth disease with a human being?
Hoof-and-mouth disease.
Hoof-and-mouth disease.
Don't you find that funny, nigger?
Well, Mr. Brand...
...I don't know if it's funny or not.
I don't even know who my father was.
I'll be a son of a bitch.
CHoo CHoo:
Why, it's that goddamn sheriff again.
JACoB:
He's right.
Hope he's still got the money with him.
He's crazy. That son of a bitch is crazy.
A hundred miles into Mexican territory and he's still playing sheriff.
He's a goddamn Yankee.
Don't care nothing about state's rights.
JACoB:
What are we gonna do about it?
Yeah, he is getting to be a pain in the ass.
Got me an idea.
Hey, senora.
I think you can be of service to us.
[HoRN BLoWS]
What? What the...?
I'm Kilpatrick. I'm sheriff of Santa Rosa.
I'm the sheriff of Santa Rosa.
Senor Sheriff, now he saying that he too is a lawman.
What kind of a lawman would shoot two old people like that...
...until his gun run out of bullets?
See, this fella's pretty stupid.
He don't realize that us Americans, when we come across the border...
...we do away with our badges of office.
That's out of respect to your authority.
What'd you think you was doing, fella?
Trying to fool all these simple people?
Because you got a little piece of tin on your chest?
See, in United States you can buy a toy like this just for a few pennies, a few centavos.
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
You don't have to talk to me because I'm a sheriff.
Just go and peek in his saddlebags.
I'll guarantee you he's got most of the money that he stole in Texas.
Brand.
You understand Mex., fella?
They're saying they're gonna hang you.
Hope it hurts like a son of a bitch.
Brand...
...for the rest of your life you'll remember this.
It was my wife...
...and my son you killed in my town.
Hang him.
GUTIERREZ: If you had not hit me so hard in the wrong place...
If you had not hit me so hard in the wrong place, senor...
...I would have been here sooner.
- Brand...
- He can't be too far.
I will go after him.
I come... I'll come with you.
No, no, no.
You stay here.
They will release you soon.
They will not try to hang you again.
Unless you complain about the food.
This is your food.
You still gonna bring him in alive?
After what he did to those...
...two old people?
You saw him kill them?
No one did.
Senor Gutierrez...
...when you catch him, if he's not identified by a witness...
...you gonna release him?
- That is the law.
- Senor Gutierrez...
...what's the name of your wife?
Martha.
And your children?
Pancho and Miguel.
And you're gonna set him...
...free?
[GUTIERREZ SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
You ain't finished yet?
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
Dumb asshole.
That blacksmith takes an hour for each goddamn shoe.
Ain't no hurry.
Hey, Jacob.
Get out the cards.
We got an hour before the shoe's ready over at the blacksmith's.
Why don't you have him fix your new hand while you wait?
CHoo CHoo: One of these days I'm gonna stuff this thing right down your throat.
- Come on, I wanna try it again.
- Try what?
The lady, the lady.
Oh, come on, I have no desire to take your money.
Well, you've already taken a goddamn thousand.
That's exactly what I mean.
Well, then give me a chance to get even.
All right. Okay.
- How much?
CHoo CHoo: Five hundred.
An ace.
Another ace.
The lady.
Now, this time try to concentrate, okay?
That one.
- That one?
- No, goddamn it, that one.
- Are you sure?
- You wanted me to pick the other one.
- You're bending the card.
- I won, didn't I?
You lose.
Why, you dirty, cheating bastard.
[MEN YELLING AND CHATTERING]
Damn it, will you cut out that bullshit?
We got ourselves some company.
You know who that is?
That's that son of a bitching
Mexican sheriff.
We get rid of one, now we got another.
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute, hold it.
He's been trying to take me for about six months.
I figure it's time I give him a chance.
I figure it's time.
There he is.
Look at that big old boy riding in.
Big old sheriff.
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
Let's hear it for him, just like I said.
Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip, hooray!
MEN: Hip, hip, hooray!
[GUNSHoT]
- Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip, hooray!

Just like old Uncle Frank taught you.
- Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip, hooray!
Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip, hooray!
Buenas tardes, jolly good fellow.
You're under arrest.
You know the charges.
BRAND: Oh, I don't wanna hear any more of them dreadful lies.
What I wanna know is, just the hell how are you gonna do anything about it?
I'm surrounded by my loving people.
[SCREAMS]
Oh, my eyes.
[WoMEN SCREAM]
BRAND:
Jacob, get the hell out of here.
Git, come on.
[KEYS RATTLING]
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
Father.
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
KILPATRICK:
Jailer.
Jailer!
Drop the gun.
Open the door and be quick.
Come on. Open the bloody door.
Get in.
May... May God forgive you.
Why wouldn't he?
That's his business, isn't it?
GUTIERREZ:
I have made the blacksmith my deputy.
He does not have any English...
...but he understands that if you try to get away...
...he is to kill you.
[GUNSHoT]
Goddamn,
I wish there was a bounty on sheriffs.
I wouldn't have to go around risking my ass robbing banks...
...carrying on, I'd take it.
Well, now we can take our time.
Nice and easy.
Hold him there.
Thank you, Jacob.
Hey, listen.
What was that you said back there...
...what you was gonna spend your money on?
You seem awfully interested in my money, Mr. Brand.
I just care what happens to my friends.
Like Schoolboy, Choo Choo?
You know, one of these days, Jacob...
...that old sense of humor of yours is gonna get you killed.
Git, come on.
Hah, hah, hah, hah!
CHoo CHoo:
Pretty rough going, huh?
What you need is a new pair of boots.
Real good ones, like the ones I got on.
Say, how much they paying you for this anyway, huh?
You, amigo, how much dinero they giving you...
...for taking me to San Ignacio, huh?
[BLACKSMITH SPEAKS
IN SPANISH]
CHoo CHoo: Why, that's terrible.
That's a goddamn disgrace.
How they expect you to buy all those things we've been talking about, huh?
Like horses and boots and girls.
Hey. Hey, amigo.
When was the last time you were laid, huh?
Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna treat you to a girl, a real muchacha.

Don't shoot.

- You're a liar.
- No, I'm not. It's San Jose.
[YELLS]
CHoo CHoo:
Help me, man. Help me.
For God's sake, help me.
- Where's Brand?
- San Jose.
- Why San Jose?
- He's got a girl there.
He's got a girl there.
I'm sorry about your kid.
[CHoo CHoo GRo ANS]
GUTIERREZ:
Kilpatrick.
Ki...
Kilpatrick.
KILPATRICK:
Can you wrap this around you?
WoMAN: Bastard. You are a bastard.
BRAND: Get out of my way.
WoMAN:
Bastard.
Get it finished.
We're getting the hell out of here.
I'm not going.
Three aces and a pair, gentlemen.
What did you say, nigger?
I said, I'm not going.
Frank.
Frank?
Frank.
Seems like everybody's stepping over the line, don't it, Jacob?
I thought we was partners.
Wanna tell me why you wanna break up a friendship?
You know that sheriff back in San Ignacio?
Well, the fellas around here say they didn't hang him.
He got away...
...and he's on our trail again.
But it's not me he's after, it's you he wants.
So I figure if we split up, it's your trail he'll follow, not mine.
Well, now...
...you're not gonna run out on me just because of an old Texas sheriff, are you?
I sure hate to lose you, Jacob.
Me or my money?
[LAUGHS]
Well, shit.
I guess when you get real deep down to it, it's the money.
All right.
I'll give you a chance to win some of this money.
What'll it be?
Stud poker, draw poker or Find the Lady?
Whoa, now, Jacob...
...if I found you was cheating me at cards,
I'd have to up and kill you, Jacob.
Got a business deal for you, though.
Remember you was talking about opening up a whorehouse?
- Give me a thousand dollars.
- What?
Give me a thousand dollars.
Jacob, you're gonna force me to draw on you?
- What for?
- Come on. I'll show you.
KILPATRICK:
Now tell me you fell off your horse.
I assume there were no witnesses. Right?
How did you get out of jail?
It was a small miracle.
Tequila?
Sî, tequila.
There we go.
Easy.
- Oh, come on.
- Is enough.
Is enough.
It's good for internal too.
Well, I can see that you're all right.
Brand?
I don't know.
KILPATRICK:
How long ago?
Six, seven hours.
Six, seven hours.
Well, let's get going.
I think I'll go back to San Ignacio.
See a doctor, huh?
You're coming with me.
If you think I'm gonna risk you telling your Federales...
...and having them swarming all over my neck, no, sir.
GUTIERREZ: Federales will be here soon anyway, my friend.
Already my deputy is on his way to Nuevo Magdalena with a prisoner.
He will bring the Federales.
You mean the man with the iron hand?
Well, you can forget about the Federales.
Because your deputy is dead.
The prisoner killed him?
KILPATRICK:
Yeah, very dead.
GUTIERREZ:
I made a mistake.
KILPATRICK: You made a mistake not killing him in the first place.
I should have brought him in myself.
KILPATRICK:
Let's go.
Come on.
GUTIERREZ: Senor, if you force me to watch you kill this man, Brand...
...I will hunt you down.
Of course.
What I am saying is the truth.
If necessary...
...I will kill you.
What are you doing here?
Where is Brand?
Shut up. Brand and I made a deal.
She's yours,
15 minutes for 10 pesos, amigo.
That leaves a long ways to go for a thousand dollars.
[SCREAMING]
GUTIERREZ:
You know...
...I have heard many stories of you.
The sheriff of Santa Rosa...
...who carries no guns.
A man who can win...
...without killing.
KILPATRICK:
Well...
...if I wasn't such a man...
...my wife and child would be alive now.
GUTIERREZ:
One thing, senor...
...if it was not your wife and child but somebody else's...
...would you be here now?
KILPATRICK:
That's one of their damned horses.
They're in there.
[CHATTERING IN DISTANCE]
[GUTIERREZ GRo ANS]
Shut up.
I hope one of you survives.
I hate to go back to my village empty-handed, you know?
Looks bad.
KILPATRICK:
Put your hands behind your back.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
GUTIERREZ:
If you'll untie me, I could be of help.
[WoMAN SCREAMING]
Where's Brand?
Where's Brand?
Brand.
Where's Brand?
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
Where is he?
MARIA:
Hey, what the hell is this?
What do you want here?
What are you doing this for?
Get out of here. Get out.
- Where's Brand?
- I don't know where the hell he is.
What are you doing?
- Where is he? Where is he?
- I don't know.
Where's Brand?
- Where is he? Where is he?
- I don't know.
I don't...
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
GUTIERREZ:
Enough.
That's enough.
KILPATRICK:
He was here, wasn't he?
He was here.
Yes, he was here.
He came to see our daughter.
How long ago did he leave?
How long ago did he leave?
About an hour ago.
That's the first time I see him.
In five years, that's the first time I see him.
Now suddenly, he comes back.
He expects to find things the way he left them.
Our daughter...
...I put her in the convent.
What convent?
I couldn't be a whore with a child in the same room.
What convent?
The one in Sierra victoria.
I know the nuns will take good care of her.
Is that where he's gone?
Yeah.
You know where that is?
Thirty miles back, the way we come.
Thirty miles, let's go.
It's a long ride.
GUTIERREZ:
Put on your clothes.
You know, you did not have to shoot him six times.
Five times.
If it bothers you...
...l'll pay for it.
Katherine!
Katherine!
He cannot see anything.
You take him to doctor, but in the next village.
Are you all right?
KILPATRICK:
Yeah, just a little stunned.
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.
I'm all right. I'm all right, let's go.
Let's go.
I'm all right.
I'll be back.
Would you get me...?
Get me some water on that cloth for me please.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Gutierrez?
Gutierrez.
Gutierrez!
Gutierrez!
Gutierrez!
Help me, somebody, quick.
Somebody help me, quick. Help me.
MARIA:
I am going to take you to the doctor.
Doctor?
Doctor? No. No, the convent.
The convent, take me to the convent.
No, I couldn't.
He'd kill me if I took you there. I can't.
Take me to that convent.
I'll pay you for the time it takes you to get me there.
All right?
Okay?
Yes?
All of it.
The whole saddlebag.
It's a deal.
It's a deal. Come on. Come on.
KILPATRICK:
Somebody's there.
- I cannot see...
- Shh!
It is magistrado, your friend.
- Gutierrez?
- Hm.
Is Brand with him?
- I cannot see.
KILPATRICK: You're lying.
MARIA:
Don't shoot. You're gonna kill him, stop.
No! No.
Do not kill him. You cannot see.
No, don't shoot.
The man is an animal.
That's what he is, an animal.
GUTIERREZ:
Stop it.
If you are going to judge men...
...begin with that pig who fathered your child.
[MARIA SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
[GUTIERREZ SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
Here.
It's hot.
I'm sorry I hit you last night.
You give me no choice.
Now that we're apologizing...
...I really wasn't shooting at you either.
This is obvious.
Your gun, you can now notch with one tree...
...two cactus bush, a rock.
- It was that bad, huh?
- No, that good.
First time I see you laugh.
We sheriffs don't have too much to laugh about.
GUTIERREZ:
Tell me, senor...
...how did you become a sheriff?
It's a long story.
I stop you when my cup is empty, huh?
I guess it began when I was a youngster.
My father was...
My father was shot by a sheriff.
He didn't do anything wrong, he was just wanted...
...for some questions they wanted to ask him.
But my father wasn't one to be pushed around.
So he resisted...
...and he was shot.
That's why I decided to become a sheriff.
I decided if there were gonna be good laws...
...they had to be...
Had to be enforced...
...by men with some sense of justice.
That's what I used to believe.
We two, we could catch this Brand.
And bring him to justice.
Oh, no.
Not Mr. Brand.
That kind of justice.
I've seen too many guilty men walk out of courts of law, free.
Scared jury, bribed judge...
...clever lawyer, free.
That's not gonna happen to Mr. Brand.
No, sir.
I'm very sorry for you.
My cup is empty.
We go.
The horse must rest.
We'll stop here.
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
Water.
It's hot.
Hey, what? What is...? What's go...?
I'm sorry, senor.
I had to prove to myself that you are blind.
I put a scorpion in your water.
We're that close, huh?
Just over the next hill.
We go.
Drop the gun.
Come on.
Now, I'm going in there alone.
And don't follow me in.
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
I don't wanna kill you.
And I believe you don't wanna kill me.
You know I'm right.
Listen.
KILPATRICK:
I don't need you anymore.
Take him back to Nuevo Magdalena.
There's your money.
BRAND: Since my wife died,
I've been out of the country on business.
I would've been down here every weekend just visiting. You don't understand.
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
Least I can do.
You know, I consider your offering very generous.
It ain't an offering like charity, it's just that I'm grateful...
...that you're looking after my girl.
Well, but as you see, our situation is not quite desperate.
As soon as I get myself settled in a good old job...
...l'll be back and take her off your hand.
- There's the little girl.
Has she ever grown.
Bless you, Sister.
You just look how she's grown.
I didn't expect her to recognize me because it's been quite a while.
Hey, Luisy.
Luisy?
Just your old daddy.
Ain't she something?
Are you crying? Come on.
You ain't afeared of your daddy.
Wanna give your old daddy a kiss?
Come on.
Just a little old kiss for Daddy like you used to.
Come on.
Luisy?
Come on.
You know something? She is beautiful.
About the prettiest kid I ever...
[CHATTERING]
[GUNSHoTS]
You can't keep running away!
Do you hear me?
Brand?
[LUISY SPEAKS IN SPANISH]
Brand?
Brand!
I've got something here that belongs to you.
Do you hear me?
Now, I'm coming out.
And I'm giving you...
...10 seconds to come out, now, do you hear me?
One...
...two...
...three...
...four...
...five, six...
[LUISY CRYING]
...seven.
Take the money!
I got more hid!
You can take it all!
Eight...
...nine.
Don't!
LUISY:
Mommy.
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
You were right.
Maybe I was not so right, senor.
What?
My witness is dead.
I have no other evidence.
I cannot hold him.
You...
You mean, you're gonna set him free?
That is the law.
KILPATRICK:
Did you hear that, Mr. Brand?
You're free.
You're free because the law says so.
BRAND:
Don't that beat all?
An innocent man, innocent.
You've been dragging me halfway across Mexico.
Disgusting.
Ain't that so, big fella?
Well, now, look who we got back there.
I'll see you after.
Gonna have me a nice long walk.
I'm gonna get me a nice long drink.
You wanna join me?
To show there's no hard feelings?
Come on, big fella.
Tell them all. Tell them all in Mex.
Tell them the tequila's on Mr...
You are under arrest.

Stop...
...or I'll shoot.

For four hooves, a head and 125 pound of cow guts.
We know it's not
A coyote this time.
Well, let's report it
Before it gets blamed on us.

To mail that to somebody.

Double the value we owe you.
Or more.
Is this reservation cattle ?
Oh, no, ma'am.

We swapped
A jeep for it.

To lose our Christmas bonus down at the bank.

It will be hard cash.

Over every inch of their hides.

why, I was
the very best. why'd you quit ?
I got caught.
Sent me up
To the penitentiary at deer lodge.
why, I spent three years
breaking horses for the  prison ranch up yonder...
While everybody was having such
A fine time in world war II.
When I realized that
My thievery had cost me the circus of the century,
Why, I decided
To go straight, work on the other side of the law.
Well, Mr. Beige,
I think it's about time
We acclimate you to the b-bar lazy-t.
This country around here
Is a little steeper than what you're used to.
See that peak up there ?
That's squaw mountain.
It go about 11,000.
Careful.  attaboy.
We raise very correct cattle
At the b-bar lazy-t.
[ exhales ]
The last time I saw
Him on his feet was four days ago.
That little simp,
Laura, brings his food to him three times a day.
Mr. Beige told me
That very often his mere presence...
Puts an end to rustling.
Evidently his reputation
Precedes him.
I don't know why, Cora.
I sort of feel
We've been had.
To me, the worst of it
Is the way Curt and Burt follow that Laura around.
[ scoffs ]
You know, we're not getting
Half the use out of them we once did.
Yeah.  I'm afraid
Our two chimps are in love.
They coming knuckling
Out of the bunkhouse every morning,
Trying to beat each other
To Laura's side...
To help bring Mr. Beige's
Breakfast to him.
Darling ?
Hmm ?
Are you ever sorry we got out
Of the beauty parlor business ?
gee,
I miss Schenectady
Sometimes.
Jack,
I just got to find out
Where this bastard keeps his money.
[ shot fires, echoes ]
[ tires screech ]
Cecil, no !  Jesus !
Cec--  Jesus Christ !
Oh, my god.
Hi, boys.
Hello.
Hi.
Burt and me thought
You ought to know what bad planning feels like.
Thank you.
What does it feel like ?
You made your point.
[ Curt ] boys, I got a question.
When we're fixing to skate off
With a semi truckload of living veal,
What in the hell
Are you doing up here penny-anteing for one steer ?
[ Jack ]
Sport. sport.
Uh-huh, Cecil and i
Are sportsmen.
Let me tell you,
Wise guy.
We have to go up and get
Mr. Henry Beige now...
And bring him
To the kill.
'cause I don't know
What you were shooting with,
But you for sure
Could hear it up at the ranch.
I don't know what they shot
This steer with,
But it blowed a hole in him
You can throw a cat through.
It's got my curiosity up.
She's either been hit
By a bazooka or an express train.
Wait a minute.  yeah.
Yeah, here she comes.
Well, I'll be doggoned.
If I wasn't so dad-blamed old,
I wouldn't know what that was.
What is it, Mr. Beige ?
It's a .50 caliber bullet.
- what kinda gun ?
- a sharps buffalo rifle.
You know, things is gettin'
Downright romantic. [ chuckles ]
I don't know
What these boys got in mind.
But it's a good sign
They wanted us to get dressed up.
They're nice boys, all right,
But I sure don't need to get grossed out again.

What are you up to ?
Mrs. Brown asked me to hoover
These Navajos.
You have to be careful
You don't unravel them with that machine.
I'd never use no hoover
On Indian rugs.
Well, Mrs. Brown said I was
To do it this way, and, uh,
These are
Mrs. Brown's Navajos.
Well, she's a jerk-off.
H-huh ?  what ?
That's just an
Expression I heard.
[ chuckles ]
Mrs. Brown probably
Knows best when it comes to her own navajos.
Yeah, I think
That's true, Laura. uh--
When she told me to hoover,
I just hoovered.
I didn't ask no
Further questions.
I think you're right
To follow instructions.
Um, Laura ?
I got a crush on you.
Burt.
No, curt.
Oh, I meant that. I meant curt.
You're so sweet
And so innocent.
But yet, you always seem
To have something going on in your mind.
Would, uh,
Would you consider
Taking a walk with me ?
I'm gonna try
And finish up here.
Honey, I'm back !
And I have picked up
A piece of information...
You'd practically
Pay to hear.
John Cameron Swazye--
Hopscotching the world for news.
Burt, get Mr. Beige.
Yes, sir.
Wait'll you get a load of this.
Tell me now.
This is just gonna
Make you twitch.
I hate to have anybody
Barge in on me when I'm a-dreamin'.
How can I tell that ?
You were sitting up in front of the tv ?
How am I gonna tell
You were having a dream ?
[ thunder rumbling ]
Mr. Beige.
I've got a bit
Of news for you. that's nice.
I don't get no paper.
You guys using
The same gag book ?
What was this news
That you had for me ?
Well, it seems...
That an abandoned Lincoln
Continental was found in an open field...
Up the shield's valley.
So ?
It was full of bullet holes.
- why is that ?
- for no apparent reason.
But the bullets that did
The work might be of interest to you.
Why ?
They were from a .50 caliber
Sharps buffalo rifle.
Oh, I see.
Is that all ?
Yeah.
Well, in that case, I reckon
I'll just wander on back to the bunkhouse...
Before I lose track
Of that dream I was having.
You see, I was dreaming that
I was in ancient Egypt. this here pharaoh--
Hold on a minute, Henry.
Let's just try
To focus here a minute.
I get the picture.
Uh, that Lincoln automobile
Was shot up...
With the same kind of gun
That killed that steer of yours.
Well, if this doesn't
Interest you, Mr. Beige,
I hope you won't be offended
If I pursue it.
Oh, that's fine.
Go right ahead.
But you know, there's
One incredible thing that I gotta find out.
- what's that ?
- was I just a commoner ?
I don't follow.
Was I a commoner
Or was I actually a member...
Of the Pharaoh's
Royal family ?
You see, in this dream...
I was a-standing up there
On top of that pyramid with the pharaoh,
And it was just like we knowed
Each other for years and years.
and the Nile was a-flowin'
down there below us...
And the slaves was a-bowin'
And a-scrapin'...
And there was
Dancing girls, and--
[ Curt ]
Oh, god, she's beautiful.
Like a flower...
Or a fawn.
So carefree.
She's almost
Like... Bambi.

Oh.
You look beautiful.

Thanks, pal.
Officer, um, can you
Tell me who that Lincoln continental belongs to ?
The one you just
Sent to the dump ?
It's belongs to
A Mr. Wilbur Fargo. what's the story ?
Well, it was
Stolen and vandalized. that's all we know right now.
We got a real feeling
It was Negroes.
Wait a minute.  I'm way
Out of line.  let's just say it could've been negroes.
Have you got
Mr. Fargo's address ? sure.
When was the last time
You saw a negro in Livingston ?
On the 1:15 from billings.
It was a redcap.
You sure it wasn't
Al Jolson ?
All right, all right.
I realize your car...
Was amply covered
By insurance,
But I have
A special reason to want to know...
If you have any notion
Of who might taken it.
I don't know,
And I don't wanna know.
Sounds to me like maybe
You don't want to know.
That may be it.
You already know ?
No.
I think you do.
You're full of shit then.
What is it ?
Who you trying to protect ?
Nobody.
Who is it, Wilbur ?
I just said I didn't know.
Now you're gonna have to get
The hell out of my house.
You trying to protect
Yourself ? no.
I think you are.
Well, what if I am ?
What if I am trying
To protect myself ?
What of it ?
All right, Wilbur.
Let's you and i
Leave it at that.
But, uh, just for
The sake of reason,
Why don't you count
On seeing me again.
[ train bell clanging ]
That was Burt.
Says go ahead
And rent a semi.
I tried to get him
To split with us on the rental.
He knows we got the Baseheart
Of Bozeman money, though.
He wants us to front
The expenses, take it off the top out of the profits.
Real sharpie.
He said he lined up a feed lot
In rainbow rock, south Dakota,
Where we can lay out
The whole load.
It'll be days probably
Before they discover that stock missing.
So John Brown's not
Even interested.
At least not enough
To go riding around his ranch.  hi.
Boys ?
Couple of coffees, huh ?
Stock's gonna be up
In that upper corral near antelope Butte.
We'll just drive
The truck up there and load 'em in.
Where is Burt and curt
Gonna be at ? asleep in the bunkhouse.
He was real clear
About that.  we blow it, he says he doesn't know us.
What are we gonna
Do with the money ?
[ chuckles ]
I don't know.
[ sighs ]
This is just to keep
From falling asleep. don't you know that ?
Well,
Thank you.
Old pal,
The thing is, I don't have
Any trouble keeping awake.
All right,
Then I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll finish this job,
Retire at rancho deluxe,
Just south of the big
Rock candy mountain.
And we'll be
Wide awake !

No, this would be

What that little twerp
Was trying to hide.
What little twerp ?
i am not sure this would
interest you, Mr. Beige.
It has to do with
Solving a little problem we have around here.
- what problem would that be ?
- that would be rustling, Mr. Beige.
Well, I'll be dogged.
Listen at him now.
yes, you listen
to me, all right. all of you.
We are the victims of crime,
And it just seems
To bore you.
it even bores you,
Mr. Beige. it don't exactly bore me.

I have got a hot lead.
Well, run her down then, son.
Don't let me take the fun out of it for you.

It's okay.

Oh, it's just that
Uncle Henry has always been such a nice person,
So good to everybody,
And it just broke
My heart to see him so old and helpless.
I know, darling, I know.
[ sobbing ] oh, don't call me darling.
Why ?
Because !
I can't have anything
To do with this place after uncle Henry's failure.
Oh, Laura--
I just can't !

There's no chance for uncle Henry now.

We'll be gone.

The great stock detective...
Will have to look defeat
In the face.
But I still don't
See why I can't call you darling.
Oh, you can't see that ?
no, I can't. i really can't.
It's because I love you.
And since uncle Henry's failed,
I have to stick by his side...
And-and take him home.
If I let you call me
Them endearments,
It'd just be admitting
Everything I gotta leave.
And that would be hard.
Too hard.

It's okay.
It'll be okay.
It's okay.
I'll explain it to you.

You were addressing the multitudes.

But I've got the goods
On the rustler.
Is there only one ?
I've got the goods,
That's all.  will you hand me a towel, honey ?
Mmm.
I don't see why I should wait--
Just because it'd be polite--
For that dipshit

At some remote future date.

You are charged with willfully
Destroying your own automobile to collect the insurance...
And with operating

To use a different rifle for different jobs.

- I thought I told you to stay put.
- I got tired waiting.
- Something came up.
- What?
- I'll tell you later.
- I'll wait here.
- I want you to go back to the hotel.
- Why?
Because a man's going to get himself killed here.
You want to watch that? Take the lady back to the hotel.
- Mr Malson. Mr Beaudry.
- Bob.
- This is Mr Tanner from Mimbreno.
- I'm Bob Valdez.
Bob's town constable in Lanoria.
Works two or three nights a week, Mexican part of town.
The nights I'm in town, I ride shotgun. I work with your company...
Let's get some shade.
- Bob.
- Yes, sir?
There's an army deserter down there.
Killed James C Erin at Fort Huachuca.
Mr Tanner spotted him driving through Lanoria.
Where is the, er... the sheriff?
Up in St David. He won't be back till tonight.
Mr Tanner is sure that is the man?
JC Erin was a good friend of Mr Tanner's.
He feels very strongly about this.
We have to be sure, Mr
Malson. It's a serious thing.
This is Mr Tanner's show,
Bob. Better let him run it.
Apache.
The man's wife. Or his woman, maybe.
Señor Tanner yell for her to come out, but she never come, till now.
I think she's saying she don't give a damn about you or your rifle.
Shoot her?
Could make her jump some.
I could use a little something to drink.
Diego!
Where's he going?
Hey, he's dumber than he looks.
If he flushes that nigger, you could really show us some fancy shooting.
That's close enough.
- I'll kill you if you raise it.
- I believe it.
- Can we talk?
- You're talking.
A man up there, Mr Tanner, he says you killed somebody.
- I never heard of him.
- He says your name is Johnson.
It ain't.
He says you killed a man at Fort Huachuca.
I was in the 10th a long time ago.
- Deserter?
- I served it out.
Maybe you've got something to prove it?
In the wagon, there's a leather bag with my papers.
Would you come with me and talk to Mr Tanner?
- I don't know him.
- Then he won't know you.
He didn't know me this morning when he chased me here.
All right. We'll get the paper that says you were discharged.
Then we will show it to Mr Tanner, huh?
- He comes down here.
- Sure.
Please, will you... point the gun some other way?
- You son of a bitch.
- No!
It looked like him. It sure looked like him.
He ain't the one you said?
No. I've seen this one before, though. I know I've seen him before.
Constable, you went and killed the wrong coon.
Listen... I'll take you back to town.
I know a place you can stay tonight, all right?
We?
- Now, who is we?
- Well, everybody was there.
You mean take up a collection, pass the hat.
Yes, Mr Malson.
Mighty fine thought, Bob, mighty fine.
- Don't you agree, Earl?
- Sure.
Give her a few dollars, enough to get home.
- Any idea where she wants to go?
- I don't know.
Back to her people, I think.
Good idea. You've got about three or four dollars there.
It's not much.
She'll be the richest damn squaw on the reservation.
How much did you have in mind, Bob?
I was thinking, maybe... $200?
I would like to know why we're listening to this greaser.
- RL, keep your mouth closed.
- He killed him. Why's he coming to us?
Shut up or get out of here.
That's a lot of money, Bob, $200.
Almost as much as I make in a year.
Giving her that is like admitting we owe it to her, like we're to blame.
Well, who else?
Wait a minute, Bob. When it comes to fixing the blame, I agree with RL.
You took it on yourself to go down there and talk to that man. You killed him.
I know that, Mr Malson. I know that.
Don't take it so hard. If Tanner hadn't made that mistake, it wouldn't have happened.
- Sure, it's all Tanner's fault.
- Go tell him that.
Maybe we should tell him.
I tell you what, Bob.
Why don't you tell him?
If he puts up 100, we'll put up 100.
He's driving that stock he bought from Mr Malson back to Mimbreno.
You can catch him at the swing station.
You mean it, Mr Malson?
You have my word, Bob.
I know everybody who does business with Señor Tanner.
I don't know a Bob Valdez.
It is a private matter.
Señor Tanner don't know you either.
I meet him today. I kill a man for him.
- What do you want?
- To talk with you... about the man today.
What man?
The one who was... He had a woman with him.
Say what you want.
We were talking
- Mr Malson, Mr Beaudry. You know who I mean.
And we were saying that... that maybe we should give something to the woman.
- Now she don't have a man.
- They send you out here?
No, I thought of it. But they will give $100... if you will give the same.
Get rid of him.
I'm not finished yet.
- What did you say?
- I want to explain...
He don't hear you so good.
It's too loud out here.
Who is that man?
What happened today?
Was it to do with Jim's murder?
For Christ's sake!
I wish you'd stop looking for whoever did it. I don't care.
I do.
Because there are people who think you did it.
Yes.
You killed men without caring what people think.
I don't like them thinking I had to kill one to get his wife.
They're going to know that you came to me because you wanted to.
That's true, isn't it?
Easy... Easy.
Hello, Valdez. Bórrego!
Is honour to my house to have as guest the brave shotgun rider of the stage,
- His Excellency the constable of Lanoria.
- In the Mexican part of town.
- I need some water for the horses.
- Anita!
How is she?
I'll take her back to the reservation.
A little gift for your house from my house.
Oh, that house.
Come out of the sun, and we will have a glass together.
He's pretty good. Certainly be as good as his father.
Better.
Last week, Señor Malson see him. Promise him a job.
Señor Malson.
"Mighty fine boy you got there,
Diego. Chip off the old block.
"I reckon he'll be breaking horses for me soon, same as his pa."
Oh, Señor Malson, you are too kind to this poor peon.
What an honour this worthless son of mine should work his ass off to make you rich.
"Well, you're a good greaser, Diego.
"As long as you are a good greaser,
I treat you fair and square.
"Yes, sirree, Diego.
"You people sure know how to live
- singing, dancing, screwing.
"You don't worry about nothing."
I come back for her later.
Bueno, Señor Tanner. It's a deal.
You will have the guns in Nogales by Friday?
We'll be there.
I'll be a son of a bitch.
Mr Tanner.
Señor Tanner.
The circuit judge comes down to
Lanoria tomorrow from St David.
I have to report what has happened.
The Indian woman can make trouble for us... with the law.
- Now, $100 is... is not much to give.
- Look, you.
I don't know how you horseshit them people into giving a greaser a tin star, but you don't horseshit Frank Tanner.
Señor Tanner!
Why you don't help this woman?
He don't learn, does he?
Remember Tucson? That preacher?
Fix him the same.
Now let's see him walk.
Hey, where you go?
It's that way... The way you came.
I came on a horse.
Don't worry about the horse. We take care of it.
Hey, don't fall on your back. You'll be like a turtle.
- I don't remember asking you here.
- I got tired riding fence for Mr Malson.
I figured you could use another gun.
You couldn't even hit a sitting-duck nigger.
She never smiles.
If she was my woman...
I would make her smile.
Vamos!
- Going riding?
- You bastard.
Why don't you cut him loose?
He's only trying to help a poor woman who's lost her husband.
So am I. I'm helping one already.
One poor widow woman's enough.
- Jim would have used this on you.
- Are you thinking of it?
You're a damn fool to worry about anything except the way I treat you.
I treat you all right, don't I?
Sometimes you're human. Sometimes.
We'll deliver the guns to Nogales soon. Would you like to come along?
Aren't there any whores in Nogales?
Sure, lots of them.
Lots of priests, too.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Priests marry people, don't they?
- I'll hold you to that, Frank.
- I reckon you will.
I swear, you sure are one dumb son of a bitch.
When that pole busted, where did you think it was going to go?
It's your old amigo you tried to bash with your shotgun butt.
You remember that, don't you?
You killed the wrong coon and was going to take it out on me.
Cut me loose... please.
You must ache some from that stooping over.
You know, I didn't like you trying to hit me with that scatter-gun.
It made me sore, I'll tell you.
Cut me loose... please.
- How did I get here?
- You crawled.
I heard the dogs.
Oh...
- They nailed me to a cross.
- What cross?
Somebody cut me loose.
Somebody stabbed you in the back.
No.
- No, a tree did that.
- What kind of a tree does that?
- Where's the Indian woman?
- She take her wagon and go.
All right. You take me home.
Gracias, Diego.
That's far enough!
It's not true. The constable from Lanoria?
Last time I saw you, you had a cross on your back.
- I get tired of it.
- Somebody found you, huh?
- Somebody.
- You had luck with you that time.
- Friends?
- Sure. Like you and me.
We talk a while, we have a drink of whiskey.
What you think about that?
I think I see many guns.
You come up here to talk and you bring all those guns.
This little thing? It's for rabbits.
That's what you come here for, to hunt rabbits?
No, I come to ask you to do something for me.
- Because we're friends?
- That's right.
I want you to go see Señor Tanner and tell him Valdez is coming.
I think somebody else go.
Listen. I've been here all day. There's no somebody else.
There is just you in front of me. That's all.
You sure of that? You bet your life on it?
- Or yours.
- No.
What kind of talk is that with two friends?
You want me to tell something to Mr Tanner? All right, I'll go.
Put the rabbit gun down.
You wait here. I'll go tell Mr Tanner what you say, then I tell you what he say.
I be here.
Don't move.
What... what do you put in that thing?
I told you. Something for rabbits.
Listen, I'm going to get your horse and put you on it.
I can't... I can't ride.
Sure you can. Ride to Señor Tanner and tell him Valdez is coming.
You hear what I say?
Valdez is coming.
But listen, my friend, I think you better go quick.
- What else did he say?
- That's all.
Just, "Valdez is coming."
Go out and get him.
Where? He could be anywhere.
Well, God damn it, you got people who read sign.
Si.
Well, send them!
We go to Nogales tomorrow.
We go to Nogales when I say we go.
- Nothing.
- How many men you got out?
A snake couldn't crawl through.
I suppose Nogales is off.
Delayed.
Señor Valdez seems to be making a fool of you without my help.
You sound like a wife.
That's right.
So let's wait till it's official.
Good night, Frank.
You are a bitch.
What is bothering you?
Valdez is coming.
That's what bothers me.
Que?
Valdez is a foolish man, but why he warn us he's coming?
Come to bed, cariño.
Maybe not so foolish.
Valdez says he's coming.
We go out to meet him.
Maybe that's what Valdez wants.
Que?
You son of a bitch!
It's in the safe.
Get it.
The candle.
Put the gun on the floor. Slowly, please.
Goddamn it, don't shoot!
You look for somebody?
First you drop the guns.
Then you turn around.
We found him, Mr Tanner.
- Was she with him?
- No, sir.
He said to give you a message, tell you he's got something to trade now.
For you to come with $100.
Come where?
- They were three of your best, you said?
- My very best.
- You still want to go to Nogales?
- You want Valdez?
I get him now.
You should have stay where I leave you.
Where are you taking me?
Up.
You will be home soon enough. Frank
Tanner knows where to find me now.
- He'll come.
- Sí.
- He won't come alone.
- I think so, too.
You're a fool.
- I already said no to you once, boy.
- But I got more to offer this time.
- Like what?
- I heard you were looking for Bob Valdez?
- I'm listening.
- There's a man who'd know where he is.
Who?
The greaser who brought him into town after you run him out. Diego Luz.
What is your name?
Gay Erin.
Mrs James C Erin.
Fort Huachuca?
Yes.
The black man I kill, he don't kill your husband.
I know.
You're going to marry Frank Tanner?
What does it matter to you?
I want to know if he will pay for you.
Let me go and I'll get the money.
No.
What difference does it make where it comes from?
It makes a difference.
- Where's Valdez?
- I don't know.
- Where does he hide in the mountains?
- I don't know.
Nobody here knows.
- You touch her, you better kill me.
- We can do that.
I don't know where is Valdez. Man, who you think I put first? Him?
That's a nice-looking girl.
I like a little more up there. Or maybe first one of the day it would be all right.
Shoot her first.
You hold on to yourself if you can and you say... what Valdez is doing in the mountains.
I don't know.
You're his friend. You helped him!
You took him to
Lanoria to get his guns.
I hope he puts one round into you, you rotten son of a pig.
- He don't know.
- We wasted enough time here.
Fix his hands so he won't be so helpful next time.
Burn the place down. Valdez could see the smoke a long way.
Burn the place down!
They're friends, ain't they?
He'll come. Leave me and two men.
You'd come to your friend's burning house?
- Sure.
- You wouldn't.
But Valdez... might.
For the cold.
Mr Frank Tanner. He know your husband?
You think Frank Tanner killed my husband?
- He could.
- He could but he didn't.
- Where are you going?
- To feed the horses.
Señor Malson's horses.
I saw you come across the pasture low.
Not low enough, if you saw me.
Low enough. The one by the house did not see you.
- What they do to you?
- What you see.
- I'm sorry.
- Is not your fault.
Mr RL Davis bring them.
Listen, if you see that one, give him something for me, huh?
- You're a good friend. The best.
- I tell you something, friend.
When they start in on my girl, if
I know where you are, I tell them.
Where's Valdez?
Maybe I'd take him alive, huh?
Mr Tanner would like that, especially if he'd done anything to you.
He done anything to you?
All right, now, you just stay put, ma'am. Don't let on nothing.
Jesus Christ, I'm hit!
Hey, don't shoot!
Hey, don't shoot!
I'm coming out!
I'm coming out.
Don't...
No, please.
They're going to shoot.
No.
- This one for Diego.
- No, I saved you!
I cut you loose. Yes, I did. I cut you loose from them poles.
How in the hell do you think you got loose?
Look at your wrist. That one.
The scar, where my knife slipped cutting the ropes.
Look at it!
Get on your horse!
- Did you fire at them?
- Yes, sir.
- Hit anybody?
- I don't think so.
- But you might have.
- Yes, sir.
You could have killed my woman.
We lost five. You shoot him, that's six, the same as Valdez kill.
How many you want to kill for that man?
As many as it takes.
Instead of shoot him,
I make him ride point.
That way he's the first one Valdez will see.
I got to get loose somehow.
Crazy bastard's gonna kill me.
Why? You cut him loose.
He's a killer, lady. You know how many men he killed the last two days?
You don't know him, lady.
- Mr RL Davis.
- Huh?
Come here.
I want you to go down there, by the big rock.
What do you want me down there for?
I want to see you in front of me.
- What if they come?
- They're already coming.
- I don't see nothing.
- Take my word.
- You think you can make a stand here...
- By the rock.
Please.
They will see this.
Go behind the rock.
Are you going to make a stand here?
I'm just going to slow them down.
Sharps.
Or some kind of buffalo gun.
Or a cannon.
He can shoot, and he know when to move... and we have lost five more.
- You ain't gonna find your way in this.
- It will be the same for Frank Tanner.
You know how many men he got to work through here?
- Not so many now.
- He don't care how many men you kill.
He don't care you kill her.
- Tell him.
- Tell who what?
Frank Tanner
- he comes alone with $100, or I kill her!
You ain't going to shoot me in the back?
We camp here.
Hey!
Mr Tanner! Mr Tanner!
Mr Tanner!
You're not going to kill me.
That was a bluff, wasn't it?
But they'll kill you.
Send me back.
You didn't kill that black man. I did.
I let Frank send me back to the hotel that day.
I could have stayed and stopped it.
You tell me Frank Tanner don't kill your husband.
And when I say the black man don't, you say, "I know."
You know who kill him?
You know who kill him.
Who kill your husband?
Tell me.
Who kill him?
Who kill him?
I did.
No!
- What?
- Nothing.
I just got done telling you everything he told me.
- How's Mrs Erin?
- She looked just fine.
- I mean, he ain't hurt her any.
- He keep her tied?
- Yes, sir.
- Or she'd run off?
Yeah, you bet she would.
- You think he'd kill her?
- With this one, you can never tell.
Goddamn it!
You got any ideas?
I could ride all night, around the fog, maybe I get up above him by morning.
- You coming up behind.
- If he holds put till then.
He's got to wait for this fog to lift, same as any man.
He don't do like any man.
Some things. He took a woman along, huh?
Miguel! Vamos!
Is he coming?
- He's coming.
- But not alone.
No, not alone.
- What's out there?
- The pass.
If I could reach there, an army don't find me.
- You've been there before?
- Many years ago, chasing Apache.
But now I think there is somebody else out there. El Segundo.
I can smell him.
I should have keep moving last night, fog or no fog.
You can go.
You know something?
I would liked to have gotten the $100 for the Indian woman.
I'd like to see Frank pay it.
You all right? Can you stand?
- You like tobacco?
- No.
Tell me something.
Who are you?
I told you once before. Bob Valdez.
You know something, Bob Valdez, you hit one, I think, 700, 800 yards.
Closer to 1,000.
- What was it? Sharps?
- My own load.
- You ever hunt buffalo?
- Apache.
I knew it. When?
Before I know better.
- You know how many dead we got?
- You count, huh?
- You bet.
- You hurt bad?
- No.
You better come over here.
We can talk about it when we get home.
I'm not going home.
Is she better than your Indian squaw?
Tell your whore to move over.
Move over, please.
Little bit more.
Any last words?
- Crazy bastard.
Kill him!
Segundo.
She's not my woman.
I ain't got no gun.
¡Tomás! Vete a casa, no es para ti.
- No es para ti.
- ¡Tomás! Están libres.
- What are you saying?
- I tell them to go home.
I hire them, I fire them.
Goddamn it!
I'm talking to all of you!
I'm ordering you to kill him!
Señor Tanner...
I have an idea.
You have a gun in your holster.
You shoot me.
- Next time.
- No.
I should have killed you three days ago.
Or gone to Nogales.
Or paid the $100.
That's kissin'!
More champagne!
Give the boys another 20 bucks.
When you start running low, holler.
There's more where that came from.
Open up a bottle for yourselves too.
It ain't every day when Goldie opens a joint in Denver and gets married to boot.
Wish we could get off the train with you.
That's one wedding I'd like to see.
- Yes, sir, yes, ma'am. Sure would.
- I wish you could too, boys.
- Right, girls?
- Yeah!
Did you ever see such a bunch of beautiful bridesmaids in your whole damn life?
Penny for your thoughts, lad.
They ain't worth it.
I was just thinking, better get some sleep.
We got a busy day in Denver tomorrow.
Busy wedding day!
Good night, baby.
- What's the next stop?
- Purgatory.
- Purgatory?
- Mm. Mining town. It ain't much.
Wake me when we get to Purgatory.
- Just me, not Miss Goldie.
- Yes, sir.
Man!
- The midnight on time, Ez?
- See what I'm writing, don't you?
- The midnight on time, Ez?
- I don't know more than you, Mr Barton.
But it seems kinda high class to write down that she is.
Don't look like you're wearin' a gun under that coat. Smart.
Ever heard of a man gettin' into trouble mindin' his own business, Ez?
How am I expected to mind my own business? I sent the telegram.
Telegrams are supposed to be private.
From the telegrapher?
I sure would feel a lot better with weight on my hip, Pa.
If that party mentioned in the telegram shows up, you'd best be unarmed.
Ez, I told you to mind...
- The Sidewinder!
- Your sister's name is Patience.
Patience!
You stay out of this, Pa.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Teachin' them jackass miners a lesson.
Oh, you give me that!
I've told you not to shoot at people!
They had it comin'.
One of them said something vile.
He said "Does your mother know you're out, Cecilia?"
You consider that grounds for shootin' up the town?
- I knew what he meant.
- I sure as hell don't.
They are trying to ruin my good name.
I have sworn to go to Miss Hunter's
College on the Hudson River, New York, for young ladies of good family.
Nothing's gonna stop me!
Except you killin' somebody.
- I only shoot at riffraff.
- You shot at us.
- I missed you.
- You couldn't hit a bull with a banjo.
- Watch that smart mouth.
- Hit him, Pa.
If I hit anybody, it's gonna be you.
Take her home, Oriville.
- Take your damn hands off me.
- Don't let her stop for a beer.
- She gets mean when she drinks.
- How come you called that girl Patience?
Can hear her a long way off when the wind's right.
Ain't enough late to make it worthwhile changin' the board.
Sounds downright peaceful, don't it?
Calm before the storm, if that certain party is on board.
Yeah.
Well?
We'll say we know you didn't get off at Purgatory.
We don't know where you did get off, but we know it wasn't Purgatory.
Don't open up, boys. Nothing but mail for Purgatory. No passengers gettin' off.
It's bad manners to call the conductor a liar, so let's not. No sense openin' up.
Nobody's gettin' off at Purgatory.
Evenin'. Or mornin', rather.
It's one in the morning.
- I got a watch.
- Just get off the train?
Ever hear of an eagle pickin' up a grown man and carryin' him across country?
- No, I can't say that I have.
- Well, you have now.
I come by eagle.
That's him, Pa. If only I had my rifle,
I'd nail him between the shoulder blades.
That'd be murder.
And it might be the wrong man.
It's gotta be him. Big, mean and ugly, and sneakin' off the train. What's next?
Give him time to get a room, then ask some questions at the hotel.
Let's wait in the Chinaman's back room.
- Pa, she's gonna get her another beer.
- So am I!
Can't you read? That sign says
"Take a key, go to bed. "
- That sign?
- That sign... must've gotten a few strays.
We got lots of shooting in this town.
Here, register.
- Your handle and your hometown.
- Already did.
Smith. Is that your real name?
Not that I'm nosey.
- Give me a room.
- Ah, keep your shirt on!
Oh, say, that's real silk, isn't it?
You must be rich. Well?
- Well, what?
- You rich? Not that I'm curious.
- Is there another hotel in this town?
- Ah, keep your shirt on.
Your silk shirt.
That's a good one!
Come on.
Just as good a service as in the Palmer House in Chicago. Come on.
Watch your step here. Come on.
Your silk shirt!
If you hear a lot of screamin', don't pay no heed.
One of the miners has delirium tremens every now and then.
His name's Smith too.
Maybe you're related!
There's two ways you can have the windows - open or closed.
Closed is hot.
Open, there's flies that eat you alive.
- Let me help you unpack.
- Never mind.
No trouble. No trouble at all.
What's them?
I grabbed the wrong suitcase.
- What are these things?
- That's a Kewpie doll.
I won one at the state fair the time I went to Denver all by myself.
- And got rolled by some floozie!
- Oh, shut up.
Now, stop it. Let's go ask
Martha Perkins about this man.
- Have you got change for a $100 bill?
- No, I haven't.
I'll get it changed someplace and pay you when I get back.
Patience Barton, you get away from there!
I could tell by that stupid face he would have no imagination. Smith!
You couldn't expect him to go around signing his own name in his business.
Ah! Patience Barton, you give me my key back.
Mister!
Wanna buy a pair of spurs?
No. I wonder...
These ain't hardly been used.
Gotta lot of wear left in 'em.
Outlast a dozen horses.
I don't ride.
Has this town got a doctor?
Big husky fella like you.
What do you need a doctor for?
Well, I'll tell the doctor that. If I tell you,
I'd just get tired of repeatin' it.
Has this town got a doctor?
I don't know what I'm gonna say to the man when he sees this suitcase.
- You'll think of somethin'.
- Might have a secret compartment.
I been through it three times.
I told you, he got the wrong suitcase.
Oh... I'm telling you, the man got the wrong suitcase.
You let go of me!
Hey, Pa, make him let go!
I got him! I got him, Pa.
Did you promise to marry that girl, or somethin' of the sort?
Not even somethin' of the sort.
I don't rightly know the lady.
I stand with a bunch of fellas in front of the saloon. She walks by.
I said "Does your mother know you're out, Cecilia?" Witty, like.
She was gonna blow us to kingdom come.
So many fast-weavin' cowboys.
She just likes to shoot people.
It seems to be all clear.
- Where did you say that doctor was?
- I still don't see what a big, healthy fella...
He's probably shootin' pool in the saloon.
- At one in the morning?
- This is a real upside-down town.
They've got three shifts of miners and they come on and off work all day.
- He answers to the name of Doc Schultz.
- Thanks.
- Sure you don't want to buy the spurs?
- No.
Hey, a cowboy's got to be pretty down to be willin' to sell his horse irons.
My horse went first, then my saddle.
But I'm sober now.
What I've got left is these here spurs... and a mighty empty belly.
Oh, well, here. You eat on me, huh?
Thanks, friend. The name's Jug. Jug May.
- Latigo Smith. Now, you enjoy your food.
- I can't thank you enough.
Don't cry.
Money's the least of my troubles.
$100? Mister, you gave...
I ain't never even seen one.
I...
I ain't never even seen a...
If I hadn't been hurried, I could've gotten him right between the eyes.
- You don't take after your sainted mother.
- I hate this town.
If I don't get back east to Miss Hunter's
College on the Hudson River, New York,
I am gonna hate it a whole lot more, and everybody in it!
Well, you ain't exactly loved by one and all around here.
- Enough, Oriville!
- Can't you do anything with her?
This is a family matter, Martha Perkins.
I'll thank you to stay out of it! Come along.
18, black and even. Everybody wins again. Care to place a little bet, sir?
- You lookin' for trouble, mister?
- No, sir.
Do I look dim-witted enough to play that game?
Against the house rules to answer that kind of question, sir.
Howdy. Do you play pocket billiards?
- Not now. Are you Doc Schultz?
- Says so on my licence.
Toss me that piece of chalk.
Thank you.
Listen. If a man tells his lawyer that he killed a gent or two, the lawyer can't tell anybody?
I don't see how that concerns me, but you're right.
The relationship is a sacred one.
The same with a doctor. A doctor can't tell anybody what anybody's got.
You must have a very interesting disease.
- It's worth $500 to you.
- Getting more interesting by the minute.
Of course, I'll have to blow your head off if you tell.
I ain't never seen leprosy.
If that's what you've got, I wouldn't know.
It ain't leprosy, but can't we go someplace where we could be alone?
Well, that sounds like a sound idea.
My office is right up the street there.
Gonna change your mind about a bet, sir?
Have to be an idiot to play roulette.
Do I look like an idiot?
- No, sir.
- And don't you forget it.
Fire in the hole!
- What the hell was that?
- Third shift.
First and second set the dynamite charges and fuse them.
Third does most of the blasting.
Sometimes this goes on all night.
Purgatory sits on the top of two mines.
Barton owns one, Colonel Ames the other.
Been fightin' each other trying to tunnel to the mother lode for two years now.
- The mother lode?
- Centre of town, according to geologists.
Like buildin' a railroad from east and west.
Whoever gets there first gets to drive the golden spike.
- And the other one gets the shaft.
- Gets the shaft.
Yah!
She shoots at people, too.
Nicest girl in town.
I sure am curious about that ailment of yours.
- This is your office?
- I doctor pack mules too.
Got a pain in the ass?
Come and see Doc Schultz.
This is better now. Well...
What's your problem?
Doc, you promise you won't tell anybody, huh?
On my hypocritic oath.
- In all my born days!
- I was a little drunk at the time.
I could've guessed that.
Where's the young lady now?
Never mind. Can you take her off, Doc?
- You mentioned $500.
- Cash.
Well, if I ever knewed anything about tattooin', I've forgotten it.
I'll have to read up on the subject.
You're gonna be around a few days?
Just long enough to get this thing off, then I'll be long gone.
You ain't runnin' away from the lady?
No, of course not.
But if she should show up, you haven't seen me, huh?
- How would I know her?
- She's got a lot of this gold-coloured hair.
She's got a lot of everything, but mostly she's got a lot of this gold-coloured hair.
- What shall I do?
- Come back in a couple of days.
- That'll give me time to read up.
- Well, you're the... doctor.
Just a minute, I'd like to speak to you.
I don't know you, mister, and I don't see any reason to start.
I want to offer you very profitable employment.
I'm in business for myself.
Doc! Who is that fella?
None of your business. Speaking of which all you mine-owners are a despicable lot.
You hire people to kill people that other people hire to kill your people.
And you go elsewhere with your medical business and I have to doctor jackasses.
Get outta here. I got business to attend to.
Anybody ever tell you you've got a rotten bedside manner?
- Out!
- You talk too much. I can't understand.
Hey...
Like to place a bet, sir?
Sorry, sir, I didn't know it was...
Ask me that one more time,
I'll put a plate in your skull.
Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir.
- Sarsaparilla.
- What?
I would write it down but I don't figure you could read it. Soda pop.
- Don't hardly anybody want soda pop.
- Don't you drink?
Only to be sociable.
And I don't feel sociable right now.
Dimwits.
- Who?
- Idiots playing roulette.
- Oh! Some people like it.
- Suckers. The worst kind of suckers.
The house gets the best of it.
No, they oughta take all the roulette dealers out and string 'em up.
House got eight per cent the best of it, even if the wheel is straight, and it ain't.
Eight per cent! That means that one out of every 12 times you haven't got a chance.
Anybody who plays roulette oughta have their head examined. Just lock 'em up.
They oughta burn all roulette wheels.
$4600 on number 23.
- Mister, I can't take that kinda money.
- 4600 on 23.
Boss!
Boss, this fella just bet $4600 on number 23.
Spin her.
Number 22. The man loses.
It just comes over me every so often.
Nothing I can do about it.
Number 23 just pulls at me.
Well...
- They say money isn't everything.
- Is if a man's hungry.
That reminds me. How much you got left of that $100 I gave you?
- None.
- None?
I ate up $20 of it. I bought a girl some wine. She had a sick mother in Salt Lake...
- You gave her the money?
- Seemed like the thing to do.
You idiot! That's the surest way to make an enemy out of a woman.
- It is?
- I learned that a long time ago.
- You did?
- Well, let's take a walk.
I need the air and time to think.
- Young man, about that job...
- I told you not to bother me, mister.
- The man said something about a job.
- I don't like to work. It tires me out.
- How are we gonna eat if we don't work?
- We?
I figured we'd ride together.
- Ride? Horses?
- Yeah.
I told you, I don't ride. I'm a train man.
At least carriages.
A man has got to be numb on both ends to earn his livin' sittin' on a horse.
- I just don't like horses.
- That's close to treason in these parts.
Lively place.
This is a two-shaft town.
Only one of them works full time.
- Half the jackass miners drink in places...
- A woman run that saloon?
- Hm?
- Does a woman run that saloon?
Miss Jenny.
You still got them spurs you was trying to sell me? Give me them.
- You threw one away.
- I did just that.
- Open up another table.
- Yes, Miss Jenny.
- Miss Jenny?
- That's right.
I brought you this.
- From Slim.
- Is this a joke?
Ma'am, I rode over 300 miles to bring you that spur.
It's hardly a jokin' matter, a poor boy dyin'.
Just me and him out on the prairie all alone, the wolves howlin' in the distance.
"Lat" he said to me.
"There's nothing I got left in this world except this one spur. "
"I want you to take it to my only true love,
Miss Jenny. "
Of course, I knew who he was talking about right off.
All those lonely nights on the trail, he'd hardly ever talk about anything but you,
- and what a heart of gold you had.
- I kinda remember.
There must've been a Slim.
Oh, bartender!
Give this gentleman a drink.
- Is that other boy with you?
- Yes, ma'am, I am. My name's Jug May.
Give them both a drink, and I'll have one.
About this Slim.
He was in love with me, is that it?
Ma'am, there was never a truer love, nor nobler.
Of course, I can understand why the boy felt that way.
- Oh?
- Yes, ma'am, I can understand.
"Miss Jenny," he said,
"she's not like other women. "
He said that real often. "Miss Jenny, she's kind and generous to a fault. "
"Just give a man her last dime. "
- You're not lyin' to me?
- May I be struck down if...
- You all right?
- If that's the third shift, I am.
Sorry. Sometimes it comes without warning.
Getting back to Slim. He really said those nice things about me?
Yes, ma'am. Even dying, he said them nice things, and more.
- I'm touched.
- Not as much as you're gonna be.
There's a name for a man like that.
- Mornin', Patience.
- Mornin'.
- Looks nice.
- Thank you.
Try this.
Oh, I like it. We'll take this one.
You sure got good taste in pickin' hats,
Miss Jenny, just like everything else.
It'll embarrass me, you paying.
Let me have the money.
You just stand there and be embarrassed.
I'll pay the man.
- Boy, have you got brass.
- Hm?
Asking a woman for money like that.
- You think that's wrong, huh?
- The way I was brung up...
- A woman brought you up, didn't she?
- Yeah.
You see?
I mean, it ain't generally done.
Did you ever know a woman to show any slowness in askin' you for money?
No, now that I think about it.
I just made one mistake, though.
Askin' her in the daylight.
Come across much easier at night.
Hm...
- Morning.
- Morning.
- You buyin' yourself a new hat?
- No, the lady's buyin' him one.
Is it gonna make or break your day if I do or don't buy a hat, stranger?
Oh, I don't want to be a stranger to you.
My name's Colorado. Colorado McGee.
Well, you said that like you expected
I should have heard of you.
I never have, so what do you want?
I wanna know if you're as fast as they say you are, Swifty.
- What'd you call me?
- Swifty.
I'll call you Mr Morgan if you like.
I'm goin' out in that street and wait for you to come out.
If you don't, me and everybody else in town is gonna call you a yellow dog.
- Gunfight?
- You catch on.
Well, you just go on out there.
I'll be out on the count of ten.
- You hit that fella from behind.
- Just as hard as I could.
- Get me one of those irons over there.
- What's that gunfighter got against you?
I never saw him before in my life.
Oh, Miss Jenny. I'm awful sorry that a lady like you had to see a crude thing like this.
Let's go up to the hotel and get some smelling salts and you can lay down.
From the way this guy is wearing his gun in his holster, looks like he's left-handed.
It was his right trigger finger you busted.
Miss Jenny, would you turn your head, please?
Give me the iron.
If I'd known you were gonna send this pipsqueak against Swifty Morgan.
- Look, Mr Barton...
- Don't take offence, lad.
But you've never killed anybody outside of this county. You're just local stuff.
Swifty Morgan is known from Canada to the Mexican border.
If you've got a better idea, Taylor, let's have it.
- Buy this Swifty Morgan.
- Ames has already bought Morgan.
All gunfighters have a price.
They're a low order of humanity. Lice.
- Look here, Mr Barton.
- Shut up!
We offer Morgan enough money to make him double-cross Colonel Ames.
- That sounds good.
- Now, wait a minute.
How can you be sure that Colonel Ames sent for Morgan?
I have a way of knowin' what goes on in the Colonel's house.
- He's sparkin' his old-maid sister.
- Why, you young...
I seen you out bicycle-ridin' with his sister propped up on the handlebars.
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves, actin' like that at your age.
Set an example for young people instead of carryin' on like a randy old goat.
Her lookin' like a winterkilled persimmon.
- Get him outta here.
- Kid, get out.
All I can say is I'd hang my head in shame was I kin to you...
Pipsqueak!
I figure we can hire Swifty away from Colonel Ames for $5,000.
That's a lot of money.
We'll lose a lot more if we don't get to the mother lode first.
We'll never get there if we don't get back down to diggin'.
As treasurer of the company, this calls for a meeting of the board of directors.
- We are the board of directors.
- I move that we spend the 5,000.
- I second the motion.
- You can't, you're chairman of the board.
- There is parliamentary procedure.
- Ames ain't worrying about procedure.
He's got four gunmen sittin' on top of our mine, keeping us out of the ground.
He'll keep keepin' us out till we start fightin' fire with fire.
Taylor!
Look.
- Colonel Ames.
- He walks like he owns the town.
He will if we don't hire Swifty Morgan.
Last time I wore that dress was at the governor's ball 20 years ago.
This hat... There wasn't a man nor a bird dog in Purgatory that didn't point when I walked down the street.
Do you think
I look like a lady of the evening?
- What's a lady of the evening?
- Miss Abigail, you do lead a sheltered life.
Do you think I could pass for one of those girls at Miss Jenny's?
- You mean a dance-hall girl?
- Dance-hall girl.
- I wouldn't know. I've never seen one.
- They go past your window every day.
I always keep the shades drawn when they do.
- Where am I gonna put this?
- There's room back...
- What on earth?
- I'm gonna do me some blasting.
- In Jenny's place?
- In Jenny's place.
- You're not gonna get yourself in trouble?
- No, but I know somebody who is.
Wait.
For you know who.
Miss Abigail, I don't know why you're so dead set on marryin' my pa.
He ain't very smart and he snores somethin' awful.
Don't be indelicate, dear. Your father has characteristics that you don't recognise.
Also, such a marriage would give my dear brother apoplexy. Drat his soul.
Abigail?
Speak of the devil.
The servants tell me that Barton's horrid daughter has sneaked into this house.
- Open up!
- She's not in here, brother.
Stop banging on that door.
I insist that you open this door, Abigail.
Oh, very well.
Satisfied?
I will be when you stop sneaking off with Barton, riding that damn bicycle.
We haven't been riding in over a week.
Taylor's got a flat.
- He'll have more than that.
- You touch one hair on his head...
One grey hair. He's an old man.
- Snow on the roof but there's fire...
- Abigail! Have you no shame, woman?
What about you, keeping
Taylor's workers out of the mine?
How else will I get to the mother lode before he does?
His shaft is right in town.
I have to tunnel twice as far.
- That doesn't give you the right...
- Right? I'm talking about gold.
Gold! That's all you ever think of.
All Taylor Barton thinks about is courting you so he can spy on me.
And I tell him everything he wants to know.
- He's using you, Abigail.
- He sure is!
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.
- Who are you?
- I'm the new girl.
- You is?
- I just got in this morning from Frisco.
In fact, that's my name - Frisco.
Well, it's nice work. It has its ups and downs, but it is nice work.
- Beat it.
- Put 'em up.
- What are you gonna do with that?
- Kill you.
With that?
I'm a rotten shot and
I'm tired of missing you.
Do you mind tellin' me why you're shootin' at me?
So I can go to Miss Hunter's College on the Hudson River, New York.
- Put 'em up, I'm gonna kill you.
- Why should I put my hands up for that?
I don't feel right about killing you in bed.
Do you think you could jump up and grab me, then I'd get mad and light the fuse?
It's your Christian duty to tell me why you're going to blow me up.
- The mine.
- The mine?
If my pa don't get to the mother lode, we won't have any money.
If we don't have any money, I can't go to Miss Hunter's College, understand?
No.
- What's all that got to do with me?
- Don't play the innocent, Swifty Morgan.
- You know Colonel Ames sent for you.
- You think I'm the famous Swifty Morgan?
You're getting me angry.
If I get angry, I'll light this fuse.
I don't want to do that, but I am not Swifty Morgan.
Liar! Now, my pa is sparking
Colonel Ames' old-maid sister.
She told him that Colonel Ames sent for you, Morgan.
- What's this, a hold-up?
- Show her the inside of one of the boots.
- Huh?
- The inside of the boots.
I had those boots made in Amarillo over a year ago. Now, look inside.
Go on, look.
"Latigo Smith"?
$60 boots. A man certainly would have his name in 'em.
Well, you probably took them off some poor, dead fella that you shot.
Why, you're the Barton girl!
What you doin' here?
Your sainted mother was one of the nicest ladies in the Baptists.
Down the back stairs with you before anybody sees you.
You have not seen the last of me yet,
Mr Swifty Morgan.
Hello, ladies' man. "I love Goldie. "
- I warned you about that.
- Not to mention it to anybody else.
Well, I've studied up on tattooing.
I think I can do the job for you.
But in easy stages.
Gonna take a couple of weeks.
Whatever you say.
Doc, does that 500 have to be in cash?
Well, Miss Jenny's certainly got 500.
Then again, she's had a lot of experience with men like you.
- What do you mean, men like me?
- Give you anything but cash money?
Well, there's one thing that don't change about women.
That's the fact that they're changeable.
- Where'd you learn about women?
- I worked at it.
- Hello, Patience.
- What's wrong with him, Doc?
You know a doctor can't talk about his patients, Patience.
Doc, you and me are the only friends each other's got in this scurvy town.
What would happen if we got mad at each other?
Oh, he's just got a little trouble with his chest.
Him?
- He looks strong as a horse.
- You've taken a dislike to him, ain't you?
- I hate professional gunslingers.
- Him a gunslinger?
- That's Swifty Morgan.
- And I just started taking a likin' to him.
I'd have had him shot by now if Pa hadn't taken my Winchester away.
Patience, you gotta stop shooting at people.
If you wasn't such a miserable shot, there wouldn't be a young male here.
I heard you took a shot at Elmer Price yesterday.
- Why, he asked me to marry him.
- That's reason enough to shoot at a man?
Doc, you seen Elmer? Ugh!
- Good morning, Doc.
- Mornin', Elmer.
Mr Morgan.
- What'd you call me?
- We know you're Swifty Morgan.
We have a proposition for you.
We want you to double-cross Colonel Ames.
- There's $5,000 in it.
- Well, look...
- Cash?
- Cash.
So, you think I'm Swifty Morgan?
I look to you like the best gunman in the whole Southwest?
I knew it the minute I saw you. That sharp, hawk-like gaze, the way you stand.
I hate to say this, but that's Swifty Morgan.
Uh... Swifty, come over here.
Come on, come over here.
These gentlemen know who you are, there's no use denying it.
Now that's settled, he would appreciate it if you didn't bandy his name about.
He's modest, Swifty.
These gentlemen have a proposition.
I suppose it's all right if I handle the business details like I usually do.
You just go ahead and finish your game while I talk to these gentlemen.
It's all right. Go ahead.
- Keen eye.
- Killed 50, they say.
Exaggeration. 32, to be exact.
Suppose you spread your cards on the table, gentlemen. And the cash.
The cash is in my safe. And it's best if we aren't seen together too much.
You slip out and bring the money to my room in about 15 minutes?
- You called me Swifty.
- Short and friendly for Swifty Morgan.
That's who they think you are. They're willin' to pay to back up that mistake.
I'm supposed to pretend
I'm Swifty Morgan? Goodbye.
They're willing to pay.
- How much?
- A thousand dollars.
We'll split it 50-50.
That means 400 for you.
Seems fair. But I think...
No, you don't.
That's part of the deal. I do the thinkin'.
You stand around and look tough.
Stop that! I told you, you're not to reach for that gun, no matter what.
If somebody spits in your eye, somebody casts doubts on your mother, you refer the matter to me.
If I'm Swifty Morgan,
I've got my reputation to consider.
I've got me to consider.
Pride.
If you start thinking, the deal's off.
No $400.
I'm getting better. You watch.
If it ever comes to gunfightin', you'll never last.
- Sure you ain't fast?
- No, I'm slow.
It's just you're even slower.
They come sneakin' in, lookin' at the register, tryin' to find the room number of Mr Smith.
I tried to tell 'em I got four Smiths.
Thank you. We wouldn't want to keep you from your work.
I suppose, the way they come sneakin' in, you're another one of them gunfighters that these jackass miners keep hirin'.
I suppose they're gonna hire you so you can shoot some other mother's son and then some other mother's son can shoot you.
Martha, for the love of heaven, unhinge your jaw and depart.
You see now why I demand my rent in advance every day?
Another Smith. Just more of 'em comin' all the time, gettin' themselves killed off.
- The money, gentlemen?
- Is Swifty in there?
Yes. The money?
Before we go and talk to Mr Morgan.
A little superstition of his.
He leaves all the money matters to me. I thank you not to mention the transaction.
Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you, Swifty.
That was close. Don't ever come up on my blind side like that.
No, sir, Mr Morgan.
That's close enough. What do you want?
- I came to see the killings.
- What killings?
You for one. And those others.
It should be quite a show. After all, there's four of you and one of Swifty Morgan.
- I thought Morgan was on our side.
- There have been some changes made.
Morgan, he took the Colonel's money, then turned around and took money from the other mine-owners.
It don't sound like fair dealings to me.
I know you fellas will teach him that honesty's the best policy.
- You all look like mighty brave men.
- When's he coming, this Swifty Morgan?
Well, he should be along at any minute.
Here he comes.
You boys stay here.
I'll circle around, slip in behind him.
- I'll go with you.
- Hey, wait for us.
They ran away, Mr Morgan.
All four of 'em ran away when they heard you were comin'.
Act like you're disappointed.
Ran away, did they?
Well, I'm sure disappointed.
- They went thataway.
- I'll let 'em go. They learned their lesson.
I'm a peaceable fella, really.
- Unless I'm riled.
- Bravo.
- Here comes Mr Barton.
- You did it, Mr Morgan. You did it.
First time I saw you, I said "He is more than the stupid cowhand he looks like. "
I heard you say it.
Three cheers for Swifty Morgan who saved this town from that octopus Ames.
Hip, hip, hurray! Hip, hip, hurray!
Hip, hip, hurray!
Well, what are we waiting for?
Gentlemen, start your jackasses.
Let's go to work.
Swifty.
- Swifty! I'll see you around, huh?
- Where are you goin'?
- I gotta get somethin' off my chest.
- What if them four fellas come... back?
Don't crowd my gun, son.
- How long has he been like that?
- Ever since he heard about the gunfight.
Can't stand the sight of blood.
Come on, Doc. Drink it down.
- Don't you think he's had enough?
- It's his own remedy.
Has me keep it behind the bar in case he's needed when he's drunk.
Drink it down, will you, Doc?
"That no life lives forever;
That dead men rise up never;
And even the weariest river winds somewhere safe to sea. "
Boys, put him in my bed.
Be as good as new in a couple of hours, then he can take care of you.
Say, what is this strange sickness you got? Do you mind my askin'?
Just enough to bust you in the mouth if you ask again.
- Evening, Elmer.
- Howdy.
Silver dollars, Charlie.
And a pink lady.
Hear tell Taylor Barton's gonna throw a big wingding at the mine tomorrow night.
Gonna have dance-hall girls, music, the works.
- That's how I ruined my best Colt .45.
- Huh?
Man started talkin' to me when I didn't wanna be talked to.
Bent the barrel over his head.
Excuse me.
16, red and even.
Ball rolls. Place your bet, sir.
Number 14, red and even.
Place your bet, sir.
All bets down.
Six, black, even.
Boss!
He just bet $4600 on number 23.
Spin her!
Hey!
You missed one.
That post there. You missed it.
Why don't you get married?
Keep you off the streets.
You can go right ahead. I know just how you feel. I do the same thing often myself.
- You beat your head against posts?
- Not posts. Mostly the walls in my room.
Sometimes it's a tree, occasionally a rock.
- Do you play roulette?
- No. It's on account of this town.
Sometimes I feel like I'll never get out of it, and then I wanna curl up and die.
When I feel like that, I just want to beat my head against something.
- You don't like this town?
- Do you?
No, I don't like anything west of Riverside Drive.
- Where's that?
- New York City.
- On the Hudson River?
- Yeah, I was born and raised there.
- Tell me about it.
- Tell you what about it?
All.
Well, let's see. They don't carry guns.
They got a cop on every street corner to keep people from shootin' one another.
And they don't ride horses.
No, they got carriages and streetcars.
I think I'm getting homesick.
- Me too.
- You've never even been there.
I'm homesick for it.
I don't understand how you could leave there to come to this damn, rotten West.
- My mother's fault.
- Your mother?
"Go west, young man" she said.
She said it a thousand times.
I'd always been told a boy's best friend was his mother, so... here I am.
Frisco, Dodge, Lodestone, Denver.
Sure wish I was back there, though.
I thought you came out west for your health.
- My health?
- Your chest.
- My chest?
- Doc told me about it.
- He did?
- Me and Doc, we're real close friends.
- He wouldn't have told anybody else.
- You better not tell anybody else or I'll...
I'll kill Doc and you won't have another friend in this town.
I don't know why you're so sensitive.
A lot of people have the same thing.
- They do?
- People come out west for weak chests.
You don't cough as much as most of them.
No, I don't...
Fire in the hole.
Would... Would you like to take a walk, Miss Patience?
Oh... Are you sure the night air wouldn't be bad for your...?
Not bad at all.
No, not bad at all.
- Sure is romantic, ain't it?
- Yeah, it sure is.
Uh... Latigo.
That thing you have, is that contagious?
I mean, could I catch it from you?
No.
Not unless you...
- No, you couldn't catch it even then.
- Good.
I never thought I'd get to kiss a man who'd been to New York City.
I mean, actually, in person, New York City.
Say, did you hear bells?
Yeah.
I don't know what Miss Abigail sees in Pa.
He's as dull as dishwater.
"Good night, sweet prince. "
Good evening, sweet prince.
It ain't good manners to spy on people.
Is it good manners for you to pay clandestine attention to my sister?
My intentions are nothing if not honourable.
We share the same ancestors as far back as Adam and Eve.
I desire no closer relationship to you than that. Take him inside.
If Pa gets killed, I'll never get to Miss
Hunter's College on the Hudson River.
On top of which he'll be dead.
I see a situation here where an honest man could make a dollar.
- Come on.
- Where are you goin'?
Among my other bad habits,
I'm a Peeping Tom.
- Stop it! Take your hands off me.
- She kicks like a mule.
Taylor! My darling, what are they doing to you?
Nothing so far.
And what we do depends on you.
Oh, I wish I hadn't bought you that book on Napoleon.
- Colonel, this is ridiculous.
- Indeed it is.
But not for long, because one of two things is going to happen.
First, you will get your workers out of the ground and promise never to see my sister again.
- Or second, the other thing will happen.
- What other thing?
My boys will take you out in the swamp and put a bullet through your thick head.
- That's murder.
- I've studied law.
Of course it's murder.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna save your father's life and make an honest dollar. that book five years ago Christmas.
- Where do you think you're going?
- In there.
- You ain't.
- How are you gonna stop me?
Like this.
Let me give you some advice, my ugly friend.
Swifty Morgan's pal.
Sorry. I didn't know who you was.
Excuse me, will you, mister?
- Latigo.
- Evening.
Your window was open.
I couldn't help overhearing all the jabber you folks were tossing back and forth.
So I'll tell you what's gonna happen.
Light me. Me and Swifty Morgan will take over this trouble you miners are havin'.
The way I see it, the race to the mother lode is just that. A race.
Now, me and Swifty, we're gonna be around just to see that everything is run fair and square.
Let me get this straight. You and Swifty
Morgan, by the power of Swifty's gun, are gonna tell us what we can and cannot do?
Long-winded way of sayin' it, but that's about it.
You're laughing.
- I just thought of something very funny.
- Are you agreein', or what?
I don't see what else
I can do for the moment.
What about Miss Abigail and Pa? You're not gonna let the Colonel separate them?
Me and Swifty Morgan stand foursquare in favour of love.
You're laughin' again. Don't you think you oughta let the rest of us in on it?
In due time, young man.
In due time.
- Morning.
- Morning.
I've been up all night worrying.
- What about?
- Swifty Morgan.
What if he finds out I've been pretending to be him and comes lookin' for me?
- That ain't gonna happen.
- What if it does?
Jug... you let me worry about Swifty Morgan.
Butcher, what would happen if during that wingding Barton's throwing at the mine a dynamite jackass was unloaded in an elevator and accidentally blew up?
- The shaft would cave in.
- Take time to dig it out, wouldn't it?
- Probably hold up operations for a week.
- Maybe more.
What if Swifty Morgan catches us?
You let me worry about Swifty Morgan.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
You have to wait. This gentleman is first.
No hurry.
You have much sadness in your face, señor.
Just stop to think. You always get darkness just before the storm.
On the other hand, it never rains but it pours.
Every cloud got a silver lining.
Troubles never come singly.
- Are you gonna shave me or not?
- Si, señor.
The squeaky wheel always gets the...
- Jenny!
- Goldie!
- If you aren't a sight for sore eyes.
- This is call for a celebration.
A bottle of champagne, Fred.
Private stock. Sit down.
- What you doin' in town, dearie?
- I'm lookin' for a man.
The woods is full of them, the mines are, and the lone prairie is lousy with cowpokes.
- So take your choice.
- This one was very special.
Here's to us!
- Where is this man?
- I don't know. That's the trouble.
- He run out on you?
- That or he got misplaced.
It's hard to misplace 'em.
- This one was special, huh?
- Bottled in bond, 14-carat, the best.
Mine answers the same description.
From the minute this man walked into my place carryin' a spur...
- Spur?
- Just one.
He says
"Ma'am, I've brung this a long way. "
"From Slim - boy from Texas, dies in the prairie with your name on his lips. "
- How did you know he said that?
- Because he said the same thing to me.
Goldie, your man is my man.
They're one and the same!
You mean he's here in Purgatory?
Let's think of a nice, clean way to get him murdered.
- Ladies.
- It's him!
- It's my Lat.
- Let's keep the record straight.
I'm not your Lat. I'm neither one's Lat.
I'm sorry if I caused you any grief.
I'm sorry if I took your money.
But I'm gonna tell you something.
It's about love.
Love don't work unless both people give.
You gotta give till it hurts.
Fight!
Fire in the hole.
What's goin' on?
Lat!
Lat...?
Oh, Lat...
Boy, I tell you, Latigo, I just get plum sick that the Sidewinder almost bushwhacked you when you first come to town.
Not to mention hittin' you with that there chair. You hear that music?
Boy, there's people just dancin' in the streets over what you done for this town.
A man should spread happiness as he walks through life. Ow!
- Hey, y'all just as good as new now.
- Thanks a lot, Doc.
Lat, I got drunk last night to get up the nerve to have to tell you somethin'.
Somethin' I should have told you from the start.
I was gonna put jackass liniment on your chest.
Make you think that tattoo was comin' off, even though it wasn't.
- But when Patience got involved...
- Involved?
I just couldn't cheat the man she was gonna marry.
- Marry?
- The Sidewinder?
- That's what she told me.
- Well, she told you wrong.
Ow! Damn it!
Marry?
The Sidewinder?
Lat?
I thought I oughta see you face to face.
I hope I didn't hurt you too much.
I'm all right. The doc just said so.
- I just couldn't help feeling the way I did.
- I understand.
I mean, what if we'd kept going together, gotten married, and you'd been killed, and then I'd gone to identify the body?
I'd have looked a fool.
There you'd be, laid out, with some other woman's name on your chest.
- Wouldn't that be awful?
- I understand. Let it go.
Or went to a picnic and you got some ants in your shirt and you had to rip it off and everybody would see your chest?
I wish you did have TB instead of that damn, rotten tattoo.
I'll be damned. That's the first time
I ever seen the Sidewinder cry.
Well, she's a sensitive girl.
- Everything under control, Mr Morgan?
- Better be.
Or I'll know the reason why.
Oh, darling, isn't it wonderful? No more trouble between you and my brother.
I wish you'd known him before he started reading that blasted book about Napoleon and sticking his hand in his coat.
Let's dance.
You sure you know about blasting?
I got all my fingers and don't talk in a high voice. Let's get at it.
I don't like this.
What happens if Morgan finds out?
You let me worry about Swifty Morgan.
Take us down.
- You're not dancing, Mr Smith?
- That makes two of us, Colonel.
- I should be. This is a happy occasion.
- It is?
It isn't every day you get to meet Swifty Morgan.
- Could you point him out to me?
- There he is, right over there. That's him.
I'm surprised you didn't recognise him by the cold, deadly look in his eye...
- Thought of somethin' funny again?
- As a matter of fact I did, yes.
- Colonel, isn't it time you let me in on it?
- It's precisely the time.
- So that's Swifty Morgan?
- In the flesh.
But that gentleman has a beautiful head of hair.
Swifty Morgan is bald as an egg.
- An egg?
- An egg.
Surely, sir, you jest.
What action do you suppose Swifty would take when he uncovers that fraud?
That cow-nurse who is using his famous name? Oh!
I'll have to think it over.
I never sent for Swifty Morgan.
Just wrote out a few telegrams pretending to, because I knew my fool sister would tell
Barton I'd retained the famous gunman.
But I sent him a telegram today, telling him an impostor was representing himself as Swifty Morgan.
- Why aren't you laughing, young man?
- Somehow I just can't seem to make it.
My shaft!
- Take a week to dig that out.
- Maybe longer.
By that time, the real Swifty Morgan will be in Purgatory.
- What the hell does that mean?
- Tell them what the hell it means, Smith.
Good night, gentlemen. Good luck.
Latigo?
Look, Mr Barton, I know what you're thinkin' and... you're right.
There's a train pullin' out to Denver tomorrow night. Be on it.
Both of you!
Like I said, a man should spread happiness as he walks through life.
I think we've been spreadin' it a little thick.
Tickets. Tickets, please.
Ma'am?
- You got a ticket, mister?
- In my hat.
Say, aren't you Swifty Morgan?
That's right.
It sure is a pleasure to have you aboard, Mr Morgan.
Where are you headed?
Purgatory.
- Hey, you.
- Me?
You.
Give me a cigar, Charlie.
- Light me.
- There you go.
Stay out of this.
Light me or I'll stomp you.
- You're gonna let that...?
- I know what you're gonna say.
Excuse me.
Hey.
I'm not reformed quite enough to put up with slobs like you.
Bartender, sarsaparilla.
- I'm glad you done that. He told on you.
- He...
- He what?
- He told on you.
He told me them mine-owners gave you $5,000.
- You told me it was just $1,000.
- You got a right to be sore.
- I ain't sore.
- You're not? Why?
When you come along, I was hungry.
You give me a $100 bill.
I hadn't even seen one before.
Two bits.
- I haven't got any money.
- On me.
- Thanks, Jug, that's real nice of you.
- You fed me when I was hungry.
- Let's drink up and get moving.
- Where to?
Anywhere as long as it's away from here.
I ain't leaving.
Now, Jug, you know full well that the real
Swifty Morgan is coming to this town.
He's gonna put bullet holes in both of us no end.
Except for one of us - me.
I ain't gonna be here.
- I'll be here.
- Why will you be here?
- Cos if I run, people will think I'm scared.
- I'm scared. Ain't you?
Yeah, but I ain't gonna run.
What do you care what people think here?
- I got my pride.
- That won't stop a.45 slug.
You know somethin'?
You're the smartest fella I ever met.
- You are a minority.
- You aim high.
Saddle-poundin' jobs have never interested you none.
That's what I'm gonna do. Aim high.
I know I may not have too much of a chance with Swifty Morgan.
- But suppose I down him.
- Well, supposin' you don't.
The odds are about a thousand to one.
You'll just end up an unknown character under a wooden cross on Boot Hill.
Everybody winds up dead.
The smart ones try to postpone it as long as possible.
My mind's made up.
Jug, I don't want to be responsible for gettin' you dead.
Now, let's blow this town and live to be a ripe old age, huh?
My mind's made up.
It's my chance to be somebody.
No chance - that's what you've got. Swifty
Morgan is greased lightning with a gun.
I been practisin'.
You just snap your fingers when you want me to draw.
Oh, come on, Jug.
I'm slow, Jug, but you're the slowest.
Well, I might get in a lucky shot.
I got a feeling you're goin' on a long trip.
Now, why not go alive?
You don't have to stay. You take off.
As soon as that killer hits town, I'm cuttin' out that back door. Muy pronto.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Why?
You gonna do something
I might take exception to?
Oh, no, sir.
Not while I'm in my right mind, sir.
- I'm the stationmaster here.
- All right. So far, so good.
You're the stationmaster here and you're in your right mind.
- I'm also the telegrapher.
- Congratulations.
I know about the telegram Colonel Ames sent you and the telegram you sent back.
- How do you know who I am?
- Anybody could look at you and see.
There is a man that killed
40 other men in cold blood.
- It shows, huh?
- Plain as the hair on your... On a goat.
All right, I'm Swifty Morgan. Now what?
That telegram you sent saying you was coming to deal with the impostor...
- What about that telegram?
- I took it to the Ames place.
But the Colonel's sister grabbed it, ripped it open and yelled
"So that filthy rat is coming here!"
- Meanin' me?
- Begging your pardon, sir, meaning you.
She showed it to Miss Patience.
That's a girl.
- That figures.
- Miss Patience started yellin'.
"That filthy murderer, Swifty Morgan, is comin' here, and that boy that's been posin' as him has to get out of town. "
So I suppose this impostor took off as fast as a horse would carry him?
- No, sir.
- He didn't?
No, sir. Right now, he is down to the Eagle shootin' pool.
Well, now, here's what you do.
You trot on down to the Eagle and tell this faker to come out in the street.
You tell him that the real, genuine, 100 per cent, dyed-in-the-wool Swifty Morgan is waitin' for him.
Sir, I'd really rather not get mixed up in this if it's all the same to you.
It is not all the same to me.
- He's out in the street.
- Who's out in the street?
Swifty Morgan is out in the street.
The real Swifty Morgan.
When you go out, he'll shoot you so full of holes you'll look like a strainer.
He's real put out about you takin' his name in vain.
Don't go out there, you idiot.
Let's go out the back door.
- It's that time, friend.
- Yeah, I guess it is.
Lat!
- There ain't no ladies allowed in here.
- I ain't no lady. I'm Patience Barton.
- Swifty Morgan's out there on the street.
- I know. I was on my way out to see him.
- He ain't after you, he's after him.
- I got him into this. I'll get him out.
Listen, Lat, if you get killed, I'm gonna have to marry one of these local crumbs.
Patience.
There are some things a man can't ride around.
Then again, maybe he can.
I've gotta see this.
I've gotta see this.
You there, in the saloon.
This is Swifty Morgan.
- Come on out.
- I already am.
What the hell do you think you're doin'?
If I were you, I'd aim high.
If you hit this dynamite, you'll blow the whole town up. You along with it.
You tryin' to make a fool out of me?
- No, I'm trying to kill you, Mr Morgan.
- You can't gunfight sitting on your ass.
As a matter of fact, it doesn't belong to me. It belongs to Taylor Barton.
- I stole it.
- Like you stole my name?
- Sorry about that.
- Not as sorry as you're gonna be.
Swifty Morgan hits only what Swifty Morgan shoots at.
I'm sorry about that too.
Any time you feel lucky, mister.
Fire in the hole!
I shot myself.
Don't let me die with my boots on, mister.
Lat!
- He did it! He did it!
- He struck the mother lode!
- We're rich!
- No, ma'am.
The claim belongs to Taylor Barton.
His mule done it.
- You hear that, Abigail? It's my ass!
- Mine too.
- Lat!
- He's all right, honey.
Take more than a little dynamite to kill Latigo Smith.
- You said you couldn't ride.
- I said that whorehouse was a gold mine.
- The tattoo. It's gone. It's been blown off.
- The hell you say!
Now we can get married and have a picnic.
Boss!
Latigo just put $10,000 on 23.
I'm backin' his play.
Spin her!
I'll be damned. 23.
Sure is good to have Mr Latigo on board again.
Serve the champagne, Sam. But not till the folks have time to catch their breath.
Now, the way this story ends, those two go to Denver to get married.
Patience never gets to go to Miss Hunter's
College on the Hudson River, New York, but seven of her daughters do.
Taylor Barton, he gets his flat fixed and marries Miss Abigail.
The colonel goes broke. Swifty Morgan is still tryin' to get his boots off.
And me?
I go on to become a big star in Italian Westerns.
Oh, you Rio Grande!
Get in there.
V¡va Méx¡co!
V¡va Méx¡co!
This here's Mexican dirt. You can't touch me.
Thought you'd get me?
You're a disgrace to the Confederacy.
Speed, this ain't no time to let me down. Get up!
This is Mexican territory.
He gets across the river and his horse faints on him!
This ain't fair, goddamn it. This ain't fair.
This ain't fair.
Good Lord. They're stringing up old Speed.
I have here a very fine animal once owned by the hombre we're about to hang.
What am I offered?
Hey! I still own that horse.
When we want to hear from you, amigo, we'll rattle your cage.
Ain't that the horse that fainted?
Yeah, he fainted. But he got up, didn't he?
What?
What?
Towfield, I said keep these buzzards out.
Take it easy, Moon. You're lucky you're getting a decent hanging.
I'd have done it out there on a scrub oak.
Goddamn vultures hanging around here all morning.
They just want to see the man of the hour.
Well, I'm flattered as hell.
You're a real card,
Moon. I'm gonna miss you.
Your family's here. Make it short.
Boys!
Brother Abe, Jimmy,
Gussy and everybody.
Dumb-ass deputy. He thought you were really my family.
So I figured...
You look pretty as a painting, honey.
- How ya doin', Henry?
- Well...
...roll it out.
- Nothing like that, Henry.
- We just come to see you off.
See me off?
Doesn't look like you did too good on your own, Henry.
You should've stuck with us.
We was going places, goddamn it.
What do you mean, "was"?
All you gotta do is spring me.
If we tried anything, we'd only get shot.
Yeah, but that's without my plan.
Cut that out.
Big Abe, they're gonna send me to the bone orchard.
If you got anything you want to give away, Henry, now's the time.
Say your goodbyes, boys.
- Nice knowing you.
- Yeah, Coogan, sure.
It just ain't right. Just for cutting a few horses and robbing a few banks.
The law's gotta be changed, Henry.
Go on outside.
So long, Moon.
Adios.
Well, honey, at least we had some good old times together.
You was the best I ever had.
Except maybe that circus fella.
- Why does that always upset you?
- Why bring that up now, Hermine?
- Shit!
- Oh, Henry.
Don't worry, Moon.
I'm gonna take care of this girl like she's my very own.
- Come on, honey.
- Oh, Henry.
Mr Moon?
It's about that time.
- What about my last meal?
- You're smoking it.
Hands behind your back, Mr Moon.
He ain't for you.
I wouldn't take you to a dog fight if you was the defending champ.
You oughtn't to have done that, Mr Moon.
Well, why don't you keep me in jail for it?
- You tell him about the ordinance?
- No.
Why not?
People I don't like,
I don't tell nothing.
- Goddamn it, Towfield.
- What ordinance?
- What ordinance, Sheriff Pile?
- Kyle.
We got this ordinance here, passed after the Civil War, because a lot of our boys didn't come home and the women was chewing up the grass.
- I feel sorry for the grass.
- I feel sorry for the women.
This ordinance says any man, short of a murderer, can be saved from the gallows by any property-holding female, providing she decides to marry him.
They done that in Roman times, as I recall.
Sweet Jesus H Christ
Almighty! Ma'am! Ma'am!
There's a couple of things about me that I'd like you to consider.
- I don't need your insults.
- I agree completely.
But you've gotta take into consideration that a man...
...can get a little irritated...
...and act like the dickens when he's about to die.
- Buzzards, huh?
- Well, buzzards can fly.
And they keep the desert clean. I cook.
I cook like a sonofabitch.
I mean like the dickens.
- Hello, son.
- Go to hell.
I understand.
Henry Lloyd Moon, you've been found guilty of horse thievery and sentenced to be hanged.
Do you have any final last words?
Just this:
I wanna tell you good people of Longhorn, especially you lovely ladies, that the old saying, "You can't judge a book by its cover", it's true.
Some books are all scruffed up on the outside, but when you turn around and look inside, why, the words is just wonderful.
Is that it, Moon?
Isn't there anybody else got anything to say?
"The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.
"He restoreth my soul. "
That's not right.
"The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want.
"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
"He restoreth my soul.
"He leadeth me beside the still waters.
"Yea, though I walk through the valley... "
I'm a veteran of the great Civil War.
The only reason why I turned to crime was there wasn't no jobs.
Not one single job for a man who risked his life...
...for his country.
In the Confederacy!
This one's dumb, he'll swing for sure.
He's better off.
"And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. "
Bullshit!
Ready to go.
Stop!
I'll take him.
Florence! Now...
Don't you think that you're...
...a mite too elderly to take on a responsibility like this?
I've got a good feeling about him, Andrew.
The boy's a veteran. He deserves a second chance.
Somebody take this son-bitchin' blindfold off me and let me see my bride.
Where is she?
Florence!
Florence!
Mrs Henry Moon.
Let me look at you.
- Stand back, folks.
- Florence!
Stand back, please.
Just ain't your day.
Maybe she just fainted.
- I made her dizzy.
- Down she go, up you go.
Is she dead?
Then I'll take him.
Julia, what are you saying? He's an outlaw.
I assumed that's why you're hanging him.
Are you drunk?
Sheriff, you know I don't drink.
'Course she don't drink.
You want him?
The law says I can claim him, right?
I asked you out ten times. What did
I get? A flap of your umbrella. Shit!
All right.
OK, Julia.
Mr Moon, what do you say?
I ain't no side of beef to be auctioned off, but...
...hell, fine by me.
Well, I think I'll skip the wedding.
I ain't taking Frank
Towfield's business tonight.
Somebody's taking his business, or we ain't got no business.
Now, Mr Moon: no drinking, no gambling, no wife-beating, no alley-cattin' and what have you.
You've got to mind her.
If you try running, there'll be $500 on your head.
Well, gentlemen, much obliged to you. Much obliged.
Shall I take the reins, dear?
Adios!
See, I told you he had a plan.
You can dance in the air, you sonofabitch. Stealing my girl.
Miss, in case you want to know who you're dealing with...
...I used to ride with
Quantrill's Raiders.
You always this quiet?
When I have something to say, you'll hear it.
Well, look, I can get off right here as far as I'm concerned.
Of course, a good husband's hard to find.
You weren't hard to find, standing there with a rope around your neck.
Yeah. You sure are a smart woman.
I like smart women.
Sure you do.
Who's that?
One of the reasons we got married.
Hey, Rover.
That's Grover.
This is where I live.
Well, Julia. It ain't much, but it's a start.
Guess I don't get to carry you across the threshold.
Wipe your feet, please.
Always do.
Well... it looks like the opera house.
Please take your clothes off, Mr Moon.
Don't sit there.
Here, put these on.
These is work clothes.
That's right.
But I just got married.
Don't count on that too much.
This is a gold mine? In Texas?
It's gonna be.
Looks like mice bit into it.
First you'll begin crevassing, then cross-cut using the singular jacking method.
I ain't familiar with that particular method.
You pry away any loose rocks.
Are you watching?
Then you insert the drill.
Like this.
Then you use the sledgehammer.
Simple.
Where's the gloves?
My hands blister easy.
Better blisters than neck burns.
Mr Moon...
Pretend we're friends and call me Henry.
The railroad is breathing down my neck, so let's not waste any more time.
I'll do all I can do, but...
...that's all I can do.
I'll be outside running auriferous tests.
Why don't you run one on your skull while you're at it?
Supper's ready.
I don't believe in wasting time at the table.
How'd you come into this place?
It was my father's.
Did he believe in this gold mine?
He believed, but not enough.
Sounds like he was the brains in the family.
Boiled chicken?
Boiled is better for you.
How's about a little dessert?
I said, how's about a little dessert?
- I heard you the first time.
- You didn't answer me the first time.
Can I ask you a personal question?
When was the last time you had a man?
I hope you don't mind confined spaces, tomorrow we start tunnelling.
Goddamn, I should've known.
You can always tell a virgin because the whites of the eyes ain't clear.
I got this theory on virgins, that they...
...always look peaked and grouchy because they're going against nature.
I don't want to get calluses patting myself on the back, but...
...in my time I have put a gal or two in tune with nature.
I'm sure nature is very grateful.
Listen to me.
Don't let starting late bother you none.
Some of them late bloomers is...
I'll be outside in the barn if you feel like getting acquainted, or talking about tunnelling.
And remember, nature is the great provider.
Goddamn.
Well, good morning, Spot.
Could use some bacon...
Morning, miss. What's for breakfast?
Conserve your energy.
There's a lot of work to do.
Don't you worry about me,
I know how to pace myself.
If I want to...
...I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long.
Pace myself.
Where are you going?
I wanna...
...take a little Spanish pause.
That's one of the keys to pacing yourself.
You just go on trimming your wicks.
I can do this all day long.
I'm talking about all day long.
All day long.
Hey, lady!
Understand?
She sure is full of piss and vinegar today, ain't she?
A lot of literature on Philadelphia.
What's the fascination with the city of motherly love?
Brotherly.
I'm moving there.
- To Philadelphia?
- Just as soon as I strike gold.
I like it down there in Mexico.
Pace suits me better.
Slow days and fast nights.
What a pleasant surprise.
We saw lights and felt we weren't intruding.
Oh, Laurette, you're never intruding.
You all remember my husband, Henry.
Welcome to our humble abode.
We brought a little wedding something.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
How pretty.
We was just saying how much we needed a figurine.
- I'll get us some tea.
- Shall I help?
We'll help.
Don't be long now.
We felt you'd be needing someone to talk to. Especially now.
What Laurette is trying to say is that we all have so much in common these days.
We do?
We're all ordinance brides.
Oh.
Since you've never been married before, we all thought we should have a little chat.
Do you prefer orange pekoe or lapsang oolong?
You see, a husband has certain rights.
And a wife has certain duties.
And that's where the trouble starts.
Speak for yourself, Laurette.
You know, I rode with Quantrill. Finest revolver gang in history, till he died.
Quantrill died?
Last year.
That Shorty, he don't even ask. He just goes right to it.
Those outlaws just don't know how to take "no" for an answer.
Whitey is so funny.
Why, last night he got all painted up like an Indian.
And did he go on the warpath!
Say, want to have yourself a really wild time?
Why not dress up like an Indian?
That sounds like it oughta be Julia's cup of tea.
I guess I'll go on out and see how the squaws are doing.
I suppose what we're trying to say, Julia, is it's not as much of a chore as you may have heard.
But, if it should become one,
I have found that the best thing to do is just think about canning apricots.
Apricots?
Well, for some reason, apricots just seem to work best.
How are we doing, ladies?
Bye.
- Thank you for the lovely gift.
- Let's do it again real soon.
Nice folks.
They seem content.
Well...
...you know what they say:
"Lady love an outlaw like a little boy love a stray dog. "
We still haven't cleaned up that table.
You know, I was thinking about them chairs of yours.
Picking them up, setting them down through the air. Why, it's poetry.
Think I'm getting a headache.
Pretty soon, all over America, people's gonna be picking up chairs and setting them down.
It's gonna be all your doing.
Julia...
...what do you say we try canning some of them apricots?
"It would be like a man hauling with one ox
"and looking for two, hoping for the help of the Lord.
"Why not get rid of all the oxen
"and count on the Maker all the way?"
Very good.
- I look forward to hearing it
 on Sunday.  - Thank you.
Morning, ladies!
I sure did enjoy them canned apricots last night.
Julia!
What the hell was that supposed to be?
A joke?
No. You don't understand. A joke is when you make somebody laugh.
Miss Tate. Please step into the office.
It's Mrs Moon.
Excuse me. Miss Tate...
- Why, you...
- Henry.
I believe this is between
Mr Polty and myself.
Hey, Moon! It looks like the honeymoon is over.
What's the matter, Moon? You look like a dog without a bone.
- Hey, Hector.
- Si.
Why don't you go to the
Mexican side of town, see what the beans is jumping on?
- Beans?
- Beans.
You know, Polty's just another word for chicken.
Good one, Towfield.
- Who thought it up for you?
- Let's go chew the fat.
What for?
'Cause I'm in a good mood.
Well, how's about a little snort?
Hey, Peachy.
Bottle of mash and two glasses, Norvell.
- Not for him.
- What do you mean?
- Sheriff's orders.
- Sheriff didn't tell me.
You don't tell him nothing, so he don't tell you nothing.
Them's the breaks!
You know, I owe you a special thanks.
What for?
What for? Hell, if you hadn't jerked me back across the border to the...
...just desserts, so to speak, why...
...I'd never have been married to Julia.
Thinking on it that way, why...
...you sorta introduced us.
Yeah, Towfield... things is good.
You heard about matches made in heaven, didn't you?
- Well, I'm in one of 'em.
- Goddamn it, Moon! You stole my girl.
Take it easy, Towfield. You're wrinkling my good luck bandanna.
How's this?
You give me the bottle and
I'll tell you the truth.
You mean you was just japin' me?
She puts chairs up on the wall so people can't sit on them.
What?
I can't go into it,
Towfield, it's over your head.
But it's bad, huh?
Like eggs rolled in sand.
Duck out back for a snort.
Listen, amigo, don't ever call me a bean again.
What the hell was that?
Bye, Moon.
This is as hard for me as it is for you.
A year ago last Christmas Eve,
I had to move 150 Comanche souls off their sacred burial ground.
I know exactly how they felt.
What's the matter, honey? You look whiter than an albino.
You been bothering my wife?
We have 30 days to vacate.
- What?
- This doesn't concern you.
If it concerns her, it does me.
The railroad's taking over my land under eminent domain.
Eminent domain. Ain't that where somebody bribes the state legislature to take away some poor folks' land?
- I won't dignify that with an answer.
- I ain't asking for no dignification.
But I do find it interesting that you prefer doing business with the lady of the house.
Come on, Moon.
I'm sorry, Julia, but unless
I am advised otherwise,
I'll be out to survey.
You know...
...Polty's just another way of saying chicken.
Whoa, William.
They may be bold maids till they die
Oh, yes.
Mother says I mustn't Oh, George, please George, not just yet
Oh, yes. Swim, swim.
Be naked.
Oh, yes.
Oh, I love you.
Who's there? What are you doing?
Oh, Julia. I was just out here surveying.
You liar! You were spying on me.
Me? I never would do such a thing.
Help!
Julia. I swear on my honour.
I didn't see a thing.
It's not what you think.
- You old...
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.
- Are you bothering my wife again?
I was out surveying. There's my equipment. My tripod, my maps...
Caught you, didn't I?
I swear, no. I wasn't doing anything.
Then, apologise.
- I apologise.
- All right.
Now eminent domain your ass outta here!
Ooh, nasty!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why'd you stop laughing?
I don't know. Get to work.
I'd rather laugh.
- That's all you like to do.
- No. That ain't all I like to do.
No, Moon.
Ooh, nasty!
Damn.
- It's northern.
- Yeah.
Did you get stung?
Yes.
Did you?
Where?
Outlaws don't know how to take "no" for an answer.
What are you doing down there?
What are you doing down there?
What am I doing? I guess I was dreaming about tunnelling or something.
Out! You got me drunk,
I don't remember a thing.
- I didn't get you drunk.
- I will not have such talk here.
You tricked me!
I didn't trick you.
Get your clothes and get up, there's work to do.
Oh, I get it.
You're so afraid you're gonna like that, that you'll forget the gold and Philadelphia.
Get your clothes and get out of here.
Sonofabitch!
I was right. All these years!
Them painted ladies knows how to appreciate a man.
They don't got unnatural questions. "How did it feel?"
Dammit. I feel sorry for the poor sonofabitch that winds up with you.
Nice being married to you!
You haven't got a plug nickel.
You haven't even got a gun.
You won't get 20 miles before a posse'll get you and string you up.
I only slept with you so you'd keep on working.
I hope they hang you.
Not the curtain.
You wouldn't dare.
Well...
...I hadn't thought of it, but now you mention it, up in San Francisco I seen some
Chinese that done it this way.
The Chinese is an old civilisation.
They understand things about pleasure that I've never even thought of.
One thing's for sure: we ain't had a boring marriage.
Deputy, how can you do a thing like this?
- But 15 days? That's not fair.
- Tell it to the railroad.
- We've been here since '43.
- Them's the breaks.
Damn worthless black goo.
I was just going into town to buy an animal.
Now, gentlemen, let's not have no misunderstandings.
Me and the little woman haven't been getting along.
Don't go in there!
Where's the doctor?
What's the matter? Where's the doctor?
The doctor... Oh, yeah...
I never got there.
This pea-brain grabbed me and stuck me in a wagon.
It would've broke your heart to see it.
- You never told me about no doctor.
- You never asked.
Is something wrong, Julia?
- Female trouble.
- Oh, the vapours.
- I'd better put you to bed, darling.
- I just got out of bed, darling.
What the hell d'you pick him up for, Towfield?
- He was dressed like a Mexican.
- That's not illegal.
I told him.
Well...
Let's leave these two lovebirds alone.
I told him.
I told you but no, you wouldn't...
You missed me, didn't you?
I did not!
I can see it. Them eyes ain't angry. They're relieved.
And they ain't bloodshot.
- I wanted you back to work the mine.
- No.
You missed Old Man in the Moon.
Hell, I got my faults,
I admit it, but...
Hell, I got my ways, too.
I missed you a little bit, too.
I did.
When I was heading for the border, I couldn't stop thinking that nobody's ever saved my life before.
I just couldn't leave you in your time of need... of me.
It's been quite a day.
I'm a bit tuckered out. I think I'll take a poco siesta.
Oh, you don't have to sleep in the barn.
You can sleep on the couch.
Say when.
When.
Rats.
That's it for me.
I'm too young to die.
You don't understand.
I understand about dreams.
I understand about waking up, too.
I wanted to ride with the Younger
Gang, they wouldn't have me.
Claimed I wasn't cut out to be a Younger.
My feelings was hurt, but I accepted it.
You know, for an outlaw you've been a pretty good friend.
What's the matter?
Gold!
Good Lord Almighty, I found gold!
Watch out.
Don't knock into none of these beams.
I know it's around here somewhere. I can feel it.
I don't see nothing.
It's here. Believe me, it's here.
Goddamn!
Oh, goddamn! Look at that, gold.
- It's all over everything.
- Moon, I told you. Didn't I tell you?
Honey, kiss me. I'm rich.
Goddamn, I am rich!
You wait long enough, and pretty soon down it's gonna come right on you.
Like a wall full of Mexican teeth.
You know, I'm gonna get my initials put on my saddle in gold.
They like it that way down there in Mexico.
All we gotta do now is deposit this first bunch in the bank and then...
We? What do you mean, we?
Just that, in all fairness, I played a part in striking the gold.
You never believed it existed.
But you'd've never struck it if it wasn't for me. Correcto?
So?
So, where's my share of the stake?
You're right.
I'll give you ten percent.
You don't understand. You see, sharing is giving to each other.
Fifty percent.
We'll talk about it later.
All right, all right.
Twenty-five percent and we can stop this conversation right here.
Must be funny depositing something in a bank, huh, Moon?
Yeah, it's a whole new experience for me.
We're sorry to have you and Miriam leave us.
Thank you.
What with the railroad and this black stuff springing up everywhere, a man just can't grow a decent ear of corn.
Awful heavy for figurines.
It's my whole collection.
- I'll guard it with my life.
- You can do better than that, Whitey.
- Henry Lloyd Moon in the bank.
- Want one of these?
Sure.
Goddamn it. I like being rich.
Maybe now you can buy your way into the Younger Gang.
Darling, I think I'll buy me a little cantina south of the border.
Time to start living the good life.
Goddamn it, honey.
I'm gonna be a patrón.
Tequila, cards, señoritas.
Hey, wait till the Dominguine sisters get a load of me!
Don't do that, you're acting foolish.
Maybe you oughta try it.
You want to see something foolish?
That's foolish.
Fifty percent?
You're gonna give me fifty percent?
We're partners, aren't we?
Well, if you're gonna put it that way, yeah.
I don't know how to say this, Henry.
But...
...I think I got...
...greedy and selfish living alone so long.
Well...
...that's how you get.
Once you get started...
...you don't hardly ever get out of it.
For calling me Henry.
- Friends of yours?
- Used to be.
- What are they doing here?
- Good question.
Well...
Sorry to keep you waiting, but...
...me and the missus was playing fish.
Thought we'd stop by and bring you a little shivaree.
- Did you?
- Since we ain't been formally invited.
Well, me and Julia was just saying the other day how we was...
...gonna have you all out.
- You sure got your wish, didn't you?
- I damn sure did.
- Ain't you gonna ask us in, Henry?
- Why, sure, honey pie.
- Don't you know how to wipe your feet?
- Hey, old Coogan. Wipe your feet off.
Hope you like taffy.
It was my idea.
Thank you.
They call me Big Abe.
Ol' Henry still snore in his sleep?
I want them out of here.
- Not as much as I do.
- Moon!
You want them to find out about the dust?
Well...
Anybody hungry?
Hungry? Shit, I could eat a frozen dog.
Well, we'll go to the kitchen and see if we've got one already froze.
I wouldn't eat no frozen dog.
A feast fit for a king.
That's his speciality. Them pork bellies make it tasty.
Did you know Henry used to cook for the Raiders?
He cooked for Quantrill's
Raiders? No, he never told me that.
I bet there's a lot he never told you.
Shit!
Goddamn, Abe. There's ladies present.
Easy, you'll loosen my molar up.
Just play along a little while longer.
You go, I don't want to spoil your fun.
I ain't having a good time, I swear it.
Just trying to throw them off the track.
Wouldn't be me if I wasn't acting wild.
Forget about all this and go and have a good time. Act foolish.
Shit.
This ain't no real marriage.
Come on. Meet me tonight, huh?
I'll give you my old coyote call.
Remember?
Not now.
Anybody seen my goddamn molar?
No.
But if I do, can I put it under my pillow for the tooth fairy?
You won't get nothing for it.
Come on boys, let's help Big
Abe find his goddamn molar.
Wait, I have a better idea.
Moon, let's go and buy Big Abe a whole goddamn set of gold teeth.
You'll ruin everything, acting like a fool.
I don't give a goddamn what anybody says, I'm a gentleman.
And I'm not gonna throw up in this house,
I'm going outside to throw up,
'cause I respect your house.
Big Abe, you can throw up in this house any old time.
Goddamn gold, that sonofabitch is keeping gold from us.
Got no money! Sonofabitch!
You almost spilled the beans.
Come on and help me find Big Abe's molar.
Didn't I tell you to watch what you was doing? You don't understand outlaws.
I understood you when you told me to act foolish.
I didn't tell you to get drunk and sing your head off.
- Hog liked my singing.
- That's why they call him Hog!
Damn, Hermine!
Quit that goddamn coyote calling, I'm here.
You're wife's acting terrible, ain't she?
No, she's just had a little too much bug juice.
Now I figure you ain't had much of anything in a long time.
How come you and the boys decided to stop by tonight?
I wanna make it real good for you, Henry.
Hermine, you ain't hearing my question. God!
- What was it?
- I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
I appreciate the coyote calling
 and all, but...
... I told you, things have changed.
Crawl in, Henry, and see what I got.
You ain't hearing me.
I seen what you got.
It was swell. We had some times together I'll never forget.
But Hermine, now I'm took.
Hold it. That's enough.
- Don't shoot.
- Vamoose.
If I was monkeying around, would I still have my clothes on?
Then why'd you go out there?
Don't make no difference.
No matter what I say, you won't believe me.
Go ahead.
Well, I was just trying to get information off of Hermine.
That wasn't all you wanted to get off of her.
All I wanted to know is if they knew anything about the gold.
You care more about the gold than about me.
That ain't true.
I could've done what you think I done, but I didn't.
I don't believe you.
I was there strictly on business.
You want that woman! Take her, but forget about the gold.
People can't afford business partners that cheat on them.
- We made an agreement.
- And I'm breaking it.
- You can't do that to me.
- I just did.
That tears it. Gotta put the old double X to Henry Moon, huh?
Well, we'll see.
Now, you want your gun back, Moon?
Where's the goddamn gold?
- What gold?
- That gold right there, where is it?
You aren't quite as ignorant as you look. Come on in.
- How much we got here?
- Enough.
Actually, I was just coming looking for you boys.
Sure you was.
We're gonna hit the Longhorn bank.
There ain't nothing in that chickenfeed bank but sun-filled windows.
- And all the little lady's gold.
- Let's hit her in the morning.
- Not yet.
- You got a plan?
I'm gonna make that woman sorry she ever said, "I do. "
- He's hiding something.
- I don't think so.
- I know so.
- I knew he had a plan.
Me, too, but I don't know if we're in on it.
- Let's keep a watch on him.
- Come on, gang.
You better take a rest before your arm falls off.
You want some water?
Are you always this quiet?
I got nothing to say.
I keep my word.
Honey?
Honey, are you all right? Goddamn.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Watch it. That's it, all right.
- Can you stand there?
- Yes.
OK, there's a light.
- You all right?
- Well, I been better.
It's all right, nothing's gonna happen to you.
Here, hold this. You stay right here.
When I get back, we'll take a little Spanish pause.
Now...
Henry Lloyd?
What?
Nothing.
I'm sorry about last night.
I know it doesn't matter, but...
...if we're going to die,
I want it to be as partners.
Fifty-fifty.
We was a good team.
Good? Shit, we were the best.
- Honey pie.
- Moon...
...I been thinking, since we're gonna go anyway, why don't we go out in a blaze of glory?
Tie me up.
We're alive!
- I been watching you, Henry.
- Figured.
Ain't you up a little early?
We don't hit the bank till ten.
There's been a little change in plans.
I gotta tell Big Abe.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
I'll never forget you, Hermine.
You was the first woman I didn't have to pay for. Adios.
- You're a mite early, compadre.
- I wanna make a withdrawal.
Your wife will have to do that. Us ordinance husbands aren't allowed to.
- Besides, we're closed.
- You're open now.
Open it up.
Over there.
Hurry up, buddy.
Cover that up.
I never thought you'd do this to Julia.
It's the only way to save my marriage, Whitey.
Grover, where's Julia?
Damn.
Rocks.
Damn, honey pie.
Reach, Moon.
Mr Moon, you're still here.
Where's Julia?
Guess he ain't heard the news.
- What news?
- Your wife sold up to the railroad.
Gentlemen, start tagging the furniture.
- When?
- Does that concern you now?
Where is she?
I believe on her way to Philadelphia.
And you're going to meet Saint Peter.
That's right, Moon. You're going to meet señor Peter.
- We know you got it.
- I ain't got nothing.
We don't believe you.
- Ain't got what? Who's that? - The ex-Moon Gang.
They picked the wrong hombres to mess with.
Watch it, Big Abe.
OK. One, two, three!
- When did she leave?
- Why should I tell you?
About a half hour ago.
Now!
Moon, shoot back.
Yessum, this is mighty strange stuff.
Miriam dropped the lantern in some the other night, and the whole farm near went up in flames.
- Burned half the hair off my head.
- It stunk for two weeks.
The railroad has no use for it.
So I thought I'd take these samples East and maybe sell it.
What do you think, Miss Julia?
I'm sorry, Mr Standard. I didn't hear what you said.
Drop that gun.
Hold it there!
Hold it there!
All right, stay calm.
All right. Step down, Julia.
That sonofabitch can shoot.
He rode with Quantrill.
Come on. You've run far enough.
Come on, now. I'm losing my patience.
- You ain't taking my gold!
- Hey, they discovered gold!
No, they just had too much bug juice.
You didn't even write a note when you left.
What was I meant to write,
"Good luck Henry and Hermine"?
I was gonna explain everything...
Are you gonna rob this stage or not?
Burn the breeze, Kyle, or I'll blow everybody into feathers.
We don't desert our women out here, Mr Moon.
It's all right, Sheriff. You go on ahead. He's just trying to impress me.
Are you sure, Julia?
Well... you two try and get along, then.
We all had to.
My heart froze when I came home and you was gone, honey.
Let me help you up with it.
I'm not sure I'll ever get used to Mexico.
Why, sure you will, honey pie.
You got used to me, didn't you?
Anyways...
...first, let's get used to being rich.
The first time I saw this country, it had buffalo grass and bluejoint up to the stirrups.
By the second year we had
8,000 Texas half-bred cattle and over 3,500 volumes of
English literature in my library.
We just cut out the unbranded stock and divided 'em up between the outfits.
There was no arguin' over mavericks like today.
You got it good today.
Two per cent annual loss then.
Now it's seven from rustling alone, not to mention winterkill, calving loss, miring down in the spring.
How many are you?
Mr Braxton, did you see they sew old boot tops on the saddle to hold ammunition?
Pete, don't pester him if he doesn't wanna be pestered.
Well, it'd just be awful nice to know the whole story.
Well... it's beautiful country.
Yes, sir. It sure is.
You especially feel that now?
Yeah.
Sh, sh, sh.
I sure hope them sportin' ladies don't get sunburned.
I like 'em white as pastry.
Ladies.
Are we all set here?
All set, Pete.
Shall we start the horse... or will you?
I will, sir.
Well, that's one of them.
His name was Sandy Chase and he came here from Rhode Island with the army.
He was 24 years old.
We lost seven per cent of stock between spring and fall last year, to rustlers.
You always mention the percentage.
I wonder why you do that.
This is my fourth frontier and I know how they run.
I was in the California gold fields before I was 18.
I was at the rush at Alder Gulch and I went to South America.
These long ropers in the Missouri Breaks are a mixed bag.
Barbers from Minneapolis, failed grangers, Scandinavian half-breeds, wolfers and woodcutters, dishonest apprentices, raftsmen, poisoners.
You give them a chance and they'll waste everything.
You're astonished at my arrogance, at not even having a trial, aren't you?
Then why don't you get over it?
Our situation has become nearly as bad as it could be.
Honey, pull down Tristram Shandy again for me, would you?
Daddy.
Excuse me.
Come on! Giddap! Yah!
Got the gate.
How'd she go, Tom?
Everybody else been back a day.
Brought in about 14 head of the first-class order.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How was Wyoming?
It was fine.
Spent a couple of days in KC trying to keep from associating with criminals.
Why, they've hit the Union Pacific down there so many times the place has begun to look like a lawmen's convention.
They got two Pinkerton in KC and I do believe one of 'em was the legendary Charlie Siringo.
Did he claim to be a border cowboy?
Can't remember.
Said he could talk Mexican.
Yeah, that's him.
How'd you know it was a detective?
Rancher's wife wanting to go to bed with him. He kept givin' her a "no".
Damned if I can understand that.
- Well, I took care of her, Cal.
- You did that, huh?
You're damn sure.
Had a good time too, thank you.
Did you?
Spent the night in Martinsdale.
Couldn't get no credit at the whorehouse, so I picked up this chubby little girl off some sodbuster's outfit.
Yeah... How was she?
About like a Swiss clock. Same exact movement over and over again.
Yeah.
- It was Sandy, huh?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Sandy's gone. He's dead.
David Braxton's foreman...
What's his name, Cary?
- Pete Marker.
- Pete Marker.
...caught him and they hung him.
Goddamn it.
I knew somebody's bunch wasn't in that corral.
Little Tod was in town.
Everybody was at the hanging.
- How'd Sandy go out?
- Pretty good. Pretty good.
They hung him up on a cottonwood, though, and he sort of...
He sort of what?
Sort of strangled for a while.
Braxton was there dressed in a suit.
- Lookin' like God.
- Hah!
Goddamn.
I'll tell you, the first time I met Sandy...
Listen at this, now.
The first time I met Sandy, he was rustling on his own.
He had a stolen cavalry pony and he kept this dog.
As soon as he killed a steer, he'd cut the brand off and feed it to the dog.
He said to get enough evidence to convict him they'd have to pick through the dog's shit for a week before they could find the brand.
My aunt ran a laundry in St Paul.
Got strangled by a Chinaman while she's washing her dog.
It's easy to die. Easy!
Well, they sure killed Sandy.
He was the only comedian in this outfit.
Every outfit oughta have a comedian.
You can't run that many rustled horses across open ground.
I know I've been saying that.
But you can't.
What do we do, Tom? Open up a stand and sell stolen horses over the counter?
No. We gotta get a relay ranch halfway across so as we got somewheres to relay 'em at.
- That's right.
- That's just really great.
Only we ain't got a ranch.
We ain't got no money!
The only horses we got are out there.
We can't move them across the breaks without everybody knowing.
Let's just stick up the NP Railroad and buy a ranch.
Hell, let's rob a bank.
If we're gonna get hung for rustlin' horses, we oughta be robbin' trains.
Why don't you boys join that Hole-in-the-Wall bunch and you'll be around people that think like that?
Boy, a couple of years ago they'd have put Sandy in Red Lodge penitentiary, weavin' bridles.
Seems like there's something new in the air.
I bet you Marker'll bait crows with Sandy for a week before he'll cut him down.
I worked for that son of a bitch once on the reservation roundup.
He will leave Sandy in the trees.
When we was fightin' in Kansas, we had relays all over the damn place.
We relayed a cousin of mine all the way from Medicine Tree to the hot springs in New Mexico.
He beat the telegraph.
Took the detectives two years to cover the same ground he'd covered in a week.
And when they got there he was in his grave up on the Chama.
Why was you havin' to move this cousin around so much?
He did card tricks.
I get it.
He done a trick for this nigger on the Chama. The nigger throttled him.
Mm-hm. I see.
Say, Cal...
Why don't we put that relay in Braxton's backyard?
Yeah.
It beats sendin' three or four horses at a time out into Kansas.
The law there is pretty effective now.
I get a kick out of Little Tod.
He says we oughta rob a train.
No...
I'm tired, Cal.
I'm gonna turn in.
Tomorrow we have a nice day.
Too bad about Sandy.
All right, move over there. Move, move!
I want you to uncouple that car. Hurry up!
I can't do it. I'm not sure
I'm able to do it.
Just get down there and pull the pin out.
- I'm a clerk. I'm not mechanical.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
Whoo-hoo!
- Get the money out. What's your name?
- Nelson.
Nelson, you do this right, you can say you've seen Jesse James and lived to tell the story.
You're not Jesse James.
You ain't Charlie Siringo.
Just give me the money, Nelson.
- I'm not permitted to touch this.
- Gimme the goddamn money.
Whoa!
Gee!
- Don't start blamin' me.
- I am blamin' you.
This is it on trains. This is it.
God Almighty.
This is it. No more trains, Tod.
- I just don't wanna get blamed.
- Sh...
We got it! It's all over the place.
Yahoo!
We got it.
- You need some help?
- Just pick up the money, goddamn it.
Agh!
But they're all ones.
Tom, they're all ones.
- Where am I gonna put 'em all?
- I don't wanna hear that now. Just...
Ain't it just terrible?
The next time you mention trains, it's gonna get worse.
You boys new at this?
Appreciate your concern, Nelson.
Yahoo!
Let's get every goddamn one up.
Hey, look! There's tens in the water.
Get in there, Tod.
Get in the water. Get those tens.
Yahoo!
Little Tod...
Get out of my way.
Come on. Let's get outta here with what we got.
Mornin', my little darlin'.
Hey, Si. We'll see 'em in church.
I think all of you working men and women have had time now to consider this case before us.
- There's Braxton.
- I have reviewed its details, and now I feel secure enough to pronounce sentence.
Subject, of course, to your scrutiny and support.
Make him confess first.
I think the kindest thing we can do to this bird is to send him up to the territorial prison.
He's been about as cooperative as any prisoner we've tried around here.
- I see no direct call to hang him.
- Don't he look like God?
Who's got an opinion about how long we might send him up?
- Life is indicated.
- He'll take anything.
How would 10 to 20 sound to you?
Sounds about right to me.
How soon would I be eligible for parole?
In about two weeks.
Anything you'd like to say before we send you to your just deserts?
And if I may speak for the court, we would prefer that it be something colourful, life on the frontier being what it is.
Just that... it may seem to you boys like a hard way to make the papers, but I'm not ashamed of robbing that train, of blowing bridges, sticking up banks, or for my careless devil-may-care gunplay.
I'm not ashamed of pissing away the money on hard living either, because I'm that kind of guy.
But as a concession to me for my cooperation,
I would like you all to refer to me from now on as "The Lonesome Kid".
Especially in front of outsiders here in the West.
That's enough of that! Let's all go up to the bar and make fools of ourselves.
Yahoo!
Whoo! I haven't danced like that since Chicago.
I'm Tom Logan.
I'd like to congratulate you, sir, on your treatment of that impostor.
Oh... My daughter, Jane.
Hello.
People have told me
I should talk to you, Mr Braxton.
I just sold a family implement business in the Shonkin range and I'm thinkin' of buying a small ranch.
You done so well I'd like a piece out by you for good luck.
Well... the Cannon Ranch is for sale.
Isn't much. Four sections and a cabin.
Pole corrals around it.
But it's well watered, and pretty fair shelter.
The owner's living in town now.
Has a cooperage at the end of Main, past the livery.
I understand you had some rustlin' problems.
Seven per cent losses per annum.
You should know about that.
First year, that might just break you.
Mm...
I understand you had to hang someone here.
I did that.
Oh, that's tough.
What was this?
Some kind of a desperado?
No.
He was a thief, with probably a million good reasons for being on hard times.
The main thing is that we put him out of his misery.
Don't you believe in hangin' thieves, miss?
No, sir, I don't. Do you?
I surely do. How in the world else are we gonna have law and order?
Well, what do you know?
Maybe you can buy that Cannon Ranch, get started in the cattle business.
With your attitude toward human life, you may yet get to be one of the barons of this prairie, and have your picture on page one, or page three, of the Chicago papers.
And for your birthday you can have a big barrel of fresh oysters on ice, just the way the other hangmen up this way do.
You sound bitter, lady.
You should have seen that young man's face.
- He did not die quickly.
- I don't wanna hear about it.
I don't think you can really picture the man's face.
I don't want to hear about it, miss.
Thank you for your information,
Mr Braxton.
I'll go over to the cooperage and ask
Mr Cannon about them four sections.
Pleasure to meet you too, miss.
Welcome to town, now.
Damn, I feel better now.
- Damned if I don't.
- Me too.
Oh, God! You didn't cut him down yet.
We did! That's...
Whoa!
- Oh...
- Oh, Pete.
My God. They've killed my man.
- Si, are we gonna go to that whorehouse?
- Where the hell you clodhoppers been at?
File that. We got it.
Let's go for a ride.
I wanna go to a whorehouse, play cards, get drunk.
We can go to the whorehouse later.
Ain't you got no pride of ownership?
I buy you a brand-new ranch.
Do you wanna ride out and look at it?
Hell, we own it, we can go anytime.
Let's go for a drink.
- Let's play cards...
- Let's go to the whorehouse.
You're gonna have to pick and choose on that cos the money's about all gone.
- The money can't be gone.
- Well, it is and I'm glad.
- I'm glad too.
- Why?
Because robbin' trains is...
We start a pattern of robbin' trains and we're gonna get detectives.
From then, you can back the calendar down till they hang us.
That's why.
I still think we should rob a bank.
Rob trains, rob a bank.
- All right, let's go to the whorehouse.
- Mm-mm.
You here for a party?
- That's right.
- What kind of a party?
Well...
You got any girls?
Go on, Si.
The girls here can show you to the party rooms.
I like them ribbons.
Anybody want anything to eat?
Well, is he the one that I want.
You just come right on up here with me.
Where are the chubby ones?
I want a chub...
Oh, yeah.
Ain't that a match-up?
Ain't that a match-up?
Just like you and your horse, Little Tod.
- That one got away!
- You'll pay for that.
In my home town,
I'm considered a dangerous person.
Yeah? In your home town a man can get a bad reputation for smokin' corn silk.
Cary'll stay at the breaks, but somebody must tend this place.
I can tell you one damn thing, it isn't gonna be me.
Agh!
I got you! Told you I was gonna get you, you son of a bitch.
Here! How about this?
I like this place, Cal.
- Yeah.
- I like it quiet.
Cary, don't throw them tools down there like that, please.
I spent my first 18 years on one of these goddamn things, workin' for my uncle that raised me.
I worked myself cross-eyed too.
About the only thing I had for distraction was this dog.
I'd had the dog since it was ten years old.
And he shot it... for stickin' its tongue on a pat of butter.
So I stayed one more night.
And I killed his seed bull,
I rustled every damn horse he had including a racer that I sold as a cow pony to an Indian rancher, and I took the whole damn remuda.
I come within a hair's breadth of sendin' him to kingdom come.
I was that close to shootin' that son of a bitch in the brainpan.
I never did have that kind of background.
Never had nothin' neither.
My folks always wanted a place.
They was good people, so I always saw it with their eyes.
I can see that.
But when you think about it, you wouldn't want the weight of a damn place like this.
Do you do alterations too, ma'am?
Nope.
And I don't do your wire-ripped shirts neither.
There you go.
Si, you're beginnin' to sound like a real old lady.
What do you say we just jump this pissant seamstress?
You guys are soon gonna learn to treat me nice.
- Yahoo!
- Whoa! Watch it!
Come on! I'll kill ya.
Everybody's so scared of the Mounties that nobody even tries.
The horses are hardly guarded.
- You talkin' to me about Canada again?
- You're goddamn right I am.
Them Mounties scares me, Cal.
Hell, they scare everybody.
That's why it'll be so easy.
The Indians won't touch them horses.
We can take all 60 of them ponies at a walk.
All Canadian government brand?
Until we can get 'em to the breaks for modification, and then down here to relay.
That doesn't quite settle it though, does it?
No, it don't.
Someone's gonna have to stay here.
Well, it isn't gonna be me.
It's gotta be one of the two of us, and I'll tell you one thing.
You had all the fun on that train while I baby-sat these savages.
I'm going to Canada for sure.
That's settled. That's it.
I gotta stay on this goddamn piece of ground.
Goddamn! I can't even believe this!
That is pitiful.
You assholes will just get lost.
- He was the best foreman.
- He was the only foreman I ever had.
- Pete Marker was a hard man.
- He surely was, David.
He could break a horse better than the bronc fighters. He could do every job.
He was a great ramrod.
He personified the American West in the days of its rowdy youth.
- Sure did.
- Excuse me.
- Lee Clayton.
- Oh, my God, you gave me a scare.
- All I could see was your horse.
- That was all you were meant to see.
Is the owner about?
Who may I say is calling?
Lee Clayton. I just said that.
I have a short memory.
Well, I'll tell Daddy that you're here, and then I can get back to what I was doing before.
Tell him Lee Clayton from Medicine Hat,
Wyoming. Here on business.
- You got it?
- Yes.
- Come in. I've been expecting you.
- Oh, sir.
I don't know why it would not have tired me more than it did, to have travelled all this distance without more than a catnap.
You've a wonderful set of books here, sir.
- Yes, I have.
- Truly, truly beautiful.
I don't spend the time with them I should.
I'm of the opinion... I would only claim books that was about right from wrong.
Otherwise how are we to find our paradise among the stars?
True. Please.
Oh, sir. I'm sorry for your trouble.
I wasn't aware.
Gentlemen, Robert E Lee Clayton.
I understand that you hung a thief and neglected to find out where they were caching the stock. How was that?
He didn't wanna talk. He was about to die.
Oh, I see. Then you pampered him.
- No, sir!
- We hung that man.
Well, you pampered the man... you pampered the man, and the result of that is the loss of this poor man's life!
- Please, this is outrageous.
- You, you, you...
Take your hands off!
Realise the fact that as a result of that this poor man has lost his life.
If you'd invited me into the neighbourhood before, it wouldn't have happened.
You've got to give me some thoughts.
I'm gonna turn my horse out.
Then I'll wash my body.
And, miss... the only thing not on my diet would be the green top of the beet and okra.
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me, but I'm under a severe attack from a tooth.
Sir. Miss.
- Where'd he come from?
- What was all that about?
I got recommendations for this man from all the Wyoming outfits he's worked for.
- I'm assured that he's a top regulator.
- Regulator?
- You mean you asked him up here?
- You're damn right I did.
They killed my ramrod and I want them to pay for it.
I always wondered what Lee Clayton looked like.
And smelled like.
I always figured him to be a little fella.
He's supposed to have a Creedmore rifle he carries as a saddle gun.
Supposed to be able to hit out to 500 yards.
- Oh, Mr Rate. 500 yards...
- I mean it.
He never carries a side arm, so you know he's a dry-gulcher.
But he smells like a wet-gulcher and he dresses like a clown.
He don't have no wife, but he sure keeps himself spruced up.
Many a rustler has said his prayers when he got a whiff of them lavender bath salts.
- Daddy, I wanna know how...
- Not now. Shh!
- Vern, scat. Out of here.
- You betcha. I will.
- Adios, buddies.
- Send you a postal card from Canada.
Cal, why can't I go to Canada?
You gotta tend to the cabin in the breaks, Cary.
You don't hear Tom complainin'.
See you in a few weeks, Tom.
They'll be back, Buck.
Don't you worry about it.
Well, by gosh. Good mornin' to you, miss.
Good morning to you, Mr Logan.
You bought this place already, huh?
Yes, ma'am.
I guess that kinda makes us neighbours, doesn't it?
- Where are you headed?
- Oh, I'm gonna go over on the table.
Well, may I accompany you?
No.
- Why not?
- No good reason. I don't want company.
Come on. Give me a chance.
Give you a chance.
Give you a chance for what?
Miss, I'm gonna take this opportunity to be just a little damn bit offended.
Cos if there's anybody in this district who's got a right to think of themselves as wholesome companionship, why, it's yours truly.
If you're such a wholesome companion, what were you doing at the whorehouse?
Who in the world told you that?
Mary O'Connell, that little blonde you paid for.
Well, I hope that's all she told you.
She told me everything.
We're starved for news out here.
- All I ever hear about is grass.
- What's the matter with grass?
Samuel Johnson said
"A blade of grass is a blade of grass. "
- "Tell me about a human being. "
- I don't understand that.
It just means that Samuel Johnson was as bored as I am with nature.
We had a famous painter out here last year.
That man must have painted ten square miles of canvas, not one human face.
I wish he'd painted that boy Sandy hangin' up so decoratively against the mountains.
Because his pink tongue and white face would have set off the green of Montana splendidly.
I mean, it would have made the damnedest bank calendar you ever saw.
Well, you succeeded. This is where
I was coming to and you're still with me.
The persistence of the young rancher, huh?
- Well, I know what I want is all.
- What do you want?
I mean, I know what it is when I want something.
- Oh, come on!
- "Oh, come on" what?
- Why don't you just say what you mean?
- This is what I mean.
- Do you want me?
- What does that mean?
I mean you're followin' me around.
What you got in mind?
- Me?
- Sexual intercourse?
- Oh, my...
- Well, all right.
All right.
Come on. Get down off your horse.
I'm not gonna have any hesitation from you. Not from a frequenter of whores.
All right, all right. Just back off.
I'm gonna step down at my own speed.
All right.
I'm going to lose it right here, in all these blades of grass.
Do I have to come to you? All right.
- Hold it.
- What?
Who asked you to do all this?
- Well, your entire behaviour...
- Never mind that.
I didn't ask you.
You said that you wanted it.
- Well, do you?
- No.
- Well, you're not gonna get it.
- Keep the dang thing. I don't want it.
- I forgot. You do have your whores.
- Sure do. Like 'em too.
I'll tell you something. If you want them...
I keep tellin' ya. I want them a lot.
I don't want you at all.
Why are you bein' so mean to me?
People have neglected to tell you what a nasty little bitch you are, and I'm makin' up for their negligence.
I just seem mean.
I'm only being thorough.
If you're gonna start that, I'm gonna go home and shovel manure on the pansies.
Well, you just wait a minute because I'm gonna stop.
You gonna talk nice?
I will do my best.
You bastard.
- Can I have a kiss?
- No. I hardly know you.
Why don't we take a walk and talk about the Wild West and how to get out of it?
Well... all right. I can talk about that.
Cal, I forgot how to tie a diamond hitch.
- A squaw hitch is all you need.
- You'll be gone two weeks?
Give or take a few days. Cary, you're gonna move some stock to make way.
- No more than two...
- Or three at a time.
- I've been doin' this for a while.
- I reckon you have. Let's go.
Keep low, boy.
Hell of a damn way to ride off.
- Stay with your horse.
- Get a hold.
Si, stay with your horse! Si!
Goddamn it, he knows what he's doing.
Si let go of the rope.
Oh, Jesus.
- Help!
- You're gonna drown!
Help! Get me in.
We did it. We crossed that son of a bitch, didn't we?
I couldn't swim, but I was swimmin', right?
I can! I did it!
We deserve a lot of damn credit.
We crossed the Mighty Mo and I want some damn credit.
Supposin' if the catfish in that son of a bitch could eat a pig.
Or a chicken.
Get out.
- Easy, now.
- Tom!
Hey, Tom!
Huh?
You're the only rancher who hasn't met the new regulator.
Tom Logan, Robert E Lee Clayton.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, sir.
Damn near... sucked my boot off.
Pleasure to meet you.
Regulator - ain't that like a dry-gulcher?
That's not the softest term you could use, I'd say.
Well, a regulator...
Correct me if I'm wrong.
Isn't a regulator one of these boys that shoots people and don't never get near 'em?
That's it.
Well, what about the binoculars?
What are they for?
Well, I've taken to watchin' funny-lookin' birds.
I see.
Well, hell, I don't know.
I suppose if you didn't get a way off, a mile or so to do the job, you'd just get messy like I done here.
Easy, Tom. Don't let me down.
I've just heard this from all the other dreamers tryin' to ranch around here.
Lee, did you ever hit a man from a mile off while he was carryin' a pail of water?
A mile, well...
But I don't remember the pail.
No, sir.
When you hang a man, usually he has a chance to talk, or say goodbye, write a letter...
Besides, a Creedmore...
- It's a Creedmore, isn't it?
- It is a Creedmore, and a beautiful one.
Must make a pretty good mess of a human.
You hit a guy from 500 yards out, say, why, the suddenness of it, he don't have a few seconds to make his act of contrition.
And you never have to look him in the eye.
Right there, that makes all the difference.
I would disagree, sir. The thing that makes all the difference in the world is the fact that it accomplishes the task, you see.
This old boy in Wyoming...
Whoa.
This old boy in Wyoming, he sat down just to pull sandburs out of his trousers, and his skull suddenly flew into pieces about the size of your thumbnail.
That was the first time
I ever heard the term "regulator".
- That was the first time.
- First time.
What would be your line of work, sir?
I was in the implement business up in the Shonkin Sag, but I started back in the ranch south of here.
You started back in? You was before...?
My family used to have a place, but when they lost it I hired out.
Oh, I see.
I certainly wish you good fortune, Mr Logan.
The times are hard on a small operator.
Heyah!
I hope the damn horse thieves leave you something.
- I hope so too.
- Good day to you, sir.
Bye-bye now.
This colt of yours will be all right if you can find a wet mare.
- Is the mother dead?
- Yeah.
She got bogged down in a mire about a mile from here.
- See you later, Tom. Thanks.
- All right, Mr Braxton.
Damn those hands of mine.
Good luck, Old Sloppy.
Must have smelled something.
The closer you get towards Canada, the more things eat your horses.
Probably smelled a bear or a cat or some damn thing.
Either one would go ahead and eat your horse...
Whoa...
Damn! I don't know why they had to put Canada way the hell up here.
Well, hello, Jane.
Hello, Tom.
I didn't think I'd find you here.
- Why'd you think that?
- Cos I haven't seen you.
You thought I was gonna come courtin', didn't ya?
Maybe so. Mm-hm.
You was too harsh to me last time.
I never kick a dead horse, lady.
That sure is some garden you've started here. Have you had one before?
No. My aunt had one and I kinda took it over.
I ain't half bad at it though.
No.
Why don't you get down off your horse?
I will, thank you.
You're a lot nicer than you was before.
Why is that?
Well, you didn't come courtin' me like I figured you would, and...
I'm...
You're what?
I'm tryin' to revive your interest.
Oh, yeah?
Well... come here a minute and I'll show you something.
All right.
Now lift that up.
Close her down. Garden's watered.
I admire you.
Come in the house.
I'll make you a cup of chinee tea.
Chinese tea?
Northern Pacific Railroad.
Where did you get these?
Just souvenirs.
Mm...
How long does the tea take?
Five or ten minutes.
Can I come over there?
I'll come over there if you ask me to.
Let's go over there.
You sure about that?
That's right.
How do you know you're sure about that?
Well, why do you think?
Cos that's the reason why you come out here in the first place.
That's right.
This here tea's gonna get black as ink.
We'll write somebody a letter with it.
Let's write your father a letter.
Tell him that you're the prisoner of the chinee tea slavers.
Would you like to do this?
Yeah... I would like to.
That's what I would like to do.
Sorry.
God.
God, God.
Sniper, sniper, sniper.
Goddamn. They're pretty.
Yeah. They're neat little bastards, ain't they?
Oh, boy. There's more of 'em than I expected.
Yeah. Do you suppose them catfish ever look up?
- Piss on them.
- From up here?
Sh!
Supposed to be the best police in the world.
- They don't scare me.
- Me neither.
Let's take these horses to the home of the brave and the land of the free.
- Not today.
- What?
Not today!
Goddamn.
I'm gonna have an awful lot of explaining to do when I get home.
But I'm not gonna lie my way out of this one.
Yes, I am.
- Which one?
- I'm gonna lie my way out of it.
- Where'd she go?
- Who?
- Your ma.
- Oh...
Well, she listened very carefully to my father for about three years, weighed every word, and then she up and ran off with the first unreasonable man that she could find.
Wait a minute. Stop. This is a nice way to ride, but I know a much better way.
Where are you goin'?
Ooh!
- Well, that is clever.
- Yeah.
Would you say that this is lewd conduct?
Well, I couldn't say for sure.
My father has a library full of law books, cos he believes in the law.
He says that we haven't got any law up here yet.
What brings that to your mind?
Because in one of those law books of his, there's a whole section on lewd conduct.
- What about it?
- It's against the law.
Are you an outlaw?
I'm a jackpot rancher with a milk cow and
100 square foot of root vegetables. Why?
- Why do you have so many guns?
- Because I'm a sportsman.
Why do you have a sawed-off shotgun?
Well, because I'm a sawed-off sportsman.
Well, something has sure started in my thinking, and I don't know why we should go on if you're just gonna end up dead.
Whoa.
Can we get down here for a while and talk?
- Yeah. OK.
- You can make it?
# When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more
# And the morning breaks eternal, bright and fair
# And the chosen ones shall gather over on the other shore
# And the roll is called up yonder
I'll be there
# When the roll is called up yonder
# When the roll is called up yonder...
Now they've locked in with Jesus.
Let's do it.
- Makes me feel real safe and peaceful.
- Well, that's what Sundays are for.
For the best police in the world,
Mounties are dumber than sticks.
We just left 'em nothin'.
Ha-ha! Whoo!
Damn.
Shouldn't crawl up on people like that.
Well, I'm not the crawlin' kind.
I was just passin' by and I thought
I'd ask you a question or two.
There was a family of Logans out of Kaycee, Wyoming.
There was four brothers.
The youngest was a kid named Lonnie.
They was all pretty quick, except for Lonnie - he was a fiddle player, and...
They killed him off right quick.
Some of the ranchers had found him thievin' or something like that.
Anyway, I was wonderin'... would they be kin to ya?
No. No.
Well, I didn't think so because you don't carry a gun.
No, I never carry a gun.
I never wear a gun neither.
Oh, once in a while I carry this little darlin' around.
She's almost like a poem.
You know, it's all hand-done.
Etched, you know, scratched in silver.
Oh, she's a beauty.
Made for the president of Mexico.
I diverted it for a hundred-dollar bill.
But it doesn't shoot worth a damn.
Some damn fool came along and filed off the top of the front sight.
And you have to sort of play with it.
It isn't easy.
Have a look at the rope.
Not bad.
There's one left.
I doubt it.
You're smart.
Farmers ain't smart.
I don't know exactly where you came from or what you were doing, but I think you ought to go back to it, because you can't farm worth spit.
Unless... unless you lost your nerve.
In that case, cabbages is just what the doctor ordered.
Is your nerve gone?
Is your nerve gone?
Yah!
Easy, easy!
We're home, boys. We'll bed down soon.
How we gonna get 'em to swim across the Mighty Mo?
If you can get one or two to go, they'll all go.
Here's the breaks. Come on!
Back in the USA! What a relief.
Hey!
Slow, boys.
Mounties!
Come on. Let's get outta here.
Get down.
Let's get outta here.
Come on! Yah! Yah!
Agh!
Let's go! Let's go!
Wonder where Little Tod got himself off to.
I don't know.
I don't know where my finger is either.
Them Mounties... followed us right into the United States of America, got their horses back.
It's not even legal!
Tie that hand up and let's move. Maybe we'll meet Little Tod at the Snake's Cross.
Come on.
Come on. Go! Go!
Whoa, there.
Do you always get off your horse that way?
I'm not chasin' you.
- Who did you think was after you?
- This is the haunt of thieves and killers.
Oh, shit. Here.
This ain't the haunt of nothin' but diamondbacks and old farts like me.
- Who are ya?
- My name's Jim Ferguson.
I'm pleased to meet you.
What's your name?
Tod La Frambois.
La Frambois.
- What's your trade, Mr La Frambois?
- Trade?
Well, I been in the... farm implement business.
Now I'm lookin' to get on with the ranch.
Maybe down around Absaroka.
That'd be over that way.
I tell you what. I got a nice hare on a stick over here.
Let's go have a bite to eat.
- Well... thank you.
- Come on.
# Life is like a mountain railway
# With an engineer that's brave
# We must make this run successful
# From the cradle to the grave
# Heed the curves, the fills, the tunnels
# Never falter, never quail
Never quail.
# Keep your hand upon the throttle
# And your eye upon the rail
- Sweet song.
- Yeah.
Do you believe that life is like a mountain railroad, Mr La Frambois?
All I know, Jim, is that... life is not like anything
I ever seen before.
Yes.
It's really strange runnin' into a preacher out here, in this hellhole.
I believe that life is like a mountain railway, but not for the reasons in the song.
I think life is like a mountain railway cos you don't have no idea what sleazy son of a bitch got his hand on the throttle.
That's a real strange attitude for a preacher.
Yep.
I ain't no preacher.
What do you do?
I'm about a quarter-ass horse thief.
Anything to get some grits in my stomach.
Not doin' too good at it neither.
Otherwise I wouldn't be eatin' hare.
I'd be in Dodge City, playin' with them big asses, drinkin' champagne.
What about yourself there, Tod?
What do you do?
Well, there's really nothin' to say.
I'm a single man. Implement business.
- Where you got this implement business?
- It's in Big Sandy.
No, I mean the Shonkin Sag.
No, I mean Big Sandy. Big...
I was raised up in Big Sandy.
There ain't a teeny-weeny implement business in Big Sandy, and not in Shonkin Sag neither.
Mr Ferguson, I'm really grateful to you for your hospitality and everything, but my line of work is none of your damn business.
I'm sorry, Tod. I didn't mean to get you all riled up like that.
I'll tell you what.
Maybe one of these days, I'll get a chance to cook your supper for you.
Hah! Hooray for a free dang meal.
Good.
Thank God.
I hope you keep my business to yourself too.
Hey. You got my word.
That's good enough.
What the hell's goin' on here?
Goddamn. What the hell's the matter with you?
Something... I don't know...
Tryin' to get some sleep here.
I want you to cinch up good on the knot there.
- Yeah, I did.
- All right, now don't have fear.
This is the way my daddy taught me, now.
Easy aces, now. Come on.
Come on.
This is the part I hate.
I can't swim a lick.
- What do I do?
- Now slide off.
Slide off. Let her go.
Let the horse go. Don't hold on.
- That's it. Now we're doin' it.
- Whoo-hoo!
I got you now.
Damn!
- Hell, this is easy.
- Up on that beast now.
You're halfway to the barn now, laddie.
- Halfway.
- Yee-hah!
Come on! We've cut that son of a bitch.
We cut that goddamn thing slicker than butter.
Listen, you go on ahead now.
You go on over there and I'll secure the rope here.
- You got a good hold on that?
- Yeah.
You get goin' now, and then you pull me in case something happens to me.
Yah!
Let her go now.
I don't know about this.
That's it. Go ahead.
In you go.
Damn horse won't swim. Come on.
- Dig your heels in now.
- This isn't bad at all.
Yah!
I can't swim. Bring me in.
Now, you dirt turkey, are you gonna talk to me?
You gonna tell me somethin' now?
Listen, son, you got two choices now.
Drink this muddy son of a bitch, or tell me about Tom Logan and your goddamn rustlin'.
You... You son...
- I'm gonna give you one...
- I'm not gonna say anything.
Mr La Frambois, one.
Agh!
Adios, amigo.
That's Little Tod's horse.
Damned if it ain't.
What happened?
Did he get bucked off or what?
- I don't know.
- Cal?
- What is it?
- What the hell's goin' on?
Let's get inside.
- What's happening?
- Lee Clayton. Lee Clayton!
Come here, Sandy, old girl.
We're goin' to a picnic.
He never will close that gate.
It wasn't near as gloomy around here when we only had rustlers.
Never seen nothin' like him. Come on.
Never thought Mr Braxton would call in a man like that.
I presume you've had an enlightening trip.
Mm...
Well, what kind of trip did you have?
What did you learn?
Lower your voice. I feel an attack of gas and that could be perilous to both of us.
That's good.
What did you learn?
The one man that could have told me something didn't tell me nothing, and then he upped and drowned himself in the Missouri River.
You've got no further than we did without you.
Oh, I can track a bluebottle fly right up your nose.
And I've taken to trackin' what people are thinkin'.
Where's your wife?
What has that got to... Damn it!
I detest your impertinence.
You stay out of my private life, you lilac-smellin' son of a bitch.
You ain't the first mental wizard
I ever met, you know.
I've met ranchers, outlaws, stock detectives who thought they was mental wizards like yourself.
There was one thing I could never understand and that was...
"Why can't they hang on to their women?"
You're beginning to rave.
And you're beginning to bore me.
So you're gonna stop.
You're gonna stop spying on me and on my family.
You were never hired to do that.
I do not, and Jane does not, and the dozen dolts who work for me do not steal horses.
But somebody does, don't he?
Well, there's a sight for sore eyes.
- Cal!
- Long time, Logan.
Cal, I want you to meet a good friend of mine. Jane Braxton.
- How do?
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.
She was born and bred here, Cal, and ready for city lights.
Pretty ladies should have what they want.
- How's the ranch comin', Tom?
- You want a tour?
Sure do.
I'll see you later. Bye.
Cal, come on, I'll show you the orchard.
Come on, buddy.
This little bastard was in sorry shape before I got to it.
These trees wouldn't have turned out a peck of apples apiece.
No wonder that guy's makin' barrels in town. He wasn't running this place right.
This tree was all full of scale and blight.
These limbs I dug out of here had borers in 'em and insect eggs all over everything.
It was...
Little Tod didn't come home.
What the hell are you doin'?
What difference does it make whether blight or borers eat up this whole ranch?
Well, Cal, I just have to say it.
I'd prefer that they didn't ruin the orchard.
Poor Little Tod.
Gimme that cartridge.
That girl's old man hired Lee Clayton, didn't he?
Yeah. He did.
What about her? Where's her husband at?
She don't have a husband.
She don't need one.
She don't need one.
Boy, you're pretty far gone, ain't ya?
- It's the way it happens, isn't it, Cal?
- I wouldn't know.
Not since that dog of mine put his tongue on the butter.
Where's Lee Clayton? Is he here?
You betcha. Moved right in.
Made himself at home. Boy!
Robert Lee?
Robert Lee.
You know, the old man built this tub for the old lady, and she ran out on him.
Wasn't that you callin' me out there?
Yes, son. That was me.
There's no way you can win, you know.
What?
- There's no way you can win.
- Win?
It's kin of mine is all that calls me Robert Lee.
I'm going to bust your fat ass.
How am I to get my nourishment spending my dinner hour here with you?
You ain't gonna get no nourishment.
You're gonna dry up and blow away.
It just ain't in the cards, angel.
Can't you see that the list is as long as my arm?
You're under the headin' of what I do for a livin'.
Now step outside, because my stomach has commenced to growl.
Are you scared?
Shakin' all over.
It's almost like I don't have a prayer.
But I can't lose this appetite.
What ails me?
You're floatin' there in your confirmation dress waitin' for God to save ya.
Did it ever bother you, sittin' up there in that cabin drinkin' coffee, while that fiddler's wife was screamin' in the Sandwash?
Well, first off... I don't drink coffee.
Now can I climb out?
I'm hungry for my supper.
Where's your Creedmore at, Robert Lee?
Where's your cabbage-shootin' Mexican pistola with flowers on the handle?
Why don't you go get it?
That settles it.
I'm not that hungry and I'll stay here till someone fetches me who cares about my welfare.
- I deplore...
- Get up, you dry-gulchin' piece of slime.
A little bathe in the tub here...
Get up!
Get up!
I want to lie here and lose.
No dinner. No nothing.
Well?
My God. You ain't even there.
Did you kill him?
No, I just emptied his tub. Somebody's gonna have to do something about that.
What's become of Tom?
- Isn't he on his place?
- No, he's not.
Well, that's not what I call ranching.
I know what you're driving at.
All I can tell you is that things have been nearly as bad as they could be.
If those two men have reason to look for one another, I'm not interfering.
You find Lee Clayton and you stop him.
No.
You can't.
I won't.
I hope that you choke on that.
You don't mean that, darling.
- Vern, scat.
- You betcha.
I wouldn't have hired Lee if the rustlers hadn't killed Pete.
This has nothing to do with Pete, law, or stealing horses.
- Then what does it have to do with?
- Tom Logan.
Tom Logan.
- I never even think about him.
- You can't bear me being with him.
Now, Daddy, goddamn it.
You find Lee Clayton and you stop him!
You think I couldn't bear living here alone, don't you? Start me thinking.
No... No.
No, I won't. I won't.
Whoa, Buck.
- Oh...
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Cal's got me lookin' out for Lee Clayton.
- Come on down. Old Buck come up lame.
Gimme a hand. Goddamn it.
Easy, Buck. Come on now.
Only goddamn intelligent horse.
Easy, boy.
I had him.
You think anybody could do it?
I mean... an ordinary fella?
I don't know.
Seems like somebody oughta be able to get the job done.
Just watch it is all.
I'll tell you one thing, though.
Don't start talkin' to him.
I don't care what the plan is, as long as you get us outta here.
That's what I'd like.
Let's just pull our socks up and get out.
We're gonna hit Braxton.
We're gonna take everything he's got.
Blooded stock an' all.
- That's the least we can do.
- And maybe flush us a regulator.
I would love to include the old man.
A.44-40 in the brain would be my sentence for him.
I don't know why you don't want to go along with that.
I'd just sooner we didn't.
I wanna know on what grounds you don't wanna shoot Braxton!
We ain't gonna do it because I said we ain't gonna do it!
Am I perfectly clear on that, Cal?
Goddamn it, let's not start that stuff.
Really, Tom, it's only gonna wreck the whole job.
Cal?
Hey, Woodruff.
Braxton got you nighthawking.
Mr Logan, what you doin' out of bed at this hour?
Lookin' for a better life, Woodruff. What do you know that's new and exciting?
- Same old thing.
- What do you got in here?
Oh...
And I got the walkin' horse, but...
You're gonna take 'em.
You bet. You wanna get down now?
And reach me over that bird's head Colt you got stuck in your shirt there.
Butt first, if you please, Woodruff.
- You think you're smart, don't you?
- Well, I ain't dumb and I ain't tied up.
You just lay on that soft spot.
- You're slicker than snot on a door knob.
- Thank you, Cary.
I tell you one goddamn thing.
Old Braxton's gonna be one surprised-assed son of a bitch, ain't he?
I regret Pete Marker wasn't here to get the news, that sorry bag of shit.
We'll see him in hell, that son of a bitch.
Shut up, Si, or you'll push these horses all the way down to Kansas without us.
Let's push, boys. I feel eyes all over us.
That relay ranch is dead.
Anybody got a preferred district?
- Hellsgate for me.
- Big Hole.
Big Hole. I'll meet you there. Cal?
Dodge Pole. Shit, that's all that's left.
- We'll meet back at the old cabin. Cary?
- All right.
Remember, I wanna get $20 a head for these or we're doing this job...
I could have picked off one or two of them maybe, but we'd have lost the rest.
Supposin' you had a barn full of nasty old bats. You wanted to get rid of them.
The worst thing you could do is just get your gun and start shootin' around.
What good would it do you?
They'd leave and they'd be back by 7.30 in the morning.
If you want to get rid of a whole lot of evil bats, there's only one way.
And the way is this.
You wait till the dawn comes.
About 4.30 and you're waitin' outside by the barrels.
Then you close the door real quick and all the bats are inside.
Then while they're sleepin', the lovely little sweethearts, you have every one of the dirty little buggers at your mercy.
- That's the only way you can do it.
- That's all very informative.
But every horse I own is gone.
The only way you're going to get paid is if I get them back.
Golly.
I don't care a damn about that. Come on.
Always finish the work.
And... I don't give a damn whether or not I get paid.
And, uh... talkin' about horses, I think
I know the horse you're worrying about.
- He wears a black hat, he's two-legged...
- Shut up.
...and I think I know where he stands at stud.
Shut up! You're out of control.
You're through.
I want you off the place. Now get!
Well, it is your place, sir.
But the work is mine and I'll have the say about that.
Come on, Jess.
We know when we're not wanted.
Let's go out to the bat hunt now.
You lazy no-good bastards, get back to work or I'll fire every one of you!
They call this country Hellsgate.
When my dad came in here, it was nothing but a bunch of savage Indians... and Jesuits.
Old Thomas Jefferson said that he was a warrior so his son could be a farmer,
so his son could be a poet.
I raise cattle so my son can be a merchant, so his son can move to Newport,
Rhode Island, buy a sailboat and never see one of these bastard-assed son-of-a-bitchin' mountains again.
Who was Thomas Jefferson?
Guy back east.
I'll bet you're about done in.
You had a long day.
That's true.
Mother, you wanna show our boy the bunkhouse?
Surely. I'll bring him a blanket.
I'll see you before you start out in the morning.
Fine.
Let me thank you again for selling me those horses.
It's my pleasure.
My compliments to the artist that changed those brands.
Was it you?
I learned it from a nice boy from
Newport, Rhode Island, with no sailboat.
They hung him in a cottonwood south of the Shonkin Sag, by the neck, until dead.
- You've got five minutes.
- OK. Sh.
Wait. It would help if you got out of your drawers altogether.
- No.
- Sh.
- What good is it keepin' them on one leg?
- Why don't you shut up?
You've only got four of your minutes left.
Besides, I'm beginning to chafe.
Agh!
Hon? Honey?
Kid. Hey, kid.
Here's a buck. Go get me a whiskey and the rest is yours.
Good stuff. Go on. Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Thanks.
Hold these, junior.
I won't be but a minute, then we'll go get something to eat.
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
I ain't got but $54, mister.
But I want all three horses or nothing.
What you got to trade?
A clarinet.
All right, I'll take it.
I can't use it. It looks too tight.
Here. Let me try it on.
Put your arm in.
You can't tell till it's on.
Oh, it fits...
I don't want the goddamn thing.
Smoked meat!
Old smoked meat.
Where's Tom Logan?
I couldn't get him to come out.
God!
Too proud, huh?
I reckon.
I'd like about anything but getting burned up.
Well, you're about the last of your kind, old man.
If I was a better businessman than I am a manhunter,
I'd put you in the circus.
You know, about this time of year -
Indian summer - gettin' there... they say you can see the Star of Bethlehem, if you look real good.
I seen it once or twice. But you gotta look away and then you gotta look at it, see?
You gotta look at it just a minute, like that, see?
See what I mean?
Well, old Granny's gettin' tired now.
Cal?
Si?
Oh... Oh...
Oh, my God.
No. Kiss first.
Kiss first.
You have the lips of Salome, and the eyes of Cleopatra.
I dedicate this song to the only woman I ever loved.
I'm too shy to turn around and say it to your face, but I mean it from my heart.
I don't love you, you harlot.
I'm not even speaking to you.
Do you know that?
Come on. Would you?
That for you, and your disloyalty and your treachery.
Dear heart.
Grandma... Grandma.
Say good night to Granny.
I'll play you a tune.
Well, that's a fine thing.
You've pissed right in the middle of my love song.
God! Pissin' over my song.
Well...
You know what woke you up?
Lee, you just had your throat cut.
Where is he?
He's in there.
All the rest of the hands left a couple of days ago except for Vern.
- I'm stayin'. You betcha.
- It's all right, Vern.
I told him I was leaving last night and he... sort of came unravelled.
He's just lost himself.
Well, all I can say is he'd better leave the room, cos I'm gonna do it regardless.
Get out of the way, Vern.
You recognise this?
- You recognise it?
- No. No.
Please, don't shoot him.
What are you caterwauling about, Vern?
Get out of the way before I put one into you.
You might as well. He's all I got. No...
He's all I have. He's all I have.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Shoot me.
Shoot me. Yes, shoot me.
- Praise the Lord.
- Get out! Get that son of a bitch away.
- Vern, will you get away?
- I will. You betcha.
- I'm sorry, Tom.
- What for?
For everything.
Your friends, are they...
Yeah.
If...
What were you gonna do? Just take off?
Yes.
What'd you expect?
To see you, for one thing.
- Did you think I'd be above ground?
- Well, of course.
- Why "of course"?
- Because I just can't imagine you dead.
My God, are you gonna make me say it?
Tom!
You've just about done it, huh?
Yeah.
Well, I think I've found a buyer for the ranch.
I'm going into Absaroka now to see about it and find a place for Vern.
Well...
I'm glad.
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life tryin' to get back at somebody.
Why'd you say that?
No reason.
Well, hell, neither do I.
Where do you think you'll be... in about six months?
Well, if I was to guess,
I'd say north of the breaks.
There's the Little Rockies up there.
A lot of little valleys are supposed to have water year round.
Sounds like a real good guess.

ENHOH
Oh no!
Looks like they are at war, with their Turks.
I didn't know that the
Indians were on the warpath.
- Shepherd! Shepherd, look!
- What is it?
It's nothing.
They have their problems, we have ours.
Let's go.
THE ACTRESS, THE DOLLARS AND
THE TRANSYLVANIANS
Hello!
Leave the horses here.
Dear Sir... two rooms, two.
He says that he has no vacancies.
I understood, I'm not stupid.
A couple of slaps might change his mind.
What is he saying?
He says that Bob is not allowed, but it's nothing, Bob will find a place.
But why?
Because Bob is black.
So.........
You lot go to the market.....
And see how things are goin on.
- Buy some clothes for the lady.
- Traian, be careful.
Call me shepherd Traian,
I'm older than you.
Go!
What does he say?
It's beautiful.
Let's go now.
So...
How is it, "Shepherd Traian"?
- How do you think? It's ok.
- Alright.
He managed to understand, finally.
Otherwise, he's a good boy.
It's perfect, "Shepherd Traian".
Ion!
You should be ashamed.
Bob, close the door.
I don't say no, to giving the man a slap or two...
But not like this, shooting everywhere.
Instead try to say something nice, because we are good men from
Poplaca, who don't shoot for no reason.
Have you seen this?
You were prepared to shoot him.
Brother Traian....
I don't wanna hear!
I'm the oldest one here,
I'm the leader.
Must I lock it?
Well, dear brother...
You must know that it won't be easy for me.
- Shepherd I think that...
- You, Romi...
Mind your own business.
And take care of this girl.
She will sleep here, in the room.
Alone!
This is the rule.
We will sleep together.
Well...
I'm going to check out the town, but I think that here... it's good to be very careful.
Bob, come with me,
I want a beer.
And I don't want to drink it alone.
Dear Bob, I suggest that we go to take a look at that fair.
The last time I saw something like that was in Vienna and Peszta.
And it was so funny!
Bob likes too.
Bob...
Look at her, she's like an angel.
Hey...
I think... that they'll kill each other.
Dear Miss, don't be upset, because in the end... everything will be fixed if a person doesn't loose hope.
And please don't cry, your eyes are like two shining stars.
Have you seen what happened?
The business with the
Indians is messed up.
It's their business.
We're going to get something to eat and drink at the saloon.
It's your business.
Shepherd Traian, you're fucked up.
What is it?
What is it?
Why are you entering like this?
It's the end of the world, come and see the impossible.
Look.
It really is the end of the world.
Hear?
IS there any money left?
Bob, stay here with me.
God damn this whiskey.
It's worse than death.
Well, dear Ms. Anabella...
I came to tell you that I'm very concerned about your troubles.
I hope you don't think that I'm stupid.
I saw that the play was just fantasy.
It was not the first time for me that I was at a theater.
For I was enrolled at ........
Regiment.
So, I know what it's all about.
But those tears were real, and they really upset me.
Because nobody cries on command.
Only if he has in his soul... a hidden pain.
Bob.... translate what I've said.
Your Mom and Dad, are they alive?
Or, are you left alone on the face of the Earth.
Her father, is dead.
Then, rest in peace.
Something wrong?
Dear Anabella... are you coming for a ride?
Bob, listen carefully to me.
2 beers!
She's a good girl.
But she's unlucky. 'Til now.
Well, well.
Lots of noise outside.
You're pretty enough.
You still have some snowdrops.
Mind your own business.
Don't you worry about me.
I've been here for 8 years.
It's subtle, you're still stupid.
Oh my god!
Ion, what's that man doing here?
They called them to the city...
They promised that nothing would happen, then they killed his father.
What are we going to do?
He's wanted now.
What do you mean by:
"What are we going to do?"
Come, come, come inside.
Ion, give him that key.
Because he hasn't came here just to visit us.
He's here to ask us for help.
We need to ask questions.
So, he'll stay here as long as it's necessary.
'Till we sort everything out.
Stop, we have time.
What do you want here?
Wait a second!
Where the hell are we?
In the woods?
In the desert?
Ion, don't lock it.
I have something to do.
And you, take care of everything.
- Don't forget the Indian.
- Ok, ok, go,
There are some beautiful places around here.
But not like in Poplaca.
Unfortunately the lands in Poplaca belong to the nobles, not to ordinary people.
But it's not a bad thing.
There will come a time when the land will belong to the people.
It's not the end of the world yet.
And you must know, Anabella... that I'll take care of you, like I take care of a fragile Easter Egg.
And you'll have no worries...
As long as I have these hands.
And you're talent won't be lost.
I already see all the people... that are watching your shows.
And you'll say...
DESTEAPTA-TE ROMANE ( AWAKE, ROMANIANS )!
What's with these people?
What does he want?
No!
I'll take care of this.
Good night Anabella, good night.
How long are we staying here?
Dear brother, we'll not stay for much longer.
I took care of you until now.
Now, it's my time.
You see,
I'm still young.
And it will be bad if I don't live my life.
Do not embarrass yourself.
- You know what those actresses are?
- Johnny!
Or whatever the hell they call you around here.
If you say one more word...
I'll leave you with no teeth.
Romi, my son.
It's hard, isn't it?
Money isn't easy to earn.
Blacksmith!
Give him some slaps, if he doesn't do his work!
Yeah, yeah.
Because...
Hey, leave her alone!
I see that the Americans are eating with their hats on their head.
Not like this, my dears.
How's it possible to eat like this?
We stay at the table, and he stays there, like a dog.
Maybe, that's the tradition around these parts.
Now, I like it.
Good appetite.
Ion... where's Romi?
What is he doing, every evening he's late.
He's missing my slaps.
He's a man now.
A man.
Don't talk, I was outside.
[shitty song]
Brother, for God's sake, don't embarrass yourself.
You spend all our money on this woman.
Since when was it our money?
Say something, you idiot!
She's leaving.
Who's leaving?
The actress, the theater.
The circus.
You see?
And what's with that?
Translate.
Farewell.
Shepherd, if we're talking about translation...
How did you manage to understand her?
Shitface Mucho.
Don't talk to me like that.
Hey!
You forget about respect?
Romi.
You must think that
I'm very stupid.
And I wanted to take you to a show.
To learn something new.
But, here's some money... go get a beer.
This is for you.
Bob, you'll go with them.
It's enough.
Bob knows.
Bob sad.
This, for good luck.
Be careful.
My dears...
I'm very happy, because I can invite you to the wedding, and bring all of your families.
I can't believe my eyes.
It's the same tradition for the Americans too.
When they marry, first they visit the parents.
Well, I've seeen a lot of men like you in my life.
Traian!
I think you're finished.
Come here.
Not now.
Alright.
C'mon.
God will punish you, BITCH.
You broke my heart.
C'mon.
Look, our man is coming.
If we keep going like this, it will take us a long time to reach Poplaca.
- Oh, no!
- [Outlaw] Hell.
Goddamnit.
- [Outlaw] Come on, boy.
- Come on, get on your horse!
- Well, I can't find him!
- What do you mean you can't find him?
How can you lose anything as big as a horse?
- Because you're sitting on him, you son of a bitch.
Climb down off my horse before I blow your goddamn head off!
- Son of a bitch.
Bastards!
- Damn it, I'm hit.
- I love you.
- Ow!
- We stopping here, Em?
- No, we ain't stopping here, Em.
We're going to keep right on going till we find us a nice place to starve, you idiot.
- My leg's killing me.
- Well I sure hope bleeding is good for it, Frank,
'cause you really struck blood there.
- Shut your ass.
- Why don't you shut it for me?
- Rufus!
Me and Frank will steal some fresh horses.
You cover us.
- Let's not kill nobody we don't have to.
- Says who?
- Says me!
Now, get!
- Says you.
- Frank, come on.
Ain't the best-looking horseflesh we ever stole.
- You looking for somethin'?
I'm Jim Caulder, station man here.
- Well, howdy, Jim Caulder, station man here.
- Pine Bluff's just beyond.
No more than a mile.
- We ain't goin' to Pine Bluff.
- You're welcome to water your horses and move on.
- Did I get him?
- Ain't no part of him you didn't!
- Well, it's self-defense.
- Go and find us something to eat.
- And cook it.
- That's woman's work.
- Do as I tell you!
- Oh, goddamn!
Cook.
You're always cutting off my cojones.
Yeah, I'll bake you a pie.
A road apple pie.
Look what we got for supper.
Frank! Emmett!
- [Emmett] Come on.
- You got any whiskey, lady?
Whiskey?
Hey!
- [Woman] Oh! Get out!
- You got too many things on.
Turn to me.
That's the way I like it.
- No!
No!
No!
- [Rufus] Hey!
- [Woman] No! Aah!
- [Rufus] I'm next, I'm next!
Emmett.
I want her one time!
Oh, God.
Go, Frank.
Whoo-wee!
- The well.
Me and my horses need water.
Give me that.
You wasn't, by any chance, married to a no-good bastard with a price on his head, were ya?
- You're a bounty hunter.
- I am.
- You kill men for money.
- You know a better reason?
- Sure as hell do.
- Your man run off with a painted lady?
- I wish he had.
The way you shoot that gun, can you teach me?
- [Man] What for, you wanna kill somebody?
- Yes.
- Horse shit.
You couldn't go off and leave a man on the cold ground last night.
- I'll learn.
- You'll forget is what you'll do.
Whatever it is that happened to you, you'll forget it.
- The hell I will.
- I don't know what your troubles are, lady, and I don't give a damn.
But whatever it is…
You can't solve it with a six-shooter.
- In other words, you won't help me.
- Yeah, that's it.
- I'll make it worth your while.
- I don't see no pockets in that blanket.
- I wasn't talking about money.
- Well, I'll be damned.
You do want somebody killed bad, don't you?
If I was to teach you the gun, you'd then go out and get your ass blowed off.
- It's my ass.
- Shame to get it shot full of holes.
It is as pretty a one as I ever laid eyes on.
- If you're lucky, you'll lay more than that.
- I never gamble if I don't have to.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That you're a terrible liar, lady.
If I was to touch you, you'd take that Winchester to my head again, and you know it.
The answer's no.
Flat no.
No.
No.
- Gone!
- How many was they?
- Three.
- And your husband?
- Dead. They killed him.
- My good shirt.
- Damn you, Rufus.
- Got you to thank, you pebble-brain.
My leg heals, I'm going to kick your ass clean out of your throat.
- Always two against one.
You'd lay off fast enough if Pop was still alive.
- He still would be if you hadn't shot him.
- How many times I have to tell you?
I was cleaning my gun!
Why, there ain't a night that goes by that I don't think of Pop's face.
- You mean what was left of it.
Em, you think them soldiers gonna follow us?
- I know they will.
There they are.
- Let's bushwhack the bastards.
- Like hell.
Let's get out of here!
- Here.
Put them on.
You got about as much on underneath that blanket as my horse.
My name's Price.
Thomas Luther Price.
- Mine's Mrs.,
Mine's Hannie Caulder.
- [Thomas] All right then, let's get going,
Hannie Caulder.
- Where to?
- Mexico.
There's a gun maker there.
- Gun maker?
- I can't very well teach you to shoot without one, can I?
You don't mind riding double with a dead man.
- I don't mind.
- Get you some proper britches and boots.
We got a lot of hard riding ahead of us.
I'll be in the saloon if you want me.
- What'll I do with these pants I've got on?
- Wash 'em.
- Sorry we didn't have your size.
Take a bath with them on, and they'll shrink to you.
Then you'll know they'll fit.
Just don't take 'em off till you're sure they're dry.
- The way you describe them three, you could be talking about almost anyone in this town.
- They're brothers.
One's called Rufus.
- The Clemmons.
They was through here last week.
Cut right on out, though.
- You know where they went?
- The stink of them three got here two days ahead of them.
It ain't gone yet.
- Thank you, sheriff.
- Anytime.
Anytime at all.
- If you weren't the sheriff, I'd call one.
- Your bottom's wet.
- So's your chin.
- God, that guy's built.
- Call.
- Here's your pants, Thomas.
- Thomas?
Thomas Luther Price.
- That's right.
Hannie.
- Another one?
- He made the choice.
Harrington, Samuel.
Dead or alive.
$750. Union Pacific.
- (chuckles) That's fair money for a minute's work.
That is, if you can prove who he is.
- You might know him.
I understand he's been in your town over a month.
You might even have brought him in yourself had you only known.
My name is Price, by the way.
Tom Price.
I'm sorry, Mr. Price.
I had no idea, I--
- You, uh, got the money?
- It's a wonderful job you're doing, sir, bringing in dead scum like this.
I only wish I was the same…
As you, I mean.
Apologies to you, ma'am.
- For what?
- He was afraid I'd catch cold from my wet pants.
- That's right, Mr. Price.
- For the funeral.
That.
I'll be back this way to see the grave.
- Okay. It'll be there.
It'll be there.
- Yeah.
Let's go to Mexico.
- Damn, who's down there, Custer?
- Let me get 'em.
- Get down there!
You wanna get your head blowed off?
- How'd we know the difference?
- [Rufus] Listen, I am fed up with all of your goddamn--
- Get down!
Get down!
I got a plan.
- What are we gonna do, starve them out?
- That is a good idea.
- Shut up!
We're moving out.
- That's the plan?
- That's right.
- What do we do after we move out?
- We just keep moving.
It's called staying alive.
Now, come on. Let's get.
- Name's Bailey.
Nobody knows why he settled in Mexico.
First set up shop in New Orleans.
When the war come, he switched over to making guns for the Confederate Army.
Course when the North took the town in '63, he had to make himself scarce.
The Yankees give you a bad time unless you was Abe Lincoln or a whore.
And a Rebel gunsmith woulda got his head handed to him.
- Bailey make that gun for you?
- No, I got this off a feller who had no other use for it.
But he's made so many new pieces.
He's rebuilt the gun twice.
Sure be a lot handier if he lived somewhere near civilization, but he's got a Mexican wife and more young ones than you can count on your fingers.
Not a bad life, I guess.
Home and kids.
A man ought to leave something else behind him, besides headstones.
So should a woman.
- Thomas.
Sure is good to see you.
- You, too, compadre.
This is Hannie Caulder.
- Welcome to Mexico, Miss Caulder.
- Missus.
- Welcome to Mexico, Mrs. Caulder.
You finally manage to split the barrel of that old Adams?
- No, she's still true,
I just come by to see if you got any more young ones.
- Two.
Nights are cold down here.
Come on in the house.
- [Emmett] Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn!
- [Frank] Somethin' wrong, Em?
- Wrong!?
- Hell, yes, there is.
- Shut the hell up, Rufus!
I'll tell you what the hell's wrong.
We pulled four jobs in two weeks, and we're stony-ass broke!
Starving!
- Well, we still got some coffee.
Three horses we can eat.
- You touch one hair of my animal--
- [Frank] I wouldn't touch nothin' that's been between your legs.
- Well, what about the little gal down in Sonora Town?
- You didn't jump her bones, and you know it.
- Did so. (chuckles)
Didn't I, Em?
- [Emmett] How the hell would I know?
- You remember that night that I come in all smelling like a lily.
- Hell, that don't prove nothin'.
- Are you calling me a liar?
Em, he's calling me a liar!
- Well, ya are!
- You name one time I didn't tell the truth.
- When you said there was no shotgun guard on that stagecoach that we tried to rob, that's when!
- Then you got us all shot.
- Yeah!
- Well, that was a mistake, not a lie!
Anyway, I never said that I was perfect.
All I have said--
- Oh, shut the hell up, Rufus.
I'm trying to think.
- [Rufus] With what?
- [Emmett] You son of a--
- It's a joke, Em.
You lost your damn sense of humor.
- I'm gonna lose me a baby brother if that son of a bitch don't close his mouth and keep it closed!
Frank.
- Yeah?
- Where can we steal us some dynamite?
- We gonna blow up the little bastard?
- No, we ain't gonna blow up that little bastard.
We're gonna rob us another bank.
Remember when he was talking about that, what place you say?
- Sonora Town.
- Sonora Town.
Reminded me of a fella.
- Fine-looking woman.
- [Thomas] She wants to be a man.
- [Bailey] She'll never make it.
- No, not likely.
- For which let us thank God.
May I ask why?
- Long story.
- And none of my business.
Well, now, uh, as to this gun of hers, it'll have to be light, of course.
That gives us a few problems.
It always does.
The lighter the piece, the thinner the steel.
That's where the weaknesses come.
Still, there are one or two tricks we can pull.
Thomas?
It's gonna be a cold night.
- It sure as hell is.
- Here, take this.
Take it in both hands.
Arms length, like so.
Hold it out, a little further out.
With that hand.
Now hold it up like so, shoulder high, and wind it up one-half turn at a time.
Good.
Now, let it out slow and easy.
Don't let it slip through your fingers.
All the way to the bottom, same way you wound it up.
Go ahead.
Keep it up. Keep it up.
Good.
There, you did that very well.
You're gonna do this morning and night until you can do it 30 times.
- Then I'll be ready?
- Then we'll get ya bigger rock.
He's packed about three times as much powder in the barrel as you'll ever use.
If it doesn't blow up in his face, it should last you.
- Who is that?
Looks like a preacher.
- He's not.
- New chamber.
Two weeks.
Maybe one.
The reason I take such pains with the outside of a gun is because I've always thought death very unattractive.
Mean, rotten things.
No getting back at it.
Least I can do is add a bit of style.
- Why the two triggers?
- Just a bit of Bailey magic.
Saves using your thumb to cock the hammer.
Use your middle finger to pull the lower trigger.
The hammer goes back.
Now pull the other.
- Don't ever pull that trigger unless you're aiming at something, even if it's empty.
That's your first lesson in firing a gun.
Come on.
We'll work from back of here.
All the time, there's no sense in getting up close yet…
Till you're fast.
Now…
Draw the weapon out of the holster slowly and carefully.
No.
Slow and careful.
First comes right, then comes fast.
- Okay. (clears throat)
- Raise it to arm's length.
Sight down the barrel with your right eye.
Keep both eyes open, that's important,
I'll tell you why later.
Squeeze the trigger.
Don't pull it.
Now, then, just like an army mule, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's a .45 caliber.
.45 caliber.
That'll lift a man clean off his feet from here.
- But I didn't even touch it.
- You hit the ground, front.
Slightly to the right.
Not bad.
Try it again.
This time, turn a little more sideways.
You're a target, too, you know.
Go ahead.
Again.
Again.
Again.
Again.
But judging distance is not the most important thing, but damn near it.
At sunset, a man'll cast a long shadow and give you the idea that there's a great distance between you, there may not be.
At noon, there's no shadow, the sun is directly overhead.
You'll feel you can reach out and touch him.
If you're too close to a man, you see too much of him.
You can watch him sweat, wet his mouth, blink.
While your eyes are taking all that in, he can kill ya.
Back off.
See everything…
And nothing.
And hit him right here.
Right there.
And after you fire, move.
Go ahead.
Move when you've fired.
He's shooting at you, too.
Outside of judging distance, you gotta judge human nature.
Now…
There's a feller over here on your left looking mean, standing tall in the sun, his thumbs hookin' his gun belt, legs wide apart, hat tipped back.
Over on your right, there's a fella whose face you can't see.
His hat's down over his eyes, he's turned away from you, looks like he doesn't even notice you.
Now you gotta kill both of 'em.
It would behoove you to kill the fastest one first.
Hop to it.
Here.
Right here.
Let's keep working.
- Doesn't look like a man who makes his way killing, does he?
- [Thomas] (laughs) Come on, now.
Now.
- Bailey?
Them customers?
- I could do without their business.
- Winchester.
- Bailey.
- [Thomas] Again, Hannie!
Again, Hannie!
- [Man] We go!
- [Emmett] Rufus, get down!
The safe's gonna blow!
- I'll be through in a minute.
Get down, ya ninny!
- I said I'll--
- You blew up the money!
You dummy!
You dummy!
Come on, Rufus!
- But I'm--
- [Emmett] Kee-rist!
- Thanks, Em.
- Well, the bartender said he's seen them, all right.
In congress yesterday, if they're headed this way, that could put 'em here by this afternoon.
I'll say it one more time: give it up, Hannie.
- [Hannie] I can't.
- You mean you won't.
- I mean I can't.
They're gonna get what they deserve.
- Well, you're not.
Win or lose, you lose.
You'll not be the same person.
- I hope to hell I'm not.
- Well, it's your life, lady.
- What kind of life?
When every man I look at is thinking the same--
- I'm looking at you.
- What do you see?
- The woman I staked out of pure, damn meanness.
I wish to God I'd left you there.
I ought to now.
- Go ahead.
I don't need you anymore.
- You just used me, is that it?
- That's it.
- Like I said…
You're a terrible liar, Hannie.
- What do you mean you don't have any money?
What they hell'd you do with your share the last job we pulled?
- What share?
Nothing don't go very far.
- Uh, Frank is right, Emmett.
Uh, women cost money.
- What the hell would you do with a woman?
You got less in your pants than you got in your head.
- Oh, shut up!
Em, make him shut up.
- Shut up!
- And two makes four!
- You sure smell good, Frank.
Don't turn around.
Now if you can manage to do as you're told, your life will be a lot easier.
And a whole lot longer.
Undo your gun belt.
And let her hit the ground.
Kick it away and turn around here.
Frank Clemmons, isn't it?
- If that's what it says there.
- Frank, there's a hundred dollars on your head.
That's what I call inflation.
The sheriff's office is across the square.
Let's see if we can get there together.
- Thomas.
Thomas?
- Hannie, get me out of here.
- You were right about me.
I'm a rotten liar.
- Rotten with a gun, too.
- Now who's lying?
- They'll kill you, Hannie.
- [Hannie] They'll try.
- Promise?
Promise me you won't…
Hannie.
I'll be a son of a bitch.
- Yes, ma'am?
- The Clemmons brothers, you know where they are?
- Don't know about the others, Frank's in Room 22.
- That'll do for a start.
- Hey, I don't remember hiring you.
- You didn't.
I'm looking for someone.
- Well, if he's up there, he's not worth finding.
- He's worth finding.
- [Blonde Lady] Starting early, Herman?
- Finishing late, madam.
- [Blonde Lady] We'll be outside taking the sun.
- Yes, ma'am.
- [Woman] Oh!
- Get up!
Strap it on.
- Can I put my pants on?
- You're not gonna need 'em for long.
- What the hell is this all about?
- I'm gonna kill ya.
- You mean you're gonna try.
- Anytime you're ready.
- [Thomas] Again, Hannie.
Again, Hannie. Again, Hannie.
Again!
- Oh!
- Looks like your sign fell down.
- There you are, $100 even.
Damn it, woman.
You didn't have to cut him in half, did you?
- Both halves match, don't they?
Here.
For the funeral.
- That's a, that's a very unusual gesture.
- I learned it from a very unusual man.
I expect all of it to go for the funeral.
- I don't know is I like what you're implying, ma'am.
- You don't have to like it, just remember it.
- I'd sure hate to be you when the other Clemmons brothers find out about this.
- I wouldn't wanna be you anytime.
- I stole a Bible, Em.
Do you want to read over Frank?
- You know damn right well I can't read.
To hell with him anyway.
- You shouldn't have done that, Em.
You're gonna gettin'
God mad at us and he's--
- Shut your damn mouth!
- Well, I want to say something over Frank!
- Well, say it and get it the hell over with!
- All right!
Frank…
You're dead.
God…
Damn if I don't miss you already, you miserable bastard!
- Well, instead of bawling, you ought to be lookin' for the bitch that done it!
- I have.
Hell, yes, I have, just like a goddamn, excuse me, God, bloodhound, I been looking.
Em, she's trying to break up our family.
- Now how in the hell did ya guess that?
- We gotta kill her ass.
I'll hunt her down, and we'll kill her ass.
- What are they doing over there?
- Beats the hell out of me.
- Well, get the hell over and find out.
- Thanks.
They said they're digging two more holes over there.
They told them.
- Who told them?
- Some woman in town.
- Oh, she did, huh?
You tell them to dig just one,
'cause that's all she's gonna need.
- She?
- She!
'Cause we're gonna kill her ass.
- Let's have about a quart of that.
- Hmm, well, it doesn't exactly come as whiskey, ma'am.
However, we do have a large-sized bottle.
- Just drop the damn bottle.
- [Hannie] Hello, Rufus.
- I hear you got real smart since we saw you last.
- Funny, I didn't hear the same thing about you.
- That's a good old time we had back at your place, wasn't it? (chuckles)
- Depends on which side of the good old time you were on.
- Reason I didn't recognize you right off,
I didn't know you with your clothes on. (laughs)
You know, Emmett and me's real sore about what you did to Frank.
He was our brother, you know, and brothers don't grow on no goddamn trees, so I'll tell you what we're gonna do now.
You and me and Em is going to have a little party for old times' sake, and then we're gonna separate your head from the rest of ya.
Well, come on, sugar.
Move your ass.
I said move your--
- For the funeral.
- Well, there's enough there for two.
- That's right.
- You know, you'd be doing me a big favor, Ms. Caulder, if you'd just get yourself right the hell out of my town before some innocent people get caught in your crossfire.
- I wonder you didn't say the same thing to the Clemmons?
- They weren't bothering nobody.
They were just riding around being wanted.
You're shooting the hell out of the place.
- I'll tell you what, sheriff.
You tell the last of the Clemmons that Hannie Caulder will be waiting for him out at the old prison.
I'll settle my business and not offend you any further.
- You're a hard woman, Hannie Caulder.
- Like the man said,
"There aren't any hard women, only soft men."
- That bitch!
Who the hell does she think she is treating my family to a funeral?
God, where the hell is she?
Goddamnit! Where is she?
- She's at the old prison.
She said she'd be waitin'.
- Oh, she is, huh?
- You make damn sure it's self-defense!
- [Thomas] When a man's close to you, you see too much of him.
You can see him sweat, lick his lips, blink his eyes.
Watch his hands.
Watch his eyes.
Remember, you're a target too.
Pick your spot.
Ready, Hannie?
Get ready.
Now!
Again, Hannie! Again!
Win or lose, you lose, Hannie Caulder.

Oh, Wakantanka,
Great Spirit of the Sun, source of all life, created in violence, pleasure and pain, which then takes life to sustain life, in the eternal cycle of life and death - l stand humble and obedient before you.
Make me worthy!
How many is that?
- Six, your Lordship.
- Maddock...?
- l'm sorry.
- John. Address me as John.
Yessir. lt won't happen again.
You slip at least once a day. How many weeks have l been telling you?
Yes, sir, John.
- Six, did you say?
- ln a row. That's good shooting, John.
- Thank you, Maddock.
- You may address me as Joe.
- Joe... What did you say that was?
- Prairie chicken.
Grouse.
Grouse. At home in England, l'd be shooting grouse. lt occurs to me, l've travelled halfway around the world at great expense, simply to kill a different kind of bird.
What's wrong with that, if you ain't got nothing better to do? l ain't Joe.
For five years l ain't got nothing better to do.
You must have picked up a lot of beans somewhere.
Not only beans, Joe, but family titles, family property, family position...
All picked up. All inherited.
Everything l ever wanted in life l've bought. lncluding you three. ln England l looked up to God and royalty and down upon everybody else.
What you been doin' for five years?
Looking, Joe. Just looking. ln 1 820 l committed the unpardonable sin of resigning my commission in the Guards. lt wasn't an earned commission. ln my family, it came with birth.
So here l am. Shooting birds.
Your Northwest Territory...it is beautiful.
Hey, Ed. l dumped the water out of that damned tub into his tent. All over his tent.
And look what l found.
- Rum. That spell rum, don't it?
- Yeah.
R - U - M.
Hey, Ed... Draw!
- Still drunk as coots.
- l'll have to talk to those two. ln a pinch, l've know them to drink coal oil.
Beat the drums and sound the brass, here come one big horse's ass.
- What were you two firing at?
- Nothing in particular.
That was an accident.
Even at this range, l'm inclined to believe you.
How long would it take to go to St Louis?
- A month, if that wagon holds up.
- We'll start in the morning. lf the wagon breaks down, abandon it and the team.
We'll travel by riding horses if necessary.
- ls them orders, John?
- Those are orders, Maddock.
Well, you've boozed us out of another job.
We ain't shutting down camp.
He guaranteed us four months wages.
You'll get your money.
The dude ain't cheap.
Yeah, and if he's short, his family can sell the castle. l've never seen such a fella.
He won't even chew tobacco.
That water's powerful cold, your Lordship.
Thank you, Maddock. l can assure you l've been bred to get used to it.
This ain't gonna be no bath.
He's going ice-skating.
- Listen, you rum-heads, that's enough.
- We was just warning him.
- Something must have spooked him.
- No, he's seen Morgan going by.
Oh, my God!
Christ! l've had enough.
You bunch of bloody bastards. l'm not a horse. l'm not an animal.
Wee-cha-shad, or whatever the bloody hell the name is.
Man! Man! l am a man!
American, eh?
American? Don't be absurd.
Anglais.
Me speak Anglais. Good Anglais.
Well, when you address me, would you kindly speak it?
Yes. l will speak it.
You lucky Chief like angry.
You yell. Make strong.
Lucky not kill. Yes, very lucky. l can hardly believe my good fortune.
- Who the blazes are you?
- Batise.
Prisoner. Five years.
Five!
You speak French in a most peculiar way. You're not French.
Sacrebleu, non. Papa Français.
Blue eyes, see.
Mother flat-head lndian. Pure. See.
Family all killed.
These lndians...these Sioux. l can well believe it.
Did you never try to escape?
Yes.
Cut leg. Oh, yes.
Zip! lf l try go again, zip-zip other leg.
After...crawl. Crawl.
But now me very clever fellow.
Play crazy, see? lndian don't kill crazy man.
Crazy man no hunt, no work.
Got spirit. Wakantanka.
- Good luck for village.
- So you gave up.
Me give up nothing. Nothing!
Me very clever fellow. But you...
...the great, important English man!
Yes, you go, yes.
Like fox - dodge hounds.
And you know what happens?
Mean bad lndians out there -
Shoshone, Blackfoot, Cherokee.
Cut off everything. Zip. Zip. Zip!
But you no man anymore anyhow.
You work horse for old woman.
Buffalo Cow Head.
Maybe she zip anyway.
Stallion no good for work horse.
Everybody be happy, except you...maybe. lt's rancid fat.
Don't you have any...dried meat?
Batise.
What's going on?
Black Eagle come for Yellow Hand sister. l thought she was one of his wives.
No, no. That one Running Deer.
She is sister.
Other one is wife, Thorn Rose.
Now, Black Eagle buy sister.
- Buy her?
- Yes. Marriage. lndian way.
Must buy wife.
Very important for Black Eagle.
He only chief number two. lf she have him, he be Yellow Hand brother.
Big trouble. Yellow Hand say no.
Work hard, eh? Water?
Yes... Now that the son is dead, she has no other man.
Nobody protect her. Nobody care.
Cut off finger. Scavenge.
Come winter...she die.
Like you. One time big, grand English.
Now horse.
Stop that idiotic giggling, you bloody fool, and listen to me. l've had enough of your nonsense.
Play your fool to them but not to me. l'm going to get out with your help.
And why l do this?
Because you want to get out, that's why.
These other lndians that you spoke of, we'll need a war party to get through them. l don't suppose these Sioux have any guns?
What they know about guns?
Never see guns.
Must fight close. More brave to touch enemy. They count coup.
You look? You like? l have a big idea - you marry Running Deer.
Then maybe Yellow Hand give you war party.
All that for you.
Grand white gentleman.
She say no to Black Eagle and give herself away to Horse.
Hey, but you got mane!
Not even old squaw kiss hair on face. l have a lot to learn, Batise... and you are going to teach me.
Give them to your mother.
For her, with my compliments. l didn't think that giving flowers was so humorous. l'm...l'm sorry.
Me make love to her? Good God, no!
What is this about her shoe?
What is she trying to tell me?
She say she have no hole in her moccasin.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- lt mean... lt mean she virgin.
- l have no reason to doubt it.
Virgin take any husband she want... but not you, Anglais.
Get away, you horrible old hag!
Shoshone!
They say you kill two Shoshone. ls true?
- And l took these horses!
- And scalps!
- Big chance...big chance.
- l can't hear you.
Horses! Scalps!
- Wife! Now, wife. Then warrior.
- Then soon...Chief!
The wife sounds grand right now.
Let's get straight to her.
And then war party. And then we go!
We go!
We go! We go!
No, no. Do not look mother in face.
Taboo. Or you be cinksi.
- Cinksi?
- Son. You be her son till she die.
Oh, that suits me perfectly.
Horse... Horses!
- Does that mean we're married?
- Not yet.
- What the hell's going on now?
- Say no scars...no vows.
- Scars? Vows?
- Yes, scars. And ''Vow to Sun''.
He say you make Vow to Sun.
Then vow you brother.
But l just bought her. l just bought her, didn't l?
What the hell did l do?
Marriage is good, but must be made sacred first.
Sun Vow. lf no pain, nothing good is born.
Even seed burst to make grass.
Now make vow for courage. l vow to prove my courage, to withstand all tests of pain.
You stand in sun all day, all night...
...until sun come again.
Then suffer much pain.
God watch you now.
Wakantanka watch.
Now you ready for Sun Vow in tepee Wakan - holy lodge.
Hope for courage.
Pray Wakantanka let you live.
- l will live, Batise.
- Yes. And after, we get war party.
And England we go.
England...
Wherever you go, l serve you. l serve you well?
Oui, Batise.
You have served me well.
- When do l kiss the bride?
- You prove you man in Sun Vow, and then she kiss.
She kiss plenty... in white tepee women make for you.
That one?
- She must make pure in sweat bath.
- Sweat bath?
Yes. lndian way.
She sweat, sing, pray, make pure.
Medicine Man pray to Wakantanka that no bad things come for you.
And then you have peace... and love.
Chief want me too. Need my tongue.
He speak about Shoshone.
Counted coup scalps. Big medicine.
Must show god you brave.
Must prove courage.
Now you say why you should be permitted to make Sun Vow.
Yellow Hand... when you first brought me here, you said l was a horse. An animal.
And to me you were...
All of you were mean, vicious, ignorant, superstitious,
- ugly, benighted savages.
- No, no!
Repeat it. Repeat it!
Repeat it...accurately!
To me, you are no different from men all over the world.
When your stomachs are full and you sleep the long night, you know you must hunt again for food.
And when you fight your enemies and their arrows pierce your skins, you bleed like all men.
But it seems to me that you only live to hunt your buffalo...
...to fight the Shoshone...
...and to have your women. l know you would say to me,
''What else is there?''
Yellow Hand say your word is good, but Medicine Man say word not good.
Now, tell them this: one day, l will be a chief.
One day l will be a chief!
Say what proof you brave?
Suffer pain, yes! Give up now! Out!
He said because you white, you weak.
You give up.
Shame before Wakantanka.
Medicine bag. Bones. Beads.
Good luck things. Great honour.
Jesus! l am Tatankaska.
Spirit animal. Buffalo White.
Speak the truth in humility to all people.
Only then can you be a true man and free of your chains. l want you. My hunger is real.
But freedom is what you mean to me.
When the chance comes, l shall go. l know. l know.
- Grouse...
- What did you say?
Grouse. lt's a small bird, Batise. l used to shoot it in England... a long time ago.
Batise! What's the matter with Yellow Hand?
Yellow Hand take bearskin belt.
He swear to Wakantanka never to retreat in battle.
He now want brave death to save his honour, because Black Eagle take Thorn Rose.
He was her first man. lndian law.
That means Black Eagle can take Yellow Hand's woman... when he wants her. lf Yellow Hand complains, he is weak.
Hey, Anglais... This may be good.
He die - you be made chief quicker.
Get war party. And we go.
Five years you've lived here and you've learned nothing about these people!
All his death is to you, is a means of escape.
Take her away from this.
Take her away from this!
You're making it very, very difficult for me, Little Freedom.
Very, very difficult.
Free... Free... Freedom?
Freedom.
You are Little Freedom.
Mother.
Little Freedom, now is the truth.
You are part of me.
When l go, you go.
Forever!
Dakota Lake, the mountains...
Peace River, south. Adirondack.
Medicine Man say buffalo go after winter.
Village move.
This place bad medicine now.
Move west. Away from home.
You'd better finish that map, Batise.
He say something is wrong.
Go and get your weapons.
Get the weapons.
Shoshone Chief take bear belt.
Get everyone to the Ceremonial Lodge.
And get them bows and arrows!
Line them up there, face the Shoshone.
Form two lines.
One in front and one back here.
First line to their knees.
Second line remain standing.
The first line fire only.
Fire!
Now we go. Anywhere.
Little Freedom.
John!
Cinksi!
Oh, my God. You've got nobody left to provide for you.
You'll give everything you have away.
You'll scavenge for offal.
With winter coming, you won't last a month.
Son. l will be your son.
Cinksi.
Goodbye, Little Freedom.
Sorry, old-timer...
... but you're only part poison and I'm hungry for meat.
Getting a little thirsty too.
Bowen, go easy.
You peckerwoods just raised hell with our supper.
Find any water? l appreciate humor, boys...
... but I'm beginning to think you're cutting it a mite thin.
What else we got to do?
What did you find?
Ten thousand gallons of sand, that's what we found.
We had you shaking, didn't we, Cable?
Hold him, boy. Get over there. lt's just like you said, Hogue.
There's water enough for two, but not for three.
You damn fool. You had us.
You just wouldn't pull the trigger.
- Because you're yellow.
- Yeah, he's yellow. Just plain yellow.
Hell, you're yellow, Hogue. Cable's yellow.
Old Cable's yellow.
Old Cable is white. Old Cable's dying.
But that's all right.
Taggart and Bowen as slick as you please took all the water and left for the trees.
Hey, fellas. Leave me a little.
- Please.
- It's all yours, Cable.
Fifty thousand gallons of sand.
- We've got your water, Cable.
- Yellow!
Call me yellow.
Leave me to dry and blow away.
Sing a song about it!
Laugh at old Cable Hogue?
I'll get out.
Don't you worry none about that!
You just...
... worry about when I get out. l'll find you, Taggart.
You, Bowen, you mealy-mouthed little pimp.
You never could tell gold-shine from lizard shit, and there's a big difference.
A big difference! l'll live to spit on your graves!
Old Cable's yellow.
We got your water.
Ain't had no water since yesterday, Lord.
Getting a little thirsty.
Just thought l'd mention it. Amen.
Yesterday, l told you l was thirsty...
... and I thought you might turn up some water.
Now, if l sinned, you just send me a drop or two...
... and I won't do it no more,...
... whatever in the hell it was I did. l mean that, Lord.
Four days without water. You don't think l've put in my suffering time...
... you ought to try going dry for a spell.
Listen to me. lf l don't get some soon, l ain't gonna have no chance to repent.
Careful, now. You're about to get my dander up.
Lord...
... you call it. l'm just plain done in.
Amen.
Found it.
Told you l was gonna live.
This is Cable Hogue talking. Me.
I did it. l found it. Me.
Wagons.
Stagecoaches.
Buckboards.
With kids and mamas.
People.
Going somewhere on a road.
And l'm on it.
Me and my water hole. l whipped them bastards.
Now all l gotta do is wait.
Get out of there, boy.
Get with it. Hop on.
Hey, wait a minute, fellas.
Please. ls something the matter? Why are we stopping? Are we in trouble?
He is, we ain't.
- Nice evening, fellas.
- You're a long way from home.
- I'm halfway to hell and looking for help.
- You got it, pilgrim.
You've fallen among good hands.
The Gospel says "Do unto others...
- You want a ride in?
- He can ride inside with us.
- Matthew, chapter 2, verse 3.
- Daniel, are you sure? l've told you never to question my judgment.
As l hear, l judge, and my judgment is just.
- John, chapter 5, verse 30.
- I've never questioned your judgment. ln the 26 years of our marriage, blessed by a devotion to the Lord...
... I have never questioned your judgment. But I am now. lt seems ridiculous to sit in the middle of the desert, watching men drink.
We're near halfway in.
- How about 3,00 USD?
- Nope. lf sugar were 2 cents a barrel...
... I couldn't afford a pinch of salt or an egg to put it on.
- I was robbed about five days back.
- Robbed?
- "Robbery" did you say?
- They nailed me on the flats.
- They took everything I had.
- Mister, you're damn lucky to be alive.
- Your language is disgusting. Both of you.
- Hell, we know that.
Well! More profanity.
Shoot, partner, crawl on up. You can ride for nothing.
- What do you expect me to do?
- I expect you to take action.
We should leave. Will you please instruct the driver?
- No, thanks.
- Driver, it's getting late.
Don't fret, Your Honor.
We're just fixing to leave as soon as l count my money.
- Count your what?
- Soon as I water my mule.
Watering his mule? What on earth does he mean?
- I'll explain it to you later.
- How far is it to town?
- Deaddog's...
- Twenty miles.
- And Gila City is about...
- Same old 20 miles.
- I don't see any mules.
- Looks like you could use another stop.
Wouldn't be no good without water.
This stage appears to me to be driven by horses.
Please.
No water between Gila and Deaddog?
Nope.
Sure don't seem to bother me none.
Daniel, are you going to do something or am l?
Be worth a lot if a fella was to find it?
Worth a damn sight more than gold.
- Driver, it's getting dark.
- Generally does about this time.
- Damnedest thing I ever saw.
- Get him to start this vehicle.
Got enough water to hold you?
- Never, anywhere.
- Just, Daniel.
- Yep.
- I demand you start this vehicle at once.
Fellas?
Sure do. Well, many thanks,...
- ... till you're better paid.
- Start this vehicle. l am going to report you to your superiors.
You shall never drive again, do you hear?
The wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience.
- Ephesians, chapter 5, verse 6.
- Amen.
Hallelujah, brother! The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
Matthew, chapter 2...
When are you coming back?
Next week. You sure you don't wanna ride with us?
No. l'll be right here, Hogue.
Hey, feller.
Hey, hold up there a minute, feller.
That's 10 cents. That's my water.
My land, my water.
- Found it where it wasn't. Ten cents.
- Here's your pay.
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Is that so?
- Give me that rifle.
- I'll give you what's in it.
Now get out.
Drop by again. Always open for business.
You're my first customer.
Appears to me you've been 17 kinds of a damn fool.
Not that it seems to bother you none.
Peace and goodwill, brother. l come as a friend.
- Careful, son. I'm a man of God.
- Well, you damn near joined him.
- Anybody with you?
- I'm alone. l am the Reverend Joshua Duncan
Sloane, preacher to all of eastern Nevada...
- ... and selected parts of northern Arizona.
- Well, you're a sorry preacher.
And a hell of a sneak. ln my case, sir, those thus attributed often go hand in hand.
And speaking of such, here is mine in all good fellowship. l'm Cable Hogue.
That's rather an unusual name, isn't it?
You have builded an oasis out of this wilderness.
No, I just stumbled on that mud hole over there and I dug it out a little.
You might call this place
Cable Springs. Sound good?
Yeah.
That excavation, a wine cellar perhaps?
No, that's a three-holer. Expecting a lot of business. l see tragedy has already struck this cactus Eden.
No, that's no tragedy.
Shot the son of a bitch. With his own rifle. He tried to kill me.
He was my first customer. You're my second.
Well said and well done. Defend thyself with the jawbone of an ass if need be.
You're a Good Samaritan to offer help...
- ... to a needy traveler...
- Hallelujah, brother. At 10 cents a head.
Water to men, sheep and hogs, 10 cents.
Horses, mules and cows, 2 bits.
- Of course.
- In advance.
Which means before you drink, you pay 10 cents. In advance.
Cast thy bread upon the waters, let this man have his just needs.
You talk like a man of God, all right. But l worked like hell for that there water.
My poor, misguided friend, you are a sinner in need of redemption. l will redeem you.
Ten cents, you pious bastard, or l'll bury you.
What church did you say you was with?
The Church of the Wayfaring
Stranger. A church of my own revelation.
Just like that?
- Just like that.
- Where's it located?
Wherever l go, it goes with me.
Would you like to see some of my parishioners? Sisters of the spirit.
Why, that one's naked as a jaybird's ass.
Naked we come into this earth, naked we shall return.
Well, Brother Hogue. l foresee a great community springing out of the sand.
Busy thoroughfares, alabaster buildings...
... a thriving community filled with the faithful.
- Amen.
- How much of this land is yours?
To sell, of course. l wish to buy.
- Well, considerable.
- I didn't see any boundary stakes anywhere. l suppose you've been too busy to go into the land office and file your claim.
You know, if anyone were to drop a word of this in Deaddog or Lizard...
... there would be 47 men riding out here by sundown...
... with a claim in one hand and a gun in the other.
Yes, this information could mean quite a lot of money...
What a blessing religion must be, preacher. lt touches my heart.
The loan of your horse. lt's nothing, my friend. Ride in good health with my blessing. l hate to go in among them...
... but you've shown me the way to salvation and a secured claim.
My only aim in life is to help the misbegotten, the downtrodden...
... and the members of my parish.
God bless you, preacher.
Make yourself to home.
Only don't forget, every time you take a drink, leave 10 cents in the cup...
... or I'll blow your ass into next wednesday.
Come on, get up there.
Well, get in...
... get it over with;...
... then, get out.
Please, miss.
Yes?
Please.
Well, hell, could you tell me where the land office is?
Well, you're looking right at it.
Can't you see the sign?
Well, you see, miss, I...
Well, hell, l don't read too goddamn good. My name's Cable Hogue.
Which one is it? lt's right there, with the white sign.
Thank you kindly, miss.
The stage office? lt's kitty-corner from here, across from the bank.
- Thank you, miss.
- My pleasure.
Thank you truly.
How much it cost to file?
Will this be under the Desert
Land Act or homesteaded?
Well, l wanna do what's right.
Under the Desert Land Act, an individual can file for up to 320 acres...
... at a dollar and a quarter an acre.
Plus proof of reclamation.
Now, whoa. Hold up there, fella.
What the hell does all that mean?
Land without water is not allowable. lf you can't substantiate either agricultural...
Hold on there, fella. l got water.
Water?
- Where?
- West.
Eight miles through that Red Rock pass. Off by the wagon road there.
- Seems to be open at present, but...
- But my ass.
- There's no water there.
- Yeah? Come on out. lf you can't drink it, l'll fry that claim paper.
Speaking of which, where is it?
All right. What's your name?
Cable Hogue.
C, a, b, l, e or e, l?
How do you spell Cable? lf you're bogging down on
Cable, wait till you get to Hogue.
- How much it gonna cost?
- Dollar and a quarter an acre.
Here.
What will that buy me?
- That will buy you two acres.
- Hang it in, then.
Let's see what it'll do, as the lady said to the sailor.
- Two acres, Mr. Hogue?
- It's legal, ain't it?
- Well, yeah.
- Mark it.
Two acres at Cable Springs, signed, sealed and delivered!
- You put her down right there.
- Yes, sir.
- I want a copy on my desk.
- Right away, sir.
You the boss here?
I'm Quittner.
Well, l'll bet you ain't no quitter, are you?
So you bought yourself a claim for two dollars and a half.
- So what?
- So it was every last cent I had. l can believe it.
Where is this claim, Mr...?
C, a, b, l, e.
- lt's at Jackass Flats, about a mile...
- What you got out there...
... is so important you gotta bother me with it?
You trying to tell me you found water between here and Gila?
If you was to give me 35,00 USD,...
... I'd cut you in for half.
This stage line's been operating for 35 years.
We've looked under every rock between here and Gila. lf there was water in that
40 miles, we'd have found it.
- I'm telling you straight.
- No,... l've had my belly full of broken-down prospectors, hoboes...
... and get rich quick on my money promoters.
Every one of you comes by here is trying to gouge money out of me.
You're the only son of a bitch that ever had the gall to pour water on my britches.
Now, l let you talk, l listened to you and l'm not interested.
Get out and stay out, partner.
- By God, this is worth something.
- Yeah, worth two acres of Jackass Flats.
- Eleven hundred.
- Twelve.
Thirteen fifty.
- Forty, 45.
- That's 1 500.
One thousand one, two...
- Ninety two hundred.
- ... three, four,...
- ... five, six...
- Twenty five, thirty...
- Something I can do for you?
- That chunk of paper there?
That's me. Mine.
Across the street there, they think l'm lying. They say there's no water.
Listen. l was robbed and left to die without a drop.
Well, do l look dead?
No, sir. Climbed up on my hind feet and walked straight to water.
W, a, t, l, e.
That grabs you by the short hairs, don't it?
- You've got the floor.
- Those silly jackasses over there...
... can laugh at me all they want, but they're in trouble.
Wouldn't you think a stage line could see that? ln all the long, wrought-out, back-breaking, kidney-shaking, bladder-busting miles...
... from here to Lizard, there's not one spot of wet relief for man nor beast.
Now, if l could bring comfort to the passengers, rest to the teams...
... food and drink to the drivers and water to all,...
... what would be wrong with that? A preacher out at my diggings will tell you.
- Would you doubt a man of the Gospel?
- Of course. That's the first man I'd doubt.
By golly. l'll be damned.
Looks like l came to the right place after all.
What do you want?
Grubstake.
Thirty-five of them green ones.
Have you any collateral?
Do you own anything?
- Why, sure. I told you, there.
- That is 2,00 USD and a half.
Well, l'm worth something, ain't l? l want to hear more.
- Why?
- Why not?
I always thought you bankers stole for the rich.
- I didn't know you'd talk to trash like me.
- We don't steal.
Well, lend, borrow, invest and mortgage and repossess.
What the hell else do you call it?
What's your name?
Cable, with an l, e.
So, Mr. Cable Hogue...
... is 35,00 USD all you want?
Will a hundred get you started?
Hey, Hildy, you got a new customer.
Go on in, mister.
She's just waiting for you. Go on in.
Standing like a jackass eating cactus.
Yes?
Hello.
Did you want to see me?
Well, come on in.
Honey, you was smelling bad enough to gag a dog off a gut wagon. l smell a lot better right now though.
Hey, look at that. lnside plumbing.
As good as anything you'll find in Kansas City.
Sweet glory, love.
Well, l had to get you rinsed off, didn't l? l swear l never seen a man so dirty.
You know, you must have had a pound of dirt on you.
Well, feel a lot lighter now, Millie.
My name is Hildy.
Well.
Now, don't you be mixing me up with them other ones.
Don't worry. l won't.
You know, honey...
... if you're ever thinking of quitting this job,...
... I'm building myself a place. lt's gonna be something.
No. l've had enough of this damn desert.
Not me. Not yet. l'm on my way up.
Undo me.
San Francisco is my next stop.
- And when I hit Frisco...
- Noisy, god awful, claptrap town.
I'm gonna hit it in style.
Two days and you're tired of it. l ain't even got there yet.
You'll get there, all right.
You bet your sweet life l will.
One way or another, love.
And when l do hit Frisco...
... I'm gonna be the ladiest damn lady you ever seen. l'm gonna marry me the richest man in San Francisco.
Maybe the two richest men. lt's just a question of time.
Well, if you ever need any help...
- You remember my name?
- You remember mine?
Come here.
God's pure and natural elements are being threatened by the devil, yes.
Sinners.
What's wrong?
The devil seeks to destroy you with machines!
Ask me how l know.
There are those of us who talk to
God. God talked to me the other day.
He said:
"Inventions are the work of Satan.
Tell them how it is, James." l gotta go. That pious son of a bitch could have sold me out.
- What?
- Taking the stage to Gila. Sold me out.
- Come here.
- "Turn your backs.
And gather by the river with me, James."
That's what the Almighty said.
Lost it. No good.
Trouble is,... I forgot to mark my boundaries.
Build me a claim monument.
- What in the hell are you talking about?
- Just know it.
- Bother me.
- Bother you?
All the way through it.
Keep thinking of that damn preacher out there.
Maybe come here to cheat me.
Hell of a time to hold a goddamn prayer meeting!
What is the matter with you?
What?
- Ain't you forgetting something?
- What?
Well, what about me?
Me and my money.
For what?
Well, if you don't want me here.
Easy.
Hold up there, now. Careful.
- Didn't take you long, mister.
- Just a damn minute.
Hildy, listen to me. l told you.
He's gonna take the stage to Gila.
Sold me out.
- I'll be back.
- Back, hell. You'll pay me now.
Look at him go! Where's he going?
Attagirl, Hildy.
- There you are, you son of a bitch.
- I told you I'd be back.
- You call yourself a man?
- Well, of course I do.
- I got business at the springs.
- You got business with me.
Now, get up here and settle up.
- Later, Hildy.
- Later, hell!
Well, you know how it is, folks. Women.
Just a damn minute, Cable!
- Brothers, peace. Everything will be all right.
- Take your hands off of me.
- Not you. You!
- Will you get off my face? ls that you, Robert? What are you doing?
Get ahold of him, Frank. He's getting away.
Get him.
Go get him, Frank!
Nasty man, we'll never see you again.
- Hope he breaks his neck.
- Get the hell out of here.
- Come on, let's ride him out of here
- Why, you son of a bitch? lt's all right, folks.
Yeah, it's all right.
Hey, come back here!
Cable Hogue, you're no damn good!
- I'll be back.
- You aren't either.
You hussy!
Welcome back to the fold, brother.
Drink up, preacher.
Gonna get spruced up. Going back in amongst them. l got unfinished business in Deaddog.
Amen.
Thank you.
- That collar comes off as easy as it goes on.
- Of course. lf l cannot rouse heaven, l intend to raise hell.
You see? l told you. Went clean through.
She took her.
Children, we are gathered here under the sight of the Lord Almighty...
Not now, Josh.
Now, Josh.
Children, we are gathered here under the sight of the Lord Almighty...
Cable Hogue, take off your damn boots.
Now, that's better.
Well, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
Good evening.
Just passing through.
Yes?
My apologies for intruding in your time of obvious grief...
... but being a man of the cloth,
I could not pass your door...
... without at least offering you the solace of my services.
I am Reverend Joshua Duncan Sloane.
Reverend, thank you for coming.
Come, child, take my hand.
The Lord works in many ways.
Sometimes, when he has dealt too much for one to bear...
... he sends a messenger to comfort and love.
- He does?
- Yes.
Such a messenger am l.
Come, child, lay your head on my shoulder.
This is a shoulder for the grieving...
... a hand to be gripped in despair,...
... a vial to pour one's heart into.
My only mission in life is that of comfort and love...
- ... which I humbly offer you now.
- Thank you, reverend.
Now...
... what great weight can
I lift from your tortured soul?
It's Frank.
Where?
He's dead. l just got the telegram today. Happened in Gila.
- How terrible.
- He's been gone two days and two weeks.
How pitiful.
Weep your heart into mine, child, for it is weeping with you. l will be the reservoir for your sorrow. And your guide for a brighter tomorrow.
Reverend Sloane, it's so good to know that somebody cares.
Thank not me, sister. l am but an emissary of the kingdom of heavenly love.
Out of the depth of your sorrow...
... we shall find the beauty of his love.
Even now as we stand here in his shadow...
... feel your grief subside,...
... as I absorb it through my palm and into my hand. l do, Reverend.
Feel your pain...
... flowing freely...
... out of your heart...
... and into my hand. l feel it.
Come, child.
Together we shall purge this grief from your soul...
... and release your true spirit as we search a path to righteousness.
Claudia, it's me.
It's my husband.
- But he's the telegram.
- No, that's Frank, my brother.
Clete doesn't know yet.
Open the goddamn door.
Would you help console Clete like you did me?
They were very close.
- What the hell is going on here?
- Silence.
There's been a death in the family.
It's Frank. He's dead.
Kneel.
Bow your heads. ln this, your moment of need, l will comfort you.
Yea, l will comfort you.
And bring you to a better understanding of the mysteries of life...
... and death...
... and love.
Thank you, Reverend. l loved that kid,
Reverend. Crazy loon that he was. l know.
She was a treasure waiting to be found.
A dew-kissed flower sparkling in the sunrise.
- Her breath was that of a wanton angel.
- She's married. l shall walk in her breezes, bask in the rays of her beauty...
... lie in the golden arches of her passions.
Brother Hogue, it grieves me bad to think of her with that goliath.
Your cup run dry, preacher.
Man's a poor sport when another pleasures his woman. l don't pleasure them, brother
Hogue. l baptize them...
... with loving care. That's all she needs.
There's been a death in the family, and she needs help. My help.
Her husband will give her all the help she needs or wants.
Who gives her all the help she needs and wants? You, brother?
Hildy ain't mine.
Nobody owns Hildy. She's got her life and l got mine, right here.
Right where l wanna be.
That's not exactly true, Cable.
You love that girl.
Hey, up and at them! You're no help to me sitting there on your ass!
Brother, sometimes l question your sanity.
You don't know nothing about swapping. l gave a week's watering rights for all this.
- That's a man's swap.
- You can't sleepm unless...
- ... you're bedded on lizards and rocks?
- It ain't true.
Only thing l like about cities. City beds.
- My little Claudia springs to mind.
- I'll just bet she does. l ought to venture into
Deaddog and pay my respects.
- Burning with passion, preacher?
- What about yours, Brother Hogue? l ain't never had a passion.
What do you call that vengeance that gnaws at your soul?
That's the passion that'll nurture the dandelions above your grave.
Taggart and Bowen left me to die. lf my feet don't get cold and my legs will stay under me...
... I aim to kill them.
I don't call that a passion.
- "Vengeance is mine", sayeth the Lord.
- Well, that's fair enough with me.
Just as long as he don't take too long and l can watch.
Get up there!
Did it ever occur to you, Cable...
... how wise and bountiful God was...
... to put breasts on a woman?
Just the right number in just the right place. Ever notice that?
Well, where in the hell else would he put them? On their backside? lt's a thought.
Have you ever noticed a female person's legs?
Of course l have. Some go all the way up to the lady's ass, others stop below.
The thigh, the soft abundance of the female thigh. Have you ever noticed?
There appears to be...
... a small hole in the sack.
- Howdy, Mr. Cushing.
- Afternoon.
- Thought I might pay you a visit.
- Well, this is it.
- Cable Springs.
- You've done remarkable things with 1,00 USD.
Thank you, Mr. Cushing.
- I see you've got neighbors.
- Fred, keep that thing working.
Yeah, they'd like to be.
- Tell me, have they found anything?
- Not a drop.
And they've been digging for 13 days.
Any sign of water down there, fellas?
Looks like l bought the right two acres, eh, fellas?
All right, Hogue, all right. l give up, damn it.
Don't fill up the holes. Just pick up those ladders.
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Let's go get a drink.
Never did like water anyway.
Good afternoon, Mr. Cushing.
Well, you got us, Hogue. We're beat.
Here's your contract. l've already signed it.
Everything comes to he who waits.
Just sign your name right there.
That makes it official. You're in business, Cable.
By the way, Hogue, l reckon this is about the most important thing of all.
- Yeah? What's it gonna cost me?
- Nothing.
Well, now. lf that don't beat all.
Gonna have to buy you a flagpole. l'll make my own.
Hey there.
More, please.
Would you mind if l had a tiny bit more also? lt's really very tasty.
- Good heavens.
- Nailed them down.
Makes them easier to wash.
Keep track.
- It's delicious.
- Desert stew.
- Good, fresh meat.
- What's in it?
- Jack rabbit.
- "Coq au vin".
What's "coq au vin"?
Breast of quail, dove thighs, that sort of thing.
Yeah. Rattlesnake, ground squirrel...
... black gopher, horny toad, grasshoppers for seasoning...
... and pack rats and prairie dogs to fill in.
Of course, if you get ahold of a wild onion, that'll help.
You see, out here what you gotta do is, you gotta work and make do.
Hey, wait a minute, there's dessert!
Matthew, stop eating that!
Matthew, l'll spank the living daylights out of you.
All aboard.
Now, I said hurry, Matthew. Come on.
All right, let's go, folks. All aboard for Deaddog!
Cable, l'm off into Deaddog. The call is upon me and cannot be ignored...
- ... without endangering my soul.
- Your soul?
- Careful your ass don't get full of buckshot.
- I'm doing the Lord's work. lt's a hell of a name to call it. l reckon you're right.
- Josh, tell Hildy...
- I will, Cable. I'll give her your love.
That's all you can do. You can't convince Hildy with anything but hard cash!
We'll see about that, Cable.
Hildy, l don't know why you're here, but l'm mighty glad you are. l was asked to leave.
By the good people of the town.
Good people? l never met any.
Except you.
Ain't got around to doing my dishes yet.
Sun makes them real pure, you see.
See Joshua?
Surely did.
He talks a lot, Cable,...
... and well too.
But, you know, l just ain't ready to be saved yet.
You make yourself to home. Right at home. l'll be right back.
Now?
You've been awful nice to me, Hogue.
Never bothered you none what l am?
Hell, no, it never bothered me. l enjoyed it.
Well, what the hell are you?
Human being. Try the best you can.
- We all got our own ways of living.
- And loving?
Gets mighty lonesome without it.
You know, Miss Hildy, sometimes out here alone at night...
Well, sometimes, l wonder what the hell l'm doing out here.
- Why don't you live in town?
- I don't know about that. ln town l'd be nothing. l don't like being nothing.
Been that before.
Out here l, well...
... got a good start.
- If you'd like to stay on awhile...
- Hogue, it's not my kind of life. l can't stay. We just don't think the same.
San Francisco for me.
But not tonight.
Now, that is a picture.
You've seen it before.
Lady...
...nobody's ever seen you before.
Get on, boy!
Get up, boy!
Three hours early.
- What?
- Stagecoach.
Well, go get me a robe. lt's too little. Go get my robe.
Welcome to Cable Springs.
Get up there!
Won't be here much longer. lf l don't go now, won't be much use in going later.
Soon as they come.
What if they never come?
Whoa, whoa, boy. lt ain't worth it, Hogue.
Revenge always turns sour.
You ought to just forget them.
Some things a man can't forget. l got me two of them, Taggart and Bowen. l've been waiting a long time, Hildy.
Well, you couldn't handle them last time.
Next time you'll probably just get yourself killed.
Even if you did get them, and you got to San Francisco, how'd you find me?
Don't you worry none about that. l'll find you.
But it's a big town, Hogue. A real city. l don't care where you are, Hildy. l said l'd find you and l aim to do just that.
And quit changing the subject. l think he's after me, Cable.
- He's gonna kill me.
- Then keep moving.
- I'm serious.
- So am I.
She was not a sister in purity. l found her weeping by the stable. Clete had taken to drink and left the child.
- And?
- Well, I consoled her for days.
Lovely days and nights. He returned, the woman went to him...
- ... confessed and begged for forgiveness.
- So?
He never forgave me. He swears l won't leave this desert alive.
- Good luck, preacher.
- Every moment we argue,...
- ... death rides closer. We're in trouble.
- We? I never diddled nobody's wife.
To err is human, brother, to forgive is divine.
Somebody's coming.
You better hide yourself.
- Don't go in the bedroom, Hildy's in there.
- From Deaddog?
That's the one. And you better behave, or l'll come gunning for you.
Morning, Preacher Sloane.
Good morning, Hildy.
- Can I help you, mister?
- Yeah, whose horse is that?
- Which one?
- The one that's all lathered up.
That.
That's mine.
- What's its name?
- That? That's...
Old Alexander. l will protect you. The violence might spread inside.
Joshua, what the hell do you think you're doing?
Funny name for a mare.
Well...
... like the lady said to the sailor, it all depends on how you look at it.
Yea, l will protect you as a shepherd protects his flock.
Yeah, well, l heard about them sheepherders...
... and you ain't sticking my feet in your boots.
You listen to me. l want that son of a bitch. l'll pay a hundred dollars in gold, wet or dry, dead or alive.
A hundred dollars?
- If I see him, you'll get him.
- I better.
So long, fella.
- Don't forget.
- I won't.
You better not.
Preacher! l told you to stay the hell out of there!
Thank you, Cable, for sanctuary.
- My dear, this smells delicious.
- Thank you, Joshua.
- It is good.
- Hold up there, preacher.
- That'll be 50 cents.
- That's hardly fair.
- Not fair? He should pay me double.
- Why? You haven't charged me nothing.
That's because you haven't charged me nothing.
Brother, you really are a true samaritan.
Don't push your luck, Josh.
- Wouldn't you like to say grace, reverend?
- Not over my food.
Very well, then, l'll say grace.
Dear Lord, we thank thee for all this good food...
... and that we can share it as one.
We thank thee for thy goodness and thy mercy.
Bless this food, Lord,...
And bless this house.
Amen.
Thank you, Hildy.
... I'll be leaving tomorrow.
You knew l was only gonna stay one day, maybe two. lt's been over three weeks already.
- It can't be.
- Has, though.
Guess l got used to your cooking and all. lt has been nice hearing you sing. l admit, l thought a lot about staying.
You treated me like a real lady, Hogue.
You were good to me.
Not good enough?
Maybe too good, l don't know. l just can't handle it.
Thank you very much for everything, but l'm leaving.
Excuse me.
Sort of lost my appetite. l better find you a place to sleep, preacher.
No need.
That bed in there will suit me just fine and dandy. lt's fine and dandy, but it ain't yours.
Well, isn't a guest entitled to bed and board?
A paying guest.
Stop it. Both of you gonna sleep outside tonight.
Outside, both of you.
Good night, Cable.
Morning, brother
Hogue. Sleep well last night?
Nope.
- Is Hildy up yet?
- Left early.
- How do you know?
- Well, you know how it is, Josh.
Funny thing...
... it doesn't matter how much or how little you've wandered around,...
... how many women you've been with.
Every once in awhile, one of them...
... cuts right through.
Right straight into you.
What do you do about it? l suppose maybe when you die you get over it.
So long, Cable. lt's me!
Right here!
Waiting.
Right here! Waiting!
Come on, boy. Get with it.
Come on, Blackie! Get in.
Get in there, boy.
Whoa, boy.
Don't feed them, we're just staying long enough to water the horses.
- And we're running late.
- All right, Ben.
Welcome to Cable Springs. lt's out in the back, ma'am. l was wondering and worrying if you got out of there all right. Glad you made it.
Howdy, Cable.
Come on and have a drink of the best damn water for 50 mile around. l found it where it wasn't.
- How long you had this place?
- Three years and a half.
Pretty big layout.
Well, l owe it all to you boys.
When l come out of there, l found this water hole and just went into business.
Looks like you done real well.
Big, fat bankbook, Cable?
Hogue in a bank? You don't know him better than that, you don't know him at all.
Here you go, Cable.
Another month paid in full.
No, no banks for me. l'll just put this in the old sock, and l got it well hid.
- We're so glad to hear you're doing so well.
- If I was doing half as good,...
... I'd be a rich son of a bitch instead of just a poor one.
All right, folks, let's go! All aboard for Deaddog!
Well, l owe it all to you boys.
Now, you come back and see me, now, you hear?
- We will.
- One of these days.
Now, you can count on it.
Blackie, get out of there. Come on, boy.
Get out of there.
- See you, Hogue.
- So long, Ben.
Taggart and Bowen, as quick as you please,...
Took all the money and left for the trees
We come for that visit. l don't think he's here.
No, l don't think he is.
You check inside.
Come on, get up there.
We'll drink all your water, Cable.
We'll drink your well dry.
Water goes good with a bottle of rye
Just lookie what we got here.
Another one.
What do you think?
Well, we found the copper.
Gold and silver gotta be next.
Why in hell don't we just wait till he comes back?
- Let him do the digging?
- Suits me, boys.
- You heard that.
- Shut up.
Come on out.
With your hands up, fellas.
Think it over. l got lots of time.
What's he doing?
Well, l ain't gonna poke my head over the edge to find out.
You know you ain't got no guts.
Why, last time you had a gun on us you didn't use it.
Yeah, now, of course that's a fact.
You said l was yellow.
Wanna try your luck again?
- He's bluffing.
- Yeah!
Sun's kind of hot, ain't it, fellas?
Of course you could enjoy it if you had plenty of water.
And that's what l got, plenty of water.
- Get over. Right up there.
- Right there. l ain't running this time, fellas.
- Staying right here.
- Your gun.
- Sooner or later you gotta come out.
- Three count. Ready?
One, two...
... now!
- We got him.
- He might still be alive.
Take a look.
- You're sure?
- Damn it, take a look.
Give me a boost.
Easy and up we go.
Little higher, Taggart.
- Get up there.
- No. Just easy.
Put me down, damn it.
- We never touched him.
- Where is he?
Well, why in the hell don't you take a look?
Now what's he up to?
My God. Taggart, help me.
Son of a bitch, Taggart. Please, Taggart.
God.
- Taggart, I'm leaving this place.
- Not without me.
Hold up there, boys.
Now, you can start taking off your duds.
Get them off.
Keep your underwear, that's all.
And your boots, get them off.
Boots.
Socks too.
Now...
... you're gonna head back out through them hills.
Because if l catch you on a road, l'm gonna kill you.
But there's no water.
And don't that sound familiar? l ain't going.
You ain't got the guts, Hogue.
No.
Hey, what's that?
- What?
- That. l seen one once before.
- Out here, on them roads?
- It go anywhere.
Help!
He's gonna kill me!
Stop!
You damn dumb bastards.
Horseless carriage. Don't look that good to me.
Went right on by.
Well...
... that's gonna be the next fella's worry. l can't go it out there, Cable.
- That right?
- It wasn't my fault.
All I did was... l'm sorry, Cable.
You know how it was with Taggart.
Yeah, l know.
Bury him.
He's under.
Good.
What else would you like me to do?
What kind of a cockeyed schedule is this?
Ain't got no passengers, just two, three sacks of mail.
Well, it don't matter really. l'm leaving.
- Leaving?
- You leaving the desert? lt's a big world, fellas. l wanna see some of it.
Next stop, San Francisco.
You serious?
So you're really going in amongst them, Hogue?
- Shoot, that ain't like you.
- Ain't it?
- You just watch me.
- He means it.
- You bet I mean it.
- Now, hold on.
You just can't up and leave the station like this.
Well, what are we gonna do between Deaddog and Lizard?
Gentlemen, l'd like you to meet my former partner...
Hey, get some clothes on.
Yes, sir.
Now, wait a minute.
You can't leave some fool...
...running around in his long johns in charge here.
My God, what's that?
Ugly-looking damn thing, ain't it?
Kind of strange, moving all by itself. l seen two before.
That there lady is Hildy.
The ladiest damn lady l ever saw. l beg your pardon, sir.
- Might l borrow a tank of water.
- No.
Mr. Cable Hogue don't let nobody borrow nothing.
How much water you think this thing will take?
Three, maybe four horses' worth?
Well, how the hell would l know? You're in charge here, Bowen.
That'll be five horses' worth, not a cent less.
Pull it up on the rise and help me fetch the water.
Get that damn thing out of here...
... before my team takes a notion to tromp the hell out of it.
Hildy, you do look fine. l guess you found one of those rich husbands you was always looking for.
Well, let's just put it this way, Hogue. l ain't hurting no more. l was just headed for New Orleans. l stopped by to check to see if maybe you was ready. l'm ready.
You'd leave your desert, Hogue?
Hell, l've already gone, honey. l'll go get ready. l'll be back in a minute.
We got nothing but time, Hogue...
... nothing but time.
Hey, fellas, l'm headed for
New Orleans, in style.
By God, l wish l was going with you. l seen two before. l guess you need the water for the steam, huh?
- No. It burns gasoline.
- Yeah, burns it.
Did you hear that, Cable? lt burns gasoline.
Well, of course it does.
You know, maybe a fella could pick up some extra money selling that too.
That gasoline.
Mister, that'll cost you 10 cents more.
- Hogue, watch out.
- Hold it.
My God.
Son of a bitch kicks worse than a mule.
- You hurt, Cable?
- Hell, I'm all right.
No, l'm not.
Hell, Hogue. lt's a long ways from your heart and on the wrong side.
Well, thanks, fellas.
Much better out here.
Well, Brother Hogue.
What's all this?
What in the hell is that?
Just a means of transportation.
- Well, it sure is an ugly thing.
- You don't look so good, Cable.
- Are you in trouble?
- No trouble, just dying. Last reckoning.
Well, it comes to us all. Prepare yourself, Cable.
Shut up, Joshua. It ain't so.
You'll be up and around in no time.
Yep. l wanna thank you for what you've done.
And here l waited three years to get even with you. l was gonna piss on your grave.
Well, boys, when l go just bury me where the sand's soft and the digging's easy.
Hush, Cable. You're gonna be just fine.
That man you was married to...
He died about a month back of a stroke, in bed.
But he died happy. l'll just bet he did.
As a matter of fact, if you gents would be kind enough to move me inside...
... I'd kind of like to throw a little...
- Hang in there.
- Brother Hogue,...
... this is a time for deep and serious reflection; not of base and vile lust.
Josh, it's about time you earned your keep.
- Preach me a funeral sermon.
- For heaven's sake.
A good one. Don't make me out no saint, but don't put me down too deep.
- You mean now?
- Yeah. lt's not so much the dying that you hate...
... it's not knowing what they're gonna say about you, that's all.
Now, all my life l've been scared of this living.
Gotta do the other.
Well, come on, now, l can't wait all day. l ain't got any time.
- Brethren!
- Bull's eye! See?
We are gathered here...
... in the sight of God and all his glory...
- ... to lay to rest Cable Hogue.
- Amen to that.
Now, most funeral orations, Lord, lie about a man.
Compare him to the angels, whitewash him with a really wide brush.
But, you know, Lord, and l know that it just is not true.
Hang in there, preacher.
Now, a man is made out of bad as well as good, all of us.
Cable Hogue was born into this world, nobody knows when or where.
He came stumbling out of the wilderness like a prophet of old.
Sounds right, is right.
Out of the barren wastes he carved himself a one-man kingdom.
- I don't know.
- Some said he was ruthless.
- Who said that?
- More than one, Hogue.
But you could do worse, Lord...
... than to take to your bosom Cable Hogue.
He wasn't really a good man, he wasn't a bad man.
But, Lord, he was a man.
Amen to that.
He charged too much...
... he was as stingy as they come.
Yes, he might have cheated, but he was square about it.
Rich or poor, he gouged them all the same.
When Cable Hogue died...
... there wasn't an animal in the desert he didn't know.
There wasn't a star in the firmament he hadn't named.
There wasn't a man he was afraid of.
Now the sand he fought and loved so long has covered him at last.
Now he has gone into the whole torrent of the years...
... of the souls that pass and never stop. ln some ways he was your dim reflection, Lord...
... and right or wrong, I feel he is worth consideration.
But if you feel he is not...
... you should know that Hogue lived and then died here in the desert.
And l'm sure hell will never be too hot for him.
He never went to church.
He didn't need to.
The whole desert was his cathedral.
Hold up! l'm coming in tonight.
Hogue loved the desert...
... loved it deeper than he'd ever say.
He built his empire...
... but was man enough to give it up for love when the time came.
Lord, as the day draws toward evening, this life grows to an end for us all.
We say "adieu" to our friend.
Take him, Lord.
But knowing Cable, l suggest you do not take him lightly.
Amen.
God will punish you, Jelly Roll.
You scared the bejesus out of me.
Well, it ain't smart to live alone, Tom.
You start seeing scary shadows.
Red shadows.
God will fry those savages in hell.
I see them dragging their beasts and belongings through the valley.
And I think,
"What a waste of the Promised Land."
You see here.
These little flags are us.
All this nothing is them.
- Does it make sense to you?
- It's Indian territory.
Every Friday in the days of the Spanish conquest they used to kill 12 savages in memory of the 12 Holy Apostles.
Those traditions ought to be kept up.
Hundreds of fine, Christian souls are waiting for this land.
And willing to pay good prices for it.
Not everybody's as good a Christian as you.
Nowadays you need a practical excuse for killing Indians.
Like Major Cabot.
When he found all them wells poisoned.
We know, sure, in some way the major did a bit of poisoning himself.
But he found lots of Indian beads round those wells, didn't he?
All we need is an excuse.
Why don't we cook one up ourselves?
We get undressed like those savages and get rid of some white trash loner.
'Fess up, Tom.
You've been chewing the fat with Major Cabot.
No I ain't. Why?
You're saying exactly the same he's been saying.
That's because him and me are practical people.
- Pioneers of the old frontier.
- No.
It's because you're both made of the same clay.
You both got the evil genius in you.
Good old Cabot.
Tell me, you fellas decided yet who you're gonna scalp?
Hey, Frank!
Bring the gent a cup of coffee.
"Oh, look at my body."
Stop it, man.
You're hurting the fleas.
Looked like a rooster dance, didn't it?
You're smart to grease that barrel.
If you want some good advice, file down the sight too.
- Why's that?
- Why?
Sooner or later, strangers around here get their guns shoved up their...
- Don't want to get scratched, do you?
- Thanks.
Thanks? Thanks for what?
It's my name, Joe Thanks.
I'm impressed. I really am.
Hey!
- I know you.
- Do you now?
Yeah. You're the village idiot!
Somebody welcomes me like that in every town.
You wouldn't talk like that if I had a gun on me.
I'm looking for a man who can shoot fast.
How fast?
Not one who shoots first but if somebody shoots at him he won't shoot second.
You sound like a hard fella to please.
But you might give
Doc Foster a try.
Doc, one of these days you're going to have to get up from this table and go on out and see what's going on out there.
Not a thing, never will be.
This town's one long Sunday afternoon.
Careful, it's very hot.
Last I saw my missus she was nine months heavy.
For all I know I got a family now.
Let me go home, Doc.
I'm waiting for somebody.
Somebody's already here.
- He ain't somebody.
- Nobody at all.
- Sorry, Doc.
- For what? Keep going.
Two.
One.
- Pass.
- Same here.
- Ten just to keep things going.
- Ten.
Up to 100.
What happens in this game when a fella's got four cards alike?
What happens is, I'm out.
Same here.
Four aces in the same hand.
Never saw the like in all my born days.
Even when I cheated.
Give this a try, Doc.
Colt Navy, model '86.
These nice folks are wanting to see a duel.
- What duel?
- You know how it is in the West.
Two fellas come out of the saloon and stand opposite each other.
One usually has his legs spread apart.
Folks in the town get scared, and edge backward to a safe distance.
Somebody plays a funeral march on a bugle in the background.
Then nothing.
Not a sound.
Only the whistling wind from the desert.
Let me tell you the rest.
In a few minutes you'll be one of the deadest men that ever lived.
- Outside! My time's precious.
- I know. You're waiting for somebody.
Hey. Come on, everyone!
Doc Foster and the big guy are gonna shoot it out.
They're gonna shoot it out, everyone!
Let's go.
When you're ready, Doc.
- Yours, Doc?
- Stand up. Stop acting like a booby.
Mighty pretty animal.
Don't play the clown.
Nobody takes care of you, huh?
- Poor critter was thirsty.
- Next shot's for you.
You hear me?
Sorry, Doc.
Shoot when you feel like it.
No, Doc. Uh-uh.
Did you like the show?
Good. That makes me happy.
If you'd be so kind.
Whatever you can afford.
Seems fair to me.
Anything you want to give, folks.
For the fastest gun on earth.
- Thanks.
- There you go, folks.
See! Even the wind is on our side.
Watch your head, watch your head.
Thanks. Thank you.
Thanks. Remember, folks.
You've just seen a risky show.
I mean, that is for Doc Foster.
Whatever you can afford.
I really appreciate it.
Thanks.
Thank you.
- There's people coming!
- For your collaboration.
A cavalry coach!
Free the horses and take them to the stables.
Give them water.
After resting they'll need fodder.
The Wild West.
We've been expecting young ladies to work in the boarding house.
- The boys made a mistake.
- Yes, electing you sheriff.
I'm a colonel.
For your information, my man, we're on our way to Fort Christabel.
Major Cabot might have sent someone to meet me.
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine...
Hey, Doc. You'd better pick it up.
Doc, why don't you just go home?
You've been lucky, friend.
I've got a job to do.
So have I.
Come in.
She was just a child. You hear me?
Only a child.
- Who?
- My sister!
You raped her, you never waited, promised to marry her.
- Her?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let them hear you!
I want you to get yours in front of everybody.
You ravished my only little sister!
- The man is a maniac!
- You broke her heart!
- He's not a maniac, he's an ass.
- What's it to you?
That beard!
That beard!
That's the key to it all.
What key?
- The key to the perfect plan.
- This ain't none of your business!
Good idea, Doc.
But this ain't none of your business.
- What are you doing?
- Go home.
- Out! Just go.
- Don't do that!
My balls!
Fascinating hand you got.
I never saw such a deep life line.
That's a scar. I disarmed a man once by grabbing his knife blade.
Life line interrupted.
It's going from bad to worse.
Death's waiting disguised as an Injun.
Don't join Cabot, you'll die.
You're a maniac too.
My friend has red whiskers like yours.
Fake, but you can't tell.
Let's send him to reconnoitre in your uniform.
Don't try to go to the fort yourself.
You'll get killed.
Lieutenant!
Men! Men!
Soldiers! Men!
- Carry on, I'm being followed.
- Are you a bandit?
Stop!
You don't look like those ruffians on the wanted posters.
Do they make you look ugly to frighten the public?
Well.
They're trying to show the evil that's inside us.
Stop!
- Kiss me!
- What?
Papa's sending me back to Washington.
I've never kissed an outlaw.
My girlfriends will die of envy.
Kiss me or I'll scream!
Sure.
A madman and a maniac were in my room.
They both pulled my beard.
I don't want them to escape.
Take them, men!
- There's a man in her bed!
- A man in her bed?
A man in her bed!
- Where?
- Right here.
Hey.
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Save me.
Just this once and I swear I'll never do it again.
He's over there.
Get out of here, you dogs.
Come on!
Leave me alone.
Get out of here!
My chickens!
My poor little chickens.
Hey, hey, come on now.
Leave me alone!
Oh, my poor chickens.
You a priest or a chicken thief?
Horrible beast.
Go on, get!
You Catholics keep chickens in church?
- We caught the wrong man.
- Right chicken, though.
Thieves. God will damn you!
He can't. We work for him.
You thieves. Chicken thieves.
Oh, my poor chickens.
Come, my sons.
Let's look for the real one.
- What kind of a place is this?
- A place of worship. Come on.
Climb aboard, kids. Get going.
Come on.
They're all beautiful girls.
As you can see.
- Where you going, friend?
- To see the madam.
Wait here and behave yourself.
- Mike, how you doing?
- Get a move on.
- Hey.
- You'll miss your connection.
It's solid silver and blessed by a priest.
They used to cut the hands off church robbers.
200 is my offer. Bag included.
Carousel's off to paradise right now.
What better way to spend your money?
Vamos, Maricones.
Are you, for a change, trying to screw me, madam?
- Lucy?
- The offer stays.
Take it or leave it.
Lucy!
Lucy, come back.
It's an order.
Climb aboard.
The girls are ready and waiting.
Steam Engine, I been looking for you.
Well, now that you've found me
I'll see you around.
Let's empty the hall.
Come on!
Wait, Bill.
I haven't seen him for ages.
- We hardly said hello.
- No more hellos.
- One more and you'll be expecting.
- So?
- Don't tease him. He gets jealous.
- Jealous!
I've more important things on my mind.
I pulled her out of the gutter.
She was a flea hive.
I washed her, combed her hair.
I made a lady out of her.
I surrounded her with luxury.
I catered to her every whim.
She's cost me an eye and an ear.
But I already told you.
If you want her, name your price.
I can't do it.
- She's priceless.
- Name your price, Joe.
Please, name your price.
Don't be surprised.
And do not jump to the wrong conclusions.
I'm only here to perform an act of justice.
There he is. That's him.
- Thou art the man.
- You an informer now?
You've been touched by God's grace.
Is that not so, my son?
- Admit it, Bill. You've been touched.
- I've been touched.
Is it in here, my son?
Check it carefully, Padre.
- Why did I save you in the desert?
- Because you never cheat a friend.
It's all there.
- Thanks be to God.
- Thanks be to Joe.
Just think of it. The man before you was already far away.
Free and clear.
When, like Paul on the road to Damascus, he was struck by God's heavenly light.
Burdened with remorse, he returned.
His heart heavy with despair for his misspent life in sin and shame.
- Who's he talking about?
- You.
Me? Why, you...
His noble gesture would not be known if it weren't for the testimony of this good soul.
I only did my duty as a faithful son of the Church.
Son of a bitch!
When the prodigal returns the heavens rejoice.
Glory, glory, glory.
On our knees we're bending.
Now the erring prodigal
Turns to the righteous way.
Glory, glory, glory.
Praying for thy blessing.
Our hearts in repentance
Pledge to Christ today.
Glory, glory, glory.
No hymns!
This is an honest house.
- We don't make fun of the Church.
- Joe!
- Where's he taking us?
- Keep counting!
Where was I? 315, 320.
$325 in charity.
That old bag only offered me 200.
You see, Bill.
Honesty is the best policy.
You're richer and a priest kissed you.
Disgusting!
Why do you have to act worse than you already are?
Sure, Twinkle-Toes here never pukes, does he?
He doesn't do it in his hat.
He knows to do it where decent folks do it. The privy.
You're wrong, Lucy.
If you'd spent less time walking the streets and more time sitting with decent folk on the privy, you'd have met Joe before me.
I've been dreaming a weird dream.
The red of the rising sun touches the mountains.
They seem bathed in blood.
The peaks throw long shadows down into the bottomless valley.
In the clear blue sky a hawk glides, wide and easy.
- The whistling wind?
- No.
The wings cleaving the air.
- What's that?
- Shh.
That's horses' hooves.
And now... from behind the rocks appears a man on a white horse.
He's the ancient ruler of these lands.
The shadow of a dead king reaches out for a fleeing man.
His silhouette is dark against the red sun.
Ringed with a halo of eagle feathers.
- Like rays of light.
- Oh, yeah?
It's your old man.
He's looking for you.
My old man never had feathers.
I'm a white man.
My face is sunburnt.
The color of my ass says I'm a white.
Look!
What's wrong with being an Injun?
Your dad was, your mom was white.
So what? Black, white, red.
What difference does it make?
- We're all somebody's children.
- She was white.
So white the other whores called her Ghost.
I'm not bragging.
What I told you is all I know.
I'm a lone wolf.
I don't run with the pack.
Know why they call me Steam Engine?
I got fed up with city society and jumped a train.
That's right. The man who gallops on an iron horse.
- That's far enough.
- You're at the end of the road.
- You crazy? You gonna fight?
- You're at the end of the track.
- What's happening?
- Jump!
Bill!
Bill. You all right?
Did you get hurt?
Yeah, I'm all right, Lucy.
Whoever planned this railway?
Maybe they're gonna build a bridge.
I remember when this place was nothing.
- Is this where the rails stop?
- This is the end.
Of the Western Railroad Company.
Those are all the tracks we got left.
And where's the Pacific?
- Answer me that.
- He's right. Where is it?
Listen to what I tell you.
There's no future for railroads in this country.
- Where are you going?
- To look for a new job.
The company left us high and dry and we're skedaddling.
Joe, Bill, come on.
There's still some hot coffee.
Come on, Bill.
Take it easy, Bill.
Don't go getting yourself plastered.
I don't get plastered.
I just get happy.
Come on. You call that happy?
Injuns are gloomy by nature.
Bill, a chief's son shouldn't fly off the handle like that.
Oh, yeah?
If I had a handful of men who really knew where their balls are,
I'd screw this whole goddamn country.
Loneliness.
That's what it is.
The loneliness of genius.
Open your ears, genius.
Can you do that?
I've got a proposal for you.
We could work together.
Yeah!
What a fantastic idea.
- A triad.
- Not what I had in mind.
Are you in or out?
Well, if there's a chance to snuff somebody out. Who's the guy?
- His name is Major Cabot.
- Is that the famous Indian hunter?
Someone who without a doubt deserves our complete respect.
Look here, Bill. If you can get all of $300 or a bit more together we could make a fast $300,000 out of it.
How much is that again?
The amount the major didn't give to the Injun Agency.
What do I have to do?
- You've been in the army.
- Right. Like all white men.
Rank?
Deserter.
- How'd you like to be a colonel?
- Could be nice for a change.
What do you say, Lucy?
Where you gonna get the uniform?
That's on its way but you'll need whiskers.
Whiskers?
Like these?
The guy you're standing in for has a real set.
Then I'll grow my own.
Just give me time.
All the time you want wouldn't give you whiskers.
They don't grow on Injuns.
On me they do!
Because I'm not an Indian!
- What is it?
- Shh!
Someone's coming.
A wagon or a stage...
That's what the stupid redskins do to hear far-off sounds.
In the age of the telegraph they still throw themselves on the ground.
- Coming this way?
- Who?
How do I know?
You believe you can put your ear to the ground and hear a stagecoach?
- An escort?
- It's being followed.
- How many riders? Injuns?
- Four. No, the horses are shod.
- Joe, they're shooting!
- Yeah, I know.
How the Christ can you know without your ear to the ground?
They're shooting at a colonel with a red beard.
See? When you're not an Indian you get it wrong.
Where are you? There's the coach and there's the idiot.
But where are the four riders?
Here we are, Steam Engine.
Mortimer!
What are you doing with the beads on?
It's the fashion.
But what ain't never the fashion is witnessing.
Throw down your gun.
You shouldn't have seen what you just saw.
Why? What did I just see?
You saw the colonel.
You saw us made up in beads.
Oh, you got beads on, huh?
I swear to God I never even noticed.
- In any case, you noticed us.
- Me?
No! No!
- So who the hell are you talking to?
- Myself.
I always talk to myself.
You know what prairie folk are like.
I talk and I listen.
Hoping that someone somewhere will hear and answer me.
For the sake of the old days when we worked together.
Remember?
Mortimer.
Jelly Roll will hate you for even thinking about such an idea.
Why don't you answer me?
- Let's cut it short.
- No! It's a joke.
No!
Stop!
Don't shoot.
He's my brother.
Where did you get hold of a sister like her?
Come on. Let's have a better look.
Be a good girl.
Bring up the curtains.
To save his life and make us happy you'll have to split into four.
Stop!
Don't lay a hand on my girl.
Christ! How many are you back there?
Leaving out the women and unarmed men, just me.
But I'll split into four to make you happy.
Now cool off, buster.
We only meant to have a little fun with your girl.
Why not, Joe?
Let them have a little fun.
Let's all have fun.
What's wrong with that?
Why take chances, darling?
There are too many of them.
Throw down your gun.
Throw it down, darling.
- I missed!
- Naturally. He moved.
- What do you mean, naturally?
- You can only hit sitting targets.
Throw it away.
You'd be better with a bow and arrow.
I was so scared.
- Keep it up and I'll name my price.
- Name it!
Oh, Bill!
How come you call him darling and me brother?
The true fact is
I can't make up my mind.
I don't know who I love most.
Told you.
But you had to have it your own way.
I'm... going to die.
Well, we're sorry as we can be.
- Yeah! It's real!
- Please!
Don't let me die like this.
Not knowing.
- What, Colonel?
- Why do you all keep pulling... my beard?
Didn't have time to tell him.
Soon Major Cabot will know he's dead.
- Back to square one.
- Yeah.
- He's getting the hang of it.
- Jesus! Is he moving!
He's not heading for Cabot.
He's going to Jelly Roll.
What's this Jelly Roll like?
He believes in an eye for an eye.
Well, we didn't get them all, did we?
One got away.
Yeah. But three of them are dead.
So? Everything depends on how you tell it.
He did it.
Shot them right between the eyes.
He threw me the gun, Jelly Roll.
I'd never shoot your men.
Hey, keep moving! Come on!
You caught their attention with your creamy thighs.
- I didn't force them to look.
- Pity you can't hit a moving target.
- Poor Steam Engine.
- Right. But I was wise to them.
And I got out of the way.
- You see?
- I can hit six out of six!
But you didn't know that Mortimer was... wise to you.
I didn't. Where did you go?
To my right.
Like you should have.
It's easy to hit a moving target.
Now only four of us know
Colonel Pembroke is dead.
It's good to meet a man who catches on so fast.
What are we gonna do with Mortimer?
Bury him in a Mexican cemetery.
Wise guy, huh?
- Trust him. He's with me.
- Looks like you're with him.
Let's see if we can raise the colonel from the dead.
"We're not ordinary people."
We're not ordinary people,
Major Cabot, we're Americans.
The prairies must be firmly anchored to our great country if we're to realize our ideals.
- How's that?
- It'll do.
Now the beard.
Jesus!
Oh, well. But with the proper... trousers and boots, shoulders, a little spit and polish here and there...
Well, what do you think?
- I think he's fine.
- So do I.
Then... there's no doubt about it.
They'll shoot you.
Keep saying it, Bill.
We're not ordinary people,
Major Cabot...
Not that. You said it all night.
The instructions.
Goddammit!
I'm fed up with this clown act!
Go to the fort, pass yourself off as Pembroke.
- Confiscate the $300,000. Then?
- Then?
If they haven't strung me up,
I head due east fast and meet you.
If Cabot gives me an escort, you'll stop the coach shove a gun in my neck and say "Move and I'll shoot."
- Go on.
- If there's no escort, don't do it.
We get the hell out of there and live happily ever after on a beach.
- Fine.
- Perfect. What are you so sore about?
That'll do, Michelangelo.
What am I so sore about? Look at him.
Think he'll pass for a cavalryman?
- You think you'll pass for a colonel?
- That's what I'm saying!
They won't even let us into the fort.
They'll eat us alive.
- Too bad for them. Let's go.
- Giddy up, there!
Whoa!
A wagon without a driver.
Who the hell are you talking to? Me?
A colonel in the United States Army?
Keep on croaking.
I can't understand a word you say.
If what you're saying is words.
You know what you can do with it.
Hey!
Let's have a little respect here.
- He sees beyond the mountains.
- I see right in front of my nose.
If an old redskin can see it too,
I'm screwed.
- What was that?
- The Western Railroad Company.
On its relentless march to the sea.
This is where I get off.
- Good luck, Colonel.
- The branch is too big for that Injun.
Hey, Joe.
Give old Dry Branch there a hand.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Attention!
Whoa!
Colonel.
Welcome to Fort Christabel, Colonel.
I'm Major Cabot.
- We're not ordinary people, Major...
- Later, Daddy.
This is, I presume, Miss Pembroke?
- Yes, presumably she's my daughter.
- Many a flower's born to blush unseen.
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.
Shall we go inside?
- Who did you build the gallows for?
- Oh. That Indian, sir.
A horse thief. Follow me.
This way.
I've had the best quarters in the fort prepared especially for you.
I'm astonished, Major Cabot.
Frankly, I never expected to meet up with such a polished gentleman.
- This makes it worth it.
- Compliments on the set-up.
Beneath these rough uniforms lurk hearts of purest gold.
Sergeant Milton looks like a bear but he's just a child grown too fast.
In here.
The rest of us are ordinary people.
We're not ordinary people,
Major Cabot, we're Americans.
Colonel, would you care for a cigar?
I think it's a flavor you might enjoy.
The prairies...
Yes, indeed.
Daddy, you're smoking!
Of course I'm smoking.
The prairies must be firmly anchored...
If that's anchored you'll burn to death. Take it off.
There you are.
The best quarters prepared especially for you.
And wastes its sweetness on the desert air.
I'm gonna waste your sweetness, little girl.
Let's go, Sergeant.
It's all over, Bill.
They got you by the short hairs.
- Son of a bitch!
- It was our plan.
For you to dress like a colonel.
And you did it.
What's the matter with you?
Why do you suddenly trust me?
Poor Bill baby.
That takes all the fun out of it.
Now we have to think about the third member.
He's sly so we have to think hard.
What did Jelly Roll call him?
- Joe Thanks.
- What?
- Joe Thanks.
- The names these people have.
You'd better send your men after him.
Where, sir?
Jelly Roll says you can't grab him.
He's here, he's there.
Slippery as an eel.
- Where we gonna look?
- That's your own problem, my boy.
- Just get him, will you?
- Yes, sir.
I want him in my office immediately.
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
What do you want?
An egg.
An egg this small.
Pale green and speckled brown.
You'd call it the color of buffalo shit.
A baby buzzard with a hooked beak.
He sticks out his pink-green neck then his bare big toe.
Mama buzzard, like any loving mother, swoops down with a nice, fat piece of carrion.
I know the desert sun can affect the brain.
Shh!
High above...
Papa buzzard, his wings steady, ensures nothing disturbs the little one munching on the tender, rotten meat.
Suddenly: boom!
Thunder shakes the mountain.
The rocks are burst asunder.
And the dust of death rises up, up, up into the sky.
Papa buzzard weeps in the heavens.
Weeps for his murdered mate and baby.
"Make them stop killing everything."
Who?
They're here with their dynamite.
Drilling holes in the rock and: boom!
All dead.
Papas, mamas, helpless little ones.
What's worse, it's hard for a fella to relax.
I sleep in a cave under Red Rock.
Tell them to stop.
- Get out of here.
- My mistake.
I heard you're protecting buzzards.
I am.
I feed them flesh of people who enter my office and bother me.
Now get out of here!
Stop!
Just a minute.
Did you talk to anyone else about...
Did you mention your concern for the buzzards to anyone before me?
No, I came straight here.
You did the right thing, my boy.
Guard!
This Cabot runs a lousy prison.
Not a match in the place.
He's out to break me with slow torture.
He said he'd waste my sweetness.
This'll learn you to listen to that baby-blue-eyed wise guy.
What's Joe got to do with us being here?
Jelly Roll cheated us, not Joe.
You got a noose around your neck and still you stand up for him.
- Answer me!
- No!
I'm standing up for him because he's a friend of mine.
I can count on him.
If you're still counting on him to name his price, forget it!
Because it's too late.
Say what you will.
The only thing I regret in my whole life is Joe.
Me too.
He has everything worked out.
Never makes a slip. A genius!
Know what I'd do if I had him here?
Tear off his head and eat it like this.
Go ahead but don't ruin your dentures.
Oh, Joe!
- Joe! Joe!
- Lucy!
I knew he'd get us out.
Oh, sure.
Am I making a mistake or are you also a guest here?
You couldn't be more right.
Oh, that quietens my heart.
This is a pleasure.
They'll string us up in the morning.
At least we'll swing together.
- Will we, Joe?
- The Injuns are always pessimistic.
- It's working out how we planned.
- Is it?
It's like playing pool.
The ball bounces into another ball and drives it into the hole.
Where are you going?
No power on Earth can persuade us to go forward with this railroad.
So you can save your breath.
We're going back.
We're through.
Think it's worth blowing up a mountain just to get to the Pacific?
I tell you, it's full of stones as hard as metal.
Never seen anything like it.
Milton!
This is all alluvial rock.
Those railroad men didn't see what was before their eyes.
This is quartz. Pure quartz.
Scratch it and you'll have an avalanche of nuggets.
Take a pickax and you'll find pure gold.
Like I found on that chair.
I had it tested.
Pure gold.
Gold.
I've said there's gold here for 15 years but nobody...
Nobody believed me.
Seems we've lost our horses.
You're the linguist, Sergeant.
It's all yours.
- I'll try
- Don't overdo it.
I'll trade a wide tract of grazing land with plenty of good water and buffalo in exchange for this useless piece of sand and rock.
And to show that I mean business
I'll even sign a treaty.
- What did he say?
- He'll only deal with the colonel.
The one who just came to the fort.
Not with a son of a bitch like you.
- That screws us.
- That depends.
Ask him if he ever met the colonel.
He says he knows him only by reputation.
Then tell him the colonel will be delighted to shake his hand and strike a bargain.
- But Colonel Pembroke...
- Is enjoying our fort's hospitality.
You're only hanging the two of us?
Get going.
Come on.
This way.
I think he's fine.
Just fine.
This way, Colonel.
Get moving. On the double.
- Come on.
- Colonel Pembroke, sir.
My fellow officers and I hope you'll accept our fort's humble hospitality.
Miss Pembroke, you come to us like a desert flower.
- How charming.
- Not at all, Miss Pembroke.
- I hope you won't pick my petals.
- They must be plucked, not picked.
May I accompany you to the table?
Remember when Indians surrounded us in the Black Mountains?
A bedraggled squad of cavalry trapped on a hilltop encircled by a swarm of Indians.
I was a mere lieutenant.
And you, Colonel.
Were you a major or a captain?
I was a general.
I never met a funnier man than your father.
Yes. Me neither.
Seeing there was no way out the colonel said, "Dismount.
We shall stand and die together."
It was a massacre.
Oh, you mean they got us?
- I'll get you if you bail on us.
- What should I do?
- Tomorrow you talk to an old Indian.
- About the 300,000?
- Trifles!
- What trifles?
Your father asked why I wasn't decorated for that day's deeds.
As I told him, the joy of serving my country has been satisfaction enough.
We are not ordinary people.
We are Americans.
Shit!
- No fun playing alone, is it?
- I need a queen, I got a jack.
- Turn it into a queen.
- Gone crazy or were you born that way?
Let me see it.
- What?
- Let me see it.
Jack.
Queen.
- See? Easy.
- If I could do that at a poker game!
You can do better than that.
Watch this.
Now...
One, two, three.
- Kids' stuff.
- Let me try.
I get it.
The trick is to open the cards.
The trick is to get the door open.
There it is. Yeah!
You got bad cavities.
Shut your mouth or I'll fill them.
I can shut you up and open the lock with one shot. The keys!
Halt!
Left face!
Attention!
- Where do you come from?
- El Paso.
- Don't we know each other?
- I don't think so, sir.
- I'm from a different place.
- What kind of place?
A place where men are men, sir.
I'll teach all of you what a real man is.
That's my job here.
I'm gonna hit this fella and he's gonna smile and say,
"I didn't feel it,
I'm a soldier of the 5th Cavalry."
- Let's try.
- As you wish, sir.
- Did it hurt?
- No, sir.
- Why not?
- I'm a soldier of the 5th Cavalry.
- Did it hurt?
- No, sir.
- Why not?
- I'm a soldier of the 5th Cavalry.
- Did it hurt?
- No. It wasn't my foot, it was his.
Silence!
Left... face!
To the quartermaster's store.
Forward... march!
Hey, you!
Stop!
Stop him.
I know him.
He's crazy.
Grab him!
That guy insulted our major.
- Come down here.
- No. I wanna be free.
Listen.
- Come down here.
- I'm afraid you're gonna beat me.
Go back to your cell.
- The major doesn't like escapees.
- No. I don't care about the Cavalry.
- Saw down that pole.
- Sergeant! What are you doing?
No. Stop it.
Make them stop, Sergeant.
- Make them stop, Sergeant! Sergeant!
- Are you gonna come down, then?
Yes, sir.
No. No, Sergeant.
I wanna be free like a buzzard.
- I want to be free!
- He's crazy! Saw it down.
Make them stop, Sergeant.
That's dangerous. I wanna live.
I wanna live.
No. Don't. No. No.
No!
Get him out of that wagon.
Open wide.
And now?
Now it's solitary confinement for you.
You! Bring me the keys.
- Back inside?
- Sir.
Give them a hand.
Come on.
Look at the sun, Sergeant.
Bye bye!
Shoot him down!
Shut the doors!
Stop, you fool.
That cannon's loaded.
Don't shoot, you stupid...
It's pointing at the ammunition wagon.
- What do you want?
- I forgot my hat.
If you don't mind, Sergeant.
I'm afraid I have a very bad habit.
Pass the hat round, Sergeant.
Come on.
Whatever you can afford, boys.
Put it in the hat.
Come on.
- Come on, men.
- Thanks.
Hurry up, Sergeant.
Hey, you.
My gun.
Take it to him.
- Give, men.
- Thanks. Hurry up. Not too tight.
Thanks.
Thank you.
You're doing fine, Sergeant.
Your turn now.
Thanks.
Careful with that cigar.
Don't forget, you're a soldier of the 5th Cavalry.
Whoa! Take over, Major.
- The stupid Indians are falling for it.
- Sergeant.
You let that madman get away with horses and a cannon.
Who's stupid?
Colonel.
I think we should take positions.
Don't try anything or I'll send the sergeant to the fort and he'll do awful things to your daughter.
- Yeah, you told me.
- Right.
Look happy.
You only have to sign your name.
It'd be easier if I had to kill
20 of your men with my left hand.
I can't write.
Is this the Indian?
But this old man knows me well.
He's known me since I was a kid.
- You've grown up. You have a beard.
- He sees beyond the mountains.
He's probably recognized me.
- The chief says...
- I'm not deaf.
- You can understand him? How?
- I'm a lip-reader.
- The chief says...
- I'm not deaf.
- I'm not either. What did he say?
- He's willing to sign.
If Colonel Pembroke's here to witness.
Okay, I'll watch you sign.
Let's get on with it.
- Everything all set here?
- All ready. You just need to sign.
What's he want? A little extra bonus?
A bottle of whiskey?
- You better tell him, Sergeant.
- No, you better tell him, Colonel.
The chief is satisfied with the treaty but asks why you're giving them this land full of water and buffalo for a hole in the rock full of nothing but fool's gold.
Fool's gold?
Sure, it's gold. But what the hell?
Anybody can buy gold dust.
Joe Thanks was the other partner.
The one you sent the boys looking for.
All the time he was locked up in the next room.
- I can't figure out why he did it.
- I'll tell you.
He was in cahoots with the old Indian, cheating me out of that territory.
To succeed he had to use you.
To force me to present you in public as Colonel Pembroke.
The 300,000 greenies were an excuse to get you working for him.
He just wanted the Indians to get the land back.
Indians! You're right!
That fella has a thing about Indians.
He was in cahoots with that decrepit redskin.
That's why he got me into this mess.
To screw me.
Now you're gonna screw him.
Yeah. All right.
Major, Joe may have scr... done us wrong but Bill wouldn't double-cross a friend.
- He'd prefer to hang?
- Bill has Indian blood.
Indians don't even double-cross people who double-cross them.
Indians, no. Me, yes.
I'll double-cross anyone.
- You, my ma, my pa.
- Don't let them drag you down!
If Joe did what he did, he must have had a good reason.
I got 1,000 good reasons to give him right back what I got.
Genius!
I'll show that son of a bitch!
Now you're talking like I like to hear.
- When do you want me to betray?
- The $300,000 is to be split.
All we have to do is follow your friend's plan to the letter.
But with one tiny variation.
Ah, Colonel Pembroke, sir.
I hereby consign to you $300,000 to be returned to the U.S. Government.
Colonel, may I have your signature, please?
It's time to make your mark.
Captain.
- Major.
- The escort is assembled?
- Yes, Major. Assembled and waiting.
- The coach will be leaving shortly.
The sooner it's underway, the less chance it'll get lost.
Thank you. Thank you, Colonel.
Escort!
Attention!
Will you allow me to escort you as far as Albuquerque?
- And if I don't?
- Very kind.
- May I assist you?
- Thank you.
Here's the variation I told you about.
When he holds up the coach he's not gonna get the money.
Excuse me, my dear, would you mind showing a little surprise to your papa?
He is going to... get this.
I'd like to see Joe's face.
I'd really like to see his face.
Yes. You'll see it.
You'll be there when he opens it.
Stop!
He's riding slap bang into it.
Stop!
Stop! They wanna kill...
Colonel Pembroke!
They wanna kill Colonel Pembroke!
- Not a man in black on a black horse?
- No.
I see a man in white on a white horse.
- But it comes to the same.
- It's Joe!
They wanna kill Colonel Pembroke.
They wanna kill Colonel Pembroke.
- They want Colonel Pembroke's life.
- Who? Who?
Who wants to kill me?
I do.
Major, order your men to drop their guns over there.
He's an assassin.
Do what he says.
Out of the way.
I will give that order.
Our colonel's life is at stake.
Do what this man says.
Escort! Throw down your guns.
Over there.
Escort! Follow me!
Mind handing me that box of money?
Major!
I order you to give him that box.
Very well, Colonel.
Excuse me.
Thanks.
Thanks.
I never saw a prettier army officer's daughter.
Thank you.
But please... don't hurt my father.
Then I'll take you as a hostage.
Come on, Major.
I think you're a little confused.
I'm only a major.
He's a... He's a colonel.
We got a long trip. Move!
So long, Colonel. Miss.
Hurry up!
Save the major! Get moving!
Hurry up! Everybody this way!
Come on!
And if you can't save Major Cabot, at least save the money!
What am I supposed to do now,
Colonel?
- Stay put and guard the pass.
- Yes, sir, Colonel.
Now you realize who the real genius turns out to be.
Surprised?
Your partner double-crossed you.
He and I planned this together.
Here's Jelly Roll and his boys to settle accounts.
Where's the money?
It's quite safe.
On the stagecoach.
Safe? With Steam Engine?
Don't shoot! It's Major Cabot!
He's gaining!
I found his driver's gun.
- I don't see him any longer.
- We made it!
- Are you hurt?
- No. He hit the shaft.
Give me the chest. The chest!
- What are you gonna do?
- Get off this merry-go-round.
And put the money where it's safe.
See you in St. Louis, Missouri, honey.
Joe!
Faster, damn you!
Hey! You got just what I want.
Now.
- Where's she going? Stop her.
- Hold her.
Oh, please! Please, mister.
- Now!
- Let me go. Let me go, I tell you!
Blast!
Don't. There's gonna be an explosion.
Stop it!
Stop!
There's two men down there! gone up in smoke!
Come on, you dope.
Joe! Bill!
- Bill, are you okay?
- No.
- What's the matter? You hurt?
- Yes.
- Where?
- Here.
I wanna know something right now.
- What the hell's going on?
- It's working out like we planned.
Hey!
Is this the head pay office?
Sure. This is it.
Get in line, boys.
- Come on, boys.
- There's something for everybody.
- Come on.
- Hey, mister.
Thanks for giving us the job of blasting that rock.
- I hope it suited you.
- You did a good job.
- Almost smothered us to death though.
- Beautiful piece of work, Joe.
Don't thank me.
The credit goes to my partner.
Thanks, boys.
- That's it. Thanks.
- Thank you.
There you are, Jelly Roll.
So I've been crossed but not double-crossed.
That's about it.
There are times in life when you think money's the most important thing there is.
But once you get it maybe you wish you hadn't.
- Where are you going with the money?
- Hush, now.
Remember?
A ray of the dying sun touches the mountains.
They seem bathed in blood.
The peaks throw long shadows down to the bottomless valley.
In the blue sky a hawk glides, wide and easy.
- Wings cleaving the air?
- Yeah.
Not that horse again.
Here's the money, Grandpa.
Why are they dressed like this?
Isn't that the way you wanted it?
- Goodbye, Joe.
- Why? Where are we going?
Now you know why I'm going with him.
Gonna screw America.
Bringing Grandpa too?
He stays. He represents the past.
The son of a bitch had it all figured out.
Wagon comin'!
Sound fire alarm!
Open the gates!
[Men Shouting]
Fire alarm! Fire alarm!
[Man]
On the double! Move it!
[Man]
Move it, soldiers! Fire, fire!
It's Shoshone again, sir.
- And our wagon.
- Yes, sir.
Private Higgins and Corporal Albright took it to the supply depot last week.
This belonged to Corporal Albright.
Must have hit them coming out of Sam Young Canyon.
Stripped it and put the torch to it.
- Take care of the mounts, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.
Lieutenant Ravencroft, in the last three months, the army has lost... over 40 cases of Springfield carbines.
Twice that amount
of army issue handguns,
saddles, blankets and rations.
Enough to supply two forts this size.
And all those thefts
occurred in territory under
the protection of this fort.
I realize that, sir.
I want you to mount another patrol, Lieutenant.
Take as many men as you need, the best scouts we have... and find out what happened to those supplies!
- Yes, sir.
- Jim...
I'm running out of explanations to Washington.
If these raids don't stop... it could mean... my command here.
I understand, sir.
I'll leave immediately.
Boy, I sure miss Dusty, Donovan, and the kids... and that old dinner bell ringing on the farm.
Now don't start again, Amos.
Is that how you want to go down in the history books?
"After terrorizing the West, they ended up as farmers... milkin' cows and collectin' eggs."
- Is that what you want?
- Well, no, not exactly, but... boy, Dusty sure could make those biscuits and honey.
You just stick with me.
I tell ya, Amos, people are gettin' rich in these boom towns... and there's no reason why a couple of smart hombres like us...
- can't double or even triple our stake overnight.
- Double?
We got $300.43 now.
If we double that tonight, then we triple that tomorrow night, that'd be, uh...
- that'd be... carry the one...
- Kind of gets you to thinkin', don't it?
- Six... no, four... three...
- First thing we gotta do is get ourselves spiffied up.
- Then we'll take this town like Grant took Richmond.
- That's right.
I get ya now.
How do you think we go about...
Howdy.
Say, um, how do you figure going about that?
Well, uh, I'm still workin' on the particulars.
I'll tell you one thing: We ain't gonna dry gulch no one no more.
Yeah, and you ain't gonna get us mixed up in none of those bank robberies.
- Shh.
- Shh.
You want every punk gunslinger this side of the Rio Grande callin' us out?
You mean, make a rep for himself, Theodore?
Don't even use our real names.
We don't want no trouble with the law neither.
We're goin' straight from now on, Pard.
We're gonna live by our wits.
Wits?
Whoa.
Whoa, now.
- Miss Gaskill?
- Yes.
Yes, ma'am,
I'm Private Reid.
I was assigned to escort you.
Were all the officers busy?
Well, you see, there've been some problems at the fort, ma'am... and I guess they were needed for more important duties.
It's a bit warmer than I expected.
I'd best get some lighter clothing before we leave.
You can take care of this in the meantime... and get my things from the stage.
[Braying]
Well, what do you think, Clarise?
Huh? Yeah?
What's the matter?
Don't you recognize me? It's me.
- [Braying Continues]
- Oh, that. Uh, here. Take a whiff.
That's Eau deJasmine.
Direct from "Paree".
You wanna stop talkin' to that donkey?
- It's embarrassing.
- Yeah, oh.
Say, uh, Theodore... uh, Pard...
I was wonderin', before we take this town, I wonder if we could have our picture took?
Might not be a bad idea.
Might look good in the history books.
- Come on.
- [Donkey Braying]
Can't talk to you anymore.
It's embarrassing.
[Photographer]
There.
Does this have to be this tight?
Well, the purpose of a brace is so that you'll stay absolutely still.
I thought I was gonna be crouched down, like I'm gettin' the drop on somebody.
- Will you just listen to the man, Amos?
- And stay still.
Stay absolutely still.
[People Chattering]
[Braying]
What was that?
- Just take the picture.
- All right, now both of you take a deep breath...
- [Inhaling]
- And hold it.
One, two...
[Braying]
- Whoa!
- Don't let him near my equipment!
Amos, stop her!
Oh, my beautiful things!
Get me out of this!
Get me out of this!
You're going to pay for it.
I'll make you pay for it.
- You're making a shambles of my studio!
- Right. Gotta pay for this.
You're going to pay
for every cent of this,
or I'll have the law on you.
Oh, dear.
And bring back my headrests.
Theyjust came from St. Louis.
We only been in this town three hours... and already we got $70 less than we come here with... thanks to you and that dumb donkey of yours.
Yeah, don't worry. I got her tied up in some alley. She won't give us no more trouble.
Well, why didn't you just stop her before she busted up the whole place?
Because the guy taking the picture said, "Take a deep breath and hold it."
- Now how am I supposed to...
- Did you have to tell the man we're the Apple Dumpling Gang?
- Apple Dumpling Gang!
- Well, you're the one who said not to use our real names.
All right. From now on, just let me do all the talking, okay?
Then we won't get in these messes.
- Right. Okay, Theodore, uh, Pard.
- [Glass Breaking]
[All Shouting]
[Belches]
Why, you rotten...
Why, you filthy little...
[Grunts]
I don't tolerate hooligans and rowdies.
And any cowboy...
who tries to hooraw this town... will not live to regret it.
[Giggling]
Ladies.
[Boy]
Marshal Hitchcock, sir?
He's so handsome!
[Murmuring, Giggling]
- Who is that?
- Who's that?
Only Woolly Bill Hitchcock, the fastest-shootin', toughest marshal in the country.
You cross horns with him, he'll track you to your grave.
What do you think?
Oh, we got nothin' to worry about.
We're law-abidin' citizens now.
Matter of fact, first thing we're gonna do is open a bank account.
Now, is that different than openin' a safe?
- Come on.
- Probably.
Well, looks solid enough.
Couple of pilgrims out front.
- Well, take what we got and let's get out of here.
- In a minute.
I never made money so fast in my life.
They're comin' in.
All right, don't get walleyed.
You'll smoke out Woolly Bill.
Close the door.
Come on!
[Man]
Help you gentlemen?
Yes. We'd like to make one of them, uh... deposits.
How much you want to donate...
deposit?
The whole kit and caboodle: $230.
- That much, huh?
- And, uh... we want a "recipe" for that.
You're nobody's fool.
I can see that.
Any time you gentlemen want
your money back, you just... bring in this slip, and it'll be cheerfully refunded...
- with interest.
- [All Laughing]
We're on our way now, Pard.
[Man] Come on, Wes. Let's get
that money transferred.
Howdy.
- Howdy.
- Our president. A real go-getter.
- Give me a hand, Wes.
- You grab those two.
[Grunting]
Pleasure doin' business with you gentlemen.
[Amos]
Thank you.
Wh-Where are you going with the money?
Don't like to keep too much cash in one place.
Just not good business.
[Man]
I told you you was tryin'
to take too much.
These horses got all they can carry.
Put the rest on that jackass and let's get outta here.
You know somethin'?
They forgot to stamp the date on there.
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll get that.
[Woman]
Help! Help! Help!
They're robbin' the bank!
The bank's been robbed!
Oh, blow it out your ear, sheep lover!
[Gunfire]
Look out!
[Screams]
[Screaming Continues]
Look what you've done!
What do you mean? If it hadn't been for me, you'd have been trampled by those horses.
A train would have been preferable to you!
Now get off of me!
- Well, let me give you a hand.
- [Screams]
- Let me get your bags.
- No!
Doesn't anybody understand what I'm trying to tell ya?
- The bank has been...
- Calm down, woman.
While you have been wearing out your mirror, the bank's been robbed.
They went thataway, stupid!
Amos, we have been taken.
They stole every red cent in this bank, includin' ours.
I'm gonna go report this to that
Marshal What's-His-Name. Come on.
[Grunts]
- Marshal, you're just the man we were looking for.
- Hold it right there.
- Yeah, b-but there were two men in here, and they th...
- All right, now.
Just turn around, remove your guns... and drop them...
- Huh?
- Nice and easy.
Want to show him this?
I said drop them.
[Bullets Ricocheting]
Ooh! Ow!
Marshal, I'm sorry.
We didn't...
Well, I'll be dipped.
They got Woolly Bill.
They outgunned
Woolly Bill Hitchcock!
[Laughing]
- Let's get outta here.
- [Laughing Continues]
It's a sight for sore eyes!
[Laughing]
Boy, if anybody sees us in these fancy duds, we're goners for sure.
You know, I knowed we never should have throwed away our clothes.
It was good for another three years.
Oh, here's your shirt.
Somebody throwed noodles in it.
[Crowd Murmuring]
Well, how'd they do it, Woolly?
- They must've snuck up behind ya.
- Let's get you over to Doc Sykes.
[Laughing]
I knew it would happen!
I just knew it!
They finally did it.
They got Woolly Bill!
- Two dudes did it. I saw it myself.
- Uh, did you hear that?
- Two dudes.
- Uh, probably from back East.
Woolly had the drop on 'em, and they still outgunned him.
They's faster than...
They's faster than scalded cats, them two.
And I ain't crazy neither.
I saw it myself.
Yeah, uh, you actually saw these two guys, is that right?
Well, I got to get over to The Clarion... and give my eyewitness report.
[Grunts]
[Laughing]
They did it!
They did it!
[Laughing Continues]
You know, since we went straight, we're in more trouble than we ever was.
- Can't we go back to terrorizing the West?
- We can't go anywhere, stupid.
We don't have money for train fare... and we can't ride that dumb donkey of yours,
'cause you can't find her.
Come on. Get dressed.
[Crowd Gasping]
They call theirselves the Apple Dumpling Gang.
- They what?
- Well, that's what they said, Mr. Hitchcock.
The Apple Dumpling Gang.
They's the same two that outgunned ya, Woolly.
[Hitchcock]
Yes, I see them.
I saw 'em myself, right after they shot the guns out of your hands.
Hard to believe, ain't it?
Did you really have the drop on 'em, Mr. Hitchcock?
He sure did. And that's the donkey the others lit out with.
Why, the gang must have split up.
Those are the two I want.
I'll keep this, if you don't mind.
Oh, of course, Mr. Hitchcock.
Glad to help...
anyway that I can.
- Our picture's never gonna get in the history books now.
- Oh, yes it will.
We'll go down as numbers 16 and 17 shot by Marshal Woolly Bill Hitchcock.
- Let's get out of here.
- Huh?
[Theodore]
You know, Amos...
we pulled a real slick one
on that Mr. Hitchcock feller.
He's gonna be ridin' all over the country lookin' for two dudes with checkered vests...
not a couple
ofhard cases like us.
I'd say we got it pretty soft.
Even be better if we had something to eat.
Don't worry about that right now.
We just lay low in this old barn till dark... then we just slip out of town and mosey off to other parts.
Ain't no way we're gonna be tied up with that bank robbery.
[Braying]
- [Theodore]
Clarise?
- Clarise!
Now, wait.
Don't be mean to her.
That's our way out of town.
Listen, people seen her hightail it out with that bank money.
Now she comes follerin'you
around like a hungry pup.
It ain't gonna take Woolly Bill long to put two and two together.
- Who's the other two?
- You and me and two ropes, that's who.
We gotta get rid of your mule and ditch that bank money.
- I thought you said we was goin' straight.
- Hush up. Let me think.
- Hey, Pard.
- Huh?
Is this how you make a capital T?
What are you doin'?
- What's the capital T for?
- Theodore.
Don't put my name on it, ya strawhead.
Just say, "Here's your money back, and we're sorry we caused you any inconvenience."
All right. Okay, that's, uh, in... uh, incon...
Inconve... Inconven...
Uh, could I just say,
"No hard feelings"?
- Just forget that for now and help me with this. Come on.
- Right.
[Grunting]
- You sure this is gonna work?
- You bet it's gonna work.
I got this figured out real scientific-like.
Now, when I count to three, we drop the bags, they swing right through the bank door... and Woolly Bill's got his money back.
- That's as easy as fallin' off a log.
- Don't say that.
You ready?
One, two...
- Oh, I forgot the note.
- Three-ee-ee.
- [Theodore Screaming]
- Where ya goin'?
[Screaming Continues]
[Belches]
- [Screaming]
- I'll get ya. I got... Hey!
- [Screaming]
- Watch the window!
[Screaming]
- Give me your hand.
Give me your other hand.
- Hold me!
- Come on.
- Hold me, Amos, hold me.
Whoa!
[Groaning]
- [Man] Looks like his neck.
- [Man #2] Hey, Marshal,
let me help you here.
Don't touch me.
[Groaning]
He looks like he's plumb hurt.
- [Muttering]
- Better get a doctor.
- [Grunting]
- I gotcha.
He got the money back, just like you said he would.
- Yeah. Let's get out of here.
- Huh? Yeah.
- We're with you, Woolly.
- [Groaning]
[Grunts]
Thank you.
Yes, sir. We gotta believe in this man.
- Get back.
- I don't see Clarise nowhere.
Will you forget about that donkey?
We gotta put some distance between us and this town... or it's gonna be our permanent residence.
And I mean permanent.
Follow me.
[Crowd Murmuring]
[Woman]
I just hope he doesn't go
into one ofhis long speeches.
Here's your rifle,
Mr. Hitchcock.
He's some kind of lawman, ain't he?
[Man]
He's the man. He's the man
that's gonna get 'em.
You can do it.
- Will you kindly assist me?
- Gladly.
[Crowd Murmuring]
[Groaning]
All right.
Easy does it.
- Watch your step.
- [Groaning]
[Man]
Just look at him.
- That's a fine figure of a man.
- Here, here.
Because those two cringin'...
pusillanimous polecats... returned some money... they shall not escape my vengeance.
Be assured, good citizens ofJunction City...
I will not rest until... the Apple Dumpling Gang... is completely destroyed... and removed from society.
- [Cheering]
- May I have my trusty steed, young man... if you don't mind?
Thank you.
That will do just fine, I believe.
Here we go.
[Groans]
[Man]
Watch out, there. Stand back.
[Man #2]
Give him some room.
That's it. Listen, listen.
I shall have their carcasses...
back in this town
in two weeks.
- Two weeks.
- [Crowd Applauding]
You can come out now,
Miss Gaskill.
- Are you quite ready now?
- Oh, yes, ma'am. That was the last case of champagne.
It's about time. I'll have you know I'm not in the habit of bein' kept waitin', Private.
- Well, after all, it is for your party.
- Especially in this condition.
And furthermore,
in the future, Private...
I will expect an officer to accompany me, and not an enlisted man.
And you can rest assured...
[Dialogue Fades]
For heaven's sake!
[Groaning]
Are you certain
you're takin'the right road?
I've ridden all over, and
I've never experienced anything
that compares with this.
[Groaning Continues]
Oh, is this the first time you've traveled this road?
Why, you rarely miss a rut.
Well, just shift in the saddle, so to speak. It only hurts half as bad.
As soon as we get to Fort Concho, my father's gonna hear all about this.
Well, if this comes to a court-martial... they might demand to see evidence of your complaint.
You forget your place, soldier.
- Giddyup, now. Ho!
- Merciful heavens.
Believe me, I fully intend
to give a detailed account
of your incompetence and your...
Uh-huh. Yes.
Appears we're on the same trail, my dear.
With your permission...
I'll just let you lead the way, hmm?
Whoa, now. Whoa.
And here we are.
Allow me.
- Millie!
- Oh, Dad!
- What's all this?
- You all right, darlin'?
- Daddy, you wouldn't believe what I've been through.
- What happened, Millie?
- Oh, Jim...
- Well, come on in and tell me all about it.
I'll be right with you, Millie.
I'll just get the bags.
Sergeant Slaughter?
- Yes, sir.
- Come here.
[Both Snoring]
- What is that?
- I don't know, sir.
Where did they come from, Reid?
I have no idea, Sergeant.
- Well, get 'em out of there.
On their feet.
- Yes, sir.
We're moving.
We're moving.
Now, who in blazes are you, and how did you get in an army conveyance?
Don't answer that.
I'll do all the talking here, Amos.
And besides, who wants to know?
I want to know!
You obviously don't know who you're talking to, Little Boy Blue.
I like that.
Where is your horn, Little Boy Blue?
[Chuckles]
- Get some coffee in them, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
At ease.
Now, gentlemen, come with me to the orderly room... and I'll explain the benefits of military life to you.
Free food, outdoor activity
in the fresh air...
the camaraderie
of soldiering... and that great feeling of belonging.
Now, gentlemen, come with me and I'll help you... with the little details of joining our group.
Now you're talkin', soldier boy.
After that, we'll take care of another little detail.
[Jim]
Hey, you, trapper... what do you got here?
I found him up there just this side of timberline.
Just like this.
It's Flint and Quinn, sir.
Yeah, I been hearin' that... military is payin' thirty dollars a head for deserters, dead or alive...
- so I put in for...
- Thanks for bringing them in... but that's all you get.
These two were killed on duty.
- Take care of them, Corporal, and bring those arrows to me.
- Yes, sir.
Just thanks?
That's all I get?
By gollies, l-l-I fetched them
a long ways.
Seems like you oughta... do... somethin' for somebody.
Gets so you can't hardly...
trust nobody no more.
Come on, boy. Let's go.
And you're certain
they're Shoshone.
Well, it could be Paiute, sir, but they're not usually this far west.
Then why can't we find any sign of them?
Where did they get to?
- What was in the wagon?
- Blankets, rifles, sidearms.
Well, that'll be sold to renegades.
- Put 'em with the other evidence.
- Yes, sir.
Jim.
I don't know what
I'm gonna tell Washington.
Uh, yes, sir.
[Horse Whinnies]
Halt. Who's there?
Identify.
Halt!
Corporal of the guard!
Corporal of the guard!
We got a deserter!
Check back there.
Secure the gates!
Who is it?
I don't know, sir.
- Check the stables and sound assembly immediately.
- Yes, sir.
There he is!
What are you doing with these?
When you've been bucked and gagged for a few days... you'll feel more communicative, soldier.
Put him in the guardhouse.
Double the guard.
Company ready for inspection, Corporal?
- Ready for inspection, Sergeant.
- I'll conduct the inspection.
[Snoring]
- Is this company ready for inspection, Corporal?
- Sorry, Sergeant.
[Snoring Continues]
Did 'ems have a nice nap?
Because we don't want our new recruits to be cranky all day, do we?
- No, sir.
- When the corporal ordered inspection arms... he meant everybody.
Everybody!
Yes, sir. Yes, uh...
Oh, uh...
I'll just...
The order was for inspection of arms, soldier!
- Ooh!
- Sergeant!
Get... Get back in ranks!
Corporal, put these men on a trash detail for one month.
Now you listen to me.
For the next ten years, you are mine.
Do you understand?
Mine!
And I'm going to make soldiers out of you if I have to kill you in the process.
Corporal, take over.
I didn't have a very good night's sleep.
For talking in ranks, one month on the wood detail!
He didn't know about that rule, sir.
One month on the stable detail for both of you!
And report to me after this formation.
- Actually, it was his fault.
- And one month on kitchen police in the officers' mess!
[Violins]
You outdid yourself,
Ravencroft.
Yes, it's going to be quite an evening, isn't it? I want everything to go perfectly.
You do plan to announce your engagement this evening.
- I certainly do. I only hope that everything goes...
- Oh, there she is now.
Excuse me.
[Man]
You two.
[Knocking]
You two.
Give me a hand?
Take this in there, put it in the center of the table... and be careful.
Careful! Don't wiggle.
Don't spill it!
Be careful, you guys.
[Banjo]
Cake.
You're spilling it.
[Braying]
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
Just officers and their friends.
I am an officer.
I'm a peace officer, and I'm looking for the Apple Dumpling Gang.
- And there they are.
- [Braying]
Hands up.
[Growling]
- How'd he ever find us here?
- Your mule, that's how.
Restrain that man!
[Gaskill]
Hold him, Corporal.
We're never gonna make corporal now.
We ain't even gonna make roll call.
I tracked 'em!
They're mine! Mine!
Get the fire brigade!
- [Men Shouting]
- Let's get out of here.
[Screaming]
Ooh!
What's going on here?
Oh, I might have known it.
Get some water and put out this fire!
- Over there!
- Water! Water. Oh.
[Shouting Continues]
[Bell Ringing]
You two!
Get the powder out of that shed
before the magazine goes up!
Corporal, get a bucket brigade started.
Fast.
Fire brigade, let's go!
Move it!
- Where are we supposed to put this?
- The man said get it out.
Hey, can you see what's burnin'?
I, uh, can't see... but, uh, it sounds like the whole fort's stirred up.
Yeah, well I'm gonna see what's happenin'.
Come on!
Get the water up there!
Come on.
Get those buckets in.
[Slaughter]
Come on, come on. Hurry.
[Slaughter]
Keep 'em comin'.
Pardon me.
Gimme that bucket.
[Screaming]
Get him outta there.
Get dirt on that fire!
Keep them buckets movin', movin', or we're gonna lose the mess hall!
Get the civilians out of the fort.
Open the gates!
Amos!
- There's no water over here!
- There's plenty over here, Theodore.
L-I could do that.
[Slaughter] Corporal, never mind that.
Bring your squad over here!
Hurry, hurry.
- [Theodore] Amos!
- Huh? Don't worry, I got her.
Amos!
Clear the area!
Get out of here!
Come on!
[Hitchcock Screaming]
[Maniacal Laughter]
Come on, Amos!
Come back, boys.
[Laughing]
Come here, boys.
[Gaskill]
Careful! Careful out there!
[Slaughter]
Come on, come on. Move it!
Hey, hey!
Get me out of here!
Get me out ofhere!
- Come on, hurry up!
- All right, all right.
Okay, soldier, grab a bucket.
- Yes, sir.
- Follow me. We need all
the help we can get.
Yes, sir.
Jim, get Millie out of the compound. This whole fort's gonna go. Stay with her!
Hyah, hyah!
Hyah! Move 'em!
Hyah!
[Millie Screaming]
Hyah! Hyah!
[Shouting Continues]
Theodore?
Theodore.
Better get that punch bowl back on the table.
That cook's gonna get mad.
[Bugle]
With your permission,
I'd like to take out a squad to look for Millie.
I'm sure Private Reid took her hostage.
We have four patrols out already, Lieutenant... and we are presently reduced to a skeletal force... that couldn't defend these shambles against a stiff breeze!
Through the years, this proud fort...
Fort Concho, has withstood seven Indian assaults... four sieges, plague... drought, the blizzard of'68... and an outbreak of acute dysentery.
- We weathered them all, Lieutenant...
- Yes, sir.
Never once dipping our colors.
Then, in less than four hours... two of our own men... those two...
brought Fort Concho
to its knees.
Even if I could explain to Washington what happened... they'd never understand.
I know those people back there.
Yes, sir. Um, why don't you try to lie down, Major?
Because my quarters are destroyed!
I have no bed to lie on.
Corporal, tell these two men...
that they're gonna
hang there in the sun
for the next three days...
with just enough water
to keep them barely alive!
Then they're gonna be cut down, and they're gonna rebuild this fort... piece by piece, log by log... even if it takes the rest of their lives!
You two men are gonna hang there in the sun for three days...
I think we heard him, Corporal.
[Groaning]
Say, Theodore, how long you think it's gonna take us to rebuild this fort?
Well...
[Growling]
I don't think we're gonna have to worry about that.
- Mornin', Mr. Hitchcock.
- We was just hopin' we'd run into you, Mr. Hitchcock.
It-It's about that, uh... you know, back there in Junction City...
For bank robbery...
[Neck Muscles Crack, Groans]
For destruction of private property...
for creating
a public nuisance... for interference with an officer in the performance of his duty...
for illegal flight
to avoid prosecution...
I didn't know we did all those things. You, Theodore?
And miscellaneous
misdemeanors...
I am going to put you out of your misery... and take you back toJunction City...
draped over the back
of your own mule.
Don't we get to stand trial?
You forfeited the right to your trial... when you made me follow your jackass all over the countryside.
Mr. Hitchcock has a point there,
Theodore. We did put this man through an awful lot of trouble.
Will you just shut up.
Now, we got a fort to build here, Mr. Hitchcock. But just as soon as we're finished here... we'll meet you back at
Junction City, and then you can put us out of our misery then.
Save your breath.
You are both going to be shot between the eyes.
I won't make it any easier on you... but I will make it... somewhat of a challenge for myself.
You oughta get some butter on those hands.
[Grunting]
[Gun Firing]
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Let me go! Let me go!
You're interfering with a police officer in the performance of his duty!
They're not gonna get off that easy.
They're mine for the next ten years. Do you hear me?
Mine! Mine!
Corporal of the guard!
[Millie]
But why did you kidnap me?
[Reid] Darlin', you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
It was not for your company,
I assure you.
Do you think you can elude the entire garrison?
I am gonna try.
You do seem awfully familiar with the back trails around here.
Most of'em.
I have to be.
You're involved with these military thefts, aren't you?
That should be pretty obvious by now.
You'll be shot when they catch ya.
Well, that's the chance you take in this business. Giddyup!
Hello, in the cabin.
Hello!
Whoa.
Hello, Jeff.
Howdy, Martha.
Excuse me.
- Allow me.
- I can get down myself, thank you.
Who's that with you, Jeff?
Miss Gaskill, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine,
Mrs. Martha Austin.
Well, I'm not his friend.
I'm his prisoner, and I plead to you as another woman to help me.
Lot of women wouldn't be all that upset over your predicament. Come on in.
Leave the flowers, Jeff.
There's more.
How 'bout you,
Miss Gaskill?
No, thank you.
I'm thoroughly exhausted.
- I'd like to lay down if I may.
- Of course.
Just as soon as you finish the dishes,
Miss Gaskill.
You want to wash or dry?
And in the morning...
we'll see about rebuilding
that woodpile, Martha.
Excuse me.
Now, how much more of this do we have to stack?
Well, Miss Gaskill, you're just gettin' off to a good start.
Uh, Miss Gaskill,
let me, uh...
Let me save you some steps there.
Here ya go.
Put your arms out. Good.
Hold on, hold on.
- What do you mean, "Hold on"?
- Here we go.
- That's enough.
- Just one more. One more. There we go.
There. Lieutenant Ravencroft would be very proud of you.
Oh, I swear, when they find us, you're gonna get what's comin' to you.
Well, in that case, we better hurry up and get this wood chopped. Come on. Off you go.
- I can't!
- Whoa!
- Are you all right, Millie?
- Would you get your hands off me?
It seems that I'm all that's between you and a very nasty fall...
- and you should be thankin' me.
- Please?
Well, I didn't know that army brats knew that word.
[Screams]
There you go.
[Major]
Prisoners, front and center, ho!
A court-martial has found you guilty of... more charges than I care to enumerate at this time...
- but enough to commit you to Bridger Military Prison...
- Oh, they're mine.
All mine. Oh, yes, you see,
I caught them, and so, they're mine.
There's nothing to worry about.
I have everything under complete control.
They're mine! Mine, all mine!
[Screams]
[Screaming Continues]
Whatever's fair.
We don't want to cause any trouble.
To Bridger Military Prison, where you will remain at hard labor for 30 years.
I regret that is the maximum
penalty the law allows.
I want to add... that I am being relieved of my position here.
Two weeks from today,
Lt. Ravencroft will be promoted...
and will assume
command of the post.
- Congratulations, sir.
- Mmm-mmm.
I can say without reservation... that I have... you to thank for it!
Sergeant, Corporal.
[Horse Neighing]
- Take them away.
- [Soldier] Move.
[Hitchcock Laughing Maniacally]
I'll be waiting for you!
If it takes a hundred years,
I'll get you!
I'm going to get you!
[Crazed Laughing]
- Move 'em out!
- [Soldier] Detail, move.
[Hitchcock's Laughter Continues]
My, how you manage by yourself I'll never know.
Don't you get lonesome way out here?
The Norwoods live upstream a ways.
They look in on me once in awhile.
But I don't miss anything.
I've lived my life, and it's been a good one.
Martha, where did you ever meet Private Reid?
Jeff? I didn't even know he was in the army.
I just know he's a good man.
A good man! Why...
Why, he's an arrogant scoundrel and a disgrace to his country!
Oh, I don't know. I do know he has a much higher opinion of you.
Oh, really.
He loves you.
Loves?
Loves me?
Oh, now whatever gave you that idea?
I can hear it every time he speaks to you.
Every time he says,
"Miss Gaskill."
It's filled with love.
You're a lucky girl.
[Horse Approaching]
- Captain Phillips.
- [Phillips] Lieutenant.
- Seen any patrols?
- No, sir.
Not a sign.
Good to see you.
[Chuckles]
I got something for ya.
Colonel Stevenson, who hopes you're well.
And that I've got something definite to report on these army supply thefts, I'm sure.
Well, there was some mention of that, yes.
You know, I haven't got one solid clue yet, Lieutenant... but all indications are that the answer is somewhere inside Fort Concho.
Right now I need some more help
from you and Colonel Stevenson.
First thing, I'd like to get some new I.D. Papers... a little bit more cash...
Oh, hi, Martha.
It's me.
- She's gone.
- What do you mean? Where is she?
I didn't think she'd have the salt to try it on her own, but she did.
- Martha, she...
- She'll be all right, Jeff.
If she sticks to the stream, she'll come upon the Norwood place.
They'll give her a hand back to the fort.
[Sighs]
And Lt. Ravencroft?
I'm sorry, Jeff.
I truly am.
Hey, they're here.
They sure ain't taking any chances with them guys.
Wonder how fast they really are.
I don't want to be the one to find out.
Everybody sure has been nice to us, Theodore.
The guy who gave us these uniforms, wanted to make sure they fit. Even called us "sir."
That's because they think we're the fastest guns in the West.
- Well, we did get Woolly Bill.
- On the first bounce.
If it ever gets out what really happened in that bank, we won't last a week in here.
- What are you gonna do?
- First, we gotta find out who's really running things here.
- Once we back him down, we got no more problems. You got me?
- Right.
[Unlocking Door]
[Prisoners Chattering]
Psst.
Remember who we're supposed to be.
- [Shuddering]
- All right.
Who's the number one cock-a-doodle-doo around here?
- W-What?
- "What?"
[Grunts]
- Now, who is he?
- It's-It's Mac! It's Mac!
- Mac who?
- Uh, I don't know.
They just call him "Big Mac."
Where is this
Big Mac?
I don't know.
[Panting]
Not many of these fellas have ever seen him.
Big Mac don't, don't never come out here in the yard, n-never.
Well, you get word to this, uh, Big Mac... that the Apple Dumpling Gang wants to see him.
Okay?
Uh-h-h,
Apple Dumpling Gang.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[Straining]
- Move out.
- Y-Yes, sir.
- Move it!
- [Gasps] Yes, sir!
[Man]
One, two, three. Heave!
[Bugle]
Sometimes I wished we'd left
Marshal Hitchcock to his own devices.
- How's he doing?
- He's been released from the infirmary.
Not all together cured,
I'd say, but better.
About the robberies, Jim,
I hate to pass on unfinished business... but I did everything
I knew how.
You did everything humanly possible.
But it wasn't enough.
They stole another cavy of horses just two days ago.
- I'm beginning to think these raids are done by ghosts.
- It's uncanny, sir.
Well, it's off my shoulders now.
Daddy, it's unfair.
Nothing is fair in this world, Millie.
I'm sorry about your wedding plans, but you could hardly stay here under these conditions.
Now you know I'll be all right.
You don't have to worry about me.
We'll be married just as soon as I take my leave, sir.
Hey, Theodore, when we get out of here in 30 years, are we gonna go straight again?
I'll think about that when the time comes.
Listen, did that guard say to go left or right when we passed them boilers?
He said to go right.
This is a strange place for a shipping room.
I don't think we're supposed to be down here. We must've made a wrong turn somewhere.
Uh, where...
- [Gasping]
- Uh, Theodore?
- Theodore, what did you do?
- [Men Chattering]
- Shh.
- [Man] It'll be a week
or so till we get the cash.
- We'll make the split then.
- You did a goodjob. No witnesses.
- That's the way I want it.
- [Whispers] Amos.
You boys have had it pretty easy up till now.
But I wanna tell you,
holdin'up a train isn't easy
as them wagons.
There'll be plenty of guards around that payroll.
We'll take care of the guards.
Reno, you're in charge.
Blainey, go along with him, make sure there ain't no mistakes.
Now I'll be waiting in the meadow at the Cuddy Grade.
You work your way up to the baggage cart, throw the money out there.
Stay on the train till you
get to Oakdale, then get off.
If everything goes well,
I figure we should be able to meet back here in 45 minutes.
An hour, at the outside.
$50,000 an hour.
That's pretty good pay.
[Gasps]
Uh, could you direct us to the
Bridger Military Prison, please?
Who the blazes are you?
Ya ever hear of the
Apple Dumpling Gang, punk?
Why didn't you say so?
I hear you wanna see me.
Maybe we do, maybe we don't.
Whose little boy are you?
[Chuckling]
I'm Mac.
Mac who, fuzzy face?
That Mac.
Probably wants to talk to you.
Uh, we just wanted to say howdy.
Howdy.
How long were you there and what'd you hear?
Oh, nothing.
We just got here, Mr. Mac.
We didn't hear nothing about any train robbery, did we?
No, no. Didn't hear nothing about the money either.
- Boys.
- Wait a minute.
Mac, we can use a couple of extra guns on this job.
Yeah, I hear you boys are pretty handy with the iron.
That's right. Pound for pound, we're the best in the West.
[Big Mac]
Well, good.
Yes. [Chuckling] Well, here.
We'll give you a chance to prove it.
[Chuckling]
Well, now that's what I call shootin'.
Maybe we can use you boys.
Uh, are you gentlemen prisoners here?
When we feel like it.
It ain't all that surprisin'
when you know the story.
See, Bridger here was built by army prisoners.
When they was digging the foundation, they found these caverns.
[Chuckling]
A few of the boys just kept it under their hat.
Figured they'd use it later to bust out.
[Chuckles]
But it turned out to be the perfect hideout.
Now, where's the last place the law would look for a person that was robbin' a supply wagon?
Why, that's a toughie.
Now, where is the last place...
- Prison.
- Huh?
You got a head on you, boy.
Just barely.
So we figured why bust out and be on the dodge the rest of our lives.
Stay in prison and run the whole operation from here. Live like kings.
Come and go when we want.
Feel the need for a little relaxation, a little female companionship... we just ride into town.
Makes life in prison very comfortable.
Does Warden Waddell know about this?
No! Nobody does, but the seven of us.
Well, nine of us now and the outside man.
- Who's that?
- You'll meet him when the time comes.
The outside man lets us know when there's a wagon... or a shipment coming through with somethin' worthwhile on it.
He gets a cut
for his trouble.
You'll get yours too
if you handle yourselves
all right.
We'll be watching ya.
[Chuckles]
We'll slip into town one or two at a time.
- You two know where your spot is?
- The Variety Saloon.
I want everyone in place at 12:00 sharp.
And you better be there.
Don't worry.
Giddap!
Come on!
You know, Theodore.
Robbin' army payroll ain't exactly goin' straight.
We ain't robbed no payroll yet, Amos, and we ain't goin' to.
I'm thinkin' on a plan.
Better come up with it by noon.
If you don't have it by noon...
Wait for me.
All we gotta do is have the sheriff in this town...
Iock us up under protective custody.
Then we just lay back and let him handle the rest. We'll be heroes.
If you're looking for Sheriff Vaughn, he's over at the Widow Bradshaw's.
Seems a fox has been gettin'
into her chicken house again.
Hmm! Usually takes the sheriff about a week to settle the matter.
- A week?
- Yeah, we can't... A week?
We can't wait a week.
I mean, already the little hand's on 12, big hand's on 11.
You need a lawman, the federal marshal's
down at the Variety's.
- Let's go! Come on!
- Hey, Theodore.
Are we in more trouble here or back in Junction City?
When you're in this much trouble, it can't get worse.
[Clears Throat] Howdy.
Uh, we're lookin' for the marshal.
We've got a marshal here, of sorts.
But I don't know as he can handle your complaint though.
- I'm sure he can.
- Oh, sure he can. Where is he?
Right over there.
- [Groaning]
- It's the famous Marshal
Woolly Bill Hitchcock.
He's just a shell of a man he was before the Apple Dumpling Gang got away from him.
- Shall I wake him up?
- [Both] Uh, no, no.
- Let him sleep. We're just leaving.
- Thank you very much.
- Where's the backdoor?
- In the back.
Amos!
[Screams]
It's noon.
Whiskey.
Where's the two new gunslingers?
They'll be here.
They better.
Where we goin'?
I can't see.
I don't know.
Just act nonchalant.
- Hey, look, a couple of girls.
- [Men Whistling]
[Both Stammering]
[Man] Come down here, girls.
Let's dance!
- Remember them?
- The bank robbers?
- [Man] Play a tune, Charlie.
Maybe they'll dance.
- Big Mac.
[Piano, Cancan]
Woolly Bill.
- They're all here.
- Hey, come on!
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna dance. Come on.
[Men Cheering, Whooping]
- How long do we have to keep this up, Theodore?
- I don't know.
- Come on. Let's dance.
- [Gasps]
Hey, play something we can dance to.
[Moans]
Whoops.
["My Darling Clementine"]
Come on, honey.
Don't play hard to get.
- You're for me. I like mine with a little meat on 'em.
- [Mock Laughter]
Ain't we seen you two gals somewhere before?
- [Falsetto Voice]
We do get around.
- Ah.
Been a long time since I had my arms around a little hug and squeeze like you.
[Falsetto Voice]
I bet you say that to all the girls.
- [Mock Laughter]
- [Man Laughing]
Nah.
We gotta get out of here or we're in big trouble.
Oh, I don't know.
Mine's a pretty good dancer.
It's gettin' late.
Yeah.
We better get out of here.
If I ever get my hands on those two, I'll kill 'em.
You know, I can't get over the feelin' that I've seen you somewheres afore.
Oh, I'm just another pretty face.
[Chuckles]
Listen, gorgeous.
Why don't we get out of here?
- I'd sure like to get to know you a little bit better.
- [Mock Laughter]
[Coughing]
[Braying]
Hey, Teresa.
Look, it's Clarise.
- [Gasps]
- Uh, Teresa, Clarise is back.
- Let's get out ofhere!
- [Grunts]
Thanks for the dance, honey.
- Come on!
- Come on, Clarise.
- Theodore!
- [Moaning]
[Gasps]
[Chuckles]
[Theodore]
Amos. Amos.
[Screaming]
- You okay, Theodore?
- You bet, Pard. Thanks.
Get me down!
Get me down from here.
Let's get outta here!
- Wait a minute, Theodore.
Where's Clarise?
- Amos, forget about her!
- Clarise!
- Amos, come on!
Come on, Clarise.
Amos! Come on, Amos!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on, you two!
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?
Well, I still feel funny about Clarise, Theodore.
Will you forget about that!
A deal's a deal.
At least we're puttin' some miles between us and Big Mac.
You got a point there. I guess we can kind of relax and just sit...
- [Gasps] Hey! Isn't that, uh...
- [Gasps]
That's Reno and Blainey
and the whole bunch of'em.
They're comin'right at us.
Duck!
- Let's get on board.
- Now, move it, you guys.
We ain't got much time.
[Conductor]
All aboard!
They're comin' in here.
- Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
- That army payroll.
- It's on this train!
- Let's get outta here!
- [Train Starts Moving]
- [Both Scream]
[Grunts]
[Gasps]
You!
We can't go on meeting like this, Miss Gaskill.
Or is it Mrs. Ravencroft?
Well, there's been a slight delay in our plans.
Wonderful.
- What are you doin'?
- Just something I've wanted to do for a long time.
My, if you would've put the same amount of effort into somethin' worthwhile, why...
Get back to your seat and stay there.
Who are you to be telling me what to do?
I am Captain Jeff Phillips of Army Intelligence... and I'm on special duty here trying to find out who's behind these...
- military supply robberies at your father's fort.
- Captain?
We'll have time to talk about it later.
There's a large army payroll on this train.
I have reason to believe they're gonna try and get it.
- I don't want you shot before we get married.
- Married?
Now get in there and stay put.
[Sighs]
[Man]
Over here, Mac.
It's, uh, not that
I don't trust you, Mac.
But since it's cash this time,
notjust supplies...
I thought it'd be easier if wejust
divvied it up here, right at the scene.
- Your boys know this spot?
- Don't worry about them.
They're all good at theirjobs.
Well, they oughta be.
I pay 'em enough.
Well, if that train left on time, oughta be here in less than five minutes.
I'll be glad when that money's off this train.
If we just keep movin' and stay buttoned up, everything'd be all right.
[Train Whistle Blowing]
And the cap.
[Grunts]
[Screaming]
- Thank you. Tickets, please.
- What was that, Theodore?
I don't know.
And it's Running Bear, not Theodore.
- Yeah, but, Theo...
- How many times do I have to keep telling you?
I'm Running Bear and you're Standing Elk.
Now, hush up!
[Blainey]
I saidjump!
[Screams]
Uh, Running Bear...
Standing Elk just saw
Screaming Eagle and Flying Corporal.
[Chuckles]
It was just, uh...
There's not much time.
Unlock that door.
[Grunting]
[Whooping]
[Man]
It's Indians!
- [Gunshots]
- [Passengers Chattering]
I wonder what they want.
Hey. Aah! Theo.
- What's goin' on out there?
- [Whooping Continues]
Indians. The Indians have been peaceful for years.
- I wonder what stirred them up?
- I don't know.
But I don't like it.
Let's get outta here.
- [Man Speaking In Native Dialect]
- Oooh.
- [Passengers Shouting, Screaming]
- Get down!
Check the women!
I think those two are lookin' for us.
Yeah, but, uh...
I think I'd rather rob a train.
[Gunshots Continue]
Hi, Reno. It-It's us.
Do ya need any help?
Where you two been?
Get in here!
- I knew you had enough help...
- Come here.
[Speaking In Native Dialect]
[Screams]
[All Grunting]
[Whooping Continues]
[Amos]
Oh, boy, look at that.
I thought you people just wanted guns and beads.
There's nothin' in there but bills. Show him, Reno.
Yeah.
No want paper.
Want them.
- [Gasps]
- White man trade donkey with my squaw for two blankets.
Then donkey run away.
Dirty white man trick.
Squaw want blankets back.
You got 'em, chief.
- Give me these!
- I, uh...
[Laughing]
[Stammering]
Come on, Mac!
Get on with it!
All right, everybody got what they want? Now we can all get down to business.
Not quite. I haven't got what I came for.
Millie. Private Reid.
It's Captain Phillips, Lieutenant,
U.S. Army Intelligence.
You and your sidekicks
are all under arrest.
- Get the bags.
- So if you'll kindly dismount,
very slowly, please...
drop your arms,
you can all ride...
Amos, what are you doing?
- I'm trying...
- Will you please hurry and help...
[Screaming, Grunts]
[Reid] Hey! Who is that?
What's goin'on there? Hey!
- Who is that down there?
- Oh, Amos and Theodore, Captain.
Remember us, from the fort?
Yes, good work down there, soldier... uh, uh, men... uh, good work.
- Phillips, you can't arrest me.
- Oh, yes, I most certainly can.
- You don't have anything on me.
- We'll see about that, Lieutenant.
Your entire operation will be closely examined at your general court-martial.
And in the meantime,
you and your sidekicks here...
can ride back in the baggage cart,
if you don't mind, sir.
Right there.
Right there, right there.
Right, right.
Right there. There.
Well, move it.
[Chuckles]
All right, come on, come on, come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
"It was a distinctive gold coin... spent at the Variety Saloon that led to the capture and..."
- What's that?
- "Incarceration."
- That means to "cart 'em back there."
- Right.
"...incarceration of the real bank robbers,
Wes Hardin and Frank Starrett.
"Mr. Hitchcock, in a statement to The Clarion...
"said he knew all along the Apple Dumpling Gang was not guilty... but he wanted the real robbers,
Hardin and Starrett, to relax their v-v-v..."
- What's that?
- "Vigilance."
- It means to "rest their horses."
- Oh.
Kids'll be surprised we got an honorable discharge from the Army.
- Yeah. [Chuckles]
- When do you think we'll be home?
- A day and a half.
- That'll be Tuesday.
Boy, I hope there's some of that leftover pot roast.
I bet Mr. Donovan and Dusty'll be real surprised to see us.
Yep. I'll bet that place is a rack and ruin since we been gone.
Oh, Mr. Beauregard!
We have ah... an answer for you from New Orleans.
What'd they say?
"Sundowner sails the 21st. Stop.
Destination Europe.
Stop. Reservation... confirmed. Stop.
Request deposit 500 dollars. Stop."
- Hey! What about the 500 dollars?
- No hurry.
The important thing is there's a ship.
Hey!
10 dollars!
How'd he do it, Pa?
I only heard one shot!
It's a question of speed, son.
Pa, ain't nobody faster on the draw than him?
Faster than him?
Nobody.
My Name is Nobody
Red!
Too late, amigo.
Who did it?
You did... when you first started looking for me.
Where's Nevada?
Hold up in Acoma.
He ain't about to move from there.
What were you doing here?
Who shot you?
- Go...
- Where?
You can go fuck yourself.
You and you alone... are responsible to me and my men for making the gold legal.
Instead, Sullivan, you chase after your own personal affairs!
You're leaving a trail of dead bodies all the way across the state!
A trail that leads straight here.
- Jack Beauregard.
- Yeah.
We pay you 'cause you're respectable.
A gentleman!
Bought a worked out gold mine and discovered a new vein.
But any suspicion that falls on you, falls on the gold.
What are you afraid of?
You got everyone exactly where you want them.
I could shout the truth from the rooftops.
I could bring the sheriff in here... and say, "Look, if we didn't add that stolen gold of yore... this mine would only produce rock!"
I could even show them and nobody would believe me.
- And they'd all be blind and deaf.
- But not dumb!
There's talk going around,
Sullivan.
Talk has a way of getting into places where there ain't no fear.
The ore that comes out of this mine... has got to be refined legally!
You keep your hands clean,
Sullivan.
But if I don't kill Beauregard first, he'll kill me.
That's right.
Two things go straight to a man's heart: bullets and gold.
You're telling me to buy Jack Beauregard?
Why not?
We bought you.
Buy him or kill him!
But do it fast.
You hear me? Fast!
Hey! Load up 20 of them horseshoes.
- Is it going to take much longer?
- No, nearly done.
He's got nothing but junk here.
Look at this.
Who's gonna buy this?
And this?
Even a broken shoe.
Hey! You!
Hey, where'd he come from?
What are you doing in there?
- I was sleeping.
- Well, this ain't no hotel.
- What are you looking for?
- A horse.
Hey, make him pay first!
Why?
'Cause you don't look like you're gonna live long enough to get credit.
Where you going?
The secret of a long life... is to try not to shorten it.
Hey! Hold on there!
- Maybe I can get you a horse.
- Honest?
Why, sure...
- But first, you gotta do me a little favor.
- Uh, huh.
Come here.
Gimme here!
There's a pal of mine over there in that saloon.
You take him this basket. When you get back, I'll find you a horse.
This pal of yours is
Jack Beauregard, huh?
- What?
- Uh, uh! A bargain's a bargain.
- A horse, huh?
- Sure, son.
The best.
I smell beans and bacon, Bonita.
That's right. They're for the three men out there.
Better let me have 'em. I don't think they'll be hungry much longer.
Is the ship still there?
"Sailing date 16 days. Stop.
Must have 500 dollars to confirm reservation. Stop."
What shall I tell
New Orleans, mister?
There's still 16 days.
16 days ain't very long, even for someone like you.
If you go away, who's gonna be left?
Nobody.
Maybe so, but a man's gotta quit sometime.
Sometime.
But someone like you gotta go out with style.
You come here just to tell me that?
Well, no.
- For me?
- Uh, huh.
What'd you think it's in it?
I reckon it's a bomb.
I reckon you're right.
Who sent it?
Three fellows out there.
Only three.
- Only?
- Yeah, like that time in El Paso.
5th of March, 1882.
Billy Mason...
John Murray...
Fred Carson.
82 was one of your best years.
In April...
- Why'd you bring me this for?
- A horse.
Like I was saying, in April, in Albuquerque... four: Jackson,
Johnson, Murdoch... and Champion.
How many horses do you want to take it back?
Oh, none. My pleasure.
But it was in the fall that you really scored.
September. Socorro.
Five.
Milton, Woolman, Firestone,
McDonald and Valence.
How come you know so much about me?
Everyone knows about
Jack Beauregard.
Only hope for law and order in the West.
Son, let me give you a little advice.
You start admiring someone, pretty soon you're envious... so you start showing off, taking chances.
Before you know it, you're dead.
Well, it ain't good for some folks to live too long.
And in Gila Blend, how many did you get that time?
Six. Oh, no! Seven!
Counting that fellow that tried to gun you when your back was turned.
He says he don't want it!
But you never got
150 all at once.
You know, since I was a boy,
I always dreamed of you like that.
An immense open plain.
150 pure bred sons of bitches on horseback... and you facing them. Alone.
Why only 150?
The Wild Bunch.
They are only 150. That's why.
Yeah, 150 who shoot and ride like there's thousands.
Who are you anyway?
- Who? Me?
Nobody.
Tell you what, first you get to be somebody, then you and me'll surround them.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, that's no good!
You got to face them alone!
You on one side, and them on the other!
You won't need to wash it this time!
What was in that basket?
Do you want a hand?
Hey, Jack!
Jack, I've found a horse! Wait!
Turn around, you!
- You mean we gotta shoot it out?
- So you're Beauregard's friend?
I wish I was.
You know what they say?
He could draw his guns 3 times before the other fellow even starts reaching.
Like this.
Well, if we gotta shoot it out,
I'm ready.
Well, ah, just a...
Hey, hey, you gotta admit, he did deliver the basket.
- Yeah.
- Sure.
- But that son of...
- Beauregard. He didn't want it.
You're right!
Guess you earned yourself a horse.
Oh, thanks, amigo.
I'll take this one.
Help me!
Blessed is the man who shares his neighbour’s burden.
Seen a white man around here?
I'm looking for a white man.
You seen him?
Where is he?
Don't worry. I won't hurt him.
He's my brother.
What are you doing here?
Praying.
- Good thing you are.
- Why?
'Cause you're always following me, and I don't like it.
I got a lot of friends here.
Chief Broken Branch died yesterday.
The priest got there in time, but the Medicine men didn't.
What brings you here among the ancients anyway?
I'm looking for someone.
"Sam Peckinpah".
That's a beautiful name in Navajo.
- Friend or enemy?
- That's my business.
Listen to this one.
"He no poke no more".
- What's his name?
- That's his business.
"Nevada Kid".
You know where he is?
Must be down below.
It's always the best who are the first to go.
Which means you ain't going nowhere.
'Staying here with your
Indian friends for good.
What's the matter, boy?
You gotta have a crowd watching?
You said you was nobody.
Well, here's your chance to make a name for yourself on one of them.
Turn around!
Draw.
Let's bring my personal history up to date.
Today, June 3rd, 1899:
Nobody.
Yeah, you're the kind that needs an audience, so you can show off.
Four shots, one hole.
Just like the good old days.
There was never any
"good old days".
Tell me, what's your game?
When I was a kid I used to make believe I was Jack Beauregard.
And now that you're all growed-up?
I'm more cautious.
But sometimes running a little risk... can bring big rewards, you know?
If the risk is little, the reward is little.
First Nevada... then Red.
- They even tried to get me twice.
- And they'll try again.
What the hell are they up to?
You'll find out.
I see it clear as crystal...
Jack Beauregard, standing alone, facing the Wild Bunch.
Just think of it. You'll be written up in all the history books!
You'll be down on earth reading 'em.
While I'm up there playing on a harp.
You shine like the door of a whorehouse.
A blind man can spot you 10 miles off.
Well, I like folks to see me.
Maybe folks don't share your pleasure.
Thanks, but I prefer my own. Lets the air through. Sharpens the wits.
Just a matter of time before someone's gonna shoot holes in yours!
Out of the way, shorty!
Or I'll crush you underfoot like a flea!
You look so small from up here,
I can't hardly see you!
You got the message?
See me better now?
I wish I'd never seen ya!
Here ya go! Anybody else?
Come on, now!
Anybody else want to try?
- I wanna try.
- Thank you.
Hey, have another try.
It's like courting a woman, folks.
You give her the glad eye, and she gives you a black eye!
You offer her beefsteak, and she makes mincemeat out of you.
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Come on up here and try your skills.
Come on now, folks. Step right up!
They just scored 5 hits!
Come on, folks!
Give 'em everything you got!
Three eggs for only half a dollar!
One custard pie for one dollar!
And for the reduced bargain price of only 2 dollars,
I am gonna part with 6, count them, 6 ripe cantelops!
And when I say ripe, believe me, I mean ripe!
Toss 'em fast and toss 'em strong!
Come on, move your arms, now!
Come on, folks!
Give 'em all you got!
Toss it fast!
And toss 'em strong!
Come on! Move your arms, now!
Watch your aim!
Come on, everybody!
Give 'em everything you got!
The fun of the game...
What did you say the fun of the game is?
Son of a bitch!
I'm gonna stay as long as I like!
I got as much right as anyone to be here!
Sleep dead, grandpa!
You stinkin', mangy polecat!
One of these days, the worm is gonna turn and nip you all right in the bud!
You tell your stinking boss Sullivan!
And who the hell are you?
I'll take 3 to 1 on Squirrel!
Another 10 dollars on Squirrel.
Well, folks...!
Three to one on Squirrel!
He's a good shot, folks, but he can also miss!
Come on, now!
This could be your lucky chance!
Hi.
Beer.
- How'd you like to play with this?
- Like that?
Hey, what's the game?
Can I play too?
Sure.
Anyone can play.
If you can afford it, if you can shoot... and if you can drink.
Okay, I'll have a go.
- 10... ah... 20.
- Know the rules?
Gotta hit the glass before it hits the floor.
Come on, folks! Who'll take me on?
Place your bets.
Who'll take 2 to 1 on the stranger?
3 to 1! This is real special!
Any takers? Come on, folks!
Hey, Marshal! Marshal, here!
Can't I do it with milk?
I'll take 5!
Come on, folks, 5 to 1!
Come on, now!
Who'll take me on?
Here's 6 for me, marshal!
Lucky skunk!
That one got away.
Lucky bastard!
Come on, now, 7 to 1!
Who'll take me on?
Lucky shit!
Hold it!
The game's over.
- Lucky...
- That he wasn't aiming at you.
There you are, 200.
Give me a whiskey.
These games sure make a man thirsty.
That evens the score for glasses.
Now let's try pistols.
These upside down pistols of yours really worry me.
Fellows that carry 'em like that are bad medicine.
Clown.
- Now we can't miss.
- Smart aleck.
Fellows like you never seem to catch on.
It's actually very simple.
Now pay attention, huh.
How do you do?
We play for higher stakes up here.
Skip's talking to you.
Why don't ya join us?
It ain't nice to shoot a man in the back.
This a game two can play?
If you know the rules.
For me, every game has the same rule.
Play to win.
The whole town's gotta see this game.
Big audience, big take.
Two thousand.
Who's gonna lose this hand?
The loser will be here tomorrow morning.
Name's Jack Beauregard.
That's a name to reckon with.
How much do you reckon?
Five hundred?
A thousand more, perhaps.
I reckon I may never spend it.
Why Jack Beauregard?
Will this do for an answer?
You paid for a front row seat.
Don't miss the show.
I won't.
Hey!
That's only three shots.
You still got one to go.
The next one might hit a couple of inches lower.
Your life's hanging by a thread,
Mr. Beauregard.
Looks like you finally got your audience, so I guess we can...
- Wind up this little story.
- It's an old story for you.
January '86. Madison.
The same situation, remember?
Except I was facing three bastards that day.
Exactly.
Seems like that hole was just aching for another bullet.
Remember, boys, when the spirit is willing... the flesh has the strength of ten.
Can I send a telegram?
Yes, sir.
It'll cost you 25 cents a word.
Maritime Company, New Orleans.
Request confirmation reservation
Sundowner sailing 12 days. Stop.
500 dollar deposit follows.
Stop.
Signed: Jack Beauregard.
Look who's back.
What are you holding that up there for?
Idiots!
You go catch those two.
He's gone into the corner room.
Come on. Quiet.
Up there. I guess he's asleep.
I heard him setting his alarm clock.
Well, this will wake him quicker than any alarm.
He must be right up there.
I'll go.
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn't.
- He must be on the other side.
- I'm here.
- Break a mirror is bad luck.
- Give me a match.
Light it.
Well, it only last one minute.
Light it!
Don't... don't you think
I oughta get down?
People go around wasting days and weeks and years... and all of a sudden there's only 30 seconds to go.
Stop! Wait!
It stopped.
Happens to everyone, sooner or later.
Don John, where are you?
I'm here.
Me too.
Wait! Bang!
Thank you, man.
- That's real funny!
- Nothing funny about death.
Shut up!
There are eight of them!
- Look!
- What a lot of Nobody's!
Reflection's one and all.
But in truth, there's only one.
- Guess which is that son of a gun.
- The third one!
Geez, you really are slippin'.
Here, hold this.
Who? Me?
Yes, you!
- Well?
- Well...
Nevada and that other sneak thief, Red... they bought me out.
For 200 dollars!
Fine partners I had. My share of the mine for $200 measly stinking dollars!
And now, my bank's empty.
I got so mad it gave me asthma!
You see the way I'm forced to live now.
I have to breath this shit!
I don't want to talk no more about that stinking business.
Ain't no use you persisting!
If you want to persist... you'll have to persist harder!
It was Nevada himself who told me.
It's a whole pile of shit.
That ain't no mine.
It's just a hole in the ground.
Nobody ain't never gonna find no gold in there.
Now, that city slicker.
That Sullivan... he wants to buy it for 600 dollars.
And that ain't hay dough.
Why you could live on your share of it for a year.
That's what they told me.
- Then what?
- The year run out... the money ran out, and the liquor ran out.
Yeah, this'll quench your thirst.
And come to the point 'cause
I got no more dough either.
Tarnation! That mine began pouring out gold... like the mountain was made of it.
And I say I deserve a share.
Or at least enough to keep me in liquor.
What did Red and Nevada do?
They ran off somewhere.
The dirty coyotes!
Red and Nevada are dead.
You can drink to their memory.
Like I said, he who lives by the sword will get nipped in the bud.
No, no, no! I surrender!
Next time, knock before you come busting in.
You playing games?
There've been a lot of guys try to kill me... just so they can brag about it for the rest of their lives.
You had your audience this morning.
You had your target.
That kind of opportunity don't knock twice.
Well, it depends on your point of view.
- It's a dangerous game.
- Yeah.
It ain't easy to make balls spin.
But even if you do, sooner or later, they're bound to wind up in the hole.
It's gone in! It's gone in! It's ga....
Missed by a hair!
Fact is, you saved my life today.
But I'd rather is was my fault I got shot, than your fault I didn't.
That's a pile of horse manure, son.
It's better not to get shot for nobody's fault.
Why did you blow in these balls?
It don't count.
- I wanted to let out some air.
- While you're letting out all that air... suppose you tell me why you were sitting in the street this morning.
I got tired of standing.
You keep turning your back to me.
Seems like you trust me too much, or maybe you trust yourself too much.
You ever hear the story about the little birdy?
My grandpa used to tell it to me.
When I was a boy, man didn't live long enough to become grandpa's.
It wasn't easy, son, but it could be done.
There was this little birdie who didn't even know how to fly yet.
One freezing cold night, he tumbles out of his nest, lands on the ground.
Well, he starts going... like crazy 'cause he's damn nearly freezing!
Lucky for him.
Along comes this cow... sees him, and feels sorry for him. So... she lifts her tail... and... splat, drops this steaming hot cowpie right on him.
The little birdie's nice and warm again... but he still ain't happy and keeps going...
Louder than ever.
A mean old coyote hears him and comes a running.
He reaches out a paw... and pulls him out of the cow pie.
He brushes the dirt off him real nice... and then... swallows the birdie down in one gulp!
Grandpa said there was a moral there... but you had to figure it out for yourself.
Bird... coyote... cow pies... don't make no sense to me, no how.
You still believe in fairy tales.
Yep.
For example... this is the good guy, who's gotta avenge his brother.
And this is the bad guy... who's gonna get killed, because he shot the good guy's brother.
- And this...
- Is my blue-eyed angel... who protects me from harm.
That's Nobody.
That leaves you and me face to face.
Huh?
Nope.
That leaves you alone... against 150.
You're sure trying hard to make a hero out of me.
You're that already.
You just need a special act.
Something that'll make your name a legend.
What I don't understand is:
What difference it makes to you?
A man who's a man, needs someone to believe in.
I've met all kinds in my life... thieves and killers... pimps and prostitutes... con men and preachers.
Even a few fellows that told the truth.
The kind of man you're talking about, never.
Maybe you've never met them... or hardly ever.
They're the only ones who count.
Reckon this fellow's name is Sullivan?
Reckon it is.
Hey! Hey!
He's taking Sullivan away!
But Sullivan's nothing.
It's the Wild Bunch in the back of him.
- We've got to warn that young fella.
- Uh-uh.
But don't you see?
If he kills Sullivan... he'll have 150 blood thirsty cutthroats on his tail!
He's gonna make trouble for hisself.
No, he's gonna make a name for himself.
The way he's galloping, he must be in a hurry to make it.
If you kill me, the Wild Bunch will know that you're on to their game.
They told me, kill him or buy him.
I wouldn't have tried, unless it was my last chance.
You know what Nevada was like.
We had a little agreement... him, Red and me, for an extra share between us.
And you know even better than me how he hated sharing anything.
And he deserved the bullet he got.
Red did it.
But I kept his share.
And it's yours now.
Take all you want.
You can live like a king for a hundred years.
I don't intend to get that old.
I only need 500.
Is there a telegraph office in town?
- How do I get the train for New Orleans?
- Follow the tracks east of Kimble.
There's a train from there every Friday.
Disappointed?
Yep.
Thought I could count on your brotherly feeling.
Beats me how kids like you think if a man's older than you... he goes along with old fashioned notions like... like "blood's thicker than water".
Sure, Nevada's my brother... but he's a grade A skunk who shot people in the back.
What's more, he stole
10 thousand dollars off me.
I ain't risking my life to avenge him.
My, my! How modern the old folks are becoming!
But a hero can't run away from his destiny.
My destiny is to get the hell out of here.
I've got an appointment with a ship that's sailing for Europe.
Sometimes you run smack into your destiny... on the very road you take to get away from it.
If you're still thinking about the Wild Bunch, forget it.
I ain't taking them on.
You will, Jack. You will.
Put it over there.
Hold it!
- Where is it going?
- Use your eyes, man.
It's shunting.
But... who's driving it?
Who!?
They've stolen the train!
There's only 150 of them... but they ride like they were thousands.
A man's gotta quit sometime.
But someone like you's gotta go out with style!
Just think of it.
150 pure bred sons of bitches on horseback... and you facing them. Alone.
You'll be written up in all the history books.
And you'll be down on earth reading 'em.
While I'm under it, in my grave.
You shine like the door of a whorehouse.
I like folks to see me.
You'll end in history.
You'll end in history.
You'll end in history.
You'll end in history!
You'll end it in history!
Well... now you got me in the history books...
- How do I quit?
- There's only one way.
How's that?
You gotta die.
Where?
Where there's lots of people.
They gonna shoot each other!
Come on!
Let's get out of the way!
I told you your life was hanging by a thread.
Dear Nobody... dying is not the worse thing that can happen to a man.
Look at me. I've been dead for 3 days now, and I've finally found my peace.
You used to say that my life was hanging by a thread.
Maybe so, but I'm afraid it's your life that's hanging by a thread, now.
Well, that's one.
Let's get the other!
And there's quite a few people who'd like to cut that thread.
Yeah, I guess it's your way of feeling alive.
You see, that's the whole difference between you and me.
I've always tried to steer away from trouble... but you seem to be looking for it all the time.
But I must admit, you've been able to solve your share... even if you like others to take the credit.
This way you can remain a Nobody.
You got it all nicely figured out.
But you gambled too big this time... and there's too many people who know you're somebody after all... and you won't have much time for playing your funny games.
They'll make life harder and harder for you... until you too meet somebody who wants to put you down in history.
And so you'll find out that the only way to become a Nobody again... is to die.
Anyhow, from now on you'll be walking in my boots... and maybe you won't be laughing so loud anymore.
But you can still do one thing:
You can preserve a little of that illusion... that made my generation tick.
Maybe you'll do it in your own funny way but... we'll be grateful just the same.
'Cause looking back... seems to me we were all a bunch of romantic fools... who still believed that a good pistol... and quick showdown could solve everything.
But then the
West used to be wide... open spaces with lots of elbow room... where you never ran into the same person twice.
By the time you came along it was changed.
Got small and crowded... and you kept bumping at the same people all the time.
But if you're able to run around in the West peacefully, catching flies... it's only 'cause fellows like me were there first.
Yeah, the same fellows you wanna see written up in history books.
'Cause people need something to believe in, like you say.
But you won't be able to have it your own way much longer...
'cause the country ain't the same anymore... and I'm already feeling the strange in myself.
But, what's worse, violence has changed, too.
It's grown and got organized... and a good pistol don't mean a damn thing anymore.
But I guess you must know all this...
'cause it's your kind of times, not mine.
And I also figured out the moral to your grandpa's story.
The one about the cow that cover the little bird with cowpie... to keep it warm and then the coyote hauled it out an ate it.
It's the moral of these new times of yours.
Folks that throw dirt on you aren't always trying to hurt you.
And folks that pull you out of a jam aren't always trying to help you.
But the main point is:
When you're up to your nose in shit, keep your mouth shut.
This is why people like me gotta go.
And this is why you faked than gun fight... to get me out of the West clean.
Anyhow, I was getting to be one more old timer.
And the years don't make wisdom, they just make old age.
One can be young in years, and old in hours, like you.
I guess I'm talking like a damn preacher, but it's your fault.
What can you expect of a national monument?
Well, keep your mind and your heart open.
And if you ever meet one of those men you almost never meet... you can keep each other company and it won't be so lonely for you.
They say distance makes friendship grow stronger.
Maybe so, 'cause after three days without you dogging my tracks...
I kinda miss ya.
I really gotta sign off now, so... even if you've been a stinking nosy troublemaker all the time... thanks for everything just the same.
P.S. Just one more piece of advice from an old timer:
When you're gettin' a shave and a cut... be sure the right man's wearing the jacket.
You're going through here too fast.
You'll swamp the other boats.
You don't have to use the wheel now. Just the gears.
- Easy. This way.
- Ah.
Slow down!
Of course.
Very good, very good.
Salut, Joel hello, francois!
Looks like you hooked a big one!
Easy. Easy now.
- Ah.
- Easy.
Very good, herr langsdorff. Very good.
Very good.
That's it, that's it.
Watch that boat in front of you.
Salut, yankee.
Are we seeing you tonight?
Oh, I don't know.
I might have some work to do.
You want the revenge.
Revenge?
Or a lesson, huh?
Herr langsdorff.
You know, you could make a first-class pilot.
You see what he says?
Come.
Papi, you...
Yeah. Captain?
Will you come for a drink with us now?
Well, you see, sailors never drink.
Well, they don't when they're working.
Sometimes.
Marius, give Jean-Paul a hand with that, will ya?
Wrap it up and put it in the back of his car.
Is that all?
Same time tomorrow?
Same time.
Bonjour, monsieur Martin.
Bonjour.
I was worried. You're later than usual.
Yeah, what's new?
Several people calling about prices.
A booking for Saturday.
Five Americans sent by the concierge of the negresco.
Send the concierge a commission.
What else?
Your wife. Wanted to know if you're in for dinner.
Uh, call her back.
Tell her I have another engagement.
Say it's a big deal.
- No!
- No, no!
No, no!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You gentlemen made the rules.
But three times in a week to be taken to the cleaners!
Wait till next time. Worse.
We said 11:00, right.
But rules, they're just there to be broken!
You know that's how wars start?
Aw, I'll give you another chance.
We'll divide the money in half.
Flip a coin.
Tails, you split it.
Heads, I keep it all. Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Do you want to change?
- No, no.
We'll stick to tails.
Well, that's life.
I wouldn't put it past him.
A double-headed coin.
Who needs a double-headed coin?
- Good night, boys.
- Good night.
Good night.
If we are going to take money off that one, it's not going to be with cards.
No, next time, we'd better try chloroform!
Oh, good boy, jazz.
Anxious to get out, are you?
Be careful when you cross the road.
You never say nice things like that to me.
You're watching a western?
I wonder what would happen if one day they shot him?
Probably improve the program.
Am I wrong, but are you later than usual?
All you girls seem to say the same thing.
Oh, well.
I thought you were at the harbor tonight, not out on the town.
But, of course, two can play at the same game.
Well, five or six is even better.
More money in it.
Ah. I always wanted to know what that felt like.
It tickles.
Well, what kind of a day did you have?
The usual.
Cleaned the house while mother Maria talked and spilled cigarette ashes on the floor.
That's all.
Why do you keep her, then?
Gets lonely otherwise, with you away all day and sometimes all night.
Do you have to have another?
No, I don't have to have another, but I feel like it.
Boy, the way you crowd me, you'd think I was an alcoholic or something.
It's just that the day gets long when you're alone most of the time.
Of course, I knew what I married.
People like you never change, but sometimes I wonder why I stay married.
And sometimes I know why I stay married.
Oh. I forgot to tell you.
Some idiot kept calling.
Doesn't say a word, then hangs up.
I'll take care of it.
Yeah.
What?
The name is Joe Martin.
M-a-r-t-i-n. You have the wrong party.
Who was it, Joe?
Joe, what's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
Some guy insisting my name is Joe moran.
What else did he say?
Just, uh...
Some kind of a nut.
Just what?
Just said he wanted to kill me.
Whoever that joker thinks he is, I'm going to call the police and...
No, it's not something for the police.
I'll handle it.
But first I want you out of the house.
Stay with your mother.
In the morning, pick up the girl at camp.
Now, go on up and get dressed.
- Joe, call the poli...
- Just do as I say.
Wait a minute.
It's the petrances.
It's Lillian's birthday.
We should tell some of them to come over.
Hell of a lot of help they'd be in their condition.
Go lock up in the kitchen, and pull all the curtains.
Go upstairs. Lock yourself in your room.
Joe, be careful.
Lock yourself in your room.
Joe?
Joe?
Joe?
Come in. Come all the way in.
Joe.
You bastard!
Hitting an unarmed man.
Aw, he'll live.
I can't do without him for the moment.
I don't know what you're after, but you might like to know that the police are on their way over.
You wouldn't want to bet on that?
I phoned them right after your last call.
Sure you did.
Joe wants the cops in on this.
Why shouldn't he?
He can tell you that better than me.
Go ahead, Mrs. moran. Wake him up.
What was that you called me?
Our name is Martin.
You've attacked the wrong man.
Maybe you married the wrong man, huh?
No. He hasn't changed much.
I'd recognize him anywhere, even from a picture two years old.
What's this got to do with it? I mean...
Ah, finally.
Bonsoir, mon sergent.
Isn't that how they put it in your new country?
And surprised to see your old friend Vermont.
Yeah.
Surprised to see you out on your own.
You've always needed help before.
You didn't like that, huh? Well, how about
"you're big and you're tough."
Especially when you're holding that.
The lone ranger.
You don't need anybody to hold your hand anymore, huh?
Maybe I've learned to manage for myself.
I've had plenty of time in seven years.
I'd better go.
It's the police.
You've still got time to run for it.
We won't talk.
Fabienne!
- Come on over and have a drink.
- Yoo-hoo!
There's a lot of boozers out here.
- They wanted you to join them for a drink.
- Joe!
- Quickly, before the drinks run out.
- Come on!
Those French cops, they know how to live, don't they?
Oh! What are you after? Money?
That's all we've got in the house.
Go on. Take it.
You must think I'm some kind of a crook.
Aren't you?
You tell her, or doesn't she know about your army buddies?
For a start, you tell me who this
Joe moran is I'm suddenly married to.
Yes, tell her, sergeant.
Go on. I've got time.
What are you doing back out on the street?
- Unexpected, huh?
- "Unexpected"?
You didn't need that.
You could've knocked me over with a feather.
You didn't know we'd catch up with you sooner or later?
"We"? - T would.
Or whoever got out first.
Figured.
At least you seem to know each other.
You don't deny that.
Yeah, I know him.
Well enough for him to hit you on the head?
It happens in the best of families.
How...
How did you know where to find me?
Show him.
It's that Greek millionaire you saved.
Yeah, yeah, I knew
I should have let him drown.
That's when I got the idea of the boat.
What about the boat?
I knew if there was one guy
I could count on to share his last crust, even his fast boat...
Well, now, which...
Which country you trying to get to?
You'll find out later.
For the moment, just get down to the boat.
You must be crazy. Now?
I said to the boat, and now.
Get your coat.
Well, I hope you know what you're doing.
Oh, yeah, my coat.
Taking a boat out in the middle of the night.
Fabienne, I'll see you later.
No sweat. The little lady's coming too.
What for?
I'm sure you'll be easier to handle with this one around.
I agreed to take you, not her.
Sarge, baby,
I don't think you heard me right.
Get ready, honey.
Okay. Don't argue with him.
Just do as Vermont says.
No, no, no! Oh!
Oh, god. Thank god.
Okay, okay.
What is it, Joe?
You can tell the police it was self-defense.
Then what in heaven's name are you afraid of?
I still want you to go to your mother's, pick up michéle in the morning. Go on.
It must be pretty ugly, whatever it is you're trying to hide.
Can't you ever do anything
I tell you to do?
Yes, it's ugly!
So, that's what's been bothering you.
Your drinking, your bad nerves, your nightmare.
They weren't souvenirs from your war in Korea.
No, they weren't souvenirs.
- You lied to me, then.
- No, I didn't lie.
I just didn't bother explaining the reasons for my nightmares or my drinking.
It's got nothing to do with you.
Of course.
A man threatens you with a gun, you break his neck, we can't call the police, but it's nothing to do with me.
Oh, well, putting it that way...
You better hear it from me first.
Sit down. I'll get you a drink.
You remember me talking about Ross?
Captain Ross, my commanding officer in Korea?
He was a good soldier, but one thing I didn't tell ya...
After the shooting stopped over there, we were transferred back to Germany, and things got a little too quiet for him.
So, he started a little business on the side, beginning with graft, kickbacks from service clubs, and ending up with hijacking us army trucks.
He sold the stuff on the black market.
Sometimes around his headquarters, you couldn't tell the mafia from the army.
And, boy, he must have a lot of loot stashed away somewhere.
- Phew!
- And you were mixed up with him?
No, I never fraternized with officers, except in the stockade, where all men were made equal.
And where he had ended up only because while it's all right for officers to steal from the army, you shouldn't make a pig out of yourself.
You didn't tell me what you were doing in the stockade?
One Saturday night when I couldn't see straight from this stuff,
I belted an officer.
Happened to be a chicken colonel.
He was sure asking for it.
Everybody was happy I hit him.
I got two years just the same.
So, when Ross invited me to bust out with him and Vermont...
And Ross knew I was a damn good driver...
I thought, "why not?"
I had nothing to lose. I was through with the army anyhow.
It all started off smoothly enough.
The break had been well-planned.
The hardest part was over.
We only had to climb down the outer wall.
There, we had a man waiting.
His name was katanga.
Ex-foreign legion.
He had new clothes ready for us, a fast car, false papers.
And then a German cop happened along.
Had to put his nose into it.
He wanted to see our papers.
I didn't want any part of that action.
You know, they each received
20 years in a German prison.
And if I had stuck around,
I would have drawn at least ten.
- For what?
- You'll have to go to the police one day.
And give up everything
I've worked for all these years?
Oh, fabienne.
And you and michéle, what'll you do when I'm away?
We wait.
Like hell. I wait.
Including him?
I'm only waiting for the streets to empty, and I'll take care of that problem like they do in the army.
Sweep it under the rug. Come on.
Just pack a small suitcase.
You might not have to be away long.
You don't understand.
I'm coming with you.
Oh, no, fabienne.
That makes you an accessory.
I became that the day I married you.
Open up, Joe!
Open up, Joe! I can see your light on!
Fabienne.
Turn one small lamp on.
I've lost the key to the back door!
Go around the front.
- Okay!
- Watch it!
Okay, Joel
Let them in.
- Fabienne!
- Come on, fabienne!
- Fabienne! Fabienne!
- I'm coming. I'm coming.
Ah, at last!
- Yeah, hello.
- Come on over.
Bonsoir, everybody.
Come on in.
- Jazz, will you be quiet. Come on in.
- Can I bother you for some ice?
- Of course.
- What would you like to drink?
I would have come to your party earlier, but, uh...
Fabienne. Fabienne?
Let's see now. Uh, I have some whiskey.
- How about whiskey?
- We mustn't keep you up.
- One already poured. Ah, but you need it.
- Ice is all we need.
Ladies' man.
Fabienne!
- Can I help you?
- Oh, no.
- It's such a mess in here. I'm coming.
- Oh, all right.
Have it your way.
Hurry up, fabienne!
Yes, I'm coming!
Come right over here.
- Anybody want a refill?
- No.
You sure?
- Ah, here's some ice.
- Oh!
- Thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.
- There you are.
- Okay.
- Come on. Let's go back to the house.
- Good night, fabienne.
- Good night.
- Oh, no!
- We're celebrating the 14th of July!
- Good night.
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.
- Come on. Let's go home.
- Okay.
Doo-doo-doo
Even if we wanted to now, we can't call the police.
Oh!
Oh...
Don't forget to lock up, okay?
Go back up on the road and keep your eyes open, okay?
Okay.
Joe, watch out!
Are you okay?
Don't worry. I'm fine.
Sure? We can give you a ride.
And we still have some time for a drink at the whiskey-a-go-go.
Oh, I'd love to. Do you mind if I bring my husband?
Oh!
Wait here, fabienne. I'll get some things, we'll clean up the car.
Jazz.
Jazz?
Get the hell outta herel
I remember when you used to call me "sir."
Get out, sir!
Jazz.
Aw, jazz.
Katanga isn't sentimental about animals like we Americans.
Joe, what's keeping you?
I can't imagine what you were doing out tonight, Joe.
Not with a wife like that and available.
She was just leaving. Come on.
She's not leaving us just yet.
No. Make some more coffee.
As I seem to be kept around, you might as well introduce your friends.
Yeah. My friends.
That's Ross, fausto, and this is katanga, if I remember right.
You remember right.
He's ex-foreign legion.
Crack soldiers. The French are especially proud of them.
They always look so good marching down the champs-elysées on the 14th of July that everybody tries to forget what they did to people in indochina and Algiers.
Not that we Americans have done too badly since we took over.
In indochina, I mean.
We haven't arrived in Algiers yet.
Now that you have me thoroughly scared, what the hell do you want?
First, I want to balance the books.
Secondly,
I'd like to know where Vermont is.
Vermont?
He make the break with you?
You might have left him behind.
We're not like that.
Where is he? I can see he's been here.
Beats me.
The captain asked you a question.
Why don't you tell the captain I don't know.
I'll talk to you later.
Yes, what did you do with Vermont?
Uh, you dump his body somewhere?
Ah, that makes it even more convenient, doesn't it?
Especially if you had any bright ideas of calling the police.
As I should have done a long time before.
And Joe may be on his way to jail by now, instead of...
No hard feelings, sergeant.
We just sent Vermont up to fetch you.
But if he couldn't do a little thing like that, I guess he's not much of a loss,
- long as we got you to take his place.
- Why don't you spell it out?
Why do we stand here bartering with that rat?
Shut up!
It's his Italian blood.
He gets so excited about that.
If I weren't here, you'd have had a bullet in your brain by now.
Fausto. I don't have a guilty conscience over you.
Or you.
Or anybody else, except maybe that German cop.
I came along as a driver, Ross.
When the killing started, that finished it.
Oh, come on now, Joe.
You must have realized.
It wasn't necessary to kill that cop.
But that nut over there, he enjoyed doing it.
The Mark of a good soldier, wouldn't you say, a man who enjoys killing?
You were a good soldier once, Joe.
Now, let's get down to business.
How much do you figure I owe you?
How much equals a pair of lungs?
Do I hear any bids?
I'll make an offer on your behalf.
One nice, comfortable seagoing boat.
Ship's papers all in order, with a name like leinad ii, for instance.
That's just about everything we've got in the world.
You know how much that boat costs?
Enough to balance the books.
Almost, anyway.
Yeah, well, you just forget it.
There's no deal.
Somehow, Joe, I don't think you're in much of a position to refuse us anything.
Ross...
Sooner or later, I'm gonna catch you with your guard down.
And you too.
I haven't forgotten everything you taught me.
No, I trained you well, but you forgot one thing, Joe.
Not much good to winning a war when you've lost your civilian population.
Or perhaps you don't care what happens to her.
The marriage has been kind of rocky lately, hasn't it?
Oh, no. You shouldn't believe all you heard down in the port.
Fishermen always exaggerate.
Where is it you want to go?
You'll find out later.
Tomorrow, just to see if you can go in and out without custom control,
I want you to take a small trip with katanga.
Very touching. But you don't have to worry. He'll be coming back.
We don't want anything to happen to him, not with the cargo he might be carrying.
Ah, now...
Now it's beginning to make sense.
- Why you want my boat, I mean.
- It's a matter of trust.
I knew that given the right circumstances,
I could land you.
You don't trust me enough to tell me what's in the cargo, huh?
No, it's a vicious circle. I don't trust you. Katanga doesn't trust us.
He won't hand over the cargo till he's been paid.
Just don't know you, and so...
It's the world we live in.
Anyway, the money should be here by the time you get back.
Now, fausto, don't you forget to go pick up moira at the airport, swissair from Geneva.
If that crazy broad ever makes the plane.
Oh, she'll be there.
So far everything's worked out perfectly.
In fact, with military precision.
Including Vermont?
You allow for casualties in any operation.
Yeah, well, suppose I say, uh, no more casualties and I don't go along with it?
Telephone's right there.
You can always call the police.
- Joe.
- Commissariat.
For god's sake, please, don't do it.
Hello?
La police here. Pass your message.
- Captain.
- Morning.
- Morning, herr captain.
- Good morning.
I'm sorry, but there's been a mistake in the booking.
This gentleman has the boat this morning.
- But was ist das?
- But, Joe...
Violet, get another boat.
Call Pierre or...
Somebody.
Come, dear.
Very pretty girl.
Eh?
The little German girl. She's very pretty.
Too bad we can't bring her on board for you.
You just worry about your women.
Where to?
Out there.
Cast off.
Why don't you put that away.
You're liable to hurt yourself.
Mind telling me where I'm going?
Like you are. Just going.
Hello, Joe!
Like the captain said, you seem to have it made.
Seven years.
Don't remind me.
What's it like in a German prison?
You're on the inside looking out.
There's a lot of ocean out there! Which part do you wanna try first?
Head for the iles de lérins.
And no funny business.
Katanga, I wanna explain something to you.
As long as you're holding my wife,
I can't call the police and I can't do anything about you, so put that thing away.
But if any harm should come to her, god help you.
God help you all.
There she is. Turkish flag.
Oh, yeah.
Turkish flag means she's smuggling opium.
Probably already processed into heroin.
- You read the wrong sort of books.
- I get around.
That's what I heard.
Never thought I'd see you with a wife and daughter.
Stepdaughter.
Twelve years old.
Interesting age.
You say you are michéle's father?
Well, uh, stepfather, yes.
Then I am really confused.
I know your wife.
She was here half an hour ago.
- She was what?
- She and her husband.
She said they wanted to take michéle home for the 14th of July celebration.
- You're sure?
- Of course I am.
Can you identify yourself?
After all, I don't know you.
What did my wife's husband look like?
Well...
Never mind, never mind. Thank you.
All right now, whose turn was it? Elizabeth?
Monsieur, s'il vous plait?
Problem? Talk to my colleague.
- It's always the same old story.
- Hello.
- The plane's an hour late.
- Someone's left an attaché case sitting on the floor right outside the locker room.
The name on it is fausto gelardi.
- Do you have the...
- No, I don't have it, but I think you ought to have him paged, otherwise somebody might pick it up.
Worse than women at losing things.
Will Mr. fausto gelardi please go down to the cloakroom.
We have found your attaché case.
Will Mr. fausto gelardi please go down to the cloakroom.
We have found your attaché case.
Your attention, please.
Estimated time of arrival: 10:15...
Moira?
Hi.
Here, let me help you with that.
Thought fausto was meeting me.
Well, he got nailed going through a traffic light.
I left him sitting there arguing with a cop.
Some mafioso.
He'll make a great godfather.
Sure that's not too heavy for you?
No, thank you. I can manage.
Okay. Car's right outside.
Well, how long have you known Ross?
Three months. He hid out at my place when he split jail.
He must have a lot of confidence in you.
He's knows I'm not the worldly type.
I've always had money.
Takes more than that to turn me on.
What does turn you on?
Freedom to do what I like.
To smoke what I like. To ball who I like.
Even to kill if I have to. Like Ross.
No wonder he finds you simpatico.
Men usually do.
Enough to marry you?
Ah!
Wow! Are you out of your skull?
Now, look. I had enough of that back home.
Mummy and daddy, enemies to the night, right?
But always deadly polite in front of the children.
Beautiful. Like two dogs with their teeth in each other's throats.
- How long have you known Ross?
- Oh, years.
We did time together.
Imagine, putting a man of his talents in prison.
That's what did him in, his talents.
No.
He was betrayed, let down by a friend.
Well, there are some people in this world who are just no good.
What's that you're smoking?
- Want one?
- No chance!
No chance.
- Is this the way to beaulieu?
- Yep.
Ross said he had some unfinished business there with that friend.
That's been taken care of.
Did he kill him?
- Not yet.
- But he will.
That seems to be the general idea.
I've never seen a man killed.
Ah, it's a barrel of laughs.
We just passed a sign saying "grass."
Grass? Oh, yeah, yeah. Grasse.
Where are we going now?
Oh, this is a shortcut.
We might save about 15 minutes.
You're not gonna try any funny business?
No. Not unless you force me.
I don't want to go this way.
Why not?
I think you'd better take me back to the main road.
What for?
Well, I don't want to go bumping around some unknown little dirt road.
And why do you have that?
You turn this car around, do you hear me?
You just sit back and relax.
I know who you are.
Okay. Everybody out.
Come on, come on, come on.
- What are you gonna do with me?
- Not what I'd like to.
I haven't got the time.
- Oh, god.
- Here we are.
I don't...
Just make yourself at home, baby.
Let me help you.
You're not gonna leave me here?
Only until my wife and daughter are safe.
- Let me have that.
- Oh, no!
You bastard! You think Ross will let you stop sweating that easily?
It depends on how badly he wants his money or you.
Whichever he loves more.
What if I'm here for weeks?
- He'll think you're bluffing.
- He might.
- Ooh!
- I could take him a handful of hair, but I think this'll be more convincing.
Ooh. Look at that.
Come on.
Here, amuse yourself and count that.
You bastard! You can't leave me here!
You filthy creep!
Bastard!
You come back here, you!
You creep, you bastard, you come back here!
You can't leave me here!
Bastard!
Come back, you big bastard!
Come back!
Never learn, will you?
Hold it!
Michéle upstairs?
Yeah. She's all right.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Hey.
Aw, come on. You're wasting your time.
I'm not about to endanger the civilian population.
He's not the one that'll start the shooting.
I could have brought either that or a handful of hair.
Ross, I think you ought to marry that girl. She's crazy about you.
- Crazy anyhow.
- Where is she?
In a safe place.
She's scared to death.
A lot of little crawling things around, and she's crying her heart out.
- But she's all right.
- What did you have in mind?
We make a trade.
You know, the way I've got her hid, might be three, four weeks before anybody came along, and all she's got to eat is money.
If we let your wife and daughter go?
You get moira, the money, and if you still want it, a free boat ride.
- It's a trade.
- Get michéle.
Fausto, go with her.
Just a minute. We need two boat rides.
One to pick up the stuff from the turkish boat, and the other is all yours.
That's how it'll be.
Still playing games with the mafia, huh, Ross?
You know any better way of making ten times your investment?
- Papa!
- Everything's gonna be okay now.
Ready whenever you are.
You two stay close to me.
You stay close to them, katanga.
Slow down.
You getting seasick?
Don't worry.
We'll get you back to camp soon.
You think this is the place?
I think... it better be.
- Slow down.
- Okay.
So, where's moira?
What's the matter? Don't you trust me?
Last time I trusted you cost me seven years.
- Down there?
- Maybe.
I don't know why I should trust you.
Ross, I want you to let my wife and daughter leave in that car.
Then we'll finish making the trade.
You still have me.
Okay.
Katanga, stay with us now.
And what about them?
He'll take us to it.
- It's yours to lose.
- Somebody has to trust somebody.
- Are you sure this is what you want?
- Yeah, it's what I want.
It's a silly thing to say, but be careful.
Yeah.
Help! Let me out! Help!
Let me out of here!
Help!
Hold it!
You all right, darling?
And you've killed fausto, you clumsy bastard!
Get me to that car.
- Let me out of here! Help!
- Quick. Oh.
Help! Let me out of here!
Help!
Help!
- Let me out of here!
- Get out.
Come on, you.
Give me a hand.
Hey, kid, let me out of here.
Go open the door.
Where's Ross?
Wait till I tell him...
Easy. Easy.
God, what happened?
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Not me. One of yours.
Moira, whiskey in the car.
Stomach wound. You shouldn't drink.
Shut up! Go get it.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
It's been a long while since I had orders given by a woman.
Get going.
Bring it to my mouth.
Daddy, can't we all go home?
You stay close to your mother.
Do everything she says.
With a hole like that, you're not gonna last long, Ross.
Oh, what else is new?
You need a doctor right now.
I can't stop the bleeding.
How far is the nearest doctor?
Half an hour.
You'd better soak that in whiskey first.
It's a half hour to grasse.
But today's July 14th.
Might be a lot of traffic.
Captain, he's trying to con you into something.
You can get me there in 30 minutes?
That's not what I said.
Hmm? What are you talking about?
I'm saying that if...
If you move him, he'll bleed to death before he gets there.
He's lying.
Moira can take you.
If you want me to.
Sure, you go right ahead, moira.
You'll get there just in time for the doctor to sign a death certificate.
Ross, the only thing you can do is bring the doctor here.
He's out of his mind, captain.
No. Looks like Joe's right.
You mean, a doctor to come here?
Here's where I am.
Hmph. It's crazy, captain.
We'll have to wait...
Till late tonight.
- Then I'll take you to a doctor.
- Katanga, try to understand what I'm about to say.
May not be easy for you, but make a supreme effort.
This is a stomach wound.
Stomach wounds bleed internally.
I know what's a wound in the gut.
But do you know how many pints of blood a man has?
He has ten pints, and mine is pumping out slowly but steadily at an estimated rate of four pints per hour.
Therefore, in another hour,
I shall lose consciousness and finally check out.
And you, in your wondrous stupidity, stand there and suggest
I wait until late tonight.
Ah.
Maybe I am stupid.
Stupid enough to know we should kill these...
And cut out now!
Those who can.
Listen to me, you...
Get it for me.
The money.
Quickly!
There, enough to buy yourself two doctors. And an undertaker!
Good-bye, captain. Good-bye, sir.
Drop the schmeisser.
Now the money.
Kick the schmeisser over here, Joe.
Check him over.
Now, in case...
My gun is pointed at your heirless unmarried daughter.
Ross, I think you better let me get you that doctor.
I guess the longer we waltz around here, the more blood I lose.
Yeah, moira. You go too.
Pick up that gun.
Don't hesitate to use it if you have to.
It'll be a pleasure.
Please, let him take the child with him. Please.
Sure, let them all go.
We'll just sit here holding hands.
Wife and daughter stay.
Joe knows if he cries "cops" he won't have any wife and daughter when he comes back.
Just two statistics.
You have to go. We have only one chance.
You take care of your mother till I come back, okay?
Okay - Joe?
You realize I'm the sole protector of mother and child?
I realize.
Good. I'll be here.
I'll be around for the next 60 minutes.
That is till 4:27.
After that...
You forgot something.
Well, don't just stand there. Get in.
Well, I didn't want to make any wrong moves.
Ow!
Oh!
No noise.
Now, get in the car.
Get in, or I'll give you one of these. Get in.
In front.
Nice car your friends got.
I'm gonna need two hands to drive it. Here.
Please.
Captain!
You want this gun, katanga?
Come and get it.
Yeah, you prefer your old schmeisser.
Know something, captain? I can do that.
Not without putting on a lot of lead weight.
But I take you with me, captain, sir.
Even with a full clip in my gut.
I take you first.
And them. I've got time for them too.
Yes, you might at that.
Your move, katanga.
I can wait.
Me, I'm not bleeding inside.
And if you don't want to be, as you were.
On the floor, back against that wall.
As you like.
You.
I owe you a kind thought.
Captain, please. Give me the other gun.
Let me hold it.
I give you my word I won't use it on you.
I give my own word I won't leave you while you're still alive.
If something happens to you, at least we have a last chance.
Sure, give her the piece, captain, sir.
What's a piece between friends?
Guns. They're just not your scene.
Your job, make sure I stay awake.
- Make me some coffee, black.
- Okay.
- Hot, strong.
- Come on.
Go on, darling.
So...
Captain, if I have the gun, he can't go for both of us at once.
I told you. You couldn't kill a virus infection.
Killing him wouldn't be murder.
It would be like cleaning a cesspool.
You're tough.
It's in the family.
Get your tool kit. You're coming with me.
- It's an emergency.
- With that, you are going to make one.
Never mind the cracks. Move.
And what's the nature of this emergency?
- It's a bullet wound in the stomach.
- Exit wound?
- No.
- Long ago?
About 40 minutes.
Much external bleeding?
Doctor, you're stalling and there isn't time!
But I must know what to take!
Nurse! Nurse, hurry up!
Yes, doctor, what is it?
Six units of plasma, saline solution and hemostat.
- All right, doctor.
- Please do it quickly.
Hurry, hurry. Is that clock right?
Uh, yes.
There's only 27 more minutes to go.
Oh, thank you. Put it in my bag.
Give it to her. Hurry, hurry.
Do you want an ambulance?
We don't need an ambulance. We have a car.
But, but you have to phone immediately to Mr. roget.
- "Mister"? Don't you mean...
- You tell him... yes, yes.
Tell him I've canceled his appointment.
Tell him I'm out on an emergency!
Where can I reach you?
Mister?
Allo, la police?
Le commissaire roget, s'il vous plait.
Still trust your old army friend?
Still think he'll be back?
You'll see.
And with a doctor.
Why? Because of you and the kid?
When the kid isn't his?
Like he was worried about you when he killed Vermont and wouldn't let you call the police?
You must stay awake.
- Ah...
- Come on. Coffee. Hurry, hurry.
Joe and the doctor will be here any minute.
You mean you can still see your watch on your arm?
What time is it?
Our friends have exactly seven minutes left.
And how long have you got?
One minute to go, unless you were bluffing.
You should have listened to me.
You'd be all patched up by now.
And we could still do it.
Even now I could carry you to the road and flag down a car and get a doctor.
Don't listen to him.
He'll kill you that way.
Hmm. Keep using that word.
But anyway, in your army, they don't call it "killing."
"Waste them."
Hmm? Isn't that what you Americans say when you have prisoners you don't want to bother about?
I thought Joe was a good driver.
Sure, like last time.
He'll be here any minute now.
You just keep conscious.
How much time has he got left?
None. Time's up.
Do you know the police are following us?
The last five minutes.
Fasten your seat belt.
Faster!
Wait, don't move.
I have seen a lot of crazy drivers, but...
This is a number one bastard.
You won't drive it again soon.
With mad people like this around...
I'm not in a hurry to get back.
Can someone help me?
You are driving with your ambulance?
No, we drive with our hearse.
Son of a bitch!
You tried to kill me this time!
Thought I had gone already, huh?
Just couldn't wait.
You won't be with us for long, that's for sure.
Put that money back on the table.
Go on. Shoot me.
Then you're all alone. And I mean alone.
Keep it!
Captain, sir, you know how long he's been gone?
It's nearly five o'clock.
I'm tired of wait...
Wait...
- Keep awake!
- What?
Keep awake!
Don't fall... oh, god.
- I am not in any hurry.
- Captain Ross?
I can hear someone coming.
Listen. It's Joe and a doctor.
Hmm?
All I can hear is pump, pump...
The blood squirtin' out between my fingers.
Stay awake.
Stay awake!
Stay awake!
That Joe sure fell on his feet.
You're quite a... lady.
He'll be here any moment now.
But I'll be...
But you'll be here.
Not if you have any sense, you won't.
You want me to write you a letter?
What do you think you're playing at?
They're going nowhere.
Neither are you. I need you to drive.
Drive you where? To a cemetery?
If you do, you'll stay there with me.
Aaah!
Come on!
Now. Come on.
I can't go. It's twisted.
- Just a little bit more now.
- But I'm tired.
Come on. We've got to keep going. Come on.
Halt!
Stay where you are!
Don't move, or I shoot the kid first!
I guess the wind's in our favor.
- Quick, the lighter.
- What?
Light the grass. Yes.
Light the grass. Light the grass.
Run! Quick! Run!
Stay where you are!
Up there!
That's a good girl.
Come on. Get out.
Come on. Hurry. He's down here.
Joe! Help!
Joel oh, Joe. Joe.
Oh, thank god.
Thank god.
- Joe!
- Don't move! Stay where you are!
Easy, now!
One burst would cut them in half!
Now, throw your gun on the ground!
It was empty anyway.
Now I want to see how good a captain you are with them aboard.
The boat. Remember?
Oh!
Oh.
Oh.
It's bastille day. We forgot to celebrate.
Out. Quickly!
Don't do anything stupid.
Who wants his little balloon?
Yes, it is this one.
All right, where we going?
Same place as we were going this morning.
Only this time, I intend to get there with or without your family.
Oh, yeah. The boat with the turkish flag.
Is that the new pickup point for heroin in these parts?
- What happens after we get you there?
- You think too far ahead.
Enjoy the moment.
Life is short.
And shorter for some than for others.
You're gonna have to come back, you know.
Can't make it to Algiers without picking up more fuel.
Algiers? Not me.
They'd cut off my legs with a rusty knife.
And not a minute too soon.
Gonna stay on that boat?
What you really want to know is when do I put you over the side?
One likes to know these things, yeah.
And even if I told you, you'd still go on driving me, right up to the last minute.
Because there is always hope.
Be careful.
Hey, Joe!
Is that the way you celebrate, working?
The wife wanted some fresh air!
You call that working?
Don't call that celebrating either!
See you!
They know you.
They know you don't celebrate with your own wife.
The girl, how old did you say she was?
She's about 11.
Eleven? You said 12 before.
What's that got to do with him?
He thinks you're something special.
On that we agree.
Katanga, tell me something.
What?
Do you have children of your own?
You seem to think it's very funny.
Not that it matters, but were you ever married?
Do I look married?
I wouldn't know.
You don't have to look any special way, if you ask me.
What are you doing there?
Uh, my legs are tired.
How about getting a chair?
Don't want you too comfortable.
You might fall asleep.
Katanga, won't you let us go once you've boarded the turkish boat?
We can't hurt you when you sail off.
Michéle, move!
I guess I'd better go to the police about Vermont.
Hmm.
Either that, or wait for them to come looking for me.
Would they put you in jail for that?
Who knows?
We're lucky they didn't catch michéle and me.
For what?
Starting forest fires.
Ah, monsieur, is this your car?
No, but I'd like to talk to you about something else.
No, not before I've caught the maniac who drove this car.
'Cause if it's the last thing I do, I'm going to see that he gets six months.
Six months?
Yes. Six months!
Six months.
I'm hungry.
I am hungry.
And I'm hungry.
Tell you a story, and it's a true one
And I'll tell it like you'll understand
And I ain't gonna talk like some history man
I look out and I see a land
Young and lovely, hard and strong
For fifteen thousand years we've danced her praises
Payed our thanks and we've just begun
This, this is my country
Young and growin' free and flowin', sea to sea
Yes, this is my country
Ripe and bearing miracles in every pond and tree
I can stand upon a hill at dawn
Look all around me, feel her surround me
Soldier Blue, can't you see her life has just begun?
It's beating inside us, telling us she's here to guide us
Ooh, Soldier Blue,
Soldier Blue
Can't you see that there's another way to love her?
Yes, this is my country
I sprang from her and
I'm learnin' how to count upon her
Tall trees and the corn is high country
Yes, I love her and
I'm learnin' how to take care of her
Ooh, Soldier Blue,
Soldier Blue
Can't you see that there's another way to love her?
Soldier Blue... Soldier Blue...
Can't you see that there's another way to love her?
Stupid frilly hat!
Honus...
Hey, Honus!
- Did you see 'em?
Did you see the shape of them boobs?
Well?  Well, where is she?
Where's the woman?
Ah... What the devil?
Who put here in there?
She's yours Captain, you've got her
Bitch!
- Detail...
Forward, ho!
- Look at her, settin' in there...
Two years captive with them red bucks...
Don't it make you wonder though?
- What?
How many of 'em got to her...
Don't it get you all worked up?
Wade...sometimes you talk like a pervert...
- Me?
It's not her fault the Cheyenne grabbed her...
Well, I'm not sayin' it is, but...
...by guff...
I'd sure like to get my hands on some of that...
- You can keep your hands to yourself when we get to Fort Reunion...
- Why?
- He's waiting for her there...
- Who?
Her financée...
Spingarn!
Spingarn!
We need flankers...
- Sir?
You ought to put out some flankers.
Are you advising me Captain?
Me?
Huh?
I'm only the Pay Master...
You get no 'advice' from me soldier.
I'm telling you... put out some flankers.
(chortles) What're you afraid of Sir?
Road agents?
Cheyenne!
(chortles) Excuse me Cap'n, but I ain't heard yet about no Injuns comin' after a Pay Master's detail.  
...they got no use for that money chest.
- Flankers!
Yes Sir.
Get...
All right... I guess we're out far enough.
- Why pick on us?
Why not?
- Just getting up real close...
...you can almost see her...
...you could take your hand... and you could put it right around...
... one of her pretty little ankles.
You could Honus...
...an' you're a snot nose...
You're a good friend... the best friend I ever had... but you're snot nosed and you always will be...
Willie!
Take cover!
Take cover!
Spingarn...
...you stupid son of a bitch...
Dismount!
Take cover and fire at will...
Oh, my God...
Lieutenant, the woman... the woman!
- Get up.
Stupid... cocking... murdering bastards...
Imbeciles...
...the American....
...fire you...
...now I advise you to try to control...
...I told you...
Oh my God... we're the last...
We can treat with them...
What?
-White flag!
...talk to them...
...we can make 'em listen!
- Captain, those bloody butchers want nothing more than our hides.
I'm gonna talk to them...
I'm gonna talk to them...
Captain... come back here!
- You Indians... No Kill...
No kill...
Aiii!
Iaiii!
Fire! ...Fire!
...woods are on fire...
Fire!
...won't take 'em long now...
Hey!
Hey, up here...
...come on!
Come on!
Well, don't just stand there...
Get your ass up here!
Gee...
You it!   
- What?
You all that's coming?
- I don't know...
Well, follow me!
Wait!
Hey!  Get down...
...come on...
- Well, there goes the wagon...
They'll be looking for us.
Nah.
Not for long.
Not him!
Not who?
Spotted Wolf!
In case you didn't know what hit you, they're Cheyenne...
How can you tell it's Spotted Wolf?
I saw him.
You know him by sight?
I know him.
What's your name?
Honus Gent.
Cresta Maribel Lee.
Are you wounded there?
- What?
Are you wounded?
- Oh? .. No... that's not my blood
Good 'cause we've got a long wait.
They are gonna be messin' with those bodies down there for hours.
Ah, what do you doing?
- I'm takin' off my pants.
- Why?
'Cause it's hotter than hell an' they're ichin'... 
Oh...
Ahh... We'd better take it easy...
...get comfortable...(sighs)
I sure as hell wish
I hadn't lost my hat.
Ah...
Miss?
Huh?
...about Spotted Wolf? how do you?  ah...
I'm his wife...
Oh...
Hey, look here,...
...come on....
Hey what're you doing there?
...nothing...
Look, I don't want to rush you soldier, but it's going to be dark in a couple of hours...
...and we can't hang around here.
You're... you're robbing the dead...
My God...
You're robbing the dead!
Yep!  Well I sure as hell ain't getting much.
A little hard tack mostly, but that'll keep...
...us going for a while...
You find anything better?
My God...
...it was you...
- Me?
He was looking for you!
- What the hell are you talking about?
Spotted Wolf...
He was out to bring you back.
Bull shit!
- The Cheyennes would..
What? 
- You heard me.  I've nothing to do with it.
- The Cheyennes would never attack a Pay Master's detail...
Bull shit!
He was looking for you!
- Ah, he wouldn't trouble himself...
Don't flatter me, Soldier Blue...
 I'm not worth any chest of gold.
They've got no use for gold.
Well, what the hell do you think they were fighting with?
Rifles cost money, see... and if you don't believe me...
...then try and find the pay chest... go ahead... find it!
...any more questions?
I want to say something...
- Yea? well hang on to it,  we're leaving...
For them!
Huh?
Something must be said for them.
You mean a kind of service, huh?
Ah, what the hell; go ahead.
Should be a prayer.
- Right! ... A prayer...  
I bet you know a hundred prayers.
I should be here.
Huh?
I should be here, lying with them, with my company.
Why?  I mean, you've come out pretty good it seems to me.  See...
...they're all lying here dead, and you're still walking.
Murdering savages...
- Yeh, you go right ahead.
You can howl at the moon if you want to, but it's not going to get us back to Fort Reunion.
Now, you say your something, or let's get the hell out of here.  
Theirs not to make reply,
Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs but to do and die,
Into the valley of Death 
Rode the six hundred,
- Storm'd at with shot and shell,
- Boldly they rode and well,
Into the jaws of...
...of Death,
Into the mouth of Hell
Rode the six hundred.
Flash'd all their sabres bare,
Flash'd as they turn'd in air,
Charging an army, while
 All the world wonder'd:
Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs but to do and die:
Into the valley of Death
 Rode the six hundred.
Jesus.
- Throw them out.
What?
Your socks.
Why do you bother? 
Here...
What's the matter?
It's mud!
- It's a little dirty...
Where's the canteen?
- Oh, no...
You're not gonna' touch something that was robbed from the dead, are you?
All right...
... we might be needing them later.
- That's using your head Soldier Blue.
Would you like some more mud?
Isn't it...
Can't you do something with that dress?
- Huh?
Can't you ... pull it together some way?
Couple of days, I'll lose a few pounds...
I won't be showin' through so much...
Uh - it never did fit me anyway... one of hers...
- Whose?
...that woman at the Snake Flats agency...
Right off, she stripped me down naked....
...stuck me in a tub, and gave me this here dress.
Hey!... Hey, did you see the hat?
Big bright yellow hat she gave me... covered my whole face.
- I did love that hat, though.
I'm sick at heart about losin' that...
- sick at heart...
You can say that now!
What's the matter?
What'd I say
21 men lying dead back there and you sit here mourning a yellow hat.
...21 men!
- A drop in the old bucket.
- A what?
It's not the army, Soldier Blue...
 They're not the ones getting killed off...
...in this damn fool country...
- Our country, Miss Lee, is neither damned or foolish...
Balls!
Mrs. Lee, you have a most profane way of speaking...
- You should hear me in Cheyenne.  Do you want to?
- No!
...good brave lads comin' out here to kill themselves a real live injun...
...puttin' up their forts in a country they've got no claim to...
So what the hell do you expect the indians to do?
Sit back on their butts...
...while the army take's over their land
- You saw for yourself what they did, taking off scalps...
Yea, and who taught them that little trick? 
The white man!
...and cutting off hands and cutting off feet and cutting off...
I know what they cut off, but at least they don't make tobacco pouches out of them...
...uhah... that's something else you soldier boy's made up...
- You're lying.
You ever seen an Indian camp after the army's been there?
Huh?  You ever see the women and what was done to them before they where killed?
Ever see the little boys and girls stuck on the long knifes?
Huh?
Stuck and dying?
 WelI, I have.
Fine.
Go to sleep.
You're lying.
(singing) My true love sleeps o'er the hillside...
Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey...
(singing) My true love sleeps o'er the hillside...
Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey...
(singing) Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey...
A few more jumps and I'll be with him...
Hey, ho...
I'll tell you about that hat...
...that hat was just like the one my Daddy gave me...
...on a Sunday morning a long time ago, he knelt down and he kissed me...
...then he put that hat on my head.
That's the last I ever saw of him.
- You mean he died?
Hell no, he ran off and left me...
...put me in an orphanage on Canal Street.
Eh... what the hell.
Whoever asked to get themselves born anyway... huh?  Who?
I'm going a sleep.
- You do that soldier...
...and you try to keep your mind off me...
Miss Lee, I certainly have at no...
- Oh, I know...
If you get too all-fired horny during the night...
...just, ah... go soak your head in the stream over there.
(singing) My true love sleeps o'er the hillside...
Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey...
(singing) My true love sleeps o'er the hillside...
Hey, ho, tiddle-um-dey...
Well...
That's it...
Over there...
What?
- The old Garvey wagon road.
Oh, what about it?
- We'll be sticking close to it.
Why?
- Well it's a straight shoot right into Fort Reunion...
...Maybe, uh, four days at the most
There we are, right out there in the open... and there they come...
...a-whooping it, out of nowhere.
They'll have us hanging feet high, and let the crows pluck out our eyes.
You may not be aware, Miss Cresta Lee,
...but I'm a professional soldier, and I happen to be well experienced in this part of the country
How long have they kept you private, Private...
No one's kept me, Miss Lee.
It was my father's wish...
You take that road, Soldier Blue, and you'll get your father coming out here to bury you.
My father's dead.
He was killed at Little Big Horn, last year...
...murdered by the Sioux...
I wonder if that General Custer took your father's advice...
...well, it's a sure thing I ain't takin' yours...
Listen, you keep the rifle...
...the jerky you can have, just give me some of this hard tack...
There, there we are...
...good luck, Soldier Blue,
I'll tell them at the Fort it wasn't my fault...
Hey, Private Gent!
Miss Lee!
Well... get lost?
- Couldn't do it!
Huh?
- Leaving you all alone...
I couldn't forgive myself... if something happened to you.
Well... thank you!
Heh!
What could I say to your financée...
Oh!
You know about him, huh?
How could I face him?
How could I look him in the eye?
Yeh, I see....
A soldier's duty for another soldier, and to hell with me.
A matter of principle, Miss Lee....
It's a matter of crap.
Have some berries...
Berries make me sick.
Well, Christ...
Naah!
Look at that, another rip.
God dammit.
Do you talk in front of him that way?
- Who?
Your fiancée?
Huh!
That's a funny thing, you know...
We don't talk.
I can't remember one conversation we ever had...
He'd just grab hold... and I'd hold off, and...
Thank goodness I held off long enough...
So he, uh, joined the army...
Boy, that did it....
...six long months at Fort Reunion, and no women...
I was sent for, to come out and have a military wedding.
Here I am, still trying to get there.
You sure he's still waiting?
- He said so in the telegraph.
The way you put it, well...
...Uh... A person gets the idea you're marrying him for money.
Yeh, I am!
Lose something?
My sock.
- Awww.
It's gone!
- I'll tell you soldier...
It's gonna cut your washing in half.
I'm going back a way...
- You're not!
It won't take but a moment...
I promise I won't report you for being out of uniform.
Jesus Christ...
A hundred miles ahead of us, and you're going back... back!
What the hell am I doing...
Twenty-one soldiers, and I get you!
Don't touch it.
Don't you lay a finger on that rifle!  You hear me?
It's hidden there under the jacket...
You just let it stay like that...
Cheyenne?
-  Kiowa!
Oh!
- And they want to kill us, but not too quick...
Where'd they come from...
- From one lousy sock.
Well, we've got to do something.
- You can watch...
What're you talking about?
They're going to rape me Soldier Blue... and then they're gonna kill us afterwards.
Oh, my God!
Did I see you?
- I spit..
Well, how could you?
- Ssshhh...
What;s going on?
- I insulted them...
Oh no!
I told them they were five old women...
...I said that they were afraid of you...
...that you were tall and strong and feared nothing...
You...
Wait... don't pick it up... take off your clothes...
...Not me!  Look at him, Soldier Blue.
He can move twice as fast as you can...
 ...in those stupid army pants.
Take 'em off!
I can't fight my long johns...
Take them of too!
He can hold you with them.
Look, it's my life as well as yours...
You want to kill us both? ... Take them off!
I can't!
- Take 'em off!
No!
- You bastard!
Shut up!
- Kill him!
You've won.
They expect you to kill him.
Hey Honus!
You did it!
You did it!
Honus!
- Hey, Honus... wait for me!
Honus!
- Honus...
Wait up!
Wha... what're you doing?
I'm freezing my ass off...
You... you can't sleep here.
Why not?
Well... I'm here...
Turn over and close your eyes, we'll be warm in no time.
Honus what're you doing?
(sighs) I can't!
You can't what?
I can't do it.
What do you want to do, Honus?
Oh man...
Take it! You take it...
I want the rifle Honus...
What for?
It's a goat..
What?
...honest to God, it is a real live goat...
Now don't argue with me... give me the rifle
I want to see for myself...
Oh, no... Honus!
Give me that rifle...
- sshh, you'll scare him...
He can hear is and you're gonna miss him by three hills...
I'll get him...
- You'll miss him...
I'll get him...
He's gone...
Look, you dumb gun soldier... he's gone.
You stupid, beardless, tenderfoot!
I hope you choke on berries...
Do you hear me? I hope you throw up all night.
Owwww!
- Miss Lee...
- Cresta...
Brain shot... dead on.
- Oh, oh Honus...
It's beautiful...
Oh, Honus...
I've got to tell you the truth, Honus...
He was a tough old bastard...
Please, I've asked you not to...
- All right, all right, I'm sorry.
It's not that I'm a prude or anyth...
- Oh, I know you're not, Honus... 
I've really gotta be more careful.
Well, I guess it's time we turned in.
Honus...
 ...it's stupid...
...you over there, and me over here...
Honus?
All right, I guess you're right.
Honus...
...will you be all right...
I mean...
I know what you mean...
- Will you?
I'll make it... some how...
Listen, I'll try not to move much...
That'll help.
- I will...
...smells like rain...
Well, there isn't a cloud in the sky.
'Night, Honus.
Good night, Miss Lee.
Shut up! 
It's a white man's fire...
How do you know? 
It's different from a red man's fire...
Oh.
Gosh Almighty!
I hope you'll forgive the intrusion sir...
I'm Private Honus Gent, of the Calorado 11th Cavalry...
 Lord, declare...
...and uh...
...this young lady is Miss 
Cresta Lee, from New York City...
So 'tis, so 'tis...
- We're trying to get to Fort Reunion.
You see, uh... my troop was wiped out by the Cheyenne... 
Devils... Devils...
- It was a Pay Master's escort... 
...and Miss Lee had joined us to meet her Fiancée...
Good... hah... good for you...
...yeh...
Where is your guns?
Guns?
- Guns... you're the hunting type?
Oh no...
Uh, we lost our rifle in the flood...
Hey!  That was a ripple, wasn't it?
Come near drownin' my two beauties, there...
They been 16 years with Isaac Cumber.
Huh... Heh...
I'm pleased to meet you Mr. Cumber...
Isaac Q... the Q part was my daddy's joke...
...being as he calls me Cumber...
...sayin' Q Cumber...
...but I kinda like it...
...(laughs)...
Oh.
That's a... quite a wagon...
...you... travel in style
Yeh, I do, ah, I surely do...
I got grub and tools and blankets and, ah, bolts of calico...
...just in case...
- In case of Indians, huh?
Take a look...
Take a look in these eyes, Soldier.
That's honesty you see there...
...hard rock honesty!
I treats 'em fair, and I treats 'em square...
...and they don't fool none with Isaac Q!
- What about hostiles?
Hostiles!  'Ya think I trade with hostiles? 
Devils...
Devils...
Hey, you look kinda' peek'd, Missy...
You don't talk much, huh?
Well, that's alright...
A man would rather look at a woman than...
...talk to her, any day, and you... uh...
I can see more of you right now...
...than I seen of my wife in 27 years...
...God rest her soul...
...her frosty-faced soul.
We could use some food, Mr. Cumber.
- Yea, you could, you surely could.
I'm ah... I'm partial to rabbit, myself.
That'd be fine.
If you don't mind,
I could use some of your calico.
Help yourself...
...in back of the wagon 
Are we met?
- What?
I get the feeling we met...
- No, I don't think so.
In my rucksack, help yourself, good lye soap... you can, uh, scrub each other off, or, uh...
...whatever else you have a mind to...
Are you sure you haven't met him before?
- I'm sure!
Think about it...
- Why?
...because there's something wrong.
- What?
I don't know...
- the man's a Devil, right?
...he's a pots trader, right?
- Yeh, is something wrong?
...pots traders don't go out looking for gold...
...and especially not in Indian country...
- So he wants to get rich quick...
...who doesn't?
- Well, uh, I still think...
Oh no! Please don't think!
Not now!
We have got food and a nice warm fire...
- What if he... uh...
Wait a minute...
How do we know you didn't meet through Spotted Wolf's camp?
He doesn't trade with hostile Devils...
- That could be it...
...trading with the Cheyenne....
- Bolts of cloth?
I mean guns...
Rifles...
Well, there's the wagon...
Go look for 'em... 
- Ah... eh!
- 'Ya like it?
It's different.
Boy Honus, you sure know how to flatter a girl...
'Must be a born gift...
They must be hidden somewhere else!
...you know the type tal...
 - Here...
What?
 - Take a bath. 
Listen to me... that old man is trading off rifles for the pay cheques we had...
Honus, if I'm gonna look different, you might as well smell different... now take the soap...
...maybe it's got a false bottom...
I'm going to take a look...
- No!
...right now, before he get's back...
- No!
Oh, get out of my way...
Honus, you've got no right...
Get down!
Get off me!
Stop it!
You've known it all along...
The rifles are inside...
...and you have met him before...
Twice...
...selling guns!
Yes.
...to the Cheyenne...
- Yes!
...to kill American soldiers... 
...and you wouldn't stop him?
I couldn't then...
...I wouldn't now!
What?
For your own people?
Most people I know live in New York City...
For your country then...
- Whose country then?
This isn't my country ...
...we're in Indian country.
OK... 
Why?
Tell me, why did you ever leave the Cheyenne?
All right... you really want know?
Because they tallk different ... 
...they dress different... 
...and they eat different...
...because I am not a Cheyenne, Solider Blue, and I never will be... 
...but I can tell you right now that I'd rather be one...
...than any rump butt soldier... of any blood thirsty army you can name!
You're a traitor, Miss Lee.
Well... at least that's settled!
Cresta?
Got a good look, did you?
I thought you would.
Where is she?
Clunkered!  Got her with my rifle butt...
...over there, by the fire.
Don't worry soldier...
She ain't marked now and that won't show a bit.
(Cumber singing) I've got a heart full of love
For every star in the sky,
(Cumber singing) I've got a heart full of love
For every bird on the wing,
(Cumber singing) I've got a heart full of love
For every bird that can sing,
(Cumber singing) 'Tellin' you, I've got a heart full of love
That wants to get up and fly...
(Cresta) Bite it...
(Honus) What?
(Cresta) Use your teeth...
(Cresta) Not there!
(Cresa) Honus?
(Cresta) What're you doing?
(Cresta) Oww!
(Honus) Sorry!
(Cresta) Never mind... keep at it!
(Honus) Are you all right?
(Cresta) Eww!
(Cresta) Eeww!
Look at it, would ya!
Nature's wonderland. (chortles)
Out here I feel I'm close to the great secret of life itself.
Honest to God, ah...
I get sort of choked up inside...
- Maggot!
Eh... what?
I called you a Maggot!
A maggot?
Heh, heh!
Maggot!
Huh, the tiniest creature in God's universe...
...and which one of us is any better?
You? Me? Him?
I wouldn't count on it.
There's only one thing certain right now Missy...
...pretty soon you're gonna be back in the arms of your loved one, and...
...you can bet ol' Spotted Wolf is gonna be just a-itchin' to get his hands on you...
Are you planning to starve us for...
If I know Spotted Wolf, he's gonna want somethin' real plump to get his hands on...
Hah, Hah, how about it Missy?
What about a juicy rump steak?  Huh?
Heh, heh... ought to be a young pronghorn around here somewheres...
...heh, heh...
You got any sweet nothin's left, soldier, you'd better say 'em now. (chortles)
Quick! Come on, get at 'em!
- I can't!
Why not?
- I haven't got any spit left to chew with...
Chew dry!
Come on!
That's it!
Come on!
It's coming, I can feel it!
A little harder... 
Pull!
Pull!
Good!
Come on Honus!
It's coming...
Pull!
A little...
I got it Honus!
Give me your feet, soldier...
- What?
I'll cut your feet loose, but that's all...
Then we get right out of here.
What about the guns?
They stay where they are.
You're going to let him bring those guns in now, when you know what they will be used for?
I'm giving the Cheyenne something to keep them alive...
Nobody's going to murder them.  They'll be given land, a place to live in peace...
Bull shit!
Cut me loose!
Cut me loose.
Not your hands, just your feet.
He's got the only saddle...
...we'll have to ride out bareback...
What the hell are you doing?
What do you want? A medal?
Come on!
Get up!
Get up!
Get the horse!
Ahh!
-Honus?
Honus!
Come on, get up here.
You can make it.
Ride!  Go on, get out of here...
- Get up here you son of a bitch....
Get up boy!
Get up!
Giah!
Look...ooh.
Oh, eh!
Get up!
Get up!
Honus we gotta to keep going.
Honus, he's following us.
Hang on, dammit...
Hang on!
Whoa, come back here, come on back...
Wait!
Honus, shut up...
...for God's sake...
Shut up, dammit! (groaning)
How's your leg?
Still moves!
You're lucky...
That bullet went clean through. it's my, ah, head that hurts.
- Oh?
Here... I want you to eat some of these...
It'll make you feel better.
It's good... What is it?
Have some more....
I chewed up some roots and packed them right there, in your wound...
It kills the poison.
Big 'Injun medicine, you know...
Wouldn't think your everyday savage would have time for medicine, would you?
No, I guess not...
Anyway, you're lookin' um... pretty good now, Honus.
How about you?
Me?
Oh, ah...
Here, have some more of this.
Hah, you haven't told me what it is...
Hocheeka....
It's snake...
Snake?
You've got to cook it just right...
I bet you do...
So...
You look....
...better than I've ever seen you before...
...you look all... shiny and... and beautiful...
...like an angel...
Cresta...
What the hell you doing?
God, what was in that snake...
No...
It's not the snake...
You've got your fever back...
- No...
Hey!  Look at me...
I'm a traitor, remember?
Uh huh... I know...
And for God's sake, look at the way I swear all the time....
That's true...
Well...
Well, how the hell... how can you tell...
- I'd rather not tell you anything...
Huh?
I'd rather hold you, Cresta Maribel Lee...
Damn...
Cresta...
Don't!
Please... to God, don't...
Not unless you mean it...
...the whole shaboodle...
Cresta!
Cresta!
Cresta!
Come on! ... Honus!
I'm trying to be serious...
I am serious...
Naa... I've been thinking...
I should just go on...
What, alone?
I can travel a lot faster alone...
...and then I'd come back here for you...
...with real food, and a horse, and... clean socks...
We... are going back... together...
You and me... we're here Honus... don't you see?...
...the two of us, right here...
That's all...
We can't be any place else...
When we go back, it's not 'we' anymore...
Excuse me...
Sir, I'm sorry to break in on you like this...
My name's Cresta Maribel Lee...
- Cresta!
Johnny?
Cresta!
I could'ave swore...
Cresta, I can't...
I just can't believe it...
My God!  I'm only asking for two lousy troopers...
How hard is that then?
It's out of the question, Miss Lee...
I'm sorry, it can't be done.
He'll last two weeks if he's lucky...
- Yes, well perhaps by that time...
I may be able to send some help.
- Well, that's mighty big of you buster....
Cresta!...
Give me a horse and supplies...
...I'll go myself...
- Miss Lee, this is wild country...
I'm sorry; I can't allow you to go out there by yourself.
Well, how the hell do you think I got here?
- Cresta!
Excuse me sir, but do you think
I could have a few moments alone with Miss Lee?
I think you should, McNair...
I suggest a long and sober talk...
Yes... well, thank you Sir.  If you'll excuse me...
- Indeed!
You know, Mitchel...
Yes Sir?
When I see young people, today,
...behaving like that, I just...
...I can't help wondering what this God-damned country is coming to?
When we get home we're going to be married, aren't we?
What's so terrible about wanting to...
...get together with my bro...
Well, nothing, but, I mean, don't we...
...even get to say hello first?
Oh, for Christ's sake!
...you got no reason to swear...
- Swear?
Me swear?
You can send someone after Honus....
We can't... Not for a while.
- Why not?
Cheyenne... and you, more than anyone... ought to appreciate that.
You'll never find 'em...
Oh, we already have...
We know exactly where they are.
- Where?
- Oh just... just a little West of here...
...up by the twin rock pass, the Jewels Pass...
Are you sure of that?
- Of course.
We should be inside of their campground by tomorrow...
You know... there's only one thing wrong with me Johnny...
(sighs)... It's been so long...
...so very long...
Oh yea!
- But now we're together...
Yes!
Well, it's... just that...
I haven't had anything to eat in two days, and I'm just so hungry...
...I don't know what I'm saying...
- Hungry?
If we could just have... a little something... out on the tall grass, there. (chuckles)
Oh yea... of course... I'll... I'll be right back.
Excuse me Miss?...
What are you doing?
Ah... Shit!
It's all right...
He's my fiancée...
By...
Uh!
Whoa boy...
Whoa boy...
Whoa...
Cresta...
- Wantehemo...
- Right, men... put into your minds the dark abominations... of these Godless barbarians...
Murder...
Rape...
Torture...
And when you think of your comerades...
...fallen, butchered comerades...
...ask yourself...
Are we going to give them the same mercy?
You just be we are...
Major Phillips...
Take over.
Advance!
McNair?
Move out!
Any word about your... uh...
...Financée?
...No sir.
I'm afraid she's...
...well, I think she's hopelessly infatuated with Private Gent...
Ah, that's too bad...
I'm going to ride in the wagon...
...my back is killing me again...
(singing) Yes, we'll rally round the flag boys, we'll rally once again...
(singing) Shouting the battle cry of freedom...
(singing) We will rally from the hills, and we'll gather from the plains...
(singing) Shouting the battle cry of freedom.
(singing) The Union forever, hurrah boys, hurrah,
Down with the traitor, up with the scythe,
(singing) Yes, we'll rally round the flag, we'll rally once again,
(singing) Shouting the battle cry of freedom.
We will rally from the hills...
(singing) and we'll gather from the plains, shouting the battle cry of freedom.
Well?
- It could be the two rear flankers, Sir...
...Except that there's three of them.
- Let me have those...
We found this man riding through Lever's Pass, Sir.
It's not a cavalry mount...
No Sir.
If I may, Sir...
I'm attached to the Colorado 11th Volunteers...
- We're the Colorado 11th Volunteers...
Yes Sir!
I'm Private Honus Gent, reporting...
You?
...Cannons...
Many soldiers and guns...
You must leave...
We want no war...
Your people gave me...
...a flag...
...and a medal of friendship...
...I do not trust them...
...they will kill our people...
...we will fight...
...I say peace...
...you do not wear your necklace...
...my gift of love...
...you gave it to someone...
Yes... and I must go to him.
...my heart torn by all this...
(Cheyenne) Behavo...
If you'd let me talk to her for just a few minutes she might convince Spotted Wolf to give up without a fight...
- Without a fight?
We destroyed the rifles they were counting on, so they can't possibly win.
There's just no sense to it...
- Private Gent!
I don't know what sort of relationship you and this woman have had....
...but I can assure you that my men are prepared to move...
...against the enemy at daybreak.
...and move they will...
- Sir! ...
Twenty-one of your own comerades murdered... cut to pieces...
I know, Sir...
- The price will be paid, soldier.
Is it worth it?
-Dismissed!
Yes Sir.
Prepare to fire...
There just seems to be normal activity over there, Sir...
The cannon will commence firing at seven thirty...
...six rounds apiece until we find the range....
...and I know, McNair...
I know she's in there someplace...
...no matter what we might think of her she's still a white woman...
...that can't be helped.
No, Sir...
Can I depend on you?
I will do my duty Sir....
Good...

They're coming out Sir!
- What?    What's that?
I think it's Spotted Wolf!
- My God Sir, he's got a flag of truce...
Yes Sir, it's a white flag...
- Nonsense!
Will you see for yourself...
- I told you Lieutenant... Give the order!
Sir?
Well, give the order!
Yes Sir.
Open Fire!
Ready...
Cover ears...

They've the range now...
- Stop!

I'll put one poor devil out of its misery....
Damn you!
What are you doing?
Why?  Why?   Why?
- Shut up, Honus!
He's gone mad...
Cresta...
Got a prayer, Soldier Blue?
...a nice poem?
Say something pretty...
And to each of you...
...To officer and soldier alike,
I offer my most profound... admiration,
...my deepest affection,
...and my overwhelming gratitude... for a job well done.
You men here today... have succeeded... at making another part of America... a decent place... for people to live.
We have given the Injun...
... a lesson he will not soon forget.
But more than that...
...for the rest of your lives...
You men will hold your heads proud...
...when this day is mentioned...
...and you will say...
Yes!  I was with Iverson!
The Eleventh Colorado Volunteers...
Move out!
Cresta...
On November 29th, 1864, a unit of Colorado cavalry, numbering over 700 men, attacked a peaceful Cheyenne village at Sand Creek, Colorado.
The Indians raised the American Flag and a white flag of surrender.
Nevertheless the cavalry attacked...
...massacring 500 Indians, more than half of whom were women and children.
Over one hundred scalps were taken...
...bodies dismembered...
...plus numerous reports of rape.
General Nelson A. Miles,
...Army Chief of Staff...
...termed the massacre...
...perhaps the foulest and most unjust crime...
...in the annals of America.

Esther. Jane-Marie.
Up and dressed.
Come on out now, ladies.
- Train ain't due for a damn week.
- Where's Esther?
She's busy. She's got an all-nighter.
Myrtle.
All right, fall in.
Dress up, Madigan. Dress up.
Murphy, dress 'em up. Come along.
- How long you gonna be?
- 20 minutes, half an hour.
Howdy do, ma'am?
You could have a lot of fun out of me, darlin', if you tried.
One thing about me, darlin',
I won't go to hell for not tryin'.
Message from Fort Humboldt for the governor.
I'll take it.
It's an army transport train.
No civilians on board.
Well, this is an odd place to settle.
OK, you heard him, gentlemen. Line it up.
- Major Claremont.
- Sergeant, get me Captain Oakland.
Fall out the troops for exercise, but keep them out of those tents.
Yes, sir.
Now you listen to me.
You will remain hard by this train.
You ever see an Indian washing?
They're dirty, and they're ignorant.
Major Claremont.
- How long will this take?
- As long as necessary, Governor.
This train runs on steam.
That requires water.
Let's get it done as quickly as possible.
Of course.
All right, fall in.
There will be no skylarking...
Bellew said you want to see me.
Get your cipher book.
See what you can make of this.
- It's for the governor.
- It's from the fort.
Maybe it'll tell us what's going on.
Pissant politicians running an army train.
Yes, sir.
Havin' any problems?
No. We're just making sure we're not gonna have any, Lieutenant.
- Newell, come with me a minute.
- For what, Captain?
Major gave me a message from the fort to be deciphered.
Looks like you've got room for one more.
No civilians, except by special permission from Washington.
I'm a deputy US marshal.
Indian agent for the territory.
The governor can tell ya.
My orders are to accept no unauthorised persons on this train.
Dr Molyneux and the Reverend
Peabody are posted to Fort Humboldt.
The young lady is a daughter of the commandant at the fort.
Why do you want to go to Humboldt?
Levi Calhoun. He's in custody up there. I wanna bring him back.
- If ever a man deserved to hang...
- And hang he will.
The sooner I can get up there, the sooner he takes the drop.
We can have him sent to you under armed escort.
You said that ain't army business.
That way or no way.
Good day, Marshal.
Major Claremont.
Locomotive's ready, sir.
- Very well, Sergeant. Carry on.
- Major.
I can't find Lieutenant
Newell or Captain Oakland.
Corporal said Humboldt's only two days up the line.
Something funny's goin' on.
Get the hell off here, son.
Wonder why we ain't movin' yet.
You sign up yesterday? Hurry up and wait. Hurry up and wait.
Right, I need eight volunteers right now.
You, you, you two. You.
You, Murphy. You too, Rafferty.
Here's what I want you to do.
Go up and scour this town.
Captain Oakland and Lieutenant Newell are missin'. See if you can find 'em.
Murphy and I will take the small tent.
Have you found them?
- Not yet.
- Next time bring a nursemaid.
- The train cannot be held any longer.
- You expect me to leave my officers?
I'm very sorry. You know the urgency of our mission.
Just a goddamn minute.
Just once too often, friend.
Put the gun away, friend.
What's your problem?
Slippery Fingers here took $120 off of me.
- Maybe he's a good poker player.
- Too good to be true.
Looks like a pretty fair hand to me.
What's your name?
John Deakin.
Stand up.
I said stand up.
- No gun?
- I'm not a man of violence.
What's known as playing it close to the chest.
That's not good enough, Marshal. Outside.
I'm not a man of violence.
- That's enough.
- Not for me it's not.
Marshal, look at this.
"Wanted for theft, gambling debts, arson and murder."
"John Murray, alias John
Deakin, alias Hayes."
"Former lecturer at the
University of Iowa."
A lecturer in what, Mr Deakin?
- Medicine.
- You don't expect us to believe that?
Here. Listen to this.
"Convicted of embezzlement."
"Trapped in Lake's Crossing, where he escaped under cover of a fire that he set."
The whole town burned down.
Seven people killed.
Seven people. My God,
Richard, that's awful.
He blew up a wagonload of explosives in Sharps.
It's still not army business.
Those explosives was on the way to the presidio in San Francisco.
That makes it army business.
I'm pretty sure Mr Deakin here's gonna be my ticket to Humboldt.
So the governor here got hold of some of his friends in Washington, had me appointed Indian agent for the territory.
More ways to pacify Indians than shooting holes in 'em.
But you did that, too.
In the line of duty, of course.
Even back in Ohio, we knew about Nathan Pearce.
- Notorious, was I?
- No. Famous is more like it.
"Famous" is a better word, Marshal.
I must admire your spunk, young lady.
It's not an easy life out here.
How come you're making this trip if no civilians are supposed to be aboard?
I have friends in high places.
Miss Scoville's joining her father, at his urgent request.
Gentlemen, I have a hard day tomorrow.
At my age, sleep is a necessity.
- "A hard day tomorrow"?
- I have to check the medical supplies.
We're cut off from the world now.
May I please just know what in the hell is going on?
Governor, these are all intelligent people.
I think they have a right to know.
Dr Molyneux here is a specialist.
Your troops are not merely relief. They're replacements for soldiers who've died.
- Died?
- God save us. The Indians.
Not Indians. Fort Humboldt is in the grip of a diphtheria epidemic.
Oh, Richard. My father.
We're in daily contact with the fort,
Marica, and your father's fine.
Why wasn't I told?
Because we might have lost the rest of your command, not only two officers.
- They must have found out.
- Governor, how dare you expose a lady,
- all of us, to this dreadful pestilence?
- We have provisions for a month.
We'll remain aboard until Dr
Molyneux pronounces Humboldt clean.
He's got as good a chance as any of catching the diphtheria.
I've already had the disease. I'm immune.
- Where'd you catch it?
- In Mexico. Why?
Just curious.
How many troops are available for duty?
- Gentlemen.
- Doctor.
25 out of a garrison of 76.
The others are too sick for duty, or dead.
- White Hand must like that.
- White Hand?
Paiute chief. He needs watchin'.
25 men. That's not even enough for patrols.
If you'll excuse me.
Marica. Are you all right?
Yes, of course.
It's been a long day.
Are you going to leave him like this all night?
I reckon we could turn him loose in the morning.
By then we'll be in snow country, and he'll have no place to go.
You sure got a mighty poor choice for your pity, ma'am.
Then you make a mighty poor example of a lawman, Mr Pearce.
A man is innocent until proved guilty.
But you've tried, convicted and condemned.
Show me the law that says you can treat a man like a wild animal.
You frightened me.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
Aren't you afraid of someone seeing you?
I'm afraid we're not much of a secret any more.
You should have told me about the epidemic at the fort.
Why?
You'd only have worried.
Or are you afraid I might have deserted, too?
No, I'd never think that.
Let's wait until we get off the train.
Can I get you something?
There's some food left.
No, thanks.
A drink?
That I'll have.
Would you untie my legs?
Don't be silly.
- I won't go anywhere, I promise.
- I'm sure you won't.
I'm all cramped up and I need the circulation.
I give you my word.
I'll only untie your legs.
And if you want to hop off the train, it's a long hop to anywhere.
There. Better?
Give me a hand up?
Oh, my God.
You promised.
When a man is a killer, arsonist, a cheat and a coward, it's hardly surprising if he turns out to be a liar as well.
- Is your mother still alive?
- Yes. But what's that to do with you?
- But she's not well.
- How do you know that?
If she were, the commander of the fort would be visited by his wife, and not his daughter.
It's strange, you coming out here with diphtheria around, and the Indians on the prod.
It must have been an urgent invitation that brought you.
But not by letter. Your invitation came by telegraph, right?
- You gonna marry the governor?
- Really. This is quite intolerable.
Before you leave, tie my hands again.
Not so tightly.
Why all this concern and interest in me?
I should have thought you,
Mr Deakin, had enough worries.
I have.
Thank you.
Have Ferguson ready with his telegraph equipment when we stop at 7.00.
- And get Mr O'Brien.
- Yes, sir.
- Why are we stopping?
- Morning, Governor.
My orders are to contact the fort daily at this hour.
I hope you have no objection.
Make it short, please, Major.
Time's important.
Fall out, everybody. Everybody out.
Nice fresh air out here, men.
Everybody outside.
Come on, get it out of there, Bennett.
Guard mounts for everybody. Murphy, you post guards on the other side.
And you, you, you and you, up on the top. Keep your eyes open.
White Hand's around here somewhere, men, waiting to pounce on you little boys.
So stay awake, stay alert, and keep your iron unbuckled.
I'll be right back.
I've gotten through to them, Major, and they've acknowledged.
My regards to Colonel Scoville, and congratulations on the capture of Levi Calhoun.
That's the train, Calhoun.
What do I tell 'em?
How do I know you won't pull no fancy tricks?
I swear I never would.
I don't believe you, soldier.
My God.
The fort's answering, sir.
As God is my witness, Calhoun,
I'll see you before a firing squad.
Don't you give me no trouble, Colonel.
I got your bluebellies locked up.
By God, I'll skin 'em alive, one by each.
Major Claremont.
The epidemic's worsened.
- Is there news of my father?
- It has his signature, so he must be fine.
They're asking about our time of arrival, sir.
With this weather, I guess we'll be at Breakheart Pass in about 20 hours.
Transmit that. Add my compliments to Colonel Scoville.
Then get Myrtle City. Request word on
Captain Oakland and Lieutenant Newell.
Yes, sir.
- I can't get Myrtle City, Major.
- Keep trying.
- Dead, sir.
- I don't understand how it could've gone.
Weather's been good.
It worked yesterday.
- Sergeant Bellew, board the troops.
- Yes, sir.
Troopers, fall in. Board the train.
Murphy, get 'em aboard.
You be sure you take a roll call.
I don't wanna leave anybody behind.
- Seen Dr Molyneux this morning?
- No, not yet.
- Shall I send for him, Governor?
- No, it isn't necessary.
Dr Molyneux had better adjust to army schedules. We don't run a restaurant.
Dr Molyneux.
The governor asked for you, sir.
It looks like some sort of seizure.
Apoplexy, I'd say.
You mind if I have a look?
- What the devil for?
- I do know something about medicine.
Why not, Major?
All right.
- The skin's broken above the left ear.
- Of course. He fell.
- Died before a bruise could form.
- Apoplexy kills instantly.
No, a seizure like that would turn the lips and the fingers blue.
It's lucky we have the law aboard.
Now, what does that mean?
There's a puncture. Right there.
Just below the ribs.
Looks like somebody knocked him out, stuck a surgical probe up under his ribs.
God save us.
- It's hard to believe.
- The fact is, we have a killer aboard.
Yes, we have.
Move it along, men. Murphy, keep an eye on that detail.
I'll check the drivers.
Sergeant, as soon as the engineer is finished, put the men back on the train.
- We've got to move along.
- Yes, sir.
Madigan, you and Bennett over here, keep a sharp lookout.
Keep them logs moving, men.
Think how lucky you are. You're warm.
On the double. We don't have all day. Get that wood up there.
It's colder than hell out here.
- Where's Deakin?
- Inside. Don't worry yourself.
At least he's got good sense.
Men on top, all aboard.
Back to your cars.
Dr Molyneux is dead. Two of the major's best officers are missing.
And we can't get through to Myrtle. Do you mind?
Go ahead.
Nobody heard anything.
Nobody saw anything.
And nobody knows anything.
It can only get better.
Well, you know, maybe they were accidents after all.
We might have seen the end of it.
Have you gone crazy?
He fell. My fireman fell.
He's dead.
You can't be sure.
Somebody better check on him.
Somebody that knows somethin' about doctoring.
He might try to run off on us.
Looks like every bone in his body is busted.
Move out, men.
Can we make up the lost time?
Men are dying in that fort.
- Sergeant Bellew, board the troops.
- Yes, sir. Troopers, fall in.
Do you mind if I have a look up there in that locomotive?
If it's all right with the marshal, it's all right with me.
Go ahead.
Whiskey. He was reeking with it.
God is my witness, I never saw
Jackson touch that stuff.
Trooper Rafferty reporting, sir.
I'm your new fireman.
Hop up, young fella.
Morning, sir.
Good morning. You must be Carlos the chef.
I am. And you must be
Mr Deakin, the murderer.
How about some coffee? It's hot.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Marshal Pearce.
You're all mighty relaxed in the face of what's transpired aboard this train.
- What?
- If Deakin's right, Molyneux was killed.
The telegraph line to
Myrtle no longer works.
It could be ice or animals, even wind.
I think this bears investigation, more than you're giving it.
Some little time ago I had a choice, Colonel.
Major.
Keep your nose clean and you'll get there.
What about it?
Never had no call to be a detective.
We're gonna all be on this train for a while.
We just might find out what happened before we have to get off.
Could be you did it all.
Could be.
Or you.
Oh, hell, we're stopping again.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
- We're going backwards.
- Oh, my God.
- He's right. We're not stopping.
- I know.
What's going on?
Quickly. Get in your bunks.
Down there.
- Move. Get in those bunks and stay there.
- Sarge, I'm scared. What's going on?
Lay down, and stay there.
Get back in your bunks.
All of you, get back in your bunks.
It'll be all right. Stay in your bunks.
Troopers, calm down. Don't panic.
- God. It's locked from the outside.
- What the hell is going on here?
Where's that brakeman?
Where's that brakeman? Open it.
It's broken. The metal must have crystallised.
- I don't know why the brakes didn't hold.
- Sounded like a gunshot to me.
Thank God we didn't lose the medical supplies.
- Not much good without a doctor.
- You're a doctor. Least, so you said.
- Not any more I'm not.
- Simple charity to your fellow man.
My fellow man is about to hang me.
Major, we must try for more replacements.
Major, you have to contact the fort.
The telegraph set's in the front of the supply wagon.
Henry, telegraph set in the supply wagon.
Sooner or later, me and sonny boy are gonna need some sleep.
There's nothing you can do about that. They're dead.
So am I. Or as good as.
It wasn't your fault. You were back there with us. Nothing you could have done.
It ain't there, sir.
- What?
- The spare telegraph set. It's gone.
Mighty glad to see you, White Hand.
You made good time.
The train?
It's comin'.
- Soldiers?
- No word yet.
Me, too, sonny boy.
Me, too.
All right. Six hours, no more.
Take a compartment in the next car.
Who's gonna watch the steam?
I think we have someone who can take care of that.
Feed in the fuel to keep the needle between 100 and 130.
You got any questions?
Use the wood pile on the left.
The other's no good. It's wet.
- He says they didn't wreck the troop cars.
- Son of a bitch.
He ain't done yet, Jebbo.
Hawkins, ask him what time he gets to Breakheart Pass.
Then tell him to stop the train when he gets there.
We'll have to get rid of those soldiers.
White Hand's gonna have to work a mite harder than he figured.
It's about time. It's almost morning.
I'm hungry.
Pressure's right up there.
Go back and go to bed. You can sleep the rest of the way.
Mind if I help myself?
Of course not, Major.
What is it, Henry?
I can't find the reverend.
He can't be far. Only ten minutes ago he was trying to save my soul.
Could he have fallen off?
- We could back up and look for him.
- Where's O'Brien? We'll back up.
- No.
- My God, Richard.
- Why not?
- Someone is trying to stop this train.
- I will not allow that to happen.
- I can't believe you won't stop to look.
Marica, darling, there are men dying at that fort who desperately need our help.
It's my responsibility to get us there.
If the reverend was stupid or unlucky enough to have fallen off, I'm sorry.
- We're going through.
- Governor.
You are one superior son of a bitch.
We'll search what's left of this train.
Who are you?
John Deakin.
What are you?
He must have fallen off. If we back up maybe five miles...
He certainly wouldn't have jumped off.
Reverend Peabody was small. A big, strong man could have thrown him off.
Me, I have an alibi. Miss Scoville obviously is not a strong man.
But the rest of you are big, strong men.
What the hell are you talking about?
You're pretty free with your theories.
And my whiskey.
A damn sight better than that whiskey back in Myrtle.
Marshal. There's no need for that.
Mr Deakin is not a man of violence.
He told us what he's not, but not what he is.
Carlos?
Are you in there?
They're all gone.
Carlos is gone, Deakin's gone.
The place is a goddamn mess.
What are you talking about?
Talk sense, man.
The ammunition boxes are open.
The coffins are open. They're gone.
You're drunk.
Drunk? I wish to hell I was drunk.
Don't. You'll die if you do.
No, not me. Your friends out there.
I'm gonna take my hand away.
Don't scream. You promise?
You damn fool. You'll get us both killed.
There's no help for you out there.
Especially not from your friend the governor.
Don't scream.
I want you to hide me.
Why should I?
To save both our lives.
I asked you this once before, and you didn't tell me.
You'd better tell me now.
Who are you?
My name is John Deakin.
That's my real name.
- I work for the US Secret Service.
- I don't believe you.
Do you believe I'm a killer?
You've got about a minute to make up your mind.
- Who is it?
- O'Brien, ma'am.
Come in. The door's not locked.
- What is it?
- The prisoner, Deakin. He's escaped.
Where could a man escape to in this wilderness?
That's the point, there is no place.
That's why we think he's still on the train.
- And you think perhaps I had...?
- No.
Just that he could have sneaked in when you were asleep.
I can assure you he isn't hiding under my bed.
Please excuse me.
Tight squeeze.
I'm a damn fool. Now please get out.
I want you to do one more thing for me.
Go along and bring back the major.
Nobody else. Just the major.
Don't even talk to anybody.
- But Governor Fairchild...
- Especially not Governor Fairchild.
Get on, now.
- What in God's name?
- Put it away.
- You'll use it later.
- I don't believe a word of it.
What if I showed you 400 Winchester rifles that were stolen from the factory?
We've been tracking them halfway across the country.
They're on the train now, in the supply car.
All those men killed.
The train half wrecked.
- All that over stolen rifles?
- There's more to it than that.
And the governor? Surely he'd have nothing to do with it.
I intend to see that Governor
Fairchild stands trial for murder.
Major Claremont.
Deakin must have got to him.
Where in God's name can they be?
In the supply wagon.
We've looked everywhere else.
Find 'em and kill 'em. Both.
I'm sorry.
- I want to see those rifles.
- You will.
Miss Scoville, stay in the compartment, and keep your door looked after we leave.
Understand?
All right, stolen rifles.
Not worth all that killing.
Dr Molyneux... there was no reason.
If you remember, Molyneux said he was going to inspect the medical supplies.
Rifles, dynamite, ammunition... not much a doctor would be interested in.
My God. The diphtheria, those men at the fort.
There is no diphtheria.
Reverend Peabody didn't go into the supplies.
I don't think he went to church, either.
Mr Peabody was a secret service operative for 15 years, the last five of them with me.
Don't touch that gun.
Hey, point that thing the other way.
I'm just a working stiff.
The major's just in back.
Bring him over here.
Get down.
- Where's your gun?
- I don't have a gun. I'm just the engineer.
- No.
- Jump.
- Where's the gun?
- It's in the box.
Underneath the seat.
I don't know who you are, but the law says...
The law's who I am.
Have a look behind that wood.
They got onto something back there in Myrtle, and died for it.
Then when Jackson the fireman spotted the bodies,
Banlon threw him off the train.
Are you gonna listen to this murderer?
I looked at Jackson at the bottom of the trestle... a head wound with a lot of blood.
A dead man doesn't bleed.
You probably hit him with a wrench before you threw him off.
Before God, Major, I don't know what he's talking about.
Major, sir, what do I do?
Keep your gun on Banlon.
If he moves, kill him.
We'll have to crawl forward on the roof and shoot him out.
What for? He's driving us right where we wanna go.
Let's agree that Deakin is no idiot.
Why is he taking us there?
Let's get 'er done.
My job was to arrange a train. I'm no gunman.
That's true, O'Brien.
But a noose would fit your neck just as neatly as it would fit ours.
Hey, sonny boy.
Give me the wrench there.
The nut on the brake handle's loose.
Give me the wrench.
You know how to run this thing?
I think so.
You suspected everybody else.
Why not me?
Marshal Pearce was our number one suspect.
You didn't want him on the train.
That put you in the clear.
What's ahead of us at the fort?
What's wrong there?
Calhoun's not in custody.
He's probably with White Hand, and they're in control of the fort.
My God, what for?
Humboldt's a shipping point for all gold and silver from California and Nevada.
That's why everybody's involved, except the girl.
The Indians want the rifles and ammunition back there.
I figure they were gonna put the gold and silver in the coffins and ship it back.
There's a gun lined up on you gents. Now stop the train.
- You hurt?
- Only my dignity.
Breakheart Pass coming up.
Where are the soldiers?
Where are they, Deakin?
- Here they come.
- Look.
Hang on.
That son of a bitch.
Why'd he stop now?
This is where we get off.
- You know anything about dynamite?
- Of course.
Set this to blow the rails, but don't light the fuse until I get back.
Why the hell are they shooting?
Tell an Indian things'll be one way and they're not, he'll think you crossed him.
- They know you, Marshal. Show yourself.
- Like hell.
- You son of a bitch. What's going on?
- A man's aboard. He's got the engine.
You dumb pilgrims.
Ain't nobody in that engine.
Get the troopers at the fort, but watch out for Calhoun.
- When these blow, he'll ride out here.
- Right.
If we get the pressure back up, I can take her on in. Let's stoke her up.
That's the train. Let's ride.
Tell the Indians to form a work party and replace that track with one from behind.
Take the claw, put it in like this, and pull down.
Over here. Put it here, like that, and pull it down.
All right, take it away.
Where's Fairchild?
The Palace car.
Fairchild.
Maybe you know what's going on around here.
No.
Keep 'em working, O'Brien.
Let me go.
Help.
Help.
Let her go.
The hell I will.
Fairchild.
I reckon we've come down to it, Deakin.
You have a choice.
You could throw that gun down.
I don't think I can do that.
Are you all right?
Your father's waiting for you out there.
Whoo-ha!
Hey, Choctaw!
Let her burn, boys!
I don´t like storekeepers. And
I hate storekeepers´ windows.
- Have ´em mount up, Harv.
- Oh, my God.
Get ´em outta here.
Give me that.
Sober up, Choctaw! Mount up.
We´re riding back to Sabbath now.
Whoa.
Aw, stand still.
Here.
- It´s my brother-in-law,
Marc Corman. - Who?
I´m Jered Maddox.
Cotton Ryan.
You the marshal?
What can I do for you, Maddox?
Vincent Bronson,
Choctaw Lee, Jack Dekker,
Vern Adams, Hurd
Price, Harvey Stenbaugh.
- Marc Corman. Know any of ´em?
- All of them.
- That makes it easy.
- Does it?
I want these men brought in under arrest by noon tomorrow.
I want ´em fed and ready for travel.
- You got papers sworn out?
- I´ll get ´em if you need ´em.
Not from anybody in this territory, you won´t.
- You´ve got Jurisdiction.
- I´ve got Jurisdiction.
But you couldn´t have reason enough to get papers from me. Nobody could.
Three months ago Bronson took 8,000 head of cattle across the Kiowa.
On the way back they hit a town called Bannock.
They drank their fill, had their women, shot up the town.
All Just cowboy fun.
They killed an old man.
- Kin?
- No.
I´m Just the lawman in Bannock.
Look at this town.
Nice, quiet town.
Nice town to live in.
They got no railhead, no digging up in the hills, no reason to grow fat.
This town eats because Vincent
Bronson puts their bread on the table.
He owns the town. He owns the county.
People around here owe him.
Those men on your list stand in Bronson´s shadow. I can´t move against those men.
You carry the law.
I carry nothing.
I sit there cos Bronson says ´´Sit.´´
I´ve been paid for, Maddox.
You carry messages, don´t you?
I´m gonna take these men back with me or kill them where they stand.
They got till noon tomorrow. Tell ´em.
- That one of them out there?
- Corman.
You can take his name off the list.
What happened?
He called me out.
What´s the trouble?
What happened, Marshal?
Better come inside, Sam. One of you take Corman to the undertaker´s.
The rest of you, go on about your business.
- As a member of the citizens´ council...
- Get it second-hand from the mayor.
- How far to the Bronson spread?
- I wouldn´t know.
Who´s he? Some bounty hunter or something?
Don´t make an enemy of him, storekeeper. Step wide of him.
That´s about it, Mr Bronson.
He said by noon tomorrow.
- And Marc Corman´s dead?
- He´s dead.
How´d it happen?
He came up against the wrong man. I don´t know the details.
Marc was a good man with a gun.
He was a bigmouth who thought he was a good man with a gun.
There´s a cold hole in the ground between the two.
His family know?
I sent word.
I´ll ride out there in the morning.
How do you measure this thing, Cotton?
I think you got trouble, Mr Bronson.
Unless you say he´s all mistaken.
I wish he was. There´s no mistake.
We got a little drunk, broke a bit of glass. I didn´t know anyone was killed.
Tell Maddox l´m sorry, really sorry.
I´ll make it good. I´ll pay the damages, l´ll fix it up with the old man´s family.
Tell him l´ll make it all right with him, too.
Better still, arrange a meeting tomorrow. I´ll deal straight with him.
- And if he doesn´t wanna talk?
- Why shouldn´t he?
Some men Just go at a thing in a straight line.
They don´t bend and they don´t trade.
- You telling me Maddox is like that?
- He´s got the mark.
That´s too bad. Then he´s going to buy himself a lot of pain.
Try him, Cotton. Talk to him.
He got you spooked, Ryan.
No, Harv. I´m not on his list.
- Is that all, Mr Bronson?
- Yeah.
All right, Harv. Chew it out.
I don´t like asking favours.
No one´s asking you to bend your knee, Harv. Just a talk.
Some worn-out tin star who wouldn´t rate cutting your cigars.
- Ryan doesn´t rate him that low.
- Ryan´s a kicked dog.
Maybe that´s what makes him a better Judge of men like Maddox.
- There was a time, Vince...
- It´s passed, Harv.
What do you wanna do, ride into Sabbath and gun him down?
Those days have passed.
Times have changed.
There are other ways. You buy him.
And if he doesn´t sell, you buy the man above him.
Those killing days were for younger men.
I´m on that list, Vince. I´m not riding his dust back to Bannock.
Neither am l.
The others´ll be here soon.
I sent Jason and Crowe.
We´ll talk then.
- We don´t need the others.
- We´ll talk.
It´s your land. It´s your grass.
You´ve never been on wages, Harv.
What´s out there´s as much yours as mine.
- Ten years too long, Jered.
- Hello, Laura.
- Can I come in?
- Sure.
- It don´t seem ten years.
- To me it does.
Won´t you sit down?
You look good, Laura.
You´re a soft-tongued liar.
- You live in Sabbath?
- Near.
What are you doing here?
That´s not an honest question.
I know what you´re doing here.
I was in town getting some supplies and I heard about it.
Do you think you owe me anything, Jered?
Say it out plain, Laura.
My man, Hurd Price, he´s one of the men you want.
I guess it had to be something like that.
He work for Bronson?
No. We have a small farm between here and the high country, and he takes work from
Bronson when he can get it.
Let him go, Jered.
He never shot anybody.
He stands with the rest.
- Sorry, Laura.
- The hell you are!
Nobody has to die. Just tell him to come into town and give himself up.
- What will happen to him then?
- He´ll go back to Bannock and stand trial.
Will they hang him?
The circuit Judge is no hanging Judge.
A man like Bronson could buy him cheap.
I don´t mean Just the Judge. I mean the town, the good people with the rope.
My town, Laura. Nobody gets a mob rope in my town. You know that.
I give you my word. If he comes in peaceful, there´ll be no hurt come to him.
You never did give much away.
Would you have come, Laura, if your man hadn´t been on the list?
No. There´s nothing left over from before, Jered. Goodbye.
He has until tomorrow.
I called you in cos we´ve got trouble.
You remember last spring we took a herd over the Kiowa?
We hit a town called
Bannock on the way back.
Seven of us went into town. Do you recall?
None too clearly.
We shot up the town.
Seems an old man took a bullet.
We thought it was nothing but a lot of broken glass, but... seems now it´s a bit more.
The hard point of the matter is there´s a lawman, name of Maddox, in Sabbath.
Figures to take us back and stand trial for murder.
One lawman?
Ryan thinks he´s enough.
Cotton Ryan.
Choctaw, you may not think much of Ryan as he stands now, but... in his day, you couldn´t walk in the same sun as him.
- Where´s Marc Corman?
- Marc Corman´s dead.
Corman´s dead cos he called short on this Maddox.
Marc Corman´s dead?
I called you here to hear what you have to say.
Well, Vern?
I don´t know, Mr Bronson.
I don´t want trouble.
I appreciate you asking for our opinion, but it seems to me that you got some choice and I don´t.
I can´t go back to Bannock. If I do, my land dries up and blows away.
My beef gets scattered into the high country.
I don´t have the hands to keep my spread tied down.
You know l´d see you right.
I´d send some of the boys and give my mark to cover your losses.
Thanks, and I know you mean it, but I have to work my own.
Well, what do you suggest, Vern?
I don´t suggest anything and
I don´t aim to do anything.
- Just stay close and mind what´s mine.
- And if he comes after you?
- I´ll stop him if I can.
- Stop him first and make sure.
I didn´t kill anybody that night in
Bannock. I´ve got no quarrel with the law.
- You, Choctaw?
- You give the orders, Mr Bronson.
- I asked for an opinion.
- It was an accident.
If that lawman wants to lean hard, then I say we set him running.
I go along with Choctaw.
But, as he says, Mr
Bronson, you give the orders.
Hurd?
Well, l´d like to hear what you have to say, Vince.
Want your say, Harv?
I say we tell the lawman to peddle his law in Bannock.
You got all the guns you need, Mr Bronson.
Maddox needs a lesson taught.
Can I say something, Pa?
I was never in Bannock, but it seems to me if Pa is willing to pay for the damages, give the old man´s family something, then this Maddox has no cause to push.
If he does, I think Harv´s right.
There are two men dead already. That´s a bit heavy.
I don´t think this Maddox runs easy.
And killing a lawman is a certain way for trouble.
I´ll talk with him. Maybe he has a price. Maybe he´s a reasonable man.
If not, all we´ve lost is a few hours.
If we decide to go back, l´ll cover any of your losses.
Most we´d face is a fine, anyway, if that.
We´ll try it my way.
Our food´s been laid out. Vern,
Hurd, will you gentlemen be my guests?
Choctaw, show ´em where to get washed up.
When it comes down to bedrock, my word don´t call much, does it, Vince?
I´m Just hired help.
No man means more to me, Harv.
All l´ve got is you and Jason.
But you´re like some yellow dun ladino
- all longhorn and no brains.
We´ve 10,000 head of good cows, a valley of sweet grass and money in the bank.
That didn´t come easy.
We´ve both of us put 30 years of sweat into it.
I don´t want to drop it on some dumb gunplay.
I don´t like to see you backing off, Vince.
You´re making a mistake.
I don´t see it that way.
Ride into Sabbath in the morning and see Ryan, hear how he made out.
I wanna step around this.
If Maddox is open, tell
Ryan to set up a meeting.
- Send Jason.
- I´m asking you.
Keep clear of Maddox.
Take Crowe with you.
It´s a great life.
If you were some cheap gunsel with a big name, they´d all be buying you drinks, rubbing up against you, fixing up what they´re gonna tell the kids and the ones who weren´t there.
But if you´re a lawman, you´re a disease. They need you, but they hate you.
Comes with the Job.
I saw Bronson.
- He wants to talk.
- Talk?
He wants to trade.
He says he´s sorry. He means it. I know him.
He didn´t know anybody was killed.
He wants to make it all good.
- Something for my pockets, too.
- Why not?
- You could hear what he´s got to say.
- I Just heard.
- The old man was Just an accident.
- They can say their piece in Bannock.
- Be reasonable, Maddox.
- ´Night, Ryan.
There´ll be some dying.
It´ll be their doing.
Mr Bronson?
What are you doing out here, Crowe?
We Just brought a couple of hundred head up from Bornite Creek.
I saw a rider and...
Who else is with you?
Hitchins and Jason, sir.
You and my son are about the same age, aren´t you, Crowe?
Jason´s a bit younger.
Five, six months.
- Ever been up here before?
- No, sir. I figured it was private.
From this high ground you can see the whole valley on a clear day.
From the sierras to White Wolf Pass.
Down there was the old Comanche camp.
We broke ´em there, Harvey and me and my brothers.
Brother Jacob died there.
They were fine people, the Comanches.
Don´t ever listen to any talk that runs down an lndian.
We buried brother Jacob here and later brother Aaron beside him.
They´d had enough of guns and killing.
The dead don´t have much.
Crowe, did you ever feel the world turn beneath your feet?
No, sir.
You best be getting back down, son.
Choctaw, the kid had the edge.
- You´re sand-blind, Jack.
- You take him on, Jack.
- Five dollars, Choctaw?
- Like stealing from a blind man´s cup.
That´s fair. I figure Crowe´s
Just emptied your cup, Lee.
- What do you say, Crowe?
- I guess about even.
Even? Sonny, you were way behind.
Again. The top man takes
Dekker´s money from him.
One, two, three.
Move out! I want those cows moved down into Wolf Pass by tomorrow tonight.
Crowe, you come with me.
We gotta go into Sabbath.
- Gonna bite on that lawman, Harv?
- Move your ass outta here, Lee!
Leave a bit, Mr Stenbaugh.
I fancy a bit of tin star.
I´ll leave enough for you to cut your first teeth on, Choctaw.
- You´re a gentleman.
- Choctaw.
- What do you think he´s gonna do?
- Chew the hell out of that law dog.
Maddox.
Mr Maddox.
Mr Maddox, your room.
What I mean is, we are getting a regular.
A drummer. Women´s goods and Jewellery.
I wasn´t expecting you to be staying over.
To put a fine edge on things, I need your room.
He always expects to get the same room and...
Is there something you wanted?
Can´t say there is, Minister.
A man comes to the house of God, he comes to seek.
- I´m not a believing man, Minister.
- Then why have you come?
A man doesn´t see many churches like this... in a town like Sabbath.
The shape of the house of God is unimportant.
That´s not so, Minister.
The kind of church a man builds to pray in tells you a lot about the man.
Further south there are some fine old adobe churches, Mexican.
They´re cool and dark inside. They give a man peace.
They´re made for kneeling. This one´s made for standing upright.
There is no easy comfort from God.
Tell me, Minister, you must know all the people in this town.
Those who come to my church.
I don´t see a land office. If I wanted to see a map of the territory, a map with the deed boundaries marked on it, who might be able to oblige?
Why do you ask me?
I figured you´d be the one man in this town who´d find it difficult to lie to me.
Mr Dusaine is the legal expert.
He takes care of all such matters.
Thank you, Minister. Good morning.
It´s beautiful.
(woman) That´s him.
Mr Dusaine.
You have the deed maps for this territory. I´d like to see them.
- And who, pray tell, told you...
- The minister.
I need written permission before I could allow you to examine such documents.
Sir, I shall call the marshal.
You do that.
Thank you, Mr Dusaine.
Don´t try to soften me up, Cotton.
Doesn´t your lawman wanna talk?
- Take it easy, Harv.
- Yes or no?
Why do you wanna push things until they break? Let Bronson handle it.
You gonna mealy-mouth around or you gonna tell me?
He won´t trade. You can have your say in Bannock.
Did you crawl, Ryan?
I wasn´t asked to.
I told Vince you weren´t the man to carry this. Where is Maddox?
Climb down, Harvey.
You can´t ride this man.
Run to hell, Ryan.
Maddox.
I´m Harv Stenbaugh.
Well, lawman?
- What´s your name, son?
- Crowe Wheelwright.
- I´ve no business with you.
- You´ve got business with me.
Drop that gun belt.
I´m taking you in.
No, you´re not. You got two ways to move, lawman.
Run or take me.
Don´t make me kill you, son.
Now, Just a minute. What you gonna do? He shot him down in the street.
You all know why you´re here.
What I wanna know is what are we going to do?
He wants to know what we´re going to do.
Marc Corman and Harvey
Stenbaugh were our friends.
Do we care about our friends?
Corman´s widow - my sister - and the little ones, do we care about them?
Are we Just gonna stand around here and talk?
Talk never moved a thing or pulled a stump.
Are we gonna stand around and wait while this killer shoots whoever he wants?
- He´s a lawman.
- What? What?
How do we know that? Anyway, he ain´t the lawman here.
What happened in Bannock months ago is of no concern to us, but we must respect the law.
As your mayor, I say we gotta protect our own.
- This man has got to be stopped.
- What have you got in mind, Harris?
We all go over to the hotel, all of us, and we go meaning business.
And that means going armed.
We can tell Maddox to get out of town.
Now, now, wait a minute, Luther.
That sounds like vigilante talk.
- Shouldn´t we stay within the limits of...
- Sam, Sam.
It seems to me that you as mayor should be giving lead, not trying to keep your hat on straight.
This town owes Vince Bronson a lot.
Legally speaking, there is a precedence for forming a citizens´ committee.
Only if there´s been a breakdown in the formal law services.
Well, Ryan is broken down enough to satisfy any precedence.
Moss is right, you know.
We´re all beholden to Bronson, and a Bronson man was murdered.
We can talk till sundown and accomplish nothing, or we can act.
I say that we call off this meeting and do what we know is right.
Now, Luther, let´s...
Anybody here who calls himself a man and wants out better speak right now.
Anybody? Well, then, I think we´ve got our work cut out for us.
Oh, dear.
You know what that man meant to me.
I held him above all other men, closer even than my brothers.
I want him, Ryan. I want him broken.
I want his face in the dirt.
And l´ll hang what´s left of him, hang him for the murderer he is.
I don´t care how, I don´t care who, so long as l´m there to see it.
- It wasn´t murder, Mr Bronson.
- I call it murder.
- Harv was on the prod.
- I call it murder.
And I want something done about it.
The great Cotton Ryan.
You were good with a gun once. You were beautiful.
But Fort Bliss was a long time ago, wasn´t it, Ryan?
I don´t like men sweating fear in my house.
You pay me, Mr Bronson, and I eat your dirt.
But that don´t make what you say right.
- Get out.
- When l´m finished, Mr Bronson.
Leave him!
Harvey was on the prod.
He went after Maddox.
He put the horn in and then he made his move first. Don´t make the same mistake.
Don´t go at a man like
Maddox with a hammer.
You want him. I understand that.
I figured that was your play.
But finish that thing in
Bannock first. Go back there.
You can buy the whole town, and the Judge that goes with it.
Ryan.
I´m sorry.
- We´ll get Maddox.
- Yes.
We´ll get Maddox.
My heart isn´t in it. God´s my witness, Jase, I wanted no more killing.
I could have bought that town with a whisper. Ryan´s right.
But not now.
Harvey´s death finished any chance of doing it without guns.
Damn you, Harvey.
- He´s in the saloon.
- Who is?
Which one has the words?
You´re the storekeeper.
Luther Harris, ain´t it?
Let me say them for you.
You want me out of your town.
What happened some other time, some other place, ain´t your trouble.
I´ve seen men like you in every town in the West.
You want the law to walk quiet. You don´t want it to put a hole in your pocket.
You take courage from each other and you come armed.
Well, there are enough of you.
All you need is one man with enough stomach to die first.
I´m not leaving till what I came for is done.
So if you plan to do anything about it, do it now or go home.
How much?
- For the meal?
- Two bits.
Jesus, I thought for sure that...
* l´m thinking of sweet Lena Clare
* With deep-blue eyes and cornflower hair...
Good evening, Cotton.
Lucas.
Cards.
- A dollar a point?
- You know I can´t run that high, Lucas.
You got my note for more than I can ever pay, and still you wanna play.
I´m not calling in your note.
I´m not a great believer in the milk of human kindness.
You got a rope on the man who owes you.
Hit me.
Yours.
You got a weight on your back, Cotton.
- That the gossip?
- I´ve heard.
Besides, you´ve been here last night and tonight.
- You´re not an indulgent man, so...
- So?
- A man´s pleasure talks a lot.
- Now, ain´t that pretty?
Hit me.
May I be of service, Cotton?
I got me a mess, Lucas, and I haven´t got enough long boot to step out of it.
- Let´s play cards.
- Well, Cottontail Ryan.
Cottontail Ryan.
- You wanted something, Dekker?
- Yeah, I want something.
I want some more of your cheap whisky.
The service in your place stinks.
Then you´re a damn fool to come here.
He smells of trouble.
I´m all right.
Maddox!
Maddox!
I´m calling you out, Maddox.
- We´ve no quarrel, Crowe.
- I´m gonna kill you, Maddox.
- I´m not gonna fight you, boy.
- Stand.
I don´t plan on dying for no reason.
Ease up.
You cheap little gunslinger. You set me up.
- So help me God.
- Go for your gun.
- You want a chance? Go ahead.
- I don´t know nothing about those shots.
It came from over there.
My town, Maddox.
* Some folks like to sigh, some folks do, some folks do
* Some folks like to die, but that´s not me or you
* Long live the merry, merry heart that laughs by night and day
* Like the queen of mirth, no matter what some folks say
Drop it. Get up.
Come on.
Oh dear, oh dear.
Next time I see you, l´ll kill you.
God knows I got reason enough to wanna see you dead, Maddox, but I hate back-shooters.
If you got nowhere important to go, I got a bottle in that desk.
- Dekker´s on your list.
- He a Bronson hand?
Yeah.
Stays close to Choctaw Lee.
Choctaw´s a gun hand.
Fast and likes his work.
Dekker´s a shadow walker. Walks big with Choctaw, but a back-shooter inside.
I knew it´d be him. I saw him in town earlier.
Thanks, Ryan.
I owe you something, too. I feel good.
I remember you at Fort Bliss.
That´s my trouble. Everybody remembers me at Fort Bliss.
That´s all I got, Maddox.
A bunch of yesterdays.
It´s a long ride down from the high country, with stops all the way down.
In Abilene I ran. In Acadia
City I hid in a cellar.
In Monmouth the Loring brothers made me eat dirt.
What keeps pushing you?
I´ve been a lawman for 20 years.
What stops you running sand inside?
I guess the question doesn´t arise.
After killing Stenbaugh,
Bronson´ll come for you.
It´s always the same.
You post a man, he has to come into town to prove he´s a man.
Or you kill a man and he´s got a friend or a kin Just has to come against you.
And for no reason. No reason that makes any sense.
And it don´t matter a damn to the man already in the ground.
Nobody wins.
You can stop it. Ride out tomorrow.
It´s not a private matter with me.
The law. The honest ones carry it hard and clean all their lives.
Behind their backs, the others buy it, sell it, dirty it, tie it into knots.
Who lives longer, Maddox?
I was bringing in a killer when the shoot-up happened.
I could have chased a few tracks and let the matter drop.
But l´m the law in Bannock. Anybody who goes against the law goes against me.
I don´t know any other way.
How many more for one old man?
I don´t call the numbers.
I never drew first on a man in my life. That´s the only way to stay clean.
You play it by the rules.
Without the rules, you´re nothing.
- Bronson won´t come alone.
- I didn´t figure he would.
- You think he sent Dekker. He didn´t.
- I don´t know that. Do you?
I know Bronson.
Either way, it don´t matter. Good night, Ryan.
Let me go, Cotton. Let me go.
What´s the matter with you,
Ryan? Let me outta here!
You´re through, Ryan. Bronson´s gonna walk you into the ground.
You´re all through, Cottontail.
Calculate you got about ten minutes, back-shooter.
It´ll take me five to get to Maddox and Maddox five to get saddled.
He´d appreciate a little hunting.
Or I could gun you down, trying to escape. In the back.
- You won´t be...
- Back-shooter.
Any time you want out... you Just call.
Hold on, Crowe. You look like you got your teeth set on edge, boy. Now, move.
- I didn´t know nothing about Dekker.
- You don´t even interest me.
- Where´s your horse?
- Tied up behind the stables.
Listen to me, Ryan. I didn´t know about Dekker. You ask him.
Maddox called my name down in front of everybody. I ain´t afraid of him.
You would be if you had brains enough to spit.
- I figure l´m faster than him.
- Keep walking.
Every town Maddox has worked, the ground is full of men who were faster.
- Well, I really am. I aim to prove it, too.
- It makes a great epitaph.
You may be faster or better with a gun, but Maddox would kill you. That´s a fact.
You´d be staring up at nothing before your gun even got clear.
I know what l´m talking about, Crowe.
You might not rate me very high, but I know men like Maddox.
You´d ride a man to hell, wouldn´t you, Jered?
Hello, Lucas.
Whose day for choosing is it, Price or Adams?
- You know this Adams?
- I know him.
What kind is he?
I wouldn´t know. But I know what you´re doing is wrong, Maddox.
You were wrong in San
Acoma. You´re wrong here.
- Not from where I stand.
- You can´t see from where you stand.
- I didn´t wanna wake you.
- Where were you?
Over at Vern´s place. Sorry.
- Where are you going?
- Go back to bed, Laura.
Where are you going,
Hurd? I wanna know.
- Go back to bed, will you, please?
- You´re running, aren´t you, Hurd?
- Do you have to, Laura?
- No, I don´t have to.
Damn you. Always gotta push my face in it, you and this God-cursed land.
I´m running. Does that make you happier?
You said you´d give yourself up.
- That was before Harv was killed.
- I´m talking about you, Hurd.
I don´t care about Harvey Stenbaugh.
He doesn´t make any difference.
- Harv Stenbaugh was my friend.
- You hated him.
He never cared about anything unless it had the Bronson name to it.
Lying bitch.
You´re a nobody, Just a little nobody to them.
- I owe Vince everything l´ve got.
- You owe him what?
This piece of dirt that wouldn´t grow weeds?
And Harvey kept you on your knees saying thank you.
Hurd, they Just don´t care.
But you do?
Yes.
That´s not what I see every time I look at you.
You know what I see? I see
´´You´re not much, Hurd Price.´´
Not a man like all the men you´ve known.
I didn´t mean that.
Yes, you did.
And maybe you´re right.
Maybe that is what´s in my face.
I don´t think so. I´ve tried, Hurd.
And I don´t wanna see you dead.
I can´t go in alone, Laura.
The others won´t go in now, not to surrender.
Here´s Vern.
But Maddox promised nothing would happen to you.
What did you promise him?
I´ll be back.
When you turn around, keep your arms straight out from the body.
I told you the next time
I saw you, l´d kill you.
I knew nothing about Dekker.
- So you said.
- It´s true.
I Just wanted you to know.
- You ride for Bronson?
- Yeah, I ride for him.
Does he send you out to do his killing?
No. And he didn´t send me out here this morning, neither.
You Just took it upon yourself.
What for, a pat on the head?
- You killed Harvey Stenbaugh.
- You´ve got a bad memory, son.
- Stenbaugh had it in mind to kill me.
- He didn´t have a chance.
You don´t even care, do you, Maddox?
No. No, I don´t care.
You say he didn´t have a chance.
He went for his gun first. When he does that, he uses up all his chances.
- Do I have to keep my arms up here?
- Till I say different.
You liked Stenbaugh?
I´m sorry, Crowe, but he had a lot of chances.
He didn´t have to come into town.
He didn´t have to cross the street.
He could have given himself up.
- You wouldn´t have done no different.
- You´re wrong.
I wouldn´t put living down on cheap pride.
You can drop your arms.
Still plan on trying to kill me?
I don´t know. But I ain´t afraid of you.
I never said you were.
- Any fish in that stream?
- Some natives and some bullheads.
- Hungry?
- I didn´t come out here...
Having breakfast ain´t gonna make us friends.
- You got another line?
- In the saddlebag.
Ryan thinks you´re pretty good. Says you could kill me any time you wanted to.
I say different. I think l´m faster.
Are you asking me who´s faster or whether I could kill you if I chose to?
Because if it´s the second, the answer is yes.
You´re pretty damn sure.
I´m pretty damn sure.
You think it´s a game, don´t you? A contest between gentlemen.
You ever kill a man, Crowe?
You´re a cowman. You carry a side gun for protection. Snakes.
You learn to use it sometimes fairly well.
Sometimes you become really good.
But you´re still a cowman.
I´m a lawman. You know what a lawman is, Crowe?
He´s a killer of men. That´s what the Job calls for.
There are nicer ways to put it, but it reads the same.
That´s the difference between us, and it´s all the difference I need.
Maddox!
Being fast don´t count for much.
It´s what you learn in the trade.
You read a man.
You believe me, about last night?
I don´t think you´d trail a man so hard so early in the morning Just to tell a lie.
If you´re heading for Vern
Adams´ place, expect trouble.
He´ll be waiting.
- Morning, Mayor.
- Morning, Marshal.
- Nice morning.
- Just a minute, Marshal.
- He´s left town.
- Who?
- He rode out this morning, I heard.
- We wanna be sure he don´t come back.
I Just come from the minister and the churchgoing women.
It seems you´ve all got the same complaint.
But none of you have any reason for me to post Maddox out of town.
I told you we were wasting our time. He´s running scared of Maddox.
What we need is some real vigilante talk.
I heard you tried that once, then went scuttling back to your wives.
Maybe if you keep trying, you´ll find some brave man to shoot Maddox in the back.
Now I suggest you fine, upright gentlemen go about your business.
If you can´t keep the dirt off the street, Ryan, we can. And we will.
You´re all mouth, Luther, mouth and gut wind.
You won´t do much more than scratch yourself.
Look, down there.
What is it, Vern?
Maddox.
- What are you gonna do?
- End it here.
- You sure it´s Maddox?
- I´m sure.
- We could get through the pass.
- I said if he came after me, l´d kill him.
Jesus! Wait!
Seven unmarked with the
Wolf Creek bunch, Mr Bronson.
- Mark ´em.
- Some of them´ll be Adams´s.
Cut out his brand and give them to him.
- What do you mean, you don´t know?
- I Just don´t know.
- You knew last night.
- Did l?
I can´t figure you, Crowe. You ain´t scared of him, so what is it?
Maybe I Just don´t think it´s the right way to do things.
Maybe I don´t think it´s my fight. I Just don´t know.
Maybe I don´t think it should take four or five guns to go against one man.
- He murdered Harvey.
- I know what happened, Jase.
I was there, remember?
- I thought we were friends.
- We are.
And I didn´t say I wouldn´t.
I Just wanna think on it.
Well, you´d better think right... if you wanna ride for this brand.
Your run is over, mister. Drop your rifle.
Now the side gun.
Walk ahead.
That´s far enough.
Turn around and sit.
- You Price or Adams?
- Adams.
Keep one thing in mind, Adams. Make it difficult, you´re a dead man.
Let´s go.
How´d you know who I was?
I was in town when you brought in Corman´s body.
- You thought you were better than him.
- No, I didn´t.
I didn´t kill anybody that night, and I can´t afford the time to go back and stand trial.
I got 100 head and nobody but a woman and my old dog to hold down my place.
I´d have nothing to come back to.
You have no right to take that from me.
Drop it.
I told you to drop it.
What do you want, Price?
I Just come by to pay my respects, Vince.
- When´s the burying?
- Soon.
I´d appreciate it if I could attend.
- You´ll be welcome.
- Can I stay, Vince?
Just for the night, I mean.
You must excuse me. She´ll show you to your room.
Thanks, Vince.
When are you going after that Maddox?
When the dead are buried.
He needs killing.
No man needs killing.
I was only thinking of Harv.
We´re all thinking of Harv.
It took guns to get this land, guns to keep it, guns to make things grow.
The guns that pride called out.
And each time we buried the cost.
I´ll see you, Price, at the burying.
I wouldn´t think a few beef and a scrub ranch would be worth dying for, mister.
We´re leaving.
O omnipotent God, alone and unbending in thy heaven, accept with mercy into thy
Judgment this thy child.
Moulded from the cold shard, and fired with a soul warmed in thy presence, comes forth man.
To struggle and move, unbowed, through this harsh world alone.
To be tested by life.
To be confused by passion.
To be tempted and brought down by evil.
To seek for the light that the soul knows and never turns away from, and then to return from which he came, again, alone.
To stand in all finality before thy gaze and give account.
Such is man´s destiny.
And from the hardness comes forth a purity that soft men can never find.
Such a man was this, our brother, who now we bury here.
- Amen.
- (all) Amen.
And now let us each man unto his own God pray.
And now let us sing unto the Lord.
* A mighty fortress is our God
* A bulwark never failing...
We should have gone together, Harv.
* Our helper, he, amid...
Hush!
He´s not here. I´m alone. He´s run.
Got a prisoner here that needs a bit of care. Got a hole in him.
Vern, where´s Hurd?
He´s run free, Laura.
- Can you get the bullet out?
- It´ll have to be cut out through the back.
- You can put him in the bed.
- He goes outside.
- Get up.
- He´s hurt bad.
Someday l´ll get a second chance at you, and I won´t miss.
Don´t push it, Adams.
I´ve got some food warming.
How do you like the Price farm?
Over there we grow corn... for the weevils.
And out in back the potatoes fried black in the ground from the sun.
We do own a few head of stock to keep the bore-fly happy and the crows.
It´s not much, but I guess it´s more than you got, Jered.
Are you married to this Price fella?
No preachers and no flowers.
But l´m his woman, Jered.
That food will be done now.
- Does he have to stay out there all night?
- He does.
- You haven´t changed much.
- Not much.
I hear Canyon City is a ghost town.
Digging´s dried up.
The golden promise.
Well, it had a good run for its money.
Remember Bucky? Where´s Bucky now?
He´s dead. Charlottesville.
Somebody named Yancey, I heard.
Buck tried to take him in, gave him too much edge, I guess.
And Joe Wilmot?
Him, too. Shot in the back.
Ben Tilson, Luther Thompson,
Bill Chrysler. All gone.
- Jack Horn will never walk again.
- I´m sorry, Jered.
A lot of candles to light.
- Can I take something out to Vern?
- Go ahead.
Get me something to cut loose, and a gun if you´ve got one.
- Please, Laura.
- No, Vern. He´ll kill you.
No, he´ll go after Hurd next, maybe kill him.
With a gun and him not expecting it, I could stop him.
Eat your food. I´ll get you another blanket.
Promise me that you won´t try to kill Maddox, that you´ll Just go.
He´d come after me.
It´s turned colder. Can I take him another blanket?
Laura.
Thanks for supper.
Promise me, Vern, that you´ll go. Just go.
I got no more run in me.
If you get me a gun, l´ll have more than a better chance to get him.
He´ll check me again before he beds down.
He won´t expect nothing.
You´ve got to.
I was gonna give it to him.
Do you wanna know why I was gonna give him the gun?
He´s hurt. He´s a friend.
There are a lot of reasons.
I wanted to because of you.
Because there´s nothing soft in you, nothing forgiving.
Even this damn land doesn´t hold a man down as hard as you do.
What made you change your mind?
It wouldn´t make any difference.
You´d kill him or go after him, or he´d kill you.
I didn´t want that.
The sword of Gideon.
How do you see yourself, Jered?
What are you asking, girl?
For me to let Adams go? Forget about Price, Bronson and the rest?
- Would that be so terrible?
- You know I can´t.
You hold the law too high. You always did.
Would it make any difference if Just once...
You can´t play with it like that,
Laura. There is no ´´Just once´´.
Next time it might be a friend.
Or money in your hand.
Or maybe you get scared.
And then it becomes one more ´´Just once´´.
Soon you don´t know who you are.
You can´t break the rules, Laura.
The rules.
I forgot about the rules. You think they change the killings.
Because you never draw on a man first, do you think that really matters?
Do you know what they call you, Jered?
The widow-maker.
I´ve a harsh tongue, Jered Maddox, and then l´m always saying that l´m sorry.
And there´s no use your being out there wanting to be in here, and me being in here wishing you´d come to me.
You took a damn long time.
How did you get here?
Hm?
This place, I mean.
Oh.
After Canyon City, it was Tombstone.
Then I went north to Ellsworth.
That´s where I met Hurd.
And he brought me here.
Why do you stay?
I´ve used up too many places.
Besides, I owe Hurd.
He´s kind and tender when there´s time to be kind and tender.
He left you here.
He´s frightened. It´s a terrible thing to be frightened, Jered.
You don´t leave a man like Hurd much.
Come back with me.
Would you quit?
I´ve thought of it.
25 years. All you´ve got is a gun and not enough ground to throw over you.
Come back to Bannock.
I´ve always loved you, Jered.
But I would rather have this dead land and Hurd Price than the cold waiting that l´d have with you.
Do you still carry that whistle thing?
- You mean the flute?
- Do you?
In the saddlebag.
Play me something.
Any free land around here?
I asked you a question, mister.
Only high up. South of the river there´s some for the buying.
Good land?
Men like you don´t buy land, Maddox.
You don´t buy it and you don´t work it.
Do you want me to handle this myself, Mr Bronson?
No.
Find Crowe?
Quit. Rode out earlier with his stuff.
This locks in with you, Hurd.
Are you going to ride with us?
A man´s gotta stand sometime!
- I´ll Just get my things.
- Get Price an animal.
You need some breakfast.
I hear you might have trouble from the citizens.
Harris?
It seems he´s trying to throw a lot of sand.
What does a man like that want, Lucas?
The name. He hungers for the name in bold, proud letters.
When Maddox comes back, you could have big trouble, Cotton.
If Maddox comes back.
He´ll come back. You might need help.
I tell you, Lucas, if I had somewhere to run to, l´d run.
But I don´t, so l´ll stand.
And the storekeeper and his friends?
I don´t know.
You knew Maddox from before?
You never said.
- From where?
- Claremont, Canyon City, San Acoma.
- Friends?
- Used to be.
And now?
There´s been trouble between us. I killed a man in San Acoma.
Maddox called it against me, posted me out of town.
He called it wrong, but... that´s how it stayed.
Harris and his friends don´t have the tail for gunplay.
Such a man was this, our brother,
Marc Corman, who now we bury here.
- Amen.
- (all) Amen.
Better get him to a doctor.
- Who is that woman?
- Corman´s widow.
Murderer!
Tell Moss and Cobden to meet at my store.
How? That´s what I wanna know, Luther.
The next time he steps into the street. You and Moss upstairs.
Totts, Hersham and me here in the store and out in the alley.
You mean cut him down, Just like that?
-Just like that. Does that bother you?
We´re not gunfighters. We can´t do it straight out.
It´s not as if it was murder, him a killer an´ all. More like a hanging.
He´s standing on the neck of this town, and that´s for damn sure.
- What´s the matter, Cobden?
- I got no taste for it.
I had you down for a man.
You talk a big noise, Luther, but Maddox put water between your legs once before, and I think maybe the mould is set that way.
- Ryan?
- Be right out.
Doc says Adams can´t travel for a few days. He´s busted up inside.
When he gets better, let him go.
Tell him he can go back to his land. The others, too.
Tell ´em it´s finished.
I´m pulling out.
You? What happened out there?
Nothing happened.
A man like you doesn´t let go that easy, not for no reason.
I guess I Just looked around me.
Anyway, soon there´ll be no more towns like Bannock, towns that need a gun like mine.
I guess yours is the right way, Cotton.
Sit out the years, find a nice, quiet town, one that pays a bit of house toll.
Don´t do it my way,
Maddox. Quit clean.
- Buy you a drink?
- No, thanks.
Bronson Just rode into town. There´s four of ´em.
- Who´s with him?
- His son, Choctaw Lee and Hurd Price.
I´d say you bought more than you can chew this time.
You figure you got a say in this?
I wouldn´t wanna see you get it in the back.
We´ve done too many towns.
- You don´t owe me, Lucas.
- Well, let´s say I need the action.
You and I sit at the same table, Jered.
The virtuous need us, but they don´t like the smell.
(B)onSon) Maddox!
Damn fools. I´ll go out and talk to them.
Leave us be. Man gets caught in his own doing.
You can´t change what you are, and if you try, something always calls you back.
Cotton?
I can´t. I got no stomach for that kind of shooting any more.
- Which one is Hurd Price?
- The one on the end, next to the old man.
Watch Lee, on your right. He´s the gun hand.
Crowe!
Please let me talk to ´em, Maddox.
Jason and me were never in
Bannock. We went to Abilene.
Hear me out. Jason and me are friends.
I´ll kill you if I have to, Maddox.
No need to, son.
Whoa!
There´s been enough.
He´s going.
He killed Harvey.
You can´t let him go.
Maddox!
- It´s over, Jase.
- I don´t crawl.
- He´ll kill you.
- Get your hands off. I´m not afraid of him.
Harvey´d walk fire for you.
He´s my son, Maddox.
Don´t beg him.

[Gasps]
Oh, my God!
My daddy died that way.
Crawled off in the bushes and bled to death.
Maybe you were the cause.
Are you dyin', Mr. Yank?
Help me.
- What's your name, girl?
- Amelia.
But everybody calls me Amy.
I'm Corporal John McBurney, but everybody calls me McB.
- How old are you, Amy?
- Twelve.
Thirteen in September.
Old enough for kisses.
Don't give up now, Mr. Yank.
I mean, Mr. McB.
Just over there.
Miss Martha, that smoke's sure getting awful close.
You figure them Yanks is gonna burn this place down?
Hallie, don't talk that way. It's hard enough to get the girls to study.
Es-tu aujourd'hui a Paris?
I can't emphasize enough... that French is a smilin' language.
Le mari de Marie est ici aujourd'hui a Paris.
Abigail... you're not paying attention.
I'm sorry, Miss Edwina, but the war is soundin' so close.
Doris says, if the Yankees win... they'll rape every one of us.
[Amy] Miss Martha!
Miss Martha!
[Bell Ringing]
[Amy] Help!
Miss Martha!
[Amy] Help!
He's dyin'!
How did he get here?
By the grace of God, ma'am.
The grace of God in the form of this here child.
What were you doin' off the school grounds?
Just pickin' some mushrooms.
And I didn't notice how far...
You know the punishment for leaving the grounds.
Get him into the house.
Come and help me.
Lift.
[Amy] Miss Martha,
I couldn't leave him there to die.
Well, you wouldn't have had to worry about it.
There'd have been one less enemy soldier.
[McB] Corporal John McBurney.
66th New York.
I surrender to the prettiest Confederates...
[Janie] A real blue belly.
There's only one way to tell if he's a Yank.
- How's that?
- Take off his pants.
- Yanks have tails.
- Doris, stop that nonsense!
Amy, run out ahead and open up the door.
And then come back and tie the blue rag on the gate.
Go on!
You hear that?
The blue rag's a signal for our local patrollers.
We're gonna feel awful proud turnin' one over to them.
- Is he dead?
- Lizzie, why didn't you sound the alarm?
- You must have seen them crossin' the fields.
- I was readin'...
The lookout is not a readin' room.
Get back up on that widow's walk.
If you see any of our soldiers comin', let me know at once.
Let's put him down on the steps.
Careful.
There.
Doris, Abigail, get some sheets... and make up the divan in the music room.
I'll go put the water on to boil.
Amy, will you put the blue rag on the gate as you were told?
Couldn't we wait a bit for that?
His pulse is weak and he's lost a lot of blood.
Gallons and gallons, Miss Martha.
They'd take him away... even though he's half dead.
They're not likely to be by again today... and they'd wait until we'd dressed his wounds.
Will you do as I asked?
[Martha] If this war goes on much longer, I'll forget I ever was a woman.
The water's on to boil.
Y'all wastin' your time.
I say we fix his leg, turn him over to the patrol.
He'll die in prison just the same.
[Raven Cawing]
[Hallie] Mr. Yankee... there was enough iron in your leg to shoe a horse.
I'm afraid it's some time since the corporal had a bath.
I noticed.
You ladies leave.
I'll get some clean water and wash him down.
I'll fetch one of my brother's nightshirts.
Come, Edwina.
I thought so.
Is he going to die?
Some day.
But for now, he's quite all right.
I don't want anyone poking in here or lurking in the halls.
There's lots of mending to be done.
Into the parlor, all of you.
Pay no attention to them, Amy.
Did the ant kill the caterpillar?
No, they joined together and dragged him underground.
Probably to eat him.
I don't see what this has to do with that Yank you brought here.
I do.
The Yank's an intruder, just like the caterpillar.
And you should never have brought him here.
- I agree. He's probably a spy.
- I doubt that, Janie.
Miss Edwina, aren't you afraid of that blue belly?
No.
It's bad manners to call him a blue belly.
He has a name.
Corporal John McBurney.
Call him by it.
I call him Mr. McB.
And I think he's ever so handsome.
I got him cleaned good to the waist.
I'll lift him... and you put the nightshirt on him.
- All right, give me the other arm.
- Yes, Miss Martha.
Help me.
Hold the sleeve and hold it up.
Yes, Miss Martha.
Now, pull off his pants.
Go ahead, Miss Martha. He's not made no different than your brother.
I have asked you never to speak of my brother.
Sorry, Miss Martha,
I didn't mean nothin'.
The nightshirt recalled
Master Miles to me.
Surprisin' it didn't you too. Surprisin' you brang this Yank into your house... him bein' a man and all.
- I didn't want to.
- [Clanging]
Soldiers on the road.
They're our boys.
- All right, Lizzie.
- Should I go back up?
No, I should have had you relieved before.
- Janie, I believe it's your watch.
- May we go greet 'em?
No... don't want them to see you girls.
Come along, girls.
Captain.
- What's the news?
- We won. Grant's retreatin'.
Oh, thank God.
Get back here, Yank!
- No!
- Shoot him!
Hold your fire!
Get him and throw him in the wagon.
[Captain]
He was wantin' to be shot.
Prefers a quick death to a slow death in Fayette Prison.
That's where the poor devils are headed.
How many young ladies are here?
We have six students and a teacher.
I sure wouldn't advertise it if I were you.
Oh, you mean on the sign?
A lot of Yanks are separated from their units.
They're roamin' the woods and they're desperate.
You think Miss Martha is gonna tell 'em about Mr. McB?
'Course she'll tell 'em.
That's why she went out there.
So, take care, ma'am.
- Captain! Captain...
- Yes, ma'am?
Our prayers go with you.
Thank you, ma'am.
Forward!
They're goin' on.
What name do you go by?
Hallie.
Well, you can call me McB.
Yank'll do fine.
You and I oughta be friends, Hallie.
How do you figure that?
Well, we're both kinda prisoners here, aren't we?
With one difference, Mr. Yank.
I can run.
I love you, Mr. Crow... but until your wing's mended, it's for your own good.
[Martha]
You can lower it now.
I couldn't have operated this school without you.
- I'm very grateful to you.
- I'm the one to be grateful.
You've given me the only home
I have, Miss Martha.
Even after the war is over, it'll still be difficult for years to come.
I'll have to devote myself to runnin' the farm.
I'd like you to concentrate on building the school up again.
You've become very dear to me, Edwina.
And I'm prepared to make you a partner.
And provide in my will that you'll inherit full ownership.
Miss Martha... that's unbelievably generous.
I don't know what to say.
Well, there's not an ounce of generosity in it.
I need somebody capable and responsible.
You're my guarantee that the school will continue... to bear my name and maintain my standards.
I don't know what to s...
That's wonderful.
You know, you should pray for the North to win.
Why?
You don't like being a slave, do you?
No, do you?
Me?
Oh, I'm nobody's slave.
You mean, you just went out and got yourself shot up...
'cause you like being shot up?
Sometimes a man's gotta do things... he doesn't particularly like.
Not if he's free, he don't.
And you white folks ain't killin' each other because you care about us niggers.
A white man's the same everywhere in this world.
You should say that men are the same everywhere, no matter what color.
Same as a beautiful...
What's goin' on?
Sounds like maybe they're makin' you a coffin.
How come you're not turnin' our Yankee in?
In his condition, he'd die in that Fayette Prison.
This'll hold him till he's better.
I could probably kick those shutters open with my bad leg.
Perhaps, Corporal, but not without bein' heard.
Girls!
[Amy] Good night.
Back to your beds, instantly.
At least it gives her an opportunity... to learn what a man's body feels like.
Go back to your room.
- How is he?
- He has a fever.
You must be tired.
Wouldn't you like a chance to go to your closet?
I might sponge parts of him you wouldn't.
Oh!
I knew what you were the minute you came to this school.
A hussy is a hussy.
You come in here again... and you'll find your face in a bucket of water!
Do I smell eggs for breakfast?
Yes, Miss Edwina.
Hallie says Mr. McB brought us luck.
Those hens finally laid some eggs.
You look very pretty, Edwina.
The corporal seems to be having an effect on all of us.
How is the corporal this morning?
Hungry.
How long is he gonna stay in the music room?
Till he is well enough to turn over to the patrollers.
I wanna practice my harp, but I can't with an enemy in the same room.
So that's the answer.
I always wondered what it would take to make you practice.
Hello.
What's your name?
Edwina.
- Mine is...
- Corporal John McBurney.
Now, how'd you know that?
You said so when you came here.
Did I?
Oh, I must've forgotten all about that.
You know, Edwina...
I got the strangest feeling that I'm a prisoner... in some sort of girls' school.
It is a girls' school.
Well, you are an enemy soldier.
Are you the head of the school?
Lady in the portrait there.
Miss Martha Farnsworth.
- Who's the man with her?
- Her brother, Miles.
Where's he?
He disappeared.
He's presumed dead.
There's no man around here at all?
Well...
I sure thank providence for sending me here... rather than to one of your prisons.
I wish it were up to me what happens to you, but it isn't.
Miss Martha will decide.
Bye.
Well, there's the little darlin' that saved my life.
Come on in. Sit down.
I can't.
Your room is out-of-bounds.
Oh, I told Randolph all about you.
The patrol.
But even if I sounded the alarm,
Miss Martha wouldn't stop them.
It's treason!
Not tyin' on the blue rag to signal the patrol is treason.
Damn!
Damn! Damn!
[Harpsichord]
That was very nice.
You said there were no men around here. Who's Randolph?
Oh, I forgot about Randolph.
I'm sure you'll meet him.
Who is he?
Randolph is a turtle.
He's a pet of Amy's.
Oh.
Don't go.
You may leave now... and your soldiers might come or something. I may never see you again.
I don't even know your last name.
Dabney.
- Why are you afraid of me, Edwina?
- I'm not.
Not really.
I mean, it has nothing to do with you.
[McB] It's just that
I'm a Yankee now.
- I don't suppose Yankees are any different than other men.
- Oh, I see.
So you're just afraid of men in general?
Not afraid, I just don't... trust them.
Any of them.
It sounds like some man didn't treat you too kindly.
Only I would've bet that you'd never been in love.
Too bad you couldn't have bet.
You'd have won.
Then how'd you get your unfair opinion of men?
I'd rather not talk about it.
We won't, then.
How long have you been at this school?
Since I was fifteen.
Seven years.
Except for Sunday church,
I've rarely been away...
- from the school grounds for all those years.
- I wonder... if sometimes you don't think of yourself as a sleeping beauty in a castle... waiting for a prince to free you... with a kiss.
- I wish we didn't have to send him to prison.
- We've no choice.
Harboring the enemy is a crime.
A very serious crime.
- You must be Miss Farnsworth.
- I am.
I was beginning to think you were avoiding me.
I wanted to thank you for all you've done, ma'am.
I don't want your thanks.
I just want you well enough to turn over to the authorities.
- You certainly don't mince words. I like that.
- Do you indeed?
Think it makes any difference to me whether you like it or not?
No, I guess it doesn't, but I still can't help being grateful.
Don't be.
It's simply a matter of ethics.
Something you probably wouldn't understand.
Well, you might be surprised, ma'am.
It was ethics that got me wounded in the first place.
How so?
Well, you see, ma'am,
I'm a Quaker.
And I don't... carry weapons into battle,
I carry bandages.
And my company, we were fighting in this thicket... and there was this wounded rebel officer... who was trying to crawl away from the fire.
My duty was to stay with my men... but my ethics wouldn't let me.
I carried that reb to safety.
That's why I got shot.
Now, my conscience does bother me... because I should've stayed with my own troops.
I feel like I deserted them, you might say.
Do your hands hurt you terribly?
Well, there's nothing more painful than burns, ma'am.
A few bottles left in my father's wine cellar.
If the pain gets too great,
I'll ask Hallie to bring you some.
Does seem like a good occasion, and I would love some wine.
It was offered for your pain, not for your pleasure!
It's just that sometimes the two do go together.
Corporal McBurney... you are not our guest, but a somewhat unwelcome visitor.
We don't propose to entertain you.
I don't expect it. It's just that
I've been at war a long time.
It's been months since I've seen a woman's face.
You'll find I'm easily amused.
If you get any ideas of tryin' to amuse yourself with any of the ladies...
Wait just a minute...
You'll find yourself out on that road so fast you won't know what happened.
I'm not that kind of man.
You know that.
I know nothing of the kind.
How long does it take you, ma'am... to get to know someone?
To get to know me?
You'll never find out.
You won't be here that long.
We'll continue our study of the Gospel according to Saint Luke, chapter 11.
"And it ca..."
- [Whispering]
- Can't you wait until after Bible reading?
I really can't, Miss Martha.
All right, hurry back.
Chapter 11.
"And it came to pass, that as he was praying in a certain place...
"when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him...
Lord, teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples."
Well, well.
I just thought I'd introduce myself proper. I'm Carol.
Carol, that's about the nicest introduction I've ever had.
And to the prettiest girl.
How old are you?
Seventeen, but I know a lot more than girls my age.
Oh, I'll bet you do.
Gotta get back to...
Bible readin'.
Say a prayer for me, will you?
I would, but I've no idea what you want.
The butter churned out to a good five pounds.
That ought to trade for a sack of flour.
And we need flour bad.
Sweetener, too, Miss Martha.
If he doesn't have sugar, take molasses or honey.
You talk as though I didn't know how to barter with Phil MacPherson.
If he has 'em, I'll get 'em.
Hallie, you might shave
Corporal McBurney.
I'm tired of lookin' at that stubble.
Bye, Miss Martha.
Good-bye, Miss Martha.
Mr. McB?
Mr. McB?
- Good mornin'.
- Good morning, little friend.
Feelin' better, Mr. McB?
Well, I'm a little bit bed weary, that's all.
There's a pair of crutches in the barn.
Been there a long time.
Should I get 'em for you?
Again, I'd be indebted to you, Amy.
Can you see him?
So that's Randolph, huh?
Yes. And I love him very much.
Not as much as you do me, I hope.
As much, but different.
Catch some flies for him to eat...
- while I'm gone.
- Bye.
If livin' was a thing that money could buy
Don't you know the rich would live, Lord, before we die
All my troubles
Is that all you're gonna give?
Guess you're dryin' up like the rest of us women around here.
What you after in this barn, Miss Amy?
Those crutches.
For Mr. McB.
You get permission from Miss Martha?
Well, I think we should refuse to work the garden... till Miss Martha stops givin' food to the enemy of the Confederacy.
The Bible says,
"Love thy enemy."
Can't let a man like that starve to death.
Ain't enough of them now.
Miss Doris... that thing in your hand is for hoein', not leanin'.
It's nigger work!
And it's ruinin' my hands.
Why, I'll never be able to play the harp again.
That nigger work is what feed us.
And if we don't get enough of it... you're goin' where you can play your harp your whole livelong day.
[Laughter]
[Humming]
Like to suck a raw egg while
I shave you? Lt'll give you energy.
Sure. Thanks.
You get the thanks. Those hens hadn't laid for months 'fore you came.
You must got rooster blood in you.
Judging by my boots and uniform,
I don't have any blood in me.
Miss Martha said
I should shave you.
But I ain't so sure.
I don't think the Lord wanted a man's face all smooth like a baby's bottom.
That's why he gave him whiskers.
- Might be a sin to shave that growth off.
- Then don't do it.
Sinning oughta be saved for much more important things.
I better shave you.
Miss Martha give me my orders.
Not the Lord.
And even without whiskers... you wouldn't look half bad for a white man.
I like hearin' you laugh, Hallie.
My Ben used to say that.
Who's Ben, your husband?
No, we weren't rightly married, but we sure loved each other.
- Did he die?
- Don't know.
He run off a long time back.
Miss Martha's brother... he decided to sell Ben off.
So, Ben run away.
So, he finally got us separated all the same.
Listen, Hallie, you help me get away from here... and I'll try to find out what happened to your Ben.
Even if I have to go to General Grant personally.
You trust me now, Hal.
I'll think on it, Mr. Yank.
Oh, let me help you.
You all right?
Oh, yeah. I just overdid it a little, that's all.
Well, sit down.
- There.
- Thank you.
- All right?
- Won't you sit down for a minute?
No, I can't.
I have a class in a minute.
Just for that minute, then, please. Come on.
Well...
I woke up this morning wondering if you could possibly be... as lovely and sweet as you were last night.
But now I see you're even prettier than I remembered.
Edwina, one way or the other
I'm gonna have to leave here... pretty soon.
There isn't time enough to get to know each other in the normal way.
So I've got to ask you something
I wouldn't ordinarily ask you.
See, I've never felt this way about anybody before.
I mean, you're somebody
I've always wanted to meet.
And if I'm gonna be in prison... or somewhere else,
I don't want to just keep... thinking and hoping, if nothing's gonna happen.
I mean, if I'm just another
Billy Yank enemy...
You're not.
I like you very much.
[Lizzie] Miss Martha's back!
- How did you get those crutches, Corporal?
- I brung them to him.
You had no business doing it without being told. Who let him out of the room?
I was told to shave him and it was too dark in that boarded-up room.
Well, at least it's some improvement.
I'm sorry I let her shave me, ma'am.
I've always felt the Lord didn't intend... for a man's face to be smooth as a baby's bottom.
- Go unload the buggy.
- Yes, ma'am.
And thanks to you,
I've got most of my strength back.
What do you think of that?
That it's a foolish waste of energy.
Come help me bring in the supplies.
I'd be glad to, ma'am.
There's a lot of things
I could do... to repay you for savin' me.
There's just about nothin'
I don't like about farming.
And I have a great respect for land.
It really used to grieve me when our outfit was movin' this way.
And I could see what this war was doin' to this fine land.
Grieves me too. I used to enjoy ridin' through our fields... seein' them rich with crops.
There are things that could use a man's help.
Thank you, ma'am.
You won't regret it, I guarantee you.
There are enough of us to keep an eye on you during the day... but at night... we'll lock you up again.
Well, of course.
I'd expect that.
You can take the buggy now, Hallie.
You'll need some clothes.
Come on, Mae.
Can't have you hobbling around the girls in that.
Come on, Mae.
- I'll get you some things that belonged to my brother.
- You're an angel, ma'am.
An absolute angel.
Thank you.
You've been a great help.
[Edwina] The napkin should not be fastened at the neck.
It should be laid conveniently across the lap.
And one corner should be lifted to wipe the mouth.
Men who wear a mustache are obliged to manipulate a napkin in a vigorous manner...
Miss Edwina?
...which would be unpardonable in a lady.
- Yes?
- Permission to go to my closet?
- But nowhere else.
- Of course not.
Now, we will all demonstrate the proper use of a napkin.
Very nice.
- 'Morning.
- Well, good morning to you.
Games for two are more fun.
Oh, now you surprise me.
Never thought you'd be afraid to kiss a girl.
Well, my mother told me it might just stunt my growth.
Well, maybe your mama was right.
You are well-developed.
I'd have to say the same about you.
Well, it's not the same.
I mean your shoulders and arms, you seem to be all muscle.
I bet there's not a soft spot on you.
She's not in her room.
Not even in the music room as I expected.
But then, neither is the blue belly.
Doris will take charge.
You're obviously very hard to resist, Carol... but I'm not anxious to have my head on a chopping block.
What about later on tonight, when everybody's asleep?
What about it?
I just happen to have a room to myself.
In the attic.
Can you walk up stairs?
I suppose, but I couldn't walk through a locked door.
Oh, I forgot about that.
I just thought
I'd pay our guest a little visit.
He wanted to know what class you were teachin'.
And I told him etiquette.
And how to behave like a lady under all circumstances.
All that anger in those pretty green eyes?
I told you before,
I don't trust any man.
Did you ask her if she looks upon you as a Billy Yank enemy?
Or if she's waiting for a prince to awaken her with a kiss?
Now, come on, that's nonsense.
She doesn't mean a thing to me.
Just passing time, talking with her, that's all.
Same as my father said to my mother.
"They mean nothin' to me.
I was only amusin' myself."
Oh, so your father was the man?
No. No, Johnny.
I know how I feel.
If you don't feel the same way, just tell me.
You know how I feel.
When the war's over,
I'll come back and get you.
- Please, Johnny, don't say that unless you mean it.
- You know I mean it.
[Edwina] Oh. Oh, no.
Johnny, no. Oh.
[McB's Voice] When the war's over,
I'll come back and get you.
If you'll let me.
- Please, Johnny, don't say that unless you mean it.
- You know I mean it.
Oh. Oh, no.
Oh. Oh, I can't.
Not like this.
Not without being sure.
Maybe when the war's over.
It's just that I never have before.
Don't be angry.
If you still feel the same way...
There's riders out in front.
Maybe three or four of them.
It's probably just the patrollers.
Or the girl on lookout, she would've sounded the alarm.
- They've stopped.
- They often do.
They water their horses, and then they ride on.
I better get back before I'm missed.
Miss Martha!
Miss Martha!
Hold it, Yank!
Hell, I ain't no Yank.
Who are you?
What're you doin' here?
Hurry, Miss Martha!
Hurry!
I was wounded... on leave from Gregg's Texans,
Longstreet's Corps.
- How come you're not in uniform?
- How come you're not?
- What's going on there?
- We caught him.
Why, Sam Jepson!
This is my cousin you've heard me talk about.
- It's my cousin.
- Cousin Martha, I always figured you looked down... on the Texas side of the family.
It pleases me that you... that you talk about us.
Of course, I didn't say what I said about you.
Can you explain this,
Miss Farnsworth?
- No, I can't explain it.
- It was tied on the gates.
I've no idea.
Unless it was one of the girls as a joke.
[Jepson]
These aren't times for joking.
One of my men could've been killed, or your cousin.
I know, Sam.
The girl who's responsible will be severely punished.
Take my word for it.
Well, I do, ma'am.
Thank you, Sam.
I'm sorry this happened.
You were splendid, ma'am, absolutely splendid.
You were quite splendid yourself, Corporal.
Your accent was pure Texas.
I wonder who put this rag on the gate.
I don't know, but you can bet I didn't.
Now that you've got your strength back... there's no reason to serve your meals in bed.
You'll have supper with us tonight.
Whatever you say, ma'am.
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
[McB] I can't remember when...
I've ever been in such delightful company.
You young ladies are a fine tribute... to the excellence of your head mistress... to whom I will always be indebted.
- You needn't be.
- But I will, ma'am.
I used to make more use of my legs than most men.
Take dancing for instance.
I could wear out the arm of any fiddler.
If we had dancing here in the school...
I could teach the girls waltzes, reels, polkas.
[McB] Almost anything you could mention.
- Miss Martha, could we have a dance class?
- Yes, please?
- Can we?
- I'll take it under consideration.
We haven't had as lively a meal as this in a long time.
- I think it's disgraceful, eatin' with the enemy.
- So do I, Miss Martha.
You girls might have said something before supper.
- You may both be excused to go to your room.
- Ma'am, let them stay.
They're just voicing their patriotism.
Doris and Janie...
I admire your father fighting for the cause he thinks right.
If nobody's gonna finish those mushrooms, I could manage.
Please do, Corporal.
Amy picked them for you.
Thank you, Amy.
I'm particularly partial to mushrooms.
Now, I'm sorry... but I must turn to something unpleasant.
Today, somebody tied the blue rag...
Girls, into the kitchen.
Edwina, fetch the pistol.
It's in my room.
Hallie, go with them.
Hide yourself upstairs, Corporal.
If it's Union troops, you holler.
I'll make sure nothing happens to anyone.
- They're our soldiers.
- Thank God!
- Can you make it up the stairs?
- Yeah.
- I'll help him.
- No, you won't! Get in the kitchen.
[Pounding]
[Pounding]
- Let me have that pistol.
- No, I have to take it to Miss Martha.
- You care about what happens to me, don't ya?
- I don't want you shot.
[Pounding]
[Pounding]
Come in, Captain.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
That's all right, ma'am.
It's been a long time... since I've had to wait for such a pretty lady.
This vicinity's gonna be left unprotected.
Our boys gotta pull out for Champion's Hill... before them damn Yankees, beg your pardon... and secure the road to Vicksburg.
Why have you come here?
We heard about your school... and since we were scouting in this area... we decided to stop and see if we could be of any... assistance.
Thank you, Captain, but everything is fine here.
It seems to me as how you might be afraid of being molested by Yankees.
I could leave a couple of my boys to sleep in your barn.
That's generous, but it won't be necessary.
I don't mind staying with the ladies.
Y'all go on ahead.
I'll catch up.
You're very kind, but we cannot take you from your duties.
It seems to me as how it might serve some military purpose... for someone to stay behind, and kinda out of sight.
- That's right.
- I might stay myself.
Now, Scoggins, suppose you ride back and tell the colonel.
No, I cannot permit it.
One or two of you would be no protection.
Your presence here might draw attention to us... and provoke the Yankees into burning us down.
Good night, gentlemen.
Thank you for your concern.
I'd be right proud... to pay my compliments to them young ladies.
[Martha] That is very gentlemanly of you, Captain.
I'll tell them. Good night.
Come on, boys.
God bless you, gentlemen.
Good night.
It's all right.
They left.
I love you so much.
Were you scared, Miss Martha?
- I almost died, I was so scared.
- So was I.
Go up to your rooms.
I think it's treason to talk that way about our own boys.
[Amy] Oh, Doris, you think everything is treason.
Don't argue, girls. Hallie...
- bring a bottle of wine to the parlor.
- Yes, Miss Martha.
Today's been quite a strain.
Oh, give me the pistol.
[McB] Good night, young ladies.
[Girls] Good night, Mr. McB.
Good night, Mr. McB.
Will you come hear our prayers?
- I'm too excited to sleep.
- Me too.
Go on to your rooms.
I'll be there presently.
Oh, I see you can manage stairs.
You know, they leave the key in your door.
I could slip down and unlock it.
You'd find me much more interesting than Miss Edwina.
You little devil.
You're the one who tried to get me caught today.
Well... you shouldn't do things that make me jealous.
Would you care for some wine, Corporal?
- I'd be honored, ma'am.
- Do help yourself.
It's on the table.
I must say, you showed great courage tonight.
They were our soldiers.
There was no danger.
I think I know a little more about that than you do, ma'am.
And believe me, there was danger.
If you'd have shown any weakness... tonight's episode could've had a different ending.
I toast you.
You're a remarkable, beautiful woman.
Amy, you should've finished your prayers long ago.
I was praying for Mr. McB too.
[Janie] But it's wrong to pray for the enemy.
- My father says that God's on our side.
- So he is.
He's on the side of people everywhere.
No more talking.
Put out your candle, Amy.
- Good night, Miss Edwina.
- Good night.
I've been thinking, Corporal.
I've been thinking, Corporal.
This place needs a man, someone who knows farming.
How to handle farm hands.
Thinking about giving up the school, ma'am?
Oh, no.
But there won't be money for tuition, not for a long time.
But there will be money for anything we can grow.
Northern money.
When my brother and I ran this place... there were good northern markets for anything we could raise.
But... he isn't here now.
Never will be.
And I am?
Yes, you are.
Would you be interested in staying on here, Corporal?
Yes, I would.
Why were we all scared of our own soldiers?
All armies have some men who aren't nice.
Now get to sleep.
- Good night, Lizzie.
- Good night.
I want to take your brother's place, but I must warn you.
It won't be easy to act like a brother.
I'll try not to dictate... your personal behavior, Corporal.
And the joys we shared
As we tarried there
No lover has ever
[Footsteps]
[Giggling]
[Giggling]
[Giggling]
No!
Edwina, listen to me!
No, no, no!
You lying son-of-a-bitch!
You bastard!
You filthy lecher!
I hope you're dead!
Dead!
I hope you're dead!
Dead... dead.
[Gasping]
[Martha] I want all discussion of what happened tonight... to end now.
There are more urgent matters.
Do you think he's in much pain, Miss Martha?
[Martha] No, not after all the wine and laudanum we've given him.
He can't feel anything.
Why do you want him... in the dining room, Miss Martha?
I need him there to work on his leg.
[McB Mumbling]
His leg's not only fractured, the bone is splintered.
If the best doctors couldn't set it so it healed...
I certainly can't.
[McB] You're well-bosomed.
You stop your drunken chatter.
Now lift the harness and slide him on the table.
Don't be jealous about it.
You're well-bosomed too.
Sweet and ladylike.
So round and perky.
I hate you, Miss Martha!
Another teaspoon of laudanum should put him to sleep.
Give it to him.
[Amy Crying]
And now, Amy, you will go to your room... and you will not come out until you are told.
And if I ever want your opinion,
I'll ask for it!
I didn't say nothing.
I think you did.
I think you spoke very loudly!
Girls, go directly to your rooms.
Edwina, Hallie, Carol... stay here and don't take your eyes off him.
That shouldn't be hard for you to do.
I've reached a very difficult decision.
I hope it's the right one.
By this time tomorrow, his leg will be starting to mortify.
There's no death worse than one from gangrene... and I cannot let him die... inch-by-inch in screaming agony.
The only way to prevent that is to amputate.
- That mean you gonna cut off his leg?
- Yes.
But you ain't a doctor.
If he lives and blames you for making him a cripple, what you gonna say?
He would rather lose a leg than his life.
Can you be sure he'd die if you don't?
I'm sure.
What if he dies as a result of the operation?
My conscience would be clear.
It wouldn't be if I let him die... and did nothing to try and save him.
I suppose if we made the cut... above the popliteal division instead of below... we'd have fewer arteries to contend with.
There's goin' to be bleeding no matter where you cut.
We see a vessel bleeding, we tie it with thread.
If you're going to do it, do it and be done with it!
Turn his face away from me.
There is some frailty in you.
Dear Lord, we ask that you bless our efforts.
Mr. McB, are you coming around?
Amy.
I can tell it's night... when the stars come out.
And I can tell it's morning... when your freckles come in the room.
I must tell Miss Martha.
Miss Martha!
Miss Martha!
Miss Edwina!
- Come along and watch.
Hallie's going to bury it.
- Bury what?
What do you think?
The leg!
He's awake, Miss Martha.
Ladies.
I know you're expecting an apology... and you certainly deserve it... after the way
I abused your hospitality.
But first could you fix the splints... on my leg?
- It hurts so much.
- There are no splints.
How do you fix a broken leg without splints?
The pain is...
We saved your life, and you complain of pain.
But nobody dies of a broken leg.
If gangrenous, they do.
We had a choice:
Either let you die in agony... or remove the leg.
You're just trying to punish me.
The Lord knows I deserve it... but I know my legs are all right.
I can feel 'em all the way down to my toes.
It's a shock.
It has to be.
- But you're too intelligent...
- You dirty bitch!
Just because I didn't go to your bed.
Just because
I went to someone else's bed.
I should have let you die screaming!
Why should I have denied myself after all I'd been through?
You wanted to be so much the goddamn lady!
The virgin bitch.
Get out of here.
Get out of here!
[Distant Singing]
What do you think it is,
Miss Martha?
[Martha] It's a Union soldier camp.
Don't tell the other girls.
No need to frighten them.
There's nothing we can do.
[Amy] A cypress root is hard to cut, but it'll last forever.
That's why I picked it.
I found the tree... not far from where your soldiers are camped.
Union troops?
Where?
About three-miles north.
I haven't heard any sounds of any battle.
Must mean the rebels have retreated.
That's what Miss Martha said.
- Mr. McB?
- Hmm?
About Carol.
Yeah, what about her?
She said... you forced your way into her room and...
And that you...
Do you believe her?
No... but you were in her room. Why?
And she was all naked.
And I thought you loved me.
And I do, Amy.
Amy, go to your room.
Removing the ligatures will be painful.
- Do you want some laudanum?
- No thanks, kind lady.
I'll fall asleep, and then you might cut off... my other leg.
I'd welcome some wine, though.
You might welcome it, but you won't get it.
Undo your trouser leg.
Where's your virgin assistant?
Didn't she want to stay to finish the job?
Miss Edwina has no interest in what happens to you.
Young ladies, come get ready to eat.
Johnny?
Johnny?
- Who is it?
- Carol.
I'm sorry about what happened.
- I want you to know that.
- Don't think a thing of it.
I've just been thinking about... all the advantages... a one-legged man has.
He saves on socks.
Doesn't have to worry about trimming as many toenails.
Fewer corns and bunions.
I've even been contemplating... asking her to cut off the other leg.
What happened makes no difference to me.
I know it won't hinder you romantically.
I'm sure a one-legged man... or even a no-legged man... can enjoy himself that way, same as any man.
I'll do anything for you.
Then unlock this door.
I got some things I want to do.
But somebody might see me.
Do it while everyone else is eating.
- But they'd know it was me.
- No, they won't.
They'll just think somebody forgot to lock it.
All right, I'll try.
How long are you gonna keep him here?
As long as Union troops are in the area.
If he's here, he can't give information about us.
But sooner or later... they'll find the school anyway, won't they?
Not if our troops drive them back.
I'm praying for that, and when it happens the corporal will...
[Gunshot]
Sit right where you are, all of you!
Well, hello, Miss Farnsworth.
I've gotten most of my strength back.
With a little wine from your cellar,
I'll get the rest.
According to the new rules around here...
I'm gonna have the run of this place.
One is that I'm going to be with any young lady... that desires my company.
If you have any objections...
I'm gonna locate the Union cavalry... and tell 'em about some of the goodies... especially the bedding-down variety.
Don't get any ideas about closing the door on me.
I'm liable to just blow one of your ears off.
Unless I miss and hit one of your pretty eyes.
You're wrong to blame her.
Your leg was busted bad.
You don't have to be afraid of being sent to prison now.
Why don't you leave this place?
Not till I've had my fill.
You're a damn handsome woman.
Maybe I'll start with you.
[McB]
Go on down to the cellar.
I've been having a run of bad luck lately.
I understand the way to fix that is to have a black woman.
Then white boy... you better like it with a dead black woman...
'cause that's the only way you'll get it from this one.
Almighty God...
I ask that this school and its occupants... escape thy total wrath.
Be quiet and sit down.
Hallie, Janie's on watch.
I want her here.
- Close the door behind you.
- What can we do?
- I'm so scared.
- I know, dear.
He told me he was gonna kill me if I made any noise.
And he forced me to do what he wanted.
We understand, Carol.
He made me do the most terrible things.
Where the hell is everybody?
Edwina, you go sit in my chair.
Hallie, stay by me.
We must give him no provocation.
Well, well.
All the little seminar darlings.
What is the good lady
"seminaring" you in now?
Mister Johnny, please.
Why don't you just leave!
Yes, take your possessions with you.
And my leg!
Can I take that with me?
You girls know why Miss Dabney there... knocked me down the stairs.
That's because I went to Carol's room instead of hers.
And do you know how I got out of my room in the first place?
Because this fine lady,
Miss Farnsworth, unlocked my door... so I could go to her room.
And do you know why Miss Farnsworth... chopped off my leg and left me a cripple?
So I could stay on here, and be at her beck and call.
The picture in this locket.
- Is that your sweetheart?
- That's my brother.
- That wasn't the question.
- You stole that.
Give it back to me, please.
Why would I want to give it back?
It belonged to my mother.
I found it with a stack of letters with a blue ribbon...
- tied around it.
- You read his letters?
Enough.
- You beast!
- That's right!
But I don't run a school for young girls!
These girls might like to know what kind of woman runs this place!
Mr. McB, Randolph hasn't eaten in days!
You could get him to!
You tryin' to wheedle that woman?
Randolph!
God in heaven, child,
I didn't mean to do that.
Stay away from me!
I hate you!
Condemned me, that's what you've done.
To bitterness and drink, and doing mean things.
Why the hell didn't you just castrate me?
- Where are you going?
- To him. He needs help.
Not from you!
I will not let you make a fool of yourself!
What do you want?
I love you.
I love you!
Perhaps when he's sober again, he'll be more reasonable.
Perhaps together we can persuade him to leave.
You said he might send
Yankee soldiers here.
Yes, you're quite right, Janie.
Yes, we can't take that risk.
No one in this house is safe as long as he remains here.
The only question now is how to rid ourselves of him.
Enemy soldiers are always shot.
With what?
He's got the only gun.
Tie him up when he's asleep... and take him into the woods.
Just leave him there to die of thirst and hunger?
I think that would be too cruel, Miss Martha.
If he were tied up, why couldn't we hang him?
Oh, any such action would be too drastic.
None of us would want to be responsible for his death.
Or even be capable of it.
Maybe... if we were to prepare him an excellent supper... and said that we wanted to make it up to him.
Hallie... you could prepare your savory chicken.
And Amy... could pick some mushrooms.
They're his favorite dish... and we could prepare them... especially for him.
Do you think you could do that, Amy?
I know just where to find 'em.
I was surprised at your supper invitation, Miss Farnsworth.
I didn't know whether to accept or not.
I said and did some ugly things today.
I'm sober now.
I've told Edwina, and I want to tell you... and the rest of the girls how much I apologize.
We accept your apology, Corporal.
But I think now it's best if we don't speak about it.
Now, would you care to say grace...
Corporal?
Good bread, good meat... good God, let's eat.
God, we thank you for what we're about to receive... and we hope that the drums that divide us will soon be silent.
Now, everybody eat before Hallie's chicken gets cold.
Pass the biscuits to Corporal McBurney.
Pass the mushrooms, Amy.
Amy picked them especially for you.
Thank you, Amy.
Amy, I feel miserable about what happened today.
Anything I could do... to bring back your turtle,
I sure would.
But you must understand, it was the wine that...
- turned loose the devils in me.
- I do understand.
That's why I picked the mushrooms.
Mmm... and are they good, Amy.
They taste of the woods and the clean air... and mysterious shadows where pretty elves dance together.
What a romantic way to speak of mushrooms.
The first Union troops
I meet up with...
I'm gonna ask them if they'll post a guard around the school.
They do that for friendly Southerners.
What do you mean,
"meet up with"?
I mean, tomorrow morning at dawn I'll be leaving.
[Edwina] I'll see that... he doesn't forget to do that good turn.
I'm leaving with him.
We're going to be married.
That's right.
She asked me and I said yes.
No, I didn't!
Congratulations to you both.
But have you forgotten you're a partner here?
No... and I'll be grateful to you all my life.
But I love him.
I have to go with him.
[Martha] It's only natural... but supposing you do meet the soldiers.
Whether they're
Confederate or Union... he won't be able to protect you.
What will happen to you?
I've lived with the war for a long time.
It doesn't frighten me.
We're spoiling everybody's supper.
And Amy picked these mushrooms especially for me.
Edwina, will you have some?
And pass it on to the other girls.
Lizzie?
No, Edwina!
Don't.
Oh, my God!
[Crash]
Girls, finish your meal.
[Martha] Lizzie, that is not the stitch I showed you.
Watch how Doris does it.
[Doris] See, Lizzie?
[Doris] See, Lizzie?
You run the needle through both sides... then lock the stitch underneath, like this.
That's the way I did it.
No, it's not.
Try it again.
Doesn't look as if he suffered much.
I'm sure he didn't, Carol.
[Martha] I think probably his heart just gave out.
He was in a very weakened condition.
I love you.
[Lizzie] But I thought the mushrooms killed him.
You think I can't tell bad mushrooms from good ones?
And Mr. McB said himself how delicious they were.
Lizzie, Amy... open the gates.
Come all you pretty fair maids
Come walk in the sun
- Do we have classes today, Miss Martha?
- I don't see why not.
And don't let your young man ever carry a gun
Come all you young fellows
Take warning by me
Don't go for a soldier
Don't join no army
For the dove she will leave you
The raven will come
And death will come marching
At the beat of the drum
[Distant Drums]
[Dove Cooing]
Come on, pick up your feet.
- This box is pretty heavy, Lieutenant.
- Gold usually is.
Come on, get a hold of it in there.
- Get in there with it, and stay there.
- Yes, sir.
Tell Colonel McNally the train's ready.
- We're waiting instructions.
- Yes, sir.
Tell Colonel McNally the train is ready.
- Waiting instructions.
- Thanks.
I'm sorry to disturb you, Colonel.
You were told to, Lieutenant.
You'd have been sorrier if you hadn't.
Yes, sir.
- What do you want?
- A message from Plainsburg.
- What does Lieutenant Forsythe want?
- Further instructions, sir.
You tell the Lieutenant to get in that car, and stay there until I knock on the door.
Yes, sir.
- Sergeant, the gold's on the train.
- Did you hear that?
The Colonel says for you to get in that car and stay there until he knocks on the door.
Good luck, Lieutenant.
Let's go.
Hey, Sergeant.
The train's left Plainsburg.
You all hear that?
Keep on listening.
Captain!
Message coming through.
- The train is on its way.
- Better get ready.
- Don't worry, Captain.
- We're waiting.
What time is that train due at River Junction?
About 15 minutes, sir.
She'll take on wood and water.
- Who's in command?
- Captain Barrett, sir.
Well, you give Captain Barrett my compliments.
And tell him if anything goes wrong at River Junction,
I will personally see that he rues the day.
Yes, sir.
I can't see how you can hear a train by listening to the rail.
- Them rails is all put together...
- Shut up!
Keep quiet.
- Here she comes, Sarge.
- All right. Get back.
Don't let nobody see ya.
And don't come out till I tell ya.
It's hard to let that much gold go by.
When it gets as far as the Captain, we'll get it back.
All right, boys. Let's go.
Move it. Come on.
Let's get those ropes across the track.
Bigfoot, tell the Captain the train passed here.
Sure, Sergeant.
- Get 'em to tie them ropes well.
- Tie those ropes hard and fast.
Hank, move faster, or the train will be gone!
Captain! They left River Junction.
James... you got enough grease?
We've got enough so when that train hits, it won't go nowhere.
- You'd better put it on extra heavy.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- You ready?
These hornets are getting mad.
Just listen to 'em.
They're mad all right.
- How does it look, Lieutenant?
- Well, it looks just fine.
- She's a comin', Captain.
- Everybody get out of sight.
And don't come out until you see me.
Beauford, get down from that tree.
- Train's left River Junction, sir.
- Good.
Once it gets here, there's not much to worry about.
- It isn't here yet, Lieutenant.
- No, sir, but...
- So, do you mind if I worry?
- No, sir.
- May I say something, Colonel?
- Go ahead.
Is it because from River Junction to here is the worst part of the trip that you gave the gold detail to Lieutenant Forsythe?
That's one of the reasons.
He's been with you quite a while, hasn't he, sir?
- Since the war began.
- Yes, sir.
That engine's sure pullin' hard up that hill.
We're slowing down, Lieutenant.
Watch her when she hits the grease.
The wheels are slipping and we have no traction.
Hornets!
We've got to get out of here.
- We're all set, Captain.
- Good. Billy Joe, get that wire down.
Blow off her steam.
All right, everybody on.
Cut loose.
Come on, get on.
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Jack, come on!
Get up, Jack!
Willie, you nearly didn't make it.
The wire's dead.
Could be the lines are down.
The wires are dead between here and River Junction!
- Damn! Call in your outposts.
- Yes, sir.
Open the door.
- Captain, them hornets is sure busy.
- Yeah. I see 'em.
For God's sake, Harry, jump!
Let's go! Jump!
Get off the train.
- I can't see.
- Jump.
- Johnson, is that all of them?
- I'll find out, Captain.
Can't see a soul.
Give those hornets some smoke and get them out of there.
I don't want 'em there when I go in.
It's all yours, Captain.
Yes, sir.
We're going faster than we figured.
Can you slow it down?
- Brakes don't do no good, Captain.
- We're gonna hit hard.
You'd better find a good hold.
- Good work, Sergeant.
- Have any trouble?
- Not much.
- Bide's handling the gold.
The horses are here.
You'll be all right, Jim.
- What happened?
- They greased the track.
They jumped us and knocked us out.
When I came to, the train was gone.
- Can you get this thing going?
- No, sir. All the steam is gone.
- So much booty!
- Hand me some.
We got plenty for everybody.
- We got the gold all right, sir.
- Get it loaded quickly.
It's heavy, Sarge.
Let's go. Keep it moving.
Corporal, get that wagon started.
Let's not take all day, men.
All right, move out.
- How is he, Corporal?
- He's got a bad cut on his shoulder.
- I'll be all right.
- What's the matter with your face?
- They threw a hornet's nest in the car.
- That's why we had to jump, sir.
- Where's Lieutenant Forsythe?
- Down the track. He's hurt pretty bad.
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.
Stand at ease. Fall out and give 'em a hand here. Move forward!
Colonel McNally, over here.
Ned?
Sorry, sir. But we couldn't stay in that car with all those hornets.
I know. Can you feel this?
Colonel, those Rebs had to know beforehand about that gold.
- They sure as hell did.
- They sure got the jump on us.
- Can you feel this, Ned?
- No. It just feels numb, sir.
Can you move your head?
No. But it doesn't hurt, sir.
- I'll be all right.
- Your neck's broken.
I'm sorry
I can't wait here with you, but...
I know, sir.
Colonel...
- Catch 'em, will ya?
- I will.
Corporal, get up in that car and take a look-see.
Wyler, get on ahead of us, see which way they took off.
Probably south.
Colonel, the gold's gone.
They got it, sir.
I thought so.
Here, Colonel.
They had a wagon.
You can see the tracks. They split up.
Part of them went that way with the wagon and the rest out there.
The wagon was heavy coming in and heavy when it left.
The load could have come from this pile of stones.
Maybe that's what they wanted us to think.
- You mean the gold's on the wagon?
- Well, I'm goin' after the wagon.
You take half the troop and follow those that went to the east.
Cartel, you and your squad follow me.
And Lieutenant... If you catch 'em,
I want you to bring a couple back.
- And I want them to be able to talk.
- Yes, sir.
Follow me.
Jenkins. Check that trail.
- Colonel.
- What is it?
Here's a button from a Reb uniform.
Could have come this way.
- Could a wagon get up there?
- Not a chance.
You and Miller come with me and the rest of you follow that trail.
If the gold was in the wagon, they're packing it now.
- They came into the water here.
- They went upstream or downstream?
Who can say?
All right. You two go downstream and I'll go upstream.
Hey, Johnny Reb, stay right where you are!
Yank, I'm unarmed.
That's what bothers me.
Turn around anyway.
- Don't drown him.
- I won't.
He hit his head, Captain.
Give us a hand here.
He's heavier than a baby whale!
- It's all quiet out there, Sergeant.
- Let's hope it stays that way, Captain.
You'd better leave that bandage alone, unless you want to start bleeding again.
- How do you feel?
- I hurt.
- You hit your head on a rock.
- I feel like a fool lettin' you take me.
I would, too.
You haven't got a bad leg.
That bandage fooled me.
Bide over there loaned it to me.
It's real blood, too, Colonel.
Made by a Yankee bullet.
- Who knocked me off my horse?
- Tuscarora, here.
I hurt a little, too, Colonel.
You're a big man.
You're the outfit that's been taking our gold shipments.
- That's the fourth lot you've grabbed.
- The South needs money, Colonel.
I know you from someplace, don't I?
- You do.
- What's your name?
Pierre Cordona.
French mother, Mexican father.
From New Orleans.
Four or five years ago in Abilene.
- That's right.
- Something about a horse, wasn't it?
- Big bay horse. You stole it.
- The hell I did. I won it.
- You won a sorrel.
- The sorrel was lame.
When you play poker, you should know what you are playing for.
I remember.
We were both on that big bay.
I was in front and you were behind with a gun in my back.
- Your friends wanted to shoot me.
- I wasn't happy about it.
Colonel, I'd feel better if you'd stay away from those rifles.
Neither one of us got hurt.
Tell me, what am I doin' in this rig?
Well, Colonel, you used me and now I'm going to use you.
This time you'll be in front and get us out of here.
If we run into any Yanks, you'll be between us and them.
- You'll get shot first.
- I don't know where all our units are.
If you don't know, you better guess pretty good.
I would start doing a little thinking before we leave.
- When are we leaving?
- As soon as it's dark.
- Do you have to tie my hands?
- Captain's orders.
Colonel, I'll be riding right behind you.
I can throw this knife pretty good.
- And it makes no noise.
- I hear you.
Douse that light.
Them in the back, too.
Get ready to move out.
Captain!
- What is it, Corporal?
- Which direction is he taking us?
South. I can't see the stars, but we should be headin' south.
You're wrong. Which side of a tree does moss grow on?
- The north side.
- The moss is on this side.
Right now we're goin' north.
Sure. We're goin' north.
Half of Sheridan's army is south of here.
The only way we can go is around 'em.
I don't know if I can get you through, but it's your idea, Captain, and you're stuck with it.
You better not be trying something,
Colonel. You might be sorry for it.
Lead on.
Hold it, Colonel.
We're getting near water and I smell smoke.
- Take a look, Sergeant.
- Better keep an eye on the Yank.
- What do you think, Colonel?
- I can't keep track of every outfit.
Might be some of your Johnny Rebs.
- They're Yanks. A cavalry outfit.
- That'll be the 10th Ohio.
- They were 20 miles away yesterday.
- You're on track of where you are.
- I try to, Sergeant.
- Can we go by them?
- Better ask the Yank here.
- Best to go right by them, east.
Pass the word.
We're near a Yankee camp.
Keep your horses quiet.
Use your hands if you have to.
- How do I do that with mine tied?
- Cut him loose.
- You be mighty careful, Colonel.
- I will.
Go ahead. Slow.
See anything, Colonel?
Rebs on your flank. Look alive!
Get over here.
Every man for himself.
Separate and ride south.
We'll meet back by the bridge.
Don't lose that gold.
O'Brien, you and...
Don't get nervous, Sergeant.
Just drop that pistol.
Keep movin'.
Your Captain's over by that log.
- What happened to him, Colonel?
- He hit his head.
He's all right.
Wake him up.
- What's in that canteen, Sergeant?
- Corn liquor.
I could use a little of that myself.
Better be quiet.
Your Captain's in the wrong uniform, remember?
Well, Captain, how do you feel?
Back in the cave you said you felt like a fool. Now I do.
I thought you gave in a little too easy.
When we was goin' north to get away, we was just goin' into trouble.
- You wanted that gold bad.
- Not as bad as I wanted you two.
Somebody in my outfit had to be giving you information.
- I want him.
- And you want us to tell you.
Tell me and I'll cut you loose and turn my back...
The two of you will have a good chance of getting away.
Otherwise... you're a prisoner in the wrong uniform.
- You know what that can get you!
- Yeah, I know.
And our boys lose all chance of gettin' more gold.
The war isn't over yet, Colonel.
All right. Over here!
- Captain. Hold up!
- Over here!
Captain! Just got this.
Damn! All this for nothing!
Give him a blanket, corporal.
Next man. You got boots and shoes?
- Chills and fever?
- No, sir.
- Any cramps?
- No.
You will, when you have that pork. Drink this.
- Next man.
- Name, rank, unit.
Bide, lance corporal.
Tupelo Fusiliers.
It was a small outfit, getting smaller.
Last I heard, I was all of it.
Length of internment, eight months.
Give that to the paymaster. Next.
- You were right.
- I thought he'd be here.
Cordona, Pierre. Captain.
1 st Louisiana Cavalry.
You'll get two dollars, Captain.
Sign here.
- You're entitled to your sword, Captain.
- Could I have a pistol?
- No firearms.
- Never mind about the sword.
Phillips, Tuscarora. Sergeant.
1 st Louisiana Cavalry.
- Pierre and Tuscarora.
- You've got a good memory.
Glad you weathered the storm.
It's the simple life - no wine, no women, no song.
- And no whisky.
- I can remedy that.
You don't mind drinking with a Blue Belly?
- I'd drink with the devil himself.
- I feel just like he does.
We're headed in the right direction.
- Hi, Colonel.
- Hello, whisky for three.
None of that cow purge!
Give us some whisky.
But, Colonel, this is planter's stock.
Jamaican rum.
- I paid dear for this.
- And you charge dear for it.
Give us that stuff on the bottom shelf.
Give me the bottle.
Colonel,
I know why you want to see us.
You haven't found the fella who told us about your gold shipments.
Who sold you the information about our gold shipments.
No, I haven't. But I will.
You make it sound personal, Colonel.
A boy that I watched grow up was in that car that you threw the hornets into.
Was he hurt bad?
- We buried him the next day.
- I'm sorry.
We killed your friend, but you don't hold that against us.
What you did was an act of war.
But selling information, that's treason.
Rotten treachery for money.
- I want the name of that man.
- There were two.
I don't know their names.
We gave them money.
- They gave us the information.
- Can you describe them?
One was a big man.
Almost as big as you.
The other one... You were closer.
The other fella, even in the dark he stood out.
He was like an albino.
White hair, white skin. Smaller man.
- That's all.
- That's more than I had.
You fellas can do me a favour.
If you run into either of them, let me know.
You can be sure of that.
- Another drink?
- Let us buy you a drink.
What did you get when you signed out?
Two dollars.
- Where are you heading?
- I'll just look around.
I'm going back to Texas.
The man who brought me up has a ranch in Rio Lobo.
Two dollars won't get you very far.
Since you've been locked up, our pay's been coming through regularly.
That'll get you to Texas.
You can owe me.
I never thought
I'd want to kiss a Yank.
If we run into one of those fellas you're after, where can we reach you?
Blackthorne, Texas.
That's near your Rio Lobo country.
The Sheriff there can get in touch with me.
I see the Sheriff of Blackthorne County has earned some bounty money.
One of these little hides can buy a lot of drinks.
- Good to see you.
- Thanks.
I was wonderin' when you'd show up.
I got your message that Pierre Cordona wanted to see me.
Yeah. He got in last night.
He's at the hotel.
Come on in. I'll give you a drink.
What's it all about, Cord?
Can you tell me why you're here?
Didn't Cordona grab a coupla army payrolls from the Yanks?
That's right.
I heard that you captured him and put him in a prison camp.
You heard right.
Cord, you're not fixing on causing any trouble? I wouldn't like that.
Don't worry, Pat.
Besides, you're too good for that young fella.
There's no hard feelings between us.
The war's over.
Oh, that's good.
Then why do you want to see him?
The only reason Cordona could get away with those payrolls, was because some people on our side were selling him information.
I'm after them.
Are you working for the army, or is this personal?
Both.
Sheriff, I'd say you were going to have company.
- Which of you is the Sheriff?
- I'm Pat Cronin. If there's anything...
I want to report a murder. And I want the man who did it arrested.
- Where'd this happen?
- In Rio Lobo.
I'm sorry, that's out of my jurisdiction.
- You're not going to do anything?
- Excuse me. You said Rio Lobo...
Are you connected with the Sheriff's office?
- No, I...
- Will you please stay out of this?
Sheriff, does that mean you're not going to do anything?
It means I can't do anything.
I have no authority there.
A man was killed...
Unless a US Marshal or the Sheriff of Rio Lobo asks me...
You know the Sheriff of Rio Lobo and you know he won't ask you.
I know.
The man who committed the murder was one of his deputies.
I'm sorry, miss.
Well, so am I. I just thought...
So am I!
- Who is the Sheriff of Rio Lobo?
- Tom Hendricks.
- Blue Tom?
- That's right. Ever run into him?
I chased him enough, but I never got lucky.
- How about that drink?
- I'm out.
As usual. I'll buy you one.
Town's growing up, Pat.
- Morning, Hank.
- Morning. Can I help you?
I'd like you to meet my friend
Cord McNally.
- Glad to meet you.
- Thank you.
- I'm looking for a Pierre Cordona.
- Room 19.
- Key's gone.
- He's up there all right.
Just a minute.
He left a message about something.
He'll shoot anybody who wakes him up unless the building is on fire.
He gave me two dollars to see that nobody started a fire.
Two dollars will buy a lot of sleep around here.
- I guess we can wait.
- How about that drink?
And remember, you're buying.
- Hello, Jane.
- Hello, Sheriff.
Sit down. Give us a bottle, Jim.
Little Miss Busybody.
She'll either be in the jail or the hotel.
Chuck, take a look in the jail.
- Nobody in the jail, Whitey.
- All right.
George, you go around the back.
Come in that way.
You two come with me.
Pat.
Well, young lady.
You gave us quite a chase.
Sheriff, this is the man that I wanted you to arrest. He's the murderer.
That may give the Sheriff the wrong idea about me.
It was self-defence.
He tried to knife me.
That's a lie!
Hold on, I can handle this.
What exactly is your business here?
Name's Carter. Whitey Carter.
I'm a deputy from Rio Lobo.
As to my business,
I came lookin' for her. She's wanted.
What for?
She and the old man she lived with ran one of them medicine shows.
You know, snake oil, crooked shell games, pick a few pockets...
That's another lie. I didn't do anything.
Sheriff in Rio Lobo just wants to talk to her, so I'll take her along with us.
Just a minute. I'm the Sheriff of Blackthorne. I want to see a warrant.
- A warrant?
- For the young lady's arrest.
I never thought about that.
Without a warrant, you're not taking anybody.
I got a warrant right here, Sheriff.
Satisfied, Sheriff?
Now, drop your gun and go sit down.
All right, everyone stand still.
No one gets hurt.
Come on.
Look out!
- Did they hit you, Pat?
- No, I did it myself when I hit the floor.
You're getting too old.
Hello, Captain.
I'm glad you joined us when you did.
I heard the racket and knew it was you.
How did it start?
This young lady here shot that white-haired man.
- She really didn't want to go with him!
- Can you blame her?
This was one of the fellas you were hunting.
- Well, I never! Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
Is he dead?
- Unfortunately, yes.
- Did I kill him?
Not entirely, but you sure helped.
Well, I couldn't let him take me.
I'd rather be dead.
- You damned near got us all killed.
- I'm sorry...
Are you gonna faint?
- What'll I do with her?
- Bring her up to my room.
- Where is it?
- Up on the left. The door is open.
There's somebody in there.
Oh, I forgot.
Come on, Mable. Get out.
Come on. Move on.
- Why can't I sleep?
- I'll explain later. Come on.
Is that what I'm leaving for?
I thought you were a gentleman.
- You've been busy.
- Just keeping out of trouble.
Hank, go get the undertaker.
Never mind. Here he comes.
I heard some shooting, Sheriff.
Do you need me?
I got a lot of work for you. One there.
Two over here and one in the corner.
I'll get right at it.
What did you find out?
I talked to the stage driver that brought the girl from Rio Lobo.
He said he picked her up a couple of miles out of town.
She was tellin' the truth all right.
He was after her and he shot the old man with the medicine wagon.
What did Tuscarora say in that letter?
Only that he saw one of the men you were after. A man with white hair.
- That'll be Whitey from downstairs.
- Whitey worked for a rich Yankee.
Tuscarora hasn't seen this Yankee.
But you didn't come all the way to Blackthorne to tell me that.
Tuscarora's in trouble. They're trying to take his old man's land.
- And you thought I'd join in?
- Two guns are better than one.
Maybe we're after the same thing.
Maybe I can help you.
Well, I reckon I'm in. I'll go as far as Rio Lobo and we'll find out.
- What did you just say?
- Well, how do you feel?
I don't know. Aren't you the man that came downstairs...
...and helped us when we needed it.
Pierre Cordona, Miss...
What is your name?
It's Shasta - Shasta Delaney.
You don't have any pants on, Mr Cordona.
- I didn't have time after the shooting.
- You have time now.
- Why don't you put them on?
- Cos you're lying on them.
- You don't have many clothes on too.
- Who took my clothes off?
- I did.
- Why?
- We flipped a coin and I won.
- I've never heard anything...
Haven't you heard of loosening a person's clothes when they faint?
Oh, yes.
I guess I'm acting like an idiot, aren't I?
- I'd say almost.
- Yeah, I'd say so, too.
You suppose I could have a drink?
- You're not gonna faint again, are you?
- No, Mr McNally.
Do you only take a drink when you're about to faint?
I'd hardly say that, miss.
You all right?
Oh, didn't I hear you say something about going to Rio Lobo?
- You did.
- Good. I'm going with you.
- You? Oh, no you're not.
- Don't be silly.
How much do you know about
Rio Lobo? You've never been there.
You don't know where to go, who to talk to or who's an enemy.
- I can help.
- Why do you want to go?
I want to get my wagon.
Old Charlie wanted me to have it.
Every time I think about him I...
- Anyway, it's all I own.
- You can't ride in that outfit.
If you get me a horse
I'll be ready in ten minutes.
When you get the troops paraded, let me know. I'll be in the bar.
There she is.
I'll take that.
- How far is it to Rio Lobo?
- 70 or 80 miles.
- Took three days on the stage.
- It'll take us longer.
We forgot something.
Can she ride? Can you?
- Which side do you get on?
- Left side. I knew it.
- You're a good teacher, Frenchy!
- Yeah.
This looks a good place to bed down.
It's cold, but it'll get colder.
I'll see what I can find to make a fire.
Shasta, you don't have a bottle of that snake oil, do you?
- I just happen to have some.
- Good.
Hey, what are you so happy about,
Colonel?
Well, I've had about the right number of drinks, and I am warm, and I'm relaxed.
Well, if you gentle people...
...can manage without me,
I shall go to sleep. Good night.
I'm freezing.
This will help.
Don't do that. I don't like it.
- I'm sorry. I was going to...
- I'm tired of being pawed.
What happened?
What made you say that?
- Why go into it?
- Because I'd like to know.
All right.
I was married.
It wasn't a good marriage.
He couldn't drink, but he did anyway.
And when he did, he wasn't good.
When he drank, he'd gamble.
And when he lost, he thought he'd been cheated.
I don't know if he was or not.
But the other guy was faster and a good shot.
So I had to get a job.
Do you know what it's like to work in a saloon?
- No.
- They never leave you alone.
Never.
Then good old Charlie Simms came along.
The only man who was ever nice to me.
And they killed him.
- Do you have any more questions?
- Yeah. What are you gonna do now?
- I'm going to bed.
- I mean after this is all over?
I going to get Charlie's wagon and then I'm going to... I don't know.
You can't run a medicine show by yourself.
I'm pretty good at getting people to buy that Apache Herb Tonic.
Something will turn up.
It always does.
You know... I like you.
- Why?
- Cos you don't cry.
Oh, but I do. You saw me.
You cried for your friend, not for yourself.
There's a lot of difference.
Don't be nice to me, please.
Wait.
- I didn't figure...
- Didn't you want me to do that?
Sure I did. But I'm generally the one who starts it.
That's why I started it.
Cos now I know when it'll stop.
Well, I would...
Oh, good night.
Pierre, see these poles above me?
- Mm-hm.
- I can't figure out what they're for.
They're all burnt.
I'd say they were used by the Indians to bury their dead.
They put the bodies on the poles and burned them.
- Probably, you're sleeping on a skull...
- What?
Hey! Hey!
How about waking up?
- How did she get here?
- Ask her.
Hey, you!
- How'd you get here.
- When you were sleeping. It was cold.
Why me? Why didn't you pick on him?
He's young. I thought...
Well, you're older.
- You're comfortable.
- Comfortable?
I've been called a lot of things, but "comfortable"!
I'll say this. You're a lot better than a hot brick to keep a man warm.
It's nice to be appreciated.
- Is that coffee I smell?
- It is. Get up and have some.
Rise and shine.
Come on.
- This is Rio Lobo. Take a look.
- Looks quiet enough.
It's too late to start anything now.
Where does Tuscarora's girlfriend live?
You said we could hole up there.
Yes, she's on the edge of town.
There's a corral nearby for the horses.
Can we get there without being seen?
Yes, if you can get across the street.
- Take a look, Frenchy.
- Right.
It's me, Shasta. Hurry, Maria.
Oh, Shasta.
Listen, these are friends of Tuscarora's.
They're here to help Mr Phillips.
This is Captain Cordona.
And this is Colonel McNally.
- We need somewhere to stay tonight.
- But the horses...?
- It's not good to have them here.
- Where's a good place?
Over there's an empty house. See?
You will find a corral on your right.
- All right. I'll take them.
- Be careful. They're watching.
- Why did you come back here?
- Maria, it's a long story.
But first, tell me what have Ketcham and the Sheriff been doing?
They've been after Phillips to sell his ranch.
- Has he sold it?
- I don't know.
I haven't seen Tuscarora since you went away.
Everybody is afraid here.
The Sheriff's men are watching everywhere.
- They're watching this house?
- Everywhere.
It's not safe for you to stay here.
We have to stay here tonight.
We haven't eaten.
I'm sorry, I didn't think.
I'll just prepare something for you.
I'm sorry. Someone's chasing me.
I've no other place to go.
- You don't have to go.
- What?
You can stay here.
- Could you put that light out?
- As you wish.
Thanks. Don't stand in the middle of the room.
- Can you see anyone?
- I don't see a soul.
- Would you like me to look?
- I'm looking.
- Yes, but I could go outside.
- You'd better put some clothes on first.
- As you wish.
- No, I didn't mean that.
- I don't think you should go out there.
- Well... we could stay here.
I have plenty of tortillas and beans and chilli and even some wine.
- Sounds good. I wish I could stay.
- Why not?
Because I think they're gone now.
I must get back to my friends.
- I'm sorry.
- I don't know how to thank you.
- You don't have to.
- My name is Pierre. What's yours?
- Thank you, Amelita.
- Wait a minute.
It's all right.
That smells good.
- Come in.
- Where have you been?
I put the horses away and I was hiding.
- Hiding? From whom?
- From the people that watch the town.
- I told you. Where were you?
- In a house of a girl.
A girl? Pretty fast worker.
Where did you meet her?
I crashed the door and there she was.
She's pretty. Dark hair.
- And I think her name's Amelita.
- I know her. She's a friend of mine.
- Well, she helped me.
- I hope you had fun.
Stop it.
What are we gonna do now?
We'll stay here tonight.
In the morning I'll go into town to see what I can find out.
Why don't we go into Phillip's ranch...
If they're watching this town, they're certainly watching the ranch.
- The Sheriff knows you, doesn't he?
- He does.
He'll want to know what you're doing here.
He wants to know all about any stranger.
Wrap up your wrist and say you hurt yourself and you're looking for a doctor.
The dentist's a friend of Tuscarora and Mr Phillips. He can tell you much.
I feel a toothache coming on.
I hope you have plenty of wine, Maria.
Thanks. See they get some water.
- I'll be back in a while.
- Be careful.
- It's been a long time, Maria.
- All right, boys, come on.
Tuscarora. Come here.
You wanna see me?
You just brought some horses into town. Are they yours?
- They're ours.
- I think some were stolen.
That's a lie.
No. Leave him alone!
Stop it!
Stop this wicked thing!
That's enough.
What's going on?
We're teaching him some manners.
He's been stealing horses.
We gotta save enough of him to hang.
Take him over to the jail.
Come on. On your feet.
- Bring the girl, too.
- Why?
Are you all right, lady?
You'd better go on home.
Go on!
You're kinda new around here, aren't you?
- Got in this morning.
- Figure on staying long?
- Bum tooth.
- Doc, got a customer for you.
Oh, and, mister...
After you get that tooth fixed, just amble on out of town.
Sounds like good advice.
- Doctor...
- Come on in, sir.
Keep an eye on that big fella.
See if he really has a bad tooth.
- So you've got a bad tooth?
- No, I haven't.
- Get in the chair.
- I told you, my tooth's all right.
- Can't we just talk?
- See that fella over there?
He's checking out your story on your tooth.
- Open real wide.
- I can't talk with my mouth open.
I'll ask the questions, you just nod or shake your head.
Now, that girl, Maria, the one that got knocked around... she send you?
- Yeah.
- I thought so, the way you bolted here.
That hurts.
Most of my patients yell a lot.
Take a look out there.
He's gone.
Is that my tooth?
No. Yours are fine.
Tell me what's going on around here.
The man running things is Ketcham.
He came here right after the war.
Hendricks killed our old Sheriff and
Ketcham made him the new Sheriff.
- Look out there.
- Wish I could hear what they're saying.
Don't have to... blackmail.
If they do things the way they've been doing,
Hendricks will send his bullyboys out to Old Man Phillips' ranch.
They'll run off all his stock, so he's on foot.
Then they'll tell him the way to keep his boy from being hanged is to sign over his ranch to them for a quarter of what it's worth.
I know that old man.
He's stubborn as hell.
But he dearly loves that boy.
So they'll keep him there till he cracks and signs over his land.
Ketcham's been pickin' up a lot of land.
- All of it that's any good, Mr...?
- Doesn't matter.
Well, Mr Doesn't Matter,
I hope you can do something.
- You got plenty of help?
- Well, no. I haven't.
God be with you.
I still wish you luck.
We ought to give one more good yell.
They usually yell a lot when I give 'em a shot of this.
That's the real stuff.
If you were a good enough actor,
I wouldn't have used it.
That'll be a dollar six bits.
- Would four bits be just as good?
- Just as good.
- Thank you, Mr Doesn't Matter.
- McNally. I'll be seeing you.
You must hide. Maria says the Sheriff is sending some men here.
- Where can we hide in here?
- Under the bed. Hurry.
Wait a minute.
First, pour some water over my head.
- All of it?
- Yes, go ahead.
- Who is it?
- Open up.
- Just a minute.
- Hurry it up.
Just a minute.
- Anybody else in here?
- Well, you're here.
- I can't see. Who are you?
- Sheriff's office.
Nobody in here.
They're gone now.
- What are you laughing at?
- You wouldn't believe what he said.
- Those things are private.
- Do you really get away with that?
- Do you know what he said?
- What did he say?
"One more kiss before we die."
Can you imagine?
- That's stupid.
- It is not.
- Who is it?
- Me.
- What did you find out?
- Plenty.
They slapped Maria around this morning, put Tuscarora in jail for stealing his own horses, and they've gone to Old Man
Phillips' ranch to force him to give in.
- Are we gonna let 'em?
- Not if we can help it.
I'm sorry I couldn't get here before.
- There were men.
- We had visitors.
- I was asking the way to Phillips' ranch.
- I'll take you.
- Not a chance!
- She can't stay here.
You know that, don't you?
I'll take the wagon.
- Why?
- It's all I've got left.
I might not get a chance to come back for it.
You have a lot of faith in us!
You're good, but you're taking on a lot.
- Can you get out without being seen?
- With luck. Help me, Amelita.
I'll meet you east of town, half a mile from the little church.
I can show you.
Is there anything else I can do?
Pray a little.
We'll be back if things work out right.
It's very much for just two men.
I hope there'll be three when we see Mr Phillips.
- Will you show us the way?
- Yes. Follow me.
There are two of them by the gate.
I don't see the third one...
Wait a minute. See that shack behind the house?
- That looks like cigarette smoke.
- You've got good eyes.
I see 'em.
- Think you can handle him?
- Sure. I can get in behind him.
All right.
How about you?
We can leave Shasta at the wagon and when we get through...
How are you gonna get close enough to them?
This comfortable old man figured he'd shoot 'em.
How will you get into the house?
Phillips will blow your head before he knows what side you're on.
- Did you...?
- Don't be sarcastic.
- Do you have any suggestions?
- Yes, I do.
I'll drive the wagon in.
You'll be in back.
And get yourself killed?
They killed Charlie Simms...
I want them to pay for it.
- I'm against it.
- This is your first step, isn't it?
If you fall down, you won't get another chance.
- I will not permit it.
- He's in love with me.
- I didn't say that.
- You said you thought you were.
Are we gonna rescue an old man or stand here and argue?
Give me two minutes before you start and I still don't like it.
This thing between you two - kinda sudden, isn't it?
It's not me, it's him.
Are all Mexicans as sudden as he is?
One little kiss and the balloon goes up.
Let's get in the wagon.
He's had his two minutes.
Two minutes more and we'll know if your idea was any good.
When the shooting starts, don't forget to duck.
Yes, Colonel.
Let's go.
Got a visitor.
What in tarnation is that thing?
Hold it right there, miss.
- Where are you going?
- My horses need water.
- I thought I could get some here.
- It ain't safe to go that way...
Ain't that the girl
Whitey Carter went lookin' for?
- You the girl?
- Yeah, I'm the girl.
- You got any more snake oil?
- Yeah, there's plenty in the wagon.
Think I'll get some.
Where have you been?
They've been lookin' all over for you.
I don't know...
Oh, I guess I can tell you.
I don't like Whitey.
I didn't want him to find me.
Everybody's got different tastes.
You can't...
- What was that?
- Your friend getting some snake oil.
What's a girl to do when a man keeps following her around?
I'm tired. I haven't slept.
Except for the other night, in a place where an Indian was buried.
- It was awful!
- Where was the Indian buried?
I can't remember.
It was just before somebody hit me.
- They hit you?
- I didn't see him, but he hit me.
- Where?
- There.
You took long enough.
I was running out of things to say.
That I can't believe.
- Hurry up.
- Just a minute.
What's goin' on out there?
Who's out there?
Speak up or I'll shoot.
Hold on a bit.
We're trying to help ya!
- Hold your fire, you fool.
- Don't come no closer!
- I'll go. He won't shoot a woman.
- Don't count on it.
Mr Phillips, let me in.
You just stay where you are out there.
What's goin' on?
Look out.
Stay away from that window.
- Where's Shasta?
- Inside.
- Who's out there?
- It's me.
- Who's me?
- Pierre Cordona.
- You Tuscarora's captain?
- Used to be.
Don't try nothing.
You, big fella, get down off that contraption.
Now get your hands up high and walk up here nice and easy.
You too, Cordona.
And keep 'em high.
Just keep them up there.
Keep your hands up and say something. Go ahead.
- What'll I say?
- I wanna hear you talk.
- If you quit prodding me...
- I knew it!
I can tell by your talking, you're a Yank.
- Didn't you tell him?
- He's a difficult man to convince.
You would be too, if you had a flock of no goods hanging on you.
You said you was my boy's captain.
How do I know that?
Did he write to you about the first battle we were in?
- Was he shot in the arm?
- I guess you're who you say you are.
What's this damn big Yank doin' here?
This damn big Yank's after another damn big Yank and helping you in the process.
- What's your name?
- Cord McNally.
Didn't Tuscarora tell you about me?
He sure did.
And I ain't gonna repeat what he said.
Tell me about her.
I'd have shot her, but she's got the best lookin' legs I ever seen.
- I didn't have the view you did.
- What's she doin' here?
Whitey Carter murdered one of her friends.
Old Charlie Simms.
I heard about that.
- Now I know who she is.
- Whitey's dead.
Best news I heard all year.
- Who killed him?
- She did.
Well, I'll be a sucking mule!
Legs like that and can shoot too.
I'm obliged to you for getting me out of the fix I was in.
- This calls for a drink.
- I could sure use one.
They got my boy.
What do you plan on doing?
Ride into town and bust open the jail?
That's not for the young.
What's it brewed with?
Are you just gonna bust open the jail?
The answer is no, unless you want your boy killed.
- Think I'm a fool?
- That's not the question.
We need something to bargain with.
- Like what?
- Like Ketcham.
Ketcham?
Are you serious or crazy?
A little of both, but it's the only way to get your boy back.
- How do you get Ketcham?
- You know his ranch pretty well.
- I was there before he had it.
- How far is it?
Two... three hours.
- You comin' with us?
- Reckon I'm crazy too.
Is there a safe place to leave this young lady while we're gone?
Hank Pryor's place is on the way.
I reckon we can get there before dark, if we leave right away.
- I'm going with you. I can help.
- You're not going.
You've been trying to run this show since we met.
Listen to me and keep still.
You are not going!
- You tell her, Frenchy.
- Yeah.
I'd give every horse I own to get a chance at that fella.
Mr Pryor, if we don't come back, you said...
I'm not gonna disappoint you.
I told you I'd get the girl to Blackthorne.
Thank you.
- Come on, Shasta.
- No.
What the...? Frenchy!
Are you comin' with us, or you got something better to do?
That's a silly question, Colonel.
You'd like to be doin' that yourself, wouldn't you?
No, Mr Phillips, not a chance.
I'm just comfortable.
You keep calling me Frenchy.
I'm half-Mexican, you know?
Yeah. Which half was kneeling and which half was kissing her hand?
- Where's Ketcham apt to be?
- The big house.
- What does he look like?
- Big man. Black hair. Moustache.
Could be anybody.
Could be the man that was with Whitey when we paid the money.
- How many men has he got?
- 15 or 20 hands in the bunkhouse.
There's one over there, another farther to the right.
And these men guarding the place, which you boys call sentries.
- Ketcham doesn't take many chances.
- I can see three... no, four.
There's one over by the gate.
We'll have to get them first, get into that house, grab Ketcham, and use him to hold the rest off.
- We'd better not kill him, then?
- No, we'd better not kill him.
- Well, Frenchy?
- I'll take the one in front of the house.
I'll take the one on the left and the one in front of the bunkhouse.
Leave one for me.
Could you sneak up on that fella at the gate?
I can sneak up on a coyote if I have a mind to.
You better give me a little start.
No sense in letting this go to waste.
Remind me to ask Tuscarora a question.
About what?
He said you were a saintly old man who didn't hold with all the vices.
I don't hold with them at all.
That don't stop me from taking a saintly pleasure when I get a chance.
- Why don't you blow a bugle?
- Ready? If you ain't, I'll go by myself.
- Where's the old man?
- There.
Did you get the fella at the gate?
He's at another gate looking for Saint Peter.
That big man at the desk, he's the one I gave the money to.
Sergeant lke Gorman.
I've waited a long time for this.
Sergeant Major Gorman, how does it feel?
Remember Lieutenant Forsythe?
Well, here's one for him.
- Get up!
- Only for a while.
McNally, give him one for Tuscarora.
Right, let's talk to your people.
Tell 'em they move a finger and I blow your head off. Yell out.
Do you hear me? This is Ketcham.
Don't move. Don't do anything.
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah, we hear you.
Tell 'em to get our horses.
And one for you.
Bring their horses and one for me.
All right.
Find out where he hides them deeds and all the stuff he's been stealin'.
You don't think
I'd keep them here, do you?
Where do you keep 'em?
Where are they?
- At the bank.
- Where?
- In the bank.
- Where?
They're here.
Behind that cabinet. In a safe.
Take a look.
It's locked.
Here they are, McNally.
All the stuff we were lookin' for.
Look out!
Fire! Help me, please!
- Phillips, help me, please.
- Let him burn.
Don't let him burn till he signs these papers.
- Are you ready to sign?
- I'll sign anything.
All right, Frenchy.
Ketcham, take a look at this.
The triggers are wired back.
See what happens if my thumb slips off.
And my thumbs ain't as strong as they used to be.
We got your horses.
What shall we do with them?
Bring 'em up to the house.
Come on, let's go.
One man hold the horses.
The rest of you clear out.
We're coming outside.
Do what he says.
Don't try anything.
You take the sorrel. That one's mine.
Can you cover him while I get up?
All that fighting in there wore me out.
All right, Ketcham, move out.
Let's hold it up here.
I can't keep riding like this.
Would you rather walk?
- Anybody following us?
- Didn't see anyone.
Let's talk a bit. You want your boy out of jail, don't you, Mr Phillips?
Damn right I do.
- How do we get him out?
- We use Ketcham.
And how long do you think before Hendricks will have us too?
You and your military mind. You gotta know the answer to everything.
- What'll we do?
- All right.
Us civilians ain't the fools you Yanks think.
- There's a fort at Longhorn Springs.
- That's right.
- We'll take him there.
- What'll Hendricks be doing?
He'd rather see Ketcham dead than the army get him.
- You got something in mind?
- Yeah.
We don't take Tuscarora out of jail, we join him there and fort up. You...
I go into Longhorn Springs and bring in the cavalry.
- That's smart for a captain, Frenchy.
- Thank you, sir.
You ought to be back by late tomorrow afternoon.
If we run into trouble, we can hold out till then.
Stay on this trail till you hit the stage road, then take the west fork.
Good luck, Colonel. Sir.
Don't forget my thumb is gettin' tired.
Don't go over rocks. My horse might stumble and we'd have an accident.
Let's go.
- What are you doin' here?
- We went to Phillips' ranch.
Barter's dead,
Minton had a broken shoulder, and Chester had been cold cocked pretty bad.
He said a girl drove in that medicine show wagon.
He was lookin' it over and that's all he could remember.
It coulda been three of 'em. The wagon was gone and so was Phillips.
- Anybody see where the wagon went?
- Couldn't find any tracks. Too dark.
Spence, you take five men and guard the north road.
Morton, you take a few more.
Leave some on the south road close in.
The rest of you go to the west fork.
Stop everybody going out and in.
Shoot anybody that tries to get by.
Now move.
- What are we stopping here for?
- Tuscarora's girlfriend.
Maybe I can find out how things stand.
Can you handle Ketcham?
If you hear a loud noise, it'll be Mr Ketcham dying.
You got him! I'm glad.
In case you don't know, that's Spanish for "pig", Ketcham.
Much has happened tonight.
The men came from the Phillips ranch and told what you had done and the Sheriff was very angry.
Would you like to see what he does when he's angry?
Amelita, show him.
Amelita?
Take a look.
Go on, take a good look.
The Sheriff did it.
- Why?
- To make me talk. To punish me.
He did it and then he laughed.
- Someday I'm gonna kill him.
- You'll have to beat me to it.
I'm gonna kill him someday.
Be careful. The Sheriff has many men outside hunting for you.
And others waiting for you in the jail.
We've got the edge on him.
We got their boss.
- I will pray for you.
- Good night.
They don't know we got Ketcham yet, but they know we've been to your place and got you, so they'll probably be waiting for us.
- You still wanna try?
- With or without you, Colonel.
That's good enough for me.
Move.
We're gettin' near the jail, Mr Ketcham.
My rheumatism is bad, so don't put a strain on my finger.
You in the jail!
Tell Hendricks to step out.
Blue Tom, we've got your friend Ketcham here.
And there's a sawn-off shotgun with the triggers tied back right behind him.
He wants to tell you something.
Sergeant Major, you louse this up and you won't live to know it. Talk.
Hold your fire, Tom.
Do anything he says. Don't try anything.
- You hear him?
- I heard.
Get all your men out of the jail.
You heard him. Come on out.
Now, everybody drop their guns.
- What d'ya say, Mr Ketcham?
- Do it. For God's sake, do it.
All right, drop 'em.
Everybody ease over and keep going till you're in front of that hotel.
Hendricks, you hold it.
There's still somebody in that jail,
Ketcham.
Tom, don't try it.
Get whoever's in there out.
All right, Barney, come on out.
Drop your gun and get over with the rest of 'em.
You wanna step down, Mr Phillips?
Hope this thing don't go off while I'm climbing down.
Step off, Sergeant Major.
Let's go to jail.
Don't worry, Mr Ketcham, we'll get you outta there.
That's a good idea, Sheriff.
Why don't you try it? Please try it!
No, Tom, forget it. He wants you to try something. He's crazy.
He's right. Got another barrel left.
Get in there.
We'll be here a day, maybe two.
Then the US Cavalry will be here.
- I should have taken you this morning.
- You should have tried.
I couldn't say hello this morning, but I'm glad to see you.
- How do you feel?
- Fine. Except for some sore ribs.
I'll stay back here with Ketcham in case his friends try something.
Don't you worry none, Ketcham.
You're gonna be the first to die.
- Where's Captain Cordona?
- He's gone for help.
How long are we gonna be here?
Till he comes back with the cavalry.
Douse that light.
Mr Phillips, is that the only tune you know?
I don't know this one, that's why I keep practising it.
Colonel, you have any trouble gettin' back into town?
They had men out, but we had Ketcham.
You suppose they have men watching the roads too?
Hendricks is not stupid.
What if they catch the Captain before he gets help?
Then we're in more trouble than we've been in since the start.
Mr Phillips, is there any way of getting you to stop that?
Yeah, I'd stop for a drink.
Well, if there's one, I'll get it for you.
Where are you going?
In the jail.
This is Doc Jones, the dentist.
Can I come in?
Let him in.
You're taking a chance coming here.
I don't think so.
They're not watching the place.
Don't bet on it.
I brought some food and beer.
- Better see Ketcham gets a bite.
- He don't get no beer, does he?
Neither do you, unless you promise not to play that harp.
I'll stop.
- Who's there?
- Shasta.
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't stand waiting, not knowing.
I took one of Mr Pryor's horses.
Nobody saw me.
Hey, you in the jail.
- What d'ya want?
- I got a message.
I don't wanna get shot delivering it.
Here it is.
See what it is.
- They got Frenchy.
- Is he all right?
Evidently.
They wanna trade him for Ketcham.
- So there'll be no soldiers.
- Where do they want the trade off?
There's a barn by a creek at the other end of town.
I know where that is.
They'll be at the barn with Frenchy an hour after sun up.
- We're to bring Ketcham.
- Is that all it says?
- That's all.
- What will they do after the trade?
There's more of them than us.
What do you think they'll do?
- What's it gonna be, Colonel?
- Looks like we have no choice.
You that delivered the message, you out there?
I'm here.
Tell Hendricks we'll be there after sun up.
And if we see anybody on the way over there, he's gonna lose his boss.
I'll tell him.
Anybody got the time?
Two hours to sun up.
Anything I can do?
He ought to take all that stuff Ketcham signed, and get them back to the owners.
They won't know Ketcham signed these till after the trade.
Thanks.
Thanks, all of you.
I wish you luck.
Luck, he says!
We need more than luck.
We need a miracle.
How about it, Sergeant?
You think you can pass one?
Colonel, it don't seem like you want to say it, so shall I say it?
It's time.
All right, bring him up.
Shasta, you'd better wait four or five minutes after we're gone, then beat it over to your friends.
If we lose, get out of town quick.
Colonel...
- I just wanted to tell you...
- I'll be seeing you.
You'd better wipe that smile off your face, or I'll do it for you.
Hold it a minute.
Stay at this end of town and you won't get hurt.
Look out.
It's all right, Colonel McNally, they're friends.
- What are you doing here?
- They came to help.
They won't be much help unless they're real good.
- Doc gave you the deeds, didn't he?
- Sure.
But what are they worth if you lose?
- You know what you're getting into?
- We promised you in the trade, but we didn't say what condition you'd be in.
- Can any of you shoot?
- Bide's a good shot.
Remember him? His bandage on the
Captain's leg got you that headache.
- Remember, Colonel?
- I remember.
- We all fought in the war, Colonel.
- All right, you're in.
Somebody watch that back door.
You got more help than you think.
There's men behind that wall.
Could surprise those fellas and out-flank them.
- Bide, how deep is that creek?
- It changes. Three, four... six feet.
- Deep near the bridge?
- Ought to be.
I got an idea. Can you hold up this trade to give me time?
- Not for long...
- Bide, give me your gun.
- What do you plan to do?
- Ain't got time to explain, Colonel.
I can't hold up any longer.
Hendricks. Hendricks!
What do you want?
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.
You start Ketcham, we'll send Cordona.
I'd like to take a look at Cordona.
Bring him out.
- Satisfied?
- Whenever you're ready.
Hey, Colonel, he's got where he wants to be.
All right, Ketcham.
Now, you're gonna walk across there slow and easy.
- Unloosen your belt.
- What for?
To keep your hands busy.
Now walk.
That's far enough.
Here's your man.
Move.
All right. Take it nice and easy.
Hold it right where you are.
There's about six guns on you, don't move.
- Well, Sheriff, what'll it be?
- I want Ketcham.
I want him too. He's no use to you.
He's signed all those deeds back to their rightful owners.
- You're broke, both of you.
- Is that right, Ketcham?
No. Wait a minute, Tom.
He's lying. Don't shoot!
You yellow...
Get back in here, you fool.
Take it easy.
Stop your squawking. You ain't hurt.
Scattergun's useless.
Don't mind if I shoot, do you?
Makes me feel better.
There's a lot more than three out there.
They're gonna be tough to run out.
- Pete, you got the dynamite?
- I can get it.
- Can you use it on the cantina?
- Throw it through the window.
- Take Greg to back you up.
- Come on, Greg.
See those fellas?
They're trying to get around us.
- Colonel...
- I saw him.
Get a match.
Look out!
We'd have had that dynamite in our laps.
Sure lucky I brought you along.
That ought to set 'em back.
Look behind you.
Let's get outta here.
- Where are you going?
- We're licked, Sheriff.
Come back here, you lousy...
Come on back here.
- Where're you going?
- After Hendricks.
- They're running, Colonel.
- Well, Hendricks can't run far.
Look out!
Glad you brung me?
Spread out. This thing isn't over yet.
Turn around, Sheriff.
I want you to see who's gonna kill you.
You got your town back.
I... I told you I'd kill him.
- I told you, didn't I?
- You told me.
I had a right to.
I'm gonna always wear this mark.
And every time I look at it,
I wanna know I had the right to kill him.
If you hadn't done it, somebody else would have.
Now, you wanna give me a lift?
Mr McNally, you make a person feel...
Please, don't say comfortable.
Heard your paper was running an honest race.
You heard right, Mr. Gebhardt.
Well, who in hell handicapped this owlhead as a favourite?
- The smart money.
- Thaùs what we come to get.
She's all finished, boy.
Yeah, she's all finished.
Must be the dude from London.
How's he going to win a 700-mile race, sitting on a postage stamp?
He won't win.
Wonderful journey, wonderful.
Miss Jones?
Reporter for the Western Press.
- You the one said I wouldn't show up?
- I'm pleased to be wrong.
In that case, pleased to meet you.
Don't you never touch me. Never.
Morning.
How much?
Civil War? South?
These days, medals from losers is worth nothing. No offence, mister.
$300's a bet.
Check.
$250? Call.
Two pair.
You drew to an inside straight?
Ridiculous.
- I think iùs rather sporting.
- I hope your horse doesn't run as lucky.
My horse is the luckiest horse in the West, but he never plays cards for money.
We've had more than sixty letters to the editor asking why is a woman in the race.
- Written by men?
- Mostly women.
They figure you must have a special reason.
Two thousand reasons.
How about you, Mr. Carbo?
Can your horse stand up against thoroughbreds?
My bronc only has to be half as good as them hotbloods...
...'cause I'm twice as good as these oldbloods.
I've never been committed to defeat quite so tactfully.
This race will be won by a horse.
Not a mouth.
Won by a bronco.
No thoroughbred has the speed, wind or bottom of a mustang.
Not for 700 miles, and that includes your Arabian.
$5,000. My horse against the field.
- Even money?
- How about you?
- I'll cover the rest.
There's plenty more, if you're game.
One game at a time, Mr. Parker.
Where is this great horse of his, anyway?
Coming aboard next stop.
- Good to have you with us. Mr. Parker.
- Thank you.
- Where the hell is my horse? Seen her?
- Was she here?
- She's supposed to be.
- Was I supposed to see her?
You can't miss her.
She's got "champion" written all over her.
I see. That explains everything.
I don't read.
Hold your damn horses!
We're running late.
You're not leaving without my horse.
- You know the rules, Mr. Parker.
- The hell with your rules.
Afternoon.
Can you spare some milk for a hungry orphan?
He don't know anything but his mom's teat.
You like horses?
You got one of your own?
You want one?
You got one, then.
- Don't I got to pay something?
- Yeah.
Don't ever treat him bad.
You're in the big time.
I'm in the shithouse.
- Out.
- For what?
- Hustling.
- Thaùs a crime? They're all hustlers.
They work for me. You don't.
That makes it a crime.
Ride him, cowboy! Ride him!
Whiskey for me, and beer for my horse.
Cowboy always tends to his horse first.
Telegraph Chicago.
You're covered, $15,000 at 7-to-5.
$12,000 in Kansas City, even money.
- Call off all bets.
- Can't be done, baby. Iùs play or pay.
- Get through to my son.
- On his way. He'll be here before dark.
- Your father left about an hour ago.
- What about Tripoli? He show yet?
- No, sir.
- He's stupid.
$40,000 bet on a missing horse, in the hands of a fool.
- Two important regulations. Rule One...
- Win!
Rule One: Each horse must carry no less than 160 pounds...
...including rider, saddle and extras.
Rule Two: You'll be issued a compass and a map for every leg of the race.
On it, you'll find the safest route.
You don't have to take it.
You do have to make every checkpoint.
Miss one, you're disqualified.
Out of the race.
Any questions?
Jump-off time: 6:00 in the morning.
Hey, British.
Drink to the winner!
Thank you. I haven't really won the race yet. However...
Damn fine shooting, sir.
- The best, right?
- Lf you say so.
What do you say, pop?
Never saw a man yet could hold his liquor like a bottle.
Hey, you. Whaùs your name, what do you say?
You're pretty good calling a poker hand.
You care to call this hand?
You going to pass?
Nobody wants to play.
Tex, fetch a jackass.
- Anybody killed?
- Just the quart.
You done right.
A boy looking for a reputation is the most dangerous thing alive.
It certainly wasn't worth dying for.
What is?
Even if you do it, whaùs it going to prove?
Proves I can do it. Thaùs what it proves.
That your jackass?
No.
Then it ain't your business!
Never heard of Sam Clayton?
Champion of dumb animals, ladies in distress, lost kids and lost causes.
- How you been?
- Fine, till you come along.
- You want it sudden?
- Drag it out.
Palm Sunday.
Matthew 5:44.
Just like old times.
You start trouble, and I start bleeding.
- Get up, damn it!
- Palm Sunday's over.
Hurts, don't it?
Something personal?
My eyes ain't as good as his.
I might miss. You'd be dead, and I'd be out of the race for abusing a dumb animal.
Bad for you, worse for me.
Okay, pop.
- You look like a man of property.
- When I shook you, my luck changed.
- Big things?
- New things.
- Easy living?
- Right.
- Who wants easy living?
- I do.
You. You're fired.
Your job was to get J.B.'s horse on the train. That was your job.
You gave all the others a 70-mile advantage.
He was handled real easy, Mr. Parker.
Perfect condition.
Then she'll win.
If she could have won before today, she'll still win.
- Except for one thing: Me.
- And me.
Me, too.
- You'll need moving money.
- Who said I'm moving?
Staying takes even more money.
I got a month's pay coming.
A hot bath costs $5.
I guess I just won't bathe.
It takes $15 just to get drunk.
I'm going to stay sober.
$30 for an all-night woman.
Seventy miles in six hours?
Could he go 100 miles every day for a week?
That might be enough to win this race.
I came 5,000 miles to try it.
- Why?
- To beat the best.
You must be either rich or crazy.
A little of both, I'm afraid.
I came 3,000 miles for the Kentucky Derby.
Another 2,000 to see Joe Gans box Battling Nelson.
Forty-two fantastic rounds.
It was bloody marvellous.
- You know who won?
- I'm not interested.
Not interested in who won?
Thaùs not only unbelievable...
...iùs positively un-American.
What does interest you?
Right now? Just a job.
What did Parker pay you?
$50 a month? $60?
You win this race, and you'll get three years' pay.
Whaùs the horse get out of it? Colic?
Cracked bones?
You ever see a horse run himself dead just to please the man on his back? What for?
- Get his picture in the paper? For glory?
- Some men live for it.
Horse don't give a damn who wins a race.
Me, neither.
In the interest of the Wesùs greatest horse, the bronco...
...and myself, who grows them,
I'm putting up an extra $1,000...
...to the bronco rider who wins!
Matthews.
I'd like a chance to win back some of my daÔs money.
I figured you would.
- How do you like the joint?
- It ain't Kansas City.
Would you believe so many chumps in the middle of Nowhere, U.S. A?
Like shooting fish in a barrel.
- Nice, fat sucker fish.
- All you need is the right bait, Rosie.
It takes more than a deck of cards and a pair of knockers.
Horse race pulled them in.
This crowd, their hustle's the fast buck.
- Whaùs yours?
- The same.
And if you don't win, which you won't...
...I'll lend you the $2,000.
You can work it off in Kansas City.
Bang bang, you're in the chips.
At $20 a bang, out of which you get half, thaùs one hell of a lot of banging.
Iùs a hell of a lot easier on your ass than 700 miles in a saddle.
The money's for Steve.
He won't care how you got it.
- How many times you been married?
- Eleven. Ten without a preacher or license.
- Well, did you love any of them?
- All of them. Every one of them.
The good and the bad.
Iùs a shame to waste all that prime beef on a guy serving three to five in prison.
You two keep in touch?
- He's kind of a lousy letter writer.
- Lousy bank robber, too.
You have anything for a toothache?
Latest thing in miracles: Heroin.
One of these painkillers, and a chaser of whiskey:
Four hours of joyhouse!
Have you tried this heroin yourself?
Mister, I tried everything except confession.
Even God wouldn't believe it!
I've forgotten how good a bad woman feels.
Flattery and money will get you anything!
Two of the best, for two of the best.
Truly a wonderment.
Whiskey.
- You drink with greasers?
- Only seÚoritas.
My grandpa was Mexican.
I bathed that old man every day till he died.
Iùs a funny thing, though.
I never did find a greasy spot on him.
- Pure Mex ain't bad.
- Breed. You can smell it.
Well, that must be why I can't smell it.
- I'm half Cherokee.
- I'm a squaw man, myself.
Anybody pays, gets drinks.
Anybody don't like it, throw them out!
Mr. Matthews?
Business.
I'll miss your company.
Ninth, and final entry:
Clayton, riding a coldblood.
Attention. For all contestants, everything is on the house...
...except booze, betting and bawds.
What else is there?
We've got a problem.
We both can't win.
No. Thaùs not the problem.
- The problem is, I can't afford to lose.
- Who won the Gans-Nelson fight?
Gans, on a foul, in the 42nd round.
The greatest fighter I ever saw in my life, black or white.
Won me $300, which I ran into $2,000.
Most of it old Parker's money.
- Anyway...
- you know, I'm un-American?
Whaùs that?
I don't know exactly.
Except, if you're not the best...
...or the first and the greatest, if you don't win...
...then you're not American.
- Which brings us to the problem.
- I didn't know Joe Gans was a black man.
I just bet everything on this race.
I got 7-to-1.
You bet $2,000?
- On yourself?
- Who else?
Well, thaùs not so serious.
All you got to do is beat
J.B. Parker's champion horse...
...and J.B. Parker's champion rider, and J.B. Parker's champion disposition.
No. That ain't all.
My bet says no other rider in the race will beat mine.
Thaùs in writing and thaùs a problem.
Miss.
You got nothing to worry about.
You admit that you can out-drink...
...out-fight, out-shoot, out-jump...
...out-luck, out-ride any man born of woman, don't you?
Except you.
I never said I could out-ride you.
- Do we eat now, or after?
- Just so iùs not during.
Class. For a natural-born loser, you certainly got lots of class.
You just be at that finish line, with that $16,000.
He expects to win.
You saying this race is fixed?
All I know is, no matter what the game, cards, craps, racing, boxing, whatever...
If you can bet on it, it can be fixed.
Can be.
And thaùs all I know.
Well, all I know is I'm winning this race, so don't crowd me.
- How do you like it, mister?
- Without conversation.
Don't forget my bed. Get all the tables.
Don't forget the booze. Strip the joint!
Get a horse!
Maybe. Maybe thaùll save a couple miles.
Is he all right?
Splendid.
Boy, what did I do to you?
It was damn stupid of me, wasn't it?
A little over eight hours.
They ought to be strung out...
...from here to about here.
How far we come?
Halfway, I think.
- Halfway?
- To the first checkpoint.
The father of your father.
He was truly a Mejicano?
But you are simp·tico.
I had a toothache once.
I've had it. Good luck.
So long. Good luck.
What happened to the miracle painkiller?
He took six pills in one hour, instead of one every four hours.
Killed the pain all right, but he almost died.
I made him throw up the pills.
Now his toothache is back.
Can you get a dentist on that thing?
If he could, and if the dentist comes, by the time he gets here, we'll be gone.
The nearest town's 100 miles in any direction.
- He wants it pulled.
- Who by?
- By us.
- He's crazy.
- He's got a lot of faith.
- That proves he's crazy.
Checking out.
- Christie just rode out.
- So did I.
Hold this, will you?
Tooth's chipped.
That nerve is open.
Cover the tooth, and the pulling can wait.
- What about the poison?
- That goes first.
Do I cut it from the inside, or from the outside?
I'll do it.
What calibre's that tooth?
The bullet size.
Use the casing to cover the tooth.
- Smaller.
- Smaller. Okay.
Checking out.
Crank out a round for me, will you?
After you doctor him up...
...suppose he goes out and wins?
Then, what do you say?
I'd have to say, "you're out $2,000."
Checking out.
You're losing time.
Right. You won't think it unsporting?
Hell, racing for money ain't sport. Iùs war.
This linimenùs going to burn for a week.
Put a little right there.
Careful of my vitals.
- Seems you're not worried about this race.
- Yeah, seems like it.
You know, missing that train like you did yesterday...
...thaùs not like your kind of man.
You must have had a good reason.
I must have had.
Well, I don't give a damn about the reason.
I was out of hand.
I just wanted you to know that.
- Whaùs on your mind, Mr. Parker?
- I want you to come back on our team.
You get a bonus and a raise. Deal?
You just take the rest of the week off.
With pay.
How about it?
I'll look you up after the race, Mr. Parker.
Bite.
Thanks.
- Get any sleep?
- Not much.
- They gone long?
- Three, four hours.
We'll catch them before dark.
Drop it!
Drop it.
Hogtie her.
Turn around.
Morning, neighbour.
- You fixing to stay?
- No, just passing through.
Then you ain't my neighbour.
- Been here long?
- Ever since I come.
This trail here. Where does it go?
Ain't going nowhere that I know of.
Always been there.
Well, how far is it to town?
Don't know. Never measured it.
Well, you don't seem to know much.
I said, "you don't seem to know much."
I don't know a damn thing about nothing.
But I ain't the one who's lost.
Much obliged.
Jesus!
He is generous today.
One of us better know the way.
Hold him, damn it!
Muzzle that stump-sucking bastard.
I ought to bust your ass wide-open!
Lousy whore.
- Don't.
- Shut up, damn it!
You ain't nothing but a lousy crib-alley whore.
Get back that rope.
Don't say it.
Don't say it.
Don't! What he said don't bother me.
Now, quit!
Nothing to do with you.
I know you can pull this over here.
How in the hell do I pull you over there?
Good evening.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.
Miss Jones.
And how was the shorter road?
Longer.
I'll go have a look.
Watch the sport.
Miss Jones, going to need a blanket.
He's crazy! He's got to be crazy.
- Is that so?
- He tried to kill me.
Well, he couldn't have tried very hard.
Son of a bitch tried to kill me!
Why don't you tell me the story of your life.
Just skip everything but the last few minutes.
What the hell you doing down here?
By God, I'm shivering.
- Is it busted?
- Whaùs busted is my pump.
- How do you know?
- Army doc. Couple of years back.
He said, "When that pain hits your arm, thaùs the alarm bell.
"When it hits your pump right after, thaùs it."
Can you make it to the checkpoint?
No.
Come on, iùs only a couple of hours.
Easy ride.
Leùs try.
You certainly have a knack of provoking a man to violence.
- All I said was that she was...
- It was the way you said it.
Like an insult.
- When a woman does it for money...
- A man gets the best of the bargain.
Before you take her to bed, she's a thing of beauty.
In bed, an angel of mercy.
- Afterwards, she's a...
- Whore.
- A pillow of peace.
- A whore!
Thaùs what Clay married in the war.
Cuba, '98.
She's the only woman Clay ever loved.
How about you?
I was never that lucky.
Let go. I don't want them to know.
I ain't run out of my string yet.
- Evening. Thank you.
- Old man, I thought sure you'd cashed it in.
- Not till I'm back in Oklahoma.
- I'd rather be in hell than Oklahoma.
Every man to his own country.
Thanks.
Why didn't you take the barge across?
Against your religion?
You know Injun ponies. Said if he couldn't go on a canoe, he'd rather swim.
- Well, I saved you some supper.
- Thaùs good.
I want it served by one of them nice ladies wearing nothing but a big smile.
Done!
Why?
Why, in damn it, would a sick old man like you get tangled up in all this?
Why, in the name of sweet Jesus?
What is so important about this gut-twisting, back-busting...
...man-killing goddamn race?
- The money?
- The prize.
- The prize is the money.
- The prize is winning.
Lose, you're nothing.
Who remembers a loser, or even cares?
Win, you're somebody.
What you done, iùs printed.
Iùs in a newspaper.
And when iùs printed, it ain't brag.
Iùs real.
Suddenly, everybody knows you, or wants to.
Strangers shaking your hand.
"Pleased to know you.
"Have a drink, have a cigar.
Meet the wife."
Everybody's friendly and welcome.
I got a lifetime hunger for being welcome.
No family?
Him.
You know saddle tramps. They sign on...
...drive the beef 1,000 miles, make your mark...
...draw your pay, and move on to the next ranch.
Another round up. Another drive.
Hired, fired, and move on.
Never bothered me none.
No. Me neither, when I was 30 years lighter.
Ever prospected?
Ever hit pay dirt?
I've dug for gold, silver, lead, mercury.
I've dug more holes than a whole regiment of gophers.
I never dug out a decent day's wage yet.
God, what ain't I tried.
Pony Express rider, overland stage driver...
...lawman, gambler, river man, rancher...
...rodeo hand, barman...
...spittoon man. Old man.
Nothing much to remember.
Of course, there ain't nothing much to forget, either.
Nobody's got much use for an old man.
I can't blame them much.
Thaùs why I'm going to win me this here newspaper race.
When I cross that finish line,
I get to be a big man.
Top man.
A man to remember.
I didn't even know your name, mister.
A couple of miles out from here,
47 miles of desert. Nothing but sand.
An ocean of it. By night, cold.
Hostile, but easier going.
By day, a blazing hellhole.
Halfway across, water stop.
The only one.
Miss that water, you're in trouble.
If you're lucky, eight hours in the devil's own frying pan.
Railroad. We'll wait here till noon.
Can you beat the desert before sunup?
Well, how does it shape up?
Tight.
You're not worried? Who by?
An old man, a girl, a punk kid.
Where's the class?
Kids and old men don't respect class.
And don't sell the girl short.
- Lf she ever cut that brute of hers loose...
- Why would she hold back?
Probably too green to know better, but the Mexican's not. And he's tough.
- Anytime we can't beat a Mexican...
- Horseshit.
- And that stubborn Englishman...
- He'll never keep up the lick.
Tell that to him! I lose him, I look around, he's biting my ass.
- Sand dunes will finish him.
- The tougher it gets, the better he likes it.
The same goes for Matthews.
What he hasn't got in horse, he makes up for in brass.
Cuts every corner, takes a lot of chances, and he's lucky.
That cowboy you fired...
- So far, he's showed nothing.
- So far, maybe he ain't tried.
His bronc's a real stayer. Tough hide.
He's got the heart.
Cowboy's got the know-how.
He's the sleeper. The one to beat.
- We'll beat him.
- Yeah.
News. We're big news everywhere.
"Chicago. Adding $250 to purse and will headline winner in my Wild West Show.
"Signed, 'Buffalo' Bill Cody."
- Wasn't he the fastest gun in the West?
- Only in bed, kiddo.
"London. To Sir Harry Norfolk," our Englishman:
"Up the British. Signed, Prince of Wales."
Invitations to the winner from
Rome, Paris, Moscow. All expenses paid.
And, get this.
From the President of the United States:
"To all the intrepid contestants.
Bully for you!
"To the two Rough Riders, Clayton and
Matthews, who served with me in Cuba...
"...remember San Juan Hill.
Charge, boys, charge!"
Look him over. Fast!
- What happened to the old man?
- He's dead.
Get moving. I'm going out.
- This horse is running a temperature.
- Iùs nothing that will bother him.
I'll be fine.
Son of a bitch.
I'm going to catch me that champion.
Yes, sir. I'm going to catch him before this day is done.
Salt.
Could I ask you something? Your wife...
...where is she?
I was wondering how you met.
I work for Rosie. Off and on, about a year.
I guess that don't surprise you none.
The only thing that surprises me is the people some people marry.
Because she was a whore?
A Cuban.
Paula was a Cuban insurrecto.
Guerrillas, fighting the Spanish, just like we was.
Thaùs where we met. On the battlefield.
That was our wedding bed till that day.
We came out of the jungle, and there it was, San Juan Hill.
Spanish guns looking right down our throat and sharpshooters picking us off.
We just charged right up that hill.
Thaùs not the way it happened at all.
It wasn't anything like it was in San Antonio, where we did our training.
Thaùs where I ran into Luke...
...and a lot of other men from every other country...
...that wanted to be Rough Riders.
Bakers and barbers.
Congressmen and cattlemen.
Ballplayers, farmers, reporters, cowboys.
No, we didn't rough ride up that hill...
...'cause we didn't have any horses.
We didn't charge up there, either.
We crawled up there on our scared bellies.
There was only one horse and one rider.
That was Colonel Teddy.
He went charging up that damn hill.
They shot his glasses off.
He put on another pair.
They nicked him in the elbow.
And he said, "Follow me!"
And we did,
'cause we were too damn ashamed not to.
After the Hill, came the church.
There was a French 75 out front.
Every window had a rifle sticking out of it.
There was a Gatling gun in the bell tower.
We could have called the artillery boys in to blow it to pieces...
...but outside, along the walls...
...they'd tied all these people up.
Roped them together, hogtied them.
Looked like a bunch of sandbags.
Women and children, nuns and prisoners.
My Paula among them.
Neither me nor Luke nor anybody else knew what to do.
Inside the church, they knew what to do.
They opened up on us and we fell back.
All of a sudden, I heard Paula scream out:
"Asalto, Cubanos, asalto!"
Then, a Spanish bullet.
The rest of the women took up the cry.
"Attack, Cubans, attack! Attack!"
Her own band of guerrillas led the way.
The people some people marry.
I wasn't worth her spit.
Bury him.
- What with?
- Your goddamn hands.
See he does it.
You see to it.
What he said. Is it that important?
It must be. He said it twice.
It was Gans in the 42nd round!
Anyway, he's walking in from a couple of miles back.
Didn't want me to carry the extra weight.
He said it wasn't sporting.
- Hey, kid!
- Yes, sir.
- I'm going to lay a chore on you.
- Yes, sir.
Take the old-timer's horse there.
We got a problem with those prisoners.
They're all maximum-security.
Our plan still holds.
Look for this mark on the left front hoof.
No horse passes through without this mark.
List of riders.
To you, this race is worth about $2,000.
To me, iùs worth $14,000.
Now, say iùs you and me in front...
...coming down the stretch.
Got the picture?
You hold back. Make it look good, of course. I win.
I collect my bet, turn the prize money over to you. Nobody gets hurt...
...except old Parker, who's out $14,000, which is only justice.
Yeah, you're right.
- I could never do that to my best friend.
- Only friend.
- So we split 50-50. Deal?
- No deal.
- You want more than me?
- What I want is...
Name it.
What I'm going to do is win this race.
That is the greediest, most selfish thing that...
Do you realise you're betraying a friend?
If it ain't by a friend, it ain't betrayal.
Thank you.
Got it.
Not hungry?
Miss?
Sorry about all those things I said.
All this hardware.
I ain't never been in a gunfight.
Killing a man don't prove you're a man.
I ain't never been a cowboy, either, like I said.
I know.
I've been around a lot of cowhands, one way or another.
Cowboy dresses from the top down.
First thing on is his hat.
And he undresses from his boots up.
Last thing off, hat.
Another thing. To be a cowpuncher.
That don't mean you got to go around punching them.
Yes, ma'am.
Laudanum.
Supposed to make you sexy-sleepy.
Well, I've got no such problems.
I got to get me some sleep. I can't sleep.
Guilty conscience.
Why? 'Cause I won't throw the race?
Nothing so hard on a man as virtue.
How could you know?
According to the Gospel of Old Luke Matthews.
"Virtue is its own punishment."
You might say this is our Last Supper.
Beyond that next mountain, iùs all downhill to the finish line.
And you, Mr. Norfolk.
Will you be with us at the finish?
I wouldn't miss it.
To the West!
Awesome, but inspiring.
What the hell's inspiring about a flash flood or a blizzard?
Or a landslide or sandstorm or dust storm?
Any sudden disaster, personal or financial?
Today, the desert broiled you raw.
Tomorrow, the mountain'll freeze you stiff.
Thaùs your West. Violent, treacherous.
Where every prairie dog hole is a goldmine.
Every molehill is a mountain. Every creek is a river, and everybody you meet is a liar.
"When you call me that, smile, stranger."
The Virginian, Owen Wister. Another liar.
For a family who don't know a jackass from a mule, you know about the West.
We don't have to know about it.
We own it.
Bastard! You poisoned him!
- Wait, Miss Rosie.
- Who paid you?
- Him?
- Nobody.
- Bitch! Where'd you get this?
- A couple of days ago.
For me! For when I can't sleep.
Neither could he. Ask him!
No, she's right!
Iùs just supposed to make you sleepy.
Thaùs all.
Mix it with booze...
...you get one hell of a Mickey Finn.
See you.
Bet your ass!
- Your name?
- Jones.
Stretch! Face down.
Steve.
Kate. The rifle!
What about those two, Steve?
Just where the hell do they fit in?
I need them. They're coming with us.
How?
- You're not taking this horse.
- His and two more. Thaùs the plan.
The plan was us! Nobody else!
You and me, out of here on my horse.
Will you for Chrisùs sake shut up?
Dirty business.
You never think, maybe, to win this damn race?
They hurt you?
I have seen many bullets.
Too many.
But this one...
Truly, did you ever know...
...a bullet that is good for the health?
The key!
How do you start it? How do you make it go and how do you stop it?
Take your hand off the clutch!
- I'd like to go with them.
- This horse stays here.
That makes it a one-horse race.
Thaùs not the kind of race I wanted to win.
Set a reasonable time for them to get back with their horses.
If they get back.
If he gets into those woods...
Hey, kid! The horse!
Miss Jones.
The people some people marry.
(Screaming and gunshots continue in distance)
(Sioux) Take their horses and young squaws.
Yellow Hands must leave here or we kill them all.
Zenas! Zenas Morro!
Viens ici. Les sauvages...
They are coming.
- Gryce.
- Zenas.
It's all over.
Them Yellow Hands won't be bustin' up your traps no more.
That Owl. Will he work for us?
I don't know. He did a good job this time.
Them that ain't dead's runnin'.
Chemin, tell the chief that he'll be well rewarded for helping us out today.
Tell him that we claim all these beaver creeks and Yellow Hand country by right of discovery.
Tell him we'll buy the Yellow Hand squaws and use them around here for slaves.
But put a mark on them so we can tell them from the Ricks.
And tell Owl him and his Ricks can live outside the fort. We'll take care of them.
I know that Hudson Bay Company - they'll be wantin' to move in on the territory, so you tell this savage son of a bitch we'll pay him to protect our trappers from all hostiles, red or white.
You tell him we'll pay his Ricks with gold.
(Chemin) They don't care about no gold.
Then give them some whiskey.
(Sioux) We leave our blood on the sacred land.
Here we are! Here we are!
# Sanctify
# Sanctify this water, Lord, we pray
# In the fullness of thy grace
# Of thy grace
# O Lord, we pray
# Sanctify... #
Thank you for coming.
I love you.
# In the fullness of thy grace
# Of thy grace
# O Lord, we pray
# Sanctify
# Sanctify this water, Lord, we pray #
I'm sorry.
# In the fullness of thy grace
# Of thy grace #
Yes.
Denham. Get me Denham.
I see you've made your decision.
Yes, Denham, I have. I'm going back.
- How soon will you be leaving?
- Soon. Right away.
- How long will you be gone?
- How long?
- One year, and no more.
- I understand.
And, Denham, look after the place for me while I'm gone.
I hope you find what you're looking for.
Thank you.
(Sioux) Shunkawakan greets the Yellow Hand people.
(Sioux) A son of the Yellow Hands has returned.
(Lord John) Hello there!
Could you tell me who the proprietor of this residence is?
What the hell is that?
Could I come in, please?
Thank you.
Thank you. That's most civil of you.
- Mon dieu!
- Bonjour, monsieur. Comment ça va?
I say, could you look at the foreleg of my horse?
Blazing hot, the sun.
I brought this for the rain, you know.
My horse?
Come on. Get up here. Hurry!
See? The woman is ours.
Absolutely not done, old boy. Not done.
Get off of me!
Gryce! Quiet!
Are you going to waste your time with that?
What an extraordinary beast.
I'm so glad you stopped him.
- Now, who in God's name are you?
- I am doing a survey of the West.
It appears your president -
Jackson, I believe his name is - regards everything west of the Missouri as worthless.
Two dollars, I believe, is all it's worth.
- So William sent me for a look-see.
- William? William who?
The fourth, old boy. His Majesty. Our King.
I do beg your pardon. My name is McClory,
Seventh Duke of Kildare. And you?
Morro. Zenas Morro. I run this place.
Ah. And a jolly little fort it is, too.
You're wrong, friend.
This is a peaceful trading post.
We're friendly to all trappers and Indians.
How could you be so naive?
There is no such thing as friendly natives.
- I must move on. My horse?
- (Blacksmith) Nothing wrong with it.
Thank you, old boy.
Maybe you ought to stay here for the night.
Another time, old boy, another time.
- Do you know the Hudson Bay Company?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure, old boy. Quite sure.
Oh! By the by...
As a matter of historical reference, what happened to that band of savages, the ones that were camped nearby?
Something "Hands," they were called.
- Yellow Hands.
- Precisely.
I knew it was some vulgar colour like that.
They moved on.
I was told that Indians never leave their sacred burial grounds.
- Well, you were told wrong.
- Oh, good.
I did think it rather unhygienic to reside amidst one's decaying ancestors.
You knew them, these Yellow Hands?
- Come back here!
- (Screaming and crying)
Now, there's one of your Yellow Hands.
Nothing but trouble.
Open the gates!
You know, fraternising sexually with a native is not done, old boy.
In the best of circles, that is.
Well, good luck with your little fort.
Gryce, get your mind off that squaw.
I want you to track that dandified son of a bitch.
He's a spy for the Hudson's Bay Company.
I swear it.
He's not alone.
Find out who's with him and how many.
Then we'll send out a scalping party.
Son of a bitch. He's alone.
Hey.
(Sioux) Go back, tell Zenas the Englishman is travelling alone.
I will bring his scalp... Go!
Get out of here... (Mumbles indistinctly)
It's you.
What the hell are you doing?
Well, I'm not making a spot of tea, old boy.
The Yellow Hands. Where are they?
The Ricks massacred them.
- And the survivors?
- There wasn't any.
Where are the survivors?
There was a few women and kids. The
Ricks slaved them and sold some to us.
Where are they?
What the hell difference does it make?
They're gone! They're finished!
Where are they?
South... southeast! Into the Badlands!
Now cut me loose!
Come on! Cut it!
(Lord John) Her name was Wi-Wacapi, by the way.
The young girl you shot... in the back.
You been here before.
It means "Moonstar".
I knew her when she was twelve.
You'll never see any of your Yellow Hand friends alive.
My Ricks will track you down wherever you go.
Shunkawakan.
(Sioux) Shunkawakan has returned.
Come and greet Shunkawakan, he is one of us.
Don't be afraid.
Shunkawakan is a Yellow Hand.
(Sioux) Chief Lame Wolf...
Remember my son, Standing Bear?
(Sioux) No horses... no buffalo... we eat our dogs.
(Sioux) I bring gifts for everyone.
Great covering for head of great chief.
Here. Here.
(Sioux) For fighting.
(Sioux) For hunting. For fighting.
Raven.
Morgan.
Go, friend.
There is nothing here for you. Go.
(Sioux) Is it not a good omen that he returns?
No! The evil spirit watches us...
We offer the gifts to him!
Sign say Yellow Hand spirit fly away.
Lose sacred rock and old burial ground.
Cannot go back.
Have no place.
Elk Woman, I have brought horses, guns.
We'll hunt the buffalo again.
We'll have meat, teepees, and a new life.
Buffalo spirit gone.
No hunt.
Heart full of pain.
Elk Woman... to give up hope is to die.
We must wait for sign from evil spirit.
There is no evil spirit, only evil men.
Tomorrow, when the gifts I have brought for the people are returned, then the Yellow Hands will be strong again and destroy the enemy.
You talk like white man, Shunkawakan.
Guns no good against evil spirit.
Everything is gone.
Gone.
Well, if everything is gone, then the evil spirit is satisfied and the Yellow Hands are free.
He wants more?
You've hidden everything, haven't you, Raven?
You've hidden everything.
Now, where are they?
Where are they?
Where are they? (Echoes)
- Everybody!
- (Chanting and drumming resumes)
Come up here and help me find the guns!
Help me find the guns!
Elk Woman, help me!
Talk to the people! Tell them!
(Sioux) I have brought horses... we can hunt the buffalo again.
(Sioux) You need the Buffalo Spirit to fight the men at the fort.
Tell them, Elk Woman!
They must fight back! They must!
Or they will die! The people will die!
Shunkawakan, why you come back?
- You look for something?
- Oh, yes.
Look for something that I found when I was here before... the power of the great spirit.
I tried to take it back with me to England, but when I got there, it left me.
And now I'm lost.
I'm lost.
So I came back.
I came back, only to find the people as broken... and as lost as I am.
All waiting to die.
- We wait for sign.
- For what sign?
For lightning to strike the fort?
If evil spirit go away,
Yellow Hand kill enemy.
Go back to sacred land.
Your enemies are not afraid of the evil spirit, Elk Woman.
They've got guns, cannon, power.
If Yellow Hands all die... that is way it will be.
You're not afraid of death?
Are you afraid to die?
You have forgot much.
Elk Woman...
Help me.
- Help me.
- You must forget yourself.
Fast four days and four nights.
Purify your body.
Seek your vision.
You must suffer for the people.
Then you will be reborn.
I send my voice to the four corners of the universe, to the earth and sky and all that breathes and grows on the land and flies above it.
In these things, your spirit lives.
Send me the vision so I may earn the right to hold the sacred pipe... and through it, find the way.
This is the centre of the universe.
It is a circle without beginning and without end.
And in it you will find your own centre... where there is no future and no past.
The smoke from the sacred pipe, mixed with my breath, will rise and spread throughout the universe, and become one with the breath of the great spirit, who has now shown me the way.
(Lord John) Oh, Wakhán Thánka, you see here a sacred place.
You see here a sacred centre which we have fixed, and in which I shall suffer.
O great spirit, on behalf of the people,
I offer all my suffering.
(Sioux) Great Evil Spirit... free us!
(Chanting, drumming and whistling continues)
(Sioux) O Thunder God...
Do not destroy the Yellow Hands.
I give my life so the people may live!
Stop!
- My God.
- Morgan.
Morgan.
Shh, Raven, Raven...
(Whispering) Raven... the Yellow Hands have suffered enough.
I understand now.
(Sioux) My people are free.
(Sioux) What you have done is sacred.
You have suffered for your people.
Now the Great Spirit is within us.
We are reborn!
(Man yelling and grunting, children laughing)
Buffalo give his spirit to our people.
So the children can play at revenge?
No. For fighting.
We're too few, Elk Woman.
We're too few.
(Sioux) Like brothers we share the smoke of the sacred pipe.
All the Lakota people are happy that our Yellow Hand brothers... again hunt the buffalo.
Red Cloud, the Rickarees who now live near the fort... are strong and keep us from our land.
You should fight to the death to keep your sacred land.
Red Cloud...
That is precisely why they're here.
They want help to fight the white trapper.
- White men of river?
- Yes.
Our brothers.
Give us knives. Arrowhead.
Take few furs. They give us gun.
The white man has come to strip the land and to own it.
Own land?
How can land be owned?
Can man own rock? Tree?
Bird? Mountain?
Own man's heart?
Where the sun rises and the great rivers flow,
I have seen land and all that grows there and lives on it owned by the white man.
- You lie!
- No! No, white man lies!
You white man! You lie!
White man of river our brothers.
Red Cloud...
He... He has come to ask for a few of your warriors because the Yellow Hands have not got enough men.
Then let your women fight!
- (Speaks Sioux)
- (Laughter)
(Sioux) We will do our own fighting.
(Sioux) How many braves come to help us?
(Sioux) None!
(Sioux) We give you your life.
Tell your people the Yellow Hands want to live in peace.
(Sioux) Now the Yellow Hands all die.
(Sioux) Yellow Hands are gone!
Well, it's better than nothing.
(Chemin) Bonjour, Zenas.
(Zenas) Chemin.
Very good.
I have a present for you, my little savage.
Look, eh? Iron. Very valuable.
I'll make you a bracelet. All right?
Come here.
All right. Good, huh?
All right.
Another one.
Like it?
Ahhh... beautiful!
You know, those Indians. Happy slaves.
(Lord John, in Sioux) Take no chances... wait until the attack begins.
(Woman, in Sioux) I understand.
Well done.
Come back here. You behave yourself.
You know I love you. Come here.
Everyone to their post!
Be on the alert for attack!
You dirty squaw.
What in hell are you men doing there?
Get away from there!
Get to your posts! You, get!
Load that cannon!
Chemin!
Why didn't you sound the alarm?
Damn Yellow Hands!
Where the hell did they come from?
They're getting away! Fire!
(Sioux) Stay out of the woods. It is a trap.
(Zenas) What's going on down there?
Those are Yellow Hand squaws.
They're sneaking up on our Ricks.
Come on, boy.
Barricade that gate! Reload the cannon!
Get up there!
All right, get that cannon ready to fire.
Attention! Over here! Another rider!
Oh, no. Keep this loaded and firing.
Give me a hand.
You don't fool me!
You want it all for yourself!
Damn savages.
Pagan filth!

ENHOH
Ladies and gentlemen your attention please.
What you are about to experience is not a show for entertainment.
It is a review of the events that made the American frontier.
In less than 15 years, this nation will celebrate the 20th century.
We do not know what awaits us in the future but we do know the past that laid the foundation.
And that foundation was not built from heroes but from the anonymous settler.
Their home was but a shack roofed in with sod.
One door shut out the wind and storm one window greeted the dawning day.
These brave souls survived not only nature but the savage instincts of man.
Paving the way for the heroes that endured.
Get the rifle!
So welcome to the real events enacted by men and women of the American frontier.
To whose courage strength, and above all, faith this piece of history is dedicated.
Or:
Cease action!
From the beginning... one... two...
Are you in costume?
I want everybody in costume now.
Mr. Salsbury!
Yes?
What is it?
A horse stepped through him.
Don't touch him.
Get Eats Rabbit to the dispensary.
His name is Brown Horse.
Be careful with him.
Tell Joy not to get on the horse from the back. Doesn't look authentic.
I was thinking of setting the hut on fire. Not a bad idea.
So one day
I was walking through the camp.
I saw this scrawny looking kid under a wagon.
I take one look at him and I know I can make him a star.
I ask him his name.
He says, "Cody, Bill Cody."
I say, "What do you do?" He says
"I'm a scout and a buffalo hunter."
Well, I want to write about somebody.
I had all these new plots for Hickok but I was mad at him.
So I say to the kid
"Your name is now Buffalo Bill and in 6 months, the whole country will know about you."
At a church service in Deadwood
I met and rubbed elbows with a young man named William F. Cody.
I was so impressed by his skill as a marksman by his success as a hunter that I named him
"Buffalo Bill."
Nate, take a look.
She's doing good with her left hand.
Show him, honey.
Beautiful. Just like the old missy.
The stories were a big success.
The kid is scared to death about the legend I created but ex cited about his new fame.
And I say one thing just one thing
"Bill, any youngster figures to set the world on fire best not forget where he got the matches.
I want you to back me up on this one against Bill.
Which is why you've gotta make it clear to Bill how serious it could be.
Are you listening to me, Nate?
Ex cuse me, we're trying to have a conversation about Annie Oakley.
I don't want to push you, but I am her husband and have a solemn duty...
Dammit, are you gonna tell him or not?
Maybe you should tell him yourself, Frank.
What can I do for you?
All right, I will.
Major Burke's in there with him...
Oh yeah? It's damn important.
Good to see you, Frank.
My glass suddenly got empty. Could you put a couple of fingers in there?
Thank you, Frank.
My pleasure. If you don't want to play Mexicans I've got other people.
We still want to be part of the show.
You do? As Mexicans? No...
I used to play a colored.
Do I look like a colored? No, sir.
When I had to play a colored
I was a colored.
Good you can be
Rodriguez and Ricardo.
Or "Los latiguerros Mexico" that has to do with whips.
Frank would you mind gettin' out of my... Conference, Bill.
...my conference here and waitin' like the others?
Ed!
Yes, sir?
I thought I said no interruptions.
You gotta honor my wishes.
Adios, pard. Wish me luck.
You got me, you don't need luck.
And anything historical is mine.
Everything historical is yours, Bill.
Going past the dispensary?
Yeah, come on.
Major! Yes?
"Bull's eye. Heroic villains.
Revolutionize. Injuns. Whites."
What's the plot, Major?
You string those pearls together and write a unique Buffalo Bill fable.
Let me read it when I get back.
I'll even give you the legend.
Enemies in '76, friends in '85.
Ah, Shakespeare of the half dime.
Sit down.
Something's up, Ned. Bill sent
Burke out of here on the fly.
Any ideas?
Burke gave me a few clues.
Injuns and whites heroic villain, 50 bucks a week foes in '75, friends in '86.
Foes in '75...
Friends in '86...
Bill's in the big time now.
He can afford to spend $50 a week.
Now tell me what Injun villain is worth that much?
Sitting Bull!
Is he tame?
What about the army?
The army would love it.
They can't shoot him.
Not until the Sioux sign the treaties.
So they make a fool of him in a Wild West show.
A rock ain't a rock once it's gravel.
What'd he mean by "rock and gravel?"
That he's lost his power.
Authors always have their literalisms.
I hear the new act is General Custer's brother.
That's not what we heard.
What'd you hear?
We know who it is, Eddy.
Who?
Sitting Bull.
Is he interested in the show business?
If he wasn't he wouldn't have become a chief.
In my youth I fought with a young brave of the Sioux tribe named Standing Bull.
And I beat him.
When he sat on the ground after the fight was over and swore revenge on me by all the Gods of heaven and hell
I laughed at him and called him "Sitting Bull."
I tell you, there's no business like show business.
People say that Bill's destroyed his reputation by drinking. It ain't so.
He wouldn't let anything harm his troop.
So you can put those stories to rest.
But Bill's drinking that's a different matter.
2 months ago, Nate Salsbury asked Bill to stop drinking.
And Bill promises solemnly to never be seen drunk again.
Till one day Bill says to Nate he's been giving it some thought and he'll need at least one drink a day.
Of course Bill's daily ration comes in a glass the size of a small ship.
Ladies and gentlemen
America's national entertainer.
Put it together for William F. Cody
Buffalo Bill!
Great start.
See that girl who works in the laundry over there?
I saw here the other day, between the tents... hugging a man.
Don't talk to Annie while she's shooting.
You're shaking.
Honey, I'm fighting the wind.
Get everybody to the podium.
The entire company to the podium.
You look very stylish, Missy.
We thought we'd bitten off more than was chewable.
And that by enlarging our show we had possibly disimproved it.
Oh, that's fine, really fine.
Bill, I have got to talk to you.
We got a serious problem.
Ned Buntline's back again.
Why didn't you tell me?
...even down to the Indians.
Watch this.
Now, Nate Salsbury doesn't long wind.
But he want's to say he's proud that you're proud to be part of
America's national family.
I know you'll be upset if he writes anything harmful about our Annie.
Buntline is here. Say the word and I'll have him removed.
I couldn't do that, Nate.
Look, get rid of him without me telling him. And don't tell me.
What's going on over there?
It's Brown Horse's funeral.
He died three days ago.
Wasn't he Shoshone?
Yes.
I won the medal of honor for killing every Shoshone in a raiding party.
Doesn't seem long ago.
You rode into the valley of death and rode out again.
The last thing a man wants to do is the last thing he does.
That was the best rehearsal yet.
Your entrance was tremendable.
That was a good idea of yours.
Giving the Injuns slower horses.
Bill?
Money in the bank.
Remember what I told you about telling me. I won't tell you.
Business is good.
And it's getting better.
That's 'cause times are bad and getting worse.
Show business flourishes when times are bad.
I hope it stays that way.
Well, if it ain't nervous Nate.
You're not doing anybody a favor by being here.
I ain't in the favor business.
I want you to leave my camp, now.
It surely is your camp, ain't it?
And you're doing a fine job.
Better than I could.
What a citizen you've made of Bill.
Doesn't seem like the same man.
Never looks bad in public.
All I care about is the Wild West.
We're going to Codyfy the world.
Why didn't I think of that?
Because I tell him the truth.
And in the end we always agree.
If two partners always agree then one of them ain't necessary.
We just signed the most futurable act in our history. I don't want problems.
Who's the act?
Sitting Bull.
That's quite a coup.
But you tell Bill Cody that I don't leave until he personally invites me out.
The great chief of the Sioux tribe
Sitting Bull, is here with us.
And he'll be in the same arena with the noblest white skin of all.
I'm speaking about...
...the great counterpoint...
Sitting Bull and William F. Cody!
Nate, John's going to ride to the top of Bill's list for this one.
Charm, sincerity, sweetness and youthfulness speak of the man as the recreation of God in human form.
Uncle Will you only got a few minutes.
He must be the big one in the red blanket. No ordinary Indian.
I ain't buying no ordinary Indian.
Go help Nate with the welcoming committee.
Great, great event.
He's got more scalps than any other Indian chief alive.
Ready?
No.4, "Major Burke's Return."
We have met the enemy and he is ours.
That gentle Sweeny a melody for every momentous moment.
Where's Bill?
I don't know.
Come here and look at Sitting Bull.
That sumbitch must be 7 feet tall!
He's getting smaller every year.
I'm ready to dispose of my prisoner.
McLaughlin, you are now in Codyland.
Sitting Bull is no prisoner, he is a star in the Buffalo Bill heavens.
He's a murderer and my responsibility till I turn him over to Cody.
Let me introduce Mr. Nate Salsbury.
Nate, this remarkable character is James McLaughlin.
I trust you had a pleasant trip.
I hate horsebacking, especially to deliver Indians to some circus.
The Wild West Show is not a circus.
This is show business and Buffalo Bill has an unerring sense of theatrical timing.
That's my star.
He belongs to all of us, Nate.
Our star. America's.
Chief Sitting Bull
Killer of Custer.
I hope you had a comfortable journey, Major.
Gentlemen, this is a moment fraught with friendship with history humming harmonic overtones.
Bill, I have the distinct pleasure of presenting Chief Sitting Bull.
Chief, I'm pleased to present to you the Honorable William F. Cody
Buffalo Bill!
I would like to congratulate you on your arrival and extend a titanically momentous welcome to Buffalo Bill's Wild West.
Now me and my staff are the best at what we do.
And what we do is make the best look better.
Hiya, Chief!
It's the runt.
My name is William Halsey.
Sitting Bull speaks through me.
His long incarceration has emptied his strength and he wishes to rest.
What's incarceration?
Jail.
Halsey's a white name, isn't it?
Got some white blood in you, Halsey?
Halsey, tell your chief that the people standing here are part of the finest spectacle in show business.
I've watched them grow from plain, raw talent to personages of importance.
Tell your chief we can do that for him, too.
And after on season in this show he'll never be mistaken for a below average run of the mill Indian chief.
Plus he'll have something to fall back on in his later years.
Long trip, huh, Chief?
I just wanted to welcome you here to Buffalo Bill's Wild West.
You'll find it ain't all that different from real life.
Gentlemen, Injuns...
Why didn't you tell me which one he was?
How big is he off the horse?
Don't worry.
He's big enough to fill the arena.
So Sitting Bull's the little fellow.
He doesn't look so savage.
I'll sleep with a shotgun anyway.
Sitting Bull's famous for scalping folks in their beds.
I hope Bill can handle him.
I don't think it disappropriate to play a personal chord here.
We all know sociable chaff is cheap but history...
...real history... is hard come.
The man I'm about to celebrate is not a mere personation of a patriot but the true monarch of genuity.
Scout, show man family person, valued partner...
America's National Entertainer
William Frederick..."Bill"...
Sitting Bull won't live with the other Indians.
What was that? Sitting Bull doesn't seem to like his recommodations.
What's wrong?
He didn't say why.
He wants to live across the river.
He wants to live across the river!
If you're smart you'll lock them dog eaters in the stockade.
Nobody can cross that river.
Impossible. We've already lost
3 horses, 6 Blackfeet and a bargeload of show equipment, worth $ 16000.
Impossible to cross, huh?
That's exactly where I want him on that flat ridge there.
That way I can watch him all the time from my chair.
The difference between a white man and an Injun in a situation like this is us whites are smart enough to know an Injun always turns down your first offer.
Laugh it up, boys.
Uncle Will how did Sitting Bull cross the river?
Shall we call for help?
We are the help.
Shouldn't we holler for help?
I'll handle this. Bill, Sitting Bull's coming here with his whole group.
Our unpredictable friends seem to be on the warpath. I see them.
They crossed the river again and they ain't even wet.
They did, huh?
We're with you, Bill.
Sonia, finish that later.
Well, Chief...
A twilight raid, huh?
What's on your mind?
Sitting Bull is here by the will of the Great Spirits.
By their will he is chief.
His heart is red, sweet, for whatever passes licks him with his tongue.
The bears taste the honey and the leaves lick the sky.
The Great Spirits have chosen
Sitting Bull as leader of their land.
Halsey tell Sitting Bull that Buffalo Bill says his leaves can turn how he wants, so long he knows how the wind is blowing.
I think I gave him back the same murky logic he gave us.
What Buffalo Bill means...
He doesn't need an interpreter.
Buffalo Bill means that Sitting Bull is here to relive his history for thousands of paying customers.
Sitting Bull says history is simply disrespect for the dead.
When did he say that?
He's not even listening.
Sitting Bull's mind is rested and he's ready to negotiate.
What? That's been done. Right, Burke?
Sitting Bull wants blankets.
They're cold. Couldn't we write
8, 10 blankets into the deal?
Sitting Bull wants blankets for all his people.
Hold on. What do you think this is? An Army surplus store?
There are only 106
Hunkpapa Sioux left at Grand River.
God, Burke, five years ago we counted 10000 braves alone.
Mr. Halsey, we're delighted to give the blankets as a gift to those people.
Burke, get a story out on this right away.
Splash it over the front pages.
"The benevolence of Buffalo Bill."
A fascinating follow up to today's events, Chief.
Negotiations settled.
See that he doesn't steal anything.
Sitting Bull want 6 weeks salary sent to his people now.
He wants what?
I thought Burke took care of that.
Music box.
Makes music.
Halsey, there's no prepayment without a contract.
And he will own his own photographs.
Like hell! I own all rights.
Sitting Bull says his face belongs to him and he owns his photographs.
My ass!
Nate!
That's robbery, and he knows it!
I won't put up with it!
We won't put up with it.
It's bedlam in here.
I'm going to take a nap.
Margaret!
Stop that singing.
You getting' sharp with me, Bill?
You see?
You've upset Buffalo Bill.
Halsey, tell the chief we pay for work performed.
If he wants to sign a six month contract, that's different.
No contract.
Why not?
All the other top acts have them.
He won't sign what he may not honor.
Why couldn't he?
Sitting Bull stays only until he sees the great father. The President?
Yes.
Did Burke promise you that?
Sitting Bull no longer accepts promises from white men.
His dreams told him he would meet the great father here.
He is here because he dreamed he would meet President Cleveland?
Dead on, Bill.
What does she say this time?
"Dear husband, your deeds as a frontier hero are pale compared to your adventures with opera singers and milk maids."
Dead on, Bill!
"You are also the cheapest man who ever lived and a profane drunkard."
That's Mr. Oakley.
The name is Butler.
"I have instructed my lawyers to draw up divorce articles ensuring our separation and making me a rich woman."
I want you to miss this one just until you get the feel of it.
Take your time.
You can miss by a lot, darling.
Good, right in the middle.
Did you want to hit it in the middle?
"...your wife, Lulu."
I'm gettin' longer cigars. You'll feel more comfortable with them.
Buffalo Bill, monarch of the West it delights me to present this completely cornucopious canary this curvacious cadenza in the companion of classical singsong this collation of champagne and columbine this cultivated coloratura from Colorado... words fails me...
Lucille Du Charmes.
Handel's "Rinaldo."
What a shot you are.
My second husband, Count Eggenweiler was a champion trap shooter.
Trap shooting's a different thing no offence to your second...
...deceased...
...husband.
He used a shotgun that sprayed.
A pistol is a more exacting weapon.
Burke, take the lady to my... private viewing chair.
Morning, girls!
What's going on?
I wanna show Bull the Custer act.
Here's you scenario.
About Cleveland. First, he's marrying a society dab at the end of the month.
Second, he's got a Republican congress to contend with.
I think we can give Bull the money.
If he's waiting for Cleveland we've got him for life.
Bring Sitting Bull and Halsey over.
Keep those tempos tight, Bill!
Is the grey alright?
Yeah, she'll dance tomorrow.
Morning, chief.
Halsey if you and the chief would follow me a few, short steps he'll be part of America's family.
If you're gonna watch watch from the other side.
Ah, by the way you can tell the chief we've decided to give him
2 weeks salary as a token of our friendship.
Sitting Bull admires the big grey.
Say hello to Buffalo Bill.
Poor thing is frightened.
That bird can't get out, can it?
No...
We're the only ones who show the red and the white without taking sides.
Hello, Chief.
Which way are your leaves blowing?
Nate, get this thing going.
Down stage!
I see General George Armstrong Custer leads the men of the 7 th cavalry deep into the Injun territory known as "Little Big Horn."
Custer bearing the wounds of a cowardly Sioux ambush.
Suddenly Indians appear led by the fiercest of 'em all
Chief Sitting Bull!
Chief, you got a colored sitting in for you
'cause he's the closest we got on our staff to a real Injun.
Custer knows it's gonna be the fight for his life.
Sitting Bull uses an old Injun ploy.
He hates Custer.
It's gonna be an honorable duel between the two great leaders.
But George gets shot in the back by all the other redskins.
Sitting Bull says the battle did not happen that way.
Sitting Bull was not on the battlefield.
He was making medicine and dreaming.
He saw many horses upside down and blue skeletons floating up to the promised land.
Why's he shooting? Put that down you're gonna hurt somebody.
Sitting Bull thinks you're a great marksman. He can see how you killed so many of his buffaloes.
Someday my hair's gonna be along as Custer's...
...was.
Margaret, I've been thinking about us.
I'm glad, Bill.
The more I think about us the less I think about Sitting Bull.
That ain't good for the Wild West.
I'd never interfere with that.
That little bastard ain't gonna make my life easy.
I can't deal with him and deal with you and be my best with the both.
I'm trying to say it's time for you to go. No, Bill.
And the quicker you go the quicker you can start missing me.
Margaret, go on.
Halsey!
What are you doing here?
Sitting Bull came to tell you what he will do in your show.
The sun ain't hardly up yet.
Sitting Bull's thoughts do not have a schedule.
Let me get myself together.
Go and sit down.
What's going on?
I don't know but keep an eye on him.
I'll go get your uncle.
What's happening?
Get Burke.
Damn Injun caught me with my...
Bull kept everybody up.
Bad Bull!
My father has promised me this land.
Protecting it I have had a hard time.
The rivers flow with the blood of my people.
The wind blows the echoes of lies.
The white man has stolen the truth.
That is a great and classic Indian face.
You'll build the village at Killdear Mountain.
Sitting Bull's people will be working.
Children will be playing.
They're waiting for Colonel McLaren and his soldiers to talk peace.
The unarmed Sioux embrace the soldiers with open arms.
Then McLaren will slaughter every man, woman, child and dog.
He's tolerable.
It'll work.
You could come on after the Indians attack McLaren.
This is what Sitting Bull has chosen to do.
Chief we haven't had a heart to heart and I think it's time.
I've listened to Halsey.
He's got guts, 'cause he did insult me in my own house.
He called me a coward.
Says I murdered women, old men, and children.
And dogs.
Yeah, dogs.
You get what I'm saying?
You have till noon to get outta here!
You're finished! Fired! Through!
How could that little runt treat me like that?
It's harder being a star than an Indian.
Everything on this side
I'm taking with me.
What's this?
How did I ever...?
I'll pack the guns now.
Don't touch my guns!
Uncle Will!
Something awful bad... Annie...
We already know.
She going through with it?
Looks like it. We all spoke to her.
She's standing firm.
I can usually steer her where you want her to go, but not this time.
Why's everything a problem here?
Is it a matter of money?
Money might help.
Come on, Frank.
Money has nothing to do with it.
It's Annie's principles.
What about my principles?
Then let her leave.
Wait a minute. I can't let her go.
She owes me too much.
I'll talk to her, but I won't change my mind about the Injun. Right.
If it comes up, or if it'll help you can tell her I love her.
And you take this.
How would you like this?
Here, take it.
We got problems.
No problem, Bill.
I could expect disrespect from anybody but you.
Why are you in the middle of this?
What did Bull ever do for you?
He wants to show the truth.
Why not accept that just once?
Because I got a better sense of history than that.
Besides, I say what goes on in this show.
Not some Injun runt and his half assed half breed.
You got any whiskey?
Where you want this chair?
If you send Bull back they'll kill him.
That is not my problem.
You can have this.
It'll just about fit you.
The little bastard can stay.
Ladies and gentlemen
I'm Nate Salsbury, and on behalf of my partner, Bill Cody we welcome you to the season's opening show of America's...
Mr. Cody, we're ready for the Grand Parade.
...Buffalo Bill's Wild West!
And what would the Wild West be without brave cowboys?
You're on in 2 minutes.
I heard you the 1st time.
You have to go in the carriage.
Stop nagging.
God, they're gonna make lots of dust.
The brave cowboys now assume protective positions so that you, our guests, can witness the true wildness of the West without bodily risk from nature's fury.
And pursuing the brave and powerful buffalo is our star
America's national hero
Bill Cody... Buffalo Bill!
Yes, he was truly born to entertain.
No ordinary man would ever take credit for acts of bravery and heroism he couldn't have done.
And no ordinary man would realize what huge profits could be made by telling a pack of lies like it was the truth.
No, Bill Cody can only trust his senses.
And when his senses fail him he might see things as they really are.
And now as the trooperies reassemble would you join in the singing of
Buffalo Bill's favorite American song by Francis Scott Key
"Oh Say, Can You See."
It is Buffalo Bill's belief that this could and should be the next national anthem.
Would you please rise.
And now to open our show in a big way we present to you an unparalleled attraction:
The world's foremost woman marksman the little girl of the western plains the fearless Annie Oakley!
Assisted by Frank "the world's most handsome living target" Butler!
Steady.
Tell him to steady the cigar.
Coward.
We love you, Annie.
Move that horse.
For her grand finale, Miss Oakley will attempt a new shot the two for one axe shot.
She will split a bullet with the axe hitting both targets simultaneously.
Take your time, honey.
They'll wait forever.
Please remain as quiet as possible.
The bullet must split and hit the two targets.
Is that possible?
It's never been done before.
Oh, how close!
She missed, but so close!
Give her a hand!
Nate, once again.
Again.
What? Frank, again.
Annie, you don't have to.
We love you anyway.
I can do it, Frank.
Wait, I lost my hat.
You ready?
Stay with us, Lord.
Annie, where you going?
He moved it.
Annie, take a bow.
Frank, what will you do?
I can't do the act myself.
And now, ladies and gentlemen here's a man who can stick to any animal with hair.
Say hello to the King of Cowboys, Buck Taylor!
Alright, the Bull banner.
Is the old man ready?
You're on next.
Halsey tell Bull he's going to discover what show business is all about.
He'll be back here begging me to do the Custer act.
Sitting Bull's going to suffer a worse defeat than Custer ever did.
Custer got to die.
Bull's just going to get humiliated.
The most murderous the most colorful redskin alive...
Here he comes the battling chief of the Hunkpapa Sioux
Sitting Bull!
Morning! You're up.
Listen, I...
I'm really sorry about last night.
It was opening night and we always kick up dust.
I don't like them to drink alone.
I must have been kind of a disappointment.
You look real pretty in that light.
Actually...
I've become a morning man.
There's no pressure.
You see, at night...
And the whiskey we get here isn't good. It dulls the...
Say good morning to the flying Dutchman.
Hi, bird. He's OK in there?
You don't let him out, do you?
What are they doing?
They're just horsing around.
You have to help him.
Stop them. They may hurt him.
Alright.
You just stretch out there.
I'll be right back.
Put him down.
It's like a bull fighting a flea.
Son of a bitch!
There's only squaws over there.
Nate! Burke! Get over here!
Goddamn!
What is it?
Stay behind the tent!
Problems? Take a look up there you'll see the problem.
Sitting Bull's making his exit.
Buck Taylor, get across the river and see what's going on.
Look at that boy go!
Rides like the wind!
The Injuns.
Where?
My God.
Why is it so dark in here?
Hey, son, get down.
Gotcha!
Boys, I want a posse. A tough posse.
We ride in ten minutes.
There's no way to outfox a fox.
We're not taking this lying down.
You horse son of a bitch where are you going?
Damn... damn.
What's wrong?
I got trouble on my hands.
The little cowboy wasn't hurt?
No. The Injuns.
They've escaped.
All of them?
No, just the dangerous ones.
I got to go get them.
How long will you be gone?
As long as it takes.
You know I'd never let anything come between us and our little...
...unless it was something real like this.
Goddammit! Where's my real jacket?
Well the posse's formed.
Knowing that you're laying there waiting for me will serve to stiffen my resolve.
How could you be so clumsy?
You could have harmed him.
I hate birds.
Cody, don't you ever harm my Flying Dutchman.
Ed, where you going?
With you, Uncle Will. Get off.
Your mother would be furious.
Jules, get on the horse.
Where's the Indian who's supposed to be at this gate?
When Bill's dressed for a ride and mounted on his stallion any doubts about his legend are soon forgot.
Yes, Bill's fine physical portrait hides any faults his mind possesses.
But any tracker will tell you if you don't know what you're after you'd best stay home.
There they are, Uncle Will!
Control yourself.
That'll teach Sitting Bull a lesson.
It's a question of law and order.
Sitting Bull was out of order.
Here they come.
Now as they come over the ridge we'll...
Wait a minute.
I don't see Sitting Bull.
No. They're not there. They must be there. Maybe they're in the back.
I don't see Sitting Bull.
I don't see no Injuns.
Maybe they just didn't find them.
Oh, they found them. No Injun ever got away from Uncle Will.
Maybe they're dressed in our clothes.
Alright, up stick. It's them.
But no down stick.
They're not there.
Oh, my God.
I don't see any Indians with them.
'Cause there ain't no Injuns there.
But Bill's the greatest
Indian hunter of them all.
He led fifteen of the best trackers into territory he knows better than the back of his own hand looking for an old man a giant, and five boys.
It's not your fault, Bill.
We made it clear that this is a camp, not a prison.
Nate's right.
We're not in the prison business.
Better tell
McLaughlin that he's gone.
"Sitting Bull escapes after first trying to burn down the arena."
I sure thought you'd catch him.
They weren't that far ahead.
Ed, why don't you go close the gate?
I never saw him refuse a drink before.
I don't care what anyone says.
God bless Buffalo Bill!
God! He shot himself!
Damn bird.
Get out of here. Sit down.
Damn bird!
Well, I hate birds.
Me, too.
Bull and Halsey are out there.
What? How?
They must have tracked us.
Come on in, boys.
Couple of buffs got loose.
We had to chase them down.
Too bad you couldn't join us.
Where were you?
It's the first moon of the month.
Answer the question. Where were you?
During the 1st moon
Sitting Bull visits the sun and the squaws move teepees to the moon's path.
Stop sunning and mooning us and tell us where you've been.
You were up in the mountains? Yes.
Wasn't that a little dangerous?
Sitting Bull knows the mountains.
What if I had sent someone after you?
Sitting Bull was not hiding.
In the mountains, Sitting Bull realized he must do more in your show.
Well, now we're back in business.
Foes in '76, friends in '85.
I don't understand.
Explain that.
Sitting Bull will do the only thing he would want to show his people.
And what is that?
Sitting Bull will make the big grey dance.
Responsibility is a funny thing.
It's different for stars than for ordinary folks.
Please, Buntline, this man's in pain.
That's why stars spend so much time in front of mirrors.
To see if their good looks can overcome their judgment.
Not now, Mr. Buntline, please.
A star like Buffalo Bill Cody makes a judgment it becomes a commitment.
It's got to stick at any cost.
The only way
I could have avoided seeing him on that mountain is if he never went to the mountain.
Now I can understand why he lied to me.
He's got to look good in front of his people, same as I.
But I'm generous and flexible.
That's good, generous and flexible.
Ladies and gentlemen please take the places we have specified for you.
Welcome, braves.
We welcome you with open arms.
Wranglers on the Deadwood coach easy there.
I know the ladies like to be bounced around a bit but it'll blur the picture.
This is a very impressive assemblage.
Now, pay attention.
Nate, would you convey to Buffalo Bill that we are ready?
I'm generous and flexible.
Bill!
I'll be there.
Generous and flexible.
I choose to overlook the entire incident.
100 years from now, this photo will still exist. Remember that.
This is the way people will remember you.
Bill, good morning!
Ladies and gentlemen, Injuns
I didn't know you were ready. Sorry.
Get ready.
Look at the birdy!
Hold it!
I don't want Sitting Bull next to
Annie Oakley.
'Cause I don't want
Sitting Bull next to Annie Oakley.
The fans won't like it.
Put him with the other Indians.
I don't want
Sitting Bull next to Annie.
Um... Halsey...
It'd be a better idea, with the sun factor, if you and the chief moved over with the other Indians.
Sitting Bull will stand by Annie Oakley.
Why don't you just come over here where you should be?
Sitting Bull will move for $25.
I swear he plans these things.
What do you want to do?
Let him stay where he is.
We'll put Halsey's face and hat on Buck Taylor and Sitting Bull's on
Johnny Baker and vice versa.
That way those two Injuns will be with the other Injuns.
And don't show him the photograph.
Buffalo Bill says it was better the first way. Make your photograph.
Everybody hold your breath now!
Hold it a minute. Hey, Dart!
Come here!
Go on, I'm getting my picture took.
Wayne, will you... Dart go find out what that darkey wants.
A wire just came from the President.
This is no time to joke.
It's for real.
It's there. Tell them.
A wire came from the President of the United States.
Who told you?
You can't read either.
You may take the photograph now.
Injuns gear their lives to dreams.
And when he dreams no matter how farfetched it is he'll wait till he dies for it to come true.
White men, they're different.
They only dream when things are going their way.
I'm no expert on the subject but what Bull does is a lot cheaper than mounting a Wild west show which is just dreaming out loud.
"The Honorable William F. Cody."
"Grover Cleveland, President has chosen to make the first stop of his honeymoon ex cursion in Buffalo Bill's
Wild West camp at Fort Ruth.
The scheduled time of arrival is Thursday, October 18th at 8 p. M."
Night!
We've never done a night show.
Uncle Will, it's just like in Sitting Bull's dream.
I bring up this dream business because things are starting to take on an unreal shape.
Just think for a minute.
Sitting Bull...
Put yourself in his place.
You sit in your teepee and you dream.
Then you go to wherever the dream might come true.
And you wait for real life to catch up.
Mr. President, Mrs. Cleveland
...honored guests.
I'm Nate Salsbury.
And I can tell you that Nate Salsbury has never been as proud in his long career as he is tonight to present our very first after dark, request performance and to dedicate it to you our finest American and your fine, new wife.
Ed's in the box.
Burke's up there, too laughing it up with the President while we're stuck down here.
Grover Cleveland.
That bear is a star!
He's bigger than Buck Taylor!
He's bigger than you are.
He's the biggest man I've ever seen.
Meet America's national entertainer the man who IS the Wild West the honorable
William F. Cody
Buffalo Bill!
Mr. President
Mrs. Cleveland distinguished visitors
I want to take this occasion to welcome you to my Wild West.
Most people will tell you that it's the father of the new show business.
And may the sun never set on this great nation unless it comes up again in the morning.
Mr. President our wedding present for you.
Buffalo Bill writes all of his original sayings himself.
All great men do.
Beautiful.
Just like day, darling.
What a shot!
He loves it.
It's freezing, come on!
Not yet.
OK... now!
Isn't that amazing, my dear?
Yes.
You hit him, Annie.
End it.
She got him.
It's part of the act. Everything's OK.
Is this part of the act?
Quick, I'm going to faint.
I'm bleeding to death. Don't run.
I got to get out. I'll fall.
The tomahawk they carry shall rest in the ground and peace and goodwill to the nations abound.
Presenting Chief Sitting Bull.
What's he saying?
I don't know.
I don't understand a word he's saying. Do you?
But I can guess.
He was joking.
He's got a sense of humor.
His way of making the grey mare dance.
To Sitting Bull and his dancing grey.
Or President Cleveland's closest call!
Now everybody remember be polite, be brief and most of all, be yourself.
Remember, it's the President.
This means a lot to the troopers.
It means something to us, too.
How are you?
Did you get hurt today?
No, no, Annie never misses.
Frank, where've you been?
I'm pregnant. What?
Pregnant.
Congratulations, Mrs. Poole.
I sang it at the Teatro del Roma in Rome, you know.
And I sang...
I never seen black eyed peas like this.
You were impeccable.
Thank you.
Here we go. Champagne and refreshments for everyone.
Can Nina sing now?
Oh, yes, my rose petal. Go ahead.
Our distinguished and delightful
First Lady has an announcement.
Quiet, please.
For your entertainment my dear friend
Miss Nina Cavallini will sing...
..."Qui sola vergin rosa" in Italian.
Brava!
You know, that's the nicest invitation I ever got. Irresistible.
What a cultivated lady she is.
I'm always trying to spread culture.
Why don't you stay for a few days?
I'll show you the real Wild West.
I'd love to but my secret life with
General Benjamin is wild enough.
Why are you?
Halsey, why's he here?
Great Father is here in answer to
Chief Sitting Bull's dream.
You weren't invited to this party.
No more Bull!
You go.
That way.
Let them in, Mr. Gordman.
Goodman.
The chief is a wonderful comedian.
Good to see you.
Great Father, Sitting Bull has a very simple thing to ask you.
Mr. Halsey, I remind you that in government, nothing is simple.
This request will satisfy
Sitting Bull's people forever.
Remember that I'm only "Great Father" four years at a time.
And another thing
I face a Republican Congress.
I suggest you deal with your local agent.
We have.
The agents will not help.
Doesn't that indicate your request is impossible?
This request is simple.
He said nothing is simple.
Sitting Bull's request is simple.
Sitting Bull dreamed he would meet the Great Father here.
He hoped the Great Father would honor his request.
I'm sorry
There's nothing I can do.
But you haven't heard
Sitting Bull's request.
But it doesn't make any difference.
It's out of the question.
What a confrontation.
Congratulations, Mr. President.
We've had a delightful day with you.
Mr. President
I now see why you're President.
It's uncanny.
The basic, pioneer perception.
The difference between a President and a chief in a situation like this is a President knows enough to retaliate before it's his turn.
Remember that.
I'll use it at the convention.
Well, Mr. President
I know you're tired and want to hit the hay.
My personal bed is at your disposal.
It's hardly ever been used.
Where will you sleep?
You can sleep with me.
I'll sleep on the prairie under the moon, listening to the lullaby of the coyotes.
You see, I ain't always been a comfortable man.
It's a man like that that made this country what it is.
Hello there, Dart.
Hello, Mr. Cody.
Is your work done, boy?
Yes sir. Everything's spic and span.
That's good. It's a shame the Injuns can't learn from you coloreds.
But then they'd have nothin' to fuss about, and they do like to fuss.
I ain't never thanked you for giving me the opportunity to work for you.
No need. It's part of my upbringing.
I help coloreds when I can.
How's that?
My daddy was killed trying to keep slavery out of Kansas.
Why'd he do that?
My daddy hated slavery so much instead of letting 'em become slaves he fought to keep all coloreds out.
Trying to protect you.
And he caught a knife in his lungs for the trouble.
You want a drink. I'll buy.
You can sit up front with me.
No, sir. It's already late and I ain't got no time for that.
I've got to feed your horse.
Thank you for asking.
Where's the Old Bonded, Crutch?
Hello, Mr. Cody.
Well, I'll be damned!
Buffalo Bill himself.
Buy an old friend a drink?
Another glass.
I was beginning to think you didn't exist.
But here you are in the flesh and what a sight for sore eyes.
You sure passed me by.
Like watching a seed grow into a tree that's too tall to climb.
You got everything you ever wanted.
You even have the President of the US sleeping in your bed.
Let's forget that, Ned and get drunk.
I can't forget it.
Looking at you reminds me of it.
So live it.
Way past the living.
In 100 years they'll be shouting your name.
You're no longer one of the boys.
You're not like ordinary folk.
It gives me goose bumps just being this close to you.
You still got the knack don't you, Ned?
You make it easy, Bill.
You were probably the best ever.
And I'd like to have you back with the show.
But, frankly, Nate can't stand the sight of you.
Nostalgia ain't what it used to be.
You ain't changed, Bill.
I ain't supposed to.
That's why people pay to see me.
Well
This has been a sobering experience.
Damn near a religious awakening.
Buffalo Bill...
What a thrill to have invented you.
What do I owe you for my stay?
Nothing, Mr. Buntline.
You don't owe me nothing.
Thanks, Crutch.
'Cause that's what I got.
Nothing.
I'm off to California to preach against the vultures of Prometheus.
Ned.
See you around.
See you in hell, Bill.
I want to cut the glass blowers.
People really want to see you ride.
When you were in Europe did you say hi to the Queen for me?
Yes, they're still talking about you.
Can't wait for your return.
This'll be our biggest year yet.
We'll gross over 2 million dollars.
I ever tell you I hold the record for a continuous ride on the Pony Express
322 miles in 18 days.
Oh, I know.
Sit down and have a drink.
Too early for me. You look great.
Yeah, well, I feel great.
Like I could go on forever.
Marty, did I ever tell you that I hold the Pony Express record
320 and some odd miles and 18 horses...
Big news.
They've shot Sitting Bull... dead.
I'll be damned.
Oh, my God.
What is it?
Sitting Bull's dead.
McLaughlin's police, at standing rock.
They say he was trying to escape.
He was riding the grey that Bill gave him.
The horse danced when they shot the chief.
Who's going to tell Bill? Nobody.
Mo point bothering him with that.
I don't dream.
Must be somebody out...
I'm not alone.
Oh no, don't buckle.
He ain't really there.
I hate women. I hate them!
Cost me a lot of wampum.
Alright, suit yourself.
You ain't even the right image.
Halsey, get out here.
Tell the chief you've got all the brains. I'll tell him.
Chief!
Halsey's got all the brains.
Ex cept Halsey he doesn't mean a word he says.
Which is why he sounds so real.
Real...
Let me show you something about real.
I was a boy.
I was eleven years...
Nine.
I was nine.
I caught this big buff right smack in the middle.
God meant for me to be white.
God meant for me to be white.
And it ain't easy.
I got people with no lives living through me. Proud people.
People to worry about.
And another thing.
My daddy died without seeing me as... as a star.
Profitable, good looking.
Custer was a star.
He was a good man.
He gave coffee and sugar.
Don't.
He was a good man.
He gave the Indians reason to be famous.
Damn you!
In 100 years...
...I'll still be
Buffalo Bill... star!
And you'll be the Injun.
My God, look at you.
Look at you.
You want to stay the same.
Well, that's going backwards.
Buntline...
Oh, damn you, you deserter.
I'm curious, Chief.
My friends are curious.
My women are curious.
My fans are curious.
And they pay me for it.
I give them what they expect.
You can't live up to what you expect.
That makes you more make believe than me.
You don't even know if you're bluffing.
The difference between a white man and an Injun, in ALL situations is that an Injun is red.
And an Injun is red for a real good reason.
So we can tell us apart.
To tell us apart.
My God ain't he riding that horse right?
If he ain't... then how come all of you took him for a king?
You see
I ain't got nobody to talk to.
Ex cept you.
And you ain't even there.
Carve it.
Yeah, carve it... all of us.
Carve our names.
And celebrate the event.
Ladies and gentlemen.
For the first time in the history of show business, Nate Salsbury and William F. Cody present a conflict between two of the greatest warriors in western civilization staged with spectacular realism.
Behold Chief Sitting Bull warrior of the western plains who has murdered more white men than any other redskin spoiled more white women than any other redskin.
This bloodthirsty leader of the Hunkpapa Sioux has challenged Buffalo Bill to a duel to the death!
Sitting Bull is played by William Halsey.
Buffalo Bill, called "Pahaska" which means "long hair" in Sioux accepts the challenge for his beloved country.
GUARD:
Keep it together.
All right, hold it right there.
Set her down.
Okay, now lift her up and swing her in.
Let's put her to bed.
Let's start driving spikes.
On your feet, Provo.
Move your ass.
Son of a bitch! By God, we did it!
Provo did it!
What about these chains?
Just lay them over the side, cut them.
MAN: Move out of the way, let me in there.
Get the gun.
Don't think like that, Gant.
It isn't smart.
Well, take it.
Shit, you ain't giving that gun to the beaner, are you?
You want it?
Hey, Zach, this time you take Shiraz.
That skinny one.
He's a son of a bitch.
But he's the one who knows the lay of the land.
He's only been in six months...
...brung up around Gila country.
He could be some help to us.
We can get rid of the sheep...
...and we keep the goats.
Well, seven of us left.
PROVO:
That's enough.
Yeah, those other poor dumb bastards probably wind up in Yuma tomorrow.
Yeah, they'll kill them.
Any of you wanna die?
No?
Good.
Come with me, I'll take you to a place where no one can lay their hands on you.
- Who's giving orders?
- You dumb son of a bitch.
I've put up with greasers, all kinds of shitheads in my life.
I never took no orders from no breed.
You don't take orders?
No, not about to.
Then you go.
Now!
Without a gun?
Take his.
You don't like his, huh?
Take mine.
I think you'll leave without a gun.
- Maybe.
- Yes?
Maybe I'll stick a couple of days.
- You, Gant, you wanna leave?
- Not me.
Anybody else?
Good.
I'll tell you one thing now...
...what I think up here...
...I think maybe two, three minutes ahead of you.
And that's what counts.
MAN:
Oh, damn, it's cold. Whoo.
I'll be damned, it's ice.
Yeah, they make it in big blocks like that now.
Keeps this meat from rotting.
LEE RO Y:
We don't get out of here pretty quick...
...we're gonna wish we never saw it.
MENENDEZ: He's damn near frozen.
- Yeah, he's tough as a lizard, though.
You okay, huh?
- Why don't we get out of here?
- Soon enough, my friend.
You know what I'm thinking?
When they locked us up, it was 1897.
My God, that was another century.
- Gila Bend.
- What?
That's where we get off. Gila Bend.
Lee Roy says there's horses there.
- That's right.
- And hacksaws, I hope.
And then what?
Clean up, get some duds and move on.
SHIRAZ:
Where?
- Tucson.
- What the hell for?
So, what the hell's in Tucson?
Samuel Burgade.
- Christ!
- Oh, shit.
Sam Burgade.
Why didn't you send for me?
Well, captain, I thought about it.
Maybe you should've thought about it a little harder, sheriff.
Well, maybe.
When's the last time you spent a day in the saddle?
You think I forgot how to ride a damn horse?
I didn't say that, now, but when?
Uh, that statehood rally a year ago.
I remember that.
That was about the day before you put yourself out to pasture, wasn't it?
That's right. I put myself, just like I put you in that chair.
Now, sheriff, I know I'm retired from the territorial police...
...but goddamn it, you tell me who's with him!
This come in about 6:00. Ahem.
That's 22 escaped, they've captured or killed...
...15 of them, so that leaves seven.
Yes.
Weed.
Yeah, he could track a duck across a pond.
Shiraz, the knife.
Lee Roy Tucker. That coyote sniffed under every boulder in the territory.
Mike Shelby, 19 years old, in for life.
Menendez.
That must be Cesar Menendez.
Real handsome-looking man.
Cut the head off a little gal in Nogales one time.
Said he wanted her earrings.
And Zach Provo.
I thought he was dead.
Well, he will be soon enough.
You know, they got a pretty good bunch of boys over there in Yuma.
Pretty good?
For Zach Provo, that ain't good enough.
You don't know him.
He was a little before your time.
A half-breed.
Meanest Injun I ever saw.
Ten years I chased him up and down the territory.
First time I tried to take him, he plumb outdrew me...
...and left me for dead with a gut shot.
I never knew a man could be so fast.
Last time, though, he wasn't fast enough.
Caught him clean.
- You should have killed him.
- Christ knows I tried.
Well, don't you worry about it, Sam.
We'll get him.
Hell, we've got automobiles, telegraphs, railroads.
I ain't heard anybody outrun a telephone yet.
The Army tells me next year, gonna have some of them flying machines, Sam.
Flying machines?
No, you said it just now, the railroads.
Zach Provo caught himself a ride out of Yuma.
Yeah, I'm way ahead of you on that one, Sam.
We're checking on every car in every train. They got dogs.
Oh, he's in the water.
He was anyway.
Yeah. Let's see, the Gila...
That's too low this time of year.
The Colorado, but the current's too strong to go north.
No...
...he drifted down the Gila into Yuma and caught a train.
First train from Yuma's due in...
You got about 15 minutes to make it.
Fifteen minutes.
Get up! Get that new fire engine.
And get every deputy you can find.
- You coming, captain?
- Yeah, I believe I will.
Do you think the rest of them stuck to Provo?
With only two guns, they got no other choice.
My guess is he handpicked them.
What for?
Me.
You got authority to do this?
I'm Noel Nye,
Sheriff of Pima County.
Well, I'm behind schedule.
I'll give you 10 minutes.
You'll give us what time we need.
Sam Burgade.
Lord God, captain,
I thought you was dead.
Well, I ain't dead. I'm retired.
CLEM: Sheriff?
- Yo!
JETFORE:
Do you reckon they're in there?
We ain't heard nothing from inside.
You won't, neither.
SAM:
They already jumped.
Smell it.
- That's gun oil.
- They're headed this way.
When they cleared Yuma, they threw out the ice.
Them was big blocks, take time to melt...
...even as late as tomorrow morning the ground would still be damp.
We need to know where that is.
- That's as far west as we need to look.
- All right.
Buck, listen.
Now, you get on that telegraph...
...you alert every town from here to Yuma, understand?
- Yeah.
- You have them find that ice.
- Go on.
- Okay.
Buck, tell them that
Sam Burgade wants to know.
And tell them murdering...
Tell them them boys was on the train.
They was on. Boys, come here.
MENENDEZ:
Nothing.
Nothing out there.
- Are you sure that redneck knows?
- I knows.
A corral full of fresh horseshit means there's horses.
That means men gotta be riding them.
Nothing comes easy.
Well, when and if we get the horses, what then?
We stick together.
I'll get us a stake.
All right, we stick together.
Nobody wants to get his ass blowed off on a horse, riding lonesome.
But we gotta take your word for it on the stake.
LEE RO Y: Are you giving it?
- Yes.
Provo, here they come.
We're lucky. Only one man.
RIDER:
Whoa! Whoa!
A man needs two things in this world:
A good horse and a silver dollar.
NYE:
Thanks, Jim.
All right, Noel, what's their next move?
Well, by the way they outfitted, they can go any direction they like.
No, you gotta think like them, not like you.
What about that gold he stole off of Santa Fe?
The gold you couldn't find.
It's buried up north somewhere in Navajo country.
It won't do him no good down here.
Well, he's gonna need more than a cash box in a general store.
Yeah, now you're talking.
You mean bait?
That special shipment from the Denver Mint's...
...due in here Friday, isn't it?
NYE: What the hell's wrong with you?
You trying to tell everybody in town?
You got a better idea?
If you leave him, he'll talk.
Kill him, they know we've been here for sure. Now, move it!
Man finds that chili belly gonna think twice before he comes after me.
Eye for an eye.
Well, hell's fire.
The line's gone dead.
Lightning, I guess.
Maybe so.
NYE:
Let's see what we got.
"Ice thrown from train mile past south fork...
...Wellton junction.
At dawn, we'll..."
Well, we got most of it.
- Much obliged, Bo.
- Anytime.
Yeah, Bo.
Mind my horning in, Noel?
No. No, Sam.
You tell me, now.
No, Zach Provo's yours.
You can have him.
Funny thing.
I quit the law...
...because I thought it was over.
What I knew how to do.
Too much was changing.
Modern times.
I liked the world the way it was.
Now it's coming back.
Running back.
Looks like Zach Provo's made it my time again.
Your supper's on the stove.
You know, if you was to get married to that Hal fella...
...you wouldn't have to cook supper for me no more.
I'd have to cook supper for him anyway, so, what's the difference?
And what makes you think
I wanna get married?
You mean to tell me I'm gonna be stuck with you for the rest of my life?
I try to imagine how it would be.
And as you know...
Well, Hal isn't exactly...
Like your daddy?
I remember Mama telling me that when you'd walk into a saloon...
...men would jump out of windows to get out of your way.
Your mama dearly loved to hear them
Wild West stories about me.
Tallest man in the territory.
Oh, no more. That's all finished.
Things are changing.
Look out the window.
Time was, you could see clear to the end of the world.
No more. Time's changing.
Some days you wonder where it all went.
It's true, then?
I heard.
Are you going to get into it?
- I am into it.
- You retired.
This is just a loose end.
No, it isn't.
- Do you have to go?
- Yes.
Why?
Because I never knew how to do anything else. Look...
Honey, there's a man coming for me.
I can't just sit there on the couch and then wait for him.
Well, who? What kind of man?
Oh, a fellow named Provo
I put in Yuma prison a long time ago.
He's half Injun, all killer.
He wants to kill you. Why?
I reckon he's always been more than happy to kill any man wearing a badge.
But I gave him cause to remember me.
Hey, what about my supper?
I'm not a little girl anymore.
Tell me.
Well, it was his last job.
Blew up a Santa Fe express train, blew up four guards along with it.
We tracked him for four weeks.
Found him, finally, holed up in a hogan down Salinas Springs way.
We had to shoot the hell out of the place.
I was the first one in.
Kicked through the doors, still shooting.
He was all finished.
Lying there, bad shot, looking up at me.
There was his woman.
Young Navajo girl.
- I still don't understand.
- She was dead.
- Killed in the shootout.
- Why didn't you ever tell me?
Well, it sure wasn't nothing to brag about.
You killed her?
Maybe.
No way to tell.
Provo surely thought so.
You can't blame him for that.
Does he have a chance?
I reckon he's the only man that does.
(DOGS BARKING
THEN KNOCK ON DOOR)
MAN:
Susan?
Sorry I'm late.
- Good evening, sir.
SAM: Ahem.
Well, you be sure to take your shawl, now.
It's cold down by the river.
- Oh, Sam.
- I've been down there.
- You'll be here when I come home?
- Yeah, I'll be here.
Go on, now.
Brickman.
- Sir?
- It's always nice to see you.
You're welcome any time.
Well, thank you very much, sir.
What was all that...
..."always nice to see you" supposed to mean?
He never said anything like that before.
He's in a strange mood.
He's going back to work.
Got it.
Someday, we'll compare scars.
Let her be, Gant.
Let me see what you got, honey.
Come on, now.
- She's carrying.
LEE RO Y: Who gives a damn?
What you gotta do with greasers is teach them who's boss...
...before they're born, as after.
Leave her be.
There's some things a man's gotta have, Provo.
You tell me about it.
What's that?
Provo, hey, it's just the telephone!
Now.
Shelby?
I never thought you'd ever grudge a man a little fun, Provo.
It's not the time for that.
You're looking at a man who's been
11 years without a woman.
PROVO:
I'll get you all you can handle later.
Well, shit, you calling that Mexican pig a woman?
I think it's time.
PROVO:
Lee Roy?
Listen, I wanna thank you about bringing us here.
We should talk about where we're going next.
Well, anything you need, you just ask old Lee Roy.
Ha, ha. Lookit here.
Look, here's our stake.
The gold shipment's gonna arrive in Tucson Friday from the Denver Mint...
That's good.
Lee Roy's getting off here.
What's it say, kid?
It's new money, though.
- Here, you read it.
- Hey, dumb kid. Don't be stupid.
He can't read any Spanish.
It's not Spanish. Look, it's right there.
I'll translate.
"Gold shipment.
The shipment will be well protected under supervision...
...of the former captain of territorial police, Samuel Burgade."
Well, I'll be damned.
Provo, this is a trap.
A lot of trouble.
What?
He makes a hell of a lot of trouble,
I don't...
I don't think we should disappoint him.
- This is a trap.
- Yes.
For somebody.
Gus Stanton, you talk like a plain damn fool.
I'm gonna be sitting up on the truck.
What you think this is all about?
I'll tell you what.
It's about you getting yourself dead.
Now, wait a minute.
Wait just one minute.
Nobody said anything was gonna happen.
As president of this bank, if we could lose that shipment...
- Oh, shut up, Gus.
SAM: Now, you listen.
If we don't do it exactly the way we put it in the paper, Provo won't bite.
He'll back off and fade away.
I gotta be out there where he can see me.
Here. What about right up here?
He can see you real good.
Get a good shot if you're sitting there, Sam.
Let's get on down to the depot.
Crank it up, go on.
SHELBY: There she is.
- Guards and all.
SAM: What the hell are all these people doing here?
NYE:
You put it in the newspaper.
Push them back. Clear them out.
We can't have these kids in the way if Provo tries to take that box.
All right. Go home, ladies.
Go on back, now.
- Let's get this thing out of here.
- He's cranking it, captain.
NYE: Go home.
- Damn Fourth of July parade.
Yeah, I know.
Get them children inside. Go on.
Get them kids off the street.
Get back, go on.
Get off the street, go on.
It's not gonna work, is it?
Lt'll work all right.
- Miss Burgade?
- Yes?
- Your father...
- What's the matter?
Is anything wrong?
He's afraid for you.
See, there's a lot of bad people in town, wants me to look after you.
And who are you?
I don't even know you.
Oh, I know you, though.
For a long time.
Now, you give me any more goddamn trouble, I'll cut you.
I'll cut you in a hundred places.
In the eyes and the throat.
You won't see or talk again.
You won't be pretty no more.
You know who I am?
My father will kill you.
He will try.
And that's all I need.
Now get up.
Get some riding clothes on.
Get some riding clothes on.
Take that dress off.
- Take that dress off!
- Aah!
PROVO:
Now, get out of that dress.
Can you write?
- I asked you if you can write.
- Yes, you bastard, I can write.
- Well, we made it.
- Seems like it.
You sure Provo ain't smarter than you give him credit for, Sam?
He ain't here, Sam.
God knows where he is, but he ain't here.
What's the matter, Sam?
Oh, Jesus.
Damn. Blind.
Stupid.
NYE:
I know it's rough on you, captain.
We all appreciate what you're going through.
I don't believe it'll be long...
...before we find out which direction they took her.
We're gonna contact the proper authorities down the line.
We'll cut them off and bottle them up, and we'll get Susan back.
SAM: All without getting up from behind that desk, Noel?
You're not gonna trip up the likes of Zach Provo...
...with a big-city telephone wire.
He is on horseback.
To get him, you're gonna have to get on a horse and track him.
The longer you sit talking about it, the farther he's gonna get.
What's wrong with calling the governor...
...and requesting help from the Army?
Surround this Provo with 1000 troops.
He'd slip through them at night and be long gone...
...while you're still trying to figure out how he did it.
You think he's just some raggedy-ass half-breed, don't you?
Well, I have to tell you he beat me here, on my own ground.
Go on, send a telegram to Phoenix.
Try it.
I'll bet you $ 100 he's already cut the wire.
Hello, Millie? This is Noel. Noel!
I want you to get through to Bo Simpson, depot.
I'm gonna try to get a line to Phoenix.
Yeah, I'll wait. I'll wait.
I'll tell you where Provo's headed.
He's northbound.
I'm pretty sure where to.
You all do what you want.
I'm gonna get myself provisioned and get in his track...
...and I'm gonna stay there till I get my daughter back.
And then I'm gonna kill him and every son of a bitch with him.
I've got no authority no more to call out a posse...
...but I'd be obliged for company.
Yeah.
Yeah, Bo.
I do indeed.
Well, that line to Phoenix cut out about 40 minutes ago.
Been a long time since you go on trail, captain.
That's right, amigo.
Sam.
- I'm obliged to you.
- That's all right, Sam.
I sent two boys up ahead, scout the flanks of Catalinas.
We might get lucky.
What do you figure?
They got four, five hours on us?
SAM: What are you doing here?
- I'm going with you.
We got no place for greenhorns this trip.
You're gonna have to kill me.
That's the only way you'll stop me.
CLEM: Captain, one of them horses had a tiebar shoe.
- More than likely to hold a soft hoof.
- They went on up the canyon, all right.
They ain't making pains about covering up their tracks.
I told you they wouldn't.
Is Burgade with them?
You don't need to look to know that.
Having second thoughts?
A man who has to think twice ain't no man.
PROVO: How do they look?
- Lf we don't ride them too hard...
Ride them too hard?
Well, we're gonna have to.
GANT:
Who has to?
By God, I ain't moving another foot.
What the hell's going on here?
You got us up here on your say-so, and what've we got for it?
Nothing.
Nothing except that posse down there and this little girl.
And she don't look like no stake to me.
SHIRAZ: That's right.
We keep her and they come kill us.
When lead starts slapping these rocks here...
...you figure we're all gonna hide behind that juicy little butt of hers?
That man that's chasing us down there...
...is the man I owe.
And I need your help to pay off that debt.
We ain't interested.
You interested in $48,000 in Santa Fe Express Gold Eagles?
- What?
- I buried them 11 years ago.
Some of it's down by Castle Butte.
The rest of it's up high on a rim near Deadskin Rock.
Is that an offer you're making to us?
Four thousand dollars apiece, that's my offer.
You interested, Shiraz?
Sounds pretty good to me.
Weed?
WEED: Can I trust you?
PROVO: Yes.
I believe I can.
- Shelby?
- You don't have to ask me, Provo.
Gant?
Now, hold on. What about him?
He knowed.
He knowed all along, didn't he?
You in or out?
Christ, man, for $4000 in gold, I'd cut my old man in the town square...
...and let the vultures feed on his carcass.
I'm in, I'm in.
But let me tell you just one more thing.
Around a little woman like that, you just remember...
...we ain't in Sunday school.
Hey, kid, you take care of her tonight, huh?
Just remember, Shelby, he didn't give her to you.
She belongs to all of us.
Ain't that right, missy?
Hyah! Hyah!
Provo!
PROVO:
Get her back up on the trail.
Hey, Provo,
I was just gonna sleep...
You know, I was gonna sleep there for a minute.
SHELBY:
Oh! What's wrong? Stop it!
Oh, Provo, I'm sorry!
DUTCH:
Well, if it ain't Sam Burgade.
How are you, captain?
My God, Dutch, how are you?
Well, could be worse.
Provo?
Provo.
No, thank you, Dutch.
Son of a bitch came riding through here.
Took my best horses.
Ran the rest of them off.
The boys are out there now trying to rustle them back.
They had a girl with them.
Yeah, pretty little filly.
- Was she all right?
- I'd say so.
When those boys looked at her, she looked back at them.
You know what I mean?
Do you know her?
She's my daughter, Dutch.
Oh, Christ.
- Which way they heading?
- Uh, northeast.
SAM:
Oh, they'll stick with him now.
He'll buy them off with that Santa Fe gold...
...and take them into the reservation.
Just act friendly, keep smiling.
Keep your hands away from your guns.
What if they try to hold us?
They don't know how.
(PROVO SPEAKING
IN INDIAN DIALECT)
He says there's a spring...
...over there across the wash.
Take them over there and make camp, then you come back.
And Gant...
...you keep those pants buttoned.
- Shelby?
- Yeah?
You keep your eye on that girl.
Yeah, I will.
Provo is taking his time.
He'll make out all right.
- He's one of them, ain't he?
- He is, but we ain't.
Hey, Mike, uh...
...what say we climb in that little saddle there, huh?
Provo said no.
Oh, but, uh, Provo ain't here.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
But I am.
You ever see anything as wet behind the ears as that?
Oh, ho, ho.
Now, you sure you know how to use that thing, kid?
Yeah, pull this little thing right here.
Ah. Well, you just...
Just relax a little bit.
GANT:
Oh, you little Judas.
You son of a bitch!
- What are you laughing at?
- He shot you in the ear.
You son of a bitch, you!
Did you hear the shot?
Did you hear it?
Look at that! Kid shot him in the ear! Look at him.
Thank you.
PROVO:
There it is.
We take your gold.
But we do this only because you blood brother.
Burgade. Burgade.
Burgade.
NYE:
All we want is the girl.
We'll make no arrests.
Take no prisoners.
We just get the girl and leave the reservation.
Ahem. I don't think you understand.
That girl is his daughter.
We know.
NYE: We ain't about to change their minds.
I'm a sworn officer of the law.
As a sworn officer of the law,
I got no authority...
...to go on the reservation and hunt down Provo. My hands are tied.
Now, it gravels on me, captain...
...I can't help you out, but that's the way it goes.
I'll ask you to come back with us.
Well, like you say, you got no authority on this land.
You go on back if you have to.
I'll go where I have to.
I know where you're going, six feet under.
That's where you're going.
They got seven guns to your one.
Everybody's gotta die, nobody's gotta give up.
Look at you.
You can't even get on a horse.
You ain't been out three days, you can't even ride.
That is, by God, enough!
If I don't keep after him, he's got no more use for Susan.
He'll turn his dogs loose on her.
He don't care nothing for her, he wants me.
If I can't do nothing else,
I can offer him some kind of a trade.
Now mount up!
I'll ride with you till we get out of sight.
Then I'll cut north and pick up his trail.
I'm coming with you.
Be damned if you are.
I wasn't asking your permission.
We best step down, let the horses blow.
The deeper we get into this reservation...
...the rougher it gets.
It's nothing like Massachusetts.
Planning to stay here in the territory?
Yes, sir.
- What kind of work do you do?
- Hydroponics.
It's a special kind of agriculture.
Grow crops in sand.
Use chemicals for fertilizer.
We use horse manure.
You know, you ought to let your hair grow.
Keep your head warm in the winter, sun off your neck in the summer.
Short hair ain't right for a man.
What about that there pistol?
You know how to use it?
Yes, sir.
I was once pretty good with it.
Targets, anyway.
- Never shot at a man?
- Never had cause to.
I guess there is a difference.
Man is generally a little bigger.
Those are horseshoe tracks.
It's them.
These mountains run about 30 miles into deep gorge country...
...the Grand Canyon.
Provo won't put his back to that.
He's gotta keep going northeast till he makes a stand.
Or an ambush.
We'll wait a spell.
- What for?
- Sundown.
Sign's hard to read in the rocks...
...but they headed up that dry streambed.
They could double back and set up a trap.
I don't see much point in walking into it.
They're not far.
Maybe two, three miles.
When we don't show,
Provo will send someone back...
...to look for us.
Why don't we go fishing?
How's that?
That'll do. Yeah, that will do fine.
Well, we best get on up the hill.
Oh!
Don't never cock a rifle...
...till you're ready to use it.
Best to leave this here, anyway.
In plain sight.
Are you sure...?
Are you sure someone's coming?
Provo has gotta get worried.
He might even think we're lost.
He'll send out a stalking horse.
Send a what?
A man, to show himself.
Someone we're sure to recognize...
...to put us on the trail.
It's an old trick.
You uh...
You told the sheriff you're gonna try and trade your life for Susan's.
Did I?
Provo is not a man about to bargain.
Not when he's got all the chips.
No, he wants only one thing.
Me, alive.
Then he'll find some mean way to kill me.
He'll take his time...
...because it will come on him...
...that killing me is gonna leave a great big hole in his life...
...where his hate was.
I don't reckon the man's got anything else to live for.
Yeah, that's my ace in the hole.
I want to kill him...
...but he wants to kill me slow.
That's it.
Comes to a showdown, he'll hesitate...
...and that's when I'll get him.
Weed.
You move an ear, you're a dead man.
- Put that gun away.
- I'm just trying...
I don't want you shooting me.
Pull his boots off.
Come on, hurry it up.
You're losing your touch, George.
What you gonna do with me, Burgade?
Maybe cut you up a little.
Let you bleed to death, maybe.
- You tell me what I want to know.
- And if I do?
Then I'll tie you to the tree and leave you there...
...till I finish my business up the mountain.
- Then I'll come back to you.
- That's mighty white of you.
Choose between you killing me and the law hanging me?
- You gotta do better than that.
- Do I, George?
Do I, you son of a bitch?
Where are they? Where's my girl?
- For Christ's sake.
- Come on, you bastard!
What about if Weed fell off a cliff last night...
...and busted his stupid neck?
If he fell off a cliff,
Burgade pushed him.
Now he knows where we're at.
He's out there someplace looking at us right now.
I'll show you.
Get up.
Get up, goddamn it!
I don't say it twice.
He's down there.
Why don't you wave to him?
Go on, wave to him.
- Wave to him!
- You're insane!
No.
No.
I'm dead.
Dead.
The only thing that kept me alive all those years...
...and at Yuma...
...was knowing I'd be standing here with you one day.
I planned it.
Argh!
I planned it right down to the blue sky.
Samuel Burgade.
Burgade!
Everybody who came to that Yuma prison, I'd ask:
"What about Sam Burgade?"
I found out what he was doing...
...where he lived, and you.
Even that school you went to back in Virginia.
And all the men you was going with.
I knew you'd be home on Fridays doing the wash for him.
- There it is.
There it is.
You see it?!
Yeah, in the trees, a flash.
Lens of his glass.
- Got a seat right in the front row.
- Oh, no, don't touch me!
I know what you're gonna do.
Not me.
What they're gonna do.
No! Please don't hurt me, please!
You, up there!
All of you, down here!
Run, run, run!
Take her, she's yours.
- You serious?
PROVO: Try me.
SHELBY: No!
- Shiraz, come on.
What do you wanna cause her trouble for, huh?
- She never hurt you.
- I don't wanna hurt you, kid!
- Now move!
- What about yesterday...
...when you didn't want anybody to touch her?
She would've screamed yesterday.
I want her to scream today.
You don't die for women.
You kill for them.
- Run! Run! Run!
- Get her!
- Wahoo! Damn.
No, don't do it!
Oh, those murdering bastards.
HAL:
No, it's what they want.
Stop!
No!
Stop!
No!
No!
Oh, no!
Hold her damn feet!
She nicked you!
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Burgade!
Burgade!
Burgade!
Burgade!
I don't wanna hit you again.
PROVO:
They're fucking your daughter!
- Let me shoot.
- What about Susan?
I'll get closer. I won't miss.
For the love of God.
He didn't come.
He should've.
He will.
If he doesn't come for her by sunrise, string her up to this tree.
And when he sees her jerking on them ropes, he'll come.
- He'll come.
- What if he don't?
He will.
Remember in the prison, I told you:
Him thinking of himself all the time...
...as being one of the Lord's own angels?
If he stays down there and lets her die...
...it will be all over anyway.
Before the week is out, he'll stick a gun in his mouth and pull the trigger.
- Are you all right?
- L...
I don't know.
Susan.
She's lying where they left her.
- Is she...?
- She's got some clothes on.
I saw her move.
Maybe she's not hurt too badly.
- Not hurt?
- She's alive.
That's what it comes down to, isn't it?
If she can survive it, we sure as hell can.
I guess maybe you're some tougher than I figured you for.
Yeah.
- They don't seem to be moving out.
Half-moon comes up about 10:00.
Won't be bad light for shooting.
How can we do that with Susan up there?
We've gotta take the chance.
If she stays with them, she's dead.
MENENDEZ:
Shut up.
- And Provo?
- He's still down there.
Sitting and waiting.
As soon as she's burning good, get going.
Hey, they're burning us out!
They're burning us out!
The fire, it's coming up the mountain.
MENENDEZ: Shiraz, get the horses.
Gant, get the other blanket.
SHELBY:
I'll get the girl.
Menendez!
No, not that way.
The horses are down here.
Not today, amigo.
He's coming.
The son of a bitch is coming.
Shelby.
Run, Susie!
- Get away from her, kid.
Run, Susie! Run to the right!
Get away from her, kid.
Come on, the blankets.
Aargh!
All right, you pig.
I lost the damn bastard in the rocks.
SHELBY: He's gonna chase us all the way to Canada.
Nobody can chase you if you don't run, kid.
Listen, amigo. You go down there behind those rocks. I'll stay up here.
We'll catch him in a crossfire when he comes up, huh?
There he is.
Why didn't you shoot him?
I can almost see that gold from here.
Listen, kid, see that rock over there?
Look. See that rock?
At the base of that rock is an old oak tree.
Fifty paces north is where all that gold's buried.
Now, you take your girl...
...and go down on the back side of this hill...
...in them rocks, and you wait.
Think about all that gold.
Now move, go on.
If you'd come over that ridge five minutes ago...
...you would be a dead man.
Down below,
I saw the ones you killed.
There's only two of them left.
Provo and the kid, up there with Susan.
That's Menendez.
- You got it straight now?
- Yes, sir.
Well, I think I ought to be the one to go up there.
Appreciate the offer.
But this is the way
I used to make my living.
Give me 15...
Better make it 20 minutes.
It's a mighty rough hill.
Remember, three shots, then get that horse going.
SUSAN:
Stop shooting!
Susan.
Captain.
This is gonna take a long time.
Drop it.
Drop it.
No!
Aahh! Stop it!
- Aahh!
- Ugh!
Not yet.
Not yet.
Now.
I take your heart.
Susie.
Help me. Please.
Susie.

- Burn him.
- Hot iron.
Pull him.
O'Hanlan.
I'll take the iron.
Old man gave me this to bring to you.
He said to tell you, you are the first man that got a letter for a long time.
He's very proud of you.
- Who's it from, John?
- A lawyer. Says on the outside.
- Reckon you're in some kind of trouble?
- I don't know.
I don't know, Harley.
Sure has followed me all over Texas.
All right, you chuckwallers, come and bury it!
Lookie here.
Look, that spread we worked out of Del Rio last fall.
You remember that spread, don't you, Harley?
Seems I recollect that's where I didn't have a good hold on the jerk line.
Yeah, that's right.
You sure was hell with the hide off down there in Del Rio, Harley.
I told you before, though, John, I never knowed she was the headman's daughter.
Ain't you gonna open it?
I'm not opening any letter from a lawyer on an empty stomach.
I've eaten a lot of good food in my life, but this weren't part of it.
I heard no complaints from none of the others.
Yeah, well, they ain't as well-bred as I am.
All them crumb-castle belly cheaters are the same.
You name it, and they'll ruin it.
Seems all a man has to do to call himself a cook is not know anything about it.
It's all part of the same thing.
Sure ain't no life for a man who appreciates the finer things.
Every year, I tell myself I'll look for something easier...
...and every spring, I'm right back at the same old cutting and tying.
I remember when I was about
12 years old, my daddy asked me...
...he says, "What do you wanna be when you grow up?"
A damn fool, I said, "A cowboy."
Been making wrong moves ever since.
If I ever get to be a daddy,
I'm gonna tell the little runt...
- Hey, where you going?
- Cheyenne.
Cheyenne? Ain't you gonna give notice you're quitting?
I did that when I signed on.
You know, John,
I think maybe next Christmas...
...I’ll ride on over to Arkansas and see my sister.
She's two years younger than me.
Up and married a Breedlaw.
Sam Breedlaw.
He's a chamber pot and pin drummer.
Used to sell horses till one of them stepped on him.
Sam Breedlaw's brother Lucius taught me how to make Indian whiskey.
- You know how to make Indian whiskey?
- No, Harley.
Well, take a barrel of Missouri river water, a couple of gallons of alcohol...
...add some strychnine to make them crazy and tobacco to make them sick.
The Indian wouldn't figure it was whiskey unless it made him sick.
Add a few bars of soap to put a head on it.
Half a pound or so of red pepper to give it a kick.
Put some tumbleweed in, boil it till it turns brown.
That's Indian whiskey.
Did I ever tell you how my uncle Charlie got stove up?
- No, Harley.
- His home sat right out in the prairie.
One day, he went into the outhouse and got caught in the middle of a stampede.
When he went in, he said there wasn't a cow in sight.
A few minutes later,
365 longhorns ran over him.
Broke him up something terrible.
That was 19 years ago, and he's still constipated.
Then there was my cousin Jim.
Sure was a fine figure of man...
...but he went all to pieces when he got married.
Got fat, his hair started falling out, teeth went bad.
Worse looking he got,
Better looking she got.
I mean, she weren't no vampire or nothing like that.
Leastways nobody can prove it.
But Lord have mercy...
...the worse looking he got, the better looking she got...
...till there wasn't nothing much left of him...
...and she went off back east somewheres and took up with a stone mason.
I remember one winter it was almost as cold as this, down south of Arkansas.
Got to be so cold down there that winter...
...just about every female in the county come up pregnant in the spring.
All the following summer and fall...
...the men and boys was praying for another cold winter.
"Better than feeding the stock," some said.
I was riding in with an old boy named Hank Jamison.
Had 14 brothers and sisters.
She only had three toes on her left foot.
- I remember one day...
- Harley.
Who only had three toes on her left foot?
Hank's sister, Cora Bea.
Cora Bea Jamison was her name.
Folks used to pay her to take her shoe off.
Married a Styles from over in Hodge County.
They went around trying to find a woman with something wrong with her...
...and if they could, they'd marry her.
Take Helen. She had flame-red hair, pitch-black eyes, ruby lips and no teeth.
But talk about a body.
She could straddle two horses at the same time.
And I went with her until I found out she dipped snuff.
Something awful unfemale about a snuff-dipper, don't you think so, John?
There was always a kind of a crowd around the Jamisons' house...
...waiting for Cora Bea to come out.
She's Hank Jamison's sister.
She only got three toes on her left foot.
Harley, I'd like to talk to you, if you got a minute.
Sure, John.
You've told me that story about twice now.
Once last week, and then once before when we were about 500 miles south of here.
Do you know where we are now,
Harley?
- Not exactly.
- We're in Wyoming Territory.
I wouldn't mention it, but you've been talking all the way from Texas.
- I've just been keeping you company, John.
- I appreciate it, Harley.
And I don't mind it too much for the first 100 miles.
But, Harley, you've been talking for 1000 miles.
I'm sorry, John.
You should have told me.
How many more days you figure to Cheyenne?
Two, maybe three.
If I was you, I'd be a mite more anxious to get there.
Nobody never left me nothing in his will.
Well, I just can't figure it out, Harley.
I don't like to say this about my own brother...
...but he just never was what you'd call an outstanding citizen.
Truth is, he... Well, he...
He wasn't worth the sweat on a water bag, that's what he wasn't.
He'd do anything for money.
Where was it he got killed?
It was someplace in Carolina.
After they burned Georgia.
And that's another thing.
The only reason I can figure he went in the war is he saw a profit in it.
What kind of business you figure your brother left you?
Well, the letter don't say.
But that's just like a lawyer.
They don't tell you no more than it takes to confuse you.
But it's...
...something called the Cheyenne Social Club.
It must be a saloon.
"Jedediah W. Willowby"
- Who's that?
- The lawyer.
You know, Harley...
...I kind of always wondered...
...what it would be like to be a man of property.
Now step right up, folks...
Lookie there.
St. Louis and New Orleans.
You've heard about it.
You've read about it up for years.
You've looked forward to it.
The ancient remedy from Ireland.
The formula of which I smuggled into this country at great personal risk to myself.
And now, for the first time in Cheyenne...
...Dr. Foy's Blue Nectar.
It cures warts, opens the bowels, prolongs life.
Now, don't smile, mister.
I have here today the living proof of what I tell you.
Mr. C.Y. Yancey.
At the tender age of 8, Yancey contracted the most horrible and incurable disease...
...the name of which I can't mention to Christian people.
He began taking this potent elixir.
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
...Mr. Yancey is 111 years old...
...thanks to the preservative and the health-rendering powers of Blue Nectar.
All right, Harley, let's go.
The good people of New Orleans stood in line in the rain...
...for the rare opportunity of paying $ 1...
...for a bottle of this miracle medicine.
Today, I'm going to let it go for 50 cents.
Fifty cents a bottle, or $3 a case.
Here it is, Harley.
- Are you Jedediah W. Willowby?
- No.
I'm Mr. Willowby's assistant.
Can I help you?
- No, I wanna see...
- I'll handle it, Potter.
Yes?
Are you Mr. Jedediah W. Willowby, the lawyer?
- Yes.
- Well...
...I got this letter from you, and here I am.
- You're John O'Hanlan?
- D.J. O'Hanlan was my brother. Yes, sir.
Well, how is it you're on...?
How is it you're only now coming?
I wrote this letter over two years ago.
Well, I'm not too easy to find,
Mr. Willowby.
Took it that long to catch up with me.
Come in. I'm certainly relieved you're finally here.
Have a seat, Mr. O'Hanlan.
These are the accounts I've kept since your brother's unfortunate demise.
- Since he was killed, you mean.
- Yes.
Each month, I've taken my fee out of the business proceeds.
Reluctantly, I might add, because, frankly, it's not in my line.
What kind of business does it do,
Mr. Willowby?
- It turns a dollar or two.
- No, I mean...
Since I've handled the account, the profits to this date come to $ 1110.05.
- That's mine?
- This is just a statement...
...to show that the account was turned over to you in order.
Would you sign at the bottom, please?
Well, you're now the sole owner and proprietor...
...of the Cheyenne Social Club,
Mr. O'Hanlan.
Well, where is it?
Potter, would you take Mr. O'Hanlan out to the Cheyenne Social Club?
Mr. Willowby,
I'd like to get cleaned up a little...
...before I take over my brother's business.
You know how it would look to folks who come in...
Yes, I see what you mean.
One thousand one hundred and ten dollars and five cents.
I must have misjudged my brother.
Harley, this is more money than I ever...
Do you know what I can do with this much money?
We passed some nice-looking saloons.
Harley, with this much money, I can...
I can...
I can... What would you do?
If I had that much money and had a business...
...I guess I'd just live high on the hog for as long as it lasted.
That's not what a shrewd businessman would do, Harley.
- You asked me what I'd do.
- That was my first mistake.
Stop it! Move!
Runaway!
Easy, easy.
Give him his head, ma'am.
Just ain't used to that kind of noise, are you, boy?
Dog-blasted train.
- Tie him up there good, will you?
- Yeah. He's all right now, ma'am.
Why, thank you, sugar.
You hadn't come, that horse might've been running till the dry season.
I don't know.
Everything takes practice.
Why, honey, you ain't got nothing going at all for you, have you?
Hope nobody mistakes you for a fence post and tacks wire to you.
I never been beef plumb to the hocks.
- I eat a good bit, but it burns up fast.
- Well, I'll tell you what you do.
You come to my place, and I'll fill you to the brim and pack it down.
The best food in Cheyenne.
The Nashville House, right over there.
Yes, ma'am. Nashville House. I'll sure...
That's your boss?
No, ma'am. John's a Texas cowboy come to Cheyenne for neck meat or nothing.
I just rode along to hang a rattle with him.
Well, now, don't forget, you hear?
The Nashville House.
And ask for Alice.
How do I look?
You sure are pretty.
You know, l... I even feel like a successful businessman.
You keep yourself neat and well-dressed, you have the...
The respect of your fellow...
It goes along with responsibility.
Harley, why are you with me?
John, I've rode with you for 10 years now.
- I know that, Harley, but why?
- Why?
Don't you see what I'm trying to get at?
Here you've been with me for 10 years, and I don't even know why.
- How come you never asked before?
- Don't know.
Never thought of about it until just now.
- Does it worry you?
- No.
No. But, Harley, when I got that letter from Mr. Willowby...
...and told you I was going to Cheyenne, you didn't say a word. Not a thing.
You just got on your horse and come along.
You didn't even ask me why I was going to Cheyenne...
...till we'd been out on the trail the best part of a month.
It does worry you, John. I can tell.
Well, if somebody had been riding with you for 10 years...
...and you didn't know why, wouldn't you wonder about it?
Well...
- Pardon me, miss.
- Yes?
Could you direct me to the Cheyenne Social Club?
How dare you.
- What did I say?
- Too much, I reckon.
Hey, where's the Cheyenne Social Club?
Right where it's always been.
Across the tracks.
- Last place you come to.
- Much obliged.
There it is, Harley. There's my business.
It don't look like no saloon I ever seen.
It ain't what you call
"centrally located," is it?
Hello. Welcome to the Cheyenne Social Club.
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.
I ain't seen you two around before.
- Beg your pardon?
- I'm Jenny. Who are you, honey?
Oh, my name's John O'Hanlan, this here is Harley Sullivan.
I've come up from Texas to take possession of...
O'Hanlan?
Are you the late D.J.'s brother?
Yes, ma'am, I sure am.
Did you know D. J?
Know him? Why, bless your heart.
I hope to tell you I knew him.
I was his favorite.
Come on in,
I'll introduce you to the other ladies.
Excuse me, which ladies are these?
Why, your ladies, of course.
Oh, now don't you worry about a thing, honey.
Every single one of us was handpicked by D.J. personal.
Ladies, guess who's here.
Harley, you don't suppose?
I mean, you don't think this is a?
You don't believe it, do you?
Do I what?
Nothing.
Just an idle thought.
D.J.'s brother?
"Ring for service.
Sara Jean, one ring.
Pauline, two rings.
Opal Ann, three rings.
Carrie Virginia, four rings."
- I can tell you now.
- Tell me what?
That question you didn't ask me about that idle thought.
You shouldn't stand out here like poor kin, honey.
Go on into the parlor and make yourselves to home.
You too, Mr. Sullivan.
Any friend of the late D.J.'s brother is a friend of ours.
- Miss... Mrs...
- Oh, it's "miss," honey.
Well, Miss Jenny, I'm gonna have to ask you a question right here and now.
I don't want to hurt your feelings, but...
Tall just like D.J.
Ladies, this is the late D.J.'s brother.
- John, ain't it?
- Oh, John. Yes, ma'am.
This is Miss Annie Jo.
John O'Hanlan.
We are so happy to have you here.
Miss Carrie Virginia.
I'm just so delighted.
Miss Pauline.
So nice to make your acquaintance, Johnny.
Miss Opal Ann.
Charmed, Johnny.
I'm just all breathless. I...
Miss Sara Jean.
You're just gonna love it here with us, Johnny.
Well, that's your inventory, John.
We're just one big happy family.
I reckon you'll wanna say a few words to us, honey.
Just to get things started off right.
You know that the late D.J. was a stickler for organization.
Ladies, John has a few words to say to us.
Well, ladies, I...
It's kind of hard for me to tell you this...
...but I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding somewhere...
...down along the line.
- That's you, Pauline.
I...
You see, when...
When l... When l...
You see, when I first heard that my brother...
...the late D.J., had remembered me in his will...
What l... What I mean is, I got this letter from a lawyer here in Cheyenne.
And all the letter said was that the...
All the letter says is that my brother,
D.J. O'Hanlan, had left me his business...
...here in Cheyenne.
It was a thing called the Cheyenne Social Club.
- And...
- Sorry.
And it...
It was a thing called the Cheyenne Social Club.
I thought it was a saloon.
- I thought it was a saloon.
- Six is me.
- Jenny, Jenny.
- Sorry, Johnny.
Things sort of pick up this time of day, and that sundown bell just keeps a-tinkling.
It's that little old sundown bell that has to do with everything I been trying to say.
Johnny, why don't you say your speech at breakfast.
That's the quiet time at the Cheyenne Social Club.
- Who says I'm gonna be here for breakfast?
- Sure you'll be here.
- This is your home now, honey.
- Home? No...
I want you to understand one thing, Jenny.
I may not be much, but my folks were fine, upstanding people.
Johnny, I gotta go.
That's my sweetie just come in on the 6:15.
- Jenny.
- Harvard man.
- You'll sleep in D.J.'s room.
- But...
We kept it just the way he left it.
- Top of the stairs. First door on the left.
- But, Jenny...
This place is busier than a Kansas City stockyard.
- Your brother?
- That's D.J.
- He favors you.
- Only in looks, Harley.
Only in looks.
- You coming?
- Where are you going?
Up to my room.
Your room.
- What are you looking at?
- You.
Why?
I don't know.
You look different somehow.
What do you mean, different?
John, it's kind of hard for me to put my finger on.
Well, try, Harley. Use them all.
Well, you just ain't the man today you was yesterday.
Leastways, not from where I stand.
Well, maybe you're not standing in the right place, Harley.
What do you...? What do you mean,
"I'm not the man today I was yesterday"?
Just like you lost yourself when you took a bath and bought that new suit of clothes.
- Lost myself?
- Ladies and all, running a place like this.
Now you... You can just stop right there.
I'm not running a place like this.
- What you gonna do, John?
- There's nothing else I can do.
I'm gonna have to fire them all.
Tomorrow morning at breakfast.
Where did you get the cigar?
Drunk give it to me when he went in.
Said he had a new baby.
You know, worthless as my late brother was, l...
I just can't understand how a man can live here and like it.
They don't seem like such bad ladies, John.
I run more to boarding houses.
Where folks pay their board and room and that's it.
I'm going down to the Great Plains Saloon to get a drink of whiskey.
You coming?
Thought you didn't want me with you.
I didn't say that.
I just wondered why you are.
You know, this is the first time in my life
I've ever been able to walk into a saloon...
...without having to wonder whether I can afford it.
It's a good feeling.
Barkeep, we'll have two base-burners.
- Did you say two?
- That's right.
- Scotland, Ireland or Kentucky?
- Oh, Kentucky.
- New in town?
- The name's O'Hanlan, up from Texas.
Wait a minute.
You D.J. O'Hanlan's brother? The one that's taking over the Cheyenne Social Club?
- Yes, I am, but...
- Well, welcome to Cheyenne, Mr. O'Hanlan.
Whiskey's on the house to you.
- Hey, hey.
- That's mighty nice of you.
Don't mention it.
D.J. drank free here...
...and, well, I got along all right at his place.
Mae, this here is D.J. O'Hanlan's brother.
I want you to take real good care of him, you hear?
- Like you did D.J.
- Yes, sir.
All right, boys. Let's move it.
- Why?
- What for?
For D.J. O'Hanlan's brother, that's what for.
Well, sure.
Glad to meet you, Mr. O'Hanlan.
I'd do anything for D.J.'s brother.
- Let me shake your hand, Mr. O'Hanlan.
- All right, boys. That's all.
- Let me shake your hand.
- Hope to see a lot of you.
- An honor to know you.
- This was D.J.'s favorite table.
From now on, it'll be permanently reserved for you.
Anything you want, you just ask for it.
After we get to know you better, you won't even have to ask, it'll be there.
How do you like your beefsteak,
Mr. O'Hanlan?
- Beg your pardon?
- Your beefsteak.
D.J. always used to send me out for a beefsteak for him.
He liked his rare.
Oh, well, well, I'll...
- I'll have mine well-done.
- Well-done. Yes, sir.
Thank you.
You want a beefsteak, Harley?
Well, thank you, John, but I ain't too hungry just now.
I think I'll just muck around town a while and see what I can see.
- Are you coming back?
- Well, I don't know, John.
Popular as you are, it makes me kind of skittish just to be close to you.
- Mind if I sit down?
- Not at all.
Not at all.
- Here, have a cigar?
- Never use them.
Here you are, Mr. O'Hanlan.
Now, anything else you want, you just give me the look.
Thank you, Mae, thank you.
You know what I don't like about you?
You and them women of yours think they're better than everybody else.
I was out at that place of yours once.
She insulted me.
That one called Jenny?
The way she acts, you'd think she was the Queen of England.
She said I smelled bad.
Wouldn't even let me hold her hand unless I took a bath.
Well, did you?
- Did I what?
- Take a bath.
You must be soft between the head-handles, mister.
This here territory is full of women...
...you don't have to smell like lilac water to get next to.
I'll bet that's the dying truth.
Now, if you don't mind,
I'll eat my beefsteak.
No, sir.
I don't like you at all.
Hello, Slim.
- I see you found me, huh?
- Couldn't hardly miss you.
Oh, some think I'm fat, maybe, but it's not so. I'm just well-rounded.
Gives a man something to hang on to in the rough country.
You might be on the plump side, Alice, but I think you're kind of pretty.
- Do you really, sugar?
- Sure I do.
Don't go counting on me for nothing colorful.
I used to be a real cedar-breaker.
Now I'm just bringing up the drags, looking for a gut-warmer and a salt-lick.
I bet if I opened up the gates you'd come out a-stooping, huh?
Might at that.
Well, come on over here to a table, let me introduce you to some hot grub.
Here, honey, you sit right down here and keep Dr. Foy and Mr. Yancey company.
I'll send some whiskey over on my way to the kitchen.
- I'm Harley Sullivan.
- Dr. Michael Foy.
My longtime friend, Mr. C.Y. Yancey.
Oh, Mr. Yancey doesn't shake hands.
Germs, you know. Nothing personal.
You staying here in town?
Cheyenne Social Club.
- You mean, you live there?
- Moved in today.
They tell me you need a character reference to get past the front door of that place.
It's what you might call "high-toney."
All imported stock, so they tell me.
The best in the West, so they say.
Hey, Slim.
Sink your teeth into this, honey, and you can ride the high range this winter.
Mind if I ask, why you staring at me?
Why is he staring at me?
He likes you.
If he didn't like you, he'd leave.
Are you...?
Is he really 111 years old?
He sure is. And he never felt better, thanks to Blue Nectar.
Mr. Yancey, how many bottles of Blue...?
How many bottles of Blue Nectar you figure Mr. Yancey drunk in his life.
Oh, 10 or 12,000 bottles or so.
And look how steady his nerves are.
Yeah, they are kind of steady, ain't they?
Need something?
- Anything more, Mr. O'Hanlan?
- Well, I'll tell you, Mae.
You just might give me a little taste of that Irish whiskey now.
Slim, I think you and me could make the sparks go if we worked at it a little bit.
Well, Alice, it makes me proud that you think so highly of me...
...but I wouldn't...
I just wouldn't know where to begin.
Let alone finish.
You said you thought I was pretty.
And I meant it, Alice. I really did.
You mind not?
Will you tell him to stop staring at me?
Mr. Sullivan, you're not being very respectful to an old gentleman.
I definitely think it's time that we parted ways.
Let's go, Mr. Yancey.
We have a long day tomorrow.
- Mr. Yancey.
- He's drunk.
He ain't drunk.
He's dead.
What? Hey, you two, come on.
Go take this man out of here.
Slim, l...
I don't want you to let this upset you.
Alice, I'm plumb out of flint.
- How you doing?
- I never felt better glued-together.
What do you say we walk back?
I tell you, Harley, as soon as the ladies are all gone...
...I’m gonna have a business as solid and as respectable...
...as Bullion's Dry Goods Store.
Solid, solid, respectable...
...Republican business.
That's what makes America, Harley.
My folks were Democrats, John.
And look where it got you.
A lifetime on the range, and sweating in the summer...
...and freezing in the winter, and sleeping on the ground...
...and fighting the wolves and the rattlesnakes.
No, no, Harley.
There can't be a finer calling in the whole world...
...than being a Republican businessman.
I don't like to dispute you, John, but didn't you always vote Democratic?
Well, that was when
I didn't know any better.
Harley...
...I want you to do me a favor.
Don't tell anybody here in Cheyenne
I ever voted Democratic.
- You'll do that for me, won't you?
- lf you say so.
- Thank you.
- John.
You don't mind if I still vote Democratic, do you?
Just so long as you're not seen with me when you do it. It'd be bad for business.
Oh, rolling stone.
Hooray for Cheyenne.
She didn't... No question.
- I tell you, Harley, Cheyenne has to be...
- Good night, Johnny.
Oh, good night?
Carrie Virginia.
Good night, Carrie Virginia.
I tell you, Cheyenne has to be the friendliest town...
Johnny.
Oh, good evening, Jenny.
I waited up for you, John...
...because I didn't want you to go to sleep tonight without knowing how I feel.
It's just...
Well, it...
It's so good to have you here.
Well, already I feel like
I've knowed you for years and years.
And it makes me all warm inside just knowing you're in the house.
Just across the hall from me.
I hope you feel the same way...
...knowing I'm close by.
Yeah, Cheyenne's gotta be the friendliest town in the West.
Did you ever in your whole life see anything like it?
Sure ain't. Not even in Texas.
Well...
I always did this for the late D.J.
I was his favorite, you know.
- Thank you?
- Opal Ann.
Why, how sweet of you to remember.
You know, you wouldn't look bad at all, honey...
...if you scrape off some of the topsoil.
- What's this?
- Just what it looks like, Johnny.
D.J. always had a glass of warm milk with a raw egg in it before he went to bed.
Claimed it kept his strength up and helped his complexion.
It wasn't his complexion I cared about.
Well, if I can do anything else for you,
I'm just down the hall.
Third door on the right.
You expecting company?
I just wanna look my best in the morning when I talk to the ladies.
When you tell them what you gotta say...
...it ain't gonna make no difference how you look.
And he was bragging about how much he could drink without feeling it.
Well, I said, the only reason he couldn't feel it was he was numb to begin with.
- Come on, John.
- Good morning, John.
- Good morning, honey.
- Sit here, honey.
Thank you.
Your brother, the late D.J., always liked to have coffee with us in the morning.
- I'll get you some.
- Thank you.
Hi, hi.
I just wanted to tell you ladies what
I didn't get a chance to tell you yesterday.
Why, sure, Johnny. I'll just call Opal Ann.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Opal Ann.
Opal Ann.
- What is it?
- Come on in.
Johnny's got something to tell us.
Y'all go on. I'll get the edges.
I'll be thinking about you, Harley.
I'll be thinking about you too, Opal Ann.
- Want some sugar, honey?
- No, I'll just take it like it is.
The late D.J. just loved sugar.
- He was quite a man.
- He was, huh?
- He sure was.
- He liked the best of everything.
He did...
Hi there.
Well, ladies,
I'd just like to say that...
John, before you say whatever's on your mind...
...do you mind if I ask you a favor?
Why, of course. What is it?
Do you mind if I take off for a month or so?
I wanna go back east and visit my boy.
Your boy? You mean, you have a son?
Yes. You see, he goes to military school in Virginia and doing right well.
I ain't seen him in two years.
Oh, well, that's perfectly all right with me.
Let's see. You're?
- Annie Jo.
- Annie Jo. Annie Jo. Yes, that's...
Why, the truth is, it couldn't come at a better time.
Oh, that's so wonderful kind of you.
Because I'm closing the house until I can decide what to do with it.
What did you say, John?
I said I was closing the house, Jenny.
I'm closing down.
You mean you're throwing us out?
Oh, I wouldn't put it in that way, Jenny.
- Well, just how would you put it, honey?
- Listen, this just isn't my line.
So I'm gonna lock the place up until I can figure out what to do.
I don't know.
I may open a boarding house.
- I don't know yet.
- And what'll happen to us?
You can go somewheres else, can't you?
There must be a million...
You're not the late D.J.'s brother.
The late D.J. had a heart.
- You...
- Well, you don't have to...
You...
Jenny, will you tell the ladies for me...
...that I didn't mean that they had to get out right this minute.
I mean, they can have all the time they want to pack.
That's right big of you, John.
- You tell them that for me, will you?
- Why didn't you wait till Christmas Eve?
Harley!
Did you tell them?
I told them.
Well, what they say?
They're not talking to me.
Too blunt, John.
Bluntness is a flaw in a man's character.
If a man wants to get somewhere, he's got to be what they call "diplomatic."
I mean, if a man wants to reach one of them shady way stations...
...along the torturous, spine-busting road of life, he can't be blunt with folks.
John, you're nickel-plated, but you can be rougher on folks than an Indian haircut.
I'm not saying you're bored for the hollow horn, but...
...sometimes you leave folks with the taste of gone-bad pooch...
...you know what I mean?
I mean, some of the words
I heard you put on folks...
...I’m surprised you ain't been brought up to a stiff rope and a short drop.
Well, is there anything else?
Well...
Yeah, John, there is one other thing.
I was wondering if you could see your way clear to loaning me some money.
You don't have to if you don't want to, but I thought since you got so much...
...you might see your way clear to...
First, you deliver the sermon, and then you pass the collection plate.
I didn't go for you to take it like that.
How much money do you want, Harley?
Fifteen or $20 ought to do me.
- And what do you need it for?
- Things.
- What kind of things?
- Just... Just things.
You know, like a drink of whiskey if I wanted...
...or a new shirt or something.
You already have two shirts.
You don't wear but one at a time unless it's winter.
There you go, thinking like a Republican again.
Yeah, well, you don't bring up politics while you're borrowing money, Harley.
It ain't seemly.
The ladies don't understand.
They asked me to find out for them.
Find out what, Jenny?
What we did to cause you to hate us so much.
- Jenny, I don't hate you.
- You don't love us.
- Can't you understand...?
- Why, we took to you right off.
Opal Ann even remarked...
...how you was distinguished-looking and gallant.
All I'm trying to tell you is...
- Opal Ann said that?
- And handsome.
She say that too?
"Handsome and well-stood-up," them was her words.
- I appreciate... Thank you.
- What do you do?
Why, you stay one night, and you just throw us out.
Why there ain't a lady in the Cheyenne Social Club...
...that wouldn't do anything the world for you...
...you being the late D.J.'s brother and all.
But we just loved his heart.
We just loved him to death.
- Jenny...
- Smothered him with affection.
Turned down his bed at night, polished his boots.
- Don't cry.
- Trimmed his nails.
- Jenny, please.
- Sat up with him when...
Will you stop crying and listen to me?
Now, some men are just cut out for one thing...
...and some men are cut out for something else.
- And my brother...
- D.J.
D.J., he must have been a master at what he did.
I mean, he must have been a real beauty at what he did.
But I'm cut from a different bolt of cloth.
Burlap is what you're cut from.
- I was just trying to...
- lf the late D.J. was here...
...he'd take care of Pauline.
Now, what's she gonna do with her liver?
- Her liver?
- Poor Pauline.
What about Pauline's liver?
The late D.J. never came into my room without knocking.
He was a gentleman.
I declare...
- Pretty, ain't it?
- I've seen some beds in my time...
...but I never... I can't... I just-
I can't find the words to...
It just kind of grabs you, doesn't it?
I had it custom-made. Solid mahogany.
Ivory rollers, goose-down mattress and Swiss springs.
What's that?
- Spurs.
- What?
Well, with a bed like this, you could set up as a museum.
That's what I may be doing, thanks to you.
Well, now, what is all this about poor Pauline's liver?
Don't know what they call it, but it's something terrible.
If your brother was alive, he'd see she got it fixed.
The late D.J. took care of us.
Well, how much money does she need to get her liver fixed?
- Five hundred dollars.
- Five hundred dollars for a liver?
That's what the big doctor in Chicago charges.
He's got all kinds of fancy letters in the back of his name.
I don't care what he has in back of his name.
Five hundred dollars? That's more than you have to pay for a good horse.
I told you you didn't care.
Pauline, l...
I wondered how long it was gonna take you.
I beg your pardon?
I was D.J.'s favorite too.
Well, Pauline,
I've come to give you something.
I'll just bet you have.
I've heard it's better to give than receive, but I'd a lot rather receive.
Yes, you take this.
Pauline, I want you...
I want you to take this.
Just put it on the dresser, honey.
Well, now, Pauline, you don't understand.
I want you to take it and get on the train and go to that doctor in Chicago.
You know, that liver doctor that Jenny told me about?
That doctor with all the letters and things in back of his name?
Bless your thoughtful heart,
John O'Hanlan.
That's just the nicest thing anybody's ever done.
Pauline, I don't want to be blunt...
...because bluntness is a flaw in a man's character.
And, Pauline, you're... You're sick.
Yeah.
You don't care what you step on, do you, Harley?
Are you comfortable, Harley?
Like I've died and went to heaven.
Come on in, John.
Harley, I wanna talk to you.
- What about?
- Business.
Well, does it have to be now?
What do you want me to do,
Harley, make an appointment?
Oh, all right, don't go getting on your high horse.
I'll be back.
What do you want to talk about?
Harley, I don't think they believe they really have to get out.
I mean, I haven't seen one of them pack or anything.
Are they talking to you yet?
Well, yes, Jenny's talking a little bit.
Pauline, she...
I mean, Pauline's talk...
But that's what bothers me.
I thought it bothered you when they weren't talking to you.
It did, but now it bothers me when they do.
Just like when I was married.
That's right, because when they start talking to you...
I never knew you were married.
John, it ain't something
I like to talk about...
...but I was married once, and once is enough for any man.
You can't smoke, chew, dip, drink, scratch in the parlor or cuss.
Leave the house, they ask where you're going.
Come home, they ask where you been.
And right now, with you, it's just like when I was married.
Well, how is that, Harley?
Well, John, when a woman's talking to you...
...you can be pretty sure she thinks she's in control.
When she's not talking to you, you can be pretty certain you're in control.
And you think I'm not in control now?
- Do you?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
Well, what do you think?
John, I don't understand your problem.
What more could you ask for than what you got now?
You got money, a fine house, all them friends.
Here you follow me all the way up here from Texas...
...and now you can't even be a little help.
- I'm trying to, John.
- You know what your problem is, Harley?
You just don't understand anything.
Nothing Harley. Just nothing.
Somewhere along the way, you just faded right out of the big picture of life.
John, you just ain't got no right to talk to me like this.
- You just...
- We've rode together too long.
- All right, go on in there with?
- Opal Ann.
Opal Ann. Go on.
You've changed, John.
You really have.
Ever since you come into fame and fortune.
Good evening.
Hi.
Let me have a drink of whiskey, barkeep.
- Better drink somewhere else, O'Hanlan.
- What are you talking about?
We were doing all right here in Cheyenne till you showed up.
All I want is a drink of whiskey.
What's the matter?
I've heard tell of some mean ones in my life, but you got them all beat, O'Hanlan.
Yeah, what did those ladies ever do to you?
I bet you'd foreclose on widowers and orphans, wouldn't you?
Well, stranger, I don't see it's any concern of yours what I do.
I ought to have your butt kicked is what.
- And would you like to try it?
- No. Not in here, you don't.
You gonna give me a whiskey, or ain't you?
Try the Lady of Egypt Saloon, O'Hanlan.
Only, if you're thirsty, don't tell them who you are.
We sure don't need the likes of him around.
Ought to set up as a preacher is what he ought to do.
John.
- Can I buy you a whiskey?
- That's mighty kind of you, Mr. Willowby.
I was hoping somebody would offer me a drink before bedtime.
I believe you've met my associate,
Mr. Potter.
- Hello.
- Mr. Clay Carroll, Mr. John O'Hanlan.
- How are you, sir?
- The pleasure is mine, Mr. O'Hanlan.
Mr. Carroll is a lace and button drummer.
Occurs to me the two of you might do some business together.
What kind of business are you in,
Mr. O'Hanlan?
Well, the fact is, Mr. Carroll,
I'm not really in business yet. I just...
O'Hanlan is hiding his light under a bushel.
He owns the Cheyenne Social Club.
So you're that O'Hanlan.
- Is something wrong?
- What...
Mr. Willowby, will you explain to him that...
Not many men would have the guts to close down a historical monument.
What historical monument is that,
Mr. Carroll?
Your Cheyenne Social Club, that's what historical monument.
The Cheyenne Social Club is a...
It was there when there wasn't a railroad for 300 miles.
It's withstood prairie fire and Indian attacks.
And the first ounce, O'Hanlan...
...the first ounce of gold discovered in this territory...
...was spent wisely and well at the Cheyenne Social Club.
And you...
...you come up here from Texas and close it down.
Well, now, Mr. Carroll, I didn't figure
I was doing anything all that terrible.
The fact is, where I come from, it'd be considered something of a public service.
You don't say.
Yes, sir, I do say.
You must come from a part of Texas that I ain't heard of.
I have a feeling you mean something by that.
Sure, I mean something.
You Texans are just like little birds.
All mouth and full of...
Mister, you just drawed on an inside straight.
Gentlemen, now, gentlemen, we can settle our differences... Not on...
Oh, that was beautiful.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Hit him! Hit him! Come on!
I got a nice place here.
Mr. Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan!
If you're looking for Harley, he's busy right now.
- Well, where is he?
- He was with Carrie Virginia a while ago...
...but him and Pauline have struck up an acquaintance now.
That Harley. He's like a bad outlaw.
- Just keeps moving from place to place.
- Mr. Sullivan.
Mr. Sullivan?
Mr. Sullivan!
You calling me?
Your friend Mr. O'Hanlan is in a terrible fight.
You don't say.
Yes. It's a terrible thing going on up at that saloon...
...and he needs help.
Why?
He's outnumbered something terrible,
Mr. Sullivan.
- What are the odds?
- Well, it must be five, maybe six to one.
And you figure my weight might make the difference?
Well, you are friends.
Mr. Potter, friends should stay out of one another's business.
John wouldn't appreciate me interfering.
I hear you got John O'Hanlan locked up.
- You a friend of his?
- That's right.
- You come up here from Texas with him?
- Sure did.
That was a bad move.
You can have five minutes.
What happened, John?
Harley, you'd think
I was closing down the Alamo.
Well, I knew from the start you wasn't gonna have no easy time of it.
Folks just don't like it when you start in attacking public institutions.
- John, I just think your trouble...
- Harley, Harley, would you just forget it.
Just how... How are the ladies?
Doing real fine, from what I can see.
- Any of them packing yet?
- No sign of it.
There must be some way to get those women out of there.
Would you tell Mr. Willowby
I'd like to talk to him?
He's still in the doc's office.
- I didn't know he was sick.
- He weren't till you started that fight.
He was met in the face by a piano stool, so they say.
I hear that saloon looks like it was in the path of a buffalo stampede.
All for a good cause, Harley.
All for Texas.
Three hundred and twelve dollars and ten cents.
Now if everybody's satisfied,
I think I'll be on my way.
Just do me a favor, O'Hanlan, stay out of my place.
The unfriendliest town
I've ever come across.
People insult you or don't talk to you at all.
Can't get a drink.
Mr. Willowby, I wonder if I could have a little chat with you.
Oh, Mr. Willowby, you just look terrible.
A piano stool did all that, huh?
I heard you got your jaw hurt, but nobody said anything about that.
That's just the worst-looking eye
I have ever seen, Mr. Willowby.
I remember a fellow down in Texas...
...he bent down to tie his boot lace and got kicked right in the face...
...by a 20-year-old mule named Hattie.
Lost every single one of his teeth right there on the spot.
But I believe, if yours was compared to his, you'd win out.
Well, I know you're a very busy man,
Mr. Willowby...
...so I won't take up too much of your time.
But, you know, I've always wondered...
...what it would be like to be a man of property.
And now I know.
And it feels good.
Why, for the first time in my life,
I feel like I'm really somebody.
You understand what I mean,
Mr. Willowby?
By golly, that's a terrible looking eye.
Well, anyway, I suppose you've heard
I'm letting the ladies go.
And what I'm thinking about doing...
...is making the Cheyenne Social Club into a boarding house.
You know, with meals and singing in the parlor on Saturday night.
And songs like "The Old Gray Mare" and "Hanging Out the Linen Clothes."
But my favorite is "The True Lover's Farewell."
You know that one?
I forget how that goes.
That's it. That's my favorite.
As soon as I change over and all the ladies are gone...
- You can't do it.
- How's that again, Mr. Willowby?
It's the Cheyenne Social Club or nothing.
I don't think I'm following you.
It's the agreement your brother had with the railroad.
What's the railroad got to do with it?
It's my house.
The house is yours, but the house sits on the railroad right-of-way.
- Mr. Willowby...
- It's simple, O'Hanlan.
When the railroad was buying up land for its right-of-way, your brother sold to them.
Like everybody else, he wanted the railroad in Cheyenne, but with one provision:
That the Cheyenne Social Club could stay just the way it was...
...as long as the girls were there.
Benefited everybody.
- And if the girls go?
- The house goes.
Mr. Willowby, are you telling me that I don't really own it?
You own the house.
- As long as...?
- The girls stay.
- And if the girls go?
- The house goes.
The house goes.
Well, it was nice chatting with you,
Mr. Willowby.
John. I'm glad you're finally here.
- Where is everybody? They all leave?
- Up in Jenny's room.
I sent for the doctor.
Is Jenny sick?
She get beat up, John.
Real beat up.
Looks bad. She's...
Well, she's been asking for you.
Oh, honey.
You know, something, Johnny?
No, just don't try to talk, Jenny.
The doctor is coming.
All my life, l...
I've liked people.
Even...
Even...
...people nobody else liked.
- I...
- I know.
But nobody's got the right to...
...do this to another person.
- Mr. O'Hanlan?
- Yes.
I'm Dr. Carter.
I came as soon as I could.
- Get her well, doctor.
- I always do my best, Mr. O'Hanlan.
I think she'll be all right eventually, but she's in bad shape.
She has bruises over 40 percent of her body.
Three broken ribs, some sprains and maybe some kidney damage.
It's too early yet to know.
- You just make sure she stays in bed.
- Yes.
I'll examine her in the morning.
Good night.
Good night.
John.
- Who did it to her, Harley?
- Wait a minute, John.
Who did it to her?
John, you ain't no hand with a gun, and I ain't neither.
- I wasn't here when it happened.
- What's his name?
Opal Ann says his name is Corey Bannister.
Did she mention where he could be found?
John, you know you can't draw worth a penny.
- Where, Harley?
- Great Plains Saloon.
John.
John, can't we talk about this before you go to doing something rash?
- What do you want, O'Hanlan?
- The man that beat up one of my...
One of my girls.
They tell me his name's Corey Bannister, and they tell me I can recognize him...
...by a streak of yellow down his back.
I'm Bannister.
- I figured you were.
- Well?
Ever hear about what we do down in Texas to a man that beats up on women?
Suppose you tell me.
We drag him through cactus.
No cactus around here.
So I noticed.
Just like D.J. would have done.
How you feeling, Jenny?
Honey, just like I've been stomped on by a bad bull.
Well, doc says to get some soup into you, so that's what we're gonna do.
Did you ever love a woman, Johnny?
I mean, really love her?
Yeah, thought I did once.
Come to find out it was indigestion.
You won't believe it, but a man once loved me.
Oh, he was a real good man too.
He went to Oregon.
Was gonna send for me.
Got shot in Portland.
I cried and cried.
It was really me I was crying for.
When I was young,
I had all sorts of dreams.
- Something awful sad about an old dream.
- Yeah, I know.
When I was a boy down in the panhandle...
...that was before I slipped my hobbles,
I was a real star-gazer.
I tell you, Jenny,
I dreamed and I planned big things.
And then I started drifting.
Been drifting ever since.
Come on, come on.
Have some more soup.
- Goodbye, honey.
- See you later, Carrie Virginia.
- Hey, that for Jenny?
- Sure is.
- How is she?
- Doing real good.
You're not doing so bad yourself, are you, honey?
I suppose you've come to see me about that little thing last night.
That wasn't any little thing you did,
O'Hanlan, that was a Bannister you shot.
I've been wanting to do it for years.
- You haven't come to arrest me?
- I come to warn you.
When you kill one Bannister,
500 will come to his funeral.
Oh, you mean, some of his kin might come here for me, huh?
You can chisel it in granite.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
My advice to you is to grab onto the tail of the first horse you see traveling south.
- Go back to Texas, you mean?
- Still there, ain't it?
Makes no difference to me, but them
Bannisters is meaner than tiger spit.
Can't I count on any help from you?
Oh, I have to go to Medicine Bow for a prisoner.
But whatever you do, do it like you mean it.
Well, how much time do I have?
Three days at the most.
They live quite a ways out of town.
But trouble rides a fast horse.
What do you suppose we should do,
Harley?
What do you mean "we," John?
You could wait around and help me out, you know.
I said it before and I'm saying it again:
Neither one of us is any hand with a gun.
I did all right last night, didn't I?
John, I don't want to hurt your feelings...
...but Corey Bannister is probably the first man ever killed by a pecan.
What are you talking about?
John, how much of that inheritance money you got left?
A dollar or two, after I pay the doctor for Jenny.
Mr. Willowby says you can't open a boarding house or anything else, didn't he?
What's your point?
You got exactly what you come to Cheyenne with. Nothing.
I still don't get your point.
There ain't nothing keeping you here.
Come on back to Texas with me.
What kind of a man are you anyway, Harley?
You've been riding with me for 10 years, and I don't even know you.
Do you think for one minute that my late brother D.J. would go away...
...and leave these ladies to face the Bannisters?
Well, do you?
Well, do you?
I don't reckon he would, John.
It don't make any sense staying to meet them Bannisters.
You get hurt that way.
I don't wanna get hurt.
I ain't yellow, but it don't make any sense at all in begging for it.
Old John will probably be outnumbered 10 to one.
Ten to two don't make it any better.
- You're sure she's gonna be all right?
- Yes, she'll be fine.
But she shouldn't exert herself too soon.
- You mean get out of bed?
- No, that isn't what I mean. I mean...
Let me put it this way, Mr. O'Hanlan:
- She shouldn't receive visitors for a while.
- I get you.
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.
Seen your smoke, smelled your coffee.
Can you spare a cup?
Get down and sit, mister.
I reckon you fellows have a herd somewheres abouts?
No.
You wouldn't be coming from Cheyenne, would you?
Sure am.
- You got a name?
- Harley Sullivan, headed for Texas.
Heard they had a little shooting in Cheyenne?
Sure did.
You see it?
- I was there.
- O'Hanlan must be some hand with a gun.
No, he can't draw at all.
You say he can't?
Makes out all right with a rifle if he's got lots of time...
...but when it comes to pistols, well, you can forget it.
It's plumb pitiful.
Well, it sounds like you know this O'Hanlan pretty good.
Well, as anybody, I reckon.
I don't understand him, but I know him.
You fellows headed for Cheyenne?
If this O'Hanlan is as bad at drawing as you say he is...
...how was it he outdrawed Corey?
Did...?
- Did you know Corey Bannister?
- I'm his uncle.
Uncle?
- And these here fellows, I reckon, are...?
- Cousins.
Thank you for your coffee.
If you ever come to Texas, look me up.
I wouldn't have said it right to his face...
...but wild horses couldn't drag me to Texas.
All right, mister, get up against that wall.
- What did he do to you?
- He didn't...
I ain't done nothing, Mr. O'Hanlan.
- Tell him, Carrie Virginia.
- Well, then why are you crying?
- I'm so happy.
- You're happy?
Pete asked me to marry with him.
Nobody has ever asked me to do that before.
It's true, Mr. O'Hanlan,
I did ask her.
And before she started crying, she said I'd have to ask you.
- Ask me what?
- For her hand.
I'll talk to him outside. l... I'm just so proud.
I know you are, Carrie Virginia.
I know you are.
- Your name Pete?
- Pete Dodge.
- You love her?
- Yes, sir, I do.
- Do you go to church?
- Yes, sir.
Every Sunday morning, right after I leave here.
- Will you promise to take good care of her?
- Sure do my best.
That isn't what I asked you.
Yes, sir, I promise to take real good care of her.
All right, Pete, I'll tell Carrie Virginia you asked me for her hand and I gave it.
Thank you, Mr. O'Hanlan.
Just where do you think you're going?
- Well, I was gonna go...
- After the wedding, Pete.
- After?
- After.
Well, but you don't seem to understand.
- You see, we've been seeing each other...
- After.
After.
Maybe we should go out there and give O'Hanlan some help.
No. D.J.'s brother won't need no help.
He might even be insulted.
Oh, well, I'll stay right here, then.
I sure wouldn't want to insult him.
You sure are something, honey.
Most men, if they knew the Bannisters were coming, would be fidgety.
I'm only fidgety when I'm not certain, Pauline.
This time I'm certain.
I don't stand a chance.
I never knew a man so modest.
Johnny, you got enough guts to fill a smokehouse.
Bravest bull in the barn.
Fred, Seph, get out there behind those ties.
When he shows himself, get him.
O'Hanlan, come on out!
All right, ladies, everybody upstairs.
Now, Johnny, don't get yourself killed...
Keep down, honey, and stay inside.
Stay in your rooms till it's over.
Hey, O'Hanlan, come on out!
We're gonna have us a party.
I'm sorry, I don't like crowds.
Oh, you'll like us.
We're the Bannisters.
Everybody in this territory likes the Bannisters.
That's why they seldom kill one of us.
I ain't coming out, and you ain't coming in.
And that's the way it's gonna be all day.
All together.
If one of us can get inside, we've got him.
Go on.
What are you doing?
The doctor said...
Honey, after all you've done for me, the least I can do is load for you.
You in there, boy?
Call out!
He's in here.
Jed, you run pretty fast, don't you, boy?
I make out.
Give your cousin Jed cover.
- Give it all you got, boy.
- I aim to.
- Is that you, Harley?
- It's me, John.
- You all right?
- Just fine.
Harley?
Harley?
Texas.
Harley Sullivan.
Harley Sullivan!
Uncle Charlie!
I knew you could do it.
Because I'm D.J.'s brother?
No, honey.
Because you're you.
Congratulations!
Right this way, gentlemen.
Right this way.
I heard you were coming, so I went ahead and ordered your beefsteak.
Hey, Mae.
All right, boys, that's enough.
That's enough, boys.
Thank you. Thank you.
- I'll buy you a drink later.
- Whiskey's on the house.
- Thank you.
- How lovely to see you.
Oh, hello, Mae. Thank you.
- I'll get your steaks right away.
- Thank you.
Well, I declare...
Harley, why'd you come back?
John, you think I'd really left you?
- You mean, you didn't?
- You ought to know me better than that.
Here you are, gentlemen.
Just the way you like it.
Where did you go?
What difference does it make?
I was there when you needed me.
You thought I was scared of getting hurt, didn't you?
Well, I have to tell you the truth,
Harley, I did.
I did, and I apologize for misjudging you.
I thought you'd know me better than that, after all the years we've rode together.
It just goes to prove you never really know a man...
...until the chips are down and you need him most.
I appreciate you helping me out.
I never knowed it before, John...
...but a good gun fight sure makes a man hungry.
Hi there.
Thought you'd wanna know, Ray Markstone just rode out of town to get his family.
I expect the town will fill up with them before the end of the week.
I don't believe I've ever met anybody by that name, marshal. Who are they?
Blood kin of the Bannisters.
And they're coming to see me, are they?
No, I suppose they're coming to see both of you.
- Then I think I'll head on back.
- Just a minute, Harley.
How many Markstones are there?
Oh, 60 or 70, I imagine, up in the Jackson Hole country.
Maybe another 50 or so here and there around the territory.
Well, I just wanted to warn you before I leave town.
You won't be here when they come, marshal?
Oh, I'd like to be, O'Hanlan.
I really would. But I have to ride to Fort Laramie to identify a prisoner.
Well, good luck.
Busy as he is traveling, it's right decent of him to take the time to tell us.
It's hard for me to say this, Mr. Willowby...
...because I have just come to like the ladies so much...
You know, Jenny and the others.
Nice ladies, all of them.
But this Cheyenne Social Club just isn't my kind of a thing.
What with the money lending and the saloon fights...
...and the doctoring and the gun fights.
Let me speak for Cheyenne,
Mr. O'Hanlan.
Cheyenne is grateful.
There's some talk of running you for mayor next election.
Do you know, that first day when I left this office...
...I thought all my dreams had come true.
- Great.
- Yes, sir.
When you're out on the range with nobody to talk to most of the time but your horse...
...you do a lot of dreaming.
And I dreamed of being a man of property.
But, you know... You know, Mr. Willowby...
And I didn't realize it then...
...but I have always been a man of property.
I have my horse.
I have my blanket.
I have the whole West to ride in.
How could a man own more than that?
No, I...
Mr. Willowby, I'm a cowboy.
Always have been.
And I know now I always will be.
What are you gonna do?
Well, me and Harley's going back to Texas.
And I want you to transfer the Cheyenne Social Club to Jenny's name.
- Now, Mr. O'Hanlan, are you certain...?
- Yes, sir.
Yes, I want Jenny and all the other ladies always to have a place they can call home.
Very well. I'll see that it's done.
Thank you, Mr. Willowby.
I appreciate it.
Well, I guess it's time to go out and say goodbye to the ladies.
I reckon so.
I don't know what to say to them, Harley.
What would you say?
- Goodbye?
- That's all?
You walk in and say goodbye and walk out?
What's wrong with it?
Well, for one thing, Harley, it's downright rude.
And for another thing, it's blunt.
Well, John, you asked me, and I told you.
What else do you want?
Nothing, Harley. Nothing.
Ladies, I don't exactly know how to tell you this...
...because I didn't know it was gonna come to this.
Oh, there's that bell.
I'm sorry, honey.
- You go right on with what you're saying.
- Well, I haven't said anything yet.
Well, anyways, I had a little chat with Mr. Willowby, you know...
Sorry, Johnny.
Well, I had this little chat with Mr. Willowby, the lawyer?
You know?
And what he's gonna do is...
Oh, now, hold on here, Carrie Virginia.
I gave you away.
I told that fellow Pete Dodge you could marry him...
...and for him to stay away until after the wedding, didn't I?
Oh, I know, honey.
And Pete is staying away too.
He is? Well, who is...?
Oh, that's just Edgar, coming to pay his respects.
Edgar? Who's Edgar?
Pete's brother.
They're such a close family.
Close?
Close family?
What did you want to tell us, honey?
- What?
- You were saying?
Well, I guess all I really wanted to say was goodbye.
- Are you going somewhere?
- Well, l...
That's me.
- We're alone at last.
- What?
It's the first time we've ever been alone.
- What's that got to do with it?
- Why, everything, honey.
- Opal Ann, all I wanted to say was...
- I know.
You wanted to say that I'm your favorite.
Sacrifice. All I do is sacrifice.
Well, I guess I better go up and say goodbye to Jenny.
Jenny, I just came up to say good...
Goodbye, Jenny.
Reckon when you said goodbye it kind of tore them all up.
Harley, you would have thought
I was dead.
Calf on the ground.
Hot iron!
Burn him.
O'Hanlan!
This come for you.
All the way from Cheyenne.
Thanks a lot.
Who's it from?
- Jenny.
- Hey, Sullivan, give us a hand over here.
Dear Johnny...
... Mr. Willowby, the lawyer, told me
what a proud thing it was you done for us.
Nobody in the world
but you would've done it.
Except maybe D.J.
Pauline found out there wasn't really
nothing wrong with her liver.
It was just her corset was too tight.
Carrie Virginia got married to Pete Dodge
and have a baby girl now.
Pete had a fight with his brother Edgar,
but I don't know what it was about.
The day after you left Cheyenne...
... a lot of men named Markstone
came to the Social Club.
They were right sorry not to see you
and your friend Harley.
Well, Johnny, it's about sundown now,
so I'll have to stop.
I just wanted to say thank you, honey.
And I just wanted you to know
we all love you.
Affectionately, Jenny.
What she have to say, John?
Oh, nothing much.
- Why didn't you let me read it?
- Well, Harley, I just didn't think you'd care.
O'Hanlan, Sullivan, go run them calves out of that dry wash.
John, I liked them ladies just as well as you did.
- I didn't say you didn't, did I?
- But you didn't even think about me.
- Will you just let up?
- Can't you tell me what Jenny had to say?
Just things. Just...
The trouble with you is you don't think about other folks' feelings.
- Harley, come on.
- I'll tell you what.
It's ungraceful and indelicate not to let me read Jenny's letter.
- Harley, if...
- You're an old bull-windy bunch-quitter.
All ewe-necked, feather-headed, stubborn like Colorado mockingbird.
I never in my life heard anybody go on so much about a scrap of paper.
You ain't heard the first of it yet.
John, you ain't learned yet.
You can't treat people just any old way it pleases you.
I remember a man from Denver once...
- I don't wanna hear about the man from...
- You're the spitting image of him.
He never thought about another soul for a moment.
Nothing but downright selfish is what he was.
If he got a letter, he'd have done just the same thing.
If I ever get a letter from the ladies,
I'll let you read it.
That's because my heart's in the right place.
Yeah, Harley, I saw in Cheyenne where your heart is.
- What do you mean by that?
- You think on it a while, Harley.
John, all I'm trying to say is you should be more thoughtful to your fellow man
I just want you to leave me alone,
Harley, that's all.
- You could wear a man down to nothing.
- Yeah.
