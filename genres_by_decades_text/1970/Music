DONKEY SKIN
Based on the Fairy Tale by Charles Perrault
Once upon a time
there was a king so great,
so loved by his people and so respected
by neighboring kingdoms
that he was
the happiest of monarchs.
And his happiness
was even greater
for having chosen
a beautiful and virtuous wife.
The couple lived
in perfect harmony.
They had a daughter
of such grace and charm
that they never regretted
having but one child.
Their palace was a marvel
of taste and abundance.
The buildings
were magnificent,
and the vast stables were filled
with the most handsome steeds.
But what
most surprised visitors
was a donkey displayed
in the most prominent place.
This iniquity
may surprise you ,
but when you learn
of the creature’s rare ability,
you will agree
that this honor was its due.
However, the vicissitudes of life
fall on kings as well,
and the greatest good
is always mixed with misfortune.
The queen was suddenly stricken
with a cruel malady,
and neither the physicians
well-versed in Greek
nor the quacks in vogue
could do aught for her.
Allow me, before I die, to make one request.
If you should wish to remarry –
No, my dearest queen.
I would never think of it.
Ask instead that I follow you.
Our love says
I can believe you, but the state demands heirs.
I gave you only a daughter.
Your advisors will demand a son in your image.
Hush.
Listen to me.
Swear by the love you bear me to marry again only when you’ve found a woman more beautiful than myself.
Impossible!
Swear it so that I may die content.
I swear it.
The queen is dead!
Come, Father.
Leave me, child.
I never wish to see you again.
The royal cabinet!
Speak.
We think it is bad for you to remain alone – and bad for the state.
Solitude is unhealthy for kings.
It is time you remarried.
Why do you always ask the impossible?
The state needs a male heir for its peace and tranquility.
The kingdom is at peace and does not desire war.
Your advisors can but approve of your policy, but we are supposed to advise you as well.
I understand your reasons.
I can remarry, but I swore to the queen to wed only a princess more beautiful than she.
- That was a vain promise.
- How so?
A queen’s beauty matters little provided she’s virtuous and fertile.
I do not agree, and I will not break my promise.
Seek in neighboring kingdoms a princess who might suit me.
I wish but to please.
The prime minister!
Now the trouble begins.
You’re burning me!
I beg your pardon,
Your Majesty.
Well?
Two of our messengers have brought us some charming portraits.
If they’re like the others, no, thank you.
Those were so badly done that you couldn’t tell whether the girl was pretty or stupid.
Let me see.
This one’s father has the largest kingdom you could –
Come now!
Let me see!
She’s hideous!
Her father would give you half his land –
Let him keep it all.
Would you have an ugly woman on my arm?
This one is no youth, but her fortune exceeds by far –
The number of her years!
Sadness.
Boredom.
Pride.
Hypocrisy.
They’re all one-eyed or hunchbacks or perhaps deaf.
Have fairy-tale princesses all disappeared?
There is this one.
Let me see.
Good God, she’s lovely!
You kept her a secret, you traitor.
How sweet! How pure!
How graceful!
Look at the line of that shoulder.
Who is she?
Your daughter, sire.
Love is worn around the neck
The heart is mad
Four arms entwined
The soul is glad
Like a scarf
woven of white wool
Love forms a knot
Love, love
Has made me mad
Love often makes a clamor
In youth
It cries, it stings
It swears false oaths
It makes those lovers suffer
Who refuse to turn the page
Love, love
Is never wise
How lovely she is!
Lovelier than the queen, sire, and much more charming and intelligent.
When it has lived too long
With contented heart
Love, at the slightest snag
Frays
Caught on the nail of memory
Love dies in time
Love, love
I love you so!
Love, love
I love you so!
Your father, the king, has sent for you.
Love, love, I love you so!
You sent for me, Father?
Does that surprise you?
You’ve refused to see me since my mother’s death.
Did that hurt you?
- Yes, Father.
- I am sorry.
Solitude has been my sole companion.
I have decided that that must end.
Arise, dear daughter.
I was listening to you.
Your singing enchanted me.
If your soul is sensitive to music, perhaps you do not dislike poetry either.
I know little poetry, but I enjoy it.
I have some poems from the future.
The ancients wrote well, but the poets of tomorrow may delight you more.
"Listening to your fairy lute, trees and stones follow you, Orpheus, letting you shape them as you choose.
Clio, the barmaid,
Calliope phoning in a scoop...
Urania turning on the gaslights that paint the trees from below."
Do you like it?
It’s troubling.
Your godmother, the lilac fairy, gave it to me.
Her knowledge of the future amazes me.
Listen to this one.
It suits the moment so well.
"The ring is slipped on the finger after a kiss seals our vows.
What our lips murmured is in the ring on the finger.
Weave roses through your hair."
I love you, my daughter, and wish to marry you.
Poetry deranges you, Father.
I beg you to stop.
- Do you love me?
- Very much.
Very much is not enough.
Allow me to go, Father.
I feel weary and troubled.
Be that as it may,
I have decided to marry you, and marry you I will.
Ask not such a crime of me.
Let me think on it.
I give you until tomorrow.
You are wise and learned.
Your counsel has never led me astray.
I love the princess and wish to marry her.
Is mine a sinful love?
Is the princess fond of Your Majesty?
She says she loves me very much, yet she’s confused.
Do you see what I mean?
The princess is too young to understand the stirrings of her heart.
It’s written here that all little girls who are asked,
"Whom do you wish to marry when you grow up? " reply without fail,
"I want to marry Daddy."
Do you have a daughter?
Alas, no.
But if I did,
I would certainly marry her.
You are the wisest of the wise.
I shall marry the princess.
You at this hour!
You know I hate to be taken unawares.
Forgive me, godmother, but it’s terribly urgent.
Come now.
Don’t cry, child.
It will leave furrows on your face.
But it’s too dreadful!
Calm down and have a seat.
No, not a word.
I know all about it.
Let me finish dressing.
And dry your tears.
You, go outside and play.
Yellow is definitely not my color.
That’s better.
Dear child, it would be a great mistake to marry your father.
You must gently discourage him.
But I love him.
I know... but you’re confusing different kinds of love.
I must give him an answer tomorrow.
The situation
calls for great attention
Children do not marry
their parents, my child
You love your father,
and I understand
But whatever your reasons
or feelings may be
Boys do not marry
their mothers, my child
And it is the tradition
In every condition
For lawmakers to decree
That girls
do not marry their daddies
A prince with a shepherdess
may find joy
But a girl with her father
Can expect nothing
but tainted offspring
My child, you must forget
without regret
These depraved phantasms
And you will encounter
a charming ragamuffin
Or perhaps a beggar prince
But kindly abjure
This union impure
Life will offer you gifts,
my child
But first you must
Conform to the plan
I have concocted for you
Have no fear of getting lost
I shall enlighten you
at all cost
I shall protect you
and show you the way
That I have traced
without delay
Be of good cheer
I’ve arranged it all,
my dear
Don’t worry.
Nothing bad will happen to you if you follow my advice.
Are you sure?
Fairies are always right.
We must set your father an impossible challenge.
You must tell him you have a whim for – oh, I don’t know – a dress the color of... the weather.
The weather?
It’s terribly complicated and costly.
Even with all his powers, he’ll never manage it.
A dress the color of the weather – is that a condition?
More like a whim.
And then you’ll marry me?
Yes, Father.
The devil take me!
Good weather?
Bad weather?
Good weather, Father.
What kind of weather?
Good weather, of course!
And I need it by tomorrow.
We’ll never make it in time.
The color of the weather!
Horse feathers!
He succeeded!
How dreadful!
Let me look at you.
It’s gorgeous.
I’ve never had anything like it.
I honestly didn’t think it was possible.
He must love you very much indeed.
What do we do now?
We must be completely unreasonable.
Ask for a dress that’s more sparkling, less common.
A dress the color of the moon.
Go at once.
The color of the moon?
Yes, Father.
More sparkling and less common.
But that one suits you perfectly.
I find it... quite ordinary.
I would not displease you.
The color of the moon?
Yes, Father.
The color of the moon?
Even more lustrous than the nightly orb.
Now he’s asking for the moon!
What a beautiful dress!
My father’s so sweet.
I’m full of love and ready to marry him.
- You can’t.
- But he’s so nice.
Impossible.
I tore my dress again.
- How sad.
- Perhaps, but that’s life.
But something’s amiss.
My magic spell doesn’t work.
Could it be worn out?
Can a spell wear out like a dress?
No, but it can grow weak like a battery.
A battery? What’s that?
Nothing. I’m getting old.
But fairies don’t get old.
You’re right. I’d forgotten.
Still, my power over men is growing weak.
My spell doesn’t work on your father anymore.
I must admit I feel great tenderness for him.
Please!
We shall conquer this unwholesome passion.
Calm down, now.
We’ll be simply odious.
Tell him you want a dress the color of the sun.
- He’ll give it to me.
- Then we’ll see.
Anyway,
I have another idea too.
I think he’ll be surprised by the request
I advise you to make.
What now?
Listen.
No, not that!
That’s horrible!
I’d never dare!
I’d rather marry him!
- You have no choice.
Are you satisfied?
Frankly, I should like a more dazzling dress... the color of the sun.
Is this one not dazzling enough?
It could be made of gold and diamonds.
Are you vain, my dear?
Not really.
Why are you toying with me?
You shall have your dress if you assure me it’s a pledge of love and not merely a whim.
It’s no whim, Father.
Go on.
Ask him what I told you.
I can’t!
Go on.
I command you.
How dazzling!
I’ve never seen anything so radiant!
You are beautiful, daughter!
Are you happy?
I am, Father.
I’m filled with joy.
Is this your last request?
Or, before our marriage, have you some other desire
I can satisfy?
Yes, but I hesitate.
Tell me.
I’d like the skin of that old donkey in your stables.
My banker?
Yes, Father.
You surprise me with this strange request.
Someone’s put this monstrous idea into your head, probably your fairy godmother, who’s despised me ever since –
- Since when?
- That’s not important.
Besides, I don’t care what the fairies think, especially that one.
Well, if this is your last request before our marriage, it will be granted.
You will have that donkey’s skin this very night.
- Stop this childishness!
- I can’t elude him.
It’s cruel to make him suffer.
He’s already planning the wedding.
That’s just too bad.
Why must I refuse his love?
What have you got against my father?
I owe you no explanations.
Your father behaved badly in a matter that concerns him and me alone.
Fairies, like women, hold grudges.
Come now, don’t cry!
If my father loves me, why not do as he wishes?
Why flee from him?
It’s only pride.
I owe him my life, after all.
That shows how sadly lacking your education has been.
What do you advise?
You must leave at once.
He’ll find me wherever I go.
You’ll be in disguise.
You have the oddest ideas.
Hurry now.
Wrap this skin around you.
- Horrors!
Do as I say.
I have everything planned.
Where’s my wand?
Here’s a trunk for your dresses, your mirror, your diamonds and rubies.
Take my wand too.
- But what about you?
- I have another at home.
Strike the ground with this wand, and your trunk will appear whenever you need it.
Come.
- What for?
Come here.
No one must recognize you.
You enjoy making me look hideous!
Don’t be silly. I’m helping you.
This is going to be an ordeal.
Life is not as easy as you think, even for the daughter of a king.
Now, a carriage awaits at the gate to take you to safety beyond the seas.
Good luck, my child.
Lend me my wand to get home.
Come in, Donkey Skin.
I’ve been expecting you.
I need a scullery maid to wash the rags.
Yes, ma’am.
Call me "old woman" – or don’t address me at all.
You’ll start tomorrow.
Everyone’s asleep today.
You’re even filthier than I expected.
Scullery maids are always filthy.
You think too much.
Go clean the pig trough.
- Yes, old woman.
I’m tired from my long journey.
Where may I rest?
There’s a hut in the forest.
Off with you.
How wretched!
Where do I start?
The bed.
A chair.
The table.
A looking glass.
Candles.
And my trunk.
Love, love, I love you so
I love you so
The princess
cannot be found.
Search the stables,
the sheepfold, the cellars.
We’ve searched
everywhere.
She was asleep
in her bedroom last night.
Some Romeo passing through
may have carried her off.
You speak nonsense!
I’m going mad!
Send out 100 messengers and 1 ,000 musketeers.
Search every hamlet, every vineyard, and every meadow – but bring her back!
- Dead or alive?
- Alive, you fool!
This is too much to bear!
What about the wedding?
Postpone it.
No wedding, no banquet, no decorations, no cake, no bells!
Leave me in peace, and do not disturb me again until you’ve found her.
I will not be consoled... except by her presence.
Be gone!
Oh, she’s disgusting!
Oh, she’s dirty!
Oh, she’s filthy!
The poor thing
She must be sick
They say her skin
hides some disease
Maybe the mange
Just look at her
You can’t tell her hands
from her face
With that hair all over
How disgusting
She won’t have a chance
to see the prince
Before kissing her,
he’d have to wash her
She must smell foul
from head to toe
The old woman said
you must clean
The stables and the barn
- Do you know why?
- How would I know?
Our prince is coming Sunday
He’s a stickler
for cleanliness
- Not like her
- She’s disgusting
Let’s get away from here
She infests the air
They say she’s evil
You’d better hide
If the prince sees you,
he might have you driven off
You won’t be allowed
at the feast
The king’s soldiers
might take you for a beast
And kill you
I won’t take up much room
nor make any noise
But I want to see
the prince go by
Then I’ll leave
She wants to see the prince!
They’ll all take flight
at such a sight
What is your name,
noble lady?
They call me Donkey Skin
- Is it your skin that stinks ?
- I think it’s her body
I’ve never seen
anything so hideous
Am I really guilty?
What crime have I committed?
I don’t deserve
such a miserable life
Unless a Prince Charming
comes for me
I vow here and now
to go out and find him
Are we almost there?
Almost, sire.
You’ve eaten nothing, sire.
I’m not hungry.
Is something bothering you?
I was thinking how odd the world is.
They say it may stop turning.
The fairies will start it up again.
- I don’t believe in them.
- I do.
Fairies are an unseen force that drive us to act for good... or evil.
Excuse me.
I need peace and quiet.
- I’ll go with you.
- I didn’t say I needed company.
Love hides within the heart
Like a thief
And secretly plans
The heart’s downfall
Like a worm inside a cherry
Recalling happy days
Are you bored , Prince?
Never, Rose.
There’s so much to do, to discover, to understand.
You sang of love.
Is it love you seek?
Of course... like everyone else.
Then follow the path.
You need only trust.
Thank you, Rose.
Love, love, I love you so
Love, love, I love you so
Why do you knock
at a time like this?
I’ve waited so long
For you to bring me
happiness
Love, love, I love you so
Tell me, woman, who’s that princess in the forest?
- Princess? That’s a scullery maid, sire.
- She has the loveliest face.
Little Red Riding Hood, perhaps!
She’s a lowly servant.
They call her Donkey Skin due to that carcass on her back.
- Donkey Sin?
- Donkey Skin!
Donkey Skin.
What a lovely name!
Kind sir... the wine and sun here have muddled your senses.
I haven’t tasted your wine, and the sun shone only to lead me to her.
You have a mysterious expression, sire.
- I just saw an angel.
- Goodness me!
Let them hang me
If I didn’t dream it
I wonder
If I haven’t found
Love in my path
Love that makes
the wisest men go mad
I seemed to recognize
Love’s features
Such youth
Such grace, such beauty
Such tenderness
Such serenity
My life depends upon her
I shall live for her alone
Her love
Must belong to me
I’d given up hope
I was driven to despair
I went on living joylessly
Then she appeared
Lovelier than an angel
Come down among us men
I’d give my life for her
Even if I were hanged
I must see her again
I do not wish to die
Of love
- You’ re trembling, sire.
- There’s a spell upon him.
Yes... and what joy!
Prepare the horses.
We’re leaving.
Were you asleep?
I thought I heard sounds from your room.
We weren’t expecting you until tomorrow.
That’s not a rebuke, but you know how I worry when you’re on the road.
Did you have a good trip?
What’s that mean?
It means Father should do something about his kingdom.
There are still scullery maids living in huts.
Take that up with your father.
You look troubled.
Are you ill?
I rode 50 leagues.
I’m tired.
- You’re burning up.
- I’m exhausted.
You gallop like mad.
You have a fever.
Are you ill?
Just my luck.
For your return, I’ve arranged the Ball of the Cats and the Birds.
The Marquis of Carabas will attend.
Every princess will be rushing here to see you.
You hear me?
Shall I call a doctor?
No! Thank you.
Leave me now.
I need to rest.
Where’s that son of yours?
Must we beg him to appear?
I’ve sent for him three times.
Does he know this ball is in his honor?
Yes. He says he doesn’t feel well.
- Where is he?
- He refuses to leave his room.
That isn’t like him.
Does he have some secret?
Not that I know of.
- Has he eaten?
- He didn’t touch his food.
- I’ll go get him.
- No, I’ll go.
Mademoiselle de Ségur has inquired about you.
Mademoiselle de Clèves traveled four days.
They’re all clamoring to see you.
I don’t care about those silly wenches.
I wish only to see that girl.
I have to marry her.
I assure you she’s a scullery maid.
And I assure you she’s a great beauty.
Your absence is already the cause of many rumors.
If you tell them you wish to marry a scullery maid, they’ll lock you up.
You’re right.
But I must find a way to see her.
And I won’t leave this room until I do.
I’ll lie sick in bed.
I have spoken.
What did you say?
Your Majesty.
Leave us, Godefroy.
The king is concerned about you.
- He needn’t be.
- You haven’t eaten a bite.
- I have no appetite.
You left the hunt early, you wouldn’t attend the play, and now you refuse to come to the ball.
Everything seems to bore and annoy you.
Is there nothing I can do to lift your spirits?
Now that you mention it, there’s just one thing that could lift my spirits.
Just name it.
You know I couldn’t refuse.
A cake made by Donkey Skin.
Who?
Donkey Skin.
You don’t know her.
But you aren’t even hungry!
Don’t argue.
It’s the only thing I really want.
My wish may seem banal, but it’s as good as anything else.
A cake?
Donkey Skin, you say?
- Yes.
Donkey Skin.
Get some rest, my child.
Thibaud, I wish to ask you a question.
- A riddle?
- I said a question.
Do you know Donkey Skin?
Your Majesty, there’s no uglier creature in the world.
And she stinks to high heaven!
Who is she?
A filthy thing that lives on one of your farms and keeps the pigs.
Filthy or not, go at once.
The prince demands she make him a cake.
I won’t get there before daybreak.
All the more reason to hurry.
Hurry... yes... right.
This girl must be quite a cook!
Here we are.
- Are you Donkey Skin?
- Yes, sir.
I am the queen’s overseer.
The prince, who must be ill, requests a quake –
I mean, a cake made by you.
Do you have all you need?
- Yes, sir.
Then hurry, wench.
We’ll be waiting.
I hope she washes her hands.
A cake for the prince.
My cookbook!
Apple savarin, rum pastry, walnut delight, royal cream puffs – no.
Apricot cobbler, plum soufflé... strawberry shortcake, pineapple charlotte.
Ah... a love cake!
My dress the color of the sun!
Prepare...
Prepare your dough
In a shallow...
In a shallow bowl
And without further ado
Light your oven
Then take...
Then take some flour
And pour it...
And pour it in the bowl
Four generous handfuls
And make a little. . .
A little well in the center
Then choose four. . .
Choose four fresh eggs
Laid this very. . .
Laid this very morning
Because 20 days later
A chick is bound. . .
A chick is bound to appear
A whole bowl. . .
A whole bowl of milk
Nice and creamy. . .
Nice and creamy,
if you please
Sprinkle with sugar
And then mix. . .
And then mix it well
A handful of sweet butter
A pinch of. . .
A pinch of leavening
A drop of honey
And a dash of. . .
And a dash of salt
And now it’s time
While kneading the dough
To slip in a present
For your be. . .
For your betrothed
Make a lover’s wish
While the dough is resting
Butter the dish
And let it bake. . .
And let it bake one hour
The donkey skin!
Get up, lazybones.
Wake up. You mustn’t keep the prince waiting.
Hurry up.
- How is he?
- Impossible to say.
He’s delirious, yet he has no fever.
Are there no fairies around?
They’re all busy.
It’s the full moon.
But you’re men of science!
We never saw a case like this at school.
The cake, Your Majesty.
- What do you think?
- You know I don’t like cake.
What do you think?
It smells like good butter.
Excellent.
Here, my child.
Taste it when you’re good and ready.
I’m not very hungry.
He shouldn’t gobble it like that.
He’ll get air in his blood.
He’s choking!
Do something!
He’s been poisoned!
He hasn’t eaten in three days.
Get him some water.
Thank you all.
The cake was delicious.
I feel much better.
I’d like to sleep now.
You may go.
We mustn’t upset him.
His mysterious illness seems marked by constant fluctuations.
His cough will subside shortly.
I knew not
that you loved me
Are you certain of it now?
A golden ring told me so
There must be a spell on us
But what will we do
with so much happiness?
Show it to the world
or conceal it?
We will build a life together
Like no others have ever built
Our love will be a legend
And we will live long
in memory
But what will we do
with so much love ?
Show it to the world
or conceal it?
We’ll do
all that is forbidden
We’ll go together
to the snack bar
We’ll smoke a pipe
in secret
We’ll stuff ourselves
on cake
But what will we do
with so much joy?
This world
is overflowing with it
We’ll do
all that is forbidden
We’ll go together
to the snack bar
We’ll smoke
a pipe in secret
We’ll stuff ourselves
on cake
But what will we do
with so much joy?
This world
is overflowing with it
We’ll have
a great many children
And our life together will be
An enchanted fairy tale
The royal physicians!
Did you consult your books?
Yes, Your Majesty, and we all agree on the diagnosis.
Tell us.
The prince is dying of love.
- Love?
- I knew it.
What do you advise?
Marriage, Your Majesty.
Is it urgent?
The sooner the better.
Thank you for your wise counsel.
We will reflect on the matter.
I refuse to handle this matter.
You must do it.
As you wish.
Wait. I’ll go with you.
My dear son!
My dear child!
- We know everything.
- You’re lucky.
You shall have her, no matter how hideous or stupid.
- Let’s not get carried away.
- You promised.
Tell us her name.
I don’t wish to distress you, but I can’t even tell you her name.
Look.
I shall marry the girl who can wear this ring.
What’s that ring?
Who gave it to you?
- No, no questions.
- But we could –
- No, I know you!
If I tell you this much, you’ll want her whole genealogy.
Then I shall command all the ladies to come –
To try the ring on.
Thank you.
"By order of the king!
All maidens are to come to the palace to try on a ring.
But remark well: maidens only!
The one whom the ring fits perfectly will marry the prince, heir to the throne.
Know ye further that said ring is very small, and the finger in question must be slender."
Come hither, ladies
This elixir of gazelle milk
will make your finger so slender
That you will wed the prince
This way, my beauties
I’ll make your finger slender
and smoother than a plum
And the prince
will fall head over heels
I have a miracle salve
To make our fingers slender
Quick, let’s open it
And rub it in well
Push harder, lazybones!
I’m afraid of hurting you
Are you stupid
or just pretending?
Tighten
until I tell you to stop!
Mother, hurry
The prince awaits
My finger’s growing thinner
Mine will fit the golden ring
My skin’s peeling off!
Mine is down to the bone !
Serves you right
You featherbrains!
The fake ! The quack!
Just look at my finger!
It looks terrible
Look at mine
It’s twice as fat as it was
- They’re so silly!
- He’s jealous
All that
just to marry a prince!
You’re just a cruel scamp
Ouch!
You’re pinching me!
- Help!
- What is it, Esther?
- I cut myself
- Serves her right
Make him go away!
Beauty has its price
Princesses first... then duchesses fallow –
I mean, follow – then marchionesses.
What a crowd!
What if it fits several of them?
No chance of that.
But what if it does?
It’s true.
I hadn’t thought of that.
Calm down! There’s no hussy –
I mean, no hurry.
And please don’t push!
I said countesses, and then behinds –
I mean, baronesses – behind them.
Sorry.
It’s well-known I have the slenderest finger in the county.
Next.
Come back in a few years.
With pleasure,
Your Highness.
Almost, but not quite.
Maids and chambermaids first, then cooks.
Kitchen hands and turkey keepers last.
Stop your crackling –
I mean, your cackling!
Miss Gauthier, servant in the castle.
Miss Nicolette, cook.
Miss Salt-and-Pepper, turkey keeper.
Miss Glumcakes, no occupation.
I doubt it’s even worth trying, sire.
Give me your hand.
No, the other one.
I told you so.
Is there no one else?
No, Your Highness.
There’s no one else,
Your Majesty.
My dear child... every lady of the realm answered your summons.
None could wear the ring.
I am very sorry.
I’m quite surprised, because this ring must belong to someone.
Come to think of it,
I don’t think I saw Donkey Skin, the girl who made me the cake.
Did no one inform the girl?
I don’t know, Your Majesty.
Send for her immediately.
Here she is, Your Majesty.
Donkey Skin!
Do you live at the third farm down the road?
Yes, Your Highness.
Show me your hand.
It’s all arranged.
I’m marrying your father.
Try to look pleased.
My daughter.
My dear daughter, here you are.
We’ll never be parted again.
The festivities
lasted almost three months.
Kings came from every land:
the king of India with his elephant,
the king of Africa with his camel,
the king of Siam with his cats,
coaches, and sedan chairs.
They say the couple’s love
would endure even now
if they hadn’t died
a hundred years later.
Our tale is perhaps
difficult to believe...
but as long as there are children
and mothers and grandmothers,
it will live on in memory.
Chas?
Breakfast?
You're up.
Yeah.
You're gonna be late for work, Dana.
Cornflakes or Rice Krispies?
It's all right. I'll get my own.
Oh.
Confirmed bachelor, aren't you?
A fella last night in the club... said that my voice was wasted on cabaret material.
Oh, yeah?
Shall I come over tonight?
I'll call you at the club about 2.
Half past.
- Two?
- Two, or half past.
Morning, Rose.
It's 8:00 in the evening, right?
The kiddies are still viewing, ain't they?
You bastard foreign female.
I mean, there's ketchup all over the screen.
- Geezer's got half his ear hanging off.
- Disgusting.
I mean, how are the kids gonna grow up?
- It's not right.
- Definitely not.
- Where to, Chas?
- The minicab depot.
Put your tie on.
Gentlemen of the jury...
I would solemnly suggest to you that what are really on trial here today... are the ethics of a community.
Our national economy, even our national survival... devolves upon the consolidation, by merger... of the smaller and weaker economic units... with the larger and lustier pillars of our commercial context.
What did I tell you? What did
I tell you? Look at this pigsty.
Correspondence not answered.
- Nothing to do with us.
- Clear out.
- Shh.
- Hello? Hello?
- I want that pig, Pooley.
- Man, what's it about?
- Are you Pooley?
- Yes, I am.
You're a disgrace, an incompetent disgrace.
- You're not fit to run a...
- Business is business... and progress is progress.
- Where's your brother?
- At the pictures.
- Answer yes or no.
- It's around the office.
- This gentleman...
- Filth and disorder.
You need help. Help and protection.
We offered it, my governor, personally.
You had an appointment.
He waited 15 minutes...
- ...you slag, 15 minutes.
- He checked the letter.
You call this a service to the public?
Look at this equipment.
Not maintained, is it?
You're a technician, Mr. Wilson.
Makes you weep, eh?
Yeah, makes me weep.
- No, don't.
- It's obsolete.
It is alleged by the prosecution... that the dividend of 15 percent... which was declared on the non-voting B shares... was indeed fraudulently designed... solely to expedite this admittedly bold... but in no way unethical, merger.
I say, merger, gentlemen, not takeover.
Words still have meanings... even in our days of the computer.
The question is:
Was my client a party to that fraud?
Innuendo is a method I despise.
Therefore, I say bluntly... that already, you have heard sufficient to point to the responsibility... and guilt of another party.
A guilty man, gentlemen... whose identity I shall not shrink from establishing... in the course of my presentation of the case for the defense.
Hello, Chas.
You be there tomorrow at
Number 11 Monk Street.
Five thirty on the dot.
Do you understand?
Well, son, how was the clientele tonight?
Spot on, Harry, no aggravation.
What about this lawyer guy?
Did you get to see him?
That man, I submit, should be standing... where my unfortunate client now stands.
- I can rely on that, eh?
- It'll be straightened out in the morning.
He's a nutcase. Like all artists.
But I can rely on him.
- I know my...
- Business is business.
And progress is progress.
In the fluid state of business ethics, pertaining today... we must protect the inalienable right of the smaller businessman... to be conjoined in commercial union...
You want to turn off the electricity and cut the gas...
You're worth it. Come on, Greasy.
- Don't you understand?
- Eighty-five pounds.
I've got the new furnace coming in.
I already had to pay it.
Mr. Molloy, you bleeding me white.
- You're wasting my time.
- White as the wall.
Would you like a drink? Huh?
You like it with ice or...?
You stink. You stinking foreign parasite.
- Excuse me.
- Shh. Please, my customers.
Theresa, please hold the door.
You know, I don't think I'm gonna let you stay in the film business.
Ow!
British justice.
Here, what the...?
- Ooh. All right, let's keep our hair on, eh?
- Why?
- Mr. Fraser?
- Yes?
I've got a message for you.
From an old pal.
An old pal and an old partner, who wants you to know, number one... that he's ever so upset about all this aggravation you got.
And number two, don't involve old pals.
Not even a little bit.
- You follow me, Mr. F?
- If you're an emissary... from Mr. Harold Flowers, it would be most improper for us...
Shh, shh, shh. Don't interrupt.
And no subpoenas for old pals, old mate.
And no snide insinuations in court, neither.
Look here. I'm Mr. Fraser's counsel, and I warn...
I know that. Now shut your hole, Mr. Counsel.
- What did you say?
- Do you follow me, Fraser?
- Hole.
- Now let's face it.
They're gonna convict you.
It's better to spend five years of your life... in a nice comfy nick... than the rest of your miserable existence in a filthy wheelchair.
- Are you threatening my client?
- You bet I am, poncey.
Do you follow me, eh?
Boy?
Hmm. I do.
- Yeah. Good.
- Now listen to me.
I must insist you address your remarks to me.
Address my remarks?
Okey-dokey. Why not?
Mr. Butler, we got his address, haven't we?
Why not, Mr. Humphrey?
If he insists.
Best of luck, Mr. Fraser.
You don't intimidate me...
- Nor my client.
- Shh, shh.
- George.
- Fraser.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Easy.
- Good morning, mate.
A tasty finish.
A man of taste.
Looks after his property, your owner, does he?
- Mm!
- Does he?
We've only got a gallon and a half.
Better not waste it, eh?
Well, next time.
The foreign secretary...
Hold up, pal, you'll do yourself a mischief.
This takes me back.
Your old man was a barber, wasn't he, Rosie?
No.
- No, he wasn't.
- Shut your hole, Moody.
No soap on the gentleman's collar.
Sorry, sir, it was an accident.
Hair today and gone tomorrow.
I said shut your bloody hole!
He's a right nut, he is. Isn't he?
Now, I want you to mention what's happened here to your owner.
Tell him I'll be in touch.
The Mississippi Delta, an area of nearly 13,900 square miles...
Trend-setting, sir, what?
I can rely on him.
I can't say more than that, can I?
Thanks, Harry.
Fourteen thousand quid we offered.
I call that equitable.
Three grand a week that boy's grossing, or I'm a communist.
- What's this about?
- Gordon, what we got in that file?
Joey Maddocks, Licensed Betting Office,
469 Fulham Road, acquisition of.
Plus our letters, sir.
Now, what's all this about Joey Maddocks?
- You steaming into that slag?
- Of course not.
He's been invited to join... our associated group of companies, my son.
All he needs, Harry, is a little nudge.
I'll nudge him for you, don't you worry about that, pal.
We've been courteous.
Courteous and generous.
He's an old friend of Chas'.
Good pals, they was.
Like that since they was kids.
Game boy, eh, Chas?
And a blinding left hand.
Bastard. Soon as he come into the poxy business, he...
- Now, now, calm down, Chas.
- Come on, Harry. You know I'm...
He's a lying slag, he's a grass, and you know it.
Come on, son. Water under the bridge, that is.
- You know what I mean, Harry.
- All right, all right.
Well, tomorrow he learns... what's true and what's not.
Like small businesses in this day and age...
- ...he's against nature.
- Lovely, Harry, I'll learn him.
No. Rosie's gonna handle this part of nonsense.
I want that shop redecorated tomorrow night.
Get the Brown boys, they like a laugh.
- Mad Cyril?
- Why not?
What?
- Pop in, pop out.
- Absolutely.
You know what I mean? Be...
Placatory. Of course.
- Hold on, Harry.
- I like that, Gordon. Turn it up.
You want him to stay on and manage...?
Of course we do.
His name stays over the door if he wants.
- Right under ours.
- Let me see to the ponce, Harry.
I'll decorate him and his shop.
Don't you ever listen to a word I say?
Keep personal relations out of business.
- Excuse me, but...
- Out!
Aye.
Right, your relations with
Joey was double-personal.
Right?
Right then. And what's my other thing I say?
My motto?
At the death, who is left holding the sodding baby?
No, go on, what else?
Harry Flowers.
Right again.
Me.
Me.
Me.
Me.
All right. At ease, gentlemen.
Anyone for a nightcap?
- We need a signed statement.
- What for?
Containing your allegations against Mr. Flowers.
- Allegations?
- Allegations.
Found it outside. Clean it.
Lots of filth around.
Yeah, cheers, Steve. Uh, listen...
I'm not making actual allegations.
I can't do that.
Well, I mean, I...
I got no proof, have I?
Looks like you've got a war on your hands, Joey.
I'll give a grand... if I could get that Mr. Harry
"Pervert" Flowers... right here, right now.
I'll give a grand in readies.
Dirty degenerate.
Will I do?
What?
I'd have rung up first, Joey, but your lines is always busy.
All five of them.
- Let's go.
- What do you mean?
Harry Flowers is waiting for you.
That geezer, that's the one, isn't it?
- Eh, Joey?
- You stay out of this.
Hold up, that was him that left with him.
Look at this Vietnam strife.
Down with red tape, eh?
No taxman around here, my son.
But, Harry, I'm still a bit worried about my future.
Worried? That I will not allow, my son.
Anyone worries you, you tell me about it.
You're on the firm now, Joey.
One of me own.
United we stand, divided we're lumbered.
Took over? No, Joey.
The word is "merged."
You was merged, my son.
To old England.
Jack, tell Chas to come over and have one with us, eh?
- Yeah, sure, Harry.
- Harry, that shop...
- Exactly.
- Listen, no, it's my whole life, Harry.
Exactly, Joey. Mine too. Mine too.
Speaking of which, Dennis...
I'm not at all happy about the tactless manner... which Joey was brought here in.
Chas, I told you not to bother
Mr. Maddocks, didn't I?
A whiskey, please, Dave.
- Right away, Chas.
- Oh, was I tactless?
Making him say that thing about his poor dead father? My God.
- Let's take this chat upstairs, shall we?
- Who do you think you are?
The Lone Ranger?
- I know who I am, Harry.
- Of course you do, son.
You're Jack the Lad.
I've known a few performers in my time.
But I tell you this, he's got the gift, boy.
- Right, Denny?
- He enjoys his work.
- That's the half of it.
- Do you think he does, Denny?
- Oh, I do. I get a load of kicks out of it.
- Which can be a good thing, Chas.
Putting a little stick about.
Putting the frighteners on flash little twerps.
But it can also be a tricky thing.
And I'll tell you why.
Because you can get to enjoy your work too much, my son.
And it can slip your mind that... you're bloody working for me, you berk!
And when I say me, I mean...
Tell him what I mean, Jack.
- You mean, um, you, Harry.
- No.
- The business.
- The business.
- That's what he means.
- Correct him one.
In which you're a cog, boy.
A cog in an organ.
- Go to hell, Dennis. I know what I am.
- It's the business of business... to push the buttons.
And I'm alive and well.
You push the buttons on that thing.
Right. We push them. Us.
This terrific democratic organization. Right, Joey?
- Right, Harry.
- Same again. All around, Dave.
- Let me do this one, Harry.
- The world's a dodgy place, my friends.
I can't help that.
But we've got progress.
Look at the Yanks.
- The New World.
- Organization.
Listen, Chasm.
That boy's in bother.
Up here.
He's an ignorant boy.
An out-of-date boy.
Let go.
Get it. Get it.
Come on, Joey.
Come on, you slick...
Hold his arms now.
That's it. Hold him.
Go on then.
Come on, Brien. Give us a hand over here.
Shall I...? Shall I decorate him, eh, Joey?
No. No. I'm not one of those.
I'm not him.
- You love that, don't you?
- You little twerp.
You vicious little twerp!
Say it!
Say it.
Say it.
Say it.
Come on! Say it!
Chas, say it.
I am...
Yes!
He's out, Joey.
Get some water. Water.
- Give him the kiss of life, Joey.
- You shut your filthy mouth!
Chas.
Look.
Chas.
You remember me, Chas.
We...
Listen, look...
Do you remember Mick?
Remember?
Chas, what's the point... of this?
You can't do that.
I am a bullet.
Oh, God, my chest hurts.
Look what you've done.
Help me.
You're dead, Joey.
You can stay... yesterday... until... tomorrow.
Get out of my flat.
Hey, you!
Just a minute.
Don't you bloody move.
Harry, I won't mince words.
You're more than involved.
You're incriminated.
Look at the facts.
- The facts.
- One...
I'll tell you the facts.
Business facts.
Soon as they pick up Devlin, they'll be all over us, my friends.
Press, taxman, copper, the lot.
You know what they're gonna call us?
They'll call us gangsters.
- It'll be goodbye to business.
- We'll be as popular as Hitler.
I know you would, pal. I know.
Well, I just don't know anywhere, mate. But honestly...
- Where is he?
- We're looking, Harry.
Six figures a year, we're into. Six figures.
And now this little bastard...
He's put us in the stuck.
Pity he exists.
I never sent him. It was me told him not to go.
Don't get your personal relations mixed up in my business.
- I told him.
- Told him? Oh, that's a joke.
Like telling a mad dog who to bite, that is.
I was bitten by a dog once.
When I was a kid.
- It was a wirehaired terrier.
- Harry, I'm your legal adviser.
You could be charged with conspiracy to murder.
Hello?
Hello? Can I speak to Mr. Flowers?
- Hello, Chas.
- Is Harry there?
Yes, Chas, of course he's here.
Harry, it's Chas.
Hello, Chas. Are you hurt bad?
Not too bad. You know already, eh?
It was just, uh...
Just an accident.
Harry, I've gotta get off the street.
Yes, Chas.
Yes, all right.
We'll try to work something out.
Harry, you know I'd never lumber you.
It's down to me this aggravation, but I've gotta get in.
Where are you?
Chas, hold on a minute.
He's at Wandsworth Bridge Road.
Moody?
What?
What would you do, Moody?
Me?
With a mad dog, Moody?
When a poor sick animal is liable to bite you?
Bite me?
Without meaning to.
I'd put him to sleep, Dennis.
Harry? Hello?
Hello?
Hello? Harry?
I don't need the details, my son.
Off you... Off you go.
I can rely on him.
I can't say more, can I?
He's an artist, eh?
My bath's running.
I can't explain now, Mom, but it's as bad as can be. Now listen...
- But, Charlie...
- Now listen, Mom.
- But where are you, Charlie?
- I must go away.
Now. Right away.
I might go to Aunt Mary.
- Your Aunt Mary?
- Down in Devon.
Yes, go there.
They won't know of her.
Not down in Barnstaple.
- Right.
- Now, behave yourself, mind.
Yeah.
- Give her my love, won't you?
- Okay, thanks.
- Ta-ta, Mom.
- Bye, Charlie.
I said Barnstaple, not Exeter.
I said change at Exeter, mate.
Seven twenty-two. Platform four.
Gets in at 10 past.
One and 10 for sandwich, love.
- Hello, Ma.
- Noel.
Thanks, Ma. You're a darling.
He said, "You call that rock 'n' roll?"
I said, "That's the sound, Mr. Payne.
That's what I'm selling you, man."
He said, "My God, that's a black sound.
It's four times blacker than you."
Liverpool. Tsk.
So I said, "Cool it, man.
Cool it. It's a bad sound."
I'll tell you who comes from Liverpool.
- Mary Tinkling.
- "I'll buy it," he says.
- "You got a gig for six weeks."
- He's a shrewd one, is that.
So Mr. Turner's gonna sublet your room then, is he?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.
I told him.
I said, "Turner, you are my landlord... to which I owe 41 pound back rent... which I will send to you from Liverpool pretty soon."
He said, "Yeah?" So I said,
"Listen. Listen, baby.
All my things.
All my gear, all my sounds, my big horn. Everything.
My whole life stays right here... at 81 Powis Square in this little basement room."
He says, "Okay, my son, go."
I should try to find a cool subtenant... who has respect for another person's life.
That Turner, drug addict.
- Come on, Mom. He's just like...
- He's peculiar.
He's peculiar. He's a hermit.
He can't face reality.
That's what it is.
A world of their own, these kids.
Powis Square, Notting Hill Gate.
This is a recording.
Speak now what you want.
Hello, is Mr. Turner there?
Speak on the third peep.
- Peep. Peep. Peep.
- Oh, uh...
Uh, I'm a...
I'm a friend of Noel's.
An old friend.
It's about the room.
- So...
- The basement room.
I've just seen him off actually.
Me and his mom.
Oh, good morning. Are you there?
I'm a bit on the early side.
You've got the wrong house, mister.
- Fruit off.
- No, listen.
- I've got it right here.
- Right where?
- The back rent. It's 41 pound, right?
- Mm.
He said, "Just settle up with Mr. Turner and the room's yours, pal."
- Stroke of luck, eh?
- You think so?
I'm in the entertainment business. You know... show business. And I saw
Noel at the railway...
Hello? Hello?
Oh, yes, yes. Is that you?
- Yes.
- The basement room, in the basement.
That's it, dear. That's it. Yeah.
- Down the back stairs.
- Yeah.
Push!
Do it again a bit longer.
- Hello.
- I didn't recognize your voice.
- No?
- No.
Oh, no. I've been away, haven't I?
And I don't recognize your face.
My face?
Oh, uh...
Well, you should see the motor.
- See the what?
- My motor.
We had a little argument with a cement wall on the way up from Dover.
Goodbye, the Ferrari.
It's down here, right?
First left I think he said.
Oh, my mistake.
Goodbye, the Rolls Royce.
I know what you mean.
Look after my gear, pal.
My big horn.
Yeah, there I was just back from the continent... from a continental tour and this had to happen.
Oh, very nice.
It's characteristic.
I'll take it.
Uh-huh.
Dean's the name. Johnny Dean.
Look, regards from Noel.
I got 41 pounds for you.
I owe it to him actually... but that's another story, and I won't bore you with it.
So, uh, a week in advance will be, uh...
Sixty-six pounds.
- Sixty-six pounds.
- Plus... one week deposit on the fittings and the fixtures... plus, I should have a banker's reference.
Listen, uh, that's, uh...
Extortionate?
- Of course.
- Uh, well, uh, I'd say that was...
- One hundred and thirty-two pounds.
- Oh.
How do you entertain?
- I juggle.
- Juggle?
Juggle, juggle. I've got a load of bookings here in London.
They're all A-one venues.
- No luck, have I?
- No.
Hey, Mom, when's Christmas?
Goodbye, the Ferrari.
You're pissed.
- Hey.
- Oh! You've had one over the eight.
No, I haven't.
I'm the new lodger.
Do you want an aspirin?
- Want a cup of tea?
- Yeah, that'll be lovely.
- Have you got some turps?
- Turps?
- Do you wanna earn a bob?
- Two bob, mate.
All right.
Go and buy me a bottle of turpentine.
Five bob, mate.
Half a dollar.
Okay.
So I say to this guy at the office:
"Why are you so mean?"
- And he just say, "Your visa is finished."
- Please.
"And... And you're... You're not in a place of learning, right?"
Right.
"And you've got...
And you've got to get out of the British Kingdom...
...and to go back to France."
That's really insanity.
You poor little thing.
When was all this?
I don't know.
Last week I think it was.
Last month.
So I say:
"Pherber is teaching me
English, you know... and that his boyfriend is learning me his books... and everything...
My magic stories!"
First thing in the bloody morning.
And then he asks me,
"Where are you living?"
- I say, "I don't remember."
- I've got a crippled tap dancer... in my bloody basement.
- He said, "This is very illegal."
- Yeah, he said that.
So I said, "The Hilton Hotel."
Listen, I don't want any more bums in my basement.
A juggler, madam.
- I don't want her.
- Juggler.
- I don't want her.
- You'd love her.
Yeah, you might like her.
You'd love him.
Do you think I should wash my hair?
Mm-mm. No.
"You juvenile in moral danger."
- Go on.
- "And you're not desirable."
So I said, "You stupid shit."
And I spit and I ran away.
Well, just when I got my skull completely empty.
Shower?
Plus banker's deposit.
Plus money for fixtures and fittings.
So I didn't get my visa.
Plus references for one week.
- Well, I'm not worried.
- Plus one week on account... that makes 167 pounds.
Here, give it to me.
I'll do it. I'll do it.
- Oh, they'll never find me.
- There you are. Beautiful.
- I'm not worried.
- Nope, you shouldn't worry.
Anyone want a cup of tea?
Where's my porridge, Lorraine?
Tony! Your uncle for you!
Put them over there, mate.
Oh, yeah.
- Chas?
- What's happening in the outside world?
Ain't you seen the papers yet, mate?
- No, I haven't bothered.
- They've really gone to town on you, son.
- You are the front page.
- Oh, yeah?
- What else?
- Well, I've had the filth.
And I've had the firm. Well, the law, that was nothing.
But your friend, Rosybloom, he's funny, isn't he?
- No aggravation?
- No, no.
But stand on me, uncle.
It weren't your welfare he was on about.
Actually... he's obviously very, very deeply involved with Noel.
I don't want any invalid... washed-up cabaret artists in my beautiful basement, sir.
Tony, I'm getting out.
Out of the country.
Out of the country?
Now listen, Tone.
I'm gonna tell you where I keep my rainy-day money.
You shoot too much of that shit, Pherber.
Too much vitamin B12 has never hurt anybody.
Behind the boiler, you mean?
Well behind. Persevere.
There's two grand in that bag, Tone.
First off, I want you to nick a drink for yourself. Five hundred quid.
You're a gentleman, Chas.
No, I want you to have it.
You and Marge.
Now second off...
I've gotta get a passport.
There's a geezer...
Have you got a pencil?
Cypriot geezer. His name is Thanopoulos.
Hey, Johnny, Mom says do you want an egg?
You got that, Tone? Goodbye.
And Turner says will you come up and see him, please.
All right, Lorrie. I'll be up.
- What a freak show.
- Where are you then?
Oh, you know, on the left.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- I'll tell you this, Tony.
It's a right pisshole.
Long hair... beatniks... druggers, free love... foreigners, you name it.
But I'm not bothered,
Tone. I'm well in.
And you couldn't find a better hidey-hole.
In you go, Dad.
Afternoon, Mr. Turner.
Good afternoon, Mr., uh...
There's been a mistake.
You can't have the room.
What?
It's not for rent.
Wait a minute.
The lady just said...
The lady said?
I don't tell her everything.
She's my secretary.
I got a lot of work to do.
Under a lot of pressure.
Here.
No, I don't want it.
That carpet's 200 years old.
It looks it.
A valuable antique, is it?
Listen, I got to say goodbye now.
Mr. Turner, I've got all my luggage, my stage gear... it's all coming here from the continent.
Your what?
My luggage. My juggling, you know, stuff.
Why don't you go to a hotel?
A hotel? You must be joking.
Look, I need a...
I need a bohemian atmosphere.
I'm an artist, Mr. Turner.
Like yourself.
- You juggle?
- Why not?
Why, why not? Why not a jongleur?
It's the third oldest profession.
You're a performer of natural magic.
I... I perform.
I bet you do.
I can tell by your vibrations... you're the anti-gravity man!
Amateur night at the Apollo.
Cheops in his bloody pyramid.
He dug a juggler or two, didn't he? Remember?
And the tetrarchs of Sodom... and Orbis Tertius.
Am I right? Am I right, babe?
More or less.
Personally, I just, you know... perform.
Oh, you're a modest chap.
Because after all, there was only one. Only one.
- Only one what?
- And right you are.
Enrico Rastelli.
- You said it all, pal.
- Juggler to the King of Tuscany.
Now, about the room...
Fourteen balls.
How about just on a...
On a nightly basis?
Right. On a nightly basis.
On a horse.
And blindfold.
Talk about a performer.
Of course, I'm not telling you anything you don't know, am I, old man?
You can't stay here, old man.
Not in the mood?
Why don't you play us a tune, pal?
I don't like music.
Comical little geezer.
You'll look funny when you're 50.
You'll have to go.
You wouldn't like it here.
Not like it?
That charming little basement suite?
I paid for it.
I love it.
No.
You wouldn't fit in here.
I would.
I'm determined to fit in.
I've got to fit in, Mr. Turner.
I see.
It's that bad, eh?
I wonder, Mr. Dean... if you were me, what would you do?
I don't know.
It depends.
It depends who you are.
Which I don't know.
Who I am? Do you know who you are?
- Eh?
- Yes.
Well, that simplifies matters.
You can stay.
On a daily basis.
Yesterday till tomorrow, all right?
Thanks.
He wasn't that big.
I remember him quite well.
He was and all.
He was world-famous.
Well, when I was a nipper he was chart-buster.
They come and they go. Pop stars.
He had a following.
I never fancied his stuff, myself.
I fancied him.
Old rubber lips.
He had three number one's... and two number two's and a number four.
Hmm. Fetch that tea over here, Lorrie.
Didn't last though, did it, his success?
- Well, he retired, didn't he?
- Oh, did he?
So, what's he do now then?
He stays... He stays here. He's writing a book and some music.
Oh, yeah? Is that why he's got a secretary?
Huh?
That foreign bird, you know, not the skinny one, the other one.
Pherber? Pherber's his lover, mate.
She cohabits with him since years and years.
- Their love story's famous.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah, you don't know nothing, do you, Dad?
- When's Mom coming?
- Tonight.
That won't fit in, honey.
Look, it's all holes.
That won't fit in.
I know. I know how to do it.
Come on, I know. Here it is.
Look, this is the one.
You're getting fat, Lorraine.
Beans make you fat.
I'm sick of beans.
I don't really like that guy.
I think he's horrible.
You don't really like him, do you?
- What do you want...?
- I don't want anything!
I just let things happen!
Why did Turner let him stay?
- He changed his mind.
- Why?
Why did he let him stay? Why?
- Mr. Dean?
- Hmm?
Would you like me to do your room now?
Oh, hello, Mrs. Gibbs.
No, thanks, dear. No.
Tomorrow will be fine.
Thanks a lot, love. Thank you.
"At this point, something unforeseeable occurred.
From a corner of the room, the old ecstatic gaucho... threw him a naked dagger which landed at his feet.
Dalman bent over to pick it up.
'They would not have allowed such things to happen to me... in the sanitarium,' he thought.
And he felt two things.
- The first...
- Yes.
I know why.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
Ow!
- What is it?
- I got a fly.
A fly?
In my eye.
- Why?
- Because you're afraid of him.
Yes, right.
Right.
And he's afraid too.
Of you?
Blower for you, Tony.
Hello, uncle. How are you?
Not bad, Tony.
Uh, listen, uh, I saw Thanopoulos.
He said, "Okay, yeah."
He can get you on a freighter.
Direct to the big city, New York.
Yeah, it'll cost you though.
This includes seaman's papers, passport, graft to the skipper, all included.
Nine hundred quid.
Nine hundred?
The old robber.
Well, that's his rate.
No, Tony, you done very well.
You done very well.
- Good. When do I go?
- This week. Definitely.
Yeah.
Now listen.
He wants a little picture of you, mate.
Yeah, a little photograph for your passport.
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah, I get you. I get you.
Thanopoulos, he said,
"If your friend's smart... he'll wanna look decidedly different to what he normally does."
Grow a beard.
No, I'll think of something,
Tone. Don't worry.
Right then, I'll hear from you tonight... at my gaff, 9:00, all right?
Chin up, uncle.
The land of opportunity awaits, eh?
- Three years too late.
- You said you wanted it.
I can't afford it.
I'm not sure if I like it, anyway.
I'll keep the frame.
Oh, come on, forget it.
He never buys anything.
Let's go back to Ula's.
Let's go.
Don't.
Oh, there you are.
Sorry to disturb, but has anyone got a sixpence for the phone?
Uh, can I, uh, use the blower up here?
We haven't got a blower up here.
Ha!
What in God's name has he done to his hair?
He's blown it.
Yeah, well, that's it, dear.
- I gotta ring up my agent again.
- Dye.
- I fancied the red.
- No, no, it was the red that was dyed.
- It's dead.
- Dyed.
- Red.
- Dyed it.
Dead.
Red. Red.
Van Gogh, eh?
Oh, no. This is the normal.
- The normal?
- Yeah. I was just having a laugh.
Having a laugh, you see?
With my act. With my image.
- You know what I mean?
- I know exactly what you mean.
Thought you would.
Uh, he reckons, my agent... that, uh, it's time for a change.
It's time for a change.
Well, I can see his point.
Yeah, so can I.
Personally, casting one's mind back.
Yeah?
- I rather liked it.
- The, uh...?
No, you fool. Your act.
Your image.
We just remembered, see.
We've seen it. We caught it in Hamburg.
- Your act.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes, it was fascinating.
- Oh, mushrooms. I like them fried.
Hungry, eh?
Even though, as one artist to another... it is a bit old-fashioned.
Yeah, well, I am a bit old-fashioned.
Or was it Berlin?
No, thanks.
Was it last year? Or was it '67?
- Sixty-six.
- Sixty-nine.
- Was it Paris?
- Goodbye, the Bugatti.
- It was Wembley.
- Why not?
No. Tokyo.
- Tokyo?
- Tokyo. The World's Fair.
Oh, yes. It was Tokyo.
No, thanks.
Yeah, it was Tokyo.
Definitely.
Speaking of which, I just come across downstairs on the floor.
This will sound funny, but have you got one?
A Polaroid?
Time for a change.
Have we got one?
- Yes, no.
- Yes, no.
Just for a lark, I thought, eh?
Little Lorraine set it off.
Gave me the idea.
Yeah, we often lark about with the Polaroid.
- Me and the girls.
- Oh, yeah? I got a Leica N3 myself.
- I never wear hats.
- Not even when performing?
- Never. No.
- What you wear then?
- Look here.
- Uh...
Well, loose... Ah!
Loose things.
Marvelous picture.
Yeah, I never wear hats.
Oh, right, you like the mushrooms fried.
- Sorry.
- No, no. Ah...
Why don't you try this?
- I'll try anything once.
- You'll like it, it's continental.
Yeah, you're a good cook, Pherber.
Are these...?
Are these photographs for narcissistic... or publicity purposes?
What?
Because if you're planning to disseminate postcard-sized...
- Have you got a drop of Scotch?
- No, I'm sorry.
Offset litho reproductions of these by the thousand, then...
Oh, no, no, no.
- These are just for my agent.
- You see my point?
Of course I can. Of course I can.
Oh! no! no, uh...
No, I'd, uh...
I don't want these to be seen by the general public.
- No.
- Good.
That's a load off my mind.
That's a first-class photo,
Turner, technically speaking... but I don't think it's a suitable image.
- You don't?
- No.
I think it's perfect.
Perfectly brown.
It's you.
- Yeah, well, that's it. I don't, uh...
- It's perfect you.
It looks, uh... I look dodgy.
- You know what I mean?
- I know what you mean.
Yeah, you've, uh...
Well, you've gone too far.
He means we haven't really got anywhere.
He means we've got to go much further out.
We have to go much further.
Much further back.
And faster.
Wait a minute.
Are you all right?
Yes.
Yeah, I'm fine, thank you.
Look, what I've got to have is a little photo.
I want a little black and white photo, yeah?
Look, it's just gotta be a little bit different.
Do you know what I mean?
And black and white. Ah.
It's nothing. It's what... The accident what done me up.
You wanted a sort of passport size, eh?
It's interesting how things grow quickly septic.
I think maybe we ought to call Dr. Burroughs.
Give him a shot.
A shot?
No.
No.
You know what you're doing, Pherber.
I've gotta get... I've gotta get this little photo just right.
What photo?
Of who?
Johnny Dean.
Maybe he doesn't know who he is.
He does.
He does. He knows.
He's the bogeyman.
I'm alive and well. You push the buttons on that thing.
We push the buttons.
He's the horror show.
He's an old pro.
He can take it.
He takes it.
He dishes it out too, bet your sweet fucking life he does.
He's a mean bastard.
I'm the Lone Ranger.
He's a striped beast.
You enjoy your work, eh?
You've got the gift.
- What's wrong with the lights?
- Yeah.
Artificial energy.
It's pulsating into the voltage.
The flame... Hey, man, hold it!
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've never seen that sort before.
It must be scorching hot.
This is a...
This is a very pretty table.
A very pretty table.
I... I'd, uh... I'd like a...
How much do you want for this, Turner?
America's a blinding place for nightlife.
He's on his way, that man.
How much did you give him?
Two-thirds of the big one.
That's insane.
I can't make that scene.
You should have thought of that before.
Johnny?
Johnny?
You feel better, huh?
Yeah. Not bad, not had.
Pretty sharp.
- Gotta get a shift on.
- Sure.
Where's Rosie?
Hey. We're gonna nudge that slag.
Don't you worry about that.
Johnny?
Chas?
- Yeah?
- Look at this.
Cor, what a horrible-looking thing.
No, it's not. It's beautiful.
You had one for dinner.
Yeah?
Mm-hm.
- You've poisoned me!
- Look, don't be crazy.
- You poisoned me!
- No!
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
- No, no.
- Just to speed things up.
- You've just been drugged.
I want to get a shift on.
I just wanna go in there, Chas.
You see, the blood of this vegetable is boring a hole.
This second hole is penetrating the hole of your face.
The skull of your bone.
I just wanna get right in there, know what I mean?
- And root around like a mandragora.
- Am I going nuts?
Come on. You're beautiful.
We just dismantled you a little bit, that's all.
Just to see how you function.
We sat through your act. Now you're gonna sit through ours.
His act?
- They never get fed up with it, do they?
- I'm a goer, myself.
Been on the road a million years.
A million years people have been coming and dragging in to watch it.
I like a bit of a cavort.
I don't send them solicitors' letters.
I apply a bit of pressure.
He won't listen to me.
I know how you do it.
I know a thing or two about performing, my boy, I can tell you.
He had the gift too, once upon a time.
You should have seen him 10 years ago.
I'll tell you this.
The only performance that makes it, that really makes it... that makes it all the way, is the one that achieves madness.
Right? Am I right?
- You with me?
- I'm with you.
He wants to know why your show...
- is a bigger turn-on than his ever was.
- How should I know?
Well, I know a thing or two about the clientele.
They're a bunch of liars and wrigglers.
Put the frighteners on them.
Give them a bit of stick.
That's the way to make them jump.
They love it.
Ooh, he's on a bummer.
Time for your new image.
- So is it different?
- Now we're getting somewhere.
America's a blinding place.
Must you really go tomorrow?
Tomorrow. Tomorrow he learns what's true and what's not.
Nothing is true.
Everything is permitted.
Eh?
The last words of the old man in the mountain.
His motto. It's a thousand years old.
Imagine yourself being a thousand years younger.
"The old man was called, in the language of Persia...
Hassan-i-Sabbah.
And his people were called the Hashishin.
He had caused a valley between two mountains... to be enclosed and turned into a garden... so large and beautiful his people believed it was paradise.
And there was a fortress at the entrance... strong enough to resist all the world.
Now, the old man who caused those of his young men... whom he had chosen to be his Hashishin... his assassins, to be given a potion which cast them into a deep sleep.
And to be carried into the garden... so that when they awoke they believed they were in paradise.
And there were damsels and young girls there... who dallied with them to their hearts' content... so that they had what young men desire.
Thus it was, that when the old man decided... to send one of his assassins upon a mission... such as to have a prince slain... he would send for one of these youths and say:
'Go thou and kill... and when thou returnest my angels shall bear thee into paradise.
And shouldest thou die, nevertheless...
I will send my angels to carry you back into paradise."
Enjoy doing work?
Are you in that garden?
Yeah.
Stay there.
Never trust old men, old showmen, old wankers.
I'm gonna take you down the riverside.
I might powder you.
I might polish you. I might make you shiny like a mirror.
I just don't know. Mm.
What's that? What do you call it?
Pectoral.
Do you like my physique?
Yeah, it's in, uh...
It's in good condition.
I've got two angles.
One male and one female.
Just like a triangle, see?
- Did you notice?
- Eh?
Did you never have a female feel?
No, never. I feel like a man.
A man all the time.
That's awful.
That's what's wrong with you, isn't it?
What do you mean?
It's a man's man's world.
There's nothing wrong with me.
I'm normal.
How do you think Turner feels like, huh?
I don't know, he's weird.
And you're weird.
- You're kinky.
- He's a man. Male and female man.
And he feels like me.
- No. No, he doesn't.
- How do I feel, huh?
Tell me. Female feel.
Mm. You love it, hmm?
Come inside my squares.
I'll introduce you to Eek, the light god.
But be fast and change your beautiful dress... or my curiosity will go elsewhere.
Tell me, my gluteus maximus, hmm.
How does it feel like, huh?
- I said I'm not one of those.
- Big butch.
- Mm. Rita Hayworth.
- I said, no.
You're sick.
- Oh!
- You...
You... You degenerate.
- You're perverted.
- Ow!
- What's he wanna get out of my face?
- I'm gonna polish you. Mm.
The hole. The hole.
- What's he want?
- Maybe a little mirror.
- A little dark mirror.
- My mirror? No.
- A little dark mirror.
- No, he shan't. The thieving slag.
Listen!
He won't take it away, you fool.
He just wants to take a look in it.
He's stuck!
- Stuck!
- Why?
Why? Because he's lost his demon. That's why.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
He thought he had it under control.
Juggling all those balls, millions of them.
Bastard.
Until one day he was looking in his favorite mirror... admiring his image, see?
And when suddenly, he saw it a bit too clearly.
And he was just a beautiful, little, freaky, stripy beast, darling.
So he thought maybe...
Maybe it's time for a change, he thought.
Then immediately as he watched, the image faded.
His demon had abandoned him. Puff!
- He was gone.
- Yeah?
He's still trying to figure out whether he wants it back.
- He's gotta find it again. Right?
- Listen, I gotta tell you something.
Go and tell Turner.
He's waiting for you.
He's been waiting a long, long time.
You must be polite.
Eh?
Right again. Me.
Me.
Me.
Do you call that equitable?
I like that. Turn it up.
It was Mad Cyril.
We've been courteous.
Let's have a look.
Let's have a look.
- Excuse me, but...
- Come in!
Take them off. Take them off!
Here's to good old England.
Go and tell your agent.
Why? What time is it?
You forgot to phone your agent.
Uh...
I... I forgot.
You forgot to phone him.
These two freaks with shiny eyes like this:
And that guy like this:
You've been giving him a hard time, haven't you?
Did you screw him?
Hey, what is this?
Do you want it? It's yours.
You can have it.
Yeah?
Is he a real gangster? Is he?
No.
- Mm.
- Mm.
You done me up.
- I forgot, didn't I?
- Hmm?
He's got my passport.
He's got my...
- Hello?
- Tony?
Hello?
Hang on.
- There you go.
- Hey, Tony.
Hello, pal. Where you been?
You forgot.
Oh, Christ almighty.
No, I had a bit of aggravation, Tone.
It wasn't easy. I've got the picture. I've got it right here.
Oh, that's great, great.
Uh, look, that ship.
It looks as if it's leaving tomorrow night. Yeah.
So, uh, I just need the photo.
Yeah, well... you got to pick it up.
Yeah, let me think.
81 Powis Square, Notting Hill Gate.
He can come here.
81 Powis Square, Notting Hill Gate.
81 Powis Square, Notting Hill Gate.
Yes, Chas, yeah.
You'll pick it up at 9:30.
I'll pick it up at 9:30.
Are you all right, boy?
No, no, no, I'm all right, Chas.
I'm just feeling a bit, uh, tired, that's all.
Uh, Tony, uh...
I owe you for this.
I'm going to miss you, Tone.
Yeah, I'll miss you too, boy.
Well, um... Well, good night.
Good night. I'll call you at 9.
- God bless.
- Thanks, Tone.
Thank you, Tony.
A wise head on... Still on those young shoulders, eh?
Ah. So he forgot, did he?
Forgot but not forgiven, eh, Moody?
Pardon?
It's funny. Wouldn't you say that was unlike him, Tony?
It's unlike him to forget an important thing.
Why is he going to America?
Why? I don't know.
Place to go, isn't it, for gangsters?
I don't think so.
He's going to get in some bad scenes again.
He should go here. Look.
Hmm?
The mountains of Persia.
Yeah, maybe. Maybe you're right.
I'm sure there's some bandits over there.
- Don't you think?
- Mm, could be.
Yeah, I'll tell him.
I'll tell him.
Tell me something.
Do you think the mountains would be improved without the bandits?
Mm.
Oh, my God.
I feel like I've been through a cement mixer.
- French, eh?
- Yes, I'm French.
- You're a funny little frog.
- Yes.
- You've got small titties, eh?
- Yes.
A bit underdeveloped?
Yes. What does that mean?
You're very skinny. Like a little boy or something.
Some they mistake this.
Mm.
Lousy morning.
This is for you. I found it.
- It's an amethyst.
- Yes.
It's a purple amethyst.
Yeah.
You can have this too.
This is a magic one.
Oh.
Is it?
Thanks.
Pherber's got a visa.
They don't wanna give you a visa?
- No.
- Why not?
Uh-.
I don't know why not.
Because you're foreign.
He likes foreign birds, that Turner.
Maybe I go with you. Why not?
But I don't want to go to America.
I wish you'd be a bandit in Persia.
- What's your name?
- Lucy.
He's got talent.
He shouldn't have retired.
He should keep at it.
He's stuck.
Everyone knows who he is still, don't they?
He likes you.
Stay till tomorrow.
I can't. I got to go along in a little while.
I've got to go too.
Maybe Pherber will come with me.
For holidays.
In the mountains.
Oh, merde, shampoo.
It's upstairs in the bathroom.
I'll get it for you.
Thanks.
Ah.
We've got to get off, Chas.
Harry's waiting for you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Some of the chaps come up to see you too.
To see how you are.
Rosie, I've got to pop upstairs for a second.
No.
We've not got time.
We've got to get down to the country.
We got time.
We got a minute.
Else you'll have to give it to me right here.
Right here.
Won't you, Rosie?
All right. Make it two minutes.
You'll let me have the shooter as soon as you come down.
Right?
Right.
There's a couple of chaps on the roof, Chas.
A couple in the garden.
I've got to be off now.
No, I'm gonna talk to you some more.
No, I gotta shoot off now.
I might come with you, then.
You don't know where
I'm going, pal.
I do.
I don't know.
Yeah, you do.
Chas.
Chas.
Hello, Chas.
"you are here."
I'm where?
freshman! let's get him! help! Help!
Seniors! freshman. hey, freshie! we got another freshman!
Please, put me down! Help!
Please, I'll be late for my first class.
What do we do with him?
Stuff him in a locker.
No, not the locker.
Anything but the locker!

Whom you will be interested to learn,
Wrote his greatest symphony
At a time when he was completely deaf,
A feat which was practically unheard of
At the time.
I know that most of you are used to listening
To a very different kind of music,
But I hope that when you hear
The immortal strains of Beethoven’s fifth symphony,
You will realize what a work of genius it really is.

Hey, Kate,
I'm getting some static.
Not as much as you're going to get.
So, this is the type of behavior that I can expect.
The minute there's not a teacher in the room,
The entire school erupts
Into a shameless display of adolescent abandon.
If it's discipline that you students need,
I am the one who can provide it for you.
Well, now,
I'm not interested in punishing anyone,
But I think for the good of the whole school,
The person responsible for this deviation from the schedule
Should step forward.
Kate, what are you doing?
What is your name?
Kate Rambeau.
And who are you?
I'm Riff Randell, rock-'n'-roller.
Obviously you do not know who I am.
I am Miss Togar,
And I am the new principal of this school.
(whoop over pa) 
I want you to go to your classes... Now.
This incident is going down on your permanent record,
A record that's going to follow you
Throughout your entire life.
You have managed to upset the entire school
With this godforsaken noise.
Noise? That's the Ramones' best album.
Number one with a bullet.
Randell, I want to see both of you in detention center
Before the next bell, or else.
Oh, Riff, detention center?
I've never served a detention before.
Oh, don't worry.
I've done more detentions than anyone in the school's history.
Whoo-hoo! Come on, Kate.
Loosen up.
Oh, Riff, not that stuff.
Oh, come on. It's not the end of the world.
Yahoo! Detention.
I can't believe you. oh, boy, detention with my best friend.
I don't understand it.
I mean, I'm captain of the football team...
...My complexion has cleared up,
And soon, I'm gonna be going to the college of my choice.
Why don't girls go for me?
Hi, Tom.
Hey, Cheryl, how ya doin'? Ah.
Nice weather we been havin', huh?
Little dry lately, though,
But I hear it's raining cats and dogs in Idaho.
Sure, Tom. Be seeing you?
All right.
What went wrong?
Maybe I'm too forward.
Hi, Tom.
Hey, Shawn, baby, how you doin'?
¿qué pasa?
Nice weather we been havin'' lately, huh?
It's been a little dry, though.
I hear it's been raining cats and dogs in Idaho.
Yes!
See ya later, Tom.
Yes. What happened?
What went wrong?
O caring football type, captain of the team--
I gotta get myself together.
I need to improve my self-image.
I need to broaden my horizons!

Um... Sexual.

Have a seat.
So what'll it be for the star quarterback of Vince Lombardi high?

Uh, no.
Hall pass? Test answers?
No, no, that's not gonna solve my problem.
Shoot. It's been like this all morning,
Ever since Togar took office.
The whole school's in turmoil! Well, look.
Look at this.
Fake ids down 50%.
Test answers down 60%.
Hall passes are fallin'' off the board.
Let's get back to you.
Tell me exactly what you want out of life.
I want someone with huge breasts.
The sweet stirring of passionate youth.
I wanna get laid before I'm 30.
Are you a virgin?
Uh, do you mean technically?
You've come to the right place.
Eaglebauer enterprises is a name that stands for quality.
I'm gonna get you a date with the most primo lady in this school -
Kate Rambeau.
Johnny, why don't you tell Tom how happy he'll be with Kate?
(Johnny over pa)
right you are, Mr. Bauer.
Kate Rambeau, age 17,
attends Vince Lombardi high,
Where she majors
in nuclear physics.
This perky

Include splitting protons
and checkers.
Included
in your night to remember
Is a matched set
of travelways luggage.
(girls' voices) ooh!
That's travelways luggage,
the first name in travel
for over five years.
And now back to you,
Mr. E.
Thank you, Johnny.
There she is, Tom.
I had somebody else in mind.
Oh, Tom, my files indicate she's perfect for you.
I know, I know, but I was kinda hopin'
That you'd set me up with Riff Randell.
Riff Randell?
How about a cheerleader?
Nice set of pompoms.
No! The only girl I ever dream about at night is Riff,
But I always keep waking up just before the good part.
Well, how are you set for large amounts of hard cash?
(snaps fingers) 
I have a major credit card.
Uh, Norma, dear?
Yes, Mr. Eaglebauer.
Yes, would you draw up a contract for Tom Roberts
And Riff Randell?
? you know her life is saved
by rock 'n' roll
? yeah, rock 'n' roll... ?
What's that thing in your ear, Randell?
Um, it's a...
A hearing aid.
Be careful, Miss Steroid.
She's very sensitive about it.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Randell.
What?
Sorry to hear that,
Randell!
Fine. How are you?
Oh, I'm fine, thank you!
Oh, I'd say about a quarter to two.
Come on, Riff, let's go.
But I just had lunch.
So young.
That was close.
We just got out of trouble.
You wanna put us back in?
Are you kidding?
"what's that thing in your ear?"
She doesn't even know the Beatles broke up.
I know something is going on behind my back.
You two are not doing your jobs.
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
You're supposed to be my eyes, my ears, my nose. ahchoo!
Thank you.
If this school is going to get back on the winning track,
We have to start cracking down immediately...
And I know just where to begin.
Ok, you take a note to Mr. Mcgree,
And I want you to take the same note to coach steroid.
Tell them to meet me immediately
In the science lab.
The most famous notes in all of the musical literature.
Now...
"earmail."
Ha-ha-ha.
Class, I have to go to Miss Togar’s office.
I'd like you to look over the chapter on Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony
While I'm gone.
Oh, and, class, as soon as I get back,
There's going to be a surprise quiz on this material. aww!
Come on.
Nice work, Rambeau.
I knew you could do it.
Ok, now come on down.
I'm stuck.
Nonsense.
There's nothing to it.
Just go hand over hand,
But above all, do not slide.
Kate, are you all right?
All right, girls, she's ok.
You're ok, Rambeau.
Get up and walk it off.
Come on.
Come on, girls.
Let's move it.
Hey!
You fat creep.
Yes?
Note.
"darling Evelyn, how I long for the feel your luscious thighs--"
Oh, wrong note.
All right, class...
...Listen up.
Are you ok?
I'm going to be gone for a few minutes.
While I'm away,
I want you to continue
With your exercises for the day.
 aww!
Ah, none of that. let's have a little enthusiasm.
And a...
...A-one and a-two and a-jumping up and down.
Come on, girls.
That's right.
Peppy!
Keep that up till I get back.
Well, you're probably wondering why I called you here.
Me.
I know, I know.
Me.
I know.
I know, I know.
Me.
Go and monitor the halls.
Since assuming office this morning,
I've noticed a number of peculiar incidents
Among the members of the student body,
All having to do with rock-'n'-roll music.
Miss Togar, I have no particular love for rock-'n'-roll,
But it doesn't seem to me that listening to it
Actually hurts the students.
but that's where you're wrong,
Mr. Mcgree.
Recently,
I have been doing a study
Of mice subjected to rock-'n'-roll music.
Here we have a picture of this mouse,
A typical member of the genus rattus rodenti,
As he appeared before the start of my investigation -
Clean, good-natured,
Content to scamper playfully about his cage.
This is a picture of the same mouse...
One week after the introduction of rock-'n'-roll music.
I never dreamed.
Oh, the results were dramatic.
He lost all interest
In keeping his cage tidy.
How scientific.
He played his electric guitar far into the night,
Keeping the other test animals awake.
He did?
And he met this female mouse,
And they have been sharing a cage together
Out of wedlock.
That's fascinating,
Miss Togar.
Yes, it is.
Is she crazy?
She's a principal.
Monitor the hall, monitor the hall.
I am sick of monitoring the hall.
Yep.
Let's go monitor the freshman.
Good idea.
Get him.
All right, up against the wall.
Spread 'em.
All right, what the hell do you think you're doing out here?
I was just getting my books.
Listen, you have a hall pass?
Well, no. no hall pass?
Hit him, hit him.
Guys, I'm allergic to violence.
I break out in blood.
Hit him anyway.
Calm down.
Let me see some id.
I haven't got all day.
I need it for the sock hop tonight.
The sock hop.
Who'd dance with you?
All you have is a buck?
I'll have that.
Is this you?
Well, I take a bad picture.
Tell me about it. ugh.
Listen, I'm gonna give you a demerit.
What's a demerit?
If you get enough of 'em, you wind up in Miss Togar's office.
? demerit, demerit well, what for?
Because...
...You're ugly.
Hit him now.
Hit him. Hit him.
I have a great idea.
Let's go monitor the girls' gym.
All right.
Ok? what are you doing, Riff?
Gym class called on account of boredom.
Got some of my homework instead.
Homework?
Yeah, for Mr. Mcgree's songwriting class.
I've written a song for the Ramones. wait till you hear this. whoo!
? rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
? well, I don't care about history
? rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school

Next I investigated reports of loss of hearing by individuals
Due to the high decibel level involved
In playing rock-'n'-roll music.
Put on these ear protective devices,
As I am going to -
Mr. Mcgree -
Play a song by the Ramones
At the decibel level consistent with that used
In your average concert.
Your standard mouse
And your standard speakers.
Now, back, back.
This is the rock-o-meter.
Gee.
It is used to measure comparative rock-'n'-roll intensity levels.
Watch the mouse while I turn it on.

They're dancing.
Oh, no, Miss Togar, it's calisthenics.
Where are their books?
This is a gym class.
They're exercising their bodies.
What these girls need is to exercise their minds.
I told you - she's crazy.
All right, girls, hit the showers!
All right, girls.
Come on, let's go.
Uh, Cheryl, do you think
Tom Roberts is cute?
Yeah, but he's such a dork.
No, he's not.
I think he's a fox.
A fox?
Tom Roberts is so boring, his brother is an only child.
He's not half as hot as Joey Ramone.
Who's Joey Ramone?
Where have you been -
Mars?
Earth calling Kate.
He just happens to be the lead singer of the Ramones.
I wish we could see them this Thursday at their concert.
So what's stopping you?
We can't cut classes to stand in line for tickets.
That's right.
Oh, please.
Ten years from now, no one will care
If you've ever been to high school, much less skipped a few classes.
You all act as if everything's so important around here.
Just because Togar is stuck in the '50s
Doesn't mean there isn't life after high school.
I've got my own future to think about.
I know I can write for the Ramones.
All I've gotta do is get my songs to them.
They won't be in town for another year,
So I've got to see them now.
Hey, we wanna go as much as you,
But we can't all cut classes.
Well, I guess it's up to me, then,
But you'll have to cover for me, Kate.
I'm gonna take a three-day leave from Camp Lombardi
And be first in line.
If anyone wants to join me at front-row center,
Why, you just let me know.
 ok.
 yeah.

Hello, Mr. Eaglebauer.
How are you doing?
Great, thank you.
Please, sit down, sit down.
What can I do for you, Kate?
Well, I wanna go out on a date.
Say no more.
Eaglebauer enterprises has a man for you.
Tell me, have you had much experience with boys?
Well... Once I played nurse with a boy next door
And got sued for malpractice.
I wish part of Riff would rub off on me.
Everything's so easy for her.
Did you have any one particular person in mind?
Well, I was kind of hoping
That you might fix me up with...
With Tom Roberts.
Tom Roberts?
Yeah.
I love him.
He's a great guy.
I love him.
Well, can you do it?
This will never work.
Tom will never like me.
I don't know who I'm kidding.
What possible reason could there be
To put myself through all this?
Sex.
I must admit, as far as reasons go,
It must be one of the best.
Kate, I've known Tom ever since he was a freshman,
When I sold him his first touchdown.
Believe me, you're just the type of girl he goes for.
(? "did we meet
somewhere before?")
Tom, my man.
How's my would-be Romeo?
Eaglebauer, what are we doing up here?
I thought we were gonna start training today.
This is the perfect spot for it.
Most romantic setting in the city.
Just you, the skyline and your training partner.
Training partner?
Hi, Tom.
I was kind of expecting
Riff Randell.
Eaglebauer, I don't know whether I can go through with this.
Couldn't I just practice with myself?
You done too much of that already.
Yeah.
Now, for the next three days,
You two are gonna have nothing but fun.
Now, the first lesson - necking.
The place - lovers' Lane.
The reason -
Well, you're young.

Not as an accomplice to delinquency.

Uh, just us.
We're the only ones.
Miss Togar, perhaps we're taking this a bit too far.
After all, the concert is on their own time, and it's--
Nonsense! They should be made an example for the whole school.
All right, give me your tickets.
I will give them to Charity.
No way!
Very well.
I'll have my hall monitors take them from you. body search!

Thanks for the tickets,

And everybody's gonna be there.

You can move right in.

Riff!
Huh? Uh...
Oh, uh, the, uh,
The, uh, major export of Ecuador is kapok.
Very good, but that's geography, and this is calculus.
Ooh, sorry.
Look at your math book.
It looks brand new.
I bet you've never even opened it.
I only use it on special equations.
Oh, I don't feel like studying tonight.
Yeah, I've gotta get home, anyway.
I'm expecting Tom to call me tonight.
You really like him, don't you?
Mm-hmm. I've been seeing a lot of him lately.
You have?
Mm-hmm.
Eaglebauer says we were made for one another.
Oh, he did?
I think tonight could be pretty special.
Hello.
She's on the line.
Great. Just remember what I told you.
Yeah. Hello. Hello, Riff?
Hi. It's Tom.
Tom?
Yeah, Tom Roberts.
Football player?
No.
I talk about the weather a lot.
Oh, yeah. Hey, Kate, it's Tom Roberts on the phone.
Tom? Why would he call me here?
So how's it been?
Oh.
Little dry lately.
Yeah, but I hear it's raining cats and dogs in Idaho.
Yes. Yes! Oh, man, it's goin' great.
Great.
Listen, I'm just lying here in my new van,
On my beautiful waterbed,
Listening to the Ramones' brand-new album
On this fantastically expensive stereo
Wondering if you'd like to maybe go out tonight and get drunk?
All right.
Listen, I really wish you'd reconsider-- what?
Sure, I'll go out with you tonight.
You can't do that.
He's mine.
You will?
Just find a date
for Kate, ok?
Great, I will. Listen,
I'll pick you both up in about an hour.
We got it!
Riff, how can you go out with him?
I never thought about Tom until you mentioned him.
What?!
It'd be a change for me, don't you think?
I never went in much for the jock type.
Oh, cut it out.
What about me?
What about tonight?
Don't worry. You'll be in the back seat with Eaglebauer.
He's lots of fun.
I don't wanna have fun.
I wanna be with Tom.
 hey,
I'm only kidding, Kate.
I wouldn't do that to you, huh?
I'll take care of Eaglebauer.
You can have Tom all to yourself.
Hmm?
Shouldn't kid like that,
Riff. shouldn't kid like that.
You know how hot I am for him.
Hot?
Yes, hot.
Whoa.
"hot," off the lips of Kate.
My goodness. Ha-ha.
Ha-ha, we did it!
We did it.
I got you a date with Kate. Whoo-hoo.
Hot equals Joey Ramone.
No, hot equals Tom.
Ehh.
Aw, I can't believe it.
I can't believe it was that easy.
He looks like a little cherub or something. Looks like he's gonna fly away to Heaven.
He's so sweet-looking, kinda like a cream puff.
That's why I like him.
I like Joey Ramone 'cause he's tall and handsome.
He looks like a poem to me.
A poem?
We get them drunk, we go in the back, we hit the waterbed...
We gotta take turns in the back.
All he eats is pizza.
I just love the way he holds the pizza dripping above his mouth.
He slithers and slides it into his mouth.
It's so sexy the way it...
Gross.
 ? questioningly
? her eyes looked at me...
This is
screamin' Steve again,
And I've got two free tickets
to tonight's Ramones concert
For the person
who can call and tell me
What album
this song is on...
"questioningly."
"questioningingly."
What album?
Oh, what album?
Oh, what is it?
Is it road to ruin?
Yes, that's it!
Oh, Kate, how'd you know?
It says it right here on the cassette.
Quick, where's a phone?
Where's a phone?
We've gotta get to a phone!
Right over there.
Aah!
...Very special. What I'm trying to say is, dear,
I'd like to ask--
This is very difficult.
Please don't hang up.
I'd like to ask you to-to-to be my wife.
Sorry, but you're not my type.
Oh, please, God, don't let it be busy. it's ringing.
Hello? Yes, the answer is "road to ruin."
Aah! We won! We won!
What? Yes, it's Riff Randell and Kate Rambeau.
Of course we'll be there.
Yes, thank you. Oh, thank you.
Oh, we're going.
Oh, Kate, we're going, we're going. Oh, we're going.
Aah!
What about Tom?
Oh, come on. How often do you get to see the Ramones?
Oh, but tonight we were gonna be meant for each other.
This is my big Chance to get my songs to them.
We have to go.
You'll have a great time.
and the super-lucky winners
of the two free tickets
For tonight's
Ramones concert
Are Riff Randell
and Kate Rambeau.
Hello?
Hello? Tom?
Kate and I can't make it tonight. We've been in a horrible seven-car accident.
We've gotta go to the hospital for immediate blood transfusions.
We'll see you tomorrow in school. Bye.
Aah!
I think he took it well.
Let's go get dressed.
But I am dressed.
Yeah, but not for the Ramones.
I got clothes that'll make you fit right in.
Come on, sexy.
The only thing I'll ever lay is a carpet.
You can't take this lying down.
You gotta crash that concert, grab her up into your arms.
Love conquers all.
Besides, I'd have to give ya a refund.
Oh, I think I'm gonna puke.
Oh, sorry, Mantovani's down the block.
I'm hep, daddy-o.
I'm into the Ramones.
Sure you are.
Got any drugs?
Bottles? Cans? Cameras?
Let me check ya out here. anybody got any glue?
who's the geek in the beret? how old's that guy?
Look at the way he's dressed.
Oh, I'm sorry, we don't let any more mice in here.
They've been exploding all over the place.
Oh, you got headphones?
Great, great.
Just don't get too close to the pa.
Wait, here's your stub.
Ok, go on in.
Enjoy the show. get this guy.
Is he chic, or what?
Really, have you ever seen anyone... who's got the carbonas? that's my songs.
Bottles, cans, cameras on ya?
No, nothing. Nothing.

Excuse me. nice ass.
Pinched me.

You're stoned. This guy doesn't get in.

? and so it goes,
and so it goes,

? and so it goes...
Kate, do you realize they're all really brothers?
Imagine being the only sister in the Ramones' family. we want the Ramones!
I'm so lovin' it! come out, please, Joey! we want the Ramones.
Hi, gang!
This is screamin' Steve Stevens
Steamin' your way over station 666
With
the screamin' Steve show. oh, wow!
We're comin' at ya, alive and kickin',
With the hottest band this side of the iron curtain -
The Ramones! you know it, Steve. we love you, Ramones!
Dig it.
But first, I'd like to introduce the two winners
Of the Charity ticket raffle
Donated by the principal of Vince Lombardi high!
Togar eats it!
Sister Maria Teresa and sister Teresa Maria.
Now, that's a step in the right direction.
And to keep this administration moving forward,
I've made a list of new school policy,
Which I would like instituted immediately.
Take this down.
Girls - skirts below their knees
And boys' hair above their collar.
And I think it would be tidy if they wore neckties.
And lunch is to be cut down
To half an hour
Because I am doubling up on silent study hall.
Well, I think that should teach them a lesson in deportment.
How do you spell that?
D-e-portment.
Now I want you to meet the two winners
Of the screamin' Steve ticket contest -
Riff Randell and Kate Rambeau! yay, Riff!
You're live on the air, girls.
Why don't you say a few words to the folks at home? Go.
On behalf of the students from Vince Lombardi high who are here tonight,
I'd just like to say one thing -
Screw you, principal Togar.
We made it to the concert, anyway! Yeah!
Who says today's youth has nothin' to say, huh?
(inaudible yelling) 
Those girls have turned the whole school against me.
Hansel, Gretel.
I want you to crash that concert.
I want Randell and Rambeau brought back here immediately.
So you're Kate Rambeau, huh?
Yeah.
I just loved your latest
scientific American.
Thanks.
Hey, would you two lovely ladies
Like to see screamin' Steve in action
As he interviews the Ramones?
Oh, great. I know just the questions to ask.
That's beautiful, 'cause
I can't think of a thing.
I've waited so long to see them. I know they're gonna love my songs.
I can believe it.
Ya ready? Here we go.
Hey, you wanna keep it down out here?
They're tuning up.
How'd you get in there?
Professional secret.
What's this stuff?
Stuff is gonna prove to the Ramones that I can write songs for them,
So out of my way, dew drop.
I'm sorry, but the Ramones' manager,
A personal friend of mine,
Put me in charge of keeping everyone out.
What's all the trouble,
Angel, baby, huh?
Screamin'.
Well...
Good to see ya.
Long time, right?
Uh, who are these two?
These are screamin' Steve's contest winners.
Oh, uh, sorry, girls, you'll have to wait outside.
Oh, man...
Can't we just watch?
Angel dearest, why don't you see these sweet young things to their seats?
We'll go ourselves, thanks.
It's gonna be ok. Yeah.
Screamin', I was wondering if you could give us a little more airtime.
I'm hittin' it once an hour.
You can do a little better.
Hey-ho, let's go!
Hey-ho, let's go!
Hey-ho, let's go!

That, Mrs. Rambeau, is where your daughter is.
My daughter Kate?
I thought she was
in the basement
splitting protons.
Oh, just as I thought,
Which is why I called a special assembly together tomorrow
To deal with this crisis.
I'm going to need every parent's help, so...
Listen carefully.
? well, I'm going out west where I belong
? where the days are short and the nights are long
? and I'll walk, and they'll walk
? and I'll twist, and they'll twist

Joey, Joey, Joey!
Tom? Tom. Tom, are you all right?
Speak to me.
Riff, my head.
Riff?
I've just been handed this note.
It says, "dear Ramones,
"all my friends from Vince Lombardi high are here tonight.
"even though our principal
Miss Togar thinks you make nothin' but noise,
I think you're the greatest."
Do you mean you signed up with Eaglebauer to be with me?
Yes.
Listen, I'm glad you're not Riff.
What do you say we become friends, anyway?
"please dedicate your next song to my friends Tom and Kate.
Love, your number one fan,
Riff Randell."
Ok, this is for Tom and Kate, from our number one fan.
Yay!
? yeah, yeah, she's the one
? yeah, yeah, she's the one
? when I see her on the street
? you know she makes my life complete
? and you know I told you so aren't they great?
? she's the one, she's the one
? yeah, yeah, she's my girl
That's me.
? yeah, yeah, she's my girl
? and when I see her on the street
? you know she makes my life complete
? and you know I told you so, she's the one, she's the one
? she's the one

I'll always love you

? but in my heart,
I'll always be true
? yeah, yeah, she's my girl
? the best girl in the whole wide world
Back, back.

? you know she makes my life complete
? and you know I told you so, she's the one, she's the one
? the one
? she's the one, she's the one
? she's the one
? she's the one, she's the one
? she's the one
? she's the one, she's the one
? she's the one ?
Joey.
Yay, Joey!
I told you you'd have a great time.
I am.
Maybe that's them in there.
Oh, boy, we got 'em now.
Have you seen two young high school girls around?
Yeah, I got 'em on me. body search!
Aah!
Is he all right?
Hey, pizza!
Great.
What are you doing here?
These are my songs.
I've been trying to get them to you for the longest time.
Hey, it's Riff Randell, our number one fan.
Oh, wow, you remembered my name.
This is the big time, girlie.
This is rock-'n'-roll.
Yeah, well, this is
"rock 'n' roll high school."
"rock 'n' roll high school"?
Yeah, I wrote it for
Mr. Mcgree's music class,
But I really wrote it for you, Joey.
Hey, pizza! It's great.
Let's dig in.
Yeah, I want some.
Oh, thanks.
How many times do I have to tell you?
No pizza for you, Joey.
More wheat germ and riboflavin.
Yeah, come on, Joey.
Eat. Good.
I'm gonna eat some myself.
Mmm. Mmm.
Organic alfalfa sprouts.
Come on, Joey.
Good. Mmm. Come on, eat, Joey.
Good boy. Yeah.
Mama'll love ya. You like it, huh? Huh? Good, yeah.
Iron, niacin, b12.
Grown from the earth.
Good...
I'll cherish this moment forever.
This is how I like to see you, my son.
Ok. Ok, girlie, the boys'll take a look at 'em
And get back to you tomorrow, huh?
Yeah, we're gonna be in town one more day,
And if we like 'em, we'll come pay you and Mr. Mcglibb a visit.
Say hi to Vince for us.
Oh, wow.
This is the happiest day of my life.
Gabba gabba, hey.
And I say to you parents,
This high school is a failure.
The past semester has been a black Mark
On the proud tradition of Vince Lombardi high.
Student Riff Randell alone has disrupted classes...
They can't say I haven't contributed anything.
...And banded the students against me
To attend a concert of the Ramones.
Hey, yeah!
That's right.
...That awful rock and roll music.
You see before you my first major step
In putting this school back on the winning track.
I give you...
The final solution.
Those are our records.
Hey, gimme those.
And this is what we think of the Ramones... we've gotta stop her!
Somebody stop her!
She can't do that! hey!
Miss Togar,
I cannot stand by and allow you to do this.
Then stand aside,
Mr. Mcgree.
Let me through.
(Eaglebauer) she's burning our records!
We gotta stop her!
I'll get the hose.
Togar!
That's the last straw, Randell.
Detention... For life!
(? "school's out"
by Alice Cooper)
? school's out for Summer let's take the school.
My darling Evelyn, how I long for the feel of your luscious thighs.
See you later, Togar.
It's already fifth period. she's gonna call the cops.
? no more pencils
? no more books... ?
Hey, come on, you guys.
Follow me into the school.
I regret that I have only one life to give for rock-'n'-roll.
You belong in school with us,
Mr. Mcgree. Come on.
Things sure have changed since we got kicked out of high school.
Oh. Where are you going?
To Mr. Mcgree's class.
Well, I'm happy to see some students still are interested
In their studies.
We're not students.
We're the Ramones.
Ramones? You're responsible for making that horrible rock-'n'-roll music?
You turned the whole school against me.
Do your parents know that you're Ramones?
Come on in. yay, Ramones! kill the principal!
Rock-'n'-roll high school is on the air again.
(? "high school" by mc5) 
? well, come on
? kids want a little action
? kids want a little fun
More exciting than study hall.
? ...Have to get their kicks
? before the evening's done
? 'cause they're
goin' to high school...
Hoy, hoy, hoy, hey, hey hey.
I'm really groovin', baby.
? high school,
hey, hey, hey
? you better
get out of the way
They're going to destroy the school.
I can't believe it.
Whoo!
Ooh...
? they only wanna
shake it up, baby
? dance to the rockin' bands
? they only want
a little excitement
? they like to get
a little out of hand... oh, students...
Oh, students.
What the hell...? we've got ya now.
Get down, Mcgree.
Whoo! Whoo-hoo! surf's up.
Call the national guard.
They're causing a riot.
These kids are--
The national guard?
But my children are inside that school.
Oh, dear.
? the kids know what
the deal is
? they're gettin'
farther out every day
? we're gonna be taking over...
Get off, you little...
God, you weigh...

Wait, wait.
You're gonna get it now, fat boys!
Whoo!
Nice garters.
Whoo, sexy legs.
Whoo, Mcgree.
Firing line...
Apple brown betty.
We were only following the recipes!
Firing line...
The Tuesday surprise!
No, no, not the Tuesday surprise. taste treat. it's delish.
Go get 'em, guys!
? well, come on, let's go,
let's go, little darlin'... eat it, Vince!
? come on, come on,
let's go, and again
? and again and again
and again
? well... ?
No, no.
Oh, what the hell...?
Oh, my God...
(students) yeah!
Demerit! Demerit!
Demerit! Demerit! come on up, and we'll bang your erasers.
So what do you think of my school, guys?
Boy, when you have recess, you really go all out.
Consider yourselves officially enrolled in rock-'n'-roll high school.
The facilities are yours.
Do whatever you want.
? do you wanna dance and hold my hand?
? tell me, baby,
I'm your lover man
? baby, do you wanna dance?
? do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
? squeeze me, baby, all through the night
? oh, baby, do you wanna dance?
? do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
? do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
? do you, do you, do you?
? do you wanna dance?
? do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
? squeeze me, baby, all through the night
? oh, baby, do you wanna dance?
? do you wanna dance under the moonlight?
? squeeze me, baby, all through the night
? oh, baby, do you wanna dance?
? do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
? do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
? do you, do you, do you?
? do you wanna dance?
Go on, get out there!
Yeah!
? do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
? do you, do you, do you?
? do you wanna dance?
? do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
? do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?

? do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
? do you, do you, do you?
? do you wanna dance? ?
(cheering) 
Attention!
Give it to me.
Attention, students. attention, students.
Hey, quiet!
Quiet, everybody! Listen!
This is your principal -
Miss Evelyn Togar!
I wanna speak to Riff Randell.
Quiet! Come on.
Into my office.
I don't think it's working.
I know how to...
You don't think it's working?
Start talking, Togar.
It's your dime.
Ok, Randell. I know we've had our differences in the past,
But I think it's time we tried to understand one another.
I think the problem is clear.
I am a reasonable, well-educated, mature adult member of society,
And you are a spoiled heathen punk who has taken over my school.
So let's make a deal.
I can have you expelled and turned over to the police.
But I'm gonna forget about that
And just put one black Mark on your permanent record
That will follow you throughout the rest of your life...
...If you'll just come out of there right now.
I don't think one more black Mark is gonna make too much of a difference.
Eaglebauer, your partner, comes through again.
All right.
Here's what I think about your school records, Togar!
You handled that very well,
Miss Togar.
What's that?
I don't know. I...
Miss Togar!
Well, now they've done it.
Destroying government property.
I think ya failed,
Miss Togar. I think we're gonna have to do it my way.
I think you're right.
Randell, I just talked to the chief of police.
You're not out in five minutes, he's going to Storm the building.
Well, you heard it, folks.
Miss Togar has just given the students of rock-'n'-roll high
An ultimatum.
A classic confrontation between mindless authority
And the rebellious nature of youth.
The moment of truth is at hand. What will these kids do next?
Boy, this sure is rock-'n'-roll high school.
Yeah, we liked it so much, we're gonna play it on our next album.
To show our appreciation, we're gonna make you an honorary Ramone.
Hey, guys, people say that your music is loud
And destructive and lethal to mice,
But I think you're the Beethovens of our time.
That was a good one,
Mr. Mcgree.
Kate, is it a go?
It's a go.
All right!
Everybody follow me.
We're gonna evacuate.
I guess we should rush the building.
Not so fast. Look.
They're coming out.
It's over.
We won.
Ladies and gentlemen, school is out.
It appears as if the final bell has rung for these students.
Has Riff Randell given up?
Has she and her fellow classmates
Failed Miss Togar’s final exam?
Is this the end of rock-'n'-roll high?
Just what do you have to say for yourself, young lady?
I have seen the errors of my ways.
I'd just like to say to all students everywhere
That you may think the school is yours for a while,
But it's always run by the principal and her administration.
That's nice.
Vince Lombardi high is...
Is your school, Miss Togar,
So you can have it.
Well, I'm very happy to see that you've come to your senses.
And what would you have done with the school, anyway?
Rock the roof off it.
Hit it, Marky!
? rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
? well, I don't care about history
? rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
? 'cause that's not where
I wanna be...
It's so loud.
? I just wanna have some kicks
? I just wanna get some chicks
? rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school
? well, the girls out there knock me out, you know
? rock, rock, rock 'n' roll high school

Ah, you guys, you look very nice and I just came to say hello.

Interesting. - It is interesting.
- It's the best one you've done if I may say so.
- It's cos I'm watching you, you see. I'm learning from you.
Do you like the lines around the lips?
No, I don't like and she knows that.
But I like the idea of the blue lines with the pink lipstick. That's quite good.
- You see how they pick on me and make me feel terrible?
- You're a girl. What do you know about make-up?
Exactly! That's what I say all the time(!)
Make-up for a night out on the town, with the boys.

INTRO: "Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"
# Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
# Pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
# The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers but still you forget
# Ohhh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
# You're too young to lose it
# But you're too old to lose it
# And the clock waits so patiently on your song
# Well you walk past the cafe but you can't eat when you've lived too long
# Oh no no no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide
# Now the Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
# But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
# Don't let the sunlight blast your shadow
# Don't let the milk float ride your mind
# You're so natural - religiously unkind
# Oh no, love, you're not alone
# You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
# You got your head all tangled up but if I can only make you care
# Oh no, love, you're not alone
# No matter what or who you've been
# No matter when or where you've seen
# All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
# I've had my share, now I'll help you with the pain

Life is a wink of time
Heaven's a lonely climb
The road is so dark and long
Paved with all kinds of wrong
And freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Man's got to make his own
Sun warms the earth below
Earth drinks the winter snow
Seas feed the winds that blow
Rain makes the grain to grow
And freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Man's got to make his own
We're all born to live
With love to give
Free in the heart and mind
We're all born to be
With a soul that's free
Man made the chains that bind
Freedom
Talkin' 'bout freedom
Freedom
Man's got to make his own
God made the sun to rise
And God made the earth and skies
God made the seas and plains
God made the winds and rains
And freedom

Huck, oh, ho, Huckleberry
Huck, say, hey
Say, Huckleberry, Huck
Oh, oh, Huckleberry
Say, Huckleberry Finn
Say, Huckleberry, Huckleberry Finn
To the possum, you're the next of kin
Hey, Huckleberry, Huckleberry Finn
Boss is gonna getcha, gonna fetcha home
Hey, Huck
Gonna bet you're somewheres off alone
You all seen Huckleberry?
No, Jim.
Hey, Huckleberry, Huckleberry Finn
Huckleberry, where you been?
Huckleberry, where you been?
Huckleberry, where you been?
Marybelle, have you seen Huckleberry?
No, not around here, I haven't.
All right. Thank you.
Sun's a-settin' in the same old place
Moon's about to climb the sky
You're a-wastin' all my time a-chasin'
'Cause your supper is about to fry
Mr. Tomkins... has Huck Finn been in here today?
No, he hasn't, Jim.
Well, I best go on down to the river, then.
Ho, ho, Huckleberry
Huck, ho, ho, Huckleberry
Huck, say, hey
Hey, Huckleberry, Huck, ho, ho
Huckleberry, hey, Huckleberry, hey
Folks are cozyin' to home 'bout now
But you're out mozyin'
So I've been chozyin'
To fetch you back to home with me
Huckleberry, where you been?
Huckleberry, where you been?
Huckleberry, where you been?
Jim!
Oh, I knew it wasn't no catfish.
Tug was more like a whale.
You got to get home quick.
The ladies are waiting supper on you, and I know you don't want no more punishment, now do you, Huckleberry?
- Heck, no.
- All right, then. Let's go.
And Mr. Dobbins said all you have to do is learn to apply yourself better.
He said you had good natural intelligence and you learn very fast.
He could be the head of the class if he'd only try.
I'd like to see him the head of the Sunday school class.
In fact, I'd just like to see him
in his Sunday school class.
Just what was your lesson for next Sunday?
Mmm... Moses a-a-and the bull rushers.
Huckleberry, dear, my sister and I are only concerned about your future.
Judge Thatcher put that buried treasure money that you found into a trust.
When you come of age, you're going to be a young gentlemen of considerable means.
You don't have to end up like your father... a derelict with his body floating down the river.
Sometimes I get the feelin' that Pap ain't dead.
And that body they found floatin' was floatin' face up.
And everybody knows that a dead man floats face down.
Leastwise, that's the feelin' I get.
Better get upstairs and do your studying now, Huckleberry.
Yes, ma'am.
And it wouldn't hurt to take another look at that chapter on Moses and the bull rushers.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm getting more concerned about that boy every day.
Oh, sister.
You worry too much.
You think you're a good deal of a big bug, don't ya?
Pap! You ain't dead!
You've put on considerable many frills since I've been away.
You can read and write.
Who told you you might meddle with such high-falutin' foolishness, huh?
- The widder.
- The widder, eh?!
Who told the widder she could put in her shovel of a thing that ain't none of her business?
Nobody, Pap.
I'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father.
Let on to be better than what he is!
They say you're rich, eh?
How's that?
Well, I found some money, Pap.
They put it in a trust till...
Liar!
Mr. Finn!
What are you doing?!
What do you want?
What I'm doin' is learnin' my son not to lie.
And what I want is what's rightfully mine.
The money he's lyin' about.
Come on!
Huckleberry has no money!
None he can put his hands on...
All I know is I want $1,000!
Now, if you ever wanna see this kid again, you have it for me in two days.
- Come on!
- We're poor women.
Where would we get that much money?
You're a poor woman, ain't ya?
With a big, healthy slave down there who'll fetch a fine piece of money from the slave traders.
Come on!
Please, Mr. Finn!
Mr. Finn, please let me talk to you.
Mr. Finn, please!
Please!
Don't take him away from me!
Mr. Finn!
Two days!
You have the money here.
I'll be back.
- Honey.
- Jim.
I gotta go. I gotta go now.
I gotta get away from here.
Got to go?
What did you do, Jim?
I ain't done nothin', but they're gonna sell me to the slave traders.
- Not Miss Watson.
- She can't help it.
Huck's pap done came and took him away.
And the ladies... they need the money to buy Huck back.
Jim, you know what they do to runaway slaves.
They catch you, they whip you, they truss you up like a hog!
But if they sell me... then I may as well be dead.
'Cause I won't never see you no more.
But where will you go?
Where will you hide?
I'll try to make it to the free states.
To... well, to Cairo, Illinois.
That's... that's the closest place.
Cairo? Why, that must be a thousand miles from here.
Someday there ain't gonna be no more good-byes.
Someday, honey, darlin'
Won't be tears in your eyes
And someday we'll be standing
With our heads held up high
Smilin' and a-laughin'
Just for no reason why
I see it plain that somehow
I don't know now
But I know we'll be fine
Trust me, oh, honey, trust me
'Cause I've seen me a sign
That someday, honey, darlin'
Don't know how long it'd be
Honey, darlin'
Honey, darlin'
You must remember this
Though I'm goin' far away
It's gonna be all sunshine
And singin'
Someday
I can't explain, but somehow
I don't know now
But I know we'll be fine
You, me, and the baby
Oh, I've seen me that sign
That someday, honey, darlin'
Don't know how long it'd be
Honey, darlin'
Honey, darlin'
You belong just to me
Pap! Pap! Wake up!
Pap, you was havin' another one of your fits.
It ain't fair.
You sleep sound while I've got the demons chasing me.
Likes I won't get no sleep till I'm dead.
Get yourself down to the lines, see if we got any breakfast.
What's takin' you so long?!
Hurry up!
- We get any fish?
- Yeah, Pa!
I fell in, Pap.
It ain't so bad, us bein' together again.
Is it, Pap?
Just don't get too comfortable about it.
As soon as I get that money,
I don't care if you go straight to hell.
You've been bad luck for me since the day you was born!
You killed your mother gettin' born... you know that!
I'm goin' across to Hannibal now.
And your two sweet old ladies better have my $1,000.
My son comes into money
I'll tell ya what I see
Two gospel-spoutin' biddies is stealin' it from me
I never got a tumble,
I never got a break
But now my luck's a-changin'
I'll get all I can take
Rotten luck
Filthy rotten luck
The only kind of luck
I ever had
Rotten luck
Stinkin' rotten luck
But now, at last, my luck
Ha! It ain't so bad!
They're all liars!
Runaway slave.
Like hell he run away.
Murder!
Murder!
He's been murdered!
Huck, can you... can you hear me?
Here, sit up.
Take it easy now.
There you are.
You rest easy, right there.
Take it easy.
Here. Drink this.
Oh, I gave you up for dead almost two days ago.
- What happened, Jim?
- Snake bite.
The only thing to do is to cut an X, suck out the poison and pray.
What's this?
That's... that's a hex.
I ain't stuperstitious or nothin', but, uh...
Well, with a friend's life, you don't wanna take too many chances.
Gosh, Jim.
Thanks for savin' my life.
Don't thank me.
You best thank that hex.
They been comin' past this island every day shootin' off them cannons tryin' to raise your body.
I heard 'em talkin' from the boats.
You supposed to be murdered.
Well, I just had to get away from Pap.
So I broke out and I killed me this wild pig.
Then I bloodied up the place real smart.
Well, they tell me it's real bad luck makin' out like you're dead.
How'd you come to get here, Jim?
- I ran away, Huck.
- You ran away?
And now you know, and now they your troubles, too.
So, I figure, I die showin' nothin' they sell me down to New Orleans to them slave traders.
So I come here, and I'm just about finished buildin' me this raft with a wigwam on it and a nice, dry sand on the floor.
Well, anywheres you land they's gonna pick you up for runaway.
Don't you know that?
Not if I make it to the free states, they ain't.
Free states?!
That's pretty far.
Cairo, Illinois.
We gonna cha-dugga-dugga on down the river to the free states!

Jim! Look!
Hey, looks like a wrecked houseboat.
Looks like she hasn't been a-ground too long.
You know, Huck, we just may be in luck.
You tie her off here and I'll see what we can find.
Oh, we gonna feast fancy tonight!
Pap.
You find anything?
Nothin'. There ain't nothin' in there but... a dead man.
It ain't nothin' but a house of death.
Let's get outta here.
Goshen should be over there.
Huck, we're lost.
Well, let's head for that cove over there.
I'll find out where we are.
- Who is it?
- Just me, ma'am.
Well, who's "just me"?
Sarah Williams, ma'am.
Well, whereabouts you live?
In this neighborhood?
In Bookerville.
I've walked all the way, and I'm all tired out.
Hungry, too, I reckon.
I'll fetch you somethin' to eat.
Come in and take a chair.
Thank you, ma'am.
But I ain't hungry.
You see, my mother's down sick and out of money and everything.
And, well,
I come to visit my uncle.
And, well, I never been here in Goshen before.
Goshen? This ain't Goshen, child.
This is St. Petersburg.
St. Petersburg?
Goshen's 30 miles up the river.
- Who told you this was Goshen?
- Why, a man I met this morning.
Well, he was drunk,
I reckon.
And you, poor thing, walkin' around with a murderin' runaway slave hidin' out in these parts.
A murderin' slave?
Killed a lad named Huck Finn.
Near Hannibal.
It's an $800 reward on his head.
What did you say your name was, honey?
Mary Williams.
I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in.
Yes, ma'am, I did.
It's Sarah Mary Williams.
Oh, that's the way it is, is it?
Yes, ma'am.
Maybe you'll find a bigger needle in there.
What's your real name?
Is it Tom? Dick? Bob?
What is it?
Please don't poke fun at a poor girl like me. If I'm in your way...
Just sit right down there.
You're a runaway 'prentice, ain't you?
Well, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am.
I won't tell on you.
Don't worry.
Now tell me all about it.
My mother and father's dead.
And the law... well, they bound me out to this mean old farmer in the country, and so I stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out.
When a cow's laying down, which side of it gets up first?
Hind end, ma'am.
- Well, then a horse?
- Forward end, ma'am.
If 15 cows is browsin' on a hillside, how many eat facin' in the same direction?
Well, the whole 15, ma'am.
Well, I reckon you have lived in the country.
I thought you was tryin' to hocus me again.
No, ma'am.
Tell me, what's your real name?
George Peters, ma'am.
- Well, try to remember it, George.
- Yes, ma'am.
You do a girl tolerable poor.
Trot along to your uncle,
Sarah-Mary-Williams-George-Peters.
You'll fetch Goshen by goin' through town and followin' the river up.
Yes, ma'am. Thank ya.
Mind you, boy.
Go through town.
Whatever you do, don't cut through that plantation.
No, ma'am.
Good night, ma'am.
Be done, boys! Hush!
- Who be ya?
- George Jackson, sir.
Stand up, boy.
Whatcha doin' prowlin' round here this time of the night for?
I'm lost. Fell overboard off the steamboat.
Jace. Now, look here. You're tellin' the truth, you needn't be afraid.
- Nobody's gonna hurt you.
- Clothes are dry, Pa.
How come your clothes are dry, George Jackson?
Well, I fell off this afternoon.
George Jackson... are you kin to the Shepherdsons?
No, sir.
You know the Shepherdsons?
No, sir.
I never heard of 'em.
Mr. Jackson,
I'm Colonel Saul Grangerford.
And these are my sons.
It would be my distinct pleasure to have you as our guest here at Grangerford.
Gimme your arm, boy!
Come in.
Mr. Jackson, sir, my name is Buck.
And whiles you're here at Grangerford Manor,
I will be your personal manservant and valet.
Well, would you mind fetchin' me out of this here contraption?
See, I usually does my body-washin' in the river.
Here at Grangerford Manor, there are only gentlefolks.
And they do all their body-washing inside the house.
What's this?
This is your nightcap, sir.
All gentlefolks wear this.
- 'Night, Mr. Jackson.
- Good night.
Jim!
- Good morning, family.
- Good morning, Papa.
- Sleep well, Mr. Jackson?
- Oh, yes. Thank you, sir.
But... if it's all right with you,
I'd like to leave after breakfast.
Don't worry, boy.
We won't let you outstay your welcome.
Mr. Jackson, you look like a bright young man.
Thank you, sir.
Tell me, Mr. Jackson, where was Moses when the candle went out?
Well, I don't know.
I never heard of it before.
Was he in the bull rushers?
Well, guess.
How can I guess if I never heard of it before?
Well, you can guess, can't ya?
It's just as easy.
- Which candle?
- Any candle.
I don't know where he was.
Where was he?
Why, he was in the dark... that's where he was!
- Miss Charlotte.
- Thank you, Mitzi.
I have just composed my finest poem.
It's all about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Botts that fell down a well and was drownded.
Drownded?
Would you like me to read my poem?
I'd be mighty obliged,
Miss Emmeline.
"Ode to Stephen Dowling Botts, deceased."
"And did young Stephen sicken?
"And did young Stephen die?
"And did the sad hearts thicken?
"And did the mourners cry?
"No, such was not the fate of young Stephen Dowling Botts.
"His soul did from this cold world fly by fallin' down a well."
Mighty inspirational, Miss Emmeline.
Mighty inspirational.
I'm so worried about Charlotte.
So worried.
Don't fuss, Rachel, honey.
Don't fuss.
Clive, I must apologize for Charlotte.
I came all the way from New Hope.
I know.
And I'm most sorry.
Just a few friends and relations, Mr. Jackson.
- Handsome tradition, don't you think?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Drink up, Mr. Jackson.
Good Grangerford punch.
Saul, you don't seem to understand.
I haven't seen hide nor hair of our Charlotte since early afternoon.
And she knows Cousin Clive has come all the way from New Hope to see her.
I sent Jason into town to find her.
Don't fret, Rachel, honey.
She'll be along.
My daughters prepared a little entertainment for you.
So, you all gather around.
I found a rose in a Bible
Who knows the story it told
Pressed there with joy or with a tear
It was just a forgotten souvenir
Is our love a rose in a Bible?
A bud that will lose its perfume
Please tell me no
Say that our love will grow
Like a flower
Forever in bloom
Now, would all you gentlemen and ladies join us?
I found a rose in a Bible
Who knows the story it told
Pressed there with joy
- Mr. Jackson, sir.
- Thank you.
Aren't you going to ask me for a dance, Mr. Jackson?
Ma'am, I don't rightly know.
Is our love a rose in a Bible?
A bud that will lose its perfume
Please tell me no
Say that our love will grow
Like a flower
Forever in...
Pa! She's run off!
Charlotte! She's run off!
My own sister!
She's run off and eloped with Harvey Shepherdson.
Horses!
Weapons!
We're gonna kill us some Shepherdsons tonight.
Ain't no need for horses, Pa.
The Shepherdsons have surrounded the place now.
Bring out the guns.
All women and children into the wine cellar.
Buck! He's my gun bearer and my loader.
Mr. Jackson,
I think you're man enough to watch me kill some of those Shepherdsons.
I think you're gonna enjoy it!
Thank you, Buck.
Stay with me.
Snuff out the lights.
Polluters!
Defilers of our Shepherdson blood.
Tonight we spill Grangerford blood!
It's a matter of honor!
Bull's eye.
Feud is a funny thing,
Mr. Jackson.
Man has a quarrel with another man, and he kills him.
And that other man's brother... he kills him.
And the other brothers on both sides...
...they go for one another.
Then the cousins chip in.
If you'd be so kind as to rip down that drape and stomp out the fire,
I'd be ever so grateful to ya,
Mr. Jackson.
Buck!
Gimme my pistol.
Williams!
Bring me some punch.
Take your coat off, Mr. Jackson.
You're in action now!
Thank you, Buck.
How long's this feud been going on, Colonel?
Oh, 60 years or somewhere about that.
What was the trouble about?
I don't rightly know.
It was about some land or something.
Who done the shooting?
Was it Grangerford or was it Shepherdson?
That, Mr. Jackson, is entirely beside the point.
It has now become a matter of honor.
Come with me, Mr. Jackson.
Come with me.
Come on, Mr. Jackson.
Now's your chance.
River's down there.
If I was you, Mr. Jackson,
I'd get myself far away from these here gentlefolks.
Thank you, Buck.
I'm much obliged to ya.
Mr. Jackson, sir!
Mr. Jackson, sir!
Oh, Mr. Jackson.
I was only playin' possum!
- Good-bye, Buck.
- Good-bye.
Is that you?
Hey, I've never been happier to see somebody in my whole life!
Thank God you're all right. I heard them shots last night, I thought they killed you.
- What did they do to you?
- Let's not lose any time.
Let's just shove off for the big water as fast as we can.
All right.
That must've been Goshen back there.
We come 30 miles, Jim.
Yep.
You know... there ain't no home like a raft.
Other places seem so cramped up and smothery.
But a raft doesn't.
You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.
There's only one thing botherin' me.
And that's folks thinkin' that I murdered you.
My bein' called a runaway... that don't bother me at all.
But I don't wanna be called no murderer.
Well, you know I can't show my face back to Hannibal and tell folks
I haven't been murdered.
They'd send me back to Pap for sure.
The way I see it, we just gotta stick together now.
I'm your only evidence.
- Turn in this here cove!
- Yes, sir!
I can't wait till we get to Cairo.
I'm gonna catch me one of them big boats... and gonna ship out as a cabin boy to South America.
And then I'm gonna start my own coffee plantation.
There's lots of money in coffee beans.
But me...
I'm gonna stay in dry goods.
- What's the matter, Jim?
- Slave hunters!
- Who's that yonder?
- It's just a raft, sir.
- Any men on it?
- Just one and me.
Hush up, Jim.
Well, there's five niggers run off tonight up yonder above the head of the bend.
Your man white or black?
He's white, sir.
I reckon we'll see for ourselves.
Catch this here line.
Pap and me is much obliged to ya.
I can tell ya, everybody scoots off when I want 'em to tow this blamed raft ashore.
Well, that's infernal mean.
Odd, too.
Say, boy, what's the matter with your father?
Well... it ain't anything much.
Boy, you're hidin' somethin'.
What is the matter with your pap?
Well...
Please, if you'll just tow us to shore.
You won't have to get near the raft.
Your pap's got the smallpox!
And you know it precious well!
Drop that line, boy!
Confound it!
I just bet the wind's done blowed it to us!
Why didn't you come out and say so?!
You wanna spread it all over?!
Well, everybody else I told run off and left us.
Poor devil.
We're downright sorry for ya.
But, well, hang it! We don't wanna get the smallpox, don't ya see?
Let's get outta here.
Goodbye, boy!
Good luck.
You see any runaway niggers, you get help and nab 'em!
You can make some good money by it.
Thank you, sir! I won't let any runaway get by me if I can help it.
I ain't no damn abolutionist.
Huck... Huck, here I am.
- Are they outta sight yet?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna roast in hell forever for all the lies I told for you.
You didn't have to get in the water.
Well, I didn't wanna take no chances.
You sure had them scared.
Well...
We best spend the night on the shore.
Come on.
Get them off this boat. We'll have none of that kind of thing around here.
Get them off the boat right now.
- Take your hands off me!
- Get off my ship. Stay off.
We'll have none of that... none of that riff-raff.
Take the scalawags off.
- You'll hear from my law...
- Card sharks! River hustlers!
First you fleece my passengers, but that ain't enough.
Then you start takin' my whole crew!
Do you know, sir, to whom you are speaking?!
Tell him, Bilgewater!
I'll have you know, sir, that we are men of title.
The blood of kings flows through our veins.
Your rash, unfounded accusations can only be looked upon with contempt, sir!
Throw out their luggage!
Bring it out!
Throw it overboard.
You go find my hatbox.
Hurry, you lackeys!
Well, throw it, you idiot!
That should be done with them.
Raise it up.
I hope that an undeserved fate will haunt you forever, sir!
You are obviously not fit...
I told you we shouldn't have pulled the
Cincinnati double shuffle on the first night.
It wasn't our performance, dear boy.
It was their pitiful lack of imagination.
Well, what are we gonna do next?
It's not "what are we gonna do," it is "whom are we going to do."
Now, don't look now, but the next recipients of our estimable companionship are, at this very moment, coming to our rescue.
Ahoy! Ahoy there!
Oh, alas! Oh, woe.
Well, cry, you idiot.
Well, why are you gawking?
Mocking us in our hour of degradation.
Be gone with you!
Be gone, I say.
Do you need any help?
Help?
What help can you give us when fate has fetched us so low, when we were once so high?
Let the cruel world do its worst, but there's one thing we know.
There's a grave somewhere for us.
The world will always go on as it always has, and take everything from us.
Money, property, loved ones... everything!
But they can't take that.
One day we'll lay our poor, broken hearts down in that grave.
The rest... is silence.
Well, what are you heaving your poor, broken hearts at us for?
We're not blaming you.
It's the world that's brought us down.
Where was you brought down from?
Oh, you wouldn't believe us.
The world never believes the secrets of our birth.
'Tis no matter.
Let it pass.
Let it pass.
The secrets of your birth?
Wait a minute.
You have a sympathetic-looking face.
Perhaps you would believe us.
My great-grandmater on my pater's side
Became a baroness
Then great-grandpater died
When later great-grandmater again became a bride
She wed a duke, so the royal strain was doubled when she wed again their son
My grand-pere became the rightful heir
But lost his lofty title in a dubious game of chemin de fer
What a sad demise for the true Dolphine
My Daddy was Louie XVll
Thus I, but for a tragic happenstance
Am His Majesty, the King of France
The King of France?
You're looking at royalty
Royalty
Fouled and foiled, slightly soiled, but
Royalty
Born to reign
All in vain
Fate was cruel, we should be rulin'
Royalty
Tell him about yourself,
Bilgey.
- Well, l...
- Never mind.
The Duke of Bilgewater
A hundred years gone by
Braved the broad Atlantic to give the colonies a try
My grandfather's life was hard and brief
My mother sold matches and died of grief
Thus here, but for a cruel, historic fluke
Is Lord Bilgewater
A full-fledged Duke
You're looking at...
Royalty
Royalty
Fouled and foiled
Slightly soiled
But royalty
Born to reign
All in vain
Fate was cruel, we should be rulin'
Royalty
Well, can't we at least fetch you down to the next town?
No, no. We couldn't think of encroaching on your hospitality.
But since you insist, have your manservant tote our belongings aboard, and let's get outta here.
Come on, Jim.
What should I call you?
Your Grace, My Lord, or Your Lordship?
Well, we're traveling incognito, you understand.
You simply call me King.
Call him Bilgewater.
You may put that there, my good man.
You're looking at royalty
Royalty
Lost our throne, two rolling stones
But royalty
Unlike you, our blood is blue
Fate was cruel, we should be rulin'
Royalty
Shove off. Shove off.
You're lookin' at royalty
You're lookin' at royalty
Fouled and foiled, slightly soiled, but
Royalty
Worn and torn
But
To the manor born
Fate was cruel, we should be rulin'
Royalty
Lower your eyes and bend your knees
You jack-a-napes are gapin' at royalty
I was up all night.
Think I'll take a few winks of sleep.
Tell me, Jim.
You're a runaway slave, aren't ya?
Who? Me?
No, sir.
I ain't no runaway.
I mean you no harm, Jim.
Just seems mighty strange for a young boy and a healthy black like yourself to be shiftin' free and easy here on this raft headin' downriver.
Straight for Cairo... which, as any simple-minded fool knows, is exactly where a runaway slave would just naturally gravitate.
Well, uh...
He ain't no runaway.
You see, King, my folks was livin' in Pike County, Missouri.
It's where I was born.
And they all died off except for me and Pap and my brother lke and our freeborn manservant here, Jim.
That's right.
He's tellin' it right.
Oh, I know he is.
And he's doing a wonderful job.
- Isn't he, though.
- Yeah.
Continue... what'd you say your name was?
Jackson.
George Jackson.
Well, we ran into a piece of bad luck a couple of nights ago.
A steamboat ran over the forward end of our raft.
We all fell overboard underneath the wheel.
Jim and me come up all right, but, well,
Pap was drunk, and, well, lke was only four years old.
Lord rest their souls.
That was a really, very touching story, but... l've had a trying morning.
Think I'm gonna join my friend in the arms of Morpheus.
Move your feet, Bilgey.
Move your feet.
What?!
I've had better accommodations than this.
You think he believed us?
But did you believe him?
I mean, about them being royalty and all?
Well, not all of it.
Well, as long as he believes we believe that stretcher he told us,
I figure he'll go along with ours.
Besides, like Miss Watson used to say, them two just may be a blessing in disguise.
And once he gets you into his clutches, my friends, the demon rum will rot ya through and through.
Rot your body, rot your brain, rot your immortal soul.
Ooh, it was spellbinding, I tell ya.
I was the pet of the womenfolk... big and little.
'Cause we was makin' it mighty warm for those rummies.
We were takin' in a fortune.
Then somehow or other a little report got out that we was puttin' in time with the jug on the sly.
- They run us out...
- Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
Then we... then we took to sellin' an article to take the tartar off the teeth.
And it does, too.
And generally the enamel along with it.
We... we got out of there just ahead of the lynch mob.
Enough, Bilgey.
They were a pack of ingrates.
Boy, put mine over there.
May I make a suggestion, gentlemen?
If I was to make believe to be your slave, why, folks would never question two gentlemen of obvious qualities such as yourselves.
Why, you'd appear to be the owners of a valuable piece of property... namely, me.
And that way, we could all travel together safely.
Brilliant.
Brilliant!
But... but it needs something.
Let me think.
I've got it!
You two wanna make it safely to Cairo, right?
Yes, sir.
It wouldn't hurt to have a little jingle in your pockets when you get there, would it?
You are now members of the
Royal Shakespeare Touring Company.
Good thinkin', King.
Bilgey, I want you to make me up some new posters and tickets... lots of tickets.
"For two nights only,
David Garrick the younger,
"and Edmund Keene the elder.
"Direct from London in their celebrated performance of The Royal Nonesuch."
The play's the thing, boys.
Our dear citizens of this fair, charming, quaint city of Clairville...
Trusting you all know your own names...
...let me tell you mine.
I am David Garrick the younger of the Royal Haymarket Theatre,
White Chapel, Piccadilly,
Pudding Lane... London!
Now star and managing director of the Royal Shakespeare Touring Company.
And now, let me introduce you to the members of my illustrious troupe.
First of all,
Mr. Edmund Keene the elder of the Drury Lane Theatre, London, right there.
Yes. And now, my young ward
Percival Hepplewhite, III, known throughout Europe as the boy genius of Stratford-Upon-Avon right there.
Thank you for your passionate response, sir.
And now, last but not least, perhaps the world's most brilliant interpreter of Shakespeare's immortal character Caliban, the former king of Huggamugga,
King Goonawonga right there.
Assisted by the strength of my entire troupe, with new appointments, new scenery, new props, for just two nights only because of imperative European engagements...
...we will... we will present the thrilling, spine-tingling, inspiring epic from the pen of the Bard himself...
The Royal Nonesuch.
Unfortunately, however, there...
Unfortunately, however, women and children will not be admitted to either performance.
Under any circumstances.
There must be at least a hundred people in there.
More like 163, including standing room.
- Can hardly wait to see the show myself.
- Me, neither.
Full house. Let's go.
You two run along down to the raft with Bilgewater.
Don't we get to see the show?
His Majesty don't like nobody watching from the wings. Come on. Get out.
Why, Tom, you're too young.
Who let you in?
I let myself in.
- Well, let yourself out.
- Hey! Put me down!
Bless you.
Gentlemen and gentlemen...
The Royal Shakespeare Touring
Company is proud to present tonight, for your pleasure...
...the least known, yet far greatest work of the Bard of Avon.
"The Royal Nonesuch."
Also known as "The Tragedy of the...
- of the King's Camel Leopard."
Prepare for rolling heads
Blood that sheds
Right before your eyes
Revenge and hate
The knell of fate
When everybody dies
And, ooh, there's so much more
There's lust and gore
Laughter
Tears
And sin
The Royal Nonesuch has come to town
So let the play be...
Before we raise the curtain on this epic tour de force
Certain pertinent facts
I must convey
This manuscript lay static
In a corner of Shakespeare's attic
Till I by chance discovered it
Dramatically uncovered it
It was a cold and rainy night.
I happened to be a house guest at the ancestral cottage of my dear friend Shakespeare.
Alas, sleep would not come, so I spent the night scuffling about amidst the boxes and the barrels in the loft, when...
Moment of moments...
I stumbled upon this discarded bundle of parchment.
Breathlessly I blew away
247 years of dust.
And lo... there it was.
In the Bard's own hand.
The Royal Nonesuch, a new tragedy by William Shakespeare!
Oh, ho, there's so much more
Than love and war in this great Shakes-perience
The Royal Nonesuch has come to town
The Royal Nonesuch of much renown
The Royal Nonesuch won't let you down
So let
The play
Commence
Come on, come on.
Can't we at least go back and take a look? He'd never know.
That was a triumph.
Let's get out of here.
- Is the show over already?
- Always leave them wanting more.
Get that boy outta here.
What the devil you doin', boy?
We threw you out once.
Belay there.
Let the boy speak.
I just come to tell you there'll be no show tonight.
They all run off.
I saw 'em.
The kid's right!
They're gone!
There ain't nothin' back there.
No scenery, no costumes... nothin' but the piano player.
I sure don't like this Royal Nonesuch business.
Stealin' poor people's money... that's... that's downright dishonest.
Well, you're stealin' yourself from Miss Watson, ain't ya?
Now, stealin' is stealin', Jim.
Well, there is stealin' and there is stealin'.
But this here... is stealin'.
But the King was right about one thing.
Nobody's lookin' at ya like you're a runaway slave no more, now are they?
And, besides, we're only a couple of days from Cairo.
Cairo.
- Why, that's...
- Money in the bank.
Here. You hammer up the rest of the posters.
I'm gonna do a little advance promotin'.
God rest ye merry gentlemen.
Good tidings to you all.
One and all, good tidings.
Hip, hip, hip, hip, and all that rot.
Whiskey. Your best.
You must be the Reverend Wilks all the way from England.
My condolences.
From England, rather, but Reverend Wilks...
Condolences?
Condolences for what?
Your brother just died.
That is, if you was the Reverend
Mr. Wilks, your brother just died... leaving all that money.
Money?
Come here! Forget the signs, forget the posters.
What?
Gentlemen, we are about to raise the curtain on the most lucrative engagement of our careers.
You might even say we were born for these roles.
But we are not gonna perform here in Barrytown.
The stage awaits a few miles downriver in Jackson's Landing. Come on!
Now remember, Bilgey, you're deaf and dumb.
Yes, yes, King.
Fine. And you?
Rather, I say.
Very good. And that's all you say, so remember it.
Huckleberry, I have a bad feeling about it.
This time, they've gone too far.
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
If anybody comes nosin' around here, just get in there and moan and groan.
Let me hear you.
Jim, this is the last of it.
Soon as I shuck these two,
I'm gonna cut right back to here, and we'll be in Cairo tomorrow.
All right, Hucky.
I'll be waitin' for you.
Now, you be careful, you hear?
I won't be long, Jim.
I promise.
Percival, let's get going.
Goodbye, Jim.
Come along, dear boy.
Quick, let's get going.
Jackson's Landing is just around the point.
You row, Bilgey.
Farewell, fellow voyagers.
Parting is such sweet sorrow, but I know that the good Lord, in His kindness, will guide your ship up the river of life.
Bless you, bless you, bless you, ble...
Bless you, bless you.
Bless you.
Bless you.
My poor, afflicted brother here is expressing our profound gratitude for our safe arrival in this haven of the New World after our tedious pilgrimage all the way from England.
Sheffield, England. Amen.
Bless you.
How do you do?
How do you do? Hello.
Hello. Nice day.
Bless you. Bless you.
Can any of you kind people tell us where Mr. Peter Wilks lives?
I'm sorry, sir.
The best we can do is tell you where he used to live as of yesterday mornin'.
You mean... our poor brother... is gone?
If only we had a chance to see him.
It's too much to bear!
- Reverend Wilks?
- Yes. Alas, it is I.
My name is Lot Hovey.
Deacon Lot Hovey.
How often has Peter written of you and your dear wife...
- Margaret.
- Margaret. Of course. Dear Margaret.
And what of my nieces?
Poor darlings. What of them?
I'd be honored to take you to them.
Lead on, Deacon.
Lead on.
Your uncles are here!
Mary Jane, Susan... we are here.
Poor child.
There, there, there. Uncle's here.
Don't cry.
Yes, come to Uncle, dear.
That's it.
Oh, that's it.
Yes, Uncle's here.
Don't cry.
Come, come, honey. Don't cry.
Yes, well, Brother William was just singing a fitting hymn for this solemn...
Oh, Reverend Wilks, could we hear it?
- Yes, out of respect.
- We wanna sing along.
- Please.
- Please.
Well... well, all right.
All right... gentle souls.
Into His hands,
Into His hands
Some day we must come
Some day we must come
Into His wonderful, wonderful hands,
Into His heavenly, heavenly hands
Into His wonderful, heavenly hands
Some day we must come
Some day we must come
Into His hands
Into His hands
Into His hands
Some day we must come
Into His wonderful, wonderful hands
Into His heavenly, heavenly hands
Into His wonderful, heavenly hands
Into His heavenly, heavenly hands
Into His hands,
Into His hands
Into His wonderful, heavenly hands
Some day we must come
Some day we must come
Some day
We must
Come
Amen
So, when we received your dear father's letter, we departed our parish haste post haste, taking our young ward
Percival here with us.
He's been such an aid and comfort to us on our journey.
Poor dear. The only time I get to hear him is when he's eating.
But our main concern is for you, dear children.
- Left all alone...
- Oh! Uncle Harvey?
We almost forgot.
There's a letter.
Father's last wishes.
He wanted us to give it to you immediately upon your arrival, but with...
Completely understandable, my dear.
Go fetch the letter.
Your dear father's last wishes must be carried out forthwith down here.
Because he would not be happy up there knowing that things weren't going right down here.
You're very considerate,
Uncle Harvey.
My calling.
Besides, your dear uncles want to unburden you of all concerns.
God rest his generous soul.
I'm explaining to Brother William that your dear father has willed this house and its furnishings plus $3,000 in gold to you, his dear daughters.
And he has willed the tannery, worth $7,000 and another $3,000 in gold to poor, afflicted William and me.
The gold is hidden in two sacks under some bricks in the cellar.
William... has just expressed a sentiment with which I heartily concur.
We cannot accept one shilling of your dear father's beneficence.
- It's for you.
- No, it's all for you.
No, no, no, no.
It's all yours, dear nieces.
But we will go down to the cellar and fetch it to protect it for you.
So that he may rest cold but joyful.
Those dear, good souls.
Rather.
Be careful. Ow!
Careful, you idiot!
You look over there.
I'll look down here.
Ow!
- These here bricks are loose.
- Get 'em.
Golly dang.
This sure beats... this sure beats
"Royal Nonesuch" all howdy, don't it?
Be aware that it's only the first act.
We're gotta play this one out till the final curtain.
This house alone will bring 10,000, not countin' furnishings... and the tannery.
- Yeah.
- And this $6,000.
Where's the other one?
Here, move this.
There it is.
By the time this play is over, you and I will be gentlemen of leisure.
It's providence, Bilgey.
Providence.
Being relatives to rich dead men and representatives of foreign heirs.
There's the line for us.
No more small time bilkin' hayseeds.
We've found our calling.
By this time tomorrow, we will be rich.
Far away from here.
Who is it?
It's Mary Jane, Percy.
Oh. Come in.
I thought you might need this come morning.
It gets awfully cold.
Rather.
You know, Percy, there's something about you that seems mighty strange.
But there is something about you I like.
Guess I've always wanted a little brother to fuss over.
I'm very happy to have you here, Percy.
I do hope we can all stay together for a long, long time.
Good night, Percy.
Good night, Mary Jane.
Bless you.
Mary Jane.
Susan.
How could I ever hurt them?
Jim's waitin' down on the river.
Gotta get back to him.
What's right? What's wrong?
Try to fight or go along?
How can you win
When every day you make the Devil grin?
Which way is real?
What you're taught or what you feel?
What's false?
What's fine?
And who's decidin' the dividin' line?
I don't wanna hurt nobody
I don't wanna die and burn
But with the Devil always doggin' at my heels
How the devil am I gonna learn?
What's right? What's wrong?
Try to fight or go along?
How can you tell
The road to heaven from the one to hell?
Some folks live wise
Other folks are livin' lies
Can't find my way
But I'll keep tryin'
Till my dyin' day
We've been robbed!
Vandalized! Pillaged! Plundered!
We've been robbed!
We've been robbed!
Vandalized! Pillaged! Plundered!
Give me a hand, Bilgey.
Plundered!
We've been robbed! We've been robbed!
You've been robbed!
You've been robbed!
What happened?
That river rat... that little swindler.
He took the gold.
The sheriff.
We have got to tell the sheriff.
But I just can't believe it...
Well, you'd better believe it, my dear.
That scalawag has shifty eyes.
Come on, Bil... uh, Brother William.
We have to go roust the sheriff and rescue our nieces' gold.
Also, we have to arrange post haste for the auction.
We should've got out of town last night, like I said.
Now we got nothin'.
First of all, shut your mouth, Bilgey.
Don't you know the biggest half of this loaf is yet to be plucked?
Sheriff?
We have a matter of utmost importance to discuss with you.
- Are they gone?
- Percy!
Are they gone?
They went for the sheriff.
I can't live a lie no more.
I just gotta tell you the truth.
First off, I ain't English.
My real name's George Jackson, and I'm on my way to visit my uncle Abner Moore.
What are you doing with our uncles?
Them two ain't your uncles.
They's just a couple of river sharks comin' to skin you for everything you got.
I didn't know just what they was into until I was too deep in it.
So I took your gold away from them last night.
I hid it in the safest place I could.
Well, where'd you hide it?
I can't tell you right now,
Miss Susan.
Not till them two's exposed.
'Cause they'd find a way to get it out of ya if you knew.
Sister, we can trust George here.
There's somethin' about him I like.
Friends, all.
Our dear brother Peter... your good friend and neighbor who lays yonder... has done generous well with his poor daughters that he's left behind in this vale of tears.
But these poor, orphan children are twice blighted.
A sneak thief has come in the night and robbed them of all of their cash money, so that all that they have left is what we are to auction here today so that their Uncle William and myself can take them back to England with a dowry fitting for them to marry well.
Now, what you see before you is a hand-wrought, hand-chased, hallmarked, sterling silver, genuine antique silver tea service with tray.
Do I hear $50?
How well I remember this gorgeous, six-piece tea service.
When our dear mother used to serve finger sandwiches and tea on the lawn of our estate in Sheffield, England.
No doubt she and Peter are gazing down on us at this very moment, hoping that one of you dear friends and generous neighbors will bring this priceless heirloom into your home.
Did you hear that, brother? $50!
- Do I hear 60?
- I'll bet 60.
$60, that gentleman right there.
- 75! Did you hear that, brother?
75... that's beautiful. 75.
- $100 right there.
- 150. That's gorgeous. Thank you.
150 going once,
150 going twice.
Bless you, sir.
Thank you very much.
- What did you say, sir?
165, the man with the beard.
Thank you very much. 165.
- 175! Thank you, sir.
- 175 going once.
Hallelujah! Did you hear that,
Mother and Brother? $200.
$200 going once,
$200 going twice...
Damn! Damn!
Somebody give me a hotfoot.
I thought he was supposed to be deaf and dumb.
The Lord has spoken!
He has His ways!
Let us not question them because they are beyond the comprehension of us poor mortals.
Let us pray!
Dear Lord, what are you trying to tell us?
What are you trying to say through our poor brother's afflicted mouth?
What heavenly thi...
Uh-oh.
Could anyone be so kind as to direct us to the Peter Wilks residence?
Uncle Harvey!
Uncle William!
I'm gonna get the sheriff!
Thank God you're really here!
Get them! Get them!
All right, you two frauds.
You're goin' to jail!
Jail's too good for 'em.
They hoodwinked the whole town.
- They oughtta be lynched!
- Yeah!
Yeah! Let's get 'em!
The idea of you lynching anybody.
Just 'cause you're brave enough to tar and feather some poor outcast women that come along here.
Why, a man's safe in the hands of 10,000 of your kind.
I was born and raised in the South, and I've lived in the North.
So I know the average all around.
The average man's a coward!
Your mistake is that you didn't bring a man with you to lead you.
You didn't go home and fetch your mask to cover your faces.
Half a man like him there yells,
"Lynch him! Lynch him!"
Well, I'll tell ya what you're gonna do.
You're gonna droop your tails and get along home and crawl in a hole.
Any real lynching's gonna be done around here, come back with your masks on!
Go on, get outta here, and take that half a man there with ya.
King, that really was a great speech.
Not bad. It was first delivered by a Colonel Sherburne down in Arkansas when they were about to lynch him.
Figured it might come in handy one of these days.
After you, sir.
Well, I knew it weren't the most reverent place to hide a couple of sacks of gold, but there weren't nowhere else, so I hid it in the coffin last night just before you came down to pray.
Well, I hope you explain to your two uncles that I didn't mean to be irreverent.
Well, I gotta go now.
See, somebody's waitin' for me.
My uncle, you know?
Good-bye, George Jackson.
And if I don't ever see you again,
I shan't forget you.
And I'll think about you many and many a time.
And I'll pray for you, too.
Oh, Jim.
Crocker says the barge'll be here in less than two hours.
Ain't soon enough for me.
Don't like this many on our hands.
I never can tell. Maybe some of them damn John Brown abolitionists is fixin' to ambush 'em on the river.
Happened two months ago near Orangeville. Got away with 17.
- Turned them all loose in Cairo.
- That John Brown's an idiot.
Who's gonna feed them and take care of them?
Set them free. It's a sin!
Alls I know, John Brown says owning niggers is a sin.
Yeah, but that only proves he's an idiot.
How many we got this time?
Twenty-four, countin' the new batch.
Three females and 21 bucks.
All right, let's get 'em ready.
Tie 'em up over here.
Move along now!
Move along!
No. Get away.
No.
She's mighty early, but it looks like the barge is comin'.
Could be.
The river's high, and the current's mighty strong.
Yeah, that's her, all right.
Better get 'em ready.
- When did he go?
- Just now.
Nigger Jim, d'you hear me?
You all come back before I kill every damn nigger in this stockade.
Stand up!
I know you're in there somewhere.
Jim, no.
All right.
Just you listen to this!
Other slaves in there are bought and paid for.
He'll never do it.
Now, that's one!
Now either give yourself up, or I finish off the rest.
Jim, no.
No. It's a trick.
I swear to ya.
It's a trick, Jim.
Come on.
He ain't gonna fall for that, and you know it.
Once Crocker gets here, we'll put the dogs on him.
Then he won't stand a chance in hell.
Let's get 'em ready for the barge.
Huck... Huck, I can't run no more.
I got... I gotta rest.
I'm all cramped up from bein' tied.
Jim...
Your blood's red... the same as mine.
You didn't know that before, Huck?
It was wrong of me...
I mean, it's wrong for you... for me to let you be out here with me like... like this.
Runnin' the risk of bein' caught like a... a damned "abolutionist."
Huck, I've been lyin' to you all along.
You been lyin'?
You don't need to run from your pap no more.
You don't need to run from anythin'.
You know that... that dead body
I found in that wrecked houseboat?
That was your pap.
I... I wanted to tell ya.
I wanted to tell ya right there, but...
I was... I was scared. I...
I was scared you'd run off and leave me
'cause you didn't need me no more and... well, I needed you.
You did the right thing back there.
I might've run off on ya.
I probably would've.
But now... I don't give a damn what the whole world says.
'Cause if I'm doin' wrong...
...well... well, I hope
I roast in hell forever!
- I can't...
- Gimme your shirt, Jim!
- What?
- Just gimme your shirt!
Now, the raft's on the river, a quarter of a mile or so in the cove.
Now, Cairo's just five miles on the other side.
Ain't you comin' with me?
When you get there, have somebody write a letter to
Judge Thatcher back to Hannibal for ya.
Say where you are,
'cause I'm gonna have the Judge send you your wife and your little girl.
Alls it takes is money, and I still got all of mine saved with the Judge.
I know I can spring enough loose for that.
No, Huck. That's... that's your money. I can't...
But, Jim, you're gonna open up a dry-good store in Cairo, ain't ya?
We'll need them to help us run the business.
We're partners.
Right?
Partners. Remember?
Right.
God bless you.
If there is a God up there... and I ain't sure if there is or there ain't... he'll hear me prayin' for ya, Jim.

It's a new release. I was gonna play it myself. I'll give it to Doc, what the hell?
- That's a nice move, man. Thank you.
- That's very nice.
Let's get this major piece of heaviness out of the way.
Albert Driscoll, vice president of Billings Corporation...
The name sounds familiar because you've seen it on your check every week...
He's sending us a Regis Lamar.
What's a Regis Lamar?
A Regis Lamar is a brand-new flunky sales manager.
Driscoll's sending him here to turn our ratings into dollars.
Oh, man, not again?
Give the dude a ride through Bel Air.
Buy him a nice dinner.
And get him so stoned he thinks he got laid.
And send him home first class.
Alright, look... I don't think we take it so lightly this time.
The guy's got heavy credentials.
He's also got big corporations, government, and I hear the army.
- The what?
- You heard it, the army.
Driscoll's sending the dude here to get these big accounts to put spots on our station.
Hell, Dugan.
We've spent years trying to beat them.
Now they wanna join us?
If we let them get away with one, they'll start shoving them at us.
They'll start overselling, over-commercializing, till they drive our goddamn station into the ground.
What do they care about our audience?
What do they care about music?
All they care about is money.
We gonna let them do this to us?
- No way!
- OK! Case closed!
- Let's get onto some good news!
- The dope is here.
- Are you kidding me?
- The dope ain't here.
But what is here is a Linda Ronstadt concert that's happening.
No way! Carlyle and KLAX have got that locked up.
- Oh, they do, huh?
- They do. They are sponsoring it.
Well, I got a little idea about how we can steal that concert right from under Carlyle and broadcast it live.
KLAX is gonna sponsor it and we're gonna broadcast it?
- That is pisser. That is pisser.
- That's a pisser.
Not only that, we're gonna do it without them ever knowing about it.
Shit!
Listen, Dugan, if you do pull off that Ronstadt thing, I got dibs on MC!

How about you and I having a couple of drinks after work?

Where have I heard that?
Oh, excuse me.
Eric, sweetheart, how are you?
I've been trying to get ahold of you for two weeks.
Are you still my agent?
I was down in Palm Springs,
I had to talk to the ex-wife. What a pain!
I tried to call you. What's the problem?
The problem, Jack, is a gameshow.
That's the problem.
You wanna MC something like "Blind Date" or "King Of The Hill"?
You want me to throw you into any show that comes along?

I'm working on a very big deal.
'That's thrilling.
Keep me posted, Regis.
'Dugan, you and Regis getting along OK?'
- Yeah, fine, Al, just fine.
- 'Good, good.
'I thought the two of you would work well together.
'Take care of yourself, Jeff.
You're too valuable to lose.
- 'So long.'
- Yeah, so long, Al.
- Alright, how about a toast?
- Good idea.
To profits and the quality they bring.
To quality and the profits it brings.
I'll drink to that.
Doc, can we talk?
Yeah, go ahead.
How do want me to say it? The book?
The numbers aren't there.
Come on, you know how it is.
One day, they're with you...
...the next, they're someplace else.
Well, it looks like for me they took a permanent move.
It's a shitty business.
Sometimes it's real shitty.
Yeah, OK, Dugan.
Now, what's the bottom line, Dugan?
Where's things at?
I want Laura there full-time.
And, er...
What do I do, sell Chevys on TV?
Work a disco?
Do a record hop, huh?
♪ Remember me,
I'm the one who loves you...
Ronnie White called the other day.
Just coincidence, Doc.
He wanted to offer you a full-time job.
A.M.?
A.M. ain't where I'm at.
You can have the weekends, if you want.
Throw in part-time here and there.
You can stay with us that way, if you want.

For those of you who never knew, for those of you who've never forgotten, for those of you who really don't give a sh... damn, this is Laura Coe for Doc Holiday on QSKY Radio.
Back from an extended vacation, a perfectly divine holiday...
Well, Doc still knows this business better than most.
He'd make a damn good general manager at some smaller station.
Yeah, right. Well, let me know if you hear of anything. Thanks.
Jeff, I'd like you to meet
Lieutenant Reach.
Hi, Jeff. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Just call me Bill.
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you the other day.
Charlie...
Can I get you a drink or something?
Hell, Jeff, old boy, I brought something real special for you.
Do you mind if I close that door over there?
Well, I've only said no to the army once, that's when they wanted me.
Oh, that's a good one.
Charlie, get the drapes.
Excuse me, Regis.
That there is a hell of a view, Jeff.
A hell of a view.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, this here stuff is genuine, three-star personal stock of the General himself, flown straight from Southeast Asia to the Pentagon, with only one little ol' stop in between.
Mmm... Mmm...
You know... a lot of the big guys at the brass figure this is the reason that we invaded that damn country in the first place.
Mmm...
Of course, a lot of the other boys figure that this is why we lost the damn war.
Hell, I guess there's two sides to just about everything, know what I mean, Jeff?
These just came for you.
- Thank you, Alice. That's very nice...
- No, Laura, I had nothing to do with it.
Jeff did it.
He must've ordered them himself.
Doesn't he manage to do just the right thing just at the unexpected moment?
What we decided to do was to get together a group of marketing specialists...
...and to package us a bunch of commercials.
You know, the kind of stuff...
...that would appeal... to the cream of the crop.
The young ones, the late teens, the early twenties!
- Well, you know what we're after.
- Oh, yeah.
Jeff, I guarantee you are going to love this.
Regis?
It's terrific.
Yeah! Yeah!

Oh, God, I love it!
Oh, oh... Jeff, Jeff...
Jeff, the reason we selected your station to do the advertising in the first place is because of old Regis here.
Regis... he guaranteed us that you had the kind of audience that we were interested in.
It's terrific, huh?
I, er...
I think...
I think those spots are damn unique.
That's what I think.
Could you sign something very special for this young lady? Thank you.
Thank you!
Hey, I'll tell you something, if you guys don't score tonight, turn your pens in!
- No problem!
- Who taught you how to write anyway?
But, er... I'm not a disc jockey, you know. I'm nobody.
Oh, OK.
Alright, ain't that a hot old tune, huh?
Kind of makes you wanna take your sweetie closer and boogie all night long, so let's get on down.
We don't wanna stop now, we don't wanna lose the mood.
We're gonna keep 'em coming, fast and steady and back to back.
From Tower Records, this is Mother on QSKY-FM Los Angeles.
Mother! Mother!
Mother, over here!
Excuse me.
- Did you get hers?
- Excuse me.
- OK, guys, that's it. Bye.
- Wait a second, where you going?
Er... I have a dinner date.
A dinner date? With who?
I thought we were gonna keep it professional not personal.
- Yeah, but, er...
- But what?
But, er... I'd like to change that.
You would?
OK, we'll talk about it tomorrow. Bye.
Jeff! You hired Laura back, huh?
Outta sight!
Listen, Dugan,
I really can't understand you.
I send you a cut of "American Slang" a week before anybody else and you haven't played it once.
Who you kidding? You been sneaking that piece of crap to every station in town.
- Come on, Jeff...
- Come on, Izzy!
- Go eat it, will you?
- Funny!
I got an appointment with Lt. Reach tomorrow and I need your decision.
- Tell him I'm thinking about it.
- You're thinking about it?
You're thinking...?
That account's worth $125,000.
Maybe a hell of a lot more to the rest of Billings.
Bobby, I don't want you practicing the news in the toilet anymore.
So from now on, the jocks don't do the news, you do.
- Really?
- Yeah, really.
Every day, morning, noon and night, live.
God, thanks, Jeff. Thanks a lot.
- Whoo! You earned it.
- That's great.
Hi, Regis.
I plan to talk to Reach about a package, putting those spots on all ten of our stations.
What do you think?
Thrilling, Regis.
Maggie?
- Maggie?
- Hey, Dugan. How you doin', good-lookin'?
- Haven't seen you in a long time.
- I know. You look terrific!
- Let's break this up.
- Oh, yeah...
Dugan, have you made the down-payment on your tux yet?
Because if you don't have that tux, you can't get into my concert.
Just think about it.
Little Maggie has made this all possible.
Linda Ronstadt, live in concert!
It's gonna be a biggie, Dugan, and you're not gonna wanna miss it.
Wow, Mr. Carlyle, this is a surprise!
Can I have a minute of your time...?
- I wanna talk to you about that concert.
- What concert?
Linda Ronstadt.
You mean the one that Carlyle's putting on?
That's exactly what I wanna talk to you about.
- I'm sorry, I don't drink.
- How about dinner?
- I'm sorry I...
- Don't eat?
Regis, look, er...
See, I make it a practice not to involve myself socially with anybody in this business.
Things just stay friendlier that way, you know what I mean.
I guess so.
Well...
That's what makes you different from the others.
Would you close my door, please?
- You really want it that bad, huh?
- Yeah, I want it that bad.
Now, isn't that just so, so hot?
Yeah, this is Mother telling you, if you find it, or you got it, then you just better keep it.
Now, what d'you think about that, hmm?
Regis... I've racked my brains over this one, and I just don't see how those army spots fit on our station.
But there is a way, if we produce the copy ourselves.
Let our jocks cut it.
I think it can work.
I mean, dig the Prince...
"Hey, brother, what's happening?
"Now, what's the most important thing in your life?
"A foxy lady.
"Well, how you gonna get one?
"With a nice new shiny uniform, you strut your stuff, man!
"It's what it is."
Or... Mother:
"Hi. This is Mother talking to you.
"Tucking you in, making you feel so warm and cozy.
"You wanna make your Mother happy?
"Join the army."
- What do you think?
- Terrific.
- What about the schedule?
- Huh...
Well, I don't see how we can put those spots on twice an hour, prime time, and not sound like we're owned by the army.
Hmm... Reach would never go for it, not without the schedule.
And I wouldn't blame him.
You're right, Regis. We'll have to let the army go somewhere else.
Huh?
We don't need 'em.
We don't need Reach.
Listen... Listen to that sound, huh?
We got the best damn station there is.
- That's not the point.
- What did you say?
- That's not the point!
- Well, what is?
Profits.
- We make money.
- Not enough.
- Not enough for who? For you?
- The company!
Screw the company!
I promised them a station not a bank.
This deal's too big to pass up.
I'll go all the way to Driscoll if I have to.
Then you better get going.
'Stay tuned to QSKY, my little darlings,
'cos Mother's got a big surprise for you.'
- And for Michael J. Carlyle.
- Attaboy!
If we don't hurry up, he's gonna be welcoming us.
Don't worry about a thing, my little pigeon, it's all taken care of.
Oh...
Driver, would you do me a favor and try to pick it up just a little bit?
- I'd like to get there tonight.
- Of course, Mr. Carlyle.
- Hey, Frank, how you doin'?
- Fine, just fine, Dugan.
- They're expecting you.
- Whoo! Look at you! Alright!
- Look at this.
- This is it!
- Hey, Frank, this is Shari. Shari, Frank.
- Hi, Shari.
He's gonna tell you everything you need to know, OK, babe?
Listen, Frank, I want you to know
I appreciate this a lot, OK?
- Yeah. Thanks, Dugan.
- OK, have a good night.
Whoo!
Your change, sir.
- How did the audition go?
- Great. I was absolutely incredible.
- I'll bet you were.
- Eric's gonna be the next Johnny Carson.
Or maybe the first Eric Swan!
Boy, look at you!
Swan Lake in person.
- This is a concert, not a bar mitzvah.
- Ha! You know Jack.
- How you doin'?
- This is Laura.
Listen, I gotta see you soon.
Don't get lost.
- Nice going.
- You never told me...
- And what are you gonna do...
- Hey, man, how are you?
- ...if it backfires, my dear?
- Hey, nothing's gonna backfire.
- Hey, Tino, how's it going?
- Check everything's alright with her.
- Dugan, I gotta talk to you.
- Ah, yeah, sure. You know each other?
- I think so.
- Linda tied up?
- Yeah, she's in with the press.
- I'll catch her in intermission.
- I gotta make sure everything's OK.
- OK. I'll be over here.
- Hi!
- Hey, darling.
- Jeff, how do I look?
- You look beautiful. Tonight, make it good.
- Gonna make it cosmic!
- Alright.
- But is my make-up...?
- Ask Laura, she knows.
Listen, don't worry about Carlyle, OK?
Ooh, am I taking care of Carlyle!
I've never seen anything like this.
The guy's gotta put gas in the goddamn limousine!
Oh, Michael, relax.
We're gonna get there on time.
Really we are.
Oh, your diamond just snagged my nylons.
Oh!
♪ It's hard to leave when you can't find the door...
Excuse me, Laura!
Laura, Laura, Laura, Laura... I need you.
- Is this natural make-up?
- Oh, it's so natural...
Cathy, tell me, do you have any interest in showbusiness?
- As a matter of fact, I'm very...
- Jack, keep an eye on Cathy for me?
- Oh, sure, Eric.
- It's star time and I'm just a little...
Yes, it's me! They recognize me.
How much make-up can I have on?
Mother, are you ready?
Yeah, we'll be ready in about 10, 15 seconds.
Yeah, OK.
Can you hold on a second?
- Yeah, Jeff?
- How's it going, man?
I dunno, 10, 15 seconds, alright?
- Signal's perfect.
- Alright, let's get going.
Thanks, man.
Alright, guys, come on.
House lights down.
- We're ready whenever you are.
- OK. We're ready.
And house lights out, please.
Come on, house lights.
House lights out.
Come on, house lights... Thank you.

What? Oh, shit!

The department of energy said the demand for petroleum products is going up far faster than usual for this time of the year.
The department released figures comparing the four weeks ending September 23rd with the same period last year.
The department said the demand this year was up six and three tenths percent, and it said imports were up almost ten percent.

Hello, test. Hello, test.
Eric. Eric.
Eric Swan.
OK.
Jesus.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen in the television audience, and welcome to "Tunnel Of Love" with your host Eric Swan.
Good evening, television viewers, and welcome to "The Eric Swan Hour".
Hi... I'm Eric.
Just a short while ago, the Big Apple
City Council voted their unanimous consent to a ballot referendum that would legalize casino gambling in the city...
- 'Jack Rapp here.'
- Hi, Jack.
- It's Eric.
- 'Hi, Eric.'
Listen, what happened?
Come on, tell me. I'm in a great mood.
- 'Er... listen, Eric...'
- Uh-huh?
'Eric, what the hell did you do?'
What do you mean?
'Don't "what do you mean?" me!
'I mean, I got a call from Schuler himself, the producer, remember?
'He's screaming his head off, he'll never give me another drop of business
'as long as I send someone like you around.
'Are you trying to ruin me?'
- Jack, I don't understand, er
- 'Don't understand what?'
I don't understand what you're trying to, er... tell me...
- 'Well, you listen.'
- ...or say.
'I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
'Now, Schuler said you would not take direction,
'he said you kept coming up with your own ideas,
'telling lousy jokes, not even relating to the audience,
'walking around as if it was the goddamn "Eric Swan Hour"!'
Jack, I was just trying... to show them a little bit of my personality.
'Ha! According to Schuler, either you don't have one or the one you got stinks!
'Get yourself another agent!'
This is Bobby Douglas on QSKY Radio.
That's all there is to the mid-afternoon news.
And now more music with Eric Swan.
Um... that's...
More terrific music with Eric Swan!
You're on!
You're on the air right now!
You're on! I mean, on!
I'm done with the news! I'm finished!
It's my first broadcast!
Come on, Eric...
- Bobby, for how long?
- I dunno, a minute, two, three, five!
OK, just shush.
What you were just listening to, ladies and gentlemen, was side one of Marcel Marceau's new hit single.
Well, it's not a hit yet, but we think it will be.
And don't forget, you heard it here first on QSKY-FM.
Now back to something a little more traditional.
This is Eric Swan.
Alright, it was very good. I mean, it was very, very... It was brilliant!
Thank you.
- Bobby, I can only do that once.
- Yes, I know that.
- OK. And you can only do that once.
- I hope so.
- It really was good, though. It really was.
- Thank you, thank you.
Now do me a big favor.
Send Cathy in here, will you?
- OK.
- Thank you.
- Huh?
- Bobby, it's not "huh".
It's a question.
Just have Cathy come in, OK?
Well, she's not here. She left.
I thought you knew.
What do you mean?
Thought I knew what?
Well, er... she came in this morning and, er... quit.
She said she got a better job.
With, er...
- With...
- With who?
With Jack Rapp, your agent.
We all thought you knew that.
Yeah, I knew that.
I knew that.
That's funny, er... sometimes...
...we file things, you know, and we forget them.
- Sure.
- I knew that.
OK. Thank you.
Bobby?
Yeah?
Erm...
Where's Dugan?
Well, he went out to lunch with Alice.
It's her birthday.
Laura and I are going over there now.
That's great. OK... OK.
- Eric?
- Yeah.
Are you alright?
No, I'm fine.
Thanks, kid.
Oh, you know those D.J. tapes you did?
I'm giving them to Alice.
Laura, you know Eric doesn't know anything about Cathy and Rapp.
- Is he alright?
- Well, he seemed a little strange.
Do you hear that?
It's not what you think it is.
It's a human heart. A very happy sound.
You hear this?
- 'It's an empty heart.'
- See, it's just creative radio, Booby.
It's a little strange for creative radio.
Well, look, if it'll make you feel better, go get Dugan.
- You want me to take him off the air?
- Dugan makes that decision.
I'll stand here, keep an eye on Swan...
- And I'll go get Dugan.
- OK.
'Tell me I can love you and you can love me, please.
'Can someone love Swan?
Someone?'
Come with me, and this'll be our song.
'There. Nice.'
It's ours. Who are you?
Call me.
I don't know who you are.
You do.
You know who you are.
So call me. I don't know...
All I know are two things.
I need love.
And we're listening.
Please call.
'Let me love you, and I will never leave you.
'Call me.'
I had a love once.
A lovely, lovely lady.
All I wanted was to share everything, everything, with her.
To walk hand in hand... down sunny streets.
'Buy her... fresh-cut flowers.'
To caress her breasts and...
'...kiss her thighs, take Polaroids.'
- Oh, God!
- 'But it wasn't meant to be.'
Not for me. Why?
Why, I ask you.
Without love, we're like unattached planets, just...
...just drifting without meaning, alone in the universe.
Please... 555-QSKY.
Please call.
If the lines are busy, just try again.
'I want someone. I wanna feel again.
I want love once more.'
Knock it off!
'Who's gonna walk hand in hand with me?'
Eric! We can talk now!
'I want it... I want it...'
Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Come on!
- 'Please call me.
'I love you.
I wanna feel love once more.'
We still got a license or has he gone too far?
- A little shaky.
- Bobby, get him off the air.
Please...
Oh, God!
Excuse me.
Hello?
Oh, bless you, Debbie, sweetie.
'You're 5' 8"?
And sixteen is a grown up.'
I agree. Yes.
You're so sweet to call, really.
Come here. I gonna go in through the service panel.
I think you better go out there and help Alice, OK?

And it's not because I can't handle it, cos I can, I can handle it just fine!
I just don't want to, not anymore.
But you have made a name for yourself, you're what this business is about.
- Don't you think you...?
- Laura, please! Please!
If it works for you, that's great.
I mean, bon voyage, congratulations, all the best.
But if I don't wanna be a rock 'n' roller all my life, don't come down on me.
I mean, just don't come down on me!
It's not all that bad, is it, huh?
No... No, it isn't.
It's just I've been at it for a long time, a real long time, and I still feel like I'm missing something.
That's all.
That's all I want. I want a...
I want a chance to see if it couldn't be better for me some other way, that's all.
OK?
OK.

- Hi, I'm Jeff Dugan and...
- Laura Coe.
And we're rapping down with Tom Petty! Oh! Alright!
- How goes it?
- Pretty good.
- Nice sound.
- Thank you.
- You've been out on tour, right?
- Yeah, about six weeks now.
Um... how was the tour for you?
- Was there a good response?
- Yeah.
- Fine? Good experiences?
- Nice and sweaty, excessive tours...
Would you excuse me? You guys are having such a good time, I'll see you later.
Well, thank you. Er...
Well, what do you say we talk about the European tour in a little bit, and listen to "Breakdown" from
Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers?
OK, that was good. I got it all.
Hey, Bobby Douglas. How are you?
Look, Al, when I took the job,
I said, "Understand my attitude.
"We may not have the richest station in town,
"but we will have an audience, a loyal audience."
That's right, you told us.
Now tell me this.
Where's the logic in taking this station to number one and we don't make any more profit?
I'm not against making money, Al.
But you guys, you're never satisfied.
You come in here and you dilute the sound, you oversell the commercial time, you put on spots whether they fit or not, and, in the end, you negate everything that was good in the first place.

Listen, Mr. Driscoll, we're not throwing this away!
This is no light-weight comical trip here, we are keeping this place until your pud falls off, if we have to!
No one respects Jeff's accomplishments here more than I do.
But let me remind you,
I never fired him, he quit!
You made him quit!
This discussion isn't getting us anywhere.
Where's that guy from the union?
Cirullo, come here.
Now, this is Mr. Cirullo.
He's the head of your union.
And this takeover strike, as you call it, is absolutely illegal.
Now, not only won't they support you...
To hell with the union!
They need us more than we need them.

We have just received a court injunction ordering you to vacate the premises.
You have three minutes to do so.
You know, Jeffrey, we could get our asses handed to us for this.
You know, Eric, it couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of people.

Come on, do it.

Oh, man, my picture!

Wait... you're making a mistake.
Come on!
'Stop it, will you? Please!
'Please stop!
'Stop!'
Hold it!

We started this because we wanted to give you what... you wanted.

We haven't lost here, I mean...
What good's a radio station if nobody listens to it, right?
We'll give you what you want.
And if we can't do it here... we'll do it someplace else.

And I admire the respect that you can command that creates this kind of loyalty.

- No, I don't mind. Come in.
Cheers.
- What's the matter, then?
- She's misfiring a bit.
Yeah?
It's your plug.
Got some tools on the bike. Hold up.
I'll go and have a look.
Gis a go at this.
You'll break your leg off that.
No wonder you wear them big boots.
That's the best bike ever made, mate.
I got a ton-five out of that the other day.
- Sure.
- Better than that poxy hairdryer.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Well, that isn't it, is it?
I mean, it isn't the bikes, is it?
It's the people.
And the people who ride these are states, third-class tickets.
- Do what?
- Well, rockers.
All that greasy hair and dirty clobber.
It's diabolical.
I don't give a monkey's arsehole about mods and rockers.
Underneath, we're all the same.
Nah, Kev, that's it: I don't want to be the same as everybody else.
That's why I'm a mod, see. I mean, you gotta be somebody, ain't you?
Or you might as well jump in the sea and drown.
That's why I joined the army.
To be different.
To get away from all this.
Don't matter where you go, there's always some cunt who wants to push you about.
Run it, please.
Two bob.
I'll see you.
- Three fours.
- No, no, that's bollocks.
- Three of a kind don't beat that.
- It bloody well does!
- Who says?
- I do.
He's right, you know, Harry.
Will you run it, please?
Your deal, Des.
I was late.
She was waiting.
In the wrong place.
And by the time I found her...
Could you get us some of those
French blues, then?
I'll have to see, won't I? I dunno.
You in?
One card. Down and dirty.
Make a mod out of you yet, Harry, eh?
I don't think, though, they make Levis in your size.
Bollocks.
You and me.
- All right, I'll go.
- Three.
- Two bob.
- For people like you.
- I'm out.
- So am I.
You are a fucking jammy bleeder, Cooper.
You're getting chicken, Des.
Look, I only had an ace.
I gotta go off to Broadwick Street now.
- Take some stuff up there.
- Run that film again, please.
Shall we get out?
Oh, yeah, Des, I don't like to be cruel.
Here y'are, take it all back.
It's yours, you won it.
That's the ten bob I owe you.
Fuck off, I ain't carrying all that fucking change about.
You take it or leave it, me son.
Take it or leave it.
I'll see you later, Harry. See you, Des.
Mr Cale sent me up to collect some stuff for Broadwick Street.
Yes. I've been waiting for you for over an hour.
Yeah.
Come on, hurry up.
That stuff's got to be over there fast.
F-A-S-T.
Watch the cloth, moth.
What a tacky Herbert.
- Do you wanna hear it?
- Yeah.
Number two.
- Oh, boy.
- What you gonna do tonight, then?
Wait for a phone call, I suppose.
- I'll see you later, all right?
- Bye.
Wotcha, Jimmy.
What you doing here, then?
- I was waiting for you.
- Yeah? What for?
- I thought I'd give you a lift home.
- Great.
- Steph?
- What?
- You goin' to Brighton this weekend?
- Yeah. You?
'Course I am. Who are you going with?
Pete's taking me.
It's gonna be good, innit?
Yeah. Good.
You and Pete getting a bit strong, then?
Nah, 'course not.
He's a laugh, that's all.
Bit flash, though, ain't he?
I wouldn't be with him otherwise, would I?
Nah.
- Suppose not.
- Hey, you jealous?
- 'Course I ain't.
- Nah?
That's a pity, I thought you was.
- It's the technique.
- All right, boys?
What are we gonna do about pills?
If we're going to Brighton, we're gonna need millions.
I wanna get out of me head for a start.
Wouldn't be too difficult with your little monkey brain.
Get some rockers out their heads when we're there, knock 'em off.
- I was thinking about getting a gun.
- Don't talk bloody daft.
Here, I get my suit tomorrow.
Only 'cause you wanna screw Steph, innit?
Jim!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Get off.
- Get outside.
- We're goin', aren't we?
- Let's go.
Let's go up the Goldhawk, lads.
Look, tomato sauce.
It's all watered down.
The rolls have got scabs on 'em.
Shit.
- Get off it a sec.
- Spider!
Here, look, lads.
- What's up, then?
- Dunno.
- Break down?
- Must be, the brakes are down.
- We'll see you down there, then.
- Ten minutes.
- You'd be better catching a bus!
- We will, then.
- Shit.
- What's the matter with it?
How am I supposed to know what the matter is?
Oh, shit.
What's the matter?
Your mother's hairdryer blown up?
- Rubber band busted?
- Yeah. Let's fix it.
Let's fix it.
Hold on, we don't do nothin' for nothin'.
Look, why don't you piss off?
Bloody leave us alone.
Hold on, Lenny, they don't want our help.
Which one are you? The boy or the girl?
It's hard to tell with you lot.
This one's a bird. Give us a kiss.
Piss off, all right?
Bastards!
This one's the bird!
She got tits!
Let go!
- Spider!
- OK, let's go!
Spider!
So long, sucker!
Fuck off!
Bloody hell.
I've just seen Spider.
He's taken a right kicking.
- What?
- Some rockers have had him.
- He's outside.
- Where?
On the stairs. Come on.
Spider, you all right, yeah?
What's this about rockers kicking your head in?
- Gonna murder the bastards!
- You lot, come on!
- Come on!
- You stay there, right?
- What are we gonna do?
- Fucking kill 'em!
Right. Are you with me?
- I'm with you.
- They're all going to meet death!
We're gonna fuckin' murder! Murder!
There they fucking are!
Christ!
Fuckin' hell!
'Ave him! Fuckin' 'ave him!
Fucking greaser!
Jim!
You wanted it, didn't you?
No, no, fuck off! Leave him alone!
No, leave him alone!
Where's he going?
All right, run!
- Leg it!
- The fuckin' law will be here!
- What time do you call this?
- I don't know, I haven't got a watch.
Don't come funny, lad.
It's nearly midnight.
Don't worry, I ain't gonna turn into a pumpkin, am I?
Anyway, you're pissed.
George, what's going on?
Cunt.
I've been sitting up for more than an hour waiting for you.
- I can do without your clever remarks.
- George.
- Who do you think you are?
- I don't know. You tell me, eh?
You're barmy, you are, staying out all hours.
Getting up to God-knows-what, dressing up like a freak.
Stand still when I'm talking to you.
Wouldn't be at all surprised if you're not on drugs.
I know what you get up to down that club, you and your mates.
You've gotta be part of a gang, haven't you? Gotta be a mod, or this, or that.
Haven't you got a mind of your own?
I'll tell you what's wrong with you.
You're schizophrenic.
- What's that, then?
- I'll tell you.
Somebody, like you, who doesn't know if his mind's over here or over there.
Bloody split personality.
Half your mother's family were the same.
I suppose that's where you get it.
Your Uncle Sid was always trying to kill himself.
And when he did, it was a bloody accident.
He never knew if he was coming or going.
Bit like you.
- What happened to him, then?
- He got drowned, didn't he?
Fell down a bleedin' well in the garden.
Go on, get off to bed.
Jimmy?
Jimmy!
Come on, you. You're late as it is.
- Jimmy!
- Don't.
Come on, wake up!
- I'm not well, Mum.
- What?
I can't go to work, I'm not well.
Oh.
Something wrong with your head, is it?
Look at you, lying there in all your clothes. It's not normal.
I can't stand here. I've gotta get on.
You make sure you go to the doctor and get a certificate. You hear?
Yes.
Hang on, what about them blokes
Pete's always on about?
What, always got bags of it?
Straight out the back door of the chemical factory?
It's fucking rubbish.
Sort of bollocks you expect from that flash cunt.
It's worth a try, though, innit?
I'm gonna pop...
- It's not like you got no work to do.
- All right, George, half a minute.
- I'll pick you up later, all right?
- Yeah, all right.
Do you want a push start?
No, thanks.
Hey, Jim, I'll be on me own bike again tomorrow, won't I?
I'm getting the scooter back.
- Burn the arse of your rust bucket.
- Any time.
Butch! Jenny! It's all right.
Go on, get back in there.
All right, young Jim. On holiday?
Nah. Just fancied the day off.
You'll be getting like them beatniks.
Ban the bomb and do fuck all for a living.
You're all right, ain't you?
Just you and your Uncle Charlie.
You don't have to bother with a load of cunts like I do.
- Well, you know what I mean.
- No, I don't.
If you don't work, you don't get no money. And I like money.
Pete, what about Brighton this weekend?
What about it?
Pills. Me and Dave thought you might be able to get hold of some.
Why me? I'm not a fucking pusher.
No, no. But you know some blokes who are, don't you?
Not me. Charlie's mates.
And I'm not about to start blabbing me mouth off about mates of Charlie's.
They're fucking big, these blokes.
They don't mess about.
Anyway,
I don't know why you're worrying.
- Ferdy'll have some.
- Ferdy ain't been seen, has he?
He'll turn up. You watch, Friday night he'll pop up like a jack-in-the-box.
Or a golliwog.
Ain't bloody here, is he?
Cunt. I wonder where he is.
- I don't know.
- This place gives me the shits.
- Bleedin' nig-nogs everywhere.
- Shut up.
It's like bleedin' Calcutta round here.
Calcutta's in India.
West India, that's where they bleedin' come from.
What's so funny?
- Just who are you looking for?
- Is Ferdy in?
He not here. Him gone out.
Thank you.
- Looking for Ferdy.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
He's gone out.
Oh... yeah.
Stitchin' me up and all, the bloke.
Fucking...
Peter Fenton?
Peter!
Thanks.
Hello, Peter Fenton. Who is it?
- What d'you wanna ring me up here for?
- Listen, you cunt, tell us where we can find these blokes or we're stuck for Brighton.
Yeah, OK. This time.
- Hold this, then.
- What for?
I ain't going in there with me parka on, am I?
Hey, Jim.
Excuse me.
- What d'you want, son?
- Is Harry North about?
- Who are you, then?
- I've got a message for him.
Hang about a minute, all right?
Come through here. Come through.
Come through.
Over there.
Through here.
That's him over there in the grey suit.
Go on, you're all right. Go on.
What can I do for you, son?
- Me Uncle Charlie.
- Who?
Charlie Fenton, he said...
- Are you Charlie's boy?
- His nephew, yeah.
Oh, his nephew. What's your name, son?
Jimmy.
It's a pleasure and a privilege to meet any one of the Fentons.
- Now, do you want a drink, son?
- No, thanks.
- I gotta get going soon.
- What can I do for you?
Listen, you can have a talk here.
We're all pals.
- I wanted some pills.
- Oh.
What do you want?
Purple hearts? Blues? Dexedrine?
Some blues. I've got a tenner.
No, not here, son.
Teddy, come here.
This is Teddy. Go for a walk with him and he'll do the business for you.
- All right.
- Give my regards to your Uncle Charlie.
Pillhead.
Come on, Ronnie.
Come on, Ron!
Tosser.
Chalk...
It's all there.
250 leapers! This'll see us through till Christmas, eh?
- Show me.
- One for the road, eh?
Come on, hurry up.
That ain't a blue! That's paraffin.
We've been done, that's my three quid down the drain.
Yeah, and mine!
Let's do the bastard's motor.
Come on.
Get out the way!
Come on! Go!
You on?
Wankers!
Nice.
Give it a shove. Go on, shove it, man.
Nice one.
You're fucking making a racket.
- Do we have to do this?
- Course we do.
We don't wanna leave fingerprints all over the gaff.
They'll catch us on the smell.
Shut up.
We must be able to find some blues here.
Look at that.
Oh, yes.
- Dave.
- What?
Come here.
Shut up!
- Fucking shut up!
- All right.
This place...
- Here, Jim, I just had a thought.
- What?
- Footprints.
- Footprints. What?
You got lines on the back of your feet.
There must be thousands of pills here.
Or millions.
Nothing's there.
I'm gonna search in there.
I'm putting me socks on. I ain't stupid.
Police!
Hey, lads, look at these.
- Johnnies, hundreds of 'em.
- Chuck us a couple of packets.
- Got something planned for tonight?
- 'Course I have.
Oh! Fucking yellows.
Chalky, what you doing?
Come and give us a hand.
Not taking no chances, am I?
Come on, shut up.
Let's get down to it, eh?
I've found 'em. They're blues.
- I found some blues.
- There's not many.
- Perhaps someone's been nickin' 'em.
- Fucking hell!
Hang on!
Chalky, come on.
Just getting something for me mum.
- I'm dropping all the blues.
- Just get out.
- All right.
- One and tuppence.
OK. And you behave yourself tonight.
I'll try.
I'll try and behave myself tonight.
I'm flying. Terrific, ain't they?
- Did we have it off, or what?
- Just what the doctor ordered.
- We done your chemist tonight.
- You didn't.
I was gonna phone you.
Why didn't you?
I coulda told you where everything was.
Got you a Pepsi.
- And a present.
- What is it?
- You nicked 'em, didn't you?
- You are now handling stolen goods.
Here y'are, I'll give you some more.
Listen, d'you fancy taking me home later?
What about Pete, then?
I'll worry about Pete.
But if you tell him, I will never, ever speak to you again, right?
Don't worry, I won't tell him.
And I'm still gonna go down to Brighton with him.
- Yeah.
- I've said I would, haven't I?
Yeah, I suppose so.
♪ Girl, you really got me now
♪ You got me so I can't sleep at night
♪ You really got me, whoo
♪ Please... don't ever set me free...
Oh, cheers.
How much d'you get?
Mr Fulford had a few words to say about your unexplained absence yesterday.
- Like what?
- Like don't do it again.
Unless you want to end up hearing him read the riot act. I take it you don't.
No, I'd rather be dead, Mr Cale.
All right.
Off you go. You too, Eric.
Have a nice weekend.
It's just the front
I'm a bit dodgy about.
The only way to keep that up is with lacquer.
- I don't want any lacquer.
- Just a drop.
- Poofs wear lacquer, don't they?
- I wear lacquer.
That's what I mean, innit?
- There y'are.
- Cheers.
My bird'll pull that back for me.
As long as that's all she pulls back.
- Right. Usual miracle?
- Watch the neck.
Plenty of lacquer for him.
You know the hair falls? Down the back.
- Know what I mean?
- All right.
- See you, then, Dan.
- Yeah, cheers, Jim.
- Brighton tomorrow?
- Yeah, see you there.
Mum? Mum?
Where've you put all them old newspapers?
Are you gonna get my carpets wet again?
No, I've given 'em a really good wringing out.
They're under the sink.
Gordon Bennett!
What have you got on?
Is this some kind of new fashion
I haven't heard about?
- Sopping wet trousers?
- They're Levis.
Never mind what they are, they're bleeding wet.
You've gotta shrink 'em on you so they fit right.
He's definitely getting worse.
- What's this rubbish, then?
- Ready Steady Go!
- Ready what?
- Ready Steady Go!
Ready Steady Go!?
Bunch of louts.
Bloody moron.
I suppose they wear wet jeans n'all, do they?
Is that how you're supposed to play a guitar now, then?
Oh, gawd help us.
Here, have you seen this?
I haven't got time for all that rubbish.
I can sing better than that little ape.
Call that singing?
Sounds like a drowned dog.
That'll make you deaf, you know.

Good morning, it's 6.01, and here is the news.
After yesterday's session at the conference, the Colonial Secretary commented that he hoped for a speedy transition to independence in Aden.
The Bank Holiday started in earnest last night, with thousands of motorists heading towards the south coast.
Traffic was reported heavy on the A127, the Southend Road, and there were jams on the M1 southbound, causing severe delays.
Shopkeepers in Brighton, fearing a reoccurrence of disturbances caused by rival gangs in other seaside resorts, put up shutters last night.
A spokesperson for the shopkeepers said while they weren't expecting...
- Watch it, Dave!
- I'll burn you off any day, son!
I thought you got that thing fixed up!
Show off!
Oh, shit.
Fuck off!
- Flash pig.
- He thinks he's Davy Crockett.
- Lend us a mirror.
- Piss off!
Chalky.
Hold the bike. Hey, Chalky!
- Chalky, you all right?
- Hey, Chalky!
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Anything broken?
- No.
- Shame, eh? Shame.
Nah, it looks all right.
Looked good from back there.
Don't take the piss,
I nearly broke me fucking neck.
You look all right.
What we'll do, we'll go and get 'em.
Follow us up.
Told you I'd burn you off any day, didn't I?
- Hang on a bit.
- Serves you right!
- See you down there.
- Jimmy!

Look at that. That is Brighton, my sons!
Blindin'. T'riffic. All right, lads!
Nice one. Ron!
Brilliant! Ace!
Here they are!
- Let's get down there. Come on.
- What about this? Everyone's here.
- This is great.
- Great. Brilliant.
Hey, look, look, there's Bonzo.
Bonzo!
- So, when did you get down here?
- About half an hour ago.
We left this morning, before it was light.
- What was it like?
- It was dark, weren't it.
Cor, look at him.
- Don't he look smart?
- Wallop!
Look at the scooter.
That is ace!
So, what happened to you last night?
- That'd be telling, wouldn't it?
- That would be telling, would it?
Chalky.
Thanks for waiting. Bleedin' turd.
Where'd the bird go?
He's doing well.
How many you want?
He's out of his head.
Come on.
- You come up?
- I'm really up there.
Fucking great!
- Greenwich Village.
- Where?
Greenwich Village.
It's a commune in New York.
The geezer with the hair, man.
Oi, Dave.
The one with the hair.
Let's go and watch him.
- Jim?
- I'll see you over there.
Monkey, come and dance.
- All right, there, Steph?
- Hello.
Great dancer, eh?
He must be the Ace Face.
- Good looking.
- You wanna dance with a face?
- All right.
- Come on, then.
See ya.
Come on.
Come on, let's dance over there.
- No, let's dance over here.
- I wanna watch him. Come on.
- Why d'you wanna go?
- I wanna dance. Dance with yourself.
- Look at him.
- What's he think he's doing?
- Right, out the way, son.
- Out the way, come on.
Fuck off.
Oi, bouncers!
Come on, out! You stupid little bastard.
- Could've killed yourself.
- Leave him.
Jimmy!
Monkey!
Get out and stay out.
Bit of a girl, was she?
- Boys, where we going?
- Come on a ride.
No, I'm gonna find somewhere to kip.
You seen Jimmy?
Last time I seen him, he was getting kicked out.
- Fenton's pulled.
- Don't it make you sick?
Got his sleeping arrangements sorted.
- Chalk, let's ride.
- Nah, we wanna be fresh for tomorrow.
- See you, Dave.
- Cheerio, Spider.
Steph, you coming with us, then?
No, I don't fancy kipping on dirty floors.
Going to a bed and breakfast, ain't we?
Bye.
I wouldn't say no to bed and breakfast either.
- I ain't got no dough.
- Not you. Them.
Oh. Yeah, not half.
Can you imagine it?
Legs wrapped round your face.
Fucking amazing.
Bit of all right, is that Steph.
- So where we gonna kip.
- I dunno.
I've got no fucking idea.
What we gonna do? Go back up?
- On the beach.
- Oh, yeah, can you swim?
I don't wanna go to sleep anyway.
Do you?
What d'you reckon?
It's cheap.
It's a bit of a shithouse, innit?
I dunno,
I've never slept in a shithouse.
- What d'you reckon?
- Well...
- Make your fucking mind up.
- Fucking hell.
Sorry. Is there room?
- Fucking hell.
- Sorry.
Who's farted?
Come on, then, let's make a move.
Come on, get a move on.
- I've heard there's a few mods about.
- See you down there.
Fucking hell.
- What d'you want?
- Egg sandwich.
Spider! You shithouse!
Hello, girls. Where's Jim?
He's over there.
How's the human cannonball...
Leave me hair alone, will you, Dave?
We go down this beach hut.
It's dark, right?
We wake up, there's greasers everywhere.
Right, Dave?
Yeah. They was all having a screw with some bird.
- Bit rough, was she?
- He don't know, he only saw her arse.
Yeah, but that wasn't rough.
Well, apart from the splinters.
One of 'em was the geezer that rode me off the bike yesterday.
He's on my fucking list. He's dead.
- It's all right if I sit down, then?
- Yeah.
What you got the hump about?
So why are you so humpy?
It's nothing.
Just looking at the sea, that's all.
Oh, Christ Almighty.
Take your feet off the table.
Piss off.
Just watch it, or you're out.
- Where'd you get to, then?
- Nowhere.
I just kipped on the beach.
You're fucking mad, you are, getting chucked out.
You should have stayed around.
You would've been well in.
- What d'you mean?
- She was there on her Jack Jones.
- Steph?
- Yeah.
Fucking Fenton gets off with this beatnik chick.
And she's all on her own, ain't she.
I tell you...
I would've been up her like a fucking ferret.
Well, if I hadn't know that you and her were so...
So what?
I ain't gone on her, you know.
Leave it out, everybody knows you fancy her.
I reckon she's a right good bunk-up, lads.
You animal!
- Hi.
- All right, Steph?
- Great, innit?
- Where's Pete, then?
- I dunno. Don't really care.
- Don't really care. Dave!
Come on.
We are the mods! We are the mods!
We are, we are, we are the mods!
We are the mods! We are the mods!
We are, we are, we are the mods!

We are, we are, we are the mods!
We are the mods! We are the mods!
We are, we are, we are the mods!
We are the mods! We are the mods!
We are, we are, we are the mods!
That's the geezer that rode me off the road yesterday.
Let's fucking have 'em!
Shut those fucking doors!
Have him!
Pete, stop 'em!
Get somebody here quick.
What's that? Stop!
Jesus Christ, they've gone... Oi!
Get 'em in here quick.
What's going on here?
Over the edge.
- Jimmy!
- All right!
I was there! The mods! We were there!
Look! Dan did that!
There was a geezer, I tell you,
I went crack!
Crack!
You bastards!
We are, we are, we are the mods!
We are the mods, we are the mods!
We are, we are, we are the mods!
- On my life, he was going...
- Quick!
Fucking hell! Run! Run!
We are the mods, we are the mods!
We are, we are, we are the mods!
Jimmy!
Chalk! Dave!
- We just got some rockers.
- We just done the caff.
- We pushed 'em off a wall!
- What's that on your...
Kill the bastards!
Leave him alone, you dirty rocker!
Oi, what the fuck!
Get out the way!
Come on!
Steph, come on!
Come on.
Come on, Ace!
Christ, the law!
- Leg it!
- Run!
Right, keep them in!
Control those kids.
We are, we are, we are the mods!
We are the mods, we are the mods!
We are, we are, we are the mods!
- Come on!
- Run! Run!
Up here! Come on.
Dogs! Dogs!
Come here. Come here.
Bloody hell.
Here, come on.
Down here.
Come on.
Get onto the footpath!
Get onto the path!
Spider! Come on!
Get off me! I ain't done nothing!
Jimmy!
- Right, get him in here!

Steph, come on.
Oh, no!
Fuck!
Get off!
All right! All right!
Get off! You cunt.
Cheers.
All right.

It seems strange to see this procession of miserable specimens.
So different from the strutting hooligans of yesterday, who came here to pollute the air of this town.
Yes.
These long-haired, mentally unstable, petty little hoodlums.
These sawdust Caesars, who can only find courage, like rats, by hunting in packs, came to Brighton with the avowed intent of interfering with the life and property of its inhabitants.
And so far as the law gives us power, this court will not fail to use the prescribed penalties.
It may perhaps discourage you, and others of your kidney who are infected with this vicious virus, that you be ordered to pay a fine of £75.
I'll pay now if you don't mind.
You haven't got a pen, have you,
Your Honour?
- All right...
- Be quiet!
- Take that man away.
- Silence in court.
James Michael Cooper.
You stay right where you are.
At least I don't have to ask where you've been this time.
Do you think this is clever?
Proud of yourself?
- No.
- What do you mean no? You was there.
- And them animals you call friends.
- Yeah.
And I suppose you had some more of this filth with you, didn't you?
You can look shamefaced, my lad.
I've a good mind to get the law on you.
Where'd you get these?
I dunno. Someone gave 'em to me.
Did he?
And of course, you had to take 'em.
- No.
- You've gotta look big.
If he'd said they was rat poison, you'd have taken 'em, then gone off like a pack of savages, ruining everybody's peace and quiet.
I look at you and I don't know what I brought up.
- Your sister's not like this.
- Ain't she? What do you fucking know?
Drugs and filthy pictures!
Running riot everywhere!
You're a little animal, you are.
You wanna be locked up!
I've done my best, look what
I've got for it! A bloody mad thing!
You're a little savage!
Get out of my house! Go on! Get out!
All right.
You're no son of mine!
Wait till your father comes home.
- Oh, yeah, I'll wait.
- Go on, get out!
Yeah, fuck off!
Who wants to live in your fucking house anyway?
♪ Get out and don't come back no more
♪ Get out and don't come back
♪ No more ♪
Come.
The postroom boy.
Be with you in a minute, Cooper.
Absent for a full day last week, Cooper.
Now I understand that one day's Bank
Holiday is not good enough for you, so you have to take two.
May I inquire if there's any reason for this?
- Not really.
- Not ill or anything, were you?
No.
Mr Cale tells me that you spent the weekend in Brighton.
I imagine that you were involved to some extent in the disturbances there.
Yeah, I was there.
You weren't arrested or detained or anything, were you?
No.
I must say, I find your attitude fairly incomprehensible.
I feel I must warn you, Cooper, that we cannot tolerate this kind of absenteeism amongst our junior staff.
You've a good steady job here, Cooper.
Plenty of young men'd give their eye teeth to be in your shoes.
Yeah? Well, find one, then.
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard. I said find one, then.
I'll tell you what you can do with your eye teeth and your job.
You can take that mail, and that franking machine, and all that other rubbish
I have to go about with, and you can stuff 'em right up your ass!
Hey, Jimmy.
What did you do?
Lose a shilling and find sixpence?
- Well, look who it isn't.
- Jimmy! I thought they'd locked you up.
Yeah, I got fined, didn't I. Fifty quid.
- Jesus.
- Another good customer bites the dust.
Sorry, but we couldn't hang around for you.
- We had to get back to our jobs.
- Yeah? Well, I ain't bothered.
I was with Ace and that.
Yeah, we went to court together.
Yeah.
Christ, he's really weird tonight.
I couldn't give a shit.
- Ferdy.
- Jim.
- You got any blues or anything?
- Yeah. How many you want?
Dunno. Well, how many you got?
- A ton. French blues.
- Yeah, I'll have the lot.
- What?
- You can't afford it.
Where'd you get all that, then?
Golden handshake, innit?
Two weeks' money.
Told him to stuff the job right up his ass, didn't I?
- You sure you want the whole bag, Jim?
- Yeah. Why not, eh? Why not?
All right. A fiver.
A fiver.
What are you gonna do with that lot?
- Start a one-man riot?
- Yeah, I might.
- Jim, why'd you chuck in your job?
- 'Cause I felt like it.
You're bleedin' nutty.
- You was on a cushy number.
- Don't give it all that.
I just got fed up.
Fancied something outdoors.
So do I, eh?
She's not bad, is she?
I found her by the road in Brighton.
Maybe there's some trouble at home.
See you found yourself a new little boy, then.
Hey, Jimmy. I hope you find a new job.
Oh, yeah?
I could always get you a job on the rubbish carts.
She says you're good at going up and down in alleyways.
If I see you round here again
I'll fuckin' kill you!
- Get off me!
- What's the matter with you?
- Cunts! Get off me! You're not a face!
- Piss off!
- You piss off!
- Forget her, Jimmy.
You shut up and piss off!
You're all wankers and cunts!
Wankers and cunts!
- Jimmy! Pack that in and clear off!
- What do you want, you old spunker?
Right.
What d'you want? What d'you want?
I'll have you, you little bastard!
Are you mad? What's the matter with you?
You're worse than he is.
- Go back to bed.
- Come on in.
- You wanna wake the whole street up?
- It's a bit late to worry about that.
If he comes near this house again
I'll kill him.
Do we have to shout about it down here?
Do they all have to know our business?
- Hello, Steph.
- What you doin' here?
- I wanted to see you.
- Well, now you've seen me.
- Wait a minute, will you?
- What you gonna do? Beat me up?
All right, what d'you want?
Walk, I'm late.
Well, I left home last night.
- I kipped out, didn't I?
- In some nuthouse?
Look, I ain't mad, you know.
What is wrong with you, then?
Well, I dunno, it's just it seems like everything's going backwards, that's all, Steph.
You sure it's not you that's going backwards?
No, it's just...
I can't think straight, that's all.
I mean, nothing seems right, apart from Brighton.
I mean, Brighton was OK.
Going to court with the Ace and that.
And, like, I was a mod there, you know?
- I mean that's something, innit, eh?
- Oh, what are you talking about?
Brighton was a laugh. That's why we went down. It was a giggle, that's all.
Oh, yeah? And me and you, then?
- Was that just a giggle?
- What do you think?
All right, so I fancied you.
We had it off together.
- But that don't mean nothing, does it?
- It did to fucking me!
Well, I can't help that, Jimmy, can I?
If I'd known you were gonna go off your nut...
I told you, I ain't fucking mad, right?
No, not much. Look at you.
One minute you're all right, the next you're going stupid.
You can't even have a bit of the other without kicking your mate's head in.
Just leave me alone, all right?
- Steph, please.
- Look, fuck off!
You slag! You cunt!
Bastard! Slag!
What the bloody hell you doin'?
We could've killed you.
Look at this.
Oh, fucking look what you done!
- You cunts!
- Roll the van back, mate.
You've killed me scooter! Fuck off!
Leave it alone, get off it!
- Fuck off!
- Dent in it...
Take it easy.
Fucking leave it alone.
Get off! Get off it!
There it is, on the floor now.
- You're lucky you ain't been killed.
- I'm fucking lucky, am I?
- Course you are.
- You're a bastard.
- I didn't see you.
- Fuck off! Go away!
Fifteen years of driving,
I've never had an accident.
Never had a fucking accident.
You got me! Why didn't you kill me?
All of you fucking Mr Postmen!
Fuck off!
- Come on, let's do our report.

Ladies and gentlemen!
200 motels
200 motels . . . Life on the road!
Ladies and gentlemen! and here is . . .
Who?
Larry the dwarf!
Larry likes to dress up funny
Tonight he's dressed up like Frank Zappa
Let's ask him "What's the deal?"
Hi Larry, it's good to have you back on our panel.
Hi Dave, it's really great to be back on your panel.
I'm sure the people at home would be interested to know why such a large dwarf as you is all dressed up like Frank Zappa.
Tell us Larry, eh . . . what's the deal?
He made me do it, Dave. He's such a creep.
He's making me hold this alladin.
And why is he making you do that, Larry?
He wants me to fuck the girl with the harp.
He wants you to fuck the girl . . . with the harp?
No, no, with the magic lamp. He wants me to stuff it up her and rub it.
Hm. Hm-hm-hm. Ho-ho-ho, ha-ha. A-HA-HA-HA-HO-HO.
Let's ask our studio audience. If you'd just been lowered down here on TV by a wire connected to a brown leather harness, forced by a crazy person to insert a mysterious, imported lamp into the reproductive-rep-rep-rep into-into the rep-rep-reproductive orifice of a lady harpist and you were a dwarf . . . would you do it?
YES!!!
Yay!
Let's spin the big wheel, Larry! Go ahead, give it a whirl!
What our studio audience doesn't know is that the reason Larry the Dwarf is doing all this stuff is because its all part of the score to 200 Motels. Every word, every action, the lamp, the reproductive orifice, it's all in the score, so he has to do it. This whole event is a fantasy that occurred touring on the road. Touring can make you crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
That is precisely what 200 Motels is all about.
Say!
Ow! Look out!
Ow! Look out!
Ow! Look out!
How long?
How long?
Till that mystery roach be arrivin' soon
Ya-ooo Ya-ooo Ya-ooo Ya-ooo
That mystery roach be approachin'
That mystery roach be approachin' me
La La La La La La La, Oof!
How long?
How long?
Till that mystery roach been gone
Ya-ooo-ooo-oo-ooo
Ya-ooo-ooo-oo-ooo
That mystery roach be approachin'
That mystery roach be approachin' me
La La La La La La La, Oof!
That mystery roach be approachin'
That mystery roach be approachin' me
La La La La La La La, Oof!
Mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery roach!
Mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery roach!
Mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery roach!

Mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery roach!
Mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery mystery roach!
Room service?
Ah . . . a mystery roach . . .
What are we SINGING about?
We must be . . . FLIPPING OUT!
Special delivery for Mr. Volman! Mr. Volman?
Are you Volman?
It's a double cheeseburger from a famous American burger chain, with a symbol in the parking lot that's yellow plastic and goes like this:
RANCE MUHAMMITZ . . .
RANCE MUHAMMITZ . . .
RANCE . . .
RANCE MUHAMMITZ . . .
RANCE . . .
RANCE . . .
MUHAMMITZ . . .
MUHAMMITZ . . .
MUHAMMITZ . . .
. . . In a steaming briefcase!
You're Volman!
Yeh-No. No. He's Volman. Who are you?
You must call me "Rance Muhammitz."
"Rance Muhammitz"? Stupidest name I ever heard of.
Yah, but you must remember that within the conceptual framework of this filmic event, nothing really matters! It is entirely possible for several subjective realities to coexist. It is possible that all things are a deception of the senses.
Right on, Rance! The functioning of our senses has been spiritually impaired and chemically corrupted by the fake, artifical food coloring.
By the way. Mr. Volman, I have . . . YOUR CHEESEBURGER.
We must evolve.
Yeah . . .
We must progress.
Progress . . .
There must be growth!
Yeah . . . macrobiotic foods and tie-dye shirts!
Hey, ya ain't gonna eat that cheeseburger, Mark? . . . (BURP)
Fucking guy will eat anything.
This is registered delivery, you will have to sign for it.
Sure man, I'll sign. Where's the pencil?
I don't wish to alarm you, my son, but the signature will have to be . . . in blood.
Listen man, I just wanna know two things. Is there any beer in this fake nightclub, and when do we get paid?
Just-just a minute, just a minute, in a moment or two you'll be able to get your hands on all the imaginary beer that you want. For the moment, I would like to explain some of the things that you'll all be doing in this movie.
I've been wondering about that.
For Sherwood, we have a vacuum cleaner scheduled . . .
A vacuum cleaner?
. . . and a potential epileptic seizure during a production number later on.
A vacuum cleaner!
I thought the two of you would like to get acquainted.
It says here that you are supposed to be in love.
This abnormal relationship will be great for the big story I'm going to write!
Listen man, I just wanna know one thing: when do we get paid?
No look, look, look, look, look, don't you even care what you do?
So long as I get some beer and I get paid, you can make me do anything, I'm professional!
You should be careful talkin' about that stuff.
Why, does he listen?
He always listens. He always watches and listens to all the guys in the band. I've been in the band for years, and I know. He always listens.
That's how he gets all his material! It isn't s'posed to be natural, friendly, good-natured, humorous, ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, YEAH, WELL FINE!
. . . and then he rips it off, and he sneaks off into a secret room someplace, and boils it in ammonia, and he gets it perverted, and THEN he brings it back to us at rehearsal and makes us play it!
Hey man, what's that over there?
It's HIM. You can see him, he's watching.
D'ya think he heard us?
I've been in the band for years. You can bet that he heard everything.
Yeah, let's go over and pretend to be nice to him.
Yeah, let's go over and pretent we don't know he's watching.
Yeah, and rippin' off all our good material.
Hi, man!
Hi, Frank!
Hi, man!
Hi, Frank!
Hi, man!
Hey, Frank!
Hey, that's a GREAT new song you wrote, you know, the one about the penis and everything? I was laughin' a lot the whole time I was learnin' it!
Yeah, we were all laughin', Frank!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha YEAH, WELL FINE!
Yeah, it took a little while to get into it man, but once we got the drift, phew!
Yeah, there's lots of great parts you've got in there for the chorus, you know when they go:
RAN-TAN-RAN-TOON-RAN-TAN-TAN . . .
And I steal the room and everything, you know. I don't even mind you rippin' it off from me, just as long as I get paid.
Oh, and I don't even mind the part where he says, "what can I say about this fabulous elixir," so long as me and
Howard and Jeff Simmons who left the group just before the movie started get credit for special material! Ha-ha-ha!
I'm deeply offended by your lack of artistic sense.
Look here, Muhammitz, or whatever the fuck they call ya, I don't even give a shit man, I got five fuckin' kids at home and . . . can you lend me a coupla bucks until the end of the week? Who are you, anyway?
Oh, she writes for the Imaginary Rock and Roll newspaper in San Francisco.
San Francisco?
Man!
Oh! Eh, he's making me leave here now.
I'll see you later when we play.
What?
I don't expect you to understand that, because uh, we haven't formed the group yet.
Ah, Mark will play the bass . . .
Ba-doom-doom-doom-doom . . .
Howie will sing and play sax . . .
Dwee-dat-dwee-dat-dweet-dat-dwee-dat . . .
I'll play the guitar . . . woop-doo-doo-doo . . . and the dwarf here will play drums!
Waittaminit, waittaminit, waittaminit, waittaminit, waittaminit! This guy isn't even a dwarf!
That's one of the reasons the group will be so commercial!
Ah. What about the other guys?
Ah, they're already forming groups all over the place! Why wait till the end of the movie, we could have a hit single right now!
He's right, he's right! We don't need Aynsley . . .
No . . . We don't need Ian . . .
No . . . We don't need George!
No! We don't need anybody! Argh!
No!
He needs us, remember. We don't need him! All those other guys are too old for rock. They're out of it! We could have a tight little heavy little band with this dwarf here. You know, that he, he used to play drums for Leon Russell . . .
Ohh . . .
Listen, you're right. Zappa's 30.
Yeah, man.
Ohh . . . whew . . .
Thirty years old . . .
Oh, he's out of it man! He's too old, he should retire.
Yeah, really. You can't trust old people. You know, we should take up a collection and buy him a watch.
I don't know too much about this stuff
I've been a little busy
This won't take long
Just a few questions
This won't take long
Just a few questions
This won't take long
Just a few questions
Just a few questions
This . . . won't . . . take . . . long . . .
This . . . won't . . . take . . . long . . .
This . . . won't . . . take . . . long . . .
This . . . won't . . . take . . . long . . .
I hear birds!
What's he saying?
You took the mystery burger! You are in full posession of
. . . the burger! Do you know who I am? Hm? Do you know
Who I really am?
Really man! WHO . . . DO YOU THINK . . . YOU ARE?
Yeah, do you want me to tell you WHO . . .
I really think you are?
Yeah, somebody tell me WHO is this guy?
Centerville
A real nice place to raise your kids up
Centerville
It's really neat!
Churches
Churches
And liquor stores
Oh, yeah! It's
Just like Glendale
Look!
Over there
It's a rancid boutique!
Janet, did you see those guys with the hair?
It's those guys from the fake stage across the street from our house.
Eww, I get so excited when someone from a group gets near me. I just . . . eww, I just . . .
Don't you have any taste? That one guy's got gray hair, and the other one's too fat.
Oh, they look so lonely.
Lonely? Good evening honey, they look desperate. Desperate pop stars are so depressing when they've been on the road for such a long time, and they finally get some action.
They drool on you.
Really. All that stuff that comes out of their mouth when they're on top of you. It's so moche. Ew.
Ew, on the pillows.
But I like the drummer with the rivets on his clothes, he's not bad.
Yeah, I've seen him too. He just screams
"Englishness," with that little haircut and the rings . . .
And the binoculars.
Binoculars?
Didn't you notice his binoculars?
No, he's got binoculars?
He watches us through them, he's a pervert!
Oh, I get so hot just thinking about perversions . . . Maybe when we go down to the fake nightclub tonight we can meet him, and find out if he really is perverted.
Just take my word for it; he is perverted.
Mmm. And English, too.
They're all that way.
This town
This town
Is a Sealed
Tuna Sandwich
Sealed Tuna Sandwich
With the wrapper glued
It's by baloney on the rack
Rant-tant-tant
Tant-tant-tant
Tant-tant-tant
It goes for 40 cents a whack
It's just a rancid little snack
In a plastic bag
From a matron in La Habra with a blown-out crack

Yeah . . . but come on in this place,
An' I'll buy you a taste,
'N you can sit on my face--
Where's my waitress?
OPAL, YOU HOT LITTLE BITCH!
Yes, Jimmy Carl Black, Indian of the Group, what can I do for you?
Mo-honnitz! What are you doin' here?
You just called me, didn't you?
All I said was "Opal, you hot little bitch".
I am known by many names.
Mm-hmm. You got many friends who call you
"Opal the hot little bitch"?
Please-please-please-please Mr. Black, let us cut the small talk, and get on with your briefing.
Fine, you can brief me all you want as long as you can tell me two things . . .
I know, when do we get paid . . .
No, I wanna know where's that waitress,
Yes, waitress..
And if she comes in this place, will she sit on my face, and loan me a couple bucks until the end of the week.
. . . couple of bucks . . . . end of the week . . . week . . . week ending, the week ending, what-what that, what's the date?
Uhhh, Tuesday was the 5th, uh Monday was the 3rd, uh make that out for Sunday-
Eh-eh-eh, don't say Sunday!
What's wrong with Sunday?
Eh!
The Lord's day! Br-r-r! A day of rest! Br-r-r! Just make that sucker out for the 23rd of March, wouldya?
Very well, Mr. Black. Oh, by the way. I have here the special beer I promised you earlier.
Oh man, it's about time, I've been waiting.
Would you care to sign for it?
This is a pencil?
No, Mr. Black, it is a pin.
A PIN?
Would you jab yourself in the finger with it?
Listen, Mo-hannitz, I may be professional, but I'm not THAT professional. I just want my beer.
Sign first! In blood.
Fuck you! Who do you think you are, the devil or something?
I am known by many names.
You probably got some more weird names for yourself, but I'll tell you one thing you ain't nev-, definitely ain't never gonna be called and that's the devil, because you ain't the devil.
Oh, I'm not?
You bet your sweet ass you're not. The fuckin' devil's got an english accent.
I seen him three weeks ago on TV. So you know, you can just take this big needle here and hang it in your ass as far as I'm concerned! (cough) Fuckin' guy musta been a communist!
Hello there. When you go on tour with a musical group, it's possible that any town can seem like this.
Whether it's large or small, or busy, or if there's nothing happening in it.
The reason for this is quite simple. A musician, if you consider the normal pattern of modern civilized life, is on the outside of it all.
He doesn't build things, he doesn't work regular hours like a decent god-fearing citizen, and the life he leads, in many ways, seems useless and irrelevant to those of us who'd prefer a quiet evening in front of the television and a bottle of beer. Amazing as it might seem to some of us, musicians have basic physical needs, just like real people. Many of them study for years, learning to play the violin for instance, only to be rewarded with a humdrum job in the fourth row of a symphonic string section.
That's why the governments have constructed, at great expense, this experimental reorientation facility.
To find a way, perhaps, to retrain these useless
To find a way, perhaps, to retrain these useless old musicians with their brown fiddles and little horns.
Give them a trade! A reason to exist in the modern world! A chance of a happier, more productive life.
Some will enter the military, some will learn shorthand, and some will disappear in the middle of the night on a special train they're sending in.
It's the only way, really, to bring about the final solution to the orchestra question.
I'm sure that many of us realize that a pop group can earn a vast amount of money compared to these other kinds of musicians. That's why the special government agencies for mass response programming and psychological stultification prefer to treat them in a more subtle manner.
They know, just as many of you vigilant and thoroughly upstanding citizens have discovered for yourselves, the power of pop music to corrupt and putrify the minds of world youth are virtually limitless.
Ooh, the way you love me, lady,
I get so hard now I could die

Well, there are a lot of reasons why I'd . . . I'd drag a girl such as yourself back to this . . . plastic hotel room and . . . rip you off for spare change to run a

They're driving me crazy.
Hey, look what's comin' through the door!
MUHAMMITZ . . .
Ah, it's really great now . . . more paper, more paper . . . page two..

Yes! Oh, show me a little ass! Oh, scuze me

Man! This stuff is great! It's just as if Donovan himself had appeared on my very own TV with words of peace, love, and eternal cosmic wisdom . . . ! Leading me. Guiding me. On paths of everlasting pseudo-karmic negligence, in the very midst of my drug-induced nocturnal emission.
For I am your good conscience, Jeff. I know all. I see all. I am a cosmic love pulse matrix, becoming a technicolor interpositive!
Huh? Where'd you buy that incense? It's hip.
It's the same and mysterious exotic oriental fragrance as what the Beatles get off on.
I thought I recognized it . . . Sniff, sniff . . . Mmm, what is that, MUSK? Sniff, sniff, sniff . . . mmmh!
Jeff, I know what's good for you.
Right. You're heavy.
Yes, Jeff, I am your guiding light. Listen to me.
Don't rip off the towels, Jeff!
Piss off, you little nitwit!
Hey man, what's the deal?
Don't listen to him, Jeff, he's no good. He'll make you do BAD THINGS!
You mean, he'll make me sin?
Yes, Jeff. SIN!
Wow!
Jeff, I'd like to have a word with you . . . about your soul.
No, don't listen, Jeff.
Why are you wasting your life, night after night playing this comedy music?
You're right, I'm too heavy to be in this group.
Comedy music . . .
Jeff, YOUR SOUL!
Oh, ah Oh, you're wasting your life
To be . . .
Ah Oh, ah Ah, ah
Too heavy, Jeff
In this group, all I ever get to do is play Zappa's comedy music. HE EATS!
Jeff!
I get so tense!
Of course you do, my boy.
The stuff he makes me do is always off the wall!
That's why it would be best to leave his stern employ.
And quit the group!
You'll make it big!
That's right.
Of course!
And then I won't be SMALL!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ti-diddly-diddly-dee
Ha, ha, ha . . .

Cough, cough. Ahmet Ertegun used this towel as a bathmat six weeks ago at a rancid motel in Orlando, Florida, with the highest MILDEW rating of any commercial lodging facility within the territorial limits of the United States, naturally excluding tropical possessions . . . It's still damp. What an aroma! This is the best I ever got off! What can I say about this elixir?
This is the real you, Jeff. Rip off a few more ashtrays. Get rid of some of that inner tension. Quit the comedy group!
Get your own group together. Heavy! Like GRAND FUNK! Or BLACK SABBATH . . .
No, Jeff . . .
Or COVEN!
Peace . . . Love . . .
Bollocks!
What can I say about this elixir?
What?
WOWWWWWW!
What can I?
WOWWWWWW!
What?
What can I say about this?
WOWWWWWW!

Does this kind of life look interesting to you? Night after night, dinners with Herb Cohen. Thrill-packed, fun-filled evenings on the French Riviera at the MIDEM convention. A fake tie, the whole bit. Watch Mutt eat, and Leon feed the geese. One thousand green business cards, with your name and the wrong address. Plus six royalty statements, inspected and customized by Rantoon
Tan, Hantoon Frammin, and DEE . . .
Followed by twelve potential suicides as the members of your group, past and present, find out they can't collect unemployment. A dog, a car, an epidemic of body lice, with your own record company, your name on the door, electric buzzer to the inner office, and Ona's tits, and a three month supply of German bookings with tickets on Air Rangoon.
Does this kind of life look interesting to you? As a fake rock and roll guitar player in a comedy group?

I'm going to die. I know I'm going to die, I can tell because my pulse is so weak. The pills . . . I took so many downers that I know this is the end for me.
You poor thing. You want us to fix your hair for you so you look good when they find you?
Oh . . . would you?
Sure, whaddyawant? A ponytail? A flat-top with fenders?
I'm gonna die, Janet, I'm gonna O.D.! So, make me look good.
Listen, the best I can do for you is fix your hair, so why don't you get up and wash that melted eye makeup off your face.
Is it smeared? I've been crying so much . . . it's so damn sad when you know you'll never see all your friends anymore.
Every week it's the same old thing. You're gonna die. You're gonna die. Somebody went out on you. Somebody doesn't love you anymore. How long you been a groupie? You should get used to romances which are so obviously cheap. Listen, just in case you crash out, and the imaginary rock and roll newspaper from San Francisco wants to get any pictures of you, you'll look like you washed your face. Really.
It's better this way with a clean face.
People think groupies are such dirty girls.
Heh . . . I wouldn't mind sort of fucking all three of them!
Look, over there!
What?
He's doing it, he's watching us from the fake bandstand with the binoculars!
Who, the English dude?
Oh, rivet-boy!
The rivet boy? Where?
Over there, wipe that stuff out of your eyes.
It looks like he's beating off.
Beating off? I knew he was a pervert.
Eww, how exciting. Hey, are you still trying to O.D.?
Yes, this definitely is the end for me!
I feel so faint! So weak!
Good evening honey, that was the most imaginary collapse I've seen since last week.
Janet, do you think she's going to die?
Are you kidding? Did you see her hit the floor?
God, well it was so obviously cheap. Lift up your head, honey.
I'm going to die. This time it's real.
Listen, Lucy, we gotta get ready for our big dance number, we're going to the fake nightclub tonight.
Everything's getting dim.
Why don't you tell her a story while you put your makeup on? Good evening.
Oh. Listen, toots. I'm going to make up a nice little fairy tale for you.
The pills, the Mandrax, I took so many of them.
I'll tell you part of the story, and then you make up another part that goes along with it. Once upon a time there was a tall, handsome, muscular . . .
Dwarf.
. . . with a very special . . .
Swedish apparatus!
. . . that him and his friends would use in c onjunction with . . .
Bold new surgical experiments!
. . . involving . . .
A bludgeon, and a bottle of champagne . . .
. . . and a . . .
. . . microwave oven . . .
. . . from a . . .
. . . jumbo jet, one of the big jobs leased from
Air Rangoon!
. . . which, when used correctly . . .
. . . can effectively increase the dimensions . . .
. . . and firepower of your . . .
. . . dick . . .
. . . to the point where . . .
. . . in some instances, it should be classified as a lethal weapon!
Your dick!
Your dick?
Your dork!
Your dork?
Your prick!
Your prick?
Your pork!
Your pork?
Your pork?
Who calls it a pork? These men, and the stuff they call a wee-wee!
A wee-wee?
You mean a penis, don't you?
A penis?
Penis is such an ugly word.
It's not that ugly, really.
Sure, I-I use it all the time.
Sure, sure, we all say it every once in a while. Listen:
PENIS.
Ewww!
Penis! Penis!
Ew, it sounds so revolting the way you guys say it. Ew, ka-ka.
Ka-ka!
The penis can be a very useful organ.
Yeah, and very exciting, too, once you get to know me.
Oh, yeah, right, yeah, etc . . .
Penis!
It sounds so overwhelmingly medicinal.
A penis sounds like something a doctor would have hanging off of him.
None of the men I know and love in the rock and roll business got penises. They all got cocks or dicks at least.
Sure, you want to go strap on a pop star, and he wants to stick a penis up you, where is that at?
Let's ask our studio audience!
Will you trade what he has in his pants for what I have behind this curtain?
What is it?
You mean what's in his pants?
I know what's in his pants, he's a lonely guy.
You have to choose before the big wheel stops whirling. You! Hey, buddy! Sky marshall! Go whirl the big wheel!
Can I just take the money?
There isn't any money, just the curtain and . . .
. . . the lonely guy.
Time is running out, think it over carefully.
The curtain!
I want the money.
Wait! What could it be in there?
In his pants?
In the curtain!
Doesn't anybody care what's in my pants?
Penis dimension
Penis dimension
Penis dimension is worrying me
I can't hardly sleep at night
'Cause of penis dimension
Do you worry?
Do you worry a lot?
No!
Do you worry?
Do you worry and moan . . .
That the size of your cock is not monstrous enough?
It's your penis dimension!
Penis dimension!
Wah ooo-wah ooo-wah ooo-wah
Wah ooo-wah ooo-wah ooo-wah
Hiya friends. Now just be honest about it. Did you ever consider the possiblity that your penis, and in the case of many dignified ladies, that the size of the titties themselves might provide elements of sub-conscious tension? Weird, twisted anxieties that could force a human being to have to become a politician!
A policeman!
A Jesuit monk
A rock and roll guitar player! A wino! You name it. Or in the case of the ladies, the ones that can't afford a silicone
BEEF-UP, they become writers of hot books
"Manuel, the gardener, placed his burning phallus in her quivering quim."
Yes, or they become Carmelite nuns!
"Gonzo, the lead guitar player, placed his mutated member in her slithering slit." Ha ha ha! Ooh . . .
Or race horse jockeys. There is no reason why you or your loved ones should suffer. Things are bad enough, without the size of your organ adding even more misery to the TROUBLES OF THE WORLD!
Right on, right on!
Now, if you're a lady and you've got munchkin tits, you can console yourself with this age-old line from primary school:
ANYTHING OVER A MOUTHFUL IS WASTED! YES!
And isn't it the truth? And if you're a guy, and one night you're at a party and you're trying to be cool, I mean, you aren't even wearing any underwear, you're being so cool, and somebody hits on you one night, and he looks you up and down and he says, uh . . .
Eight inches or less?
Well let me tell you, brothers, that's the time when you've got to turn around and look that sonofabitch right between the eyes, and you got to tell him these words:
I stuff three pair of socks and a bar of beauty soap down in front of my pants!

Out of the shower, she squeezes her spots;
Brushes her teeth;
Shoots a deodorant spray up her twat . . .
(It's getting her, getting her
Hot--Oh-woh-woh-woh-woh-woh)
She's just twenty-four
And she can't get off,
A sad but typical case, yeah
Last dude to do her
Got in and got soft;
She blew it,
And laughed in his face, yeah!
Face, yeah!
Yeah
She chooses all the clothes
She'll wear tonight to dance in!
The places that she goes
Are filled with guys from groups,
Waiting for a chance to break her pants in
PROVOCATIVE SQUATS!
PROVOCATIVE SQUATS!

Well, at least there's sort of a choice there;
Twenty or thirty at times there have been--
Somewhat desirable boys there--
Dressed really spiffy, with long hair--
Waiting for girls they can shove it right in

Hello there. All the guys in the band are pretending to get ready so they can go out and find some pussy.
Oh, I wonder where the action is in this town?
Every musician likes to find some pussy.
Boy, I coulda really scored last night. But every night its the same thing; Aynsley gets there first. He's so FAST . . . it must be from playing the drums or something. I mean . . . if those girls over there only knew my secret identity, but
. . . but how COULD they? How- how could they know that I am Bwana Dik?
Where's my hair dryer? Got to look lovely for the girls. After all, I am Bwana Dik.
Each guy has his own speciality for getting the girl of his dreams.
I sprayed my pits . . . I put on a new tie-dye t-shirt . . . I brushed my teeth . . .
I cleaned my glasses . . .
I buffed my nails.
I bought a copy of Down Beat so I could carry it around and look like I knew what was happening.
I left my shirt unbuttoned at the top . . .
I just KNOW I'm gonna get laid tonight. I'm not taking any chances. I got this little jar of tinsel glitter here . . . the same brand Danny Hutton puts on his face that makes him look all . . . glistening and seductive. Just put a little on here . . . the cheeks . . . the chin . . . mmm, the quivering lips . . . I'm so commercial I could die! Somebody . . .
TURN ON A BLUE SPOTLIGHT!!!
What will this morning bring me this evening?
Some local hot action
Before we are leaving (maybe we can get some head)
Go to the club or the bar or wherever the pussy is found
In the town your band is booked to play in
It's always a little bit harder to score
If it's just your first time in a town you never hit before
If you stayed in it once and got laid
You've got it made, ahhh, got it made
If it's just your first time
Then you know it's no fun to go
Back to a plastic hotel all alone
Go to the club or the bar
Go to the club or the bar
Go to the club or the bar
Or wherever the pussy is found
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
She's such a dignified lady
She's so pretty and soft
You can't call her a groupie
It just pisses her off
She got diamonds and jewelry
She got lotsa new clothes
She ain't hurtin' for money
So that everyone knows
That she knows what she wants
Knows what she likes
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Look out . . . she's got her eyes on you
She left her place after midnight
And she drove to the club
You know that her and her partner
Came here lookin' for love
They want a guy from a group
Got a thing in a charts
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER
They will give him their hearts
'Cause they know what they want
And they know what they like
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Look out . . . they got their eyes on you
FAM-BAM-YAK-A-TA-TAHHH!
They know what they want
Know what they like
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!
Daddy, daddy, daddy
Awright, you got 'em screamin' all night
Screamin' all night
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
It's a Bentley!
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
It's a Chevy!
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Or a Lincoln!
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
['Cause they're dancin'!]
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?
Ooo-ooo . . .
Oh wow, what a night. What's the matter, didn't you get any action tonight?
Didn't you used to be with the Mothers?
Yeah.
Is this what you do now?
I've got my own group, too. I don't mind being in this movie. I get a chance to transform a few times, drink these vile, foamy liquids.
Bleagh.
What kind of a life is that?
It's not that bad! Really! I LIKE to be a monster every once in awhile!
No one will ever take you seriously after this.
Why, because I transform? I LIKE to be a monster!
There's a little monster in every one of us.
You'll probably stay here for the rest of your life with your fake potions and your twisted monster face. You coulda
BEEN something in rock and roll.
I TRIED to get a hit single. It drove me to drink.
Ugh.
Hoo-hoo-ha-ha . . .
Go on, laugh about it. You could have been a star. You could have spread your aura across vast continental areas, your name on millions of small, hot lips, whispering under secure, pink blankets in the lonely midnight dark. But whaddya do? Ya join the Mothers, and ya end up working for Zappa, and he makes you be a creep! You coulda played the blues with John Mayall, or far-out exciting jazz with Blood Sweat and Tears.
You really think so?
Look. No one will ever take you seriously after this. How can they take you seriously? In this business you've either got to play the blues or sing with a high voice.
You're right. I never should have joined the Mothers. Why, I could be a star now! Oh, when I think of all those millions of . . .
Hey.
Hot pink juicy little . . .
Hey. Listen, do you know where I can uh, get any dope in this imaginary town?
Man, there's no dope in this town. Just these vile, foamy liquids.
Well, they're fake aren't they?
No, they're real! I mix them myself at home, and then I bring them in the morning . . . secret spiritual formulas . . .
Ew, what's a secret spiritual formula?
The stuff that goes in the elixir, the potion, whatever
I mix is irrelevant to the result.
You mean they're fake potions, right?
Look, it doesn't matter what's in the mix. It's the liquid! The concept . . . of the liquid . . . is enough to trigger a special cosmic state. Its because I'm so spiritually evolved . . .
Oh, listen, I just wanna get out of it, and go back to me fake motel room and play the blues, you know. Fuck your spiritual evolvement. Anyway, what happens if a new and exciting blues talent such as meself drinks your stuff?
Here. Take this back to your fake room.
Drink it.
I'd feel a lot happier if there was something I could smoke.
Well, here. Dip this in it. Now, let it dry out. That ought to get you a little HIGH. Or something.
Ew, I can't take you seriously.
Look, you might as well take this too.
I know its only fake potion. Well listen. We should get together sometime. Have a jam. Yeah, play some blues.
Extensions! Why not some extended blues licks?
White people can play the blues, you know.
Hello. Frank. Yeah, I gave it to him.
Yeah, he went back to the special room.
No, no. He's gonna smoke it. Yeah, right.
Hey, listen. You got any idea when we're gonna get paid for this?
What will I say
The next day to whatever
I drag to my hotel tonight?
What will I say
The next day to whatever
I drag to my hotel tonight?
What will this evening
Bring me this morning?
What will this evening
Bring me this morning?
A succulent fat one
A mod little flat one
Maybe a hot one (to give me the clap!)
Maybe a freak who gets off with a strap
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
If things go all right!
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
Will she be outasite?
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
If things go all right!
What will I say the next day to whatever I drag to my hotel tonight?
Will she be outasite?
Well listen. We should get together sometime. Have a jam. Yeah, play some blues. Extensions! Why not some extended blues licks? White people can play the blues, you know. Extensions! Why n . . . Extensions! Why n . . . Extensions! Why n . . . Extensions! Why not some extended blues licks? Why not some extended blues licks?
Yeah, I gave it to him. Yeah, he went back to the special room. No, no. He's gonna smoke it.
Jeff has gone out there on that stuff!
He should have never have used the elixir and only stuck to the incense. Oh, Atlantis . . .
That was BILLY THE MOUNTAIN, dressed up like Donovan, fading out on the wall-mounted TV screen. Jeff IS flipping out. Road fatigue! We've got to get him back to normal before Zappa finds out, and steals it, and makes him do it in the movie!
You have a brilliant career ahead of you, my boy,
Just GET OUT OF THIS GROUP!
Howard, that was Studebacher Hoch, dressed up like Jim Pons, giving career guidance to the bass player of a rock-oriented comedy group. Jeff's imagination has gone beyond the fringe of audience comprehension.
Jeff, Jeff, it's me, the Phlorescent Leech!
Jeff, Jeff, it's me, Eddie!
I'm stealing the towels! Ha ha . . . ha ha . . .
Stealing the room
Stealing the . . . Stealing the room
I'm  I'm
Stealing  Stealing
I'm  I'm  Stealing
This, as you might have gathered, is the end of the movie. The entire cast is assembled here at the Centerville
Recreational Facility to bid farewell to you, and to express thanks for your attendance at this theater.
This might seem old fashioned to some of you, but I'd like to join in on this song.
It's the kind of a sentimental song that you get at the end of a movie, , it's the kind of a song that people might sing to let you in the audience know that we really like you and care about you, yeah . . .
Understand how hard it is to laugh these days, with all the terrible problems in the world!
Lord, have mercy on the people in England
For the terrible food these people must eat
And may the Lord have mercy on the fate of this movie
And God bless the mind of the man in the street
Help all the rednecks and the flatfoot policemen
On the terrible functions they all must perform
God help the winos, the junkies, and the weirdos
And every poor soul who's adrift in the storm.
Help everybody, so they all get some action
Some love on the weekend, some real satisfaction
A room and a meal
And a garbage disposal
A lawn and a hose'll
Be strictly genteel
Lord, have mercy on the hippies and faggots
And the dykes and the weird little children they grow
Help the black man
Help the poor man
Help the milk man
Help the door man
Help the lonely, neglected old farts that I know
Well, it certainly has been swell . . .
If your name wasn't on the list of blessings we've been passing out tonight, we don't want you to be pissed off.
No . . .
We don't want you to leave that theater.
Forgive him, for he knows not what he does.
But before we go on, I'd like to introduce to you . . .
On the other hand, maybe he does know . . .
. . . my good friend and musical associate, Mr. Howard Kaylan who's about to give us a closing final benediction.
They're gonna clear out the studio
They're gonna tear down all the . . .
They're gonna whip down all the . . .
They're gonna sweep out all the . . .
They're gonna pay off all the . . .
And then . . .
And then . . .
And then . . .
And then . . .
Hey hey hey, everybody in the orchestra and the chorus
Talkin' 'bout every one of our lovely and talented dancers
Talkin' 'bout the light bulb men
Camera men
The make-up men
Yeah, the rake-up men
They're all gonna rise up
They're gonna jump up
I said jump up
Talkin' 'bout jump right up and off the floor
Jump right up and hit the door
They're all gonna rise up and jump off!
They're gonna ride on home
They're gonna ride on home
They're gonna ride on home
They're gonna ride on home
And once again
Take themselves
Seriously, yeeeah!
Two, three, four, seriously
They're all gonna go home (ye-hey!)
Through the driving sleet and rain
They're all gonna go home
Through the fog, through the dust
Through the tropical fever and the blistering frost
They're all gonna go home
And get out of it as they can be, baby
And the same goes for me
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
And each and every member of this rock oriented comedy group in his own special way
Is gonna get out of it as he can be
We all gonna get wasted
We all gonna get twisted
We all gonna get wasted
We all gonna get twisted
And I am definitely gonna get . . .
REAMED
'Cause I'm such a lonely
I'm such a lonely
A lonely, lonely, talkin' 'bout a lonely guy!
Oh, and I know tonight, I am definitely . . .
I am positively . . .
I just have to get . . .
BENT, REAMED AND WASTED
A disaster area the size of Atlantic City, New Jersey!
He's making me do this, ladies and gentlemen. I wouldn't do it if it weren't for him. You noticed, all through this material, I've been glancing over toward my left? Well, I'll tell you the reason for that, ladies and gentlemen. HE is over there. HE is over on the left. HE is the guy that is making me do all this shit. Right over there.
Now all through this movie, every time we've been on stage, I've had to look over in that direction, right?
You saw it . . . you know. Well that's 'cause HE's over there. I've got to watch him for signs.
He jumps up and down like a jackass. I can't even believe the guy sometimes.
But we gotta watch him. "After all," we said,
"it's Frank's movie."
Now, we're THE MOTHERS, but it's still Frank's movie.
Let's say it, he got to paid for it, he rented the studio, had all these cheesy sets built . . .
It's so moche! I can't even stand it . . .
He's telling everybody, right now, right over there, to . . .

My mind is clearer now
At last, all too well
I can see
Where we all soon will be
If you strip away
The myth from the man
You will see
Where we all soon will be
Jesus
You've started to believe the things they say of you
You really do believe this talk of God is true
And all the good you've done will soon get swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say
Listen, Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right-hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong
I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then
We called you a man
And believe me
My admiration for you hasn't died
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied
Nazareth, your famous son should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood he'd have made good
Tables, chairs and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm
Listen, Jesus
Do you care for your race
Don't you see we must keep in our place
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go
Too far
Listen, Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances
Weakening with every hour
Your followers are blind
Too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful but now it's sour
Yes, it's all
Gone sour
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Listen, Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
So come on, come on
He won't listen to me
Ah, Ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh
Come on, listen
Listen to me
Come on and listen to me
Ah, Ahh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Come on
Listen to me
Come on, listen
Listen to me
Ah-ah-ahh
Ohh, oh-oh-ohh
Come on
Listen to me
Listen to me

It seems to me a strange thing
Mystifying
That a man like you can waste his time
On women of her kind
Hey, cool it, man.
[ Chuckling ]
Yes, I can understand that
She amuses
But to let her kiss you and stroke your hair
That's hardly in your line
It's not that I object to her profession
But she doesn't fit in well with what you teach and say
It doesn't help us if you're inconsistent
They only need a small excuse
To put us all away
Who are you to criticize her
Who are you to despise her
Leave her, Leave her
Let her be now
Leave her, Leave her
She's with me now lf your slate is clean then you can throw stones lf your slate is not then leave her alone
- Hey, Jesus, what do we say ?
- [ Disciples Chattering ]
[ Chattering, lndistinct ]
I'm amazed that men like you
Can be so shallow thick and slow
There is not a man among you who knows or cares if I come or go
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong
How can you say that
How can you say that
How can you say that
How can you say that
Not one.
Not one of you !
We've been sitting on the fence for far too long
Why let him upset us
Caiaphas, let him be
All those imbeciles will see
He really doesn't matter
Jesus is important
We've let him go his way before
And while he starts a major war
We theorize and chatter
He's just another
Scripture-thumping hack from Galilee
The difference is they call him King
The difference frightens me
What about the Romans ?
When they see
King Jesus crowned
Do you think they'll stand around
Cheering and applauding
What about our people
If they see we've lost our nerve
Don't you think that they deserve
Something more rewarding
They've got what they want
They think so anyway
If he's what they want
Why take their toy away
He's a craze
Put yourself in my place
I can hardly step aside
Cannot let my hands be tied
I am law and order
What about our priesthood
Don't you see that we could fall
If we are to last at all
We cannot be divided
Then say so to the Council
But don't rely on subtlety
Frighten them or they won't see
Then we are decided
Then we are decided.
Try not to get worried
Try not to turn onto
Problems that upset you
Don't you know everything's all right
Yes, everything's fine
And we want you to sleep well tonight
Let the world turn without you tonight
If we try, we'll get by so forget all about us
- Tonight
- Everything's all right, yes
Everything's all right, yes
Sleep and I shall soothe you calm you and anoint you
- Myrrh for your hot forehead
- Ah
Then you'll feel everything's all right
Yes, everything's fine
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
And relax
Think of nothing
- Tonight
- Everything's all right, yes
- Everything's all right, yes
- Hey, hey, woman
Your fine ointment brand-new and expensive
Should have been saved for the poor
Why has it been wasted
We could have raised maybe
Three hundred silver pieces or more
People who are hungry
People who are starving
They matter more than your
Feet and hair
Try not to get worried
Try not to turn onto
- Problems that upset you
- Oh
- Don't you know everything's all right
- All right, yes
- Everything's all right, yes
- Surely you're not saying
We have the resources
To save the poor from their lot
There will be poor always pathetically struggling
Look at the good things you've got
Think while you still have me
Move while you still see me
You'll be lost and you'll be sorry
When I'm gone
[ Mary Magdalene ]
Sleep and I shall soothe you calm you and anoint you
- Myrrh for your hot forehead
- Oh
Then you'll feel everything's all right, yes
Everything's fine and it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Think of nothing tonight
- Tonight close your eyes and relax
- Think of nothing
- Close your eyes, Close your eyes
- And relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
Everything's all right, yes
Everything's all right
Good Caiaphas
The Council waits for you
The Pharisees
And priests are here for you
Ah, gentlemen
You know why we are here
We've not much time
And quite a problem here
[ Men ]
Hosanna, Superstar
Hosanna
Superstar
[ Women ]
Hosanna, Superstar
Hosanna
Superstar
Listen to that howling mob
Of blockheads in the street
A trick or two with lepers
And the whole town's on its feet
[ All ]
He is dangerous
Jesus Christ
Superstar
He is dangerous
Tell us that you're who they say you are
That man is in town right now to whip up some support
A rabble-rousing mission that I think we must abort
He is dangerous
Jesus Christ
Superstar
He is dangerous
[ Chattering ]
Look, Caiaphas
They're right outside our yard
Quick, Caiaphas
Go call the Roman guard
No, wait
We need a more permanent solution to our problem
What then to do about Jesus of Nazareth
Miracle wonderman hero of fools
No riots, no army no fighting, no slogans
One thing I'll say for him
Jesus is cool
We cannot leave him to his own devices
His half-witted fans will get out of control
- How can we stop him
- His glamour increases
- By leaps every minute
- He's top of the pole
I see bad things arising
The crowd crowned him king which the Romans would ban
I see blood and destruction
Our elimination because of one man
Blood and destruction because of one man
[ All ]
Because, because, because of one man
Our elimination because of one man
Because, because because of one
Cause of one cause of one man
[ Priest ] What then to do about this Jesus mania
[ Annas ] Oh, how do we deal with the carpenter-king
[ Priest ] Where do we start with a man who is bigger
Than John was when John did his baptism thing
Fools, you have no perception
The stakes we are gambling are frighteningly high
We must crush him completely
So like John before him this Jesus must die
For the sake of the nation this Jesus must die
[ All ] Must die, Must die
This Jesus must die
So like John before him this Jesus must die
Must die, Must die
This Jesus must, Jesus must
Jesus must die

Hey, J.C., J.C.
Won't you smile at me

Hey, superstar
Tell the rabble to be quiet
We anticipate a riot
This common crowd
Is much too loud
Tell the mob who sing your song
That they are fools and they are wrong
They are a curse
They should disperse
Hosanna, heysanna
Sanna, sanna, ho
Sanna, heysanna hosanna
Hey, J.C., J.C.
You're all right by me
Sanna, hosanna
Hey, superstar
Why waste your breath moaning at the crowd
Nothing can be done to stop the shouting
If every tongue were still
The noise would still continue
The rocks and stones themselves
Would start to sing
Hosanna, heysanna sanna, sanna, ho
Sanna, heysanna hosanna
Hey, J.C., J.C. won't you fight for me
Sanna, hosanna
Hey, superstar
Sing me your songs but not for me alone
Sing out for yourselves...
For you are blessed
There is not one of you who cannot win the Kingdom
The slow, the suffering
The quick, the dead
Hosanna, heysanna sanna, sanna, ho
Sanna, heysanna hosanna
Hey, J.C., J.C. would you die for me
Sanna, hosanna
Hey, superstar

And who've terrorized our people for so long

A... ha-ah-ah ah-ah-ah
...men
Neither you, Simon
Nor the 50,000
Nor the Romans nor the Jews
Nor Judas nor the twelve
Nor the priests nor the scribes
Nor doomed Jerusalem itself
Understand what power is
Understand what glory is
Understand at all
Understand at all
If you knew
All that I knew
My poor Jerusalem
You'd see the truth
But you'd close your eyes
But you'd close your eyes
While you live
Your troubles are many
Poor Jerusalem
To conquer death
You only have to die
You only have to die
I dreamed
I met a Galilean
A most amazing man
He had that look you very rarely find
The haunting, hunted kind
I asked him to say what had happened
How it all began
I asked again
He never said a word
As if he hadn't heard
And next the room was full
Of wild and angry men
They seemed to hate this man
They fell on him and then
Disappeared again
Then I saw thousands of millions
Crying for this man
And then I heard them mentioning my name
And leaving me the blame

Roll on up, Jerusalem
Come on in, Jerusalem
Sunday, here we go again
Live in me, Jerusalem
Here you live, Jerusalem
Here you breathe, Jerusalem
While your temple still survives you at least are still alive
I got things you won't believe
Name your pleasure, I will sell
I can fix your wildest needs
I got heaven, I got hell
Roll on up for my price is down
Come on in for the best in town
Take your pick of the finest wine
Lay your bets on this bird of mine
What you see is what you get
No one's been disappointed yet
Don't be scared
Give me a try
There is nothing you can't buy
Name your price, I got everything
Hurry, It's all going fast
Borrow cash on the finest terms
Hurry now while stocks still last

And forget all about us
Tonight
I don't know how to love him
What to do
How to move him
I've been changed
Yes, really changed ln these past few days when I've seen myself
I seem like someone else
I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me
He's a man
He's just a man
And I've had so many men before ln very many ways
He's just one more
Should I bring him down
Should I scream and shout
Should I speak of love
Let my feelings out
I never thought
I'd come to this
What's it all about
Don't ya think it's rather funny
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been
So calm, so cool
No lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so
I never thought
I'd come to this
What's it all about
Yet if he said he loved me
I'd be lost
I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope
Just couldn't cope
I'd turn my head
I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so
I want him so
I love him
So
[ Engines Roaring ]
Now if I help you it matters that you see
These sordid kind of things are coming hard to me
It's taken me some time to work out what to do
I weighed the whole thing out before I came to you
I have no thought at all about my own reward
I really didn't come here of my own accord
Just don't say I'm
Damned for all time
I came because I had to
I'm the one who saw
Jesus can't control it like he did before
Furthermore, I know that Jesus thinks so too
Jesus wouldn't mind that I was here with you
I have no thought at all about my own reward
I really didn't come here of my own accord
Just don't say I'm
Damned for all time
Annas, you're a friend a worldly man and wise
Caiaphas, my friend
I know you sympathize
Why are we the prophets
Why are we the ones
We see the sad solution
Know what must be done
I have no thought at all about my own reward
I really didn't come here of my own accord
Just don't say I'm
Damned
For all time
Cut the protesting
Forget the excuses
We want information
Get up off the floor
We have the papers we need to arrest him
You know his movements
We know the law
Your help in this matter won't go unrewarded
We'll pay you in silver cash on the nail
We just need to know where the soldiers can find him
- With no crowd 'round him
- Then we can't fail
I don't want your blood money
Oh, that doesn't matter
Our expenses are good
I don't need your blood money
But you might as well take it
We think that you should
Think of the things you can do with that money
Choose any charity
Give to the poor
We've noted your motives
We've noted your feelings
This isn't blood money
It's a--
- A fee.
- A fee, nothing more
On Thursday night
You'll find him where you want him
Far from the crowds ln the Garden
Of Gethsemane
[ Chorus ]
So long, Judas
So long, Judas
[ Jets Roaring ]
Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine
Don't disturb me now
I can see the answers
Till this evening is this morning
Life is fine
Always hoped that
I'd be an apostle
Knew that I would make it if I tried
Then when we retire
We can write the Gospels
So they'll still talk about us when we've died
The end ls just a little harder
When brought about
By friends
For all you care
This wine could be my blood
For all you care
This bread
Could be my body
The end.
This is my blood you drink
This is my body you eat lf you would, remember me
When you eat and drink
I must be mad thinking I'll be remembered
Yes, I must be out of my head
Look at your blank faces
My name will mean nothing
Ten minutes after I'm dead
One of you denies me
One of you betrays me
[ Apostles Shouting ]
No ! No !
[ Indistinct Shouting ]
Peter will deny me
- No, not me !
- ln just a few hours
Three times will deny me
And that's not all I see
One of you here dining
One of my 12 chosen
Will leave to betray me
Cut out the dramatics
You know very well who
- Why don't you go do it ?
- You want me to do it ?
- Hurry, they are waiting
- lf you knew why I do it
I don't care why you do it
To think I admired you
Well, now I despise you
- You liar, you Judas
- You wanted me to do it
What if I just stayed here and ruined your ambition
Christ, you deserve it
Hurry, you fool
Hurry and go
Save me your speeches
I don't want to know
Go, Go
Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine
What's that in the bread
It's gone to my head
Till this morning is this evening
Life is fine
Always hoped that
I'd be an apostle
Knew that I would make it if I tried
Then when we retire we can write the Gospels
So they'll all talk about us when we've died
You sad pathetic man
See where you brought us to
Our ideals die around us and all because of you
But the saddest cut of all
Someone had to turn you in
Like a common criminal
Like a wounded animal
A jaded mandarin
A jaded mandarin
Like a jaded, faded faded, jaded, jaded mandarin
Get out
They're waiting
Get out
They're waiting
Oh, they're waiting for you
Every time I look at you
I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand
You'd have managed better if you'd had it planned
A-a-a-ah
[ Bleating ]
Always hoped that
I'd be an apostle
Knew that I would make it if I tried lf I tried lf I tried
Then when we retire we can write the Gospels
So they'll still talk about us
When we've died
Will no one stay awake with me
Peter, John, James
Will none of you wait with me
Peter
John
James
I only want to say lf there is a way
Take this cup away from me
For I don't want to taste its poison
Feel it burn me
I have changed
I'm not as sure as when we started
Then, I was inspired
Now
I'm sad and tired
Listen
Surely I've exceeded expectations
Tried for three years
Seems like 30
Could You ask as much
From any other man
But if I die
See the saga through
And do the things
You ask of me
Let them hate me hit me, hurt me
Nail me to their tree
I'd want to know
I'd want to know, my God
I'd want to know
I'd want to know, my God
I'd want to see
I'd want to see, my God
I'd want to see
I'd want to see, my God
Why I
Should die
Would I be more noticed than I ever was before
Would the things
I've said and done
Matter any more
I'd have to know
I'd have to know, my Lord
I'd have to know
I'd have to know, my Lord
I'd have to see
I'd have to see, my Lord
I'd have to see
I'd have to see, my Lord lf I die what will be my reward lf I die what will be my reward
Have to know
I'd have to know, my Lord
Have to know
I'd have to know, my Lord
Why
Why should I die
Oh, why should I die
Can You show me now
That I would not be killed in vain
Show me just a little
Of Your omnipresent brain
Show me there's a reason for Your wanting me to die
You're far too keen on where and how
But not so hot on why
All right
I'll die
Oh, Oh
Just watch me die
See how
See how I'll die
Oh-h-h
Just watch me die
Then
I was inspired
Now
I'm sad and tired.
After all
I've tried for three years.
Seems like 90.
Why then am I scared to finish
What I started
What You started
I didn't start it.
God
Thy will is hard
But You hold every card
I will drink
Your cup of poison
Nail me to Your cross
And break me
Bleed me
Beat me, Kill me
Take me now
Before I change my mind
Judas, must you betray me...
With a kiss
What's the buzz
Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz
Tell me what's happenin'
What's happenin'
What's the buzz
Tell me what's a-happenin'
What's the buzz
Tell me what's a-happenin'
What's the buzz
Tell me what's a-happenin'

Tell me what's a-happenin'
Hang on, Lord
We're gonna fight for you
- Hang on, Lord
We're gonna fight for you
- Hang on, Lord
Hang on, Lord
We're gonna fight for you
- Hang on, Lord
We're gonna fight for you
- We're gonna fight for you
Put away your sword
Don't you know that it's all over
It was nice, but
Now it's gone
Why are you obsessed with fighting
Stick to fishing from now on
[ Indistinct Chatter ]
[ Man Laughing ]
Tell me, Christ how you feel tonight
Do you plan to put up a fight
Do you feel that you've had the breaks
What would you say were your big mistakes
Do you think that you may retire
Did you think you would get much higher
How do you view your coming trial
Have your men proved it's all worthwhile
Come with us to see Caiaphas
You'll just love the high priest's house
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die in the high priest's house
Come on, God
This is not like you
Let us know what you're gonna do
You know what your supporters feel
You'll escape in the final reel
Tell me, Christ how you feel tonight
Do you plan to put up a fight
Do you feel that you had the breaks
What would you say were your big mistakes
Come with us to see Caiaphas
You'll just love the high priest's house
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die in the high priest's house
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him now
We have got him now
Jesus, you must realize
The serious charges facing you
You say you're the Son of God in all your handouts
Well, is it true
That's what you say
You say that I am
There you have it, gentlemen
What more evidence do we need
Judas, thank you for the victim
Stay a while
You'll see it bleed
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Take him to Pilate
Take him to Pilate
Take him to Pilate
Take him to Pilate
I think I've seen you somewhere
I remember.
You were with that man they took away
I recognize your face
You've got the wrong man, lady
I don't know him
And I wasn't where he was tonight
Never near the place
That's strange for I am sure
I saw you with him
You were right by his side and yet you denied
I tell you
I was never, ever with him
But I saw you too.
He looked just like you.
I don't know him !
Peter, don't you know what you have said
You've gone and cut him dead
I had to do it
Don't you see
Or else they'd go for me
It's what he told us you would do
I wonder how he knew
[ Crowd Shouting ]
[ Shouting Continues ]
- Come on. Come on.
- There he is, see? Hurry. Come on.
Who is
This broken man
Cluttering up
My hallway
Who is this unfortunate
Someone Christ
King of the Jews
Oh. So this is
Jesus Christ.
I am really quite surprised
You look so small.
Not a king at all.
We all know that you are news
But are you King ?
King of the Jews
Your words, not mine.
What do
You mean by that
That is not an answer
You're deep ln trouble, friend
Someone Christ
King of the Jews
How can someone in your state
Be so cool about his fate
An amazing thing, this silent king.
Since you come from Galilee
Then you need not come to me
You're Herod's race.
[ Chuckles ]
You're Herod's case.
Hey, hosanna
Heysanna
Sanna sanna ho
Sanna, heysanna, ho and how
Hey, J.C., J.C.
Please explain to me
You had everything
Where is it now
Jesus, I am overjoyed...
To meet you face to face
You've been getting quite a name...
All around the place
Healing cripples
- Ooh.
- Raising from the dead
[ All Gasping ]
Now I understand you're God
[ Gasping ]
Hmm ? Huh ?
Mmm.
At least that's what you've said
So
You are the Christ
You're the great Jesus Christ
Prove to me that you're divine
Change my water into wine
That's all you need do
Then I'll know it's all true
Come on
King of the Jews
Jesus, you just won't believe the hit you've made around here
You are all we talk about
You're the wonder of the year
Oh, what a pity if it's all a lie
Still I'm sure that you can rock the cynics if you try
So if you are the Christ
Yes, the great Jesus Christ
Prove to me that you're no fool
Walk across my swimming pool
- lf you do that for me
- Whoo !
- Then I'll let you go free
- Whoo !
Come on
King of the Jews
I only ask what I'd ask any superstar
What is it that you have got that puts you where you are
Oh-ho-ho
I am waiting
Yes, I'm a captive fan
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man
So if you are the Christ
Yes, the great Jesus Christ
Feed my household with this bread
You can do it on your head
Uh, or has something gone wrong ?
Jesus, why do you take so long ?
Aw, come on,
King of the Jews !
Hey, aren't you
Scared of me, Christ
Mister wonderful Christ
Aaah !
You're a joke !
You're not the Lord.
You're nothing but a fraud.
Take him away
He's got nothing to say
Get out, you King of the--
Get out, King of the-- Oh !
Get out, you King of the Jews !
Get out of here !
You-- You--
Get out of here, you !
Get out of my life !
I've been living to see you
Dying to see you but it shouldn't be like this
This was unexpected
What do I do now
Could we start again please
I've been very hopeful so far
Now for the first time
I think we're going wrong
Hurry up and tell me
This is just a dream
Or could we start again please
I think you've made your point now
You've even gone a bit too far to get the message home
Before it gets too frightening
We ought to call a halt
So could we start again please
I've been living to see you
Dying to see you but it shouldn't be like this
This was unexpected
What do I do now
Could we start again please
Could we start again please
I think you've made your point now
You've even gone a bit too far to get the message home
Before it gets too frightening
We ought to call a halt
So could we start again please
Could we start again please
Could we start again please
Could we start again please
Could we start again please
Could we start again
Could we start again
My God
I saw him
He looked three-quarters dead and he was so bad I had to turn my head
You beat him so hard that he was bent and lame
And I know who everybody's gonna blame
I don't believe he knows
I acted for our good
I'd save him all this suffering if I could
Don't believe
Our good
And I'd save him if I could
Cut the confessions
Forget the excuses
I don't understand why you're filled with remorse
All that you've said has come true with a vengeance
The mob turned against him
You backed the right horse
What you have done will be the saving of everyone
You'll be remembered forever for this
And not only that
You've been paid for your efforts
Pretty good wages for one little kiss
Christ, I know you can't hear me
But I only did what you wanted me to
Christ, I'd sell out the nation
For I have been saddled with the murder of you
I have been spattered with innocent blood
I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud
I have been spattered with innocent blood
I shall be dragged through the slime and the slime and the
Slime and the mud
I
Don't know how to love him
I don't know why he moves me
He's a man
He's just a man
He is not a king
He's just the same
As anyone I know
He scares me so
When he's cold and dead
Will he let me be
Does he love
Does he love me too
Does he care for me
My mind is--
It's in darkness.
God. God, I'm sick !
I've been used !
And You knew all the time !
God-- God, I will never know why You chose me... for Your crime !
For Your bloody crime !
You have murdered me !
Mur-- Murdered me !
Murdered me ! Murdered me !
Murdered me ! Murdered me !
Murdered me ! Murdered-- !
So long, Judas
So long, Judas
So long, Judas
And so, the king is once again my guest
And why is this
Was Herod unimpressed
[ Caiaphas ]
We turn to Rome
To sentence Nazareth
We have no law
To put a man to death
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do
Talk to me, Jesus Christ
You have been brought here
Manacled, beaten, by your own people.
Do you have the first idea why you deserve it ?
Listen, King of the Jews
Where is your kingdom
Look at me
Am I a Jew
I have no kingdom.
In this world,
I'm through.
- Talk to me, Jesus Christ
- There may be a kingdom... for me somewhere.
If you only knew.
- Then you are a king.
- It's you that say I am
I look for truth and find that I get damned
And what is truth ls truth unchanging law
We both have truths
Are mine the same as yours
[ Crowd ]
Crucify him ! Crucify him !
What do you mean ?
You'd crucify your king ?
[ Crowd ]
We have no king but Caesar
He's done no wrong.
No, not the slightest thing.
We have no king but Caesar
Crucify him
Well, this is new.
Respect for Caesar !
Until now, this has been noticeably lacking.
Who is this Jesus ?
Why is he different ?
You Jews produce messiahs by the sackful.
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do
Talk to me
Jesus Christ
Look at your Jesus Christ
I'll agree he's mad
Ought to be locked up
But that is not a reason to destroy him
He's a sad little man not a king or god
Not a thief
I need a crime
[ Shouting ]
Crucify him ! Crucify him !
Crucify him !
Crucify him !
Behold the man
Behold your shattered king
We have no king but Caesar
You hypocrites
You hate us more than him
We have no king but Caesar
Crucify him
I see no reason
I find no evil
This man is harmless so why does he upset you
He's just misguided
Thinks he's important
But to keep you vultures happy,
I shall flog him !
Crucify him ! Crucify him !
Crucify him !
Crucify !
Crucify ! Crucify !
Crucify him ! Crucify him !
Crucify ! Crucify ! Crucify !

I don't believe you understand
You have nothing in your hands

Everything is fixed, and you can't change it.
You're a fool,

[ "Superstar" lnstrumental ]
Mmm, every time I look at you
I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand
You'd have managed better if you'd had it planned
Now why'd you choose such a backward time and such a strange land lf you'd come today you could have reached the whole nation lsrael in 4 B.C. had no mass communication

I commend... my spirit.
She's my kind of girl.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Really enjoyed it.
- Enjoyed your performance. It was so good.
- Thank you.
- How you doing?
- Fine, you?
- Is this your wife?
- Sure is.
- May I dance with her?
- Help yourself.
How long have you known Maury Dann?
I've been with the Dann just about eight months.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- How you doing?
- Fine. Fine.
- Good to see you. Hello.
- So proud to be here.
Thank you.
My name's Sandra Butterfield, but everybody calls me Sandy.
Anyway, Mr. Bridgeway, that's my boss, he said:
"In that case, Sandy, why don't we both not work and go to the show?"
- Wasn't that nice of him?
- Like my car?
My God, is that yours?
Oh, well, of course it is.
I'm sorry. I'm just being silly.
You know, I forgot to buy one of your records out front.
I didn't actually think I'd get to meet you to autograph the record.
I think I can fix that.
I got a couple of albums right here in the car.
Hey, bud.
I'm looking for a girl about yea tall, blond...
...pink and blue dress.
- About 24 years of age.
- Hell, man, so am I.
Very funny, Jack.
I ain't seen your girl, mister.
I don't think we took in over 600 at the door.
How'd the record sales go?
I counted over 400 people.
That means without the comps...
...we packed your place for you and then some.
Well, I guess it was a pretty good show.
Fucking-A, it was a pretty good show.
Where the hell have you been?
Honest to God, Mr. Bridgeway,
I've been in the girls' room.
I knocked on that goddamn door two or three times. Didn't you hear me?
No, I didn't. I didn't hear a sound.
I didn't hear anything.
Back in November, though, if you care to have us.
- At the same price?
- Sure, why not?
I don't know. I figured we should get a piece of the door money anyway.
I'll talk to Maury about that.
- How'd we do?
- Twelve-fifty.
Let's have it.
He wants a piece of the gate next time out.
People in hell want ice water too.
Okay.
Will you climb in, hon?
I asked him for a Dr Pepper, and he just stood there.
You get in the car.
Henry, hand me that amp there.
We'll get that amp.
- He's got a pair of kings.
- Pair of cowboys.
I got more than that too.
- Trey, pair of kings high.
- Put her in there. Put it in there.
- Pair of cowboys.
- Come on in, buddy.
- And a queen.
- Who's high?
- Ace high bet.
- What do you bet, buddy?
Bet a dollar.
- I'm gonna have to call you on that.
- Call one time.
- Call on a dollar.
- Did you want a chicken?
Yeah, good.
- He's got a pair of kings over here.
- All right.
- All right, who's high?
- I'll go.
All right. That's something to wash it down with. Now you're late.
We got you mustard on that hamburger there.
Like to see our tear gun.
- I say, pure shit. A cheap bet, ace.
- Two dollars.
Two dollars. Two dollars.
Two bucks. Two dollars.
Bob, ride? Bob rides, here we go.
Coming out.
Don't take too much money out of there.
All right, okay.
A nine. All right.
You got no help?
There's a pair. There you go.
No mayonnaise on this.
Freeze.
I'll raise it 10, boys.
- Ten. Ten dollars to ride.
- I'm gonna call you on that.
All right, don't shoot.
- Cards coming around.
- Cigarettes?
Leave them out there.
- You want to drag the money.
- You had a hell of a hand last time.
Here they come.
Down and dirty.
- You did?
- Yeah, I hit three.
- Did you really?
- I hit three.
A full house.
You the luckiest son of a bitch
I've ever seen in my life.
I'm gonna call you. That's it.
- I'll call you.
- I'm gonna have to fold.

Maury, can I see you a minute?
Anything you say, hoss.
- A quarter.
- How much, a quarter to me?
Quarter to you.
Shelley come up with that letter of agreement.
I thought you might wanna look at it before we send it out to the lawyer.
Let's look at the letter.
And remember that guy in Detroit?
One that says you hit him in the lobby of the hotel.
Tommy says he's filed suit, so when we get to Nashville...
...I want you to look out for process servers.
They'll probably hang around the King of the Road...
...or Music Row, or you can just take the summons and the hell with it.
Let's worry about that later.
The letter's okay. What else you got?
All right.
Now...
...you wanna hang around Nashville a couple of weeks...
...we can do the Opry the 15th...
...tape the Buck Owens' Show the 17th...
...and maybe the Johnny Cash special on the 26th.
What do you mean, "Maybe"?
The Country Cousins are booked. But I heard Molly Jackson's leaving the group.
Without her, there's no group.
So there's an opening, maybe.
Joyce said Johnny likes your payday.
This could be a big opportunity. It's worth hanging around a couple of weeks for.
We've been on the road three months now.
You need a rest.
I don't hang around Nashville waiting for Johnny Cash.
- I can remember...
- I didn't say anything about...
...waiting around for anybody.
We take a couple of weeks break. We do the Opry, we tape the Buck Owens' Show...
Goddamn it, man, there's money to be made on the road.
And Johnny Cash.
If you sock that in solid, we'll do it.
Otherwise, book us through the Northeast like we planned. It's over, hoss.
Goldarn, a whole barn full of country boys.
Hi, Jesse!
Oh, my God! You fuckers eating me alive.
Glad to make you a little loan, Bob.
McGinty, you Irish donkey bastard...
...that boy's got other things on his mind.
Don't he?
Oh, that's plenty clapping there.
Guess I'll say goodnight, boys.
Come on in.
What's this?
Well, this here is my bedroom.
I sleep here.
Well, I guess I'd better be getting on home now.
Well, you are home for the time being at least.
Hey. Don't do that. Be nice.
Well, I'll try to be nice, if you'll come on over here.
Hey, stop it.
What's your name, honey?
Don't ask me that.
I already told you my name.
Now be nice.
Now look, I'm gonna quit being nice if you don't stop telling me to be nice.
I asked you to be nice.
My name...
...is Rosamond.
I ain't gonna tell you my last name.
I think I wanna go home now.
Oh, you don't have to take me.
I'll go myself.
Bullshit.
What did you say to me?
I said, bullshit.
Hey, you can't talk to me that way.
Honest to God. Hey.
All I meant was you ain't going no place tonight.
You come here with me on purpose.
And this here is the purpose.
It's all over now.
Look. Come here, goddamn it.
Kick, hit.
- I'll see you.
- All right.
Operator, I wanna make a credit-card call.
I'd like to make a credit-card call.
...349W.
Nashville.
Yes, ma'am, I know the area code and number.
The phone number is 751-3907.
Fuck.
Hey, hey.
Wake up and piss. The wood's on fire.
What time is it?
I don't know.
It's early in the morning.
Time to court, lady.
I love you, sweet man.
Thank you, dear.
Come back to bed, Maury.
I want some more.
You always want more, don't you?
Well, sure I do. Don't you?
You might fool a clerk with that line, but you don't fool me. I'm fucked out.
That'll be the day when you're fucked out.
You're just tired of me.
Sure as hell tired of your bitching, that's for damn sure.
Come here.
I got a little present for you.
By God, you never quit, do you?
What's that?
God, I forgot.
I forgot.
What do you wanna do?
You wanna fiddle-fuck around, or are we gonna shoot some birds?
Mama?
Where are you, Mama?
You sick?
Well, I don't feel any too good.
That's a fact.
Where have you been?
Doesn't that woman come in here to clean up anymore?
I mean, this place is a mess.
I just don't have the strength no more, honey.
No get-up-and-get.
Well, get the woman in here.
She'll do it for you.
I told you that last time.
I hate to have somebody in here fussing.
Yeah, you hate to spend the money too, don't you?
You getting your money all right?
I'm just so down all the time, honey.
I don't have an ounce of strength most of the time.
Not an ounce.
Oh, hell.
This should hold you for a while.
You don't ever come to see your mama anymore:
Snapper, how's the puppy?
I don't think he's been fed or watered for some days, Maury.
Maybe we ought to feed him before we take him out there.
You want something to eat, Snapper?
He's a good boy. Here you go.
Goddamn it, Mama, you got nothing to do but to take care of Snapper...
...and the poor thing's out there surrounded by dog turds.
No food or water.
Where the hell's the dog food?
You got no call talking to me like that.
If you can't keep care of yourself or the dog...
...bring somebody around that can.
Send the bill to me, goddamn it.
Goddamn.
- Here we go. That's a boy.
- Come on in here.
Come here, dog. Come on. Come on here.
Come here, dog. Come on. Come on here.
- Come on.
- Come in here.
Let's go, Snap.
Let's go, dog, come on.
Let's go hunt on in here.
Come on along, dog. Come on.
Come along, Snapper. Come along.
- Careful now.
- Come on, now. Come on.
Here. Come on in.
Yeah.
- Come on.
- Come on over here.
Come on, then.
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Careful, now.
Cat foot.
- Come on, work here.
- Cat foot.
Tip, come here.
- Come on in.
- Careful, now.
Work here. Come on, Tip.
Over here.
Looks like they got birds up here.
Close here. Tip.
Careful. Careful here, now.
Careful, now. There's birds in there.
Cat foot.
Careful, now.
Close there. Close. Close.
Courage, now.
Careful.
Careful. Close, now.
Here we go.
- Come on.
- Here we go, now.
In the United States Navy, cash is a term bonus you can get...
...when you join the Navy.
You can enlist now and not report for 180 days.
- You're a pretty good shot.
- Thank you.
- I'll see you again next year, you hear?
- Okay.
Let's go, Snapper.
Come on, Snapper.
Get in the car. Come on.
Gotta go in now. Come on.
There you go.
Lloyd, old buddy, I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
- I enjoyed it.
- It was a good shoot.
You shoot quail as good as you pick that guitar.
Get out, get out.
Maury, I could take that dog to my brother's place...
...in Hopkins and meet y'all in Birmingham.
Hell, he'd be with two other dogs and run every day.
By the time you want him, he'd be right there.
Yeah, but he ain't your dog to worry about.
Yeah, but I tell you, the dog is just not getting the care he needs, Maury.
You know that.
Heck, your old ma, now, she means real well...
...but she's just not as young as she used to be.
Mama's 51 years old.
She was 16 when I was born.
So she can take care of this place all right.
Let loose of the dog.
Now, I'll tell you what, Maury.
Why don't you sell me the dog.
Goddamn, I never saw such a man for interfering in other folks' business.
Take your hands off my dog.
Nobody's gonna talk to me that way.
I guess I'll talk to you any way I feel like, buddy.
Now, wait just a minute.
I will buy that dog from you.
Now, you couldn't have paid more than 50 or $ 100, right?
Well, I'll give you $ 100 spot cash, right now.
And you know what, Maury? You always like to make a little extra on all your deals.
So here's $5 for yourself.
Oh, shit.
Get up, hoss!
That's all!
You're fired.
I done quit.
Take care, buddy.
Take care.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Take care.
The dog's yours if it means so goddamn much to you.
That's okay, Tommy,
I like them just the way they are.
Just the way they are.
Yeah, that's not good.
Yeah, hold on. Where's Bob Tally?
He went to take a shit, and the birds got him.
Hey, I'll call you back.
- Is that quit or fired?
- Little bit of both.
You're a big help. I'll put down fired.
Little flower.
Wake up.
It's you.
I mean...
Better get up.
We're gonna be pulling out of here soon.
Well, where's Bob?
Well, he's not with the band anymore, honey.
What's your name, honey?
Rosamond McClintock.
Where's Bob got to? His stuff's still here.
He knows where to find it.
By the time he gets here...
...we're gonna be long gone...
...and I thought that since you are interested...
...that you might wanna ride with us for a while...
...and see the show backstage in Birmingham.
Now, you could help out with a few things, do some chores.
Not afraid of a little work, are you?
We only pass this way once.
Might as well pass by in a Cadillac.
No, man, that's about a 4-pounder.
Mobile service operator.
I want YL7092 in the Nashville registry...
...operating in the Lyman area, the JP channel.
Yeah, this is car number two calling car number one. Yeah.
You gonna make that game?
No, no, all right, all right. Thank you.
See if we can pull up next to them.
Yeah, we're just having a little fun.
Throw me that pistol, hoss.
Yeah. Hold on, Leroy.
Do you think going 95 miles an hour is funny, sir?
Excuse me, sir. It is really all my fault...
...because I'm an entertainer, and I'm a bit late...
...for an engagement.
I told my people to step on it.
Why, you're Maury Dann.
- I'm very flattered you recognized me, sir.
- Recognize you?
- Why, you're one of my favorites.
- Thank you. Thank you.
I'm putting that down for 50 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Good to see you.
Glad to have met you, Maury.
Can I see you a minute?
Billy Lee Blackstone, I talked to him.
He's willing to work as a front man at 85 a night.
He'll meet us in Birmingham.
It's a good deal.
What happened to the band?
Well, the band fell to pieces.
The story I heard from Billy Lee was that they got a lead singer, Suzy...
...and she got the clap and gave it to the band.
And Billy took it home to his wife, and shit hit the fan.
I bet he'd like to get away from his home for a few days.
- Yeah.
- Tell you what.
Make the deal, and if he works out, we'll use him in Nashville on the recording date.
Well, that's something else because...
Hey, did he get rid of it?
- What?
- Never mind.
Honest to God.
I'm sorry, hon.
She got it all wet.
- Hey, man, you want a beer?
- Yeah, boy.
- Yeah, I'll take one, man.
- Thank you.
Hey, man. Here.
- That's a winner there.
- That'll calm your nerves.
Yeah.
Where you from, honey?
Well, I come from around Lyman there.
All my life.
All your life? You couldn't be a day over 17, now, could you?
I've got good skin.
Everybody says.
I'm a lot older than 17, though.
How old are you?
Rosamond. That's a pretty little name.
Who named you that, your mama or your daddy?
My daddy's not living with us.
My mama divorced him when I was just a little girl.
He lives in Bakersfield, California.
Yes. I've played Bakersfield, Modesto...
...Fresno, Stockton, Sacramento.
All those places.
Wouldn't your daddy be surprised if you was to show up in Bakersfield...
...with me and the band?
You got a job over there in Lyman?
What will they think when you don't show up for work?
I've been worried about that.
Mr. Parkinson at the dime store can be awful mean.
I work at the dime store.
Back of the hardware, culinary, pets counter.
Such a sweet little thing.
I just can't keep my eyes off you.
Or your hands either.
Honest, Mr. Maury.
Don't be afraid of me.
I'm not afraid of you.
That's good. I was hoping you wouldn't be afraid of me.
Such a sweet little thing.
11:35 country music time, and this is Bob Dickey...
...coming to you from WHHY in the heart of Dixie.
Maury.
Yeah, this is Bob Dickey's town.
Think we'd better stop and have a little chat with him?
Shit. Do I have to stop for every one-horse DJ in the entire South?
Okay. Okay.
Say, folks, if you don't happen to be doing anything else...
Hoss, do you know where WHHY is?
Right, boss.
We gotta stop there.
Right, boss.
I was gonna stop for gas anyhow.
Bob's been married twice, he's got a boy named Bob Jr...
...little girl, Sissy.
He's got a wife named Felicia.
Alicia. Alicia.
Alicia.
Listen, you bitch.
You'd better hop a bus back to Lyman...
...before the state police find out what's going on.
I'm of age.
Contrary to popular opinion.
Well, you may be 19 or 20, but you'll never see 21...
...if you don't stop bird-dogging other people's men.
You get the message?
I believe I do.
Do you?
Sure, he balled you.
He balls a lot of women.
He's a star, honey.
He gets the best things in life.
I don't blame him. If I were a man,
I'd ball you too.
God knows you're easy enough.
But don't mistake a little loving for something else.
Right now he's my man, and I mean to keep him as long as I want.
That might be sooner or later, but whatever it is...
...it won't have nothing to do with you.
Do you understand me?
I think we should let Maury decide.
Well, bless me, folks, guess who just walked into our studio.
It's our good friend Maury Dann.
Come on in, Maury.
Come on in here and sit down.
Don't tell me. Let me guess what brings you to our fair city.
You're on your way to Birmingham for the big Shower of Stars show...
...at the Civic Auditorium, am I right?
That's right, Bob. And I'm mighty glad to be able to see you.
I'm awful proud that you found the time...
...from your busy schedule to drop by and say hello.
Bob, any time I'm within 100 miles,
I'll drop in.
And how is Alicia and little Bob Jr. And Sissy?
Hey, they're just great.
You know, I got a whole house...
...full of Maury Dann fans...
...and I'm sure they'd want me to send their best regards.
- Thank you.
- Say, what's that you've got...
...tucked under your arm, Maury?
Looks like game birds of some sort.
It's some quail I shot over in Lyman this morning.
I just brought them over to you.
Listen, I can't tell you how much I appreciate that.
That fresh quail tastes mighty good.
I see you've brought along another copy of your latest album too.
Of course, we have a copy here at the radio station in play...
...but it's pretty near worn out.
And we're glad for a second copy.
- You gonna autograph those for us?
- Sure thing, Bob.
Hey, listen, right now we're gonna hear a selection...
...from Maury Dann's latest album.
It's one of my favorites and a favorite...
...of most of the folks throughout the Southland.
Maury, how the hell are you?
- Pretty good. How are you doing?
- Pretty good.
Say, listen, are you gonna be in this area next Monday night...
...or are you going on back to Nashville?
We're just getting off the road.
We got a few things to do. Why?
Well, I've got this thing I do once a month...
...local talent, you know, the bit at the local high school gymnasium...
...and, you know, just local pickers, that sort of thing...
...and every once in a while, some of the big stars drop by.
That's 400 miles.
Well, if you're too busy...
I can't promise, Bob.
Well, I knew I couldn't expect to get a promise out of Maury Dann...
...if he would be able to drop by and visit with us...
...on our Country Music Jamboree this coming Monday night...
...at the Davis High School auditorium.
I hate to boast, but I think the people of our community...
...are some of the finest folks in America.
That may sound kind of corny these days, but I truly believe it.
It doesn't sound corny to me, Bob.
I didn't think it would, Maury.
Listen, Bob, I gotta run.
I just dropped by to give you these birds and the records.
Tell you what,
I'm gonna autograph all of them...
...and you can hand them out at the jamboree. How's that?
Or you can give them away yourself if you can possibly make it, huh?
You're gonna get a hell of a lot of airplay here between now and then.
And none afterwards, huh?
You said it, I didn't.
Listen, man...
...I don't believe I can make it.
I know I've got those recording dates.
Yeah, I know. Well, I'll try to let the folks down easy.
You know, I like the way your career's been going, Maury.
You're gonna be a big star one of these days.
One of these days?
No, honestly, I appreciate that.
I know what an important part you played in my career.
Where the hell would the singers be without the DJ?
Where, indeed?
- Well, move over, goddamn it.
- Sit next to her? You get in the middle.
Jesus Christ. Women.
Turn the shit off. Haul ass.
Goddamn, pig fucker, son of a bitch.
Jesus. You're in a sweet temper.
- What happened in there?
- None of your business.
You're just like a little child, you know that?
Like a rich, little child with a lot of toys.
What's this?
Keep your hands off that!
Never mind her.
That's only a scrapbook of my publicity.
Stories about me in magazines and...
"Never mind her"?
I did all the work on that scrapbook!
- It's mine as much as it is yours!
- Stop this car now!
Get out!
You bet I'll get out!
You didn't earn it.
Where to, little lady?
I don't give a fuck!
Hey, hoss, you want a Coke?
We getting close to Galen's, ain't we?
Oh, hell.
Yeah, mobile operator.
I want YL7092.
No, it's my son's birthday.
No, no, no, goddamn it all.
Now listen to me.
I won't be but a few minutes.
You send the boys on to Birmingham.
That's right. And then... Well, you stick around. I wanna talk to you for a while.
That's right.
Hello, cowboy.
Hold the door open a little wider, will you?
Do you like to cook?
- What?
- Do you like to cook?
Well, a little bit.
I don't know too much about it.
Men make the best cooks.
So I've heard anyway.
All your chefs are men.
All your big chefs.
Well, I just never learned very much about it.
We just mostly eat in restaurants.
You know, Colonel Sanders and McDonald's.
I swear, I've ate 3000
McDonald hamburgers.
Doesn't your mother cook for you?
My mama cook?
Lord, she'd rather die.
Say...
...where are we?
Do you like omelets?
- Omelets?
- Sure.
Well, I never ate one.
I don't think.
Well, I make good omelets.
It's all in the timing.
That and your frying pan.
You look at that old devil, huh?
Well, it's black as your Uncle Dick's hatband.
You see the trick is you never wash the pan out.
I just take and wipe out all the trash with a wadded-up paper towel.
Though some say you'd be better off with cloth.
But I've never had no complaints.
Why, it's real nice.
Hey, have you ever used one of those...
...nonsticky things?
Nonsticky?
You mean coated pans?
You can't cook eggs on coated pans.
They get all brown and crusty.
Look, the trick to omelets is to cook them just till they're done, not one second more.
You can't get that kind of timing with a coated pan.
Might as well cook on an electric stove.
Well, we sure sell a lot of them...
...nonsticky things in the dime store.
- Hundreds and hundreds.
- Yeah, that's what I mean.
Most people don't know how to cook.
Say, what are you, some kind of chef or something?
I thought you were a driver.
Chief cook and bottle washer.
Don't you even know where the kids are after school?
Hell, Billy's only 6 or 7.
Billy is 11...
...Kitty's 13, and Elmore's 14.
I don't know who's birthday you thought you'd celebrate.
It's Elmore's birthday, that's who.
Well, you're either four months early or eight months late for that one.
Look at the things you bought.
What do you want me to do with them?
Do what the hell you want to do with them.
I don't give a damn.
Do you want a cup of coffee?
The kids will be home for supper by 6:00.
I can't hang around.
I think you have to now.
I can't tell them you were here, didn't even wait to see them.
I can't hang around.
Why don't you get them over here.
Call on the phone. You haven't got a thing to do but take care of them kids.
Don't you come in here off the road telling me how to raise children.
Don't you do it.
I'll lie to them.
I won't even tell them you were here.
That's just like you. That's a hell of a way to raise kids, lying to them.
What if the neighbors see the car out there?
Then you stay and wait for them.
I wish you'd never come by.
I got a right to see my kids any time I want to.
No, you don't.
You're not even their father any...
Maury...
...I know you're sorry.
I know it was an accident.
You came in all tense off of the road, look.
Bullshit, lady.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Good evening.
- Hi, table for four, please.
Maury Dann.
I don't care. I done quit.
- Evening, Miss Belder.
- Well, hello, Ted.
Goddamn!
I hear you quit us a bit ago.
I'm sorry, but I had to talk to Maury Dann.
- Who?
- Maury Dann. See him right over there?
Maury Dann.
Cowboy music.
He one of your heroes, boy?
Yes, sir.
Did I hear somebody say Maury Dann?
I said, did I hear somebody say
Maury Dann?
Yes, sir.
Sir.
Well, where is he?
Howdy, partner.
Maury Dann, huh?
That's right.
How you doing, hoss?
Pleased to meet you.
- I don't shake hands with you, mister.
- Hold it. Hold it.
You don't remember me, do you?
You're the fellow who was standing there a couple of minutes ago, right?
- How are you?
- That's it, make jokes.
You remember last night?
You remember a little girl named Sandy?
I'm sorry, I do not.
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I just want everybody to know that their big hero, Maury Dann...
...is nothing but a raper and a coward, that's all.
Yes, sir.
Ruined my girlfriend...
...and then hasn't got the guts to fight.
You damned sissy!
- Let me handle it, boss.
- Here I go.
Here I go.
- Boss.
- Okay, all right.
All right, great.
Let's go outside and talk away from these good people.
- Okay, shorty.
- All right.
- I'm the manager. What's the trouble?
- No trouble.
- We can handle it.
- I didn't come out here to argue.
I don't know you.
I don't know your girl...
...so why don't you hop on your horse and ride away. You get it?
You can't talk to me that way, you damn pimp.
You saw that.
The man pulled a knife on him.
Stay here. No, stay there.
We can't afford this.
I know it.
Well, you'll have to fix it.
Not this kind of a situation. The man's dead. His goddamn eyes are still open.
You'll have to fix things. I don't care how. Just get me out of this town tonight.
It's not this kind of a situation, Maury.
- We got cops, district attorneys, reporters.
- Buy them off.
We got shit you never heard of before, man:
Fix it.
Chicago.
Hey, hoss.
Come over here a minute, please.
Do you think you could stand still for this one? I sure would appreciate it.
Sure, Maury.
It should have been me anyway.
Thanks.
Well, he's dead, so there's no hurry.
We gotta call the police.
I'd appreciate it if you'd do that.
First, I wonder if you'd mind listening.
You saw the whole incident, didn't you?
Yeah, I guess so.
So you know that Maury Dann didn't have anything to do with it.
The whole blame for the incident lies with the dead man.
Sure, of course.
I can testify to that if you want me to.
What he's trying to say to you is that we can't stand still for this one.
I have... There's too many dates, too many people's jobs depend on me.
So I'm asking my associate...
Chicago, step over here, please.
- To stand in for me.
Do you understand that?
Exactly the way it happened, only Chicago here instead of Maury Dann.
Maury Dann wasn't a witness.
None of us were witnesses.
Just yourself and Chicago.
- Do you understand that?
- I don't know.
The publicity and...
Can I talk to you a minute?
Just for a minute.
Mr. Dann...
...I saw the whole thing too, and I'll be glad to tell it just like you said.
Who are you?
Well, my name's Ted Blankenship, and I work here.
Or I used to.
I guess I don't anymore.
But I don't care.
I'm really a songwriter and a singer.
And, well, I was wondering if...
If maybe you would listen to a couple of my songs.
We'll see.
There won't be any trouble, Mr. Dann.
Your man has explained to me the difficulty of your situation...
...and I fully agree that no positive result...
...could come from detaining you unnecessarily.
If you'll excuse me,
I'd better telephone the police.
How much?
Enough.
The kid's okay.
Don't worry about me.
Are there any other witnesses?
Yeah, there was some kid out here, and he saw what happened.
He can tell you it wasn't my fault.
The guy drew a knife on me, and I just hit him, that's all.
- And somehow he got stabbed.
- I see.
- Take an even strain, hoss.
- Okay, Maury.
I'll see you in Birmingham, huh?
Okay.
I got more. I got more.
I got one that's mostly for a girl singer.
- But I could...
- You want a job?
What's the goddamn hell the matter with you?
That poor man is dead.
I just can't believe it.
Well, you'd better believe it.
Poor man, my ass.
He come at me with a knife.
Say, when we get to the hotel...
Can you turn that down a minute?
When we get to the motel,
I want you to get a little rest...
...because we don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow.
I sure hope this weather lets up on us.
I'm serious. You've been on the go a long time now.
You need some rest.
I hope you don't think we bought anything back there.
Okay, mother hen. You did real good back there. Appreciate it.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Hey, come on. Something's the matter.
You're just a little tired, that's all.
Lord, after what you've been through today, it's no wonder.
Shut up and go take a shower.
I knew it.
- Do I smell bad or something?
- You smell fine.
It's that man who got himself killed.
Well, it's been on my mind too.
I hardly know what to think.
The only other time...
...that I ever saw a dead man...
...was on the street out in front of the dime store.
But he got all knocked to pieces by a car.
You could hardly see him, there was such a crowd.
Just emptied out of that dime store like a plague.
You never saw anything like it in your life.
Well, if you won't, I will.
Hey, boy.
Come on, wake up.
Hey, come on, let's get up now.
Come on.
Let's go. Time to go to work.
Why is it so blessed hot in here?
What time is it anyway?
Time to go to work.
Oh, God.
Here you go. Take this.
Let's go, boy. We got a long way to drive.
I thought you said we'd be a while.
Well...
Haul ass, boy!
Mr. Dann.
Mr. Dann.
Mr. Dann.
Mr. Dann.
What is it, hoss?
Well, I saw the police car and all.
I just wondered if there was gonna be any trouble.
If there's any trouble,
I'll sure let you know.
Well, I sure do hope there won't be any trouble.
Howdy, folks!
- Everything go okay?
- No trouble at all.
Guess you'd better introduce me to all these people.
You don't have to introduce me.
Officer Ratcliff.
- Ratliff.
- Ratliff.
- How are you, hoss?
- Just fine.
What brings you all the way here?
You a little bit off your beat, aren't you?
Well, when I got back to the barracks,
I naturally told everybody who I run into.
And, well, Ed Sanders here asked me if I'd introduce him to you.
- How are you?
- He's my brother-in-law.
I'm pleased to meet you.
You got a banjo in that case, wanna sing a couple of songs for me?
I hate to interrupt you, but we gotta get on with things.
Billy Lee Blackstone is ready to rehearse.
I see him. You mean I haven't got five minutes to listen to this man's songs?
Your time's kind of not your own.
We got a show tonight, everything.
This is Abe from the booking agency.
- How are you doing?
- We got a great show tonight.
Good deal.
How in goddamn hell are you?
How's the clap?
Shit. Busy morning, cowboy?
Yeah, busy enough.
- Who is this gentleman?
- This is...
Dabney, assistant district attorney for Grissom County.
I believe it was understood that you would remain in the county...
...to make a deposition in regard to the Bridgeway killing.
- McGinty?
- News to me.
What's going on around here anyway?
I don't understand anything.
And I think I wanna go home now.
But I don't have any money...
...and I'm afraid to ask Maury for any.
Well, you want me to ask him...?
Well, any way I can get it.
Well, why go home?
Well, how long have you been
Maury's girlfriend anyway?
It's just too complicated to explain.
I just think I wanna go home now.
This whole thing can be settled in a couple of hours.
My boss was a little hot...
...when he found out y'all had left the jurisdiction.
- And then when he talked to your man...
- Chicago!
Yeah, Chicago.
Well, he got rather confused, and then he got belligerent.
And then he stopped talking entirely.
And we just ain't too happy with the story we're getting.
Hey.
I'm sure all of this can be worked out to everybody's satisfaction.
This man's talking about taking you back to Grissom County.
- You'll miss the show, and we're sold out.
- Wait.
I didn't say he'd necessarily miss the show.
Necessarily? What is this necessarily bit?
I said, with a... That a case with this attendant publicity...
- Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
- Gentlemen, my ass.
All right, Maury, calm down.
Calm down, Maury.
Fuck it!
Get these people out of here, or I'm gonna start kicking ass.
You hear me?
I've got all I can take of this shit!
- I'm not public property!
- Maury, calm down.
Get these goddamn people out of here now.
I can't do it, Maury.
Not this time.
Okay. All right.
I'll go, then. Fuck y'all!
- You with me?
- Yes.
Let's go.
You ride in the back for a change.
Yeah, I see that.
Howdy. Nice day, ain't it?
Shit!
Would you by any chance be Maury Dann?
What can I do for you, hoss?
Are you for sure Maury Dann?
So they tell me.
Well, I've got a summons here to serve on you.
And no offense, Maury.
It's just part of my job, you know.
Better luck next time, hoss.
Reminds me of the country
I was raised in.
Flatter than hell, red dirt, little-bitty trees.
Where you from?
Gulfport, Mississippi.
Cotton country?
I was through there a couple of times.
Cotton's not far away.
Gulfport was hit by that big hurricane, you know?
Yeah, all them houses blown down.
Ever chop cotton?
No, sir.
I always tell folks I chopped cotton like I done it for 20 years.
Actually, I run off the farm when I was 12.
I went to St. Louis.
I hate farming.
How long you work in that restaurant?
Five months.
But I been doing that kind of work for a couple of years now.
But we had our own band back in Biloxi for a while.
You're on your way to Nashville.
- Huh?
- Yeah.
You'll get there pretty soon.
Mr. Maury...
...well, you never did tell me how you like my songs.
You'll do okay. Don't press it.
You can work for me till my man gets out of jail.
Then we'll do what we can for you.
- You play harmonica?
- Yes, sir!
Rummage around back there, see what you come up with.
Yes, sir.
Here we go. I got one.
Good. Play "Country Girl" for me.
Okay, go ahead.
My name is Sidney Westerfeld.
I'm the owner of this antique tavern...
...Monmouth Valley, New York State.
I was here when this crowd really came.
We expected fifty thousand a day, and there must have been a million!
I, myself, was hungry for two days, because I couldn't get any food in.
I couldn't get out to buy any food.
I was eating cornflakes for two days!
And the kids were wonderful.
I have no kicks.
It was "sir" this and "sir" that, and...
..."thank you" this and
"thank you" that.
Nobody can complain about the kids.
This thing was too big.
It was too big for the world!
Nobody has ever seen a thing like this!
And when they see this picture in the news, over the moving pictures...
...they'll really see something!
"It's been a long time coming..."
"...because it's been a long time gone..."
"...and it appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...time. It's a long, long, long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"Turn, turn any corner."
"Hear, hear, you must hear..."
"...what the people say."
"You know that something..."
"...is going on around here."
"But surely, surely, surely..."
"...one day I'm going to have my day."
"Oh, it appears to be a long, yes it does..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...ah-ha, such a long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"Speak out, you've got to speak out..."
"...against the madness."
"You've got to speak your mind, yes, today..."
"...but don't, no, don't, don't try to get yourself elected."
"If you do, you'll have to cut your hair..."
"...and it appears to be a long, yes, it does..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...time, such a long, long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"It's been a long time coming..."
"...it's going to be a long time gone..."
"...but you know..."
"...the darkest hour..."
"...the darkest phase, is always just before the dawn..."
"...and it appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long time..."
"...such a long, long, long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
Hey, Mike, what's the worst part of running one of these things?
The worst part?
What's the worst part of running one?
I don't know.
You dig it all?
I guess the biggest hassle is dealing with politics. You know.
Is there a lot of politics involved?
You mean with the cities?
And you got that solved?
Well, it looks that way.
How long did it take you to put it together. Two, three months?
Uh, been working on it for about nine months.
Nine months! Full time?
Are you in charge of the whole thing?
Yes.
But you got backers?
Partners and backers.
Where are you going to go from here?
I mean, are you going to do another one?
If it works.
Aw, you're really good tonight!
You know...
...this is the most outrageous spectacle
I've ever witnessed. Ever!
There's only one thing I wish.
I sure have to pee!
And there just is nowhere to go!
I believe we're "GOING UP THE
COUNTRY" a little bit right now.
"I'm going up the country, baby, don't you want to go?"
"I'm going up the country, baby, don't you want to go?"
"I'm going to someplace, where I've never been before."
"I'm going, I'm going, where the water tastes like wine."
"I'm going where the water tastes like wine."
"We can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time."
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."
"All this fussing and fighting, man, you know I sure can't stay."
"Now, baby, pack your leaving trunk.
You know we've got to leave today."
"Just exactly where we're going, I cannot say..."
"...but we might even leave the U.S.A."
"Because it's a brand new game and I want to play."
"No use in your running or screaming and crying..."
"...because you've got a home as long as I've got mine."
"If you smile at me,
I will understand..."
"...because that is something everybody, everywhere does in the same way."
"I can't see why you called a friend from the other side."
"There's just one thing
I've got to know..."
"...can you tell me who I am?"
"Say, can I have some of your purple berries?"
"Yes, I've been eating them six or seven weeks now."
"Haven't got sick once, probably keep us both alive."
"Wooden ships on the water..."
"...very free, easy, easy."
"You know, the way it's supposed to be."
"Silver people on the shoreline, let us be."
"Talking about very free and easy."
"All the ships that watch as you die..."
"...all they can do is echo your anguished cry."
"Still I go keep on feeling, why?"
"We are leaving. You don't need us."
What do you think?
Well, what could I think?
We're in the middle of the, of the situation and we make the best of it.
It's about all we can do.
We were standing on the curbs watching them come in, uh, last night.
All the townspeople.
It was just like a, an army invading a town. It's hard to believe.
Do you live here?
No, we're here for a vacation.
Are you having one?
We did, up until last night.
They kept us up for a while.
Who is they?
Freaks.
Is that what you call yourselves?
Sure.
Why?
Well, because that's what everybody else calls us.
What do you call yourself that for?
Because we admit it. Compared to everybody else, we're freaks.
I don't think you are. As long as you behave yourself, there's nothing wrong.
I'm not putting bad connotations on the word "freak", you know. I'm just...
Don't you think that the word "freak" itself has a bad connotation?
It's whatever you think about it.
Last time we saw anything like this was at the Rose Bowl Parade last New Year's.
That's right.
Like four ice cubes out of the bag, you know.
They wanted to buy four ice cubes?
Yeah, right.
I don't know, what can you charge them for ice cubes? You know.
It's a great shot in the arm to Sullivan
County, business-wise.
Something we needed.
As far as whether it will leave a favorable effect later, besides money...
...we'll know when the festival is over.
Uh, they're beautiful people.
Well is this festival affecting you in any way?
Well, it's kind of overwhelming us.
Put it this way.
In what way?
Just to take care of, to try to get the people fed,
I would say is one of the main objectives here.
I know all these young fellows here, they've got to be fed and they're going to get hungry.
I hope that they can bring enough supplies in for, for...
That seems to be the big trouble.
And traffic, that's... well, you know yourself without me telling you.
What's it done for business?
Oh, come on.
What's it done?
Increased it about what?
As much as you can do.
Put it this way. And more.
I'll say one thing for the young people.
They've been very nice.
All of them. So far.
It's really amazing. Yet it looks like some kind of Biblical, epochal...
...unbelievable scene!
They're all, you know, like all...
You see these cars, they're strewn on the sides of the roads from the helicopters and...
...in all different angles, you know. They look like jackstraws and stuff like that.
There is this continual flow of people just riding the stream.
They're going along and it...
Jerry, it was all frozen.
So let's enjoy. It was all I could get.
Well, I mean, I mean, from a practical point of view, what do you think, how could they limit this crowd?
They didn't want this many people here, really, I don't think.
So you find the control points at the beginning of the highways...
...and those with tickets are allowed in and those without tickets are not.
You have to have some control.
You know, when you have man-eating...
...Barabunda ants coming over a hill in South America...
...they want to cut them off and stop them from coming. They make a ditch...
...they put oil in the ditch and they make a flame.
Now I'm not saying they should put up flames to stop the people...
...but there has to be some way of stopping the influx of humanity.
Uh, in numbers, tell me, how many do you expect?
Two hundred thousand.
Two hundred thousand people here over the three days?
Where will you put them?
We have contracted for land surrounding the area...
...setting up camp grounds, water facilities, toilets, electric, food.
What does it cost to put one of these things together?
A fortune.
And I suppose the returns will also be good.
Yeah, we'll probably... I don't, I don't know what the returns will come up to...
...up to what it's cost or not, but...
...the point is that it's happening.
A couple of million dollars.
In other words, you have to make two million dollars to break even?
Well, if we're going to break even.
Huh, you know.
The point is that it's happened and it's working...
...and it's enough for now.
What is it that musicians have?
Are you a musician yourself?
What is it the musicians have that they can communicate so well to the kids?
Music!
I mean, they've always had music.
Music has always been a major form of communication.
Only now the lyrics and the type of music is a little bit...
...more involved in society than it was.
I need something now, let me tell you, to kind of run as a voice over... when I'm showing this music on...
If you could, if you could tell me...
...that I can run your voice over while this music is playing...
...what the music is saying, kind of, you know, what that's about.
It's about what's happening now...
...and if you listen to the lyrics and you listen to the, to the rhythm...
...and, and what's in the music...
...then you'll know what's, what's going on with the culture.
I've got to split.
Can we count on you?
Great, groovy. Thanks.
I'd like... Mike hangs out here.
I'd like to see a little bit of him.
Just natural sound, while he's getting harassed and bugged. Okay?
Now, goddamnit, I was going to call you last week!
That means you've got to call me and
I've got to get that thing into the air.
Now I'm going to order a five-passenger helicopter.
I'm really scared the roads are going to get jammed up.
If anybody wants anymore rooms...
...shows up with more people than they're supposed to have...
...tell them they can drop back fifteen yards and punt!
They've got about as much chance as a snow ball in hell...
...of getting a room closer than Middletown.
There's a Holiday Inn in
Middletown, New York.
Let's clear the road, please!
Peel back, peel back there!
Let them through.
Everything has room to flow here.
Please walk...
...on the grass.
Walk on the sides of the road if you're going to walk through here. Let's go.
How is it out there?
We apologize for the, uh, noise of the choppity-choppy, but...
...it seems there are a few cars blocking the road, so we're flying everybody in.
I almost made the worst pun in the world about high musicians, but we'll skip that.
You know Artie? Artie Kornfeld.
How you doing, man?
Good to see you, man.
Glad you could make the party.
It's going beautifully, man.
Wouldn't have it any other way.
It's really together.
Look at the way...
It really worked out nice, didn't it?
Looks fantastic!
The vibes are so beautiful.
Everybody helps everybody.
Today it feels so great right here, you know?
How can I ever live on the east side of Manhattan after this scene?
Yeah, man, it smells like strawberries!
It's perfume! Oh, it is!
"Just Like A Woman"...
...and "Let's Get Stoned."
We're in sync, but you can't hear a fucking thing...
...because of the fucking helicopters, so I'm going to quit!
Because of the fucking helicopters...
...I can't get a fucking piece of dialogue at all, man.
I'm hanging around blowing my brains out!
We're getting it tied up.
Two or three of the groups are in.
We're just trying to match up two groups and equipment and we'll be okay.
Can those of you in the back hear well?
Raise your hands please.
It's all right? Thank you.
Marijuana! Exhibit A.
Look at all those people!
The Daily News, in rather large headlines, still costing ten cents...
..."TRAFFIC UP TIGHT AT HIPPIE FEST."
See, if you see the, show the picture in India...
...they won't believe this is taken in America.
Because their impression of American children...
...and American ways is completely different.
All neatly dressed, put on hat and tie and sitting on chairs.
That's not like this at all.
Wheat Germ, Holly has your bag with your medicine.
Please meet at the information booth as soon as you can, please.
Helen Savage, please call your father at the Motel Glory in Woodridge.
The warning that I've received you might take it...
...with however many grains of salt you wish...
...that the brown acid that is circulating around is not specifically too good.
It is suggested that you stay away from that...
...but it's your own trip, so be my guest.
Please be advised there is a warning on the one, okay?
Sam, can you get the monitors on?
Get some more guys over here.
This is going to be the heavy side.
Richard Boch, get back to Eddie
Kramer in the sound truck.
- Watch your fingers right up there!
- Hold it.
Mr. Richie Havens!
"Hey, look-a yonder, tell me what's that you see..."
"...marching to the fields of concord?"
"Looks like Handsome Johnny, with his flintlock in his hand..."
"...marching to the Concord war."
"...hey, marching to the Concord war."
"Hey, look-a yonder, tell me what's that you see..."
"...marching to the fields of Dunkirk?"
"Looks like Handsome Johnny with a carbine in his hand..."
"...marching to the Dunkirk war."
"Hey, marching to the Dunkirk war."
"Hey, look-a yonder, tell me what's that you see..."
"...marching to the fields of Korea?"
"Looks like Handsome Johnny with his M-1 in his hand..."
"...marching to the Korean war."
"Hey, marching to the Korean war."
"Still marching, still marching, still marching."
"It's a long, hard road..."
"...that he fought so we'll be free."
"That he fought, we'll be free.
Yeah, free!"
"Hey, look-a yonder, tell me what's that you see..."
"...marching to the fields of Birmingham?"
"Looks like Handsome Johnny with his hand rolled in a fist..."
"...marching to the Birmingham war."
"Hey, marching to the Birmingham war."
"Hey, what's the use of singing this song?"
"Some of you are not even listening."
"Tell me what it is we've got to do?"
"Wait for the bombs to start whistling?"
"Wait for the blitz to start blitzing?"
"Here comes a hydrogen bomb..."
"...and here comes a guided missile."
"Here comes a hydrogen bomb..."
"...I cannot hear it whistle!"
"I can almost hear its whistle, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
There are a hundred million songs going to be sung tonight.
All of them are going to be singing about the same thing...
...which I hope everybody who came, came to hear, really.
And it's all about you, actually.
And me and everybody around this stage and everybody that hasn't gotten here.
And the people who are going to read about you tomorrow.
And how really groovy you were.
All over the world.
If you can dig where that's at.
That's really where it's really at.
Guitar mike, please.
"Freedom! Freedom!"
"Sometimes I feel like a motherless child..."
"...a long way from home."
"Yeah, yeah, Lord..."
"...singing freedom! Freedom!"
"Sometimes I feel like
I'm almost gone..."
"...a long, long, long way, way from home."
"Clap your hands!"
"I've got a telephone in my bosom..."
"...and I can call him up from my heart."
"I've got a telephone in my bosom..."
"...and I can call him up from my heart..."
"...when I need my brother!"
"When I need my father! "
"Mother!"
"Sister!"
"When I need my brother!"
"Brother! Hey! Mother! "
"Mr. Richie Havens."
What better way to start than with the beautiful "Richie Havens."
It's worth it.
Just to see the lights go on last night, man!
Just to see the people stand up, man, it makes it worth it.
I mean, I feel there will be people, you know...
...there are people out there that really don't dig it.
Very few of them.
But you know, it really is to the point where it's just a family, man.
All box office people please go to the main box office.
We don't need it any more.
Somebody unplugged the lines, man.
Let's have a hot mike.
Number two, number three.
You are not giving the world's greatest three day freebee!
Okay, there's only one way to do it.
There's a way to do it, man.
There is no way.
The only way to do it is to get into a rap with...
It's okay. Come here. Come here.
This is one thing I was going to wait a while before we talked about it.
But maybe we'll talk about it now so you can think about it.
It's a free concert from now on!
That doesn't mean that anything goes.
What that means is...
...we're going to put the music up here for free.
What it means is that the people who are backing this thing...
...who put up the money for it, are going to take a bit of a bath.
A big bath. There's no hype, that's true. They're going to get hurt.
But what it means is that these people have it in their heads...
...that your welfare is a hell of a lot more important...
...and so is the music, than a dollar.
Look, when they hook the electricity up, a great jolt runs all the way through here.
If you've got the ticket, you disconnect the circuit and...
...otherwise you disintegrate.
Wendy and Mayar... , Maynard...
...from Fair Lawn, please meet
Jill in front of the stage.
George has a slight problem.
He broke his arm.
Oh, it's on Forty-second Street. Tiny Tim used to sing there. Did you know that?
Under the name of Robert, uh, Love.
Larry Love!
Could I get the picture, too?
Oh, yes. Toot too, too, too.
Tell me, little girl, what's your name?
My name is Beth Riley, and what's yours?
My name is Hugh.
How do you do? My name is Sue.
I'll see you around.
Ah, here they come, here they come.
My name is Hugh Romney. I'm with the
Hog Farm. And I'm working on a scene.
Some people call it bum trips. I don't think there is such a thing as a bum trip.
We're working with hobo voyages.
A half an hour after we release anybody from our section...
...we turn them into doctors...
...and they care for people that were tripping like they were when they came in.
Now people have been saying that some of this acid is poison.
It's not poison, it's just bad acid.
It's manufactured poorly.
If you can find out who it is, we...
Anybody who thinks they've taken some poison, forget it.
And if you feel like experimenting, only take half a tab. Okay? Thank you.
You know, the Japanese made that motorcycle.
The Japanese affected that thing over there...
...with the yellow robes, or the Indian.
Really does a lot for the music that motorcycle.
Who's on?
A guy named Bert Sommers.
I think Timmy Hardin is going on next.
So the order of everything just went kaplooey?
You're closing tonight, honey.
Maybe there'll be a few more people here by then.
I don't like a puny gathering like this.
I'd like to sing you a song that is one of my husband, David's, favorite songs.
And let me just tell you that he is fine. And...
...and we're fine too.
And David was just shifted from the county jail...
...which is very much of a drag, to Federal prison...
...which is kind of like a big summer camp...
...after you've been in county jail long enough.
See I just, just now got a letter.
I have it with me. About the trip from the county jail. Manacles on his legs...
...and his arms manacled to his belt.
Well, I mean, it's all worth writing about.
He doesn't care, you know.
And there's only one time that...
...where the first time he felt afraid in the whole thing, was a couple of...
...I guess guards, or something, they started talking very loud.
And he started saying...
...talking about the last draft case that they had been through...
...and "that motherfucker," and "we'll get you, motherfucker," you know?
He just prayed a little bit harder.
He wouldn't do anything anyhow, but it's not a very comfortable feeling.
But nothing has happened.
Anyway, this is, this is an organizing song.
And I'm, I was happy to find out that...
...after David had been in jail for two and a half weeks...
...he already had a very, very good hunger strike...
...going on with forty-two federal prisoners...
...none of whom were draft people.
"I dreamed I saw Joe
Hill last night..."
"...alive as you and me."
"Sez I, 'But Joe, you're ten years dead!"'
"'I never died, ' said he."
"'The copper bosses killed you, Joe!"'
"'They shot you, Joe, ' says I."
"'Takes more than guns to kill a man'..."
"Says Joe, 'I didn't die!"'
"And standing there as big as life..."
"...and smiling with his eyes."
"Says Joe, 'What they can never kill,"
"...went on to organize."'
"From San Diego up to Maine..."
"...in every mine and mill..."
"...where working men defend their rights..."
"...it's there you find Joe Hill!"
"Swing low..."
"...sweet chariot..."
"...coming to carry me home."
"Swing low..."
"...sweet chariot..."
"...coming for to carry me on home."
"Well, I looked over yonder..."
"...and what did I see..."
"...coming to carry me home?"
"Saw a band, a band of angels..."
"...were a-coming for me..."
"...coming for to carry me on home."
"Swing low..."
"...swing low, sweet chariot..."
"...coming for to carry me on home. Home!"
"See me,"
"feel me,"
"touch me,"
"heal me."
"Listening to you, I get music."
"Gazing at you, I get heat."
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."
"I get excitement at your feet."
"Right behind you, I see the millions."
"On you, I see the glory."
"From you, I get opinions."
"From you, I get the story."
"Listening to you, I get music."
"Gazing at you, I get the heat."
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."
"I get excitement at your feet."
"From behind you, I see the millions."
"On you, I see the glory."
"From you, I get opinions."
"From you, I get the story."
"Now, I'm a-gonna raise a fuss.
Now, I'm going to raise a holler..."
"...about a-working all summer, just to try and earn a dollar."
"Well, I went to the boss, said, 'I've got a date."'
"The boss said, 'No dice, son.
You've got to work-a late."'
"Sometimes, I wonder what I'm going to do."
"There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."
"Well, my mom and poppa told me,
'Son, you've got to earn some money..."'
"'... if you want to use the car to go riding next Sunday."'
"Well, I didn't go to work.
I told the boss I was sick."
"Says they, 'You can't use the car, because you didn't work a lick."'
"Sometimes I wonder what
I'm a-gonna do."
"There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."
"I'm going to take two weeks, going to have a fine vacation."
"Going to take my problems to the United Nations."
"Well, I went to my Congressman.
He said..."
"'... l'd like to help you, son, but you're too young to vote."'
"Sometimes I wonder what I'm going to do."
"There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."
Ladies and gentlemen...
...The Who!
The word I get is that...
...maybe the best thing for everybody to do...
...unless you have a tent or some place specific to go to...
...just carve yourself out a piece of territory...
...say goodnight to your neighbor...
...and say thank you to yourself for making this the most peaceful...
...most pleasant day anybody has ever had in this kind of music.
Well, music is a thing that...
Well, you're obviously not here for the girls.
Oh, that's good, that's a basic thing, you know, like...
...there are a lot of girls here and they're probably...
...a lot freer than, you know, other places.
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of balling.
Well, you bring your own coals to Newcastle?
Are you two going together or are you just hitching together?
We've lived together for about four months, or five months.
You know, with a lot of other people.
Kind of what you'd call...
...a communal thing, or someone else would call a communal thing.
But it's just, we just live together...
...and so we just decided to come down together because we were coming here.
And like there's nothing, I mean, no definite thing about...
We're not necessarily going to be together throughout the whole thing.
So you're not particularly jealous of him?
Are you two going together?
But you two came up here together.
You like that?
Yeah, I like her.
I love her. I enjoy her.
What do you think about all this?
Well, the way I look at it...
...like I've known Jerry for what?
Four or five, six months now.
When he moved into the family group...
...that I was alr... that I already knew for quite a while...
...in that time, I got to know him real well and I learned to love him.
Like, you know, we ball and everything, but...
...it's really a pretty good thing because
I have plenty, there's plenty of freedom.
Because if we're not going together and we're not in love or anything like that...
Can you communicate with your parents?
I can communicate with them on, on one level.
Now that I've been away from home for two years.
But at first it was very rough.
Now...
...they, you know, they're beginning to mellow about it.
It's not so hard on them I'm the way I am.
But I can't really communicate to them...
...about anything that's really important because they just could not understand it.
My mother is really, she really...
...lives in a lot of pain...
...because she's sure I'm going to go to hell and there's nothing I can do...
...to tell her that there is, that it just does not exist for me.
So I, there's no communication on, on those levels.
My father was asking whether I was in a communist training camp or something...
...in, in the house that I lived in.
I could understand, you know, where he came from. Because when he...
...well, he's an immigrant, you know.
And so he came over here to better himself...
...economically and so forth, and all that other rot.
And, to make it better for me and he can't understand why I didn't play, you know...
...saying, "Why aren't you playing the game?"
"Here's all this opportunity.
Here's, here are all these things...
...which have so much value."
But they only have value to him...
...and he can't understand why they don't have value to me.
But he does have wisdom enough to know, to allow me to be who I am.
I guess he had some kind of idea in his head that...
...I will, by doing what I'm doing, learn for myself how to live.
And that's what he wants me to do, anyway.
So he, he can't understand why I am the way I am...
...but he, he very much wants me to be that way.
Because he knows that's the only thing for me.
He started his trip when he was four years old.
Really?
Nothing to do with drugs or anything?
Me, neither.
Do you think that's a cop-out or...?
I, I don't know. I, I used to be into drugs and...
...I was very heavy on drugs, but...
...now it seems like it's almost contrived.
It's like drugs and revolution and the united front and all.
You know, I'm a human being and that's all I want to be. And I don't...
...I don't want to have a mass change...
...because a mass change only brings around mass insanity.
I just want to be myself and find out, find a place where I can...
...maintain some kind of balance within myself, you know.
I'm kind of like the Hamlet trip, you know. To be or not to be.
Do you think you could ever communicate with a guy like Nixon or Westmoreland?
I hope so.
They're doing their thing, aren't they?
I don't know. It's like they, they're neurotic or psychotic or...
...having fun as they say in
Life Mag... I don't know.
They could say the same thing of you.
Yeah, right. But it's not true, because,
I, I don't need all that power, you know.
Where I can just, I can just sit here right on this roadside...
...and I, I don't have to become
President of the United States.
And I don't have to go all that way up.
I don't have to make the climb.
Because there's nothing to climb for.
It's all sitting right here.
Do you have tickets to this thing?
No.
How are you going to get in?
I don't really know.
I figured, you know, once I got here...
...l'd see whatever happens and go along with it.
It's like people that are nowhere are coming here...
...because there are people they think are somewhere...
...so everybody is really looking for, you know, for some kind of answer.
Where there isn't one.
Why would three hundred thousand...
...or a hundred and twenty thousand sixty thousand...
...seventy thousand people come to anything just because it's music?
I mean, was music all that important?
I don't really think so.
People don't know, they don't know how to live and they don't know what to do...
...and they think that if they...
...can come here they can find out.
You know, what it is...
...or how to maintain with it.
It's just like people are very lost, I think.
America leads the whole world in several ways.
Very recently, when
I was in the East...
...the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi...
...met me and asked me...
...what's happening in America?
And I said,
"America is becoming a whole."
"America is helping everybody..."
"...in the material field..."
"...but the time has come for
America to help the whole world..."
"...with spirituality, also."
"At the hop..."
"...we can rock to and fro and never let go, at the hop, hop, hop."
"When the records are playing, people eat a lot of chicken..."
"...at the hop, hop, hop."
"If you've got a little chicken, share it with your baby, at the hop, hop, hop."
"Oh, baby, hop! Let's go to the hop.
Oh, baby, let's go to the hop."
"Oh, baby, let's go to the hop!
Oh, baby, let's go to the Hop!"
"Well, let us go now. Let's go to the hop. Let's go to the hop, oh, baby!"
"Let's go to the hop, oh, baby.
Let's go to the hop."
"Go, go, let's go to the hop!
Let's go, go!"
"We will go rocking and rolling and stomping at the hop!"
"When the records are playing and the women start a-singing at the hop!"
"Oh, let's go now.
Let's go to the hop! "
"Let's go to the hop, oh baby.
Let's got to the hop, oh baby."
"Come on, let's go to the hop.
Hop!"
Ladies and gentlemen, the Sha-Na-Na!
Harold, turn up the mike.
Now, very slowly, start coming back up.
Lower the lock and pull yourself back up.
And then keep breathing as fast as you can.
Then exhale.
And relax. Then just feel the energy.
These, these are all beginning exercises of Kundalini Yoga.
Yoga means union.
It's the same energy force that drugs give you with a rush.
Right? It's, it's the same channels...
...only drugs do it for you and this way you can do it yourself.
You can do it when you want to...
...and you don't have to score to be able to do it.
All you've got to score is some clean air.
I learned it in Los Angeles.
And there was only a couple of months of clean air when I was learning it.
That's hard, too, these days.
But while there's still some clean air left, it would be groovy to...
...experiment with it like those guys who have been experimenting for...
...at least six thousand years and getting very high behind it.
The Kundalini nerve, it's called the nerve of awareness.
You can't dissect it. It's a current that runs up the center of your spine.
I don't know if any of you have ever sat down...
...and crossed your legs and smoked
DMT and watched what happens.
But what happens to me is this big thing...
...goes "uuurrrah" up my spine!
And flashes in my brain!
Well apparently, that's what is going to happen if I do this stuff and learn it.
It takes years, I guess, but this is the beginning of it.
These exercises are exercises to create...
...those channels in your body and to free your body of blocks.
The major block is your solar plexus.
That's why we're doing a lot of breath of fire.
It loosens the solar plexus.
And there are blocks in your spine and...
...back and wherever you've got blocks, to keep that energy from flowing.
Go within yourself and meditate on each breath.
Make each breath a complete breath.
And if you do it right, you'll be flashing momentarily.
Just keep up, concentrate on your breathing and hold that position.
Roll your toes forward so they point forward.
We're going to leave you with the usual thing.
Only thing I can say, as I said to so many people, this title, just about...
...puts it all into focus. It's called
"With A Little Help From My Friends."
Remember it.
"What would you do if
I sang out of tune..."
"...would you stand up and walk out on me?"
"Lend me your ears and
I'll sing you a song."
"I will try not to sing out of tune, yes."
"Oh, I'll get by..."
"...with a little help from my friends."
"Well, I never come up alive."
"Hey, there are so many ways."
"Well, I'm going back there for my friends."
"What do I do when my love is away?"
"Does it worry you to be alone?"
"Ho, no, no."
"How do I feel at the end of the day?"
"Are you sad because you're on your own?"
"I'll tell, never say it any more."
"Going to get a little help from my friends."
"I've got to buy favors for them."
"Don't bother about the love I gave."
"Help me find my way."
"Do you need anybody?"
"Oh, I need someone to love."
"Could it be anybody?"
"Oh, I need somebody..."
"...to dream about. I know her."
"Oh, I love her."
"Well, I'm going there,
I'm going there."
"Then I'm going to say that I'll know my way."
"Don't you know I care for my friends?"
"Would you believe in a love at first sight?"
"I'm sure that it happens all the time."
"You know it does."
"What do you see when you turn out the light?"
"I don't see nothing."
"I told you I get a lift, I've got to have a lift from my friends."
"Nobody cares the way I feel now."
"Oh, I sat there all alone."
"Do you need anybody?"
"Oh, Lord, I don't need anybody."
"Could it be that you're lonely?"
"Oh, Lord, I love her. I'll stand by."
"Going to dream about her, I know I am."
"Somebody said, 'Oh, I love her'."
"I've got to get my friends, I've got to get my friends to go..."
"Don't you know I said, there before your eyes...?"
"...l've got to get my friends together."
"All I've got to do is that now."
"I'm going to take them home with me now."
"You've got to get all your friends now."
"...you've got to get all your friends now."
"Nobody goes away..."
"...nobody goes away, yeah."
"You've got your friends, you've got your friends..."
"...you've got your friends, yeah."
"With a little help from my friends."
"Got to have love from my friends."
The Grease Band and myself thank you all very much, indeed.
See you again! Beautiful!
It looks like we're going to get a little bit of rain, so you better cover up.
If it does and if we should have any slight power problems...
...just cool it out. We'll sit here with you. It will be okay.
All right, everybody, just sit down, wrap yourself up.
We're going to have to ride it out.
Hold on to your neighbor, man.
Please get off those towers!
We don't need any extra weight on them!
Please move away from the towers.
The lamps might give us a problem.
Everybody who is in the back, please move back.
We have to get away from these towers.
Please move away from the towers!
Put the mike stands down on the floor.
Cover all the equipment.
Let's keep it nice and cool.
We'll be back with Country Joe in just a second as soon as we get set up.
Okay, so come on down off the towers.
Hey, if you think really hard, maybe we can stop this rain! Yeah.
Please move away from the towers.
Jody, get off the stage.
The wind is blowing this way.
Please be on this side of the towers.
Everyone in the back, please move back.
Just take it calm and easy.
I see it. Please move away from the towers.
I think the wind has run through it.
It is okay?
Give us some room. Go slowly, but move back. It will be cool.
Just move away from those towers!
We don't want one of those lamps to be blown. Please!
That's it. Everybody just help get away from the towers and clear them.
And look up, very seriously. Let's think hard to get rid of it, please.
No rain! No rain! No rain!
Keep thinking it!
Keep your eyes on those towers.
It's going to blow through.
Try and keep yourselves comfortable.
And keep an eye on the towers.
Hey, cut the power off up there, all right?
What do you want?
We're going to have to turn off some microphones for a minute.
Hang in there with us.
God bless you and watch those towers.
Let me get down with the mike.
Oh, can I talk to you a minute?
Sure. What do you want to know?
Do you like the rain?
Yes, yes. It's nice.
It, it gets you clean.
What are you thinking about?
Does, is this encouraging, or what?
Definitely not. It's great! Just a little added attraction, that's all.
You, at least, you don't have to wait for clothes to get dry.
Groovy! I dig it! I dig it!
Do you think it's coming off well with all those fuck-ups, or what?
Yes. The only, the only hassle is the mud, that's all.
Does this discourage you at all?
Or is it all right?
Mud. A drag!
I can't believe it!
Do you feel discouraged at all, or is this all right?
It's a bummer!
It's fine.
Peace, brother!
I've got something to say.
I want to know how come the Fascist pigs have been seeding the clouds?
Right! For the last hour and a half.
Going over twice with that, with all...
...with all the smoke coming out of them, seeding the clouds.
I want to know, know why that stuff is going down there.
And why doesn't the media report that stuff to the people?
You want to talk about what's happened?
I'm telling you these planes...
...come over an hour and a half and they seeded all the clouds.
This is the second time they did it today!
I don't know what they hope to prove, man.
What's going on here?
Sharon Silverstein, return home immediately.
Your father has been taken for open heart surgery.
Please stop at the information booth right away.
The first Aquarian Exposition.
The forecast for this afternoon is...
...intermittent entertainment between intermittent showers.
Somebody was saying this is the second largest city in New York.
There's been no police.
There's been no trouble.
If you check the statistics out...
...you'll find that...
...these people have lived, over three hundred thousand people...
...have lived together peacefully, loving each other...
...feeling for each other, want, needing for each other...
...and wanting to make this the experience it is.
What are they doing?
They're dropping dry, they're dropping flowers and dry clothes.
Out of that helicopter?
You said a moment ago that this wasn't the end of this festival...
...that this was a beginning.
What do you mean, a beginning?
Well, well, look at it!
This is the beginning of this kind of thing.
This culture and generation, away from the old culture and the older generation.
And you see how they function on their own.
Without cops, without guns, without clubs, without hassle.
Everybody pulls together and everybody helps each other and it works.
It's been working since we got here.
And it's going to continue working.
And no matter what happens when they go back to the city, this thing happened.
And it proves that it can happen.
That's what it's all about, you know.
That's the whole thing right there.
Mr. Kornfeld, was, was this a suc... , a financial success?
From the point of view of the fellows that put it on?
It was a financial disaster!
Why do you say that?
Well, we just opened the gates and let everybody in. It's a free festival...
...paid for by the people who put up the money...
...or the people that are going to have to pay it back?
Uh, paid for by the people who bought the tickets.
The two hundred thousand, of which I don't know how many of them got here.
No, this was paid for by, by all the people that bought it.
By all the people...
...that had the thought that put it to the point, to get us in a position...
...to just be a tool, like, like a vehicle...
...like everybody else.
Just to get it to this point.
You're in the red?
Oh? The company?
Financially? If you tried to think in those terms...
...when you're talking about something like this...
...financially, this is a disaster.
But you, you, you look so happy!
I'm very happy!
You can't buy that for anything!
Sure, this is really beautiful, man!
These people are communicating with each other.
That, that rarely happens anywhere anymore.
It has nothing to do with money.
It has nothing to do with tangible things.
You have to realize the turnabout...
...that I've gone through in the last, in the last three days.
In the last three million years that I, meaning us, all of us...
What do you mean, the turnabout in the last three days?
Just to see, just to really realize, what's really important.
The fact that, that if we can all live together and be happy...
...if you have to be afraid to walk out in the street...
...if you have to be afraid to smile at somebody...
...what kind of a way is that to go through this life?
Marijuana!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Waters, Country Joe and The Fish!
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
We're certainly delighted to be here today.
I'd like to start off my portion of the show...
...by giving you a taste of a little something we call...
...rock and soul music.
"Oh, your love is like a rainbow..."
"...your love is like a rainbow, darling. Now..."
"...your love is like a rainbow, I said..."
"...your love is like a rainbow, all around my shoulders, yeah..."
"...performing all around my shoulders."
"You know that your love is like a rainbow..."
"...falling all around my shoulders.
And I said I love you..."
"...you know I do!"
A lot of freaks!
"Coming in from London from over the Pole..."
"...flying in a big airliner..."
"...chickens flying everywhere around the plane."
"Could we ever feel much finer..."
"...coming into Los Angeles..."
"...bringing in a couple of keys?"
"Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customs Man."
"A guy with a ticket to Mexico..."
"...no, he couldn't look much stranger..."
"...walking in a hall with his things and all..."
"...smiling, said he was the Lone Ranger."
"Coming into Los Angeles..."
"...bringing in a couple of keys."
"Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customs Man."
"There's a hip woman walking on a moving block..."
"...tripping on the escalator."
"There's a man in the line, she's blowing his mind..."
"...thinking that he's already made her."
"Coming into Los Angeles..."
"...bringing in a couple of keys."
"Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customs Man."
"Coming in from London from over the Pole..."
"...flying in a big air liner..."
"...chickens flying everywhere around the plane."
"Could we ever feel much finer?"
Folk music has come a long way hasn't it, Arlo?
It used to be the walk down the road trip, you know.
It's incredible. I heard the
New York Throughway is closed.
This morning we heard they were backed down...
...on Route Seventeen with an eight hour delay!
Right. Well, the New York
State Throughway is closed.
It's incredible!
Isn't that far out?
I don't know if you,
I don't know how many...
...of you can dig how many people there are, man!
Like I was rapping to the fuzz.
Huh, can you dig it?
Man there are supposed to be a million and a half people here by tonight!
Can you dig that?
New York State Throughway is closed, man!
Yeah, it's far out, man!
Hey, man, I've just got to say...
...that you people...
...have got to be the strongest bunch of people I ever saw.
Three days, man, three days!
We just love you!
Tell them who we are.
They'll know if you just sing.
Test. Forty-nine. Sixty-five.
Hike!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome with us Crosby, Stills and Nash!
"It's getting to the point..."
"...where I'm no fun any more."
"I am sorry."
"Sometimes it hurts..."
"...so badly, I must cry out loud."
"I, I, I am lonely."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard."
"Remember what we said and did..."
"...and felt about each other."
"Oh, babe, have mercy."
"Don't let the past remind us of what we are, not now."
"I, I, I am not dreaming."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard."
"Tearing yourself away from me now."
"You are free, and I am crying."
"This does not mean I don't love you."
"I do. That's forever, baby."
"Yes, and for always."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard."
"Something inside is telling me that I've got your secret."
"Are you still listening?"
"Here is the lock and latch of the key to your heart."
"Yes, and I love you."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard, hard..."
"...and you make it hard, you make it hard."
"Friday evening..."
"...Sunday in the afternoon..."
"...what have you got to lose?"
"Tuesday morning..."
"...please be gone. I'm tired of you."
"What have you got to lose?"
"Can I tell it like it is?"
"Listen to me, baby..."
"...it's my heart..."
"...that's a sad feeling in your heart, and that's what I am."
"I've got an answer."
"I'm going to try and play."
"What have I got to lose?"
"Please come see me..."
"...Thursdays and Saturdays."
"What have you got to lose?"
"Chestnut brown canary..."
"...ruby-throated sparrow..."
"...sing a song, don't be long, thrill me to the marrow."
"Lacy, lilting, eerie."
"Ring around the moonlight."
"Asking me, said she so free..."
"...'How can you catch the sparrow?"'
"Lacy, lilting, eerie."
"Oozing life, not lamenting."
"Change my life, make it right.
Be my lady."
Thank you. We needed that!
This is our second gig.
This is the second time...
...we've ever played in front of people, man!
We're scared shitless!
That's near enough for jazz.
I'd like to say thank you again to you.
This is a thing called
"I'm Going Home by Helicopter."
"Going home, my baby."
"My baby, baby, I'm going home."
"Baby, baby, I'm going home."
"Baby, baby, I said I'm going home."
"Going home, my baby."
"Go home, my baby."
"'Go home, baby, I'm going."
"My baby, see my baby around."
"See my baby, see my baby around."
"Love you, baby,
I feel so good tonight."
"Going home, see my baby."
"I'm going home now, see my baby."
"Oh, baby, baby, see my wife."
"Ohh! Baby, going to have more fun."
"Baby, you don't go..."
"...baby, if we don't go..."
"If you don't go..."
"...baby, we don't go.
Man, you hurt me so."
"I love my baby with the red dress on."
"I'm going to shake it on a great big doll. I'm going to have more fun."
"Go back, baby, baby, I want to be a half with you."
"I love you, baby, Lord knows I do."
"I love you, baby, God knows I do."
"We're going steady, doll, that's what we're trying to do."
"Go on, baby, I love that way you walk."
"One for the money, two for the show.
Three to get ready, and go, cat, go, go!"
"Don't you step on my blue suede shoes."
"You can do anything, baby, but lay off my blue suede shoes!"
"Well, back it up, down in front."
"I've got a baby, mean as she can be."
"Not now, my baby, don't be mean to me."
"Yeah, I'm coming on, baby.
Oh, not sitting, going home."
"Climbing on, baby. Oh, I'm not sitting, going home."
"Well, baby, I'm not sitting.
Going home."
"Well, shake up, baby, shake.
Well, shake it, baby, shake."
"Shake up, baby, shake.
Shake, baby, shake."
"Well, love you, baby.
I love the way you walk to me."
"Oh, baby, I love that way you walk."
"I'll sit you right down, knock you off your feet."
"Whoa, baby, I've got a craving."
"I love you, baby, like God knows I do."
"Take your love, baby, yeah, one more time."
"Oh, do the stomp, do the stomp."
"I gave my baby, I gave one more time."
"Yeah, you quit, I'm going to see my baby."
"I'm going home.
Home to see my ba-baby."
"Oh, baby, I played the blues for you."
"Yeah, I love you, baby, with your red dress on."
"Baby, I love you so."
"I'm going home, I'm going home."
"Love you, baby.
Love that way you walk."
"I'm going home."
"Love you, baby. I'm going home."
"Look out, baby! I'm coming to get you!
One more time! Going home! "
"Yeah, home, baby.
Going home, home to my baby."
"Going home. I'm going home.
I'm going home."
"I'm going home, home, home, my baby."
"Going home to see my mama!"
Ten Years After!
Please a warm thank you for Ten Years After!
Alright friends, now you have seen the heavy groups...
...now you will see morning maniac music.
Believe me.
It's a new dawn.
The regular guys.
Don't you get a dial tone, or anything?
Yeah, there are some toilets around here, some of those rolling outhouses...
...like they had in Newport.
You ask for somebody that doesn't exist...
...and then they don't accept the charges and they know you're okay.
You cheat the telephone company.
Oh, yeah. I'm fine, man.
We don't take the car. We walk.
It's the only way to get there.
Why? Because my mother wants to make sure I'm all right.
I'm going to call my mother and father because...
...oh, they think this is going to be like another Chicago.
Like I'm going to get my head beaten in.
They're terrified. So I'm going to call and tell them...
..."Ha-ha, I fooled you. I'm alive!"
They've got, they've, you don't even have to bother bringing your tickets...
...or anything, because they're not going to collect them.
There's no way they can.
They've got a fence that's half up...
...and there are people just sitting in that field.
It's really beautiful.
I'll try. It's like I say, really, you know how crowded it is here.
It, it's just swarming! What?
Out, out on the ground.
It was nice. We got wet.
All I miss is the bathtub.
Okay. Goodbye.
I didn't even finish dialing and they said...
It's so great in some ways and so lousy in others.
Look at the people you're meeting.
Everybody is here for one purpose.
It's ridiculous!
It's getting worse every time.
There is no water. No water, no food and no medical supplies.
Why don't we pray for rain?
They're telling everybody to go home.
They called it a disaster area.
Oh, that's rot!
They called this a disaster?
You should see, everybody's happy!
Who are you calling?
My mother.
Somebody may have noticed, or all of you may have noticed...
...a familiar colored helicopter over there.
The United States Army has lent us some medical teams...
...and giving us a hand.
They're with us, man.
They are not against us.
They're here to give us all a hand and help us.
And for that they deserve it.
There are forty-five doctors or more.
I know at least forty-five...
...who are here without pay because they dig what this is into.
Look, it's acid and shit like that.
One kid died, a heroin overdose.
Yeah, another guy died.
Run over, I believe.
The army is really doing a great job, you know.
All those guys calling them pigs and shit like that, it's not right.
They've done a good job.
Dr. Jack Maitland, please, with full suturing equipment...
...your presence is requested.
You've got a delivery to make!
Marilyn Cohen. Wherever you are, Marilyn Cohen...
...Greg wants you to meet him at the information booth...
...because he wants to marry you!
There goes Marilyn!
About how long does it take to...?
Well, before it was backed up, eight hours.
And they've been working at it and there are still some cats...
...that think they can come here for Sunday.
And they're stopping them in Monticello and all that, you know...
...so it's really getting to be a mess.
So, you know what I would do?
I would wait, because this way...
There's no gas in the gas stations.
Because this is the third largest city in the world.
So I would wait, you know?
Until when?
Until this traffic starts clearing up.
You know, like Monday morning.
I've got to be in North
Carolina Monday morning.
Oh, wow! Do you? Why? A job?
Well, like what? This has been declared a disaster area.
Because I called long distance to Buffalo...
...and asked some cats there and they said...
...it definitely has been declared a disaster area.
Is there any way to get out?
They're trying to evacuate it today.
So maybe late tonight, you know.
You know, like one.
How are they going to evacuate?
We're not sure. I think they're trying to get all the cats in the cars...
...and just direct the cars to get out.
I mean, you can try it.
I mean, like it's all up to you, man.
But if your car gets, you know...
Yeah, if you run out of gas somewhere, there's no gas in the stations.
You're screwed.
Yeah, I mean, like you'd be even more stuck on the highway...
...than you are here, because...
...at least here there are a lot of other cats.
I have to get out of here because there are just too many people!
And I can't leave because my friends will be lost.
And I can't, I can't stay here any more. It's too crowded!
We are only taking drastic emergencies.
Nobody worries. Nobody up here has any money.
You could live and eat here a week without money, so don't worry about it.
I know, but I've got to go back to California.
You can get a ride to California, too.
You know, everybody here, it's the same thing with them, you know.
You just have to dig it and live with it.
About thirty hours, at least.
Thirty hours straight? No naps?
Are you on speed?
No, I'm not on anything.
Blind faith?
Blind Faith is a groovy group.
You wouldn't believe some of the kids that come in here.
They're really spaced out. Last night, this cat, this cat comes in and says...
..."If anger is red and envy is green, what color is jealousy?"
And I mean he's really spaced out!
And you just don't go fucking people's heads up when they're spaced out!
So I said, uh, "Black, right?
Because jealousy is poison."
He says, "Yeah, but it's got to be something else than that."
And I said, "Green, because after all, jealousy is like envy."
"Except that envy is over things and jealousy is over people."
"A lot of people treat other people as, you know, things."
And he says, "Wow! Groovy!"
And he walks off and I never saw that cat!
Another cat comes up and he asks me to tell him about his wild eyes!
Did he have wild eyes?
He was speeding. Really groovy.
And all the people that come up here asking, you know...
...if we can page their freaked out friends.
I mean, like right now
I'm missing my sister.
I lost her. She was on, uh, on mesc.
And I lost her during
Richie Haven's performance.
I've got her tickets home.
I haven't seen her since.
She's all right.
Sure she is.
It's just that I'd like to see her so I can get home in time.
She's got to be back Monday for Court.
Otherwise, you know, I wouldn't care.
Otherwise, I'd probably let her hitch home.
City McGee...
...please come immediately to backstage right.
I understand your wife is having a baby.
Congratulations!
John Sebastian!
This is really a mind fucker of all times, man!
I've never seen anything like this, man!
It's Newport, right? But they owned it.
It was something else!
Just love everybody around you, and clean up a little garbage...
...on your way out and everything is going to be all right.
And Chip. My man, Chip.
Aw, you're doing so well, man.
He says to look out for the fence, too, man. You have to look after the fence.
Like the, the press can only, can only say bad things unless there ain't no fuck-ups.
And it's looking like there ain't going to be any fuck-ups.
This is going to work!
I'd like to hear a tune about...
...I guess about those discussions
I was talking about that...
...small circles of friends around living rooms...
...around pipes, when they weren't selling any papers on the street...
...and we weren't walking around this beautiful green place smoking, and...
...not being afraid.
There's a cat, and I really don't even know his name...
...but I remember that Chip said that...
...his old lady just had a baby and that made me think.
Wow, it really is a city here!
But this is, this is for you and your old lady, man! Whew!
That kid is going to be far out!
"Why must every generation think their folks are square?"
"And no matter where their heads are, they know Moms ain't there."
"Because I swore when I was small, that I'd remember when..."
"...I knew what's wrong with them, that I was smaller, then."
"I determined to remember all the cardinal rules..."
"...like sun-showers are legal grounds for skipping school."
"I know I have forgotten maybe one or two..."
"...but I hope that I recall them all before the baby is due."
"And I know he'll have a question or two..."
"...like, 'Hey, Pop, can
I go ride my zoom..."
"...that goes two hundred miles an hour..."
"...suspended on balloons?"'
"'And I can put a droplet of this new stuff on my tongue..."
"...and imagine frothing dragons while you sit and wreck your lungs?"'
"And I must be permissive..."
"...understanding the younger generation..."
"...and then I'll know that all I've learned..."
"...and then I'll know that all I've learned, my kid..."
"...then I'll know that all I've learned, my kid assumes..."
"...and all my deepest worries must be his cartoons..."
"...and still I'll try to tell him all the things I've done..."
"...relating to what he can do when he becomes a man..."
"...and still he'll stick his fingers in the fan..."
"...and, 'Hey, Pop, my girl friend is only three..."
"...she's got her own bitty phone and she's taking LSD..."
"...and now that we're best friends, she wants to give a taste to me."'
"'But what's the matter, Daddy?
How come you look so mean?"'
"'Could it be that you can't live up to your dreams?"'
No, it's not true, because we're doing it! I love you. Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, John Sebastian!
Give me an "F"!
Give me a "U"!
Give me a "C"!
Give me a "K"!
What does that spell?
Fuck!
Sing it!
More! More!
Country Joe!
Sir? You live here?
I sure as hell do!
Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
I'm right here to answer them.
Have you been affected by this festival at all? In any way?
What? We lost all of our milk.
We're just trying to put together a film, to show what the whole picture was like.
You know, from all sides.
How do you feel about it?
Do you want me to explain in plain English?
A shitty mess!
Tell me, in what way?
No bathrooms.
Our hundred fifty acres.
Gone, that's all.
And we didn't rent to them.
They all trespassed, every one!
Clarence, first tell me where you want this to go.
Can I ask you a question?
Is it okay if we use your telephone?
Oh, we have none. It's out.
This is a disaster area.
We don't even have a phone.
It's been out since yesterday morning.
Water?
Water I can give you.
And I'm sorry the phone has been out, I had an emergency call.
It's a disgraceful mess, if you want to know the answer!
What, specifically, has happened to you?
My fields are all cut up.
Our second cutting of hay is going.
Our cows, the milk truck didn't get here.
The milk had to be thrown out.
May I ask you how much money you made on this, uh, four days?
I have no, no conception.
Did you make five thousand dollars? have no idea.
It's too private a question?
It's, it's not only too private,
I didn't even have a chance...
...to total up the amount of purchases we made...
...the amount of money we took in.
We just, uh, haphazardly sent it to our home...
...and had it locked up until we had a chance to sit down and count it...
...which would probably be in about, uh, two to three days.
Would you like to see it again next...?
I'd love to see it again!
You'd love to see it, though?
I can't say the farmers would.
Well, it, it's, it's a matter of opinion.
What are your feelings about the garbage?
Where there are people, there is garbage.
You, you can't stop, stop progress.
Saturday night we got word over WVOS that...
...a lot of kids in town didn't have anything to eat.
Word went out that everybody should contribute food.
We went over to the park...
...the village permitted them to camp there.
A police car went up the street here with a loud speaker...
...and told the kids to come up there.
And we fed them Saturday night and all day Sunday.
Excess stuff was taken over to the school and they flew it to the, to the site.
How do you feel about them now?
Very good. I have a nineteen-year-old myself.
He's out on the Coast, and I felt that we've got to give them a fair shake here.
If kids are hungry, you've got to feed them. I don't know...
...maybe we ought to put, we ought to put everybody on pot.
And those kids were all happy.
They were all on pot.
Well, whatever it is...
It never should have happened.
If pot makes them happy and no trouble...
...maybe we ought to put all the adults on pot!
You want a fifteen-year-old girl sleeping in the field in a tent?
What are you, out of your mind?
It never should have happened!
Do you feel bad about the kids who were killed in Vietnam?
This has nothing to do with...
It's the same thing. The same thing.
There's no comparison.
People get more excited about the kids in Monticello than they do about...
Fifteen-year-old kids sleeping in the field?
They wanted to.
They're all high on pot!
Look, maybe if pot made them peaceful, maybe we all should take pot!
I was giving them water all along the road here, right up on the bridge...
...and they were not on pot!
Very lovely children, believe me.
They were selling stuff.
There was plenty of stuff there.
There's no doubt about it.
They had hundreds of kids in that house.
If you have four hundred and fifty thousand kids...
...and you've got two or three hundred...
...they were selling these, these blue acid tablets...
...which are bad, and they were selling them.
True, but figure the law of averages.
If you took 500 adults and brought them together and had plenty of booze...
...you know what would have happened?
You didn't see any drunks.
That's right. There was no fighting.
There was nobody stealing.
We had to feed them! What the hell else was there to do?
There was nothing else to do!
Having a good time?
Very nice.
The water is nice.
We were all sitting on a tree stump over there.
And the more people got on it, the lower it got.
About a year ago, I wouldn't have believed this was the way to swim...
...but this is the way to swim!
It's the way to go all the time, actually.
Think that's going to happen?
It's got to happen!
You go walking down the street where all the cars were coming in...
...and it's just the first day, and it was just beautiful!
Everybody is free.
Everybody is talking.
Everybody is really nude.
I don't think, uh, people come here to get uptight.
They come here to dig what's going on.
And even if they don't get into a festival, it's just a groove...
...being with all the people.
You know, you realize all over the country, they're coming together.
You realize that you're not the only people in your city...
...who are doing the things you are, but they're everywhere.
We're taking over!
I think the body is beautiful.
I think skinny dipping is just beautiful if, if you want to do it, if you can do it.
Some people can't, because all their...
...their environment made them, you know, feel that it's wrong.
Even though they know in their subconscious that it's right...
...it's kind of normal and natural, but we've been made to feel that it's wrong.
Row, row, row!
"Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream..."
"...merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream."
No, I haven't done this too often before.
Get it pointed in the right direction!
Well, did I miss any big spots?
Your cheekbone.
Here?
Why don't you tell me something really interesting?
I can't, really, standing there with the microphone.
Don't worry about it. Don't let it intimidate you. It's just a microphone.
I know, but it's very intimidating.
Just tell me anything, like anybody you'd like to meet.
Oh, wow! I don't know.
What did you think about the kids?
From what I've heard from outside sources for many years...
...I was very, very much surprised.
And I'm very happy to say...
...we think the people of this country should be proud of these kids.
Notwithstanding the way they dress or the way they wear their hair.
That's their own personal business.
But their, their inner workings, their inner selves...
...their, their self-demeanor cannot be questioned.
They can't be questioned as good American citizens.
That's kind of surprising coming from a cop.
I'm not a cop. I'm a Chief of Police.
We've got one more tune for you.
It's called "Soul Sacrifice."
Ladies and gentlemen, Santana!
"I wanta, I wanta, I wanta, I wanta..."
"...take you higher."
"Baby, baby, baby, light my fire!"
"I'll take you higher."
"I wanta, I wanta, I wanta, I wanta..."
"...take you higher..."
"...take you higher..."
"...take you higher!"
"I wanta, I wanta take you higher!"
"I wanta, I wanta, wanta take you higher!"
What we would like to do is sing a song together.
Now, you see, what usually happens...
...you get a group of people that might sing...
...and for some reasons that are not unknown anymore, they won't do it.
Most of us need approval.
Most of us need to get approval from our neighbors...
...before we can actually let it all hang down, you dig?
But what is happening here...
...is a sing-along. Now, a lot of people don't like to do it...
...because they feel it might be old-fashioned.
But you must dig that it is not a fashion in the first place.
It is a feeling...
...and if it was good in the past, it's still good.
We would like to sing a song called "Higher"...
...and if we could get everybody to join in, we'd appreciate it.
"Wanta take you higher!"
"Higher!"
What I want you to do, is say "higher" and throw the peace sign up.
It will do you no harm.
Still again, some people feel that they shouldn't...
...because there are situations where you need approval...
...to get in on something that could be so good.
"I wanta take you higher!"
"Higher!"
Now, if you'll throw the peace sign up and say "higher", get everybody to do it.
There's a whole lot of people here and a whole lot of people...
...might not want to do it...
...because they can somehow get around it...
...they feel there are enough people to make up for it...
...and on and on, et cetera.
We're going to try higher again, and if we get everybody to join in...
...we'd appreciate it.
It will do you no harm.
"Yeah, I wanta take you higher!"
"Higher!"
"Way upon a hill, I'll take you higher!"
"Yeah, I'll take you higher!"
"Going to take you higher!"
"Higher!"
How are you out there?
You're staying stoned and you've got enough water...
...and you've got a place to sleep, and everything?
Good morning.
What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for four hundred thousand.
Now, it's not going to be steak and eggs, or anything...
...but it's going to be good food and we're going to get it to you.
It's not just the Hog Farm, either.
It's like the Ohio Mountain family and the Pranksters...
...and everybody else that volunteered...
...putting in their time into the free kitchens. In fact, it's everybody.
We're all feeding each other.
We must be in heaven, man!
There's always a little bit of heaven in a disaster area.
So, if you want to make it back to your campsites, we'll try and get the food to you.
Or if you stay here, we'll try and get the food to you.
Now, there's a guy up there, some hamburger guy...
...had his stand burned down last night.
But he's still got a little stuff left...
...and for you people that still believe that capitalism isn't that weird...
...you might help him out and buy a couple of hamburgers.
Okay, here it comes! Mess call!
Good morning.
Left side of the audience, stage right here...
...that wants to be fed...
...has got to slowly move it through the forest...
...to the Hog Farm where we've got about seventeen lines going, uh, to serve with.
If you start your lines going through the forest, you'll wind up...
...going into a line that will take you right to where all the food is being served.
Helen Hayman, to the front.
Jim MacLean, please go to the pink and white tent hospital as soon as possible.
And kissing builds up your mouth.
Richard Moss and Barbara, meet us at the information booth.
Cort Ritcher or Greg Hollander, go to the Ferris wheel at twelve o'clock.
Greg's sister has his medicine.
Okay, Gayle, wow!
S, i, r, i, n, c, i, o, n, e...
...meet your daddy-o at the first aid station, near the security office.
If you've got food, feed other people.
Bugsy, to the pink and white tent.
Keep feeding each other.
And if you're too tired to chew, pass it on.
We have a gentleman with us.
It's the gentleman upon whose farm we are. Mr. Max Yasgur!
Is this on?
I'm a farmer. I don't know...
I don't know how to speak to...
...twenty people at one time, let alone a crowd like this!
But I think you people have proven something to the world.
Not only to the town of Bethel, or
Sullivan County, or New York State...
...you've proven something to the world.
This is the largest group of people ever assembled in one place.
We have had no idea that there would be this size group...
...and because of that you had quite...
...a few inconveniences as far as water and food and so forth.
Your producers have done a mammoth job to see that you're taken care of.
They would enjoy a vote of thanks.
But above that, the important thing that you've proven to the world...
...is that a half a million kids...
...and I call you kids, because I have children that are older than you are...
...a half a million young people can get together...
...and have 3 days of fun and music and have nothing but fun and music.
And I, God bless you for it!
I see we meet again.
"Purple haze was in my brain."
"Lately things don't seem the same."
"I'm acting funny, but I don't know why."
"Excuse me while I kiss the sky."
"Purple haze all around."
"Don't know if I'm coming up or down."
"Am I happy or in misery?"
"Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me."
"Help me, baby. Help me, baby!"

Good morning! It's one minute to five, and it's a beautiful day.
It's time for me to go.
Catch you tomorrow night-
- with the latest and greatest in country music.
All you truck-drivers, late-nighters and early risers - remember:
What you see is what you get.
This is Ashley Wallace...
Thanks for keeping me company.
ABBA - the hottest property on the pop scene.
They sell sixty million records around the world.
- ABBA?
- Yep. How does this grab you:
"Radio 2TW will present, on the night of their departure from these shores"-
- "a two hour ABBA radio special.
For the first time"-
- "your favourite country and western host turns ace reporter."
That's really not my bag, is it?
Come on, it's a good challenge.
Take it!
We want ABBA!
I know it's a rush, but I want it on air 7.30 the night they leave.
That gives you one week.
What about Lenny?
I mean, Lenny handles the pop scene.
Lenny's not on. He's too slick, he's too superficial.
I want an exclusive, in-depth interview with the people themselves.
ABBA, the people. The real people.
We want ABBA!
I want an interview.
I want a gut-level dialogue.
An exclusive, gut-level... dialogue.
You know what I mean?
You don't want me to interview...
You don't want me to interview them?
- You want me to just have a chat?
- Come on. You know what I mean.
Yeah... But...
Get inside their heads. I don't want to know what they have for breakfast.
I want to know what they think, what they feel, what they fear...
- What they hate!
- Sure. Right. I understand.
We want ABBA!
Listen... The pop scene's never been touched like this before.
Really?
We want ABBA!
I mean... It's a good idea.
I mean, about not sort of being an interview.
A slice of life. Got me?
We want ABBA!
Good on you, Ash, my boy.
Your deadline's the night that ABBA departs these shores.
- 7.30 tonight week.
- Right. Okay. Good.
Go.
Go - right.
We want ABBA!
Are you sure you want me to do this documentary?
Don't use that word.
It's not a documentary, it's an event!
This is going to be worldwide.
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
Lots of cameras around.
What do you want us to do?
- What's all this?
- I don't know.
Hello!
A little wave.
Excuse me, pal... Do you know what time ABBA are arriving?
- 9 o'clock, I think.
- Where are they coming through?
I really don't know.
You all right?
All right... See you!
Excuse me, what time are ABBA coming through?
- They've gone out the back door.
- The back door?
But I have to interview them.
You'll just have to wait for the press conference, won't you?
- It's on in half an hour.
- Do you know where?
ABBA wishes to thank their supporters for coming- and are sorry they cannot see them.
- I'd like to rent a car, please.
- Do you have a reservation?
No, I don't, but... just any car.
Any car, as long as it's fast.
And now we take you back to the ABBA press conference.
Here they are - ABBA.
They've finally hit Australia for their long-awaited tour.
- What?!
- ABBA, the pop group.
- Do you know where they're staying?
- Who?
The pop group - ABBA.
Do you know where they're staying?
Any performer gets very nervous before going on stage.
Do you still go through that traumatic experience before you go on stage?
Every show is a bit nervous before you...
You think you have a good performance-
- because you had a good audience the day before.
But going from Amsterdam to London-
- or from London to Sydney, is such a difference.
I'd hate the sound of 30,000 people booing.
Excuse me, is this the right jam for King's Cross?
- No, it's back that way.
- Thanks.
I think the travelling is very very hard.
Come on!
One day when I woke up during our European tour...
...I started to think "Where am I?
In which city?" And it's terrible.
I think that it's a bit of an asocial life on tour.
You just eat, sleep, go on stage, and nothing more.
And it kills creativity in a way that I don't like.
It's boring to travel, but it's fantastic to be on stage. I love that.
- Move!
- The biggest pop group ever...
The groups arrival in Australia has been accompanied by a blaze of publicity.
According to the promoters
They are bigger than The Beatles.
And with an entourage of 105 people-
- they are almost twice as big as The Rolling Stones concert.
While they are here they’ll perform eleven concerts in ten days- to a nest, mated 140000 people.
ABBA are obviously very big business-
- and the organizers are treating them like royalty.
They’ve even arranged a civic reception for them in Melbourne.
Do you take drugs or alcohol, or anything like that?
- No drugs.
- You're clean?
No, not clean, but we don't take any drugs.
The four of you admit that you are now millionaires.
Are you worried that you make money faster than you can spend it?
No. It's a lot of money coming in, but there's a lot of tax to pay-
- if you're a Swedish citizen, which is fair. But still, it's...
It's a matter of hard work, and the money isn't that important.
Really, it's more a matter of pleasing yourselves in what you're doing.
We can't do anything else in the future-
- than trying to keep ourselves happy in our work.
I' d like to direct a couple of questions to Agnetha if I may...
I read somewhere w here you are the proud owner of an award-
- which declares you as the lady with the sexiest bottom.
Is that true?
How can I answer that?
I don't know.
I haven't seen it!
Thank you ABBA. Thank you ladies and gentlemen of television.
Excuse me.
Do you know where ABBA are?
- I think they've left.
- They've left... They've gone?
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
Have you filmed the umbrellas out there? It's a fantastic sight.
Agnetha, I have...
...four kilos of make-up.
- Is the make-up artist here?
- Where could she be...?
- She'll come if you ask her.
Don't go out and get your hair wet, okay?
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
Because the only thing I'm worried about is that the power just stops.
The opening?
Just walk out there.
I don't think there's much we can do, really, with the wind and the rains...
There's not a lot we can do.
We want ABBA!
Ten minutes to the show of a lifetime!
The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner and try not to scream
It's me
I am behind you,
I always find you,
I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me,
I am the tiger
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
I am behind you,
I always find you,
I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me,
I am the tiger
The city is a prison, you never escape
You're forever trapped in the alleys
Look into the shadows and you'll see the shape
Of me
I am behind you,
I'll always find you,
I am the tiger
People who fear me never go near me,
I am the tiger
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights
I am behind you,
I'll always find you,
I am the tiger
And if I meet you, what if I eat you,
I am the tiger, tiger, tiger!
Thank you!
All right. All right.
- Can I see your press card, please?
- I haven't got my card on me.
I'm sorry, but I can't let you in if you haven't got a card. Okay.
But I'm a radio announcer.
I've got to get an interview with them.
There's nothing I can do. If you haven't got a card, you can't get in.
- I'll buy a ticket. How much are they?
- Sold right out.
I haven't got one left.
I'm very sorry.
Hello, Sydney!
Very glad to see you!
I'll tell you one thing:
You make us forget the rain.
I just hope that we can make you forget it, too!
Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S.O.S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S.O.S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on
You seemed so far away though you were standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love, it used to be so good
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me
S.O.S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me
S.O.S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on
ABBA tickets for sale... ABBA tickets going cheap. Want any tickets, mate?
- Want any ABBA tickets?
- Are you selling tickets?
- How much? I'll buy one.
- 50 bucks.
50 dollars? I haven't got 50 dollars.
You ain't gonna see ABBA then, are you?
Money, money, money
Must be funny in the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny in the rich man's world
Aha-ahaaa, all the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
It's a rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad
So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same
Money, money, money
Must be funny in the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny in the rich man's world
Aha-ahaaa, all the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
Money, money, money
Must be funny in the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny in the rich man's world
Aha-ahaaa, all the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
It's a rich man's world
Thank you, Sydney!
The Sydney Opera House?
They should be there, mate, that's what they reckon.
Terrific. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Could you... hold this?
Could you, sort of, hold it in the middle?
Let's have a smile.
Down. Lower! Down a bit.
That's it.
- Happy now.
- What do you mean, "happy"?
Excuse me...
Is it possible to have a talk?
Not now.
Go somewhere and have a quiet talk?
I know that this is an incredible hassle for you... with all these people.
I can understand these problems that you have-
- but if we can go somewhere quiet...
Have a drink or something to eat.
Go back. Press photographers only.
- Can we go somewhere quiet...?
- You can't go anywhere with them.
No interviews today at all, it's just press photographers.
I was a fighter always looking for trouble
And my life was so empty, there was nothing left to live for
But then it happened one night as I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying as though he was praying
Treat him well, he is your brother
You might need his help one day
We depend on one another
Love him, that's the only way
On the road (on the road) that we're going
We all need (we all need) words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother
Love him, that's the only way
I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody
But then I happened to meet a begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying
I heard someone saying
Treat him well, he is your brother
You might need his help one day
We depend on one another
Love him, that's the only way
On the road (on the road) that we're going (that we're going)
We all need (we all need) words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother (brother)
Love him, that's the only way
Yeah, yeah, sure. Everything's fine.
There's no need to worry.
I met them at the airport, we spoke for quite a long time...
Yes. Yes. There's just one thing:
- I have to go to Perth.
- Perth?
That's 2,000 miles and a very expensive airfare away.
Yes, I know that, but you wanted the close personal story, and they...
That's the way it has to be.
I have to get to know them.
They have to trust me.
I want every listener on 2TW to share ABBA with you-
- and me and all of us, privately.
Right?
Don't worry.
I'll get the personal side.
No, no, no. I'll be able to edit and record as I go.
I've already got some interviews in the street-
- some comments on people, how they feel about the group. Yeah.
Oh! Also...
Could you send my press card to Perth?
I left in such a rush that I left it in the studio.
- Can I help you?
- Yes.
Could I...
Can I have these two T-shirts, please.
I'll take this as well. Thank you.
Thank you.

Why do you like ABBA?
I suppose it's... It has a good beat.
It's got good rhythm,
I think the lyrics are good.
I think it's appealing to all people.
When a little baby of about eighteen months can say "ABBA"-
- and recognize the pictures and recognize the music...
...I think it even appeals to the very, very young as well, you see.
What do you like most about their music?
Well, I like the clean-cut beat of the music...
- Just the beat?
- No, the beat...
And the clean-cut appearance of them.
They're a fantastic group.
What do you think of their...?
...because I think they're nice and clean.
- What do you mean by that?
- They've always dressed nicely...
...and tidy. I think that's what we all like, the older people.
I don't know about the kids, but we do, anyway.
It's a bit quieter than the more modern ones at the moment.
Not quite as loud.
Well, they look tidy on stage, even though they have nice costumes.
Some of the groups today look positively ugly on stage.
I think they appeal to the young children, too.
Perth Wednesday interview number five:
What do you like most about their music?
Make me very happy.
Make me wanna get up, and dance.
- And... Just everything.
- Thank you.
Thank you. Thank...
- Are you an ABBA fan?
- Not particularly. I hate them.
I've got a 12-year-old ABBA nut.
He's got the records and posters.
The house is full of them.
It's as much as a man can stand.
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, o-o-o-oh
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
Bye bye, leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
Bye bye doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go
- Hi. Has my press card arrived yet?
- Just a moment, sir.
No, I'm sorry.
There's no mail at all for you.
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
We want ABBA!
Look, can't you see I'm a journalist?
But you haven't got a press card, and we're all sold out.
There's nothing I can do, I'm sorry.
Excuse me. I'm doing some interviews.
Are you an ABBA fan?
- Yes, I am.
- What do you like about the group?
Well... They're a clean-cut group...
...with nice music and a nice beat.
That's great. Fantastic.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me...
Do you know where ABBA are?
- Yes, they're straight through there.
- Good. Thank you.
Very nice.
- What do you think you're doing here?
- L-l-I've...
...got an interview...
- Who with?
- ABBA!
- Who said?
- Stig Anderson, their manager.
- Well, show me your press pass.
- You haven't got a press pass.
- Well, I have, but I...
You haven't got an interview either, have you?
- Out!
- But listen...

You’re something I’d been pleading for
I love you, I adore you

And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I’ve been waiting for you
Oh, I’ve been waiting for you
And finally it seems my lonely days are through
I’ve been waiting for you
I’ve been waiting for you
ABBA - which floor?
Number 5, but you haven't got a chance!
That's okay, I'm a professional.
- The Sydney reviews.
- Thank you.
Would you give me that one, please.
- What does "kinky" mean?
- Kinky? It's a...
...sort of a perversion.
Usually sexual perversion.
What do they find kinky?
- "ABBA's kinky, velvet bed."
- "Velvet" what?
- Velvet bed.
- Bed.
"This is the giant bed
Agnetha and Bjorn ordered"-
"to be ready at the hotel."
"And the manager made sure their dressing-gowns were ready"-
"when the super group arrived."
What a kinky journalist.
Your bottom was the best thing in the show.
- "Agnetha's bottom tops show!"
- Oh, my God...
Don't they have bottoms in Australia?
"'Damn! ', a middle-aged man beside me said with feeling."
"It's really something worth seeing."
I suppose he thought that was a very funny headline.
At least I did something for the show, didn,t I?
Nah, nah, nah.
None of that stuff here, okay?
No, it's okay.
I've got an appointment.
I have an appointment...
I've got an appointment with them.
Nah.
That's a really interesting sound you're making. I collect funny sounds.
- Would you like to do it in there?
- Nah, nah.
Thank you. I think I've got it.
Nah, nah. Cut that shit out.
Look, there's no need to shove!
That was pretty dangerous for a while, wasn't it? The rain on the stage?
- No, not really.
- You were very lucky.
- You didn't hurt yourself.
- Yes, really.
Excuse me.
Cut it out!
Listen, pal.
I ought to shove this microphone-
- so far down your throat I could record your stomach talking to you...
Haven't I seen enough of you today?
Guided tour is this way!
This is known as an elevator. It goes up and down, and you're going down.
Benny!
Bjorn!
THE NAME OF THE GAME
I've seen you twice, in a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted
I was an impossible case
No-one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know..
What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow
And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know..
The name of the game
I have no friends, no-one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited
Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know..
What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow
And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you, would you let me down?
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?
Could you feel the same way too?
I wanna know..
Oh yes I wanna know..
The name of the game
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?
Hello?
Good morning!
Everything is going really well here.
Everything's fine.
There's just one small problem.
I have to tag along with them to Adelaide.
Adelaide...
Ever-Lovin' Adelaide is taking a chance with you, Ashley.
Listen, you don't have to worry.
I know them all quite well...
...but the time is not ripe yet for an interview.
I'm trying to remain friends with you, but you're making it bloody difficult!
They have to have confidence in me.
It's too early.
Do you know what I mean?
All right, go to Adelaide.
But please, Ashley, get that dialogue we spoke of!
I'm sorry. I didn't get that.
The dialogue!
Oh, the dialogue! Yes.
The dialogue...
That's exactly why I wanted to wait.
0h... Just one more thing.
My press card.
Can you send it on to Adelaide?
Great. Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Shortly we will be landing in Adelaide.
Please fasten your seatbelts-
- and make sure that your seat is in an upright position.
They have a very distinctive, a very individual sound-
- which is all their own, which is very difficult for others to copy.
The girls' voices have their own special sound.
They utilize the technical facilities of a studio to the utmost.
I believe it was an English critic that commented that if you took-
- an ABBA song apart and laid all the different pieces, out before you-
- there would be only one way to put the song back together again-
- and that's the way, of course, that they had originally done it.
- Okay...
- It's inflated.
- I thought it would hang...
- It's like a cloud.
- It looks good.
- It's a really good roof.
What do you like about their songs?
It's got type of... a feeling that, you know, you're happy.
I just like them. I don't know why I do.
I just like them.
There's nothing really special about them.
They're only human beings...
Except their music.
That's what's special.
Right. Listen, I just want to recheck with you on the arrival arrangements- in Melbourne on Saturday morning.
Start with violins and then the chellos.
There's only two violas.
Somebody, give me a hand with this.
Very comfortable! Very comfortable.
Their image is very clean-
- and it does provide a large contrast to a great number of popular groups.
They don't have anything to do with chains and violence.
Their music and their performance has to do with having a good time.
I think most parents react very favourably to ABBA.
At the concerts amongst the public-
- you see sometimes two even three generations of a family.
Just a small portion.
Could you rip it off please!
I think it would be very wise if you all slow ed down a little bit-
- and just took your time and s at down. There is plenty of room.
Well they are not like other groups you know that get up-
- and sort of go crazy play their guitars and shake their heads.
- Thanks very much.
- 0kay.
ABBA books and posters! 75 cents each!
ABBA buttons!
Get your ABBA buttons here!
- I don’t much...
- What don’t you like about ABBA?
- They show off too much.
- How do they show off?
They just wear too many...
They just wear too many clothes.
And too much make-up. That's all.
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
Why Did It Have To Be Me
When you were lonely, you needed a man
Someone to lean on, well I understand
It's only natural
But why did it have to be me?
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural
But why did it have to be me?
I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me
Men are toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw them away
That's only natural
But why did it have to be me?
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural
But why did it have to be me?
I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me
Well, I like them...
...very much.
They are very nice people.
Would you like to tell me why you like ABBA?
Because I sing it...
- I'm sorry. Could you tell me again?
- I sing it.
You sing it?
I like the songs, and it's really good.
What do you like about the songs?
The parts that are good.
What parts are good?
The songs are good, because their names are good.
And one of the men is sexy, you know.
They look sexy.
- Do you think ABBA are sexy?
- Uh-uh. Nice.
So do I. I think they're nice, but it's a bit sexy.
- Sexy?!
- Sexy...
..... taken by surprise
When I kissed the teacher
Couldn¨t quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
And I couldn´t help it,
I just had to kiss the teacher
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright
What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher
All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher
When I kissed the teacher
Hey,
I'll tell you something about ABBA!
Do you know that ABBA's in the Bible?
It means "father".
- It's in Mark.
- I didn't know that.
The Gospel according to St. Mark.
Chapter 16.
"Abba the Father", it says. He told me.
I thought he was pulling my leg.
It's right in there. A-b-b-a.
Abba - Father.

- we will give them a two-hour ABBA radio special.
In depth, with warmth... and sincerity. get on the carouse
Please, Ashley...
Please?
Hey you!
Excuse me...
You are ABBA's manager, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.
- I hope you can help me.
- I have to get an interview with ABBA.
- Ignore this man, Mr. Anderson.
- He's crazy.
- Take it easy, will you!
I'm doing a radio special, and it has to be on air tomorrow night.
I really need that interview.
But Mr. Anderson...
I'm really desperate.
If you're down in the reception by 10 o'clock tomorrow morning...
...I will arrange this for you. Okay?
- For sure?
- I'll get to talk to them?
- Okay. Bye-bye.
From concert to concert from town to town as though her whole world was spinning
She got what she wanted, and yet she feels like a marionette!
You're so free
That's what everybody's telling me
Yet I feel I'm like an outward-bound, pushed around, refugee
Something's wrong, got a feeling that I don't belong
As if I have come from outer space, out of place, like King Kong
I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette,
'round and 'round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown
Like a doll, like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody taught me how to talk, how to walk, how to fall
Can't complain,
I've got no-one but myself to blame
Something's happening I can't control, lost my hold, it's insane
Look this way, just a little smile, is what they say
You look better on the photograph if you laugh, that's okay!!
I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette,
'round and 'round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown
I'm a marionette
Something's wrong, got a feeling that I don't belong
As if I have come from outer space, out of place, like King Kong
I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette,
'round and 'round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown
I'm a marionette
Two. Three.
Four. Five.
Six. Seven.
Eight. Nine. Ten.
Hurry!,
They're 3,80 dollars.
One, two, three, four - and again.
One, two, three, four.
Okay, and we change across.
Down again. One, two, three, four.
Last time.
One, two, three, four.
So sit down please. There are a lot of children behind you-
- who want to en joy this concert as much as you. Don’t you?
It is time to get your rocks on!
First row, right? Thank you.
Every body on stage!
All right! Ten minutes and away we go!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Thank you. Thank you so much.
- I'm goanna talk to them tomorrow.
- Really?
- Yeah. Interview them.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

Be good, be good...
You’ve been sitting for a long time now so its about time you got up-
- because were gonna play a dancing number for you - "Dancing Queen".
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come in to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music’s high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You’re in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen
You’re a teaser, you turn ’em on
Leave them burning and then you’re gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You’re in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...
You are the dancing queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the dancing queen
Dig in the dancing queen
Dig in the dancing queen
Why the hell didn't you wake me up?
...and music, dancing and singing.
Just like we do here in Moomba for the Moomba Festival.
Let's get together and have fun!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
We want ABBA!
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
The Moomba Festival presents the last appearance of ABBA in Australia.
- I suppose they've gone already?
- Who?
- ABBA.
- They just left for the airport.
- They've just...
- They've just gone.
...for the airport?
- I'm afraid so.
Is there anyone else you wish to speak to?
You're beautiful.
Testing one, two. Testing one, two...
Aaaaaah!
So long, see you honey
You can’t buy me with your money
Chasing, dazing, driving me crazy
But I’ll never be your girl
So long, see you honey
You can’t buy me with your money
You know it’s not worth trying
So long, so long, so long
So long, see you honey
You can’t buy me with your money
You know it’s not worth trying
So long, so long, so long
- Thank you.
- We love you!
Goodbye!
Mr. Wallace...
Your press card's arrived.
Keep it. It's yours.
Excuse me... I'd just like to...
Can I have a... an interview...?
- Sure.
- Lf I can just... get this...
If you just...
"Eagle"
They came flying from far away, now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell
They've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand
And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?
And I dream I'm an eagle.
And I dream I can spread my wings
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
High, high, I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high, what a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please 
That was absolutely fantastic.
Thank you very much!
I have got everything I need.
That's just great.
Fantastic. Thank you.
It's been a pleasure meeting you.
You're fantastic.
Have a nice trip home! Thank you.
Love you, buddy boy!
Righto, see you soon.
We made it!
Not now...
Radio 2... Radio 2TW, and make it fast.
Right. Hang on to your hat.
- What are you up to?
- Radio special on ABBA.
ABBA?
You're not with that mob, are you?
Strewth. I took the wife and kids to see them the other night.
Bloody terrible it was.
Cost me a fortune.
I thought it'd be the nicest, cleanest show I could take the wife and kids to.
Not on your life, mate!
They came dancing out on stage- all dolled up in these white cloaks.
And before you know it, they rip half their clothes off!
And instead of facing the audience with the microphones in their hand...
And this sheila had on the tightest pair of white slacks you ever saw.
...she suddenly turns her back on the audience and starts flapping her...
You know what I mean. Starts flashing at the audience. Doing this sort of thing.
Can you drive a bit faster?
I can't hear you.
Could you please move a little.
People were so nice, you know, and we had a really good time.
We've had such a good time, and I'd really like thank everybody- for supporting us so much.
There she was with what they say is the most beautiful bottom in Europe.
I've seen a few bottoms in my time,
I guess it was pretty nice.
We're both red-blooded males.
I quite admired it in a way-
- because I can take that sort of thing, but not in front of the wife and kids!
And it's not the sort of thing you want to go flashing at them.
Not in front of, literally, thousands of little kids. Flashing it away there.
Goodbye!
- "I am a tiger..."
- Keep the change.
What sort of a song is that?
We want ABBA! We want ABBA!
Just in time, Ashley.
- In studio 2.
- Right!
- Hi.
- We thought you'd never make it.
Neither did I.
- Okay. I'll go and tell Jim.
- Thanks.
- Benny...
- A pleasure working with you.
- See you again.
- Bye-bye. All the best.
- All right.
- Practice the outside inside, all right?
- Practice the inside outside.
- I'll practice some of it.
Thank you. This is a crazy thing, you know - leaving everything.
This is Ashley Wallace, back from Sydney...
...Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne, with...
...a two-hour special, including an exclusive, on-the-spot interview- with those super-Swedes, ABBA.
There’s nothing really special about them.
They’re only human beings...
- Are we on the air?
- Everything’s okay.
- We're on the air...
- Except their music. That’s special.
We're on the air!
I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it,
I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan
So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it,
I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
I've been so lucky,
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it,
I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
So I say
Thank you for the music,
For giving it to me

Here they come.
I'd like the parents and the grandparents.
Yes, all the close family.
Smile! Hold fast. Beautiful!
Congratulations.
Well...
I guess we really did it, huh?
You and Betty have been inseparable...
...since you met in
Dr. Scott's courses.
Tell you the truth, Brad, she was the only reason I came in the first place.
I mean...
Okay, guys, this is it!
You ready?
Look, Betty's gonna throw her bouquet.
I got it!
- I got it!
- Hey, big fella.
Looks like it could be your turn next.
Who knows.
So long.
See you, Brad.
Come on, hop in.
See you, Brad.
Brad, wasn't it wonderful?
Didn't Betty look radiantly beautiful?
Just an hour ago she was plain old Betty Munroe.
And now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt.
- Yes, Janet. Ralph's a lucky guy.
- Yes.
Oh, I always cry at weddings.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Yes.
Ralph will be in line for promotion in a year.
Yes.
- Hey, Janet.
- Yes, Brad?
I've got something to say.
I really loved
The skillful way
You beat the other girls
To the bride's bouquet
Oh, Brad.
- The river was deep but I swam it
- Janet
- The future is ours, so let's plan it
- Janet
- So please don't tell me to can it
- Janet
I've one thing to say and that's
Damn it, Janet
I love you
- The road was long but I ran it
- Janet
- A fire's in my heart and you fan it
- Janet
- There's one fool for you and I am it
- Janet
I've one thing to say and that's
Damn it, Janet
I love you
Here's a ring to prove
That I'm no joker
There's three ways
That love can grow
That's good, bad
Or mediocre
Oh, J-A-N-E-T
I love you so
- Oh, it's nicer than Betty Munroe had
- Oh, Brad
- Now we're engaged and I'm so glad
- Oh, Brad
- That you met Mom and you know Dad
- Oh, Brad
I've one thing to say and that's
Brad, I'm mad
For you too
Oh, Brad
Oh, damn it
I'm mad
Oh, Janet
For you
I love you too
There's one thing left to do
Ah-ooh
- And that's go see the man who began it
- Janet
- When we met in his science, exam it
- Janet
- Made me give you the eye, then panic
- Janet
Now I've one thing to say and that's
Damn it, Janet
I love you
Damn it, Janet
Oh, Brad, I'm mad
Damn it, Janet
I love you
I would like, if I may...
...to take you on a strange journey.
It seemed a fairly ordinary night...
...when Brad Majors and his fiancée, Janet Weiss...
...two young, ordinary, healthy kids...
...left Denton that late November evening...
...to visit a Dr. Everett Scott...
...ex-tutor and now friend to both of them.
It's true there were dark storm clouds...
...heavy, black and pendulous...
...toward which they were driving.
It's true also that the spare tire they carried...
...was badly in need of some air.
But they, being normal kids and...
...on a night out...
...they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening.
On a night out.
It was a night out...
...they were going to remember...
...for a very long time.
I have never been a quitter.
To leave office before my term
is completed is abhorrent...
... to every instinct in my body.
But as president...
... I must put the interests
of America first.
America needs a full-time president...
... and a full-time Congress...
... particularly at this time...
Gosh, that's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.
They sure do take their lives in their hands.
Yes, Janet. Life's pretty cheap to that type.
What's the matter, Brad, darling?
We took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh.
Where did that motorcyclist come from?
I guess we'll just have to turn back.
What was that bang?
We must have a blowout.
Damn it! I knew I should've gotten that spare tire fixed.
You stay here and I'll go for help.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Didn't we pass a castle a few miles back?
Maybe they have a telephone
I could use.
I'm going too.
- Both of us don't need to get wet.
- I'm coming with you.
Besides, the owner of that phone might be a beautiful woman...
...and you might never come back again.
In the velvet darkness
Of the blackest night
Burning bright
There's a guiding star
No matter what
Or...
... who you are
There's a light
Over at the Frankenstein place
There's a light
Burning in the fireplace
There's a light, light
In the darkness
Of everybody's life
The darkness must go
Down the river
Of nights dreaming
Flow morphia slow
Let the sun
And light come streaming
Into my life
Into my life
There's a light
Over at the Frankenstein place
There's a light
Burning in the fireplace
There's a light
Light
In the darkness
Of everybody's life
And so...
...it seemed that fortune had smiled on Brad and Janet...
...and they had found the assistance that their plight required.
Or had they?
Brad, let's go back.
I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Just a moment, Janet.
They may have a phone.
Hello.
Hi! My name's Brad Majors.
This is my fiancée, Janet Weiss.
I wondered if you might help us.
Our car broke down up the road.
Do you have a phone we might use?
You're wet.
Yes, it's raining.
Yes.
Oh.
I think, perhaps, you better both come inside.
You're too kind.
I'm frightened.
What kind of place is this?
It's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
This way.
Are you having a party?
You've arrived on a rather special night.
- It's one of the master's affairs.
- Oh.
- Lucky him.
- You're lucky.
He's lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky!
It's astounding
Time is fleeting
Madness takes its toll
But listen closely
Not for very much longer
I've got to keep control
I remember
Doing the time warp
Drinking
Those moments when
The blackness would hit me
And the void would be calling
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
It's just a jump to the left
- And a step to the right
- With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
It's so dreamy
Oh, fantasy free me
So you can't see me
No, not at all
In another dimension
With voyeuristic intention
Well secluded
I see all
With a bit of a mind flip
You're into the time slip
And nothing can ever be the same
You're spaced out on sensation
Like you're under sedation
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
I was walking down the street
Just having a think
When a snake of a guy
Gave me an evil wink
He shook a me up
He took me by surprise
He had a pickup truck
And the devil's eyes
He stared at me
And I felt a change
Time meant nothing
Never would again
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
It's just a jump to the left
- And then a step to the right
- With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
It's just a jump to the left
- And then a step to the right
- With your hands on your hips
Bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
Let's do the time warp again
Let's do the time warp again
Say something.
Say! Do any of you guys know how to Madison?
- Brad, please, let's get out of here.
- Keep a grip on yourself, Janet.
- But it seems so unhealthy here.
- It's just a party, Janet.
- Well, I want to go.
- We can't till I get to a phone.
- Then ask the butler or someone.
- Just a moment.
We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
This isn't the Chamber of Commerce.
They're probably foreigners with different ways.
They may do some more folk dancing.
I'm cold, I'm wet and
I'm just plain scared.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
How do you do
I see you've met
My faithful handyman
He's just a little brought down
Because when you knocked
He thought you were the candyman
Don't get strung out
By the way I look
Don't judge a book by its cover
I'm not much of a man
By the light of day
But by night I'm one hell of a lover
I'm just a sweet transvestite
From Transsexual...
... Transylvania
Let me show you around
Maybe play you a sound
You look like you're both
Pretty groovy
Or if you want something visual
That's not too abysmal
We could take in an old
Steve Reeves movie
I'm glad we caught you at home
Could we use your phone?
- We're both in a bit of a hurry
- Right
We'll just say where we are
- Then go back to the car
- A pleasure to meet you, Dr. Furter
We don't want to be any worry
Well, you got caught with a flat
Well, how about that
Well, babies, don't you panic
By the light of the night
It'll all seem all right
I'll get you a satanic mechanic
I'm just a sweet transvestite
From Transsexual...
... Transylvania
Why don't you stay for the night
- Night
- Or maybe a bite
Bite
I could show you
My favorite obsession
I've been making a man
With blond hair and a tan
And he's good for relieving
My tension
I'm just a sweet transvestite
From Transsexual...
... Transylvania
Hit it! Hit it!
- I'm just a sweet transvestite
- Sweet transvestite
From Transsexual...
... Transylvania
So come up to the lab
And see what's on the slab
I see you shiver
With antici...
- pation
But maybe the rain
Is really to blame
So I'll remove the cause
But not the symptom
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Brad!
We'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
Slowly, slowly.
It's too nice a job to rush.
Hi. My name's Brad Majors and this is my fiancée, Janet Weiss.
You are...?
You are very lucky to be invited up to Frank's laboratory.
Some people would give their right arm for the privilege.
People like you, maybe?
I've seen it.
Come along. The master doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Shift it!
Is he...? Frank, I mean, is he your husband?
The master is not yet married.
Nor do I think he ever will be.
- We are simply his servants.
- Oh.
Magenta.
Columbia.
Go and assist Riff Raff.
I will entertain...
Brad Majors and this is my fiancée, Janet Vice.
- Weiss.
- Weiss?
Enchantê.
Well, how nice.
And what charming underclothes you both have.
But here, put these on.
They'll make you feel less vulnerable.
It's not often we receive visitors here.
Let alone offer them hospitality.
Hospitality! All we wanted to do was use your telephone. Goddamn it!
A reasonable request you have ignored!
- Don't be ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?!
How forceful you are, Brad.
Such a perfect specimen of manhood.
So dominant.
You must be awfully proud of him, Janet.
Well, yes, I am.
- Do you have any tattoos, Brad?
- Certainly not.
Oh, well. How about you?
Everything is in readiness, master.
We merely await your word.
Tonight, my unconventional conventionists...
...you are to witness a new breakthrough...
...in biochemical research.
And paradise is to be mine!
It was strange the way it happened.
Suddenly...
...you get a break.
All the pieces seem to fit into place.
What a sucker you've been.
What a fool.
The answer was there all the time.
It took a small accident to make it happen.
- An accident!
- An accident!
That's how I discovered the secret.
That elusive ingredient.
That spark...
...that is the breath of life.
Yes.
I have that knowledge.
I hold the secret...
...to life itself!
You see...
...you are fortunate.
For tonight is the night...
...that my beautiful creature is destined to be born.
Throw open the switches on the sonic oscillator.
And step up the reactor power input...
...three more points!
Oh, Brad!
It's all right, Janet.
Oh, Rocky!
The sword of Damocles
Is hanging over my head
I've got the feeling someone's
Gonna be cutting the thread
Oh, woe is me
My life is a misery
Oh, can't you see
That I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer
I woke up this morning with a start
When I fell out of bed
That ain't no crime
And left from my dreaming
Was a feeling of unnameable dread
That ain't no crime
My high is low
I'm dressed up with no place to go
And all I know
Is I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer
- That ain't no crime.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- That ain't no crime.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Oh, my baby!
The sword of Damocles
Is hanging over my head
That ain't no crime
I've got the feeling someone's
Gonna be cutting the thread
That ain't no crime
Oh, woe is me
My life is a mystery
And can't you see
That I'm at the start
Of a pretty big downer
- That ain't no crime.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That ain't no crime
Well, really!
That's no way to behave on your first day out.
But since you're such an exceptional beauty...
...I'm prepared to forgive you.
Oh, I just love success!
- He is a credit to your genius.
- Yes.
- A triumph of your will.
- Yes.
He's okay.
Okay?
Okay?!
I think we can do better than that.
Now, Brad and Janet...
...what do you think of him?
Well...
I don't like men with too many muscles.
I didn't make him for you!
He carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval.
A weakling weighing 98 pounds
Will get sand in his face
When kicked to the ground
And soon in the gym
With a determined chin
The sweat from his pores
As he works for his cause
Will make him glisten
And gleam
And with massage
And just a little bit of steam
He'll be pink
And quite clean
He'll be a strong man
Oh, honey
But the wrong man
He'll eat nutritious high protein
And swallow raw eggs
Try to build up his shoulders
His chest, arms and legs
Such an effort
If he only knew of my plan
In just seven days
I can make you a man
He'll do press-ups and chin-ups
Do the snatch, clean and jerk
He thinks dynamic tension
Must be hard work
Such strenuous living
I just don't understand
When in just seven days
Oh, baby
I can make you a man
Eddie!
Whatever happened to Saturday night
When you dressed sharp, felt all right
Don't seem the same since cosmic light
Came into my life
I thought I was divine
I'd go for a ride with chicks who'd go
And listen to the music on the radio
A saxophone was blowing
On a rock 'n' roll show
We climbed in the back seat
We really had a good time
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock 'n' roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock 'n' roll
Lovely party!
My head used to swim
From the perfume I smelled
My hands kind of fumbled
With her white plastic belt
I'd taste her baby pink lipstick
And that's when I'd melt
She'd whisper in my ear
Tonight she really was mine
Get in front and put some hair oil on
Buddy Holly was singing his last song
With your arms around your girl
You tried to sing along
It felt pretty good
Really had a good time
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock 'n' roll
Hot patootie, bless my soul
I really love that rock 'n' roll
One from the vaults.
Oh, baby!
Don't be upset.
It was a mercy killing.
He had a certain naive charm...
...but no muscle.
But a deltoid
And a bicep
A hot groin
And a tricep
Makes me...
... shake
Makes me want to take Charles Atlas
By the hand
In just seven days
Oh, baby
I can make you a man
I don't want no dissension
Just dynamic tension
I'm a muscle fan
In just seven days
I can make you a man
Dig it if you can
In just seven days
I can make you a man
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!
There are those who say that life is an illusion...
...and that reality is simply a figment of the imagination.
If this is so, then Brad and Janet are quite safe.
However, the sudden departure of their host...
...and his creation...
...into the seclusion of his somber bridal suite...
...had left them feeling both apprehensive and uneasy.
A feeling which grew as the other guests departed...
...and they were shown to their separate rooms.
Who is it? Who's there?
It's only me, Janet.
Brad, darling, come in.
Oh, Brad!
Yes, my darling! But what if...?
Everything's going to be all right.
Oh, I hope so, my darling.
- It's you!
- I'm afraid so. But isn't it nice?
You beast, you monster!
What have you done with Brad?
Well, nothing.
Why, do you think I should?
You tricked me! I wouldn't have.
I've never, never...
Yes. Yes, I know.
But it isn't all bad, is it?
I think you'll really find it quite pleasurable.
- So soft, so sensual.
- Stop! I mean, help!
Brad. Oh, Brad!
Brad's probably asleep by now.
Do you want him to see you like this?
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame!
I was saving myself.
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
Promise you won't tell Brad?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Oh, Brad, darling, it's no good here!
It'll destroy us.
Don't worry. We'll be away from here in the morning.
Oh, Brad, you're so strong and protective.
You!
I'm afraid so, Brad.
But isn't it nice?
Why you...
What have you done with Janet?
Nothing. Why, do you think I should?
You tricked me. I wouldn't have.
I've never, never, never!
Yes, I know.
But it isn't all bad, is it?
Not even half bad.
I think you'll really quite enjoy it.
- So soft. So sensual.
- No, stop.
Oh, Janet.
Janet!
Janet's probably asleep by now.
Do you want her to see you like this?
Like this, like how? It's your fault!
You're to blame.
I thought it was the real thing!
Oh, come on, Brad, admit it.
You liked it, didn't you?
There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
Oh, Brad, you have wasted so much time already.
Janet needn't know. I won't tell her.
You promise you won't tell?
On my mother's grave.
Master, Rocky has broken his chains
and vanished.
The new playmate is loose
and somewhere in the castle grounds.
Magenta has just released the dogs.
Coming!
What's happening here? Where's Brad?
Where's anybody?
Oh, Brad!
Brad, my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Oh, If only we hadn't made this journey.
If only the car hadn't broken down.
If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
Oh, Brad.
What have they done with him?
Brad, how could you?
But you're hurt.
Did they do this to you?
Here. I'll dress your wounds.
Baby, there. Oh.
"Emotion: Agitation or disturbance
of mind...
...vehement or excited mental state."
It is also a powerful and irrational master.
And from what Magenta and Columbia eagerly viewed on their TV monitor...
... there seemed little doubt
that Janet was indeed...
... its slave.
Tell us about it, Janet.
I was feeling done in
Couldn't win
I'd only ever kissed before
You mean she...?
I thought there's no use getting
Into heavy petting
It only leads to trouble
And seat wetting
Now all I want to know
Is how to go
I've tasted blood and I want more
More, more, more.
I'll put up no resistance
I want to stay the distance
I've got an itch to scratch
I need assistance
Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me
I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night
Then if anything grows
While you pose
I'll oil you up and rub you down
Down, down, down.
And that's just one small fraction
Of the main attraction
You need a friendly hand
Oh, and I need action
Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me
I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night
Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me
I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night
Touch-a, touch-a, touch-a, touch me
I wanna be dirty
Thrill me, chill me, fulfill me
Creature of the night
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night?
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night
Creature of the night.
Creature of the night
Mercy!
How did it happen?
I understood you were to be watching.
I was only away for a minute, master.
Well, see if you can find him on the monitor.
Master.
Master, we have a visitor.
Hey, Scotty!
Dr. Everett Scott.
You know this earthling...
- this person?
I most certainly do. He happens to be an old friend of mine.
I see.
So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.
You came here with a purpose.
I told you, my car broke down.
I was telling the truth.
I know what you told me, Brad.
But this Dr. Everett Scott, his name is not unknown to me.
He was a science teacher at Denton High.
And now he works for your government.
He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation...
...of that which you call UFOs!
Isn't that right, Brad?
He might be. I don't know.
The intruder is entering the building, master.
He'll probably be in the Zen Room.
Shall we inquire of him in person?
Great Scott!
Frank N. Furter.
We meet at last.
Dr. Scott!
Brad! What are you doing here?
Don't play games, Dr. Scott.
You know perfectly well what Brad Majors is doing here.
It was part of your plan, was it not?
That he and his female should check the layout for you?
Well, unfortunately for you all, the plans are to be changed.
I hope you're adaptable, Dr. Scott.
I know Brad is.
I assure you, Brad's presence comes as a complete surprise to me.
I came here to find Eddie.
- Eddie? I've seen him. He's...
- Eddie?
What do you know of Eddie?
I know a great deal about a lot of things.
You see, Eddie happens to be my nephew.
Dr. Scott.
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!
- Janet!
- Brad!
Rocky!
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!
- Janet!
- Brad!
Rocky!
Listen! I made you...
...and I can break you just as easily.
Master, dinner is prepared!
Excellent.
Under the circumstances, formal dress is to be optional.
Food has always played a vital role in life's rituals:
The breaking of bread, the last meal of the condemned man...
...and now this meal.
However informal it might appear...
... you can be sure there was to be
very little bonhomie.
A toast.
To absent friends.
To absent friends.
And Rocky.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Rocky
- Happy birthday...
- Shall we?
We came here to discuss Eddie.
Eddie!
It's a rather tender subject.
Another slice, anyone?
Excuse me.
I knew he was in with a bad crowd, but it was worse than I imagined.
Aliens!
Dr. Scott!
Go on, Dr. Scott.
Or should I say Dr. Von Scott?
Just what exactly are you implying?
It's all right!
That's all right, Brad.
From the day he was born
He was trouble
He was the thorn
In his mother's side
She tried in vain
But he never caused her
Nothing but shame
He left home...
... the day she died
From the day she was gone
All he wanted
Was rock 'n' roll porn
Und a motorbike
Shooting up junk
He was a low-down, cheap little punk
Taking everyone for a ride
When Eddie said
He didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no-good kid
But when he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife
- What a guy
- Makes you cry
Und I did
Everybody shoved him
I very nearly loved him
I said, hey, listen to me
Stay sane inside insanity
But he locked the door
And threw away the key
But he must've been drawn
Into something
Making him warn me
In a note which reads:
What's it say? What's it say?
"I'm out of my head
Oh, hurry, or I may be dead
They mustn't carry out
Their evil deeds"
When Eddie said
He didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no-good kid
When he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife
- What a guy
- Makes you cry
Und I did
When Eddie said
He didn't like his teddy
You knew he was a no-good kid
But when he threatened your life
With a switchblade knife
- What a guy
- Woe, woe, woe
- Makes you cry
- Hey, hey, hey
Und I did
Hey
Oh.
Oh, Rocky!
How could you?!
This way! This way!
Shut up!
I'll tell you once
I won't tell you twice
You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss
Your apple pie
Don't taste too nice
You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss
I've laid the seed
It should be all you need
You're as sensual as a pencil
Wound up like an E or first string
When we made it
Did ya hear a bell ring?
You got a block
Well, take my advice
You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss
The transducer
Will seduce ya
My feet! I can't move my feet!
My wheels!
My God, I can't move my wheels.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
You are.
So quake with fear, you tiny fools.
We're trapped.
It's something you'll get used to
A mental mind fuck can be nice
No!
You won't find Earth people the easy mark you imagine.
This sonic transducer...
...it is some kind of audio-vibratory, physiomolecular transport device?
- You mean...?
- Yes, Brad.
It's something we ourselves have been working on for a while.
But it seems our friend here has found a means of perfecting it.
A device capable of breaking down solid matter...
...and then projecting it through space, and who knows...
...perhaps even time itself!
He's gonna send us to another planet?
Planet schmanet, Janet.
You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss
You'd better wise up
Build your thighs up
You'd better wise up
And then she cried out:
Stop!
Don't get hot and flustered
Use a bit of mustard
You're a hot dog
But you'd better not...
... try to hurt her
Frank Furter
You're a hot dog
But you'd better not...
... try to hurt her
Frank Furter
You're a hot dog
My God! I can't stand any more of this.
First, you spurn me for Eddie, then you toss him like an old coat for Rocky.
You chew people up and then you spit them out again.
I loved you.
Do you hear me? I loved you.
And what did it get me?
I'll tell you, a big nothing.
You're like a sponge. You drain others of their love and emotion.
Well, I've had enough!
Choose between me and Rocky, so named because of the rocks in his head.
It's not easy, having a good time.
Even smiling makes my face ache.
And my children turn on me.
Rocky's behaving just the way that Eddie did.
Maybe I made a mistake...
...splitting his brain between the two of them.
I grow weary of this world!
When shall we return to Transylvania?!
Magenta...
...I am indeed grateful to both you and your brother, Riff Raff.
You have both served me well.
Loyalty such as yours shall not go unrewarded.
You'll discover that when the mood takes me, I can be quite generous.
I ask for nothing, master.
And you shall receive it in abundance!
Come. We are ready for the floorshow.
And so, by some extraordinary
coincidence...
...fate, it seemed, had decided that Brad and Janet...
...should keep that appointment with their friend Dr. Everett Scott.
But it was to be in a situation...
...which none of them could have possibly foreseen.
And just a few hours after announcing their engagement...
...Brad and Janet had both tasted...
...forbidden fruit.
This in itself was proof...
...that their host was a man of little morals...
...and some persuasion.
What further indignities were they to be subjected to?
And what of the floorshow that had been spoken of?
In an empty house...
...in the middle of the night?
What diabolical plan...
...had seized
Frank's crazed imagination?
What indeed?
From what had gone before, it was clear...
...that this was to be no picnic.
It was great when it all began
I was a regular Frankie fan
But it was over when he had the plan
To start working on a muscleman
Now the only thing that gives me hope
Is my love of a certain dope
Rose tints my world
Keeps me safe
From my trouble and pain
I'm just seven hours old
Truly beautiful to behold
And somebody should be told
My libido hasn't been controlled
Now the only thing I've come to trust
Is an orgasmic rush of lust
Rose tints my world
And keeps me safe
From my trouble and pain
It's beyond me
Help me, Mommy
I'll be good, you'll see
Take this dream away
What's this
Let's see
I feel sexy
What's come over me
Here it comes again
I feel released
Bad times deceased
My confidence has increased
Reality is here
The game has been disbanded
My mind has been expanded
It's a gas that Frankie's landed
His lust is so sincere
Whatever happened...
... to Fay Wray
That delicate...
... satin-draped frame
As it clung to her thigh
How I started to cry
'Cause I wanted to be dressed
Just the same
Give yourself over
To absolute pleasure
Swim the warm waters
Of sins of the flesh
Erotic nightmares
Beyond any measure
And sensual daydreams
To treasure forever
Can't you just see it
Don't dream it
Be it
Don't dream it
Be it
Don't dream it
Be it
Don't dream it
Be it
We've got to get...
...out of this trap...
...before this decadence...
...saps our wills.
I've got to be strong...
...und try to hang on.
Or else my mind...
...may well snap.
Und my life will be lived...
... for the thrill
It's beyond me
Help me, Mommy
God bless...
... Lily St. Cyr
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
I'm a wild and untamed thing
I'm a bee with a deadly sting
Get a hit and your mind goes "ping"
Your heart'll thump
And your blood will sing
Let the party and the sounds rock on
We're gonna shake it
Till the life has gone
Rose tints my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain
We're a wild and an untamed thing
We're a bee with a deadly sting
Get a hit and your mind goes "ping"
Your heart'll thump
And your blood will sing
So let the party
And the sounds rock on
We're gonna shake it
Till the life has gone
Rose tints my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain
We're a wild and an untamed thing
We're a bee with a deadly sting
Get a hit and your mind goes "ping"
Your heart'll thump
And your blood will sing
So let the party
And the sounds rock on
We're gonna shake it
Till the life has gone
Rose tints my world
Keep me safe from my trouble and pain
Frank N. Furter
It's all over
Your mission is a failure
Your lifestyle's too extreme
I'm your new commander
You now are my prisoner
We return to Transylvania
Prepare the transit beam
Wait!
I can explain.
On the day I went away
Goodbye
Was all I had to say
Now I
I want to come again and stay
Oh, my, my
Smile and that will mean I may
'Cause I've seen
Blue skies through the tears
In my eyes
And I realize
I'm going home
I'm going home
Everywhere it's been the same
Feeling
Like I'm outside in the rain
Wheeling
Free to try and find a game
Dealing
Cards for sorrow
Cards for pain
'Cause I've seen
Blue skies
Through the tears
In my eyes
And I realize
That I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
How sentimental.
And also presumptuous of you.
You see, when I said "we"...
...were to return to Transylvania...
...I referred only to Magenta and myself.
I'm sorry, however, if you found my words misleading...
...but you see...
...you are to remain here.
In spirit anyway.
Good heavens, that's a laser.
Yes, Dr. Scott.
A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
You're going to kill him?
- What's his crime?
- You saw what became of Eddie.
Society must be protected.
Exactly, Dr. Scott.
Now, Frank N. Furter, your time has come
Say goodbye to all of this...
...and hello to oblivion.
No.
No.
No!
Good God!
You killed them.
But I thought you liked them.
They liked you.
They didn't like me!
They never liked me!
You did right.
A decision had to be made.
You're okay by me.
Dr. Scott...
...I'm sorry about your nephew.
Eddie?
Yes, well, perhaps it was for the best.
You should leave now, Dr. Scott, while it is still possible.
We are about to beam the entire house...
...back to the planet of Transsexual...
...in the galaxy of Transylvania.
Go.
Now.
Our noble mission is almost completed...
...my most beautiful sister.
And soon we shall return to the moon-drenched shores...
...of our beloved planet.
Sweet Transsexual.
Land of night.
To sing and dance once more to your dark refrain.
To take that...
...step to the right.
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane
And our world...
...will do the time warp again!
I've done a lot
God knows I've tried
To find the truth
I've even lied
But all I know
Is down inside
I'm bleeding
And superheroes
Come to feast
To taste the flesh
Not yet deceased
And all I know
Is still the beast
Is feeding
And crawling
On the planet's face
Some insects
Called the human race
Lost in time
And lost in space
And meaning

Fellow taxpayers and stockholders in America, on the first Tuesday in November... we have to make some vital decisions about our management.
Let me go directly to the point.
I'm for doing some replacing.
I've discussed the Replacement Party... with people all over this country, and I'm often confronted with the statement:
"I don't want to get mixed up in politics," or "I'm tired of politics," or "I'm not interested."
Almost as often someone says, "I can't do anything about it anyway."
Let me point out two things.
Number one: All of us are deeply involved with politics, whether we know it or not and whether we like it or not.
And number two:
We can do something about it.
When you pay more for an automobile... than it cost Columbus to make his first voyage to America, that's politics.
My mother's people came by ship
And fought at Bunker Hill
My daddy lost a leg in France
I have his medals still
My brother served with Patton
I saw action in Algiers
Oh, we must be doin' somethin'right
To last
200 years
- I pray my sons won't go to war
- Oooh
But if they must, they must
I share our country's motto
And in God
I place my trust
We may have had our ups and downs
- Our times of trials and fears
- Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh
But we must be doin' somethin' right
To last
200 years
We must be doin' somethin' right
To last
200 years
I've lived through two depressions
And seven dust bowl droughts
Floods, locusts and tornadoes
But I don't have any doubts
We're all a part of history
Why, Old Glory waves to show
How far we've come along till now
How far we've got to go
How far we've got to go
It's been hard work
But every time we get into a fix
Let's think of what our children face
In 2-aught-7-6
It's up to us to pave the way
With our blood and sweat and tears
Oh, we must be doin' somethin' right
To last
200 years
We must be doin'somethin'right
To last 200 years
We must be doin' somethin' right
To last
Years
Years
200 years
- That girl down there.
- Hold it! Hold it, everybody.
Honey, you gotta get her out.
- Bob.
- Yes, sir.
I want to talk to Buddy.
Buddy!
Y- Yes, sir, Dad?
Buddy, who is that woman in there with the hat on?
- She a friend of yours?
- I'm Opal. Mr. Hamilton, I'm Opal.
I'm from the BBC, and I'm doing a documentary on Nashville.
Buddy, you know I don't allow no people visitin' when I'm recordin'.
I want no recording equipment in that studio.
Escort the lady out.
If she wants a copy of this record, she can buy it when it's released.
I'm sorry.
Just no strangers at all.
Mr. Hamilton,
I'll be waiting outside for you.
We'll have a little interview.
I wanna do another one.
Jimmy, you count off.
I wanna hear a little more Haven in this one.
There we are.
This is Studio B right here.
- I think they're doing some gospel.
- Oh, how sweet!
A recording of some sort.
Hey, Glenn. How are you?
- Mind if we sit in?
- Come on in.
It's so little!
We'll be going down front so we'll get out of the way.
I've been through all the recording studios in London.
They're always enormous and very impersonal.
This is so cozy.
Keep down so they can see what's going on.
There we are.
Good Lord love a duck!
This is a choir... a black choir... from, uh, part of... from Fisk University here in town.
Good Lord!
- The lady singing is...
- Is she a missionary?
No, she's not.
She's a gospel singer.
She's the wife of our attorney.
I was making a documentary in Kenya... and there was this marvelous woman who was a missionary.
That's why I asked if she was a missionary. She was sensational.
She was converting Kukuyos by the dozens.
She was trying to convert Masais.
Of course, they were hopeless.
They have their own sort of religion.
- Do you believe in Jesus
- Yes, I do
- Do you believe in Jesus
- Yes, I do
- Do you believe in Jesus
- Yes, I do
Do you believe that Jesus knows what's in your soul
Do you thank the Lord every chance you get
For He sent His son to save all good men
Yes, I do
- O Lord
- Yes, I do
- O Lord
- Yes, I do
Yes, I do
Yes, I do
Look at that.
That rhythm is fantastic.
- Do you believe in Jesus
- Yes, I do
It's funny... You can tell it's come down in the genes... through ages and ages and hundreds of years, but it's there.
I mean, take off those robes and one is in... in... in darkest Africa.
I can just see their naked, frenzied bodies... dancing to the beat of...
Do they carry on like that in church?
Depends on which church you go to.
- Yes, I do
- Yeah-eah-eah
- Yes, I do
- Ohhh, Lord
- Yes, I do
- Yeah-eah-eah
- Yes, I do, Yes, I do
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
- Ohhh-ohh-ohh
- Yes, I do, Oh, Lord
I've lived through two depressions
And seven dust bowl droughts
Floods, locusts and tornadoes
But I don't have any doubts
We're all a part of history
Why, Old Glory waves to show
How far...
- Hold it. Hold it!
- How far...
Hold it, everybody.
Damn it, Bob.
What's the name of the piano player, Bob?
- That's Frog.
- That's Frog. He plays like a frog.
We'll try it again.

Must be doin'somethin'right to last
- Damn it to hell!
- Hold it, everybody.
- Bob.
- Yes, sir?
What did you say the piano player's name was?
- Frog.
- Yeah.
When I ask for Pig,
I want Pig.
Now, you get me Pig, and then we'll be ready to record this here tune.
Yes, sir.
You get your hair cut.
You don't belong in Nashville.
This is Bill Jenkins on special assignment for Channel Two News.
Here at Metro Airport we're awaiting the arrival of Barbara Jean, who has been away for treatment at the Baltimore Burn Center.
Already, prior to her arrival, around 3,000 Barbara Jean fans and supporters are here at the airport.
They are being held inside the terminal by security police.
Ma'am, excuse me.
Am I late for Barbara Jean's plane?
- I don't think so.
- Thank you, ma'am.
Members of the Chamber of Commerce and other fans are on the way.
Also, Haven Hamilton will make an appearance here at Metro Airport.
There is no question about being involved.
The question is,
What to do?
It is the very nature of government... to strain at a gnat and swallow a camel.
As loyal citizens, we accept our take-home pay, understand most of the deductions... and even, to a degree, come to expect them.
However, when the government begins to force its citizens... to swallow a camel, it's time to pause and do some accounting.
Her plane has touched down and will be turning onto the ramp area... directly here in front of us at Metro Airport.
Could you pass me the crackers, please?
- There you go.
- Thank you.
- Miss, may I have...
- Hi!
A... a caramel sundae, please?
Honey, we ain't got no caramel sundae.
- Butterscotch?
- Ain't got no butterscotch sundae.
- Oh.
- Got a strawberry.
- Strawberries are always in season.
- Fine, fine.
- That's fine. Thank you.
- Good for you too.
Thank you. Then I'll have a strawberry sundae, if I may.
- You got it.
- Thank you.
- Sueleen, did you see what he did?
- One strawberry sundae!
Sueleen, did you see what he just did?
He took the thing off the salt and threw it up in the air.
Why'd you do that?
What are you doin' in Nashville?
- Oh, I live here.
- You do?
Hey, fellas, come here.
I want you to see somethin'.
My wife and I...
My wife is sick, unfortunately.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
It's just one of those things that happens.
- Happens in the best of families.
- Yeah.
I wrote me this real hot song.
You wanna hear it?
It's called
"I Never Get Enough."
Okay, listen.
All right?
I never get enough
I never get enough
Of the love
I'm hungry for
I never get enough
I never get enough
I always want more and more
Even...
If we stay together
Our whole lifetime through
I'll never get enough
I'll never get enough
I'll never get enough of you
At any moment Barbara Jean will be stepping out and will be greeted... by the Chamber of Commerce, as well as Mr. Sperry.
Mr. Sperry making his way to the aircraft right now with a big wave.
Of course, he's the president of Barnett Enterprises.
- We'll be talking with Mr. Sperry...
- Hey!
John Triplette?
- I'm John Triplette.
- Oh!
- How are you?
- Hey, John. How are you?
Those kids in those uniforms are terrific.
- Hello.
- What's your name?
- Del Reese. I'm sorry. Forgive me.
- Thanks for coming out.
- It's a great idea.
- You mean the girls in the costumes.
Barbara Jean's still on the aircraft.
We'll be awaiting her.
Thousands of people have turned out to greet Barbara Jean... after her arrival.
Now Haven Hamilton has just arrived, typically dressed in white.
His white Jeep being driven today by his son Bud.
Members of the Chamber of Commerce are going over to Haven Hamilton.
He's greeting some of his old friends, business acquaintances.
Autograph seekers are now making their way over.
Barbara Jean still is aboard the aircraft.
- Hello, Martha.
- Hi.
- How are you, Martha?
- I'm okay, but, uh...
- Pardon me?
- Listen, uh, I changed my name.
- Oh?
- It's L.A. Joan from now on.
Let me get some cigarettes.
Your Aunt Esther wants to see you.
- She's in the hospital.
- Wait a minute.
This guy's a rock star.
Can I get your autograph?
You're Tom, aren't ya?
Tom, Bill and Mary?
Jesus, you oughta stop that diet before you ruin yourself.
Do you believe this? They have our album here. Hey, how's it selling?
- What's that?
- Bill, Mary and Tom.
A little slow, but we sell mostly country.
I'm the handsome one in the front.
I don't have my glasses on, but I...
Wait a minute! Hal Phillip Walker looks exactly like Connie White.
Now, Del, I like...
I like the idea of bands.
I want you to listen to those little kids, honey.
They practiced every day for two hours for a whole month... just for this event.
- That's so nice.
- Isn't that cute?
- I think they're adorable.
- Pearl, shut up.
- Just like your mama, son!
- Yes, yes, I'm sure he is.
Barbara Jean, tragically burned in an accident involving a fire baton.
She has now fully recovered, however required to take...
- Excuse me, Barnett...
- I got no time right now!
Jesus!
I just think they're so cute,
Buddy.
Testing...
I wonder if this thing's on.
Hey... Hey, are you Tom of Bill, Mary and Tom?
- Yeah. What's your name?
- Jamie.
You thought of voting for Walker for president?
- I don't vote for nobody.
- Oh, come on.
Just read it.
He's got a fantastic platform.
How you doin', Sarge?
You kill anybody this week?
So beautiful.
Did you ever see such pretty girls in your life?
Someday you're gonna be big girls like your mommies, and you're gonna be lookin'for a nice, young, handsome man...
Come on, Buddy, say hello.
My son Buddy, he just graduated from Harvard Law School... and we're tryin' to give him all the breaks we never got.
- Buddy, say hello to the people.
- Hi.
Thank you, Buddy.
And thank you again for comin'here and makin'us all feel so at home.
Here she comes!
Here she comes!
Our Barbara Jean!
Get up here.
Get on the other side.
Here's our own Barbara Jean!
May I have a word,
Barnett?
Not here.
Come on. Come on.
Who do you think you are?
Marlon Brando?
Barbara Jean, ladies and gentlemen!
- Hi!
- Oh, look at that!
Is that a sight!
Hello, Haven darling.
Hi, Bill. Hi, Mary.
Where's Tom?
- Can you take my bag?
- Sure.
- The gate.
- Then let's go meet at the gate.
- Norman, let's go to the limo.
- The limo is just outside.
Barbara Jean, for you.
- Thank you, Haven.
- Right here for the photographer.
Thank you, Tennessee Twirlers, for coming out today, and thank you,
Franklin High School Band.
I think you kids get better every year.
Twirlers, let's twirl!
Oh, little beauty!
Thank you so much!
Are you gonna ride into town with me or not?
Go on without me. I'm gonna wait,
'cause I think she's gonna sing.
Who, her?
She ain't gonna sing.
She don't sing unless she gets paid.
I'd like to thank you for coming out to greet me today.
It's great to be home.
It's as hot as a firecracker.
What's so funny about that?
Me and the boys are gonna be out at the Opry this week, and like my grandaddy always used to say, if you're down to the river
I hope you'll drop in.
Ohh! Yes, that's sweet.
Who writes your material, darlin'?
Barnett, who are all those people inside there?
That's just airport security,
'cause of all the hijackers.
- Did they come to see me?
- They can see you pretty good.
Then I'd like to go in and say hello.
Aww, that's so sweet!
Barnett,
I'm sorry, darlin'.
This is a little bit unscheduled.
She's on her way to greet some of the fans that are inside there.
- Stepping on down with Barnett.
- Watch out for the water.
That was real nice.
Right behind, Haven Hamilton and all the other friends, members and, uh...
She's fallen!
Harold, come on!
She's fallen somewhere down there!
If we can get down there...
Don't know how far we can make it.
Who do you think is running Congress?
Farmers? Engineers?
Teachers? Businessmen?
No, my friends,
Congress is run by lawyers.
A lawyer is trained for two things and two things only:
To clarify... that's one... and to confuse... that's the other thing.
He does whichever is to his client's advantage.
You ever ask a lawyer the time of day?
He told you how to make a watch, didn't he?
Ever ask a lawyer how to get to
Mr. Jones'house in the country?
You got lost, didn't you?
Congress is composed of 535 individuals.
Two hundred and eighty-eight are lawyers.
And you wonder what's wrong in Congress.
No wonder we often know how to make a watch, but we don't know the time of day.
No wonder it takes 6 or 7 years...
What the hell is the matter with you?
Yes, I'm talking about replacement... replacing this lawyeristic, red-taped... and blank-taped government... with the yes-and-no language of farmers and teachers, engineers and businessmen.
I'm not pessimistic about this country.
She finally collapsed here on the sidewalk. Sort of a faint.
That's all we've been able to determine at this moment.
We interviewed Mr. Sperry.
He said the same thing.
Haven Hamilton said the same thing as well.
That's about it for the moment from Metro Airport.
For Channel Two News, this is Bill Jenkins reporting.
Let's consider our national anthem.
Nobody knows the words.
Nobody can sing it.
Nobody understands it.
I suppose all the lawyers supported it... because a lawyer wrote the words and a judge wrote the tune.
Careful, Buddy.
- Read it through carefully.
- Watch out for that truck.
And I say read it because I know you can't sing it.
Read all four verses and you'll understand what I'm talking about.
Yes, sir, I would support work and vote for replacement.
Change our national anthem...
- This is terrific, Norman.
- To something people understand, back to something that would make a light shine in their faces.
Hey, man, get off my car!
Don't lean on my car!
I just got this goddamn thing fixed, so don't lean on it now.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh, God.
Hey, man, get the hell off my car!
You almost made me fall!
Okay, thanks.
You got one too?
Thanks a lot. Just keep those cards and letters comin' in, folks.
- I cannot. I feel faint.
- I'm gonna get us a Popsicle.
- H-Hello!
- Those mangled bodies.
Would you go to that Popsicle truck and get us a couple of sweet ices?
There must be 20 cars piled up, one on top of the other.
- Oh, now, come on.
- I saw a leg sticking out.
This is gonna be a mess.
I don't know how long it, uh...
Can you just pull on through where the ambulance went through?
You wanna come on in and try it?
- What's the matter, son?
- I'm stalled.
- What did you want? Popsicle?
- I wish my cameraman had been here.
He's never around. I need something like this for my documentary.
I need it.
It's... It's America.
Those cars smashing into each other... and all those mangled corpses...
Just a minute now.
Just a minute.
Aren't there any rock stations?
Well, hard to really say.
You see, after they opened her up... they figured they oughta do an exploratory.
You know, give her kind of an overhaul.
- Twenty dollars?
- Twenty dollars.
- I'll give you five.
- No, I'll take 15.
You'll take 15?
I'll give you ten.
I can think of no sensible reason why New York... must of necessity have
12,000 major crimes committed... for every 1,000 committed in Tokyo.
- Yet these are the true victims.
- Excuse me.
Some very funny notions have developed in American politics.
Let me see.
Um, have you any children?
Yes, I have two children.
I have a boy and a girl.
Oh, isn't that nice.
How old are they?
Twelve and eleven.
Do they want to be singers like their mummy?
Uh, well, my children are deaf.
They're... They are deaf.
They were born deaf.
Oh, my God, how awful.
- It's so depressing.
- Now, just a minute. That's not so.
- I wish you could see my boy.
- Oh, I couldn't.
He has the most incredible personality.
It's the sadness of it.
See, what happened is, he made a million dollars on a fly swatter, because it had a red dot in the center.
- Fly swatter?
- That's right. Just a red dot.
He was sittin' in the buffet, he was eatin', and he saw a woman... and she was swattin' flies.
And, uh, she...
Uh, he said,
"What makes the difference in fly swatters?"
'Cause it has to do with the industrial revolution.
The thing with these country people is, they have a real grassroots appeal.
Oh, hell, they got fans.
And they're the people that elect the president.
We're gonna do everything we can.
You line up a lot of movie stars...
People here feel that movie stars are eccentric and crazy.
- Communists.
- Well...
- A lot of'em are.
- It's been said.
- I want to go to the Grand Ole Opry.
- Forget that.
- 'Cause I have to have my record...
- I don't like music.
- I'm gonna go see what's goin' on.
- I have a gold record.
- It needs to be signed.
- Get away from my truck!
- Goddamn it. Sons of bitches.
- Shit.
I say, could I please speak to Mr. Tommy Brown?
I'm sorry. What?
Is it possible to have a few words with Mr. Tommy Brown?
I'm from the BBC. I'm doing a documentary on Nashville.
What is the BBC?
- British Broadcasting Company.
- Oh, English.
It was called
"Wanda, Wander."
No, that song was called
"Wonder, Wanda."
- Wanda, wander's got me bad
- I don't have a pen.
- No... Wonder, Wanda's got me bad
- I keep travelin'
And I'm sad
Buddy, Buddy, which was it?
- I don't really know.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Goddamn it, it was "Wanda, Wander."
- It was "Wonder, Wanda."
- "Wanda, Wander"! "Wanda, Wander"!
- "Wonder, Wanda."
What difference does it make?
It was a hit!
There's no breathing space.
What we need, first and foremost, is a common-sense approach.
Nothing complicated.
Is Mr. Brown going to...
Will he be here soon?
Yeah, he's in the back changin'.
Whenever he's going to have an interview, he puts his makeup on... and likes to get all prettied up.
That's nice.
He must be a marvelous person... to have all you lovely people working for him.
I know the problems in the South.
I mean, I've heard of them.
Well, yeah.
- He's a very liberal guy.
- Oh, that's lovely.
By the way, I'd like for you to meet his wife. This is Joy.
- Mrs. Brown?
- Yes.
You may say that I ain't free
But it don't worry me
No, it don't
Today in America, with its unmatched resources, it is exceedingly ridiculous, a total absurdity... that any citizen with any ailment, mental or physical, should go medically unattended.
We're settin' up everything for you.
- We got pictures the right height.
- Oh, yeah, the bird again.
Isn't that beautiful.
I remember when you gave that to me.
I remember I almost threw it out.
Good afternoon, girls.
I'd like you to wait outside the room a while... because I know Aunt Esther would like to fix herself up a little.
I want my dog.
Where is my dog?
- I'm sorry. I've got a date.
- You do?
- I just need one shot.
- I'm sorry. Could you excuse us?
- Come right on in, sir.
- How you doin', Howard?
I'm sorry.
No press allowed.
- Put these pictures above your head.
- Fine, Buddy.
- Delbert, I got no time.
- I know, I know.
I just stopped by to see Barbara Jean.
How you doin'?
How's lawyerin'?
Nobody pays me no mind.
I'm just like another flunky.
- Would you mind crankin' me up?
- More white carnations.
Bud, what are you doin'?
This is a hospital!
This ain't no construction site!
- I am not the press.
- Go build another chair!
Goddamn it.
I am not the press.
I am from the BBC.
Damned if I don't keep my pledge.
- Look who's here. Mr. Brown.
- Glad you're here, but cut it short.
How do you do?
Nice to see you.
You look as beautiful as a big black butterfly.
I'm gettin' jealous.
You better get outta here.
He's gettin'mighty jealous.
I gotta set myself up a bit. Hi.
- I need to talk to you.
- You got it.
All right, everybody.
Doctor's gotta talk turkey.
Barnett, there's somebody
I want you to meet.
- John Triplette from California.
- John Triple?
- Triplette.
- Okay. All right.
- Okay.
- He's a killer.
- Give us some good news.
- Excuse us, please.
- Are you a relative?
- No, no.
- Can you tell me how she is?
- She's fine.
It's her husband
I'm concerned about.
Now say somethin'good.
You got two seconds.
- Can I have a light?
- Excuse me?
- Can I have a light?
- Yeah, sure.
The incident you described just now is very similar... to what was diagnosed as some kind of intestinal disorder.
- What's your name?
- Bud Hamilton's my name.
It's really hot here.
Esther's awake.
She's dying to see you.
I'll be there in a minute.
I'm talking to someone right now.
- I'm talking to someone.
- I beg your pardon.
That's my uncle.
I've got a sick aunt down the hall.
I just got in from Los Angeles a few hours ago.
- I'm L.A. Joan.
- L.A. Joan?
What do you do?
Well, I know it sounds arrogant, but I'm on my way to town, if I ever make it, to become a country-western singer or star.
Yeah? What are you gonna do if you don't?
If I don't? I don't kn...
Oh, I could always go into sales.
- Like ladies' clothes?
- No... I don't know.
Well, I know all about trucks, so I'd go into trucking, I guess.
- You're kidding me.
- No, I'm not kiddin' you.
I'm in a truck enough. And I know how to fix motors and all that.
- Nobody'd buy trucks from a girl.
- I been fixin' motors a long time.
They'd buy 'em from me
'cause I know all about motors.
Why do you say that?
See, what's happenin' is, if I can't sell trucks and I can't go...
- Nobody'd buy a truck from a girl.
- I knew this was gonna happen.
Don't say you saw me.
Hey, you haven't seen my wife, have ya?
- She's sort of ordinary-lookin'.
- Uh-uh.
Are you going into town?
You're not one of them country singers, are ya?
- No. Can you give me a ride?
- All right, get in.
You look like a guy
I was in the navy with.
He wouldn't bathe, so we had to pee in his bed to get him discharged.
Hi.
My name's Sueleen Gay.
I'm here to sing you all a couple of songs tonight that I wrote.
I sure hope you're gonna enjoy 'em, honey,
'cause I know I'm gonna enjoy singin' 'em to ya.
The first one I'm gonna sing tonight is called...
"Let Me Be The One."
Let's go.
Oh, what about your... your aunt and uncle?
Oh, it's cool.
I can see them anytime.
- What kind of car you got?
- I have a little... Here.
Martha!
And, uh, that... that being true,
I would suggest, on the basis of the first account...
Mississippi
River
Keep on flowing
Push your muddy waters down to the sea
I'm so lonely
Rolling on this river
Old Man
Mississippi River
Carry me home
I got a cute little gal waitin'home for me
Down in
Memphis, Tennessee
Gonna see my girl
She's a Cajun queen
Waitin'down in New Orleans
How come you're not wearing the blue dress?
Because I didn't want to wear it.
You're supposed to wear the blue dress when I wear this.
- I don't wanna dress like twins.
- We're not twins. We're a trio.
Hi, young stud.
Come in, sit down right over here.
Yeah! Whoo.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to...
No, it's okay.
He looks like
Howdy Doody.
Okay, this is, uh...
Right here at Deemen's Den.
- Hi, everybody! My name's Sheila.
- And my name's Patti.
And we're the Smokey Mountain Laurel.
Oh, these troubled times
They been makin' me weary
All my toil and teardrops make me sa-a-a-ad
Oh, these troubled times
They been makin'me weary
Still, the Lord is the best friend I have
So I'm goin' down to the river
Where I'm gonna kiss my sins away
I'm goin' down to the river
I'm a-gonna begin a brand-new day
Sweet Jesus
He came in the morning
He didn't kiss no women at night
Come on, Becky, let's go.
It's gettin' late.
I've gotta get up...
Sorry.
Oh! Tom!
- Yeah?
- Tom, hello.
Another one of his girlfriends.
I was looking for you.
This chap told me you were in here.
- Who are you?
- I'm Opal from the BBC. Hello.
Good evening, ladies.
You don't mind if I sit down for a little bit.
All right, I wanna hear it some more for my Misty Mountain Boys!
I got a couple announcements
I wanna make.
We got some stars here tonight.
- It can't be us.
- And one of'em is...
Tommy Brown's back in town!
Tommy Brown!
Stand up and show it off!
Oh, ain't he beautiful!
Tommy Brown? Tommy Brown's the whitest nigger in town.
It's gettin' late.
I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry.
He oughta drink some of that milk!
It fits his personality!
This is not typical of Lady Pearl's parlors, you understand.
It's not typical of Nashville.
- I hope you'll tell the other ones.
- Hey, the Oreo cookie's leavin'!
Calm down.
You're drunk.
I know I'm drunk, but he's still the whitest nigger in town, and I ain't gonna change my mind about that, I'll tell you right now.
Tommy Brown. Shit.
Hey, where you goin', Tommy Brown?
Come on back in...
Hey, get your hands off...
Listen, boys!
I got two guns here!
Jesus said it's gonna be all
Right
Well, how'd we do, Trout?
Not bad, girls. Go sit down.
I'll talk to you in a minute.
Send over a couple of beers.
Hey, Bear, how about a couple beers for the ladies, huh?
- Okay, honey, what's your name?
- Sueleen. Sueleen Gay.
Sueleen Gay, you're on next.
Come on, Bunkie.
One, two, three, four.
Un, doux, trois, quatre.
Testing. Testing.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Wait for me here.
The kind of guys that go for this Hal Phillip Walker...
Longhairs that smoke cigarettes that look funny.
I heard this guy's an admitted homo.
Hi, y'all.
My name's Sueleen Gay... and I'm here to sing you all a couple songs that I wrote.
First one I'm gonna do is called "Let Me Be The One."
Let me be the one
To understand you
That's awful.
Let me be the one to lend a hand
And if you need some kind affection
- Won't you let me give you some
- What is this?
Won't you let me
Be the one
Oh, won't you
Let me be the one
Won't you let me be the one
When your skies get dark and cloudy
- Won't you let me be the sun
- I'm looking for Frog.
When you're feelin' kinda down
- And you wanna have some fun
- Um, I'm making a demo.
- You want a beer?
- No, thanks. This is business.
See, what I was wonderin'...
I'm makin' a demonstration album at a recordin' studio.
- And, uh...
- Winifred!
- What? You...
- Goddamn it, come back here!
- No!
- Everybody
- Winifred!
- Needs to give some too
When you get tired of pretending
- Deemen's Den.
- Is Trout around there?
- Yeah, this is Trout.
- Listen, this is, uh, Del Reese.
We're gonna have a fund-raiser,
And we need some help with some...
- Talent?
- Yeah, talent. Right.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
The fella I'm working with is here.
I'm gonna put him on the phone.
He can tell you what it is we need.
John Triplette's his name.
Uh, Trout.
This fella's name's Trout.
- Trout.
- Yeah.
- Hello, Trout?
- Hey, John, how are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Fantastic.
Listen, as Del told you, we're putting a smoker together.
I think next Monday night, hopefully.
What we need is a young lady to entertain the troops.
Hey, babes.
And then...
What are you tellin'? Huh?
Mm-hmm.
Set the table, please.
I'm sorry you got stuck in that big traffic jam out there today.
I have got a saucy, saucy redhead...
- Saucy.
- Who is dynamite.
Absolutely dynamite.
Everybody needs to give some too
Why, in fact her name is Suelynn Gay.
Well, if she's half as provocative as her name, we're home free.
I'm sorry I sprang this dinner on you.
I asked the man if he wanted to come to dinner, and he said yes.
One boy pushed me out.
- Were you out there by yourself?
- Wasn't it hot?
Thought I was gonna burn up.
We got in the car and turned on the air.
Coach said, "Go in the water."
I said, "Okay."
- What you tellin', Jimmy?
- Talkin' 'bout swimming class.
- He's telling about swimming class.
- Oh.
Did you swim today?
Did you learn anything?
- Huh?
- Hush! Let him tell it.
Then the coach said, "Ready?"
I said, "Yeah. Oh, boy."
Did it how I used to.
Then I went down to the diving board... and went... Whoo!
And touched bottom.
And I kept goin' through.
Walked on the bottom.
And then I come out.
Then I get two cards:
"Goldfish"and... and "Passed the test."
How about that?
They call you Gol...
They call you Goldfish?
Goldfish.
That's it.
Oh, dynamite! Dynamite!
Sueleen,
I'm so proud of you, baby.
- Thank you.
- You knocked 'em out up there.
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
All the people were goin'crazy!
Darlin', you're outta sight!
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, that's beautiful. Honey, it takes an attitude to be a star.
- What can I tell you?
- Do I get thejob, then?
I got you a job while you were singin'.
You did? Ohh!
A friend of mine called.
Very heavy.
There's a party
Monday night.
The pay is not much because it's a low-budget thing... $ 10.
I don't care about the money.
This must be some sort of amateur night.
- You're gonna be a star.
- I gotta make a phone call.
I'll be right back.
They are good, babe.
Mmm, I have to get that.
- That's all right. Go on.
- Where you goin'?
Telephone.
Mmm. Hello.
- Hi. Linnea?
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm here.
- Who is it?
This is Tom.
Just a minute.
I have something in my mouth.
- I was eatin' dinner.
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Now, who is it?
- This is Tom. Don't you remember?
No, I don't believe I do.
We met in the control room at the recording studio... about two months ago.
- Oh, yes. How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?
I'm just fine.
What are you doin' in Nashville?
I'm gonna do some recording.
I'm here for a couple weeks.
- I'd really like to see you.
- Come out to the house.
The children would love to meet you.
That's not exactly what I had in mind.
Look, I find you very attractive and I'd like to see you.
Well, I think it'd be fine if we had dinner some night here at the house.
- You've never met my husband Del.
- I see. You can't talk now.
I'll call you later. I'm going home.
I'll call you when I get there. Bye.
Wh... Uh, I'd like to...
Um...
All right. I'll talk to you later.
Thank you for calling.
- He's done well in those primaries.
- He sure has.
That's the key to it.
Who was it, babe?
Oh, down at the recording studio.
I left some, uh, music down there.
- What kind of a gun is it?
- A.38 Smith and Wesson special.
Uh, this particular gun's a stainless steel gun.
Did you ever have to shoot it?
We had to shoot it to qualify on the range, but I've never had to kill anyone with it.
'Course, there's been occasions where I have had to use it to...
See ya later, alligator.
Am I too late?
Well, Esther's asleep now.
She's looking forward to seeing you in the morning.
If the chairman of the board of your company... had been running your business... the way Washington has been running our business, you'd be asking a lot of questions, and you would find out what you already know... we have some problems that money alone won't solve.
Now, I know something about money.
Anybody who grew up without it knows a lot about money.
I know more about money than some of the rich, because I never had any until I was 27.
I know something of what money can do, and more important, I know something of what it can't do.
Does it make sense to let petroleum giants increase prices at will,
- adding to a staggering profit...
- Watch where you're going!
But tell the little filling station owner in his khakis...
- he can't charge one penny more?
- What's wrong with you, you dope?
To tax the salaries of people on poverty-level income,
I don't need that shit, you stupid... then give back in food stamps twice the amount of the tax.
Vote for Hal Phillip Walker!
If there's any cleaning up done, we're going to have to do it.
The Lord is not going to do the replacing, and the powers that be are certainly not going to replace themselves.
That old truth remains: There is no such thing as a free lunch.
- Hello.
- If the books are to be balanced, we're going to have to balance them.
- Yes, sir.
- You've got a room for rent?
Yeah. I'm Mr. Green.
That's me. I'm Mr. Green.
- I'd like to see it.
- What's your name again?
- Kenny. Kenny Fraiser.
- All right, sir, right this way.
Just go right through.
That's your room straight ahead there, Kenny.
My wife's been in the hospital, so the house is a little dusty, but there's clean sheets on the bed.
It's fine.
It's like my room at home.
And Kenny.
The toilet's down at the end of the hall.
- You a musician?
- Yeah.
Well, now, my niece is interested in music.
Martha!
This here is Kenny.
This is Martha.
- Hi!
- Hi.
She's from California.
- Uh, $ 13.50?
- That's right. $ 13.50 a week.
And you can have breakfast with me if you want.
Of course you'll have to help me wash the dishes.
Let me put this down and I'll pay you.
Gonna try whatever comes my way
Gonna do some heavy thinkin'
Good mornin'.
Barbara Jean, time to get...
- I must have the wrong room.
- I think you do.
Come on, Barbara Jean.
Time to get up. Come on.
- Hi.
- Good morning, Louise.
- Did you have a nice rest?
- Yeah. I was just having a dream.
Oh, I know the political physicians are laughing, but not quite as loud today as they were yesterday.
Sing
Sing a...
Del, are... Wait a minute.
You want me to fry you an egg?
No, honey, I'm gonna hard-boil me a couple eggs.
All right.
Sing, sing a song
The economy's depressed, not me
My spirit's high as it can be
And you may say
That I ain't free
But it don't worry me
It don't worry me
Wake up.
It don't worry me
You may say that I ain't free
But it don't worry me
You say this train
- Don't give out rides
- God.
- Well, it don't worry me
- God, I thought I was in Israel.
- All the world is takin'sides
- I don't know why.
- But it don't worry me
- Certainly not the decor, was it?
Must have been dreaming.
In my empire life is sweet
I was there for about a year on a kibbutz.
I was feeling very romantic about that kind of socialism at the time.
I thought I'd like to have a bash at it.
- Hello.
- Can I talk to Linnea, please?
- Del, I'm on the phone.
- Okay.
How are you? Listen, I'm sorry
I didn't call sooner, but...
- Who is this?
- This is Tom.
Tom who?
Oh, come on.
- Who is this? Tom who?
- This is Tom. Listen...
I don't know who you are,
I don't know why you're calling, and I want you to stop it.
- You know you want to see me.
- I never said any such thing.
And I'm not foolin'.
Don't you ever call here again!
What's goin' on... Hello? Linnea?
Hello?
Who was that, babe?
Just some crazy person been callin' here.
Next time he calls, you tell him you're gonna get the police on him.
Okay.
Come on. Sing
Sing a song
Make it simple to
Last your whole life long
Just sing
Sing a song
Yeah, he watched that.
How do you get outside, please?
- Dial "9."
- Oh, hi, Mr. Green.
Look at those flowers.
Did you grow those?
Esther and I did, yes.
My niece here picked 'em.
She's from California.
Oh, that's good.
They're so healthy.
Let me check and see if she's awake.
There's no reason why I can't use the phone.
May I see your credentials?
- I'll be happy to show them to you.
- Hi.
- Holy dogshit! Look at that!
- What is that?
That must be some friends of Buddy's.
Uh, Little Women.
Little Women!
Ever since that Easy Rider movie, that's the kind of bike everybody's been drivin'... long, low, laid back in front.
- They're so dangerous, aren't they?
- They are.
Over here at Baptist Hospital there's a whole ward of young boys, the cutest, best-lookin' boys you'd ever want to see, paralyzed from the waist down.
Oh!
Excuse me.
Thank you for the ride, darling.
Break a leg.
- Have you passed the bar yet?
- Oh, yeah.
- Not that bar.
- No, I know... Excuse me.
- Well, well, well. Young Hamilton.
- How are you?
- How are you?
- Fine, fine.
Give us a kiss, love.
You're a shy young man, aren't you?
- Is your dad around?
- Uh, yes, he is, but...
Do you think I could have a little chat with him?
He's kinda tied up right now, but maybe you could...
- Is your mom around?
- No. My mom is in Paris.
- This is Bergman.
- I like it.
- It's kinda nice.
- Pure, unadulterated Bergman.
It's beautiful.
You live here?
Yeah, we do.
We've been here for quite a while.
Lucky you! It's so gorgeous.
I've never seen...
Of course, the people are all wrong for Bergman, aren't they?
Well, I suppose you're interested in horses.
Uh, yeah.
I like horses. Sure.
Honey, you should arrange for him to visit one of our horse shows.
Haven breeds those famous Tennessee
Walkers you've heard about.
- Oh, really?
- Oh, he knows all about Walkers.
That is not the kind of walker
I had in mind.
- That's very fast.
- We have to be.
Well, she had this most horrible accident.
- Hi, Marie. How are you?
- How are you?
She got a lick on the head gettin' into one of those tiny cars.
Her daughter's car.
This happened almost a year ago.
No one had any idea this was gonna develop into such a horrible thing.
Mr., uh, Triplette,
I'm sorry ol' Delbert told you Haven would appear at the political rally.
He knows better than that.
We'd never let Haven Hamilton take sides politically.
Uh, you understand we give contributions to everybody.
And they are not puny contributions.
Only time I ever went hog-wild around the bend... was for the Kennedy boys.
But they were different.
Oh, yes, ma'am, they were.
That's a fact.
Excuse me a minute.
Thank you, Brenda.
Is this party somebody's birthday, or...
No, this is, uh...
I'm sure you've seen Haven Hamilton.
No, I never heard of him.
Do we get out here?
Let me, uh...
Let me get that door.
Listen, I wanted to ask...
Would it be all right if I asked Mr. Gould a question?
You wanna ask me something?
We're gonna be riding back with you.
Could we wait until then?
I just wanted to know what you were doing in Nashville.
I'm just coming to a party.
What are you doing in Nashville?
- Well, I'm stuck here.
- Yeah?
We'll see you in a bit.
Haven is singing tonight at the Grand Ole Opry, and this is just a previous sort of party for his friends.
Right. He's got a lot of photographers here, huh?
What are you doing here, anyway?
I came on a date, and now
I'm goin' to the Grand Ole Opry.
How you gon' go to the Grand Ole Opry?
You came with a date.
Is he gonna take you?
Huh? No, he...
They left.
No, I'm promoting a movie, but I'm not making one.
Are you a personal friend of Mr. Hamilton's?
Yeah, we're good friends.
Um, no, I'm not a singer.
I'm a businessman.
I take care of all Dad's business.
- You're a businessman?
- Yeah.
With that face?
You can't be a businessman.
Yeah, I... I work with, uh, Dad's company.
I take care of his records.
Anything that comes in comes though me.
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's great. It really is.
Dad's wanted me to do that all his life.
I'd be the last guy in the world to try and change your mind... about something you don't want to do, but I'd like to explain a couple things... about what we're trying to do in this campaign... before you discount it altogether.
And somehow the blood began to drain into behind her eyeball, and the pressure caused her eye just to bulge out.
It was just awful-lookin'. Everybody thought she was gonna lose her eye.
We still don't know how it's gon' come out.
I don't know how you're gonna feel about this, but...
Walker thinks that you'd make a fine governor in this state.
He thinks the time's right.
He thinks the people of Tennessee love you. He knows they do.
He knows how you feel about them.
And he wants you to know that, should the time come you want to run, he'll be there with his organization to back you all the way.
Elliot Gould,
Delbert and Linnea Reese.
- Mrs. Reese.
- And Mrs. Dorster. Elliot Gould.
You gonna be at Opryland tonight?
Well, I... I hadn't thought I would be.
Well, I'm gonna be at Opryland tonight.
Well, sure, I'll be there.
Yes, I guess you will.
And that's when
I'll give you my decision.
Well, thank you so much for thinking about it. Terrific.
- Is Haven around?
- He's right around the corner.
Would you check and see if it's all right if we come?
I see him with other people.
Thank you, Del.
- Do you want to be a singer?
- Oh, I...
- Look at me.
- I think everybody...
Dad wouldn't hear of it.
But you want to be a singer.
- I know him. That's Elliot Gould.
- This guy?
- He's a well-known actor.
- Oh, yes, with the curly hair.
Yeah. He was married to Barbra Streisand.
- He's grossin' real big.
- You gotta be kiddin' me.
No.
That girl that sang "People."
I just shook the man's hand like he was somebody off the street.
Oh, Delbert. Bring him on over.
- Yes, sir, I'll...
- Oh, Delbert!
We all walk on the street,
Delbert.
Oh, Delbert, Delbert.
Listen, you all come over.
Haven wants to meet you right away.
I didn't realize who you were when we first were introduced here.
You wrote a song?
Yeah, I wrote one song in my life.
- I'd love to hear it.
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
The sound of her hello
Soft and tenderly
The way she lights my morning
With her smile
And when she says I need you
Oh, I really need you
It makes my life so worthwhile
'Cause it comes from the heart
Of a gentle woman
It comes from the soul
Of an angel from above
And I'll stay in the heart
- Of a gentle...
- That's Elliot Gould!
Ha!
It's Elliot Gould!
Well, let me meet the movie star!
- Lady Pearl, Elliot Gould.
- Howdy!
- Haven Hamilton.
- Well, how do you do, Mr. Gould?
It's so nice to meet you. Welcome to Nashville and to my lovely home.
- Elliot! Elliot Gould!
- What brings you here?
- Oh, hello. Well, I'm just, uh...
- Hello!
- You look marvelous.
- Who is this?
- Another of your unexpected guests?
- I'm Opal from the BBC.
Remember the Cannes Film Festival?
No, of course you wouldn't.
- Is she connected with Mr. Gould?
- No, she's not.
What are you doing...
What am I doing in Nashville?
- Excuse me...
- I'm doing this documentary...
Excuse me, but Mr. Gould does not give interviews.
I don't know who you are or what you're doing here, but I will not tolerate rudeness in the presence of a star... two stars.
- We met at the Cannes...
- Just take her, Delbert. Good-bye.
Mr. Hamilton!
- It's gonna be all right. Listen...
- Who are you?
- Well, that's the price of success.
- It certainly is.
Go get a Goo Goo, friends, and settle back... for 30 of the goodest minutes in radio... the Goo Goo Grand Ole Opry!
It's sent your way by the makers of Goo Goo, the goodest candy bar in the world, and King Leo pure stick candy, the candy that roars with flavor.
Now a big welcome, if you please, for the Goo Goo man of the hour,
Tommy Brown!
I've been goin' down that long lonesome road, babe
And I've been doin' it for a while, yeah
I've been goin' down that long lonesome road, babe
Lookin' for a special smile
Now, I worked the bars
New York to Frisco
But I could never make it pay
You know how money goes
It slips right through your fingers
One more dollar
One more day
The bluebird
He has no money
The bluebird
He has no kin
The bluebird
He wears no time clock
He answers to the wind
That's as far as I can take you.
- Okay, this is it, all right.
- Yeah, all right.
- It's the new one!
- Yeah, I know.
- It's the new one, all right.
- Have you got the time?
Uh, yeah, it's, uh...
I shoved a hundred million quarters in that jukebox
I've served a barrelful of beer
Now I've listened to
Some troubles in my lifetime
I've seen a lot of grown men cry
You know that old tune called
"Over the Rainbow"
Well, if the bluebird flies then why can't I
I'm Del Reese, and I'm goin' back to Haven Hamilton's group.
- Remember me?
- This young lady's with me here.
I'm being interviewed by her.
And I really gotta go to the bathroom.
Time clock
He answers to the wind
He answers
To
The wind
Oh, yeah!
Thank you!
Thank you, Tommy.
Beautiful job, as always.
Say, Harold Weakly, have you been on vacation yet?
No, I've been busier than a puppy in a room full of rubber balls.
If you're like me, all that hustling and bustling makes you want... to let the world go by while you enjoy a Goo Goo candy cluster.
Hey, Steve.
She's with me.
- Excuse me. Can I help you?
- Oh, I'm with these people here.
- Do you have a backstage pass?
- They didn't need a pass.
You need a pass to get backstage.
- I never get enough
- Goo Goo's the perfect cluster...
- I always want more and more
- when you need quick energy.
- Even if we stay together
- Any time is Goo Goo time.
- Our whole lifetime through
- Pack Goo Goo in your lunch box.
I'll never get enough
I'll never get enough
I'll never get enough of you
Go get a Goo Goo, the South's favorite piece of candy for 62 years.
- You ready to do the song?
- Right.
Go get a Goo Goo
It's good
I don't know about killin' 'em.
They're already dead.
They're lucky to be alive.
Haven Hamilton!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, now.
Well, I want to thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome.
I'm sure you meant to share it with
Bud Hamilton, my son, who's here.
Stand up, Bud!
Isn't he somethin'else?
Yes, indeed.
Yes, indeed.
God bless you, and thank you so much for that warm welcome.
- How tall is that guy?
- Who?
- Haven.
- I'd like to do a treat for you.
- A brand-new song.
- Don't ever ask him that, John.
Unpack your bags
And try not to cry
I can't leave my wife
There's three reasons why
There's Jimmy
And Kathy
And sweet Lorelei
For the sake of the children
We must say good-bye
For the sake of the children
We must say good-bye
'Cause Jimmy's been wishin'
That I'd take him fishin'
His Little League pitchin'
Is somethin' to see
And Kathy's 13 now
She's my little queen now
And I've gotta see
Who her beau's gonna be
So unpack your bags
And try not to cry
- I can't leave my wife
- That's funny, because...
Oh, look! Connie White!
Connie White.
How are you, honey?
You remember you signed my album?
Well, thank you for coming to the show.
I have a song I wrote.
I'll give you a call tomorrow.
We'll just chat, you know, and...
You remember what I wrote on the program? Will you remember?
- "I'm your friend. Connie White."
- I like your dress.
I'm gonna get one too. But I like the gold one with the be...
You know, when you... when you have no waist.
Lori's just walkin'
She just started talkin'
And "Daddy"'s the first word
That she ever said
So unpack your bags
And try not to cry
I can't leave my wife
There's three reasons why
There's Jimmy
And Kathy
And sweet Lorelei
For the sake of the children
We must say good-bye
For the sake of the children
We must say good-bye
For the sake of the children
We must say good-bye
Thank you.
Thank you.
He's got the entire galaxy on the back of his shirt.
And now I'd like to do a special old favorite, the song that got me started in this business that's been so kind to me, a song you've loved through the years... and one I'm sure you're gonna love tonight.
"Keep A-Goin"'!
Thank you.
Well, if you strike a thorn on a rose
Keep a-goin'
And if it hails or if it snows
Keep a-goin'
Ain't no use to sit and whine
'Cause a fish ain't on your line
Bait your hook and keep a-tryin'
Keep a-goin'
When the weather kills your crop
Keep a-goin'
Why, it takes work to reach the top
Keep a-goin'
Well, now, Wilton's goin'!
Come on, Wilton!
Let's hear it for Wilton!
I think Joe's gonna be goin'soon.
You gettin'ready, Joe?
Yeah, Joe's goin'.
Now everybody's goin'!
And if the doctor says you're through
Keep a-goin'
Why, he's a human just like you
Keep a-goin'
Ain't no law says you must die
Wipe them tears from off your eye
Give ol' life another try
Keep a-goin'
Ain't no law says you must die
Wipe them tears from off your eye
Trust the Good Lord up on high
He'll help
Keep a-goin'
Keep a-goin'
Yes, sir!
Well, thank you.
Thank you and God love you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
We want to send very special wishes and greetings to Barbara Jean.
I know most of you read... that she collapsed out at the airport.
She's in the hospital. She's in
Vanderbilt Hospital recuperating.
Barnett tells me that she really cried real tears... because she couldn't be here with you tonight.
But I hope you'll send some letters and best wishes and prayers to her.
That's Vanderbilt Hospital,
Nashville, Tennessee, 27322.
And you tell her
Haven told you to write.
Now, as a special stand-in for her, we have her dear friend
Connie White, who got out of the dentist's chair this morning... where she was having some root canal work... and came all the way out here to sing for you.
Miss Connie White, who's a friend not only of Barbara Jean's... but a friend of yours and mine.
A wonderful singer in her own way...
Miss Connie White!
Come on out, Connie!
- Hi, Del. How are you?
- I want you to meet John Triplette.
You look so good.
Wonderful!
Isn't she lovely, folks?
Isn't she beautiful?
He's gonna do some things.
We'll talk about it later.
Nice seein' you.
Well, who do we have here?
- What is your name, honey?
- Paul Harris.
Paul Harris.
He's 13, he says.
And what's your name, honey?
Last time I saw a dress like that,
I was headin' to the junior prom.
You boys havin'a good time tonight?
Girl fell out of the car.
I want you to study real hard, because remember, any one of you can grow up to be the president.
Well, I'd like to go to Memphis
But I don't know the way
And I'd like to tell you how I feel
But I don't know what to say
And I'd love to go to heaven
But I forgot how to pray
So just help me keep from
Slidin' down some more
When I tried to get back to him
I got lost on the way
I'd like to start again tomorrow
But I, I don't know what day it is
And I'd sure like to love you
If you'd show me the way
And just help me keep from
Slidin' down some more
Well, I don't know what it's like out there
But in here it's gettin'darker
I got a lot of things to share
But it sure is gettin' late
Well, I'd like to give you all I got
But I don't know what that is
And I'd like to take you with me
But I don't know where that is
And I know there must be somethin' someplace
And some way to live
So just help me keep from
Slidin' down some more
Just help me keep from
Slidin' down some more
Some more
I know you love me
When I'm happy
And I know you love me when I shine
But will you love me
In the mornin'
When the baby makes you get up
One more time
Thank you!
I know you love me when I feel good
Love me every time
I make you laugh
Turn that off.
Okay. One more minute, darlin'.
- Right now.
- She'll be through in a moment.
I want you to turn it off right now!
It bothers me.
It bothers me too, but I gotta listen.
Why?
I gotta go to the King of the Road and thank her for you.
- Thank her?
- I gotta know what songs she sang.
You can ask anybody.
You can call. You can send flowers.
You can send a message.
Come on.
Don't get upset now.
You're makin' me ruin my nail polish job.
Do I tell you how to sing, darlin'? Hmm?
Have I ever told you how to sing a song?
That ain't the point.
I know why you're goin' over there.
Don't tell me how to run your life.
- I been doin' pretty good with it.
- You go... Wh...
Let's just calm down. We're both gettin' on each other's nerves.
You're goin' to the King of the Road so you can hobnob with everybody.
- So I can do what? "Hobnob"?
- I ain't got no friends.
I gotta sit here in this goddamn hospital.
They're all gonna talk about how I'm a nut.
I ain't doin' no hobnobbin'.
Now whoa, whoa, whoa.
"Barbara Jean had another collapse."
You know what?
While you're at it, why don't you take her some of my flowers?
Are you through?
No, I ain't. Take her this nice black one. That'll cheer her up.
- Why don't you try these.
- Are you through?
- And these.
- I said, are you through?
And why don't you try these!
Are you through, I said?
Are you throu...
Are you goin' nutsy on me? 'Cause I won't stand for that, Barbara Jean.
Huh? You havin' one of them nervous breakdowns again?
- Huh?
- No.
You coulda fooled me, 'cause it looks like you're ready for it.
Now, you just settle down and shape up. You understand?
The only reason I'm goin' over there is 'cause I love you.
I don't love to go over there and hobnob with them phonies.
Why do you make me raise my voice to you?
Why do you put us both through this?
You all right?
Come on, now. Let's have a little smile for Barnett.
- I'm tired of this place.
- Come on, now.
Now get up.
You help me, I help you.
All right? Come on, now.
Come on.
Now, where's Barnett goin'?
Where am I goin'?
Hmm?
- King of the Road.
- Why am I goin' there?
To see Connie.
And why am I doin' that?
To thank her for singin' at the Opry.
- Now, who am I doin' that for?
- You're doin' it for me.
That's right.
Now, I'm walkin' out now.
What do you say as I walk out?
You say "bye-bye."
Bye.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Barnett?
- Hello, Ben.
- Hi.
Aren't they wonderful?
So marvelous.
I'm really upset.
Wh... What are you upset about?
She's really late.
- Well, she's not that late.
- No, she's late.
- Thank you.
- He's right over there.
I thought you were very, very good tonight.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
She sounded beautiful.
She looked beautiful.
Well, Sue,
I didn't expect to see you.
- I want you to meet Julie Christie.
- Well, excuse my back.
- Welcome to Nashville.
- Doctor Zhivago.
- She the one who got off the train?
- Will you be here a while?
- No, just passing through.
- Oh, please sit down.
- Have a drink with us.
- We're not staying.
You're English, aren't you?
I could tell.
- This is Connie White.
- Hi.
- This is such a coincidence.
- I'm Del Reese.
I was talkin' about the
Christy Minstrels just this mornin', and now we have
Julie Christie here.
- I met you with Peter Finch.
- Oh, yeah?
- You won't sit down and stay?
- No, thank you.
- Julie has a friend at the Exit Inn.
- I hope your stay is very nice.
I hope you'll remember what film facilities we have in Nashville.
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you. Good to see you.
- Have a lovely evening. Good-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Nice to see you.
Well, isn't that an honor.
- What a surprise. Julie Christie.
- Who's Julie Christie?
"Who's Julie Christie?" She's a star. She's won an Academy Award.
- Oh!
- No, I'm not kiddin'.
For one of those pictures.
I don't know which one.
- She's done so many.
- Isn't he a gem?
- He's got the worst sense of humor.
- No, she's lovely.
Oh, come on.
She can't even comb her hair.
Oh, you've got a Hal Phillip Walker button.
No, it's Kennedy.
Isn't that rather ancient?
Strange. I thought that everybody in the South didn't go for Kennedy.
It's John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Well, he... he took the whole South, except for Tennessee,
Florida, Kentucky.
And there's a reason he didn't take Tennessee.
But he got 481,453 votes, and the asshole got 556,577 votes.
I just can tell.
It's somethin'.
It's the way she looks at me.
It's that feeling you get that you know there's somethin' going on.
And if I do a performance when
I'm too tired, it doesn't have...
- Hey, you all. How are you, Connie?
- Hi, Barnett.
Now, the problem we got here... is anti-Catholicism.
These dumbheads around here, they're all...
Baptists and whatever,
I don't know.
Even to teach 'em to make change over the bar... you gotta crack their skulls, let alone teach 'em to vote for the Catholic... just because he happens to be the better man.
Here, this is just somethin'... somethin' that Barbara Jean told me to pick up for you.
- You shouldn't have done that.
- I know, but she told me.
- I told her I shouldn't have.
- Did you get the flowers we sent?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
As most of you might have noticed, we have a celebrity with us tonight.
If we get our hands together, we might could get a song.
- Miss Connie White.
- From the goodness of her heart.
What do you want, a few bucks?
You holdin' out for somethin' better?
You're a real sweetie pie.
Thank you very much.
That's what I love about this place.
Can you see me?
I can't see you.
- That was a nice gesture.
- I'm gonna sing something you know.
- What was a nice gesture?
- Join me on the choruses.
Don't seem to be appreciated, do it?
"Rolling Stone."
Thank you.
You walked me, sweet Joshua
Down the country lane
You brought me, sweet Joshua
Where the roses grow so tall
You lay me down, Joshua
And you promised me your name
And after that
That was all
That was all
Everybody!
Rolling stone, Rolling stone
- Gathers no moss
- Who wrote that song, a kid?
And all I remember the next few days was...
I was just lookin' at that TV set and seein' it all, seein' that great fat-bellied sheriff... sayin',
"Ruby, you son of a bitch."
And Oswald... and her in her little pink suit.
But neither
Does it gather
Any love
Here's the best.
Here's Vassar.
And then comes Bobby.
Oh, I worked for him.
- Don't you think we...
- I worked all over the country.
I worked out in California, out in Stockton.
Bobby came here and spoke, he went down to Memphis, and then he even went out to Stockton, California... and spoke off the Santa Fe train at the old Santa Fe depot.
Oh, he was... a beautiful man.
He was not much like, uh, John, you know.
He was more puny-like.
But all the time
I was workin' for him...
I was just so scared.
Inside, you know?
Just scared.
Haven, do you think we could get Connie out to the rally?
Connie White and Barbara Jean never appear on the same stage together.
Connie can replace Barbara Jean, but that's it.
As for Haven Hamilton, well,
I'll appear wherever
Barbara Jean appears.
I got a good mind to take you outside.
With my wife in the hospital, you puttin' that shit on me?
- Calm down, enjoy the show.
- Barnett's angry.
Okay.
Walk with me, Joshua
- And I will say that I am lame
- I think she's, uh...
I think she's having an affair here.
I really do.
The child that we have made
- But I'll never let him mention
- Oh, God.
- Your name
- Are you off. You're way off.
You are way, way off.
Are you kidding?
Some people take
And never give
- I love you.
- But all men die
And so must live
For a while
And life is short
- I love you.
- A precious gift
This thing we have
- Please don't let it drift away
- I love you.
Honey, won't you let me be your friend
I love you.
I love you.
Honey, won't you let me try again
Honey, won't you let me be your friend
For another day
When we've been there
Ten thousand years
Bright, shining
As the sun
We've no less days
To sing God's praise
Than when
We'd first
Begun
And on the profession of your faith,
I baptize you, my sister, in the name of the Father and of the Son... and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
I'm newborn again
Been a long time talkin'
'Bout my trials here below
Free grace
Free grace
Free grace, sinner
Free grace
Free grace
I'm newborn again
And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And he tells me
I am His own
And the joy we share
As we tarry there
None other
Has ever
Known
He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet
The birds hush their singing
And the melody
That He gave to me
Within my heart
Is ringin'
You know, my wife Esther is on the same floor with Barbara Jean.
- And He walks with me
- Oh, and Esther and I had a son...
- And He talks with me
- in the service too.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, not the army. It was the navy.
And He tells me
I am His own
We lost him in the South Pacific.
We don't know how.
- And thejoy we share
- I'm sorry.
- World War II.
- Yes, sir.
As we tarry there
None other
Has ever
Known
I'm wandering in a graveyard.
The dead here have no crosses, nor tombstones, nor wreaths to sing of their past glory, but lie in rotting, decaying, rusty heaps, their innards ripped out by greedy, vulturous hands.
Their vast, vacant skeletons... sadly sighing to the sky.
The rust on their bodies... is the color of dried blood.
Dried blood.
I'm reminded of... of an elephant's secret burial ground.
Yes.
Cette aire de mystère.
Cette essence de I'irréel.
These cars are trying to communicate.
O cars, are you trying to tell me something?
Are you trying to convey to me some secret...
What... Excuse me?
Oh, excuse me.
I thought I was completely alone.
How embarrassing.
Oh, you're a musician!
The economy's depressed, not me
You may say that I ain't free
But it don't
Worry
Me
Let's have some applause for Miss Maisie Hoy.
Miss Albuquerque?
Hi, Frog.
This is with gestures.
Miss Jill Brown on the track in number 78.
The youngsters will be eligible... to apply for a gas-powered mini-bike and a helmet.
You wanna talk about yesterday?
Get up, goddamn it!
Fucker.
You wanna talk about yesterday?
Do you wanna talk about yesterday or not? What, are you...
Shit.
Come out of there!
You leave me alone!
Come out of there!
Come on!
Look, I know what's...
Come on!
For Christ's sake, what...
Now, you...
What are you doing? Do you wanna talk about yesterday or not?
Oh, that's terrific.
Hey, that's great. Hey, terrific.
Oh, thanks. My turtle.
Thanks a lot.
Look, just relax!
Look, I know what's goin' on.
Great.
House detective.
Bill, hi.
I'm John Triplette.
Am I early?
I called you this morning.
Oh, yeah. The guy from TV.
Come on in.
Sure.
Just... We're just cleanin' up here.
You know the...
- Sunday morning blues.
- Would you hold this?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Let me just move this over here.
- Is this your new album?
- Yeah. That's our only album.
It's a very good one, though.
I've heard it. It's terrific.
- I'm really sorry about the mess.
- Oh, that's all right.
You oughta see my room.
We had a little party last night.
Had a pretty good time too.
Uh, I wanted to, um, tell you a couple things about what we're trying to do with this show.
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, no, I'm fine.
I don't wanna take up much of your time.
I just wanna tell you a little bit about what we're trying to do.
I know you're astute politically, and I'm certainly not here to sell you a bill of goods.
- Don't care about politics.
- No politics? Okay, great.
Well, then, I've got a problem that could work to your advantage.
As you know, this redneck music is very popular right now.
I've got an awful lot of these local yokels on the bill singing...
- Your basic country folk.
- Country crapola. Right.
So I think, uh...
What I'm going for is a broader appeal.
Which is where we fit in.
I want to give it more than just this Southern thing.
And I think that a really hip group like yours... could walk off with the evening.
Yeah. Probably the only rock group on the...
- Absolutely.
- Sounds good.
- Sounds inviting.
- Yeah.
And you do get a big audience from these country guys.
Is this just network, or...
It's better than network.
It's syndicated.
They'll be showing it for a year and a half.
- Your glasses, sweetheart.
- Oh, thanks.
This is my wife Mary.
This is John Triplette.
Nice to meet you.
Go ahead.
He's, uh, he's the fella from the television show... that they're doing for Hal Phillip Walker.
That political thing going on.
He's offered us a spot.
You're doing some great promotion.
All those buttons and...
- Oh, yeah, thank you. I'm trying.
- Bumper stickers.
Anyway, we got a great time spot on this gala, and we're gonna walk away with the show, John says.
We can't vote for him.
We're registered Democrats.
Besides, he's a little crazy, isn't he?
Well, they're all a little crazy, Mary.
- I'll drink to that.
- That's the name of the game.
But I think the thing that you should consider is your future.
It would give you a great shot.
But it doesn't make any difference.
We're registered Democrats.
Well, I'm a registered Democrat.
The only reason we're registered Democrats... is because your father's a registered Democrat... and his father's a registered Democrat.
Well, Tom's a registered Democrat, and he wouldn't do it.
It's not my way
To take your hand if I'm...
- Hi, Tom.
- Hi, Norman. How you doin'?
Good. I'm sure glad you called.
Is there anything I can...
- Sit down.
- Okay.
Whew.
- You have any speckled birds?
- What?
You know, L.A. Turnarounds.
Uppers.
Uh, no, no, I, uh...
But I know where to get some grass.
- No, thanks. I don't need any grass.
- Okay.
- Uh, can I ask you a question?
- Mm-hmm.
Is there something...
Are you angry at Bill?
- No.
- Oh.
'Cause I, I, uh...
You know, I, uh...
Bill and Mary and you and, uh...
Well, Bill, uh...
I mean, Bill seems to be, um...
Uh...
- I'm just confused.
- Mmm.
- Uh...
- Here.
- Why don't you write yourself a hit.
- Okay.
- Hello.
- Can I talk to Cherry, please?
She's in bed with R.Y.
You wanna talk to R.Y.?
- I'd rather talk to her, if I could.
- Who is this?
This is Frank, one of the cooks at the restaurant.
Are you a Jehovah's Witness?
Does it make sense that the churches... should remain untaxed on their vast holdings of land... and corporate investments?
Does it make sense that a multimillion-dollar income... should go untaxed year after year?
No, all will not be easy, but we will bask in the satisfaction... of having done what we should have done.
And if we don't get it done today, we may run out of tomorrows.
The buses!
The buses are empty... and look almost menacing, threatening, as so many yellow dragons watching me... with their hollow, vacant eyes.
I wonder how many little black and white children... have yellow nightmares, their own special brand of fear for the yellow peril...
I can't have...
I can't start...
Damn it, it's got to be more... positive.
No, more negative.
Start again.
Yellow is the color of caution.
No.
Yellow is the color of cowardice.
Yellow is the color of sunshine.
And yet I see very little sunshine... in the lives of all the little black and white children.
I see their lives, rather, as a study in grayness, a mixture of black and...
Oh, Christ, no.
That's fascist.
Yellow! Yellow, yellow, yellow.
Yellow fever.
We'll be able to talk about it.
They're checkin' out now.
- Get with him before he leaves.
- What about the place?
- It's not bad at all.
- Think it'll work out?
It's got this bizarre stage that drops out of the ceiling.
They're gettin' out this mornin'.
- The place is very confused.
- Bye-bye!
- Is the place out there okay?
- Bye-bye, bye-bye.
Wait a minute.
Here we go.
Uh, Barnett!
Phone's for you.
- Is it important, or what?
- Bye, girls.
- Hello.
- Hello, Barnett. John Triplette.
- Who?
- Hello! Are you going home?
Mr. Green, how are you?
I'm goin' home.
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you. How is Mrs. Green?
She's fine, and she's gonna be thrilled to hear I saw you again.
Give her my very best.
And is she takin' her vitamin E?
- Got 'em right here.
- All right. Good for you.
You take care, darlin'.
Bye-bye.
All right, come on.
Let's get her on there.
- Lucky for you. Whoo!
- As long as I'm done
- Gonna buy me a pistol
- All right, get in.
We gotta go with those white horseshoes, huh?
We're gonna live with those for infamy.
Take that cortege on the other elevator.
- Didn't the doctor get ahold of you?
- No more calls, Delbert.
I'm really sorry
I have to tell you this.
Mrs. Green expired this morning.
What?
Mrs. Green died this morning.
Wait right here.
Let me go get the doctor.
Mr. Green?
Mr. Green, you know, my mama saved her life.
They used to live next door to each other. My mama put out the flames.
She always loved Barbara Jean more than anything.
She's still keepin' a scrapbook on her.
The only thing she said to me when I joined up was,
"When you're doin' your travels,
I want you to see Barbara Jean.
Don't say nothin' about me.
Just see Barbara Jean."
So that's what I been doin'.
Now I'm gonna go over to Opryland and hear her sing.
Give my best to your wife, now.
Wait a minute. Don't laugh.
Let me just... I have a theory about political assassination.
You see, I believe people like Madame Pearl... and all these people here in this country who carry guns... are the real assassins.
Because, you see, they stimulate other people... who are perhaps innocent... and who eventually are the ones who pull the trigger.
- Ma?
- Kenny? Where are you, Kenny?
- I'm in Nashville. How are you?
- I was so worried.
- There's no reason to worry.
- Well, I haven't been able to sleep.
I had to take some of that Ny Quil so I could go to sleep.
- Puts you right out.
- Did it help?
Yes, it did.
Where are you staying in Nashville?
- I'm staying at a rooming house.
- Who you talkin' to?
- It's my mother.
- Who are you talking to, Kenny?
A girl that lives in the rooming house.
Who owns that rooming house?
- Her uncle.
- A man owns the rooming house?
Well, it can't be very clean.
- Don't be silly.
- I bet the sheets aren't clean.
In the South you can pick up this parasite...
- Joan, put that down, please!
- Kenny, listen...
- Just a minute.
- I wanted to look at your fiddle.
Kenny! You can get this parasite fungus in the South.
It's very difficult to get rid of.
When are you coming home?
I don't know.
A couple of weeks.
You left your blue suit hanging in the closet.
I don't need my suit.
I would really like you to get home as soon as you can.
Mother, just listen to me.
Kenny, don't you talk to me in that tone of voice.
I love you too, Mama.
I really do.
I'll see you soon.
Bye-bye.
Let's find Barnett, hope he's not in a bad mood.
Hi. How are you?
- Hey, Barnett!
- I'm obliged to give them...
- Hey, Barnett.
- What do you want now?
This guy wants me to do four shows.
What do you want?
Don't let her do too much.
How you hangin'?
- You feelin' better now?
- Yeah, I feel swell.
We gotta talk to you.
We're gonna do a show.
Okay, now, John's doing this show.
Haven's gonna do it.
We want Barbara Jean to headline it.
- Unbelievable.
- Now wait a second, man.
I wish they wouldn't rush us.
Get a shot.
It's national TVfor this candidate
Hal Phillip Walker.
We don't want her to make any political statement.
What do you think her bein' there's gonna be?
- Ain't that a political statement?
- People haven't seen her.
No, fellas.
Don't take it personal.
No politics, no government, no nothin'.
- All right? Okay?
- All right.
- I heard you all out.
- Hello, boys. How's it goin'?
I believe I met you before in the hospital.
Look at that. Didn't Jewel show you how to do her hair?
- Come on, darlin'.
- How do you do, honey?
- No pictures.
- I'm all excited.
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.
I told the band you'd start off with the cowboy song.
- Forget it.
- No, John, just leave it to me.
He can take a flying leap.
I'm gonna stay after him like a rodent, man.
He's got a tape deck in his tractor
And he listens to the local news
He finds out where the bass are bitin'
While he's plowin' to the country blues
He was a cowboy and he knew I loved him well
A cowboy's secrets you never tell
No, there's nothin' like the lovin'
Of a hard-drivin'cowboy man
He's got a tape deck in his tractor
While he's plowing up his daddy's land
He's got more horse sense
Than I ever seen in any man
He was a cowboy and he knew I loved him well
A cowboy's secrets you never tell
No, there's nothin' like the lovin'
Of a hard-drivin' cowboy man
On Saturday nights we go dancin' in town
And all the boys'll order up another round
In the summertime
We look forward to the rodeo
On Saturday nights we go to town
And all the boys'll order up another round
When he rides saddle bronc
I wait to hear that whistle blow
He's got a tape deck in his tractor
I can hear him when he's comin' home
Then he holds me in the rocking chair
And sings me the love song
He was a cowboy and he knew I loved him well
A cowboy's secrets you never tell
No, there's nothin' like the lovin'
Of a hard-drivin' cowboy man
No, there's nothin' like the muscles
Of a hard-drivin' cowboy man
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's that careless
Disrespect
I can't take no more, baby
It's the way
That you don't love me
When you say you do, baby
It hurts so bad
It gets me down, down, down
I want to walk away
From this battleground
This hurtin' match
It ain't no good
I'd give a lot to love you
The way I used to do
Wish I could
Mm-hmm-hmmm
Well, you got
Your own private world
I wouldn't have it
No other way
But lately you been
Hidin'your blues
Pretendin' what you say
It hurts so bad
It gets me down, down, down
I wanna walk away from this battleground
This hurtin' match
It ain't no good
I'd give a lot to love you
The way I used to do
Wish I could
Mmm-mmm-mmmm-mmm
Have you been in Vietnam?
- Huh?
- Writin'it down
Kind of makes me feel better
Yes, you have.
I can tell by your face.
It keeps me away from them blues
I wanna be nice to you
Treat you right
But how long can I pay
These dues
It hurts so bad
It gets me down, down, down
I wanna walk away from this battleground
This hurtin' match
It ain't no good, no
I'd give a lot to love you
The way I used to do
Wish I could
Mmm-mmm-mmmm-mmm
Was it awful?
- Ooh-oooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
- It was kinda hot and wet.
Ooooh
Oooh
Oooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooooh
I
Wish I could
Mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wanna tell you all a little secret which you might not know, and that is that last night
I thanked my lucky stars... that I could be here at all to sing for ya.
I heard on the radio...
This little boy... 9 years old.
Sometimes a deejay'll play a tune... and ask everybody to phone in and say how they like it.
I was listenin', and this little nine-year-old called in.
The song had voices in the background, like the way they use backup voices these days, soundin' like little munchkins.
He called up, the deejay said,
"How old are you, son?"
The boy said, "I'm nine, and I think it's gonna be a hit."
The deejay said, "Why?" "Because it had those chipmunks in it."
And I thought that was so cute, because, well, I can sing like a munchkin myself.
I'm real fond of The Wizard of Oz.
Plus, I live out, you know, just a ways off of Interstate 24... on the road to Chattanooga.
So you can see why
I kinda related to that.
I think me and the boys are gonna strike up another tune for you now.
Let's go, boys.
I think there's a storm... seems like it's a-brewin'.
That's what my grandaddy used to say before he lost his hearin'.
Once he got deaf, he never talked much no more.
'Cept sometimes he'd say "Oh, gosh" or "Durn it" or "My word!"
My granny'd go around clickin' her teeth to the radio all day.
Boy, was she a lot of fun, and cooked my favorite, roast beef.
She was a sweetheart.
She raised chickens too.
She, um...
Did you ever hear a chicken sound?
You know how chickens go?
Here, chick, chick, chick.
Here, chick, chick, chick.
Anyway, I guess we'd better strike up this tune before it's too late.
Okay, boys.
The first job I ever really got...
Grandma... She's the one who clacked her false teeth to the radio.
She taught my mama how to sing, and my mama taught me.
One time she took me, 'cause we was gonna get a new Frigidaire.
She took me to the Frigidaire store where the man was advertisin'.
This record was goin' 'round, and
Mama told him I knew how to sing.
He said, "If she learns this tune,
I'll give y'all a quarter."
So Mama and I went home...
And then what happened?
Let's see, I think... Uh, yeah.
We went home and I learned both sides of the record in half an hour.
We went back and told him that
I'd learned 'em, and he said,
"Let me hear," so I sang both sides of the record instead of just one.
So he gave us 50 cents, and we went across the street and had us a soda.
Ever since then
I been workin'. I don't...
I think ever since then
I been workin' and doin' my...
- Come on, come on.
- Supportin'myself.
- Anyway...
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
- Am I all right? Am I all right?
- Oh, you're fine, darlin'.
- It's the microphone.
- I ain't done.
- I know, I know.
- I ain't done.
Get us a glass of water.
Boys, help her off, all right?
- You'll come back. Okay, darlin'?
- Thank you!
All right. Watch the wire.
All right, now! Okay!
Aw, come on, now.
Have a heart.
Thank you!
Come on, now.
It's just too soon, now.
All of you must know... Aw, come on.
You didn't mean that, did you?
She just come out of the hospital...
Oh, no. Hold it down, boys.
You know that little girl just come out of the hospital.
That little girl's in there cryin' her eyes out...
'cause she didn't want to disappoint you.
Get outta here!
Y'all show up at Centennial Park tomorrow at the Parthenon.
You'll see her for free as our guests. How's that?
All right?
Okay, let's hear a get-well welcome for Barbara Jean.
Let's hear it. Come on!
Ingrates is all they are.
A bunch of no-talent...
I got trapped out there, and you guys know it.
- I want some ground rules right now.
- You name it.
She's gonna sing first and be off before that man even shows.
Fine.
Whatever you want.
- Never shoulda brought her here.
- Any way you want it.
No paraphernalia, no literature being circulated. You understand?
And never, at any time, is she to be associated with Hal Phillip Walker.
- Hello?
- Hey.
Guess who.
- Linnea?
- Yes, it's me.
Hi. This is Tom.
I'm playing a gig tonight downtown.
You wanna come and meet me?
It's at a place called the, uh, No Exit, or the Exit.
Exit Out, or somethin'.
Anyhow, it's right across the street from Friday's, on Church Street.
You know where that is, don't you?
Anyhow, I'll be there at 8:00, and, uh...
Why don't you meet me there?
- Okay?
- Um...
Well, it's sad but true
The pilot light of our love
Has flickered out
- Mary...
- Driver, may I have more champagne?
- That's Norman.
- Oh.
Norman, yes.
Norman. Of course.
He doesn't like to be known as a driver.
Thank you so much, Norman.
What used to come from the warmest heart
I have to get from a cold can
Since my baby's cookin'in
Another man's pan
Have you ever been to the ladies' restroom here?
No.
I'm stuck here at the Exit Inn with no place left to go.
Well, if makin'love
Were margarine
Then she is the high-priced spread
- I'll have a cider.
- Apple cider?
- Yes. Thank you.
- Put it on my bill.
- Oh, no...
- Yeah.
Uh, all right. And would you put it in a wine glass, please?
Put it in a wine glass and put it on my bill.
Traveling in cozy, close quarters,
I mean, you sort of have to camp in one room.
- Well, Mary and I camp in one room.
- Obviously!
- Yes, I...
- Tom camps in a lot of rooms.
My name's Wade Coolidge.
What's yours?
Um, Linnea is my name.
Well, shall I say that Tom and I, um...
Oh, la-dee-dee!
So you sang together.
No, I mean, we sort of got to know each other, um, in the biblical sense, shall we say.
- You went to church?
- I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
This is dreadful.
But he is so attractive,
I was wondering...
I shouldn't be asking you,
I should really be asking Mary.
You went to bed with him, right?
Oh, yeah.
I thought you understood that.
Well, I shouldn't...
Where'd you go to bed with him?
Listen, uh, we got a special treat tonight.
A friend of mine is in town cuttin' an album.
- Tom Frank is in the audience.
- That's you.
Tom? Speak of the devil.
He's agreed to come up and do a couple of numbers.
Let's make him feel at home.
Tom Frank!
Come on!
Goddamn it!
I haven't seen him for more than two minutes in three days.
Thank you.
- I used to be part of a trio.
- Used to be?
I been hidin' from 'em all week, but it seems they found me here tonight, so we might as well have them up here to sing too... Bill and Mary.
Lovely!
Yes, you must!
I've been watching it all week.
You may say I ain't free
But it don't worry me
- It don't worry me
- My favorite song.
- It don't worry me
- We don't need to sing at all.
- You guys can do it for us.
- You may say I ain't free
- Good choice.
- But it don't worry me
Since you've gone
My heart is broken
Another time
Oh, railroad train
Has taken him
From me
All my luxury
Has turned to misery
He's all I ever wanted
Why did he run from me
Since you've gone
My heart is broken
Another time
Since you've gone
My heart is broken
Another time
I didn't know
That you were leavin'
- Till you were out the door
- Out the door
I didn't know
The love you gave
Was a real love
I didn't know
A lot of things then
Lord, I know them now
Since you've gone my heart is broken
- Another time
- Another time
Mmm.
Since you've gone
My heart is broken
Another time
Since you've gone
My heart is broken
Another time
When this is all over, I'm gonna be taking them back to someplace.
What I could do is, I could show you a little bit of Nashville.
I can tell you things that'd send you around the corner.
I'm not kidding. I know...
Well, I know, for instance...
- What is your name? L...
- Norman.
Norman.
Please, Norman, I...
I make a point never to gossip with servants.
Thank you.
Okay, fellas,
I think you know... you've got a good man to get behind.
I don't wanna take a lot of your time,
'cause we do have a little entertainment for ya.
You got pledge cards on the table.
You can pledge anything you want to.
I'll make sure... I'll make you pay, whatever you put down there.
If you got a check, don't be afraid to write it out.
I'll get that to the bank quick, before you can stop it.
Any cash, anything at all, don't anybody be humble or shy.
And while you're writin', so you don't get bored or anything, there's somethin' comin' to keep you occupied.
Just keep your eyes up,
'cause good things come from above.
Hi, y'all.
- Hi!
- Hi!
My name's Sueleen Gay, and I'm here to sing you a song about a girl that never gets enough.
I never get enough
I never get enough
Of the love I'm hungry for
I never get enough
I never get enough
I always want more and more
Even if we stay together
Our whole lifetime through
I'll never get enough
I'll never get enough
I'll never get enough of you
She's the worst singer
I ever heard.
I ain't greedy for that mansion on the hill
She cannot sing a lick, can she?
I never was that kind
Don't need my pockets stuffed
With hundred-dollar bills
Hey, you forgot your jacket.
Excuse me.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
All right, if you want more it's gonna have to be me alone,
'cause it seems
I'vejust been deserted.
I'm gonna play somethin'that, uh,
I wrotejust recently...
- and came here to record.
- All right!
I'm gonna dedicate this to someone special who might be here tonight.
This is a song called
"I'm Easy."
It's not my way to love you just when no one's lookin'
It's not my way
To take your hand if I'm not sure
It's not my way to let you see
What's goin' on inside of me
When it's a love you won't be needing
If you're not free
Please stop pullin' at my sleeve
If you're just playin'
If you won't take the things you make me wanna give
I never cared too much for games
And this one's drivin' me insane
You're not half as free to wander
As you claim
But I'm easy
Yeah, I'm easy
Give the word
I'll play your game
As though that's how it oughta be
Because I'm easy
Don't lead me on if there's nowhere
For you to take me
If lovin'you would have to be
A sometime thing
I can't put bars on my insides
My love is somethin'
I can't hide
It still hurts
When I recall the times I've tried
But I'm easy
Yeah, I'm easy
Take my hand and pull me down
I won't put up any fight
Because I'm easy
Don't do me favors
Let me watch you from a distance
'Cause when you're near
I find it hard to keep my head
And when your eyes throw light at mine
It's enough to change my mind
Make me leave my cautious words and ways behind
That's why I'm easy
Yeah, I'm easy
Say you want me
I'll come runnin'
Without takin'time to think
Because I'm easy
Yeah, I'm easy
Take my hand and pull me down
I won't put up any fight
Because I'm easy
Yeah, I'm easy
Give the word
I'll play your game
As though that's how it oughta be
Because I'm easy
Do it to it.
- Hi.
- Hi!
I'm gonna sing you all a song Barbara Jean wrote.
Just wanna get comfortable.
It's called, uh,
"One, I Love You."
Oh, you got that right, babe!
When I feel my life perishing
I call you on the phone
You always fix me up
When I get broken
'Cause every time that I got hurt
And went out of control
You knew the fears I felt
Before I spoke 'em
Boo! Come on, now!
- What is this, some Walker rip-off?
- One, I love you
Two
I'm thinkin'of you
Three
I'll never let you go
Boo! Come on! Take it off!
And four, I miss you
Five, I wanna kiss you
Six
I won't leave you no more
- Did you tell Trout what you wanted?
- Did I? It was your job.
- I know.
- I assumed he knew what...
Well, I didn't think it was gonna be any problem.
Four, I miss you
- Five, I wanna kiss you
- Take your clothes off!
Six
I won't leave you no more
Let's see some tit!
Come on!
What is this?
Come on back here, baby!
- What's the matter, hon?
- I don't understand what's goin' on.
Didn't Trout tell you you're supposed to strip?
I'm a singer!
Listen.
Listen, listen, listen.
Go finish the show like you told Trout you'd do, and I'll set it up so you can sing at the Parthenon.
You can sing in the Parthenon with Barbara Jean.
- Go finish the show...
- I get to sing with Barbara Jean?
Yes, you are...
Yes, you will.
I'll take care of it. Go finish the show like you told Trout you'd do.
Okay?
These fellas really like you.
I'm gonna be as big a star as Barbara Jean is one day.
- I know you are. You can't miss.
- Go on, now.
Come on, let's do it!
Start the show!
Whoo! Hey!
All right! All right!
You're my mama!
All right!
Whoo! Hey, hey, hey!
But I'm easy
Yeah, I'm easy
Take my hand and pull me down
I won't put up any fight
Because I'm easy
Want to learn how to say something in sign language?
Yeah.
How do you say "I love you"?
Well, you could say...
Shorthand for it is...
This is shorthand.
Or you could say, "I," you could say, "love you."
- "I love you"?
- Mm-hmm.
Or you could just say,
"I'm happy I met you."
- I'm happy I met you.
- Right.
Say you want me
I'll come runnin'
- Without takin'time to think
- Phew.
- How can you smoke those things?
- 'Cause I'm easy
- It's easy.
- Yeah, I'm easy
Let me have a drag.
- Do you smoke?
- No.
Well, what do you want to do that for?
Yeah, I'm easy
Give the word
I'll play your game
- Doesn't look good.
- No?
- Mm-mmm.
- So what?
Because I'm easy
- Tom, I have to go.
- Oh.
Can't you just call him, tell him you're hung up?
No, I can't.
- Couldn't you stay another hour?
- No.
I just can't.
This is the long-distance operator.
- You want this charged to your room?
- Yeah, please.
- And your room number, please?
- Hello.
- Hey.
- How you doin'?
- Oh, wow.
Listen, I'm real sorry
I left the way I did.
Oh, wow.
It's really nice to talk to you.
It's okay.
It's nice to talk to you too.
- What are you doing?
- I'm thinkin'about you.
You are? Well...
Listen, can you come down here?
- When?
- Tonight.
- Oh, Tom, I can't do that.
- Why not?
We have an opening at the museum tomorrow. I can't leave my job.
Why don't you quit?
I'm makin'bread here.
We tried that before.
It doesn't work. I need to be busy.
I'll wait for you here.
When are you coming back?
About a week.
Okay, well, just... just come on back.
Move back in.
It's fine.
I miss you.
I really do.
New York's really been nice.
It's missed you too.
The weather's been terrific.
I went sailing.
- Yeah.
- What's that?
That's just room service.
There's 50 cents on the desk there.
Just pick it up.
- Big tipper.
- Yeah, well, times are hard.
Right, all that money. You couldn't afford to bring me down there.
- Yeah. Well, see you in a week.
- I love you, Tom.
This it, honey?
Be careful gettin' out.
Hey.
Hey! Hey, wait just a minute.
Just hold it, will ya.
Now...
I know you don't do that all the time, I...
I wanna tell you that I just... I mean...
Me personally, boy, I...
You know, I'd just like to kiss you all over, every place.
You know what I'm telling you?
- I think you...
- Sueleen?
You okay?
Shit, man.
Didn't your mama teach you no manners?
Who was that?
What's the matter with you?
Ain't you gonna talk to me?
Did it go all right?
- Oh, Wade.
- What?
I had to do me a striptease tonight in front of all those men... in order to get to sing at the Parthenon with Barbara Jean.
Oh, shit, Sueleen, I...
That's dreadful!
That's terrible, girl!
I mean...
I don't know how to tell you this, but I been meanin' to... you can't sing.
You may as well face the fact you cannot sing.
You ain't never gon' be no star.
I wish you'd give it up.
They gon' kill ya. They gon' tear your heart out if you keep on.
They gon' walk on your soul, girl.
- What are you talkin' about?
- You can't sing.
- Do you understand that?
- Yeah? You wanna make a bet?
You wanna come to the Parthenon and watch me sing with Barbara Jean?
- I am leavin' for Detroit Wednesday.
- You just come and watch, Wade.
I'm leavin' for Detroit, and if you wanna go you just come on.
- They gonna kill you in this town.
- Well, you come and see.
- They gon' use you. You know that.
- Bye, Wade.
Dumb bitch.
I don't know why I stick around.
She just makes me so goddamn mad
I could spit.
Little more than a year ago, a man named Hal Phillip Walker... excited a group of college students with some questions:
Have you stood on a high and windy hill... and heard the acorns drop and roll?
Have you walked in the valley beside the brook, walked alone and remembered?
Does Christmas smell like oranges to you?
In a commencement speech such questions were fitting, perhaps, but hardly the material with which to launch a presidential campaign.
Even those who pay close attention to politics... probably saw Hal Phillip Walker and his Replacement Party... as a bit of frost on the hillside... summer, if not late spring, would surely do away with all that.
Well, now that summer, along with presidential primaries, is heavy upon us... and the frost is still there, perhaps we should take a closer look.
Hal Phillip Walker is, in a way, a mystery man.
Out of nowhere, with a handful of students and scarcely any pros, he's managed to win three presidential primaries... and is given a fighting chance to take a fourth... Tennessee.
A win in that state would take on added significance, for only once in the last 50 years has Tennessee failed to vote... for the winning presidential candidate.
No doubt many Americans, especially party liners, wish that Hal Phillip Walker would go away, disappear like the natural frost... and come again at some more convenient season.
But wherever he may be going, it seems sure Hal Phillip Walker is not going away, for there is genuine appeal... and it must be related to the raw courage of this man... running for president, willing to battle vast oil companies, eliminate subsidies to farmers, tax churches, abolish the electoral college, change the national anthem... and remove lawyers from government, especially from Congress.
At this point it'd be wise to say most of us don't know the answer... to Hal Phillip Walker, but to answer one of his questions, as a matter of fact, Christmas has always smelled like oranges to me.
Our country cries
For peace today
There's trouble in
The U.S.A.
Watergate
Is the sound that rings
Wonder what
This year will bring
- You're going the wrong way!
- Wonder what
This year will bring
- All y'all goin' the wrong way!
- Will there be sadness
Tears or pain
Or will the sun
Refuse to shine
Wonder what
This year will bring
Down in Nashville
I heard today
A shortage of food
Is on its way
While up in Denver
Gas shortage rings
Lord, I wonder what
- This year will bring
- You may have to sit out here.
That's all right, John.
- Give me time to work on my speech.
- Okay, thank you.
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.
Or will the sun
Refuse to shine
- Delbert, how's it going?
- Hi, John. How are you?
- Can I say hello?
- He's working on his speech.
- We'll do that later.
- Right.
- He's gonna wait there?
- He'll sit out there for a minute.
- Anybody here yet?
- Yeah, some of the people.
- Barnett?
- He oughta be here quick.
This building was originally here...
It was made out of lumber and plaster of Paris.
- Oh, yeah?
- This whole big building...
See, they built it for a centennial celebration, and people liked this, they didn't want it torn down.
Nashville got to be called the Athens of the South.
- They sorta took to that.
- Because of this building?
- Yeah, right.
- Oh, that's good.
Then they had to rebuild it. This was built right before I was born.
Whoo!
Gonna be a scorcher.
The park police control all this.
What's all these chairs?
We don't need all these chairs.
- This ain't no band here, right?
- What's the matter, man?
I don't...
I don't believe it!
What's the matter?
Are you guys jerkin' me around?
Do you see what I see, or am I...
What the hell is that sign doin' up there, Triple?
We had some ground rules.
No political signs, no advertisements, no noth...
What the hell are you doin', huh?
Go about your business.
I have abided by all the ground rules you laid down, Barnett.
I have Walker sitting out behind this place like an idiot!
Well, he can sit out in the sun and parch for all I care!
My wife ain't well! I brought her out of a hospital bed to be here!
You gave me some truth! You're full of it, just like your man!
- I have abided by every ground rule.
- Except what?
She ain't gonna appear here with that sign up there!
- I have busted my ass for you!
- I'm gonna bust your ass too!
I am through with it!
Take your wife and take a walk!
I'll tell these people she's not going to appear again!
- Well, go on and do it!
- Okay, take a walk, and I'll do it.
You'd do that, huh? You'd put a knife in my wife's back like that?
You're putting the knife in her back, buster. You're doing it.
I have not got time to take the sign down and put it back up again!
What are you hollerin' about?
You tryin' to embarrass me?
I'm tryin' to be heard.
Well, get these chairs off and we'll talk about it.
- I'll take care of it.
- Delbert... Where is that rat?
What are you hiding for, you little rat?
And grant us so to serve thee by day... that we may find eternal fellowship with them... through Him who died and rose again for us all,
Jesus Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
Mr. Green, it's not over.
- I'm going to find Martha.
- What for?
She owes some respect to Esther.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Barbara Jean and Haven Hamilton.
When I feel my life perishing
I call you on the phone
I always fix you up
When you get broken
'Cause every time that I got hurt
And went out of control
I knew the fears you felt
Before you spoke them
You tell me
One, I love you
Two
I'm thinkin' of you
Three
I'll never let you go
And four, I miss you
Five, I wanna kiss you
Six
I won't leave you no more
When I feel my life vanishin'
Like waves upon the sand
With nothin'to replace it
But invention
So I make my rhymes and I sing my songs
Still they don't understand
You can't find her here.
I'll find her.
- I'd sing ya
- One, I love you
Two
I'm thinkin'of you
Three
I'll never let you go

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Mama and Daddy
Raised me with lovin' care
They sacrificed
So I could have a better share
They fed me and nursed me
And sent me to school
Mama taught me how to sing
Daddy lived the Golden Rule
When I think of the children alone and afraid
Abandoned and wild like a fatherless child
I think of my mama
And how she could sing
Harmony with my daddy
Our laughter would ring
Down the highways
On the beaches
Just as far as memory reaches
I still hear Daddy singin'his old army songs
We'd laugh and count horses
As we drove along
We were young then
We were together
We could bear floods and fire
And bad weather
And now that I'm older
Grown up, on my own
I still love
Mama and Daddy best
And my Idaho home
Mama grew up
On the prairies of Kansas
She was tender and sweet
The dust and tornadoes blew 'round her
But they left her straight up on her feet
My daddy grew up on his own more or less
His mama died when he was just 11
He had seven sisters to raise him
But he dreamed of his mama in heaven
His daddy drank whiskey and had a sharp eye
He sold chicken medicine farmers would buy
Together they hunted the fields and the farms
When his daddy died my daddy rest in my mama's arms
Down the highways
On the beaches
Just as far as memory reaches
I still hear Daddy singin' his old army songs
We'd laugh and count horses
As we drove along
We were young then
We were together
We could bear floods and fire
And bad weather
And now that I'm older
Grown up, on my own
I still love
Mama and Daddy best
And my Idaho home
And now that I'm older
Grown up, on my own
I still love my Mama and Daddy best
And my Idaho home
For Mama and Daddy.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen.
- Thank you.

- Get Walker outta here!
Get off your asses!
Watch her head!
Y'all take it easy now.
This isn't Dallas, it's Nashville.
This is Nashville.
You show 'em what we're made of.
They can't do this to us here in Nashville.
Okay, everybody, sing!
Come on, somebody, sing!

Ain't gonna be nothin' left in our graves... except fly swatters with red dots on 'em.

You may say that I ain't free

That I ain't free
But it don't worry me
Let me hear you sing it
It don't worry me
No
It don't worry me
I'll be smilin', smilin'
You may say
That I ain't free
But it don't worry me
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
It don't worry me
Oh, no
It don't worry me
You may say
That I ain't free
But it don't worry me
Sing along, singin'
It don't worry me
It don't worry me
You may say
That I ain't free
But it don't worry me
It don't worry me
I'm gonna walk with my head held high
It don't worry me
Ohhh-ohh-ohh
You may say
That I ain't free
But it don't worry me
Nice and easy
It don't worry me
I'm smilin'
It don't worry me
No more cryin'
You may say
That I ain't free
But it don't
Worry
Me
I'm goin' to California
and I'll be sleepin' out every night
I'm goin' to California
but I'll be sleepin' out every night
cos' them Oklahoma women
Well, they just ain't a-treatin' me right
Well, I would rather drink muddy water
Whoa, and sleep in a hollow log
Well, I would rather drink muddy water
Whoa, and sleep in a hollow log
Than be down here in Texas
Treated like a low-down dog
Well, them California waters
They taste like cherry wine
Them California waters
Taste just like cherry wine
Yeah.
Cherry wine
Cherry wine. Goddammit, Woody!
I've got half a notion to pull up stakes and hit the road for California.
I been thinking about heading down the
Gulf of Mexico or the Rio Grande valley.
Just somewhere's where
I could grow some fruit. Peaches.
Them Indian blood peaches, with that red meat.
Shit fire, Carl! Why down there?
In California, you just plop a seed in the ground and it sprouts the very next day.
Seems I sure gotta do somethin'.
I just don't know what's gonna happen to everybody around here.
You folks sure are depressin'.
Well, I got one.
- Put a buck's worth in.
- Yes, sir!
A buck's worth of the finest gasoline in Texas.
You boys got any news?
Ain't nothin' interestin' to tell, except people are movin' out of these parts.
My name's Collister, and I been runnin' all over this here state to them fortune-tellers.
Ain't a one of 'em's told me a damn thing.
Someone tell me somethin' worth listenin' to, and I'll pay 'em a dollar.
It's been pretty dusty around here.
Hell, Woody, that ain't worth nothin', for sure!
Well, I ain't much for fortune-tellin'.
You're a inside man.
Got a big job with the oil refinery?
- How'd you know that?
- Well...
Ain't nobody else got money to waste on fortune-tellers and soda pop.
Keep goin'.
Well, them creases in between your eyebrows,
You're probably a man takes his work serious.
Always lookin' for a way to do things better.
You get 50 cents
Keep talkin'.
Well, you probably got some kind of idea.
An invention of some kind.
A big company wants to buy you out.
You get a paper dollar if you tell me when to do it.
Hell, I ain't no mind-reader.
You're the only one I ever met that didn't claim to know everything in the world.
- What's your name?
- Woody.
Woody Guthrie.
Well, Guthrie, I'll spread the word.
You're worth every penny.
Thank you kindly.
There's a nickel for the coke, a dollar for the gas.
The momma bear says:
"Ain't nobody gonna eat none of my porridge and get away with it."
So she takes up a pair of sheep shears
And she cuts every hair off the top of that little kid's head.
- Good one, daddy.
- Yeah, ain't that somethin'?
Then old Goldilocks, she just heads on back into the forest and she goes to sleep for about 20 years.
When she wakes up all her hair is growed back.
Well, looks pretty good, don't it?
It looks darn good.
But... there ain't nobody round here gonna pay you to talk to 'em.
Oh, now, that fella down at the gas station said I was the best fortune-teller he had ever seen.
That weren't nothin' but happenstance, and you know it.
You could be makin' regular money with your sign paintin', Woody, if you tried.
Just ain't no sense in harpin' on it, Mary.
It'll do no good.
You could do it. You could do 'em so special, somebody'd be sure to want 'em.
Come on in and...
...talk it over
Lay your head upon my shoulder she's my curly-headed baby come from sunny Tennessee
I ain't really a doctor.
Well, she ain't sick exactly.
Her oldest girl died of the dust pneumonia almost a week ago.
She ain't drunk a drop since.
She can't swallow.
- I don't see how i...
- some fortune-tellers have got the gift.
Healin', layin' on of hands, discernin' of spirits.
I ain't really a fortune-teller.
Poor little thing. We can't just let her waste away. Go on.
Ma'am?
Do you have faith that you'll be cured?
Well, look.
Your daughter.
Don't you believe she's up in heaven?
Well... that means you believe in god.
And if there's a god, then it was him gave you your mind.
Well, everybody knows the mind's the boss of the whole body.
It just tells all the nerves and muscles what to do.
Your arms and hands and back.
Throat.
You don't wanna die, do you? Leave your husband and your kids all alone?
Your husband wants you to talk to him, don't he? Your kids to boot.
There ain't no two ways about that!
Could I have some water here?
Away all that monkey business.
Just send a message straight down there to your throat, mouth, and... tell 'em to just swig down this here water.
Thank you.
Just try.
Just do it.
Afterwards, you tell me how dandy it was.
Now... now you swallow it. Swallow it.
That was easy.
You did it! You can do it some more.
Next couple of days, I want you two ladies to pour water down this lady's throat.
Why, you can have a water-drinkin' contest every now and then.
You just talk to her now about everything.
Talk to her.
You'll be OK.
All right.
See, you don't... you don't owe me nothin'.
Bless you, Mr. Guthrie.
Phew-ee!
I did it!
I think.
- Afternoon, Donna Jo.
- Good afternoon, Woody.
Woody? Do you and Mary have any use for a bedroom set?
It's real nice. It's called the waterfall design or somethin'.
I just hate to leave it, sat there.
Howdy, Jesse.
Uh, sure.
Sure, I guess we can do somethin' with it.
Good. There's an old chair in there too.
We just ain't got room for everything.
- Where are you folks goin'?
- California.
I don't know, it just seems like everything ran out around here... when Jesse got laid off.
Y'all are welcome to anything you find in there that you wanna use.
OK. Thank you kindly, Donna Jo.
You folks take care.
They might have jobs in that new department store in Amarillo.
Hell, pa, I ain't gonna be no shoe salesman.
- There might be somethin' else.
- It's too damn far out there anyhow.
You tell her that when she's beggin' for milk in the mornin'.
- Tell her it's too far to travel.
- Mary, it's 62 miles.
Well, maybe you could sing one of your songs to her or tell her fortune instead.
- Just don't start in on me, OK?
- It don't do no good to be carryin' on.
Times and the weather are bad enough.
It just don't do no good.
I don't mean to be startin' in.
I don't mean to always be at you, Woody.
But it just don't seem fair.
Even your brother's been out lookin' for somethin', and he's just a boy.
How about some new signs on your truck?
No, not today, Woody.
What in the hell are you doin'?
I told you I wanted white on black.
I thought you'd like red better.
Shows up from a mile away.
I asked for white on black and you give me this red bitch thing?
Was you plannin' on gettin' paid for this?
- I was plannin' on it.
- Well, just plan away, Guthrie.
What am I supposed to do with this red bitch anyways?
Why don't you fold it five ways and stick it where the sun don't shine?
I'll tell you what else I don't need.
I don't need none of your lip neither!
Ain't you kids got nothin' better to do than lollygag around here?
She's my curly-headed baby used to sit on daddy's knee she's my curly-headed baby come from sunny Tennessee and I'm gonna tell you
'bout these women
I'm gonna tell you what they do lay their head upon your shoulder flirt around... did you really write that song about me?
Sure. Sure it's about you. Damn right.
Curly-headed lady... remember what you asked me?
It hasn't been outta my mind for a second.
- I don't care.
- Don't care about what?
If we do.
- Do what?
- You know.
Come on.
Guess this town ain't entirely dead yet.
I don't know if you knew it or not, but you lookin' at an insane man.
Well... why don't you take off a couple of sweaters and sit down?
I really am insane.
Well, hell... hell, so am i. Off and on.
I heard tell about you in the next town and thought I'd better come.
I been in the insane asylum twice.
You have?
Maybe I better watch out, havin' you around the place.
I wasn't crazy when they sent me there, but then I beat up them two guards and... now I'm a-here, and even if they get me pretty quick,
I wanted to tell you
I got newsreels in my head.
- Newsreels?
- Yeah.
Since I was a kid. And my momma always told me I was crazy.
They just never stop.
What kind of newsreels?
That the boom is over, and the weeds are blowin' out, and the dust storms are gettin' darker, and there's people fightin' and killin' and there's kids sick.
Ain't nothin' wrong with your head.
I see these shapes and designs, and I see how to build roads better, and... them your brushes?
Sure. Yeah.
I'm... kind of a painter.
I sure wish I could sit down and paint all them pictures I see.
Sometimes I think I could spend for ever just paintin' and paintin' all them pictures.
Well... why don't you just take these?
Take 'em? I ain't got no money.
You don't need no money.
Just take 'em. I got plenty more.
Take some of this paint here.
Take those ideas and... then find yourself someplace where... where nobody'll bother you.
And just put those things down.
Just put those things down on paper.
You know?
Now bow to the person.
Now bow to the corner.
Join hands to the left.
Do-si-do!
Whoo-hoo!
- Dust storm!
- Dust storm's comin'!
Better get on home, Woody.
- You better get inside, Woody.
- OK.
Looks like things ain't gonna be too pleasurable around here.
- It's gonna be a real big 'un.
- Can I help you?
I got it.
Let's move the couch, pa.
Y'all's gonna ruin them things in this dust.
A little dirt won't hurt.
If this train rides me right
I'll be home Saturday night
Cos I'm 900 miles from my home
And I hate to hear that lonesome whistle blow
It's that long lonesome train whistlin' down
Pawn you my gold diamond ring
Mornin', Jimmy.
Mornin', Woody.
Well... got any more dances lined up?
Ain't heard of none.
What about that place over at Cartersville?
They was givin' a dance a month.
Yeah. Used to.
Yeah... well... take her easy, Jimmy.
- Let me give you a push.
- All right there, Woody.
- What do you think it is, Joe?
- I don't know, Woody.
- It's just dust.
- Thanks a lot, though.
It's dust, that's what it is.
Bye, Woody.
Seems like things just ain't goin' so good around here.
Not the way they's goin'.
Hi, honey.
Hi, honey.
See you later, Woody.
- Mornin'.
- Get down! Get down, boy!
Get down!
- This train goin' to California?
- It's goin' in that direction.
Can't ask for more than that.
- You boys are gonna catch this train?
- Yeah.
Mind if I ride along?
No.
How come we're sittin' here so long?
Oh.
Welcome aboard, boys.
Welcome, cowboy.
Mind movin' over a little bit there, friend?
Much obliged.
- My name's Guthrie.
- Slim Snedeger.
- Slim.
- That there's "po" Steve.
- Howdy, Steve.
- I'm crippled whitey.
- Whitey.
- Crippled whitey, huh?
Crippled whitey is a fight-spotter.
- A fight-spotter?
- Yeah.
I can spot a fist fight on the street three blocks before I come to it.
I can spot a gang fight an hour before it happens.
That way, I tip off the boys and they know how to lay their bets.
You got a fight spotted now, whitey?
I got a whopper.
When's it gonna happen?
- Not more than ten minutes.
- Ah, bullshit!
You watch your tongue, you young jackass, or I'll tear you apart.
Hey, whitey, one doesn't start up by itself, you're gonna whip up one of your own?
When it starts, I'll be sure to bust a box over your head, fella.
Cantankerous, ain't he?
Yeah.
But it be he's like that sometimes.
Ridin' these boxcars and things can make you meaner than 52 rattlesnakes.
Beats walkin', though.
Don't it?
Hey!
Don't push me out!
Whitey! Let me go!
Hey, whitey!
Whitey... hey, we're slowin' down.
Let's jump off this son of a bitch.
- Jump?
- Jump!
- Go ahead, jump!
- Wait a minute.
And when you hit the ground, be on your feet. That way, you won't break your ass.
Come on.
Come on up here.
What's wrong?
My brushes. Damn, I lost my brushes.
You gonna lose your ass. You're hangin' halfway between heaven and hell.
Come on up here.
Let's move on down the car there.
- Damn!
- Let's move on down.
Them was about the best brushes money could buy.
You a artist?
I was hopin' to pick up some money paintin' signs on the way.
I'm pretty good at sign paintin'.
Sign painter, huh?
I expect you gonna do all right in California.
Know why?
Cos they puttin' up signs and buildings and everything out there.
- You been?
- Who, me? Nah.
But I heard a heap of talk about it.
They tell me, California's the place for some real nice livin'.
That's what I hear.
What are you gonna do when you get there?
Well...
Whoo!
Well, first thing I'm gonna do is take me a long look at that pacific ocean, cos I been wantin' to see that booger all my life.
Then I expect I'll ease on down to one of them fruit orchards and get me a job, pickin' fruit.
They tell me fruit is just beggin' to be picked out there.
You know what I mean?
You drop a seed in the ground, and you blink your eye, and you got yourself a tree bustin' with fruit.
Yeah?
Everything a man needs, right out there in California.
- Know what I mean?
- Everything a man needs?
Yep.
Let's check 'em, boys.
Shit! We comin' into Acomita.
Come on outta there, you yahoos.
Come on outta there now, dammit!
- Let's go!
- Get outta there, woman.
- No!
- Pull her out.
Hey, you son of a bitch!
OK, boys.
Poor bastard. Ice didn't help this one.
Smells like he's been in there for a week.
You haven't been takin' full advantage of the railroad facilities.
We want you to ride in full comfort, so we're gonna put you inside, where you can stretch out your legs and rest your heads back on doilies.
Wouldn't that be nice?
- How much money you got?
- A dollar, fifty. I don't know.
He can ride all the way to Holden on that.
Write him up a ticket.
How much you got?
Don't hear nothin' jinglin', don't feel nothin' foldin'.
Boy, you appear to be a vagrant.
We have a curfew on vagrants.
Or didn't you know that?
I don't believe I did. When is it?
Every hour, on the hour.
Get on your hands and knees, sonny.
I could shoot you in the hand if I wanted.
Or in the thigh, in the soft part.
Or I could take you out in them weeds after everybody's gone.
Agh!
Your mother'd wait a long time for those letters you promised to write.
Come on, move on.
Let's get aboard. Come on.
Keep it movin'.
The rest of you, get your ass down the road.
Come this way again, gentlemen, and it'll be 30 days. 30 big 'uns.
Move it out!
So long, Guthrie!
See you in California!
Take it easy, slim!
But take it!
Howdy, pastor.
My name is Guthrie.
I... well, have you got any work I could do for just a small meal of some kind?
Well, sir, I would do anything to earn it.
Son, I've been in the service all my life.
I've seen thousands of men like you, who go to work for a meal.
However, at this moment there isn't any work to be done.
Therefore, if I were to feed you, it would be an act of charity.
Which may be all right for the moment, but could cause harm in the long run.
You seem to have retained your pride and your dignity, since you didn't ask outright for a free meal.
And that's to your credit.
But to answer your question, there's no work to be done.
And, therefore, you can't earn a meal.
Good luck, son.
We been all over. Niagara falls,
Washington DC, New Orleans, Chicago.
Spent a couple of weeks this past winter in Miami Beach.
- Must have been real interestin'.
- You bet it was.
Meetin' different people, seein' all the sights, goin' to the unusual restaurants.
I found out somethin' about eatin' on my trip.
- Really? What was that?
- The more you eat, the more you shit.
A hard-workin' man and brave he said to the rich
"give your goods to the poor" and they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
Jesus was a man, a carpenter by hand, his followers, true and brave one dirty little coward named Judas Iscariot laid Jesus Christ in his grave put your money away, Guthrie.
It's on the house. You really sing great.
You know the one I like the best? The one you sing about that dead cowboy guy.
I like it. It's good.
I wrote that song especially. Just for you.
In a pig's ass you did, Guthrie.
Just as he's walkin', a man is talkin'.
To who's he talkin'?
The man who's walkin'.
Why is he talkin'?
To keep on walkin'.
Keep on walkin'.
Walkin' and talkin'.
Talkin' and walkin'.
Walkin' and talkin'.
Talkin' and walkin'.
Whoo-ee! California!
Hey, take a look at that. California!
Everything a man needs, out there.
- Yee-ha!
- Yes, sir, the California state line.
- What's goin' on?
- Looks like some kind of hold-up.
Maybe a accident or somethin'.
Accident, hell!
They're turnin' people back.
What's goin' on?
They're checkin' us out, to see if we got any money.
Gotta have $50 to get across the border.
- Yeah, in cash.
That's right. Los Angeles police came out here and set up this blockade.
- We that close to Los Angeles?
- Yeah, about 300 miles.
Jesus!
What are you gonna do?
Ain't no sense in waitin' in line, just to get shoved back.
I might as well turn back right now.
You comin'?
No. I reckon there's more than one way to get across the border, if you don't have a family taggin' along.
Look... why don't you take this?
It ain't no $50, but you got them kids an' all.
Thanks. I appreciate that, friend.
Maybe we'll both be millionaire's sons next time we meet each other.
- Maybe so.
- I hope so anyway.
- Take care.
- Thank you kindly for the ride.
Howdy.
Hey.
Hey, why don't you come over and share my bed?
Come on.
Sure.
- Thanks, mister.
- I can't stand chatterin' teeth.
Better watch yourself, cos when she gets here, she's gonna be movin' like a turpentined cat.
You sure as you know what you're doin'?
Them guys won't do nothin' once she's movin'.
Get us into la 'fore you know it.
Ain't this a son of a bitch?
I never seen a train take off... you got him.
That is about as clean as this wall is gonna get.
Did you get right on top there?
- I did. Where's my chilli?
- It was very greasy over there.
- What's your name?
- Woody.
Yah, Woody!
Yes, sir! Best chilli in the city.
Goodbye, fellas.
Best in the world... as far as I'm concerned.
- Damn!
- Here, have some onion and crackers.
Put lots of onion in it.
Tastes good that way.
Look at this mess, huh?
Just one bowl of chilli and a lot of mess.
You know where a fella can get a job hereabouts?
- You just come in town?
- Mm-hm. This mornin'.
You better go home.
A chilli and crackers!
- Deadhead.
- Push it down.
- You mean let it down?
- You know what I mean.
That's as far as it'll go down.
If I let it down, it won't...
- I can't even lift the thing.
- It won't go on the hub.
It won't go. You gotta have it up.
Would you like to just do this yourself?
Looks like a mighty stubborn tyre.
Just like everything else.
- Be glad to help.
- We'd sure appreciate it.
Yeah.
- This wheel's bent.
- Bent?
Seems like everything in California's bent.
I hope we find somethin' in this place.
Yeah.
She just needs milk real soon.
We'll be OK.
What the hell's goin' on here?
How come all these people are livin' like this?
It ain't no different.
It's the goddamn same as all the rest.
Growers, they need three or four hundred workers.
They put out leaflets and posters and advertise for a thousand, and 1200 showed up.
They got the first ones that get here crammed inside them shacks over there.
They're workin' pretty steady.
All the rest of us are sittin' on our asses, hopin' they're gonna need extra workers.
Hell, I worked three days in the last two weeks.
The wages, they doesn't buy... the wages...
I don't know, makes me sick just talkin' about it.
What are we gonna do, then?
We got nothin' left.
Ain't got no choice.
You're welcome to spend the night in the truck, if you want.
Seems to me somethin' ought to be done about this.
There's nothin'.
There's always somethin'.
There's been some talk about formin' a union, goin' on strike.
But... hell, Woody, not many people can afford to miss a day's work.
No.
By the time they call on us to pick, we're more than happy to work for four cents a bushel.
What'd you say if I took this little old guitar into town?
Maybe I can pick up a dime or two?
You comin' back?
Got no place to sleep,
'cept in your truck.
Hell, yeah, go ahead and take it.
I ain't in too much of a mood to use it anyway.
Thanks.
See you later.
Tell you what, I'll paint you a new sign out there for a bowl of that soup.
Well, I tell you what, it's not necessary.
The food is free.
Well, suppose I said
I don't want no free food?
Well, suppose I said we don't have any other kind?
Well, I guess... I guess I'd have to say
"please pass the soup."
Do you play?
Yep.
I studied piano.
Years ago. I never had the patience.
- That so?
- Yes.
Would you really paint us a sign?
- For food?
- For a favour.
I'd have to think about that.
Uh... we don't have any paint here right now.
Then how would I paint a sign?
I could bring some tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I'll see if I can come back.
Thanks for the soup.
Red and white paint is pretty nice.
Red and white.
Well, I was down in the henhouse on my knees
I thought I heard a chicken sneeze it was only a rooster sayin' his prayers thankin' his gods for the hens upstairs just takin' it easy lady, what'd you say?!
Hit him, bill!
Quiet down!
Now, we need 30 more pickers for today.
Quiet! Quiet down!
We're payin' four cents a bushel.
Four cents.
Line up over here by the gate in single file.
Stop pushin' over there!
Keep on shovin', and we won't take anybody.
Cheapskate!
Bastards.
Goddamn bastards!
- That's all they're takin', them 30 people?
- That's all they ever take.
Well, hell, why do you stay here? One of them other camps may be hirin' more.
It don't make no difference.
I mean, they all work the same.
It's the fourth one we've been to, and... they's all alike.
All of 'em is bastards.
That's beautiful!
- I had a terrible time with the one I did.
- Yeah, it looked like you did.
I really appreciate it.
Can I get you something to eat?
Not here.
What do you mean, not here?
Well, you could fix me dinner at your place.
No, I couldn't do that.
Why not? You got a man?
No. My husband died.
- Well, what's your name?
- Pauline.
Mine's Woody.
- How about next Sunday?
- Woody, I'm not gonna fix you dinner.
Why not?
Because I just can't.
Yeah, course you can't.
- I can't say as I blame you.
- That's not the reason.
Well, it's a pretty good reason.
Listen, give it a couple of hours before you handle it, OK?
Way down in Columbus, Georgia wanna be back in Tennessee go and leave me if you want to never let me cross your mind if in your heart you love another leave, little darlin', I don't mind thinkin' about my blue-eyed sally pretty little gal that I left behind way down in Columbus stockade wanna go back to Tennessee way down in Columbus, Georgia wanna be back in Tennessee
- it's Ozark!
- Who's Ozark?
- Ozark blue sings on the radio.
- Sometimes he comes to entertain us.
- Hey, Ozark.
- Hi, how are ya, sis?
I swear, you get prettier every day.
Hey, Jed, look over there and see what
I brought for you guys. Open that door.
You get to eat it without pickin' it for a change.
I can see that you haven't been doin' like I said and organisin'.
You're still lettin' those bosses pay you nothin' for bustin' your behinds in those fields all day.
Now, the only way I'll do any singin' today is if we all get together and shout "union".
Now, one, two, three... union!
That was pitiful.
Now, we're gonna try it once more, and if more of you don't join in, I'm leavin'.
Ah!
We're gonna try it again, and I wanna hear more of you joinin' in.
- Now, one, two, three...
- union!
All right.
Now, it wasn't perfect... but I reckon it's a start.
Let's have a little pickin' and singin'.
Yeah!
Long-haired preachers come out every night try to tell us what's wrong and what's right but when asked about somethin' to eat they will answerin' voices so sweet:
You're gonna eat by and by when you learn how to cook and to fry chop some wood, it'll do you good there'll be pie in the sky when you die that's a lie!
There'll be starvation... hi, neighbours! Come on over!
Come on over.
Now, I want you to listen to this verse.

This sort of thing happen every time you come out to entertain folks?
Sure seems like it. As long as I'm gettin' those goons riled up, I'm doin' my job.
I'll tell you, those boys don't seem to like you too much.
Yeah? Well, they didn't seem to like you too much either.
I wasn't even tryin'.
Maybe you ought to start.
- Start what?
- Tryin'.
Tryin' what?
You sure as hell don't look like much.
How do you sound?
- Makes me happy.
- Wait till you hear him, Mr. Locke.
OK, Guthrie, let's hear something.
I'd like to sing a song about the place...
Guthrie, let's just get on with it, please.
...place where I grew up. It's called "in those Oklahoma hills where I was born".
Many a month has come and gone since I wandered from my home in those Oklahoma hills where I was born many a page of life has turned many a lesson I have learned and I feel like in those hills I still belong way down yonder on the Indian nation
Ridin' my pony on the reservation in those Oklahoma hills where I was born way down yonder on the Indian nation the cowboy's life is my occupation in those Oklahoma hills where I was born well, as I stand here in la many a mile...
OK, Guthrie. We'll give you a try.
- ...my pony through the draw
- uh, Guthrie!
Where the oak and blackjack trees kiss the playful prairie breeze and I feel...
Guthrie! You have the job.
Way down yonder on the Indian nation
Ridin' my pony on the reservation in those Oklahoma hills where I was born way down yonder on the Indian nation the cowboy's life is my occupation in those Oklahoma hills where I was born here's an advance, Guthrie.
I... I want you to go out and get a set of decent clothes.
And... and show up here next Thursday!
At 20 bucks a week.
Yahoo!
Since I'm almost respectable now, maybe you can ask me to your house for dinner.
- That's not why I didn't ask you.
- Well, what is why?
I don't know you.
Well...
I think I'd like chicken, with dressin'.
So go to sleep, my weary hobo let the ton drift slowly by and can't you hear the steel rails hummin'?
That's the hobo's lullaby folks, we got a real treat for you tonight.
We got an old boy from Oklahoma who not only sings songs, he writes 'em.
And his name is Woodrow Wilson Guthrie, but we just call him Woody.
And his song is called
"I ain't got no home".
Well, I ain't got no home
I'm just ramblin' around
I'm a hard-workin' ramblin' man and I go from town to town police make it hard, hard everywhere I go and I ain't got no home in this world any more
I used to work for shares
seems like I was always poor
I laid my crops right at the banker's door
my wife took up and died
on the cabin floor
I ain't got no home any more
- Howdy, Ozark.
- Hi, neighbours!
- Can I talk to you for just a minute?
- You sure can.
If I had to drag my tail home with 80 cents in my pocket after workin' all day like this,
I'd begin to wonder if somethin' wasn't wrong.
It'd be nice if you had enough money to put food on the table at the end of the day.
Did you ever stop to wonder if you could do something about the way you live?
Because you can, friends
Woody!
I'm gonna get you!
Get outta the valley!
You sons of bitches, stay out of this valley!
You people, get back to work!
Union! Union! Union!
I been ridin' in fast rattlers
I thought you knowed
I been ridin' in flat wheelers way down the road
I been ridin' in blind passengers, dead enders, kickin' up cinders
I been havin' some hard travellin', Lord
I been walkin' that Lincoln Highway
I thought you knowed
I been kickin' that 66 way down the road
I got a heavy load and a worryin' mind
I'm lookin' for a woman that's hard to find
I been havin' some hard travellin', Lord
- Whoo!
- All right! Let's hear it here.
Now, the farm workers need your help.
I was expectin' the mayor! I thought this was city hall there for a second.
Come on in, Woody.
How much you get paid for workin' at that place anyhow?
I don't get paid.
I'm a volunteer.
Excuse me, but could I ask you a question?
Sure. What?
Well, don't you get embarrassed ever?
"Embarrassed ever" about what?
Well, don't you get just a little bit embarrassed about havin' so much, when so many people got nothin'?
Well, I don't think "embarrassed".
I am very sorry that there are so many people who have nothing.
Sure.
Course you are.
Sorry don't get the hay in.
So you ladle 'em up the soup and dish out a little charity?
Well, we're not all as gifted as you are.
Some of us just do the best we can.
Pauline, let me tell you somethin'.
When i... well, when I was on the road,
I met a lot of different kinds of people.
There was bums and freeloaders.
There was families that was torn apart.
And poor people that just was achin' for some kind of work.
And men that are just tryin' to get somewhere. Anywhere.
They all got somethin' in common, that every one of them had somethin' to give me.
Then you meet some man that's got some money, and he'll be... tied up and anxious.
The human thing is just gone.
It's just gone, cos he's afraid.
Afraid that he's gonna lose somethin'.
He's afraid to smile, cos somebody's gonna swipe his teeth out his mouth.
You don't believe that just because a person has money that he completely loses touch?
Because that's wrong.
I feel as alive and human as anyone else.
That don't give me nothin'.
What the hell am I supposed to give you, Woody?
Just why did you come here?
I just liked the way you looked, and...
I thought you had possibilities.
Possibilities.
Well, what must you think now?
I think I'm lookin' at a... rich person.
So?
So, you're the only one that's ever looked back.
You know, Samson went out walkin'... and slew a lion with his bare hands.
But it took a pretty woman to show Samson he was just a lamb come on, we haven't got all day.
I have a reputation to uphold.
If anybody catches us here, they're gonna be a little bit angry at us.
Doesn't have to look like
Rembrandt, did it?
- Next time I'm paintin' the sign.
- It ain't bad.
There ain't no sense in doin' it if somebody can't read it.
- Might as well paint signs white.
- You never been caught.
I wouldn't wanna be caught by them guys with a sign that looked as awful as that.
B- e-l-l-l-e.
There we go. S.
OK.
"Come on..." you can read that.
Come on, let's go.
Good evenin', y'all. This is Woody, talkin' to you while Ozark's catchin' his breath.
I'd like to dedicate a song tonight to all you folks sittin' out there in them fruit-pickin' camps.
I know you're squattin' there, hungry, either too darn hot or too darn cold, and wonderin' if you should have ever left home.
This here's for y'all.
If we don't organise, if we don't unite in our struggle, those growers will have us on our knees for ever!
- Let's strike.
- We gotta work.
- We gotta strike!
- But our families? How are we gonna eat?
There are donations of food and clothing coming from all over the state.
- We don't want charity, we want jobs.
- Listen. Listen to me!
There ain't nobody gonna get any damn jobs until you start to listen to us.
- You're nothin' but commies!
- Sit down!
- You sit down!
- No.
Now's not the time to sit down, but to stand up for your rights.
Sit down and shut up.
Please listen to us.
We're telling you the truth.
Hold it! Please, hold it.
Just a tune of "free red range".
There once was a union maid who never was afraid of the goons and the ginks and the company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raids
She went to the union hall when a meetin' it was called and when the company boys came round she always stood her ground
Oh, you can't scare me
I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union
Oh, you can't scare me
I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union till the day I die
Well, the union maid was wise to the tricks of the company spies
She was never gonna be fooled by the company stools
She'd always organised the guys
She always got her way when she struck for higher pay
She'd show her card to the national guard and this is what she'd say:
Oh, you can't scare me
I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union
Oh, you can't scare me
I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union till the day I die
Everybody!
Oh, you can't scare me
I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union
Oh, you can't scare me
I'm stickin' to the union
I'm stickin' to the union till the day I die
- Outside!
- Get off me.
- I said, outside!
- Get...
...I'm sti...
Excuse me.
Do you ever think of becoming a painter?
I reckon I'd get busted up doin' that just as easy as anythin' else.
I "reckon" you would.
Woody?
- Woody!
- Uh-huh?
I'm happy.
I'm really happy that I know you.
Yeah.
Yeah, what?
Yeah... I'm married.
I got a wife and I got kids.
I guess I could have lied to you before, but I can't lie to you now you're startin' to care.
I was carin' too, Pauline.
Just... bein' around you... knowin' you.
Most of this mail is favourable, Woody.
Yes, very favourable indeed.
I didn't have no idea that many people was listenin'.
Well, apparently they are.
Woody, I'm gonna give you and Memphis sue your own half-hour show, every night.
- How does that sound?
- Whoo-ee!
Now!
And, of course, that means more money too.
Say, 35 a week?
No.
- However...
- however, what?
However, you now have new sponsors, Woody.
They've insisted there be no controversial material on their programme.
So just stick to the songs that have been out and around for a while, and everything'll be fine.
Does that mean I can't do my own songs on the show?
Of course you can sing your own songs.
As long as it doesn't get anybody riled up.
That sure sounds OK with me, Mr. Locke.
Um... sure.
Guess it sounds pretty OK to me too.
Fine. And we'll start on Monday, let's say?
Operator?
I'd like to talk to Mary Guthrie in pampas, Texas.
You'll have to get a hold of Mr. Jenkins, and he'll go and get her.
It's just so good to hear your voice.
I'm gonna send you the money, and you just come on out here.
And I'll find you a little house we can live in.
Oh, sure, honey.
Just like you always talked about.
I love you.
Hey, Woody. Look at that.
- What is that?
- A field school.
- What do you think?
- Sure.
About music, the wonderful thing is you don't have to know how to play.
To make music you just sing.
You just go ahead and sing any song you wanna sing.
You can make up a song and just sing it to yourself.
You can just go ahead and sing it out screamin' loud.
You can sing about your troubles, or you can sing about your happiness.
You can sing about your teacher, or you can sing about the crop duster.
There's singin' in all of us.
You just gotta learn to let it come on out.
Well, you stick out your little hand to every woman, kid and man and you wave it up and down and howdy-do and you wave it up and down and howdy-do
I feel glad when you feel good you brighten up my neighbourhood with a do-de-di-de-de-de howdy-do, howdy-do with a howdy, ho-di, howdy, howdy-do he has every right to set down limits.
He's not gonna allow preachin' on your show.
I suppose you're right.
But they got a Sunday mornin' gospel hour every night, and he sure preaches.
That's what Locke's payin' him to do.
He's payin' you to entertain.
What would you do?
- I'd do just like he said.
- You would?
Because that's how I make my livin'.
That's how I eat.
It don't have nothin' to do with comin' out to the fields, doin' the benefits or nothin'.
You can separate it, just like that?
I can separate it, just like that.
Drop whatever you are doin' stop your work and worry too sit right down and take it easy here comes Woody and Memphis Sue you just drop a card or letter we will sing a song for you easy-goin' country people plain old Woody and Memphis Sue good evening to you all. Tonight Woody and I have 30 minutes of your favourites.
We're gonna start off with "Cimarron spoonin"'.
One, two...
I just decided to sing somethin' else.
Well, lots of folks back east they say they're leaving town most every day and they're tryin' to beat their dusty way to the California line well, across the desert sands they roll tryin' to get out of that old dust bowl and they think they're headin' for a sugar bowl, but here is what they find cos the police at port of entry say:
You're number 14,000 for today and if you ain't got do re mi, boy if you ain't got the do re mi you better go back home to beautiful Texas
Oklahoma, Georgia, Kansas,
Tennessee, South Dakota
California is the garden of Eden a paradise to live in or to see but, believe it or not, you won't find it so hot if you ain't got...
Locke talked to me, and he is ticked off.
I expected that.
Yeah, well, he said that from now on you have to make a list each week of all the songs you're plannin' on singin'.
He might as well fire me, then, cos I ain't makin' no list.
Dammit, Woody, don't mess up this job.
God knows what'll happen to you if you get... will you stop splashin' when I'm tryin' to talk to you?
You stop it too! Now, dammit, that ain't funny! Stop it!
- Ain't it somethin'?
- The whole city is somethin'.
- You've only seen a bit of it, Mary.
- You know what we ought to do?
Get a picnic together and take the girls down to the beach.
That'd be sometime else me and Mary ain't seen each other for a few months. Understand?
Oh, yeah, right.
You need some help with those?
No, I can handle it OK.
- Thanks for the ride, Ozark.
- You bet.
OK, honey, let me show you the inside.
Huh?
Come here, let me show you this.
- Oh!
- Electric.
A refrigerator!
- Let me show you the bedroom.
- I ain't finished lookin' at the kitchen.
Oh, my god.
Our own bedroom.
Oh!
Momma's pin.
Whoo-ee!
Oh, you!
Whoo-ee!
It's so pretty, Woody. It's so perfect.
To celebrate, say "whoo-ee".
No! I don't want to.
- Go ahead and do it.
- No.
Go ahead. Or I'll tickle you.
Tickle you here.
All right. Whoo-ee.
Ain't you ticklish no more?
Really do it. Come on. Come on.
OK!
Whoo-ee!
Whoo-ee!
- Hey, we have wet shoes!
- Yeah!
- I think I sounded awful.
- You were great, Sue.
- I wasn't great.
- You were.
Mr. Guthrie, excuse me.
My name's baker. I'm an agent.
I know you're working without a contract.
If you would be willing to travel a bit,
I think I could double, maybe triple, what you're earning.
- How would you do that?
- Better shows, for one thing.
I think that I could wangle you a coast-to-coast broadcast.
I mean, I know a lot of important people that I would like to talk to about you.
Well, I'll think it over.
Well, OK. I mean,
I don't wanna press you.
Why don't I come back when I've got something in the works for you?
Sure.
Mr. Guthrie, you're gonna be on your way before you know it.
Hello, baker. Woody, just a minute, please. I wanna talk to you.
Um...
I haven't seen any list yet.
- List?
- Yes.
The list of songs that you're scheduled to do next week.
Oh, yeah. I ain't... wrote it yet.
Well, I need the list, Woody, because the sponsors are insist... what the hell is that?
It's an artichoke.
An artichoke?
What do you do with it?
You eat it.
Damnedest thing I ever seen.
Don't look too appetisin', do it?
- I gets paid to pick 'em, not to eat 'em.
- I guess you are.
Bet they don't pay you much for pickin' them ugly old things either, do they?
- I don't get much.
- Do you ever think about all that stoopin'?
For just pennies?
You one of those union men? You one of these fellas talkin' about a strike?
I talk about whatever it is that works.
I got no time to talk to you, mister!
We died 'neath your trees and we died in your bushes both sides of the river we died just the same is this the best way we can grow big orchards?
Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit?
To fall dry leaves that rot on my topsoil and to be called by no name except deportees goodbye, my Juan goodbye, Rosalita
Adiós, mis amigos Jesús y Maria you won't have your names when you ride the big airplane all they will call you will be deportees
Oklahoma and Texas ain't nothin' compared to California.
That don't seem right somehow, it bein' so pretty out here.
No.
It ain't right.
It ain't right at all.
It does seem like it was easier to put up with nature and dust storms an' all than it is to put up with greed.
Yeah, I guess so.
Did you... did you ever make that list for Mr. Locke?
No, I didn't. Not yet.
- Don't he want it right away?
- I suppose he does.
It just ain't that easy for me to do.
Make up a list!
No, I guess not.
I was cleanin' yesterday, Woody.
This old man - he must have been
70 years old - he didn't have no teeth, and he wasn't wearin' no shoes.
He came to the door, beggin' for food.
I gave him some fried chicken.
His wrinkled... wrinkled old face just lit right up.
Then I started in worryin' about us.
I got real worried, Woody, askin' myself:
"My god, are we gonna be like that again two weeks from now?"
I can't help thinkin' about those bad times.
I don't want 'em to happen again.
Woody? It's me. Johnson.
Hey! It sure is!
What the hell happened to you?
Oh, we had some trouble out there.
Them owners, they sent their men chargin' into a picket line we had set up.
And they're swingin' their clubs in every direction just... they just got me.
- They did that to you?
- Yeah.
- Wow.
- There were some others, I'm afraid.
What about your family? They OK?
Yeah. Yeah, they're fine.
Fact is, I been learnin' an awful lot from that baby of mine.
- You been learnin', have you?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I been learnin'.
When that baby wants somethin', she's gonna cry and carry on somethin' awful till she gets what she's after.
Then I started thinkin' about all those thousands of people, workin' out there in the fields, never gettin' nothin' they want.
Just givin' up, never sayin' nothin'.
I don't wind up like that, Woody.
I don't wanna end up just sittin' around.
So I made up my mind that I'm just gonna speak out, just like that baby of mine.
I'm gonna let folks know what I want.
What's Liz think about all this?
She's plenty scared.
You know how women are.
She says she's proud of me.
I bet she is.
Yeah.
Anyway, Woody, what I come to tell you... is keep up your music, cos everybody's listenin'.
Well, Luther... keep on doin' the work, huh?
Woody. I want the list, and I want it right now.
That wasn't so... just a minute, please.
That wasn't so painful, was it?
"Bury me beneath the willow",
"sweet pearl"...
"long green valley"? What is that?
That's not about the San Fernando valley, or pickers, orchards or anything like that?
It's about a man that kills his sweetheart cos she's sleepin' around.
- Oh, good.
- At least, he thinks she was.
Well, that's good.
Yeah, these are fine, Woody.
Fine. Thank you.
It's a mighty hard row that these poor hands have hoed
my poor feet have travelled a hot, dusty road
from out of the old dust bowl and westward we rolled
and your deserts were hot and your mountains were cold green pastures of plenty from high desert ground from the grand coulee dam, where the water runs down this land I'll defend with my life if need be cos these pastures of plenty must always be free look on them deserts all around me you and me this land... there's a better world a-comin' tell you why there's a better world a-comin' tell you why there's a better world a-comin' by and by there's a better world a-comin' can't you see? Can't you see?
There's a better world a-comin' can't you see?
When we'll all be union and we'll all be free there's a better world a-comin' can't you see?
I'm a union man in a union war it's a union world I'm fightin' for now, there's a better world a-comin' tell you why, tell you why there's a better world a-comin' tell you why through the marchin' and the battlin' you can see the chains a-rattlin'
- what are you doin'?
- Get outta here.
I'll get out when I'm good and ready, and I ain't ready yet.
Yes, you are!
Joe, hold him!
I just been on the bum for the last few months.
Figure now I'll go to la and stay there.
Where are you from?
Shit, I think I was born in an orange grove somewhere's. I don't know.
Do your folks know where you are?
Unless they counted heads, they wouldn't even know I was missin'.
Daddy!
- Hey, Sue.
- Hi, dad.
Hey! Give me a kiss.
Daddy!
What you doin' here anyway?
And the boy scolded us, and their mothers and fathers...
- we'll eat 'em for dinner.
- Sure.
Guess who's home!
Hi, honey.
- Where've you been?
- Oh, I just had to... touch the people for a little bit, honey.
Well, darn it, Woody.
While you been out fightin' again, you may have just lost that job.
Mr. Locke's been callin' every day, and he's upset.
And that agent fella's been callin', and he's mad.
- To hell with them.
- You can't say that. You can't say that!
Mr. Locke is paying you better than ever before. You can't say to hell with all that.
That don't mean nothin'.
Well, if it don't, what does?
I know it ain't me and the kids.
You don't think nothin' about runnin' off whenever you get the urge.
Oh, Mary... don't even talk like that.
Now, I truly care about you and the kids. I truly care.
That sure ain't the way it seems.
You're spendin' your whole life tryin' to fix the world.
- You don't do nothin' to help our family.
- Hell!
I brought you out here to California!
And then you left!
Hell, Mary, it's just that i... can't seem to... just can't stand to sit still.
I always feel like I ought to be somewhere's else. Anywhere's else!
Well, what about me?
What am I supposed to do?
Sit, and wait, while you are off gallivantin' around the country?!
Am i?!
Am I supposed to just sit, and worry if the kids are gonna have a daddy, cos maybe you got your head bashed in?
Am i? Am i?!
Supposed to sit home and pray you ain't wanderin' around, bleedin' to death?
You keep goin' like this and our family's gonna be beggin' them growers for work.
- Dammit...
- We'll be beggin'!
- Stop your talkin'.
- It won't make anything better!
- I said, stop talkin'!
- I ain't through!
Just one more word, now, just one more word... are you sure you haven't got somethin' else on your mind? You positive?!
Oh, now... ah...
- Mary...
- no.
So help me, if anyone else had walked out on me, they'd be out on the street.
I'm gonna give you one more chance.
Just one. But I want you to be responsible.
No, I won't take off my buckskin gloves they're made of Spanish leather
I'll go my way from day to day and sing with the Gypsy Davy and sing it with the Gypsy Davy that song with the Gypsy Davy and lovin' that Gypsy Davy
I'd like to dedicate this next song to all you pickers out there, with your hearts achin' and bellies growlin'.
And I'd like you to remember that if you feel like singin' along with me, and you don't know all the words, just go ahead and make up some of your own.
I'm sure you all got plenty to say about the way things are.
You continually force me to treat you like a child.
What do I say to get through to you?
You could tell me you don't like my singin'.
That is not up to me, Woody.
There are sponsors.
- Now, if it were up to me...
- then you do like my singin'?
That isn't the point! I'm trying to tell you something. There are sponsors.
They pay for the right to hear what they wanna hear.
Maybe you like some of my singin' but not all?
Woody, please! Just listen to me.
They feel that that kind of material...
I like my singin' too much to take orders from some fat little squirt doesn't even know his own mind!
Well, then there's not much to discuss, is there?
You want the job, or do you not want the job?
Do you think I can't replace you?
In ten minutes? In five?
I don't need this place.
I can sing on the street.
Well, get the hell outta my office!
I don't need you.
I can sing while I'm walkin'.
Woody!
- What the hell are you up to?
- I ain't in no mood for talkin'.
- You got your butt fired, didn't you?
- Damn right, I did.
- What did he tell you?
- Nothin'.
- He didn't say anything about baker?
- Who?
- That agent.
- Hell, no.
No, he wouldn't. You see, baker's been callin' you about 20 times a day.
He is startin' to get things rollin' for you, Woody.
Rollin' how? What do you mean?
He's got you all signed up to do a spot for CBS, coast to coast!
- Coast to coast?
- That's right.
- Damn! Coast to coast.
- And that ain't all.
He's got an audition lined up, some big hotel downtown.
A show like that could bring you in another 100 a week.
Damn!
Shoot, Woody, you're gonna wind up singin' to this whole damn country.
We got us some celebratin' to do.
Damn! Coast to coast?!
Whoo-hoo!
Come on, Woody.
Jesus!
Here comes Santa Claus!
Where is everybody?
Whoo-hoo! It's everybody's birthday!
And there ain't nobody gettin' any older!
Mary's gone.
She took the kids.
Gone back to pampa.
Oh, hell!
You don't think she left cos you got fired?
She left before that.
She always leaves the time on a note.
4:30, yesterday afternoon.
Damn woman, anyhow.
Who the hell cares what time you write a note?
Huh?
I'm in the mood for love simply because you're near me funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love heaven was... there's steady money here at the grove.
I'm gonna book you here for six weeks.
Then I'm gonna book you in every top hotel and club in the country.
You gotta watch your step, though, at CBS.
You gotta be careful about the material you select.
Thank you. Thank you.
We already have a ballad singer.
- I think we should see him.
- Who? Guthrie?
I heard good reports about Guthrie.
Mr. Guthrie.
It's a mighty hard row that these poor hands have hoed my poor feet have travelled a hot, dusty road on the edge of your city you'll see us there and then
I come with the dust and I'm gone...
Mr. Guthrie. That's enough.
...with the wind that's enough, Mr. Guthrie.
Thank you!
- You have a really nice quality
- he's wonderful.
- I told you I heard good reports.
- What kind of angle could we use?
Western?
What about a simple hillbilly presentation?
Big overalls, maybe a straw hat.
Stick him in front of a haystack.
That might work. We could get the Benton brothers to back him up.
I think so.
Let's use him as a lead into... excuse me.
While you folks are talkin' to each other, which way is the bathroom?
Oh. Out the door, turn right, first door on the right.
Woody!
This is a big chance for you.
Can you afford to throw it away?
- Where are you goin'?!
- Out of this damn hotel.
I got no desire to sing to folks that's drinkin' martinis and stuffin' themselves full of lamb chops.
But the CBS broadcast?
You gonna throw that away too?
Standin' in a radio station, doin' what they tell me to do, ain't my idea of havin' fun.
Woody, stop a minute and let's talk it out.
This is important.
It ain't nothin', Ozark.
I'll tell you what's important.
The worst thing that can happen is to cut yourself loose from the folks.
Where the hell are you goin'?!
- Just tell me where you're goin'!
- Hell, I don't know.
Europe, New York, China...
New York.
- Maybe I'll come. When are you leavin'?
- Now!
Why do you have to go at everything like you're killin' snakes with a hoe?
- And why New York?
- Why the hell not?
It's got people, don't it? It's got unions.
Besides, I can sing while I'm walkin' there.
This land is your land
this land is my land
- so long, Woody!
- From California to the New York island
from the Redwood forest to the Gulf stream waters
I hate a song that makes you think you're not any good.
I hate a song that makes you think you're just born to lose. Bound to lose.
No good to nobody.
No good for nothin'.
Because you're either too old or too young or too fat or too thin
or too ugly or too this or too that.
Songs that run you down or songs that poke fun at you,
on account of your bad luck or your hard travellin'.
I am out to fight those kind of songs
to my very last breath of air and my last drop of blood.
I'm out to sing songs and to prove to you that this is your world,
even if it's kicked you pretty hard and knocked you down for a dozen loops.
No matter how hard it's run you down or rolled over you,
no matter what colour, what size you are, how you're built,
I am out to sing the songs that'll make you take pride in yourself.
Nobody livin' can ever stop me as I go walkin' down the freedom highway nobody livin' can make me turn back this land was made for you and me
I roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps
to the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
and all around me a voice was sounding:
This land was made for you and me
When the sun came shining and I was strolling
and the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
as the fog was lifting a voice was chanting:
This land was made for you and me
nobody living can ever stop me
as I go walking down the freedom highway
nobody living can make me turn back
this land was made for you and me
I've sung this song but I'll sing it again
all the people I've met, the places I've been
some of the troubles that bothered my mind
and a lot of good people that I've left behind
singin'so long, it's been good to know you
so long, it's been good to know you
so long, it's been good to know you
What a long time since I've been home
and I gotta be driftin' along
Tom Joad got out of that old McCallister pen
it was there that he got his parole
after four long years on a man-killin' charge
Tom Joad came walkin' down the road
poor boy
Tom Joad came walkin' down the road
tell me, what were their names?
Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
What were their names?
Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
I'm blowin' down this old dusty road
I'm blowin' down this old dusty road
I'm blowin' down this old dusty road
and I ain't gonna be treated this way

roll on, Columbia, roll on
your power is turnin' our darkness to dawn
so roll on, Columbia, roll on
I been havin' some hard travellin'
I thought you knowed
I been havin' some hard travellin' way down the road
I been havin' some hard travellin', hard ramblin', hard gamblin'
I been havin' some hard travellin', Lord
as I went walkin' down the ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
and all around me
a voice keeps sayin'
this land was made for you and me
as I went walkin'
I saw a sign there
and on the sign it says "no trespassing"
but on the other side it didn't say nothin'
that side was made for you and me
this land is your land
this land is my land
from California to the New York island
from the Redwood forest...
OK?
OK.
- OK?
- Yeah, l'll start again.
Same slate still running.
Cutthroat.
Keep running. lt'll get better.
Start all over again. Same slate.
OK, Rick, what's the game?
- Cutthroat.
- The object is?
The object is to keep your balls on the table and knock everybody else's off.
You're still there, huh?
We're gonna do one more song and that's it.
All right.
And happy Thanksgiving.
' Well, baby, don't you do it
' Don't do it
' Don't you break my heart
' Please, don't do it, don't you break my heart
' My biggest mistake was loving you too much
' And letting ya know
' Now you got me where you want me
' And you won't let me go
' lf my heart was made of glass
' Well, then you'd surely see
' Heartaches and misery
' You been causin' me

' You know l try to do my best
' Don't do it
' Don't you break my heart
' Please don't do it
' Don't you break my heart
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Good night. Goodbye.
(Robertson) OK, look.
We've been together 16 years.
- (Martin Scorsese) Who?
- Who?
The Band.
- You want me to plug that in?
- Let's do it again.
The Band has been together 16 years.
Together on the road.
We did eight years in bars, dives, dance halls.
Eight years of concerts and stadiums, arenas.
We gave our final concert,
The Band's final concert, and we called it The Last Waltz.
Why was it held in San Francisco, in Winterland, when you guys have been on the road for 16 years?
Winterland was the first place that the band played as The Band.
Some friends showed up and helped us take it home.
Not just friends. They're more than that.
Would you ask me that again?
They weren't just friends. They weren't just friends who came in to say hello.
You know what l mean? Get that fly!
No. They were more than just friends. l feel they're probably some of the greatest influences on music on a whole generation.
We wanted it to be more than just a concert. We wanted it to be a celebration.
Celebration of a beginning or an end?
Beginning of the beginning of the end of the beginning.
- (Levon Helm) Good evening.

' Yodel yodel yodel oooh lt was kind of... We didn't know where we were going, we didn't know what it was.
But, for some reason, it seemed like a good idea.
We got to this place, a joint, in Fort Worth, Texas. lt was burned out, bombed out. The roof wasn't even on the place any more.
And that's when they decided to call it the Skyline Lounge.
And we got there and set up and...
A big place.
Huge. Bar, way at the back and a big dance floor.
- Real old.
- So we set up the first night.
We go down to the place to play.
We go in and, in this huge place, there's about three people in the audience.
A one-armed go-go dancer and a couple of drunk waiters.
- A couple here, a couple there.
- Somebody fires a tear gas...
And a fight starts.
There isn't enough people in the place to get angry.
And we found out a few years later that it was Jack Ruby's club.

16 years ago, when we started, we started with a guy you might have heard of.
We'd like to start with him.
The Hawk! Ronnie Hawkins!
He called me up and l said
''Sure l'd like a job.
What does it mean? What do l do?''
He said ''You won't make much money but you'll get more pussy than Sinatra.''
' Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley, have you heard?
' Baby's gonna buy me a mockingbird
Whooooo!
Big time, Bill! Big time! Big time!

And the week went on and it was a little depressing.
And it was especially depressing cos we didn't have any money at all. No dough.
(Danko) At one point, we had no more food money. lt got to the point where, coming from
Canada, we had these overcoats, big overcoats with pockets and everything, and we had a little routine.
We'd go to the shopping centre, all together.
- But l stayed home, right?
- No, you didn't. l got the cigarettes. l turned the cigarette machine upside down and got everybody some cigarettes.
- Yeah, but that was on the...
- You got me some baloney.
We'd go to the supermarket and a couple of people would buy a couple of loaves of bread, cos that was about the cheapest thing you could get.
And the rest of us would be carousing the aisles, stuffing baloney. lt'd be time to leave, the guy with the loaves would go to the checkout and we'd say ''We'll meet you at the car. You take the bread out.''
- Ya'll come back!
- And with these overcoats...
' And it makes no difference where l turn
' l can't get over you and the flame still burns
' And it makes no difference, night or day
' The shadow never seems to fade away
' And the sun don't shine any more
' And the rains fall down on my door
' Well, these old love letters
' Well, l just can't keep them
' Cos, like the gambler says
' Read 'em and weep
' And the dawn don't rescue me no more
' Without your love l have nothing at all
' Like an empty hall, it's a lonely fall
' Since you've been gone, it's a losing battle
' Stampeding cattle they rattle the walls
' And the sun don't shine any more
' And the rains fall down on my door
' Well, l love you so much
' And it's all l can do
' Just to keep myself from telling you
' That l never felt so alone before

That's what The Last Waltz is. l mean, 16 years on the road.

Well, we were The Hawks.
Everything was fine.
We were sailing along.
And all of a sudden, one day, The Hawks meant something else altogether. lt was right in the middle of that whole psychedelia.
''Chocolate Subway''. ''Marshmallow
Overcoat''. Those kind of names.
When we were working with Bob Dylan and we moved to Woodstock, everybody referred to us as The Band.
He called us The Band. Our friends and neighbours called us The Band.
And we started out with The Crackers.
We tried to call ourselves The Honkies.
Everybody kind of backed off from that, you know? lt was too straight.
So we decided just to call ourselves The Band.

A dream come true.
Fascinating. Scary.
Kind of hard to take the first time.
You have to go there about two or three times before you can fall in love with it.
But that happens eventually.
We stayed at the Times Square Hotel on 42nd Street.
The title of the hotel, it sounded like it was conveniently located in midtown Manhattan.
What did we know? We came out of the hotel after checking in, and you think ''lt's great to be back in New York.''
Movie theatres for ever.
All these friendly women walking up and down the street. lt was... lt was great.
Yeah, New York, it was an adult portion. lt was an adult dose.
So it took a couple of trips to get into it.
You just go in the first time and you get your ass kicked and you take off.
As soon as it heals up, you come back and you try it again.
Eventually, you fall right in love with it.
Roulette Records was in the middle of this mythical place, Tin Pan Alley.
The songwriting capital of the world.
And we met some of the greatest songwriters ever.
Rock-and-roll songwriters. Doc Pomus.
Mort Shuman. Lieber and Stoller.
They were all then.
Carole King. Neil Diamond.
At the time it wasn't fair that a songwriter was the low man on the totem pole.
But then, these people...
And here come the '60s, with change and revolution and war and assassinations, and a whole other frame of mind coming along.
And these songwriters were expressing the feelings of people in the street. ln a way, it was kind of the beginning of the end of Tin Pan Alley.
' Dry your eyes
' Take your song out
' lt's a newborn afternoon
' And if you can't recall the singer
' Can you still recall the tune?
' Dry your eyes
' And play it slowly
' Just like you're marching off to war
' Sing it like you always wanted
' Like you sung it once before
' And from the centre of the circle
' To the midst of the waiting crowd
' lf it ever is forgotten
' Sing it long and sing it loud
' And come dry your eyes
' And he taught us more about living
' Than we ever cared to know
' And we came to learn the secret
' And we never let it go
' And it was more than being holy
' Though it was less than being free
' And if you can't recall the reason
' Can you hear the people sing?
' Right through the lightning and the thunder
' To the dark side of the moon
' To that distant falling angel
' That descended much too soon
' Come dry your eyes
' Dry your eyes
' Take your song out
' lt's a newborn afternoon
' And if you can't recall the singer
' You can still recall the tune
' Come dry your eyes
' Come dry your eyes
' Dry your eyes
(Robertson) Neil Diamond!
- (cheering and applause)
- Thanks very much.
When you started playing as The Band, you shied away from publicity a lot.
Talk about that a little.
That was just part of a lifestyle that we got to love in Woodstock.
We got to like it, you know, just being able to chop wood or hit your thumb with a hammer.
We'd be concerned with fixing a tape recorder, fixing a screen door.
Stuff like that.
And getting the songs together.
We always seemed to get a whole lot more done when we didn't have a lot of company around.
We were more productive.
And as soon as company came, of course, we'd start having fun.
You know what happens when you have too much fun.
Something we've kind of evaded around here, but l'll ask it now.
- What about women and the road?
- l love 'em.
That's probably why we've been on the road.
- That's it.
- Not that l don't like the music. l thought you weren't supposed to talk about it too much.
- No, l guess we're not.
- l thought we were supposed to... pan away from that sort of stuff, get into something else.
Since the beginning, since we started playing together, just like we've all grown just a little bit, so have the women.
- You know? And it's amazing.
- That's right. That's good. l just wanna break even.
(Robertson) Joni Mitchell. Right.
' No regrets, coyote
' We just come from such different sets of circumstance
' l'm up all night in the studios and you're up early on your ranch
' You'll be brushing out a brood mare's tail while the sun is ascending
' And l'll just be getting home with my reel-to-reel
' There's no comprehending
' Just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes
' And the lips you can get
' And still feel so alone
' And still feel related
' Like stations in some relay
' You're not a hit-and-run driver, no, no
' Racing away
' You just picked up a hitcher
' A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway
' We saw a farmhouse burning down
' ln the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night
' And we rolled right past that tragedy
' until we pulled in to some roadhouse lights
' Where a local band was playing
' Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
' The next thing l know
' That coyote's at my door
' He pins me in the corner and he won't take ''No!''
' He drags me out on the dance floor and we're dancing close and slow
' Now he's got a woman at home
' He's got another woman down the hall and he seems to want me anyway
' Why d'you have to get so drunk and lead me on that way?
' You just picked up a hitcher
' A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway
' l looked a coyote right in the face
' On the road to Baljennie, near my old home town
' He went running through the whisker wheat
' Chasing some prize down
' And a hawk was playing with him
' Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
' He had those same eyes, just like yours
' under your dark glasses
' Privately probing the public rooms
' And peeking through keyholes in numbered doors
' Where the players lick their wounds and take their temporary lovers
' And their pills and powders to get them through this passion play
' No regrets, coyote
' l just get off up aways
' You just picked up a hitcher
' A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway
' Coyote's in the coffee shop
' He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
' He picks up my scent on his fingers while he's watching the waitresses' legs
' He's too far from the Bay of Fundy
' From Appaloosas and eagles and tides
' And the air-conditioned cubicles
' And the carbon ribbon rides are spelling it out so clear
' Either he's gonna have to stand and fight
' Or take off out of here
' l've tried to run away myself
' To run away and wrestle with my ego
' And with this flame you put here in this Eskimo
' ln this hitcher
' ln this prisoner
' Of the fine white lines
' Of the white lines
' On the free freeway
Levon's home town, it's near West Helena.
One time we were there, for some reason or another, and we decided we were gonna look up one of the legends of that town, which was Sonny Boy Williamson. ln my opinion, he's the best harp player, that's like harmonica, blues harmonica, that l've ever heard.
He's the big Daddy of 'em.
And he took us to a friend of his, a woman's place, who served food and corn liquor. ln a southern booze can.
He would sit there and he was playing for us.
And we were getting drunk and trying to figure out where we were.
He was spitting in a can. l thought he was dipping snuff. l thought he had something in his lip.
And he kept spitting in this can and playing, and we kept getting drunker.
Finally, l looked over in the can and l realised it was blood.
He was getting pretty tired and pretty drunk by then.
And we made big plans for the future and all kinds of things we were gonna do.
And it was tremendous. A great night.
A couple of months later, we got a letter from his manager, or whoever it was, saying that he had passed away.
' Train arrive

(Robertson) Paul Butterfield!
Near Memphis, cotton country, rice country, the most interesting thing is probably the music.
Levon, who came from around there?
Carl Perkins.
Muddy Waters, the king of country music.
(Robertson) Elvis Presley.
Johnny Cash. Bo Diddley.
That's kind of the middle of the country back there.
So bluegrass or country music, you know, if it comes down to that area and if it mixes there with rhythm and if it dances, then you've got a combination of all those different kinds of music.
Country, bluegrass, blues music.
- (Robertson) The melting pot.
- Show music.
- (Scorsese) And what's it called?
- Rock and roll!
(Scorsese) Yes. Exactly.
Whoa!

OK. So, Rick, what is Shangri-La?
Maybe you could give us a little tour.
What is Shangri-La? lt's a club house where we get together and play. Make records.
Yeah.
Kind of better. lt's like an office, l guess. lt used to be a bordello.
- A bordello?
- You can tell by the wallpaper.
That decadence, that softness in the barroom. l've heard a few funny stories, man.
- That's why all these rooms are here.
- You can't believe most of what you hear.
This was a master-control bedroom, this is now a master-control music room.
Let me ask you, now that The Last
Waltz is over, what are you doing now?
- Eddie, why don't you...
- (' ''Sip the Wine'' intro)
Just making music, you know?
Oh, yeah.
Trying to stay busy, man.
' l want to lay down beside you
' l want to hold your body close to mine
' Like a grape that grows ripe... lt's where the music took you. Otherwise you would never go to such a situation.
Because of the music, it took us everywhere. lt took us to some strange places.
- (Scorsese) Physically and spiritually?
- Physically, spiritually and psychotically. lt just always wasn't on the stage.
- Even though you were on the stage.
- Even though we were on the stage.

(Robertson) Garth was one of the most amazing musicians that we knew.
He could play better than anybody we ever heard.
And Garth joined The Band if we would make him the music teacher.
We didn't know why but we said
''Sure. l mean, we're interested anyway.''
And we had to pay him $10 a week each for these music lessons.
Then l was sure it was a riff.
But then l found out what it really was. lt was that, where he was coming from and his musical education, to tell his parents at this point that we was joining a rock-and-roll band would have been like pouring it down the drain.
So he justified it to his people and his background by being a music teacher.
There is a view that jazz is evil because it comes from evil people.
But, actually, the greatest priests on 52nd Street and on the streets of New York City were the musicians.
They were doing the greatest healing work.
And they knew how to punch through music which would cure and make people feel good.
' Boards on the window
' Mail by the door
' Why would anybody leave so quickly for?

' Was it something that somebody said?
' Mama, you know we broke the rules
' Was somebody up against the law?
' Honey, you know that l'd die for you
' They got your number
' They're scared and running
' But l'm just waiting for the second coming
' Of Ophelia
' Please darken my door
' Was it something that somebody said?
' Mama, you know we broke the rules
' Was somebody up against the law?
' Oh, honey, you know that l'd die for you
' Ashes of laughter
' The ghost is clear
' Why do the best things always disappear?
' Like Ophelia
' Oh, please, come back home
Most of the show stuff, though, was like travelling shows, like tent shows.
One was Walcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels.
- (Scorsese) What was that?
- Walcott's Rabbit Foot Minstrels. Yeah.
They used to have the show start, right?
They'd have the singers and the players and the different parts of the show.
Then the master of ceremonies would come out just before the finale and explain that, after the kids go home, they'd have the midnight ramble.
- (Scorsese) The midnight...?
- The midnight ramble.
The songs would get a little bit juicier and the jokes'd get a little funnier.
And the prettiest dancer would really get down and shake it a few times.
A lot of the rock-and-roll duck walks and steps and moves came from a lot of that.
Everybody did it and so, when you would see Elvis Presley or Jerry Lee Lewis or Chuck Berry or Bo Diddley really shaking it up, it didn't come out of nowhere, lt didn't come out of the air. lt was like the local entertainment everybody was going to see.
So when they exposed it to the rest of the world, it was like this unknown beast that had come out, the grotesque of music that the devil had sent, you know?
Here we go.

Our Father, whose art's in heaven
Hollow by thy name - unless things change.
Thy wigdom come and gone.
Thy will, will be undone on earth, as it isn't heaven.
Give us this day our daily dread, at least three times a day.
And forgive us our trespasses on love's territory.
For thine is the wigdom and power and glory...

(Robertson) The road was our school. lt gave us a sense of survival. lt taught us all we know.
There's not much left that we can really take from the road.
We've had our share of...
Or maybe it's just superstitious.
- (Scorsese) Superstitious in what way?
- (Robertson) You can press your luck.
The road has taken a lot of the great ones.
Hank Williams. Buddy Holly.
Otis Redding.
Janis. Jimi Hendrix.
Elvis. lt's a goddamn impossible way of life.

You should have let me decide on what the name was with you instead ot just giving the kid a name right away, l mean, l am the tather, and it l am the tather, no matter what the situation, you should at least let me do that,
That's the least thing you could let me do,
And maybe l don't want to see the kid tor that reason,
What, do you think you're gonna make me teel guilty about it?
Give that name to that kid running around,
Atter everything that's happened with us, you had to give the kid the name Jimmy,
No way, l don't want to see the kid, because it l see the kid, l'm gonna break up, l don't want to see something l--
What good is it to see the kid? l wish this lady wasn't,,,

That's not possible,
Mr, Doyle, l can take you over to see your baby now, it you'd like,

And round and round
The world goes round and round and round
And round...
Oh, l'm sorry.
Can l do it again? l'm sorry.
Okay, here we go.
Stand by, take 1 8.
Sometimes you're happy
And sometimes you're sad
But the world goes round
Sometimes you lose
Every nickel you've had
But the world goes round
Sometimes your dreams get broken in pieces
But that doesn't alter a thing
Take it trom me
There's still gonna be
A summer, a winter, a tall, and a spring
And sometimes a triend
Starts treatin' you bad
But the world goes round
And sometimes your heart breaks
With a deatening sound
Somebody loses, somebody wins
One day it's kicks
Then it's kicks in the shins
But the planet spins
And the world goes round
But the world goes round
But the world goes round
Sometimes your dreams get broken in pieces
But that doesn't matter at all
Take it trom me, there's still gonna be
A summer, a winter, a spring
And a tall
And sometimes a triend starts treating you bad
But the world goes round
And sometimes your heart breaks
With a deatening sound
Somebody loses, and somebody wins
Then one day it's kicks
Then it's kicks in the shins
But the planet spins
And the world goes around
And round and around
And round and round
The world goes around
And round and round
And round
- How do l look?
- Pertect, Mom,
Just a minute, Screw the photograph,
She's very, very nervous,
Happy endings, all around me
Happy endings, all l see are
Happy endings on a silver screen
That's Hollywood
Lovely lady, gallant tellow
Meet one evening, hear that cello
Troubles come between
But in that tinal scene
Count on a happy ending
By a river
Happy ending, on a mountain
Happy ending, in a Broadway show
But, oh
The lite l lead is less dramatic
Not remotely cinematic
Happy endings, tar as l can see
Are only tor the stars
Not in the stars tor me
Pardon me, miss, l've a problem
And l wonder, would you help me?
Lost my glove, and l could use your light
Right, l was leaving, it's so silly
But l guess l must have dropped it
All at once, it seemed to disappear
Here,
Gee, l'm gratetul, and l'd like to
Show you my appreciation
Maybe take you out to dinner

You were in The Wiz?
I've never been in any show in my life.
I had to put something.
I really need a job, so I lied.
That's all right.
I lie all the time myself.
Oh, fuck him. He never picks me.
I did fuck him, and he never picks me either.
- You were in Traffic Jam?
- Yes, sir.
Who was the director of Traffic Jam?
- You were, Mr. Gideon.
- Oh. How was I?
- Terrific.
- And who was the choreographer?
- You were, Mr. Gideon.
- How was I?
- Fantastic.
- That's how you get a job.
God! I hope he doesn't pick her.
She's uglier than a witch's tit.
The expression is
"colder than a witch's tit."
How would you know?
You've never seen a woman's tit.
Shh! Be quiet.
Okay. Thank you all very much.
It was a terrific audition.
Just stay in line. (GROANS)
(JOE) Now, that's what I call a real drinker's nose.
And you should know, because you're a real drinker, aren't you?
Yeah.
- Also heavy into speed, aren't you?
- Yeah.
Also sleep with a great many women.
Real turn-off, huh?
Just the opposite.
I'll make up my mind about the men later, but I know which girls I want now...
Candy, Casey, Rima, Jennifer, and Victoria Porter.
- In the shocking pink leotard?
- Yeah.
See if any are willing to be swing dancers.
- She's tone-deaf, Joey.
- With those legs, who cares?
Joey, I know you're in a hurry.
- I just want to check your schedule.
- Same as always.
Joey? Joey, can we talk a minute, please?
- Joey...
- What is it?
- What about Diane?
- You left me without a soprano again!
Paul, please, please, will you let me handle it?
- What about Diane?
- What about Diane?
- I've had her in three shows. She's wonderful.
- She's wonderful.
- He needs a soprano.
- You left me without a soprano.
I gotta have a soprano!
Gentlemen,
Mr. Gideon will make up...
The tall dancer on stage right... with the blue eye shadow... he'll hit the high notes.
Tovar, Narin-Smith...
The five Murray is talking to are the girls I want. Okay with you?
(GIRL) The tall girl, Victoria...
I like her, Daddy.
Mm, she's all right.
Oh, I really screwed up that marriage.
Because I cheated. Oh, man,
I cheated every chance I could get.
Okay with you, Audrey?
Sure, fine with me. What about this weekend with Michelle?
Oh, Jesus! I forgot.
I gotta work this weekend.
Oh, Joe, you promised her!
I know I promised, but what am I gonna do?
That's okay.
- I'm sorry, Michelle.
- That's okay.
If you want me,
I'll be in the cutting room.
He promised me.
Some fucking father!
- Family?
- (JOE) Screwed up.
- Work?
- All there is.
If I were God, man...
- sometimes I think I am...
- (AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
Depends on the shit you're smoking.
Mm, okay.
If I were God, man... everybody would live forever.
No death, man!
No pennies on the eyes for anybody.
Well, there are a couple people, like my agent, who booked me into this toilet.
Why is he mumbling like that?
I'll tell you why: 'Cause I'm the dummy who let him mumble like that.
- Right.
- Shh!
- death and the clap.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- So far I've managed to avoid one of them.
You know, man, death is really a hip thing now.
But we all have very different feelings about it.
For instance, to a Catholic, death is a promotion.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- Excuse me, Stacy.
Women.
Uh... hope?
There's all this bullshit about death with dignity.
You know what death with dignity is?
You don't drool.

There's a lady in Chicago, man, wrote a book...
Dr. Kubler-Ross, with a dash.
This chick, man... without the benefit of dying herself... has broken the process of death into five stages... anger, denial, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.

Anger.
"Jesus Christ!

Bargaining.
What did I say? Anger, denial, bargaining, depression, acceptance.
If you happen to get to denial... denial... "No.
No, that's not me, man. No.
Oh, ho-ho!
Somebody else, maybe, but not me. Oh, no.

No, I do not want to run it again, thank you. We are finished.

I think it's really funny.

It's too long. I don't know.

I mean, is he looking to get laid... or is he looking for Mr. Right?
He's straight.

"Michael Graham" is a very tall name.

Somebody else, maybe, but not me."
- What is this, Eddie?
- Got me. Talk to him.
Joey, I gotta talk to you about these time sheets.
Three weeks now we've been on triple-time.
The brass is eating my ass out!
You shot 82 days on a 65-day schedule.
On a four-month editing schedule, you've gone seven months.
We're already two million, two over the original budget.
Joey, God made the entire world in six days.
He didn't go on overtime once.
You can't even cut an hour-and-a-half movie... in seven months, on triple-time?
Joey, I hate to do this.
I'm usually a very calm man... but this whole thing has got me terribly crazy.
I must put my foot down.
The whole thing has gotta stop.
It has to stop. It's got to stop!
It just simply must stop!
Josh, I made a few changes in the monologue. I think you'll like it.
I have to go to rehearsal.
- At those prices, who can afford to live?
- See you at 5:30, Eddie.
Nice talking to you, Josh.
So I accept!
Oh, my God. It is better.
- God help us all.
- Wait a minute. Real dead body.
It's better.
Okay, that looks good. I like it.
Everybody down, in a straight line.

That stinks. Let's try something else. Do me a favor.
Take off your shoes.
What's that?
- It's a mint.
- Can I have one?
No. Come on. You wouldn't like it.
Let me try this.
Here, you stand over here and then jump up on my shoulder.
(GROANS) God, you're getting heavy!
Put your leg in an arabesque.
There we are.
- How are things at home?
- Pretty good.
All right.
All right, watch your back, now.
- Anything you want to tell me?
- I promised Mom I wouldn't bring it up.
(LAUGHING) But you're gonna bring it up anyway.
Sit down, Michelle.
You can tell me anything.
Gimme your wrists. Ready, and... jump!
It's just that
I keep wondering, Dad...
Bend your knees.
What is it you keep wondering?
Why don't you get married again?
Do a head roll.
I don't get married again because I can't find anyone...
I dislike enough... to inflict that kind of torture on.
Hey, why don't you marry Katie?
She's terrific.
Keep rolling your head.
Straighten your leg.
Yeah, you're right. She's terrific.
That's exactly why
I don't want to marry her.
(COUGHING) Run off in the corner and jump, and I'll catch you.
What about Victoria?
You're not too crazy about her.
Just run and jump. Never mind that.
Come on. And... (GRUNTS)
- What about the blonde?
- What blonde?
The one in Philadelphia with the television show?
You know, the one
Mom keeps talking about.
- Oh, yeah. That blonde.
- Mm-hmm.
Jump up and wrap your legs around me.
Wrap around. That's it.
Why is it so important to you that...
Follow my hand.
Why is it so important that I get married again?
'Cause then you'd settle down and stop screwing around.
Hey! Watch your language.

- Oh, shit!
- Look at the time.
- Can't we stay a little longer?
- No, your mother will kill me.
- It's so much fun!
- No. Absolutely. Come on.
- Just five minutes!
Stop flocking your legs. Come on!
- I'll get you home.
- Please?
No, no, no, no.
Besides, if you got married again... maybe you'd have a baby, and I'd have a little brother.
I'll call Hertz and rent you a brother.

Listen, I can't make you a great dancer.
I don't even know if I can make you a good dancer.
But if you keep trying and don't quit...
I know I can make you a better dancer.

(PAUL) Don't you think it would be better if I stepped outside?
Keep playing, Paul.
I'm only doing this show because you want to play that stupid 24-year-old girl.
I knew sooner or later you'd say that.
You do think
I'm too old for the part.
Well, you're wrong.
I can play 24 years old... and I'll damn well prove it.
You want to quit the show?
Quit the show.
You don't have to do anything for me... but just don't kid yourself that you're doing this show... for any other reason except guilt about me.
Guilt? What guilt?
For never going one day when you were faithful to me.
Oh. That guilt.
Faithful, faithful!
You're always talking about being faithful.
Audrey, why do you think so small?
Besides, how do I know you were faithful to me?
Oh, you know I was.
That's right. I know you were.
Oh! You meant to do that.
Yes, I did.
You kept me working all the time.
I never had a chance to cheat.
What is this big hang-up you've got about fidelity?
What makes you think that being faithful... is the greatest friggin' virtue in the world?
Excuse me. Well... it is a great deal better than those... meaningless affairs you keep tap-dancing through... those Stacys, those Victorias.
You're not even fooling Michelle with Victoria, you know.
Straighten that leg.

Oh! The Boonies... the Wendys, the Debbies, the Donnas...
I can't even remember all their names. Give me a hand.

Quick, tell me: What was the name of the girl in Philadelphia... the blonde with the television show?
Ah. The blonde with the television show.
The blonde in Philadelphia?
I remember that girl's name.
I remember because that girl meant something to me.
The blonde with the television show, her name was Sweetheart.

Ballinger is the best there is, Audrey.
- Dr. Hyman, we just left him.
- About half an hour ago.
- And he seemed fine.
- Just fine.
Well, he called. He said he had chest pains. His left arm was numb.
(DR. HYMAN) I'm bewildered myself.
I checked him about a month ago.
All right, who's in charge of this all-important... million-dollar show that
Mr. Gideon keeps talking about?
(JONESY) I guess I am.
Mr. Gideon is having attacks of angina that could lead to a massive coronary.
Ah, shit! I gotta get back.
I'm fine. What do doctors know?
About angina, just a little more than show people.
If you want to leave, fine, but I think you'll die. Can I see you?
(JOE) Dr. Hyman?
The pain is gone. Nothing wrong with me a rewrite wouldn't cure.
- Couple of good jokes is what I need.
- You can't leave now.
- Yes, I can.
- Damn it, Joe!
Didn't you hear what the doctor just said?
Please, stay.
Joey, I've been talking to Dr. Ballinger...
Jonesy, wait a minute.
Let me talk to the star here.
If I stay, how much time are we talking about?
At least two or three weeks.
You've got to be kidding!
I got a show to put on!
For chrissakes, will you talk to these people?
They don't understand anything!
Oh, Jesus.
- What's wrong?
- Miss Collins.
- All right, easy.
- Damn it.
You guys are doing this to me.
I wasn't sick until I got here.
- What's wrong with him?
- It's exhaustion.
You're lying to me.
Yes.
(KATIE) Uh, no, I'm not a member of his immediate family.
I'm, uh... I'm his girlfriend.
Well, could I leave a message for him, please?
- (♪ UP-TEMPO)
- Could you tell him that... Hello?
It was just simply exhaustion.
He just tried to do too much.
Anyway... we've made a decision to postpone the show for four months.
- The doctors assured us Joe will be fine.
- There goes my new apartment.
Therefore the show will definitely be done. I promise.
Now, we're aware of the...
- financial burdens this might impose...
- I gave up a TV series.
- On some of you, and...
- What a dummy.
We're prepared to try to get you... temporary jobs, or even lend you money.
Jonesy, easy on the money, easy on the money.
All right, Larry. All right, okay.
We don't have a lot of cash available, but... what I'd like to say to you is...
I... we... think of you all as family.
- Bullshit.
- And we want to do... everything we possibly can... to keep you all together.
(AUDREY'S VOICE) I was with him last night. Already he's much better.

A piece of you in them?
Yeah. A piece of me.
And generally, I find it.
Well, it may take you years, but you'll find it.
Oh, you're cute. You are cute.
It's looking better.

I'm telling you, Gideon,
I got real insight into you.
There's a deep-rooted fear of being conventional.
Right.
Your blood pressure is higher than we hoped.
Your cardiograms haven't improved one bit.
If you don't give a damn, it's hard to expect us to.
Mr. Gideon!
I'll leave these menus with you.
Please check off what you want for the coming weeks, okay?
Monday, I'll have roast beef. Tuesday, chicken. Wednesday, steak.
Thursday I plan to be dead, so...
I'll just have something light.
Mr. Gideon!
She wrote a little note on the back.
She said you'd understand.
"Dear loving, giving, generous"... underlined four times... "Dad...
I hear nurses are nice people.
Hint, hint.
Your poor, brother-less daughter."
Joe, what does it mean?
It means she's inherited her mother's determination.
That's what it means.

- A great entertainer...
- A great humanitarian.
- A great humanitarian...
- And my dear friend for 25 years.
And my dearest, dearest friend for20years...
You missed by five years.
Oh, boy, do I hate show business.
Joey, you love show business.
That's right. I love show business.
I'll go either way.
- (♪ UP-TEMPO)
- (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
I got insight into you, Gideon.
You know what's underneath?
The dreadful fear that you're ordinary... not special.
Right.
(MOANING) I think...
I think...
I'm getting an erection.
Oh, Mr. Gideon, don't... don't do that!
That sex thing... Jesus!
Listen, I wouldn't say you were a faggot... but you do have a lot of feminine characteristics.
Right?
Right.
You are foolishly and childishly flirting with disaster.
(WOMAN) Joe, what are you doing?
You're really crazy! What do you want to do, kill yourself?
Dr. Ballinger told me to get a little exercise.
Everything he does seems to be a denial of his condition.
Dr. Ballinger, every time I've seen him, I get the impression... that he doesn't care whether he lives or dies.
Yes, I know.
But I think he cares a lot.
Starting now, we'll limit his visitors to no more than two.
(JOSH) Joe, I wish you could have been there.
9:30 this morning, before a single review was out... the line at Cinema One was around the block.
The people know.
I mean, the people know!
This broke every first-day record.
It's a blockbuster. A blockbuster.
I mean a blockbuster!
And those guys in California...
You wouldn't believe the telephone calls.
"Congratulations," they say.
"We're glad you took your time.
It was worth it.
Every dollar we put in that film is up there on the screen."
I'm telling you, they're talking about a $ 3 1/2 million advertising budget.
Three and a half million dollars!
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Do you believe that?
Three and a half million dollars!
This picture is going right through the roof.
Right through... the roof!
Look at those reviews.
See? We did it.
Joe, we did it!
Where are the bad ones?
There are no bad ones.
Josh.
There were a couple that quibbled a little. I left them at the office.
I want you to do me a favor:
Don't show them to me.
Never.
- How were the television reviews?
- I think we got Leslie Perry.
At the screening, she told me she loved it.
Following Joe Gideon's triumphant directorial achievement... with Fifty Beautiful Girls, Fifty... when he won every possible award... it would be nice to report that
Mr. Gideon's latest effort...
The Stand-up, starring
Davis Newman... was a better film.
- Oh, boy. Here it comes.
- The Stand-up, however, does not quite stand up.
- Joey, turn it off, please.
- Leaning toward the frenetic, Gideon falls... into his characteristic weakness of trying too hard...
- to please, to entertain.
- I'm gonna turn that off.
- Josh, no. I want to hear it.
- Slickness obscures reality.
- The old razzle-dazzle obliterates drama.
- (JOSH) What the hell does she know?
She never gave anything a good review.
That woman is totally unqualified to criticize anything.
She doesn't know a goddamn thing about film.
- Or anything.
- She's not even reviewing a film.
She's telling you how clever she is! where the has-been comic, played impeccably by Davis Newman... demonstrates his former brilliance... in a monologue where clearly... director Gideon gave
Mr. Newman free rein.
Rising above rather commonplace material...
- the actor creates a classic comic aura...
- I don't care what she says.
I guarantee this picture will do
30 million domestic, at least.
- One of you better get somebody.
- (KATIE) What?
I think I'm in trouble.
- (JOSH) I'll get somebody.
- ...chopping offends of scenes before the drama has played out... left this reviewer with bewilderment... and a four-aspirin headache.
Using my four-balloon rating system...
I give The Stand-up half a balloon.
- (MAN) How are you feeling?
- The truth?
I'm scared.
Roll 'em. Action.
Oh-ho-ho-ho, my God.
Ladies and gentlemen, the doctors.
I'm Dr. Hyman, the internist.
I'm Dr. Garry, the surgeon.
- I'm Dr. Ballinger, the cardiologist.
- Five, six, seven, eight.
ALL EXPLAINING CARDIOLOGY:
VOICES OVERLAPPING
- (♪ RIM SHOT)
- Huh?
- That means he had total blockage...
- (♪ SLIDE WHISTLE)
- in... two arteries.
- (♪ PERCUSSION FLOURISH, CYMBAL CRASH)
Oh!
This is the man who would be my first choice... as a modern-day saint.
When I was in those marches, like Selma... this brother was shufflin' right alongside me... long before those other cats who thought civil rights was a hip scene... and jumped on the "blackwagon"...
The blackwagon!
Ladies and gentlemen, let me lay on ya...
- A great entertainer.
- a great entertainer...
- A great humanitarian.
- a great humanitarian...
- And my dearest friend.
- and my dearest, dearest friend...
- For (MUFFLED) years.
- for 17years.
- Let's hear it...
- (CLICKS OFF)
- See how much I learn from you?
- I'm afraid you've learned too much.
There you are, Mr. Gideon.
This is one of my...
A1, first-rate, top-drawer jobs.
That's it.
Good luck tomorrow.
Wh-What did you mean,
I learned too much from you?
You're gonna make it.
I'm hardly ever wrong.
Thanks.
You remember last Tuesday night?
It was raining... very hard.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was raining.
What about it?
I called you at midnight.
I must have been walking the dog.
I don't have time for this sort of thing.
You were with someone.
Yes.
And you made love to him.
Yeah.
Well, that's it, huh?
- We're finished?
- I don't know.
How do you feel about me?
I love you.
Then I guess we're not finished.
Be-Because I really do love you, Katie.
- (WOMAN'S VOICE) You mean that?
- (JOE'S VOICE) Ah, hell, no!
I was pissed off at her.
I don't know.
Yeah, I did mean it. Sort of.
Sometimes I don't know where the bullshit ends and the truth begins.
I just wanted to say something nice to her.
Why?
(CHUCKLES) In case, uh...
"In case."
In case.
If I die...
I'm sorry for all... the bad things I did to you.
And if I live...
I'm sorry for all the bad things...
I'm gonna do to you. as stated in the declarations, sustained directly and solely... as the result of injury, sickness, death of, or permanent disability...
Excuse me, Mr. Clark.
Larry, give me our figures.
Well, on an estimated production budget... of $941,000... with a contingency of 59,000 to round it out to the million... so far we're in for at least two-thirds of the fees.
Design: 8,000. Costumes: 8,000.
Electrics: 4,000.
We're in for the full director-choreographer: 15,000.
Casting is another four.
Construction of scenery... where more than half has been done... that's 125,000-plus.
Stage manager's about 8, 000.
Press agent: 1,500.
Musicians: about two.
Assistants, secretaries, et cetera: 3,000.
Rehearsal halls and auditions: 9,500.
Script and administrative: 1,500.
Managers: I'd say 10.
Advertising and printing: about 20, 000.
Orchestrations: so far around 10,000.
Legal: 10,000. Auditing: 2,000.
Payroll taxes: maybe seven.
Well, seven.
Author's advances: 10,000.
Equity bonds: 50,000.
Rehearsal salaries... and we've made some advances to a few of the cast... about 43,000.
We're in for about, uh...
Yes.
That's the figure I had here.
And change.
(JONESY) Let me try to understand.
Of that figure, how much do we recoup?
I'm confused too. Do we get all of that or part or what?
Simply, here are the options. One:
If Mr. Gideon recovers... and you resume production within the 180 days... we are not liable for any of it.
Two: If Mr. Gideon should die... and you resume production with another director within the 180 days... we are still not liable.
Three, however:
If Mr. Gideon should expire before February 1... and you abandon production... we are liable for the full million dollars.
This means, gentlemen... you could make a profit of...
You could be the first show on Broadway... to make a profit without really opening.
Well... it's all very clear to me.
(COMEDIAN) There's all this bullshit about death with dignity.
You know what death with dignity is, man?

- Mm. Thank you.
- (LUCAS) How soon do you think he'll be able to work?
(JONESY) Well, he's out of intensive care, back in a private room.
The doctor says it's just a matter of rest.
Two months at the outside.
You know Joey. This morning he said he could hardly wait.
Said he had a lot of new ideas.
Mm. And not all that sex stuff, either.
Well, that's terrific.
You must feel really good about that, Jonesy.
Relieved. We're all relieved.
Check, please.
I did some thinking about your script and made a few notes.
Ah! My.
Use them, don't use them... you know, whatever you want.
I hate to bother you, but are you... Lucas Sergeant?

No, no. Not at all.

Joe, what's the matter?
I'm having a heart attack.
No, that's impossible, Mr. Gideon.
I just gave you your medication.

Will you call somebody, please?
He can't be in pain...

What are you staring at?

- The doctor's not dying.
He's alive in Florida, and I'm dying!"
No pennies on the eyes for me.
Please.
Right away, sir. Bye.
Come on, we better try to find this guy.

Folks, what can I tell you about my next guest?
This cat allowed himself... to be adored but not loved... and his success in show business was matched... by failure in his personal-relationship bag.
That's where he really bombed.
And he came to believe that work, show business... love, his whole life, even himself... and all that jazz was bullshit.
He became numero uno game player... to the point where he didn't know... where the games ended and the reality began.
Like, to this cat, the only reality... is death, man.
Ladies and gentlemen, let me lay on you... a so-so entertainer, not much of a humanitarian... and this cat was never nobody's friend.
In his final appearance on the great stage of life...
You can applaud if you wanna...

{8951}{9052}{y:i}As you can tell, we don't know this song.|{y:i}We haven't rehearsed it.
{9058}{9161}{y:i}We're just fooling around.
{10978}{11044}{y:i}One more time.
{11942}{12022}This one just gave up, didn't it?
{12397}{12422}Lunch.
{12428}{12502}I need another pair of pants.
{12508}{12568}You didn't?
{12570}{12650}I burst the seat of my pants.
{18781}{18856}We never did get it right on stage|because we... It was retarded...
{18862}{18934}...and I wanted it quick.
{19216}{19315}I wanted the group to say "heart away".
{23917}{23984}Were we in tempo?
{23990}{24043}{y:i}Where's the director? There he is.
{24049}{24132}{y:i}You want me to let you know|{y:i}when we're gonna do that...
{24138}{24172}{y:i}What do you call it?
{24178}{24248}You Don't Have to Say You Love Me.|{y:i}Just to let you know.
{24254}{24327}{y:i}We're not gonna do it now.
{25111}{25169}And Elvis will cut you off.|Just keep watching him.
{25175}{25208}You want to try "Twenty Days"?
{25214}{25267}Yeah.
{25571}{25653}We don't sing unless...
{29912}{29973}{y:i}It worked.
{30312}{30376}Here he comes.
{30412}{30478}Hi, Phil.
{30499}{30530}They say ignore these cameras.
{30536}{30584}- Where's Gigi?|- Gigi is no longer with us.
{30590}{30627}You've got to be kidding!
{30633}{30656}He had to quit.
{30662}{30780}See, what happened, Gigi was married|and had a baby, an infant...
{30786}{30840}...and he had a little boy back in Memphis.
{30846}{30908}So he had to leave the little boy|in Memphis, because...
{30914}{30973}...his wife's parents|were keeping the little boy...
{30979}{31042}...and they wouldn't let him|take him out of town.
{31048}{31112}So, they had one child in California,|and one back there.
{31118}{31191}They were traveling back and forth|and it was too much for him.
{31197}{31267}But if it was his child.|Can't he take his child with him?
{31273}{31325}It's not really his child, it was...
{31331}{31404}...his wife's child by a previous marriage.
{31410}{31511}- And she couldn't take him?|- She wouldn't take him away.
{31517}{31573}- It was just a family thing. He quit.|- Yeah.
{31579}{31702}- I sure hated to lose him 'cause...|- I know he hated to go, too.
{32088}{32118}{y:i}Okay.
{32124}{32201}{y:i}The horns are answering it here.
{32238}{32296}{y:i}Right on top of "friend".
{32302}{32382}{y:i}Right on top of "friend" like...
{32959}{33005}{y:i}Hold it.
{33011}{33031}{y:i}Right.
{33037}{33159}{y:i}I'd like to point out a problem.|{y:i}When it switches, it sounds like...
{33162}{33240}{y:i}When it switches, it sounds like|{y:i}some of the guys are just lost...
{33246}{33368}{y:i}... which is the way it is,|{y:i}but we don't have to emphasize it.
{33438}{33518}- I made a mistake.|{y:i}- It's all right.
{33537}{33640}{y:i}I wanna try something.|{y:i}This is the last verse.
{36155}{36218}{y:i}We can do a yodel.
{40362}{40424}{y:i}Play that song.
{41582}{41652}{y:i}Sing it slow.
{42041}{42076}Mary in the Morning.
{42082}{42148}{y:i}"Mary at suppertime"
{42359}{42426}{y:i}Kill that blower.
{42427}{42507}{y:i}Or blow that killer. Whatever.
{42754}{42809}{y:i}James, one minute, man.
{42815}{42927}{y:i}Wait a minute.|{y:i}They don't tell you when to start.
{42994}{43102}{y:i}Like a big old screaming eagle|{y:i}out there, man.
{43191}{43285}{y:i}You can't use those words.|{y:i}They'll cut it right out.
{43291}{43316}{y:i}They'll cut it out.
{43322}{43419}{y:i}They'll put an X rating|{y:i}right across your big mouth.
{43437}{43476}{y:i}"Mouth" I said.
{43482}{43578}{y:i}That shows how you think.|{y:i}I wouldn't say that.
{43593}{43658}{y:i}They'll cut that out. They won't leave it in.
{43664}{43756}{y:i}You can't say "big ass" in this family.
{43847}{43921}"Okay." Mary in the Morning.
{46347}{46408}{y:i}Sing it again.
{46664}{46738}{y:i}Just a chord.
{47166}{47274}You only got about another 45 minutes|of sitting around.
{47292}{47386}I know you've been great,|but listen to this.
{47512}{47584}That's the wildest laugh.
{47629}{47711}That's about how I feel.
{47941}{48024}No wonder he can't have a good time.|He's reading telegrams while we talk.
{48030}{48124}"Here's hoping you have a very successful|opening and that you break both legs."
{48130}{48186}- Goddamn!|- Tom Jones.
{48192}{48288}"My God, my God,|why hast thou forsaken me?"
{48330}{48405}Signed, "The Pope".
{48447}{48519}"Best wishes for a continuing|successful Vegas show."
{48525}{48636}"I hope you get a raise|in the next six months, Joyce Brazil."
{48706}{48785}Don't pick your nose on camera.
{48827}{48917}Don't pick your nose on camera, man.
{48950}{49039}It starts to get tense about this time.
{49116}{49179}I just hope I don't forget the words to...
{49185}{49296}..."I Just Can't Help Believin'".|I hope I don't forget the words.
{49420}{49489}Right there, that's the first verse.|You got the rest of it.
{49495}{49545}If I get through the first one, I get it.
{49551}{49624}Very proud. Nice to see you.|Hope you enjoy our show tonight.
{49630}{49686}- Have you seen Elvis before?|- I've seen him twice.
{49692}{49730}Good. We've a better show tonight.
{49736}{49829}Well, he was absolutely fantastic that time.
{49878}{49939}Nice to see you tonight.|Nice to have you with us.
{49945}{49997}Glad to have you aboard|to see Elvis tonight.
{50003}{50069}Well, of course.|He sings those Spanish songs like nobody.
{50075}{50089}Hello!
{50095}{50165}Mrs. Xavier Cugat.|How are you? Good to see you.
{50171}{50224}You came to see Elvis?
{50230}{50304}You should've seen me at dinner tonight.|I was going...
{50310}{50379}In tempo.
{50391}{50490}I never swallowed any of it.|It was all right here.
{50547}{50594}Hello, how are you?
{50600}{50690}I came to see that "pectoral destruction".
{50864}{50926}If the songs don't go well,|we can do a medley of...
{50932}{51002}We can pray.
{51059}{51111}- Has the show started yet?|- Yes.
{51117}{51213}- Who's on?|- Sammy says bring in the machine.
{51426}{51527}Straight vodka, man, it's good for you.
{52438}{52574}We could put the words of|"I Just Can't Help Believin'" on that stool.
{56503}{56552}{y:i}That's it, you know. I just...
{56558}{56630}{y:i}Tapers off to nothing.
{60090}{60161}{y:i}I knew a song about...
{60166}{60250}{y:i}I don't know, when I was a baby.
{60302}{60414}{y:i}You got to lean on your knee, like this.|{y:i}Like a fool.
{60602}{60698}{y:i}It's a very tender love song. It's a ballad.
{60704}{60794}{y:i}You get up into a girl's face,|{y:i}you know, very close...
{60800}{60826}{y:i}... and you say:
{60832}{60896}{y:i}"Yeah!"
{60922}{61004}{y:i}And it blows her hair straight back.
{62942}{62981}{y:i}You know, when I first started...
{62987}{63044}{y:i}... in this business...
{63050}{63091}{y:i}... I was a little, bitty guy...
{63097}{63169}{y:i}... with a shaky leg.
{63169}{63223}{y:i}So, Ed Sullivan saw me and said:
{63229}{63301}{y:i}"Son of a bitch."
{63427}{63491}{y:i}Anyway, they put me on TV|{y:i}and filmed me from the waist up.
{63497}{63571}{y:i}You know, I'm going...
{63626}{63720}{y:i}Anyway, MGM is doing a movie...
{63723}{63781}{y:i}... called...
{63787}{63875}...Elvis Loses his Excess.
{63908}{63982}{y:i}"Shakes his Excess Off", or whatever it is.
{63988}{64072}{y:i}So don't let these cameras throw you.
{64075}{64152}{y:i}Give me an E, or a G, or an F, or a D.
{64158}{64239}{y:i}Or a B-flat minor, plus one.
{64267}{64320}{y:i}I don't know what I'm talking about.
{64326}{64413}{y:i}If you milk this thing long enough...
{64494}{64579}{y:i}I'll put this in front of you, Ronnie.
{65786}{65846}{y:i}Play it, Jim.
{67384}{67458}{y:i}I made a movie about it.
{67598}{67693}{y:i}What are you laughing at?|{y:i}This is my first guitar. I was little.
{67699}{67736}{y:i}I told you.
{67742}{67807}{y:i}Little bitty cat,|{y:i}trying to get people to listen to me.
{67813}{67883}{y:i}Listen to me, I'm good.
{67978}{68029}{y:i}Not with that voice, you ain't.
{68035}{68095}{y:i}Anyway...
{68312}{68405}{y:i}Anyway, my first movie,|{y:i}ladies and gentlemen.
{68452}{68535}{y:i}That's really this guitar doing that.
{69401}{69466}{y:i}How you doing, sir?
{69480}{69525}{y:i}Thank you.
{69531}{69601}{y:i}Are you afraid of me?
{70539}{70626}{y:i}Hang loose, I'll be with you in a minute.
{70962}{71030}{y:i}I'll be over there.
{73878}{73964}{y:i}Sorry I couldn't make it up there.
{74534}{74611}{y:i}Take it home, baby!
{74801}{74826}{y:i}That's it.
{74832}{74905}{y:i}Thank you very much.
{75047}{75106}{y:i}Everybody ready?
{75112}{75164}{y:i}I'm not.
{75170}{75235}{y:i}I'm not.
{75271}{75334}{y:i}Okay.
{78550}{78584}{y:i}What you got there?
{78590}{78664}{y:i}What's that look for?
{78670}{78693}{y:i}Picture of me?
{78699}{78728}{y:i}That's very nice.
{78734}{78812}{y:i}Looks like Engelbert Humperdinck.
{78850}{78883}{y:i}Yeah, sure will.
{78889}{78932}{y:i}Time-out, folks. Just one second.
{78938}{79034}{y:i}Bahija. Is that your name?
{79143}{79193}{y:i}- You want me to have this one?|- Do you like it?
{79199}{79248}{y:i}Thank you very much. Yes, it's very nice.
{79254}{79331}{y:i}I can't do that. I'm sorry.
{79362}{79430}{y:i}Hang loose, you'll get it back.
{79436}{79498}{y:i}Okay.
{79498}{79542}{y:i}I just did a country and western album.
{79548}{79601}{y:i}In it is a song. It's called:
{79607}{79681}Just Pretend.
{84869}{84953}{y:i}Thank you. Thank you very much.
{84978}{85040}{y:i}Thank you.
{87278}{87344}{y:i}Play the song, James.
{92473}{92548}{y:i}One, two, three, four!
{103174}{103255}{y:i}What are you looking at back there?
{109751}{109814}{y:i}Thank you.
{110036}{110096}{y:i}Good evening.
{110140}{110196}{y:i}Just grab hold, honey, anywhere.
{110202}{110234}{y:i}There you go.
{110240}{110306}{y:i}Hi, little girl.
{110337}{110413}{y:i}Oh, what's the matter, baby?
{110508}{110573}Please, kiss me!
{110600}{110660}I love you!
{110699}{110739}{y:i}Okay. Sure.
{110745}{110841}{y:i}You want to get serious|{y:i}or just play a little bit?
{110932}{110994}{y:i}Okay.
{113682}{113781}{y:i}If we start doing those,|{y:i}we'll be up here all night.

{136089}{136158}I've made it back, huh?
{136164}{136230}I almost put it off, because...
{136236}{136327}I was a little too nervous at first.
{136454}{136495}The show was beautiful.
{136501}{136597}You were terrific. You did all my moves.
{136709}{136775}- How are you? Good to see you.|- Good to see you.

Sometimes I stand looking at my wife without her knowing I'm here.
The first time she entered that room she said,
"Oh, how nice. I feel at home here. "
We hadn't known each other long.
We met at a bishops' conference In Trondheim.
She was there as a journalist.
I told her about the parsonage out here.
I ventured to suggest a visit when the conference was over.
On the way, I asked her to marry me.
She didn't answer, but when we entered the room she said,
"Oh, how nice. I feel at home here. "
Since then we've lived a quiet, happy Iife at the parsonage.
Eva has, of course, told me about her earlier life.
After leaving school she went on to college got engaged to a doctor and lived with him for several years.
Wrote two small books.
Came down with tuberculosis, broke offthe engagement and moved from Oslo to a small town In the south of Norway where she began to work as a journalist.
This is the first of her books. I like it so much.
She has written,
"One must learn to live.
I practice every day.
" My biggest obstacle is I don't know who I am.
"I grope blindly.
"If anyone loves me as I am
"I may dare at last to look at myself.
" For me, that possibility is fairly remote."
I'd like to tell her just for once that she is loved whole-heartedly but I can't say it in such a way that she'd believe me. I can't find the right words.
I've written to Mama. Am I interrupting?
- No, no. Come in. I'll turn offthe radio.
- I can come back later.
No, please read me the letter.
" Dearest Mama, I was in town yesterday and ran into Agnes
"who was on a visit to her parents.
"She told me Leonardo had died.
"I know what a terrible blow this must be to you.
"I'm wondering now if you'd like to come and visit us
"for a few days or weeks.
"So that you won't say no right off
"the parsonage is very spacious.
"You'll have your own room with all conveniences.
"We have a piano and you can practice all you want to.
"It would make a change from a hotel.
" Do say you'll come!
"We'll make a fuss over you and spoil you.
"It's ages since we last met.
"7 years this October!
" Much love from Viktor and Eva."
- That's fine.
- Are you sure?
- Mama darling!
- Eva! Well, here I am!
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Yes,just fancy. It was a long trip.
- Yes, I know.
- How beautiful it is here!
- Do stay a long time.
- Indeed I will.
- I can't believe you're here.
- Let's go for a nice long walk.
- What heavy bags! Have you brought all your music?
- Yes,
I'm staying for good! -It would be nice.
- You'll give me some lessons,won't you?
- Yes.
Where's Viktor? -He's not at home for the moment.
We didn't think you'd come so early.
- This is your room.
- Oh, isn't it nice!
And what a beautiful view. -The bathroom's here.
- How nice and up-to-date. -I hope one wardrobe is enough.
Everything's fine. I really am very tired.
I sat with Leonardo the last day and night.
He was in bad pain and was given shots every two hours.
Now and then he cried because it hurt.
He wasn't afraid of dying.
Outside the hospital they were drilling and hammering.
The sun was blazing down and there were no awnings.
We tried to get another room but many wards were closed for repairs.
Towards evening the noise stopped and I could open the window.
The heat outside was like a wall, and not a breath of wind.
In the evening the doctor came. He's an old friend.
He said it wouldn't be long now.
Leonardo would get a shot every half
- hour so he could die without pain.
Then the doctor left and the ward nurse came in.
She said I should eat, but I wasn't hungry.
The smell was making me sick.
Leonardo dozed off then woke up and asked me to go out of the room.
He rang for the night nurse and she came in with a shot.
A minute or two later she came out and said
Leonardo was dead.
I sat with him all night.
He had been my friend for 18 years.
We had lived together for thirteen and had never had an angry word.
For two years he had known he was ill and that there was no hope.
As often as I could I went to see him at his villa near Naples.
He was kind and thoughtful and happy about my success.
We talked and joked and played chamber music.
He hardly ever spoke of his illness and he wouldn't have liked me to ask.
One day he gave me a long look then laughed and said:
"This time next year I'll be gone
"but I'll always be with you.
I'll always think of you."
It was sweet of him to say so but he was apt to be rather theatrical.
I can't say I go around grieving.
Of course he's left a gap, but it's no good fretting.
Do you think I've changed much?
- You're just the same.
- I dye my hair of course.
Otherwise I'm the same, don't you think?
I bought this outfit in
Z'rich. Saw it in a window went in and tried it on and it fit perfectly.
- Don't you think it's nice?
- Yes, very.
Will you help me with this case? My back's giving me hell.
Have you a board to put under the mattress?
We put one there yesterday.
Eva dear, what is it? Have
I said something wrong?
I'm just so glad to see you.
Give me a nice squeezy hug, as you did when you were little.
I've done nothing but chattered about myself.
Tell me about you. How are things?
- Oh, fine.
- Don't you lead a very isolated life?
- No, we have our parish work.
- Yes, of course.
I often play the organ. Last month I had a musical evening.
I played and talked about each piece.
- I hope you'll play for me.
- I'd love to.
I gave five school concerts in Los Angeles.
3,000 children each time.
I played and talked to them. I was a huge success.
There's something I have to tell you.
Helena is here.
You should have told me.
If I had, you wouldn't have come.
I'm sure I would have.
And I'm sure you wouldn't.
Isn't Leonardo's death enough?
Why drag poor Lena here too?
She's been here for the last two years.
Viktor and I asked her if she'd like to live with us.
- I wrote to you.
- I never got the letter.
Or else you never bothered to read it.
- Aren't you being rather unfair?
- Yes. I'm sorry.
I'm not up to seeing her.
At any rate not today.
Helena is a wonderful person.
She's longing to see you. -It seemed so nice for her at that home.
- I wanted her with me.
- Are you sure she's better off here?
Yes. And I have someone to look after.
Has she... I mean is she... Is she worse?
Oh yes, she's worse.
It's part of the disease.
Come along then, let's go and see her.
- Are you sure?
- I have no choice.
Some people are so naive.
- You mean me?
- If the shoe fits.
Dear Lena!
I've thought of you so often, every day.
Helena is afraid of giving you her cold.
I haven't had a cold for twenty years.
What a lovely room you have!
I have the same view from my room.
Helena wants you to take her head in your hands. -Like that?
I'm so glad Eva's looking after you.
I thought you were still at that home. I would have come to visit.
But it's much better like this, isn't it?
Now we can be together every day.
- Are you in pain?
- No.
- How nicely you've done your hair.
- It's in your honor.
Suppose I read aloud to you? Would you like that?
And we can go for a drive. I've never been around here before.
- What?
- Helena says you must be awfully tired and not to make any more effort today.
Well done, Mama.
- Doesn't Lena have a wristwatch? I'll give you mine.
It was a gift from an admirer who said I was always late.
Will Lena be having dinner with us? -No, she's on a diet.
She ate far too much at the hospital.
Why do I feel like I have a temperature?
Why do I want to cry?
I'm to be put to shame, that's the idea.
Then a guilty conscience.
Always a guilty conscience!
I was in such a hurry to get here. What was I expecting?
What was I longing for so desperately?
This extraordinary mother!
You should have seen her when I told her Lena was here.
She actually managed to produce a smile despite her surprise and alarm.
And as we stood outside Lena's door: an actress before her entrance, scared but in control.
The performance was superb.
Why on earth did she come here?
What did she expect of a meeting after 7 years? What did she expect?
- I wonder.
- And what did I expect? Does one never stop hoping?
- I don't think so.
- Always mother and daughter!
No use starting to cry. Damn it!
There she sat, gazing at me with her big eyes.
I held her face and felt the disease twitching at her throat muscles.
Damn it!
To think I can't carry her to my bed and comfort her as I did when she was three.
That soft, torn body that's my Lena!
Don't cry, for Christ's sake.
A writer whose name I've forgotten said,
" It's like a ghost falling on top of you
"when you open the door to the nursery
"having long since forgotten it is the nursery."
- Do you think I'm grown up?
- I guess being grown up is being able to handle your dreams and hopes.
Not longing. -Do you think so?
Maybe you stop being surprised.
How sensible you look, with your old pipe.
- You're quite grown up.
- I wonder. I'm surprised every day.
- At what?
- At you.
And I have the most unreasonable dreams and hopes.
And a longing too, come to that.
- Longing?
- Yes. I long for you.
Those are very pretty words.
Words that don't mean anything real.
I was brought up with beautiful words.
Mama is never furious or disappointed or unhappy she is "pained". You have a lot of words like that too.
It's a kind of occupational disease.
If you long for me when I'm here,
I begin to be suspicious.
- You know what I mean.
No. If I knew, it would never enter your head to say so.
I must see to the veal roast.
Mama thinks I'm a hopeless cook.
- Mama thinks you're a...
- ...wonderful cook. Thank you!
And she's to have decaffeinated coffee.
I'll cut my visit short.
I can manage four days.
Then I'll go to Africa as I originally planned.
This hurts, Charlotte.
It hurts. Hurts. Hurts.
I've often wondered why she sleeps badly. Now I know.
If that woman slept normally, her vitality would crush everyone.
Her insomnia is nature's way of using up the surplus energy.
I'll put on my red dress just to spite Eva.
I'm sure she thinks I ought to be in mourning.
See how carefully she dresses for dinner.
Her dress will be a discreet reminder that she's a lonely widow.
I'm angry the whole time. Viktor and Eva have been sweet to me.
Viktor's a kindly soul.
Lucky for Eva, the cry-baby.
I don't suppose the shower works.
Yes, it does!
- What a lovely dress!
- Does it suit me?
One day I met a friend who said,
"I've just come from a fashion show.
"There was a divine red dress which is absolutely you!"
To your health, Charlotte. We're delighted to have you with us.
Eva, see if I left my glasses on the table.
Thank you, darling.
That was my agent, he's so sweet.
The only friend I have left.
You remember him. Old Paul. We've worked together now for 30 years.
What a fine old instrument! What a lovely tone! And just tuned.
Now I'm really happy.
I didn't need to worry.
- What do you mean, Mama?
I was nervous of seeing you again after so many years.
I nearly didn't come.
This peculiar coffee is a bore but what can I do when I can't sleep?
I see you're working on the Chopin preludes.
Play something. -Not now.
Don't be childish. You'd give me great pleasure.
But you wanted your mother to hear you.
But it's all a sham. I have no technique.
I haven't even bothered to learn the fingering.
Darling, no more excuses. Come on now, play.
Eva, my dearest.
- Is that all?
- I was just so moved.
- Did you like it?
- I liked you.
- I don't follow.
- Play something else.
- What was wrong?
- Nothing.
You didn't like my interpretation.
- We all have our own.
- Exactly. I want to know yours.
- You're cross.
- No, I'm upset. You won't tell me your idea of this prelude. -All right, if you insist.
Your technique wasn't at all bad though you might have taken more interest in Cortot's fingering.
But let's just talk about the conception.
Chopin was emotional, but not mawkish.
Feeling is very far from sentimentality.
The prelude tells of pain, not reverie.
You have to be calm, clear and harsh.
Take the first bars now.
It hurts, but he doesn't show it.
Then a short relief.
But it evaporates at once, and the pain is the same.
Total restraint the whole time.
Chopin was proud, passionate, tormented and very manly. He wasn't a mawkish old woman.
This prelude must be made to sound almost ugly.
It is never ingratiating.
It should sound wrong.
You have to battle your way through it and emerge triumphant.
Like this.
I see.
- Don't be cross with me.
- Why should I be? On the contrary.
For 45 years I've worked at these terrible preludes.
They still contain a lot of secrets.
When I was little, I admired you enormously.
Then I got pretty tired of you and your pianos.
Now I admire you again, but in a different way.
- Then there's some hope.
- Yes, I guess so.
- Where are you?
- I'm up here, Mama.
I've changed, so we can go for a walk if you like.
- Is this the nursery?
- Yes, it's Erik's room.
- Fancy letting it stay like this!
- We've often talked of altering it.
Sometimes I come and sit here and let my thoughts wander.
- Let's go.
- Wait, Mama! Feel the nice atmosphere in here.
Erik drowned the day before his fourth birthday.
But you know that.
It was too much for Viktor.
I grieved a lot, outwardly.
Deep inside, I felt he was still alive, that we were living close to each other.
All I have to do is concentrate, and he's there.
Sometimes, as I'm falling asleep
I can feel him breathing on my face and touching me with his hand.
He's living another life, but we can reach one another.
There's no dividing line, no insurmountable wall.
I wonder what the reality looks like where my little boy is living.
I know it can't be described.
It's a world of liberated feelings.
Do you know what I mean?
To me, man is a tremendous creation, an inconceivable thought.
In man is everything, from the highest to the lowest.
Man is God's image, and in God there is everything.
So human beings are created, but also the demons and the saints, the prophets and artists and iconoclasts.
Everything exists side by side.
It's like huge patterns changing all the time.
In the same way, there must also be countless realities not only the reality we perceive with our dull senses but a tumult of realities arching above each other inside and outside.
It's just fear and priggishness to believe in limits.
There are no limits. Neither to thoughts nor to feelings.
It's anxiety that sets limits.
When you play the slow movement of the Hammerklavier sonata you must feel you're living in a world without limitations in an activity you can never see through or explore.
Let's go for a walk before it gets too dark.
I thought I heard Helena calling. Excuse me.
I think Eva is awfully unhappy.
I'm appalled when I hear her holding forth. It's so neurotic.
Just a moment, Charlotte and I'll try to explain how I view my wife.
When I asked Eva to marry me, she said she didn't love me.
- What do you mean?
- I asked if she loved someone else.
She said she had never loved anyone, that she was incapable of loving.
Eva and I lived here for several years. Then Erik was born.
We'd given up hope of a child of our own and talked of adopting one.
With her pregnancy, Eva underwent a complete change.
She became cheerful, gentle and outgoing.
She got lazy and couldn't be bothered with her parish work or her piano-playing.
She would sit by that window gazing at the play of light over the fell and the fjord.
We were suddenly very happy.
I'm much older than Eva.
I felt as if a gray film were settling over life.
I felt as if I could look back and say,
"Well, well, so that was my life, that's how it all turned out."
But suddenly things were different.
Please forgive me, but it's still rather hard to...
Yes. We had some years that were very rich. Erik.
You should have seen Eva.
At the time of Erik's birth
I was recording all the Mozart sonatas.
- I hadn't one day free.
- No.
We invited you over and over again.
When Erik drowned, that gray film got even grayer.
For Eva it was different.
- Different?
- Her feeling lives, uncorroded.
Or so it seems anyway.
If she feels that her son is alive and near her, well, perhaps that's how it is.
She seldom speaks of it.
I guess she's afraid it might upset me as indeed it would.
But what she says sounds true enough.
- I believe her.
- Yes, you're a minister.
- My faith lives on her terms.
- I'm sorry if I hurt you.
It doesn't matter. Unlike you and Eva,
I'm diffuse and uncertain. It's my own fault.
I think I'll take a good dose of sleeping pills tonight.
It's so peaceful here, only the hiss of the rain on the roof.
- Do you have all you need?
- Couldn't be better.
Cookies and mineral water, tape recorder, two detective novels, my blindfold and ear
- plugs and my travel blanket.
Like to taste my delicious Swiss chocolate?
- You can have two pieces.
- I don't like chocolate.
I seem to remember you were crazy about candy as a child.
- Helena liked it. I didn't.
- Good, all the more for me.
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, my pet.
Viktor is a delightful person.
You must take care of him.
- I do.
- Are you happy together?
Do you get on well?
- Viktor is my best friend.
I can't imagine life without him.
- He said you didn't love him.
- Did he say that?
- Yes. Why?
- Oh,just rather surprising.
Was it a secret?
But he shouldn't have said it?
- He's not the confiding sort.
- We were talking about you.
- If you want to know anything, ask me.
I'll answer truthfully.
- Now, don't get upset.
A mother naturally worries about her daughter.
We spoke of you with the greatest affection.
If only you'd leave people alone!
I've left you alone far too long.
- You're right.
- Give me a hug. Promise you're not angry.
- I'm not.
- I love you, don't you see.
I love you too.
It's not much fun being alone always.
I envy you and Viktor.
Now that Leonardo's dead,
I'm so awfully lonely.
Don't you see? -Yes.
I'll begin to weep with self-pity in a minute.
This book isn't at all bad.
It's by Adam Kretzinsky.
Have you heard of him?
I met him in Madrid. Mad as a hatter.
I couldn't defend myself. In fact, I didn't.
- Shall I put out this light?
- Yes, please.
- I'll bring your breakfast.
- Don't trouble yourself.
- But I want to spoil you.
- Very well, if you insist.
Strong coffee, hot milk, two slices of German bread with cheese, one slice of toast with honey.
- And orange juice.
- I nearly forgot.
I can... -Juice it will be.
Good night, darling. -Good night, Mama.
I think I'll have a look at my accounts.
I'll have Brammer invest the money from Leonardo.
The house is worth quite a bit too.
You never bothered about money.
You were above mundane worries and left all problems to your Charlotte.
3,735,866 francs.
To think you had so much money. Who'd have thought it?
And you leave it all to your old Charlotte.
I've got a little nest egg, too.
Together, it comes to over five million.
What am I going to do with so much money?
I'll buy a nice car for Viktor and Eva.
They can't drive around in that old rattle-trap.
On Monday we'll go into town and look at a new car.
It'll cheer them up. Me too.
"She offered him the red flower of her virginity.
" He accepted it without enthusiasm..."
What trash!
Adam was quite an idiot, he was, even if he did nearly commit suicide because of me.
Supposing I buy a new car for myself and give them the Mercedes?
Then I can fly to Paris and buy a car there and won't have to drive all that way.
Tomorrow, I must get down to Ravel.
It's disgraceful how lazy I've been of late.
Mama, what's happened?
I heard you call out, and you were not in your room.
I'm sorry to wake you, but
I had such a horrible dream...
I can't remember it.
- Shall I keep you company?
No thank you, dear. You go back to bed.
Very well.
- You do like me, don't you?
- You are my mother.
That's one way of answering.
- Do you like me?
- I love you.
Do you?
I broke off my career to stay at home with you and Papa.
Your back prevented you from practicing six hours a day.
Your playing got worse and so did your reviews.
Have you forgotten it? -No, but Eva...
I don't know which I hated more when you were at home or when you were on tour.
I realize now you made life hell for Papa and me.
Your father and I were very happy.
I'd have done anything for him.
- You were unfaithful to him.
- I was not!
I was quite honest with Josef.
I fell in love with Martin and lived with him for 8 months.
It wasn't a bed of roses. -It was I who had to sit with Papa in the evenings.
It was I who had to comfort him to keep repeating that you did love him just the same, that you were sure to come back.
I read your letters out loud.
Your long, loving, amusing letters in which you told us of your interesting travels.
We sat there like two idiots reading your letters over and over. We thought a more wonderful person didn't exist.
You hate me.
I don't know. I looked forward so much to your coming.
I don't know what I was imagining.
Maybe I thought you were lonely and sad.
I'm so confused.
I thought I was grown up and could look clearly at you and me and Helena's illness and our childhood.
Now it's all one big muddle.
It's all right now. Wake up.
I'll sit here with you until you go to sleep.
To you, I was a doll you played with when you had time.
If I was sick or naughty, you handed me overtoyour nursemaid.
You shutyourself in and worked, andno one was allowed to disturb you.
I used to stand outside, listening.
When you'd stop for coffee, I'd go in to see ifyou really existed.
You were always kind, butyour mind was elsewhere.
If I spoke, you'd hardly answer.
Thank you.
Mama wants to be left alone now.
Run along and play outside.
It's such a lovely day.
You always looked so nice, so I wanted to be nice.
I always worried that you wouldn't like my appearance.
I was so ugly. Lean and angular with big cow's eyes, and big wide lips andno eyebrows.
My arms were too thin and my feet too big.
No, I thought I looked repulsive.
Once you said: "You should have been a boy, " and laughed so I wouldn't be upset.
I was, of course. Then one day your suitcases would be downstairs and you'd be talking on the phone in a foreign language.
I used to pray that something would stop you from going, butyou always went.
You'd putyour arms around me and kiss me and look at me and smile.
You smelled nice but strange.
You yourself were a stranger, already on your way. You didn't see me.
Then you'd be gone. I used to think, "Now I'll die,
"it hurts so much. I'll never be happy again.
"How can I bear such pain for two months?"
And I'd cry In Papa's lap. He'd sit quite still with his soft hand on my head.
He'd go on and on sitting there smoking his old pipe.
Sometimes he'd say, "Let's go to a movie this evening, "or
"What about ice cream for dinner today? "
But all I wanted was to die.
So the days and weeks passed.
We shared the loneliness quite well.
We didn't have much to say but I never disturbed him.
Sometimes he'd look worried. I didn't know then that he was always short of money. But whenever I'd come clumping along, his face would brighten, and he'd pat me with his pale little hand.
Or else Uncle Otto would be sitting on the sofa, drinking brandy.
They'd mumble to each other.
I wonder if they heard what they said.
Or else Uncle Harry would be there and they'd play chess, and then it'd be extra quiet.
I could hear three different clocks ticking.
A few days before you were due home
I'd get a temperature from the excitement.
I'd worry I might really get sick, because you were afraid of sick people.
When you did come, I was so happy
I couldn't say anything.
You'd get impatient and say,
"Eva doesn't seem very pleased to have her mother home again. "
I'd blush red as a beet and break out in a sweat.
I couldn't say anything, I had no words.
You had taken charge of all the words in our home.
- You're exaggerating.
- I must finish speaking.
I know I'm tipsy but otherwise
I wouldn't have said what I have.
When I don't dare say any more because I'm ashamed you can explain and I'll listen and understand just as I've always done.
I loved you, Mama, it was a matter of life and death.
But I distrusted your words.
They didn't match the expression in your eyes.
You have a beautiful voice. When I was little,
I could feel it all over my body.
But I knew instinctively you didn't mean what you said.
I couldn't understand your words.
The most horrible thing was, you'd smile when you were mad.
When you hated Papa you'd call him
"my dearest." When you were tired of me you'd say
"darling little girl."
How quiet.
What am I to say?
- Defend yourself.
- Is it worth while?
- How do I know?
- You reproach me for going away and for staying at home.
I had a hell of a time those years.
My back hurt, I couldn't practice.
Important engagements were cancelled.
My life seemed meaningless.
I had a guilty conscience about always being away from you and Papa.
You smile sarcastically. I'm trying to speak truthfully.
I'm merely telling you how I felt.
We may as well have this out for once then we won't refer to it again.
Go on.
I was in Hamburg, playing Beethoven's First.
It's not too difficult, and everything had gone well.
After the concert I went out to supper with Schmiess, the conductor.
We always did. When we'd been eating and drinking for a while and I was content and relaxed and my back wasn't aching, Schmiess said,
"Why don't you stay at home with your husband
"and child and lead a respectable life,
"instead of laying yourself open to constant humiliation?"
I stared at him and laughed and said,
" Did I play so badly?" " No," he said
"but I can't help thinking of August 18, 1934.
"We played Beethoven's
First together in Linz.
"You were twenty years old, the hall was packed,
"we played like gods, the orchestra was inspired.
"Afterwards, the audience stood up and cheered
"and the orchestra gave a fanfare."
Then he said "You had a simple red summer dress
"and long hair to your waist."
" How do you remember all that?" I asked.
"I wrote it down in my score," he said.
"I make a note of all my great experiences."
When I got back to the hotel, I couldn't sleep.
At three in the morning I phoned Josef and told him I was going to stop touring, and stay at home with him and you. We'd be a real family.
Josef was awfully happy.
We wept with emotion, both of us, and talked for two hours.
And that was that. That summer we were happy. Weren't we?
You weren't happy? -No.
You said things had never been so good.
I said it to please you.
That just goes to show. What did I do wrong?
I was fourteen and you directed the whole of your pent-up energy against me.
You were damn well going to make up for your neglect.
I tried to defend myself, but I didn't' have a chance.
You trotted out your thoughtfulness and your worried voice.
There wasn't one detail that escaped your loving energy.
I had a stoop. You got to work with gymnastics.
We did exercises together.
You thought my hair was too long, so you had it cut short. It was hideous.
Then you got the idea my teeth were crooked so I got braces. I looked grotesque.
You said I couldn't go around in pants any longer so you had dresses made without asking what I thought.
I didn't dare say no because
I didn't want to upset you.
You brought along books for me which I didn't understand.
I read and read, then you and I had to discuss it. You'd hold forth and my mind was a blank.
I was scared you'd expose my stupidity.
But one thing I did Understand: not a shred of the real me could be loved or accepted.
You were obsessed and I grew more and more afraid and annihilated.
I said what you wanted me to say and made your gestures.
I didn't dare to be myself even when I was alone because I hated what was my own.
It was horrible, Mama! I still shake all over when I think of those years. It was horrible.
I didn't realize I hated you as I was quite sure we loved each other.
I couldn't hate you, so my hatred turned into an insane fear.
I had nightmares.
I bit my nails.
I pulled out tufts of hair.
I tried to scream but could only make stifled grunts.
That frightened me even more as I thought I was going out of my mind.
Then came Stefan. -And made you pregnant.
I was 18. Stefan was grown-up.
We could have managed.
- No!
- We wanted to have the child butyou spoiled everything.
That's not true! I said to Papa we should wait and see. You didn't realize Stefan was an idiot.
Were you present at our discussions?
Were you lurking under our bed?
Have you ever given a damn about any living soul except yourself?
I didn't force you into an abortion.
How could I defy you? I was afraid and needed help.
I tried to help you. I thought abortion was the only way.
I've thought so all along. All this hatred!
Why have you never said anything?
- Because you never listen.
You're a goddamn escapist.
You're emotionally crippled.
In actual fact you detest me and Helena.
You're shut up inside yourself and always stand in your own light.
I loved you, but you thought I was disgusting and stupid and a failure.
You managed to injure me for life, just as you are injured.
All that was sensitive and delicate, you attacked.
All that was alive, you tried to smother.
You talk of my hatred.
Your hatred was no less.
Your hatred is no less.
I was little and malleable and loving.
You bound me because you wanted my love just as you want everyone else's love.
I was utterly at your mercy.
It was all done in the name of love.
You kept saying you loved me and Papa and Helena.
And you were an expert at love's intonations and gestures.
People like you are a menace.
You should be locked away and rendered harmless.
A mother and a daughter.
What a terrible combination of feelings and confusion and destruction.
Everything is possible and is done in the name of love and solicitude.
The mother's injuries are to be handed down to the daughter.
The mother's failures are to be paid for by the daughter.
The mother's unhappiness is to be the daughter's unhappiness.
It's as if the umbilical cord had never been cut.
Is it so?
Is the daughter's misfortune the mother's triumph?
Is my grief your secret pleasure?
My back's aching.
Do you mind If I lie on the floor, it's the only thing that helps.
I remember very little of my childhood.
I can't recall my parents ever having touched me, either with caresses or punishments.
I was quite ignorant of everything to do with love: tenderness, contact, intimacy, warmth.
Only through music did I have a chance to show my feelings.
Sometimes, when I lie awake at night
I wonder whether I've lived at all.
Is it the same for everybody?
Or do some people have a greater talent for living than others.
Or do some people never live but just exist?
Then I'm seized by fear.
I'm seized by fear and see a horrible picture of myself.
I have never grown up.
My face and my body have aged.
I acquire memories and experiences, but inside all that I haven't even been born.
I can't remember any faces not even my own.
Sometimes, I try to recall my mother's face but I can't see her. I know she was big and dark and had blue eyes, a large nose and full lips.
But I can't fit the various bits together.
I can't see her. In the same way,
I can't see your face or
Helena's or Leonardo's.
I remember giving birth
To you and your sister but all I know of the deliveries is that they hurt.
But the pain? What was that like?
I don't remember.
Leonardo once said that... how did he put it now...
"A sense of reality is a matter of talent.
" Most people lack that talent and maybe it's just as well."
Do you know what he meant? -Yes, I do.
How very strange. -Strange?
I've always been afraid of you. -I can't understand that.
I think I wanted you to take care of me.
To put your arms around me and comfort me.
I was a child.
Does that matter? -No.
I saw you loved me and I wanted to love you, but
I was afraid of your demands.
- I didn't have any.
- I thought you did.
I didn't want to be your mother.
I wanted you to know I was as helpless as you were.
Is that really true?
- What are you thinking about?
- Leonardo and Helena.
I don't understand.
Why, they hardly knew each other.
We were together on Bornholm one Easter.
- You left after 3 days.
I was to play Bartok's First in Geneva.
I wanted to go through the concerto with the conductor in peace an quiet.
So it's possible I did leave earlier.
The weather was hideous. Leonardo was in a bad mood. So were you.
Why make me remember it all?
I'll tell you.
You arrived on Thursday.
That evening we laughed and sang and drank wine and played some old game we found.
Helena wasn't so ill then. She was happy all evening.
Leonardo was happy because she was.
He talked and joked with her.
She fell head over heels in love.
They sat together until late at night.
Next day Helena told me he had kissed her.
In the evening we had guests.
Leonardo drank too much and played all the Bach solo suites.
He was quite unlike himself, heavy and gentle and as if enlarged.
He played badly but beautifully.
Helena sat there in the dusk, beaming.
I've never seen anything like it.
You and I went for a walk. You chattered away.
I didn't really listen. I was thinking of those two.
When we got home, they were sitting as we'd left them.
You went off to bed and I had to help Leonardo upstairs.
Outside the door of the bedroom he stopped, looked at me and said,
"Can you imagine? There's a butterfly
"fluttering against the window."
When I went back to Helena, she was sitting bolt upright, quite relaxed and calm.
There wasn't a trace of her illness.
I'll never forget her face, Mama.
I'll never forget her face.
Next morning you left for Geneva, four days earlier than we had agreed.
You said casually on
Leaving," I've asked Leonardo
"to stay, as I see it's doing Helena good."
And you smiled.
Leonardo abruptly became restless and unhappy.
On Easter Day he went for a long walk in the rain. When he came back, he told Helena he was leaving.
He said they'd meet again.
Then he called Geneva and talked To you for an hour.
That evening he left on the last plane.
During the night I was woken by Helena crying.
She complained of pain in her hip and right leg.
She didn't think she could stand it until morning.
At 5 o'clock I had to phone for the ambulance.
- So Lena's illness was my fault?
- Yes, I think so.
- You mean that her illness...
- Yes.
- You don't seriously mean...
- When Lena was a year old you deserted her.
Then you kept deserting her and me all the time.
When Lena got seriously ill, you sent her to a home.
- It can't be true...
- What can't be true?
Have you any proof to the contrary?
Look at me, Mama. Look at Helena.
There are no excuses.
There is only one truth and one lie.
There can be no forgiveness.
- You can't blame me entirely.
- You expect an exception for you.
You've set up a sort of discount system with life but one day you'll see that your agreement is one-sided.
You'll see you're harboring a guilt,just like everyone else.
What guilt?
Eva darling.
Won't you forgive me for all the wrong I've done?
I'll try to mend my ways.
You've got to teach me, we'll talk to each other.
But help me. I can't go on.
Your hatred is so terrible.
I haven't realized. I've been selfish and childish.
Can't you put your arms around me?
Touch me, at least!
Help me!
Mama!
Come!
Help me!
Mama!
Come!
Poor little Mama, rushing off like that.
She looked so frightened and suddenly so old and tired.
Her face had shrunk and her nose was red from crying.
Now I'll never see her again.
It'll be dark soon, and it's getting cold.
I've got to get home and make dinner for Viktor and Helena.
I can't die now.
I'm afraid to commit suicide, and one day maybe God will want to use me.
Then he'll set me free from my prison.
I feel so shut out, I'm always homesick.
But when I get home
I find it's something else I'm longing for.
Are you stroking my cheek?
Are you whispering in my ear?
Are you with me now?
We'll never leave each other.
There's a light on in Helena's room.
Viktor's there, talking to her.
That's good. Kind of him.
He's telling her Mama has left.
Your mother sent her love.
She was sad and worried. She'd been crying.
Eva has gone for a walk.
She was looking forward so much to seeing her mother.
She hoped for too much.
I hadn't the heart to warn her.
I can't understand what you're saying.
You say you want to...?
Try to speak calmly, otherwise I can't understand.
Eva! Come quickly!
Sometimes I stand here looking at my wife without her knowing.
She's in such distress.
Since Charlotte left so suddenly she has been terribly upset.
She has not been able to sleep.
She says she drove her mother away and can never forgive herself.
- Are you going out?
- Just down to the post office.
Could you please mail this letter for me?
Sure. It's to Charlotte?
Read it if you like. I'm going up to Helena.
" Dear Mama! I realize that I wronged you.
"I met you with demands instead of affection.
"I tormented you with an old hatred that's no longer real.
"I want to ask your forgiveness."
I don't know if this letter will reach you.
I don't even know if you will read it.
Maybe everything is already too late.
But I hope all the same that my discovery will not be in vain.
There is a kind of mercy after all.
I mean the enormous opportunity of getting to take care of each other, to help each other, to show affection.
I will never let you vanish out of my life again.
I'm going to persist.
I won't give up, even if it is too late.
I don't think it is too late.
It must not be too late.
- You got all your stuff?
- Oh, yeah.
When you get there be sure to give us a call.
- We want to know where you are.
- Alright.
- How are you fixed for money?
- l'm OK.
Well, you...
You better take this...
Take this fifty in case you run into a mite of trouble.
You never know what's gonna happen between here and there.
- Thank you.
- You got it.
Well, boy...
Don't worry too much. lt's just the smart people that have to worry.
The Lord will take care of the ignorant ones.
- You paying attention?
- Right.
There ya go.
See ya.

You should care.
He'll be fighting for you. He's going to Vietnam to fight, to save your life.

- To save your life!
Or what you do. l want you out. l tell you, if you want me out, you're gonna have to throw me out.
That's exactly what l'm gonna do, Mr Berger. l'll get the police. l'm not gonna muss myself up fussing with you. l'll have the police get you out, if l have to.

May l give you a word of advice?
Yeah.
Get your ass outta here.
Now.

- That's it, yes.
Thank you. Now listen,
Claude here is in love.
The girl he's in love with is sitting right here in this room.
He just wants to sit here and he just wants to look at her for about five minutes.
He wants to just look at her and maybe have this picture in his head when he's fighting in the jungles. ls that so much to ask? l mean...
Hey! This is for you, man.
Wait a minute. This is what you want.
So, Sheila, is that OK with you? ls it OK if Claude just sits and looks at you for a few minutes before we go?

- What's the matter, don't you trust me?
- Of course not.
Look, man, don't be stupid.
How you gonna get the bread?
You don't know anybody on the streets.
How are you gonna get the bread?
He's not, man. He's just gonna leave us in here to rot. That's all.
No, l can make some calls.
Yeah, call my mama.
You better know what you're doing.
You sure better, George.
What's that?
Excuse me, you're in our way.

You're blocking our way.

What do you want?
What are you...?
Hey, where are you going?
Jesus H Christ!

You can't drive this car.
We're only covered for Dad and me, OK?

- So that's what this is about. Money.

No. Now, look, we really don't have time right now.
We've gotta be in school.
So would you just, stop the car, OK?
Just let me drive.
Sheila!
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Tell him to stop.
Stop.
My friends are still in jail. You could ask your old man for the bread to get 'em out.
Ask my father for the money? Oh, right!
He got us into this.
The least he could do is get us out of it.
- He got you into this?
- Yeah.
He told you to dance on the table?
- No, he didn't tell me that.
- There's a left at the bottom.
- You're really crazy.

Turn left. Right here. Turn left.
Jesus, you missed it.

The school. lt's back there.
Oh, l'm sorry.
Look, we'll help you, OK?
We'll try to get you some money, OK?
So you can just stop the car now and l'll drive, OK?
- When?
- l don't know.
Right after school. How's that?
About four o'clock, OK?
We'll have it for you at four o'clock.
See, that's just what my other problem is, man.
- What?
- You're full of shit.
You won't ask your old man for the bread and Junior's full of shit.
What am l doing here?
No.
- And men?
- Men? Whaddaya mean?
Do you have any sexual attraction towards men?
- You mean if l'm homosexual or somethin'?
- Yeah.
Well, l wouldn't kick Mick Jagger out of my bed but l'm not a homosexual, no.
Well, tell me. Tell me why you're so uptight about having your hair cut.
She asked me why l'm just a hairy guy l'm hairy noon and night
Hair that's a fright l'm hairy high and low
Don't ask me why
Don't know lt's not for lack of bread
Like the Grateful Dead
Darlin'
Give me a head with hair, long beautiful hair
Shinin', gleamin', steamin'
Flaxen, waxen
Gimme it down to there, hair
Shoulder-length or longer
Here, baby, there, mama
Everywhere, daddy
Hair
Grow it
Show it, long as God can grow it, my hair
Let it fly in the breeze and get caught in the trees
Give a home to the fleas in my hair
A home for fleas
A hive for the buzzin' bees
A nest for birds, there ain't no words
For the beauty, the splendour, the wonder of my hair
Flow it, show it
Long as God can grow it
My hair l want it long, straight, curly, fuzzy
Snaggy, shaggy, ratty, matty, oily, greasy, fleecy, shinin', gleamin', steamin'
Flaxen, waxen, knotted, polka-dotted
Twisted, beaded, braided
Powdered, perfumed and confettied, bangled, tangled, spangled
And spaghettied
Say, can you see my eyes? lf you can
Then my hair's too short
Down to here, down to there
Down to there, down to where it stops by itself
They'll be gaga at the go-go when they see me in my toga ln my toga made of blond brilliantined biblical hair
My hair like Jesus wore it
Hallelujah, l adore it
Hallelujah, Mary loved her son
Why don't my mother love me?
Hair
Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it
My hair
Flow it, show it
Long as God can grow it
My hair

Listen, how's she gonna get home? She doesn't have her stuff, she has no bread.
You better get that stuff to her.

Black boys are delicious
Chocolate-flavoured love
Liquorice lips like candy
Keep my cocoa handy l have such a sweet tooth
When it comes to love
Once l tried a diet
Of quiet rest, no sweets
But l went nearly crazy
And l went clearly crazy
Because l really crave for
Chocolate-flavoured treats
Black boys are nutritious
Black boys fill me up
Black boys are so damn yummy
They satisfy my tummy l have such a sweet tooth
When it comes to love

Are so pretty
Skin as smooth as milk
White boys are so pretty
Hair like Chinese silk
White boys give me goose bumps
White boys give me chills
When they touch my shoulder
That's the touch that kills
My mother calls them lilies l call 'em piccadillies
My daddy warns me to stay away
But l say come and play
White boys are so groovy
White boys are so tough
Every time they're near me l just can't get enough
White boys are so sexy
Sexy
They're so long and lean
Love those sprayed-on trousers l love the love machine
My brother calls them rubble
They're my kind of trouble
My daddy warns me no
But l say, white boys, go!
White boys are so lovely
Beautiful as girls
Love to run my fingers
And toes through all their curls
Give me a tall
A lean
- A sexy
- A pretty

- Oh, Lord, don't excite me
Give me a white boy

Pretending it's our chore
They ship us off to war ln this dive we rediscover sensation
Walking in space
We find the purpose of peace
The beauty of life
You can no longer hide
Our eyes are open

Sheila. Out of the car. Sheila.
What? Sheila! l'm not into any heavy preference trip, y'know, like who the father is. l don't care. l think they're both beautiful. Don't you?
But how can you not care about something like that? lf a woman carries a child, she should know who the father is, don't you think?
Well, l... l admit that l have this dilemma.
But it'll be resolved real soon. lt's not a big crisis or anything. lt's not a world war. l don't know what you're so uptight about. l fell in love with someone.
We had a child.
We were going to get married.
That's why l'm uptight.
- Yeah?
- And you're holding it up.
No, l'm not holding it up.
See, you don't see the way it is.
This is really, like, a great thing that's happened.
To all of us. Everybody's happy about it.
The guys are really happy. l think it'd be great if you could, y'know, be happy about it, too.
- You're crazy.
- Yeah. We're all crazy. Let's shake on it.
Let's not.
Come on!
Attention!
Stand at ease! lf all you men could be standing where l'm standing, and seeing what l'm seeing, you'd know how it feels to be truly proud of our country.
The United States Army is the greatest fighting force in the world.
And now you men are going to be thousands of miles away from home in a few days, and you'd better take some of that greatness with you.
And this afternoon, while you're on leave, you'd better take some with you, too.

Get the doggone coat on!
Quickly! What's the matter with you troops?
You act like you don't wanna go! l don't wanna go, but if you gotta go, l gotta go, we all gotta go.
Let's move it! Now! Right now!
Let's get on the red line. Let's go!
Let's go! Move with a purpose!
What in the hell are you waiting on?
Get that web gear on! l want that rain bucket on your head! l want that duffel bag on the red line.
Soldier, there's a war on!
Move, hurry up!
Now listen up. When l call your name l want you to sound off smartly, and move out.
- Calpo!
- Yes, sir!
- Sumner!
- Yes, sir!
- Harrison!
- Yes, sir!
- Brock!
- Yes, sir!
Bukowski!
Bukowski!
Bukowski!
You'd better get your head outta your ass!
Let's go! This way, soldier!
Let's go. Move out! You better move, soldier!
Hey, where are you going?
What's the matter with you? l said put the duffel bag on that truck!
The vehicle right there!
Let's go! Get it on there!
Now!
We starve
Look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation
Of moving paper fantasies
Listening for the new-told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere lnside something there is a rush of
Greatness
Who knows what stands in front of
Our lives? l fashion my future
On films in space
Silence tells me secretly
Everything
Manchester, England
Across the Atlantic Sea
And l'm a genius l believe in God
And l believe that God believes in Claude
That's me
We starve
Look at one another short of breath
Berger!
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation
Berger?
Of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new-told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Singing our space songs on a spider-web sitar
Life is around you and in you
Except for Timothy Leary, dearie
Let the sun shine
Let the sun shine in
The sun shine in
Darlin'
Give me a head with hair, long beautiful hair
Shinin', gleamin', steamin', flaxen, waxen
Gimme it down to there, hair
Shoulder-length or longer
Here, baby, there, mama
Everywhere, daddy
Hair
Flow it, show it,
Long as God can grow it, my hair
Let it fly in the breeze and get caught in the trees
Give a home to the fleas in my hair
A home for fleas
A hive for the buzzin' bees
A nest for birds, there ain't no words for the beauty, the splendour
The wonder of my hair
Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it, my hair l want it long, straight, curly, fuzzy, snaggy, shaggy, ratty, matty
Oily, greasy, fleecy, shinin', gleamin', steamin', flaxen, waxen
Knotted, polka-dotted
Twisted, beaded, braided
Powdered, perfumed and confettied bangled, tangled, spangled
And spaghettied
Say, can you see my eyes? lf you can then my hair's too short
Down to here, down to there, down to there, down to where it stops by itself
They'll be gaga at the go-go when they see me in my toga
My toga made of blond brilliantined biblical hair
My hair like Jesus wore it
Hallelujah, l adore it
Hallelujah, Mary loved her son
Why don't my mother love me?
Hair
Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it
My hair
Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it
My hair
They'll be gaga at the go-go when they see me in my toga
My toga made of blond brilliantined biblical hair
My hair like Jesus wore it
Hallelujah, l adore it
Hallelujah, Mary loved her son
Why don't my mother love me?
Hair
Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it
My hair
Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it
My hair
Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it
My hair
STEWARDESS: The captain has turned on the No Smoking sign.
Please extinguish all smoking materials.
Make sure your seats are in the upright position...
... and your seatbelts fastened in preparation for our arrival in LA.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Okay. Bye-bye, now.
Thank you.
Take care. Watch your step, there.
Goodbye.
[Woman snarling]
[Screaming]
THORNDYKE: No!
WOMAN: Harry! I'm so glad to see you!
[Woman laughing joyously]
[Clearing throat]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
MAN: Sir?
MAN: Just a moment, please.
THORNDYKE: Yes?
MAN: Just come with me, please.
- What is this about?
- I'll explain in due time. Just follow me.
- You've obviously made a mistake.
- We can clear this up if you'll follow me.
THORNDYKE:
I hope there's an explanation for all this.
I'm in the dark.
There's no reason why you should...
MAN: This way, sir, please.
In the toilet?
THORNDYKE: I demand an explanation.
MAN: How about this?
- Oh, my God!
- Do you find me attractive?
- You're not a cop!
- They wouldn't take me!
Excuse me. I have to run now.
Why? Don't run away from your feelings! Wait!
Where are you going?
Don't be so gauche. We're all doing it!
What a dramatic airport!
BROPHY: Dr. Thorndyke?
Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke? Hold it!
Who are you?
I'm Brophy. I work at the Institute.
I came to pick you up.
- I'm going to be your driver and sidekick.
- How do you do?
Why the picture-taking?
I love to take pictures.
I'm very photogenic.
I even develop them myself.
I have my own darkroom.
Please hold the camera, Doc.
I'll get the trunk.
THORNDYKE: Fabulous.
I got it. I got it...
I ain't got it!
I'll get it.
I got it...
I ain't got it.
[Loud thud]
I got it...
I ain't got it.
[Loud thud]
- Where's the car?
- Over there.
- Would you mind opening the trunk?
- I'll open the trunk.
THORNDYKE: I'll save us a little time.
You got it. You got it...
There we go.
BROPHY: Doc, I sure am glad you're taking over as the new head of the asylum.
We haven't had a real chief since Dr. Ashley died.
I just hope I do as good a job as Ashley did.
- He was a brilliant psychiatric innovator.
- Yeah, innovator.
When it was announced that you would take over, Dr. Montague blew his top.
Between me, you and the steering wheel...
...I guess Montague figured he had the job tucked away in his back pocket.
If you get my drift.
Is that so?
And then, from out of the blue...
...they go and get you, a professor from Harvard University. No offense.
None taken.
Boy, I tell you, it was a real shock to everybody when Ashley died.
The guy was in tiptop shape!
One can never predict a heart attack.
Heart attack? Don't make me laugh.
Brophy, what are you saying?
If you ask me,
I think Dr. Ashley was the victim of...
... foul play.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Foul play? Brophy, your imagination is getting the best of you.
Let's not forget that you are working in a psychiatric institution...
...which is conducive to fantasy.
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm wrong.
I know I'm right.
[Intercom buzzes]
Brophy here with the new head shrink.
[Groans]
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
BROPHY: Well, Doc, here's your new home.
WENTWORTH: Dr. Thorndyke, I am simply delighted to meet you in person.
I've read everything you've ever written on psychiatry.
Your lectures, your monographs, your books.
I'm absolutely thrilled that you're taking over the Institute.
Thank you...
- Wentworth, Dr. Philip Wentworth.
- A pleasure.
I've been with the Institute for two years.
I just know that things are going to change for the better now that you're here.
You see, ever since Dr. Ashley died...
...strange things have been happening here.
MONTAGUE: Wentworth!
The eminent Dr. Thorndyke.
It's a great day here at the Institute for the Very, Very Nervous.
May I say that we have been looking forward with anticipation to your arrival.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Dr. Charles Montague.
I was in charge till now.
[Bones crunching]
[Diesel clears throat loudly]
Allow me to introduce Nurse Diesel, my right-hand man. Woman.
DIESEL: Dr. Thorndyke. How do you do?
Charlotte Diesel.
I left a complete medical file of everyone in the Institute in your room.
I'm sure you'll want to rest before you meet the rest of the staff.
Dinner is served at 8:00 in the private dining room.
Those who are tardy do not get fruit cup.
Excuse me.
Dr. Thorndyke, may I say...
DIESEL: Charles.
MONTAGUE: Bye.
Do you see what I mean?
I'm trying to tell you...
DIESEL: Wentworth!
WENTWORTH: Goodbye.
BROPHY: I got it. I got it...
[Loud thud]
I ain't got it.
[Knock on door]
THORNDYKE: Come in.
Thorndyke. My Richard!
Professor Little-old-man!
Lilloman. Lilloman. Nobody gets it right.
Little-old-man, Little-old-man...
Richard!
[Chuckling]
My best pupil.
My best student which I ever had.
A patient comes to you.
He is suffering from Belden's Hysteria.
He has a seizure right in your office.
What do you give him?
Two cc's of aqueous Thorazine coupled with one cc of Somadiazine.
Good. And the most important thing?
Never take a personal check.
That's my boy. That's my good pupil.
Professor, it's so good to see you.
Please, sit down. Let's talk.
To sit? Ja.
Richard, I am so proud of you.
So proud, my boy.
Head of your class at Johns Hopkins.
Associate professor at Dartmouth.
Full professor at Harvard.
Winner of the Nobel Prize. And now...
...the head of the most prestigious psychiatric institute on the West Coast.
[Crying]
I'm sorry, excuse me.
When you get old, you get very emotional.
Oops. I blew too fast.
- Here, Professor, some tissues.
- Danke schön to you.
- Professor?
- Ja?
- I had no idea you were working here.
- Working?
Working is a big word. I'm a consultant.
[Snickering]
It's a fancy title for a part-time job.
I come in two hours a day.
I don't bother them. They don't bother me.
Your predecessor, Dr. Ashley, hired me.
It is a shame he died so all of a sudden.
He was going to make some very big changes around here...
...and then...
[Exhales]
[Eerie instrumental music]
Did you see your view outside?
Oh, it is spectacular.
I've been meaning to, but I've been so busy unpacking I haven't had a chance.
Unpack another time.
Come, Richard, I insist.
You come and see right now!
If you insist.
LILLOMAN: Come, Richard, this will be a treat for you. Come, Ja.
Is this not the perfect time of the day? Look!
- Very nice.
- Come over here. Here you can see better.
- Come.
- It's beautiful.
Come here to the edge and you can look down. Look down!
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Screaming]
[Shrieking]
LILLOMAN: Richard!
My boy, are you all right?
Come back inside, my goodness!
Come over here, sitzen Sie. Goodness me.
Thank you, Professor. I'm sorry.
I don't know what came over me.
I know what came over you.
High Anxiety, you've still got it.
It's probably the excitement and tension of taking over this new post. I'm...
...sure it will pass.
Bullshit!
These things do not let go.
High Anxiety can be a dangerous enemy.
If left unchecked, it could cost you your life.
[Dramatic instrumental music blasts]
Tomorrow...
First thing tomorrow, we have our first session of psychoanalysis.
My boy, I have not had you on the couch for a long time.
My boy, I promise, we will beat this thing.
Goodbye.
But, Professor, it is really nece...
It is "nece." I know what is "nece."
Don't tell me what is "nece."
I tell you what is "nece."
[Door closes]
[Crickets chirping]
Yes, as I was saying, it came to my attention that...
...just before Dr. Ashley's untimely death...
...he was planning to make some very big changes here at the Institute.
Do any of you know specifically what those changes might be?
Well, for one thing he wanted to change...
The drapes.
The drapes?
The drapes.
He wanted to change the drapes in the psychotic game room.
That was the extent of the big change?
The drapes?
Yes, Dr. Ashley felt that color...
...has a lot to do with the well-being of the emotionally disturbed.
To some extent that is true, I imagine.
MONTAGUE: Only 30 seconds late.
You're so strict.
[Slurping]
Gentlemen...
...and Nurse Diesel...
... may I propose a toast?
To our new leader:
Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke.
Long may he reign.
I thank you.
[Mysterious instrumental music]
[Sighing appreciatively]
Yes, that's an excellent brandy.
You can tell by just sniffing the aroma.
It's much better than the brandy we used to have.
Dr. Montague, I'm curious.
What exactly is the rate of patient recovery here at the Institute?
Rate of patient recovery?
I'll have that for you in a moment.
Once in a blue moon.
Once in a blue moon.
Dr. Thorndyke.
Unfortunately...
...the rate of recovery in the classroom...
...is much higher than it is in real life.
We're dealing with sick people here, you understand.
Dangerously sick people!
[Montague grunting]
Dr. Thorndyke?
Will you be at the Annual Psychiatric
Convention in San Francisco next week?
Yes, I...
I think someone should attend, don't you?
I'd be delighted to have the honor.
I'm sure you'll have a nice time.
Thank you.
Up and down.
Side, side.
In and out.
Side, side.
Up and down.
Side, side.
In and out.
Side, side.
[Gargling]
Oh, my God!
"Welcome! The violent ward."
BROPHY: Doc! Is everything all right?
Somebody just threw an enormous rock through my window.
BROPHY: Jeez!
A guy like that should be put away.
Look at the size of this thing!
Here, let me get rid of it for you. I got it!
I got it!
Brophy, get it tomorrow.
Yeah.
[Rock thuds]
[Distant screaming]
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Come on!
[Fast-paced suspenseful instrumental music]
[Distant screaming]
BROPHY:
It's coming from Nurse Diesel's room.
Is everything all right in there?
Nurse Diesel! Are you all right?
Yes?
We heard some weird noises emanating from your room. We were worried.
Weird noises? It was the TV.
Sorry it disturbed you. I've turned it down.
Is there anything else? It is rather late.
No, we were concerned. Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- TV? Well, you could have fooled me.
- Yeah, the TV.
It was probably the TV.
- Good night.
- That was no TV.
[Military-style instrumental music]
- Who was it?
- It was Thorndyke.
- You're making too much noise.
- I can't help it, you're hurting me.
- You're going too hard tonight.
- Get off it.
I know you better than you know yourself.
You live for bondage and discipline.
[Groaning]
Too much bondage. Not enough discipline!
DIESEL: You want discipline?
I'll give you discipline.
[Montague groaning]
Yes!
Yes. I'm sorry!
Yes! It feels so good!
[Birds chirping]
[Intercom buzzes]
Yes?
NASAL FEMALE VOICE: Dr. Thorndyke,
Dr. Montague is here to see you.
Please take your hand away from your nose and say that again.
NORMAL VOICE: Dr. Montague is here.
THORNDYKE: Thank you. Send him in.
THORNDYKE: Thank you for coming.
MONTAGUE: I'm sorry I'm late.
It took longer than anticipated for my rounds this morning.
THORNDYKE: Please have a seat.
MONTAGUE: Thanks.
[Montague winces]
THORNDYKE: I'm a little disturbed.
MONTAGUE: Yes, Dr. Thorndyke?
I've studied some of these case histories and once in a while...
...I come across a patient who behaves in a rational and normal manner.
Zachary Cartwright III, for instance.
It seems his family is paying
$12,000 a month to the Institute.
According to this file he should have been released months ago.
Well...
These case histories are really so sketchy.
They hardly draw a true picture of the patient's psychosis.
Cartwright is a perfect example.
One moment he can be perfectly rational and lucid...
...the next he's a living loony tune.
Do you mind if we examine him together?
He is just outside my door.
Mind? Why should I mind?
After all, you're in charge here.
You can examine anyone you want.
THORNDYKE:
Please send Mr. Cartwright in. Thank you.
THORNDYKE: Mr. Cartwright, have a seat.
You know Dr. Montague, don't you?
- Hello, Dr. Montague.
- Hello, Zack.
Tell me, do you know why you're here at the Institute?
Yes, I was brought in two years ago.
I was suffering from nervous exhaustion.
I used to get sharp pains in my neck and dreamt about werewolves.
- Werewolves?
- Werewolves.
And in the two years you've been here, do you feel you've made any progress?
I never get those pains anymore...
... and it's been 6 months since I had a dream about a werewolf.
6 months since you had your last dream about a werewolf.
THORNDYKE: Tell me frankly. If you were returned to the community today...
...could you function in a happy, healthy, normal and productive manner?
I think so. I feel pretty good.
[Screams]
- What's the matter?
- That pain just came back.
MONTAGUE: See how unpredictable he is?
THORNDYKE: Help him to the couch.
Sit right here. Put your head back.
Breathe deeply. Try to relax.
MONTAGUE: Easy.
CARTWRIGHT: I'll try.
This pain that you haven't experienced in such a long time...
...has suddenly reappeared for no reason?
- I don't know what it is.
- This is such a strange experience.
- The pain is going away.
- Good. Breathe deeply.
I feel perfectly fine.
[Screams]
What is it?
- Cartwright, is it that same pain?
- Yes!
- Let me examine you.
- No!
THORNDYKE: I just want to help you!
- I don't understand.
- I don't understand it, either.
Relax, take it easy.
[Cartwright screaming]
THORNDYKE: Take it easy!
CARTWRIGHT: Go away!
- Montague, what are we going to do?
- I don't know! Take it easy, Zack.
[Screaming]
ORDERLY: Cartwright!
THORNDYKE: His feet.
ORDERLY: Got him.
[Cartwright gasping]
THORNDYKE: Take him back to his room.
Give him a sedative.
Make it a big one.
[Sighs]
Sad. I've never seen anything quite like that.
- And he was doing so well.
- I know.
- It is sad, tears your heart apart.
- Yes.
- There's that flashing again.
- Flashing?
It started this morning and here it is again.
It seems to be coming from somewhere...
...up there.
- Yes, the North Wing.
Room 35, I'd say.
It stopped. Who's in that room?
MONTAGUE: A patient named Brisbane.
THORNDYKE: Brisbane.
- Arthur Brisbane? The industrialist?
- Yes, I think that's the one.
- How long has he been here?
- About 18 months.
18 months?
I didn't come across his name in the files.
It must be an oversight.
I'd like to meet him.
But he's hopeless.
You don't want to meet him.
I'd like to meet him right after lunch.
All right. As you wish.
- I'll arrange it for you.
- Thank you.
Nurse Diesel? Dr. Montague here.
Dr. Thorndyke would like to meet
Arthur Brisbane right after lunch.
Good.
Ou-yay ow-knay at-whay o-tay o-day.
Et it-gay?
MONTAGUE:
Everything will be taken care of.
There it goes again.
[Screaming]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Gasping]
Falling.
Mamma! Falling!
LILLOMAN: Fight it, Thorndyke. Fight it.
You must fight it, do you hear me?
Fight your fears.
The only way to overcome High Anxiety is to fight it.
- Fight!
- Fight!
THORNDYKE: Fight it.
LILLOMAN: Ja, fight it!
- Fight.
- Good.
LILLOMAN: Good. Fight it.
Good, fight it.
Ja, good, that's the way to fight it!
Fight it, ja. Good.
[Lilloman groans]
LILLOMAN: That's all right.
Get out that hostility. Good.
Fight.
[Lilloman groans]
You want to fight? All right.
Fight if you want. Fight.
I'll give you a fight you don't forget.
Come on, show me your stuff.
Show me your good stuff.
All right, I'll give you...
[Laughs]
Come on, get up, you little punk!
Stand up and fight! Come on...
MONTAGUE: Professor! What are you doing? This is unseemly behavior.
What are you doing? Stop!
MONTAGUE: Come on, boys. We came to see a fight, not a dance. Let's go.
MONTAGUE:
Professor, what happened here?
I put him under hypnosis.
He will be out very soon.
You see, we have been running a series of analytic sessions...
...to try to help him overcome the very serious illness...
...known as High Anxiety.
- High Anxiety?
- Ja.
[Montague stifles laughter]
Do you mean to say that Dr. Richard Thorndyke...
...one of the world's greatest psychiatric authorities...
...is suffering from High Anxiety?
Ja, but you would not breathe a word of this to anyone, would you?
Professor, may I remind you that I am also a professional?
I am shocked that you would think
I'd say a word about this.
Hey, everybody, guess who has High Anxiety?
[Concerned sighing]
LILLOMAN: Richard?
THORNDYKE: Falling, Mamma.
Falling. Mamma. Falling.
Richard, I'm going to bring you out.
I'm going to bring you out. I bring you out!
- Richard, my boy, Richard!
- Professor!
You'll never believe what I just went through. It was horrible!
I would believe. But there will be no more sessions for a while.
- So, go get yourself a little rest, my boy.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Professor.
- Ja, auf Wiedersehen.
[Sighs]
Let us see, here.
"Mamma, I am falling."
[Sighs]
[Winces]
MONTAGUE: Norton, this is our new chief,
Dr. Thorndyke.
MONTAGUE: He'd like to see Mr. Brisbane.
NORTON: Certainly.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. Thorndyke.
- Pleasure to meet you, Norton.
Forgive me for prying.
What happened to your mustache?
As you know, we get some very violent patients in this wing.
Last week, I guess I wasn't on my toes...
...and one of them reached out and ripped off half of my mustache.
- That must have been awful.
- You'll never know the pain.
It can get quite dicey up here at times.
- Well, shall we go?
- Follow me.
Hey, Norton! You missing something?
[Cackles]
[Norton clears his throat]
[Snarling sounds]
[Barking]
[Whining]
That's Arthur Brisbane? The industrialist?
[Barking]
No. Down, Brisbane, down. Bad Brisbane.
Sit up. All right.
Don't worry, he won't bite.
Just let him smell you.
- He thinks he's a cocker spaniel.
- Cocker spaniel?
[Brisbane snarling]
THORNDYKE: Very good.
I've never seen anything like...
Down! Sit!
Stay!
THORNDYKE: Amazing! The most complex psychic phenomenon I've ever witnessed.
I once read a paper when I was in college about this, I think it was Otto Rank.
It might have been Kraft-Ebbing.
About a woman in Vienna...
...who thought that she was an animal of some kind, an antelope...
THORNDYKE: What the hell are you...
MONTAGUE: No! Stop that!
We don't do that with strangers. Bad dog!
[Montague shrieks]
Get his leash, Norton.
[Growling]
[Barking]
Extraordinary!
How could a creature have the wherewithal to try to contact me by flashing a mirror?
Well, cockers are very bright, you know.
That's true. That's very true.
[Snarling]
WENTWORTH:
Please understand, I can't go on.
I swear to God, I won't say a word, but I can't take it any longer.
DIESEL: You're just as much a part of this as the rest of us.
No one is quitting. Do you hear me?
- No one.
- But I can't sleep at night!
What we're doing is wrong.
Don't you understand, it's wrong!
I've got to get out of here. I'm trapped!
I feel like I'm caught in a web.
DIESEL:
Quiet, you fool! The window is open!
[Foreboding instrumental music]
All right.
Perhaps...
...I've been too harsh.
You are free to leave the Institute this evening.
Thank you, Nurse Diesel.
And I promise I won't say anything to anybody. Thank you.
I know you won't.
[Wentworth whimpers]
I know you won't.
[Truck horn blares]
[Radio plays loud upbeat pop music]
[Tires screeching]
[Loud music continues]
[Screaming]
Busted eardrums?
That's a very strange symptom for a cerebral hemorrhage.
According to the coroner's report, he did suffer from a cerebral hemorrhage.
THORNDYKE:
I can't go to San Francisco now.
Dr. Thorndyke, there's nothing you can do.
If we receive any additional information about Wentworth, we'll call you.
It's important that you attend the psychiatric convention. Remember...
...you are representing the Institute.
Yes, enjoy yourself, for God's sake.
Get your mind off the Wentworth murder.
[Thwacking]
Accident. Have a good time.
I did work long and hard on that speech.
[Murmur agreement]
I'm going. You've convinced me. Brophy!
I'm looking for my camera,
I want to get one last shot.
Please, Brophy, not now.
BROPHY: Hold it!
- Okay, let's hit the road.
- Well, see you in three days.
MONTAGUE: Bye-bye.
THORNDYKE: Bye-bye.
MONTAGUE: Enjoy yourself.
THORNDYKE: 'Bye.
I think you punctured something with that last shot.
You do everything too hard. Too hard.
Come to my room right after dinner.
Not tonight. I'm too tired.
I'm going to turn in early.
- I'll let you wear my underwear.
- I'll be there.
BROPHY: Thorndyke and Brophy.
CLERK: Yes, sir.
PORTER: Thank you.
CLERK: Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke?
THORNDYKE: Yes.
Sir, very good. Here we go, you're all set.
Wow. Talk about modern.
You and Mr. Brophy are in 1702 and 1703.
Excuse me. I thought I'd specifically requested a room on a lower floor.
- Nothing higher than three.
- We had 201 all set for you.
But a Mr. MacGuffin called and told us to change it to the 17th floor.
I'm sorry, we can't do a thing about it today. We're all booked up.
Come on, Doc.
It's only for a couple of nights.
I guess it'll be all right. It's just...
...I really don't like high places.
Dennis, will you take Dr. Thorndyke to his room, please?
DENNIS: Anything I can get you?
Yes. I'd like a newspaper.
I'll get you one and meet you at the elevators.
- Please don't forget. It's rather important.
- All right, already.
I want to see if there's any mention of Wentworth's death.
Doc, there are the elevators.
- Come on, Doc.
- I'm coming.
Here we go. Straight to the top.
[Thorndyke gasping]
DENNIS: Quite a view, isn't it?
Here we are. Top floor. Top of the hotel.
You can't get any higher.
- We're pretty high.
- We know it. We know we're high.
That we know. That part we know.
[Gasps]
[Eerie instrumental music]
DENNIS: Excuse me. This way.
This way, please. Right around the corner.
BROPHY: Hey, Doc, look at this.
What a view. This is spectacular.
I can see it from here.
It's very nice. Very nice indeed.
[Screams]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Gasping]
Are you all right, Doc?
I'm all right, Brophy.
ATTENDANT: I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't know anyone was there.
You fellas want to see your rooms or not?
BROPHY:
[Whispering] Let's get out of here.
[Brophy sighing]
If you would have gone over you'd be smashed like corned beef hash.
Your brains would have splattered all over the lobby...
Brophy, please.
Right here is 1702. You're in 1703.
Here's your key.
I'll bring your bag in a minute.
THORNDYKE: See you later. Thank you.
- Here you go. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
- Anything else I can get you, sir?
- What happened to my newspaper?
The newsstand didn't have any and I didn't want to run around the corner.
I want that newspaper.
It's very important.
All right, I'll get your paper.
A hassle.
THORNDYKE: Don't forget.
DENNIS: All right!
What's so important about a lousy, crummy newspaper?
Dennis? Dr. Thorndyke in room 1702 just called down to remind you not...
I know. Get the newspaper!
Get the stinking newspaper!
[Ominous instrumental music]
Here!
[Thorndyke gasping]
Here's your paper!
Here's your paper!
Happy now?
[Door slams]
That kid gets no tip.
[Knock on door]
Who is it?
[Knock on door]
Who is it?
It's not the bellboy, is it?
[Knock on door]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Get away from the door.
[Wheezing]
- Who are you?
- Get away from me.
- Just a second...
- Be quiet, they'll hear you. Don't move.
- Go inside. Go to your room.
- Go to my room.
- The drapes! Close the drapes.
- The drapes. Close the drapes.
Close the drapes.
WOMAN:
Close the other one. Get down! Lower.
Good. Quick, come here.
Get up.
Sit down. Not there, here.
- Here?
- There.
Will you please tell me who are you and who are they?
Quick, make believe you know me terribly well.
[Exclaims indignantly]
[Door slams]
What's your sign?
I'm sorry, it's unlisted.
Boy, you sure blow hot and cold.
No offense.
Will you please tell me who you are?
My name is Victoria Brisbane.
My father is Arthur Brisbane.
You're the cocker's daughter?
VICTORIA: Have you seen my father at the Institute? Is he all right?
He's fine. He's coming along fine.
He's very affectionate. He licked me.
He what?
Well, he thinks he's a dog these days.
- A dog?
- Dog. Yes.
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Not at all.
I see. A dog.
Dr. Thorndyke, I assure you my father is just as sane as I am.
18 months ago, he suffered a nervous breakdown.
He went into the Institute for a rest and has been a virtual prisoner ever since.
Frankly, Doctor, I fear for his life.
Miss Brisbane, I assure you
I am a competent psychiatrist.
I've examined your father and I must tell you, in my professional capacity...
...he is deeply disturbed.
[Knock on door]
Don't answer it. If they know I'm here, they'll harm my father.
BROPHY: You're late, they're waiting.
THORNDYKE: I'll be right down.
That's Brophy, my driver. He's all right.
Miss Brisbane, I'm terribly sorry.
I must go. They're waiting for me.
Don't you believe what I'm telling you?
It's not that I don't care.
You don't understand.
I'm the principal speaker at the convention.
I must go. I'm very late.
Why don't we meet later at the bar?
We'll talk about it then.
Fine. Later at the bar, that's perfect.
THORNDYKE: Let's go.
Here we go.
See? There's no one here.
There are no enemies.
There's nothing to worry about.
Let me see you to the elevator.
Right this way.
Nice hotel, isn't it?
Kind of high.
[Foreboding instrumental music]
[Audience chattering]
May I have your attention, please?
Fellow members of the American Psychiatric Convention...
... it is a pleasure and an honor...
... to present the new head of the Psycho-Neurotic Institute...
... for the Very, Very Nervous.
Winner of the Nobel Prize for his works in the use of chemotherapy...
... on severe psychosis.
The distinguished
Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke.
Thank you, Dr. Colburn.
Fellow analysts, psychiatrists...
... psychologists and laypeople...
... today I would like to discuss...
... some of the lesser known aspects of Psychobiological Therapy.
100 years ago, psychology was akin to witchcraft.
But some of these great people, these giants behind me...
... gave us a nice living.
KILLER: I don't know what they said.
I only know that they met.
What do you want me to do? Kill him?
If you want me to kill him, I'll kill him.
I don't have to kill him, but I'd like to kill him.
I killed Ashley and Wentworth. Another killing or two won't make any difference.
It would make me happy.
I'd like to kill them both.
I think it would be better if I killed them both.
Well, let me kill just one, then.
Whichever one you want.
All right. I'll wait.
But the minute you say kill them,
I'll kill them.
I'd love to kill them.
It would give me immense pleasure.
THORNDYKE: And so, in conclusion...
... let me reiterate...
... that there are no rules.
That each patient is a supreme individual endowed with those qualities...
... that distinguish the human being...
... from the slime from which he emerged.
Thank you.
THORNDYKE: Yes, Dr. Colburn.
COLBURN: May I ask you a question?
THORNDYKE: Certainly.
Dr. Thorndyke, you mentioned in your address that penis envy...
...should be deemed an antiquated psychiatric concept.
Could you expand on that?
THORNDYKE: Of course.
Let's remember that the term "penis envy"...
... was created in a predominantly male atmosphere...
MAN: Excuse me.
Sorry I'm late.
Forgive me for bringing the kids.
I couldn't get a sitter.
THORNDYKE: Please, have a seat.
As I was saying, in a world of predominantly male-oriented psychology...
... it was only natural to arrive at the term, pee...
Pee...
"Peepee envy."
Are you saying there's absolutely no validity to...
...peepee envy?
It has no more validity than if a man envied a woman's...
... balloons.
Dr. Thorndyke, do you feel that the trauma of toilet training...
...has a bearing on the sexual future of the adolescent?
Toilet training. That's a vast area.
Let's be more specific.
Are we talking about...
... number one or cocky-doody?
For argument's sake, let's say cocky-doody.
THORNDYKE:
I'd say professionally, cocky-doody...
... has very little to do with the future sexual development of the adolescent.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Let me backtrack for a second.
The female erogenous zone.
- You mean the balloons?
- No. Lower, much lower.
Where the babies come out. The woowoo.
The woowoo?
THORNDYKE: Yes. The woowoo.
Perhaps the most significant psychological feminine component...
... known to mankind.
[Cheers and whistles]
[Soft cocktail music]
Here we are. A B&B and B&B&B.
Thank you.
Dr. Richard H. Thorndyke.
What does the "H" stand for?
[Thorndyke mumbles]
What?
Harpo.
My mother loved the Marx Brothers.
She saw all their movies.
She named me Harpo.
Harpo?
I like it. It's very refreshing.
There are certain names that you just don't hear very often these days.
- Anyway, here is to Daddy's recovery.
- To Daddy's recovery.
- Feeling better?
- Dr. Thorndyke.
You'll never know how wonderful you've made me feel...
...by allowing me to visit my father.
I can't believe it.
I'm actually going to see him.
Miss Brisbane, I must warn you.
You may be in for quite a shock.
I don't care.
I just know that if I can see him and speak with him that everything will be all right.
Hey, it's song time here at the piano bar.
That means I lay back and let you come forward and sing a few songs.
How about you, sir?
How about you, ma'am?
No?
How about you, Doc?
How about giving us a tune?
THORNDYKE: Me?
PLAYER: Yes.
I don't sing. No.
I really don't sing.
Not professionally, anyway.
MAN 1: Come on, Doc. Give us a song.
MAN 2: We'd love it.
MAN 3:
Come on. You can do it.
Go ahead. It'll be fun.
All right. Do you know High Anxiety?
You got it. Is B flat okay?
B flat?
PLAYER: The key.
THORNDYKE: The key.
That's fine, sure. I guess so. Sing in here?
Okay. Anytime.
[Piano music begins]
[Sings] "High anxiety
"Whenever you're near
"High anxiety
"It's you that I fear
"My heart's afraid to fly
"It's crashed before
"But then you take my hand
"My heart starts to soar
"Once more
"High anxiety
"It's always the same
"It's you that I blame
"It's very clear to me
"I've got to give in
"High anxiety
"You win"
- Hiya, Tex. Where are you from?
- Cincinnati.
Great town. Love that big, red machine.
Ease up on the linguine.
[Audience chuckle]
Hello, young lovers, whoever you are...
What do I spy? A little grain of rice.
Newly married?
This morning.
This morning, folks.
And they said it wouldn't last.
[Audience chuckle]
THORNDYKE: "But then you take my hand
"My heart starts to soar
"Once more"
Key change. "High anxiety
"It's always the same
"It's you that I blame
"It's very clear to me
"I've got to give in
"High anxiety"
And remember, folks. Be good to your parents, they've been good to you.
"You win"
[Thorndyke sighs]
Jeepers, Richard, that was terrific.
- Thank you.
- I am so impressed.
- Ever thought of singing professionally?
- No.
The big bucks are in psychiatry.
- It's so much more emotionally rewarding.
- Exactly.
- To help people.
- Exactly.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
I'll be right back.
I just have to go to the little girls' room.
Of course.
THORNDYKE: Let me get this.
VICTORIA: Sorry.
THORNDYKE: Here you go.
VICTORIA: Thank you.
Forgive me for prying, but who is this gentleman?
What are you talking about? That's Daddy.
Are you trying to tell me that this man is Arthur Brisbane, your father?
Of course.
This is not the man I met at the Institute.
Something is very, very wrong.
MONTAGUE: What are we going to do?
This is serious. He knows.
He's seen the picture.
He knows that's not the real Brisbane we showed him.
More coffee, please.
Charlotte, what will we do?
We'll have to kill him.
We'll have to let him kill him.
That's all we need now. Another killing.
Give me a cookie.
First Ashley, then Wentworth.
We can't kill Thorndyke without the police suspecting something.
MONTAGUE: Pass me the cream, please.
What are we going to do?
Supposing he goes to the police?
I've thought of that.
He won't go to the police if he can't go to the police.
MONTAGUE:
I don't understand. Sugar, please.
What do you mean if he can't go to the police? Why can't he?
Because the police will be looking for him.
Why would the police be looking for him?
Because Thorndyke...
...is going to kill somebody.
DIESEL: Here. Finish your strudel.
Here are the keys.
Weren't you supposed to check out tomorrow?
I don't know.
Early this morning, the doc called.
Said we have to get back to the Institute.
This joint is really luxurious.
I have to take a few shots.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
You got some joint, here.
Let me take it now. I like this joint.
It's beautiful. It's terrific. It's gorgeous.
That's beautiful.
The elevators. Good.
Dr. Thorndyke.
Dr. Thorndyke.
I hear you're leaving.
What about the seminar this afternoon?
[Screaming]
[Fast-paced dramatic instrumental music]
[Elevator dings]
Dr. Thorndyke?
Yes?
Here's a little present for you.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
What is this? Who are you?
[Sinister cackle]
Why are you... Wait!
Who are you? What does this mean?
What does this mean?
[Woman screams]
That's the man!
That's the man who shot him!
No, wait. You don't understand.
This is not my gun.
Oh, my God.
The man is dead.
I didn't... He shot him, I'm sure.
He took off a mask. He took off my face.
This was given to me by somebody who looked just like me.
This is me! This is me's gun, not mine.
Gentlemen, don't go for your guns.
I'm a psychiatrist. I can help you.
We can discuss this. We're rational...
Doc! Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?
No, I'm all right. I'm just fine.
I'm at the Golden Gate Park.
Meet me in a half hour at the North by Northwest corner.
Yes. Good.
[Pigeons cooing]
[Whistling a tune]
[Panting]
[Murmuring disapproval]
[Gasping]
Richard, the world has gone crazy.
Nothing makes any sense anymore.
I don't know what to believe or not to believe.
My life is just all topsy-turvy.
One minute you're singing love songs.
The next minute you're pumping bullets into an innocent man.
Then it is not you.
It is the other Thorndyke.
How much more can a girl take?
My nerves are cracking.
I feel like I'm going to die.
I think I am going to explode!
THORNDYKE: Vicky! Take it easy, darling.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I'm just so close to my menstrual cycle that I could scream.
[Growls loudly]
Vicky, please. We've got to think.
The only way out is to prove I didn't commit that murder.
Well, how?
Would you look at today's paper?
Now that is you pulling the trigger.
That is nobody but you.
THORNDYKE: Who took this picture?
How did they get it?
Brophy. My buddy, Brophy.
Wait a minute!
I was coming down in the elevator at the time of the shooting.
Here is the elevator. Here is me.
THORNDYKE: See that dot?
VICTORIA: But that figure is so tiny.
It's unrecognizable.
Brophy has the negative.
You've got to contact Brophy.
Have him blow up this negative and prove that's me in the elevator.
No, he left this morning.
He's probably back at the Institute by now.
How can you get excited at a time like this?
Don't get me wrong.
It's not that I'm not titillated.
We've got to separate.
Gosh, you're fickle.
We can't stay together. We can't be seen.
Listen, go back to your hotel room.
Call Brophy. Get him to blow up that negative. I'll call you later.
[Buzzing]
BROPHY: Yeah. It's coming.
Holy Toledo, you're right!
There is a figure in the elevator.
I think it's the doc.
This has to be much, much bigger.
I have to keep enlarging it until we can clearly see the doc's face.
Call me in an hour.
[Slow dramatic instrumental music]
BROPHY: That's the doc.
DIESEL:
Good work. Very good work, Brophy.
Unfortunately, it will never be seen.
We've got to destroy the negative.
Give us the negative, Brophy.
You'll never get it. Never, do you hear me?
You'll never get this. I'd rather die first.
MONTAGUE: Norton?
Here.
You fool.
That negative has been on the front page of every newspaper in San Francisco.
They can enlarge it as well.
You're right. I never thought of that.
We've got to think.
I've got it! We have to buy every single newspaper in San Francisco.
We'll need about $10,000 worth of change.
The first thing I want you to do is get a truck. A big truck.
Then you go around to all the newspaper...
All the stands. You put the paper...
- Perhaps it's not a good idea.
- It sucks.
Norton, take our good friend
Mr. Brophy, here...
...to the North Wing.
You see, darling...
...it's not the negative that has to be destroyed, it's Dr. Richard Thorndyke.
I think we'd better call our friend in San Francisco with the tin teeth.
I get so hot when you're bad.
[Montague groans]
[Electronic beeping]
Excuse me.
[Telephone rings]
Diesel, here.
OPERATOR:
I have a collect call from San Francisco.
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Hello, it's me. What do you want?
Hello, Braces?
I have a little present for you.
You may kill Thorndyke.
Thank you. I really appreciate this.
I really do. Thank you.
[Breathing heavily]
Life is good.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Telephone rings]
[Gasps]
Hello?
[Heaving breathing on phone]
Listen, mister.
I don't go for this sort of thing.
[Gasping on phone]
I know a lot of the other girls are turned on...
...by these kinky phone calls, but I couldn't care less.
How did you get my room number?
[Groaning on phone]
I am not going to listen to any more of this. I've had just about enough...
[Groaning continues]
What are you wearing?
Jee...
Jeans? You're wearing jeans?
I bet they're tight.
Oh, my God.
[Breathing heavily]
[Groaning]
You are an animal.
Vicky.
Victoria. It's me, Richard.
Richard.
I knew it was you all the time.
I just went along with it.
[High-pitched laughter]
I laughed. Did you laugh?
Victoria, I just killed a man.
Another one? Listen, Richard, you've got to get a grip on yourself.
THORNDYKE: You don't understand.
I killed the man...
... who killed the man in the lobby.
Never mind. Did you reach Brophy?
I did and he said there was a figure in the elevator...
...and that it might be you and he was enlarging it until he was certain.
Then I waited for one hour and called back.
And?
VICTORIA:
And they said that he wasn't there.
Oh, my God, they know.
They know everything.
They've got Brophy.
They've got the picture.
What are we going to do?
How can we prove you're innocent?
We have to get back to the Institute and find your father.
We must expose Diesel and Montague for what they are.
VICTORIA: How'll we leave town?
The police are absolutely all over the place.
Go to the Salvation Army.
The Salvation Army?
Are they good at this sort of thing?
No! Go to the Salvation Army and get...
VICTORIA: Richard. Wait a minute.
THORNDYKE: What is it?
VICTORIA: I can't go through with this.
I'm sorry, I just... Look at this clothing.
What makes you think we're actually going to sneak by?
Victoria, if we do it just the way we rehearsed it, it will work.
Remember, we're not sneaking by.
We have to be loud and annoying.
If you're loud and annoying, psychologically, people don't notice you.
Come on. We can do it.
Loud and annoying.
VICTORIA: [In Russian accent]
I can't carry this no more.
[In Russian accent]
Celery? You had to buy in San Francisco?
You can't get it by the market near our house?
Excuse me,
I bought the celery in case on the plane...
...they wanted to serve you a Bloody Mary.
A Bloody Mary?
Well, I don't like the Bloody Mary they serve on the plane.
No, sir. It's too burning.
They don't even put tomato juice, they put snappy peppy.
Murray Weintraub, remember him?
Morning, noon and night he drank the Bloody Marys with the peppy snappy.
You know where he is now?
Dead from that.
Murray Weintraub is not dead.
Murray Weintraub is alive.
No!
VICTORIA:
Morris Turtletaub you're talking about.
The one from Great Neck who walks sideways like this.
[Muttering nonsensically]
No, sir. Morris Turtletaub didn't walk like that.
Morris Turtletaub, to my memory, walked just like this.
[Muttering nonsensically]
A little irregular.
THORNDYKE: Couldn't help himself.
Come on, let's get out of here.
VICTORIA: Slowly.
THORNDYKE: Don't push!
VICTORIA: Come on.
THORNDYKE: Don't push.
Sir, will you please put your bags up here?
- What?
- Please put you bags right up here.
- What do you need it for?
- We have to X-ray them, sir.
You have to X-ray?
Here. You want to X-ray the celery?
You think we're smuggling dope in here?
- Celery is not for dope it's for dip.
- Sir, others are waiting.
- All right, go ahead. You go.
- I can't. I'm scared.
For God's sake, go through already.
Wait a minute.
Is this one of those blowers that blows up the skirt, gives a free show?
THORNDYKE: Take a chance, go through.
Don't make trouble at the airport.
[Victoria whimpering]
VICTORIA: Okay, come on, Sam.
THORNDYKE: All right. Here I go, folks.
VICTORIA: Sam!
[Victoria makes high-pitched whining sound]
What?
[Victoria whines]
Well...
...here I go.
[Electronic beeping]
Is this a game show?
What did I win, a Pinto?
MAN: We have to search you.
Please, sir. What did I do?
- What's my crime?
- You beeped.
I beeped!
Take me away. Take me back to Russia.
Put me in irons.
I beeped! The mad beeper is loose.
Take away the beeper. Put me away.
POLICEMAN: It's all right. Please, just go.
Thank you.
- Richard, you were absolutely brilliant.
- You were wonderful yourself. Come on.
[Slow instrumental music]
Professor Lilloman?
Professor.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
VICTORIA: Oh, my God. He's dead!
Dead? Who's dead?
Somebody died? Where?
- Professor, we thought you were dead.
- I sleep that way.
It scares the hell out of everyone.
Professor, have you seen my father?
Your father? Who are you?
Forgive me. This is Victoria Brisbane.
Her father is Arthur Brisbane.
- This is the cocker's daughter?
- Yes.
How do you do? I'm sorry for you.
Professor, please, Brophy.
We are looking for Brophy.
It's important that we find him.
Brophy.
I'm sorry to have to tell you, but Brophy was taken to the North Wing.
What?
According to Montague, the poor chap had a mental breakdown.
- Mental breakdown?
- Yeah.
Brophy is not smart enough to have a mental breakdown.
The North Wing.
- Come on, we have to go.
- I go with you, perhaps I can help.
THORNDYKE: Come on, hurry.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
THORNDYKE:
Brophy, have you seen Brisbane?
Where is Brisbane?
I'm sorry.
- Where is he?
- They took him to...
[Shrieking]
Norton's taking him up to the tower.
Oh, my God!
BROPHY: He's drugged. They're going to throw him off, like a suicide.
VICTORIA: Dad.
THORNDYKE: Come on, let's go.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
LILLOMAN: There! Look!
VICTORIA: Daddy.
Richard.
- Do something.
- I'll try.
[Lightning crackles]
[Thorndyke sighs]
I can't.
What is it?
He suffers from High Anxiety.
It strikes one out of seven.
BROPHY: Don't worry, Miss. I'll stop him.
LILLOMAN: I go, too.
Oh, God. I feel like such a...
Coward?
Yeah.
[Panting]
I can't go on.
BROPHY: I got him!
I ain't got him.
LILLOMAN:
Where can we go? What can we do?
- I've got to save him.
- No.
He'll kill you. I'm going to go up.
[Eerie instrumental music]
[Gun thuds on stairs]
[Cracking]
[Screaming]
He's going to fall!
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Thorndyke gasps]
Hold on! Pull yourself up! You can do it!
I can't hang on!
That's it! Richard, listen to me!
I have researched your case.
I know what's giving you the High Anxiety.
I have found the answer.
Go back in your mind. Go back.
You are a little baby.
Your mother and father are fighting.
They're always fighting.
They're fighting about you.
[Baby babbling]
FATHER:
I hate this kid! He's making us prisoners!
We're trapped in this house!
We can never go out!
What do you want me to do?
Get rid of him? Is that what you want?
Shut him up!
Shut him up! I can't take it!
MOTHER: He's falling!
I understand now.
It's not height I'm afraid of. It's parents!
Ja.
Now climb, you son-of-a-bitch. Climb!
[Triumphant instrumental music]
LILLOMAN: Come on, Doc. You can do it.
LILLOMAN: He's almost at the top.
Hurry, Richard.
[Uplifting instrumental music]
Come on, Doc.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Norton.
THORNDYKE: Oh, my God.
- Mr. Brisbane, are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.
Get down the stairs.
Thank you. You saved my life.
Thank God it's over.
[Diesel screaming]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Shrieking and cackling]
[Montague gasps]
Fins. I give up.
I never really liked her. She never bathed.
But I like you, I'll be on your side.
I'll do anything you say.
I'm good at that. If I don't behave you can beat the living crap out of me.
I wouldn't mind.
[Montague screams]
BROPHY:
Are you all right? We saw a figure fall.
That was Nurse Diesel, she went out this window.
VICTORIA: Daddy, I love you.
BRISBANE: My baby.
BROPHY: My boss.
THORNDYKE: Brophy.
LILLOMAN: My Richard.
Professor.
- You saved my life.
- Ja.
You saved my life. Who are you?
Dad.
This is the man I'm going to marry.
THORNDYKE: Jeepers, Vicky.
VICTORIA: Isn't he a dreamboat?
[Whimsical instrumental music]
Goodbye, Dad.
[Victoria shrieks gleefully]
[Both sighing]
I absolutely love my new name.
Mrs. Victoria Harpo Thorndyke.
Mrs. Dr. Victoria Harpo Thorndyke.
Yes. Doctor?
I'm having this problem.
Problem? Well...
...maybe we should examine the situation.
DIRECTOR: Nice shot.
Pull the camera back slowly.
CAMERAMAN: We're going too fast, we're going to hit the wall.
CAMERAMAN: Now what do we do?
DIRECTOR: Never mind. Keep pulling back.
Maybe nobody will notice.

Oh, hello there, honey!
- Nice to see you!
- This is my son.
How do you do?
Dorothy, this here's Gil Warren.
- Hi.
- It's so good to see you.
Don't worry, Gil.
She's just shy.
I brought you some tea.
Look! Here they come.
Come on, they're coming!
Shh.
We're getting ready to set the table.
Take these checkers someplace else.
Here, you take these.
Come on, Henry, be careful.
Come on.
- Oh, man, you always drop the checkers when I'm...
- That's the way you win!
Toto! Toto! Toto baby!
# Put your arms around me, child #
# Like when you bumped your shin #
# Then you'll know
I love you now #
# As I loved you then #
# Though you may be trying sometimes #
# And I need you and you're not there #
# You know I may get mad #
# And turn away #
# But you know that I still care #
# Don't lose the feeling that we have #
# Don't lose the feeling that we have #
# Though you're growin' older now #
# And I'm watching you grow #
# I know I make you sad sometimes #
# And I see your feelings show #
# But one day I'll look around #
# Yeah #
# And you will be grown #
# You'll be out in the world such a pretty girl #
# But you'll be on your own #
# And I'd like to know it's there #
# The feelin' that we have #
# Knowing that you can come to me #
# Whenever you are sad #
# Child, I'd like to know it's there #
# The feeling that we have #
# Don't lose the feeling that we have #
# Don't lose the feeling ##
# Lose it #
# I don't even know the first thing #
# About what they're feelin' #
# What am I afraid of #
# Don't know what I'm made of #
# Can I go on #
# Not knowin' #
# Feelin', feelin' #
# Somethin' tells me that it's more than I #
# Can deal with #
# Though I never knew the song #
# Some words still catch on #
# Like carin' #
# And sharin' #
# Being together #
# No matter #
# Can I go on #
# Not knowin' #
# Don't know what I'm made of #
# Why am I afraid of #
# Feelin' #
# If I dared to take a chance #
# Would someone #
# Lead me ##
Emergency snow alert is now in effect.
No automobiles are to be driven without snow tires or chains.
Winds up to 45 miles per hour...
That was a great dinner, Emma.
- That baby!
- You're a grandpa!
- Our daughter's fine.
- Mmm.
But Dorothy.
Give her time, honey.
Give her time.
Those dishes ain't gonna wash themselves.
Mrs. Warren's son looks real fine, don't he?
Aunt Em, please, no more matchmaking.
Did you make the decision about that new school yet?
It's no decision to make.
But, honey, it's a chance to teach in high school.
Get away from that kindergarten once and for all. It's more money.
But besides the money, it's a chance for you to be with older students.
Almost adults.
- I like it with the kids, Aunt Em.
- I know you do, honey.
And you're a fine teacher.
But that's why I think you'd enjoy teachin' high school.
Have a chance to be with the students for four years...
...such an important time in their development.
I'm really happy with the kids, Aunt Em.
But you been there for three years already.
It's time you got out of that sandbox and into some new people, new neighborhood.
Girl, do you know you're
24 years old and you've...
Never been south of 125th Street?
Well, you haven't.
Oh, here we go again.
You get me so worked up...
...that I'm beginning to sound like a Jewish mother.
I can't see how goin' south of 125th
Street ever made anybody's life better.
And you're never gonna know unless you try, are you?
Come on, Aunt Em, let me do that.
Why don't you go in and relax?
I can do... Let me do that.
Listen, I know gettin' out in that world ain't easy...
...leaving Uncle Henry and me.
But we'll always be here for ya, Dorothy.
And whatever your fears are, well...
...they'll be defeated just by facing up to 'em.
Now, you take that new job and find a place for you and Toto.
It's time for you to make a home of your own.
Toto! Oh! Toto!
Toto! Toto!
Toto!
Toto! Oh! Toto!
Toto!
Toto! Toto!
# La, la, la, la, la #
# La, la, la, la #
Toto! Where are you?
Toto! Toto! Toto! Toto!
Oh!
Toto, Toto.
- Toto, Toto.
- To... To... Toto!
- Toto, Toto. Toto, Toto.
- To... To... To...
- Toto! -
Toto! - Toto!
God, where am I?
Toto! Toto!
Toto! Toto!
Two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two!
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?
No! No!
- Relax, Mama!
- We just wanna lay a little thanks on ya.
- What?
- You know, heavy on the gratitude department.
- Gratitude? For what?
- For curling the curse.
- For leveling the leech.
- For killing our oppressor.
Uh! I never killed nothin' in my life.
- Never killed the point?
- A pint?
- A good story?
- The umpire?
- No!
- Never killed no time?
No, I told you!
I never killed nothin'!
Well, then, I think you graduated...
...from the bush leagues into the majors, girl.
Toto?
Can you dig this?
- Who is it?
- Ain't no more "is"!
Thanks to you, it's a "was"!
- She was Evermean.
- The Wicked Witch from the East.
And they didn't call her Evermean for nothin'!
She was the parks department commissioner!
Caught us paintin' on her playground walls.
- Turned us into graffiti!
- And there we stayed.
- Flat, splat and stuck like that!
- Doomed as cartoons forever.
'Til you burned alphabet through the sky and ended the curse.
- And the "curseress. "
- Givin' a new lease on life to us...
The Munchkins, most recently referred to as the "cursees. "
Toto.
Let's hear it for
Super Witch and her Wonder Dog!
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?
Miss One!
Come to Mama, you hot little digits!
Let me lay my 20-20s on ya!
Oh, how I love you!
Let me... Mmm!
Count the ways!
Oh, mmm! Mmm!
Innumerable blessings, countless felicitations.
Thank you beyond number and additional good stuff!
I didn't mean to...
I didn't mean to kill her.
Oh, don't be all sixes and sevens, honey.
You did the world a multitudinous service by 86ing ol' Evermean.
Bottom line, honey, this chick put the "ugh" in ugly.
But she sure had pretty shoes, didn't she? Yah!
I don't want these shoes.
I wanna go home.
I wouldn't discount those shoes, honey.
And don't ever take 'em off until you do get home.
Remember Miss One told ya.
Oh, pardon me.
Miss One's the name if you haven't guessed by now.
Numbers is my game and now that you've freed us... we can all go back to runnin' our business, ahem.
We can all go back to runnin' our business.
But where am I?
Where am I?
You're in Munchkin Land!
- The indivisible Land of Oz!
- Oz?
But where's my home?
Where's Aunt Em? Where's New York?
- New York?
- 433 Prospect Place.
Ooh! Four, three, three.
You wanna play more than one number today, honey?
I got a freedom special, three numbers for the price...
No, I don't wanna play any numbers.
I just wanna get home!
Oh, well, now that ol'
Evermean's number's up...
...that leaves only three witches in Oz.
One, myself, but my powers don't amount to much.
And number two, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South.
Oh, she's a real star, but you can hardly catch her in.
And number three, the multi-horrored
Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West.
Evermean's even uglier sister!
But I don't think it'd be a good time to ask her for a favor.
So I figured the odds are only the Wiz could cipher how to get you back to...
- Where'd you say that place was?
- The Wiz?
What's a Wiz?
What's a... What's a Wiz?
Oh, darlin', he's the ultimate.
The "X" quotient, the new math.
The common denominator, the main man.
The head honcho!
Bottom line, honey.
Numero uno!
- Where is he? How do I find him?
- Catch this number, honey.

Count your blessings, cut your losses and follow the Yellow Brick Road.
- The Yellow Brick Road?
Yeah! The Yellow Brick Road!
Yellow Brick. Toto!
Remember, don't ever take those shoes off and watch out for the poison poppies!
Wait.
Miss One?
Miss One?
Miss One!

# I wish #
# I was home #
# I wish, I wish #
# I wish I was ##
Wait! Mister, please wait!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Succulent and divine!
- Delicious and nutritious.
- Brother crows, this is good stuff!
I'm glad you fellows are enjoying your breakfast.
Is today the day you're gonna help me get down from here?
Help you down?
What is goin' down in that hayloft you call a head?
Didn't we tell you yesterday and the day before that...
- And the day before that...
- That you can't get down?
This is your life, buddy, all hung up!
Besides, Clyde...
...us crows are just thinkin' of you.
There ain't nothin' to get down for!
But I was just thinkin', just once, fellas...
...for a little while to walk in my garden, wouldn't that be terrific?
- Walk!
- You can't walk!
Why, you just a straw paper dummy!
You're right, fellas.
I was just bein' selfish.
And stupid as usual!
- But I was readin' this morning that most people...
- Oh, man!
Look, didn't we tell you readin' was a waste of time?
- But Bacon here said...
- Bacon? Once over lightly, please!
"Knowledge is power. "
- See, and, uh, Cicero, he said...
- Cicero-ro-row!
"More men are ennobled by study than by nature. "
And over here, especially apropos in my situation...
...i. E., stuck up on this here pole:
"Do not accept any situation.
Question, argue and explore. "
Now who you gonna believe?
- Mr. Nobody on that paper?
- Fellas, please!
Or your good friends, the crows?
Yeah, who have dedicated their lives to educatin' you.
- Yeah!
- Sounds to me, fellas...
...like ol' garbage guts here done forgot the crow commandments again.
Fellas, I did not forget the crow commandments. Please!
Run 'em by me!
Run 'em by me.
- Thou shalt honor all crows.
- Right on!
- Proceed!
- Thou shalt stop readin' all bits of paper and literature.
- Trash! Trash!
- And the most important one!
Thou shalt never, never get down off of this here pole!
You got it, Clyde!
And the crow anthem!
I gotta sing that thing again?
# You gotta libretti it
'til you get it #
- # Elucidate #
- # Reiterate #
# And syncopate #
# You can't win
You can't break even #
# And you can't get outta the game #
# People keep sayin' #
# Things are gonna change but they look just like #
# They're stayin' the same #
# You get in way over your head #
# And you only got yourself to blame #
- # You can't win, child #
- # You can't win, child #
# You can't break even #
# You can't get outta the game #
# You can't win
The world keeps movin' #
# And you're standin' far behind #
# People keep sayin' #
- # Things'll get better #
- # Just to ease your state of mind #
# So you lean back #
# And you smoke that smoke #
# And you drink your glass of wine #
# Sayin' you can't win child #
# You can't break even #
# And you can't get outta the game #
# You can't win #
# You can't win no way if your story stays the same #
- # You ain't winnin' #
- # Oh, no #
# But I'd like to see you
I'm awfully glad you came #
# Better cool it
'cause it ain't about losin' #
# Then the world has got no shame #
# You can't win, child #
# Can't break even
Can't get outta the game #
# You can't win
You can't break even #
# Ain't the way it's supposed to be #
- # You'll be spendin' your little bit of money #
- # Oh, no #
# While someone else rides for free #
- # Learned your lesson #
- Ooh!
# Refuel your mind before some turkey blows out your flame #
- # And you can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #
- # You can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #
# You can't win, child
Can't break even #
# And you can't get outta the game #
# You can't get outta the game #
# You can't get out #
Ooh!
# Of the game #
# No, no, no ##
- I'll, I'll help you down.
- What?
You will?
What's she doing here?
- Get her outta here.
- Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
Shoo, shoo, go on about your business.
Shoo!
Ooh!
- Just hold on.
- This is just an experiment.
The results of the first experiment:
Subject is a hopeless failure.
- You are not.
- I am.
You're just a product of some negative thinking.
First thing we have to do is get rid of these crows.
Come on, Toto, sic 'em!
Shoo! Shoo!
Shoo! Before I call the taxidermist, you turkeys!
Get off me, dog!
Good boy, Toto.
We can go now.
You okay?
Come on! Hey!
Ooh!
I think I'm gonna make it this time.
You sure are.
Just a little self-confidence...
...and coordination.
You're gonna be fine.
You mean, all this time the only thing standing between...
...hangin' up there and livin' it up down here... were those crows?
Well, they told you you couldn't do it and you believed them.
If I only had a brain, I would have figured that out a long time ago.
There you go with that negative thinkin' again.
- Everybody has a brain.
- Uh-uh.
Not me, look.
Oh.
Garbage?
"Lgnorance is the night of the mind...
...a night without moon or star. "
Confucius said that.
I'm on my way to find the Wiz.
He's gonna get me back home.
That's nice. Thank you.
Good luck.
I thought maybe he could get you a brain.
You think that he could...
And Toto and me, we could sure use some company.
Besides, you have nothin' to lose.
I don't, do I?
That was so smart of you!
I wish I thought of that.
Indications are it would be very advantageous for me to join you.
Good.
Um, we only have one problem.
The Munchkins said to follow the Yellow Brick
Road, but I haven't been able to find it.
- Yellow Brick Road?
- There it is!
Hey, wait! Wait!
Did you say, "Yellow Brick Road"?
- Yes!
- Look over here!
We don't need no cabs.
- Say, what's your name?
- My name is... Dorothy.
Dorothy and Toto?
What intelligent names!
Okay, Dorothy and Toto, we're gonna have to find our own Yellow Brick Road.
# Ease on down
Ease on dow... #
- Down the road!
- There it is!
# Ease on down #
- Oh!
- # Ease on... Down #
- Down the road!
- Oh!
# Don't you carry nothin' #
- # That might be a load #
- There it is!
Dorothy! Look! Dorothy!
Aaah!
Ta-da!
Whoo! Come on, Dorothy!
Come on!
Whoo!
# Come on and ease on down ease on down the road #
# Come on, ease on down ease on down the road #
# Don't you carry nothin' that might be a load #
# Come on, ease on down ease on down the road #
# Pick your left foot up put your right one down #
# Come on, legs keep movin' #
# Don't you lose no ground #
# Just you keep on keepin' on the road you choose #
# Don't you give up on walkin'
'cause you gave up shoes #
# Ease on down
Ease on down the road #
# Come on, ease on down ease on down the road #

# Ease on down the road #
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
# Ease on down
Ease on down #
Toto!
# Ease on down ease, ease on down #
- # Down the road ##
- Help!
Help!
Help?
Help? Where?
Help! Help!
Over here!
Help!
Hurry! Hurry!
- Where are you?
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Step right up and save a life!
Ooh! Ooh!
I'm in a little bit of a squeeze, brother. Can you give me a hand?
Dorothy?
Oh, how terrible.
- Don't move.
- Don't worry, I wasn't planning any promenades.
We'll be right back.
Oh, he's so brave.
He's probably in shock.
Oh, what I wouldn't give to be in shock... Just once.
I'm so... I'm so sorry.
No apology necessary. I told you nothing hurts me. I have no feelings.
The genius who created me only took care of my dashing good looks...
...my razor sharp wit and my irresistible attraction to the wrong women.
What he forgot to add... was a heart.
But... Everyone has a heart.
Alas, everyone but yours truly.
Hello!
Nobody home in Soulville.
Rid of you!
Free from your posterior prison!
You hulking she devil!
Don't hear ya laughing now.
We were abandoned here when this park went "el foldo. "
Ah, it was a sad day.
There's not much amusement to the closing down of an amusement park.
But yours truly is an old trooper!
I quickly made plans for the future.
But alas, I was felled by my 4th wife, Teenie.
Crushed in my prime!
There, how does that feel?
But that's the whole tragic point, my friends.
# What would I do #
# If I could suddenly feel #
# And to know once again #
# That what I feel is real #
# I could cry
I could smile #
# I might lay back for a while #
- # Tell me what #
- # What #
# What would I do #
# If I could feel #
# What would I do #
# If I could reach inside of me #
# And to know how it feels to say #
# I like what I see #
# And I'd be more #
# Than glad to share #
# All that I have inside of here #
# And the songs my heart might bring #
# You'd be more than glad to sing #
# And if tears should fall from my eyes #
# Just think of all the wounds they could mend #
# And just think of all the time
I could spend #
# Just being vulnerable again #
- # Tell me what #
- # What #
# What would I do #
- # Oh, tell me what #
- # What, what would I do #
- # Oh, tell me what #

I'm just a miserable hunk of junk.
Me!
Once the fastest metal mouth on the midway.
Frozen... ironically in a position
I had assumed all too often.
A seat cushion for Teenie!
Teenie!
- Teenie!
- Dorothy!
- Teenie! Teenie!
- Are you thinkin' what I am?
- Teenie!
- You're so smart!
Teenie! Teen...
You could come with us to see the Wiz.
He's gonna get me back home...
...and he's gonna get the Scarecrow some brains.
Maybe he could get you a heart.
You're not just flimflammin' an ol' flimflammer, are ya?
Could I come with ya?
- Of course.
- "A threefold cord is not quickly broken. "
What's wrong?
He rusted himself cryin'.
Oil! Oil!
- What?
- Oil!
- Find some oil!
- Some oil!
Oil!
# Slide some oil to me #
# Let it trickle down my spine #
# If you don't have STP #
# Crisco will do just fine #
# Slide some to my elbow #
# And to my fingers if you would #
# Slide some oil to me, girl #
# Whoo, don't that feel good #
# Slide some oil to my feet #
# Look-a there

# Come on slide some oil to my knees #

# Slide some oil to me #
# Let it slip down my side.
# Laying there in one position #
# Sure done made me tired #
Now watch me dance.
Come on, you metal metatarsals, don't fail me now.
Ah-ha! Fall in line and get left behind.
Two bits!
Let me show you my
Saturday night finish!
Oh! Music man!
Let me hear that band!
# Don't turn the water on me #

Come on!
# There may be times you think you've lost your mind #

Hey! Look at me walkin'!
- Stop the music!
- What's the matter? You need more oil?
No! That beast!
He's checkin' us out.
Oh, it's just a statue.
Made of stone, see?
Now even a dummy like me knows a stone lion...
...can't... Check you out.
# Say what you wanna but I'm here to stay #
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #
# Now you can go where you're gonna #
# But don't get in my way

Ha-ha!

You tacky package of horse fodder.
Begone, you overexcited slot machine.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh! You mangy mutt! Oh!
Toto!
Oh!
He bit my paw!
King of the jungle?
- King of the cowards.
- You oughta be ashamed of yourself, scaring us like that.
You big scaredy-cat!
I can't scare anything.
I can't even scare a scarecrow...
...a tin man or a little puppy, anything.
It's no wonder they drummed me out of the jungle.
- I.O.B.K.!
- I.O.B.K.?
Incapable Of Being King!
No! Wait, wait! Wait!
I was exiled in disgrace.
I thought I'd be safe here.
No one would... discover my terrible secret.
Uh, that I'm...
...a lion without any courage!
"Uneasy lies the head...
...that wears a crown. "
W. Shakespeare.
Well, I thought
I'd seen 'em all.
But never, never have I seen...
...a lion... without courage.
Lion!
Lion!
Maybe the Wiz could give you some courage.
- It's a good idea.
- Capital suggestion.
- Capital! He's gonna get me a heart.
- And me some brains.
Come with us to Emerald City.
I'd love to, but I can't.
But why?
Because... I'm scared!
Oh.
# Oh, there #
# May be times #
# When you wish you wasn't born #
# And you wake one morning to find your courage gone #
# But just know that feelin' only lasts a little while #
# You just stick with us
We'll show you how to smile #
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
# Come on, ease on down ease on down the road #
# Don't you carry nothin' that might be a load #
# Come on, ease on down ease on down, down the road #
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
# Come on, ease on down ease on down the road #
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
# I gotta get down gotta get, gotta, gotta #
# Gotta, gotta, gotta getta, getta, getta #
# Ease on down the road ease on down the road ##
Ah, my ma would be so proud.
Going to see the Wiz!
My mama used to always say to me, Fleet!
Fleet?
That's my name,
Fleetwood Coup de Ville.
- Mama had high ideals.
- Yeah!
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah!
I ain't too happy underground, you all.
- How does he do that?
- It's just a hoax, my friend.
He's got a little motor in his... Pocket.
- Lion! Lion!
- Help!
- Oh, my... Please, somebody!
- Shh!
Lion! Lion!
Owww! Lion!
Li...
Lion!
Aaah!
Lion, save me!
Dorothy!
Toto! Toto, Toto, Toto.
Hey!
Oh! Wait!
- Where's the lion?
- I'm coming!
- Wait, wait!
- Lion!
Come on! Let's go!
- Hurry up!
- This way, this way! Wait for me!
Hey!
Sssss!
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
My queen, if you'll allow me, like I say...
...you stick with the big kitty and you'll be in heaven.
Sssss!
Outta the frying pan, into the...
This is like a setup.
Stay away! Dorothy! Lion!
Don't follow them! Don't!
Oh, please! It's a setup!
- Stop!
- Come back!
Jump! Don't go in there!
Whoo, whoo!
Oh! Dorothy! Lion!
- I can't move him! I can't move him!
- Dorothy?
- Get Toto, we'll come back for him.
- Toto!
Oh, look, poor little Toto!
Sweet little Toto.
What are we going to do?
- All is lost!
- Dorothy!
Dorothy, please.
Oh, please, don't be dead.
Oh, please, don't be dead.
Oh, all is lost.
# How high the moon #
What's happenin', babe?
Hey, Lion's okay!
- Hey, baby!
- Come and cry over here!
- Teenie! Think of Teenie!
- Dor... Dorothy?
- Think of Teenie!
- Uh, Teenie, uh, Teenie!
- Uh, Teenie!
- It's all my fault!
Uh, Teenie! Uh, Teenie!
Oh, mighty Zeus!
And gods of the universe!
Why have you cursed this low, mangy animal so?
Once I was a king, a lion amongst lions!
Ruler of a beautiful kingdom by a waterfall.
Attended by butterflies and sparrows.
And now banished for lack of courage...
I cannot even protect these friends who have been so kind.
Oh, I was strong and brave...
...in the subway only to be foolish and weak again.
I led us into the very jaws of death!
Oh, let me end it all!
- Lion, Lion!
- No!
No, let me splatter to the four winds!
It's all right, Lion.
It's all right.
Everything's all right.
- The worst is over, my furry friend.
- No!
Would you lay an appropriate quote on this poor beasty brother?
"Showers expected late tomorrow. "
Lion?
# There is a place #
# We'll go #
# Where there is mostly quiet #
# Flowers and butterflies #
# A rainbow lives beside it #
# And from a velvet sky #
# The summer storm #
# You can feel #
# The coolness in the air #
# But you're still #
# Warm #
# And then a mighty roar #
# Will start the sky #
# To cryin' #
# But not even lightning #
# Will be frightening #
# My lion #
# And with no fear inside #
# No need to run #
# No need to hide #
# You're standing strong #
# And tall #
# You're the bravest #
# Of them all #
# If on courage #
# You must call #
# Then just keep on tryin' #
# And tryin' #
# You're a lion #
# In your own way #
# Be a lion #
Come on, be a lion.
# I'm standing strong #
# And tall #
# You're the bravest #
# Of them all #
# If on courage #
# You must call #

- How do we get in?
- And how do you do?
- Good evening there, brother.
- This place is nice.
The service entrance is at the side.
We're here to see the Wiz.
This is where the Wiz lives, isn't it?
May I welcome you to the Emerald City.
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# I want to be seen green #
# Wouldn't be caught dead red #
# 'Cause if you are seen green #
# It means you've got mean bread #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# You've got to be seen in green to show that your stuff's laid #
- # If you're not seen green #
# You'd better be wearin' jade #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# You've got to be seen green #
# Don't tell him your cupboard's bare #
# That you gave up one week's feed #
# To pay for your colored hair #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
An announcement from the great and powerful Oz.
Oz.
I thought it over and green is dead.
'Til I change my mind, the color's red.
# I wouldn't be seen green #
# Ooo, ooo, ooo
Ah, ah #
# I wouldn't be caught dead #
# And if I'm caught at all #
# Then catch me in dead red #
# Ooo #
# You've got to be dead red #
# You've got to be real hot #
# So throw away those green gems #
# And wear rubies on your yacht #
# You've got to be dead red #
# You've got to have flash and flair #
# And if you're not seen red #
# Then you shouldn't be seen #
# Nowhere #
How quick fashion goes down the drain.
Last week when you all was wearin' pink...
...already for me, red was old.
The ultimate yellow brick is gold.
That's the new color, children, hit it.
# Golden gold #
# You've got to be seen gold #
# Watch out for the new kind you've got to have old gold #
# Like some from a gold mine
You've got to be wearin' gold #
# The 24 karat kind and once you've shined it up #
# It should ought to make you blind #
# You've got to be seen in gold to show you're super slick #
# It helps to pay tips and tolls
It's the ultimate yellow brick #
# It's the ultimate #
# Gold #
# Gold, gold #
# Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold ##
An announcement from the great and powerful Oz.
Send up the one with the silver slippers.
Do you know how lucky you are?
I've been trying to get an appointment for two years!
No one sees the Wiz!
- I knew you'd make it.
- Who does your hair?
Can you come for dinner next Wednesday?
- Can I give you my card?
- Can I take you home?
And...
Only the one with the silver slippers!
You go ahead, Dorothy.
"He who hesitates... "
Etcetera, etcetera.
Uh, I'd like to speak to the Wiz.
Hey, Mike!
Excuse me...
Excuse me, sir, Mr. Wiz?
Speak!
I'm not alone, sir. I'm here with my three companions and my dog, Toto.
Forget it.
No riffraff.
Uh, they're not riffraff, sir.
They're my friends and they've traveled far to see you.
I said, forget it!
Then, then, I'm not comin' up there.
What?
Either you see my friends, sir, or you forget it.
Send up the riffraff.
I don't think there's any choice.
Dorothy, you don't have to do it!
We could stay right here!
The Emerald City's not a bad place.
Get a small apartment, chip in together.
Hey, I bet in no time we'd fit right in.
But I could never be happy here.
Besides, I'd... Never get home.
I have to go all the way, even if it means to Evillene.
Come on, Toto, good boy.
Then I'm going with you.
Likewise!
Me too.
Come on.
Which road do we take?
Road? This one...
...and you may be sorry.
- Then how do we find Evillene?
- Don't worry.
She'll find you.
Owww!

Work! Work! Work! Work!
Work, work, work, work!
And...
...all lunch hours are cancelled!
Oh, please, O beautiful one!
We haven't had a lunch hour in six months!
Well, suffering is food for the soul.
Now suffer!
So, no one stopped Dorothy, eh?
All right!
Amateur night is over!
I'm summoning my flying monkeys!
No, no, not the flying monkeys!
Yes, yes, the flying monkeys!
I hate to have to do this myself, because I can't stand the smells...
...but these are red alert conditions!
Hot... Fire.
Peee-uu! Aaah!
- What's happenin'?
- Don't come any closer!
I got a little job for you, Cheetah.
Bring me Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Lion and the dog too.
How do you want 'em?
White bread or rye?
You get smart with me and I'll send you back to your cages!
Now get Dorothy and don't damage those silver slippers!
Peee-uu!
War is hell!
Hit it, Morris!
# Don't nobody bring me
Don't nobody bring me #
# Don't nobody bring me no bad news ##
# Ease on down #
I ain't scared.
Aaah!
- Hey, brother!
- Not now!
Lion! Wait for me!
Get back, I told you!
Psst! Psst! Psst!
Psst!
Psst, psst, psst!
We're over here!
- Psst! Lion!
- Psst!
Hey, brother!
You better get outta the way for me!
Toto! Where's Toto?
Toto! Oh!
Toto!
- Toto! Toto!
- Hey, there he is.
- Toto.
- I think we're safe.
So, you're Dorothy, huh?
You murdered my sister!
A saint she was.
And stole her shoes!
- Give them to me!
- No.
- What?
- No!
All right, you!
Don't worry, Dorothy.
It doesn't hurt.
It's just a little rough on my filing system.
Never fear, my little flower.
I'm just a hollow shell!
Don't give up the shoes!
Would you like sauerkraut or mustard, my dear?
On your hot dog!
Toto! Toto! No! Don't!
No, don't!
Don't you dare! Toto, Toto!
- Will you give me those shoes?
- Yes, yes, yes.
That's what I thought.
Toto.
Psst! Psst!
Hurry up with those shoes!
No! Don't touch that! No!
- No! No!
- Toto!
I'm allergic to water!
It makes me melt! No! No!
Please, please, help me with my friends!
Oh, no!
Here it is, I got 'em!
Oh, put him together.
I don't care what you do.
Just put him down.
Put him together.
Where's his arm?
His arm, oh!
Okay, okay, do something!
Get some tools, get something!
A crowbar, a hammer!
Don't hurt him!
# Everybody look around 'cause there's a reason to rejoice, you see #
# Everybody come out and let's commence to singing joyfully #
# Everybody look up and feel the hope we've been waiting for #

Whee!
Hello?
- Where are we?
- This must be the back door.
I don't think the killers of the Wicked Witch of the West...
...should be using the back door.
You know what I mean?
Cheetah says it's a shortcut.
- Good-bye, Cheetah.
- Good-bye, Dorothy.
Bye. Whew!
It's open.
Hello? Hello in there!
Wait!
- Wait a minute.
- Does this look familiar?
Guess who got had?
Barnum said there's a sucker born every minute.
I was there when he said it...
...but I never thought
I'd be one of 'em.
Phony!
You're nothing but a phony!
The Wizard's out!
He's not here!
Lies! No more lies.
You charlatan!
I've seen men shot for less.
- You're a terrible man!
- I'm sorry!
- Sorry?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Phony!
Everything they say about me is true.
I'm a phony!
I got no right to be pretending to be the Wiz!
I've got nothin'.
Hocus-pocus.
I'm just plain old Herman Smith from Atlantic City.
Atlantic City?
Atlantic City?
You mean, you're from New Jersey?
Mm-hmm.
I'm just a second-rate politician from District Seven.
"Public office is the last refuge of the incompetent. " Penrose!
Incompetent?
Ha-ha-ha!
That's me.
I'm incompetent.
So much so, I could never get elected to public office.
Not because I didn't try.
I tried everything.
Look, look!
I ran for everything.
Alderman, councilman, assembly leader!
I became a laughingstock.
I couldn't even get on the ticket!
Finally, in desperation,
I ran for dogcatcher!
I like animals.
Don't get me wrong.
I was at the end of my rope.
I plunged myself into the campaign.
One desperate grandstand play.
You know what I did?
I rented a hot-air balloon!
Hot air!
That's a perfect vehicle for you.
No, no, no!
It was a beautiful
Fourth of July day!
I planned to fly over the boardwalk and the beach...
...and throw my...
Aaah!
Throw my leaflets to the astonished crowds below.
My motto was...
"Vote for Smith, your best bet to catch that pet. "
But just when I got up in the balloon...
A terrible storm came up...
...and blew me into the clouds.
I got lost.
I landed here in Oz.
They'd never seen a hot-air balloon like mine before.
And I know I should have told them the truth...
...but they proclaimed me the Wizard...
...and I needed the job.
And you mean...
...you sent us to kill Evillene...
...knowing... we might never come back?
She would've killed me.
She would've found out
I had no power, and took over Oz.
That's no excuse.
Come on.
Please, please don't go.
I live...
I live here all alone...
...in terror...
...that someone will find out...
...that I'm a fraud.
Please...
...just stay with me for a little while and talk.
You can talk to me crazy...
...call me names.
What's the matter?
Now I'll never get my brain.
Nor my heart.
Or my courage.
But you don't need them now...
...because you've had them all along.
Scarecrow. Scarecrow?
You're the one who figured out how to find the Yellow Brick Road...
...and how to destroy Evillene...
...and every smart move we've made.
Didn't you?
And, Lion...
...you wouldn't even give up when
Evillene strung you up by your tail.
And, Tin Man...
...you have more heart than anyone I've ever known.
Honest?
Yes.
You never needed anything from the fake Wizard anyway.

What about you, Dorothy?
You'll never get home.
Me?
I guess you're stuck with Toto and me.
It's Glinda, the Good Witch of the South!
She has great powers.
Hello, Dorothy.
Please, is there a way for me to get home?
Dorothy, you were wise and good enough...
...to help your friends find what was inside them all the time.
That's true for you, also.
Home?
Inside me?
I don't understand.
Home is a place we all must find, child.
It's not just a place where you eat or sleep.
Home is knowing.
Knowing your mind, knowing your heart...
...knowing your courage.
If we know ourselves, we're always home, anywhere.
# If you believe #

You mean,
I could have gone home...
...by clicking my heels three times?
Uh-huh.
Dorothy.
Can you do something for me?
They've had what they've been searching for in them all along.
I don't know what's in you.
You'll have to find that out for yourself.
But I do know one thing.
You'll never find it in the safety of this room.
I tried that all my life.
It doesn't work.
There's a whole world out there.
And you'll have to begin...
...by letting people see who you really are.
Success...
...fame and fortune...
...they're all illusions.
All there is that is real...
...is the friendship...
...that two can share.
That's beautiful.
Who said that?
I did.
Oh, Dorothy.
I'll think of you all the time.
And I will miss you...
...every day.
Even if I had to go back to that junk pile...
...even as Teenie's seat cushion,
I wouldn't mind...
...because I have known real love.
Oh, don't rust yourself, now.
Oh, Dorothy.
If it hadn't been for you...
I'd still be back on that pedestal...
...afraid to live.
Me, too.
Thank you.
Thank you for being my friends.
I'm ready now.
Think of home.
Home.
# When I think of home #
# I think of a place #
# Where there's love overflowin' #
# I wish I was home #
# I wish I was back there #
# With the things
I've been knowin' #
# Wind that makes the tall trees #
# Bend into leaning #
# Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning #
# Sprinkling the scene #
# Makes it all clean #
# Maybe there's a chance for me to go back #
# Now that I have some direction #
# It would sure be nice to be back home #
# Where there's love and affection #
# And just maybe I can convince time to slow up #
# Givin' me enough time in my life to grow up #
# Time, be my friend #
# Let me start again #
# Suddenly my world's gone and changed its face #
# But I still know where I'm goin' #
# I have had my mind spun around in space #
# And yet I've watched it growin' #
# And if you're listenin', God #
# Please don't make it hard #
# To know if we should believe the things that we see #
# Tell us should we run away #
# Should we try and stay #
# Or would it be better just to let things be #
# Livin' here in this brand-new world #
# Might be a fantasy #
# But it taught me to love #
# So it's real real to me #
# And I've learned #
# That we must look inside our hearts #
# To find #
# A world full of love #
# Like yours, like mine #
# Like home ##

You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try
Try and try
You'll succeed at last
Persecution you must bear
Win or lose you've got to get your share
Got your mind set on a dream
You can get it if you want to perceive now
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
What's that?
It stopped?

You carry a lovely mango from country.
You have any more?
- Taking this for my mother.
- Put it up.
You'll succeed at last
I know it
Rome was not built in a day
Opposition will come your way
But the harder the bat received
Makes the seer a victory now
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try
Try and try, try and try
You'll succeed at last
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
Hey, country boy, move!
Wait a minute, man.
You know the way to Milk Lane?
You have money?
If you have money, go anywhere at all.
But if you don't have money, you're fucked. Better you stay at home.
- All right, how much?
- Give me 50 cents and help me push.
Hey, it's a red light.
That means stop.
That's why country boys, they get killed.
Did you hear that
Express yourself
Hey, Winston!
You know that bitch owes me money.
Hey, give me back my money!
Go after him. Go after him.
Hey, the guy over there sent me for his money.
He say you have the money, man.
Where's the guy now?
Bye, bye, bye
Good gracious
Stop that train
I want to get off
Hey, come back here, man!
Give me my things, man!
Come back here, man!
Stop that train

You know if this lady live around here?
Oh, over there.

Let me draw!
Ivan.
All right, come inside.
- You sick, Momma?
- Yes.
I wonder your grandmother when you leave. What you come to town for?
Grandma dead.
Dead? How she can be and I never knew?
We tried to get you, but the telegram came back.
- And when she going to bury?
- She buried already, Momma.
Bury already? Buried already, and I never got to go to the funeral?
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Don't cry. Don't cry.
Don't you cry.
Oh, God.
And what happened to the place?
Grandma sold the place before she died.
And what happened to the money?
She said she wanted a big funeral.
And she took all the money for her big funeral, and I didn't even get to go?
Then the money finished?
A little bit left.
Well, don't you have it?
Yes, I do.
- It's all that is left?
- Yes.
Then how are you gonna get back to country tonight?
I'm not going back.
Then where are you going? You can't stay here, because I can't help you.
- I'm staying in town.
- You think town is easy? How you gonna live?
I could make a record.
I can sing, you know, Momma.
You take this thing for a joke?
Well, I can get a job, then.
What kind of job you can get, other than a criminal?
Why you say a thing like that?
Why you say a thing like that about me?
Don't ask me any questions.
Go back to country.
All right.
Since you're determined,
I will give you the name of a person who will try and help you.
If you behave yourself, he may try and get a local job for you.
See it here?
- Preacher?
- Yes.
Him can help you.
Okay, Momma.
And you didn't even bring me a mango from country?
Mango season was bad this year.
I've got three on this.
- Where's... Which four is that?
- Yeah.
One blank, down there so.
Did you find Daisy?
Yeah.
You just come from the country?
Yes.
- You pass?
- Yeah, your play.
Five.
Your old lady?
So you sell your land in country and come back to town?
Can call it that.
So you mean.
So you mean.
Your play, man! Don't laugh, boy.
I don't wanna play another game until you pay me that 50 cents. You owe me too much now.
I can't pay you till tomorrow, you know.
Too much action around town for me to play with people who cannot pay.
What's showing at Rialto?
What do you know about Rialto, just come from country?
I read about it, man.
- So you want to go to Rialto?
- Yes.

I ask you, you know?
I ask you to try beginner's luck.
Get your hits from Hilton's.

and every sound around from beat to Bach and back.
Hilton's has everything in music.
Hilton!
Mr. Hilton!
Mr. Hilton!
Mr. Hilton. Mr. Hilton.
Mr. Hilton.
From morning, we've been here waiting for you. From 11:00, we've been here.
- What about?
- Mr. Kenton sent me.

- I have a tune, yes.
Sing it for me, then.
We are all one big brother
All belong to one father
You tread on one you hurt another
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We were fresh and perfect, see
Made to live in unity
Let peace be your motto...
Uh, that's all right, all right.
I can't use it. Too slow.
- Where you used to work?
- Morrison.
- What kind of work you do?
- Carpenter work.
All right, go and see Mr. Jackson.
Next. What can you do?
- I can do anything you want, sir.
- Can you pour concrete?
- You can do carpentry work?
- I never did it before...
- You can be a mason? You can paint?
- I can do it, you know?
- Just give me a break.
- What do you mean? "Give me a break. "
- We want skilled people.
- Just give me a break.
Give you a break?
Leave the place, man.

Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find
- My way over
- How do you do?
- What are you doing there?
- I'm looking for work.
I don't have any work to give you.
I could wash your car, you know, ma'am.
My husband gets the car washed downtown.
I could do your gardening.
Look, we have a gardening service to do that.
I can do anything, you know, ma'am. Anything.
Look, there's nothing you can do for me. Nothing you can do for me.
Beg you for ten cents then, ma'am.
What's the matter with you young, healthy boys?
All you know to do is beg, beg, beg.
That's all you can do, just beg?
- How you got in here, anyway?
- The gate was open, ma'am.
Well, when you go outside, you make sure you lock the gate behind you.
Who left the gate open?
Wandering, I am lost
As I travel along
The White Cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked washed up for years
And I merely survived
Because of my pride
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left and she didn't say why
And I guess I'll have to cry
- Many rivers to cross
- Rivers to cross
But just where to begin
I play for time
- There'll be times
- Many
- I find myself
- Rivers to cross
Thinking of...
You got ten cents, master? I was watching your car while you was away.
- No, man. The steward always look after my car, man.
- He's not here all the time.
If you want the ten cents, go beg the steward.
All right.
What you doing here?
Get out, man. Get out.
Get out, man!
Get outta here.
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking
- Close to Thee
- Close to Thee
Let it be, Dear Lord
Let it be
Just a closer walk with Thee
Closer walk with Thee
Love me, Jesus
- Is my plea
- Is my plea
Daily walking
- Close to Thee
- Close to Thee
Let it be, Dear Lord
Let it be
- Morning, Longa.
- Morning, Preacher.
- Morning, young man.
- Morning, Preacher.
- How're you gettin' along?
- Not too bad, sir.
I'll be back in a while.
Hey, pretty boy.
Pretty hat.
Johnny Too Bad.
Bring me the hammer.
What, you can't get it yourself?
No, man.
You bring it for me.
You have on pretty hat this morning.
You like it?
You really look like Johnny Too Bad.
You only need a gun to look like Johnny.
But before you get a gun, get the broom and come sweep out the shop.
I look like a preacher right now?
Get the broom and sweep out the shop.
You are a little boy.
Hi. What happening?
Can't see you.
You don't want to see me. What happened to you at choir practice last night?
What happened?
Did you miss me?
Personally, no.
But crusades start next week, and Preacher's asking for you.
Why are you calling him Preacher?
Don't he's your father?
- No.
- Oh.
Why you say it like that?
Nothing.
He's my guardian, ever since my father and mother died.
That's why he's so strict with you.
It's for my own good.
Excuse me.
- Who this bicycle frame belong to?
- Preacher.
- You think he'd want it?
- Don't have no use.
I can fix it up.
Maybe you and I could go for a ride.
I don't think so, you know?
Just a ride.
- Perhaps. Depends.
- Depends on what?
If you're a true Christian.
The rest of boys too rude.
Some Christians rude too.
I don't know about that.
El numero uno has arrived!
I know you're playing in Preacher's garden.
You know, Preacher tend that little cherry tree for a long time now.
When fruit ripe, if Preacher don't pick it,
I feel I will pick it.
Look like it's ripe too.
"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.
"They toil not, neither do they spin.
"And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory...
"was unarrayed like one of these.
"Wherefore, if God so clothed the grass of the field,
"which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven,
"shall He not much more clothe you,
O ye of little faith?"
Brothers and sisters, before you leave,
I'd like to inform you that you won't be able...
to pick up your records for the rally today.
The master record has not arrived from America.
I'll let you know about that during the course of the week.
Now let us stand and sing and praise.
Be guided poor lost sinner
Before the Lord inform
And in the name of Jesus
A pardon He'll perform
He heard Thy supplication
And soon the weak were strong
For Jesus took my burden
And left me with a song
Yes, Jesus took my burden
I could not help Him bear
Yes, Jesus took my burden
He answered to my prayer
He answers prayers I'm certain
My spirit was made strong
For Jesus took my burden
And left me with a song
Who turned off...
I did. You're gonna make the Lord come back and find you doing this?
- Doing what, Preacher? - Boogie-woogie and twistin' up yourself in my yard.
They don't have boogie-woogie anymore, Preacher.
I don't care what you want to call it!
I don't want it in my yard.
All right, Preacher.
I'm finished for the night, sir.
And furthermore, what are you doing here at this time of night?
- I was fixing the bicycle.
- Fixing your bicycle?
You should be reading your Bible.
Reading your Bible!
You hear what I tell you?
Reading your Bible three times a day!
- All right.
- Don't walk away from me. You're impertinent!
- You're rude! Don't have respect!
- Preacher on the warpath tonight.
- I wonder why.
- Must've noticed what we noticed.
What has Preacher got to do with that?
Preacher is a man of the Lord, but still...
He is a man, all the same.
And the Lord say,
"Go ye forth and multiply," and Preacher don't multiply yet.
Preacher has been my guardian, and he will always be my guardian, and that's that.
- When nothing else could help...
- Yes!
- Then love came down!
- Amen!
It rescued the perishing!
Cared for the dying!
Snatched us from iniquity!
Raise us from the grave!
Tonight, here is love!
Praise God!
- We say it is a gift of God!
- Amen!
Amen! Tonight, the wages of sin is coming!
It's death!
It's damnation!
It's derogation!
But here is the love of God!
- Here!
- Love worketh no end!
Love thinketh no evil!
Love never fails to accept, not even if provoked!
Praise God!
Let us give thanks to Jesus!
- Thank you, Jesus!
- Let's alleluia!
- Alleluia! Alleluia!
- Let's praise Him!
- Longa?
- Yes, Preacher?
- Where is that boy?
- I don't know, Preacher. He might be in his automobile.
His automobile, huh?
And where have you been?
I just been for a ride, sir.
You've been skylarking, and I can't find you?
All I can find is this nastiness in the place.
And you get into the house.
Do you know how long we've been waiting for this?
If we don't get to the studio, we won't have any records for the rally.
- I can take it right now.
- By the time you get there, it will be closed.
I can take it down right now, sir.
And be sure you come back in a hurry.
Auntie in her room cry
My mama said she must wipe her eye
Mama's such a lovely fool in life
She never been to school in all her days
No wonder he's a perfect partner
While they were dancing in that ballroom last night
Just a little rumor, friends
My uncle say he must work her in
And he's such a lovely a fool in life
It's not time for his wedding day
It's no wonder he's a perfect partner
While they were dancing in that ballroom last night
One more day for the wedding cake
And 20 bottles of cola wine
All the people them dress up in the white
Because he don't stop at anything
No wonder he's a perfect partner
- While they were dancing in that ballroom last night

Stop! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!
Put him on a separate track.
- And what do you want?
- Bring the records for the rally, sir.
I can sing too, sir.
I'd like the chance to make a record.
Everybody want to make a record.
You almost ready there?
But I have a boss song.
This one must sell.
- What time is the audition?
- Tomorrow.
- Okay, let's go.
- What time tomorrow?
- Tomorrow. We're ready.

Elsa?
- Who that?
- Ivan.
Come in.
- Fantastic news! Fantastic news!
- What happened?
- You remember the man Hilton I was trying to see?
- Yeah.
Saw him today.
He said I can record tomorrow.
- Great!
- Well, I want you to help me out.
- Yes.
- Will you lend me the key to go in the church?
You must be mad.
You want Preacher kill me?
Him don't have to know.
Can turn that amplifier down.
- No, Ivan.
- Why not?
- I just can't do it.
- If it wasn't for Preacher, I know you'd do it.
That sort of music can't play in church, Ivan.
If Preacher catch me, my life finished.
Life finished with him, but started with me.
What do you mean?
When this song hits, you know what it mean for me and you?
This is my big chance.
This is what we waiting for ever since I come to town.
Nothing can stop me now, you know?
I don't have to worry no more.
We'll have this song hit for you and me.
He won't let it, Ivan.
You're not gonna live in Preacher's house all your life.
You're not gonna live with him as man and wife.
You're a big girl now.
You're not a child anymore.
You have to make up your mind... between me and Preacher.
Where's the song?
I have the words in my back pocket.
Art outside.
Him listen to reason already.
I'm trusting you, Ivan.
All right.
One, two... one, two, three, four.
Tell me about pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
Yes.
And as sure as the sun will shine up...
What are you doing in my church at this time of night?
And playing all this kind of music in my church!
I will call the police to have you arrested for breaking into my church!
- We had a key, you know, Preacher.
- A key?
- You gave him the key to my church?
- Yes.
- Why?
- I had to give it to him.
- What else did you give to him?
- Nothing.
- I gave him nothing!
- You're lying!
No!
- You've been fornicating with him!
- No!
- You gave him your lips. You gave him your body.
- No, no!
- Look at you!
- No! No!
Hi. I hear you resigned your post, man.
What are you doing here?
- I come for my bicycle.
- Which bicycle?
That same one.
This bicycle is yours?
Since when?
Where you buy it from?
I didn't have to buy it. I see it throwed in back. Nobody claim it.
- This is Preacher's bicycle. Preacher's premises.
- Well, I fixed it up.
Who told you to fix it? I'm grateful, because Preacher give it to me.
It took me three weeks to fix the bicycle, Longa.
I paid $6 for the wheels alone.
That is your bad luck.
Don't joke with your life, Longa.
Give me my bicycle.
If it is your bicycle, take it, man.
Him cut me!
You want dead?
I will kill you.
Don't... fuck... with... me.
You've had every chance to make good.
You've been taken into the church...
and given a chance to lead a good Christian life.
And instead of that, you've gone and filled your head...
with foolishness and violence.
Since this is your first offense,
I'm not going to send you to jail.
I'm going to give you a chance to come to your senses.
Either it will bring you down to earth once and for all,
or there's little hope for you.
Eight strokes of the tamarind switch.
Well, you tell me about pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're born and when you die
Never seem to hear even your cry
So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share, what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they'll fall
One and all
The harder they come
The harder they'll fall
One and all
Well, the oppressors are trying to keep me down
Making me feel like a clown
And they think that they have got me on the run
I say "Forgive them, Lord they know not what they've done"
'Cause as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they'll fall
One and all
Harder they come the harder they'll fall
One and all
Oh, yeah
And they think that they have got me on the run
Tell them that they don't
It ain't no fun
And I'd rather die than live and be a slave
Yes, I'd rather be right in my grave
So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share right now
What's mine
And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall
One and all
Ooh, the harder they come the harder they'll fall
One and all
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Harder they come
The harder they'll fall
One and all
What I say one time
Sometime, sometime I feel
The harder, mmm
One more time
One more time, yeah
One more time now, uh
All right, that's enough.
That song all right.
I think we can use it.
- When it going to be released, huh?
- Read this first.
What's the meaning of this?
That means you get
$20 for the record.
Twenty dollars, sir?
That don't sound right.
- How much do you think it's worth, then?
- I don't really know, sir.
Come on, you must have an idea.
What do you think it's worth?
Well, I think at least about $200, you know, sir.
I don't think I'm signing this for $20, you know, sir.
I see. Looks like you have a new producer.
I wish you luck.
- Numero Uno!
- Hi, brother. How are you doing?
Not bad, you know. I have this record
I'd like you to play for me.
Let me have a look.
Hey, you're on a Hilton's label.
No, well, I used his studio.
I like the sound.
I see. But, well,
I deal directly Hilton's, man.
But this is my personal record, you know.
This is personal.
I'm an independent producer as well.
Well, like I said,
I deal with Hilton's direct.
You know, this is show business, baby.
No business, no show.
The oppressors are trying to keep me down
Making me feel like a clown
- No, man, you're joking.
What I gonna do with this?
After Hilton cut me off, you gonna supply me?
Hilton don't want this thing.
Take it back, son.
Every day you say you're gonna sell the record, but you can't without Hilton.
We've waited long enough, man.
I want the money now.
I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine
And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall
One and all
- Mr. Hilton.
- What do you want now?
- To make another record?
- Not exactly, no, sir.
- What do you want, then?
- I want the money.
Which money? Which money?
Talk quick. Which money?
You'll take the $20?
Yes, I'll settle for that.
You're damn right you'll settle for that.
I don't even particularly want to do business with you anyway.
- What do you say your name is?
- Ivanhoe Martin.
Ivanhoe what?
Martin.
Here. Sign here.
And remember... next time you cut a record, you see, sport, that I control this business.
Understand? Okay?
And remember something else.
I make hits, not the public.
I tell the DJs what to play.
Understand?
What do all of you want?
Ivanhoe no pay any of you yet?
But Ivan's supposed to pay you now.
I not supposed to give you money.
Anyhow, come.
And let this be a lesson to you, see?
Learn something from this next time.
Remember that fellow that wouldn't sign the contract? You can release it.
- Him sign now?
- Yep, but don't push it.
Tell the DJs I just want to make back my money, okay?
- But, sir, it's a good record, you know.
- I know, I know.
But he's a troublemaker.
I don't want anything to do with him.
I don't want to build him up, okay?
- What happened, son?
- Trouble, sir.
- What kind of trouble?
- Them shot Pedro's wife Nicole this evening.
- Who shot her?
- Army, sir.
- She had grass on her.
- Pedro got away with that.
- All right, leave it to me.
- What I must tell the trader?
They will just have to hold off for a couple of days, Jose.
- But the traders pay protection...
- Leave it to me.
Traders pay protection money, and one of them got shot.
Tell them not to get frightened. Just cool it for a couple of days and leave it to me.
- What about Pedro's wife?
- You organize that.
Find somebody to take her place, all right? Check with me later.
I have to go now, but you check me at the police station.
All right.
Hello. Get me the commissioner of police. Detective Ray Jones calling.
Hello, Commissioner.
Yes, sir.
The army went in today and shot one of my people's women.
- They're doing a series of raids.
- I know, but nobody told me!
- Who did they kill?
- An informer in the ganja trade.
They can't be concerned with who is an informer.
Well, I am concerned.
How can I control crime in my area... if the people giving me information can't operate freely?
Look, I know you use the trade as a form of control, but I can't explain that officially.
All I can do is ask the army to cooperate.
Would you please explain that if anybody controls what comes into town, it's me?
Rupert, your mother dead.
She can't help you.
Come. Come, let's go home.
Hi, baby.
Get any work today?
Big night tonight, you know.
Look what I buy you.
Ivan, you mean you take your money and you buy that?
It's a mini. Sexy.
Where's the food I asked you to buy?
You have any money left?
Don't worry about money, man.
After my record...
You sold out the record to Hilton for $20.
You don't have any more to get.
Just wait until the other producers hear my record tonight.
We'll drive away from this place tomorrow.
- Give me $2 for tonight.
- Where I must get it from?
You have it in your bosom, man.
- I only have $2 left.
- That will do.
I need it to buy food, and I'm going to church tomorrow.
Come with me.
You don't even have to dance.
No. I'm tired.
I've been walking and looking for work all day.
I'm not like you.
Want me to go and beg work when
I have a record? I'm done with that.
I not done with it, though.
I was walking all day.
What are you walking for?
You don't believe I gonna make it.
You think I'm just joking?
All I'm telling you is that I'm tired.
You want me to go and beg work for $ 10 a week for the rest of my life?
I tried that.
I'd rather die.
And I don't have to, because I'm gonna make it.
Ivan, you're a dreamer.
Me? Dreamer?
Who's a bigger dreamer than you?
Always talking about milk and honey in the sky.
Well, no milk and honey in the sky... not for you, not for me.
It's right down here, and I want mine now, tonight!
Can I just get out of this place here?
Sit tight and listen keenly... while I play for you a brand-new musical biscuit from the Hilton's empire.
This is a brand-new song they call "The
Harder They Fall" by the man called Ivan.
Well, you tell me about pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're born and when you die
Never seem to hear even your cry
- So as sure as the sun
- What do you think of this song?
- Will shine
- Not bad.
I'm gonna get my share, what's mine
- I think it's a hit.
- And then the harder they come
- I said all right.
The harder they'll fall
One and all
The harder they come the harder they'll fall
One and all
Well, the oppressors are trying to keep me down
Making me feel like a clown
And they think that they have got me on the run
I say "Forgive them, Lord they know not what they've done"
'Cause as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine
And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall
One and all
Harder they come the harder they'll fall
One and all
Sometime, sometime I feel
The harder, mmm
One more time, one more time

- You ask too much questions. Just enjoy the ride.
Wave.
Got your mind set on a dream
- Honey, you feed the chickens for me this morning?
- Yes.

Don't go too near the fire draft.
You might get sick again.

You ask too much question, man.
We get you.
- Well, so far.

The most you have to do is give Jose $ 15 a week.
Everything all right, right?
Hey, what happening, Pedro?
- Can I drag? All right.
- Mmm.
What happening, Pedro?
Love.
Give me a light.
New to this, man?
In a form.

You can tell by the way you look
Your face, your hands, your hair.
Everywhere as beautiful as can be.
You can tell
It's Chantel
Chantel olive oil pomade... the one that's rich with lanolin and pure olive oil...
to make your hair soft, smooth and easy to manage.
- Serve them right.
- Who?
They say they hold a plane in Florida loaded with ganja.
They say it come from here too.
Let's see.
One good thing. They say the U.S. Government will aid the army to clamp down on them.
Where's Pedro?
- I don't know.
- All right. I'll soon come.
Jose, you read the newspaper?
Mm-hmm. Your play.
Them catch a plane.
Two get through.
Somebody makin' plenty money.
Not us.
I only gettin' spit.
Who makin' all the money?
Ask no questions, tell no lies.
Serious.
We could sell some direct, you and I.
Your play.
They sellin' the thing for export.
At least we should get a little extra.
I is the one takin' the risk.
You know that.
What, you wanna split?
No, I don't wanna split.
I just want more money.
You're lucky you're makin' a living.
When I know you, down by your ass.
Now you have a Honda parked outside.
I don't like what's going on.
Listen. Better finish that game, now. Come, Pinky.
That is all we're getting this week? After we pay Jose, we don't have anything left.
What do you want? I don't even pay the doctor on Wednesday.
Don't pay Jose this week. Let him take our share from the money they make in America.
But I have to go explain the position to Jose.
And it's they caused the army to burn the field down.
Come here, sir.
Love, man.
Jose, can't pay all this week.
My baby's sick, you know.
No, that's not my concern.
Just $ 15 I need.
- My wife. She get me this week.
- I need just $ 15.
I don't want no soft words.
Just $ 15.
- Just money I give you.
- Money. That's right.
Love, man.
I pay you $5 this week, Jose.
- Keep that till you come out.
- Come out from where?
Pedro, tell him, huh?
I'm not afraid of you, you know, Jose.
You think it's me you must be afraid of?
Hello, Mr. Ray. Yes, sir.
The guy I get to help Pedro.
Him giving me a lot of trouble.
We have to lock him up for a while and teach him a lesson.
Tell me something.
Haven't I seen you with Jose somewhere before?
Which Jose that?
The same one that send the police after me, and I shoot him off the bike.
You're a bad man.
- Yeah.
- I see what you mean.
Hey. Hold up a little, man.
Hey, ease up, man.
Stay there.
What happened, eh?
What happened?
All right! See you later.
Wait. What happened, sir?
Oh, you have gun.
And you have on no pants.
You're stupid, huh?
You can get 0-5, 0-6.
- I want every possible car in the area.
- All right.
Lend me a pen and a paper.
Hey, look what a fella just brought in.
"I have made a record of crime history"? Do you think the guy's serious?
He's serious enough to kill three of my men.
You're jokin'.
Three men?
Well, I know because the man was in my office three minutes ago.
Yeah.
What you doing down there so long? You thinking?
You mean you can't think of a story to fool me with tonight?
You go on, make up your story, man.
What a day when I catch you out, and no story can help you.
That is the day I'm waiting for.
Hurry, give me a gun, sir.
I must find him in my area.
- Elsa?
- Ivan, what happened?
- You hear anything on the radio?
- The policeman outside said they're looking for you.
- Where's the radio?
- What happened? He say you shoot a policeman.
- You think it's one I drop?
I killed three.
- God forgive you.
- There's nothing on the radio except music.
You'll see a news flash about me later.
Where are you going now?
Where are you going to hide?
Hide? I not hidin'.
But everybody will be looking for you.
You didn't believe me?
Didn't I tell you I was going to be famous one day?
- You're mad.
- Tell Pedro to meet me tonight.
He will know where.
Tell him to bring money and some more bullets.
Tell him I want to find Jose.
What you want to see Jose for?
Read about that tomorrow.
Oh, it's you.
- Where's Jose?
- What you want him for?
I have something for him.
Give it to me.
I will give it to him.
So you want to give it to him?
I have somethin' for you too, you know.
Me God. Look what me get myself into now.
I'll tell you who's crying to me in bed, double-crossing me.
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ! Mercy!
No! No! No!
Don't shoot!
Killed a motorcycle policeman three days ago.
Last night, after escaping police,
the wanted man held up a pedestrian and took away his clothes.
Early this morning, he went to the house ofJose Smith,
whom he suspected of informing on him.
Not finding Smith, he shot and wounded a woman whom he found in Smith's room.
Police sources have identified her as the same woman who was with the fugitive...
in the hotel room when the police tried to apprehend him.
This Ras boy. When him come?
Give bike, give money give place to live.
But when him come today, get him dead. Get him dead.
Shoot him in the heart.
Kill him.

Yeah
Yeah

Pressure drop, oh, pressure
Oh, yeah, pressure put the drop on you
I said pressure drop
Oh, pressure
Oh, yeah
Pressure put the drop on you
I say you really dropped
Oh, you gotta believe it
Oh, what you are doing is wrong
I say you really dropped
Oh, you gotta believe it
Oh, what you are doing is wrong
Yeah
All right.
You run, but I'll find you.
I'll find you, you hear?
You know where you fucking live!
I'm gonna find you.
I'm gonna find you anyway.
Oh, yeah
Pressure put the drop on you
Anybody see Jose?
- Must have gone underground.
- Must be lookin' police protection.
- Him not comin' for money this week.
- For what? Ivan fixed that.
- Something else happened now.
- Whatever happened, the guy Ivan is our boss.
Hey, sis, you have any tune over there in the jukebox?
- You find the record yet, man?
- Well, it was put back here a long time ago.
Find the record.
Find it.
El Numero Uno socks the sound of blood and soul!
Hey, good evening everybody.
Welcome to the Big T show, back in my home where the sweet soul sisters roam.
My mojo workin', and my soul sort of cookin' and snookin'.
Like they say, the "T" thing goes for four hours long,
- and it's the sound of soul and big boss country here.
I hear my ring-a-ling.
Let's see what's happening.
Hi. Hello. Good evening, chicaboo. How are you?
You wanna hear that song again?
You know something?
All the other jocks been gettin' this call all day... for this big bad song about the runaway guy.
I wonder what he's doing now. I think he's gettin' his thing together too.
We'll play it for you.
That's the same one I had for you.
So here we go.
We're gonna do it for you right now.
- That guy is sort of turning the nation over, getting everybody...
Wow. I got it for you here.
- So it goes something like this.
Dig it, huh?
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Well, they tell me of a pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're born and when you die
They never seem to hear even your cry
So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine
And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall
One and all
Ooh, the harder they come
The harder they'll fall
One and all
I can't make this record die again.
The oppressors are trying to keep me down
Yes, I can usually do it, man, but it's gone too far now.
It's on the charts.
You know I always cooperate with the police, man, but this time...
I know how you feel, but I wanna catch him myself.
Do me a favor.
You tell me when you catch him, so I can get him to make another record for me before you string him up.
Hey, what are you doing in the man's car?
- You can drive?
- Yes.
Drive.
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try
Try and try
Try and try
You'll succeed at last
Mmm-hmm-mmm, oh, yeah
Persecution you must bear
Win or lose
You got to get your share
Got your mind set on a dream
You can get it though hard it may seem now
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try
Sidney, how much time I lock you up?
Three times.
Yes, sir.
How much time I let you off?
Plenty times.
Plenty times.
You remember the number of times you find yourself up in my yard... when you go down to the police station, when you need help?
- Yes, sir.
- You remember the number of times I help you?
- Hey?
- Yes, sir.
How come you know I lookin' for Ivan for the last two weeks, and you hidin' Ivan in your swamps and don't tell me?
Since when another dirty criminal like yourself mean more to you than me?
You believe him can help you more than me? Hey?
- Answer me. You believe him can help you more than me?
- No, sir.
Then why the backside you hidin' him for? What is going on?
You think him smarter than me...
because him have a hundred places to hide, and I can't find him?
It's not because him smart
I can't find him.
It's because you're all foolish... and all believe because I so busy chasin' Ivan now I forget about you.
But I stop chase Ivan now.
I gonna start chase you.
All of you, and as of this week no more ganja come into this town, you hear me?
Not a stick, not a spliff, not even a puff.
I'm going to starve you.
Let me see how much you love
Ivan when your belly empty.
Take one more.
Film finish.
- When I can get them?
- About tomorrow evening.
- Now.
- But it will take me at least...
Now.
All right.
Come this way.
- Last one, that?
- Yes.
Fitz.
- He's busy.
- Okay. I'll wait.
By the way, they catch the wild guy yet?
I don't hear any news about him, but I don't want 'em catch him.
I like the excitement.
The boy is great!
All right.
You can come in.
Fitz, why so quiet?
- Backside!
- Come. So.
- Fitz, you have a pen?
- Hey.
- What you want a pen for?
- Autograph, man. Autograph.
- Right here.
- Don't you have one to spare?
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Rest.
This is the last one, sir.
Send this one to the editor.
Make sure him get it.
All right.
Backside.
But you can't expect me not to publish a picture like this.
But this is a fantastic picture.
You don't want to see it?
- I see you banned the record.
- Yes.
- And you never had the courtesy to tell me.
- I don't understand you, Hilton.
I called you and asked you for your help. I called you once.
Am I to understand now that the police is out telling people what they must listen to?
Yes, if it glorifies crime.
So the record get the people all excited about this guy.
He's a criminal they're gonna catch anyhow.
It's no big deal.
What I don't understand is when you start fooling with the hit parade.
When you fool around with that then they know something is wrong.
- That's when you make the guy into a big deal.
- I can't stop now.
I wanna talk to you.
I hear you stopped the ganja trade too.
- Yes, but I didn't know that interested you.
- Naturally.
This is the only thing that brings money to this area.
You know something?
No hit parade, no ganja.
Hmm, you better catch him fast.
Once these jokers get hungry enough to start tradin' without you, then you're finished.
And then law and order finish in this entire area. You understand that, don't you?
I going.
See the man there.
Shoot! Fire!
Why you not warn me they was coming?
What happened, Elsa?
How him feeling?
Fever gone.
I thank God.
If we don't have to give more blood, everything will be all right.
The doctor says he must have good food.
Why is the police raging?
Till last night, them lock up Duffus and Midnight Cowboy.
As you know, the bike sell already.
What about the fishing?
To tell you the truth, you know, that boat, it sell a long, long time ago, you know.
Even when Ivan was here, you never had it?
No.
You hear from Ivan?
No.
I wonder how his shoulder getting on.
- What time Jose coming?
- Soon come.
What I tell him, sir?
Dollar fifty not bad.
Resume.
What we waiting for?
Can't resume just like that.
They want something more.
They won't resume until they get Ivan.
Anybody see him?
- No.
- My belly empty. My baby belly empty too.
We couldn't just give up Ivan like that.
Business is business, you know well, man.
What do you say, Pedro?
Pedro not say nothin'?
Pressure don't reach him yet.
Ivan.
How your shoulder?
Painful, you know.
All right. This is supposed to drive down the pain, you know.
I hear some people sayin' they catch me.
No news, man. Propaganda.
Pure propaganda.
I sent them a picture.
How come they don't publish it?
Compulsory.
Everything quiet.
I don't like it.
So what's happening in the trade?
Well, most of the boys holding out.
But I don't like what I hear.
What?
Jose.
Him offer some of the boys a raise... in export.
But that is what I after.
Some of them get what they look for now.
But now that they get what them want and nobody see me, they might forget me.
No, man.
Some of us still backing you, you know, to get rid of Jose altogether.
But you'd better try to get away before it's too late.
I'm not running, Pedro.
Yes. Freddie.
Him get a job on a boat.
And him can get you to Cuba.
And you'd get a big welcome there.
Yes.
Revolutionary to Ras.
Could get a doctor to fix me shoulder too.
True.
Go down to the coast tomorrow and wait there.
And the boat will pick you up at the key.
All right.
But I have to see Elsa and Rupert before I go.
You will see them, man.
You'll see them.
Sitting here in limbo
But I know it won't be long
Sitting here in limbo
Like a bird without a song
Well, they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on
Sitting here in limbo
Waiting for the dice to roll
Sitting here in limbo
Got some time to search my soul
Well, they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on
I don't know where life will lead me
But I know where I've been
I can't say what life will show me
But I know what I've seen
Tried my hand at love and friendship
But all that is past and gone
This little boy is moving on
Sitting here in limbo
It's all right, Rupert. Never mind.
Never mind.
Never mind.
Well, I hope the ambulance won't come, you know.
I prefer no send him to the hospital.
When he comes out of the hospital, it's the same thing all over again.
But, Elsa,
I can't stand him cry, you know.
When the trade going to start again?
They want Ivan, you know.
Definite.
All the boys said them ready to start.
What you say?
I say no.
What you say, Elsa?
You know what I say, Pedro.
Every game I play, I lose.
- Yes?
- I want to talk to you, sir.
I was just going out.
But I can spare you a few minutes.
Mr. Ray, the traders don't know where him is, sir.
They don't know. They don't tell me, sir. Them don't know, sir!
- Hmm.
- You know what gonna happen?
Them gonna start without me, and I won't be able to control them 'cause them hungry now.
If they start again,
I'm going to lock them up.
Don't matter. Them gonna start again because them desperate.
If them start without me, none of us will be able to control them.
Any criminal can come trade and don't have to pay no protection money.
- That's your problem.
- My problem, sir?
Look what policeman you have, and them can't find. You want me to find him.
You have a million and one policeman.
Right, sir?
But me one must go find him.
You don't understand, Jose?
I stopped chasin' Ivan now.
I want the traders to bring him to me.
- That is the only way this thing is going to start back.
Yes?
Yes, Reverend.
His woman came to you for help.
Okay, Corporal. Come, let's go.
Come on. Start the engines.
The gal said him leaving today.
What boat is he leaving on?
You realize if you don't help me now, you can never trade again.
- You want me hit him again?
- No, we're wasting time.
Come.
We'll get another boat.
Swim, Ivan! Swim!
Grab the rope!
Hold on, man!
Got your mind set on a dream
You can get it though hard it may seem now
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try
Try and try
Try and try
You'll succeed at last
I know it
We're going to do a frontal assault!
All right. Hold on.
Prepare to assault!
All right.
Don't worry with the army business.
One man just come out.
Who's the bad man?
Who can draw?
Come on out, one who can draw!
One who can draw, just come out!
Shut your mouth. He think the hero can't die until the last reel?
Send out one bad man!
Send him out!
Draw!
Well, the oppressors are trying to keep me down
Making me feel like a clown
And they think that they have got me on the run
I say "Forgive them, Lord they know not what they've done"
'Cause as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine
And then the harder they come the harder they'll fall
One and all
Harder they come the harder they'll fall
One and all
Oh, yeah
Red and white.
Blue suede shoes.
I'm Uncle Sam.
How do you do?
Give me five.
I'm still alive.
Ain't no luck.
I learned to duck.
Check my pulse.
It don't change.
Stay seventy two, come shine or rain.
Wave the flag.
Pop the bag, rock the boat, skin the goat.
Wave that flag.
Wave it wide and high.
Summertime done, come and gone.
Well this job I got, is just a little too hard, uh-huh.
Running out of money, Lord,
I need more pay.
I'm gonna wake up in the morning, Lord.
I'm gonna pack my bags.
I'm gonna beat it on down the line.
- I'm goin' down the line.
- (goin' down the line)
- Goin' down the line.
- (goin' down the line)
- Goin' down the line.
- (goin' down the line)
I'm gonna beat it on down the line.
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down.
You can't let go and you can't hold on.
You can't go back and you can't stand still.
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning...
Back to back, chicken shack.
Son of a gun, better change your act.
We're all confused.
What's to lose?
You can call this song
"The United States Blues."
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high.
Summertime done, come and gone, my oh my.
I'm Uncle Sam, that's who I am.
Been hiding out in a rock and roll band.
Shake the hand that shook the hand
Of P.T. Barnum and Charlie Chan.
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high.
Summertime done, come and gone, my oh my.
Back to back, chicken shack.
Son of a gun, better change your act.
We're all confused.
What's to lose?
You can call this song
"The United States Blues."
Wave that flag, wave it wide and high.
Summertime done, come and gone, my oh my.
Summertime done, come and gone, my oh my.
My oh my, my my my.
Oh my, oh my, oh my.
Summertime done,
Come and gone, my oh my.
I went down to the mountain,
I was drinking some wine.
I looked up into heaven,
Lord, I saw a mighty sign.
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white.
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight, uh huh huh.
Hey, Saturday night.
Well, uh-huh, one more Saturday night.
Saturday night.
Everybody's dancing down the local skating rink with a basement full of dynamite and live artillery.
Temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high.
Come the rocking strike of midnight, the whole place is gonna fly, uh huh.
Saturday night.
Well, uh-huh, one more Saturday night.
Saturday night.
I turn on Channel Six, the President comes on the news, says I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues.
His wife says don't get crazy,
Lord you know what to do.
Crank up that old Victrola, break out your rocking shoes, uh huh.
Hey, Saturday night.
Well, uh-huh, one more Saturday night.
Saturday night.
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth, thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it planet earth.
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord,
You'll know it when it comes.
When the rocking, rolling music meets the rising, shining sun, uh-huh.
Hey, Saturday night.
Well, uh-huh,
One more Saturday night.
Saturday night.
Easy now!
- Hey, another Saturday night.
- (one more Saturday night)
- You can party, get right.
- (one more Saturday night)
- Hey, another Saturday night.
- (one more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night.
- Hey, another Saturday night.
- (one more Saturday night!)
Hey, on a Saturday night.
- Hey! Hey, yeah!
- (one more Saturday night)
- Another Saturday night.
- (one more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night.
- Hey, another Saturday night.
- (one more Saturday night)
- Hey, yeah!
- (one more Saturday night)
- Another Saturday night.
- (one more Saturday night)
One more Saturday, one more, Saturday night.
Hey, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
And the camera roll.
- Anybody else?
- Hold it.
It's too late.
We'll get it together later on.
Just a moment we'd like to do something that's never been done before because there are men, for years and years, who've worked with the Dead, who've made it always possible, getting all this equipment up.
For once, let's really get them up.
They're shy, we're very, very crazy... the Grateful Dead crew.
Will you all come out here, please?
Come on!
Ram Rod, Steve, get your asses out here, come on.
Healy, Jackson, Joseph...
Let's go, everybody.
Get 'em all out here.
Here's the man, right there...
Ram Rod, right on!
Come on, Sparky.
Here he is, one of the best guys in the business, Bill Graham!
Billy, this is the proof.
For ten fuckin' years, they've done it.
Really, once again, for the crew.
Thank you very much.
You're a damned good audience!
Goin' down the road feeling bad.
Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- (bad, bad)
Don't wanna be treated this a way.
Going where the water tastes like wine.

Sling comin' down!
Goin' up!
I got your professional name all straightened out... Rego Park.
We're all getting paid here, you too!
Hey, Rego!
Oh, Bill, I've been fired!
Going where the climate suits my clothes.
Going where the climate suits my clothes.
Going where the climate suits my clothes.
Don't wanna be treated this a way.
Goin' down the road feeling bad.
Goin' down the road feeling bad.
You ready?
- Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- (bad, bad)
Don't wanna be treated this a way.
Hey, Bill!
Something might fall on you, Bill.
That's a warning, as a friend.
Sling comin' down!
I've got a plane to catch!
I've got a plane to catch.
What was your name?
Hey, Healy, you up there?
Okay. One, two, three!
Watch that, guys!
Okay.
Goin' down the road feeling bad.
Goin' down the road feeling bad.
- Goin' down the road feeling bad.

- (bad, bad)
Don't wanna be treated this a way.
I guess we should go to Benny.
I know. And then there's the main guy in regards to covering that whole front there.
That's gonna be something that we're gonna have to clear through him.
I think it might be better if you dart around behind all the stuff.
That's pretty hard.
There ain't that many holes, you know.
Well, I know but that's...
That's how few there are.
Try to get 'em over the top.
Think about it.
'Cause that would be the hippest.
- Then, you'd have the...
- But the scrim is so high.
Hey, man, I know, but you'll just have to get stuff to happen down here in the middle somewhere, by timing it.
That means it can only be that stuff I throw.
I can't set 'em up spray planes, I can't...
It's not your decision to make.
It's not my decision, either.
- Is Bill Graham here?
- He'll be here at 5:00.
It's not so much you guys, it's the people that you guys have had confrontations with during the years.
They see someone in here with colors on and they remember the time maybe he got stomped by seven Angels and goes fuckin' berserk.
I mean, I've seen it happen a dozen times.
A thousand...
Oh, you know what?
Sandy's flying out here from New York, and I know he's not taking his patch off, so he's coming a long way for nothing.
I say if Bill Graham thinks I'm that violent,
I ought to just knock him out and leave.
You know, give him his satisfaction.
Hold it now. Stopping!
What was it the sound system, or what?
Some of the Grateful Dead albums
I worked on...
I was a co engineer on several of their early albums.
You don't engineer no more, or what?
I've been...
The last couple of albums,
I've been going to the pressing plants and overseeing the actual record pressings to make sure the final product is high quality, but not actually working on the albums.
Now, I have my hands full.
Burned to the ground, but resurrected from the ashes.
We're always working on the piano tuning.
What is it about this guitar that makes it so...
Like most basses or guitars that you hear have one or two good tones on them.
This bass has many, many good tones and can simulate the sound of other basses.
It has lots of different filters on it, that capability of switching from one kind of sound like the same sound coming from all those speakers to one string coming from each of half of one of these stacks.
So in other words, each string from four different sets, so it bounces around depending on how I play it.
I'm talking to you like you're a person, because you look like a person, even with that camera on.
Getting a little carried away, there.
I'm not trying to do that on purpose.
The camera!
Yeah, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back.
Come on, come on, come on.
- We can play together.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute, yeah.
Truckin', got my chips cashed in.
Keep truckin' like the doodah man.
Together, more or less in line.
Just keep truckin' on.
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street.
Chicago, New York, Detroit, and it's all the same street.
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream.
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.
Dallas got a soft machine.
Houston, too close to New Orleans.
New York got the ways and means
- but just won't let you be.
- (no, no, no)
Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love.
Most of the time they're sitting and crying at home.
One of these days they know they better get going out of the door and down in the street all alone.
Truckin' like the doodah man.
Once told me,
"You gotta play your hand.
"Sometimes the cards ain't worth a dime if you don't lay 'em down."
Sometimes the lights all shining on me.
Other times I can barely see.
Lately it occurs to me...
What a long strange trip it's been.
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle you know she isn't the same.
Living on reds and vitamin C and cocaine.
All her friends can say is,
"Ain't it a shame?"
Truckin' off to Buffalo.
I been thinking you got to mellow slow.
It takes time.
You pick a place to go.
Just keep truckin' on.
Yeah, our happy home.
This is our mailing address.
That's it.
- That's where I live.
- Five days.
Sitting and staring out of the hotel window.
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again.
Well, I'd like to get some sleep before I travel.
But if you got a warrant,
I guess you're gonna come in.
Busted down on Bourbon Street, set up like a bowling pin.
Knocked down, it gets to wearing thin.
- They just won't let you be.
- (no, no, no)
You're sick of hanging around and you'd like to travel.
Get tired of traveling, you want to settle down.
Well, I guess they can't revoke your soul for trying.
Get out of the door, light out and look all around.
Sometimes the lights all shining on me.
All right!
Other times I can barely see.
What's that, Greg?
Chiclets.
Lately it occurs to me...
What a long strange trip it's been.
Truckin', I'm a going home, whoa, whoa, baby, back where I belong,
Back home, sit down and patch my bones, and get back truckin' on.
I would say we're pretty nuts.
What's it, three in the afternoon or something?
About three in the afternoon, the sidewalk, there'd be some cop runnin' up and down here saying,
"Stay back to this line," you know.
And people just sitting down, gettin' stoned, snortin' coke.
All week long, people are gonna be crazy out here.
How long have you guys been out here?
What'd we get here,
3:00 this morning?
- Where's your mother?
- My mother?
- She's probably at work right now...
- Whereabouts?
...worryin' about me being in line all day.
She works in Oakland.
She's a good mother.
How many people are tryin' to get in?
About seven... at least seven of us.
How many more do we need?
I don't know, we need lots,
'Cause there's always more that pop up.
- I just got one, though.
- I just got one, too.
Great.
Rock and roll!
Grateful Dead! Right on!
Have your tickets out and ready!
Have your tickets out and ready!
Have your tickets out and ready!
Have your tickets out and ready!
You can't carry it in.
Have your ticket out and ready, please!
Have your ticket ready.
There are two doors.
You can't carry that pack in.
I'm sorry, sir.
Thank you very kindly.
March right in and have a good time!
Have 'em out and ready, please.
Have your ticket out and ready.
Have your ticket out and ready.
Have your tickets out and ready.
Have your tickets out and ready, please.
You just wait, man.
They promised that they would play tonight.
Shit, man.
Grateful Dead! Yeah!
Tell me about the Dead.
The Dead, man, gets to be the best band.
No doubt about it, man.
Wherever the Dead are, you see the people, you know?
- Huh?
- What makes 'em the best?
Their sound system, man.
Their music and Jerry Garcia.
He's got it together, man.
They've been together for the last ten years.
They've been together longer than almost any group I know of.
You know, they've got it, man.
They're the best.
- They're the best.
- Besides Jesus.
- What's that?
- Acid, yeah.
I'm caught here
I'm going to try to get in.
You know, the Grateful Dead.
Sure, I have a ticket.
Wanna see it?
Well, you can't stand right there
I know. I'm just trying to get my space together so that I can go into the show.
I just came from a phone call.
Fantastic!
Oh, Donna Jean!
Right outside this lazy summer home.
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no.
Right outside the lazy gate... of winter's summer home... wondering where the nuthatch winters.
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away.
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world.
But the heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own.
Wake now discover that you are the song that the morning brings.
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own.
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own.
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home.
Sometimes we ride on your horses.
Sometimes we walk alone.
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own.
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world.
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own.
Wake now discover that you are the song that the morning brings.
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own.
Say something intelligent.
Bottom line of the whole scene is very simply stated.
There is nothing like a Grateful Dead concert. Period.
Never will be.
If the Dead were to die,
I'd have reason to cry, because the band I used to see would be a cold memory.
But if the Dead were to live, free concerts they'd give.
Jerry G. on guitar would bring 'em in from near and far.
If the Dead were to cease, there'd be no street peace.
We take hold the power, skin the cat and take a shower.
But if the Dead live long, we'll be singing their songs.
We'll all be so glad
Mama hated Diesel so bad.
Grateful Dead!
This is just fucked up, though.
This fuckin' film, man, making cash off everybody.
This is the biggest pile of shit
I've ever seen the Dead ever do.
- You're full of shit!
- Aww, you're nuts, man.
If this film is just...
Five nights of this show, man.
You can have it filmed one night and charge more.
- Would you would you listen to me?
- Yeah.
This film is nothing more than a record album on film.
It kinda gets in the way of everybody who's here, though.
Four or five years from now, you're gonna be grateful that this thing was filmed.
You are gonna pay
4 or 5 dollars to see this film.
I don't know if I'll be alive five years from now!
- Well, neither do I, but if you are alive...
- Well, you're crazy as shit, man!
...you'll be in that theater, and I bet you...
- You wanna bet money on it?
- Yeah.
What's your name?
I'll take your address and I'll...
- My name is John Williams.
- John Williams?
- Yeah.
- Sam Hughes.
- Hi, Sam.
- Okay, I'll bet you anything that I will not be at that movie.
It's always good to see a real Dead Head around...
Yeah, why are you so uptight?
You feel you're being exploited?
- Yes.
- In what way?
Who is going to get royalties?
It's like this if this little thing, which there's no way it's gonna be in the movie, and there were five million people watching this movie all over the world... and I was being in the movie right here, but this is ten minutes of my time...
Say this was all in the movie, these people are being charged, do I get royalties, would I?
No.
St. Stephen!
- Crazy, man!
- You're crazy!
He's crazy because he doesn't realize...
He does not realize...
He's spaced out.
He wants a residual.
I hope this movie comes true, man, really.
It will! We know it will!
The omnipotent Grateful Dead.
Sugar Magnolia, blossoms blooming.
Head's all empty and I don't care.
Saw my baby down by the river.
I knew she'd have to come up soon for air.
Sweet blossom come on under the willow.
We can have high times if you'll abide.
We can discover the wonders of nature... rolling in the rushes down by the riverside.
She's got everything delightful.
She's got everything I need.
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double.
Pays my ticket when I speed.
She comes skimming through rays of violet.
She can wade in a drop of dew.
She don't come and I don't follow.
Waits backstage while I sing to you.
She can dance a Cajun rhythm.
Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive.
She's my summer love in the spring, fall and winter.
She can make happy any man alive.
Sugar Magnolia.
Ringin' that blue bell.
Caught up in sunlight.
Yeah, come on out singing,
I'll walk you in the sunshine.
Come on honey, come home with me.
She's got everything delightful.
She's got everything I need.
A breeze in the pines in the summer night moonlight.
Crazy in the sunlight, yes indeed.
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying,
When the moon is halfway down, sometimes when the night is dying,
I take me out and I wander around.
I walk around.
Sunshine daydream.
Walk you in the tall trees.
Going where the wind goes.
Blooming like a red rose.
Come on over sweetly.
Light out singing
I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
Well, come on, come on over daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
Come on, come on from a sweet dream.
Sunshine daydream.
Wading in a cold stream.
Goin' out your window.
Goin', goin' where the wind goes.
They're never going to miss us.
Light out singing.
I got you in the morning sunshine.
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
Come on, come on over daydream.
Sunshine daydream
- Come on, come on from a sweet dream.
- (come on from a sweet dream)
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
- Come on, come on.
- (hey yeah, yeah)
Sunshine daydream.
- Well, come on Sweet Magnolia daydream.
- (comin' from a sweet dream)
Sunshine daydream.
When I dream of a daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
- Come on, come on, come on over daydream
- (comin' from a sweet dream, yeah)
- Sunshine daydream
- (dream)
- Yeah!
- (yeah)
Sunshine daydream.
Sunshine daydream.
- Lord, come on over daydream!
- (yeah, yeah)
Sunshine daydream.
Sweet Magnolia daydream.
Thank you all, goodnight!
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's nice.
- You're not kidding.
It's always this... a group of the same faces, basically.
And then, there's new people keep coming in over the years, and then older people phase off, you know, advance on to different trips and you don't see their faces as much.
But it's like a continuous trip.
The first concert I went to was the Dead at Fillmore with...
It was on a Sunday afternoon at 1:00 or so, I don't know, when they used to play afternoons at Fillmore with the Airplane and Big Brother, and that used to be really big.
I mean, you never get to see those three at once.
- They used to do it every weekend.
- Really.
See the Dead out at the Panhandle and Golden Gate Park.
But those were the old days.
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine... and my tunes were played on the harp unstrung, would you hear my voice... come through the music?
Would you hold it near, as it were your own?
It's a hand me down.
The thoughts are broken.
Perhaps they're better... left unsung.
I don't know.
Don't really care.
Let there be songs... to fill the air.
When did you first start going to the concerts?
I guess about 1967 in New York.
I remember in the Fillmore and Hartford, Connecticut, and L.A. and Charlotte, North Carolina, and Philadelphia, and just a whole bunch of places.
And all when all the acid things were going on, all the heavy kind of generational changes and everything that was happening in the country, they seemed to really be reflecting that, and so was I.
And so, it just really meant a lot to me.
See that girl bare-footing along?
Whistling and singing, she's a carrying on.
Got laughing in her eyes, dancing in her feet.
She's a neon light diamond.
She can live on the street.
Hey, hey, come right away.
Come and join the party every day.
Hey, hey, come right away.
Come and join the party every day.
Well, everybody's dancing in a ring around the sun.
Nobody's finished, we ain't even begun.
So take off your shoes, child, and take off your hat.
Try on your wings and find out where it's at.
Hey, hey, come right away.
Come and join the party every day.
Hey, hey, come right away.
Come and join the party every day.
Take a vacation, fall out for a while.
Summer's coming in, winter's going out in style.
Well, lie down smoking, honey.
Have yourself a ball,
'cause your mother's down in Memphis.
Won't be back till the fall.
Hey, hey, come right away.
Come and join the party every day.
Hey, hey, come right away.
Come and join the party every day.
Some folks look for answers, others look for fights.
Some folks up in the treetops just a looking for their kites.
But I can tell your future.
Whoa, just look what's in your hand.
But I can't stop for nothing.
I'm just playing in the band.
Playing.

Standing on a tower, world at my command.
You just keep turning while I'm playing in the band.
And if a man among you got no sin upon his hand, let him cast a stone at me for playing in the band.
Playing.
Playing in the band.
Daybreak.
Daybreak on the land.
There's no relationship that
I've ever been able to hear on tapes between the way I feel and the way it went down, you know what I mean?
Doesn't matter how I feel.
- It doesn't?
- No.
I haven't been able to hear it matter.
It matters how I feel to me, of course, 'cause that...
You know, I feel that way, you know.
I come off the stage, boy, sometimes really, really upset, you know.
And when I was younger,
I would get even more upset
I'd get more crazy.
I would want it to be really good, you know, and I'd think, wow, it's not where it should be.
It's almost there, but it's not there.
And then I'd get really angry.
I remember one time, we were... we did the Carousel, and we recorded.
I got really upset at the end of the set,
'cause I thought it was just horrible for some reason.
It seemed like everything was a struggle.
And I got real pissed off at Phil and I grabbed him and threw him down this little flight of stairs.
You know, it's like, man,
I've never done that.
And Phil... I've been really tight with him for years.
I was that freaked out, you know, and high, too, you know, flipped out, man.
Music was fucked, you know.
And then we listened to these tapes months later and ended up using 'em on our album, man
They were... You know, they were...
You know, they were crackling with energy.
They were amazing, but that's when I knew, well, fuck, I've just got to learn to keep my mouth shut, you know, and just not even think about whether... whether it seemed like it was happening to me or not.
He's very creative, but you kind of have to kick his ass every now and again.
I have found that, generally speaking,
I create best when somebody holds a gun to my head.
I use a telephone to call him up and ask him if he's written any music so I can write some words,
'cause I've given up on trying to write words and have him write music later.
- And I like it that way.
- Yeah. Gives him the upper hand.
I call myself a four-sided schizophrenic, because you have to have four separate ideas going, all right, and then a single thing here.
It's more than patting your head, rubbing your stomach, because you're doing it with four things.
And that sort of relates as to why when you get that down in music, in drumming, particularly, then you get so you can be dancing, and that is really fine,
'cause you sit back there and it feels just like you're dancing.
You're playing and the groove is just right and the kicks aren't made the accents and the rolls, they're not made, they're just into the flow.
And that's the kind of music I like.
Playing.
Playing in the band.
Daybreak.
Daybreak on the la
Playing.
Playing in the band.
Daybreak.
Daybreak on the land.
Playing.
Like the wave upon on the sand.
Daybreak.
While I'm playing in the band.
I'm waitin' for Bob, man.
- So? Bob who?
- Weir.
Listen, I'm doing some electrical work at his house.
What's your name?
Okay, listen.
We're doing work at the house,
I gave him my card,
I'm his chef, he says come on down, give me the card, you'll get in.
You're either on the list or you're not.
What's your name?
My name's Levy.
Just give him my card, he'll say let 'em in.
- Give us your card.
- I gave it to this dude.
I'll take it.
So, now, if you'd come to that door, there, and then come out, then we could've let you back in.
But if you come out the side door, we have no way of tellin' you whether you were sick or not.
But how about the fact that I...
You have to come out this door here.
I know but, I'm from New York
I've come 3,000 miles to see this concert.
Yeah, but darlin', you should read the signs.
Can you get Bob Weir for me?
I gave your card, what more can I do?
Now, hush...
Anyway, get out of here.
I wouldn't come out here to see it and not, you know, have a ticket to get in.
I'm not gonna come 3,000 miles...
What's up, miss?
What's the problem?
Well, I came out the side door because I needed air and it was cool air, and I walked around and now I want to come back in.
I have absolutely no way of knowing that.
Thanks a lot, love.
You keep it.
- I don't want it.
- All right.
- What's your first name?
- Jeff.
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.
Thank you.
Well, honey, you told me you're not walking around...
Do you know a guard or somebody that saw you walk out, if he comes here and tells me that he's seen you inside,
I'll let you back in.
All right, I'll go and look for him.
Tickets only.
Tickets only.
Ticket, sir?
No.
Sorry, we're all sold out.
When all the cards are down.
There's nothing left to see.
There's just the pavement left.
And broken dreams.
In the end there's still that song.
Comes crying like the wind.
Down every lonely street.
That's ever been.
Stella Blue.
Stella Blue.
I've stayed in every blue light cheap hotel
Can't win for trying.
Dust off those rusty strings just one more time.
Gonna make them shine.
It all rolls into one.
And nothing comes for free.
There's nothing you can hold... for very long.
And when you hear that song.
Crying like the wind.
It seems like all this life... was just a dream.
Stella Blue.
Stella Blue.
Next.
- Yeah, can I get a hot dog?
- Wet hot dog.
- Anything else?
- Yeah, can I...
- Pardon?
- Can I get some mustard on it?
Mustard's right over there, sir.
Sixty cents. Out of ten.
Do you like any particular group more than another?
- Do you like...
- Sha Na Na.
- What?
- That's my favorite, Sha Na Na.
- Sha Na Na?
- Yeah.
What do you think of the Dead?
I think their music's too loud.
I don't care for loud music.
That's why I like Sha Na Na.
I do.
Drivin' that train high on cocaine,
Casey Jones you better watch your speed.
Trouble ahead, trouble behind, and you know that notion just crossed my mind.
This old engine makes it on time,
Leaves Central Station about a quarter to nine, hits River Junction at seventeen to.
At a quarter to ten you know it's traveling again
Drivin' that train high on cocaine,
Casey Jones you better watch your speed.
Trouble ahead, trouble behind,
And you know that notion just crossed my mind.
Margaret Mead should be here.
- Margaret who?
- Margaret Mead, honey.
- What for?
- What do you mean?
This is it. This is what she always wanted to do.
Really, really, really, fuckin' really!
Really, really, really, really, really, man, really!
Trouble with you is the trouble with me.
Got two good eyes but we still don't see.
Come round the bend.
You know it's the end.
The fireman screams and the engine just gleams
Drivin' that train high on cocaine,
Casey Jones you better watch your speed.
Trouble ahead, trouble behind, and you know that notion just crossed my mind.

What's left of the vineyards?
What do you want, red, white or green?
White.
Green?
Green might be interesting.
Suck on it, suck on it, suck on it.
Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey.
Walk me out in the morning dew today.
Can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey.
I can't walk you out in the morning dew today.
I thought I heard a baby cry this morning.
I thought I heard a baby... cry today.
Thought I heard a baby... cry this morning.
You didn't hear no baby... cry today.
Where have all the people gone.
My honey?
Where have all the people gone... today?
There's no need for you to be worrying about all those people.
You never see those people... anyway.
I thought I heard a young man... mourn this morning

Thank you.
Thanks a whole lot.
We're gonna change a little bit of equipment up here and play some more in a few minutes.
Thank you.
Where the fuck's the water?
Water, just plain, old cold water.
Lots of it.
Where have they taken my guitar case to?
That's the stuff.
Hey, Barney, look who's here!
I know!
I saw her last night for the first time.
Got some cake?
One more time, anybody?
- One more time?
- One more time?
- What do you want to do?
- Let's decide.
I guarantee you, this way is the only way you'll get out this door.
Wait a minute, where's the drummer?
Some of you folks might remember our old drummer,
Mickey Hart, who's playing with us tonight.
Fresh out of a mental institution, and a brand new man.
He still has uncontrollable urges to throw things.
Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans, way back up in the woods among the evergreens, there is an old cabin made of earth and wood, where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode.
He never learned to read or write so well, but he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell.
Go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny B. Goode.
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack, go sit up in the trees by the railroad track.
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade, strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made.
People passing by would all stop and say
"My but that little country boy can play!"
Go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny B. Goode.
His papa told him
"Someday you will be a man."
"You will be the leader of a big old band."
"Many people coming from miles around"
"will hear you play your music when the sun goes down."
"Maybe someday your name will be in lights,"
"saying Johnny B. Goode tonight."
Go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny, go, go!
Go, Johnny B. Goode.
Thank you all.
See you sometime.
What am I going to do?
I'm going straight home and get into bed.
I've been here since 9:00 yesterday morning, and I must go home and get into bed.
I'm going straight home and get into bed.
Straight home and get into bed.
Go home before you kill yourself.
- Goodnight!
- Goodnight!
Annie laid her head down in the roses.
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair.
I don't know, maybe it was the roses.
All I know,
I could not leave her there.
I don't know, it must have been the roses.
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair.
I don't know, maybe it was the roses.
All I know,
I could not leave her there.
Ten years, the waves rolled the ships home from the sea.
Thinking, well, how it may blow in all good company.
If I tell another what your own lips told to me,
Let me lay beneath the roses, let my eyes no longer see.
I don't know, it must have been the roses.
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair.
I don't know, maybe it was the roses.
All I know,
I could not leave her there.
Everybody seems to be ready.
Are you ready?
For the first time in three years, the greatest rock 'n 'roll band in the world, the Rolling Stones!
The Rolling Stones!!
We're gonna have a look at you.
We're gonna see how beautiful you are.
All right!
Oh, New York City, you talk a lot.
Let's have a look at you.
Let's have a look at New York City.
Well, all right!
Welcome to the breakfast show.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're just gonna wake up.
Well, all right!
Charlie's good tonight, isn't he?
I think you really-- you really dressed up tonight.
Aren't they?
We'd like to see how you look.
Can we see how they look?
Let's have a look how they look.
Come on.
Oh, we just want to see how they look.
Ohhh, we couldn't see you!
We couldn't see you.
It's really hard to see this together, isn't it?
It will take time.
- What?
- Eight weeks.
Eight weeks.
Eight weeks.
Do you think you can do it that quick?
This gives us the freedom.
All you guys watching us.
We may only be on you for a minute, then go to almost anything.
This is Stefan Ponek,
KSAN Radio, San Francisco.
Well, the Rolling Stones' tour of the United States is over.
They wound it up with a free concert at the Altamont Speedway for more than 300,000 people.
There were four births, four deaths and an awful lot of scuffles reported.
We received word that someone was stabbed to death... in front of the stage by a member of the Hell's Angels.
Nothing's confirmed on that.
We were there.
We didn't see it, but we did see a lot.
We want to know what you saw.
Our phones are open.
We'd like to hear from you. What was the Altamont free concert like?
The Angels did as they saw best in the difficult situation.
As far as I'm concerned, they were people who were here... who tried to help in their own way.
- Right? You know?
- Hmm. Right.
If people didn't dig it,
I'm sorry.
That was Sam Cutler, one of the organizers of the free concert.
I think we've got one of the Hell's Angels on the line.
Sonny Barger.
Have I got that right, Sonny?
- Yeah.
- Okay, what's up?
I didn't go there to police nothing, man.
I ain't no cop. I ain't never gonna pretend to be a cop.
And this Mick Jagger, like-- put it all on the Angels, man.
Like, he used us for dupes, man.
And as far as I'm concerned, we were the biggest suckers for that idiot that I can ever see.
And you know what?
They told me... if I could sit on the edge of the stage... so nobody would climb over me, you know,
I could drink beer until the show was over.
That's what I went there to do.
But you know what?
When they started messing over our bikes, they started it.
I don't know if you think we pay $50 for them things... or steal them or pay a lot for them or what.
Ain't nobody gonna kick my motorcycle.
And they might think because they're in a crowd of 300,000 people... that they can do it and get away with it.
But when you're standing there, looking at something that's your life, and everything you've got is invested in that thing, and you love that thing better than anything in the world, and you see a guy kick it, you know who he is.
You're gonna get him.
And you know what? They got got.
I am not no peace creep by any sense of the word.
And you can call them people flower children and this and that.
Some of them people was loaded on some drugs... that it's just too bad we wasn't loaded on... because they come running up the hill, yelling "Aaaah" and jump on somebody.
And it wasn't even always jumping on Angels.
But when they jumped on an Angel, they got hurt.
Well done, Sonny.
I think I remember him.
Do you?
No, I'm not certain.
I don't really remember what he looked like.
There was a couple of them before we went on.
They were really very nice, you know?
A couple of them guys.
It's just, uh--
I don't know.
I mean, the way they cleared the path, for instance, was incredible.
Were you there? Was you in the party that had to be led to the stage?
- My goodness.
- I saw what they did, yeah.
That was insane.
What did they do?
Well, it's just the way they did it, you know?
It's very, very--
'Cause before that,
I didn't really think there was anything going on, you know?
Really. I didn't hear anything
'cause we were right at the side.
Oh, dear, what a shame!
KSAN Radio here. The violence at Altamont was completely unexpected.
The Rolling Stones had performed for overflow audiences... without incident in major cities across the United States.
Okay, roll it.
Thank you.
Well, all right.
Well, all right!
Well, all right!
Well, all right!
Are you any more satisfied as far as your career goes?
Do you mean sexually or, or philosophically?
- Both.
- Yeah, we're more satisfied now sexually, aren't--
How about philosophically and financially?
Financially dissatisfied, uh, you know.
Uh, sexually satisfied, philosophically trying.
- Rubbish.
- There's a question here on the right.
I read in one of the papers that you'll be giving... a free concert in San Francisco.
We are doing a free concert in San Francisco.
- When?
- On December 6.
And, uh, the location is not
Golden Gate Park, unfortunately, but it's somewhere adjacent to it which is a bit larger.
It's creating sort of a microcosmic society, you know, which sets the example to the rest of America... as to how one can behave in large gatherings.
This is Mel Belli, the lawyer in San Francisco.
Uh, I'm-I'm talking for the Rolling Stones.
We've got their managers and their principals here.
I've just heard that you've offered them your speedway... for their performance on Saturday, is that right?
- That is correct.
- This is an open phone so we can all talk on it.
What I'm trying to find out is what we can do to do this concert.
For the last 36 hours, I've stood my organization on its ear, Mr. Belli.
I don't know anything about this.
I'm coming in late and trying to straighten something out.
So tell me exactly what it is without--
Yeah. My first area of policy concern:
I do not want this gesture... on the part of Mr. Jagger... to cost me five cents.
If a blade of grass is torn down, they are going to build it up again, you know?
I was involved in Woodstock.
I've represented rock groups, and I've been involved, both as an attorney and as an executive, with festivals.
No matter what anybody tells you, they're a pain in the ass.
Don't turn me into a proctologist.
Just tell me what I can do here.
Well, somebody tell me why I should want to get this concert going.
Are you trying to make it so they can't do this?
No, I want it to happen, but I'm not prepared to rebuild my goddamn racetrack.
Will you come up and see if you can work with me on this thing?
I'd love to work with you, Mr. Belli, but are you working with Mr. Jagger?
I haven't met Mr. Jagger.
I've only met these other people here.
- Have you met Mr. Schneider?
- Yes, he's right here in the office.
All right, fine.
He knows what happened at our meeting this afternoon.
Then call me back and with the thought... see if you could come up tomorrow morning.
- You and I can see what we can do with this damn thing.
- Okay.
All right, call me back.
There's no way to do the concert except in that location.
As it stands now, you're gonna have at least 100,000 kids there by Saturday.
You don 't have any alternative.
The only thing you can do... is to do an affidavit, temporary restraining order and talk to one of the judges.
So that brings us down to this.
Um, I'll call one of the judges right now.
That's your only chance of forcing these people to do it.
Now, don't scare off from these people.
If I were advising them,
I'd tell them to hide out.
Because right when they're coming out, you'll-- sh-ta-boom!
- Yeah, but it doesn't come in till the solo.
- I know, I know.
- What is that?
- What?
- Stickin' out of your pocket.
- Cousin Minnie says,
"How delicious!"
I'm taking it home for Robert.
Y'all come back now, ya hear?
That's one more song.
That should be it.
I found it. I found it.
Anybody in?
Is my local groupie in?
Hello, darling.
How are you?
When are the bags coming up, Ronnie?
Stew's gotta get 46 pieces up.
We're gonna do--
We're gonna do a slow blues for you now, people.
You like that?
I like it.
This thing is going on.
The Chronicle is coming out with a story that it's off.
- This has been building up for a long time.
- Well, it's off and on.
Everybody wants a piece of the pie.
All right, let's see if we can get some facts... to build together on an affidavit here.
So we'll have that available and then a very short order to show cause.
The sheriff wants to know who's going to go to the bathroom and where.
They've got a nice little bucolic community there--
They know practically when every john is flushed... and the orderly habits of the bathroom of all of their, uh, voters.
Dick Carter's on the line.
He's offering us the speedway at Altamont.
Hello, Dick.
This is Mel Belli for the Stones.
If they were to perform in the speedway, is the speedway open so that they can be seen... from the people that can't get in?
I'm sure we can work something out.
I want the publicity.
You want the publicity?
Well, you take the publicity.
The Rolling Stones don't want any money.
It's for charity.
- So I'll take the money.
- All right.
All right.
Well, why don't I do this?
Why don't I talk with these people here... and then I'll get back with you... and then if we have to sign anything up... and if you need any insurance, which I'm sure you will want, and all the rest of that stuff,
I'll work with you in the morning.
- Okay.
- I'll call you back later, after I talk with them, Dick.
Bye. He's offered the Altamont Speedway.
- There's not enough room.
- There's not time to move it.
We got to tear down a stage and the scaffolding.
The phones are in. The generators are there. Everything is left to go.
It's anticipated that the amount of kids now traveling across country-- you may have anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 kids... starting to arrive sometime tomorrow.
They're all lining up at the airports from as far away as New York.
- Now? You gotta be kidding.
- You have no idea what goes on here.
It's an amazing phenomenon.
It's like the lemmings of the sea.
- Mike Lang is on the line.
- Yeah, Mike?
John says that he doesn't think you can make it over there at the Altamont Speedway.
- Do you want to talk directly to Mike?
- Yeah.
Mike, I got the impression from everybody where you are... that there was no way of moving to that speedway.
We can do it.
Nobody wants to, but if we have to, we can.
Just a quick question.
You were at Woodstock, and you've now been to Altamont?
- Right.
- How does it stack up?
Do you have the room?
I think we have the room, sure.
I think we can hold as many people as want to come.
Can you change locations that fast?
We had a much bigger operation to change at Woodstock.
I don't think we'll have much problem.
We're just dealing with a free concert.
That's what we want to present.
And I think that's what the Stones are up to. They want to play here.
Is this going to be Woodstock West?
Well, it's going to be San Francisco.
Do you have any special feelings about this kind of a concert?
This spontaneous, free--
Well, it's not so much--
I don't think it's a complete concert.
The concert is just--
I think it's an excuse.
You know, because, like, the thing is, it's just like everyone coming and having a good time.
The concert's like the proscenium of a theater.
It's like an excuse for everyone to just sort of, you know, get together... and, like, talk to each other and sleep with each other... ball each other and get very stoned... and just have a nice night out and a good day, you know?
- I mean, do you understand?
- I do.
It's not just like getting up there and seeing... the Grateful Airplane and the Rolling, Rolling Dead.
And now, Ike and Tina Turner.
Thank you.
I don't know what they paid for them-- the costumes-- but is there any way--
Good. It's nice to have a chick occasionally.
Far out.
Sorry you had to wait.
Oh, yeah!
Thank you kindly.
I think I busted a button on my trousers.
Hope they don't fall down.
It's that jumping around.
I'll have to do it up again.
Whoo! You don't want my trousers to fall down now, do you?
We're gonna--
We're gonna kiss you good-bye.
And we leave you to kiss each other good-bye.
- Hello?
- Yes, Mel?
- Yes, we still have you.
- I got you in an echo.
Think you can pick it up?
I'm practicing. I'm going on first before the Rolling Stones.
Can we get you to pick up the phone like before?
Well, what it is now, we're waiting for Mr. Carter to come in.
But I've just had a letter read to me... where he said that he very definitely... wants the Stones and the concert there.
So, as of this minute, we're intending that the show go on.
They have 200,
300 people working... and it's going to be quite a problem to get the thing set up at the Altamont Speedway.
But it will be, and it will start at 10:00.
Now, that's where we stand.
I'm waiting for Mr. Carter now.
Uh, let me ask and see.
Are the Rolling Stones all in town?
- Not yet. They're coming tonight.
- They're coming in tonight.
But everybody's ready, and they're all set to go.
That's where we are.
Is this Mr. Carter?
Sheriff, Mr. Carter just came in.
Now, could we talk a little bit?
I can put this on the box so that we can all hear.
And I think, to start,
Mr. Carter has expressed... his willingness to have this on his private property over there.
But the question is of this narrow road to come in there.
Do you foresee any problems on that?
Well, that basically is the Highway Patrol's problem, and they foresee problems.
How many cars can Mr. Carter park on his property?
150 cars per acre?
150 cars per acre times 80 acres.
- How many?
- 150 times 80.
- 12,000 automobiles.
Well, up in Tallalamee County, they estimated they had 80,000 cars.
What are we going to do with them?
There's much open area around there.
I can probably arrange with other landowners.
There's one adjoining me that has 2,000 acres.
Yes, well, we have some of the adjoining landowners complaining before it's even granted.
If there's 50,000 cars that Mr. Carter can 't park, we're in trouble.
8:38 now at KFRC.
This is Frank Terry, and let me repeat:
The Rolling Stones' free concert is going to be on tomorrow at Altamont Speedway.
Apparently, it's one of the most difficult things to give a free concert.
As you all know, the concert was originally scheduled for Golden Gate Park... and then at the Sears Point Raceway.
Many, many volunteers went out to Sears Point... in trucks, cars, trailers, everything, packed up all the gear out there and took it to the Altamont Speedway... where they are right now, in the cold, 30-degree weather, setting up the stage, setting up the generators... the sound equipment and the facilities for the people.
We're gonna end it now.
Good-bye.
Well, all right!
We got to go!
We got to go!
We got to go!
We got to go!
They hit Mick. Somebody hit him.
- Come on over.
- I hate you!
Keith!
Do you think he'll be coming out?
Oh, Mickey, Mickey,
Mickey, Mickey.
I can't function. I've been on the scaffolding almost all night.
I can't close my hands. They're formed to the shape of the scaffolding.
You people that are hanging on that scaffolding, you're rendering that scaffold unsafe by climbing on it.
Those scaffoldings are not built to take very heavy weight.
So if we could have some sort of reason, whatever that might be, we'd be very pleased.
Arthur, in between moving around, always turn that off.
Turn it off and turn it on.
Look, you've got to be very cool with that little thing.
Even though it's supposed to be electrically correct, man, you got to really think right around it.
Are you gonna hear some music today?
Hey, you want me to just leave this in here?
No.
Hashish.
Hashish.
L.S.D.
Psilocybin.
Hashish.
Make them comfortable.
Even this parking situation back here, it's all wrong, but that's the way the kids park.
For once, we're just gonna let it happen.
For experimental purposes.
You know what I mean?
So be as easy on this as we can.
It won't hurt the Stones in any way.
Wow!
Wow, but I wanna be smart, but you're just so far out.
Because... yeah!
They should be back when they discover we're not with them.
Since we've got the beer and the food, they'll find us.
Well, a guy's freaking out over at the tent there--
So, tough shit.
What do you mean, tough shit?
The guy's really freaking out.
Keep-Keep your--
No, I don't mean tough shit.
What I mean is that... if you lay successive numbers of bums on this crowd, by the time 6:00 comes around, they're gonna be in a real mood.
I'm not prepared to stand here laying bum trips--
Up at Woodstock this was done, and you were there, and you know.
And announcements were made.
We're just sort of getting there, basically.
If we make it.
I've been falling a lot lately.
Let's go this way.
Whoa! When did this happen?
There's already a doctor over there.
A chick's having a baby.
She's having a baby.
Contributions to Panther Defense Fund.
Contributions to the Panther Defense Fund.
They're trying to either wipe out the Panther party... by jailing all the members and wiping them out economically, financially, or violently through killing them.
After all, they're just-- they're just Negroes, you know?
Need that cannon pretty bad.
We just had our first baby born at Carter's Altamont Speedway.
Yeah, right, yes.
- Just had our first baby born.
- Oh, wow.
Okay so far.
Everything's all right.
- We have a helicopter standing by.
- Can we get a mike?
If the press will push this:
Dick Carter's Altamont Speedway, not just Altamont Speedway.
This cat right over here.
He just told me to do it, man.
No, well, I'm sorry.
Nobody else goes there except me.
I'd really like you to get off the stage, baby, please.
Okay, well, I can dig that.
- Thanks very much.
- Uh-huh.
The American Red Cross has asked us to secure these supplies.
If anyone has any of these things to contribute.
We need Ace bandages.
Ace bandages, gauze and sponges.
If you have any of that equipment, please bring it to the medical tent... or to the Golden Gate Chapter
Disaster Service Red Cross truck.
Excuse me.
Which way is the stage?
Around the corner?
You mean that way?
I think we're in pretty good shape, though, right now.
We're in chaos backstage.
We'll never get--
That's gonna have to be cleared,
'cause the group's gotta come in.
What we need to do is start getting some blokes together--
The essence of it, as far as I'm concerned, is this is where the work has gotta go.
- Right.
- Sling them all out.
No fucking about. We've had enough of being polite. Get out, go away.
- I've asked. I know.
- So if you could help us, that would be groovy.
- Sure.
- All these people, you know?
I want to see Mick Jagger, goddamn it. No!
Can I say just one thing before you take her off?
- Just let me say one thing.
- I will not!
Hey, before you go away, man.
Don't tell me what to say, okay?
You look after your job, baby, and I'll look after mine.
You're trying to stop me.
I'm trying to ask you--
Will you ask all these people that are milling around if they'd move to the side, man.
He wants to listen to you.
- You want a bong?
- She wants to get fucked.
That's the way!
You don't belong here, man.
- Let me have some of that.
- I wanna get up on stage.
The organizers, who number about 20 people, would really like to thank the hundreds of people who came out here last night... and worked all night to get this on.
Thanks to everybody who helped.
And I'd like to point out to everybody here... that this can be the greatest party of 1969 that we've had.
Let's have a party, and let's have a good time.
The Flying Burrito Brothers!
Please stop hurting each other.
Please stop hurting each other.
You don't have to.
Take him out the other side!
Take him out the other side!
Hey, man, quit crowding.
Just back off.
We need a doctor under the left-hand scaffold... as soon as possible, please.
They're not gonna play music till we get a doctor.
Somebody help.
Somebody's hurt!
Marianne Faithfull is here.
You feel like signing a few albums?
Let me have that album.
Where's that album?
Thank you.
Well, I'm not stepping outside.
- I don't blame you.
- I am. I want to.
-Just sign this.
- But I can't get very far.
Sign this, please.
Sign this one too.
Hey, what about the free records and all the rest of the shit?
There are a number of people on and around this stage who should not be here.
Consequently-- Consequently, the musicians on this stage... are playing with something like
200 people breathing down their necks.
Now, can I please ask that everyone leaves the stage... and, as I say, we'll go back to playing music and nothing else.
The Jefferson Airplane.
Jefferson Airplane.
Easy!
Easy!
Easy.
Easy. Easy.
Easy. Easy.
Easy.
Please be quiet.
Please be quiet.
Please be quiet.
Please be quiet.
Yeah, it's all right.
It's kind of weird up here.
Hey, man, I'd like to mention that the Hell's Angels... just smashed Marty Balin in the face and knocked him out for a bit.
I'd like to thank you for that.
There's other ways--
Hey, wait. Is this on?
- You're talkin' to me,
I'm gonna talk to you.
- I'm not talking to you.
You're talking to my people.
Let me tell you what's happenin'.
You is what happenin'!
Hey! Oh!
- No! No!
- Watch it. Hold it.
- No, stop it!
- You know what's happening?
- What's happening?
- We're partying like you.
No! No!
Um, you know, that's really stupid.
Hey, man, you guys don't have to stay on the stage.
They're not gonna hassle us.
- Hey.
- They're not really that--
That's really not worth it.
You don't hassle with anybody in particular.
You gotta keep your bodies off each other unless you intend love.
People get weird, and you need people like the Angels to keep people in line.
But the Angels also--
You know, you don't bust people in the head for nothing.
So both sides are, uh, fucking up temporarily.
Let's not keep fuckin' up!
- Oh, that's what the story is here?
- Yeah.
- Oh, bummer.
- Really bad. I mean, like, it's scary.
- Who's doing all the beating?
- Hell's Angels.
- Hell's Angels are beating on musicians?
- Marty got beat up.
- A fight on the stage.
- Doesn't seem right, man.
It's really weird, man.
It's really weird.
- Oh, man! Really?
- There's lots of people.
Get that cleared!
Let's get it!
Oh, babies.
There's so many of you.
Just be cool down in front and don't push around.
Just keep still.
Keep together.
Oh, yeah.
Hey! Hey!
Hey, Keith, Keith, Keith!
Keith, will you cool it, and I'll try and stop it.
Hey, hey, people.
Sisters.
Brothers and sisters.
Brothers and sisters, come on now.
That means everybody just cool out!
Will you cool out, everybody?
- A fight broke out.
- I know. I'm hip.
Everybody be cool now.
Come on.
All right?
How are we doing over there?
All right?
Can we still make it down the front?
Is there anyone there that's hurt? Huh?
Everyone all right?
Okay?
All right, I think we are cool.
We can do--
We're always having--
Something very funny happens when we start that number.
I need to get down with it now.
All right!
Uh, people, who's fighting, what for?
Who's fighting, and what for?
Why are we fighting?
Why are we fighting?
We don't want to fight.
Come on!
Do we want--
Who wants to fight?
Who is it?
Hey, you know, I mean--
Every other scene has been cool. Let--
Look, that guy there, if he doesn't stop it, man--
Listen, either those cats cool it, or we don't play.
- Come on.
- You gonna stop?
We need a doctor!
If you don't cool it, you ain't gonna hear no music!
Now, you wanna all go home or what?
We need doctors down here now, please.
Can we have a doctor down here now to the front?
I-I cannot see what's going on.
I just know that every time... we get to a number, something happens.
I don't know what's going on, who's doing what.
It's just a scuffle.
All I can ask you,
San Francisco, is like the whole thing.
Like, this could be the most beautiful evening... we've had for this winter, you know, and we've really--
Why don't-- Don't fuck it up, man.
Come on, let's get it together.
I can't do any more than just ask you, beg you, just to keep it together.
You can do it.
It's within your power.
Everyone, Hell's Angels, everybody, let's just keep ourselves together.
You know, if we are all one, let's show we're all one.
- Preach it, brother!
- Up on the scaffold. Urgently, man.
There's one thing horrible that we need.
Sam, we need an ambulance.
We need a doctor by that scaffold there.
If there's a doctor, can he get to there?
Okay, here we go. We're gonna--
I don't know what we're doing.
When we get to really the end and we all want to go absolutely crazy, and, like, jump on each other, then we'll stand up again.
You know what I mean?
Everyone keep-- sit down.
I mean, just keep cool, and let's just relax.
Let's just get into the groove.
Come on, we can get it together.
Come on. Sit down.
Hey, man, look. We're splitting.
If those cats can't--
If you people-- We're splitting if those cats don't stop beating everybody up in sight.
I want them out of the way, man.
I don't like you--
A guy's got a gun out here, and he's shooting at the stage.
- It's one guy.
- He's got a gun.
Hey, people.
Hey, people.
Come on, let's be cool.
People, please.
There's no reason to hassle anybody.
Please don't permit it.
If you move back and sit down, we can continue and we will continue.
Can you roll back on that, David?
Sure.
Did you see what was happening there?
No, you couldn't see anything.
Well, it was another scuffle.
There's the Angel right there, with a knife.
- Where's the gun?
- I'll roll it back.
You'll see it against the girl's crocheted dress.
Right there, isn't it?
Oh, it's so horrible.
Is there an officer?
Is there a policeman here?
- What happened here, anyway?
- Man, he pulled out a gun.
- He did?
- Yes, the Hell's Angels took the gun away from him.
One of them has it now.
He showed it to me.
And they proceeded to put him down on the ground and started kicking him.
And he has a couple of stab wounds in his back and one over his ear.
We tried to keep him alive, but when we got here, the doctor checked him out and that was it.
We pronounced him dead at about 6:20.
We have a request from the state police.
- I don't want him to die!
Don't let him die, please!
- He won't die!
Now, they're gonna do everything in their power.
- But they can't hear his heart.
- Now, don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
- They're gonna put him in this whirlybird and take--
- I have to go with him.
Get back, please.
Bye, bye, bye, bye!
Bye, bye, bye, bye!
Oh, yeah!
Come on in!
All right.
See you all.
All right.
Is this thing working?
Are we getting anything?
I can't tell if it's on or not.
It's on now. Thanks.
Folks, you want to listen for a minute, please?
Please, sit down. We don't want to keep repeating these things...
but there are two or three of you assholes out there who don't want to listen.
We're asking you to take your seats.
We cannot begin the show until everyone is seated.
Thanks for your cooperation, we're sorry about the delay.
Rockwell, any sign of him?
God damn it, it's been two-and-a-half hours.
Where the fuck is he?
Sounds like the gunfire at the O.K. Corral out here.
I don't know what's going on.
We may have to get the equipment off.
If he's not here in 15,
I'm putting the group on anyway.
Hold it.
Nanook of the North, let's go buddy.
Let's go, we got a show to do.
Get out of the car. Watch your hands.
- Come on, let's go.
- John Norman, it's me.
You been out shopping, or what?
Let's go, let's clear the stage hall out of here.
You people don't have backstage passes, we're gonna find your asses out!
All of you, get the hell out of here!
Let's go, security.
Where's my security?
You were hired to keep these people out of this damn hall.
If you don't have backstage passes, you get your asses out.
Keep it going for four and a half, then turn the amps on.
Very good, Rockwell.
Little treat here for you, slick.
This will get you set.
I'll be up here.
Are you okay?
Okay, folks,
I thank you for your patience.
Would you welcome please, the John Norman Howard Speedway!
Are you a figment of my imagination...
or am I one of yours?
You guys aren't using the new math on me?
Old logic. Half the people walk out, the other half are comps.
Where was the promotion?
I didn't see any ads.
- Anybody see the ads?
- I don't see the big attraction.
How's it going?
- "Don't be frightened, baby, come on in."
- I can't hear you.
"Don't be frightened, baby, come on in."
- Is that all there is to it?
- That's all there is to it.
That ain't so goddamn much.
I'm sorry, this booze'll blow your brain.
- The refrain, friend!
- What's coming down?
I have temporary amnesia.
No, listen, we did that song 3,726 times.
- We've been waiting five fucking hours!
- Come on!
Yeah, let's go!
- If you feel that way about it...
- Hey, turkey!
...go to hell!
Know what? Go with Nicky.
No, I know them all.
Honey, you get in this car.
We'll sort out who's with who later.
Yeah, go on in, don't worry about it.
- No, baby.
- Security!
Come here. Get these guys.
Come on, John, don't you remember me?
I know an intern who can get you some adrenalin.
I mean, pure adrenalin.
- He rips it off from emergency hospitals.
- Move it.
- 'Cause we need room for the truckers.
- How can I screw up a fella's bass?
- Got to go out for the rain date.
- Tonight was shit.
And it's gonna be shit tomorrow night... if you don't go home and get some shuteye.
Everybody out.
Sweetheart, let me help you out.
If you don't have a key, see me at the desk.
- I can do you, too.
- I got all the adrenalin I need.
- Let's go, Mo.
- Sweetheart, excuse me.
Let's go up to the room, roll one, get a good sleep... get a sound check, and make good music.
- What do you say?
- Not tonight, I can't sleep, man.
- Bobby, let's go boogie.
- Boogie?
Where you going to boogie to?
We've got a gig tomorrow. It's important.
You don't seem to understand, jack.
We had to book four groups in here to get enough people to fill this place up.
Brian gave his word personally that you'd show up straight enough... to remember the words of the damn song, and there's 50,000 people coming... to see if you've still got something to show.
Are you ready?
You horse's ass, it took a court order to get you back on stage.
Don't you understand that?
After Detroit, your ass is on the line.
- I'm not shitting you.
- The hell with it.
- Come on, Mo, let's go.
- Goddamn.
Hey...
- I don't want you to blow this deal.
- Floor it.
Where to?
Back about 10 years.
Yeah, but, what about tonight?
Will you welcome, please, the Oreos.
- Sorry.
- What a thrill.
I want to shake your hand, man.
I mean, I love the way you do it.
- Where you playing? You playing in town?
- No.
- Where you playing now?
- Stop.
Hey, man,
I wouldn't do anything to bug you.
Can I buy you a beer?
This table's reserved.
We got a nice table for you,
Mr. John Norman.
Wine, beer, or herbal tea?
- What?
- Wine, beer, or herbal tea.
- Those are the options?
- Right.
We don't have a license.
So what are you planning to do with that bottle?
I was planning to open it.
You can't do that, we don't have a license.
Wine, beer, or herbal tea.
Do you make herbal iced tea?
- Bring me some herbal iced tea.
- Okay.
- Without the herbal tea.
- Why don't you give me the bottle...
It's stupid.
We don't have a license.
Well, you don't tell, and I won't tell.
- Don't you think you've had enough?
- Of what?
I could lose my job this way.
Well, we don't want that to happen, do we?
Just turn your back.
What you don't know won't hurt you.
Why don't I hold that bottle till you leave?
What are you going to do with my bottle?
Right on.
You're blowing my act.
Okay.
I'm sorry, really I am.
You don't mind, John, just one?
Okay, smile.
Terrific.
Thanks, pal.
John Norman, how you doing?
Shut it, man.
I want a moment of peace.
Son of a bitch!
You ain't going dry while I'm around.
I'm Marty, this is Sheila.
She's a big fan of yours.
I saw you on TV,
I thought you were lousy... but Sheila, she really liked you.
Didn't you, Sheila?
I thought he was okay.
- Let's listen to the song, man, it's great.
- That's shit.
John Norman, why don't you go up there and sing us a song.
I can't, they're working.
Don't tell me about work, superstar.
I work for a living!
- Shut up and let the lady sing.
- Shut up your goddamn self.
She only bought every album you ever made.
She paid for those clothes.
Now get up there and sing her a song!
Not tonight, Sheila.
Just what the hell is that supposed to mean?
It means this drink ain't worth it, friend.
What the hell is going on?
That's a hell of a way to act.
- Okay. Everybody's out!
- He didn't sing for me.
Everybody out.
Pay your checks at the door.
We have to close for the night.
Esther, don't forget your sweater.
See you, guys.
- Through the back.
- Sing for me.
- Wait up.
- He'll sing for you in the car.
- Hey, Mo!
- Look you better get out of here fast!
- I ain't going without you.
- What?
I don't even know you.
I know you, but I don't know you.
Talk to me then.
Let's get inside. It's raining.
- I have to go home. Don't be silly.
- We'll drive you.
- Get in the car. We're getting wet.
- Wait a minute here.
Come on, go on, get out of here.
Just once, I'd like to go someplace without a hassle.
- You're not responsible, right?
- I wish I was invisible.
You can really be invisible in this thing.
Want your bottle back?
- Oh, God, here they come.
- Hit it, Mo, here comes the posse.
Stop driving around here, you shithead.
- Come on back, honey.
- I'll beat you, man.
- Can we go to the car now?
- Fucking star!
What am I doing in here? You're crazy.
You want everything, right?
You're a hell of a singer.
How could you tell?
You were talking through my whole song.
- Not me, that other guy wouldn't shut up.
- So you had to hit him, right?
What was I supposed to do?
Sit there and let him pop me.
All you did was make him a hero.
You gave him a story for the next couple of years. Are you drunk?
Jesus, you talk a lot.
- I always talk a lot when I'm nervous.
- Where are we heading?
Back to the motel.
No, 211 Orchid Street, please.
It's in Hollywood.
Aren't you embarrassed driving around in a thing like this?
Isn't this the kind of car they use for funerals?
- You change the subject a lot.
- What was the subject?
God, you've got incredible eyes.
Do you fish?
Do I what?
- I was trying to tell you how you sing.
- Like a fish?
There's a rush.
There's a little ball of fire inside you whenever you hook into a big marlin.
And you never forget it.
And that's what it felt like... hearing you sing.
That's nice.
That sounded nice.
Check into a motel and call up Bobby.
- Well, thanks for the ride.
- Wait a minute, are you married?
Not anymore, why? Are you?
Oh, Esther, how ridiculous.
You read about it in the entertainment section.
Listen, I'm sorry.
I'm not used to the rich and famous.
It makes me act stupid.
You're acting okay. I ain't done so hot.
Let's start clean.
- You've got a beautiful mouth.
- Even though I talk too much?
You have a great ass.
You live alone?
Terrific.
I wouldn't send up fireworks about it.
- Well, actually, I want to come in.
- Well, actually, no.
Why not?
Listen... if you want to come back for breakfast,
I'll make beaten biscuits.
- I don't eat breakfast.
- Oh, okay, well, good night.
But I will, damn it.
And we'll have beaten breakfast.
Or beaten biscuits.
What time is it? It's got to be 4:00.
- In two hours I'll be back here at 6:00.
- Make it 7:00.
Come on, wake up, it's 6:55.
Don't ever scare me like that again.
Just a minute!
I'll be right there!
Okay.
Hi, it's me.
Breakfast.
- Sausage pizza for breakfast?
- No, it's pepperoni.
- You got the biscuits ready?
- I never made biscuits in my life.
- I was just doing a number on you.
- I know, that's why I brought the pizza.
Got anything to drink?
Anything to drink in here?
You mean like orange juice?
- Trying to improve my character?
- You could use it.
- Hello, brother.
- Where are you?
- Back...
- Beer, wine, anything?
- Now, listen, slick, whatever it is...
- Mo will get us to the airport.
You just save us a place on the chopper.
I'm bringing someone with me.
- What's your name?
- Esther Hoffman.
Hoffman?
Jesus, I love that.
Why?
In the past year, I bet you're the only girl I've met with a last name.
Be there! Are you gonna be there?
You better be there!
- You be there!
- I'll be there, Bobby.
- Just be there, damn it!
- I'll be there.
What went wrong?
- With what?
- It's "with whom."
Your old man.
He put mayonnaise on his liver and onions.
He wouldn't fight.
There you go.
You like a fight.
Less tenderness, more on the wild side.
I can take all the tenderness you got, as a matter of fact.
Eat your breakfast.
- I told you, I don't eat breakfast.
- What are you doing here, then?
I'm picking you up.
There's some raceway, we got a concert.
I'm not that kind of girl.
First we meet through mutual friends, then you call me in a week.
- Then I think about it.
- It's this afternoon.
But you didn't even ask me.
I swear, I got the manners of a hog.
Esther...
- it'd mean a lot to me if you came.
- Okay, I'll come.
Tell me again how you like to be invisible.
- Esther Hoffman.
- How do you do?
Bless your heart!
Let's go.
- All right, this is me getting up.
- Are the people following?
This is what I hired you for,
God damn it.
I'm sorry. Get that off.
Here they are.
Esther, that's good. I'm Gary Danziger.
John Norman's PR man.
Bobby told me about you.
This is Pumpkin, everybody.
Rolling in to it.
Is your last name Pie?
It's all right!
Let's get crazy down in the first row.
Where's Rockwell?
Let's go.
Over here.
John. There you are.
How is it?
Smell the monsters in there.
Okay, folks, good things are certainly worth waiting for.
Would you welcome
John Norman Howard Speedway!
Are you a figment of my imagination, or am I one of yours?
Come on out and see how it feels in the lights.
No!
- There aren't any lights!
- You want lights? Give her lights!
John, the audience is gonna walk out.
Anyway, the sun's out.
Strike the sun and give her a pink spot.
You are crazy, you better go back there.
They are gonna get mad at you.
Go back on the stage!
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm going with her, Bob, is that okay?
- Oh, man, you're beautiful.
- You're crazy.
I love what you do.
Can't say much for your kissing but I love your bike.
It's yours, man. I mean it, it's yours.
- You got to be kidding.
- Come on, John.
Get back on the stage.
You're gonna kill yourself!
Just giving them what they want.
Stop him.
Get off that motorcycle.
Get off that goddamn motorcycle.
- Rockwell, get me an ambulance!
- Okay, folks, he's all right.
Believe me, he is okay.
Please move away from the scene.
If anyone's hurt, go to the medical aid station.
Please move back, let the stretcher through right in front here.
Let the stretcher through, please.
Please move back from the front of the stage.
Everything will be okay.
That's the third time he's done that.
Move it.
Wait up!
This time, only 17 people were hurt.
Sweetheart, listen to me, Brian is trying to turn this disaster into a plus.
Yeah, dignity. We give it dignity.
We plant a story with Time,
The New York Times.
- Not just the rock creeps.
- Good idea.
How about something simple, like "nobody was killed"?
I'm with John Norman Howard, what's doing?
Portside, that's where the action is.
- Bloody Mary.
- You go by her house?
Who's that?
- Esther.
- Yes, she wasn't home.
Son of a bitch. Why won't she call me?
What is all this fuss about this girl?
Maybe she just doesn't like your style.
When Brian says he's canceling the tour... he does not mean it in a pejorative or punitive way, sweetheart.
- It'll be John Norman's decision.
- I don't have all day.
- Let's move it.
- What? Cancel what out?
The tour's a disaster and the promoters won't take that kind of shit.
Late starts and the legal hassles, damage to the halls.
Somebody has to be realistic. Yes?
$27,000 deducted for vodka,
$11,000 for orange juice.
The man likes screwdrivers.
Why don't you go and get laid, it's been almost three hours.
- Then there's the tax lean.
- We've got 50% going out to taxes.
By the time he pays his agent's fees, business management, expenses, dues...
What does the government want from him?
Come on, John.
You're getting to be a cosmic joke.
Come on, enough is enough.
John, I've had inexhaustible patience.
Come on, man, I've kept my temper.
I've left you alone to do as you please.
Now you've got to help.
I can put you into the Indian Relief
Benefit, if you get there on time.
The promoters don't give a shit.
They'll put you in anything, if they can make a buck.
- Who the hell is that?
- John Norman Howard...
an oldie but a goodie on KLAX.
Hey, John Norman...
- Wait a minute, Bebe Jesus.
- Bebe Jesus.
Hey, big John, why don't you come down and rap with us, man...
on our All-time Top 40 weekend?
Three of which are John Norman Howard's.
Platinum Planet played by Bebe Jesus!
50,000 watts of KLAX power, man.
- John Norman, up here.
- John!
Don't shoot, big John.
Hey, man, we're on your side, man.
Don't do it!
See that?
You crazy bastard.
48 straight hit-making hours and not once am I gonna mention your name.
Shit face!
Very funny, Howard.
Hello, police?
I need to report a sniper.
A sniper.
That's an unknown person who fires a gun.
God damn it,
I don't know how many shots he fired.
He just fired at us. That's all.
I'm Bobby Ritchie.
John Norman Howard's road manager.
I love it here in Hollywood, it's so much fun.
Honey.
- You, the one on the right.
- Which one?
The kinky-headed one. Yeah, you.
You're too strong anyway, pull it down some.
- Okay, listen, one more time, okay?
- Okay.
I know it's funny, but we need the money.
- Take 7.
- We got the first part, let's do a pick up.
Girls, we've already got the first part, so let's just pick it up from:
- "Kittens have to chew."
- Okay.
- It's "Love to chew."
- "Love to chew."
"That kittens love to chew."
"That kittens love to chew."
- Right. Yes, sir.
- Got it, all right.
Rolling.
Meow Chow cat food commercial, Take 7.
I'm hungry.
This is terrible, you can't...
How do you think the old cats feel?
Forget about that. Just get rid of her.
Okay, girls, Take 10.
Try to pull yourselves together.
- Okay.
- We don't have time for this.
Get rid of her.
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- I always crack up when I'm sad.
Okay, girls, thank you. That's it.
I'm sorry.
I'm allergic to cats anyway.
- See you later.
- Okay.
I got a phone in here.
I can have a cop in here in a minute.
I'm sorry.
Who gives a rat's ass?
You took a shot at me, man.
My lawyers are talking about it.
Okay. What the hell is it?
KLAX with Bebe Jesus.
You'll never guess who just walked in here...
with his hat in his hand.
I'm not even going to mention his name on the air.
But his lawyers told him he better get on the right side of Bebe Jesus...
because Bebe don't take no jive...
from no burned-out superstar.
- Who needs him?
- I said I'm sorry.
Oh, he says he's sorry.
Can't bite no more, but he still can lick.
Why don't you take this... shit, or whatever it is, out of my office.
Because I don't take nothing from you.
I don't take your bribe.
And I'll tell you why...
because you are a rude...
joyless, burned-out...
spoiled pain in the ass!
And we're bored by you.
Stop that son of a bitch!
Get a cop down here, man.
This fucker's crazy, get a cop down here!
You son of a bitch! Fucker!
Send the bill to my business manager.
He'll lose his money.
Came in the studio and went berserk.
He never had a woman he didn't send away screaming.
Who told you that?
Nobody told me. I read it at the check stand at the supermarket.
But he's cute.
Look, guys, I'll see you later, okay?
- There he is.
- Speak of the devil.
- Excuse me.
- Where did you go?
Everywhere you go fighting breaks out and things get broken.
Have you noticed that?
I called you eight times.
How come you never called me back?
- Excuse me.
- How come you never called me back?
I tried three times.
The fourth time,
I got a disconnected number.
What do you mean?
Oh, Jesus! Hey, what's the date?
Oh, God.
They change my phone every six weeks, because I get all these whacko calls.
Listen, I'm really glad you're okay.
And I'd like to wish you lots of luck, because you'll need it.
Wait a minute.
It'll never work.
I'm a non-violent person.
- We got so many things to talk about.
- I don't think so.
Yeah, we do. I need to know some things.
I don't even know your Social Security number.
You could've reached me if you'd wanted to. I'm real easy to reach.
All you got to do is call my public relations man... he calls my agent, my agent calls my business manager... who calls my personal manager, he calls the secretary... who makes a list and gives it to me in a green folder every other Tuesday.
- Which you never open.
- Which I give unopened to my PR man.
To handle.
- It's my birthday today.
- What?
It's my birthday. I can't handle it.
Let's run away.
Or meet my mother, or marry me.
Sure, maybe when you need a tambourine
I get to shake it.
Maybe.
Esther...
I want you.
I don't want to lose you again.
Is today really your birthday?
You just changed the subject again.
Where's the hearse?
Come on.
I bought it because it looked so much like you.
- What do you mean?
- Fast and out of my league.
One of the privileges of wealth?
- Calm them down.
- I ain't getting out.
Hold them, Mo.
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?
Can't you guys be more friendly?
Don't be afraid.
Come on, boys, we got company.
See how they listen to me?
Don't be scared, they're harmless.
You like living like this?
Like what?
How many rooms are you crammed into here?
I don't know exactly.
This is a funny place.
Yeah, I haven't got it all together yet.
Wow!
What are you planning here?
A skating rink, or what?
It's going to be a studio.
This is wild.
You can throw your own block party, indoors.
We're going to record here.
If we ever get the acoustics right.
Well, as long as you're having fun in it.
Otherwise, I'd get rid of it.
Yeah, that's what I'd do.
They tell me it's an investment.
When you want to eat, you order in some deli?
Chinese takeout, mostly.
- Are you an alcoholic?
- Probably.
You could have used some vocational guidance.
Well, what did I do wrong?
You're living in a million-dollar slum.
Why do you do that?
What were you, rich or poor?
You're cute.
You are fucking cute.
Who are you, Esther Hoffman?
Where did you come from?
There are so many rooms here.
This is a great house for people who never want to see each other.
Come on, I'll give you a tour.
Where are the phones? No phones?
There's one out by the pool, when I need it.
I just happen to love it when the phone rings.
You won't love it, when it wakes you up at 4:00 in the morning.
Somebody you never heard of is calling to tell you he's full of Quaaludes... and he's got a gun... and you're the only person in the world who can tell him... why he shouldn't use it.
Aren't you going to cross my "T"?
How clumsy of me.
Why do they call you?
They love my music.
They think I got all the answers.
You mean, you don't?
I don't even understand the questions.
- Who cleans up around here?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- My manager takes care of it.
I'm always on a plane somewhere.
Too many takeoffs, too many landings... too many places I didn't want to go.
I've been on too many planes.
I've only been on two.
Wait a minute, is a helicopter a plane?
I got to teach you everything.
Been on two planes and you think you got the answer to... for anyone who calls you up.
How many names have you painted around this house?
One.
Jesus, that's pretty. What is it?
Just a little piece I wrote.
I keep hoping it'll be a sonata when it grows up.
Make a hell of a song.
I can't imagine that. It goes so high, nobody could ever sing it.
Play it again.
Just like you done it before.
- Real sweet.
- Okay.
With them little allegros or whatever.
Arpeggios. Okay.
I'm sorry. That was so good!
- Don't quit.
- I got so lost in what you were doing...
- I forgot my own song. Can we continue?
- Yeah.
- Pick it up, right where you were.
- Okay. Right where I was going.
Okay, ready?
No.
We got to get past that word or you'll never forgive me.
Come on, it gets prettier.
I really did forget my song.
Wait. Ready, get set, go.
- It's a pretty song. Family hour.
- Ready? Here we go.
God, that's wonderful.
It's your song.
Is that inside your head?
- You're so pretty.
- Oh, kiss my ass.
- Let's do it again.
- I'm tired.
Come on.
You want to make me into a machine?
- I want to make you a perfectionist.
- I already am a perfectionist.
Running in and picking up the bathmat after every shower I take doesn't count.
- You noticed that?
- Do it.
Wait. Again.
Wait a minute. Again.
Now that's closer.
You got a little righteous anger into it.
You reckon you can handle two lines?
I reckon I can try.
Well, then, play it for me.
I also wash out your hairbrush.
Just what am I supposed to tell Brian?
You're standing here, your album is three months overdue.
They got a beef and it's legitimate.
Listen, they said your tour was shit... you're handing in old stuff you rejected...
Turn that down a minute.
Yet you rejected from old albums.
Where's your new stuff?
And now you're recording a chick.
She's great.
I know she's great, I love her, man.
But if you're going to record her, record her right.
Get her with somebody who can complement her.
I don't think it's Speedway.
I wanted something to show somebody, and I got who I know.
Shit, Bobby, these guys are as good as you can get.
Slick, don't pull that shit with me.
I know who they are,
I know how good they are... and what they got that is special.
John Norman?
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
- Certainly.
- How are you doing, baby?
- Look... you know I'm grateful and all that, right?
- And they're fantastic musicians, but...
- What's wrong?
It's just not like what's in my head.
- How do you hear it?
- They have these guitar things going...
I love it. I love this part, don't you?
And the piano also is going like this...
You know? Like chords like that.
Instead of...
What I hear is a kind of rolling thing.
- Classical? Like classical?
- Yeah.
It's your move.
This one's on you, slick.
I feel embarrassed,
I don't know how to tell them.
Well, you're exactly right.
- And I'll tell them.
- Oh, great.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, John.
I'm not bad for him.
- Well, he ain't working.
- Man, that was great.
He can pass a day without being drunk and can sleep without downers.
- So we're gonna try it again tomorrow.
- He ain't working, Esther. Rock and roll.
It's your dime.
- So tomorrow we record it as she wants it.
- God damn it, women.
Okay.
We're really happy to have with us for the American Indian Relief Fund...
the star of our show, the John Norman Howard Speedway!
Are you a figment of my imagination, or am I one of yours?
Get ready for anything now.
Wait, hear me out. At ease.
Now wait a minute, you just think you want to hear that same old shit.
This being a benefit, hold it, for a good cause...
and just by being here you all deserve more than you're getting...
so, we're fixed to do you all a favor.
Hold it.
Me and the boys stumbled onto something real...
a little while back.
It's so good. That's right.
That crazy son of a bitch.
This may have something to do with you.
Me? What are you talking about?
Well, keep it up, man.
You got the corner on the ignorance market!
What's going on?
- What are you doing, you bastard?
- Trust me.
- Why should I trust you?
- Let's go.
- Why not?
- Oh, shut up.
I am not prepared. What are you doing?
You just recorded 10 songs with these guys.
Motherfucker.
- Charm them.
- What am I going to sing?
All right, that's real good.
We've seen your act, now shut the fuck up.
Give the lady a chance, all right?
A friend of mine...
Esther Hoffman.
- Why don't you do Woman in the Moon?
- Okay.
I love you.
Great. You got some more to do.
No. Really.
Promise you won't go away?
You stay right here.
- Hold on, you don't wanna leave.
- Where is John?
I remember you,
I'm sure you don't remember me.
- I remember you. How's your pumpkin?
- That's good!
- I want you to meet some people.
- There she is!
Esther!
Hello, I'm Freddie Lowenstein.
- The JS's agent.
- You were awesome.
Thank you.
- I want you to meet Brian Wexler.
- That was extraordinary.
- John Norman's manager.
- How do you do?
Very nice to meet you.
Did you see John Norman?
Where is John Norman?
I'll get John Norman for you.
- I'll get him.
- Please get him for me.
No, this ain't gonna happen now.
I'll get back to you.
We'll send a bio in the morning, you hear me?
- Would you get him and bring back to me?
- Yes.
You handle this here.
Anything else you need?
Hey, just a second.
Turn off this light!
Esther, I want you to meet
Ricky Vingo, K3SC, Seattle.
Let's take it easy, all right?
- What name are you performing under?
- Wait a minute.
What?
- Ever think of changing the name?
- Why would I do that?
I'd need a new driver's license, stationery, Social Security number.
It really would be a bother.
Excuse me. Please. Excuse me.
- Esther, we love you.
- You are beautiful.
Out of the way!
Esther, you're dynamite, but get rid of the creep.
What just happened?
You did it! It's all yours, baby!
Everything you want.
Your own personal piece of the American dream.
It's not everything I want.
You know what I want?
You know what it means, don't you?
You're gonna be on the road.
That's every cliché you ever heard about it.
You got your junk food and your jailhouse tan.
Lots of crazy strangers.
It's a full-tilt boogie, from motel to motel.
I want to marry you.
You got your basic meeting with your basic mayor... you got the basic keys to the city, only you don't know what city you're in.
I want to marry you.
No, you don't.
I drink too much, I throw my money away.
I owe the government $180,000.
- Don't you want to?
- That's not the point.
So do I, so we should do it together.
I never thought I'd get married again.
You'd be lucky to have me.
It's not my luck I'm worried about.
Shut up! We're talking here!
I want you.
What do you know what you want?
You been on two planes...
I really do want you, Johnny.
Don't bullshit me, Esther.
I might start believing you.
John Norman Howard, do you take this woman as your husband... wife?
Excuse me.
John Norman Howard, do you take this woman as your wife?
I do.
Esther Leona Hoffman, do you take this man as your husband?
Wait a minute. No. That's it?
That can't be. It's too short.
What about the "love, honor...
"and obey till death do us part" part?
Honey, this is what they tell us to say.
If you want the long form you have to do it in church.
Anyway, "obey" is out, the dawn of a new century.
- Say "cherish," it's friendlier.
- That's okay.
I'm already stretching this, doing it out here instead of in my office.
Are you gonna do it, or not?
I'm gonna do it.
Me, too.
- Me, too.
- Good.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
- That's so funny.
- It's strange.
All the people are looking.
We're married, stop that.
This is a sample gift, courtesy of the city.
Let's get out of here before we get arrested!
I can't believe it!
What is this, a box of candy?
Pre-moistened handy wipes... fabric softener, stain remover... strawberry douche?
- Everything for a perfect marriage kit!
- Strawberry douche?
Unless you prefer apricot.
Over there?
Wait.
How much further is it?
We are on it.
- This is your farm?
- Ranch, Esther.
This is your average 88,000-acre, non-working ranch.
You mean as far as I can see, you own it?
You and I own it, babe, community property.
You and I, and the First National Bank of Tucson... and the Bankers Trust in Phoenix.
Brian's got a second mortgage in there somewhere.
I bet he does.
Outright, I think, you and I own maybe a quarter of an acre.
That's plenty.
Look at the clouds.
- Where's your ranch house?
- This is it.
What do you mean, "this is it"?
- This is it.
- Where?
Hold it, let's do it right.
This is getting to be a habit.
I kind of like it.
- This is the stone entrance way.
- Stone?
Careful of those five steps.
Thanks for telling me.
- You're in the kitchen.
- The kitchen?
- I thought you lived here.
- I do.
It's just not finished yet.
- How come you never finished it?
- I guess I never had a reason to.
What do you think of it?
It's beautiful.
- Where's the bedroom?
- You're standing in it.
How convenient to put a kitchen in the bedroom.
Watch out. Wait a minute,
I'll get a blanket.
You're gonna get stickers in your ass.
I don't care.
That's the spirit that built the West!
Great place.
We don't even have any floors yet!
Look at this. Isn't that beautiful?
Stop, don't!
It's in my ear!
I can't hear anything.
I'm so sorry.
- I'm drowning! You have to do first aid.
- Quick, aid, medic!
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
I'm drowning, honey.
I want you to always do what you want, okay?
You're so cute. You're fucking cute!
Esther, I'm not cute.
I've told you not to call me cute.
You are cute.
You sure like whipped cream.
Tastes much better that way, doesn't it?
I love to watch you eat.
I never seen anything like it.
You put your whole heart and soul, and back, and everything else into it.
You just like me, don't you?
Well, yes!
Look what Brian gave us...
- for a wedding present.
- What did Brian get us?
It appears to be...
Look at this. We can do our whole tour in trash-flash.
I'll get you a matching sequined guitar strap.
Your tour, baby, not ours.
A genuine, leather-bound, hand-illustrated...
sixteenth-century edition of the Kamasutra.
We could have used a toaster.
What's that?
- Who would send us an empty bottle?
- Me.
You like this? Look at this!
How would this look?
It'll never work under the lights.
I'm not gonna plan my life around the lights.
You are right now.
You haven't earned the right not to yet.
Crap! You know how I hate that attitude.
You can tell me how to do it and you won't do it yourself.
I do not like this anymore than you do.
Please do it with me.
Please do the tour with me.
It would mean so much to me.
You're a charmer... and you got a sweet little ass, but I ain't going to.
Either you do this tour with me, or, God damn it, I won't do it.
I'll stay home and bake bread.
We'll get fat and our teeth will fall out.
That would be just great.
Because you're so good in the kitchen.
Fucker.
For God's sake.
Love and cherish?
How are you going to cherish me in traction, you dumb bastard?
Get yourself paralyzed from the neck down... how you gonna think we are ever gonna have a baby? Stop it!
What are you doing?
Stop!
John Norman!
You son of a bitch!
What did you do that to me for?
I thought you were dead!
I'm too pretty to die!
You pervert!
Bullshit, what's wrong with you?
You only feel alive when you're scaring yourself half to death?
Who was scared?
You were scared, I wasn't scared.
You're such an asshole sometimes.
Honestly!
- Quit that.
- You knew that all the time.
Life is so lousy with me, you want to leave it?
Hold still!
No, I will not, I don't like hairy men!
Look what you did to me!
Then off it goes. How clumsy of me.
- Off what goes?
- The beard, I'll cut it off!
- What are you going to do?
- Cut her off.
What do you mean? Cut what off?
Come on back.
You just keep wondering about it.
Stop being like a nut!
What are you going to do now?
How are you going to top that one?
You're crazy, you're a damn fool.
Stop it!
Come on, how would I recognize you?
I don't know what you would look like.
I might be very superficial and not even like you anymore.
Don't scare me anymore, Johnny.
Just hold me.
If you ever die, I'll kill you.
I ain't never going to die.
- Promise?
- Yeah, I promise.
- Hell, I'll go on your goddamn tour.
- Really?
I love you!
Do you realize how long it's been since you've seen anybody but me?
Yeah, and I love it.
It gives the day a focus.
I wake up looking at you.
I go to sleep looking at you.
It's simple and I can handle it.
Oh, no!
Shit.
God!
Esther looks great and happy.
I'm happy for her and I'm happy for you.
Brian, what did you bring me out here to say?
You seem like somebody I knew a long time ago.
It's nice.
You don't want me going out on the road with her, right?
John, remember, I'm talking to you as a man who loves you.
Esther's got her own music and her own public.
They want her, you they're suing.
She shouldn't have to pick up on that.
Jeez, don't beat around the bush.
Tell me what you feel about me going out on tour with that lady.
- Can you take it?
- Certainly I can take it.
You blew it.
Your songs don't work.
You're causing people a lot of trouble.
- People are getting hurt.
- I was wrong...
Her single's Number 6 with a bullet.
She's up for a Grammy, she's ready to fly on her own.
Let her go, John.
Think you're telling me something I don't know?
I've been trying to tell her that.
I know our music doesn't even belong on the same stage... but she doesn't want to do it on her own.
Maybe you could produce her tour.
I can't even keep a bank account, man.
You might enjoy it.
Me and the boys are getting back together.
We got some new stuff.
Better than anything you ever heard.
You're gonna love it.
John, about Esther...
All right. I will tell her.
Don't worry about it, Brian.
- Great!
- I don't want to laugh.
Don't laugh. That's great!
Serious? Perfect.
- Then what?
- Do seedy.
Now I'm in trouble.
Esther sings.
I'm tired, can I get off this bar stool?
- Sure, give me a chance to reload.
- Just take a little break.
- How are you doing down there?
- Fine.
Freddie? I want you to come outside and look at this goddamn view.
I already saw it, thanks a lot.
Out here, Freddie.
You won't believe it, come.
- Like it?
- I love it!
I got a terrific idea for the middle of the set!
I was gonna talk to you about that.
Sorry I'm taking so long, Esther...
I was gonna have an assistant, but I was afraid it'd spoil the mood.
You changed your mind.
When I photograph someone for the first time, it's got to be perfect.
- You're not gonna do the tour.
- I've been thinking a lot about that...
I think it's right that you should go out and do it by yourself.
If I'm on a bill...
- they can say I'm carrying you.
- Since when do you care what people say?
I care what they say about you.
Esther, relax. Your face, my God, this light is fantastic.
I don't want do it alone.
I am scared of going public.
You're already gone, babe.
Esther.
Beautiful.
What do you think about the reviews on your new album?
- I haven't read them.
- They're selling like crazy.
I heard some are good... my manager tells me some are terrible,
I don't really care.
I don't go into a studio and say I'm gonna cut a hit record.
I just cut songs I like.
She's able to handle it pretty good.
Better than I would.
Johnny, I wish I could go with you.
When you finish your TV thing, you can come on the road with us.
Listen, darling, you've never heard the Speedway when we're really cooking.
- You're gonna be proud of me.
- I am proud of you already, Johnny.
What am I gonna do without you for six whole hours?
I'll write you.
Okay, I got to go.
Okay.
Give the guys a hug for me.
I miss you already.
- Esther.
- What?
- What's the matter?
- I was just taking another look.
You're crazy.
It's Amelia Earhart.
What's all this?
Did you hear any of that?
- What is it?
- That's Freeway.
That's your new album, it's gonna be released in three weeks.
We're still cutting basic tracks.
Nothing changes but the changes, slick.
Freeway?
Last I heard it was the Speedway.
Then I guess you haven't heard.
They're the hottest thing since Tabasco.
When did all this happen?
Survival.
We thought you retired, slick.
Now that the old lady's working... can't expect these guys to sit around while you're out lollygagging... in the desert with Esther.
They got a single chasing up the charts right now, Number 5 with a bullet.
Don't you ever listen to your radio?
I had my radio turned off for about a minute.
Gotta get some more of that.
- Come on outside with me.
- Bring that up, Lou.
Is your old lady on the road, or what?
She had to stop the tour for that television thing.
You're not gonna believe this.
All the way over here, I've been trying to think how I was gonna tell you all...
- about this thing I got to do.
- What? Tell me.
But it's perfect now.
They want me to go out on the road.
They want me alone, without Speedway... with some new material. It's good.
But it's different.
It's a different sound, you see.
I have been working... with these couple of young punks I found... in a club out there in some canyon, and they're hungry... and they love my stuff, man, and it's exciting.
That's good, I'm glad.
What time is it anyway, man?
I don't know... Come in here a minute.
- Got a rehearsal.
- No. Come on.
I can't do it. Would you tell them
I like what they are doing?
- I love you, brother.
- And I love you, man.
Can somebody pick that up out there?
Hello?
Yes, this is 652-1652.
No, she isn't in here now.
No, this isn't her secretary.
No, this isn't her answering service.
Yeah, bye.
God damn it!
Pick up the phone out there!
Hoffman residence.
No, she isn't here yet.
All right, I'll tell her. Yes.
John Norman?
Over here.
Hi!
How did it go?
God, it's dark in here.
How can you work in the dark?
Tell me. I can't wait to hear.
What happened with the guys?
Do you know when you are going out with them?
I'll be your groupie, if you'll be mine.
- Did you play your stuff for them?
- No.
Why not?
I don't even know where their heads are right now.
They're into something new that I can't get next to.
I hope they know what the hell they are doing.
You're not gonna go on tour with them?
I don't want to talk about that crap,
I want to talk about you.
How did it go today?
They hire me and they want to change everything about me.
I'm too short for the costumes,
I'm too tall for the men...
I'm too loud for the songs, too quiet for the jokes.
I don't know what they want.
You just stick to your guns.
I'm sticking with you.
- You tired?
- Yeah. I'm starving.
So am I. I want some beer and a pickle.
I want some oysters and Greek olives.
Let's have a picnic in bed.
Good idea.
I'll bring up some peanut butter and jelly and unfiltered honey.
God damn it!
- Forget it. Just don't answer it.
- It's probably for you.
I don't care, just let it ring, maybe they'll go away.
Which reminds me. Jameson wants you to do an interview show on the 12th.
You've a wardrobe fitting and an insurance examination on the day after tomorrow.
Johnny, I don't want to talk about it now.
Let me finish it before I forget.
You gotta have...
They want to know how many places you want at the... table at the Grammy Awards.
And two hang ups.
Who said that the booze and the dope would ruin your brain?
Your memory ain't your liver anyway, is it?
I'm gonna make a drink, you want some?
What happened today, Johnny?
Why don't we talk about it?
Johnny?
And now to present this year's Grammy Award...
for the Best Performance by a Female Artist...
here are Rita Coolidge and Tony Orlando!
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!
This is the year where the have-nots, once again, give to the haves.
The winner is going to have to fight me off to get this.
Spoons, forks, guns, knives, it makes no difference.
Yes, indeed.
In fact, I wonder who the lucky person is.
I hope they don't outweigh me.
You're a shoo-in.
Brian, I gotta leave.
He's probably stuck in traffic.
Bullshit, you know better.
He probably forgot. I got to go find him.
The winner for the Best Performance by a Female Artist is Esther Hoffman!
Thank you.
I tell you, this one caught me by surprise...
I really didn't plan on winning it...
but I did prepare a little something, just in case, you know?
The problem is I wrote it on the tablecloth over there.
So you're gonna have to read it to me or something.
No, to make this as brief as possible...
there are two people that I would really like to thank.
Table six.
The first one is Abraham Burakovski, who...
What do you say, let's go outside, get some air.
Let go of my goddamn arm.
Let go of my arm.
Christ! I'm sorry, baby,
I can't find my place.
They don't seem to have a place for me down here.
The second one is here with us tonight.
John Norman Howard.
Don't do that.
Not to me anyway.
At least don't do it to me.
You did something all by yourself and it was good.
You don't owe anybody a goddamn thing for that, not me, and certainly not them.
You don't have to thank them... for the privilege of giving them something good.
I missed you all day, baby.
You're blowing your act.
I'm blowing whose act?
Good night, everyone, thank you.
Wait, you forgot your thing...
for best performance.
Which is what it's all about, ain't it?
What about the one you got for the worst performance?
You all know I deserve it.
And, God knows, I couldn't have done it without you.
Get him off the stage.
Anyway, I work hard for it, and I want it!
So where the fuck is it?
Let me see the worst thing you got to offer...
for the worst I got to offer!
You know, I'd really like to rub salt in your ass?
The Grammy Awards will continue after this commercial message.
Who the hell is Burakovski?
I'm okay!
...managed to upstage his Grammy
Award-winning wife, Esther Hoffman.
You're an ass!
Keep the lights on them!
Out of the way!
Keep them in the shot. Go. Follow them.
Put the lights on it.
Get a shot of that.
We're catching all the action for you!
Mr. Jesus Christ Superstar just belted out his new champion.
Tarzan, how does it feel to uncork on the old lady?
Johnny!
You see it?
What are you doing?
He's trying to kill me!
Stop it.
Shut off your goddamn lights!
When is it ever enough?
Don't you ever have enough?
What are you gonna do for an encore, set yourself on fire?
What is it?
Don't you know how good you are?
What is it? Is it me?
Am I doing something wrong?
I love you, Johnny.
But it's not enough, is it?
I'm sorry, I can't...
This is ridiculous.
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Can you hold the playback, please?
I can't walk when I'm singing down the steps. I mean, I'll kill myself.
Could you please stop the playback?
In rehearsal, we...
In rehearsal there was white tape on the floor...
I guess it was supposed to be the steps... but anyway, actually, it comes in a very important part of my lyric.
Why don't I just stand there and sing the song?
I'm not trying to be difficult or anything,
I'm just trying to get it right.
Hello?
Anybody hear me?
What's wrong?
What's going on down there?
- I don't know, let me check!
- Hi.
Can we take a break, please?
Roll it back, five minutes, everyone!
- Fucking star...
- Your mike's on.
Sorry.
- You want a Valium?
- Not yet.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
How is he?
The same. I fly out to him on weekends.
And he pretends that it is okay, you know, for a day or so.
Then I pretend I don't notice he's pretending.
- Ms. Hoffman?
- Hoffman.
- That's what I said.
- What?
We have a little problem with your reflection.
We'll deal with it in a moment.
- All right.
- I will be with you shortly.
I just can't do it anymore,
Brian. I just...
I get on a plane,
I lock myself in the bathroom... and I scream all the way from Tucson to L.A.
Sometimes, I look at him when he's sleeping... and he...
He has no pain in his face, no hurt.
He's so beautiful.
Can we see wardrobe in the booth, right away, please?
And I wish I could just... wake him up and have him stay that way.
Calm, peaceful.
He's been writing songs, you know.
- Has he talked to you about them?
- No, he doesn't call me.
Why don't you call him for Christ's sake, what are you waiting for?
You're supposed to be his oldest friend.
What is it?
We have to check your light reflection.
- When I finish talking to Mr. Wexler...
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- Okay, thank you.
He is my oldest friend.
He made me rich, turned my life around,
I can't do any more for him.
That sucks, Brian.
There's a lot you can do for him.
You can give him your time.
You can give him your support, you can earn your 25%...
Let's not justify this.
I am as good a friend as you are.
I am not in love with him.
I don't have to believe something that's not true...
Don't say that, don't...
- Don't say that, Brian.
- We're ready, Ms. Hoffman.
These songs... that he's writing are really good.
I mean, they're not what... you're used to hearing but they're really...
- fine.
- Well... let me go listen to them... let me hear them, and we'll see.
We'll see.
It makes me angry that I have to pitch you like this... that I have to sell you, make you go.
- Come on.
- Why not go?
You don't have to pitch me, sell me, or ask me.
I'll go. If they're good...
I'll record them.
I will record them, okay?
Okay.
I would appreciate that, Brian.
We're all waiting, Ms. Hoffman.
Thank you, John.
I like the songs.
You do?
Yeah.
Bull squash, Brian.
You got a different sound there, John, a different sound altogether.
I think we gotta give them some of your golden oldies.
Stuff that made you a household word.
I'll fix it, no favors.
I'll make a mint.
You're new stuff is good,
I'll record it if you want.
But I don't think they'll buy what they don't know.
I appreciate what you're doing... but you can't have them songs anyway.
I want them.
- I wanna start my own label.
- That's good.
I'm getting too damn old for this road... and I wanna be a mogul like you.
Live off everybody else.
Who are you?
Quentin.
Remember?
I used to be with Gary Danziger.
Oh, that Quentin.
How did you get in?
I came in with the pool man.
Guess how long I've had this.
Since Gary Danziger, I bet.
I was with him for a week.
It was a meaningful relationship.
Listen, you could help me out.
How about the same way you got in?
Listen, I'd like an interview.
I string for Rolling Stone and all the pop magazines.
An exclusive interview.
I bet you would.
This is far out.
Out of sight!
Blows the mind.
Boy, you really have a way with words.
I can't wait to see what you write.
Please.
I'd do anything for this interview.
You can ask Gary what I'd do.
I'm sure he'd tell me.
Gary says I'm terrific.
He really gets off on me.
Gary's been known to say things like that.
I'd really like this interview.
Far out.
Exclusive.
Out of sight.
With Esther.
Perfect.
He's home!
Fantastic.
John Norman!
You're back.
She wants an interview with you.
Yeah.
Far out, huh?
I'll get my tape recorder.
This means so much to me.
This is terrific. Give me a minute.
I'll get this tape recorder.
I don't know, this is amazing.
I'm really excited.
Okay, now wait a minute.
Get this tape recorder on here.
Okay.
Go!
What's the matter with her?
Is she gonna talk to me, or what?
I did my part.
You dirty son of a bitch!
All right, get out.
- What do you mean, get out?
- I mean, get out!
The hell with you, man.
Listen... he couldn't make it anyway.
Put it in the interview.
Don't leave anything out.
I said, get out!
I've had it with you.
You can trash your life, but you're not gonna trash mine.
Esther, for Christ's sake!
Esther, for God's sake.
God damn it, you're gonna hurt yourself.
You stupid bastard!
I won't let you humiliate me.
Fight!
Fight, you bastard!
Protect yourself.
I'll kill you.
I tried to tell you.
It's no good with me.
It was good.
You stupid...
Until you blew it.
With her?
You're crazy. She's nothing.
Don't insult me.
She has nothing to do with it.
- Esther.
- Would you shut up?
What are you trying to do, make me hate you?
So long. I'll let you go.
Oh, God, how corny.
- Esther, listen...
- Shut up, don't try to say anything to me.
I have to think.
- Baby...
- Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
I don't like you anymore.
Where the hell are you running to now, you fucking coward?
I don't wanna do this to you anymore.
Then fight for me, God damn it... because if you keep walking...
I'll hate you.
And I'll hate you forever.
I love you, Esther.
Well, I hate you.
I love you.
I hate you.
- I love you.
- I hate you.
I love you.
Johnny, I'm so happy we're going out together.
Yeah.
God, how great, no phones.
Did you call Brian about the tour?
No, not yet.
I figured I'll tell him when
I pick him up at the airport tomorrow.
I can't wait to see his face.
I hope it's not too late to change all those ads and the promos.
You know what I want you to do?
I want you to tell me about the road again.
Tell me again.
How's it gonna be? Go ahead.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Remember that thing you told me just the other night.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I'm tired. Tired of words.
About how you weren't gonna let me trash your life.
I don't know what I said,
I don't even remember.
Yeah, well, I do.
I liked the way you said it.
You were right.
Yeah, well, maybe I can teach you something, too.
What I liked about it was that... it sounded like you knew who you were.
I'm Esther Hoffman Howard.
That's right.
And don't you ever forget it.
Where are you going?
I gotta go pick up Brian.
Oh, I forgot.
Just wait a minute, okay?
I'll get dressed, okay?
It's so cold.
I wish you could come back to bed with me.
You go back to sleep, darling.
I'll go get him.
He would have to take an early plane, wouldn't he?
That's Brian.
- You hurry up home now, okay?
- Okay.
I'll have breakfast waiting for you.
Like a good little wife.
What?
Just looking, baby.
I love you.
Hey, boy. Good morning.
Yeah, that's a good dog.
5821 to Adam.
All right, I'm about 14 miles due east...
of the interstate on County 327.
I've got a single-vehicle fatality, no secondary vehicle involvement.
The subject vehicle left the roadway approximately 160 mph.
Crossed the shoulder, impact at 145 feet due east.
No roll bar, no subsequent fire damage.
The deceased will be transported by rescue ambulance.
- 10-4, bye, Victor.
- 10-4, Grace.
- I got it.
- Go on. Get out of here.
You, too, mac.
He needs a blanket.
Could you... Bring him a blanket, okay?
Could you please not stare at him now?
Just...
I'm so scared, Johnny.
I don't know what to do.
Hold me!
Please, hold me!
Gotta move him.
What?
Gotta move him, honey, come on.
No.
- Yes, we gotta move him.
- No.
- Come on.
- No.
No, please, don't.
Be gentle with him, please.
- He'll be all right.
- Don't hurt him.
- Don't hurt him.
- One... two... three.
Come on, let me give you a hand.
Watch your foot there.
- I got it.
- Come on, lady, please.
I told you to get out of here.
You, too, buddy. Enough is enough.
Just one more.
He was like a brother to me.
I don't know what you boobies call him...
but Bebe Jesus calls him one of the greats.
One of the all-time greats.
John Norman Howard.
Can somebody pick that up out there?
Johnny.
- Hello?
- Johnny.
No, this isn't her secretary.
Hey, lady.
How do you turn this thing off?
You're a liar.
You're a liar.
And you're a big talker.
Talk.
What the hell is wrong with you, anyway?
You're selfish, that's what.
Shit!
Oh, God!
You are a very selfish person.
And a liar!
Because you promised me, you son of a bitch, you promised me.
You promised me and you lied.
You lied.
You lied to me!
I'm sorry, Johnny.
It's just that there were so many things
I wanted to tell you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Esther Hoffman Howard.
I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
The year is 1929. The singer,
Cliff Edwards, also known as Ukulele Ike.
The film, Hollywood Revue.
It is the first all-talking...
...all-singing, all-dancing movie ever made.
Everyone from the place
Come on with your rain
I've got a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane
In the years that followed,
"Singin' in the Rain" would become...
...a theme song for MGM.
Singin' in the rain
In the 1930s, Jimmy Durante gave us this rendition.
You wrote that this morning?
Yeah, it's something they'll remember.
Yeah, I remember it already.
I'm singin' in the rain
Oh, I'm singin' in the rain
What a grand, what a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
In the 1940s, Judy Garland did it her way.
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart
I'm gettin' ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
And come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
And singin'
Singin'
I'm singin' in the rain
In the 1950s, Gene Kelly,
Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor...
...put it all together in what many folks would call the best musical ever made.
Singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feelin'
We're happy again
If you're wondering what happened in between, well...
...sit back and relax.
You're about to find out.
It's been quite some time since I first came to this place.
And MGM is certainly not the same studio...
...and Hollywood's not the same town.
But the films we made here are still around.
Some studios can claim they made the finest gangster films...
...or the greatest horror movies...
...but when it came to musicals,
MGM, they were the champions.
Musicals were fantasy trips for the audiences of their day.
For instance, boy meets girl, boy loses girl...
...boy sings a song and gets girl.
The plots were that simple.
The musicals of the 1930s, '40s, or even the '50s...
...may not tell you where our heads were at...
...but they tell you where our hearts were at.
And all of this lovable nonsense began back in 1929...
...when the silent film had suddenly become a thing of the past...
...and sound was the king.
Don't bring a frown to old Broadway
You've gotta clown on Broadway
Broadway Melody of 1929 won an Oscar for the Best Picture that year...
...and MGM was off and running with a new formula for success.
Charles King and a line of slightly overweight chorus girls...
...were the beginning of a new motion picture art form...
...that would captivate audiences for years to come.
No skies of gray
On the Great White Way
That's the Broadway Melody!
No skies of gray
On the Great White Way
That's the Broadway Melody!
Within a few short years, the musical had come of age.
The primitive stage show had now become a cinematic spectacular.
Here Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger,
Nelson Eddy and a cast of thousands...
...watched Eleanor Powell dance in Rosalie.
When I'm calling you
The most successful singing team in the history of motion pictures...
...Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald in Rose-Marie.
Will you answer too?
- Then I will know
- Then I will know
- Our love
- Our love
- Will come true
- Will come true
- You'll belong to me
- You'll belong to me
- I'll belong
- I'll belong
- To you
- To you
In 1936, The Great Ziegfeld won an Oscar for Best Picture that year...
...and it's no wonder.
Virginia Bruce and a gang of lovely ladies...
...cluttered up
Hollywood's biggest staircase.
And somewhere in that lovely mob, you'll find Dennis Morgan singing a song.
If anyone could afford to film this extravagant number today...
...perhaps it would look something like this.
Just like a heavenly rhapsody
She captures you right from the start
Just like a beautiful melody
She'll play on the strings of your heart
A pretty girl
Is like a melody
That haunts you night and day
Just like the strain
Of a haunting refrain
She'll start upon a marathon
And run around your brain
You can't escape
She's in your memory
By morning, night and noon
She will leave you
And then
- Come back again
- Will come back
A pretty girl
Is just like a pretty
Tune
She's in your memory
By morning, night and noon
She will leave you
And then
Come back again
A pretty girl
Is just like a pretty tune
The last of the big black-and-white production numbers...
...starring Eleanor Powell and Fred Astaire.
Cole Porter's music, the sets and the camera work...
...the direction by Norman Taurog, the incredible tap dancing by these two...
...well, it all seemed to come together in Broadway Melody of 1940.
You know, you can wait around and hope, but I'll tell you...
...you'll never see the likes of this again.
Don't be afraid
You'll make the grade
Why, you can sing
As good as Bing
And here, the old pro,
James Durante, gives a newcomer...
...a few pointers in It Happened in Brooklyn.
Sing it, Danny, make me proud.
Okay, Nick, stand back.
It doesn't have to be witty or smart
Smile.
Long as it comes from the heart
Keep going.
It doesn't have to be classic or rock
Great.
Long as it comes from the heart
I'll give 'em that
I'll give 'em this
I'll strut away
Boy! You can't miss!
Just put a star on my chart
You won't need this anymore.
'Cause the song's gonna come
From the heart
Don't work cheap.
- On opening nights
- On opening nights
- Your name in lights
- Your name in lights
Why we won't stop
'Til you reach the top
- We'll order our meal à la carte
- We'll order our meal à la carte
- That's expensive!
- That's expensive!
- If the song comes from the heart
- If the song comes from the heart
We'll be tremendous!
- If the song comes from the heart
- If the song comes from the heart
They'll holler, "Bravo. "
- If the song
- If the song
- Comes from the heart
- Comes from the heart
- Heart
- Heart
That's just a sample of what's been going on around here for the past 40 years.
The work was hard, but it was great fun.
Because the people you worked with really knew what they were doing.
It was said that through those doors passed the most famous stars in Hollywood.
I don't think you'll find anyone around this town who will argue about it.
Here's one of the most lovely and talented of those stars...
...Miss Elizabeth Taylor.
I was 10 years old when I first came to MGM.
And I spent most of the next 18 years of my life...
...behind the walls of that studio.
As a young girl growing up in that strange place...
...it's hard to recall what was real and what wasn't.
Perhaps, my most vivid memories were of MGM musicals.
Just to stand there on the set and watch...
...the singing and the dancing.
It was like fantasy come true.
Total innocence. Loveliness.
I love a melody
Of spring
Lilacs in bloom
Birds on the wing
I made my musical debut when I was 15 years old...
...in a film called Cynthia.
I was certainly no threat to Jane Powell or Judy Garland...
...as you will see.
For life is an eager
Joyous thing
Whenever I hear
The music
Of
Spring
Maybe that experience helped give me...
...the enormous regard that I have for musical talent.
And believe me, at MGM, I saw the best.
HORNE
Every honeybee sighs with jealousy
For instance, if Lena Horne was in a movie...
...then it almost had to be from MGM.
Honeysuckle rose
When we're passin' by
Flowers droop and sigh
And I know the reason why
You're much sweeter
Goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose
I don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweet when you stir it up
When I'm takin' sips
From your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips
You're confection
Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose
- 'Cause it's one
- Two
- Three strikes, you're out
- Three strikes, you're out
- At the old ball game
- At the old ball game
When Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly teamed up for a series of films...
...the results were irresistible.
This is one of their best,
Take Me Out to the Ball Game.
Thou swell, thou witty
Thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty?
Wouldst hold my hand?
Both thine eyes are cute too
What they do to me
Hear me holler
I choose a sweet lollapalooza in thee
June Allyson, MGM's most popular musical sweetheart...
...in Rodgers and Hart's Words and Music.
Two rooms and kitchen
I'm sure would do
Give me just a plot of
Not a lot of land
And thou swell
Thou witty, thou grand
Everybody's favorite college musical...
...Good News, starring June Allyson and Peter Lawford.
Those sure were the good old days.
The boy, "garçon"
His girl, "la fille"
That's good, "c'est bon"
The show, "fini"
The moral to this tale
Is not just "parlez-vous"
Send her a billet-doux
Tell her her eyes are blue
They sure are blue.
"Je vous adore" means
I love you
What wonderful years those were at MGM.
One day, I remember meeting a terribly handsome young man from England.
He'd just started work at the studio.
Naturally, I fell wildly in love with him.
I still adore him.
He's still one of my closest and dearest friends.
Peter Lawford.
This building, or what's left of it...
...was, among other things,
Tait College in Good News.
You might say that June Allyson,
Mel Tormé and I graduated from here.
We were all under contract to MGM in those days.
And the studio pretty much told us what pictures we were gonna appear in.
They put us in dramas, comedies and in my case...
...don't ask me why, an occasional musical.
As a singer or dancer, I was ill-equipped to compete with Astaire or Kelly...
...but we did what we were told to do.
When I first came to MGM, the world was at war.
To the Gls overseas and the audiences here at home...
...the musicals were a very special kind of escape...
...both during the war and sfterwards.
The films we made here had a certain style...
...a look that was unmistakable.
Whether it was the directing, or the writing, or the scenery...
...the costumes, the lighting,
I don't really know.
But somehow you could always tell that it was an MGM movie.
Especially the musicals.
All right, cut it.
- Print it, Jane.
- Okay.
All right, take me into number one.
Okay, number one.
Can you see your marks, Joe?
Okay, everybody.
- Quiet! We're rolling.
Speed. Action.
The studio was constantly experimenting...
...constantly showcasing new talent.
For instance, Debbie Reynolds and Carleton
Carpenter in Two Weeks with Love.
Bab-a, dab-a, dab-a
Said the chimpy to the monk
Said the monkey to the chimp
All night long they'd chatter away
All day long they were happy and gay
Swinging and singing
In a honky-tonky way
Bab-a, dab-a, dab-a
Means, "Monk, I love but you"
"Bab-a, dab-a, dab-a" in monkey talk
Means, "Chimp, I love you too"
Then the big baboon, one night in June
He married them, and very soon
They went upon their
Aba daba honeymoon
Elizabeth Taylor starred in A Date With Judy...
...one of the first in a new wave of teenage musicals...
...most of them produced by Joe Pasternak.
That isn't Elizabeth's voice you're hearing.
MGM kept her too busy to rehearse and record.
But her costar, Jane Powell, quickly became one of the studio's...
...most popular young talents.
As an old
Native-born
Californian would say
It's a most unusual day
There are people greeting people
There is sunshine everywhere
There are people greeting people
And a feeling of spring in the air
It's a most unusual time
I keep feeling my temperature climb
If my heart won't behave in the usual way
Well, there's only one thing to say
It's a most unusual
Most unusual
Most unusual day
Here she comes!
Hey, Jim, you better get the rig
She's got a list of passengers
That's pretty big
And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel
'Cause lots of them been travelin'
For quite a spell
All the way to California
On the Atchison, Topeka
On the Atchison, Topeka
And the Santa Fe
The Harvey Girls, directed by George Sidney...
...starred Judy Garland and Ray Bolger.
And this Oscar-winning song was written by Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer.
In this day and age
Girls don't leave home
But if ya get a hankerin'
You wanna roam
Our advice to you is run away
On the Atchison, Topeka
And the
Santa Fe
All aboard!
We came across the country lickety-split
Rolling 90 miles an hour, fit to be tied
I can't believe I'm here at last
When you go traveling
It's natch for you
To take the Atchison, Topeka
And the Santa Fe
I can't believe that anything
Would go so fast
Then you pull that throttle
Whistle blows
A- huffin' and a-puffin'
And away she goes
All aboard for California
- On the Atchison
- On the Atchison
- On the Atchison, Topeka
- On the Atchison, Topeka
- On the Atchison, Topeka and
- On the Atchison, Topeka and
On the Atchison, Topeka
And the
Santa Fe
By the 1950s, the movie musical was reaching a level...
...of inventiveness and sophistication that was pretty hard to top...
...even by today's standards.
But it wasn't always like that.
And here's someone to tell you about it.
And he's pretty hard to top too.
Mr. James Stewart.
In the late 1920s and early '30s...
...these 200 acres of real estate were seeing a panic, pandemonium.
Sound pictures had replaced silent films virtually overnight.
The only actor in town that wasn't worried was Rin Tin Tin.
As long as he could bark, well, sound was no threat to him.
For MGM and the rest of Hollywood...
...there were gloomy days ahead.
Some of the biggest silent stars spoke with thick foreign accents.
Others had a lisp or talked through their noses.
The early microphones seemed to exaggerate the flaws...
...that silent film had hidden.
As quickly as the sound stages went up, careers collapsed.
The studio heads were desperate.
Where would the new stars, the new personalities come from, they wondered.
Well, the answer was obvious.
From the theater, from Broadway.
Theatrical experience suddenly became a passport to Hollywood...
...even if it meant no more than a few weeks of summer stock.
Over the next few years, a steady stream of hopefuls...
...marched through the gates of every studio in town, including MGM.
I should know, I was one of those hungry young actors from the East.
- Sam, is everything all right?
- Okay, Fred.
- How are the cameras?
- All right.
Bob, how are your lights?
All set, whenever you are.
Good. How's the music...?
Musicals were the most popular commodity in the early '30s.
And they were cranked out at an incredible rate.
Most of them really weren't very good.
But if audiences suffered, they didn't complain.
The real victims were the dramatic actors.
The studio pushed nearly every one of them into musical roles.
It must be you
Who carries me away
Here, an uncomfortable
Robert Montgomery tries his best.
But when you're near
The music in my soul
Would fade each time we part
Bob Montgomery was only one of many MGM contract players...
...forced to sing and dance.
In the frantic search for musical stars, many would be called...
...but few would succeed.
Here's one of my favorites.
And I know you all like her too.
Because she's the personification of youth...
...and beauty and joy and happiness,
Joan Crawford.
Did you ever see somebody
Who could love somebody
Much as I love you?
Huh, did you?
You're the kind of sweet somebody
Who could love somebody
How about me too, huh?
Oh, my
You're the one I crave
I could be your slave
Honey, let me rave
Got a feelin' for you
Crazy about your smile
Hey, an easy style
Got it all the time
Got a feelin' for you
Like your turned-up nose
Like your knees down low
From your head to toe
Got a feelin' for you
Did you ever see somebody
Who could love somebody
Much as I love you?
You're the kind of sweet somebody
Who could love somebody
Could you love me too?
You're the one I crave
I could be your slave
Honey, let me say
Got a feelin' for you
What'll you ever be?
What'll you ever do?
How'll you ever know
If you don't take a chance?
Jean Harlow, the blonde bombshell...
...tried out her musical abilities in Reckless.
I wanna live, love, learn a lot
I'll light my candle
And I'll burn a lot
You'll have some bad shots
Hard knocks
I'm on my own if I bruise
And there'll be smiles here
Shouts here
And I can take it on the chin if I lose
Because I'm reckless
Because she's reckless
Reckless
Because I'm reckless
I'm gonna go places
And look life in the face
Hey.
Did I remember
Jean Harlow's musical talents were somewhat limited...
...and the studio usually used someone else's voice for her vocals.
But in a movie called Suzy, her costar,
Cary Grant, did his own singing.
And darn well too.
How do you know?
You didn't hear it.
I assure you I heard every word.
Let me convince you.
Sit down. Gentlemen, play it again.
You be the audience.
Did I remember to tell you you're delightful?
You're everything I want you to be.
Your eyes look lovely
And far beyond comparing
Especially when they're glaring
At me
I can't think up words to say
How swell you are
But I can tell you are
I know so well you are
I started falling
The moment that I saw you
Believe me, I adore you
Chérie
I'm sure you'll hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For you'd be
So easy to love
I was lucky enough to sing a Cole Porter song...
...in Born to Dance with Eleanor Powell.
At first, the studio planned to have someone else record the vocal.
But the tune became such a big hit that they decided to let me do it.
You see...
...they figured the song was so good that even my singing couldn't hurt it.
We'd be so grand
At the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
'Cause you'd be, oh
So easy to love
I know that you'll join us in giving a really rousing, rip-roaring reception...
...to Harry Van and Les Blondes. Mr. Van.
Norma Shearer and Edward
Arnold looked on as Clark Gable...
...made his musical debut in Idiot's Delight.
Hello, people, and thanks a lot for that very lovely reception.
Thanks a million, and I won't settle for a cent less.
In our modest act tonight, we'll be ably assisted...
...by Professor Palova and his talented team. Give them a hand, folks.
Okey-dokey, fellas. Take it away.
- This will be amusing, Achille.
- I hope so.
If you're blue and you don't know
Where to go to
Why don't you go
Where Harlem sits?
Puttin' on the Ritz
Spangled gowns upon the bevy
Of highbrows
But down the levee
All misfits
Puttin' on the Ritz
That's where each and every
Lulu Belle goes
Every Thursday evening
With her swell beaus
Rubbing elbows
Come with me and we'll attend
The jubilee
And see them spend
Their last two bits
Puttin' on the Ritz
Clark Gable surprised everyone with his delightfully corny routine.
And yet, his fans were just outraged...
...to see him even try singing and dancing.
Their hero was above such nonsense.
But it was perfectly all right for a youngster named Judy Garland...
...to dedicate a song to their idol.
Dear Mr. Gable
I am writing this to you
And I hope that you will read it
So you'll know
My heart beats like a hammer
And I stutter and I stammer
Every time I see you
At the picture show
I guess I'm just another fan of yours
And I thought I'd write
And tell you so
You made me love you
I didn't wanna do it
You made me love you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it
You made me happy
Sometimes you made me glad
But there were times, sir
You made me feel so sad
You made me sigh 'cause
I didn't wanna tell you
I think you're grand
That's true
Yes, I do, 'deed I do
You know I do
I don't care what happens
Let the whole world stop
As far as I'm concerned
You'll always be the top
'Cause you know
You made me
Love you
"Dear Mr. Gable" was a milestone in its day.
It was the first time a studio permitted a song to be dedicated to one of its stars.
And it was sung by a little girl...
...who would soon become
MGM's newest star.
And here's someone who can tell you more about that remarkable talent.
He's a remarkable talent himself.
Mickey Rooney.
This is Carvel Street.
For anyone who's ever seen an Andy Hardy movie...
...well, this is where they were all shot, right here.
Over there, that was
Polly Benedict's home across the street.
And this was the home of the Hardy family.
The picket fence is gone, and the mailbox too...
...but it's still the Hardy home.
It might seem strange that a person could spend over 20 years...
...growing up on the same movie set.
But in a way, that's what happened to me.
I was about 10 years old when I first came to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer...
...and I was raring to go.
The movie was Broadway to Hollywood.
And you guessed it, it was a musical.
Well, we... We all change a little over the years, don't we?
You know, when you've been raised at a studio, the way I was...
...you learn a certain ability that time can't seem to erase.
You learn to recognize real talent.
You see so many people come and go...
...that when an exceptional talent comes along...
...it seems to stick out like a sore thumb.
I was a seasoned veteran of 17 when I first had the opportunity...
...of working with the great and wonderful Judy Garland.
I knew when I saw her standing before the camera...
...that she had that certain magic.
Her talent seemed to jump right off the screen at you.
Do re mi fa so la ti do
Judy and I became close friends when we did a series of films together...
...that the studio called
"backyard musicals. "
Audiences seemed to love the pictures...
...even though the plots were suspiciously alike.
Only our names seemed to change.
How do you do?
Good morning. I'm Betsy Booth.
- I sing, you know.
- I know, I heard you.
You're Andy Hardy, aren't you?
This is Barbara Jo. This is Mr. Williams.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Williams.
Danny, this is my grandchild,
Ms. Ginger Gray.
- Yes, we've met.
- This is my cousin, Ms. Polly Williams.
Mr. Daniel Churchill, a junior.
Ms. Barton, this is Ms. Essex, the once famous "Baby Rosalie. "
How do you do? This is Mickey Moran.
How do you do?
My name's Williams, Tommy Williams.
What's yours?
- I don't think I like you.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
- I want success.
- And you'll have it.
I know you will, Mickey. Just think when our names are up in electric lights.
You the big composer and producer, and me the singing star.
We could have our own great modern dance orchestra.
We've got everything we need here.
We've got the brass...
...the piano and the reeds.
We can make our own arrangements, specialties and play for all the dances.
We've gotta have a great show with a million laughs.
And color, a lot of lights to make it sparkle.
And songs, wonderful songs with you out there selling them.
It'll be wonderful.
Say, that's not a bad idea.
We could put on our own show.
That'd be different.
Why, it looks as if you'll need a whole city block.
Yeah. Sure, that's it.
Right in the neighborhood, and everybody'll come to it.
A Western rodeo, once a year we'll bring back the West.
- Daniel Boone.
- Jesse James, Buffalo Bill.
- A hundred beautiful girls.
- On horseback.
- Glorious costumes, happy, carefree.
- Gay!
I'm gonna write a show for us right here in Seaport.
It'd be the most up-to-date thing these hicks around here have seen.
Opening night, we'll have
Max Gordon and Sam Harris...
...down to give us the once-over.
How about it, kids?
- They call us babes in arms
- We never dance
- They think they must direct us
- But no chance
- But if we're babes in arms
- High romance
- We'll make them all respect us
- Why, oh, why
Why have we got our arms
What have we got our sight for?
Play day is done
We've a place in the sun
We must fight for
When our movies took off at the box office...
...we found our budgets taking off too.
So they moved Judy and I out of the backyard and into the barn...
...then to the high school gym...
...and later to a Broadway stage that would never have fit in a real theater.
Where we got all that energy,
I'll never know.
But a lot of it was inspired by our director, a genius...
...Busby Berkeley.
Small town
Living in a small town
When you're in a small town
You gotta make friends
- One, two, three
- One, two, three
Watch them shuffling along
See them shuffling along
Go take your best gal
Your real pal
Go down on the levee
I said to the levee
And we'll join that shuffling throng
Hear that music and song
It's simply great, mate
Waitin' on the levee
Waitin' for the Robert E. Lee
We're babes on Broadway
We're goin' places
When our new faces appear
It's a wonderful street
For babes like us to be on
We're here because
We want our names in neon
We left Topeka
We left Eureka
And came to seek a career
Oh, we're milkin' applause
Instead of milkin' a cow
'Cause we're babes on Broadway now
With our flag unfurled
We can face the world
Hey, leader
Strike up the band
There's another fellow who worked on this lot with Judy...
...and some of MGM's best musicals...
...are a direct result of his considerable talents.
Gene Kelly.
This is MGM's New York street.
And for as long as I can remember...
...this has been the busiest standing set on the whole backlot.
Any actor or actress...
...who made more than one or two films at this studio...
...sooner or later probably would find himself shooting a sequence here.
Which reminds me, if you're a song-and-dance man...
...and you've spent some time in pictures...
...inevitably, some interviewer will ask:
"Who was your favorite dancing partner?
Was it Rita Hayworth, or Vera-Ellen, or Leslie Caron?"
But if you're smart, you'll never give them a straight answer.
I'm gonna break that rule right now.
It may not be gallant...
...but I'd like to show you the greatest partner I've ever danced with.
When you dance with Fred Astaire, you really have to be on your toes.
This number from Ziegfeld Follies...
...was the only time we've had a chance to work together.
But I'd change my name to Ginger if we could do it again.
Fred Astaire has been the tops...
...in every field of show business he ever entered.
And the motion-picture musical owes him a great deal.
The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, no
They can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off-key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, no
They can't take that away from me
When he starred in a series of musicals with Ginger Rogers...
...they quickly became the most popular dance team...
...in the history of motion pictures.
But for Fred, as an individual...
...it was only the beginning of a screen career...
...that would delight several generations of moviegoers.
Stand up and sing
We've got the gang together
We always sang together
Stand up and sing
Over the years,
Fred Astaire's trademark would become...
...the top hat and tails.
He wore the outfit in his very first film appearance...
...Dancing Lady with Joan Crawford.
I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized
There'd be another man
Jack Buchanan, the debonair British musical star...
...joined Fred in The Band Wagon.
Until the big affair began
Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf
And that was that
I tried to reach the moon
But when I got there
All that I could get was the air
My feet are back upon the ground
I've lost the one girl I'd found
But besides elegance, there's a lot more to the Astaire style.
Fred was constantly striving for perfection.
Rehearsing hour sfter hour...
...searching for a new step or a new device...
...that would bring something fresh to each of his numbers.
Because of his ingenuity and precision...
...audiences never realized how much incredible effort...
...Fred poured into his work.
He made it all appear so easy.
In Royal Wedding,
Fred danced with a hat rack.
And as usual, he made his partner look good.
In The Barkleys of Broadway...
...Fred and choreographer Hermes Pan...
...conceived the brilliant
"Shoes With Wings On" number.
Fred and director Stanley Donen...
...collaborated on this mind-boggling routine from Royal Wedding.
Movie buffs are still arguing about how it was done.
The gimmicks Fred used were exciting and fun.
But his talents were so extraordinary...
...that he could easily get along without them.
This is the Astaire I love to watch.
With a lovely partner like Cyd Charisse...
...a simple settiing...
...a marvelous song by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz...
...these are the only ingredients
Fred would need...
...to create a classic moment.
"Dancing in the Dark" from The Band Wagon.
Fred Astaire was and is a unique talent.
There'll never be another like him...
...and that's what I love about our profession.
Because every so often an artist comes along...
...who's impossible to compare with anyone else.
Here's another of my favorite dancing partners...
...Donald O'Connor.
MGM seemed to acquire talent the way you and I pick up paper clips...
...by the handful.
When I was at the studio...
...we were up to our ears in tenors, baritones, tap dancers, pianists...
...and they were all good.
But this set belonged pretty much to one star...
...and one star alone.
I only wish we'd had a chance to work together.
Well, she was not only a lovely actress, with a beautiful face and figure...
...but she could also sing and dance, and even handle comedy.
And if that wasn't enough, she was dynamite in the water.
Of course I'm talking about
Ms. Esther Williams.
A champion swimmer...
...Esther was working as a model in a Los Angeles department store...
...when MGM talent scouts discovered her.
The studio built a special swimming pool for her on the backlot...
...and starred her in a film called
Bathing Beauty.
The rest is history.
MGM featured Esther in a series of spectacular productions.
During her career, she swam...
...opposite some of MGM's most popular leading men.
Some of them even got their hair wet.
Like Howard Keel...
...Fernando Lamas, whom she would later marry...
...Van Johnson...
...Peter Lawford...
...Ricardo Montalban...
...even Tom and Jerry.
Jimmy Durante...
...and Red Skelton.
As her fame grew...
...so did the size and population of her swimming pools.
Esther no longer could simply climb up a diving board and jump in.
Now, she had to be presented like Venus...
...rising from the sea.
In the ranks of great musical stars, there have been singers, dancers...
...musicians, even ice skaters.
But MGM saw to it there was only one Esther Williams.
Eat your heart out, Mark Spitz.
People say that performers are overly affectionate with one another.
And that may be true.
I don't have to apologize for the way I feel...
...about a young lady that I worked with here at MGM.
I love her.
And she's as big a hit right now on Broadway...
...as she was here in Hollywood.
She never stops.
Miss Debbie Reynolds.
I made my first movie for MGM back in 1950.
Remember Three Little Words?
Hey, fellas, can we borrow your piano just a minute?
Of course, the real stars were
Fred Astaire and Red Skelton...
...but see that funny-looking kid coming down the steps?
Look out, Hollywood. Here I come.
I wanna be loved by you alone
Boop-boop-bee-doo
I wanna be loved by you
Just you
And nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
Alone
Carleton Carpenter and I only did this one number in the picture.
But it certainly helped our careers.
Even though the voice wasn't mine...
...MGM brought in the song's originator,
Helen Kane, to sing the vocal.
And make you my own
Bap-bap-bee-dap
Boop-boop-ba-doo
I wanna be loved by you
Just you
And nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
Bap-bap-bee-dap-bee-dap-bee-dap
Boop-boop-ba-doo
When I first reported at the studio...
...MGM was celebrating its 25th anniversary.
They had converted the biggest sound stage on the lot into a restaurant.
They only served one meal, but it was a lunch that old-timers still talk about.
The studio used to boast that it had more stars than there are in the heavens.
And that day, they weren't kidding.
The first time I met the king,
Clark Gable...
...he looked down at me and said,
"Hello, beautiful. "
And I nearly fainted.
This place was the land of giants, and I was a small fry.
But like any other young hopeful,
I was determined...
...that somehow and someday
I'd measure up.
In the early 1950s...
...MGM was entering a new era of motion pictures...
...with more star power...
...than virtually every other studio in Hollywood combined.
I've gotta hear that beat
I've gotta hear those drums
And even when it comes to romance
When I feel that I might fall
I always stall and play it smart
Till I hear that beat
I've gotta hear that beat
That certain beat in my heart
Ann Miller, the best tap-dancing lady on the lot.
Annie's talents and Busby Berkeley's imaginative direction...
...were a perfect combination in Small Town Girl.
Be my love
For no one else can...
A truck driver from Philadelphia became the most sensational new voice...
...in motion pictures.
Mario Lanza. He made only a few films.
And The Toast of New Orleans with Kathryn Grayson was one of his best.
Just fill my arms
The way you've filled my dreams
The dreams that you inspire
With every sweet desire
Be my love
And with your kisses set me burning
One kiss is all I need to seal my fate
And hand in hand
We'll find love's promised land
There'll be no one but you for me
Eternally
If you will be
My love
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Don't you know
Everyone wants to laugh
Donald O'Connor in Singin' in the Rain...
...in my opinion, the funniest musical number ever done.
They'll be standin' in lines
For those old honky-tonk monkeyshines
Or you could study Shakespeare
And be quite elite
And you can charm the critics
And have nothin' to eat
Just slip on a banana peel
The world's at your feet
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Don't you know
Everyone wants to laugh
My grandpa said
Go out and tell 'em a joke
But give it plenty of hoke
Make 'em roar, make 'em scream
Take a fall, butt a wall, split a seam
You start off by pretending
You're a dancer with grace
You wiggle 'till they're giggling
All over the place
And then you get a great big
Custard pie in the face
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Don't you... All the...
My dad...
They'll be standing in lines
For those old honky-tonk monkeyshines
Make 'em laugh
Make 'em laugh
Don't you know
Make 'em laugh

I love you
For to tell the truth
I do
Ol' man tiver
That ol' man river
He must know somethin'
But don't say nothin'
He just keeps rollin'
He keeps on rollin'
Along
You and me, we sweat and strain
Body all aching and racked with pain
Tote that barge and lift that bale
You get a little drunk
And you land in
Jail
I gets weary
And sick of trying
I'm tired of living
And scared of dying
But ol' man river
He just keeps rolling
Along
I'll go my way by myself
Like a bird on the wing
I remember something else
I learned at the studio...
...during my stay there. MGM's motto:
"Do it big, do it right, and give it class. "
I'd like you to meet someone who certainly measures up to that phrase.
He's the classiest gentleman
I've ever worked with.
Mr. Fred Astaire.
I'm by myself
Alone
I have a great many fond memories about this place.
So many happy moments worrying about whether or not...
...we were getting the job done.
What fun.
We shot some of The Band Wagon here.
Being here again brings to mind some of the wonderful people...
...I've worked with over the years.
One of them in particular...
...is my long-time friend...
...Gene Kelly.
In The Pirate with the Nicholas Brothers...
...Gene displayed the rough-and-tumble kind of acrobatic dancing...
...that quickly became a popular part of his repertoire.
From the start,
Gene was constantly experimenting...
...from classical ballet to a burlesque buck-and-wing.
He was determined to broaden the horizons of the film musical.
And in doing so, he became one of the most versatile...
...and original performers the movies have ever known.
Kelly was forever breaking rules.
Though the studio often tried to stop him...
...Gene insisted on doing his own stunts.
His bosses always seemed to find out about it sfter the scene had been shot.
But audiences loved the sight of Gene himself...
...flying through the air in film sfter film.
New York, New York, a wonderful town
The Bronx is up and the Battery's down
The people ride in a hole in the ground
New York, New York
It's a wonderful town
In On the Town with Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin...
...Manhattan became the backdrop for this unforgettable romp.
A tribute to Gene's persistence...
...it was the first major musical to be filmed on location.
The famous places to visit are so many
Or so the guidebooks say
I told my grandpa I wouldn't miss on any
But we got just one day
Gotta see the whole town
Right from Yonkers on down to the bay
In just one day
New York, New York, a wonderful town
The Bronx is up and the Battery's down
The people ride in a hole in the ground
New York, New York
It's a wonderful town
Manhattan women are all in silk and satin
Or so the fellas say
There's just one thing necessary
In Manhattan
When you got just one day
Gotta pick up a date, maybe seven or eight
On your way
In just one day
New York, New York, a wonderful town
The Bronx is up and the Battery's down
The people ride in a hole in the ground
New York, New York
It's a wonderful town
I've had a lot of partners in my day.
But can you imagine a grown man dancing with a mouse?
Well, Gene did just that in Anchors Aweigh.
His dancing partner was Jerry the Mouse of Tom and Jerry fame.
Critics said it was the most effective use of live and animation technique...
...ever put on film.
And I certainly agree.
Look at me. I'm dancing.
More than any other star, I think
Gene Kelly became the symbol...
...of the MGM musical of the 1950s.
And here's a classic routine that audiences would never forget.
This is my favorite number from one of his very best musicals...
...Singin' in the Rain.
I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feelin'
I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face
I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
Just singin'
Singin' in the rain
Dancin' in the rain
I'm happy again
I'm singin' and dancin' in the rain
I'm dancin' and singin'
In the rain
The finale to the Broadway ballet from Singin' in the Rain...
...seems to me to exemplify the genius of Gene Kelly.
Actor, singer, dancer, choreographer and director.
Gotta dance
Gotta dance
Gotta dance
Gotta dance
That's the Broadway
Melody
You've seen Gene Kelly's work on the screen.
I think I've said it all.
He's one of those rare talents who really understands...
...what the movie musical is all about.
Now I'd like you to meet someone that recently joined the gang.
If Hollywood breeding could be compared to royalty...
...then she would certainly be our crown princess.
I remember so well when she, as a tiny little girl...
...used to sit on the set watching her father, Vincente Minnelli...
...directing me in several pictures.
Her mother, the fabulous Judy Garland.
Yet this young lady has made it all on her own. Yes, she has.
Miss Liza Minnelli.
The first studio I'd ever been inside was MGM.
I can't really say that I grew up here.
But I know that for over 10 years,
I'd race like crazy after school...
...to get down here and visit whatever set my parents were on.
You may not know this...
...but I made my film debut at MGM.
MINNELLl: In the very last shot for
The Good Old Summertime...
...they needed a little girl to play the daughter...
...of Van Johnson and Mama.
Guess who got the part.
There she is, folks. What personality.
No wonder I didn't get any billing.
It's no wonder this place will always be a part of me.
My father directed dozens of films here...
...and Mama, well, this was her home for over 15 years...
...and 30 films.
It began in 1935.
MINNELLl:
In an MGM musical short...
...a vaudeville team called the Gumm Sisters...
...made their first appearance on film.
Twelve-year-old Frances was the standout...
...and talent scouts from MGM decided to give her a chance.
But first they changed her name from Frances Gumm to Judy Garland.
The studio put Mom in another short subject.
This time they paired her off with a young operatic singer named...
...Deanna Durbin.
These musical shorts were like a screen test.
In those days, if you came across in a two-reeler...
...you just might have a chance in a real musical.
Swing
North, south, east, west
Just swing
You'll find that swing is best
Swing
Make it a national thing
You'll find
There is a chance for romance
Here on the dance floor, so dance
Dance, dance, dance
America
MINNELLl: Although MGM would drop
Deanna Durbin...
...some executives at the studio pleaded to keep my mother under contract.
And they finally won.
Well, they kept her at MGM just barely.
She spent the next few years in low-budget musicals.
Once in a while, she'd appear as a sort of novelty act...
...in a big extravaganza like the Broadway Melody of 1938...
...with Buddy Ebsen.
Mama once told me...
...MGM seemed obsessed with Shirley Temple.
They even offered 20th Century Fox
Jean Harlow and Clark Gable...
...just to get Temple for a certain picture
Metro was preparing.
But the deal fell through.
So MGM finally went ahead with the picture...
...and let Mama play the role of Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.
You're off to see the wizard
The wonderful wizard of Oz
You'll find he is a whiz of a wiz
If ever a wiz there was
If ever, oh, ever a wiz there was
The wizard of Oz is one because
Because, because, because
Because, because
Because of the wonderful things he does
I'm afraid there's no denyin'
I'm just a dandelion
A fate I don't deserve
I'd be brave as a blizzard
I'd be gentle as a lizard
I'd be clever as a gizzard
If the Wizard is a Wizard
Who will serve
Then I'm sure to get a brain
- A heart
- A home
The nerve
MINNELLl:
The Wizard of Oz finally did it for Mama.
With Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, and Bert Lahr...
...she really started off on the road to success.
Whatever rocks or bumps there were in that road...
...she never let it show in her films.
For Mama, it was straight up all the way.
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
They're writing songs of love
But not for me
A lucky star's above
But not for me
With love to lead the way
I've found more skies of gray
Than any Russian play
Could guarantee
Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
Ding, ding, ding went the bell
Zing, zing, zing went my heartstrings
From the moment I saw him, I fell
Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Bump, bump, bump went the brake
Thump, thump, thump
Went my heartstrings
When he smiled
I could feel the car shake
He tipped his hat and took a seat
He said he hoped
He hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name, I held my breath
I couldn't speak
Because he scared me half to death
Howdy Doody!
Chug, chug, chug went the motor
Flop, flop, flop went the wheels
Stop, stop, stop went my heartstrings
As he started to go
Then I started to know
How it feels
When the universe reels
If you like-a me, like I like-a you
And we like-a both the same
I like-a say this very day
I like-a change your name
'Cause I love-a you and love-a you true
And if you-a love-a me
One live as two, two live as one
Under the bamboo tree
How can I ignore
The boy next door
I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never sees me
Glance his way
MINNELLl: Summer Stock was Mama's final film for MGM.
Her last days of shooting here were devoted to this number...
...which a lot of people including myself feel was one of her very best.
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
Get ready for the judgment day
The sun is shining
Come on, get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
We're going to the promised land
We're heading across the river
Wash your sins away in the tide
It's all so peaceful on the other side
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
Get ready for the judgment day
Forget your troubles
Come on, get happy
Chase your cares away
Hallelujah
Get happy
Before the judgment day
The sun is shining
Come on, get happy
The Lord is waiting to take your hand
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
We're going to be going to the promised land
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
You better chase all your cares away
Shout hallelujah
Come on, get happy
Get ready
For the judgment day
Thank God for film.
It can capture a performance and hold it right there forever.
And if anyone says to you,
"Who was he?" or "Who was she?"
Or "What made them so good?"
I think a piece of film answers that question better than any words I know of.
My generation...
Well, we're just beginning.
It takes a lot of film and a lot of experience...
...and a lot of talent to become a real star.
Now here's somebody who I think qualifies on all of those counts. Oh, boy.
Mr. Bing Crosby.
You know, one sound stage, well, it looks pretty much like another.
But a backlot, out here where they shoot the exteriors...
...that seems to me that the backlot reflects the personality...
...the character of its studio.
This was the biggest...
...and I think, perhaps, the best backlot in all of Hollywood.
Of course the old backlot looks a little shabby right now, sort of scruffy...
...kind of an illusion on an illusion...
...but that's because most Hollywood filmmakers...
...they don't use backlots any more.
They prefer the real thing.
Hollywood
Hollywood
I remember when I did my first musical at this studio...
...they designed a big production number.
It was all to take place in a vast Manhattan railroad terminal.
Of course we didn't bother to go to New York City.
MGM simply recreated
Grand Central Station...
...added a couple of thousand extras and filmed the whole number right here.
Once again
Goodbye, pal
Out where they say
Let us be gay
I'm going Hollywood
I'll ballyhoo greetings to you
I'm going Hollywood
Say, while you sleepyheads
Are in that hay
I'll be dancing
I'm gonna be dancing
With a sun-kissed baby
And I'm on my way
Here's my beret
I'm going Hollywood
Well, it was vigorous. Spirited, anyhow.
I was, what you might call, a casual participant in MGM musicals...
...because over 20 years went by...
...between the little effort which you've just seen...
...and my next attempt.
And I found fantastic changes had occurred.
They had color, oh, stereophonic sound, even wide screens.
And MGM, in a loose moment, had decided to give me another chance...
...in a little pastiche to be called High Society.
This starred Grace Kelly, Louis Armstrong, and Celeste Holm...
...and was directed by Chuck Walters.
Oh, yes, there was another featured performer in there.
What was his name?
A brash young newcomer. Frank, uh...
A clever kid.
He had a lot to offer too. Frank, uh...
Well, you'll recognize him when you see the footage.
Have you heard about dear Blanche?
- Got run down by an avalanche
- No.
Don't worry, she's a game girl, you know.
Got up and finished fourth.
- Kid's got guts.
- Having a nice time?
Grab a line.
- Have you heard that Mimsie Starr
- What now?
- She got pinched in the Astor Bar
- Sauced again, eh?
She was stoned.
- Well, did you ever?
- Never.
What a swell party this is
- I'm gonna have a drink.
- I may have a bit of the bubbly myself.
- I'm gonna dance.
- Don't get hurt.
Oh, no.
- It's great
- It's great
- It's grand
- So grand
It's wonderland
- We sing
- We sing
- So rare
- So rare
Like old Camembert
Like baba au rhum
Don't dig that kinda croonin', chum
You must be one of the newer fellas.
Have you heard?
It's in the stars
Next July we collide with Mars
Well, did you ever?
What a swell party
Swell party
Swellegant, elegant party
This is
While I give to you
And you give to me
True love
So on and on
It'll always be
True love
For you and I
Have a guardian angel
On high
With nothing to do
But to give to you
And to give to me
Love forever
True
Love forever
True
I'm recalling times when I was falling
Like a free jubilee day
Get this cast:
Russ Tamblyn, Vic Damone,
Tony Martin...
...Kay Armen, Debbie Reynolds,
Jane Powell, Ann Miller...
...and the Pacific Fleet...
...in Hit the Deck.
Sing hallelujah, hallelujah
And you'll shoo the blues away
When cares pursue ya
Hallelujah
Gets you thru the darkest day
Satan lies a-waitin'
- And creatin' skies of gray
- Skies of gray
But hallelujah, hallelujah
Helps to shoo the clouds away
Satan lies a-waitin'
- And creatin' skies of gray
- Hallelu
But hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Helps to shoo the clouds away
Sing hallelu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lujah
The next time anyone says that dancing is for sissies...
...remind them of
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
Produced by Jack Cummings, directed by Stanley Donen...
...and choreographed by Michael Kidd...
...it's perhaps the most vivid and exuberant ballet ever put on film.
Gigi
Am I a fool without a mind
Or have I merely been too blind to realize
Oh, Gigi
Why you've been growing up
Before my eyes
Gigi
You're not at all
That funny awkward little girl
I knew
Oh, no
Overnight there's been
A breathless change
In you
One of the finest musicals ever made...
...Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's Gigi.
It was that rare blend of story and song...
...and it starred Leslie Caron,
Louis Jourdan, Hermione Gingold...
...and the marvelous Maurice Chevalier.
All under the inspired direction of Vincente Minnelli.
- May I come in?
- Yes.
Gaston, please.
No newspapers, no scandal.
Madame, will you do me the honor...
...the favor...
...give me the infinite joy of bestowing on me...
...Gigi's hand in marriage.
Thank heaven.
For little girls
For little girls get bigger every day
Thank heaven for little girls
They grow up in the most delightful way
Those little eyes
So helpless and appealing
One day will flash and send you crashin'
Through the ceiling
Thank heaven for little girls
Thank heaven for them all
No matter where, no matter who
Without them, what would little boys do?
- Thank heaven
- Thank heaven
Thank heaven
For little girls
Through the years, MGM has produced over 200 musical films.
And if you had to select one number from one film...
...that would best represent the MGM musicals...
...I have a feeling that the vote would be unanimous...
...especially among the people who worked here...
...and that's why we've saved the best for the last.
An American in Paris, starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron.
It won an Oscar as best picture of the year...
...over 20 years ago.
But the ballet from that film...
...is as timeless as the day you and I first saw it.
Produced by Arthur Freed, directed by Vincente Minnelli...
...and choreographed by Gene Kelly...
...it can only be described as MGM's masterpiece.
Hey, Phones, good morning.
Hey, what's happening, buddy?
Let's go skate, come on.
Hey, Bobby.
Look, it's Jumping Jack Flash!
- It's Conway!
- Oh, no!
Hang on!
- Good morning, Ada.
- Good morning, Terry.
- Is everyone up yet?
- In the dining room.
Eggs soft enough, Roger?
Good morning, lovey. Drink your juice.
Well, I thought I'd go down to the beach today and commit suicide.
That's nice, lovey. Have a good day.
Well, if anybody wants me,
I'll be at the city morgue.
Kids.
Let's go.
You and your fads, Terry.
Honestly, roller skating?
Next thing, you'll have me surfing, or some such horrendous thing.
You'd rather not go?
Not after I bought my skate bag at Gucci's.
Okay, thank you.
Have a nice day. Stay off the bike path.
- How you doing, Phones?
- Okay.
- You need these?
- No.
Have a nice day. We'll see you later, okay?
- Listen. This is great! This is bad!
- Hey, Phones. What's happening, man?
You're looking fantastic for the Roller Boogie contest.
Bobby, why don't you come and skate with us, okay?
- Baby, I gotta work.
- Come on, please? Just for a little while.
- Skate with us.
- Please?
All right. I'll be back. Take care of the place.
Come on, man. Do it!
Come on, Bobby!
- You're next.
- I don't think so.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Bye-bye.
Your money or your life, twinkle boots.
Yeah, how'd you like your neck permanent waved?
He's turning blue, homeboy.
He's turning blue!
Sorry, Bobby.
The guy's working out.
Here's yours.
You guys know that girl?
You mean, "Don't touch me, you brute?"
Yeah, I just saw her pull in in a million-dollar car... over at the parking lot.
Probably some rink skater from Beverly Hills.
No, man.
No rinks in Beverly Hills, just minks.
Come on, forget it, Bobby.
She is way out of your league, man.
My Franklin, your Theresa.
Our two geniuses.
So we thought about London or the Paris Conservatory... but we accepted the Juilliard scholarship... because we could just hop over, stay in the Hamptons--
- And shopping in Manhattan.
- Lillian, please, I'm talking.
Then, we could see Theresa, be back here in no time at all.
Actually, I think New York would be good for her.
A more mature attitude toward her music and all that, you know.
Sitting on the lap of creativity.
I'm sorry, he put his hands on...
I mean, it was an accident. I'm sorry.
- Franklin, take those off!
- In the house.
Franklin, I swear!
You have more hands than a poker game!
Going slumming at the beach again?
Your mother thinks you're going out with me.
Franklin, I'm not in the mood for octopus rally!
Terry, I need you.
Your body is driving me crazy.
Franklin, Barbie dolls drive you crazy.
- You're oversexed.
- Come on, Terry.
Franklin, stop it!
Terry, give me back that towel.
Terry, I'm sorry. Please, come on.
My mother's inside.
So what? It's not that big a thing, anyway.
Terry, come on. Come back!
Bye.
Terry, come back!
Mother.
- And he is the best we got.
- Excuse me.
- You guys, look here.
- Excuse me.
It's the golden girls of Beverly Hills.
How's old Bev Hills these days?
- Let me help you.
- All right, a telephone, man!
Give me Alaska.
Let me get your bag for you, okay?
Here you go.
How you doing?
My name is Gordo, remember me?
How you doing?
Hope you have a good time skating.
Excuse me, Miss Buns.
Come on, will you, Bobby.
Come on, look at her car, man.
Look at her car, then look at yourself.
That's three things that don't match: this car, you, and that chick.
I'm telling you, man.
I got $5 says she'll skate with me tonight.
You do? $5? You're on, sucker.
- Here's mine.
- What is this?
That's my IOU. I'm good for it.
Come on, let's go.
Hey! Are you crazy?
What was that?
That was Complete Control Conway, the one-man destruction derby.
- Lovely. I'm fine, thank you.
- You sure are.
- You can let go now.
- I know that.
- Would you do it?
- Not until you say you'll skate with me.
Hey, I saved your life.
You're the best skater on the boardwalk, true?
I don't know. I do okay.
I need someone to teach me how to dance on skates.
I'll pay you $10 an hour.
Here's $5 in advance. I'm gonna freshen up.
You ain't skating with her yet.
Say, look, you!
- Yes?
- Something about this isn't right.
Hey, wait up!
Sorry, ladies.
Okay, everybody, it's time to play.
It is couples-only time. Couples only.
Come on, this is a good song.
It's almost over.
What's your name, anyway?
Did you see me in that commercial?
I'll bet you can't skate, anyway.
Ready?
This is all screwed up.
I'm supposed to ask you if you wanna skate.
- Okay, ask.
- Do you wanna skate or something?
Sure, I wanna skate or something.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
What are you, a prejudiced person?
Let's go out there and dance a little.
You don't want to dance with me?
You win, sucker. There.
Don't get scared.
I'm gonna show you something.
Just relax and stay loose.
All right, it's time to get on down with a new sound. Here we go.
I think it's your wheel.
Bobby, you clown. You know that music hurts my poor old ears.
- Terry Barkley, Jammer Delany.
- Hi.
Hello, love.
- My God, but you sure are pretty.
- Thank you.
- Anything she needs, I'm good for it.
- Okay.
Did you know
Jam was eight-time National Champion?
Fastest man through the pack on skates.
That was until they took my knee cap apart in six places.
Boy, I'm telling you, skating's changed a lot since I was a top jammer.
I'm sure it has.
- You got a wrench?
- I think so.
Good.
- Here we go.
- All right, thanks a lot, Jammer.
You're welcome, Bobby.
- Enjoy yourself now, love.
- I shall. Thank you.
Wrong one.
Top jammer?
You know, Roller Derby.
Sure, my parents watch it every night on TV.
Okay.
This one's just as nice as the other one.
Hey, Terry, wait up.
Wait up!
Thanks for skating with me, kid.
We still have 45 minutes left.
And my name ain't "Kid," it's Bobby.
- Bobby James.
- Keep the change, Bobby James.
Terry, will there be anything else?
- No thanks, Ada. My folks come home yet?
- Child, didn't they tell you?
They went to the Palm Springs house for the weekend.
I forgot.
Listen, I can stay over if you don't want to be alone.
No, it's okay. You go on home.
I'll be fine, thank you.
All right, dear.
Last time my mama went to Palm Springs, she came home with a new papa.
- Now she's in Mexico, dear thing.
- Doing what, pray tell?
Getting rid of my new papa.
Then it's back to the Springs for another try.
My parents don't have to tell me where they're going.
Why should I tell them where I'm going, right?
Where are you going?
Crazy! Anybody wanna come?
She's off to the beach again.
Her choice of friends leaves something to be desired.
She picked you, didn't she?
Franklin, you nerd! You ruined my nails!
Okay, put another 20 pounds on that, boy.
Another 20 pounds, Master Hoppy?
Why, sure enough, sir!
Coming right on up here.
Okay, now.
I got it!
Okay.
I think he's got it!
How long have we had this chest pain, my boy?
- Get it off, you pinheads!
- Watch out.
What the hell do you think you're doing, man?
These guys.
We're going to the pier later.
You wanna come?
I gotta practice.
Come on, man.
There's a new waitress at Casa Cucaracha.
- She wants your body anytime, day or night.
- She said she loved Olympic skaters.
- She did not.
- Did, too.
I got one hour of workout, two hours practice.
- You know my routine.
- All right, give it a break, man.
- Let's go find some women.
- I'll see you later.
- Come on!
- Don't be a drag!
Get off my case!
My time is my own, you get it?
No Olympic judge is gonna vote for a turkey boardwalk skater.
That waitress... is she a real fox?
- Yeah, a fox, man.
- That chick's uglier than her enchiladas.
Rich chicks, gold medals, Olympics...
Always wants something he can't have.
You're gonna regret this in the morning.
They're just your parents, Barkley.
They're not supposed to understand.
I don't give a damn if they don't have time for me anymore.
I'm a big girl, right?
Who needs to know where they're going or when they'll be back.
They don't owe me anything.
Your mother brings you a new father when she comes home.
That's something, at least.
You are acting so childish.
Our little genius is throwing a temper tantrum.
When are you gonna come back?
I'll be back when I get here.
- Let's go.
- Oh, it's you.
- You still owe me 45 minutes.
- You got a mental problem or something?
You wanna skate, and then you don't wanna skate.
What is it with you?
- I was watching you. You're very good.
- I know that.
Well, excuse me if you don't have time.
Sit down. I'll be just a minute.
If that was meant to impress me, it did.
You're very good.
You should do something with that talent.
The Olympics will be around soon.
The Olympics? That's a lot to bite off.
- I got a big appetite.
- I guess you do.
Okay, let's do it!
- Are we gonna do it right here?
- Anywhere you want to.
You don't waste any time, do you?
- I was talking about skating.
- Sure you were.
Is that one of your better moves?
Where is she? This really gripes me.
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
I just don't understand you.
You coming on so strong and all.
What do you want from me?
What does any woman want from a man?
Look, you're not no bimbo from the boardwalk.
Are you sure you wanna do it?
I don't believe you just said that.
I don't believe I said it, either.
You're not figuring on paying me for this, too, are you?
What in the hell was that for?
I mean, you started it!
Because I didn't plan to be seduced on the beach!
You just wanna forget about the whole thing?
I just wanted someone to hold me.
Was that too much to ask for?
Terry, wait up.
Where have you been?
We've been looking everywhere.
When are you gonna give up this tacky scene?
- What's wrong?
- Fella, I don't know who you are... or what you are, but I don't like the look of this, understand?
Get your hands off me!
Look, fella, I said--
Just marvelous!
Now how are we gonna get home?
My humble chariot at your service, madam.
May I recommend a passion fruit?
Come on, right this way.
I think he broke my nose.
Let's just get you to the hospital then.
Hey, you.
Taking the kook to the hospital room!
Yeah, and then to Lana's.
What's the matter, lovey?
Why are you sitting on the stairs?
Franklin Potter breaking your heart?
I'll have a talk with his mother.
- Do you love me?
- What a question to ask.
- What about Daddy?
- Lovey, where is all this going?
At the end of summer, I go to school.
When I come back, I'll be a woman.
- Yes, but--
- I never had a chance to be young!
Lovey, you are different.
Even your father doesn't understand how you do those things with music.
So what? I'm a musical genius.
What a drag! What a bummer!
Drag? Bummer?
Lovey, you're giving your mother a migraine.
Diet pills... sleeping pills, diuretics, Quaaludes...
Valium, there you are.
If I'm old enough to be on my own... then I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
I do not wanna play the flute.
I do not wanna go to Juilliard.
I do not wanna be paired off with Franklin Potter.
He is a lecherous jackass!
And I never wanna hear another string quartet again in my life!
Now that we know what you don't want... what is it that you do?
For now...
I wanna win a Roller Boogie contest down at the beach.
A Roller Boogie contest?
I'm sure that you'll accomplish whatever you put your mind to.
I mean, you always do.
I have to meet your father for lunch... and we'll talk. We'll see.
She didn't understand a thing I said.
Hello?
Lady, this is a pay phone.
You want me to look where?
All right, just a minute.
- You Bobby James?
- Yeah.
- It's for you.
- For me?
He'll be here in a minute.
Hello?
- Good morning.
- Good morning, yourself. Who is this?
Terry Barkley. Remember me?
Sure, I remember you. Why'd you run away?
How'd that guy know that was me in the window?
I love your outfit.
Centerfold of Playgirl?
Come on, Terry, this is really weird.
Blue shorts, how cute.
Come on. Where are you?
The parking lot.
How about breakfast?
On me.
Sure.
Why do you keep staring at me like that?
- Like what?
- Like you're trying to read my mind.
I wished I could.
You're dealing with something heavy, right?
It's all right. I'm a big girl. I can handle it.
Yeah, like running away from home, and running away from me.
You're handling it just great.
I'm sorry I slapped you and ran away.
I was being a real bitch.
And you were handy.
I'd still like you to teach me to skate.
Same price?
$25 an hour.
All right.
- Sorry I asked.
If I teach you to skate, it's because I want to.
You get it?
I'll call the shots. Whatever I say, goes.
I'm not interested in your money.
- Deal?
- Deal.
Lillian, where the hell are you?
I'm a basket case, and you're getting a touchup?
All right, I'm sorry.
Look, if she's still in Los Angeles, we'll find her, okay?
All right, now you just tip Mr. Upjohn, or whoever's doing you... and come home.
Lillian, I love her, too.
What I want you to do is something like this.
You know keep your arms like that, then twist something like that.
Okay, let's see.
Okay, come on.
Okay, now come out of it.
That's good. That's real good.
Come around here and get both your hands here.
Turn your body and twist it, okay?
Come straight down.
One, two...
One, two, three.
I got an idea.
Let's try another trick.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
One, two, three.
Wait, I got it.
Am I getting better?
No.
- That was good, Terry. All right.
- Wait! How do I stop?
Okay, Terry, watch.
You're looking good.
You are. You look nice. Yeah, you do.
- You planned that.
- I sure did.
Let's call it quits.
You know, things are beginning to make a lot of sense.
I can't explain it, but I think you had a lot to do with it.
You learn really fast.
How long have you been skating?
- Three weeks.
- Come on, really?
Really, I was an ice skater for years.
I won medals. Watch.
I was only 6 years old.
Come on, let's have some fun.
- Let's Cunga!
- Cunga!
Okay, my children,
J.D. is gonna take care of you once again.
We have more music at Jammer's.
Are you ready?
- What's happening, man?
- She lost her lock, man.
Wait a minute.
I think I got some in here somewhere.
Jammer's got some upstairs. Come up there.
At great inconvenience... you force me to make certain facts perfectly clear.
Am I making myself perfectly clear?
It's up here somewhere.
This place is not for sale.
We don't need another shopping mall down here.
You're the last merchant to hold out, Delany.
There's a lot of important money at stake down here.
That means big investors.
You can't stop progress.
Get out of my office.
Something's going down in there.
Some good advice:
You take the money and run.
Personally, I abhor violence.
Anything can happen, Delany.
Your insurance rating is already in the danger zone.
This place could go up in smoke anytime.
Might even be full of kids.
One can never tell about accidents.
Consider my offer. You got 48 hours.
Let's go.
Oh, God, I've never been so scared.
The piece that dude had had gotta be 2 feet long.
You guys, wait here.
Come on, Jammer, open up!
Damn!
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm thinking.
Why don't we find the others and put our heads together?
Let's go. Come on.
- Have you guys seen Terry Barkley?
- Nope.
So how you doing there, Twin Peaks?
Ready for some mountain climbing?
Terry had a really bad scene at home, and I think she might have run away.
- Did you check the bus station?
- The bus station? Please.
We'll just have to stroll along the beach until she's found.
Until she's safe in the arms of her loved ones.
We won't skate, we won't sleep, we won't eat.
- We won't eat?
- We won't eat.
Onward!
- Jammer, man, what's happening?
- Get out of the way.
Everybody out.
Jammer, you're drunk.
Damn it, didn't you hear me?
I said, everybody out! It's all over.
I'm closing this place down for good.
- I'm sorry, kids.
- Wanna drink?
I'm awful sorry.
- All right, so where are they?
- I don't know. We've looked everywhere.
Hey, C.C. What's going on, man?
Jammer closed down the rink.
He's acting crazy.
- Closed down the rink? What the hell for?
- I don't know.
- Hey, listen, you guys
- Barkley!
Look, where have you guys been?
And what's going on over at Jammer's?
Here's the deal.
We got two goons and a twerpy guy with a $600 suit on.
They want Jammer to sign the contract or they'll torch the place.
They don't even care if we're in there or not.
What about Sgt. Banner'?
He's always been straight with the boardwalk scene, right?
No cop's gonna arrest a guy with a $600 suit on.
Even if they did, there wouldn't be enough rink left to fill a shoebox.
- What about the Boogie Contest?
- Yeah, what about it?
Jammer did it for us.
He did it so no one would get hurt.
What Jammer needs is a good shyster.
Barkley's father is a shyster.
I mean, a lawyer.
- Yeah, that's right, Terry.
- Come on, help us out.
Wait, you don't know my father.
Look, I'm the runaway.
Please?
Okay, I'll do it. I'm in trouble anyway, right?
- All right!
- Great.
Captain? Yeah, this is Roger Barkley again.
I know it's late, but have you heard anything at all?
I can't stand it anymore.
Listen, she'll come along.
You know how kids are nowadays.
She's just blowing off steam.
Hi, remember me?
Thank you.
Now, before I turn you over to your father... is there anything you wanna tell me?
Pregnant?
- Mother, I've been gone overnight!
- How long does it take these days?
Ms. Barkley, I don't believe you!
All right, go on. Go see your father.
All right, thank you.
Hi, Daddy.
You finally remembered your address.
Daddy, I know it's not the right time, but I need to talk to you.
I have been worried sick, young lady.
All this talk about nobody loving you.
It's the skating, isn't it?
It's that insane disco music thing.
You're an artist, a musical genius.
And I'm not gonna have my daughter...
You do that again, I'll...
You get some sleep. Tomorrow's a big day.
Everybody will be there:
-the Music Society, the Philharmonic Club.
- I know, Daddy, but I need to ask a favor.
As long as it's not about skating or disco music.
Lillian, shut up.
Anything, sweetheart, you just name it.
I've got some friends and they need some legal advice really bad.
Have them call me at the office on Monday.
Could they call tomorrow?
I won't ask for anything else after that.
Why not invite them here?
I mean, I'm sure your father can talk to them after the recital.
For once, Lillian, you're right. Okay.
Honey, any friends of yours are friends of mine, okay?
Sweet dreams.
Look at these houses.
- Whoa, man! I wonder who lives there.
- I don't know. Probably some royal people.
You guys, behave yourselves at this party, okay?
Don't worry, I got class.
Yeah, and everything I know,
I learned from him.
- British soldiers?
- This is valet parking, dummy.
Get that heap out of here.
Deliveries are around the back.
- How about I deliver you?
- Come on, Hoppy, cool it.
Check your list for
"Robert James and friends."
Right through there.
Yeah, and don't scratch the paint, my man.
- Your wrap, sir.
- Rap?
I got no time to rap, Chief.
Catch me later, okay?
Hey, look! A grass party.
- Cut it out.
- Don't hit him.
Hey, cut it out! Act like you belong.
- Behave yourself.
- I'm well-behaved.
- Do you care for an hors d'oeuvre?
- Don't mind if I do.
- Finger sandwiches, my favorite food!
- Hey, get your own, lady!
Did you see what he did?
Give me one of those things.
You guys, a little food?
- Look at this.
- Cafeteria.
- I can't find her.
- You will. She's around.
Save some for somebody else, would you?
How nice of you to come.
Look what you made me do.
I lost my horse doovers.
Those are the guys.
- What guys?
- The guys in the skating rink.
- Where?
- Over there.
- Is Roger here?
- He's up with the musicians.
He's a little nervous, but he'll be all right.
I better get going. I'll see you later.
Sunny, those kids at the table... they were at the roller rink the other day.
Find out why they're here.
Don't cause any trouble.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated.
Thank you for coming to the final assembly... of the Barkley Baroque Society.
This will be our last formal recital for our daughter, Theresa.
She has been accepted to the Juilliard School of Music... as an Honor Student.
Gentlemen, would you take your seats?
Thank you.
And now, without further ado... the Barkley String Ensemble... featuring flautist, Theresa Barkley.
Wow, look at her, Phones.
-Isn't she beautiful?
- Come on, man, let's go.
Excuse me. Sorry, lady.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Sorry.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Get out of my lap!
Jeez, HOPPY-
Breathe through your nose, Mother.
Roger, do something!
- Roger, help me.
- Throw me a rope.
- Throw me anything.
- Here.
Get your hand under her. Push up.
Push her up, Franklin! Come on.
Come on.
Let's go! Over there.
Go around and cut them off.
Let me explain.
I'm sorry.
Let's get out of here.
Bobby, come on!
Roger, do something.
- Daddy, I--
- Roger, she was trying to tell you--
Lillian, shut up.
This lunacy. Those people in my home.
It's my home, as well, and you invited them here.
And Mr. Thatcher, our client-attorney relationship nearly ruined... because of your incredible accusations.
To say nothing of a $10 million redevelopment investment... now in jeopardy because of my daughter's harebrained scheme... to help all the unwashed in this world.
You are never to see those people again.
Did you hear that?
Daddy, I heard him threaten to burn down the roller rink... if Mr. Delany wouldn't sell.
My friends heard him, as well.
Impossible to raise children these days, Roger.
Young lady, I want an immediate apology to Mr. Thatcher.
What, you're gonna take his word over mine?
This is not a game.
Now, Theresa, the apology. Right now.
No! I'm not a child to be ordered to apologize to a thief and a liar!
Lovey, wait!
Sorry, kid, I went to Jammer's myself.
He's not pressing charges.
And the deal is legal.
He signed the contracts this afternoon.
Thanks, Danner.
It was really straight of you.
Yeah. Well, that's progress, kid.
- At least Jammer will do okay.
- Yeah, that's for sure.
- Man, he copped out on us.
- What's one more sell-out?
- Shut up!
- Phones is out of a job.
You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
None of you do.
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I bet.
What's your problem, man?
You got to take a nap in your little baby carriage?
Bobby, come on, give us some slack, will you, man?
- Did you get a hold of Terry?
- Not even her maid would talk to me.
Well, maybe it's for the best, man.
I mean, maybe she was too rich for your blood, you know?
Who's that?
It's all over.
But you're gonna be the greatest, Bobby.
The greatest.
I'd like to dedicate this next number to Jammer Delany.
- How'd you know I was here?
- I just thought you might come here.
It's all over. Jammer signed the contract.
You won't need to learn your moves since there won't be a contest.
You can tell your father that I won't be messing up his daughter's life anymore.
What the hell! Can you imagine?
What a pair.
I love you.
Dear Bobby, my parents have decided to send me back East...
to stay with an aunt, before I start Juilliard.
Before I go, I had to tell you that you're something really special.
I love you, Bobby James.
With all my heart, Terry.
- Mr. Thatcher?
- What is it?
This is Nick.
I got the kid marked, down by the water.
Stay with him.
How's it going, Bob?
How you doing, Bobby?
- What's going on, man?
- Where's Phones?
I don't know. He gave Hoppy his noise and said the world stinks. That's all I heard.
The guy's never gonna skate or listen to boogie music ever again.
Oh, no, there he is!
Can you believe it?
Crazy old Phones, man.
The guy was always recording something on this thing.
There's a lot of important money at stake down here.
- Hey, wait a minute, what is this?
- Turn it up.
Anything can happen, Delany.
Your insurance rating is already in the danger zone.
Do you believe that stuff?
Might even be full of kids.
One can never tell about accidents.
Consider my offer.
We got them! Damn, we really got them!
Phones left his tape player on and didn't even know it.
Give me the tape.
- What have we got?
- Evidence. We can kill the deal.
But who's gonna believe us?
Those guys got all the money in the world.
Hoppy, give me the keys to your old man's truck.
Okay, man, but don't eat any of those Puerto Rican guavas.
Tell Phones to throw away the robe.
Spread the word that the Boogie contest is on tonight. Let's go.
- All right!
- Big Boogie's on, man!
Put me through to Thatcher. This is Sunny.
- I think we got some trouble on this end.
- It's time to act.
God, I hate scenes like this.
Give me another tissue, Barkley.
Barkley, you're so immature.
What are you gonna do without me in New York?
I'll call home and ask for advice for the lovelorn.
Give her a month in Manhattan, she'll be giving you advice.
What does he want?
Bobby, what are you doing here?
- Let's go.
- Shall I call the police?
No, Bobby, wait.
I got all the evidence against Thatcher on Phones' tape player.
My parents will be here... What tape?
I've had just about enough of you, fella.
- Come on, let's go. I'll tell you on the way.
- Let me out!
Wait a minute. lam not leaving her alone for a moment.
Terry, come on. I'll get you for this, Bobby!
Let me out of here!
Terry, somebody, help me.
Help, Terry! Anybody, come on. Let me out!
Let me out of here!
- Come on, Jammer, don't split, man.
- We're not afraid of those guys.
- We can lick those dudes, man.
- Come on, Jammer, stay.
The tape can prove they threatened you.
All we have to do is get Sgt. Danner to listen.
- Yeah, man, it was corrosion!
- What he means is "coercion."
How will one more night hurt?
Then you can do what you want.
Everybody's been practicing all year to get ready for this thing.
Come on, Jammer, just let us hold the contest tonight.
Listen to me, all of you.
If you think that I can live with the idea... that one of you kids might get hurt by a gang of money-hungry goons... then you're in for another think!
No, sir. Not me!
I can't stand that responsibility.
I'm off to Arizona to watch the cactus grow.
That'll take forever.
So long, gang-
I'm gonna miss you all. Take care of him.
- Take care of yourself, all right?
- So long, Jammer.
Don't drink on the road.
Oh, God, I can't stand it.
I can't stand looking at your hound-dog faces.
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.
You can use the rink tonight for one more time!
One more time!
- Hey, Boss!
- Who's that?
There's Thatcher!
C.C., go to the Boardwalk, find Danner, tell him to go to the rink, okay?
Tell everybody that the contest is on tonight.
Okay, we'll meet you there.
When we get to them, spread out.
I want that tape.
- Let's get the goons with the fruit!
- Get the fruit!
- Hold them up. See you at the rink.
- Good luck, man.
Take off your skirt.
Let's get out of here.
There goes the Barkley girl. Let's cut her off.
- Now what?
- Take my hand and follow me.
It's easy for you to say.
You're headed for the Olympics.
I'm headed for broken bones.
Come on!
- Here they come!
- Come on, let's go!
Hurry UP!
Come on, move it, Sunny!
Just stay with them.
Watch out!
Head them off at the next street.
Jump it!
Get after them!
- Down here!
- Down there?
Let's go.
Let's split up.
Watch it!
All right, man. Give me five!
Hey, watch it, man!
- I think we lost them.
- Yeah, that's just great.
I don't know. I don't see them.
- See them?
- Nothing.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hey, wait a minute. There they are!
Just wait a minute.
They probably skated back to the rink.
Let's try there.
Let's catch a free ride.
Get your head down. Don't let them see you.
There they are.
- I don't know where they are.
- Here they are! Right there.
Are you all right?
- I got it.
- Hey, watch it.
Freeze!
All right, Thatcher, all right now.
I'll make you a deal.
You let the kids hold their contest... and right after it the rink is all yours, okay?
Shut up, Delany.
Chump!
- Give me the tape, kid.
- Give it to him, Bobby.
Thanks.
You want it? Come and get it.
Get the tape.
- Grab the gun!
- Keep them down.
What is this? Some new disco dance?
- Why don't you just play the tape?
- Play the tape!
All right, all right!
You listen to me.
Now, you listen to me good.
This is an infringement of my legal right, and I want my lawyer.
I want my lawyer now!
Mr. Thatcher, here I am.
Sorry it took me so long to get down here.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.
We'll discuss this later, young lady.
I want my client's immediate release from this travesty of justice.
This is an illegal kangaroo court.
It has no bearing or standard in this contractual dispute.
Play the tape.
Thatcher Industries is the sole owner of this property.
All legal papers have been filed and so noted.
And everyone on these premises is violating the trespass law.
The deed has been registered and recorded in and for the county of--
There's a lot of important money at stake down here.
Big money means big investors.
Turn that off! That's inadmissible evidence!
- Get out of my office.
Shut up.
Anything can happen, Delany.
Your insurance rating is already in the danger zone.
This place could go up in smoke anytime.
Might even be full of kids.
One can never tell about accidents.
Consider my offer. You got 48 hours.
What the hell do I pay you for?
Say something.
Well, I think that we have a clear-cut case here, Mr. Thatcher.
No doubt about it.
There's every indication that the contract... between Mr. Delany and Thatcher Industries is... in my professional opinion, unequivocally and totally... invalid.
All right, children, this is the time we've been waiting for:
the big Boogie contest!
Okay, that's it. No more calls.
We do have a winner.
Contestants, come forward, please.
For being more than just the best dancers...
for bringing inspiration and the true spirit of music...
the Roller Boogie grand award goes to:
Terry and Bobby.
Bobby, Terry's coming, man.
- You guys, let's split.
- Okay.
That time already?
I wanted you to have this.
My place is too small.
Why don't you keep it?
There's no room in the suitcase.
Do you have my new address?
Yeah, I got it.
You got mine?
It's in my flute case, so I'll see it all the time.
You're gonna be big, Bobby James.
I'll read about you in the papers someday:
"Famous skater wins gold medal."
Sure. Might even get to New York sometime.
You never know.
Never know.
Bye.

Yes?
Good day, miss. l am looking for Schneider.
Do you speak...? l am looking for a room.
Mrs. Schneider is not at home.
Have you a cigarette, darling? l am desperate!
Oh, yes.
-Yes, l think so.
-Oh, fantastic.
You're American.
Oh, God, how depressing.
You're meant to think l'm an international woman of mystery. l've been working on it like mad. l was told there might be a room to rent, here.
Not too expensive l...
...l hope.
Divine decadence.
-l'm Sally Bowles.
-l'm Brian Roberts.
Come in, Brian darling.
A fine English cigarette.
Oh, God, l've even begun to think in German.
-How long have you been here?
-Forever.
How long is that?
Almost three months. lt's the most marvelous boarding house.
Marvelous lodgers.
Everybody's broke, of course, but who isn't these days?
Now there's Fraulein Mayr, who is a masseuse...for ladies only.
And there's Fraulein Kost, who's a terribly sweet streetwalker.
Fraulein Kost, Fraulein Mayr.
Mayr tells Kost's fortune every morning. lt's always the same.
''You'll meet a strange man,'' which, under the circumstances, is a pretty safe bet.
The toilet.
Fraulein Kost's room.
Oh, you can just imagine.
Here it is, darling.
Well, what else do you need in a bedroom besides a bed?
Pupils. l've got to give English lessons to pay the rent.
Well, look, you can use my room for that.
See? Practically a suite. Come on in.
You'll adore these.
Prairie oysters, darling. lt's an egg with Worcestershire sauce, all sort of whooshed up together.
Fifty marks with breakfast, even when l'm behind on the rent.
Divine, isn't it?
-Of course, l'm hardly ever in.
-Why not?
Well, l dash all day and l work late at the Cabaret.
Now...these work instantly, even on the most sinister hangovers.
Of course, l may bring a boyfriend home occasionally, but only occasionally...
...because l do think that one ought to go to the man's room if one can. l mean, it doesn't look so much as if one expected it, does it?
Exactly. l see you've acquired a lot of worldly wisdom.
Oh, not wisdom, darling, instincts. l have ancient instincts. l have this strange, mystical...
...thatish feeling about you.
So you're moving right in, okay?
Okay.
Prairie oysters?
Cheers.
Peppermint prairie oyster?
Oh, you got the toothpaste glass.

You know, you're really very good. l know, darling, isn't it fabulous?
Listen, l want you to meet Fritz Wendel, absolutely my oldest friend in Berlin.
Brian Roberts.
He's a divine playboy, hurtling from party to party...
...seducing everyone in all directions.
You mustn't believe from Sally. l'm a most serious man of business.
Making import-export with machineries.
Listen, Fritz is crazy to improve his English...
...so he can dazzle fat American divorcees.
And l said you might deign to give him lessons.
Darling, give me one of those cigarettes.
One moment.
Oh, you've got to try one of these.
They're absolutely devastating. l'm sure they're filled with opium, or some such thing.
They make me feel wildly sensual.
Till later.
She's hot stuff, yes?
No, thank you.
Oh, you're not mistaking me.
We do not sleep on each other.
That is correct? ''On?''
''With.''
''With.''
Linken Lieselotte...
...72 kilos.
Her father, you know, is a big ambassador from Washington.
An ambassador?
Oh, yes, dear chap.
And soon, with her, l think, l am entering the high diplomatic circles.
Strict rules will be obeyed.
Sally tells me, sir, that you're from Oxford University.
A professor of language.
Well, it's, it's Cambridge, actually, and l'm...
...l'm still working for my doctor of philosophy.
That's why l'm here.
But, if you really want lessons, l'd be pleased to help.
Excellent.
Start!
For the sport! lf it's not...if it's not too expensive.
You know, business is...
...business is terrible.
The inflation, the Communists...
...the Nazis.
Soon l am with a tin cup, too...
...or l make a rich marriage.
That at least is sensible. l suppose you're wondering what l'm doing...
...working in a place like the Kit Kat Klub? lt is a rather unusual place.
That's me, darling... unusual places, unusual love affairs. l am a most strange and extraordinary person.
Now, tell me all about you. l want to hear everything.
Everything?
Absolutely everything.
Well, there's nothing very dramatic to tell.
Well, since l've been down from Cambridge, l--
Lya de Putti.
Absolutely my favorite screen siren.
Well, when l left Cambridge, l-- l'm going to be a great film star.
That is, if booze and sex don't get me first.
Do l shock you, darling?
Not a bit. l don't?
Since mother died we're even closer.
He's an ambassador, l understand.
Who told you that?
Fritz Wendel.
Oh, Fritz.
He's practically an ambassador.
Where is he now?
Oh, who knows?
Timbuctoo, outer Mongolia.
He dashes all over the globe on momentous affairs of state.
Then, you don't see much of him.
Darling, what are you talking about?
Of course l do.
He can't bear us being apart.
He's always swooping down and carrying me off for divine vacations.
The Riviera, Capri.
Have you ever slept with a dwarf?
Once, but it wasn't a lasting relationship.
Oh, l know l can sing, but what l really want to be is an actress.
Like...who is it?
Lya de Putti?
Oh, darling, come on. l could act her right off the screen. l thought you said she was your favorite.
She makes too many faces.
No, please....
We made an agreement.
Thank you.
Just you wait.
One of these days Max Reinhardt is gonna drift into the club.
Well, you never know.
That's right, you never know. lt has happened before.
What, just last week, a man who's a very good friend...
...of the head of casting for UFA asked me to sit at his table, and he's....
Come on. Come on.
Run, run!
Where?
Excuse me, miss....
Didn't you just scream?
Does my company upset you that much?
You know, sometimes l come down here and just wait. l mean, just especially.
You should try it sometime.
Me?
Yes.
Me?
-You.
-No.
Yes, you.
Go on. l couldn't possibly.
Don't be so British.
You'll feel terrific afterwards.
You know you want to.
No, l don't.
Here comes one now.
-Will you do it?
-All right.
No, not yet.
Okay, you ready?
Now. l can't promise you anything, but we can give it a try.
Darling, l want you to meet Herr Ludwig.
He's just back from Hamburg.
He lives in the room off the kitchen, and he's a marvelous publisher.
Now look, he's got this book, and it's got to be translated.
And l told him what a famous writer you are...
...and it's 50 marks. Right?
Fabulous. lt's all settled. lt will be an honor for me to associate with...
...so talented a young man of letters as Miss Bowles tells me.
This book, l assure you, is most artistic...
...most artistic and color--
Twenty-five marks in advance. Right? l think, Herr Roberts, you will find the style-- ls there any hot water left?
-Hot water?
-Yes, a little. l think you will find the style admirable...
...and the subject matter, l feel, is universal.
-Cigar?
-No, thank you.
No, you must. lt's the finest Havana. lt's a deal?
Herr Ludwig, l'm afraid that Sally's rather overestimated my powers of.... lt's a deal.
That's it.
Fifty marks. Not bad, huh?
Do you know what this artistic and colorful book's about?
No. Tell, tell. lt's pure pornography.
But of course it is, darling.
All of Herr Ludwig's books are dirty books.
What's this one called?
''Cleo, the Whip Lady.''
You lied about the hot water. l'm freezing. l'm freezing to death.
Hug me?
Tighter.
Don't be so literal.
Doesn't my body drive you wild with desire?
Doesn't it? lt's a very nice body.
Do you really think so, darling? lt does have a certain kind of style. l mean, look, it's very flat here...
...not much hips, and...
...here.... lt's a little early in the day for this sort of thing, isn't it?
Maybe you just don't sleep with girls.
You don't.
Well, listen, we're practically living together, so if you only like boys...
...l mean, l wouldn't dream of pestering you.
Well, do you sleep with girls, or don't you?
You don't ask questions like that. l do.
All right. lf you insist. l do not sleep with girls.
Let me be absolutely accurate. l've gone through the motions of sleeping with girls exactly...
...three times.
All of them disastrous.
The word for my sex life now is...
...''nil,'' or...
...as you Americans would say...
...''plenty of nuttin'''!
All right?
Why didn't you tell me in the first place?
Look, Brian.
You're absolutely my best friend.
And friends are much harder to find than lovers.
Besides, sex always screws up a friendship, anyway, if you let it.
So we won't let it.
Okay, Sally.
''You would have been, he would have been....''
Pluperfect tense.
''l have been....'' lf you did a little homework, instead of gadding about all over town....
Fraulein Schneider, there's a new pupil coming at 3:00.
-Would you show her up, please?
-Certainly.
''You had have been, l had have been....''
Future perfect.
''l shall have....''
''l shall have been.'' This English. l go now to try to pull a deal.
Or l make business soon...
...or l go as a gigolo.
''Either, or.''
''Either, or,'' l go as a gigolo.
Anyway, who is the new pupil?
Natalia Landauer.
Landauer?
Of the big department store?
A Landauer?
How did you meet a Landauer? l had a letter of introduction from England.
They invited me for coffee. lnvited you for coffee?
Landauers are enormous rich Jews.
Stinking rich, it seems.
Good. l shall make a pass after her.
What if she's...fat and hideous?
Perhaps the father will take a liking from me and give me a job. lf l marry her, a partnership perhaps. l'm not prejudiced.
Hello.
You said you wouldn't be back until 4:00. l must have a drink this instant.
The new pupil's due at any moment.
Can't the drink wait?
Oh, God, only gin.
Sally, please!
Three marks an hour. l need it.
-We need it.
-All l need is a drink!
She's young and very strictly brought up.
Look, l may have my tiny faults...
...but l'm really not planning to white slave her to Latin America.
Whose room is this, anyhow?
Sally, in all fairness--
Fairness? Who cares about fairness?
Honestly.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
-Excuse me.
-How fat?
How fat? l think the weather will be fine, isn't it true, Miss Landauer?
Fraulein Landauer.
Come in.
-Good afternoon, Fraulein Landauer.
-Good afternoon.
-How nice to see you again.
-lt's nice to see you again. lt is good, you have others.
So, we shall make a party for speaking English, yes?
Well, actually, my friends were just leaving.
No, l'm delighted to stay, Brian.
Sally, you have this appointment, don't you? l'll cancel it. l love parties.
Good, this is splendid for the practicing.
You will introduce me, please.
Yes, of course.
Herr Wendel, Fraulein Landauer.
-lt is a pleasure, miss.
-No, no, English conversation. l am so charmed, dearest miss.
And...and this...
...this is Miss Sally Bowles.
How do you do?
Bobby, a Landauer in my house.
Last summer when l....
You are all healthy, l hope. l have had a cold, but it is better now.
Good.
How sad.
A cold from the nose is most aggravating.
This was a cold of the bosom, not of the nose.
All the plegm vas here.
All the what?
Ze plegm...zat comes in the tubes. l think l'm gonna be sick.
Phlegm. ''Ph'' is always pronounced as ''f'', and...
...you don't sound...the ''g.''
Then why are they putting the ''g'', please?
That's a very good question, but...
...it's rather difficult to explain.
Try, Brian. lt's just there.
So, Mr. Professor, you do not know?
No.
Then l'm sorry, l cannot help you. lt's most amusing.
Very amusing.
Come in.
How thoughtful of you,
Fraulein Schneider.
Thank you very much.
You're most welcome, Herr Roberts.
Please.
Please, you must take a cake, dearest miss. l'm not eating between meals.
You're not eating between meals. l am eating between meals.
Thank you.
So much.
You're welcome.
Brian, Liebling, did l tell you? l saw a film the other day about syphilis. lt was too awful. l couldn't let a man touch me for a week.
Coffee? ls it true you can get it from kissing?
Oh, yes.
And your king, Henry Vlll...
...caught it from letting Cardinal Wolsey whisper in his ear.
That is not, l think, founded in fact.
But from kissing, most decidedly.
And from towels...and from cups.
And, of course, screwing.
''Screwing,'' please?
Fornication.
Fornication?
Brian, darling, what is the German word? l don't remember.
-Oh, yes....
-Oh, no.
Bumsen. lt would be the one German word you pronounce perfectly.
Well, l ought to. l spent the entire afternoon bumsening...
...like mad with some ghastly old producer...
...who promised to give me a contract.
Gin, Miss Landauer?
Fritz is overdoing it a bit, isn't he?
Natalia's very rich. Fritz is very broke.
That old heel-clicking, hand-kissing routine of his...
...isn't going to get him anywhere with her.
The only thing to do with virgins is to make a ferocious pounce. l can't imagine anyone pouncing on Natalia.
That's why it would be so effective, darling.
You are a woman of many sexual experiences, l think. l'll say, darling. Ever since l was so high, men have found me irresistible.
-Daddy was always worrying that....
-Yes?
You know.
How's the gigolo campaign going?
Terrible.
This week, already l'm giving up three dinner invitations...
...to spend 32 marks on her.
That's quite a sacrifice.
And here is the craziness. l like it.
Goddammit!
What? l think l'm falling in love with her. l'm so sorry.
So am l.
You assure me the English reader will find this...
...arousing...stimulating?
Well, l....
Yes, l...l should think so.
Look, everybody.
Positively a nun's hands, aren't they?
-You look lovely, Sally.
-Just lovely.
Thank you. Well, l'm off to the Adlon...
...to see my sexy...
...marvelous, devastating father.
-Auf wiedersehen, my darlings.
-Auf wiedersehen.
Good luck. l'm terribly sorry, but l couldn't possibly find any more of them.
Good night, and thank you so much for a delightful evening.
You're most welcome, Herr Roberts.
-Good night.
-Good night. lt really has been...sublime.
Thank you.
Dearest miss.
You see how she is with me?
You see that kiss? You see that kiss?
No, l...l was too discreet to look back. l think l go... l go crazy with the frustration.
You know, l...l kiss and inside me comes the explosion. But her?
Brian, l tell you a simple fact...
-...and l'm not boosting.
-''Boasting.''
The French women, the Swedish women, even the English...
...they go wild for my kisses, but...
...this one....
Nothing?
Nothing.
And l'm a crazy, love-sick fool.
Sally says you ought to pounce.
Pounce?
Throw her on a couch or something.
To attack Natalia? lmpossible.
Well, Sally is rather knowledgeable in these areas.
You do what Sally says and you end up, l think, in the prison cell.
-Pounce, huh?
-Pounce.
How'd it go?
Bad?
Sally, what is it? l waited at the Adlon till 10:00.
When l got back, there was this.
''Dear Sally:
''Sorry, schedule revised at last minute.
''Writing. Love.''
Well, these...these things do happen. l'm sure he had a good reason.
Ten words. Exactly.
After ten it's extra.
You see, Daddy thinks of these things. lf l had leprosy, there'd be a cable.
''Gee, kid, tough.
''Sincerely hope...nose doesn't fall off.
''Love.''
Bastard! l'll show him! l'll become a big film star.
The poor man, he tries to love me.
Perhaps he even thinks he does...
...but the real truth...
...is that he just doesn't care.
Maybe he's right.
Maybe l'm not worth caring about.
Maybe l am...just nothing. Nothing.
You're a perfectly marvelous girl.
-And beautiful.
-No.
-And talented.
-No, l'm not.
Yes, you are.
Do you really think so? l mean really?
Yes, l do.
Thank you.
''Maybe this time, l'll be lucky
''Maybe this time, he'll stay.''
Obviously those three girls...
...were just the wrong three girls.
''Maybe this time, for the first time
''Love won't hurry away.''
Doesn't my body drive you wild with desire?
''He will hold me fast
''l'll be home at last
''Not a loser anymore
''Like the last time
And the time before.
''Everybody loves a winner
''So nobody loves me.
''Lady peaceful,
Lady happy
''That's what l long to be.
''Well, all the odds are
They're in my favor
''Something's bound to begin.
''lt's gotta happen,
Happen sometime
''Maybe this time, l'll win.
''Cause everybody, they love a winner
''So nobody loves me.
''Lady peaceful,
Lady happy
''That's what l long to be.
''Well, all the odds are
They're in my favor
''Something's bound to begin.
''lt's gotta happen,
Happen sometime
''Maybe this time
''Maybe this time, l'll win.''
Hey, what's going on?
Tell him your lover is a gangster from Chicago.
-You told him?
-l did better than that. l just told him that l had the teeniest touch of syphilis.
Wait till he gets a load of what little old Elke's got.
-Landauer?
-Ja. l am grateful to you that you came to me from my call.
Don't be silly. l'm all agog.
Thank you.
-You will eat food, please?
-Thank you.
-You see, Fraulein....
-Sally.
Our acquaintance is not long, but l am choosing you...
...because l know no other young woman...
...who is giving her body frequently to men.
My English. l am rending you an embarrassment?
No, no, l'm fascinated.
Fritz Wendel has declared love for me.
At first l not taking this seriously.
He is so...
...so formal. And also l think so much...
...the gigolo who hunts for the fortune. ls that what you say?
That's what we say, all right.
Then...
...the night before yesterday...
...my parents are from the house...
...und we are seated here...
...upon my father's library sofa.
Suddenly...
...he throws aside the formalities...
-...there is fire, there is passion.
-Oh, my God...
-...he pounced!
-Please?
He made love to you.
On my father's library sofa.
Und even for that he is showing no respect. l am fighting, l'm calling out harsh words...
...but then....
May we not be frank?
Suddenly...
...all is...equal fire...
...equal passion in me.
And since then, l think only of him.
Now, is this love...
...or mere fatuation of the body?
You with so many, as you call,
''screwings''...
...shall please tell me the truth of it.
Please.
Does it really matter, as long as you're having fun?
How can you speak of ''fun''?
He has asked me to marry him.
Well, that's wonderful. Why don't you?
And say to my father that l am marrying a man who is perhaps a fortune hunter?
And a Christian, too.
Oh, this l think is...breaking his heart.
Well, in that case then, l guess you better just forget the whole thing.
Forget Fritz?
How am l ever forgetting Fritz?
Look, l really have to be running along.
Don't cry.
Oh, please, don't cry. l'm no good at all if anybody cries.
Natalia, about Fritz pouncing...
...you see, l thought.... l didn't think....
How shall so grave a problem resolve itself?
Poor thing.
You can't marry him.
You can't give him up. l don't suppose you'd ever consider seeing him on the sly, every now....
No, l didn't think so.
My God, it's enough to drive a girl into a convent.
Do they have Jewish nuns?
-Good day.
-Good day.
Please...can you wash...?
-Excuse me, miss, l think you lost this.
-What?
-l think you dropped this.
-Yes, thank you.
Can you wash my clothes...
...Monday, Tuesday? l'm sorry, l don't understand you.
Excuse me, may l help you? l want my laundry back by Tuesday.
The young lady would like her laundry back by Tuesday. l understand. lt's okay.
Thank you so much.
Maximilian von Heune.
Sally Bowles.
Do you have a cigarette? l'm absolutely desperate. l must have left mine at the club.
The Kit Kat Klub.
Divine decadence.
May l drop you somewhere? l have my car outside.
All right.
-Auf wiedersehen.
-Auf wiedersehen, darling.

''Turk's blood.'' A famous German drink. lt's divine. l'll never drink anything else.
Prost, my friend.
Prost.
Well, mes enfants, you are like me, adrift in Berlin. l think it's my duty to corrupt you.
Agreed?
Fascinating.
Let's go to the Kempinsky.
Darling, he's a baron.
He never even told me.
Class!
He must know everybody. l betcha a man like that could get me into films...
...faster than you can say
Eric von Stroheim. ln exchange for a little infidelity.
A little infidelity? ldiot!
Don't worry, l can handle him.
Trust me. Just trust me, darling.
All right, don't trust me. l had a marvelous time last night.
So did l.
Darling.
Darling.
Bri, darling, wake up.
We have a visitor. Maximilian's here.
Please, what time is it?
-Three thirty.
-l'm sorry, Brian, we're late.
Oh, darling, we had the most glorious time.
-We didn't stop laughing.
-Don't open your eyes.
Don't look! Okay. lsn't it fabulous? l feel just like Kay Francis.
Bri, why didn't you come?
We had the best time, and so much fun.
-Max really knows how to corrupt a girl.
-l try.
Not only did l get this glorious pelt, l got perfume, l got silk stockings....
And you got that funny little blue hat.
You call it funny. l think it's divine. l love it.
Oh, God, we didn't get anything for Brian. l'm afraid l had no time to have it wrapped.
Darling, isn't that beautiful?
What on earth makes you think l'd accept that?
-To give me pleasure.
-Max loves buying things.
Brian, you're a man of strong convictions.
Can we have caviar again?
But, you had it for breakfast.
Can l have it for lunch?
For lunch, for dinner, breakfast again--
Anything you want.
Drei Caviar, bitte!
That's for me. What are you having?
Oh, you should have been there.
The Nazis are just a gang of stupid hooligans, but they do serve a purpose.
Let them get rid of the Communists.
Later we'll be able to control them.
-But who exactly is ''we''?
-Germany, of course.
Hey, Max, can we go to the Bristol Bar?
-Why not?
-Oh, wonderful. l'm dying to show off my new coat. l think l could do with a drink, too.
Good. We'll make a night of it.
Or, why not a weekend?
Berlin makes strange bedfellows these days.
Some people have one people...
...some have two.
Some even....
''Two ladies
''Two ladies
''Und l'm the only man, ja.
''l like it.
''They like it.
''This two for one.

-Und he's the only man.

''But we've one thing in common.
''He
-She
-Und me

''The key
''Two ladies.

-Und l'm right.
''But there's room on the bottom lf you drop in some night.
''Und l'm the only man, ja.
''l like it.
''They like it.
''This two for one.''
-What'd he say?
-He's asking about his asthma.
Miss Bowles, in mother's room, l thought.
-Mr. Roberts, in the blue room.
-Yes, Mr. Baron.
The master says in case you have nothing to change into...
...he asked me to bring you these.
Thanks.
Come in.
No, no, help yourself. Please. l'm not quite sure, but l think they're mine.
This used to be my room before l was married.
Looks familiar.
You can at least get out of that shirt.
Try this one. Blue should be your color.
Brian, not even a sweater?
Are you still married?
Very much so.
-Where is your wife, now?
-ln Cologne.
For the culture.
She lends her support to the arts.
She in her way, l in mine.
We have quite a special understanding.
That must be useful at times.
What about these? l was right. Blue is your color.
We thought you deserted us permanently, Max.
My dear Stephanie, l would never desert you. l find it very interesting.
Your father must be a very important man, Miss Bowles.
Oh, l'll say, darling.
He's practically an ambassador.
We have the most marvelous relationship.... lnstant he can tear himself away, he dashes to wherever l am.
Oh, it's excellent, excellent.
But the food here is always good.
Excuse me, but didn't we meet with Emil Jannings at UFA last winter? l don't--
You do know Emil, don't you? l find him trés amusant.
Money.
Be careful!
Clara Bow.
-That's not Clara Bow.
-lt's early Clara Bow.
Wait, l got one. l got one.
Late Sally Bowles.
Yes, it is.
You two are marvelous.
Have you ever been to Africa?
-Where, mein Schatz?
-Africa.
Let's go, the three of us.
Smile Brian.
-Sally, you're really talented.
-What?
You're talented.
He wants to take us to Africa.
He must be insane.
More! Come on, please. More!
More, more, more! Please!
-That's all.
-More!
More, please!
More!
-Come on, Max.
-No, no. No.
Oh, please?
Oh, bravo, bravo.
The king of the jungle.
What's the matter? You all right?
You okay?
Mombasa's quite wonderful, really. l mean, the way ports are all over the world.
Sounds absolutely exotic.
All the way through Tanganyika.
Sure?
Sally, champagne?
Every now and then the train stops in the middle of nowhere...
...and right there is a family of giraffes, nibbling the trees...
...or a herd of zebra, galloping off in a cloud of dust.
And when the flamingos come in, thousands and thousands of them...
...turning the whole sky pink....
You'll be amazed when you see it.
Hey! Hey, Sally.
Are you quite comfortable?
Come on.
Sally is an endearing child.
But l must admit l find it peaceful when she's taking her nap.
To Africa.
To Africa.
''The sun on the meadow ls summery warm
''The stag in the forest runs free
''But gather together to greet the storm
''Tomorrow belongs to me.

''Tomorrow belongs to me.

''Your children have waited to see.
''The morning will come

''Tomorrow belongs to me.
''Tomorrow belongs,

''Tomorrow belongs to me.''
Do you still think you can control them?
Natalia.
Fritz, you frightened me. l'm sorry, but l must speak to you.
No, go away. Please go away. l told you not to come.
Natalia, please.
The situation is impossible.
We must not see each other anymore. ls it the money? ls it that? l did think it was the money, at first.
But not now.
Now l know that you love me. l know you are an honest man...
...who would never lie to me.
Natalia, l beg of you, marry me. l can't. ls it your parents? lsn't it? lt's not my parents. lt is me. lt is you, too.
Fritz, be careful!
What am l doing? l've never jumped on a running board before.
Are you all right?
Why won't you marry me?
Don't you see what is happening in Germany today? l'm a Jew.
You are not.
Goodbye, dear Fritz.
You, drive.
There is somebody in the way, sir.
Just drive on, idiot! l told Schneider we'd be gone for at least two months, maybe more.
She cried and cried and said she'd miss us. l think the only reason she was crying, though, was because she knew...
...she can't get 50 marks a month from anybody else...
...for this pitiful little room.
You know:
''Money makes the world go around.''
Where've you been? l've been packing for hours.
Have some champagne, darling.
Compliments of Max.
Oh, your laundry came back. lt's there on the bed.
You know Bri, it occurred to me.... l know l've handled Max brilliantly....
Enough of the African moon. l mean, it would be funny, wouldn't it, if he asked me to become...
...the next Baroness von Heune und Regensburg? l've been looking for that for months. l mean, stranger things have happened. l wouldn't dream of accepting him, of course.
For God's sake, l wish you could hear yourself sometimes. l mean, really hear yourself!
Christ!
Aren't you ever gonna stop deluding yourself?
''Handling Max!''
Behaving like some ludicrous, little, underage femme fatale!
You're about as ''fatale'' as an after-dinner mint.
Darling, we all know...
...about your vast experiences with les femmes...
...fatales, or otherwise.
Why don't you just come out with it?
You can't stand Maximilian because he's everything you're not!
He doesn't have to give English lessons for three marks an hour.
He's rich!
And he knows about life.
He doesn't read about it in books!
He's suave...
...and he's divinely sexy...
...and he really appreciates a woman.
Oh, screw Maximilian! l do.
So do l.
You two bastards!
Two?
Two?!
Shouldn't that be three?
Help us with our order.... l think your paper and your party are pure crap, sir!
What did you say? l said: That's a lot of crap!
And so are you!
He's a foreigner. l hear you took on the entire Nazi party single-handed.
Only two?
Sounds like...cigarette?
Feel up to a little surprise?
Poor thing, you're blind.
''Dear Sally and Bri....'' ln that order, please note.
''l know you will forgive me, but family affairs make it imperative...
''...for me to leave for Argentina, immediately.
''lt was fun, wasn't it?''
Signed: ''Maximilian.''
Argentina, my ass.
He also sent this.
Three hundred marks.
For the two of us.
A hundred and fifty each.
Let's see, on an hour-to-hour basis...
...that puts us on a par with Fraulein Kost.
Some gold diggers, aren't we?
Oh, Brian, l'm so sorry.
Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.
Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.
Anything the matter?
What is it? What's happened?
Goddammit, l'm gonna have a baby!
Well, aren't you gonna ask?
All right.
-Whose is it?
-l don't know. l really don't know.
-What are you going to do?
-Obviously, l can't have it.
The doctor l went to said he'll do it.
But it's expensive. He has to...
...bribe somebody or other for some kind of...
...a certificate or something.
Oh, l don't know.
Well...
...there goes my fur coat. l would like to marry you.
-Okay, a touch of toothpaste.
-Naturally.
A lot of gin.
All whooshed up together.
With this spiked prairie oyster, l thee wed.
To the future.
With any luck, l'll get a fellowship at King's.
Oh, dear, what's that?
My college at Cambridge.
-You'll absolutely love it there.
-l know l will.
-lt's crazy.
-Who?
Me. Wanting to be an actress. l guess babies love you automatically, don't they?
They don't have much of a choice.
-To you and the baby.
-To me and the baby.
Probably is yours.
But l don't suppose we'll ever know for sure.
So what?
You sure you don't mind?
Honestly?
Honestly.
Oh, Bri....
-To me and the baby.
-To you and the baby.
To you. You.
Me? To me.
And the baby.
-Oh, where are you going?
-l'll be right back.
You are a most strange and extraordinary person. l know, l know.
The proud father.
Good lord, Fritz.
You're on time. l can't believe it.
How's Natalia?
Please, l do not speak of Natalia.
As bad as that?
Bad.
Perhaps l cut myself at the throat.
Prepositions, Fritz, prepositions.
''ln the throat?''
No, just ''cut my throat.'' l assure you...
...they're all in it together. lf all the Jews are bankers, then how can they be Communists, too?
Subtle...
...very subtle, Fraulein Kost. lf they can't destroy us one way...
...they try the other.
You don't really believe that, do you?
But you read it every day in the Volkischer Beobachter.
That ridiculous Nazi tripe! lt is an established fact, Herr Roberts...
...that there exists a well-organized international conspiracy...
...of Jewish bankers and Communists. lt's also an established fact, that there exists...
...another well-organized group, of which you're obviously a member.
The lnternational Conspiracy of Horses' Asses. l wish the Kaiser was back. ln those days we had order. l expect Schneider will raise my rent after that little exhibition.
Oh, well, what the hell.
Let's get on with these prepositions.
What a black day l'm meeting that girl! l...l thought you loved her.
Love, love, who's needing verdammtes love?
You want to hear the big joke on me?
You want to hear it? l am a Jew.
So?
To be a Jew in Germany?
Only a fool is this, l think.
So...
...l come to Berlin and l'm not a Jew.
How did you manage that?
Where it says on my papers ''religion''...
...l am writing...''Protestant.''
So, the work comes.
The friends come.
The parties come.
Parties.
Whoever dreams that l shall fall in love with a Jewish girl?
But surely that solves your problem.
-All you've got to do is tell her--
-Do you understand nothing?
This girl!
Do you know what she has done to me? lt's terrible!
She has turned me into an honest man.
''Oh, you're good,'' she says.
''A man of integrity, who will never lie to me.''
What does she do if l tell her now? l tell you what she does, if l tell her now.
She kicks me out into the streets.
Don't be silly! She'd understand.
Anyway, what have you got to lose?
What do l lose?
She kicks me out into the streets.
All my friends hear l'm a Jew, they kick me out into the streets.
And then, l think, comes a big Nazi with a club and bangs me on the head.
Fritz, l really think you're underestimating Natalia.
What am l doing? l don't like whiskey.
Look, just tell her.
No, l can't, l can't.
What a coward am l.
''l know what you're thinking.
''You wonder why l chose her
''Out of all the ladies in the world.
''lt's just a first impression.
''What good's a first impression?
''lf you knew her like l do
''lt would change your point of view.
''lf you could see her through my eyes
''You wouldn't wonder at all.
''lf you could see her through my eyes
''l guarantee you would fall like l did.
''When we're in public together
''l hear society moan
''But if they could see her through my eyes
''Maybe they'd leave us alone.
''How can l speak of her virtues
''l don't know where to begin.
''She's clever,
She's smart
''She reads music.
''She doesn't smoke or drink gin like l do
''Yet when we're walking together
''They sneer if l'm holding her hand
''But if they could see her through my eyes
''Maybe they'd all understand.
''Why don't they leave us alone?''
Meine Damen und Herren, mesdames et messieurs...
...ladies und gentlemen...
...l ask you...
...is it a crime to fall in love?
Can one ever choose where the heart leads us?
All we ask is that you understand.
A little understanding.
Why can't the world live and let live?
Live und let live.
''Oh, l understand your objection
''l grant you the problem's not small
''But if you could see her
''Through my eyes
''She wouldn't look Jewish at all.'' l'm a Jew.
Brian, anything wrong?
Lazy that's all.
That's all?
That's all.
Look what l found.
See?
We must be lucky.
Will you still love me when l'm blown up like a balloon?
Will my body drive you wild with desire?
Sure. Why not?
Oh, Bri, it's fantastic, isn't it?
Just think:
Your life and my life...
...solved in one fell swoop.
And all by the baby! l guess it's just about the most significant baby the world has ever known...
...since Jesus. lt'll be a most strange and extraordinary baby, won't it?
Good morning, darling.
Darling, would you mind seeing if there's a bit of brandy left?
Put an egg in it, and we'll call it breakfast. l suppose you wonder what on earth happened to me? l'm afraid we made a night of it.
Where's your fur coat?
You did it, didn't you?
Did what, darling?
The abortion. ln God's name...
...why?
One of my whims? ls that all you can say?
''One of my whims?''
What right...? lf you wanna hit me, why don't you just hit me?
But you wanted it.
Didn't you?
Me and the baby. l suppose Max Reinhardt did show up at the club.
Or was it a friend of a friend of a friend of...
...an assistant director who said he'd try to squeeze you into the chorus line?
That is, of course, if you...
...if you went to bed with him.
-You think that?
-Yes.
Well then, it's just as well, isn't it?
For you, for everyone.
And, darling, would you be an angel and just let me get some sleep?
Tell me why you did it.
What is there to say?
You've said it all in one way or another.
Sally, please. l have to know.
Okay. l'm self-centered, inconsiderate...
...and what was the third adjective?
Oh, yes.
And l have this infantile fantasy...
...that one day l'll amount to something as an actress.
A dinky little cottage in Cambridge?
A playpen in the bedroom, diapers on the towel rack....
How soon would it be before we started hating each other?
How soon would it be before l started dashing out...
...disgracing myself at some nearest pub?
And how soon would it be before...?
Before?
Say it.
Go on!
You might as well, now.
Forget it.
Just forget it. l see. l really do love you.
Yes. Yes, l think...
...l think you do love me.
You...you all right? ls there anything l can...
...do for you? l just think l should sleep a little while.
Oh, shit!
Magazines?
No. lt's a long trip.
Chocolate?
No.
-We seem to be here.
-Yes. l'd love to come down on the platform with you...
...and wave a tiny, white handkerchief etcetera...
...but there is that interview. lt may not amount to anything...
...but you never know.
Shocking. l'll see you.
Meine Damen und Herren, mesdames et messieurs...
...ladies und gentlemen...
...l give you that international zensation...
...Fraulein Sally Bowles.
''What good is sitting alone in your room?
''Come hear the music play
''Life is a cabaret, old chum
''Come to the cabaret.
''Put down the knitting
The book and the broom
''lt's time for a holiday
''Life is a cabaret, old chum
''Come to the cabaret.
''Come taste the wine
''Come hear the band
''Come blow your horn
Start celebrating
''Right this way, your table's waiting.
''What good's permitting
Some prophet of doom
''To wipe every smile away
''Life is a cabaret, old chum
''So, come to the cabaret!
''l used to have a girlfriend
Known as Elsie.
''With whom l shared
Four sordid rooms in Chelsea.
''She wasn't what you'd call
A blushing flower
''As a matter of fact
She rented by the hour.
''The day she died
The neighbors came to snicker.
''Well, that's what comes
Of too much pills and liquor.
''But when l saw her
Laid out like a queen
''She was the happiest corpse l'd ever seen.
''l think of Elsie to this very day

She'd turn to me and say
''What good is sitting
All alone in your room?
''Come hear the music play
''Life is a cabaret, old chum
''Come to the cabaret!
''And as for me
''And as for me

Meine Damen und Herren, mesdames et messieurs...
...ladies and gentlemen.
Where are your troubles now?
Forgotten? l told you so.
We have no troubles, here.
Here, life is beautiful.
The girls are beautiful.
Even the orchestra is beautiful.
"Jack lifted the lid of the great stone oven and dropped inside.
"From his hiding place he heard a mighty rumbling voice.
"Fee, fie, foe, fum.
"I smell the blood of an Englishman.
"Be he alive or be he dead.
"I'll grind his bones to make my bread!"
Whoa, pony!
Hello, love.
What have you got?
Peter called while you were out.
He left this for you.
Tour dates.
This is tomorrow...
Good evening.
The Song Remains The Same.
It's fucking true!
It comes only suddenly inside the building.
No, no, man. You know, one of those...
- Are they good?
- No, they're fucking terrible!
Those photos.
- Not again.
- They're very sexual.
I think we ought to be part of it.
When you give him a call, nobody knows.
This is a song that sometimes takes a building...
...in a manner which our forefathers were very used to.
Did you hear that?
It's right though, isn't it?
That feeling that's left everybody.
The cosmic energy!
Everybody cheers.
Jimmy Page, guitar.
Not fast enough.
This is called No Quarter.
Don't fucking talk to me. It's my bloody act. I think I'll leave you anytime.
You couldn't even give them a starting line.
Are you telling me you let...
It wouldn't happen in Europe!
I don't know how the guy got in the building.
This isn't Europe or England.
I can see that. You're so inefficient!
- Somebody got it.
- Talk to me.
I'm the manager for this group.
You had people inside this building selling posters...
...and you didn't know about it!
I didn't know about it. As soon as we found out about it, we stopped it.
As soon as we found out about it and told you, you stopped it!
All right, so you found out before I did.
How much kickback are you getting?
None. I knew nothing about it.
Come on! You don't know what the concession is?
Your mate's selling the T-shirts and making the deals.
And he told Richard about it also.
He came back, didn't he?
He does everything, doesn't he?
He does the security one night...
One night he's the guard of the fucking dressing room.
That's fucking typical, isn't it?
As long as we screw an extra few bob out of the group...
You really think I get something out of it?
You are the fucking controller!
That's like saying that anyone who jumps on the stage, I'm responsible for, too.
Of course not. You're responsible to see that the concessionaire...
You rented it. You controlled it.
Isn't selling fucking pirate posters.
You have to wait for someone else to tell you what it's doing.
It doesn't matter so long as there's an extra nickel to be drained.
By exploiting Led Zeppelin, it's great.
With the fucking Stars and Stripes behind it.
We never took a dime in concession yet.
On anything.
This is called The Song Remains The Same.
Any tickets for sale?
Any tickets for sale?
How many guys out there?
Two now.
We're in good shape. Only two.
Can we get in?
- Ask these guys. They're in charge.
- Can we get in?
If it's up to me, yeah.
Thank you!
Hey, thanks a lot!
A lot of fun!
Jimmy Page, electric guitar.
Do you expect trouble?
No comment.
That's all you're going to get.
No comment is more incriminating than a comment.
- Is it?
- Yes.
No comment.
I think this is a song of hope.
Our percussionist, John Bonham.
Moby Dick.
One hundred thirty pounds of glory,
John Bonham!
Led Zeppelin's road manager says
he put the money in the deposit box...
... and when he went back it was all gone.
The police say there was money in the box,
but they can't tell exactly how much.
The group's personal manager, Peter Grant,
discussed the theft...
... at a news conference today.
It's brought back by our attorney, physically carried...
...because that's his function...
...and when he comes back...
...it's put into a safe-deposit box.
Police said they were questioning anyone
who had access to the safe-deposit box...
... but that's all they would say.
The money is reportedly the largest amount ever taken...
...from a hotel safe-deposit box in New York City.
We asked the client, there wasn't money in the box.
Probably one of his clerks.
He noted one of the transactions.
Today was our leaving day, anyhow, so we had that amount of money...
...because we had to pay our airplanes and hotels.
After he met with newsmen,
police took Grant himself...
... and two of his employees
to the precinct for questioning.
New York, goodbye.
I got a blind date
Waiting to call on me
Any minute now
I got a blind date
What am I gonna see?
Any minute now
Right over there's the doorway
He will be walking through
Will he be 6 foot 8
Or only 4 foot 2?
It could happen!
I got a blind date
Waiting to come around
Any minute now
Oy, but I'm nervous
Listen to my heart pound
What do I need this headache?
Single is not a crime
I got a blind date
And with my luck
He'll come on time
I got a girlfriend, Shirley
Who says, "Why not?"
She's an idiot
This guy's a friend from a friend
Of a friend she got
What an idiot
What do I need from Shirley?
Her and her 50 cup
I got a blind date
And I'm praying
He stands me up
What am I praying he stands me up?
I'll stand him up.
I'm gonna hide under the bed.
He'll never see me.
He'll go away, and that's the end of that. Perfect!
You keep quiet, not a word.
You didn't see a thing.
Oh, there he is.
Okay, quiet everybody, quiet!
Rosalie? She doesn't seem to be here.
That's never happened to me before.
It worked! He never saw me.
Boy, am I lucky.
I didn't see him neither.
But I can imagine what a lox that one was.
- Wait, that not right?
- He looks like Rudolph!
- Who?
- Rudolph Valentino.
- Get away!
- That's right.
- Is this person kidding me around?
- No!
Get away.
Well, that's what happened.
I let him get away.
What'll I do now?
Maybe become a nun
That's impossible.
I'm calling Shirley
Maybe she'll bring a gun
Please, Shirley
Even if he's Lon Chaney
Fat, bald or short or tall
Having a blind date's better than
Having no date at no time
With no one at all
He's cute. Hello there!
Oh, my God! Oh, Shirley!
Thank you. I can't find him.
He said he'd be here before the finale.
He said if he could make it tonight, he'd get here before the finale.
- He'll be here. He'll be here.
- Don't get your hopes up too high.
- I really hate to see this show close.
- We'll do another one soon.
See you on the breadline.
I told you, I told you, Adele!
" I'll always love you."
He'll always love me.
Fanny...
...Nick didn't come with the flowers.
This did.
I'm afraid it's pumpkin time, princess.
Why don't you go pass out...
...the presents to the kids.
Before the booze eats its way out of the bottles.
Easy come, easy go.
Out, out! If you're gonna sob, do a single.
Anything coming up?
Anything at all?
Oh, yeah. I've auditioned for a few things.
I'm scared, Fanny.
I think I'm going to be a little too...
...distinguished to go on shaking it around, you know?
How many shows have we been in, Bobby?
- Six?
- Oh, easy.
You knew me before Nick...
...during Nick...
...after Nick.
You always do things for me.
It's time I started paying you.
- Hey, Fanny. I'm not really...
- Maybe you're not, but I am, really.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I got the willies too.
The show closing...
Can you balance a checkbook?
Now, you know, I bet I could.
If somebody showed me how.
You don't have to offer me a job.
I can't take your money.
Who's offering you money?
You think I got any money?
- We'll all be back soon, Miss Brice.
- You bet.
You better start getting the gum off the seats.
- Hey, I got a terrific idea.
- What?
Move into my place, Bobby.
No pay, but room and board.
I think we can help each other.
I mean it.
I'm gonna say something stupid.
I know a little of what you're going through. You see, I miss Nick too.
So I do know a little bit of what it's like.
It's just a matter of time, Fanny.
And Nick's pride. He will make a comeback, and when he does...
...you'll be there.
- Yeah.
I ain't going nowhere, kid.
Except home. Come on.
I'll race you.
When do you start the new Follies?
He can't raise the money, Barney.
Ziegfeld can't raise the money?
Not even from Buck?
- Things are tough.
- Even the grocer is suing us.
It'll look lousy going to court over corn flakes.
Fanny, darling, I think
I'd better make you a loan.
" Dollink," I better sell my house.
What can I get?
Not anywhere near what it's worth, with the mortgage it carries.
- What about a second mortgage?
- What about a loan?
What's the use of borrowing?
- There are Fran's holdings.
- I didn't hear it.
It's all right, please.
He'll understand.
There's an important meeting.
I do apologize, Mr. Baruch.
Excuse me, Mr. Baruch, but I bought you this milkshake.
Sorry to bust in on you like this, Miss Brice.
I hope the milkshake's not C.O.D., kid.
Now that we're all here, is there anything I can do?
Fanny, Mr. Rose is a man of many parts.
He's a champion speed-writer,
200 words a minute.
We're going over holdings.
Maybe I can be of some help.
- Do you mind?
- Why should I mind?
So, l...
I'd like to make a few suggestions.
You should take a few more losses.
These will only go lower.
So, I'd sell.
American Hide at 34, now 81 l2.
AT&T bought at 150, now 111.
Cellutex at 60, now 3.
Keep it. We shouldn't cause them more aggravation.
Cuban Sugar, from 21 to 3,
Elkhorn Coal bought at 51 l2, now 1 l8.
- Elkhorn Coal? Figures.
- Noranda Mines bought at 17, now 17.
Bought at 17, still at 17?
That's a winner.
Maracaibo Oil bought at 103, now 13l4.
Pennsylvania Coal bought at 121 l2, now 4.
Sell! Before they wipe my kid out!
Billy, did you get it?
- That sums it up.
- There's an act in there.
Now if you'd allow me to make you a loan...
- Thank you for seeing me, Barney.
- Anytime, my dear. Anytime.
Come on, Bobby.
- Nice seeing you again.
- Same here.
Listen...
...Miss Brice, hang onto that AT&T.
Believe me.
Who's the pansy?
Mr. Moore is her secretary, an old friend from the days with Nick.
She should've taken a loss.
Look at this child.
That was gorgeous!
You better get out there.
Why don't you cut a record?
Who can afford?
Where am I gonna get new material?
We should get all duded up, go around to all the spots.
Right, right. Wonderful, wonderful.
What'd she say?
It makes her mad when I let my nose drip.
So you mean anytime my nose drips...
...I have to say " Mouche mon nez"?
Fanny, really. Let's do like I said.
Go out and tour the clubs.
See if there's anything we can borrow.
This way, please.
Oh, there's Fanny Brice!
- Find out who wrote that song.
- Sure. Order me a stinger.
- Hey, Buck.
- Bobby. Fanny!
- Buck! How are they running?
- Dandy. Good to see you.
Meet Miss Norma Butler.
- Glad to meet you, Norma.
- It's a thrill to meet you.
- Nice set of beads.
- Thank you.
Fanny, I'll call you.
- Let's go, baby.
- Bye.
Hey there, Miss Brice.
How are you?
Quite an entrance.
You know how to part the waters.
Ain't difficult in a bathtub.
- Well, a small thing, but my own.
- Oh, yeah?
- Good for you.
- Hello there, Joe.
You don't remember me?
From Mr. Baruch's office. "Sell!"
Did you hang onto that AT&T?
- Oh, yeah. I did. You better be right.
- Well, I'm always right.
You got some ashes on your jacket.
When I saw you, you were working for Barney.
Respectable.
Suddenly you're in the clip business?
Not so suddenly.
I haven't worked for Mr. Baruch in years. We're just friends.
- You mind?
- No, go right ahead.
- How do you...?
- Oh, excuse me.
Oh, thank you. That's cute.
To tell you the truth...
...I knew you were in that office that day. I just wanted to meet you.
Waiter, one Scotch and water, and one stinger. What'll you have?
The drinks are on the house.
Bring me the usual.
Something you stir up in back?
- I drink celery tonic.
- Celery tonic?
- Mother said, "A boozer is a loser."
- You had a mother?
So, how'd you get from Baruch to here? And why?
- Maybe I wanted to meet girls.
- You like the girls.
Sorry I took long. The guy who wrote it runs this club.
His name's Rose.
That a fact?
Bobby, I'm sorry. You remember
Mr. Rose from Baruch's office?
Oh! Oh, yeah, sure.
I didn't recognize you without your shake.
You really write
" More Than You Know"?
I wrote it before breakfast.
"When A Woman Loves A Man" before my coffee.
I might like to record it, maybe we can get together on a second number.
I'm sure we can.
I have three numbers I think would be terrific for you.
But I promised them to Ruth Etting.
Maybe I can get one of them back.
But if I do, I'll let you have it for what Etting pays...
...which is one-third off of my price, because I like the broad.
- I feel a little sorry for her.
- Do you believe your ears?
Kid...
...new song writers pay me to record their stuff.
I ain't that new.
" More Than You Know," I don't like enough to buy, only enough to steal.
That's what I said in the first place.
" More Than You Know" is a steal.
But take it.
I wanna talk about the other number.
The one you're gonna love.
You'll love what I do for you.
When I record, it sells.
I know that. You're the greatest.
I'm lucky you know I'm alive.
But let me talk about something else.
This other number...
I believe in it so much,
I'm willing to gamble.
Record this, I'll make you full partner. I'll give you the rights.
If it sells under 100,000, we split the royalties.
It goes over, give me my full percentage.
That's before we even start talking about the really big numbers...
...which is sheet music.
So you see, it's all a steal.
- Metaphorically.
- Metaphorically?
This is a shrewd kid, Bobby.
I'll marry him.
I hate paying for material.
Even laughs in the right places.
If you get your suit cleaned, it's a match.
Ruth Etting, my ass.
Anytime I want your ass,
I'll know what to call it.
Come on, Bobby.
- I expect a lead sheet.
- Thursday.
- Can I have my cigarettes, please?
- Oh, yeah, I'm...
Ganef, huh?
Take care of yourself, will you?
That's a wonderful girl there.
Three, four...
What's with the clarinets?
It's killing the melody.
Why don't you sit over there, kid?
Everything'll be all right, you know.
Just relax, okay?
Where're we up to?
Bar what? Okay, 15.
The drums, too heavy. I don't like it.
Skinny, smoother on the drums.
- You wanna try one?
- Yeah, sure.
Why don't you see how it sounds.
I know how it sounds. Lousy.
The strings are too hot.
- What?
- The strings are too hot.
- Let me hear four bars from the top.
- Four bars from the top.
He's right, Fritz.
Bring down the strings.
Bring up the horns.
- Bring up the horns.
- Bring up the horns, boys.
Let's go for a take. Top?
Could we take that a little slower?
Ready?
Fanny Brice. " More Than You Know."
Take One.
Come in.
When did you see Billy Rose last?
Three days ago.
I don't believe it! Nobody can!
He has just announced a show starring W.C. Fields...
...Marilyn Miller, Eddie Cantor,
Bert Robbins and you.
In that order?
Well, no, actually you do get first billing.
Well, I guess I better go have a little talk with the little man.
Are you a decorator or are you a painter?
Paint the chair,
I'll hold this watch on you.
However long it takes, we'll multiply it by 200.
So we'll know how long it takes.
That's the time I pay you for.
Sure, Mr. Rose. Where do you want me to do the painting?
Right here, you thief, where
I can watch you. Got a cigarette?
- Just one second.
- Yeah, come in.
- It's a wonderful surprise.
- I'll bet.
What are you stand...?
Do it in the hall.
Do it where I can see you.
- Miss Brice.
- Painting contractor.
The chairs.
- All right, you ready?
- One second, one second.
All right, go, go.
Thieving bastards.
Gotta watch them every minute.
Well, I'm very glad that you came up here.
I'm sorry you found me like this.
I worked very late at the club.
I appreciate you're a hard worker.
What I don't appreciate is that you're a fast worker.
Where do you get the nerve, using my name in your release?
- Interested in explanations?
- In retractions.
- Maybe you'll agree to...
To be in some half-assed sandlot production...
...by a tasteless
Johnny-come-lately hustler like you?
I was a Ziegfeld star when you...
...were sweating through shorthand class!
I know where I can get $50,000 right now.
- Really?
- Yes.
If I get you, I can pull in...
...another star.
But it's you I really want.
And you can get 50,000 when Ziegfeld can't?
Hey, that ain't good enough.
- I know you can do better than that.
- Sure.
Where?
- Where?
- Where can you get the 50,000?
- Bolton.
- Buck is Ziggy's bank.
- He's mine now.
- How?
Believes in me.
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're not just a nickel-and-dime hustler.
Maybe what you are is a bigtime pimp.
Buck's got a new girl.
Does she get billing?
- She works sketches? Don't lie.
- Not yours.
- Look, Fanny, you need a show.
- Really?
Why try to scrape up an act when you can do a show?
You need me.
- Kid, you need me.
- Let me rephrase it.
- Please. Use me.
- Let me rephrase it. Don't use me.
You want me to be in your cockamamie show, you ask me nice.
Fanny, do my show.
Please.
Yeah. Please.
Because...
I need you.
- Just don't aggravate me.
- You'll do it?
- What a crummy world.
- Thattagirl. Come on.
Why don't you get a manicure?
Cost a buck.
It's not the buck.
It takes 20 minutes.
- I'm done, Mr. Rose.
- I gotta use your john.
- Yeah, well, listen...
- Hello. Is that the door to the john?
- You're Fanny! I don't believe it!
- That Fanny Brice goes to the can?
Oh, my God! I see all your shows every chance I get. I die laughing.
- Sometimes I laugh so hard that l...
- Fall right out of bed?
- Excuse me, Mr. Rose.
- Yeah, sorry.
- What have you got?
- Eight minutes.
Eight minutes per chair.
You want two coats?
That's two coats, that's 16 chairs.
Sixteen minutes times 200 is 3200 minutes.
53 hours. I'll pay cash for 45 hours.
Take it or leave it.
Sure, Mr. Rose. It's okay with me.
Glad to get the work.
And congratulations, you got a show going.
Spray 'em.
Four weeks of rehearsal, this is what you come up with?
- What do you call that step?
- That's a shim-sham.
Wonderful. I got such a headache.
What is this? Oh, that's cute. Cute.
- Mr. Rose!
- What? They're dancing.
You made 16 girls look like two.
Oy, you bring me roosters?
What are you smiling at? I hate it!
I pay this creep thousands.
To design shrouds? Put it on a horse!
- Who's that?
- One of the showgirls.
- I know. Who hired her?
- You did.
Get rid of her. What?
- About Norma's costumes...
- I'm sick about it. The director is.
- What would straighten them out?
- Money.
Can I hear the words this time?
I'd like to hear Billy Rose lyrics.
Paper, paper, paper.
There's a " D" in cardboard.
A "car" board is on the end of a car!
I like him
I know he's phony
But when they package it nice
And market it right
I buy baloney
Yes, I like him
Though I can see he's the type
I better get busy and do unto first
Before I find he's done unto me
He's mostly made of chutzpah
A fake, a con, a lie
Could be I like him, maybe
'Cause so am I
Hold it. Hold it! Hold it!
- Maybe I can help you out.
- I wish you would.
I don't think they understand what you're talking about.
Kids, Mr. Rose is a very fine lyricist, an artist.
He has great respect for the written word.
And I think he wants you to articulate his artistry.
This girl didn't get to where she got from not understanding what I say.
You want me to show you?
Hey, Freddie, one, two, three, four.
I like her
I think she's funny
And we've a mutual interest
Deep down inside
Money
Yes, I like her
Although it's true she's the type
You'd better get busy
And do unto first
Before you find she's done unto you
I'm certain there's a Fanny
You seldom get to see
Whoever that is
Maybe she'll like me
You know, you'd better learn to be a little nicer.
Otherwise, those kids are gonna walk out on you.
Where do you read that crap?
Take five.
Not now, Bobby. I know. Yeah.
- Have you seen Norma?
- Oh, no.
Bucky! Bucky. Oh, these costumes are just beautiful.
Cliff, are you ready to start the technical rehearsal yet? Cliff!
- You don't think a moose gets a laugh?
- It's a buffalo.
I can get a laugh without a moose or whatever else.
Without tons of scenery. The thing is over-produced. You're dripping.
Screw it. The moose is funny and he stays. I'm the producer.
You do your job, I'll do mine.
I thought I hired a press agent.
Where have you been?
What's the problem?
Have we got any press coming from New York?
No, Billy. Just the locals, and that's bad enough.
That's funny? Get out of here.
- He got a name?
- Charles. His name is Charles.
- This moose is gonna get a big laugh.
- Buffalo.
Watch your cues, Charles.
You step on a line, it's open season.
- I'm so nervous!
- Break a leg.
Wait, I have an entrance.
My hat! Please, I have a cue.
Where's Norma?
Tell that idiot to slow down!
What the hell is happening here?
What's happening? What are you doing?
- Schmuck, what are you doing?
- I'm trying!
I'm doing my best, sweetheart.
Oh, God, wait'll I get my hands on that little putz!
Fifty million Frenchmen
Can't be wrong
When they go
Ohh la la, la la la la
On the bully boulevard
Let's hope this one goes better.
You're whistling in the dressing room?
Keep it going. Keep going.
Is this producer nuts?
We need an army to move this.
Keep going. Just keep going,
I don't care how long.
"You do your job, I'll do mine."
What crap! Get out!
If you'd sing like you yell, we'd have a hit.
- I'll give you a hit.
- Dress, Fanny.
Listen, we had a little technical trouble in the first half.
The trouble is that we got an amateur producer.
Get out of this room, you little bum.
Throw him out.
Get Bobby to throw this bum out.
If you're gonna have me thrown out, it won't be by your pet poodle.
Lovely, darling.
A trifle slow in the beginning.
The buses stopped running and we got an act to go.
- They adore it.
- They love it.
Five minutes.
Second act in five minutes.
Get out!
Billy, I'd like to talk to you about a tiny cut.
Would you look at this place?
Drops the shells all over the floor.
Keep singing, keep singing.
Hit the rain.
Boys, come back. It's only water!
Just keep playing.
Thank you, mister.
- What's that?
- The reviews.
- Of what?
- The first act.
Thank God they didn't stick around.
There are 10 people out there.
I'm going to lay them in the aisles.
Fanny?
- Get me the house detective!
- It's me!
- Are you crazy?
- It's only a joke. It's only a joke.
It's me. I got those tickets.
We're rehearsing.
- You idiot!
- Charades.
I'll call you later. Right, goodbye.
Are you some kind of break-and-enter artist?
You wouldn't let me in.
I borrowed a key.
You gave me a heart attack!
- I'll tell you how we fix the show.
- We?!
Mr. Rose, I have been through burlesque, Ziegfeld...
...childbirth, divorce, the Crash.
Last year I saw my daughter ride in a pony show.
I've also been kicked in the ass by a horse.
But I've never been through anything like last night.
- I know. I know.
- What?
- Look, we got a few weak spots.
- Buffalo shit!
- Look...
- Get out!
Childbirth, was that easy?
Like pushing a piano through a transom.
- We gotta push this one through.
- You push this one.
8 a.m., I call my lawyers. Out!
All right.
All right, all right, all right.
Goddamn it.
What is the matter with you?
I might as well tell you the whole mess, Fanny.
What?
Wasn't just Bucky's money.
I spent that weeks ago.
I needed some more so I...
...I had to borrow from the boys, and it's gone too.
- They'll build me into the highway.
- That's good news.
- I'm not kidding.
- I'm not either.
I'm into them bad.
They're gonna come for me.
Oh, God, they're gonna come for me.
They'll come for me.
You borrowed money with no backup?
- Yep.
- You must be smoky in the head.
Look, you gotta help me, please.
I know I can fix the show.
Please, I can fix it. Give it to me.
Bucky'll stay in.
If you stay, I know I can fix it.
What happened was mostly my fault.
You were right about everything.
The sets, the costumes.
Charles? Everything.
But the songs are good.
I'll get some dancers to back up Bert.
And the sketches, they're good.
They're swamped by your damn production.
Teach me. I can learn.
I learn it faster than anybody.
- You need a show.
- You gonna start that again?
I don't need you. I'm a star.
Listen. Come on, Fanny.
- Where you gonna get some more dough?
- Same place I got it before.
Why not?
You get knocked off, you might as well do it for a good sum.
- Let me take a look at this.
- Ow! What are you, nuts?
Why don't you get some sleep.
Why are you up? It's 4 a.m.
You must be crazy, I'll tell you.
- Go to sleep.
Give me the key. The key.
- I'll return it.
- Give me the key.
Thanks.
Go to sleep. It's 4:00.
Billy...
...you think you can get your friends to take Charles for a ride?
You gotta dump two-thirds of the set.
Simplify the orchestrations.
The Spanish number.
Cut the gypsies and the campfire.
Did you ever hear of "in one"?
A curtain and me.
See, I come out,
and I'm Martha Graham.
You see, Billy, in a tutu,
I can be funny.
If Little Eva was Jewish,
maybe funny.
- Time for us to part
- I'll be twinkling
So long, honey lamb
I'll be keeping you
Right here in my heart
Watch me winkling
Think of this as temporary
Just a toodle-loo
Toodle-Ioo to you too!
Oh, God, was that a note!
It was given to me by my friend
Grace Moore on my birthday.
Oy, was she glad to get rid of it.
I gotta have more in the second act,
a new number.
What about Bert's number
"Clap Hands"? Where are the hands?
- Another number that's gonna work.
- It's working now.
It's almost working.
Get the sequins off the gloves.
Hey, Clark, get the goddamn sequins off the gloves!
Hey, Clark, get the goddamn sequins off the gloves!
Yeah, listen, what can I tell you?
He's a maniac.
Listen, I didn't invent them.
I'm just his press agent.
- Did you call Buffalo?
- I'm on it.
Sorry, this evening's performance is sold out.
Hey, we're sold out tonight?
Hey, you hear? We're sold out.
We're sold out. We're sold out.
We're sold out. Hey!
- Let's make this the last one.
- Watch the silk.
We're SRO tonight.
We're SRO tomorrow night.
Here's the picture.
I'll take a celery tonic out of your shoe.
Not from this shoe. This is a custom-made shoe. Give me my shoe.
Give me something.
Give me a nice tooth.
You got a nice tooth.
Give me an earring.
Give me your hand.
Get up off the floor.
You'll ruin your pants.
It's a new act. Brice and Rose.
We go through life together.
You better do a job on the four-sheets.
You have to see it on an outhouse wall 200 yards away...
...going 60 miles an hour.
No fine print.
All that matters is, can they see it?
Yellow and black.
You got it? Good.
You're such a slob.
Why do you drop your shells?
I gave you good advice.
I hope you got it.
- When I got you, I got it all.
- Are you crazy?
What? Nobody can touch a star?
Stop that! I don't like being handled.
Is that right?
- Is that right?
- Stop that!
I am sorry, I really am.
I'm so sorry. Billy, please.
Can I help you brush your coat off?
Billy, I just grabbed the first thing.
I grabbed the first thing.
Look, look.
When we get into New York, I don't want posters, I want billboards.
I want you to blanket Times Square.
And full page ads in the Times.
Got that? In the Times.
And I want plugs from Winchell.
You don't know what a billboard is gonna cost.
What are you, a banker?
Give me a cigarette.
We'll bring in a hit.
He's out there!
He's with some 18-year-old, but he's out there.
Get me out of this!
He'll be here in two minutes.
I don't wanna wear that black thing.
No, I hate it!
You gotta put something on.
- Fanny.
- What?
- He's coming!
- Is he alone?
He ditched her! Quick, open the door!
Oh, this goddamn makeup!
Jesus, I got a run in my stockings.
Hello, Fanny.
Why, Nick, how good it is to see you.
All the world changes but you.
Over a year I've been practising that line.
You want a drink or something?
You want a cigarette?
I'll call Adele. What do you want?
I don't want a drink, and I don't want Adele.
Is that for me?
Don't open it now.
Fanny, I...
When you're a star, everything you do is magic.
You don't have to entertain me, Fanny.
It isn't necessary.
- I can't say how good it is to see you.
- Try.
Wait a minute.
I gotta do my number first, okay?
Explain to me why I can't remember one thing I was gonna say.
I'll remember my lines if I just don't have to look at you.
I'll remember.
- Fanny, I want to talk to you.
- You don't have lines here. My turn.
Nicky Arnstein, I love you so much.
I don't blame you for divorcing me.
You got hit by this steam engine the papers called Fanny Brice.
By this made-up person the papers made up.
And I can understand how you really had to dig yourself out. I really can.
But I want to get off, Nicky.
I just want to climb into your back pocket and stay there.
- Fanny.
- Just stay there all the time.
You're married.
I just didn't know how to tell you.
- When?
- Three months ago.
To that girl?
That beautiful girl I saw you sitting next to tonight?
My wife was sitting on my other side.
That old lady?
She's 43.
Forty-three and loaded, right?
I'll always love you very much, Fanny.
Who's that?
We just wanted to congratulate her.
Miss Brice isn't dressed yet.
She all right?
She said you should go on to the party without her.
Take it. Go ahead.
It's for you.
- She's from Philadelphia. Here, Adele.
- Thanks.
She's got $12 million.
She has an apartment in Paris, a house in Antibes.
And she's got a yacht.
So Nick can teach her how to be Ionely in all of them.
Opening night present.
He must've spent a whole week's allowance.
Hey, did you see that?
It came wrapped around the record.
Yeah, from the company.
Boy, it's been a swell opening night.
Fanny...
...I'm sorry.
I know you are, kid.
Go to the party without me.
I'll be along later.
I just want a few minutes.
You too, Adele.
Why don't you just shut up!
Ain't she got fun
She's the luckiest one
Satin on my shoulder
And a smile on my lips
How lucky can you get?
Money in my pocket
Right at my fingertips
How lucky can you get?
Every night a party
Where the fun never ends
You can circle the globe
With my circle of friends
Someone I am crazy for
Is crazy for me
I'm his personal pet
Wow, how lucky can you get?
Wrap it up and charge it
That's my favourite phrase
How lucky can you get?
When I see the chauffeur
Think I'll give him a raise
How lucky can you get?
Weekends in the country
With a baron of course
And a wardrobe to choke
Mrs. Astor's pet horse
Making merry music
With the one that I love
We're a perfect duet
Can you get!
Satin on my shoulder
How lucky can you get?
Money in my pocket
How lucky can you get?
Every night's a party
Where the fun never ends
You can circle the globe
With my circle of friends
Someone I am crazy for
Is crazy for me
I'm his personal pet
Wow, how lucky can you get?
Hey there, gorgeous
Big success
What's your secret, gorgeous
Just lucky I guess
You want to know what it's really like?
Fantastic.
Satin on my shoulder
And a smile on my lips
Money in my pocket
Right at my fingertips
Wrap it up and charge it
That's my favourite phrase
When I see the chauffeur
Think I'll give him a raise
Life's a bed of roses
Squirting perfume on me
You can spare me the blues
I don't sing in that key
And if there's a man
Who'd leave me
I am happy to say
I haven't run into him yet
Gee, whee, wow!
How lucky
How lucky can you get?
Look, just look at that.
It's worse than ever.
Fanny? Fanny.
- Oh, my God, look! Is that Buck?
- No, C.V. Silverstein.
Silverstein from the Silverstein Movie Studios?
Come visit me in California.
Hey, push off with Bobby.
I wanna talk to Fanny.
Alone for once, okay?
Come on, I wanna show you something. Come on.
48th and 10th.
It's a theatre-cabaret.
I'm gonna call it the Casa Mañana.
That's Mex for " House of Tomorrow."
What, you gonna play a fair in Texas?
You already got our show.
They'll pay me 100,000 bucks.
It's a big deal, the Texas Centennial.
It's nice.
Here, look.
Classy, huh?
- Too classy?
- Too classy for what? Buffalos?
I got some fan dancers.
- How you fixed for feathers?
- You're always on the hustle, Billy.
So how long are you gonna be down there?
Why, what do you care?
I'm used to you.
You're good for laughs.
It's hot in here.
This thing's gotta be a spectacle.
I'm gonna get 50 girls in here.
They're all gonna be 5'10" or bigger.
And, the closing number,
I was thinking of all white.
Maybe a wedding routine.
Very impressive.
How'd you like to star in a wedding bit?
I paid retail.
You want the goddamn ring or not?
Speak up, I got a rehearsal.
- You're asking me to marry you?
- Yeah.
- I mean serious?
- Yeah!
And I'm not gonna ask you again.
So right now, yes or no? Yes or no?
It ought to work out fine.
You saying yeah?
I'm saying yeah.
I got a little confession to make.
I never borrowed money from the mob, like I told you.
You bastard.
Making me think they had you on ice.
It was a very good argument.
You bought it.
Only by now, you should know better.
I wouldn't want you to think you married dumb.
Darling...
...I do adore you.
But you are absolutely mad.
Tell me, why him?
I fell in like with him.
Do you have a light?
Here.
Oh! Did you see what that man did?
It is a crunch.
My wife, however, is determined to speak to Miss Brice.
- Do you know her?
- I married her.
Of course. You must be...
Rose. Billy Rose. Rose.
- Crude little bastard.
- Screw him, he's only in on a pass.
- Have a nice evening, Mr. Brice.
- Rose.
No action in the club car?
How many times I gotta tell you that I am not a gambler?
- Did you do your knees yet?
- No, I'm coming to them.
I thought you did your knees before your heels.
I do the heels first.
Then I do the knees.
- Every night.
- Every night.
By the time you finish that production, I get all mixed up.
Mixed up what?
I don't know what I should go for.
I figure, maybe there's something I don't know about.
Maybe I'm supposed to go do something to your goddamn knees or heels.
You put perfume behind your knees?
- You never did that before.
- Yes, I did.
Maybe I'm right.
I should go for your knees?
Will you forget about the knees?
We're gonna arrive in Fort Worth at 7 a.m. Let's get some sleep.
The heels before the knees.
The knees after the heels, before the elbows.
After the knees.
Hang up your pants. You'll get there looking like two bits.
- I'll get them pressed.
- Why not just hang them up?
Did Nick always hang up his pants?
- Yes.
- I'll pay the buck.
Flinging your clothes makes the room look like a dump.
I've never been in a train for three days with goddamn royalty. Here!
How come you never go to the can?
In the theatre you used to.
It's none of your damn business.
How come now we're married...
...and you never go to the can?!
How do you think I feel having to go to the can all the time?
You don't like being cooped up with me...
...there's an empty compartment.
Hire it.
I won't have to look at your crummy pajamas.
What's wrong with them?
I hate your pajamas! They're terrible.
Well, I hate your lemons!
And I hate your fancy bed junk!
And where, where, tell me, where...
...do you come off reading a French magazine on our honeymoon?
I know you can't read French!
I look at the pictures, creep!
I learn what goes!
One thing that'll never go is your pajamas!
Screw my pajamas! Screw them!
And screw you, lady! And...
- What?
- Oh, God...
What's the matter?
Gave me a nosebleed.
You gave me a goddamn nosebleed.
Hold it, hold it, there.
I'll get some ice.
Okay, here.
If you bleed on my good gown...
When I stop, I'm gonna belt you one.
Tough guy.
Kid, you are some nut.
Let me see.
- Just lie still.
- You know the trouble, Fanny?
The trouble is that I love you.
I love you.
You could've told me. Put your best foot forward for the hell of it.
I'm gonna take you to Sulka's and have some pajamas made for you.
- They'll make pajamas for you?
- Sure.
Just like shirts.
They make underwear too so it fits.
You ain't getting me measured for no BVDs.
Pajamas maybe, but no BVDs.
Okay, okay. Go back to sleep.
Billy. Billy! Shirley, will you get me that clipping, please?
Would you let me read it to you first, then blow your stack?
Okay. Shirley?
" Miracle Man of Broadway Billy Rose's beauteous Aqua Belle...
...Eleanor Holm sings Circe songs to Billy in Cleveland.
Are you listening, Billy?
Fanny, are you listening to Billy?
Five years, five hits.
Is this your first miss?" Burn it.
No, I can't kill a Winchell item, Billy. You know that.
Well, what I can do is to prevent anybody else from running with it!
You think I don't know how sore she'll be when she finds out?
I'm close enough to get grabbed!
The proofs.
His name should be in another colour.
Billy, what can I do?
- Ned, did you order a sandwich?
- Yes.
You and Fanny wave to each other every six months from separate trains.
How can I publicize that?
What should I do?
You want me to stage something on the tracks...
...where she flings your slippers after you as you whiz by?
Ned, it's Miss Brice.
Billy, Fanny's on the other phone.
Tell him about the Hippodrome.
I'm on the wire to Billy.
He says he's very Ionely out there.
The accountant thinks you better...
I saw the poster, what about it?
You want to kill the kid costume?
Okay.
We get out a flood of releases that you also sing.
Big news. But if that's what you want, you got it.
Hey, you wanna talk to Billy?
Hold on a minute.
Billy, talk to your wife for a minute.
She's leaving for California tomorrow.
Okay, go ahead.
You'll knock them dead.
I could use your advice.
- I could use your advice.
- What about? "Circe songs?"
Don't listen, kid.
Put cotton in your ears.
- Okay. Fran sends you her love.
- Give her my love. And you too, Fanny.
Hang up now, let me talk to Ned.
- Bye, good luck.
- Bye, Billy. Ned?
Yeah, Fanny? What can I do for you?
Your California train?
If it doesn't go through Cleveland, it's gotta go some place near.
Want me to check that out for you?
Sure, hold on.
No, honey, it's my pleasure.
Billy? Billy!
Beautiful, let me see that.
You gonna fly?
- Mr. Rose, let's go.
- It's about time. Would you get...?
I thought you were in California.
I thought you were in Cleveland by yourself. Introduce me.
This is the champ, Eleanor Holm.
- How do you do?
- Just call me Mrs. Rose.
As long as she doesn't call me Mr. Brice.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, my train passed through.
I got off to check him out.
How's it going?
- Places, everybody.
- Excuse me. Back to work.
Terrific break that you showed up.
You couldn't have timed it better.
I really think I got a hit. I feel it.
I'd like to see what you think.
Any advice you could give.
You look... That's terrific.
I love that suit.
You should. It cost you $200.
Mr. Rose, we need you up there.
It's all right. Don't worry about me.
Terrific. Come here.
Here, sit here.
You'll be all right?
I'll see you in a bit.
Hit the music!
Stand by.
Lights.
Presenting the Billy Rose
Aqua Belles.
Give me a little celery tonic.
Billy Rose's new star,
Miss E leanor Holm.
That's great, Billy. Terrific!
Hey, come here. You wanna dance?
Your star trout's got a lot of muscle.
Don't let her get you in the water.
Eleanor's a great kid.
You ought to get to know her.
Maybe we should have her for dinner. Amandine.
I just made a joke.
You didn't think it was funny?
No, kidding. You got a great show.
With an ace attraction. Ace.
- You shouldn't kid a kidder, Fanny.
- What?
- You performed for me tonight.
- What is that supposed to mean?
I know you. I know how you think.
When you want something, you get it by being funny.
I've seen you do that before.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
You went to a lot of trouble to make me laugh tonight.
You got a very primitive sense of humour, kid.
Pratfalls, dropped drawers, drowning bits.
You know, I got a terrific idea.
I don't know if it would work, but see what you think.
- What's on your mind, kid?
- Why don't we get married?
We got married.
No, I mean, really be married.
Really married.
Mrs. Rose is the name and chicken soup is the game. Is that what you want?
What I want is...
...I want you to do more of what you did tonight.
Brush off a broad if you think she's getting too close.
You remember a long time ago, you made me say I need you?
That's what I want.
I want you to need me.
I mean, really need me.
Need me.
You got some sexy ears, honey.
I think I'll stick diamonds in them.
I need you.
I need you.
I need you.
Life, Colliers, Esquire, Stage?
What is this?
The Saturday Evening Post?
You shouldn't get bored and pick up strange men.
Are there any other kind?
Billy, will you call me every night?
Reverse the charges, if you want.
Don't be a chump. I got a new system for beating the phone company.
All aboard.
I'm a mess, huh?
All aboard.
Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles.
I'm gonna get you a bigger ring.
- All right.
- So long, Billy.
All aboard.
Billy?
Don't go near the water.
Norma, I cancelled the Baby Snooks rehearsal to come here?
What is this?
I get paid for wearing costumes.
Stop " kwetching."
You're gonna just love it.
- We got seats next to the field.
- Hi-Ho Silverstein, right?
Oh, Fanny!
So this is Beverly Hills.
You can't catch up with the goyim.
When you think you learned it...
...they come with sticks and hookers.
- Chukkas.
- " Chukkas?"
Oh, I wish Billy was here.
Billy loves baloney.
When Norma promises you'll be excited, you'll be excited.
- You know Nick?
- Nick?
Oh, Fanny, you don't think I planned anything. He just was here.
Thank God you never had to learn to act.
I wanna know if he knows I'm here.
I'm absolutely certain he'd want to.
I'll see you kids later.
I'll send the car back.
Quit while you're ahead.
Don't try to walk on the water, kid.
Why don't you come on out here?
I'll send you a return ticket.
You want a private car? I'll give my body to Huntington Hartford. Come on.
No, I'm okay.
No, I really am.
I just miss you, kid. That's all.
Look, if I get too Ionely,
I'll send for Fran, right?
Yeah, sure.
No, don't be silly.
Of course I understand.
I'll talk to you next week, huh?
Maybe sooner.
Me too.
So long, Billy.
I'll see you.
Goddamn it!
And the thing is...
...I guess I wanna see him, talk to him.
Just do what you want!
How are you, kid?
I'm not sure.
A little nervous, I think.
Me too.
Like always.
Did you ever think about directing?
You got the wardrobe.
- You look ravishing, old girl.
- You look ravishing too.
Didn't have time to change out of your polo clothes?
Oh, yes, I had plenty of time.
I tried to decide what I should wear.
I looked in the mirror and saw how becoming this outfit was.
So I just took a shower and put on the same.
- I thought I might get by with it.
- A new trick, telling the truth.
What are you thinking?
I was just remembering...
...when I first went out with you.
I was still living home with Mama.
I used to sleep in the same bed with her, and...
...once in the middle of the night
I woke up kissing her.
Then she woke up and said,
"This ain't Nick."
That's what I was thinking.
How is your mother?
She sold the saloons.
She lives in Lakewood, New Jersey.
- She likes Billy.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Rose.
How is Mr. Rose?
He keeps busy. How about you?
When you come down off your horse?
When I come off my horse, there's the yacht and...
...a 13th-century palazzo we're rebuilding in Cap D'Antibe.
The problems of dismantling are just staggering.
I like dismantling much better than mantling.
- Still the same Fanny.
- You expecting Mrs. Roosevelt?
I was expecting Fanny.
Hoping for Fanny.
You know, Fanny, the only trouble we had was money.
That's not a problem now.
No problem for you or for your wife?
No problem for either of us.
If I walk away,
I walk away with a very large stake.
How you fixed for toothbrushes, kid?
Oh, God!
I remember that first time in Baltimore.
When I went up to your hotel room.
And I went into your bathroom.
Jesus! You had seven toothbrushes.
Seven. I guess one for every day in the week.
And you had this big wooden bowl with soap in it.
" By Appointment to His Majesty" it says on the bowl.
Royal soap. And hanging on the door were these silk pajamas.
Red, with...
...a monogram, real tiny, tiny.
That small.
Class.
Boy, did I come out of that bathroom with personality.
I was all over the place...
...because I fell in love with those toothbrushes.
Still have seven toothbrushes, Fanny.
And all these years...
...I've been in love with nothing but a set of...
...goddamn toothbrushes.
You have a daughter, you know.
You haven't seen her in six years.
And you don't even think to ask about her. You ask about Mama...
...but you don't inquire about your own daughter, you son of a bitch.
- How is Fran?
- She's great.
She keeps your picture next to her bed.
- She does? Which one?
- What do you care? They're all great.
The money trouble we had is what you thought it'd take the place of.
If you'll excuse me.
Bobby, say hi to Nick before he goes.
Just ring for your horse.
Well, I'll be damned
No I won't be damned
Because I have been damned
But I won't be damned anymore
I walked out
He didn't walk out
It was me who walked out
It was me
Closing the door
Blow the bugle
Sound the cymbal
All my troubles fill a thimble
I'm as happy as it's legal to be
Come on, kids
Let's hear it for me
Get the tom-tom
Start the drumming
Cue the chorus
Keep 'em humming
'Cause I'm climbing off
The limb of that tree
Come on, kids
Let's hear it for me
For this overwhelming sensation
I could stand a standing ovation
Give my entrance cue
To the band and
Give the little lady
A great big hand
Slide the trombone
Let it swell out
This performance is a sell-out
And the critics and the public agree
I'm the number one
Attraction to see
So applaud it and cheer it
Come on, now
Let's hear it for me
Standing in the wings
All prepared to start
U sually I'm tense
A pounding in my heart
But now I'm not afraid
Those butterflies are gone
My act is looking great
I can't wait to go on
Grab a ticket
Find your row, kid
I am strictly SRO, kid
Tell those oogly-boogly feelings
I'm free
They've been banished
By a royal decree
And your head feels so good
When you finally clear it
If I saw a worry
I wouldn't go near it
Come on, now
Come on, kids
Let's hear it
Let's hear it for me
This is WYXY Cleveland.
Here is Shep Fields
with one of your favourites.
Billy.
- Oh, Miss Brice!
- Oh, Jesus! Fanny!
So just don't lay there, honey.
Swim something.
You always were a fast dresser.
Sloppy, but fast.
Fix your tie.
Can I sit down?
Yeah, sit.
Alone at last.
That was like a crummy burlesque sketch.
I'm sorry, Fanny. I'm sorry.
You know, I flew all the way to Cleveland in a plane.
I had to get here fast so I could tell you my news.
What news?
I should have phoned.
What news?
I wanted to be with you when I told you.
It's all over with Nick.
I mean it, really over.
Look, Billy.
It's okay. You see,
I figure what happened...
...was because I called you and I wanted to see Nick...
...and you got sore at me.
You figured, screw her.
And I don't blame you.
I don't blame you. I mean it.
You're entitled.
So let's negotiate.
I'm willing to forget it if you're willing to forget it.
Fair?
I'm in trouble, right?
You really go for the trout.
I go for her, Fanny.
She's got a good shape. What else?
To her I'm Nick.
Do you love her?
I don't know.
I suppose so.
She loves me.
That's it, then. If you love her...
...there's nothing to discuss.
I'd make a clean exit, but my train doesn't leave for another hour.
I have to hang around here, so you better check out.
See you in court, kid.
Good luck, Fanny.
Good luck, Billy.
Daddy, I know how we can settle this whole thing right now.
- How?
- Let's go take a sock at them.
This was the 10th anniversary
of The Baby Snooks Show...
... from Hollywood, California.
Hurry, I got company coming.
I gotta get home and change.
Hello, Fanny.
Hello, kid.
It's been a long time, huh?
Sure has.
So, how do you think I look?
You look sensational.
You look great.
Thanks, kid.
Why don't you...?
How much did she take you for?
Oh, I can afford her.
Besides, the lady had a legitimate beef.
- You don't know your lines.
- What should I say?
Eleanor's a bitch, and you've never seen me like this.
- Seen you like what?
- Like I am, you jerk, perfect!
But I have.
I've seen you like that.
I mean, to me you always were perfect.
- So, what'll you drink?
- Celery tonic.
- How's Fran?
- Grown up.
Gorgeous. Married.
Thanks for asking, kid.
- You're still good company, Billy.
- Yeah?
If I was such good company, how come we were never alone?
Kid, we were four years married.
That's not alone?
- Remember?
- Are you kidding? One of your best.
You know what I was thinking about when I wrote that?
Nick?
That's right, Nick.
Except you.
Nick, Adele, Bobby and me.
Being married to you was like being married to a parade.
" Me and My Shadow."
You used it in Cleveland.
Let's not rehash Cleveland.
You still get high on celery tonic?
I took your advice.
I bought that company.
Now I make two cents while I enjoy.
Billy, I gotta hand it to you.
You got everything you ever went out for.
But tell me something.
You really have as much money as they say?
All it takes to make a lot of money...
...is a lot of money.
But what to do with it.
I don't worry about you.
You're resourceful.
You know, Fanny...
- I bought the Ziegfeld Theatre.
- Really?
The Ziegfeld's mine. I'll open up with the biggest show ever.
Salvador Dali to do the sets.
Stokowski in the pit.
Music by Rodgers and Hammerstein.
Sketches by Kaufman and Hart.
Costumes from Paris, the best of everything.
Real Alençon lace on the chorus girls' drawers.
That sounds great, Billy.
Who's gonna be in it?
Well, for openers, you.
Me? I knew you were on the hustle.
Look, you haven't been on a stage in years.
You're sitting out here doing that radio show.
You're getting lazy. You're a Ziegfeld star, the star of stars.
Name your figure.
I give you whatever you want.
I make a good living.
I don't need the money.
Maybe not, but you need me.
You? You I've had.
If you gotta get personal, it won't be complimentary.
Professionally, I only helped you.
In the work department,
I was good for you.
Come on, let's get together again, huh?
You know something, my timing was always off for us. It's too bad.
I just loused it all up.
You don't get all the credit.
Look, " Billy Rose presents
Fanny Brice."
I don't like the Billy.
I'll think it over.
You'll think it over?
That's what you say to me?
I haven't done anything without thinking in over 10 years.
You want to know the truth?
I was rattled as hell, you coming here tonight.
I wanted for you to come in here begging me to come back...
...so I could have the pleasure of saying no.
Taken me a long time to say no.
I wanted to practise.
That's what you're saying to me? No?
I'm saying that I'll think it over, and I'll call you.
- Think fast.
- I don't wanna. That's the point.
I'm at the Beverly Hills till day after tomorrow. So, yes or no?
So I'll call you before noon, day after tomorrow.
Make it yes.
Rose and Brice.
Brice and Rose, whatever.
We could have a terrific time.
Make it yes. Huh, Fanny?
Start the drumming
Sound the cymbal
All my worries
Fill a thimble
I need you.
So come on, kids
Let's hear it for me
'Cause now I'm not afraid
Those butterflies are gone
My act is looking great
I can't wait to go on
And on
Grab a ticket
Find your row, kid
We'll be strictly SRO, kid
And I'm glad to say
I'm finally free
Oh, your head feels so good
When you finally clear it
If I saw a worry
I wouldn't go near it
Come on, now
Let's hear it for me

SDI Media Group
The doubt while the jury is out
Or the thrill when they're reading the will
Or the chase for the man with the face
That's entertainment
The dame who is known as the flame
Of the king of an underworld ring
He's an ape who won't let her escape
That's entertainment
It might be a fight like you see on the screen
A swain getting slain for the love of a queen
Some great Shakespearean scene where a ghost and a prince meet
And everyone ends in mincemeat
The gag may be waving that flag
That began with a Mr. Cohan
Hip hooray the American way
The world is a stage
The stage is a world of entertainment
That's entertainment
Here we are!
All right.
That's entertainment
Look what I can do!
It's still me!
It's still me!
And now, as we carry right on
We call upon charming Leslie Caron
Anywhere you can watch Fred Astaire
That's entertainment
A scene played by Judy and Gene
It's a song that goes ringing along
Garbo's dance has a touch of romance
That's entertainment
"The show must go on" is the show business cry
But there's always someone who wants to know why
With Robert Taylor
I'll try to come up with an answer
It's Eleanor Powell the dancer
More
There is much more in store
The world is a stage
The stage is a world of entertainment
The bells are ringing
For me and my gal
For Me and My Gal was my first film... and, boy, was I lucky.
I co-starred with Judy Garland.
That's what I call starting at the top.
Knowing
To a wedding they're going
And for weeks they've been sewing
They've been sewing something old and something new
Sew something that is blue so they can make a trousseau for my gal
They're congregating for me and my gal
Look here!
Why, that's the parson waiting for me and my gal
And sometime
We're going to build a little home
For two
- Or three
- Or four
- Or five
- Or maybe more
Loveland for me and my gal
Fascinating rhythm, you got me on the go
Fascinating rhythm, I'm all a-quiver
Fred, I hear tap-dancing is popular again.
And here's a lady who will keep it that way. ;
Eleanor Powell.
Each morning I'm waking up
Very happy just to find that no work has been done
Once it didn't matter
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy
Won't you take a day off?
A couple of weeks
Somewhere far away off
But make it snappy
Oh, how I long to be the man that I used to be
Oh, fascinating rhythm
Won't you stop picking on me?
I've got a feeling you're fooling
I've got a notion it's make-believe and you are laughing right up your sleeve
Mr. Kelly, would you tell me a couple of things... you never expected to see?
Well, Mr. Astaire, I never expected to see
Robert Taylor singing.
Moments of paradise
You're such a standout but how you hand out that
I've got a feeling you're fooling
I've got a feeling it's all a frame
It's just a well-known old army game
No fooling
- No fooling
- No fooling
No fooling
When I'm
When I'm fooling with you
And I certainly never expected to see
Greta Garbo dancing.
Fred, I hear that since you've been a kid... you always said you wanted to be a dancing man.
No, Gene. That's not true.
I never said anything like that in my life.
I wanna be a dancing man
While I can
Gonna leave my footsteps
On the sands of time
If I never leave a dime
A dancing man
With footsteps on the sands
Of rhythm
And rhyme
A dancing man
With footsteps on the sands
Of rhythm
A song of love is a sad song
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
One of my happiest discoveries was Leslie Caron.
After An American in Paris, she starred in Lili.
A song of love is a sad song
For I have loved, and it's so
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo, Hi-Lo
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo, Hi-Lo
Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili
Hi-Lo
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
I always wanted to play a clown... and in The Pirate,
I finally got the chance... with Judy, and a terrific Cole Porter song.
Dress in huge baggy pants
And you'll ride the road to romance
A butcher or a baker ladies never embrace
A barber for a beau would be a social disgrace
They all will come to call if you can fall on your face
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown!
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Be the poor silly ass
And you'll always travel first class
The Brothers Marx hit our screens
With their zany routines
Groucho, brash and absurd
Harpo never uttered a word
Chico's quaint piano style
Had his audience in the aisle
They could have played French comedy, très, très élégant
Or scenes in English drawing rooms with riches to flaunt
But they knew they'd get far more laughs with Margaret Dumont
Be a
Chico!
Harpo!
Groucho!
- Wait a minute. This can't be my room.
- Yes, sir.
Suite number 58, sir.
Fifty-eight? That's an awful big number for a birdcage this size.
Wouldn't it be simpler if you just put the stateroom in the trunk?
Sing ho!
For the open highway
Sing ho!
For the open road
- Hello, boss. What are you doing here?
- Hello.
This makes it a perfect voyage.
- I'm sorry. I thought this was my trunk.
- It is your trunk.
I don't remember packing you boys.
Don't wake him up. He's got insomnia.
He's sleeping it off.
That's as grisly a looking object as I've ever seen.
Get him up out of there.
- Yes?
- We've come to make up your room.
Come in, girls. Leave all hope behind.
Work fast because you gotta get out in 10 minutes.
Tomasso. Wake up.
They're going to fix the bed.
I'd like two pillows on that bed there.
There's a slight misunderstanding here.
I said the girls had to work fast, not your friend.
He's still asleep.
You know, he does better asleep than I do awake.
Yeah, he always sleeps that way.
- Now he's half-asleep.
- Yes, he's half-asleep in a half Nelson.
- All right, come on.
- Yes?
I'm the engineer.
I'm here to turn off the heat.
You can start right in on him.
Did you want a manicure?
No. Come on in.
I hadn't planned on a manicure, but on a journey like this... you ought to have every convenience you can get.
Did you want your nails long or short?
You better make them short.
It's getting kind of crowded in here.
I'm the engineer's assistant.
I had a premonition you were going to show up.
The engineer's over there in the corner.
You can chop your way right through.
Is it my imagination, or is it getting crowded in here?
I got plenty of room.
- Yes?
- Is my Aunt Minnie in here?
You can come in and prowl around if you want to.
If she isn't in here, you can probably find somebody just as good.
- Could I use your phone?
- Use the phone?
- I'll lay you even money you can't get in.
- How do you do?
This boat will be in New York before you get to that phone.
I came to mop up.
Just the woman I'm looking for.
Come right ahead.
You have to start on the ceiling.
It's the only place that's not occupied.
- You can clean my shoes if you want to.
- Operator.
Tell Aunt Minnie to send up a bigger room, will you?
- Steward.
- Come right ahead.
- The food!
- We've been waiting all afternoon for you.
I want my Aunt Minnie!
From this moment on
You and I, babe
We'll be riding high, babe
Every care is gone
From this moment on
Kiss Me Kate with Cole Porter's lilting music... choreographed by Hermes Pan... and performed by Ann Miller and company.
That's Bob Fosse dancing with Carol Haney.
I wonder what ever happened to him.
I love the looks of you
The lure of you
I'd love to make a tour of you
The arms, the eyes the mouth of you
The east, west, north and the south of you
I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love, at least, a small percent of me, do
For I love all of you
Cyd Charisse, lovely Cyd Charisse.
How she dances.
This is from Silk Stockings.
I get too hungry for dinner at 8.;00
I like the theater but never come late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp
Beautiful Lena Horne sings a great
Rodgers and Hart standard... from the film Words and Music.
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Don't dish the dirt
With the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp
I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
I'm broke, that's oke
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
Jerome Kern wrote some of the loveliest melodies I've ever heard.
And none lovelier than this one, sung by Kathryn Grayson... and danced by
Marge and Gower Champion.
Something here inside
Cannot be denied
They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
I could hardly wait to keep our date
This lovely Easter morning
Someone once asked Jerome Kern... where in American music he would place Irving Berlin.
Mr. Kern replied,
"Irving Berlin is American music."
For
In your Easter bonnet with all the frills upon it
You'll be the grandest fella in the Easter parade
I'll be all in clover and when they look us over
We'll be the proudest couple in the Easter parade
On the avenue
Fifth A venue
The photographers will snap us
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure
Oh, I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet
And of the guy I'm taking to the Easter parade
On the avenue
Fifth A venue
The photographers will snap us
And you'll find that you're in the rotogravure
I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet
And of the girl I'm taking to the Easter parade
Anything that happens in life can happen on the screen
Fantasies appear
Colorful and queer
Watch me
You'll see just what I mean
First
Take the red from the scene
After that
Please remove all the green
Then the yellow and blue, make them disappear, too
What's left?
Black and white
But that's quite all right
It's entertainment
You came
I was alone
Here's Bing Crosby... starting us off in some numbers filmed in glorious black and white.
The siren he's singing to is Fifi D'Orsay.
The film is Going Hollywood.
Born to be kissed
I can't resist
You are temptation and I am yours
Here is my heart
Take it and say we'll never part
I'm just a slave
Only a slave to you
Temptation
Dear, when you smiled at me
I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Judy Garland told me that this is the song she sang... for her audition at MGM.
By the way, she got the job.
Zing! Went the strings of my heart!
I still recall the thrill
I guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
I knew I loved you heaps and you were mine for keeps
Zing! Went the strings of my heart!
The wonderful Ethel Waters in Cabin in the Sky.
And that's Rochester on guitar.
Here I go again
I'm hearing trumpets blow again
All aglow again
Taking a chance on love
Here I slide again
About to take that ride again
Starry-eyed again
Taking a chance on love
I thought the cards were a frame-up
And I never would try
But now I'm taking the game up
And the ace of hearts is high
Things are mending now
I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have our happy ending now
Taking a chance on love
Got to swing that jinx away
Swing a hi-de-hey
Hi-de-hey-de
Rap, tap on wood
Eleanor Powell in Born to Dance.
And she sure was.
Three cheers for the red, white, and blue
Three cheers for the red, white, and blue
The Army and Navy forever
Three cheers for the red, white, and blue
Men, the ship we were waiting for is anchored in the river... but it's in the hands of the police.
Our plan's been discovered, and if we're ever to have our freedom... we've got to fight for it tonight.
Who's with me?
Not me.
All right, if I have to, I'll go alone.
- Wait, Charles. I'll go with you.
- One man at last.
And me, too.
Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald were the king and queen of operetta... and New Moon was one of their most popular.
Now we're 10! That makes an army.
Come on!
Give me some men
Who are stout-hearted men
Who will fight for the right they adore
Start me with ten
Who are stout-hearted men
And I'll soon give you ten thousand more
I'm going.
Shoulder to shoulder
And bolder and bolder
They grow as they go to the fore
Then there's nothing in the world
Can halt or mar a plan
When stout-hearted men
Can stick together man to man
Charles, you can't fight the whole French fleet.
It's fight or perish for every man on this island.
- Charles.
- Goodbye, Marianne.
Forgive me for any grief
I've ever caused you.
Charles.
You'll come back, Charles.
You must come back to me.
This eager heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
Near or far, where ever you are
I'm coming back to you
Love will guide me
In the light that follows night
I'll see you smiling through
Your love
Will be beside me
The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while you're waiting there
This heart of mine is singing
I will come back
- To you
- To me
Oh, what a tune
One of my favorite comedians... also happens to be one of my favorite human beings... that lovable lunatic, Jimmy Durante.
It's got the whole world spooning
I'm walking down the street
I'm walking down the street
Tell me, Mr. James, now just what did you accomplish?
That note was given to me by Bing Crosby... and was he glad to get rid of it.
I got rhythm, I got music
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies
Now, Busby Berkeley's dude-ranch finale from Girl Crazy... with Judy, Mickey, and Tommy Dorsey.
Old Man Trouble,
I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door
I got starlight
I got sweet dreams
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Take a pie in the face
And you'll wow the whole human race
In the beginning, there was slapstick comedy.
And Laurel and Hardy.
So you can't sleep?
Abbott and Costello being
Abbott and Costello.
I'm going to put this in your ears... and then when I go to sleep, you won't hear the record.
When I go to sleep, you take the arm off...
- and the record will stop, and I'll sleep.
- All right.
- Yes.
- Now how's that?
Everything all right?
How's that? All right?
Is that all right?
I said, is that all right?
- Is that all right, the stuff in your ears?
- Yes. Can't hear. Swell.
And when you go to sleep, I'll turn it off.
- Take it off. These are good.
- Go ahead and get your sleep.
I know I'll get some sleep.
- I'm gonna get some sleep.
- What?
I says, I'm gonna get some sleep.
- That's what I'm here for.
- Then why do you keep saying...
- I can't hear you, please.
- Then keep them in your ears...
- you don't have to listen to nothing.
- What?
Look. Now listen.
Don't get excited, please. Will you?
With these in my ears, I can't hear.
Here. Try it yourself now. See that?
Now can you hear anything?
- What?
- Can you hear me?
You can't hear anything, can you?
How can I hear if you're gonna put these in my ears like that?
After all, I can't hear if you got them in my ears.
He's got them again.
In this 1929 film... among a group of songwriters, we find...
Well, he'll introduce himself.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce myself.
My name is Jack Benny, and I was asked... to be master of ceremonies for this occasion.
I'd like to identify these boys for you... so in case you find them prowling around your home some night... you'll know how to address them.
Mr. Nacio Herb Brown, the composer at the piano... and Mr. Arthur Freed, the lyricist... who also writes the words.
These two boys wrote...
Doll Dance, Broadway Melody...
You Were Meant For Me, the Pagan Love Song... and The Wedding of the Painted Doll.
It's a holiday
Today's the wedding of the painted doll
It's a jolly day
The news is spreading all around the hall
Red Riding Hood and Buster Brown
The Jumping Jack jumped into town
From far and near, they're coming here
Church bells ringing
Bringing all the little dollies
From the follies
With their painted cheeks
Little mama doll has fussed around for weeks and weeks
Shoo the blues, no time to lose
Bikes and shoes will spread the news
That it's a holiday
Today's the wedding of the little painted doll
I've come to the conclusion that it's a very simple matter to write a popular song.
Let's see how song writer Sammy Cahn feels about that.
Writing a song can be agony or ecstasy.
It can take half an hour or half a year.
But when anyone writes a song in a movie... there never seems to be any problem.
Inspiration turns on faster than a light bulb.
For instance... look how hard
Ann Sothern and Robert Young... have to struggle to write a song... which was written by
George and Ira Gershwin.
And lovely.
Hey, "Oh, sweet and lovely."
Oh, sweet and lovely, can it be true?
You are the one
Baby, be mine
Baby, be mine
Oh, sweet and lovely,
Baby, be mine
Baby, be good
Lady, be good
That's it, "Lady, be good."
Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Yeah!
Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
How's that?
I am so awfully misunderstood
So, lady, be good to me
...this feeling.
Lew Ayres, prodded by Al Shean... sets his love for Jeanette MacDonald to music.
You got something that hurts you, that's important, that means something.
Well, write it out. Put it in notes.
Orchestrate it.
Make the violins tell it, and the brasses.
You never lost Mary Hale.
You lost yourself.
You were like a bird that wouldn't fly, a fish that wouldn't swim... a musician that wouldn't write.
Speaking a woman's name night after night before you go to sleep... that's for nobodies, for weaklings.
But you, you got to sing out on them so she'll hear it... and no matter where she is, she'll hear her name in your music... and then she'll come back to you.
Although your tears may fall
Jimmy.
We won't be far apart
Summer journeys to Niagara
And to other places
Aggravate all our cares
We'll save our fares
I've a cozy little flat in what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town
We'll have Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
Now Mickey Rooney and Tom Drake show us... how Rodgers and Hart did it.
It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow to and fro
Fred Astaire and Red Skelton as Kalmar and Ruby.
I wouldn't write that song with you if you begged me.
Begged you? I didn't even ask you.
I guess you just can't help it, Harry.
I feel sorry for you.
Feel sorry for me?
You must think I'm just some...
I can tell you what I think of you in three little words.
You're a dope!
Three little words, "You're a dope."
You are a dope
In the film The Great Waltz...
Fernand Gravet as Johann Strauss... composedTales from the Vienna Woods... just by riding through the woods with Miliza Korjus.
Come on, my Rosie
Come on, my Rosie
That's entertainment
Good morning
Good morning
It's great to stay up late
Good morning
Good morning to you
When the band began to play
This is one of those terrific
Singin' in the Rain numbers... with Gene, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor having a ball.
So, good morning
Good morning
Sunbeams will soon smile through
Good morning
Good morning to you and you and you and you
Good morning
Good morning
We've gabbed the whole night through
Good morning
Good morning to you
Nothing could be grander
Than to be in Louisiana
In the morning
In the morning
It's great to stay up late
Good morning
Good morning to you
Might be just as iffy
If we was in Mississippi
When we left the movie show the future wasn't bright
But came the dawn the show goes on and I don't want to say good night
- So say good morning
- Good morning
Rainbows are shining through
Good morning
Good morning
Bonjour
Buenos Dias
Buongiorno
Guten Morgen
Good morning to you
Fred, Nanette Fabray, and Jack Buchanan... as a very young trio in this Schwartz and
Dietz number from Band Wagon.
Mrs. Wipple Poofer loves to talk to Mrs. Hildendorfer
Of the fatal natal day she had her silly Willy
Mrs. Hudson-Cooper loves to talk to Mrs. Golden-Wasser
Of her major operation when she had her twins
But when Mother comes along
She silences the others
She accomplished something that is very rare in mothers
MGM has got a Leo
But Mama has got a trio
She is proud but says three is a crowd
Oh, we do everything alike
We look alike
We dress alike, we walk alike
We talk alike, and what is more
We hate each other very much
We hate our folks
We're sick of jokes on what an art it is to tell us apart
We eat the same kind of vittles
We drink the same kind of bottles
We sit in the same kind of highchair highchair, highchair
I wish I had a gun
A real gun
It would be fun to shoot the other two
And be only one
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Fred, you remember those wonderful parties with Judy... where she'd get up and sing this song?
She first sang it to Margaret O'Brien in Meet Me in St. Louis.
Next year all our troubles will be miles away
Once again, as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who were dear to us
Will be near to us once more
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little
Christmas now
Stepping out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
It's for sure, not for maybe
That I'm all dressed up tonight
Here you are again, Fred, in Easter Parade.
Can't be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knocking wood
There'll be smooth sailing
'Cause I'm trimming my sails
With a bright shine on my shoes
And on my nails
Stepping out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will the day be
The big day may be tonight
What a fabulous bit of trick photography.
Please, Kelly. I don't tell your secrets.
Ten cents a dance
That's what they pay me
Gosh, how they weigh me down
Doris Day, belting out another great Rodgers and Hart tune... from Love Me or Leave Me.
Ten cents a dance
Dandies and rough guys
Tough guys who tear my gown
7.;00 to midnight
I hear drums
Loudly the saxophone blows
Trumpets are tearing my eardrums
Customers crush my toes
Sometimes I think
I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance
All that you need is a ticket
Come on, big boy
Ten cents a dance
- I got
- Rhythm
- I got
- Music
- I got
- My gal
Who could ask for anything more?
I've always said,
"Just put Gene with a bunch of kids...
"and you're bound to come up with a winner. " Watch.
- I got
- My gal
Who could ask for anything more?
Old man Trouble,
I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door
- Vous comprenez ca?
- Non!
- I got
- Rhythm
- I got
- Music
- I got
- My gal
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?
Charlot!
Charlie Chaplin!
Aeroplane!
Who could ask for anything more?
More!
C'est tout!
Au revoir!
You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly you're sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy
Then snap!
Those eyes, those sighs
They're part of the tender trap
After having sung with the Harry James and Tommy Dorsey orchestras...
Frank Sinatra made his solo debut... at the Paramount Theater in New York in December 1942.
They had to call out the police to control the crowds.
Especially his most avid fans, the bobbysoxers.
When he walked out on the stage... it was not merely the birth of a star... but the creation of a legend.
I'll walk alone
They'll ask me why
And I'll tell them I'd rather
There are dreams I must gather
I'll walk alone
It was inevitable that the Sinatra hysteria would lead him to Hollywood... and equally inevitable... that producer Arthur Freed would choose him... to sing Kern and Hammerstein's classic. ;
OI' Man River.
OI'man river
That ol'man river
He must know somethin'
But he don't say nothin'
He just keeps rollin'
He keeps on rollin'along
He don't plant taters
And he don't plant cotton
And them what plants 'em
Is soon forgotten
But ol'man river
Just keeps rollin'along
I fall in love too easily
There's something about a Sinatra ballad that makes it automatically unforgettable.
Here is young Blue Eyes singing one of my favorites from Anchors Aweigh.
I fall in love too terribly hard
For love to ever last
My heart should be well-schooled
'Cause I've been fooled in the past
And still I fall in love too easily
I fall in love too fast
I believe
Frank sings to
Jimmy Durante and Billy Roy in. ;
It Happened in Brooklyn.
If you'll wish for the dream
By the wishing well
Don't tell the wish or you'll break the spell
It may sound naive
But that's what I believe
I don't care
High Society.
And it can't get much higher... than Frank serenading the future princess of Monaco.
'Cause you're sensational
Making love is quite an art
What you require is the proper squire to fire your heart
And if you'll say that one fine day
You'll let me come to call
We'll have a ball
'Cause you're sensational
Sensational
That's all
She argued
Fought like a wildcat
She threatened
Practically drew a gun on the boy
She said
"You can't send me home
- "Not like this"
- What happened?
She finally got her kiss
It seems only yesterday that I did this number with Frank.
That's when he taught me how to dance.
What a time we had tonight
What a dish, what a dream, what a dame
And she lives alone
I gets weary
And so sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin'
But I'm feared of dyin'
And ol'man river
He just keeps rollin'
Along
Movie buffs and the rest
Have a line or scene they like best
The courtroom where a lawyer pleads for his client's life
A sleuth that's hot but cannot spot the gun or the knife
But you'll knock 'em flat with
"That's no lady, that was my wife"
They all last, unsurpassed
Here's the cast
Please let me stay.
But I want to be alone.
I just want to be alone.
We want to be alone.
But we want to be left alone.
Do you want to be alone, comrade?
No.
I don't know how you'll look tomorrow... but right now, you're the most beautiful dame in the world.
- You want to work with me?
- Yes, Mr. Gallagher.
Shake.
- Yes, sir.
- Now beat it.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Mr. Chips.
Annual income £20.
Annual expenditure £19.
Result? Happiness.
Annual income £20.
Annual expenditure £21.
Result? Misery.
That advice is so far worth taking...
I have never taken it myself... and I am the miserable creature you behold.
Grand Hotel. Always the same.
People come, people go.
Nothing ever happens.
I was reading a book the other day.
Reading a book?
Yes, it's all about civilization or something.
A nutty kind of a book.
Do you know the guy says... that machinery is going to take the place of every profession?
Oh, my dear.
That's something you need never worry about.
I'd like to run barefoot through your hair.
The picturesque impressions indelibly fixed in our memory.
It is time to conclude our visit... and reluctantly say farewell to Hong Kong... the hub of the Orient.
And as the midnight sun lingers on the skyline of the city... we most reluctantly say farewell to Stockholm...
Venice of the north.
And it is in this paradise of the Canadian Rockies... that we reluctantly say farewell to beautiful Banff.
With this thought, we most reluctantly say... farewell to the Taj Mahal.
We reluctantly say, farewell, colorful Guatemala.
We reluctantly conclude our visit to Japan.
Farewell to Ireland, the Emerald Isle.
Farewell to Switzerland.
Farewell Udaipur.
Farewell to all...
Farewell...
I am Tandaleo.
Jane. Tarzan.
Please stop.
Just walk natural, as if you were out for a stroll.
Not a word.
Hold it right there!
Where are you going with that elephant?
What elephant?
As soon as I saw you, I said to myself:
"There's a hot-looking little number."
Don't let it throw you, champ.
I'm 20 degrees cooler than you think.
Dames are just like traffic.
Sometimes you got to stop.
Sometimes you got to go.
Certain women should be struck regularly, like gongs.
You see that chess game over there?
When I was 4 years old,
I played 10 people all at once... blindfolded.
I lost every game.
Lie down.
Stand up.
Grandpa, I love you.
Rosetta, I love you.
Tippy, I love you.
Honey, I love you.
Honey, I love you.
Kippy, I love you.
I love you, Duke.
What're you trying to do?
Steal my gag line?
To begin with, I took four years at Vassar.
Vassar? But that's a girls' college.
I found that out the third year.
I'd have been there yet, but I went out for the swimming team.
It's all right. That's in every contract.
That's what they call a sanity clause.
You can't fool me.
There ain't no Sanity Claus.
Hold me closer.
Closer.
I hold you any closer, I'd be in back of you.
It's a far, far better thing I do, than I have ever done.
It's a far, far better rest I go to... than I have ever known.
You're my Lassie come home.
But, Rhett, if you go... where shall I go? What shall I do?
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
What can I say about Paris that wouldn't be redundant?
Even people who have never been there know of its glories... from songs, books, movies, paintings... even cookbooks.
And thanks to the invention of film and records... there is one national treasure... who will live as long as all the others.
That's Paris.
City of girls and lights!
Maurice Chevalier.
Here he is, singing about his Paris, in one of his early films.
I'm going to Maxim 's
Where all the girls are dreams
Each kiss goes on the wine list
And mine is quite a fine list
Lolo, Dodo, Juju
Cloclo, Margot, Frufru
We promise to be faithful
Until the night is through
Let us gaze in the wine while it's wet
Let's do things that we'll live to regret
Let me dance till the restaurant whirls
With the girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
Where there's wine and there's women and song
It is wrong not to do something wrong
When you do something wrong
You must do something right
And I'm doing all right tonight
You know...
I guess more songs have been written about Paris than any other city.
One of the loveliest and most poignant... was by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein.
Dinah Shore sings it in
Till the Clouds Roll by.
The last time I saw Paris her trees were dressed for spring
And lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing
I dodged the same old taxicabs that I had dodged for years
The chorus of their squeaky horns was music to my ears
The last time I saw Paris her heart was warm and gay
No matter how they change her
I'll remember her that way
Paris is called the City of Lights.
When these lights are turned on, it becomes the diamond of the world.
Lovers, of course... prefer the romantic shadows along the banks of the Seine.
Another famous Parisian landmark... but of a different kind.
We see Georges Guetary performing... in true Folies-Bergère style.
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
I'm going to get there at any price
Stand aside, I'm on my way
I've got the blues
And up above, it's so fair
Shoes, go on and carry me there
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
I'm going to get there at any price
Stand aside, I'm on my way
I've got the blues
And up above, it's so fair
Shoes, go on and carry me there
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day
With a new step every day
The place du Trocadéro is one of my favorite places in Paris.
It's a great hangout for children who skate.
So I always bring my kids here to join me.
You know... a number on roller skates, that might not be a bad idea.
This is Montmartre... a very different section of the city.
As you see, the sidewalks are jammed with young artists plying their trade.
Montmartre is also world-renowned for its colorful cabarets.
The cancan, danced by Gwen Verdon and company.
Not far from Paris is Versailles.
One of the most beautiful palaces ever built.
A museum now, it's still used for special state dinners... and charity balls.
Some suggestion of a...
Bal de Versaille... was captured by Ernst Lubitsch in the picture The Merry Widow... filmed in 1934.
Gene dances in the cartoon
Then there's Bing,
He and Louis will croon
Bobby Van could jump over the moon
That's entertainment
You'll see Fred and Judy as tramps
Cyd plays one of those glamorous vamps
Howard Keel,
He'll sum up the whole deal
The world's a cartoon
A great big balloon of entertainment
Hey, Gene, you've had some very unusual dancing partners.
But these, from Invitation to the Dance, beat everything.
Well, you take some skins
Jazz begins
And you take a bass
Man, now we're gettin' someplace
Take a box
One that rocks
Take a blue horn, New Orleans-born
High Society brings Bing and Satchmo together to explain jazz.
Take a bone
Hold the phone
Take a spot
Cool and hot
Now you has jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz, jazz
Pops, you want to grab a little of what's left here?
- Yeah, daddy, yeah
- Here we go
- If you sail
- A-sailin', sailin'
- Over the sea
- Will you wait for me?
Take my tip, they're all molto hip in Italy
Well, arrivederci
As for France?
- I know you're very big there
- Yes, believe it or not
I do believe
I do indeed
The Frenchmen all prefer what they call
- "Le jazz hot"
- Formidable
Take a plane
Go to Siam
In Bangkok today, round the clock, they all like the jazz
Indians on the Amazon
Beat one bar, and all of them are
Oh, well, gone, man, gone!
From the Equator
Up to the Pole
Everybody wingin', everybody singin'
That rock, rock, rock, rock 'n'roll
And from the east to the west
From the coast to the coast
Jazz is king 'cause jazz is the thing the folks dig most
Now that's jazz
We're a couple of swells
We stop at the best hotels
But we prefer the country far away from the city smells
Fred, here you are with Judy.
Even when you play a tramp, you're in top hat and tails.
The pride of the tennis courts
In June, July, and August we look cute when we're dressed in shorts
The Vanderbilts are waiting at the club
But how are we to get there, that's the rub
That's the rub
We would sail up the avenue but we haven't got a yacht
We would drive up the avenue but the horse we had was shot
We would ride on a trolley car but we haven't got the fare
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes, we'll walk up the avenue
Yes, we'll walk up the avenue till we're there
We would swim up the avenue but we haven't any lake
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes, we'll walk up the avenue
Yes, a walk up the avenue's what we'll take
"V" stands for vim, vigor, vitality, and Bobby Van... in this number from Small Town Girl.
How.
Take me to Broadway, and let me take it from there
Take me to Broadway, and let me take it from there
- Gotta dance!
- Gotta dance!
- Gotta dance!
- Gotta dance!
Cyd Charisse... lovely Cyd Charisse, how she dances.
This from Singin' in the Rain.
There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
In Annie Get Your Gun...
Betty Hutton, Howard Keel, Keenan Wynn,
Louis Calhern, and company... tear the screen apart... with Irving Berlin's fabulous anthem to entertainment.
There's no people like show people
They smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold
You may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold
Let's go on with the show
Let's go on with the show!
There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
Everything the traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feelin'
When you are stealin' that extra bow
There's no people like show people
They smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold
You may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold
Let's go on with the show
Let's go on with the
Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.
They starred in nine films together... and were, undoubtedly, the most successful dramatic team... in screen history.
Let's look at some of their work, together, and apart.
There, that's better. I'm Father Flanagan.
I saw your brother Joe just a little while ago.
We had a long talk about you, Whitey.
Joe wants you to come with me to Boys Town.
You've got a swell chance taking me to that joint.
Look, in a pinch,
I can be tougher than you are... and I guess, maybe, this is the pinch.
You're coming with me to Boys Town because that's what your brother wants.
And that's the way I want it.
Shorty, you mind backing up and letting me by?
Yeah, I do mind. Suppose you back up, and don't call me Shorty.
Shorty or sonny, what difference does it make?
Move over, bud.
I'm wearing Justin boots with 4-inch heels.
They'll sure make big dents in that little frame of yours.
Lady athlete, properly handled, always a market.
Always.
I don't think you've ever been properly handled.
That's right, not even by myself.
Very few brains.
- There's one thing I got to say, though.
- What?
Nicely packed, that kit.
Is, at that.
Not much meat on her, but what's there is cherce.
- Let's get out.
- Okay.
I told you already.
I ain't going to make no deals with you.
- Two against one.
- That's right, two against one... and that's how it is in this business, too, wise guy.
Two against one.
You want your usual percent?
My glasses.
That's no fair.
What's the big idea?
Where are my glasses?
- What is this?
- It's no fair.
Did you ever see a thing like this before?
We're so different, we could help each other, couldn't we?
- I mean, really help. That is, if we...
- What?
Don't rush me. Give me time.
- One, two, three...
- I've been thinking... all sorts of things in all ways.
Backwards, forwards, every which way, but chiefly forwards.
I hope that means that you've decided to stop living in the past.
Yes, and I've got to thinking maybe you're right.
It is stupid of me, it is selfish... but it is a terrible world to live in alone with just memories.
You've got qualities to face it and do something about it with.
Your eye is so clear. You see straight.
You're so honest, quick, aware, fearless, forthright, and...
- Wait a minute.
- Don't stop me.
I'm none of those, except maybe honest.
I've got qualities for it, too.
I'm strong and have lots of energy.
I'm brave, too. Things don't get me down, and I can take punishment.
It isn't just this house I can offer you or myself as an assistant.
After all we said to each other that night... the way we understand each other about love... you know I never could... and I know you never could or would want to... and then there's all that powerful commodity to be put to use.
- So I thought...
- You thought?
I wondered if you'd like to marry me.
What were you doing down in my bailiwick today?
- Just a little ambulance chasing.
- Successful?
- I got the case.
- What case?
A girl named Doris Attinger shot her husband. I'm going to defend her.
Now, when did you begin to suspect... that you were losing your husband's affection?
When he started batting me around.
Farewell, Amanda
What's the matter?
Don't you want your rub now? What...
What are you, sore about a little slap?
No.
- What then?
- You meant that, didn't you?
- You really meant that.
- No.
I can tell, I know your touch.
- I know a slap from a slug.
- Okay.
I'm not so sure it is.
I'm not so sure I care to expose myself... to typical, instinctive masculine brutality.
Come, now.
It felt not only like you meant it, but like you felt you had a right to.
I can tell.
What have you got back there, radar equipment?
All right.
Break it up.
Adam. Listen to me.
Don't you handle me, lady. I'm not nutty.
Adam, you're sick. Please.
- What do you think you're doing?
- Teaching a lesson.
Him first, then comes yours.
- Now get away, Amanda.
- Don't you do it.
Stop it, Adam. Stop it!
- You've no right.
- That's all I wanted to hear.
Licorice.
If there's anything I'm a sucker for, it's licorice.
- I figure you can take care of yourself.
- No, I can't.
- I bet you could even lick me.
- No, I couldn't.
- Sure. I think so.
- No, I couldn't.
- I need someone to look after me.
- What about me?
Why not?
I don't know if I can lick you or you can lick me...
- but I'll tell you one thing I do know.
- What?
- Together, we can lick them all.
- You bet.
And together they did... because everything about Tracy and Hepburn... was cherce.
Can it be
I like myself
She likes me
So, I like myself
If someone wonderful as she is can think I'm wonderful
I must be quite a guy
Gene, you finally did work out that number on skates, didn't you?
Yes, I guess I did... in a film dreamed up by Comden and Green... called It's Always Fair Weather.
Dislike myself
But now my love has got me ridin'high
She likes me, so, so do I
I can remember everything as if it were yesterday.
- We met at 9.;00
- We met at 8.;00
- I was on time
- No, you were late
Ah yes, I remember it well
Here's my favorite boulevardier with Hermione Gingold... and a lovely Lerner and Loewe song from Gigi.
I remember it well
That dazzling April moon!
There was none that night
And the month was June
That's right, that's right
It warms my heart
To know that you
Remember still
The way you do
Ah yes
I remember it well
- That carriage ride
- You walked me home
- You lost a glove
- I lost a comb
Ah yes, I remember it well
- That brilliant sky!
- We had some rain
- Those Russian songs
- From sunny Spain
Ah yes, I remember it well
You wore a gown of gold
I was all in blue
Am I getting old?
Oh, no not you!
How strong you were
How young and gay
A prince of love in every way
Ah yes
I remember it well
The last time
Ginger and I worked together... was in The Barkley's of Broadway.
I think this is one of the best routines you ever did.
Yes!
No picture about entertainment would be complete... without a number from wet and wonderful Esther Williams.
And she does it without trick photography.
A show that is really a show
Sends you out with a kind of a glow
And you say as you go on your way
That's entertainment
The art that appeals to the heart
Is a song that just has to belong
Or a dance that is sure to entrance
That's entertainment
And now may we pause
For a moment or two?
Because there's a chore that we feel we should do
We'd like to name just a few of the stars
You have seen here
Performing a song or scene here
There were
Judy Garland, Leslie Caron,
Greta Garbo, Doris Day
Bob Taylor, Jack Buchanan,
Tony Martin, Maurice Chevalier
Bing Crosby, Mickey Rooney,
Eleanor Powell, Nanette Fabray
That's entertainment
Clark Gable, Melvyn Douglas,
Bob Montgomery, John Barrymore
Hermione Gingold, Esther Williams,
Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore
- Franchot Tone, Greer Garson
- Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy
Roddy McDowall, Myrna Loy, and William Powell
Jeanette MacDonald, Debbie Reynolds,
Marge and Gower Champion
Ann Miller, Cary Grant, Ann Sothern,
Louis Armstrong, Bobby Van
Jean Harlow, Cyd Charisse,
Joan Crawford, Vivien Leigh, Tarzan
That makes forty-two
We've missed many who have entertained you
And if it's a hit, then they'll go on from there
They played a charade that was lighter than air
A good old-fashioned affair
As we sing this finale
We hope it was up your alley
No death like you get in Macbeth
No ordeal like the end of Camille
This goodbye brings a tear to the eye
The world is a stage
The stage is the world of entertainment
English
One day, when I was 6 years old,
I saw a magnificent picture in a nature book about the primeval forest.
It was a picture of a boa constrictor swallowing an animal.
I'm trying to make a sketch of it to show you.
Under this splendid picture, it said;
"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it."
There.
"And then remain stationary for six months digesting it."
I pondered that deeply.
And after some work, I succeeded in making my first drawing.
I called it Drawing Number One.
I showed my masterpiece to the grownups.
I asked them if it frightened them.
Frighten us?
Why should we be frightened of a hat?
A hat?
It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.
Obviously.
Since the grownups were not able to understand it, I made another, showing the elephant inside the boa constrictor, so they could see it clearly.
My Drawing Number Two.
This time, I was told to stop wasting my time drawing boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and attend to my studies, which I did.
And that is why, at the age of 6,
I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.
As I grew up, whenever I'd meet one who seemed to be at all clear-sighted, in order to find out if he was really a person of true understanding,
I would show him my first drawing.
But whoever it was would say;
It's a hat, it's a hat
It's a sort of a kind of hat
Painted poorly
But it surely is a hat
It's a hat, it's a hat
There's no doubt of it, it's a hat
Top of Papa
Is its proper habitat
My, oh, my, look at that
Why, this dummy has drawn a hat
It's a hat, it's a hat
If it's anything, it's a hat
Why, it's nothing but a common
Himalayan mountain hat
A hat that looks like down upon
Which someone must've sat
Not Picasso or Corot
But a very nice chapeau
Are you kidding?
It's a hat, you silly brat
Every grownup was the same
Uniformly, they'd exclaim
It's a hat, it's a hat, it's a hat
I could see it wasrt won'th
Spending time with them on earth
There were fewer in the sky
I decided I would fly
- It's a hat
- It's a hat
- It's a hat
- It's a hat
It's a hat, it's a hat, it's a hat
I need air
Where only stars get in my hair
And only eagles stop and stare
I need air
All the world is mad
And I have had my share
I need air
I need air
I need air
One hour of mortal wear and tear
Gives my morale moral-de-mer
Any corner lot
That heavers got to spare
I need air
I need air
There's not a sign of life down there
Just hats and grownups everywhere
I need air
Lots of cozy sky
That God and I can share
I need air
I need air
Over the years,
I came to know many grownups, and my opinion of them never improved.
In time, I stopped showing my drawing and never again mentioned boa constrictors, elephants or stars.
Instead, I would talk about golf, money, politics and neckties.
And everyone was pleased to have met such a sensible man.
So I lived my life alone, without anyone I could really talk to, until a short time ago.
I was testing a new plane, racing it against the clock from Paris to India.
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Come in, please, over.
F-BDXY to Paris.
Ground speed: 1 -9-0.
Running ten minutes behind schedule.
Strong headwinds.
Trouble!
- Losing altitude!
- Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Detail location.
Repeat, detail location.
Detail location.
Repeat, detail location.
Paris calling flight F-BDXY.
Are you there, F-BDXY?
Where are you?
If you please, draw me a sheep.
Will you?
- Will I what?
- Will you draw me a sheep?
Who are...?
Where did you...?
How did you...?
How did you get here?
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you to draw me a sheep.
No, no. Listen to me.
- Where did you come from?
- Will you draw me a sheep?
Don't you know any other words?
Is that all you can say?
No.
Will you draw me a sheep?
When a mystery is too overpowering, one doesn't dare disobey.
A thousand miles from civilization and death at my heels,
I picked up a pad and pencil and began to draw.
Look, I...
I don't know how to draw.
- That doesn't matter.
- And I certainly can't draw a sheep.
I've only drawn one thing in my whole life.
Here.
Oh, no. I don't want an elephant inside a boa constrictor.
A boa constrictor is very dangerous, and an elephant is very cumbersome.
Where I live, everything is very small.
What I need is a sheep.
Do you live in a small town?
On a small island?
Where is it very small?
What sort of object is that?
- What?
- That.
It's called an aeroplane.
It flies.
I was flying in it, but it broke down.
Then you must have dropped from the sky.
That's right.
You too. How funny.
If you don't mind, I prefer having my misfortunes taken seriously.
- What do you mean, "you too"?
- That's a very sick-Iooking sheep.
Is that how you got here?
In a plane that crashed?
Could you make another?
- Why?
- Because that one doesn't look well.
This is not the way two strangers get to know each other on the average desert.
This is the way.
Ask me a question.
- Where do you come from?
- Good.
To which I reply,
"I come from Paris."
Now I'll ask you a question.
- Where do you come from?
- Is Paris on this planet?
Of course it's on this planet.
I'm sorry, it won't do.
- Why not?
- See for yourself.
That's not a sheep.
It's a ram. It has horns.
Do you think this is all I have to do?
I have this engine to take apart and fix before my water runs out.
I have no time to draw for a little boy dressed in a coat, carrying a sword, who appears from nowhere in the middle of the Sahara.
There, and that's the last.
There's no horns.
No.
It's not sick.
No.
- Well, then?
- It's old.
I'm sorry.
It's only his box.
The sheep you asked for is inside.
That's perfect, exactly the way I wanted it.
It is?
Good.
Do you think this sheep will need a lot of grass?
- Why?
- I told you.
Where I come from, everything is very small.
Don't worry.
It's a very small sheep.
This sheep isn't so small.
Alas, I couldn't argue with him.
I'd grown too old to see sheep through the walls of boxes.
Is Paris on this planet?
Of course it is.
Did you forget?
No, I didn't forget.
But why did you ask?
- Arert you from this planet?
- The thing that's so good about this box is, at night, he can use it as his house.
- He's just going to sleep.
- Oh, sorry.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Where in God's name could you have come from?
- Do you know what asteroids are?
- What whats are?
- Asteroids.
- No.
They're very, very small planets.
The smallest, Asteroid B-61 2, was discovered by a Turkish astronomer in 1 909.
I think you may live on Asteroid B-61 2.
What do you think?
I think you may live on Asteroid B-61 2.
What do you think?
What do you think?
Does that mean they also eat baobab bushes?
- Who?
- The sheep.
Do they also eat flowers?
- Do they?
- Just hold it a minute, will you?
- Do they also eat flowers?
- What?
Oh, yes, they do.
Except the flowers that have thorns, of course.
No, they even eat the flowers that have thorns.
But the thorns protect them, don't they?
Maybe from being picked, but not from being eaten.
Then what's the good of having them?
- Having what?
- Thorns.
I don't know. Spite, I suppose.
Flowers have thorns just for spite.
I don't believe you.
Flowers are weak and helpless, and they know it.
How could they face the world if they didn't believe they were protected?
- What I'm doing here is important.
- Important?
Flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years.
And for millions of years, sheep have been eating them just the same.
Eating them.
And you think that's not important?
- Of course it is.
- I know one flower that's unique in all the world.
It grows nowhere but on my planet.
But some morning, a sheep can come along and destroy it with one single bite.
And you think that's not important?
- I suppose so.
- What you don't understand is, that if someone loves one flower that grows on one star among all the millions and millions of stars in the sky, it's enough to make him happy to look at the stars.
He can say to himself,
"Somewhere my flower's up there."
But if a sheep eats the flower, in one moment, all the stars will go dark.
And you think that's not important?
It's not a matter of consequence to you, is it?
Wait!
Wait! Come back!
I most humbly apologize.
I was behaving like a grownup.
Your flower is very important.
I swear it.
Come back!
Please!
Please come back!
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Little man, don't you know
That I'm on your side?
Why did you go?
Why did you go?
Little man, let me show you
I'm on your side
This world
Is an ocean without any shore
When you're on your own
Dawn is the end of the rope
When you're all alone
I've been, I've seen
I've known it
Where can you be?
Where can you be?
Hurry back, and you'll see
That I'm on your side
Where did you run?
Why did you run
From the one, only one
Who is on your side?
Everybody needs a friend
Come make use of me
God gave people hands to lend
Mine are free
So why stay away?
Come what may
I'm on
Your side
I missed him.
I wished I'd discovered more about him.
But he'd gone and taken his mystery with him.
Unaccustomed as I am to drawing anything but boa constrictors and elephants,
I decided to make a portrait of him so that I wouldn't forget him.
After all, he was a friend.
And not everyone has a friend.
Least of all me.
I'm hungry.
I have your supper right here.
I waited as long as I could.
I'd advise saving some of that till tomorrow.
That is, of course, unless you're very hungry.
Is this all you have?
Well, at the moment, yes.
This will be quite enough, thank you.
Needless to say, that problem you outlined, concerning the flower you know.
The one on the star, and your sheep...
In fact, all flowers and all sheep, that's...
That's extremely important.
In fact, I can't think of anything that's more important.
Well, I've been giving it a great deal of thought, and I...
I think I've come up with a solution that will remove your flower from any possibility of danger.
Now, this is my plan.
But this is subject to your approval, of course.
One, to draw a muzzle for your sheep.
Two...
If you can describe your planet to me in sufficient detail for me to make a drawing of it,
I'll put up a big, strong fence all around your flower.
Would you really do that?
Smaller.
Smaller.
I have three volcanoes.
- How big are they?
- Very big.
- Compared to you?
- Knee-high.
I have to clean them out every day.
- All by yourself?
- There's no one else.
There are three baobab bushes.
You don't have to draw them.
They don't come up for a while.
- Where's your house?
- On the other side.
You don't have to draw that either.
And my flower lives on this side here.
When she first came through the ground,
I was afraid she was going to be a baobab, but then she blossomed.
One bright, yellow morning, she blossomed.
- Good morning.
- Stop.
What is it?
- Give me a moment to wake up.
- I'm sorry.
How beautiful you are.
Yes, I know.
I was born at the same moment as the sun.
- Did you know that?
- No.
- Did you know you were quite selfish?
- Selfish?
Instead of thinking of my needs, you're standing there doing what you want to do, which is stare at me.
- What is it you need?
- Water.
- Water?
- I realize this is a small,
- unequipped little planet.
- I'll get it for you right away.
I brought her some water.
I brought it every day.
I did everything I could for her.
It's cooler when the sun goes down.
Do you have a glass bowl to put over me?
That will only make you weaker.
The night air is good for you.
I'm cold!
I'm cold!
You promised me a glass bowl.
It's not cold.
- Do you love me?
- Yes, I love you very much.
You've made my planet beautiful.
I don't believe it.
If you loved me, you'd know how cold I am.
I promise you, the nights aren't long.
You'll soon get used to it.
- Do you love me?
- I'll get the bowl.
I couldn't understand it, and I couldn't understand her.
I loved her, but I was so unappy.
I began to realize
I didn't really understand anything.
So I decided to leave my planet and go out into the universe and try to learn something.
I was wrong to leave her.
But at the time,
I didn't even understand that.
I was too young.
One morning,
I cleaned out my volcanoes, took one last look for baobabs and put my planet in order.
Good morning.
- You're all dressed up.
- Yes.
- You look very handsome.
- Thank you.
- You're going away, aren't you?
- Yes.
- For a long time?
- Perhaps.
I see.
It's my fault you're going, isn't it?
I've been very foolish, haven't I?
I wonder who will call on me when you're not here.
There are those two caterpillars, of course.
I don't like them, but one has to put up with them if one wants to meet butterflies.
For anything else, I have my thorns.
Well...
...if you're going...
: : : go:
- Goodbye.
- Be happy, be happy, be happy
Forget that I have no one
And nowhere to go
Be happy, be happy, be happy
Don't think of me in winter
All covered with snow
Be happy, be happy
Forget that I'll be crying still
And never
Will be happy
Be happy
Without you
Stop!
- Where are your papers?
- What papers?
You can't cross the border without papers.
- What border?
- That border there.
- You need a visa. Do you have one?
- No.
Then you can't cross it.
Those are the rules. Stop!
You almost backed into another country.
What are you? A smuggler?
A refugee? An idealist?
- Speak up. What are you?
- I'm ignorant.
Well, you might outgrow it.
Now, look...
My country is too small for both of us, but I have a colonial possession
1 foot to your left.
If your papers are in order, you can settle down there.
Your Majesty, it's such a small planet.
Why do you need borders?
Why do we need borders?
Yes. Why do you need borders?
You told me to ask questions.
But any child understands why we need borders.
- I don't.
- Well, of course you don't understand.
You're a child.
How do you expect
You can understand
International things and stuff?
Scissoring the earth
Carving up the land
Is the business of kings and stuff
Continentally, you are mentally
A silly-billy boy of 2
How absurd, it's uneard-of
You can never think as grownups do
Why, you
Why, you
Oh, you're a child
You're a child
You're a twerp
And that's putting it mild
You're a speck
You're a fleck
And it's just too tough
Pounding grown-up stuff
In the bean of a green little child
- Try.
- What?
Explain it to me. I want to learn.
Well...
Why do borderlines exist?
Well, first and foremost on the list
If all the borders were destroyed
Tomorrow, I'd be unemployed
And what would statesmen do for fun
If all at once the world was one?
And one could wander
Where he pleases
Flashing smiles instead of visas
Why, it could
It might
It would
Oh, go away and grow
Come again when you're
Not a mini-brained punk like this
You are really too undeveloped
For philosophical junk like this
Too adult is it? Difficult is it?
To get your teeth into?
Too bewildering for the children
And that, of course, means you
Means you
Means you
You're a child
You're a child
And the kind that can
Drive grownups wild
You're a wee little pea
Any thought profound
That I might expound
Wort fit into a pineaded child
Is that clear?
Now, where are your papers?
- I don't have any.
- You can't stay without papers.
Then I'll leave.
Just as well. You're dangerous.
Where's your passport?
- I don't have a passport.
- Then you can't leave.
Come back here!
Get off this planet!
Come back here!
Get off this planet!
Four hundred million and 997,000...
...plus six, equals 400,997,006!
Good day, sir.
Good day.
Five hundred million and ten!
Five hundred million and ten.
Plus one.
Five hundred million and 32!
Five hundred million, 32 what?
Five hundred million and 32 plus three.
Those things.
Five hundred million and 35.
- Stars?
- That's it. Stars.
Five hundred...
...million, 44.
- Plus...
- Why are you counting the stars?
Five hundred million...
I own them, and I want to see how much I have.
But what good does it do you to own the stars?
- It does me the good of making me rich.
- What good is it to be rich?
Because...
I don't know.
But how can you own the stars?
When you find a diamond that doesn't belong to anyone, it's yours.
If you get an idea before anyone else, it's yours.
So I got the idea of owning the stars.
You want to stay here? Fine.
You can help me count.
But if I owned a flower,
I could do something for it.
What can you do for the stars?
You wouldn't understand.
You're a child.
Gimme, how can you
Gimme, understand
Gimme, gimme,
Financial stuff?
Gimme, your supply
Gimme, my demand
Mentally is gigantial stuff
Gimme oodles of
Gimme boodles of
I don't care what
But give me more
You're too poor and immature to know
What there are gimme-gimmes for
Why, you're
Why, you're
You're a child
You're a child
You're too darling and dopey and mild
You're a nit
Half a wit
Speaking wisdom-wise
Private enterprise
Is too big
For a twig of a child
Oh, stocks and bonds!
I've lost me place!
Now I shall have to start all over again.
Here, add up these figures.
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm searching for knowledge.
Oh, good.
You've come to the right place.
It's been said that I am the greatest historian in history.
That's wonderful, sir.
Who said it?
I said it. I wrote it.
I read it. It's printed.
Consequently, it's fact.
It's history.
And now that you're here,
I shall put you down.
In history, I mean.
- Where did you come from?
- From another planet, sir.
- What was it called?
- I don't know, sir.
Oh, good, I'll give it a name.
I like making things up.
That's my job, making things up.
I'm an historian.
Let me see. Planet...
Alice! Do you like that?
Oh, no, sir. The planet Alice?
I don't like it at all.
No wonder you left it.
Here. Read my latest, an official version of the French Revolution.
The other ones are now totally inoperative.
Is that the truth, sir?
- What?
- The truth.
How do you spell it?
Never mind, sir.
I don't think I'd better stay.
Right. Wipe!
Left. Left. Left.
Shoulders back. Left. Left. Left.
Left. Left. On your feet, boy.
On your feet.
Where's your arm, boy? Where?
- My arm?
- The colors. The colors.
The flag.
Sir, I don't see anyone.
How could you?
There's no one there, silly ass.
Get those shoulders back. Back. Back!
Not that much. Watch it.
Stand easy.
Welcome to the base.
State your business.
I'm trying to learn about life, sir.
- Learn about what?
- Life.
Life? Oh, life. That.
Yes, of course.
Company, double-quick march!
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.
You want to know what life is about?
Dying! That's what it's all about.
Die like a hero, boy.
That's the way to live. Company, halt!
Boy, this is your lucky day.
We just happen to have an opening.
There's not a blankety-blank soldier in the whole army. Just a general, me.
I can outthink the enemy but just can't fight them.
Enemy? What enemy?
There isn't any, dunce!
You've got to have your army first.
Then you find your enemy.
Company, on your stomachs! Crawl!
Join up, lad.
The army needs you, your country needs you, and most of all, I need you.
Every young man wants to be a soldier.
Speak up, boy. Any questions?
Which way is the next planet?
The next planet?
Oh, the next planet. It is called...
You know, it's that round thing.
It's called...
Dirt. No.
Mud.
No. Earth!
That's it, Earth. Bring up the cannon!
- Company, on your...
- Which way is it?
- Which way is what?
- Earth.
Earth? Oh, Earth.
That way. Crawl, men!
Shoulders back! Shoulders down!
What about it, boy...?
Come back!
Who said that?
Who are you?
Be my friend.
I'm alone.
"What a queer planet," I thought.
Everyone says the same thing.
Just about.
That was just one year ago, and all I've learned since I left her is that I should never have left her.
All of those little games of hers,
I didn't see all of the affection that was underneath.
One should never listen to flowers, should one?
I wouldn't know.
My experience is limited.
Oh, I have met a Daisy
But where we met is hazy
And I have walked the streets
With Marguerites
And clinging vines beside me
Oh, I've met a lot of those
But I never met a Rose
There's often been a Heather
An armful altogether
And I have even met
A Violet
Who almost satisfied me
Yes, I've met every kind that grows
But I never met a Rose
Among the Dahlias
I often dally
I left a Lily in the valley
But now and then, I ponder
And wonder as I wander
Among the fields and shrub
Perhaps the trouble is...
Who knows?
That I never met a Rose
Never, never met a Rose
Perhaps you werert really looking for one.
Perhaps.
While roaming through the clover
Could I have passed her over?
When all is said and done
Am I the one to blame?
Who knows?
That I never met a Rose
Never, never met a Rose
Good morning.
Good morning.
Are you feeling all right?
Why don't you rest for a little while.
I can't. We've run out of water.
Unless I can get this thing off the ground...
But I will.
Don't worry, I will.
- I'm not worried.
- Good.
We'll get some water from the well.
Well? What well?
- Out there.
- What?
- Did you see an oasis?
- No, but there must be one out there.
No.
We could get lost and never find water and never make it back to the plane.
No, I'd rather bet on the motor.
At least we know it can work.
- Where are you going?
- To the well.
I said we were staying here.
This way.
Why not this way?
Or that way or that way?
This way.
Coming?
This is suicide, don't you understand? Suicide.
Then maybe I won't have to find my friend The Snake.
- What are you saying?
- It doesn't matter.
It does matter. What snake?
I'll tell you about him later.
- Tell me now.
- You can't draw while you're walking.
The stars are beautiful because of a flower I can't see.
Why is the desert
So lovely to see?
Why is the desert
So lovely to see?
There is a reason
Lovely to tell
Because the desert
Is hiding a well
What makes the desert
So lovely at night?
What makes the desert
So lovely at night?
Millions of reasons
Tell me just one
At night, the desert
Is hiding the sun
Look! Look!
It's water.
Why am I happy?
We're dying of thirst
Why am I happy?
We're dying of thirst
- Why are you happy?
- Why do you think?
Because there's plenty
Of water to drink
Why was the desert
So lovely before?
Why was it lovely
But not anymore?
Water was hiding
No one could see
But now the water
Is hiding in me
- You mustrt forget your promise.
- What promise?
You know, a muzzle for my sheep.
I won't forget.
But first, I want to hear more about that snake.
- Now?
- Now.
Very well, then.
I met him in a tree at the edge of the desert, not far from here.
There are some hills here.
He was the first real person I met when I landed here.
And until I met someone else,
I thought everyone on Earth was a snake.
I arrived on the other side of the tree.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
You're talking to the wrong end.
You're a funny animal.
You're nothing but a tail.
Where's the rest?
- I'm not an animal.
- What are you?
What am I?
I'm a snake.
- I'm enchanted.
- Well, you should be.
You're all cold and slimy.
Thank you. It runs in the family.
Could you tell me what I've landed on?
Yes. This sunny section of the solar system is called the Sahara.
The name of this planet is Sahara?
No, no, no, no. This simmering spot of singing sand is called the Sahara.
The whole silly, stupid, smelly sphere is called the Earth.
Oh, good. I thought I'd come to the wrong place.
Oh, you have.
Listen.
You look like a nice fellow.
Why don't you take off your sword and stay a while.
You seem like a smart, sensible sort.
Why did you swing down to this sorry, sleazy swamp?
- I'm trying to learn something.
- I see.
Well, sir, this speck in space is a scholastic sewer.
All that you can learn here is sorrow. Sorrow.
If I were you, I'd scram.
I can't, my flock of birds have flown away.
- So?
- They brought me here.
I see.
Listen, you are so lucky that you met me.
Why am I lucky?
Well, you see, if someday, any day, you want to see your own small, sparkling star again,
I may have a solution.
You see, I have this special... sting.
It's almost painless, and it can send you scooting out of this sad slum and sailing into the sweet, sunny, splendiferous sky.
Really?
If you would like to cure the fever
Called life
Get some relief from all the struggle
And strife
The grandest medicine
That I can propose
Is under your nose
A snake in the grass
If you would like a spot
Where life never goes
Where you can leave your body
Home in your clothes
The finest travel agent
You'll ever meet
Is right at your feet
A snake in the grass
One sting
And you can say goodbye
To all of your friends
One sting
And you'll be singing
As your spirit ascends
All's well that ends
So any day or night
Wherever you are
If you would like to take
A trip to a star
The quickest transportation
Yet known to Man
Is none other than
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
If you would like to leave
That inuman race
And take up residence
Out yonder, in space
When you are ready
To go traveling on
Sit right down upon
A snake in the grass
One sting
Is quite enough to make you
Happy and free
One sting
And you'll discover
How relaxed you can be
Posthumously
And while you're wandering through
The heavenly blue
If you should see the Lord come
Strolling in view
Go up and say you bring him
Best wishes from his fallen old chum
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
One sting.
It's almost painless.
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
A snake in the grass
I'll be waiting.
Wait a minute.
Just a moment.
Are you looking for that snake in order to do away with yourself?
I can't get back to my planet any other way.
It's too far, and my birds have disappeared.
Well, of all the...
You...
Now, you listen to me. That snake's poisoned you against the Earth.
- It's not what The Snake said.
- He's hated us since the world began.
- It's what The Fox said.
- I'll tell you right now, you're not going to allow yourself to be poisoned. Is that clear?
- What fox?
- The fox I met after I met The Snake.
I see.
You certainly got yourself mixed up with a strange crowd.
All right, let's have it.
- Where did you meet The Fox?
- In a garden of roses.
How many roses in the garden,
I don't know how many roses, but if it's too difficult to draw...
No. No. Not at all.
Let's get every detail of this whole sordid nonsense out in the open.
When she finds out there are millions of flowers that look just like her, it will break her heart.
Good morning.
I thought I was rich.
I thought I had the most unique flower in all the world.
But all I had was a common rose.
A common rose and three volcanoes that came up to my knees.
And one of them was extinct at that.
That doesn't make me a very great prince, does it?
Good morning.
Good morning.
You're a prince?
Yes.
I'm a fox.
I'm sad. Would you play with me?
- No.
- Why not? It'll be fun.
Where are the others?
- What others?
- The other hunters.
There's no one here but me.
Please play with me.
I won't harm you.
- Then why do you have a gun?
- I don't have a gun.
- You must. You're a human being.
- I'm from another planet.
- Arert there guns on your planet?
- No.
Really?
- Are there hunters on your planet?
- No.
- Any chickens?
- No.
- Oh, well, nothing's perfect.
- Let's play hide-and-seek.
I can't play with you.
- I'm not tamed.
- What do you mean, "tamed"?
Can't you stay put? I'm getting dizzy.
Sorry. I just don't wish to become extinct.
Do you mean, if I move, you will disappear again?
- Of course.
- Why?
You're a human. I'm a fox.
I hunt chickens, you hunt foxes.
- But I don't.
- You're a human, and you also lie.
But I don't lie.
Then you're inuman.
To be tamed...
Let me know before you move.
See if this clears it up. Underneath the prince, you're a little boy.
Just like a million other little boys.
I'm a fox.
Just like a million other foxes.
But if you tame me...
...I won't be like all the other foxes, and you won't be like the little boys.
I'll be unique to you, and you to me.
- You understand?
- Sort of.
- Where are you?
- You moved.
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.
I have a very monotonous life.
I hunt chickens.
Men hunt me. They come, I hide.
They leave, I come out.
That's all.
But if you tamed me, everything would be different.
- Even the wheat fields.
- The wheat fields?
Of course.
I don't like bread, so I don't care about wheat. Wheat is the color of gold.
Like your hair. So if you tamed me,
I'd start to care about wheat
Like your hair. So if you tamed me,
I'd start to care about wheat because it would remind me of you.
I'm going to sit down.
What would I have to do?
Well, every day, you would come and sit where you're sitting now.
You'd always come at the same time.
At, let's say, 4 in the afternoon.
I could start to get excited about... Oh, about 3:00.
If you came at any old time,
I couldn't get keyed up.
But what would I do at 4:00?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Of course not. If you did, I'd get frightened and I wouldn't come out.
It's like this.
At first, I'll hide behind the trees.
Trembling...
...as I do in winter.
In time
I'll start to feel at ease
Show my face
And we'll
- Beginter
- "Beginter"?
Get closer.
And closer.
And closer.
We'll go a glance at a time
A small advance at a time
We'll be afraid a bit
And shy a bit
Avoid each other's eye a bit
Less often each day
The ice will soften each day
As we get closer
And closer and closer
We'll go a blush at a time
A happy flush at a time
Begin to laugh a bit
And stare a bit
And walk around on air a bit
As gaily we grow
As night and daily we grow
A little closer
And closer and closer
And then one day
There'll come a day
A Christmas Eve
Midsummer Day
A moment when
Right there and then
We're gonna touch
Then we'll jump miles at a time
A million smiles at a time
Begin to love a lot
And live a lot
And give and give and give a lot
Away we will go
And every day we will grow
A little closer and closer
And closer and closer
And closer and closer
And closer and closer
All the time
And then one day
There will come a day
A Christmas Eve
Midsummer Day
A moment when
Right there and then
We're gonna touch
Begin to laugh a bit and stare a bit
And walk around on air a bit
As gaily we grow
As night and daily we grow
A little closer and closer
And closer
Away we will go
And every day we will grow
- A little closer
- And closer
- And closer
- And closer
And closer and closer
And closer and closer
All the time
After I tamed him, we stayed together for quite a while.
But then one day,
I had to say goodbye.
I think I'm going to cry.
I didn't want to make you unappy, but you asked me to tame you.
- I know.
- Then I haven't done you much good.
- It's all been a waste of time.
- No.
Because you wasted so much time on me...
...you made me feel very important.
But now I feel sort of responsible for you.
I should have warned you that would happen.
You always feel responsible for what you've tamed.
The moment he said that,
I understood everything.
He wasrt like all the other foxes in the world anymore.
I tamed him, and now he was unique, at least to me.
And my flower wasrt like all those other flowers, because I had fetched her a screen and put a glass bowl over her at night and listened when she grumbled, and now she was my rose.
And I was responsible for her, and
I had to go back and take care of her.
I brought you a present.
It's a secret.
So I wrote it down.
The last time I saw him, he was sitting in a wheat field.
What was the secret?
It's only with the heart that one can see clearly.
What's essential...
...is invisible to the eye.
It works!
Eureka! It works!
I need air!
It works.
It works!
Wait.
Don't.
My God. What have you done?
No.
Don't.
I'm glad you've repaired your engine.
Now you can go back home.
- Yes.
- I, too, am going back home.
You must keep your promise.
- What promise?
- You know, a muzzle for my sheep.
I'm responsible for this flower.
Please. You promised.
You also forgot the fence.
It's a very nice muzzle and fence.
Thank you.
You're cold as ice.
Are you afraid?
Please leave me.
I can't.
I won't.
I don't want you to suffer.
I'll look as if I'm dead, but it won't be true.
It's just that it's too far to carry this body with me.
You understand, don't you?
This part of me will be like an old, abandoned shell.
There's nothing sad about old shells, is there?
My star is so small
I can't show you where it is.
I'm going back there now, but before
I do, I want to give you something.
All I want is to hear you laugh again.
You will hear me laugh.
More than you ever did before, because on one of those stars,
I'll be laughing, but you won't know which one.
So they'll all be laughing, all the stars.
It will be like a bell that's hanging from every star in the sky.
There now, that's all.
Little Prince
From who knows where
Was it a star?
Was it a prayer?
With every smile
You clear the air
So I can see
Oh, Little Prince
Don't take your smile
Away from me
When you came
My day was done
And then your laugh
Turned on the sun
Oh, Little Prince
Now, to my wonder and surprise
All the hopes and dreams
I lived among
When this heart of mine
Was wise and young
Shine for me again
Little Prince
In your eyes
Please, Little Prince
Don't take your smile away from me
When you came
My day was done
And then your laugh
Turned on the sun
Oh, Little Prince
Now, to my wonder and surprise
All the hopes and dreams
I lived among
When this heart of mine
Was wise and young
Shine for me again
Little Prince
In your eyes
Where are you?
I won't leave without you!
Oh, my God.
It never happened.
He wasrt here.
It never happened.
This is Nargis... the younger sister of Nawab Chand.
Her mesmerising voice...
...and the tinkling of her dancing bells are a sensation all over.
There are scores of romantics who yearn for her attention... and she doesn't bother in the least.
But yes... there is this man whose arrival...
...makes her gloomy in her unholy surroundings.
Her soul pleads with him... to take her away from there.
The restless love in Shahab's eyes convinces her that...
I won't let you wither... in this infamous place.
I'll come one night and take you away from this hell.
"Finally, the night arrived."
The night of promise...
...which Nargis had been...
...restlessly looking forward to.
Say something.
I hope you're actually present.
Yes.
And I'm close to you?
Yes. You're close to me.
And you're taking me to your house.
Your house is built on a very elevated level.
Completely white...
...and dressed as your bride in a red ensemble...
...I am alighting from a palanquin... in your courtyard.
Uncle! Uncle!
- Stop!
How dare you marry a prostitute and bring her home?
Father! You cannot use such abusive words against her.
She's my beloved and the daughter-in-law of your family.
Shut up! You cannot malign my family with this society girl.
She's not my daughter-in-law.
She's your wrongdoing!
O Allah!
Please stop!
Where do you want to go?
- Take me to a graveyard.
Poor Nargis!
Having alighted from the palanquin...
...she is standing all alone in this scary jungle of death.
"There go all her desires and dreams..."
...leaving her helpless.
Shahab searched for his oppressed... bride in every...
...nook and corner.
Shahab's promises to Nargis are now going against him...
"...and consequently, he is roaming around in vain."
And here...
"Nargis' sobbing life, having been drenched in tears..."
...is coming to an end in these...
...deserted days and still nights.
The gold coins are pure.
It must be some minor dirt.
- Whose bangle is this?
- What's the matter?
- It belongs to me.
- To you?
Yes. It belongs to me.
- But it belongs to somebody else!
- Whose is it?
How should I describe her?
God knows who she is.
She's living in our cemetry since the past l0 months.
She doesn't reveal where she has come from and what's her misfortune.
Only God knows what is ailing her.
She doesn't even weep.
She is just dying silently.
Is that unfortunate woman a blonde?
Yes. She is a blonde.
Take me to her. That unlucky woman is my sister.
Where is she?
O sister!
You're dead?
I wonder how you must have undergone...
...such a severe punishment because of your innocence.
I wonder how you must have tolerated...
...this deserted place of death.
I wonder how much you must've wept.
These are some of her belongings.
You may sell it off.
Sir!
- What is it?
- I've found the book...
...which you were searching for.
So you got it?
Please show it to me.
- Tell me... what should I pay?
- You may give whatever you like.
"All right. Here, take it."
Whose letter is this which didn't reach its destination?
Now you'll deliver it to it's destination?
Why not? It's a noble deed.
I'll surely deliver it.
I was not fortunate enough that...
...I would've breathed my last at your door-step.
Neither was I fortunate that you'd take my dead body to the graveyard.
But I'd to leave your home and...
...find a graveyard for myself.
"Today, I'm leaving your unjust world."
You'll receive this letter tomorrow.
"The moment you read it, come over here..."
...and take away this innocent child from my desolate lap.
She is your child.
Now we will meet on the doomsday.
Goodbye...
Your sick... Nargis.
She had a daughter too.
Yes. But her sister took her away.
Her sister...?
Get out of this whorehouse.
You may wield your influence elsewhere.
Don't you know who I am?
"If you ever step here again,
I'll order your limbs to be smashed."
A Mr. Shahbuddin is calling you downstairs.
Who're you? I didn't recognise you.
I'm Shahbuddin.
I see. So you're Shahbuddin?
My brother-in-law!
Tell me... what brings you here again?
Which other culprit are you searching for this time?
Now which prostitute do you intend to rescue from hell?
Nargis wrote me a letter when she was dying.
I received the letter seventeen years later.
She has mentioned about my daughter.
I understand that she's here.
- So you've come to see her?
- I've come to take her away.
I see. So you've come to take her away!
Some graveyard must've made you a request to bring her dead body.
All right. Take her away.
She's your daughter.
How can I refuse?
But right now... she is busy with her dance performance.
"Moreover, it's against your pride to take away your daughter..."
...from this infamous locality.
You may come back tomorrow morning.
Let's go.
Muscleman... why is it locked?
- They've gone away?
- When did they leave?
They left at dawn.
- Do you know where they went?
They've flown away from this perch.
Who knows where they may perch themselves?
Let's go.
Give me a paan.
Since you chew paan free-of-charge everyday...
...you should twist your moustache downwards.
Disguising ourselves as beggars...
...we see the spectacle at every step day after day.
Forgive me... I happened to come inside your compartment.
I could see your feet.
They're very beautiful.
Do not place them on the ground.
They will become dirty.
Your fellow-traveller.
I could see your feet.
They're very beautiful.
Do not place them on the ground.
They will become dirty.
Your fellow-traveller.
I sent the word that
I'm not a wife...
...that I'd weep in a corner of the house.
Why would I make my heart suffer?
"If one is interested, a person may come here."
"Otherwise, he may stay with his wife."
You've said it right.
- How wonderful!
Greetings.
Aunty has arrived.
Mother! Aunty has arrived!
- Greetings.
- God bless you.
It would be great fun.
- Greetings.
- Be happy!
Come.
I hope everything is fine.
Can I have some cold drinking water?
We have cold water.
Bring it over here.
Dibban is not to be seen.
Where is she?
She's sick.
- Is Dibban sick?
- Yes.
- When did you arrive?
- Just a while ago.
I see...
- Have you come alone?
- No.
I've come with my aunt.
What's ailing you?
You're so thoughtless.
I write so many letters...
...and yet you send me a reply several months later.
Residents of Delhi aren't believed to be hostile!
How did you become one?
You may scold me later. Rest comfortably for the time being.
But how come you've arrived all of a sudden?
No letter... no telegram?
"I don't know. Day-before-yesterday, somebody summoned aunty..."
"...outside the brothel. When she returned, she was worried."
I cannot sit with her in any brothel now.
I'll be traced.
"If I could find some mansion separately, I would be relieved."
What's so difficult about finding a mansion?
You could get the pink palace...
...which Nawab Hashmat Shah had given away to Gauhar Jaan.
I don't have the capacity to be able to buy the Nawab's pink palace.
The Nawab has passed away now.
And Gauhar Jaan is neck-deep in debt.
The palace is being auctioned now.
The bid may reach upto one lakh or one and a half lakh rupees.
Don't you have that much money?
That much!?
The train is leaving.
Do you need something?
Take this. You have the pink palace now.
I've finalised everything.
"From tomorrow, she'll live in the palace along with him."
And till the danger from
Shahabuddin blows over...
...she'll be recognised as
Gauhar Jaan's niece.
- Who is she?
- She's fire.
Yes. The entire city is burning with this fire.
But this fire is yet to affect me.
It already has. You'll not be able to keep it under control till night.
It has been so wonderful!
Welcome.
Please be seated here.
He's the affluent Nawab Zafar
Ali Khan from Panipat.
My greetings to you.
Please see if it'll be delayed further.
All right.
Why're you sitting there?
Please sit here.
I'm better off here.
What must be the time now?
- It'll be three o'clock soon.
You may go and sleep now.
Forgive me... I happened to come inside your compartment.
I could see your feet.
They're very beautiful.
Do not place them on the ground.
They will become dirty.
Your fellow-traveller.
Collect it with both arms.
He's a very romantic wealthy man.
Whichever brothel he climbs...
...the stairs of such brothels get to be made of gold.
Folks! Now our queen mother'll dance!
- I'll dance?
- Bring the musical instruments.
Come on. You should dance.
You dance so well.
Where do I dance well now?
That was ages ago.
"If the girls are insisting, why don't you teach them a couple of steps?"
Hurry up! Bring the instrument.
Yes. I'll begin now.
- Greetings.
- Bring it over.
Keep it.
What is this thing?
- Show them.
"The Nawab has sent this carpet worth 36,000 rupees..."
...as a redressal for last night's incident.
A blacksmith's one blow is mightier than a goldsmith's hundred blows.
This is especially for your amusement.
I'd happened to tell Nawab that she's very fond of birds.
And pronto! He sent this for her.
It's priceless. It even sings.
- Is it?
- Hear the bird sing.
It's not a bird.
It's our dear sister.
You shameless girl!
How can you embarrass her?
Are you of her age?
- Senseless girl!
"How can you behave like this?
After all, she's her elder sister."
Take it and hang it there.
I don't think I've to go into details.
"As it is, you're an experienced person."
Gosh! He has arrived.
- Who has arrived?
- The Nawab.
Please be seated.
What's the matter?
Is there no gathering today?
A gathering is scheduled.
But people didn't come.
Perhaps because of yesterday's incident.
"Yes, perhaps."
"But why do you worry? If people didn't come, so be it."
A moonlit night is far brighter than a star-lit night.
You've made a very accurate observation.
It's a fact.
Go and call her.
Bring along Shabnam too to give you company.
"I'd heard that affluent, wealthy men are very meticulous in conduct."
I hadn't seen it earlier.
I saw it yesterday.
Thanks. I don't chew paan.
I remembered that thing.
That thing? Then let's go.
My greetings to you.
Greetings.
I suppose you're well.
Yes. By your grace.
People do swear by you.
But did anybody...
...remove the effect of the evil eye?
Ensure that it's removed. I might caste an evil eye on you.
- Did you get it made?
- Yes.
Give it to me.
Fool! Go and remove it from inside.
>From inside?
I found it.
I could see your feet.
They're very beautiful.
Do not place them on the ground.
They will become dirty.
O Lord! I'm also your slave.
You're defeated now.
Two and this is seven.
- Where's she?
- She's in the bathroom.
- And this...
- Come and play.
You may play. I don't know how to play this game.
It's your move now.
Who is it? Saheb Jaan?
- When did you come?
- I just came.
Is it Saaheb Jaan standing?
Tell me... I hope you're fine.
"Well, yes. Morning comes, evening comes..."
...life is just drifting away.
You should come over here sometimes.
I'll come some day.
Excuse me... I needed something from you.
What was it?
I'm going to a dance performance tomorrow.
I'll need your head ornament for a day.
I'll return it day-after-tomorrow.
Of course! You may take it.
"If you like, you may not return it later."
- Would you like to chew paan?
- No.
Hey! These are the same old ones.
I thought the Nawab must've gifted it to you.
"If I'd asked for something else now, I would've got it too."
Really... I'djust been remembering you.
I hear you passed the whole night inside the same blanket?
And that the poor Nawab got entangled in his own carpet?
I'm tired of hearing the same thing repeatedly.
Are you tense about something?
Yes. It's something like it.
What is it?
Just pull the curtains.
Yes... what's the matter?
"Since several days, I get the feeling that I'm changing."
As if I'm undergoing an unknown journey...
...and that I'm going somewhere.
I'm leaving everything.
Saheb Jaan is slipping away...
...and I'm being distanced from Saheb Jaan.
- Who is it?
- Who?
The one whom I'm asking?
Tell me!
How should I say who it is?
It's a peculiar incident.
What is it?
"Every night, at 3 o'clock..."
...a train derails from the tracks and passes through my heart.
And it gives me a message.
What message?
This message is not meant for you.
What?
No. It is meant for me.
I found it kept near my feet.
You're right. But you must not be wearing the bells at that time.
If you had been wearing the bells...
...how would anyone have asked you not to keep your feet on the ground?
My dear one...
It is indeed a message.
But it is misdirected.
"And tonight, he is celebrating."
I'll come in the evening and take her away.
All right.
- Where from are you returning?
- I'd been to meet Dibban.
Come over here. Look what all he has brought with him.
I'm coming.
Gosh!
I'm very tired.
Go tell her that I'm very tired.
All right.
This message is not meant for you.
Be seated.
Be comfortable.
What's the matter?
What?
Why do you seem to appear as if...
"...you're not Saheb Jaan, but somebody else?"
But you've bought me as Saheb Jaan.
Yes. I did buy you.
But I've suffered a loss.
My heart seems to say as if you're a stolen property.
As if it would be a crime to buy you.
Why're you looking there?
- I've a request.
- What is that?
- Change the topic.
- All right.
But look towards me.
Do you remember that poem?
- Which one?
Hearing which travellers forget their route.
I'd happened to meet somebody enroute.
I remember.
What happened?
What's this?
- Elephants have come.
- What is it?
- Elephants!
"It's a stormy night, and I'm travelling."
There's nobody in the compartment besides me.
But on the opposite berth...
...my enchanting memory is turning over once again.
And the beautiful feet decorated with henna...
...continue to make me restless even today.
What is it? What's the name of this condition?
Love.
O Lord!
He's standing close to me.
And I'm feeling suffocated.
You'll continue to stare at me in amazement...
...and I'll die without
...even glancing at you once.
"I'll die on your bed, in front of your eyes."
Turn your face.
Give me some respite...
...so that I can heave a sigh of relief...
...and glance at you once.
It's such a strange incident.
As if somebody would be narrating a story.
Greetings.
Not there... this way.
I'm stunned upon finding you here.
"In this jungle, on this distant island..."
...who has left you in the solitude of my tent?
Say something.
Who're you?
What is your name?
Name... my name!
You didn't reply.
Who am I? And how I've come here?
I don't remember anything.
This night will make me go crazy.
May I try to remind you something?
Perhaps you might remember something from your lost memories.
It was a rainy night.
You were travelling in a train.
I happened to come inside your compartment.
You were sleeping.
"You continued to sleep, but your feet awakened..."
...and they wreaked havoc on my senses.
You must've received my note near your feet in which...
...I mentioned about your feet.
You must've read it.
Try to remember.
I could see your feet.
They're very beautiful.
Do not place them on the ground.
They will become dirty.
This message is not meant for you.
What?
No. It is meant for me.
I found it kept near my feet.
You're right. But you must not be wearing the bells at that time.
Did you remember anything?
Excuse me...
Yes?
I'm going away from you for some time.
Where?
Not very far. Just across that river.
"But after reaching there,
I'll send my messenger to you."
He'll care for you till I return.
By when will you return?
- I'll return before dusk.
Make sure that you return before nightfall.
I'll surely return.
Excuse me.
You were about to say something?
Do return before nightfall.
I will.
"Yes, Sir."
I'm coming.
Go over to my tent immediately.
My guest is staying there.
Take along food-stuff with you.
"Till I don't return, you remain there."
All right.
Look! Is she the one?
Yes. She's the one.
Thank God!
Sir!
Here I come.
The sun hasn't set yet.
There's nobody here.
There's nobody here?
Greetings.
Yes...!?
You may begin.
You were about to say something?
Do return before nightfall.
I will.
How wonderful!
It's a wonderful beginning.
We poor things have had it today.
You may say that doomsday will be coming soon.
You're right. But ask Saheb Jaan when the doomsday will arrive.
Did you see?
Didn't I tell you not to hold a dance performance...
...till her fever subsides completely?
Her body is still warm.
How can she dance?
You gentlemen have been unnecessarily inconvenienced.
I'm leaving.
Her helplessness is a such a defence that...
...though she made go away a hundred times...
...yet I returned as many times.
Here! Take this.
You may ward off the evil eye from Saheb Jaan on my behalf.
Who is it?
Hey! Didn't you recognise me?
I'm the contractor.
Listen to me.
I've been summoned.
Why're you so worried?
How strange!
What happened?
Perhaps somebody has been run over by the train.
It's an accident.
"Really, when God protects, nobody can kill a person."
- Take the train behind.
- It's God's miracle!
You're right. But the engine driver too has stopped the train rightly.
Where were you lost?
I wonder where I roam around.
I don't remember anything.
You happen to meet me automatically...
...and sometimes you get distanced again.
"I wonder if it's my dream, or have I gone mad?"
I don't know when this dream would be shattered...
...and which desolate place would I end up in?
I wonder where I'll regain consciousness.
Wherever you'll regain consciousness...
...my eyes will be watching you.
And the key to your dreams will be found in my eyes.
Yes.
Stop crying. Or you'll get a severe beating from me.
"Greetings, grandmother."
"Greetings, Mother.
Greetings to everyone."
May you live long.
Please come and be seated.
Everybody is so surprised.
Yes.
We're indeed surprised.
About who this person accompanying me is?
Yes. Who is she?
I too don't know who she is.
She's an oppressed girl who has lost her memory.
Come over here.
She appears to belong to a decent family.
That's why I've brought her here.
"And till she remembers her identity, she will stay here."
"Of course, why not?"
- How're you?
- Come on. Take breakfast now.
I'll take breakfast.
Let me refresh myself.
Come on. Help me wash myself.
When are you offering bracelets to your sweeper woman?
Get married first. Then I'll offer you several bracelets.
I've already got married. How could
I've waited for you to marry?
You've already selected the girl.
You should get married now.
"Stop, will you?"
Where's grandfather?
He's gone to Hyderabad to fetch your Uncle?
- Hyderabad?
- Yes.
He's lying sick in the government hospital.
Why do you've to weep?
He's going to return home.
There should be celebrations to mark his return.
"Don't weep now. After all, grandpa will be fetching him back."
- Open the door.
- Who is it?
It's us.
"Greetings, Mother."
My son!
Uncle has arrived!
- Greetings.
- God bless you.
"- Greetings, Uncle.
- God bless you."
She has grown up very fast.
Arrange the food.
"- Greetings, Uncle.
- Oh! So you're here too!"
"When I arrived here, I was told that you were in Hyderabad."
- Be happy.
- I hope you're fine now.
Who is she?
- Greet him.
- May you live long.
Is she your bride?
- No. She's Arif's bride.
I see. So Arif got married!
We had to marry him.
We searched for you a lot.
But we didn't find you anywhere.
It's nice that he married.
My congratulations.
- You've married too?
- How can he marry?
"Till he doesn't choose a girl himself, he wouldn't marry."
Then select a girl. I'm very keen to see you married.
"Moreover, I'm not sure how long I'll live now."
Why do you say that? You'll live for many more years now.
It would be better if you select some girl.
- He has already selected a girl.
- Is it?
- She's sitting there.
- Be seated.
Who is it?
"- Greetings, grandpa.
- When did you come?"
- I too arrived today.
- Be seated.
Who's that girl?
She is with me.
"Girls, you may go."
Yes.
- Who is she?
She's an unknown girl.
- She's with you?
- Yes.
- What do you mean?
Even I don't know who she is.
She's an oppressed girl who has lost her memory.
"Incidentally, she has come into my refuge."
But who will believe what you're saying?
I don't care.
You may not be worried.
But I'm worried about you.
Those who get burnt with milk...
...they even drink curd-milk with caution.
It's a pity that people get burnt with milk too.
Do you want to enter into an argument with me?
You need not argue with me.
A girl who doesn't have a name or an address...
...why is she in your company?
It's because she is under my care.
And it's not a crime.
It's not a crime. But it will bring me disrepute.
No. You cannot lose any reputation.
"If anybody will lose his reputation, it will be me."
Who're you? Don't I have any relationship with you?
You've a relationship. But you've no connection with this matter of mine.
I've no connection?
"If I don't have any connection, why've you brought her to my home?"
"Undoubtedly, I've made a mistake."
I'd forgotten that people in this family have to...
...seek permission from you even before taking every breath.
And your progeny doesn't walk on the ground which is created by God.
"Rather, your progeny crawls on your palm."
Let's go away from here.
This mansion is built with quicksand...
...and it cannot provide shelter to anybody.
It's a very dangerous place.
Wait!
Perhaps you've forgotten about yourself for ever.
I'm convinced now that you're nothing but my destiny.
Look over there.
The entire world is bowing at your feet.
And they're all saluting you.
O Lord! Please remain quiet.
Don't kill me so lovingly.
I confess that
I remember who I am.
Who are you?
Who are you?
- I'm an innocent woman.
That's what you'd told me.
"You came, you wrote a note..."
...and then you never let me sleep peacefully thereafter.
"Every night, you have been calling out and passing through."
"Every single day, you've been pulling away my soul from my body."
I would have died aspiring for you.
But you never let me die too.
I would've run away.
But your tent surrounded me.
"You came, and your heartbeats didn't even let me say..."
...that I'm a prostitute.
Please stop the carriage.
- Make one garland.
- A garland?
All right. Please be seated.
Make an attractive one.
You mean you're not recognising me?
How wonderful!
But why so much displeasure that you're not even greeting me?
Who are you?
I see... so she's with you!
Come here.
"- Yes, Sir.
- Who're you?"
- Tell him my name.
- He's Hashim Khan.
"No, Sir."
Now you'll have to reveal your name too.
I'm a stranger here.
And I'm a decent person.
Come on. Proceed.
Who's he?
How many people's name will you ask me?
What's your intention?
- I want to ask you your name.
Please stop the carriage.
Let me introduce myself to him.
You were asking me my name?
Get down.
Leave the reins.
Leave the reins.
- Who's he?
- He's some ruffian.
She's some whore.
She's a heady stuff.
What's your name?
What's your profession?
I asked you your profession.
Is it important to tell you that?
"- Yes, it is.
- I'm a forest officer."
Constable... you may go.
It doesn't befit an officer of your rank...
...to have had to come to a police station.
It's a matter of regret.
"Anyway, you may go."
Bring in Mr. Hashim Khan.
"Wherever you take me, my notoriety will follow close behind."
This sky is my enemy.
It'll never come to an end.
Where are you taking me so that you may hide me?
To the place where your sky ends.
- Greetings.
- Greetings.
- What can I do for you?
- I've come to marry her.
All right.
"Gentlemen, please attend this marriage."
And what's your name?
- She's some whore.
Her name is Pakeezah.
Do you approve of your...
...marriage to Salim Ahmed Khan?
Do you approve of your...
...marriage to Salim Ahmed Khan?
- Say yes.
- You may remain quiet.
Let me ask her.
I'm questioning you for the final time.
Don't feel shy.
Say yes or no.
Do you approve of your...
...marriage to Salim Ahmed Khan?
No! No!
"Has Saheb Jaan returned?
- Yes, she has returned."
Yes. My vagabond dead body...
...has returned to be buried in this colourful tomb.
Hush! What dead body?
Yes. Every whore is a dead body.
I'm a dead body. And you too!
This marketplace is a graveyard...
...of women whose souls are dead...
...but the bodies remain alive.
These mansions are our tombs...
...in which the living coffins of we dead women...
...are kept after being decorated.
Our coffins are left open...
...so that...
Keep quiet. Keep quiet.
I'm a restless dead body of one such open coffin...
...which is lured by life again and again.
But now I've got fed up of my waywardness...
...and this treachery on the part of life.
I've got tired of it.
What has happened?
Did he reject you?
No. I left him.
I afflicted him with a serious wound...
...and made my exit from his heavenly heart.
Why?
I got scared.
The ground of that world was such that...
"...wherever I set foot, the ground used to sink at the same spots."
Look over there... that kite is so much like me.
"It's cut away, like I am."
This gentleman has brought for you a letter from some Mr. Salim Ahmed.
On the 26th of this month...
...I'm celebrating grandly the ceremony of forgetting you.
It's also the day when I'll be married.
You're requested to perform a dance on this auspicious occasion.
I hear that you're known all over for your dancing and singing.
Your's Salim...
The feet which remained hidden in my heart...
...I'll see those feet dancing in everybody's presence.
Will I be able to see?
Come and see the sight of you being insulted.
She's your own honour...
...which is dancing amidst people of your community in your own home.
It's an assassination of your self-respect.
"It's your daughter's blood, on which you've put your feet."
My daughter's blood!
My daughter...?!
My father!
Did you see how that oppressed woman's blood has bloomed...
...whose blood had dried up on your sleeves?
What nonsense!
You cannot defame me by making this allegation.
It's not an allegation.
It's the punishment for your false pride.
- Recognise her.
- Move away!
- Brother!
- What're you doing?
O Lord! My son!
Uncle!
Uncle!
Uncle!
How did this happen?
She's my daughter.
"No, Shahabuddin."
She is still the daughter of Nargis.
She cannot be called your daughter until...
...a marriage procession doesn't come for her marriage...
...and until her marriage palanquin is lifted by you from my brothel.
I'll take the marriage procession.
My procession will go there.
Take me along with you.
Take me at all cost... alongwith your marriage procession!
Uncle! You'll go alongwith the marriage procession.
The palanquin will be lifted at your hands.
I assure you. You'll surely go with the procession.
Her palanquin will surely be lifted at your hands.
Do you approve of this marriage?
Yes.
Silence!
Give your daughter the permission to leave.
Give her the permission.
"For thousands of years, a flower withers away without any recognition."
"Only then comes the one, truly worthy of praise."
Is it Saaheb Jaan standing?

You there, which way to Pepperinge Eye?
Couldn't say, sir. lt said on the wireless to paint out the signposts in case the Nazis drop in. l'm not a Nazi! l'm a British officer!
That's what you'd say if you was a Nazi, isn't it, sir?
Drive on, corporal.
Sorry to give you so many but you do have six bedrooms.
No trouble.
Anything to get the poor things away from those terrible bombings in London.
What about us?
- Oh, yes. What is your name?
- Rawlins, ma'am.
Oh, yes. Here we are. Carrie.
Charles.
Paul.
You're for Miss Price. l'm expecting her in.
- Call out the navy
- l won't be a moment.
Please don't touch anything.
Call out the tanks
From the Cliffs of Dover,
call up the gulls
And don't forget
the loyal territorials
But who's digging in here?
Who will defend
Every inch of England,
no matter what they send?
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,
that's who
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard
We wrote the story
of the old brigades
We know the glory
of yesterday's parades
Who's standing firm

- Halt!
- Carry on, sergeant.
Captain Greer, sir, from headquarters at Tidbury, here to check military preparations.
Tell them Pepperinge Eye has matters well in hand.
Nevertheless, l...
What on earth is that?
Good morning, General. l received your message, Mrs Hobday.
- l assume my parcel has arrived.
- lt's in the office.
How lovely.
- Who is that?
- Miss Price. Splendid woman.
Her late father served with me.
What does she burn in this? lt smells like sulphur.
Ridiculous! One can't make motor fuel out of sulphur!
Here we are. Another object from
Professor Emelius Browne in London.
- Thank you.
- ls it what you expected?
- l imagine so.
- He sent you a cat last time.
- Professor Browne is well?
- l haven't the faintest idea.
Are we to have the pleasure of meeting him? l doubt it. l don't know
Professor Browne personally.
- Was there something else?
- Yes. Would you come this way?
- l'm very anxious to get home.
- Come along, please.
- Get down, Charlie. l want a ride!
- Bash him one!
Stop it this instant!
Children, this is Miss Price.
Carrie, Charles and Paul Rawlins, all the way from London.
- How do you do?
- How are you, miss?
The government are trying to evacuate children into the country.
- Very sensible.
- Today they sent us 45.
And l've had to find homes for all of them at very short notice.
These are the last three. All right, children. Pick up your things.
You're not suggesting l take these children into my house?
- Exactly.
- That's quite out of the question.
Children and l don't get on. l'll believe you, miss.
Come on. Back to London.
Be quiet.
Besides, l have important work to do.
Miss Price, you do have that entire house to yourself.
According to the Ministry of
Civil Defence, you have no choice. l see. lf that is the case l shall take them into my house, with the understanding that you find another home as soon as possible.
Fine. Come along.
Good morning, Miss Price.
There they are!
Oh, Miss Price, what a charitable thing you are doing, taking in these poor unfortunates from the city.
- Hold this very carefully.
- l wonder if l may drop by later.
- Why?
- Consider their spiritual needs.
That won't be necessary.
They won't be with me for long.
My parcel, please.
Bring your things inside.
- Bit murky, ain't it?
- Yeah.
Not another house round here for miles.
- Wipe your feet.
- Big place, this.
- Who else lives here?
- l live alone. lt suits my purpose.
All right. Come along, everybody.
Sorry, miss. The cat startled us.
No need for alarm.
You just frightened him.
Yeah, he's scared to death.
You can see that!
- What do you call your cat?
- l don't give animals silly names. l call him Cosmic Creepers because that's the name he came with.
You will sleep in here.
This was my father's bedroom.
Be very careful of everything in it.
- You boys take the bed there.
- All right, miss.
- What was your name?
- Carrie, miss.
- You sleep in the sofa in there.
- Thank you, miss.
- ls that all you brought?
- We ain't exactly burdened down.
Travel light, that's us. l don't think this is going to work but it seems that l have no alternative.
We'll do our best, miss.
Really, we will.
Thank you, Carrie.
The bathroom is along the landing.
- Supper is at 6:00. You will wash...
- Wash?
You will wash yourselves otherwise there will be no supper. ls that clear?
A house of horror.
That's what we've come to.
Please don't bother to whisper. l'm exceptionally keen of hearing.
You are planning to run back to London.
Please do your plotting elsewhere where l shan't have to listen to it. l don't know much about what children eat.
You'll have to make do as l do. ls there anything in particular that you fancy?
Sausage and mash, bubble and squeak, toad in the hole, fried fish...
Anything at all.
You won't find any fried foods in this house.
- No fried food?
- No.
How do you keep your health?
Cabbage buds, rosehips, hyssop seed, elm bark, wattle yeast and stewed nettles.
''Dear Madam. With this shipment, the Emelius Browne
College of Witchcraft sends you its congratulations on qualifying for the first degree of your chosen calling.''
''You may now call yourself
'apprentice witch'.''
''Yours faithfully, Emelius Browne.''
My first broom.
Time to go. Everybody up.
Wake up, Paul.
We're going back to London.
Let's see how we fly this thing.
Here we are.
''Clasp the broom with both hands.''
Yes, of course.
''Never astride the broom.''
Oh, yes, of course.
''A witch is always a lady unless circumstances dictate otherwise.''
''Take an easy, graceful sideways position.''
Of course, that's much better.
An easy, graceful sideways position.
There we are. How's that?
''To start up the broom, your basic formula:
La kipo necriff scrumpet leech!'' l wasn't ready!
Now watch this.
Here we go. lt's going to be a little different this time.
All right. l know it's not ladylike.
What's the matter?
- How does she do that?
- She's a witch.
That's the sort of thing witches do.
She don't fly good, do she?
- She's crashed!
- Now's our chance to hop it!
- Suppose she's hurt.
- Go on! You can't hurt a witch.
Look out!
She's proper cross now.
Let's get away from here.
Hang on. l'm having a bit of a think.
A witch she is, says you.
Then let's use the old loaf, says l.
- Let's get back to London.
- What we have here is an opportunity.
She don't want anyone to know she's a witch, does she?
- Not ruddy likely.
- That's the opportunity.
And l intend to make the most of it. Come on.
- Bran porridge.
- Thank you, miss.
Very healthful, l'm sure!
- Hurt your foot, Miss Price?
- Just twisted my ankle.
- Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you. lt's nothing serious.
Lovely weather for flying last night.
Why did you say that, Charles?
Game's up, Miss Price.
We know what you are. l see.
Don't worry, Miss Price.
No one's gonna peach on you.
Thank you. l should be most grateful if you didn't tell anyone.
Course there would have to be one or two little changes made round here. l mean, l'd like to see an occasional sausage on the table here.
- A bit of strawberry jam.
- Charlie!
Let me handle this.
And another thing, Miss Price.
There will be no more of this wash, wash, wash, morning and night.
Anything else?
Now you mention it, l could do with a bit of lolly.
Lolly?
Cash. Cold, hard cash.
You must have buckets of it.
The most accomplished of witches can't make money out of thin air.
Have you ever heard of a rich witch?
Be that as it may, you don't want us to blab, do you?
Have you considered what danger you might be in? l am a witch, you know.
What will you do?
Turn me into a toad?
Lovely. A toad with pink eyes.
- l might just do that.
- Go on, then. l dare you.
Very well, Charles.
- You shouldn't have said that to her.
- She don't frighten me.
She can't even ride a proper broom.
Excuse me, Charles.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Oh, Charlie!
That's better than a toad!
That's a rabbit!
Bother! l never seem to be able to manage toads.
Stop! Leave him alone!
- Don't let Charlie get hurt.
- My spells don't last very long. l'm just an apprentice witch.
Look out, Charlie!
You flaming brute! l'll teach you to do that to me!
Let Cosmic Creepers alone.
Weren't his fault. l'm afraid it's my fault.
Bad enough not being able to manage a broom. l can't perform a simple, basic spell.
You dared her to do it. l don't see why we can't all be friends.
Maybe she's not a wicked witch.
Of course l'm not!
- See?
- lf only l could trust you.
You see, the work l'm doing is so important to the war effort.
- How do you mean?
- l mean exceptionally important.
Most secret.
What do you say, Charlie?
We can keep a secret.
Yeah. lf someone made it worth our while. l don't follow.
Simple. You give us something valuable to seal the pact.
Oh, Charlie, don't try to be clever again. lt's for our own protection, ain't it? lf we broke the pact, we'd have to give back the valuable object. l think it's an excellent idea. l wonder what l could give you.
Would you settle for one of my spells?
Bet that's not worth much.
Come with me.
- l like you better as a rabbit.
- Shut up, you.
Well, l never had a rabbit.
Careful what you touch in here.
Rum sort of place, ain't it?
When l signed for my witchcraft course there was a free bonus, a marvellous travelling spell if you paid in advance. l think l'll give you that one.
- ls it valuable?
- Certainly.
Poisoned dragon's liver?
You mean you poison the dragon or just the liver? lt comes prepared. lt's part of the school equipment.
Here we are. The travelling spell.
Everybody gather round.
All right now. Let's see.
Does any one of you have a bracelet or a ring?
- Something that you can twist.
- No, Miss Price.
- What about you, Paul?
- Always carry a few things around.
Never know when they might come in useful. Piece of blue glass.
Lovely bit of string.
Horseshoe nail.
What's that?
Knob from the bed upstairs.
- lt twists, don't it?
- Yeah. Twisted right off.
Yes, l think that will be all right.
Carrie, turn the light down a little bit, will you?
Hellebore, henbane, aconite... glow-worm fire, firefly light!
There. lsn't that pretty? ls that all we get?
This knob will now work the famous travelling spell.
And what's the famous travelling spell?
- How does it work?
- You take this knob and put it back on the bed upstairs.
Then turn it smartly a quarter turn to the left then in a firm, clear voice, tell it where you want to go and the bed will take you there.
Go on!
- Will it really?
- l see no reason to think otherwise.
Thank you for the lovely gift.
Sorry, but it belongs to Paul. He's the only one who can work the spell.
- Me?
- Yes.
That's right. My knob, weren't it?
That's the way the spell works.
Nice mess he'll make of things.
Oh, bother.
You children run upstairs.
Don't try anything with the bedknob till l get back.
''Dear Madam, it grieves me to inform you that we have been forced to close down our College of Witchcraft.''
''This means that we shall not be sending you the final lesson in which you expressed so much interest.''
- What's keeping you?
- l've had some very bad news. ls there anything we can do?
No. No, thank you.
Yes.
Yes, there is something that Paul can do.
- Me?
- l need the bedknob back.
- l must get to London.
- No. l want to go to the jungle.
Come with me, Paul.
Now, Paul.
Ridiculous as it may seem to have to explain this to a six-year-old,
- l do need your help.
- Go ahead. l was expecting a very important spell in the mail from my teacher, Professor Emelius
Browne, and it hasn't come.
What's that got to do with my knob? l must go to London immediately and see Professor Browne.
With his help, we may be able to bring this war to a successful end.
That is why l need the knob.
What is your decision?
Thank you, Paul. l brought this for your hair. lt may be windy.
Thank you. lt's ever so nice.
Paul, have you been to the bathroom?
- Twice.
- Good.
Charles, put on something warmer.
The bed may travel quite fast. l'm not going. l'm staying right here.
But why?
All that rubbish about a travelling bed. lt won't work. That's why.
Carrie, help me to pull the bed out.
We don't want to scratch the wall when we take off.
How's a ruddy big bed like that gonna get out of this room with those little windows? l don't know. There's a great many things about magic that l don't know.
- We'll just have to find out.
- Lovely!
Just leave me out of it. l don't fancy making a fool of myself.
What's come over you lately, Charlie?
You're no fun any more.
Help me tidy up. We don't want to go to London with an unmade bed.
- How old is Charles?
- Eleven, going on twelve. l see. That's what my father used to call the age of not believing.
What's that supposed to be?
When you rush around
in hopeless circles
Searching everywhere
for something true
You're at the age of not believing
When all the make-believe
is through
That's Charlie to a tee.
When you set aside
your childhood heroes
And your dreams are lost
upon a shelf
You're at the age of not believing
And worst of all you doubt yourself
Throw that away.
You're a castaway
where no one hears you
On a barren isle in a lonely sea
What's that? Poetry?
Where did all the happy endings go?
Where can all the good times be?
Everyone on the bed who's going.
You must face the age
of not believing
Doubting everything you ever knew
The knob.
Until at last you start believing
There's something wonderful in you
Lovely sentiment, l'm sure.
- Are you ready, Paul?
- Yes, Miss Price.
Repeat after me.
Take us to
Professor Emelius Browne...
Very good.
Headmaster, Correspondence
College of Witchcraft.
..of Witchcraft, London.
When l say go, tap the knob three times and turn it a quarter turn to the left.
- Left...
- That's it.
We'd better hold on tight.
The behaviour of the bed is something l'm not sure of.
Let me breathe a little.
All right, Paul. Ready? Go.
One... two... three...
- ls this London?
- Course it is!
- Smell that lovely sooty air.
- Marvellous, ain't it?
- Charles, are you convinced?
- Not yet l ain't. l don't see no Professor Browne.
Neither do l.
You children look after the bed while l make enquiries for Mr Browne.
- l told you this bed wouldn't work.
- Don't start that again. lt didn't work. lt was supposed to take us to Professor Browne.
- ''Professor Browne.''
- Come on!
Ladies and gentlemen, gather round, please.
Please note the name:
Professor Emelius Browne. l am here to divert, to amuse, and, yes, even to help you.
- There he is!
- lt is not what things are... lt is what they seem to be. ls that not so?
That ain't the kind of professor l expected. l'm not sure it's the kind
Miss Price expected, either.
What effect a little smoke is... with a dash of hocus-pocus and the scent of burning... and the scent of burning sulphur in the air.
And now, for my next trick, may l draw your attention to this solid piece of ordinary window glass, framed in an ordinary unprepared frame.
May l also draw your attention to this perfectly ordinary steel nail.
Now l shall place the framed glass in this brown, unprepared...
Unprepared, mark you...
Unprepared brown paper bag. l shall now attempt to drive the steel nail through the glass without breaking the glass.
''lmpossible!'' l hear you say.
We shall see.
He ain't very good, even if he is a professor. l tell you what l'm going to do.
No, please don't go.
Don't leave now and regret lost opportunities later.
You, young sir. Would you care to warble like the storied nightingale?
With this inexpensive device, you can charm the very birds down from the trees, like so.
- How much?
- For you, sir, one penny.
One copper coin of the realm.
Carrie, l'm very surprised at you wandering off like this.
We found him for you, miss.
We found Professor Browne.
Don't work. l've been cheated! ls that Professor Browne? lt is indeed, my dear.
How may l serve you?
Would you be interested in the mating call of the Brazilian bird of love?
Very useful, eh?
You are the headmaster of the
Emelius Browne College of Witchcraft?
The late headmaster.
The college, alas, is now defunct.
Professor Browne, l am one of your pupils.
My dear lady, you are indeed an ornament to the college.
- Splendid.
- Not at all. l was shocked when you closed down the college without that most important last lesson. l'm sorry, my dear. No refunds.
Look at your contract.
But l must have the spell that comes with the last lesson!
The matter is closed. l bid you good day. l have an appointment at my club.
The matter is not closed!
- Don't let him get away.
- Righto!
Here we are.
Will you get this child off my leg?
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Now l trust you'll behave more like a gentleman.
Look out!
There goes another rabbit.
What was all that about? l changed you into a rabbit with one of your own spells.
My spell? From my school?
Not one of your best spells. lt doesn't last.
Some of your others are much better.
But l don't understand. My spell?
They were just nonsense words from an old book.
They worked perfectly well for me.
They work for you?
Good woman! Some kind of destiny has brought us together.
You got these spells out of some old book, you say? l changed them round a bit. l gave them a bit of my own style, as it were.
The old sorcerers did have a bit of a tendency to waffle on.
But dear lady, l never thought l'd meet somebody like you.
What a treasure.
Mr Browne, will you please stick to the point. l would like to see this book immediately.
Certainly. lt's at my new town house.
Would you care to join me for luncheon?
We can discuss my ideas at the same time.
Thank you. We'd be delighted.
We shall all go together.
- On the bed?
- On the bed, Paul. Come along.
You go round the other side. l always travel on the left.
Will you give the address to Paul, please?
May l ask how we are going to get there on this bed? Fly?
My dear Professor, with your own travelling spell.
The one you gave with the course as a bonus.
My travelling spell?
That works as well?
Just give the address, please.
8 Winchfield Road.
Bed, take us to 8 Winchfield Road.
Madam, is this vehicle safe?
Perfectly. A bit theatrical, perhaps, but then most good spells are.
We're here. l would never have believed it.
You must have given us the wrong address. Do you live here? ln fact, l do.
Temporarily, at any rate. l found the front door open.
The house was deserted.
Everyone has left the neighbourhood.
Why should they do that?
This probably has something to do with it.
Merciful heavens!
You should be terrified at the very idea of living here.
You would have thought so. l am by nature a little bit of a coward.
But then l pondered. ln the perverse nature of things, this diabolical object is probably the best friend l've ever had. lt enables me, for the first time in my life, to live like a king.
Shall we go in?
Rothschild '26. Noble, worldly-wise, but with a charming touch of innocence.
Mr Browne, the book. Where is it?
Dear lady, you are relentless.
The book is in the library. We shall proceed there after our cheese and wine.
Why do you keep the curtains closed?
So that we may enjoy the gentle glow of candle light.
More likely so's a copper don't peek in and catch you hiding out here.
Why don't you have a look round the house?
- l want to chat with Miss Price.
- May we?
Yes, run along.
But don't touch anything.
Remember, this house does not belong to Mr Browne.
Mr Browne, where is that book? l must have that spell on substitutiary locomotion.
- What is it? A toy shop?
- No, it's a nursery.
- Ain't you ever seen a nursery?
- No. And neither have you.
Would you hold this, please?
What do you think of that?
- Well, l... don't know what to think.
- Miss Price.
Think how successful l could be with an assistant who can really do magic.
Dear lady, have you ever considered entering show business?
- The what business?
- The theatre!
Pantomimes, village fairs, the seaside.
Brighton, Blackpool, follies on the prom. l have very important work to do.
Listen to me. We could make a packet.
Let us strike a bargain
You possess a gift
But I can speak the jargon
That will give your gift
the needed lift
You possess the know-how
And I command the show-how
Oh, how successful you could be
With me l'm afraid we're wasting valuable time.
- What's your name?
- Miss Price.
- Your first name.
- Eglantine.
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh, how you'll shine
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours
As the shine sells the boot
and the blossoms the fruit
All you need to succeed
in your plan
Is the proper ally
upon whom to rely
And I'm your man
For I have an acumen
that's nigh-superhuman
I sell things that nobody can
So I humbly suggest
you accept my behest
I'm your man
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh how you'll shine
Will you stop?
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours
What are you reading?
''lsle of Naboombu.''
- Can't be no such place.
- There is too such a place.
These pictures prove it, don't it?
Bit weird, ain't it?
Animals wearing hats and things. l like it.
Now where is the book?
Well? Where is it?
At last, Mr Browne!
''The Spells of Astoroth.''
Of course.
Here's the travelling spell.
This is where you got it.
Does one's nose have to twitch like this?
Oh, you're back, Mr Browne.
Miss Price, a word about your tactics. l don't mind being changed into a hawk or a tiger or something with dash.
But always a fluffy white rabbit? lt's intolerable!
Here we are!
Substitutiary locomotion.
''The ancient art of...''
''The spell which creates this force is five mystic words.''
''These words are...''
But the rest of the book is missing!
Now you see why l closed down the college.
- But where are the other pages?
- Haven't the foggiest.
- Listen to me!
- l'm all ears.
You will be if you don't pay attention.
Where did you get this book? l bought it from a street market.
There was a bit of unpleasantness.
He claimed that l'd given him a dud coin. l ask you!
There was a sort of scuffle.
The book tore.
He got one half and l got the other.
- But where's the other half now?
- lt's probably been thrown away.
But if it still exists, there's only one place to find it.
- Where is that?
- Portobello Road
Portobello Road
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed
Anything and everything
a chap can unload
Is sold off the barrow
in Portobello Road
You'll find what you want
in the Portobello Road
- Rare alabaster
- Genuine plaster
A filigreed samovar
owned by the tsars
- A pen used by Shelley
- A new Botticelli!
The snippers that clipped
old King Edward's cigars
Made in Hong Kong?
Two bob a dozen, would you say?
- Waterford crystal
- Napoleon's pistols
Society heirlooms with genuine gems
Rembrandts, El Grecos,
Toulouse-Lautrecos
Painted last week
on the banks of the Thames
Very interesting, but where do they sell books?
There's a little place around the corner.
Portobello Road, Portobello Road
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed
Anything and everything

You meet all your chums
in the Portobello Road
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.
What l want is the other half of this book.
All in good time, my dear.
Burke's Peerage, The Bride Book,
The Fishmonger's Guidebook l'm looking for the other part of this.
A Victorian novel, ''The Unwanted Son''

Tokens and treasures,

Cheap imitations
and heirlooms of old
Dented and tarnished,
scarred and unvarnished
In old Portobello...
This lady is looking for the other half of this book. lt's called ''The Spells of Astoroth''. l don't keep no torn or damaged books here.
What do you think l am?
A ruddy wastepaper merchant?
You can eat like a king
in the Portobello Road
There's another bookstore along here somewhere.
You don't expect to sell a piano like that, do you?
Let me have a go, my dear fellow.
Portobello Road, Portobello Road
Happy things are happening
in Portobello Road
You feel like a ballerina
when you're hopping like a toad
When you kick your heels up
down in Portobello Road
Come on, ducks!
Come on, girls!
Lovely.
Oh, yeah, play the drums.
Closing time!
Bye!
Portobello Road

Anything and everything

Hey, governor. Something for the lady friend? Nylons?
- No, thank you.
- Petrol coupons?
- Chocs for the little 'uns?
- No.
How about one of these, mate?
Fell off the back of a lorry.
- Be a good chap and run away.
- Would you fancy this, then?
Now you have my undivided attention.
- What can l do for you?
- Get over to the Bookman right away.
He wants to see you. You too.
Who is the Bookman? And what right has he got to order me about? l think we'd better ask questions later.
Excuse me.
Sorry, guv.
No one told me about the stairs.
Why didn't you bring Scotland Yard, Swinburne, and half the Household Cavalry as well?
What's the bed for? lt's a present for you.
That's what he said.
Nothing of the sort.
The bed belongs to me.
Except for this knob, which is mine.
Bookman, there's been bad blood between us long enough.
Let this gift begin friendship anew.
- Draw the curtains. Lock the door.
- You'll be snug as a bug. lsn't that the section of the manuscript we've been looking for?
- Who is this person?
- Miss Eglantine Price.
A charming young woman of my acquaintance.
Miss Price, l've been looking for this other bit a long time.
Mr Swinburne told me you were in the market making enquiries.
And here we are. l don't mind saying, to see it all together at last...
- There isn't much l wouldn't do.
- Or haven't done, for that matter.
- Right, guv?
- You'll close your mouth, Swinburne. ls that clear? lt's all like a jolly detective story or jigsaw puzzle, isn't it?
We're both after the same spell.
You have one clue, l have the other.
Yes, in that case, the sensible thing seems to be for us to cooperate. l assume you're looking for the same thing l am.
May l?
This is quite a moment for both of us.
''Substitutiary locomotion, the lost miracle of the ancients.''
And so on and so forth.
Here we are.
''The spell which creates this force is five mystic words.''
''These words are... engraved on the star that was always worn by the sorcerer Astoroth.''
But where are the words of the spell? l assumed they'd be in your half of the manuscript. l thought they'd be in yours!
Once again, a dead end. l shall never know the secret. lsn't that old Astoroth?
And there's his star.
Pity it's so small you can't read the writing.
- But why the animals?
- Towards the end of his life,
Astoroth kept animals in cages in search for the spells that would make them more like humans.
The legend is that finally the animals rebelled at the experiment, killed Astoroth and stole many of his powers. lncluding the star with the spell on it.
Possibly.
They found a ship, sailed away and were never heard of again.
However, there is a final notation in my half of the book saying that in the 1 7th century a shipwrecked lascar was taken from the sea half mad with thirst and exposure to the sun.
Before he died, he swore he had seen an island ruled by animals.
Where?
There is, l regret to say, no such island. l looked for it in every chart.
The lsle of Naboombu does not exist. lt does too! Got my own...
- What is he trying to say?
- Nothing!
When he don't say nothing, he mumbles. l wish the child to speak!
- Now you've done it.
- There is too such a place.
Got my own book. There.
Real pretty letters, ain't it?
- Let me see it.
- You're not interested, Bookman.
- lt's just a children's book.
- l'll be the judge of that.
- Give it to me.
- No.
Please don't annoy me.
- Give me the book, boy.
- Not likely.
Bit of a stalemate, isn't it? lf it's all the same to you, l'd rather use my own.
Sentiment, you know.
Come along, Paul. lt's time to go.
Go? How, my dear? The door is locked.
Observe the fundamental weakness of the criminal mind.
- You will believe no one or anything.
- l understand.
- The knob, Paul.
- Course you do, my dear.
We can tell them the complete truth.
They will believe nothing.
He's up to something, you know.
Before your very eyes, l shall cause this bed and the occupants on it to disappear. l should like to see a cheap-jack tenth-rate entertainer do a trick like that.
''Cheap-jack entertainer.''
- That was naughty.
- All right, Paul.
- Where to?
- To the lsland of Naboombu.
- l'm very curious about that place.
- Good.
Bed, take us to the lsland of Naboombu.
Enough of this nonsense!
Get the book!
Beastly climate. l never did fancy the sea.
- Where are we?
- Naboombu, of course. l've never seen no island like this before. l'm afraid we may have fallen into the lagoon.
That's right.
Here we are on page three.
Oi, Mr Codfish!
Hello, young fellow!
Welcome to Naboombu Lagoon.
Now l'm hearing things.
Fish don't talk.
Not too bright, is he?
- He's my brother.
- Oh? Sorry.
Mr Codfish, where is the lsland of Naboombu?
You mean the land part? Oh, that.
Straight up. You can't miss it.
None of my business, of course, but l shouldn't go there if l were you.
- Having troubles, they are.
- Troubles?
He's right, you know.
A lot of trouble.
Trouble or not, we should be getting along.
- l wish to see who is in charge.
- What's the rush? lt's really rather splendid down here. For you, my dear.
Thank you.
How pleasant...
Bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What a chance to get a better peep
At the plants and creatures
of the deep
We glide
Far below the rolling tide
Serene
Through the bubbly blue and green
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What if the octopus,
the flounder and the cod
Think we're rather odd?
It's fun to promenade
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
Look!
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What a chance to get a better peep
At the plants
and creatures of the deep
It's grand
When you're dancing on the sand
Each glance
Bubbles over with romance
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along through the water
Where we get along swimmingly
Far from the frenzy
of the frantic world above
- Two beneath the blue
- Could even fall in love
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom of the beautiful briny,
shimmery shiny
Beautiful briny sea
Bravo!
Most exciting, most exciting.
You've won the ruddy cup.
Help!
This time l really caught a whopper!
People! Oh, no!
What scurvy luck.
- My goodness!
- l'll deal with this, my dear.
- Don't you know that...
- Good day, captain. l used to be a bit of a seafaring man myself.
Many's the time l've shipped out of Portsmouth.
Delighted to meet a fellow mariner.
Now stow it, mate.
- Oh, really!
- Can't you read reading? lt says... ''No peopling allowed.''
- Ridiculous!
- Don't antagonise him, Mr Browne.
That means l've got to throw you all back. That's what to do.
Wait it minute! lt says here that anybody can see the king.
- And that's the law.
- Where do it say that?
Here in my book.
So it do.
But if you people knew what was good for you, you'd get yourselves all throwed back.
The king don't like people!
Nonetheless, we must see the king on an urgent personal matter.
Please lead the way.
But just don't say l didn't warn you. See?
Follow me.
Get out of here!
Yes. What can l do for you? l caught some people down at the sea lagoon.
They want to see the king.
Really? Well, we can't be bothered with that sort of thing now, can we? l don't know that l fancy this.
His Majesty is in a frightful rage.
Excuse me, sir.
As an all-round entertainer, l am considered not without talent.
Perhaps l can cheer him up.
No, no. You don't understand.
As everyone knows,
His Majesty is the world's greatest soccer player.
But due to a technical problem, the Royal Cup match cannot take place today.
And His Majesty had so set his heart on it!
Throw these... creatures back into the sea.
Aye, aye, sir.
Just a moment! l can help!
Do you really think so? l'd be most grateful.
Do you know soccer?
Do l know anything about soccer?
Why, l was captain of Tottenham
Hotspurs for two years.
Three seasons with Manchester United...
Yes, yes. You'll do.
Come this way, please.
Mr Browne, are you certain you'll be all right?
Now what?
Not an ideal person in many respects, but Mr Browne is a very brave man.
Do you think he's done for?
Do you think so? l can't tell you how l appreciate this.
For some reason we have great difficulty finding referees round here. lf there be one thing we like, it's volunteers, eh, Birdy?
He's a proper king!
Look at his crown!
What's he got round his neck?
What a magnificent... ornament, sire.
Ah, yes.
Wouldn't be without it.
Been in the family for years.
The Star of Astoroth!
You're to sit in His Majesty's royal box.
No littering, no chewing, no fruit or wrappers or sweets. Please.
Rise, please.
Loyal fans, this is official.
We have a volunteer referee.
Let the match begin!
He's still wearing it!
Right, Dirty Yellows, let's have a clean game.
Right, True Blues, best foot forward.
Weird sort of game they play here.
Hurry up! Get rid of it!
Gracious!
You're doing fine, matey.
Move it around.
Get on with the match!
- Foul!
- They're only animals.
That's no excuse for dirty football.
Ref, are you blind?
Be quiet, Charles!
Don't forget who the referee is!
- Don't they have no rules?
- Course they do.
The king makes them up as he goes along.
Poor Mr Browne.
Do you think he's all right?
Well, he's moving.
Steady, matey. Move it around.
He almost had it then.
Looks like he's done for this time.
Don't just stand there! Head it in!
Stop... that... ball!
Goal!
Game's over. l win.
Let me give you a hand, matey.
That's quite all right, Your Majesty.
Thank you so much.
Please, let me help you on with your robe.
Why, yes. Thank you.
Can't have you catching cold, sire, can we?
Why, no.
Have you ever heard of something called the gypsy switch?
No, can't say that l have.
Remind me to tell you about it some time. l can't tell you when we've had such a good time.
We'll carry your memory in our hearts for a long while. l think it's time to leave.
Must you go?
Must be dashing. Marvellous game.
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.
Friendly lot.
Don't mind them visiting.
Wouldn't want them living here.
- Come along, children.
- Hurry up.
Stop gibbering!
What's the matter with you?
Your Royal Star!
They've stolen your Royal Star!
Don't be ridiculous.
What do you think this is?
Why didn't you say so?
Paul, put the knob on the bed.
At last the magic words.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee. l'll keep it.
Women always lose things.
- Hurry, Paul! The knob!
- lt's stuck!
- l suppose l'd better do something.
- Please do. Quick.
Got it.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree...
Oh, bother. l do hate shoddy work. l shall never get used to this thing.
Will you push the bed back into place, please? l think we could all do with a nice cup of tea.
No time. l've gone to a lot of trouble to find this spell. l'm going to try it immediately.
Mr Browne, kindly let me have your shoes, please.
- Fine.
- What's the shoes for? lf you'd been paying attention l should think you'd be aware that substitutiary locomotion is the art of causing inanimate objects to take on a life force of their own. l must have inanimate objects to experiment with.
Makes sense, don't it?
Stand back, everyone. l need plenty of room. l want you all to be absolutely quiet.
Mr Browne, you have the Star of Astoroth, l believe.
Oh, yes. lt's in my nice clean hanky. lt's all right, Mr Browne. l should have realised that it would be impossible to take an object from one world into another. lf only l would have had the sense to remember the words on that star.
- l know the words.
- Don't bother her. She's thinking.
Why don't you and l nip out and get something for supper?
And l might conceivably call into the pub for a pint to steady my nerves. l do know the words, Miss Price.
How can you know the words when Miss Price doesn't?
Troop movements and massing
of barges in French and Dutch ports.
The prime minister
has told the nation
to be on the alert for signs
of a possible invasion.
That was the news. l might have been able to do something about this. lt's out of your hands now, my dear. lf only l could have remembered those words. lt's maddening.
Why don't someone ask me?
Come off it, Paul. You can't remember those kind of words.
You mean like ''Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee''?
- How do you know that?
- Easy.
Says so right here in my book.
You mean it was there in your book all the time?
Yeah. But nobody ever listens to me.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
Nothing happened!
Am l doing something wrong?
Well, it does seem a bit old-fashioned.
After all, we are in the 20th century.
- What do you suggest?
- lt needs rhythm. Tempo.
Music.
As l always say, do it with a flair.
- Do you mind if l have a go?
- Of course not.
Come along, you lot!
We need all the help we can get.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
Substitutiary locomotion
Mystic power that's far
beyond the wildest notion
It's so weird, so feared,
yet wonderful to see
Substitutiary locomotion come to me
Now!
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
I don't want locomotiary substitution
Or remote intransecory convolution
Only one precise solution is the key
Substitutiary locomotion it must be
Substitutiary locomotion
Lovely substitutiary locomotion
You've made substitutiary history
With treguna mekoides
and a little help from me
- With treguna mekoides and...
- Trecorum satis dee
Mr Browne, what is going on here? l haven't the foggiest.
How do you do?
Shall we?
- That's my nightgown!
- ls it really, my dear? l'm not responsible for its behaviour.
Obviously not, my dear.
Paul, what on earth are you doing?
Having a jolly good time, that's what.
- How can we stop all this?
- Must we? lt's most agreeable.
But we must do something.
Didn't l give you my all-purpose cut-off spell?
- Lesson number eight.
- Eight.
- Yes, number eight l think it was.
- Oi! My Sunday trousers!
Buzz off, old chap.
Find your own dancing partner.
Be careful, Carrie! Slow down!
Mr Browne, will you please control your shoes?
Dear lady, l very much fear that we have nothing under control.
Do you mind?
Now, who would like some more of my lovely sausages and mash?
- No more for me, thank you.
- Carrie? l've already had two helpings.
- l'm full.
- Me, too.
At least somebody wants some.
Cheer up, my dear. This should be something of a celebration. l'm sorry, but there doesn't seem to be much to celebrate.
- l still haven't mastered that spell.
- Of course you have.
You just need a little more practice.
- Do you really think so?
- No doubt about it.
Meantime, there's nothing to liven the spirits like a little master juggling.
Right, Charlie?
Go on then, guv!
Give us some juggling!
Very few better than me at this.
All you need is 20 years' practice and a touch of genius.
Never happened to me before. l don't usually juggle with cats under my feet.
Look! She's laughing!
- Mrs Hobday. Do come in.
- l can't stop, my dear. l've just come by to bring you the good news.
Mr Bistlethwaite, who brings the milk, you know?
He's promised to take the children in!
He and his wife have got that farm.
Just the place for growing children.
Put a bit of colour back in their cheeks.
Why, what's the matter? l thought you'd be pleased.
You told me yourself that you had no time to take care of children.
Circumstances have changed somewhat.
We got a dad now. Mr Browne.
- Paul!
- Miss Price, is this true?
Of course. You do want him to stay with us, don't you, Miss Price? l suppose l hadn't really thought about it.
What about him?
What do you say about it, Mr Browne? lt's all rather sudden! l don't quite know what to say.
Then l'll leave you two to talk it over. l'll come back in the morning!
Good night! lt is true, Mr Browne. You are going to be our father now, aren't you?
We are rather rushing things, aren't we?
Perhaps Mr Browne has other things besides you children to think about.
Yes. As a matter of fact l should have left ages ago. l must get a train back to London tonight. lt's rather an important matter. l'd like to tell you about it, but it's a little bit hush-hush.
Sort of a secret.
Well... if... lf l've been any sort of help to you, l'm pleased.
You've been immensely kind.
Thank you. l've enjoyed being with you.
Perhaps it's been good for all of us.
Will you be coming back?
Some day, my dear. l certainly hope that we shall meet again.
Some day.
When all this war business is over.
- l see.
- Perhaps l shall realise my dream.
Eglantine and Emelius: illusionists extraordinary!
Just think how that will look on the poster.
The children are going to miss you.
- You really think they will?
- Yes.
Well, l shall miss you. All of you. lf l don't go now you might never get rid of me.
Goodbye, Carrie.
- Must you really go?
- l think it's best for everybody.
- Goodbye, Paul.
- l think you should be our father.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Do you want me to come down to the station with you?
No, no. You stay here and look after everybody.
- Goodbye, Miss Price.
- Goodbye, Mr Browne.
- When is the next train to London?
- Lord bless ye, ain't no train.
Not until milk job,
4 a.m. tomorrow morning.
- Mind if l await it here?
- Suit yourself. Good night, sir.
Good night.
Out you go, Cosmic.
Hello?
Emelius Browne, do you know
you could be warm and cosy
in that house at this very moment?
For once in your useless life,
you really seem to have been needed.
You're a failure, Emelius Browne,
and a coward.
No, Fräulein, this is not the invasion, just a little exercise.
A minor raid to induce panic and to spread a little mischief.
When you English get it through your head that the German forces can land whenever and wherever we please, perhaps you will consider reasonable peace.
Not bloody likely!
Go on, Miss Price. Do it to him. l must say, it's very tempting.
Colonel, how would you feel about being turned into a white rabbit? l said, how would you feel about being turned into a white rabbit?
Be quiet, please.
Filigree, apogee, epogee...
- Not again!
- Your memory, Miss Price.
Would you kindly fetch my notebook from the workroom?
Righto.
Silence!
We have work to do. l am sorry, but l must send all of you some place where you will no longer be a nuisance.
As the words sell the tune
And the moonbeams the moon
All I need to succeed in my plan
Is a champion rare
with a flourish and a flair
Eglantine!
Where's the spell for rabbits?
The easiest of all, she said.
Confound it, can't women ever learn to file things properly?
Here it is.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
That's it.
Filigree... apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Come along. For once in your life, you've got to believe in something.
That's it. Good lad.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
What's the use of putting us in that draughty castle? lt's quite chilly.
The colonel believes when a British female decides to become a nuisance, she can become the greatest nuisance in the world, and l'm inclined to agree with him.
You need a lesson in manners. lf l had my notebook, l'd make certain you'd learn a few.
Jumping Jehosophat! More Jerries!
Take it easy, can't you?
- Try holding your breath.
- l am holding it.
We could strip him down and grease him with soap.
No, it's no good. We can't do it. l could have told you that in the first place. lf we can't get Paul out we'll just have to think of something else.
What about that spell that makes things move about?
- But l'd need weapons.
- How about all these things? l'm afraid they're a bit ancient.
- Where did this come from?
- lt's Mr Browne!
He's on his way to London.
Mr Browne? lf you are Mr Browne, would you get off my lap? lt is Mr Browne! lt is you!
You didn't think that l could do that spell, did you? l am glad to see you!
But what about all these Germans?
What's wrong with the substitutiary locomotion spell?
- That ought to be useful.
- lt isn't ready yet.
- You saw what happened.
- We have to chance it.
We can't let these so-and-sos get away with their beastly little raid.
Won't you get up off the floor?
We'll go to work.
- Jolly good luck, my dear.
- Thank you.
Let's hope you haven't forgotten the spell.
- Not this time.
- Found this in the castle.
Probably not magic, but it might make you feel more at home.
Thank you.
That was very thoughtful of you.
Let's get out of Miss Price's way.
Treguna... mekoides... trecorum... satis dee.
Look!
Sound the advance!
Just in time for the kick-off.
Steady on the left.
Victory for England and St George!
Like a Lord Mayor's show!
Pikemen, hold your distance.
Treguna mekoides
and trecorum satis dee
Blimey!
- Where's it coming from?
- Sounds like the sea road, sir.
Come on, lads! After me.
Good shooting, bowmen!
Well caught, sir. Very good.
Knock his block off! That's it!
Mr Browne, make those children take cover!
Are you still there, Colonel? l thought you'd be on your way by now.
You see? Things may not be so easy for you after all.
Goodbye, Colonel!
Eglantine.
Dear Mr Browne.
- We thought they'd damaged you.
- See? No one can hurt Miss Price.
There they are, lads! l said something was afoot!
All right. Drive them into the sea.
Firing positions. Both sides.
All right, men. Hold your fire. l think we've taught the Hun a lesson.
He'll think twice before coming back here again. lt's tragic. All your spells, your equipment. All gone.
Still, l was able to perform some small service first.
That mean you ain't gonna be a witch no more? Never?
No, Paul. l realised some time ago that l could never be a proper witch.
Was it that first magic moment when you laid eyes on me?
No. lt was the day my poisoned dragon's liver arrived. l knew that anyone who felt the way l did about poisoned dragon's liver had no business being a witch.
- Certain you're doing the right thing?
- Well, l think so. lt's much too dangerous being a civilian.
Take care of yourself, guv. l'll do that. And l'll be back before you've grown an inch taller.
- We'll be together again.
- Sounds like you have an escort.
Well, here we go.
- Permission to move off, sir.
- Carry on, sergeant.
Parade, by the right, quick march!
Suppose that's it.
We ain't gonna have no fun no more.
Still got this, ain't l?

ELVIS: My daddy had seen a lot of people who played guitar and stuff...
...who didn't work.
So he said,
"You should make up your mind...
...about either being an electrician or playing guitar."
He said, "I never saw a guitar player that was worth a damn."
[MAN LAUGHING]
MAN: One player got so mad after a game, he went in the dressing room...
...threw his glove down to the ?oor and missed.
[CROWD LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING]
Now, this is a favorite city of mine...
...and many people have asked me questions about our tour.
Our tour is 15 days.
We started in Buffalo through Richmond and now we're here in San Antone.
We've eaten everything from Yankee pot roast to grits.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
And we have been in 15 cities in 15 nights.
Elvis has been in 15 different cities in 15 nights...
...and he's not running for president.
[CROWD LAUGHING]
But he would've won every primary,
I tell you that.
[CROWD CHEERING AND WHISTLING]
Now, many people ask why does he have me on this show.
I'm on the show because he needed a sex symbol.

For the Medicare group.

[KAHANE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
How's the stage?

ELVIS: Whew.
It's for our film.
- We came over too soon, didn't we?

ELVIS: I've never gotten over what they call stage fright.
I go through it every show.
It's always so wild.
ELVIS:
I'm pretty concerned.
I'm pretty much thinking about the show.
I never get completely comfortable with it.
I don't let the people with me get comfortable with it...
...in that I remind them that it's a new crowd out there, it's a new audience.
And they haven't seen us before, so it's gotta be like the first time we go on.
If Hal comes up and I don't see him, tell him to come back again.
- Okay, fine, sure. Yeah, all right.
- Okay.
- You know about the stage and all that?
- Yeah.
Nothing I can do about that.
ELVIS:
I don't like to stay backstage too long.
I got to please the crowd.
I mean, I got to excite them, you know, make them happy.
And gear myself to doing that show.
And somebody could walk up to me and say:
"Hey, your head just exploded."
I wouldn't hear it.

- Hello.
- Hello.
Do you realize this Nigerian coffee is being packed straight back to Nigeria?
Frightening, isn't it?
- Been here long?
- Mr. Travis?
- Long enough.
- Mr. Travis!
- Oh, see you.
- Yeah.
This Hessler is our latest machine.
It gives a four-sided seal and runs 72 packs a minute.
Any fault in the plastic packing can cause a break.
The coffee is returned to our patent coffee processor.
Now, why is that? Mr. Biles?
- I've been off sick, sir.
- Eliminates waste, sir.
Absolutely correct.
Always remember, gentlemen, that you are a failure in catering...
...if you don't know what to do with your leftovers.
Right, I'll take them off your hands now, Mr. Stone.
Follow me, gentlemen.
Now, gentlemen...
...you have learned the number one truth.
That a cup of Imperial Coffee is the only proper way to finish a meal.
Be it in a palace or a prison.
But between the making and the drinking must stand the salesman.
This is where you come in.
You will be our representatives in the frontline.
Each one of you is going to have to prove himself on the battlefield of sales.
It's a hard road you'll have to travel.
There will be whole days when you won't sell a bean...
...but you will go out the very next day and hit the jackpot.
Mr. Duff, may I ask a question?
- Certainly, Mr. Travers.
- Travis.
Beg your pardon.
How much does a top salesman get paid?
Your basic salary will be low, of course,
11.50 pounds per week, before tax.
But for a good man, with commission, the sky is the limit.
Our star salesman at the moment...
...a wonderful man called Jim Oswald...
...takes home anything from 75 pounds...
...to 150 pounds a week.
Now, I have never lied to you...
...never given you false hopes...
...but I believe in you.
With a coffee pack in one hand and your sales list in the other...
...I want you to be one long line...
...of shining success.
From John O'Groat's to Land's End.
Now, selling is psychology.
A good salesman must know something about psychology.
And in that particular field,
I can think of no better authority...
...than our chief of public relations,
Mrs. Gloria Rowe.
Mr. Spalding, please.
Come here, Mr. Spalding.
Smile.
Smile, Mr. Spalding.
Imperial product is good.
But people don't buy things just because they're good.
They have to believe.
And you have to inspire that belief.
You have to believe.
Remember the words of William Blake.
"A sincere belief that anything is so, will make it so."
Sincerity. Honesty.
Mr. MacIntyre, Mr. Travis,
Mr. Greasy.
- Thank you, Mr. Spalding.
- Thank you.
Hello, Mr. MacIntyre.
Smile.
Give with all your heart.
Don't think of yourself.
Relax those cheek muscles.
Smile, Mr. MacIntyre.
Mr. Travis.
Morning, Mrs. Rowe.
Now, that is sincerity.
That is a completely sincere smile.
If I was a buyer and these were two travellers...
...I'd definitely buy from the guy I like.
I'd definitely buy from the sincere personality.
I'm definitely going to buy from you,
Mr. Travis.
Lecture hall here. Duff speaking.
Now, Mr. Travis,
I want you to smile at Mr. Greasy.
Mr. Greasy, smile back and give Mr. Travis a firm handshake.
Certainly. Right away, sir.
Mr. Greasy, don't think I'm being personal...
...but we're when dealing with food products, hygiene must be our motto.
Make sure you've got clean fingernails.
- Mrs. Rowe?
- Yes.
The chairman wants to see us immediately.
Take a break, gentlemen.
I'll see you on the shop floor in 20 minutes.
Gentlemen, I have very bad news.
Oswald has left the Northeast.
Left?
Vanished. Disappeared.
No notice. Nothing.
Just one ruddy great hole on the map.
And that's not all.
Oswald is suspected of trafficking in stolen goods under imperial's name.
- My God.
- Oh, God.
Well, I need an immediate replacement.
Mr. Duff, how are your trainees?
They're very good, sir.
But they need another two weeks.
No, no, I can't wait.
Mrs. Rowe.
Now, what's your instinct say?
Who's my man?
Can you sniff him?
Travis.
That's your man.
Travis, we're in a jam.
You heard about Oswald?
It's a case of all hands to the pumps.
I understand, sir.
Now, Mrs. Rowe has spoken highly of you...
...and I have never known her wrong...
...so I'm going to play her hunch.
I'm giving you the Northeast.
Now, that's as far north as the border...
...as far west as Lancashire...
...and as far south as the Humber.
It's a big challenge.
Do you think you're up to it?
I know I am, sir.
Normally, an opportunity like this wouldn't come your way for 10 or 20 years.
Men far more experienced than you have had their shot at it...
...and been broken by it.
But you've got guts...
...and you've got ambition...
...and that gives you a head start.
Good luck.
Now, there's your card.
Never travel without it.
Your map...
...your compass...
...and your car keys.
Now go out there and fight.
I will, sir. Every inch of the way.
You can rely on me.
Good man.
He's all yours now, Mrs. Rowe.
Oh, and Travis...
Thank you very much, sir.
Come here, Mr. Travis.
I am going to give you a simple test.
Be very careful how you answer.
I want you to taste these cups of coffee...
...and tell me what they do for you.
Sturdy...
...plebian...
...plenty of body.
A vigorous robusta?
Spicy.
Now this.
The future is in your hands, Mr. Travis.
Take it.
Now.

Don't bother.
No need to detain the gentleman.

~ Hold me close wherever we go ~
He's gone.
Now scarper.
But what about him?
Done for. Perforated kidneys.
It was his fault.
He was driving too fast.
Oh, we can see what happened.
We'll be witnesses.
Save you the trouble.
Oh, it's no trouble.
I can give you a statement.
As far as we're concerned, it's a private accident.
No one else involved.
Unless you give a statement.
Then our chief constable might find you're involved.
He might bring charges against you.
Using us as witnesses.
Our word against yours.
So on your way, chummy.
Unless you want booking for manslaughter.
There you are.
Fair dos.
Fair dos.
A report from our Belfast newsroom.
Two gunmen fired seven shots,
aimed it seems at the sentries on duty...
... in the grounds of the general's house
which is heavily guarded by soldiers...
... and security staff with dogs.
Soldiers fired back
and later found traces of blood...
... which lead them to believe
they hit one of the gunmen.
The Egyptian War Minister,
General Sadek, has resigned.
The move was seen as a reflection
of the dissension in Egypt...
... over the country's relationship
with the Soviet Union.
And tonight it's your line
on the subject of mental health.
It's estimated that one in six women,
and one in nine men...
... will enter a hospital at least once
in their lives because of mental illness.
What are the causes of the steady increase
in mental illness?
Can they be avoided?
Are we spending
enough care and money...
... on the mentally sick
and the mentally handicapped?
Are they better treated in hospital
or in their own homes and communities?
Mr. Travis?
Hello. Good evening.
- Come in.
- Thank you.
I was getting quite worried about you.
It can be a nasty drive over those moors.
Still, here you are safe and sound.
Bill!
Would you sign the book, please?
You've missed supper...
...but I'll do you something special.
Bill, would you show Mr. Travis to his room?
Thank you very much.
Oh, Mr. Travis...
...I'm afraid Mr. Oswald left quite a lot behind.
I put it in one of the drawers.
I didn't like to throw it out.
That's all right. I'll manage, thank you.
So you're the new rabbit?
You're the replacement, are you?
- Who are you?
- Oh, I live here.
Don't let me hold you up.
Would you like a cigarette?
Oh, sorry.
You look a bit young.
Well, you need a young man for a job like this.
Possibly.
Did you ever meet your predecessor?
- Oswald?
- Oswald.
No, I've only been with the firm five weeks.
That stuff's no good. I told him.
Why did he scarper?
Luck.
Opportunity.
He took off.
No stamina.
That's what you've gotta have in a job like this. Stamina.
You've got to have it. Providing, of course, you've got the technical know-how.
Nothing else you need?
Well, you've got to have ambition.
Mr. Travis?
Yes, Mrs. Ball.
I've got your supper ready.
It's in the parlour.
Thank you, Mrs. Ball. I'll be right down.

She doesn't come in anymore.
It's urgent.
There's nothing urgent around here.
They're closing us down.

- Paying us off.
Why?

Still, I take it the arrangements will be as were?
Yes, Mr. Johnson. Yes.
It's Mayor Johnson, to be precise.
I've still got three months in office.
Good. Well, I'll give you all the help I can.
Not only here, but in Leeds, Doncaster,
Wakefield and other cities...
...of major importance surrounding.
You can confirm with Faulkner that we'll be continuing our standing bulk order.
In fact, you'll find him around the back now.
You've just come at the right time.
We're having a bit of a party.
Do you like you know what?
- What, Mayor Johnson?
- A party.
Oh, yes.

Barlow, county constabulary.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Superintendent.
At your service. And this is Mavis.
Now, you be nice to Mr. Travis, Mavis.
- But not too nice.
- Happy to greet you.
- Great pleasure.
- Come here. Come here.
Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to the part of the show you've all been waiting for.
We have a first-class selection for you.
All your favourites...
...and one or two novelties.
And as usual, we will be starting with our request spot.
So if you'd like to signify your preference in the usual manner...
Isle of Capri.
- Whiplash.
- Aye, Whiplash.
- Whiplash. Whiplash.
- Roman Candles.
Roman Candles!
- Roman Candles. Another one?
- Chocolate Sandwich.
- Chocolate Sandwich.
- Yes, Chocolate Sandwich.
Chocolate Sandwich.
Chocolate Sandwich.
Chocolate Sandwich.
Chocolate Sandwich.
Chocolate Sandwich.
All right. All right.
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
You have it. You have it.
Ladies and gentlemen, by overwhelming demand...
...we start with everybody's favourite,
Chocolate Sandwich.
Come on, June, Violet, Eddie.
Come on, loves. Give them a big hand.
Travis. Imperial Coffee.
Becky. Mind if I borrow your knee?
Thank you.
Michael.
Mrs. Ball?
Mary.
Mr. Travis.
Wanted on the phone. Urgent.
Hello? Hello?
Gloria.
What? What's that?
Scotland as well?
I haven't any warm clothing.
Yes, but I'm doing well here.
Building up some fabulous contacts.
I don't wanna throw it away.
Yes, I see it's a challenge.
Tomorrow? But where?
Well, that's 200 miles away.
By 10 a.m.?
Who do I ask for?
Yeah. Who?
Who?
Hello?
Hello, Gloria? Hello?
Mr. Travis.
Did you hear that?
Do you think I ought to go?
I've got something for you.
Come on, try it on.
Arms up.
A perfect fit.
It's good.
It really is good.
You'll find it surprisingly warm.
I'll be back. I promise I will.
Try not to die like a dog.
The blessing.
Lord, on the way to goodness...
... when we stumble, hold us.
When we fall, lift us up.
When are hard-pressed by evil,
deliver us.
Soyuz 11 's braking system for re-entry into
the Earth's atmosphere was switched off.
A soft-landing engine
fired according to plan...
... and a smooth landing was made
in the arranged area.
Presumably somewhere in Kazakhstan.
A helicopter-born recovery crew...
... which landed simultaneously
with Soyuz 11...
... opened the hatch and found
the three cosmonauts dead.
Now, zazen. What does that mean?
Zazen is a way of sitting
cross-legged and with an erect back...
... practicing the art of Zen.
And Zen means?
To understand life, to be with life,
to get a feeling of life...
... so that in effect
all your days are good days...
... and every day should be looked upon
as living in the moment...
... rather than in the past or future.
And this is really what Zen is all about.
Living now.
Now, tell me how we come by
this illumination...
... this awareness that is at the heart
of the practice called zazen.
Is it very hard practice.
Nothing is acquired in a day.
And yet I understand that
this illumination does come suddenly.
It comes suddenly.
It comes in many ways.
One could be arranging
a vase of flowers...
I'm asking you not to give any trouble.
I want you on the ground before I count three.
One, two...
- I'm only trying to find out where I am.
- Don't kick or butt with your head...
...and you won't get hurt.
Okay, chaps, get him in.
Most places will have a cloudy day
and there will be rain and drizzle at times.
Now, Mr. Travis...
...you realize where you are?
You know where you are,
Mr. Travis?
Yes.
Your pass?
- What's in these packets?
- Coffee samples.
Hey, that happens to be company property.
I have to account for every single bean.
Otherwise, I'm in trouble.
You are in trouble.
Who are you working for?
- Gloria Rowe.
- Who else?
What do you mean, who else?
Who are you working for?
The Imperial Coffee Company.
Who do you know in this establishment?
I don't know anybody.
But who were you expecting to contact?
The catering manager, Mr. Woolley.
Has three children. Plays billiards.
Sign this, please.
Where the crosses are.
- What is it?
- Your confession.
I don't know what I've done.
I haven't done anything.
You'll find it easier if you sign.
I haven't done anything.
Bassett.
- Tea or coffee?
- Tea, please. Two sugars.
Coffee, black.
Thank you.
- Tea, Bassett?
- No, thank you, sir.
- Chocolate biscuit?
- Please.
That'll be three P for the biscuit.
- Would the young man like a cup of tea?
- Later.
There's no need to go through all this, you know?
You've only got to sign the paper.
But I'm innocent.
I haven't done anything.
There are three things you can be sure of:
The pain is not going to stop...
...you will remain conscious...
...and in the end, you will sign.
Bassett.
Now...
...let's start at the beginning.
When did you join the party?
Last year.
How much are they paying you?
- Three hundred a month.
- Three hundred what?
Pounds.
Rubles.
Was your headmaster correct to expel you from school?
Yes.
Do you believe children are the hope of the future?
Yes.
Do you believe in the fellowship of man?
- Yes.
- Think carefully.
No.
Do you rate loyalty above obedience?
Always leave everything in a mess.
I keep telling them.
recently began a project
to clear the local beach...
... a piece of woodland.
The whole school, with the help
of the Cleansing Department...
... of the local authority,
cleared five wagon-loads of rubbish.
Others planted 40 trees
with help of the Parks Department.
This is to be a manual affair.
This spring, we're building...
~ Not as orphans ~
~ Are we left in sorrow now ~
~ Hallelujah ~
~ He is near us ~
~ Faith believes nor questions how ~
~ Though the cloud ~
~ From sight received him ~
~ When the 40 days were o'er ~
~ Shall our hearts ~
~ Forget his promise ~
~ I am with you ~
~ Evermore ~
Let us pray.
Almighty and most merciful Father.
Almighty and most merciful Father.
We, thine unworthy servants.
We, thine unworthy servants.
Do give thee most humble and hearty thanks.
Do give thee most humble and hearty thanks.
For all thy goodness and loving kindness to us and to all men.
For all thy goodness and loving kindness to us and to all men.
We bless thee for our creation.
We bless thee for our creation.
No.
Not that.
That's God's food. That's for God.
You're only a boy.
Keep on there.
Go straight across the fields and through the woods.
You'll find the motorway.
Go south.
Kit. May.
The children will show you the way.
Remember, go south.
There's nothing in the north for a boy like you. Good luck.
Come on.
- Where are you making for?
- London.
In a hurry?
- Why?
- Like to pick up some spare cash?
- What for?
- Nothing much.
Scientific research. Medical.
You know the kind of thing?
We need volunteers.
- How much?
- Hundred quid.
Hundred and fifty and you're on.
I'm not authorized to vary the terms, sir...
...but if you'd like to come up to the centre, you can talk it over with the chief.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Welcome to the Millar Clinic.
Will you take a chair, please?
- Will you take a chair, please?
- Oh, thank you.
Your full name, please, sir.
Michael Arnold Travis.
- And yours, madam?
- Elizabeth Valerie Stewart.
E. V. Stewart.
- M. A. Travis.
- How much are they paying you?
Hundred and fifty pounds.
I'm getting 75 and all the food I can eat.
Professor Millar will be with you in a minute.
You must have inhaled at least
3 milligrams of Novocain.
Sir.
So that's a distinct improvement.
- Doctor Bee?
- Sir? Yes, professor?
I'll be coming into your department at 11.
I'll want Mrs. Unwin under the pathescope.
We may have to remodel her transplant.
- Certainly, professor.
- How long is it now?
- Three hundred and fifty seven days.
- Frenkel in Boston...
...kept one surviving for 14 months.
I'd like to beat him.
You will, sir.
- Professor Millar...
- one moment, Houston...
The new intake is ready, professor.
Splendid.
Oh, Professor Millar, can I borrow a heart from the organ bank for three days?
I'll have to come back to you on that one, Houston.
We may need everything we've got this week.
- Delighted to have you here.
- Very well.
- I'm Professor Millar.
- How do you do, sir.
Do sit down.
Excuse me.
Interesting.
Good.
I'm delighted to have you here.
I'll see you both later.
Sister Hallett,
Room 9 for Mr. Travis...
...and 36 for Mrs. Stewart.
I'll want a complete analysis on Travis by this afternoon.
Yes, professor.
Hughes, Keating, please.
Waterworks, okay?
Yes, fine, thank you.
No inherent madness in the family?
No, none whatsoever.
Where's she taking my suit?
Don't worry, you'll find it in your wardrobe.
- Just flex your wrist.
- Ever seen insects...
...crawling up the walls? No fits?
No, never.
- Ready when you are, Stanley.
- No typhoid, cholera, epilepsy?
Usual jabs at childhood?
All right. Here we go.
Hello. E.X. At 82 percent.
- Are you sure?
- Well, have a look.
Frontal circuit 7.4, rear lobes neutral.
Step it up a bit.
J. M. Will be happy about this.
Michael, I don't know if anyone's ever told you this...
...but you happen to belong to a very rare group of encephaloids.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Essentially, it means...
...that you are in a position to be particularly helpful to us in our research.
What kind of research?
What do you think is the most successful animal that's ever lived on this earth.
The ant?
The dinosaur.
Do you realize that the dinosaurs dominated this globe for 140 millions years...
...before they became extinct?
Man has been on this planet for only a fraction over 40,000 years...
...and yet already he faces extinction.
In fact, the species will be lucky to survive beyond the year 2010.
Mankind has only one hope.
Science.
Technology is the survival kit of the human race.
Even the politicians realize this.
What they don't, or won't, realize, is that the technical solutions...
...are already within our power.
The entire population of India could be rehoused on the moon within 10 years.
It's only a matter of learning to live in a new way.
Absolutely still.
We have almost conquered the concept of disease.
With present transplant techniques...
...there is no reason why everyone shouldn't live to be 250 or 300 years old...
...instead of our present miserable 70 or 80 years.
We're on the verge of a series of discoveries that will transform...
...our conception of human life.
What's all this got to do with me?
Michael, at this very moment...
...in laboratories throughout the world, life is being created.
It's only a matter of years, perhaps even months...
...before we can produce a whole generation of new and far more fully adapted creatures.
I have a mongrel in the experimental wing here who can't tie his own shoelaces.
By the end of the summer, he'll be a contract bridge champion.
Falling in love, making love.
We'll no longer need to depend on this inefficient way of distributing random genes.
Computers programmed to select the correctly matched...
...DNA molecules will be able to produce an entirely satisfactory human breed.
This is the future, Michael.
This is the work for which I need your help.
Yes, but what's gonna happen to me?
Will I come out the same as I went in?
Not the same...
...better.
Now, I would just like you to sign this release form.
"I hereby consent to lease the Millar Research Clinic...
...all physical experimental rights in my body...
...for one week for the sum of 100 pounds."
I'd like to help, Professor Millar...
...but 150 pounds is definitely my minimum price.
Definitely.
A figure like that is just beyond us.
One hundred and fifty pounds, and I'm not going to argue about it.
A hundred and thirty.
A hundred and forty five.
A hundred and thirty five.
A hundred and forty.
Done. Sign by the cross.
Sister Hallett?
Yes, professor?
Give Mr. Travis a sedative.
Certainly.
Sleep well, Michael.
- All quiet?
- Yes, professor.
- No fluctuations?
- Quite stable.
I'll take him first.
It'll be a long job.
Four or five hours.
Do you think it'll take, professor?
There's an even chance.
- He's in reasonably good condition.
- Oh, yes.
- Is he sterilized yet?
- Not yet, professor.
- You better send for Doctor Bee.
- Yes, professor.
We require two injections during the night.
One at 12 and one at 4.
Is that understood?
It's all right.
How much are they paying you?
How much are they paying you?
Hello, is there anybody there?
For chrissake!
You could have killed me!
- Why don't you look where you're going?
- Are you all right?
Hey, cut the conference!
Look at my bloody suit!
Are you suing us or are we suing you?
- You going to London?
- Yeah, we were.
Can you give us a lift? Okay?
Yeah, come on, get in.
Sit in the back there and keep your mouth shut.
- Mind the board.
- It's the Golden Wonder.
Come on, Streaky. Aggravate the gravel.
If you don't take that castle soon, the National Trust will.
You're shivering.
I'm wet.
Take off that jacket.
And that.
Alan, pass us the rug.
And the bottle.
Take off your trousers.
Come on, strip off.
What? Here?
Get them off. This is Patricia.
She's very intelligent.
She's making a study of us.
Thank you.
What are you? What do you do?
They're musicians.
We just trying to make some bread, that's all, mate.
Are you rich?
No, but my manager is.
Careful of those. That's gold thread.
Nylon.
Checkmate, Dave.
Never mind, at least you got it wrong.
Come over here.
Waifs and strays, she never could resist.
- How long?
- About an hour. Maybe less.
~ On and on ~
~ And on and on we go ~
~ Round the world in circles turning ~
~ Earning what we can ~
~ While others dance away ~
~ The chance to light your day ~
~ Oh, and on and on ~
~ And on and on we go ~
~ And it's round the world in circles turning ~
~ Earning what we can ~
~ While others dance away ~
~ The chance to light your day ~
- Patricia?
- She's upstairs.
Upstairs.
~ Boy, and if you have a friend
On whom you think you can rely ~
~ You are a lucky man ~
~ If you've found the reason
To live on and not to die ~
~ You are a lucky man ~
~ You know the preachers, and the poets ~

Morning.
- How do you feel?
- Hungry.
Could you hold this for me?
What is it?
Om.
It means infinity, or godhead.
Are you a Buddhist?
All religions are equally true.
Breakfast.
London.
The biggest money market in the world.
Did you know that?
Ten thousand million pounds a day turnover.
Ten thousand millions a day, and there's a thousand ways of making it, you know?
It's just a question of picking the right one.
Open this.
Champagne.
Of course.
Glass palaces.
Just look at them.
One day I'll own one of those.
You're very old-fashioned.
What do you mean, I'm old-fashioned?
Well, all this stuff about money and owning things.
If you want something, just take it.
I always do.
Where did you get this from?
Home.
Do you go there often?
Sometimes. When I get bored.
And where does all this other stuff come from?
That comes from home too.
Daddy's got so much he never misses anything.
You're lucky.
I've got to get there on my own.
- Get where?
- Right to the top.
How much is a building like that worth?
The ground rent is 800,000 pounds a year.
It cost 10 times that to build.
And every three months its value increases by 20 percent.
How do you know?
My father owns it.
Really?
It's beautiful.
I'd like to meet your father.
You've got lovely eyes.
Introduce us then.
I've been a top salesman.
Earned 100 pounds one week.
You're so greedy.
Tell me more about your father.
He owns half the copper mines in the world.
He's absolutely ruthless.
For every 5 million pounds he invests...
...he makes half a million pounds profit.
In Bolivia...
...he drove half a million peasants off their land.
They starved to death.
Fifty million pounds profit.
He's the most evil man you could ever hope to meet.
Are you coming or staying?
Coming.
Hey, where are you going? Don't go.
Have a good day.
Remember...
...all that glisters is not gold.
Hello, can I speak to Mr. Burgess, please?
Yes, yes, of course, sir.
Sir James, yes.
Well, it's about his daughter.
Yes, it's very urgent.
I'm sorry, but it's absolutely confidential.
It's a matter of life and death.
Well, you'll just have to interrupt him then, won't you?
Hello, Sir James?
Hello, I'm Michael Travis.
It's about Patricia. She's in trouble.
Well, she's safe at the moment but I'm not sure how long it can be guaranteed.
No, Sir James, I really cannot discuss this on the telephone.
I'm sure you understand.
Well, I do have rather a full afternoon but I could see you in say, 45 minutes.
No, Sir James, I'm not a psychiatrist.
Good. Oh, by the way, Sir James...
...which is your nearest tube station?
Thank you.
Mr. Travis?
Would you mind taking a seat and waiting a few moments?
- Sir James is still in conference.
- Thank you.
It's only a question of time.
Another six months is all I need.
Three?
No, no, no!
- You rotten bastard! You swine!
- You must calm down.
Can't you see it's a revolutionary concept?
Twenty five years of my life.
Twenty five years wasted.
Twenty five years down the drain.
- Oh, God! All wasted!
- Professor...
- Professor, you must restrain yourself.
- You bastard! You swine!
Professor.
Help me. I won't go. I'll never go.
Don't let them do it.
Miss Hunter, two Valium and a barley wine for Professor Stewart.
William, a chair for Professor Stewart.
Mr. Travis.
Sir James' time is worth
500 pounds per minute.
Please keep it short.
Mr. Michael Travis, Sir James.
Well, young man.
I won't beat about the bush, sir.
It's your...
I won't beat about the bush, sir.
It's your daughter, Patricia.
She's in bad trouble.
What kind of trouble?
Well, sir, the usual.
Bad company, protests, drugs.
Oh, all that. Yes.
I think we can save her, sir.
I think she should come back to her family...
...a family background.
Do you even know where she is, sir?
It must be heart-breaking for you,
Sir James.
You amaze me.
She needs you, Sir James.
How strange.
The trouble is, I'm so frightfully busy.
No, no, no.
- I'm not gonna stand for it.
- Professor.
- Professor, please.
- I'm going back in there.
All right, if that's what you want.
But here, now, in front of your very eyes, Sir James.
- Now!
- William.
William, stop him at all costs.
- Professor, please.
- Now, now.
- Professor, for God's sake.
- Let me go!
Let me go!
- Miss Hunter.
- Yes, Sir James.
Ask the senior staff to come to my office.
I'm afraid I have some very grave and distressing news for you.
Professor Stewart is dead.
Professor Stewart started life 55 years ago...
...of humble parentage.
His father was a watchmaker in Glasgow.
At the age of 16, he gained a scholarship to Cambridge.
During the war his vital research into the military application of electronics...
...led to his rapid promotion to the rank of major.
After the war...
...he gave to this company the same loyalty that he had before given to the nation.
Now, Professor Stewart was not only an inventor of genius...
...but all who came in contact with him felt it a privilege to have known...
...and loved him.
Sir James, it's 10 past 5.
Your appointment with Dr. Munda.
Thank you, Miss Hunter.
Professor Stewart was too far in advance of his time...
...but his name will live long.
We will stand in silence in grateful memory for 15 seconds.
Miss Hunter, send a memo to the chief accountant.
A gratuity of 740 pound per annum to his widow.
Fix the funeral for Wednesday,
Golders Green.
And get me Vancouver.
Pity about Stewart.
Brilliant man, of course, but an academic.
Couldn't run a toffee shop.
In business there's an animal who succeeds and an animal who doesn't.
That may be my call to Vancouver.
Vancouver, Canada, Sir James.
Charles? James.
I talked to the board.
Unanimous decision, I'm afraid.
We'll have to have your resignation by midnight.
No.
Two million dollars compensation is our maximum.
Well, it's your decision of course.
But if you don't...
...things could be pretty upsetting for Kitty.
Yes.
Bye.
- Good evening, Sir James.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Sir James.
- Sorry to keep you.
Had a little hold up at the office.
- My assistant, Michael...
- Travis.
- Travis.
- Morrison.
- Pleased to meet you.
- This way, sir.
Sir James, how good of you to come.
Mr. President.
My minister of finance,
Mr. Timothy Souza.
- How do you do?
- Madame Paillard.
My home secretary, Mrs. Naidu.
- How do you do?
- Colonel Steiger.
- Colonel.
- Sir.
- Mr. Oswald.
- Sir James.
And the Right Honourable Basil Keyes,
I think you know.
- Basil.
- James.
Do sit down, Sir James.
Morrison, draw the curtains.
Sir James...
...you are a man of business.
You deal in facts and figures.
Well, that is what we are here to give you today.
My colleagues and I are confident...
...that we can offer you an association with our country...
...that will be as profitable to you as to ourselves.
Film please, Brewster.
The coastline of Zingara...
...an uninterrupted stretch of golden sand, perfect for swimming, water sports...
...and all the leisure facilities demanded by holiday makers...
...from the industrial centres in Europe and the Americas.
The island already boasts one large hotel.
Visitors can take their ease in surroundings of luxury and sophistication.
- A brandy, please.
- Yes, sir.
Picturesque entertainment is provided by Zingaran natives...
...performing their age-old rituals...
...for patrons of our holiday lodges in the hill district.
Here in surroundings of peace and calm...
...staffs are being specially trained satisfy
European demands for courtesy and service.
A massive program of hotel construction is already underway.
Experienced European engineers are supervising the native labour force...
...in the construction of the Zingara Continental Hotel.
Your brandy, sir.
The completed hotel, with its splendid public facilities...
...provides 500 rooms.
Each with colour television and private bathroom.
Thank you, Brewster.
Very attractive.
But your plans for industry?
Our free export zone will offer generous advantages...
...to all concerns financed by foreign capital.
Repatriation of profits?
Mr. Souza.
Guaranteed to any country you care to nominate.
Venezuela, the Vatican,
Liechtenstein, et cetera.
Oh, thanks very much.
Labour costs?
My home secretary, Mrs. Naidu, will explain the favourable arrangements...
...we are planning for this area.
Labour conditions in Zingara offer excellent opportunities...
...for the foreign investor.
Rates of pay and working conditions are regulated by the government.
Consequently, strikes and slowdowns are a thing unknown.
Film, Brewster, please.
The efficiency and variety of our light industrial installations are a joy to behold.
The Bumangi sausage factory has a daily output of over 2000 pounds...
...prime first-quality sausages.
All 75 percent genuine meat.
Special attention is paid to cleanliness.
Experience has shown that production levels benefit considerably...
...when the sexes are segregated.
The workers' living quarters are also segregated.
Here is an ultra-modern male workers' camp on the outskirts of Bikana.
Their women are housed in a similar camp some 35 miles distant.
Male workers are paid the equivalent of 7 New-English pence per day...
...and females, at 3.
Foreign technicians are welcome in Zingara.
Life for our foreign visitors will be fully commensurate...
...with the standards of living and convenience...
...enjoyed by their colleagues in America or the European Common Market.
They will also be exempted from all personal income tax.
Thank you.
Thank you, Sir James.
Well, Sir James.
I hope we have convinced you that Zingara today presents a unique opportunity...
...for secure investment and a high rate of return.
There is just one consideration...
...that troubles me, Mr. President.
- Please.
What guarantees can you provide for the safe-guarding of investment?
I refer, of course, to the threat of insurrection.
Sir James...
...I will be completely honest.
It is true that a small element of our people...
...have been attempting to cause unrest in our northern territories.
This problem we have firmly in hand.
We're fortunate to have the services of Colonel Steiger...
...whose achievements in the Congo,
Nigeria and more recently, Bangladesh...
...must be well-known to you.
I have asked Colonel Steiger himself to report on the situation.
The rebels number roughly
2000 men and women.
Projection.
They are operating in the northern territories in two main groups.
My counter-offensive has taken the form of a two-pronged blitz...
...blanket bombardment by artillery and aircraft...
...followed by landings of airborne policing detachments...
...employing scorched-earth and random-elimination techniques.
My men are professionals, experienced in guerilla warfare.
The rebels are amateurs, inexperienced and weak in defence.
So insurgent losses are heavy.
Over 300 killed.
Four hundred and fifty captured and interned.
In view of your undoubted superiority,
Colonel Steiger...
...can you tell us why this insurrection still persists?
The terrain is unfavourable, sir.
Jungle and swamp favour the native.
That is why we need honey.
Honey?
Precisely.
Your British honey.
The substance known as PL-45.
Or in the terminology of my profession, "honey."
Let me show you some examples.
Slide, please.
This is a man who has received a light exposure to this invaluable weapon.
And again.
And again.
And again.
And again.
A beer mug full of honey can create a lethal zone...
...for all forms of terrestrial life within an area of 15 acres.
Low-flying aircraft spraying PL-45...
...can cover 100 square miles in two hours.
Thank you.
This is all I need to finish the job.
Impressive.
But you understand, Colonel Steiger...
...that granted supplies of adequate quantities of honey...
...you are prepared to guarantee the internal stability of your territory?
You have my word.
Basil, a moment.
Champagne, monsieur?
- Thank you very much, ma'am.
- Please.
Thank you.
Glad to see you made it, old boy.
Stick with the old man.
You'll run a good wicket. Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Yes
Yes.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I don't think you've met my new assistant, Travis.
Travis, this is Basil Keyes.
I could send Travis along sometime tomorrow.
We've got a night sitting, that should finish before lunch.
- So anywhere near the House of Commons.
- Right.
Mr. President, I'll take these documents home with me, if I may.
Study them thoroughly.
I shan't keep you waiting.
- Well, it must be all of 40 years.
- Thirty nine.
- I shared digs with the president's brother.
- How nice.
I shall never forget that wonderful spring morning in your room at Balliol.
You and Peter drunk on the bookshelves.
Karl Marx and Keynes on the floor.
- How is Peter?
- In detention, alas.
I was urged to hang him but for once I was weak.
"Power creates the man." Tacitus.
Cheers.
Thank you, Warner.
About half an hour.
- She never gets out of bed.
- Oh, rotten luck.
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.
- Hello, Frank.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Mr. Travis will have a...
- A dry martini, very dry.
- Dry martini, Frank, and a large scotch.
- Thank you, sir.
I don't think you'll run into any trouble.
They've got their briefing.
They're all good chaps.
Everything's under control.
Good luck.
And don't leave any fingerprints.

Singing by your windowpane ~
~ And the sun shines bright all day through ~
~ Don't forget, boy
Look over your shoulder ~
~ Because there's always
Someone coming after you ~
~ You ~
- Like a brandy, Warner?
- Not for me, sir.
- I never touch a drop on the job.
- Of course, of course.

Seems just as it should be ~

~ And he dreams of a better life ahead ~
~ Without that dream

~ Dead ~
~ Dead ~
Hello, there.
- There you are.
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you. Travis.
- Wallis.
- Had a good run down?
- Fine, thank you. Fine.
Got the bumf, have you?
Good.
Nearly there.
Good, good, good.
We're over here.
Sergeant Beevers.
We've got the okay to take off.
Do the necessary, will you?
Yes, sir.
Ground control to pilot/navigator.
Destination Honey.
Flight AT-060 is Zingara International Airport.
Take off one-five minutes.
Roger, ground control. Will do.
- Sign by the cross, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
Twelve thousand gallons of the stuff there.
You could do half East Africa with that, Mr. Travis.
And of course, it was your flag that went up and ours that came down.
And the extraordinary thing was that the duchess never even noticed.
That will be all, thank you, Jenkins.
Well, gentlemen, to business.
Sir James, we would like the first instalment.
In cash.
Travis.
This is the combination to the safe in my study.
You will find a case there.
- Bring it here.
- Sir.
- Please, darling.
- Please, Dickey.
- But you must.
- Oh, don't go on, Dickey.
I've never been very sure of myself.
Not until I found you.
You drink too much.
I know.
You're my last chance.
Oh, little Dickey.
My God.
Michael.
Patricia.
What are you doing here?
This is my home.
- Well, who was that?
- Dickey?
The Duke of Belminster.
He's an old friend of mine.
What does he want?
He wants to marry me.
Well, you can't.
I might. I haven't decided yet.
But I love you and I'm going to marry you.
Look.
Oh, Michael.
You're so hopelessly conventional.
I told you I was gonna be a success.
And I am.
I did warn you.
Wait here for me.
Thank you, Michael.
Sir James, we need a witness.
Travis.
Who?
I see.
Yes.
Of course not.
Show them up.
The fraud squad.
Now, please, everyone, keep quite calm.
Inspector Carding is a very decent fellow.
Mr. Souza, if you please.
Travis.
Put those in your pocket.
The case please. Sit down.
Hold this.
Inspector Carding.
Good evening, inspector.
Good evening, Sir James.
- I'm sorry to disturb you, Sir James.
- Not at all.
I think you know everybody here.
Except perhaps my new assistant,
Michael Travis.
He hasn't been with me very long.
It is Mr. Travis I wish to interview.
With your permission, of course.
Now, is there anyone here you recognize?
Yes.
That is the man.
Thank you, Beevers.
I beg your pardon, Mr. Travis, may I have that bag?
Just a minute.
Did you sign this, sir?
Yes.
Is this your signature, sir?
Yes.
Is this your signature, sir?
No.
Is this your signature, sir?
Oh, no.
Complete forgery.
Not worth the paper it's written on.
Bag, please.
Do you realize it's an offence to export bullion from the U.K. Without...
...the permission of the Bank of England?
- Yes.
When I came into this room, that bag was in your possession?
Yes.
Would you mind, sir?
All right, Michael.
Trust me.
I'll take that, Carding.
I'm so sorry to have disturbed you,
Sir James
Dr. Munda.
The dividing line...
...between the House of Lords and Pentonville jail is very, very thin.
~ We all want justice
But you got to have the money to buy it ~
~ You'd have to be a fool
To close your eyes and deny it ~
~ There's a lot of poor people
Who are walking the streets of my town ~
~ Too blind to see that justice
Is used to do them right down ~
~ All through life from beginning to end
You pay your monthly instalments ~
~ Next to health is wealth
And only wealth will buy you justice ~
~ And money and justice ~
~ Money and justice ~
~ Money, justice ~
- deposit account of innocence.
Now, Travis, was given a position of great trust by his benefactor.
One of England's most eminent industrialists.
He repaid that trust...
...by seeking to export for his own gain,
10 million pounds...
...of his employer's money.
Was this the action of an innocent?
If such perfidy can be committed without fear of retribution...
...then how can the rule of law, patriotism, duty...
...the very basis of our society, hope to survive?
Well, go and consider your verdict carefully.
And take your time.
Be upstanding in court.
Be upstanding in court.
Members of the jury...
...have you arrived at a verdict on which you are all agreed?
- We have, My Lord.
- Do you find the prisoner guilty...
...or not guilty?
- Guilty, My Lord.
May I say how entirely I agree with that verdict.
The prisoner will stand to receive sentence.
Society is based on good faith...
...on a commonly accepted bond.
It is the inflamed greed of people like you,
Michael Travis...
...that has led to the present breakdown of our society.
Before I pass sentence, have you anything to say?
My Lord, I did my duty.
I only wanted to be successful.
I did my best.
And you failed.
I am innocent, My Lord.
I sentence you to five years hard labour.
Come on. There we are.
Yeah.
Come on. Come on.
Yes. Come on.
Let's have a look at you.
There we are. Be gentle, be gentle.
Let's have a look.
Oh, that's better.
Yes, there we are, hold still.
Yeah.
All right, Travis, you've done your stretch.
Now smarten up for the governor.
Well done, lad.
Well, Travis, you're free.
Free to rejoin the world of decent, ordinary men and women...
...who are content to earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brows.
The brotherhood of man, Travis.
I know where I went wrong, sir.
I've been thinking.
Good lad.
I've read books...
...and I see things differently now, sir.
Well, now, tell me.
Have you...?
Have you any plans?
No plans, sir.
I just want to get out there and learn to be a proper human being, sir.
I'd like to...
I'd like to read you something.
I think it may help.
"One that never turned his back but marched breast forward...
...never doubted clouds would break...
...never dreamed that wrong would triumph...
...held we fall to rise...
...sleep to wake."
I'd like you to have this.
It belonged to my grandmother...
...but you may find it will help you through the difficult days that lie ahead.
Thank you very much, sir.
I've sensed the spark of idealism in you...
...and that can move mountains, you know that?
Oh, for a man like you, Travis...
Michael, for a boy like you, you're still young.
Everything is possible.
The world is your oyster.
I can see you stripped, building motorways.
You have eyes like Steve McQueen.
Did anyone ever tell you that?
Goodbye, Travis.
And good luck.
MacIntyre.
Biles.
Eccles.
Travis.
Goodbye.
Bye, Frank.
Goodbye, old chap.
I'll send you a postcard.
Goodbye.
- Lawrence!
- Mommy!
Thank you, Michael, for everything.
Goodbye. Best of luck.
Thank you.
On your own?
- On your own then?
- Yes.
- Anywhere to go?
- I'll manage.
Just a minute.
- Do you want a lift?
- No, thanks. I'm going the other way.
Here.
- What is it?
- Down in the East End.
Give you a start there.
Be good.
I won't be seeing you anymore.
Well, good luck.
It may not be as easy as you think.

~ It makes the wounded spirit whole ~

Thank you very much.
~ 'Tis manna to the hungry soul ~
~ And to the weary rest ~
Would you like to help?
Oh, sure I would.
Are you sure you can spare it?
Gladly.
- You're from the prison, aren't you?
- That's right.
There's no need to be ashamed.
I'm not ashamed.
Glory, hallelujah!
Major! Major!
Major.
~ boundless stores of grace ~
...and he's just come out of prison too.
Brothers, today we have with us a young man...
...who has turned over a completely new leaf.
He has only just left prison...
...yet he has given generously of his meagre store.
Glory, hallelujah.
Friend, will you step up beside me and bear witness?
Bear witness? What to?
Your sins.
I don't believe in sin.
Everybody sins. We know.
Brother, be warned, you stand in great danger.
I thought like you once, sir, but now I've learned better.
People are good if you give them the chance.
Oh, excuse me.
- Oh, sorry. You all right?
- Sorry, sorry.
We've got to start with humanity.
We must try and trust one another.
People are good.
Everyone has goodness in them.
It's poverty.
That's why people commit crimes.
It's not poverty, laddie.
It's the old Adam pride, envy, gluttony, sloth.
A great philosopher once wrote something I'd like you all to hear.
"My country is the world, and my religion is to do good."
Tom Paine.
Tom Paine denied God.
He believed in mankind.
Brother, we will pray for you.
Let us all kneel together, friends.
Oh, Lord, look down in mercy on this, our misguided brother.
Guide his feet into the way of life.
Remove the blindfold from his eyes.
Lift up his gaze to the eternal hills...
...from whence cometh our only help.
Amen.
Bringing in the sheaves.
~ Sewing in the morning
Sewing seeds of kindness ~
You bird! It's too flipping short!
Look at him.
What are you trying to do, pick apples?
He thinks he's picking apples.
Here, you. You.
- Yeah, you.
- No, not you. You.
Bring up that blinking bar.
- Just behind you.
- The big one behind...
- That's right.
- That's right.
- Bring it up here.
- Up here.
- Quick.
- Come on, mate, move.
- Bring it up here.
- Up here, hurry.
- Quick, upstairs.
- Come quick.
Mighty improvement you are.
Up here. Get this door open.
Give us your bag.
- Mrs. Richards.
- Come out of there.
Come on out.
She's put the bed against the door.
Double bolted it.
She's gonna do it this time, you mark my words.
Selfish bitch.
She's got the kids in there with her.
But she'll probably do them in and all.
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
She's gonna kill herself, that's what's wrong.
- Well, can't you stop her?
- Well, go on then, you stop her.
- Nobody's holding you back, are they?
- Mrs. Richards!
Mrs. Richards!
What you gonna do?
- It's dangerous.
- Oh, my God.
He'll never make it.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, now, don't.
Mrs. Richards.
Mrs. Richards.
Mrs. Richards, what are you doing?
Cleaning the floor, what's it look like?
What's all this about killing yourself?
I've had enough.
You've been shut up here too long.
Think of the world outside.
Mrs. Richards. Now, please stop it.
I want you to listen.
My husband has to find the place looking nice.
I'll not have him saying
I did wrong in the end.
You should meet some people.
Make some nice friends.
I haven't been out since we had Penny.
Not in six years.
- Well, take a holiday.
- Harry's off work.
- Hasn't had a job for four years.
- Well, think of the children.
- I mean, they're the only ones who matter.
- How can I keep a child clean?
How much do you think a pair of kid's shoes costs?
The cheapest? One pound twenty.
Life is a gift, Mrs. Richards.
You haven't the right to throw it away.
Look, this is the food I buy each week for ourselves and the kids:
Seven loaves of bread,
20 pounds of potatoes...
...three quarters of a pound of tea, a packet of porridge...
...two packs of cornflakes.
- There's always tomorrow.
One pack of Co-op soap powder, three or four pounds of cabbage...
...two swedes, custard powder...
...baked beans, sometimes, tinned tomatoes, sometimes...
...tinned spaghetti, sometimes, lettuce, when cheap.
Food isn't everything.
Fresh air! Sunshine...
- Penny!
- Yes, Mum.
Bring the Brasso.
Now, I want you to go over there, love.
Wash the big pan under the hot tap.
Get out every bit of tomato soup before your dad gets back.
Mrs. Richards...
Mrs. Richards...
Please listen to this, Mrs. Richards.
Now, please listen.
"Life is mostly froth and bubble, two things stand like stone.
Kindness in another's trouble, courage in your own."
Who said that?
Adam Lindsay Gordon. He was a poet.
More of a fool, if you ask me.
Well, wait then, Mrs. Richards.
Now, wait, Mrs. Richards.
Wait, Mrs. Richards.
Listen to this. Please, Mrs. Richards.
Mrs. Richards.
Tell Harry to leave a note for the milkman.
Two pints.
- Penny.
- Yes, Mum?
"There's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow." Hamlet.
Go on, go and sit over there.
Be a good girl.
Please listen, Mrs. Richards.
Please listen to this.
Now, this will really help, Mrs. Richards.
Please listen carefully.
"One that never turned his back but marched breast forward...
...never doubted clouds would break."
Don't do anything rash, Mrs. Richards.
Every cloud has a silver lining,
Mrs. Richards. Mrs. Richards!
Mrs. Richards!

- Have you got any jam?
- Yes.
Tuck in.
Hello, a new face.
Oh, don't by shy. Down on your luck?
Here, you get this inside you.

- Thank you.
Arthur, you are making a mess.
I'll do that for you.
He likes it thick.
Oh, super. Thanks awfully.
Oh, good girl, Vera. That's lovely.
- Jam?
- Thank you so much.
There.
Arthritis. Incurable.
Be dead in six months, poor old thing.
- Do you do this every night?
- Whenever I can.
Well, I have so much time in the evenings.
Do you get paid for it?
Good Lord, no. It's just that one has to do what one can to help.
Can I help?
That's extremely kind.
I can use all the help I can get.
Here, you grab hold of this.
Any more cups, please? Won't be a jiff.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Good night.
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night.
They do so appreciate it.
Even I need sleep, of course.
It gets a bit of a grind on one's own.
Even the strongest stumble.
But one does what one can.
Now, do you see that bonfire over there?
That's all my regulars.
Now, you just toddle across and give them their soup.
You'll find some of them a bit touchy, but they're all real characters.
Yes, but what shall I say?
What shall I do?
Well, it's simple, just be yourself.
Don't put on an act. They don't like that.
- Well, where are you going?
- I've got the railway stations to do.
Oh, leave the impedimenta at the side of the road.
Be back about 5.
Bye.
Bye!

Hot soup?

Do you have any pepp...?

Sorry, son, I can't take solids.
Hot soup?

I thought you were going to marry the Duke of Belminster.
This is the Duke of Belminster.
Leave him alone.
We don't want your filthy charity!
Get back to school!
Get out of here!
- Listen, friends, comrades...
- Go back to nanny!
- Listen to me, comrades.
- Join the army!
- Listen to me, brothers.
- Brothers? We ain't your bleeding brothers.
You're men. You must realize it.
Men, mankind, brothers...
...it's the only truth.
- Truth?
This is the only truth, you bastard.
Man!
No, it's you, me, all of us.
We're all there is. Only man exists.
Man, listen to it.
What a marvellous word.
Isn't it a marvellous word?
It's fantastic. We must respect it.
We must respect each other.
Not charity, not pity, but dignity, respect.
I know, I swear it.
We must love one another.
Love!
Brothers!
Brothers, brothers, brothers!
Brothers!

Swan. He has no other name.
His past is a mystery, but his work is already a legend.
He wrote and produced his first gold record at 14.
Since then, he's won so many...
...that he tried to deposit them in Fort Knox.
He brought the blues to Britain.
He brought Liverpool to America.
He brought folk and rock together.
His band, the Juicy Fruits...
...single-handedly gave birth to the nostalgia wave in the '70s.
Now he's looking for the new sound of the spheres...
...to inaugurate his own Xanadu, his own Disneyland...
...the Paradise, the ultimate rock palace.
This film is the story of that search, of that sound...
...of the man who made it, the girl who sang it...
...and the monster who stole it.
It seems like yesterday
I found Annette in that church choir.
I got her singing lessons, taught her how to dress, got her first gig.
I paid off a columnist.
He did a beautiful story on her.
I told her who to be nice to, who to...
I fed her drugs to get through the tours, made her record a hit.
Then you made her the biggest thing in rock.
So now what does she do?
She fires us, cancels Vegas...
...and gives free concerts for gook orphans.
She was more than a piece.
She was the light of my life.
And now she's gone.
There'll be a 20-minute intermission before the next show.
We sued her. We couldn't lose.
We had an ironclad contract.
It was a lock, it was over, it was closed. I even bribed the judge.
He said we couldn't sign anyone to a life contract.
Called us a disgrace to the profession. A disgrace.
I made her the moneygrubbing whore she was, and I'm a disgrace?
- What do you want me to do?
- Break her.
- Is that all?
- Isn't that enough?
Annette is nothing, finished, washed up.
- She's at the top of the charts.
- That's today, Philbin.
Tomorrow she'll be forgotten.
We have more important business.
- The Paradise.
- I know. We've looked everywhere...
Listen.
What?
That's it.
The music to open the Paradise.
- I've finally found it.
- That creep to open the Paradise?
No, not him. The music.
Listen to the music.
What do I do with him?
You'll think of something.
- Mr. Leach?
- Hello.
My name's Arnold Philbin.
I scout talent for Swan.
He's interested in your stuff.
- The Swan?
- That's right.
- He said your song could be big.
- Really?
I was right there.
If he produced my music, the world would listen.
The game plan exactly, but you need a lot of work, polishing.
I know. I have a long way to go.
- Do you have any tapes of your stuff?
- No, but it's all written down here.
- Give us two or three good up numbers.
- Two or three?
This cantata is 200 or 300 pages, and I haven't finished yet.
Forget the sonata.
We just want the songs.
- It's not just songs. It's much more.
- I don't get you.
It's a whole series of songs that tell a story of Faust.
- Who? What label's he on?
- He was a legendary German magician.
He sold his soul to the devil for worldly power.
What is this, kid? School time?
A song is a song.
You either dig it, or you don't.
Now, I like your stuff, kid.
It's terrific. And you know what?
I think the Juicy Fruits will dig it.
I'm not promising anything. First...
I won't let my music be mutilated by those greaseballs!
- Only I can sing Faust!
- It was just an idea.
Swan makes all these decisions, you know?
I'm sorry. It's just that
I worked so hard on this thing.
- It's okay. You sure got a temper.
- I'm sorry.
- I don't know what comes over me.
- Just relax. Take it easy.
Give me the music. Swan will take a look and get right back to you.
But if you ask me, I think we're gonna produce your first album.
Really?
- Hello. I'm Winslow Leach.
- Yes?
Mr. Philbin said Mr. Swan would call about producing my record.
He said he'd get back to me.
That was a month ago.
One moment, please.
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
Follow that car.
- Where did you get that song?
- From Philbin, to audition with.
- Sing it again.
- Why?
Go ahead. Sing it.
That's incredible.
How'd you know it went like that?
- I wrote the song.
- Then why aren't you with Swan?
- There must be some mix-up.
- Oh, sure.
Your name's not on the music.
Swan heard me sing this. Why's he auditioning girls for my cantata?
- I only sing it solo.
- Haven't you heard?
- He's opening the Paradise with it.
- You're kidding.
- I look like a kidder?
- He's using my cantata?
- Isn't that great?
- I wish he'd told me.
He's just auditioning girls for a backup chorus.
You're a fine singer.
You shouldn't be in a chorus.
I don't care where I sing this music.
Hey, look. Could you help me?
I can sing these songs better than anybody.
With your help,
I can get in the chorus.
- I'd love to help you.
- You're not just being nice?
Personal desire never influences my aesthetic judgment.
- What's that mean?
- It means I think you're terrific.
Do you?
Everybody get in line, gotta quick it up a bit. Move in quietly.
One, two, three, four...
Come on, come on.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Wait a minute. Stop.
What's that, a boyfriend?
- I'm the composer.
- Great.
- Swan's only seeing girls.
- I must see...
If you wanna see Swan, call and make an appointment.
- I got thrown out.
- They don't wanna see you.
- But I wrote the music.
- Just get out of here!
- Winslow, I'll tell him you're here.
- I'll wait for you. Good luck.
Why won't he just let me sing?
It was awful.
- What's the matter?
- Philbin tried to... I can't do it.
- I came here to sing. Leave me alone.
- Did you tell him who I am?
- What's your name?
- Hey! Come here, buddy.
- Where's a good department store?
- We'll take you.
- When do we get to sing?
- Not much singing happens here.
I've been here 12 times, and I still haven't sung.
- What do you do here?
- You'll see.
- Can't you sing on your back?
- I've never tried.
If you can sing standing up, you can sing lying down.
- Take your slip off.
- No, I'm saving it for Swan.
- Do it now.
- You're being auditioned right now.
- What?
- The whole place is bugged.
- You're kidding.
- No, Swan's watching us right now.
- Come here.
- What are you doing?
- He likes to watch us.
- Watch us doing what?
- Doing each other.
- Really?
- It turns him on.
- Does he like blondes?
I like blondes.
Do you mind?
I hate to bother you, but...
That's right, I...
Just hold me close. I just...
I need someone to help me warm my voice up.
Swan!
Mr. Swan, you remember me.
I'm Winslow Leach.
May we rehearse?
Over here, Swan.
- Get this fag out of here.
- It's me. Winslow. Don't you remember?
I gave Mr. Philbin a copy of my cantata, Faust.
You were gonna look at it.
You're auditioning girls for my work.
I'm Winslow Leach! I wrote it!
Where are you taking me?
Telephone.
That's him.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Are you some kind of pervert?
- No, sir. I'm...
- I'm Winslow Leach, the composer.
- What are you doing outside Swanage?
Listen, officers, you gotta help me.
Mr. Swan's got my music.
He pretends he doesn't know me.
He had me thrown out and beaten up.
- He didn't want to buy what you had.
- He said nothing about buying.
Jack, what's that he got in his purse?
I don't know, Joe. Take a look.
- I think I will.
- Mr. Swan said he had it on him.
What do you know?
Smack, Jack.
- You know the penalty for pushing?
- Life!
But I'm innocent!
Swan stole my music and framed me!
Welcome to Sing Sing.
We're very fortunate to be included in the Dental Health Research Program.
This is a volunteer program funded by the Swan Foundation.
You are all volunteers.
All your teeth will be pulled.
Teeth are a source of infection.
It pays to be on the safe side.
Sir?
Pardon me. I'm not a volunteer.
I'm innocent. I don't want you to take my teeth out.
How many men here are innocent?
Raise your hands.
All innocent.
Good morning, everyone.
Swan can deposit another golden disk in Fort Knox.
The Juicy Fruits on the Death Label has taken the charts by storm.
Friday night, you can see them at the grand opening of the Paradise.
Swan's rock palace...
...is scheduled to open at last with this dynamite sound.
So let's hear it again. The
Juicy Fruits singing Swan's Faust.
Get away from the record press.
- Let's move this ladder now.
- What's that?
I shove the tire in his mouth.
Then he really gets mad at me, you know?
This is the last time we go through it. See Swan?
He's listening and watching, so don't make me look bad again.
All right, let's get going here, will you, please?
Let's get it going over here.
Get the car over there.
All right, girls.
Just a second, Linda.
You got a very nice body.
We want to see some skin.
- It's cold. It's just a rehearsal.
- You're not paid to be cold.
- Don't touch me.
- You wanna get paid?
- Yeah, I wanna get paid.
- Get back on the car.
Come on, let's move it out of here.
We've gotta get some thin girls here.
- Where are you going?
- I gotta get out of here.
- What sign are you?
- Leo.
You're okay. I gotta get out of here.
- Come on, I wanna show you something.
- I swear to God.
Do you see Swan up there?
He doesn't show it, but he's thinking:
"Why isn't Harold in the car?"
Do you really want me to tell him that it's not in the stars for you?
I don't feel good.
You'll feel worse if you don't do what I say.
- I hear this ticking.
- Maybe something's loose up there.
- There's something weird here.
- Take one of these.
- I can't take pills...
- Take the pills, swallow. Feel better?
- Yeah, I feel better.
- No more ticking?
Get out there. All right.
Come on, get this car out.
Girls, I want big smiles now.
Look at the audience. That's it.
Big smiles. Sing the song.
Winslow, good to see you.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Killing me won't help you.
My God, you're horrible.
Don't rush off.
Look at yourself.
Look at yourself!
What's that horrible sound?
Can't you talk?
Look around you, Winslow.
You've destroyed your face, your voice.
Now you're trying to destroy the Paradise. Haven't we had enough?
I can give you the power to create.
I'll make you somebody.
We'll have to start over, only this time working together.
The time for your sound is now.
People will want to hear your music.
Tomorrow, I'll put a whole new group together who'll do your songs.
Come to the auditions.
You'll see for yourself. Trust me!
Trust me.
Next!
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Phoenix.
- Let's see what you got.
- Do I get to sing this time?
- You mean you're really a singer?
- Yes, I'm a singer.
Try to forget it. We're not looking for singers. We're looking for screamers.
I'm not a screamer. I'm a singer.
Phoenix.
Swan here.
- I want you to answer a question.
- Yes?
What would you give me to sing?
Anything you wanted.
Anything?
Would you give me your voice?
Try me.
She's good...
...isn't she?
Then let's talk.
Filters.
Dolbys.
Perfect.
- How's that? Try it.
- Phoenix.
Try it again.
And again.
At least you can talk. Plug yourself into the console to sing.
- You really think she's that good?
- Too good for you.
I'll hire her anyway.
She could be my voice now.
Could she? Really?
Stop terrorizing the Paradise and rewrite your cantata...
...for Phoenix. We'll both win.
You get your cantata sung by the right singer, I open Paradise.
We can't waste time.
Lock yourself up in here and write.
- I could write for her.
- It'll be performed here live.
- Phoenix will star.
- My cantata. For her.
I'll get fantastic musicians.
The hall has...
I don't trust you.
You ruined my music before.
Forget about the Juicy Fruits.
Who wants nostalgia anymore?
- I don't trust you.
- No need. Here's a contract.
Everything I've said and more is in it.
- I'll read it.
- At your leisure.
"The party of the first part gives the party of the second part...
...full power to do with him at their pleasure, to rule, send, fetch...
...or carry him or his, be it either body, soul, flesh or blood."
- What does that mean?
- That's a transportation clause.
"All articles...
...which are excluded shall be deemed included."
- What does that mean?
- That's a clause to protect you.
Anyway, what difference does it make?
What choice do you have?
I'll rewrite my cantata, but you'd best play what I write.
Ink isn't worth anything to me, Winslow.
Now sign.
Excellent.
And now we're in business together.
Forever.
I'll rewrite my cantata, but you'd best play what I write.
Ink isn't worth anything to me, Winslow.
Now sign.
Excellent.
And now we're in business together.
Forever.
Tasty, Winslow, tasty.
- But I thought you liked her, boss.
- I do. She's perfect.
But you know how I abhor perfection in anyone but myself.
Then Phoenix is out?
No, not out. Just a backup singer.
My cantata needs something really heavy.
No, no.
Wrong again.
Pretty, but no.
No.
There's something here like...
- How come we don't get to take photos?
- They have exclusive rights to him.
- Where's he coming in from?
- Transylvania. Swan will go anywhere...
Remember, no pictures of Swan.
Gentlemen, I want to tell you of our latest work. An opera.
A kind of pop cantata.
It was written by the late Winslow Leach.
It is about a young man who sells his soul to the devil...
...to become a pop star. It'll be the first rock version of Faust.
We'll be recording at the Paradise, Friday night.
Live on the Death Label.
- Mr. Pizer.
- Who's singing this? The Juicy Fruits?
No. They're a reflection of the past.
Gentlemen, I give you the future:
Beef.
Winslow. Good morning.
- What day is it?
- Thursday. Today is Thursday.
Breakfast.
A little pick-me-up.
How's it coming?
Don't mean to rush you.
Don't worry. It'll be finished.
How's Phoenix?
- I can't wait to hear her sing.
- Doing beautifully.
Can't wait to meet you, by the way.
Tomorrow's the big night.
Tomorrow night.
You better get a castrato.
This is a little out of my range.
- Something bothering you, Beef?
- This was scored for a chick.
- I'm not doing it in drag.
- You sing it better than any bitch.
You don't know how right you are, Goliath.
Okay, boys, from the bridge. Hit it.
- Who says I can't sing it?
- I like it. Keep working on it.
Drop an octave here, change a line there.
Make it completely yours.
Let's go.
Far out.
Doesn't that change the whole thing?
You heard him. Make it yours. If it's good, who cares what it's about?
Is that so?
- Nobody cares what it's about.
- Is that right?
- Who listens to lyrics anyway?
- Dry up, tubbo.
Seal it now.
This creep gets no comps.
My music! Swan!
- What was that?
- What was what?
I knew I shouldn't screw around with a dead man's music. This place...
...is possessed.
- What are you talking about?
- Didn't you hear that shriek?
That was something trying to get out of its premature grave.
Opening night prima donnas.
Look, iron man...
...you're uptight. Take a shower.
- My pleasure...
...Bones.
Never sing my music again. Not here, not anywhere. Do you understand?
Only Phoenix can sing my music.
Anyone else that tries, dies.
Let's see your tickets.
Everybody's got to have a ticket.
- Everybody have a ticket. You got one?
- Sure.
Get back in line.
Take care of the rest of the line.
Open the gate.
Where do you think you're going, Tinkerbell?
- Cincinnati, to see my mother.
- You're gonna miss the show.
- There ain't gonna be no show.
- What?
Listen, Philbin.
There really is a phantom.
He was just in my shower.
He threatened my life. He said his music is just for Phoenix.
Only she can sing it.
Anyone else who tries, dies.
What the hell are you talking about?
Look, Philbin, I am a professional.
I have been in this business a long time.
I don't want to do the show.
Not because I got stage fright...
...but because some creature from beyond doesn't want me to.
- Bullshit! What really happened?
- Can't you feel the vibes?
Bad, sport, real bad.
The karma's so thick, you need an Aqua Lung to breathe.
- I know what it is.
- Why don't you tell me?
- Speed, that's what it is.
- What do you know about it?
You just pass it out, I take it.
I know drug-real from real-real.
- Do me a favor and take this.
- No, that'll bring me down.
You better come down.
You better get yourself together.
You got a show to do. It's opening night. Can you still sing?
Sure, I can still sing.
The Phantom! Help!
Somebody get a fire extinguisher!
We want Beef! We want Beef!
We want Beef!
Somebody get rid of him.
- Get out there and sing.
- You're crazy.
Someone killed Beef so you could sing.
If you don't, there'll be more bodies.
- Is Beef...?
- Dead.
But let's not talk about that.
Let's talk about you.
I like your name.
We won't have to change it.
You're going to be a very big star.
We'll finish the cantata tomorrow night...
...we'll record, we'll go on tour and then...
There are no words to express what you're going to become.
I'll do anything you want.
I owe you everything.
- Just give me that crowd again.
- Tomorrow night.
- Tomorrow night, they'll be yours.
- Mine.
And all I want...
...is your voice.
Is that all?
No.
We'll go to Swanage and celebrate.
I'll wait for you in the car.
He wouldn't listen to me.
- Where is she?
- Have you ever seen such a crowd?
- I never want to see another one.
- They've been entertained.
They never want the show to stop.
The Paradise is more magnificent than I dreamed.
- How often is a star fried on-stage?
- It's an attraction.
- Don't hurt me.
- I would never hurt you, Phoenix.
You know me?
I'm Winslow. Remember?
- But Winslow is dead.
- No, not quite.
Who are you?
Why do you wear that mask?
Because Swan has taken my voice, my music...
...and given me this. And now he wants you. But you're all I have left.
No one will sing in this Paradise again, no one will sing my Faust.
No one but you. Leave this place, or I'll destroy you too.
Why should I go with you? Don't you hear them? Why should I give that up?
They want much more now.
More than you could ever give.
- I'll give them whatever they want.
- No!
Get your hands off me!
With that freak, the Paradise is done.
It's beginning.
Tomorrow, Phoenix will finish Faust.
There she is.
- Beef's killer is on the roof.
- Get the police.
Don't think about it. Tonight is your night. I won't have it ruined.
Swanage.
What a foolish thing to do.
Didn't you read your contract closely?
See where it says
"terms of agreement"?
"This contract terminates with Swan."
No more suicides.
You gave up your right to rest in peace when you signed the contract.
But if you do find a loophole, forget it.
That stays sealed as long as I have the power to bind you.
If I'm destroyed, that gaping wound opens.
You might say we terminate together.
Now get back to work.
We need new love songs for Phoenix.
If you as much as say boo to anyone...
...you'll never see Phoenix again.
Oh, yes, about the love songs.
- Perhaps a duet?
- Never.
I'm under contract too.
Do we get to shoot pictures of you tonight?
Is it true you'll wear a mask on-stage?
How can we shoot you if you have a mask?
You can't, fools.
It was genius, making the end of the opera a wedding.
Faust, instead of burning in hell, he gets the girl?
And you will be the priest.
I've never been a priest before.
That's terrific.
Swan, you remember me, don't you?
You do, don't you?
- Do you know him?
- We went steady in high school.
- You're old enough to be his mother.
- This was taken 20 years ago.
My God! He doesn't look any different.
Saturday...
...November 19, 1953.
Today, I have decided to kill myself.
In being the greatest showman of my time...
...I'm recording live for the Swan Archives.
Why?
Simple.
I'm getting old.
I can't bear...
...to see this beautiful face ravaged by the forces of time.
If I can't be young forever...
...I'd rather end it all. Now.
- Why not?
- What?
Stay young forever.
I'm real. And I'll leave if you want. But you did call me.
I didn't call anybody.
You said you wanted to be young forever.
Well, here I am.
But I am stoned.
You're not real.
Then it really doesn't matter what happens, does it?
- What is going to happen?
- For openers, you'll look like me.
Forever.
This is too much. I guess you're supposed to be the devil?
- I go by many names.
- And you will make me young forever?
This image will age in your place.
This picture gets old instead of me?
Yes. And you must watch it every day, just to see how lucky you are.
- I'm crazy about pictures of myself.
- The tape from which it comes...
...must be guarded at all costs.
- Why?
When it goes, you go.
- What do I have to do?
- It's all here. Read it carefully.
Then sign at the bottom in blood.
- Blood? My blood?
- Messy, I know.
But it's the only way
I can bind you. Tradition.
What do you have to lose?
Nothing.
I was gonna use this on my wrist.
Your soul is damned either way.
What soul?
Don't waste it.
Now sign.
Ink isn't worth anything to me, Winslow.
Now sign.
Just sign this, and it will all be legal.
"Till death do us part"?
Mustn't be late for your own funer... Wedding.
Aren't we rushing things a little?
- Blood!
- Stop wasting it! Sign your name.
P-H-O...
She must be hit when Philbin says:
"Till death do you part."
This may not be my business, but why kill her here, tonight?
An assassination live on TV, coast-to-coast? That's entertainment.
When it goes, you go.
Do you, Phoenix, take Swan for your wedded husband?
From this day forward, for better, for worse?
- In sickness and in health?
- I do.
Do you, Swan, take Phoenix for your wedded wife?
From this day forward, for better, for worse. In sickness and in health...
...till death...
Oh, my God!
What's happened to your face?
Winslow!
I don't understand.
Your voice, remember?
You promised me your voice.
Our contract, remember?
Winslow.
All of us have something to say... but some are never heard.
Over seven years ago, the people of Watts stood together... and demanded to be heard.
On a Sunday this past August in the Los Angeles Coliseum... over 100,000 black people came together... to commemorate that moment in American history.
For over six hours, the audience heard, felt, sang... danced, and shouted the living word... in a soulful expression of the black experience.
This is a film of that experience... and what some of the people have to say.
That's what we did in 1965.
We all got crazy and went out... and started burning up our own neighborhood and shit.
That brought the man on their own land, man.
The thing about it was it did something constructive for the whole community.
That's the only beautiful thing that went off.
Thank you, whitey.
That's the only way we communicate with whitey, man.
You've never seen in a community as many markets.
They've opened up a Dr. Martin Luther King Hospital.
There's more black people in Watts... that were formerly on county and state aid that are employed right now.
Like your mama.
Your mama got a job for the first time in 10 years.
-Dumb-ass motherfucker.
-I'm talking about black people...
-like you, nigger.
-You know he's been drinking.
You lived on 103rd.
-He's not responsible.
-Shit. You know what?
Once half a whitey, nigger....
It wouldn't do no good to burn over in Inglewood.
Them motherfuckers ain't buying second-grade meat.
Shit ain't getting better.
They're still putting offices off into the area, man, shit.
-They're making money off it.
-But look, brother--
You'd be surprised... how much that building, that particular building... will satisfy so many niggers.
-Pacify them a little.
-Make them think... make them think it's progress.
Up until the point that we had a riot... everybody said, "Those niggers are all right, they're doing fine."
Then when we had a riot, then the white man said:
"Something's wrong, 'cause these suckers are burning down my store.
"Now I got to give these niggers something because...
-" I thought they was happy."
-But what did he give them?
They've changed some for the best... in an awful lot of cases for the worst... and some they have not changed at all.
There's no difference in Watts now than Watts '65.
California's a weird state because they have laws for pedestrians.
Like, you cross the street, they have laws for pedestrians... but they don't have laws for people at night... when cops accidentally shoot people.
They accidentally shoot more niggers out here than any place in the world.
Every time you pick up a paper,
"Nigger accidentally shot in the ass."
How do you accidentally shoot a nigger six times in the chest?
"Well, my gun fell and just went crazy."
It's going to be the best sound, though, that's ever been.
-I can dig it.
-So we're sure of that.
That's beautiful. I work in sound, also.
I'm hip to it.
This is the biggest and the best sound equipment around, in our opinion.
-How many people do you have there?
-Four, Mr. Van Peebles.
Okay, there'll be one more, which will be five.
Now, of those five people down at that end of the tunnel... there will be three and two... three on the gate and two in the dressing rooms.
When the gate slows down after the festival gets underway... we may then put three in the dressing room, and two.
Now, the rest of you gentlemen....
As the first Black Queen of Miss Watts at the Watts Festival... and the Watts Beauty Pageant... how do you feel about this concert today?
It's beautiful.
I think it's a very beautiful endeavor.
It's beautiful, that's what it is.
It's great, what can I tell you?
Fantastic.
It's a hell of a feeling.
I think it's beautiful.
Like, shit, a whole thing is going on, you know?
Ladies and gentlemen,
our national anthem.
I don't have a damn thing to fight for,
and I got no country... and I don't have no flag.
I ain't got a damn thing to fight for, go up there, get half my ass blowed off... and come back home, and can't even draw unemployment...
-let alone find a motherfucking job.
-There's a lot of funky things... in this country, and there's good things, too... but you run into more funky than you do good.
Why can't we, as being the people, without revolution... you know, without political, social and economical change... be a part of America?
-I can say it in one word, brother.
-What's that?
-Politics.
-Thank you.
First time I discovered I was black... was at the Interstate Fair in Pensacola, Florida.
It was one of those things.
I was standing there...
I was working behind this little counter where you throw the balls... to knock over the milk bottles.
This one cat threw the ball... knocked down two of the milk bottles.
One of them was for certain, one almost fell... and he said that I kept it from falling over, and he spit on me.
Called me a black, nasty, lying nigger.
My brother... made me realize
I was a nigger, 'cause he's high yellow.
You dig? He's lighter than I am, right?
So we was playing with some people, you know, just running around... doing this, doing that, and then they called him over.
We was playing with some white kids.
They called him over... and they whispered something in his ear.
So we went home. We was going home... and my brother jumped up and told me I was a nigger.
I looked at this sucker 'cause, shit, I didn't know what a nigger was.
But these white boys, they identified with him because he was light-skinned.
So he went in and he told my mother that I was a black nigger... and that he was a white boy.
You dig? But, see, my mother's bad.
My mother checked that out, so she said:
"Okay, cool with it. I'm not your mother, because all my kids are niggers."
When I told my mother what happened... that this white girl had called me a nigger, and what does it mean?
So she said, "Wait till your father gets home, he'll explain it to you."
When my old man got home,
I told him about it... and he kind of gave me a weird look... and he said,
"Look, let me tell you something."
He said, "The next time somebody calls you a nigger...
"just kick their ass. Don't ask no questions, just kick their ass."
I think like niggers are the best of the people that were slaves.
You know what I mean?
And that's how they got to be niggers.
'Cause they stole the cream of the crop from Africa and brought them over here... and God, as they say, works in mysterious ways.
So he made everybody a nigger
'cause we was arguing over in Africa... about the Watusi, the Huwagada, the Zagumbo, and the Zamunga.
You know.... In different languages.
So he brought us all over here... the best, the kings, the queens, and the princesses and the princes... shit, and put us all together and called us one tribe: niggers.
This is a beautiful day.
It is a new day.
It is a day of black awareness.
It is a day of black people taking care
of black people's business.
Today we are together.
We are unified and on one accord.
'Cause when we are together,
we've got power...
and we can make decisions.
Today, on this program
you will hear gospel...
and rhythm and blues, and jazz.
All those are just labels.
We know that music is music.
All of our people got a soul.
Our experience determines the texture...
the taste, and the sound of our soul.
We say that we may be in the slum...
but the slum is not in us.
We may be in prison...
but the prison is not in us.
In Watts, we have shifted from.:
"Burn, baby, burn, " to "Learn, baby, learn. "
We have shifted from having a seizure...
about what the man got...
to seizing what we need.
We have shifted from bedbugs
and dog ticks...
to community control and politics.
That is why we gather today...
to celebrate our homecoming...
and our own sense of somebody-ness.
That is why I challenge you now
to stand together...
raise your fists together...
and engage in our national black litany.
Do it with courage and determination.
I am...
somebody!
I am...
somebody!
I may be poor...
but I am...
somebody!
I may be on welfare...
but I am...
somebody!
I may be unskilled...
but I am...
somebody!
I am...
black...
beautiful...
proud!
I must be respected!
I must be protected!
-What time is it?
-Nation time!
-When we stand together, what time is it?
-Nation time!
When we say no more, "Yessuh, boss, "
what time is it?
-Nation time!
-What time is it?
Sister Kim Weston,
the black national anthem.
Won't you sing it with me, everybody?
We've got some difficult days ahead...
but it really doesn't matter with me now.
Because I've been to the mountaintop...
and I don't mind.
Like anybody, I would like to live...
a long life. Longevity has its place...
but I'm not concerned about that now.
I just want to do God's will.
And he's allowed me
to go up to the mountain...
and I've looked over...
and I've seen the promised land.
I may not get there with you...
but I want you to know tonight...
that we as a people
will get to the promised land.
So I'm happy tonight.
I'm not worried about anything.
I'm not fearing any man.
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord!
I remember, we used to go to a movie house.
It wasn't a church, you know?
It was a movie house.
And the thing.... It used to bug me, man,
'cause it was like... every place else you went to something like a church.
But in a black neighborhood, man, you had to go to a movie house.
But when you got in the movie house, man, it was bad.
I mean, the people got down.
I remember going in there, man... and I used to go to a Catholic church, and I went to a Methodist church...
I went to all them other churches, man, but then I went to this black church... in Oakland. And we went up....
I went up, and I saw tambourines and trombones... and drums, and I said, "This is church?"
I don't understand this, man.
And the people.... The preacher got up and started talking about God... and I was listening, and I said:
"l never heard anybody talk about God like this before."
This cat started talking about God and what God did.
And then he got this band going behind him, man... and the band started getting into it, man, and the cats was playing, and shit.
And I said, "Goddamn! "
And I started feeling good.
I'm reminded of the two thieves...
nailed beside him.
I believe one of the thieves said.:
"lf thou be the Christ...
"why don't you save thyself and us?"
And the other said.:
"Lord...
"remember me. " The Lord said.:
"This day...
"thou shall be with me...
"in paradise. "
I remember he and his 12...
on a ship sailing afar,
when all of a sudden...
the sky was filled with darkness...
the sea was raging...
the lightning flashed, the thunder roared!
The ship was rocking back and forth,
they were so afraid...
so afraid.
And I believe I heard a voice...
I believe I hear this voice now.
I believe I hear a voice crying out now...
I believe I hear this voice crying...
saying....
When I hear the choir sing like
Amazing Grace, I start thinking about... when my great-grandmother died.
She died of cancer.
I was young, but... the music, it just sets a thing.
You get a thing inside.
Every time I hear that song,
Amazing Grace...
I start thinking about that.
And when they really get to going, really get to jam...
I used to dig that, because I'd be right up there with them.
And my people right here would jump up and get happy.
I'd be wanting to jump up and get happy, too.
And then the building beats up, boy, and they get to jumping and shouting... shit, boy, they'd be getting down, boy, let me tell you.
And that comes from being black.
And now we're going to bring back
Stax's Golden 13.
Let everybody say yeah!
I love that gospel.
I know gospel better than I know...
God damn me, blues, because the white man wrote my Bible... and the thing that most black people try to live by.
You know, I used to go to church and shit, like I was saying... but black people know God personally.
Any wino you meet know God... right? Or Jesus, at least, right?
"Jesus Christ? Shit, man, he live over there, in the project!
"Shit, tell me. I know peoples.
"l study peoples.
"See, I used to be in the FBl.
"I'm the first colored person ever in the Bureau.
"J. Edgar Hoover appointed me personally, posthumous.
"That's right. He wanted somebody on the railroad to guard the Mexicans.
"See, 'cause nobody in the Bureau at that time could speak Mexican talk.
"See, I spoke to them. They'd be...."
I'd say, "What you say, motherfucker?
"They'd tell me."
Well, listen, we all know
what we're here for.
We really want you to have a great time.
We're here to commemorate
a revolution...
that started the movement...
and was one of the milestones
in black pride.
Some folks may find it a little strange
that we laugh...
we sing, and we joke...
but we're doing our thing
the black way to commemorate.
And now, one of the most popular groups
in the nation...
The Staple Singers!
I think that there's more awareness of....
There's more search for awareness with black people... as to where we are and what has happened to us... and what we're going to do with it.
I dig the natural.
I think the natural is a beautiful way of wearing your hair... for all black people.
When I get up in the morning, I'm natural.
And that's the way my hair is all day long.
Kids is what make me feel so good.
You see, you're looking at the glory that's coming up into the future of life.
The younger youth is what's gonna make everything... to keep going after I done passed down the hill.
Young, gifted, and black.
I be a Democrat every now and then.
I be a Muslim, I be a Panther.
But I'm always being black.
I'm not prejudiced, because some of my best friends are colored... if you know what I'm talking about.
Black is beautiful because it feels so good. lf black is beautiful, white is divine.
Now, that nigger's crazy.
Don't call you black, you're a Negro.
You sound like them kids in school.
You ever know them dudes?
They get madder than a motherfucker.
"Say, black boy."
"Say, man. What you mean, black?
"Baby, I'm colored.
"l don't play that shit."
My parents was like that.
In my neighborhood, used to be some beautiful black man... would come through the neighborhood, dressed in African shit. Really nice shit.
And he'd be,
"Peace, love, black is beautiful.
"Remember the essence of life.
"We are people of the universe.
Life is beautiful."
My parents would go, "That nigger crazy."
I used to love to go to the meetings, when you get down.
I got ultra-black for a while.
Them brothers be rapping.
I never knew what they was saying.
But the brothers be having emotion.
"You see, the first thing you gotta know is about eating pork.
"Now, you eat a piece of pork...
"you don't realize the subtlefications of this individuality's prospect.
"What the man trying to lay on you through porkitis...
"you will not understand because the trichinosis of your mind...
"will not relinquish the thought of individuality.
"You know what I mean?"
Ladies and gentlemen, right about now...
the soulful, funky sounds of the Bar-Kays.
It's been said many times
and many places...
that freedom is a road
seldom traveled by the multitude.
We would like to invite each of you
to come and go with us.
And perhaps you'll see a side of life
that you've never seen before.
I'm the son of a badass!
Right now,
we'd like to give everybody a chance...
to get down.
Black people rip off one another.
I'll tell you which ones rip off one another.
It's the ones that don't know who the fuck they are.
As simple as that.
They don't know who they are.
Sometimes, it seemed the guys would rip me off so often...
I thought they were running the place instead of me.
It was just like them coming in and getting what belong to them. lf I can't work and make it,
I'll steal and take it. lf there was a way a nigger could put air in a bottle and sell it, he'd do it.
A nigger can sell anything.
I ain't gonna lie to you.
Anytime a brother would shoot another brother in his own neighborhood... then go to his funeral and turn over his own casket... they need to have the police down there.
The niggers are NAACP-ing.
Niggers ain't acting like colored people.
And we can't stand that.
But pimp, that's why.
Anybody that use somebody else to gain, he's pimping.
I'll tell you what, soul brother. Looky here.
Can't nobody pimp you but your pimp-ass self, you understand?
Somewhere along from the day I was born and up until now, something went wrong.
And I'm trying to figure out in my mind,
"Do it take another riot?"
I mean, a riot that's gonna include a lot of killing and things... in order to get this thing going the way it should be going.
We're tired of gaming, man.
We're tired of all this bullshit.
We wants jobs and, we wants everything, just like they got.
It's not getting out and confronting, and fighting the man on the street... because right now he's got the power, and he's gonna win.
What we got to do, we got to get our minds together.
I'm not gonna get up on Front Street and front myself off.
You be fronting yourself off every time you be coming out of your house.
You see the brother pushing pushcarts.
You see the lady bagging out.
See the brother standing up.
You understand?
But you know what you got to deal with?
The waking up and going to bed.
Once you get a job, nigger, be respectful.
This is the Age of Aquarius.
"Shit! Man, get a job?
"What the fuck you talking?
"l went down.
Man, I ain't bullshitting, baby.
"l went down to the unemployment bureau.
"You dig?
"l just got out the joint.
You know what I mean?
"I'm in the joint,
I go to the unemployment bureau...
"the bitch telling me,
'What's your occupation?'
"l said, 'Pressing license plates.'
"Where you gonna find a job for a nigger out here pressing license plates?
"And I'm a license plate-pressing motherfucker.
"You dig?
"Old bitch has got a tiara and shit up there.
"Old, ugly white whore with old wrinkles and shit.
"Bitch got funky with me.
I said, 'Fuck the job, bitch.
"'Kiss my ass. And your mama, too.'"
You know what I learned up in Soledad in '67?
-That you got to...
-You got to what?
...stay out the penitentiary.
And this number's
being especially played and dedicated...
to all of the blues lovers.
And to all of those
that's not hip to the blues.:
We're gonna learn them to you,
teach them to you, brother...
'cause we'll be around for a while.
You know how much shit
I've been through.
I done had three mothers in my life.
That's why I think... you see a man walking down the street by himself alone at night, lonesome... walking down the street about 6:00 in the morning... he'll stand in front of the mirror and say:
"Ricky, what are you doing?"
And he'll say, "Doo doo da doo," and start singing the blues. You know what I mean?
I like the blues. I don't like the jazz.
I'm too old a man to like a lot of that.
The blues.
People have to have something they can relate to for right now.
I don't mean tomorrow, but right now.
You dig what I'm saying?
The blues is past tense.
That's the black man's cousin, the blues.
-I've been down so long...
-Tell them why.
...that getting up don't even cross my mind.
Yes, I've had the blues.
I've had men that I really liked, that I really loved.
And they have a change of heart, a change of mind.
And there you are, standing there with your heart in your hand.
Just like if you had an old car, and it kept stopping on you.
This is what I've experienced with the blues in many ways.
Not just being in love.
Although, that's one of the hurtingest blues you can have.
You know what I told her when she called me on the phone?
I said, "Honey, I done married again.
"l got me a good wife, and forget about you."
Yes, sir. "Forget about you."
'Cause that's all I wanted of her, is to let me alone.
But I loved her, boy.
You know what? I tell you what.
I'd work, I'd buy.... I'd wear jeans, boy.
She'd go to church with furs.
I ain't lying.
$200 and $500 bracelets, big ring on her finger.
Singing in the choir.
And I got two jobs to support that goddamn woman.
You know that?
And that's the honest God's truth.
You take care of business, far as I'm concerned.
Who? Do you know she was pretty?
Man, she had my nose open.
-So I see that.
-She had my nose open.
I tell you what. And right today... every time I think about it, damn it, I get mad.
I used to cry over her.
I ain't lying. Sometime I'd be at the job... and I had to go and sit in the car for a few minutes.
They'd ask me,
"What's wrong with you, man?"
And I wouldn't tell them.
I didn't want nobody to know
I was weak, that weak, behind a woman.
I loved her, man. I ain't lying. I loved her.
Did she hurt you bad, man?
She tore me up.
She turned me against the whole female sex... as far as life is concerned for me.
Can't nobody give a sister the blues like her man.
That's the blues.
That's the sure-enough blues, really.
You ever had a woman that you loved, or a girlfriend or something... that you really felt like you couldn't make it without?
And along come one of them old hip dudes and slid her right out from under you? lf you didn't have the blues then... you're right, you don't know nothing about it.
A lot of people talk about Jody.
You know who Jody's supposed to be.
Jody is that fella... that when you leave home... at 6:00... he's in your house at 6:01 .
I want everybody to get in on this thing.
-You all feel it over there?
-Yeah.
You all feel it over here?
I'm gonna tell you all
a story about Jody, right.
Just wait a minute.
Honey, do you know Jody?
All the girls that know Jody,
let me see you wave your hand.
Johnnie Taylor.
You ever try to get in after hours?
We had a place called the Blue Note... with a blue window, and it had a note painted in the glass.
Right, you could look through.
You remember that? The Blue Note.
You'd be checking, looking through that peeled paint and shit.
They'd be getting down.
You'd try, "Curtis, you going in, brother?
Take me in with you, man."
"Guess....
"Fuck you, then. You don't have to take me no place, nigger.
"Come on, do something. You bad?
"I'm bullshitting, brother. I'm just playing.
But take me in with you.
"l got a little business. You know I'm gonna get it on. You know what I mean?"
The dude take you in with him.
You knock on the door like a speakeasy.
You have to knock all night.
Then the dude open it. "What you want?"
"Hank sent me."
"l don't know no goddamn Hank."
Then the nigger go off, right?
Nigger get mad.
"Say, motherfucker, what you mean you ain't gonna let me in this funky joint?
"Much money I done spent in here, nigger.
I knew your mom when she was whoring."
Right, then the dude let him in.
"Come on in, man.
I was going to let you in. Shit.
"You don't gotta talk to me like that.
"Shit, how old are you, boy?"
You have to lie. I say, "19."
"Nigger, you look 35."
Then you go in the back room.
White cats in Vegas. I was in Las Vegas.
They gamble different, very quiet like.
"$2,000 on the five.
"Oops, I missed. Gosh, gee whiz."
Niggers be talking about, "Hump, baby.
"Shit. Bet I do it over tom-tom.
"Save that nigger. Shit.
"Bar. Bet the bar. Off-time.
"I'm trying to make me some money.
"I'm hungry for hog meat. Slap, Jesus.
"Shit. Gotta be a Jesus
'cause too many black folks.
"Nigger, what, boy? I ain't got no money.
"Get up off me, motherfucker.
"Shit, I'm trying to get this six up off my ass.
"lf I six, we're going to have a new crap game. You can believe that. Shit!
"Borrow what, man?
I ain't got no money, nigger.
"I'm going to pay you.
"Goddamn. Nigger won't leave me alone.
Supposed to be my partner.
"Get me a beer or something, boy.
I'm trying to hustle."
You know, the nigger be,
"Seven! Motherfucker! Goddamn!
"Boy, you check that seven.
The man had his hand on the table.
"He hit the dice. Nigger ain't fade nobody.
"Shit. Fucked up my money. Jive turkey.
"Shit. Brother, what's happening?
"This nigger was down, fucking around.
"Let me have $2. Give me $2.
"Want to buy a radio?
"Dig, mama, it got 16 channels.
"Fuck you, too, nigger."
I love black women. I'm black.
All black women are my sisters, man.
The way the brother walks is beautiful.
The way he talks is beautiful.
The way he abuses me is beautiful.
The brother is beautiful.
The way he makes love to me is beautiful.
You know, that's my man.
She's behind me 100% .
She believes in everything I believe in.
And whatever I do... she go right along with me and do it at the same time... with no doubts in her mind... because she know that I'm positive, and that I'm out to get over... and that I'm going to try to get a piece of this country.
I have to be the lead horse.
I have to be in charge....
Not in charge, but I got to be on top of her all the time.
You think you're the boss between you and your old lady?
I know I'm the boss.
The reason why I know this is because--
Your old lady's so bad, she actually got you believing that shit.
No, the black woman has always been two steps ahead of her man. Always.
I'd say I prefer an older broad to a younger broad any day... because the understanding is here and not so much here.
A lot of people think with their mouth and not with their head. Like your mama.
But you're gonna get her physically first.
No, mentally, brother. Go for the head.
The first thing that's gonna attract you is the physical thing.
Ain't no sense in taking no head and leaving the rest. Take the whole thing.
When a woman steps out the door, if you decide you wanna jam her, jam her. lf she can accept it, it's beautiful.
Let me tell you the truth.
I think I've had more women... than both of you cats put together a thousand times.
We're not ready for all this bullshit we getting from the black man.
We not taking it anymore like we used to.
That mean I have sex with between eight, nine and ten... between the hour of 7:00 in the morning and the hour of 12:00.
Now that nigger's crazy.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to present to you...
the lady that did such a wonderful job
as hostess on the television program...
this morning of the Watts Festival...
Miss Gee Whiz.
Come on, let's meet Miss Carla Thomas.
All right.
I remember the time I was a kid.
My dad would hide in the back of the house... when a bill collector come knocking on the door.
My mom would have to go to the door and face him.
She'd tell him a lie or curse him, whatever it took to get him away from the house.
My daddy would hide in the back.
He was afraid.
This went on years past that time.
Black women would always be the man, so to speak.
When it comes to confrontation with white people... the black male was always kind of afraid to face the man.
And the woman had to face him.
That is the problem that stems between the black man and the black woman... today, because she wants to control and rule and run him, and you can't do that.
He cannot survive and get free... under the same thing that his mama and his sister and his wife put on him... way back there, when she had to do it to keep him from getting lynched.
Usually a black man is kept in the background.
Now they're coming up forward and I love that.
You let me find me a good black man.
I'll be damned if I let him go anywhere.
I always said I'd never fight over a man, but you let me have a good black man... the bitch can't say shit to me.
She will get her ass kicked. I don't play it.
The one thing
I really don't like about black men is: all the black women that there is...
I don't understand why they would... prefer white women, or whatever... when there're lots of black women... who can do more... than a white woman.
A white girl that digs black brothers... that want a black brother....
I done had experience with a few of them.
And they do the nigger right.
In his soul, in his heart... in his spirit, in his being... he does not actually feel the white woman...
'cause the white woman ain't hip to mustard greens and cornbread.
You dig what I mean?
The white woman ain't hip to his little tricks.
A brother can play tricks on a white woman... and she can't cope with it.
All she can do is say yes.
But there are certain tricks that he can't play on a sister. lf you get out there and pick up a stray broad off the street... don't think you gonna get a whole lot, because you ain't.
You're not. That's why I condemn all black men, black women... that get out there and get whitey,
'cause it ain't shit.
Some niggers I know like Chinese women.
Ladies and gentlemen...
let's meet and greet...
Mr. Rufus Thomas!
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah!
-I said, can I ask you something?
-Yeah!
Ain't I'm clean?
Fellas! Thank you.
-You all ready for it?
-Yeah!
-You all ready for it? Here it is!
-Yeah!
Hey, Mr. Rufus Thomas!
Come on, Rufus, tell them about it.
-Tell them about it!
-Can you hear me out there?
Yeah!
All right, I want everybody....
Don't want nobody on the field, not yet.
Now when I tell you to get on the field...
then you get on the field.
Then I just might get out
on the field with you.
All right. Here we go.
You all ready?
Okay, here we go.
You all ready?
-You all ready?
-Yeah!
Okay, here we go.
Now, wait a minute.
We all together out here.
We all gonna have some fun.
But you ain't supposed to have your fun
on the ground.
You're supposed to be in the stands.
More power to the folks
that's going to the stands.
And I wish the mike cord
were long enough...
I'd go in the stands with you.
More power to the folks
that's going to the stands.
Ain't no problem at all, fellas.
It ain't what you got, it's what you know
what to do with what you got.
So all of you, will you please....
All you people right in there...
please go to the stands.
Please. With a capital "P. "
Come on, you all, please go to the stands.
That's right. Might be a little slow,
but you just got to go.
So, how about it, brother?
Power to the people that go to the stands!
Power to the folks! Let's go to the stands.
Power to the people!
Let's go to the stands.
Please go to.... Don't jump the fence
because it don't make sense.
You and that upside-down umbrella.
I'm talking about you, fella.
He don't mean to be mean,
he just want to be seen.
Look, you ain't no Indian, lady,
but you going have to get off the field, too.
Now whatever you do now, please.
Now, will you please hold what you got?
Yeah, that's a brother, all right.
Yeah, that's a brother, all right,
but I'll be damned if he's my brother.
Somebody told him he's cute
and he want to try to show it off out there.
Standing there, looking just like the thing
that eat up my grandpa 's dog.
See, the good part about it...
the very good part about all that,
now he knows he's wrong.
But if you go out there
and try to tell him he's wrong...
then want to try to whoop
everybody, see?
See, he's got his fists up now.
See what I'm talking about?
And that's what you call our black brother.
Now you all get him off.
You all got out there and get him off.
Get him off, you all! Get him on off.
Just take him right on off
and everything will be all right, y'all.
They'd arrest me, especially at night.
They have a curfew, right?
Niggers have to be home by 1 1 :00,
Negroes, 12:00.
And you'd be trying to get home.
Doing your cool running shit.
Always they'd catch you out in front of a store or something...
'cause you be taking shortcuts, right?
Cops: "Put your hands up, black boy! "
You panic. "All right, don't move! "
You be scared to death.
"Put your hands against the wall! "
"There ain't no wall." "Find one.
"Put the handcuffs on him, Fred."
They put the handcuffs on, and I was really skinny.
They'd slip off and the dude would get mad.
"All right. Put them on his ankles or his ass or something."
They handcuffed my thighs, right?
Hopped me to the car.
Then they call my father about 4:00 in the morning.
"Mr. Pryor, we have your son down here at headquarters.
"What about it?" "Fuck him."
You know.
And my mother'd have to beg him to come get me out.
"Please, Bucky, go get him."
"Fuck that nigger."
"l told him to be home at 1 1 :00, and I meant 1 1 :00!
"Goddamn, every time I turn around, that nigger's in jail.
"I'm tired of getting him out."
I'd be praying he'd have a heart attack before he'd get there...
'cause he'd put some shit on you.
"I'm gonna get your ass out.
'Cause you know I'm gonna tear your....
"How much is it, man?
$12? Yeah, I'll pay it.
"And you know I'll get your ass.
Yeah, you can believe that shit."
And my mother be crying:
"It hurts me more than it hurts you."
I'd say, "Yeah, let him beat your ass."
Here he comes.
This is the man
that put romance in your hearts.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Luther Ingram!
I can't believe you don't mess around, man.
Yeah. Everybody mess around.
Even married men mess around.
What's to keep your old lady from messing around?
Some of your best relationships are with married women... because they aren't able to take a lot of your time.
I fall in love seven days a week and love everybody.
What's your old lady's name, man?
That ain't none of your business what's her name.
What do you mean, "What's her name?"
No, man, you say your old lady's beautiful,
I just want to know who she is.
You might know her already. That's why
I'm not gonna give you her name.
I left my wife all thinking she was happy and everything.
And look here, there wasn't no boyfriend involved in this here.
And I come back home.
It was cold. January 27.
-That when she put you out?
-She didn't put me out.
-What happened?
She hired her a van line and moved.
I don't mess around with any of my partners' old ladies... who are married, you know?
When I go by there, it's a thing that I respect, man.
But I figure there's enough women out there... for a brother who's supposed to be your partner, you can go out there and catch.
Don't mess with someone's old lady.
All of them, I respect them and their old lady.
The old lady, if she forced me into a thing, really forced me... man, I wouldn't punk out. I'd rip her, but--
I know one thing. lf I was going out with one...
I'd always try to stay out the other fella's way.
Have you ever, in your life... had to jump out of a window behind a woman?
Have you been caught in a bed with a woman?
Yes, I have.
-ls that where you got this from?
-Hey, look here....
The lineup. See, the lineup, man, is a thing that....
I used to be in Peoria, it's a small town.
I'd be in the lineup for entertainment on Saturday nights...
'cause there wasn't nothing to do.
Know what I mean?
'Cause ugly white women used to say they got raped by niggers.
"A nigger raped me."
And nigger guys be going:
"Are you sure?"
They'd go round up some niggers.
You know, like:
"You were down last week.
Know what to do, don't you?
"Come on down again, will you?
We got to have a lineup."
It was a lot of fun unless you got picked.
Then it was your ass.
And then always at line up, you know, you'd stand up in them lights.
It'd be like acting to me. I loved it.
But some dudes didn't understand that shit. Just be:
The lights be, you know....
"All right, bring them out.
"All right, what's your name?"
"What's happening?
"l mean what am I charged with?
You know what I mean, man?
"l ain't did nothing, man.
I thought that was my mother's car.
"l went out to the bank.
"No, man, my mother told me....
I was downtown, you see?
"My mama said, 'Pick the car up in front of the bank at 2:15.'
"So, I got in the car,
I was driving down the street.
"l didn't know what was happening.
"This white lady was sitting next to me, screaming and shit.
"l thought it was a stickup."
There are specific instructions...
when lsaac Hayes comes on.
lf the barrier is broken...
lsaac will be immediately
taken from the stage...
and will not be allowed to return.
You must keep your seats.
Do we want to see lsaac Hayes?
-Yeah!
-Brothers and sisters...
we are now about to bring forth...
a bad...
bad.... I'm a preacher, I can't say it.
We're getting ready to bring right now...
the brother all of us have been waiting for!
The one we've been waiting for!
A bad, bad...
brother!
lsaac Hayes!
Thank you. Right on. Thank you.
Yeah.
Saturday night though was....
They always called it "nigger night" ...
'cause white folks go out about 8:00 and leave and go home at 10:00.
And leave it to the niggers,
'cause it gets thick.
They can't handle it.
I mean, too many niggers.
When they found out niggers could talk other than "do wah ho" ... they got scared to death.
Like one day somebody said:
"Nigger, talk."
-" I've been wanting to tell you something."
-" I beg your pardon?"
Now niggers got a handshake. lf you don't learn the handshake, see, niggers change their shit all the time.
Like, you be meeting a nigger, he'd go, "Hey, bro."
But then, niggers add.
Six months later, the shit changed.
You know, they'd be....
Be all down here, "Hey...." lf you don't do that, you ain't no nigger.
Dude be, "You ain't black, motherfucker.
You didn't even know how to do...."
I can go anywhere in the United States of America...
and see another black man
and give him a power shake.
And there's unity there.
There's a beauty that
I can communicate with this brother.
You can take black people
of many different shades...
that have obviously come
from different parts of Africa...
during the course
of this country's existence.
But they're still a brother.
But we grow up together, you know?
We are one.
I thank you for your tolerance
and your patience and your cooperation...
because we know this whole occasion
is for a worthy cause.
The good master helps them
that help themselves.
Right on.
I am...
somebody!
I may be on welfare...
but I am...
somebody!
I may be unskilled...
but I am...
somebody!
I am...
black...
beautiful...
proud!
I must be respected!
I must be protected!
-What time is it?
-Nation time!
-When we stand together, what time is it?
-Nation time!
When we say no more, "Yessuh, boss, "
what time is it?
Nation time!
-What time is it?
-Nation time!
English
- Good evening, Sergeant.
- Evening.
Get your hair cut, Mctaggart.
Ah, now, there's a message, Sergeant.
A message for us all.
However, there is a time and place for everything.
Get it removed.
Any serious problems while i've been away?
No, Sergeant, nothing serious.
Just the usual.
Rape, sodomy, sacrilege.
You know.
The lord is my shepherd
I'll not want
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green
He leadeth me
The quiet waters by
He leadeth me
The quiet waters by
"I have received of the Lord...
"that which also i delivered unto you.
"And the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed,
"took bread.
"And when He had given thanks,
"He broke it and said,
"take, eat.
"'This is my body,
"'which is broken for you.
"This do in remembrance of me. '
"And after the same manner, He also took the cup when he had eaten, saying,
"'this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
"'This do you, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me.
"'For as often as you eat this bread...
"'and drink this wine,
"'you do show the Lord's death... till He comes again. '"
That's for his nibs.
Postmarked Summerisle.
- He's got a bit of skirt over there, I bet.
- What, him?
The only woman he's interested in is the Virgin Mary.
- I thought he was going steady with Mary Bannorg.
- Steady's the word.
Two years, he hasn't so much as tickled her fancy.
He's keepin' himself pure for the wedding day.
Ah, poor old Mary.
I don't know what she sees in him.
When those two are married, she'll spend more time on her knees in church than on her back in bed.
All right.
Mornin', all.
- Morning, Hugh.
- Good morning, Sergeant.
Um, there's an anonymous letter for you, Sergeant.
Read it.
"Dear Sergeant Howie,
"none of us have seen May Morrison's daughter Rowan since last year.
"She's only 12 and has been missing... from her home for many months.
"She couldn't have left the island by herself.
"She's too young, and her mother won't say anything about it,
"just to mind my own business.
"Well, I reckon it's all our business when a kid disappears, that's why i'm writing you this letter.
"A child lover.
Summerisle.
P.S. I enclose a picture of Rowan Morrison. "
- Gonna go, Sergeant?
- Aye, aye, of course.
- Have you ever been there?
- Eh, no.
I've tasted the famous apples, of course, but, uh - it's odd, isn't it, all that fruit?
Well, the whole principality is odd.
To start with, they have no licensing laws.
Singing and dancing on a Sunday.
Oh, aye, doubtless that would appeal to a heathen brute like yourself, Mctaggart.
However, this is still, in theory, a law-abiding christian country, however unfashionable that may seem.
Well, I'll call in on this patrol.
Will you call in at Mary's house, tell her I'll be away overnight.
Oh, I am come
To the north country
Ochon, ochon,
Ochrie!
Without a penny
In my purse
To buy a meal
For me
One time I had
A hundred sheep
Ochon, ochon,
Ochrie!
Skipping o'er
Yon (that) narrow creek
And growing wool
For me
It was upon a lammas night
When corn rigs are bonnie
Beneath the moon's unclouded light
I held a while to Annie
The time went by with careless heed
Till 'tween the late and early
With small persuasion she agreed
To see me through the barley
Corn rigs and barley rigs and
Corn rigs are bonnie
I'll not forget that happy night
Among the rigs with Annie
Will you send a dinghy, please?
Did you hear me?
I'd like a dinghy, if you please.
Hello, sir! Have you lost your bearings?
No, sir, I don't think so.
- This is Summerisle, is it not?
- It is, sir!
Well, I'm right then. Now, would you send a dinghy, please?
I'm afraid it can't be done, sir!
This is private property!
You can't land here without written permission!
I, as you can see, am a police officer.
A complaint has been registered by a resident of this island about a missing child.
Now, that makes it a police matter, private property or not.
Now, will you send a dinghy, please?
Corn rigs and barley rigs
And corn rigs are bonnie
I'll not forget that happy night
Among the rigs with Annie
Good day to you, sir.
I'm the harbour master.
Sergeant Howie, West Highland police.
A missing child is always trouble.
Aye, aye, aye, for everybody.
Perhaps you would be good enough to explain matters to his lordship.
He's most particular who lands here.
All in good time.
We, too, have our own particularities.
You know her?
Her name is Rowan Morrison.
No, no, never seen her before.
I don't know the face either.
Do you know her, Kenny?
She doesn't belong to this island.
No, I never saw her before.
No, she doesn't belong here at all. Johnnie?
No, can't say I know her.
Now, now, what are you saying?
You're saying that she is not from the island.
Aye, that's right.
She's not from here.
Oh, you get Morrisons on Lewis and a few on Mull. I would try there.
Thanks.
"None of us have seen May Morrison's daughter Rowan since last year.
She's only 12, and she's been missing from her home for many months. "
The mother's name is May Morrison.
Oh, May! She quite slipped my memory.
Of course we've got May.
She keeps the post office in the high street.
- May Morrison? You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.
Well, thank you for your help.
That's not May's daughter, though!
No, she's not May's.
Then who is she?
The sky was blue the wind was still
The moon was shining clearly
I set her down with right good will
Among the rigs of barley
I kenned her heart with all my own
I loved her most sincerely
I kissed her o'er and o'er again
Among the rigs of barley
- Good afternoon!
- I like your rabbits.
Those are hares, not silly old rabbits.
Lovely march hares.
Can I help you?
- Mrs. Morrison- mrs. May Morrison?
- Yes.
- Sergeant Howie, West Highland police.
- Oh, my!
Did you come over in that aeroplane that I saw flying round?
- Aye, that's right.
- What, just to see me?
Well, no, not exactly.
I'm making inquiries about your daughter.
- We understand that she's missing.
- Missing? My daughter?
- Aye. You do have a daughter.
- Yes.
- And that's her?
- Oh, never.
I tell you no.
I think you'd better come with me.
This is our Myrtle.
She was nine last thursday.
She's not a bit like the girl in your photograph.
She must be at least
13 or 14, surely.
Myrtle, say hello.
This is Sergeant- oh!
- Howie.
- Oh.
- Hello, Myrtle.
How do you do? Look, mummy, I'm drawing a hare.
- Ah.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Hello.
- Here you are. You can fill in the ears in gray. Oh, sorry.
Thank you, Myrtle.
Myrtle, do you- do you know Rowan?
Of course I do.
- You do?
- 'Course I do, silly.
- Uh, do you know where she is now?
- In the fields.
She runs and plays there all day.
Does she?
Do you think she'll be coming back for tea?
Tea? Hares don't have tea, silly.
- Hares?
- She's a hare.
Rowan's a hare.
She has a lovely time.
- Well, tell me-
- Well, now, Sergeant.
You will stay and have a cup of tea, won't you?
- Oh, well, yes, yes, please.
- Good.
- That's very kind of you.
- Um, not at all.
It must be thirsty work, asking all those questions, eh?
- Ah, aye.
- Hello.
- Good evening. Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Hello again.
- Are you the landlord here?
- Aye.
I'm Alder Macgreagor. And you must be the policeman from the mainland.
Aye, that's right. Sergeant Howie,
West Highland constabulary.
I'm quite obviously not going to get back to the mainland tonight so I wondered if you had a room and a bite of supper I could have.
- Could you manage that?
- Aye, I think that can be arranged.
My daughter Willow will show you to your room.
Willow!
Father?
This is Sergeant Howie, a policeman from the mainland, who will be spending the night with us.
- This is my daughter, Willow.
- Good evening.
Show the Sergeant to his room, would you?
Much has been said of the strumpets of yore
Of wenches and bawdy house queens by the score
But I sing of a baggage that we all adore
The landlord's daughter
You'll never love another
Although she's not the kind of girl
To take home to your mother
Her ale, it is lively and strong to the taste
It is brewed with discretion never with haste
You can have all you like if you swear not to waste
The landlord's daughter
And when her name is mentioned
The parts of every gentleman do stand up
At attention
Now they say of the blossom in all of the town
That she takes off her garter and starts on the tug
That dolly who keeps her ain't horrible now
While I'll take the landlord's daughter
Oh, nothing can delight so
- As does the part that lies between
- Her left toe
And her right toe
- I'd like my supper now, please.
- It won't be long, Sergeant.
Oh, you don't want to let them worry you.
Why don't you have a wee drink?
No, thank you, not just now.
I think you all ought to know that
I am here on official business.
I am here to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, as doubtless, the harbour master has already told you by now.
There's the girl.
Her name is Rowan Morrison.
Would you pass that among your customers, please?
Now, if any of you can give me any idea as to her whereabouts,
I'd be most grateful if you'd let me know.
No, I'm afraid nobody's seen her, Sergeant.
Thank you. These Harvest
Festival photographs?
Aye. We have one taken at the end of every summer.
- What happened to last year's?
- Mm, it got broke.
Your supper's ready, Sergeant.
Willow, show the Sergeant to the dining room.
Thank you.
It's disgusting.
- Thank you.
- What's the matter, aren't you hungry?
Aye, it's just that most of the food I've had- the farmhouse soup, the potatoes, broad beans- all come out of a can.
Broad beans, in their natural state, aren't usually turquoise, are they?
- Hmm.
Some things in their natural state have the most vivid colors.
I just wanted to know why, that's all.
Now, I wonder what you'll be wanting for afters?
- Hmm, I'll have an apple.
- No apples.
No apples? On Summerisle?
I expect they've all been exported.
You can have peaches and cream, if you like.
Aye, from a can, I suppose.
All right.
Cheer up. Food isn't everything in life, you know.
Up, up, up, up!
Up, up, up, up, up, up!
- Where?
You'll find it at the top of the stair on your right.
I put my hand
On her knee
And she says
Do you want to see
I put my hand
- Willow Macgreagor.
On her breast
And she says
Do you want a kiss
Willow Macgreagor, I have the honor to present to you Ash Buchanan.
Gently, Johnny
- Come up, Ash Buchanan.
Gently, Johnny my jingaloe another sacrifice for Aphrodite, Willow.
You flatter me, your lordship.
Surely you mean,"to aphrodite."
I make no such distinction.
You are the goddess of love in human form, and I am merely your humble acolyte.
Enjoy yourself, and him.
Only make sure you are ready, for tomorrow is tomorrow.
The day of death and rebirth.
Yes.
And of a somewhat more serious offering... than tonight.
I put my hand
On her thigh
And she says
Do you want to try
I put my hand
On her belly
And she says
Do you want to fill me
Gently, gently
Gently, Johnny
My jingaloe
Gently, gently
Gently, Johnny
My jingaloe
I think I could turn and live with animals.
They are so placid and self-contained.
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins.
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God.
Not one of them kneels to another or to his own kind that lived thousands of years ago.
Not one of them is... respectable
Gently, gently
- or unhappy
Gently, Johnny all over the earth.
Gently, Johnny my jingaloe
Gently, gently
Gently, Johnny
My jingaloe
Good morning,
Sergeant.
- Morning.
- Isn't it glorious?
Aye, aye, it's very nice.
I expect you'll be going home tonight.
Well, that depends.
- Where's the school, please?
- On the far side of the green.
Thank you.
In the woods there grew a tree
And a fine, fine tree was he
And on that tree there was a limb
And on that limb there was a branch
And on that branch there was a nest
And in that nest there was an egg
And in that egg there was a bird
And from that bird a feather came
And of that feather was
A bed
And on that bed there was a girl
And on that girl there was a man
And from that man there was a seed
And from that seed there was a boy
And from that boy there was a man
And for that man there was a grave
And from that grave there grew
A tree
And on that bed there was a girl
And on that girl there was a man
And from that man there was a seed, and from that seed there was a boy
And from that boy there was a man
And for that man there was a grave
And from that grave there grew
A tree
And on that tree there was a limb and on that limb
There was a branch and on that branch there was a nest
And in that nest there was an egg
And in that egg there was a bird, and from that bird, a feather came
And of that feather was
A bed
Very well, girls. That's enough.
Now it's time to pay attention to me.
Now, uh, Daisy, will you tell us what it is, please, that the maypole represents?
Really, Daisy.
- You've been told often enough.
- Miss Rose, I know!
- All right, then, anybody.
- Phallic symbol.
The phallic symbol.
That is correct.
It is the image of the penis, which is venerated in religions such as ours, as simbolising the generative force in nature.
Oh, can I help you?
C- could-could I have a word with you, please, miss?
Certainly. Girls, open your desks and take out your exercise books.
Miss, you can be quite sure that I shall report this to the proper authorities.
Everywhere I go on this island, it seems to me I find degeneracy. and there is brawling in bars, there is indecency in public places, and there is corruption of the young, and now I see it all stems from here- it stems from the filth taught here in this very schoolroom.
I was unaware that the police had any authority in matters of education.
Aye, aye, well, we'll see about that.
Girls, could I have your attention, please?
Now, I am a police officer.
Well, as you can see.
I have come here from the mainland... to investigate the disappearance of a young girl.
I have a photograph here- excuse me- which I would like you to pass around amongst yourselves.
Meanwhile, I'll write her name over there on the blackboard.
Rowan Morrison.
That's her name.
Now, do any of you recognize either the name or the photograph?
- No.
- There's your answer, Sergeant.
If she existed, we would know.
- Whose desk is that?
- No one's.
Thank you.
The little old beetle goes round and round, always the same way, you see, till he ends up right up tight to the nail, poor old thing.
"Poor old thing"?
Then why in God's name do you do it, girl?
I'd like to see the school register, please.
I'm afraid you'll have to have
Lord Summerisle's authority.
This is a police matter.
I'm afraid you'll have to have a search warrant or permission from Lord Summerisle himself.
I'm afraid you'll just have to bear with me, won't you?
You're liars. You are despicable little liars.
Rowan Morrison is a schoolmate of yours, isn't she?
And that is her desk, isn't it?
- Well, isn't it?
- I think you ought to know-
And you are the biggest liar of all.
I warn you, one more lie out of you, and I will charge you with obstruction, and, believe me, Miss Rose, that is a promise.
Now, for the last time, where is Rowan Morrison?
I would like to speak to you outside, Sergeant.
Girls, get on with your reading.
It's the Rites and Rituals of May Day, chapter five. I won't be long.
Well?
You don't understand, Sergeant.
Nobody was lying. I told you plainly.
If Rowan Morrison existed, we would know of her.
You mean, she doesn't exist?
She's dead?
You would say so.
Oh, come on, come on.
She's either dead, or she's not dead.
Here, we do not use the word-
We believe... that when the human life is over, the soul returns to trees, to air, to fire, to water, to animals, so that Rowan Morrison has simply returned... to the life forces in another form.
Do you mean to say you teach the children this stuff?
Yes. I told you, it is what we believe.
They never learn anything of christianity?
Only as a comparative religion.
The children find it far easier to picture... reincarnation than resurrection.
Those rotting bodies are a great stumbling block for the childish imagination.
Why, of course.
And may I ask, where is the rotting body of Rowan Morrison?
Right where you'd expect it to be- in the earth.
You mean, in the churchyard?
- In a manner of speaking.
- No.
In plain speaking.
The building attached to the ground in which the body lies... is no longer used for christian worship, so whether it is still a churchyard is debatable.
But forgive me. I must get back to my girls.
Good morning to you.
"Here lieth Beech Buchanan, protected by the ejaculation of serpents. "
- Morning.
- Morning.
I see you plant trees on most of the graves here.
- Aye, that's right.
- What tree is that?
That's a rowan.
- And who lies there?
- Rowan Morrison.
- How long has she been dead?
- Oh, six or seven months.
They're just a wee bit late with the headstone.
What on earth's that?
It looks like a piece of skin.
- Why, so it is.
- Well, what is it?
The poor wee lassie's navel string, of course.
Where else should it be but hung on her own little tree?
Where does your minister live?
Minister?
Minister.
Oh, what a silly girl you are to make all this fuss.
It's just a little frog.
It'll do that poor sore throat good.
Now, anyone would think you didn't want to get better.
Now, in he goes.
And out he comes. There. Now, that didn't hurt much, did it?
- It tasted horrid.
- Never mind, darling. It's all over now.
Here's your sweet for being a brave girl.
Come on. Which one would you like?
There. He's got your horrid old sore throat now, hasn't he, poor creature?
Can't you hear him croaking?
Can I do anything for you, Sergeant?
I doubt it, seeing you're all raving mad.
Doctor, tell me, did you sign Rowan
Morrison's death certificate?
Uh, Rowan Morrison.
Yes, I did. Why?
Could I see it, please?
You, of all people, should know that death certificates are kept in the public records office.
Now, if you will excuse me.
Doctor.
Tell me, how did Rowan Morrison die?
She was burnt to death, as my lunch will be if I continue talking to you.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- I'd like to see your index of deaths, please.
- Do you have authority?
- No, I meant from his lordship.
- I don't need it.
I'm afraid you have to get permission from Lord Summerisle.
Miss, if you don't cooperate with me here and now, you may well find yourself inside a police cell on the mainland tonight.
Have I made myself quite clear?
Please.
Thank you.
"M."
"m," "m," "m," "m. "
"Benjamin and Rachel
Morrison. "
- Rachel and Benjamin- names from the Bible.
- Yes.
They were very old.
But, there's no record of Rowan Morrison's death, which means, of course, there is no death certificate.
- Did you know her?
- Yes, of course.
- Is that her?
- Yes, that's her.
How did she die?
- I don't know.
- I don't know anything about her. Nothing.
Thank you.
Are you mr. Lennox, the photographer?
Oh, I'm firstly a chemist, secondly a photographer.
I understand that you take the harvest festival photographs every year- the ones I saw in The Green Man.
Yes, it's rather humdrum work,
I'm afraid.
Do you know what happened to last year's photograph?
Isn't it with the others?
No, no, it's not. No, apparently it's been broken or damaged in some way.
- Oh, what a pity.
- Would you have a copy of it?
Oh, no, I don't keep copies.
Mr. Lennox, you were among the people to whom I showed the photograph in the Green Man.
Is that the girl?
- It's difficult to say.
- Oh, come on, man!
It was only eight months ago. Surely you remember if it was that girl or not.
Thank you.
Corn rigs and barley rigs
And corn rigs are bonnie
I'll not forget that happy night
Among the rigs with Annie
Take the flame inside you burn and burn below
Fire seed and fire feed and make the baby grow
Take the flame inside you
Burn and burn belay
Fire seed and fire feed and make the baby stay
Take the flame inside you burn and burn belong
Fire seed and fire feed and make the baby strong
Take the flame inside you burn and burn belie
Fire seed and fire feed and make the baby cry
Take the flame inside you burn and burn begin
Fire seed and fire feed and make the baby king
- His lordship is expecting you, sir.
- Expecting me?
That's what his lordship told me, sir.
Would you please come this way?
In there, sir.
Good afternoon,
Sergeant Howie.
I trust the sight of the young people refreshes you.
No, sir, it does not refresh me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
One should always be open to the regenerative influences.
- I understand you're looking for a missing girl.
- I've found her.
- Splendid.
- In her grave.
Your lordship is a justice of the peace.
I need your permission to exhume her body, have it transported to the mainland for a pathologist's report.
You suspect... foul play?
I suspect murder and conspiracy to murder.
In that case, you must go ahead.
Your lordship seems strangely unconcerned.
I'm confident your suspicions are wrong, Sergeant.
We don't commit murder up here.
We're a deeply religious people.
Religious!
With ruined churches, no ministers, no priests... and children dancing naked.
They do love their divinity lessons.
But they-they are-are naked.
Naturally. It's much too dangerous to jump through the fire with your clothes on.
What-what religion can-can-can they possibly be learning... j- jumping over bonfires?
Parthenogenesis.
What?
Literally, as Miss Rose would doubtless say in her assiduous way, reproduction without sexual union.
Oh, what is all this?
I mean, you-you-you've got fake-fake-fake biology, fake religion.
Sir, have these children never heard of Jesus?
Himself the son of a virgin, impregnated,
I believe, by a ghost.
Do sit down, Sergeant.
Shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent.
Please.
Now, those children out there, they're jumping through the flames in the hope that the god of fire will make them fruitful.
Really, you can hardly blame them.
After all, what girl would not prefer the child of a god to that of some acne-scarred artisan?
- And you, you encourage them in this?
- Actively.
It's most important that each new generation born on Summerisle be made aware that here the old gods aren't dead.
But what of the true god... to whose glory churches and monasteries have been built on these islands for generations past?
Now sir, what of him?
He's dead.
He can't complain.
He had his chance, and in the modern parlance, he blew it.
- What?
- It's very simple.
Let me show you.
In the last century, the islanders were starving.
Like our neighbors today, they were scratching a bare subsistence from sheep and sea.
Then in 1868, my grandfather bought this barren island and began to change things.
A distinguished victorian scientist, agronomist, free thinker.
How formidably benevolent he seems.
Essentially the face of a man incredulous of all human good.
You are very cynical, my lord.
What attracted my grandfather to the island, apart from the profuse source of wiry labor that it promised, was the unique combination of volcanic soil and the warm gulf stream that surrounded it.
You see, his experiments had led him to believe that it was possible to induce here the successful growth of certain new strains of fruit that he had developed.
So, with typical mid-victorian zeal, he set to work.
The best way of accomplishing this, so it seemed to him, was to rouse the people from their apathy... by giving them back their joyous old gods, and as a result of this worship, the barren island would burgeon and bring forth fruit in great abundance.
What he did, of course, was to develop new cultivars of hardy fruits suited to local conditions.
But, of course, to begin with, they worked for him because he fed them and clothed them, but then later when the trees starting fruiting, it became a very different matter, and the ministers fled the island, never to return.
What my grandfather had started out of expediency,
My father continued out of... Love.
He brought me up the same way - to reverence the music and the drama and rituals of the old gods.
To love nature and to fear it, and to rely on it and to appease it where necessary.
- He brought me up -
- He brought you up to be a pagan!
A heathen, conceivably, but not,
I hope, an unenlightened one.
Lord Summerisle, I am interested in one thing: the law.
But I must remind you, sir, that despite everything you've said, you are the subject of a christian country.
Now, sir, if I may have your permission to exhume the body of Rowan Morrison.
I was under the impression I'd already given it to you.
Ah, there's your transport.
It's been a great pleasure meeting a christian copper.
There was a tinker lived of late
Who walked the streets of Rhine.
He bore his pack, upon his back
Watches and plugs did cry
Oh, I have brass within my bag
My hammer's full of metal,
And as to skill I work in clouts
And mend a broken kettle.
A maiden did this tinker meet
And to him boldly say: "Oh, sure
My kettle hath much need
If you will pass my way. "
She took the tinker by the hand
And led him to her door.
Says she "My kettle I will show,
And you can clout it sure.
For patching and plugging is his delight
I found that in Rowan Morrison's grave.
- Little Rowan loved the march hares.
- Hmm.
It's sacrilege.
Only if the ground is consecrated to the christian belief.
Personally, I think it makes a very lovely transmutation.
I'm sure Rowan is most happy with it.
Do you not think so, Lord Summerisle?
Miss, I hope you don't think that I can be made a fool of indefinitely.
Where is Rowan Morrison?
Why, here she is - what remains of her physically.
Her soul, of course, may even now -
Lord Summerisle, where is Rowan Morrison?
Sergeant Howie, I think that... you are supposed to be the detective here.
A child is reported missing on your island.
At first I'm told there is no such child.
I- I then - I then find that there is, in fact, but that she has been killed.
I subsequently discover that there is no death certificate. and now I find that there is a grave.
There's no body.
Very perplexing for you.
What do you think could have happened?
I think Rowan Morrison was murdered... under circumstances of pagan barbarity, which I can scarcely bring myself to believe... as taking place in the 20th century.
Now, it is my intention tomorrow to return to the mainland... and report my suspicions to the Chief Constable of the West Highland Constabulary.
And I will demand a full inquiry takes place into the affairs of this heathen island.
You must, of course, do as you see fit, Sergeant.
Perhaps it's just as well that you won't be here tomorrow, to be offended by the sight of our
May Day celebrations here.
Broome, would you kindly show the Sergeant out?
- This way, sir.
- Good-bye.
Fair maid, says he, your kettle's cracked the cause is plainly told
There hath so many nails been drove mine own could not take hold...
There's hardly any produce.
Well, that's it - the crops failed.
And it's Rowan! Rowan and the crops failed!
Now, what does the old religion say about crop failure?
...to reverence the music, the drama, the rituals of the old gods, to love nature and to fear it, to rely upon it and to appease it when necessary.
Sacrifice.
Perhaps it's just as well that you won't be here... to be offended by the sight of our
May Day celebrations tomorrow.
What if she's not dead?
What if Rowan's not dead?
Sergeant.
Heigh ho
Who is there
No one but me
My dear
Please
Come
Say how do
The things
I'll give to you
A stroke as gentle
As a feather

Together
Heigh ho

Am I not young
And fair
Please
Come
Say how do
The things
I'll show to you
Would you have

How a maid can milk a bull
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
And every stroke
A bucket full
We carry death out of the village!
We carry death out of the village!
"May Day festivals.
"Primitive man lived and died by his harvest.
"The purpose of his spring ceremonies was to ensure a plentiful autumn.
"Relics of these fertility dramas are to be found all over Europe.
"In Great Britain, for example, one can still see...
"harmless versions of them danced in obscure villages on May Day.
"Their cast includes many alarming characters:
"A man-animal, or hobbyhorse,
"who canters at the head of the procession charging at the girls;
"A man-woman, the sinister teaser,
"played by the community leader or priest;
"And a man-fool, Punch,
"most complex of all the symbolic figures -
"the privileged simpleton and king for a day.
"Six swordsmen follow these figures...
"and at the climax of the ceremony lock their swords together...
"In a clear symbol of the Sun.
"In pagan times, however, these dances were not simply picturesque jigs.
"They were frenzied rites ending in a sacrifice
"by which the dancers hoped desperately to win over the goddess of the fields.
"In good times, they offered produce to the gods and slaughtered animals,
"but in bad years, when the harvest had been poor,
"the sacrifice was a human being.
"In some cultures, it would be the king himself.
"In others, the most beloved virgin.
"Very often he or she would be kept hidden for months preceding the ceremony,
"just as the Sun is hidden from the Earth in winter.
Rowan's not dead!
"Methods of sacrifice differed.
"Sometimes the victim would be drowned in the sea...
"or burnt to death in a huge sacrificial bonfire.
Sometimes the six swordsmen ritually beheaded the virgin. "
Dear God in Heaven, even these people can't be that mad.
"The chief priest then skinned the child,
"and wearing the still-warmed skin like a mantle,
"led the rejoicing crowds through the streets.
"The priest thus represented the goddess reborn and guaranteed another successful harvest next year. "
Good morning, Sergeant!
I need to get to my plane.
Oh, well, on May Day,
I'd better take you out myself.
That's it.
Here, right.
I shall be back shortly with some more police officers.
Have a good flight then!
Hey, you come back here!
I said, come back here!
What's the matter? Won't she go?
No. Has anyone been here?
Not to my knowledge, Sergeant.
If any of the children had been interfering with it, I'm sure I would have seen-
I warn you: you're obstructing a police officer.
I am not obstructing you, Sergeant.
You could maybe get old Sam there to row you to the mainland.
You'd be back in a week.
Well, I'll just have to find Rowan Morrison myself.
- Everything under control, Oak?
- Aye, my lord.
Mr. Macgreagor, I trust we aren't going to have to let out your costume again this year.
I think I'll manage, my lord, but it does seem to shrink a little each year.
I know.
My friends, enough now.
We shall all reassemble outside the town hall at 3:00 sharp... and then process through the village and the countryside, down to the beach below the stones, by the route which has become sacred to our rite.
This year at the procession's end, as has already been proclaimed, a holy sacrifice will be offered up jointly to Nuada, our most sacred god of the Sun, and to Avellenau, the beloved goddess of our orchards, in order that we may furnish them with renewed power... to quicken the growth of our crops.
- Hail the Queen of the May!
- Hail the Queen of the May!
Hail the Queen of the May!
Why, Sergeant, I thought you'd gone back.
Mrs. Morrison, I don't know if you know it or not,
But Rowan is not dead.
- They've got her hidden somewhere.
- They?
Now, if you know where she is, I beg you to tell me now before it's too late.
- Sergeant, I've already told you -
- In the name of God, woman, what kind of mother are you, that can stand by and see your own child slaughtered?
Sergeant, if I were you, I would go back to the mainland.
Stop interfering in things that are no concern of yours.
I am going to search every house in this place during the next few hours. and if anybody, including you, stands in my way, they'll be arrested as accomplices to murder.
You'll simply never understand the true nature of sacrifice.
Heathens! Bloody heathens!
Yes?
- Take those masks off.
- No.
Take them off!
- What do you think you're doing?
- Searching every house... for a missing child.
Baa baa black sheep,
Have you any wool
Yes, sir, yes, sir,
Three bags full
I- I'm sorry.
- What's that?
- The life of the fields.
John Barleycorn.
What's in here?
- What's that?
- That's my costume - the salmon of knowledge.
Hello. You're back early.
Where are the other coppers?
There aren't any. The plane wouldn't start.
Give me a glass of whiskey, please.
So he spent his time instead turning the whole village upside down.
- Just give me a glass of whiskey.
- No wonder he's worn out.
Did you find the girl?
No, well, I can't say I'm very surprised.
I'm going to rest in my bed for half an hour.
I do not wish to be disturbed.
I'd stay there until tonight, if I was you.
We don't much relish strangers around today.
He's asleep.
I don't like to use it on him, really.
The laird said we're to take no chances, didn't he?
I know, but with the Hand of Glory there's no telling when you wake.
He might sleep for days.
- All the better.
- Shh!
- We don't want him butting in. Go on, light it up.
That will make you sleep, my pretty Sergeant.
I'm away to change.
We can't do without Punch.
You best get on ahead.
They've given you girls five minutes start, haven't they?
Good-bye.
What's the matter with you, Macgreagor?
Do you call that dancing?
Cut some capers, man. Use your bladder.
Play the fool. That's what you're here for.
I suppose you've been getting drunk at your own bar.
That's more like it!
Good, good!
Here comes the job, that you chop off your head!
Chop, chop, chop, chop.
Chop, chop, chop, chop.
Everyone must go through, Macgreagor.
It's a game of chance, remember.
It's Holly. Well done.
Now, my friends, to the beach.
O god of the sea,
I offer you this ale as a libation, that you may bestow upon us in the year to come the rich and diverse fruits of your kingdom.
Hail, god of the seas!
Accept our offering!
And now, for our more dreadful sacrifice... yo those who command the fruit of the Earth.
It's Rowan.
What's the matter, Mr. Macgreagor?
Now, don't be frightened. I'm a police officer.
- I've got to try and get you away.
- Hurry, mister, please.
- I don't like it here. They're coming.
Do you know what they're gonna do?
- They're going to -
- Come on, come on. Hurry, hurry!
We can escape through the cave. I know the way.
Quickly.
That's the way out up there.
Come on. It's through a big tunnel.
We seem to have lost our torch-bearing friends.
I'm sorry.
It was worse than I remembered it.
- Did I do it right?
- You did it beautifully.
Dear little Rowan.
Rowan, darling. Come on, now.
Welcome, fool.
You have come of your own free will to the appointed place.
The game is over.
Game? What game?
The game of the hunted leading the hunter.
You came here to find Rowan Morrison, but it is we who have found you and brought you here and controlled your every thought and action since you arrived.
Principally, we persuaded you to think that Rowan Morrison was being held as a sacrifice because our crops failed last year.
I know your crops failed.
I saw the harvest photograph.
Oh, yes. They failed, all right, disastrously so... for the first time since my grandfather came here.
The blossom came but the fruit withered and died on the bough.
That must not happen again this year.
It is our most earnest belief that the best way of preventing this is to offer to our god of the Sun and to the goddess of our orchards the most acceptable sacrifice that lies in our power.
Animals are fine, but their acceptability is limited.
A little child is even better, but not nearly as effective as the right kind of adult.
What do you mean,
"right kind of adult"?
You, Sergeant, are the right kind of adult, as our painstaking researches have revealed.
You, uniquely, were the one we needed.
A man who would come here of his own free will.
A man who has come here with the power of a king by representing the law.
A man who would come here as a virgin.
A man who has come here as a fool.
Get out of my way.
You are the fool, Mr. Howie -
Punch, one of the great fool-victims of history, for you have accepted the role of king for a day, and who but a fool would do that?
But you will be revered and anointed as a king.
You will undergo death and rebirth - resurrection, if you like.
The rebirth, sadly, will not be yours, but that of our crops.
I am a christian, and as a Christian, I hope for resurrection.
And even if you kill me now, it is I who will live again, not your damned apples.
Sleep
Close and fast
No matter what you do, you can't change the fact that I believe in the life eternal, as promised to us by our lord, Jesus Christ.
I believe in the life eternal as promised to us by our lord, Jesus Christ.
That is good.
For believing what you do, we confer upon you a rare gift these days - a martyr's death.
You will not only have life eternal, but you will sit with the saints among the elect.
Come.
It is time to keep your appointment with The Wicker Man.
Now, wait!
Now, all of you, just wait and listen to me.
And you can wrap it up any way you like.
You are about to commit murder.
Can you not see? There is no Sun god.
There is no goddess of the fields.
Your crops failed because your strains failed.
Fruit is not meant to be grown on these islands.
It's against nature.
Don't you see that killing me is not going to bring back your apples?
Summerisle, you know it won't.
Go on, man. Tell them. Tell them it won't.
I know it will.
Well, don't you understand that if your crops fail this year, next year you're going to have to have another blood sacrifice?
And next year, no one less than the king of Summerisle himself will do.
If the crops fail, Summerisle, next year your people will kill you on May Day.
They will not fail.
The sacrifice of the willing king, like virgin fool, will be accepted.
But don't you see I'll be missed?
- They'll come looking for me.
- There will be no traces. Bring him up, Oak.
- Go on.
- No!
Think! Just think what you're doing!
Think what you're doing! Think!
In the name of God, think what you're doing!
Oh, God! Oh, Jesus Christ!
Oh, my God! Christ!
No, no, dear God!
No, Christ!
No, no!
Mighty god of the Sun, bountiful goddess of our orchards, accept our sacrifice and make our blossoms fruit.
Mighty god of the Sun, bountiful goddess of our orchards...
- Hear ye the words of the lord!
...accept our sacrifice and make our blossoms fruit.
Awake, ye heathens, and hold!
It is the Lord who hath laid waste your orchards!
It is he who hath made them bare!
- Reverence the sacrifice.
Hold, ye husbandmen, because the harvest of your field hath perished and the vine is dried up and the apple tree languisheth!
Even all the trees of the field are withered because the truth is withered away from the sons of men.
Desire shall fail and ye shall all die accursed!
Summer is a-comin' in
Loudly sing cuckoo
Grows the seed and blows the mead
And springs the wood anew
Sing cuckoo
Ewe bleats harshly after lamb
Cows after calves make moo
The lord's my shepherd
I'll not want
He takes me down to lie in pastures -
Oh, God.
Grows the seed and blows the mead
And springs the wood anew
- Sing cuckoo
- Oh, God.
I humbly entreat you for the soul of this, thy servant, Neil Howie... who will today depart from this world.
Do not deliver me into the enemy's hands... or put me out of mind forever.
Let me not undergo the real pains of hell, dear God, because I die unshriven
- Cuckoo, cuckoo
- and establish me in that bliss which knows no ending,
- Cuckoo
- through Christ, our lord.
Grows the seed and blows the mead
Failure! Failure!
Sing cuckoo
Ewe bleats harshly after lamb
Cows after calves make moo
Bullock stamps and deer champs
Now shrilly sing cuckoo
Cuckoo, cuckoo
Wild bird are you
Be never still, cuckoo

What time is it, Rodney?

Hmm.
I'm sick of 6:00.
Sir?
Why isn't it 7:00 or even 8:00?
Well, it was just 5:00 recently, sir, and 6:00 does precede 7:00 and 8:00.
I'm sure there's a logic to that somewhere, but it's just too tiring to think about.
Yes, sir.

Haven't seen you in a long time.
Such a child.
What a lovely little tie.
Is it a boy or girl?
A girl? You should dress her differently. Harold.
Yeah. Such a doll.
Look at her eyes.
Yeah, a little doll.
Harold.
Give me the children.
Harold! Oh.
Oh, Harold, turn that off.
Oh, would that I could, ma'am.
Oh, it's the sun.
The sun it is.
Give me the sun, Mother.
Aren't we looking pretty today?
Thank you.

Ah, some refreshment and a conveyance. Yes.
You're in my way.
You wanna get killed?
Ooh, there's one. Taxi.
You're sure you wouldn't like to get back in now, sir?
Oh, I think I look rather striking out here.
What?
Striking.
Yes, I know, but-What? Uh-oh.
Taxi!
[ Tires Screeching ]
Gracious, you're heavy.
I'm awfully sorry.
What the hell were you doing, anyway, hanging onto that taxi?
Are you all right, Miss O'Kelly?
Oh, it sobered me up anyhow.
Mr. Pritchard, are you hurt?
No. I landed on something soft.
Hmm. I like you. Thank you. Would you like to have a drink on that?
Sir, I'm afraid the car isn't so fit.
Oh, really?
[ Coughing ]
What's the matter?
I don't smoke.
She doesn't smoke.
She doesn't smoke.
I knew that.
Now, who's this?
Rodney James.
He used to drive for me.
Very funny.
Hello, Rodney.
A pleasure.
He's very formal.
Yes. He tries to compensate for me.
What's your name?
Kitty O'Kelly.
I don't believe that.
Well, I know what you mean.
But the real one's
Kathy Krumm with a "K."
How would that look in lights?
[ Together ]
Crummy with a
[ Both Laughing ]
What would you be doing in lights anyway?
I'm a singer.
Oh.
What do you do?
Nothing. I'm an heir.
What?
Well, that's not a taxi.
Nope.
That's your car.
Yep.
Look what I did to it. That's all right.
I got a couple of others.
You do?
Mm-hmm.
What kind? Just like this one.
I can't tell 'em apart.
I like you more and more.
Thank you.
Is that why you call this one
MOP III?
No, actually, that's me.
You're the third MOP?
Yeah.
You ever get bored?
Never.
Rodney.
Sir!

Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Hurry up! It's starting.
I hope we miss it.
Oh, will you stop badgering me?
I'm not badgering you.
We're lost.
I'm making sense.
Oh, where do we Beth, bet?
What'd you have in mind, honey?
[ Together ] "Beth, bet"? What?
Beat it, Morris.
You ain't cute.
Oh, yeah? Well, dames don't belong down here no way. Come, snooks.
Aw, go suck an egg.
I can't see a thing.
I wish you'd wear your glasses.
Where are we going?
Straight ahead.
Oh!
Bettin' our last $300 is no way to make ends meet. I always win at games.
They probably won't take our bet anyway.
They'd better.
They don't know us. Unless you'd rather sleep in the park tonight.
They have to know you.
That's ridiculous.
[ Track Announcer On P.A. ]
The horses are approaching the gate.
Stand here.
Is this the line?
You don't know nothin' about betting or racing-Oh, stop crabbing!
Crab, crab, crab.
I'm not crabbing.
Tell them to hurry up.
I'm not crabbing.
Tell them to hurry up.
No.
Hmm!
[ Gruffly ] Yes?
Yes.
[ Giggles ]
I'm in an awful hurry.
May I get ahead of you?
For you, anything.
Thank you.
Except this.
Except what?
Yes? I'm betting also on this race.
I don't like to miss my chance.
I have lucky feeling today.
You're Italian. Mmm.
Venetian.
Every Italian I've ever met is rude, inconsiderate and selfish. Brooke.
Perhaps because they are not used to women who are spoiled.
Yeah, in Italy, we don't have.
Elizabeth, call the police.
They don't come around where there's betting, honey. It ain't legal.
[ Man ] Hey, Spanish. They're at the gate. What'll it be?
1,000. Ladies' Day to win.
I hope you lose.
Spanish. 1,000.
Grazie. Ciao.
[ Track Announcer ] The flag is up.
What did he say?
What are you girls doing here?
We were drawn by your magnetism.
Uh-huh. Now don't be rude to the man, Elizabeth.
Which one, sir, do you think will win?
I ain't a seer, lady.
What? He says he ain't a seer.
And he certainly ain't no "sir."
Mmm, tough cookie, huh?
You wanna start somethin'?
How about Cot-ton Ball?
Cotton Ball. That's a nice name.
Pays 20-to-1.
I'll take it.
Put that away. You want to get us all locked up?
It's real.
Put that away!
Look. $300.
No cash. No cash.
Look, kid, I can't take your bet nohow.
I don't know ya.
I'm Brooke Carter. Oh, nice to meet ya.
So long.
Beth.
[ Groans ]
You better take her bet, wise guy, if you know what's good for you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
This is... Sleep Out Louie's dame.
Carter?
That's right.
That's right.
Carter. 300. Cotton Ball.
You wanna put it on his nose?
Yeah, yeah.
What?
Are you sure you don't wanna try Ladies' Day, honey?
Valentino looked awful positive.
You mean positively awful.
[ Bell Rings ]
That's it, girls.

They're off and running!
Who is Sleep Out Louie?
Beats me.
- At the start, it's Chuck-a-luck. Blue Boy in second.

Jumper is third.
Ladies' Day is drawing up.
Pumpkin Pie and Texas Moon.
It's Chuck-a-luck with the lead.
Blue Boy moving up to second.
They're going into the first turn.
It's Chuck-a-luck in front by a length.
Blue Boy is second.
Jumper is third.
Ladies' Day moving up to fourth.
Pumpkin Pie, Texas Moon and, at the rear, it's Cotton Ball.
[ Mimicking ] Oh, that Cotton Ball.
That's a nice name.
You bet on Cotton Ball?
We certain-We certainly did, and he's going to win.
[ Mocking Laugh ]
Chuck-a-luck in front by two lengths.
Blue Boy is second.
And Ladies' Day is now moving up fast on the inside.
Pumpkin Pie, and here comes Cotton Ball.
Where? Where?
Right there.
Going into the far turn, it's Chuck-a-luck in front.
We hate you. Come on, Cotton Ball!
Move it!
And Ladies' Day is moving up very fast on the outside.
Turning into the stretch, it's Chuck-a-luck and Ladies' Day.
They're neck and neck.
Come on, Chuck-amen!
No, it's Ladies' Day.
I'm sure.
It's Chuck-a-luck and Ladies' Day!
And Ladies' Day moves ahead.
It's Ladies' Day by a head!
The winner!
Chuck-a-luck was second.
Pumpkin Pie was fourth.
Jumper was fifth.
Blue Boy in sixth.
And here comes Cotton Ball.
Oh, look at him.
Well, good-bye, ladies.
Tomorrow, everything will be better.

Well, at least we know who Sleep Out Louie is.
Who?
Nobody.
Mmm.
Come on, snooks.
We have just enough change for the subway.
Never been on the subway.
Oh, you'll love it.
[ Track Announcer ]
Well, folks, there's Cotton Ball.
Guess he was hungry.
Come on, cheer up.
Something will come up.
Maybe we'll hear from your mother.
Fat chance.
Yeah, well, I keep telling you you gotta be more polite to folks. Hmm.
That guy was probably some rich Italian count or something.
Would've been a lot smarter than bettin' on Cotton Ball, being nice to him.
That's a revolting thought.
Yeah?
Yeah.
- [ Horn Honks ]
- Well, listen...
Buongiorno!
[ Scoffing ]
Okay, watch me.
You are hitching hike?
Hmm?
Hitching hike.
Oh, of course. We always hitching hike after we lose.
Sort of a penance.
[ Chuckling ] Ah.
And what do strong, handsome
Venetians do when they win?
Whatever the ladies desire.

The subway. The subway.
Well, how about a little hitch for two sore losers?
No, just one.
I gotta see a man about a dog.

But lately, it hasn't been so often.
In fact, we haven't heard from her in three months... except for one postcard from Rio that just said, "Ole! Love, Mother."
But then you must need some money.

Oh, come on, Rod. You've only had one.
Yeah, Rod.
That is not my name.
I am simply not a "Rod."
Thank heaven.
Open wide.
Whoo.
[music] If you ever lose your mind,
I'll be kind [music]
Isn't he sweet? [ Brooke ] Yes.
[music] If you ever lose your shirt,
I'd be hurt [music]
There's a switch.
[music] If you're ever in a mill and get sawed in half, I won't laugh [music]
[music] It's friendship, friendship [music]

[ Door Opens ]
Ah, Rodney.
Is she safe?
Sir?
Did she get home safe? I thought she was with you, sir.
Who?
Miss Carter.
No Miss Carter.
Little Annie Orphan.
You mean the figure in the comic?
Of course. She has been trying to return to her Daddy Warbucks for three weeks.
He is not her real daddy because she is orphan.
She has no mama, no daddy.
She has no eyes either.
Yeah. It's a symbol.
Ah. Well, sir, I haven't had a look yet.
Why don't you look for yourself?
Oh, grazie, grazie. Is there anything else you'd like?
Oh, no. Grazie.
Thank you. It's enough.
Whatever you say, sir.
Leaping lizards!
Sir?
Leaping lizards.
She always says "Leaping lizards."
How eloquent.
See, ma, she no home.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah, tomorrow.
I shall say a small prayer.
Thank you!
You are very gentle.
Thank you, sir.

What?
Oh, never mind.
Don't just stand there.
You look like a nervous turtle.
Another reptile.
Huh?
How does one tell, I wonder, when turtles are nervous?
Well, they stay in their shells,
Rodney ol' James.
Well, that is not the case with this turtle. No, huh?
No, he was simply amazed that anyone who could swill so much liquor of an evening... could possibly arise so early in the morning.
I love the way you talk.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Coffee's hot.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Those for Miss Carter?
Yep.
An eccentric breakfast,
I dare say.
Oh, she don't eat 'em.
She don't-uh, doesn't?
Nope.
Well, what does she do with them?
She puts 'em on her face.
I see. Silly of me to ask.
I made some fresh orange juice in the icebox, if you want it.
No, thank you.
I don't believe I'll eat or drink for several days.
What do you all do around here to pass the time?
[ Cucumber Crunches ]
Oh, many things.
Like?
Well, there are several splendid horses in the stable.
A large pool, a tennis court, a skeet range.
Mr. Pritchard also plays poker, football...
Oh, I love football.
All that contact.
Madam, please, keep your distance.
I was just gonna get some orange juice for Miss Brooke.
I'm sorry.
You're an old grouch.
That's true.
You can put the coffee down now.
[ Loud Slam ]
Isn't there anything you like to do?
Yes, there is.
What?
Sleep.
I bet you mean sleep too.
Yes, I do.

I think we had better.
[music] Can you do the crawl, my dear?
[music]

What are you yelling about?
Just seeing if you're up, sir.
Have you got my fizzy?

What shall I do with Miss O'Kelly's coffee?
She's gone for a walk or something equally bizarre.
I'll drink it.

That's bad.
It ain't good.
Well, I try.
Well, "boner fortuner."
Oh.
Brooke.
Brooke.
It's me-Johnny.
[ Brooke ]
No kidding.
Brooke, you are angry.
Brooke, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you the truth.
But it's only a little lie.
I become very rich very soon.
Maybe tomorrow.
Okay, okay.
I'll see you later.
Let me wake up now.
Yeah, I go.
Brooke.
What?
Little Annie Orphan no home yet.
Brooke? Did you hear about Little Annie?
Leaping lizards.
Yeah.
I see you later, Mia Cara.
[music] Is it in marble;
[music] Or is it in clay? [music]
[music] Is what I thought a new Rolls [music]

[music] A used Chevrolet? [music]
[music] Is it a sapphire [music]
[music] Or simply a charm? [music]
[music] Is it real fire [music]
Yeah.
[music] Or just a false alarm? [music]
[music] Is it today's thrill;
[music] Or really romance? [music]
[music] Is it a kiss on the lips [music]
[music] Or just a kick in the pants?
[music]
[music] Is it the gay 906$ [music]
[music] Cavorting above? [music]
[music] Or is it [music]
[music] At long last [music]
Love?
Talking to yourself?
Uh, yeah, a little.
Nice day.
Belissima.
Oh, that's Italian. Ah, for the day and for you.

No, huh?
What about Dick Tracy?
Oh, still the same.

[music] Will it be tender and sweet [music]
[music] Or merely massage? [music]
[music] Is it a brainstorm [music]

[music] Or is it the best;

[ Mike ]
Talking to yourself?
I was just thinking about... things.
Anyone I know?
No.
Well, don't go away.
I'm just gonna...
Okay.
Be right down.
[music] Is it an earthquake [music]
[music] Or simply a shock? [music]
[music] Is it the good turtle soup [music]
[music] Or merely the mock? [music]
[music] Is it a cocktail [music]
[music] This feeling of joy? [music]
[music] Or is what I feel [music]
[music] The real McCoy? [music]
[music] Have I the right hunch [music]
[music] Or have I the wrong? [music]
[music] Will it be Bach I shall hear or just a Cole Porter song? [music]
[music] Is it a fancy love [music]

Oh, I'm sorry.
I've got alcohol in my eyes.
Well, that's an original way to drink.
No. Shaving alcohol.
You shouldn't drink that at all. [

Could we continue this conversation later? Gladly.
Thank you. Could I ask you one question before I go?
No.
What's that all over your face?

Why don't you go shave?
I Will.

[music] What can account for [music]
[music] These strange pitter-pats?
[music]
[music] Could this be the dream [music]
[music] The cream, the cats'? [music]
[music] Is it to rescue [music]
[music] Or is it to wreck? [music]
[music] Is it an ache in the heart;
[music] Or just a pain in the neck?
[music]
[music] Is it the ivy you touch [music]
[music] With a glove? [music]
[music] Or is it at long [music]

Huh?
That's okay. That's Mabel.
My mother.
[ Kathy Laughs ]
Touchdown!
I win.
Mother, you're always spoiling it.
[ Grunting ]
I said no tackling.
We're not gonna have any tack...
I hate this game.
I've always hated this game.
Really, Kitty.
You're getting awfully butch.
I don't know what came over me. Not to mention this other young lady.
Hi. I'm Brooke. I'm broken.
My back is broken.
I'm sorry!
He's always complaining.
Michael, if you're going to play with pros, you have to be prepared.
Yes, Mother.
Now, who's this?
I'm Johnny Spanish.
I bet you are.
No, Mabel. That's his name.
I love it!
Now cut that out.
He goes with her.
Lucky me!
Oh, well, if that's your type.
You can have him, Mrs. Pritchard, but he's all show.
Oh, yes.
Call me Mabel, dear. I don't like to be reminded of my husband.
Sure.
Tea, Mrs. P.?
Perfect timing, Rodney.
Where would you like it?
Well, where am I now? I'd say you were in the middle of the backyard.
Well, I think I'll have my tea in the middle of the backyard.
Very good, madam. See how she makes decisions? Just like that.
Who's your playmate?
Oh, that's Elizabeth.
Now, please, madam, don't encourage her.
I'm his shadow.
You see what I mean.
Oh, now, Rodney.
You're blushing.
That's a first.
Is he blushing?
I've seen him blush before.
He's blushing.
You can spare us the sordid details, Michael.
Could we change the subject?
Well, Rodney, you and
Elizabeth run off and play.
We can manage the tea.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, couldn't I stay?
We're never alone.
[ Laughing ]
I know what you mean, dear.
Madam, that is unfair.
Well, Rodney, let's face it.
You are no pushover.
Oh, hear, hear.
Well, all right. Stay.
Have a drink.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[ Thuds ]
Rodney, you're such a tiger.
I see you still haven't shaved that silly thing off.
Do we have to talk about it now?
Don't you like his mustache?
She hates it. He only grew it to look like Rodney.
Well, he's my idol.
He's mine too.
Oh, go away!
[ Laughing ]
I see I'm still the only one currently unattached.
You'll all have to come to the club dance with me tonight, help me pick someone out.
Absolutely out of the question.
[music] [ Slow Tempo ]
Michael.
Hi, Mabel.
Hello, handsome.
Hello, madam.
[ Sighs ]
Your mother looks beautiful tonight. Yes.
Who's that stick she's dancing with?
Captain Craig.
I don't know what he's captain of.
That's what they've always called him.
Maybe it's his first name.
I knew a guy called Sergeant once.
Possible.
[ Shoe Shuffling, Tapping ]
They don't like tip-tap.
They don't like anything.
I think if a bomb fell right outside, they'd just give you that look and go right on dancing.
Oh, of course.
Didn't you know?
Yes? [music] When you're out in smart society;
[music] And you suddenly get bad news [music]
[music] You mustn't show anxiety [music]
No?
[music] And proceed to sing the blues [music] Hmm.
[music] For example, tell me something sad [music]
[music] Something awful
Something grave [music]
[music] And I'll show you how a Racquet Club lad would behave [music]

[music] I feel a sudden urge to sing [music]
Huh?
[music] The kind of ditty that invokes the spring [music]
[music] So control your desire to curse [music]
[music] While I crucify the verse [music]
[music] This verse you've started seems to me [music]
Yeah?
[music] The Tin-Pantithesis of melody [music]
[ Scoffs ]
So spare me, please, the pain.
Just skip the damn thing and sing the refrain.

[music] So please, be sweet, my chickadee [music]
[music] And when I kiss you, just say to me [music]
[music] It's delightful? [music]

I was just... doing the books.
[music] Are you good at figures, dear? [music]
[music] Kindly tell me if so [music]
[music] Yes, I'm good at figures, dear;
[music] But in the morning, no;
[music] Do you do double entry, dear? [music]
[music] Kindly tell me if so [music]
[music] I do double entry, dear;
[music] But in the morning, no, no;

[music] Yes, yes;
[music] No, no, no, no, no;
[ Elizabeth ] Yes. [ Rodney ] Mmm.
[music] We're on the crest
We have no cares [music]
[music] We're just a couple of honey bears [music]
[music] It's delightful
It's delicious [music]
[music] It's de-lovely [music]
[music] All's as right as can be [music]
[music] Till one night at my window I see [music]
[music] An absurd bird with a bundle hung on his nose;
Get baby clothes.
[music] These eyes of mine are filled with joy;
[music] The nurse appears and cries, "It's a boy!" [music]
[music] He's appalling [music]
[music] He's appealing [music]
[music] He's a polliwog [music]
[music] He's a paragon [music]
[music] He's a Popeye. [music] [music]
He's a panic. He's a pip. [music]
It's getting late!
[music] And while I wait, my poor heart aches on [music]
[music] Why keep the brakes on'? [music]
Let's misbehave?
[music] I feel quite sure un peu diamour [music]
[music] Would be attractive [music]
[music] While we're still active [music]
[music] Let's misbehave [music]
[music] You know my heart 'vs true [music]
[music] When you say you for me care [music]
[music] Somebody's sure to tell [music]
[music] But what the hell [music]
[music] Do we care? [music]
[music] They say that bears have love affairs [music]
And even camels.
Mm-hmm.

There you go, Frank.
There you go, Frank.
Yay!
Did you see that?
Of course I saw it.
[ Sighs ]
Didn't take them very long, did it?
Nope. First pitch.
How do you know she pitched?
Huh?
He might have done the pitching.
Remember Casanova? He was Italian too.
Ollie, what are you talking about?
What do you mean what am I talking about? I'm talking about our two friends over there.
Giving the ball game some pretty stiff competition.
Well, good for them.
What's wrong with that?
Johnny's a swell guy, and she's a peach.
I just wish they weren't so angry at us.
You mean you knew that was going on?
Nope. But I'm glad.
You are?
Mm-hmm.
Makes me not feel so bad about stealing her boyfriend.
You're strong, you know that?
Mm-hmm.
All gone.
Hey, that's a good idea.
We'll let them see us.
What?
You're jealous? Oh, don't be absurd.
Me jealous?
You are!
I am not.
You thought she'd be pining away for you.
I certainly didn't have any such thought.
Now just be quiet and watch the ball game.
Hey, Ollie. That reminds me.
What?
Did you hear about the horse that could pitch and field as good as Babe Ruth?
A horse?
It's a joke.
Oh, that's funny.
It's not finished yet.
Oh.
This horse could pitch and field, you see, so the manager asked his trainer...
He said, "Can he bat?"
Oh, that's very funny.
It's not over yet. It's the longest joke I've ever heard.
If you'd be quiet, I could finish it.
Well, go on. Finish it.
All right.
The manager says,
"Can he bat?"
And the trainer answers, "Whoever heard of a horse that can bat?"
Yeah? Go on.
Oh, forget it.

Johnny Spanish-wonderful chap.
And he's in love with you.
That's what he told me.
Mm-hmm.
And Kitty and I-Well, she makes me laugh. [ Mock Laughing ]
Anyway, Johnny and I-Well, we decided to make it up between us.
I hope you're very happy together.
No, seriously.
He's got a big poker game or something over in Staten Island tonight, and this time he's positive his ship is gonna come in.
Mm-hmm. Like the Titanic.
And he's gonna call you tomorrow.
Hmph.
He doesn't hold anything against us.
As a matter of fact, he feels...
Why don't you just come out and say what you mean?
Well, as Dorothy Parker once said to her boyfriend...
[music] Fare thee well [music]
Mm-hmm.
As Columbus announced when he knew he was bounced...
[music] It was swell, Isabelle
Swell [music]
Yeah, but... [music] As Abelard said to Heloise [music]
[music] Don't forget to drop a line to me, please [music]
You mean-[music] As Juliet cried in her Romeo's ear;
[music] "Romeo, why not face the fact, my dear?" [music]
Sure.
[music] It was just one of those things [music]
[music] Just one of those crazy flings [music] Mm-hmm.
[music] One of those bells that now and then ring [music]
Just... one of those things.
That's right.
[music] It was just one of those nights [music]
[music] Just one of those fabulous flights [music]
[music] A trip to the moon on gossamer wings [music]
[music] Just one of those things [music]
Taxi!
[music] If we'd thought a bit about the end of it [music]
Take me home. [music] When we started painting the town [music]
[music] We'd have been aware that our love affair [music]
[music] Was [music]
Too hot... not to cool down.
[music] So good-bye, dear, and amen [music]
[music] Here's hoping we meet now and then [music]
[music] It was great fun [music]
[music] But it was just one [music]
[music] Oi those 'Mugs [music]
I wonder which is which.
Excuse me?
No, I won't.
Now, really, Elizabeth. I don't see why you continue to blame me for the actions of my employer.
After all, it's none of our affair.
You watch your words, junior, unless you want a fat lip.
I didn't mean-I know what you meant.
You know what he meant, don't ya?
[ Squawks ]
Don't exert yourself, Mertle.
She's probably hungry. I'll take care of my bird. Thanks a lot.

"Congralutations."
She says, "Congralutations."
He wants to know if you want to help him spend it.
I'm not here.
[ Glass Clatters ]
She's not here.
Okay. Sorry, Johnny.
Good-bye.
Okay. The show's over, boys.
Beat it.
You look like you ain't et in a week.
Ain't ya hungry?
Huh?
Did you see the paper?
Your pal bought a new horse for Kitty, but Rod says she's not answering her phone neither.
[ Whining, Shouts ]
Yeah, I thought you'd like it.
Well, I got a reaction anyway.
I'm glad to see you ain't blind yet.
Order more champagne.
Oh, come on, honey!
Ain't you had enough?
No guy is worth this.
What guy?
I'm just an "alhocolic."
All right.
[ Bottle Clatters ]
Well, I'll order some more up for you, but first I gotta wash up a little... and feed Mertle.
She's starving.
I'll be right back.

[music] But practically everything [music]
[music] Leaves me totally cold [music]
[music] The only exception I know [music]
[music] Is the case [music]
[music] When I'm out on a quiet spree [music]
[music] Fighting vainly the old ennui [music]
[music] And I suddenly turn and see [music]
[music] Your fabulous [music]
[music] Face [music]
[music] I get no kick from champagne [music]
[music] Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all [music]
[music] So tell me, why should it be true [music]
[music] That I get a kick out of you? [music]
[music] Some get a kick from cocaine [music]
[music] I'm sure that if
I took even one sniff [music]
[music] That would bore me terrifically too [music]
[music] Yet I get a kick out of you [music]
[music] I get a kick every time I see you [music]
[music] Standing there before me [music]
[music] I get a kick though it's clear to me [music]

[music] They just like to kick it around [music]

What?

What is this?
[music] A romp and a quickie [music]

[music] He'll love you forever;
[music] Part from you never [music]

Let's hear it!

[music] I might have had a real romance [music]
[music] If they'd given me a chance [music]
[music] I love him [music]
[music] But he didn't love me [music]
[music] I wanted him [music]
[music] But he didn't want me [music]
[music] Then the gods had a spree [music]
[music] And indulged in another whim [music]
[music] Now he loves me [music]
[music] But I don't love him [music]

[music] To several devoted wives [music]
Really?

[music] You loved him [music]
[music] But he didn't love you [music]
[music] You wanted mm [music]
[music] But he didn't want you [music]
[music] Then the gods saw you two [music]
[music] And indulged in another whim [music]

- God, you know everything.
I need something new.
I got no fucking life, Rudge.
I can't get laid. Nobody wants me.

We all work too hard, don't we?

I'd like to have some time to myself before I kick off.

I'm gonna take a year off.
- You inherit money?
- I can't dredge up sincerity anymore.
- Wrong.
- Don't tell me wrong!
Wrong! I'm fucking running the Green Bay Packers!
- You give me sandlot in Dixie!
- I don't want a year off in a year.
- 29 people work for you.
- I'll be a cadaver soon.
You want out? Okay, leùs call in the dogs and piss on the fire.
I taught you that.
I know you taught me that.

Rose, you're one of the best singer ladies in the world.
Don't fuck it up.
Sweet cheeks.
Sweet cheeks?
Come on.
Sweet cheeks.
- I'm so tired.
- Hey.
Hey, do you want to eat some Chinese?
All nine hundred million of them.
Rack jobbers rule.
Ready?
Yessir, Mr. Rudge.
Hop on the desk, then, eh?
Send them in.
MAN: Hey, Dennis!
WOMAN: Get out of the way, Hank.
[ALL TALKING SIMULTANEOUSLY]
RUDGE:
Settle down. Listen!
Quiet! Quiet!
- Hey, how about some flesh?
- Eat your heart out, Richard.
MAN: What have you been up to?
- Same as everybody.
Having a good time, staying stoned and getting laid.
- Ask her about the Florida show.
- Is the hometown concert sold out?
I think we got four seats in the parking lot...
...going for a bill apiece.
Rudge wants to put a roof in to hang them from the chandeliers.
- We're taping a TV special.
- What network?
RUDGE:
We got two of the networks fighting.
I've sold it to 15 countries, and I see a gross of four million.
And I do the singing! Me.
Mary Rose, how do you feel about doing a concert back home?
I think iùll be nice.
They're my own people.
They know and understand me, and I understand them.
You look tired.
If you had to work for a living, your ass would drag too.
So after my hometown show,
I'm thinking about taking a year off.
- A year off? What?
- How come you're taking a year off?
Sure, she's gonna take a year off.
The Virgin Mary's stepping off the bench to fill in.
Mr. Campbell, is this your idea?
Hold it! Hold it!
We got 20 minutes.
Who are all these people?
Everybody that doesn't belong in this dressing room, get out!
This is my family.
This is my sister-in-law.
- Out! You don't belong here.
- She's my sister.
- This is all my blood.
- You too, Brunhild.
Leùs go. Out!
Come on, girls. Can't you hear? Out!
There's a party after the show.
The band never listens to me.
Nice big one, save some for me sometime.
Smells like jockstraps in here.
- Danny, let me see the list.
- Here.
- Leùs cut "Fire Down Below."
- You always liked that one.
- Leùs cut "Keep on Rockin'," then.
- Rose, the seùs all right.
- It damn well is not!
- All those tunes you sing wonderfully.
- Lf I want to cut a song, thaùs it!
- Leùs cut it.
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
You're in good voice.
The mama's in good voice!
Here, thaùs for you, baby.
Thaùs a stopwatch.
I got 35 good minutes.
When I start to sing, push the button.
Let me go past 35 minutes...
...you'll hear from me, motherfucker!
- Thaùs a new one.
Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose!
[KNOCKING]
[CHANTS]
This is your night, baby. You own it!
You own it. Look out, New York!
[MUSIC STARTS]
I don't want you to say "motherfucker" tonight.
There are a lot of important critics here.
Cameras all over the place.
So please, don't say "motherfucker."
Go get them, baby!
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen, the Rose.
Hi, you motherfuckers!
Iùs midnight in Memphis
And all the boys are out tonight
Oh, midnight in Memphis
And my true love is not in sight
The neon's glowing
But I just don't see the light
I'm following my footsteps
Trying to find myself a friend
Oh, baby
Trying to see where they might end
I'm trying to break these blues
But I can't even get them to bend
Midnight in Memphis
Well, ya take me away
Midnight in Memphis
Iùs a long, long time
Before the day
Burnin' out on Beale Street
Can you hear that engine run
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Burnin' out on Beale Street
There's a girl in every door
Yeah
It don't matter what you got
They're asking even more
I heard the river rising
Rising up over my head
Heard the river rising
And this is what it said
I don't need no live ones
I just take care of the dead
Midnight in Memphis
Take me
Take me away
Midnight in Memphis
Long, long time before the day
Midnight in Memphis
Midnight in Memphis
Midnight in Memphis
Iùs a long, long time
Before the day
Before the day
I know!
Howdy, New York City!
How you doing?
Long time no see, huh?
You wanna know how I keep this tired, battered old body in shape?
The same way we're gonna get the whole world into shape.
Drugs, sex and rock 'n' roll!
Drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll!
Drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll!
- Yeah?
- You see whaùs going on?
What should I do? They keep handing her bottles up on the stage.
Thank you.
Some nights people say, "When's the first time you heard the blues?"
And you know what I tell them?
"The day I was born."
You know why? You know why?
Because I was born a woman.
We've got some noisy females in the house tonight.
Being a woman is so interesting, don't you find it?
What are we, ladies? We are waitresses at the banquet of life.
Get into that kitchen and rattle them pots and pans.
You better look good doing it...
...or else you're gonna lose a good thing.
And why do we do that? I'll tell you why. We do that to find love.
I love to be in love.
Don't you love to be in love?
Ain't it just great to be in love?
Ain't it grand, laying there late at night...
...waiting for your man to show up?
And when he finally does, about 4:00 in the morning...
...with whiskey on his breath and the smell of another woman on him...
Oh, honey, I can smell another woman at 500 paces.
Thaùs an easy one to catch.
Oh, Mama getting nasty.
What do you do when he comes home with the smell of another woman on him?
Do you say, "Honey, let me open up my loving arms and my loving legs"?
"Dive right in, baby, the water is fine."
Is that what you say, girls?
Or do you say, "Fuck this shit!
I've had enough of you, you asshole!
Pack your bags!
I'm putting on my waitress cap and my heels.
I'm gonna find me a good, true man!
A man to love me, for sure."
I'll tell you something.
At one time, I actually thought
I'd found myself one. I did.
When he held me in his arms
And said, "Baby"
When a man loves a woman
If she's bad
He can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend
If he put her down
When a man loves a woman
Spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to what he needs
Give up all his comforts
Go and sleep out in the rain
If she said
"Baby, that is how iùs gonna be"
When a man loves a woman
Give her everything that he has
Try to hold on
To her precious love
Crying, "Baby, baby
Please don't treat me bad"
When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
Yeah, she's bad
But, ooh
He's the last one to know
Loving eyes don't ever see
So this man says
He loves me
He loves me
He gives me everything
Everything, everything that he has
Trying to hold on
To my precious love
Crying, "Baby, baby
Don't you treat me, treat me bad"
Oh
Oh, baby
When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He could never hold another girl
Oh, you tell me
You love me, baby
And gonna hold me tight
Baby, baby
This is a man's
World
In this man's world
- Hurry up.
- Why couldn't I change?
We have only 30 minutes to get to Billy Ray's.
- We've got it covered.
- Everyone's got it covered, eh?
Hey, whaùs the matter?
Whaùs happening?
Jesus, I'm...
Oh, I'm hungry, I'm tired.
- Feed me, hold me, make me happy.
- Wait, I got something.
- What you got in that?
- Vitamins. Cs and B12s.
Cookies and milk.
- Kids' stuff.
- Yeah, keep it that way.
Wanna check? I've been clean so long my scars have healed.
I'm not checking your arms anymore.
Thaùs all behind us, eh?
- I look like shit!
- You look like a star!
I don't wanna go to Long Island to see hicks.
- Billy Ray's been begging to meet you.
- Then why don't he come to see me?
You can hear the whistle blow
A hundred miles
- Billy Ray?
- Shh!
- Billy Ray?
- What?
You remember Rudge Campbell.
This here is the Rose.
- Hi. How you doing? Hello, Sturdily.
- How are you, ma'am?
I wish this cherry was in my band.
You diddle that thing, son?
Oh, my, I don't believe you.
What a fine young piece, here.
Billy Ray, this is Rose.
- Hi, hello.
- Hi, Rose.
Gosh, I've loved you for so many years.
- You have?
- Yeah.
In fact, she did one of your tunes on her latest album.
I heard all about it. Iùs a pleasure meeting such a dainty lady.
How'd we miss getting together all this time?
Careful planning.
I look forward to hearing the rest of your catalogue.
I sang "Huntsville Prison," the place went apeshit.
They did.
I've heard a lot of good things about your record of "Huntsville."
Old Dee here says iùs about the best he ever heard.
- Says it even cut Loretta's.
- You never said that.
But I wanna be straight with you.
It didn't show me much.
Not much at all. You think
I'm kidding you, don't you?
I kind of hope so.
This worlÔs too full of bull already, lady.
Now, I don't begrudge anybody their due...
...but I'd appreciate you not recording any more of my tunes.
Be different if you knew what they was about.
Thaùs how I feel about it.
I wanna say something else.
I don't appreciate you coming here, talking that trash...
...especially to my son.
Rose!
Shit, you didn't have to do that.
Rose, baby, wait! Rose! Wait!
Come here, listen! Hey, wait!
Listen, that was horrible.
- You let him talk to me like that?
- What was I supposed to do?
If I knew, what the fuck would I need you for? You just stood there.
Listen, he's an asshole.
What can I tell you, eh?
- That doesn't make me feel any better.
- Don't let that stuff get to you.
What do you care about some redneck singer? You're the star.
Why didn't you tell him that?
- You're trying to sign him, ain't you?
- What?
- You're trying to sign him.
- I don't believe this.
- She's only kidding, God!
- "Dying to meet me," my ass!
You dragged me here for clout!
- It goddamn well backfired on you!
- Wrong!
- Don't say that.
- Hey, baby...
- Get lost! Fucking lowlifes!
- Calm down, Rose.
Don't you tell me to calm down.
- I'll calm down if you sit on my face.
- Oh, yeah? Is that right?
You're a maniac!
Life's a jack-off dream to you!
Fuck you! Fuck him! Fuck them all!
RUDGE: Come here. Help.
- Goddamn hippie. What happened?
- He passed out.
- Morris, get the first-aid kit.
- This car's taken.
- I wanna get out of here.
So does the cowboy.
Billy Ray owns the car for the night.
I got a great idea.
Let him walk! Let him walk!
- Let him walk!
- Come on, I don't need this.
Don't worry, lady, you just bought yourself a car and a driver.
Rose, come here, come back!
What are you looking at?
- You know who I am?
- Yeah. You're the Rose.
Is that all?
- Excuse me?
- Is that all you're gonna say?
I don't know...
I always liked your music. A lot.
Iùs okay, honey, you don't have to fall down and wet your pants.
My name's Houston.
You from Texas?
Yeah. Waxahachie.
- Waxa... What?
- Waxahachie.
Iùs got the highest rate per capita of insanity, suicide and incest...
...of just about any place in the country.
- Iùs a fun city on a Saturday night.
- Is that right?
- Where you headed, lady?
- I don't know. Big city.
- New York!
- I picked myself a live one tonight!
- Bright lights, big city.
- You smoking tonight, son.
Here, have one on your old mama.
Hey, thanks.
Jesus Christ, look what the cat dragged in.
- Those pies sure look good.
- Jello don't look bad either.
We don't serve hippies.
Well, thaùs okay because we don't eat them neither.
Arlene?
- Okay, I'll take care of it.
- I would like...
...ham and Swiss on rye, hold the mayo, and a beer.
I'd like a BLT with the mayo and some pickles.
Do yourself a big favor and order something to go, okay?
- We don't want no trouble, you know?
- Suits the shit out of me.
Give us the ham and cheese and...
What the hell are you looking at?
- Damn. Ain't you Paul Newman?
- Get lost, bimbo.
I can put some Danishes in a bag, and you can go.
- Whatever you've got thaùs quick.
- Okay.
Hey, Rose...
I'd haul ass if I was you.
Know what I mean?
- As soon as we get our stuff.
- Iùs coming.
- I'm ready to kick me some ass here!
- Take this sloppy whore out of here!
If your dick is as small as your brain, you're in a lot of trouble.
Oh, my God, don't!
- Give yourself a break.
- Knock it off!
Take this and go! Please, go!
Just get out of here, please.
Look, go, please.
Show's over, folks. This man's just gonna continue eating his soup.
Oh, God! Jack, get some ice!
Doggone, you slapped that sucker silly. I thought that was great.
- It was like being on TV.
- Let the good times roll.
JOURNALIST: Students were arrested for surrounding a chemical recruiter.
They claimed people were being burned to death...
Animals. I don't know how human beings can behave that way.
- Defoliants being sprayed to destroy Vietnamese food supply...
Houston?
You look like you need a drink.
And you know what?
Your mama's gonna buy you one.
We're gonna put our dancing shoes on and buy ourselves a drink.
Good deal, Lucille.
George! Big George!
Give me some skin, man.
How you doing?
- Fine, baby.
- My old pal, this is my new pal.
Letter to Daddy
His address is heaven above
- Oh, man! Oh, you freak.
- How are you?
Holy shit, your hair has a hard-on.
- Who's the young Republican?
- Don't dump on him.
He saved my life twice tonight.
The postman said thaùs best to do
Excuse me, dear.
I've got a little bag, very pure.
No lactose, no quinine.
You could run this horse to Aquaduct and win.
Mama don't ride the horse no more, didn't you hear? I'm clean.
- What are you drinking?
- Tequila.
A bottle of tequila, couple of glasses and no cracks.
Oh, how daring.
I used to be a big star too, Miss Hudson!
My sister, Henry.
- Weirdsville.
- Come on, relax.
Did you hear about the Polish lesbian?
She liked men!
I love you
Reminds me of a dream
I had once in the Philippines.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, bitch... Butch!
Butch, I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Right on. Thank you.
You're a wonderful audience.
We have somebody in the audience who tried to sneak in...
...a while ago, which is impossible for her.
She used to live upstairs. Every night we'd say, "Are you sleeping?"
She never was.
Where's the $10 you owe me, motherfucker?
How rude! She did a concert earlier tonight...
...where she slayed thousands, singing her guts out.
In fact, waiter, send her a drunk on me.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome please...
...I'm gonna get in trouble for pointing her out, the incredible Rose!
All right!
Big mama!
Stand by, Rosie, we got a surprise for you!
All right, gentlemen.
Hit it for the woman!
Hi, you motherfuckers!
I made it! That drag queen's doing me!
Slippin' in right in time
Here comes the stripper
Bringing on the night
Here comes the boys
Faces hidden from the night
Walk through the shadows
They got one thing in common
They got the fire down below
- Hands off!
- Come on. Come on.
Here come the banker
The lawyer and the cop
One thing for certain
Iùs never gonna stop
When it all gets too heavy
They come and they go
One thing in common
It happens in Vegas, Moline
Diana!
Went on yesterday
Iùs going on tonight
And somewhere there's somebody
Treatin' somebody right
Hello, gorgeous!
Talk about your secondhand Rose, huh?
Slippin' out of sight
They come and go
Are you in town for good, or for fun?
It happens out in Vegas, Moline
On the blue-blood streets of Boston
In Berkley, out in Queens
Went on yesterday
Iùs going on tonight
Somewhere there's somebody
Treatin' somebody right
Walk the streets
I'll find you anytime
Where the streetlights flicker
Bringing on the night
I'll be slipping into darkness
Slippin' out of sight
Oh, through the darkness
Oh, they come and they go
Oh, they come and they go
They got the fire down below
They got one thing in common
They got the fire down below
Far out! Far-fucking-out!
- Are you trying to get in my bloomers?
- Working on it.
You brown-eyed motherfucker, where you been all my life?
Ever polite, honey, ever polite.
- Thaùs the way my mama taught me.
- Which mama was that, baby?
Look at this place.
I'm rich. I could buy the whole damn place if I wanted to.
- You like being rich?
- I sure do. I do.
Someone spread the rumor being rich is a drag.
Whoever spread that rumor is dead broke.
- You ever rich?
- Not like that.
But once I went down the Little Big Horn River.
I never saw another soul for six days.
Felt like I owned the whole thing.
- Were you really alone for six days?
- Yeah.
I ain't been alone in about 300 years.
- Three hundred years?
- Yeah, 300 years.
You're something else, lady.
Something else.
Mister...
...so are you.
Thank you. This is very good.
- Do you think I'm sexy?
- You kidding?
Come on, the Rose wants to know.
Anybody who talks about themselves in the third person is Looney Tunes.
- You don't fool around, do you?
- I don't have the time.
You have time for me?
You wanna go steady? You wanna go steady? Do you? Do you?
I'll stop at a five-and-dime, get you a box of chocolate-covered cherries.
Oh, God, do you remember them?
Wrapped up in gold paper, with cracked hearts all over them?
On Valentine's Day, the boys and girls used to exchange them and...
Oh, I wish I'd known you when I was in high school.
I wish you had too.
I wish I had a girl with hair this color.
I don't need charity off trash like you.
Come on, what is it?
Whaùs the matter?
Oh, I hate this mushy love stuff, man!
Wake me up when the killing starts!
I'll tell you something...
...about me thaùs so weird, you won't even believe it.
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.
I bet you I will.
All right.
Here goes.
Once...
...when I was in high school...
...I got drunk one night, and I...
I took on the whole football team.
You always tell
Christmas stories like this?
- You're shocked, ain't you?
- No, I ain't shocked.
I woke up on the 50-yard line.
I'd hate to tell you some of the places I woke up.
You know, I waited all my life to go back there...
...like somebody, like a star.
I just wanna hear that hometown applause.
I want them to push and scream and scratch and bite...
...to get a view of the one and only Rose.
- She'll shove it right in their teeth.
- Shove what?
Herself. Me.
Old rich and famous me.
[PHONE RINGS]
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry.
No, I'll be there as soon as I can.
I was wrong.
I was wrong.
Oh, God! I was supposed to be at a recording session.
Oh, Jesus.
God, am I gonna get it.
Do I look old?
Where is everybody?
Hey, baby, whaùs shaking?
Where were you?
Rudge, this is my friend Houston Dyer.
Houston, this is my manager,
Rudge Campbell.
Howdy, nice to meet you, sir.
Terrific! Keep everybody waiting for hours, what do we get in return?
A fucking cowboy.
They said you'd never show up.
I said, "She'll show up."
And she shows.
Not one or two hours late...
...but five fucking hours and $3000 late.
These are real, live people you're talking to.
We go back to when you were still in high school!
We're in business.
I talk any way I like!
Miss Me-Give-Me-Mine treats me any way she likes, so you butt out!
Don't you talk that trash to him or to me.
I'm very sorry, my mistake.
I thought we had an appointment to make some money.
What a bummer.
Shook you up, huh?
Thaùs his favorite trick.
You know...
...I don't understand them.
- I was late...
...and he was pissed off, so he did a show about it!
Thaùs all we ever do around here.
- Got a scuzzy mouth.
- Shut up! He's a fucking magician.
He don't need help from meat in a chauffeur's cap.
Jesus.
Houston! Houston!
Come here!
She can have it now.
- Dyer.
- Rose, close that door.
- I gotta get out.
- Dyer, I can't let you go.
He's right about you.
Miss Me-Give-Me-Mine.
- I want Chinese, and I want it now!
- Close that fucking door.
- I'm going, Rose!
- No!
- This ain't gonna work!
- You're not going anywhere without me.
- Get out!
- Never.
- Rose, I said get out.
- Make me!
I don't need this shit, lady.
I never did, I never fucking did!
Asshole, move your car!
I didn't come back for some hootchy-kootchy woman to blow my mind!
I ain't a hootchy-kootchy woman!
You can't park in the middle of the street!
For chrissake, get that goddamn car out of here!
Get that goddamn thing out of here, for chrissake!
- Move it! Whaùs wrong with you?
- Oh, shut up! Goddamn it!
Come here, you crazy lady!
Dyer! Dyer!
Men, my favorite!
Dyer! You see a guy come through here?
- Thaùs all we got here!
- Houston Dyer, report to the Rose!
- Hey, miss!
- My Lord, look at this.
- Hey, lady!
- Dyer! Houston!
Get the hell out of here!
What is this?
I picked myself a peck of pickled peppers this time. Houston Dyer!
Don't hide it till I've tried it!
You keep watering that,
I know iùs gonna grow.
Let her stay. We need a change in atmosphere. Wanna borrow my towel?
- Houston?
MAN: She has three-and-a-half rooms.
There you are!
All right, everybody out!
You can go in the main lounge and shuffleboard on the forward deck.
- Why don't you just leave?
- This one came as a raccoon.
Cha-cha into the casino.
There will be a masquerade ball.
Thank you so much for coming.
If I don't get a kind word in the next four seconds...
...I'm gonna do something fierce.
And one... and two... and...
At ease, sailor, at ease.
Take a break.
Oh, Dyer...
...I'm awful sorry.
I got a big mouth.
Gee, iùs kind of nice in here.
Are all steam rooms like this?
Why do you wanna walk out on me?
It ain't you so much as it is your life.
I mean, iùs like a grenade range.
And iùs me too.
Lordy.
What do you mean iùs you too?
Oh, a mystery...
Come on, Houston,
I told you about the football team.
You see...
...I'm a sergeant in the fucking Army.
I'm AWOL. I shoulÔve been back at Fort Campbell three weeks ago.
- You mean, you ain't no chauffeur?
- No, ma'am. No, ma'am.
- No chauffeur, not the Lone Ranger.
- I've been had.
Sometimes I get scared.
Maybe the Army's all I know.
- I mean, I've been in since I was 18.
Yeah, me and Vincent Birkham, we joined on my birthday.
You know, hot food, roof over my head...
...socks all lined up in a row.
It was a beautiful thing.
And then it kind of went sour.
You thinking about walking away from the Army for good?
Yeah.
Listen, you don't have to go back.
You don't. You can stay with me.
I'll take real good care of you.
Okay, lady, leùs go! Party's over.
I had a good time. I sure did.
- You got it. Whaùs her name? Jean?
- We've had enough of this lark.
Rudge! After the Florida show, we're canceling all our bookings.
- Whaùs wrong now?
- Everything.
- My life is like a grenade range.
- Thaùs specific, anyway.
- I'm gonna wait in the car.
- Can I have your autograph?
Why don't you tell the truth?
You find some hustler, you're with him a fast ten minutes.
Because he hasn't picked your pocket yet...
...or said you look like
Petunia Pig, he's a white knight!
There's few real men left in the world.
I got one and I'm gonna hang on.
After that Florida show, he and I are going away together. That is that.
They'll bury you in the remainder racks!
I'll take my chances. Give me my bag.
- Wait! How does he feel about it?
- He don't know about it yet.
- Here we go again.
- Leùs get out of here.
You can't just leave. You're crazy.
You got your whole career.
You stay with me until after
I do that show back home...
...and I'll go anywhere with you.
The woods, the mountaintop, anywhere.
Out of the state? Out of sight?
- How about out of the country?
- Out of the world.
Oh, Rose, Rose!
You gotta be wacko!
Yeah, I know.
What are you gonna do about it?
You're in love.
Yeah, all right. Okay, okay.
MAN: I met this chick and I let her backstage.
WOMAN: Iùll start moving and tell us something else.
Great. Arrangements? Marvelous.
Marvelous, yeah.
Come on now, just concentrate.
Different strokes for different folks.
- What?
- The Ouija girls.
Oh, right, right.
Here goes.
Sipping whiskey.
- Lynchburg, Tennessee.
- Population: 517.
Waco, Texas. Population: 94,632.
Everybody wants to be a shit-kicker.
- You and Rose are getting along, eh?
- Yeah.
I'm just... I'm just really glad she's found a friend at last.
I've seen them come and go.
And I've always hoped that one might stick. Give her an anchor.
You don't think she's drinking too much, do you?
You been on the road with a rock 'n' roll band?
- First time.
- You're gonna love it.
Why don't you let me
Call you sweetheart
I'm in love with you
Let me hear you whisper
That you love me too
Keep the love burning
In your eyes
Let me call you...
Where am I?
I never know where the fuck I am.
All these fucking clouds look alike.
Easy, honey.
Sweet Rosie.
Welcome to rock 'n' roll.
And no two-bit fascist
Gonna shoot us down
Come on, children
Bring your guns, bring your guns
To town
Keep on rockin'
Keep on rockin'
Keep on rockin'
Keep on, rock 'n' roll
Gonna never die
Thank you, St. Louis!
Everything okay here? Everything okay?
Hey, Don! What a great job.
Thank you very much. How was it?
Chief, would you like to come to meet Rose?
Rose? She's a little bit high. Rose?
Police Chief Morrison and his wife.
He gave us extra protection tonight.
- You have a generous manager.
- I've heard Rudgie called many things.
First time I've heard him called generous.
- Don! Dennis! Rose?
- There you are.
Don Franks, handling Midwest distribution.
Give me a hankie, what a shvitz.
Honey, you were sensational.
Incredible, insane!
The band was so together.
You just put me away. Really.
I wet my pants.
- Don't you wanna go and change?
- My shorts were in flames!
- Rose is tired.
- How can you tell?
He's a good friend of ours.
- Rack jobbers rule.
- They don't rule me, I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?
Don't keep telling her "tired."
She's got commitments, and these people are important.
- The lady needs a rest!
- Yeah, when I tell her!
And when she's finished her business.
- What song are you singing now?
- Having a word with your friend.
I'm really tired, I'll see you on the plane tomorrow. Take me to bed.
You get a photo?
I'm not sleeping over.
Call me tomorrow,
I've got something extra for you.
No, thaùs cool.
Dennis got you covered.
Keep it cool, man. Keep it cool, huh?
Hey, Dennis.
- They don't know when this will clear.
- Christ.
- Can't we even wait on the plane?
- I'll check it out, all right?
Fine, fine.
- Do you want your fortune told?
- No, thanks.
- Let me see your tongue.
- Beg your pardon?
Come on, don't be a putz, let me see your tongue.
Come on, let me see your real tongue.
Thaùs the tongue I know.
Toots, you look a little green around the gills.
- Drink this. Vitamins and minerals.
- Thaùs really far out.
Drink it, honey. You need it.
You gotta keep up your strength.
Oh, drink it, come on.
Don't be a chump. Drink it.
My brave boy. I'll get you straightened out when we go away.
- I think this'll do it.
- I think thaùll do it, for sure.
Terrible, ain't it?
- Who ordered a dozen raw eggs?
- Right here!
- And a dozen raw beers!
- Yeah!
Houston, look.
Look what the Army did to those poor, little boys.
- You better let them little boys be.
- You know me better than that by now.
Hey, colonel!
Colonel!
I think she's talking to you.
- You talking to me?
- You know I am.
Come on over here.
Airborne, Houston, airborne.
Okay, everyone, we're getting our clearance for Memphis soon.
The fog has lifted. All right?
- Who's this, then?
- Rudge, this is Mal. This is Mal.
He's gonna be traveling with me, my personal bodyguard and masseur.
MAN:
We're out of ice.
This troupe gets bigger every day.
And if free don't mean
For nothing
I sold my soul to rock 'n' roll
I bought these devil chains
My baby wants me home
Can't refuse him
The one that goes from heaven
Need a short vacation
Forever, forever, forever
Keep on going
Till I'm gone
Bought these devil chains
Oh, baby wants me home
Can't refuse him
The one that goes from heaven
Straight to Houston, ho
Did you like it
Was it good
Did you like it
Aah
Sold my soul to rock 'n' roll
Iùs time to take that train
To Houston
The one that goes from heaven
MAN:
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
What the hell's the matter with security?
MAN:
Fuck!
- Christ, man.
- Where are the roadies?
Probably backstage with the food.
Oh, baby, baby.
Oh, I'm so hot.
Oh, Sarah. Goddamn, how you been?
Houston, this is Sarah Willingham.
Sarah, this is...
This is Houston Dyer.
Looks more like Galveston to me.
SARAH: God, your hair looks beautiful.
ROSE: It looks very wet.
- The color's wonderful.
- Thank you.
- Does that feel good?
- Don't be a nit.
Of course it feels good.
Now, Sarah, don't get carried away...
You're getting it all over my face.
You have a license for this, madam?
This is wonderful.
Oh, girl.
- Sarah...
- What?
Oh, Sarah, you're gonna get me all fucked up again.
- Rudge told me you were fucked up.
- I love how you say "fuck."
Sounds like tea and crumpets at the Ritz-Carlton.
I missed you.
I got to tell you something.
Something wonderful's happened to me.
That guy? That guy Houston Dyer?
A real man.
He's solid, he's not like any man
I ever met in my life.
He likes me.
He doesn't care what I did before, what I am, who I am.
Sarah, he makes me so happy.
I can see.
Yeah, I guess it shows.
Well, mine was a poetry teacher at Bennington.
He was 30 and I was 18.
I'm jealous of you, Rose.
I want what you have.
You're beautiful.
I love you.
Why?! Why?!
- No, listen to me. Let me explain!
- Shut up!
You fuck! Why don't you listen to me?!
- Rose, Rose!
- You pig! You stupid...
Oh, God!
I'm sorry. Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.
Baby, baby, I love you so much.
- Just hold on.
- Why can't you find him?
- Rudge, iùs Bernie.
- Why the hell can't you find him?
Excuse me, excuse me!
Madeleine, my dear...
...would you mind going and brushing your hair?
- Why can't you find him?
- I didn't lose him!
I ain't so sure about that. Come on.
- Where you going?
- You can't find him, I will.
We're going to Florida, hometown, you'll show them all!
MAN: Step right up, folks, the show is about to start.
See the prettiest girls this side of the Mississippi.
I know you.
Hey! Is there a dude in here by the name of Houston Dyer?
MEN:
Get the hell out of here.
I hope your goddamn chickens die.
You lousy farmers!
MAN: What the hell was that?
WOMAN: Did you see her hair?
Oh, God, I was such a good lay.
How could he just go off and leave me?
- Tell me, Mal, whaùs wrong with me?
- Nothing.
I should have gone to college.
- Wait a minute, follow me.
- Whoa, hold it.
I'll clear the area for you there, trooper.
Oh, the hell with him.
I don't give a damn about him, anyway.
Positive?
Nope.
Well, what are we gonna do now?
Sonny, there's only one thing left to do.
Whaùs that?
Go home.
- Did you find her?
- The only thing I do have is that...
...she and Mal tore up downtown last night looking for Dyer.
They never went back to the hotel.
Black coffee, honey.
She'd better show, or I'll break her fucking feathers!
God, look at this.
Oh, Lord!
- Feels funny, huh?
- It sure feels funny.
- Does it look littler?
- Oh, you said it.
Littler and poorer...
...and dirtier...
...and meaner.
This is where I went to high school.
Football field...
Got me some memories of the football field.
This is the vacant lot where I got my first kiss.
- From Eddie Pompadour.
- Eddie Pompadour?
Eddie-fucking-Pompadour, dear.
I was 12 years old.
That wasn't his real name, but I called him that...
...because he had this Elvis Presley complex that went to his hair.
A little swoop in the front.
I thought he was it, man.
You see that?
Thaùs my house over there.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
See those two people out there in the yard? Thaùs my parents.
Come on, man. Come on, leùs go.
- Honey, will you get the phone?
- I'm washing the car. Can you get it?
ROSE:
Oh, there's LeonarÔs Grocery.
- You feel like a Dr. Pepper, buddy?
- Sure.
Is there something
I can do for you, ma'am?
Don't you know who I am?
Nope, I can't say I do.
Give me a Moon Pie and a Dr. Pepper, Mr. Leonard.
Oh, iùs Mary Jo... Rose Foster.
- How you been, Mary Rose?
- Okay.
What brings you back to these parts?
Jeez.
Maybe next time you'll know who I am.
I am the Rose.
The Rose!
Oh, my God. This is her.
Look at her.
- It looks exactly like her.
- I don't believe it.
MAN: Thirty-nine flood.
MAN 2: Fifty-one, please.
Fifty-one, please.
Check, one, two.
Soap, soap. Sin. Test.
Thaùs good on the highs...
...but check the crossover and bring it up around 300. Book. Bottom.
Book. Thaùs it.
We're getting real close.
If you could give me some more volume now...
You show 53 up? Thank you.
Can you try that light again?
We're sold out.
I'm sorry, no tickets.
Standing room only.
I checked every hospital and sheriff's office around.
- She'll be here.
- I'm worried.
Well, don't worry. She'll be here.
She needs this concert.
She'd crawl on her knees to get here.
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it!
You can't go in there, lady.
- Hey! Hey, stop that woman!
- Hey, lady, stop your car!
Hey, lady!
[ROSE HONKS CAR HORN]
- I'll be damned.
- What did I tell you?
- I made it.
- Yeah. Yeah, I see.
Yeah, and...
- I've been doing some thinking.
- Oh, yeah?
And iùs definite, Rudge.
I'm gonna take a year off.
- And...
- Yeah, go ahead.
I, uh...
I don't want to hurt the band none, you know. So I think...
...I think iùs a good idea if we keep them on salary...
...after tonight just until...
...I can decide...
...when to come back and all.
Stuff like that.
You finished?
Yeah, I'm finished.
Do you know what this is?
- No.
- Well, you ought to. You signed it.
- Well, it must be my contract.
- Right. Good.
I've been reading it, and I've been thinking about it.
For the last few nights
I've thought about us...
...about all of those filthy holes we played.
All the hustlers I had to bargain with every time you opened your mouth.
And not all for you.
It was for me too, you see, because I loved it.
I loved it. I loved getting hold of a selfish, hopeless junkie...
...and turning her into a performer they'd mortgage Australia for.
Do you wanna play Brisbane? London?
You wanna play Paris? Tokyo?
And then, last night,
I woke up and I thought:
"Fuck all this.
Did we go down the road together or not?" And I came to a decision.
Either you fulfill all the commitments you asked me to make...
...or you fulfill none of them.
Do you get it?
- You're not singing tonight.
- You're crazy.
- The concerùs off.
- What do you mean?
I'm the promoter. If I wanna blow it, I damn well will.
Everyone will get their money back,
I'll pay them myself. By the way...
...get yourself another manager.
I don't want you in my life anymore.
You can start your vacation right now.
You're fired.
OVERSEER: May I have your attention?
I want all stadium personnel...
...to meet with the production crew in five minutes...
...at the north end of the stadium.
Thank you.
ROSE:
Rudge!
Rudge!
Stop!
Stop! Where you going?
Turn around, motherfucker!
Stop!
Turn around. Don't you walk out on me!
You can't do this.
I'm talking to you!
Come back here!
Come back! Come back!
I'm talking to you!
Where you going? Where you going?
Where you going?
Where's everybody going?
Houston.
- I missed you.
- Houston.
Oh, God. I thought
I'd never see you again.
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
I tried to stay away, but I couldn't.
- Where have you been?
- Taking care of some business.
- Rudge fired me.
- Fired you?
He fired me.
I came to get everything straightened out. And he fired me!
He can't fire you.
Hell, he works for you!
He's the promoter. He pulled the rug right out from under me.
Oh, God, what am I talking to you for?
Who the hell are you, anyway?
I'm your own private brown-eyed motherfucker, remember?
Oh, you. Oh, you.
What am I gonna do now?
Where am I gonna go?
I got nowhere to go.
Shit, I'm so goddamn mad!
I feel...
I feel so bad.
- Take it easy.
- I feel so bad.
We'll just go away. We'll go someplace where we can breathe.
All I know is how to sing, you know?
I can't walk out on that for something that I don't know nothing about.
My whole life is falling apart, and you wanna buy me a sleeping bag.
Sleeping bags are nice. Cozy.
We'll just go till we don't wanna go anymore.
- Where we gonna go?
- How's Mexico grab you?
I'm a sucker for adventure.
I really am.
Houston? There's something
I wanna tell you.
Come here.
Come here, I wanna whisper.
Rose.
MAN:
Parking in the rear, please.
I don't even have a sound check.
Are you crazy?
We gotta get her here.
Forget these other commitments!
- I don't pay you to think.
- Are you insane?
Do you wanna tell these people you don't even know where she is?
Insane? I spent years in the trenches with a certifiable Section Eight!
Now, I won all the marbles. See?
I've played my ace in the hole.
Maybe you'll end up winning.
But I think your little game stinks.
Ain't nature wonderful?
Doggone, hauling ass down to Mexico!
- Gotta make myself beautiful.
- You already are.
You supposed to wear glasses or what?
Oh, look at that!
You see that neon sign up there?
You gotta pull up. Thaùs Monte's, the first place I ever sang.
- I thought we were going to Mexico.
- Please? Give me a break.
I just wanna see if they still know who I am.
Rosie's back!
- How are you, sweetheart?
- Oh, Monte!
How are you, Rose?
You look wonderful!
How's it feel to be a great big star?
Don't go away, I'll be back.
Stay right there.
How are you, Rose?
Milledge! Honey, are you still here?
Your mother know you're out with a hippie freak?
- Christ, some things never change.
- Here we go.
- Heard you were in town.
- I'm in town.
Monte! Are we gonna do some serious juicing or not?
- Come on. Bourbon. Double.
- A shot glass for you...
...and a little bourbon. What are you doing way up here, anyway?
- I came to see you, fool.
- You did?
I miss you, you're a great human being.
Your boyfriend, whaùs he want?
I don't know. He don't look so happy.
Give him a Thunderbird and ginger ale.
Chase it with a Ripple.
- What do you really want?
- Give me a beer.
Here you go. All right, beer.
Here you go. There's the bottle, and there's the beer.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
- Do that for me again.
- The usual, a great big one for Rose!
Sing a song, the drinks are on the house!
- Is that right? You got it!
- I got it?
Ladies and gentlemen!
The Rose is gonna sing a song for us!
Give her a big hand.
Twelve bars!
Twelve-bar blues in E! Shuffle!
- Where you going?
- To do what I do.
- Hey, you with her, man?
- Yeah.
Got any reds?
All right.
Wanna score?
I'm holding the greatest dope.
I got whites, reds, windowpane, super smack, anything you want.
Hey, man. Take a fucking hike.
- It was gonna be for free, man.
ROSE: I do love a reunion.
Give me a beer.
You know women don't like this woman
'Cause I always speak my mind
But the men are crazy about me
You gotta love me with a thrill
'Cause baby, if you don't
I gotta find a man who will
You gotta love me with a feeling
Or you don't love me at all
You know I'm the kind of woman
I don't want no halfway stuff
The cops once took me in
But I did not need the bail
I shook it for the judge
And he, he put that cop in jail
You gotta love me with a feeling
Remember this?
Come on, get up. This pig can sing.
Get behind her, on your feet!
You remember the Lake Worth game?!
Hey, she was good!
Do you want to do it again, Rose?
The line forms behind me! I'll be first. You want sloppy seconds?
Fucking-A!
You all stop that! Stop, please!
- Come on!
- Iùs supposed to be a party.
Get her out of here before the trouble starts!
- Come on, we gotta go!
- No, you spoiled everything!
Leùs get out of here!
These low-rent motherfuckers ain't gonna appreciate you!
- Come on!
- You ruined it! You ruined it!
- Get in this car.
- You ruined it, you ruined it!
- Just get in there.
- You ruined it!
Who the hell do you think you are?
[PHONE BUZZES]
Fuck off!
Iùs Rudge. He wants me back.
He says anything... anything I want.
He's crawling.
Don't look at me like that. Please?
Don't look at me like that!
Jesus, I'm sorry. I did it again.
Oh, Jesus, I wish you loved me.
Oh, please.
Where you going?! Where you going?!
Hey!
Where you going?!
Houston!
Where you going?
Please!
Please...
Where's everybody going?!
Damn. Damn, Sam.
- Sam. How you been, baby?
- Hello, sweet lady.
- I'm fine. How are you doing?
- Sam, I've gotta go.
I'm gonna give you gratis some of the finest shit this side of Marseille.
- Sam, I don't do that shit.
- This is the best there is.
The best...
But I don't...
Iùll help you.
Just for old times' sake.
For old times' sake, Rose.
- My own works. You know why?
- Why?
Because you're the best.
Be good to yourself, okay? I love you.
Band to the side. I think you'd better get her here pretty soon, okay?
Don't worry, she'll be here.
Get off the goddamn phone.
Get off the phone.
Get off... Shit.
COACH: One, two, three!
TEAM: One!
- One, two, three!
- Two!

Operator?
Please. Please, help me.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
L... I gotta...
I gotta find the stadium.
MAN: Parking lot A is full.
Please go to parking lot B.
Don't park in undesignated spaces.
Baby, where are you?
I'm at school.
No, my high school.
How's the house?
Standing room only.
You got... You have to come pick me up.
No, I can't make it by myself.
I'll be waiting. I'm... I'm...
I'm at the phone booth...
...in the... In the parking lot.
Hey, you sound sick.
No! No, I'm all right.
No, I'll make it. I'll make it.
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.
I'll be just fine. Okay.
Everything's cool.
Hello, Mom?
Yeah, yeah, iùs me.
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't have to come.
No, too much traffic and crowded.
Iùll be crowded.
Real crowded and everything.
Daddy?
Daddy, is that you?
Are you on the phone upstairs?
Well, I miss you too.
I miss you both.
No, no, no, no, no.
I already told Mama.
I don't want you to come, iùll be...
Iùs too much trouble.
Oh, no, I'm wonderful!
I'm fine. Everything's great.
Great.
Great, everything's great.
I know.
We're taking right off after the concert.
We're gonna go to New Orleans.
But I'm gonna try and get back for Easter.
You know, I...
I'm... I'm so tired of the road.
No, I'm so tired.
I wanna stop so bad.
But, you know, there's only one way to do that.
You just gotta...
You just gotta...
...make up your mind you're gonna stop.
Oh, yes, I promise.
I promise.
Say... Say hi to...
Say hi to Carleen and Marge, okay?
I love you.
Bye.
MAN:
Get ready, everybody.
This ain't gonna work.
We're going to a hospital.
It feels real good to be home.
And...
And...
And you're my family.
Thank you for coming.
L... I didn't mean...
I didn't mean to be late.
Do you forgive me?
[LOUD CHEERING]
Well...
...l...
I forgive you...
...too.
What are we waiting for, boys? Boys?
"Stay with Me," baby. Come on.
Mama's home.
Mama is home.
Where did you go...
...when things went wrong
Who did you run to...
...to find a shoulder
To lay your head upon
Baby, wasn't I there
Didn't I take good care of you
Oh no, I can't believe
You're leaving me
Stay with me, baby
I'm begging you to stay with me
Stay with me, baby
I can't go on
Who did you touch...
...when you needed tenderness
I gave you so much
And in return
I found happiness
Baby, what could I do
Maybe I was too good
Too good to you
Oh no, I can't believe
You're leaving me
Stay with me, baby
Why don't you
Why don't you just stay with me, baby
Stay with me, baby
Remember you said
You were always gonna love me
Remember you said
You'd never, ever leave me
Remember, remember
I'm asking you, begging you
Stay with me
Baby, baby, baby
Why don't you stay with me
I can't
I can't go on
Well, I'm a young woman
And I could get plenty of men
But honey, keeping 'em's
The hard part
Yeah, sometimes I find
I find I try so hard
Maybe this time
I should be the one to go away
'Cause honey, ain't it my turn to have
Somebody grab hold of me and say
No, don't go
You can't go
Stay with me, baby
I'm begging you to stay with me
Stay with me, baby
I can't, I can't
I can't
Stay
Stay with me, baby
Why don't you stay with me, baby
Stay with me, baby
I can't
I can't go on
I got a little song that I want to sing to you...
...that I learned when I was...
...just so high.
It went...
It went...
Let me call you sweetheart
In love with...
...you
Where are you going?
Where's everybody going?
MAN: Get a doctor!

BEN: Nasty night.
- Is it?
I'm one big puddle.
Well, watch where you're dripping,
I just mopped.
Sorry. I'd like a room, please.
Sure you would.
So you can go drip in there.
Ten bucks.
You sign the registration.
- I'll check your valuables.
BEN: I know.
You're dripping.
- What?
- I said, "You're dripping."
Well, of course I'm dripping.
It's pouring out there.
Well, try not to.
They don't like you dripping here.
Thank you.
See you.
- Hope not.
- That's 416, coming up.
- That is 416.
- Well, that's a good floor for that one.
Nobody ever goes up there.
Well, look who's back.
Hello, stranger.
Hello, Abe.
Oh, no.
- I thought you'd sworn off this place.
- Well, I thought I had too.
ABE:
You got homesick for us, right?
Didn't have much choice.
Been barred from the Atheneum.
ABE: Come on. Nobody gets barred from the Atheneum.
How did you manage that?
- Well, there was this man there...
- A fat man, right?
Fat?
He was the Magic Mountain.
He drove me into one of my frenzies.
I went berserk and kicked his door open.
So they threw me out, told me never to come back.
I was willing to pay for it.
I just wanted to talk. You know how I am.
- Hey, you wanna check that?
- Oh, no, no. That's my costume.
I'm entered in a talent contest tonight.
It's good to be back, Abe.
I feel strangely optimistic about this evening.
- Yeah, well, don't kick any doors in.
- I hope I don't have to.
Driver, I left my money.
Will you wait? I'll be right back.
320 coming up. That is 320.
- I'd...
- Good evening, I wonder...
There's a line, buddy.
CHUCK: There's a line.
- Surely.
I'd prefer something on 3.
Did they ever put you on 4?
It's Siberia up there.
Thank you.
That's 421 coming up. That is 421.
Hey, can you...? Could...? Could...?
Could you...?
Can you cash a check for me?
It's on ohio State National.
What do I look like, a teller?
You don't understand.
I got a cab waiting. I'll be back.
I am planning to come here.
That's why I got a cab to go somewhere and stay. I've come, see?
ABE:
You got a credit card?
PROCLO: Right here, yeah.
- I can take that.
Yeah, well, he can't.
[HoRN HoNKING]
You hear that? That's him.
Look, I got all the identification in the world.
Blue Cross, Rotary Club, driver's license.
Here. Here's my business card.
"Proclo Sanitation Services,
Gaetano Proclo, president."
That's me.
- I'm sorry.
PROCLO: Oh, come on.
Do I look like someone who would try to pass a bad check?
Yeah.
Yeah, of course I do.
Now can you see me?
Everything else is real.
Who are you running from?
My maniac brother-in-law who's gonna kill me tonight if he can find me.
You're looking at a potential dead man.
I'm begging you.
It's a matter of life and death.
CHRIS:
Hey, all right.
- Does anybody have a cab waiting?
PROCLO: What?
- Is that your cab out there?
PROCLO: Yeah.
You've also got one very pissed off driver.
PROCLO:
How pissed off is he?
On a 10 scale, 10.
Darn it.
Please!
Well, I really shouldn't be doing this, but...
- You're a good man...?
- Abe.
Abe.
Abe, I'm gonna have a novena said for you when I get back to Cleveland.
- What's your last name? Abe what?
- Leftkowitz.
I'll still have a novena said for you when I get back.
Thank you. Excuse me.
[HoRN HoNKING]
I had a novena said for me once.
- I asked to wake up gorgeous.
ABE: So, what happened?
Well, look at me.
[CHUCKLING]
- Hey, Chris, you wanna sign in?
- You bet I will.
- How is that gorgeous son of yours?
- You're too late, he's getting married.
- Terrific. You give him my love, will you?
- Sure thing.
- He need someone to practice with?
- He's been practicing.
- That's why he has to get married.
- Yeah.
Well, compared to me, Abe, she would have to be an amateur.
Ronald Reagan? Oh, come on, Chris.
Oh, you know he used to be lovers with John wayne.
ABE:
Sure he did.
Right after he broke up with Xavier Cugat.
People like you think the world is queer.
Well, it's lucky for people like you it is.
[CAB DRIvER LAUGHING]
All right.
CAB DRIvER:
Change a 10.
He can't change a 10. Do you believe it?
New York City, one of the great cities of the world. This driver I have can't change a 10.
Hey, did I ever have you?
- What?
- I've got a rotten memory that way.
- You never used to live in Rego Park?
- No.
CHRIS: You look like someone
I knew from Rego Park.
PROCLO: I'm afraid not.
CHRIS: He was a large man like you.
He was in ladies shoes, I remember.
Well, I'm from Cleveland and I'm in refuse. Excuse me.
CHRIS:
I guess not, then. Sorry.
PROCLO:
Perfectly all right.
A gay garbage man?
You never can tell.
That's so true. I mean, look at me.
If you just saw me walking down the street you'd think I was a queen.
[WHISTLE BLowlNG]
Try to hold out, men. Help is on the way!
340 coming up. That is 340.
She's here, boys.
[IN HIGH volCE]
I'd like a room, please.
One of your private rooms.
How much is that?
ABE: You want what?
- A room.
- I was told you had private rooms?
- Yeah, we got rooms.
Well, then I'd like one, sir.
How much is that?
How long?
- Is what?
- How long do you want the room for?
Three or four hours should be sufficient for my purposes.
I don't care what your purposes are.
Twelve is our minimum.
- All right, 12 then, sir.
- All right, that's 10 bucks.
You check your valuables and sign the register.
Tell me something.
Has a...
Balding, middle-aged, fat man come in here recently?
I don't believe what just came in here recently.
You're not a cop, are you?
I'm a detective.
Michael Brick, the Greybar Agency.
What do I do now?
Through there and up the stairs.
- Someone will show you your room.
- Thank you, sir.
- And let me give you a little tip, Brick.
- Yes, sir?
Stay out of the steam room.
- Why, sir?
- It gets pretty wild in there.
Oh, I can take it, sir.
In my line of work,
I get to do a lot of wild things.
This is my first seduction job.
- Wish me luck.
- With that voice you gonna need it.
Save your money. Ten bucks for this place is 10 bucks for nothing.
[CHATTERING IN SPANISH]
No rain, he tells me.
No rain, he says.
No rain.
Fucking weatherman.
That little maric髇.
One spot on this dress and I am finished.
The biggest night of my life, it's pissing dogs and cats.
That's cats and dogs.
Are you a producer?
No.
Are you sure?
- Yes.
- Oh.
That's okay. You never know, huh?
[SCREAMS THEN
CHATTERING IN SPANISH]
My hair. Not my hairs.
All right. Go ahead, say it.
No, it's okay, I can take it.
Tell me I look like shit.
Why would I say something like that to such an attractive young lady?
You boys really know how to cheer up a girl when she's down in the dump.
My boyfriend Hector see me do that, he killed you with a knife this big.
He hates maric髇es, that Hector.
It's okay.
He's a ball-breaker with me too, mister.
But I'm going to show them, chico.
And tonight is the night
I'm going to do it.
I heard on the grapevine...
...there's going to be a big producer out in the front...
...watching your show tonight. Unquote.
Some day you're going to see the name of Googie Gomez in lights.
And you are gonna say to yourself:
"Was that her?"
And then you gonna answer to yourself:
"That was her."
But you know something, mister?
I was always her, just nobody knows it.
- Who the hell was that?
- Googie.
- I thought this is a bathhouse.
ABE: It is.
- No, I mean, a male bathhouse.
- It is.
- What she doing in here?
- Googie sings in The Pits.
The pits? What pits?
- The nightclub.
- You got a nightclub in there?
We got nightclub, movies, swimming pool, steam room, massage table...
...discoth鑡ue, bridge, amateur night and free blood tests every wednesday.
ABE:
How did it go today, Mo?
Eh.
[SIGHS]
Oh, boy. I don't wanna even think what she does.
Mo is just our accountant.
When I couldn't get a plane,
I told the cab...
...to bring me to the last place
Carmine would look for me.
You found it.
Now, you put your valuables in there.
- And you sign the book.
- Thank you.
Except everybody in the world's already in there.
- I need calm, safety, privacy tonight.
ABE: All right.
Keep your door locked and stay in your room.
Don't worry, I will.
"Ronald Reagan"?
ABE: You can write John Doe for all I care.
- Any name at all?
Abe, I'm gonna talk to the pope about getting you canonized.
"Carmine vespucci.
Bensonhurst...
...Brooklyn."
Who's that?
My maniac brother-in-law.
He was gonna kill me tonight.
- What did you do?
- I got born and married his sister.
Listen, do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
The man who save my life can ask me anything at all.
- You ever been in a place like this?
- Oh, sure.
We got a Jack De Lane's in Cleveland.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
ABE [o vER P.A.]: 210 coming up.
That's 210. Tiger, make sure it's c/ean.
Hey, where's room 210?
- It's up there.
- Thank you.
[GASPING]
Hello there.
Hello.
What seems to be the trouble?
Well, I'm looking for room 210.
Oh, well, you just come right along with me.
Thank you very much.
It's there.
There will be an orgy beginning in room 340 in exactly four minutes.
Orgy in 340, four minutes.
I couldn't resist taking this panettone back with me.
I just love panettone and you can't get this brand in Cleveland.
Do you like panettone?
- It's right here.
- Oh, thank you.
Uh...
Uh...
This doesn't look like room 210.
See, there are clothes here.
You'll never guess what I made for dinner so I'm going to tell you.
- I beg your pardon?
- A nice, rich, ground-pork meatloaf...
...with mozzarella cheese center, gobs of mashed potatoes swimming in gravy...
...carrots floating in butter and for a salad, avocado chunks with Roquefort dressing.
Could you just die?
I could just...
- I don't know what I could...
- Then, Dutch chocolate cake...
...with big scoops of mocha walnut ice cream...
...and a fudge malted.
- It sounds delicious.
- You could have been there.
- I was in Brooklyn.
- Lf you'll excuse me.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.
How about an 閏lair?
Some homemade brownies? I know.
- A corned beef on rye with a nice dill pickle.
- No, really, I'm not hungry.
[CLAUDE SQUEALS]
How much do you weigh?
- What?
- What is your weight?
- Two-ten, 220?
- Two-twenty.
Two-twenty.
Jellyroll baby.
- You're my jellyroll man.
- I think there's some confusion here.
Jellyroll cupcake,
I'm your jellyroll fan.
In fact, I know there is some confusion here.
Stop. You're hurting me.
I'm hurting you?
Help. Help. Help.
[CLAUDE SQUEALING]
All right, fat man, leave the little guy alone.
Come. Aren't you supposed to be in 210?
You get up there and don't cause any more trouble.
What do you think this is, the YMCA?
Listen, I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
Oh.
Well, I certainly hope not.
Hello.
Boy, I had quite a little experience in there.
That guy's got quite a problem.
People like that shouldn't be allowed in a place like this, you know.
My, what unusual pants.
They look like cowboy chaps.
They are cowboy chaps.
Yeah, I was just thinking
I thought they looked like cowboy chaps.
Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me,
I'd like to get out of these clothes.
Goodbye, it was nice talking to you.
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
BRICK:
Hello.
Mr. Vespucci?
My name is Michael Brick.
I'm with the Greybar Detective Agency.
You hired my partner a couple of hours ago...
...to get something on a Mr. Gaetano Proclo tonight.
Only my partner's sick, so I'm taking over for him.
Now, I believe you said we'd find him at the Ritz.
I just got here.
Now, what exactly did you want me to get on him, sir?
All I need is a room number with you and him in it.
That sounds easy enough, sir.
Let me see if I've got his description right.
A balding, middle-aged fat man.
That's not much to go on, Mr. Vespucci.
But I'll do my best.
One of those transvestites is standing right next to me. I'll have to...
[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
I can't talk now.
I think he's surrounding me for unnatural things.
Hey, chico, I was just going talk to you.
Hello, boys. Is he here yet?
- Who?
- Who?
What did you mean who?
There is only one "who" I'm interested in you telling me about.
Listen, Tiger, you told me there was going to be a big producer here tonight.
I dress special. I do the hairs special.
- Lf you are lying to me, Tiger...
- Hey, can't you take a little joke?
My career is no joke.
- Nobody's career is never no joke.
- We were just trying to build you up.
Listen, I tell you something, and I mean this.
You ever hear of instant laryngitis?
No producer be out there tonight.
That's what I got.
Instant laryngitis. And you and Duff are going to do the show alone.
Those are my words.
They come from the heart.
And I am now officially sick.
Come on, Tiger. Showtime.
- What do you mean?
- Googie's Mr. Big Producer just checked in.
- He's gonna be sitting poolside.
- Well, how we gonna manage that?
We're not. But with a little help from our friend here... Are you 210?
- Yeah, something like that.
- No, I meant your room.
- Oh, so did I.
- It's right this way.
- Follow us.
- Thank you.
Boy, this place is like a Chinese maze.
Just try to stay out of 105 from here on, all right?
What's in 105?
That's the room I had to pull you out of.
You could hurt somebody doing that.
Wait a minute, I thought that guy was taking me to my room.
You don't think I went in because I wanted to?
You trying to tell us he's a chubby chaser?
A chubby what?
You know. It's somebody who likes...
- You mean, like me?
- You're right up his alley.
I knew a guy like that once.
I didn't know what to call him.
"Get-Away-From-Me Claude" was all I could come up with.
Chubby chaser. Hey, that's pretty funny.
Unless you happen to be the chubby they're chasing.
Thanks for the tip.
- Now if you need anything, Mr...?
- Vespucci. Carmine vespucci.
DUFF: I'm Duff, he's Tiger.
TIGER: You just holler.
Not so fast. What about slippers?
- Slippers?
- Slippers.
Well, where do you think you are,
New York Athletic Club? Slippers.
Boy, you could catch athlete's foot in a place like this.
You're lucky if that's all you catch.
Seclusion.
A little simple seclusion.
Is that asking too much, God?
ABE [OVER P.A.]: All guest are
requested to shower before entering the poo/.
That's not us, men, it's a city ordinance.
PROCLO: Yeah?
- Are you there?
PROCLO:
Who is it?
Room service.
PROCLO:
Who?
- Go away.
CLAUDE: I've got a box of Hershey bars.
PROCLO:
I said, go away. Ow!
CLAUDE:
Peter Paul Mounds, Milky ways.
PROCLO:
Go away.
I can make you very happy.
PROCLO: I know what you are now.
You're a chubby chaser.
- I know.
PROCLO: Stop it.
- How?
- I don't know.
Are you still there?
CLAUDE [SINGING]:
Love, your magic spell lis everywhere
Someday he'll come along
The man I love
Along came... who? Who? Then along came who?
Vespucci?
[SINGING]
Vespucci
I just met a boy named vespucci
PROCLO:
Okay.
- And suddenly that name, yeah
PROCLO: All right. You win.
- Will never be...
PROCLO: You win, mister.
What?
PROCLO:
What's your room number?
- 105. All right, you go...
You go down to 105 and I'll be right there.
CLAUDE: Do you promise?
- On my mother's grave.
Get away from the door. If you're still there when I come out the whole deal is off.
Yeah, and if you're not down in my room in five minutes...
...then I'm gonna come up here and break your knees.
Don't push your luck...
...with Claude Perkins.
[MoUTHING]
Claude Perkins?
No.
No, it can't be the same one.
No, he's dead. He has to be dead.
Claude Perkins.
That's all I need now.
No.
Oh, no.
Oh, please, open up. Oh!
[DooR RATTLING]
Hey, boy, you with the key. Boy.
[IN HIGH volCE]
Hey, you boy, you with the key.
Oh, boy. You with...

My throat, I'm sorry.
Too many cigarettes, you know.
I hear the Knicks tied it up in the last quarter.
Crisco.
What?
Crisco oil party.
Crisco oil party?
Room 419. Pass it on.
Pass what on?
- Bring Joey.
- Who's Joey?
You know Joey.
Don't bring Chuck.
You got that?
Crisco oil party.
Room 419.
I can bring Joey but not Chuck.
Check.
What's the matter with Chuck?
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Chuck is definitely out.
Hey, you won't be disappointed.
PROCLO:
Okay, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Be calm.
Stay natural. Don't get hysterical.
It's just...
Haven't you ever heard anyone talk to himself before?
CHUCK:
All the time in this place.
Hey, is your name Joey?
CHUCK: It's Chuck.
- Stay away from me!
[KNOCKING]
- Excuse me.
- I'm resting.
- May I come in?
- No. No, I said, I'm resting.
- Oh, I'm looking for someone.
- No, no. I told you, I'm resting.
- That's okay, I just wanted to ask you...
- Hey.
What do you need, a brick wall to fall on your head?
Resting.
It's a euphemism for not interested, skinny.
[HUMMING]
MAN [ON TAPE RECORDER]:
Oh, I couldn't. Are you...? No.
[MAN STAMMERING]
Yes, yes, yes. Oh, yes.
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, God, yeah.

[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING
ON TAPE RECORDER]
Telephone call for Joe Namath in room 340.
That's long distance for Mr. Joe Namath, 340.
There, you see,
I knew I wasn't a crazy person.
I mean, Joe Namath.
There's no way that the man...
...who led the Jets to so many victories could be a... You know.
"Mr. Namath,
I wonder if I might have an autograph.
It's not for me, it's for my 10-year-old Gilda.
She's a big fan of yours,
Mr. Namath, and I wondered if..."
"Mr. Namath, excuse me,
I wonder if we might have an autograph.
It's not for me, it's for my..."
Mr. Namath?
[CHUCKLES]
You're not Joe Namath.
Neither are you.
- I thought you were Joe Namath.
- Oh, it's the lighting.
- I was praying you were Joe Namath.
- I don't blame you.
- I mean, you just had to be him.
- Are you eating your heart out, honey?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Join the club.
It's like some strange heterosexual gypsy curse was put on this place.
- How's the orgy room?
- I haven't...
- The steam room?
- No. No.
Well, no wonder you haven't made out.
- That's my son you've got in there.
MAN: Buzz off.
One mark on that boy's body, wanda, and I'm calling the police.
I tried. Come on, I'll show you around.
No, thanks,
I was on my way to my room.
Come on.
Hey, I don't do this sort of thing for just everybody. I'm an expert guide.
- Hey, there's something I better tell you.
- Sweetheart, relax.
You are not my type.
I just wanna help you find yours.
Hello.
We said hello.
[KNUCKLES CRACKING]
Margaret Dumont.
We thought you were dead.
There's a reason some of us don't ride the subway.
I'm looking right at it.
Is that supposed to mean me?
Screw you, honey.
If there's one thing I can't stand...
...it's a queen without a sense of humor.
Die with your secret.
Miserable piss-elegant fairy.
Dusty. What are you having?
Hey, look.
There's something I wanna tell you.
I'm afraid...
Look, I'm afraid I'm not...
BARTENDER:
There you go, Chris.
- You're not gay?
- No.
CHRIS: What are you, a social worker or something?
Hey, wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that everybody here is... Is...
Gay!
It's not such a tough word, you might try using it sometime.
- Nobody the opposite?
- I sure as hell hope not.
I didn't pay 10 bucks to walk around with Shriners.
Sorry. I didn't know what I was getting into when I came here tonight.
I am scared. I'm troubled.
I'm confused. I'm sorry.
Hey, that's okay.
You're gonna think I'm crazy, but my brother-in-law is planning to kill me.
- Man, are you putting me on?
- Boy, I wish I were.
- You picked a gay baths to hide out in?
- I didn't.
I told the cab driver to bring me to the last place anybody would look for me.
- Don't worry, you found it.
- Sure. Yeah.
And now I got a chubby chaser after me.
Why don't you just go to your room and try to get some sleep?
Sleep?
Yeah, strange as it may seem, no one is going to attack you.
Someone already has.
Beginner's luck.
Now, if you will excuse me, darling,
I'm gonna try my luck in there.
And us B girls work better solo. See you.
[IN HIGH volCE] Hello, everybody, my name is June. What's yours?
MAN:
Hi.
BRICK:
Hello.
Mr. Vespucci.
Michael Brick.
It's hard getting the goods on someone you've never seen.
No.
No one fits your description.
TIGER [wHISPERS]:
That's him.
If you need me, I'm in room 201.
TIGER:
Mr. Vespucci, the producer.
He's here again.
That transvestite.
[WHISPERS]
He?
GOOGIE:
Cuckoo.
Duff and Tiger told me who you are, Mr. Vespucci.
Yeah, well, I wish they had told me what you are.
I got a little laryngitis but the show must go on, no?
- No.
- Why not?
I don't know.
I knew there was something funny about that Gomez woman.
She's not a woman.
When I grow another head's when I'm leaving.
Vespucci. Vespucci.
I waited downstairs. You promised that you were gonna come. I waited.
Vespucci, are you coming?
Vespucci, are you coming out?
Vespucci, you... vespucci, vespucci, vespucci, you...
I waited downstairs. You didn't...
I was waiting downstairs, right down...
Excuse me. I went...
[PROCLO GASPING]
Hey, hey, hey. Oh, vespucci, vespucci...
[CRYING]
It is the same Claude Perkins.
We were in the Army together.
I thought he was dead. Why can't he be dead? It would be nice dead.
I don't like to bug producers just before they catch your act...
...so I just want to tell you one thing.
In my second number,
"Shine on Harvest Moon"...
...the orchestra and me sometimes get into different keys.
But if you know, it won't matter.
Other than that, the act is fabulous and I just know you're going to love it.
CLAUDE: Vespucci.
- Yes. I'm sure it is.
You are too guapo to be a producer.
Guapo?
Handsome.
Who, me?
Oh, come on, I'm ugly, I'm very ugly.
Ah, with a face like that, you could have been an actor.
You still could, it's never too late.
Look at Catrina valente, vicki Carr.
- Yeah, but they're real women.
GOOGIE: Oh, no.
PROCLO:
They're not?
Plastic Puerto Ricans.
I am the real thing.
You are the real thing and I knew you were in show business.
- Me?
- Oh, I knew I'd seen you someplace.
I was in the Cleveland Little Theater
Masque and Mummer's...
...spring production of Sound Of Music...
...but I wouldn't call that show business.
- Oh, yes? What part?
It was really more of a walk-on.
GOOGIE:
I was in that show.
PROCLO: You were in The Sound of Music?
GOOGIE: Oh, sure.
Where was this?
Broadway. The mainstream, where else?
- The original cast?
- Oh!
I was more original than anyone else in it.
They fired me the first day of rehearsal, those bastards.
They said I wasn't right for the part.
What part was that?
Oh, one of those fucking Trapp kids.
But you know what the real reason was, mister?
They found out what you really were.
No.
Seymour Pippin.
Who?
Oh, shit.
Seymour Pippin.
He was the company manager.
If there is one man that I was born to kill with my own two hands...
...it's Seymour Pippin.
But I fix them.
I picket that show until they was crazy.
I picket. I picket. I picket.
I picket that show every night until I got a part in Camelot.
[STEAM HISSING]
- You were in Camelot too?
- Oh, sure.
Oh, boy. That's a wonderful show.
It's a piece of shit.
- They fired you from that one too, huh?
- Sure, they fire me.
What did you expect? Thanks to Seymour
Pippin, I get fired from everything.
- I can't imagine why.
- Oh, yeah?
You see this face? It's a curse.
All right. Come on, keep away from me.
GOOGIE: Don't fight it.
- Believe me, you won't be happy.
I won't be happy.
You're making a big mistake.
- I am suddenly all woman.
- No, you're not.
- You're someone with a lot of problems.
- Aye, make me feel like a real woman.
That's not my department.
That's out of my hands.
GOOGIE: Kiss me.
- Come on.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Oh, shit.
TIGER: Let's go, Googie, we're on.
DUFF: Fuck.
GOOGIE:
Come on, my Mr. Big Producer.
You're going to love my show.
I got you the best seat. I seat you ringside.
- We save the hanky-pank for later, huh?
- Hanky-pank, what?
Googie is going to straighten you out between shows.
- Oh, what room are you in?
- 210. I mean, 201.
- One.
- I be there, chico.
Thanks a million for helping us out like this, Mr. Vespucci.
[DISCO MUSIC PLAYING]
Wanna dance?
- What?
- Dance.
PROCLO: Dance?
- Forget it.
If I ever get my hands on the cab driver that brought me here, he's finished.
Is this taken?
MAN:
No.
CARMINE:
Stay here. Don't let nobody in.
[DISCO MUSIC PLAYING]
MAN:
And now, on the great Ritz stage...
...direct from her bus-and-truck tour with Fiddler On The Roof...
...the sensational Googie Gomez with Duff and Tiger...
...those amazing, now-you-see-it, now-you-don't, golden go-go boys.
Here's Duff.
[RIM SHoT]
Here's Tiger.
[RIM SHOT]
And here's Googie.
[BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING]
[SINGING]
[APPLAUSE]
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
And now...
...I would like you to meet someone very special to me.
A man who... what can I say?
If I say it in Spanish you won't understand me.
Ladies and gentlemen, one of the all-time great producers...
...Mr. Carmine vespucci.
[APPLAUSE]
GOOGIE:
And now, a salute to Cole Porter.
[SINGING]
ABE [o vER P.A.]:
We have an urgent telephone call...
... for somebody called Wally
at the front office.
That's all they said,
someone called Wally.
Jesus Christ.
Good evening.
Huh?
I said, good evening.
Well, just watch your step, Mac.
Well, I just said good evening.
CARMINE:
Are you in there, Brick?
It's vespucci. Don't open.
I don't want anyone to see.
If you can hear me, knock once.
If you can't, knock twice.
BRICK:
"Knock once."
CARMINE:
Are you there, Brick?
[KNOCKS ONCE]
Good, our signals are working.
Now listen to me.
Have you seen that balding, fat slob brother-in-law of mine yet?
[KNOCKS TWlCE]
What does that mean, no?
[KNOCKS ONCE]
Okay, I think I read you.
Now...
...I know he's around here somewhere.
What I don't know is how you could miss him. He's a house. Wait a minute.
Somebody's coming.
Forget it.
Listen, Brick. None of these fruits tried to pull anything with you, did they?
[KNOCKS ONCE]
Oh, my God.
I'll make it up to you.
Meet me in room 224 in 15 minutes.
Knock three times. Got that?
[KNOCKS THREE TIMES]
Not now, stupid, then.
You don't have to worry about him leaving this place.
Leaving in one piece, I mean.
I got all my men waiting for him.
Ain't that great, Brick, huh?
[KNOCKS ONCE]
I knew you'd like that.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
MAN:
Stay with us. There she goes.
Yeah.
CLAUDE:
Vespucci.
- Vespucci.
- Aah!
Wait, vespucci, wait a minute.
Hold on. Hold on. Wait.
PROCLO:
Go away.
Go away. Get off.
[CLATTERING]
Leave me alone.
[CLAUDE AND
PROCLO GRUNTING]
[GOOGIE SQUEALING]
[GIGGLING]
[GOOGIE SCREAMS]
TIGER:
Sorry, Googie.
[APPLAUSE]
[SHOUTING IN SPANISH]
This way... vespucci.
Where is this skinny little man who ruined my act?
I kill him.
[CHATTERING IN SPANISH]
CLAUDE:
Vespucci.
Vespucci.
Vespucci.
[CLAUDE LAUGHING]
TIGER: Googie, wait.
You can't go in there.
You think I don't know what goes on in this place?
All of you men going:
"Hee, hee, hee!
Poo, poo, poo! Ha, ha, ha!"
TIGER:
Googie, no.
[GOOGIE SHOUTING IN SPANISH]
MAN:
Ow!
[CLAUDE SCREAMING]
CLAUDE: You could use a good psychiatrist, mister.
- What did you call me?
- He didn't mean it.
Tell her you're sorry.
CLAUDE: I haven't seen such tacky drag since the Princeton varsity show.
- Tacky drag?
CLAUDE: Thirty years ago, Sonny boy.
[SCREAMING IN SPANISH]
[CLAUDE GRUNTING]
I'm going straight.
Were you in there for all that?
You don't wanna talk about it?
- Why are you wearing your clothes?
PROCLO: I'm going to Central Park.
CHRIS: For somebody who's never been in a place like this...
...you're certainly getting around.
[WHIRRING]
CHRIS: I thought you were gonna stay in your room.
PROCLO:
I can't.
Tiger and Duff told Googie
I was Carmine vespucci.
Claude thinks I'm Carmine vespucci.
Everybody thinks I'm Carmine vespucci.
CHRIS: Who are you?
PROCLO: Carmine vespucci.
BRICK:
Are you Mr. Carmine vespucci, sir?
Hello, kid, you got a light?
Are you him, Mr. Vespucci?
- Say yes. Say yes.
- Yes.
I'm Michael Brick.
My room's right up there.
I'm Chris.
My room is right up there too.
BRICK:
Hi, Chris, how are you?
[CHRIS CHUCKLES]
[PHONE RINGS]
[SCREAMS]
Now.
This is what I thought we'd do.
Get under the bed.
- Another one.
- All right, stay there. Stay there.
Now, we pretend that you're him and I'm me...
...and the real you is under the bed.
Only this one's the worst.
Sit down, Mr. Vespucci.
Now, get the picture.
The lights are low.
He's moving down the hallway...
...when finally he sees me.
I'm leaning against the door.
I put one knee up.
I flex.
I've caught his eye.
I wink.
I kind of beckon with my head.
And finally, I speak.
See something you like, buddy?
I'm resting.
That's the tough-guy approach.
Is that your real voice?
- Why? Does it bother you?
- No. No. No.
- Some people find it very irritating.
- I can't image why.
Me either.
Of course, I'm used to it.
I've had it ever since I was a kid.
I mean, I grew up and matured.
Only, my voice didn't.
- Where was I?
- The tough-guy approach.
- Oh! And then...
- I'm having a nightmare.
- This is where you jump out.
You see, I'm not queer.
Boy, you could have fooled me.
BRICK: So you're gonna have to help me find your brother-in-law, Mr. Vespucci.
What? My brother-in-law?
I can't find anyone who fits Mr. Proclo's description.
- Who are you?
- Michael Brick.
- What are you?
- A detective.
[ALARM BUZZING]
Quick, it's time. Get under the bed.
For what?
BRICK: I left a note by the Coke machine saying:
"Any middle-aged, fat, balding man whose initials are G. P...
...interested in a good time, should meet me here at midnight sharp."
Just leave everything to me.
I'm right on top of you.
I can't tell you how comforting that is.
ABE [o vER P.A.]:
Anyone interested in forming...
...a Ritz softball team, contact Howard.
MAN: I'm resting.
[KNOCKS]
CARMINE:
I said knock three times.
Oh, he's being masterful with me already, the brute.
CARMINE: That's more like it.
- I think I'm in love. Hi.
[CHRIS GRUNTS
THEN CLATTERING]
Ow.
CARMINE:
Hey, let me get a look at you.
[CHUCKLES]
I'm no judge of fruit bait, but you'll do.
Oh, let's just cool it, sweetheart.
This is not the Meat Rack, huh?
You can can the fag act with me, Brick.
Now listen, I think I've come up with something.
This sounds like the oldest stunt in the book...
...but I'm gonna hide under your bed.
On the contrary, that's a first for me.
You never tried the under-the-bed technique?
Well, not till recently.
- What kind of a detective are you?
- Now, that's a good question, honey.
Can it, Brick. Just can it.
One thing I don't like is a wise guy.
The only thing I don't like more is a queer wise guy.
I'm calling the shots now, and I'm getting under your bed.
- Uh, where am I supposed to be?
- On top of it, stupid.
Oh, that sounds fabulous. What then?
You know.
Do what you have to do.
- What's that?
- How should I know?
Wiggle your fanny.
Shake your towel in his face.
- Whose face?
- My brother-in-law's, you dummy.
The guy I hired you to catch.
Then I pop out, catching you both in the act of fragrant delicto...
...and, wham, we got him.
- Your brother-in-law.
Who else?
Jesus, you're like talking to a yo-yo.
- Dumb and dizzy, that's me, darling.
- Jesus!
Listen, that's just a little more of that gay humor.
All right, all right, all right.
Now...
...you go back to 201.
Hey, wait a minute.
- No. Not yet.
- No.
When you get there...
...you whistle like this:
[WHISTLES]
I hightail it to your room, slide under...
...and we're in business, got that?
- Check.
- It's about time.
- Only I can't whistle.
Goddamn it, you can't whistle either?
I thought all dicks could whistle.
Just "Stormy weather."
Look, I tell you what, Mr...
- vespucci. Carmine vespucci.
- Carmine vespu... only don't call me that.
He might hear us.
- I need a code name.
- Evelyn.
[SIGHS]
No, I don't like Evelyn.
It sounds...
...effeminate.
How about Bunny?
Bunny's good.
Bunny, you get under this bed.
That way, I won't have to whistle...
...and you won't have to hightail it to 201.
Hey, maybe you're not so dumb after all, Brick.
Hey, hey, hey.
I'll tell you...
I'll tell you one thing, with Papa gone now...
Papa!
[CRYING]
I ain't sharing no vespucci Sanitation
Services and Enterprises Inc. With no fairy.
- Your brother-in-law's a fairy?
- He's gonna be.
- What are you gonna do?
- Kill him.
Oh, good.
You know what a delitto di passione is,
Brick?
It's a crime of passion.
An enraged brother...
...catching his dear, sweet sister's balding, fat, slob husband...
...in an unnatural act with one of these fruitcakes from around here.
[LAUGHING]
There ain't no court in the country that would convict.
Twenty years I waited for this night, Brick.
You're looking at a man of great and terrible passions.
- Well, I can see that, Bunny.
CARMINE: What happened?
That's how you do it around here.
Now get under this bed.
CARMINE: Yeah.
- Yeah, go ahead. Get under the bed.
I'll leave this door open, you see, so he can come in.
Go ahead. I'll be right up here on top.
- Now, shh. Don't say another word now.
CARMINE: Right.
ABE [OVER P.A.]: Tonight's
double feature in our mini cinema...
... is All About Eve
and A Star Is Born.
Hey, you know any good stories?
- As a matter of fact, I do, sir.
- Skip it.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
That must be him.
Hold your horses, stud.
It's open.
Oh.
BRICK:
See something you like, buddy?
You've gotta be kidding.
False alarm, Mr. Vespucci.
CHRIS: Where is your friend?
- He's under the bed.
Why not? Everybody else is.
I always wondered what you straight guys did together.
Oh, now that I know,
I'm so glad I'm gay.
Oh, yeah, that brother-in-law of yours, that maniac?
- Yeah. He's just down the hall.
- What?
- And he's got a gun.
- What?
Now he's after you, Mr. Vespucci.
You didn't mention anything about a gun.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
CHRIS:
That's him.
- I'm scared.
- You're scared? Move over.
- No room.
- I can fit.
- I was here first.
- It's my brother-in-law.
- It's my ass.
PROCLO:
Answer the door.
- Where you going?
- It's not him.
- Who is it?
- It's that transvestite again.
What are you talking about?
Oh, hello.
- Who's there?
GOOGIE: I know you're in there, chico.
- Now, look.
- Shh!
Don't speak. Don't say nothing.
Say one word, then Googie is out on her ass.
She is breaking every book in the rule doing this.
Do you know why you don't like women?
Because you never try it, that's all.
Or maybe you try it and that's why.
She was a bad woman.
Forget her. Believe me, chico.
It don't hurt. It's nice.
You just lay back there, and Googie is going to show you how nice.
- Look, I'd like to help you out...
- All right, all right. Shh.
Think...
...of a tropical night.
Think...
...of a beach.
What "bitch"?
The moon is shining on the sea.
And in the distance, over the waves, you hear music.
[SINGING]
[GOOGIE, CHRIS
AND BRICK SINGING]
This is not gonna work, Mr. Googie.
- Mr. Googie?
- There's just no way.
Mr. Googie?
You thought I was a drag queen?
No such luck, chico.
You mean to tell me that you're really a miss?
This is all real.
Yeah, they feel real.
I just hope I'm going to find me some huevitos.
- What are huevitos?
- These.
- Oh!
- Aye!
- Oh, chico.
- Oh, no.
They're real too.
I know we're going to make such whoopee together, chico.
- No, there's one thing wrong.
- Yes.
My brother-in-law's out to kill and somebody's under this bed.
Oh, no, you don't. I'm not falling for that old hat-and-dance routine.
You're not pulling no wool over my ears so easy.
I swear to God there is.
- Never try to shit an old pro, chico.
BRICK: He's not.
There is someone under this bed.
Us. If you wanna bounce around up there,
I'll gladly go back to my own room.
That is a rotten stunt, mister.
I could lose my job for this.
I throw the whole wind into the caution to come here.
- Look, I can explain every...
- I don't need no explain.
You would rather make:
Hee, hee, hee, poo, poo, poo, ha, ha, ha...
...with that maric髇 you got hiding under the bed.
- Two maric髇s, Googie.
- Who's that down there?
CHRIS:
It's me, Chris.
Oh, hi, Chris.
What are you doing down there?
- I wish I knew.
- You lose something?
BRICK:
See, the reason we're under this bed...
You. Not only do you got a fat boyfriend, you maric髇 hump, you got a mean one.
I'm not his boyfriend and I'm not gay.
With a voice like that, you're no straight arrow neither.
I was born with this voice.
So was Yma Sumac.
[PROCLO GRUNTING]
Where do you think you're going?
I'm just someone in a lot of trouble, see.
You're not staying for my second show?
I am not a producer.
It was your two friends' idea.
Wait a...
Hey.
- Wait a minute.
- Hmm?
- Seymour Pippin.
- Who?
You don't fire Googie Gomez from no show and get away with it, you bastard.
You think I forget your face?
I'm gonna tear all of your eyes out.
That's Mr. Vespucci.
- You promise?
- I promise.
Oh, what do you know?
I thought it was Seymour Pippin.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR
THEN GOOGIE GASPS]
It's for you.
BRICK: If it's him, Mr. Vespucci, you just give me... what the hell happened to you?
You said you'd be on top.
I've been under that damn bed so long
I can hardly walk.
- See something you like, buddy?
CARMINE: What the...?
You looking for a good time, Mac?
You're not Brick. Where's Brick?
What have you done to him?
Lie down.
Get your hands off me.
[BED SPRINGS RATTLING]
- Somebody's under there.
- Just lie down and stretch out on the bed.
CARMINE: What are you doing?
BRICK: I'm trying to seduce you.
CARMINE: Get your hands off,
I'll lay your head open.
BRICK: Is it him, Mr. Vespucci?
CARMINE: Yes.
Vespucci? I'm vespucci.
BRICK: Is it?
PROCLO: Yes, it's him, it's him.
I know that voice. What the hell is this?
One of them goddamn "transvestitites," sure you are.
Seymour Pippin.
I kill you, pendejo.
I tear your eyes out.
You think you can fire Googie Gomez from a show...
...and get away with it, you bastard?
[GOOGIE SHOUTING IN SPANISH]
Hey, fight fair, you faggot.
You lay one hand on her, Mr. Proclo, and I'm gonna break...
- Proclo? Proclo?
- Get him, for chrissake.
Step aside, miss.
[GIBBERING]
[SQUEALING]
[GLASS SHATTERING]
PROCLO:
Get me out of here, will you?
Oh, we were just starting to have such fun.
Hey, do you know something?
This man is not Seymour Pippin neither.
- I wonder who he is?
- It's my brother-in-law.
[GASPS]
- Is he in show business?
- No, he's in garbage.
A gay garbage man?
I'm a detective.
Mr. Vespucci here hired me...
...to get something on his brother-in-law,
Mr. Proclo here.
So that Mr. Proclo won't inherit half of the family business.
So that's it.
GOOGIE: Amigo.
- I'll kill...
GOOGIE:
No, no, no.
Mr. Vespucci wanted to catch
Mr. Proclo and I together...
...so that he could commit
a delitto di passione.
- Look out now, you'll be in the picture.
- Oh, picture. What picture?
Hey. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
I see what you do.
If that man want to be here, let him be here.
What do you care?
Listen, I don't stand still for no blackmail.
I tell Tiger and Duff what you do and you are on your ass, big boy.
And I thought you were nice.
Come on, Chris.
I still like Evelyn.
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thank you.
Can't you hit him again?
Oh, come on now, Mr. Vespucci, that wouldn't be ethical.
Ethical?
Your line of work and you're telling me what's ethical? Come on.
Well, you really blew it this time,
Carmine.
By the time you get out of this place,
I'll be in Cleveland with vivian and the kids.
Fat man in 201. Come and get it.
He's all yours.
Fat man in 201. Come and get it.
He's all yours.
Fat man in 201.
Fat man in 201.
[PHoNE RINGS]
Come and get it.
Hello?
I'll fix you. You'll get nowhere without your clothes.
- Come and get it.
BRICK: Michael Brick speaking.
Fat man in 201.
BRICK:
I'll see if I can find him.
- It's for you, Mr. Vespucci.
PROCLO: Who is it?
Who is this, please?
It's Mrs. Proclo calling from a bar across the street.
Shh. Mrs. Proclo?
My God, that's vivian.
Tell her I left.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Proclo, but he just left.
She doesn't believe me.
Tell her she has to believe you.
He says you have to believe me, Mrs...
She says she's coming over now.
Nothing's gonna stop her.
She's putting on a man's hat and coat.
Hello?
- I didn't even get to tell her the good news.
- What good news?
We got our man.
MAN:
I'm sorry, mister, but you can't... oh! Ow! Ooh.
MAN:
You take the next one, will you?
[CLAUDE MOANING]
I'm giving you one more chance.
I don't know about you, Claude.
I'm in desperate...
- Did you say Claude?
- I never said that.
- Wait a minute. What...?
- No.
- Guy. Guy. It's you, Guy.
- Absolutely no.
Gaetano Proclo. The 5th division, special services, the Philippines.
I was 4-F. I never served.
No, no. It's me, Claude. Claude Perkins.
Get away from me, Claude.
That's right. Get-Away-From-Me Claude.
[GRUNTS]
We had an act together.
A trio with Nelson Carpenter.
We pantomimed to Andrews Sisters' records, remember? "Rum And Coca-Cola."
[SINGING]
The Andrews Sisters?
I hate the Andrews Sisters.
You hate the Andrews Sisters?
Look, mister, I'm in desperate trouble and I wish you'd leave. Now get out.
Wait till I write Nelson Carpenter about this.
ABE [OVER P.A.]:
313 coming up. That is 313.
You're not gonna believe what's coming up, boys.
It's vivian.
There are other fat fish in the ocean,
Gaetano Proclo.
And 313 may just be one of them.
Not 313, Claude. Don't touch 313.
Just not 313, Claude.
[PHONE RINGING
IN DISTANCE]
Oh, I had a hunch it would be bad but nothing like this.
- Welcome to the city morgue.
- Aah!
Oh, forget it, mister.
That is not my scene.

CLAUDE:
Looking for 313?
Right this way.
[CLAUDE STAMMERING]

Just lie there like a beached whale.
Look, I'd love to stay here and play Sleeping Beauty with you...

Oh, well, you can say that again.
Brick.
Oh, hi, there, Bunny. How's tricks?
Hey, listen, is that thing loaded?
You're lucky I'm not using it on you.
Where is he?
- Who?
- My brother-in-law, dick.
He was just here.
- And?

All right, get out of here.
Get out of here.

They molested my sister.
Oh, you crazy fairies, I'm gonna kill you.
I'll kill every last one of you.
Where are you?
No. No.
[MUSIC PLAYING

- Your brother-in-law means business.
- What do you think I'm doing here?
CHRIS: You just gonna sit there?
- What's the use?
Well, wear a disguise.
I am. I thought you were mad at me.
I am, but I prefer you alive to dead.
I'm funny that way.
- Claude.
- Oh, sure, now you know me.
PROCLO:
You gotta help me.
I am entered in a talent contest.
I've gotta get ready.
My brother-in-law is here with a gun.
DSo that's who that maniac was.

- What is it?
- My mink.
- Your mink?
- They've taken it.
Now, here's the plan.
You've gotta be Nelson Carpenter.
- Who?
- One of the Andrews Sisters.
Nelson Carpenter was one of the Andrews Sisters?
It's a routine.
I don't know any Andrews Sisters' routine.
Neither did he.
Nelson and I carried you.
It'll never work.
[CARMINE GRUNTING
THEN CLAUDE SQUEALS]

Jesus, I can't believe it.
A good-Iooking, rugged boy like you.
- Believe what, sir?
- I believe it. Get going.
Come on.
VIVIAN:
Carmine, please.
CARMINE:
You shut up too, vivian.
I just want my mink.
You'll get your mink.
Will you let me handle this?
He's in here somewhere.
JOEY:
Wait a minute.
All this because some fat woman who lost her mink?
One more word out of you, you transvestitite... what did you call me?
Careful, Googie.
You make me see red, mister.
And when I see red, I tear you apart.
Shit. You think I'm scared of a little gun?
BELICIC AND HUGSNY
NoT HUGGING]
That's okay, mister.
If you don't bother me,
I don't bother you.
CARMINE: All right, the rest of you in there. Get in there.
Come on, in there.
Come on, get in there.
Get in there, all of you.
CARMINE:
All right, pool time, everybody.
Come on, everybody. Come on. Come on.
You listen to me, idiots.
Seniors. I don't wanna see a dry fairy in the house.
MAN 1:
Oh, my mascara's running.
MAN 2: Oh, God!
MAN 3: It's running.
MAN 1: What a night!
MAN 2: My leg...
Christ, another one.
You really know how to mess up an act, you know that, mister?
- You know what they call people like you?
- Fashionable.
- Get in there. Get in there.
- All right, all right.
Well, I guess that makes it you.
Look at you!
I could vomit.
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph, is that her mink?
- Yeah.
CARMINE: All right, give it back.
VIVIAN: I don't want it.
That's not my Gaetano.
I wanna go home.
- Okay, Gaetano, the jig's up.
- All right.
Take the crap off.
The wig, the glasses, the moustache, the mink. Everything.
Okay.
I want you all to meet my splendid brother-in-law, Gaetano Proclo.
That's not Mr. Proclo. He is.
- Who is?
- You are.
Who? Who?
[CARMINE GRUNTING]
PROCLO:
Keep it quiet.
I don't wanna hear that voice.
[VIVIAN CRYING]
Don't cry, viv.
"Don't cry," he says.
Look at him like that, telling me not to cry.
Do you want your coat back?
Oh, look at my husband, the man in the mink coat.
Oh, I can't wait to go to bingo with you like that next week.
But I won't be there, if God is merciful...
...because I'm gonna have a heart attack here.
This is grounds for annulment, sis.
I asked Father Catini.
I don't want an annulment, I wanna die.
[CHATTERING IN ITALIAN]
Vivian. Vivian, what are you doing?
You can't even swim. Don't.
Well...
...is this what you wanted, Carmine?
Boy, I can understand you hating me as a brother-in-law...
...but killing someone over a garbage company?
[CHATTERING IN ITALIAN]
You're married to a flaming homo, that's perche...
[CHATTERING IN ITALIAN]
- He came here tonight, didn't he?
- A cab driver brought me here.
Because you told him to.
I never heard of this place.
You see that, vivian? Even a cab driver knows what a fata he is.
I just hope you're not gonna insist on mentioning this in confession.
For my sake, for the children, please, don't tell about this.
I wasn't planning to.
It's just a phase you're going through.
Last year, it was miniature golf.
How the hell do you prove something like this to your own wife?
Okay, Carmine, I give up. You win.
Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.
Get off of me.
PROCLO:
Don't splash. Don't splash.
CARMINE: Get out of here, you pest. Get out of here.
- Let's get out of here.
- Vivian, wait.
Don't you even speak to my sister.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Thirty-seven thousand, five hundred on the week.
The rain killed us tonight, and next week we got the Jewish holidays coming up.
Well, good night, boss.
Who is that?
Oh, it was just a person.
- She called you "boss."
- A lot of people call me boss.
It's not what you're gonna think, vivian.
"Vespucci Enterprises, Inc.
Carmine vespucci, president."
- This is a statement.
- I was gonna tell you about it.
VIVIAN: We own this place?
- Papa done a lot of expanding.
We own this place, Guy.
He don't have to know.
This isn't the place to talk about it.
You knew what kind of place this was all the time.
CARMINE:
So did he. That's why he came here.
I can't help it if we own it.
It was just a coincidence.
- What kind of a cab did you come in?
- What?
What kind of a cab did you come in?
- It was the opera. Aida Cab.
- Aida Cab.
- We own that company.
- We do?
What did the driver look like, Guy?
- All I remember about him is his stutter.
- His stutter?
- Yeah, he stuttered and smoked pot.
- Cousin Tito.
I should have guessed.
It's gonna be very hard to forgive you for this.
I don't want no forgiving.
VIVIAN: Take the hit off of him, Carmine.
- Vivian!
- Take it off.
- No.
If you don't, I'm gonna tell Frankie...
...about you muscling in on the bingo at the feast of St. Anthony's.
And he is gonna put a hit out on you and you're gonna be wearing cement shoes.
There's gonna be more grief and less peace in our fucking family than there already is.
- "Get Proclo." You heard Papa.
- I got Proclo. Now, take it off, Carmine.
I'll lose face.
- Not under the East River.
- Shit!
Now, I wanna see you two forgive each other.
[SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]
[PROCLO SCOFFING]
I wouldn't kiss him for a million dollars.
That's exactly what's it's worth, Guy.
- I wouldn't kiss him, period.
- For me. For me.
- Kiss. Kiss him.
- Hmm?
MAN 1: Yeah.
MAN 2: Kiss him.
MAN 3:
Come on, kiss.
Hey.
VIVIAN:
Kiss him, Carmine.
[STAMMERING]
PROCLO: Hey.
MAN 1: Hey.
MAN 2: Hey.
MAN 3: Hey.
MEN:
Hey!
[CARMINE SCREAMS
THEN GRUNTS]
[MEN CHEERING]
You can go
fangoo/ yourself, Carmine.
It's people like you that belong in garbage.
It's people like me that just marry into it.
Get him out of here, men.
Into the steam room, girls.
[MEN SINGING]
CARMINE:
Hey, don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Hey, you get your hands off me.
ABE [o vER P.A.]:
Okay, everybody.
Tonight's talent contest has been won
by Claude Perkins and partners.
TIGER:
We're sorry, Googie.
You build someone up like that and it's all a lie.
That is a low-down, dirty trick you've made.
Hey, do you believe that?
They told me
Mr. Big was going to be here tonight.
Who's Mr. Big?
Who's Mr. Big?
Only the man who produces miracles.
A producer, who else?
- My uncle's a producer, Miss Gomez.
- Oh, yeah?
- What's he produce?
- Shows.
Legitimate shows?
I don't do no dirty stuff.
Right now, I think he's casting Oklahoma for a dinner theater.
Oklahoma.
It's a stretch, but I could do that part.
Listen, you could get me an audition with him?
- Oh, sure thing.
- Oh, good.
I tell you what,
I see you in Bimbi's across the street.
We run into my boyfriend, Hector, we tell him you're my agent.
I see you two skunks later.
I thought you quit.
That's show business.
You really got an uncle who's in show business?
Seymour Pippin. He's a producer.
Forget it, mister. Come on, Tiger.
CHRIS: I suppose you're wondering what happened to Bunny.
Entered her in the
Princess Margaret look-alike contest.
First prize is a gay guide to Leningrad.
We also called the 16th Precinct, they'll be right over for him.
Hey, listen.
Thanks for helping me tonight.
Oh, you just let me know the next time you three are coming in.
I wanna be sure not to be here.
If you're ever in Cleveland, vivian makes a great lasagna.
That's the best offer I've had all night.
- Who was he talking about?
- Carmine.
Oh, you gotta do something for him.
Don't worry, I will.
VIVIAN: Promise me?
- On Papa's grave.
[SOBBING]
Papa.
PROCLO:
Not your papa's, mine.
Oh.
VIVIAN:
Come on, Guy, let's go.
Don't tell me what...
Get out of here.
I wanna know... Look, I got friends...
I walk in off the street, a guy pulls a... we'll go together.
Hey, listen, I'm not a gay.
Watch the hair.
Come on, listen, will you guys?
I got a wife and two kids.
PROCLO:
Oh, no.
Viv, I've left my wallet in there.
CHRIS: Orgy, orgy.
They'll be an orgy in 340.

Hey
Tonight's the night everything is gonna go
Hey, hey, brother man,
I'm a little worried about you.
You're soundin' nervous.
Who, me, Sam? Nervous?
Hey, well, this is my first time going on live on the radio, you know?
Yeah, and it may be your last, sucker.
Hey, don't say that, man.
Well, if you blow this, baby, you'd better be gettin' your hat.
Listen here, man, you know, after tonight's gig... the whole town is gonna be talkin' about Bobby Speed.
Yeah, man, sure, that's cool.
But what about The Commodores?
We go live at 12:00.
Hey, listen, man.
When I, Bobby Speed... promises his audience live music, he delivers.
You'd better, turkey.
Or you'll be back at the supermarket... announcin' specials.
Ok, we go in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
Hit it!
Hey, hey, y'all.
This is Bobby Speed, the man in the glass booth... comin' to you live for the first time, definitely not the last... from the Zoo Disco, over station K.D.C.O.
Where you are what you hear.
Who's that dancin' by the mirror?
She's been dancin' all night long.
Do you love it?
Oh, we love it, we love it.
Don't we, Frannie?
The straps are fallin' down.
Oh, Frannie, don we love it?
Frannie?
- Oh, fabulous.
- Yes.
If y'all are anyplace but right here,
You're in the wrong place, baby.
I feel like a stilt walker.
No wonder my sister has rotten feet.
- I'm takin' them off.
- No, no, I'll fix it, ok?
Don't forget, y'all... big dance contest tonight.
The Commodores, live.
$200, first prize.
Be here at the Zoo.
Ok, how does it feel?
Fabulous.
Frannie, it's better than breaking your ankle.
Now, come on, you can't win a dance contest if you...
Jeannie, there's no guarantee I'll win.
You will. You will.
You are the best dancer in taft high.
Jeannie, that's kids.
This is different.
Oh, why did I let you talk me into this?
Look, how else are we going to pay... for the kiss concert?
We can't miss that.
I mean, do you want to go through life... with this hanging over your head?
No.
Ok.
It's a chevy.
Beige, 4-door.
Got you.
This was a perfect anniversary dinner, Dave.
Oh, I'm glad.
Hey, did you really like the present?
You know, it's hard coming up with something in wood.
All I could think of... was a pepper mill or a baseball bat.
We'll go home.
Since you're drunk,
I'll take advantage of you.
What do you suppose is going on over there?
Oh, it's, uh, just one of those discos or something.
Let's go.
What?
Take the car back, please.
But... but...
Wait a second. Hold it.
Susan, it's, uh... it's after 10:00.
I have to go to work tomorrow.
Dave, tonight's special.
And I don't want to go home yet.
Take it back.
Ho. Hey, hold it. Hold it.
Susan, I do not want to stand on line... with a bunch of freaks and listen to loud music.
All right, take it back.
I'll pick it up later.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Here.
A half hour.
One dance, a slow dance, and then we go home.
Jennifer.
Oh, God, I'll hold them, Maddy, but how can you eat this.
How can you eat at a time like this?
I'm sorry, but I just had to eat something.
I can't believe it took so long.
Don't be sorry.
The entire world has got to be goin' tonight, Jennifer.
I mean, do you know what this means?
The odds for meeting guys moves way up.
You want a bite of this?
No, thanks.
Maddy, do you think what I'm wearin' is ok?
I mean I haven't gotten those clothes from home yet.
And I feel really funny.
- Do you think it's ok.
- Yeah, it's great.
Well I mean, it's great.
I mean, it doesn't matter because...
I mean, the thing about discotheques, Jennifer, is you can just be anything.
You can just look any way, you can just be any... it fantastic.
I gotta stop eating this crap.
I really want to thank you for taking me with you tonight.
I mean, really.
Forget it. I mean I know when you come to a new place,
You just can't find people you can relate to.
Relate to...
I just would like to meet one nice guy.
I go to the discotheques to kind of forget, you know?
They're a great place to meet new guys.
Yeah? Like, what kind of men go there?
Live ones.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Maddy, I'm sorry.
I knew that was gonna.
I'm really sorry.
- Oh, no, it'll dry.
- I'm sorry.
I mean, not tonight, you know, but it'll dry.
Here. I'm sorry. I'll get it out.
Oh, oh I knew that would come in handy.
Oh, your bun. I'm sorry.
What the hell is this?
Smog.
Here.
The wheel.
Whoa!
Put on your glasses right now.
I can see.
Don't worry I can see.
That's it, I'm gettin' out of this...
No, no, don't!
Hold the wheel.
I'll put them on, I'll put them on.
Hey, hey... don't be afraid of bumpin' and jumpin'.
That's what it's all about.
Let yourself go.
Turn off your mind and boogie.
I'm with you, baby.
This is guaranteed to paralyze you. Here.
Hey, would you loosen up, huh?
Huh?
Would you watch the road, huh?
Hey, come on, man.
We are out for action tonight.
You don't understand.
I don't want the action.
I'm not looking for action.
What I want is a nice girl.
Me, too. One nice girl.
Nice tits, nice ass. Nice.
Friday
Thank God, it's
Friday
Friday
Thank God, it's
Friday, Friday
Friday, Friday
Gorgeous.
Hey, put a smile on your face
Things are coming your way
Out there somewhere tonight
It is the right time and place
Any problems?
Nothing I can't handle.
They're really coming out of the woodwork for the dance contest.
- Any V.I.P's?
- No, not yet.
Baby
Here comes one.
Here comes one.
- Hi.
- Hey, babe. How you doing?
- Come on in.
- Neat. Thanks.
Hi.
Who the hell is she?
Oh, it's ok.
She's with me.
Oh, wow! Nice car.
I told you we'd arrive in style.
Where you girls headed?
Right here. Right here!
Right... no turn. Right here!
- Where?
- Turn!
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
"In style". Huh.
Fabulous.
Hey!
Hey, sweetheart, you want a ride?
Look where you're goin', schmuck. The post!
Would you watch where you're goin'?
Did you see those two?
- Those two what?
- Girls! Didn't you see'em?
Am I near the parkin' lot?
Left, left. Make a left.
Put on your glasses.
What are you, my mother?
I had them on.
Don't push.
I think this will be exciting.
Hey, do you really want to go in?
Why don't we go home and watch TV or something?
Dave, it's good for us to experience new things.
We have to reach out together, be more open to things.
Oh, God, you've been read
Cosmopolitan again.
From here to eternity
She does, she does, she does, she does
From here to eternity
That's where she leads me
From here to eternity
Mr. Demarco, this thing is just hot and sweaty.
I pay you to look like a monkey... and run the elevator.
Not one or the other.
But this thing is just scratchy and...
I'm breakin' out all over.
Did I leave my green sweat in your apartment?
- Was that yours?
- Yes... and you still owe me a dinner, too.
Well, let's make a date.
Give me a call.
Hi, Tony.
Am I gonna see you later?
- What do you think, sweetheart?
- Well I hope so.
How about Monday?
It's my birthday. Did you remember?
Of course I remembered.
I even got you a lovely green sweater.
Oh, Tony, you didn't have to.
I know.
- See you later.
- See you later.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Have a nice time, girls.
That'll be $10.
$10? For what?
For what?
For a good time.
What's that?
What was that for?
Look what he did.
You gotta have it.
You can't get in and out without it.
- He ruined my shirt.
- It'll wash out.
What if it doesn't?
This is my best shirt. $40.
Pierre Cardin.
Just wait here.
Dave.
I want to try and wash it out.
Oh, Dave.
Doth with their death bury their parents' strife
The fearful passage of their death marked love
And the continuance of their parents' rage
Which, but their children's end, naught could remove
Is now the two hours' traffic
Of our stage
The which if you with patient ears attend
It won't come off!
I'll get it out. I promise.
We both care
Nothing is enough for your love
And it's so wonderful
Being caught up in your love
Take my all 'cause I have so much
When you are here with me, love
You, you, you started the fire
You, you, you lit my desire
You, you, you turn me on higher
Nothing is enough for your love
Your love
Nothing is enough for your love
Ooh, sweet love
Hey, nothing is enough for your love
You're so wonderful
I thank my lucky stars above
Take my all 'cause I have so much
When you are here with me, love
Do you paint a picture of me?
We have a love
Yes, you're gonna love this, my man.
Yes. Toot, toot, toot.
You'll never score with this one, boss.
We have a love
Sic'em, tiger.
Take my all 'cause I have so much
When you are here with me, love
Hey, it's really crowded here.
Let's go home.
Oh, come on, Dave.
Give it a chance.
Try to open up.
Excuse me, are these seats taken?
No, no. Please.
Could you move over one just, uh...
No.
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Right.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
How about a drink?
I don't like that dress.
You've liked it every other time
I've worn it.
Your breasts...
Every other time you wore it... your breasts weren't making their debut.
This is the way the designer intended... the dress to be worn.
I'd like a drink.
It's a little warm in here.
How can you be warm?
You're not wearing anything.
Did the...
Did the designer also intend for every other guy here... to look at your tits?
Dave, they're my tits, not yours.
You're my wife!
That makes them our tits.
- Hello.
- Hi.
And our tits should be home where they belong... not out on the town.
And I do mean "out".
It's wonderful
ID's?
Are you kidding?
Is he kidding, dear?
He must be, dear.
We haven't been carded in years.
Let's see 'em.
What kind of ID's are these.
The regular kind.
They're Idaho driver's licenses.
You ladies are a long way from home.
Well, there ain't much dancin' in Idaho.
According to these, you're 34 and you're 37.
Isn't that amazing?
Something about that Idaho water, you know.
Take a hike.
Oh, fabulous.
Oh, I knew this wasn't gonna... oh, I knew this wasn't gonna work. Oh, God.
Game room.
And if anyone's going to the bar... would you get me a banana daiquiri?
Here, put this on.
What is this?
Lip gloss.
It makes you look hot.
- You're sick.
- Try it.
No, thanks, Carl.
Suit yourself.
See anything decent?
Would I love to jump on her bones.
There's a big guy with her... who looks like he'd like to jump on your head.
Bad news.
Not really.
She's, uh, far from a winner.
You know somethin'?
You're starting to depress me, you know that?
You are beginning to depress me.
Why don't you play pinball... and I'll go up to the loun and check things out, ok?
- Good idea.
- All right.
I'll meet you in 10 minutes at the bar.
- All right?
- At the bar?
Uh-Huh.
In 10 minutes?
Uh-Huh.
- Good. Right.
- Ok. Mmm hmm.
All right, see that guy?
He is a creep.
How do I know?
How do you know?
Heavy polyester.
I mean, polyester on a dance floor?
That is a creep, jennifer.
What about... what about, like, double knits?
- You know?
- Oh, yeah.
Like a really light, kind of summery seersucker.
Well, um... ok, if it's tasteful.
Ok, tasteful seersucker, and polyester out.
Oh, oh, zodiac signs.
Oh, zodiac signs, nil.
Zodiac signs have always been just nil. Ok.
All right, now, the absolute proof of creephood: does he come in a friend's car?
Oh, come on.
Maddy, Maddy, you came in my car.
That's different.
Excuse me.
This is ridiculous.
I hope you're not thirsty.
You could die before you get a drink here.
Here you are, Mr. Demarco.
How's it going?
Great, Billy. Thanks.
Hey, bartender, what is this what am I, a leper?
Hey, come on. Hey, Billy.
Hey, can I have a beer, please?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You bet your sweet ass you're sorry.
Do you walk around town?
Shirley?
Are you Shirley?
I'm supposed to meet her her for a blind date.
One of those computer deals.
You've got to be kidding.
No. You're dressed in blue.
That's what she's supposed to be wearing.
This is not blue.
It's turquoise.
Hey, I don't give a shit.
You wanna dance?
Are you, uh, standin' in a hole?
Excuse me.
Goddamn broads is gone too far.
Jennifer, Jennifer, just don't turn around, don't look anxious... but there are 2 hunks behind your left shoulder.
Just whatever you do, just pretend you don't notice.
Oh, God. Ok, well, I don't know.
What do we say after "hello".
Jennifer, be like me, casual.
I can't.
It's hard to be casual.
It's not easy to be casual...
I'm sorry.
This is not casual.
I going to fix this for you, and it going to be...
Here's your drink.
See I sorted it. I'm fine.
Ignore this.
Here, have a nut.
I'm sorry.
Oh, there's a rag. Thank you.
Here, let me just get that.
That's good. I dropped my...
I'm going to get my purse.
Can we leave?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're always sorry.
I'm not sorry. I'm not sorry.
She's sorry.
We are not giving up.
I think the big mistake... was bringing the money in that jar.
Well, how else was I supposed to carry the change?
Why didn't your mother just give you bills?
Come on, my mom would never give me money to come here.
Would yours?
Then where did you get it?
From my brother.
Your brother?
That cheapskate?
When did he get so generous?
Well I borrowed it.
Oh, fabulous.
Jeannie, if he finds out... he'll beat the crap out of both of us.
Don't be such a worrywart.
We'll have it back before he misses it, ok?
We'll replace whatever we use with what you win.
We have to get in before we can win.
Yeah.
Don't be such a drag.
Come on.
Maybe there's a back door.
There's no back door.
There's got to be a back door.
There's got to be something.
How did people get in?
I wanna go home.
Can we just go home and watch television?
No, I don't want to watch television.
We wanted to come here, so we are here.
My purse! My purse!
No, no, wait, wait!
No, wait, wait!
Goodbye.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
$5! $2.50 a pop!
$2.50 a pop.
$5 here, $10 there.
This is gettin' to be a very expensive evening.
Come on, Dave.
We don't go out that often.
You know... whoever owns this place owns a gold mine.
I mean, if every person here...
Had a drink-and-a-half at $2.50 a pop...
Stop it.
What are you doing?
Come on, Dave.
We didn't come here to do their books.
Let's dance.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Not this one.
I'll dance, but not this dance.
A slow dance.
And then we go home, ok?
No.
What's going to make you happy?
Do you want to go out on the floor... and jump up and down like a lunatic?
I just want to have a good time.
Hello, I'm Tony Demarco.
Uh, is everything ok?
You folks comfortable?
Yes, thank you.
I noticed you when you first came in.
I haven't seen you here before, have I?
Do you notice everyone?
Is that your job?
No, I own the place, so I pretty well know everybody who's a regular here.
And I especially would have remembered... someone as pretty as you.
Thank you.
I have a little hunch about something.
Are you a stewardess for T.W.A.?
No, she's a wife with the P.T.A.
You know, uh, supermarkets, church, McDonald's.
You know the type.
You're a very lucky guy.
Evelyn. Evelyn... bring these folks a drink on me.
No, really, it's not necessary.
No, no, no, let him.
It's my pleasure.
Would you like to dance with me?
Is it all right, honey?
Sure, ok.
It'll never happen, buddy.
I see you're busy fighting the girls off.
Hey, what took you so long, huh?
What?
There were a couple of winners hangin' around here before.
If you had been here, we could've scored.
How would you know?
You can't see 2 feet in front of your face.
I don't need to see them.
These 2 were winners.
I'm tellin' you, winners.
You know somethin'?
You know what this place reminds me of?
- Disneyland with tits.
- Yeah.
- Drink?
- Later.
I'll have a... hey, what is this, huh?
I see something.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
You know, life really sucks.
I mean, this place is the pits.
I think everyone in America... is in here looking for cheap thrills.
I can't stand it.
I mean, it is bad news.
It's like a zoo in here.
It's so tacky.
I'm gonna get out of here.
What are you doin' in here?
Oh, it's lousy in here.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
You bet your sweet ass you're sorry.
Shirley!
Shirley!
Shirley!
Shirley!
Gus! Gus!
Shirley?
Gus, is that you?
Over here, Shirley!
Over here.
Can you see my card?
To your left!
To your left!
No, no, no, your other left!
This way. Over here!
I can't see you.
Shirley, I can see you.
Just follow me. Over here.
Come on, a little closer.
Come on.
Gus!
Get around the big guy.
Come on, Shirley. Come on.
Hey, Shirley?
Gus?
Shirley?
Gus Micola.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Gus? Gus.
Have a nice time.
It'll be $5, please.
- Thank you.
- You know what time it is?
No I don't have a watch.
Sorry. Right hand, please.
Enjoy yourself.
The moonlight, the music and you
Love and I'm yearning for you
Won't you give me a sign?
After dark, will you be mine?
After dark, the light will shine
Love is such a wonderful bind
We can tie our hearts and be one of a kind
After dark, your love will be mine
Damn it, speed, what are you doin' to me, man?
I can't wait any longer for The Commodores.
I'm taking this show back here to the station.
Man, what are you talkin' about?
The Commodores are here, man.
They've been here for a while.
Hey, fellows, say hello to Sam and calm him down.
What's happenin', Sam, baby?
We're here, Sam, and we're ready to wail!
You better thank your lucky stars.
You got somebody of value like Bobby Speed.
You know, Sam, huh?
Out of sight, speed!
We go on live as planned.
Have them set up and ready to start at 12:00, sharp.
- Oh, we got you, baby.
- Yeah, we can dig it.
- No sweat, Sam.
- Yeah, all right, fellows.
Thanks, man.
Yeah, all right.
Oh, we'll see you in a few minutes.
Yeah, ok.
Hey, Sam, what you worried about?
I told you everything was cool.
I think somebody made a mistake.
You bet your sweet ass somebody made a mistake.
You're taller than me.
You know I filled out my form so carefully.
I asked to be matched with somebody in government.
That's what you got.
I work for the city.
I'm a garbage collector.
Garbage?
Hey, I never touch the shit.
I just drive the truck.
Why? What do you do?
Oh, I teach the sixth grade at the Huntley Grammar School.
Christ, I told'em no college broads!
You think you know everything.
You know, I'm going to get those computer bastards for this.
Hey!
You want to speed it up in there, huh?
We could probably just make the best of it.
There ain't no best to this.
This is the worst!
Hey!
Will you shake your ass, huh?
Gus, calm down.
Calm down, nothin'.
Your time is up.
I got to go.
You know,
I work too hard for my money.
I put too much time into this... and they ain't gonna get away with this... those, uh.
I got no change.
Give me a dime.
Well, I'll see if I have one.
I don't know.
Come on, give me a dime, will you?
I've only got one dime... and I'm gonna need it to call my therapist.
Don't, don't let it keep going on
You know, I'd rather be
Hurt and cryin'
Than sayin' goodbye
If she can experience,
I can experience.
Whatever we feel
Let's make a deal, to be for real
Do you always stand like that?
Only when I feel my energy being drained.
Standing on one leg... doesn't allow the energy complete flow.
You can lose it in the floor.
Would you like to dance?
- Well, uh...
- Yes, you would.
Yeah, ok.
Whatever's on your mind, let it be revealed
Oh, that's love for him
Let's make a deal to be completely
Together, together
Let's make a deal to be completely
Together, together
Let's make a deal
Wanna be real with each other
Hey, little ladies, what's happenin'?
What are you doin' out here?
They won't let us in.
In so you get us... or we're going to have a little talk... with the owner of that car.
Hey.
Ow, she's a brick house
She's mighty mighty, just lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick house
The lady's stacked, and that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back
She's a brick house
Well we're together everybody knows
This is how the story goes
She knows she's got everything
That a woman needs, to get a man
How can she lose, with such a youth
Ooh, what a winnin' hand
She's a brick house
She's mighty mighty, just lettin' it all hang out
She's a brick house
Peace.
That lady's stacked, and that's a fact
Hey, where y'all been, man?
En route, baby.
En route.
You know, you had me shaking, you know.
But I never lost faith. Never lost faith.
I knew you wouldn't let me down.
You see, this is going to be the dance contest, right?
Yeah!
It's going to make my career, you know what I mean?
Tonight is going to be the hottest night ever.
All right!
Bobby, baby... we're more than glad to do the favor for you.
Yeah, yeah.
But we got one problem.
Oh, no problems, no problems, fellows.
No equipment, baby.
Hey, man, that's all fine.
I'll fix it.. I...
What? No instruments?
You're jiving, man.
- Oh, come on, you're kiddin'.
- No, not kidding.
You're just joking, right?
You guys do this in your act.
But we got it all solved.
We got our man, Floyd,
Bringin' it down from San Francisco.
Floyd? "Wrong way" Floyd?
No, man! You didn't give your instruments to Floyd, man!
Why? Why you do that, man?
Where am I?
5. Route 5.
Where the hell is route 5?
I'm gettin' sleepy.
Man, you didn't really give them to Floyd, did you, man?
You're jivin' me, right? Huh?
Everything's going to be cool.
For sure.
Your instruments are downstairs, right? Down?
Don't worry about it, man.
Floyd's on his way.
Yeah.
Hey, Lionel, thanks, man, yeah.
No instruments?
Jesus Christ, Floyd.
Who are you?
You mean, you don't know who I am?
No.
Why, I'm Nicole Sims.
The hottest thing in all of the New York discos.
I'm surprised.
That a big DJ like you, wouldn't know that.
You mean, you're not with The Commodores?
Oh, The Comms?
- I'm sorry.
- Be careful now.
Hey, I know that.
I'd love to love you, baby.
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.
Hey, hey, hey, look, wait a minute.
Now you've gone too far.
I don't know how you got in here, but you've got to go. Out.
- Listen, you ain't seen...
- All right?
You ain't seen the last of me yet.
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Nicole Sims. S I M S.
Right. Thank you, bye.
Yes. O U T, "out". Bye.
May I?
You can always tell a lady
By the company she keeps
You can always tell a lady
From the company she keeps
Excuse me, lady.
Could you shave over here?
By the company she keeps.
You can always tell a lady
From the company she keeps
Can you hold this, please?
Good luck.
I've been messing up and mad since 20
And your friends leave a lot to ask for
When you have to pay and you can't introduce them
Ah, can I buy you a drink?
Can I buy you a drink, baby?
Thank you.
It smells like my brother's room.
Excuse me, girls.
You can always tell a lady
By the company she keeps
You can always tell a lady
From the company she keeps
Hey, hold it.
Where are you two going?
You can get locked in there.
The doors don't open from the other side.
Security.
Oh, thanks.
We'd hate to have to get locked in there.
Yeah, our husbands would miss us.
Find my way
I must leave you, try to find my way
I can't take it, not another day
Please don't stop me, let me go and find my way
You got me
Hey, you want to dance?
All right.
I'll catch you later, Jen.
Maddy.
Hi, sweetheart.
What do you say?
Nothing.
Hey, uh... what a beautiful smile!
Are you alone?
Don't I know you? I know you.
I know you from somewhere.
No, you don't know me.
I've never been here.
That's all right.
You want to dance?
- You're on my purse.
- Huh? Oh, sorry.
I don't want to dance.
What are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid of anything.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I don't want to dance.
You want to sit?
You want to just sit and talk?
I'll sit and talk.
I don't want to talk.
You want to go for a walk?
I'll go for a walk.
We'll walk.
We'll go walk someplace.
I don't want to walk.
I don't want to talk.
I don't want to dance.
All right, wait-wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Didn't you come here lookin' for some action?
Yeah.
I'm still looking.
Got to leave you, got to find my way
Bobby Speed.
Bobby Speed.
- Hello.
- Hello, this is Sue.
How do you do?
This is my star, Bobby Speed.
What are you doing?
You've got to loosen up a little.
Let that laugh out.
That's more like it.
You're definitely not a Dave.
Do you mind if I call you Babakazoo?
What's a "Babakazoo"?
Just a name.
Use it like an umbrella.
Now the jacket comes off.
Jackets suppress the main energy.
That's why snakes keep shedding their skins.
That's amazing.
Who told you that?
No one.
Do you wear it all the time?
Well, it's expected in the office.
You see, I'm an accountant...
A.C.P.A. with Brody,
Forman and Steinberg.
You ever hear of them?
No, but I know a guy who works at William Morris.
Listen, what are you doin'?
You'll be free.
You're wrapped too tight.
You have to emerge, like a butterfly.
From a caterpillar!
Listen, I have to tell you something.
Hello, hello, I'm married.
No, David is married.
Babakazoo belongs to everyone.
Oh, my God. I think I'm going to get a headache.
Oh. You are?
Look what I have.
These will perk you up.
A rainbow.
Here, eat these.
Well, just 2, thank you.
Here.
Oh.
The money's in my pocket now.
I'm gonna take it home.
You're not scorin' with this one, buddy.
I hope they don't upset my stomach.
Aspirin does that sometimes.
Oh, they won't.
Don't worry, they're not aspirin.
Me, Jane. You, Tarzan!
You are the reason I feel like dancing.
Hey, sweetheart.
Haven't I seen you here before?
You got a beautiful smile.
What say we go back to my place... and, uh, see God?
I met him.
He's got a great smile.
Hi.
Are you talking to me?
You come here a lot?
Yeah, sometimes.
I'm Kathy.
I'm, uh, Carl.
Nice to meet you.
Would you like a drink?
Let me buy you a drink.
Uh, vodka on the rocks and a...
- Beer.
- Beer.
It's gettin' awfully warm in here.
Yeah.
Wouldn't you like to leave?
What?
I've got this lovely apartment... and it's not crowded.
Wait a minute, let me get this straight... are you asking me... if I want to go home with you?
Yeah, I've had enough here.
Haven't you?
Yeah.
I took my sweater off... and I left it in the game room.
- I'll go get it and I'll meet...
- No.
You wait here.
I'll go get it.
The game room, right.
And it's a shaggy green sweater.
Shaggy green sweater.
You stay here, I'll be right back.
You're a heavenly little lady
And I'm saying that because I do
You are the reason I speak
Ooh, baby I am ready.
I am ready.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
No.
Oh, no.
Hey!
Open the door! Help me!
Open the door.
I'm trapped in a stairway
Can't get out, got to shout
Got a date, can't be late
Excuse me, you mind if I cut in?
Oh. Do you mind if he cuts in?
No, fine with me.
Thank you.
All right.
What do I know?
Can't get out, got to shout
Got a date
Can't be late
Ok, ok, don't lose it.
Everything's gonna be all wrong.
I mean, all right.
Everything's going to be fine.
Stay calm, stay calm.
All right, this is Bobby Speed.
Comin' to you from the Zoo over K.D.C.O.
With a special dedication... to a long lost friend of mine.
And, Floyd, you better be tuned in... or the next song I dedicate is going to be taps.
Uh, what's the problem, captain?
You look like a man in a hurry to get somewhere.
Was I speeding?
You got a bill of sale for this stuff?
Say, brother, you got the wrong idea.
I'm working for The Commodores...
Yeah, brother.
And I'm Baretta.
Hey, hey
Hey I was wondering what happened to you.
Yeah? Yeah, we're still here.
I'm glad, because you are a woman.
I'm a woman?
Yes I am.
And I am a man.
Yes, you definitely are a man.
You like me?
You're very nice.
I'm here every night.
Dancin' and dancin' and dancin.
She likes to dance a lot, too.
I dance every day, all day long.
I never stop.
Nothing else matters.
Everything else is bullshit.
I dance in my job.
They tell me to stop. Do I stop?
No.
Do they fire me?
Yes.
Do I care?
No. And why?
Because I am a dancer.
Only when I am dancin', do I know I'm alive.
Only when I'm dancin', do I feel free.
Only when I'm dancin', do I know who I am.
Who are you?
I'm Marv Gomez, The Leatherman.
Oh, he is the one.
He is the one.
He's got someone.
Yeah, ok.
This really is beautiful.
Yeah, I thought this would be a place... to get a little peace and quiet.
You really do enjoy all of this, don't you?
Well, why not?
It's a long way... from hustling records to the AM radio stations.
Is that what you did?
In another life.
Yeah. Until the disco thing.
I said, "Tony, there's gonna be... a wave of nightlife in this country... and you're gonna ride the crest".
I hocked everything I had, opened up this place.
Now I'm wealthy, I'm happy.
And I'm particularly happy to get... the opportunity to meet a woman like you.
Ah, you sell jewelry, too?
Yes I do.
Let's look.
Ok.
Pick something up.
Oh, I couldn't.
Let me see those rings.
She's already got a ring.
A wedding ring.
Better yet, let me see them gold chains.
You mean one like this?
Yeah, one just like that.
That's right.
I'd like to take you home now so we can be alone together.
I know it would be very, very good.
I don't think...
Dave would like that.
Yes, but how would you like it?
I really think I'd better be going now.
He'll be wondering where I am.
Jeez, what happened?
Here.
These will wake you up.
Eat these.
It better be good... or your ass is in the slammer.
Come on, man, let's go.
Saving the best for last. Hold it.
Yeah, all right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Since you came
I feel like lovin' again
I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again
Ooh, since you came
I feel like lovin' again
And I feel like livin' again
And I feel like givin' again
Excuse me, I was wondering if...
So was I. Is this me?
I don't know.
Just one more time we do it.
Thank you very much.
You ok?
You want a hit?
Yeah, sure.
Come on.
I like to smoke to get in touch with my man, you know.
I got to get things straight with him before the dance contest...
'cause if he ain't on your side, you may as well be dancin' on banana peels.
I'm gonna win tonight.
Yeah? Good luck to you.
Hey, where you going?
Ah, home.
Hey, the night's just beginnin'.
For you, maybe, but...
Oh, nothing happening, huh?
Hey.
That used to be my problem... before I started wearing leather.
No kidding.
I was lower than whale shit.
Zip.
And then it happened.
I bought my first leather coat.
Oh, it was smooth, real rugged.
Like me, Marv Gomez,
The Leatherman.
Hey.
I'm going to change your life.
Hey.
Oh, no, no, no.
Aw, come on, put this on.
It was my first one.
Say, leather's what you've been waiting for.
It's not bad. This is...
This is kind of nice.
It's beautiful!
Now all you got to do is dance.
Dance?
That's a joke, man.
Look, I'm not a dancer, you see.
I've got worse than 2 left feet.
I got no left feet.
You see I don't dance.
Hey, man, let me tell you somethin'.
You ain't gonna be happy until you're free.
And the only way you're going to be free... is to get loose.
And the only way you're going to get loose is to dance.
Now, come on... let me see some of your moves.
Moves.
Ok, moves.
Hey, man, you know, you're in serious trouble.
Yeah?
Yeah. Here, try this.
No, man. No, no, don't you hear the music?
Here, watch.
You go step, tap, step, tap.
- Step, tap.
- Step, tap.
Then you reverse it.
Reverse that.
6 beats, 7 steps.
Then you step on your left... kick out with your right, and kick, turn... yee, and face your partner.
I can't do that.
Hey, man, let me tell you somethin'.
Little kids are doin' it.
Old ladies are doin' it.
Everybody's doin' it.
Now, come on, dance.
Dance, dance...
Come on, baby.
There you got it. Come on.
You got it, baby.
You got it, baby. You got it.
Dance. Dance. Let's go.
Come on, baby you got it, baby.
Come on, come on, you got it.
Yeah.
Hey.
Dancing! Everything else is bullshit!
Hey.
Hey.
The last time you touched me
You filled my heart with song
Where you going?
I'm Diane, the new waitress.
Bobby's hungry.
Knock, knock.
Yeah, it's open.
Yeah?
Memorial hospitaI, emergency room?
Y'all by any chance... got a Nigger in there named Floyd?
I brought you a snack.
Just put it over there, baby.
No, not Fong.
Floyd. Malcolm Floyd.
Find out what you can do about...
You again?
Hey, look, baby, don't you understand.
The first rule of any disco is don't bug the DJ.
I just wanted to help.
I just wanted to tell you you're doin' a good job tonight.
You're steppin' all over my records.
Baby I don't need any more hassles.
Lookit, you got your chance, give me mine.
Let me sing.
Are you...
Just listen to my demo.
What is this?
Don't you remember when you first started?
Well, everybody got to start somewhere.
Why not here?
You are nuts.
Lady, don't you understand?
This is going out live.
There are millions of people listenin' to my golden tones.
I ain't gonna blow it.
This ain't amateur night.
Listen, Mr. Bigshot DJ,
I ain't no amateur!
I paid my dues.
All I'm askin' for is a chance.
Lady, please.
Hey, bear!
All right.
All right.
I'll go.
But my mind's made up.
And when it's made up, it stays made up!
Wait a minute, wait a minute look, what's your name?
Nicole, Nicole, you're beautiful, and I'd really love to talk to you sometime.
But right now,
I got my own problems. Right.
I got some freak lost in the woods and I've gotta find him. All right?
Would you take her away from, pease?
Would you take her out?
Hey, we're going all the way tonight, Charlie.
Nobody's gonna stop us.
So I tell you what, grab your favorite animal and get down,
'cause we're all gonna boogie.
Which reminds me of my old friend, Floyd... who loves to boogie.
But, Floyd, you can't dance if your legs is broke.
Oh, no, no.
God be my strength and my deliverance.
I know, I know you think I stole'em... but I got news for you.
They're not hot, they're not stolen, or nothing.
Come here, let me show you somethin'.
Uh, could you hold these for me? Thank you.
I'll show you what I can do.
I'll show you who I work for.
I'm gonna show you, oh yeah,
I'm gonna show you.
Oh yeah, I'm gonna show you.
Hey, sorry.
You bet your sweet ass you're sorry.
You dip.
To love, to love, to love
To love, to love, to love
Hey.
What are you hangin' around here for?
You think some fairy Godmother.
Is gonna show up at midnight... and turn me into a lawyer?
I'm not hanging around you.
I just haven't left yet.
What's wrong with you, anyway.
Hey, don't make fun of my height.
I'm not talking about your height.
I don't care that you're a shrimp.
I do care that you're an insensitive shrimp.
Well, let me tell you somethin', lady.
I bust my hump all week workin'.
Come Friday night,
I ain't got time to be Mr. Nice Guy.
Well, let me telI you something.
I feel sorry for you.
Because you're an unhappy person.
What the hell I got to be happy about?
I'm out with an old maid.
Oh?
An old maid with a great right hook, you bastard.
We were 2 lonely people... and we should have been nice to each other.
But, no. You work too hard.
You creep!
Anybody else?
Shirley.
If you love, to love, to love
If you love, love, love
Hey, baby, you wanna dance, huh?
Losers!
You're all losers!
A simple "no" would have sufficed.
A chick with a big right hook?
We was made for each other.
Shirley.
Everybody!
Matilda, Matilda...
She takes me money and run Venezuela.
Matilda...
Matilda, she takes me mone and run Venezuela.
Where've you been? Ha?
Remember me?
I've been lookin' for you.
I want to talk to you.
Let's sit down.
Wait I don't want to sit down.
I got too much energy or something.
What's happened to your clothes?
You like it?
Who do I look like?
I'll give you one guess:
Harry Belafonte.
Matilda...
Why are you talking so fast?
I'm not talking fast.
This is how I always talk, only you never noticed it before.
But I bet you noticed how that asshole talked, ha.
And I also noticed... that hippie freak you've adopted.
I want to know... is one evening with her worth 5 years of marriage?
What are you talking about?
5 years of what?
One evening with who?
Dave, I want to sit down.
I don't want to sit.
Who's Dave?
I'm Babakazoo.
Look, I'm afraid of what's happening here.
To both of us.
Let's go home.
Yeah.
I'm drunk. You can take advantage of me.
Advantage? Advantage.
You are the one who wanted me to be more open.
That's what I'm doing:
I'm staying and I'm opening.
Matilda, Matilda...
Matilda, she take my money and run Venezuela.
Dear God.
I have somethin' i want to share with you.
I am trying to take responsibility... for everything that is going on here.
But there's somethin' that I want you to get:
I want you to get me out of here.
Honey, honey.
From now on... it's you and me for the rest of the evening.
To us.
Hey.
Maddy.
Jennifer, I was looking for you.
I just had the most awful experience.
- I want to split.
- Oh, good.
See I met these really hot guys, and they're going to a really hot party.
- A boogie party.
- Wait a minute.
What about the dance contest?
You want to stay for the dance contest?
Uh, no. There's this jacuzzi party,
And they're gonna get really down.
I mean, you'd be kind of uncomfortable there.
It's not your kind of party...
Why not change your mind and come?
No I don't wanna come with you.
All right.
I'll see you at work on monday.
You don't mind stayin' here?
No I don't mind.
You can go.
Oh, thanks. Well, oh, you'll have a great time.
No, you'll have a really great time.
Have a really good time, Maddy.
Bye, Jennifer.
Mad...
You are gonna be a star
I'm sure that was polyester.
All my plans went wrong.
Everything.
I lost all my brother's money...
And our friends will laugh us out of school.
And worst of all, i dragged you into this mess.
You were right.
I just should have kept my mouth shut.
You told me... that I was the greatest dancer at taft high.
You told me...
I could do anything if i set my mind to it.
We came here to do something... and I'm not quitting now.
I'm gonna enter that dance contest... if I have to go out on that floor... and dance all alone.
Maybe you won't have to dance alone.
Miss?
Yes?
Do you know Marv Gomez?
Yes.
Well, uh, he's down in the game room and...
He's doubled over with pain.
He says you should meet him down there right away.
- I think it's his appendix.
- Yeah.
Oh, no. I told him not to dance so much.
Yeah.
This will be faster.
Here.
- Gee, thanks.
- Yeah.

Let's hear everybody!
Nicole Sims. That's S I M S.
Yeah. Whoo!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry. I'm...
I'm sorry.
I mean I could have maimed you for life.
It's ok.
It's ok?
It's ok.
It's ok.
It's ok.
Is that shirt cotton?
Yes.
A 100 percent?
Yes.
What do you mean, you haven't seen her?
She was just up here singing her heart out for me.
Look she couldn't have gone up in smoke. Just look, just keep looking for the best thing... that's walked into this disco in the last 4 months, and it's mine.
Yeah, what is it?
Yeah, Bobby, Floyd's here.
You're kiddin'. All right!
Hey, all right, all right, now we're on a hot roll.
Whatever you've been holdin' back, let it go.
Whatever you've been savin' up, spend it.
'Cause we're hummin'... and the big dance contest is comin'.
No, I couldn't do that. No.
Hey, hey, where are you going?
Where are you going?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I've got to get out of here.
This place is driving me crazy.
You've been very nice and all of that... but this is really all so bad.
No, no, no, wait a minute.
I know exactly what you're going through.
Believe me I do. With your husband in there like that and everything.
I know how that feels.
- Do you?
- Yes I do.
That's why I don't want you to go.
You shouldn't be alone, especially now.
Susan, I'm gonna be very straight with you.
For whatever it's worth, i can't play any games anymore... not the way i feel about you.
- Oh, please, no more...
- No, no, wait a minute.
You know, before when you walked away from me...
I found myself missing you.
I realized I'd lost something very important I'd just now found.
I care for you.
See you later, Tony.
I don't know, something's happening.
I care for you very deeply.
I mean it.
And I can't explain it in any rational way.
This sort of thing doesn't usually happen to me.
I'm just as confused about it as you are.
And I'm not used to being confused, either.
Tony, we'd better talk now.
No, we'd better not.
Can we make this...
I have to talk to you.
- No, no, please.
- It's about last weekend.
Can we make it later, sweetheart, please?
Please. Thank you.
Susan, all my life, all my life...
I've been fighting to keep free from these feelings... but you've done it to me.
Your vitality, your commitment to life... everything about you excites me... in a brand new way that I've never felt before.
You know for me, it feels like the first time.
It's as if, uh, I've been waiting here for you.
What do you want?
Jesus, Tony.
You said, later.
I figured this was later.
No, this isn't later.
This is now.
"Later" means much later, ok?
- Ok.
- Ok.
I don't know.
I can't say it any other way.
I know what you're trying to say.
I know what you're about.
I have eyes and a brain.
And I don't want you to go.
Why?
You seem to have an abundance of friends.
That's right.
That's right.
I could be with any one of them tonight.
You know I wouldn't have to go home alone.
But I would rather be here with you.
With you, Susan.
Than with any other woman in the place.
And that comes from my heart.
Come on.
I wanna go back in, ok?
Ok, the rules are simple: when the red light hits you, you're out!
And now, the best thing that's happened to dancing since feet.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for the fabulous Commodores!
There's Walter, there's William, there's Thomas, there's Lionel, there's Milan, and there's Ronald.
Yeah.
My men, The Commodores!
All right!
Yeah, hey, hey.
Say, what?
You're too hot ta trot
Well you're too hot ta trot now, baby
Well you're too hot ta stop
I was never in a dance contest before.
What do you got to do?
Simple. You just get out on the floor... and shake your ass like it was on fire.
Got you.
Here.
This will help.
Take a whiff.
When the red light hits you, you're out!
What you're doin to me, girl.
I can see you right now
That you're the best thing around.
How could she do this to me?
The Leatherman has got to have a partner.
Hey.
So does Frannie.
Oh, what luck!
Frannie, this is Marv.
Ok.
Well, you're too hot ta trot now, baby
Well you're too hot ta stop

Sweet pretty woman

That I love you
Oh I love, love you, baby
My head is spinning
With what you're doing to me
Girl, I want you, girl I love you
Oh, I love what you're doin' to me, sweet thing
Oh I love you, little sweet thing

Too hot ta trot

Too hot ta stop
All right, we have a winner, ladies and gentlemen.
It wasn't easy, but there he is.
All right! The man in leather and his partner.
First prize winner,
$200, and a trophy... presented to them by The Commodores.
Let's hear it, everybody!
Hey, hey. Congratulations to our winners.
Yeah, whoo!
Thank you very much.
What time is it?
Hey.
It's 12:15.
Fabulous.
We're gonna get killed.
We were supposed to be home at 11:00.
$50, Frannie.
We pay back my brother.
We got enough for the concert!
Who cares about that dumb old concert?
That's for kids.
We're disco queens now.
It's too bad you disco queens... got to be home so early.
If we hurry... we can make it to Big Mamas... for the 1:00 dance contest.
Our parents will kill us.
You're right.
Let's go!
Babakazoo.
Who's Babakazoo? Oh.
You stay here with me.
I'll take care of you.
What are you talking about?
Where's my wife?
Where's Sue?
My wife.
Sue?
My wife.
What we'll do is take a long ride up the coast.
I have some tapes of Frank we'll listen to.
I know this little place in Santa Barbara... right on the water.
It's gonna be real nice.
It sounds nice.
Sue! Sue!
What do you want?
What do I want?
I'll tell you what I want. Dave!
You put a ding in it.
Dave, don't.
I'll put a ding in your dong,
That's what I'll put a ding in!
What do I want?
There, there's your wife.
I didn't even touch her.
You didn't...
You didn't touch her?
Until next time... this is your zookeeper, Bobby Speed, reminding you... keep them feet movin'... or somebody will steal your shoes.
Nicole Sims.

Hiya, Tony. Two or three?
Two. Two. Give me two. That's good.
Hey, you guys do layaway?
As long as it don't turn into a 20-year mortgage.
All right, look, put me down for $5 for that blue shirt in the window.
- Hold it for me.
- Hey, wait for your receipt.
- I trust you.
- Please don't. Don't trust me.
- What did he charge you?
That bastard.
Wait till he runs out of something.
Listen, you know what to tell her.
Excuse me, ma'am, I gotta get by.
- Got a second?
- Just a minute.
Look what I got for you,
Carnival, gold, just like you wanted.
Where have you been?
I've been here for a half hour.
That's all right. Look, I'm gonna make you a deal on this paint.
- I'm very angry with you.
- That's all right.
Look, I'm gonna make you a nice deal on this. $1 off for you.
$10.98 on this special gold paint.
- How you like that?
- Thank you.
- I'll take a gallon of this.
- All right.
You got it. Heads up.
That's all right.
Customers like that, it gives them a sense of power.
I need some brushes.
All right, how much painting you planning to do?
After these two rooms,
I wouldn't paint my wife's ass purple.
What color is it now?
You wanna know what color my wife's ass is?
You brung it up.
Actually, it ain't got no color, just stripes, them stretch stripes.
What about them brushes?
Right. See that second display counter?
Over there.
- Hey, Mr. Fusco, can I get an advance?
- Payday's Monday.
I know payday is Monday, but every place else is Friday or Saturday.
And they're broke on Monday.
- Boozing, whoring...
- Oh, come off it.
Pissing away their money all weekend.
This way, you're paid on a Monday, you got money all week.
- You can save a little, build a future.
- Oh, fuck the future.
No, Tony, you can't fuck the future, the future fucks you.
It catches up with you, and it fucks you if you ain't planned for it.
Look, tonight is the future, and I am planning for it.
There's a shirt I gotta buy, a beautiful shirt. Blue...
Sorry, Tony, no exceptions.
Just wait till you need an advance, all right?
Big shot.
Hey, come on.
Thanks, Tony.
Where you been?
Your mother wants to know where you been.
Where you been?
Your father's asking you!
Where you been?
Dinner's gonna be late tonight, they was out of things at the market.
But you'd have been late if it was normal.
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey, hot stuff. Give me a kiss.
- Look what I made for you. Here.
- Oh, that is beautiful.
- You like it?
- Yeah.
You'll put it in your room?
Yeah, I'll put it in my room right now, how's that?
- Okay.
- All right.
- Dinner's on the table.
- I ain't hungry.
Hey, just because you're kicking in for food, don't mean you don't gotta eat.
You still gotta eat.
- I got my shirt on, all right?
- So?
So, I don't want to get anything on it, that's what.
You got nothing to be afraid of.
Your mother's spaghetti sauce don't drip.
It don't taste and it don't drip.
Let's go.
How come every day it's the same thing?
I come home, you tell me I'm late for dinner when you know that I gotta work till 6:00 and I can't make dinner on time.
You should've been a priest, like your brother, you wouldn't worry about a job.
Yeah.
Every time you mention Frank, Jr., you gotta cross yourself?
He's a priest, ain't he?
Father Frank, Jr., your brother.
Your mother doesn't have much to cross herself about these days.
You're so jealous of Frank, Jr.
- Oh, shut up, will you?
- Hey!
- What are you doing?
- Hey, the shirt! Watch the shirt, stupid.
- Basta!
- All right. Come on.
- Mangia, mangia.
- Yeah, go ahead. Eat, eat.
I got more pork chops, more spaghetti.
What do you mean, you got more pork chops? I'm out of work.
Yeah, well, as long as we got $1 left, we eat good in this house.
- What?
- Yeah, I might even get a job myself.
Like hell, you will.
Twenty-five years in construction work,
I always brought home a paycheck.
What, six, seven months
I'm out of work?
Then, all of a sudden, what?
- You're hitting me and talking back.
- All right, all right.
Talking about getting a job and hitting me.
All right, all right. No hitting, no slapping at the dinner table. Okay?
That's the rule.
And you was the one that was hitting.
You never hit me before. Never.
Not in front of the kids.
- One pork chop! One!
- Hey, Frank!
It's disgusting, Ma. He's sick.
Will you just watch the hair?
You know, I work on my hair a long time and you hit it.
He hits my hair.
Take care of his hair.
I'm gonna take a walk.
Tony, you walk me to church later?
Didn't you go already today?
Yeah, confession.
I gotta go back and pray for something.
For what?
I gotta pray for Father Frank, Jr. To call me.
Why don't you call him direct?
I want him to call me.
A son should call his mother.
Wait a minute. You're going to church to have God make Frank, Jr. Call you?
- Right.
- I don't believe it.
You know, you're turning God into a telephone operator.
Go, go, now!
Hey, you scumbags! Get back here!
- Assholes.
- Come on, fuckhead!
Hey, the stubborn fuck won't budge.
- Will you put two hands on the wheel?
- I got two hands on the wheel!
Hey, you know, you assholes almost broke my pussy finger.
Oh, yeah, you wouldn't know which one it was.
Hey, get some of this, will you?
Hey, Gus, tell them what we got.
Oh, yeah, we got some ups, we got some downs, three ludes, two Js, and a half a bottle of vodka.
All right, yeah, yeah!
That's what you got, huh?
I bet I'd get a bigger high from a fart.
- You want something?
- No.
We ain't dropping nothing till I say so.
- Oh, come on. Why the fuck not?
- Hey, bullshit.
I got my reasons, all right?
I got my reasons.
Oh, fuck, Tony.
What's wrong with you, man?
Hey, give me the vodka.
Hey, when're you gonna get new tapes?
These things are four years old.
I bought them in the bargain basement.
You don't like my tapes?
I'll get new tapes.
Hey, looking sharp, huh?
Sharp as you can look without turning into a nigger.
- Or a spic.
- Spic, spic.
Would you put your dick in a spic?
- Does it get bigger in a nigger?
- I don't know.
I gotta score tonight, man.
I'm horny, you know what I mean?
Horny.
Yeah, man, I know what you mean.
Horny, right? Horny!
Hey, anybody scores, you get in the car for 10 minutes, and you're out for the next guy, all right?
If you get five, you get a medal of honor with rubies, and a piece of the Pope's ass.
What are you talking about, man?
The Pope don't got no ass, that's why he's the Pope.
Now, shape up, you assholes.
We're the faces.
Tony, how's it going? All right?
Hey, Moe!
Hey, Tony, you seen Pauline around here at all?
No, we ain't seen Pauline.
Joey, you seen Pauline?
Hi. What would you like?
- Oh, give me a Seven and Seven.
- Yeah, I'll take a beer.
Hey, I'd like a vodka and tonic.
You guys wanna go see the Knicks on Tuesday? Anybody?
- Give me a...
- Wanna see the Knicks?
Tony.
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, "yeah"?
Well, I mean, I could dance with you, but, you know, you're not my dream girl or nothing like that.
You want a dream girl?
Well, then go to sleep and have a nightmare.
Hey, Gus, here's the speed.
What are you doing? Here, take this.
Hello, again. This is beautiful Monti, your delicious deejay, reminding you about the Universal Disco sweepstakes, so get in line to get the prize.
- Oh, looks good!
- Go, baby.
A trip. A good trip.
Feel the music, baby.
Look at that chick.
I'm gonna dance with her.
Which one?
Come on, Tony! Dance!
All right!
It's so beautiful in there.
I like your new haircuts.
I like that polyester look.
Turn yourself there, baby.
All right!
Yeah!
Hey, Tony, you know something?
You're the king out there.
You're great. You're a great dancer.
You could do as good as me if you practiced.
Yeah?
Think I'd be a good dancer, Tony?
Sure. Why not? No.
- No?
- No.
- Ain't you gonna ask me to sit down?
- No, you'd do it.
- But you'd ask me to lay down.
- No, you would not do it.
Double J, move over.
I want you to meet my friend here.
Hey.
Hey, Tony, listen, you want some speed?
It's very good stuff, Ton.
Really, it's good stuff. You want some?
Can't you guys get off on dancing?
Tony, can I wipe off your forehead?
Why not? Sure. Go ahead.
Hey, Doreen, it ain't no blowjob.
You don't know fuck about women, Joey.
You get a blowjob easier than you get that.
I noticed.
I love to watch you dance, Tony.
- Oh, yeah?
- I love it. I love to watch you dance.
I just love it, watching you dance.
Hey, Tony, listen, do her a favor.
Why don't you take her for a dance, huh?
That's a good idea. Wanna dance?
Would you like to dance with me?
I'd dance with you.
It's for charity.
Any kind of dresses with the lace on the side.
Weirdest chick I ever seen.
Ton, I love to watch you dance.
I just love it, watching you dance.
Doreen, move up a little bit.
Come on, doll.
She's doing a two-step with him.
Jesus Christ.
Get your head out of his belt, there, doll.
Oh, Jesus.
You can't dance to this shit.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- I paid $5 to hear this shit?
You paid $5?
I fucking paid for you to get in.
Hey, Monti, what are you playing that shit for?
What are you talking about, baby?
Look at that chick, she's dancing, man.
She's grooving.
- Joey?
- Yeah.
You know that girl?
No.
- You ever see her before?
- No.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I seen her here about a month ago.
She can dance, you know that?
She got the wrong partner, of course, but she can dance.
- Go ask her.
- Fuck you.
Yeah? Which position?
Who the hell's that guy?
- Hey, Penny.
- Hey, Tony!
- How you doing?
- Okay. How you been?
All right. You gonna dance for me?
- Sure, why not?
- Okay.
- Hello, Lucille.
- Hello, Nureyev. How you doing?
- You got a Seven and Seven for me?
- Sure, doll.
Give me one of your butts, too, all right?
Sure.
Having another sweepstakes.
I know that.
It's double the prize money. $500.
You gonna enter?
Well, you'll need a partner.
We won before.
But we're gonna have to practice.
We'll have to practice.
They got people coming in from Manhattan.
Revelation, Gazebo's.
You know that, right?
We'll have to practice.
That's "practice," Annette.
It don't mean dating, it don't mean socializing, it means practice.
Why not? We had a date.
Yeah, once, and once was enough.
Why?
Why? Annette, the whole time, you talked about your married sister.
And then, you was talking about your other married sister.
And then, your third married sister.
I got the idea that all you was interested in was being a married sister yourself.
I got bored with it.
Hey, look, I told you
I'd take care of it, huh?
Hey, Tony, look, Double J's been in the car 25 minutes with some chick.
So what?
So, I can't get the selfish prick out.
These guys can't do nothing without me, you know that?
Hey, listen, are you gonna make it with Annette?
No, I don't think so.
You know, Joey, you make it with some of these chicks, and they think you gotta dance with them.
Look at this guy, huh?
All right, get out.
You've been in there 20 minutes.
- Come on!
- 25 in the car, 20 in the chick.
Yeah, well, get out before we pull you out.
- She ain't come yet.
- Since when do you care?
Hey, come on!
Whoa. Okay.
- Harder! Harder!
- Okay, it's happening!
It's happening! It's happening!
I'll be out in a minute, man.
Harder! I'm coming! I'm coming!
Oh, yeah!
Yes.
What did you say your name was?
Kiss me.
Kiss me!
Oh, I just kissed Al Pacino!
Al Pacino. I don't look like Al Pacino.
Well, I could look like him.
Al Pacino.
Yeah. Al Pacino.
Al Pacino!
"Attica! Attica!
"Attica! Attica!
- "Attica!"
- Hey, give me the ball.
Hey, you wanna go see that Bruce Lee picture at the Orpheum?
- Yeah!
- Hey, you wanna know something?
Bruce Lee's dead, so I don't give a damn about him.
- Hey, look.
- Man, you got no respect for the dead.
What kind of shit is that, huh?
Hey, you guys see what the Knicks are gonna pay Frazier?
We're never gonna make that much money in our whole life.
- Hey, douche! Douche!
- It's all right. It's okay.
Hey, you know why you don't kill fags on Sunday?
You kill fags on Sunday, they go straight to heaven.
Hey, sweetheart! Hey, your turn, isn't it?
You look so heavenly, it makes me want to die, you know?
Hey, Double J, hey!
You know, this is a drag.
What's with you today, huh?
Nothing.
I'd just rather be doing 2001 tonight.
Yeah? Well, fucking do it.
Oh, "fucking do it."
20, 30 bucks, asshole!
You got 20, 30 bucks to blow twice a week?
- Come on, Tony.
- Hey, Tony.
Man, I'm gonna get myself one of these, you know.
You're never gonna get yourself one of these.
These things cost too much money.
You'll never have that kind of money.
Hey, you, you know,
I've had you up to here.
That's your favorite speech.
You're never gonna have that kind of money.
Not you, not me, not anybody.
Hey, get it together before it's all over the street, huh? You see this?
This is a Caddy Seville.
My Uncle Nunzio's got one of these and he's got a Mercedes Benz, too.
You know how he got it?
He forced his partner to sell out.
He gave him a real screwing.
It's a dog-eat-dog world, right?
Everybody's out for what they can get.
It's true.
They got it all locked up.
Ain't nobody gonna give you a chance.
Nobody gives you nothing, Joey.
Yeah, you know, it's every man for himself.
It's a stinking rat race.
Hey, that stuff goes on beautiful, Tony.
Best vinyl I ever seen at that price.
See? I told you.
You just listen to me, right?
You know, you saved me a bit of change on the job. You know paint.
You ever want a job as a painter, why don't you let me know, huh?
You make twice as much as you make here, but you break your back.
You interested?
- I don't know.
- Don't be interested.
You'll make twice as much, but you'll break your back.
- No advances, no nothing. It's payday...
- I gave you a raise.
- You gave me what?
- A raise.
- You kidding me?
- No. Come on, look. See how much it is.
You gave me a raise? Thank you.
I can't believe this.
Wait, hold on, you better look first.
I don't gotta look.
It don't make no difference.
You gave me a raise.
That's the important thing.
- It's only $2.50.
- So what?
That's $2.50. It ain't much.
The important thing is it's a raise.
I think that's really great.
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna give you $3.50, all right?
- You do not have to, Mr. Fusco.
- I'll give you $3.50.
- I like the raise just the way it is.
- I'll give you $1 more.
Shut up, will you? $4.
I'll make it an even $4.
Christ, I've never seen anybody so shit-ass happy over a crummy $2.50 raise.
Wait a minute. $2?
You just said $4.00, didn't you?
What the hell are you doing?
- I just feel like it, all right?
- Girls do that.
I got a raise today.
How do you like that?
Yeah?
Why didn't you say so during dinner?
We could've used the conversation.
Put them down. Come here.
- How much you get?
- It's gonna be $4.00.
It was... It was $2.50, right?
But he raised the raise when he found out
I wasn't so, you know, disappointed.
- Yeah.
Shit. You know what $4.00 buys today?
It don't even buy $3.00.
I don't see nobody giving you a raise down at Unemployment.
$4.00. Shit.
I knew you'd piss on it.
Go on, just piss on it, right?
A raise says, like, you're good, you know what I mean?
You know how many times somebody told me I was good in my life?
Two. Two. Twice. Two fucking times, this raise today and dancing, dancing at the disco.
You sure as fuck never did. Asshole.
$4.00. Shit.
Why ain't you waiting inside?
Well, I wanted to watch you come down the street.
I like the way you walk.
Shit.
Tony, listen, I've been thinking.
Maybe I'll make it with you.
That's what you call thinking, huh?
Jesus Christ.
You know what? You're too much,
Annette. You know that?
I mean, you say we're gonna make it, that means we're gonna make it, right?
I mean, like,
I got no say in this at all, right?
It's time we went out.
You told me you wanted to do it.
You told me how horny a man gets when he's 19, how much his balls ache morning, noon and night, six days a week, sometimes seven, if he don't get it.
How do you remember those things?
Look, Annette, we're gonna be spending a lot of time together, you know, rehearsing, practicing, whatnot.
If we was balling, it would be like we was going together.
And I won't be going with you.
Look, I mean, what are you, anyway?
You a nice girl or you a cunt?
I don't know. Both?
You can't be both. I mean, that's a thing a girl's gotta decide early on.
You gotta decide whether you're gonna be a nice girl or a cunt.
- How you doing, Pete?
- Hey, Tony, my man.
- You got a studio free or what?
- Yeah, two is free.
- Good. Hey, how you doing?
- Steady at 65%.
Pete. He's always busting my onions.
I send him a lot of customers, you know.
He gives me free studio time when...
What did he mean, 65%?
Oh, that... Oh, that means that he...
He scores with 65% of the chicks that come in here.
And one, two, three, two, two, three.
One, two, one, two, three.
One, two, three. Good.
Two, two, three. Good.
One, two, one, two, three.
Good, that's it.
Now do it again.
That's it, good. All right. All right. Again.
Tony, it's only dancing. Jesus.
Only dancing? Forget it, Annette.
If you're not gonna take this seriously,
I don't wanna dance.
- Don't get mad.
- "Don't get mad."
Jesus.
Look, I think we done enough dancing for today.
So, why don't we... Why don't we dance Wednesday, all right?
Yeah. Sure.
- All right. Here.
- You walking home now?
No. I'm gonna stick around and talk to Peter a little bit, and, you know, work on some stuff myself.
- I'll see you later, all right?
- Yeah.
You was good today.
Hi. How you doing?
Hey, you know, you're a very good dancer, you know that?
I would like to meet you.
Look, would you...
Would you mind just going away, okay?
- What?
- Don't be hurt, but I...
Don't be hurt?
Yeah, I wanna be by myself now, you know?
Listen, I seen you at 2001 the other night.
Yeah, so? So?
Well, I mean, you was looking at me and I was looking at you, remember?
Well, what is this? I look at a guy longer than a millionth of a second, already, he gets delusions of grandeur.
You know what you are?
I'm gonna tell you what you are.
I bet it begins with a "C," Mr. P.
Oh, fine. Fine. That's...
I know the type. I know the type. Fine.
What you doing up so late?
What is this? I walk in, you don't got no criticism of me?
- Your brother's upstairs.
- You're kidding.
- Yo, Frankie!
- Tony.
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hiya, kid.
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.
Yeah. You look good.
No, I don't. You do. You look wonderful.
- You checking out my trophy?
- Oh, yeah. That's you, huh?
- Yeah.
- "First prize."
Looks just like you.
Hey, what did you say to them downstairs?
They look crazy, they look like zombies, like...
Like somebody died or something.
I think they're in shock, Tony.
In shock?
Well, how come they're in shock?
I'm leaving the church, Tony.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Leaving the church.
- Tell me another one.
- I'm leaving the priesthood.
Oh, come on, Frank.
Don't fool around like that.
Do you think I'm losing my hair?
It looks awful thin right over here and here.
Are you serious?
Can I borrow some of your clothes until I buy some?
I don't want to wear the uniform.
I'm sorry, Frank. I really am. I'm sorry.
What are you sorry about?
You got fired, huh?
I didn't get fired. I quit.
You quit?
Yeah, you can do those things, you know.
What did Mom say?
What did she say about it?
She said, "Dear Lord, what am I gonna tell Theresa and Marie?"
- And Dad? What did he say about it?
- They're ashamed, the both of them.
They're ashamed, right?
You ashamed of me, Tony?
Yeah, you are.
- They didn't ask why or nothing?
- No.
I think they're afraid to.
Like, I might say, "celibacy."
But...
You gonna sleep here tonight?
You wanna sleep in my room?
- Yeah, I thought I would.
- All right, you can...
I'll get your blankets for you.
Frank, how come you left? Really?
It's not easy to explain, Anthony.
A lot of things.
One day, you look at a crucifix, and all you see is a man dying on a cross.
But that's only a backdrop to something else.
Mama and Papa, their dreams of pious glory.
They turn you into what they wish at a time...
You can't defend yourself against their fantasies.
All I ever really had any belief in was their image of me as a priest.
That's all.
Guess we're gonna have to take your picture down from the mantle.
Know what's weird?
Like, I always felt like
I was the shit of the family, and you was always, like, perfect.
Now that I'm the disgrace to the family,
I'm not so perfect anymore.
So, maybe you're not shit anymore.
Yeah, maybe if you ain't so good,
I ain't so bad, you know?
Yeah.
Ha.
- Give me the groceries, motherfucker.
- Hey, come on.
- Hey, don't take my groceries, man.
- I'm hungry.
- I'm hungry, Gus.
- Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, come on! Hey, come on!
Hey, don't eat the apple!
- Give me... Give me it back.
- Here.
Jesus.
What's the matter with you anyway?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
My brother, he quit the Church.
You believe that?
- Yeah?
- I feel...
I feel wild. I got all this energy.
I can't believe it.
Yeah?
Hey, listen, I'll call you later tonight, all right?
Yeah, we'll do... Hey!
- See you later, Gus.
- I'll see you.
Come on, honey, higher with the arms.
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, do it to me!
Pete, she come in?
I told you on the phone, she comes in on Tuesday.
- I know. So, did she come in or what?
- And what is it today, huh?
- It's Tuesday.
- Yeah.
Hey, Ton! Watch it, man.
That one's practicing to be a bitch.
Come on, people!
Good, yeah. Oh, that's good.
You're doing great. Yeah.
Hello, Stephanie Mangano.
I'm Tony Manero.
We both got the same last initials.
How do you like that?
Wow. We get married,
I don't have to change the monogram on my luggage, huh?
Somebody told me you was practicing to be a bitch.
Is that true?
All right, Mr. Manero.
What do you want to ask me?
I would like to take you out to coffee.
Would that be good?
That's it, huh?
You want me to have coffee with you?
I think you're a very good dancer.
You know that 2001 Odyssey, they got a dance contest now.
And I think that we could be a dynamite team together.
- How old are you, huh?
- I'm 20.
Well, I'm 19 at the moment, but I'll be 20 very shortly.
What I think is this.
There's a world of difference between us, you know?
Not just chronologically, but emotionally, culturally, physically, every which way.
And this world would get much bigger and much worse with every passing week.
What kind of shit is that?
- Coffee, not sex.
- Just coffee, huh?
See, look, where I work, the people are very remarkable.
They're not like these here
Bay Ridge people at all.
You mean snobs instead of slobs, right?
- What?
- Nothing.
Hey, you know, Bay Ridge ain't the worst part of Brooklyn.
You know what I'm talking?
I mean, you know, it ain't like a hellhole or nothing.
Yeah, well, it ain't Manhattan.
It isn't Manhattan.
You got no idea how it changes, you know.
Just right over there, right across the river, everything is different, completely different.
It's beautiful, just beautiful.
The people are beautiful, offices are beautiful.
The secretaries, you know, they all shop at Bonwit Teller.
Oh, yeah?
And, like, the lunch hours are beautiful, too.
Like, you know, they'll give you, like, two hours for lunch
- to do something that's related.
- Oh, yeah?
Like we've seen
Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet.
Over here. Romeo and Juliet, yeah?
I read that in high school.
That's... That's Shakespeare, right?
No, it's Zeffirelli, the director of the movie.
- You know, the movie? Film.
- Yeah.
You know what?
What I never understood about that Romeo and Juliet,
I never understood why Romeo, he took the poison so quick, you know?
I feel like he could have waited or something.
Well, that's the way they took the poison in those days.
Hey, you gonna eat?
Here, look at a menu.
No, no. I'll just have tea.
Tea with lemon.
I started drinking tea recently, you know.
It's really a lot more refined.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
All those women executives in my office, they all drink tea with lemon.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. And you notice that I do, too.
- I like coffee, you know? I drink coffee.
- Yeah.
You see, like, I've only been at this agency a really short time, but already I'm functioning in a, kind of, public relations capacity, you know.
I fill in for the agents when they're elsewhere.
Like, this week, you know, I had...
I had business lunches with Eric Clapton at La Cote Basque
- and Cat Stevens at Le Madrigal.
- Oh, far out.
Yeah. You heard of those restaurants, huh?
No, I don't know those exact restaurants.
I know the type.
Yeah, but you must have heard of the artists.
No, I... Not... I don't know... You know.
Not really.
So what did you say "far out" for, huh?
'Cause it sounded, like, far out.
Wasn't it? I mean...
- Well, yeah.
- We'd like a lemon with some tea now.
And I'd like a cheeseburger and some coffee.
Hey, you know who came in the office the other day?
- Who?
- Laurence Olivier.
Who's that?
Who's Laurence Olivier?
You don't know who he is?
Laurence Olivier, man!
He's the greatest actor in the whole world.
Oh, come on, you know who he is.
He's the English actor, the one on television who does all those Polaroid commercials.
You know, Laurence Olivier.
- Oh, him. Oh, he's good. He is good.
- Yeah.
Well, anyway, he comes in the office, right?
So, I just do a few errands for him.
So, he goes around, he tells everybody in the entire office, he says I'm the brightest,
I'm the most vivacious thing in the entire office he's seen in years.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Do you think that you could get, like, a camera from him at a discount?
I didn't ask him about a camera.
'Cause you got one already, right, you sly fox, you.
Hey, look, are you enjoying all this stuff I'm telling you?
Sure. I think it's good.
Well, I just think maybe you can't handle hearing about a kind of life that is so completely different than yours.
- You mean "better," don't you?
- Yes, I mean better. Sure, it's better.
Can I have some ketchup, please?
I mean, I'm out of this scene almost completely, you know, this Bay Ridge scene.
I'm moving into Manhattan.
I'm getting my own apartment.
I'm changing.
I'm really changing as a person, and I'm growing.
You know what I mean? Nobody has any idea how much I'm growing.
Why don't you go on a diet?
Okay, listen. I like you.
We could dance together.
That's it. We could just dance together and nothing more.
Nothing personal.
I don't want you coming on to me.
Why not?
Because I don't date guys like you anymore, for one thing.
You're too young, you haven't got any class, and, yeah,
I'm sick of jerk-off guys ain't got their shit together!
Oh, come on.
It's easy to get your shit together.
All you need is a salad bowl and a potato masher.
Get your shit together.
- Would you like to know what I do?
- It's not necessary.
I'll tell you what I do.
I work in a paint store, and I got a raise this week.
Right. You work in a paint store, right?
You probably live with your family, you hang out with your buddies, and on Saturday night you go, you blow it all off at 2001, right?
- That's right.
- You're a cliché.
You're nowhere, on your way to no place.
What do you got?
A fucking stairway to the stars or what?
- Yeah, maybe.
- Yeah.
I'm taking a course, nights, at the new school.
Next semester, I'm gonna take two.
Now, you, you probably didn't get no college, did you?
No, I did not.
Well, did you ever think about going to college?
- No.
- Not ever?
- No. Did you?
- Well, not back then, no...
Then why the fuck are you bugging me about it for?
Well, why not? Why didn't you ever want to go to college?
- Oh, just fuck off, will you? I did not.
- No, really. Tell me. Why not?
Oh, Jesus Christ! I didn't!
The thing is the high I get at 2001 is just dancing, it's not being the best or nothing like that.
The only thing is that I would like to get that high someplace else in my life. You know?
Like where?
I don't know where.
I don't know. Someplace.
You see, dancing, it can't last forever.
It's a short-lived kind of thing.
But I'm getting older, you know.
You know, I feel like...
I feel like, you know, so what, I'm getting older.
Does that mean, like, I can't feel that way about nothing left in my life?
You know? Is that it?
Listen, we gotta split here.
No, I'll walk you the rest of the way.
No, I'll meet you at the dance studio, just like we said, okay?
Stephanie, I can walk you home.
Look, nothing personal, right?
Oh, come on, Stephanie. I can walk you.
Oh, Jesus Christ! You know?
I don't know where he is.
- Did you call him?
- No.
What's the matter? What's going on?
It's Gus, man. He's in the hospital.
The spics got him.
- Spanish Barons?
- Barracudas.
- Hey, that's my fucking car!
- Forget the car!
- Save it for the spics.
- Just give me the keys.
- You're asking for it.
- I can't believe it. I just saw him.
He could have run, you know?
But he hung tight. That's Gus.
Don't worry about it. Okay? All right?
I got in the hospital to see him.
He got a broken nose, busted ribs, a broken leg and four teeth knocked out.
Shit.
I mean, all he was doing was walking along the street carrying his groceries, and three of them do a shove number on him.
They spill his fucking groceries into the street.
So, he says under his breath,
"grease balls, spic dicks," and they laid into him.
All right. Go check it out.
Nobody in there, man.
All right, all right.
This is what we're gonna do.
We're just gonna cruise around until there's enough of them that we can handle.
Yeah, yeah, we'll just pick off a couple on the street.
- That's pussy, man!
- Fuck, man. Fuck.
- You're fucked up!
- I'm sorry, guys.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You're sorry.
Oh, forget it. We'll get them tomorrow.
All right, dream good. Jerk off better.
Tony, I'm getting married.
Will you cut it with that shit?
No, listen.
I just wanted to let you know, all right?
All right. Look. If you get married, we'll all go with you on your honeymoon, all right?
- You will? Okay.
- Okay, good. Take it easy.
Come on, Bobby. Get in the car.
Hey.
Hey, you know, we should go to the hospital tomorrow.
You know what I'm talking?
And you, cool off! You know?
All right. Good night.
Tony, what did you say to Father Frank, Jr.?
- What?
- What did you say? What did you do?
Yeah, what did you say?
- What are you talking about?
- You must have said something to him.
You sleep in the same room.
You talk to him.
The next night he stays out all night, he don't come back.
- I said nothing to him.
- A priest staying out all night.
A priest is not a priest no more, and he's grown up, so he can do what he wants.
Something you said to him.
Oh, yeah? You try and blame me now he ain't a priest no more?
You been writing to him.
I don't believe this.
You're trying to hang this on me?
Forget it, all right?
He called. He called. He called.
In a couple of days he's gonna see he's wrong.
He's going through, like, a trial of the soul, you know?
He's going back to the church.
He's going back.
No, he won't.
He's not going back to the church.
Yes he is.
He's going back to the church!
I'm telling you, he's going back!
You know what?
You don't got a priest no more!
And you got no saint!
You got nothing but three shit children now!
Good. Good.
No.
I'm sorry, Mom.
I just...
I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.
I'll never say that.
I love you, Mom. I really do.
Go on. Get out of here.
- How you doing, Annette?
- Okay.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
Hey, listen, look, Annette.
I gotta tell you something, all right?
It's very hard to tell you this, but...
I changed my mind about us dancing together.
I got another partner.
Look, it's professional.
You know what I mean? It's like...
Things like this happen when it's professional.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My fucking mother, now you.
Why do you hate me so much?
All I ever did to you was like you.
Give me a break, huh?
Hi.
You're late.
Five minutes. That's not late.
How long you been here?
I don't know.
Six, seven, something like that.
Pete said you been here 15.
Well, who's he?
Hey, I got some records over here.
I don't know if you like them or not.
- You like these guys?
- Yeah, yeah. Super.
Do you do the New York hustle, the Latin hustle, what?
- New York, Latin, I do it all.
- Okay.
Follow me this time.
Yeah, that's really nice.
What'd you do, make that up?
Yeah. Yeah. No, I saw it on TV first.
Then I made it up.
Hey, you know what? I know this one.
What I do is...
Wait a minute. This is simple.
Let me just check something out.
- Come on. Come on.
- What you doing?
Okay, stay right there.
Now we can dance.
Let me show you the step, okay?
The Latin one I was gonna show you, okay?
Now, take your hand like this, and count one, two, three.
Two, two, three.
Three, two, three, kick, two, three.
- Okay, I got that.
- Okay?
- Looks good.
- All right.
- That's good. I like that.
- Yeah.
- Do you know the tango hustle?
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay, let's try that.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yeah.
No, no. Look, I really gotta go home.
You know something?
I like you when you're like this.
When you're quiet and you ain't laying all that shit on me and everything.
Oh, yeah? Well, as a matter of fact, guess who I had lunch with today?
Paul Anka.
I had to open my big mouth, right?
It was very interesting.
Very interesting. Very interesting.
Very, very intelligent fellow.
You cream over that word,
"interesting," don't you?
- Well, what's wrong with "interesting"?
- I don't know, something.
You know, I want to tell you something.
I've never told you this before, but I think you're full of shit.
- Oh, you do, do you, huh?
- Yeah, except I'm not sure.
I'm not sure how much is just shit and how much is bullshit.
Well, listen, when you figure it out, just let me know, all right?
We should really practice a couple more times.
Maybe go to 2001 with a crowd.
How about Saturday?
Would that be good?
Maybe.
Stephanie, I wanna ask you something, all right?
I don't know how to say this.
Do you think that I am either interesting or intelligent?
Interesting? Yeah. Yeah.
Intelligent?
I don't know. Maybe.
I don't know. I gotta know you better.
You know what I mean?
You got a way of putting things together, you know?
Seeing things a certain way.
Interesting? Yeah, yeah.
Intelligent? Yeah, maybe.
Maybe intelligent.
Well, what do you know?
All right.
Hey, Stephanie, how come we never talk about how we feel when we're dancing?
- How come we never talk about that?
- Good night and thanks.
No, maybe I could walk you the rest of the way.
- Let me do that.
- Nope.
You shouldn't have asked.
You should have just done it.
Oh, hot stuff, Jesus.
- Hey, what's happening, Tony?
- Bob, what's up. My brother, Frank.
Hey, how you doing? Double J.
Hey, how you doing?
- Come on up to the table over there.
- Oh, okay.
You guys have the Moses effect.
You arrive and the crowd parts like the Red Sea.
They know we're the faces, that's all.
- How do you like it, Father?
- What father? I look like your father?
Please don't call me that.
I never could stand that.
But, yeah, I think the place is, you know, energizing.
- It's all right, huh?
- Great.
Good place.
- Tony.
- Hey.
Hey.
Are you as good in bed as you are on that dance floor?
Well, are you?
Are you as good in bed as you are on the dance floor?
- Hey, he never made it in a bed.
- Watch this.
This ain't my regular partner, but you'll see.
Ton, what are you gonna have to drink?
We'll get you something, huh?
- Seven and Seven.
- Seven and Seven.
So, when's Connie gonna get her answer, huh?
- You know, Connie.
- Yeah.
If you're as good in bed as you are on the dance floor,
I'll bet you're one lousy fuck.
So, how come they always send me flowers the next day, huh?
You know, some guys don't know a lousy fuck when they got one.
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah?
Maybe they thought you was dead.
Father, wanna hear something? Listen.
I got a girlfriend of mine, you know.
She's such a good Catholic, Father.
She tells me she loves the taste of communion wafers.
Hey, Mr. Manero, could I talk to you for a sec?
- Hey, what's he doing?
- Frank.
Frank, yeah, Frank, yeah. Listen...
Oh, forget this.
Look out. Give the kid some room.
He's taking over again.
- All right!
- All right!
Go, go!
Right on.
There he goes.
- Okay, babe.
- There he goes.
Go, Tony!
Yeah!
Oh, yeah.
- He's very good, yeah.
- He's the king out there, Father.
- He's the best.
- Hey, man, he's great. He's great.
You know, man?
Listen, can I talk to you for a second, Father?
Yes, but call me Frank.
Frank? Frank, listen. Come here.
You wanna hear something? Listen.
I got... My girlfriend, you know...
Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.
- Come here for a sec.
Listen, Frank. Wanna hear something?
I got a lot of ideas. You see, like,
I was reading up about the Pope.
- Hey, Father?
- Yeah, sure. Frank, Frank.
Frank. Yeah, Frank. Yeah, Frank.
Okay, Frank. Listen, Frank,
I got a girlfriend, you know?
She's Pauline.
Her name's Pauline. And...
Yeah. What do you mean, you got her...
Did you get her pregnant?
Yes, I did. Yes. Yes, I did.
She loves the taste of communion wafers.
Well, I got a lot of ideas, you know, swimming around in my head.
And I was reading a lot of stuff lately.
I heard, like, the Pope, he gives special,
- you know...
- Dispensation.
Yeah. Do you think the Pope could give Pauline an abortion?
You mean give you a dispensation for an abortion?
Yeah, you think you could do this?
I don't think so, Bobby.
Well, maybe, you know, maybe you could do it for me.
- Maybe?
- I'm sorry, Bobby. I don't think so.
I was just thinking.
Have you talked to your priest about it?
Yeah, I talk to everybody about it.
I talked to a lot of people.
A lot of people. A lot of people.
All right, thank you.
Thanks a lot. All right?
You play, you pay. It's funny, huh?
Don't forget, everybody.
You could win, too, man.
Disco Universe sweepstakes, just a week away.
500 bucks. 500 big ones.
- Do you know Stephanie Mangano?
- No.
- No?
- I know Stephanie.
- Did she come in yet?
- No, she didn't get in yet.
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
Right, right. Don't forget again, baby,
Universal Disco sweepstakes, just a week away.
Tony! Tony, that was really great.
- Oh, you liked it?
- Yeah.
Listen, I'm gonna go home now.
All right?
- You're gonna go home?
- Yeah.
No, no, stay a little longer, Frank.
The night's just beginning.
Yeah, I know, but it's not my scene, you know?
Come on. You didn't expect me to stay the whole night, did you?
No, no. I didn't...
Yes, I thought maybe you'd stay a little longer.
- No, it's not your scene. Of course not.
- I'm sorry, Tony.
Don't worry about it.
It's nothing, you know.
So what, right? Come on.
I'll walk you to the door.
Hey, you know, your dancing is really marvelous.
It's exciting. I mean, it's exciting to watch you out there.
They can't keep their eyes off of you.
Look, I got to go now, okay?
I'll see you later.
All right, well, have a good night.
I'll see you later. All right?
Yeah, you, too.
Hey, she come in or what?
Hey, you just asked me, and I told you she isn't here.
- Tony, your brother, is he okay?
- He's fine.
He just had a stomach thing.
I don't know.
Just the two of them.
- We could make it now.
- What?
We ain't practicing, seeing each other like you said, so we could make it.
Look, Annette, we make it when I decide, all right?
No other time.
- All right.
- When I say so, all right?
I'll just make it with somebody else.
Who? Who?
Somebody. I don't care. Anybody here.
- Oh, somebody here?
- Yeah.
Double J, Joey.
Oh, the fuck you will.
Hey, look. Hey, Bobby.
Look, we're gonna go out to the car, and when I get back, we'll go to the bridge, all right?
You fixed?
Huh?
- You fixed?
- What do you mean?
- You know, are you on the pill or what?
- No.
No?
What do you got, the IOU, that thing?
- Huh?
- No.
No diaphragm?
- Nothing?
- It doesn't matter, though.
- You don't got nothing?
- It doesn't matter. Tony, I love you.
Are you kidding me?
Oh, forget it. Oh, fuck.
Just give me a blowjob.
Ready? Come on.
- Just a minute.
- Hey, Tony!
Forget it. Forget it. Just fix yourself up.
Everything was cool.
Everything was all right.
You had a good time.
Annette, cigarette?
Guess not, huh?
Stupid goofs.
Hey, Annette, can you dig it?
I knew that you could.
- Joey!
- You're fucked, Double J.
- Hey, Tony.
- What?
Come on.
Let's get this selfish motherfucker.
- All right.
- Let's push him off.
- All right.
- You're going in, you big, fucking hump!
Come on, Ton. Let's get him.
Come on. Let's go. Shit.
Hey, come on, let's get the fucking show off and throw him the fuck off.
Hey, Tarzan!
Look out, Double J!
Don't worry about nothing! I'm coming!
You fuckers!
- Can you dig it? I knew that you could.
- I knew that you could.
You stupid bitch.
I wish you was staying longer, you know, Frank?
Ex-priests don't stay back home.
Listen, everyone's too shocked and disgraced.
A family raises a priest, they think they've scored points in heaven,
- and now they're gonna lose them.
- Hey, Frank. How you doing?
Okay. We better get a move on.
I gotta pick some people on the way.
Okay. Listen, we gotta keep in touch.
Yeah. You gonna like this settlement house?
What do you think?
- It'll do until I figure out my next move.
- Yeah.
- What about you?
- What about me?
Are you gonna do something with your dancing, Tony?
I don't know.
People ask me all the time.
But I don't know, I mean, you know,
I feel like my whole life, right,
I've been told I'm the no-good in the family and that...
Tony, the only way you're gonna survive is to do what you think is right, not what they keep trying to jam you into.
You let them do that and you're gonna end up nothing but miserable.
Huh?
- Hey, have a good trip, all right?
- Yeah.
I left you something in your room.
- What did you leave me?
- A souvenir.
Money?
Leave me money.
So, what are you standing there for?
How come you wasn't there
Saturday night?
I didn't say I was gonna be there
Saturday night.
- The fuck you didn't.
- I said maybe. Maybe's a maybe.
I didn't think you'd go and get upset about it.
Oh, forget upset. I'm not upset.
It's just that we needed the practice.
I mean, you know, you should've been there.
All right, right, let's practice then.
We can't.
I didn't bring the records 'cause
I didn't think you was gonna be here.
Yeah? So what did you come for, huh?
- Stugats. You know "stugats"?
- Yeah, I know "stugats".
All right, we'll use some of this stuff.
"If you're not of a mind to break up..."
What's up?
We've been waiting, man.
Pete said you was practicing, you know.
Hey, Tony, we were cruising you know who. Looking good.
Not now. Don't talk about it now.
Talk about it later.
Stephanie, this is Joey, this is Double J, this is Bobby C.
- How you doing, Stephanie?
- How do you do?
- You a dancer?
- Yeah.
- You hungry?
- Yeah.
What do you wanna eat, huh?
- I'm gonna change and then...
- All right.
What maracas. She's got maracas.
She's got nice tits.
It's like,
I'm gonna be traveling, you know.
Promotional tours with authors and performers.
Of course, I'm gonna hate to leave Manhattan, even briefly.
There's certain ballets and concerts
I'm just gonna have to miss.
Tell them about the people who come into the office.
That's what they wanna hear.
Tell them that.
Oh, you know who came in today?
This guy, David Bowie.
- He comes in, has this Astrakhan coat...
- He's a fagot.
- He's a half-fagot, man.
- Hey, relax! Come on. Sit down.
You mean, he's a bisexual.
Yeah, he swings both ways.
Men and boys.
- What's so funny?
- Oh yeah?
Well, you know who came in today?
Joe Namath. You know Joe Namath?
He comes in and he wants some coffee, so I brought him coffee.
And then he asked me to sit down, have some coffee with him.
You had coffee with Joe Namath?
Yeah, that's right.
We were talking a little bit.
He wanted to know what it was like to be 21.
I told him I didn't know
'cause I was just 20.
- Yeah, what else?
- That's all.
Ain't that enough?
Hey, don't you never chew, Tony?
Don't you never chew?
Hey, look, when my mother dies,
I'll give you the job, all right?
You know what's going down your throat, man?
Big chunks of hamburger, you know.
Big gobs, like dog food, dog friskies, dog yummies.
You know something, Joey?
He's gonna turn into a dog.
Stephanie, listen, can I talk to you for a second?
I was listening to what you said in there before, and you seem to know a lot of people, and a lot of places and a lot of things.
I got a friend of mine, you know, he's a very good friend of mine and he got a girl pregnant.
He got a girl pregnant, and I wanted to know if you had to make a choice between getting an abortion and have to get married to somebody, what would you do?
Well, who would I have to marry?
You'd have to marry me.
You'd have to marry me. Yeah.
I think I'd get an abortion.
Hey, so long, Tony.
It's very nice meeting you.
So, what'd you guys think of her?
Hey, Tony, I liked her.
I thought she was nice. I liked her a lot.
She's a snotty bitch, man.
She's cool.
You just gotta get to know her, that's all.
Hey, Ton, did you fuck her, yet?
- What do you think?
- I don't think so.
You know, you guys got a lot of growing up to do, you know that?
A lot of growing up. You're babies.
Yeah.
Hey, Mr. Fusco, look,
I need the afternoon off.
Sam's out. Harold's sick.
Here, take these.
- But I gotta, Mr. Fusco.
- Sorry, Tony.
Look, all I'm asking for is one afternoon off.
I've been here almost eight months.
I didn't miss a day yet!
- Not today, Tony.
- Oh, come on, Mr. Fusco.
Some of those old farts, they miss three, four days at a time, you don't say nothing to them.
Hey, cool off.
Look, I got to have the afternoon off.
I'm taking it.
- You do, you're fired.
- I'm doing it.
- Then you're fired!
- Then fuck you, asshole!
And the fuck horse you rode in on.
- Fucking cocksucker asshole!
- Tony.
Tony, I don't wanna marry Pauline.
I don't give a fuck about this cunt.
- So, don't marry her!
- Tony, I gotta marry her!
Fuck it. She won't get the abortion.
- Everyone says I gotta marry her, Tony.
- Who says that?
Oh, fuck, her fucking parents, my fucking parents.
The fucking priest on the corner.
Her fucking high school guidance counselor.
Tony, I'm paralyzed.
I got no more control.
I mean, you and me, Tony, we've been friends for so long.
I mean, I'm hurting.
Shit! You're always together.
And I'm always fucking up, and you're always all right. You know?
I... Oh, come on.
Everybody fucks up. Really.
- Don't worry about nothing.
- You know, you're great.
I'm in a terrible rush.
I hate to leave you like this.
You got no idea how much I appreciate this.
I mean, this car's very important for me today, you know?
- Will you call me tonight?
- Yeah, I'll call you.
Don't worry about nothing, all right?
Take care.
- I'll talk to you later then?
- Yeah.
- Call me tonight, right?
- Yeah.
You're gonna call me tonight?
You know, Stephanie, this got me fired.
- What?
- This got me fired.
You know, you couldn't do it on Sunday, so, my boss, he fired me.
Well, I just wanted to get everything in, you know, so I could start fixing up when I move in on Saturday.
Yeah.
Nobody bitched at my office.
I got the whole day off.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Oh, it's all right. No problem.
No big deal. I can handle it.
Yeah, come on in.
Now, put that over here.
Hey!
I thought you were gonna be out of town.
I postponed the trip.
Jay, this is Tony Manero. He's a friend.
- Tony, this is Jay Langhart.
- Unspecified status.
How do you do?
Well, I've decided to leave you all the furniture.
What, are you kidding?
You're not gonna take any of this stuff?
No, I'm gonna start fresh. What the hell, you picked out most of it anyway.
- Well, super.
- Stephanie, I told you not to say "super."
Nobody says "super" anymore.
Can I get you a beer? Glass of wine?
No, man, it's all right.
Hey, I read that book you told me to.
You know, the...
Kerr or the Lawson?
- The Kerr.
- Should have read the Lawson.
Listen, if I can help you guys move in, you just say the word. Be glad to help.
I'll get the rest of the stuff.
Stephanie, who is that guy?
He's an arranger, a record producer.
He wants to do films.
He's gonna move now to a more expensive apartment.
I met him at the agency.
He didn't want his wife to know how much money he had until the divorce was final.
Come on. Let's go.
I mean, who is he to you, Stephanie?
That's what I'm talking about.
He's a friend of mine, okay?
He's a friend.
And I was living with him for a little while.
Are you in love with this man or what?
I mean, tell me the story.
- That's all I'm asking, is the story.
- No, I'm not. We had a thing.
You know?
It didn't work out, and it's over now, and he's my friend, and he still likes me.
He likes you. He likes you to have...
To have you around for a quick piece when he feels like it.
He helped me, man. You don't know what it's like at that place.
It's crazy. You don't know shit!
You know? I didn't know how to do stuff, so I'd go to him and I would ask him, and he would tell me how to do things.
And then I'd go back to work and everything would be all right.
Otherwise, I'd be walking around like an idiot, going, "I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know."
- And he helps me. He does.
- Yeah, he helps you. Helps you what?
Get in and out of the sack?
Is that what he helps you do?
- He helped me.
- Sure.
What the hell do you expect me to do, man?
What do you expect me to do?
He helped me.
Don't cry about it. I mean, you know.
All right, so he helped you.
That's good for you.
All right. Come on. Let's get out of here.
I'm sorry.
It's all right. Don't worry about nothing.
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about nothing.
Stephanie, don't.
Look, we'll stop here for a while.
We'll sit down. All right?
Don't stop. Just take me home.
Just take me home, man.
No, come on, we'll sit here for a while, all right?
Just, don't worry about nothing.
It's pretty, isn't it?
Sit down.
You know how tall that bridge is?
That bridge, that tower right there, goes up 690 feet.
They got 40 million cars going across there a year.
127,000 tons of steel is involved in that.
The concrete there, they got almost three-quarter of a million yards of concrete.
That's right.
The center span, right there, is 4,260 feet long.
And with the on-ramps, it all together totals, like, something like 2.5 miles.
You know all about the bridge, don't you?
That's right.
I know everything about that bridge.
You know what else?
They got a guy buried in the cement.
Yeah?
Know how it happened?
Well, they was working on it, apparently, at the time.
And they, I guess, they were pouring the cement, and he slipped off, you know, on the upper part of the bridge and, you know, fell in.
Dumb fuck.
- What a way to go.
- I come down here a lot.
You know, I get ideas.
Oh, yeah? What kind of ideas you get?
I don't know, daydreams, you know?
I daydream a lot.
Mr. Fusco, I come for what I got coming.
Tony. Come on.
Things got a little hot under the collar, don't you think?
What are you talking about?
I don't want to lose you, Tony.
You're a good kid.
Customers like you.
I want you to stay on.
- You mean, I ain't fired?
- No. Come on. Here.
- Jesus Christ. I don't believe this.
- You got a future here, Tony.
Here, Harold's with me 18 years, since I opened.
Mike, 15 years, huh?
Come on, now. Give Harold a hand, huh? He's making a mess.
Pete, what are you doing?
Trying to get up to 70%?
Whoa, man.
I didn't know you hung your label on her.
What are you doing?
That guy's the biggest cunt hound in Bay Ridge.
Oh, my God.
I've been in serious danger.
It's no fucking joke, Stephanie.
That guy's a fucking sleazy whore.
I was dancing with the fella.
You know? Dancing.
- No, no. No, forget it.
- Come on. Let's dance, huh?
You disgust me, you know that?
- Well, what do you mean?
- Forget it.
- Forget it.
- Tony, I was just dancing with the guy.
Tony! Tony!
- Annette, what do you want?
- Just look. Look.
Oh, Jesus.
Beautiful, man. They got six or seven of them in there and a couple of chicks.
Listen, why don't we wait till they get down to about three, four people?
- Yeah, one or two?
- Tony!
- All right. I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
- Tony, listen, you gotta help...
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Back up, all right?
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Double J?
- Trying to back it up!
- What are you, crazy?
- Tony, I'm gonna get married.
- Shut up!
Come on, fuckers!
Tony!
Tony! Tony, help me! Please, God!
Hey, what the hell you think you're doing, huh?
Ton!
Ton! Come here, it's me! Come on!
- Let's get out of here.
- You okay?
Jesus!
He chickened, man! Where is he?
Go, man! Go!
- Where the hell were you, huh?
- Tony, I was just driving around.
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- I was looking for you. Where were you?
Hey, Gus. Did you get the number of the truck that hit you?
Don't make me laugh, all right?
Do not make me laugh.
- Look at this. We don't love you, right?
- Right.
- We got them.
- Does that hurt?
Yeah, really, huh?
Hey, you guys really, you know, you really kicked their asses?
Hey, come on, we got them where they breathe, Italian style.
Yeah, that's great, you know.
Only, you know,
I ain't so sure it was the Barracudas.
Dr. Allison to Emergency.
Hey, what are you talking about?
You said it was.
No, I said it probably was.
Don't be pulling our legs now.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- You said it probably was.
- Yeah, I said probably.
- That's what you told us.
- I said probably 'cause I wasn't sure.
You know? I mean, it could've been a Spanish...
Stupid, fucking bastard.
- We almost got our heads busted.
- Yeah, not you, lover.
You know, you got some fucking pair of balls on you, you know that, Gus?
- Hey, hey, come on.
- You know that?
Hey, you know, I had to say something.
Right? I had to lay somebody out for it.
What are you, stupid?
You can't see who hurt you, right?
Oh, my God, what are you doing?
If I said I didn't know who it was, they would have got off. Come on.
Yeah, well, fuck you, Gus.
You know what I feel like doing?
I feel like breaking your broken leg.
That's what I feel like doing.
- Hey, come on.
- Let's get out of here.
Oh, God, I can't believe this whole fucking thing.
You wanna know something?
I could have killed him.
- You couldn't kill a fucking crab lice.
- Oh, shit, what do you think I am?
- You think I'm a coward?
- What do you think you are?
Enough of that shit, already. I'm bored.
I'm bored with it, all right?
Hey, hey. Jeez, look at this.
You're beautiful, babe.
Hey, come on. We got the winners here.
Let's get a table. Let's go.
Yeah. Let's get a table.
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.
What happened to your face, huh?
I cut myself shaving.
With a switchblade, huh?
Come on.
Climb aboard my magic carpet and let us take a ride to the oasis.
Feel the power.
Open sesame.
A big hand for Shirley and Charles Tuck.
Give them a big hand.
Come on, everybody.
What are you booing?
Come on, be cool, everybody.
No way. No good. No way.
Yes!
Now we have Stephanie Mangano and Tony Manero!
Come on.
All right.
Joey, hey, give me another one of those, huh?
Hey, come on, you had enough.
Come on. I like it.
They're good. Come on.
All right. Get high.
You know, it's your head.
- That's right.
- Here you go.
Right on! That is the money.
Hey! Hey, be cool, baby!
Here now, we have couple number 15, the Puerto Ricans...
Wrong neighborhood, huh?
Tony, listen to me, you're gonna take the prize.
Jesus Christ. They're so fucking good.
How could they be? They're spics.
Look at them greasing up the floor.
Numero uno!
No contest, man. No contest.
I don't want to hear that shit.
They was fucking better than us.
They weren't better, they was different, that's all. Just different.
- Bullshit.
- All right, folks!
We have the decision of the judges.
In third place, we have Elizabeth and Joseph Cursa!
Give them a hand!
Baby!
Come on, baby.
Yeah!
Second prize!
From Puerto Rico, we have
Cesar Rodriguez, Maria Huerta!
- You're doing them a favor!
- They're gonna take the prize.
- Thank you.
- Unbelievable!
- Don't spend it in one place, baby.
- Thank you.
In first place, the coolest, the Fred Astaire of Brooklyn, the boogie-woogie man, the man who gave you coolness, hotness and everything you wanted.
He was hot! He was right on!
Stephanie Mangano and Tony Manero.
We won.
Come on. Come on!
Didn't I tell you?
Won.
Come on, let's boogie.
Come on, everybody.
It's over. Come on, let's dance.
Come on, everybody!
Man, you put them down, is what you did, huh?
You phony bastards!
You know who should have won that contest.
My own fucking friends can't even be straight with me.
You gotta lie right through your fucking teeth.
- Come on!
- What's up your ass, man?
- Look, we won it.
- Stephanie, that was rigged.
That's like family. They can't give it to no spic or no stranger.
What are you, crazy?
We was just as good as they were, Tony, and I know it.
- Oh, you think so, huh?
- Yeah!
Here. Come with me.
Excuse me. Congratulations. Here.
I'd like to give this,
I'd like to give you that,
'cause I think you deserve it, all right?
Come on.
God damn it! Good is good.
If the spics are good, they deserve it.
- That's all there is to it.
- Yeah, but we won it. They didn't.
This is a fucking shit hole, you know that? A fucking shit hole!
God damn it.
My friends, the assholes I hang out with,
I can't believe them sometimes.
You know that?
Everybody's gotta dump on somebody, right? Of course.
I mean, everybody...
Everybody can't do it straight, right?
My pa goes to work, he gets dumped on, so he comes home and he dumps on my mother, right?
Of course, right?
Then the spics, they dump on us, so we gotta dump on spics.
Of course, right?
Everybody's dumping on everybody.
Even the humping's dumping most of the time.
All right. Okay. Listen, would you just tell me what's wrong? Okay?
- Get in.
- What is it?
- Get in!
- Just tell me.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Wait. Stop it. Look, just stop it!
Let me alone, man!
Come on. Get away!
You know, you're such a fucking cockteaser, you know that?
Don't you fucking call me no goddamn cockteaser!
You are a cockteaser!
- Why you hanging around with me?
- Dancing, that's why.
- Oh, dancing, huh? Why else?
- Yeah!
You wanna know?
It's bullshit, that's why. Bullshit, man.
I've just been dumping my bullshit all over you, selling my act on you, using you, making you think that I love you!
It's just all bullshit, man!
- You fucking cunt!
- Don't fucking start! You stop it! Don't!
Get off of me.
Oh, Stephanie.
- I'm mad at you, Tony.
- Hey, Tony, come on.
Annette's gonna give everybody a piece of snatch pie.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah? The fuck you are.
I wanna talk to you.
- Hey, what are you doing?
- What is with you, huh?
- What's with you, you little punk?
- What are you doing?
- What is it, man? What the fuck is it?
- You don't give a shit about her!
Come on, Annette. Get in the car.
Come on. Do it.
I told you.
You can fuck all night on this speed.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, you will.
Joey, what you doing back there?
Hey, you fuck.
The first is always the best.
That's right.
Yes. Yes.
Joey?
Oh, God.
Come on, Double J. You're up.
See you guys later, huh?
- No. Joey.
- Come on, mother.
- Oh, yeah! My turn.
- No. You know what?
No, Double J. No, I don't wanna do it.
Fuck-A!
Shit. With me she's gotta cry?
- God damn, Annette. Come on.
- No. No. Don't.
Come on.
Yeah!
Fuck! Double J!
Come on, Double J! Come on!
- Give me a beer huh?
- Hey! Hey! With no pants.
And no hands!
Here, beer.
- All right!
- All right.
Fuck you, Manhattan!
Come to Brooklyn!
Mine's so big, I gotta strap it to my leg.
Anita says
I got the biggest thing in town.
Proud of yourself now?
Is that what you wanted? Good.
Now you're a cunt.
Man, don't fuck around.
What are you doing?
Where you going? Annette.
No. No. No. Leave me.
Come on, Annette. I'm sorry.
- Annette, I said I'm sorry.
- I didn't want to do it.
Look at this guy.
Hey, Bobby! Hey, you punk!
Tony! Look at me!
- Look at the punk.
- Bobby, get down. It's too dangerous.
Look at me, Tony.
Hey, Tony, look at me!
Look! Hey, Tony!
I'm not kidding, Bobby.
Get down from there.
I'm all right. I'm all right.
I'm all right, Tony.
I'm all right. Watch me.
- Hey, Tony, look at me!
- That's crazy. Now you're being crazy.
Look at me, look at me, look at me.
I'm doing it.
- It's too dangerous.
- Look at me.
- I see you.
- Look at me.
Oh, Jesus.
It's a long way down there.
- Give me your hand.
- I did it!
Come back. Come back in. Come on.
- Watch.
- Don't, don't.
You're making me very nervous now, Bobby.
Don't do that. Jesus Christ.
Get over here. Get over here, right now!
Give me your hand.
Oh, Jesus! No. No!
- Oh, come on.
- I did it.
- What did you do?
- I did it.
Watch.
Come on, Bobby. Get over here.
Right now. Come on.
Now, don't get upset.
Come on. We'll talk.
We'll go talk in the car.
It's warmer there.
You didn't talk to me before.
How come you never called me?
- I didn't wanna fuck up.
- You didn't fuck up, Bobby.
- Come on. We'll talk, all right?
- I didn't wanna fuck up this time.
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
No!
Any of you guys think maybe he killed himself?
No.
There's ways of killing yourself without killing yourself.
Yeah. Okay, you can go now.
Forget the number, Chief.
We ain't gonna find nothing out there tonight.
Shit.
Ton?
Hey, Tony!
Stephanie?
- Is that you?
- Yeah, it's me, Stephanie.
Hey, look, look,
I'm really sorry about last night.
- You're sorry?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Stephanie. I just...
Look, it won't happen again,
I promise you.
I just... I just, I really need to talk to you.
What are you talking about, you need to talk to me?
It's just like what I said.
I need to talk to you.
Okay, listen. Now, if I open this door, you're not gonna pull any funny stuff on me, right?
No, of course not.
First time I ever let a known rapist in my apartment.
Hey, look, I'll just stay right here, all right?
So, that way you don't think that I'm gonna, you know, jump you or nothing.
What's wrong with you, man?
Nothing. I'll tell you later. Right?
Well, you can’t just stand there.
This is ridiculous. Come on.
I've been up all night just walking and looking around.
And, you know,
I'm gonna get myself my own place.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm getting my money,
I'm coming back, you know.
'Cause I ain't going back there.
Wait a minute. Why don't you sit down, okay? Come on.
- So, what are you doing?
- What am I doing?
I'm just not going back there, that's all.
They're assholes back there.
- I'm fed up to here with it. It's bullshit.
- Okay. Okay.
What are you gonna do?
What do you do?
You come in. You get a job. You know.
Do what you do. Get a nice apartment.
Okay, what kind of job?
I don't know.
What did you do? You came in, you couldn't do nothing, right?
I could type when I came.
No big deal. I'm an able person.
I mean, I can do these things.
Yeah, of course you can.
Tony, I wanna tell you something.
Now, you know, I said all that stuff to you about...
Using you, practicing my act on you, you know?
It wasn't true.
There's a lot of other reasons that I was hanging around you.
- What do you mean?
- You made me feel better.
You gave me, like, admiration, you know? Respect.
Support.
Stephanie, maybe now that, you know, like, I'm gonna be in town like I planned, maybe, like, we could see each other.
No, I don't mean like that.
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking, like,
I'm promoting your pussy, but I ain't.
I mean, like, friends, right?
You know, like you once said, we could help each other.
- Wanna be friends?
- Yeah. I'd like to be friends with you.
Think you know how, huh?
Think you could be friends with a girl?
Could you stand being friends with a girl, huh?
- The truth?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know. I mean, I could try.
That's all I can say, Stephanie.
I could try.
Okay. Okay.
Let's be friends, all right?
We'll just be friends.
All right.
Okay.
Friends, man.
Someone once said if it was raining brains...
Roxy Robinson wouldn't even get wet.
Roxy spent his life making two and two into five.
He could smell trouble like others smelled gas.
But believe you me...
he shouldn't have taken that alley by Parito's bakery.
Your name Robinson?
Roxy Robinson?
You work for Fat Sam?
Whatever game it was, sure as eggs...
is eggs, Roxy the Weasel had been scrambled.
I should be filling you in.
This guy's the hero of our story.
Name of Bugsy Malone.
A nice guy, a little too popular with the broads.
Italian mother, Irish father. Grown up confused.
Kinda mixed up. By the way, my name's Sam.
Fat Sam, because of my physique.
I ain't no dumb-bell.
And this ain't no bookshop.
This is my place.
Fat Sam's Grand Slam.
Best joint in town.
- Hi, Jelly.
- Hi, Bugsy.
We interrupt this program to bring you a news flash.
We have reports of an incident on the Lower East side...
involving the man known as Roxy the Weasel.
Believed to be a member of the gang of mobster king...
Fat Sam Stacette.
Robinson was the victim of a...
sensational event.
We go over to our reporter on the spot...
So tell me.
How'd you allow this to happen?
Roxy was one of my best!
What have you got to say... you bunch of dummies?
Call yourselves hoodlums?
You're a disgrace to the profession. You hear me?
And most of all, a disgrace to me. Fat Sam.
And we all know who's behind this.
Sure do, boss.
Don't need a hatful of brains...
- do you?
- Certainly not, boss.
So who is it, dummies?
Tell me! Who?
- Dandy...
- Dan.
Don't mention that name in this office!
Take it easy, boss, sit down.
Come in.
I'm Blousey Brown. I'm a singer, for the audition.
A singer. A singer!
I don't need a singer.
Come back tomorrow.
How about my audition?
You said okay last week.
Am I going mad? Are my ears playing tricks on me?
Will you get out of here!
Dancers, dancers, surrounded by namby-pamby dancers... singers, piano players and banjo players... when I need brains.
Brains and muscles.
You've got us, boss.
You? You hunk of lard!
You got muscles where you should have brains.
My canary's got more brains than you! Dumb salami.
What's funny?
Don't worry, I've been trying to see him for months.
- You have?
- Of course.
- What do you do?
- I'm the greatest tap dancer.
- You are?
- Of course I are. Cross my heart.
But all he says is come back tomorrow.
How many times can
I come back tomorrow?
Anybody who is anybody...
will soon walk through that door.
At Fat Sam's Grand Slam speakeasy.
Always able to find you a table...
there's room for just one more at Fat Sam's Grand Slam...
speakeasy.
Once you get here, feel the cheer...
like they say in the poem...
Fat Sam ain't humble...
but it's your home sweet home.
Plans are made here...
games are played here...
I could write a book.
Each night astounds you, rumors are buzzin'...
stories by the dozen.
Look around you, cousin...
at the news we're making here.
Anybody who is anybody will soon walk through the door...
at Fat Sam's Grand Slam...
speakeasy.
There's a politician sitting by the kitchen...
said he caught his fingers in the one he was wishin'.
Once you get here, feel the cheer...

look around you, cousin, at the news we're making here.
Anybody who is anybody will soon walk through the door...
at Fat Sam's Grand Slam...
speakeasy.
You know something?
You look like you put your face on backwards this morning.
- You got too much mouth.
- I'll tell my dentist.
- Watch where you're going.
- Sorry. It's your fault.
What's that, a hockey stick?
No, a baseball bat.
You're a baseball player?
No, a dancer. My mother made me pack it.
- You a sports nut?
- It's for protection.
- You take it everywhere?
- No, I came about a job.
- You get it?
- They said come back tomorrow.
- What's your name?
- Brown.
Sounds like a loaf of bread.
Blousey Brown.
Blousey Brown?
A stale loaf of bread.
Very funny. Terrific.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Bugsy Malone.
Don't call us.
We'll call you.
It's okay, everybody.
Just a little excitement.
Razzmatazz, music. I wanna see everyone enjoying themselves.
Can't say Fat Sam's place ain't the liveliest joint in town.
Knuckles, this means trouble.
- You know what to do?
- Sure, boss.
Step on it, Jackson.
What is this?
Irving.
Get me out of here.
- Located the gun yet?
- I can't answer that.
- Not at liberty to say?
- No. I don't know the answer.
Where do the guns come from?
I'm not at liberty to say.
Ask Captain Smolsky.
O'Dreary, break up the crowd.
- Have you found the gun?
- No comment.
- And the source of the guns?
- No comment.
Is it true that only one gang uses the gun?
No comment.
Can I give you a lift?
- You got a car?
- No.
How you gonna give me a lift? Stand me on a box?
- We could share a taxi.
- Forget it. I don't share fares.
I'm a lady.
Furthermore, I'm broke.
- Who said share fares?
- No?
No. I wouldn't dream of it.
- You wouldn't?
- I thought you'd pay.
Swell.
Let's walk.
It's a nice night.
You shouldn't walk at night. It's dangerous.
We'll be okay. We got your baseball bat.
Quit the "we" bit.
You mean, I'll be okay.
- Which way you going?
- Which way you going?
- This way.
- Then I'm going this way.
Let me take that.
No, it's all right.
Look, beat it, will you?
- What have you got in here?
- Just a few books.
Few books? You should start a library.
You should shut your mouth.
- Have you eaten?
- Ever since I was a kid.
- How come you're so skinny?
- Because I watch my weight.
I do that when I'm broke, too. How about eating now?
No.
- Why not?
- I'm not hungry.
- Not hungry?
- No.
I'm starving.
That's more like it.
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Take it easy.
Don't do that, Knuckles.
It's how I got my name.
Knock it off or change your name.
Tallulah, how long we got to wait?
Coming. You don't want me looking a mess, do you?
Snap it up, will you?
Put your flaps down, or you'll take off.
You spend more time prettying yourself than anyone.
If I didn't look this good, you wouldn't look at me.
I'll see you in the car.
What about my audition?
Tomorrow, Fizzy. I'm tired.
Lots of important business.
I have to go home.
I promise you, tomorrow.
Goodbye. Goodnight.
- You coming, Velma?
- Sure.
- Goodnight, Fizzy.
- Goodnight, Miss Tallulah.
Oh, my purse.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow never comes.
What kind of a fool do they take me for?
Tomorrow.
A resting place for bums...
a trap set in the slums, but I know the score.
I won't take no for an answer...
I was born to be a dancer...
tomorrow...
tomorrow, as they say...
another working day...
and another chore.
Tomorrow...
an awful...
place to be.
I gave up yesterday, but they still want more.
They'll compare me...
to Fred Astaire...
when I'm done.
Yeah.
Anyone who feels the rhythm moving through him...
knows it's gonna do him good to let the music burst out...
when you feel it, show it, let the people know it...
let your laughter loose till your scream becomes a a love shout...
tomorrow...
tomorrow's far away...
tomorrow, as they say...
is reserved for dreams.
Tomorrow...
tomorrow's looking grey...
a playground always locked trains no winning teams.
Won't take no for an answer...
I was born to be a dancer...
now.
Anyone who feels the rhythm moving through him...
knows it's gonna do him good...
to let the music...
burst out.
When you feel it, show it, let the people know it...
let your laughter loose...
till your scream becomes a love shout.
Going to the speakeasy tomorrow?
Depends. I'm trying my luck at the Bijoux Theatre.
Lena Marelli's show?
She walked out. They're changing everything.
How long have you wanted to be a singer?
I don't want to be just a singer, I wanna be a movie star... in Hollywood.
What's so funny?
I don't know.
Time was when people were happy being railway engineers... or nurses.
Don't you want to be anybody?
No. I'm happy being me.
What do you do?
Oh, this and that.
- Crooked, huh?
- No, in-between.
What do you do for money?
- I find boxers.
- You do?
I used to fight myself.
You did? How good were you?
- I could've been a contender.
- You could?
Sure, but for a few things.
- Like what?
- Like a glass jaw.
Jelly legs, no stamina.
- And most of all...
- What?
I got scared.
Some contender.
- Want another drink?
- No, I had enough.
Come on.
- Thought you didn't have money?
- I haven't.
- Then how you...?
- Relax.
I'll think of something.
Two more drinks.
Look, pal, the food counter's closed. the bar's closed.
My eyes are closing.
The whole joint’s closed.
I didn't want one, anyway.
Hello.
Operator, could you test this line? I believe we have a fault.
- What number, please?
- Columbus 19785.
- I'll call you right back.
- Thank you.
How much I owe you?
Eight banana boozle specials, with double ice cream.
Three beef spitfires... two cream donuts and a salami special.
Four dollars and 80 cents.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Let me out!
What are you doing? Let me out!
We interrupt commentary of tonight's ball game...
to bring you a bulletin on gang warfare.
Police now officially state...
that the new weapon of foreign manufacture...
known as the splurge gun is being widely used...
by mobster gangs.
We now go back to...
our reporter, Seymour Scoop.
What's more, it's just not cricket.
There's a Mr. Bronx
Charlie to see you.
I'll be right in. Show them into the conservatory.
Very good, sir.
Aren't you gonna play no more?
Later, my rose. Later.
Velia, oh Velia...
the witch of the wood...
would I not die for you if I could.
Velia, oh Velia...
- Next!
- Very nice.
Lovely. Next.
Get off the stage!
Don't give up your day job.
I didn't figure on this many people.
They all look like jugglers and magicians.
Don't worry. You got no competition. You'll walk it.
Hurry up.
Evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm proud to be here.
In fact, I'm lucky to be here.
Because as I was coming here...
- How do I look?
- Fine.
- I look terrible.
- Believe me, you look swell.
- Honest?
- Honest.
- Cross your heart?
- Cross my heart. Beautiful.
Next.
Once I built a railroad...
Not that old chestnut.
Get him off. Next.
Good evening.
Suppose you're wondering why we're here.
You bet.
Next.
Not one rabbit... not two rabbits... but three rabbits.
Next, next.
Next.
Yeah, great. Okay.
Next one there, please.
Give me your things.
Come on, come on.
Blousey Brown, singer.
Oh, nice face.
Great face, could do a lot with that.
Oscar.
Oscar.
Oscar.
I'm back. I'll give you one more chance.
Lena, you've come back to me.
I'll give you one more chance.
Otherwise, I'm out for good. Out, out, out!
I won't be humiliated.
I'm the star and I should be treated like one.
Hit it, Joe.
Show business, it's in my veins...
gotta keep singing that old refrain...
I thrill to all those tunes that make me wanna dance...
Cheer up. There's a million other jobs.
Sure, standing on the corner asking for dimes.
It's only a matter of time.
I've walked the streets for months, and the only fancy steps...
I've been doing is avoiding the rent collector.
Takes time to be a movie star.
We could come back tomorrow.
Come back tomorrow? I spend my whole life doing that.
Knock it off. Cool down.
I will not cool down.
Don't be stupid.
Will you be quiet up there?
I'm rehearsing.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
There's always Fat Sam's place.
- He won't see me.
- I'll talk to him.
- You know him?
- Know him? We're like that.
You're good friends?
No, but when I see him I cross my fingers that he won't hit me.
Come on, let's get out of here.
You're too good for this show.
- Why don't we try Fat Sam's?
- Yeah.
You gotta be kidding...
that show business is my business...
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, boss.
Relax, relax, will you?
I'd like to take the opportunity to thank you for your work.
Everything's gone so well.
Thanks, boss.
Thanks, boss.
Fat Sam must've had quite a shock.
- Quite a shock.
- Thanks, boss.
- Thanks, boss.
- Thanks.
Thanks, boss.
Laughing boy.
Yonkers. Shoulders.
Bronx Charlie. Benny Lee.
Any moment now Fat Sam will be... crawling on his knees to me.
On his knees.
- Where's my flower, boss?
- Yes... soon all Fat Sam will have is the suit he stands up in... and a suitcase full of memories.
I don't have a flower, boss.
What did I do?
You googed, Doodle.
You dropped the gun.
And I don't allow mistakes.
'Cause they put us in the caboose.
- And Sing Sing ain't my style.
- No, boss.
Not that. Anything but that.
I didn't mean to drop it.
It slipped outta my hands.
Button your lip.
You're all washed up.
- Give a guy a break.
- Get him!
Now listen to what I say, and listen good.
There's only room for one
Mr. Big in this town.
And that's me, Dandy Dan.
The time has come for us to play our next card.
Believe me, Fat Sam and his dumb bums... ain't gonna stand in our way.
We could've been anything...
that we wanted to be.
But don't it make your heart glad...
that we take pride in it...
we became the best at being bad.
We could've been anything we wanted to be...
with all the talent we had.
No doubt about it, we whine and we pout it...
we're the very best at being...
bad guys.
We're rotten to the core...
congratulations, no one likes you anymore...
bad guys...
we're the very worst.
Each of us contemptible...
we're criticized and cursed...
we've made the big-time...
malicious and mad...
we're the very best at being bad.
Look at me, I'm dancin'.
We could've been anything we wanted to be...
we took the easy way out...
with a little training, we've mastered complaining...
made us seem unnecessary...
we're so rude, it's scary...
We could've been anything we wanted to be...
with all the talent we had...
with a little practice
we made every black list...
we're the very best...
at being bad...
we're the very best...
at being bad.
Where you shovin' me?
We're the very best at being bad.
What are you doing?
Get in here, you bunch of peanut brains.
Get in here, you dummies.
We got business to do. Move it!
Come on, get in here.
We got business to do.
We can't waste all this time.
Right.
Let's get down to it.
Don't do that, Snake Eyes.
It's thinking time.
And don't do that, Knuckles.
Sure thing, boss.
Let's start at the beginning.
We're being outsmarted by that lounge lizard.
And we're gonna get back on top.
Back on top.
We'll kick that drugstore cowboy...
- into line.
- You bet, boss.
We've been a little slow off the mark, but dumb bums we ain't.
No, dumb bums we ain't.
Hand me a pie.
- Louie, over there in the corner.
- Me, boss?
Why me?
Louie, into the corner.
What did I do?
Nothing, Louie.
You see? Missed.
Okay, Lou. You can sit down.
Even a dumb bum like
Louie is too quick for us.
That's our trouble.
We're behind the times.
I don't get it.
We'll never get back on top with this kind of hardware.
It's old-fashioned.
In short, we gotta get that gun.
- Hello.
- Want some information?
- Start gabbin'...
- It's about the splurge gun.
It's at the Hung Fu
Shin laundry company.
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.
We've had a little break.
Who knows the Hung Fu
Shin laundry company?
My friend tells me that's where they stash the guns.
Get moving!
Not you, Knuckles.
Stay here with me.
Sure, boss.
Hello. What?
I don't believe it.
The whole gang?
Everybody?
That leaves you and me. We're on our own.
What we gonna do?
Don't do that! How many times I got to tell you?
Do nothing. Act like everything was normal.
- What does that mean?
- You can't speak Italian?
No, boss, I'm Jewish.
Then read the translation!
- Hey, Fizzy.
- Hey, Bugsy.
- Still practicing?
- Still practicing.
Suddenly everybody wants to be in show business.
Hi. Tallulah. I've come to see Fat Sam.
- Is he in?
- No, he's busy.
- Hi, Bugsy.
- Hi.
Have a drink while you wait.
Yeah, why not?
Go feed the ducks, will you?
Oh, Tallulah.
I said, beat it.
Long time no see.
- You know how it is.
- Yeah.
You used to come see me every night.
- I've been busy.
- Busy doing what?
This and that.
Fizzy, cut the ivory and hit the shoe leather.
Yes, ma'am.
You're aces, Bugsy.
I always found you special.
Careful, you're racing my mother.
Come on, give a girl a break.
Sure you've got the right fella?
- You're not like those other saps.
- No?
No.
You've got lovely brown eyes.
They'll be black eyes if Fat Sam catches us.
- How about smearing my lipstick?
- Careful.
If you come any closer,
I'll have to call my lawyer.
So call him.
Blousey.
Blousey.
Blousey.
It's the broad about the audition.
He's busy. Come back tomorrow.
No, no, no.
Hey, honey. I'm all ears.
Be with you in a minute.
Carry on as normal.
Don't let 'em know we're beat.
- Business as usual.
- Right.
- Calm and collected.
- Right.
So they don't know we're scared. I mean, concerned.
Sure, boss.
I'm feeling fine...
filled with emotions...
stronger than wine...
they give me the notion...
that this strange new feeling...
is something that you're feeling too.
Matter of fact...
I'm forced to admit it...
caught in the act...
and maybe we've hit it...
this strange new feeling...
is something you're feeling...
Okay, honey. That's enough.
A little contemporary for me, but very nice. You're hired.
That was great. That really was. Terrific.
Blousey.
Come back, will you?
What's the use?
I've got to go.
Blousey.
Where is she? Blousey.
Show's going swell.
Just the way I want it to be.
Same number of drinks, same everything.
They mustn't know they've got us on the run.
Here, I wanna show you something.
I've sent for someone to help us out of our predicament.
No ten-cent dummy. A specialist.
A doctor?
Not a doctor, a hoodlum.
I thought we were hoodlums.
Not a dumb bum. This guy is the real McCoy.
Not Looney Bergonzi!
The Looney Bergonzi?
The very same, mad as a hatter, Bergonzi.
Best man in Chicago.
Here's what we do.
We meet Dandy Dan.
Looney hides in the back seat.
- You drive.
- Right.
- But I don't drive.
- You what?
You don't drive?
Then we get ourselves a driver.
- Hi, Bugsy.
- Is Blousey there?
- She won't see you.
- Tell her I'm sick.
- You're sick?
- Sick of waiting.
Beat it.
Give a guy a break.
I brought you some flowers.
I'll see Tallulah gets them.
Quit being smart. They're for you.
Five minutes, girls.
- I have to go.
- I was thinking of getting a job.
You don't get paid for standing in bread lines.
A legit job. We could save enough money to go to Hollywood.
Believe it when I see it.
- Bugsy, you drive?
- Sure, why?
- Like to earn some green stuff?
- Long as it ain't cabbages.
Step inside. I got a proposition for you.
Flowers? For me?
How nice.
Put these in water.
Hello?
Who shall I say is calling? One moment.
- Hello.
- Dandy Dan, is that you?
- This is Dandy Dan speaking.
- I wanna arrange a meeting.
- Sure. Where?
- Outta town.
Agreed. Just you and a driver.
- When?
- Monday. 11 A.M..
Right, I'll be there.
Got him, the knuckle.
Got him, the salami.
Let's go and enjoy the show.
My name is Tallulah...
my first rule of thumb...
I don't say where I'm going, or where I'm coming from.
I try to leave a little reputation behind me...
so if you really need to, you'll know how to find me.
My name is Tallulah...
I live till I die...
I'll take what you give me...
and I won't ask why.
I've made a lot of friends in exotic places...
I don't remember names...
but I remember faces.
Lonely, you don't have to be lonely...
come see Tallulah, we can chase your troubles away.
If you're lonely...
you don't have to be lonely.
When they talk to Tallulah, you know what they say...
no one south of heaven's gonna treat you finer...
Tallulah had her training in North Carolina.
My name is Tallulah...
and soon I'll be gone...
an open invitation is the road I travel on.
I never say goodbye because the words upset me.
You may forgive my going...
but you won't forget me.
Lonely...
you don't have to be lonely...
come see Tallulah, we can chase your troubles away.
If you're lonely...
you don't have to be lonely...
when they talk about Tallulah, you know what they say...
no one south of heaven's gonna treat you finer...
Tallulah had her training in North Carolina.
They're coming.
Looney, keep your head down.
What can I do for you?
How about some straight talk?
Suits me.
- You've been taking liberties.
- I've been taking what's mine.
- Trouble is, it belongs to me.
- Too bad.
I'm sure we can talk it over. I'm a businessman.
Yeah, a dime-a-dozen gangster.
Button your lip.
Don't talk dirty to me.
I don't like your mouth. Have some respect.
You'd slit your own throat for two bits.
Keep your wisecracks.
Keep talking.
I have my position to think of.
Right now it's not worth a nickel.
You're a dirty rat, Dan.
You've been watching too many movies.
Okay, Looney, let him have it.
Charlie, Yonkers, it's a double-cross.
Okay, freeze.
Looney.
What's the matter with you?
Hey, you guys.
Over here!
Over here!
Come back, dummies!
They're getting away.
Come back here.
Come on, step on it.
Come on, let's go.
We're going to lose them.
Drive faster.
Dan, you're a rat!
You're a dirty rat!
Come on, they're gonna get us.
Hold tight, Mr. Stacetto.
Come on, Malone.
You're a dirty double-crossing rat!
Look out.
Don't stop!
There's a bridge!
Put the brakes on!
We lost them.
Go and cluck somewhere else.
Here. Get yourself a new suit.
Get rid of the sack you're wearing.
Thank you, Mr. Stacetto.
Here's my tailor's card.
You ain't got to pay for six months.
Thank you very much.
Think nothing of it. Let's go.
What do you think?
Don't I look cute?
I don't know.
Come on, Dotty, what do you think?
I think the color's wrong.
What are you talking about?
Purple's my color.
Don't I always wear purple?
It matches your nose.
Maybe it's the length.
It's the latest length. Look!
Maybe the frills stick out too much. Like your ears.
Frills are in. Look at this photo of Lena Marelli.
Lena Marelli is not Bangles Dobell.
You think it'd look better on you?
It'd look better on a horse.
Jealous. Can I help it if my looks are ahead of their time?
What?
Full of character.
Kind of earthy.
Like a bucket of mud.
You creep. Get lost!
How about you? Do you think I look terrible?
Do I look cute or terrible?
Honestly?
Bangles Dobell, you look terrible.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
Blousey.
Blousey.
Blousey.
It's for you. It's Bugsy.
Give him my love.
Thanks.
Hello.
Blousey, it's Bugsy.
Where are you?
Around. I can't talk, but I just made 200 bucks.
You printed it yourself?
No, I earned it.
Doing what?
Oh, this and that.
Hang on a minute.
I can't hear you.
There's a train going by.
Who gave you the money?
Fat Sam.
He gave you 200 dollars?
And the loan of his sedan for the afternoon.
He loaned you his sedan?
I don't believe it.
You're putting me on.
I believe you.
He's a sinner...
candy-coated...
he always seems to be alone...
but they love him,
Bugsy Malone.
A city slicker...
he can charm you with a smile...
a style all his own...
everybody loves that man...
Bugsy Malone.
Hard-headed Bugsy...
makes his mind up...
don't mess with Bugsy, or you'll wind up...
wishing you'd left him alone.
He's a man, a mountain, he's a rolling stone...
and when he leaves you...
sad and lonely...
cry, I couldn't say.
But it's known...
that everybody wants that man...
Bugsy Malone.
Mustard with onions or ketchup?
Mustard with onions.
Oh, and this, too.
- What's this?
- A present.
- Open it up.
- You got to be kidding.
I don't kid around.
It's beautiful.
Nice, huh?
What is it?
What is it? A viewer.
Look through here.
Pictures of Hollywood stars.
Bugsy... it's fantastic. It really is.
If only I could get to Hollywood.
You can.
Sure.
I know, in the front row... of the Roxy Theatre... on East 38th Street.
No, really get to Hollywood.
Keep talking.
1.80 for the viewer, right?
10 cents for the hot dogs.
Leaves 198 dollars for...
Surprise me.
- Two tickets.
- Two tickets?
How many tickets you need?
Two tickets to the ball game?
To Hollywood, dummy.
This can't be true.
Are we really going?
Knock it off.
You're putting me on.
It's the honest truth.
I'm picking them up tomorrow.
Now I better get
Fat Sam's car back.
Or I'm not going anywhere.
Is anyone in there?
Hello?
Are you hurt?
Help! Somebody help me, please!
Somebody, please!
Somebody help!
Help me, please!
They take your money?
Yeah. Nearly 200 dollars.
Thanks anyway for helping me.
It was nothing.
- You must be a boxer, right?
- No.
- You're not?
- No.
Best punching I ever saw.
- Ever been coached?
- No.
- Ever thought of taking it up?
- No.
Why not? You could be a champion.
- Never had the chance.
- I know who could help you.
- You know Cagey Joe?
- No.
- You must know Slugger's Gym?
- No.
- You don't know much, do you?
- Nope.
What's your name?
Smith, Leroy Smith.
I'm Bugsy Malone. Put it there.
You got yourself a manager.
- Know the first thing I'm gonna do?
- No.
Treat you to one heck of a meal.
- Thought they took all your dough.
- Who needs money?
Look at this, O'Dreary.
You cracked it this time, Captain.
Get the plaster.
We'll take a mold.
Come on, get the plaster.
Careful. Up a bit.
Left a bit.
Come on, hurry up.
Hold it straight. Be careful.
You idiots!
Hello. What?
They got the still.
The whole lot's gone.
Not the sarsaparilla racket, too. Get round here now.
- I can't, boss.
- Why not?
I'm all tied up.
I don't care if you're busy. Get here right away.
Careful, you idiots.
O'Dreary.
Don't worry... we'll break you out at headquarters.
- Hi, Bugsy. How you been?
- Swell, Cagey Joe.
I'd like you to meet the next heavyweight champion.
Leroy, meet Cagey Joe.
Cagey Joe, this is Leroy Smith.
- Ever been in the ring before?
- No.
- So you wanna be a fighter?
- No.
Sure he does. He's a natural.
Look at those fists.
Did you ever see such fists?
Hit it, Leroy.
You see? A born champion.
What's your name again?
Smith. Leroy Smith.
With your help... he could be champion in no time.
So you wanna be a boxer...
in the golden ring.
Can you punch like a train?
Tell me just one thing...
can you move like a hummingbird's wing?
Oh, that's fast!
Can you bob, can you weave?
Well, you might as well quit...
if you haven't got it.
So you wanna be a boxer, can you pass the test?
I can tell if you got it,
I've trained the best.
When you work and sweat like a buzz saw...
and you near lose your mind...
when you find out your boy has a glass jaw.
So you might as well quit...
if you haven't got it.
Put him in the ring, look at what you've found...
we can use the fun...
pushing him around.
We'll show him the ropes...
and destroy his hopes...
put him in the ring...
let him feel the sting...
we can make him dance...
we'll pound him to bits...
then he'll call it quits.
Come on, Leroy.
So you wanna be a boxer, wanna be the champ...
there's a golden boy inside you, not a punchy tramp...
if you listen and you learn, there's an honor you can earn...
when you see the crown, you're a king, not a clown.
But you might as well quit...
if you haven't got it.
Put him in the ring, something new to punch...
let me have a swing...
then we'll go to lunch...
then he'll get the drift.
Put him in the ring, chicken à la carte...
let me have a wing, tearing him apart.
The chicken will crow...
let me have him, Joe.
He's got it.
You sure this is going to work?
Sure. Looks like a splurge gun.
Doesn't it?
- Sort of.
- Nonsense.
Anything Dandy Dan can do, I can do better.
Are you ready?
Ready.
Don't do that!
Sorry, boss.
All right, take aim.
Ready.
Get set.
Fire.
Missed!
Back to the drawing board.
Knuckles!
Knuckles, speak to me.
Knuckles.
It's all your fault, hear me?
Hello?
Not the grocery racket, too?
Yeah.
That's the whole empire gone. Hear me? Everything.
They'll be coming here next.
There's only one thing for it.
You have to get him to help me.
Who? The Lone Ranger?
No, Bugsy Malone. Call him.
I'm in trouble, and all I got for company is a female comedienne.
I'm in trouble, bad trouble.
Is he there?
No. There's no answer.
Then get him to me poysanally.
Personally?
- Poysanally.
- Poysanally.
So long, lover boy.
I like men at my feet.
What you doing here?
I brought you a message.
What's wrong with Western Union?
Thought you'd like the company.
I'll buy you a drink.
Where?
How about Fat Sam's?
Won't he be there?
He sure will.
Maybe I'll stay home.
Don't flatter yourself... it's him that wants to see you.
Come on.
Before your suspenders strangle you.
Quit whistling, it makes me edgy.
Yes, boss.
- Pour me a double on the rocks.
- Sure, boss.
What's funny? You find me amusing?
I wasn't smiling at you.
Honest, I wasn't.
You find my suit funny?
No, boss.
It was your flower.
Yeah, it is kinda droopy.
Yeah, a little.
In fact, it's very droopy.
Very droopy, boss.
Hold it a minute.
It needs some water.
Don't ever laugh at me again... or I'll ram that smile down your throat.
I'm Fat Sam, don't forget that. Number one man, Mr. Big.
Always have been, always will be. Now get out.
Careful, the floor is wet.
Hi, honey.
Here he is.
Hey, Bugsy.
How you doing, Sam?
Glad to see you.
Pull up a chair.
Fix him a drink.
A special on the rocks.
What can I do for you?
Bugsy...
I'm in a jam.
Dandy Dan's gonna take over my organization.
You still got this.
If Dan gets his way,
I won't have a dime.
Can you leave us alone?
This is men's talk.
That's all right,
I'm unshockable.
Go fix your make-up.
I've already fixed it.
Then go make yourself look more beautiful.
You know that's impossible.
Anything's possible.
I'll go and manicure my gloves.
Bugsy, believe me... my gang's gone. My business is in ruins.
My friends don't wanna know me.
I'm a wreck.
In short, I need your help.
Why me?
'Cause you've got brains, not pretzels.
No, it's not my line.
400 dollars.
Do we have a deal?
Hello?
Bugsy, it's for you.
I think it's Blousey.
You got a deal.
Hold on, he won't be a second.
See you, Bugsy.
Hello, Blousey.
What are you doing there?
Just business.
With Tallulah?
No, with Fat Sam.
Did you get the tickets?
No, you see...
You promised me.
I know.
But Hollywood can wait, can't it?
You had no intention of taking me to Hollywood!
I do! But there's something
I've got to do first.
You promised me.
Trust me. I can't talk now. I'll call you.
Only a fool...
like fools before me...
I always think with my heart.
Only a fool...
that same old story...
seems I was born for the part.
It's a lesson that I've learned...
and a page I should have turned.
I shouldn't cry, but I do.
Like an ordinary fool...
when her ordinary dreams fall through.
How many times have I mistaken...
What can you see?
How many times have I mistaken...
love songs and laughs for the blues.
When a road I've walked before...
ends alone at my door...
I shouldn't cry, but I do...
when my ordinary dreams fall through.
- Splurge guns!
- Where?
In the crates. Look what it says on the truck.
I can't.
Can't you read?
Sure. But I'm short- sighted. What's it say?
It says: Splurge
Imports Incorporated.
Dock 17, East River.
- Must be where the guns are.
- Right.
Look out!
It's a lesson that I've learned...
and a page I should have turned...
I shouldn't cry but I do...
like an ordinary fool...
when her ordinary dreams fall through.
Blousey, miss your train?
What have I done?
Bugsy let you down?
The broad needs her head testing.
You better believe it.
Oh, yeah.
Can I have my job back?
Sure, the more the merrier. Go right in.
Hi, Blousey.
Hi, Blousey.
Ever see a broad carry a torch so high?
Yeah, the Statue of Liberty.
This must be the place.
Two guards on the door.
Two on the roof.
Two on the pier.
- What we gonna do?
- Go home?
There must be a way in.
Don't be stupid. We'll never get... past them.
You're right. Let's go.
What we gonna do, Leroy?
We need more men.
We need an army.
No armies around here.
Yeah, I know.
Hang on a minute.
Don't complain about the way your life has wound up...
think of all the time you waste, and time's a precious thing...
sure you've hit the bottom, but remember you're building up...
every day's another step that takes you closer to the sky...
so give it a try.
Don't be depressed about the way luck deceived you...
fortune sailed away, you missed the boat...
and found you'd been left behind.
What's the matter with you?
Fight and fight some more, till the world receives you...
Lady Luck is fickle, but a lady can change her mind.
Come on, guys, who's with me?
No!
What's the matter with you?
All right, here's somebody.
Me too.
What about the rest of you?
And you?
Why not?
Come on.
Don't sit around complaining...
about how your life's wound up...
be a man, you can't be certain you'll lose till you try.
Don't sit around complaining about how your life's wound up...
you can't be certain you'll lose...
till you try.
So give it a try.
- Is everybody with me?
- Yeah!
Come on.
There they are.
This is what we'll do.
Get Baby Face.
Get Baby Face.
Get Baby Face.
I'm Baby Face. What am I saying?
I gotta have courage.
Give this to Baby Face.
Big courage.
Give it to Baby Face.
Thanks. Just what I need.
Okay, you know what to do.
I'm scared.
Will you get out there!
Yeah, right, get out there.
I'm a big movie star now.
Geronimo!
Get that guy.
Dummies.
Come back here.
Come on, open the boxes.
My name is Tallulah, my first rule of thumb...
Stop fooling around.
Sorry, Bugsy.
I don't have to tell you how important this is.
This is gonna take the lid off City Hall.
- This is the big one.
- The big one.
The shake-down.
The shake-down.
The pay-off.
The pay off.
It's got to be good.
It's got to be good, it's got to be neat...
Quit repeating everything!
You shouldn't have any trouble.
Just Fat Sam and a few dance hall girls.
Good luck and off we go.
Three cheers for Dandy Dan.
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!
Too kind, guys.
Jelly, Jelly, open up!
They're here!
Just act normal.
Get to work.
Girls, off you go.
Razzmatazz, let's hear some music.
Okay, this is our moment.
Keep a cool head and keep those fingers pumping.
Remember, you'll be writing history.
Fat Sam ain't humble...
but it's your home sweet home...
plans are made here...
Okay, everybody, freeze.
Let them have it.
Amazing scenes... have been reported on the lower East side.
It's been a frightful bad show.
So, this is show business?
We could've been anything we wanted...
and it's not too late to change...
I'd be delighted...
to give it some thought...
maybe you'll agree that we really ought...
We could've been anything we wanted...
that decision is ours...
it's been decided, we're weaker divided...
let friendship double our powers.
We could've been anything we wanted...
and I'm not saying we should...
but if we tried it...
we could be the best...
at being good guys.
Flowers of the earth...
who can guess how much...
a real friend is worth.
Good guys...
shake an open hand...
maybe we'll be trusting...
if we try to understand.
No doubt about it...
it must be worthwhile...
friends tend to make you smile.
We could've been anything...
that we wanted to be.
That decision is ours.
It's been decided...
we're weaker divided...
let friendship double our powers.
You give a little love and it all comes back to you.
You know you'll be remembered for the things you say and do.
You give a little love and it all comes back to you.
You'll be remembered for the things you say and do.
You give a little love and it all comes back to you.
You'll be remembered for the things you say and do.
You give a little love...
and it all comes back to you.
John Dee.
Some pretty distractions, which you call angels... call forth to forget our cares.
Some aquavit to pass this hard night for our pleasure... and this our gentlewoman.
Your Majesty, as-- as once a virgin, fashioned the whole earth... so by a virgin it shall have rebirth.
So says the old sage, wisdom.
Dear Doctor John... our triumphant antimony... our kingdom's eyes.
This me pleaseth to see and have discourse with angels.
Your Majesty, the spell we cast forth... in the name of Christ Jesus and his angelic hosts... calling forth the fiery, spiritual creature... our angel Ariel.
Metrotron... angel commander of the ten hosts...
I cast for Ariel, pearl of fire... my only star.
God's moonbeam, send forth my flower.
The smoke and ashes of ages past... which hangs like morning mist in veils across the universe... parts in swirls and eddies...
and through them, the shooting star, my angel Ariel...
flies with mirrored eyes, leaving a sparkling phosphorescent trail... across the universe.
Down.
Down he plummets towards Earth... through the great vacuum... on the curve of infinity.
And like a fiery rose, he descends... to Mortlake.
All hail, great master.
Grave sir, hail.
I come to answer thy best pleasure... be it to fly, to swim... to dive into the fire, to ride upon the curled clouds... to thy strong bidding.
Ariel... and all his quality.
This vision exceedeth all expectation.
Such an abstract never before I spied.
An angel, Your Majesty, is the sun's true shadow.
Spirit Ariel...
Her Majesty wishes to have knowledge... to swim in those pure waters... which are the essence of that which bind all creation.
By me... this task shall be performed.
For I am that pure and clarified spirit... by which thou mayest turn all metals... to the most pure gold.
Sweet Majesty, pluck up thy heart... and be merry... for I will reveal to thee... the shadow of this time.
Break it up, kids. 
Get against the wall.
All right. Move.
Right up there. Come on.
Come on!
Quickly!
Run! Come on! Run!
All right, girls.
We are now proud to welcome...
Miss Amyl Nitrate...
England's glory... who's going to tell us the exciting story... of her misspent life.
The world is no longer interested in heroes.
So sad.
We now know too much about them, don't we?
Do you know any real heroes?
No. 
I don't.
Anyway, let me introduce you to... 
Amyl Nitrate.
She's our heroine.
Our school motto is 
Faites vos désirs réalité.
Make your desires reality.
I myself prefer the song,
"Don't Dream It, Be It."
"In those days, desires weren't allowed to become reality.
"So fantasy was substituted for them--
"films, books, pictures.
"They called it 'art.'
"But when your desires become reality... you don't need fantasy any longer, or art."
"I always remembered the school motto.
"As a child, my heroine was Myra Hindley.
"Do you remember her?
"Myra's crimes were, they said, beyond belief.
"That was because no one had any imagination then.
"They really didn't know how to make their desires reality.
"They were not artists like Myra.
"One can smile now at their naïveté.
"When, on my 15th birthday...
"law and order were finally abolished...
"all those statistics that were a substitute for reality...
"disappeared.
"The crime rate dropped to zero.
"Who believed in statistics then?
"Only the vital ones.
"In any case, I started to dance.
I wanted to defy... gravity?"
I haven't danced for a long time.
No one is interested in the ballet anymore.
But history still fascinates me.
It's so intangible.
You can weave facts anywhere you like.
Good guys can swap places with bad guys.
You might think Richard III of England was bad, but you'd be wrong.
What separates Hitler from Napoleon...
or even Alexander?
The size of the destruction, or is he nearer to us in time?
Was Churchill a hero?
Did he alter history for the better?
Now, my friend Mad, on the sofa, is a pyromaniac.
But she thinks she's a revolutionary out to better the world.
I'm not so sure.
The boys in the bed are Sphinx and Angel.
They're from Deptford and brothers.
Their relationship is quite peculiar...
but they're nice enough.
And over there at the wash basin is Chaos, our French au pair.
Life in England these days is inflationary...
but we're carrying on regardless...
coping with misgovernment and idiocy on every side.
Oh, Carnation from Floris.
Not all the good things have disappeared.
Shit! Piss!
- What's up, Amyl? 
- I've broken my Winston Churchill mug.
- Oh, look.
- Oh, Winston!
- Oh. 
- Oh, don't worry. We'll stick him together.
- Got a bit of glue. Don't worry.
- Oh, look.
- You got any glue? Got any glue?
- Yeah, yeah.
"Teach Yourself History, by Amyl Nitrate"
"Number one: 
'The History of England."'
"It all began with William the Conqueror...
"who screwed the Anglo-Saxons into the ground...
"carving the land into theirs and ours.
"They lived in mansions and ate beef at fat tables...
"whilst the poor lived in houses, minding the cows on a bowl of porridge--
"whilst they pushed them around with their arrogant foreign accents.
- There were two languages in the land--" 
- What two languages?
Chinese and Liverpudlian. 
How do I know?
- What about Norman? 
- Norman who?
Oh, fuck off.
"There were two languages in the land, and the seeds of war were sown.
"At first the two sides coexisted...
"meeting only on the racetrack and the battlefield... whilst they fought the rest of the world--"
That's you, Chaos-- 
"who they despised more than each other.
"Now one day, when there was no one left to fight...
"it dawned on them that the real enemy was at home...
and that they should fight themselves.
"Having grown greedy on the booty they had looted from the rest of the world...
"they decided to fight with money.
"But by now this was made with paper, so it was pretty worthless.
"So, when they discovered this... they took to fighting with guns."
"The rest of the world sighed a sigh of relief to be rid of them...
"and got on with their own business... and England slowly sank into the sea."
Who you writing this crap for, Amyl?
Myself.
It's a hobby.
When I'm not making history,
I write it.
I try to compress it.
It'd be great if all history could be written on a Mandrax.
This is how to compress it. 
You forget it!
What are you doing that for?
I'll compress you, you--
Whoo-hoo! 
Oh!
- Ow!
- Fuck off, Mad!
Help me, Sphinx. Amyl's a raving lunatic. 
I'm a damsel in distress.
You clammy slag.
You've sat in the K-Y with your fat arse!
Oh, fuck off!
You get it, Angel. 
The exercise will do you good.
I'm gonna show your brother the real thing.
- Fuck off.
- Oh, fuck off yourself.
Who is it?
It's Bod. 
Shut your eyes, all of you.
Shut your eyes, Angel.
Where'd you get it from?
I captured it in Deptford.
It's high fashion.
Now shall one king rise up against another...
and there shall be bloodshed throughout the whole world.
Fighting between the devil... his kingdom and the kingdom of light.
What'd you say your name was again?
Kid.
- You want some more eggs? 
- No, thank you.
- Want a cigarette? 
- No, thanks.
What do you do?
Nothing. I'm a musician.
You're gorgeous.
I could get you a job with Borgia Ginz.
He's always looking for new talent.
He owns the media.
My name is Crabs, by the way.
I'm an actress.
- Ever see War and Peace?
- No.
- Tea, please.
- Hi, Crabs.
Hello, Viv.
Where have you been all my life?
Now, now, Crabs. 
Don't worry.
She won't take him from you.
She's got me.
I like a girl with talent.
- So where's Amyl? 
- Burning the midnight oil.
Working on her decline and fall.
- Who's that?
- That's Bod.
She's royalty.
Don't like the way she looks. 
My dad had a suit like that.
Um, I think it's kind of nice.
She liberated it from a Russian diplomat...
she fucked at the Dorchester.
After he came, she put his clothes on in the dark.
She found a thousand pounds in the jacket.
Wears it for luck now.
You're a sucker for sex. 
Why don't you keep up with the times, Crabs!
You're an antique, like this place.
- What's the postcard, Mad? 
- It's New York.
And you can forget it.
It just had the bread to con the rest of the world.
America's dead; it's never been alive.
Montelimart.
It had better be.
Why don't you read the label, Bod?
All these ruins.
All this concrete, brick and glass... and the people who made them are utterly forgotten.
The prisons we live in today... might have taken more than a day to build... but it doesn't take long to destroy them.
You cow! 
Get out of my place!
- Oh, cor, cor.
- Oh, look at this!
Come on, Viv. 
Let's split.
Come on, Angel, before she burns the place down.
No one's gonna help you, so help yourselves.
No! Oh, no!
Disgusting.
No. No. Ah.
If your house is ugly, then burn it.
If the street you live in depresses you, then bulldoze 'em down.
And if the cook can't cook, then you kill her. All right?
Ah. 
For a moment, I thought you were gonna kill her.
Just dress rehearsal.
Oh, I was glad to get away. 
Mad's so crazy.
- Not to worry. 
- Well, I know she's right.
- That's what upsets me. 
- Bit bare in here, isn't it?
Well, she's got a bed, doesn't she?
- What you do in here all day? 
- I'm a painter.
An artist.
Very good.
Didn't know there was any artists anymore.
Yeah, there aren't. 
Painting's extinct.
Art isn't.
It's just a habit.
I started painting when I was eight... copying dinosaurs from a picture book.
It was prophetic.
- I'm alive. 
- So am I.
Artists steal the world's energy.
Bet they never get caught.
Always.
They become blood donors.
Their lifeblood drips away... until they're bled dry.
And the people who control the world...
make it as inaccessible as possible...
by driving the artists into corners.
You see, it's dangerous.
Our only hope is to recreate ourselves... as artists or anarchists, if you like... and release the energy for all.
My brother's an artist. 
A piss artist.
Love in a void it's so numb
Avoid in love it's so dumb
Love in a void
- Jaded reputation on which you're staking
- Rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds
Diamonds
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
- De da de da
- What a fucking awful day.
Da dum
Quite New Wave, don't you think?
Oh, give us a break.
I'm gonna make it into a crash helmet.
- That'd give it some use. 
- Mmm.
That would be distinctive. 
Why didn't you steal the pearls as well?
I never liked pearls.
- Or oysters. 
- Yeah.
Pearls are for the pure.
And the world's your oyster, so swallow it.
De dum dum da dum
De da dum de da da da
Diamonds
Diamonds
What's that?
- It's Top of the Pops. 
- What, again?
Yeah, they believe in overkill.
Mmm, he's cute. 
Who is it?
Waiting for our caviar.
Listen
- How should I know?
- I don't take trash to rot
Now come on, you morons.
We have the right to work
- What are we gonna do this evening? 
- We have the right to work
- We have the right to work
- Only thing that's open after 11:00... in this fucking country are the police cells.
Right on, Bod. If you're bored, join the National Front.
Mmm. Why don't you take up embroidery, doll?
There's so little electricity in this country.
Maybe it's fused!
Da da da da dum de da--
Ah, real help at last.
- We'll try the fox-trot
- Hello?
- I'll eat a mango 
- Who?
- You drink a straight scotch
- What?
Most people would hang up.
She's hanging on for dear life.
Oh, yes, I'd love to come.
- Who is it?
- God. Borgia Ginz.
The impresario.
He wants my opinion on his latest find.
- Are you going? 
- Of course.
Oh, how the mighty are... fallen.
She's got no principles.
I thought you were gonna introduce me to Borgia Ginz.
Ah. I don't give away my connections that easily.
You gotta convince me you're worth it first.
And she doesn't need much convincing, dear.
Anyway, I'm going.
Well... she's in for a surprise.
You wanna know my story, babe.
It's easy.
This is the generation who grew up... and forgot to lead their lives.
They were so busy... watching my endless movie.
It's power, babe. Power.
I don't create it.
I own it.
I sucked and sucked and I sucked.
The media became their only reality... and I own their world of flickering shadows.
BBC. TUC. ITV.
ABC. ATV.
MGM.
KGB.
C. of E.
You name it.
I bought them all... and rearranged the alphabet.
Without me... they don't exist.
My God!
It's Amyl Nitrate!
Sieg heil!
She's England's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest.
She's my number one.

To you, Elizabeth of England, is granted the greater vision... that man perceives but little and rarely.
Beyond this labyrinth... and the serpent of memory... is the still point of the world... that gateway which men seek.
It is everywhere and nowhere.
It is here and now.
Rounded time turns in a circle throughout infinity.
In you is the beginning and the end... and the forgetfulness beyond.
He who murders will swim in blood... lapping against the bounds of time.
But he who sings with joy... will be continuously greeted with joyfulness.
Every deed you accomplish accompanies you throughout time.
Consider the world's diversity... and worship it.
By denying it's multiplicity... you deny your own true nature.
Equality prevails not for the gods' sake... but for man's.
Men are weak... and cannot endure their manifold nature.
Yes.
He's great, isn't he? 
I picked him up at the roadblock.
- What's your name?
- Happy Days.
Where are you from?
World's end.
Why do you encourage them, Crabs?
You'll only get the clap.
Tough shit, you virgin queen.
Where were you last night?
Anyway, I like him. 
He's got a great arse.
Yeah, he's a real sex object.
A real cute sex object.
Uh! Back to work!
No tea breaks!
For Christ's sake, Crabs, leave off!
What do you see in these damn studs anyway?
Hey, you.
Why don't you push off!
- Oh, leave the guy alone. 
- Fuck off!
He's better than a vibrator and bigger.
You are. 
Don't worry about her.
Her parents were Christians. 
She was born with a hang-up.
Ah! 
- I'm coming! 
- Hang on!
Oh, another hit-and-run merchant!
Just hold it, mate, or it's curtains for you! 
Don't you spurt.
We'll pound you.
They all want to cream as quick as a flash of zipper.
It's a lower form of life.
Christ. Blue movies for breakfast is more than I can stomach.
Oh, I like to watch.
- Fuckin' hell. 
- Oh, neat.
Just right, man. 
Hold it.
You fucking bitch! 
Look at this!
Get off, you--
Oh, neat, neat, neat. 
Perfect. That's it.
Do you think he's dead?
Dial 9-9-9.
Right.
One, two, three.
- And-- 
- Wait. Hold on. Wait. Christ.
- Heave-- 
- Heave ho!
- Makes me rather sad. 
- Oh, cut it out, Crabs.
Mm. Just for a moment, 
I thought he was the one.
Go on. Laugh. 
I really did.
Shit, your mind's really blown, Crabs.
- Why are you all against me? 
- We're not.
We're just trying to save you... from yourself!
Yeah, your mind's like a faded collage... of Penthouse and true romance.
Just for a moment 
I fell in love with him.
Love snuffed it with the hippies.
Sex is for geriatrics.
The mindless.
O, my love is like
A red, red rose
That's newly sprung in June
O, my love
Is like a melody
That's sweetly played in tune
So fair art thou my bonnie lass
So deep in love am I
And
I will love thee still, my dear
Till all the seas gang dry
Well, Viv, it's your turn now.
We're steppin' back.
Us boys, we've been in the limelight now... five thousand years.
Great, isn't it?
He hands over to you just as time's running out.
- Oof.
- When there's no chance.
That's what I call friendship.
Well, I mean, the end's inevitable.
It's either now or later.
It's what makes the present so vital.
Take your partners for the last waltz.
I love you.
And I Iove you, Angel.
I love you both.
Both of you.
You seem to have got things sorted out.
Well, why look for anything else?
Life's too short.
All that desperate search for one place... that's better than the next.
And I will come again
My dear
Tho' it were
Ten thousand mile
My brother's great, isn't he?
- Ha!
- Perfect.
It's a nice day.
Let's go out.
Piss off.
It's the biggest studio in the world, Kid.
Borgia bought it from the liquidator.
Christ, it's huge!
Borgia does everything with style.
You didn't believe me, did you?
S-Sir... that was W-Wall Street.
They say the dollar's crashing since you withdrew your support.
I'm not interested... in peanuts economy, Schmeitzer.
Now, let's get down to the real business.
Committing a murder in the overcrowded cage
Well, sir, we've sold 50 million copies of "Paranoia Paradise"... in Moscow alone in the last three days.
Lounge Lizard's number one.
As long as the music's loud enough... we won't hear the world falling apart.
Black is black white is white
Life is life, baby nine to five
Oh, excuse me, sir.
There was a message earlier from M-Madame Mao.
She said she wanted to be in a film.
She won't be in this one.
I can assure you.
The alien way to every word you say
Is an inspiration to an uninspired day
Black is black white is white
E-Excuse me, Mr. Ginz... but it's Miss Crabs to see you.
Hi there, Borgia.
I hope I'm not interrupting, but, uh, this is strictly business.
I've been doing a little talent scouting for you.
He's called The Kid, but he's pure sex.
I'm gonna be his manager.
- Mmm. 
- Well.
What can I do for you?
Or rather... what can you do for me?
Hello, Mr. Gi-Ginz.
Oh! You see?
He's a natural!
He's gonna be the new Garbo!
Garbo is very p-profitable.
I'll take him into the theater... and audition him.
Just for you, Crabs.
I'll call Bod.
She'll be so jealous.
I don't care about the money.
- I just don't wanna get ripped off.
- Oh! Shh.
Please let me see the light of day
Turn it on an island in my you don't understand
They don't care
They don't see
There's a light in the nigh for people like me
Oh, you useless prat.
I know where there's some lovely flowers.
Really?
- Where?
- Max's.
It's a bit far, isn't it?
We can go by car.
Good old Max.
You'll love him.
- Hello, Max.
- Hi, Max.
This is Viv.
She's a friend.
- Hello, girl.
- Hi.
Okay. Come in.
We're round the back.
- Watch your foot, son.
- Praying for rain, eh?
- Hello, Bod.
- Hello.
- What a crazy garden, Max.
- Yeah.
I had a bad case of weeds, so I sprayed it all with poison.
It looked a bit sad then, so I planted all these plastic petunias.
Max has been telling me about his adventures as a mercenary, since he left the army.
Aw, the army was a fucking con.
It was a way of solving the unemployment problem... before they gave up entirely.
You're more likely to die of red tape in the Guards than a bullet.
I ran a sideline, sellin' the boys to the local punters in the pub.
The army sees more action in bed these days.
Ah, no.
Damn it.
This carnation's got mildew.
Yeah, we never got a chance to kill anyone in the army... so I used to kill the weeds in the garden of an evening instead.
- Yeah, it must have been frustrating in the army.
- You're not kiddin'.
Just think. We're sittin' on enough megatons to blast a sunrise into the west... and no one's prepared to press the fuckin' button.
It's a bleedin' waste. I mean, think what it all cost. I pay my taxes.
The're probably so bored...
- they haven't got the energy.
- Yeah.
War got so big... it lost all contact with people.
Yeah, well, the reaction's set in. 
It's moved back onto the streets.
Politicians helped, though.
They demoralized everyone so much talkin' about devalued money... as if it was all most of us cared about.
Their popularity died with the pound.
It's funny how, when you try for one thing, you end up with another.
Personally, though,
I prefer the world dead.
I mean, it's cleaner.
My idea of a perfect garden... is a remembrance poppy field.
There's a caterpillar.
There's a fucking caterpillar in the tulips.
Ew!
What the hell.
It's full of protein.
Hey, come down to the bingo parlor tonight.
You might win a prize..
- Right.
- Ta-ra!
- See you down there. Ta-ra! Ta-ra!
- Ta-ra!
Fuckin' kids.
Little ears will be much better
When you are a r-r-real go-getter
Gonna take you down all the way
Ooh ooh ooh
Plastic surgery
- It's so
- Plastic
Plastic surgery it's fantastic
You better take me away, yeah
Yeah
Oh, yeah
So don't go sitting in the sun
Your new face might start to run
Just forget your makeup scheme
Clean your face with Mr. Sheen
Ooh, I'm gonna
Take you down to Harley Street
Plastic surgery
It's so plastic
Oh, yeah 
Plastic surgery
- It's fantastic
- Fantastic
I'm gonna take you down 
I'm gonna take you down
Take you, take you down 
Oh, I'm gonna take you down
I'm gonna take you down to
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah 
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Ah, ooh, la-la-la
You're signed up!
Now... what are we going to call you?
S-S-Scum!
That's it! That's it.
Scum.
That's commercial.
It's all they deserve.
- You're great.
- Uh, plastic surgery.
Really, you're great.
Now take my advice.
Keep away from her.
She'd sell her soul for a couple of inches.
Look. 
The music industry's dead.
You're better off on the streets.
It's not worth it.
He'll steal your voice... and sell it.
He doesn't care if the mindless public hears your words or not.
He just wants to package you.
When he's through with you, you'll just be another face on another cover. Hey.
Why don't you come along and sing to me, huh?
And the devil came unto him... and took him to a very high place.
And he showed him all the boroughs of London.
And then the devil said...
"I'll give you all this... if you'll go down on your knees."
And he answered, knowing full well... it was built by the 
Department of the Environment... and was a rip-off...
"Fuck off, Satan."
And Satan left...
- and an angel came...
- Yeah? and ministered unto him.
Oh!
That's where Angel and I was born.
I never lived below the 14th floor... till I was old enough to run away.
Never saw the ground till I was four.
Just locked alone with the telly all day.
First time I saw flowers,
I freaked.
I was frightened of dandelions.
Me old gran picked one once.
I had hysterics.
Everything in that tower block was regulated.
Planned by the social planners... to the lowest common denominator.
Sight: concrete.
Sound: the telly.
Touch: plastic.
Taste: plastic.
Seasons regulated by thermostat.
Once a year, me mum and dad... dusted down the plastic Christmas tree... and exchanged pathetic presents.
Didn't know I was dead till I was 15.
Never experienced love or hate.
My generation's the blank generation.
Hmm, two.
Home and dry.
It's my lucky day.
And you threw a double.
Hmm. I've won a beauty contest.
Second prize.
- Oh.
- You'd only win second.
- First.
- Collect £10 from each player.
And quick.
I'll trade Whitehall for Piccadilly.
- Don't do it, Crabs.
- Oh, shut up.
I'll give you Piccadilly...
£200 cash-- ahhh-- a deal under the table...
- and... all of British Rail.
- Ah!
What's a nice girl like you doing trading Piccadilly?
You'd be lost without it.
I'm spaced.
Let's call a halt.
- Amyl will win in any case.
- Win what?
Anyone who can afford to build hotels on the Old Kent Road's bound to.
I'm gonna make some tea.
Anybody want any?
- Uh-uh.
- Mm-mmm.
Go get the black book, Amyl.
Let's plan the future.
Good-bye, baby, and amen!
Couples. 
What could be better than that?
Singles.
Must be something pretty in here somewhere.
There you are.
What about meeting him on a dark night?
Fuck. There's no one left.
They're all dead.
Success!
Who's that?
Lounge Lizard.
You think he's still alive?
Never heard of him.
Ew. He looks like death.
Kiss of death.
The world won't miss his missing... chromosome.
You're crazy, Bod.
I love you!
Let's go!
Come on, Chaos.
Let's get Lounge Lizard.
Go on, Crabs.
- Whoo!
- Let's go, Crabs!
Oh, I'm on TV again?
Oh, my big hit.
This earned me millions.
Late last night after I went to bed
I got a demonic feeling in my head
Yes, I did.
And you know--
Something pulled my legs apart
And I felt it right up to my heart
- Paranoia
- Paranoia
- Paradise
- Paradise
It's sure gonna be the death of me
- Ask Adam and Eve
- Ask Adam and Eve
Now, Eve didn't think that the devil was bad
No, the naughty boy.
But to her he was an angel that just turned bad
No, red. Red is the word. 
But what about communism?
Part of God's heaven is what the devil had
God.
God kicked the devil out
It doesn't matter.
I'm so rich. I'm filthy rich.
- I could eat my own glasses.
- Paranoia
Ooh, that was a no-no.
- Paradise
- Paradise
Is sure gonna be the death of me
- Ask Adam and Eve
- Ask Adam and Eve
- Paranoia
- Paranoia
- Paradise
- Paradise
Is sure gonna be the death of me
- Ask Adam and Eve
- Ask Adam and Eve
- Here we go. Another go. Paranoia paradise
- Paranoia paradise
- Paranoia paradise
- Paranoia paradise
- Paranoia paradise
- Paranoia paradise
- Paranoia paradise
- Paranoia paradise
Oh, yes. Uhh.
A star shines forever.
Stars never go out.
The galaxy is full of stars.
True stars.
Remember the days.
Good evening, backstage.
This is Miss Slaughter here... bringing you the very latest and important world events.
And tonight we have...
Lounge Lizard... who's granted us an exclusive interview... from the privacy of his own home!
First of all, Lounge... tell me what it's like... to be dead.
Boring!
I'm gonna vomit.
I bet you're loving it!
Oh, I love it.
Fucking great!
I am sorry.
However, we do allow you to take... seven records with you... of your own choice.
What a taste.
What a buzz.
Amyl, give us a Coke.
Give us a Coke, Amyl.
A great chill embraceth this place.
Your Majesty, by our leave.
'Tis a true marvel.
What signifieth this corpse?
A dark parable it is... to my understanding.
Light and dark, hot or cold... living... or dead... mankind is attracted by the polarities.
Seeing or not seeing.
Sweet angel... little I thought to be thus transported from my dear England.
Spirit Ariel... we would have knowledge of God.
Please Your Majesty.
Gaze deep into the crystal.
We...
Elizabeth of England... a feather in the wind of time... pray for knowledge of God... from the deep whirlwind of shadows...
on the edge of the abyss.
Where is God?
Is God dead?
Save your souls, ladies and gentlemen.
The greatest live show on Earth.
Save your soul. Welcome to the palace of heavenly delights.
And did those feet
In ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green
And was the Holy Lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen
And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills
And was Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Builded here
Among these dark satanic mills
And here's the man who made it all possible.
Cardinal Borgia Ginz.
The man who picked up the 30 pieces of silver...
and made the movie you saw on TV.
This is your last chance, folks.
So come on in.
Borgia Ginz is giving up the theater and going into the car park business.
Without progress... life would be unbearable.
Progress has taken the place of heaven.
It's like pornography:
Better than the real thing.
They prefer the shadows.
The light's too cruel for them.
They're all working for me... and they follow blindly... under life insurance.
Sent me
To give you
A little
Bit of sympathy
Ooh, I'm gonna
Hey, Mad, do you wanna hear my new chapter, "Civilization"?
What, are you gonna serialize it?
Hold it everybody. Another Mandrax history lesson from Amyl!
Oh, fuck off. 
Here goes any case.
"On human rights:
Human beings have no rights...
"but some dumb fuck's told them they have them.
"First political rights-- freedom of speech and things like that.
"And if that wasn't enough, they were told they had material rights too.
"They forgot about the political rights soon enough...
"but they got hooked on the material ones.
"One desolate suburban acre and a car...
"then a TV, fridge...
"and another car.
"That was by right, mind you, but the habit demanded more and more.
"The day came when the expectations couldn't be fulfilled any longer...
"and everyone felt cheated.
"So here we are in the present-- fucking great--
"with civilization destroyed by resentment.
"But since civilization itself was always fucking awfully boring for everyone...
"who gives a shit?
We can do without it."
Plastic surgery
It's fantastic
You better take me away
Yeah
- Oh, yeah
- Get the salt, Mad.
All right.
Hmm, it's a really neat job, isn't it?
A bit permanent.
- I can't find any salt.
- Oh, it's on the shelf.
- Is it behind the HP?
- Go and show her where it is, Viv.
- She's as blind as a bat. 
- They're all the same.
Oh, that live show was fucking awful.
- Where's that Borgia Ginz at?
- Nowhere.
- Yeah, where do they get those guys from?
- Oh, they dope them.
- Plastic surgery
- I saw them in the vestry.
- It showered Librium.
- Yeah, it was a real rip-off.
- It's for wankers.
- Yeah.
Oh, they're gonna take you down
Gonna take you down to oooh
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, ah, ah, ah
It's all fucking nostalgia.
It's the only way they can get through the day-- avoiding pure action.
It's the entertainment business, isn't it?
Easy come, easy go.
Yeah, well. I'm going bingo.
I promised Max.
I'm staying in.
I've got better things to do.
I'm gonna get zapped.
I really like TV when I'm stoned.
Yeah, well, I'm going bingo.
Come on, Kid.
Come on, Angel.
- You coming, Viv?
- No, I think I'll stay here.
Come on.
There's nothing here for you.
Come and have some fun.
- Okay.
- Whoo!
Come on. 
See ya!
Ta-ra.
Come on.
Hello, hello, hello. Welcome to Max's 
Bingo Palace. It's a laugh a minute.
Okay, now. 
Eyes down for the full house.
Lots of lovely prizes tonight.
First prize donated by General Idi Amin.
One of the privates got a chop last week.
We're not prejudiced here, you know. 
Second prize: tin of baked beans.
Offer definitely not to be repeated.
Okay. Let me get me balls untwisted and away we go.
And the first one's a white.
Five and six-- 56.

Four and nine-- 49.

She had the look.
You can tell, you know.
Oh, ain't it a shame?
Oh, don't be so sentimental, Joyce.
I know, but she was so young.
I know, but what did you expect?
She never carried a gun.
- Not even a knife.
- I know. She couldn't get used to it.
I told her last week in Sainsbury's,
"At least a hatpin, Maureen."
They threw the toaster in the bath, and she was electrocuted.
Oh, my God!
What do you expect with millions unemployed?
- Nothing. 
- Fuck all!
And it's white.
Five and five-- 55
And it's white.
'Ere, I won one of them inflatables last week for Fred.
Funny, three of us in the bed.
You ought to give it to Ted.
He'll be lonely without Maureen.
- Yeah.
- And it's white again.
Oh, my God! 
I've won! House!
The lovely lady in the white hat.
Three months' supply of jubilee knickers. 
Red, white and blue.
- What the 'ell do I do with them?
- Well, worth a quid.
Special Branch.
What the hell's going on?
- Special Branch. Nobody move.
- Come on. Give us a kiss.
You all right?
Yeah. I'm all right.
Yours.
This'll put an end to your history lessons.
- Hysterectomy touché. 
- Ow. Ooh, fuckin' hell.
Do you want any help, Amy!?
I got through life with brains... and a pair of fists.
Fists?
I just have to look.
- Okay. You're on.
- Come on then.
You rubber Medusa.
On my right we have...
Miss Amyl Nitrate.
And on my left...
Mad Medusa.
And may the best man win.
Oh, my fucking jaw!
Oh!
What are you doing in my chair?
The bingo--
They just--
They just killed the boys.
Like your charm, princess.
Yes, we are.
I need a piss.
Here you are, Viv. 
A toast for Angel.
And another one for Sphinx.
Come on. Don't cry.
Crying won't change anything. 
It's a negative reaction.
Help me make these firebombs instead.
It'll make you feel better.
We'll show those bastards.
You wait and see.
Fuck you, Mad!
Do you wanna kill us?
Britannia
Britannia rules the--
Oh, this'll put us in the mood.
Burn, burn, oblivion. R.I.P.
We'll get those bastards.
We'll corner 'em.
It's party time.
Let's liberate the zoo.
Where's the razor? 
Where's the razor?
I'm gonna castrate him!
Bastard!
I'll kill him!
Crawl! Crawl!
Crawl!
We'll kill you now!
Crawl!
Crawl!
Watch him crawl!
Crawl!
Bastard!
You fucking bastard!
Of course they've discovered the, uh-- the new chocolate substitute.
Sir, would you mind if put my stuff in with yours?
I haven't got much.
You know, I'd hate to waste a machine.
- Just make yourself at home.
- Thank you.
Hoopla.
Where'd you get the T-shirt?
Oh, T-shirt I pinched at, uh, Seditionaries.
Mmm.
So do you always take your clothes off in the launderette too?
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm. Très chic.
Must have cost a bomb.
Did you get it in the King's Road?
Mmm. So what are you doing after the spin dry?
Nothing.
I just love a man without his uniform.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm, sure is the special branch.
Let's get married.
Yeah. 
Could have kids.
Lots of boys like you.
I want to settle down.
I think I've fallen in love.
What do you do?
- I'm an actress.
- Mm-hmm.
In between jobs at the moment.
Did you ever see Rock Follies?
No.
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Shit. I'll get it.
No future!
Oh, li la. La, la.
The wheel turns.
In his hands... the roses of ecstasy burn.
The ashes are upon his brow.
Waters of Leith steal upon the golden-eyed.
He dances into silence.
Oh, li la. La, la.
Color deserts the world.
I am... the mirror-- the fire that consumes all that is created.
I bring the winter of thy flowers... and the frost that secretly destroys the temple.
Halt! Halt! Halt!
Blacks, homosexuals and Jews are banned in Dorset.
Section one. Passport.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Any seditious literature, records, tapes?
Hey, hold it.
That's my Elvis album.
That's on the blasphemous list too.
Right. On your way.
My God, the English Customs are deplorable.
It used to be just the color of your skin.
They have to be tough to keep the riffraff out.
Dorset's the only safe place to live now.
It's tragedy that socialism and freedom weren't compatible.
It's wonderful, Borgia.
Is it all yours?
It used to belong to some aristocratic family.
I requisitioned it.
Oh, well. 
Carnation from Floris.
Not all the good things have disappeared.
Sieg heil. Sieg heil.
Borgia, darling, can I have a tank?
It would be just perfect for a Saturday afternoon stroll down the King's Road.
Of course, darling.
You're my number one.
I'll make millions out of you.
This is my first trip to the country.
It's really exciting.
I mean, all those trees... and the animals!
I have a passion for fur.
They all sign up in the end, one way or another.
We lost Lounge Lizard... and gained the Daughters of God.
Crabs...
Amyl...
Maddie!
Oh, my heart rejoiceth... in the roar of the surf on the shingles.
Marvelous, sweet music it is to my ears.
Oh, what joy there is in the embrace of water and earth.
Yea, a great elixir is the seashore.
Here one can dream of--
of lands far distant and the-- the earth's treasure.
The sea remindeth me of youth.
Oh, John Dee, do you remember those days?
The whispered secrets at Oxford... like the sweet sea breeze?
Codes and counter-codes.
The secret language of flowers.
I assigned myself with rosemary... a true alexipharmic against your enemies.
And I with celandine... true gold of the new spring of learning.
You were my eyes then as now with your celestial geometry.
You laid a path through treachery... and opened my prison so that my heart flew like a swallow.
Sweet Majesty... to me you are the celandine now as then before... balm against all melancholy.
Hmm. Ah... but I was young then.
There and back.
There and back.
The waves break on the shores of England.
The white cliffs stand against the void.
We gaze seaward...
contemplating the night journey.
The sun sinks lower.
The moon waits to make her entrance.
In the south at Tilly Whim...
a picture of wind on the sea.
In the west...
a vision of silver dew falling into a chalice...
flowing on a sea of pure gold.
In the east...
a black hoarfrost--
the sun eclipsed by the wings of the phoenix.
In the north...
a howling chaos into which a black rain falls without ceasing.
Now... is the time of departure.
The last streamer that ties us to what is known... parts.
We drift into a sea of storms.
And now Elizabeth and Dee go along...
the same great highway...
and the light of the air about them seemed somewhat dark...
like evening or twilight.
And as they walked...
the phoenix spoke...
and cried with a loud voice:
"Come away."
Captain Walker didn't come home.
His unborn child will never know him
We believe him missing with a number of men,
Don't expect to see him again
It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy
It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy
A son! A son!
A son!
Hear the joyful celebrations in the street!
It's a boy born on this first day of peace!
We've won! A son! We've won!
I'm your friendly green coat,
And I welcome you to Bernie's Holiday Camp!
G'day, and you'll be happy,
And it's Bernie you will thank.
You must be little Tommy.
Well, call me Uncle Frank.
Welcome you too, Mrs. Walker,
Here you'll always find a helping hand!
The camp with the extras
If you come to Bernie's,
You might think you're in Heaven!
Here we have the winner, folks!
Have you ever seen a lovelier pair?
What a shapely ankle!
What a perfect shin!
If you could feel this silken thigh,
You'd know who has to win!
If you could feel this silken thigh,
You'd know.
You don't know how much I've missed
To feel a man again,
To dance, to kiss.
Your eyes reveal: You're lonely.
This evening must pass slowly.
Until we're one, my heart won't rest.
Will Tommy share our happiness?
I'll be more than an uncle;
I'll be just like a Dad!
I will be a green coat too,
And when I'm big, I'll own a Holiday Camp!
A camp with a difference,
Always be good weather.
When you come to Tommy's,
The holiday's forever!
I'm glad you like your Uncle Frank.
He'll surely love you too, just like a Dad
He's very nice, I think.
Did he fight in the War?
Gotta feeling '51 is gonna be a good year,
Especially if you and me see it out together.
So you think that '51 is gonna be a good year.
We'll marry now and see it out together.
I have no reason to be over-optimistic,
But somehow when you smile
I can brave bad weather.
What about the boy?
What about the boy?
What about the boy, he saw it all!
You didn't hear it, you didn't see it!
You won't say nothin' to no one,
Ever in your life. You never heard it.
How absurd it all seems, without any proof
You didn't hear it, you didn't see it!
You won't say nothin' to no one,
Ever in your life.
You never heard it.
How absurd it all seems, without any proof!
You won't say nothin' to no one,
Never tell a soul what you know is the truth!
Now he is deaf.
Now he is dumb
Now he is blind.
The guilty are safe,
But always accused by his empty eyes.
Nothing to say, Nothing to hear, And nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note in his symphony.
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey,
And learn all you should know.
A vague haze of delirium creeps up on him.
Soaring and flying images spin.
He is your leader, he is your guide.
On the amazing journey,
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.
Come on the amazing journey,
And learn all you should know
His eyes are the eyes that transmit all he knows,
The truth burns so bright it can melt winter snows.
A towering shadow, so black and so high,.
A white sun burning the earth and the sky.
Did you ever see the faces
Of the children, they get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning
Hours before the winter sun's ignited
They believe in dreams and all they mean,
Including Heaven's generosity.
Peeping 'round the door to see what
Parcels are for free in curiosity.
He doesn't know who Jesus was,
Or what praying is.
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.
Surrounded by his friends,
He sits so silently and
Unaware of anything.
Playing poxy pinball, picks his nose
He smiles, he cries,
He pokes his tongue at everything
I believe in love,
But how can men who've never seen light
Be enlightened?
Only if he's cured
Will his spirit's future level
Ever heighten.
And Tommy doesn't know what day it is.
He doesn't know who Jesus was,
Or what praying is.
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave?
You talk about your woman,
I wish you could see mine.
Everytime she starts to lovin',
She brings eyesight to the blind.
You know, her daddy gave her magic.
I can tell by the way she walks.
Everytime she starts to shake,
The dumb begin to talk,
She's got the power to heal you,
Never fear.
Just one word from her lips,
And the deaf can hear.
If your child ain't all he should be now,
This girl will put him right.
I'll show him what he could be now,
Just give me one night!
I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen,
Pay me before I start.
I'm the Gypsy, and I'm guaranteed
To mend his aching heart.
Give us a room, close the door.
Leave us for a while.
Your boy won't be a boy no more;
Young, but not a child!
'Cause I'm the Gypsy, the Acid Queen,
Pay me before I start.
The Gypsy, and I'm guaranteed
To tear your soul apart.
Gather your wits and hold on fast,
Your mind must learn to roam.
Just as the Gypsy Queen must do,
You're gonna hit the road!
My work is done, now look at him.
He's never been more alive.
His head it shakes, his fingers clutch.
Watch his body writhe!
Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Cousin Kevin?
There's something 'bout him I
Don't really like.
I think it's alright,
Yes, I think it's alright.
We're on our own, cousin.
All alone, cousin.
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away
You won't be much fun,
Being blind, deaf and dumb,
But I've no one to play with today.
Do you know how to play Hide and Seek?
To find me, it would take you a week!
You won't go anywhere.
There's a lot I can do to a freak!
How would you feel if I turned on the bath,
Ducked your head under and started to laugh?
Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm
Will change your expression to one of alarm.
I'm the school bully,
The classroom cheat,
The nastiest play-friend
You ever could meet.
I'll put glass in your dinner, and spikes in your seat.
I'll drag you around
By a lock of your hair,
And give you a push
At the top of the stair!
What would you do if I
Shut you outside
To stand in the rain and
Catch cold, so you'd die?
I'm the school bully,
The classroom cheat,
The nastiest play-friend
You ever could meet.
I'll stick pins in your fingers,
And tread on your feet.
We're on our own, cousin.
All alone, cousin.
We've thought of some nice games to play
While the grownups has all gone away.
You weren't too much fun,
'Cause you're blind, deaf and dumb,
But I'd no one to play with today.
Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Uncle Ernie?
Do you think it's alright?
He's had a few too many tonight
Yes, I think it's alright,
Yes, I think it's alright.
I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie;
I'm glad you won't see or hear me,
As I fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about.
Your mother left me here to mind you,
And I'm doing exactly what I bleedin' well want to,
Down with your bedclothes,
Up with your nightshirt.
Fiddle about, fiddle about, fiddle about.
You won't "shite"
As I fiddle "abite. "
Do you think it's alright
Leaving Tommy by the mirror?
You would think he had sight,
Been staring half the night.
Yes, I think it's alright,
Yes, I think it's alright
Extra, extra, pinball bonanza!
Deaf dumb and blind kid makes the big game!
Saturday, the final, he faces the champ!
Extra, extra, extra!
Pinball, the big time, a million in hand!
You can rule the world from a yacht in the bay!
Champagne flowing, you're popular, man!
Pinball, let's play!
Tommy keeps on winning,
He's a millionaire,
Momma's got a brand new Cadillac.
Hurry to the show,
We're nearly on the air!
Extra, extra!
Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From SoHo down to Brighton,
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothin' like him
In any amusement hall.
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.
He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feelin' all the bumpers,
Always playin' clean.
He plays by intuition.
The digit counters fall.
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.
He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist!
How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?
Well, he ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear no buzzers and bells.
Don't see lights a-flashing,
He plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
Never tilts at all,
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.
He can't beat me now,
I've always been the champ!
I know it's a trick!
No freak's gonna beat my hand!
He can beat my favorite table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I've never seen them fall.
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.
He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist!
He's a pinball wizard
His score shoots even more
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord!
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more thought I was the Bally table king,
But I just handed my pinball crown to him.
It rains champagne!
A son was born again!
A genius untamed!
A life of wealth and fame, wealth and fame!
Champagne flowing down just like rain,
Caviar breakfasts every day.
Merchant banks and yachts and...
Servants and cars and private sand.
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me.
They flock in, thousands strong.
We'll just play along.
A million in reserve.
For love, a just deserve, just deserve!
Birds and flowers and peacock's wings,
Sequined gowns and birds that sing!
Private planes and fishing lanes.
Bigger crowds and bigger, bigger, bigger takes.
But what's it all worth?
What's it all worth when my son is blind?
He can't hear the music nor enjoy what I'm buying.
His life is worthless, affecting mine.
I'd pay any price to drive his plight from my mind!
There's a man I've found
Could bring us all joy!
There's a doctor I've found can cure the boy!
A doctor I've found can cure the boy!
There's a man I've found could remove his sorrow,
He lives in this town, let's see him tomorrow,
He seems to be completely unreceptive.
The tests I gave him showed no sense at all.
His eyes react to light; the dials detect it.
He hears but cannot answer to your call.
There is no chance, no untried operation.
All hope lies with him and none with me.
Imagine though the shock from isolation,
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see.
His eyes can see,
His ears can hear, his lips speak.
All the time the needles flick and rock.
No machine can give the kind of stimulation,
Needed to remove his inner block.
I often wonder what it is he's feeling.
Has he ever heard a word I've said?
Look at him, now in the mirror dreaming.
What is happening in his head?
What is happening in his head?
Oooooh, I wish I knew, I wish I knew.
Tommy, can you see me?
Can I help to cheer you?
Tommy, can you hear me?
Can you feel me near you?
Oooh, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.
You don't answer my call
With even a nod or a twitch
But you gaze at your own reflection!
You don't seem to see me
But I think you can see yourself.
How can the mirror affect you?
Can you hear me
Or do I surmise
That you fear me can you feel my temper
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise,
Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror?
I'm free - I'm free,
And freedom tastes of reality!
I'm free - I'm free,
And I'm waiting for you to follow me.
If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high
You'd laugh and say "Nothing's that simple. "
But you've been told many times before
Messiahs pointed to the door
And no one had the guts to leave the temple!
I'm free - I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me.
Tommy, can you hear me?
Tommy, can you hear me?
Mother, Father.
Touch me, feel me.
Who am I, where did I come from?
Have you known me, have you seen me?
You're a hero! You are famous!
You're a champion of the young!
You are rich, but it's so absurd to try
To explain all the things you've done.
You're a god, and you're loved;
Thousands watch you play
Pinball! It's a fever!
And you're the master of the game!
And now that you're whole,
You'll be champion of their very souls.
Yes, I'm healed!
Delivered from silent darkness.
No more locked doors
Or stifled screams.
Pinball! What I see now before me
Is far beyond the game,
Beyond your wildest dreams!
Those who love me
Have a higher path to follow now
And you, dear mother, too
Must be prepared!
Extra, extra, read all about it!
Pinball Wizard in a miracle cure!
Extra, extra, read all about it!
Extra, Extra!
Right now, right now, story and pictures
Pinball bonanza, a mother's joy!
...to show times, lessons and actors.
Outside the house Mr. Simpson announced
That Sally couldn't go to the meeting.
He went on cleaning his black Rolls Royce
And she ran inside weeping.
She got to her room and tears splashed the picture
Of the new Messiah.
She picked up a book of her father's life
And threw it on the fire!
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part...
Is to be what you'll be. "
The theme of the sermon was come unto me,
Love will find a way,
So Sally decided to ignore her dad,
And sneak out anyway!
She spent all afternoon getting ready,
Decided she'd try to touch him,
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday.
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart,
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part...
Is to be what you'll be. "
She arrived at six and the place was swinging
To gospel music by nine.
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying.
She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row
And then one of the people came on stage
And shouted, "Here we go!"
The crowd went crazy as Tommy hit the stage!
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage!
Your happy welcome is like a favor
I must now return.
The darkness of my childhood past
And flames of blood now burn.
The pinball game I play so well
Reflects a way of life.
This meeting is just another game;
Let's play to win, tonight!
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, "Never mind, your part...
Is to be what you'll be. "
Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down,
Mingling with her tears.
Try to walk the path I walked,
Never mind the pain and fear.
Each one of you has freedom
In your heart without my grace.
Let me see you raise your hands
See joy upon your face!
The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage!
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch
And a gash across her face, her pretty face! Ooooh.
Sixteen stitches put her right and her Dad said,
"Don't say I didn't warn yer. "
Sally got married to a rock musician
She met in California.
Tommy always talks about the day
The disciples all went wild!
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile.
While Tommy flies, the world is turning.
Life goes on for you and me
Our chief concern is money earning,
Why can't someone set us free?
Can't you feel him?
Can't you feel him?
You'll feel me coming
A new vibration
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation.
I overwhelm as I approach you
Make your lungs hold breath inside!
Lovers break caresses for me
Love enhanced when I've gone by.
They worship me and all I touch
Hazy eyed they catch my glance,
Pleasant shudders shake their senses
My warm momentum throws their stance.
You'll feel me coming
A new vibration
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation.
Soon you'll see me can't you feel me
I'm coming...
Send your troubles dancing I know the answer
I'm coming...
I'm a sensation.
I leave a trail of rooted people
Mesmerised by just the sight,
The few I touched now are disciples
Love as One I Am the Light...
Come to my house,
Be one of the comfortable people.
Come to this house, We're drinking all night, Never sleeping.
Milkman come in!
And you, baker,
Little old lady, welcome,
And you, shoemaker.
Come to this house,
Into this house!
Come to this house,
Be one of us.
Make this your house,
Be one of us.
You can help
To collect some more in.
Young and old people,
Let's get them all in.
Ask along that man with a big red carnation
Bring every single person
From Victoria Station.
Go into that hospital,
And bring the nurses and patients.
Everybody go home and fetch their relations.
Come to this house,
Be one of the comfortable people.
Lovely bright home,
We're drinking all night never sleeping.
Hullo, Tommy, there's more at the door.
There's more at the door.
There's more at the door.
We need more room,
Build an extension.
A colorful palace,
Spare no expense, now!
Come to me now!
Come to me now!
To raise your weary spirits high,
My son will teach your silent hearts
To talk!
Every home will have his picture.
Pilgrims all will touch his hand.
Pinball tables, gold and silver,
Altars to the Master's plan!
Rio, Paris, New York, London.
Moscow, Peking, Tokyo, the world
A Tommy Camp in every city,
Millions flocking in like sheep.
What they want ain't cheap, 's a pity.
But who am I to upset their dreams?
These pricy gips don't teach us!
Your freedom doesn't reach us!
Enlightenment escapes us!
Awareness doesn't shape us!
How can all this trvia
Take us to the goal you reached?
We came here to be like you,
To find the world you've reached
These pricy gips don't teach us!
Your freedom doesn't reach us!
How can all this trvia
Take us to the goal you reached?
We came here to be like you,
To find the world you've reached!
Welcome to the camp!
I guess you all know why we're here.
My name is Tommy, and I became aware this year.
If you want to follow me,
You've got to play pinball.
So put in your earplugs,
Put on your eyeshades,
You know where to put the cork!
Hey you, gettin' drunk,
So sorry, I've got you sussed.
Hey, you, smokin' mother nature,
You missed the bus.
Hey, hung up old Mister Normal,
Don't try to gain my trust.
'Cos you ain't gonna follow me
Any of those ways,
Although you think you must!
Now you can't hear me,
Your ears are truly sealed!
You can't speak either,
'Cos your mouth is filled
You can't see nothing,
And pinball completes the scene.
Here come willing helpers
To guide you to
Your very own machine!
We're not gonna take it.
We're not gonna take it.
We're not gonna take it,
Never did and never will,
We don't have to take it.
Gonna break it!
Gonna shake it!
Let's forget it better still!
Don't want no religion,
As far as we can tell!
We ain't gonna take you,
Never did and never will!
We forsake you,
Gonna rape you,
Let's forget you better still!
Listening to you I get the music.
Gazing at you I get the heat.
Following you I climb the mountain.
I get excitement at your feet!
Right behind you I see the millions.
On you I see the glory.
From you I get opinions.
From you I get the story.
Listening to you I get the music.
Gazing at you I get the heat.
Following you I climb the mountain.
I get excitement at your feet!
Right behind you I see the millions.
On you I see the glory.
From you I get opinions.
From you I get the story.
Right behind you I see the millions.
On you I see the glory.
THE MAGIC FLUTE
OVERTURE
ACT I
Oh, help me, ye gods, will my prayers never reach you?
Deliver me now from this beast, I beseech you
Ye gods, show me mercy
It's drawing so near
So terribly near...
Oh, help me now
Oh help and protect me now
Die, vicious beast, die by the spear
Oh joy!
No wall his fear can disappear
He is released
Our valor saved him from the beast
This is indeed a youth most fair
Such beauty in a man is rare
Indeed, he has a graceful air
Could I by love enchanted be this youth alone could capture me
Now to the Queen.
We must not linger
This joyful message we must bring her
Would that this youth a way could find to give her back her peace of mind
So hasten now, you two.
I'll guard him hereforyou
No,you go. I must say it's better that I stay
What is this all about?
I'll do the watching out
I'll guard him here fo ryou
- It's better that I stay
- I'll do the watching out
- I'll guard him
- I'm staying
I'll watch him
Is that so?
I am to go?
Oh no!
Oh no - ah, that is so?
I am to go?
She would thus be rid of us
Oh no!
Oh no, I shall not go
To have him formy very own now if we were only left alone now if they would leave him here with me
But no -alas.
It shall not be
And if that's so I'd better go
I'll go, I'll go
Adonis, keeper of my heart
Now fare thee well forwe must part
Farewell,we'll meet again
Farewell
We two will meet a new
A fowler gay in me you see
There are not many more like me
I am a well-known person here belov'd wherever I appear
I play my pipe and at the sound all kinds of birds do flock around
By catching birds I earned my fame and Papageno is my name
Of course I'm happy in my trade but I get lonesome for a maid
Alone I wander all day long and only birds can hear my song
No girls come flocking
'round my feet although my melody is sweet
I want a maiden of my own to have and keep for me alone
Now you frightened him. I catch birds for the Queen of the Night
So this is her territory?
Have you ever seen her?
You must be mad. She wouldn't show herself to just anybody
-Whatareyou staring at?
-Ofcourse
You saved mefrom the dragon
Dragon, indeed
Well,the main thing is someone killed it
- But how? You're unarmed
- I've gota strong fist
Papageno!
Now in today.
Only water...
And no cake.
Butyou may have a stone
No sweet figs either. But pray, accept this padlock for your lips
Prince Tamino, be still
Our Queen sends you this locket with her daughter's picture
If you are not indifferent to her features then bliss, honor, and fame await you
The beauty of this wondrous face divine in all its tenderg race a feeling is aroused in me
A hope of bliss and ecstasy
I can'tcomprehend this wistfuly earning
Butmy bewildered heart is burning
Can it be love, this mystery?
It is
I know that itmust be
I know it, I know it
What else but love could it be?
Where does she dwell, my heart's desire?
How might I best her love inspire?
If only now my dream came true
What is mydream?
Thatshewere here so I could face her
And with a lover's gentle arms embrace her
Then she would beforevermine then she would be forever mine
-The path to fortune lies open
-Our Queen has heard every word
She has read your heart
At last, she feels certain her daughter can be rescued
Pamina was abducted bya mighty sorcerer
She lay asleep under the cypresses one day when Sarastro crept up to her
Yes, he is a devilishly cunning man with many different guises
And he lured Pamina away
I shall rescue her,
I swear by my love
Listen,Tamino - Do you hear a distant thunder?
- Nightfalls over the mountain
- Our Queen is coming
No need tofear, mydearestfriend
Your heart is gentle daring pure
And you alone have the strength and power to aid a mother in her darkest hour
Life holds for me but grief and sorrow since my dear child was lured away
Now gray and cloudy dawns each morrow
A want on deed destroyed my peace of yesterday
The memory still daunts me
Forever it haunts me
Her vain protestation her sad lamentation
I heard her crying in the distance
Oh, help!
In vain she had to plead
I could not come to her assistance
I failed her in her hour of need
My power failed me in her hour of need
You must go through hell and through high water
Perilous land you must explore
Yes, perilous land you must explore
But if you bring me back my daughter then she is yours forever more
Then she is yours... forever more
Do I sleep or do I wake?
Is this a dream or reality?
Your punishment was prompt indeed but I think they were too hard on you
It's hardly pity that you need but alas, there's nothing I can do
Our Queen, so merciful and wise now pardons you fortelling lies
- Hey listen - Papageno'stalking
- Now do beware of telling lies
- I'll never tell another lie
-The padlock is your reason why the padlock is my reason why
Oh that the lips of every liar could thus be sealed and locked forgood
Instead of malice, hate, and ire we would have love and brotherhood
My Prince, accept this giftfrom me, a present from Her Majesty
A magic flute she now has sent you foryour protection on this venture
Just play, and you may take for granted your listeners will be enchanted
The sad will feel the joy of life
The bachelor will seek a wife
Such a magicflute is a treasure of tremendous worth
For by its sound man is inspired to live in peace with all on earth
It is time for me to go now
- Ladies. Now good bye to you.
- Notsofast
We'll let you know now what our Queen wants you to do
With the Prince, go on your way now to Sarastro. No delay now
No, indeed, I must decline.
That's not really in my line
To Sarastro...Thank you, no.
If our venture should miscarry he would have me plucked and roasted and then feed me to the crow
Why feel alarm? -The Prince will keep you safe from harm
Oh that the Prince would goto blazes - My life is dear to me
I do not trust their pretty phrases.
They are no guarantee
-A small advance is onlyfair
-Well, well, what is in there?
These little bells that sweetly tingle
And could I also make them jingle?
But of course - yes, certainly!
Flute of magic, bells of vision keep us safe upon our mission
Now good luck, you fearless men
Now farewell, we'll meet again
But we don't know the way.
Pray tells. where does this vile Sarastro dwell?
We are three spirits to attend you
Our help and counsel we will lend you
Just keep in mind that you'd bewise always to do as we advise
They are three spirits to attend us
Their help and counsel they will lend us
Just keep in mind that you'd be wise always to do as we advise
It's time that we went on our way
Farewell, we'll meet another day
We'll meet again
We'll meet again
- Now, Pamina. Caught at last
-Oh, my heart, don't beat so fast
- Don't think you'll ever leave
- It's not for myself I grieve
But my poor mother'll die, I fear from losing one she held so dear
Pamina, you will be locked in so that you can't escape us
I'd rather have you kill me
Barbarian!
Now strike me down
Away, away!
Now let us be alone
This puzzles me - whose house is this?
But look- there is Pamina.
This is too good to miss
Good evening, my dear girl
Say, what is going on here?
This surely isthefiend himself
Yes,this must bethefiend himself
- Have mercy!
- Me? Mercy?
- Please spare me now!
- I? Spare you now?
Go
-Who are you?
-The Queen ofthe Night sent me
- My mother...What's your name?
- Papageno. But let me check first
"Beautiful eyes"...yes
Though a little red
"Fair hair"... it is fair
"Red lips"...your lips are red
Everything's right
Except the feet. ccording to this picture, you don't have feet
Where did you get that?
A long story. I'm keeping it for the Prince
-What Prince?
- I'm notsure
But here is his picture
Your mother took to him at once and asked him to free you from Sarastro
I've come before him
Tamino is in love with you
Tamino, in love with me?
Then why is he not here?
We've been looking separately.
A bird showed metheway
What time is it? Sarastro will be home any minute now. Come
-Sarastro? Was he the cad?
- No. His servant, Monostatos
- If you knew
- I can imagine. He looked a real -
So he is.
Come, we must hurry
How do I know you're no tone of Sarastro's evil spirits?
Me? Why, I'm the best spirit in the world
-You do look good-hearted
-That's for sure. But hurry now
Anyway, what do I want with a heart?
When I think that Papageno still has no Papagena...
Not even a girlfriend to share my merry moments with
-You'll soon find a sweetheart
- I'll tell you one thing, though
A man by gentle love inspired will have a heart that's kind and good to listen to his heart's desires
How sweet the lot of womanhood
For love will warm us day and night
Love is the source of true delight
Love brings relief in pain and sorrow
It soothes a soul in misery
Love holds the key to each tomorrow
In it is born Eternity
For love's sweet sake the world began
Woman and man, thus love began
Love is pure and love is bright
Lovers are each other's light
Heaven doth them both unite
This path will lead you to your goal
If you pay heed to this expedient
Here are the rules: don't lose control
Be stead fast silent and obedient
But listen, tell me first, you three
When will Pamina be set free?
We must not tell, no use to plead
Be stead fast, silenta nd obedient
Obey the rules and you will succeed if you make use of this expedient
I strongly feel it would bewise for me to do as they advise
Where am I now?
Which path is right?
And could this be a godly site?
The gates and the columns, their towering beauty would point to a reign of art, wisdom and duty
Where art is protected and beauty may dwell the people are happy, the master rules well
Alone I shall venture to open the door
My purpose is noble, my motives are pure
Sarastro, mark these words, you scum
To save Pamina
I have come
Stand back
Stand back?
I'll try another door
Stand back
The same words as before
One single entrance is left
Now shall I be dismissed once more?
Bold stranger, pray,what do you want?
What brings you to this sanctuary?
I seek the mistress of my heart
A worthy cause, it would appear
And yet you will not be admitted
It isn't love that brings you here
To evil powers you have submitted
Revenge on the barbarian!
In our company you won't find him
Sarastro, is he not your leader?
Oh yes, Sarastro rules these parts
But surely not the Temple here?
Oh yes, he rules the Temple here
Then all must be hypocrisy
So you would leave us now?
I want to leave. -Yes, begone, gone from deceit and fraud
What do you mean byt hat?
Will you explain yourself?.
Sarastro rules here.
That is enough forme
If life is dear to you, then speak now. Tell me all
-Sarastro you abhor?
- I loathe his very name
- He is a great and holyman
- He is a tyrantand a brute
You sufferfrom a misconception
The victim of his vile deception told me Sarastro stole her child
That woman would have you beguiled
Her venom poisons every word
And you believe what you have heard?
If Sarastro now were here then he could make his purpose clear
Well, it's obvious to me
Am I erroneously instructed?
Pamina, was she not abducted?
That's correct, yes I agree
Where is she?
Still alive and well?
Or is she dead?
What have they done?
Be patient yet a while, my son
I am instructed not to tell
Explain this puzzle.
Tell me now
I'm still obliged to keep my vow
But when am I to know the answer?
As soon as it is understood that you shall join our brotherhood
Oh endless night you never lighten
When will the darkness ever brighten?
Soon or never evermore...
Soon or never, did they notsay?
You hidden spirits, answer me if yet Pamina lives
Pa -mi - na is alive
Yet alive?
I thank you forthatword
Oh that my voice injubilation could sing your praise and exaltation,
Almighty Ones, I'd thus impart the feeling of relief in my heart
What power in your gentlev oice sweet flute ofmagic
For you rtones so soft and tender a heaven here on earth engender
What power in your gentle sound
Your voice isfull of magic splendor
For your tones so soft engender on earth a blissful heaven...
But-my Pamina my Pamina does not hear
My Pamina is not here
Pamina!
Pamina!
Hear me, hear me now
In vain...
Where?
Where? Pray tell, where can you be?
Ah,that is Papageno's flute
Perhaps she's coming here with him
Yes, she has heard my melody
She heard my flute
My darling will be free
The flute will bring her here to me
Fearless hearta nd nimble feet make for a discreet retreat
Oh, Tamino, hurry now, or they'll get us any how
Oh Tamino, hurry, hurry now
Or they'll get us, get us, get us any how
Come, Tamino
Wait a minute, maybe we should take a chance here
Oh what joy to hear him answer.
He has heard us, he is near
And his flute is pure and clear
Could this be the end of worry?
Better hurry better hurry
Ha! Seems like you both are caught!
Bring me manacles and fetters - you have lost out to your betters
Now I'll teach you to deceive me.
You will smart forth is, believe me
Hurry upw ith chains and rope
-Shall we really give up hope?
- Hurry up with chains and rope
Faint hearts never won a single thing
Little bells, let's hear you ring.
We must really take a chance
Let us risk a song and dance
How sweet is their tinkle, how tenderand gay
If only forever the music would play
Sweetly chiming bells, your worth is beyond all measure
Would that every man on earth owned so dear a treasure
Then to your harmonious sound love would flourish all around
It would mean the end of strife, fear and violations
Man would lead a peaceful life
Love would heal the nations
We praise thee, Sarastro.
Long live our master
What now will befall us?
What awful disaster?
My friend, this is the end, I fear
We soon shall have Sarastro here
Oh, if I were a mouse
I'd find a hole to hide in
Or if a snail, I'd glide into my little house
Oh dear
What ever shall we say?
Be honest and truthful
Honest, come wha tmay
Long life to Sarastro.
We praise his decisions
We hail our master, his heavenly visions
He wisely decides and we gladly obey he is our prophet, he shows us the way
Sir...
I confess, I disobeyed, escaped, because I was afraid
The blame,though, should not rest with me
The wicked Moor sought to abuse me and that is why I tried to flee
Arise, you have no need to fea rme
I do not ask for a confession a reason why you would depart
I know the secret of your heart yes,the secret of your heart
You acted under love's impression and yet I cannot set you free
You acted under love's impression and... and yet I cannot set you free
My mother grieves for losing me
Oh, my poor mother
She is within my power
Your life is wasted from the hour that you are left to her devices
She is my mother, that suffices
I love her
She is proud and weak
It is a manyou need to guide you
Advice from me you now must seek
With counsel fair I can provide you
My proud youngster, come this way, our lord Sarastroto obey
-'Tis he
-'Tis she
Yes, it is he
Oh, can it be
My arms must reach out to you and if I die for what I do...
-This is peculiar
- Have you no shame at all?
This is indecent, let go at once!
See your servant kneel before you
Formy reward I now implore you to punish the audacious lad
You must know the plans he had?
To snatch her was his foul intention until I made my intervention
- I beg you, hear me now, o Lord
-Yes,you deserve a just reward
- Fo rthis good man I will allow
-Accep my gratitude, o Lord
Forty lashes now
Oh no
Spare me your thanks,
'tis but my task
Long life to Sarastro.
We praise his decisions
We hail ourmaster his heavenly visions
Now for probation lead these two into the Temple to be tried
And let their eyes beveiled from sight until their hearts are purified
Where virtue and benevolence are given such preeminence this heavenly affinity yes, heavenly affinity does grantto man divinity
ACT Il
Friends and brothers
I solemnly declare this assembly to be of the utmost importance
Tamino is waiting bythe north gate
He intensely desires to find a goal and purpose in life and aspires to become a member of our brotherhood
- Is he virtuous?
- He is
- Is he fearless?
- He is
Is he reticent?
You deem him worthy, do you not?
Yes
For Tamino, I have destined mydaughter Pamina
Therefore I took her away from her mother,the arrogant creature
She would have our
Temple reduced to ashes and destroy the holy writ o fwisdom!
Her ultimate purpose is to control the world.
Pamina and Tamino shall protect our holy principles
You want them to rule together over our alliance and our kingdom?
In true love you shall find the origin of wisdom
That is why I shall resign my power to Pamina and Tamino if they show themselves worthy and endure their appointed trials
Brothers, doyou approve of my decision?
Yes
Ye gods oflight for your assistance to this young pair we now appeal
Lend them your wisdom and persistence
Thus guidet hem through their harsh ordeal
For their pains richly requite them
Often I think this sad old world is whistling in the dark
Just like a child who, late from school walks bravely home through the park
To keep their spirits soaring and keep the night at bay
Neither quite knowing which way they are going they sing the shadows away
Often I think my poor old heart has given up for good
And then I see a brand new face
I glimpse some new neighbourhood
So walk me back home my darling tell me dreams really come true
Whistling whistling here in the dark with you
So walk me back home my darling tell me dreams really come true
Whistling whistling here in the dark with you
Play Pack Up Your Troubles.
Don't go. Don't worry.
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And smile, smile, smile
While you've a lucifer to light your fag
Smile, boys, that's the style
What's the use of worrying?
Get back to your seats.
It never was worthwhile
So pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And smile
Come on.
Smile, smile
Again!
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And smile, smile, smile
While you've a lucifer to light your fag
Smile, boys, that's the style
What's the use of worrying?
It never was worthwhile
So
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And smile, smile, smile
Keep the Home Fires Burning.
Keep the home fires burning
While your hearts are yearning
Though your lads are far away
They dream of home
There's a silver lining
Through the dark cloud shining
Turn the dark cloud inside out
Till the boys
Tipperary!
Come home
It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know
Goodbye, Piccadilly
Farewell, Leicester Square
It's a long, long way to Tipperary
But my heart's right there
Bravo!
- Good evening, Miss Lili.
- Hello, Emma.
- The Colonel's in the study.
- Thank you.
- Emma, I'd love some tea.
- Yes, miss.
Kurt.
How nice.
- How are you, my dear?
- Fine.
That's most important, Lili.
We must know exactly how the Allies are planning to utilise the military aircraft.
The war is changing.
It is moving into the air, and, Lili, we cannot afford to minimise this new potential.
As each new squadron is formed, the air war expands, the ground war is altered, forced to shift, and to, how would you say,
- to accommodate on a day-to-day basis.
- It's hard to believe.
What, that those ridiculous little aircrafts could make such a difference?
Yesterday Baron von Richthofen led six of those ridiculous little aircraft...
Thank you. In an attack on the ammunition depot in Toulon.
The explosion shattered windows in Paris.
It also stopped a well-planned enemy attack in the Argonne sector.
Incidentally, I understand you're to be decorated by the French government.
Yes.
When?
- No date's been set, but soon, I expect.
- The sooner the better.
- Good evening, Mr Bedford.
- Good evening, Sergeant.
Sorry to disturb you at this late hour, but we've reason to believe
- there's a German spy in the vicinity.
- Blimey.
You haven't seen or heard anything suspicious, have you?
Not a thing, but I'll certainly let you know if I do.
Is Miss Lili down for the weekend?
Yes, her uncle's staying with us.
I believe you met Mr von Ruger when he was here last summer.
Yes, the distinguished
Swedish gentleman.
- Swiss.
- Yes, that's right, Swiss.
Give Miss Lili my regards, and her uncle, and keep your eyes open, Mr Bedford.
- I certainly will. Good night, Sergeant.
- Good night.
Trouble?
Nothing we can't handle.
We just have to be careful.
Your assignment is the famous Major William Larrabee.
Of the five men having access to the day-to-day planning of the air war, he would seem to be the best prospect.
He's young, attractive, unmarried.
That's a change.
I'm getting weary of diplomats and old generals.
The Major is considered to be quite the ladies' man.
If you're gonna spend any length of time in France you should arrange some concerts, maybe visit some of the hospitals.
Yes.
Success.
Major Larrabee.
Look out!
What's he doing?
Good morning, Colonel.
General.
You know Kraus?
Yes.
I understand you've assigned
Project Sparrow to Lili Smith.
Lili Schmidt.
But that, my dear Colonel, is precisely the distinction that separates our points of view.
You say Schmidt, I say Smith.
Her father was German.
Her mother is English.
Lili Smith is an English subject.
She left Germany when she was 10.
Forgive me, General, but I am not going to debate this issue with you again.
Her record speaks for itself.
My dear Colonel, I'm almost as impressed with her record as you are.
Impressed, not convinced.
That is unfortunate, General, because until I am relieved of my command, or you obtain the necessary authority to countermand my orders,
I will continue to assign to Lili Schmidt whatever project seems to me appropriate.
You forget yourself, Colonel.
I am still your superior officer, and I will stop you if I have to go to the Kaiser to do it.
I'll be happy to make an appointment for you.
I'm having lunch with him this afternoon.
Von Ruger, that woman is a security risk.
She's an emotional female who, in my opinion, involved herself for all the wrong reasons and because of your personal relationship, you refuse to admit the potential danger!
Concerning my personal relationship with the lady, General, it is, first, none of your business and second, it in no way influences her capabilities as an agent.
Regardless of what you may think, she is the perfect spy, and the ideal person to succeed with Project Sparrow.
And now, if you'll forgive me,
I'll be late for lunch.
Kraus.
They tell a story back in London town
That when you hear taps sound
Then all you soldiers have a sweetheart
Who always comes around
When night is falling
She comes calling
The girl in no man's land
She comes to cheer them
And be near them
The dream they understand
Doughboys weary, cold, and lonely
Know her as their one and only
The angel who at close of day
Comes 'round to kiss their cares away
When this is over
You'll discover
The love you've always planned
Until that time pretend that I'm
The girl in no man's land
Doughboys weary, cold, and lonely
Know her as their one and only
The angel who at close of day
Comes 'round to kiss their cares away
When this is over
You'll discover
The love you've always planned
Until that time pretend that I'm
The girl in no man's land
Very good.
Very good, my dear.
Damn good show, old girl.
Damn good show.
Just seat me there.
Alors, jouons Rainy Day, d'accord?
Smile away each rainy day
And laugh away your blues
Be like old Mr Noah
When it starts to pour
Make fun of trouble
Although you're seein' double
Keep in mind they're silver-lined
Those gloomy clouds of grey
Let love light the sky up
Tell the clouds to dry up
And smile away each rainy day
Here he comes.
I have to dine with two generals this evening.
The unofficial headquarters of Major Larrabee's squadron is the Cafe Cancan.
Excuse me, ma'am, General.
'Cause I'm a little drunk, but there's something I just got to say.
- Ma'am, you are an inspiration.
- Thank you.
I heard you sing in London, and you sang
It's a long way to Tipperary
And, ma'am, it was inspirational!
What was that?
I just told the General you heard me sing It's a Long Way to Tipperary.
Oh, yeah, you should've heard her,
General. You, too, General.
It was purely, purely inspirational.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.
What was that?
He says you're one of the famous Eagle Squadron.
He says you're one of the famous Eagle Squadron.
Yes, ma'am.
Lieutenant George
"Youngblood" Carson.
How do you do?
My grandmother was a full-blooded Cherokee Indian.
- How exciting.
- It was for my granddaddy.
Listen, if it wouldn't be putting you to too much trouble,
I've got some buddies over there just dying to meet you.
Hey, fellows!
- What's happening?
- Come here.
Don't get up, General, it's just my squadron.
- Meet Miss Lili Smith.
- How do you do, miss? I'm...
Come on, Long Way to Tipperary.
You know it. Let's hear it.
Yeah, jolly good, that's it. Yeah, that's it.
Hey, everyone. Come on, everyone.
Pick it up.
Sing it. Sing it for me. Let's hear it.
Yes, sing it for me.
Now, sing it for me. Sing it.
Hello. I should sing and dance it.
That's it. Oh, yeah. Singing it.
Everybody give it to me.
It's a long way to Tipperary
Thank you.
It's a long way to go
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know
Goodbye, Piccadilly
Farewell, Leicester Square
There it is.
It's a long, long way to Tipperary
But my heart's right there
Hey, come on.

So, in the interest of saving time, and as the senior Cherokee Indian,

Allô?
- Hello, uncle.
- Hello, my dear.
How was the evening?
- You should know, you were there.
- You don't miss anything, do you?
One of Major Larrabee's men said he was on some kind of important mission.
That's too bad.
I've no doubt you'll meet the Major another time.
I hope so. In the meantime, should we get together?
How about a late breakfast, say around noon?
- I look forward to seeing you.
- Bye, darling.
Bye, uncle.
- Any instructions?
- No.
Thank you.
- I'm Bill Larrabee.
- How do you do?
I have champagne, caviar, marinated truffles, brilliant foie gras, and half a dozen assorted Hungarian Gypsies.
Sounds delicious.
- I thought we'd go on a picnic.
- At 3:00 in the morning?
It's the best time. No ants.
- That's my squadron, dawn patrol.
- Is it?
- When do you have to report back?
- Friday.
When do you have to go back to England?
Soon.
Not too soon, I hope.
- It depends.
- On what?
I'm beginning to think, Major, it might just possibly depend on you.
What's he like?
Attractive, charming, conceited.
- And when do you see him again?
- Tonight.
- And when do you see him again?
- Tonight.
He's on leave until Friday.
You better get some sleep.
I think you're right.
No, relax.
Stay and finish your breakfast.
I'll contact you the minute
I have something important.
- Pleasant dreams.
- Thank you, darling.
- A picnic at 3:00 in the morning.
- Best time. No ants.
It's 11:00, Miss Lili.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night?
I fly at dawn.
Good night, darling.
"I fly at dawn"?
- Quote, unquote.
- Amazing.
Yes, makes a girl feel a bit insecure.
You? Insecure?
Not really, but, you must admit, it is a bit unnatural.
Yes, considering the provocation, but that's really beside the point.
It is?
The information you've extracted from Major Larrabee has greatly exceeded our expectations, and should the need for more persuasive measures arise,
I'm sure that you'll be up to it.
Yes, but will Major Larrabee?
The gentlemen are from French army intelligence.
Are they?
Mademoiselle Smith, what a pleasure to meet you.
Good morning.
- Please forgive us this intrusion.
- No intrusion at all.
This is my colleague,
Lieutenant Liggett.
Very...
And I am Captain Duvalle.
We are with army intelligence.
Won't you sit down?
Now, how can I help you?
You are a friend of Major William F. Larrabee.
Yes.
We have reason to believe that Major Larrabee is passing military secrets to the enemy.
You can't be serious.
There is no question that vital data is leaking out concerning allied air operations.
And, mind, there are very few men having access to this information.
The foremost is Major Larrabee.
We strongly suspect that he is passing the information to a German secret agent.
But this is preposterous, even to suggest that Major Larrabee's a traitor.
I hope I'm wrong and that is why we are here.
We need your cooperation.
What sort of cooperation?
Watch, listen, report anything suspicious.
- You're asking me to be an informer.
- I'm asking you to help establish
Major Larrabee's guilt or innocence.
Mademoiselle Smith, we must discover who this German agent is and apprehend her.
It is a matter of national sécurité.
It is a matter of self-respect.
When you have some proof of your allegations, then I might, perhaps, reconsider.
- Her?
- Pardon?
- You said apprehend her.
- I...
It's our opinion that Major Larrabee is giving information to a woman.
Of course, it's only an opinion.
It seems reasonable to assume that a man like the Major...
I mean, with his record...
Military record.
If he is passing information to the enemy, he is doing so unwillingly.
I mean, unknowingly. He's being coerced.
He's being seduced.
Yes.
As I've said before, when you have some proof, then I might consider helping you, but until such time,
I'm afraid it's out of the question.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Naturally, of course, we can count on your discretion in this matter.
- Naturally.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- You heard?
- Yes.
If I continue with Major Larrabee, it could be just a matter of time before they discover that I'm the one they want.
On the other hand, if I stop seeing the Major and the flow of information stops at the same time, they'll know immediately.
Interesting situation.
If you're good at riddle solving
If you make the claim
That no puzzle ever puzzles you
Here is one that needs evolving
Here's a guessing game
That should be a snap for you to do
I'll give you three guesses
Who loves you
Who's loved you
Right from the start
Not your mother
Who likes to baby you so
And not the girl back home
You used to know, oh, no
There's somebody special
Who needs you
Together or apart
Bet you don't need three guesses
And not even two
To know that I'm the one
Sweetheart
There's somebody special
Who needs you
Together or apart
Bet you don't need three guesses
And not even two
To know that I'm the one
Sweetheart
Miss Smith!
Miss Smith, your curtain call.
Would it be indiscreet to say that I missed you?
No.
- To say that I missed you terribly?
- Not quite.
Desperately?
- Possibly.
- Passionately?
- Definitely.
- Would you settle for desperately?
I'll settle for passionately.
- What about my reputation?
- I'll risk it.
You look tired, darling.
- I am, a little bit.
- Was it that bad?
No, not that bad, but bad.
- The Baron plays pretty rough.
- The Baron?
Von Richthofen.
He fights very well, that gentleman.
- When do you have to be back?
- Sunday.
- Not till Sunday night.
- Then you can get plenty of rest.
I thought, if you have nothing to do, we could ride out to the country tomorrow.
I know a lovely little spot.
Quiet, romantic, guaranteed to restore the body and renovate the soul.
Or is it the other way around?
- Either way, it sounds marvellous.
- Marvellous it is.
And tonight we eat, we drink,
- we forget the Baron.
- It really was bad, wasn't it?
It was hell.
Army intelligence.
We would like a table for two.
And as near as possible, if you please, to Major Larrabee's table.
I don't understand.
I'm aware that we have no reservations, but this is official government business.
Allez. Allez.
I am sorry, but I am not the head waiter.
- Go find the head waiter.
- Oui.
My apologies, monsieur.
Thank you.
- Are they really that good?
- Yes, they're delicious. Will you try one?
- No.
- Come on, try one.
- Some other time.
- My foot!
Your drink, my foot.
Now, go on, there we are.
Sit down, old sport.
There you are, you can sit down there.
Good girl. And I'll sit down...
Excuse me, could we borrow this chair?
Yes, of course.
I have to put my leg up.
You see, I've got a plaster and...
Good God.
I thought you were in hospital.
My goodness me.
They let you out, too, did they?
- How are you? Any better?
- I'm fine, thank you.
Yes, well, so am I.
I mean, with this thing here, and I'm over there with...
I don't know what her name is.
- Anyway, who are you with?
- Major Larrabee.
Major Larrabee?
I know him very well.
We fly together everywhere.
- Really?
- Yes, we do.
- Hello, old cock.
- Hello.
- We've just been talking about you.
- Were you?
Yes. Nice to see you up and about again, even though you are sitting down.
Anyway, bye-bye, now.
Very nice, dear. Off we go.
And I'll see you...
Incidentally, old cock, how did you fare this weekend with Operation Crepe Suzette?
Incidentally, old cock, that mission was top-secret.
Oh. Yes, yes.
What?
Just a minute.
Get that thing down, you fool.
Back with that.
Get these men off me!
And it happens that he's drunk, always is.
- Even when he flies?
- Always is.
I don't believe it.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- But then why does he drink?
- Because he's afraid to fly.
- Then why does he fly?
- Because he likes to drink.
Well, sooner or later, he's bound to get himself killed.
Sooner or later, he probably will.
Meanwhile, he has seven planes to his credit.
- What? You're not serious.
- I certainly am.
You mean he shot down seven German planes?
- No, he shot down seven French planes.
- What?
Actually, he only shot down one.
The rest he just wrecked.
And when you consider he's only been at the front for about six months, it's an incredible record.
- And you're an incredible liar.
- My word of honour.
As of last Friday,
Lieutenant Twombly-Crouch was tied with von Richthofen for the championship.
- I still don't believe you.
- Neither does anybody else.
That's what keeps old T.C. Flying, or crashing, as the case may be.
Nobody believes it, including his squadron commander.
- And who's that?
- Me.
What was all that talk about top-secret missions and Crepe Suzette?
Just talk.
You know,
I think you're some kind of a spy.
If I told you I was?
- I know lots of military secrets.
- Good.
Back in a minute to pry them out of you.
Crepe Suzette.
What?
That's exactly what he said.
Operation Crepe Suzette.
- What else?
- That it's top-secret. So far, that's all.
But he's planned a weekend in the country and I'll contact you as soon as I have the information.
Bill?
Major Larrabee?
Look!
Bonjour.
Au revoir.
To us.
- Bill, do me a favour?
- Sure.
No lines, no campaign.
In the first place, it isn't necessary and in the second place,
I want whatever happens this weekend to be honest.
Since I have nothing to gain by lying to you,
I think you're the most provocative, exciting, and most desirable woman
I've ever met.
I'll buy that.
Excuse me.
I have champagne.
Here. Compliments of the management.
- Will you be ordering dinner?
- No.
I'm sorry, darling.
Bill, would you excuse me just one minute?
Be right back.
Shan't be long.
- Are you out of your mind?
- He lied to you.
- What?
- He didn't fly last weekend.
There was no encounter with von Richthofen.
Larrabee's squadron was in the air, but Larrabee was not.
Moreover, we've checked every channel and nothing at all has filtered down about any operation Crepe Suzette.
So, either it is even more important than we imagined, or it simply doesn't exist.
- And if it doesn't?
- Then he's onto you.
It's possible, I suppose, but my every instinct says no.
Then what's the alternative?
Another woman?
It's our opinion that Major Larrabee is giving information to a woman.
I fly at dawn. Good night, darling.
How did you fare with Operation Crepe Suzette?
He's being coerced.
He's being seduced.
Yes, I am a little tired.
Operation Crepe Suzette.
Suzette. Suzette.
Lili?
Lili?
- Anything wrong?
- No.
- Any more champagne?
- Plenty.
What?
- Darling, I'm sorry.- No, it's okay.
- It was an accident.- No, it's okay.
- I've ruined your shirt.
- Doesn't matter.
Shouldn't you change?
What's the difference?
It's coming off in a minute anyway.
Certainly
What's wrong?
I was just going to ask you.
- Ask me what?
- What's wrong?
- With me?
- Yeah.
Well nothing, darling, but I do sense something about you.
- Me?
- It's really not important.
Of course it's important.
The girl that went into that bedroom is not the same girl who just walked out.
- Rubbish.
- It's not rubbish.
We're having our first fight.
We are not fighting.
I'm simply trying to point out...
Bill.
- Carry me.
- What?
My room.
.....My room.
Wait a minute. I have a better idea.
I'm sorry, darling. Really, I am.
I just can't help it.
- Are you all right?
- What do you mean "all right"?
Come now, you've got to admit seduction can really be very funny if you stop to think about it.
But you're not supposed to stop to think about it.
Oh, Bill, that's a terribly naive point of view for a man of your sophistication and experience.
- Bill?
- Look,
- couldn't we talk about this tomorrow?
- Oh, my love.
- Damn it, Lili.
- Sorry. I really can't help it.
If you really wanted me, it shouldn't matter anyway.
Come here.
My sweet.
My love.
What is it?
- What did you just call me?
- What?
- What did you just call me?
- When?
Think.
- What in the...
- Think! What did you just call me?
What do you mean?
How do I know what I called you?
You called me darling, you called me your love, and you called me something else.
I said you were wonderful.
You called me something else, a name.
A name?
- Suzette.
- What?
- You called me Suzette.
- The hell I did.
- The hell you didn't. You did.
- The hell I did.
- Why would I call you Suzette?
- I don't know.
- Do you know a Suzette?
- No!
- You don't?
- No.
- Bill...
- Yeah?
I'm sorry.
I am.
- My pet.
- What?
"My pet. " That's what I called you.
- "My pet"?
- You're damn right.
My pet, sounds like Suzette.
Suzette, my pet. My pet, Suzette.
- That's what I called you.
- Oh.
- Now what's wrong?
- Nothing.
Don't tell me nothing.
- Did you really call me "my pet"?
- Yes.
I really called you "my pet. "
- What's the matter with that?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
Okay.
Oh, shoot.
Oh, Bill. Oh, darling.
Oh, sweet, forgive me.
I've been behaving like an idiot schoolgirl and I'm sorry.
I adore you.
There have been others?
- Oh, my darling.
- Many?
- Bill.
- What?
- You're not being honest.
- What do you mean, not being honest?
- What about Suzette?
- Damn it to hell, Lili,
- I told you, there is no Suzette.
- Operation Crepe Suzette.
- That's not a woman.
- Then what is it?
For God's sake, Lili, you heard T.C. The other night.
Operation Crepe Suzette is a military secret.
That's what you said.
And that's what it is.
It's so important, I can't even tell you.
It isn't that I don't trust you.
It's just a matter of national security.
I wouldn't even tell my own mother.
All right.
You want to know about Operation Crepe Suzette?
I'll tell you about Operation Crepe Suzette.
I'd rather you didn't.
You're gonna hear about it anyway.
- I don't want you to break...
- The hell with security!
I want to get this straight once and for all.
You want honesty, you're going to get honesty, and I could get shot for it.
I'm gonna give you every little detail of the biggest military operation since Battle of the Marne.
Last weekend, after I left you,
I reported to intelligence for a top-secret briefing and it was big.
I mean, really big. Everybody was there.
D'Esperey, Hirschauer, Joffre, all of them.
And the English brass, too.
Rawlinson, even Haig.
The Germans were building a secret weapon so big, so devastating, that it might have ended the war tomorrow.
Every available squadron was ordered into the air, and I was to lead the attack.
The plan was to mass over Starnberg.
He lied to you.
He didn't fly last weekend.
There was no encounter with von Richthofen.
It was the most concentrated bombing effort of the war to this day.
And the code name for the whole operation was
Crepe Suzette.
- And you led the attack?
- Yes.
Lili. Lili.
What the hell did I do, Lili?
This is ridiculous.
At least tell me what I did wrong.
Lili!
Lili.
- Where are you going?
- I fly at dawn.
Lili!
Lili!
- Lili, now, stop it!
- I am going back to Paris.
You were going to take my car and leave me here?
Damn right!
- Choke it.
- I'd be delighted.
Swine! Egomaniac!
Lili!
Open this door!
I'm warning you, Lili, if you don't open this door,
I'm gonna break it down.
Lili!
- Where is she?
- I think she is in her room, sir.
Damn it, woman, we're going to settle this once and for all.
- Get out of here!
- Not until we settle this.
- There's nothing to settle.
- The hell there isn't!
- Go settle it with Suzette.
- Suzette, my foot.
Suzette, my crepe.
Get out of my shower!
- What are you doing?
- Now, let's have it.
You bastard!
- You going to tell me?
- Yes.
- Generals Haig and...
- Rawlinson?
What about Generals Haig and Rawlinson?
They were having dinner with me the night they were supposed to be briefing you.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
So I'm a liar.
What would you rather I be, a traitor?
- What?
- You heard me, I said traitor.
The lives of hundreds, thousands of men depend upon Operation Crepe Suzette being kept a secret.
What in the name of hellish vanity makes you think
I'd compromise that in the name of your adolescent, narcissistic ego?
- My ego?
- Sure, I lied to you. I had to.
You know what?
I think you're glad you caught me lying.
- Rubbish.
- It is?
I think maybe you have to come up with excuses
- just to avoid the moment of truth.
- What?
In a word, Miss Smith,
I think it's just possible you're a virgin.
- Bill?
- Yeah?
Turn on the warm water.
Get off! Boches!
Gentlemen.
Mademoiselle Smith.
Do sit down.
We have come to speak to you again about Major Larrabee.
Yes?
Since last we met, certain new evidence has come to light.
And now we believe we know the identity of the person to whom Major Larrabee has been passing information.
She's a well-known entertainer.
Really?
Her name is Suzette Maldue.
- Who?
- Perhaps you've heard of her.
She's known as Crepe Suzette.
Your Good-Will Ambassador
Would like to know
Are you doing okay
Your Good-Will Ambassador
Would like to feel
You're enjoying your stay
If you're calm and placid or if you've a red hot desire to roam
I want to get you all to know Paree
For there's a fast Paree
And there's a slow Paree
We'll do the whole big, sexy potpourri
'Cause baby
I'm going to make you at home
We'll do the whole big, sexy potpourri
'Cause baby
I'm going to make you at home
Or on the Left Bank
I'm going to make you at home
Or on the Right Bank
I'm going to make you at home
That filthy, scheming, cheating, faking, lying, egotistic, self-indulgent, hedonistic, son of a...
Think we can do it?
Yes, but you had better fly,
'cause I haven't been drinking.
Halt!
Wait for me!
Wait a minute!
Just a minute. Where are you going?
I'll give you three guesses
Who loves you
Who's loved you
Right from the start
Not your mother
Who likes to baby you so
And not the girl back home
You used to know
Oh, no
There's somebody special
Who needs you
Together or apart
Bet you don't need three guesses
And not even two
To know that I'm the one
Sweetheart
Are you absolutely sure?
You can see her any night at that place, all of her.
- How fascinating. I'll look into it.
- Yes, I thought you'd want to do that.
You can take my word for it that Operation Crepe Suzette has never existed, except in bed.
And no doubt he's operating right now.
You sound jealous.
Don't be an ass.
And how was everything at the front?
Fine.
Fine.
- Hurt yourself?
- No, it's nothing.
- Just a flesh wound.
- It's nothing serious.
- Was it the Baron again?
- No.
This time, believe it or not,
I happened to be up in a German plane.
"Believe it or not. " Well, well.
Why don't you tell me all about it?
Lili...
- What's up?
- Up?
- Funny you should mention that.
- What?
You were...
You were up. In the air, so to speak.
- Sort of a pun.
- A pun?
Darling, I'm sorry. I'm not myself today.
I've been worried to death about you, and then you come in limping on that thing, and you must admit that under the circumstances, it's a bit difficult to be reasonable and calm.
You...
You really worried about me?
Come on, now. Tell me all about it.
We did run into the Baron.
- T.C. Got shot down.
- No.
- He's all right.
- Thank God.
I managed to land nearby, but before I could find T. C., the Germans found me.
- You were behind enemy lines.
- Yeah.
- How frightful.
- Yeah.
- I had to burn my plane.
- That sweet little plane?
I had no choice.
A lucky shot put my plane out of action.
- I had to make a run for it.
- All the way to France?
No, I mean...
We did have to cover quite a bit of territory.
- We?
- T.C. And I.
- You found him again.
- Yeah.
And yesterday morning we stumbled on a German airfield and we stole von Richthofen's plane.
You must be exhausted.
A little.
What?
Did you really steal von Richthofen's plane?
Yes.
In a pig's eye, you did.
Lili! Lili!
Lili, open this door!
Lili!
- Yes!
- Lili?
Yes.
Unfortunately, your friend, the Major, has borrowed the Baron's plane.
Lili!
You mean, he really did steal von Richthofen's plane?
Lili?
- Bill! Bill!
- No.
- Darling, it must've been awful.
- Damn it to hell, Lili.
- Come on, lean on me.
- No, wait.
- Please don't scold.
- I'm not going to scold.
- I just want to get things straight.
- But I believe you.
- No, you don't.
- I do.
How do I know? You're not dependable about these things.
I promise, I swear,
I'll never ever doubt you again.
- Yes, you will.
- I won't.
- I don't trust you.
- But I believe, honestly.
Come on, let's get you off your feet.
I'm sorry.
No. No, Lili.
- I can't stay.
- You can't?
There's something important
I've got to take care of.
- Right now?
- Right now.
- This minute?
- It can't wait.
Lili,
- do you believe?
- Of course, I believe it.
But what in the world could be so important that...
Do you believe?
- I believe.
- Okay.
- See you soon.
- How soon?
Just as soon as I can make it.
I believe.
Bedford, get the car!
Should I follow them?
No.
Take this and put it under her mattress.
That's our codebook.
When they've been arrested we'll change the code, now move!
- Capitaine Duvalle.
- Captain Duvalle, this is Lili Smith.
Mademoiselle Smith.
You know how I've resisted your allegations concerning Major Larrabee.
Well, there is something
I now feel I must tell you.
Major Larrabee has said several things which make it absolutely clear that he is indeed passing important military information to this... This Suzette.
- Major Larrabee?
- Yes.
- Suzette Maldue?
- Oui.
I am Captain Duvalle of army intelligence.
Yes.
I must regrettably inform you, and you, Miss Maldue, that you are both under arrest.
- Under arrest?
- What for?
High treason.
- What in the hell are you talking about?
- Please, Major.
"According to Captain Duvalle of French army intelligence
"a search of Miss Maldue's lodgings
"turned up vital and damaging evidence. "
You realise what this means, Lili?
- You can change the code.
- It's been changed already.
It's not so easy to replace Major Larrabee.
Would it have been easier to replace me?
Captain Duvalle was suspicious of Suzette, but sooner or later, he was bound to discover the truth, unless he had positive evidence against her.
I decided to protect myself by providing him with that evidence.
- And eliminate a rival.
- Don't be an ass.
That's the second time you've called me that.
Really?
The first time was when I suggested that you might be becoming emotionally involved.
Yes, I remember.
And the second time was when I suggested that you might be becoming emotionally involved.
Lili, surely you must've known that by implicating Suzette you could not help but implicate the Major.
Do you really love him so much?
Here we are.
Try to look reasonably happy.
After all, it isn't every day that a German spy is awarded the French Legion of Honour.
Of course
I had an affair with Major Larrabee.
But, he only took me out to tell me it was finished and that he was in love with Lili Smith.
We would like to believe you, but...
Until such time as the court-martial is convened, you are under military arrest. And you will be confined to your quarters.
Dismissed.
My dear, don't worry.
Have a good journey. Enjoy your rest.
I'll probably pay you a visit sometime next month to discuss the future.
Goodbye, Kurt.
Come in, and close the door.
I have an important message for you from your friend, the Kaiser.
I gather I'm no longer in His Majesty's good graces.
How did you guess?
Because you would naturally choose to deliver such a message yourself, and it's the first time
I've ever seen you look happy.
I recall once when I was in Africa watching a jackal devouring a kill, it had a similar look on its face.
I'm under orders to take you back to Germany to face a court-martial.
But don't think for a moment that I wouldn't be just as pleased to turn in a report that you refused to go.
And were shot trying to escape.
Shot by you, General, or by your hatchet man, Kraus?
By the way, where is Kraus?
Taking care of some last-minute business.
- Tea, Miss Lili?
- Yes.
And we'd better start packing.
- Have you seen the evening paper?
- No.
Don't let her see this.
If she asks, make an excuse.
- But after all she's been through.
- She's been through too much.
If she sees this, there's no telling what'll happen.
- But she loves him and she's miserable.
- And it's too late to do anything about it.
We're only one step ahead of a firing squad, as it is.
Now don't you start getting sentimental and muck things up.
Would it make any difference if he loved you?
According to the evening paper,
Suzette Maldue claimed she knew nothing about the codebook and that Major Larrabee only took her out that afternoon to tell her he was in love with another woman.
According to the evening paper.
- Where is it?
- Bedford didn't want you to see it.
He was afraid you might do something foolish.
No.
That should be Kraus.
Hello?
That wasn't the Colonel.
- What should we do?
- Pack.
Yes?
I followed her to the French Intelligence Headquarters.
Eliminate her.
The moment she sets foot outside of that building, get her.
Schnell.
- I have a taxi.
- No, we'll take my car.
Hey!
Hey, what are you trying to do?
Follow that car.
I am a German spy.
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes.
Yes, I understand what you are saying.
I also understand why you are saying it.
Major Larrabee is innocent.
I was the one who had the codebook planted under what's-her-name's mattress.
I have come to make a full confession.
Mademoiselle Smith, it's a wonderful, romantic gesture.
And as a Frenchman
I appreciate everything that you are trying to do, but...
Yes, what is it?
How does she know that the codebook was under the mattress?
How do I know how she knew that the codebook was under the mattress?
You must forgive him.
How did you know that the codebook was under the mattress?
Gentlemen. Lili, let's go.
Let's run.
It's no good, Kurt.
I told them, I confessed.
I didn't implicate you or any of the others but they know about me.
You're bleeding, you should see a doctor.
- Bedford, drive to Dr Rene's house.
- We are not going to Dr Rene's house.
- But you must get this seen to.
- We are going to the railway station.
- Railway station?
- And then we're going to Switzerland.
Switzerland? You can go to Switzerland, but I can't go.
I told them, they know about me.
I wasn't joking. I told them.
- I'm sure you did.
- What if you're seen with me?
- May I please say something?
- What?
For someone who's always been the personification of quick-wittedness and indefectible judgement, you're suddenly making decisions with all the cunning of a headless chicken.
What do you mean?
Look, you confessed in order to save Major Larrabee.
- Yes.
- Because he is innocent.
- Yes.
- Is he?
Don't be an ass.
He didn't tell that woman a thing.
- Which woman?
- Suzette. She's not a spy.
- But he told you.
- Of course he did.
And you are a spy.
And Suzette, who is not, has a good chance of proving that she is not, thereby exonerating the Major.
Because without the real spy the government has no case.
But now, my dear, they have.
Oh, my God.
And so you have no alternative.
If you stay and are convicted, the Major will undoubtedly face a court-martial, but if you can escape to Switzerland and remain there incommunicado until the appropriate time, you might just save us all.
How could I have been such an idiot?
Here.
I'm going to cover you up with this.
Try to sit quietly, and don't move around too much.
- Yes, nurse.
- Don't be patronising.
Put your feet up.
The best thing for us will be to hide at the farm for a few days
- before we try Switzerland.
- What about the Colonel and Miss Lili?
If there's no trouble, they'll be across the border by morning.
Don't be unhappy, darling, because there's a good possibility the fighting will be over before too very long, and then, if he really loves you, he'll find you, wherever you are.
He'd be better off if he didn't.
I always seem to mess things up.
I tried to put it all right, and it all went wrong.
I wanted so to justify your confidence in me.
I've always admired you and loved you and respected you, and what happens?
He gets court-martialled, and you get shot, and here I am on this wretched train going to Switzerland.
Well, we have one consolation, things can't get much worse.
You think it's funny?
Lili Smith tells you she's a German spy and you don't think it's funny?
I admit that at first, it did seem somewhat implausible.
Implausible?
At first I thought it nothing more than an attempt to exonerate you.
But she was in possession of certain facts.
Gentlemen,
- Lili's an actress.
- Of course, I considered that,
- but when she was kidnapped...
- Kidnapped?
- Yes, it seemed...
- Did you say kidnapped?
Yes. We were bringing her to see you to confront you with the evidence.
- Who kidnapped her?
- We've no idea.
- Major, please. I must insist.
- Shut up.
A man jumped out of the car, there were some shots and poof!
- What do you mean "poof"?
- She was gone.
Captain Duvalle's best suit.
- What did you do about it?
- Why, we came to see you.
We thought perhaps you might shed some light on the matter.
This is the bathroom.
Yep.
Major?
- Let's go, T.C.
- Just a moment.
No, do you speak English?
No, you don't speak English.
Don't worry about it.
- Sue. What's "sue"?
- Drunk.
Drunk. No, don't worry about it.
- Let's go, T.C.
- There you are, old cock.
Just a minute, garçon.
- Why don't you shoot?
- He can't.
He doesn't have the necessary authority.
He was doing pretty well earlier this evening.
Herr Kraus is not trying to kill me.
He has orders only to eliminate you, but he cannot do that now.
Why not?
Because he knows that if he shoots you, he will most certainly have to kill me.
- Don't underestimate me, Colonel.
- I don't think I do.
Killing me without proper orders could lead to a firing squad or, at the very least, a general court martial.
Shortly before we reach Switzerland,
I shall stop this train, and we shall get off.
Then it is only a few hundred yards from the German border.
Make yourself comfortable, my dear.
Try to relax.
We have several hours to go, yet.
- Unless I am provoked.
- Of course.
But why are we going to her house?
Because if she's a spy, there is a very good chance that the butler and the maid are in league with her.
- But why are we taking this road?
- Don't be an idiot.
We must take them by surprise, so we must enter by the back way.
Hello!
Anybody here?
- Hello!
- Hello!
Hey!
I can't take you any place.
He forced me to order von Richthofen's squadron to attack the train at dawn before it reaches the Swiss border.
Then he wrecked the transmitter.
Look.
Often I think this sad old world is whistling in the dark
Just like a child who, late from school walks bravely home through the park
To keep their spirits soaring and keep the night at bay
Neither quite knowing which way they are going they sing the shadows away
Often I think my poor old heart has given up for good has given up for good
And then I see a brand new face
I glimpse some new neighbourhood
So walk me back home my darling tell me dreams really come true
Whistling whistling here in the dark with you
So walk me back home my darling tell me dreams really come true
Whistling whistling here in the dark with you
It's a long way to Tipperary
It's a long way to go
It's a long way to Tipperary
To the sweetest girl I know
Goodbye, Piccadilly
Farewell, Leicester Square
It's a long, long way to Tipperary
But my heart's right there
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
And if somebody loved me like she done me
Ooh she done me
She done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Ooh she done me
She done me good
Vamos cantar só a música melada.
Sim, a música melada...
Só prá terminar esta parte e depois...
sei lá, sabem, nós fazemos melhor quando...
Mas não se não houver continuidade e ficarmos dando voltas.
Eu sei, então vamos em frente agora.
Agora, mais uma Bang

Back in school again
Maxwell is the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay late when they're gone away
Teacher stays behind
Writin' a thousand lines
"I must not ow ow ow..."
But as she turn 'round ow ow ow
Yeah...
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
So...yeh...

Bang, Bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that Maxwell's dead...
Ok...
Fotos para o álbum!
Na verdade é um pouco...
Choques eletronicos?!
Jim, posso chamar sua atenção?
Ele levou um choque!
Acabei de levar um choque aqui.
Tudo isso!
Como aconteceu George?
Eu segurei nos dois juntos.
Segure firme na ponta dos dois.
Não aconteceu nada.
Agora cante neles.
Começou assim...
E também estou usando sapatos de borracha.
E você é feito de madeira?
Segure-os ao mesmo tempo e veja o que acontece.
Deixe-me tentar novamente.
É óbvio que tem algo a ver com a sua guitarra.
Certo, mas ela está desligada.
Aposto que não.
Se esse rapaz morrer você estará em apuros.
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters on my wall.
You and me burning papers, standing....on our way back home.
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're going home.
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
....in the sun.
You and me chasing paper,
Getting nowhere on our way back home.
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're goin' home
On our way home back home
On our way home back home
On our way home back home
We're goin' home!
Ev'rybody had a hard year
Ev'rybody had a good time
Ev'rybody had a wet dream,
Ev'rybody saw the sunshine
Ev'rybody had a hard year
Ev'rybody let their hair down
Ev'rybody pulled their socks up
Ev'rybody put their foot down
Yeah I've got a feeling.
Está descendo demais a nota.
Não...
Deveria ser... sem pulos.
Tente descendo, descendo, assim...
Vamos tentar comigo cantando.
OK, então vamos com a parte do meio.
1, 2, 3, 4...
All these years
I've been wandering around
Wonderin' why how come nobody told me
All that I been lookin' for was somebody
Who looked like you. Oh!
I've got a feeling, that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
I've got a feeling,
I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
I've got a feeling, yeah
Ev'rybody had a hard year
Ev'rybody had a good time
Ev'rybody had a wet dream everybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah yeah
I've got a feeling!
A rainha disse "Não" aos caras do FBI que fumam maconha.
Oh, Darling!
Please, believe me!
Adorável, isso é ótimo.
Uma verdadeira viagem no túnel do tempo.
Paul, em que música você estava trabalhando na noite passada?
Era "One after 909".
Ah, sim, é fantástica.
Ótimo!
Qual?
Na verdade, eu nunca considerei essa...
pois foi uma das primeiras músicas que fizemos.
Nós matávamos as aulas...
e íamos prá minha casa depois da escola.
Nós dois nos sentamos e a escrevemos
"Love me do''
'Too Bad About Sorrows'
E há muita coisa daquela época.
Há umas 100 canções daquela época que nem considerávamos
porque não eram sofisticadas como...
"They said our love was just fun...
the day that our friendship begun...
There's no blue moon that I can see...
there's never been in history."
Mas isso é ótimo, sabe, são boas...
E tem outra...
é que nós sempre odiamos a letra de one after 909.
"Baby said She's travelling on the one after 909...
"She said move over honey,
I'm traveling on that line...
"I said move over honey...
"Move over twice...
"Come on baby, don't be cold as ice.
Move over once,
Move over twice.
C'mon baby, don't be cold as ice,
Said she's travellin' on one after 909
Well I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knee
Said you're only fooling around, only fooling around with me
Railman said: you got the wrong location.
I got my bag, run right home
Then I find,
I've got the number wrong
Move over once,
Move over twice.
C'mon baby, don't be cold as ice,
Said she's travellin' on one after 90...
Said she's travellin' on one after 90...
Said she's travellin' on one after 909
- Bom dia, Paul.
- Bom dia, Rich.
- Como você está esta manhã?
- OK!
Well, I bought the piano the other day
I didn't know what songs to play
I had to play the older theme
Oh! baby...
Pronto, eu já terminei.
Bom, já troquei...
OK, vamos fazer de novo desde o início.
1, 2, 3, 4...
Chegue mais perto do microfone.
É que eu não estou ouvindo você.
Tá legal, você manda...
Sabem, nós ficamos só dando voltas por uma hora e não fizemos nada.
Os ''riffs'', não há ''riffs''.
Mas você e eu...
"You and I are memories..."
"Memories" não está em sintonia...
Mas nós podemos tocar até...
ou podemos parar e dizer que não está sintonizado.
Se tivéssemos um gravador aqui...
você jogaria isso fora na hora.
Sim, certo, mas está complicado agora.
Então, vamos simplificar...
e depois complicar onde precisar de complicação.
Não é complicado...
Eu tocarei somente o que você quiser.
Não, você sempre se irrita e eu só estou tentando ajudar.
mas sempre acabo te irritando.
Eu estou tentando...
Não, você não me irrita de jeito nenhum.
vai demorar mais se você...
Olha, eu não estou dizendo isso...
e você está fazendo parecer que quero dizer isso.
Lembra do que falamos outro dia?
Eu não estou querendo provocar você.
Estou tentando dizer: vamos gente!
O grupo!
vamos tentar desta forma?
É estranho que...
Nessa música você estava tocando como tocou em Hey Jude
e eu acho que...
Não me importo, eu tocarei o que você quiser...
e também nem toco nada se você não quiser.
Eu só vou fazer o que e como você quiser.
Podemos ouvir agora como ficaram as gravações.
Será que é porque não estamos a fim...
ou a parte da guitarra ficou boa?
vamos tentar com menos...
Nothing's gonna change my...
vamos cantar uma vez...
e depois duas no final.
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Jai Guru Deva On
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Ah-ha... I
Dig a Pony
You can celebrate anything you want
You can celebrate anything you want
Because...
Ah-ha-ha I pick a hound dog
You can celebrate anything you want
You can celebrate anything you want
Because...
All I want is you...
Dig a pony!
Alguém tem uma música rápida?
Well come on Suzy's Parlour, everybody's welcome to come
Said come on Suzy's Parlour, everybody's welcome to come
(Come Suzy Parker, come, Suzy Parker)
When you get to Suzy's Parlour everybody gets well done
(Come Suzy Parker, come, Suzy Parker)
I said go little Suzy
I said go little Suzy
I said go little Suzy
I said Da Da Da Da...
Com'on little Suzy, everybody gets well done!
Chama-se ''I Me Mine''.
Quer que eu cante prá você?
Não me importo se não a quiser no seu show.
Pode colocá-la num musical...
É uma valsa pesada.
All thru' the day
I Me Mine, I Me Mine, I Me Mine!
All thru' the night
I Me Mine, I Me Mine, I Me Mine!
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Ev'ryone's weaving it,
Coming on strong all the time,
All thru' the day I me mine.
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
Ev'ryone's saying it,
Flowing more freely than wine,
All thru' the day
I me mine.
I-I-me-me mine,
I-I-me-me mine,
I-I-me-me mine,
I-I-me-me mine,
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine.
No-one's frightened of playing it
Ev'ryone's saying it,
Flowing like wine,
All thru' your life...
I me mine.
Because you're sweet and lovely,
I love you,
Because you're sweet and lovely girl it's true,
I love you more than ever girl I do.
I want you in the morning girl
I love you,
I want you at the moment
I feel blue,
I'm living ev'ry moment girl for you.
Because you're sweet and lovely girl
I love you.
Because you're sweet and lovely girl
It's true!
I love you more than ever girl I do.
"I Dig A Pigmy" de Charles Hawtry e seus assistentes surdos...
Capítulo Um, no qual Doris faz sexo.
Eu vou inventando...
Sabe o Capítulo Dois...
Ah, assisti a um filme ontem à noite.
O Que?
Estava na casa do Maharishi.
Eu tenho o filme inteiro.
Incrível.
Ele tem um início excelente.
O trecho com o helicóptero no ar?
É, eu vi você entrando nele.
É incrível como ele retrata tudo o que estamos fazendo.
O que vocês estavam fazendo?
O que estávamos fazendo?
Eu realmente não sei...
exceto que deixamos nossas personalidades de lado.
Nós não éramos muito verdadeiros.
Sabe, nós podíamos como que...
nos escondermos atrás de alguém na escola.
E você pode ver no filme que é bem parecido...
com a escola e deveríamos ter falado.
você deve chamar o filme de...
"O que fizemos em nossas férias''.
Bem, sabe...
Aposto que não vai chamá-lo assim.
Há uma cena bem distante com você andando...
com o Maharishi e não parece você.
Sabe, do tipo "Conte-me velho Mestre!"
E aquela outra coisa que você disse.
Quando você subiu no helicóptero com ele...
e pensou que talvez ele te dissesse a resposta.
Besame...
Besame mucho
(Each time I kiss your lips
I hear music divine)
Besame...
Besame mucho
Love me forever and say that you'll always be mine!
Little one,
Hold me so closely. when I am kissin' your lips
I am feeling divine.
Besame...
Besame mucho
Love me forever and say that you'll always be mine!
Oh this joy is something new,
My arms enfolding you,
I never knew this thrill before.
I'd be Holding you... closer I'd be holdin' you...
Never felt this way before cha-cha-boom, love me forever and say that you'll always...
...be mine!
"Toda vez que o vejo ele diz olá e entra."
"Cada vez que o vejo ele diz olá".
"Mas tenho que partir!"
Faça assim e volte aqui...
E dai vai para ré menor...
E depois volta para dó.
Vou tocar o violão.
I'd like to be underneath the sea
In an octopus' garden by the shade
It would nice... paradise
In an octopus' garden by the shade
I'd like to be underneath the sea
In an octopus' garden by the shade
It would nice... paradise
In an octopus' garden by the shade
In an octopus' garden by the shade
Já tocou a bateria do Octopus?
Sim, terrível...
Terrível.
É bateria rudimentar?
Sim e muito rudimentar...
mas Get Back ficou ótimo.
Eu deixei minha guitarra.
A única música boa foi Get Back.
Mas não foi nada especial.
Isadora DunKan trabalhava na TelefunKen.
I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always thinkin' of you
Oh oh oh

My love's strong now

Hold me!
Hold me!

The long and winding road that leads to your door
You left me standing here a long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here lead me to your door!
But still they lead me back... the long and winding road!
Vamos lá, rapazes...
Chega, senão não paramos mais.
The long and winding road that leads to your door.
Yeah, alright...
Will never disappear!
Mal, você vai ter que conseguir...
todos estes instrumentos afinados em conjunto.
O órgão e piano têm que...
ser afinados juntos.
Flyin' high..
Don't mind to the groovy sky...
I don't care if I spent my dough
Tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul.
Gonna rock it up!
Gonna shake it up!
We're gonna roll it up.
Oh, at the ball tonight.
Rattle and roll,

To save your doggone soul.
Well, get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
Well, get out of that kitchen

You're the devil in a frying pan.
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
You never done nothing
To save your doggone soul.
Hey, yeah, com'on shake!
I'm a one-eyed cat, peepin' in a sea-food store
I'm like a one-eyed cat, peepin' in a sea-food store
I can do the shake, tell you don't love me no more!
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle and roll
You never done nothing
To save your doggone soul.

B.B. King and Doris Day!
Matt Busby
Dig it! Dig it! Dig it! Dig it!
Dig it! Dig it! Dig it! Dig it!
Dig it, if you want it, if you get it, if you want it, if you need it,
If you asked for, anytime of the day!
Come on!
C'mon and dig it!
Any time of day...
Any time of night!
Can you dit it in the morning,
Dig it every evening...
Dig it everytime of day if you want it all you gotta do is ask for...nicely!
It's free and you're gonna get it
You're gonna get it, all right!
And you're gonna get it!
Yeah, you're gonna get it
And yes you're gonna get it good!
Yeah yeah yeah!
That was "Can you dig it?" by George Wood.
Sempre que conversamos discutimos...
Veja essa do George.
Perguntei o que ele queria fazer...
e ele disse "nada de filmes".
Mas isto está errado, muito errado.
Porque nunca se sabe...
Nada parecido com "Help!" ou
"A Hard Day's Night",
eu concordo...
Mas filmes ?
Isto aqui é um filme!
Agora ele não se importa em fazer este?
Mas esse tipo de coisa que ele diz...
nada de televisão, nada de platéia.
Quero dizer que quando voltamos de Hamburgo,
e fizemos Leicester du Montford Hall,
ou Coventry.
Tocávamos em salões de bailes...
e tivemos a primeira pior noite imaginável.
Estávamos todos nervosos e foi terrível.
E na noite seguinte, tocamos novamente...
e foi um pouco melhor.
e a noite seguinte... e a próxima...
foi demais, e tocamos bem,
e nos acostumamos com a platéia...
e parecia que não havia mais ninguém lá.
Era uma nova sensação...
e tinha um cara em frente vendo você tocar...
e nós estávamos ligados.
E aqueles shows, se tivessem sido gravados,
seriam os melhores.
Porque na minha opinião,
é aquela coisa de equilíbrio.
E uma vez que o nervosismo passa,
nós somos bons nisso.
Mas parece que aquela barreira do nervosismo...
está aqui agora...
e não estamos conseguindo...
superá-la desta vez.
A não ser que fôssemos ao Albert Hall...
e fizéssemos um show.
A única alternativa é dizer...
que nunca mais iremos tocar...
diante de uma platéia.
Mas se pretendemos manter...
algum tipo de contato nesse cenário...
Bem, entendo quando o George diz que não faz sentido...
porque é como Stravinsky.
E está na música...
E as guitarras nunca mais se levantarão e tocarão.
Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's hard earned pay,
You and me Sunday driving,
Not arriving on our way back home.
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're going home.
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters on my wall.
You and me burning matches,
Lifting latches on our way back home.
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're going home.
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun.
You and me chasing paper,
Getting nowhere on our way back home.
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're goin' home.
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun.
You and me chasing paper,
Getting nowhere on our way back home
We're on our way home,
We're on our way home,
We're goin' home.
Goodbye!
We're on our way home.
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be!
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, Let it be, let it be, let it be!
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, Let it be, let it be, let it be!
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, Let it be, let it be, let it be!
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, Let it be, let it be, let it be!
There will be an answer, let it be.
And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music,
Mother Mary comes to me,
There will be no sorrow, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be.
There will be no sorrow, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
The long and winding road that leads to your door,
Will never disappear,
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here, lead me to your door.
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away,
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way.
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried,
Anyway you've always known the many ways I've tried,
But still they lead me back to the long winding road,
You left me waiting here a long, long time ago.
Don't keep me standing here, lead me to your door.
But still they lead me back to the long winding road,
You left me waiting here a long, long time ago.
Don't leave me standing here lead me to your door!
Lugar bem seguro aqui, não acha?
Mal!
Você me pregou no lugar errado.
Pode pegar o clapper.
Pegue o clapper, oK?
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson,
Arizona
For some California Grass.

Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jo.
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can.
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Loretta!
Your mother's waiting for you
Wearing her high-heel shoes
And her low-neck sweater
Get back Loretta!
Get back!
Get back!
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back, get back!
Get back home!
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back home
Every morning roam...
Get back, get back!
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back...
Get back to where you once belonged.
Recebemos um pedido de Daisy,
Morris e Tommy.
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Nobody ever loved me like she does
Ooh she does. Yes she does

Ooh she do me. Yes she does
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

It's a love that has no past
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

Ooh she done me
She done me good
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down.
I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Acho que os Beatles são demais.
Não existe ninguém melhor.
Eles são únicos.
Eles têm uma estrela própria.
E na minha opinião, eles são uns caras legais,
muito bons e cantam bem.
E o que mais posso dizer?
São todos gente muito boa.
Yeah I've got a feeling.
Oh please believe me
I'd hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
And if you leave me
I won't be late again
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no.
Yeah I've got a feeling yeah.
All these years
I've been wandering around,
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you.
Isso não faz sentido!
Sim, acho ótimo, quero dizer,
deixa o trabalho do escritório mais excitante.
Esse tipo de música é legal e agradável mas no seu devido lugar.
Só que é um grande abuso eles atrapalharem tudo por aqui.
Ev'rybody had a hard year
Ev'rybody had a good time
Ev'rybody had a wet dream,
Ev'rybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ev'rybody had a good year,
Ev'rybody let their hair down,
Ev'rybody pulled their socks up,
Ev'rybody put their foot down.
Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh yeah.
Ev'rybody had a hard year

Fabuloso.
Com certeza fantástico.
É bom ter algo de graça neste país no momento, não é?
É o novo disco deles?
Ótimo! Tenho apenas 5.
My baby says she's travelin' on the One after 909
I said move over honey
I'm traveling on that line.
I said move over once, move over twice,
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice.
I said I'm traveling on the One after Nine-O-Nine.
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees,
You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me.
I said move over once, move over twice,
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
I said I'm traveling on the One after 909!
I've got my bag,
Run to the station.
Railman says
"you got the wrong location!"
I've got my bag.
Run right home.
Then I find...
I've got the number wrong,
Well I said I'm travelin' on the One after 909
I said move over honey
I'm traveling on that line.
I said move over once, move over twice,
Come on baby don't be cold as ice.
I said we're traveling on the One after 909...
I got my bag, run to the station
Railman said
"You got the wrong location!"
I got my bag
Run right home!
Then I find,
I got the number wrong
Said we're travellin' on the one after 909
I said move over honey
I'm traveling on that line.
I said move over once, move over twice,

Said we're travellin' on the one after 90...

Oh Danny Boy, the oats of Anne are calling!"

Obrigado pelo ensaio...
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last.
Jojo left his home in Tucson,
Arizona
For some California Grass.
Get back, get back.

Get back, get back.
Get back to where you once belonged.
Get back Jojo!
Get back, get back.

Então volte!
Get back!
Yeah yeh yeh...
Get back, get back!
Get back to where you once belonged.

Obrigado Mal!
Agradeço em meu nome e do grupo e...
espero que tenhamos passado no teste.
By edict of the Inquisition... to spread subversive thought is heresy.
By edict of the Inquisition... offenders will submit to purification... by sword or flame.
By edict of the Holy Office of the Inquisition... to read or interpret the Bible... is a sole province of the Church.
You must by no means prevail with yourself... that these giants you speak of... were ever real men of this world... and true substantial flesh and blood.
Confess!
What you say of all of them... is fable and fiction, lies and dreams.
The Holy Bible... which cannot deviate an atom from the truth... tells us of that huge Philistine Goliath... who was fourteen and a half feet high... which is an prodigious stature.
You blaspheme by quoting the Holy Bible... for your purposes.
The interpretation of holy writ... is the sacred function of the Friars.
We cannot all be Friars.
And there are many ways
God leads his children home.
Religion is knight-errantry.
Miguel de Cervantes.
Truth is only revealed... or dreamt.
Miguel de Cervantes... in the name of the Holy Office of the Inquisition... you are under arrest.
Anything wrong with the accommodations?
Oh, no, no, no.
They're quite... interesting.
This is what we've come to regard... as the common room.
For those who wait.
Do they wait long?
An hour... a lifetime.
Who knows?
Do they all await the Inquisitions?
Ah, no, señor.
Not all of them.
Most of these... are merely thieves and murderers.
Oh.
If you want anything, just shout.
If you are able.
What did he mean by that?
He meant to frighten us.
I think they intend us to stay.
You think? God!
Calm yourself.
There's a remedy for everything but death.
That may be just the remedy we need.
Good day, gentlemen, ladies.
I regret being thrust upon you in this manner.
I hope you'll not find our company objectionable.
I'm no stranger to similar surroundings.
I've been in prison more than once.
- Many times.
- Many times.
And often I have thought the world to be a prison... a very cruel one... where all have desires... few of which are fulfilled.
But how thoughtless of me to...
Enough! Enough!
Noise, trouble, fights.
Kill each other if you must... but for God's sake, do it quietly.
Who are you?
Huh? Speak up!
Cervantes.
Don Miguel de Cervantes.
Oh, a gentleman!
Doesn't prevent me from going to bed hungry.
And that?
My assistant.
May I have the honor?
They call me the Governor.
- What's your game?
- Game?
Your speciality, man.
Cutpurse? Highwayman?
Nothing so rewarding.
I'm a poet.
They're putting people in prison for that?
No, no, no, not for that.
Too bad.
Might I meet this gentleman?
Your name, sir?
Names have no meaning here.
I'm called the Duke.
And your speciality?
Treason.
I invent false information about a country... and sell it to others stupid enough to believe it.
Seems a sound proposition.
What brought you here?
A lapse of judgment.
I told the truth.
- Did you like your job?
- Quite.
Do you like yourself?
I believe I could learn to dislike you.
Well, now, let's get on with the trial.
Trial? What trial?
Yours, of course.
And what have I done?
We'll soon find something.
But we don't understand.
We've only been here a few hours.
My dear sir, no one enters or leaves this prison... without being tried by his fellow prisoners.
And if I'm found guilty?
- You will be.
- The sentence?
We generally fine a prisoner all his possessions.
All of them?
It's not practical to take more.
But these things are my livelihood.
I thought you said you were a poet.
Of the theater.
Of the theater.
- You see?
- What?
Come here. Come here.
Oh!
False.
Properties and costumes.
You see, I'm a playwright and an actor.
So these poor things... couldn't possibly be of any use to you.
Oh, no, wait!
You'll break it!
Take them! Take them!
Oh, no, Don Miguel!
No. Take them, I say.
Only leave me this.
Heavy. Valuable?
Only to me.
I'll let you ransom it.
I have no money.
How unfortunate.
Paper!
Manuscript.
Still worthless!
No! Wait!
You said a trial!
By your own words,
I demand a trial!
Oh, very well, then.
I hereby declare this court to be in session.
Now, then, what are you here for?
We are to appear before the Inquisition.
Heresy?
No, not exactly.
You see, we were presenting an entertainment.
An entertainment?
How does an entertainment get into trouble... with the Inquisition?
Perhaps they found an entertainment... is not always what it seems.
Why are you here?
Somebody has to stage-manage the stage.
These two have empty holes in their heads.
Governor, if you don't mind...
I should like to prosecute this case.
You, sir? Why, sir?
Poets... spinning nonsense out of nothing.
Blurring men's eyes to reality.
Exactly!
Reality!
A stone prison crushing the human spirit.
Poetry demands imagination.
And with imagination, you may discover a dream.
The trial! On with the trial!
Miguel de Cervantes,
I charge you... with being an idealist, a bad poet... and an honest man.
How plead you?
Guilty.
Bravo!
Your Excellency... ladies and gentlemen, my defense.
But you just pleaded guilty.
Had I said innocent, you would surely have found me guilty.
Since I've admitted guilt... the court is obliged to hear me out.
For what purpose?
The jury may choose to be lenient.
Clever!
He's trying to gain time.
Do you have a scarcity of time?
Any urgent appointments?
It is true I am guilty of these charges.
An idealist!
I've never had the courage to believe in nothing.
A bad poet?
This comes from a painful ear.
Have you finished your defense?
No, no, scarcely begun.
With your permission,
I will continue... in the manner I know best.
In the form of a charade.
Charade?
An entertainment, if you will.
An entertainment?
At worst, it may beguile the time.
And since my cast of characters is large...
I call upon you all to enter in... and play whatever role may suit your fancy.
Governor,
I shall like to protest.
No!
Let's hear him out.
If you've no objection... and with your kind permission... may I set the stage?
Proceed!
I will impersonate a man.
His name... Alonso Quijana.
A country gentleman, no longer young.
Being retired, he has much time for books.
He studies them from morn till night... and often through the night till morn again.
And all he reads oppresses him... fills him with indignation... at man's murderous ways towards man.
He ponders the problem... how to make better a world... where evil brings profit and virtue none at all.
Where fraud, deceit, and malice... are mingled with truth and sincerity.
He broods and broods and broods and broods... and broods and finally his brains dry up.
He lays down the melancholy burden of sanity... and conceives the strangest project ever imagined... to become a knight-errant, and sally forth... to roam the world in search of adventures... to right all wrongs, to mount a crusade... to raise up the weak and those in need.
He persuades his neighbor, one Sancho Panza... a country laborer and an honest man... if the poorer may be called honest... and he was poor, indeed, to become his squire.
He selects an ancient cart horse called Rosinante... to become his steed... and the safeguard of his master's will.
These preparations made, he seizes his lance.
No longer will he be plain Alonso Quijana... but a dauntless knight... known as
Don Quixote de La Mancha!
Hear me now
Oh, thou bleak and unbearable world
Thou art base and debauched as can be
And the knight with his banners all bravely unfurled
Now hurls down his gauntlet to thee
I am I, Don Quixote
The Lord of La Mancha
My destiny calls and I go
And the wild winds of fortune
Will carry me onward
Whithersoever they blow
Whithersoever they blow
Onward to glory I go
I'm Sancho
Yes, I'm Sancho
I'll follow my master till the end
I'll tell all the world proudly
I'm his squire
I'm his friend
Hear me, heathens and wizards
And serpents of sin
All your dastardly doings are past
For a holy endeavor is now to begin
And virtue shall triumph at last
- I am I, Don Quixote
- I am Sancho
- The Lord of La Mancha
- Yes, I am Sancho
- My destiny calls and I go
- Follow my master till the end
- And the wild winds of fortune
- I'll tell all the world
- Will carry me onward
- Proudly I'm his squire
- Whithersoever they blow
- I'm his friend
Whithersoever they blow
Onward to glory I go
Well, Sancho, likest thou adventuring?
It's marvelous, Your Grace, but it is peculiar.
This great road to glory...
Iooks exactly like the road to El Diboso... where you can buy chickens cheap.
'Tis a sign thou art little acquainted with adventuring.
Only wait, and thou shalt see amazing sights.
Like what?
There will be knights and nations... warlocks and wizards.
A cavalcade of vast, unending armies.
They sound dangerous.
They are dangerous.
But one there will be the most dangerous of all.
- Who?
- The Great Enchanter.
- The Great Enchanter?
- Yes. Beware him, Sancho.
His thoughts are cold, his soul shriveled... his eyes are little machines... and where he walks, the earth is blighted.
One day, I will meet him face to face.
Well, I wouldn't get upset,
Your Grace.
As I always say... have patience and shuffle the cards.
- Proverb?
- Yes, Your Grace.
Proverb piled on proverb, you never cease.
No, Your Grace,
I've got a belly full of them.
- As I always say...
- Sweet Jesu!
- Do you see him?
- Who?
The Great Enchanter!
- Dost thou not see?
- What?
The monstrous giant of infamous repute!
Whom I intend to encounter.
- It's a windmill.
- A giant.
A windmill.
A giant!
Canst thou not see... the four great arms a-whirling at his back?
A giant?
Exactly.
How long since we sallied forth?
About two minutes.
So soon will I engage in brave, unequaled combat.
Hold there, foul monster!
Cease the knocking of thy craven knees... and prepare to do battle!
I swear, Your Grace... by my wife's little black mustache...
- that is not...
- Charge!
Your Grace, wait!
Surrender!
Vile coward!
Surrender!
Surrender! Have at you!
Surrender, coward!
Vile creature, do not seek to bleat!
Hold on!
Hold on, Master!
Yield!
I'll show thee no mercy!
- Vile creature!
- Hold on!
Surrender, I tell thee!
Fall to thy knees and beg mercy!
Or I'll rob thee of thy very life!
Thou art vanquished!
Vanquished!
Vanquished!
- Hold on, Master!
- Surrender!
Have at you!
Surrender, vile creature!
Surrender!
Your Grace!
Your Grace!
Master!
Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I say,
"Your Grace, it's a windmill"?
The work of mine enemy!
The Enchanter?
He transformed the giant into a windmill... to prevent me the honor of victory.
You'd be wise to avoid him,
Your Grace.
One of these days, he'll get you killed.
Hell has not seen nor Heaven created... the one who can prevail against me.
He's doing very well.
Come, Your Grace.
We'll find a place to get you repaired.
A knight must not complain of his wounds... though his bowels be dropping out.
But we could find the hall of some great lord.
Listen!
What?
A trumpet heralding my approach.
There! The very place.
- Where?
- The castle.
- Castle?
- Rockbound amidst the mountains.
- Mountains?
- And the banners.
The brave banners flaunting the wind.
Blow thy bugle... that a dwarf may mount the battlements... and announce our presence.
But I don't see a castle.
What?
- I do see something.
- What?
- It looks like an inn.
- An inn?
An inn. We will repair... to the drawbridge of yonder castle... and there thy vision may improve it.
And there thy vision may improve it.
Reality.
To Sancho, an inn.
To Don Quixote, a castle.
To someone else, whatever.
But for sweet argument's sake, let us grant Sancho his version.
- An inn.
- An inn!
Governor, a kindly innkeeper.
A brothel keeper, if you like.
And his less kindly wife.
That's right.
A marriage of minds.
- God forbid!
- Mule drivers!
Hard men! Miles and miles on the road each day.
And a man to lead the men.
Pedro.
- Pedro?
- Pedro.
And for the men... beautiful women who please for profit.
Fermina!
And a most particular... kitchen maid... called Aldonza.
One to whom life has been discourteous.
A tigress crouching in the dark.
Still keen in tooth and claw.
- Take it, Aldonza.
- Aldonza!
Come on, Aldonza, take it!
- Aldonza!
- Take it!
Aldonza!
You want this on the table or over your lousy heads?
There, swine. Feed!
I brought you something.
Keep it till it grows up.
Little dogs have big ideas.
Tonight!
Payment in advance.
Aldonza!
Talk with your money, not your hands.
How about a nice thick bed of hay instead?
Good. Eat it.
You refuse Pedro?
Try me. Try me.
My mules are not so stubborn.
Fine. Make love to your mules.
Aldonza, I sell my mules.
Aldonza, I am the best lover!
Who cares? Just pay me!
One pair of arms is like another
I don't know why or who's to blame
I'll go with you or with your brother
It's all the same
It's all the same
This I have learned that when the light's out
No man will burn with special flame
You'll prove to me before the night's out
You're all the same
You're all the same
Not me, Aldonza!
So do not talk to me of love
I'm not a fool
With starry eyes
Just put your money in my hand
And you will get what money buys
When I am dead, no man will miss me
For life's a cruel and dirty game
So you can curse or you can kiss me
It's all the same
More wine, Aldonza!
It's all the same
Oh, I have seen too many beds
But I have known too little rest
And I have loved too many men
With hatred burning in my breast
Aldonza!
I do not like you or your brother
I do not like the life I live
But I am me
I am Aldonza
And what I give, I choose...
Choose!
One pair of arms is like another
It's all the same
It's all the same
Aldonza!
Well, gentlemen, everything in order?
Did you feed the mules?
- They're eating as well as you.
- Oh, no.
God forbid.
He jokes.
It's well-known that I set the finest table... between Madrid and Malaga.
My patrons have always...
It's the pig butcher.
I didn't expect him so early.
What in the name of?
Coming! Coming!
Señor butcher, coming!
Is the lord of the castle at hand?
I say, is the Castellano here?
I am in charge of this place.
We waited, sire, for a dwarf to mount the battlements... and announce us, but none appeared.
The, uh, the dwarfs, they're all busy.
My noble lords and ladies... my master Don Quixote...
- Knight-errant?
- Knight-errant... defender of the right, and pursuer of... of lofty undertakings requests the... boon?
The boon of hospitality!
Well, sir, is it granted?
Absolutely!
You see? I mean, this castle is open to everybody.
Master!
Master!
Master! Master!
Are you hurt?
One of the little mishaps of my profession.
He's a madman.
Madmen are the children of God.
Sir Knight, you must be hungry.
I am, sir.
There is food aplenty.
And for your squire, too.
Well, as I always say, hunger is the best gravy in the world.
And as the poor are always hungry... they, uh... sir, I thank you.
Stay and rest tonight.
I'll just stable your animal.
See that your grooms care for my fleet-footed Rosinante.
A horse of courage, sobriety, and chastity.
A flower and glory of horse flesh.
Thank you, Master.
- What's this madness?
- Aldonza!
Has he got money to pay?
When did a poor man ever find time to run mad?
He's got money.
He's a gentleman.
Tell Aldonza to bring him some wine.
Gentle knights... fair chatelaine.
If there be any amongst you that require assistance... you have but to speak... and my good right arm is at your service.
Whether it be a princess held to ransom... an army besieged... the fallen to be raised up... the suffering, the poor...
Dear God. It is she.
Sweet lady... fair virgin...
I dare not gaze fully upon thy countenance... as I'd be blinded by thy beauty.
I'll get you the wine.
Milady, you must not wait upon my needs.
I implore you, speak once your name.
Aldonza.
- Milady jests.
- Aldonza!
The name of a kitchen scullion or milady's serving maid!
I told you my name.
Now get out of the way, or I'Il... by Christ, I'Il...
Milady, think to put me to the test?
Oh, sweet sovereign of my captive heart... how could I fail thee when I know...
I have dreamed thee too long
Never seen thee or touched thee
But known thee with all of my heart
Half a prayer, half a song
Thou hast always been with me
Though we have been always apart
Dulcinea
Dulcinea
I see heaven when I see thee
Dulcinea
And thy name is like a prayer an angel whispers
Dulcinea
Dulcinea
If I reach out to thee
Do not tremble and shrink
From the touch of my hand on thy hair
Let my fingers but see
Thou art warm and alive
And no phantom to fade in the air
Dulcinea
Dulcinea
I have sought thee, sung thee, dreamed thee
Dulcinea
Now I've found thee, and the world shall know thy glory
Dulcinea
Dulcinea
Come along, Sir Knight.
I'll show you to your quarters.
Dulcinea.
Dulcinea.
- Dulcinea!
- Dulcinea!
Dulcinea
Dulcinea
I see heaven when I see thee
- Dulcinea
- Dulcinea
Filthy swine!
And thy name is like a prayer an angel whispers
Sons of whores!
Dulcinea
Dulcinea
Dulcinea
Dulcinea
I have sought thee, sung thee, dreamed thee
Dulcinea
Now I've found thee, and the world shall know thy glory
Dulcinea
Dulcinea
- Halt!
- Bastards!
Governor, this man proposed to offer a defense.
This is my defense.
The most curious
I've ever heard.
- But if it entertains?
- The word is "diverts."
I think your purpose is to divert us from ours.
Precisely. May I go on?
- Continue with your defense.
- Thank you.
Imagine now the family our brave night leaves behind.
Not the lords and ladies... and retainers of
Don Quixote de La Mancha... but the simple womenfolk of Alonso Quijana.
Think of the shock the news of his madness...
- brings to his niece...
- Antonia.
Antonia, who is concerned about the effect... on her forthcoming marriage.
Can't I have it?
Afterwards, princess, you can keep it... but now you're my niece concerned about marriage.
To his housekeeper of many years... pious lady, come on, come on... concerned that devils and darkness have overtaken him.
- And to the local priest...
- Please let me be him.
Who has known Alonso all of his life. One priest.
- Thank you.
- One priest!
And, shortly, there will appear a character... whose philosophy may appeal enormously... to you!
Antonia and the housekeeper hurry to the church.
- Church, please.
- The church.
Anguished by the situation... and not wholly unaware of what the neighbors may think... they seek advice from the priest.
Where's he gone?
Reverence.
To church.
But in spite of the trouble that Alonso's madness... will bring crashing on their heads... you may be sure they're only thinking of him.
I'm only thinking of him
I'm only thinking of him
Whatever I may do or say
I'm only thinking of him
In my body, it's well known
There is not one selfish bone
I'm only thinking and worrying about him
I've been told he's chasing dragons
And I fear it may be true
If my groom should hear about it
Heaven knows what he will do
Oh, they say he seeks a lady
Who his own true love shall be
God forbid that in his madness
He should ever think it's me
If he should try,
I'll surely die
And I will grimly guard my honor as I cry
- I'm only thinking of him
- I know, I know, my dear
- I'm only thinking of him
- Of course you are, my dear
- I'm only thinking of him
- I understand
Woe
Woe
They're only thinking of him
They're only thinking of him
How saintly is their plaintive plea
They're only thinking of him
What a comfort to be sure
That their motives are so pure
As they go thinking and worrying
About him
Now there appears on the scene a man of breeding...
Now there appears on the scene a man of breeding... intelligent, logical.
Dr. Sanson Carrasco...
Antonia's fiancé... bachelor of science... graduate of the University of Salamanca... a man who carries his own importance... as though afraid of breaking it.
Indeed.
Family quarrels get out of hand.
Shh! Shh!
Governor, with your permission... and so much at stake in the game... may I rearrange the pieces?
Señor, you have our permission.
The queen... cunning.
The castle... formidable.
The king... restricted.
The bishop... charmingly diagonal.
And now the problem of the knight.
My dear, your uncle... is the laughingstock of the entire neighborhood... and I do not relish claiming a lunatic as an uncle.
Oh, come, come, doctor.
The good Señor Quijana... has been carried away by his imagination.
Señor Quijana has lost his mind and is suffering from delusions.
- Is there a difference?
- Exactitude of meaning.
I beg to remind you
I am a doctor.
The innocent must pay for the sins of the guilty.
Guilty? Of what?
Of gentle delusion?
How do you know it is gentle?
He was armed.
With sword and lance.
I cannot favor the madness that puts a sword into his hand... but I can love the gentle spirit that moves him... to measure his sword with evil.
I shall concern myself with his madness, father... and leave the care of his spirit in your hands.
Sanson? I had hoped for so much for us, for you, really.
Everything was to be for you... my uncle's house, his lands.
That's true, doctor. In time, they would all be yours.
Or you a priest or pawnbroker?
What I meant was...
- consider the challenge.
- Challenge?
Think what cleverness it would take... to wean him from his madness.
Turn him from his course.
To persuade him to come back home.
To bring him to see the same world?
Hmm. That is a challenge.
Enormous.
To work within his lunacy... to cure him through the very terms that are his own.
Come, father. We shall do it.
We will return now to the inn, the kitchen.
Yay!
It is imperative each knight has a lady... for a knight without a lady... is a body without a soul.
To whom would he dedicate his conquests?
What vision sustain him when he sallies forth to do battle... with evil and with giants?
Don Quixote, having found his lady... sends Sancho Panza to her with a missive.
Missive? What's a missive?
It's a sort of letter.
He warned me to give it only into your hands.
Well, let's see it.
I can't read.
Neither can I, but my master, foreseeing such a possibility... recited it to me, so I could commit it to heart.
What made him think
I couldn't read?
Well, as he explained it... most noblewomen are so busy with their needlework...
Needlework?
Embroidering banners for their knights... he said they had no time for study.
What's it say?
Hmm
Most lovely sovereign and highborn lady
The heart of this, thy vassal knight
Faints for thy favor
Oh, fairest of the fair
Purest of the pure
Incomparable Dulcinea
Oh, that again!
My name is Aldonza.
- Master calls you Dulcinea.
- Why?
I don't know, but I can tell you from experience... that knights have their own language for everything... and it's better not to ask questions.
It only gets you into trouble.
Ahem.
I beg thee grant that I may kiss
The nethermost hem of thy garment
Kiss my what?
If you keep interrupting me like this... the whole thing will be gone right out of my head.
- Well, what's he want?
- I'm getting to it.
I beg thee grant that I may kiss
The nethermost hem of thy garment
And send to me a token of thy fair esteem
That I may carry as my standard into battle
What kind of a token?
He says generally it's a silken scarf.
Why, your master's a crack-brain.
Well, they say one madman makes a hundred... and love makes a thousand.
- What does that mean?
- I'm not sure.
You're crazy, too.
- What are you waiting for?
- The token.
I'll give him a token. Here!
But, milady...
Don't you milady me, or I'll crack you like an egg.
Hey, wait a moment.
Come here.
Come. Tell me.
Why do you follow him, huh?
Oh, that's easy to explain.
It's a... it's a... well, it's a sort of crusade.
Crusade?
And then there's all those people in distress.
Distress?
And, uh, well, uh, because, um...
- Why?
- I'm telling you.
- Because, um...
- Why?
I like him.
I really like him.
Tear out my fingernails
One by one
I like him
- That's no reason.
- I don't have
A very good reason
Since I've been with him
Cuckoo nuts have been in season
- You are crazy.
- But there's nothing I can do
Chop me up for onion stew
Still I'll yell to the sky
Though I can't tell you why
That I like him
He doesn't make any sense.
Well, that's because you're not a squire.
All right, you're a squire.
How does a squire squire?
Well, I ride behind him... and he fights, and then
I pick him up off the ground.
What do you get out of it?
- What do I get?
- Yes.
Plenty.
Why, already I've gotten...
You've gotten nothing, so why do you do it?
I like him
I really like him
Pluck me naked as a scalded chicken
I like him
Don't ask me
For why or wherefore
'Cause I don't have a single good because
Or therefore
You can chop me for croquettes
Beat my bones like castanets
Make me freeze, make me fry
Make me sigh, make me cry
Still I'll yell to the sky
Though I can't tell you why
That I like him
"Fairest of the fair.
Kiss the hem of thy garment."
"Incomparable."
"Dulcinea."
Your Grace!
Milady received thee?
Oh, most fortunate of squires.
The token. What of the token?
Gossamer.
Purest gossamer.
Forgive me.
I'm overcome.
Oh, I am a little barber
And I go my merry way
With my razor and my basin
I can always earn my pay
Somebody approacheth!
Though your chin be smooth as satin
You will need me soon, I know
For the lord protects his barbers
And he makes the stubble grow
Well, good day, gentlemen.
It's just an ordinary traveler.
Nay!
See what he weareth on his head.
By all the saints... there is a fortune to be made right here.
Arm thyself. This encounter may be perilous.
Oh, dear.
If I slip while I am shaving you
And cut you to the quick
You can use me as a doctor
'Cause I also heal the sick
Well, shall you be my... shall you be my first to...
You... you... you should be my... my first...
Oh, by the beard of St. Anthony...
I do believe I see before me... a knight... in full armor.
It's ridiculous.
There aren't any knights!
- What?
- I was wrong. Forgive me.
Forgive me, your... your... bigness.
I thought I'd been touched by the sun.
Thou wilt be touched by worse... unless thou surrender rapidly that golden helmet... which is justly mine.
Golden helmet?
But this is a shaving basin.
Shaving basin. Mister...
I must say, Your Grace, it does look like a shaving basin.
Oh, oh, yes.
Yes. It's a shaving basin.
I'm a barber. I was merely wearing this for my head... to... to ward off the rays of the sun, you see... so that's how your highship made the mistake of...
Silence!
Knowest thou what that really is?
Uh-uh.
The golden helmet of Mambrino.
When worn by one of noble heart... it rendereth him invulnerable to all wounds.
From what fallen knight didst thou steal it?
I didn't steal it.
- Surrender it!
- Well, it cost me half a crown!
Surrender it, or I'll split... -
I must say, Your Grace, it is worth half a crown.
Peasant.
Thou golden helmet of Mambrino
With so illustrious a past
Too long hast thou been lost to glory
But rediscovered now at last
Golden helmet of Mambrino
There can be no helm like thee
Thou and I now
Ere I die now
Will make golden history
I can hear the cuckoo singing
In the cuckoo berry tree
If he says that that's a helmet
I suggest that you agree
But he'll find it is not golden
Will not make him bold and brave
Well, at least he'll find it useful
If he ever needs a shave
Golden helmet
Of Mambrino
There can be no
Helm like thee
Thou and I now
Ere I die now
Will make golden
History
Are you saying your prayers?
I thought you'd like some refreshment, then supper.
- Sir Castellano.
- Sir Knight.
I would make a confession.
To me?
I would confess
I have never been dubbed knight.
Oh. That's bad.
But I am well qualified, milord.
I am brave and courteous, bold and generous... affable and patient.
Yes. That's the list.
Therefore
I would beg a boon of thee.
Anything... within reason.
Tonight, I will hold vigil in the chapel of thy castle... and, at dawn, receive from your hand... the ennobling stroke of knighthood.
But there's one small difficulty... no chapel.
- No chapel?
- That is, it's being restored.
Now, if you wouldn't mind... holding your vigil some other place?
Here in the courtyard... under the stars.
Of course. At dawn, you shall be dubbed knight.
Milord...
I thank you.
Now will you have some supper?
Before a vigil? Nay, milord.
On this night, I must fast and compose my spirit.
We have come for Don Quixote,
Knight of La Mancha.
We have word he stays at this inn.
Yes, Your Grace, he does stay here.
My sister, this great lady would speak with him.
The drums sound!
Why am I summoned?
Are you the man we seek?
I am Don Quixote, de La Mancha.
Fire cannot be hidden.
Virtue cannot fail to be recognized.
Cease your praises.
Word of your renown met us on the very shores of Spain.
You have no need to sue for favor.
Only say how I may help you.
Milady, you must not kneel.
I shall not rise until you grant the boon I ask.
I grant it freely.
The Great Enchanter has brought unhappiness to us all.
Your enemy.
He has bewitched our brother.
Turned him to stone.
He will not regain his former self... until Don Quixote joins in single combat... with the Enchanter.
Have the fates indeed reserved... this unparalleled adventure for my sword?
Assist me, sweet Dulcinea.
Let not your favor and protection... fail me in this, my first trial.
Where shall I find the Enchanter?
Declare yourself, and he will find you.
Pray well, Don Quixote.
Pray power into thine arm, a keen edge to thy sword... and courage into thy soul.
I shall take my prayers up in the chapel.
Here is my arm.
Is this the lady Dulcinea?
The gentleman's talking to you.
- Ah!
- Dulcinea.
Her name's Aldonza.
The old gentleman, he took a fancy to calling her Dulcinea.
Where's this chapel?
How does it happen a wretched tavern like this... can boast a chapel?
It isn't a chapel, Your Grace.
He's in the stable.
Ah, another excess of imagination.
How does it harm anyone?
You're more of a fool than he is... playing tricks on a man who is mad. Leave me!
One might say Jesus was mad... or St. Francis.
A man who chooses to be mad can also choose to be sane.
Oh, yes. It was easy enough planning this enterprise... but it will be difficult to come out of it well.
May not the cure be more cruel than the disease?
We have given reality to his madness.
We cannot abandon him now.
We have said he will meet the Enchanter.
He must meet him.
Little bird, little bird
Awoo!
In the cinnamon tree
In the cinnamon tree
Little bird, little bird
Do you sing for me?
Do you bring me word
Of one I know?
Little bird, little bird
I love her so
Little bird, little bird
And I have to know
Little bird, little bird
Beneath this tree
This cinnamon tree
We learned to love
We learned to cry
For here we met
And here we kissed
And here one cold and moonless night
We said good-bye
Little bird, little bird
Little bird, little bird
Oh, have pity on me
Little bird, little bird
Bring her back to me now
Little bird, little bird
Beneath the cinnamon tree
Little bird, little bird
I have waited too long
Little bird
Without a song
- Little bird,
- Little bird, little bird
Please fly, please go
Little bird, little bird
And tell her so
Little bird, little bird
Little bird, little bird
- Sss!
- Awoo!
I spit on all your little birds!
Here!
Give it back!
Give it back to me!
What's this?
- "The most lovely sovereign...
- Oh!
"And high-born lady..."
It's from her knight!
It's a love letter.
- Such fine words.
- Well, fine words!
All right.
He's a man, isn't he?
He wants what every other man wants. So!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Hey... soon?
When I'm through in the kitchen.
Now I must consider how sages of the future... will describe this historic night.
Long after the sun had retired to his couch... darkening the gates and balconies of La Mancha...
Don Quixote, with lofty expression and measured tread... held vigil in the courtyard of a mighty castle.
Ohh.
Maker of empty boasts... on this of all nights to give way to vanity.
No. Don Quixote, take a deep breath of life... and consider how it should be lived.
Call nothing thine except thy soul.
Love not what thou art, only what thou may become.
Do not pursue pleasure... or thou mayest have the misfortune to overtake it.
Look always forward.
In last year's nests... there are no birds this year.
Be just to all men, courteous to all women.
Live in the vision... of the one for whom great deeds are done...
Dulcinea.
Get up from there! Get up!
Milady.
Why do you call me by that name?
- Because it is yours.
- My name is Aldonza!
I know you, milady.
I think you know me not.
All my years I have known you, your nobility of spirit... long have I seen you in my heart.
Your heart doesn't know much about women.
It knows all, milady.
Woman is the soul of man... the radiance that lights his way.
Woman is glory.
What do you want of me?
- Nothing.
- Liar.
I deserve the rebuke.
- I ask of milady...
- Now we get to it!
That I may be allowed to serve her... that I may hold her in my heart... that to her
I may dedicate each victory... and call upon her in defeat.
And if at last I give my life...
I give it in the sacred name of Dulcinea.
I must go. Pedro is waiting.
Why do you do these things?
What things?
These ridiculous... the things you do.
I come in a world of iron... to make a world of gold.
The world's a dung heap... and we are maggots that crawl on it.
No.
Milady knows better in her heart.
What's in my heart will get me halfway to hell... and you, Señor Don Quixote... your head is going to end up a stranger to your neck.
- That doesn't matter.
- What does?
Only that I follow the quest.
That for your quest.
What does it mean... quest?
The mission of each true knight is duty... nay, is privilege.
To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go
To right the unrightable wrong
To love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star
This is my quest
To follow that star
No matter how hopeless
No matter how far
To fight for the right
Without question or pause
To be willing to march into hell
For a heavenly cause
And I know if I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest
And the world will be better for this
That one man scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach
The unreachable star
Once, just once, would you look at me as I really am?
I see beauty, purity.
Dulcinea.
You!
You keep me waiting, would you?
- I wasn't. I didn't mean to...
- Milady!
My little flower!
Monster!
Stay clear!
Thou wouldst strike a woman?
Ah, stand back, or I'll break your head.
Thou heart of flint and bowels of cork.
I'm killed.
Jose! Tenorio!
Jose! Tenorio!
- Pedro!
- Anselmo! Jose!
Muleteers!
Anselmo!
Tenorio! Anselmo! Muleteers!
Hold thou!
Heed the knocking of thy craven knees!
Prepare to do battle!
Come one! Come all!
Come what may come!
Here am I!
Let him be.
He's worth a thousand of you!
Ahh, back, whore!
I'll show you!
Sancho!
Hold on, Your Grace!
Sancho!
Coming, Master!
Look out, Tenorio!
Help me! Help me! Help me!
Look out, Master! Look out!
Victory.
- Victory?
- Victory?
- Victory.
- Victory!
- Victory?
- Victory.
Victory! Victory!
What's this? All the noise?
What's this? All the noise?
- What dreadful thing?
- What glorious thing!
Don Castellano...
I would inform you right has triumphed!
Your Grace, are you hurt?
No, no.
A little weakness... temporary.
Your Grace!
Bring water! Water, quick!
Oh, crusader.
Your Grace. Your Grace?
- He's coming round.
- Oh.
Oh, that I might always wake unto such a vision.
Don't move.
I must say, Your Grace, we certainly did a job out here.
We routed them.
That bunch will be walking bow-legged for a week.
Milady, it is not seemly to gloat over the fallen.
Let them rot in hell!
Sir, I am a tame and peaceful man.
Please, Sir Knight, I do not wish to be inhospitable... but I must ask you to leave as soon as you're able.
I am sorry to have offended the dignity of your castle... and at daylight,
I shall depart... but first, may I remind you of your promise?
Promise?
True, it is not yet dawn... but I have kept vigil and proven myself in combat.
I therefore beg you, dub me knight.
Oh, certainly.
Let's get it over with.
Sancho, would you be good enough to fetch my sword?
Yes, Your Grace.
I cannot speak, milady... how joyful I am that this ceremony should take place... in your presence.
Be careful, now.
It is the solemn moment that seals my vocation.
- Are you ready?
- I am.
Very well, then. Kneel.
Don Quixote de La Mancha...
I hereby dub thee knight.
My Lord.
Didn't I do it right?
If your lordship could make some mention... of the deeds I've performed to deserve this honor...
Oh, of course.
Don Quixote de La Mancha... having proved yourself this day... in glorious and terrible combat... and by my authority as lord of this castle...
I hereby dub thee knight.
My Lord...
Something else?
If your lordship recalls... it is the custom to grant the new knight... an additional name.
If your lordship could devise such a name...
Uh, let me see.
Hail, Knight
Of the Woeful Countenance
Knight of the Woeful Countenance
Wherever you go
People will know
Of the glorious deeds
Of the Knight of the Woeful Countenance
Farewell and good cheer
Oh, my brave cavalier
Ride onward to glorious strife
I swear when you're gone
I'll remember you well
For all of the rest of my life
Hail, Knight of the Woeful Countenance
Knight of the Woeful Countenance
Wherever you go
Face to the foe
They will quail at the sight
Of the Knight of the Woeful Countenance
Oh, valorous knight
Go and fight for the right
And battle the villains that be
But, oh, when you do
What will happen to you?
Thank God
I won't be there to see
Hail, Knight
- Of the Woeful Countenance
- Hail, Knight
- Of the Woeful Countenance
- Hail, Knight
Of the Woeful Countenance
Hail, Knight
Hail, Knight of the Woeful Countenance
Knight of the Woeful Countenance
Wherever you go
People will know
Of the glorious deeds
Of the Knight of the Woeful
Countenance
I thank you.
Well, Sir Knight,
I am going to bed.
And I advise you to do the same.
Knight of the Woeful Countenance.
It's a beautiful name.
Come, Your Grace.
Let's get you to bed.
Not yet, Sancho.
I owe something to my enemies.
- That account's been paid.
- Not yet, milady.
- What?
- Nobility demands.
It does?
Yes.
Therefore I will go to them.
I'll go. I'll minister.
There is no need.
They were my enemies, too.
Oh, blessed one.
Come, Your Grace.
Let's get you to bed.
Sancho, I do envy my enemies.
Your Grace, you're tired.
No, Sancho, I feel quite well.
Your Grace, many a man... has gone to bed in the evening feeling well... only to wake up in the morning and find himself dead.
- That's a proverb.
- Yes, Your Grace.
- I don't approve of them.
- I know, Your Grace.
What in hell do you think you're doing?
I'm going to minister to your wounds.
- You're what?
- Nobility demands.
Turn over, you foxy goat!
You...
Sons of whores!
Let me out!
No!
Bastards!
Bastards! Bastards!
Bastards!
Ow! Bastards!
Bastards!
Let me go!
Let me go!
No!
Enough!
Load up. We're leaving.
What do we do with this?
We'll take it along.
Let these events be proof to thee, my Sancho.
Nobility triumphs.
Virtue will always prevail.
Oh, yes, Your Grace.
Now, in this moment of glory... do I confirm my knighthood and my oath.
For all my life, this I do swear.
To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go
What is that?
One of the hazards of this prison... the brave men of the Inquisition!
It means they're coming to fetch someone.
Haul him off, put the question to him.
Next thing he knows, he is dead.
They're coming for me very possibly.
What, Cervantes, not afraid?
Where's your courage?
Or is that in your imagination, too?
No escape. This is happening.
Not to your brave man of La Mancha, but to you.
Quick, Cervantes, call on him.
Let him shield you.
Let him save you, if he can... from that.
No! No! No! No!
Well, not this time.
But you see, Cervantes, there is a difference... between reality and illusion... and a difference between these prisoners... and your men of lunacy.
I'd say rather men whose illusions were very real.
Much the same thing, isn't it, really?
Why are you poets so fascinated with madmen?
We have much in common.
You both turn your backs on life?
We both select from life!
A man has to come to terms with life as it is.
Life as it is.
I have lived for over forty years, and I've seen... life as it is.
Pain... misery... cruelty beyond belief.
I've heard all the voices of God's noblest creature.
Moans from bundles of filth in the street.
I've been a soldier and a slave.
I've seen my comrades fall in battle... or die more slowly under the lash in Africa.
I've held them at the last moment.
These were men who saw life as it is.
Yet they died despairing.
No glory, no brave last words.
Only their eyes, filled with confusion... questioning why.
I do not think they were asking why they were dying... but why they had ever lived.
When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies?
Perhaps to be too practical is madness.
To surrender dreams, this may be madness.
To seek treasure where there is only trash... too much sanity may be madness!
And maddest of all... to see life as it is and not as it should be!
I am I, Don Quixote
The Lord of La Mancha
Destroyer of evil am I
I will march to the sound
Of the trumpets of glory
Forever to conquer or die
I don't understand.
Don't understand what, my friend?
Why you're so cheerful.
First you find your lady, then you lose her.
Never lost.
Well, she ran off with those muleteers.
Doubtless for some high purpose.
High purpose with those low characters?
Sancho, always thine eye sees evil in preference to good.
My eye did not make this world.
It only sees it.
Right, and furthermore,
I think you should call a truce.
What, and allow wickedness to flourish?
I've noticed wickedness wears pretty thick armor.
And for that would you have me cease?
Nay, let a man be struck down a thousand times!
- Still must he rise and...
- Do battle, yes.
Lies, lies, lies!
Madness and lies!
Lies, lies, lies!
Madness and lies!
They shall be punished, who did this crime.
Crime?
You know the worst crime of all? Being born.
For that you get punished your whole life.
- Dulcinea.
- Enough of that!
Get yourself to a madhouse!
Rave about nobility where no one can hear.
- Milady.
- I'm not your lady!
I'm not any kind of a lady.
For a lady has modest and maidenly airs
And a virtue a blind man could see that I lack
It's hard to develop
These maidenly airs
In a stable, laid flat on your back
Won't you look at me, look at me
God, won't you look at me?
Look at the kitchen slut
Reeking of sweat
Born on a dung heap
To die on a dung heap
A strumpet men use and forget
If you feel that you see me
Not quite at my virginal best
Cross my palm with a coin
And I'll willingly show you the rest
Never deny that you are Dulcinea.
Take the clouds from your eyes and see me as I really am!
You have shown me the sky
But what good is the sky
To a creature who'll never do better than crawl?
Of all the cruel bastards
Who've badgered and battered me
You are the cruelest of all
Can't you see what your gentle insanities do to me?
Rob me of anger and give me despair
Blows and abuse I can take
And give back again
Tenderness I cannot bear
So please torture me now
With your sweet Dulcineas no more
I am no one, I am nothing
I'm only Aldonza the whore
Now and forever you are milady, Dulcinea.
No!
Master.
Master!
Is this
Don Quixote de La Mancha?
If it is, and he is not afraid to look upon me... let him stand forth.
I am Don Quixote...
Knight of the Woeful Countenance.
Then hear me, thou charlatan.
Thou art no knight, but a foolish pretender.
Thy pretense is a child's mockery... and thy principles dirt beneath my feet.
False, graceless knight... before I chastise thee, tell me thy name.
Thou shalt hear it in due course.
And why seekest thou me?
Thou called upon me,
Don Quixote.
Thou reviled me and threatened me.
The Enchanter.
Behold at thy feet the gauge of battle.
On what terms do we fight?
Choose.
Very well. If thou art beaten, thy freedom is forfeit... and thou must obey my every command.
And thy conditions?
If thou livest... thou shalt kneel and beg forgiveness of milady, Dulcinea.
Ha!
Thy lady is an alley cat.
- Monster! Defend thyself!
- Halt.
Thou asked my name, Don Quixote.
Now I shall tell it.
I am called the Knight of the Mirrors.
Look, Don Quixote.
Look in the mirror of reality... and behold things as they truly are.
Look, Don Quixote.
Look in the mirror of reality.
Look!
What seest thou, Don Quixote?
A gallant knight?
Naught but an aging fool.
Look, dost thou see him?
A madman dressed for a masquerade.
A masquerade!
Look, Don Quixote.
See him as he truly is.
See the clown.
Look, what seest thou,
Don Quixote?
Look! Dost thou see him?
A madman! Look, Don Quixote!
See him as he truly is.
Look, Don Quixote.
Drown, Don Quixote.
Drown in the mirror.
Drown, Don Quixote.
Drown in the mirror.
Go deep. Deep. Deep.
Deep. Go deep. Deep.
The masquerade is ended.
Confess!
Thy lady is a trollop... and thy dream the nightmare of a disordered mind.
It is done.
Your Grace, it is Dr. Carrasco.
It is only Sanson Carrasco.
Forgive me, Señor Quijana.
It was the only way.
Don Miguel de Cervantes?
Who calls?
Don Miguel.
Cervantes! Cervantes!
Don Miguel de Cervantes!
Don Miguel de Cervantes!
Prepare to be summoned.
Summoned? By whom?
The judges of the Inquisition.
Captain? How long?
Soon.
But not yet. Good.
You'll just have time to finish your story.
The story is finished.
Of course.
Quite the proper ending.
No, no, no!
I don't like this ending!
And I don't think the jury likes it, either.
Well, then. He's failed.
Ah, Don Miguel de Cervantes.
The court hereby sentences you...
- Wait!
- What for?
- Time. I need time.
- I'll grant you that.
But, uh, what about the Inquisition?
A few moments only.
I'll improvise an ending.
A farmhouse on the plains of La Mancha.
Candle.
A room in that house.
When a man who once called himself Don Quixote... lies in the shadows between living and dying.
Can you do nothing?
I'm afraid there will be no need of my services as a doctor.
Where is he, I wonder?
In what dark cavern of the mind?
- According to recent theory...
- Oh, Doctor, please.
Don't you think I did right?
There's the contradiction.
You again!
- Tell him to go away.
- What harm can he do?
It's all been done.
Your reverence?
Could I talk to him?
I'm afraid he won't be able to hear you.
Well, then, I won't say much.
No mention of knight-errantry.
Oh, no. One does not speak of the rope... in the house of the hanged.
Proverb. Excuse me, Your Grace.
- Your Grace?
- Just a few words.
Little ones... to lighten his heart.
A little gossip
A little chat
A little idle talk of this and that
I'll tell him all the troubles I have had
And since he doesn't hear
At least he won't feel bad
Shh, shh.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, what a time
I've been having... since I got back, Your Grace.
You know my wife Teresa, how strong she is... muscles like a bull.
Well, she beat me.
She hit me with everything but the house itself.
And she yells at me...
"Where's all the gold and all the jewels...
"you were going to bring back?
"Where's that kingdom you were going to conquer?"
Well, I kept a dignified silence, Your Grace... because there are some questions you just can't answer.
Like when a man yells, "What are you doing with my wife?"
That's a question you just can't answer.
Of course, I hit her back,
Your Grace.
But she's a lot harder than I am... and as the saying goes...
"Whether the stone hits the pitcher...
"or the pitcher hits the stone...
"it's going to be bad for the pitcher."
So I've got bruises from here to...
Oh, I haven't fought a windmill in a fortnight
And the humble joys get duller every day
Why, when I'm asleep, a dragon with his fiery tongue a-waggin'
Whispers, Sancho, won't you please come out and play?
That's enough!
- What did I do?
- I warned you.
- I didn't do anything. I was...
- Please be quiet.
My friend?
Did Your Grace say something?
You are a fat pudding... stuffed with proverbs.
Oh, that's very well-known,
Your Grace.
Well, as I was saying...
- Uncle?
- My dear.
Good morning, Father.
Or is it evening?
How do you feel, sir?
I am but well.
Can you speak your name?
Should a man not know his name?
If you would just say it.
Alonso Quijana.
Father?
I am here, beside you.
I wish to make a will.
Yes.
Of course.
- Uncle?
- Forgive me.
L... When I close my eyes,
I see a pale horse... and I am bid mount him.
No, uncle, you will get well.
Oh, my dear master's worship, do not die... but live on many years.
Dying is such a waste of good health.
Soft and fair, my dear ones.
In last year's nests, there are no birds this year.
Come closer.
I have dreamed so strangely.
Oh, such dreams.
I... thought
I had declared myself a...
No, I dare not tell you, lest you think me mad.
- Put them from your mind.
- They are gone.
Nor do I know what they meant.
Father?
Just speak, and I shall write.
I, Alonso Quijana... with one foot in the stirrup... and all too ready for the final ride...
Don't admit anyone.
Do hereby make the following disposition of my estate.
The bulk I leave to my beloved niece Antonia Quijana... with the exception of certain personal bequests... which are as follows...
I will allow nobody into that room!
Get out of the way, you hag!
- What is that, Sanson?
- It's that slut from the inn.
I tried to stop her, and she threatened to...
Tear your eyes out if you touch me again, by God!
- Get out!
- Not before I see him!
Let her be.
In my house there will be courtesy!
Come closer, girl.
What is it you wish?
Don't you know me?
Should I?
I am Aldonza.
I'm so sorry. L... I don't recall anyone of that name.
Oh, please, My Lord.
Why do you say, "My Lord"?
You are My Lord, Don Quixote.
Don Quixote?
Forgive me.
I am confused by shadows.
It is possible I knew you once.
I do not remember.
This way.
Please try to remember.
Is it so important?
Everything.
My whole life.
You spoke to me.
And everything was... different.
I spoke to you?
And you looked at me... and you called me by another name.
Dulcinea.
Dulcinea
Once you found a girl
And called her
Dulcinea
When you spoke the name
An angel seemed to whisper
Dulcinea
Dulcinea
Then perhaps it was not a dream.
You spoke of a dream... and about the quest.
A quest?
How you must fight?
And it doesn't matter whether you win or lose... if only you follow the quest.
What did I say to you?
Tell me the words.
"To dream...
"the impossible dream."
But they are your own words.
"To fight...
"the unbeatable foe."
Don't you remember?
"To bear...
"with unbearable sorrow."
You must remember!
"To run...
"where the brave dare not go."
To right... the unrightable wrong.
Yes.
To love... pure and chaste from afar.
Yes.
To try when your arms are too weary.
To reach the unreachable star.
Thank you, My Lord.
Milady! This is not seemly.
On your knees to me?
- But, My Lord, you're not well.
- Not well?
What is sickness to the body of a knight-errant?
What matter wounds?
For each time he falls... he will rise again... and woe to the wicked!
- Sancho?
- Here, Your Grace!
- My armor, my sword!
- More misadventures!
Adventures, old friend!
Oh, the trumpets of glory
Now call me to rise
Yes, the trumpets are calling to me
And wherever I ride
Ever staunch at my side
My squire and my lady will be
I am I, Don Quixote
The Lord of La Mancha
Our destiny calls, and we go
And the wild winds of fortune
Will carry us onward
Whithersoever they blow
Whithersoever they blow
Onward to glory we go
Master!
- Master!
- Uncle!
Master.
My Lord.
De profundis clamo ad te
Domine
Domine
Audi vocem meam
Fiant aures tuae intentae
Ad vocem abse creationis meae
Si delictarum memorium
Serva neris
Domine
Domine...
He is dead.
My master is dead.
A man died.
He seemed a good man... but I did not know him.
But you saw.
Don Quixote's not dead.
Believe, Sancho.
Believe.
Aldonza...
Dulcinea.
Dulcinea.
Under authority of the Holy
Office of the Inquisition... by reason of certain offenses... committed against His Majesty's
Most Catholic Church... the following is summoned to give answer... and submit his person for purification... if it be so ordered...
Don Miguel de Cervantes.
I am a popular defendant.
Summoned before one court... before I've quite finished with another.
Well, what says this jury?
You know, I think I know now what this contains.
The history of your mad knight.
As much as is written.
Read as well there as you did here... and you may not burn.
I have no intention of burning.
Cervantes?
I think Don Quixote... is brother to Cervantes.
God help us.
We are both men of La Mancha.
For me alone was Don Quixote born... and I for him.
I give him to you.
Ready, old friend?
Courage.
To dream the impossible dream... to fight the unbeatable foe.
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go
To run where the brave dare not go
Though the goal be forever too far
To try though you're wayworn and weary
To reach the unreachable star
To reach the unreachable star
Though you know it's impossibly high
To live with your heart striving upward
To a far
Unattainable
Star
