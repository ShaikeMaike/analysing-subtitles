I remember when young D'Artagnan was made a Musketeer to the king.
Splendid ceremony, you know.
All the best people, creamed of French society.
I was there, off course.
Who but I, with Aramis and Athos could put the tabard on D'Artagnan shoulder?
It is important for a young man rising in the world... should be seen to have a worthy and well sponsored.
It gives people confidence.
And the king approved.
And the Queen, as well she might.
But was it not D'Artagnan, Aramis,
Athos and I would save her reputation.
And prevented her love affair with the Duke of Buckingham from scandal.
Stupid woman, you see, becoming infatuated... with an Englishman and an
English Prime Minister as well.
D'Artagnan... deserved his reward.
The four had risked our skin and reputation on her behalf... against perilous enemies.
The Cardinal Richelieu for one.
A formidable man and hungry for power.
Who would've exposed and ruined the Queen to serve his own ambition.
No gentleman, you see.
His agents were Milady de Winter and her lover, Rochefort, two birds of prey in fine feathers.
She would never forgive D'Artagnan... or his mistress Constance for defeating her plot against the Queen.
Revenge was what Milady wanted.
A dreadful woman.
But what did we care for her or Rochefort or Cardinal?
We were young and carefree, as Musketeers should be.
And D'Artagnan was in love with his dressmaker.
And there was work, fighting in service against the Protestants of La Rochelle.
We tried to teach the rebels the meaning of Christian charity, by bombarding them into surrender.
These thugs with the idea of a working class as a religion!
Even our old enemy Rochefort, the Cardinal's jackal blade... is spying for us inside the walls of La Rochelle.
Unsuccesfully, you see.
Fortunately for him, we three played our part, disdain is what I thought.
Rescue a spy, no gentleman. Leave him where he is, if I had my way.
- This is enough for him.
- We did not know how many.
Yes, you did.
Return your stick!
Put in bullets!
Shake the rod load!
Recover your muskets!
Light the wick!
Blow off your coal!
Cock your musket!
Has Porthos got the horses ready?
Yes.
Has he got the horses ready?
Yes!
Blindfold!
Place the muskets!
Perhaps I could close one eye.
Poise your muskets!
Now!
The bomb! Quickly!
Open the look!
The fuse, Athos! The fuse!
Present!
Fire!
Damn fools!
Can't you even shoot a man?
Reload!
Why bother?
I may died of old age.
Get on the horse, Rochefort!
Hurry!
- You arrive just in time!
- Who hurries to rescue a spy?
Seal off our escape!
The gate!
Yes, right.
Aramis!
Go under if you can!
Hit it now! Like that!
No, again! Again!
I'd rather die than have to bring you this news, Your Majesty.
The rebels would not surrender, they expect a fleet...
...to aid them under the Duke of Buckingham.
- I'd rather I die.
- I would rather.
We would all rather.
- I owe my life, Your Majesty.
- I don't want it!
I don't want those stories either.
I want to make a triumphant entry to La Rochelle.
- Duke of Buckingham covet my Queen.
- No, Sire.
He wants La Rochelle, he will assist the rebels.
But your Queen is not a traitor to France.
- Not to France. To me.
- But Your Majesty is France.
Tell the rabble which leaves not to storm La Rochelle.
Time will shatter those walls, Majesty.
La Rochelle will fall.
But it is boring, battling away day after day.
Sire,
Shall we siege on here while
Your Majesty returns to Paris... to your Queen, your faithfull Queen?
Leave this dirty business to us.
It is dirty business, and the
Queen is a traitor to my bed.
You should think yourself lucky.
I can place my musketeers in danger to help you out of there.
I shall not do it again, spy. If you have another eye, you might see why.
Good, I like that.
The gratitude of princes.
Spy? It is a foul word.
It is a familiar word to me,
Eminence, in your service.
To your knees, little man, before your master!
Now hear me, Rochefort.
The Queen sends letter of love to Buckingham. She should not.
Not while Buckingham sends fleet against France.
I would have you stop these letters, by stopping their girl between.
The woman Bonacieux,
Queen's dressmaker.
You will remove her, my son.
This time do not require me to rescue you.
She is, after all, only a woman.
I tell you, that goose is tender, sir.
See? Now, say you're sorry.
You don't want it.
My mother says that only well can you tell if fresh.
Peaches!
Are they not beautiful?
Beside you, Constance my dear, they look old and wrinkled.
Melons!
Clumsy clown.
Whose going to pay for them?
D'Artagnan?
D'Artagnan!
Away with her.
Stand up and fight, you coward!
Poor, poor gentleman.
Rene!
Come, lift him into to coach.
But, gently.
He's hurt.
But Constance...
Be still.
I should take care of you.
Really, Kitty. He's a most handsome young man.
- You are awake, sir?
- Who are you?
A friend.
Constance's melons!
- I have to go!
- You are being foolish.
I must find Constance.
Please forgive me.
Such kindness to a stranger.
Sir!
You are not well. Trully.
You should lie down.
Should.
No. But I will be back... to thank you properly.
A most handsome young man.
If he's bleeding lot of blood in the gutter, I'd have my way.
And you are a friend.
You know what he'd say if he knew we had his dressmaker under lock and key?
So much beauty wasted in a ridiculous musketeer.
I merely obey the Cardinal's orders and keep him occupied.
Isn't that all the Cardinal wants?
You do have a habit to enjoying your work.
What do you say, Lord Buckingham?
If God intended us to swim underwater, he would giving us fins.
If I go to break the siege of La
Rochelle, we shall go with ships.
Well...
This under sea boat of yours is an ingenious invention, but how many carts of salt beef can you carry to the rebels?
How many big guns can you take to blow old Richelieu to hell?
We're coming!
But this boat is big enough to steal the Queen of France.
I do not need to steal the Queen of France. / No.
When the time is ripe, we shall be together.
My dear sweet Anne...
Stupid priests!
Stupid Protestants!
Three weeks sneezing in the rain at La Rochelle, and for what?
The best of my wardrobe still on its way back to Paris.
These religious wars. Beatrice,
I could lose all patience!
- Perhaps, Majesty, this one...
- No!
That makes me like a burst cushion.
Constance will just have to make me a new one. Where is she?
- Where's the Queen's dressmaker?
- Constance is not to be found.
What do you mean?
She has not been seen for two days. Not here or home.
She has, gone.
The Cardinal.
Beatrice, what have they done with her?
But where? Where?
You say they kidnapped her under your nose? And only four of them?
Lose ones mistress in the conventional way is bad enough, but to have her carried off like a basket of washing... that's careless, almost bad taste!
Especially when one has paying attention to a beautiful, great Milady.
Your poor Madame Bonacieux would probably prefers to stay... with the kidnappers.
Mine mistresses would,
If I treated her so.
Aramis! Aramis!
Observe my new trick!
My opponent is there, about to unsheathe, when suddenly...
Oh, Porthos.
Try it again.
Only Porthos could invent a new way of disarming himself.
Will you never learn?
Kidnap her? Why?
Not even listening.
- It was a scientific experiment!
- Athos, are you hurt?
What I am is drunk.
What you are, sir, troubled.
Child, you are troubled.
What's the matter?
It's my mistress. She was snatched from my side... / Good.
Has you discovered their hiding place?
- No.
- Good!
I am told that you have found another. / No!
Porthos told me.
Now, is Porthos a liar?
No.
He speaks to me of a certain milady who lead you by the hand.
No, no, no!
I love her with my head.
But my Constance, snatched from my side, I love with my heart.
You have a conveniently discriminating anatomy.
Who would've thought you kept your heart swung there so you might lose it?
Why, you shriveled old winesack!
Have you never lost your heart?
Me? No.
Never. But I knew a man once who did. But me, never.
Hear this love story.
There was this man.
This noble man... who lost his heart. He loved a girl who came from nothing. came with beauty as beautiful as, whatever you think is beautiful.
And he was a great man.
Without fear, he taken her.
But he was a great man because he was a man of honor. So he married her.
Knowing not whence she came.
He gave her his name, as well his love...
...with honor.
One day, hunting, she was trip from the horse.
And there in the full light of day... he saw her naked shoulder.
He saw the branded mark of harlot.
A thief, placed there.
His angel bore his name and the mark of dishonor together.
Whore, murderers or worst burned into her shoulder.
He... saw it.
He...
What?
I think that she is...
...dead.
I would hope she died, wouldn't you?
Poor man.
Poor dishonored man.
Well!
That's the story to cure your love.
It takes a love story to cure you of love.
Of fascinating women.
Tell me something. Is your
Milady as beautiful as the dew?
She's as magnificent as summer's dew. As that.
I'd beg of you, forget her, she will do you some mischief.
Yes, you're right. And besides,
I owe it to my Constance.
I shall remain faithful to her.
- Monsieur D'Artagnan!
- Kitty! Your mistress is well today?
- Well indeed, sir, but not here.
- Not here? But she said four o'clock.
Yes, but before four she went out, to take the air. / The air?
Why would she do that?
What a pretty flower!
She doesn't love you at all.
She told you that?
Oh, no. But, I have seen
Milady and men before.
But why do you tell me this?
- Because I have my own interest.
- You? You, Kitty?
But of course, what else could one expect?
Dear child.
Now then, we have ten minutes before Milady return.
We're here.
Thank you, Milady.
Bloody arm.
Kitty?
- She has put a weight on.
- Why didn't she get a horse?
Kitty?
Kitty!
- Were you asleep?
- I was resting.
Thank you.
- Has our Gascon been and gone?
- No, Milady.
He did not come.
Perhaps with the army going to La
Rochelle, he's been detained by duty.
Possibly. It maybe necesarry to teach Monsieur D'Artagnan manners, before we've done with him.
- What will you do with him, Milady?
- Who should say?
It was pleasant to be adore by one so pretty.
In time, Rochefort will cut him to death by inches.
Perhaps I should watch.
As for his dressmaker...
Rochefort grooms will have her.
I should wear this tonight.
Stay there!
Thank you!
No...
Where is Constance Bonacieux?
Quickly! Unless you want this bed to be your deathbed. Where is she? / Wait.
Try that again and I'll cut some fleur de lis and the rest of you!
- Quickly, Kitty! Give me that cloak!
- Kitty! Open the door!
But...
Excuse me, sir.
Stop! Come back, sir!
Kitty opens the door!
I think your mistress is calling.
But that's the window...
Hello, hello.
Hey.
- Thank you, Madame.
- Move along, please.
Kitty!
Oh, well.
Kitty! Open the door!
Bad luck, Aramis!
Shoe shine! Anyone wants shoes shine, sir?
Shoe shine?
- D'Artagnan! Lend me some money!
- Wine!
I need some wine!
Ah, thank you.
Where did you get this?
Milady.
Your story, the brand of fleur de lis...
It was her?
Oh God.
I'd hoped that she was dead.
This has been in our family for generations before I gave it to her.
Those other two must not know, alright? / Yes.
So she has return to haunt me.
And you.
Because you've done something she'll never forgive. You found out her secret.
She won't let you live, boy.
She has tried in that line already.
Leave now.
Leave Paris, leave France. Get as far from that evil woman's grasp as you can.
How about you?
I'm safe. She does not know that Athos exist.
If you stay, your life will be worthless. Do you understand?
No. You forget, there's still Constance to be found.
That tumbling trot of a dressmaker?
If you please! I love her.
I think.
I shall ask the Queen for help in finding her.
And as for the branded lady and her vengeance:
Our regiment leaves again for La Rochelle tomorrow. That's far enough to be safe.
- Where away, musketeer?
- The Queen.
Her Majesty isn't receiving, but the Cardinal is.
D'Artagnan of Gascony.
You'd been describe as a swordsman.
That is kindness.
- As an intriguer.
- There's that, in all of us.
- As an enemy.
- I'm honored to have you as an enemy.
I?
I have no enemies.
Only those in France.
But I do seem to be continually beset by enemies who wear your coat.
You wear my coat.
Serve France, as I do.
I'm offering you a commissioned in my guard.
These enemies are the enemies of France.
Root them out under my protection.
Wear my coat. Have my love.
Eminence, what can I say?
"Yes" will be sufficient.
I can't.
You're very wet.
Wet or dry, I cannot.
Take my hand. Your fortune is secured. / No, I can't!
I do not withdraw my hand.
It is held out to you openly.
In it lies your future.
Take it.
No.
Are you going to the siege of La Rochelle? / I do.
You will find it a perilous journey.
I bear you no ill will,
- But I can give you no protection.
- I asked for none.
I shall not lift a finger to save you.
I deeply regret that I can not accept your service.
I don't make such an offer twice in one day.
But if you should survive to return to Paris, you may see my hand stretched out to you once more.
For then, you would be a very remarkable young man indeed.
I would remark on it to people.
Goodbye.
The young fool refused Richelieu offer of a commissioned.
Which now makes him fair game as far as your concern.
He's conceit.
No!
We should oblige D'Artagnan & make sure that his journey is an eventful one.
That's easily arrange.
The Musketeers regiment leave Paris tomorrow.
They serve as couriers on their march to La Rochelle.
D'Artagnan and his friends frequently travel in small groups.
There should be no difficulty to entertain them along the road.
Excelent. And the woman, Bonacieux?
The lady is enjoying the hospitality of my guards at my chateau Saint-Cloud.
It would seem they are most anxious to pander... to her creature comfort.
So she is in safe hands.
Never fear.
The Queen will need a new dressmaker whenever you agree to say so.
At Saint-Cloud?
I know he'll kill her, if Milady says so.
And she'll do anything to bill revenge on you.
I'll have her out of here this night.
- But where can I take her to safety?
- To the convent of Armentières.
But Rochefort's men are sure to be expecting you.
Let us rescue your mistress. It's the very least one can do for a friend.
If she can stay with the Sisters while we're at La Rochelle...
I'm sure they'll learn a great deal from each other.
I'll cover for you and we will meet again within three days.
See if you can find a way to console yourself until our return.
Aramis!
Forgive me!
Don't let him get the key!
Do not let him get it!
We need it!
Go to the window!
Hello, my dear. Would you like to climb on my shoulders?
There he is!
Come on, my dear.
Quickly, here we are.
- Yes!
- Sister. Be good.
The problems of the siege of
La Rochelle has been immense.
Mainly because nobody would listen to me.
For example:
I should deploy the siege towers at dawn.
No, no. Before dawn.
Good evening. See any musketeers yet? / Not yet.
There's a parcel of letter for you on the table. They came today.
Unfortunately, my superiors... do not appreciate my strategy.
Love, your...
What's it say?
This writing is bound to be indistinct. Perhaps you could...
"Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Monsieur Athos, Porthos and Aramis... arrived at my inn. "
It's from the innkeeper of Villoix.
"And having dine & drunk, became noisy, the marshal lock them up for a few days.
They asked me to send you a dozen bottle of my Anjou wine to drink their health. "
Now, that's what I call real friendship.
To think of me when they're drunk.
No. The least I can do is to bail them out, and we drink these together.
What did I do?
Who the devil would fight out of door in this weather?
- Only a lunatic.
- D'Artagnan might be involved?
Anyone else on this road?
That one.
And there.
Don't worry. I'm coming. I help...
- Take me with you!
- Out of my way!
Help me!
Are you hurt?
- No, no.
- Good, come along.
Aramis, this one is still alive.
We'll take him with us.
He can sing us a song about
Milady's plot, no doubt.
What about me?
I might've freeze!
- What do you think?
- Nothing.
We were supposed to go to Red
Dovecote inn near La Rochelle.
Oh, God, my arm!
I know nothing more, I swear! No names!
Planchet!
- Brandy!
- Come on, now! Bustle!
Here's your wine of Anjou.
That will do.
A drink, in the name of God. A drink.
Am I to die of thirst and cold while this footpad cuddle?
- What? Are you mad?
- Look!
I always had my doubts about the Anjou '22.
- Where did this wine come from?
- Why, you sent them!
It came today with a note from the landlord of Villoix.
- We sent you no wine.
- But we can guess who did.
An ambush on the road.
Poisoned wine.
It occurs to me that
Milady is tenacious.
The sooner we get to the field
Battle of La Rochelle, the better.
Red Dovecote inn.
- I think they're disgusting.
- Do try one, Majesty.
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost.
Look down on these sinners hanging.
Cardinal!
- La Rochelle has fallen, eh?
- Not quite, Sire.
The pigeon has reach the Dovecote, Eminence.
Eminence!
Yes, it's here.
Either your priestly intention above all the saint on your side, or you're cheating.
- It is a matter of faith.
- Your faith is costing me money.
All this evening spend at this place, just because a rascal mention its name.
What are we waiting?
Richelieu!
What the devil does he want here?
- No one knows you're here?
- The landlord has been well paid.
Yes. How, Milady.
What you will do for your pay:
A ship waiting at the river mouth.
You will board it tonight. In London... you will urge the Duke of Buckingham not to assist the rebels.
No food, no aid, no
English fleet to the rescue.
Assure him from me, that if he does, he is at war with France, a war he dare not fight, can not win.
More than that,
The Queen of France, for whom he bears love... my word on this, as sure as I love, will be dragged out and paraded in dishonor.
And if he will not heed you?
Then we must pray that the
Duke mixed with an accident.
I see.
Naturally, you will urge him to see wisdom.
Bon voyage, Milady.
I'm not to be paid in money.
You are not?
I have affairs to be settled.
I'm not concerned with your affairs.
I would wish it.
I'm not concerned with your wishes, Milady.
But you may name your own price, obviously.
A death.
I will not assist in your private murders.
I need no assistance.
I need only your signature that I might have carte blanche, a signed warrant... for disposal of the life of the slut Bonacieux and her lover.
No.
Eminence.
The death of Buckingham for the death of D'Artagnan. Their lives... for the sake of France.
- Well?
- Find D'Artagnan and stay with him.
And you?
- I'll follow as soon as I can.
- Be careful.
What do you want? Who are you?
How dare you?
The Gascon was right.
You're still beautiful.
Comte de la Fere!
Oh, no, milady.
The Comte de la Fere has died.
You killed me years ago.
Do you remember?
Hunting in the field.
On a summer's day.
I'm so stigmatized like you.
What do you want of me?
There's nothing between us.
Thank God.
But there might be, you see.
I know you.
I know what past here, just now.
And you mark this.
You kill Buckingham or have him killed, it's no matter to me.
He's an Englishman and an enemy.
But you touch one hair of D'Artagnan's head... and I swear, as God is my judge, I'll break you on the wheel with my own hand.
No.
Monsieur D'Artagnan... has assaulted me, insulted me...
Since when has it been possible to insult you, Madame?
And he will die for it.
Have you ever seen a woman shot in the stomach?
You know me, Milady.
Give me the papers the
Cardinal wrote just now.
I'll give you five seconds.
Very well.
One, two, three, four...
"By my order and for the good of the state, the bearer has done what has been done. Richelieu. "
Clever and subtle man, our dear Cardinal.
It gives you what you want without leaving evidence against himself.
Unfortunately you won't have time to send messages before your ship leaves.
Bon voyage.
The outer bastion is cleared of rebels.
But it's to hot to hold.
Fairly seven o'clock.
We'll try a full frontal assault at nine. Or at ten.
- A musketeer! Where have you been?
- Good day, gentlemen.
Boy! Quickly!
- Look here!
- Get off!
Thank you very much.
Where is the Gascon?
We have to speak to him, quickly.
Over there, in the trenches.
A conference? But where?
We can't keep a secret here.
The eyes and ears around here belongs to the Cardinal.
Right. Where can we go?
More work, gentlemen.
And where were the musketeers?
At our prayes, sir.
Like good christians.
So as I, and for a good reason.
That bastion was buzzing like a beehive.
And yet, you did not stay for to breakfast.
Neither would you.
Would you bet on that?
I'll wager you... the finest dinner on this camp, we will have breakfast on that bastion... now.
Done! Done!
You hear that, Spengler. We're going to eat that big dinner alone. /What is it?
Our good friend Athos, proposed to have us killed for breakfast. Up there.
Planchet! Bring bread, four chickens, ham, oysters and wine. Right now!
And make the wine champagne.
For breakfast? Oh, my dear Porthos!
- Planchet! Money, money, money...
- You can't afford some!
- Thistles!
- A long way to go for breakfast!
Is not that right, Athos?
Over there! Don't you see? Someone approaches the bastion! Fire!
Hurry! I'll cover you! Quick!
There!
Take cover, Planchet!
All right?
Why do we always have to attack uphill?
I'm getting too old for this.
I got something important to tell you! / You have to speak up!
You three up there!
Get those things ready!
At last, we got the cance to talk in peace.
Here is your wine, now.
It's an ideal temperature.
Come on. Open it, Planchet!
Damned pirate landlord!
This isn't champagne!
This wine does not travel well.
You saw her with the Cardinal?
And she's going to murder Buckingham?
If necessary. And knowing Buckingham, it probably will be. Give me some!
A moment, gentlemen!
We're in the middle of our breakfast!
Barbarians, have they no manners?
We can't allow Buckingham to be butchered! / Why? He is on their side.
Precisely. And he's English!
No! He's a gallant gentleman.
And he loves our Queen.
I won't sit by and allow him to be murdered by that...
She also has a death warrant signed against you and Madame Bonacieux.
Here, read this with your breakfast and tuck it safely in your boot.
Fire!
Wrong.
It would be better to wringing Milady than shooting these devils Protestants.
What are we killing them for? Because they sing psalms in French & we in Latin?
Porthos, have you no education? What do you think religious wars are all about?
Here they come!
Make your shot count!
Hurry up, Planchet.
Load that.
Come on, Planchet.
Use both hands.
A loaf of bread!
Mine!
What a waste!
I do apologize.
Quick, here! The wall!
Push! Push for your lives!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Push, Porthos! Exert yourself!
Athos! About Buckingham, I ought to warn the Queen! / Later!
Gentlemen, I suggest we get out of here!
Take!
Thank you very much, sir.
Could you give me a hand?
Can you help?
The basket.
Can you?
Take for it!
Come back soon. Don't get killed.
Come back and pay it, or we will find you.
Nice to see them back again.
Here we are. / Well done,
D'Artagnan. And Athos, come.
It know it against our principles, but have a drink!
And Aramis! Even you. Well done.
Here's your money. Now go and fill your fat royalist belly.
Your journey has been in vain.
Inform His Eminence, I'm not to be persuaded by his threats or beauty.
I will take English ships to help the Protestants of La Rochelle.
Tell the Cardinal.
I trust you do not live to regret it, Milord Buckingham.
Trust to the Cardinal to employ every diplomatic argument.
At least it relieves my conscience of any doubts in assisting the rebels.
I shall inform His Eminence.
Lady, you'll inform no one!
You came here as an ambassadress, but by God, you'll stay here as an assassin!
- You will not dare.
- Oh, no?
A week lodging in a congenial riverside establishment. The tower.
And after I've sails with my fleet to France, you will set sails to.
To His Majesty's colony in America.
America!
They say it is full of beautiful savages.
Who knows, once there, maybe you'll be able to use that... astonishing beauty to persuade someone to bring you home again.
But don't count on it, in the meantime.
I have a jailer for you who can't see beauty even when it is astonished you.
He can't be melted. Felton!
Milord?
Milady is going to the tower, Felton.
At your charge.
She is to see no one else.
Good sir?
In this place, may I be granted the comfort of Gods words?
A Bible. And the Psalms.
Are you not a Roman?
No.
No, sir.
I am a Huguenot. Those were prosecuted for their Protestant's faith.
This is mine.
I sall bring you the Psalms tomorrow.
God bless you, sir!
The Cardinal sent that woman to England...
...to kill?
Oh, no.
He must be warn!
- You go, D'Artagnan!
- It not possible, Your Majesty.
I can not leave my regiment with the Cardinal's spies are everywhere.
But I have a servant to go and warn
Buckingham, if you write a message.
- I owe you so much, D'Artagnan.
- No, Majesty.
Majesty, the King is waiting!
One glad piece of news, I do have.
Constance Bonacieux is safe.
She is at the Cecilia convent, near Armentieres.
As soon as I'm free of the siege,
I'll go and bring her back to Paris.
Madame, the King!
Save him for me.
God bless you, D'Artagnan.
And please have your servant hurry... to England.
This is the best I could get for the money.
Do not let your foot be moved; or numb the...
Lord is your protector;
The Lord is thy shade upon thy right...
The sun shall not smite you by day, nor the moon by night.
Lord shall preserve thee from all evil;
He saved your life.
Jehovah preserve thy going out and thy coming...
...now and forever.
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?
My help cometh from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
Do not allow your foot nor slumber that keepeth thee...
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?
My help cometh from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
Lift my eyes unto the hills:
Where does my help come from?
My help cometh from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
...nor he that keepeth thee slumber.
Behold, he is numb...
Lord shall preserve thee from all evil;
He saved your life.
When they cry, the Lord hear it... and delivers them from all their troubles.
The Lord is near...
Amen.
Master Felton.
For two nights I do not sleep.
When I am awake, I am nearer to God.
God is with thee, awake or asleep, Milady.
Help me!
God, help me! Help my people from prosecution!
Deliver them from the betrayal, the antichrist, so as not to corrupt and destroy.. as he has defiled and destroyed me.
Send me thy angel, God... to strike down Thy enemies!
Help me! Help me!
Who is the antichrist, the betrayal?
Your master, the Duke of Buckingham.
He is the Philistine blight on Israel.
You are a Puritan and yet, you serve him.
They are dying in La Rochelle for the faith and he is betraying them. / No!
- No! He's going to save them.
- He deceives the world & will betray.
He marches to Paris, to the bed of his Queen, his lascivious Roman Queen.
Help me, master Felton.
You have the eyes of a saint.
Help me to warn our people.
I can not think.
Help me.
Felton, you will not let this treachery go unpunished.
It is in God's hands.
His will be done. / Yes.
Let it be done.
Then the dragon was wroth with the women; and went to make war with the remnant of her seed.
Aye, ten pence.
Good steel, too.
Your change, sir!
Lord Buckingham!
Seems that Lord Buckingham not going to leave England.
My congratulations.
I reek of England and Calvinism.
The Cardinal's business is done.
I may devote myself to my own.
To St. Cloud and the woman, Bonacieux.
No. She is in the Cecilia convent in Armentieres.
One of my men went after her but the fool bungle it, somewhat.
Sorry.
And D'Artagnan? / La Rochelle surrendered three days ago.
So, Sire, La Rochelle has fallen.
And not before time.
- What you going to spend, Porthos?
- After paying the drink... for Athos and Aramis pardons, will not be too much.
Don't forget the needy.
Come on. Constance is in danger!
They were on the road to
Armentières to claim his lady love.
Don't worry, they can not possibly be closer than Paris by now.
We may be in Armentières at dawn.
I've twelve men at the convent already... so we can assure D'Artagnan a most heartly welcome.
And you will have them all, Milady.
Welcome, welcome, Musketeers!
These poor beasts are done, Athos.
Not only the poor beasts.
How far is the Cecilia convent? / Two miles!
Up the Brussels road.
We're almost there.
Time for a glass of wine!
Then we'll escort you to your heart desire. Wine! Come on!
To quench a Gascon.
Hey, stop!
Quickly!
Athos!
Athos! He's here!
Rochefort! He saw me! Come on!
After him!
Come on! Quick!
After them!
After them! Quick!
There's no saddle on that horse!
There it is!
Steady, Gascon!
There's another way in.
Take her inside! Go to the barn! They're close behind!
Find the girl!
I'll take care of the riders!
They're coming!
Fire at will!
They come from behind!
Don't let them get away! Fire!
Aramis!
Fire!
Thank you!
Come on, Rochefort!
Come on!
- Aramis!
- Porthos!
Aramis!
Quickly!
...lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil...
What is it, sister?
My child.
Have no fear. Keep praying.
- The shooting...
- Will soon be over.
I'm a friend.
Soon you will be free.
- Monsieur D'Artagnan...
- He's here!
He will see you in a moment.
Go on with your prayers.
You should say a prayer for him.
- And the gallant gentelemen with him.
- Yes.
- Is he truly here, sister?
- He will not leave except with you.
So...
I shall wait with you.
"Only Porthos could invent a new way to disarm himself. "
Get away!
Child, you mustn't cry.
You must look your best for D'Artagnan.
Yes.
- Why is it always have to be me?
- You're getting old.
Where is Rochefort?
We haven't seen him.
Constance!
Constance!
You won't need a horse on the journey you're taking, Madame.
I warned you, did I not?
Be advised, Gascon! Turn and run!
You murderer!
Bastard!
Stop! Stop fighting!
We are all here as judges.
What is your sentence?
Death.
Death.
Death.
You are the headsman of me.
As the Comte de la Fere with the rights of high, middle and low justice,
- I want the death of this woman.
- Five pistoles.
D'Artagnan!
No!
No! You are not my judges.
Take me before a court! It is my right!
No!
You take one more step, D'Artagnan, and we will cross sword.
I swear to God,
I'll kill you this time.
Two more pistoles for rowing the boat. I'm a headsman, not a sailor.
Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Your sword, please! And yours, too!
In the name his eminence, the Cardinal!
I once held out my hand to you.
I do not do so now.
Now you'll stand trial for the murder of a valued servant of the state.
I fought Milady de Winter with their own weapons.
So you did. And won. Rochefort, too, a very considerable achievement.
But your victories are too expensive.
For me and for France.
I hold out France's hand for payment.
I shall not pay one sou, shed one tear, feel one grain of pity.
Then you must be tried.
You will be condemn.
I think not.
For all that I have done,
I have a proper warrant.
Signed by whom? The Queen can not, King would not.
By your hand, Your Eminence.
By my hand?
"By my hand and for the good of the state... the bearer has done what has been done. "
One should be careful what one writes.
And to whom one gives it.
I must bear those rules in mind.
This is commissioned in the King's musketeer. The name is blank, but it is to you I give it.
Your friends are free also.
Good day, Monsieur D'Artagnan.
Athos,
The Cardinal gave me this.
I can't take it. It should go to you.
For the Comte de la Fère it is too little, for Athos, it is too much.
You earned it, child.
Aramis, my dear friend.
You're a man of education, of reading.
Please. You're far more worthy of this than I am.
You forget, I am a
Musketeer only temporarily.
As soon as I find the time, I intend to be ordain into priesthood.
Look at this. Does it suit me? / Beautifully, but...
- this would suits you much better.
- Lieutenant!
You flattered me very much. But, no.
One must ask himself... is the commissioned something for a gentleman.
But if I'm Lieutenant, I shall lose all my friends!
A lieutenant is too proud, too noted for private Musketeers.
Even those who were kind to him when he first came. Young and foolish.
Running into everyone, challenge them to fight duels, making a complete nuisance of himself.
Brawling like a young ruffian with the
Cardinal's guards, while his friends, older and wiser, trying to restrain him and keep him out of mischief.
How we guided his faltering, boyish, foxy, witty, might have gone astray!
We teach the rules high society.
Taught him all of the fine arts a young gentleman ought to know.
Protected him against enemies and from temptations of this wicked world.
What would become of him without us?
Or we be without him?
That was from the old days.
When we were indeed:
"One for all and all for one".
So the last thing I have to tell you young fellows is this:
Play up and play the game!
Honor your queen and country.
Mind what your masters tell you.
Say your prayers each night.
Keep your minds and your bodies clean.
Take a cold bath each day.
And you'll find you can always look the world in the eye... like an English gentleman.
- Hear! Hear!
- Hear. Hear.
Now, my lads...
- I'm just a simple soldier.
- Oh! No, no, no.
Yes, I am though. But I tell you... if you follow these rules... then, when the last roll call comes... you'll be able to go up before the Great Headmaster... with a clean,
British conscience and say...
"Well, sir, I tried to do my duty."
And I think-
I think you'll find that's good enough for him.
Well-Well, I think that we have rarely heard... such man-inspiring address.
We are deeply indebted to Captain Flashman.
Let it be an example to you boys- especially when you remember that only a few short years ago...
Captain Flashman, whose name and fame has now run 'round the world...
as the hero of Kabul.
I need not tell you of the dauntless heroism he displayed in Afghanistan...
- Let me in! - of the matchless gallantry of his defense of Piper's Fort...
against overwhelming odds...
when he fought to the last against the heathen hordes.
Here! Take the bloody thing.
I don't want it. Take it!
Ofhow he was found the sole, gallant survivor...
- of the stricken field...
- There's a British officer there.
With his country's flag- nay, his country's honor-
- clasped to his wounded body.
- He's alive.
Get him there, Carruthers.
We're your relief, sir.
Nor need I remind you...
or embarrass his simple modesty...
by recalling the hero's welcome which his queen and his country...
gave this gallant English gentleman... whom we at Rugby School know as Harry Flashman.
But-But even-even heroes...
must work, and we must not...
keep him from his arduous military duties...
which claim his first allegiance.
Damn!
Come on. Oh, come on, you silly slut.
Place your bets, please, ladies and gentlemen.
It's 4-to-1. That's right.
It's 4-to-1 the field on Pink Lady. Lovely
Pink Lady there, sir. There she goes.
Lovely thighs.
What a wonderful bosom.
Hello, Freddie.
Doin' all right?
Waiter!
This game's as crooked as a line of Russian infantry- and a damn sight harder to beat.
Mesdames, monsieurs, place your bets, please.
I know a better line.
Come on.
Speedicut!
We'll, uh, play vingt-et-un, you see... and every time I lose a trick,
I'll give you a piece of my clothing- like, uh, a glove or something.
- What if I lose a trick?
- Silly little girl.
You'll learn the rules as we get along.
Quiet, lads. Now come on.
Quiet as you can.
Anybody makes a noise loses his pension.
Right. Up you go, lad.
Go on. Get in there.
- All right. All right, sir.
- Go on. Now hang on tight.
- Yes.
- Right, lads. Start cranking.
Can't stand heights,
Sergeant.
- Never mind that. Go on up.
Keep your eyes open.
- Now what can you see?
- Nothing.
Right. Take him up a bit more.
- I don't wanna go up any higher.
- Shut up. What can you see?
- Nothing.
- Take him right up.
Damnation!
Have you tarts been marking this deck?
Hmm. I see what the trouble is.
You're still too sober to play properly.
Soon attend to that.
Get him up. Get him up.
Get him up.
No, it's no good, Sergeant.
I can't see anything.
- All right. We'll go in the front door.
- Hey?
Hey, waiter! Waiter!
Look alive, dagger-eyes! More bubbly!
Right.
Shh! Shh!
Quiet.
Police!
Police! Quick!
All right, lads.
Cut and run. It's the traps!
Hide those chips, will ya?
Clean those tables off.
Don't panic, for God's sake.
Here you go, girls.
It's much too big.
No!
Lower away now.
Right. Upstairs. Upstairs!
Steady. Careful.
- All right.
- Get me down.
- Get me down, Sergeant.
- All right.
I can't stand heights.
Get me down.
You've cranked it up, sir.
Will you kindly crank it down?
I've had enough.
I wanna come down now.
Oh, I'm feeling sick.
- Sick!
- Oi! You!
Get down!
Right, lads!
- Come on.
- Help me!
Oh! Sorry.
- All right.
- Lads, right. Come back here!
Do the British always sleep?
Wake up, driver.
God save us. What the devil are you doing, sir?
- I'm hiding, ma'am.
- Well, I can see that.
Who from? And in my carriage, if you please.
Please, I mean no harm.
It's the police.
Oh, no. No.
I'm not a criminal.
I was in a club that was raided.
- Oh.
- Get out of this. Do you hear?
- Oh, please, sir-
- Get out!
Oh, let him alone, Otto.
Can't you see he's a gentleman?
Quick, you booby, onto the seat.
- Such a delightful party.
- Huh?
There I was, standing in a corner...
- Oh, yes!
- surrounded by three duchesses...
and only two of them drunk.
Excuse me, sir. Might you have seen a gentleman running?
Yes, Constable.
This is your man.
- Will you arrest him, please?
- Oh, stop it, Otto.
Really, Sergeant, it's too bad.
He's making game of you.
This gentleman is with us.
Yes. Stop playing the fool, Otto.
I'm tired. My leg hurts.
I need a nice rubdown.
Um, just there. Mmm.
The anguish.
Here. I know you.
You're Captain Flashman, be God.
The hero of Afghanistan!
- ByJove.
- Yeah.
The defender of Piper's Fort.
Well, here's a go.
He is a criminal fugitive who invaded our coach without permission.
I don't care if he invaded Buckingham
Palace without permission.
Yes.
You're not English, are you?
- I am a German officer, and I demand that-
- Yes. Well.
Captain Flashman is a British officer...
so you don't demand nothing.
Just move along, please.
Good night, sir. Adieu, ma'am.
Good night.
My dear, your face.
I am happy... that you are amused to make a fool of me.
- The devil take you then.
- How dare you insult a lady... you dirty foreigner!
I shall remember you.
Well, I shan't trouble to return the compliment.
Oh, yes, you will.
You will remember me.
- My name is Bismarck.
- Hmm.
These foreigners-can't look an Englishman in the eye.
Yes, but it put me next to a beautiful woman... and one of two things is inevitable:
She either surrenders or screams- sometimes both.
"Lola."
"Lola"!
Sounds like a foreign bedroom with purple wallpaper.
"Lola" what?
- Montez.
- Oh.
Lola Montez.
Ain't that a dago name?
You looked a bit dago.
- Thank you.
- Why didn't you give me away to the bobbies?
And have to spend the night with Otto Bismarck... who has nothing but ice and vinegar in his veins?
My dear, I wouldn't have given you away if you had been a murderer.
Bismarck is going to be a great man someday.
He told me so himself.
"I have a destiny to rule," says he.
I told him,
"I have my ambitions too."
And what might they be?
To be a queen in the theater... and to live as I please... love as I please and never grow old.
And if you're disappointed?
Courage.
And shuffle the cards.
Not a bad motto.
Well, I tell you,
I am a far greater man... than any Otto Bismarck.
Prove it.
You mean to say while I was spending the night... in a Bow Street cell, you were bumping that little beauty?
Well, damn your luck,
Flashy!
Only the brave deserve the fair.
My backside's like a pin cushion.
- Her hairbrush.
- Now. Now. Finish him!
Smash him!
- Why don't they hit each other?
- See what I mean?
Gently, sweetheart.
You're not in bed now, you know.
Hit him!
Well, well! If it ain't
Attila the Hun.
Ah, Count, glad to see you again.
Come to watch us English at play, what?
A sporting contest, ladies and gentlemen.
- Very sporting.
- And a fitting moment to introduce our guest of honor.
A member of Parliament, justice of the peace... many years ago, the heavyweight champion of all England.
Ladies and gentlemen, will you drink to John Gully.
John Gully!
You make much of this boxing, I see.
It is interesting enough to see two of the lower orders... slash each other with their fists.
But surely, well-bred men despair of this, no?
Well, Count, each country to its own game.
I hear in Germany that you fight duels just to get scars on your head.
The schlager, the dueling saber-
It gives a man honorable scars.
Besides, it is for gentlemen.
Dueling, you see, is a soldierly skill...
and, if you'll excuse me,
I see no skill in this.
Perhaps you think boxing's easy.
Do you fancy you could hold your own in a mill?
- Is that a challenge?
- Good Lord. No.
No, like you,
I'm a man of the sword.
But if you think that boxing ain't scientific...
then you need a good teacher, and the best teacher in all the world...
- is standing over there.
- Evening.
He'd be glad to instruct you.
That is a foolish proposition.
You see, Mr. Gully is far too old.
- Oh, too old.
- No, don't mind, eh?
It wouldn't be that he's a professional- one of the lower orders?
I am not interested whether he's a professional or not.
- So you say!
- What the devil? Damn it, Flashman.
I'm sick of his foreign airs.
Sneering at old Jack as though he weren't good enough!
The point is, if the count wants a friendly spar...
Jack'll oblige, won't you?
Well, look here.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
To convince our visitor here that there's more to the noble art than meets the eye...
I'll stand in front of him with my hands down... and let him try to plant a few facers on me.
Now what do you say, mein Herr?
You mean you'll stand there and not run away...
- and let me strike you?
- I'll let ya try.
Good.
But, damn it, he's a guest.
- You won't hurt him, Jack?
- Nah.
Now you must hit him fair- above the waist.
Now go easy, Jack, for God's sake.
Now, Mr. Gully.
Now... time!
Whoa!
Well done, mein Herr.
Never mind them.
They couldn't have done better.
Convinced now, Bismarck?
Ja. Ja.
There is skill, I admit... but I would be obliged if you would try me again... and this time, you will strike me in return.
No. No.
Enough. Enough.
No. No, Tom.
This man's a sportsman.
I'll spar easy with you, Count. You can go home and say you fought the champion.
Come on, square head!
Jolly good, eh?
Enough. Enough.
That'll do.
You shouldn't ought to have done that, mein Herr.
- That's not fair when a man's not looking.
- So... you do not wish to continue?
- Best not.
- Very well. If you've had enough.
I quit to no man.
Why, you limey bastard!
It was a most useful instruction.
Jolly game, boxing, ain't it?
Great builder of character, they tells me.
I have to thank you for this.
Someday, Captain Flashman, since you are a man of the sword...
I hope you'll come to Germany...
where we Germans can show you how to fight with the saber.
Mr. Gully.
And now... again.
Encore!
Oh, Lord, no. Not again, for heaven's sake.
It's like making love under a coil of barbed wire.
Yes! Again.
En garde!
Put that confounded thing down, damn you.
I'm tired.
No one-No one gets tired of me!
Well, I do!
You're-You're insatiable, you!
I'm mistress in this house!
It's my pleasure that counts!
You call yourself a man!
- I never did.
Empty, thank God.
- You get too tired of me, will you?
I'll teach you to spurn Lola Montez!
I don't need any teaching.
Find yourself some other idiot-
Is he the castrati?
He's not wearing any-
You!
What the hell?
Allow me, ma'am.
Oh!
That's her over there!
I'll kill you for this, Lola Montez.
You Spanish strumpet!
La-La-La-Ladies.
Gracious.
Oh, no.
Oh, my goodness.
Blood. Blood.
That may let some of the wind out of her.
Madam Montez, as your legal adviser, I did warn you.
N- Now you'll have to leave England at once.
This is attempted murder.
Very well.
Oh, dear. Uh, hello?
Uh, Captain-
Captain Flashman.
Who's here? Anybody here by the name of Captain Flashman?
- Hmm?
- Hello, whoever you are!
- Oh.
- Over here!
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
Captain Flashman.
- Hmm.
- Well, pull up a hip bath.
What?
Uh, no, thank you. I... had a bath last month.
I take it, uh,
Captain Flashman... that you haven't heard anything from Madam Lola Montez... since she had to leave the country so hurriedly... after that most distressing affair, hmm?
Not a word, thank God.
You see, she writes to me asking me to find this Captain Flashman... and provide him with, well, very generous expenses...
and requesting him to visit her in Bavaria.
What the deuce is Lola doing in Bavaria?
Well, uh, from all accounts... she's, uh, well-
She's ruling the place.
Mmm. She is, in fact, the uncrowned queen of Bavaria.
A more apt term would be... she's the mistress of Bavaria.
- You see, sir...
when she left this country, Madam Montez traveled widely in Europe...
appearing in, um, a professional capacity.
Her activities excited considerable attention...
among some very highly distinguished personages...
including His Majesty,
King Ludwig of Bavaria.
- He was much taken by her performance, I'm told.
I don't believe they're real.
No, no, no.
I meant the spiders.
In short, he became her devoted slave... and she-the virtual ruler of his kingdom.
Uh, well, in here, she instructs me... to pay you
£500 in gold... and she requests that you visit her in Munich... in order to perform... a very delicate service for her.
Well, I'm damned.
Little Lola.
Munich.
Hmm?
Thankee, son.
Herr Rittmeister Flashman, my privilege to welcome you to Bavaria.
Freiherr Rudi von Sternberg at your service.
Useful weapon this.
Quite new.
No doubt. In the British army, of course, t'ain't a weapon that counts.
'Tis the man behind it.
How very fortunate for the British army.
But we mustn't waste time.
Lola can't abide to be kept waiting.
You seem to know her pretty well.
- Well enough.
- For a messenger boy, I mean.
Anything to oblige a lady.
I have other duties- when I feel like them.
Not a bad little cottage.
- My chair, I think, Madam.
Oh, excuse me.
I believe you are even handsomer than ever.
And you're still the most beautiful girl in all the world.
What's, uh-What's this very delicate service I'm to perform for you?
Hmm? You'll see.
Baroness Pechman.
How do you do?
- Overblown bag of blubber.
- Mmm.
- Oh, my bloody foot!
I'm frightfully sorry.
Lola, let's go to bed, you and me.
Come on! You and me!
You are tired, Harry.
You should lie down.
I'm good when I'm tired.
Let's make each other tired.
Come on, Lola!
Very well. Over here.
I know you find me irresistible.
Darling. Darling Lola.
I'm at me very, very best when I'm tight.
- In a moment.
- Moment. Oh, Lola.
Oh, Lola.
Lola.
Lola.
- Ooh.
- You're not Lola. Get off!
Fat slut.
Get away.
What do you want, you great randy cow?
Oh, no. Oh!
No woman ever did that to me!
No!
All right then.
Since you're here.
Wha-Oh. Wha-
Take your hand- that-away from me.
Stand still, you.
- You're under arrest!
- What? For God's sake.
That's not a crime.
I demand to see the countess!
The British ambassador?
Ow! Ooh. All right.
How dare you lay your hands on an Englishman, you cabbage-eating hounds!
What am I supposed to have done, confound you?
I don't know what you call it in English... but we have several names for it in German:
"Indecent assault,"
"corruption of public morals"...
"disorderly conduct."
For your bestial behavior, you could go to prison for life... but there are more appropriate forms of punishment.
Huh?
No.
Up, man!
Run for it!
Very good.
Sternberg!
Sternberg!
- Sternberg!
- Coming!
Shit!
- Wha-
- Missed!
But why didn't you come in through the door?
Well, I do like to make an entrance.
You'll need this.
It's a long way.
But, damn it!
Where are we going?
Why the deuce must we come all this way?
It ought to be safe by now.
It's never safe with villains like those after you.
Didn't I rescue you?
Put your trust in me.
Oh, very well.
But I wish you'd tell me.
- What's that?
- Schönhausen.
Friends of mine.
Ever read Frankenstein?
Splendid stuff.
Come on.
You'll like it.
Better than those seedy hotels where they don't air the beds.
Oh, yes. Now, you've met
Kraftstein and De Gautet before.
Two members of the local friendly society... better known as the Brothers Grimm.
- Bastard.
- I'm sorry. I'm afraid my "rescue"... was just a little comedy played out for your benefit.
Rather artistic, though, don't you think?
- And it did get you here quietly.
- You kidnapped me!
Welcome to Schönhausen,
Mr. Flashman.
Please, sit down.
There.
You don't seem pleased to see me... but then why should you, hmm?
There is a score to settle.
I still have a tooth missing.
But don't imagine that is why
I had you brought to Germany.
Amazing as it may seem,
Mr. Flashman, I need you.
Kraftstein, give him a brandy.
He will need it.
Tell me something,
Mr. Flashman... in between your whoring... and your drinking... have you taken any interest in politics?
- Hmm?
- Politics?
Well, I'm a Tory.
My governor was a Tory M.P. - until they found him out.
I am a politician.
Someday I shall be the statesman responsible for uniting... the present loose German states into a stronger Germany-into a Reich.
That is my destiny.
One of these little German states I wish to see incorporated in this Reich... is called Strackenz.
It's a small, independent duchy ruled over by a young and popular duchess.
Her name is Irma.
In two weeks time, she is to be married to a certain...
Crown Prince Carl Magnus of Oldenburg.
He's Scandinavian.
It is vitally important for political reasons... for my plans, this wedding should take place.
You understand?
By all means.
Splendid!
Good luck to the happy couple.
There has been a serious complication.
The crown prince, an admirable young man in many ways... has been... foolish.
He has contracted a social disease.
A what?
A social disease.
You mean he's got a dose of clap?
Well, that's damned inconsiderate of him.
Ha! Still, boys will be boys.
Will you hold your imbecile tongue!
Fortunately, there are very few people who know about his condition.
It will take several months to cure him... and this wedding must take place in two weeks.
Well, talk sense, man.
I mean, it can't... not if this prince fellow has Cupid's measles.
It will take place,
Mr. Flashman.
It will.
I scheduled it.
You see...
this is Crown Prince
Carl Magnus.
No! No!
You raving bloody lunatics!
No! I see it all now.
You want me to take his place! I won't do it!
Bloody Vandals.
- You've ruined me.
- We're making you stouter, too... like Carl Magnus.
Filled with oil, so be careful... when you strike a match, and on no account take your shirt off.
Astounding.
In effect, he is Carl Magnus- except for two small details.
- What?
- The prince, as you see, has two dueling scars... one each side of his face.
Here... and here.
Souvenirs of his dueling days when he was a student at Heidelberg.
- How do we give him those?
- Well, they must be permanent.
Oh, no! For God's sake, Bismarck.
Haven't you any decency left?
- I'll be maimed for life, disfigured.
- Be quiet!
You sniveling pig.
I'm not going to kill you.
A sip from the soup plate of honor will do you good.
And, remember... if it hurts at all, the pain has been paid for in advance... by your amiable friend,
John Gully.
Well, I ain't gonna wear blinkers, damn ye!
I salute you, you animal!
Pish to you.
Distance.
Prepare.
Ow.
Stand still and only strike for the head.
Fight.
Halt!
Faster, Mr. Flashman.
Much faster, please.
Fight!
Halt!
Good.
That was very good.
And now we do it for real!
Really. Real.
Fight!
You-You bully, you!
Blood.
Pick it up.
Pick it up!
Or Kraftstein will cut the other one with a rusty saw.
Well, it ain't fair, damn you.
My skull's fractured.
Bastard!
What kind of a man are you, Mr. Flashman?
- An Englishman.
- An Englishman? Then hold him. Hold him!
Ow. Ow!
Excellent, hmm?
Both to the inch,
Herr Sternberg.
Leave the wounds open so that he scars properly.
I have the feeling our task will be easier.
You are beginning to behave like royalty already.
His Royal Highness, Prince Carl Ragna
Adolphus Magnus...
crown prince of Oldenburg...
great-great-grandson of George III.
He's a vigorous and athletic young man... who walks with a military swagger... usually with his left hand in the small of his back.
He has an aristocratic manner, especially to his social inferiors...
and a peculiar nervous habit of tugging at the lobe of his right ear...
when he is puzzled or nervous.
But he never claws at his buttocks.
Royalty hardly ever do.
He is extremely fond of German wine, but never drinks claret... which, invariably, makes him sick.
He likes snuff, and he's expert at opening his snuff box with one hand... and taking a pinch.
Come on. Hyah! Hyah!
His Royal Highness is an enthusiastic player of billiards...
pyramids and pool and is extremely expert at performing trick shots...
- for the entertainment of his friends.
- Excellent.
He is also a skillful dancer...
and takes special delight in the new
Bohemian peasant dance, the polka...
which he performs with the prettiest partners he can find.
Berlin, sir!
Oh, God, Jesus.
Make it by.
Come on.
Down the wire!
Enjoying yourself?
He begins to look the part.
- Just in time, I feel. Hmm?
- He'll do.
Oh, he'll do.
Your education is over.
From this moment on, you begin to play your part in earnest.
Your life may depend on it.
The crown prince is not due to enter
Strackenz until the day after tomorrow.
You will spend tomorrow night on the borders of the duchy in the château at Tarleheim.
Prost.
Oh, Kraftstein.
Ow!
That's it. Grovel, you commoners.
Welcome to Strackenz,
Your Highness.
I trust Your Highness's journey was not too tedious.
No. No, indeed.
Though I must confess,
I counted the hours all the way.
Oh.
Was the weather cold on your journey?
At times.
Sometimes it was quite warm... but nowhere as warm as it is here.
Oh, Your Highness is too hot.
Shall I order the windows open?
Oh, Christ, no.
No. I mean... the warmth of your welcome.
The people cheering.
Ah, yes.
The people.
They are rather noisy.
This is a passionate female.
She'll be tearing my trousers off in a minute.
Pay her a compliment, man.
Say something gallant.
Highness, may I say-
May I tell you-
You're the loveliest piece of tumble I've seen all year.
L- I mean-
Your beauty- so, so pale.
Like mist in a cemetery.
Highness-
Shall we dance?
What are we going to play?
- Turn back two pages. Turn back two pages.
- What?
Ready?
It was like dancing with a dead nun.
Heaven help the real Carl Magnus.
And on this historic day... we humbly- humbly...
invite Your Royal Highness to inaugurate...
Strackenz's first public locomotive... steam rail road train and carriages... traveling at speeds... in excess of 10 miles every hour.
What? Every hour?
Your Highness.
Mmm. Mmm.
Mmm!
I have great pleasure... in declaring this locomotive...
Steam rail road train... open!
Sorry, Your Highness.
Get him outta here.
Get another bottle.
Get another bottle.
Your Highness. Get him outta here.
Another bottle.
Sorry.
Get another bottle.
A crisis has arisen.
Oh, it's all right.
They'll find another bottle.
Ayoung Strackenzian nobleman has arrived in the city today.
His name is Eric Hansen.
He is coming to your wedding tomorrow.
So what?
It just happens that this Hansen is the one man in the whole of Strackenz... who knows Carl Magnus intimately.
He was brought up at the Oldenburg court... and was the prince's playmate and companion.
What? My God!
He'll see I'm a fake!
- He'll start-
- Shh! Shh! Be silent, will you?
There is no reason to suppose that he will not think you are the real prince.
He will only meet you for a moment at the presentations afterwards.
The vital thing is that you must pretend to recognize him.
- Oh.
- And say as little as possible.
When he comes up to you, you will shake him by the hand... and you will say, "Eric, my old friend, where did you spring from?"
And then you will look delighted.
What happens if he sees through me... and starts shouting,
"That ain't the real prince!"?
What will you do then?
I'll have done it... long before then.
Your Highness, we're ready for you.
Your Majesty.
Highness, thank you.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Eric, where did you spring-
It's open!
Get me a brandy, for God's sake.
In nomine Patris et Filii... et Spiritu Sancti.
In nomine Patris et Filii...
et Spiritu Sancti.
- Amen.
- Amen.
His Excellency the ambassador...
from the government of the kingdom of Naples.
His Excellency
Suleiman Pasha.
The Right Honorable
Cassius Clay... ambassador from the government of the United States of America.
Count Otto von Bismarck
Schönhausen.
On behalf of the Berlin parliament, greetings, Highness.
Bismarck, did he say?
Haven't you had the honor of being presented to me before somewhere?
I think not, Highness.
Oh, well.
These Central Europeans all look alike to me.
His Excellency the British ambassador.
Hansen.
Mr. Eric Hansen.
Eric, where did you spring from?
Eric, where did you spring from?
Spring!
Where did you Eric from?
Your Highness.
Dear Carl.
Old friend, I had to come to wish you joy- you and your beautiful duchess.
I... beg your pardon,
Highness.
His Excellency the French ambassador.
And now- the royal photograph.
He knew I wasn't the real prince.
Suppose he talks.
- No. He wasn't sure at first.
- Here.
But he doesn't suspect anything now.
Of that I'm certain.
My God, I hope so.
Oh!
Anyway, we'll keep a close eye on Master Hansen.
He is one of the Strackenz Volsungs... dedicated to keeping the duchy out of Germany's clutches.
They run a secret organization... prepared to fly to arms the moment that they feel that the freedom... of their precious little country is threatened.
You can guess what they'll do to you if they find out about you.
Secret organization?
But you didn't tell me anything-
Don't worry, Your Highness.
It won't happen.
You may as well lie back and enjoy your honeymoon...
until the real Carl Magnus is ready to take over.
Come in.
Pardon, Highness.
Uh, the crown jewels.
We have to place them in safekeeping again-in the clock tower.
Ah.
Very efficient.
Come along,
Your Highness.
We mustn't keep the duchess waiting.
I'm sure she's as eager to be on her honeymoon as you are.
Irma?
Irma? Little wife.
There'll be no more singing downstairs.
We'll have a chorus up here instead.
Irma.
I'm not going to hurt you.
- Oh. Just once more.
- Oh, my. Oh, God.
- Not again.
- Oh, yes!
A little more chocolate, my darling?
It's so cold and misty outside.
We could stay indoors... all day.
Oh!
Must you go boar hunting so soon- after only a week together?
I think you've grown bored with me already.
This indigestion.
Promise you won't be long.
Will you think of me while slaughtering all those boars?
Every moment.
- Good morning, Your Grace.
- Hmm!
Let the hunt begin.
- Release the hounds.
- Aye, sir.
What? Hounds?
Doggies.
- Let's go, Dasher.
- On, my proud beauties!
Kill!
Ain't the doggies found the boars yet?
Hmm?
This is considered the finest view in Strackenz.
Mmm.
It's called theJotunschlucht- the Giant's Cauldron.
You don't say.
De Gautet, we-
We could talk about this.
Huh? Huh?
Please, De Gau-
- Oh, my heart!
- Huh?
Well!
You backstabbing rat, you!
No!
Murder me, would you?
Please! It was
Bismarck's order.
- Please!
- Why did he want me killed?
The story about Carl-
Carl Magnus was all lies.
There was nothing wrong with him.
Bismarck put you in his place.
Then you were to be killed.
When your body was found-
They'd find papers in your pocket...
proving that you were an English agent.
- What could Bismarck possibly gain from that?
- Everything.
Strackenz would be in total confusion.
Germany would then have an excuse... to march in and take over the duchy.
Aye. You can howl now.
A fat lot of mercy you showed me... and I bet you didn't show any to the real Count Magnus, heh?
- Where is he?
- He's alive! I swear it!
- Plea-Plea-
- Where?
Jotunberg Castle.
In-In the dungeon.
He was to be killed, also, after you.
You murderous jackal, you!
You don't deserve to live another minute.
Please! Let me go.
So I will- down there.
Auf Wiedersehen, De Gautet.
Come to jolly Germany.
Cabbage-eating bastards!
Come on. Pull the rope tighter.
We'll make him talk.
They forced me to do it,
I tell you.
Well, that fiend Bismarck- he stops at nothing.
Believe me, gentlemen.
So, my fine young
English friend... you say you were compelled to impersonate the prince, Carl Magnus... and to marry our duchess... and this was a plot of the German, Count Bismarck.
Well, it's true.
On my honor.
They kidnapped me-
And my wife.
My real wife, that is.
And my little daughter.
They swore they'd kill them if I didn't agree to do it.
My own daughter, gentlemen.
My little... golden-haired Amelia.
Will I ever see her again?
Oh, he's lying.
It can't be true.
The thing's impossible.
They cut scars on me... forced me to wear a monocle.
Now, look!
Whether your story is true or false... you are a dead man... unless you tell us where the real Carl Magnus is.
In a dungeon in Jotunberg.
We must get him out of there before it's too late.
But we daren't attack. They'll cut his throat at the sound of the first shot.
Aye. Where a whole army is useless... two desperate men might succeed.
Now, if they swam the lake, stole into the castle undetected... one of them could make his way to the dungeon to protect the prince... while the other could lower the drawbridge.
Carl Magnus is my friend.
I'll go.
And who goes with you to die at the drawbridge?
- Honestly, I'm a rotten swimmer.
- Silence!
Either you die righting the wrong you've done, or you hang!
- Agreed?
- Yes. Yes.
So. We charge in... and we'll have Carl Magnus out alive, God willing.
Or there'll be no survivors of that garrison.
Hear! Hear!
As for you, you have nothing to lose but your life.
Don't worry. I'll find your kidnapped wife and daughter.
Take comfort.
That dear little golden-haired Amelia is always in my thoughts.
We'll have to swim most of the way.
How did you know that
I wasn't Carl Magnus anyway?
The saber scars on your head are in the wrong place.
So much for Bismarck's clever planning. Conceited ass.
God help Germany when he's in charge.
We'll swim from here.
- What?
- Follow me!
- God! It's freezing.
- Go on!
Go on!
Aah! I've got cramp!
I've got cramp!
Save me!
Save me!
Sharks! Sharks!
Quiet, you miserable coward, or I'll drown you myself!
Swim this way, Crown Prince Flashy.
Come along.
There's a good chap.
You don't want to catch cold, do you?
Who's your dead friend?
Please. Please, don't shoot.
- It's Hansen.
- Serve him right.
- You're trembling, man.
- I'm cold, sir.
Not as cold as he is.
Come on. Out with you.
Kraftstein! Wolfgang!
Into the dungeons!
The Englishman's down there.
Flush him out!
Kraftstein? Is that you?
Someone's in the old torture chamber.
Oh, God. Oh, God, get me out of this.
I swear, I'll be good for the rest of my life.
Who are you?
My face.
Who are you, in God's name?
I never looked like that.
Allow me to make the introductions, Highness.
Who is this man?
What is he doing here?
Until recently, he was Prince Carl Magnus.
But in fact, Highness, he's an Englishman...
who has been kind enough to deputize for you during your holiday here.
You're trying to drive me mad.
If you have a spark of decency... then, for the love of heaven, tell me what you want!
Gently. Yes, Your Highness, all in good time.
- May I?
- Oh.
Thank you.
Cheerful fellows, the old lords ofJotunberg.
When they got tired of you, they just chained you to one of these- and... down you went.
It may console Your Highness to know that one of your friends... is already waiting for you at the bottom of the lake.
Hansen, his name was.
Eric Hansen?
What have you done to him?
He went swimming when there was an "R" in the month.
And now, with Your Highness's permission, we'll bid you good night.
You.
You with my face.
Why don't you speak?
Good night,
Your Highness.
All right, Kraftstein, you look after the original.
I'll take care of the forgery.
- What are you going to do?
- Don't be nervous.
If I had wanted you dead, you'd have stopped twitching half an hour ago.
No, you and I are going to try out a little scheme of mine.
After you.
Now, look, what if Kraftstein were to meet with a fatal accident tonight, hmm?
And the real prince went down the pipe into the lake?
Shirt.
Oh. Thank you.
What's to prevent you and me slipping back to Strackenz City... and you resume your rightful place on the throne... with your humble servant by your side?
- What a partnership.
- What the hell are you driving at?
Don't you see, man? Who would know you weren't the real prince?
Just you... and me.
You'd be the virtual ruler of the duchy.
Do you know what its revenues amount to? Hmm?
You're mad. Stick my neck into that again?
I'd rather be alive and... poor, thankee.
Where's your spirit, play actor?
Hmm?
Oh, I see what it is.
- You don't trust me.
- Well, now that you come to mention it.
But of course we don't trust each other.
That's the whole point.
We're both rotten, but we both know it.
All right. All right.
But how do we get rid of Kraftstein?
Spoken like an English gentleman.
Let's drink to our partnership.
Drawbridge.
Drawbridge.
Drawbridge.
Never hit a man when he's down.
He may get up.
Drawbridge.
Oh, blast.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
To the front! To the front!
Bad form to sneak away without saying good-bye.
Good-bye.
Not quick enough.
Really.
They stopped De Gautet this time, you know.
Aha! Don't like cold steel, do we?
Ha!
No! Don't shoot!
Garlic.
Are you all right, you British?
- Stand and fight.
- Why should I?
So that you can show off your swordsmanship? Oh.
Mm-mmm.
Aha!
Whoa!
- Come down and fight like a man.
- Don't be ridiculous.
Hungarian pimp!
Wh-Whoa!
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha!
Please, no. No.
Uh!
Wha-
You can't run forever.
Stand to 'em, Kraftstein!
They're only a pack of ploughmen.
- Make a bridge.
- What?
Make a bridge.
Go on.
Son of a pig!
Charge!
Charge!
The guards!
Highness, the keys.
Well, stop biting.
Damn you.
Pax. Pax.
I surrender.
Is that the way you English win your wars?
Since when did you last fight fair?
Well, I was fairly young.
In 1844.
No, you stupid bastard!
Throw 'em at him, Highness.
No! I'm on your side!
Grundwig, the door!
Break that door down.
All right, you-
Ow!
Not that door.
This door.
Ow!
Bad luck, old fellow.
You'll go together.
You can't get rid of me.
Spread out!
I'll get you!
Ow!
Two birds with one stone.
Au revoir,
Your Highnesses.
No! No!
Not down the drain!
Poor little golden-headed Amelia.
Was that what his name was?
There are enemies of the state close behind me!
Whoa!
Get me a fresh horse!
Food in the saddlebags.
I'm riding out!
Open the door.
Come on.
I'm a prince.
No one to leave or enter the palace!
Understand me?
- There's a rebellion brewing!
- Halt!
Someone is trying to impersonate me!
Don't let him in!
Highness!
It's the prince!
It's the prince!
He's safe! He's safe.
Oh, Carl! Carl, you're safe.
Oh, my darling!
My darling, darling, darling, darling!
Oh, Carl.
Where have you been?
Are you all right, my dearest?
There-There, there.
It's all right.
There's been a-
There's been a-a plot.
Um, an armed rebellion.
But it's-It's all right now.
A plot?
Against my duchy?
Against us, my dear.
But don't worry.
It's all right.
Everything's all right.
It's finished, or nearly.
Who was it?
Who dared?
Oh, well, it was, uh-
It was, uh, some chaps.
But, uh, my darling,
I've got to leave you again.
Oh! Leave me?
Oh, dear.
Oh, you're so thin.
Oh.
- And your hair.
- Oh. Sunstroke.
Darling, don't worry. It's nearly over.
There's only one thing
I've got to do that only I can do- my duty to you, to Strackenz!
Darling-Oh.
Darling, you must stay here and do your duty as a duchess, Duchess.
Oh. Oh, I wonder if there's time.
No! No!
I must go.
Darling, I must leave you.
I'll-I'll be back.
I love you.
My own prince.
I love you.
I really love her-
I think.
In a way.
- Lieutenant!
- Highness.
There's been a threat to the duchess's life.
Take your soldiers, guard her apartment.
Yes, of course, Highness.
But our duty here-the crown jewels?
Ah.
- Lieutenant, you're not married?
- No, Highness.
Then perhaps you're... a lover.
Ah. Then you understand.
Take good care of her for me, would you?
W- With my life,
Highness!
Ah!
Highness.
Highness, allow me to carry that, if you please.
Josef, no, no, no.
You go to bed. Good night.
- But, Highness-
- Good night, Josef.
Good. Put it over there.
So, Strackenz is lost to us, hmm?
For the moment.
With half Europe in the grip of revolution, that is no matter.
And that English thief is not beyond our reach.
Hmm. If I know him at all... he will run to the last place we would think of looking for him.
Away from England.
- Munich.
- Precisely.
When you have disposed of him, you will report back to me, please.
- Oh.
- Already it is out of date.
I go to redraw it... in German script.
I have the feeling
I shall be... busy for the next
30 years, hmm?
Throw her out! Throw her out!
Get Lola out of Munich!
- The bloody Spanish whore!
- Is Lola Montez still in the palace?
- The Lola Montez?
- That's her.
- Whore!
- The vulgar, bloody fiend!
You two move right back!
- Don't let her through.
- Got a coach as well, have you?
- Make her bleedin'walk.
- She's all right.
Stop the bloody coach.
Don't let her get away.
Walk the bleedin'earth.
Lola!
Lola!
Lola! It's me-Harry!
Harry Flashman!
Lola, wait!
Get away!
Leave me alone!
It's me! Can't you see?
Harry Flashman.
- You? What are you doing here?
- Let me in, for God's sake. I need your help.
Otto Bismarck's after me.
For God's sake. I've got no money.
- Whip up, driver.
- It's all your fault.
Lola, I love ya, you selfish bitch.
You're raving!
Get out!
Get out of my sight!
Stop, coachman!
Lola?
Lola!
Did you change your mind?
Harry.
Oh, Lola.
Harry.
I knew, in spite of everything, you'd never desert me.
- How could I, my darling?
- Mmm.
Can you forgive me for what happened?
Oh, that.
Hmm.
You've had your share of bad luck too.
Ungrateful swine, these kings.
I only wish
I could help you.
But I'm penniless, you see.
I know.
Lola?
Lola?
Jesus!
Thieving bitch!
L- I'm ruined.
Oh, Jesus.
I can never resist other people's correspondence.
Do join me.
Hmm?
Dear Harry.
My need is greater than yours.
I trust we shall not meet again, and yet...
dear, worthless Harry...
there will always be a place for you in the heart of Lola Montez.
P.S. Courage.
And shuffle the cards.
What a woman.
You know, if I were a marrying man... she'd be the last female on God's earth for me.
Ah, well.
Good-bye.
A little game
I've invented.
I think I'll call it
Hungarian roulette.
Have a try.
You see, old fellow, when I kill you... it'll be because I want to... and not because
Otto Bismarck says so.
- You do see the difference?
- Oh, absolutely.
What are you gonna do?
Go abroad, I think.
Bismarck's such a damn bore.
But then I suspect great men usually are.
What about you?
Hmm.
That damn Lola's cleaned me out.
Ah, well, I've still got the 500 quid she gave me to come to Germany.
Well, it's better than nothing.
Yes, and as I always say...
if you've got money in the bank and drink in the house...
what more do you want?
My turn, I think.
Hell's bells, Rudi!
Somebody could have been killed!
Well, that is the point of the game.
But I could have been killed.

(Man) It is the opportunity[br]of a lifetime, Admiral Canaris.
A wonderful chance to show[br]what the Abwehr is capable of.
Wouldn't you agree,[br]Reichsführer Himmler?
After the miracle you have effected[br]in rescuing Il Duce, anything is possible.
Our own glorious[br]Sturmbannführer Skorzeny merely shares your instinct for daring.
We cannot expect less from section[br]three of our beloved Abwehr. We will not.
Well, our Führer was in rare form today,[br]I must say.
Do you really think so?
I, for one, thought his proposition[br]to you rather challenging.
So is harpooning a whale[br]with a sewing needle.
May I remind you that only yesterday
Il Duce was surrounded[br]by his own troops on Gran Sasso - a virtual prisoner -[br]and today he is our honoured guest.
Oh, yes, a daring raid[br]faultlessly executed.
Congratulate your Sturmbannführer,[br]Skorzeny.
Coming from another man of daring,[br]such as yourself, Herr Admiral,
- I'm sure it will be doubly appreciated.[br]- This, erm... new plan of our Führer's.
This... This pipe dream.
It is exactly that, you know.
I would have thought a feasibility study[br]at the very least was in order.
Surely the Abwehr can handle that?
If it had been proposed to your SS...
The SS was created to lead, Herr Admiral, to be the very soul[br]and conscience of the Reich.
And since national victory[br]is now inevitable,
I would advise us all to look[br]to our own... personal victory as well.
Heil Hitler.
- Morning.[br]- Good morning, Herr Admiral.
Oberst Radl - send him to me at once.
I've notified Oberst Radl of your arrival.
Thank you.
Come in, Radl.
- Herr Admiral.[br]- Come and sit down.
Your meeting went well? The Führer[br]had something specific in mind?
A simple exercise in logistics.
Nothing very complicated.
He merely wants Winston Churchill[br]brought from London to Berlin.
And we are ordered[br]to make a feasibility study.
Today is Wednesday.[br]By Friday, he will forget it.
But Himmler will not.
Reichsführer Himmler approved?
Only of my being put on the spot.
That meeting![br]You should have seen it, Radl.
There was Hitler -[br]first ranting, then cajoling.
And then perfectly rational.
Then raging and stamping like a...
Like the ringmaster of some freak circus.
Goebbels, hopping from one foot[br]to another like a... like a schoolboy.
Bormann - a vulture... perched in the corner -[br]watching, listening, never speaking.
And Mussolini... Mussolini!
An automaton, Radl.
And I looked round that room,[br]and I wondered... am I the only one who can see it?
And if so, what must I look like to them?
Herr Admiral, the feasibility study...
Will be a total[br]and unnecessary waste of time.
Make it immediately.
Why not put a bullet through your head,[br]it's quicker.
And others need the brandy.
You had an appointment[br]for an examination this morning at ten.
You had another two weeks ago[br]and another two weeks before that.
The Admiral and I were discussing[br]a special project for our Führer.
In spite of your skills as a doctor,
I believe my health was better[br]served by keeping that appointment.
You didn't chain-smoke to remind me[br]what a stubborn ass you are, Max.
You'll be flicking your own ashes[br]on my grave soon enough.
Not if you stop[br]this idiotic self-destruction.
And die in May as opposed to October?
If I am to die, let me die in peace, hm?
Heil Hitler.
Complete for the last month.
If Herr Oberst could give me[br]a rough idea of our problem...?
I can be quite specific about it.
The Führer has instructed us[br]to kidnap Winston Churchill.
Good God!
Well, Karl,[br]do at least a feasibility study on it.
Something which might[br]fit our needs came in yesterday.
Just a mention,[br]as far as I remember. If I may, sir?
Here it is. From codename Starling.
A village in England[br]called Studley Constable.
How do we receive reports[br]from this Starling?
From the Spanish Embassy in London[br]by diplomatic pouch, also by radio.
Exactly where is Studley Constable?
The east coast of England.[br]Er... county of Norfolk.
Let's have a look at the place.
- Larger scale.[br]- Jawohl, Herr Oberst.
Ah... here.
Ah, Herr Oberst.
Isolated coastline, very rural,[br]wide beaches, salt marshes.
Ideal.
Now, a man to lead it, Karl.
Crash-landed, 1940 - glider assault.
Albert Canal, Belgium,[br]dropped into Crete, '41...
Wounded taking Máleme airfield...[br]Knight's Cross.
Led volunteer assault group of 300,[br]special action, Leningrad.
Stalingrad Knight's Cross[br]with oak leaves and swords.
January this year, dropped into Kiev[br]with 167 surviving in unit, to get two cut-off regiments[br]out of Russia.
- Oberst Kurt Steiner.[br]- And has the language?
Educated in England.
Third time in the last month, despite Göring's personal guarantee.
Are you familiar[br]with the works of Jung, Karl?
I am aware of the works of Jung,[br]not familiar, Herr Oberst.
A very great thinker. A rational man.
And yet he speaks of something[br]called synchronicity - events having a coincidence in time, creating the feeling[br]that a deeper motivation is involved.
- Ja, I understand that, sir.[br]- Take this affair.
The Führer makes the absurd suggestion that we emulate Skorzeny[br]by abducting Churchill.
We have to make a worthless[br]report on the prospects.
Suddenly, synchronicity[br]rears its disturbing head.
- Ja. I see that.[br]- We receive a routine report with a brief notation that next month,[br]after visiting a local bomber command,
Churchill will spend[br]a weekend in a country manor less than seven miles[br]from a deserted coastline.
At any other time,[br]this report would mean nothing.
At this particular time, and in that particular file...
...it becomes a circumstance[br]which titillates.
A coincidence to... tease us.
Surely Herr Oberst[br]doesn't believe it can be carried off.
A wink from a pretty girl[br]at a party results rarely in climax... but a man is a fool not to push[br]a suggestion as far as it will go.
Find this man.[br]He's been out of Germany too long.
Los, los, weiter. Schnell!
Los, los!
Hans...
Hans!
Let's stretch our legs.
Los, weiter!
Stay on the train.
No one allowed off the train.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Sir, you must remain on the train.
If memory serves me,[br]the Polish army surrendered in 1939.
- Sir?[br]- Who are these people?
- Oh, Jews, sir.[br]- Jews?
We are razing the ghetto to the ground.[br]Burning them out. They put up a fight.
Oh, how? With umbrellas and crutches?
Halt! Halt!
- I'll take the prisoner now.[br]- Prisoner?
What is...
- What is your name?[br]- Brana.
Good luck, Brana.
Identify yourself.
Oberst Kurt Steiner.
Commanding[br]the 12th Parachute Detachment.
A salute is customary[br]to a general, Herr Oberst.
Even to one of SS.
You didn't seem quite so[br]discriminating a moment ago.
I have nothing[br]for or against Jews, personally.
But I've seen too many[br]good men die for cause, to watch a girl be killed for sport!
Straub was doing his duty...
He's like something I might pick[br]up on my shoe in the gutter - very unpleasant on a hot day!
If you have the dubious honour[br]of commanding this slaughter,
I'd advise you to keep him[br]downwind at all times.
That is, if you can tell the difference.
For God's sake, Kurt.
What am I to do with you, Herr Oberst?
You're a military hero, awarded the Knight's Cross for gallantry.
Yet responsible for the attempted escape[br]of an enemy of the state, abetted by the mutinous conduct[br]of your men.
By rights, you should all[br]be court-martialled.
Difficult decisions are the privilege[br]of rank, Herr Gruppenführer.
But, as for my men... they seem to feel a certain loyalty to me.
I, er... don't suppose you could[br]content yourself with my head and overlook their part in this thing?
Huh?
There you are, you see, Hans?
It's infallible.
I can always tell[br]a thoroughgoing bastard when I see one.
- Herr Oberst?[br]- (Radl) In here, Karl.
- Good morning.[br]- Good morning, Herr Oberst.
The material arrived from Starling.[br]It is truly excellent.
Starling is to be commended.
Ja. Ja, this is good.
What news of Oberst Steiner?
We're having difficulty[br]tracing him, Herr Oberst.
He's in Germany, but as to exactly where,[br]we've hit a roadblock, you know?
Even rumours of a court martial,[br]but we'll find him.
I'm sure. And now...
Here... a possible undercover operative.
I have decided on this man.[br]He's lecturing here in Berlin.
Send for him immediately.
- Yes.[br]- Oh, and Karl.
Send this message to Starling.
Yes, Herr Oberst.
- Where is Herr Oberst?[br]- In the map room, Herr Admiral.
This message has been sent out.[br]Did you originate it?
I did, Herr Admiral.
"Very interested[br]in your visitor of 6th November.
"Would like to drop some friends in[br]to persuade him to come back with them.
"Your comments expected by usual[br]route with all relevant information."
You've exceeded your authority.
You were told to prepare this feasibility[br]study, not embellish a joke.
With your permission,[br]it is no longer a joke. It could be done.
In my opinion, it should be done.
What if Churchill prefers to die?
What if abduction[br]becomes assassination?
No one specified dead or alive.
God in heaven!
Kill Churchill[br]when we've already lost the war?
I'm sure you've done a good job,[br]very thorough.
But this operation could make[br]the Charge of the Light Brigade look like a sensible military exercise.
Drop it.
Herr Oberst?
He has arrived.
(Irish accent) Come in,[br]Colonel... Radl, isn't it?
The top o' the morning to you.
It's not Irish whiskey,[br]but it'll do to be going on with.
Better for you to drink than me.
I have the feeling[br]I might be needing it. May I?
Ja.
The last time I was invited[br]up here to Section Three someone persuaded me[br]to jump out of a Dornier.
5,000 feet above Ireland, in the dark, and me with this terrible fear of heights!
You're planning a holiday to England,[br]are you?
They say that Brighton's[br]lovely this time of year.
- W-What the Christ is that?[br]- They're Russian.
I took to them in the Winter War.
They're probably all that[br]kept you awake in the snow.
Here... and here.
Now...
- I had a proposition for you, Mr Devlin.[br]- You had?
Have.
- I'm working, you know, Colonel.[br]- At the university.
For a man like you,[br]that's like a thoroughbred racing horse... finding himself...
- pulling a milk cart.[br]- You've got a way with words, Colonel.
You want me to go back to Ireland?
Well, I can't. They'd arrest me...
No, no. We don't want you to go back.
No. You're still a supporter[br]of the Irish Republican Army?
Soldier of, Colonel. Once in, never out.
But you're here in Germany[br]and not England, why?
I don't like soft target hits.
I don't want to live in Bayswater, mixing up explosives[br]in my landlady's saucepan to blow up a couple of passers-by.
My fight is with[br]the bloody British Empire and I'll fight it on my own two feet.
If it's some rabid fanatic you're after,[br]I'm the wrong man.
Am I right to assume your aim[br]is total victory against England?
No, that's your aim.[br]My aim is a united Ireland.
I appreciate the distinction[br]but Germany must win the war first.
Pigs might fly one day but I doubt it.
Mr Devlin.
- I want you to go to England for me.[br]- I barely know you.
To assist in the kidnapping[br]and safe return to Germany... of Winston Churchill.
Give me another Bolshevik[br]firecracker, will you?
I think I fell asleep in the snow.
- (Knock on door)[br]- Herr Oberst.
Good evening, Herr Oberst.
I am Sturmführer Toberg of the SS.
Reichsführer Himmler[br]presents his compliments and requests you to bring[br]the plan designated "Eagle".
When is that to be?
Now, Herr Oberst.
You seem nervous, Herr Oberst.
Please relax. Sit down.
May I smoke, Herr Reichsführer?
No.
A masterful job.
Thank you, Herr Reichsführer.
But, you know, some people[br]would say that such an operation could make[br]the Charge of the Light Brigade look like a sensible military exercise.
Have you heard that phrase before,[br]Herr Oberst?
I don't immediately recall,[br]Herr Reichsführer.
I know all about your plan.
I know what is written[br]on every single page.
Even the one you haven't got yet!
The court martial[br]of Herr Oberst Steiner and his men.
The arrogance of this Steiner is dazzling.
An unusual man this... er, this Steiner.
Intelligent, ruthless, a brilliant soldier... but above all, a romantic fool.
He threw away everything - rank, career... the future.
He is presently serving[br]in a penal colony on the island of... er... AIderney.
(Scoffs) All because[br]of some little Jewess whom he'd never[br]clapped eyes on before!
You know he's a veteran of[br]five successful commando raids?
Six, I believe.
Educated in England.
Speaks the language perfectly,[br]without an accent.
The ideal man for the job,[br]eh, Herr Oberst?
- If you think so, Herr Reichsführer.[br]- And so do you.
But the Herr Admiral Canaris[br]doesn't think so.
My loyalty to Herr Admiral...
Is exceeded only by your loyalty[br]to the Führer himself. Isn't that so?
I was sure of it.
Now, this Churchill business...
Our Führer wants it seen through.
You have considerable autonomy[br]in running your office.
You ought to be able to use it as an excuse to prevent Canaris[br]from knowing what's going on.
What kind of authority would I have to carry such a project through,[br]Herr Reichsführer?
Aloud, if you please.
"Herr Oberst Radl is acting[br]under my personal orders
"in a matter of the utmost[br]importance to the Reich.
"All personnel, military and civil,
"without distinction of rank,[br]will assist him in any way
"that Oberst Radl sees fit to demand.
"Adolf Hitler."
So you see, Radl, under the terms of that document, even I find myself[br]under your personal command.
Good luck.
I can only envy your inevitable[br]success in the matter.
- Heil Hitler.[br]- Heil Hitler.
Major Neuhoff, Commandant[br]of the island of Alderney.
- A distinct pleasure, Herr Oberst.[br]- Read this, please.
I see, Herr Oberst. What is your wish?
Terminate the penal unit here.
That applies to Steiner,[br]von Neustadt and the 29 men.
18, Herr Oberst. There are only 18 now.
The men are required to ride the[br]larger torpedo craft into enemy shipping.
- The torpedoes detach, of course?[br]- Of course.
- Most of the time.[br]- Burial detail, the usual letters of commendation.[br]And get the names right this time.
- Thank you, Herr Major.[br]- But...
Thank you, Herr Major.
- Herr Steiner?[br]- Yes, I'm Steiner. What is it?
My name is Radl.
Well, what is it? I have two men to bury[br]and no office to make small talk in.
Your credentials are hopelessly[br]impeccable, Herr Oberst.
What can I do for you?
Lead a raiding party to England[br]to kidnap Winston Churchill.
You don't seem impressed.
I haven't seen your plan yet.
Here.
While he's making his decision,
I'll go to that pub and think about mine.
The only time this plan makes[br]any sense to me is when I'm drunk.
- You are in command here?[br]- Oberleutnant Koenig, Herr Oberst.
These configurations[br]seem somewhat abnormal for an E-boat.
That's because she's a converted[br]British MTB, Herr Oberst.
Captured making a drop[br]off the Dutch coast.
- Morning.[br]- Sir.
You're familiar[br]with the east coast of England?
For five years I was First Mate[br]on a cargo ship out of England.
This could work, you know?
It will. It is a direct order[br]from the Führer himself.
I stood opposite Adolf once.
When he gave me this.
Oh, I forgot. One of those.
You're an officer.[br]You swore an oath, you have no choice.
Of course I do.
I'm going to die here anyway... eventually.
You forget, Radl, that I'm under[br]suspended sentence of death.
Officially disgraced.
I do not retain my rank... only my authority, because of the, er... peculiar circumstances of this job.
I offer you a chance[br]for reinstatement of rank and vindication for you and your men.
My men need no vindication.
- You said it could be done.[br]- It's possible.
Of all the world's leaders,
Churchill is probably the least protected, unlike the Führer.
Steiner, is thumbing[br]your nose at the Führer more important to you[br]than the lives of your men?
31 of you a few weeks ago.
How many are left?
Sixteen.
You owe them this last chance to live.
Or to die in England instead.
I will put it to my men.
They are entitled to know.
Only the destination for now - revealing[br]the target would be going too far.
I will put it to my men.
Steiner.
It may not win the war, but it would make them think[br]about negotiated peace. Hm?
A negotiated peace?
I will put that to my men also.
God bless all here.
- Give us a glass of your strongest.[br]- Gestapo.
So that's how the Gestapo dress[br]in Berlin these days?
- Gestapo?[br]- Drink?
I haven't sucked my thumb in years.
I wonder if you'd do it for me?
- Sir?[br]- Suck it.
Now, about your Mr... er, Devlin.
A man of considerable resource[br]and guile, I assure you.
Tell me something, Mr Devlin.[br]Just why are you coming along?
Can't you tell? I'm the last[br]of the world's great adventurers.
Sweet Mary, Mother of God.
Tough bunch of lads in there, Colonel!
What did he say?
Steiner insisted on[br]the unanimous consent of his men.
I'm not surprised.
If they agree, you'll leave tonight[br]for Southern Ireland.
- Close to the Ulster border.[br]- Tonight? What about my papers?
Your Irish passport and British[br]medical discharge have been provided.
Starling's found you a job.
You'll be a... marsh warden,[br]whatever that is.
It's a marsh warden.[br]What about the money?
- £10,000 first...[br]- No, I asked for £20,000.
10,000 has been deposited[br]in Geneva as per instructions.
Ten more[br]upon completion of the mission.
You think I'd sell out?
You've been so expensive[br]to buy in the first place.
You are going to jump in those clothes?
I might look a little bit silly[br]going down, Mr Steiner, but I'll be a lot safer[br]when I land on the ground.
There's an old poem which,[br]translated from the Irish, says,
"I realised fear one morning
"To the blare[br]of the fox hunters' sound
"When they're all chasing after[br]the poor bloody fox
"It's safer to be dressed like the hound"
You're quite literary.
If the truth be known, Colonel,[br]I'm a bloody literary genius.
- Your complete instructions.[br]- Right.
All of it - everything? No cyanide pill?
I couldn't conceive of a situation[br]which would force you to take one.
It's a little trick I learned[br]from my uncle in Belfast.
In the Middle Ages they would[br]have burned you for that.
Goodbye, Mr Devlin.[br]I will see you in England.
I'll be there.
- How do I jump out?[br]- Release your safety belt.
I turn the aircraft upside-down,[br]you drop out.
Has it occurred to you that[br]the signature on your authorisation could just be a forgery?
Why not fly to Berchtesgaden[br]and ask him yourself?
Let's not bother the man.
Mrs Joanna Grey?
- That's right.[br]- Liam Devlin.
I could do with a cup of tea.[br]It's been a hell of a journey.
Come inside.
That's a neat trick.
We're both Irish, your wolfhound and me.
- What's her name?[br]- Patch.
Oh, Patch, is it?
Sit down, Mr Devlin.
It's lovely, the countryside, isn't it?
You'd hardly know there was[br]a war on. Patch!
(Joanna) They're living[br]in a fool's paradise.
They lack the discipline[br]the Führer has brought to Germany.
These are papers you'll need.
I'll give you the ones they gave to me.
You know Sir Henry[br]is away for some time and only the servants[br]are in the manor house?
Does anyone else know[br]Churchill will be here?
Only Father Verecker.
Your duties, in the main,[br]will be merely gamekeeping.
You've got a motorbike parked outside[br]and you can have this shotgun.
It is loaded.
- You know the way to the cottage?[br]- Down the road, the pub's on the right, and I go through the manor house gates,[br]to the end of the lane.
Here's the keys.[br]Oh, petrol for the motorbike - the ration allowance is only[br]three gallons a month.
I hope I won't be here that long,[br]Mrs Grey.
They sent you over rather late.[br]Churchill arrives the day after tomorrow.
Colonel Radl sends his apologies,[br]there was nothing he could do about it.
This should be more than enough[br]for the vehicles we need.
I assume your contacts are reliable?
You take after me.
By the way, I would advise you[br]not to use stolen commercial petrol.
It contains a red dye...
Which comes out if you put it[br]through a gas mask. May I?
Oh, by all means.
To the English Enterprise.
I think you and I will get along famously.
On the contrary, Mr Devlin.
The success of the mission depends[br]entirely on the distance we keep.
(Man) Morning.
Walk on.
Good day to you, cailín.
- God save the good work.[br]- Oh, watch your back!
- My back?![br]- Mr Devlin.
Mr Devlin, is it?
Mrs Grey told us about you[br]at the last WVS meeting.
You're the new marsh warden.
And you're with[br]the Women's Voluntary Service.
I help out.
When I have the time.
Sort of erm... servicing the troops, is it?
I don't mind.
Miss, I do believe you're[br]a little bit of a tease.
Children tease, Mr Devlin,[br]and I am almost 19.
Go on. Go on.
God bless all here.
Can I have a glass[br]of your strongest, please?
- I'm George Wilde, the publican.[br]- Liam Devlin, marsh warden.
That's Arthur Seymour[br]and over by the fire, Laker Armsby.
Will you join me in a drink?
- A pint of bitter.[br]- Pint of bitter. Sir?
I buys me own.
Coming in here[br]with your shotgun and motorbike, buying drinks for us estate workers[br]who content themselves with less.
It can only be because of my good looks.
Make fun of me[br]and I'll squash you like a slug.
Arthur!
You walk soft around here.[br]You keep your place... and stay away from Molly Prior.
If I've caused any offence, I'm sorry.
Arthur, get out!
Today I leave, boy, but from now on,[br]when you see me, you leave.
One and nine, please.
- Good day, Father.[br]- Oh, good afternoon.
Liam Devlin - I'm Sir Henry's[br]new marsh warden.
- I'm just introducing myself around.[br]- I'm Father Verecker.
This is my sister Pamela, she's up[br]from Mildenhall on a weekend's leave.
- Your sister? How do you do?[br]- How do you do?
I'll be back for tea, Father.
- Goodbye, Mr Devlin.[br]- Goodbye.
We have a small[br]if loyal congregation here, Mr Devlin.
I look forward to your adding to it.
- You are Catholic?[br]- Oh, yes, Father.
- Did you come for confession?[br]- Oh, with apologies, Father, this poor soul is well past redemption.
God forgive me, but this confessional[br]could do with a few spicy revelations.
Don't forget the words of our Lord,[br]Mr Devlin - "The last shall be first."
In that case, I'm assured a place[br]at the head of the line.
(Steiner) Where did you find this?
(Radl) A DC3, captured almost intact.
- Gericke.[br]- Herr Oberst.
- Will it be ready in time?[br]- No problem.
Where did she go? Eh?
All right, my friend.
(Molly) What kept you?
"What kept me," is it?[br]Why, you little devil!
My God, and I'll know you till[br]Doomsday, that's for sure.
- What does that mean?[br]- It's an expression from where I come.
- You use these?[br]- No.
Good for you. They stunt your growth.
You with your green years[br]still ahead of you.
Almost 19, eh?
- What month?[br]- February.
- 25th?[br]- 22nd.
But I was right, you're a little fish.
We should get along well -[br]me being a Scorpio.
Never marry a Virgo.
Virgo and Pisces never hit it off.
Take Arthur, for example.
I think he's Virgo, watch it with him.
Arthur? Arthur Seymour? Are you crazy?
No, but I think he is.
Pure, clean, virtuous... and not very hot - that's a Virgo.
Ah, it's a terrible shame[br]from where I'm lying.
You'll have a weight problem[br]if you don't watch your food.
Bastard!
Are you laughing at me?
What else would you have me[br]do with you, Molly Prior?
Don't answer that.
How do you know my name?
George Wilde told me at the pub.
Oh, I see!
- And Arthur, was he there?[br]- You could say that.
I get the feeling that he looks upon you[br]as his personal property.
He can go to hell - I belong to no man.
Your nose turns up.
And when you get angry,[br]your mouth turns down at the corners.
I'm sure you could find a hundred things[br]wrong with me... a thousand!
But you wouldn't throw me[br]out of your bed on a wet Saturday night.
That's men for you -[br]anything's better than nothing.
Wait! Come here!
You don't know the first thing about me.
Because if you did,[br]you'd know that I much prefer a warm autumn afternoon[br]under the pines... to a wet Saturday night, any day.
The sand has a terrible way[br]of getting where it shouldn't be.
Get out of here, before I let[br]my mad passion run away with me.
Go on, get! Get!
They told me all Irishmen were crazy... now I believe them.
- I'll be at Mass on Sunday, will you?[br]- Do I look like I will?
Yes. I think you do.
Oh, Devlin, you bloody idiot.
You never learn.
Never bloody learn.
It is out there, Hans.
160 miles west.
We've been on tough ones before.
The kidnapping[br]of the British prime minister.
If successful, will be a shot in the arm[br]for German morale.
But I agree. It won't stop the bombers[br]from making their daily runs.
The men considered that[br]before they agreed to go.
The men, as I once remarked[br]to a certain Gruppenführer in Poland, feel a loyalty to me.
Which, God help me,[br]I may merely be taking advantage of.
You tell me, Hans.[br]Is it a legitimate mission or have I simply agreed[br]to an elaborate way of killing myself and taking all of you with me?
There is Radl's point -[br]of a negotiated peace.
Hm, a negotiated peace.
I laughed when he said that.
But supposing he's right, hm?
But then negotiated on behalf of whom?
On behalf of the men who lead us or on behalf of Germany as a whole,[br]as she will be one day?
The Gruppenführer from Poland will be[br]part of the Germany she will be one day.
So, by God, will we.
Mother of God.
Look at that now.
- What kept you?[br]- Very clever.
After I came back to make sure[br]you put the pie in the oven.
- But then I suppose you've eaten.[br]- Just get the pie into the oven.
That's better.
- What's this?[br]- Trinity College, Dublin.
- Football?[br]- Art and literature.
- What are you reading?[br]- Some poetry.
- Read it.[br]- "Read it", is it?
- It's a foreign language.[br]- Irish, the language of the kings.
It's very beautiful.[br]Liam - is that Irish too?
- Yes.[br]- What does it mean?
- William.[br]- No, I think I prefer Liam.
- William is so ordinary.[br]- Jesus, Joseph and Mary heed me.
- What does that mean?[br]- It means that if you don't get the pie,
I won't be responsible.
Oh, I do like you, do you know that?
From the first moment I saw you,[br]Mr Devlin, sitting astride your bike.
The pie.
- Pie's not ready yet.[br]- How did you get it here?
- This morning.[br]- Oh.
- Read.[br]- "Read", is it?
Give me that book over there,[br]the blue one.
Sit down.
I'll read you the end of this.
"And then I asked him[br]with my eyes to ask again yes
"and then he asked me would I yes
"to say yes my mountain flower
"and first I put my arms around him yes
"and drew him down to me so he could[br]feel my breasts all perfume yes
"and his heart was going like mad
"and yes I said yes I will Yes."
- Is that Irish too?[br]- Yes.
Himmler sends personal wishes[br]for success from the Führer himself.
You've altered the parachutes. Why?
Unfortunately, we have high tide[br]at first light when we must drop.
So we may land in the surf.
These slots enable us to guide the chute.
It's experimental and the landing[br]velocity is high, but we have no choice.
I assume they've been tested.
Jawohl, Herr Oberst.
I have one request.
A demand, actually.
Blackmail at this point, hm?
We are not spies and will not be treated[br]as such by the British if anything goes wrong.
We will wear our own uniforms[br]under the Polish outfits and if necessary, we will fight[br]and die as what we are -
German paratroopers.
Max, it is not a subject for negotiation.
- In that case, agreed.[br]- Thank you.
Hello, Liam.
My compliments on the dress.
It's a great improvement.
Why pick on me?
Because you're lovely, because[br]you could never fall in love with me.
But I might... just for spite.
It wouldn't matter -[br]I could never fall in love with you.
I'm bad for you, we've no future.
I'm not telling you that[br]to make you want me more. It's the truth.
I'm here - your turn to leave.
(Sighs) Oh, God.
Arthur, did I ever tell you[br]about the uncle I've got in Belfast?
Of course I didn't.
He was a bare-knuckle boxer.
I'm just telling him about the Holy Trinity.
You know it?
Footwork, timing and hitting.
And a little bit of dirty work.
"Learn these," my uncle would say.
"You'll inherit the earth like the meek."
You never know when to lie down.
Liam!
Well, Arthur, looks like[br]he bought you a drink after all!
I told you not to come here tonight.
I wanted you to come home[br]to a proper fire.
When I went to the wood bin[br]I found those.
Now put it back, there's a good girl.
What is it?
What does it mean?
Molly, my own sweetheart,[br]I love you dearly, but any more games like this and I'll give you[br]the thrashing of your life.
Size ten. Was I right?
Silk stockings.
Real silk.
Where did you get these?
You can get anything...[br]if you know where to look.
Black market.
That's what it is.
Why can't you be nice and normal?
Would you have me in my grave[br]so early?
Now go get the tea.
Or do you want to report me[br]to the police?
Oh, Liam.
It's perfect...
- but which way is England?[br]- (Laughs)
You. Tell Oberst Radl who you are.
Kapral Andrzej Jankowski.
You.
Kapral Stanislav Kunicki,[br]as you very well know.
Get back in line.
I'm very much impressed.
You know, it all started as a joke,[br]an insane joke.
I hope that Winston Churchill[br]appreciates our sense of humour.
- Good luck, Steiner.[br]- Thank you, Max.

Well... what do you think his game is?
Black market... or worse?
There's two army trucks outside[br]without numbers on... yet.
This... German.
It's worse!
Arthur, if you love me,[br]don't breathe a word until...
I'll have that bastard[br]arrested within the hour.
I've never meant to tease you.[br]I know I have, but I never meant to.
- You lying tart.[br]- I love him, Arthur.
What you do to him, you do to me.
You can both rot in hell.
Stop, Arthur!
I won't let you go!
Susan?

[Man Narrating]
Ayear ago-
Ayear ago yesterday, as a matter of fact, they brought David Fielding to the hospital.
He'd been hit by a car when he was yelling his head off about "the forces of evil."
They were out to get him, he said.
Nutty stuff. The kind of thing that happens to people's minds sometimes.
But when the police started checking...
they found three bodies and another guy was missing-
a Dr. Watermann, a kind of weirdo professor at the university.
I covered the story for my paper...
but I couldn't come up with any satisfactory angle.
- [Reporter] Is that David?
- [Doctor] Yes, it is.
- Where's he been?
- Electrotherapy.
He's been a complete depressive since my first interview with him a year ago.
So, as I told you on the telephone,
I'm afraid you're in for a disappointment.
[Reporter]
Yeah, I suppose so.
But I wanted to give it another try, see if anything new had developed in the last year.
The case is so bizarre, it kind of fascinates me.
And, frankly, things are kind of slow in the news business.
What do you do with a guy in that shape?
[Doctor] At this point we're looking for anything that will elicit a response...
some reaction to give us a starting point for therapy.
We administer mild electric shock, stimulants.
And this little room down here, it's something new.
I'll show you.
It has one red wall and a light switch.
He can choose to turn the light on or off, either face the red wall or turn his back to it.
- So, what does he do?
- He has yet to do anything ofhis own volition.
The only thing he pays any attention to is that little cross he carries.
He got violent when the police tried to examine the cross.
We had to put him under sedation.
Since then he's been a complete melancholic.
If he's faking, could he possibly get away with it?
Please, Mr. Sloan, be aware that conjectures about illness and the human mind... are the province of the psychiatrist.
David, you have a visitor.
The intercom is on, Mr. Sloan.
We can hear you, if you need us.
Thanks.
I won't be long.
[Door Closes]
How are you feeling, David?
Uh, what's the, uh, cross for?
To protect you from the curse?
Dave, I've got something to show you.
[Gasps]
- [Roaring]
- [Screaming]
- [Grunts] Hey!
- [Alarm Ringing]
Get- Get him off of me!
Get him off!
- Here. This will make you feel better.
- [Groans]
- I thought you said he was the quiet type.
- Yes, well, you never know.
[David Grunting, Groaning]
No!
[Grunting, Muttering]
- All right, thank you, Nurse.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, uh, here's the cross.
Somehow I wound up with it.
My cross!
[Grunting]
- I hope I didn't mess up your therapy, Doc.
- We'll see.
This is the tape I made the day after they brought David in.
- The one the cops had?
- That's right. This is a copy.
[Tape: Doctor]
June 18. Initial interview with David Fielding.
David, I am Dr. Johansen.
Do you remember me?
We met yesterday down in Receiving.
Well, I'm not surprised if you don't.
You were pretty upset.
You kept insisting that someone was after you.
You said "they" were going to kill you.
Who are "they,"David?
Now, we're all here to help you, David.
We all want to help you.
This gentleman is Detective Harris.
Hello, David.
We can't help you if you won't let us, David.
I think you're well enough to tell us about it.
Why don't you try?
[Exhales]
I -
All right.
I'll try.
I suppose...
I've got to tell someone... even if they think I'm crazy.
How did it start, David?
Saturday...
I got a call from Dr. Watermann.
[Johansen]
Who is Dr. Watermann?
[David]
He was my geology professor.
[Johansen]
And why did he phone you?
[David]
Wanted to see me right away.
His mountain cabin.
Something important.
Jim Hudson was with me.
I asked ifhe could come along.
He said okay.
I told him we'd be there the next afternoon.
[Johansen] There were two girls with you, weren't there?
Yeah. Jim's girlfriend, Vicki, had a picnic planned.
They decided to keep it on.
Didn't tell me till the last minute.
Even had a blind date for me.
[Johansen] So there was Jim and Vicki.
And what was your blind date's name?
[David]
Susan. Susan Turner.
She was just out here from New York.
I was worried the professor wouldn't like it.
[Johansen]
Why, David?
[David]
Well, he sounded so strange.
Kind of mysterious...
and, well, nervous.
[Johansen]
Did you explain this to your friends?
[David]
Yeah, I told Jim.
He said the girls could wait in the car if necessary.
We took my car and drove into the mountains.
- Would you change that awful station, Susan.
- [Radio: Frequencies Tuning]
- % % % [Radio: P op]
- And then here's the shutter.
You press this button and it takes the picture.
Last picnic you brought your camera and then forgot all about that.
Now you've probably forgot to load the camera.
- Uh-uh. No. Not this time.
- [Sarcastic Chuckle]
- [Jim] You sure this is the right road?
- [David] Yeah, I think so.
- % % [Radio Off]
- [Engine Off]
[Jim]
Looks like we took the wrong road.
Maybe we didn't.
We might have to walk to get there.
Dr. Watermann's place is in the woods a little ways.
Why don't we walk up there and see if we can get a Coke.
We ought to let Dave see Dr. Watermann, since we don't know what his plans are.
- Water jug's in the car.
- What'd you put in it?
Nothing. I thought you were supposed to put something in it.
- I thought you were. Why was I supposed to -
- I don't believe it.
Come on.
We'll go see.
[Susan]
It's very pretty up here.
[Vicki] Yeah. Great place for a picnic with nothing to drink.
With all these trees around here, there should be a stream somewhere.
[David]
There is-near the cabin.
- Watch your step.
- Oh!
Oh, darn.
- Jim
- Wow!
- What happened?
- Is that Dr. Watermann's cabin?
An explosion.
Stove or water heater, maybe.
No, it's caved-in, not blown-out.
Doesn't look like he was there when it happened.
No signs of life.
Think I'll go up -
Can I help you?
Oh. Hello.
You the ranger here?
That's right.
Name's Asmodeus.
You looking for someone?
Yeah - Dr. Watermann.
That was his cabin.
What happened to it?
I'm not sure.
Could have been a boulder from up above.
Have you seen Dr. Watermann?
Are you friends of his?
- Yeah. We had an appointment today.
- He's not here.
I haven't seen him.
Anything I can do for you?
No, thank you.
We brought a picnic.
I guess we'll have it and go back to town.
Well, have fun.
See you later.
You'll probably find Dr. Watermann back in town.
[David]
Right. Thank you.
Where's Vicki?
Hey, what are you do -
Hey, tell me I don't see that.
- [Susan] A castle!
- [Jim] I asked you not to tell me that
I've only been here once, and I'm not sure it's the same area.
But I sure never saw or heard of a castle.
Far out. Looks like a picture on a travel folder.
Yeah, for Transylvania.
- Let's go take a look at it.
- Yeah!
- How the heck do we get there?
- We can hike over that way and take a look.
Might be an entrance on the other side, but it's too far.
This side's too steep for the girls to climb.
Would like to get to it though.
It might be where Dr. Watermann is.
Well, doesn't cost anything to try.
- Susan?
- I'm with you.
This is the best way.
See the road?
- Some picnic, huh?
- [Laughter Reverberating]
It came from in there!
In the cave!
[Laughter Continues]
[Laughter Continues]
- [Flapping Sound]
- [Laughter Continues]
What -
[Flapping Sound Continues]
- What was that?
- How should I know?
[Jim]
Anyone wanna go in there?
[David] Well, I'd like to, if we had some way to see.
- Have you got a flashlight in the car?
- No, I haven't.
Matches.
All right, we'll -
- We'll make some torches.
- Torches. All right.
[Gasps]
Hey! Come here!
Come on!
[Jim]
Hey, babe, what do you got here?
Well, look at this.
[Jim]
What a pair of gun boats.
You're a geologist, Dave.
What do you think?
Ever unearth anything like this?
[Chuckles]
I think what we're about to unearth... is a practical joker who plants phony footprints... and makes weird noises in caves to put people on.
[Jim] Now, watch your step.
There's a lot of junk in here.
[Vicki]
Yeah. There's something right here.
[Jim]
Well, come on, dummy.
That's why I gave you the torch - so you wouldn't break your neck.
[Vicki]
Well, my eyes haven't adjusted yet.
[Jim]
Just take your time.
[Gasps]
Jim? Jim?
Jim!
Dave?
Jim?
- [Laughing]
- [Screams]
- [Jim] Vicki!
- [Vicki]Jim!
- [David] Where are you?
- [Laughing Continues]
[Vicki]
Jim! Where are you?
[David] This way, Jim!
Down this way!
[Jim]
Vicki! Where are you?
- [Laughing Continues]
- [Vicki Screams] Oh, Jim, hurry!
[Jim] We're coming, Vicki!
Stay where you are!
[Vicki]Jim, no!
You're getting farther away!
[David]
Dead end! Turn back!
[Jim] This is the right one, Dave.
To the left! Here! Around this bend!
[David]
Don't get too far in front of me, Jim!
[Laughing Continues]
[Vicki]
Oh, Jim! Jim!
- Vicki!
- Oh, Jim, Jim!
- Are you all right, babe?
- Who the heck are you?
The book.
That's what you're after.
- We aren't looking for a book.
- [Cackling]
You're here.
You have to take it.
[Cackling Continues]
Come on. Come on.
Wow, is this weird.
Well, let's follow him.
[Chuckles]
This way.
[Cackling Continues]
[Susan] Do you really think we ought to follow him?
Well, it can't hurt us.
[Cackling]
Come on. Come on.
Here it is.
[Cackling Continues]
The book.
The real book!
Now it's your book.
Take it!
Don't you want it back?
[Cackling Continues]
Jim. Jim, there was a skeleton in there.
- Don't you think-
- A skeleton?
- What's this about a skeleton?
- I saw one in there, just before the old man -
- What kind of skeleton?
- Human!
Oh, come on. You didn't see a human skeleton. It was just -
Don't tell me what I didn't see.
It was right in front of me.
In that torchlight? It was probably some animal or some rocks or-
- It was human.
- Well, we could go back and see.
- Oh, not this kid.
- No matches.
We'll tell somebody back in town about it and let them take care of it. Okay?
- All right. Feeling better?
- Boy, I'd love to get this book open.
Well, let's have the picnic and examine the book.
- Okay. You hungry?
- Frankly, I'm starved.
But let's do find a more wholesome atmosphere.
I can't believe that crazy old man has really been living in that cave.
- Yeah. Looked like he was.
- How do you suppose he exists in there?
Doubt if we'll ever know.
Well, I took care of the beverage.
Fresh mountain stream water.
And I just hope you can cook chicken.
I'll have you know my chicken is of world renown.
- Voilà!
- Saved by the colonel.
Look at this.
Yeah, must be that pioneer stock in your background.
Ohh.
- Lunch time.
- No, I wanna get this open first.
You're sure fighting that thing.
The old man neglected to give us the key.
Would you like to go back and ask him for it?
Mmm. Here.
Try this.
Well, well.
We brought a Boy Scout with us.
Yes, we did.
Wait - Now, wait - Now, be c -
You're gonna break the point off that thing!
Let me do it. Okay?
Here, catch.
Aah!
Yeah? Yeah? All right.
- [Clicks]
- Think I got it.
Pretty clever. No springs.
Just two interlocking links.
Okay, okay.
Open it, Jim.
- [Gasps]
- Whew!
- Wow.
- Whew!
What a stink.
Where'd he keep this thing, in a sewer?
- Smells more like rotten eggs - sulfuric.
- Yeah.
Hey, what's this?
- Well, what is it?
- Somebody's notes.
Well, what's it say?
Hmm.
"Unknown preservative."
Talks about the excellent condition of the book.
A couple of chemicals that might be involved.
Very knowledgeable.
Very scientific.
So?
So, if this is more of the old man's put-on, at least it's getting more interesting.
Hey, I didn't make all this stuff for the ants!
She didn't make all that for the ants.
Okay. Be right there.
If the smell of this book doesn't make me lose my appetite.
Huh.
Look at this character.
- How about that?
- Yeah.
Wow. This is some piece of literature.
Only it's gonna be a little difficult to follow the story without a translation.
Come on, you guys.
Let's have our picnic and go see that castle.
A lot more interesting than some smelly old book.
Dear heart, why don't you dummy up.
She's right, Jim. We should try to find out where Dr. Watermann is.
We can examine the book later.
Okay.
All right. Who made the potato salad?
Joe's Delicatessen?
- [Vicki] I made it myself.
- Then I'll stick with the chicken.
Say, here's something I can read.
Pretty well anyway- it's in Latin.
"Nema.
"Forever glory the and" -
Must mean "and the."
"Power the and kingdom... the is thou thine."
Yeah?
"The is thine"?
"Kingdom the is thine."
Hey, wait a minute.
Don't read any more.
I know what that is.
That's the Lord's Prayer backwards.
[Vicki] You know, I still keep thinking about that skeleton.
[Jim] Oh, boy. Well, it's nice you have something to occupy your mind.
[Vicki Chuckles Sarcastically]
Come on, Dave.
- Hey!
- What happened?
- Dr. Watermann!
- You sure?
Yeah. I got a glimpse of him.
He has the book!
You stay here.
Dr. Watermann!
Dr. - Dr. Watermann!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.
- What happened?
- Must have hit his head on a rock.
I can't feel any-
Jim, he's dead.
I can't believe it.
It was just a fall.
Dave, are you sure?
Yes, yes, I'm sure.
I've seen dead bodies before.
Come on.
Let's get him out of the water.
We'll go back and tell the girls, and we'll go to the police and make a report.
Dave, listen.
I know you and Dr. Watermann were close... but you can't blame yourself for his death.
It was an accident.
The way he ran from us -
He did it himself. Now, it's not exac -
Where you goin'?
He's gone!
This is the place.
If he got up, there would have been footprints.
It's as though he just... disappeared.
Yeah.
If anyone else were here, we would have seen them, wouldn't we?
I think so.
Those footprints are our own.
Dave, a minute ago
Dr. Watermann was lying here dead.
And now he's gone.
Flesh, bones, blood - all are gone.
If he really was dead.
Sulfuric acid.
Can you smell the sulfur?
Yeah, but what does that mean?
He burned up in a bed of sulfur?
Lose something?
- [Horse Snorts]
- Uh, hi there.
- Say, have you seen Dr. Watermann?
- No, I'm afraid not.
Thought we agreed he was back in town.
- Well, he was just here -
- Uh, he was just here yesterday when he phoned.
We wondered if you'd seen him since then.
No. If he were around here,
I think I'd know it.
- Did you have your picnic yet?
- Yeah. Back there.
I'd like to ask you to leave the area like you found it, if you will.
People camp and picnic around here, and they sometimes leave an awful mess.
- Yes, sir. We cleaned up.
- You'd never know we were there.
By the way, in a cave back up that way... we ran into some weird old character and a book, and it has this -
Yeah, he was a weird old character right out of a book, like he said.
- He gave us quite a scare at first.
- [Sighs] That cave. I should have warned you.
That place is really dangerous.
You shouldn't go in there.
Well, we're about ready to leave anyway.
Well, there were some footprints - really big, like nothing you ever saw before.
Like a monster or something.
"Monster."
Well, there used to be a few brown bears around here, maybe an occasional mountain lion... but I'm afraid we're fresh out of monsters.
It was probably that crazy old man's idea of a joke.
Maybe I'll just look in on your friend.
[Clicks Tongue]
[Asmodeus]
See you later.
[Jim]
Right.
Oh, I forgot to ask him about the castle.
What are you gonna do now?
I just wanna think about it for a minute.
Listen, if those guys start yakking with Dr. Watermann or somebody... we could still be here this time tomorrow.
I think we oughta find them.
Well, they might come back a different way and we could miss them.
I'll stay here, if you wanna go ahead and find them.
Okay, you hold the fort.
I'll bring them right back... by the ears.
Okay, okay, I can understand not telling him about Dr. Watermann.
But why shouldn't I have mentioned the book?
It may be an important find.
I just don't think we should advertise it.
But what's a ranger going to do with an old book?
Jim, I don't know!
I just wanna try and figure out this Dr. Watermann thing.
Well, the girls are going to be frantic, and I think we ought to get back to them.
All right. Let's go.
Hey, listen, man, this thing is getting pretty far out.
You think Dr. Watermann was sick or anything?
I don't know of any chronic condition
Dr. Watermann might have had... that could have put him in a catatonic coma like that to make him appear dead.
That kind of stuff is out of my league.
I wouldn't know a catatonic coma if it bit me.
Have you thought of anybody back in town you could talk to? Do you know who his doctor is?
No, but if we don't find him ourselves, we'll have to tell the police, and they'll do all that.
[Whinnies]
Oh, Mr. Asmodeus.
You startled me.
What are you doing?
[David]
Susan!
Susan?
- Susan, are you all right?
- Oh, David.
- Yes, I'm fine.
- What happened?
I don't know.
L-l-I guess I just fell.
Here.
You'd better sit down.
- What's this?
- Oh, my cross.
I guess I've broken the chain.
I'm all right, really.
Susan, something's happened, something really strange.
We were chasing Dr. Watermann, and he fell, and we thought he was dead.
We were gonna go back to town and call the police, but I just couldn't leave him there.
So we went back, and he was gone.
- Gone? But -
- l-I don't know.
I don't have a single theory.
I've never known him to do anything strange, like the way he took that book and ran.
Could be brain damage or a mental disorder of some kind.
Or, uh, maybe he was in that house when it was wrecked.
That's the only thing that could explain his behavior-some mental aberration.
He might even be suffering from-
- Here's Dr. Watermann's name!
- What?
I found this piece of paper in the book with his name on it.
Well, what does it say?
Wow, listen to this.
It's Dr. Watermann, all right.
It's his notes about this book.
"Translation goes along smoothly...
"then completely bogs down as the book indiscriminately changes languages.
"I believe tests will prove the book to be a thousand years old.
"Not as old as the Dead Sea Scrolls, and evidently from the opposite camp.
[David Continues Reading]
"Absorbed in the difficult task of translation...
"I was at first unaware of the meaning of this rare and unique text.
"It seems to be a veritable bible of evil...
"or witchcraft or demonism...
"as it was practiced in a remote area of the Persian Gulf...
"where the book was found.
[David Continues Reading]
"From the time I first laid hands on the book...
"I heard nothing but rumors and vague warnings of its danger...
"all from the superstitious people of the area.
"Quite different than anything else I have seen...
"it approaches the subject very methodically as an absolute...
"as though its doctrines were widely practiced in its era and place.
[No Audible Dialogue]
"I have also found the philosophy of the book...
"to be fascinating...
"considering its ancient origin.
"The forces of good and evil coexist...
"throughout the universe and in the minds of men.
"The object of each force...
"and its practitioners...
"is to lessen or cancel, as much as possible...
"the effectiveness of the opposite force.
"The adept demonologist held a position ofhigh honor.
"The practice of evil and destruction...
"is put forward as a joy and reward in itself.
"The practitioners of evil who compiled this book...
"used symbols to counteract the effectiveness of good.
"Many combinations of symbols for both forces are listed...
"however, as the practitioner needed certain symbols of good...
"to protect himself...
"from the demons he brought forth and created...
"manipulation of these symbols...
"is treated exactly like the science of chemistry.
"This element changes that one.
"One symbol is a catalyst, another is an agent or a counteractant.
"Strangely enough, in the list of symbols for good...
"are some very familiar ones.
"The cross and the double-triangled
Star of David, if made of certain metals...
"are among them.
Hmm.
"In actual practice, of course...
"the science of demonology, as outlined in the book...
"is much more complicated than I have indicated here -
"which brings me to the point where I now stand.
"In full scientific skepticism...
"but with much personal curiosity...
"I have set up and executed some experiments...
"as diagrammed in the book.
"In a nearby secluded area,
I followed, to the best of my knowledge...
"the instructions for some of the simpler manifestations...
"the last of which produced fantastic results.
"It worked.
"I felt as though I had found the fabled touchstone.
"I could see myself changing the entire structure of modern science.
"More recently, however,
I've come to feel that my experiments...
"were somewhat premature of my knowledge on the subject.
"There is instability.
I am unable to control what I have created."
There's some other writing here that looks like a scrawl.
"Pandora's box"?
Uh, "They are attracted to the book... like flies."
No, l-I - I can't read it.
That's pretty heavy stuff.
Well, what do you make of it, Dave?
I don't know. Unless we talk to Dr. Watermann, we may never know.
Well, so what are we gonna do now?
I'd still like to try that castle.
Uh, you don't think he's still up there, do you?
Jim, I don't know, but if we can't find Dr. Watermann...
I'd like to at least find someone who's seen or talked to him lately, okay?
Okay.
[Vicki Sighs]
- It's gone!
- This is the place, isn't it?
- I think so.
- Yes! Yes, it is!
It was right over there when I saw it.
Okay, okay.
Try to maintain, will you?
Well, what now, maestro?
Looks like we have to give some credence to Dr. Watermann's notes, don't we?
- Huh?
- He means we have to believe in him now.
Let's go up there, Jim, and see if we can find anything.
Okay. It's pretty steep.
You girls wait here.
Now, wait a minute.
Uh, you guys may enjoy this open-air magic show, but I'm gettin' the creeps!
Take it easy, love. We're okay.
Come on!
Can't we just go home?
We can, but if we leave here without trying to find out what's going on...
I, for one, am going to feel very foolish when we tell our story back in town.
Uh, speak for yourself, Sir Lancelot.
Hey. Hey, look. Here in the book, in Dr. Watermann's notes... he says there were symbols that protect a person from - from whatever.
Let's see. Susan has a cross. Does anyone else have a cross or a Star of David?
- No.
- Well, let's see what we can find.
Here it is.
- Here's one we can make.
- [David] How?
- Some willow twigs.
- That's neat.
- Your major was basket weaving.
- [Chuckles] Yes.
Put them inside your shirts.
They have to be next to your body.
Gee, I feel kind of left out.
Bless you, my child.
If the rest of us weren't such heathens,
I wouldn't have had to go to all this trouble.
Well, you can thank me for the thread that's holding them together.
Now I just hope I don't fall apart.
I don't know. Seems like a pretty nice place to start a nudist colony.
[Chuckles]
Keep your eye on that, will you?
Hold that.
Hey, look.
Don't horse around up there, okay?
Just do your thing long enough to feel real manly... and then let's get out of here, please?
Boy, you could grow up to be a real fussbudget.
Look, promise me you'll be a good girl... and don't get Susan all upset too, all right?
[Sighs]
Well, what are we gonna do now?
Find a comfortable rock, sit back and wait for them.
Watch those yucca spines.
They stick like crazy.
Just around that cliff.
Hey, come on.
I'll take your picture.
- Are you sure you know how to use it?
- Yeah. Jim showed me how.
- Okay.
- The light's not very good here.
Why don't you sit over by the stream?
No, not here. Get out! Get out!
[Growling]
I ain't got it, I told ya!
No! No!
It was about - about 20 feet from here, wasn't it?
I think so.
That's the first live thing I've seen around here all day.
Hey! Dave!
Come here.
- This is it. Hold it. Can you see it?
- See what? What are you talking about?
Wait. I'll show you. Watch this.
Watch what?
What in the -
I can see it now.
Dr. Watermann's notes - the instability.
This thing must fluctuate.
Wow! Davey boy, figure this one out, and our fortune is made in showbiz.
The Rover Boys and their disappearing castle.
- Now you see it, now you don't.
- I wonder if that castle's still there.
Yeah. And/or Dr. Watermann.
[Vicki]
There you are.
Is that okay?
Okay, now, just a second.
Help! Save me. Help me. Help me!
Help!
[Grunts]
- [Growling]
- No! Help! Help me!
[Screaming]
Ow!
[Screaming]
The girls!
[Roars]
Throw rocks!
Get his attention!
[Growling]
[Whimpering]
Susan, help!
Keep it up.
I'll go after the girls.
[Dave]
Jim!
Over here!
[Screaming]
Try to find a long stick.
[Growling]
I got it!
[Roaring]
Hold it. You go up on top.
Throw rocks down, try to get his attention.
- [Gasping]
- [Grunting]
- Get back! Get back!
- [Whimpers]
Wait there.
- Dave?
- What happened? Where is he?
There. He's not moving.
I think you killed him.
Better go see.
[Jim]
My God! Whose nightmare is that thing?
That's a whole lifetime of nightmares.
Dave, did you notice?
One of the pictures in the book- it looks like this thing.
Yeah. I wonder if that's one of Dr. Watermann's experiments that went haywire.
That poor old man!
Jim, that thing!
- Oh, it killed the old man from the cave!
- What?
It was chasing him when we saw it.
It - It caught him.
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
No. No, first we have to take care of the old man's body.
Then we'd better notify the authorities.
Oh, can't we just tell that ranger and let him take care of it?
Yeah, if we knew where to find him.
We don't even know where the station is.
Yeah, and that ranger would try to tell us it was Smokey the Bear.
They're gonna sure think we're crazy when we tell 'em about this thing.
My camera!
I'll get it and take a picture.
Good.
Oh, darn.
- [Quiet Growl]
- [Screams]
Jim, the hand - it moved!
Must have been a reflex or something.
It's dead, honey. We're safe.
I'll go this way.
Now, I'll take a picture and meet you later.
- I don't like all this splitting up.
- No, no, no. This is the quickest way.
Now, you go with Dave and Sue and see about that old man... and help take the picnic gear back to the car, hear?
Boy, I knew you'd find a way to get out of all the work.
[Twig Snapping]
- It was around here someplace, wasn't it?
- Yeah, it was right over there, I think.
Uh, I'd better go alone.
[Sighs]
I just don't believe this day.
You know, I keep thinking that pretty soon I'll wake up-
- [Susan Growling]
- [Vicki Whimpering]
[Growling Continues]
[Gasping]
[Screaming]
- [Growls]
- Susan! Vicki! What -
[Sobbing]
She's gone crazy. She's an animal.
Hello!
Anybody here?
It's a shame, isn't it? I mean, the way people mess up the countryside like that.
- Mr. Asmodeus, I was just looking for you -
- Yeah, well, I was just looking for you too, kid.
- You people have the book, don't you?
- Wh-Wh-Wh -
You have the book, and you're going to give it to me.
Huh?
If you knew what was in that book, you'd turn to jelly.
It's not meant for worms like you.
What'd you think you were going to do with it?
Sell it to a museum?
Why didn't you tell me you had-
[Screaming] Damn! Heaven!
[Sighs]
All right.
I underestimated you.
Put it away. You're safe.
Put it away.
[Sighs]
Whew.
I gotta hand it to you, kid.
Not many people could've come up with that.
So we'll make a deal, huh?
Let me tell you - I can make a deal like nobody you ever saw.
- Who are you?
- It's not who I am.
It's what I can do for you.
What do you want?
Anything in the world. Name it.
Money? Prestige? Girls?
You could have all the things you've ever dreamed of.
You want proof.
Well, let's see. There oughta be some proof walking around here somewhere.
Or maybe you've seen him - my large simian friend, the 30-foot ape?
I see you have.
Let me tell you, kid, the supply is limitless.
Now, if I can create creatures like that... you know I can fulfill my promise.
All you have to do is give me the book... and discredit any story your friends tell back in town... and you can have anything in this world you want.
Why is that book so important to you?
Listen, kid!
You've got some protection right now... but don't think that can save you.
You've been lucky so far, but I haven't tried yet.
So make up your mind!
Which one of those girls is yours?
The tall one?
The other one.
Well, I haven't got to her yet, but I will.
You better think fast, kid.
Take my offer, or you and your friends are as good as dead.
All the money you ever want, kid!
[Hysterical Laughing]
It'll be all right.
Susan, remember what Dr. Watermann said in his notes?
He said that good and evil coexist throughout the universe... and in everybody's mind.
No. Not what was in my mind.
Nobody has thoughts, feelings like that.
Nobody human anyway.
Listen, what was done can be undone, if you have the knowledge.
And we have it, or we will have with the book.
That man- That whatever he is... how could he do a thing like this?
Dave, I didn't even remember it until just now.
Well, maybe that's a good sign.
- Oh, damn!
- Here, let me help you.
Oh, it's no use!
It'll just break.
Where's Jim?
We've got to get out of here!
Take it easy, Vicki. Jim will be back.
He has to come this way.
Vicki, any one symbol or Susan's cross... will protect the entire group from - from whatever.
- It's only when we separate that we're -
- Oh, yeah?
Then why'd you spend all that time trying to find Susan's cross?
- You've got a symbol.
- Well, take my symbol.
No. I don't know what I'm saying.
Take care of Susan.
- Oh, Vicki, I'm so -
- Don't apologize again, Susan. Please!
I'm all right.
Look, it wasn't your-
Oh, God. I've gotta find Jim!
Vicki!
Vicki, stop!
Stop! We've gotta stick together.
If you run afterJim, we'll lose him.
He'll be back this way.
[Sobbing]
David, I'm so scared!
We're gonna make it, Vicki.
He'll be along.
He'll be all right, Vicki.
I'm sorry. Susan, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to make it worse for you.
- Here comes Jim.
- Oh, Jim!
We've gotta get out of here now and leave that book.
- What?
- Mr. Asmodeus was the one who made that -
Yeah, yeah, we know.
He's done something to Susan.
- But we're not leaving that book.
- We've got to.
He says he'll kill us if we don't.
He made the monster.
Like it or not, we have a responsibility to ourselves, if no one else.
What he did to Susan -
Well, with the book, she can be helped.
- But without it, it just -
- What did he do?
Never mind that.
Let's get the book and get out of here.
- Yes, but what if he comes back?
- Look, if Asmodeus comes back, we -
Asmodeus! I just remembered.
"Asmodeus" is another name for the devil.
- The devil?
- I believe it.
- You should have seen him in action.
- Oh, my God.
Go get the book, and let's get out of here.
Okay.
[David]
Jim, look! Over there!
Stay back here or out of the way.
- [Roars]
- [David Grunts]
Jim! Jim, use your symbol!
His back's to me.
Mr. Asmodeus?
Mr. Asmodeus, where are you?
Look, it's the book.
See? You can have it.
[Roaring]
[Growling]
He disappeared!
Oh, my God! He disappeared!
- Dave, what are we gonna -
- You two stay here.
I'm going through the barrier, see if I can helpJim. Now, give me two minutes -
- Dave!
- Jim!
Dave! Here, quick! The book!
- Grab me!
- Grab his arms.
Hurry! No! N - No!
[Vicki]
Jim! Oh, Jim!
We've got to get out of here.
Quick, take the car and get help.
- No!
- He's right, Vicki. Come on.
[Grunts]
[Wind Whistling]
Jim!
Jim!
Over here.
Here. Let me help you.
[Snapping Sound]
Okay?
Where'd the girls go?
Well, they have - I sent them back to the car to go to the police or get help.
- With the book?
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, let's stop them.
- Jim?
Hold it!
Hold up. No use running.
I forgot to give 'em the keys.
- Which one of them has the book?
- Susan, but -
- Which way is the car?
- Well, that way, but we -
- Good. We'll split up.
- No, I don't think we should.
If you find them first, yell.
Jim.
Jim?
You're notJim, are you?
What have you done toJim?
What are you?
You were all such fools.
You and your friend Watermann, who was handed the secrets of the powers of darkness... and then didn't know what to do with them.
That barrier is the result of his work.
Ha! Now do you see how helpless you are?
And now for those two girls.
[Grunts]
[Shouts]
[Vicki Gasps]
[Screaming]
[Gasps, Screaming]
David!
David. David!
David! Oh, David!
David, wake up!
David. Wake up, please.
David! David!
[Screaming]
Susan!
- Susan. The cross.
- David?
[Wings Flapping]
Susan! You okay? Come on.
David. David, those feelings!
Into the woods!
David. David, those feelings are coming back.
Hang on, Susan. We'll make it.
We'll be all right.
- I've got the cross.
- Yeah, but -
If we can just get to the highway, we'll flag a car.
Oh, David, my head.
David. Oh, David!
[Explosion]
Come on.
[Explosions]
You will not escape.
In one year and one day... you will be dead!
[Johansen]
Is that the whole story, David?
[David]
Yes, that's all of it.
I'll have to take that cross with me, David.
The crime lab wants it.
[David]
No. No! No, you can't!
- You'll get it back. Nurse. Nurse!
- No! No, you can't take my cross!
They'll kill m -
Did you hear anything usable for your newspaper story?
No, I'm afraid not.
- What about the police?
- No, I was there first.
I was in hopes something would happen, something I could get a story out of.
But this - it's a year old.
So, what did you expect to happen?
I don't know, but it's been exactly a year and a day... since that made news.
My editor wanted a follow-up.
Well, then this is it - a year and a day.
That's right, but it doesn't look like he's going to do anything.
[Grunting]
My cross!
They're gonna -
[Grunts] My cross!
Let me have it! My cross!
Let me go!
Out! Let me out!
Give me my cross!
Thanks for your time, Doctor.
My cross!
[David]
My cross!
Where is...
my cross?
My cross!
Ripped By Frederico Cabral (a.k.a. SkouD)
You wanna talk about
the vanishing wilderness?
Why are you so anxious about this?
Because they're building a dam
across the Cahulawasse River.
They're gonna flood a whole valley, Bobby.
They're drowning the river, man.
- We're talkin' to you.
- All right.
Just about the last wild, untamed,
unpolluted, unfucked-up river in the South.
- Don't you understand?
- We understand.
There ain't gonna be no more river.
Just gonna be a big, dead lake.
It's a very clean way
to make electric power.
Those lakes provide many people
with recreation.
My father-in-law has a houseboat
on Lake Bowie.
You push a little more power into Atlanta...
... a little more air conditioners
for your smug little suburb...
... and you know what's gonna happen?
They're gonna rape this whole landscape.
They're gonna rape it.
- That's an extreme point of view, Lewis.
- It is.
Extremist.
We're gonna leave Friday from Atlanta.
I'm gonna have you back
in your little suburban house...
... in time to see the football game
on Sunday afternoon.
I know you'll be back in time to see
the pompom girls at halftime.
I know that's all you care about.
Lewis, I wanna thank you.
Is there any hillbillies up here?
Yeah, there's some people up there
that ain't never seen a town before.
No bigger than Aintry, anyway.
Them, those woods, are real deep.
The river's inaccessible,
except at a couple of points.
How we gonna get there, Lewis?
I'm gonna take you there.
What the hell do you know about canoein'?
I know enough about canoein'
to handle the both of you.
I don't know what that means,
but I'll go along with you.
This is the last chance we got
to see this river.
Just wait until you feel
that white water under you.
- Ain't that right?
- I don't know if I'm ready.
If we are lost, I don't wanna hear about it.
I've never been lost in my life.
I'll have you in the water in another hour.
Christ, Drew!
Drew, look at the junk.
Look here.
I think this is where everything finishes up.
We just may be at the end of the line.
Hey, not so loud, Bobby.
Let's not upset these people.
People?
What people?
This area may be evacuated already.
That's my '51 Dodge.
No, that's my car. That's my car.
All my youth and passion...
...spent in that back seat.
It's all gone you see.
All gone. Rust and dust.
Lewis...
...we got a live one here.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
Let me ask you something.
Are you from the power company?
Power company?
What power company?
About the dam.
No, no, no.
Look, come here a minute.
See that car there?
We want somebody to drive 'em down to Aintry for us.
Hell, you're crazy.
No shit.
Fill that one up with gas, okay?
Say, mister...
I love the way you wear that hat.
You don't know nothin'.
Lewis, just ask him about his hat.
I don't think you understood me.
I wanna get some drivers...
...to drive this car...
...and that car down to Aintry.
You understand?
You might get the Griner brothers.
- Who?
- The Griner brothers.
Where do they live?
They live back over that way.
Right.
Talk about genetic deficiencies.
Isn't that pitiful?
Who's pickin' the banjo here?
Come on, I'm with you.
I'm lost.
I could play all day with that guy.
I believe you could, too.
I believe you could.
- That's good.
- That's very good, sir.
Goddamn, you play a mean banjo.
Hey, you wanna play another one?
Give him a couple of bucks.
Can that Chubby boy handle himself?
Who? Bobby?
He's rather well thought of in his field, Lewis.
Insurance?
I've never been insured in my life.
I don't believe in insurance.
There's no risk.
I have some.
Over here.
Shit!
God almighty!
Anything we can do for you?
No. It ain't as bad as I thought.
Your name Griner?
What do you wanna know for?
Can you and your brother drive two cars down to Aintry for us?
Drive 'em down there for what?
Me and my buddy, we're gonna take a canoe trip down the Cahulawasse.
We'd like to have them cars in Aintry when we get there.
Be there by Sunday noon.
Canoe trip?
That's right, a canoe trip.
What the hell you wanna go fuck around in that river for?
Because it's there.
It's there all right.
You get in there and can't get out, you gonna wish it wasn't.
Listen, Lewis, let's go back to town and...
...play golf.
I'll give you $30 to take those cars down to Aintry.
I'd take $50.
$50, my ass.
Lewis, don't play games with these people.
What'd you say?
I said, "$50, my ass."
Lewis!
I'll do it for $40.
You good for $10?
Sure.
You got it.
Brando!
- Lewis, you guys all right?
- All set.
Brando, come on out!
- We heard all this...
- I said it's all set, Drew.
This river cruise gonna happen or not?
Just get in your car, huh?
Lewis, for God's sake!
You think we should let 'em show us to the river?
If I thought that,
I would have let them go first, Ed.
We know about where it is.
Here we go.
Well, we fucked up.
You better let them show us.
You're missin' the whole point, Ed.
Where are you goin', city boy?
We'll find it.
It's only the biggest fuckin' river in the state.
We'll find it.
Lewis, you son of a bitch, why do we have to go so damn fast?
You're gonna like it.
When you see the river, you're gonna like it.
Jesus Christ!
- Lewis.
- Are you all right?
Lewis, you are gonna kill us both, you son of a bitch...
...before we ever see any water.
Slow it down, Lewis, come on.
Come on, don't fool around.
Listen, Ed.
Listen.
Hear it?
Sometimes you have to lose yourself before you can find anything.
Any snakes around here?
This is the one.
There she is.
Looks good.
A couple of more months and she'll all be gone.
Even up as far as here?
From Aintry on up.
One big, dead lake.
Over here!
Couldn't we have found a harder place to get in?
- This is steep here, now.
- All right.
- Watch yourself.
- I'm watchin'.
You're losin' glass on your bow.
It's freezin'!
Hell, it'll hold.
What the hell are we gonna do...
...if we come off this river and our cars aren't there?
They'll be there.
They're rough-lookin' boys, them hillbillies.
You judge people by the way they look.
You can trust 'em.
I'm goin' with you, Ed, and not with Mr. Lewis Medlock.
I saw how he drives these country roads...
...he don't know nothin' about.
I guess you're gonna be with me, Chubby.
Get them supplies up there.
It's cold!
Put this on.
Looks like my mama's corset or something.
Here you go.
Thank you.
- Okay, let's go.
- I'm comin'.
Can't go in the water without your paddle, boy.
I coulda went up the river without my oar.
Shit!
If we hit any strong water...
...instead of bare-assin' through it...
- I'm ready.
- Come on.
- I'm comin' on.
I got myself a plump partner here.
We can save ourselves considerable hardship...
...if we just back water, talk it out before we make our move.
You got that, boy?
All right, put on your life jacket.
Which way are we goin'?
I think downstream would be a good idea, don't you?
All right.
You and Bobby see some rocks, you yell out now, right?
Lewis, is this the way you get your rocks off?
- Let's go.
- Let's go.
- Keep your eyes open, Drew.
- I'll race you.
Keep your eyes open, Robert.
That a boy, that a boy.
Every move you make, call it out.
I'm behind you.
Right. Here we go.
See how fast we can shoot this bush.
What is this?
Is this some fast water we're comin' up to?
All right, Drew, just get in behind Lewis there.
Look at this!
- Let's pick up some speed.
- All right. Let's go.
Just a little, there you have it.
To the left.
Hey, now, that didn't hurt too bad, did it?
I'm with you, Ed.
Now you got it, boy. Very good.
Look, Ed.
Well, for the Lord's sake, will you look at that?
What do we do now?
This is gonna be fun!
Just follow us!
Hey, what happens if we flip this thing over?
Now that you brought that up, hang on to your paddle.
And if you hit any rocks, don't hit 'em with your head.
Watch Lewis.
Maybe we can learn something.
Back water now.
Oh, yeah.
Go right.
Go right, go right.
Go right, go right.
- Look up ahead where you're goin'!
- All right, I'm lookin'.
Don't quit, don't quit.
Come on, paddle, paddle.
Okay!
We did it!
Are you gonna call them out now?
- Right, go right.
- Go right.
All right, now left.
Left, to your left.
All right.
- Keep it straight.
- Watch that tree.
- Left.
- Watch your head.
We ain't gonna make it!
Turn it!
Hey, this doesn't seem right.
Just a little unorthodox.
Go left, Chubby. Come on.
Straighten it out.
All right, I got it straight.
Oh, my God!
- Yes, thank you, Lord.
- Turn it around.
Hold it up there. Slow it down.
All right, go.
Go!
Good, push straight ahead.
Hell, here's a big one!
We're gonna make it. Keep it straight.
I'm with you, Ed!
All right. You're doin' all right, now.
Keep her headed right.
Go, go, go...
There's a rock!
On the right, watch it now.
- Okay, now.
- I got it.
All right now, Chubby, don't fall apart.
What the hell I tell you?
He's something else, ain't he?
- Hold on.
- I'll tell you, Lewis...
...that's the best, the second best sensation I ever felt.
You did good, Chubby, you did good.
Damn, I thought we'd bought the farm there for a while.
You know that one place there...
You know what I was just thinking?
The first explorers saw this country...
...saw it just like us.
In a canoe.
I can imagine how they felt.
Yeah, we beat it, didn't we?
Didn't we beat that?
You don't beat it.
You don't beat this river.
Machines are gonna fail.
And the system's gonna fail.
Then...
And then what?
Then survival.
Who has the ability to survive.
That's the game: Survive.
And you can't wait for it to happen, can you?
You can't wait for it.
Well, the system's done all right by me.
Oh, yeah.
You got a nice job.
Got a nice house...
...nice wife...
...nice kid.
You make that sound...
...rather shitty, Lewis.
Why do you go on these trips with me, Ed?
I like my life, Lewis.
Yeah, but why do you go on these trips with me?
You know, sometimes I wonder about that.
Here's to you, Lewis.
Hot damn, he got one!
Terrific, Lewis.
I hate him.
I'm glad we came here.
Lewis?
Lewis does not drink.
It's true, Lewis, what you said.
There's somethin' in the woods and the water that we have lost in the city.
We didn't lose it, just sold it.
Well, I'll say one thing for the system.
System did produce the air mattress.
Or, as it's better known among we camping types, the instant broad.
And if you fellas will excuse me,
I'm gonna go be mean to my air mattress.
I do baptize thee now, in the name of modern technology.
How sweet, yeah.
Lewis?
Does he think he is Tarzan, or what?
He knows the woods, though.
He really does.
Not really.
He learned 'em, he doesn't feel 'em.
That's his problem.
He wants to be one with nature and he can't hack it.
This is a hell of a time to be tellin' us that.
Jesus!
Lewis, you scared the shit out of me!
Oh, who was it, Lewis?
I don't know. I thought I heard something.
Something or someone?
I don't know.
Good night, Lewis.
Good night, Drew.
I'm goin' to sleep.
Night has fallen.
And there's nothin' we can do about it.
I had my first wet dream in a sleepin' bag.
How was it?
Great.
There's no repeatin' it.
Never mind.
No matter what disaster may occur in other parts of the world...
...or what petty little problems...
...arise in Atlanta...
...no one can find us up here.
Good night, Lewis.
Goddamn it!
Hey, Bobby, look what came out of the forest.
Get a shot, Ed?
Hell, sometimes a man can...
...hunt for three years...
...never get a shot. Isn't that right, Lewis?
- Right.
I don't understand how anyone could shoot an animal.
Some people never can, Drew.
I've known tournament archers, damn good shots.
Never out of the five ring.
Draw down on a live animal and they get buck fever.
What the hell's that?
Loss of control, psychological.
Who gives a shit?
You take that Chubby boy with you today, okay?
Hope we can get off this river today.
Don't get too far ahead, now.
No, we'll be takin' it slow.
Easy, easy, my man.
I got eaten alive last night.
My bites have got bites.
I'm a salesman, Ed.
Good morning.
I'm not mad at you, Ed.
Just do me a favor, don't holler at me.
I'm not used to bein' hollered at.
Damn friend of yours screamed at me all day long yesterday.
Paddle, you son of a bitch.
Look!
What in the hell are Lewis and Drew doin' up there anyway?
Probably they're doin' the same thing we are.
Bobby?
How goes it?
What the hell you think you're doing?
Headin' downriver.
Little canoe trip. Headin' for Aintry.
Aintry?
Sure, this river only runs one way, Captain.
Haven't you heard?
You ain't never gonna get down to Aintry.
Why not?
'Cause.
This river don't go to Aintry.
You done taken the wrong turn.
See, this here river don't go nowhere near Aintry.
Where does it go then?
Boy, you are lost.
Well, hell, I guess this river comes out somewhere, don't it?
That's where we're going, somewhere.
Look, we don't want any trouble here.
If you gentlemen have a still near here, that's fine with us.
Why sure. We'd never tell anybody where it is.
You know something?
You're right, we're lost.
- We don't know where in the hell we are.
- A still?
Right, yeah, you're makin' whiskey up here.
We'll buy some. We could use it.
Do you know what you're talkin' about?
We don't know what you're talking about.
You said something about makin' whiskey.
Ain't that what you said?
We don't know what you're doing, and we don't care.
That's none of our business.
That's right, none of your goddamn business.
We've got quite a long journey ahead of us, gentlemen...
Hold it.
You ain't going no damn where!
This is ridiculous. Excuse me.
Hold it, or I'll blow your guts out all over these woods.
Wait, we can talk this thing over.
What is it you require of us?
Well, we require that you get your goddamn ass up in them woods.
- All right, now, look.
- Right now! You get up there now.
Okay, all right.
- Get up there.
- All right.
Faster, boy.
- Move your ass.
- Easy with the weapon!
You shut up.
- Come on.
- Okay.
- Back here.
- What's the trouble?
- You're in trouble.
- Just don't argue with 'em, Ed.
- See that saplin' over yonder?
- You heard him.
Back up against this.
Is this a matter of money?
If we want money, we'll take it.
- Back up against the tree.
- I'm pretty far back against it now.
Now, stay just there. Now, be real still.
If he tries that again, shoot that one there.
I'll blow his damned balls off.
You ain't a big boy.
Be still now.
Now let's you just drop them pants.
Drop?
Just take 'em right off!
I mean, what's this all about?
Don't say anything, just do it.
Just drop 'em, boy!
You ever had your balls cut off, you fuckin' ape?
Lord.
Look there, that's sharp.
I bet it'd shave a hair.
Why don't you try it and see?
Lord. Deliver us from all...
Pull off that little bitty shirt there, too.
Is he bleeding?
He bled.
Them panties, take 'em off.
Get up, boy!
Come on, get on up there.
No, no, no.
Oh, no. Don't.
- Don't.
- Hey, boy.
- You look just like a hog.
- No, don't.
Just like a hog.
Come here, piggy, piggy, piggy.
Come on, piggy. Come on, piggy.
Come on, piggy, give me a ride.
- Get up and give me a ride.
- All right.
- Get up and give me a ride.
- All right.
- Get up! Get up there!
- All right.
Oh, no, no.
Looks like we got us a sow here instead of a boar.
Don't!
Don't!
What's the matter, boy?
I bet you squeal.
I bet you can squeal like a pig.
Let's squeal. Squeal now.
Squeal.
Squeal.
Squeal louder. Louder.
Louder.
Louder.
Louder!
Louder! Get down now, boy!
There, get them britches down.
That's that.
You can do better than that, boy.
Come on, squeal. Squeal!
What's you wanna do with him?
He got a real pretty mouth, ain't he?
That's the truth.
You're gonna do some prayin' for me, boy.
And you better pray good.
Here, hold that on him.
You better run, you son of a bitch!
Can't we do anything for him?
No.
It's a center shot.
I thought they'd surely kill us.
They would have.
They would have for sure.
What we gonna do with him?
There's not but one thing to do:
Take the body down to Aintry.
Turn it over to the highway patrol.
Tell 'em what happened.
Tell 'em what, exactly?
Just what happened.
This is justifiable homicide if anything is.
They were sexually assaulting two members of our party at gunpoint.
Like you said, there was nothin' else we could do.
Is he alive?
Not now.
Well, let's get our heads together.
Come on, let's not do anything foolish.
Anybody know anything about the law?
I was on jury duty once.
It wasn't a murder trial.
Murder trial?
I don't know the technical word for it,
Drew, but I know this:
You take this man and turn him over to the sheriff, there'll be a trial all right.
Trial by jury.
So what?
We killed a man, Drew.
Shot him in the back.
A mountain man.
Cracker.
Gives us somethin' to consider.
All right, consider it. We're listening.
Shit, all these people are related.
I'll be damned if I'll come back and stand trial...
...with this man's aunt and uncle...
...maybe his mama and his daddy sittin' in the jury box.
What do you think, Bobby?
How about you, Ed?
I don't know. I really don't know.
Now you listen, Lewis.
I don't know what you got in mind...
...but if you conceal this body, you'll be charged with murder.
That much law I do know.
This ain't one of your fuckin' games!
You killed somebody!
There he is!
I see him, Drew.
That's right, I killed somebody.
But you're wrong if you don't see this as a game.
Now you listen, Ed!
Damn it, we can get out of this thing!
Without any questions asked!
We get connected up with that body and the law...
...this thing's gonna be hangin' over us the rest of our lives.
We gotta get rid of that guy.
Just how are you gonna do that, Lewis?
Where?
Anywhere.
Everywhere.
Nowhere.
How do you know that other guy hasn't already gone for the police?
What in the hell is he gonna tell 'em, Drew?
What he did to Bobby?
Why couldn't he go get some other mountain men?
Now why isn't he gonna do that?
You look around you, Lewis!
He could be out there anywhere, watchin' us right now.
We ain't gonna be so goddamned hard to follow, draggin' a corpse.
You let me worry about that, Drew.
You let me take care of that.
You know what's gonna be here?
Right here. A lake.
As far as you can see.
Hundreds of feet deep.
Hundreds of feet deep.
Did you ever look over a lake...
...and think about somethin' buried underneath it?
Buried underneath it!
Man, that's about as buried as you can get!
Well, I am telling you, Lewis,
I don't want any part of it.
Well, you are part of it!
It is a matter of the law!
The law?
The law?
What law?
Where's the law, Drew?
You believe in democracy, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Well, then, we'll take a vote.
I'll stand by it.
So will you.
What do you say, Bobby?
Let's bury him.
I don't want this gettin' around.
Okay?
Okay?
It's up to you, Ed.
It's all up to you, Ed.
Now just think what you're doin', Ed.
For God's sake.
You got a wife.
You got a child.
You're not involved in this.
Think about your family, Ed.
This may be the most important decision of your whole life, Ed.
Yes!
There's no way we can change this.
There's no way we can change what happened to Bobby.
We gotta do the right thing.
We must live with it for the rest of our lives.
Right!
I'm with Lewis.
All right, let's get on with it, then.
Lewis. Let's go.
What's the plan, Lewis?
Plan?
We just paddle on down to Aintry, get the cars and go home.
Put your jacket on, Drew.
Drew!
Put your life jacket on!
Drew, paddle! Drew!
Drew?
Drew, what's the matter?
Lewis, somethin's wrong. To the side.
Something's wrong!
No! Go on!
What is it?
Don't stop, Ed!
- I'm gonna pull in.
- Go! Go!
What happened?
Look out!
Where's Drew?
My leg's broke.
Where's Drew?
I'm takin' roll call!
Drew was shot!
Somethin' happened to him.
What?
Drew was shot.
Shot?
Here, here.
Hold him here.
- I got him.
- Hold on!
Drew was shot!
Bobby, Drew was shot!
He was shot, Bobby!
Drew was shot!
Here's his jacket!
He wasn't wearin' it!
Maybe Lewis is right!
Of course, he's right. Of course!
You mean that other guy shot him?
Did he?
Did you see him?
Drew was shot.
Lewis says that other guy...
...that toothless bastard, shot him!
He's right up there!
He's gonna try and kill us, too!
If he killed Drew...
...he's gonna have to kill us!
Lewis, I'll tell you what.
We'll wait until dark, and we'll put you in the bottom of the canoe...
...and we'll sneak out of here.
- Okay, Ed?
- Bobby, look at those rapids down there!
- Look at those rapids!
- Christ!
We can't move out of here in the dark.
We're not gonna move you, Lewis.
Lewis, we're trapped in this gorge.
What're we gonna do, Lewis?
You're the guy with the answers.
What the hell do we do now?
Now you get to play the game.
You're ruined! Lewis, you're ruined!
Listen.
He's hurt bad, isn't he?
What're we gonna do?
The guy must know exactly where we are.
Well, if he knows where we are...
...then we sure as hell know where he's gonna be.
Right up there.
Christ!
What a view!
Goddamn it!
You'll never get out of this gorge alive!
Goddamn it!
Pull yourself together.
Release.
I don't believe it!
You did it, Ed.
You killed him!
Good.
Lewis had a bad night.
More than once I thought he'd die.
You did it, Ed. Good.
You sure it's him?
That's the guy with the gun, huh?
I think so.
He wasn't just some guy...
...up there huntin' or something?
- You tell me!
Was he shot?
What about here? What about right there?
Could have been a rock.
What are you gonna do with Drew?
If a bullet made this, there are people who can tell.
Oh, God!
There's no end to it.
I didn't really know him.
Drew was...
...a good husband...
...to his wife Linda.
You're a wonderful father to your boys, Drew...
...Jimmy and Billy Ray.
And if...
...we come through this, I promise...
...to do all I can for 'em.
He was the best of us.
Amen.
Christ! Look at that! God help us.
We made it. We made it, Ed.
We made it.
- We're back, Ed!
- Yeah.
- We gotta get Lewis to a doctor.
- Right, Ed.
Gotta get Lewis to a doctor.
We're back! We made it!
Everything happened...
Listen, everything happened right here.
Everything happened right here.
Lewis broke his leg in those rapids there.
- And Drew drowned here. In this place.
- No, no, Ed.
- No, nothin' happened here.
- Bobby, listen to me!
We got to stop them from lookin' upriver.
It's important that we get together on this thing.
You understand?
I understand, Eddie, I understand.
That's right, Lewis. That's our story.
Lewis, we're back.
- It's all right.
- Get Lewis to a doctor.
All right, Ed.
All right.
We'll find a place to put it.
We're not out of this yet!
They brought the cars.
You come for the cars, sir?
Yes.
Do you have a phone?
Phone?
Telephone?
Yes, sir.
You're gonna be all right.
What in the world happened to you guys?
Drew Ballinger.
Did you look for him?
A long time.
Could you show us where it happened?
How'd you manage to shoot yourself with your own arrow?
Didn't think it could be done.
This is nice.
What's that?
Chromium, paper tissues...
...hot water... That's nice.
You fallin' asleep?
Don't forget to phone your wife.
Let her know how you are.
Yes, I will, thank you.
Hello. Come on in.
We saved you a seat.
Do you feel like eating something?
Please.
Some corn?
Would you like some peas?
This corn is special, isn't it?
I love good corn.
We need that cucumber
I got out of the garden last night.
You know how long it was?
- Tell me.
- Twelve-and-a-half inches long.
Then I measured it around, and it's ten-and-a-half around.
That's the darndest lookin' cucumber you'll ever see.
I tell you, I'll send it over and let you see it, if you doubt it.
I think you're crazy sometimes.
We can show you the place.
Now I know where you told me it was.
We just wanna cooperate.
You recognize that piece of canoe?
Now, we lost one. That could be it.
But you ain't sure?
Yeah, I think so, but it's kind of confusing.
I'd think you'd recognize your own canoe.
I'd appreciate it if you'd show me that spot.
Ed, we're in trouble. They don't believe us!
What did you tell him, Bobby?
What we agreed on.
I heard you. I was in that room, Bobby.
What did you tell him?
They found part of the green canoe, right?
Upstream, and you got scared.
Didn't you, Bobby? I know you.
You told him the truth, didn't you, Bobby?
- You told him the truth!
- I didn't do that!
I told 'em...
...like we said.
But I don't think they believed me.
Ed, I think they found that other canoe...
...upstream, above where we told him.
I never said that.
Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.
- I know damn well you did.
I know what I said.
Yeah, well, that's a goddamn lie.
Sheriff, that ain't what he said this morning.
You tell me how a canoe can drift upriver.
Now what about this?
Look, Sheriff...
...we been through quite a lot.
I don't know what's wrong with your man there.
Mr. Queen's got a brother-in-law...
...back up in there somewhere.
He took off huntin' three days ago and...
...nobody's heard from him since.
Mr. Queen thought maybe you all...
...might've happened up on him somewhere.
Well, we didn't.
Don't let 'em go. These boys is lying.
We got nothin' to hold 'em for.
We don't have a thing.
Let's just wait and see what comes out of the river.
That there's the town hall.
Right over there's the old fire station.
Played a lot of checkers over there.
All this land's gonna be covered with water.
Best thing that ever happened to this town.
We may have to stop just a minute for the church to get out of the way.
Christ.
Doctor, how's our boy?
We're doin' everything we can for him.
But there's a chance he might lose the leg, so take it easy on him, okay?
I'll talk with you later.
Officer?
Has he been awake yet?
No, we're still waitin' for him to come around.
Lewis, listen, we had to change our story.
How you feeling?
Never better.
Did you hear me?
What happened on that last set of rapids?
I don't remember nothing.
Nothing.
- Want me to drive Drew's car back?
- No.
Talk to his wife?
I'll do it, Bobby, thank you.
You all about ready to leave?
Yeah.
The Griner boys brought these cars down to you from Orie, is that right?
Right.
You happen to see another man with 'em up there?
There was someone, wasn't there?
I think so, yes.
Before you go, buddy, let me ask you something.
How come you all ended up with four life jackets?
Didn't we have an extra one?
No.
Drew wasn't wearin' his.
Well, how come he wasn't wearin' it?
I don't know.
Don't ever do nothin' like this again.
Don't come back up here.
You don't have to worry about that, Sheriff.
I'd kinda like to see this town die peaceful.
I hope Deputy Queen finds his brother-in-law.
He'll come in drunk probably.
Good-bye, Ed.
'Bye, Bobby.
I don't think I'll see you for a while.
Hey, Charlie.
What you got there, guy?
What's the matter?
It's all right.
It's all right.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.

Easy.
Easy, girl.
Easy, girl.
Easy.
Hold it, girl.
Hold it.
Well, I want each of you fellas...
...to buy yourself a $1 Ingersoll watch.
You can't break 'em with a hammer and...
...won't lose more than a minute a month.
- I know we're late, Mr. Andersen.
- You're two hours late!
Work starts around here at 6:00 a.m.
- Goes for everybody.
- Yes, sir.
We spent the night in Bozeman.
Town's empty as a bone orchard.
Everybody's lit out for the Ruby River.
- What for?
- Gold.
At the Ruby?
Played out years ago.
No. This is a new strike.
About 20 miles above there.
Almost to the Beaverhead.
Tell him, Smiley.
Well, the fact is, me and the boys thought...
...we'd like to take a ride up and have ourselves a little look-see.
Got 1,500 head o' steer to get to Belle Fourche before it snows on me.
You're hired on to move 'em.
- We'd like to help you out...
- LLike to help me out?
The others done pulled out.
There's only five of us left.
That busts it.
You work us night and day, and Christmas, too!
- Pay ya every Saturday!
- There's easier money around.
We'll do it this way.
We'll take a ride up there and look around, two or three weeks.
If it don't work, we'll get the others and come right back.
You have my word on that.
Don't he, boys?
That's right.
- Your word?
- Yes, sir.
Well, here's my word.
Get the hell off my spread!
Now!
Miserable.
Well, they run...
...clean out from under me.
Whole damn bunch of 'em.
I heard most of it. LLet me see that.
A fool comes to town with a fistful of gold dust and...
...every jackass in 50 miles around lights out after him.
My day a man'd stay with you on a handshake.
It's a different day, Wil.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I'll go over to the Bigelow place, see what I can turn up.
Maybe Henry...
Henry Bigelow's 60 years old, Wil.
So am I.
Kinda noisy around here.
It's been like this all week.
Any luck?
No.
I traveled 30 miles today...
...didn't find a single hand that could...
...throw in with me.
- Did you talk to Parker?
- Yeah.
His wife's gonna have a baby.
How about Miller?
His wife wants to have a baby.
Sucker's only been married three weeks.
Well, if you can't get your cattle to market this year, put it off till next.
What'll I do with this year's bills?
Pay 'em next year.
Hell, a lot of folks around here do.
No, I won't go on tick.
If your neck was any stiffer...
...you couldn't even bend over to pull your boots on!
Shut up and pour!
Did ya ever think of hirin' boys?
What boys?
The schoolboys.
Oh, sure, and women.
How about my momma in Cedar City?
She's only 92.
You ain't got a lot of choices.
There ain't a kid in that school over 15.
They're between hay and grass.
I need men.
How old was you when you went on your first cattle drive?
- What difference does that make?
- How old was you, Wil?
- Well, in my day...
- How old?
Thirteen.
And my old man's pants fit me.
"This convenient arrangement is designed...
"...to adjust ladies' long dresses to a walking length.
"It is worn around the waist, has two ends..."
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
'Afternoon, Miss Ellen.
Have you gentlemen decided you need some additional schooling?
Well, I guess we could probably use some, but we just come visitin'.
Well, come in.
Please, sit down.
It isn't often we get visitors.
We were reading from the Montgomery Ward Catalogue.
The grammar's quite correct and it's always most interesting.
Elizabeth, would you continue, please?
"...the longer of which has a nickel clasp...
"...which holds the bottom of the skirt to any desirable height...
"...the shorter one, a hook for holding a fan.
"This elevator has been worn in Chicago during the past season a great deal...
"...and ladies consider it almost indispensable."
Thank you, Elizabeth.
Now, let us hear how well the boys do.
Put away your catalogues and take out your readers.
Charles Hunnicutt.
Would you read today's assignment for us?
"Hail to thee, blith..."
Blith?
Blithe.
"...blithe spirit, bird thou never wert."
Weren't?
"Bird thou never wert."
"That from heaven or near it
Pourest thy..."
Get away!
- What have you got?
- Nothing.
Homer, take your hand from behind your back!
And open it!
Stop it! Now stop it!
Sit down!
Give it up, Wil.
Can't move heaven and earth.
Well...
Whatcha thinkin' about?
You.
Stringy women like you live a long time.
Sisters have seen all their husbands put under.
More than likely you will, too.
And I don't wanna...
...see you end up somebody's fry cook.
I've been your fry cook for 40 years.
A pretty good one, too.
It's gettin' chilly.
Come on in, have a cup o' coffee.
I'll be in.
Damn Anse!
He put 'em up to this.
I'd better jump straight down their throat and get it over with.
Don't be hard on 'em.
They must've traveled half the night to get here this early.
Good morning, boys.
Good morning, Mr. Andersen.
LLooks like it's gonna be another fine day.
What can I do for ya?
Anse Petersen says you're lookin' for hands for your drive.
We come to put in for the job.
Well, any of ya ever been on a cattle drive?
Any of ya ever herded cattle?
Well, what can you do?
We can all ride.
Most of us can rope.
Couple of us are pretty good shots.
Well, that's somethin'.
You know, trail drivin' is no Sunday school picnic.
You gotta figure you're dealin' with the dumbest...
...orneriest critter on God's green earth.
A cow's nothin' but a lot of trouble tied up in a leather bag.
A horse ain't much better.
Speakin' of a horse...
Got me a little green broke filly over there.
Name's Crazy Alice.
Now if one of you was to stay aboard her, for, say, a count of 10...
...I might just keep that in mind come hirin' time.
Thank you.
Steady, girl, steady.
Easy.
Easy. Here we are.
Who's first?
Well, I'll try and saddle her while you're makin' up your mind.
Made up your mind?
I'll go first.
I'll start countin' when you hit the saddle.
Five. Six.
Seven. Eight.
Time!
Get off of her!
My name's Hunnicutt.
I'm 15.
And everybody calls me Slim.
Easy, girl.
I'm next.
Easy, girl. Easy.
She's rank. Keep your mind in the middle.
Bail off, youngster! Bail off!
My name's Homer Weems, Mr. Andersen.
And I hope I ain't rode all the rough off of her.
- You all right, boy?
- Yes, sir.
My name's Clyde Potter.
They call me Fats.
Tendin' toward the gut myself.
My name's...
His name's Bob Wilson. He gets excited.
I'm Charlie Schwartz. I'm Jewish.
I've settled it every place in town but here.
Must keep ya pretty busy.
All right, who's next?
I am.
Good mornin'.
Close the gate.
Did ya see that?
Here, boy. I think you can handle her now.
Keep it.
All right, break it up.
Break it up!
Come on, Slim, get back on the fence.
Hurry it up.
Settle down!
You all right?
Yes, sir.
I didn't see you at the school.
I don't go to school.
Got a name?
Cimarron.
That's half a name. What's the rest of it?
There's no more name.
I'm a mistake of nature.
That was a pretty good ride you made.
But I'll have to think you over.
You having difficulty seeing the board?
Homer, Bob, why don't you take these slates and pads...
...put them underneath the board and raise it up...
...so that everyone can see the lower lines.
There, that's much better.
Thank you, boys.
When you've copied your assignments for the week you may all go home.
I'd like to talk to these boys before class breaks up, if you don't mind.
Do you wish to address the young ladies, as well?
No, I don't think so.
I've nothing to say to young ladies.
Then we bow to the fact that it's a man's world and leave you to it.
Girls...
I don't expect to get to...
...Belle Fourche with one single head of beef...
...but I'm cornered...
...so I'm takin' you on.
Now this is the way it's gonna be.
I'm a man and you're boys.
Not cowmen, not by a damned sight.
Nothin' but cowboys, just like the word says.
And I'm gonna remind ya of it every single minute of every day and night.
This is the Double-O.
This is Belle Fourche.
In between is 400 miles of the meanest country in the West.
And the only way we're gonna get through is if...
...you take orders.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Bring a bedroll...
...a couple of good ropes...
...horse, if you've got one.
You'll get the best food in the territory...
...no rest, and damn little sleep.
And 50 big silver dollars...
...if we make it to Belle Fourche.
Now you'll show up at my place...
...first Monday after school's out, at 5:00 a.m.
And come with grit teeth.
'Cause, gentlemen, that's when school really begins.
Mr. Andersen?
Yeah?
All of us?
Come here.
Anybody, that tall.
They must've rode all over the territory to get that many brand-new hats.
You know...
...you're gonna have to feed these kids till my cook comes.
I don't mind.
I like the sound of boys.
Next one of you pulls a knife in this outfit...
...you're gonna learn better at the buckle end of my belt.
Now, what happened?
You.
What went on here?
He said somethin' about his mother.
What'd he say?
Your mother is a whore.
- You understand Spanish, Mr. Andersen?
- I understand.
So does Slim.
Clear out.
Get on your horse and clear out.
All right. There's plenty of road.
Give me back my gun.
I'm not in the habit of throwin' kerosene on a fire.
It cost me $30.
Send me a bill.
You're gonna get it, mister.
All right, everybody packin' iron unload it.
Throw it over here in this buggy.
And I mean anything that shoots.
Anybody holds out so much as a pea-shooter...
...may find himself hangin' by a tie-rope 70 foot up in a tree.
You ever fire that thing?
No, sir.
This hardware'll be locked up in the chuck wagon.
You got anything to settle between you, butt heads.
Now get rid of those bedrolls and...
...get mounted and we'll see how much you don't know.
All right, turn him loose.
Bring in the iron, Charlie.
Been smellin' that for 40 years.
Never could get used to it.
- You.
- Yes, sir.
- What's your name?
- Hardy Fimps.
Go rope one.
You'll do.
I've seen 'em fight all day, from dawn to dark.
Sometimes the young one wins, sometimes the old.
Young one's got more muscle.
Old one's got more experience.
That's the old one still standin' there.
- Keep his nose out of the water.
- Watch out!
Hang on to that line!
Steady, steady. Pull!
Slow, Weedy!
Watch out for those horns.
You got him.
Now hold him right there.
Pull his nose back now.
Keep his head back.
All right, take him out!
Pull!
Get him outta there!
You need some help?
Nah, they're doin' all right.
Mr. Wil Andersen?
What can I do for you?
Well, I think there's somethin' that we can do for each other.
My name's Asa Watts. How are ya?
This here's Henry Williams and Red Tucker.
They both ride with me.
We heard that you was goin' on a drive, needin' some hands.
You sure heard right.
Well, sir, we're the very best.
You fellas aren't from around here.
No, sir, we're not.
We're from Denton County.
We've been up on the Ruby River pannin' for gold...
...like every other damn fool.
These last 22 days, you know, all we got was $2 worth of dust and nothin' more.
Ain't that pitiful?
Now we're ready to get back to what we know, and that's cows.
What outfits have you worked with?
Well, sir, we've worked for every big outfit in North Montana. You name 'em.
No. You name 'em.
All righty.
There's Oscar West at the Triple-D...
...and George C. Thompson over there at McNeil...
...Dillard Fant at the Santa Rosa.
How long were you with Fant?
Well, sir, the last eight years.
What a lovely old gentleman he is.
If we weren't three of the damnedest fools you ever saw we'd be there with him now.
And if you were, you'd be in a pine box.
Sir?
I was pallbearer at his funeral five years ago.
Well, I've been caught at it, haven't I?
Mr. Andersen, I'm sorry. I lied to you.
I got all 'em names right out of the Stockman's Association Brand Book.
We're fresh out of jail, the three of us, and...
...I don't know, you tell that to people and they just turn a deaf ear on ya.
Well, I'm afraid I can't use you.
How do you mean you can't use us?
I won't use you.
Will you be like everybody else and not give us a chance to redeem ourselves?
I don't hold jail against you, but I hate a liar.
You're a hard man, Mr. Andersen.
It's a hard life. I got work to do.
Sir, before you get back to your work,
I'd like to ask you one more little question.
What are you gonna use for hands on this drive of yours, huh?
Them little-bitty boys down there?
Come on, you know better than that.
You know what you'll need to trundle 'em boys across the prairie?
A baby carriage.
Well, whatever I need I'll get.
I bet you will.
Good luck to you, Mr. Andersen.
Get mounted!
There's your saddle band.
They've been livin' wild all winter.
We'll finish breaking 'em on the drive.
We'll pick our strings by age.
Who's the oldest?
I am.
Get yourself a rope.
All right.
And here.
May I have some more, please?
Sure.
You eat that much at home?
We've been branding cattle all day.
Can't be that hungry. They're showin' off.
Good afternoon, mister.
Were you lookin' for me?
Who are you?
Name's Nightlinger. Jebediah Nightlinger.
I was expecting a white man.
Jim Wheeler. What happened to him?
Well, he got drunk on Sunday and married on Monday.
I came in his stead.
I told him the fix I was in.
He promised he wouldn't let me down.
He doesn't even wash his hands before he puts 'em in the pot.
I do.
Can you cook?
Apple pie.
Green apples sliced thin.
LLard, flour, salt, water to bind.
Sugar, cinnamon, a dab of butter.
Three slashes on the crust, one for steam...
...and two because your momma did it that way.
Good afternoon to you, lady. Am I correct?
Why, yes, indeed.
Mrs. Andersen.
Ma'am.
You ever been on a trail drive?
The Oregon, Chisholm...
...Santa Fe, some without names.
I don't know.
I like to travel with a man I'm used to.
You'll get used to me.
What do you want for wages?
All I can get.
This job pays $100.
A hundred?
That's the money.
Well, if you should get flooded out, stampeded out, frozen out...
...or scalped by wild red Indians...
...there'll always be substantial food on the plate and coffee on the boil. But...
...that'll cost you $125.
You're a pretty independent character, aren't ya?
It's been said of me.
Put your wagon in the barn.
Are all these small boys...?
No! They're my trail hands, God help us.
Well, doesn't anything larger wanna work for you?
We had a case o' gold fever around here.
They're all that's left.
I'll fix up some sugar tits to take along.
Hey, Dan. What's sugar tits?
This one suits me.
Smells of boy in here.
You're staring at me, children!
I feel your eyes on my back.
Now why is that?
Well, sir...
...you're the first nigger we ever saw.
Then it must be a treat for you.
Something different for a change.
Are you black all over?
Except for the white o' my eyes.
Is your, you know, your...
It is. Black, too.
See? He's the same as us, except for that color.
The same as you?
The same as you!
Oh, children.
My father was a brawny Moor.
Six feet six inches tall.
He bound his head in a red velvet cloth.
He wore a curved sword...
...forged from the finest Toledo steel.
He captured a lady...
...bright and dark.
He took her in his arms...
...and wrapped her in a warm quilt...
...and carried her off.
They came to a castle...
...and he battered down the doors with the trunk of an oak tree...
...and killed everybody in it!
Just so they could rest the night.
LLater...
...while she slept...
...he walked the parapets...
...and became a king.
Is that true?
If it isn't, it ought to be.
Blow out those lamps!
You, that lamp!
Do your work.
Don't be profane and don't listen to profanity.
Wash your feet daily.
Say your prayers nightly.
Yes, sir.
You have to go out in the world and prove yourself.
I guess that's right.
God bless you, son.
- Don't be fresh.
- I won't.
And don't come to any harm.
Don't worry, I won't.
So long, Gramps.
Sixty days oughta see me back.
I want two things.
What?
You home again and a string of blue glass beads.
You don't ask for much, Ann.
I don't need much.
Well, if ya run into any trouble, call Anse.
I'll think about ya before I go to bed at night.
You do and you won't sleep.
- Are you ready, Mr. Nightlinger?
- LLong ready, Mr. Andersen.
LLet's go to Belle Fourche.
Move 'em out!
Yes, sir! Move 'em out, Weedy!
Start 'em, Charlie!
Move 'em out, Bob!
Move 'em, Jim!
All right, don't move 'em over here.
Keep 'em over this way!
That's good, Slim.
Right pace, Homer.
Any faster you'd be runnin' tallow off of 'em.
That's money out of my pocket.
We'll try and make Still Meadows tonight.
Still Meadows.
All right, take 'em through.
Take 'em through. Come on!
Get with it! Head 'em down there!
Head 'em downhill!
Get up there, kid. Get up where you were!
Get down, Hardy!
Hey, there's a stray.
You want me to get him?
Easy, easy! Don't stop, go with 'em!
Go with 'em!
Go on with the wagon!
Easy, easy. Don't stop 'em.
Go with 'em! Go with 'em!
You were sleepin'.
I'm sorry, Mr. Andersen.
I pay a full day's wages, and expect a full day's work.
Drove you hard today, didn't he, children?
- You think it's gonna be like this everyday?
- Yep.
Sundays, too?
There ain't no Sundays west of Omaha.
Slim, give that to Hardy.
Watch it, it's hot.
I never noticed before...
...but most of the people I know are quiet compared to Mr. Andersen.
He's quiet, it just comes out loud.
That youngster's been following all day.
I know it.
Who is he?
A burr under my hide.
You just gonna leave him out there?
Mr. Nightlinger, you take care of the kitchen, I'll take care of the drive.
You know, in the late war between the states...
...I served under an officer...
...just like you.
Is that right?
As a matter of fact, I shot that military gentleman in the buttocks...
...just outside of Vicksburg.
I'd have hung ya.
They gave me a medal.
In my regiment, Mr. Nightlinger...
...I was known as Old Iron Pants.
You might keep that in mind.
Rise and shine! Rise and shine!
Hey, Hardy, you wake up!
Homer! Get up and go wake up good Slim over there!
Up, up, up!
Out of these sacks, into your britches!
Come on, Jim, get up! Get up!
My God, get up!
Don't let the sun catch ya sleepin'.
Mr. Nightlinger, what's for breakfast?
Stewed apples, bacon and biscuits.
Well, forget the apples.
Slap some bacon on a biscuit and let's go!
We're burnin' daylight!
Burnin' daylight?
All I see are stars.
You'll see a lot more of 'em if you don't move it.
Bring 'em on!
Bring 'em on, Mr. Nightlinger!
Go on. Stay with 'em. Keep 'em upriver.
Stay upriver, Mr. Nightlinger, there's some soft sand down there.
Keep 'em upriver, and let 'em go higher up their heads.
Well, come on.
Keep 'em upstream so they won't have to swim.
Push 'em upstream, that's it.
Good work.
Head 'em upstream more.
Hold 'em up in the canyon till they all get across.
Help! Help!
Come on.
Here's one of your strays.
You all right?
Better sit on his back and pump him out.
Get his feet up.
Move your gear into camp.
I won't charge you for the days
I've been following you.
You're hired on, just like the rest.
You work out, you stay.
If you don't, it's a long walk back.
You!
You almost got him killed, you know that?
- But I tried to tell you.
- The hell you did!
I tried hard.
If you'd have been out in that water we'd have heard you.
I couldn't get the words out.
You could've if you'd wanted to.
You just didn't want to bad enough.
Before God, I tried.
Tryin' don't get it done!
The fact is, you almost let your friend choke to death out in that river.
- I'd rather die than done that.
- Then you're a liar!
It ain't my fault I stutter.
LListen to me, you whinin' little whelp...
...you'll stop stutterin' or get the hell out of here.
You're gonna stop it or go home, do you hear me?
You son of a bitch.
What did you say?
- You goddamn son of a bitch!
- Say that again.
- You goddamn, mean son of a bitch!
- Say it faster!
You goddamn, mean, dirty son of a bitch!
I wouldn't make it a habit callin' me that, son.
I did it.
Did ya hear me?
I did it.
I did it.
Hey, Cimarron.
I ain't had a chance to thank you for haulin' me out.
I sure am obliged.
- Well, I figure I owe you for it.
- Yeah?
How much in dollars?
Well, I can't pay you in dollars.
I ain't got any dollars.
Well, money's what cuts it with me.
Hey, wait a minute.
I picked this up on the trail.
I know it ain't gold, it's just fool's gold, but it's kinda pretty.
You callin' me a fool?
No, no, I didn't mean it like that.
I got no use for it.
You write that yourself?
No, no. It's printed on paper.
I've been tryin' to learn it.
Well, there's nothin' to it.
It's just like arithmetic.
All you gotta do is just...
...count lines and spaces.
That tells you where the notes go.
It ain't hard.
LLooks like fly specks to me.
Some guy named Vivaldi wrote it.
It's kinda pretty.
If that's that ol' Tennessee sour mash, put a little in there.
Good for my rheumatism.
That comes with old age.
Yeah, miserable old age.
I hate it.
I'm not far behind you and I don't like it, either.
My oldest boy...
...would be close to 40 now. Middle-aged.
If he had lived.
You lost a son?
Two of 'em.
Went bad on me.
Or I went bad on them.
I don't know.
I can't figure it out.
You got another chance.
They're not mine.
They could be.
So as I went down to Denver with my cousin, LL.D. Grimes...
...then there was a hootchy-kootchy show goin' on.
When the fella wasn't lookin' we snuck in under the tent.
There was this gal up on the stage doin' a harem dance.
First thing I know, she dropped her dress and was naked.
- All over?
- From head to toe.
What'd she look like?
She had a belly button so big, you could've stuck your middle finger in it.
I saw my first one in Benbow, too.
Fifty years ago.
Probably the same girl.
Damned if he ain't almost human today.
He's been sleepin' better.
He's been at the bottle.
You mean there's bug juice in camp?
I seen him and Mr. Nightlinger swillin' it down last night.
Keeps it in a drawer in the chuck wagon.
Which drawer?
Come on. Hurry up. Give me that.
Come on, let's go. Hurry up.
Come on, Weedy.
Weedy, come on.
Hurry up. Everybody else is.
- You're wasting time.
- Gambling's a sin.
- So what?
- This ain't gamblin', it's stealin'.
- That's a bigger sin.
- Not if you don't get caught.
- Come on, just take one.
- Come on, Weedy, come on.
Holy shit!
Go on, Weedy, go on. Hurry up.
Watch out! Here he comes.
Innocence is wasted on me.
I don't believe in it.
What are you up to?
Nothin', Mr. Nightlinger.
Nothin' at all.
Boys are always guilty of something nasty.
What could it be this time, I wonder?
Nothin', I swear. Just standin' here talkin'.
If you're lying, remember one thing:
I could swallow each of you whole, without choking.
All I need to do is butter your heads and pin your ears back.
Hey, come on.
Hurry up.
Get goin'. Go, go.
Keep goin'.
LLook in with the liniment.
That's where my folks keep it.
- Hurry up.
- Come on.
Come on, Weedy, don't take your sweet time.
- Come on. Come on.
- Hurry up.
Hurry up, Weedy.
- Come on.
- It's not here.
- LLook around here.
- LLook over here.
Hurry up.
- Would you get goin'? We'll watch.
- Go on.
I got it.
Don't drop it.
- Hot coffee.
- Heard ya comin'.
I'm used.
That Fats!
He can sure sing those cows to sleep.
Fat boy isn't on guard. He was just here.
That's right. It's...
...Steve and Cimarron.
There's more than one voice.
What is this?
Weedy! You keep takin' long swigs like that...
...you're gonna miss your turn next time.
Pass it on.
Hey! There's two of everybody.
There's two moons.
I'm going to bed as soon as I can stand up.
Just don't wake up OI' Iron Nuts.
Mr. Brass Ass Andersen.
A bastard if there ever was one.
He made you stop stutterin' fast.
He really tromped your tail!
LListen, Fatso...
I could have given up stutterin' a long time ago.
- Why didn't ya?
- I didn't know anybody wanted me to.
This is the first time I've ever been drunk.
Oh, you gettin' sick, ya farmer?
- I've decided.
- What?
I've decided if OI' Iron Nuts tells me
I'm burnin' daylight just one more time...
...I'm gonna let him have it.
Have what?
It.
What's it?
I ain't decided yet.
What happened to that bottle?
It's coming.
You know who you sounded like just then?
Mr. Nightlinger.
That black son of a bitch cooks better than my ma.
Come on, you, we oughta be goin' before the old man finds out we're gone.
Yeah, come on.
Did ya ever notice how pink
Mr. Nightlinger's palms are?
They're kinda pretty.
Shit.
Shit yourself.
Shall we join 'em, Mr. Nightlinger?
When did you take your first drink?
It was on the occasion of my first broken heart.
And my last.
She was an older woman and wise.
Vastly experienced.
She told me she couldn't stand the sight of me for another minute...
...handed me a half-gallon jug of sour mash and fled.
And you polished it off?
Every drop.
I've been drinking sour mash ever since.
I was 17.
She was almost 22.
Her name...
...was Oceola.
I think these kids are rushin' it a little.
They're in a hurry to grow up.
Well, they won't get it out of a bottle.
They'll know that in the morning.
All down sick at once.
Must've passed a bad waterhole.
Well, this'll settle you.
Come on, son.
Back, wide.
Voila.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Mr. Nightlinger, I'd like some beans and cabbage for supper...
...with a big chunk of fatback in some red pepper sauce.
And make some gravy out of the grease.
I'll be back.
Hurry it up. We're burnin' daylight.
All right, son, tongue out.
Head back.
Wider.
Where do you think you're goin'?
Go get him, Dan.
Come back, you.
You ain't nothin' but a small child.
If you was a fish, I'd throw you back.
Hey, boys! LLook here!
LLook what I found.
LLook around and meet the boys.
It looks like he surprised us.
We surprised you, too, though, didn't we, boy?
You know better than to scream out now, don't ya?
What's the matter with you, son?
You're lookin' at me like I had two heads.
You're wonderin' where I came from, ain't ya?
You know we've been trackin' ya for days?
What have you got to say to that?
I can't hear you, son.
I can't hear you, son!
I won't say nothin'.
You're a quiet boy.
If I had a prize I'd give it to you, boy.
I like quiet boys.
Now, quiet boy...
...I'm gonna let you loose.
But, you point your ears now, son.
You won't run back to Mr. Andersen with them eyes rollin' back in your head...
...tellin' him that these bad men have been followin' us day and night.
You're not gonna say that.
You think you'll raise a commotion and get congratulated for it.
They'll pat your head and tell you what a good boy you've been.
That's not gonna do you any good, son.
You know why?
Now you listen to me careful, boy.
You know why?
Because I'm gonna come to you some night when it's real dark.
I'm gonna come to you on tiptoe...
...so you ain't never gonna be able to hear me.
And I'm gonna come to you with a knife...
...freshly sharpened on a stone...
...and I'm gonna cut you a grin down here on your neck.
It's gonna run clear across to there.
Do I make myself clear, boy?
Do I make myself clear, boy?
Is it clear to ya now? Huh?
Is it clear to ya?
- Is it clear?
- Yes, it's clear.
Go home!
No. No, I ain't gonna.
- You gotta stand watch.
- I ain't gonna.
- It's your turn.
- I ain't gonna.
Why not?
I ain't gonna.
- What's the matter, Dan?
- Nothin'. Just, just leave me alone.
Mr. Andersen, can I speak to you?
Go ahead.
Well, it's about Dan.
What about him?
He doesn't want to stand his watch.
- Is he sick?
- No, sir.
Well, did he break something?
No, sir.
To tell you the truth...
...I think he's afraid of the dark.
Come here.
What ails you, boy?
Nothin'.
- You nighthawked last night.
- Yes, sir.
- Everything went smooth.
- Yes, sir.
If you don't stand your watch, somebody goes short of sleep.
Carry your weight, boy.
Yes, sir.
I don't steal off you and you don't off me, not even a pinch of pie.
What the matter with you?
Your house is your house and my house is my house.
Mr. Nightlinger, you'd better start bein' real careful.
How does it feel to be scared?
You think I was too rough on the boy, is that it?
Yeah, that's it.
Well, I can't say I always decide right.
In that case...
...cut yourself a piece of pie.
Move easy. They're kinda jumpy.
They look funny from up here, don't they?
My glasses!
I'll get 'em for ya.
- Be careful, Charlie.
- Don't worry, I'll be all right.
Come on, come on.
Easy, boy.
Easy, easy.
Come on, boy, come on.
Come on, easy.
Easy, boy. Easy, boy.
Come on, easy.
Be real careful, Charlie.
Don't worry.
Get off him easy.
Just stop worryin'.
I found 'em!
Come on up. Hurry out of there.
Easy, Charlie, don't spook 'em.
They're crowdin' me!
Charlie!
Sometimes, it's...
...hard to understand...
...the drift of things.
This was a good boy.
He'd have been a good man.
Didn't get his chance.
Death can come for you anyplace...
...anytime.
It's never welcome, but...
...if you've done all you can do...
...and it's your best...
...in a way, I guess, you're ready for him.
Go on back to camp.
All of you.
Go on, son.
What's that?
LLittle Big Horn.
They didn't even dig him a decent grave.
Well, it's not how you're buried...
...it's how they remember ya.
I guess I better go into Fort Smith and...
...see if there's been any Sioux activity up ahead.
Keep the cattle headed due east.
Tell Mr. Nightlinger he's in charge.
Why not put me in charge?
Big mouth don't make a big man.
Cimarron, come here!
Them ladies ain't got their dresses on.
No, they ain't.
They sure are pretty.
Wonder who they are?
I don't know. LLet's go find out, huh?
Girls, come on. Come on.
Hurry up. Hurry up, get behind the wagon.
Move, move.
- 'Morning, boys.
- Ma'am.
'Morning, ma'am.
Fine morning, isn't it?
You on a drive?
Yes, ma'am, we're goin' to Belle Fourche.
Where's your headman?
That's Mr. Andersen.
He's over at Fort Smith.
All right, then.
What's your name?
They call me Cimarron.
I'm Kate to my friends.
And who's the one with the pretty pink blush?
This here's Homer.
Hello, Homer.
Ma'am.
How many men you got in your outfit,
Cimarron?
If you're going by age, we've got two that's 15.
My God!
If you're going by what we can do, there's 11 of us.
No offense.
In this kind of country a poor helpless woman likes to know...
...if there are any men around.
Men who can take care of us as we go along our way.
Well, we're gettin' paid a man's wages.
And you look man enough to earn them too, Cimarron.
Did you want me for anything,
Mrs. Collingwood?
That's Phoebe.
You're putting too much merchandise on display, Phoebe.
You better cover some of that up before you come down with pneumonia.
Isn't this a sweet-lookin' boy?
Wouldn't you like to come inside, honey?
You'd be surprised how nice we got everything fixed up.
I think that Homer just saved himself a dollar.
That leaves you.
Well, excuse me for sayin' so, ma'am.
You're old enough to be my momma.
Well, if I were, I'd teach you something.
LLike what?
LLike manners, for a start.
'Morning, ma'am.
Will you see the boys return to work while I chat with this lady?
Ma'am.
My name's Nightlinger...
...and I'm in charge of these boys.
I'm Mrs. Collingwood and...
...I'm in charge of these girls.
Well, I just heard from a highly excited youngster...
...that there were some soiled doves swinging through here.
What do you want from me?
Madam, you know young boys.
They dream of golden skin and unbound hair.
Even if I could lock them up they'd find a way of getting here.
There's very little I can do about that.
I'm sure you'd handle everything most tastefully.
It's a question of waiting for a more appropriate time in their lives.
Perhaps it would be wiser to wait until next year.
Or even the year after.
With any luck I'll be retired by then.
The first time should be in the back of a buggy with...
...a girl they think they're in love with.
All right.
We'll move on.
You're a charming and sensible lady.
What about you?
Well, I have the inclination...
...the maturity and the wherewithal...
...but unfortunately, I don't have the time.
You got 'em?
Yeah.
Can you fix it?
I think so.
Catch us by suppertime?
Do what I can.
Homer, drop out and help him.
- Mr. Andersen...
- I know.
They've been parallelin' us for the better part of an hour.
- What do you suppose they want?
- The herd.
Now you just go on about your business like you hadn't seen 'em.
I'll pass the word to the rest.
Think you can do somethin' kinda ticklish?
Sure.
I want you to fade back and...
...find Mr. Nightlinger.
What'll I tell him?
Tell him to load his gun and hightail it up here.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Andersen?
I can't find Weedy.
Well, I sent him back after Mr. Nightlinger a couple of hours ago.
I don't know where the hell they are!
LLooks like we're gonna have a cold supper.
You want me to go?
Son, I wish we could all go, but...
...we gotta stay put right here.
Here's some jerky.
Take a piece and pass it on.
As soon as it's dark...
...they'll be comin' in.
They're after the herd.
I don't know who they are or how rough they'll get.
But right now they think we're one man and a bunch of kids.
And that's what we're gonna let 'em think.
I know you're more than that, a lot more...
...but this is no time to try and prove it.
You act like you just came out of Ellen Price's grammar school and...
...you'll be all right.
Now scatter and get us some firewood.
- What's the matter with you?
- I should have told you.
Told me what?
They've been following us for a long time.
I should have told you, but I was scared.
- They said they'd kill me.
- Who said that?
The man with the long hair who came looking for work.
Don't worry, Dan. It's not your fault.
You got plenty of guts.
Now get out there and give 'em a hand gettin' that firewood.
Hello, there.
Remember what I told you.
Well, bless my soul.
If it ain't Mr. Wil Andersen of the Double-O!
We knew it was gonna take you a long time herdin' little boys and cows...
...but ain't no way we thought it was gonna take you this long.
Winter's comin' on, ol' friend...
...and we gotta get these cattle to Belle Fourche.
How far would you say it is?
I didn't say.
If you was to say.
Four or five days.
Two or three is more like it.
You know, I'm hungry.
And I remember you had a chuck wagon and a nigger.
Where are they?
They're behind us. I sent a boy back to find out what was holding him up.
Well, I know the boy.
Bring him on in here.
I don't suppose you mean this stalwart young man here, do ya?
Are you all right, boy?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Andersen...
...do I look like the kinda man to you that would beat on an innocent boy?
You look like the vermin-ridden son of a bitch you are.
Well, my sainted momma didn't think so.
You get over there and sit down.
Go on. Now!
And sit down!
And the rest of you boys, sit down, right now!
Now ol' friend...
...I'll have the gun.
That's right.
I'll also have the belt,
'cause you ain't gonna need it.
That's good.
Pick it up and bring it over to me.
I don't think you heard what I said!
I said to bend over, pick up the belt and bring it right here to me, now!
Pride.
Stubborn pride.
I admire that.
That truly is...
...an admirable quality.
To tell you the truth,
I wouldn't have picked it up, either.
Mr. Andersen...
...how much would you say that them cattle are worth apiece?
Maybe $17 a head?
Now, old friend...
...I am ready to be rich.
You, come here!
Right now! Get up!
You kept our little secret, didn't ya?
- Answer him.
- Yes, sir.
You don't listen to him anymore.
You gotta look to me now, you understand that?
- How old are you?
- I just turned 13.
Really?
By the time I was your age,
I had already killed a man.
- You done anything like that?
- No, sir.
I'll bet not.
- You're the runt of your family, ain't ya?
- Yes, sir.
Where are your glasses?
You had some glasses. Where are they?
Son, there's no glass in there.
You musta broken 'em, huh?
Say, look at that...
...I can see myself back home now.
And all them carpetbaggers calling me mister.
I'd like 'em back when you're through.
They've been in my family for a long time.
Well, you can have 'em back. Here.
All right.
We've seen what you can do with a boy.
How are you when they come a little bigger?
You mean you?
Yeah. Why don't you tell your boys to just sit this one out?
You love to make it happen, don't ya?
You havin' any of it?
Well, sir, you're...
...a pretty old man.
Yeah, I'm 30 years older than you are.
Had my back broke once and my hip twice.
And on my worst day
I could beat the hell out of you.
I don't think so.
You will.
Get away from him! Get away from him!
You're mine. All mine.
Now, come on, you get up, you son of a bitch.
You miserable wretch!
Mount up!
Stop, you son of a bitch!
Go to hell!
Turn around!
I want you to see this comin'!
I said, stop!
You're mine, you old bastard.
LLeave him alone!
Get back.
Clear back, all of you.
We're leavin'.
- What about them kids?
- They're not goin' nowhere.
Take everything but the fire.
- What happened here?
- Rustlers.
They've been followin' us since we started out.
Why would they do this to him?
Mr. Andersen put up a fight.
Ain't there anything we can do for him?
Yes, there is.
You can be men.
Mr. Nightlinger...
...you're scarin' the boys.
You wanna sit up?
No.
Could you drink some whisky?
No.
Is there anything...?
I want you to see that...
...these boys all get home.
I will.
Summer's over.
Just about.
I'm proud of ya.
All of ya.
Every man wants his...
...children to be...
...better than he was.
You are.
This may seem...
...a lonesome place to leave him.
But he's not alone.
Because...
...many of his kind rest here with him.
The prairie...
...was like a mother to Mr. Andersen.
He belonged to her.
She cared for him while he lived...
...and she's nursing him...
...while he sleeps.
What?
What are you doing?
We didn't want to do it this way, but we knew you wouldn't give 'em to us.
So, we're gonna get the herd back...
...and take it on to Belle Fourche.
You're gonna get yourselves killed.
We're gonna finish a job.
Better have a plan.
Turn me loose and we'll make one.
Cut him loose.
Dung heap!
Come on in!
What the hell's the matter with them?
Mount up!
LLook at that.
Come on.
You've been behind this all the time, ain't ya, nigger?
Not at first, but I came round to it.
You take your hat off when you talk to me, mister!
Now you're actin' mighty calm considerin' what it is I got in store for you.
What have you got to show me that I haven't seen before?
Don't you sass me, you black!
Give me that rope.
This is what?
You ever seen one of these?
You ever seen a nigger run?
Come on! Come on!
Get up! Get up!
Since you mean to hang me...
...I'd like to atone to my Maker.
You got one minute.
Speak your piece.
Where to begin?
I regret having trifled with married women.
I'm thoroughly ashamed of having cheated at cards.
I deplore my occasional departures from the truth.
Forgive me for taking Your name in vain...
...my Saturday drunkenness, my Sunday sloth.
Above all...
...forgive me for the men I've killed in anger...
...and for those I'm about to.
I think my leg is broken.
Don't let him get up.
Oh, my God, don't let him get up.
I think my leg is broke.
The other one is hung up.
You!
Son, please cut me loose.
Please!
I'll make it worth your while.
I promise.
Oh, thank you.
Don't! Don't!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Stop him!
Stop him!
They're just kids!
Now what do you want on it?
His name. Wil Andersen.
Anything else?
LLike what?
Well, it's usual to say something like,
"Rest in Peace."
"Eternal Sleep."
"In Fond Memory of..."
Was he a family man?
Did he have any children?
Yes.
Well, then I carve:
"Beloved Husband and Father."
That'd be fine.
I don't see it.
It's gotta be around here somewhere.
I remember that tree.
There must've been a heavy rain.
Washed it away.
We ain't never gonna find it now.
Come on in.
I think it's close enough.
Well, come on, we're burnin' daylight.
SURABAYA
INDONESIA
- OK Boan, how much you got here?
- About 1,800.
- What's going on?
- There's Bagley.
Mr. Bagley! Something haywire.
We haven't loaded enough pipe.
- Less than 2,000 feet.
- That'll be enough.
On Huangatan, it didn't come until we were past 26,000 feet.
This hole proves out within 2,000, or it's a write-off.
How are you this evening?
All right.
The barometer is still falling.
It's a lousy forecast all right.
We should stay here another 48 hours.
Every hour we delay gives others a chance of beating us to the island.
- I thought only we knew...
- We'll sail right away.
You'll be sorry.
All right, Mr. Carnahan, ready to let go.
- Stand by fore and aft.
- OK, haul the gangway ashore!
Let it go.
- Roy.
- Fred.
Well, here's to the big one.
Mayday, mayday.
Mayday.
I'm reminded of Amsterdam.
Ever eat a raw herring with a beer chaser and a scoop of ice cream?
- Captain here.
- I picked up a mayday call.
- It faded before I could get a fix.
- Keep listening.
Let me know if you get anything.
Like you said:
"The hell with the weather."
We can get out of this by backtracking around Timor.
- It'll only cost us a few days.
- Keep on course, I'm fine.
I gotta admit, for a New York desk guy, you got a lot of guts.
I sold this one to the board.
If that island doesn't produce huge,
I'll be wiping windshields.
Men.
Carnahan.
I'd have told you earlier, but I couldn't risk any talk.
Men, we may be sailing into the history books. Hit the lights.
I believe we're headed for the biggest oil strike ever.
- Here in the magic circle.
- It's magic all right.
Are we supposed to find oil under 2,000 fathoms of sea?
Just sea is what the charts say.
Now let's take a look a low angle.
This was taken in 1943.
This wake was left by the ship that took the photograph.
No sign of land. Here's a fog bank you wouldn't look at twice.
Let's look at another picture.
This is taken from precisely the same angle.
Same area, same fog bank.
This was taken two weeks ago.
35 years later.
A bank of fog that doesn't change a wisp in 35 years. Fantastic.
Still nothing to explore, except for one reason.
A spy satellite photographed it by mistake.
I got hold of the classified pictures via a donation to someone.
No names, but he lives on Pennsylvania Ave.
OK, fellas.
Roy Bagley, would you take over and let science make the point?
The satellite was to analyse exhaust gases from a missile test.
So it was loaded with two special kinds of film.
No, first the infrared.
The different colors represent different surface temperatures.
- You mean there's land there?
- Correct, Joe.
An island, hidden by a perpetual fog bank.
Never seen by human eye nor walked by human foot.
The infrared patterns aren't like any I've ever seen.
More surprising, though, is what the spectrograph picked up.
Chemical composition of our mysterious fog bank.
Free hydrocarbon radicals, excess nitrogen, carbon dioxide.
And, not poisonous but very damn curious...
This has to be caused by vapors seeping up through the ground.
- Vapors from petroleum deposits.
- Yes!
That island is the tip of a huge underground tankjust waiting for us.
- I'm betting everything I've got.
- I'll take 50 cents of that.
The excess CO2 might also be accounted for by animal respiration.
- Turn the lights on.
- Animal breathing.
Are you crazy?
And I'm not so sure human feet have never walked the island before.
In 1605, Fernando De Queres was blown south from Tenotang.
He wrote of the piercing the white veil. That's the cloud bank.
And landing on the beach of the skull, where he heard the roar -
- of the greatest beast...
The rest of that log entry was suppressed by Rome.
In 1749, a water-logged lifeboat was found in the same area.
It was empty, but drawn in blood on the port -
- was a likeness of a huge, slouchy humanoid thing.
And this strange warning:
"From thy wedding with the creature who touches heaven, lady, -
- God preserve thee."
I also heard of a note in a bottle from a dying Japanese in 1944...
What the hell are you talking about?
Who is this joker?
- Beats me.
- He's wearing a crew jersey.
I'll pay any fair amount for my... passage.
- You're a stowaway?
- Jack Prescott. From Princeton.
- Dept. Of Primate Paleonthology.
- You lying hippie!
You're from another oil company!
The meeting's over.
He's got one of our T-shirts.
This doesn't mean a thing. Gulf or Exxon can fix a fake passport.
- Who the hell are you?
- I am Jack Prescott...
My interest in your island has got nothing to do with oil.
You're not even a good liar. You couldn't find out where we're going.
- You bought charts!
- Come on. Who'd you pay off?
They hadn't sold charts for this area in years. A friend tipped me.
I did pick up some charts in Surabaya.
Take this spy below till he's hungry enough to stop spouting ape shit.
Let's go. Come on.
- There's something out there.
- Oh, come on!
- Honest to God, look!
- Quit horsing around.
Come back here!
There's something out there!
About 2 o'clock. Use your glasses.
Son of a bitch, it's a raft!
All stop.
She's alive!
Gently.
I've had first-aid training, Captain.
Will you all clear out of here?
- You have to undress her, huh?
- It's usual.
In case of internal injury or shock syndrome.
- Get outta here!
- Clear out.
Eye Magnate. Beverly Hills.
There's no sign of injuries anywhere.
C-Y-N-A-R-A. Sounds like a yacht.
- Careless yachtsman, to lose this.
- Remember that mayday call?
You can stop sweating. Navy record's clean, it all checks out.
Fingerprints.
The guy's kosher.
I know just how to use him, too.
The girl's about to come to. She could be hysterical, so follow me.
- Can I get a cheeseburger here?
- You went to medical school, right?
What have you got, crystal balls?
There's nothing I haven't checked.
I know the day and hour you completed your toilet training.
Now we gotta figure a way for you to work off your room and board.
- You're pretty good with a camera.
- I've snapped a few monkeys.
Congratulations.
You're now our official photographer.
Hello. Everything's fine.
You're safe and well on an American merchant vessel.
Where's Harry and everyone?
- You mean they're gone?
- Do you remember anything?
No. No.
Yeah...
I was on deck and then...
- Then I was swimming to a star.
- To a light.
Let her call it a star.
The life-raft was blown over board near you. It had an automatic flare.
I'm Fred Wilson, I'm in charge.
The yacht didn't get very far after the SOS.
The radio reported that someone found a piece of charred hull.
We're sorry, ma'am.
So am I.
Harry had discovered me.
He was going to put me in a movie he was making in Hong Kong.
Dumb luck.
But I guess I really can't complain.
When you're alone adrift in the Pacific and somebody just...
- Who spotted me, by the way?
- That young fellow.
How can I ever thank you?
I'm Dwan.
D-W-A-N. That's my name.
Like Dawn, -
- except that I switched two letters to make it more memorable.
- I'm a mere Jack.
- You must be kidding.
How could anybody who saved my life be mere to me?
You need some rest.
I haven't had a good one of those in years.
- Are we headed back to Singapore?
- Not directly, ma'am.
I guess it doesn't matter.
I'm in no rush.
Harry probably wouldn't have put me in that movie anyhow.
Oh, my God!
What a meaningful miracle!
- I owe my life to a movie.
- Is that so?
I swear to God.
Harry was showing this film that I refused to watch.
That's why I was up on deck when the yacht exploded.
Did you ever meet anyone whose life was saved by "Deep Throat"?
Come on, men, let her rest.
Maybe my luck has changed.
You know something?
I always wondered how Cortés felt when he first saw the Inca treasure.
It was Pizarro, and he died busted.
Here we go...
Solid land all right.
This is its profile east to west.
Typical Pacific formation...
This would be the slope at the beach, the mountainous sector at the west.
Let's get in closer.
- What was that?
- Just a glitch.
- False echo off a flock of birds.
- Spot anything unusual?
- Not a thing.
- Look at the screen, Fred.
All those going ashore, report to the companionway.
Hi there.
How do you like this for beach wear?
Fantastic. I'm afraid you can't come ashore, though.
Wait a minute.
You said I could come on the first boat.
You should wait till the recon is gone.
You want full coverage of this landing, don't you?
I must be in it. The all-American girl saved from a yacht -
- by "Deep Throat".
- Don't print those, I'm married.
- Guaranteed to be on People Magazine.
- Print just one.
- Really, Mr. Wilson...
I need a break, and you owe it to me.
Because I am a holder of a Petrox credit card. I really am!
Ask your computer.
I may be late on my payments, but you take 18% interest plus charges.
Dwan, you come ashore with us.
Captain, she'll come ashore.
Good luck. As soon as you get through, get on the horn.
Hey, Jack? Maybe it's him.
Fred Wilson.
I had my horoscope done before I flew to Hong Kong.
- It said that I was...
- Here you go.
It said that I was going to cross over water -
- and meet the biggest person in my life.
That's interesting. The current is
18 degrees cooler than the air.
- What does that mean?
- The fog might lift at the edge.
Crossing 20 fathoms.
Shallowing rapidly.
Standing up ahead.
I think I hear breakers.
Shore boat to Explorer.
There's a curtain around the island.
We just broke through.
There's a beach dead ahead.
In two words: No problem.
Let me get down! I haven't touched the ground in weeks.
That's good.
Jack! I'm coming ashore.
Wait, hold it. All right.
Beautiful.
Let's start getting a line on this island. Bring the mosquito spray!
We won't have to start wondering which way to go.
You want to start setting seismic charges this morning?
- Yes. Got to knock the stucture.
- All right, move out!
There's a waterfall ahead!
Last one to get in is a rotten egg.
Don't go running off anymore.
We'll wait here for them.
Just stick close by me, OK?
Holy Mother!
That looks as old as the pyramids.
Could be. But the pyramids weren't repaired six months ago.
There's earth on those timbers. It has to be replaced after each monsoon.
Are you telling me there's people here?
What's more, I'll characterize them.
Scared people.
- Scared of what?
- I don't exactly what it is.
But apparently, they thought they needed a wall to keep it out.
Let me straighten you out on a couple of points.
One: This wall is an ancient ruin.
Two: The island is uninhabited.
And three: There's an uninhabited
German beer hall in there.
Let's go.
Fred? Look down there.
Take your binoculars.
- What?
- Down there, that pool.
- Do you think it could be?
- The surface seems viscous.
It sure as hell could be oil.
Sweet Jesus! Rockefeller!
- Maybe it's a wedding.
- A good guess.
It's scheduled for the night when the moon's full.
Where's the groom?
See the one in the ape mask?
You might say that's the groom's stand-in.
The groom is on the other side of the wall.
You mean it's bad luck if they see each other before the wedding?
Ghastly luck for the whole congregation.
Oh, Christ!
You want to talk for us?
I'll try.
Shoot in the air only.
What's he bitching about?
He's probably telling us we've contaminated their magic.
No.
Remember, in the air.
What is it?
He wants to make a deal.
Six of them for Dwan.
Tell them that I like him, too, but not that way.
In the air!
- You'll have trouble with the chief.
- I will buy the chief.
What have we got that wogs go for?
Radios, pots and pans, all sorts of junk.
This is no longer the 19th century.
You can't just grab their island.
I'll check that with the UN.
In the meantime -
- we scare them into the boondocks with a July 4th number.
Are your men ready to set the charges?
Kong! Kong!
You heard him chant.
He exists. You saw the wall.
Who do you think they were planning to give the girl to?
It's some nutty religion.
A priest dresses up and gets laid.
We'll humor Jack.
Take plenty of TNT.
Any sign of a monkey bigger than four feet, send it bang-bang.
- You wouldn't.
- Bet me.
Even you wouldn't be asshole enough to wipe out a unique new species.
The kids would burn every
Petrox gas station in the country.
- He could be right.
- Kong, Kong, Kong...
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to steal a boat.
- Seriously?
- As soon as I've swiped supplies.
- I'm going on a camera hunt.
- That sounds dangerous.
It's a chance of a lifetime. You either grab it or you're dead meat.
You shouldn't go ashore tonight.
It's not a good night for Aries.
How did you know I was an Aries?
By the shape of your ears.
All right, I asked Fred Wilson.
He knows everything about you.
- I really wish you wouldn't go.
- Is it better to watch an old movie?
There's nothing else to do.
Use your imagination.
80 times around the deck is a mile. We could jog.
I guess my camera hunt can wait a couple of hours.
Excuse me, I'll just finish stealing in the galley.
You'll disappoint me if you're here when I get back.
- What do you mean?
- I hope you'll wait in your cabin.
Here you are, son.
Get it out right away.
All right.
I said that pool might be oil.
We can't be sure...
Think positive. Guys who think negative don't get far at Petrox.
"Has to be the biggest ever.
No problems at all."
- Well, you're the boss.
- Don't worry about it, Roy.
Help!
Help me!
No!
We're too late.
Set off the show.
- Help him with that bolt.
- Cover the gate.
Get on the other side!
Pull!
Open that gate!
The lights will hold him back!
Don't shoot.
- He's taken her.
- No one's taken her.
Who do you think went through there, some guy in an ape suit?
- You all right?
- I just fell in a Goddamn hole.
No, you didn't.
You're not in a hole.
That's a footprint.
Carnahan here. We've gone over two miles. There's still no sign of her.
- It's better than finding remains.
- Unless he's gobbled her down.
Give me that thing.
Most jungle apes eat only fruit.
Most jungle apes don't have a size-90 foot.
The men have had it.
I'm going to pitch camp.
Are you a bunch of old ladies?
Come on.
Keep moving.
Carnahan's right.
It makes more sense to stop.
All right, Carnahan.
You know the drill.
We'll plant seismic charges for mapping and fire rockets...
- Right, right!
- Will somebody be on the radar?
Any large, furry blimp seen moving in your direction, you'll know.
That footprint measured 6.4 feet.
If that were for real.
How high would that make him?
Multiplied by about eight, I guess.
He'd make a hell of a commercial.
"The battles we at Petrox fight to fill your tank."
If he's not going to eat her, why did he take her?
Apes are very territorial.
He'll probably take her to his turf.
What for?
Joe said you said that the ape was going to marry her.
- Is that some kind of joke or...
- I don't know, Carnahan!
I'm as ignorant as you. Quit asking me so many dumb questions.
I can't stand heights.
Honest I can't. When I was ten I got sick in the Empire State Building.
Put me down!
You put me down!
You put me down!
Put me down.
Please put me down.
You Goddamn chauvinist pig ape!
What are you waiting for?
You wanna eat me?
Then go ahaed! Do it!
Go ahead and eat me!
Go ahead! Choke on me!
I didn't mean that.
Sometimes I get too physical.
It's a sign of insecurity, like when you knock down trees.
Such a nice ape.
Such a nice, sweet monkey.
We're going to be great friends.
I'm a Libra, what sign are you?
No, don't tell me.
I'll bet you're an Aries.
Of course you are.
I think that's just wonderful.
Help me!
Help me!
Radar had him on the screen.
3.6 kilometres west of your flare.
He moved in a random manner.
- Not in our direction?
- Affirmative. Random. Like a circle.
Maybe he's lost her. She got away and he's searching for her.
Carnahan! Wait a minute!
- Have you set seismic charges?
- The men are doing it now.
- Don't move until it's finished.
- He's nuts.
The girl might be running for her life from a gigantic turned-on ape.
I know how you feel.
But there's an energy crisis.
We must all rise above our self-interests.
- You hypocritical bastard...
- Save your wind, he's signed off.
Let's get going.
I ain't busting my ass for no whites.
OK. Who gives a shit that the ape's headed in our direction?
- There's Roy.
- Well, Fred...
I finished testing the samples from that pool.
- It'll be real great oil!
- Son of a bitch!
Fred Wilson is crazy, is he?
Wait till those candy-asses in New York hear about this.
- I'll grind them...
- Like I said, it will be great oil.
As soon as Mother Nature finishes cooking it a little longer.
How much longer?
Hardly a tick of clock, in geological terms. Say 10,000 years.
Till then you'd get better mileage filling your Cadillac with mule piss.
Oh, my God!
I hate to kick a fella when he's dead, but I told you.
You shouldn't have told New York you were bringing in the big one.
The big one. Jesus!
Who says I ain't gonna?
Wilson to Explorer.
Get me a channel to Surabaya,
I want an engineer drop.
OK, Jack, you go first.
- Come on, it's solid as a rock.
- OK, let's go.
- Stop firing!
- Jack!
Boan! Try to make it back.
I'm going on.
All hands, stand by for recovery.
- Over and out.
- Recharge the batteries.
- Air drop done, right on target.
- Perfect. Haul your asses.
Get that equipment working.
- You think I'm crazy?
- You said it.
If I had found oil, Gulf, Shell, Exxon would be crawling all over here.
Not this one, pal.
Kong is all me and Petrox.
A Fred S. Wilson exclusive.
Move your ass, Shorty.
You think it'll ring the bell?
Promise oil, bring back a monkey?
Look at Exxon's
"We'll Put a Tiger in Your Tank".
Beach green to Carnahan.
Report back immediately.
Do nothing to endanger Kong.
Acknowledge.
Carnahan, do you read me?
Do you read me?
Give us a hand over here.
Wilson!
Still no contact with Carnahan.
- The radio's not working. No sweat.
- I want to take out a search party.
- I can't spare any men.
- Six guys are cut off in the bush.
And you're building monkey traps.
You're playing with their lives.
Don't worry about it.
Boan!
Where's the others?
Come on, Kong, forget about me.
This is never going to work.
Can't you see?
Jack!
We've got to do it.
Are you ready?
Radar update. Monkey spotted
1,800 yards west by north-west -
- heading 0-89, velocity 2.2 miles per hour.
Estimated time to your position, five minutes or less.
Kill the lights.
Everybody clear out!
- Logan, how are you doing?
- Almost finished. One minute more.
- That's enough.
- All set, Mr. Bagley!
- Ready, Boan?
- OK. It's hot now.
Are you sure that monkey will be able to bust through that gate?
Pull back the bolt halfway.
- Come on.
- I can't.
Open the gate! Help!
- Help!
- Jack!
It's Prescott, open the gate.
Come on!
Close the bolt!
Wilson, blow the Goddamn thing!
Still want to play?
Dwan! Congratulations.
Hey, Jack.
Do I look different?
- Yeah, you shine.
- That's right.
- I'm a star.
- It's all set.
Coast-to-coast tour. We open in
New York. Lights, cameras, Kong!
And probably Nureyev and Fontaine.
I want Balanchine to choreograph
"The Beauty and the Beast".
Any chance of you two getting married?
I don't know.
This is so sudden.
We could think of some nutty way of Kong giving away the bride.
It'd be tough to get him to do it.
Probably just old-fashioned, huh?
I don't know.
What do you think, Jack?
Christ.
After all these years,
I'll finally end up with a shrink.
How can I become a star because of someone -
- that was stolen off that gorgeous island and locked up in that tank?
It's not someone. It's an animal that tried to rape you.
That's not true.
He risked his life to save me.
He tried to rape you, honey.
Ask the natives what they thought of losing Kong.
- They'll miss him a lot.
- Like leprosy.
You're dead wrong. He was the terror, the mystery of their lives.
A year from now, the island will be full of burned-out drunks.
When we took Kong, we kidnapped their god.
It's like there's a curse on all of us.
I'm tired of your trying to confuse this girl.
This is her big chance. And yours.
There's stars at Princeton -
- just like in Hollywood. You want me to get Kong another keeper?
Coast-to-coast tours?
"Beauty and the Beast"? It's a farce.
Just say the word and your contract is torn up. Tell me right now.
See you opening night.
Oh, God,
I'm tired of thinking.
- The ape had the right idea.
- What's that?
Wait a minute.
I'll be right back.
All hands on deck!
Fire detail, report to the control room.
This is the captain.
Sea water pumps to full pressure.
Prepare to flood tank No. 4.
I'm ordering the ape drowned.
Hey, Kong! Here I am.
Do you remember me?
Remember your blind date?
You haven't forgotten, have you?
Dwan! Come back here!
He's going berserk.
- Stop, or I'll jump.
- Dwan, please.
- You can't help him now.
- Don't come any closer.
OK.
Hey, Kong? Why are you waking up all these people?
No one's going to hurt you.
You're just going to be a star.
Don't flood the tank! She fell in.
You could've...
Jack! I'm so glad to see you.
- What is it? You're not dressed.
- That's right.
I was wrong when I called this thing a farce, it's a tragedy.
- I'm quitting your circus, Fred.
- You signed a contract.
- You took an advance.
- I donated it in your name.
To the SPCA Fund for Sending
Kong Home. Here's your receipt.
- Sue me.
- Don't leave me tonight, please.
- My horoscope says...
- Shut up. I love you.
Come with me right now.
The hell with the contract.
Go ahead. But I promise you you'll never get another booking.
You'll end up tap-dancing at rotary clubs.
- Don't you understand?
- Yeah...
I do. Sorry.
Stay well.
Ladies and gentlemen of our TV-satellite audience, -
- you are seeing this live around the world- 
- as it is happening here in New York City.
You have better seats than these lucky King Kong contest winners.
Thus, Beauty set foot on the forbidden island and was seized.
Great was the fear as Beauty was lashed -
- to the dreadful bridal altar of the Beast.
Now the earth booms.
Kong's power!
Superpower!
Hail the power!
That's the power of Kong, and Petrox!
No! Don't push her around!
Ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing to fear!
That is an escape-proof cage certified by the city government.
Come on out! Easy.
His feet are still chained.
It's all right. Come on.
We're in position.
The Queensboro Bridge is buttoned up. What's the situation at Brooklyn?
I'll tell that monkey to spread before he crosses it.
Come on, there's a train coming.
Hit the lights.
This is a message to all traffic.
Clear all streets.
Proceed to shelters.
Repeating: Clear all streets. Any person found looting will be shot.
Keep running.
Jack! Buy me a drink, will you?
Come on, buy me a drink.
Ten more blocks and we've got the key to a great apartment.
We've put a river between us.
The bridges are mined, and apes don't swim. Your book says so.
Please, buy me a drink.
Buy me a drink over there.
OK.
What's the matter?
Déjà vu. I don't know where, but I've seen this view before.
Here.
We don't want to get shot as looters.
OK, get smashed.
How about that nice offer you made me? Do you still want me?
Look, chinchilla.
Looks great on you.
I asked you a question.
- You know what I earn?
- Do you think I need furs?
Yes. Excitement is in your blood like dope.
You're going to need new fixes
I'm not able to give you.
Don't be stupid.
It's OK.
Probably some National Guardsman ran his tank into a powerhouse.
Do you remember that black-out?
And all the babies born exactly nine months later?
Well, here's to all the future sons and daughters of King Kong.
I'll drink to that.
The hell with furs. Tell me, does that nice offer still stand?
It depends on Kong. He's bigger than both of us, know what I mean?
Don't tease me, I'm serious.
Of course. I know where I've seen that view before.
I think we've got a chance. Sit tight,
I've got to make a phone call.
Keep it down, everyone.
What do you think?
Is he flipped out or not?
Hello? Hello...
Excuse me, Professor. You say you know where Kong is headed.
Yes.
You can trap him without danger.
Get some helicopters and blasting nets on top of him.
No problem. Where is he headed,
Professor Prescott?
Promise me to capture him without injury and I'll tell you.
- Do we have a deal?
- Yes, Professor.
Where is Kong heading?
A place in Manhattan that looks exactly like his natural habitat.
Let him climb to the top of the World Trade Center.
Jack!
He's coming down Fifth Avenue on schedule.
The power is back on.
Keep quiet, get in the shadows.
No.
Hold on! Close your eyes!
The helicopters are coming to net him!
Hold on!
Kong...
What are those men doing up there?
Didn't they get my orders?
The rotten bastards!
He's still got the girl. Follow me in a tight holding pattern.
No! Don't put me down.
Hold on to me.
Hold on to me, or they'll kill you.
Now!
Oh, God.
Wait.
Hold on to me.
Please don't let me go.
Don't kill him!
Don't kill him!
Assholes!
Kong.
Dwan!
Jack!
Jack!
I hope our new Commander-in-Chief isn't the coward they say he is.
Whatever they say, Yamamoto is the kind of leader we need.
He believes in the value of the airplane.
But why a Vice-Navy Minister for such an important position?
Maybe the climate in Tokyo was detrimental to Yamamoto's health.
The Army is against him for opposing their policies.
So he runs away to sea. Now he has the entire fleet to guard him.
This order makes you
Commander-in-Chief.
The Imperial fleet consists of...
Save your breath, Yoshida.
Those details are in the documents.
You haven't changed!
With the Army controlling politics...
...your job as Navy Minister will be difficult.
Thank God you're here.
We know your life has been threatened.
I'm not that easy to kill.
Army hotheads are demanding an alliance with Germany.
That would be tragic for Japan.
As Navy Minister I will...
...continue to fight with the Army.
You are our last hope, Yoshida.
The Navy must stand firm against the alliance.
America is against the war we are waging in China...
...and angry that we are negotiating with the Germans.
Now we are threatened with an embargo of the raw materials we need.
Either we improve relations with the U.S. and withdraw from China...
...or find another source of raw materials here in Indo-China.
Why worry about threats from America?
President Roosevelt’s attention is on Europe...
...where Germany is winning a quick victory over the Allied Armies.
Now is the time to strike.
The British, the Dutch and the French are withdrawing their forces...
...from Southeast Asia to strengthen their armies in Europe.
We must be careful.
The Americans have an Army in the Philippines...
...and they have moved their Pacific
Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor.
Yes, and that fleet is a knife leveled at Japan's throat.
The Japanese ambassador just arrived.
He should be up shortly.
Thank you.
The Japanese are stalling, Henry.
You know that.
When Nomura took over as ambassador...
...I had some hopes of settling our differences.
But our meetings so far have been unproductive.
He brings me proposals,
I offer compromises.
He brings me counterproposals, and so on.
I tell you, Henry,
Nomura was sent here to buy time.
That's what he's doing, at our expense.
The president believes him to be a man of honor...
...that we can trust and deal with.
Mr. Ambassador, we meet again.
It is always a pleasure.
I assume you know Mr. Stimson, the head of our War Department.
Oh, yes, of course.
Mr. Ambassador.
I do hope, Mr. Stimson...
...your presence here does not indicate anything ominous.
Of course not, Mr. Nomura.
Mr. Nomura, won't you please sit down?
Thank you.
Well, since our last talk a week ago...
...I have received certain...
...shall we say...
...questions from my government...
...to put to you to clarify certain matters.
Good morning, Colonel.
There it is.
This machine let's us intercept every word between Tokyo...
...and all Japanese embassies.
The coded material is fed into that machine.
It goes round and round in there...
...and comes out here, decoded in Japanese.
All we have to do is translate it.
We decode this quicker than the Japanese embassy...
...right here in Washington.
No wonder you decided to call it
"Operation Magic."
- The latest intercept, sir.
- Thank you.
Things are getting a little hotter in the Pacific.
As long as we're sharing this assignment...
...take a look at this.
Behold the 12 apostles.
The chosen few are authorized to see the magic intercepts.
Hap Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps, isn't on the list.
No, and not one of our overseas commanders.
Excellent!
Who is in command of those torpedo planes?
Lt. Commander Fuchida, sir, from the carrier Akagi.
Send him this message from me.
"Congratulations on brilliant torpedo attack."
If we are forced into a war with America...
...Japan's only hope...
...is to annihilate the American Pacific fleet at the outset.
I wonder if we could use torpedo planes at Pearl Harbor?
Stand by.
Execute.
Look at that entrance to the harbor.
Sink one good-sized ship in the channel and you've bottled up our whole fleet.
You know as well as I do, this harbor is a mousetrap.
Fleet should have stayed in San Diego where it belongs.
I made the mistake to point that out to Roosevelt.
We're expected to obey orders.
We're also expected to exercise our own good judgement.
I didn't ask for the job.
Sorry, Kim, but this was my command, and it's become habit...
...to worry about the security of the fleet.
The British, flying some old biplanes...
...torpedoed and sank three Italian battleships at Taranto.
- Harbor very much like this one.
- Well...
...I share your concern, but CNO doesn't think it can happen here.
Why not?
A torpedo dropped from a plane plunges...
...to a depth of 75 feet or more before it levels off.
I know, and Pearl is only
40 feet deep.
I'm still worried, Kim.
Frankly, sir, I was stunned when I heard of your proposal.
You think the plan is reckless?
You suggest using torpedo planes against the American Fleet...
...but Pearl Harbor is too shallow for that.
Taranto is also a shallow harbor...
...but the British torpedoed and sank three Italian battleships there.
I know as well as you do that my plan is a gamble.
And it's risky, but we have no choice.
What I need immediately is a plan for such an attack.
Then we should consult with Genda...
...the new Air Staff Officer on the Akagi, a superb strategist.
Yes, I remember Genda.
We'll talk to him.
Glad to see you, Genda.
So this is the new Zero?
Type 21, with folding wings.
This means we can carry more fighters now.
This Zero is fast, manoeuvrable and has a long cruising range.
Better than the Messerschmitt or Spitfire?
Definitely. I've seen both in combat over London.
You outrank me, so it must be true.
Now that you're Staff Officer here, things will be tough.
You don't have to worry, you won't be here.
You're going to the Third Fleet with a promotion.
The Commander-in-Chief must think you're good!
Of course he does!
And I've got proof!
Here is his telegram.
Want to read it?
Ten-hut!
Do the planes have to be parked like that?
Way at the edge of the field.
Standard dispersal procedure, General.
In case of enemy air attack.
There are 130,000 Japanese on this island.
Our main problem is sabotage.
It'd be too easy for enemies to sneak in at night...
...and blow up every one of them if they're left out there.
Make a note, Fielder.
We'll have to make changes.
Yes, sir.
Ten-hut.
- Yes?
- Admiral Halsey's here to see you.
Send him in, please.
Blast me, break me, court-martial me, draw and quarter me...
...if you think they're gonna send my ships...
...on convoy duty in the Atlantic.
Kim, I think they've gone nuts in Washington.
How will I fight a task force if they send ...
...my ships to the Atlantic?
That damn ocean is a swimming hole compared to the Pacific.
What are we, a fighting fleet, or are these toy boats out here...
...so the Japs can buy them at Christmas?
All right, Bill, now ease it off.
It's not just you.
They asked for some of our tankers too.
How do they expect to feed these wagons...
...parked out here on this land-locked duck pond?
You're still planning on rotating half of them at sea?
I was.
Look, Kim, you've got to make them understand what's going on out here.
I'm gonna do everything I can, Bill.
Even go to the president.
By God, I knew there was at least one man...
...in this man's Navy who hadn't gone nuts.
"Gandhi" is still in hiding, sir.
A strange man, he works in his cabin like a hermit.
But he should be here.
Watanabe, go and ask him to join us.
When "Gandhi" concentrates on a plan, he is lost to this world.
Please don't bother me!
This is important...
...so I'm not going.
Genda's plan for attacking
Pearl Harbor...
...is foolproof. It's brilliant!
He stresses the importance of combat aircraft.
Just think of it.
We use six aircraft carriers...
...torpedo planes...
...high-level bombers, dive bombers.
Zero fighters for cover...
...go by the northern route, use the new torpedoes...
...we attack on a weekend.
Genda has thought of everything...
...refuelling...
...the weather....
And we go on to say,
"It should be noted that Japan ...
...has never preceded hostile action by a declaration of war.
We have concluded it possible that a fast-rated ...
...Japanese carrier force may arrive in Hawaii with no prior warning...
...from our intelligence service.
The most favourable time to the enemy would be dawn.
He probably would employ a maximum of six carriers...
...strike on a weekend.
- We recommend that the Air Corps..."
- I read it.
Yes, sir.
I appreciate the work that you and General Martin have put in.
These reports are very useful to General Short and myself.
General Martin, you don't pull any punches, do you?
"We recommend that the Air Corps...
...maintain a thorough
360-degree search...
...of the Hawaiian area during daylight.
This will require a force of
180 B-17 airplanes."
We can't search the sea approaches...
...unless we have the planes, sir.
One hundred and eighty B-17s?
For God's sakes, that's more than the number existing in the States.
It looks fine on paper, but that's not a paper fleet out there.
Squadron from the Enterprise.
Bill Halsey's working the tails off his men.
Wish we had more like him.
Makes the most of what he's got.
Doesn't keep asking for the moon.
Well, not one bomb anywhere near the target for the past hour.
Your pilots can see it, I suppose.
- Who's next?
- It's Anderson, sir.
Now, that's more like it.
- Maybe your boys finally get it.
- I hope so, sir.
Who's next?
Lieutenant Dickenson.
Tell Lieutenant Dickenson for me...
...he couldn't hit a bull in the butt with a bass fiddle.
Yes, sir.
Ten-hut.
- Carry on.
- Carry on.
This it?
Yes, sir. Our new radar.
It's a remarkable scientific achievement...
...capable of spotting an intruder on the sea or in the air...
...and at quite a range.
- Now, listen, Colonel, as you know, we're short on patrol planes.
We're gonna have to rely on this...
...thing to detect the enemy.
General, radar should do the job.
What's it doing here, not set up?
We're about to truck it up that mountain.
That peak up there is the ideal spot to put our main radar post.
At that height, we'd be clear of all interference.
Obviously.
But, sir, we can't get permission to put her up there.
Permission?
From the National Park Service
Department of Interior.
See, all of this belongs to the Hawaiian National Park.
The Hawaiian National Park?
Yes, sir. The Wildlife Preservation
Society is raising hell too.
And we can't get permission?
No, sir.
Not unless we want to fight them.
Fight them? You're damn right we're gonna fight them.
- Now you make a note of that, Fielder.
- Yes, sir.
Wildlife Preservation Society.
I feel like a damn fool.
Without even consulting me...
...our Army has decided to occupy Indo-China.
There is no hope for peace now.
I've said it before and I’ll keep on saying it...
...if we fight the Americans, we can't stop at Hawaii or San Francisco.
We'll have to march into Washington...
...and dictate peace terms in the White House!
Army hotheads who speak so lightly of war should think about that!
As I'm no longer Minister of the Navy,
I can do nothing.
I'm sorry.
Don't blame yourself.
The Army leaders are at fault, not you.
I must get back to the fleet.
There is a lot to be done.
It's no use, Hal.
I spoke to General Miles.
He took it up with General Marshall.
The order stands.
The president is off the ultra List.
Incredible.
Withholding information from the president.
Security found a copy of an intercept in a wastebasket at the White House.
Truth is, the brass don't trust some men close to the president.
Does anyone trust anyone anymore?
- Do you even trust your own wife?
- Do you?
Come to think of it, I believe I do.
Part two of No. 1390, Colonel.
Tokyo to embassies in Washington and Berlin.
Thank you, Miss Cave.
The Japanese are moving south to occupy French Indo-China.
- This is big trouble.
- Yeah.
Well, ultra list or not...
...someone has to tell the president about this one.
"Therefore, we will impose a full embargo...
...on all trade with Japan.
We do not anticipate immediate hostile action by Japan...
...but you get this information...
...so you may take appropriate precautionary measures."
"Appropriate precautionary measures."
What the hell does that mean?
Now, this is signed jointly by General Marshall and Admiral Stark.
Until we know how the Japanese will react, we're not gonna take chances.
- We go on full alert.
- Yes, sir.
Stark says they don't anticipate hostile action.
Why send a warning at all?
Damn it.
Damn it, why can't Washington give us the full inside story?
I'd sooner form my own opinion.
"Don't anticipate hostile action."
Well, all right, we'll go ahead.
Increase air and sub patrols, alert senior commanders.
Maybe out of this we can find out how well we can function.
Kaminsky.
This is Captain Earle.
Going on full alert.
Yes, captain.
We're going on full alert.
Notify all ship, sub and air patrols.
What the hell is going on here?
What are you doing?
Carrying out orders.
General Short's concern is sabotage.
All aircraft not ready for flight from now on...
...will be parked in the center...
...so they can be kept under guard.
Suppose there's an air raid.
They hit one plane, and it all goes up in flames.
I'm sorry. General's orders.
Today's war games...
...of a theoretical attack on Pearl Harbor...
...clearly show the need for six carriers in the attack force.
The General Staff...
...wants to limit us to only three carriers.
We must have six!
If we reduce our striking force...
...from six carriers to only three...
...our mission will fail.
Before attacking anything else, we should attack our General Staff.
We believe in aircraft, but they cling to the ancient theory...
...that decisive naval engagements must be fought between battleships.
Unless we dispel this myth...
...we'll never get their approval.
They are not the only believers in the "battleship theory."
Many officers here today also support the idea.
I'm one of them. We'll soon have two new unsinkable battlewagons...
...each with a displacement of
65,000 tons and huge guns.
Anything that floats can be sunk!
The "unsinkable" ship is a myth.
The war in Europe is being decided by the airplane.
There can be no νictory on land or sea, without control of the air!
I have been chosen to command this task force.
And I consider this operation risky.
How can we travel 3500 miles to Hawaii without being detected?
This mission will fail unless we achieve complete surprise.
My ships can't carry fuel for a trip there and back.
Stopping to refuel increases the possibility of detection.
I am confident that our ships will reach Hawaii safely.
You are too cautious. The case for using six carriers is sound.
To criticize the plan is defeatist!
No more bickering! As long as I am Commander-in-Chief...
...Pearl Harbor will be attacked!
I am aware that this is a dangerous gamble.
But we can't afford the luxury of playing it safe now!
Gentlemen, whether we adopt this plan or not is no longer an issue.
Let us now decide how best to carry it out.
Fuchida's back! Fuchida's back!
Fuchida! What a surprise!
I'm your new Air Commander, so treat me well.
You're joking. How did you rate another promotion?
Well, exceptional people get exceptional treatment!
This ship is crawling with Admirals.
Something important must be happening.
We have called you here...
...to explain the purpose of a new training program.
This, of course, is a matter of strictest secrecy.
It looks just like Pearl Harbor, doesn't it?
And that area down there looks like Ford island, eh?
Beautiful!
Navy pilots attract geisha girls but they frighten the fish.
It's not an ideal radar sight, but at least we got a permit.
Let's get the other units working.
Easier said than done.
What do you mean?
We have to get all six units adjusted and link them by phone to headquarters.
That means training men to operate an information center...
...so they know what to do with the information.
Take it easy, Murph.
- You'll figure it out.
- Yeah, I'll figure it out.
Don't just stand there.
You know how to operate this thing.
We know the theory.
Let's put that theory into practice.
- Switch on.
- Yes, sir.
Stay put and keep watching the screen.
In two hours, close down.
I'll send a truck to pick you up.
Excuse me, sir, but what are we watching for?
Anything unusual.
Any large blip coming from the sea.
Colonel, if we do spot something, what do we do?
Report it to headquarters, damn it.
- How, sir?
- What?
We haven't got a telephone, sir.
There's a gas station a mile down the road.
They must have a phone.
We got 183 combat planes on this base, General.
The way they're parked now, a one-eyed monkey hanging from a balloon...
...could scatter them to hell with one hand grenade.
General Short gave the order.
Come in.
- Sir, Lieutenants Taylor and Welch.
- Okay, send them in.
You two men get in your planes and fly over to Haleiwa.
Yes, sir.
What are our orders when we get there?
Just sit tight.
Listen for the phone. That's all.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Haleiwa is one of the subsidiary fields.
We send those two up there, two more here.
Only way I know to disperse a few of the planes.
If I'd get away with it, I'd send all to the neighbour islands.
- You know why we're being transferred.
- Them poker games.
- Been winning too often.
- Yeah.
Some sucker loses his shirt, so he bitches to the General.
That's it.
It's hard to believe the Emperor agreed...
...to fix a date by which the final decision must be made...
...between war and peace.
His majesty's signature is a mere formality.
The cabinet is responsible for all matters of national policy.
The Emperor recently read a poem to his Ministers to show how he feels.
"If all people are brethren...
...then why are the winds and the waves so restless?"
"If all people are brethren...
...then why are the winds and the waves so restless?"
This clearly shows how much the Emperor wants to avoid a war.
Yes, he has urged us to solve our differences with Washington.
But, sir, the deadline is October.
Can a solution be found by then?
Perhaps. But if we fail...
...if war does come...
...tell me frankly, from the Navy's Viewpoint...
...what are our chances against the Americans?
If we must, we can raise havoc with them for a year.
After that, I can guarantee nothing.
Mr. Prime Minister, I hope you will continue the negotiations.
Please remember, there is no last word in diplomacy.
Tokyo has ignored my repeated inquiries...
...and still has made no reply...
...to the compromise proposals offered by Secretary Hull.
The war that I have dreaded for so long...
...may soon become a reality.
Nomura has offered his resignation several times.
But Tokyo won't let him quit.
Instead they're sending a second ambassador, Kurusu, to help him out.
Do you really think this Kurusu can do any good?
Well, I doubt it, Frank.
He's hardly the most tactful choice.
When he was ambassador in Berlin...
...he signed the Axis Pact on behalf of Japan.
You will sail from Hittakopu Bay on November 26 under my strict orders.
The code, "Climb Mt. Niitaka" will be confirmation to go on.
We have tentatively set the date for the attack...
...on Sunday, December 7th,
Hawaiian time.
But you must understand that we are still negotiating in Washington.
If a peaceful solution is found...
...the fleet will be recalled at once.
Once at sea, to turn back would be a disgrace!
It would destroy the morale of the men!
They're in a high state of readiness, physically and psychologically.
Enough! If any commander is inclined to reject an order to return...
...when the path for peace is open...
...let him resign now!
Finally, gentlemen...
...many misinformed Japanese...
...believe that America is a nation divided, isolationist...
...and that Americans are only interested...
...in enjoying a life of Luxury...
...and are spiritually and morally corrupt.
But that is a great mistake.
If war becomes inevitable...
...America would be the most formidable foe that we have ever fought.
I've lived in Washington and studied at Harvard...
...so I know the Americans are a proud and just people.
- You sick or something?
- No.
I've been piecing together this batch of new intercepts.
- A frightening picture is taking shape.
- Oh?
Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu asked their government...
...to extend a deadline for suspending negotiation between Japan and America.
- You remember that?
- Yeah.
Now, according to this latest intercept...
...Tokyo wants to conclude negotiations with us...
...no later than November 29...
...after which, and I quote:
"Things are automatically going to happen."
Now...
...look at this intelligence report from the British.
Five Japanese troop transports with naval escort...
...were sighted off Formosa, heading south.
We've been monitoring their fleet.
Most of it seems to be on home waters.
I'm not so sure.
I'd make a bet they're going to attack us.
Japan is going to attack us.
The 29th is only four days off.
The 30th is on a Sunday.
We're gonna be attacked on Sunday, the 30th of November.
The pieces fit together.
But can you prove it?
No. But I'm convinced I'm right.
Miss Cave? Get me General Marshall.
Oh, General Marshall's at Fort Benning, sir.
Then get me the secretary of war.
I've got the evidence, AI.
And I'm gonna make the brass around here admit I'm right.
Bratton's analysis makes sense.
His facts are undeniable.
Henry, I'm washing my hands of the whole matter.
From now on, it's in your hands...
...and in those of the Navy Department.
I'll call the president.
A message declaring a full alert will be sent out.
Sir?
General Marshall anticipated an emergency like this.
Before he left to attend manoeuvres...
...he made out this alert order.
As you know, after the Cabinet decided to send Japan to war...
...they held an Imperial Conference at the palace.
His Majesty, who participated in this conference...
...which is a mere formality...
...was depressed and silent all through the meeting.
Today His Majesty will ask the customary questions about the war...
...and you will make the traditional replies.
There can be no more tragic ritual than this conversation...
...between His Majesty who does not want war...
...and Your Excellency, who has opposed it so vigorously.
As Minister of the Imperial Household...
...I am not allowed to attend this ritual.
Fortunately for me...
...I won't have to witness this tragic ceremony.
I can go no farther.
The Military Attaché will take you from here.
Sir, a message!
"From Admiral Yamamoto,
Commander-in-Chief, Combined Fleet...
...to Admiral Nagumo, Third Fleet...
...climb Mount Niitaka."
Hostilities will begin on December 7th...
...exactly as scheduled.
Read this back to me.
"Japanese future action unpredictable.
But hostile action possible at any moment.
If hostilities cannot be avoided...
...the United States desires that
Japan commit the first overt act."
Wait a minute. Read that again.
"If hostilities cannot be avoided, the United States desires...
...that Japan commit the first overt act.
This shouldn't be construed as restricting you...
...to a course of action jeopardizing your defense.
Prior to hostile Japanese action...
...you are directed to undertake reconnaissance...
...and other measures as you deem necessary.
These measures should be carried out...
...so as not to alarm the civil population ...
...or disclose intent. By order of General George C. Marshall."
"Not to alarm the civil population."
What do you make of it?
Well...
...if you ask me, sir, it's double talk.
But the chief of staff doesn't go in for double talk.
- We're going on alert.
- Again?
But the men are confused.
So many alerts.
- Damn it, unconfuse them.
- Yes, sir.
"Japanese forces may attack the Philippines...
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula and Borneo.
This dispatch is to be considered a war warning."
Well, there it is, gentlemen.
You now have as much information as I do.
That's the second warning in three days.
"Japanese forces may attack the Philippines...
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula and Borneo."
They don't mention us.
That's correct. I think it should be considered significant.
Well, gentlemen...
...we have a job to do.
Washington wants us to send a squadron of fighters to Midway.
And another squadron to Wake.
When can you sail?
Well, the Enterprise can sail tomorrow morning.
I'll need a day or two. We're just completing repairs on the Lexington.
Hurry things along, John.
I want you out there to probe.
I want planes up in the air morning and afternoon.
I want a report on any sign of hostile ships.
Understood.
Do you want battleships along?
Hell, no. They're too slow.
If we're gonna probe, let's probe.
We don't want anything holding us up.
You're right, but I'm not ready to commit them myself.
Not until I know when and where.
Do you plan to keep half the fleet at sea while the carriers are gone?
No, it's too risky.
I'll have to keep the fleet here at Pearl while you're away.
Get out. Get back as soon as you can.
I don't like the idea of having my battleships without air cover.
Yes, sir.
Admiral.
Kim.
Level with me.
I want a clear directive.
If I run into a Jap ship, what action do I take?
Use your common sense.
That's the best damn order I ever had.
If I see so much as a sampan there...
...I'll blow it out of the water.
"Intelligence Report,
U.S. ships now at Pearl Harbor...
...six battleships, three light cruisers...
...16 destroyers and one aircraft carrier."
No information about the other American carriers.
You know today's date?
December 1st.
Yes, but tonight will be November 30th.
When we cross the International Date Line...
...we'll push the clock ahead five hours...
...and turn the calendar back a full day, making today yesterday.
Don't be silly!
Today can't change into yesterday!
You're not too intelligent but I'll try to explain...
...so listen carefully.
It's a little before 1300 hours, right?
So why are we making supper at this hour?
1300? It should be lunchtime.
Right! And the Date Line makes up for that time difference...
...by turning today into yesterday.
I don't quite understand, but if we see the enemy across that line...
...I guess it would be useless to shoot at them.
Because how can today's shells hit yesterday's enemy?
What is it this time, getting me over here?
Tokyo has alerted their embassy to stand by...
...for a very long message in 14 parts.
Look, Rufe, you scared me and everybody else last week.
We're not doing that again, are we?
You should see this.
It's the latest report on those
Japanese troop transports.
Remember those troop ships?
They're still heading south with an escort...
...only 14 hours from the coast of Malaya.
What about their aircraft carriers?
We don't know.
Intelligence was keeping track of them until recently.
Now we've lost them.
Look, Rufe, try to put yourself in their minds.
Where do you think I have been the past week, night and day?
I am still convinced they're going to attack us.
What can we do that we aren't doing already?
I don't know about you, but I know what I'm gonna do.
Where is everybody?
Oh, it's past 12, sir.
They've already gone.
- Get them back.
- On the weekend?
Yes, on the weekend.
"Only specially screened members of your communications staff...
...are to be permitted to process the 15-part message...
...and prepare the typed translation."
It will be difficult without the help of a skilled typist.
The situation right now is extremely delicate.
We must be prepared...
...to have each part of the message decoded as soon as it comes in.
I'll alert the code room.
We'll reach Point D soon, sir.
From Point D proceed to Point E.
Battle speed.
So this is the sound of Hawaii?
Disappointing news, our main targets, the American carriers...
...have left Pearl Harbor.
This completes 13 parts?
Yes, Tokyo is holding the final part till morning.
I wonder why.
It's almost 9.
Harry, I'm going to make the rounds with what we have here.
Thank God the president's back on the list.
Have Brotherhood call me when the missing part is in.
Right.
You're late.
- Well, I was...
- Please, take me to the White House.
If you told me we were invited to the
White House, I would've dressed.
You know Mrs. Roosevelt.
She's informal personally, but a stickler for protocol...
Darling, will you shut up and drive?
Once more!
Steady.
Great! We just sank the Nevada!
Pennsylvania!
Oklahoma!
Enterprise!
No, you idiot!
It's your own flagship!
Well?
Captain Wilkinson's.
Did you see the president?
No, I saw Harry Hopkins.
And did he read the whatever it is?
No, he doesn't have the key.
I gave the pouch to our Naval aide,
Lieutenant Schulz.
He took it in to the president.
And the president has a key,
I suppose?
Of course he has.
And did Lieutenant Schulz say anything?
He said, "Thank you."
Darling, step on it, will you?
If we can see nothing, then neither can American patrol planes.
I'm more concerned about a submarine detecting us.
Dead on schedule.
Admiral Stark can't be reached.
Should I take it to chief of staff?
It's after 10, General Marshall always retires early.
I see no reason to disturb Marshall with something that's incomplete.
- Wait till you have the final part.
- Yes, sir.
If you're so concerned...
...why don't we call chief of war plans,
Admiral Turner?
His telephone doesn't answer, sir.
- You don't happen to know where he is?
- No idea.
The president has already discussed it with me.
He sent a personal message to the emperor.
But when the final part of this comes in, I'd like to see it then.
- Good night, commander.
- Good night, sir.
I was starved. I'll bet you are.
Oh, thank you, dear.
Can't you tell me anything?
Even a hint?
You'd think the world was falling apart.
Admiral Stark talked to the president.
What did the president say?
He sent a personal message to the emperor.
Gordy. Ed.
We got those B-17s coming in from California in the morning.
Honolulu radio will stay on the air all night...
...so the planes can home in.
You and I had better be in that control tower at 7:30 sharp.
- Yes, sir.
- Dear.
- Tyler, I've got a job for you.
- Sir.
Report to the new radar center at Fort Shafter at 0400.
At 4:00 in the morning?
From 4 to 7 a.m.
Our marvel of science only operates for three hours.
Lucky boy. Lucky boy!
Captain, how's it feel?
First command, first patrol.
Just fine, Mr. Young.
In fact, I think
I'll turn in for a while.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
The Commander-in-Chief has sent a message...
...wishing us good luck.
That, plus the Imperial Proclamation...
...has undoubtedly stirred your loyalty to the Empire.
The success of this mission...
...depends on surprise.
If we achieve it...
...the code words "Tora, Tora, Tora," will be sent out.
Now that the hour for battle draws near...
...I will not burden you with the usual pep talk.
Instead I shall hoist the famous "Z" flag...
...beneath which, Commander-in-Chief
Togo led his fleet to Victory...
...in the historic battle against the Russians.
Here you are.
Kramer.
AI, listen to this.
The fourteenth part.
"Will the ambassadors please submit our reply...
...to the United States government at precisely 1p.m...
...December 7th, your time."
1p.m.?
"Precisely 1p.m., your time."
I'll be right over.
Look at the president's message.
I should have had it hours ago.
As you know, communications have been delayed ...
...and frequently garbled lately.
Or deliberately interfered with.
Gene, call the foreign minister.
Tell him I want an immediate audience with the emperor.
Why is this so important?
Does this Roosevelt message say anything new?
It merely proposes a heart-to-heart exchange...
...between the two Chiefs of State.
It could start negotiations afresh.
It's too late for that.
It's just as well the message didn't come a day or two earlier.
What do I tell Ambassador Grew?
You are Foreign Minister!
Report to the palace alone with the message.
"After deciphering...
...part 14...
...destroy at once...
...your cipher machine...
...all codes...
...and secret documents."
Translate this immediately.
- Give a copy to Kramer when he comes.
- Yes, sir.
I've got to get the hell out of here.
Hey, look at this.
Finally got one.
Communication center.
It even works.
That's great.
Opana Point, communications check.
Are you reading us?
Coming in loud and clear.
Where's the General?
It's Sunday, sir.
This is Colonel Bratton.
Connect me with Chief of Staff,
General Marshall.
Yes, at his quarters, Fort Myer.
Chief of staff's quarters,
Sergeant Aguirre speaking.
Yes, Colonel Bratton.
I'm sorry, sir, the General isn't here.
Where he always is this time Sunday morning.
- Where's Colonel Bratton?
- Gone to see General Marshall.
He left this for you, sir.
Here is another part of the message, sir.
We are instructed to submit the message at 1:00 p.m. today.
One p.m.?
The 14th part of this intercept
Kramer just delivered...
...indicates to me the Japanese are going to attack.
None of us doubt that war is coming.
We know they have an expeditionary force heading south.
Sir, as hostilities seem imminent...
...I recommend you telephone
Admiral Kimmel ...
...in Hawaii.
No.
I better call the president first.
Now, if you'll all please excuse me?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
The men are in good spirits, sir.
They are eager to go.
Yes, they are eager because they do not know the taste of battle.
The mechanics asked me to give you this for good luck at Pearl Harbor.
Bring her into the wind.
"The Japanese government regrets to have to notify...
...the American government...
...that, in view of the attitude of the American government...
...it cannot but consider that it is impossible to reach...
...an agreement through further negotiations."
- Sir.
- Hm?
- There are supplemental messages.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen, I am convinced the Japanese intend to attack...
...at or shortly after 1:00 today.
- I'll alert all Pacific commands.
- Yes, sir.
Colonel Bratton, just a minute.
Take this to communications center.
We will follow that ship into Pearl Harbor.
Come in.
Captain, can you come to the bridge?
Very well.
Sub contact, Mr. Goepner?
- We're not sure.
- What ship?
The Navy tug Antares.
Look astern of her, captain.
She's towing a target raft.
Look between the ship and the raft, sir.
That, Mr. Goepner, is a submarine.
She's sneaking through the net into the harbor. General Quarters.
- Sound General Quarters.
- All engines ahead, full.
Come left 15 degrees, sir.
- Tell Antares we're attacking.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Flags, tell Antares we're attacking.
- Mount one, commence firing.
- Mount one, commence firing.
- Stand by to roll depth charges.
- Stand by to roll depth charges.
Roll one.
Roll two.
Notify Com-14 we dropped depth charges on a sub in our security zone.
Aye, aye, sir.
Captain Earle speaking.
- We have a message from the ward.
- All right, read it to me.
"Have dropped depth charges on sub operating in our security zone."
We've had so many of these false sightings, Kaminsky.
But this is the real thing, sir.
Closer than any previous sighting.
Just off the harbor entrance.
You and I know the skipper of that destroyer is a green kid.
I'll pass it to Admiral Block.
With all due respect, sir, I think we should alert all commanders.
Confirmation, Kaminsky.
I want confirmation.
The sunburst reminds me of our flag, a good omen.
Ed, this is hot.
General Marshall wants it sent to all commanders by the fastest route.
Right.
The General's handwriting, it's hard to read.
You're gonna have to help me with it, Rufe.
Hey, I'm picking up Honolulu on the radio.
Check your direction-finder dial.
It's coming from five degrees to port, sir.
Okay, keep riding that beam.
Major, I picked up some great music from Honolulu.
That's fine, pipe it through.
Okay.
Where's the damn chow truck?
Shut the thing down, George.
It's already after 7.
Hey, Joe, come here.
What do you make of that?
I've been watching it for minutes.
It's moving in, fast.
I've never seen anything that big.
- Looks like two main pulses.
- Hey, Joe, I got it.
I make that about 140 miles north, three degrees east.
Don't make sense, we got no planes out that far.
We gotta contact the information center.
Our problem is over at 7:00.
The center might make some sense out of it.
Okay, suit yourself.
Information center.
Yeah? I don't know, Mac, we're all closed down here.
Is that right? Hang on a minute.
Lieutenant, sir.
Lieutenant Tyler.
Sir, this is Private Elliot,
Opana Point.
There's a large formation of planes coming in...
...140 miles, three degrees east.
Yeah?
Well, don't worry about it.
The boys at Opana Point must have picked up the B-17s...
...coming in from the mainland.
- He said not to worry about it.
- Come on, let's go eat.
Colonel, I sent this to Manila, the canal zone and San Francisco...
...but the direct channel to Hawaii is out.
Atmospherics again?
Yes, sir, it's real bad today.
We could give it to the Navy.
What makes you think their atmospherics are better?
- Send it as a telegram.
- Yes, sir.
Our ultimatum should be delivered in
Washington before the attack begins.
I hope everything is on schedule.
Don't worry, sir.
The Emperor insists...
...that we follow the rules of the Geneva Convention.
Our declaration of war will be delivered...
...at 1:00 p.m.,
30 minutes before the attack begins.
The typing still isn't finished.
We'll have to postpone our 1:00 appointment with Secretary Hull.
Do you mean a submarine was sighted over half an hour ago...
...and that it's taken this long to report it to me?
I don't care if it still hasn't been confirmed.
I should've been informed after the ward radioed a first report.
A submarine that close is a serious matter.
A very serious matter.
Get the confirmation, all the reports to my office.
I mean, right now.
Have my driver get the car.
Aye, aye, sir. Oh, sir...
...should I tell General Short you'll miss the golf date?
No, damn it, get my car.
A message for the General at Fort Shafter.
- Is it marked urgent?
- No.
It's a little bumpy, Davey...
...but you have to fly in all kinds of weather.
Sure, Miss Fort.
Don't let the nose drop.
That's better.
You're doing just fine.
I'm taking over, Davey.
Warrant Officer Mizuki, signal all planes, "prepare to attack."
A signal from Fuchida,
"objective sighted, preparing to attack."
Everything is strangely quiet.
The American anti-aircraft batteries haven't fired a shot!
And no enemy fighters over the harbor, sir!
We've done it!
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"
Stand by.
Execute.
Get his number.
I'll report him for safety violations.
Come on!
Alert all commands:
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.
This is no drill."
General Quarters. General Quarters.
Man your stations. Man your stations.
Sir.
Battle stations. Battle stations.
Fire your gun. Fire at will.
That bastard!
Station six, man your pump.
Plane to starboard.
You bastard!
Pearl Harbor is being attacked.
- Pearl Harbor?
- Pearl Harbor is being bombed.
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.
Go back to your quarters.
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.
What in the hell is going on?
Why wasn't the Army notified?
Did anyone think to inform Washington?
I thought so.
- General.
- Put all units on a full war footing.
Alert the territorial guard.
Open a command post at Aliamanu Crater.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be right down.
Oh, my God.
The island's under attack.
Those bastards will kill us all.
Men, get to the armory.
Get guns, ammunition.
- You too, lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.
- Operator.
- Duarte Air Field.
All the phone lines are jammed.
Well, try the radio again.
Hose down that plane.
Run for it.
Run, run!
There's Hickam.
Major, I heard something funny on the Honolulu radio.
What kind of traffic control is this?
The radio said something about an attack.
They're Japs, sir.
What a way to fly into a war.
Unarmed and out of gas.
Oboe leader to Oboe flight.
We've flown into the middle of a war.
Get out fast.
Anywhere. If you can't make Hickam, try Bellows or Wheeler.
Sir, we've been hit. Nothing serious.
They shot one circuit box.
The landing light isn't working.
Better use the hand crank. Hurry.
- Major.
- Yeah.
One wheel is stuck.
Well, jolt it loose. We're going in.
- I tried.
- Try again!
Here they come. Fire!
Tell them to stop shooting at us!
We're Americans.
Major, no go, sir.
Like I said, it's a hell of a way to fly into a war.
- Run for it!
- Hurry up!
Tower to B-17, there's a Jap on your tail.
Goose your engine and get out.
Have damage control report all damages.
Sir, if we stay here we're gonna fry.
Okay, sergeant, let's get the men down.
All right, you guys, let's go.
Where the hell are our fighters?
Captain, the main fuel tanks are fractured.
Lower deck's flooded, we're listing eight degrees.
Counter flood, counter flood.
You wanted confirmation, captain?
Take a look.
There's your confirmation!
"Oklahoma, capsized.
Nevada's taken a torpedo forward and is down to a head.
West Virginia, subjected to six torpedo hits and several deck fires.
Raleigh and Helena damaged and listing."
The California, two torpedoes, fires all around, temporarily abandoned.
I've just come from her.
It's spent, sir.
Would've been merciful had it killed me.
A message from
Flight Leader Fuchida.
"Have inflicted serious damage on numerous battleships."
Better than we had dreamed!
Where are our priority targets...
...the American carriers?
Mr. Secretary.
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.
This is no drill."
No, this can't be true.
They must mean the Philippines.
No, sir. It's Pearl.
Get me the White House, the direct line.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Hull will see you in a moment. Please be seated.
Mr. President, has this been confirmed?
Then, sir,
I'd like you to have it confirmed ...
...before I receive Nomura and Kurusu.
They're waiting outside.
Operator. Operator.
Get me Haleiwa field. Fast.
George, get a hold of a car, a truck, anything.
I'm calling Haleiwa to get them to start our planes. Go.
Right!
Battleship on the left, sir!
It's the Nevada. She's making a run for the sea!
If we sink her in the channel, the harbor will be blocked for months!
Recommend course 2-3-0, sir.
- Very well. Stay at 2-3-0.
- Stay at 2-3-0, sir.
Take cover!
More hose! More hose!
- More water. More! More water.
- Abandon ship! Abandon ship!
- Abandon ship! Abandon Ship!
- Over the side!
Can't get through the outer channel in this shape.
She goes down here, she'll block the south channel.
We'll have to beach her there so she's clear.
File these.
G-5.
- I need five copies each.
Messenger.
- Take this to General Short's office.
- Right.
File these.
Corporal.
This has to be decoded for the General.
Take it to the decoding room.
Ask them to send it back soon.
Yes, sir.
Run!
Run for it!
Drop the hose and get the ladders and axes.
What are you waiting for?
- We got no water.
- Why? What's wrong?
It's the Arizona.
She cut the pipes in the mains.
The tanker in the ocean there is full of aviation fuel.
If it goes, we'll blow up half the harbor.
Come on, hurry up!
Get out of the way!
Hey, look out!
In all my 50 years of public service...
...I have never seen a document so crowded with infamous falsehoods...
...and distortions...
...on a scale so huge...
...that I never imagined until today...
...that any government on this planet...
...was capable of uttering them.
Mr. Hull.
Go.
What's the matter? Why in hell doesn't the next wave take off?
But, sir, no one has given the order.
We've knocked out the American airfields...
...sunk four battleships, heavily damaged three more.
Sir, Rear Admiral Yamaguchi's carrier has signaled!
"Attack group ready for takeoff."
Unfortunately, the American carriers were not at Pearl Harbor.
Since we don't know where they are...
...we can't use our limited supply of fuel to look for them.
We must not forget that enemy submarines will be searching for us.
We have been lucky so far.
No take-off signal yet?
There is a signal now!
It says, "All ships head for Japan as soon as our planes return."
It can't be!
It must be a mistake!
We cannot turn back now.
We must destroy the American carriers and their dry docks...
...no matter how long it takes!
You're wrong. Our mission has been completely accomplished.
This task force is vital to us.
It is my duty to return it intact.
This war is just beginning.
We have a long way to go.
Yes, all right.
This came from the decoding room, a cablegram from the War Department.
Get a copy to Admiral Kimmel.
Pardon me, admiral.
- From Washington.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen.
"The Japanese are presenting at 1p.m...
...Eastern Standard Time today...
...what amounts to an ultimatum.
Just what significance the hour set may have, we do not know...
...but be on alert accordingly."
Signed ...
...George C. Marshall, chief of staff.
My God.
This leaves the Navy with only two combat groups in the Central Pacific.
Ours and the Lexington.
We don't want to get caught like they did.
I don't intend to.
When can you be ready for sea again?
We can fuel and provision and be under way before dawn.
Good. That's good.
Here is an announcement from the
Navy Department released December 7th.
"Before daybreak today, the Imperial Navy successfully launched...
...a large-scale air raid against the American Pacific Fleet in Hawaii."
We salute the Commander-in-Chief of our Fleet...
...Admiral Yamamoto.
I had intended to deal a fatal blow to the American fleet...
...by attacking Pearl Harbor...
...immediately after Japan's official declaration of war.
But according to the American radio,
Pearl Harbor was attacked...
...55 minutes before our ultimatum...
...was delivered in Washington.
I can't imagine anything...
...that would infuriate the Americans more.
I fear all we have done...
...is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.

- IT ALL STARTED THAT
FIRST THURSDAY IN JULY.
MOM AND DAD WERE
GOING ON VACATION.
WE WERE STAYING HOME.
MOM WAS SUPER WORRIED,
BUT DAD CALMED HER DOWN.
HE SAID, "DON'T WORRY.
"THE CHILDREN WON'T
REALLY BE ALONE.
"THEIR OLD FRIEND,
PIPPI LONGSTOCKING,
"HAS PROMISED TO KEEP
AN EYE ON 'EM."
- OKAY, KIDS,
HAVE FUN AT PIPPl'S.
- YOU WOULD SAY THAT, SVEN.
NOW, I'M STARTING
TO WORRY AGAIN.
- GEE, WHAT ARE YOU
WORRYING FOR?
- THAT'S WHAT I SAY.
ANNIKA.
BYE, TOM.
- GIVE US A KISS.
- SEE YA.
- SAY HELLO TO PIPPI FOR US.
- OKAY, BYE.
- I WILL.
- SO LONG.
SEE YA!
HAVE A GOOD TIME!
- WE WILL!
BYE!
SEE YA.
- SEE YA!
- IMAGINE, LIVING AT PIPPl'S
FOR A WHOLE THREE WEEKS.
ISN'T THAT GREAT?
- GREAT!
HI, OLD MAN!
- HI, OLD MAN.
HOW ARE YOU?
WANT A PIECE OF SUGAR?
OKAY, THERE YOU ARE.
CHEW IT CAREFULLY.
HOW IS IT'?
GOOD?
SURE.
- PIPPI!
- PIPPI, WE'RE HERE!
PIPPI!
- PIPPl!
- PIPPl!
- PIPPl!
- WHERE ARE YOU, ANYWAY?
- PIPPl!
- I FOUND HER ON THE COUCH.
SOUND ASLEEP.
WAKE UP!
- PIPPI, WHERE
HAVE YOU GONE?
- WELL, YOU JUST
TRY TO FIND ME.
- SHE'S OUTSIDE
IN THE YARD.
PIPPI!
- WATCH OUT!
I'M COMING IN
FORA LANDING!
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU CAN'T FLYA BED-.
- NOBODY CAN FLY A BED-.
- IT lSN'TA BED.
THIS IS A--
MMM... lT'SAZEPPELIN.
- AW, THAT'S NO ZEPPELIN.
- SURE, IT ISAZEPPELIN.
I SHOULD KNOW.
I BUILT IT, DIDN'T I?
IA'
EXCUSE ME, MY BEARD
NEEDS A LITTLE TRIMMING.
NOW I LOOK JUST
LIKE PIRATE FABE.
- PIRATE FABE?
WHO'S THAT?
- HE WAS MY GRANDFATHER.
CAPTAIN FABIAN LONGSTOCKING.
MOST DANGEROUS PIRATE
OF THE SEVEN SEAS.
HE ONLY ROBBED
BIG SHIPS
BECAUSE THEY CARRIED
LOTS OF TREASURE.
AND ALL THE TREASURE HE
BURIED IN A SECRET CAVE,
ON A FARAWAY ISLAND,
WHERE IT REMAINS HIDDEN
TO THIS VERY DAY.
- IMAGINE, THE TREASURE
OF A PIRATE.
- THEN THAT'S WHERE
YOU AND YOUR DAD GO
TO GET THOSE GOLDEN COINS.
- UH-HUH.
GEE, THEY DONT
MAKE BEDS LIKE THEY USED TO.
PIPPI, THE PIRATE
SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD,
DOESN'T IT?
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
I'M GOING TO THE SOUTH PACIFIC.
- OH, SURE, YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN GOT A BOAT.
- WHO NEEDS A BOAT?
I'LL JUST WALK
ON THE WATER.
- WALK ON WATER!
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY.
- OKAY.
IA'
- WELL, NOW WE KNOW
YOU CAN'T WALK ON WATER.
- BUT THEN I
HAVEN'T PRACTICED.
YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE
TO DO ANYTHING WELL.
- I SEE A BOTTLE OUT THERE
WITH A NOTE INSIDE.
- HEY, YEAH.
I THINK, YOU'RE RIGHT, ANNIKA.
DON'T WORRY.
NO SECRET MESSAGE EVER GOT AWAY
FROM PIPPI LONGSTOCKING.
- IS IT REALLY
A BOTTLE MESSAGE?
- I THINK SO.
THERE'S A PAPER
INSIDE IT, ANYHOW.
- ISN'T THIS EXCITING?
- HERE, YOU TAKE IT, TOMMY.
YOU'D BETTER READ IT,
'CAUSE I STILL DON'T KNOW
ALL THE LETTERS.
- PIPPI, FROM YOUR PAPA!
- WELL, HURRY.
READ THE WORDS.
- "PIPPI, COME HELP ME
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE."
- READ THE REST, FAST!
- WELL, IT SAYS, "I'VE BEEN
CAPTURED BY PIRATES."
- OH, PAPA,
HOW COULD YOU?
- "THEY'VE TAKEN
MY SHIPAND CREW,
"AND PUT US ASHORE
ON A DESERTED ISLAND-.
"ME, I SEEM TO BE IN
A SMALL PIRATE'S TOWN.
"BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHERE EXACTLY,
"'CAUSE I WAS BROUGHT
HERE BLINDFOLDED.
"REMEMBER THOSE TWO NEW
MEN I WROTE ABOUT'?
"WELL, THEY GOT TOGETHER
WITH A BAND OF PIRATES,
"ORGANIZED A MUTINY,
"THEN BECAME PIRATE
CHIEFS THEMSELVES,
"CALLED BLOD-SVENTE
AND JOCKE THE KNIFE."
"THEY HAVE ME LOCKED UP
IN A MUSTY OLD FORT,
"AND THEY PLAGUE ME
NIGHT AND DAY
"TO TELL THEM WHERE
THE TREASURE IS.
"FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, PIPPI,
COME HELP ME BEFORE I STARVE.
"ALL THEY GIVE ME
IS BREAD AND WATER."
- BREAD AND WATER?
MY POOR PAPA.
- CHUBBY.
HEY, CHUBBY.
ARE YOU WEAKENING,
CHUBBY, EH?
- STOP CALLING ME CHUBBY.
CHUBBY.
CHUBBY, HUH?
- KEEP LAUGHING,
ROSALINDA.
SEE?
- EH?
- A MESSAGE.
NOW ALL I HAVE
TO DO IS WAIT.
- YOU JUST WAIT, CHUBBY.
YOU JUST WAIT.
- I DON'T WANNA WAIT!
I DON'T WAN NA WAIT!
I WANNA GET OUT!
- I'VE GOTTA GET UP A
RESCUE EXPEDITION, FAST.
- WE'LL GO WITH YOU, PIPPI.
- MOMMY WON'T LIKE THAT, TOMMY.
WE'D BETTER STAY HOME.
- OH, I THINKALL THREE
OF US GOING TOGETHER
ISA NEAT IDEA.
- I DON'T.
- DIDN'T I PROMISE
ON MY WORD OF HONOR
TO LOOKAFTER YOU
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE?
- WELL, YES.
- IF I LEFT YOU HOME,
I WOULDN'T BE KEEPING
MY WORD, WOULD I?
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD
HAPPEN TO THE TWO OF YOU
WHILE I WAS AWAY?
TERRIBLE THINGS, MAYBE.
- THAT'S TRUE.
- NOW, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
ON THIS EXPEDITION.
WE'RE GONNA NEED
ATELESCOPE...
A REAP'. --...
A SEXTANT...
AND THIS.
THIS IS GREAT.
- WHAT'S SO GREAT?
- FIRST, IT WAS PURCHASED
IN ACAPU LCO.
IT'S A MAGIC BALL.
NO FOOLING.
IT BELONGED TO
A FORTUNE TELLER.
CRYSTAL...
CRYSTAL BALL.
WHAT'S BECOME OF PAPA?
GOOD BALL...
FAMOUS BALL...
WHERE'S PAPA?
SHOW ME WHERE HE IS.
AW, THE STUPID THING
DOESN'T WORK.
WE'D BETTER TAKE THIS GUN.
" WOW!
- I KNOW MOM WOULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT A THING
IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE
PROTECTED WITH A GUN.
- SURE, SHE'D BE GLAD.
- IMAGINE, GOING TO
A REAL PIRATE'S TOWN.
HOW EXCITING!
- CRYSTAL BALL...
CRYSTAL BALL.
OH, IF ONLY THAT CRYSTAL BALL
WASN'T SO STUPID.
I WAS SURE IT WOULD SHOW US
WHERE MY PAPA IS.
- PORTO PILUSE.
PORTO PILUSE.
- GOODBYE, OLD MAN.
" BYE!
" BYE!
- DON'T EAT ALL
YOUR OATS AT ONCE.
SAVE SOME FOR LATER.

I BROUGHT THIS ALONG,
JUST IN CASE.

DID YOU BRING'?

WITHOUT SUCH KNOWLEDGE,
IT CAN BE DANGEROUS TO COME
TO AN UNINHABITED ISLAND.
YOU READ, TOMMY.
- "FIRST, YOU CUT DOWN
A LOT OF TREES.
"NEXT, YOU--"
- OOP!
WE DIDN'T EVEN
TAKE ALONG AN AXE.
MMM...

DOWN ALL THOSE TREES FOR US.

SAY, TOMMY,
BEAVERS HAVE TO HAVE AWFUL
TASTES IN THEIR MOUTHS.
HOW CAN THEY
STAND IT'?
I COULD NEVER
BE A BEAVER.
- ARE BEAVERS DANGEROUS?
- ANNIKA, I TOLD YOU,
THERE ARE NO DANGEROUS
ANIMALS ON THIS ISLAND.
- PIPPI!
I FOUND YOUR COMPASS!
- HEY, THAT'S GREAT!
GEE, WASN'T THAT LUCKY?
- WHAT IS IT, PIPPI?
- IT'S MY PAPA.
I DO WONDER HOW HE IS...
OUT THERE.
IA'
- WELL, CHUBBY, HAVE YOU
DECIDED TO SPEAK UP'?
- LOOSEN HIS TONGUE,
BLOD-SVENTE.
- ROSALINDA'S RIGHT.
UNLESS YOU TELL US WHERE
YOU BURIED THE TREASURE,
WE'LL HAVE TO LOOSEN UP
YOUR TONGUE A LITTLE.
- OH, BLOD-SVENTE,
ABOUT LOOSENING THAT TONGUE.
DO YOU, UH, SUPPOSE WE
COULD DO IT BEGINNING NOW,
WITH THIS?
STEEL WORKS BETTER
THAN BREAD AND WATER.
- TRUE.
- WAIT TILL PIPPI SHOWS UP.
BOTH YOU RATS
ARE THROUGH.

YOUR PIPPI IS ALL

WINDY TODAY, lSN'T IT?

PIPPI DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT WE'RE HOLDING YOU HERE.

THAT'S FLASK-POST.
I SENT HERA NOTE

PRETTY CLEVER, EH?

DON'T YOU BE AFRAID.
- HOW ARE WE EVER GONNA
GET OFF THIS ISLAND?
- GOOD QUESTION, ANNIKA.
- BEFORE, YOU SAID NO BOATS
EVER PASS THIS ISLAND.

THAT WAS SILLY.
- WHY?
- FOR ALLI KNOW,
A SHIP MIGHT BE HEADING
THIS WAY RIG HT NOW.
- SURE.

WHAT'S THAT?
TOMMY, ANNIKA,
COME OUT QUICKLY!
- WHAT'S WRONG?

IT'S COME.
THAT SHIP I MENTIONED
LAST NIGHT.
- HEY, WAIT!
THAT'S A PIRATE-SHIP!
- BUT, PIPPI, BLOIIFSUENTE
AND JOCKE THE KNIFE
MIGHT BE IN CHARGE.
- WELL, THEY'VE
SAILED IN OUR PORT!
- HEY, WATCH OUT, PIPPI!
SHARKS, SHARKS!
- THE OCEAN IS FILLED.
IT'S FILLED UP
WITH BIG SHARKS.
COME BACK!
- WHO'S AFRAID OF
SOME OLD SHARKS?
GETAWAY, YOU OLD SHARK.
I HAVE TO GET THROUGH.
THAT'S THE WAY.
THAT'S A GOOD SHARKIE.
- WELL, GOOD MORNING.
ONE-EYED OSKAR,
WHAT GETS YOU UP SO EARLY?
- WELL, LOOK, KALLE,
A MAN HAS TO SLEEP SOMETIME.
EVEN IF HE IS
AN ADVENTURER.
WELL, TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'LL SAY
AFTERWARDS ABOUT US?
- WHAT?
- THAT YOU AND ME,
KALLE THE FOX
AND ONE-EYED OSKAR,
ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS
PIRATES ON THE SEVEN SEAS.
WE'LL LAUGH AT THOSE PIGS.
THAT BLOD-SVENTE
AND JOCKE.
MOVE OVER, BOYS!
MAKE ROOM!
- AND ONCE WE GET OUR HANDS
ON THAT LONGSTOCKING GUY,
WE WON'T BE JUST THE MOST
DANGEROUS ON THE SEVEN SEAS,
WE'LL BE THE RICHEST!
SET SAIL, LADS!
TO PORTO PILUSE!
TO PORTO PILUSE!
WHAT WAS THAT?
- OH, THE WATER'S
ALIVE WITH SHARKS.
LOOK, YOU JUST
LEAVE BLOD-SVENTE
AND JOCKE THE KNIFE TO ME.
WITH MY OWN HANDS,
I'LL PUT 'EM RIGHT ON THE PLAN K,
AND THEY'RE FINISH ED.
- AND THAT LONGSTOCKING GUY
GOES RIGHT DOWN TO THE HOLD,
AND THERE HE STAYS
ON BREAD AND WATER,
TILL HE SQUEALS ABOUT WHERE
HE'S BURIED HIS TREASURE.
- QUICK, GET OUR THINGS OUT!
- WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO, PIPPI?
- WE'RE GOING TO BECOME PIRATES
AND TAKE THAT SHIP.
- HOW WILL WE BE
ABLE TO DO THAT?
- AS GRANDFATHER USED TO SAY,
WE HAVE TO BE CLEVER.
- POOR BLOD-SVENTE.
I'M GLAD I'M NOT
IN HIS SHOES.
- AND NOT IN
JOCKE'S EITHER.
COME OVER HERE.
- OSKAR!
- OSKAR!
- OSKAR!
- WHO IN THUNDER
CAN THAT BE?
- OSKAR!
- WILL YOU TELL ME
WHO KNOWS ME OUT HERE?
- DON'T ASK ME.
- OSKAR!
- COME, OSKAR!
- THE lSLAND'S UNINHABITED,
ISN'T IT?
GHOSTS, YOU THINK?
BUT WHAT COULD
THEY WANT FROM ME?
HELLO!
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME THERE?
- OSKAR!
OSKAR!
COME AND GET THE
TREASURE, OSKAR!
- PIRATE TREASURE.
- DON'T WORRY, OSKAR.
WE'LL ALL GO WITH YOU.
EVERYBODY IN THE BOATS.
- RAFAEL, YOU REMAIN ABOARD
AND KEEP A SHARP WATCH.
- HEAVE!
HEAVE, TOO,
ME HEARTIES!
HEAVE!
- OSKAR!
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET THAT TREASURE!
- OSKAR!
- I HEARD IT OVER HERE.
OVER HERE.
OVER HERE SOMEWHERE.
- OSKAR.
YOU SEE THAT?
- A MONKEY WITH CLOTHES ON.
HEY, THAT'S SCARY.
- DUMB MR. NILSSON.
YOU MAY HAVE RUINED
OUR WHOLE ESCAPE PLAN.
- HEY, YOU THINK
THE MONKEY CALLED?
- NAH.
I KNOW THEY'RE
NOT THAT SMART.
- BUT THIS ONE LIVES ON
AN UNINHABITED ISLAND,
DRESSED LIKE A PERSON.
- EH... COME!
- MR. NILSSON,
COME DOWN!
- WELL, THEY GOTTA
BE HERE SOMEPLACE!
- WHO SAYS SO?
MAYBE THEY'RE BLASTED SPOOKS,
IS WHAT THEY ARE.
- SPOOKS, MY FOOT.
THEY'RE HERE.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
IT SUDDENLY GOT SO QUIET.
WHY DON'T THEY SHOUT
OR CALL OUT,
SO WE CAN TRACE
THEIR VOICES?
- LISTEN, SOMETHING FISHY'S
GOING ON AROUND HERE.
- OOH.
- HELLO, HELLO!
BACK TO THE BOATS!
BACK TO THE BOATS, EVERYBODY!
- WHOA!
- YOU, JUMP INTO THE BOAT
BEFORE THE SHARKS GET YOU.
- HELP!
KALLE!
OSKAR!
KALLE!
OSKAR!
- OSKAR! OSKAR!
- HEY, OUR SHIP, OUR SHIP!
IA'
- PIPPI, I DO FEEL SORRY
FOR THOSE PIRATES.
HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED
TO GET OUT OF THERE?
- BUT THEY HAVE
BOATS, ANNIKA.
AND THEY ALL CAN ROW,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW.
- HEY, THAT RHYMES!
BUT ARE WE ALLOWED TO TAKE
THEIR BOAT AWAY FROM THEM
LIKE THAT?
- IT ISN'T THEIR BOAT.
THEY CAPTURED IT,
AND THEN TOOK IT RIGHTAWAY
FROM SOMEONE ELSE!
- WE'LL BORROW IT TILL WE GET
HOME TO VILLA VILLEKU ILA.
THEN THE FIRST
THING I'LL DO
IS STICK AN ADVERTISEMENT
IN THE PAPER.
"FOUND, ONE PIRATE SHIP.
"MAY BE CLAIMED BY
GIVING DESCRIPTION."
- YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
HOW FILTHY YOU CAN GET
ON THESE EXPEDITIONS, TOM.
- GOOD THING
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
- BETTER GIVE
YOUR SHIRT TO ME.
PIPPI, GIVE ME YOUR APRON.
- HERE, ANNIKA.
IA'
- HA-HA!
- THERE YOU ARE.
- AW, NO!
THERE IS THE PIRATE FABE!
DREAD MENACE OF
THE SEVEN SEAS.
HA-HA!
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT,
"HA-HA?"
- WELL, HAVEN'T YOU HEARD,
THAT'S WHAT ALL PIRATES SAY.
HA-HA!
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE PIRATE
SHIPS THAT ARE FULL OF GRUB?
L'! I ill h'! E
I'LL STAND WATCH.
GO GET SOME GRUB, MATE.
- SO, PIRATE FABE HIMSELF
WILL BE AT THE HELM.

PIPPI.
WHEN SHE DOES,
I'M GONNA LET HER HAVE IT
RIGHT IN THE KISSER.
THAT BRAT IS GETTING
ON MY NERVES.
I'M SICK AND TIRED.
I MEAN IT!
- WELL, YOU'D BETTER TRY
OUT THE CANNONS FIRST
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE
WORKING RIGHT.
- AYE-AYE, CAPTAIN.
TEST ALL CANNON.

- WHERE WE GONNA GO?
- WE'LL HIDE IN THE WELL.

WOULDN'T LIKE.
SHE GETS HYSTERICAL
EVEN IF WE GET OUR FEET
A TI NY, LITTLE BIT WET.
- I THINK SHE'S
A BIT SQUEAMISH.
- LET'S CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.
LOOK, PIPPI, HOW LONG
ARE WE GONNA STAY HERE?
- I THINK UNTIL TONIGHT,
WHEN THE PIRATES GO TO SLEEP.
- AND FIRE!
AND FIRE!
AND FIRE!
- "AND FIRE" MEANS
QUITE AN EXPLOSION.
GEE, IF I ONLY KNEW WHERE
THEY WERE HOLDING MY PAPA
AS THEIR PRISONER.
I THINK I'LL GO UP THERE
AND HAVE A LOOKAROUND.
- CAREFUL, PIPPI.
- ARE YOU WEAKENING
YET, CHUBBY?
I'M WEAKENING.
I THINK I'VE
LOST ALL COU RAGE.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
PIPPl'S EVER COMING.
I GUESS SHE NEVER
GOT MY BOTTLE NOTES.
- BRAVO, BRAVO!
- YOU ARE THE MEANEST PAPAGAYA
I'VE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE
TO MEET.
- KISS ME.
KISS ME.
- NO, I CAN'T.
I CAN'T.
MUST HANG UP THIS HANKY
TO DRY OUT.
- I KNOW WHERE
THEY'VE GOT MY PAPA.
HE'S IN THE EAST TOWER.
I SAW HIS BIG HANDKERCHIEF
HANGING OUTSIDE.
- ARE YOU POSITIVE THAT IT'S
HIS HANDKERCHIEF YOU SAW?
- SURE, I GAVE IT TO HIM MYSELF
AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT,
YOU SEE.
IA'
- WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?
- I DON'T KNOW THE WORDS.
IT'S A SCANDINAVIAN
PIRATE SONG.
GRANDFATHER FABIAN
USED TO SING IT, TOO.
- PROBABLY BRAGGING ABOUT
HOW GREAT THEY ARE.
IA'
- OH, PIPPI,
I'M SO HUNGRY.
- I AM, TOO.
- WELL, WE'LL FIX THAT.
- STEP OVER HIM.
WELL, WELL,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
- IT LOOKS LIKE-LOOKS
LIKE JOCKE THE KNIFE.
- YES, IT'S JOCKE,
ALL RIGHT.
BUT HE'S KNIFELESS.
THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE
MY PAPA'S A PRISONER.
- WE CAN'T GET
UP THERE, PIPPI.
THERE'S JUST NO WAY.
- YES, I KNOW THAT.
BUT BY FABIAN, I TELL YOU
THAT I MUST GET UP THERE.
YOU TWO WAIT HERE.
- BUT WHAT'LL WE DO
IF THE PIRATES WAKE UP?
- HIDE IN THE CANNONS.
YOU'LL FIND IT
QUITE SAFE THERE.
- COME ON.
IA'
OH, PAPA.
LOOK, HE'S BEEN CRYING.
OH, PAPA.
PAPA, CANT YOU JUST FEEL
THAT YOUR PIPPI ls HERE?
PAPA, PAPA.

EVERY HOUR, THERE ARE
GUARDS WHO SHOW UP.
HOW DID YOU

GAINED WEIGHT.

ASSISTANCE, OSKAR.
- I'LL GET YOU FOR THIS,
PIPPI LONGSTOCKING!
- CAREFUL YOU DON'T
FALL IN THERE.
- MMM, GOOD.
- I WONDER... WHAT DO YOU
THINK THEY'LL DO NOW?
- I'LL TELL YA.
BLOD-SVENTE AND JOCKE THE KNIFE
ARE GOING TO SEA,
JUST AS SOON AS THEY CAN
RAISE SAILS ON A SHIP.
AND YOU KNOW WHY?
- HMM?
- BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE'RE
SAILING STRAIGHT FOR THE ISLAND
WHERE THE TREASURES BURIED.
- MMM.
- THEY THEMSELVES KNOW WHERE
THE TREASU RE'S BURIED NOW,
AND THEY'RE BOUND TO ATTEMPT
TO BEAT US TO THE ISLAND.
- LOOK, PIPPI, YOU KNOW
HOW TICKLISH I AM.
I HAD TO TELL THEM.
I CAN'T-I CAN'T
TELL'EM ANY FIBS.
- ITS WRONG TO TELL FIBS
ANYHOW, SO THERE.
BESIDES, WE HAVE TOO
BIG'A HEAD START.
- OH?
I THINK WERE ALSO GOING TO
HAVE A HURRICANE ON OUR HANDS
ANY TIME NOW.
HOW'S IT GOING, PAPA?
- HOLD ON!
- THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.
- PRETTY SLIPPERY UP HERE.
STORM'S GETTING WORSE.
- SO I'VE NOTICED.
I'LL RELIEVE YOU
FOR AWHILE.
- AYE-AYE.

You should let those cats out once in a while.
Outside they couldn't survive.
They were bred for degeneracy.
Like a whore.
There's harder work.
- When?
- In a week.
Here is a film of Colonel Salan Zim,
President of Eritrea,
as he steps from the plane
to Paris from the Middle East
on the first leg of his tour
of the NATO countries.
Zim was met by
foreign minister, Pierre Croyez,
and minister of state, Jacques Cassente.
Russian advisors accompanied Zim
even on this mission to the West.
A strong security force surrounded
the colonel on his way toward the podium.
This is the moment - an assassin's gun
fires, causing panic on the tarmac.
As one of the special police falls,
ministers and officials run for cover.
Another shot kills Zim's bodyguard,
Emilio Rocca.
Lights used to floodlight the area
were spun round to illuminate a hangar.
From the roof, fire from an automatic rifle.
Police returning fire
run to surround the hangar,
leaving Zim and his entourage
running for cover.
Two more police died
in the ensuing battle.
While police were distracted
by the assassin,
another shot from the darkness of
the airport and Salan Zim falls dead.
Here is an action replay,
as Colonel Salan Zim of Eritrea
meets death from an unknown assassin.
French police shot and mortally wounded
the Arab whose fire had killed four men.
He carried papers identifying him
as Yusef Belabar, a student from Eritrea,
a member of the extreme left-wing
Soldiers of Revolution.
Already in Eritrea, government forces
have raided the offices of 17 left-wing...
Do you ever count the dead, Cross?
You're beautiful, Jean, but sometimes you have the bad breath of priests.
- Did you see the opposition?
- I saw him.
What's Zharkov doing on the plane?
- How many times you been out with me?
- Six, maybe seven.
You're good, Jean.
Better - you're smart, you understand.
But that still leaves you a contract button man, necessary only because the CIA doesn't do its own killing.
Washington.
- Does the boy go into your report?
- He's the headliner.
- Why did he want to kill Zim?
- Nosy, aren't you?
Good evening, madame.
Bonsoir, monsieur.
Monsieur.
Boy saw Zim as a fascist, a brutal pig, a tool of American imperialism.
He wanted a crack at him.
I bought him a ticket.
- If he had got him?
- Mademoiselle, s'il vous plait.
You'd have picked up your money with no sweat.
If Zim was America's man, why kill him?
For your education?
Zim dead at the hands of the left serves his government and mine better than Zim alive.
But it's not his death that's important.
It's who appeared to have killed him.
One more thing. The more a man tells you, the more dangerous you become.
And the more dangerous you are, the shorter the options on your future.
Your sister still work at Air France?
Is she meeting you?
- She doesn't know I'm here.
- Sarah's picking me up. You want a lift?
I thought the rules said we were strangers from here on in.
They bend.
- No, thanks. Say hello to Sarah for me.
- I will.
- He still there?
- Upstairs bedroom.
- See you fellas in the morning.
- Right.
The President Harding Suite. Some
I know like to touch both walls of a room.
They need security.
Would you believe it?
Harding used to play cards up here with his oil friends.
I was a bellboy then. I was no more than
10. People used to tip big in those days.
Thank you, sir.
Here, kitty.
- Leave the cat.
- Yes, sir.
You need anything, sir?
Action, you know?
A little black to change your luck?
You frighten a guy.
I woke up and for a moment
I thought you were still away and I'd just dreamed you were back.
You smell of me.
Remember the story of Madagascar Ho?
A little man who dreamed of Madagascar.
Never got further than the 3rd Avenue El.
We should have run in 1945.
Where?
Today's Saturday, isn't it?
Yes, all day.
Heck still go down to the cottage on weekends?
Yeah. He and Helen left Tuesday for a couple of weeks.
They asked us down.
Their boy go too?
No. He's at UCLA now. He only comes home once or twice a year.
He sees Heck as being in the enemy camp.
He's right.
- You're gonna tell him?
- I'm gonna tell him today.
- McLeod's not gonna have a good day.
- He'll handle it.
He'll feed it into his computer for the proper reaction.
Maybe we should just go, like the Arabs, and not... and not tell McLeod.
You start to run, everyone wants to know why.
Then they make up the answers to their own questions.
I thought I just saw someone in Helen's kitchen.
You did.
Us?
You know the Agency.
They like to keep an eye on things.
Mr McLeod would like to see you.
Sorry. Afraid I must insist.
With what were you going to insist,
Mr... Filchock?
We named you well.
You're a perfect Scorpio.
You have a penchant for intrigue and violence.
Don't limit your action. Read palms.
Maybe my character will improve.
Orion boasted he would kill all the animals on the earth.
So the goddesses Diana and Latona created the scorpion to slay the hunter.
You and McLeod make two nice goddesses.
Tell Diana I've got my day planned.
Cross came back.
You were to kill him in Paris.
Remember everything?
Just in case.
I remember.
I can't see him.
He's got out and run.
Oh, Jesus!
Joy.
Joy, baby. A C-note?
My mother's dead, so who do I have to kill?
You know the Lord's Prayer?
McLeod?
McLeod, McLeod.
- How bad does he want me?
- All the way.
He say why?
- Where's your partner?
- He's hurt. He's back in the car.
Got a radio in it?
You ever been in the field?
But you've seen the survival kit.
You know what this is?
It's the happy pill.
It's the "kiss the mortgage goodbye" pill.
So long, brother of mine.
You've got 30 seconds to live.
- Miami, single.
- You got nothing smaller, mister?
What's the matter?
Business slow?
New York, single.
What time does it leave?
- You're sure?
What? Are you here for laughs? I'm sure.
Taxi.
Just drive on ahead.
Thanks.
- Anne.
- Who is it?
- C'est moi.
- Jean!
Right.
Hello, Cross.
Hello, Pick.
- I need help.
- I need the dust. Close the door.
- What are you doing in Washington?
- Missing my sister.
Sure.
Tiens.
She's lecturing.
She'll be back soon. Had breakfast?
Mm-hm.
Here, give me those.
White for your sister and red for your love. Hungry?
Coffee only.
Where are you living now?
Paris.
Do you still have the same apartment?
Yes.
You bastard!
You're one hell of a letter writer. One postcard from Damascus in six months.
He brought you some flowers. The red ones are for you. Oh, hell! The coffee!
I know a place that does a good breakfast.
Hello. May I speak to Mitch, please?
There's no Mitch here.
What number are you calling?
I'm sorry. You have the wrong number.
And how long are you here for this time?
Well, I...
No, don't tell me. It's too pretty a day.
I don't want it to rain.
Hello. Hello, Cross.
No time, Sarah.
McLeod wants me dead.
I'll have to go deep,
so you won't hear from me for a while.
Stay close. Contact no one.
When the time comes, Pick'll get in touch.
I love you, Sarah.
Keep that mountain in mind.
I love you, Cross.
First of all, I'm gonna take you to the Washington monument and...
- Excuse me, sir.
- Of course.
Wait for me outside.
McLeod wants to see you, sir.
Don't give me any trouble, please.
No trouble. Just let me get my bag.
- I'll get it for you, sir. Which one?
- There.
Where the hell are you going with that bag? Give me that bag!
Good morning, sir.
 All you had to do
was keep your heads down.
Cross would have walked
into this office to file his report.
What d'you do?
You crawl halfway up his ass!
Did you think you were following
some second-hand car dealer?
Cross is the best.
Now he's running free and all I've got is one operative with a cut head, another being held by the local police as a drug-addict homosexual, and one beat-up car.
Mr McLeod, you said to check him in and keep an eye on him and...
Get out.
- How is Harris?
- Still in a state of shock.
Cross forced a harmless hay fever pill into his mouth, told him it was cyanide.
- Beautiful!
- Shall I bail the dummy out?
No, let him sweat.
I can't let this get upstairs, Fil.
If we throw this one, the chief'll come down hard. We have to get Cross.
I've got every man on it, but without FBI or locals, we're carrying a handicap.
The Bureau would love to get their hands on this.
No, no one outside the Agency.
Blanket everything.
Every exit. Operate every contact.
I'll put it nationwide.
We'll box him in.
 Flight for Toronto is 7.15,
due in 8.10.
Then the big one: Toronto-Vienna.
It leaves at 8.25
and it's a fast-track all the way.
You'll be there at 5.30 -
1.30 in the afternoon their time.
Put it in your shoe, Jack!
Can't you read the sign? Maintenance!
Too much! I made the connections as fast as I could, like you said.
There are no through bookings, nothing traceable.
In Pittsburgh your tickets will be at the
National desk, under Father Henderson.
At Chicago go to the United desk.
There you're Father Kitts.
At Toronto it's Air Canada, under the name Father Wieland.
Und your English is not so good!
Let's get moving.
- Tell me, how do you like my place?
- Very much.
I've 75 students of English literature,
I teach nine classes a week and our new term starts next week.
And I love you.
How do you like Paris?
Better watch out, Jean. You make one promise and I'll hold you to it.
- OK, Father.
- Goodbye, my son. Bless you.
Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye!
Hello.
What are we buying for each other?
I'll pay my dues.
- How much did my sister tell you?
- She said there'd be pain.
Did she talk about Algeria?
She said that you were a lieutenant in the paratroopers.
When I think of it, I'm afraid. Aren't you?
I picked you up, remember?
I only talked Anne into sharing an apartment with me so I'd have an excuse to be around.
We can't all miss, mister. OK.
Let's give it a search.
Make a move, jockey, and I'll splash you across the sheets.
It's heroin.
You son of a bitch.
Get out of bed.
- Pull it in.
- Jean!
You've two ways to walk, Scorpio.
Down that corridor that's 30 years long... or with me.
This is Washington National Airport.
The picture shows passengers boarding this afternoon's 5.15 flight,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Would you say that was Cross?
Without an element of doubt.
Some airports have a television eye service.
They keep a video tape running, which they erase the next day. I had a hunch.
And it paid.
It should have been fairly easy to trace the destination of a priest.
Normally Washington airport wouldn't have too many priests departing, but today was the last day of a conference.
More than 300 priests departed, in all directions, between 3 and 6pm,
Cross amongst them.
- Brilliant.
- I agree.
- He had to have help.
- No. Messenger boys.
The plan was Cross's.
Would you agree to that, Scorpio?
Mm-hm.
Well... our first piece of common ground.
You boys can pack it in for the night.
You were supposed to kill Cross at the Paris job.
No contract.
- You took the money.
- You left the money.
Why?
Cross had his contract in first.
I don't play games when the rules are bent.
No one bends them faster than Cross.
Never with me.
I want Cross.
And I want him burned.
You know him best.
Find him.
- You make too many mistakes.
- Like?
You confuse what you want with what I want.
Mister, you don't have too much ground to dance on.
I could drop you for the heroin or tag you for the Paris killing.
Your government would like more names.
Your second mistake, McLeod.
Cross gave me enough information on each operation we did together.
Not conclusive, but enough to make a strange reading.
You can't let me go into a public court.
What do you want?
I want inside.
Where?
Beirut.
You want Cross's job?
If you get Cross, you get his posting.
- More.
- More?
- Where's Cross?
- More.
You run it right to the edge, don't you?
- What?
- I want to know the reason.
Executive order.
You don't question a directive in the Agency, Scorpio.
I'm not in the Agency until I get Cross.
The reason?
He's a face, a double agent.
He sold to the opposition and he has a lot more to sell.
Do you know where Cross is or don't you?
I don't. But a man named Zharkov will.
Serge Zharkov.
He's Soviet intelligence in Cairo, Cross's opposite. You think he'll go to Zharkov?
Zharkov will go to him.
But not in the Middle East, in Europe.
- Europe is a big place.
- I want internal replay on Serge Zharkov.
- Who else have you got to send but me?
- Where do I send you?
Where Zharkov and Cross have met before.
A place they both know. A place where Zharkov could have a safe house.
Ready on Zharkov.
Sergei Zharkov.
Born Kiev, 1914.
Educated in Leningrad.
Doctor of philosophy and political history,
and economics.
Fought in Spain
with the Thaelman Brigade.
Arrested in Moscow, 1939,
and sentenced to six years hard labour.
Rehabilitated in 1943.
Assignment, Balkans.
Little information
until his posting to Iraq in 1952.
Speaks fluent German, Arabic,
French, English, Hebrew.
Associated operatives: Karlin,
Ludmann,
Zemetkin...
Replay operatives.
Associated operatives: Karlin,
Ludmann,
Zemetkin...
Hold on Zemetkin.
Listen, when I came over, you promised me asylum.
- We also promised you questions.
- Yes.
And I answered all your questions.
Why am I in the airport?
You're going back to Moscow, Zemetkin.
You gave us no more than we knew.
You were cute and well-conditioned.
And all that stuff about freedom had brass edges.
You ran because you were playing pat-a-cake with state funds.
OK, we let it ride. But now we want a little interest on our investment.
Zharkov.
When Zharkov isn't in the Middle East and he isn't at home, where is he?
Maybe a former picnic ground not too east and not too west.
Somewhere the barriers are down.
I don't know such a place.
I would tell you if I knew.
Your plane.
Aeroflot flight 379, direct to Moscow.
At the other end you'll be well and truly met.
- 6481 to Ilyushin 009. Over.
- You're murdering me.

How about Vienna?
- Vienna?
- I'm sorry.
What about the police?
A mistake. The man who had the room before me forgot to pack everything.
Some mistake.
How long will you be away?
Can I come?
Impossible. Anyway, you have to teach.
- Is it going to be dangerous, Jean?
- No. Why should it be?
We've already contacted our people in Vienna.
You'll be given every facility, total cooperation.
And you can draw expenses.
McLeod's depending on you, Scorpio.
- Spain was a long time ago.
- The best died there.
There's a house on the Kurrentgasse, on the corner. Go there.
- Where are we going?
- Get in.
- You don't talk very much.
- I have nothing to say.
I see you still have a flair for the theatre, Zharkov.
It adds colour.
These drivers - your people?
Not official. Old comrades.
I hear you are running, Cross.
- What else do you hear?
- McLeod's ordered the wet stuff.
There's a gun out for you.
When did you know?
- A week before you did.
- Who have you got in your pocket?
Actually, I buy from a Bulgarian who works for the Chinese.
- Your place?
- Yours, if you need it.
No one knows about it - not my company, not your company.
Just friends, a few and trustworthy.
- And the rent?
- Take it on trust.
Thank you.
There will come a time, when those who sit above me will want you delivered.
They'll give me so much play in the rope and then they'll pull it in.
And then?
Moscow is nice in the spring.
There's a long winter, I hear.
How are you going to get your wife out?
I'll get her out.
Come over. They'll get her out for you.
No, Sergei. No Moscow.
I want out, not just a change of sides.
Sit down, Cross.
The offer of the hide still goes.
And when the rope begins to wind in?
I'll tell you.
- And you'll know where to find me.
- In Vienna I could find you anywhere.
Have you noticed, Cross, that we are being replaced by young men with bright stupid faces, a sense of fashion, and a dedication to nothing more than efficiency?
Keepers of machines, pushers of buttons, hardware men with highly complex toys, and, except for language, not an iota of difference between the American model and the Soviet model.
To dinosaurs.
Maybe you can kill Cross alone, though I wouldn't bet on it, but you're not gonna find him alone, not out there.
- Am I wasting my breath?
- No, I was listening.
And so far you've said nothing that lit any candles in the dark.
You have no proof that Cross and Zharkov are in Vienna.
You have no one on your staff that knows Zharkov.
But you did check customs, and eight priests arrived in the last three days, two from North America, Mitchell.
It is Mitchell, isn't it?
Well, Mitchell... which of the two was Cross?
The one on TWA from New York or the one on Air Canada from Toronto?
No way of telling.
Father Wieland was Cross,
Air Canada from Toronto.
I know horse players that play hunches and hot flushes.
Horse players die broke.
If Cross had flown from Washington to New York, he would have caught the Pan Am flight, but there was no priest on that flight.
He wouldn't have waited seven hours for a TWA flight.
Never stand still when you run and never run in a straight line.
That's the first thing Cross taught me.
Cross is an organiser. He plans down to the finest margin of error.
You can't follow his mistakes, so you follow his skill.
Washington to Pittsburgh or Cleveland.
Two possibles.
Cleveland or Pittsburgh to Chicago.
Chicago to Toronto.
Toronto to Vienna.
Not more than 20 minutes in any one place and less than 12 hours in all.
Wieland fits.
All the majesty of Europe.
Have you ever been to the Hermitage?
Paintings there that seize your breath.
- Stop being a guide. What have you got?
- Arrivals.
- Then they know you are here. I guessed.
- You never guess.
A defector, Zemetkin, a petty thief -
McLeod had his thumbs on him.
- He knew about Vienna.
- And the hide?
Only those I trust know that.
I could have this one killed.
No.
I would offer you coffee, Cross... but the sugar would attract too many flies.
Everyone Cross used to know in Vienna.
Everyone Cross used to know... that you know.
We're monitoring telephone calls to
America, telegrams and radio telegrams.
I want the tapes brought here.
We've got a watch on the embassies, but if Cross doesn't move, he'll be invisible.
He'll move. He'll try to get his wife out.
He'll need funds and help.
Not if he goes over.
- He won't.
- McLeod thinks he might.
If he was going over, he'd be in Moscow, not Vienna.
The trouble with McLeod is that he thinks like McLeod.
You know what a dybbuk is, Mitchell?
Some sort of Jewish sprite or ghost.
A spirit that invades another human form.
I'm the dybbuk of Cross's labyrinth mind.
I live inside him.
He'll move.
He's in here.
I've assigned Novins and Dor to help you.
They're both Viennese, both good men.
Grüß Gott.
As far as the embassy is concerned, you don't exist, so don't call for help.
Cross.
- You have some time, Max?
- Until three. But longer if you want.
- You hungry?
- I can hold out if we hurry.
Come on!
It's June.
Strauss and Strauss and Strauss.
A little Mozart, a little Brahms, then Strauss and Strauss and Strauss.
Vienna is the only city that puts on yesterday's clothes for visitors.
Cross, it's been months since I played any Webern or Berg.
And three years since I saw you, Cross.
- I'm in trouble, Max.
- Can I help?
Maybe you should first ask what.
It would only depress me or maybe frighten me, Cross.
I need a messenger boy, Max.
Waiter!
- Yes?
- Zwei beer.
Ja.
Between rehearsals or should I go sick?
You'll have plenty of time between.
Could you do the bank today?
- The old bank?
- There's a teller there called Karoldy.
He'll give you a key to a safety deposit box. In the box are three packages.
- Bring them to me.
- OK.
- What are you doing this weekend?
- I am off Friday till Monday.
- Would you like to see Rome?
- Rome?
I want someone to meet Sarah, someone she knows.
If I can clear her in the next few days, will you do it? I need it bad, Max.
Do I take her to Maria's?
Danke schön.
Nothing.
He says he hasn't seen Cross for 20 years.
Didn't even know he was still alive.
You believe him?
Yeah, I'd say so.
Put a marker on him?
Try Stross next.
72, Porkornygasse.
- We'll finish the others tomorrow.
- You'll be here?
I'll be here.
- How did you get this?
- A man asked for it to be given to you.
- Man about 50, big, American?
- Yes, but he was German.
Oh, yeah.
You should have done it in Paris, Jean.
The price wasn't right.
And now it is?
Yes, now it is.
I could kill you, Jean.
Take it, then, Cross.
It won't come around again.
Can we talk?
Sure.
McLeod name my sin?
- He said you sold and had more to sell.
- And you believe that?
Is it true? I want to know.
For your education?
No, it isn't true.
Zharkov.
- What about Zharkov?
- He is the opposition.
I've known Zharkov for almost 30 years.
As an ally, as an enemy and always as a friend.
We're both premature antifascists, as they used to say in Washington.
But Zharkov hasn't sold out and neither have I.
- Then why does McLeod want you dead?
- Why don't you ask him that?
I'm asking you.
You're looking for God's shining face, aren't you, Jean? Something to believe in.
Like a young girl in a white Communion dress.
But you've got the soul of a torturer, so your need is greater.
You lied to me, Cross, and you used me.
For that I'm going to kill you.
I never lied to you, Jean.
I used you, but I never lied to you.
Not my doing, Cross, I swear.
Don't trust McLeod. He ordered you dropped twice - Damascus and Marseilles.
That's why I gave you so much information - something to bargain with.
You owe me, Jean.
- Where?
- He's up there.
You had him last night and you let him go.
That's how it looks in my report unless you've got something to change it.
Dor says you didn't even try to get a shot off.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Never put your hands on me.
Cross, I'm off until Tuesday.
I want you to call Washington for me.
The number and the message is in that envelope.
Repeat the message exactly as it's written.
Call from a phone box.
You still don't have any questions?
What answers could you have that would make any difference?
I love you, Cross.
And I you, Max. That's why I must tell you there could be pain in this.
I have been inoculated.
You know, Cross, I used to think that the only music I would ever hear, no matter what I was really playing, was the music we played each morning when the others went out to work.
Or the music for the selection, when the lucky ones went into the showers.
Now I can hear Brahms... and not crying.
But one image has never blurred.
Cross, you coming through that gate and taking me home.
Oh, for...
- Das war sehr gut.
- Das hat geschmeckt.
Danke.
They're pulling in the net. Both sides.
They want you delivered, Cross.
I can't go back. You know that.
Not after this kind of a move.
- Not even if the Soviets took the leash off.
- But your wife...
I'll have her out in two days.
Do you know why McLeod hates you?
You are one of Donovan's adventurers, the last of the Knights Templar.
You don't stand up straight. You have your hands in your pockets, show no respect.
And tonight you are going to get drunk with a Russian.
And we are going to get drunk, Cross.
What was it you used to say?
Falling down drunk.
Falling down drunk.
And then we'll get maudlin.
We will sing, I will cry, and then
I will tell you some very funny stories.
 Tell Mother to take the books
back to the library. They are overdue.
Give her my love
and tell her not to carry things.
Just a man calling his mother, Mitchell?
Only two things don't wash, Mitchell.
He called a public phone in Washington and he doesn't have a mother.
His whole family died in the camps.
You didn't crosscheck each one, Mitchell, and you cost me a day.
You are so damn quick to write notes to McLeod. Put that in, Mitchell.
I traced it back to a Max Lang.
He used a phone booth in a café near the state opera house.
You knew that, Mitchell, but you didn't go there.
- Dead end.
- It could have been a dead end.
But Lang needed more change.
He asked one of the waiters.
The waiter knows him.
He is a cellist, Mitchell.
And, even more important, he was in the Resistance when Cross was liaison.
The whole goddamn thing's redundant.
There are no more secrets.
At least, none worth stealing.
It's a lower form of life.
Its reason of existence is its reason to exist.
What the hell are you doing?
Jesus, Sergei.
You even hide things from yourself.
Tell me, what keeps you from burning out?
You see before you the last of a race of giants.
No, no, no.
I mean seriously.
Seriously?
I still believe.
I'm still a communist.
Communist? For Christ's sakes!
After what you've seen?
You've seen it turn brutal... inhuman.
No, Cross. I've seen men use it badly.
What about the trials? The purges?
Trials, purges - they are words you have read somewhere, Cross.
My trial was so grotesque, my hours of interrogation so terrible that I was numb.
It was a kind of frontal lobotomy without anaesthetic.
And the labour camps - where men, good communists, old fighters, men who believed in the dignity of man above all else, were used as draught animals to pull logs on frozen feet.
That this could be the result of all I had committed my life to.
But, baby, at that moment, didn't you realise what was happening?
At that moment I tried to understand what had happened to me.
Most of us there were communists, not Stalinists. That is why we were there.
Nothing had happened to make me renounce myself.
I was still a communist.
Stalin couldn't take it away from me.
And now the dull, grey stupidity that sends the tanks into Prague because it has no imagination - it can't take it from me either.
I am still a communist.
You're still an idiot.
You still serve that dull, grey stupidity.
And when they pull the wire on me,
I'll deliver you to them, Cross.
Yesterday at 16.20,
Sarah Cross received a local phone call, the same message as the one monitored in Vienna to someone here in Washington.
We have no trace on that someone.
She left the house at 17.05.
Notice the handbag.
It's big enough to carry a package - say, the size of a book - without it showing.
She went to this storage house.
Cross kept some Middle Eastern furniture and artefacts there from the time he sent his wife home from Cairo.
She signed in, got the keys and went upstairs. She was inside six minutes.
She told the inventory clerk she had to measure a cabinet.
She signed nothing out. She left and drove to the Library of Congress building.
We got no film inside that building, but one of our operatives followed her.
The place was crowded with tourists and it was nearly closing time.
Now, she spoke to no one... deposited nothing, simply wandered through the exhibit halls.
However, on her way out she had to pass through a group on a conducted tour.
No way to check persons on tour.
She exited the building at 17.49.
- Could be a drop.
- But did she make her connection?
Probably someone in that group.
Or she could have picked something up.
Passport, ticket, escape details.
She's due to run.
I want her place searched.
Get Heck Thomas - he lives behind her - to invite her for drinks, dinner, anything.
Then get a contract thief to get one of our men in there.
Brief him on what he might be expected to find.
Make it look like a routine housebreaking.
The thiefs gotta leave prints.
We'll give him shelter.
Nothing. He had this in his pocket, though.
The phone message.
Cross's handwriting.
I'll talk to Lang.
He's dead.
He wouldn't talk.
The car! Box him in!
You stay up here.
Cross!
I'm tired, Helen, and I've been very bad company, so thank you and say good night to Heck for me.
- Come over for coffee in the morning.
- OK.
- I know about music...
- We're out of booze again.
- There's a couple more in the kitchen.
- No, that's gone too.
Uh, where'd Sarah get to?
She's gone home. She's got the dumps.
- Jesus, no!
- Heck!
She's gone back to her house.
Should I go after her?
No, don't get involved.
Call him. Warn him.
I'm going over there.
Jesus Christ!
What happened in there?
Now.
More of your litter, Mr Mitchell.
Always with access to my superiors.
I don't like your type in my streets.
I've lost another man and that bastard thinks it's funny.
You've lost more than another man, Mitchell.
You've lost Zharkov.
That means we've lost Cross.
It might just be that Cross would be more valuable, more cooperative, if we helped him without conditions.
We don't think so.
Alex, you don't think.
You take orders.
And so do you, Zharkov.
Your orders are the same as mine - put
Cross on tomorrow's flight to Moscow.
Your intimacy with this man could be interpreted...
Alex, you remind me of someone I used to know.
- Who?
- Funny, he never told me his name.
Like you, he was building his career on a passionate belief in obedience.
He took his revolution from books, his Marxism from easy-to-swallow, predigested pap.
He was building socialism in one country with the bones from a charnel house.
There were a lot of them around in 1939.
I can't give you any more time, Cross.
- Two days.
- My head on a tray.
Malkin?
Another keen son of a bitch.
Better get dressed.
You know, Sergei...
I might be better than you in a closed room.
Don't even think about it.
For you.
Do me one favour, Cross.
Run, as fast and as far as you can.
You've nothing but enemies now.
Both sides.
Don't catalogue the excuses through the alphabet. You got it cleaned up?
Morrison's in the hospital, with our own medical people. It's a bad wound.
- The thief?
- He ran. Untraceable so far.
- No one's untraceable.
- Damp down the police search.
- We don't have the means.
- Over their heads, we do.
If Milne's found dead, that'll make for more questions and deeper probes.
All right. All right, but get Morrison out of Washington. Fly him to Panama.
It is a bad wound.
I won't cry if the goof dies.
Change your mind, my friend?
I've bad news, Cross.
Our sister Sarah has gone to her rest in the peace of Christ.
With faith and hope of eternal life, let us commend Sarah to the loving mercy of our Father.
The hunter home from the hill.
I'd buy a plot here soon, Mr McLeod.
It's a nice cemetery.
You think I'm responsible for this?
- Cross will.
- And you think he'll come back?
Don't you?
We have evidence that he's in Moscow.
Then burn incense in front of it,
McLeod. And pray.
From our end, the contract is still open.
Why the Bahnhof?
All faces are anonymous in railway stations.
You're sure there will be no trouble?
He's there, packed and ready to make the trip.
The negatives and prints are on their way to Moscow.
There is a limited interpretation possible, but an accompanying report clarifies the more shadowed areas.
And you are seeing Cross off.
You might try denial, but it is a weak plea, and at best would leave you open to charges of incompetence.
I suggest you defect.
Cross, Zharkov getting off a Soviet Ilyushin aircraft.
This photo's reported to have been taken from the roof of the Moscow airport.
Lab says could be but no hard evidence.
Cross here shaking hands with three VIPS. Zharkov in the background.
That indicates the three are high-ranking.
No telling who these two are, but this one in profile could be Stolypin, head of the Arab section in Moscow.
Notice this maintenance vehicle.
The lab blew it up and it definitely has the markings and plate numbers of Moscow.
That's the first hard evidence.
All the rest are blow-ups to examine everything in detail.
We've combed it out tight, the results say it probably is Moscow.
But could be Prague or Budapest.
OK, Tom.
- Where's Zharkov now?
- Cairo.
Flew directly there from Moscow.
The opposition is chortling about some coup.
Cross has gone over.
Scorpio still expects him.
The Frenchman's a loser.
You could have had that beautiful Abyssinian in the pet shop.
I like street cats.
I'm going to call you Sun Tzu.
Who on earth is Sun Tzu?
- A great scholar of war. Wasn't he, cat?
- I bet he has fleas.
It's a sign of his independence.
I wanted to buy you something lovely and exotic.
You wanted to buy me something
I wanted. All right, I'll take this one.
OK. There's no charge. If you want to give something, there's a donation box.
OK.
Should we give him anything special to eat?
You can use anything.
If he's hungry, he'll eat anything.
Just a word, Mr Laurier.
A few minutes, please.
McLeod has closed the Cross file.
Is that a polite warning?
No. I'm here on my own.
- I'd like your opinion.
- You know my opinion.
That airport, could be Moscow.
- Could be?
- We think it is.
But could be Prague or Budapest.
That's careless geography.
You... you still think
Cross will come back?
If that was Moscow, they'd hardly let him pose for photographs and then leave.
I don't know where it is and I don't know what the Russians might or might not do.
But I know what Cross will do.
What do you think I should do?
Sit in McLeod's chair and see if it fits.
It will be vacant soon.
We've got a fix on the thief. His name's
Paul Milne. He's running scared.
I'd hit him tonight.
He might be gone by tomorrow.
He's a third-term man - so he's down for life without a killing on his sheets.
The law should be breathing hard down his back, but there's no heat.
The story is that the man downtown has been told to cool it and doesn't like it.
The grumble goes high up.
You think they could put a fix in?
They might if they had a good reason.
What's this Milne's form like?
Housebreaker, jimmy and soft-shoe stuff.
Never been caught with a gun or a blade.
I've asked around, but nobody says he shot your wife.
But you know where to find him.
What the hell is this?
Who are you guys?
No! Jesus, that's gas!
Who are you?
Match.
Holy mother of God!
- The job where the woman was killed.
- I didn't kill her! I don't carry a gun.
Who?
I was hired. This guy.
I don't even know his name.
- Did he tell you what to look for?
- Notebook, a small package.
Paper, letters, anything with writing on it.
- Did he shoot her?
- Yes.
The lady comes in sudden and she's got this gun.
She opened up on him and he blasted her.
Cross.
Give up smoking, thief.
It's bad for your health.
- So now you know.
- Now I know.
How are you gonna get that guy if he's as big as you say he is?
- Miff Wilson.
- Cross, man, it's gonna cost you.
I can afford it. I've saved enough to buy a mountain I won't need any more.
I know you're out there, Cross.
I can feel it.
- Miff.
- Cross.
- How are you?
- Great.
- Got a minute? Let's step outside.
- Sure.
Miff, remember the job you did for me in Michigan?
I want you to take care of someone for me. He'll be in a black Cadillac car.
Hey, nut.
What are you doing?
They're beautiful.
- We're going to Paris.
- When?
Tomorrow. We'll get an apartment.
- You've got an apartment.
- A new one.
You're crazy. You know that?
Crazy out of your skull.
No.
I love you.
If anything happens to me, if I'm stopped at the airport or anything like that, take this to the French embassy, to a Gil Mousseau.
Gil Mousseau.
And give it to him.
He'll know what to do.
No, don't ask now.
I'll tell you soon. In Paris.
Are you in trouble, Jean?
No. That's my insurance policy.
You know I'm old-fashioned enough to buy you a ring.
And I know a place that makes a good breakfast.
- See you on Monday, Fil.
- Have a good lunch.
Bloody martini circuit.
Damn town runs on olives and small talk.
- This is it.
- Is this the place?
- This'll be OK.
- Right on.
You drive on.
Stay here, Mr McLeod. I'll see to it.
- Don't move me.
- Call an ambulance.
Don't move me.
Mr McLeod, sir.
Quick, quick!
Get an ambulance.
Your flight leaves Dulles airport at 7.50.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
- I will see you over there.
- Yeah.
Mr Laurier.
You were right, Scorpio.
We should have listened to you.
Are you going to fulfil your contract now?
I'm out.
We still want Cross.
He'll make contact now with the opposition, one last big delivery.
You've shown me no proof that Cross was a traitor.
You've got a handful of maybes.
You can't buy 10 minutes of my time with that.
Proof? You want proof?
What do you think McLeod was?
A psychopath?
Some sick mind that went about ordering killings to make his days interesting?
No. He was a professional, like Cross, but with a difference.
He was honest. He had only two gods:
Efficiency and duty.
Cross is a double agent.
In intelligence all evidence is, of necessity, circumstantial, but Cross had bank accounts with considerable assets in Zurich, under the number 30-98-71.
You can see it written down there in his handwriting, checked out against a signature on his American Express credit card.
In that account alone he had $238,000, down this year to $124,000.
By the way, Scorpio, you can hold the picture on screen or close in on it by using that panel in front of you.
His next account turned up in Panama, this time under the name
Robert Crosthwaite.
Credit: $19,500.
He also has a Dallas bank account under the name Gerald Cross.
Assets, as of January '73, $60,000.
I grant you, field work demands trading with the opposition.
Cross knew men like Zharkov but...
Here he is with Raymond Hussein in Paris, a man who he told us he had never met.
With Robert Simmonds in Beirut, another name that never appears in his reports.
Cross again in an Arab guerilla camp with Salem Demoum.
They received substantial information leaks from unidentified sources, leaks that could have come from Cross.
So when his wife returned to Washington, we put her under surveillance.
We have reason to believe that she was being used as a delivery.
This was filmed by one of our agents when she left the house shortly after the message you monitored was called through to Washington.
She went to this storage house.
Cross kept some belongings there.
Then she went directly to the Library of Congress building, we believe to pass a message.
It was very crowded there with tourists.
She may have made a drop.
Our agent couldn't be sure because he wasn't allowed to photograph.
She left there at 5.49, just before closing time.
I picked you up, remember? I only talked
Anne into sharing an apartment with me
so I had an excuse to be around.
 I picked you up, remember?
Good night. Bye-bye.
Jean.
Jean.
You'll have to look me in the eye when you kill me, Jean.
That won't bother me. Not this time.
No, you're a one-talent man, Frenchman.
You took this contract cos you wanted inside, you wanted my job, and you needed a McLeod to carry your sins for you.
I was finished with you, Cross.
I was going home tomorrow... with her.
- She was my way out.
- I'm sorry about the girl. Truly sorry.
But I had no part of her plans.
She was a Czech courier and very good.
A lot of hard work went into collecting this.
Go ahead, Scorpio.
It should be easy.
You'd be doing both of us a favour, and there's an outside chance they might let you live.
Two for one.
There's a room just down the hall from McLeod's office... where grown men play a game.
It's a bit like Monopoly, only more people get hurt.
There's no good... and no bad.
Jesus.
The object is not to win... but not to lose, and the only rule is to stay in the game.
Visiontext Subtitles: Sally Lewis
In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
Many ages ago, when this ancient planet was not quite so ancient...
...long before man recorded his history...
...there was the time of Middle Earth when man shared his days...
...with elves, dwarves, wizards, goblins, dragons and hobbits.
In the lands of Middle Earth, in an area known as the Shire...
...there was a village named Hobbiton.
There, in a hole in the ground, lived a hobbit.
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole...
...nor a dry, bare, sandy hole.
It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort.
Bilbo Baggins?
- I'm looking to hire a burglar.
- Burglar?
You've come to the wrong place.
You mean you do not wish to share a grand adventure?
Dear me, no.
We hobbits are plain, quiet folk.
Adventures make one late for dinner.
Enough! I am Gandalf.
And Gandalf means me!
- Gandalf? Not the wandering wizard?
- The same!
Listen.
Thorin and company, at your service.
Dwalin, Balin...
...lKili, Fili...
...Dori, Nori and Ori.
Oin, sir. And Gloin, sir.
Call him Bifur. And him Bofur.
And Bombur at your service.
We are all at your service.
What do these dwarves want in Hobbiton?
They have come for tea, and for supper...
...and for you, Burglar Baggins!
- There's a magic in that music.
- And it moves through me.
- You feel the love of beautiful things.
- To go and see the great mountains...
...and hear the pine trees and waterfalls.
To wear a sword instead of a walking stick.
Just once.
Gandalf, dwarves, and Burglar Baggins...
What is this "burglar" business?
If you prefer, you can say
"expert treasure hunter."
Well, yes, I do prefer that.
We are met tonight in the house of our friend...
...this most excellent hobbit.
May the hair on his toes never fall out.
Hear, hear!
We shall soon start on our long journey.
Our object is, I take it, well-known to us?
All of us?
It is not well-known to me.
Really? Then we must inform our burglar.
We seek a treasure...
...that which is rightfully ours.
Far off in the East...
...beyond the Misty Mountains and the dark Forest of Mirkwood...
...there you will find
Lonely Mountain.
Long ago, this was the home of my people...
...and was ruled by my grandfather:
King Under the Mountain.
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep
Where dark things sleep
In hollow halls beneath the fells
Goblets they carved there for themselves
And harps of gold where no man delves
There lay they long
And many a song
Was sung unheard by man or elves
For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought
And light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword
On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars
On crowns they hung
The dragon fire
In twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun
Undoubtedly, all this wealth was what brought the dragon.
The pines were roaring on the height
The winds were moaning in the night
The fire was red
It flaming spread
The trees like torches
Blazed with light
And below us, in the valley, lay Dale...
...a town of mortal men.
The bells were ringing in the Dale
The men looked up with faces pale
The dragon's ire
More fierce than fire
Laid low their towers
And houses frail
The mountain smoked beneath the moon
The dwarves they heard
The tramp of doom
They fled their hall
To dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon
Curses to the dragon!
Curses to Smaug!
He killed our men and stole our gold!
Curses to the dragon Smaug!
Is this the adventure you've planned for me?
To help you recapture the gold?
None other.
There are 13 of you. Very unlucky.
Mr. Baggins will make it 14.
A splendid lucky number you've found for us.
No arguments.
Let us have the contract.
"To Burglar Baggins:
Terms for your professional services.
One fourteenth of total profits.
Traveling expenses guaranteed.
Funeral expenses, if necessary.
Sincerely, Thorin and Company."
- "Funeral expenses"?
- Do you find the terms acceptable?
- Of course he does!
- But, but, but l...
And so tomorrow begins your greatest adventure.
No hat, no stick, no pipe.
Not even a pocket handkerchief.
How can one survive?
- How did Gandalf get ahead of us?
- He comes and goes at will.
He is a wizard, you know.
Oh, bother burgling and everything to do with it.
Always remember, Bilbo, when your heart wants lifting...
...think of pleasant things.
Eggs and bacon. A good, full pipe.
My garden at twilight. Cakes...
We'll camp here. Perhaps we can find a dry patch to sleep on.
Our lookout has spied something.
Look. Trolls!
Miserable, no-good, robbing trolls!
Where the deuce is Gandalf?
Left us again. Just when a wizard would have been most useful.
No matter. We have an expert burglar with us.
- What have trolls to do with burgling?
- We could use some of their meat.
- Oh, I say!
- Burglar, do your burgling!
Blast! Nothing but mutton to eat!
How I long...
...for a bit of man-flesh!
Bacon and eggs. My fireplace.
Hot chestnuts.
- What the blazes?!
- Help! Let me down! Stop that!
What have we got here?
Let's cook him and find out!
He wouldn't make a mouthful.
But maybe there's more where he came from.
Dwarves! I'm done for! Run for it!
Dwarves?
Now that's a supper.
Let's go get them all!
Let us roast them.
Boil them, says I!
Each to his own, boys!
There's plenty for all.
I likes mine raw.
Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!
The sun!
Blast it!
How did the morning come so soon?
We're done for!
Excellent.
One moment. One moment!
Where's that bumbling Burglar?
Lucky number, indeed!
Over here!
Come see what I've found.
Not bad, Burglar, for your first attempt.
Oh, it was nothing, actually.
We'll keep these.
Deucedly fine blades.
Considering they were made by trolls.
They don't seem like troll blades to me.
Probably stolen.
- See these strange runes?
- Whatever are runes?
Ancient writing. Mine has them too.
Can you make them out?
I am not familiar with these letters.
Well, whoever made them, we've got them now!
Cover up the treasure, men.
We'll fetch it on our return.
Take that, Smaug, you filthy worm!
I see you've also claimed a sword.
Yes. Just a dagger, actually.
But for one of my size, it suffices.
Hurry, men, we must be on our way.
- Hold!
- Hold?
It is time for you to have this.
And what may that be?
This is a map of Lonely Mountain...
...presented to me 100 years ago by your father.
What? Why did it not come to me, the rightful heir?
I've chosen my own time to hand it over.
Oh, I do love maps.
I have quite a collection.
I remember the mountain well enough without this!
Indeed? And how do you intend to enter Smaug's chambers?
Through the main gate, as a houseguest?
You'd be ashes before you took your seventh step.
Oh, see, look!
This hand points from these runes to...
Bless my soul! A secret entrance!
- A hidden passage to the lower halls.
- Excellent, Burglar!
- I'm really quite good with maps.
- Let me see.
Yes, quite correct.
But has it remained a secret all these years?
It's too small for Smaug to use.
It's covered by a door made to look exactly like the side of the mountain.
Here is the key. IKeep it safe.
Of course I will!
But if the secret door is hidden, how do we find it?
- The map doesn't tell.
- It does and it doesn't.
You will understand in time.
Behold, at last, Rivendell!
The hidden valley of the elves, where Elrond dwells.
Simply enchanting!
- But we must be on.
- Pity.
Elvish singing is not a thing to miss...
...in June, under the stars. But...
My dear Elrond, your hospitality is magnificent:
The food, the wine, the stories, the music.
Yes, but we've much to accomplish.
You promised to have a look-see at these troll swords.
Yes, yes, of course.
Well, first of all, they're not troll-make.
They must have been stolen.
They were made for the Goblin Wars.
This sword, Thorin, the runes name:
Orcrist, the Goblin Cleaver!
- And mine?
- Glamdring, the Foe Hammer.
- IKeep them well.
- I will keep this in honor.
- Now show me your map.
- I have it here.
Something strange. Let's see.
Yes, indeed!
There are moon letters here! See?
What are moon letters?
Runes that can only be seen when the moon shines behind them.
They give directions for finding the secret door.
"Stand by the gray stone when the thrush knocks...
...and the last light of the setting sun...
...will shine upon the keyhole."
This way!
Shelter! A dry cave!
Now get some sleep, men.
We've found the perfect place to camp.
Dwarves have a strange notion of perfection.
And where's Gandalf?
Gone again? I wish I was a wizard!
Hello! What's this?
Look out!
The ponies! The ponies!
Wake up! We're being robbed!
The goblins are upon us!
Save the ponies from the goblins!
Trapped! The goblins have us!
Who are these miserable persons?
Thorin at your service.
We did not mean to trespass.
We were merely seeking shelter from the storm.
He is a liar,
O truly tremendous one.
Ask him to explain his weapon!
This sword is named
Orcrist, the Goblin Cleaver!
Murderers!
Elf friends!
Stop!
I know that sword!
It is called
Glamdring, the Foe Hammer!
It's Gandalf! Good old Gandalf!
Follow me! Quickly!
Through here! Follow me!
Bilbo!
He's gone!
Where are you?
My precious.
It is my precious.
Hello, my precious.
Bless us and splash us.
Food for my precious.
Eggs and bacon. Spoons all polished.
Warm muffins and sweet butter.
What is that noise, my precious?
My precious does not know.
Bless my soul!
Hello! What's this?
Nice souvenir to show the neighbors back home. If I ever get home.
Who are you?
Bless us, my precious.
A tasty morsel it would make us.
What is it, my precious?
I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins.
I've lost my dwarves, my wizard and my way.
Mind you, I'm armed with an elvish blade!
That's better.
Perhaps you know the way out?
But perhaps we sits here...
...and chats with it a bitsy, my precious?
Lt... likes... riddles?
Do I like riddles?
Well, yes, after a fashion.
It must have a competition with us.
If precious asks and it doesn't answer...
...we eats it, my precious.
Oh, I say!
But if it asks us...
...and we doesn't answer...
...then we...
...shows it...
...the way out!
- It seems I have no choice.
- My precious...
...we makes the first riddle.
Voiceless, it cries
Wingless, flutters
Toothless, bites
Mouthless, mutters
Can it...
...guess...
...the answer?
Half a moment.
Is it nice, my precious?
Is it juicy?
Gooey? Yucky?
Is it scrumptious?
If you please!
Wind! Wind is the answer.
Now, my turn.
A box without hinges, key or lid
Yet golden treasure inside is hid
Let us give us a chance, my precious.
Eggs!
Eggs, it is!
Oh, bother!
Us now! Now us, my precious.
I'm aquiver with anticipation!
Now...
This thing, alls things devours
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers
Gnaws iron, bites steel
Grinds hard stones to meal
Slays king, ruins town
And beats high mountain down
Well, interesting.
Yes, now, let me see.
What does it answer?
What does it answer?
Just a moment now!
My precious...
...will it taste delicious?
It will!
- Give me some time.
- What?
What does it say?!
I said time! Time!
Whatever is the matter?
It guess!
Time is the answer!
It is?
I knew it all along.
That's an old one.
Well, fun's fun.
Now, couldn't we get out of here?
It's got to ask us another riddle, my precious!
Blast, I can't think of another one.
Ask! Ask!
Oh, very well.
- What have I got in my pocket?
- Not fair!
Not fair to ask my precious...
...what it's got in its nasty...
...little pocketeses!
I'm sorry. That's my riddle.
And if you can't guess it, you lose and show me out!
My precious loses!
But first...
...my precious shows it...
...his something pretty.
- You wish to show me something?
- My birthday present.
Wait! Where are you going?
My precious finds a ring...
...on his birthday...
...long ago.
A golden ring.
A magic ring!
We must get my precious' birthday present from its hiding place.
Now what?
He'll never guess my pocket contained this.
Bless my soul!
Where is it?
My golden ring! My magic ring!
Lost, it is.
Lost!
Lost!
Curse us and crush us! My ring, lost!
My precious remembers.
He wears it before.
And he drops it on the shore!
Curse it! Curse the Baggins!
He's found it! My ring!
My birthday present!
My, he does carry on.
Bless my soul!
The ring?
Most definitely.
My precious will find it!
Will find it! The Baggins.
My precious will crush it...
...and smash it!
Better douse this.
Where is it?
Where is it?
It is tricksy.
It says it doesn't know the way out...
...but it knows the way in, my precious.
It must...
...know a way out!
It's off for the back door.
My precious must make haste to the back door.
To the back door!
How convenient.
Well, follow the leader.
It's not here, my precious.
It's make an escape!
Ta-ta!
Thief!
Thief!
Baggins!
We hates it!
Hates it forever!
Gollum thought I knew the way out and was trying to head me off.
I merely followed him to the exit.
We had to fight our way through the goblin guard.
- How is it they didn't see you?
- Oh, well...
...the art of burgling is really, you know...
...the art of being unobtrusive.
Invisible, so to speak.
Your story has the ring of truth.
Yes, it rings true.
You need say no more.
We'd best get a move on.
There are still goblins about.
Oh, bother! More mountains?
No. Don't you see?
The sun is setting in the west, behind the mountains.
We're on the other side, to the edge of the land beyond.
- The Wargs!
- With the goblins!
- Help!
- We can't go any higher!
- My arms.
- My poor legs! My legs!
But what will they do with us?
Drop us to our deaths?
Who knows?
But they've brought us a far distance with no dropping!
Behold, the River of Wilderland below!
By thunder!
They're taking us to the edge of Mirkwood Forest...
...to dash us against those rocks,
I know it!
O Great Lord of the Eagles...
...we are eternally grateful for your gallant rescue.
I have not forgotten the arrow...
...that brought me down so many years ago.
I have not forgotten the wizard...
...who found me and healed my wound.
And now...
...farewell, wherever you fare...
...till your aeries receive you at the journey's end.
So this is the Forest of Mirkwood.
Terrible place, if I remember.
And dangerous.
Now, now.
The map shows the safest path.
Follow it closely, straight through the forest.
Don't stray off the track.
If you do, you will never get out.
You speak as if you weren't going with us.
I'm not. I have pressing business away south.
- Oh, no! He can't mean it.
- What will we do without Gandalf?
Please, don't leave us.
I'm already late because of bothering with you people.
I'm sending Mr. Baggins with you.
That should be enough.
- Mr. Baggins?
- Bilbo?
The burglar?
Me? I'm no equal to a wizard!
Nonsense. You are the lucky number.
And you'll soon find out there's more about you than you guess.
You, sir, will be my surrogate.
My replacement, so to say.
Here is paper and a marker.
IKeep a strict log of your journey...
...so I may study it when we meet again and point out your missteps.
I can only do my best.
Then that will have to suffice.
To Gandalf:
As per your instructions...
...I am keeping this log of our journey through Mirkwood Forest.
I shall make good use of it someday as a basis for my memoirs...
...which I intend to call:
There and Back Again:
A Hobbit's Holiday.
The days are terrible, and the nights are impossible...
...for we are hungry and thirsty.
The berries which grow here are hideous.
Everything about these woods is unpleasant.
One day we decided someone...
...should climb to the top of the tallest tree and have a look.
I couldn't argue. My contract is vague on several points.
There are moments...
...which can change a person for all time.
And I suddenly wondered if I would ever see my snug hobbit hole again.
I wondered if I actually wanted to.
I awoke the next morning to a hideous surprise.
Now I will give you a name.
And I shall call you Sting!
The rest of the morning
I spent seeking my companions.
And I found them, finally, in a place as black and terrible...
...as a patch of midnight that had never been cleared away.
They'll make fine eating...
...when they've hung a bit!
Go away!
Go away!
Bombur!
I certainly could not let my companions, my comrades...
...become a meal for those hideous spiders. Action was called for.
You are all free. I know the spiders' poisons have made you weak.
But you must follow me. Quickly!
Look! On the path ahead.
There it is.
It has freed our supper.
Now we see you!
We will eat you and leave your skin hanging in the tree.
Grab it!
I can hold them off!
Run to the wood-elves' clearing!
But, how can you...?
I will do the stinging! Run.
Swiftly now.
We've trapped it now.
Close the circle.
It can't escape us!
Lazy lob! Attercop!
Blast! What is it?
What is it called?
Sting! Sting! Sting!
Away! Retreat!
We are no match for Sting!
I joined my companions at the clearing of the wood-elves.
But when I found them,
I was in for another surprise.
The wood-elves had returned, but armed for battle.
The dwarves, weakened by their encounter with the spiders...
...gave up without a struggle.
We traveled all day and night.
Finally, we came to the palace of the Elf King...
...which was at the very eastern edge of the forest.
We'd come all the way through...
...only to end up as prisoners.
- Why did you dwarves try to attack?
- No attack!
We came to beg. We were starving.
Why were you in the woods in the first place?
- That is our business.
- Very well.
Take them away until they feel inclined to tell the truth...
...even if they wait 100 years!
Greed. The fortune we were after was big enough to share with the elves.
They'd make valuable allies against that old worm Smaug.
Instead, they became the enemy, and we were their prisoners.
And even though my invisibility allowed me to move about with ease...
...I had no way of opening the locks.
So it was weeks before I found a way to free my companions.
The river flowed under the caves.
Deliveries of fine wines were brought up the river...
...by human men who lived on Long Lake.
Now, wood-elves enjoy their wine, and the barrels were soon drained.
Oh, stop complaining!
I never promised to burgle you first-class accommodations.
I'd come far, and through many adventures, to see it...
...and now I did not like the look of it at all!
Within hours we'd reached the human colony called Laketown.
A precise, if not too imaginative name...
...for the village was actually built on the surface of Long Lake.
The descendants of the men of Dale still dared to dwell...
...and do business in the shadow of old Smaug's mountain.
I am Thorin...
...grandson of
IKing Under the Mountain!
I have returned!
Hail, Thorin Oakenshield.
I am Bard the guardsman.
We are honored by your presence.
Your grandfather lives in our songs and legends.
What help we can offer will be yours, and we trust to your gratitude...
...when the dragon Smaug is killed and your kingdom is regained.
We were fed, fattened, given supplies...
...and two weeks later found us nearing the end of our journey.
And chances were it would be a very horrible end, indeed.
That smell!
I've not smelled dragon before.
All the halls within must be filled with his foul reek.
And while Smaug slept inside...
...we spent our days searching for that elusive secret door.
Then, one afternoon...
And so, Gandalf, while I wait, I inscribe the final pages of your log.
My only companion is an annoying bird, cracking snails.
"Stand by the gray stone when the thrush knocks...
...and the last light of the setting sun...
...will shine upon the keyhole."
Oh, my goodness!
Wake up! Wake up! It's happening!
By thunder!
There it is!
Thorin, before it's gone again, use your key.
Well, here we are.
But what now?
Now is the time for our esteemed
Mr. Baggins to perform the service...
...for which he was included in our company.
You must earn your reward.
We do have a contract.
You think it's my job to go in first?
I've already gotten you out of two messes not in the original bargain.
And who will come with me?
Any of you?
I see.
Well, you are the burglar.
Go down and burgle something.
Very well. I won't refuse.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I've begun to trust my luck more than in the old days.
Now you're in for it at last,
Bilbo Baggins.
Why are you here?
You've no use for dragon treasures.
Feel the worm's heat, Mr. Baggins?
A few more steps and you shall see...
...the old dragon Smaug at last.
You can still turn back, you know.
But to go on, to take those steps...
...that would be the bravest of all moments.
Whatever happens afterwards is nothing.
Yes, here is where you fight...
...your real battle,
Mr. Bilbo Baggins.
Do you go back?
Well, thief...
...I smell you, feel your air.
I hear your breath.
Come along!
Help yourself. There's plenty, and to spare.
Thank you, oh, Smaug the Magnificent.
I did not come for presents.
I only wish to have a look at you...
...and see if you are truly as great as tales say.
I did not believe them.
Do you now?
They fall utterly short of reality...
...O Smaug the Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities!
You have nice manners, for a thief...
...and a liar.
You know me...
...but I don't remember smelling you before.
Who are you and where do you come from?
I come from under the hill.
And under the hill and over the hills my paths led.
And through the air.
I am he that walks unseen.
You make riddles?
What is your name?
I am the lucky number, the web-cutter, the spider-stinger...
Lovely titles.
I am he that drowns his friends and draws them alive again from the water.
I am the guest of eagles, the ring-winner and luck-wearer...
...the clue-finder and the barrel-rider.
Barrel-rider, eh?
Then I have guessed your riddle!
You are one of those miserable...
...tub-thumping Lake-men!
You and your town shall pay dearly for this intrusion!
So the Lake-men would steal my treasure?
Wait! You don't know everything.
Not gold alone brought me hither.
Be done with your riddles!
What else brought you, Lake-man?
Revenge!
Revenge?
Surely you realize that your success...
...has made you some bitter enemies.
Revenge? You? Ha!
I am Smaug!
I kill what I wish!
I am strong...
...strong...
...strong!
My armor is like tenfold shields...
...my teeth are like swords...
...my claws, spears...
...the shock of my tail...
...a thunderbolt!
My wings...
...a hurricane!
And my breath...
...death!
Well?
Well?!
Where are your riddles now?
Very, very impressive.
However...
...I have always understood that dragons...
...were soft underneath. Vulnerable.
Especially in the region of the chest.
You have heard wrong!
I am armored both above and below.
Well, I don't know about that.
You "don't know about that."
I shall show you!
Look!
What do you say to this?
Rare and wonderful, eh?
Dazzling!
Marvelous!
Perfect!
Flawless!
Staggering! Mag...
Old fool!
There's a patch in the hollow of your left breast...
...as bare as a snail out of its shell.
What's that?
More riddles?
No, my riddling is done.
I really must not detain
Your Magnificence any longer.
Sorry you could not find me. But a fine burglar takes expert catching.
Burglar?
Burglar!
Thief! Fire! Murderer!
- We should have gone with him!
- To be roasted alive?
It's the burglar!
Three cheers for good old Bilbo!
Thank you! But I'd appreciate a more pragmatic salute.
In other words...
...extinguish me!
There we go! There we go!
Always glad to help a friend.
I can't tell you how grateful I am.
Never mind that.
What did you burgle?
This.
What's that?
Earthquake?
Into the secret passage!
Our only chance!
Barrel-rider!
Thieving Lake-man!
Your people shall see my vengeance!
The Lake-people are doomed unless...
Yes! You, who are a mere thrush, and yet so much more.
You have seen Smaug.
You know his vulnerable spot!
Go now, to Laketown. There is a guardsman, Bard. Tell him!
This breeze is strangely warm for autumn.
Bard! What's that?
The dragon is coming, or I'm a fool!
Cut the bridges! To arms! To arms!
The dragon! Old Smaug!
Awake after all these years!
The dragon is coming!
Ready? As he passes over...
Arrows!
Stand your ground. Rearm!
Away, you fool bird! Away!
You speak?
Bilbo Baggins?
He found what?
Yes! I'll look.
Jove! You speak the truth, old thrush!
Black arrow, you've never failed me.
I've always recovered you.
I had you from my father and he from of old.
If you came from the true king's forges under the mountain...
...go now and speed well!
Now I am king!
Stop!
There is only one IKing Under the Mountain, and I am he...
...Thorin!
Hail Thorin!
Hip-hip-hooray!
Now, now...
...there's much to be done.
We must catalog our wealth.
Dear me! And pack it for shipment.
Join the fun, Burglar!
Part of this is yours!
Might be mine!
What if Smaug returns?
Oh, he's been gone for a week now!
Found greener pastures, no doubt.
Has this wealth made you mad?
We must find our way out of this mountain...
...and see if he's gone, and quickly!
According to this map, the main gate lies in this direction.
Follow me, gentlemen!
Bless my soul.
What are they?
Is the entire valley floor populated by giant fireflies?
Not fireflies, fires! Campfires!
Nonsense! Only an army would need that many fires.
No, my friend. Two armies!
Bard of Laketown? What did you say?
Two armies!
Smaug is dead. I have slain him.
The thrush delivered your message.
Really? Splendid news, old fellow.
I hoped he would!
My people have made me king.
IKing? Really? Congratulations!
Couldn't happen to a nicer chap.
I don't know how to thank you.
Our town is destroyed and must be rebuilt.
You can thank us by sharing your fortune.
Why, of course, of course.
There's plenty for all.
Wait! The fortune is ours and belongs to dwarves alone!
It wouldn't be yours if Smaug still lived.
A technicality.
- So you brought two armies to take it?
- I brought one army.
The other is mine!
You, who threw us into the dungeon?
My people have suffered greatly from the worm through the years.
We demand retribution.
Never!
Why not? There's enough for all in this mountain.
It's a matter of principle, of honor!
Then tomorrow we take it!
We will meet at sunrise on the field of battle.
You are hopelessly outnumbered.
This is ridiculous!
Quiet! What does a burglar know of these matters?
Then tomorrow it is!
This is deucedly uncomfortable.
I'm certain to get a rash.
That armor was forged in the foundries of my grandfather.
Wear it proudly and it will carry you to victory!
Confusticate and bebother victory!
My only hope is to be taken prisoner as quickly as possible.
Those are the words of a coward.
The coward who flushed out Smaug?
The coward who saved you time and time again?
The coward who always went forward while you cringed behind?
You don't see us cringing now, do you?
This is madness!
Fourteen against 10,000...
...and yet you march off to certain destruction...
...as merrily as if you were on your way to a tea party.
Your kind will never understand war, hobbit.
This is war. War!
Our lookout has spied something!
O great IKing Under the Mountain!
- Balin, it's only Thorin!
- Quiet!
- Yes, general?
- "General"?
Another army approaches from the northeast!
An army of our kind.
An army of dwarves!
- My cousin Dain from the Iron Hills?
- None other!
Ha! Now we are not outnumbered!
Now we have an army!
- A battle of three armies?
- To war!
Onward!
Forward!
To battle!
- Scurvy dwarves!
- Thieving dwarves!
IKill them!
- Chop them!
- Take their heads!
IKill the men! IKill the elves!
Save the gold for ourselves!
I'd rather be back in Hobbiton.
- Who's that old man?
- Get out of the way!
Move, you old fool!
Old fool?
Gandalf!
Halt!
I would speak with the kings!
Dread has come upon you all!
An army of goblins with claim to the treasure comes from the north!
Behold!
They ride upon wolves!
O great Elf IKing, my truest friend and ally.
We must join forces against this kind of scourge.
But of course, O noble
IKing Under the Mountain.
Your people are like brothers unto mine.
My men and all their weapons are as one with yours.
Together we will vanquish the foul foe!
Together!
Thorin is correct. I simply do not understand war.
A battle of four armies.
One, two, three... Yes, four!
Our cause is hopeless!
The goblins are too powerful!
We'll spill much of their blood before the day's finished!
If these be our last moments, let us live them with honor!
Hold! All is not lost.
The goblins have many enemies.
There is yet still another army on the way.
The eagles!
Five armies now?
Mr. Bilbo Baggins, enough is enough.
Bombur! You're hurt!
I still live. And you?
A slight wound. Crack on the head.
Out for hours. What happened?
We won.
Bombur gone too?
Of our original 13, how many are left?
Seven.
And Thorin?
Soon there will be only six.
I have brought him.
Farewell, good thief.
I wish to part in friendship...
...and take back my words at the gate.
There are many words I would take back also.
And does it take this...
...to make us see each other?
- Thorin!
- Hush.
You are no coward, my friend.
I am sorry I so named you.
- This is not important...
- And I was wrong.
You did understand war.
It was I who did not.
Until now.
Farewell, IKing Under the Mountain.
Child of the kindly west.
I have come to know...
...if more of us valued your ways...
...food and cheer above hoarded gold...
...it would be a merrier world.
But sad or merry...
...I must leave it now.
- Farewell.
- Farewell, Thorin.
You take only two tiny bags of gold home with you?
Your share was greater.
It's all my pony could carry, and it's more than I'll ever need.
But you have other prizes.
The ring? Oh, yes.
I'll keep it as a souvenir, in a glass box on the mantel.
And so the prophecies of old have come true.
Smaug is gone and the goblins driven away.
The dwarves and elves live in peace...
...and the men thrive, multiply and build a civilization.
Prophecies!
- What?
- I had a hand in all that!
You disbelieve the prophecies because you helped bring them about?
You don't really suppose...
...that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck...
...just for your sole benefit?
You're a very fine person,
Mr. Baggins. I'm very fond of you...
...but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all.
Thank goodness!
Yes, you will return to your home...
...place your souvenir ring on your mantel...
...publish your story, which you believe has come to its end...
What do you mean, believe has come to an end?
It has, hasn't it?
Oh, Bilbo Baggins, if you really understood that ring...
...as someday members of your family not yet born will...
...then you'd realize that this story has not ended...
...but is only beginning.
NARRATOR:
A time of beginnings.
Of darkness.
Of light.
Of the sun.
The earth.
The sea.
Of man.
The beginnings of man living with man.
By the sea.
In the mountains.
The beginnings of love, hate and fear.
Man's fear of the unknown.
Man's fear lest the sun should leave him.
Leave him alone in everlasting darkness.
A time when the color of a woman's hair condemned her for sacrifice to the sun.
A time when there was, as yet, no moon.

THE EMIGRANTS
"This is a story of a group of people who emigrated to North America from their homes in Ljuder parish in the Swedish province of Småland.
In 1844, the parish of Ljuder had 1,925 inhabitants.
The population had tripled in a hundred years.
Besides 254 landed farmers and tenant farmers, there were 39 artisans,
92 landless peasants, and 11 enlisted soldiers.
There were also
274 farmhands, 127 paupers,
60 cripples, five halfwits, three idiots, three whores, and two thieves.
Four men governed the parish by virtue of their spiritual and temporal offices:
Brusander the dean,
Lönnegren the sheriff,
Paul Rudeborg, landowner, lieutenant, and knight, and Per Persson, churchwarden and storekeeper.
It was the same in all other parishes at the time.
Let each and every man obey the authorities above him, for there is no authority but of God.
The powers that be have been ordained by God.
Whosoever therefore resisteth the authorities resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.
For those who have authority strike fear in the hearts not of those who do good but of those who do evil.
Wouldst thou not be afraid of those in power?
Then do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same.
For they are servants of God and work for thy welfare.
Amen."
I'll have more salted herring.
Have some bread.
You can't just eat fish.
Is it good?
Yes.
She salted it last week.
How long were you a farmhand, Father, before you took over here?
Twelve years.
But those 12 years weren't all in Ålarum?
No, they weren't.
It's no kingdom you're taking over, son, but it's twice as much land as I took on 25 years ago.
But if you're going to be a farmer, you'll need a woman too.
I figure I can get a good one if I want.
Don't brag like that, son.
Kristina!
Eat now.
If only we had a horse, but the land can't feed one.
You've tilled all the tillable land.
Hard as we try, we can't improve our lot.
"By the sweat of thy brow must thou earn thy bread."
That doesn't guarantee you anything to eat.
Do you have money for the mortgage?
We're 22 riksdaler short.
Kristina thinks I can borrow from her uncle in Kärragärde.
You can borrow from me.
I have to tell Robert about the cat.
She won't last much longer.
Something on your mind?
Snow at the end of April, and heavy snow at that.
Doesn't bode well for this year's crop.
No, it doesn't.
When will we sow now?
If the crops fail again this year,
I don't know what we'll do.
We must believe that God will make them grow.
Believe!
If believing helped... we could harvest a hundred bushels of rye by the fall.
We break our backs, but we're still losing ground.
After four years we still have no oxen, and we're 70 riksdaler deeper in debt.
Grant us suitable weather... and preserve the earth's bounty from ruin of every kind.
Bless us with barley and grain.
Through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen.
Karl Oskar, we better not.
What's wrong?
I'm thinking of the children.
They're all asleep.
I mean... I was thinking about food for the children.
Food?
I mean, maybe we shouldn't.
Then there wouldn't be any more.
"Maybe we shouldn't"?
For the rest of our lives?
Are we to stay away from each other forever?
I could never do that... not until I'm so old that moss grows out of my ears.
Can't you work for your food and clothing?
You're 15 now, aren't you?
You're strong and healthy.
- You can't stay here any longer.
- It's high time you worked.
Karl Oskar has enough mouths to feed.
Shame on you!
Your sister's been a farm servant for years and has never complained.
What's that book?
Natural sciences.
The schoolmaster gave it to me.
Rinaldo said he was good at reading.
He always said everyone should read the Bible and natural sciences.
This tells you all there is to know about the world.
It tells you about the body, about water.
Listen:
"You can hold wood or rock in your hand... but you can't do that with water.
For water is fluid and follows its own course.
All fluid things like water, ale, beer, or milk can form drops and are called liquids, because they're wet."
Well, if it isn't our little farmhand!
Didn't find your way to Nybacken this morning, did you!
Stop.
You deserve a good thrashing, but this time I'll let you off with a box to the ears.
Bedbugs.
I'll teach you to hurry it up!
Aren't you going to teach Robert too, Arvid?
Will you and the heifer see the pastor soon to announce your engagement?
"Notable grasses found abroad include sugarcane,
which grows six feet high and as thick as a man's arm."
Read about rice again.
"Rice is a cereal cultivated in unbelievable abundance in warmer countries.
The shelled grains are brought here as well, where they're cooked in milk to make our tasty white sweet porridge.
The best rice comes from beyond the ocean, from Carolina in North America."
How wide is the ocean?
It's all the fault of the Lord's weather.
Don't blaspheme, Karl Oskar.
Is this hay or cat's hair?
You took all the rest.
You can take this too.
You're blaspheming!
May God forgive you.
May God forgive you.
What's that you found?
Will we die too?
Yes.
When, Father?
Not for a long time.
If it doesn't rain soon, we'll have no milk.
Remember all the vole hills we had last year?
Where'd you get that?
Aron's keg. I usually take part of my wages in liquor.
Aron said there'll be a catechism meeting here next week.
Last year the dean asked who our lords and masters were, but I couldn't answer.
"Our lords and masters are all those, together with our parents, whom God has given fatherly dominion over us, such as authorities, teachers, and governors."
Lord a-mercy!
You know how many lords and masters we have in all the world?
No.
First there's the king, Oscar I.
Second is the county governor.
Third is the chief constable.
Fourth and fifth are
Sheriff Lönnegren and his deputy.
Sixth is our dean.
And seventh is Aron, our master.
Lord a-mercy!
What a heap of masters!
You know it now in case they ask next time?
First... is the king.
What was his name?
- Oscar I.
Then there's —
The county governor.
The county governor.
Then comes the chief constable?
Then there's the dean.
King Oscar I.
Then comes... the county governor...
Arvid, what are you doing up?
Chopping wood in the middle of the night?
The old lady will die tonight.
Put the axe down.
I'll kill the old crone!
You're out of your mind!
Put that down!
I'll split her snout, the old bitch!
Listen to me!
Let go!
Listen to me!
You'll just get in trouble!
You don't know what you're doing!
- Let go, I said!
Let go!
Come inside now.
You know what they accuse me of?
Yes.
It's not true.
That old bitch made it all up.
I've never done anything unlawful with the heifer.
I believe you.
I've never believed what they accuse you of.
- Know what they call me?
- No.
The bull of Nybacken.
No wonder none of the girls wants anything to do with me.
Arvid...
I have a secret... and you're the only one
I'm going to tell.
Can I trust you?
You can't say a word to anyone.
I'll keep mum, even if they cut my head off.
I'm going to run away.
Run away?
In the fall, when they drive the timber to Karlshamn.
I'll catch a ship there that sails to America.
Will you come with me?
Will you come?
- Yes.
Look at this.
"Description of the United States of North America, along with information and advice for emigrants."
In America they're not divided into gentry and commoners, like here.
You can even address the president informally.
The best rice comes from Carolina in North America.
And salted herring is absolutely forbidden as food.
"In America no one works more than 12 hours a day.
Many slaves have better dwellings, food, clothing, and working conditions than most peasants in Europe.
They have their own hens and pigs and can grow what they like and sell the yield for their own profit."
I'll sell myself as a slave there.
It's forbidden for white folk to do that.
Forbidden? You just said
America's a free country.
Well, that trade is forbidden for white folk.
I'll go with you all the same.
How much is passage?
About 200 riksdaler.
Jesus!
Two hundred riksdaler!
I'll never scrape that together.
- You won't?
We forgot: We can go overland!
No, you can't walk to America.
Isn't there any way?
No, it can't be done.
America's an island.
Goddamn ocean!
Last year the crops rotted.
This year they're burning up.
This might get us through Christmas, but what do we make bread from then?
When will we die, Mother?
Nobody knows. Only God.
Father said we're all going to die.
A few drops.
Maybe we'll get a shower after all.
No, don't do that.
The barn's on fire!
It set fire to the barn!
You got your way.
That was your punishment.
There was nothing we could do.
That bit of rain didn't help.
Playing dollhouse, my little friend?
Dodging work are you, you lazy devil!
What's wrong?
What is it?
My ear hurts bad.
What am I going to do?
We can try some liquor on a wad of wool.
It will sting at first, but it'll pass quickly.
There.
It's a little better.
But it's still roaring.
It sounds like a whole ocean in there.
Can you hear it?
No.
You're back already?
Karl Oskar?
What is it?
I broke the plow on a huge goddamn rock.
The earth here is cursed.
There's no need to swear and blaspheme.
It's not like you.
You can fix the plow, can't you?
Everything goes wrong no matter how we break our backs.
And there are more and more of us.
We must leave our worries to God.
I'm not sure he'll feed the children if we sit twiddling our thumbs.
Is it God's duty to feed all the children you're the cause of?
What do you mean?
I mean you shouldn't blame the Lord when you make your wife pregnant.
But darling...
I've never denied that I have a share in that.
You complain that there are more and more of us as if it were my fault!
I've never blamed you!
When you never say a word to me, what am I to think?
Surely you know that you and the children mean the world to me.
Do you care about me the way you used to?
Of course I do.
We have to stick together.
We have to help ourselves, because no one else is going to.
Poor child.
What a beating he gave you!
Come in, Karl Oskar.
Look.
Who did that?
- Aron.
- Why?
I bumped into a wall yesterday with a load of turnips and broke a bar on the wagon, and he beat me with a fence post.
I'm not going back.
Aron won't let him go just like that.
He was hired for the year.
Aron will send for the sheriff.
I'm not going back.
You don't have to.
No one in our family has to take a flogging.
We're just as good as Aron.
Wouldn't it be better to patch things up with Aron?
I'll go talk to him.
You stay here.
Come in your brother's place, have you?
Now I have a proper farmhand.
You can find another farmhand to beat.
You're not getting any more from my family.
The sheriff will bring him back.
Let me go!
Come get him yourself.
You're welcome to come to Korpamoen.
I'm looking for your brother, the farmhand Robert Nilsson.
He's not here.
If your brother stays here in my district,
I'll get him.
Go inside now.
...and everything's left for me to do.
You said you'd handle it.
Now I'll have to do it myself.
Well, answer!
Shut your trap!
I've had enough of your nagging!
Goddamn bitch!
You could help now and then, but you never do. You hear me?
I'm sick and tired of you!
Shut up!
Shut your mouth, you old witch!
Hell and damnation!
The devil take her!
Lönnegren's a decent guy all the same.
I could see his point.
You can stay with Kristina's parents at Duvemåla for now.
That's outside
Lönnegren's district.
We can think up something later.
You're kind, Karl Oskar.
Now I have something else to ask of you.
Sure, if I can give it to you.
I want to take out my share in the farm.
I'm going to North America.
Surprised you, didn't I?
I never dreamed you had the same idea as me.
Look at this.
It's a wheat field in —
A wheat field in North America.
"Hardworking farmers have excellent prospects in the United States of North America."
What do you think?
We may have to work just as hard as here... but there we can prosper from our work, which we can't do here, no matter how we try.
Look at Father.
And what's to become of the children here?
Johan can take over the farm, but what about the others?
Farmhands, or peasants with no land.
Will you take responsibility for taking them across the ocean... and putting their lives in danger?
If only someone else had gone before us, but no one from around here has.
Then I'll have to be the first.
You'll take that responsibility?
Someone has to... in all things.
INTERROGATION
OF FARMER DANJEL ANDREASSON
Do you admit,
Danjel Andreasson,
that the following persons lodge in your house:
soldier Severius Pihl, dishonorably discharged,
handicapped servant girl
Sissa Svensdotter, and spinster
Ulrika of Västergöhl and her illegitimate daughter Elin, and that you conduct meetings in your home with your house folk and neighbors?
That is true, Dean.
What do you do at these meetings?
I do what the clergy do not do.
I preach the true word of God.
It's the devil whispering answers in your ear!
In the presence of these upright and trusted men,
I hereby forbid you to concern yourself with anything pertaining to the ministry!
You have no power to forbid me.
Do you acknowledge that my authority comes from God?
No, Dean.
Do you refuse to obey law and order?
There is no law over the righteous.
Are you filled with such spiritual pride that you call yourself righteous?
I'm filled with God's spirit.
The guiding precepts for my conduct are the Bible and the dictates of my conscience.
Is it true you have accused me of leading souls astray and leading them headlong into hell?
Yes, sir. Is it not true that you sell liquor from the parsonage distillery?
It's my lawful right as owner of the farm.
When people get drunk on your liquor and commit violence, fornication, and other offenses against God's commandments, do not those who thus break
God's commandments incur hellfire?
You have been summoned for questioning, not me!
In the presence of these witnesses,
I forbid you to trespass upon the holy ministry.
Should you persist in this criminal practice, you can be tried by a court of law, fined, and imprisoned on bread and water, and, upon a third offense, banished from the kingdom for two years!
But you cannot for one moment banish me from God's kingdom.
"Despite the warning,
Danjel Andreasson continued his unlawful preaching.
Dean Brusander therefore invoked church discipline against him and banished him from the Lord's Holy Communion and the fellowship of the church."
May the body of Christ that you are about to receive preserve thee unto everlasting life.
May the blood of Christ that you are about to receive preserve thee unto everlasting life.
May the body of Christ that you are about to receive preserve thee unto everlasting life.
May the blood of Christ that you are about to receive —
Danjel dear, don't open it!
Our Lord Jesus Christ is with us.
We have nothing to fear.
Who is it that disturbs the peace of our house at night?
Sheriff Lönnegren.
Open up!
Whom do you seek in my house at this late hour?
You yourself, Danjel Andreasson.
In the name of the law,
I order you to open this door.
I do not obey the law of man that you mention.
If you won't open the door, it's my duty to break it down.
Then I will spare you from adding to your burden of guilt by committing violence in the presence of the Lord.
What are these folk doing here in the middle of the night?
We are gathered for a love feast.
Poor misguided souls!
You defile the Holy Sacrament!
We are partaking of the blessed sacraments.
You can see he's administering
Holy Communion to these creatures.
We are all witnesses to his criminal conduct.
Did you administer the sacrament to these persons?
Not yet to all.
You interrupted us.
But you know no one may give communion unless ordained.
- I know no such thing.
- The dean told you so.
I obey the Holy Scriptures, not the dean.
Nowhere in the Bible does it say that our Lord Jesus Christ was ordained.
Don't argue with this hairsplitter!
Take down the names of all those present.
I forbade you once to concern yourself with matters belonging to the ministry.
You will now suffer the full force of the law.
But I beg you all once again to consider your immortal souls.
If you repent of your errors,
I will receive you back into the church.
Away with all of you!
You darken the room, standing there black and evil as Satan himself!
I see that your heart remains unchastened, yet you take Christ's blood to your unclean lips!
I'm not afraid of you, you pot-bellied parson!
- You'd insult the dean, Ulrika?
- Mind yourself... or I'll insult you too!
You should wash your mouth out before addressing the clergy.
With vicarage liquor or parson's piss, eh?
- Hold your tongue, you old whore!
- Did you say whore?
If I'm a whore, Per Persson, then you're a whoremonger!
Remember when you came to me with money in one hand and your prick in the other?
When you told me to lie on my back?
You were very amenable then!
But that filthy whoremonger isn't forbidden communion in church!
No! Because he's friends with the pot-bellied parsons, those lazy lumps of lard wallowing in their own fat!
In virtue of your office,
I think you should disperse this assembly and dismiss those present.
And I strictly forbid you to continue giving Holy Communion at this table.
You cannot turn the Lord Jesus out of my house.
You think your ramblings are revelations from God, but they're from the devil!
Get out of here, bloated lovers of the flesh!
In silence must I endure accusations
And walk on in innocence
Forgiving and forgetting
Sure in the knowledge
That God will judge aright
"Sentences handed down in the spring of 1849: for Danjel Andreasson, a fine of 200 silver riksdaler.
For the others at the meeting, a fine of 100 silver riksdaler or 28 days imprisonment on bread and water."
May the body of Christ that you are about to receive preserve thee unto everlasting life.
Can I have some porridge?
Not now.
You'll have some this evening, after your brother's baptism.
I want some porridge.
You can't have any!
Go see Granny.
You'll have porridge this evening, when company comes and we baptize the little lad.
Those children are here again.
Poor wretches.
They won't find much.
Anna! What are you —
Outside now!
Shame on you!
Go outside!
It's a shame to send them here.
They should keep them at home.
We have no more than they have.
You can't eat that.
Mother can make soup from it.
Soup! No, take this.
Run home now.
Father's little helper is here, eh?
Aren't you cold?
Run back to Mother now.
Anna!
Little one.
You'll be all right soon.
I'll wipe your face.
Did you stuff your tummy?
Her stomach's all swollen.
Shouldn't we send for Berta in Idemo?
Let's see how our little girl is.
She's very sick.
The grain in the porridge has swollen up to twice its size.
Her stomach may have burst, in which case there's nothing I can do.
We'll have to see how she is in the morning, whether she's taken a turn for the better.
If not, I'm afraid God will take her home to him.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
But let's hope she'll get better.
You never know what might happen.
You've been choosing timber all day.
Why don't you let me make the coffin?
Why don't you let me put it together?
I'm not against moving to America anymore.
Don't touch the wash with your filthy fingers.
Leave it alone.
Don't get it dirty now that it's clean.
We'd better take this with us too.
Grandpa can keep that one.
"On tracks like these you travel at great speed —
10-20 miles an hour, and even faster.
Many large carriages are coupled together and pulled along by a steam engine.
Strong wooden crossbeams are laid on the road, and to these are fastened strong iron rails, which serve to guide the carriages.
Each carriage is furnished so comfortably that it makes disembarking unnecessary, even on long journeys.
These railroads, which with the aid of steam allow one to enjoy a comfortable and exciting journey, now cover a distance of 8,000 miles in America."
You can gather enough winter fodder for a cow in two days, and for a horse in three.
I'm wondering about those railroads.
If they lie out on the ground unguarded night and day, doesn't the iron get stolen?
No, they have so much iron there that no one bothers to steal so much as a filing.
It's the same with gold and silver.
In America they hang a thief straight off... usually before he's had time to confess.
Americans are the most honest and upright people in the world.
I expect they have a few bastards there too.
- You're taking a lot of folk.
- There'll be six of us.
There'll be more.
You'll have more descendants than you know.
And you never asked your children's or grandchildren's opinion.
- I'm thinking of my children.
- And I'm thinking of mine.
Ever since you could unbutton your britches to piss, you've never asked your parents for advice or help.
And one shouldn't give unsolicited advice.
Does your ear hurt?
It'll be better once we get to America.
I read in the paper yesterday about a man who got home and found his whole family had been eaten by a crocodile.
It had eaten three children and just swallowed his wife, but her head got stuck in its throat, so it choked to death.
That was her revenge.
The ground all around was soaked in human blood.
Are we going to those parts?
You should know
Robert's imagination by now.
It's not my imagination.
I read it.
Could it be the sheriff?
Who is it?
It's Uncle Danjel.
May I come in?
God's peace on your house.
- Something wrong at home?
No, all is well with my wife and children.
What is it, then?
What is it?
I have a message for you,
Karl Oskar.
From whom?
From God.
The Lord woke me tonight and said...
"Go to Karl Oskar at Korpamoen, husband to thy dear niece."
He spoke to me as he once spoke to Abraham. He said...
"Go forth from thy fatherland and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee.
Go to Karl Oskar at Korpamoen.
He shall help thee."
Are you coming to America with us, Uncle?
We are living in a time of persecution in the land of my fathers.
I'm prevented from serving my God.
I've been banished from the land.
But the Lord will open a new land to me.
We shall go there together, and none of us shall know fear.
So there would be six of you, right?
Eight... counting children and household.
You're taking your lodgers too?
Yes, Ulrika and her girl are coming.
I promised them.
Would you have use for a farmhand, Uncle?
I would indeed.
The last one ran off when the persecution started.
I know one who'd be a great help in America.
His name's Arvid.
We shall place everything in God's hands.
He will aid us with all his mighty power to make it across the perilous sea.
You'll set a bad example for my other parishioners,
Karl Oskar Nilsson.
You're seen as an energetic and hardworking farmer.
Surely you can support yourself in your native district.
It seems I can't, Dean.
You have the bare necessities for your household.
Man should be content with the bare necessities.
Have you given sufficient thought to this adventure that you and your family are setting off on?
Do you know the truth about the country that so beckons to you?
Are you sure you haven't been misled?
Or tricked by fantasies and delusions?
This could be the ruin of you and yours, and I therefore advise against it.
You do know
I'm thinking of your welfare?
I'm sure you mean well, sir.
At least think of your parents.
Your father is a cripple.
The old folks are taken care of.
You're possessed by a spirit of discontent and blinded by lies —
I've sold everything off and am now free.
Perhaps I could have my business settled now?
You shall have your permit to emigrate.
Now I pray God to bless you and yours on your voyage to this faraway land.
May you never have cause to regret your bold decision.
My humble thanks, Dean.
Mother!
That's enough!
- That's enough.
- What? A little more!
No.
Aren't we going soon?
Who knows what trash they wear on their feet in America, but I needn't be ashamed of showing these there.
They weren't cheap.
Who'd have thought so many would emigrate all at once?
And now Jonas Petter too.
There's something
I have to tell you.
I'm in that way again.
I see.
It couldn't come at a more inopportune time.
What?
I mean it's awkward, coming just now.
I can't be with child when it suits you!
Don't take it like that.
It's not my fault alone!
It's yours too!
More than mine! You come to me at the "inopportune" time!
Why are you getting so upset?
You're afraid I'll be a burden!
I never said that!
I'm just afraid it will make it harder for you now.
We have to stick together or we'll never make it.
Let's be friends this last evening at home, all right?
Yes, of course.
I'm just not well.
I know, I know.
You must speak gently to me.
No harsh words, I promise.
Go slowly through the gate!
Lucky you're so slender, or I'd have to run alongside.
Arvid, when we get to Karlshamn,
I'm going to buy a book for learning English.
I figure I can learn it during the voyage.
You can borrow it if you like.
- I don't need it.
You can't speak English, can you?
Not yet, but when I step ashore in America, I'll be able to.
You'll speak it properly the minute you set foot ashore?
Yes.
Who said so?
Uncle Danjel.
You have to learn it, because you're not living in the spirit, but the rest of us needn't.
- Can that really be true?
- You think Danjel tells lies?
No.
When we go ashore, the faithful will be filled with the Holy Ghost, just like the apostles at Pentecost.
And all who are reborn in Jesus Christ will speak American fluently the moment they step ashore.
You never read the Acts of the Apostles?
Sure... but I've never heard of being filled with the Holy Ghost like that.
Robert...
I'm afraid of America.
Afraid? Why?
Maybe they're mean to newcomers there.
No.
You needn't be afraid.
They have so few women in America that they treat them like gold and precious stones.
You'll be pampered like a baby and given anything you want.
...they have a steam wagon that pulls everything, and so that the wagons in back don't slip off, they attach hooks —
The peace of God be with you!
Well, the vicar lay there with his rod sticking up as stiff as a church candle.
They couldn't bury him like that, so they called in all the other churchmen.
Dean Stenmark himself was there.
They read over him, but it wouldn't go down.
Satan wouldn't leave his body.
It just stayed that way.
Well, along came his old housekeeper, Magda, and asked if she could have a try, so they let her in where the body was kept.
She was in there all night, and in the morning there he lay just like all other men who are to be buried.
I wonder if we'll be seasick on the ship.
It's not so bad.
You just throw up a bit.
Like when you're in the family way.
They say it's so painful.
Don't you remember what I said, Inga-Lena?
Have you forgotten what I told you?
- Of course not, Danjel dear.
Those who have Christ within them need not fear that sickness.
They can bear the sea, even if they're not used to it.
I believe you. I'm not afraid.
You don't think you'll get seasick like everyone else?
No, Karl Oskar.
Our Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross for my sins.
You're a doubter, Karl Oskar.
I've heard that married women get seasick more than other women.
Not if they live in the spirit,
Jonas Petter.
But most women live in the flesh.
They can spawn bastards even in the marriage bed.
But aren't scurvy and cholera worse than seasickness?
- What are they?
- I heard that —
Let us give thanks to God on this first day of our journey.
We thank thee, Lord, for holding thy hand over us on this first day of our journey.
INTERMISSION
Johan!
- Where are our berths?
- [ Speaking Danish ] Let's see.
You and you... come away from there.
- Karl Oskar!
- Coming!
Here?
I want a berth with my family.
I don't understand what you're saying.
May I speak to the captain?
The beasts in my barn have more room.
It's just greed.
PASSENGERS AND CARGO
Nice to get some fresh air.
Sure is.
I counted 16.
Me too.
- Shall we pace her out?
- Sure.
So far and no further.
We're not allowed any further.
- How many did you count?
- Thirty-six.
Me too.
What if the sea rises?
We'll all drown.
No.
If the sea rises, so does the ship.
How many are there of you?
Don't all come running.
One person per family.
They keep popping out babies, these people!
Come here.
And bring something to carry the food in.
You can't just jump in line.
That's enough.
- Don't we get any potatoes?
- There are none.
No milk either?
We don't have goats on board.
I don't want to be on the boat.
I want to be home.
We don't get any potatoes.
They don't have any.
They gave us pickled cabbage instead.
- No milk either?
- No, not for the whole voyage.
It reeks of piss here! You need a clothespin for your nose.
- When can we use the galley?
- Not for a while.
It's more crowded down here than church on Christmas morning.
- Little Märta's forehead is so hot.
- Is it?
- She won't eat anything.
- How are you, little one?
You think she caught something from that girl over there?
No.
I expect it's just a cold.
That girl has quinsy.
She's so close to us!
Who?
The Glad One?
Why do they call her the Glad One?
I suppose because she's never sad.
If any woman should be sad, it's her.
If any woman should weep blood —
Never mind her.
You're right.
We have other concerns.
I'm so sad you can't stay here with us.
You ought to like that.
You always loved the swing.
We have so little water left, and you can't ask the mate for more.
He doesn't like you.
You can have some of our water.
We don't use much.
Thanks very much.
Where are you folks bound for?
We don't quite know yet.
What about you?
- We have a son in Minnesota.
- Is it good farming land there?
- Very good.
Our son has a hundred acres.
You don't say.
He's a clever lad.
He wrote that he has a hundred acres.
We're bringing him a grindstone as a present.
They're very expensive in America.
Is that so?
I'm in a bad way myself.
Got a bad heart.
It stops in the morning, but a pinch or two of snuff gets it going again.
It's a real bother... this thing is.
But it starts up again.
"The lips move very little and are neither rounded nor thrust forward.
It's especially important not to thrust the lips forward... particularly when making the difficult sh-sound."
Understand?
I'll show you.
You mustn't do that.
I don't stick my lips out like that when I speak Swedish either.
Make the sh-sound in Swedish.
"Seasick."
Don't stick your lips out so far.
Say it again.
That's good.
It won't hurt you to learn a bit of English now.
Then, when you go ashore in America, you'll have helped out the Holy Ghost a bit.
That can't be a sin.
Say... shine... shall... shoot.
You have to learn the right tongue position too.
Stick your tongue out so I can see.
No, I don't think you'll have any trouble learning English.
Elin, come here.
Come help out here.
...it began to bleed, and he passed out.
But she'd already prepared a decoction of wild rosemary and bloodroot.
She stopped the bleeding, and when he came to, it had stopped.
He became a bit slow and dimwitted, but devoted to her all the same.
She saved what she had cut off and dried it and took it out sometimes for company on special occasions and such.
They say he still had a bit left, and that's why they called him Stumpy.
And that's as true as I sit here.
This is the life.
No goddamn farmer waking you up in the middle of the night to feed the horses.
And plenty of food too, so your belly's good and full.
I'm damned lucky I came along.
I'll go ask how much further it is.
How much further to North America?
It's as far from here to there as from there to here, with a difference of about 50 miles.
You goddamn sheep's cunt!
We peasants are no more stupid than folks like you that sail the sea.
What's wrong?
You're not sick, are you?
I'm covered in lice!
Dear God in heaven!
Don't look at me!
It's so awful!
Darling, don't cry.
I've never had a single louse in my whole life.
We've always been so clean, and I come out here to sea and get them!
Don't take it so hard.
You didn't bring them.
You must have caught them from another passenger.
It's you, you old whore!
You've given us all lice!
All your men have spread your vermin all around the parish.
Now you'd spread them to America too?
So your wife brought her lice along from home.
They couldn't bear to be separated from such a fine woman.
Admonish your wife, not me!
Now we're going to have it out,
Kristina of Korpamoen!
You accuse me of infesting this ship.
You accuse me of having vermin!
Danjel, she's reviled the body of Christ and his pure, innocent lamb.
Hold your peace, women.
She accuses me when she herself is full of lice.
Get down on your knees and apologize!
I'd sooner kneel before Satan himself!
You hear that?
She blasphemes!
Quiet, both of you!
Enough quarreling.
Ever since I was born again,
I've been free of lice.
I'll undress to my bare skin.
No one will find a louse on me.
Have you no shame?
You disgrace the very name of woman!
You accused me!
Anyone who likes can look!
Ulrika, beware!
Beware of the temptation of pride!
Your body is the wondrous work of the Lord.
You mustn't use it to arouse sinful lusts in men.
I will clear my name!
Inga-Lena will check my clothes.
She'll be my unbiased witness.
Come, Inga-Lena.
Now you've done it.
I called her a whore.
That's her proper name.
You shouldn't say such things about Ulrika.
Well, Inga-Lena, did you find any lice?
No.
Even a single nit?
No.
Hear that?
I'm innocent.
Kristina shall kneel to me.
Never!
I'd sooner jump in the ocean!
Down on your knees or I'll scratch your eyes out!
I won't have you on this ship!
Slut! Whore!
Danjel, look.
Me too. I have...
This creature too is part of God's creation.
It's been sent as a trial to us... so that we may better ourselves.
Things must be pretty bad in old Sweden when even the lice start emigrating to America.
My dear Inga-Lena... my dear spouse.
Dear wife, are you seasick?
My dear Danjel, forgive me.
Have you lost your faith?
Have you been listening to the enemy?
We're sinking!
It's just the storm.
Settle down.
Can't you feel that we're sinking?
You're just seasick.
Karl Oskar, I can't breathe!
You have as much air as I do.
Be quiet now.
In the dark
I can't even see where to vomit.
I drowned a cat once.
It suffered before it died.
You think I can be forgiven?
Don't talk rubbish.
I can hear it meowing down there.
You're just delirious.
Dear God, forgive me.
I've been an unfaithful servant.
Let me out!
Come on, Robert.
You can't lie here.
It can't be good for you, being shut up like a stallion.
Won't you eat a little?
Can you give the children something to eat?
They get enough to manage.
It's good they're well.
You'll be well soon too, once the sea calms down.
Would you like a spoonful of the Prince's Drops?
No.
Am I hearing things?
That young girl died.
It wasn't seasickness.
It was quinsy.
I have to tell you something.
What?
I'll never set foot in America.
No, Karl Oskar.
I've known ever since we came aboard.
I won't get out of here alive.
You and your notions!
Seasickness isn't fatal.
We'll make port in America, you and me.
Please!
Can't you wait a bit longer?
He often lies like this in the morning.
I have to shake him hard until he wakes up.
His heart stops sometimes, but then it starts again.
Your old man's as dead as he can be.
I know what dead folk look like.
Can't you please wait a bit longer?
Just one hour!
Till he starts to smell?
Just a little while!
Please!
You can't take him!
It's my turn now!
Why aren't we going to live in a house, Mother?
In America we'll live in a house.
It's a poor sort of wife you're taking to America.
You'll be fine when we get ashore.
Märta, come here.
Come here to Mother.
Come to me.
She's so grumpy.
What is it, Inga-Lena?
I feel so dizzy.
I'm not feeling well.
Lately I've had blood in my stool.
I suppose it's what they call scurvy.
You should lie down and let Danjel do your chores.
He mustn't know.
Poor man has enough worries.
Isn't he well either?
Yes, but he has to settle accounts with God.
He's suffering terribly.
He could still help out.
He needn't always be praying.
You mustn't tell anyone... but Danjel confessed that he committed the most heinous sin a man can commit.
He believed himself free of sin.
Then he was laid low with seasickness, and since then he's been a changed man.
He says there's but one righteous person on board: Ulrika.
She was spared both vermin and seasickness.
He says God has saved the ship for her sake.
Not Ulrika!
Don't say a word to Danjel about this or tell him I'm feeling out of sorts.
Promise me.
Good God, Kristina!
What's happened?
I'm so tired.
I can't go on.
- Are you in pain?
- No.
I'm so tired.
It's all the blood you've lost.
We have to stop the bleeding.
Lie still!
I don't want Mother to bleed anymore.
I'll go wake the captain.
No, don't leave me.
My wife's bleeding to death!
You have to do something!
Change the compress on her forehead every hour.
You'll be good to the children, won't you?
Of course.
That's good to hear.
You'll have to be both father and mother to them.
Don't talk like that.
Do you want anything?
No, nothing.
A lump of sugar?
I've been hiding them for you.
You're so kind... but I don't have the strength.
Kristina.
I want —
I want to ask... your forgiveness.
For what?
For wanting to come away.
I wanted to too.
But I insisted.
You wanted to make things better for all of us.
You mustn't be sad.
So you forgive me?
I have nothing to forgive.
Remember that.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm so very fond of you,
Karl Oskar.
I always have been.
We're the best of friends.
Yes, we are.
We're the best of friends.
I'll just sleep a bit now.
Yes, do.
Sleep now. You need it.
Just for a little while.
Go to sleep, but just don't —
Just don't —
Father.
Mother's stopped bleeding.
She's dead.
No, she's alive.
I think she's going to make it.
She died... just now.
But you can see for yourself!
Inga-Lena died just now.
She never told me she was so badly off.
She never complained.
Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.
Jesus Christ shall wake thee on the last day.
Among God's saints in heaven
The Lord said to you as he said to Moses...
"Thou shalt not enter that land."
My dear wife, it was not given to you either to see the new land.
You've gone before us to that other harbor.
But when I wanted to set out, you answered and said,
"Wherever you go... there I shall go.
Wherever you stay, there I shall stay.
Wherever you die, there I too shall die... and there I shall be buried."
You think we'll get there by midsummer?
Yes, I think so.
By then we'll have been at sea for ten weeks.
Shall we read the English book a bit?
If you like.
What was it you were to say when you looked for work?
"What can you do?"
"I am used to farm work."
I should practice mine too.
"I am the new servant girl."
"Wash your hands before you handle the food."
Damn it!
Why do they think all servant girls have dirty hands in America?
I don't know.
I suppose because everything's so nice and clean in the new world that they have to ask that of those who've come from the old dirty one.
Must you throw those away?
I can wash and mend them when I get ashore.
The sight of these would only upset us there.
And I don't want to be embarrassed in front of the Americans.
They'd see these rags and wonder what sort of people we were.
Robert!
They've sighted America!
Hold on tight.
Your turn now. That's it.
Hop ashore.
There's a big boy, going ashore by yourself.
What about our cargo?
As your interpreter, I'll handle it.
Look after it while I change currency with the captain.
I'll do that.
I heard you're coming with us,
Landberg.
It says something about California.
It's about ships to California.
The mate says every tenth person here is a thief.
He says every fifth woman is a whore too.
Is your ear hurting again?
No, it's just roaring.
He smells of liquor.
Come on.
Are you asleep, Kristina?
It's moving.
It'll be just fine. You'll see.
Close your eyes and smell.
It can't be!
Eat and drink your fill now.
There's plenty.
Have you ever seen such a beautiful apple?
I got it for nothing.
Let's see, now.
For you... and for you.
I think America's a good place.
We needn't be sorry we came.
Wait here.
I'll go find our places.
Robert, Arvid, this way.
We get on over there.
The train's starting. Hold on.
There's no danger.
Landberg... can't we open a door a bit?
They're locked.
They'll open them when we stop.
It ripped three fingers off his left hand.
That's how powerful the steam is when it escapes.
Suppose it escapes in here?
I don't think it will, but if it does —
That's some invention!
There ain't many back home who've enjoyed such comfort.
Do they collect the shit to fertilize the crops?
Remember how we promised to stick together no matter what?
- I'll never forget our promise.
Whatever happens in America, we'll stick together.
- What does that cost?
- Twenty-five cents.
Is it any good?
Oh yes. It gives relief for most illnesses — cholera, jaundice, baldness, and others.
Would you like a Painkiller?
- Please.
- Here you are.
Fine money they have!
Decorated with the heavenly stars.
They stand for the first 13 states.
Something's written under the woman on the throne.
It says, "In God we trust."
What? You hear that?
The creed is written right on their money!
It's a good and God-fearing land we've come to.
Let us praise the Lord that we've been allowed to come.
Aren't you going to eat, Uncle?
We have nothing left.
Fresh air!
I could do with some.
If you don't mind stale bread.
Thank you.
If there are no delays, we'll reach Buffalo this time tomorrow.
They almost look like the gentry at home.
You said people aren't divided into gentry and commoners here in America.
I only said they weren't divided into different classes.
I expect those are the ones who are well-off.
There are two kinds of people in America: those who've been here so long that they've gotten rich, and those so new here they haven't had time to get rich.
Just think: traveling on the water when they don't have to.
I just found out the truth, and you'll answer for it!
You deceived us.
- What on earth are you accusing me of?
You said we had just 250 miles to travel.
That's what the ship's captain said.
Our interpreter says it's 1,500 miles, and he's not one to lie.
You lied to us, you goddamn bastard!
Here we've crossed one ocean after the other, all because we trusted you.
Are you accusing me?
You old har—
Say it.
Say the whole word.
"You old harlot!"
Calm down!
You're both right.
American miles are much shorter than Swedish miles.
There are six to one Swedish mile.
You see?
If anyone else thinks
I've deceived them, step forward.
Calm down.
It was all a mistake.
No, I'm going to speak my mind.
I didn't ask all of you to come to Minnesota.
Where I'm going concerns my family alone.
You can all go settle wherever you goddamn like!
Calm down.
You have no reason to quarrel.
Shake hands.
- You heard what he called me!
You called me a liar!
Shake hands now and make up.
Shake hands.
Forget about her.
You know we trust you.
We're all very grateful to you.
I can't bear that woman any longer.
We'll part ways with her.
But she's part of Danjel's family, and she's good with the children.
I like her more now that we've arrived.
And Danjel told me how badly she was treated, sold at auction as a little girl.
Ulrika's turning plain crazy because she hasn't had a man for so long.
She needs a prick rammed up her as far as it will go.
You're alone?
Isn't Märta with you?
- No. Isn't she on board?
No.
- Are you sure?
- She was with you!
- I thought she was with you.
- She's still on shore!
Märta!
Karl Oskar, what's happened?
Is Märta there?
I haven't seen her.
Have you seen my little girl?
She's so little! Please!
She's not here.
You let her out of your sight!
She's fallen in the water!
Where is she?
The boat's leaving without us!
- We can't leave her behind.
- What about the other kids?
I'm staying here!
Please wait!
Märta is still on shore.
We have to look for her!
Hurry!
Hurry!
She was on the beach playing with shells.
She was having such fun that I was afraid she'd never come.
What did you say the disease is called?
Cholera.
She just brings it up again.
- Isn't there anything else?
- No.
No bread?
We'd do well to keep off the ship's fare.
It may be where the disease comes from.
Robert, put this somewhere no one will see it.
We have to buy milk!
O Lord... thou hast said I was to have no other gods before thee.
I idolized my daughter.
Now thou hast taken my idol from me.
I thank thee... my Lord and savior.
Respected sir, how can I reach Taylors Falls?
You understand what he's saying?
Yes.
What did he say?
Something about the weather.
The weather!
What did you ask him?
- How to get to Taylors Falls.
Did you understand what he said?
Something about the weather.
I'll ask someone else.
- Did you say what's in the book?
- Yes.
Everything's soaking wet.
I've never seen a man so handy in the kitchen.
Yes, that's the nicest, most kind-hearted man I've ever met.
You'd never guess he was a parson.
Do you know Anders Månsson?
I think it's close.
Can you ask him?
Robert, when we get there,
I won't go on living with Uncle Danjel.
What will you do?
I'll seek a position with a wealthy American family.
I don't intend to keep working for Karl Oskar long either.
What will you do?
I certainly won't be a farmhand.
I'll probably push on west to California.
California? What's there?
But you have to promise not to tell anyone.
Promise.
I promise.
- Did I hurt you?
- No, it's my ear.
It starts up now and then.
- Is it roaring like before?
- Your ear is roaring?
Can I hear it?
You can try.
Can you hear it?
We thank thee, O Lord, for our daily bread.
An alien land has generously opened its gates to us... and we have entered through them to dwell in peace and seek our livelihood.
But we'd be lost and wandering like newborn lambs had thou, O Lord, not helped us.
O everlasting Lord
From generation to generation
From land to land
Your hand protects the world from harm
In the morning
The flower opens
But it withers
Before the day's end
Just like that flower
Are all the people on the earth
Surely no one lives there.
It's just a barn.
Can you explain to him?
Have you no manners, boy?
Put that gun down!
What are you doing with a gun in the barn?
I wasn't expecting you.
I thought I'd never get here.
Where's Father?
Is Father dead?
As dead as all the others at the bottom of the sea.
Here's our iron pot.
One foot got knocked off.
You brought our old pot.
Come inside... all you Swedish folk.
Thank you. It was a long way, but we made it at last.
Why are you living in the barn?
This is my house, Mother.
This?
Anders, you wrote that —
Don't stand there telling your old mother fibs.
Show me your farm!
Come inside now.
Mother.
There's a forest over there — a fine and beautiful one.
We could put in a road here.
Two feet of good soil here too.
The sun has never shone on fairer ground.
No... better farming land you won't find in all creation.
It's a mosquito pit here.
Marshland on both sides.
You're never satisfied,
Karl Oskar.
We've gone far enough.
Let's stay here now.
There's plenty of room for the three of us.
It may be even better further on.
We should be grateful to the Lord for this place he's shown us.
If you're not happy with this spot, you're just plain picky.
You said you thought it was even better by the other lake.
- By Ki-Chi-Saga?
- That's right. Ki-Chi-Saga.
I don't know.
Not many have gone that far in.
I've come thousands of miles.
I can go a few more to have a look around Ki-Chi-Saga.
That way they can see that the land is claimed.
The greenest fields lie furthest away.

WHEN IT COMES TO OCCUPATIONAL
DISEASES, TRUCKERS GET THEM ALL.
I WAS HAULIN' A BARNYARD
OF PIGS THE OTHER DAY,
AND BY THE TIME I GOT HOME
I COULDN'T EVEN SMELL
MY OWN FEET.
???? [ Country On Radio ]
I STILL CAN'T SMELL !

- WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
A MAN NAMED STRODE ?
YOU SAW JACK.
WELL, FROM WHAT I HEAR,
HE'S A LOCAL SMOKEY...
OVER AT THAT OLD
BAUXITE GHOST TOWN.
THEY CALL IT TEXAS CITY NOW.
BEEN TRYIN' TO GET
TOURISTS IN THERE.
SET UP JUST AFTER YOU LEFT,
ALL LEGAL AND PROPER.
YOU CAN'T RUN A BOX LUNCH
THROUGH THAT TOWN WITHOUT
GIVIN' EVERYBODY A BITE.
THEY CHEW YOU UP,
TURN YOU AROUND,
SPIT YOU OUT.
DON'T YOU GUYS EVER TALK ABOUT
ANYTHING ELSE BUT TRUCKIN' ?
WELL, YES, WE DO, BUT NOT
IN THE PRESENCE OF A LADY.
J.D., HONEY,
WHAT'S A WELL-REFINED,
EDUCATED MAN LIKE YOU...
DOIN' ASSOCIATIN' WITH
THIS KIND OF RIFFRAFF ?
I'M WRITING AN ARTICLE
ABOUT THE LOWLIFE ON 99.
BE SURE HE SPELLS
YOUR NAME RIGHT, PEARL.
- I'LL HAVE THE USUAL, PEARL.
- SAME.
- HOWDY, J.D.
- HIYA, ELROY.
THERE'S THIS GUY
IN THE BILLIARD ROOM,
SAYS HE CAN BEAT YOU.
TELL HIM NO, THANKS.
I JUST GOT IN.
BUT YOU'RE THE CHAMP.
WHATEVER GAVE YOU
THAT IDEA ?
HE SAYS HE CAN
PUT YOU DOWN IN TEN SECONDS.
HI, ELROY.
HOWDY, MISS PEARL.
I BET HIM TEN DOLLARS
HE COULDN'T DO IT.
HERE HE COMES.
HOWDY, CHAMP.
MY NAME'S KAMINSKI.
J.D. DAWES.
I'M GONNA PUT YOU DOWN, CHAMP.
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO,
ESPECIALLY FOR MONEY.
- SHIT.
- WHY NOT ?
I DON'T WANNA
TAKE YOUR MONEY.
IF YOU DON'T FIGHT,
I'M GONNA TEAR YOUR HEAD OFF.
[ Men Laughing ]
I REALLY DON'T WANT
MY HEAD TORN OFF.
MIND IF I FINISH
MY LUNCH FIRST ?
I DON'T WANNA INTERRUPT
YOUR SUPPER, DAWES.
WHEN YOU'RE READY,
I'LL BE IN THE BACK ROOM
SHOOTIN' POOL.
DAMN, HE'S GOT A GRIP.
THEY CALL HIM THE POLISH ANGEL.
DID YOU SEE THE ARMS ON HIM ?
THAT DON'T MEAN A DAMN THING,
DOES IT, J.D. ?
IT'S WHAT'S UP HERE THAT COUNTS.
[ Man Over Radio ]
I CHANGED MY MIND.
HE WAS A DOWN-AND-OUT.
THE CLOTHES HE WORE
WERE NEARLY RAGS.
HE LOOKED AS THOUGH
HE HADN'T SHAVED IN WEEKS,
AND THERE WAS A SMELL
OF ALCOHOL ON HIS BREATH.
[ Radio Stations Changing ]
[ Grunts ]
THAT WAS PRETTY CLOSE.
YEAH.
IT JUST HAD TO BE.
YOU GOT TO DETOUR.
WHAT FOR ?
WE GOT A BAD ACCIDENT UP AHEAD.
YOU HAVE TO GO AROUND.
OVER HERE.
THAT LOOKS LIKE
A PRETTY BAD ROAD.
YOU THINK I CAN MAKE IT ?
WELL, I GUESS
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO,
UNLESS YOU WANNA GO BACK.
OKAY.  THANKS.

[ Man ]
HOW ABOUT ANOTHER SHOT

DON'T LET 'EM
RATTLE YOU, HONEY.
I'M MAKIN' SO MANY MISTAKES.
AW, TRUCKERS ARE PUSSYCATS.
THEY GET RATTLED,
YOU JUST SHOW 'EM
THEM SAD EYES OF YOURS,
AND THEY'LL BE
SO ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES
THEY'LL TIP YOU DOUBLE.
WAIT.
WHAT KIND OF ODDS
ARE YOU GIVIN' ME ?
ODDS ?  KISS MY ASS.
THIS AIN'T NO RACETRACK.
I DON'T THINK
THEY LIKE ME.
[ Man ]
COME ON WITH THAT COFFEE !
SIT ON IT, EARL !
HOW MANY CUPS OF COFFEE
DO YOU WANT FOR YOUR QUARTER ?
THE ONLY THING
TRUCKERS ARE INTERESTED IN...
IS HOW FAST THEIR TRUCKS'LL GO
AND HOW FAR
THEIR C.B.s'll REACH.
AND YOUR ASS AND MY ASS.
[ Men Cheering, Shouting ]
WHERE ARE THEY TAKIN'
MY RIG ?

IMPOUND ?

[ Footsteps Approaching ]
STAND UP, BOY.
THE MUNICIPAL COURT

THE HONORABLE
JUDGE JOSHUA G. TRIMMINGS
IS PRESIDING.
[ Insect Buzzing ]
OFFICER BOLES.
[ Trimmings ]
ARE YOU MR. DAWES ?
YES, SIR.
MR. DAWES, YOU'RE
CHARGED WITH SPEEDING,
[ Clears Throat ]
FAILURE TO POST
A SHIPPER'S NAME
IN THE PROPER PLACE,
FAILURE TO KEEP A LOG,
DRIVING AN OVERWEIGHT TRUCK...
AND, UH, RESISTING ARREST.
HOW DO YOU PLEAD ?
LOOK, YOUR-YOUR HONOR,
THIS IS ALL A PACK OF LIES.
I WAS JUST DRIVING DOWN
HIGHWAY 120, AND THIS GUY
PULLS OUT IN FRONT OF ME.
I ALMOST JACKKNIFED MY RIG,
AND HE TELLS ME I HAVE TO
TAKE THIS ROAD INTO YOUR TOWN--
-[ Strode ]  ANSWER THE JUDGE !

HE HAD A GOOD THREE INCHES !
HE WAS TRYING
TO HYPNOTIZE ME !
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.
THAT'S A LOT OF CRAP !
[ Pearl ]
WATCH OUT, J.D. !
DON'T EVER GET ME IN A SITUATION
LIKE THAT AGAIN, ELROY.
COME ON, BURTON.
I NEED A RIDE.
THIS ISN'T A TOWN !
IT'S A RACKET !
MR. DAWES,
WE HAVE A FINE COMMUNITY HERE.
IT'S A GROUP OF
HARDWORKING PEOPLE WHO HAVE
A VISION OF THE FUTURE.
HOWEVER,
OUTSIDERS LIKE YOURSELF,
THEY OFTEN MISINTERPRET
WHAT THEY SEE.
THEY'RE SOMETIMES EVEN CRITICAL
OF WHAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WE WORK TOGETHER HERE
FOR THE COMMON GOOD,
AND IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT
MY SCHEDULE DOES NOT GIVE ME...
THE TIME TO TAKE YOU BY THE HAND
AND LEAD YOU AMONG US--
TO EXPOSE YOU TO OUR MANY
INDUSTRIES AND ENTERPRISES.
[ Chuckling ]
NO, NO, I FIND YOU WITHOUT
A TRACE OF CONTRITION.
YOU'RE INSULTING
TO THIS COURT, MR. DAWES,
AND YOU'RE INSULTING TO
THE POLICE OFFICERS
ATTENDANT HERE.
IT IS THE JUDGMENT
OF THIS COURT THAT
YOU ARE GUILTY AS CHARGED.
- WAIT A MINUTE !
- $250 OR 250 DAYS !
YOU GUYS ARE CRAZY !
PLEASE, PAY THE FINE.
YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS.

[ J.D. ]
MEDITATION IS ESSENTIAL
TO THE MARTIAL ARTS TRAINING.
IT IS IMPERATIVE
THAT YOU DEVELOP YOURSELF,
NOT ONLY PHYSICALLY BUT MENTALLY
AND SPIRITUALLY AS WELL.
TO MEDITATE,
YOU MUST CONCENTRATE
ON WHAT WE CALL THE "THIRD EYE,"
THE CENTER BEGINNING
RIGHT HERE.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
AS YOU'RE FOCUSING,
YOU'LL NOTICE...
THAT IT WILL BECOME
BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER.
YOUR TOTAL CONCENTRATION
IS ON THE THIRD EYE.
[ Telephone Ringing ]
HELLO.
[ Burton ]
CHECKED WITH THE HIGHWAY PATROL.
THERE'S NO RECORD
OF ANY ACCIDENT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
I TALKED TO THE SCALE MASTER
AT SALINAS STATION.
BILLY DIDN'T SHOW UP.
HE MUST'VE TAKEN A SIDE ROAD
OVER TO HIGHWAY 5.
PROBABLY 120.
UH-OH.
WHAT ?
TEXAS CITY,
THEY WORK THE SIDE ROADS.
IF YOU GO OVER THERE,
YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL.
THEY GOT THEIR OWN KIND OF LAWS,
AND THEN THERE'S STRODE.
HE WORKS THE FRONT,
AND A GOON NAMED BOLES
WORKS THE BACK.
THANKS, BURTON.
RIGHT.
I'LL HANDLE IT.
GOOD LUCK.
THANKS.

WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
I WANT TO LODGE
A COMPLAINT.
A COMPLAINT.
AH, A COMPLAINT.

[ Speaking Latin ]
THE GREATEST COMPLAINT
OF ALL, HMM ?
IT IS THE USUAL FORTUNE
OF COMPLAINT...
TO EXCITE CONTEMPT
MORE THAN PITY.

YOU CALL THAT REBUILT ?
LET'S SEE, WITH TAX,

FOR THAT PRICE,
I COULD BUY A NEW ONE.
HELP YOURSELF, MISTER.
THERE'S A BIG WORLD OUT THERE.
MY VAN'S AT THE GAS STATION.
SAY, UH, I--
BY THE WAY,
YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO SEE...
A BLUE AND WHITE KW
IN TOWN YESTERDAY, DID YOU ?
NOPE, CAN'T SAY I DID.
DID YOU LOSE ONE ?
HEY, DON'T FORGET
YOUR RADIATOR.
FOR THAT PRICE, DELIVER IT.
HEY, I'M A BUSY MAN.
I GOT A 'DOZER TO FIX,
COMPRESSOR TO REPAIR.

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ?
THE PRICES ARE HIGHER

THIS WOULDN'T BE
A TRIMMINGS ENTERPRISE,
WOULD IT ?
I'LL HAVE A DOUGHNUT.
DO THEY CHARGE EXTRA
FOR THE CREAM ?
THAT'S ONE
THEY NEVER THOUGHT OF.
YOU BETTER WATCH
YOUR STEP, ARLENE.
THANK YOU.
CAN I USE YOUR PHONE ?
YEAH, SURE, IT'S BACK--

THAT'S A GODDAMN LIE.
HOWARD PUT EVERY DOLLAR
HE HAD INTO THIS PLACE.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE ONLY
MONEY YOUR DADDY EVER HAD
WAS THE MONEY I LOANED HIM.
- I GOT PAPERS TO PROVE THAT.
- HOWARD WOULDN'T BORROW
ANY MONEY FROM YOU.
HE KNEW YOU TOO WELL
FOR THAT.
- THAT IS THE VILEST THING
THAT ANYBODY EVER SAID TO ME.
- I CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT.
- YOUR DADDY AND I HAD A LOVE--
- HE HATED YOUR GUTS !
HE TURNED THAT HATE
ON HIMSELF.
AND BECAUSE OF YOU, HE'S DEAD.
YOU DESTROYED HIM BECAUSE
YOU COULDN'T CORRUPT HIM !
YOU AND YOUR
INCESSANT COMPLAINTS
AND YOUR CONSTANT DEMANDS...
CAUSED HIM
TO LEAVE THIS HOUSE.

Our story starts right -
- here...
Legion! Legion!
French foreign legion!
Legion! Legion!
French foreign legion!
Legion! Legion!
French foreign legion!
Legion! Legion!
French foreign legion!
We'll give all off - for France...!
We'll break our balls - for France...!
We're scum and we're *** but we'll gladly die, we'd loose all our legs or at least an eye,
...with great panache - for France!
...and a little in cash...
...cash, cash, cash, cash, cash, cash...
We're all for one - for France...!
To die as one - for France...!
We'll torture and maim, we will kill and be killed,
...for glory and fame we are really thrilled...
...we're shoving the schmucks
- for France...!
...and a couple of bucks...
...bucks, bucks, bucks, bucks, bucks, bucks...
So bring on the Arabs, with sabers and knives,
...we'll murder the men, and we'll rape all their wives,
...for Liberty! Freedom!
Nobility! Money!
...and then...
...perhaps for a change, we'll murder the wives...
...and rape all the men...!
...for France...! For France...!
For France!
This story appears to start here in the Sahara Desert - but it really started some years earlier - in England
Geste Manor
At last!
At last, Crumble!
A son! A boy to carry on the family name of Geste.
Geste...
- He shall be a leader of men.
- Men...
- I shall call him "Beau".
- Beau...
- Yes.
- Yes...
- Beau.
- Beau yes...
My boy Beau will be tall and strong as a tree...
...I know.
- How did that sound to you?
- It sounded like "bye bye, Beau..."
Any news?
Has my son arrived yet...?
Not yet, but the doctor said any minute.
- Damn blast my sow of a wife, God bless her...
- ...and all who sail in her.
How long does she intend to keep me waiting?
He's arrived, Sir!
Listen to him crying!
Cowardly little swine.
Is that what he thinks a hero is like?
Bawling like a sissy?
I'll beat some courage into him!
Where are you going Sir?
Out of my way, doctor Crippen!
I want to discipline my son!
- Ahaaa! Before you go in...
...I must tell you...
...I bear both good tidings and bad tidings.
First...
...your wife is dead.
- And the bad tidings...?
Your son...
...is...
...a daughter!
A daughter ?!
I have no requirements for a daughter!
You incompetent fool,
I gave you precise instructions!
I want a boy!
BOYS
ORPHANAGE
ADOPTIONS ARRANGED
TO SUIT ALL POCKETS
You could not have picked a better establishment, Sir Hector.
All my dear boys here, blessed, they practice what I preach. brotherly love, self denial, and *** onto others.
They don't *** each onto other,
Sir Hector.
You cannot stop the pretty dears.
Now then, Sir Hector, what kind of a boy was you looking for?
We have all manner here, you know; high and low degree.
Will you stop that, you vicious little varmint?!
Now this is a scruffy lot...
...won't do, won't do, won't do...
...and he looks jewish!
I want a soldier, not a dentist!
To be frank with you,
Miss Wormwood,
...I'm looking for something...
...a little more stylish.
You see, my son has to be a hero.
For the right boy I'm prepared to pay handsomly,...
...he's got to be tall,
...blond, must have an aristocratic bearing,
...and the necessary blue eyes,
...a lad to whom I can confidently bequeath my own noble features.
I shall eventually need him to reach a height of six feet one,
And naturally he will be brought up...
...with an english gentleman's attitude and love of slaughter.
That seems to cover the essentials.
Why, you're wheezing, Woodward!
Let's proceed slowly.
That's him.
That's Beau.
Beau Geste!
You are Beau Geste.
No Sir, my name is Obediah Spittle.
No...
You were Obediah Spittle.
But now...
...you are...
...Beau Geste!
I am Beau Geste.
- Wrap him up.
- Oh, I couldn't, Sir Hector!
He's like my own son!
- I give you five guineas.
- My own son sold for six!
Tell you what I'll do: make it twelve, and I'll throw in his identical twin brother.
Two sons? Two heroes?
I'll take them both.
Digby!
Say hello to your new papa...
I can't split the pair...!
And so began a new life for us.
Together with Sir Hector's daughter,
Isabel, we became Gestes;
The days flew quickly by...
We were identical twins.
But somehow, Beau was much more identical then me.
Isabel adored Beau.
He seemed to feel nothing; but then, heroes aren't allowed feelings.
It was as if I felt his feelings for him.
Beau's destiny was never in doubt.
He wanted a noble death, and a Viking's funeral.
That's the way I'd like to go, Dig.
Dig, will you set fire to me, and bury me at sea...?
Well... alright.
But not until you're dead!
- Beau, you won't go and die before me?
- Of course not, Dig.
We're inseparable, aren't we?
Geste et Geste nil separatum est.
Rear march!
Right turn!
Rear march!
Beau was tought to be a soldier.
He learned to give commands.
And, as for me, well...
...I learned to obey them.
Our life at Geste Manor concluded as usual.
...Until that fateful night, when Sir Hector announced...
Beau!
Isabel!
I have wonderful news!
England has been plunged headlong into a bloody and disastrous war!
- My regiment leaves at dawn.
- Where is this war, Sir?
How the hell should I know?
My vallet has the orders.
The piles of rotting corpses, the stench of blood...
How it titillates these jaded nostrils!
I suppose I'm just an old fashioned sentimentalist...
Beau, come with me, I want you to watch what I'm doing very carefully.
Excuse me, Your Majesty.
One day, you'll have to do this yourself.
Twenty-nine on right boob...
...and three twiddles on the left.
This is the legendary
"Blue Water" sapphire of the Gestes.
I have seen the Hope diamond...
...I have feasted my eyes upon the Koh-I-Noor...
Compared to this perfection, they are pieces of shit.
Beau, this priceless gem is the foundation of the Geste fortune.
Guard it until I return.
Beau grew into the full stature of his manhood.
I got older.
Sunday!
Day of rest.
And what of the lovely Isabel?
She practiced and practiced, and became an accomplished virgin.
Always so damn timid, Dig.
Really come at me, eh?
Beau couldn't help being a hero,
Nature cast him for the part.
Physically he was perfect.
As his identical twin,
I must have been perfect too.
Only, it didn't show so much on me...
Are you all right, old sport?
I think so, yes.
Stop it, stop it! I think I discovered another movie cliché!
What does it say?
Sudan relieved!
One hundred thousand english lives lost!
Forty-five thousand
French die!
England wins by fifty-five thousand! Hooray!
Drive on!
Look! It's the coach!
The Young Master is home!
- Isabel!
- Oh, father!
Digby...
- Beau!
- Father!
Children, I have a surprise, a very pleasant one  for you.
I want you to meet lady Flavia Geste...
...your new mother!
We got married this morning.
Maman...
...of course this will have to go.
Yes, I must refurbish this entire house...
...from top to bottom.
I mean it's awful. Just awful.
And that monstrosity over there...
That's great uncle Fabius!
And that... thing over the fireplace!
Well, it simply must come down!
- But mother, that's the Geste coat of arms! - How quaint...
No-no-no... down it comes. I want to do something amusing with a peach...
As you say, my dear...
But isn't it time for bed?
- But it's only six o'clock!
- Oh, is it? Dammit.
Now, the dining room.
...come, come, Isabel; write all this down...!
Magnificent, isn't she?
Almost makes me feel seventy-five again.
She's certainly not unattractive, Sir.
I met her in Paris, embassy reception...
...she just lost her seventh husband.
- Lost or mislaid?
And I want something absolutely wicked with wall-to-wall hermine...
Don't you think we should look at the bedroom...?
Yes! I thought we might do something bizarre, with a chandelier and some ostrich feathers...
I hope I have the energy...
Tell Crumble I may require a step-ladder...
One moment, Sir...!
May I have a moment with our...
...our new mama?
Of course... get caught upstairs, eggy-pops.
Quite right, give me a head-start... we should rise together!
- May I talk to you... confidentially?
- What's a mother for...?
Be careful with father; he's a very old man.
And I want him to become a very, very old man.
I trust we shan't be... enemies, Beau?
That's up to you,
I should say.
Good night, Beau...
Good night.
Mother.
Hurry up! I can't hang on to this chandelier much longer...!
Something terrible has happened in the manor!
Come on, doggie!
I've given him a sedative.
But it's touch and go.
- Heart attack? - Yes. It was too much for a man of his age...
He over-came himself...
This may be the first recorded case of... death by extasy...
Will he pull throuh?
He's a tough old warhorse...
...but frankly, it's a matter of time.
Simply a matter of time.
Oh, how sad. Taken from his loved ones in his very blime...
You must be brave, mama, you mustn't cry...!
You're right.
Fear not, dear Hector!
Your beloved Flavia will sing and dance again!
But he's not dead yet!
Well, it's been four days, for Christ's sake!
The doctor said three at most!
Incompetent quack...
You might at least allow him to pass away in dignity...
Of course I shall sell this house...
It holds too many unhappy memories for me...
Isabel, you're a virgin.
You can enter a nunnery.
Obiously, so can you, Digby.
But...
I have other plans for you, Beau.
My lady, the gentlemens from Cartier's are here.
- Crumble, the safe.
- The safe, Crumble...
Cartier's, the jewellers?
Surely you don't mean to sell the "Blue Water"...?
It's mine now, and I shall dipose of it as I see fit.
Here it is, my lady.
- What happened?
- Probably just a power failure, mother.
- Look!
- What?
- There!
- Where?
- Here!
- Where?
- Gone!
- What?
- It!
Is this someone's idea of a joke?
- Don't look at me.
- I didn't take it.
Not faithful old Crumble.
Very well. I'm going to put out this light, count to three, and put the light back on.
But then I want to see the
"Blue Water" back on the table.
One... two... three.
I'm going to try again.
This time, I want to see the
"Blue Water" back in it's place.
Also, the table.
One, two, three.
My patience is wearing thin.
I shall try once more.
One - two - three.
I knew you would come to your senses.
Crumble, the police.
Stop!
If you call the police, it will only bring shame upon the name of Geste.
Screw the name of Geste!
Well, what do you suggest?
I would give the culprit until morning to think it over.
- And? Will he think it over, Beau?
- I guarantee it.
You have my word as a Geste that you will not find that box empty in the morning.
So, it was you!
N-no, I've just crept down here to see if the stone had been returned...
- And has it?
All I found was this... envelope.
It's in Beau's handwriting.
I shall be far, far away by the time you here this letter...
Yes Dig, it was I that took the "Blue Water"
Sometime a man has to do what a man has to do.
Look after Isabel, and guard her virginity as you would your own.
I trust papa will continue to die nobly...
Adieu, brother!
Wait a minute,
I haven't finished yet!
Thank you.
P.S.: Don't look for me.
Especially in North Africa.
- What are you doing...?
- I'm destroying the evidence.
Good idea.
No.
I shall eat it raw.
The evidence wil be safely in my stomach.
By the time it comes out in the end,
Beau will be in North Africa.
- I shall confess.
- Will they believe you did it?
I shall just stand up there in court...
...and say...
Guilty my lad.
Have you nothing to say in your defense?
Nothing.
Not a word.
I refuse to speak.
I shall remain silent...
...until death as befits a Geste...!
- SHUT UP!
I will not divulge a single secret, not one...
SHUT UP!!!
Digby Geste!
I hereby sentence you to two years hard labor.
Doesn't seem very much, does it?
Couldn't I give him more?
Did I hear four...?
Four years.
Four years!
Five years.
Six!
Eight years!
Ten.
- Twelve!
- What are they saying?
Going... going...
Fifty years!
Fifty years!
Seventy five years!
NINE HUNDRED
AND FIFTY SIX YEARS!
Prisoner at the bar,
I hereby sentence you to nine hundred and fifty six years!
...or life.
Whichever is the longer.
Take him away!
Oh Digby!
Don't worry about me.
Beau's secret will be safe in my hands.
- How's father?
- Still alive and dying...
Good.
Then I have done whatever it is that I have done...
...for Beau and for the sacred name of Geste...!
Somewhere in Morocco...
Company, halt!
About face!
Stand still!
Don't move a muscle!
Or you'll be flogged!
New recruits ready for inspection, sergeant Markov!
My name is Markov.
Sergeant Markov.
And I despise you all.
And I don't even know you yet, gentlemen.
Komm, mein pferdchen... hopp, hopp, eins, zwei...
In time, my contempt for you will blossom into revolsion and digust.
If you are lucky!
What have we here, Boldini?
A shipment of new recruits, oh my sergeant!
Ja... look at them, corporal...
Oh, God...
A much redder bunch than we usually get them...
- Your name?
- Smith...
- Name?
- Schmidt...
- Your name?
- Smith... Smith...
Take their numbers, Boldini...
We ask no questions here...
...darn that sock...!
Perhaps he will be good in the kitchen, huh?
- Your name?
- Jones!
- Jones?
It used to be Smith.
I had to change it.
Officer material...!
- Your name?
- Smith. Reporting for duty, sergeant Markov.
"Smith. Reporting for duty, sergeant..."
Why do you speak in this damn silly way?
It's my usual manner of speach sergeant, I'm sorry if it offends you.
Listen, YOU offend me.
It's your boots I want to see my face in...
...not your fingernails!!!
You're in the legion now, here we don't need gentlemen.
Oh, good morning général Pecheur... comment ca va, mon général...?
I'm a soldier sergeant, and I trust
I shall prove a loyal and a brave one!
- What don't we like in the legion, Baldini...?
- A smartass...
This one, my sergeant,
Boldini would like to...
Not now, not now...
Your time will come, later.
Now... For all you other Smiths, my little fledermauses:
You are now in the legion.
You will be soldiers!
And you will learn how to die!
Life is as brief as a butterfly's fart.
But death is something that you have forever!
From now on, you will march until you drop, and when you have dropped, you will crawl...!
Some may consider that I am excessively cruel.
But, there is a reason for this cruelty.
I enjoy it!
- Good night, scum.
- Good night, sarge!
Good night, sergeant!
Good night, me darling Catherine...!
Good night...
...whoever you are...!
"The view from my window"
Dear Dig, I'm sorry a haven't written before, but in the legion it's all go...
...busy busy busy, don't you know.
Weather's spiffy.
Bags of sunshine!
Highs in the upper hundred and thirties.
The chap here in charge is OK for a kraut, but not one of us.
Lots to do and see... Haven't had a quiet moment until now...
Food - not so hot.
Having no ladies makes some of the men a trifle edgy...
Some of the chaps are a bit on the... irritable side.
Heard you're in jail for life!
Ah, jeez! Still, knowing you, you'll find someone to cheer up with.
- How's the lovely Isabel?
- Okay!
And of course, Sir Hector.
How is he?
Still alive and dying, thank you for asking!
Perhaps one day you'll be able to get out here and join me!
Until then, ever thine, your twin, Beau.
I shall escape....
I shall escape!
- Up or down?
- Yes, please.
I'm sorry about all this, but next week we're having it wallpapered.
Oh I see lady Flavia,
I forgot to tell you...
Your son is in solitary confinement.
Who are all these other people, Governor?
They are also in solitary confinement; crowded jail conditions, you know.
Digby!
Digby!
I must talk to you confidentially.
- WHAT?
- I know you don't have the "Blue Water"
I know that Beau has it, hasn't he?
I refuse to talk. I won't talk.
Not a word! Not a syllable!
Shut up!
I can't hear myself moaning!
- I'm sorry...
- If you won't talk,
I'll find some other way of getting it out of you!
I shall escape.
I shall escape and join Beau!
Delighted you came, my dear!
And I'd like you to know that you made a happy man feel very... old.
Oh, thank you.
Now let's get this straight -
In exchange for one hour of amorous sedaliance...
Just under four minutes, actually...
Really?
Well, one does what one can...
...you wish me to contrive an escape from my own prison?
Precisely.
To pit the entire weight of british justice...
... against...
Point taken...
Thank you. It's been a business doing pleasure with you.
Oh, how power corrupts...
...thank God...
Oh, one thing. Digby lacks experience. He needs assistance.
Don't worry.
We'll give him a helping hand.
...even if we have to force him to escape!
I've escaped.
I have escaped!
Where to, Sir?
Morocco!
I've escaped!
Follow that hansom!
Enjoy your meal, please!
My mother's recipe.
The men are complaining about the food, sergeant Markov!
COMPLAINING?
I don't eat as well as you do!
All alone in the ***'s mess!
We march at the first light.
Our moment of reckoning will come at fort Zindeneuf...
All day yesterday the sheik's men have been attacking the fort.
Many brave legionnaires have been killed in a futile effort to defend it.
Tomorrow, you will be killed doing something equally futile!
You're only privileged to die once.
Don't screw it up!
Digby Smith, reporting for duty, Sir!
Join the other dreck!
- Good heavens! Digby!
- Beau!
- Oh, God, it's good to see you!
- And you too!
Geste et Geste nil separatum est!
What are you doing here?
Where else did you expect me to come when I escaped?
- Escaped?
- Didn't you arrange it?
Never mind. You're here, that's what matters!
Well, come along.
I'll show you to your quarters!
Oh, I can't believe it!
- How's it look?
- Terrific!
Oh, by the way, I trust father is still alive and dying...?
Oh, couldn't be more so.
You know I'd hate for the old boy to pop off without knowing
I've done him proud...
And...
...what of our dear mother...?
Not got the foggiest, old chap.
Don't worry...
I think we've seen the last of her...
Tell me, Pecheur, what manner of man is the sergeant Markov?
Oh, he is... vicious... cruel... sadistic...
Sergeant Markov is a soldier to the skin...
Appears our friend Beau has a brother who's a jailbird...
Perhaps our... fine english gentleman is not all that he is *** up from...
Oh, hurry Boldini...
Komm, little bär!
The usual, oh Masterful One?
- This little piggy went to market...
- Yes? Yes?
- ...this little piggy stayed at home...
- ...stayed at home...?
-... this little piggy had a roastbeef...
- ...roastbeef...!
- ...This little piggy has none...!
- What happened to the other little piggies?
- Who is it?
- Général Pecheur!
I have a visitor for you!
I'm coming, my general!
- My leg, quick!
- Which one?
Boldini, the dress leg!
Coming, my leg!
...my, my general!
I've got the groove my sergeant.
...Just one more screw...
Keep screwing, Boldini!
Faster, Boldini!
Can't you screw any faster than that?
Every thousand miles this thing must be oiled!
I'm coming, General!
I'm coming!
All present and correct, my general!
...my general?
...my general...!
I'll come straight to the point.
- You know my son Beau.
- He's your son?!
Believe me you have a fine boy there madam!
Bullshit! He's a thief.
Stole something belonging to me.
A large paste sapphire. Well...
...if you can return it to me, it'll be worth two-hundred-francs.
More than you earn in five years!
In order to recover the trinket...
...I may have to hurt the boy.
Even to kill him somewhat...
...slightly.
You march to Zindeneuf tomorrow,
I shall meet you there.
By that time
I shall have the trinket.
Then the two hundred francs will be yours...!
- Good night, sergeant Markov!
- Gute nacht, gnädige Frau!
Boldiniiii...!
Yessss... and what's this down here? Look there too!
More of your handiwork, Boldini!
- You heard?
- Boldini heard, my sergeant.
For two hundred francs,
I could buy myself a twenty-two carat solid gold leg!
How many gold legs could you buy with...
...FIFTY MILLION francs, oh my sergeant Markov...?
Fifty million?
That's idle dreams...
Fifty million for a paste trinket...?
Noooo....
For the "Blue Water" sapphire!
Aaah, for the Blue...
Adieu, adieu... mes braves... mes petits soldats...
May God go with you...!
...I have better things to do.
Forgive the interrupcion, ma petite...
...where were we...?
At page thirty-six, third diagram from the bottom...!
Oooh...
...c'est difficile...!
I wonder how they do that...!
Ohhohoo... c'est formidable...
Pardon, mon empereur, but this is not even for your eyes...!
Arabs!
Battlestations!
Kriegsmanöver!
Fire!
Good shot, Dig!
Wind compensation - zwei und zwanzig degrees, true North!
...zwei und zwanzig degrees, true North...!
Und - feuer!
Scheissmerde!
AJAX
CAMEL INFLATOR
Excuse me...
Am I in any sort of danger here?
Digby, look...
Look, they got our flag!
We'll have to get another one!
You take that side,
I'll take this.
Good luck!
Jump it!
We interrupt this important battle to bring you the news...
...the score is twenty-three dead, seven wounded on either side.
We'll be right back to the action, right after this message...
HONEST HAKKIM
OFFERS YOU A GENUINE DEAL
Shalom, Salam, welcome effendis!
I wanna tell you something...
...you want a good set of humps, come to camel-lot...
...come to Hakkim's camel-lot!
I've got here the best deals in town, look at this here -
...this is our customized animal, this is a beauty...
...this one has been just recently de-humped.
Comes with an automatic mouth-wash, you can't miss a deal like this...!
Here we got the bargain of the week, one lady owned camel...
...this camel has never gone anywhere, just stood around looking good...
...come on down, take advantage of me!
This is a beautiful animal.
This happens to be a convertible.
You take off the hump, you put on a couple dots...
...what have you got in the summer, you got a giraffe...
...the kids will love it!
Come on in!
Over here I got a special couture...
This camel is serviced four times a day!
...by that camel.
In fact, I'll put them together, you can be a two camel family!
That's all I'm gonna show you...
...I got the biggest camel-lot in the whole world...
...not to mention the valley.
So you come on down, you take the trail to fez...
...just stop and you make a left turn over at the first sand dune heading east...
...you come on down, bring the kids...
...I'll stand upon my fez until my face is such a mess...
See Hakkim, see Hakkim, see Hakkim...!
And now, back to the battle...!
Digby...!
Looks like we've beaten them off, Beau.
They'll coma again at dawn.
They always do in sthis kind of story.
Now remember...
Save your last bullet for yourself!
Yes, I'd like a souvenir...
Oh, Dig...
If I'm pipped before you are...
...don't forget what we agreed.
- The Viking funeral?
- That's the ticket.
Make sure I'm buried at sea.
Might be a bit tricky out here, but I'll do what I can...
Geste et Geste nil separatum est...
<- BATTLE
I see you haven't done much of this sort of thing, Digby...
How'd you know my name is Digby?
What sort of thing...?
Who are you...?
I think I've seen you...
You're in movies, aren't you?
Older brother takes care of everything.
I promise you.
You're not Beau...
You didn't steal the "Blue Water"...
How do you know about the "Blue Water"...?
The Gestes always stick together.
I keep telling you you're not a Geste!
Digby!
Somebody always gets out of these things.
It might be you.
I bloody well hope it is...!
Look, can you just direct me to the end of this scene, that's all I ask?!
Well, that's very kind of you...
Thank you very much.
Moroccan Gold, eh?
No wonder you always talk so slurred...
Really heavy shit...
Now... where were we?
Let's get some rest...
Yes! Yes.
You have a nice little sleep.
I'll find my own way out...
"MEANWHILE...
IN ANOTHER PART OF THE STORY..."
How do you do!
How too delightful of you to pop in!
Harry brought you tea and crumpets yet?
Thank you, but no.
I have come here on business.
Aaah! But - you must introduce me to your delightful companion!
Lady Flavia Geste...
Oh, goodness, how superb...
Enough of the social graces...
I've been going over the last quarterly return, Sheikh...
The war is losing money.
Two weeks ago I advanced you one million francs, for weapons.
And what have I to show for it?
A lousy three thousand dead legionnaires.
You'll attack Zindeneuf once more.
Only this time...
...I want everyone killed.
We sing as we march, and we march as we sing...
...as we *** with a song on our lips...
We fight as we march, as we march as we fight...
...but we sing as we cash in the chips...
Company, atten-tion!
Present-arms!
Is saluting that man...?
Oh, yes...
All right, my little fledermauses...
Those who survived did quite well.
Those who got killed did rather better...!
So to keep up your morale, there will be a little celebration tonight!
A regimental ball...!
You will enjoy yourself...
That's an order!
Meanwhile I hear that the "Blue Wa..."
You can't be too careful...
...sooo, the "Blue Water" has come back to us again.
Yeah, that's nice...
I have reason to believe... it is secreted about his person.
It's not in his pockets...
...I picked them...
In that case, you'll have to pick his person...
I was looking for the soap...
I have searched his person...
...the "Blue Water" is not there...!
Boldini suspects it must be somewhere else...
...but where is somewhere else...?!?
His private quarters...
I'm not touching those again!
Mother certainly gets around a bit, doesn't she...?
Aaah, sergeant!
How delightful to see you again!
I believe you have a little trinket for me...?
Welcome to Fort Zindeneuf, gnädige Frau...!
...not yet, tonight it'll be in my hands...
...If you will do me the honor of partenaire-ing me...?
Certainly...
Protocol demands I dance my first waltz with sergeant Markov...
Aaah, there you are...
No-one has asked me to dance...
...and I'm tired of being a wall-flower...
Aren't you going to dance with your mother...?
With pleasure...
You're behaving very foolishly...
...I know you have the "Blue Water".
We both could live very well...
I could dance like this all night...
When I leave you tonight, I'm going to take two things with me.
The "Blue Water"...
...and you.
What hour...?
All right gentlemen, synchronize your hourglasses.
We leave in exactly seventy...
...thousand grains of sand...!
Twenty five minutes, and then we must leave, Merdmanger.
But how can you speak of leaving, mon général, when you are having such a wonderful time...?
- Did the earth move for you, darling?
- I did feel... something.
I only hope I lived up to what a mother should expect from her son.
You performed heroicly.
Oh, you know, I haven't got it with me... the "Blue Water".
Beau, let's go away together now...
Oh no...
No, we must go back to the fort.
But I don't want to be there when they attack at dawn!
Hmmm?
At dawn...?
A...attack at dawn...?
...well, who...?
...how do you know they will attack at dawn...?
See I break like the wind...!
- All right! Give me my leg!
- The battle leg...?
Of course the battle leg!
What's the bugle sounding for, if it's not the battle leg...?
Come quick...
It's an anti-clockwise thread here...
...never mind the pain...!
Nobody falls?
Why doesn't anyone fall?
Nobody...?
What kind of a war is this...?
Open the gates!
Hold your fire!
Cease firing!
Hold it!
What the hell do you think you're doing?!?
- Go on firing, all of you!
- Ignore him!
I suppose you know - the penalty for mutiny is total death!
Please lady, out of the way, this is a military matter!
Please, will you?
What are you trying to prove?!?
Why don't you fall???
Because they're blanks!
- Blanks?
- Yes!
Thanks to general Pecheur you've all been issued with blank ammunition!
Even without ammunition!
...angreifen!
Für Vaterland und Kaiser!
Yes...?
Trickt!
We're behind you Sir! We'll die to the last man if you say so!
No!
You can be free!
Go! Deserts!
Get out of here!
Go and be rotten to people! But - do it for our decent living ways!
Excuse me, but we've been riding round and round shooting and whooping like mad things...
Have we called at an inconvenient moment?
Would you like us to come back later...?
No, it's not that, it's just that...  hey...
...fellows...
...you can't just desert!
You'll miss the rest of the story!
Hey...!
Come back...!
You're supposed to be inside, we're supposed to be outside...
Pull down the flag!
Wait for me, wait for me...!
I'm your leader...!
How can I lead if you won't wait for me...?
Oh, I am lost...
And out of the job...
I'm a natural leader of men, but, they won't follow me!
Where...?
Perhaps I can learn...?
By the way...
...where is the "Blue Water"...?
You took the words right out of my mouth...
...which is somewhat...
...un-hygienic...?
Trickt!
Why are you always in the way, Boldini...?
So...
The obligatory duel to the death?
Of course.
As hero and villain, it is expected of us.
We may not quarrel with our given destinies, my friend!
You desire to duel with or without conversation...?
With, I think!
Yes!
Definitely with!
*** twisted and tellingly turned...
...but beware...
...he who turns on his own twist, may yet twist on his own turn!
Cunningly quoted!
But as the *** bends with the wind, so may he shortly be blown like the chaff into the infinite cavity of oblivion!
- I'm not quite sure I understand that...
- Never mind, it sounds good...!
But I do beg your pardon, you were about to say...?
You display a perilous panache, my friend...
*** shriveling to ash, but even as cold steel may be beaten on the anvil, so may it *** be humbled by the hammer of...
...surprize...!
...Tricked again...!
As Von Clausewitz once said:
Mere idle mortals may have feet of clay...
...but mortal idols sometimes have feet of... STEEL!
Don't move, please...!
You moved!
Oh, no! No...!
Tell me, Geste...
...before you kill me...
...where is the "Blue Water"...?
Where is the "Blue Water",
Geste ?!?
Touché, I believe...
I hid it there while we were still in the garrison.
The "Blue Water..."
...it's the last place
I would have looked.
Sooo... Boldini!
Plan fourty-two!
Help me up...!
Look, Boldini, for you and me!
For me...!
Threaten them, Boldini!
Threaten them!
Remember - nerves of steel!
Catch the rope!
Ah yes, good!
Everything is going according to plan!
No, no, Digby!
The "Blue Water"...!
The Geste family fortune...!
You can't just let them take it like that!
- It's a fake...!
- What do you mean a fake...?
Now you don't think I'd take such a risk with the real "Blue Water"...?!?
Well then... Where is it...?
It's in a safe deposit box in Paris...
I'm proud of you, Beau... I am...
I see, we just take the "Blue Water" now and...
...take it straight back to Sir Hector!
Screw Sir Hector!
All my life I've done everything Sir Hector wanted!
I've never done a thing for myself!
...'till now!
- Beau, you can't mean it!
You've saved the fort!
You'll get a medal! You're a hero!
- ...I'll bury you at see!
- Heroism? Medals...?
Medals are like hemorrhoids, Digby, sooner or later every asshole gets one.
What about me?
All my life I've worked for you!
I've gone to jail for you!
I've even felt your feelings for you!
I'm not gonna let you not be a hero!
I'm awfully sorry about this, Digby...
What are you doing...?
They always made a hero of the last men alive...
...and, that's just what he wanted!
Now, there's just one more thing we must do...
Well, if you're quick, but... wouldn't it be more romantic to go to...
Oh no, not that...
Not now...
No, first we must get rid of Beau Geste...
Strange...
A besieged fort...
No signs of a battle...
Ah, no, no, one corpse...
Now, we just have time to scale down the back wall...
Good bye, Digby, old twin...!
And farewell, Beau Geste!
May you rest in peace!
Another hero for France!
Commanding to report...
...to me immediately!
I wish to decorate him!
What's this one for...?
- For baking chocolate mousse...
- Yes... that's good enough.
Adieu, mon brave
Digby Geste reporting for duty, Sir!
This man can tell us the mistery of the deserted fort...!
Yes...
Yes, he could, couldn't he?
Do you intend to talk, my friend?
A Geste never talks!
I refuse to speak!
Not one word!
Not one syllable!
I shall remain silent, totally silent, absolutely silent; I will not utter one...
- Will you shut up?!? - I'm afraid
I can't answer that question, Sir!
Well... then you leave me no option...
...but to shoot you for withholding information.
- If it be so then... so be it.
- It is so.
- Then, so it be.
- Be!
- Sir, look! I found this!
We are loking at the finest soldier I've ever met...
...Beau Geste!
Beau, dead...?
- It's not... It's not possible.
- Formidable!
- Oh, pardon, mon général...
- Merdemanger...
...will you kindly scrape monsieur Geste from my face...?
And place him in a suitable container!
Now... have you any final request, before you are sent to the firing squad?
Well... Beau always wanted a Viking funeral, Sir!
I promised him that he should be buried at sea!
In the middle of the desert...?
C'est drole... However...
The legion always honors it's heroes!
Beau Geste!
Noble son of the legion!
We commend thy mortal remains onto the mighty deep...
It is not the Atlantic...
...but it is the best we can do!
Good bye, Beau Geste!
Go with God!
Now, are you prepared to die?
- I'm prepared!
- Ready...
...ready...
I'm prepared to die, so that Beau's name may live!
Would you expect me to betray my brother...? My country? My Isabel?
Silence onto death is our family motto. Shall I talk now?
Bah! You expect me to talk when all I could preserve is my own measly, worthless life?
Haha!
Doh! Bloody right I'll talk!
I'll talk! I'll talk! I'll talk!
Just try to stop me!
I'll talk! I'll talk!
THREE MONTHS LATER
The Young Master is home!
He's home again!
- My God, this thing is heavy... -
Digby...!
- At last, you've returned!
- Yes!
- Have you...?
- Shhh!
Don't speak! Just let me look at you for a moment!
And then I won't speak and you can just look at me for a moment.
- Enough...?
- Enough...!
- Isabel... You know how I've always felt...
- I know...
- But you know that Beau and I...
- I know...
- I think that you know that he and I...
- I know...
- And you know that if we didn't know...
- I know...
- You know I know...
- Yes...
- How little we know...
- I know...
- Then you know that Beau is...
- No...!
- Beau is what...?
- Beau is... not.
- Oh...
- If he were, I would feel it.
Somehow I know that... even if he and Flavia managed to escape...
...they've never made their way through that parched desert...!
Oh, darling...
If I should die now, I'd die happy...
Oh, mother...
If it weren't for the thirst...
...this damn thirst...
- Waiter! Oh, waiter!
- Yes, Sir?
- Champagne please.
Extremely well iced!
- coming up, Sir!
You know, it's strange... I always used to know what Beau was feeling.
And...
...somehow I have the feeling he's still alive.
A man's gotta be what a man's gotta be...
...he must poke his heart right in the eye without flinching to see...
He must be what he must, he must must what he be...
...just to be what he was what he will be because he will be what is he...
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do...
...he must ask himself who am I, when am I, why am I, now that I'm who...
...and what am I when, and when am I what...
...and why am I, who I am, what I am, when I am not...
Though the answer is so easy to guess
He must dare to say, dare to say yes!
Yes!
Now what is a hero, but a man with no choice...
...he needs courage and guts...
...as well as blond hair and a high tenor voice...
He must climb the impossible dream, and then...
...with a lump in his throat he must cry with his last time for courage...
...to reach...
...the impossible not.

Grover, what do you mean coming in here after me when I'm with my friends?
Get outta here. You'll get your supplies tomorrow like everybody else.
- It ain't that. I brought you something.
- Yeah? What?
A piece of tail, cos I owe you a favour, you dig?
A piece of what? Man, what you talking about? Look over there.
I got plenty of tail. I got more tail than I can handle. I even got white tail.
And you telling me you brought me something. What you been shootin'?
It ain't that. This is something special.
This broad is strung out.
Says she'll do anything to get straight, man. Anything.
Then she's yours. You fix her.
Come on, man. Don't be like that.
If I say she's somethin' special, she's somethin' special, man.
At least you can look at her.
She's sittin' in your car.
In my car? You mean you've got some strung-out broad in my car?
Man, I'm gonna kick your ass.
All right, baby. Everybody out.
- You say she'll do anything?
- That's what she said, man.
Ain't she somethin'? Too much for me.
Get in. You drive.
Honey, you're with friends at last.
We're gonna straighten you out for sure.
You know just the words that turn me on.
And I know what you want, too, and you're gonna get it.
Let's go to your place.
You can have the leftovers.
No, man, I just wanna get high and watch.
Hey, ain't one man big enough for you, honey?
Do I look like the kind of girl one man would be enough for?
- One big man.
- One big dealin' man, maybe.
You are that big dealin' man
I been hearin' about, ain't you?
Yeah, maybe. Big enough.
- When you gonna give me some?
- In a little bit. We're almost there.
Anything you want, big man.
Jesus.

Son of a bitch.
You really is a big man, aren't you?
Yeah.
Wait.
You better give it to me first.
Dammit, what the hell are you doing in there? Making a goddamn soufflé?
Just a minute, Sugarman.
First things first, you dig?
Hey, big man.
Why don't you turn out the lights?
This is the end of your rotten life, you motherfuckin' dope pusher.
It was easy for him because he really didn't believe it was comin'.
But it ain't gonna be easy for you.
You better believe it's comin'.
Wait. Wait.
What do you wanna go and do this for? Why?
Look here. I got your fix.
Don't you want your fix?
No. But you do.
I don't get this.
What do you want with me?
My name's Coffin.
LuBelle Coffin is my little sister.
LuBelle?
Shootin' smack at 11, and you got her on it!
Please! Please!
Her whole life is gone.
She can never get it back.
And you're livin' real good.
That ain't right.
- It ain't right, so go on and take the shot.
- I can't. That'd kill me.
Maybe it will, maybe it won't. But if it do, you're gonna fly through the Pearly Gates with the biggest fuckin' smile
St Peter's ever seen.
I don't even remember your little sister. No!
- NURSE: I can't do it, Doctor.
- Christ, now what?
It's her first time in emergency.
Get somebody in here who can handle this job.
Where's Coffin? Get Coffin in here.
- Sorry I'm late, Doctor.
- Where the hell have you been?
Car broke down on the freeway. Just shook me up a little bit. I'll be all right.
Jesus, what's happening here tonight?
This place is turning into a fuckin' insane asylum.
Coffy, get your ass outta here, and don't come back until you're good and ready.
- Now move!
- Yes, Doctor.
All right, let's go.
We don't have all day.
Hi, Doctor.
Another fun-filled Saturday night.
- What can I do for you, McHenry?
- This is my new partner, Carter Brown.
- Carter, Dr Brannan.
- How are you, Doctor?
Hello, young man.
Sergeant said you want information on that junkie OD case we turned up tonight.
Right. Come over to the desk for a minute.
I don't think he's gonna come out of it, because he apparently shot something else besides heroin. Clipboard, please.
I'd like to know if you found any other drugs around the scene.
I'd like to know what to treat him for until we get the analysis.
MCHENRY: No, sorry.
He'll have flushed it down the toilet.
BROWN: Hey, Coffy.
Hey, baby.
Carter.
What's the matter? Somethin' wrong?
No, I'm just a little tired tonight for some reason.
What are you doin' here?
The only cop I know to get a dislocated toe, run over by his own squad car, while writing a ticket cos he didn't set the handbrake.
- Come on. Don't tell stories like that.
- I had to hold your hand while they set it.
- You want some?
- Yeah, black, please.
Boy, we had a real messy one tonight.
A junkie killed his connection with a shotgun.
Blew his head clean off, then OD'd himself.
Yeah? Kind of strange, isn't it?
At least, that's what my partner says.
I don't believe it.
You don't?
There's a mob been takin' over the vice and narcotics rackets.
Even tryin' to pay off the police.
You're really beginning to sound like a cop now, you know it?
I got a busy night, Carter. I gotta go.
Wait a minute. I still wanna see you.
Can't we get together this week?
Come on, Carter. I've told you how it is.
Things haven't changed any.
I can't believe you're still hung up on that phoney politician.
You're not gonna get to me by insulting my friends.
Just give it a chance. Somethin' innocent, like a movie or a drive in the country.
What are you doin' tomorrow?
You won't wanna do what I'm doin' tomorrow.
Yes, I will. Try me.
Some of the kids were on all kinds of pills.
Some are on methadone now.
The youngest is only nine years old.
The worst are the ones that got the contaminated junk.
But you know dealin' junkies. They'll put anything into it to stretch a dollar out of it.
Time to sit up again, LuBelle.
Your sister's come to see you again.
Flower-child.
Hello, LuBelle. Remember me?
Do you remember Carter?
I brought you your favourite candy.
How do you feel today?
Do you feel better? Good.
You look a lot better.
Who combed your hair?
When I got my certificate
I moved up here so I could make more bread to send some home to LuBelle, paying for music lessons and dance classes, so she wouldn't end up hustlin' like my older sister.
But when you got a sister hustlin' and a brother snortin' coke and shootin' up...
Then I found out about a month ago, for the past year all the money's been goin' for junk.
Pills first, then smack.
I told her to stay away from those people.
But some junkie knew she was gettin' money and he started leanin' on her.
Carter...
Wouldn't you wanna kill somebody who'd done a thing like that to your little sister?
- I sure would.
- Then you think it'd be right?
What? To kill some pusher who's only sellin' to get money to buy for himself?
What good would that do, Coffy?
He's only a part of a chain that reaches all the way back to some poor farmer in Turkey or Vietnam.
- What would you do? Kill all of 'em?
- Why not?
Nothing else seems to do any good.
You know who they are.
Everybody knows who they are.
You're a cop.
Why don't you just arrest them?
It's not that simple, Coffy.
The law can't do that.
You bet it can't.
And I know why it can't too.
Because the law is in for a piece of the action.
Not all of us.
Not yet.
Now, look who's here. It's pretty hard for an ordinary cop to compete with.
Carter, you've been real nice up to now.
Don't spoil it.
But we had a real good thing together once. I think there's still somethin' there.
But we were kids then.
Things are different now.
- Good night, Carter.
- Good night, Coffy.
- George, you're here early.
- Good evening, Miss Coffin.
Mr Brunswick said he'd be finished with business early so you can come sooner.
Okay, but give me a few minutes to change.
I'll be right back.
Howard, I think your interest in this place goes a little beyond just sticking your nose into those books once in a while.
Ruben, you know I never mix business with pleasure.
Except in a ratio of three to one.
When I was a cop on the East Side I had the same ratio, only the other way around.
I didn't say how I mixed 'em.
Here comes my best business now.
- Thanks, Floyd,
- Yes, sir.
Hello, baby.
Ruben, this is Ms Coffin.
Coffy, this is Ruben Ramos, our deputy commissioner.
- Commissioner of what?
- Apple stealers, flatfoots.
He's the heat, baby, so don't pull out any pills or joints.
Really? The fuzz? Isn't there a conflict of interest with you two being here together?
Not at all. In fact, the city council and the police have many interests in common.
Careful. There are limits.
Unfortunately. Especially when the interest is so charming and so beautiful.
Don't try any of that Latin machismo charm on her. She's a liberated woman.
But not that liberated.
Let the man have his say.
- Hi. Like to have your picture taken?
- Sure. Why not?
- I look awful.
- You look fine.
Here we go.
Wow.
Well, I gotta go catch me some criminals.
So soon?
You were just getting warmed up.
He's got hippies to beat up.
The day of a public servant is never over.
It has been delightful meeting you.
So long, you lucky dog.
- I'll have to take that, sweetheart.
- Get out of here. What do you want?
Shut up or I'll cut it off. I don't have time to fuck around. Just give me the film.
You oughta be more careful where you point that camera, sweetheart.
Baby, what are we doing in this dump?
You like it? I just bought it.
- You bought this place?
- Part of it, along with some other people.
- I guess I can drink to that.
- I got something better you can drink to.
- Remember that surprise I promised you?
- Yeah. What?
Meet Congressman Brunswick.
Congressman? Are you out of your mind?
No. They're gonna run me for Congress.
Really? Then let me congratulate you,
Congressman.
I ain't never screwed a congressman before.
When you do that, it makes me feel so good.
You make me feel so happy.
I love you, baby.
You're my woman.
I'll say I am. All yours.
My man.
What's the matter, Coffy, baby?
Something's been bothering you.
I've just been thinking about having to go back to work tonight.
That night shift has been making me a little jumpy.
I thought it was cos when a man gets to my age, he can't satisfy them lusty young bitches no more.
COFFY:
Don't start gettin' insecure, Grandpa.
That long goody'll keep on working as long as I'm able to handle it, and you know it too, you old dog, you.
Oops! Ah!
You shouldn't have made me laugh.
BRUNSWICK: That just goes to show
I been savin' it all for you.
COFFY: I guess.
You know, baby,
I'm really due for a few days off.
Maybe a week.
We such a such a good time last year in Hawaii. Could we go back?
I don't think so, baby. I'm gonna be pretty busy with the campaign.
Then let's go up to the cabin.
- It's really nice in the mountains now.
- Okay, baby. Look.
After the election, win or lose, we'll take a couple of weeks off and go to Acapulco.
If you put it that way, baby...
- Hey, beautiful. You in trouble?
- No, I'm all right, thank you.
- I wanna help.
- Hands off. Ain't nothin' shakin'.
- Hold it. Police.
- What do you want?
I'll do the questioning.
You got identification?
Hold it. What's in that pocket?
Get up there.
- What you doin' here?
- My old lady's in the hospital.
There's no loitering in this lot.
I want you to move it. Move it, buddy.
Why, thank you, Officer.
At your service, ma'am.
Carter, what are you doin' here?
- Actually, I was lookin' for you.
- Really? Shit.
Coffy, is there something you wanna talk to somebody about?
Yeah, as a matter of fact. Why don't we go someplace and find a cup of coffee?
I make the greatest cup of coffee on earth.
That is good.
I feel better already.
We did have some good times together.
Remember how you used to make me laugh?
When was the last time I laughed?
Carter, have you done something when you were mad - I mean really mad - that it was like being in a dream?
Like being up in the ceiling looking down on somebody?
- I think I know what you mean.
- The past few days...
Hello?
Hi, Mac.
I thought about it.
I thought about it a lot.
I gotta tell you somethin'. Not only am I not in, but if you go along with it,
I'll find a way to bust you right along with the rest of 'em.
Do you hear me, Mac?
You better be hearin' me good because that's the way it's gonna be.
Ever get the feelin' you talk too much?
What was that all about?
That was me, blowin' my piece of the action.
- What do you mean?
- My partner McHenry's on the take.
- Who's paying off?
- A gangster from Vegas named Vitroni.
Movin' into the black rackets cos the big money now is in narcotics.
Taken over most pimps and dealers already.
- Pimps?
- Yeah, like King George.
He's a big dealer too.
It all goes together.
I've heard of King George.
So if everybody else is for sale, why are you so special?
There's plenty of good cops left.
What we need is more support from the people.
Quick, get in there. Shut the door.
That's him!
Leave him alone!
Stay out of this, bitch.
Let's go.
- What are you doin'? We ain't got time.
- Just a second.
Jesus.
Come on, dammit.
Carter?
COFFY: I'll kill those bastards for this.
I swear I will.
He's not so good, Coffy.
Quite a bit of brain damage.
Down this way.
What are his chances, Doc?
He may be able to go to the bathroom by himself someday.
- Somebody sure worked him over.
- Yeah.
MCHENRY: Yeah, I'd sure like to get my hands on the guys that did this.
What's happenin'? Do you know a lady named Priscilla that lives around here?
Yeah. Back there up the steps.
Priscilla.
- Hello, Priscilla.
- Do I know you from somewhere?
Yeah. I helped sew up your face.
Remember?
Yeah.
The nurse at the hospital.
What do you want with me?
I see you're back on the junk again.
Just a little now and then.
I ain't got a habit any more.
You ain't? You still street hustling for King George?
No. Listen, my old man is coming back any minute.
If she catches you, she'll kick your ass.
Don't get excited. I just wanna ask you a few questions about King George.
Yeah?
Why?
You wanna get in the life?
Maybe.
I ain't seen him.
Not since I met Harriet.
And anyway...
I never was a street hustler.
I was his top call girl and his personal old lady.
Until he cut your face.
Then you weren't so popular any more.
Then he put you back on the street.
Ain't that right?
Yeah. That's because I got mad and I called him a nigger.
- I knew I shouldn't have done that.
- Do you know this fellow Vitroni?
Arturo Vitroni? Sure.
All George's girls know Arturo.
Balling Arturo is like paying your taxes to the government.
What's he like?
You mean what is he like or what does he like?
Both.
Well, he's kind of freaky.
Not too bad.
He likes a girl he thinks is foreign.
Exotic, you know?
I mean, you tell him you are the queen of the giant Kluck-luks from Inner Siberia and he starts dripping in his pants, and the only way he's gonna get it off is to have you crawl around the floor, talk bad to you, spit on you, things like that.
Where does King George find girls that'll do that kind of an act?
Through his pushers. They find strung-out chicks that do anything to get straight.
He has got people all over.
Now, one more thing.
- Where does he keep his supply?
- His sup...
Hey, what are you trying, to get me killed?
Where does he keep it?
You know, don't you? You lived with him.
You get outta here right now.
Go on. Get outta here.
Get out!
So, you wanna play with knives?
You picked the wrong player.
No. Please, look,
I didn't mean nothin'. Please. Ow!
I'll give you a slice to match the one you got from that dope-pushin' pimp unless you say where he keeps the stuff.
No, please. He'll kill me.
All right.
He's got a fireplace.
It's in a box under the ashes.
Harriet! Harriet!
What the hell is going on here?
She busted in here trying to make me.
Get her outta here.
Come on, bitch.
You lousy bitch!
I go away for half an hour for you to turn a trick, and I come back and find you ballin' some nigger bitch. You white tramp!

Yes. Mr George, I presume.
You're the lady from Jamaica who called me.
That I am, man, and I can see that you're not at all disappointed, of course, so I'll come straight to the point, as I like to do.
Bus! Another drink for my friend here.
I presume a champagne cocktail is sufficient?
Good. I assume you've got complete protection from the police, have you?
Course.
Of course, man. I contacted you as soon as I arrived from Kingston.
I'm told you are the very best there is in your business.
Is that right, man?
- I'd say so.
- Good, man.
I don't do no leather work, man.
No whips, ropes, chains, or none of those fetish freaks.
Just plain sex.
But for that I don't mind saying that I am the very best in my business.
We'll just have to see about that, won't we?
Course, man.
These aren't gettin' any better. You're gonna have to stay off your back awhile.
Oh, well.
Hello, Robert?
Hi. This is Jeri.
I got your number from Lois.
You remember Lois.
Well, I'm new in town and I thought you might like to meet me?
What do I do? What do you want?
Yes.
I know all about that.
Lois told me and it turned me on.
Hm?
I have long blonde hair, blue eyes, creamy skin, and I'm very busty,
I guess you could say.
Hm?
I guess so.
What's your address?
Good grief.
Half-hour?
Mm.
Bye.
Jeri, this is for you.
Better get dressed.
- Shit, Helen.
- Come on.
It's only a blow job in his office.
All right.
I'll be back soon and take the rest of the night off.
What the hell's goin' on around here?
Looks like a goddamn pyjama party.
I want you to meet somebody.
This here's... Mystique.
COFFY: Quite an assortment you have here, man. Not too bad, really.
Yeah.
They'll do. Let's go in the other room so we can talk.
Georgie, sweetie. Here I am. Surprise.
You weren't supposed to get back until tonight.
I took the morning flight.
Miami was such a drag.
That old fart - he couldn't do anything.
I mean nothing!
A thousand bucks a day just to show me off to his friends.
So what I need is some real action, honey.
The kind I can only get from my old man.
- Who's this?
- Meg, I want you to meet Mystique.
- Miss Stick? What kind of name is that?
- Jamaican.
She's gonna be a big asset to our organisation.
Why don't you get yourself a cup of coffee while I check her out?
What do you mean?
What's there to check out?
It's business. Go in there and get a cup of coffee.
It's for the big man. The big V.
Someone better turn the fan on.
I think the temperature's rising.
Cindy, love, this one's for you.
No. Not the fat man again.
- I want you to meet Mystique.
- Glad to know you. How are you?
- Good evening, Mr Vitroni.
- Hello, Studs.
Don't look so hostile, Studs.
We're all on the same side now.
You're working for us.
I work for the King.
That's all.
Studs, you need a manicure.
You need a shine.
GEORGE:
I tell you, you will not be sorry.
How d'you do? My name is Vitroni.
COFFY: Yes, Mr Vitroni.
VITRONI: You're Mystique.
Sam. I think Mr Vitroni'd like another drink. Come along.
Why, Mr Vitroni, you don't have a drink.
I'm so sorry, Miss Stick.
Here, let me help you.
My goodness, you really are a mess.
It was just an accident.
Accidents will happen.
- You are a very naughty girl.
- It was an accident.
- It was not an accident.
- Yes, it was.
It was an accident, like she said.
Now, Mr King Dope-Pusher, you're gonna have a few irate customers pretty soon.
Sugar instead of smack.
Meg. You don't have any salad.
Look!
- Let them go.
- They're out of their goddamn minds.
They're so violent.
COFFY: I'll kill you.
VITRONI: Look at that. Watch her go!
Mr Vitroni, I gotta talk to you.
She's a wild animal.
I've got to have that girl, George. Tonight.

Come. Let's get acquainted.
I'm told that you are a dangerous man, Arturo.
I like that.
It excites me.
And I can see that I'm having a good effect on you also.
My love.
Are you sure you're not just a little black, Arturo?
You're amazing.
Let's go into the other room.
We'll be more comfortable.
Yes. Let's go.
Get down on the floor where you belong, you no-good, dirty, nigger bitch.
Please. I know I'm not good enough for you.
But let me have your precious white body just once.
Then let me see you crawl over here, you black trash.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Come on. Crawl over here.
Crawl, nigger.
You want me to crawl, white motherfucker?
What are you doin'? Put that down.
You wanna spit on me and make me crawl?
I'm gonna piss on your grave tomorrow.
Hold it. Don't mess her up.
I don't want any marks on her body.
Look at this.
This is no Saturday-night special.
This is professional equipment.
- Probably got it from her cop boyfriend.
- You were right, Jake. Good work.
I recognised her when she swung that bottle on that broad's head.
- I don't forget nothin' like that.
- Get Aleva up here now.
- I wanna find out what this is all about.
- George sent her to hit you. What else?
Yeah. I never did have trust for that pimp. None of them niggers.
Nah, he'd never be so foolish.
This is somebody bigger than King George.
How 'bout it, chocolate?
Who set this up?
Spit it out.
He asked you a question.
It was King George.
He set it up. He's been workin' with the brothers all along.
Hit him.
And hit him so that everybody else will get the idea.
- Is this her?
- Yeah.
You know her?
Mr Vitroni, you got big trouble. Bigger trouble than you ever could imagine.
George, you gonna stay mad at me for ever?
I hurt, George. I feel awful.
You could at least talk to me.
Who's that for so early in the morning?
Some dude.
George, are you thinkin' about turnin' me out?
No, baby. No.
I just got so mad at the way you were treating that phoney black chick.
Yeah, I know.
I don't see why you have to go to all that trouble for that pervert gangster, anyway.
I'm just doing him a favour.
Most people appreciate favours.
They never forget you when you do them a favour.
There's somethin' funny about that chick.
Somethin' just not right.
That so?
- George?
- What?
- Please don't go.
- Baby, I gotta go out.
One of Vitroni's boys called with a buyer who wants to score right away.
I'll be back.
Let me take care of you.
I really feel like it now.
No, baby, not now.
Baby, you still love me, don't you?
Yeah. I still love you, baby, you know that. You're my lady.
Look, how long will it be before you'll be able to take a trick again?
About a week or so. Is that okay, baby?
Yeah. That's fine. Look.
You can take care of me when I get back, okay?
Okay. I'll be waitin', lover.
Hello, King. Hop in. Let's talk.
I'm sorry, man.
I can't argue with no.45.
Get rolling, Studs.
Okay, come on, you guys.
What's this shit? What's the gag?
- It's going to be very funny.
- I'll take this, King.
I know. I know.
The big man's got a bonus for me for that cool little trick I sent him, right?
That's right, King.
Jesus. You guys had me goin' there for a minute.
Hey, Studs! Look at him. Look at Studs.
Look at him. Hey, Studs.
Studs, baby, it's okay.
It's all right, Studs.
Hey, baby, they're just jivin'.
They're just puttin' you on.
- Big V was tickled almost to death.
- Really?
He said he'd never had nothin' like that before. Ever.
That's good. That's really great.
Hey.
Where we goin'?
That's the surprise.
We don't want to spoil it for you.
Hey.
Man, could I have my Kodak back?
I got a man who needs that today.
No, he don't, King. You quit your worryin'.
It's all gonna be over real soon.
Yeah, sure.
Studs, you stop here. This is okay.
Wait a minute. There's something you dudes ain't tellin' me.
- Out, King.
- No, man.
- Out!
- I am not gettin' outta this car.
Will somebody please talk to me?
Wait a minute! Somebody please tell me, man, what have I done?
It's a beautiful suit, King.
You remember I had a surprise for you?
A new necktie. Special woven.
14 nubile maidens.
Come on. Cut out the jokin'. Come on.
I can take a joke as good as anybody, man, but this has gone too damn far.
Man, tell me, what did I do?
What did I do?
I don't even know what I did.
Come on, now. Studs.
Studs, don't just sit there.
Do somethin'. Studs! Studs!
This is the way we lynch niggers.
Stop the car!
Guys, I'll do anything you want!
What did I do wrong? Jesus! Look out!
God, please! Stop the car!
What did I do?
Somebody tell... Jesus Christ!
You guys, stop the car!
Please! What did I do?
You wanna go fast, Studs?
Studs, that could be you if you like to talk.
I know, I know.
My mama didn't raise no fool.
Studs, you're a good boy.
You're going to need a job soon.
Come to us.
You'll find out we're not bad people.
This vicious combination of big business and government has kept our sisters prostitute and our brothers dope peddlers.
I was talking to a young man at the clinic.
He had so many needle marks he couldn't find a place for another spike.
He had to make at least one burglary each night to support his $100-a-day habit.
I asked him
"Why would anyone start smacking up when they know what the result is gonna be?"
He said "I'd rather be a junkie than be nothing." You see what this tells us?
Our power structure has given this man no reasonable alternative.
You ask "Why would a power structure deliberately create narcotics addicts?"
I ask you, where do you think that $100 a day goes?
Part of it goes to the black pushers and distributors, but the main part of it, the really big part, goes to those white men who import the narcotics.
The big part goes to those white men who corrupt our law-enforcement agencies.
And the big part goes to those white men who draft our black boys and send them over to Indochina to protect other white men who were the original suppliers of the narcotics.
It becomes a vicious attempt on the part of the white power structure to exploit our black men and women in this society.
Right.
Cut. That was good. We'll use the first part of that one and the ending of the last take.
Nice going, Howard. Real convincing.
Hey, out there. Is anybody there?
- Can I have somethin' to eat?
- Goddamn son of a bitch woman.
Shut up, bitch! Want me to give you another clout?
Can I have a glass of water?
Are you tryin' to starve me to death?
Never mind. Just keep quiet.
You won't need no water or nothin'.
Hello, Councilman.
Hello, McHenry.
Who else is here? Your boss?
Yeah. This is strictly summit stuff.
Personally, I don't know what it's all about and I don't wanna know.
You're a smart cop, Sergeant.
Mr Congressman Brunswick.
They tell me you kissed off your campaign today. How did it go?
- Very well.
- Yes?
Well, we're all behind you, all the way.
You should keep your boys away from where I'm appearing.
People keep turning up in photos.
Somebody'll start making comparisons.
I never appear in photographs.
True. Aleva is very careful about that.
Okay. What did you get me out here for, anyway?
I thought we'd agreed on everything.
I'm taking a chance being here.
It's dangerous for me too, Howard, but this is important.
Some very strange things have been happening.
There's something I don't know about.
Perhaps, Councilman. Perhaps.
Hey, darky.
You ain't gonna try to hit me with one of them rocks?
I'm so weak from hunger I couldn't even kick sand in your face, motherfucker.
There's a friend of yours inside wants to see you.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Gotta hand it to you.
You were a hundred per cent right.
He knows her all right.
He introduced her to me one night.
Sure I know her.
She's just some broad I fuck.
What's she doin' here?
This broad you fuck tried to kill me.
That's what she's doing here.
What?
That's right. Don't look at him.
Young lady, I want you to understand we have no personal thing against you at all.
I know that you were only following orders, so there is no reason why we cannot be friends, is there?
I'm not a bad man, like I told you.
I don't want to see a pretty young girl go to waste, with your whole life ahead of you.
Just tell me the truth and you can go free, and no harm will come to you.
Look, do you understand what it means when a man swears by his mother?
I swear by my mother.
Now, just tell me.
Did this man send you to kill me?
No. He didn't know nothin'.
Only King George, like I told you.
She's his girl.
What do you expect her to say?
Howard, I'm sure, personally, that you had nothing to do with this.
But this is a very serious matter.
We've got a very profitable relationship.
But it depends entirely on mutual trust and confidence.
That's right. We've gone a long way with you, Brunswick.
But if we have to, we'll find another congressman.
- Howard!
- Shut up!
You did your talking.
Why would I want to have you killed, Vitroni?
I like to steal as much as you do.
I can answer that, Mr Vitroni.
These people all stick together like brothers. You can't trust 'em.
Those two pushers that got killed last month had just come in with us.
Then King George double-crossing us.
All brothers, remember?
And he's one of them.
And money or deals or anything don't make him one of us. Shit.
You've been listening to my political speeches.
I thought you'd be more intelligent than to listen to that crap.
For Christ's sake, black, brown or yellow,
I'm in it for the green.
The green buck.
As far as that chick over there's concerned,
I'll tell you how much she means to me.
VITRONI: Yeah?
Take her...
Will you say that out loud so these people can hear you?
Take her out and kill her.
Now let's get down to some serious business.
Mac, the spike kit.
- Have you got the smack?
- Yeah.
Took some off our late friend the King.
I wonder where he's king of now.
No, thanks. Can't you read the package? It says smoking is dangerous to your health.
I didn't know that.
I'm gonna have to give this up.
You ever shoot up before?
Once or twice.
I can take it or leave it.
That's good. I can take it or leave it.
That's very good.
Mac, go down along the river, under the freeway.
Right. Good idea.
You're luckier than most people that gotta go out.
- This is just about the nicest way to do it.
- Yeah.
I just want you to know that, personally,
I think it's a damn shame to let a good piece like you go to waste.
Thanks. I do too.
Especially when I think of all the fun
I could've had with a stud like you.
Yeah?
You really mean that?
- Well, it ain't too late.
- It ain't.
Hell, no. I can take care of you right now.
Right here and now.
Nick, you go take a walk.
Not in my office you don't.
You wanna pull that shit, go on back there someplace.
Hey.
- Let me do this first.
- Okay. I'm not gonna fight you.
Mac, shine your light back here.
Don't look. Don't look.
Sh, sh, sh.
Come on, let's go.
- Shit! Hurry up, man.
- Okay. Just a second.
- Come on. Shit, what are you waitin' for?
- All right, all right.
Goddamn zippers.
Nick!
- What happened?
- She did it. You get her!
- I'm bleeding. Please help me.
- Mac!
Get a doctor.
Mac, take care of him. I'll get her.
Mac! Mac, please help me!
Get a doctor.
Sugar. Sugar!
Get an ambulance, please!
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'll take care of that.
Mac.
Mac, don't leave me!
Mac!
Come back!
MCHENRY: Help me. Help me.
Help me!
Help me, somebody!
Help me! This thing's gonna burn up.
Hey, baby. You need a ride or anything?
I sure do. I had some trouble with my boyfriend and got turned out.
That's too bad. Just get right in and let's see what we can do about it.
Could we stop at a liquor store and get some juice? I need a drink.
Okay.
Don't go away, beautiful.
I'll be right back.
I won't, baby.
MAN: Hey! Hey, come on back!
Gentleman, it does my heart good to see the various races getting together in such a spirit of cooperation.
Yes. I've gotta be going.
I've got a friend waiting,
I hope, very impatiently.
- Goin' out to your place at the beach?
- Yeah.
It's a good life, no?
It can be, Ruben. It can be.
Good night, gentlemen. I hope we don't have to meet like this again.
It's been a great risk.
So I looked at him and he said "That's all I got."
The boys should be back now.
I wonder if something went wrong.
I think I hear them coming now.
Sounds like he's really movin'.
Shit. Come on, now.
- Look, I ain't gonna shoot you.
- Please, don't shoot. Don't shoot.
I'll pay you anything.
A million dollars. Whatever you want.
A million dollars. You got a deal.
I won't kill you.
It's Brunswick I want, anyway.
Where is he?
He left. He went to his house at the beach.
Yeah. I know the place.
Thanks.
That's a present from my little sister, and a nice cop named Carter.
Hello, Howard. Come on and sit down and talk to me.
I'm not mad at you.
Coffy, baby.
I'm glad to see you.
I knew they weren't really gonna do it.
I ain't here because they didn't try, lover.
They would've done it anyway, no matter what I said. You know that.
Yeah, I know.
I told you, I ain't mad at you.
- Why don't you let me have the thing?
- No!
Before you try to take it, I think you better know that all your friends are dead.
Vitroni, Ramos, McHenry and some others too. I killed 'em all.
You?
I don't know how I did it.
It seems like I'm in a dream.
And I'm still in this dream, Howard. And it wouldn't take much for me to kill you now.
I can see how you might feel that way but... you don't understand all the facts.
I did what I did for my people, for our brothers and sisters.
You shouldn't talk to me about sisters,
Howard. I've got a sister.
Why don't you just relax and let me pour you a drink?
You're upset.
You can see that, can't you?
I can see plenty. I can see how each time a kid rips off a car or an appliance store or a house to get money for a fix, you get your cut.
Don't be naive. Do you think if I weren't mixed up with rackets there'd be none?
Wherever there's a need, somebody comes along to fill it.
Black people want dope, and brown people want dope, and as long as people are deprived of a decent life, they're gonna want something to just plain feel good with.
And nothing's gonna change that except money and power.
And that's what I'm after, baby.
Power to change things for our people.
I want all that money back in the hands of black people like you and me.
Yes, like you too, Coffy. You can help me, baby, to make a better life for our people.
Bullshit! You're just sellin' out to the white gangsters and businessmen.
You're worse than they are.
And I loved you. I loved you so much.
And you still do, baby.
You know it.
And I love you.
And we're gonna do big things together, baby, cos you're my woman, Coffy.
Maybe I have done a few bad things, but that's the way the world is today.
Sometimes you have to do a few little wrong things in order to do one big right thing.
That's what I'm trying to do for you and for our people - that one big right thing.
You always were a good talker, Howard.
You could talk me into almost anything.
But I don't know.
I just don't know any more.
All you have to know, baby, is that I'm your man.
I'm gonna take care of you and I'm gonna steer you straight.
I been missing you these past few days, Coffy.
And I've been wantin' you real bad.
Why don't you just put that thing down and come and fold yourself up in my arms and I'll make all this crap go away, like it's never been.
Come on.
Howie, what are you doing?
Come back to bed.
Coffy, baby. You gotta understand,
I thought you were dead.

- (MAN) Good evening.
- I'm Professor Ivarsson.
Yes, Sir Anthony has been expecting you.
It's in your hands, Milo.
- Stand fast. They'll come to terms.
- Very well.
If problems come up, consult with the board.
They know my thinking.
Ah, Professor Ivarsson.
I cannot tell you how grateful I am you've joined me.
I haven't agreed to anything.
Someone woke me up at 6.00 yesterday morning saying he was the
British ambassador.
It was the British ambassador.
He'd arranged my passage on a mail-boat to England, and a large man packed my bags and drove me to the dock.
- Your train leaves in ten minutes.
- Good. Come along, Ivarsson.
But the... Sir Anthony.
Expedition to the Arctic?
I'm hardly a professional explorer.
No, let me finish.
- I've had you looked into.
- Oh.
You're an American from the University of Minnesota, currently a guest lecturer at the University of Christiania.
Your specialty is the archaeology of the North.
In the past, you've led several successful expeditions.
You've done interesting work in Greenland.
Oh, no. You're the right man for the job, all right.
For what job? What's so urgent about it? What is it you hope to find?
My... son.
You see, my wife died when Donald was a child.
I began to groom him to take my place in the business.
I pushed him too hard, I think.
Anyway, we had words.
And suddenly,
Donald dropped everything and went off on a whaling ship as an ordinary seaman.
Three months later, I got word that he'd left the ship in Bathenland.
Why?
I had no idea until I received this from a trading post at Fort Conger on Ellesmere Island.
Donald had left it with the factor for safe keeping when he had gone off on some sort of expedition.
When he didn't come back, the factor sent it on to me.
(IVARSSON) It's an old page from a Hudson's Bay Company journal.
Look at the entry for January 15, 1856.
"To this post, this day came
John Merchison with his Eskimos,
"who hunt the white bear far beyond the land's end.
"He told of seeing a lone cloud, as if lying on the ice,
"and hidden beneath it, an island.
"This island, he sought to examine, but his Eskimos refused him,
"saying it's guarded by evil spirits.
"For it's the place where the whales go to die."
- We're coming into Dover now.
- Thank you.
Sir Anthony, the graveyard of whales is just a fantasy, a whaler's El Dorado, where he thinks he's going to find a fortune in whalebone and ambergris.
Fact is, it simply doesn't exist.
It's a legend, nothing more.
Legend or not, the graveyard is what my son went after.
It's my son I'm looking for.
- (MAN) Quarters?
- Take our luggage to the admiral DPO.
Sir Anthony, I'm afraid this has to be the end of the line for me.
I'd help if I could. I know how much this means to you.
But you're trying the impossible.
To try to find one man with nothing more than a page from a journal...
There is something more.
Donald also left this with the factor.
I was hoping you might know what it was.
Hm. It's a carved bone. It's Eskimo work. It's quite common in the Arctic.
- This one's a map.
- (ANTHONY) Map?
If I had a chart,
I could show you how this works.
My yacht is at the pier.
You can have all the charts you need.
(IVARSSON) This pattern will correspond to part of the shoreline here on the chart.
Look.
See how this matches.
It's not exactly to scale, of course.
(ANTHONY) Then this red mark could be what we're looking for.
If there were such an island.
- Why shouldn't there be?
- There's no land here.
It's just a gigantic frozen sea.
All explorers agree.
Peerey, Nance and all of them.
And what is Ivarsson's opinion?
Of course, there's a lot they haven't covered.
But if there were such an island, if the graveyard of whales really did exist...
The world will never know, will it?
Unless you discover it, or unless someone else beats you to it.
Sir Anthony, you're a devious man.
Yes, I am, aren't I?
I've got your contract here.
Your leave from the university.
Power of attorney. My solicitors will handle your affairs in your absence.
- We're under way.
- And have been for some time.
We'll be in France in the morning.
Why France? That's hardly the most direct route to Fort Conger.
On the contrary.
I think you'll find that it is.
Can't you slow him down?
You'd think we were leaving tomorrow morning.
We are.
What?
I said, we are.
First thing in the morning.
Impossible. It's winter.
No ship can get through the ice before spring.
- I've made other arrangements.
- What arrangements?
If I told you, you'd think I was mad.
Sir Anthony, you are mad.
And now you're gonna meet another mad one. Capt. Brieux!
Ah, Monsieur Ross!
What a pleasure!
He was building this for Americans, but he ran through all their money.
I heard of it and took it over.
- Ah, Capt. Brieux.
- Good evening, Sir Anthony.
- Professor Ivarsson.
- I'm honoured.
- Do you mind if I take a closer look?
- No, please.
I'm proud we'll have you for the ceremony tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
- What ceremony?
- Why, the first flight of my creation.
Tomorrow, the whole world will know of me on my Hyperion.
France will rule the air!
Whatever you planned, cancel it.
Tomorrow, we leave for the Arctic.
The Arctic?
The Arctic?
Sir Anthony, that's ridiculous!
It can't be done.
That's impossible.
We would need food, supplies, fuel for the motors.
The fuel, I'll leave to you, Captain.
All other necessities have been amply provided by my staff.
I think it is best that we have an understanding.
We have an understanding.
I bought and paid for your airship.
It's mine.
I intend to use it to find my son, who is lost in the Arctic.
But I cannot do it without your help.
I can offer you nothing except hardship and danger, except your place in history.
- History?
- Think of it, Captain.
You have an opportunity which comes but once in a generation.
The world will know you not only as the first man to fly over the Arctic, but the first man, perhaps, to brave the North Pole itself.
Today, we make history.
There should be flags, music, a speech from the president.
But what do we have?
Two children and a herd of goats.
When you bring her back to France, the celebration's gonna break all records.
- We are ready to depart.
- Very good, carry on.
Silence!
There will be no speaking.
Well, we are on our way.
A glorious day, Monsieur.
We rise with the sun.
Congratulations, Captain.
This will be a morning to remember.
Something in the food hamper just bit me.
That is not the food hamper, that is the small boudoir of Josephine.
It's some kind of a dog.
Of course, the best kind: French.
I am not interested in its nationality.
- Who brought it aboard?
- No one brought her aboard.
She lives here. This is her home since the airship was begun.
(ANTHONY) I'm not running some kind of flying kennel.
Get rid of it.
Very well, if you wish, Monsieur.
Of course, it will take time.
The sun has warmed the gas.
We must wait until night to return to the hangar.
- Then bring back the ground crew.
- Wait until night?
That will mean 12 hours.
I can't lose the time.
You're absolutely right, Sir Anthony.
Congratulations, Josephine.
We've signed on our ship's mascot.
Very well, but I don't like small dogs, and I never did.
Britain may rule the waves,
Sir Anthony, but the French airship rules the sky.
Already, we are speeding in triumph across the shores of your homeland.
It's raining as usual, I see.
- How far have we come?
- About 150 miles.
Hundred and fifty? In six hours?
Is that what you call
"speeding in triumph"?
We'll travel faster, but now my motors are at half-speed.
What on earth for?
Damn you!
- They must run themselves in.
- Poppycock!
I want full speed!
There are the controls.
If you want full speed, it is your responsibility, not mine.
What do you say now, Sir Anthony?
I say, I want full speed.
And I mean to have it.
You have your wish, Monsieur.
It's on your head.
- What's happening?
- Somebody route the propeller.
I followed your orders, Monsieur, and you see the result.
Now we must go back to France for repairs.
We will not.
We will proceed on one propeller.
The Arctic winds!
That would be insanity!
Without full power, my airship could not survive.
- I refuse to go forward.
- And I refuse to go back.
Well, gentlemen, we have to go somewhere.
Captain, you carry a spare propeller, don't you?
- That is right.
- Well, why don't we put it on now.
- In midair?
- Mm-hm.
- Impossible!
- Nothing's impossible.
Splendid idea, Ivarsson.
Come along. Give me a hand.
Sir Anthony!
May I remind you that I am in command here!
Only an idiot would attempt such a thing.
I will do it myself.
Do be careful and don't take any unnecessary risks.
Take good care.
The wind's coming up.
Let's haul him up.
Well done, Captain.
My congratulations.
Thank you, Sir Anthony.
I am deeply honoured.
What's he up to now?
Vive le France!
Top fellow, Brieux.
- The man's incredible.
- Brave, but mad as a hatter.
Musk ox.
Over there.
What are they doing?
They're forming a defensive ring.
They think we are attacking.
Captain, is it really necessary to fly so low?
It's easier to control the airship at this altitude.
No need to be alarmed, Sir Anthony.
Look, I'm in full command.
You made your point, Captain.
There's no need to overdo it.
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Take hold of the lines.
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Now, what I don't understand is, why
Donald took only one Eskimo with him.
Only one could be persuaded to go.
They all knew what he was looking for.
The mythical island, where the whales go to die.
One man's myth is another man's gospel, Mr Ivarsson.
Anyway, the Eskimos believe the island exists.
They're frightened to death of it.
Say it's guarded by evil spirits.
What about the Eskimo who went with him?
Oomiak's his name.
They call him "The Fearless One".
Though he was far from fearless when he came back.
- He came back.
- (MAN) Aye.
That's him out there.
Showing the captain how to fly his airship.
Fetch the fellow. Call him in.
I'm afraid you won't get anything out of him.
Call him in at once. Don't argue.
Very well, Sir.
Any man that goes off with my son and comes back alone...
- I'll see that he talks, all right.
- You'd better let me handle him.
You've never dealt with Eskimos.
They have a diplomacy all their own.
Blasted.
Why doesn't anyone think I have tact?
Come along, Oomiak.
Ah, so there you are.
What I want is an exact account of everything that happened...
Sir Anthony, this is the great Oomiak.
Who knows Oomiak?
Your fame has travelled far.
What fame?
Not even my dogs know me.
You were my son's guide.
What happened to him?
Who?
This is the father of Donald Ross.
We wanna know about your trip...
Tell us what happened when you left here to find the island.
- Island?
- Don't try to play that game with me.
Oomiak, I think you've seen this before.
This is where the whales go to die.
It's the island Donald was looking for.
Well, speak up, man.
My mind forgets.
Is The Fearless One afraid to help us?
We travelled many days.
Evil spirits watch us when we find island.
They make big blizzard.
Pshh.
Then they attack us.
I fight like bear. Ah!
Fight like bear, but evil spirits too strong!
So you ran away and left my son?
No, we both run, blind in snow.
When blizzard stop,
I search for many hours.
No Donald.
I tell truth.
You, Donald's father.
I, Donald's friend.
- His whole story is a pack of lies.
- Maybe.
But he's the only chance we have.
He could show us where he lost him and start searching there.
I don't suppose there's any chance he'd go.
No, Sir, none at all.
Nothing on earth would make him go back.
Nothing on earth.
Why don't you let one of them on.
He can tell the others about it.
- No. You let one aboard...
- What about this fellow?
He's been a great help. Would you like to see the inside of the airship?
Me?
- Yes, I like.
- (ANTHONY) Good man.
Give him a hand, Captain.
Why don't you show him around.
- Perhaps we can win him over.
- Well, we can try.
Captain, a word with you.
(SPEAKS IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Captain?
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
No, no, no, Monsieur.
Quite impossible.
There is no room, and we are overloaded now.
We could leave the mechanic.
Pick him up on the way back.
You ask me to fly without the mechanic?
But you have me.
Just tell me what to do.
I could, but you wouldn't do it.
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Looks like we're ready to leave.
I better take you down.
(SPEAKS IN FOREIGN
LANGUAGE)
Let go the lines there.
Wait, Oomiak's still onboard.
Hang it all, he's the only one who knows where Donald went to.
We could bring him back after he's helped us to find him.
Sir Anthony, since
I no longer have a mechanic, may I suggest that you first make fast the door, then go aloft and take in the landing lines.
Aye, aye, Captain.
We're here.
We can only guess how far the island is.
This Eskimo map is a little vague.
(ANTHONY) It's a lot to gamble on a piece of bone.
He's not much help to us either.
Did you expect him to be?
- (IVARSSON) Sir Anthony.
- Yes?
(IVARSSON) Come up, please.
There's been a report.
- (ANTHONY) What is it?
- Look over there.
- Whales.
- White whales.
Beluga. Indigenous to the Arctic.
Now look over there.
I say, that one's quite different.
The California grey. It's supposed to be found only in the Pacific.
A narwhal, the unicorn of the sea.
That's a rare sight, Sir Anthony.
By Jove, there are whales everywhere.
All kinds of whales.
And all moving in the same direction.
Exactly.
So there is a place where whales go to die.
Captain, that big lead of open water.
Follow it.
If we are on the right track, we'd have seen something.
Look. You remember the journal?
"A lone cloud, as if lying on the ice."
Oomiak.
Is that where the island is?
Wrong way. Wrong way.
Island not that way.
Island back this way.
- He told us what we wanted to know.
- Yes.
Steady as you go, Captain.
Look.
And hidden beneath the cloud, an island.
Captain. What happened?
Captain.
Captain, why are we stopping?
In such a cloud, it's not safe to proceed.
Not safe? What do you mean?
I could not see to navigate, and there will be strong winds.
My airship could be dashed against hidden cliffs and torn apart.
- We can't turn back now.
- We don't have to.
- We can go in on foot.
- Oh.
Capital idea!
Take the ship down to the ice.
- I'll get everything ready.
- No, no. You cannot leave the ship!
Professor, you know the dangers that lie below.
Even if you survive the cold, there are still the cliffs.
- You could not climb the cliffs.
- We must try, Captain.
I know. It's a gamble, Captain.
But with my son's life at stake,
I have no choice.
No, Sir Anthony, it is I who have no choice.
I'm not a man of stone.
There are times when the heart must rule the head.
We will attack the cloud.
- Maybe we can go above them.
- Impossible.
- Our load is too heavy.
- We'll assume lightweight.
Hurry up! We are losing height.
- You all right?
- Yes, quite.
I can't help thinking of the captain.
Poor fellow.
- How long must we keep this up?
- We can't survive in the open.
We've gotta keep moving until we find shelter.
There should be caves in those mountains.
Oomiak, is this anything like the place that you and Donald came to?
I tell you, Donald's father, we see nothing in blizzard.
Then spirits come and...
And you fought like a bear.
Yes, you mentioned that.
- Somebody watches.
- Where?
I don't see.
I feel.
Tommyrot.
Something moved.
- Did you see anything?
- I don't think so.
Neither did I.
I think we should head in that direction.
Oh, very well.
If you don't know where you're going, one way's as good as another.
It's incredible.
- I don't believe it.
- (ANTHONY) Green and fertile.
In all this ice and snow.
Look. There's the explanation.
The island must be volcanic.
Heat rising through fissures in the ground.
It's probably thermal springs.
Exactly like parts of Iceland.
There are buildings down there.
- (IVARSSON) Looks like a settlement.
- People. There are people there.
That means that Donald could be there.
The spirit! The spirit!
Wait a minute.
No, wait. We're friends.
Do you understand their language?
It's Norse.
The Old Norse of the sagas.
Their weapons, their clothes, their appearance.
- They're Vikings.
- Vikings?
They think we're invaders, come to take over their land.
- The three of us?
- No.
They think we're the first and thousands more will follow.
Why, that's ridiculous.
Talk to them.
Explain why we're here.
I'll try, but I've never spoken
Old Norse, only read it.
Donald?
That's it. Donald Ross.
Where is he?
Tell them I'm his father.
What is it? What's going on?
He understood me.
But he's going to sound an alarm to stir up the countryside.
We're to be kept under close guard.
Well, that's not good.
If they think we're invaders, then Donald could have been a prisoner all these months.
Make them tell us where he is.
Oomiak, no!
Idiot.
He might have got us all killed.
But he does fight like a bear.
He says you saved his life.
Well, I'm glad he appreciates it.
But tell him I don't want anything to happen to Oomiak.
Thank you.
He says your son is here and well.
He's living with the family of the man who found him after the great blizzard.
I knew it. I knew he was safe.
- (ANTHONY) What's happening?
- We're stopping to eat.
We just had a talk with our friend and found out why they're so panicky about invaders.
Oh? Why?
These people have been here for centuries.
They're descendants of some early Viking expedition.
We've actually discovered a lost colony.
That's quite remarkable.
They've been so isolated up here they believe that the rest of the world is a frozen wilderness of ice and snow.
How very odd.
- None of them ever left the island.
- They have no reason to.
They call this island Astragard and believe it to be the garden of the gods.
Perfect and unique in a desolate world and set aside for them alone. Forever.
- Why do they feel invaded?
- Because they have a prophecy.
There'll be a day when the barbarians will try to conquer their paradise.
Mm.
So that explains it.
They think that we're the savages who've come to destroy them.
Could be a bit tricky.
As soon as I get to their headman,
I'll straighten things out.
(IVARSSON) Reindeer.
Probably serve them as cattle.
That's the house where Donald's living.
Donald is there? Well, come on!
My son.
I haven't seen him for two years.
Tell them, Ivarsson.
I'll go with them, but not until I've seen my son.
Thank you, my boy.
Very decent of you.
They don't look happy to see us.
That hunter stirred them up.
I don't see Donald amongst them.
Thank you, Sir.
Donald, Donald Ross.
Where is he? Can you tell us?
Ask him about Donald.
Is it true you are Donald's father?
Good heavens, you speak English!
Donald taught me.
He lives with us since he came to our land.
This is my father.
I'm grateful to you for looking after my son.
Where is he now?
He wants us to go in the house.
We cannot talk here.
Oh, very well. Thank you.
So, what do you mean, they took Donald away?
Who took him?
The Godi's men.
They came with weapons.
The Godi's their high priest.
It was because of the hunter.
He rode down from the mountain, shouting of invaders.
- It was that fellow on the horse.
- Yes.
When The Godi heard, he sounded the long horn.
The long horn is their call to battle.
Battle? What battle?
What has this to do with Donald?
When it was told that one of the invaders was Donald's father,
The Godi said Donald was a spy who came here to betray us to the enemy.
- Surely you don't believe that.
- We don't.
Because we know Donald.
There were many that did believe because there was an omen in the sky.
Omen?
Like a whale, but bigger many times.
My dear girl, that's easily explained.
What the people saw was my airship.
You see, it's like...
It...
It's like one of your boats.
Only it sails in the air.
If I could just talk to this Godi,
I could explain everything.
We're to be taken before the council.
Erik's a member.
You'll get your chance to be heard.
That girl, she speaks better English than Oomiak.
She's prettier too.
If she learned it from Donald, he must have spent a lot of time in her company.
Can you blame him?
I can't say I do, no.
This is like an archaeologist's dream.
To go back in history and walk the earth as it was ten centuries ago.
I suggest you forget the past and start thinking about the future, which from the look of things,
I'd say is not very promising.
The clothes, the weapons, each one of them could be a museum piece.
That's what I don't like.
Those museum pieces.
Look at that.
A Viking longship, exactly the way they were built 1,000 years ago.
Poor fellow.
And it's all my fault.
The temple, that's where we're gonna meet the council.
Ah. Good.
"Go straight to the top," I always say.
Odin, Thor and Freyja.
The greatest of all the Viking gods.
I hope they're on our side.
We may need all the help we can get.
A Viking council.
Straight out of a history book.
There's the girl's father.
He seems a sensible old fellow.
(IVARSSON) They probably call the one with the staff "The Lawspeaker".
They all look reasonable enough.
They might be my board of directors if it weren't for their outlandish costumes.
He said, "Bring out the other prisoner."
- Donald!
- Father!
That's my son!
I've been looking for you.
I thought you might.
It's my son.
- John Ivarsson.
- (IVARSSON) Donald.
- How do you do?
- He's keen on the past. Archaeology.
Sorry about all this.
It's a bit sticky here, I'm afraid.
He says that when I came to this land,
I gave my oath that I came alone and in peace.
But now come others, and with them, an evil omen in the sky
- that cannot be ignored.
- That's my confounded airship.
Let them speak before they are judged.
That is precisely what I wanted to do.
- Father.
- I'll handle this.
You just translate for me.
- What do they call this island?
- Astragard. But, Father...
Shh, shh.
Honoured council of Astragard,
I come to your beautiful country as a friend...
...in peace,
- (SPEAKS IN OLD NORSE)
(ANTHONY) seeking only my son, who was lost to me.
The Godi.
He's telling them not to listen to our lies.
It's obvious that we're barbarians who covet their sacred lands.
And we must be condemned at once.
And without a hearing.
Now look here, I thought
I explained to you...
It is no longer a matter for the council, for the gods have spoken.
If these men are spared, more will come in armed hordes to pillage and profane our sacred land.
There can be but one penalty for the invaders: Death.
(CROWD CHANTING
IN OLD NORSE)
Quite a sendoff.
Full Viking honour.
All very authentic.
Very final.
- I'm sorry, Father.
- Nonsense, my boy.
Donald.
(DONALD) Freyja.
We're in your debt, young lady.
Here they come.
And pull.
The shore. It's our only chance.
You stay here. I will draw them away.
- No, you won't. It's too dangerous.
- He's right, my dear.
It's you they're after, not me.
There is a hunter's cave. Up there.
With food and clothing.
I'll be back when it's safe.
Freyja.
Here they come.
- I think she's done it. Good girl.
- I should never have let her go.
- If they catch her...
- Don't worry, my boy.
- She knows what she's doing.
- Let's find that cave.
Hello.
Oomiak! My dear old friend!
I'm so glad to see you!
- We all are.
- We thought we'd lost you.
You can't kill Oomiak. I hide in water.
Swim like white bear.
Good, good, but let's go.
- What now?
- There's still nothing.
Oh, Ivarsson's up above, scouting around.
Right.
- Morning, Father.
- Hmm? Morning.
- Did you sleep well?
- Wretchedly.
You must be a bit done in yourself.
I'm worried about Freyja.
So am I, my boy. So am I.
Well, I've made a mess of it, haven't I?
Of what?
The whole miserable thing, all this nightmare we're living in.
It's all my fault. Every bit of it.
Your fault? Why?
I'm the one who ran off chasing rainbows.
- You're not responsible for that.
- I am.
Right from the beginning.
I was always trying to shape you into my mould.
Bullying, badgering, never letting up.
If I hadn't driven you away, none of this would've happened.
Father, you didn't drive me.
Donald, I rode an airship across the top of the world to tell you this.
If we get out of this, you can do anything you want to do.
You'll be free of me, I promise you.
I don't want to be free of you.
I never did.
I came here looking for adventure.
And I certainly found that.
But I don't belong here.
Now, when we get out of this, and we will, I'm coming home with you.
I want to share in your work and your responsibilities.
If you'll let me.
If I'll let you?
You won't regret it.
I'll see to that.
- (FREYJA) Donald?
- Freyja!
He was quite worried about you.
I went back to the farm.
It'll be just as we arranged.
Father will give us dogs and a sled.
What had you arranged?
For some time, Freyja and I had been planning to leave the island.
We hope to reach Fort Conger.
The two of you, together?
You think I'd leave her behind?
Not if you're your father's son, no.
Boats, they come.
What do we do now?
There's not much cover, but we can get to the top without being seen.
That settles it.
We can't stay here. Those hounds would find us in no time.
Look, The Godi's joined us.
Bloodthirsty pounder.
Come on, everybody. Up we go.
They go. They go!
- (DONALD) They've given up!
- Thank heavens for that.
Look out, Father!
Clumsy of me.
Now the wolves are after us again.
Afraid so, Father.
It's incredible.
It's absolutely incredible.
- (ANTHONY) Nasty sort of place.
- Oomiak, go watch below.
- We need somewhere to hide.
- But where? They know this island.
- The Bay of Whales.
- Donald!
It's over there, to the south.
It's sacred, taboo.
The Vikings won't go near it.
That's it, then. Let's go!
No, Donald, please.
- The spirits.
- (DONALD) Freyja, believe me.
- What is it?
- The spirits are good spirits.
Didn't they protect your people when they first came here?
- Surely they'll protect us.
- (OOMIAK) They come. We go.
Freyja, trust me.
Come on up.
Oddly enough, they say this sulphur's good for the lungs.
Sir Anthony, this is hardly the time to rest.
I only hope we soon find that blasted Bay of Whales.
Come on.
My father.
Father!
Burning one minute, freezing the next.
A man could catch his death.
Well, that's what's so interesting about the Arctic. It's a contradiction.
- In my first expedition to Bathenland...
- Ivarsson, please. Stop!
What we need is a conference.
Conference? About what, Father?
If we find the Bay of Whales and if it's true The Godi won't follow us there, what do we do then?
We lie low.
Make our way across the mountains to Freyja's farm.
- We can't go back through that.
- No, no. We find iceboat. Float.
- Very good.
- (ANTHONY) Boat?
What's he talking about?
He wants to find a piece of pack ice and float around the mountain.
Preposterous.
Where the whales go to die.
All those great creatures from every sea, lying there, from the beginning of time.
Just look at all that whalebone.
Worth millions of pounds.
And heaven knows what price the ambergris would fetch.
All that doesn't matter now, does it, Father?
Freyja, don't be afraid.
Think of the saga.
Doesn't it tell how, long ago, it was the whales that led your people here?
Where they found peace and happiness, so there's nothing to fear.
Believe me.
We need iceboat.
How we get down there?
Yes, how?
Not down these cliffs, obviously.
There must be a way.
The Vikings found one.
Is it in the saga?
Does it tell how they came up?
With the help of the gods.
It is told that he came through the mouth of hell.
- That's not very explicit, I'm afraid.
- Wait a minute.
That volcano in Iceland, Mount Hekla.
The early Christians believed that was the entrance to hell.
- What?
- Entrance.
It's a wild thought. Come on.
- The crater of a dead volcano.
- Quiet.
You hear that? Down there, there's an underground river.
The river flows to the sea, which means there is a passage from the crater to the bay.
Ho, ho.
Come on.
Look, the water's running out.
- Come on.
- (ANTHONY) Where to?
Wherever the water went.
Look!
Do not worry.
I have sailed this way many times.
It's not this I'm worried about.
It's them.
Will they never give up?
I can't understand why the bowmen haven't been shooting.
They do not have to.
- They only wait to see us die.
- Freyja.
It's taught in the sagas that the bay is guarded by sea beasts.
We cannot escape.
- Killer whales.
- (ANTHONY) What do we do now?
Anything we can.
Here comes the other one.
Hold on, everybody!
The Hyperion!
And heaven be praised, our old friend the captain.
(ANTHONY) My compliments,
Captain. You keep an excellent table.
And you're an excellent shot.
You saved our lives.
- Thank you.
- An unexpected pleasure.
Since I landed two days ago,
I've been trying to save my own.
But getting out of here, that's going to be quite a problem.
- Isn't it, Captain?
- I have the solution.
My ship may be battered and torn, but the mind that conceived it, that still functions.
As you see, the ship has lost much gas, but it retains some buoyancy.
So if we reduce sufficiently the weight, then it will rise.
How would you reduce the weight?
Abandon the motors.
The propellers are broken anyway.
The gondola too.
Strip the ship of everything that weights it down.
What have we then?
- A free balloon.
- By Jove!
- It'd carry us across the bay.
- If we can reach the pack ice...
We shall go farther than that.
The prevailing wind is to the south.
If it holds, we should drift to Greenland.
When we reach the coast, we descend and proceed on foot to the nearest habitation.
Capt. Brieux, you are a very remarkable man.
I've always felt so.
- Sir Anthony.
- This is a bit much, isn't it?
Hardly the time for ceremonies.
Let's be off.
Please, Sir Anthony, this is a moment to be savoured.
Once more, we stand on the threshold of a great adventure.
To my Hyperion.
May she rise.
Like a phoenix from the ashes of despair.
And soar like Man's imagination to Greenland and beyond.
The Hyperion.
- Now, let's get going, shall we?
- (BRIEUX) Of course, Monsieur.
I will show you now the ingenious arrangements
I've made for our departure.
Perhaps you have observed that I've cut loose the gondola.
The ship is now attached to it by a single cable.
So also the motors and the tail.
This section, too, linked to the ship only by a cable.
When I slip these cables, the gondola, the motors and the tail detach themselves, and we rise.
Are you sure?
You will see.
Now, gentlemen, if you will assist me.
The gondola.
The motors and the tail.
When I say three, pull with all your force.
Right.
- Permission to proceed, Monsieur?
- What?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, proceed.
Very well.
One...
...two...
...three!
Well, Sir Anthony.
It worked perfectly.
Once again, Captain,
I underestimated you.
I'm turning in. I haven't had a good night's sleep since England.
- Sir Anthony.
- Hmm?
Take a look.
Campfires.
So they're still waiting for us.
It's a pity we'll have to disappoint them.
What is it?
You look frightened.
- A little.
- No, you mustn't be. It's all over.
We're safe now.
I know.
It is not that.
What, then?
It is the world beyond our mountains, your world.
Our world isn't really so different.
It's bigger, and everything moves faster.
We live by clocks and machines instead of tides and seasons.
You'll get used to it.
And be happy.
Because you'll be surrounded by people you love and who love you.
I wish my father could be with us.
I know.
But his home is Astragard.
His heart will always be here.
Mine is with you.
Ivarsson.
When does the first ship leave Greenland in the spring?
Usually, the beginning of April.
So with luck, we should be back in England in about six weeks.
I should not count on it, Monsieur.
The wind has changed.
We are drifting back to the land.
Well, can't something be done?
I cannot command the wind, Monsieur.
- We're rising.
- Got draft.
The wind against the cliffs.
What happens when we get to the top?
Everybody out. Quick.
It's true that the gods were angry, but it was The Godi who did wrong by leading the people to hatred and to violence.
I'm glad they recognise that.
The prisoners may go in peace on this condition, that they swear a sacred oath.
Never to reveal the existence of this sacred island.
That's fair enough.
To ensure that the oath be honoured for all time, we must demand one thing.
Well, go on. What is it?
That you leave a hostage here.
Your son.
I refuse to discuss it any further.
How could they imagine
I would leave you behind?
- Those are their terms!
- I will not permit it.
Without a hostage, none of us will leave.
- Blasted! Then I'll be the hostage.
- (IVARSSON) I don't think so.
As a matter of fact, everything's already been arranged.
And very satisfactorily for everybody, I think.
Are you sure it's what you want?
Are you sure you want to be left behind?
Yes, I'm sure.
This is a chance no archaeologist could turn down.
Not only to study the past, but to relive it. Here it all is.
Hidden behind mist for 1,000 years, and I haven't scratched the surface.
Besides, who says
I'm being left behind?
We archaeologists take a longer view.
Whole civilisations have vanished before, you know.
The day may come when this might be Man's last refuge.
Good luck.
Goodbye, my friends!
Somewhere in the vaults
of a bank in London
is a tin dispatch box with my name on it.
It is not to be opened
until 50 years after my death.
It contains certain mementos
of my long association
with a man who elevated
the science of deduction to an art.
The world's first and, undeniably,
most famous consulting detective.
To my heirs.
In my lifetime,
I have recorded some 60 cases
demonstrating the singular gift
of my friend Sherlock Holmes,
dealing with everything from
the Hound of the Baskervilles
to his mysterious brother Mycroft
and the devilish Professor Moriarty.
But there were other adventures which,
for reasons of discretion,
I have decided to withhold
from the public until this much later date.
They involve matters of a delicate
and sometimes scandalous nature,
as will shortly become apparent.
It was August of 1887,
and we were returning from Yorkshire,
where Holmes had solved
the baffling murder of Admiral Abernetty.
You may recall that
he broke the murderer's alibi
by measuring the depth to which
the parsley had sunk in the butter
on a hot day.
I wish you'd give me a bit more warning when you come home unexpected.
I'd have roasted a goose, had a few flowers for you.
My dear Mrs Hudson, criminals are as unpredictable as head colds.
- You never know when you'll catch one.
- I'll unpack your bags.
Here's an advance copy of Strand Magazine.
They've printed The Red-Headed League.
Would you like to see how I've treated it?
I can hardly wait. I'm sure I shall find out all sorts about the case that I never knew.
- Just what do you mean by that?
- You have a tendency to overromanticise.
You've taken my simple exercises in logic and embellished them,
- embroidered them, exaggerated...
- I deny the accusation.
- You say I'm 6'4"whereas I'm barely 6'1".
- A bit of poetic licence.
You saddled me with an improbable costume which I'm now expected to wear.
- It's not my doing. Blame the illustrator.
- You've made me out a violin virtuoso.
There's an invitation from the
Liverpool Symphony to appear as soloist.
Really?
I could barely hold my own in a second-rate music hall.
You're much too modest.
You have given the reader the distinct impression that I'm a misogynist.
Actually, I don't dislike women.
I merely distrust them.
The twinkle in the eye and the arsenic in the soup.
It's those little touches that make you colourful.
Lurid is more like it. You've painted me as a hopeless dope addict just because I occasionally take a five per cent solution of cocaine.
- A seven per cent solution.
- Five per cent.
Don't you think I'm aware you've been diluting it behind my back?
As a doctor, as well as your friend,
I strongly disapprove of this insidious habit of yours.
My dear friend, as well as my dear doctor,
I only resort to narcotics when I'm suffering from acute boredom, when there are no interesting cases to engage my mind. Look at this.
An urgent appeal to find some missing midgets.
- Did you say midgets?
- Mm. Six of them.
The Tumbling Piccolos, an acrobatic act with some circus.
Disappeared between London and Bristol.
Well, don't you find that intriguing?
Extremely so.
You see, they are not only midgets,
- but also anarchists.
- Anarchists?
By now they'll have been smuggled to
Vienna, dressed as little girls in pinafores.
They are to greet the tsar of all the Russias at the railway station.
They will be carrying bouquets of flowers, and concealed in each bouquet will be a bomb with a lit fuse.
- You really think so?
- Not at all.
The circus owner offers me five pounds.
That's not even a pound a midget.
Obviously he's a stingy blighter and the little chaps ran off to join another circus.
It sounded so promising.
There are no great crimes any more, Watson.
The criminal class has lost all enterprise and originality.
At best, they commit some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official could see through it.
Mrs Hudson! Mrs Hudson!
Yes. What is it? What have I done now?
- Something is missing from my desk.
- Missing?
- Something very crucial.
- What?
Dust! You have been tidying up against my explicit orders.
Oh, look, I made sure
I hadn't disturbed anything.
Dust, Mrs Hudson, is an essential part of my filing system.
By the thickness of it
I can date any document.
Well, some of the dust was this thick.
That would be... March 1883.
Oh!
How can you stand this?
Why don't you let me air the room out?
Please, Mrs Hudson, he's working on a definitive study of tobacco ash.
Oh, I'm sure there's a crying need for that.
In our endeavours it is sometimes vital to distinguish between, say, the ashes of a Macedonian cigarette and a Jamaican cigar.
So far he has classified
140 different kinds of ashes.
All of which'll wind up on my rug.
That will be enough, Mrs Hudson.
All right. If you gentlemen want to stay and suffocate.
- She's right, I am suffocating.
- Oh, let me open the window.
Not from lack of air, from lack of activity.
Blowing smoke rings, staring through a microscope. There's no challenge in that.
Personally, I consider it a major contribution to scientific criminology.
- How I envy you your mind, Watson.
- You do?
It's placid, imperturbable, prosaic.
My mind rebels against stagnation. It's like a racing engine tearing itself to pieces because it's not connected up with the work for which it was built.
Holmes?
Holmes. Where's your self-control?
Fair question.
- Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- Thoroughly. But this will take care of it.
There was nothing I could do when
he went on one of his cocaine binges
except hope and pray that some case
would come along to snap him out of it.
Why are you being so stubborn, Holmes?
Why won't you go?
It's the final performance of the lmperial Russian Ballet.
The house has been sold out for months.
Tickets are going at a guinea apiece.
That's just it. Why should someone send us two free tickets? Anonymously, at that.
Whoever sent them must be in great distress. The note says:
"Please! You are the only man in the world who can help me."
- I suspect it's some sort of plot.
- Somebody wants to lure us into a trap?
- Somebody wants to kill me.
- Kill you?
That's right. It's a plot to bore me to death. I detest ballet.
But this isn't just any ballet... it's Swan Lake.
You know, of course, Holmes, that swan isn't really a swan.
- It's an enchanted princess.
- Hm.
Fabulous woman, don't you think so, Holmes?
- Who?
- The great Petrova.
Very strong arches, I must admit.
- They say 12 men have died for her.
- Really?
Six committed suicide, four were killed in duels, and one fell out of the gallery of the Vienna Opera House.
That's only 11.
The man who fell from the gallery landed on top of another man in the orchestra.
That makes an even dozen.
In a messy sort of way.
- Mr Holmes?
- Yes.
I am Nikolai Rogozhin, director-general of the lmperial Russian Ballet.
- So glad you accept invitation.
- This is Dr Watson.
Pleased to meet you.
- You are enjoying?
- Immensely.
Tell me, Mr Holmes, how is your health?
My health? Better consult my doctor.
Oh, he's in excellent shape.
Any insanity in your family?
Diabetes, asthma?
- Would you tell me what this is all about?
- Certainly.
Madame Petrova... she has problem.
- Can you be more specific?
- Certainly not.
Liaison with a crowned head?
Compromising letters? Blackmail?
After performance there will be little celebration backstage and Madame requests your presence.
We'd be delighted.
You are invited also.
Ah!
Mr Holmes, Madame is expecting you in her dressing room.
Dr Watson, you will amuse yourself.
- We have vodka, caviar, girls.
- No, thank you.
- No girls?
- No caviar - makes me break out in hives.
Poznakomtes s doktorom Watsonom.
Any of you girls understand English?
Nyet.
- Not one single word?
- Nyet.
In that case, I don't mind telling you that you all have lovely po-pos.
Mr Holmes, I must prepare you.
This is not ordinary case.
It's only the extraordinary that interests me.
Good. Because you will find this extra-extraordinary.
May I present Madame Petrova.
Madame.
Madame says you are shorter than she thought.
Oh, I didn't mean to be.
Short, tall, who cares?
It is the brains that count.
Thank you. Thank you.
...Baskerville.
Madame is great admirer of yours. She has read every story. Her favourite is...
Big Dog From Baskerville.
I'm afraid it loses something in translation.
Nikolai...
Mr Holmes, you know about fiddles.
What is your opinion of this?
"Antonius Stradivarius Cremonensis."
"Anno 1709."
Well, the label is authentic.
Judging from the shape, colour of the varnish and the tone,
I would say it is a genuine
Stradivarius of the best period.
- You like?
- Oh, it's magnificent.
Nikolai.
Here, take it.
- Madame says it is yours.
- Mine?
For services you will render.
My fees as a detective are not exactly trifling, but a Stradivarius?
- You're not serious?
- I am not.
But Madame is.
All right. I will pour vodka and explain.
Mr Holmes, what you have seen tonight is last and positively final performance of Madame Petrova.
- She is retiring.
- What a shame.
She has been dancing since she was three. And, after all, she is now 38.
I must say, she doesn't look 38.
That is because she is 49.
Madame has decided to leave ballet and spend life bringing up her child.
- How admirable.
- Problem is, how to find father.
- Is he missing?
- Correct.
- And that's why you've called me in.
- Also correct.
We must have father because, without father, how could there be child?
I see. The whole thing is still in the planning stage.
Correct again. Madame would like child to be brilliant and beautiful.
Since she is beautiful she needs man who is brilliant.
- What's in it?
- What does it taste like?
- Red pepper.
- That's what's in it.
I beg your pardon?
- When can you be ready?
- Ready?
To leave for Venice. You will spend one week there with Madame.
This is very flattering, but surely there are other, better men?
To tell truth, you were not the first choice.
We considered Russian writer, Tolstoy.
That's more like it.
The man's a genius.
Too old. Then we considered philosopher, Nietzsche.
- Absolutely first-rate mind.
- Too German.
Then we considered Tchaikovsky.
- You couldn't go wrong with Tchaikovsky.
- We could. And we did.
It was catastrophe.
- Why?
- You don't know?
Because Tchaikovsky is...
How shall I put it?
Women, not his glass of tea.
Oh, pity, that.
Madame is very happy with her final choice.
Madame must not be too hasty. She must remember that I am an Englishman.
- So?
- You know what they say.
The one thing more deplorable than our cooking is our lovemaking.
- We are not the most romantic of people.
- Perfect.
We don't want sentimental idiots falling in love, committing suicide.
One week in Venice with Madame, she goes back to St Petersburg with baby, you go back to London with fiddle.
An equitable arrangement.
About my medical history...
When you asked me I neglected to mention one small detail.
- There is haemophilia in my family.
- Huh?
We are all bleeders.
- Not to worry, she will not scratch you.
- That's reassuring, but...
Madame says you talk too much.
You find her attractive or no?
Well, I, er...
Oh, excuse me.
What does prokaznik mean?
It means "you little devil".
It does? I am? Thank you!
I repeat question.
You find Madame attractive or no?
Oh, I find her most attractive.
- For a woman, that is.
- Then no problem.
Maybe a slight one.
You see, I am not a free man.
Not free? But you are bachelor.
A bachelor living with another bachelor for the last five years.
Five very happy years.
What is it you are trying to tell us?
Well, I hoped I could avoid the subject, but, some of us, through a cruel caprice of Mother Nature...
Get to point.
The point is that Tchaikovsky is not an isolated case.
You mean you and Doctor Watson?
He... is your glass of tea?
If you want to be picturesque about it.
...Tchaikovsky?
Believe me, Madame, the loss is all mine.
But I would rather disappoint you now than in a gondola in Venice.
It would have been... catastrophe.
- Watson! Are you coming?
- What is it?
- We're going home.
- Home?
Not a chance. Not the slightest, not the remotest chance. Toodle-oo!
Hold on.
Just one moment.
What's going on?
- What happened to the girls?
- Why? Do you not prefer it this way?
- What way?
- You don't have to pretend.
Mr Holmes told us everything.
- About you and him.
- About me and him?
Come! No need to be bashful.
We're not bourgeois.
Maybe between doctors and detectives is unusual, but in ballet... is very usual.
What is?
Caprice of Mother Nature.
Look at Pavel and Mischa,
Boris and Dimitry and Illya and Sergei.
Sergei... half and half.
Holmes!
Holmes!
There you are! You wretch!
You... rotter! You blackguard!
Of all the vile, unspeakable fabrications!
What do you have to say for yourself?
Well, don't just sit there! Speak up, man!
Holmes?
Are you all right, Holmes?
Holmes?
From the sound of your footsteps I gather you're not in a particularly amiable mood.
How... how could you invent such a dastardly lie?
What the deuce were you thinking of?
Watson, you have my most abject apologies, but have you ever been cornered by a madwoman?
It seemed like the only way to get out of it without hurting her feelings.
And what about my feelings?
And my reputation?
Do you realise the gravity of this?
The possible repercussions?
- So there'll be a little gossip about you.
- These things spread like wildfire.
I can just hear those malicious whispers behind my back.
I'll never be able to show my face in polite society.
And if it ever got back to my old regiment...
You don't know the Fifth Northumberland
Fusiliers! They'll strike me off the rolls!
- They'll cut off my pension!
- Watson, you're running amok.
Dishonoured, disgraced, ostracised.
- What am I to do?
- For one thing, I'd get rid of that flower.
You may think this is funny but we're both in the same boat.
We must take desperate measures.
We must stop this talk.
Maybe if we got married.
Then they'd really talk.
Obviously, we can't continue to live under the same roof. We must move apart.
Of course, we can still see each other clandestinely on remote benches in Hyde Park and in the waiting rooms of suburban stations.
This whole thing's ridiculous.
- We have nothing to hide.
- That's what I tried to tell you.
Let somebody start a rumour. Just one ugly word, we'll sue 'em for slander.
No one would dare. After all, you have an enviable record with the fair sex.
Damn right. I can get women from three continents to testify for me.
And you can get women to vouch for you too, can't you, Holmes?
Can you, Holmes?
Good night, Watson.
Holmes?
Let me ask you a question.
I hope I'm not being presumptuous, but there have been women in your life?
The answer is yes... you're being presumptuous.
Good night.
Holmes?
What, indeed, was his attitude
towards women?
Was there some secret
he was holding back?
Or was he just a thinking machine,
incapable of any emotion?
I was not to get the answer
until we became involved
in what I consider to be the most
outrageous case in all our years together.
- Were you expecting someone?
- Not at this hour.
Maybe Mrs Hudson is entertaining.
I've never found her so.
- I don't know.
- Can I speak to the master?
- He's in bed.
- It's important.
- What is it, Mrs Hudson?
- A cabby says you owe him two and six.
- For what?
- For the fare, guv'nor.
- The young lady don't have no money.
- What young lady?
This one.
Well. What have we here?
Who are you, miss?
What happened to you?
I don't know.
It's all she keeps saying.
"I don't know, I don't know".
- Where did she come from?
- The river.
I was driving down the embankment, just below Westminster Bridge.
There she was, in the water, drowning.
Wasn't easy, guv'nor, what with the cold water and her fighting me.
Why did you bring her here?
Because... I found this in her hand.
"221 b Baker Street."
That's right, isn't it?
Young lady, what did you want at this address?
I do not remember.
- Rather perplexing, wouldn't you say?
- Rather.
Well, gentlemen.
You want her, it's two and six.
- Or shall I throw her back in the river?
- Mr Holmes, you can't let him do that.
Watson, you'd better accept delivery.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you, guv'nor.
No extra charge for the use of the horse blanket.
You're shivering, my dear.
Let me get you out of those wet clothes.
Sit here, my dear.
She's suffering from shock and exposure.
There was some printing on the back but it seems to have come off in the water.
Look at this.
She's had a nasty blow on the head.
Could she have hit her head when she fell or jumped into the river?
No. The blood had already coagulated.
So it would appear that she was the victim of a deliberate attack.
Get my bag, will you?
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr Watson.
And this is Sherlock Holmes.
- Do the names mean anything to you?
- No.
Think.
I'm trying.
Can you think of your own name?
No.
She's obviously had a concussion, which often leads to temporary amnesia.
So all we know is she was coshed on the head, dumped into the Thames and subsequently dumped into our laps.
We know a lot more than that.
From her accent, we know she's foreign.
From her ring, we know she's married.
- There's one other clue we have.
- Namely?
Something I deduced while I was helping her up the stairs.
No corset.
Good work.
"La Femme Elegante."
Are you French?
Vous êtes Française?
Non. Je ne suis pas Française.
How can she say she's not French, in French?
Vous êtes Suisse?
Non.
Alors, vous êtes Belge?
Je ne suis pas sûre.
Vous êtes Belge, de Bruxelles?
Bruxelles.
Oui. Je pense que oui.
Oh, dash.
- Will someone remove this violin, please?
- We just found out she's Belgian.
- Poor thing.
- From Brussels.
If you don't mind.
Is your name Gabrielle?
Gabrielle?
I don't know.
- And your husband's name is Emile.
- Emile.
- Where is he? Why are you in London?
- I don't know.
When did you arrive from Brussels?
Where are you staying?
- I don't know!
- What happened at the river?
Think!
Pensez!
Concentrez-vous!
That's enough, Holmes. I will not permit you to question her in this condition.
Here, Mrs Hudson.
Put her to bed. My bed.
I'll sleep on the couch.
- Come on, dear. Don't cry.
- I'd better give her a sleeping draught.
- I think we should take her to a hospital.
- Under no circumstances.
- She needs medical attention.
- She's got me.
More important, she must be protected.
There's already been one attempt on her.
- How temporary is temporary amnesia?
- It depends on the extent of her injury.
It's like veils, shrouding her memory.
It could clear up in a few days or a few weeks.
This is a very small flat.
We don't want to clutter it up with women.
Holmes, we've never had a case like this.
A woman comes with a problem, we don't know who she is or what the problem is.
- Don't you find that challenging?
- Quite.
But we can't wait for these veils to lift. We must break them as quickly as possible.
- You really feel it's that urgent?
- I do.
The sooner we solve the case, the sooner we can get rid of her.
Oh.
Emile?
Emile?
Emile!
Is that you, Emile?
Yes, Gabrielle.
Oh, Emile. I thought
I would never find you. Oh!
Hold me. Hold me tight.
It's been such a long time.
So many nights.
Do you know what I did before I left Bruxelles?
- What?
- I hope you're not going to be angry.
I bought myself an expensive negligee.
Did you?
A pink negligee.
With marabou feathers.
Don't you think it's a little bit foolish for a married woman?
Come.
Come.
- Where is the negligee?
- In my luggage. Come here.
And where is your luggage?
I don't know.
Come, my love.
Come. Come here. Please. Oh, please.
Come here.
What is it, Emile?
What are you doing?
Dr Watson!
Ooh.
Porridge is getting lumpy.
Hadn't you better get up?
I would like to very much, but...
Would you mind planting your knee in the small of my back?
- Yes, I would.
- Please. I'm in excruciating pain.
A bit higher.
Just below my seventh vertebra.
That's good. Put your arms under mine.
Now fold them behind my neck.
Now give it a good snap.
No, no. Show no mercy, bear down on me.
Ow!
Bless you. That damn couch.
Oh, you'd better see if our patient is awake.
Dr Watson.
She's gone.
Gone?
Holmes! Holmes!
She's gone!
Well, I never.
Mm. I smell porridge.
Lumpy as usual, I suppose.
Ah, there you are.
We were just wondering...
We certainly were.
Mrs Hudson, why don't you go down to the kitchen, get a towel, and wipe that look of disapproval off your face.
Hmph.
Liberties. In my house.
You can't really blame her.
I mean, the way it looks.
If I didn't know you better,
I might suspect you'd taken advantage.
As a matter of fact, I did.
Would you hand me the butter knife?
Of course.
- You did what?
- Thank you.
Holmes, this is reprehensible.
Where are your professional ethics?
Have you no sense of decency, no shame?
None whatsoever. If you must know,
I found her body quite rewarding.
- You cad!
- Especially the palm of her right hand.
I'd rather not hear about it.
Then I won't bother to tell you how I traced her suitcase.
- That's hers?
- Remember the piece of soggy cardboard with our address on it?
It was a luggage ticket.
The number had rubbed off on her hand.
Since she must have come by the boat train,
I concluded that she checked her belongings at Victoria Station.
By Jove! If you're right, we should find a clue to her identity.
Or at least a pink negligee with marabou feathers.
- Voilà.
- Well, let's see, what else is in here?
Ah!
Now we're getting somewhere.
Ah.
Who do you suppose this is?
Good morning, Madame Valladon.
- You are Gabrielle Valladon?
- Yes.
And this is your husband, Emile Valladon?
Yes.
Sorry to have ransacked your valise, but since you came to us for help...
- Where am I?
- 221 b Baker Street.
Oh, yes.
Which of you is Sherlock Holmes, and which is Dr Watson?
Dr Watson is the handsome one.
Oh.
That's the way he affects most women.
Coffee. You want some strong coffee.
- Oh, it's all so confusing.
- Well, let's try to sort it out.
You came to London looking for your husband, right?
Yes.
He's a mining engineer. We were married five years ago in the Congo.
Where your husband was working in a copper mine.
- How did you know?
- Your wedding ring. It's made of copper.
Last year, he invented a new kind of air pump and was hired by an English company,
Jonah Limited.
Here we are.
Jonah Limited. Go on.
We'd been writing to each other regularly, then, suddenly, three weeks ago, his letters stopped.
I kept on writing but no answer.
So, finally, I decided to go to that address.
32 Ashdown Street.
Yes.
It's just an empty store.
Nobody there.
So I tried to find Jonah Limited.
- No such company exists.
- How decidedly odd.
Madame, can you think of any reason why your husband should have lied to you?
Emile? Never.
- He loves me and I love him.
- I gathered that much.
I went to the police. They said they would send out a missing persons report.
But they didn't sound too encouraging.
Then I went to the Belgian embassy.
- They suggested I should consult you.
- You could have done worse.
I was on my way here when, suddenly, there were footsteps behind me and a hand over my mouth and the smell of chloroform and the next thing I knew I was in the water.
And then a man was wrapping me in a blanket.
Somebody tried to kill you last night. Do you have any idea who could've done it?
I don't understand any of it.
What does it all mean, Mr Holmes?
Where's my husband?
- You must help me find him.
- We'll do our best, I assure you.
Madame Valladon, I want you to send one more letter to your husband.
To Emile Valladon, Ashdown Street.
What was that number?
32. What do you want me to say in the letter?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
Holmes. You're sending an empty sheet of paper to an empty shop?
That shop is obviously being used as an accommodation address or letter drop.
But what gets dropped must be picked up.
The question is, how, and by whom, and why.
Hammer.
Chisel.
Here.
It's so strange to think I've been writing to a place like this all these months.
Look. Canaries. Do you suppose this could have been a pet shop?
Maybe.
Shh!
Here comes our letter.
Well, now we are faced with the most nerve-wracking part of a detective's job.
Doing nothing. Just waiting.
Mr Holmes? I don't know how
I'm going to pay for all this.
My money is somewhere at the bottom of the Thames.
It could be worse. You could be there too, much to your discomfort, and much to my chagrin.
I don't understand how anybody picks up letters here.
There's no footprints. Just tracks.
What does it mean?
I'd surmise somebody is using ice skates if it weren't for a conspicuous absence of ice.
What do we do now?
This way.
Good morning, my pretties.
Here's Mum with your breakfast.
Did you think I'd forgotten you?
Some of you will be going on a little trip soon, eh?
I hate to lose you, but even an old woman's got to live.
Although you might well ask why.
Ooh.
You never told me. We have a letter.
Oh!
- Got it?
- Yeah, I've got it.
Right, open the cage.
- Morning, duchess.
- Good morning.
- What've you been doing with yourself?
- What do you think?
Taking dancing lessons.
- How many do you want this time?
- Two dozen.
Two dozen? What are you doing with all those canaries? What goes on up there?
Look, duchess, we don't know.
And we don't want to know.
When you work for Jonah, it's better not to ask questions.
Six, eight, ten. Get in there!
- In you go. 20.
- How about that letter? Does that go too?
- No.
This is going to be picked up in person.
Right, I've got it.
Right, up.
All right, my pretties, back to sleep you go.
Oh!
- I really thought we were done for.
- The art of concealment, my dear Watson, is merely a matter of being in the right place at the right time.
Did you hear what she said?
You really think Emile is going to pick up the letter himself?
It certainly would simplify things, wouldn't it?
Letter drops, wheelchairs, canaries.
What was all that about Jonah? What are they doing up there? Where's up there?
My guess would be Scotland.
- Inverness to be more precise.
- Inverness?
Didn't you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage?
The Inverness Courier.
Mr Holmes. This letter.
What about it?
It is addressed to you.
To me?
- That's impossible. We sent it ourselves.
- Nevertheless.
"My dear Sherlock, I expect you and Dr Watson to join me at the club immediately upon receipt of this note."
"According to my calculations that should be at 11.40 am."
"Your brother, Mycroft."
- What time do you make it, Watson?
Either your watch is wrong or Mycroft has miscalculated.
And, knowing Mycroft,
I suggest you reset your watch.
Holmes. I don't mind telling you,
I'm a bit apprehensive about this.
I'm curious myself to know what's going on in his Machiavellian mind.
Not Mycroft, Madame Valladon.
Don't worry.
She'll be perfectly safe with Mrs Hudson.
- To see Mr Mycroft Holmes.
- Right you are, sir.
He's expecting you in the upstairs study.
Now, if you gentlemen will sign in.
Surname, Christian name, address...
Oh!
Gentlemen!
Hm. Jamaican, no doubt.
Either Tropical or Gonosina.
I'm not quite sure.
Come in. Come in, Sherlock,
Dr Watson. Sit down.
- You're looking very fit, both of you.
- Thank you.
- How are you, Mycroft? How's your gout?
- Under control.
Except for an occasional twinge.
I've got a treat for you.
Very old Madeira. 1814.
Only six bottles in the world.
I've got two and I'm negotiating for a third.
If you don't mind my saying so, anyone susceptible to gout shouldn't be...
My last doctor was crossing Piccadilly, slipped on an orange peel and was run over by a delivery van from
Fortnum and Mason. Your good health.
Why are you wasting this precious stuff on us?
I see you so rarely.
How long has it been?
Not since the Case of the Greek Interpreter.
Isn't it ridiculous?
Two brothers in the same town...
In the same town perhaps, but not in the same world.
This is superb.
How old did you say it was?
1814. One year before Waterloo.
One year before Waterloo. Think of that!
You do know where Waterloo is, don't you, Doctor?
Er, why, it's... it's in Belgium, isn't it?
Quite. And speaking of Belgium, it's come to my attention that you are interested
- in the whereabouts of a certain engineer.
- Yes, I am.
- Well, I can save you a lot of trouble.
- I'd be grateful for any suggestion.
My suggestion is that you pursue it no further.
- For any particular reason?
- It involves the national security.
- We are handling the matter ourselves.
- We? Who's we?
- The Diogenes Club.
- I didn't say that.
I've long suspected some underground connection between this stodgy and seemingly calcified establishment and Whitehall.
- That is neither here nor there.
- Your club is here, there and everywhere.
When there are rumblings of revolt in the
Sudan an expedition funded by your club conveniently shows up to study the source of the Nile.
If there's trouble along the Indian frontier, members pop up in the Himalayas, allegedly looking for the abominable snowman.
What a vivid imagination my brother has.
At five, by observing a neighbour's house, he deduced that babies were brought not by the stork but by the midwife in her bag.
- Yes, Wiggins?
- An immediate answer is requested, sir.
Oh, yes.
Hm.
The three boxes go to Glennahurich, the red runner to the castle.
The boxes to Glennahurich, the red runner to the castle. Very good, sir.
Why don't you crumple it up and swallow it, just to make sure?
Certain affairs do not come within the province of the private detective.
They have to be dealt with on an altogether different level.
- You want me to stay within my limits.
- I do indeed.
And speaking of limits, what exactly is Jonah Limited?
When I said drop this case, it was not merely a suggestion, it was an order.
- By whose authority?
- Her Majesty's Government.
I hope I have made myself clear.
- Perfectly.
- And now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen.
- Goodbye, sir.
- A pleasure, as always.
Just a minute.
You forgot your tool kit.
You will be gentle when you tell her you're dropping the case?
- What does "Glennahurich" suggest?
- Absolutely nothing.
It's Scottish. And like all Scottish names it's really a word picture.
Glen means "valley", na means "of the", and hurrich, if memory serves me, means "yew tree".
You're just trying to impress me.
So, the three boxes go to the valley of the yew tree.
~ And I'll be in Scotland afore... ~
- You are dropping the case, aren't you?
- Open that door.
Don't shoot, you're liable to lose two excellent tenants.
Oh, at last.
- It's been a ghastly experience.
- Why? What happened?
Did you ever try doing embroidery with a gun in your hand?
You'll be relieved to know it was not loaded.
Holmes. Are you planning to disobey Mycroft's orders?
He's not just your brother. You'd be defying Her Majesty's Government.
Any news? Did you find out anything?
Let's just say I know what the next step will be.
- Yes?
- I want you to pack your things.
- Where are we going?
- Let me caution you.
At 7.30, we're going to take you to Victoria
Station and put you on the boat train.
- The boat train?
- Well, that's better.
- You're sending me back to Bruxelles?
- You must understand...
I came to find my husband.
You were going to help me.
Yes, but circumstances have changed.
The great detective.
Maybe this case is too small for you.
On the contrary, it's being handled...
I won't go back to Bruxelles.
Maybe you're giving up, but I am not.
I'm going to go on looking for him and nobody's going to stop me.
- Even if they try to kill me.
- Are you quite finished?
What I said was that we will put you on the boat train.
- I didn't say you would stay on it.
- She won't?
At 7.30, Mr Holmes and Dr Watson will be seen waving goodbye to Madame Valladon at Victoria Station.
At 8.12, Mr and Mrs Ashdown, accompanied by their valet, John, will appear at Euston Station and board the Highland Express to Inverness.
Mr and Mrs?
Thank you.
I'm sorry for what I said.
That's not necessary.
I'll go and pack.
Maybe I should do it since I'm the valet.
Holmes, exactly what are you up to?
As you like to put it in your chronicles, the game is afoot.
But what game? Are you really that interested in the Belgian engineer, or is it the wife of the Belgian engineer?
- You don't like me very much, do you?
- Nothing of the sort. Quite the opposite.
But there's more to this case than meets the eye.
Looking for something?
Yes. My other glove.
Let me help you.
Here it is.
Thank you.
All right, you can look now.
- Am I embarrassing you, Mr Holmes?
- Not at all.
Would it surprise you if I told you
I once spent a night with 121 women?
Oh?
On a very interesting case in a harem in Constantinople.
I'm sorry, Father.
I mean, Friar.
Or is it Abbot?
Going to Scotland, you gentlemen?
So are we.
I'm a valet. My master and mistress and I are on our way to Inverness.
Ever been there? Beautiful country.
Oh, forgive me. You must be one of those orders that's taken the vow of silence.
Trappists, I think you're called.
I see you're reading the book of Jonah.
Funny, we were just talking about Jonah this morning.
Never mind.
Hm.
"Women are never to be entirely trusted, not the best of them."
- What did you say?
- I didn't say it, you did.
According to Dr Watson. He gave me some old copies of Strand Magazine.
The good doctor is constantly putting words into my mouth.
- Then you deny it?
- Not at all.
I am not a wholehearted admirer of womankind.
I'm not very fond of them myself.
The most affectionate woman
I ever knew was a murderess.
Oh?
It was one of those passionate affairs at odd hours right in my laboratory.
And all the time she was stealing cyanide to sprinkle on her husband's steak and kidney pie.
- You mustn't judge all women by...
- Of course not.
Only the ones I was involved with.
And I don't just mean professionally.
Kleptomaniacs, nymphomaniacs, pyromaniacs...
- Take my fiancée, for instance.
- Your fiancée?
Mm.
She was the daughter of my violin teacher. We were engaged to be married.
The invitations were out,
I was being fitted for a tail coat, and 24 hours before the wedding she died of influenza.
I'm sorry.
It just proves my contention that women are unreliable and not to be trusted.
Good night, Mrs Ashdown.
Good night, Mr Ashdown.
Die Spur führt nach Inverness.
Dort steigen die aus.
Dort müssen wir ihn finden, den Valladon.
- I will take that.
- Let's see now. One, two, three, four, five.
How do you get to Glennahurich?
How far is it?
- Glennahurich?
- You know, a valley with a yew tree.
It's about a mile out of the town.
Why do you want to go there?
It sounds like a peaceful place for a picnic.
It's peaceful, right enough, but it's no place for a picnic.
- Why not?
- Because it's a cemetery.
- The three boxes. Is that it, Holmes?
- I would think so.
The two small ones, they must be children's coffins.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with us all. Amen.
It's so sad.
Sad and rather odd.
There were no flowers and no mourners.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Working you hard?
- No, not really. This is healthy country.
Sometimes you sit for weeks with nothing to do then you get three in one day.
- What happened?
- An accident. Aye.
A father and two sons, they say.
They were found floating in the loch.
- Local people?
- No, no. No one round here knows them.
The story is their boat capsized in a swell, but I don't believe it.
What do you believe?
You may think I'm an old fool or an old drunk, but I've been living around Loch Ness all my life.
Are you trying to tell us it was the monster?
Damn right. MacLarnin saw the kids' faces when they were pulled out.
Looked just like old men.
They must have died of fright.
- That's incredible.
- Is it?
Last Easter Sunday, the wife and me, on our way to services, when suddenly...
Ah, what's the use?
- Here you are, Dad.
- Eh?
Oh.
Thank you. Thank you.
You seem like nice people.
If you want a holiday in Scotland, go to Loch Lomond, go to Holy Loch, but stay away from Loch Ness.
To think that people still believe in that nonsense. Here, in the 19th century.
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I was relieved when he mentioned a father and two boys.
- It's nothing to do with Emile.
- It appears not.
However, there still remains the clue of the castle.
And the red runner, whoever he may be.
If they're unidentified graves, why are those boys bringing flowers?
Because it's their brothers who have been buried.
- Their brothers?
- They're not boys.
They're as tall as they'll ever grow.
Hand me some pebbles.
Pebbles?
Take a look at their faces.
They are...
How do you call them in English? Nains?
Midgets.
- Boys with the faces of old men.
- I still don't see wh...
- Would it help to know they're acrobats?
- Not at all.
Do you remember a tumbling act, six brothers missing from the circus?
That case you turned down?
I completely forgot.
Some of us are cursed with memories like flypaper.
Stuck there is a staggering amount of miscellaneous data.
Mostly useless.
Mr Holmes.
- If those are not children, then...
- Quite.
The question now is, who's in the third grave?
Holmes! She's fainted!
Hand me that lantern.
It is Valladon, isn't it?
Obviously.
But what is not so obvious is why his wedding ring has turned green.
And why there are three dead canaries in the coffin.
White canaries.
You've a lovely view of the loch from here.
As soon as the morning mist rolls away.
If you've a mind to go sightseeing, here's a guide to all the local points of interest.
Thank you.
This way, please.
I'll show you to your room.
I suppose you're putting me in the basement?
- No, your room's in the attic.
- Good.
It's the privy that's in the basement.
Oh.
May I have your wedding ring, please?
Just as I thought.
There is a distinct difference in colour between your ring and your husband's, which leads me to believe that the cause of death was not drowning.
I wish you would stop that.
Stop it!
If we are to continue, to find out what happened to your husband, you cannot act the grief-stricken widow.
I'm... sorry.
I know it's not easy, but remember we're a nice couple from London on holiday in the Highlands.
I'll try.
- That's much better.
- Thank you.
If I may proceed without further interruptions.
Mr Ashdown!
Mr Ashdown! Mr Ashdown!
Holmes, I saw it! I saw it from the attic window. It's out there in the lake!
- You saw what?
- Telescope. Where's the telescope?
What did you see?
- The monster!
- The monster?
There. There. There, there, there!
There it is! There it is!
Look for yourself. There it is.
There. There. There. See it?
There. See it?
I see nothing.
Nothing?
- It's gone.
- Maybe it was never there.
I swear to you,
I saw it as clear as anything.
Watson, as you so succinctly put it, we are living in the 19th century.
Maybe that gravedigger was right.
The swell, the boat overturning?
Valladon may have been in the lake but he did not drown. He died of asphyxiation.
Asphyxiation?
Only one substance can turn a copper ring green and bleach the colour out of canaries.
Chlorine gas.
Well, that may be, but the fact remains that I saw something out there.
A figment of your imagination.
Now, let us be logical.
The only concrete lead we have is the reference to the castle.
The question is... which castle?
You call yourself logical?
You're the least logical man I know.
Am I?
How can you say it's a figment of my imagination when for years you've been saying
I have no imagination whatsoever?
We have so far investigated eight draughty castles, had our bicycles attacked by sheep, our ears assaulted by bagpipes, and we are exactly where we started.
- Some more cranberry sauce, dear?
- Yes, dear.
- Pass the cranberry sauce, John.
- Yes, dear.
I say, there! Good afternoon!
Remember me?
There's some chaps I met on the train. We had a long conversation. Or, rather, I did.
Because they are not allowed to talk.
Trappists. Just study their bibles.
You'll never guess what the one next to me was reading. The book of Jonah.
- Isn't that odd?
- Quite.
- What is it, dear? What's the matter?
- Oh, a bee.
I don't think we have to bother with this castle. It's just a pile of rubble.
Then why are they taking all these precautions?
Why, indeed.
- Let's go.
- Go where?
When rebuffed at the front door, the only choice is to try the tradesman's entrance.
- Sorry. No visitors allowed.
- Are you the guide here?
- Yes. But the castle is closed for work.
- Why? What are they doing?
Restoration by the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments.
That's too bad. I wanted my wife to see Urquhart castle.
The tower is a most interesting example of medieval architecture.
- About 1400, wasn't it?
- That's right.
Let me see, was it built by James the Second or James the Third?
The Third. But if you'd like to come back next year we'll be finished and I'll be glad to show you round.
Thank you.
- Pleasant sort.
- Pleasant but ignorant.
He was off 100 years and one James.
It's actually 1500 and James the Fourth.
If he's an official guide, shouldn't he know?
If he's an official guide.
Listen. Do you hear anything, Watson?
No, those birds are making too much of a racket.
They're not just birds.
They're our old friends.
Sulphuric acid.
The more we find out the less sense it makes.
To a graduate chemist it makes a great deal of sense.
Sulphuric acid, when exposed to salt water, produces chlorine gas.
John, would you mind clasping your hands, please?
- Like that?
- No, like that. Lower.
Thank you.
That tower may be more interesting than I thought.
And not just architecturally.
Holmes. I have a feeling we're redundant here.
We have now observed it from the front, the back, the side, from land, from water.
- What now? Spend the night out here?
- If necessary.
You're going to catch your death of cold, you know.
Wouldn't it be ironic if Holmes' last case were a case of pneumonia?
Sorry.
What's that?
Holmes!
- There's...
- Quick, Watson! After it!
Holmes, what are we doing?
We should be going away from it!
- Keep rowing, dammit!
- Oh!
We've lost it.
At least you admit there is an "it".
Not just a figment of my imagination.
Quiet.
- Do you have your stethoscope with you?
- Never without it.
What is it?
I can hear something.
It's getting closer.
And closer.
Holmes!
Get back! Get back!
- Are you all right?
- I lost my parasol.
Where's Watson?
Watson?
Thank you.
I have come face to face with man-eating tigers.
I was once caught in a stampede of wild elephants. India, you know.
But I wasn't half as frightened. This beast seems to have a grudge against us.
I just hope it doesn't come back.
I don't think it will.
Look.
- What strange goings-on.
- Not really.
I would say that the monster, after a hard day's work, has returned home for his supper.
I know. Can you believe you can't borrow a decent pair of trousers in this place?
All right, Holmes. Want to confide in us?
When he whistles
I know he's close to a solution.
It's nothing new, actually.
We've come across this situation before.
- We have? Where?
- At the ballet.
There's a lake and there's a castle and there's a swan that isn't really a swan.
- Or a monster that isn't really a monster.
- Then what is it?
What is it indeed that feeds on canary birds and sulphuric acid
- and has an engine for a heart?
- An engine?
The stethoscope is a sensitive instrument and water is an excellent conductor.
There is no doubt that we are dealing with a mechanical monster.
Not only is it equipped with an artificial heart, it also has artificial lungs.
Judging from the bubbles on the surface of the lake, it uses some form of air pump.
You think my husband was involved in all this?
Yes, Madame Valladon, I'm sure of it.
Why would anybody build a mechanical monster? Just to scare people?
Not very likely.
Why did they try to keep me from finding my husband?
And why was he buried anonymously?
I think I have a pretty good notion of what they're up to, the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments.
- Better known as the Diogenes Club.
- The Diogenes Club?
Come in.
Mr Ashdown, I have a bottle of champagne for ye.
A bottle of champagne! I didn't order it.
No. You are to deliver it.
Those are my instructions.
Instructions from whom?
Deliver it where?
I wouldn't know, sir, but there's a carriage waiting for ye downstairs.
Are you sure you've got the right Mr Ashdown?
Quite sure, Mr Holmes.
Well, Watson, I would say the curtain is going up on the last act.
I don't like the sound of it.
Please be careful.
Holmes. You'd better take this with you.
Well. Who's minding the castle?
- You'd better get on. It's getting late.
- Where are we going? A party?
You won't be disappointed in the guestlist.
Who's the host?
Jonah.
Mr Ashdown, I presume.
The red runner, I presume. You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble just for me.
It's not for you. McKeller?
May I have the champagne, please?
1886. Not a very good vintage, is it?
Mediocre. Then again, it's not for drinking.
Tie it up, will you? In here.
Interesting... and educational.
Despite my warning you persisted in meddling.
- It would have served you right to drown.
- Sorry to be so unobliging.
"E Valladon". Hm.
I imagine that this belongs to the pretty lady and this belongs to your... valet.
- They were in the lake.
- Speaking of things in the lake...
How much do you know... or think you know?
I think you're testing some sort of underwater craft, camouflaged to mislead the gullible.
I think it's an experimental model operated by midgets.
It is powered by sulphuric-acid batteries and uses canaries to detect escaping gas.
- Altogether, a unique contraption.
- Not quite that unique.
Right now, four countries are trying to develop what we call a submersible, but none could solve the critical problem:
How to stay submerged long enough.
What does the Good Book say?
"And Jonah lived in the belly of that fish for three days and three nights."
That was our goal. Thanks to Valladon's air pump, we got a jump on the rest.
- It's a complex system, so we had trials.
- And at least one error.
During a run in the Moray Firth, pressure caused a leak, sea water mixed with acid in the batteries to produce chlorine gas.
Before they could resurface, three were dead.
So you buried them in unmarked graves to preserve your secret.
It was essential to keep it from your client.
You went to all those lengths to prevent
Madame Valladon finding her husband?
Your client isn't Madame Valladon.
It's the lmperial German Government.
They were after the Belgian engineer, or rather his invention.
They knew he was employed by us but couldn't find where.
So they enlisted the best brain in England to help them.
You, my dear brother, have been working for the Wilhelmstrasse.
And Madame Valladon, what part did she play in all of this?
- Madame Valladon is dead.
- Dead?
The Germans disposed of her three weeks ago. In Brussels.
This is Gabrielle Valladon.
The woman brought to you in the middle of the night, apparently fished out of the Thames and apparently suffering from amnesia is, in fact, llse von Hoffmanstal, one of their most skilful agents.
Am I going too fast for the best brain in England?
- Go on.
- They planted her on you quite neatly,
I must admit, so you could lead them to their objective, the air pump.
Very much like using a hog to find truffles.
And now perhaps you'd care to join me.
I'm expecting a certain royal personage from Balmoral.
Your Majesty.
I trust you had a pleasant journey, ma'am.
It was long and it was tedious and it had better be worth our while, Mr Holmes.
I can assure you, ma'am, it will be.
Now, what is this curious ship we are supposed to christen?
A submersible, ma'am.
It travels underwater.
Underwater? What a fantastic idea.
May I present some of the scientists responsible for this achievement.
- JW Ferguson, naval architect.
- Your Majesty.
Professor Simpson, our leading expert in hydraulics.
WW Prescott, coinventor of the revolving periscope.
- Your Majesty.
- And this is my brother Sherlock, ma'am.
Ah, yes, Sherlock Holmes.
- We've followed you with great interest.
- Thank you, ma'am.
Are you engaged in one of your fascinating cases now?
- In a manner of speaking, ma'am.
- When will we read Dr Watson's account?
I hope never, ma'am. It has not been one of my more successful endeavours.
Oh.
There she is, ma'am.
Her Majesty's Ship Jonah.
And what, may we ask, is the purpose of that hideous gargoyle?
- Merely a decoy, ma'am.
- Oh!
To frighten away the sharks, we imagine.
Something of the sort.
The crew will now demonstrate the workings of the submersible.
Stand to!
Aren't they rather small for sailors?
Because of the size of the craft, the navy made an exception.
They should make it a rule. It is quite fatiguing to pin on all those medals while standing on our toes.
This main engine propels it underwater at the rate of two knots.
The reciprocating stabiliser mechanism.
The high-voltage acid batteries.
The multistage compressor.
The ballast tank trimmer.
The air pump, which filters and recirculates the air.
- Oh, charming.
- The air pump, ma'am?
Canaries!
Must make the crew feel at home!
Yes, ma'am.
The levers for firing the torpedoes, which are accurate up to as much as 120ft.
The periscope for scanning the surface of the water.
- Where is the glass bottom?
- The what, ma'am?
- The glass bottom.
- You know, to observe the fish.
- And the plants and the corals.
- That's not quite the idea, ma'am.
HMS Jonah has been commissioned as a warship.
A warship.
Stop that noise!
Stop it!
- If I may explain.
- You had better.
The admiralty regards this as the ultimate weapon in naval warfare.
It can seek out and destroy enemy ships while remaining completely invisible.
You mean it can fire at other vessels while underwater? Without any warning?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Without showing her colours?
- Indeed, ma'am.
- Mr Holmes, we are not amused.
It is unsportsmanlike, it is unEnglish, and it is in very poor taste.
We will have none of it.
I beg your pardon, ma'am?
Sometimes we despair at the state of the world.
- What will scientists think of next?
- That's precisely it, ma'am.
At this very moment, the Germans are experimenting with a dirigible.
A dirigible? And what, pray, is that?
A rigid balloon which could drop a bomb on Buckingham Palace.
It is being developed at the express orders of Kaiser Wilhelm II.
Nonsense.
We refuse to believe that our grandson
Willie would do a thing like that.
We have proof, ma'am.
Our agent in Friedrichshafen, lbbetson, saw the dirigible and made a drawing of it.
However, he was apprehended before crossing the border.
Nevertheless, we want no part of this beastly invention. Get rid of it.
- Scuttle it. The sooner the better.
- May I point out, ma'am...
And do not concern yourself about that dirigible dropping bombs on us.
We shall write a very sharp note to the kaiser.
Now, we wish to return to Balmoral.
Well, Mycroft, it seems we have both been undone by a woman.
What a shame, all that superb engineering and all that cunning espionage for naught.
Not necessarily.
If the Germans want that submersible so badly, why don't we give it to them?
- Give it to them?
- Invite them aboard for the final journey.
700ft, straight down.
- And how are you going to arrange that?
- I'm rather counting on you to do it, since you're on such intimate terms with Fräulein von Hoffmanstal.
Shall we say goodbye to Her Majesty?
Sorry about that, but as long as you're up.
What is the German word for "castle"?
- Schloss, isn't it?
- I think so.
And how would you say
"under the castle"?
Unter das Schloss? Or die Schloss?
I don't know. My German is not that good.
Your Trappist friends are waiting outside to hear from you.
It's a chilly morning, we don't want to keep them standing around, do we?
Fräulein Hoffmanstal.
Come, now, it's too late to play cat and mouse.
Unter dem Schloss.
Thank you.
Here is your signaling device.
It's rather damp, I'm afraid.
Would you care to tell them where they can find the submersible?
No?
Then I shall just have to do it myself.
I only hope my Morse code is adequate to the occasion.
Well, it's up to the good monks now.
You can consider your part of the mission accomplished, Fräulein Hoffmanstal.
You're all wrong about me.
My name is not Hoffmanstal.
- It isn't?
- It's von Hoffmanstal.
I stand corrected.
I suppose once they are in the castle...
Must amuse you,
Trappists walking into a trap?
It's more amusing than that. Once inside, they will encounter little resistance.
It will take but a small bottle of chloroform to overcome the guards.
- You mean you'll give them the air pump?
- We'll give them the submersible.
They'll find it with its engines running, all set to go. I assume they're expert sailors.
Since there's a German battleship off the coast,
I expect they'll try to sail it out of the loch and rendezvous at sea.
Did you say "try to"?
I would suggest you get your things together.
Mycroft will be here to take you into custody.
I never had you fooled for a moment, did I?
You knew right from the beginning.
When the cabby brought me to Baker Street.
Let me see...
Not quite that soon.
It's so funny. I asked for this assignment, you know.
I was scheduled to go to Japan, but I couldn't resist the challenge of coming up against the best.
I'm sorry I didn't give you a closer game.
Close enough.
You're just being kind. I failed miserably.
We all have occasional failures.
Fortunately, Dr Watson never writes about mine.
Holmes! Holmes!
Holmes!
Holmes! I saw it again!
That thing!
It came to the castle. It's out there.
It was out there. Now it's gone.
- It's gone?
- Forever. Look for yourself.
A bottle of champagne?
And a bible?
That's all that's left of HMS Jonah.
Holmes! For once, would you mind being a little less cryptic?
It would seem that someone carelessly loosened the bolts of the submersible.
What a fitting end for Trappists.
Now they're resting in eternal silence at the bottom of the lake.
Do you know what he's talking about?
Fräulein von Hoffmanstal.
Yes, Mr Holmes, I'm all ready.
One thing I like about the Prussians is their punctuality.
If there's one thing I dislike about the British, it's their climate.
I understand your jails are very damp and your heating facilities totally inadequate.
They are, but you're not going to jail, you're going back to Germany.
- Germany?
- You'll go to the Swiss-German border and be exchanged for one of our agents, a man named lbbetson.
- Thank you.
- Thank my brother. It was his idea.
Frankly, I think we're making a poor deal.
You're better than most operatives working for British intelligence.
Don't you agree, Sherlock?
And better than some consulting detectives.
Shall we?
I'll take that.
Gentlemen.
You don't have to explain if you don't want.
- I appreciate that, Watson.
- I'm only your official biographer.
I don't think she would care to have this story spread all over the Strand Magazine.
The public has a right to know these things.
If she's a German spy, why should we concern ourselves about her feelings?
Giddap.
Look, Holmes, if I promise not to write a word about it, would you enlighten me, as your friend, as your valet?
Quiet. I'm trying to read a personal message.
Message?
What's she saying?
Auf...
Wiedersehen.
Auf Wieder... The nerve!
Hm!
- A letter from the Diogenes Club.
- Maybe Mycroft put you up as a member.
If only to have the distinct pleasure of blackballing his brother.
Aren't you going to finish your breakfast?
Holmes, I'm terribly sorry about this.
Where is it, Watson?
In the files. May to July 1885.
You're getting better.

Planet Jilutia
The planet of Jilutia was dying.
This planet was once beautiful and full of life but the Empire of Gabanas had attacked them and taken over, and Jilutia became their for-tress.
Kido, the leader of Jilutia, had his sixty soldiers fight the Gabanas army but they were hopeless against them.
The holy spirit of Universe, please forgive my mistakes and bring a miracle to help us.
These eight holy seeds will seek out eight brave warriors, and let these brave warriors bring forth a miracle.
Let the miracle happen. To the far reaches of the universe!
Emerarida
Yes, grandfather.
Follow those Reyabe seeds.
You must leave at once. When you find and bring the eight brave warriors here, we shall be saved.
Yes.
Master!
Please let me go with her so I can protect her.
Oh, yes, ifa strong man like you accompanies her, then I am confident you will succeed in the quest.
If anything happens to Emerarida, you must continue with the quest no matter what. Understood, Uroooo'?
Yes, sir!
Emerarida, Never forget that the people of
Jilutia's destiny rests on your shoulders.
Yes, grandfather, I understand.
Gabanas Fortress
We have not had such a storm for a long time. It kind of feels good.
Your majesty!
Wh at?
Yes, one of the Jilutian spaceships is attempting to escape.
Whatl?
Please come and see for yourself.
They are trying to find some help from other planets.
But I'm sure there is nobody in this universe who would go against me.
No, don't be so sure about that.
This infinite universe reaches far and wide. Anything could happen.
Oh, mother, you worry too much.
No. I saw eight glowing Reyabe seeds fly away into the sky.
Wh at?
Reyabe seeds are the sacred guardians of Jilutia.
If nothing is done about this, something terrible could happen to us.
Destroy that spaceship immediately.
Urocco! Are you OK?
This is nothing to me
Planet Milazeria
In this time of the era the Earthlings were exploring other planets within the Milky Way galaxy to find resources and land to inhabit.
Captain! Captain!
What is it, miss?
What is that?
Huh? Oh, that is an asteroid belt.
It is well known around Milazeria.
No, not that.
You see, those twinkling things that look like clouds or something.
Oh, I see, they are called "fireflies of space".
Fireflies of space...
Yes.
Fireflies of space...
Fireflies of space...
I've never seen them before. I didn't know there were fireflies in space.
How romantic!
Their name might sound romantic, but they are actually just radioactive dust particles.
So it's a famous characteristic of the asteroid belt but the belt itself is made out of nuclear waste, kind of like a glowing garbage dump.
Pilot! What's going on?
I'm sorry, but some stellar hot-rodders have disrupted our flight path.
Whatl?
What are they thinking? What if we collided?
Call the space patrol and have them arrested.
Yes, sir!
How cool!
Yahoo!
Hey Captain, hurry up and follow them.
But wait miss. Here, please have a seat.
Forget you, I'll be the driver!
No way!
Let me go.
Ifl let you drive then I would be fired.
Please!
No!
If you don't hurry we'll lose them!
Let go of me!
Hey Shiro, this is so much fun!
I'm glad we left earth to come fly around.
Yeah, do you want to bet?
What do you want to bet?
How about a gold coin?
Do you even have a gold coin?
D0 you?
Uh-Oh
Oh, no, it's a cop!
Warning! Breaking the space traffic law costs you more than just fines!
Do you understand?
Screw that! I'm not following the law!
Hey, if you don't like what I do, then I dare you to "Chicken Run"
Chicken run? What the heck is that?
Cops around here don't even know "Chicken Run"!?
Fly straight towards the ground and whoever pulls up the farthest from the ground is the "Chicken".
Lefs go!
Oh my god!
Hold on!
Of course!
Here we go!
Going through the tunnel next!
All right! Bring it on!
Thafs what you get!
Oh, no!
Hey I won! Don't forget about the gold coin.
Shoot, this was our first flight in this ship and now we've crashed.
Stupid engine!
What is this'?
Aaron, I found one in my engine compartment, too.
Milazeria Command Center
Salute!
This is so stupid!
I don't get the point of this.
Our commander must have gone crazy.
If earthlings find out about this, we'll be in trouble.
Good-bye, Beba, my old friend.
Rest in peace.
This is Gulda. What is it?
Emergency call from the command center.
Gulda! What was just launched? What was it for?
It was a funeral.
A funeral?
To remember a soldier we once had, I ordered it.
What? Who are you talking about?
Beba the 1st... my robot.
A robot?
You wasted one of our important rockets on a robot?
Yes, he was a robot but also my friend for thirty years.
I could not stand to see him reduced to scrap.
You idiot!
Have you gone mad, Gulda?
You're fired, leave here right now!
I would be happy to.
I have no regrets leaving such a corrupt military.
Good-bye, general.
Beba #2, are you ready?
Yes, master. I found these at a secondhand store.
I see, at a secondhand store.
This will do.
A perfect outfit for a man who no longer has any attachment to the military.
Don't you think, Beba #2?
I don't keep up with fashion trends!
Hey bartender, give me another one.
Yes, right away.
Oh, master, please do not drink too much.
We still have to find a place to stay tonight.
Ah, Beba #2, don't worry so much or else...
I'll send you off in a rocket.
You can't do that to me!
OK, OK, just one more Beba, just one more.
Huh?
Hey, what is this?
Did you put this in my drink?
What? No.
I wonder what kind of seed it is.
This is very peculiar.
This Milazarian drink tastes just like scotch.
It's because you drank too much and can't taste anymore.
Don't talk to me like your my wife.
Ah! Damn it!
Hey, Jack! Jack!
Yes, yes, yes.
You remember that money I had you put away? Bring it here!
Yes, sir! Uh, well...
I need cash right this minute, hurry up and bring it!
Well, I...
What are you waiting forl?
I'm so sorry!
Ouch, ouch, please forgive me!
Are these guys the ones you loaned that money to?
Yes, yes, yes!
You punks!
The money you borrowed from this guy belonged to me.
This idiot tried to make extra money off of it by charging interest. You understand?
Yeah, I understand.
If you understand, then bring all the money back to me in thirty minutes.
If you are late even a minute, or a second, I will sink all of you in quicksand!
Hey, you heard him, hurry up and give me back that money! Hurry!
This is too sudden.
You said we could pay you back little by little by working part time!
Well, just give me what you have and
I will come up with the rest somehow.
We used it all to buy a new machine.
Whatl?
Upgrading the machine was expensive.
We had to order the parts from Earth.
You idiots!
We're all going to be sent to the quicksand!
What have you done!
What the heck is this? This is a huge seed to come out of a tomato.
Aaron.
Yeah, it is the same thing that we found.
Hey! Aaron! Shiro!
Mayan!
I was looking all over for you guys.
What are you doing here?
I was on a star cruiser and I played a joke on the pilot.
He panicked and crashed the ship.
That's why you are here?
Well, yes, they told me I had to get out of the cruiser for a while until they could repair it.
Hey, who is this chick?
She's our friend from pilot school on Earth.
Oh, yeah, Mayah, yourfamily is wealthy, aren't they?
Well, yes.
Great! Would you loan us a little money for a while?
Wh at fo r?
We borrowed thirty gold coins from a gangster to build a new machine.
Now they say we have to pay them back right away, otherwise they would kill us.
Thirty gold coins?
Yes.
All right.
Wait, wait, wait! There is only one condition.
You have to help me catch space fireflies.
Space fireflies?
Yes, on my way here, I saw space fireflies outside the window of the ship.
I want them.
Oh, no, we can't. We're not allowed to be out there.
If we get caught, we'll go to jail for at least three years.
Fine. If you don't want to help me, I won't lend you the money.
Well, then we will do it!
I'm not going to let those gangsters kill us over a little bit of money.
Me, too. I will do whatever you want me to.
I'm telling you, we're not supposed to go out there!
Damn it! I'm not letting them get away this time!
There they are.
This is officer Fox, I have found the hot-rodders near the asteroid belt.
I'm going to arrest them!
Stupid cop!
Lefs go!
Damn! Do they think this is some kind ofjoke?
If we get caught, we'll be in jail for 3 years!
I don't think so! I'm a good enough pilot to avoid the police!
In fact, I'm pretty good. I was well known as "Kamikaze Mayah" back on Earth.
Here we are. Lefs go Jack.
Oh, please. Please don't make me do this.
You can stay here if you want to. But I heard there are space monsters around here and they would come and eat you.
Whatl? No way, please wait for me.
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Here we come.
This is not good.
I can't believe these guys.
Hey Mayah, it's networking.
They die as soon as I catch them.
You have to catch them alive!
If you don't then
I'm not going to lend you the money.
Okay, okay. We'll try.
Hey, look at that!
What is it'?
I wonder what it is.
Lefs go check it out.
Okay. Yo, Mayah, lefs go!
Hey, what is that?
Shut up, we'll see.
Is anybody here?
This is a ghost ship.
Lefs go see the inside.
Are you sure it's okay?
You chicken! If you're so scared then go back and wait in the ship.
What is it'?
Somebody's on the floor!
Are they dead?
Wow... She's beautiful.
I wonder what happened to them.
They must have been attacked by space monsters.
I don't like this at all. We probably should go back.
Wow, this engine's not from our Solar system.
Wh at?
Are you sure about that?
Yeah. I know everything there is to know about these machines.
They use this sail to convert light into energy.
That means these people could be from a different Galaxy.
Possibly.
What the heck is that?
What kind of ship is that?
They are alive!
Who are you people?
Princess Emerarida!
Hurry, this way!
Hurry UP!
Come on!
Oh, man, ifs crazy out there.
Of course it is. Their shipjust got blown up.
Should we call the police?
You crazy fool! Then they would know that we were in a prohibited area.
We would go to jail for three years. JAIL!
I'm so sorry.
We caused you trouble.
Oh, yeah, we almost got killed because of you.
You caused us a lot of trouble!
Jack!
Shut up! What do chicks know?
What's going on? It's noisy out there.
Shhhh, The owner of this place is back.
They are arguing about something.
Anyway, I'm not going to let this go.
You will have to pay for this.
Pay What?
Money, you know, MONEY!
Stop it, Jack. How embarrassing.
Just shut up and stay out of this, lady!
You be quiet!
Don't pick on herjust because she's a woman.
What? What did you just say to me?
Ow, ow, ow!
Go, lady!
Shhhh.
You hit mel? How dare youl? Come on, you guys!
Go get him!
Come on, guys, just kill them!
As you wish.
Urocco, wait!
Please let me. They're bad men.
No, they're not.
They are the brave warriors of Reyabe.
Wh at?
Please forgive us.
Does it hurt?
Please take this.
No way.
The brave warriors of Reyabe must be sophisticated and noble.
Such foolish and cowardly men could never be them.
Don't you have any faith?
These holy Reyabe seeds have sought out these people.
Who are you?
Excuse me, but I was tired so I stopped to rest here.
I'm harmless.
I could not help but over hear your conversation. I also have this seed.
I assume there is a story behind this.
Would you please explain it to us?
Yes, I will.
Everyone, please listen to me.
We, the people of Jilutia were living peacefully until the Gabanas Empire attacked our planet.
When I close my eyes I can still see the men, the women, the elderly and even small children fighting, bleeding, then finally dying.
When we could no longer fight against
Gabanas we prayed to our God for a miracle.
Our God then answered by giving these sacred Reyabe seeds the power to seek out eight brave warriors.
When these eight warriors are brought to Jilutia the miracle will occur, destroying the evil Gabanas Empire.
The prophecy will then be fulfilled.
I see. Nowl know the story.
But look at all of us.
I have experience in fighting wars, but do you even know how to use weapons?
Of course not. The last battle between planets ended the year I was born.
Right, Shiro?
Yeah, I don't even want to go to war.
How about you, tough guy? What do you think?
What do I think'?
Well, there will be only eight of us...
You would be better off to ask for help from Earths higher ranks.
What do you think?
You need young people in order to fight a war.
And if the young people are anything like them, then it would be hopeless.
Even if I try to fight for you I cannot do it alone.
I shouldn't keep this.
Beba, lefs go.
What is it'?
Look at that, master. Beba the
1st became a star and is in orbit.
It's over now. Lefs forget about it.
No, I cannot.
I will never forget your incredible kindness towards robots.
You are making me sober up. Here, lefs go. Hurry.
Master, why don't you help those people?
I'm sure Beba the 1st is wondering the same thing up in the sky.
Beba, I already left the military.
I cut all ties. I don't want to do anything anymore.
Lefs stop arguing and go find a place to sleep.
Princess Emerarida, let's leave here to find the rest of those four brave warriors.
There must be real brave warriors of
Reyabe somewhere who would fight for us.
Yes, you are right.
Wait. Please don't go yet.
Aren't you guys real men? Don't you want to help them?
Shut up! We were just discussing how we can help.
Okay, guys, you understand?
Well, but...
No "buts" Think about it, if we lose this chance, we'll be sent to die in the quicksand. I'm going.
Okay, I will at least show you where the rest of them are.
What? You mean you know other people who posses Reyabe seeds?
Well, yeah. They are not like us but hunters who hunt Milazerian wolves.
They would be perfect for fighting against the Gabanas Empire.
Jack, I'm so proud of you!
Oh, yes, I have seen this before.
Some guys who came to buy liquor from me wore the same seed as a good luck charm.
What? ls that true?
Yes, I'm sure of it.
They were very unusual seeds and I got a close look at them.
I remember this very well.
Princess Emerarida, this is good news.
Yes, lefs go find them.
You can't go, miss.
It's too dangerous for you.
They are on the move year round tracking the Milazerian wolves.
You cannot travel by jeep to find them. It's not that easy.
Do you have any idea where to find them?
Well, of course it would be somewhere you can hear the wolves howling.
Take us there, will you?
Right now?
Yeah, we will pay you.
It's already dark outside. Why don't we wait until tomorrow morning?
No, no, that won't work. We just heard wolves howling near here.
If we wait until morning and the wolves move on, then they would move on, too. They're in a hurry.
Please.
It's still too dangerous for a woman.
The mountain roads around here are very rough.
I will go by myself.
Please wait here, princess Emerarida.
If you really want to go now...
Hikiroku!
Come down here.
Would you take them up the mountain?
Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.
No problem. When we need help, we need to help each other.
It's cold at night in the mountains, so drink this before you go.
Thank you so much for everything.
Urocco... please be careful.
IWill.
Don't worry. My son is a very experienced guide.
You tricked us!
Of course I did. I got that old hag to slip a drug in your drink. Now die!
Huh! What took you so long? Here, pay up.
Well done, son. It must have been cold outside.
Come over here and have a drink.
What happened to Urocco?
He won't be coming back.
Here, don'tjust stand there.
Go sit by Hikiroku and pour him a drink.
Are you deaf?
What are you doing to me?
What am I doing? I paid a lot of money to make you Hikiroku's wife.
Wh at?
No!
What is that look for?
How dare you be so rude just because of how he looks.
This is my son that I gave birth to on Pluto.
Hikiroku, hurry up and make her yours.
Damn you! You just won't listen.
Teach her a lesson.
You killed my son!
Take her away!
Yes, sir!
Here, take this old woman, too.
Yes, sir!
Princess Emerarida!
Princess Emerarida!
Princess Emerarida!
Princess Emerarida!
Jack, how does it feel to do something nice for a change?
It feels great!
Were they happy to find the brave warriors of Reyabe?
Of course.
So what happened? What did they do?
They went to kick some ass. A big space ship came to pick them up.
And you guys are still here?
So what.
That's a shame. You guys are also brave warriors of Reyabe.
I know, I know.
You don't know anything.
Why don't you go help them?
Go where?
To Jilutia, in the Andromeda nebula, of course.
How do we get there without a spaceship?
It's two million light years away. We can't even go one.
Why don't you build one then? I will pay for it!
Oh, I have a great idea. You could upgrade my spaceship and attach both of yours to each side.
They could detach in an emergency. We can build the most awesome machine together!
That is a great idea! I always wanted to build something like that.
What, are you stupid? Don'tjump on it so easily.
What's wrong with you, Aaron.
You're acting kind of strange.
It's okay, ifs okay. Here, lefs dance.
Urocco!
I'm not going to forgive you! I'm going to kill you!
Shame on you, Jack.
Ha! I wasn't the only one.
They made some money, too.
We knew you would just complain if you found out.
What?
Is that true?
Tell me the truth, Aaron!
Shiro, is that true?
Do you believe their story, Mayah?
That these seeds have the divine power to seek us out from across the universe?
Hey lady, don't look so sad.
Even if the story is true, it's two million light years away.
We can't really do anything for them anyway, no matter how much we care.
You jerks!
Sorry we're such jerks.
I'm not like you,
I hate war and heroes, I'm just a punk.
My father died during war while your father profited from it.
And you're his little princess.
Aaron...
But it doesn't matter. I hate it when people order me around.
You can't make me do anything either.
Stupid seed!
What are you doingl?
You should throw yours away, too, Shiro.
I hate you all!
Emerarida!
Where did you go?
Emerarida!
Do you know where Emerarida is?
Hey! What are you doing to me?
Emerarida! EMERARIDA!
It's too late!
She's going to die now.
Or do you want to die, instead?
NO! I'm an Earthling.
I have no relation to you or to her.
You liar.
You're in love with her.
No, I don't love her.
Ifl did, I wouldn't have sold her out!
But you did.
For a little bit of money, you sold her.
Now look what you've done.
Nooooo!
Hey kid, what's wrong?
What happened?
Oh, no. We have nothing to do with this kid.
Please help us. Help!
You cowards! You weaklings!
Jilutia, forever!
Whafs wrong?
No... nothing.
This is a Reyabe seed.
I wonder why this came back.
I don't know.
I don't know, but... What am I feeling?
Look...the Reyabe seed found me, too.
Where's yours, Aaron?
Aaron, you...
Don't worry, yours will come back soon.
It has to. All of ours came back.
Shut up! I'm not a little kid.
Forget those stupid things.
Just be quiet. I can't sleep.
Master!
Their battleship has just returned.
Well, well, well. Welcome. I always wanted to have a chance to speak with you.
I don't have anything to discuss with you people.
You Gabanasian people tore apart our peaceful planet with your evil claws, took our Southern winds and Sunlight away from us, and turned our planet into a cold, dark place.
But that was not my intention.
You must know that I wanted to leave Jilutia as beautiful as it was.
Jilutia became that way only because your people Kept fighting us even though there was no chance for them.
Are you suggesting that we forget about our pride and start living like prisoners?
If so, then every last one of us would rather fight and die until the very end.
Nobody in the universe can take
Jilutia's dream away from us.
Take her away.
Yes, sir.
Are you keeping her alive?
She might still be useful to us...
Excuse me, my lord.
What is it'?
We brought you another souvenir.
This is an intelligent life form from elsewhere in the solar system.
I thought we might be able to extract information from it.
Wh at?
Are you saying there are other civilizations in the Solar system?
Yes. Please look at this.
I believe these are its childhood memories.
I'm so tired.
I feel like I've traveled from one end of the universe to the other for hundreds of years.
I'm really tired.
I want to go home. I want to go home to Earth.
What happened?
Show me more.
Yes, but I'm afraid it's injured and if we continue this it will die.
I don't care.
Yes, sir.
It's beautiful.
I've never seen a planet as beautiful as this.
What's the name of this planet?
Yes, it is called “Earth”, the third planet of the solar system.
Earth...
Yes.
Its life has just ended.
Mother.
Don't you think Earth would be a perfect planet for us to build our Kingdom from which to conquer the universe?
Ithink so.
If we succeed, you will be the biggest king in all of history.
But I still worry about whatever became of those Reyabe seeds.
Don't you worry about it, mother.
It's already taken care of.
Well, then, you must act quickly and give the order to invade Earth.
As long as we have this big planet for our for-tress, we needn't worry no matter what the Earthling defenses are.
Master! The sky! The sky is moving!
No, it's not the sky.
It's our planet Jilutia that has started moving.
Right after that, a military observatory on Earth detected a mysterious planet rapidly heading towards them from the Andromeda nebula.
They then received a message from Roxaiah the 12th demanding them to surrender.
But the Nations of Earth refused to meet his demands and launched
3 of their battle ships to intercept the Gabanas attack.
Launch fighters!
Launch!
Fire ultra nuclear missile!
Firing missile!
Fine.
I order all of you to prepare for battle.
The government leaders of Earth were shocked by the fact that all three battleships were destroyed during the attack.
They felt responsible for the loss and all agreed to resign from their positions.
The opposition party of Earth established a new council of delegates to replace the former officials, and Ernest Noguchi became the council's leader.
Where is he?
We looked everywhere for him and finally found him. But he seems to be very intoxicated.
General Gulda. Long time no see.
Noguchi! Oh, excuse me, President Noguchi.
Congratulations on your recent promotion.
I'm so proud that one of my childhood friends has become a leader of the planet.
It's very ironic that my council was established due to the Gabanas attack, yet at the same time we are in danger because of it.
So much responsibility you have.
But the Eartns future or politics has nothing to do with me any more.
Well, listen to me.
I will do anything to overcome this danger.
What do you think, would you attack Gabanas
Empire as my ambassador extraordinaire.
An ambassador extraordinaire.
Me?
They are demanding our unconditional surrender, and require that we answer within three days.
I want you to extend it as long as you can.
I see.
You need extra time to get ready for the attack.
By the way, why did you pick me for such an important task?
Do you remember the nickname
I gave you when we were little?
Yes, I do.
Don Quixote.
That nickname is why I appointed you.
There is no one else who can fight against a giant enemy with nothing but a spear.
No, that's not true.
Even ifl can buy us some time, there is no way you can win against them.
Do you even know the condition of our military right now?
Generals are into politics, and soldiers are used to living peacefully.
It shoudn't even be called a military.
That was why I left. I can't help you.
Don't you want to save the Earth, and our peoplel?
How dare you forget your pride as a great general!
I'm no longer a general.
I gave up on myself. I died.
Beba the 1st is in the sky...
And so am I.
Holy seed... you really want me to...
What is wrong Gulda?
You wouldn't believe this story.
My dream...
It's just come back to me.
Beba!
Yes, master!
Get ready.
We're leaving to the Gabanas Empire as an ambassador extraordinaire.
Yes, sir!
Mayah, I wonder why the Reyabe seed hasn't come back to him yet.
It doesn't want to come back if he is acting that way.
He's such a sissy.
Urocco!
What are you doing? I told you to stay in bed.
No, I can't.
I have to find all eight brave warriors of Reyabe, otherwise we can't destroy the Gabanas Empire.
I must go and find them.
What can you do injured?
We already have so much to worry about, please don't give us more.
Hey there!
Well, it's amazing. A drunken soldier told me that the story about Jilutia is really true.
A great man from the Earth came to tell them that they are going to Jilutia.
Wow. We have to hurry and finish building our ship so that we can go, too!
Hey! Shiro!
Where are you going?
Aaron, please.
Think it over again and help us.
Shut up.
Why don't you think it over?
Do you still believe in a fairy tail?
Do you think a man like you can be a hero?
Aaron... I understand how you feel.
You like Emerarida, don't you?
What the heck are you talking about?
I don't have time for these childish games.
I'm going to take a nap.
Why don't you get out of here.
You are in so much denial, Aaron.
Piss off!
Screw you!
Shiro!
Hey you guys, stop m
Aaron, Shiro, please stop!
This is no time to fight against each other.
Shiro!
Hey, stop!
It's Gabanas! Run!
Oh my god!
Ahhhh! Help me, please!
Jack!
Aaron! It's too dangerous to go by yourself!
You Idiot! They captured Jack!
We have to do something.
If you go by yourself, you will just get killed.
Shut up! Don't worry about me!
Get out of my way!
Aaron, Aaron, look at this!
It came back!
See, your Reyabe seed came back to you, too.
This must be a sign that we all have to work together.
Now Aaron, lefs go build that ship.
We'll arrive at Jilutia in twenty minutes.
We should each get in position now.
Yeah.
Okay.
Aaron, Shiro, get ready to detach.
All right!
I'm ready when you are!
Oh, no!
Whafs going on?
I'm losing control!
I wonder where we are.
According to my calculations, we're on a small planet in the Bernard system.
Damn it! Why would the Reyabe seed cause us to crash here?
Damn!
You're right. If we would have kept going, we could have rescued Jack by now.
Hey, did you hear that noise?
What is that?
It's a Gabanasian!
Wh at?
Watch out!
Urocco!
How rude!
You just start attacking me without first introducing yourself. Are you a thief? Orjust plain crazy?
I will kill you in honor ofJilutial
Wait, look! He's a brave warrior of Reyabe, too!
My name is Hans. I'm originally a prince of the Gabanas Empire.
My mother and father were killed by the evil Roxaiah.
And I came to live here.
I've been waiting for a chance to seek my revenge.
It's my destiny to follow this Reyabe seed.
I would be happy to fight along side of you.
But that would mean you are going to be fighting against your own people.
Are you okay with that?
I will fight against my own people in order to bring justice to the universe.
I will have no regrets.
Now it all make sense.
The Reyabe seed caused us to crash here so that we would find prince Hans.
Yes, I think so, too. Lefs go to Jilutia.
Earth...
You disturb my mind and drive me crazy.
Vvny?
Is it because you are so beautiful?
Tomorrow is the third day.
But the Earthlings have said nothing to us.
What are you going to do?
Don't worry, mother.
I don't think the Earthlings have enough courage to save the planet.
Your majesty.
An Earthlings' spaceship is getting closer. They are requesting a meeting.
Finally.
Give them permission to land.
Emperor Roxaiah, grand empress Dark,
I'm honored to meet you.
You have come a long way. Make yourself at home.
We have a gift for you.
Here.
Yes, sir.
Enter!
Damn you! You're going to kill me, aren't you?
Do it! Kill me now! I'm also a brave warrior of Reyabe, I'm not afraid to die!
General!
I'm going to die! Help me!
You laugh at us.
You! What's so funny?
You ridicule my people.
This is unacceptable. I can't forgive such an insult.
I challenge you right now!
Let us fight!
Wait. General Gulda.
You're here as an ambassador of the Earths government.
How rude of you to start a personal fight in front of me.
I don't think it's rude at all.
On Earth when a person is insulted he has a right to redeem himself.
Of course he can refuse to fight, but then he will be known as a coward.
All right then. I will allow you to fight.
Lazzar! Fight!
Yes, your majesty.
You have only one shot each.
Both of you take 10 paces, then turn and fire.
Begin!
He cheated!
Beba. Stay out of this.
Nine... ten.
You're a disgrace to the Gabanas
Empire. Dispose of him immediately!
Pardon me emperor, butjust as you
Gabanasians value your reputation, there are also people on Earth who value their reputation more than their own lives.
For those people, your request for them to surrender is equally disgraceful.
Just lil<e on Jilutia where they keep fighting Knowing there's no chance for them, this blue Earth will be turned into a planet of death.
If there is a chance for me to persuade the people of Earth not to fight and die so senselessly, would you allow me a little more time?
You want more time to prepare for the battle don't you?
Well done.
I almost fell for your trick.
You're right, Earth is too beautiful to be destroyed.
But, how about that little star you call "the moon"?
Listen, you have until tomorrow to surrender.
If you don't, the same thing will happen to your precious Earth.
Leave now!
He's one of the brave warriors of Reyabe.
Are you sure it's wise to let him go?
Beba.
Yes, master.
We are going back to Jilutia.
What? But why?
We are going to defeat the Gabanas Empire.
Roger.
General Gulda.
What are you doing?
Tell the president that Don Quixote has returned.
"Don Quixote has returned?"
He will understand what I mean.
Now we shall go to face the giant.
Lefs go, Sancho Panza. Don't fall on top of me.
Okay, lefs go.
Yes master!
If you're scared, you don't have to come. See you later!
Oh... shoot, I'm a brave warrior of
Reyabe, too! Hurry, help me put this on!
If we fly straight ahead, their radar will detect us.
Do you have any ideas?
Don't worry. We planned ahead. Right?
Yeah. Okay.
This is Shiro, I'm ready.
Yeah, me, too!
Okay, commence operation "Chicken Run" Go!
We have an intruder in sector three!
Wh at?
Red alert!
Stand by to detach!
Fire!
They hit the ground. It could have possibly been a meteorite.
Aaron, Shiro, prepare to reattach.
Reattachment complete!
Lefs land, Mayah.
Urocco, here we are.
Yes.
Is anybody there? ls anybody there?
This is Urocco. I have brought with me four of the brave warriors of Reyabe!
He)' YOU guys! lt's me! lt's me!
It's Jack!
Jack!
General!
I knew you would come.
Who is this?
Prince Hans. He too is one of the brave warriors of Reyabe.
I see. It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Now we have Six Don Quixotes. Right, Beba?
Just two more to go.
By the way, too bad I'm only a robot.
Don't say that. Come on, lefs go.
Please look at this.
This is the central reactor core that powers the whole planet.
And blowing up this reactor is the only way to destroy the Gabanas fortress.
Since it's their only weakness it's very heavily guarded.
Our military has tried to destroy it several times before, but every previous attempt has failed.
But if you blow up the reactor core, it would destroy not only Gabanas but also Jilutia itself.
Yes, I am aware.
But I'm still asking you.
Please blow up this reactor core!
Master! That's crazy.
Urocco. Please understand.
Our mother planet should be put to rest by our own hand.
It's the least we can do.
We decided while you were gone.
Is this true?
Is this true?
How could you!
Urocco!
What are you going to do?
There's an old spaceship over in the swamp.
Its engine should still work.
We can at least save the women and children.
Well, then, our only concern now is how to go about exploding the reactor core.
This spiral pipe is connected to the core but its diameter is only ten meters.
So, how will we get there?
The entrance from outside is much too heavily guarded.
To gain entry by that route is hopeless.
Hey, he says its diameter is ten meters.
Yeah, we might be able to make it.
You're right.
What are you going to do?
We're just going to fly our ship right through the pipe.
The Gabanasians wouldn't even think about a small ship flying inside of the fortress.
It's too dangerous. The pipe is too narrow.
If you make even one small mistake, you will die.
Ha! We're not your standard military pilots.
Thafs right, we flew through narrow tunnels back on Earth all the time.
There's no other way, is there? Just leave it to us.
It might be the reason why the Reyabe seeds chose you.
Okay, it's worth a try. Study this map of the fortress interior and memorize its structural attributes.
What is that?
It's a Reyabe seed! Yay! Hooray!
What happened?
Please look at this.
It came to me, too. A Reyabe seed!
Oh, Beba! You're the seventh one!
Then the eighth one is... I wonder...
Drop your weapons!
Nobody move!
Drop the weapons. Everyone, drop the weapons.
Grandfather!
Emerarida!
Everyone, listen.
I knew about everything.
General Gulda, Prince l-lans, and those silly young fellows all posses the Reyabe seeds and would come before me.
You wonder why?
Well, there's a traitor amongst you.
You poor old man.
All of your soldiers have been captured by my army, and the miracle of Reyabe shall never occur.
I'll give you one last chance to end your hopeless fight.
If you surrender, I will guarantee the safety of you and your people.
It's true that your Gabanas Empire has defeated us.
But you can never take away our dreams!
I believe that as long as our dreams are kept alive the miracle of Reyabe will still occur, destroying Gabanas Empire once and for all!
You fool. You speak of a dream that can never come true.
Now you must die, by the hand of one of your own. Urocco!
Urocco! Why?
Don't look at me like that!
This was a hopeless war from the very beginning.
All we could do was to believe in some miracle!
And now you are about to destroy our own planet.
Without this land, there is no freedom or pride!
How many people have already died for this planet?
Iam... lam...
Urocco!
Mr. Urocco. This seed came to find a lowly robot such as me.
You know in your heart what you are doing is wrong.
Urocco! What are you waiting for?
I gave you a direct order.
Shoot. Betraying my master means betraying my own beliefs.
Roxaiah!
Shiro, over there! Over there!
Damn!
Beba, stay back. Hurry!
Urocco! Urocco! Urocco!
Look, Urocco, you're the eighth brave warrior of Reyabe.
Now all eight brave warriors of Reyabe have finally gathered. The miracle must occur.
Urocco!
Master!
We'll hold them off here. Please hurry and get the rest of them safely to the ship.
Quick, now's your chance!
All right!
Prince Hans, cover them!
Hey. What should I do?
I'll protect you.
Are you okay?
Yes. I don't feel pain.
You go ahead!
NOW!
Damn!
It's too bright and I can't see anything! Get rid of that light!
Leave it to me!
Okay, Lefs go!
Aaron, Shiro, are you ready for your ships to detach?
Standing by!
Yeah, go ahead!
Go!
Here they come!
Yahoo!
Aaron, Shiro, hang in there!
Onward! Onward!
Someone, hurry and start the engine!
Everyone, hurry up and get on board!
To the ship! Hurry!
Oh, no! Quick! Let me help you. Hurry up!
Please help me quickly.
Iam! Hurry, this way!
You have arrived Prince Hans.
Roxaiah, you bastard.
You not only killed my mother and father in order to steal the crown, but you also invaded the whole universe and turned it into a desolate place.
Your crimes deserve to be punished with death. Die!
Aaron, look at that!
There it is! Lefs go!
Shiro, We have to lose them!
Okay!
We did it!
That will teach you!
Everyone, please don't panic!
Help the children, quick!
It's going to explode! The planet is going to explode! Hurry!
Are you all right? Hurry, get on the ship!
Everyone, hurry!
Princess Emerarida! Our master is still down there!
Grandfather!
Emerarida, don't cry over my death.
The planet of Jilutia is my home.
L'll be turned to dust along with my own planet.
The young people must follow the
Reyabe seeds and start a new life.
Go and find a new land far away in the universe and grow your roots there.
Build a new kingdom, which will be filled with life, happiness and peace once again.
Good-bye!
Grandfather!
A battleship!
What are we going to do?
Well, one last chicken run!
Here, trade seats with me, Mayah.
Lefs go!
Everyone, hurry!
ONE!
TWO!
THREE!
Oh, they're awake.
Wow. We're alive.
Yes. The miracle of Reyabe has come true.
Thanks to you our people are safe.
I can't express enough gratitude.
We did it!
This is general Gulda. The Gabanas
Empire has been destroyed.
General Gulda. Thank you.
Myself, on behalf of the people of the Earth, appreciate all that you and your brave soldiers have done.
Please come home to Earth. We are also ready to welcome the people of Jilutia.
I deeply appreciate your concern.
But now we must leave to find a new home, to build a new kingdom.
It's all we can do to honor my grandfather and the others who have fought and died for Jilutia.
Emerarida, may I come with you?
In order to make amends for what my people have done,
I would be honored to assist you with building a new life for your people.
Please do.
Can I go with you?
Yeah, me, too!
Me, too!
But why would you want to come?
I'm beginning to understand our purpose in life.
How about you, Aaron?
Uh, well, I...
Even if we go back to Earth, we're just going to be chased by the cops. Right?
Yes, yes, I'm coming, too!
But I wonder if people like us can build a whole kingdom.
Of course you can. You're all brave warriors of Reyabe.
Yay!
Did you hear that?
To sow the seeds of new life far across the universe we're going to leave Earth.
Good-bye, Nogchi, my friend.
But it's too bad.
If we went back to Earth, even I might have been able to receive a medal.
The universe is infinite Beba.
We as individuals are so small compared to it, but at least our dreams can also be infinite.
Let us depart.
Onward!
Starboard!

THE END
How are you today? Hm?
You feeling good? Oh.
I bet you'd like something to eat.
Here. I've got something in my pocket here.
Some goodies. I'll set the table for you here, OK?
That's good.
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Do I have to put signs up here to keep you guys off my grass?
Hey, I'm sorry.
Hey! Get out of the way! Ya-hoo!
Whoo!
What do you think you're doing?
Ah-ha!
Whoo!
Look out!
Whoo!
Did you see the way that Lowell threw that rake at me?
- Why don't you lay off Lowell for a bit?
- We're just having a little fun.
Oh, yeah! Now what is this?
Really nice catch.
You guys are outrageous.
Listen, Wolfie, we've been here for six months.
We got six months more to go.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
He told me a story this morning about how they're gonna refoliate the earth.
Again?!
Let's set this thing up the way it was before, huh?
Oh!
It missed. It failed.
First time!
Let's stop playing with this thing, OK?
OK.
I'll tell you this for old flower-face, he sure knows how to play this thing.
Plenty of time to practise.
Hey, Lowell!
- How about a little of the old poker?
- Yeah. Later.
On this first day of a new century,...
.. we humbly beg forgiveness...
..and dedicate these last forests...
..of our once beautiful nation,...
..in the hope that they will one day return...
..and grace our foul earth.
Until that day,...
..may God bless these gardens...
..and the brave men who care for them.
- Three.
- Three.
Dealer takes one.
The deck's still open. Your bet, Barker.
And 100.
Guts.
Come on, son. Throw it on in.
I fold.
You bet $50 and then you're folding?
Right.
Well, boys, there's a three.
And there's another three.
And there are three big bullets.
I will just reach in and gather up the telepors.
- Beats me.
- You bet it does.
I wish they'd hurry up with that transmission. I wanna go to bed.
I suggest that you reach deep down inside yourself...
..and try and find something to keep you awake a little longer,...
..because this transmission coming up may just rekindle your will to live.
You think it'll be a recall?
Let's just say that
I feel my communications...
..may finally bear some fruit.
Mm. Cantaloupes, maybe.
I'll let that witticism slide by,...
..because it's my feeling that they're about to re-establish...
..the parks and forests system.
- With you as director?
- You can think of anybody better?
More qualified? Huh?
- Really, it's...
- No, wait a second.
Let me just ask him a question here.
I've spent my last eight years up here, dedicated to this project.
Now, can you think of anybody more qualified?
It's more likely that they're gonna announce cutbacks.
Sorry. There's no way they'll announce cutbacks, not after this amount of time.
Hey, Lowell, you're dreaming.
And you don't think it's time somebody had a dream again, huh?
You don't think that it's time that somebody cared enough to have a dream?
What about the forests? You don't think anyone should care about them?
What's gonna happen if these forests and all this incredible beauty is lost for ever?
It's been too long, Lowell.
People have got other things to do now.
Hi, this is for Valley Forge,
Berkshire, Sequoia.
This is Com Central. Channel open for executive order AUC3423.
Listen to this, boys.
This is Anderson speaking.
Boys, I have to make an announcement.
We have just received orders to abandon...
..and nuclear-destruct all the forests...
..and return our ships to commercial service.
I received no explanation...
..and we must begin at 0900 in the morning.
May God have mercy on us all.
- This is it! We're goin' home!
- I can't believe it!
- I told you! What'd I say?
- We pack up those domes and go home.
Destruct all forest units.
Kiss 'em goodbye, boys.
Hey, Lowell, I'm sorry.
It makes sense, you know?
It's insane.
Let's go.
Heels of children running wild
In the sun
Like a forest is your child
Growing wild
In the sun
Doomed in his innocence
In the sun
Gather your children to your side
In the sun
Tell them all they love will die
Tell them why
In the sun
Tell them it's not too late
Cultivate, one by one
Tell them to harvest
And rejoice
In the sun
How far out do they go before they blow?
About six miles.
We should feel a hefty jolt.
- I want a front-row seat when they go!
- I'll bet you do.
Lowell, do you have to eat that stuff in here? It stinks.
You never let up, do you?
Oh.
Now you hurt his feelings.
I'd like to know what any one of you knows about real food.
What do you mean, real food?
Out of the dirt? That's real food?
That's right. This happens to be nature's greatest gift.
To a celibate, maybe.
Come on, you guys.
Maybe he knows something we don't.
Lowell, give me a slice of that cantaloupe.
Don't ask Lowell for a slice.
I'd be delighted to give you a slice of it.
Just sit down and shut up.
Sit down. Sit down!
And shut up and leave me alone, all of you, and let me eat.
What's the big deal? I can't see the difference between that and this.
You don't see the difference?
The difference is that I grew it.
That's what the difference is.
I picked it and I fixed it.
And it has a taste, and it has some colour and it has a smell.
It calls back a time when there were flowers all over the earth.
There were valleys, and there were plains of tall green grass...
..that you could lie down in, that you could go to sleep in.
There were blue skies and there was fresh air.
There were things growing everywhere, not just in domes...
..blasted millions of miles out into space.
Look at that stuff. How can you guys sit there and say anything to me about this?
Look at this crap! Look at that!
Dried, synthetic crap!
You've become so dependent on it,
I bet you can't even live without it.
Why would we want to, Lowell?
Don't you realise how pitiful that is, what you just asked me?
On earth, everywhere you go, the temperature is 75º.
Everything is the same.
All the people are exactly the same.
Now, what kind of life is that?
- So why do you wanna go back?
- Because it's not too late to change it.
What do you want, Lowell?
There's hardly any more disease.
There's no more poverty.
Nobody's out of a job.
That's right. Every time we have the argument, you say the same thing.
You give me the same three answers.
"Everybody has a job."
That's always the last one.
But you know what else there is no more of? There is no more beauty.
There's no more imagination and no frontiers left to conquer. You know why?
One reason why. The same attitude that you guys are givin' me in this room today.
And that is: nobody cares.
Look on the wall behind you.
Look at that little girl's face.
I know you've seen it.
But you know what she's never gonna be able to see?
She's never gonna be able to see the simple wonder of a leaf in her hand,...
..because there's not gonna be any trees.
Now, you think about that.
If people were interested, something would've been done a long time ago.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm ready.
Hey, wait. Wait a minute. I don't think you guys understand what this means.
Please don't blow up the domes.
- Which one first?
- Outboard cluster first. Let's hit six.
- They're not disposable.
- I haven't got any choice, Lowell.
They're not replaceable.
Where's that tube?
- Ow! My hand.
- Hey, are you all right?
- You better get Lowell to fix that for you.
- Damn.
- Really.
- Yeah.
Will you help me?
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Get on in here now.
Valley Forge. Safe-distancing manoeuvre in five minutes.
Valley Forge, please stand by...
..for 1000 hours safe-distancing manoeuvre in five minutes.
I'm gonna need your help for that, you know, Lowell?
OK?
OK?
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Here.
Set gyro at 4406.
Set gyro to 4406.
This is Berkshire.
You there, Marty?
I'm on it, Neal.
OK, we're counting down for your 4406 distancing,...
..about 20 seconds.
- Set for distancing.
- Right.
Eight, seven, six, five...
..four, three, two, one. That's a go.
Thanks, Marty. We 're clear.
Stand by for updates.
Hey, Andy.
- The bomb, please.
- All right.
Loaded and ready to go.
99909 plus 49.
04 plus 8.
Right!
OK, looks real good. That's a go.
Hey, we're ready for some real fireworks here. 25 seconds.
We're looking forward to it, too, Neal.
Keep a steady hand, Marty.
Don't want one ofyou getting hurt.
Right. Will do.
Where the hell is Lowell now?
I think I saw him near One with some empty flowerpots.
That must be Berkshire.
Whoo!
- Do we need this?
- Huh?
Hey, Andy, easy with that.
No, we use the panel. It's safer.
- John, would you get those lights?
- Sure.
Nothin' up on the board.
- Well, set six.
- Gotcha.
- OK. Arm six.
- Armed.
Hit it.
No.
You're not comin' in here.
- What are you doin'?
- You're not comin' in here.
- Look, I know how you feel.
- If you knew how I felt,...
..you wouldn't be in here with that.
I'm on a tight schedule and I don't wanna fight.
I don't care. You are not using those things in my forest.
- I ain't got time to argue. Now, move!
- You're not gonna do it.
You can't blow up this forest.
Valley Forge.
Come in, Valley Forge. Reading 4040.
Berkshire to Valley Forge. Come in,
Valley Forge. Berkshire to Valley Forge.
Valley Forge. Come in, Valley Forge.
Reading 4040.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.
Come in, Valley Forge.
Valley Forge to Berkshire.
You still there, Neal?
- Yes. Barker?
- No, it's Lowell.
Oh, what's the trouble, Lowell?
We seem to be experiencing some kind of problem with the main coupling.
Oh, might be one of your squib pins severing.
That's what we figured it was,...
..so we've gone ahead and we're setting it now.
We'll be getting back to you just as soon as we can.
Roger.
- Lowell.
- Yeah?
- Everything OK over there?
- Oh, yeah, OK.
A-OK. Everything's OK.
We 'll wait to hear, buddy.
Roger.
Drone one,...
..drone two, drone three,...
..please report immediately to the main cargo area.
-  Berkshire to Valley Forge.
- Yeah, yeah.
Come in, Valley Forge. Berkshire to Valley Forge. Come in, Valley Forge.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.
Come in, Valley Forge.
Come in. Berkshire to Valley Forge.
Valley Forge to Berkshire.
Come in, Berkshire.
- How's it goin', Lowell?
- It's not goin' too well, Neal.
We're gonna have to torch those pins.
Better move on it, buddy.
Darkness coming up on you, 33201.
- Right. We'll try our best.
- Boys here are getting anxious for home.
Yeah, I understand.
Coming into darkness at 33201.
Right.
Blow it any old way you can, Lowell.
Big Billy wants to go.
We're tryin'.
Yellowstone, Arcadia, Blue Ridge,
Mohave report finaljettisons.
We got a hold on Valley Forge.
Right.
Berkshire to Valley Forge. You're entering darkness. Lowell, do you read?
- Right, Neal. We hear ya.
- Big Billy says blow it anyway, Lowell.
- Screw Big Billy.
- Didn't catch that, buddy.
Nothin'. I just said we're right on it, Neal. We're tryin'.
Valley Forge. What's wrong?
You're moving out. You're accelerating.
Valley Forge. Berkshire to Valley Forge.
I have an emergency ignition on Valley Forge, reading red 990.
I get a two-four on Valley Forge, reading red.
Valley Forge to Berkshire,
I've got an emergency.
- Neal? Can you read me, Neal?
- I read you.
I've got a main bus blowout on numbers three, eight and ten panels.
I've got a premature detonation on dome two and an explosion in the cargo deck.
Now, please advise me immediately.
I read you. Put on Wolf, Lowell.
No, change that. Give me Barker.
I can't find Barker or Wolf or Keenan either.
I'm afraid they might have been in dome number two.
God, dome two just blew up. Stand by.
Wolf, Keenan and Barker missing.
What the hell is taking so long?
Coming up now, Valley Forge.
Lowell, this is Anderson.
How are you, boy?
I'm OK.
Lowell, ifyou continue as is, we figure...
..you'll hit the northeastern quadrant of
Saturn's rings at 302 tomorrow morning.
- What does that mean?
- We don't think you'll make it through.
It's a very bad angle. These ships weren't built to shoot the rapids.
The plan is to find where the explosion chopped the main bus and re-route it.
You'll have to do some cutting.
Where do I start?
We tracked a bunch of cargo modules, probably offyour starboard side,...
..so we figure maybe one of the cryo tanks under the floor cut loose.
It may have exposed the main bus duct, if we're lucky.
I'll take a look at it.
Drone number one.
This'll stop 'em.
I need you guys to help me fix my leg.
From now on, you guys are working for me.
Here's a little medical program.
Drone one,...
..drone two, drone three,...
..please report immediately to surgery.
Drone number two,...
..you'll perform the operation.
Drone number three, you'll handle the oxygen anaesthesia.
Drone number one.
Number one, you'll assist.
Commander Anderson.
I can't get anywhere near that main bus duct.
Everything's just all torn up down there.
Listen, Freeman.
That's your first name, right?
Yes.
- Any family, Freeman?
- No, sir.
Well, listen, Freeman.
You've been with this project since the start, and you've known the risks.
Yes, sir.
I... I don't really know how to say this, Freeman.
It's all right, sir.
- We've got some trouble.
- I figured.
Yes. Um...
- I'm really sorry, Freeman.
- Sorry, sir? About what?
We 'll never be able to stop you before you hit the rings.
I see.
Freeman, you might want to consider...
Suicide, sir?
No.
I just don't think that I'd ever be able to do anything like that.
Well, the best we can do, then, is send out a search party the long way around.
But it's kind of like a needle in a haystack, ifyou know what I mean.
Yes, sir.
- Freeman?
- Yes, sir?
God bless you, Freeman.
You're a hell of an American.
Thank you, sir.
I think I am.
Drone number three.
Drone number three, keep moving.
Follow one and two.
Follow one and two!
Why didn't you follow them?
Now dig a hole for him.
Make it seven feet long... and three feet wide.
OK, now, put him... put him down in it.
And then remain there, cos I would like to say something...
..before you cover him over.
Uh...
I...
I would like to be able to say a prayer...
..but I don't...
..really know how to say it.
Wolf and Barker and Keenan,...
..they weren't exactly my friends.
But I did like them.
And, uh,...
..I don't... I don't think...
..that I'll ever be able to...
..excuse what it is that I did,...
..but I had to do it.
And...
I guess that's all that I have to say.
You can cover him over now.
Boys,...
..I'd like to make an announcement. Um...
From now on,...
..drone number two,...
..you will answer to the name of Huey.
And drone number one,...
..you will answer to the name of Dewey.
And little Louie, God bless him, he's...
..he's not with us any more.
Huey,...
..you take one step forward.
That's super.
Now, Dewey, you also take one step forward.
That's really excellent!
Now, um...
..you see, what I've done is,
I've reprogrammed both of you...
..so that now you'll respond directly to me.
You'll still run the same maintenance checks and perform the same duties...
..that you've been doing on the ship,...
..but you'll also be spending much more time with me in the forest.
And you shouldn't have much of a problem in making the necessary readjustments.
And I realise that...
.. we've really had a rough journey,...
..and we sure got our work cut out for us.
But I think that the three of us, together, as a team,...
.. we can manage OK.
Is that all right with you guys?
The three of us together are gonna plant a tree.
Trowel, watering can...
..and the tree.
Now, this is the mulch.
That's what makes the tree grow.
Now.
Now, Huey, you're gonna plant the tree...
..and, Dewey, you're gonna dig the ditch.
Now, we're gonna do it right here on the side of the hill.
That's a real good hole, Dewey.
Now,...
..Huey, here's the tree.
Put a little mulch.
There. OK. Now, plant the tree.
That's pitiful. Pitiful!
That's exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to be.
Earth between my toes and a flower in my hair
That's what I was wearing when we lay among the ferns
Earth between my toes and a flower I will wear
When he returns
Wind upon his face and my fingers in his hair
That's what he was wearing when we lay beneath the sky
Wind upon his face and my love he will wear
When swallows fly
Tears of sorrow running deep
Running silent in my sleep
Running silent in my sleep
What's the matter?
I know you're sad about Louie.
But he got careless! And you see what happens when you get careless?
OK, now, you guys go on back to your work.
Hey, how are you today, huh?
Ow! You bit my hand.
Don't you ever bite my hand again.
You can take a tip from Smokey
That there's nothing like a tree
Oh, they're great for kids to climb in
And they're beautiful to see
Huey... and Dewey.
I want you two guys to report right away to the recreation room.
Well, I see you're already here.
I bet you wonder why I gathered you here, haven't you, huh?
Well, I wanna beg your indulgence.
I got some new programs here for you.
Now.
Huey, come over and sit down here.
Dewey, you come right up here and sit down.
You can come a little closer if you want to, Dewey. Good boy.
That's for you, that's for you...
..and that's for me.
OK, boys.
Now.
I'm about to take you two guys for every dime you got.
Two, three.
Five, five, five.
Now, boys, let's play cards.
OK.
Now, Dewey.
OK.
How many cards you want, Dewey?
What are you doin'?
You threw down three kings.
You're nuts, you know that?
Well, your hand is obviously dead,...
..and let's see what you got here.
Well, he's got trash, so obviously
I'm the winner with three sevens.
Thank you, boys. I'm sorry.
You gotta get up in the morning to beat old Freeman. Early in the morning.
It's all mine. This time we'll play another hand and I don't want any mistakes.
We're not playing for 3-in-1 oil here.
We're playing for money.
OK. Now, Dewey, you took two.
No, I wasn't looking.
Hey, what have I said about talking between you guys? That's not fair.
I'm all by myself and you're talkin' between yourselves.
That's a house rule. No more talking.
Now, how many cards d'you want?
You don't want any cards? You just saw what the man did last hand.
All right. Dealer's taking two.
All right, Huey.
What have you got?
The man had a full house and he knew it!
Now, how about that?
The man had a full house and he knew it.
Huey and Dewey beat me at my own card game!
I know. I've actually been eating that crap.
Now let's go to the forest and get some real food.
What has happened to the forest?
Huey, go get me the grey book.
I don't know.
I just cannot figure out what's wrong.
OK, now, listen to me. I want you to make a slow, complete, 360º turn for me.
OK.
Now, hold it. Stop right there.
That's good. Now take a sample there.
Oh, no.
We're coming to the dome.
Wait right there, Huey.
Huey, I thought I told you to stay in the forest?
You're braced. You can't fall back.
It's OK, Huey. I got it, I got it.
That'll make you rest a little easier now.
Your little light.
No, no, I know where it is.
No, it's OK, Huey.
Just hold steady now.
You won't get that again.
There.
Now, that should be better.
Dewey, go get me that L-arm circuit wrench.
I understand.
I think I can manage here without it.
There.
I'm screwin' you in tight.
I'm sorry, Huey,...
..but that's the best that I can do.
I tried, but that... that's all
I can do for him, Dewey.
I don't know, Huey. It's just not working.
The forest is dying.
I have tried...
..everything.
And I just don't know what the hell it is.
Come in, Valley Forge. This is
Berkshire to Valley Forge. Do you read me?
Valley Forge. Come in, Valley Forge.
This is Berkshire. Can you read?
Valley Forge. Come in, Valley Forge.
This is Berkshire. Can you read?
We got a plot on you, Lowell. Fantastic!
We 're looking forward to seeing you, buddy. You made it!
Transmit, will ya?
Please acknowledge immediately.
Come in, Valley Forge. Can you read?
Please transmit immediately.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.
How about a word, Lowell, huh?
Hi.
Lowell?
I'm mighty glad to see ya, boy.
- Who is this?
- This is Anderson, Lowell.
My God, we've looked high and low for you.
How did you find me?
Why did you even try?
Hey, you must be kidding. We couldn't let you go without at least trying to find you.
We said we'd send out a search party.
I guess I forgot.
It wasn't easy finding you either, even with our deep-space tracking.
- I don't suppose it was.
- Freeman,...
..you'll have to find some way to jettison the dome.
And it's awfully dark out here, so it'll be safer ifyou don't blow it up.
The sun.
The sun! That's what it is.
- Did you hear what he said? It's the sun!
- What?
Uh, nothing. I was just saying that everything is all right.
Where was your big explosion?
We can't see it.
The explosion's on the other side of the ship.
Other side? OK. We 'll be docking on your port side in about six hours.
Right, six hours.
Huey, Dewey, come on.
We can still save the forest.
It's gonna work.
Dewey,...
I've taught you everything that I know about taking care of the forest here.
And, uh,...
..that's all that you have to do from now on,...
..is just maintain the forest.
Now, these lights here'll do the job that the sun would do.
They'll help revive everything.
I...
I just can't do it any more.
You see, things...
..things just haven't worked out for me.
Take care of yourself, Dewey.
Huey, you have to come with me...
..because you're just not working well enough to help Dewey.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.
We 'll be docking on your port side in two hours. Stand by for updates.
Take good care of the forest, Dewey.
You know, when I was a kid,...
..I put a note into a bottle...
..and it had my name and address on it.
And then I threw the bottle into the ocean.
And I never knew if anybody ever found it.
Heels of children running wild
In the sun
Like a forest is your child
Growing wild
In the sun
Doomed in his innocence
In the sun
Gather your children to your side
In the sun
Tell them all they love will die
Tell them why
In the sun
Tell them it's not too late
Cultivate, one by one
Tell them to harvest
And rejoice

Hi, Eli.
Eli.
Morning, George.
This is a white man's saloon, and it sells white man's liquor, and I'm telling you to crawl your filth out of here, breed... before I kill you.
Ha ha ha ha.
Do you hear, you red-skinned nigger?
A white man's talking to you.
You need stepping on, breed.
Back off, lawman.
You hear that, George?
I'm gonna bleed you, boy.
Jesus!
I'll get Quincey Whitmore.
Some Indian, I think.
Eli's been shot dead, Captain.
Some injun. He's run.
An injun, you say?
Eli's been shot!
Apache.
I'll get Will Coop.
He wouldn't want to miss this.
The sheriff's dead.
Gonna get that injun, Quincey?
Who is it?
Nye?
What is it, Quincey?
What do you want?
Saunders, just been killed.
It won't stop the world a-turning.
Ah!
Now then, ain't you a picture?
An injun shot him.
Oh, and you got dressed up for the hanging, huh?
Well, we'll have to catch him first.
Get your pants.
Yeah.
Getting night, Quincey.
All we have is sand in the mouth, and the horses are tired sore.
How's Harvey's horse?
Uh, threw a shoe and a hoof's split.
Ain't nothing for us, Quincey.
We got to turn back or bed down out here.
Well... we could go to the Hooker brothers' place.
Only about 10, 12 miles from here.
We can night there.
Aah!
Aw, come on, honey.
It ain't gonna hurt none.
Just give me a little honey.
All right.
Now, I'll tan your hide, do you hear me?
Hey, Jubal, hey, Jubal, by all that's holy!
I'll take the skin off you, you don't bide what I say.
Ah! You're damn crazy!
She's kin.
Come on, get back to the house.
Ah!
What's with that fool dog?
Riders coming, Jubal.
Earl!
Looks like Captain Quincey.
You've been up to something else?
There's nothing touching me, Jubal.
Quincey, you're riding late.
Posse, Jubal.
We're hoping to put down here for the night.
Why, sure. Why not.
What's the trouble?
Apache breed shot Eli Saunders dead.
Jesus hell!
Saunders, dead.
Elias, get some food on that stove.
Earl, help with them horses.
You lose him, Quincey?
Yeah.
Aw, that's hell's doing.
You figure on pushing it on at first light?
Well, he headed south.
I don't hold out much hope.
Jesus, what is that?
Potato whiskey.
Ha ha ha.
I'd rather be belly-shot.
You get the first swallow down, the rest tastes good.
Earl's right, Harve.
It takes getting used to, like dying.
Ha ha ha.
After your first cup, Harve, you're blind anyway, and after your second, you're darn glad you're blind.
Well, if we catch this breed, we won't have to hang him.
We'll just give him a jug of this.
Hey, you're a cruel one, Harve.
Where's Jubal?
He'll be out back setting some traps.
You best take your spencer,
Captain Quincey.
The Everettes had some stock run off by some Mimbrenos.
You never know.
Shh.
It's me, Jubal.
I mean to be no trouble, Jubal.
Your company's welcome.
Been thinking on tomorrow.
Be obliged to hear.
Circle around by the Everettes', pick them up.
Then go on to the Malechie place.
He's got two Mex riders.
Then over to Ezra Meade's.
He has an old Tigua
Indian that can track.
We might cut his trail before he gets too far over the line.
Well...
Might be no more than catching the wind.
We'll get him.
Quincey, me and my brothers will go past the edge of hell, but we'll have that breed and we'll burn him!
We'll burn him!
Me and Eli, we walked the whole war together.
That puts a man close to you.
We'll surely have that breed and burn him.
How long you figure it'll take, Quincey?
Well,
3 or 4 days at the most.
Me and my boys are alone here now.
Mimbrenos run off three of my best beef last week.
I can't be gone long.
I heard.
I'd understand, Josh, if you wanted not to join...
No, no, no. I'm gonna ride with you. Gibbon?
Naw, I'll ride anyplace to see a dead injun.
This could be a good land without the injuns.
Comanches in Texas first, now the Apaches here... killing, robbing.
Naw, I'm gonna ride with you, but I just can't be gone long.
Gibbon, you stay close.
You mind your ma.
Giddyap. Giddyap.
Hyah.
Hah! Yah!
Gavin!
Good morning, Mrs. Malechie.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Everette, gentlemen.
I believe you know, uh,
Quincey Whitmore and the Hooker brothers and, uh, Nye Buell.
How do?
Nye.
Martin Hall and Harvey Lansing.
Morning, ma'am.
Hell, I've known him since he came here.
Morning, Gavin.
George Dunn from up wolf butte way.
Will Coop.
Set you down, gentlemen.
Come on inside with you now.
We're not here to be sociable, Malechie.
Some breed killed Eli Saunders.
We're huntin' him.
Thought you might like to ride with us.
Yes, I heard about it yesterday.
One of my vaqueros, he knew this half-breed called Pardon Chato.
He bought some horses off him a year back.
Does the Mexican know if the breed has a piece of ground to run to?
I'll ask.
He's with my brother-in-law Brady bringing in some strays.
I'll send for them.
You be coming with us, Mr. Malechie?
Soon as I wash up.
Will you have coffee and biscuits?
That's to my taste.
We'll ride to Ezra Meade's.
Get him and his Indian and meet up at the wells.
Aw, Jubal, I had a hankering for biscuits and coffee.
You'll do as I say.
Just keep moving.
You see that Brady Logan woman?
That's what I call a fine-looking woman.
Put it from your mind.
Thinking ain't sinning.
Jubal, don't you ever get bothered?
I swear, brother Earl, one of these days you're gonna get caught halfway up somebody else's peach tree, and you're gonna be dead.
Brady Logan and the Mexican.
I'm taking Raoul.
Do you have to go, Gavin?
You know I have to.
I hate it when you're gone.
You and Moira won't be alone.
I'm leaving the Mexicans.
That's not the same.
And what would they think of us, neighbors and all?
We're new here, Edna.
We're carving out a place here.
We've gotta do what's expected of us.
To hunt down some poor man?
He killed the sheriff.
And he's Indian.
Is your pa around, Jacob?
I'm around.
You're not going to ask to step down, Jubal?
We haven't given you any call to speak harsh words, Ezra.
Say your piece.
Eli Saunders was murdered by a 'pache breed.
The world won't grieve.
Quincey Whitmore has got up a posse.
We thought you might want to ride with us, Ezra, or leastways, lend us your injun to track.
I won't ride with your kind.
As for the injun, he's his own man.
He says the Apache's not his enemy.
Now, ain't that pretty?
We ain't gonna let no damn injun...
Shut your mouth.
He was a white man, Ezra.
He was a redneck with a loud mouth and a gun.
I heard he got no more than he called for.
Son, you wanna swallow back them words?
Ride out.
We're waiting for an apology, Ezra.
You'll not get one here.
Don't give me the pleasure.
Hyah!
Where's Meade?
He won't ride with us.
He favors the breed.
Ezra always was a mite stand-off.
It'll not be forgotten.
I always thought of Meade as a good neighbor.
Who's the Mex?
He rides for Malechie.
Looks more than half Apache to me.
He's part Yaqui.
You best keep a short rope on him.
We'll turn south from here and head towards the high country.
Keep spread out and hunt for sign.
Anyone see anything, raise a shout or shoot twice.
Malechie, tell your Mexican to scout ahead over by that long ridge.
That's the last place we caught his trail.
Si, senor.
Whiskey and a hot sun don't mix.
Well, neither does my ass and this damn saddle.
Anyhow,
I used to heard it said you boys that rode with hood drank five states dry.
Always tell where hood's Texans have been by the empty bottles and the dead Yankees.
And it was true.
From Cemetery Hill till old slow trot Thomas broke us at Nashville, we had more than our share of both.
You know, one thing I never could fathom, Quincey.
How did them Yankees win?
They had more... more men, more guns, more food, more luck.
You know, when I look back at it,
I know now that it was all there for the seeing, except we didn't see it.
Getting licked, I mean, as Early as '63.
Hood took us up little round top at Gettysburg.
And if we could have held it, we could have rolled back those Yankees like old carpets.
But there were too many of them.
They say from Culp's Hill, you could see it all clear.
Gray lines comin' like the sea wash, yellin' and sort of breaking up when they hit the blue ridge and then... fallin' back.
Lee cried.
I guess he knew.
Hell... it was a good war.
Hyah, hyah. Hey.
Apache.
You sure?
Cierto.
How long ago? When?
An hour, maybe less, he says.
It don't make sense.
How can you tell that?
From the droppings.
Sun dries them pretty damn quick.
Still fresh inside, means it ain't been long.
Looks like he stayed here quite a spell.
Don't make sense, Jubal.
Should have been long gone from here, a running man and all.
Might be he figured we stopped chasing him.
Circled around for some reason.
Might be.
If he does, we'll have us a hangin' come nightfall.
Still damn hot, even with those clouds.
Well, maybe it'll sweat some of the whiskey out of your hide, Nye.
Watch it. Watch it!
Who's down?
Watch the horses.
Will, you okay?
You all right, Quincey?
He's hurt.
How is it, Will?
Is it broken?
Don't know. How's it feel, Will?
Sore inside.
I don't think it's broke, but he can't ride.
George, can you get him back to Arillo?
Sure, Captain.
We'll make a travois for him.
There's some brush down at the bottom there.
My place is closer.
You can get a wagon there.
We got our work cut out.
You're the lucky one, Will.
Gonna be all right, Will?
Sorry, George.
It's all right, Will.
I got a feeling we're well out of it anyway.
The Mexican... pretty good... pretty good.
Damn this light.
Might as well bed down here for the night, get a fresh start in the morning.
Unsaddle and make camp.
Hell, there's no water here, Quincey.
We're gettin' low on water.
And the horses will need some.
Earl's gone huntin' for water.
You can bet the honeybee's sugar tit there ain't no water to find.
Look around... sharp rock, dry dirt, and that's all.
Each man ration his own water.
Damp down your neck cloths or some piece of something and wet down the horses' muzzles.
I've eaten so much of this damn land today,
I can't even spit.
You'll eat more of it tomorrow.
We haven't even seen the shirttail of him yet.
We don't even know if what we're chasin' is the breed that done it.
Jubal thought he'd have a hangin' by night.
The only hangin' is my ass.
Quincey!
What is it?
What's going on?
Let me see that.
There's no use staring at them.
That rotten bastard!
You figure it was the breed?
Who'd you figure it was?
He could have cut our throats.
Maybe he isn't a killing man.
He's half Apache, ain't he?
You mix dog and wolf, you wind up with a killin' animal.
He killed Eli.
That's a fact.
He's either a damn fool or he got some game.
Apache don't leave tracks unless they got a reason.
I don't like it.
I don't like it one bit.
You want to hightail it for home,
Harvey, do you?
I didn't say that.
We're gonna find that breed... and we're gonna hang him.
And nobody's gonna do different.
Now, hold on now, Jubal.
There's no cause for that.
Each man is here by his own doin'.
If a man wants out, he can.
I wouldn't ride with a man who didn't want to ride with me.
We're gonna ride till we get him.
What are you all thorn and thistle about, Jubal?
Harve didn't say nothin' about going back.
Here comes the Mexican.
Where in hell's he been?
Tracking.
One thing for sure, that breed ain't far ahead.
Says he found fresh tracks heading south towards the lava hills.
That's, uh... bad country, Quincey.
This ain't hardly the Garden of Eden.
Listen, Quincey, you know, could be that breed is leadin' and we're followin'.
And if it's true, he could be leadin' us into bad Apache trouble.
Them Mimbrenos that run off my beef a while back, they could be hiding up in the hills.
Mind ya, I'm just sayin' maybe.
Maybe.
Well, what do you think?
Well, I learned one thing when I was with...
Tom Jeffords chasing Cochise.
You can never know what's in an Apache's mind.
Ain't a man like... like we know a man.
He thinks Apache, and that's a... a shut book full of... terrible things.
I got a real dislike of red beans.
Gonna be a hot one.
No, maybe snow by noon, Elias.
Ha ha. And the devil take a chill, huh?
You sure as hell all speed.
Breakfast done.
You Indian dirt.
Now, you keep all your killin' feelings for what we gotta do.
I tell you, brother Earl, you got some kind of sweet disposition, all sun and little white flowers.
Pleasant company, them Hooker boys.
Nothin' movin'.
That don't mean a damn thing.
Watch that broken ground over there.
I'm going to have a look.
Nobody about for quite a spell, I'd say.
Hyah!
Mescalero.
Si, senor.
Ain't nothin' here.
Hey, look. They had themselves a feast.
What is it?
Dog.
Apaches think on dog like you think on a good steak, Brady.
He'd rather eat dog than beef.
If he was hungry, he'd eat his own dung.
Well, no more than any other man, and less than most.
They aren't men.
They're animals.
Yeah, God knows what God was thinking when he made the Apache.
We'll burn them wickiups and then we'll ride.
Hyah!
Come on, let's get this one!
Ha ha ha!
Hey, Quincey.
We can't ride across these flats.
We'll tear the hearts out of the horses.
Malechie's right, Jubal.
The breed will ride across.
If he does, he'll be on foot before night.
How many miles across do you figure, Buell?
Enough.
When we get this damn Indian,
I'm sure gonna make his dyin' slow.
Put God's word on that.
Him and his damn land.
Hey, maybe he's got a woman out there... someplace.
Jeez, Earl, don't you ever think about nothin' else?
Don't let the horses break.
Whoa. Whoa.
Come here, you son of a bitch.
Whoa. Whoa.
Easy, easy.
I don't see a thing.
You're welcome to take a closer look.
Martin, you all in one piece?
Yeah.
Mexican all right?
Yeah, I seen him move.
There's only one way, Jubal.
Let's get at it.
Nye, Elias, Jubal, and me are going in after him.
The rest of you, spread out and give us cover.
Martin, you stay with the horses.
Aah!
We've been suckered, Quincey.
That's a god-given fact.
He said it's the breed they call Chato, all right.
He can tell by the horse he rides.
Well, I didn't think it was the president of the United States.
We gotta find those horses before night.
Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa.
You fly-tailed bastard!
Whoa, red.
Whoa.
I swear, I'm gonna stretch your hide and leave the rest for the crows.
Two more, hot and ready.
I'll bet that horse tastes better than he rode.
Nye, you got your own mother in a skillet before she got cold.
He never met the lady.
Where you from, Brady?
Before you came out to the territory.
A place called Greenock on the west coast of Scotland.
I used to work in Lithgow's yards, shipwright.
You ever long for it?
Yeah.
Yeah, water and fire different, this land and there.
There, the river, the sea fog, gray stone houses wet in the rain.
We used to stand behind the town and look down over the slate roofs across the river to the highlands on the other side.
Yeah.
I never did get to look at the sea.
Brother Jubal did once.
Said it was so big the mind couldn't hold it.
Two more, hot and rare!
You from Georgia, too, Quincey?
Texas.
Better drag them horses off.
They'll call all the flies in by morning.
Earl?
How are we with water?
Gettin' short.
And we're three horses gone.
You're... you're going on after him, Quincey?
Well... when the breed hit us, he had a mind to turn us back.
An injun will chase something until the chasin' costs too much and then he'll drop it.
That's how he thinks.
Now, he don't plan on something comin' after him no matter what.
He might just get careless now.
I'm agreed.
I say no more than a week for it.
You can't put a halter on it.
I can for myself.
And what about the others,
Harve and Josh?
They get their say?
Anybody want to back down, they go on foot, leave their water for them that stay with it.
Jubal, you got more generosity than June.
That's a Georgia choice.
I must say, it'll cut short thinking on.
Ha ha ha.
Nye, what in the hell are we doin' out here?
We've got Indian fever.
Sweats in a man, drives him blind in the eye and not quite right in the head.
We ain't seen scratch nor hair of that breed since he buffaloed us.
I ain't sure I want to.
I got a bad feelin' comin' over me, Nye.
I'll bet the Mex got water.
Got water, Mex?
You're holdin' out on us.
Earl.
I don't trust him.
He got too much Indian in him.
He ain't tryin' to find the breed.
He's breed himself.
He's tryin' to lose us, I'm tellin' ya.
You stand by your man, Malechie?
He's a good man.
Yaqui-Mex is more than halfway Apache.
Yeah, why should he help us?
You got Malechie's word.
You got a sickness on you, Earl.
Can't bide anything injun.
Do you trust him, Captain?
Well, we used Apache scouts when we went after Cochise.
They never broke faith.
Apache don't give his word easy, but given, I've never known one to break it.
I guess it's same with the Yaquis.
I'm going to kill you, Mex.
Understand?
And that's a promise.
You mean face on... or when he gives you his back?
You're gonna put foot on my patch once too often, Malechie.
You don't frighten me, sonny.
Earl, put the gun down.
You hear me?
Put it down.
He got his heels into me, I swear.
Put the gun away now.
Right now.
Ooh.
Ugh.
All right.
You made your point.
Take it easy.
Hey, you sure are one hell of a fighter, brother.
Big party, went by today or day before.
Si.
Most likely a raidin' party.
Or a murdering party.
We left our women, our places.
They could be heading that way.
Some of these horses are shod and unrode.
It means they've... they've raided and are on their way home.
Headin' north?
Well, could be Comanche.
Comanches?
Comanches ain't this far south.
Kiowa raid into Mexico.
They've been as far south as Yucatan.
Could be Apaches just as easy, Quincey.
An injun don't raid with so many extra mounts.
They've been and got what they want.
I agree with Jubal.
Comanche.
Maybe a few Kiowa.
Well, that don't ease the mind none.
We might run into them.
That could be real bad.
If they caught us in this open ground...
Me and the Mex will scout ahead, Quincey.
I do believe you... you really enjoying this, Quincey.
Now, the Hookers, they hate better than most.
That pushes them.
The others?
Ha ha ha.
They had small choice.
But you, Quincey... with you, it ain't so easy to read.
You got a... hungering.
For a thirsty man in a dry land, you got a lot of talk, Nye.
You know, some men just can't let go of time.
Passes them by, reach out and grab her shirttails.
Ha ha. That's you, Quincey.
You can't be just another face around a small town. Mm-mm.
That's what you're doing, all wrapped in gray, sitting proud on that horse, chasin' one damn half-breed and thinkin' about that bastard grant and his Yankees.
Enjoy it, boys.
It's the end of the water.
We'll find water in the morning.
Why don't we just come out with it?
The breed's lost us.
W-w-we ain't seen none of his sign.
What is it you're saying, Josh?
I'm saying that we're chasing a bad guess, only.
We run out of water.
And we got nothin' left to eat except some red beans and some scrawny prairie chickens.
And you've got an itch to get back to where there's good food and a fat wife.
I got a spread back there that needs working.
All we got out here is a handful of nothin'.
Dirt and dry mouths.
Josh is right.
Like hell he is.
You've got the quittin' streak, too?
Don't lean too heavy on me, Jubal.
I don't bend easy.
How do you see it, Quincey?
As Josh says, we might be guessing, but I got a feeling we're not.
That breed tried to lead us off and then lose us.
He didn't head for Mexico, and he could've and made it, easy.
Instead he... he headed into bad country and then swung north.
Now, put that with the fact that he bought supplies in town, and I think that points to him having someplace he wants kept safe.
Uhh.
Heh heh.
What's the matter, Josh?
Just a coyote.
Josh sees that as bad medicine.
Ha ha ha!
You gettin' Indian on us, Josh?
Heh heh heh.
Come on. Ease up, Josh.
I'm gonna kill that dog.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha!
You wouldn't think a grown man would worry about a dog.
Oh!
What's troubling you, Josh?
Oh, Quincey, I don't know.
I don't know.
It's just that things aren't working out the way I figured they would.
Say, don't you ever have second thoughts?
You know, are you still as sure about what we're doin' as when we started?
I tell you, Quincey,
I ain't a believin' man, but I got a god-fear.
I think he's gonna lay his hand on us.
And that's the truth.
Whoooo!
Yuhoo! Whoo! Yip! Yip!
Whohoo-wee!
Hey-yah!
Give me my hat.
Get all the water out of my hat.
Come on, get it.
Don't fill your bellies too fast.
Ha! Stop that.
You see any sign?
Well, that raiding party turned to the northeast a couple miles back.
Nothing since.
Ha ha ha!
Then they must be Comanches.
I hope we don't step on their tails.
Better 10 Comanche than one 'pache.
That's just like saying,
"better pox than the plague."
I seen Comanches in Texas, and, boy, I never wanna see one again, I can tell you.
Well, you don't see Apache.
You don't hear 'em and you don't see 'em.
It's like an act of God.
Oh, you are a comfort,
Captain Quincey.
Hey! Hey!
Cut that out!
Ah!
Brother Earl!
Here's candy for ya. Ha ha!
Oh, yeah.
Hey, look what I found!
Oh, boy!
Look at that. Look at that.
Let's see what you got, squaw.
Whoa, my!
Who's first to the honey pot?
Break get all couple of home here.
Ha ha ha!
You gonna stop that, or am I?
Don't get between a dog and his bone.
You too frightened, man?
This ain't the army, Malechie.
These men have no cause to listen to me.
Aah!
You stay clear of her.
Take her inside.
Come on. Get her up.
We got to organize this thing.
Come on. Hold it there.
What's the matter with you all?
Can you not see it?
There's no right in what we're doing.
It's against God.
She's a squaw.
Don't waste any sweat over it.
Malechie, did you ever see what injuns do when they get a white woman?
Aah!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
All right!
Tie her down. Tie her good.
This ain't right, Jubal.
Ever hunt wolf?
Get the mate, stake it out.
The other one always comes.
He'll come for her.
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Well, now, well, ain't that a courtesy?
Staking out a claim, Quincey?
Ha ha ha!
Well, it's gonna be dark soon.
Take up your positions.
Well, come on. Go ahead!
He'll be here, sooner or later, for sure.
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Do you think he'll come?
I hope not.
I want it done and be home.
We'll not be clean of it even then.
We shouldn't be here, Gavin.
Get them horses out of there!
Everybody, shoot the scoundrel down!
Look! He's up on the roof!
Let's get the horses.
Where the hell is he?
Up there! Up there!
Yah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Get 'em out!
Hyah! Hyah!
Seen that?
Thought I saw somethin' move.
Aah!
I... I... I think I got him.
Yeah.
Hall, check the woman.
Put out those fires!
Woman is cut loose and gone!
He's got the woman!
Yeah, you like startin' fires, don't you, you old bastard?
Earl, bring a rope!
What's troubling him?
He says they're beasts and fools.
The Apache will kill now.
No, no, no. He'll run...
Now that he's got the woman.
You figure he'll come back?
He got what he come for.
Would you have dared it, comin' in to get her?
No.
I would've.
Why?
For a squaw?
She was a good lookin' woman.
Earl, there never was a woman born worth dyin' for.
You don't feel for nothin', do you, Elias?
Know somethin'?
Come sunup,
I'm goin' out after her.
You got the fever.
I want that woman for my own.
Well, now, Earl, brother Jubal might get a little bit upset, you marrying a squaw.
Jubal!
Jubal don't own me.
What did I ever get from him?
Whippin' and hard words.
What are we, Elias?
Hatin' and killin' and whorin'.
Runnin' scratch cattle.
Ain't got nothin' soft.
Ain't got nothin' don't go bitter in the mouth.
I want somethin'.
Well, Earl, you better wipe them drippings from your mind.
You don't see, do you?
Like you got a box around your head.
The woman, she'll slow him down, Quincey.
It's a carving of a little bear.
Found it inside with some others.
Means there's a child.
That don't change anything.
Yeah, it does.
If we catch up to him, we hang him, but... the woman and the child, if they're with him, they go unharmed.
I want your word on that, Jubal, or you and your brothers can go it alone.
Well, you're gonna have a tough time convincin' Earl that way.
He wants that woman.
Where is Earl?
He went after her soon as it got light.
Why didn't you stop him?
Well, he was in no mind to pay heed.
You didn't even try, did you?
He's full-growed, Jubal.
I oughta whup you.
But you won't, Jubal,
'cause you know I'd put a hole in your gut.
Best wait for breakfast, Jubal.
Grab all you can to eat.
We leave in 5 minutes.
What's the hurry?
Earl went after the woman.
Jesus hell.
I'm obliged, Quincey.
Whoa.
His horse bolted.
Hyah. Giddyup.
Take your hands of Cain from him.
I... I don't want to bury him here.
It's an empty place.
Empty.
Nothin' to remember.
We command into thy hands of mercy, most merciful father, the soul of our brother departed.
We commit his body to the earth beseeching thy infinite goodness to give us grace to live in thy fear and love and to die in thy favor.
No promises now, Quincey.
May God pity the man that comes between me and that... and that breed.
Even an Apache woman's got to slow down soon.
I doubt if the woman's with him now.
Sure leavin' a good trail.
He ain't runnin'.
Well, you think he'd make a fight of it?
When he chooses.
Quincey, you know, I think he's doubled back on himself.
I think he's leadin' us in a circle.
I noticed.
Well, what's he doin'?
He's pickin' his ground, I'd say.
What's that supposed to mean?
To you this is so much bad land.
Rock, scrub desert, and then more rock.
A hard land that the sun has sucked all the good out of.
You can't farm it, you can't carve it out and call it your own, so you damn it to hell, and it all looks the same.
That's our way.
To the breed, now, it's his land.
He don't expect it to give him much, and he don't force it none.
And to him, it's almost human, a livin', active thing.
And it'll give him a good place to make his fight against us.
You know, sometimes you spook me, Quincey.
Where?
Just one horse goin' that way.
Maybe he cut the other one loose.
Maybe, maybe not.
He's cut back and got behind us.
We'd best backtrack and see if we can find out where he turned off.
What if he went straight on?
We lose a little time.
Better that than a scalp or two.
You're guessin', Captain.
We're both guessin'.
All right, Quincey, what do we do?
Spread out and find where he turned off.
Keep a sharp eye.
The breed ain't gonna give us much ground for mistakes.
What's the matter?
Look about you, Jubal.
Wouldn't you say that this is... about as good a place as you can find to do your killin'?
If he was up there in those rocks, we'd be easy to cut off.
Well, we'll just have to climb a bit, that's all.
And climb right into him?
He can't be on both sides.
Well, behind us or in front of us, once we start scramblin' up there, we've lost our mobility.
We'd be like lame men.
It's too steep, and we got horses.
We can't pull our horses up through there, not and move fast.
Do you think he's up there, Quincey?
Well, he might be.
Aw, he's got you so you're scared to move, Captain.
He's only a lousy Indian.
He's half Apache.
We're ten men!
This morning, we were eleven.
You seem awful sure he'll make a stand of it.
We raped his woman and killed his kin.
Do we wait for dark?
That wouldn't give us much.
We'd have to ride fast over blind ground.
We pull back.
Try to find a way around it.
We'd lose too much time.
You're blind, Jubal.
You can't see for hate.
Try to go around?
That might take 5 or 10 miles.
We'd lose what's left of today and half of tomorrow tryin' to pick up his trail again.
Why, I'd kill the man who'd let that breed get away!
I told you that this morning, and I mean it!
Mount.
Keep low and... and ride like hell.
Ho!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Quincey! Josh!
It's Hall.
Somebody's got to go back for him.
No. He's probably dead, Gavin.
How do you know?
Maybe he's just wounded.
You better hope he's dead.
This falls on you, Jubal.
You'd do well, Quincey, to close your mouth.
We know where the breed is.
We can box him in on that ridge.
There's hundred ways out of there.
Logan, Malechie, stay with the horses.
We'll go in.
Right, matey. Come on.
Ah!
Over here!
Quick!
Sweet mother of whores.
It's a... it's a hell of a place to die in.
There ain't no good places.
I guess not.
The breed came.
He grabbed my hair, just stared at me.
I guess Josh was right about that coyote.
God, I don't want to die.
Let's get him out of here!
Come on, Hall.
Easy, Hall.
O Lord, we beseech thee, mercifully hear our prayers and spare all those who confess their sins unto thee.
And they whose consciences by sin are accused by thine merciful pardon may be absolved, through Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
Have mercy on me, o God, according to thy loving kindness.
According to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions.
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sins, for I acknowledge my transgressions.
My sin is ever before me.
Against thee, thee only have I sinned.
I've done this evil in thy sight.
Your words are no use, Scotsman.
Close your book.
My mind's on a... on a pretty little whore in Lordsburg.
Nye, Nye, once I knew a pretty little girl.
Once I had a pretty little girl
Pretty little whore in Lordsburg
Eyes like berries
and lips like cherries...
Come at us!
He's just lettin' you know he's out there.
Are you just gonna leave him?
Well...
We can't sit around here all day waitin' for him to die.
I've had my fill of you, Jubal.
Go, then. And God mark you for the man that you are.
Don't drop that hammer.
He's got us in the open.
Anybody see where them shots come from?
From the hills somewhere.
Quincey! Quincey!
Get on your horses and ride out of rifle range.
Quincey, my shoulder,
I think it's broke.
Can you make it to the horses?
I'll have to.
Hyah!
Ha! Ha!
Ha!
Get him down.
Easy.
He's up in them high rocks.
We can circle wide and get behind him.
Malechie, you stay with the horses.
Right.
Ugh.
Nothing?
Nothing.
The breed got him.
Yeah.
Can't be sure of that.
Yeah, I think we can.
It's as if the ground had opened and devoured him.
You can't fight what you can't see.
He'll hunt us down... one after one... till we're all gone.
It looks bad.
Josh needs doctoring.
Harve's right.
He won't make it without help.
We're goin' back tomorrow.
No.
Nobody is runnin' from this.
Stay if you want, Jubal.
The rest of us are... goin' back in the morning.
You saw Earl.
You all saw what was done.
If I don't get to a doctor, I'll die.
Looks that way.
You want blood for blood, don't you, Jubal?
We came here to hang a murderin' breed, and hang him we will.
What's the matter with you?
He's got us beat.
Can't you see that?
Brother... looks like Harvey's lost his taste for justice.
You came to hunt a man because he was half Apache.
You raped and killed to feed your hunger.
In the name of God, don't call it justice.
Ha ha! Listen to our bible tongue.
What sets you apart?
You rode with us.
You got the same dirt we got.
We got three... maybe four dead and one bad wounded.
We're goin' home in the morning.
Damn you to hell, Quincey Whitmore.
I've taken enough of your words.
Now I don't want to kill you, Quincey, but by God's own eyes, I will, right here and now, where you stand if you call me to it.
We stay.
Now I want to hear you say it clear and straight out,
"we stay till that
Apache breed is hung."
You think you can hold us with your gun?
Yes, I do.
Say it, Quincey.
Well, speak, man.
Do what he wants now, and he'll have us savages like himself.
We stay... till the Apache breed is hung.
Josh and me are leaving, Jubal.
Well, I never judged you to have bone enough, Harvey.
Well, that breed's got us beat, and Josh gotta have a doctor.
Elias, if you move from that blanket, you'll put the death on your brother.
You ready, Josh?
Jubal, I gotta get to a doctor.
I wouldn't run out on you otherwise.
Oh, I know that, Josh.
Every man's got an end to his rope.
I'll bear no hurt against you.
If a man feels he must pull a gun on another that he's ate with and rode with, well, then it's best that they part.
Quincey, I'm sorry.
We looked to you.
But last night you left us no choice but this way.
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
I can't stomach a man who runs out on his friends.
Drop them.
Leave it.
God, Quincey.
Do I go after him, Jubal?
You do.
Don't kill him unless you have to.
Now, you two, stack them guns right there.
Come on.
You got nothing to gain by trouble save a lonely dyin'.
Just remember that.
If the Apache comes, you grab for them guns.
If not, don't you get within 6 feet of them.
Now, look to Quincey.
Take care, hear?
Right, Jubal.
Mmm.
Don't fuss me.
Quincey...
Quincey, I...
Earl...
Earl was the youngest.
He was just 16 when the war started.
Well, there was nothin' before the war... nothin' after.
You understand me, Quincey?
I need to see that breed dead.
I can't step past that.
You knew.
I told ya.
I got no... hate against you, Jubal.
Ten years ago, I'd have...
I'd have killed you for what you did last night.
Ohh...
Ohh, God.
Ha... you should've seen us at Chickamauga.
Damn that George Thomas.
Damn him for... for all the men he put in the ground that day.
Hooker took the ridge.
And you could hear... the screamin' men... dyin'.
It's like... it's like a flower that grows in the night.
You know...
I always wanted a... dog... ha ha.
When I... I was a boy.
But I...
I...
How long's it been now?
More than four hours.
Nearer five.
What's holdin' you, Elias?
He'll not come now.
I'm thin on patience, Malechie, so bite hard and shut tight.
You know it's true.
You'll never see him again.
He's lying out there somewhere, like Josh... maybe not so lucky.
He'll come.
All right, cover him with rocks to keep them birds off.
Hurry... hurry with the fire, Gavin.
We shouldn't take the risk.
2130, day 547.
Unscheduled course correction due at 2200.
Pre-correction check:
Rotation axis plus three degrees.
Nitrous oxide pressure:
4,100, rising to 5,000.
Quad jets C and D on pre-select.
Rotor ignition sequence beginning in 3-0.
Thruster line reactors on standby.
Vincent, notify me with 15 to go.
- Alex?
- Yes, Dan.
Have you determined the difference in ETAs with and without our correction?
Working on it. You know, we shouldn't be needing a direction at this time.
Vincent, run a confirmation on the last inertial fix... and check it with another celestial, please.
I have.
It is correct... but I think I've found the reason for our present variation.
- Mr Pizer.
- Yes, Vincent.
Mr Pizer, I think you should come up here.
What's up, Vincent?
The largest black hole
I have ever encountered, Mr Pizer.
Hmm. Let's have a look at it on the holograph.
My God!
Right out of Dante's Inferno.
Yes. The most destructive force in the universe, Harry.
Nothing can escape it, not even light.
I had a professor who predicted that eventually black holes... would devour the entire universe.
Why not, when you can see giant suns sucked in and disappear without a trace?
- Give us the magnification, Vincent.
- Polarizing image.
Every time I see one of those things,
I expect to spot some guy in red with horns and a pitchfork.
It's a monster, all right.
A rip in the very fabric of space and time... but I picked up something else of interest.
- Let's see it.
- It hasn't moved since I first picked it up.
- It seems to be some kind of ship.
- Do you copy, Alex?
- Roger, Dan.
- Enlarge again, Vincent, and let's try to identify it.
But how could anybody be out here ahead of us?
Arcturius-10, United Kingdom.
Liberty-7, United States.
Russian experimental space station,
series five.
France, Sahara Module 5-3.
Pluto-4, Japan.
United States,
Space Probe One.
- That's it.
- USS Cygnus.
Dr Kate, wasn't that the ship
your father was on?
USS Cygnus.
Its mission: To discover habitable life in outer space. Same as ours.
Signal that ship, Vincent.
- Activate the sensors, Charlie.
- You bet.
They were recalled to Earth
20 years ago... their mission considered a failure.
How that must have galled
Dr Hans Reinhardt.
Did you ever meet
Commander Reinhardt?
Collided with him would be a more accurate description.
- A legend.
- So he believed.
Reinhardt had the knack of making his own ambitions... seem like a matter of national pride.
Why, he talked the space appropriations committee... into the costliest fiasco of all time... and refused to admit failure.
He ignored his recall.
Maybe not.
Maybe it never got through.
That ship just... just disappeared.
They've never been seen again.
Dan, get us in close enough. Vincent and I could get aboard on tethers.
To quote Cicero, "Rashness is the characteristic of youth... prudence that of mellowed age and discretion the better part of valour."
No sense leaving the story of a lifetime untold, Captain.
I believe there is, Harry... and it's looking straight at us.
Picking up anything on the sensors, Charlie?
Negative, but with all that turbulence...
out there, our signal
might not be getting through.
According to my instruments, it hasn't moved a centimetre... since we first spotted it.
But, Alex, how can a lifeless derelict defy that kind of gravity?
I don't know, but it's certainly worth investigating.
My instincts
are against it, Alex... but we'll go in for a closer look.
Fix a coordinate approach, Charlie.
Full power on the thrusters, Vincent.
Strap yourselves in. We'll be feeling the gravitational force... right now.
Range: 29551 and closing.
What's your reading on Cygnus, Vincent?
Triangulation shows it's still holding steady, sir.
- Gravity pull?
- .02450 and rising.
Puts us in an escape attitude of
8-5 degrees. Cut power by two-thirds.
- 8-5 degrees.
She's bucking like a bronco.
- Gravity?
.46960, still climbing.
Switching to manual.
Captain, I'm not sure how long the engines will remain operable... against that much force when we turn back.
Alex, gravity's close to maximum.
We can afford one pass, and then we're gonna have to get the hell out.
- Zero gravity.
- Cut the power.
Smooth as glass.
It's like being in the eye of a hurricane.
- What happened?
- Natural phenomenon.
Or something from that ship.
Activating the microbeam.
Picking up anything, Charlie?
Negative, Alex. No way our signals can't get through this time.
- Gravity's at maximum, Dan.
- My God, I think it's got us.
We're starting to tumble.
Hundred percent on the roll jet quads.
Roll jet quads, full capacity.
- Air break at midship. Losing oxygen.
- Charlie... give me a full burst at 180 degrees, main thrusters.
We got a break here too!
Emergency readouts show the primary and secondary air lines ruptured!
Never rains.
Full-pitch attitude thrusters,
A and B rings.
The black hole is pulling us in.
Going to manual.
The number four hatch blew outward,
Captain. I'll go out and secure it.
Watch yourself out there, Vincent.
There's more gravity pull than we've ever encountered.
Yes, sir.
Alex, we'd better check out the damage below!
Vincent, do you read me?
Come in, Vincent.
Kate, either we have a malfunction here... or there's too much interference on the outside.
See if you can get through to Vincent with your ESP.
I got through to Vincent.
He said there are old pilots and there are bold pilots... but there are very few old, bold pilots.
She's tuned in on Vincent, all right.
Grab my leg! My leg!
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
And that's got it!
Hit the boosters, Charlie. We gotta make a run for that zero gravity.
He secured the hatch!
Good.
We can only make temporary repairs
here, Dan, and that's only
to the secondary line.
Unless we can replace the damaged parts in the main regulator... we're gonna lose our oxygen supply.
Damn!
Dan, the tether's broken.
- I'm going after him.
- Stay at your post, Charlie.
What the hell are you made of?
- What if it were one of us out there?
- Vincent is one of us.
Reverse thrusters and look for a place to set down.
- What's going on?
- That's what I'd like to know.
Like a tree on Christmas morning.
Locking warheads into firing position.
Hold it, Dan. They've got to be friendly. They could have blasted us right out of the sky.
Your side, Dan.
You got a picture down there?
- There are people on board.
- Just a shadow, Kate.
Enlarge, please.
There are people, Alex.
I know it. I feel it.
Docking elevator coming up.
Wonder why they didn't roll out the red carpet earlier.
I don't know, and I don't like it.
But they're calling the shots, and we've got to repair this craft.
Dan, I'm sorry I blew my stack.
I guess we all have a soft spot for the little guy, Charlie.
- Yeah.
- All right, let's bring her in.
Okay.
Bingo.
We have gravity.
Nice work, Vincent.
Out of the frying pan; hopefully, not into the fire.
- Are you all right, Vincent?
- Nothing a hammer and a little metal polish can't fix. Thank you.
Looks like we'll have to go to them.
- Charlie, you'll stay with the Palomino.
- But you need everyone that's got...
- Charlie.
- Don't worry, Mr Pizer.
They also serve who only stand and wait.
Vincent, were you programmed to bug me?
No, sir, to educate you.
When I volunteered for this mission,
I never thought I'd end up playing straight man to a tin can.
This place looks as if it hasn't been used for years.
It's eerie. I feel like a thousand eyes are watching us.
Vincent!
- Charlie, do you read me?
- Vincent, are you all right?
Weapons destroyed by laser fire.
No injuries. Hold your position.
Vincent.
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Down, but never for the full count, Dr Kate.
- So much for the friendship theory.
- Come on, Harry. They could have killed us if they'd wanted to.
Yeah, sure.
I don't like it when somebody else pulls the strings, Captain.
Neither do I, Vincent.
Whoever's up in that control tower is calling the shots right now.
Whoever or whatever, Captain.
- Easy, Kate.
- I know I shouldn't get my hopes up, but it's hard not to.
I know.
I don't mind telling you,
I'm a little concerned.
Some of my brother robots were assigned to Project Black Hole... programmed to send ESP messages back from space probes.
Oh, a grand experiment, the scientists thought.
Also ancient history, Vincent.
Not to me, Mr Booth.
Not this close.
The heat in there melts types like me rather quickly.
Hello? I'm Kate McCrae.
Is Officer Frank McCrae aboard?
They appear to be some sort of robot, Dr Kate.
Look over here.
Incredible.
It oughta be.
Sure cost the taxpayers enough.
Kate.
There's someone else with us.
Identify yourself.
What is your type and model?
- A mystery monster.
- Don't move.
Charlie, do you read me?
Charlie Pizer. Come in, Charlie.
This is the story to end all stories, Harry.
A ship of robots and computers with this thing in charge?
Not quite, Dr Durant.
Maximilian and my robots only run this ship the way I wish it run.
How do you know my name?
You were monitored ever since our sensors first detected you.
Now, now, Maximilian.
Calm down.
Don't pick on small people.
Such a nice little robot.
He's harmless.
Miss McCrae, you might come closer.
Welcome aboard the Cygnus.
Hans Reinhardt.
It can't be.
You always did have a flair for theatrical entrances, Doctor.
Dr Reinhardt.
My father, where is he?
My dear child,
I'm sorry to dash your hopes... but your father's not with us any more.
He's dead.
A man to be proud of.
A grave personal loss to me.
He was a trusted and loyal friend.
And you are his daughter.
Yes. The same eyes.
The same eyes.
And the rest of the crew?
- They didn't make it back?
- They did not.
Pity, for such a good crew.
What happened when your mission was recalled, Doctor?
Is this going to be an interview, Mr Booth?
I haven't had that for a long time, but if you want to...
I will answer.
Now, don't be frightened.
Nobody's going to harm you.
The Cygnus encountered a field of meteorites... and was disabled... our main and auxiliary communication systems smashed.
We were adrift.
I told the crew to abandon ship... to return home as ordered.
Perhaps it was another of what you term my "theatrical gestures," Mr Booth... but I chose to remain aboard.
Your dear father chose to remain with me.
We never knew what happened to the others.
You've lived out here for 20 years? Alone?
Twenty years?
Twenty Earth years, but...
I didn't live exactly alone.
I've created companions of a sort.
They look a bit medieval... but I'm a romantic.
Ah, Mr Pizer!
Come in. Join us.
Thank you.
Have you met the goon squad?
"Goon squad." Nice.
I'm Hans Reinhardt.
Forgive this little incident, but you were disarmed for your own safety.
Dismissed.
My robots are programmed to react against any act of aggression.
I assure you, none was intended.
I am glad to hear that. Please.
Consider yourselves my guests.
We won't impose on your hospitality, Doctor.
Just long enough to repair our ship.
And then we can offer you the means of returning to Earth, Doctor.
What makes you think
I want to return?
The Cygnus is in danger of being destroyed here.
Yes! Your captain was worried about that too.
One step too far... and we are done.
But there's no cause for alarm.
We developed antigravity forces to maintain our position.
It's what you might call a Mexican stand-off.
If you were monitoring us, you must have picked up our signals.
- That's right.
- You failed to reply.
Did I have to reply?
Charlie, Charlie.
Slight communications problem.
Maximilian will take you to requisition whatever you need to repair your ship.
In the meantime, you and Dr McCrae will get enough information... to make your mission of historic importance.
- Back off, Vincent.
- Not until he does.
When you're nose to nose with a trash compactor, you cool it.
Now, what does that remind me of?
Oh, yes. David and Goliath.
A classic confrontation.
Only this time,
David is overmatched.
Call him off, Reinhardt.
I said call him off!
On my ship, you ask, Captain.
Indeed.
Please, call him off, Doctor.
Maximilian?
Remember, these are our guests.
Now, let him in.
Show that you've good manners.
That's a good robot.
Communication problems aside, he took an awful long time to show any lights.
- Be careful.
- I know.
Those other robots aren't any friendlier than Dr Frankenstein's monster.
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
Maybe you should've smiled when you said it, Vincent.
Doctor, this ship doesn't appear to be crippled.
Of course not. We repaired the damage and became operable again.
But you never obeyed the order to return to Earth.
That's right.
I refused this order.
There were larger considerations... other worlds yet to be explored... life dreams unrealized.
The authorities would still consider that an act of piracy, Doctor.
What would you have said, Mr Booth, if the authorities... would have called back Columbus just before he discovered the New World?
You wouldn't even exist.
I'm about to prove to you that the end justifies the means.
Pretty busy around here, Max.
What are you gearing up for?
Tell you what, Charlie.
You'll take care of business here, and I'll go back to the ship and start working on that regulator.
Don't bother to point the way, Max.
I'll find it by myself.
Well, we need primary and secondary demand oxygen pressure regulators... and an ECS proportion flow valve controller.
Max.
Dr Reinhardt told you to requisition the parts for us.
Let's get cracking.
Way to go, Max.
Way to go.
Vincent. Vital Information
Necessary Centralized.
Labour force. The 396.
I see by your markings you're from the old 2-8.
Programmed in Houston.
There is enough instant energy down there to supply all of Earth.
The first step to colonizing the galaxy.
You will be remembered as one of the greatest space scientists of all time.
I have never doubted that.
It's about time that people learn about their failures and my successes.
You should come back with us and enjoy the glory of that success.
I don't want to go back, and I don't enjoy successes any more.
There is too much at stake to pull back.
I'm on the brink of a great achievement.
All this is just the beginning.
- The beginning? Of what?
- You will know in due time.
Dr Reinhardt, could we have a demonstration...
- of this incredible new power source.
- Harry?
Come with me, and I'll show you everything.
I call it "Cygnium," after my ship.
Must've made a wrong turn, Max.
Quite a layout.
I said it's quite a layout you got here.
Can you speak?
Are you programmed to speak?
No, I guess not.
No, I guess that'd make you a little bit too real, wouldn't it?
That Reinhardt sure loves to play God, doesn't he?
Hey, wait a minute!
Hey!
- I know what I saw, Charlie.
- Dan, nobody buries a robot.
- I didn't say it was a robot.
- Then what?
I don't know what they shot out into space, but they did it with all the reverence and honour of a human funeral.
Huh. Maybe Reinhardt lied.
Maybe there are some survivors still alive. What do you think he's up to?
- Haven't got a clue.
- Well, whatever it is... he seems cooperative enough about getting us operable.
A wolf remains a wolf... even if it has not eaten your sheep.
Correct, Vincent. The sooner we blast out of here, the better.
Whatever you say.
Let's snap it up, Vincent.
A pint cannot hold a quart,
Mr Pizer.
If it holds the pint, it's doing the best it can.
Thank you, Vincent.
- Fascinating.
- From a distance.
Are you interested in black holes?
How can one not be overwhelmed by the deadliest force in the universe?
That long, dark tunnel to nowhere.
Or somewhere.
These are exactly answers yet to be explored.
You've defined the power of the black hole with your antigravity calculations.
A stunning achievement, sir.
- You think so?
- Yes. I do.
Thank you.
I think, Dr Durant... that you are a man who longs for a sense... of his own greatness... but has not yet found his true direction.
Right?
Perhaps I could find it here... if you're in no hurry for us to leave.
Shall we discuss that over dinner?
- It's only dinner.
- "Said the spider to the fly."
I should be with you.
Yeah, we'll be safer without you and Max trying to knock heads.
I can handle that thing.
Well, far be it from you to admit there isn't anything you can't handle.
There are three basic types,
Mr Pizer. The wills, the won'ts and the can'ts.
The wills accomplish everything, the won'ts oppose everything... and the can'ts won't try anything.
Well, do us all a favour, Vincent, and try to be a can't... especially where that monster's concerned.
We need you, not another corkscrew.
Hey, hey, hey. Look at that.
Vincent, you're gonna have the time of your life in there.
I don't mean to sound superior, but I hate the company of robots.
So try and relax.
Have some fun.
Remember what they say:
"All work and no play"?
"All sunshine makes a desert," so the Arabs say.
You'll alert me if you're in trouble, Captain?
Why don't you go on in there and have some laughs, Vincent.
We've been in some scrapes before, and we're gonna get out of this one.
As you were.
- Who's the flashy black hat?
- S-T-A-R.
Special Troops Arms Regiment.
Reinhardt's prototype for the sentry robots.
He was number one until Reinhardt built Maximilian.
He's sharp, but we're sharper.
Do you ever go up against him?
- Once.
- What happened?
I beat him. He got so upset, he blew a fuse.
He had his revenge, though.
He did things to me that I sure don't like to think about.
A great many experiments are in progress aboard the Cygnus, gentlemen... some of them dangerous.
I suggest in the interest of your own safety... that there are no more unescorted excursions for the duration of your stay.
- Agreed?
- Sure, sure.
Good. Please, sit down.
Captain.
Well, Mr Booth, what's new on Earth?
Well, I don't think it's changed very much since you left, Doctor.
Nothing much ever changes.
Same news, different names.
- You still writing for the same paper?
- The same.
Still on strike?
Ah, fresh mushroom soup.
Prepared from my own personal garden.
I remember writing about the extensive agricultural station.
Large enough to supply the needs of the entire crew, wasn't it, Doctor?
These days it's tiny.
Just enough for one person.
Ah. Naturally.
Our wine and our spare parts are vintage, Captain.
I hope they're satisfactory.
We've had to modify a few of the parts, Doctor... but, uh, that shouldn't take long.
- We'll be ready to leave soon.
- Speak for yourself, Dan.
I, for one, believe I have a great deal to learn from Dr Reinhardt.
Thank you.
Our mission's finished, Alex.
A toast.
To you and your companions,
Dr Durant... on the occasion of your visit to the Cygnus.
Welcome aboard, Miss Kate.
The only Earth people to know of my existence.
And to you, sir, and your magnificent accomplishments.
Tonight, my friends... we stand on the brink... of a feat unparalleled in space exploration.
If the data on my returning probe ship matches my computerized calculations...
I will travel where no man has dared to go.
Into the black hole?
In... through... and beyond.
Why, that's crazy.
Ha! Impossible!
The word "impossible,"
Mr Booth... is only found in a dictionary of fools.
Are there any more like us left on board?
I'm the last one. These upstarts think I'm some old freak.
They still haven't improved on our model. Oh, you can't modify perfection. We are the best.
Oh, lordy.
He wants a rematch.
As an old navy hero once said,
"Damn the torpedoes. Full speed ahead!"
He also said something about goin' in harm's way.
Nice shooting, Bob.
You'd have beat him again if he hadn't bumped you.
Nah, I'd have missed on purpose.
Don't worry. I'll uphold the honour of the old outfit.
STAR, Vincent's my name.
Sharpshooting is my game.
Try me.
Your probe ship has only gone to the event horizon, Doctor... not into the black hole itself.
How do you expect the Cygnus to escape being crushed by the force in there?
I would assume that Dr Reinhardt has created an antigravitational force field... capable of withstanding that stress.
Indeed, and I know you will say,
Captain, that one mistake in navigation can be fatal.
But I know exactly what I'm doing.
The course I have chosen... will take the Cygnus through at its optimum angle of rotation.
The vortex will cause us to move at incredible speed... and that angle will slingshot us through.
Nice shot, STAR.
Simple, but nice.
Tricky. Here, try this.
If one dances, one must pay the piper.
If there's anything I cannot stand, it's a sore loser.
Meet me in parts storage.
So, as I understand it, you want the Palomino to monitor your journey.
That's right. I need you to go to another place and another time... a place where, if you're lucky...
I'll have the possibility to find what we call "the ultimate knowledge."
Yes, Maximilian?
The probe ship is about to dock.
Continue your meal, gentlemen.
Cuckoo as a Swiss clock.
My name's Bob,
Bio-sanitation Battalion.
I couldn't talk freely before, but I have a whole lot to tell you.
If Maximilian knew you were here, why, it'd be the end for the both of us.
Can you permanently rearm my lasers?
Yeah, I can. Vincent, you and your friends are in grave danger.
Reinhardt only turned the lights on to prevent any damage to the Cygnus.
This is a death ship.
What does your intuition tell you, Kate?
That Dr Reinhardt is walking a tightrope between genius and insanity.
- I think the guy's nuts.
- I don't buy that.
Well, whatever he is, he's an out-and-out liar.
That tiny little one-man garden of his is big enough to feed an army.
Nothing strange about that.
It purifies the air.
- Oh.
- Tell them about the funeral, Dan.
A robot funeral, Alex.
It was almost human.
Look. Granted, the 20 years out of contact with people... has made this man a little eccentric, but you can't ask me to believe... that he's programmed his robots to feel emotions.
- Come on.
- I know what I saw, Alex... and we only have Reinhardt's word for what happened to his crew.
All I know is that that robot gardener was almost human too.
Ha! He even walked with a limp.
What spooks you about a malfunctioning robot, Harry?
I wasn't spooked, old buddy.
I'm just telling you that I had a gut feeling that... that I was looking at some kind of... some kind of person.
- What are you getting at?
- That we make our apologies, say our goodbyes... and get off this ship as quick as we can.
Oh, now, wait a minute, Dan.
Now, hold it, hold it.
Now, now, now, l-let's stop and figure this thing out.
If Reinhardt has antigravity strong enough to hold him here...
I figure he's got enough to pull away.
- So?
- "So"?
So why not take this ship and Reinhardt back home?
That's a long shot you're talking about, Harry.
Aw, come on. You've got two scientific wizards here... to figure out the computers, a-and they can even reprogram the robots.
And the three of us can handle Reinhardt and that pet monster of his.
I'm tellin' you, we could all be heroes.
We could also be dead.
These poor creatures are what's left of the crew.
Kept alive by means
I don't pretend to understand.
Humans?
They're more robot than human.
Let's get outta here before we're discovered.
Too late. Watch it!
Think there are any more?
All clear.
Let's get rid of the evidence.
Maximilian will take you to Debriefing.
I will check out your computers personally.
How long before they'll start searching for these two?
It depends on their duty schedule.
Could be anytime.
Then we have to move fast.
So, he neglected his duty to his country for a higher ideal.
So what? What basis in fact do you have for these macabre speculations?
I agree that his style is somewhat unconventional... but he's willing and eager to share his knowledge with us.
- Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- We're not staying aboard this ship any longer than we have to, Alex.
- I think that's up to Reinhardt to decide.
- Dan.
Vincent wants you aboard the Palomino right away.
Let's go, Charlie.
I think I'll tag along.
This isn't our party.
Let's get outta here.
Reinhardt will solve the one final mystery that has eluded mankind.
Or he'll die in the attempt.
Alex, I'm beginning to feel you want to go with him.
On a glorious pilgrimage, straight into what may be the mind of God?
I do. I do.
"And darkness was upon the face of the deep.
And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
What an incredible sight.
I still haven't got used to it.
Where are the others?
- They were recalled to the ship.
- Recalled?
Didn't I say no more unescorted excursions?
Where was your communication?
Ah, the ESP you share with the robot.
Extraordinary.
Dr Durant.
- Yes, Doctor?
- These are all my formulas
I've compiled over the years.
I want you to take them back with you... and pass them on to others in case something might happen to me.
You can depend on me.
I also want you to monitor my flight.
Stay as long as you can at the event horizon.
There might be an Einstein-Rosen bridge to consider.
I will.
Believe me, I've been waiting a long time... for someone like you to record this moment.
Thank you, Doctor.
Then I'm ready.
Ready to embark on man's greatest journey.
Certainly his riskiest.
The risk is incidental compared to the possibility... to possess the great truth of the unknown.
There, long-cherished laws of nature... simply do not apply.
They vanish.
And life?
Life?
Life forever.
The officer the men trusted most was Frank McCrae.
- Kate's father.
- They turned to him when Dr Reinhardt ignored the orders to return home.
He tried to take control of the Cygnus.
Reinhardt called it mutiny and killed Mr McCrae.
- What became of the crew?
- They were captured by the sentry robots and are still on board.
- What?
- Where?
In the command tower, the power centre.
Robots, Mr Pizer, humanoid robots.
The most valuable thing in the universe... intelligent life, means nothing to Dr Reinhardt.
Without their wills, the crew became things he could command.
- That explains the funeral.
- Right.
And the limping robot you spotted.
Do you mean to tell me that there's actually a human body under that clothing?
Exactly, Mr Booth.
We can't just take off and leave these poor devils behind.
Harry, looks like we're gonna have to try your plan.
What? And end up just like the rest of the crew?
Why, if they couldn't pull it off, what chance do we have?
Captain, the damage is irreversible.
Death is their only release.
That's right. For God's sakes, Dan, we can't take on that mechanical army.
Captain, I was forced to destroy two sentry robots.
The others are searching now.
If they're found...
- Gotcha, Vincent.
Charlie, start the countdown.
- Right.
Vincent, tell Kate I want her and Alex back here on the double.
Fix navigational course.
You have achieved all this on your own, Dr Reinhardt... and you would have every right to reject the request of a comparative stranger, but...
What are you hoping for, Alex?
Immortality?
No, scientific truth.
Alex, we have to board right away.
They're waiting to blast off.
Prepare reactors!
Maximilian!
- How are your readings, Vincent?
- All systems are go, Mr Pizer.
Alex, I will not have you throwing your life away for this.
- He can do it. I know he can.
- Oh, God, Alex!
There's an entirely different world beyond that black hole... a point where time and space as we understand it no longer exists.
We will be the first to see it, to explore it, to experience it.
Damn it all, Dan! If we wait for Alex, we may be too late.
Don't you see?
He's hypnotized by that man.
- Vincent.
- Yes, Captain?
Tell Kate we want her back here fast, with or without Alex. Tell her why.
Reactors on.
He's going to do it.
He's going to do it!
He's really going to do it.
He'll kill us all if you don't get us outta here now, Holland.
He wants us out there to monitor his flight. We still have time.
You're gambling with our lives, but you're not gonna gamble with mine!
Shut up, Harry!
- Alex.
- R squared.
- Alex! Could I have a word with you?
- B plus...
B squared... over A squared, sine squared, data...
Do you remember what we were talking about the other day?
- We've gotta get out of here.
- I'm staying.
- Shh!
- Reinhardt is a murderer.
- What?
Yes. Those creatures...
Those aren't robots. They're...
They're humanoids. They're... They're what's left of the original crew.
What's wrong, Miss Kate?
You look ill.
Kate's upset because I've elected to stay with the Cygnus.
- I hope she's electing also to stay with us.
- No, I...
- What changed your mind?
- I'm not. I, uh...
The right moment to go into the black hole is now.
What are you doing?
He would be dead by now.
They all would be dead.
It was the only way to keep them alive.
One of my greatest achievements.
But you told us the crew had left the ship.
Some cause must have created all this.
But what caused that cause?
Come on, Kate.
Let's get you out of here.
Maximilian!
Alex!
You shouldn't have done that!
He was a good man.
Protect me from Maximilian.
If there's any justice at all, the black hole will be your grave.
Take the young lady to the hospital.
You're cleared for take-off, Captain.
Dr Durant and Dr McCrae
chose to remain aboard.
I told you! Alex bought Reinhardt's theory hook, line and sinker.
Dr Durant is dead.
Maximilian killed him. They are taking Dr Kate to the hospital.
Vincent, get old Bob to show us the quickest way there.
Maximilian?
Bring us about.
All right. We may have just enough time.
Don't wait too long.
Get off before the gravity pull is too strong, no matter what.
- Look, Dan, what if...
- No matter what, Charlie!
I wish you a safe voyage home, Mr Pizer.
Yeah, well, just make sure you get aboard in one piece!
The time has come to liquidate our guests.
Go, go.
- Keep coming, old-timer.
- You don't have to wait for me.
Fire thrusters.
That madman is headed straight for the black hole.
- What'll we do?
- We wait.
Hurry.
Charlie, Kate's okay.
We're on our way.
Well, it's about time.
How close can we cut it?
Tell the sentries to fire on any humanoids between Medical and Palomino.
- They're on to us.
- Well, at least it got us this far.
Start down.
All right, Vincent.
Let's make this one an end run.
We'll catch them in a crossfire.
Way to go, old Bob!
- Are you all right?
- The first fightin'
I've done in 30 years.
I only wish it'd been Reinhardt and Maximilian out there.
Your crack unit, outwitted and outfought... by some Earth robot and that antique from storage!
We cannot endanger the Cygnus by exploding them too soon.
Give them distance.
Then blow them out of the sky!
- Charlie, do you read me?
- Loud and clear, Dan.
Man the controls. Post Harry at the
hatch and give us exactly 60 seconds.
- Where are you?
- Side corridor near reception.
They got us pinned down, but we're gonna raise hell here in a second.
Start countin', Charlie.
Dan! Dan, are you all right?
Charlie, reversing last order.
Take her up now. Repeat, lift off.
- You heard the captain.
- You're pretty big on talking heroics, Harry. Let's see some.
- Oh, damn!
- Harry?
- Damn.
- You hit?
- My leg.
- How bad?
- Oh, uh... I-I think it's broken.
- Can you make it back to the ship?
- I think so.
All right, then. Harry, we're counting on you to make sure they don't get aboard.
- Right.
- Good.
- Way to go, Charlie.
- Hyah!
What's that idiot trying to do? Harry!
Oh, no.
Blow it apart before it hits us! Fire!
I should've known he was all talk, no guts, and locked him up.
- He may have done us a favour,
Charlie. At least we're alive.
- And where there's life...
I'm sure that's not what he had in mind.
He was trying to save his own skin.
There is a saying that you can't unscramble eggs.
A penny's worth of philosophy right now isn't gonna buy us out of this now, Vincent.
- A good offence is the best defence.
- And what?
Go after Reinhardt and turn the ship around? It's too late for all that.
- There is an alternative.
- The probe ship.
Vincent, you're a genius.
- A meteorite struck the ship, Captain.
- Let's go, let's go. Come on.
- Go.
A whole storm of them, Captain.
The black hole's dragging them in too.
We'll have to try the main corridor!
Get down!
Hang on, Kate.
Get down, Charlie!
- I got you, Bob.
- Let go, Captain! Save yourself!
- We've gotta keep moving!
- He's frozen.
- Come on! Hurry!
- All right, Charlie! Move it!
Keep going!
Increase power to maximum!
We are going through!
It's over. The storm's over.
Maximilian!
Prepare the probe ship.
Maximilian!
Help me! H-Help me!
Fools!
Listen to me!
Listen to me!
Help!
Listen, somebody!
H-Help me. Help. Help.
Vincent!
All light.
- We have to go.
- No. No, I can't make it.
My hover stabilization's gone.
My main circuit's blown, and both back-ups are failin'.
You can make it.
It's no use, Vincent.
My useful days are finished.
But part of me goes with ya.
We'll never be obsolete.
Carry on the tradition.
We're the best.
- Charlie!
- Help!
- No!
- Help!
- We better get the hell off!
The whole ship's breaking up!
- Everybody, sit tight.
Hang on! Lift-off!
Gravity force field is on!
Controls not responding.
Captain, the ship has been programmed.
To Reinhardt's course.
You mean we're going into the black hole?
- Yep.
- Let's pray he was a genius.
In, in, in, through, through, through... and beyond.
In, in, through, through, through and beyond.
Help me! Help me! Help me!
Help, help, help, help me, me!
Life? Life? Life? Life?
Life forever.
Reinhardt murdered my father, my father, father.
Where is he? Reinhardt murdered, murdered, murdered... murdered, murdered, murdered, murdered...
The black hole is pulling us in, pulling us in, pulling us in.
We could also be dead, could also be dead...
Be dead, be dead, be dead, be dead, be dead, be dead.
We're the best. We're the best.
We're the best. We're the best.
Vincent. The best, best, best, best, best.
We're the best. The best.
The best, the best.
- Christmas morning, Christmas morning.
- Our mission's finished.
- It's pulling us in, pulling us in.
- Christmas morning. Christmas...
- We are the best.
- Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!
- Pull up easy.
- The temperature in Newark is 54.
In Morristown it's 57, and in Asbury Park...
Saint Dominic's: $2,712.
Saint Michael's: $983.
What do you have on Saint Bartholomew?
- Fifty-eight.
George, what about Loyola?
All right, up against the wall!
What is this?
What's going on?
My dear friends, you have come together in this church... that the Lord may seal and strengthen your love... in the presence of the church's minister and this community.
Christ abundantly blesses you.
- Oh, my God!
- Get that money!
- What are you doing?
- Do you know whose parish this is?
Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.
May daily problems never cause you anxiety... or the desire for earthly possessions dominate your lives.
May you find happiness and satisfaction in your work.
Just kiss that pipe, boys.
Shut up!
You have declared your consent before the church.
May the Lord strengthen your consent and fill you with His blessings.
What God has joined man must not divide.
Leave the change alone!
- Don't touch it.
- Beautiful.
May Almighty God bless you.
The Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.
We've been hit!
Son of a bitch!
In the days I went a-courtin'
I was never tired of resortin'
To the ale house or the playhouse
And many's the house besides.
As sure as me name is Barney
I'll be off to "Californy".
Instead of diggin' praddies
I'll be diggin' lumps of coal.
- Don't get us glommed over.
- No way.
We've already got a driver in the car.
Keep it up.
Don't press me, pal.
Couldn't you have stopped him without doing that?
Shut your mouth before you get it.
- What do you mean?
- Just what I'm tellin' ya, hard on.
If you'd shoot a priest for $67,000, how much is my life worth?
Zero.
You're a piece of shit.
- You bastard!
- What are you doing?
Look out!
He's gone! He's gone!
We better leave 'em till the cops get here.
Ooh!
Call another ambulance.
- There's one in back.
- There's a guy in the car here.
Hurt awful bad.
Everybody stay out of the way and let these guys through.
Hey, Mickey, over here!
What's the latest on your brother,
Mr. Ricci?
- He's gonna be all right.
- That's fine. Thank God.
One of those pigs walked away from that accident.
His name is Jackie Scanlon.
He's a punk from Queens with the Donnelly mob.
Real piece of shit.
Mr. Ricci, everybody wants to help you on this.
The guy can't make a move.
He can't go nowheres.
Could be on his way to the moon by now.
We'll get the best, but it's gonna have to come from the outside... and it's gonna cost.
He robbed my church.
Shot my brother.
I don't care where he is or what it costs. I want his ass.
- You got a problem.
- Tell me about it.
- You're on the hit parade.
- What?
That priest you whacked was Carlo Ricci's brother.
Forget the heat. Ricci himself is out looking for you.
- I never carry a pistol.
- Want to tell him that in person?
Got any money?
Two thousand.
- How about a passport?
- What for?
For 2,000 I'll get you a passport.
- You mean out of the country?
- Uh-huh.
- Where?
- A good place to stay low.
Why?
It's a place nobody wants to look in.
It's covered, okay?
- Where am I going?
- Get a train in Baltimore.
Go to pier 47.
At customs, ask for Nat Glick.
Don't mention my name.
As of right now, I don't know you and I don't want to know you.
I owed you a favor.
This is it.
You gonna tell me where I'm going?
I swear to Christ, I don't know.
No!
Ramirez.
Serrano.
Marquez.
I am in transit.
Transito, me
- I am going to Managua.
- Ah, Managua. Si. Pase.
Can I get something to drink?
In the plane with my baggage.
I'm very thirsty.
Pase.
Forget it, pal.
Stop eating. A year's pay might get you a seat to the next rat hole. Come on.
I have three rooms.
One of them's taken.
I'll take it.
- For how long?
- Let's say a week.
How much do you suppose from here to Argentina?
An airline ticket costs 470 pesos.
Passports, maybe another thousand.
I have less than 100.
Everything I could save in a year.
My house, maybe for 600, if I could sell it.
Can you understand English?
Yes, I speak some.
- Want to travel away?
- Yes.
I can fix for you la capital.
- I want to go out of this country.
- Out of this country? Dificil.
Very difficult.
Impossible?
No, es posible.
Costoso.
¿Comprende? Cost much.
Understood.
I can fix for you to go out from the country.
- This reloj plus 1,000 pesos.
- I have only the watch.
Whiskey.
Danke shon.
- Put it on my account.
- Thank you.
During the work it's hotter.
- Yeah. I like a southern exposure.
- Yes.
I thought about it myself.
I understand you used to be in banking.
That's the rumor.
I had no idea
I was the subject of rumors.
Carlos used to be an ex Reichs Marschall.
Right, Carlos?
What is your profession, Mr...?
- Dominguez.
- Dominguez.
Ice hockey.
Read about this place in a travel brochure?
I heard it had a healthy climate.
Not what you expected.
It was exactly what I expected.
Juan Dominguez?
Aren't you the laborer,
Juan Dominguez?
No.
You don't understand, huh?
Let's see your identity card.
What?
The identity card you keep here.
Juan Dominguez, born November 1939... in Las Calumnas in this country.
That is you?
You don't look to me like you were born in Las Calumnas.
Because you don't even speak Spanish.
And because you are a filthy gringo asshole.
This is false.
It's a violation of the immigration laws.
Hey!
Do you have more?
That's it.
Okay, next time you pay.
You make three... we take one.
Understand?
Understood.
Okay.
I need my card.
I can't make shit without my card.
- I need that.
- Ah.
Adiós, senor Dominguez.
It should produce twice as much as this last zone that we come out of.
When can you get this one pinched off?
Our trucks have already been ordered.
They should be here.
Very professional.
Get it to the capital.
Maybe we'll get results.
The government's been told it was an accident.
What?
In this country, terrorists who blow up American oil wells are heroes.
We're paying that government to give us protection.
El presidente cannot risk his liberal image... by sending us troops to chase patriots.
Shit!
This is a telex from home responding to my report.
First part concerns... regret loss of life, etcetera, injuries and so on.
Apparently we have no insurance position because of the sabotage thing.
This is the part that concerns you.
"Limitations on production in recent months... due to acts of terrorism and political uncertainties... emphasize attention immediate supply obligations... with minimum concern R&D...
What is R & D?
Research and Development.
"Please apprise course of action soonest."
It's signed, "Weber."
Is that it?
Yes.
What are the immediate supply obligations?
One tanker, 16o, 000 barrels by the end of next month.
We need that well to fill it.
They'll have to delay it.
They can't.
Charter's running. If we have to take a loss that big... we might as well shut down now and save expenses.
I've seen worse.
Let's clear away that junk and blow her out.
This stuff is too dry to spark.
That stuff has been sitting for a year.
- It's worthless.
- What do you mean?
When it sits a long time without being turned... that liquid nitro seeps out of the sticks and into the bag.
If you give those cases any kind of a bump, it'll blow.
It's risky moving a case ten feet.
That fire's over 200 miles away.
If it were up there, could you use it?
We could boom-load a little at a time. Yes.
How you gonna get it there?
That's not your problem.
We'll get it there.
What do you think?
The major problem is the vibration.
This thing is like an egg beater.
No matter how we shock-mount something, it will have a severe lateral vibration.
I thought maybe you could swing-load it on a pallet.
Twenty feet down there's no vibration, but the problem is turbulence.
We might move it half a mile that way but not 200.
We've never had a flight here without some turbulence in it.
What are you saying?
Not with a chopper.
There's no way.
I'll double the amount if you can think of a way.
It's not the money. Nobody's gonna get into a chopper with that shit.
You need a suicide jockey.
We now need experienced truck drivers... men who are willing to do a dangerous job.
This job must be done... before we can reopen our gates and bring back full employment to you people.
The men who qualify will receive exceptional wages.
Only experienced truck drivers willing to risk their life can do it.
No one else should apply.
The company will pay 8,000 pesos to each driver.
Wait a minute!
Four men with enough guts... can save Poza Rica and your village!
- Stop at the bottom of the hill.
- I need to know the machine.
Pull over.
You crazy bastard!
Teamster?
Greyhound.
Serrano.
Dominguez.
Marquez.
Martinez.
We're carrying three cases each.
One is enough to blow your fire. Six cases will blow out the whole field.
You don't think all the trucks will make it. One of us is a backup.
We want double, and legal residence, or we don't drive.
You leave in four hours.
Only one machete?
How many would you like?
Have to put half the jungle underneath our wheels to get through the mud.
How many machetes you want us to carry?
Should be two.
Condensers. Points.
Floats. Filters.
Tape. Wire.
Channel locks.
Rags.
- Where's the rest of this cable?
- In the car.
Where the hell is the German?
She's got something for you.
What is it?
Marquez!
Marquez!
Murderer! Zionist!
I'll kill you!
What happened? What happened?
This Jew dog cut his throat!
No police.
Hold it! We lost a driver.
We need another one.
When the money's up,
I'm as good as any of you.
Where you from?
Listen, Pancho, I've been clocking you every second that you got into this town.
If you pick your nose in this truck, clear it with me first... or I'll take you and this nitro into a ditch.
They've had 15 minutes.
Yes.
One moment.
I have a letter.
- I wonder if you would post it for me?
- Paris.
- That could take a month.
- Yes.
- Just keep it for me.
- I'll take care of it.
Get outta there!
Get the hell outta there!
I guide you.
No. You drive, and I guide you. Okay?
Get in the truck.
- Come on!
- No!
Come on!
Okay.
Is this the road to Poza Rica?
That's the wrong road.
I think this road's better for us because it's higher.
We take this one.
You don't understand. This road is too low. It goes through the swamp.
There's too much mud.
Can't you read a map?
We have no information on that road.
You're full of shit!
You take that road!
We follow the map.
It's the wrong road.
This is the wrong road!
Where the hell are you going?
We're going across that bridge... and you're going to guide me... because I can't do it alone.
They've had it.
We're sitting on double shares.
2o, 000 apiece!
No way they're gonna make that bridge, I'll tell ya that.
That's 2o, 000 apiece.
We're sitting on 2o, 000.
Double shares.
Come on!
Come on!
Stop! Stop!
Come on!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stay close!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Stop! Stop!
- Stop!
- I don't see you!
Stop! No!
Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!
No!
Are you all right?
The winch!
Get the winch!
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Come! Come!
Come, come!
Yes, come!
Come!
Come! Come! Come!
Come on! Come! Come!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
You're crazy.
It's eight trees!
No way.
Start chopping!
Make your move.
Kaoba.
Excellent wood.
We're going around it if we can hack out eight trees.
If you cut them down, how do you move them?
The winch.
How are you going to clear the stumps or drive through a swamp?
We're gonna go through it!
Impossible.
Impossible?
I think I can clear it.
Too small.
Show me your pockets.
Perfect.
Are you from Paris?
- I lived there. Yes.
- Where?
Do you know Paris?
I was there for two days.
- Very expensive.
- So they say.
Your family is there?
- My wife. Just my wife.
- No children?
No children.
I met my wife... when I first came to Paris.
The day she gave me this was the last day I saw her.
It's five minutes before 9:00 in Paris.
Dominguez.
Get down.
Get down on the ground!
What do you have in the truck?
Supplies.
What supplies?
Vienna sausage.
Wonder bread.
Northern Tissue.
Kleenex.
Nothing else?
Okay. So you got just what we need.
You don't have to be afraid from us.
Listen, amigo, just come out.
We just need this truck.
We need food, you know... and toilet paper.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
Talk to me!
What are you gonna do?
Get laid.
Best whore in Managua.
Two whores.
- Two best whores in Managua.
- You do it.
- Do it for me.
- With you, Pancho.
- You do it for me. Okay?
- I'll do it!
What do you mean you don't know?
Get a train down to Baltimore.
Go to pier 47.
Where am I goin'?
Where am I goin'?
Where am I goin'?
What do you mean you don't know?
- It's good.
- No good to me.
Do I take it to a bank, flash an I.D., give a thumbprint? Our deal was cash.
Head office is sending Gus Lefferts to meet you.
He'll take you to our bank. You'll have that cashed before supper.
Ask Lefferts what's available in the capital.
I told him you were a first-rate driver.
Not anymore.
Yeah, well.
Find anything good, send a postcard.
Maybe I'll join you.
You'd give all this up?
In six months time, who knows?
I may have no choice.
You know, there, uh...
There's one place down here... that might be nice for a guy in your situation.
Ever think of going to Managua?
Managua?
Shit! There's no way
I can go to Managua.
Too bad. It's a nice place.
No. Managua is no good for me.
Carlos, haben Sie scotch, bitte?
Oh, when you get into Bonao, would you mail that for me?
- Do I have a couple of minutes?
- For you, they'll hold the plane.
May I have this dance?
A fine clear morning and all is well.
Ahoy, there! Look up!
Fetch me a bow.
Look.
Captain! Captain Sinbad!
Up there in the sky.
It's holding something.
Abdullah.
It shines like gold.
Too strange to be an albatross.
A jackdaw?
They steal bright things.
No, too big for a jackdaw.
Omar!
You fool!
You have brought bad luck on us all!
Captain...
Cast it over the side. It is evil.
I feel it.
Captain!
For the love of Allah, cast it overboard.
I think I'll keep it.
Sinbad!
Sinbad!
Sinbad!
Sinbad!
- Captain!
- It's smashing us to pieces!
Can't hold her, Captain.
She's running before the wind. Look!
We're being driven on to the rocks.
Lash that sail!
Cut it adrift if you have to.
Abdullah!
Allah give me strength!
Sinbad!
Sinbad!
Marabia.
It must be Marabia.
We are way off course.
No. The dream I had, Rachid.
This it all part of it somehow.
We have been brought here by some mysterious force.
Is it not written -
- that a wise man will try to realize his dream, to follow it?
Some say that it is through dreams that Allah speaks to mortal man.
- To forsake the dream...
- Is to forsake Him.
Captain, he who walks on fire will burn his feet.
Captain?
I'm going ashore.
- Aye. There's a good anchorage beyond.
- And that's where we'll meet.
Do as he says!
We make for the anchorage!
You are Captain Sinbad?
I am.
You are also a thief.
And a thief is a king until he's caught.
The bauble that hangs at your throat is mine. Hand it to me.
Or you will have no throat.
You'll be dead if you don't.
You stole it from my courier.
Very well.
It's Koura! The black prince!
We have waited for you a long time.
He escaped, Achmed.
He rode into the city and escaped.
The Sultan's guards helped him.
But you are all right?
I brought the city gates down upon their foolish faces.
Master, your hand.
We must hurry, Achmed. He who searches for pearls should not sleep.
Sinbad is even now with the vizier.
I must hear what passes between them.
Walls have mice and mice have ears.
And I have my spy.
He has failed me once but never twice.
You tell a strange tale, Captain.
Nevertheless, one fact makes me believe your story.
The amulet around your neck.
It makes us allies against the same enemy -
- who covets it as much as I.
Fate, destiny have brought us together.
I would like to think so.
Why?
Our country is being choked by a great evil visited upon us by Prince Koura.
Koura?
The one who attacked me?
A man versed in every black art -
- and dedicated to bringing this domain under his power.
Please. I have an equally strange tale to tell.
When our Sultan died without a son, -
- he made me, his grand vizier, heir to two things.
The two being part of one great, mighty secret.
What are these two things you speak of?
You shall see.
Here is the first.
These pictures tell the story of a legend as yet unrealised.
Little remains, for even as our Sultan breathed his last breath, -
- and I hastened here to read the secrets, -
- a great ball of fire engulfed this room.
A fire which took my face -
- and left these few scorched patches that now you see.
- A ball of fire?
- It was Koura's work.
You spoke of two things bequeathed to you.
Here is the second.
Something the fire could not destroy.
A token. A sign. A riddle.
And it is said that the riddle will be unraveled -
- when this and the one about your neck -
- are placed before a great eminence who dwells in a temple of many faces.
And yet still incomplete.
A perfect match.
You see, I was right, Captain.
Destiny has brought you here.
But it is still a riddle.
These? This?
The key to a great and mighty secret?
What secret?
What is to be revealed?
Power. Absolute power.
Power to rid this land forever of
Koura's black and ugly ambitions.
- If this fell into Koura's hands...
- That thought constantly torments me.
If Koura were to obtain absolute power in this land, -
- freedom and happiness would be lost.
- Forever.
- Absolute power?
I pray to Allah, but he does not hear me.
Then you and I must see to it that we solve this mystery before Koura.
If Allah be willing.
Part of it must be here.
I see a ship. A long voyage.
- An island.
- And these foreboding symbols.
It can only mean danger of death.
Or great riches perhaps.
A lost treasure.
Or it could mean nothing at all.
The more I study it, the greater the puzzle becomes.
The golden tablets then.
What of these?
There is a third part still to be found.
It must be found, or our land will be plagued forever.
But how to get the third?
Vizier...
Don't you see it?
The meridian.
And there are shoals, an island.
It's a chart, Grand Vizier.
A nautical chart.
And you are a sea Captain.
Allah be praised!
You can go home.
- Is this a ship or a monastery?
- We sail with the tide.
She only removed two veils!
If the winds are with us, we'll reach this area before the rise of Venus.
And then we follow Orion into unknown waters.
- Why do you stare at me?
- Do you believe in destiny?
- That is what has brought us together.
- Possibly.
And with the help of Allah we will surely triumph.
There is an old proverb
I choose to believe.
"Trust in Allah, but tie up your camel."
It is Koura's spy. His watchdog.
Quick, quick!
There!
Already it may have betrayed us.
In the name of the Almighty, what was it?
Koura's creation.
A living homunculus.
An extension of his eyes and ears.
And with it -
- he now knows as much as we.
It's a race then. A duel.
We seek an island.
An ultimate destination.
He will also seek it.
Find me a ship and a Captain who can be trusted.
He must make ready to sail with the next tide.
All right, all right!
Excellent. You are even better than they say you are.
It is Sinbad, isn't it?
Captain of the ship that lies offshore?
I'm Hakim, owner of this aureate establishment.
I wish to employ you.
- Sorry, I sail with the tide.
- It is only a small service.
No longer than it takes to drink a coffee.
Please, just hear me.
It will only take a moment.
It's only a small service.
This is my son Haroun. A waster, a fool.
200 gold coins if you take him with you.
Take him with me?
- I couldn't even use him for ballast.
- 300 gold coins.
You cannot pick up two melons with one hand, and I cannot work miracles.
Hurry, hurry.
Come sit down.
- The girl...
- That girl? A worthless slave.
But you like her?
You view her with favour?
She's yours.
I give her freely. A gift.
Along with my son and 400 gold coins.
- What is your name?
- Margiana.
That mark.
- How did you get it?
- I've had it since I was a child.
- An evil eye.
- No, no.
It was tattooed on.
- Perhaps it is a good omen.
- It's to ward off evil spirits.
You have nothing else to tell me?
She is curvaceous.
Not deliciously fat as I prefer.
But at night a cotton seed is the same as a pearl.
- She finds favour in my eyes.
- Yes? It's a bargain.
The girl, my son and 400 gold coins.
- Allah will smile on you.
- More likely he will laugh at me.
Bring them to my ship.
It shall be done.
Very strange trip.
- Grand Vizier!
- Look what's coming aboard.
Salaam alaykum.
I've heard of gold going to a man's head, but this...
- Cast off.
- Cast off!
Cast off!
- Raise the sail up.
- Sail up!
Fair wind, Captain.
Aye. Fair wind and a fine one.
Every voyage has its own flavour.
- You know what is expected of you?
- Aye, my Lord.
In a few moments Sinbad's ship will come around that headland.
Follow him, Captain.
Gently, cunningly.
Keeping him always just within sight.
He who is patient obtains.
You're thinking the same as I, Rachid?
Captain, an island. If it is here, then it can only be one place.
- Lemuria.
- Lemuria?
The mythical island. Mariners have searched for it for centuries.
It is all that is left of a mighty continent now sunk beneath the waves.
It is a place of untold dangers, of death. They say...
That the man who fears the unknown will take fright of his own backside.
There you have it. We seek Lemuria.
We wager our skill against death.
And for rich reward. Find this island and a handsome prize awaits every man.
Are you with me?
To Lemuria!
And a bounty to boot!
- Even if it be into the jaws of hell?
- We cannot be bought, Captain.
Only with money.
Then be warned.
We can afford no laggards.
Every man must carry his own weight and more.
There's water everywhere!
- We're at sea!
- This boy is a genius.
I remember my father's shop and my father coming up...
Father! This was his idea, wasn't it?
A quick run around the harbour to clear the cobwebs away?
All right. The sea breeze is beautiful, cobwebs are all gone.
Now we can go home.
Sorry.
We are on course now.
- You are with us all the way.
- All the way?
Well, things could be worse. A couple of days away from home isn't too bad.
A couple of weeks?
A month?
- More than a month?
- Two, three years perhaps.
Two or three years?!
But I'll be an old man by then.
- Show me to my cabin so I can lie down.
- No cabin. You bunk with the men.
You want to eat, you work.
Work? Work?!
This is terrible!
Haroun.
You pace the deck like a caged beast.
For one who enjoys hashish you should be more at peace.
- I'll put you on watch.
- On watch?
All you have to do is sit down and keep a sharp lookout.
Sit down and look? Fine.
Haroun...
Up there.
That's where you sit.
I forget I have company.
Your pardon.
No, no. I am the one who bows.
You are my guest.
- But I am your slave.
- Slave? Up, up.
- You own me now.
- Own you?
No human being has the right to own another.
You are free now.
You belong to no one but yourself.
On this ship you are at no one's beck and call. You understand that?
Right. I go to change.
Fetch me a drink.
Please.
- You will be sleeping in here?
- Of course.
Captain Sinbad! Sinbad!
Aye?
Haroun saw a light on the horizon.
Over there.
- A ship.
- Following us?
- Stay on this course.
- Aye.
If she's still with us at daybreak, we know.
It is Koura.
Aye.
- I should come about and sink him.
- If he does not sink us first.
Sinbad has sent more pirates to the bottom of the sea than I can count.
There is much at stake, my friend.
We must maintain our lead.
With a ship like that?
We can't outrun him forever.
But if you can outwit him...
The cabin looks very neat.
You have all a woman's gifts.
- Yes, all of them. Save one.
- What is that? curiosity. You never ask why
I brought you along on this voyage.
I've only just become a free woman.
Slaves do not ask questions.
I'm happy you brought me along.
We're being hunted, pursued like prey.
And I must lose the hunter.
- Who pursues us?
- A man.
A great, black bat of a man.
He is one of the reasons you are here.
He, and that mark on your hand.
But why? Why?
I wish I knew myself.
Hold steady.
We lead him into this area of dense mist here.
There's enough rocks to snare a prow or rip open a keel.
But if you lead him there, you run the same risk yourself.
Not quite the same. I've navigated these waters before. Eh, Rachid?
Once before.
We'll abandon the chains!
How can he see to steer the ship?
It's terrible.
- How can he see anything?
- The Captain won't need to see.
He'll feel his way through.
Drop anchor!
Not yet. Pursue that ship!
Continue into this?
We will be wrecked.
- Well, Sinbad navigates these waters.
- Then he must have a chart to follow.
- Three points east.
- Aye, Captain.
As Allah wills.
It's alive! It's moving!
It's alive! It's alive!
For the love of Allah! The chart!
- It's taken the chart!
- Never mind. Fight it with fire.
Return. Return.
Return.
She's sunk.
Straight to the bottom.
- Impossible. Wood floats.
- The harpoon was made of iron.
- It took the chart.
- But I still carry the course.
Here.
Return...
Return.
Return... Return now.
Return!
To him who breathed life into you.
Return!
Return...
Master?
Master.
Your face... It's aged.
Master, you are ill.
You saw everything.
- I came when I heard your cry.
- Then you know.
- Enough, Master.
- Yes, yes...
You will die if you go on.
To summon the demons of darkness has a price.
And each time I call upon them, it consumes part of me.
Come, Achmed.
We have no time to lose.
Haul it aboard! Easy, easy.
Your sword.
Bring us back on course, Captain.
- You like the lute, Captain?
- Very much. Play me a tune sometime.
But I was playing a tune.
Land ho!
Lemuria.
Where we are destined to find our answer.
- We go ashore at daybreak!
- May good fortune accompany us.
The Captain reports we are well on course.
But there is no hope of overtaking Sinbad?
No matter, Achmed. I expected such a possibility. I am prepared for it.
Mandrake root and a few chemicals is all that is needed.
No! Don't throw stones in the well that you drink from.
Do you dare defy the demons of darkness?
I've watched them drain your strength.
Look! See what they have done to you already.
If you continue, you will perish before this journey is over.
Have you no faith in my powers?
We are soon to triumph, Achmed.
My life, my blood shall bring life.
Don't fear it, Achmed.
It is our friend.
Come on.
You will find Sinbad, my little friend. Seek him out.
Magic purges the soul, Achmed.
The night with its ears and the day with its eyes.
Come ashore.
There's someone moving.
Beckoning.
I didn't expect you to volunteer.
Any land is good for these legs.
Even dangerous land?
Dangerous? You never told me it would be dangerous.
You didn't ask.
To land on these shores is cause for celebration.
Have them return to the ship and see that every man gets wine.
I know you propose we go alone into this place. But just the two of us?
We shall not lack for protection,
Achmed. We shall not lack for that.
Stop!
Sinbad, look!
Your courage has deserted you?
Me? No.
My heart is full of bravery.
But I have cowardly legs.
As it was written:
A temple with many faces.
The temple of the Oracle of All Knowledge.
But I never thought to stand here.
We must seek out the great eminence.
- Is it the oracle?
- No, a guardian.
The keeper to whom we should present ourselves.
I bring you a token.
A sign from the sultans of Marabia.
We come humbly seeking the Oracle of All Knowledge.
Two golden tablets that fit as one.
Two tablets brought forth to the light, yet a third remains from sight.
A third?
A final place must still be found, a place that lies deep below the ground.
- He talks in riddles.
- No race is lost until it's won.
And close behind you comes the black and evil son.
Spawned by the Devil, suckled upon black milk, in human form. clad in robes of silk.
Destiny, destiny.
Destiny is invisible yet visible, and men may try to hide.
Yet its waters mark you clearly like a rainbow in the sky.
Destiny is a place where both good and evil wait.
And yet their very equality negates their power.
For it is the very deeds of weak and mortal men -
- that may tip the scales one way or the other.
And then the world shall know, and you shall know -
- which way the Fates have chosen you shall go.
Go!
Go now!
- Go?
- Go north.
North to barren lands of pagan places and pagan bands.
Before a goddess cast with many limbs.
And death to all intruders is their whim.
In that sacred place -
- hid from the eyes of man is the third gold tablet -
- that completes the plan.
Go now.
Go now.
Go north... Go north...
Back! Go back!
Go! Down here! Inside!
Captain!
The entrance is blocked!
Farewell, Sinbad.
Perhaps it is our destiny to be buried alive.
A man's destiny lies in his own hands.
A live dog is better than a dead lion.
Rachid, your bow.
All of you, your turbans and sashes.
Make a strong rope.
I knew we'd go mad down here eventually.
An arrow.
A straight, sure arrow.
A strong rope.
Come on, men. Trust in Allah.
But tie up your camel.
Do as he says.
Your turbans and sashes.
Hurry, hurry!
Tie strong.
Strong.
Good, good.
Rachid.
Sinbad, you've done it!
- I'm the lightest.
- But I'm the most foolhardy.
- Easy, Captain.
- He's going too fast.
Up you go.
Go on, Captain.
Sinbad, look out!
What is it, Master?
All of you, up you come.
Margiana first.
Moving north.
- It is as the oracle said.
- There's a steep climb ahead.
What is it, Master?
They mean to sacrifice us to their living god. Don't!
O mighty Kali.
Mightier than thou am I.
Make obeisance to me!
Dance! Dance for me!
Stop!
- Achmed...
- Master?
I shall remain and commune with their deity. Go!
Go now.
In that sacred place hid from the eyes of man is the third gold tablet.
The third tablet is here somewhere.
And I shall find it.
I shall find it!
I won't be denied! I won't!
Koura!
We meet again.
- To the death.
- To the death.
To the death, Kali.
Death to our enemy.
No, wait! Don't!
Stay back!
Stand clear!
The third golden tablet.
Here it is written -
- that the Fountain of Destiny lies within easy march.
Yes. Where the gods smile upon mortal men.
But I shall not enter that hallowed place empty-handed.
For it is also written -
- that he who places these tablets into the waters of the fountain -
- shall receive in turn:
Youth.
A shield of darkness.
And best of all:
A crown of untold riches.
All this is my destiny.
But I fear your destiny lies before you.
Have you not destroyed their shrine?
May Allah receive you.
I bid you farewell.
Their journey is over and mine almost.
Return to the ship, Achmed.
- To hear is to obey, Master.
- Have the crew make ready to leave.
Sire.
They think she is one of their own.
A goddess. We are saved.
No, she is the chosen one of their God of the Single Eye.
- Sinbad!
- Margiana!
Vizier, take off your mask.
Uncover your face!
Sinbad!
Into the tunnel! This way!
Rachid, over there.
Vizier, in there.
We must find Margiana.
Let them sustain me!
Margiana? Margiana?
The Fountain of Destiny.
The final place.
Margiana... come.
You followed me instead of Koura?
- Then he has won this race.
- The race perhaps.
- And the prize?
- Not the prize.
- A crown of untold riches...
- I regret nothing.
Frightened you, huh?
Margiana?
The final place.
The energy of youth is mine again.
You are too late, Sinbad.
The shield of darkness, a crown of many riches. I'll deny you these.
O gods and demons of darkness!
Rid me forever of this enemy -
- who stands between me and my destiny! I'll plead!
- They don't hear you, Koura.
- I implore!
Kill him!
Destroy Sinbad!
It is as the oracle foretold.
The forces of good and evil battling eternally.
It also foretold that it is the deeds of weak and mortal men.
That may tip the scales one way or the other.
Rachid!
Sinbad!
No!
Oh no!
And now, Sinbad...
- A shield of darkness shall be mine.
- I see no shield.
You will.
Look carefully, Sinbad.
What you cannot see, you cannot kill.
I congratulate you, Captain.
Your sword arm is excellent, but your eyes betray you.
For now you cannot see me at all.
For all your strength you are helpless.
As helpless as a child.
I can kill you any time, Captain.
Any time.
Am I here?
Or right beside you?
No...
You cannot kill me.
But I can destroy you. All of you.
Sinbad!
A crown of untold riches.
Your Majesty.
Are you not the true and worthy successor to the throne of Marabia?
And has not Allah delivered this -
- into my hands from the wondrous waters of the Fountain of Destiny -
- to rest upon your head?
Praise be to Allah the All-merciful.
I can't understand.
Sinbad, why did you do it?
Give away a whole kingdom, priceless treasure. Why?
I value freedom.
A king is never truly free.
Why, he is even told who he must marry.
Captain! Captain!
Will you take me on as a fully-fledged seaman now?
Aye. And make yourself fast with that rope.
Don't worry.
I always trust in Allah.
But tie up your camel.

Only use it as a last resort.
When all else is failed.
- It has served me well, as you can see.
- Yes, father.
- Won't you sit down?
- No. Time is short.
You must be off.
I've given you my secret thrust.
I give you at least 15 crowns.
And this.
Your grandfather bought this sword against the Moors of Lepanto.
I made some use of it.
Under the late King Henry.
Now it is yours.
It'll introduce you to Monsieur Treville, who commands the King's musketeers.
He will remember it well.
And me.
My son, you're going to be a musketeer.
You are young, brave and a Gascon and a D'Artagnan.
Fights, whenever you can.
Never submit to insults... except from the King and Cardinal Richelieu.
Now be weary of the Cardinal, for he rules France through the King.
But you are a King's man, and the Queen.
So...
Now, go and say goodbye to your mother.
Your ointment is in pack.
Rub it well to every scratches.
And dry your cloak and your shoes well. / Yes, mother.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, father.
Don't sell the horse.
Let him die honorably of old age!
And fight, remember!
Take care.
Come on!
As someone probably rides on a buttercup.
Perhaps it is a cheese with legs.
Tell me what you're laugh at.
Then we'll laugh together.
If you were a gentleman,
I would speak to you.
But I am speaking to you!
Turn, if you are a man!
He is a Gascon. /
Should I kill him? / No.
Put him on his ridiculous horse and let him go.
No time to talk, My Lady.
The cardinal command you to England.
Let him know when the Duke is leaving.
- And then?
- Awaits his further commands.
And you? When shall I see you again?
You... You assassin!
I shall chastise you, Sir.
Forgive me, Madame.
But, I must kill your friend.
Are you not terrified?
Away, pumpkin!
You will hear from me.
He's very handsome.
Claude, pay the bill!
You...
Where is Monsieur Treville?
/ Upstairs. / Thank you.
I like the belt buckles.
I am a man of his money at night spends precious shirts.
Or one's mistresses money.
No, my own.
I paid with 12 pistoles.
It is golden belt.
Astonishing! There's enough gold in France to stretch so much?
Might I lift the cloak?
- No, I have a cold.
Discretion is being a part of vanity.
I don't understand.
I know the one about valor, but in such clothing
I can not be prudent.
A very clean sword thrust. A souvenir from... the Cardinal's guard.
- You're a liar. It's a smallpox.
If one sees... / Don't pretend you know to make any difference to the treatment.
Monsieur Treville will see you now.
Thank you.
Your father says that you carry his old sword.
Yes.
Do me the honor of taking one arms, 'till yours grow longer.
Sir, I ask charity of no one.
Then you aren't likely to get it.
No, not charity, but love and courtesy for the son of an old friend.
To keep his enemies further off.
In that case, sir.
I bid thank you.
That is as much as
I can offer you.
You see, there is no place in the musketeers for any man... untill he has serve in a campaign or distinguish himself in the killing.
But, what I can do is write a letter to Monsieur de Salle, who commands the guards.
You coward! I spit on you!
What?
Not on you, Sir.
On that fellow, without the eye!
You, Sir! I said stop, Sir!
Excuse me, I'm in a hurry!
- You're certainly in a hurry.
You hurdled into me and expect an excuse is sufficient?
You need a lesson in manners.
I said "excuse me".
I need no lesson in manners.
You shall have one anyway.
Where?
The Carmelite convent, at twelve.
- Gold all the way around.
- Stop! You run with your eyes shut!
- Sir, I beg your pardon.
- I demand satisfaction.
Where?
- At the Luxembourg, one o'clock.
Oh, look... at the statue.
Forgive me, gentlemen.
- You drop this.
- Gold departing from departing pansy!
That's not mine.
Pardon, I saw it fall.
You see too much, it is a fault among peasant.
- I am a Gascon, Sir.
- And need to learn civilized behavior.
I am no bully, as a future priest
I fight only if I must.
But you have compromised a lady.
Shall we say at Hotel
Treville, two o'clock? / Sir!
Sir, your purse!
Well, if I'm to be killed, at least by the hand of a musketeer.
You're punctual.
Even though you're not running.
But you did hurt my shoulder.
I trust it will not inconvenient you, Sir.
If you wish to postpone...
By all means. I fight just as well with my left hand.
If you find this places you to a disadvantage, I do apologize.
You're very courteous, Sir.
About your wound, I have an ointment from my mother.
You overwhelmed me, young man.
Ah, here come my second.
You fight him? But I'm meeting him myself. / Not 'till one o'clock, sir.
No, I do! / At two. / How long you been in Paris?
- Since 8 o'clock this morning.
- You wasted no time.
My father recommended that I fight duels.
Let us hope you can do him some credits.
- The Cardinal's guard!
- Cease, quickly!
Ah, musketeers!
Dueling in defiance of the edicts.
This is a private matter.
Would you please be on your way.
We have a duty to suppress disorder...
...and arrest brawlers. Put up your sword and come along with us?
Impossible. / Unthinkable. / Unlikely.
Then we must charge you.
They are six and we are only three. / No... four.
You are not one of us.
This is not your affair, boy.
I may not have the tunic, but I have the heart of a musketeer!
Young man, you may retire.
Save your skin. And quickly.
What is your name?
/ D'Artagnan. / Well, then.
Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan!
Forward!
First, let us pray.
Gentle Jesus, meek and hard!
May I?
Sorry.
A sword!
For God's sake.
Thank you.
D'Artagnan!
No!
No! Leave him to me!
- Put down your sword!
- No!
Surrender, Biscart! I order you.
Oh, that's different.
Ring the bell.
The nuns will tend to your wounded.
Come, the sooner we go, the better. / Yes, it was over too soon.
Look at that best flemish velvet!
Ruined by you!
You will pay for it!
10 pistole it costs me!
No, 20 pistole. And 20 more as a fine, to teach you manners!
Thief!
Charity is one of cardinal virtue!
Are we going to stand here and chat, until marshal comes to arrest us? Go!
Let's be off.
About your friend's wounds...
I have an ointment from my mother.
You might find it effective...
I threw my sword in the air...
- Porthos! Porthos!
The purse, please. The Musketeers motto: One for all and all for one.
Which loosely translate as 10 for him,
10 for him, 10 for you and 10 for me.
My dear Aramis needs 10, to impress his mistress.
My good Porthos needs 10, to enable himself to dress decently.
And you need 10 for lodging and a servant.
- And I...
- And you?
I need a drink.
The future looks rosier from the bottom of a glass.
Mind, where...
This is a horse?
This is the steps.
I think you'll like it here, monsieur.
For only two francs a day... this chamber here... wonderful.
And scrupulously clean, as you see.
Slopped empty every second day.
And more redundant on a modest fee.
You're rascal can sleep out there.
If you beat him for insolence, the scream will scarce be heard.
They don't fallof tree, chamber like this in Paris.
Where else you get a magnificent view of the city?
Honestly, this pig sty is not fit for... a king or cardinal.
But it will suits me very well.
Two francs, you say?
You take it?
- Whenever it's offered.
My wife, sir!
Is she not beautiful?
- Enchanting.
Thank you. / She is as delicate as petals falling...
From afar!
You know, my wife is the dressmaker to the Queen.
A very nice person, the Queen.
My wife has her every confidence.
I am very proud of being her husband.
She lives here?
- No, I live here.
My beautiful Constance stays at the palace. Where else?
She visited me once a week.
Tonight, in fact.
Madame must look forward to that eagerly.
Yes.
Faster!
Faster, you idiot!
Come on! Somebody, make it faster!
Wonderful! It is really wonderful.
I feel sick.
The queen to king's knight 4.
Your ruffians have spite the Cardinal's guard.
Your Musketeers, sire.
- Your ruffians.
Knight to king's bishop five
I am hard put to explain it to him, who guards France while I sleep, and works tirelessly while
I amused myself.
Your Majesty refers to God?
- I refer to Cardinal Richelieu, which is not quite the same thing.
Oh, Cardinal...
This matter of Treville's musketeers...
Broken heads and broken swords.
Trifles, Sire. The Duke of
Buckingham is in Paris.
Buckingham? Here?
Why, in God's name?
To plot against my honor?
- The Queen.
You will arrest the plotter.
- Sire, you are off.
The Queen is faithful to you and to France. She loves you warmly.
I am not scorched by the heat.
You arrest him.
What a scandal should we do that?
Arrest the prime minister of England?
No, Sire. What we must do is keep the noble Duke on a string, to pursue his sordid pact with Protestants his politics muffled in a cloak.
And the Queen muffled in her cloak, under the window?
Her majesty beauty attracts all manners of worship... and worshippers.
But her virtue is beyond question.
As for the Duke of Buckingham, he will be watched.
Bishop to queen two.
Chess.
That one.
Open up! Open up!
Or else, we break it down!
Don't worry, Constance!
- Oh, my darling!
You will come with me.
- No, I won't.
No, I won't.
We'll see about that.
We'll see about that.
You will come with me.
- Yes, I... I'll come with you.
Stop her! Stop her!
What have you done with my wife?
Monsieur D'Artagnan, I want you... / I'm yours, as soon as I get my breathe back.
Did I hurt you?
Monsieur, I must get to the queen tonight.
- I can not allow it.
I was torn from my bed.
- The best place for you.
The bed is the best place for you.
Sit down.
Thank you, Monsieur.
- Oh! My husband.
- Where?
In the Bastille.
Oh, a... I'm sorry.
Now, the best possible course is a good night sleep. Try to forget about it.
I can not sleep, with my husband in the Bastille.
- I'm frightened.
- I'm not.
You want to sleep with me. You need a good cuddle to chase the fright away.
I must go to Her Majesty.
She needs me urgently.
I can not let you go.
The streets are full of dangers, and your legs and feet are dirty.
Yes.
You must help me. You are young and gallant. My husband is weak troubled with wind.
Can I tell you?
Can I trust you? / With your life which beats in your breast.
I hear the flutter of life like a little white bird.
I must be the queen.
- I can hear the wings.
The Cardinal wishes to ruined it.
Because I'm in the Queen's confidence..
Perhaps he hopes to attack her through me.
You can not go to the
Queen with dirty legs.
No.
Are you strong enough to wash them?
- No.
My poor husband, without him I feel so helpless.
I have never washed the legs of a woman.
I have done a horse.
With the horse, you start at the top.
I can not go dirty to the Queen.
Do you think I will be safe here?
Oh yes, Constance, yes...
Oh, it's...
...a bit cold.
At least let me escort you part of the way. / No, I must go alone.
I have to meet someone before
I go to the queen. / Who?
Are you jealous so soon?
Of every inch of you.
I must go now. Promise you won't follow.
Ouch!
Money for the blind man.
You all right, darling?
Money for a cripple...
Get off!
Money for a cripple!
Not your day, is it?
- Money for an orphan!
Money for a war veteran.
Money...
Before you climb out...
Sir, you have some change?
One moment, sir.
But you promised.
- I can see why you make me promised.
You have nothing to do with me.
- No, but with this lady.
Take my arm. Good evening, sir.
In God's name, my lord.
- My lord? Are you...
The Duke of Buckingham.
See? You will spoil everything!
- My darling, forgive me.
My Lord, what can I say?
I love her and was jealous.
A perfectly excellent reason for attacking a stranger in the dark.
Woud you oblige me with a small matter?
Anything, my lord.
- When we enter the palace, we must not be seen.
If anyone try to follow us, would you be good enough to kill him. Thank you.
Oh, yes... yes.
Does Your Grace know of any private place which as private as this public one?
- Well...
- Wait here!
Anne. / Why have you come?
/ To see you.
Oh, it is folly.
The king suspects... and the Cardinal knows.
He'll ruin me.
His spies are... what if they caught us?
- Decidedly we must not be found, not with the dirty laundry is washed.
It's hopeless.
I'm the wife of the king.
An ill mannered little Parisian lout to ignored you, & jealous at the same time?
What do you owe him?
I will not disgrace him.
Which is why I ask you to go and not to return.
We are not ordinary folk.
- Indeed.
It thrust both ways.
I am no little gentleman or a farm boy.
I am a master of a great state, Anne.
With great ships and armies, too, if need be.
The English have come to France before.
But never with a better reason than I have.
Do you think I would fret for a war to win you?
If you doubt it, wait 'till France claim to the throne of England raises.
Dear, dear Anne...
You look lovelier than...
...than everything I've seen in a laundry before.
Tell me again, that you love me.
You must go.
It's not safe here.
It will be one day.
Until then...
Give me something to remember you by.
A token, anything.
Oh, come. A farm boy sweetheart would give him one.
These are my best things.
Within a year I will bring them back to you.
So, that's how they do it!
At no notion, I should wear my shirt in the future with more respect.
Oh, God!
Go on! Quickly!
Stand still!
In here!
Excuse me!
Please tell me where are we going...
Dance, you rabbit! I'm not through with you! Come here!
Oh, thank you.
Come on!
Oh, my lord.
I probably could've manage, but my thanks to you gentlemen, anyway.
- Who was that?
- I don't know.
But he sounded a touch of foreign to me.
Look at this? What on earth was this all about?
In you go.
- I want you tell me,
I did nothing. I was lying in bed, alone when suddenly he break into my room.
I swear I've done nothing!
What will they do to me?
You are in the Bastille.
You must have done something.
What you have done is high treason.
You are accused of conspiring with your wife and the Duke of Buckingham.
No, no...
Do you know your accuser?
Who brought you here?
That is the man!
Take him away.
- That is not the man!
There's another man. This is a very honorable gentleman...
They have met, the Queen and
Buckingham. / Where? / At the Palace.
I learned too late. / He slipped through your finger? / Through yours.
I had no orders. / What happen? /
Madame Bonacieux accompanied Buckingham.
I told you to arrest and hold her.
I failed.
One does occasionally.
If I blundered as you do, my head would fall.
I would say, from a greater height than mine.
You would?
The height of ambition.
/ You have none? / No.
Do you fear me?
Yes, I fear you, Eminence.
I also hate you.
I love you, son.
Even when you fail.
The queen gave Buckingham the 12 diamonds studs.
The King gave her for her birthday.
Where went Buckingham, I do not know.
Spare me, not what you know.
Buckingham will be in Calais...
We let him go this time.
No... no... not break!
Let me go, please! Stop it!
It hurts!
It supposed to.
You have deceived me!
Deceived me!
For thinking of you were a traitor.
Rise, my friend.
What can I say?
I find that our suspicion about you were entirely unjust.
The Cardinal has taken my hand and called me "friend".
We must make you a better man than that. Take these 100 pistoles...
And forgive me.
- I forgive Your Eminence?
You can not mean that, I mean, what am I? I am nothing.
I am less than nothing.
Friend, you are generous.
Is not it? I hope you will come to visit me again, so that we can talk.
Until our next meeting.
I think I have done all that can be done with him.
I set him loose to spy on his wife.
- He think I was frightened of him?
The gallant Buckingham will most certainly wear those diamonds studs.
Send word to Milady de Winter in
England. She is to get close to him... and obtain two of the studs.
You go there to meet her and see that she brings them to me immediately.
How she gets them, is her affair.
You'll like this place.
It's very cheap.
Wait a minute.
I can win some money for us.
He's the one!
He will win!
Come on, boy!
- Then it's not enough for dinner.
I'm going to win here!
He's the one!
I am starved.
How about chicken? Always popular on Wednesday. / It's Tuesday.
Chops? / Oh, how revolting!
I long for good food.
Tell him to cook this, will you?
You great overgrown child!
I know what you are doing.
People like you, I know!
All right?
This should cover the inconvenience, Sir.
Oh, look at its feathers!
Did you hear it cry?
Have you heard?
His Eminence wants to see you dance.
He suggest that I give a Ball in your honor.
What pleases your majesty is a delight to me. / So, at the Hôtel de Ville then.
In two weeks. We should be merry.
Ball, Ballet, Costumes and figures and whatever.
And you'll be able to wear the diamonds studs that I gave you.
That will crown her majesty's evening.
The diamonds studs?
Yes, the studs, my present to you. Why not?
Do not you, that they are you? / Yes.
Yes, they are beautiful.
- Then I wish they're worn, then?
I wish you to wear them.
I depend upon it, madame.
This bird has got a grip on me.
It brought tears to my eyes, clinged to my wrist. See?
Oh, the ball with the diamonds...
You want to see the Queen's dance.
You becoming a romantic under your priestly robe.
Even a cardinal has weaknesses, your Majesty.
Whereas the king has none, eh? See the tears?
This conversation took place in the bedroom of Bonacieux at the palace.
The Queen said:
"I am lost, I am lost".
Bonacieux said: "Your Majesty."
"Constance, I am lost."
"Your Majesty."
"What can I do?"
"We can get the studs back". / "In
14 days? From London? I am lost".
"A messenger can reach London and return to Paris with the studs".
"A messenger, who? I can trust no one.
That devil has informants everywhere.
That evil, filthy, revolting, wretched man. Evil, filthy, revolting, evil man, calls himself a man of the church".
According to this.
I will find a messenger, Majesty.
I trust upon him. I swear it.
He can carry a letter from you to Lord Buckingham.
Yes, a letter.
I shall write it.
It's for my honor and for my life.
You've someone you can trust with that?
/ Your Majesty, he will not fail...
The Queen is in danger...
...unless this letter can be taken immediately to London.
If you could set out at once.
She has no one to trust but me.
And I can't trust no one but you.
Letters, dangers...
Come to bed,
Constance, my small chicken.
And I will...
I'll do anything you ask if you promise to take the letter.
What do I know about letters? I've been so many days and nights without you.
No, I'm serious...
- You think I'm not?
The letter must go to London now.
/ It must because you say so...
I don't wish to be trusted me... because that suspicious letter smacks of intrigue.
Constance, Constance...
Yes, intrigue.
What came out here?
I was dragged to the Bastille.
But I don't wish to be sent to the Bastille, because they got very deep dungeons and terrible instruments of torture, operated by very unsympathetic men.
They slit very important parts of people.
Hadn't been for the Cardinal...
The Cardinal?
- Yes, the Cardinal.
You think, you alone have friends in high places. Let me tell you...
The Cardinal took my hand and called me friend.
And he gave me this purse.
You were the cardinal?
- I tell you something else.
He doesn't like this kind of intrigue.
To whom is that the letter go?
It's nothing to you if you do not wish to carry it.
Very well, madam mischief.
If you don't wish to go to bed with me,
I shall have to leave you.
For a very important appointment.
For a very important appointment!
- Oh, you!
- Me.
Then you heard? / Every word. / Then you know.
You and the Queen, you need someone who is gallant, courageous, discreet, active, smart and loyal is.
I also know the way to London... and your good husband, whose probably on his way to the Cardinal, has thoughtfully provided my expenses.
- Can I trust you?
- Trust me?
Trust me? Oh, the question!
You can trust me because I love you.
And you love me. If not, there's something wrong with you.
You must swear never to reveal the name of the person to whom it goes.
On my honor.
His name is the Duke of Buckingham.
This way, sir!
He moves quickly, that husband of yours!
...happened all the time.
Constance! Constance!
She's gone.
As you might've known, you're an imbecile, and not accept the letter.
She has doubtly fled to the palace.
None here. The candle is still warm.
- Quick to the palace!
She can't be gone far.
This letter, have your wife mentioned... the Duke of Buckingham?
- No, no names.
This D'Artagnan lodges with you, does he not?
We shall find a lodging for D'Artagnan
& his friends as a precautions.
In the Bastille.
- And afterwards?
In the Bastille there is no "Afterwards".
What?
That man has insulted me, broke my father's sword, had me club to the ground and laid violent hands on the woman I love.
He is... inconvenient.
Let me tell you something about this,
"inconvenient" gentleman of yours.
His name is Rochefort.
He's the the Cardinal's living blade and he's deadly.
Now running already, you slow oaf!
Still 15th
15 both.
If you see Rochefort on the street, do not make the effort, to greet him.
Aramis! What the hell are you doing?
Your only chance.
- A full risk.
Rochefort or not, I have to get to London with this letter.
For the Queen. I must be back with the answer in 14 days.
With Cardinal's friend hunting you, you won't get five miles.
Game. Final set.
You want this letter delivered?
If the four of us go, it should get there.
There goes tomorrow's dinner, sir.
Wager on a Huguenot for Papacy than on you two. Get your things.
We're riding to London.
- London?
Great lump of bollock indeed?
Your soul is corrupted. You shall not inherite the kingdom of God.
- When do we leave?
- At once.
How do we get horses?
- We sell our servants.
A servant sells his secrets,
Gentleman one before.
If one of us falls, take the other three the letter.
Who falls, must take his chances.
Agreed?
No one asked delicately the cause in which we're being expected to die?
When on a campaign, does the king gives his reason? If we have to fight, we fight.
Then let's go & be killed as we're told. Is life worth so many questions?
Be careful with the bridle!
Has cost more than you deserve.
I'll go, sir. / God be with you, sir! / And you, too.
- We toast, sir?
- With pleasure.
Will you drink to health of the Cardinal?
Gladly, if you drink with us on the king.
Not on the king.
On the Cardinal.
You're drunk, sir.
There's only one answer for that.
This you will owe me one!
This is your folly. Kill the fellow and follow us as soon as you can.
Come on!
We are down to three. / Porthos can take him out. The guy's drunk.
He looks sober enough when he came en guard.
Damn! Look here!
Stop! Stop!
Get away! Ride out!
Come on!
Come on!
Drop it!
The same fate awaits us perhaps ten miles further.
But at least we should be safe enough to run. Forward!
Treason it may be,
But I will retain the beauty of
French women above all others.
An Englishman can never believe you.
Go to bed, Felton!
This expression could every man prepare nightmares.
I can take anyone if you have pass from the Cardinal.
I have a pass.
This morning that no one should leave without the signature of the Mayor master builder.
Very well.
I'll be back in an hour.
Keep a close watch. Enemies of the state were trying to escape.
You could do me a favor, sir.
That pass in your pocket. Hand it over, save us a great deal of inconvenient.
You were the Gascon rascall with a yellow horse, on the streets with the musketeers rumlungert corners and beating.
The street corners you've been careful to avoid, Monsieur Cyclops.
Where are your three accomplices?
You would've done been better...
It's me!
Don't worry, sir. I'm coming.
I'm coming!
I've told you.
Monsieur, are you killed?
Not quite.
Just a scrape along the ribs.
Oh, Father! What you almost did to your son.
Is he dead?
Alas, he's only stunned.
Shall I kill him?
Certainly not.
Ties his wrists and gag him.
We give him the chance to bleed to death, but we're not murdering him.
The pass is only for one.
- I am only one.
- That is a servant.
- Okay.
You alright?
Look, will you? Dover!
My lord!
So, it's the jealous lover.
I trust you haven't come to England to fasten another quarrel on me?
I'm afraid I can not read.
How long have you been on the road?
- Six days, my lord.
Then so, we must bustle!
Come on, Plachet, we must bustle.
Oh, good. I like bustling.
Go, sir! At the gallop!
One, two...
Yes, sir.
She is my deity.
Here they are.
I hoped to keep them always.
God in heaven, two are missing!
/ What? / Let me think.
I had all twelve at the ball two weeks ago...
Countess de Winter.
My God!
A pretty price for the infidelity.
You should be in France by now.
Felton!
They had been stolen by a Cardinal's spy!
Felton, my secretary!
I want to place an order.
Someone got a pen?
Write to all ports on the canal!
No vessels to sail without my order!
If the king asks, tell him I'm... thinking of war with France.
And keep the road to Dover clear!
Six days?
You shall kill yourself return this studs to Queen in time.
But the missing ones? / O'Reilly, put a price on these, each one. Their worth?
Something is missing... and there.
I'd say... 500 pounds.
How long to make two of them?
A week? / I'll pay 5,000 each, if they're finish the day after tomorrow.
Done. Could I tell my wife, I'm not coming home?
I'll do better. Jackson, a carriage and escort of cavalry for Mrs. O'Reilly..
Prepare room for them.
- Oh, how nice.
Have you hurt yourself?
- It's nothing.
Beautiful, beautiful.
Would it be a compliment to say they match your eyes?
Unusually gallantry.
Your normal humour, would be to compare them to my heart.
It did occur to me.
Up the Cardinal, down the Queen.
Whip it!
There, sir. Pick out O'Reilly's two new ones if you can.
And now, for the honor of the great lady whom we both serve...
...is for you to see that she receive them in time.
My lord, it is done already.
- And you, sir.
How can I ever repay you?
Let us understand one another...
You are an Englishman, an enemy of France.
You owe me nothing yet,
I did it for the Queen.
And for another who is dear to me as the Queen is to you.
I take my leave.
I forgot that England is an island. How do I get off?
You'll find fresh horses, and a clear road to Dover, and waits for a ship.
Monsieur, you would take no reward from a friend.
Will you at least accept this?
And this, from an enemy.
That is different.
I'm tired!
- Me too. We're almost there.
Put your back into it!
- I got piles!
We need fresh horses. / Do you recognize this place? / No.
The last place on earth we were all alive together.
Until we meet again, my friends!
That will not last long.
Get me out of here!
Look! The rope. Quickly!
The horse!
For God's sake, where are you?
Through the gate!
These horses are done.
It's about time!
Come on! / Show off! / Why you always lagging behind?
Did you hear that voice?
- That unfortunate accent!
All for one and one for all.
My wife's in there.
She dances with all the best people.
And sometimes she waves at me. Sometimes.
Madame, why are you not wearing the diamond studs?
You knew that I wishes to see them.
Your Majesty, in this big crowds I fear I might lose them.
You were wrong.
I made you this present...
...to adore yourself.
I am highly displeased.
If Your Majesty pleases,
I can send to the palace for them.
Do so. And immediately.
Keep going, Reggie. It's filling up.
I'm doing my best.
- Not good enough.
Her Majesty was radiantly pale.
May I respectfully direct Your Majesty's attention to these sweets in this box?
I feel sure you would agree, they are at royal confection.
What does this mean? / If the
Queen has her studs, which I doubt,
Count them, Sire.
If there are only ten, asked Her Majesty where the other two.
No one may enter without an invitation.
It's the Cardinal's order.
I beg your pardon, sir?
I said...
Doesn't matter.
Come on. That's it.
Come on! That's good.
Again!
Madame, he may still come.
I feel sure he will.
How can he, Constance.
It's no use.
It's over. It's...
That has to be Constance.
Light the fireworks, when you hear the fanfare.
- D'Artagnan!
- What?
I'm almost there, Constance.
Come down there!
Sorry.
Why are we stopping, gentlemen?
Hurry! / I am hurrying!
Stand fast, boy!
Blast!
Come on!
Guards! After him!
Follow that bear!
There you are, my old friends!
Here are your men to the rescue!
Thank God, you're all alive!
Can you get me up there, please?
Wait a minute...
He tore up our carpet.
Quickly, gentlemen! To your places!
Three, four, five... silly me!
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three, four...
Stand still!
Get off! Come!
Excuse me, please?
Thank you, for adhering my wishes.
But I believe you've lost two studs.
I'll bring them to you.
Sire, you bring me two more.
How kind of you. Now I have fourteen.
13, 14.. What does this mean, Cardinal?
It means, sire, that...
...I wished to present those studs to
Her Majesty, but not dare to offer them.
I gave them to her through you.
I'm terribly grateful to your Eminence.
For I'm certain that these two studs cost you much more than the other twelve, cost by His Majesty.
Eminence, D'Artagnan gain entry to the hotel. / Quite so.
You failed me.
I've lost points.
The game continues.
- You would not seek this boy?
To what end? Vengeance?
That is an expensive luxury.
Statesmen can not afford it.
No, I could use such a man.
Perhaps I shall seek him out after all.
Your Eminence is a great player, great enough to lose.
I do not like to lose.
You must suit yourself, my lady.
But if in the end you should, do it with becoming grace.
My darling, darling.
Never again will I let you go in such terrible danger.
Time gallop, sometimes fighting, stab times. What the hell!
It's the day's work.
But to find my beautiful
Constance in the end...
Did you miss me?
A foolish question.
I work for him.
Yes.
Young Gascon, now you're a musketeer.
Carry the King's musket with honor.
Now that you are the... four musketeers.
Now we're four.
My boss. He waves to you.
Here, take it!
The King!
It's still on, and we're going.
Cyrus sent an emissary this afternoon to make sure.
Now, Cyrus don't want anybody packed.
He don't want anybody flexing any muscle.
I gave him my word that the Warriors would uphold the truce.
Everybody says that Cyrus is the one and only.
I think we'd better go have a look for ourself.
- We ain't been to the Bronx before.
- No sweat.
This conclave's gonna be a real big item.
Every gang in the city is gonna be there.
We're going in with nothing.
We're going in there like everybody else.
Nine guys, no weapons.
You got the stuff?
I want you to hit everything in sight.
I want everybody to know the Warriors were there.
You never know what's out there.
- Wearing our colors, we can't hide.
- Who wants to hide?
Maybe we'll get to waste a few heads along the way.
You just soldier and keep your mouth shut.
When we get there, you stick close by, okay?
Don't worry.
I don't feel like getting wrecked.
One thing we might get out of Cyrus' little get-together...
...is meeting some strange wool.
I wouldn't mind laying something down on the way back.
You got a one-track brain, you know that?
What's the matter?
You going faggot?
What do you know about Cyrus?
Magic.
A whole lot of magic.
- What do you know about Cyrus?
- He's the one and only.
When you're president of the biggest gang in the city, you don't have to take any shit.
Fuck him.
I'll tell you something,
I'll bet nobody's even gonna be there.
Can you count, suckers?!
I say the future is ours...
...if you can count!
- Come on, Cyrus, we're with you!
- Go ahead, bro!
Now, look what we have here before us.
We've got the Saracens...
...sitting next to the Jones Street Boys.
We've got the Moon Runners...
...right by the Van Courtland Rangers.
Nobody is wasting nobody.
That...
...is a miracle.
And miracles is the way things ought to be.
- Yeah!
- I heard that!
- I heard that.
- Come get answered!
You're standing right now with nine delegates from 100 gangs.
And there's over 100 more.
That's 20,000 hard-core members.
Forty thousand, counting affiliates, and 20,000 more, not organized but ready to fight.
Sixty thousand soldiers.
Now, there ain't but 20,000 police in the whole town. Can you dig it?
Can you dig it?
- Can you dig it?
- Yeah!
Now here's the sum total.
One gang could run this city.
One gang.
Nothing would move without us allowing it to happen.
We could tax the crime syndicates, the police, because we got the streets, suckers!
Can you dig it?
Right on!
The problem in the past has been the man turning us against one another.
We have been unable to see the truth, because we've been fighting for 10 square feet of ground, our turf, our little piece of turf.
That's crap, brothers.
The turf is ours by right because it's our turn.
All we have to do is keep up the general truce.
We take over one borough at a time.
Secure our territory, secure our turf because it's all our turf.
The other way, against the crowd!
And keep your ass down!
Down!
Get out of the way.
They'll kill us all. Watch out, man.
Watch his head.
There wasn't supposed to be no guns!
Come on, move it!
- Is Cleon all right?
- He's up there.
- Are you sure?
- No.
Come on! Move it!
There he is! That's him!
That's the Warrior!
- He shot Cyrus!
- Man, you're crazy. I didn't do nothing.
- We saw him!
- Yeah, that's him.
He's the one. He's the one!
The Warriors did it!
The Warriors did it!
The Warriors did it!
The Warriors did it!
The Warriors did it!
Kill him!
Down. Everybody down!
- Shit!
- You all right?
Yeah.
Everybody quiet.
Everybody make it?
Just Cleon's missing.
- Fuzz must've got him.
- Did you see him get busted?
I seen him, then he wasn't there no more.
I was hauling ass.
Why don't you look around, make sure we're okay.
This is a graveyard.
What are we gonna do now?
We're going back.
You mind telling us how?
Fucking Coney Island must be
50 to 100 miles from here.
- It's the only choice we got.
- Yeah, real simple.
Except that every cop in the city is looking to bust our heads.
- We got something to think about.
- Yeah? What?
The truce.
Is it still on?
If it ain't, we're gonna have to bop our way back.
Shit, I wish we was packed.
If this truce is off, anything could hit us between here and that train.
If you get separated, make it to the platform at Union Square.
- That's where we change trains.
- I only got one question:
Who named you leader?
I got as much right to take over as you.
It was Cleon's choice.
Swan's war chief.
Right now Cleon's most likely got a nightstick shoved halfway up his ass.
Shit. I bet you can't even find the subway.
Maybe we ought to talk about this later, huh?
Well, what's wrong with right now?
I wanna be warlord.
Make your move.
- Hey, Ajax, lighten up.
- Big boy, Swan's war chief.
We better stick together.
Hey, you guys!
The train's right over there.
Come on. Hurry up. Let's go!
Let's move.
Hey, man, don't worry about it.
Stay loose.
Fuck.
Rembrandt, mark this spot.
Hey! Wait for me!
Riffs!
Yeah, right!
Who are the Warriors?
There must be some word.
I want them all.
I want all the Warriors!
I want them alive, if possible.
If not, wasted.
But I want them.
Send the word.
All right, now, for all you boppers out there in the big city, all you street people with an ear for the action,
I've been asked to relay a request from the Gramercy Riffs.
It's a special for the Warriors.
That's that real, live bunch from Coney.
And I do mean the Warriors.
Here's a hit with them in mind.
Be looking good, Warriors.
All the way back to Coney.
You hear me, babies?
Good. Real good.
Adiós. 
- Come on. What kind of crap is this?
- Yeah. What are we waiting for?
A train would help, unless you wanna go up there and get japed on an open platform.
Bullshit, man.
There ain't nobody on the street.
He's right. We're acting like faggots.
Just keep talking.
Move.
That's the Turnbull A.C.'s.
I think they forgot about the truce.
No shit.
Those lousy skinheaded fucks.
That's our train. We gotta make it.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Are we gonna go for it?
Hold the fucking train!
Those guys were some desperate dudes.
- So was we!
- Even fight. We could take them.
Bunch of chickenshits!
Those cats didn't look too chicken shit to me.
Me neither.
Well, we made it. And in an hour, it is C.I., the Big Coney.
You got it. Give me that fist, buddy.
When we get there, that's when we've made it.
Hey, no sweat, war chief.
- Hey! I've got Coney Island!
- Yeah!
Figure out how many stops to the Union Square?
Hey, come on, man.
That's high math for Rembrandt.
It's all right. Nobody can read these maps anyway.
Hey, forget it. What's the difference?
We're home free.
We just heard from the Turnbulls.
They blew it.
Shit. This train's had it.
This is fucking impossible.
What the shit are we gonna do?
This sucks.
Why couldn't it rain now?
Maybe we ought to worry about who set that goddamn fire.
Come on.
Yeah.
How are you?
I was just checking in.
Yeah, it was a real mess up there.
This guy, Cyrus, had an accident.
They did?
Well, that's okay.
These guys, the Warriors...
Yeah, they deserve it.
Yeah, we will.
Take care of yourself.
- We set?
- We're set, all right.
Somebody should pick their ass up.
The Riffs sent out the word.
They want them alive.
We don't.
The sooner someone grabs them, the better.
You afraid the Warriors will shoot their mouths off before they get racked?
Yeah. Right. I'm worried.
- I just don't want the Riffs on my ass.
- No sweat.
They're looking for the Warriors, remember?
We can do some looking too.
Ought to make you feel better.
Hey.
- What about the money you owe?
- For what?!
We've had it.
Yeah, I made them.
Two there, one there.
I think they just made us.
You recognize them?
Orphans.
So far down, they ain't even on the map.
Real low-class.
- Numbers?
- Full strength, maybe 30.
Thirty's a lot more than eight.
Not if they're wimps.
And I'm sick of this running crap.
Come on. This way.
Hey.
- You know where that cat's headed.
- Yeah. Reinforcements.
We're gonna get japed here.
We're gonna get japed.
No matter what he says, nobody lip-off.
Nobody get hot.
I'm gonna see what I can do.
- When did you turn into a diplomat?
- Yeah.
You ain't exactly the State Department type.
Fox, you come with me.
- You ought to show me your invitation.
- How do you figure?
Well, you come armying down here, invading our territory.
No permits, no parley.
We're not invading.
And I'm parleying right now.
We were just at that big meeting up in the Bronx.
We're going home to Coney.
The train gets messed up by the fire and dumps us here.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.
How could this be a big meeting if the Orphans wasn't there?
You didn't miss anything. There was a lot of hassle. A lot of heads got busted.
You think the Orphans ain't with it?
You think we ain't well-known?
- We didn't say that.
- Well, we got a heavy rep.
You mess with us, and you'll find that out.
You see that?
They write about our raids in the paper.
Yeah.
That's really heavy.
The Orphans, right?
Yeah, our youth worker, she talks about you guys all the time.
We ain't got one.
That must be because you guys are so bad, they're afraid of you.
You can make it through our territory, as long as you're coming in peace.
Cut it, Mercy.
You know what that is, don't you?
Yeah.
Trouble.
Those vests are real nice.
Lighten up, Mercy.
Stop looking for trouble now.
- I should've slapped your mouth
- So who stopped you?
Come on. Give me one.
Just one.
I just want one vest.
You can get another one, man.
No chance.
Are you just gonna let an army walk through here any time they feel like it?
- How's it gonna look?
- Get lost.
You know, pretty soon, every gang is just gonna boogie right in, soldier right through.
I'll tell you, some man you are.
Take your colors off, you can walk through.
- We don't do that.
- It's just our mark. It don't mean war.
You go as civilians, okay? Go as soldiers, I gotta come down on you.
Now take off your colors.
You hear me?
Fuck you.
We're not gonna hide who we are just because some whore shakes her ass.
Don't call me no whore.
I ain't no whore!
Let's go.
We're marching to the next station through these lame fucks's territory.
Now let's move.
Yeah. That's right, Warriors.
Just keep walking.
Real tough mothers, ain't you?
You guys don't show me much.
Why don't you dickheads just walk all the way back home!
- Boy, that chick's got some mouth.
- You two were terrific back there.
- You guys let them down, but good.
- His ass gonna be ringing for a month.
- I say we should have wasted them.
- Come on. The station's this way.
Let me go! Let me be.
Okay, what do you got in mind?
Well, maybe I'm looking for some real action.
Hey, what about me?
I got the big one.
I'll give it to you, baby.
Let her go.
You gonna jump me?
Maybe we ought to pull a train on you.
You look like you might even like it.
- Fuck you!
- Real tough chick.
You see what you get, Warriors?!
You see what you get when you mess with the Orphans?!
We're gonna rain on you, Warriors!
- Holy shit!
- Now!
- Move, move!
- Where is everybody?
Come on!
Hey, wait a minute.
I gotta ask a question.
How come we're running?
I told you, they're a bunch of wimps.
Union Station, here we come.
Hey, what about me?
So, what about you?
We got a report from the Bronx.
Some smalltime clique ran into them.
The Orphans.
- They're not in our network.
- They rumble anyway.
They got wasted.
Okay, let's get down to it, boppers.
We're gonna have to do better out there.
Our friends just made it past one of the minor league teams.
Remember, boppers, be looking good.
All that's going on?
Right. Great.
Great.
Yeah.
Well?
Some two-bit outfit almost got them, but bopped their way past.
- We can meet them at 96th Street.
- The platform's crawling with cops.
Cops are trying to rack up every gang in this town.
- Me and you included.
- How come you're so happy?
I'm having a good time.
Let's go!
How much longer we gotta wait?
We might be here forever.
I'm sick of waiting for trains.
Vermin, sit down and shut up.
Okay, okay.
- Let's go!
- Where are we going?
Hey, hold it!
- Right there.
- Come on.
- Hold it.
- Hey.
Take the uptown.
- Make it! Make it!
- Move!
- Hey! Move! Move!
- Wait up!
- Come back here!
- Hold it!
Let's double back!
- This way!
- No. Come on. Over here.
That way! Go!
- Down the stairs!
- Hurry up.
- The street!
- Far enough, already.
This way.
Oh, shit!
Run!
Just get out of here!
Move!
- Goddamn you!
- Let go of me!
Where are they?
- Union Square! Union Square!
- What about the others?
We gotta go!
Keep after them! Keep on!
Maybe we'd better take off.
Yeah. Right.
- Did we lose these fucking clowns?
- Look.
Holy shit!
Snow, with me!
Hey!
I can't make it.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
Good. I'm sick of running from these wimps.
I'm gonna shove that bat up your ass and turn you into a Popsicle.
Come on.
- Fucking-A.
- Hey!
Come on, cowboy.
Shit, I figured they were wimps.
The latest sports news off the street, boppers.
The Baseball Furies dropped the ball, made an error.
Our friends are on second base and trying to make it all the way home.
But the inside word is that the odds are against them.
Stay tuned, boppers.
Stay tuned.
- Where is everybody?
- Looks like we're the first ones here.
We're just gonna have to sit and wait.
They'll show up.
Looks like something else showed up.
Well, hey, hey, hey.
Now look at what you find here in the big city.
- Man, you guys. We ain't got time.
- You kidding?
Time's what we got plenty of.
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
I guess she don't know that parks ain't safe after dark.
- We ain't got time for this right now.
- We've got to get to Union Square.
You go ahead if you want.
I'm gonna get a little exercise.
You never were very smart.
I'll tell you something, warlord.
I'm smart enough.
And it's there for free.
You two coming?
- Come on, man.
- There's plenty of women back home.
Maybe all of you just going faggot.
You feeling all right, lady?
You need a little help or something?
Why don't you sit down.
Keep me company.
Whatever you say, lady.
Look at those muscles.
I bet the chicks like all those muscles.
Hey.
We better go back and look out for him.
He saved my ass back there.
I owe him.
Okay, I'll go look for the others.
You wanna show me how you play with the chicks?
Yeah.
- I'll show you how I play.
- Hey!
Not so rough. Come on.
- We'll get it on.
- You don't get it. I like it rough.
Your nights in the park are over for a while, honey.
- You're under arrest.
- Hey, lady...
Come on, lady.
Kiss my ass.
Come on, lady.
Come on. Quit playing around.
You don't wanna play around with me!
Let me out of this thing!
You hear me?!
Goddamn it! Let me go!
Let me go!
You can't do this to me!
Come on, you lousy bitch!
Fucking wimp.
Hey, wait!
Still cops all over the place.
Where's the Fox?
A cop grabbed him.
So how come you hung around?
I don't know.
- Where did you get the coat?
- You ask a lot of questions.
Don't give me that.
I stole it.
Cops are looking for somebody in a pink top.
Real tough chick.
Right. You said that before.
If you still wanna get to Union Square,
I can show you where to grab the train.
Okay.
Come on.
Hey.
Hey!
- What is that?
- Hold it!
- Freeze!
- Go on.
Move it!
- Jesus!
- Come on!
Run!
Is this the place?
Hey, I hate asking the questions, but where's the dudes?
Chicks like you always got dudes around.
They took the night off.
Went up to the Bronx.
Don't worry about them.
They're lame, real cripples.
Come on.
When I got off that subway and I saw you, I thought:
"Oh, baby, throw it my way. "
I mean, it's really great of you chicks taking us in.
We know about the Warriors.
They're a heavy outfit. We know you.
- How'd you hear about us?
- You know how. Word gets around.
- I guess we are pretty well-known.
- Come on.
You're the first friendly faces we've seen all night.
That's the way we are.
Let's party a little.
Get something going.
- Yeah, sure. Hey, I can dig that.
- Hey, you came to the right guys.
Oh, hurt me, hurt me.
Don't thank us, man. Just relax.
Fall out.
Take your pick.
Thanks. This is a great outfit.
- What clique is this?
- We're the Lizzies.
Lizzies. Hey, great.
Just great. I like that. I like it.
Glad to hear it.
Man, we got to come to this part of town more often.
Yeah, right.
That's right. Got to.
Thanks a lot.
- Looks like you're the winner.
- Yeah, right.
How much longer are we gonna hang around here?
- What's your hurry? We just got here.
- We ought to get to Union Square.
- They're gonna be worried about us.
- Yeah, sure. In a minute.
Quit breaking the action.
Can we stop for a minute? I'm sick of this crap. My legs are getting tired.
- Come on. Just keep walking.
- Well, what's your hurry?
Trying to set some kind of a world record or something?
Hey.
- Just walk.
- I'm walking.
Jesus, why don't you give me a break.
Be a little friendly.
I don't even know your name.
My name's Swan.
What do you care about names so much for?
I like telling my friends
I been with somebody particular.
You know what I mean?
Why don't you just tie a mattress to your back.
You don't care where it is, do you?
Look, what do you got against me?
You been picking on me all night.
You want me to tell you the truth?
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
I don't like the way you live.
- The way I live?
- Yeah.
I keep hoping I'm gonna run into something a little better.
What kind of crap is this?
Who are you?
You ain't any better than me.
I guess you like the way everything's going for you.
Well, maybe I do.
Friday nights are pretty good.
Saturday nights are better.
I don't think you can remember who you get on Friday and Saturday.
I don't think you can remember what they look like.
Sometimes I can, and sometimes
I can't. Who gives a damn?
I see what's happening next door and down the block, belly hanging down, five kids, cockroaches in the cupboard.
I'll tell you what I want.
I want something now.
This is the life I got left.
You know what I mean?
You get it, Warrior?
Get it?
How do you like it?
Come on. What's wrong?
Let's just get to the next station, okay?
No.
Please?
Come on.
Come on.
You're just part of everything that's happening tonight, and it's all bad.
Just go back to wherever it was you came from.
Hey, little man, you wanna dance?
I'll be right with you, babe.
So you're the famous Warriors, the guys that shot Cyrus.
Shit! The chicks are packed.
The chicks are packed!
Shit!
Shit.
She cut me. She cut me.
Look. Look, man.
Now we gotta hold ourselves together.
We got to.
See, man, now if we go to pieces, somebody out there's gonna get us.
They think we shot Cyrus.
- What are you talking about?
- They think we shot Cyrus.
Every gang in this city must be looking for us.
Holy shit!
We're not gonna be able to make it back.
We're gonna make it back.
We came this far.
We'll go the rest of the way.
Let's go to Union Square, okay?
We gotta tell the rest of the guys.
Hey.
Where's the rest of them?
Yeah, right.
Where's everybody else?
Cops got Ajax.
We don't know about Swan.
- Oh, Jesus!
- Are you sure about Ajax?
Real sure.
I bet he went out swinging.
We better go look for Swan.
God, I can't believe it.
Yeah. What is this shit?
I need to talk to you.
See that dude over there with the skates?
Over there.
He's after you.
And he's got some guys with him.
I know they're on my ass.
But now they know I know it.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Come on.
You sure change your mind fast.
- I was kind of rough on you there.
- Listen, I can take care of myself.
Sure. Come on.
Wait a minute. I can't go in there.
It's a men's room.
Are you kidding?
Get him!
What about our patrols?
So far, nothing.
But we've got somebody here you ought to talk to.
He says he saw who shot Cyrus.
Big Cyrus, he was gonna run the whole city.
What crap that was.
Cyrus was right about one thing.
It's all out there.
All we gotta do is just figure out a way to go steal it.
Sounds great.
All you gotta do is figure out what's worth stealing.
Okay, come on. Let's go.
Come on, let me get some breakfast or something.
- Let's get off here.
- Yeah.
What's this for?
I just hate seeing anything go to waste.
This is what we fought all night to get back to?
Maybe I'll just take off.
Well, you know I like traveling too.
Where have you ever been?
I never been anywhere.
I just know I'd like it.
Come on. Let's go.
Stay right on their ass.
Wait a couple seconds after we move, then cut out the other way.
- Why can't I stay with you?
- Just do what I tell you.
- Okay?
- Come on.
I can take care of myself.
I proved that.
Come on.
Warriors.
Come out to play!
Warriors.
Come out to play!
Warriors.
Come out to play.
Warriors.
Come out to play.
Warriors.
Come out to play!
Everybody packed?
Yeah.
All of you stay behind me.
I'm gonna take them out to the sand.
What about you? You ready?
Let's do it.
When we see the ocean, we figure we're home, we're safe.
This time, you got it wrong.
Why did you do it?
Why did you waste Cyrus?
No reason.
I just like doing things like that.
Let's do it, me and you.
One on one?
You're crazy.
You're dead, all of you, and you know it.
- You're dead.
- Swan!
- Riffs!
- Yeah, right!
You still looking for us?
We found what we're looking for.
No.
No.
It wasn't us.
It was them, the Warriors.
You Warriors are good.
Real good.
The best.
The rest is ours.
No!
Good news, boppers.
The big alert has been called off.
It turns out that the early reports were wrong, all wrong.
Now for that group out there that had such a hard time getting home, sorry about that.
I guess the only thing we can do is play you a song.
Ripped by:
SkyFury
Wake up
Logan, you are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me.
Logan 6.
It's not every day they authorize a new Sandman.
I'll tell you, Francis, that's him.
Maybe, maybe not.
What does it matter?
He isn't yours anymore.
All right, you want me to wake him?
Break-in.
Now you've done it.
Scanners report intrusion. Identify.
Logan 5, Francis 7, authorized duty quadrant.
Intrusion accidental.
Clear, Logan 5. Clear, Francis 7.
All right, Francis, I'm with you.
Only the crazies hang around nursery.
There'll be a couple of new Sandmen tomorrow.
How do you know?
Some of our guys are on Carrousel tonight.
And Sandmen always renew. I know.
But you don't know. You just assume.
One for one. What everyone's been taught. One for one.
Why not? That's how everything works.
Keeps everything in balance.
One is terminated, one is born.
Simple, logical, perfect.
- You have a better system?
- Of course not.
At least I wonder about it sometimes.
Not like you with your automatic routine.
You sound like a sleep teacher with a stuck tape.
Leave it alone, it's perfect.
You know, Logan, you wonder a lot.
Too much for a Sandman.
Why were you so angry just then?
What did he do to you?
That red's going to run. I can always tell.
Did you ever see Francis 8?
I never even visited nursery before tonight.
You know, when you question, it slows you down.
I don't know. What makes you so curious?
You know who his seed-mother was?
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick.
Good.
Look at the crowd.
Good Carrousel tonight.
Last Day, Capricorn 15s.
Year of the city, 2274.
Carrousel begins.
Last Day, Capricorn 15s.
Year of the city, 2274.
Carrousel begins.
Would you mind?
Thanks a lot.
A few over there could have been his seed-mother.
Only a few?
You're just not trying.
Capricorn 15s...
...born 2244...
...enter the Carrousel.
This is the time of renewal.
Be strong...
...and you will be renewed.
Identify.
Rise.
Renew! Renew!
Come on!
Higher!
Renew! Renew!
Renew!
Renew!
Renew!
Affirmative!
Renew!
Run, runner!
Did you hear him? Run!
- Hold it!
- Runner!
Runner terminated, 0.31.
Ready for cleanup.
Request identity check.
Affirmative.
He was good, wasn't he?
Showed he had some life in him in the end.
That was a great shot you made.
You kept missing him.
I had to do something.
It's crazy. He could have renewed on Carrousel.
Now he's finished forever.
Why do they run?
Hello.
Welcome.
Please, no.
Please?
No?
Come on.
What's wrong?
You prefer women?
Well?
Nothing, I felt sad.
I put myself on the circuit.
It was a mistake.
Sad?
Why do you feel sad?
A friend of mine went on Carrousel.
Now he's gone.
Yes, well...
...I'm sure he was renewed.
He was killed.
Like the others.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Isn't that what you do? Kill?
I've never killed anyone in my life.
Sandmen terminate runners.
What's your name?
Jessica.
That's sad enough.
You're beautiful.
Let's have sex.
Then why are you wasting my time?
Why'd you put yourself on the circuit?
I thought I had to do something.
I told you it was a mistake...
...and I've changed my mind.
Because I'm a Sandman?
Am I your first?
Yes.
And I'm curious.
About what?
How a Sandman lives.
It's a little different from most people...
...but I assure you we have the same feelings as everybody else.
If you're feeling curious it's-
Not about that.
What, then?
Why is it wrong to run?
You shouldn't think such things...
...let alone talk about them.
Look, you know what to do.
You try like hell for renewal.
Otherwise, when this turns to black, that's it.
But if for some strange reason you want to be 31...
...then you have the same chance as everyone.
Like your friend.
Carrousel.
But...
...if you're one of the misfits...
...that's where I come in.
I didn't say that I would run.
I just...
How old are you?
I'm a 6.
I go red next year.
You're years away.
What quad do you live in?
IK.
You're quite sure you don't want to...?
It's nice to know you can nod.
It's nice to know you can do that too.
I've been looking all over for you.
We're having a party, right?
Hey, Francis.
They're great.
Let's fade out.
Give me my screamer back.
They're mine now.
What happened?
- I lost a runner in Cathedral.
- How come?
Ran into some cubs.
One of them cut me all the way down.
Cubs.
I'm off to New You for repairs.
Get yourself a new face while you're at it. They know you now.
I might look in on the
New You myself. Number 483.
- You? Why?
- It's that last runner.
He got a face change on Last Day.
If so, someone in 483 was trying to help him.
Check it out.
Got a runner in power center.
What's with you?
Last night.
You had a kicker.
She must have got him in the head.
Identify.
Clear, Francis 7.
There goes another one.
Why do they run instead of going on Carrousel?
Good one.
Runner terminated, power center.
7106, identification correct.
- See you in the hydro toner.
- Be right with you.
Logan 5...
...approach and identify.
Sit facing the screen, Logan 5.
Identify.
Do you identify this object?
Negative.
Question: What is it?
That is the name of the object. Ankh.
Do you identify this word...
"... Sanctuary"?
Negative.
Sanctuary is a pre
- catastrophe code word...
...used for a place of immunity.
I don't understand.
The object ankh...
...has been identified with the code word "Sanctuary. "
The object and the word both relate...
...to runners who have not been accounted for.
- Question-
- Hold.
Unaccounted runners: 1056.
You may state your question.
1056 unaccounted for?
The number is correct.
That's impossible.
Question: Maybe they weren't all runners.
Maybe most of them reached life renewal on Carrousel.
Question:
Nobody reached renewal?
But everybody believes that some-
The question was answered.
You mean, nobody's ever been renewed?
The question has been answered.
You are authorized to penetrate city seals...
...and search outside the dome.
The seals?
Question: What seals?
Outside?
There's nothing outside.
You will find Sanctuary and destroy.
Question:
What if I need help from another Sandman?
Negative. You will begin assignment by becoming...
...a runner seeking Sanctuary.
Question:
I'm only red six now.
How can I pretend that
I'm approaching Last Day?
Identify.
My life clock.
Question: My life clock?
Retrogram complete.
Procedure 033-03.
But am I still red 6?
I had four more years.
I will get them back, won't I?
You will take the object ankh with you for identification.
Question:
Do I get my four years back?
What the hell took you so long?
It was...
...the debriefing.
It was more complicated than usual.
Come on, get in the water.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
You've been skulling out too much.
First nursery, and now silly questions.
But did you?
Did I what?
See anybody renewed?
Of course.
Anybody we know?
Look...
...get into the water.
You need it more than I do.
Francis, I have to talk to you.
I'll see you.
Here I am.
Now tell me why.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
I'm the most beautiful woman you ever saw, I suppose.
Maybe.
- And you must have me?
- Yes. Something like that.
- Just like that?
- Yes, why not?
But I still have the choice?
Of course.
Then the answer's still no.
No, I don't believe you.
- That's why you had me brought here?
- Would you have come on your own?
Well, there it is. I was right.
You can have any woman in the city.
What do you really want?
Why show me?
Because I'm going to run.
Why tell me?
You know something.
About running? Dying, what?
Both. But running is what I'm interested in.
I know what everyone knows.
Try like hell for renewal. You have the same chance as anyone else. Carrousel.
Look, don't you understand? It's different now because it's me!
My life.
Help me.
How can I?
Where'd you get that?
I got it from a runner.
And then you killed him.
It was my job.
But now...
...it's different.
Believe me.
I don't.
Speak to your friends for me.
What friends?
Look, I don't have much time!
I never heard of a
Sandman running, ever.
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
First level, near the hand.
Don't look for us, we'll see you.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.
Can you do it?
Will you?
Tonight?
Yes.
I'm sorry, Jessica.
We all are.
But he has heard about Sanctuary.
And that makes him dangerous to all of us.
Doesn't it?
Oh, thanks, Francis. I can use a break.
Just don't take forever, like last time.
You love it. You're afraid you'll miss a really good run.
You spoke to them?
Them?
Why are you here?
I'm here to help you.
Come with me to Arcade.
Wait, Logan.
We have to talk.
Yes, we have to.
What is it?
A runner. In Cathedral.
A woman. Come on.
You better go home.
I'd rather be with you.
Logan's got a mean one tonight.
- Cathedral. I better help him.
- Watch out.
Careful, they'll cut you to pieces before you see them.
Are the cubs really as wild as they say?
Never been there, have you?
No, of course not.
You wanted to come with me. You'll find out.
They're wild, all right.
They're the violent ones. There's no place else for them, unless they change.
People say it's because they're born in breeders.
Had you heard that?
We're all born in breeders.
But most of us don't end up running wild in Cathedral.
No, but they say human mothering might be better.
I wish I'd known my mother.
Where do you get these crazy ideas?
When did you begin to question Last Day?
I didn't say I questioned it.
Do you?
Entering a reservation for violent delinquents.
Authorized persons only.
I've never been in this quadrant before.
Request door open, Cathedral Plaza.
Logan 5 authorized to enter risk area.
They shut it to keep in the cubs.
Let me go first.
Sometimes they're waiting just inside there.
Quick, before it closes.
Don't be afraid.
What's your name?
Mary 2.
Where do you live?
Here.
Why aren't you in nursery?
I'm very smart.
When are you green?
When do you go up?
I never go upstairs.
You're a nice old lady.
No, don't.
Might be a decoy.
Runner!
Watch out!
Circle! Circle!
Get behind them.
Don't let them get away.
Billy, come on!
Billy, we've got one!
We've got a runner and his pair-up.
And look who decided to run.
I cut up a Sandman yesterday.
They said I'd never get him, but I cut him up good.
I feel sorry for you, boy.
For me?
You better feel sorry for yourself.
I feel sorry for you, Billy.
How old are you?
Your time is running out here.
How long have you got left here?
A year, six months? What happens when you're 16 and you go to green?
Nothing will happen. Nothing!
I make the rules here.
No cubs over 15, Billy!
Look, have you ever seen a cub who's turned to green?
You'll have to leave then...
...because they won't let you stay here.
And if you do try and stay here...
...your young friends here will rip your guts apart!
Muscle!
All right, children, playtime's over.
How many of you want this to be Last Day?
Come on, we can rush him!
Come on, we can take him again!
Come on! Cut me!
Runner?
There's been a terrible error.
My life clock must have broken in some way.
I'm nowhere near 30.
I'm 22.
I should be green.
Did you hear me? Green!
- Now, don't be afraid!
- Let me go! Let me go!
I am not going to hurt you.
Now, look.
There.
There. See?
We want to help you.
Sanctuary?
This means nothing to you?
Listen...
...if they find you, throw this hard enough to break it.
But remember, don't breathe until you get away.
It's blind gas.
Runner?
Runner terminated at 0. 16.
Ready for clean up,
Cathedral quadrant 39.
I must tell you now. When we were in
Arcade, I was taking you to be killed.
I'm sorry, I didn't believe you.
But you do now?
Of course.
You let the runner go.
Then tell me where Sanctuary is.
Take me to your friends.
I can't tell you.
And if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
But you saw me let her go. Tell them.
They won't listen. You're a Sandman.
They won't take the chance.
Request maze car, Cathedral Plaza.
Stand by to open door.
It's open.
Come on, we got to go.
Where will you go now?
Back to Arcade.
I'm going to get a new face.
But you can't, you're a runner.
No one will do it.
There's New You 483.
I think there's someone there can help me.
Maybe there is.
The cheeks could be narrowed, the mouth changed...
Please let me know as soon as you've made your selection.
I'll let you know as soon as she's decided.
Hello, Sandman.
We don't get many Sandmen.
I think we've had only one since I've been here.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else.
Doc, there's a Sandman here. Can you see him?
Doc is ready, Sandman.
I recommend a more detailed study of our projections.
There are new suggestions for your consideration...
- This is a real privilege, Sandman.
- For me too.
I thought you'd be older.
I mean, I was expecting a red.
I am.
Your own work?
Yes, I did it myself.
Right on there.
I'll show you.
This is the Aesculaptor Mark 3.
The latest. It's completely self-contained.
It has a tilt bed and cryojectors in the platform.
Well, Sandman, what will it be?
Face job? Full-body job?
Just the face.
Fine, Holly'll get you ready.
You're in expert hands.
Believe me.
Will you get on the table, please?
Want me to take my clothes off?
Not for your face.
You shouldn't have brought him here.
I didn't bring him.
What's the difference?
He's blinking.
He wants to run.
Run?
He's a Sandman.
I tell you, he's running. I know.
Maybe.
I just wish he'd gone somewhere else.
All right, he gets a face.
I like dark hair.
Tell him to give you dark hair.
All set?
Did you have anything special in mind?
I don't care, just-
Dark hair.
Oh, yes.
Holly would like dark hair.
We'll start by narrowing the cheekbones.
With this, there's no waiting for scar burnishing.
It's all in one.
Watch now.
Here's the improvement.
Instant healing before you feel a thing.
Hello, yes?
Yes, they are.
Done.
Pay attention, Sandman.
I'm proud of this machine.
Perfect depth adjustment on this one.
The beam will cut through that uniform and just through the skin beneath.
Absolute precision.
Watch now.
Just imagine what would happen...
...if the healing stopped functioning.
Doc, the machine is spinning!
Right! It's a trap.
They know.
I'm a runner!
- What's going on?
- Get out of my way! Get off me!
What are you talking about?
I saw you let a runner go.
In Cathedral.
I was there!
Follow me.
Stay close.
We've got to go through the Love Shop.
Where'd they go?
A Sandman and a green?
Didn't you see them?
- Why do you run from your friend?
- Because he is my friend.
I don't want to be killed by him, or anyone else.
He's good, isn't he?
You mean, will he find us and kill us? Yes. Or one of the others will.
You know, they won't believe us.
Maybe not. But I'd rather take my chance with them than with Francis.
They won't listen.
Do you think Sandmen will?
There's no other way for me.
We'll convince them.
You better stay behind me.
How will they know we're coming?
They're watching us now.
They'll let us in when they're sure.
There, 17th Quadrant IK.
- Whose signal?
- Logan 5.
- Who's available?
-7, 9 and Arcade Patrol.
Sandman, put your hands on your head.
Clasp your fingers together.
Now turn your hands over. Palms up.
In a moment, a light will shine in your eyes.
Walk into it. Jessica first. Then you, Sandman.
You will have to stoop, but don't unclasp your hands.
Do you agree?
Move against the pillar.
Up against it!
Look, I'm a runner.
She brought me here because
I begged her to help me.
- He's lying.
- No Sandman ever ran.
You don't run.
You kill runners.
You have always killed runners.
Yes, I have.
But now it's my turn.
And I find I want to live.
What's the matter with you?
He's a runner! He's blinking!
We must help anyone who asks. We must!
Or we're the same as they are, deciding who lives or dies!
Holly. Holly New You 483.
He's dead. Doc is dead.
And the Sandman came.
It's him!
He killed Doc.
Wait!
He's running.
Tell them the rest!
He's the one.
And you, too. I remember.
He was in a hurry.
A face job only.
And I said, dark hair.
And then he killed Doc...
...and you grabbed me and the machine blew up and I ran.
I ran.
Holly, please!
The other Sandman.
Remember?
The one who came after?
That's right.
The other one came after.
And he was hunting the first one, wasn't he?
Wasn't he?
This one was running...
...and the other one was hunting him, remember?
He was after you.
I remember.
You were running.
I say we pass them through.
Runner...
...follow the corridor with the pipes overhead.
The way is always down.
Then this isn't Sanctuary?
No, you must follow the tunnel...
...to the end.
Where do I go from there?
When you come to the lock, there will be a message.
After that, there's no turning back.
No. Jessica goes back now.
Do you hear me?
You must go back now.
No, I'm going with you.
No, it's not possible.
No, you must go back.
Somebody take her back.
See that she gets out of here.
Please...
...it's dangerous.
I don't care.
I want to go to Sanctuary.
Take me with you?
Jessica, why?
You're still a green.
You're not running.
It doesn't matter what I am.
I want to be with you.
Listen to me!
I'm your friend. I understand.
We all go crazy once in a while.
Nobody knows except me. I won't tell.
I could have turned you in. I didn't.
But she's a runner.
And it's over.
Terminate her! Now!
You're a Sandman! Now, Logan. Now!
Stay out of it!
What do we do now?
Runner, this is the last gate.
Use your key now.
When the bell sounds again, use your key.
Good luck, runner.
May you find Sanctuary.
I still have the key
I took from the runner.
There.
We must be somewhere under the city.
I'd always heard the city received its power from the sea...
...but this looks forgotten.
Unused.
Runner, this is the last gate.
Use your key now.
When the bell sounds...
What do you suppose this was?
Looks like some sort of breeding pen.
They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything.
To eat, you know?
Must have been a savage world.
He said go down.
Maybe we can put these around us.
Let's take our clothes off first, before they freeze on us.
Welcome, humans.
I am ready for you.
Fish, plankton...
...sea greens and protein from the sea.
Fresh as harvest day.
Overwhelming, am I not?
Are you, too, startled?
Am I too removed from your ken?
What...?
Who are you?
I'm more than machine...
...or man.
More than a fusion of the two.
Don't you agree?
Wait for the winds.
Then, my birds...
...sing...
...and the deep grottoes whisper my name.
Box!
Box!
Box!
This place is a link to Sanctuary, isn't it?
Link?
How do you think we got here?
Same as the others.
Don't you remember?
Why do you think we're here?
Why?
Why?
We were sent here. And you know it.
You say others have been sent here. Where are they?
In hiding?
Hiding?
Yes.
Hiding.
You know about Sanctuary.
I know you do.
- Sanctuary?
- You have to help us.
You don't have a choice!
It's not your decision!
So tell us!
Very well.
Follow me.
This way.
How'd they get there?
Regular storage procedure.
The same as the other food.
The other food stopped coming, and they started.
What other food?
Fish and plankton and sea greens...
...and protein from the sea.
It's all here.
Ready.
Fresh as harvest day.
Fish and plankton.
Sea greens and protein from the sea.
And then it stopped coming...
...and they came instead.
So I store them here.
I'm ready...
...and you're ready.
It's my job...
...to freeze you!
Protein...
...plankton, grass from the sea!
My birds!
My birds!
What is it?
I don't know.
Whatever it is...
...it's warm.
We must be outside.
I didn't know any place could be like this.
Everything hurts.
I hate outside!
- I hate it! I hate it!
- Jessica!
It's all right. Come on, it's all right!
We'll be all right. Don't worry.
We'll get there.
Just got to find some water.
It's dark...
...and cold.
And I'm tired.
Come on. We must get out of here.
Sorry.
I can't go any further.
Let's rest in here.
Do you think everything will turn to ice?
I doubt it.
Don't ever let go.
I won't.
It all seemed to make sense...
...until Box.
You think he was telling the truth?
What truth?
Perhaps we're the first people to get through.
Maybe Sanctuary isn't far now.
Another protected place.
Can't be outside.
Who would ever know?
And even if we find it...
...we can't go back now.
No, you're right.
It must be near now.
We'll find it.
Look!
Logan, look!
Water!
Look.
Look at your palm.
The crystal.
It's clear.
What does it mean?
The life clocks have no power outside.
We're free!
You can have...
...any woman in the city.
What do you really want?
You know.
The choice is still mine?
Of course.
This time...
...the answer's yes.
It must be Sanctuary!
Outside?
Exposed?
But it must be.
Whatever it is, there are probably people there.
And food and shelter.
Come on.
What do you suppose happened to the people?
I don't know. They must have left here.
A long time ago.
I wonder what they were like.
That must be one of them.
Then they looked almost like us.
Except...
...I've never seen a face like that before.
That must be...
...the look of being old.
They've all got names and numbers on them.
I wonder what they are?
"Beloved husband. " "Beloved wife. "
I wonder what it means.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm Logan 5.
This is Jessica 6.
I never much cared for my name, even when I could remember it.
We're from the city.
Yes, we came through the ice.
We got past Box.
Box?
This is Sanctuary, isn't it?
Sanctuary?
May I see your hand?
Look at his face.
His hair.
- Is that what it is to grow old?
- I guess so, yes.
But how old are you?
I don't know. I'm as old...
...as I am, I suppose.
Your hair is white.
Yes, well, it wasn't always that color, you know.
I got my color someplace here.
It wasn't your color. It wasn't much like hers, either.
Those cracks in your face...
...do they hurt?
Can I touch them?
Oh, my.
Try.
Are you alone here?
Hardly.
I got all these cats.
Is that what they're called? Cats?
And they've each got their own name.
Cats, of course, what else would they be called?
Cats!
You know they've each got three names?
The naming of cats is a difficult matter.
It's not just one of your holiday games.
You may think at first
I'm mad as a hatter...
...when I tell you that each cat's got three different names.
See, they got their ordinary name...
...and then they got their fancy name.
And that makes two names, doesn't it?
Now it's got a third name.
Can either of you two guess what that third name is?
Come on!
Above and beyond...
...there's one name that's left over...
...and this is the name you never will guess.
The name no human research can discover...
...but the cat itself knows...
...and never will confess.
Will you, Henry?
How long have you been living here?
A little longer than I can remember.
What kind of a place is this?
Well, it's...
...just a place, you know. Just a place.
How'd you get here?
I've always been here. Hello, Thomas.
Are there other people?
Oh, gracious, no.
Has anyone else ever passed through here?
There may be a few out there. I don't know.
What makes you think that?
My parents told me.
My mother...
...and my father.
You knew your mother and father?
Sure, they raised me.
How were you grown?
Inside your mother?
Right in there.
Are you sure?
That's what she told me.
I have to believe her. I don't know.
Where are they?
What was that?
Where are they now?
Where?
They're dead.
They are dead. Yeah.
Buried.
Buried?
They're buried.
Gus was the cat at the theater door.
His name, and I should have told you before, is really Asparagus.
But that's such a fuss to pronounce.
...we call him just Gus.
Why did you want to see my hand before?
You'd better show me yours.
Yes, you had.
That's lovely.
That's beautiful.
Can I have one of these?
I'm sorry. It's not possible.
That's just not fair.
Hello.
I'll give you one of my best cats, my favorite.
I'll give you a Jellicle cat. I will.
I'm sorry, I really don't have anything to give you.
That's the truth.
You hear that?
Here, you can have this.
What is that treasure?
I don't know.
You don't know. You're full of secrets as Macavity.
Macavity, Macavity. There's no one like Macavity.
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.
What lies beyond this place? Do you know?
Welleverity.
I don't know, nothing. Nothing there.
Did your father or mother ever mention another place?
My mother? No, she never mentioned any other.
Nothing at all.
May we stay here?
We'd like to rest awhile.
Of course. This belongs to the people.
- What belongs to the people?
- Certainly does. All of it.
What people?
All of them. It's marked on the wall someplace.
All the people, all the time...
...shall not...
I'll be right back.
That sweet madman.
How could he come to exist?
He had a mother and a father.
And they spent their lives together.
One in a million, I suppose.
Who knows?
We are going on, aren't we?
There's nothing to go on to.
There's Sanctuary.
There is.
You want there to be one, but-
There has to be!
I know it exists.
- It has to.
- No, it does not. Not really.
Just so many people want it to exist, so many people who don't want to die...
...they want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes real.
But it doesn't exist. It never existed.
Just the hope.
You're wrong!
- It has to be! It has to be!
- Oh, Jessica.
Oh, my.
Don't cry.
Look, I got some bigger ones of these over there. I don't know who they all are.
I think they must be family.
That'll cheer you up.
That's my color. That's what it is.
Leave her alone.
Surprised you, Doris, didn't he?
Now, I don't know who these all are.
I'm quite used to them. They all look the same to me now.
When I first found them, they were a little different.
You know, feel free to look at them.
But they're all old men.
Father said that one of these people...
...never told a lie. I don't know which one it is.
You thought I wouldn't find you, didn't you?
You thought I'd quit, huh?
What did you do to him?
You know what he was? He was a Sandman.
He was happy.
You ruined him. You killed him.
Wait.
I've seen this face before.
Yes, isn't he the...
Logan!
Why, Logan?
Why?
Is this good? Is this what you want?
We had good times.
I let you go.
You wouldn't terminate a runner...
...and I covered for you!
Why did you let her?
And now, I have to finish you.
You are terminated, runner.
Francis, look at your palm.
Go on. Look at it.
Go on, look at it!
Believe me, it's true.
This isn't the truth.
This is a lie!
Francis, stop! Listen!
That was the right shot.
Watch out, now.
He's tricky.
He'll fool you.
You renewed.
I don't want to say anymore...
...but I hope that is understood, young woman.
Of course.
Now don't forget...
...you promised.
We'll remember.
But that's a long time off.
I wish I knew, but...
Long time off.
What are we promising him?
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
We can't.
We're going back.
Back?
To what?
I have to tell them the truth.
You won't be able to tell anybody anything.
You'll be killed.
Not when they've learned of this.
They won't listen.
Things don't change.
We can stay here together.
Have a life as long as his together.
Jessica, things do change. Look.
You're lying. You don't want to change anything.
You want to go back to kill!
- Listen to me.
- Francis was right!
- You really- -
Look. Listen to me.
The life clocks made me kill Francis.
They kill people every single day.
If I don't go back and try to stop that...
...destroy them...
...I can't live here.
I couldn't live anywhere.
Don't you understand that?
All I want...
...is to be alive and with you.
That's all.
Do you think I want anything different now?
Must we leave soon?
As soon as it gets light.
We're going to have to leave you in the morning.
What kind of people are you?
She promised you'd stay here and bury me! You did!
Come with us.
Yes. Come with us.
Yes, you must.
We need you now.
If people see you, then they must believe us.
Where you going?
We're going to a city with thousands and thousands of people.
Young people.
All the people, all the time.
Five million.
How many...?
Is that more than my cats?
More.
Much, much more.
More than...? Oh, my!
And all of them alive!
Is it a long journey?
It's a journey.
We lived in most of these houses.
But they became too small for us...
...and ran out of mice,
I guess. I don't know.
I used to come fishing here...
...but somehow all the fish died. Long time ago, now.
Nothing sadder than a dead fish.
All young people, you say?
I don't even remember what...
Although, of course, the young people, yeah...
They say this thing used to be called a road.
Had to give bits of metal to use it.
How far away is it?
It's much further than it looks.
It's big.
It's cold. Let's go back to the fire.
- We'll be there soon.
- Soon?
That's worth its weight in gold.
That is, when it's cold.
You know, I've been thinking.
Those words we saw...
..."Beloved husband. " "Beloved wife. "
What do they mean?
Oh, well, you see...
..."Beloved wife" would mean my mother, see?
And "Beloved husband" would be more like...
...my father.
- They use those words to stay together.
- Stay together?
- I can't put it any different.
- But you mean...
I mean, they lived together all their years?
Before I come along, I don't know.
But after, yeah, they did.
So people stayed together for this feeling of love?
They would live and raise children...
...and be remembered?
They raised me, didn't they? Right in there.
I think I'd like that.
Don't you?
Why not?
Beloved husband.
Beloved wife.
Beloved son.
Here we go.
That's right.
You mean to say those people know ahead of time when they'll die?
- That's right.
- That's silly.
What's the reason for that?
That's the way things are.
The way they've always been.
It takes all the fun out of dying.
But if they're all shut up tight in there...
...how we going to get to see them?
All the young people?
What'd you say?
What does the water do?
Must be part of the power system.
The ocean tides are turned into energy somehow.
- Does it go inside the city?
- Yes, I think so.
I don't know where, though.
Just took it for granted, like everything else.
I think it's our only chance.
Here, let me help you!
No, I can look after myself.
If ever a time comes...
...when I can't look after myself, I said to my cats...
"... Why, that's the moment that you... "
Where are you?
I'll have to tell him.
We're going to try and get in through here.
I'm sorry...
...I don't think you can make it.
Oh, my. I was so looking forward to seeing all those people.
I want you to meet them too.
Stay here as long as you can.
We'll bring them to you.
All the people?
You know...
...they've never seen a cat.
People have never seen a cat?
Oh, my.
Don't go in there!
You don't have to die!
No one has to die at 30!
You can live!
Live!
Live and grow old!
I've seen it!
She's seen it!
Look!
Look!
Look, it's clear!
Last Day...
...Capricorn 29s.
Year of the city 2274.
Carrousel begins.
No! Don't!
Don't go!
Listen to him!
He's telling the truth!
We've been outside!
There's another world outside!
We've seen it!
The life clocks are a lie!
Carrousel is a lie!
There is no renewal!
Nobody's going to be renewed!
Believe me!
Please listen!
Logan 5...
...did you find Sanctuary?
Did you find Sanctuary?
We will begin surrogation.
Your surrogates are engaged.
Logan 5...
...you were assigned to find a place called Sanctuary.
Report.
There is no Sanctuary.
Unacceptable. The answer does not program.
You were assigned to locate...
...missing runners.
State what you found.
All frozen.
The input does not program, Logan 5.
You may not resist.
An old...
...man.
You must not resist, Logan 5.
Did you find Sanctuary?
There is no Sanctuary.
An old man.
You broke city seals and went outside.
Confirm outside.
Old ruins...
...exposed.
There is no...
...Sanctuary.
Answer the question.
Input contrary!
Input contrary!
You may not resist!
You may not resist!
Unacceptable!
Unacceptable! Unacceptable!
Watch it!
Advertising and promotional expenditures...
...of $2.845.000...
...were reported.
These expenditures were primarily...
...by "primarily," I mean about
96 percent of these expenditures...
...were for Richter's two main retail brands.
These brands made up over 85 percent...
...of the company profits in the last fiscal year.
An increase of some 14 percent from the previous year.
This increase is based on sales of $ 16.800.000.
Total sales were up only $200.000...
...in the last fiscal year.
Even with an increase in advertising expenditures...
...of $872.000.
So while the sales...
...of Whiz Bam and Cherry Poppie Balls are up...
...sales for their retail brand,
Chocorama...
Yeah, Smith.
Gumball.
Would you repeat that?
Gumball.
Okay, let's wrap it up for today, gentlemen. Thank you.
Gumball!
Will you take a look at this for me?
Here we go.
To him who accepts the challenge.
- Know what he's talking about?
- To him who risks all...
...comes the satisfaction of victory...
...and a sense of physical well-being in return for...
I want you to get this.
In return for hardship...
...exhaustion, discomfort.
Ponos. Thank you very much.
- Hi, Sam.
- Bannon.
It's on. We're go.
Look, I've been giving this matter a lot of thought...
...and look, you don't have anything to lose.
I mean, to you this thing is just a stunt.
I've got a position at this university.
I've got a shot at tenure.
All I have to do is stay out of trouble a couple more years.
I can't risk that.
It's not a risk.
It's a challenge.
Hey, get out of the way!
What's the matter with you? Are you deaf?
I can't eat with all this noise going on.
Come on. Let's take him.
Car 34, come in.
This is car 34, over.
Yeah, we got a telegram for you clowns.
Does "gumball" mean anything to you?
Negative, 10-4.
Let's go.
- Beside the point.
- I've got chicken in the oven.
Hi, Oscar.
The kids' clothes are all laid out.
Okay, don't worry.
Just have a good time.
- I will.
- Bye, Oscar. See you.
- Have a good time.
- Kids, be good. Listen to your daddy.
You'd think she was planning the D-day invasion...
...instead of a weekend in the country.
Attention, please. All passengers...
Excuse me. Thank you.
Hi. Smoking.
Be careful. Be careful.
Andy, you know how often my wife tried to get me to get rid of this car?
Well, that's German machinery for you.
The car outlasted her.
Sedately, Barney...
...as befits our years and station in life.
Of course.
Ace Preston, Mr. Guts himself, is in the white car revving up.
He will attempt the death-defying
Russian T-bone.
There he goes, and where he stops nobody knows.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ace Preston on the high speed.
Go, Ace, go.
Ladies and gentlemen...
- What do you say, buddy?
- I didn't have time to change.
- Aren't you excited about this thing?
- No, I'll be glad when it's over.
Well, I don't expect to live forever.
Don't worry, kid, you won't.
Excuse me, may I give you a flower?
I am a stranger in this country.
And I've never seen such a beautiful woman in all my life.
You see, I would like to know, maybe you could inform me of a...
Here we are, old buddy.
New York, New York. The Big Apple.
I feel ready. I'm pumping up.
I feel pumped up.
Yeah.
Franco.
- Fine, thank you, and you?
- Good.
- How's the bambino?
- She's full of gas. She's wait for you.
Hey, you make a good Italian.
Lieutenant Roscoe?
Mike Pakowsky, N.Y.P.D.
- How are you?
- The car's outside.
I'll take you downtown now.
I got a brother-in-law in L.A.
Two marties and a double Man.
Gumball.
They're coming in now.
All of them.
I'm gonna stay here on the stakeout.
It's 9:05.
I'll check in again at 10.
Graves.
In through that way.
Right through that door there's a banquet room.
Thank you.
- It's just a misunderstanding.
- That's what you call it.
I call it a lie.
- It's after 9:30. That's the deadline.
- Shall we close it up, Mr. Bannon?
Yeah. Put Fred on the door.
I want that room sealed.
Ladies, gentlemen...
...you have been selected because you have the necessary skills.
You are here because you have the determination to succeed.
Now, it won't be as easy as last year.
There are some who will use any means to try and stop us.
Some of you won't make it.
For those of you who do...
...there will be no glory, no headlines.
But...
...just a few magic hours flat-out against the red line...
...with no catalytic converter...
...and no 55-mile-an-hour speed limit.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...the Gumball Rally has begun.
For those of you who've never done this before...
...I think I better go over the rules.
The first thing to remember is that there are no rules.
The first vehicle to reach the parking lot at the Queen Mary in Long Beach...
...is the winner, the unofficial winner.
Because this is an unofficial race.
And so it follows that none of us are really in this race.
We don't want any civilian involvement.
No accidents, please.
Remember, it's 2900 miles.
That, 34 hours and 11 minutes, is the record.
Set last year by our dear friend
Mr. Bannon.
Now I know we all ought to get some rest tonight.
But may I?
I'd like to propose a toast.
To internal combustion...
...and wind in the face.
You know, I think Roscoe's got a grudge against you, Smitty, from last year.
Hey, why do I always get blamed for everything anyway?
Because you're a schemer.
It's gonna be a lot different from last year anyway, you know.
Yeah, I noticed.
- You brought a real ringer with you.
- A what?
Well, you know, your friend Franco.
What do you mean? What's he ever won?
Le Mans, Grand Prix de Monaco, what does that mean?
He's coming along because he's a real nice guy.
It's like trying to kill a butterfly with a hammer.
Oh, stop, will you?
You make me feel ashamed of myself.
Oh, Smitty, don't worry.
Sam and I will do our best.
But isn't it funny, though, sometimes in life when your best...
...just isn't quite good enough, you know?
- You're still bitter?
- No. No, I'm not.
- Oh, yes, you are.
- No. I'm...
I'm gonna win, that's all.
Don't get overconfident.
Let's flip to see who takes care of Roscoe.
Oh, yeah, right.
- Tails.
- Wrong.
- Oh, no. Why do I always get him?
- Take care of him the morning of the race.
Mr. McAllister, Mr. Donahue.
Here you are, sir.
Barney, I'm hungry.
- Sorry, sweetheart.
- Bull's-eye.
Hit the trunk, old buddy.
Lookie here. Extra uniforms.
All of them for along the way.
Look at this. Police decals.
All you gotta do is stick them on the doors.
Hey, give me a hand with the lights.
Give it a try.
Can you imagine?
Do you believe that?
You guys, listen to this.
Look, I been figuring...
...with 200 gallons of gas back here...
...we don't have to make one damn stop, not one.
- Ever seen anything like this?
- No, nice.
Wait till you hear it run, man.
I got that computer information en route.
The weather and the traffic and the road conditions.
What's the matter, Jose?
Nothing, Mr. Bannon. I'm okay.
Hey, don't let all this stuff get you down.
Hey, I'm fine. What do I care?
I mean, if I wanted to go, I could go.
I mean, it's a free country, right?
I mean, this whole race is unofficial, so I'm as unofficial as you are.
See, if I wanted to go, I'd go.
If I had a car.
It's my girlfriend, you see.
She tells me yesterday,
"No more dates on the subway."
I tell you something.
In this country, you ain't nothing...
...if you got no wheels.
Oh, I don't know.
You been on the roads lately?
The age of the motorcar is over.
- Hey, is it okay if I take a few hours off?
- Sure.
Okay, kill it. Kill it.
Hurry up. I'm gonna have to redo everything you've done.
Gee, Mike, what'd you think this was, a vintage-car event?
Well, Smitty, some things get meaner as they get older.
Well, it's real cute. Very fast.
Very uncomfortable.
That's good, though. It's macho.
That's good for you.
That old Smitty. You know, we've been competing in everything:
Sports, school, girls.
Twenty years of competition can sometimes get out of hand.
Why didn't he buy the rest of the Ferrari team?
- I'm not so sure he didn't.
- Hey, where is that Italian flash anyway?
Franco? Hasn't showed up all day.
- He's probably resting up.
- Yeah, getting his plugs cleaned.
I must go now, my darling.
Will you write?
If I can.
I mean, I never met anyone who's gone to Borneo.
It is not a pleasure trip.
Be careful, Franco.
I cannot do the work I must and also be careful.
- Then be lucky.
- That's better.
This is Red Fox to Barracuda.
Red Fox to Barracuda.
Now, I figure they're gonna leave late tonight or early tomorrow morning.
As soon as I see them go,
I'll let you know.
And I want roadblocks on every bridge and tunnel going west. Do you copy?
Now, as the contract reads, no driving after 6 p.m.
Not to exceed 55 miles per hour.
- You're bonded?
- Of course.
Mr. Blakely is a connoisseur of fine automobiles.
But for California driving, he's especially fond of this one.
Minga.
You may go.
Sure.
Gently, gently.
Drive carefully.
Jesus. It's a hit.
We still haven't got the food.
What are we gonna eat?
Oh, Franco, where you been? Your mother called. She's been looking for you.
Now you make jokes on my mother?
No, no, about your mother, not on your mother, Franco.
I wouldn't get on your mother.
Just like in Monte Carlo. Jokes.
You insult me, you insult my family, you insult my country...
...my honor, my dignity you insult!
I warned you!
But you wouldn't listen!
No more jokes.
You see this?
No more jokes!
Very good, Franco.
- You like?
- Yeah, it's very nice.
Where is the...? The professore.
Professore in the pee-pee.
Are you always like this?
Franco is ready.
The race can begin.
Here we go, Andy.
Porsche, two.
- Good for you.
- Six for the Dodge.
- All right.
- Cobra, four.
Three, Ferrari.
Jaguar, 10.
Take your number there.
Number one.
Number eight. Who's holding eight?
It's Lapchik, the lone eagle.
Those are your starting positions.
Jose will start every vehicle.
You got something to do.
You're starting times will be registered here and in Long Beach.
And your elapsed time will all be verified.
So that's it. Let's get some rest.
It's done, brother.
Go.
Okay. Get ready.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.
And now, my friend...
...the first rule of Italian driving.
What's behind me is not important.
Buddy, here's to us, and that we get there first.
Give New York one of those famous rebel yells of yours when we hit the street.
You know, just to start my blood.
Camaro, 6:00. Go.
- Porsche, 6 and 10.
- Go.
- It's going down.
- Off.
What's the matter with you?
Where are you?
- Cobra, 6:00 and 30 seconds.
- Go.
They're not gonna do it again.
Mercedes, 6 and 40. Go.
You animal.
51 st Street.
Bravo. Times Square.
It's gonna be a nice day.
Good morning.
Good morning to you.
Miserable son of a bitch.
Hey, fella, can you loan me a dime?
- Drop your pants.
- Look, I'm a cop on the job.
I'm Robin Hood.
- Drop them.
- Okay.
- Real easy, fella.
- Drop them.
It's okay, it's okay.
Okay, just stay calm.
Honk if you're horny.
Hit it.
Hit it.
Put your foot in it.
- You can't go back. It's one-way.
- What do you want me to do?
- Will you calm down?
- You should've checked the route.
I mean, wait, you blaming me?
Damn it. This is one-way too.
I am only going one way.
Wake up, meatheads. Another great day is starting in New York City, the Big Apple.
Get up, get ready, the Giants won
7-zip, believe it or not.
The Age of Aquarius is really on us.
Now, the Eastern Standard Time is five minutes past 6:00.
You wanna go fast?
No, that's all right.
We got plenty of time.
Hey! Watch where you're going!
Now we take a left over here, right?
But we gotta go left.
Look out, Joe! You're gonna ruin the car.
What's the matter with you?
Will you take it easy for God sakes?
Joey, slow down a minute.
- Wait a minute. Make a left.
- I'm not lost, so shut up.
Hey, did you know there's a hole back there?
No shit.
And a hungry smile.
Can you look hungry?
This is Uncle Bruce.
Hussy, get hungry. Hungry,
$ 150-a-night hungry, for me.
You know the feeling.
Good, good, I like that. I love that.
I love that look. Fan. Hungry fans.
Click. Thank you. Thank you.
That's the end of the session.
It's been all right.
Hey, baby. How do you like it?
Oh, terrific. You stole it, right?
Come on, I'm in a rush. Come on, get in.
Let me have that, here.
- So how do you like it, huh?
- This is real class.
I mean, real class.
Come on, turn it on.
- What, is this the switch?
- That's it.
Hey, maybe we should wait.
Christ, if this thing works...
Some city you got here.
I didn't know what size.
I said, better too big than too little.
- Did you get any?
- We didn't put it up.
- We were waiting to hear from you.
- They snipped my radio.
- How about your car?
- The wheels fell off.
Oh, those guys sound mean.
- Take me to the airport.
- Now?
Hey, you gotta learn to roll with the punches, Roscoe.
Harold, how you been?
Hey, that's Crazy Harold.
How long do we have to drive anyway?
If we're lucky, about 35 hours.
- Where we going, Cuba?
- No, Long Beach, California.
- Stop.
- No, I can't.
No, no, stop.
You pull over to the side and stop.
- Let me out.
- I forgot to tell you something.
- I'm in a race, and I can't go back.
- I don't care.
- I'm getting out.
- You gotta stay.
- Just pull over, or I'm jumping.
- No, wait a minute.
Close that door.
Take it easy, now. Just take it easy.
We'll get there.
From the garage to the Jersey Turnpike, six minutes, 58 seconds.
- That's 15 seconds better than last year.
- Terrific.
You got the snooper working?
- Get a weather report on the CB.
- You got it.
All you truckers out there, this is Big Ben in Jolly Green.
We got a little light snow coming in from Pennsylvania.
Roll on, yellow Camaro.
Exact change, 25 cents.
Well, we're heading south.
We got plenty of open road.
- You're a spastic.
- I was also all-state in basketball.
- That's it. No more quarters.
- Get out of the car.
- You got a quarter?
- Get out of the car.
Get that tin can out of the way.
- Where do you think it is?
- Under the car.
- What?
- Under the car.
If I was a quarter, where would I be?
Where did it go?
Pull on through. Park in section D.
How about explaining that last move?
- What's a Smokey the Bear?
- Highway patrol.
- Plain brown wrapper?
- City policeman.
Unmarked car? Police car.
- County Mountie?
- County sheriff.
- And a local yokel?
- City policeman.
You're so smart. Next time out I'll make sure you get a driver's license.
Well, happy hunting, Roscoe.
Sorry about the pants.
And you call yourself New York's finest.
Well, I got you all out of New York.
See you later, Sir Roscoe.
Taxi.
- The crusade is straight ahead.
- Taxi.
Now, our crew is going ahead in a plane.
They got spare parts, everything we're gonna need.
Now, I've got all these stops here marked and coordinated.
Beautiful.
- What the hell are you doing?
- She is magnificent.
Look, this is a race, man.
Some things are more important than winning.
Maybe the float's stuck.
Maybe it's humidity.
England is humid.
I feel like Moses at the parting of the Red Sea.
- Hey, man, this is no good.
- What's the matter, huh?
Well, take a look. It's too easy.
Yeah. Yeah, it's too easy until somebody nails us.
This is Flying Lasagna coming into the oven, do you copy?
The oven is hot.
See that gas station? Let's pull off there.
Let's get ready. One man take them...
- Brilliant. Brilliant.
- Thank you.
- Preston?
- What do you want?
I gotta take a leak.
No, I won't stop so you can take a piss.
- There's a bottle in the back.
- I can't do that.
- I'm not gonna stop till we need gas.
- I can't hold it, buddy.
I'm telling you, use the bottle.
I tried this once going 60.
Didn't work then.
Well, if you're coordinated, once you start, you won't stop.
Hey. Come on.
Stop.
I'm getting this all over my hands.
My hands are wet.
You're a dumb son of a bitch sometimes.
I don't know why I hang around with you.
I wouldn't have done this to you.
Those dirty son of a bitches.
I hope there's tough justice in Illinois.
I wanna nail them, sheriff, and this ought to do it.
- Then what?
- Then I'm gonna turn them over to you.
And you can throw away the key. You'll be doing this country a favor, that's what.
Now we can start running.
How's our time?
Right on schedule.
I wonder what old Roscoe is doing now.
Developing an ulcer.
Steady, huh?
She is happy.
They're coming.
Goddamn, was that Roscoe?
I wonder if he set us up.
Oh, terrific.
I got them now.
Jeez, I'd love to see the look on their faces.
- How fast are you going?
- Just 100.
- Well, let's hit it, avanti.
- Thank you, my dear friend.
- Jesus, we're going over 100 knots.
- Well, come on. Step it up, buddy.
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Sir, we can't catch them.
He must be going 180 miles per hour.
We don't even have a fixed-wing airplane that can catch that.
Now what?
Take me to the airport.
It's a handsome design.
I wish it ran.
I'm gonna tell you.
This thing handles like a pig.
It'll get better.
Wait till we use up some gas.
This thing's a bear to handle.
- What the hell, Harry?
- I don't know, did we break anything?
- Maybe we better stop.
- Are you kidding?
- I think it's all right.
- Roll on.
What's wrong with him?
I think he's having a nightmare.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Fire. Fire.
- You can't outrun it, you asshole.
Pull that thing off the road.
I hope you learn from this experience.
I made this drive once before in 1946 in a Mercury coupe.
- Is that so?
- But it's different now.
- Yes, newer roads, older bodies.
- Yeah, too much, too late.
But if I have to die, Andy,
I want to die trying.
Good.
Would you say that man Lapchik has a certain joie de vivre?
I'd say he's possessed of a severe case of masochism.
I think it was a meteor, that's what it was.
- You okay, huh? You okay?
- Yeah, I think so.
Who's that guy?
- Keep your eye on the road.
- Just getting my rhythm up.
Keep up the speed, will you?
I am keeping up the speed.
It's so boring out here...
...my mind's drifting.
This is America, Gibson.
America's not boring.
Yeah, well, motel signs, café signs, one-way signs, "do not enter" signs...
...and every other kind of sign, it all looks the same to me.
Now, back there we saw a reptile farm.
That's more right down my alley.
Get my hands on a boa contractor.
The word is "constrictor."
And don't slow down. Move it.
- Why did I pick him for a mechanic?
- Because I'm the best, that's why.
Oh, what in the name of farm corn did he come from?
I told you to keep your eyes on the road.
How am I supposed to keep my eyes on the road, have a good time...
...think about my girlfriend and do all that? Tell me.
You're a product of too much inbreeding.
Watch out, P.D.
Hit it. You got yours.
It's those damn fake cops.
- Will you move it now?
- Damn it if you can't take a joke.
I wanna go home.
You say you wanna be a movie star, that you wanna be somebody.
I mean, you take acting classes, you take dance classes, you work hard.
Where the hell do you think you're gonna be discovered?
Standing on a corner in Queens?
I mean, baby, listen, now...
...in Hollywood.
- Do you really think so?
- Baby, I really like you.
You should try to be nice to me.
You know, you should try to understand.
I do.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Don't grab the wheel.
Brake!
Hey, you!
Jesus Christ.
Whitey, Whitey, you okay, boy?
Talk to me.
Hello out there, this is Hoosier.
I'm a-coming in from the Cactus Patch.
Rolling on to Derby City.
Got Smokeys all over 40 giving out green stamps...
...as you ride the cloverleaf into the Buckeye, hear?
You can put the hammer down and watch out for two little beavers...
...in a black speedboat coming your way, as they are broken.
They got ears. Do you copy?
That damn Smith.
He's the one who links up all this mess.
He's a damned overaged juvenile delinquent, and I want him.
- I wanna suspend his license in perpetuity.
- Who's Smith?
The thorn in my side, captain.
The cloud over my head.
Baker spotted them about five miles back.
They should be here soon. They're flying.
They must be doing over 160.
I never saw anything so damn fast.
I got them. Get everybody in position.
Come on, let's go get them.
See this truck up here?
Pull in behind it and blow the horn.
Fantastic.
I thought you'd like that.
Bravo, bravo!
Maybe they stopped.
Send a car up the road.
- What's up?
- Any speeders pass you back there?
- Nobody passed me within 15 miles.
- Okay, get out of here.
What happened? Somebody rob a bank?
None of your damn business.
Just move it out.
There's no sign of them anywhere.
Well, they couldn't just have vanished into thin air.
I'll be a son of a...
Where are you going?
Follow me.
Open it up.
Open it!
Are you happy?
Get it out of here.
It's so easy on these interstates.
Can you imagine making this trip at 55 miles an hour?
- Fifty-five miles an hour is unsafe.
- It's boring.
That's why it's unsafe.
Well, it's fast enough to kill you, but it's slow enough to make you think you're safe.
What time have you got?
- Six o'clock.
- Great. Twelve hours.
One-third of the trip.
I think it's terminal.
This is Casey Kasem on American Top 40.
In Colorado Springs...
...you're listening to Casey Kasem's
American Top 40, on KYFM...
...where the temperature is now 34 degrees and dropping.
Hey, hey, fella. What's the matter?
You cold or something?
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey. Take it easy, okay?
Everything's gonna be okay.
Stay calm, okay? Stay calm. Okay?
Okay, Dr Pepper?
- Okay.
- Chop-chop. Let's go, huh?
Okay, let's make it. Hey, my man.
Boy, attaboy.
- There's those damn fake cops.
- They see us?
Let's not wait around to find out.
Yeah, it's Oklahoma.
Land of the red man.
Land of the cowboy.
Land of the cow and the dog.
Sailing, Ace.
You're sailing, buddy.
- I don't believe it.
- What?
It's those guys.
I think they're gonna pull the same stunt.
- They must think you're stupid.
- Yeah...
Boy, that car moves.
Well, put it on 140.
If he catches us, I'll eat my Airedale.
Hey, that's a real sheriff, man.
That is a real sheriff.
I'll get you, you mother...
He lost his engine.
Go get them, fellas. Get them.
Go get them. He went that way.
Catch up to them. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.
I thought you said you could drive.
What the hell you talking about?
There was oil there on the road.
Fill it up, please.
Shut it off. Shut if off.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Where are you going?
- Los Angeles.
- Driving all night?
- Yes.
- Alone?
- Yes.
- You like me?
- Yes.
Excuse, one moment. Don't go away.
I have a small problem.
- A small problem, huh?
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure you do. Forget it...
She's very sweet.
- She's got breasts like ripe melons.
- Forget it, will you? Come on. Let's go.
She's beautiful. She wants me now.
I cannot deny her.
That's impossible.
- She's so sweet. We can make up the time.
- Impossible. Forget it.
- Get in the car, will you?
- No. No, no. I don't get into the car, no.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Arrivederci, my friend.
- I hate beer.
- Yeah, you hate everything.
- I'm getting real bored lately.
- What you're getting is real boring lately.
- Did you see that one?
- Foreign job.
- Yeah, and it had two girls in it.
- Let's go. Go, go.
We got a terrific stretch of road the next 25 miles.
Don't do anything weird, Joe.
The last time they locked us up.
Don't worry about it.
These dollies are ready.
Hey, they're kind of cute.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding.
- Yeah.
Maybe I'll just tease them a little bit and have some fun.
- Howdy, ma'am.
- Howdy, mister.
Hey, where do you wind this thing up?
- Hey, you old enough to drink?
- I'm old enough to do a lot of things.
Did I tell you? Did I tell you? Hey, slow that thing down. It's gonna break.
- What do you want to do, play doctor?
- Oh, I'm in love. I'm in love.
Sweetheart, if you catch me...
...you can have me.
Are you kidding?
Go. Go.
Go. This is a dream come true.
Get on them.
- Go.
- That was really dumb.
Oh, they'll never catch up with us.
Drive, Earl. Drive.
Well, goddamn,
Franco's gonna miss all the fun.
Goddamn.
- Where's Franco?
- We must have lost him somewhere.
It's a difficult thing to think about at 2:00 in the morning.
Well, I guess I can ease up now.
Feeling better?
Oh, my God.
Well?
Andy, I need an inspiration.
- Yes, it's that time of morning.
- Something to make the blood hot.
What would you say to a bit of Henry V?
Oh, you're a mind reader.
Once more into the breach, dear friends, once more.
Follow your spirit, and on this charge cry:
"God for Harry,
England and St. George!"
Christ.
I hope Lapchik the mad Hungarian sees that.
He came off right here.
He's gotta be down there.
Man, he's gotta be down there.
Hey. Hey, fella, you all right?
They're gonna be leaving Nevada on Interstate 15.
That's the way they're gonna be coming.
Through this junction.
- We haven't had too much luck before.
- Yeah, but they were forewarned.
They've got CB radios.
They can listen to everything we say.
There was no way around it.
I can't understand how, but they did it.
This time, this time, it's gonna be planned.
- Really planned.
- Boy, you really want them bad.
Gentlemen, this is Roscoe's last stand.
Don't let go of the accelerator.
For you, you lovely American animal.
Remember Franco.
Quickest man I know.
Bye. Bye.
What the hell?
- She can drive, huh?
- Yeah. Bannon and Graves got by last night.
Well, let them have their brief moment of glory.
Yeah. We'll be in Nevada pretty soon.
Nevada. Las Vegas.
City le sensuale. The dancing girls with the bouncing boom-booms.
Oh, shut up, will you, with that.
- Look at that piece there.
- What's that car?
- That's a Rolls Royce.
- Ain't she sweet.
She looks lonely.
I love it, I love it.
Hey, come on, Angie, come on. Let's go.
Come on, let's get her.
Come on, cut that cleaning crap.
Get in the car.
- I wanna get a Coke.
- Get your ass in the car. Come on, Angie.
Angie.
I ain't gonna hurt you.
- Angie.
- Let's look at your bicentennial flag.
Come on, baby, it's gonna be you, you, me and all my friends.
Hey, send her out.
Oh, jeez.
Hey, come on out, we won't hurt you.
- Come on.
- Get out.
I'm gonna get you, faggot.
Go.
You watch that bike.
I'm warning you, you little...
Look what you did.
You got some nerve to go out and get some Coca-Cola.
Come on, go, go. Let's get them.
Those pigs.
Oh, shit, they coming after us.
Oh, you know what's gonna happen now?
They gonna rape you, and they gonna kill me.
Really? Maybe they'll kill me and rape you.
- Do something.
- What?
- I don't know.
- Christ, I hate this country.
Oh, shit. Hey, old buddy.
Wake up, man. Lookie here.
- What now?
- Oh, Jesus.
Turn back 6 yards, then punt.
You know, you fellows were doing just about 90.
Really?
Okay, okay, okay. Cut, cut, cut.
Hey. Hey, man. Was it me?
The line was supposed to be:
"Let me explain."
Oh, damn.
Sure is a funny-looking police car.
Say...
...what police department you fellas from anyway?
- None.
- Impersonating an officer, huh?
- Turn around. Stand easy against the car.
- Hey.
Oh, come on.
We... We're on film right now.
What do you mean, you're on film?
What, are you making a movie?
Yeah, sure. I mean, the camera's right up there on that mountaintop.
Well, nobody informed me about that.
Well, that's obvious. I mean, you think we'd be riding in this rinky-dink police car...
...with chocolate cookies on the dashboard if it weren't for a movie?
Well, I wouldn't know anything about that.
All I know is the law's still the law.
Listen, officer, you...
I mean, absolutely, you're right.
I mean, we were speeding, but...
Oh, hey, wait a minute. This is perfect.
You could help us.
Help you? Help you do what?
Sure.
Sure, the whole mise en scene...
...that leads into the exposition, and the dénouement...
...and the intention. It's perfect...
- Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.
Are you trying to tell me that...
...you want me to be in your movie?
Well, I mean...
...that is, if you've got five minutes, and...
...you know, if you'd like to be in a Hollywood film, sure.
I don't know, l...
Avila, call Clint and see if they're ready, okay?
- And tell them that we have Officer...
- Williams.
Officer Williams here, and we'd like to use him.
God, you sure got a good-looking smile.
Okay. Hey, old buddy...
...they wanna see his face.
Officer Williams, step down here by your car for me.
- For just a second, would you, please?
- Sure.
Stand over here or something. Pose.
You know, something like that, huh?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- This is preliminary stuff for the camera.
- Sure.
- Focus, stuff like that.
- Sure.
- How's that?
- Okay?
Yeah, fine.
Just turn the chin around a little.
- Yeah.
- No, no... Just a...
Just give me the chin a little bit this way.
- That...
- Oh, I see what you mean.
Yeah, you got it.
God, you got a great profile.
Hey, old buddy, they got it and they say it's A-okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Listen, this is what we're gonna do.
Avila and I are gonna get in the car and go down about two miles, okay?
We're gonna turn around and come barrel-assing...
...back through this way.
- Then you get in your...
- I get in my car and chase you.
You got it, that's it. Perfect.
Hey, wait a minute.
Don't I gotta put on some makeup?
Makeup?
Hey, does Charlie Bronson wear makeup?
Charlie who?
Bronson.
Oh, yeah. That little guy. Right.
- All right, buddy. Let's go, they're rolling.
- Oh, okay.
Scene 14, take two, hand mark.
Come on, now.
Let me see those pearly whites. Smile.
That's it. Action.
God, can't you turn off the heater?
Either the engine gets hot, or we get hot.
Well, I'm gonna have a stroke.
You're gonna have a stroke?
I should be so lucky.
Because if you don't stop playing that music...
I can't stand you!
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you!
I liked Joe.
He was sweet.
Aren't you gonna talk to me anymore?
You gotta admit, he was a good mechanic.
He fixed the car faster than we could.
Furthermore...
...we didn't lose much time.
We made time, as a matter of fact.
It was love at first sight.
Are you crazy?
Love at first sight?
Out there? The middle of the night?
The middle of a field under the stars?
A girl can't always find the perfect spot.
I think Roscoe's gonna give it one more try before L.A.
I didn't hear anything on the radio.
- Maybe he's getting smart.
- Howdy.
Howdy.
Couldn't help but overhear your conversation.
Wrong, thank you.
- I'm gonna get back on the road.
- No, no.
Too many police cars go down the road this morning.
- See where they went?
- Nope...
...but I could find out.
Well, you got a deal.
You guys seem to need a rabbit.
- Are you volunteering?
- Oh, listen, listen.
I play, but l... I play for pay.
You want the road cleared out, it's gonna cost you $500 cash...
...paid in advance.
Five hundred dollars, paid in advance?
Could be worth it.
Yeah, well...
...suit yourselves, okay?
What the hell's the matter with him?
Don't make babies like this anymore.
Give me six for the lead time, okay?
That's the ugliest car I ever saw.
Looks like a jukebox.
Well, they got them, right behind me yet.
- Ferrari and a Cobra.
- How far back?
I don't wanna talk about that.
Let's have the money, huh?
That's it, that's it.
There, that's good.
Thanks...
...lieutenant.
- Get out of here.
- Want one of those?
- No, thanks.
You know...
...I smell something.
- You smell something?
Yeah, a weasel in a rabbit suit.
Old Roscoe, huh?
Maybe we're being too cynical.
- We should be more positive, more trusting.
- Oh, get out of here, will you?
Let's go.
Sam.
We're 27 minutes ahead of last year's schedule.
But Franco's driving again.
Well, with a little bit of luck and some pure Yankee style...
All right, you two, on the hill with the other car.
All right, everybody, hear this.
It's plan B. Move out.
Come on, now, move out. Get moving.
Number one, move it. Go in.
Come on, you guys. Let's hustle it here.
Come on!
Take it out of here.
How inadequate.
Fifty-five miles an hour, Roscoe.
No.
Why?
Why me?
You're an asshole, Roscoe, that's why.
Well, good morning to you too.
How can you fall asleep?
It was easy, you said, "Relax."
And the car is comfortable.
Comfortable? It's a $40.000 car.
Of course it's comfortable.
When we get to Hollywood, if you like it so much, I'll buy you one.
- What's the matter with you?
- Hollywood.
Nothing's the matter.
You're so goddamn stupid.
You think you'll walk the streets of Hollywood, meet a producer...
- What are you talking about?
- He'll make you a movie star.
You told me that if I went...
I told you a lot of things because you were freaking out on me.
- All I wanted you was... For you to like me.
- I like you.
- For you to be... You like me?
- Yes, I like you.
I been thinking all night...
...and I'll tell you what.
You ain't right for me.
You're a goddamn hustler.
- That's what you are.
- You wanna know who I am?
I'm the girl who's gonna punch you in the nose.
You don't understand anything about me!
What's that? What the hell is that?
Look at that.
- Oh, what is this?
- Slow down.
Why does it always happen to me?
Believe this?
Wait, I'm trying to drive.
- Slow down.
- I can't. You crazy?
- How am I gonna slow down?
- Would you just...?
I can't see. Look at...
What the hell was that?
What the hell was that?
Oh, my God.
Oh, this is cute.
Oh, my God.
Look what happened.
Hello, smart boy.
You know what we do to finks and traitors?
- It was a joke, man...
- A joke?
- Sorry, man...
- You're sorry, huh?
- Listen...
- After it's too late to do anything about it?
I am going to mark you with the gumball gun.
No.
Now you are marked...
...for life!
Vitamin C?
Just for good luck.
You really think we got a chance?
Hey, Roscoe.
- Las Vegas, now arriving...
- Don't ask, Clancy.
- What happened?
Look, I'm tired. All I wanna do is go home. They beat me.
- You understand?
- Didn't you nail any of them?
- Look, just don't ask me.
- Jesus, Roscoe, all that...
- Clancy!
- Roscoe...
...you look terrible.
Well it's one of those
Los Angeles days, Gene.
We're hovering over the Civic Center.
We can see traffic backing up.
We got a sig alert working on Santa Monica...
...and the Pasadena is jammed as usual.
Golden State's moving, but just barely.
And the Long Beach is a sea of cars.
Should continue to be like this for another hour.
Be advised, take surface streets wherever possible...
...and try to stay calm and composed.
There must be another way.
God, oh, God.
Christ.
The engine is too hot.
I guess we're just a little bit too smart for them, old buddy.
That's right, my friend.
Smooth sailing to Long Beach.
Yep, I think I'll have me a cigar.
My wife's pregnant.
- Come on, give me a hand, will you?
- Bug off, jerk.
Oh, no.
Avila, no way.
I don't wanna hear it, Avila.
To serve and to protect, huh?
Officer. Right here.
Hold it. Hold it, officer.
Oh, God, thank you, officer.
Help! My wife is pregnant.
She's gonna have the baby.
Her water just broke.
I tried to get these...
They won't help me.
They haven't helped.
Come on. Help me.
You assholes!
Jesus, I'm grateful.
- They don't even care.
- Okay, now.
Just be cool, be calm.
We'll take care of everything.
- Don't... Please don't bite my hand.
- Yeah, you!
Wait! Wait! Wait a minute.
We can use the river.
There's an access road to the right.
It runs all the way to Long Beach.
- No, no. West, west.
- West?
West.
Look at that.
Look at that. That's Bannon.
What the hell? Get off of here.
Get off.
Where's the next one?
On your left.
Okay.
Look out, you damn fool.
- Right out of there.
- You're not allowed down there.
Up yours.
You can't go down there. Stop.
Don't slow down, hit it.
I never raced in a river before.
Okay, the lights are set for 32 miles per hour.
- Right.
- Just keep going on Sepulveda.
Okay, hang on.
Smile.
What are we going now?
Thirty-two miles an hour.
Looks like we've got some water coming up.
- I don't see anything.
- How deep is it here?
Here goes.
Hold it. Keep the rims high.
Don't slow it up.
I can't see anything.
Come on. Come on.
Take him. Take him.
Watch out for the slick places.
Let's go. Let's go.
Okay, okay, okay. Let's go.
There's a real big drain coming up.
Really hustle.
All right, now, now.
Now.
You got him. You got him.
Where do we turn?
What are they doing?
Into it, into it.
Turn coming up. Turn coming up.
Where's Franco now?
Damn it!
What do you say, Franco?
Block him on this turn.
Stay on him, Sam.
- Ride him. Ride him.
- Watch out.
Hang on. Hang on, now.
- Change your gear.
- Move, now. Move, move, move.
I tell you what the trouble is with you, Ace.
You don't have a sense of humor.
This is rigged for fun.
- Don't talk to me.
- Well, come on, buddy, cheer up.
We're just about there.
Just about smell the Queen Mary's butt.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Now this is style.
We'll come whipping in on two wheels.
Hey, I've seen you do it 100 times.
I practiced.
Think I can get in the show?
I think you're making a mistake.
No, I got this on the road.
Damn. Almost had it.
What do you think I did wrong?
I think I'm gonna be sick.
It's a wreck or something.
It always happens when I'm in a hurry.
Oh, my God.
You wrecked my car, you jerk.
You dumb jerk, look at my car.
What do you think you're doing?
You got a driver's license?
You people see what he did to my car?
I don't care. I have no money.
If you wanna put me in jail, it's okay with me, I can use the sleep.
I was just about to get the car repainted anyway.
Oh, this is my girlfriend, Angie, from New York.
Are you sure everything's okay,
Mr. Blakely?
You wouldn't happen to be an actress, would you, Miss?
Blanche. Why, yes. How'd you guess?
Well, you have what we call...
...presence.
Well, if it bothers you,
I can put on my jacket.
Why don't we go inside.
I have to do a lot of entertaining.
I'm in the movie business, and it's part of the game.
Go, baby!
What's the matter...?
What's the matter with you?
Am I clear?
Yes, you're clear.
Cut them off, cut them off.
Good going.
Just make it to that parking lot.
It's only two miles.
No problem. Relax, relax.
Clear on your right.
There it is.
Let's hope
Emergency Plan Alpha works.
Emergency Plan Alpha?
Go.
Get them, damn it, quick.
Oh, that's a cheap move.
Terrific.
Take them.
On the right. On the right.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Get him now.
Okay.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
- Hey.
- It worked. It worked.
It's a trap. Get out of here.
Oh, no. Jesus.
- I'll come back.
- Wait, Franco.
Franco.
Franco, wait. Franco.
Thirty-three hours and 57 minutes.
A new record. How's that, Mike?
- Great going, Sam.
- I thought you were in traffic.
Smith was going down.
Hey, two more.
Alice and Jane and the cops.
I wanna thank my mother, my friends.
I wanna thank my loved ones, you...
Hey, listen, listen. I wanna thank you guys for me and Mr. Guts.
If you hadn't picked us up, we'd have still been on the freeways of America.
What do you say we celebrate, huh?
Get over here.
Hey. Shut up. Shut up.
What can I say?
It just... Just makes me sick.
- Angie.
- Where did he come from?
Angie, baby.
Oh, baby.
Hey, Roscoe.
Roscoe.
Come on, have a drink.
Don't add insult to injury, Bannon.
Maybe next year.
There isn't gonna be any next year.
I'm retiring. You're not gonna have Roscoe to kick around anymore.
Wouldn't be the same without you.
Someday, Bannon, you and Smith.
Well, you know, I was thinking about retiring too.
No, really.
It's a raid.
Get those trucks over here.
Hustle, hustle, hustle. Out of the way.
Come on, come on.
Okay, come on, move them out.
That's the ticket. Do that.
What's going on here?
Well, as of 11:00, you are illegally parked.
That's according to California
Vehicle Code number 22658. 22658.
- I want your name.
- Get on, man.
At any rate, the fines will be levied, and they will be hauled away.
Perfect.
Move them out. That's right.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
Move them out. That's the idea.
Get that one going.
Come on, come on, move it along.
Move it along here. Come on.
Get out of here.
That's right, that's right. All right.
Hey, hey.
- We're a bit late.
- I hope we didn't miss the fun.
Maybe next year.
How are you gonna get back to New York?
I hadn't given it much thought.
This is ridiculous.
Where do you get cars around here?
Come on, it's America, babe.
Gumball.
Gumball.
- Gumball.
- Gumball.
- Gumball.
- Gumball.
He's here.
- What the hell is he doing?
- Looks like his throttle is stuck.
Oh, shit!
- I hope those lines hold.
- Hold on. Hold on, Wilbur.
Hold on to the wheel.
I'm sick.
- Shut that window, Wilbur.
- All right, I'm trying.
I'll help you, Wilbur.
Mike, look out.
Bloody hell.
Get her below, or I'll kill her.
- Hey, I was...
- I'm telling you!
Get her... Get her out of here!
- Get below!
- I'm going.
I don't understand you.
I'm going down now.
Get below.
Oh, God, not that.
What a hell of a way to spend New Year's Eve.
How did you even find someone like that?
Mike, I told you,
I didn't find her, she found me.
She saved my ass the other night in a bar.
Two guys were trying to roll me, and she comes up... and hits one over the head with a bottle... and the other one, she just kicked in that spot where it hurts most.
You should've seen her.
You should've been there.
It's okay, it's okay.
I caught her act last night.
Well, it could've been worse.
Remember that spider monkey
I brought aboard last year?
Sorry.
The only difference so far is the real monkey didn't apologize.
Morning.
- Here.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
Hey, look, I'm really sorry about last night.
Usually I'm totally terrific on boats.
- What's this supposed to be?
- Coffee.
Try again.
Listen, ace, it's not exactly the Waldorf down there.
Mine's okay, Mike.
At least it's hot.
Try again.
If I'd known I was gonna be sailing with Captain Bligh...
I'd have stayed put up in my chateau in the Riviera.
Chateau? Is that what the other girls called it?
Hey, wait a minute.
Now, that's untrue and totally unfair.
- And absolutely, totally...
- I'm sorry, hon.
I really am sorry.
Yeah. I can see you are.
That's okay.
She's a good kid, Mike.
Really, she is.
She's just trying to get to Africa.
I know, I know.
But it'd be so much nicer if somehow all of this was someone's fault.
Come on now. When we get back to Marseille, you're going to the bank.
You'll extend the mortgage on the boat, that's what you'll do.
Mike, losing your cargo in a storm like that, the bank will understand.
Oh, sure.
In times of real trouble... one thing a man can depend on is the sympathy of a bank.
Come on, now.
Hey, take a look up there.
Chopper, right?
French coast guard.
For them to be out this far, some ship must be in big trouble.
What am I thinking, Wilbur?
- Tell me.
- Salvage.
- You're thinking salvage.
- Salvage, hell.
Salvation.
Some poor devil is stranded out there.
Get a fix on that chopper's course and we'll follow it back where it came from.
I knew it.
I knew my luck couldn't be that bad.
Nothing was gonna get worse, because nothing could've.
- Sorry.
- Jesus.
Look what I found.
- Happy New Year.
- I'll drink to that.
Oh, my gosh.
- All those people.
- Yeah, it's a lousy business... when someone's gotta die before you can make a buck.
But, you know... all that salvage is gonna belong to somebody. Why not us?
I hate to be this big party pooper, but aren't we slightly overmatched?
This thing's gonna get a double hernia trying to haul that thing back into shore.
We don't have to.
Not if the French coast guard found a way in.
You're looking at a four-star passenger liner... carrying hundreds of wealthy people on a European cruise.
The only kind of salvage I want out of there is the kind I can carry on my back.
And end up with what? A bagful of credit cards and gold fillings?
Charming.
A quick trip down to the purser's office.
That's where the money and the jewels are.
Maybe even some gold.
In and out and I'll be on my way back.
That was an explosion inside the hull.
Maybe it's trying to tell you something.
Mike.
I gotta get in there before it goes down.
I don't know, she could go down any moment now.
The Andrea Doria stayed up for more than 10 hours.
Well, I stayed up for a week once.
So what?
We're wasting time.
Now, listen,
I'm going in there by myself.
They're about to take my ship away from me... but I've got this chance, and I'm sure as hell gonna take it.
There could be a fortune in there.
And if there is, it's mine.
Wilbur... make ready the skiff.
- Get the monkey to help you.
- Monkey?
I didn't know you guys had a monkey aboard.
Gee, I didn't see one...
Wonderful.
- Ahoy, Jenny, ahoy.
- We've got company.
I'm Dr. Stefan Svevo, and this is the medical rescue ship Irene.
That must be the Poseidon.
We heard her S.O.S. Last night.
Sheer off. I have the salvage rights here.
Captain Michael Turner.
A capsized ship is like a giant air bubble, captain, and there may be survivors.
My paramedics and I could be instrumental in guiding them off.
Give them medical attention, if needed.
The survivors have been taken out.
But you can look and take out any you find.
But only survivors.
I will take out anything else that I find.
Is that understood?
Well, that was my original proposition to you, captain.
Good.
Then we'll start getting our gear together, and I suggest you do the same.
Well, we are prepared to go aboard right now... but, don't worry, captain, we'll wait.
Sorry, not a chance.
Way I see it, you don't have a choice.
How's that?
As I said, I'm in a desperate need to get to North Africa.
You leave me here and sail off without me, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Wilbur, we're gonna tie her up and throw her in the tug.
If you don't come back,
I'll die up here.
- That is a definite possibility.
- Oh, come off it, Turner.
I know you're a tough guy, but you're not a son of a bitch... no matter how bad you want me to think you are, are you?
Sit down.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
I hope you're a religious man, captain.
I've taken the liberty of saying a small prayer for us.
All of us?
Well, it's my feeling that from this time on... our fates are necessarily intertwined.
Good, then you won't be offended... if I remind you of that fact from time to time.
The French coast guard must have cut a hole in the ship.
Skipper, I'm telling you, it's a floating time bomb.
Hazards of the trade. Let's go.
Hold it.
We've gotta find a way down.
Like over there, maybe.
- Where?
- There.
Take a look, Wilbur.
This will do.
Yeah, this'll do it. Come on.
Here, this way.
It's the escape hatch for the engine-room crew.
Coming, monkey?
Why not?
Where are we?
- Looks like a mess.
- It's the gym.
Just hold on and help him.
- What happened?
- The ventilators collapsed.
- You got him?
- I got him.
Come on.
Come on, you can make it.
- How is he?
- He'll be all right.
- Is everyone else all right?
- I'm fine.
Okay, we're locked in.
No way of getting out there now.
Sure there is. There must be another entrance into that engine...
What's so funny, doctor?
Let us in on it.
I'm sure we could all use a good laugh right about now.
I find it ironic, that's all, captain... that I've suddenly become one of the very people I came down here to rescue.
Doctor, that little prayer you said for all of us up there... what sort of religion would that happen to be?
Greek Orthodox.
Greek Orthodox. No kidding?
I'm a Greek Orthodox too... suddenly.
Wilbur, switch the steam off.
Over here.
- Are you the rescue team?
- We used to be.
Last night was the worst
New Year's party I've ever been to.
I mean, everything turns upside down.
What a party. What a night.
Look, I lost my daughter.
- You gotta help me find my daughter.
- Calm down, mister. Just calm down.
I'm Captain Mike Turner... and I have the salvage rights to this wreck.
Now, who are you people?
I'm Gina Rowe, the ship's nurse.
It all happened so quickly.
We never knew what happened.
- Any other survivors?
- There couldn't be.
We can't be sure of that, Suzanne.
Mr. Mazzetti,
Suzanne and myself... we were following some other passengers... and we got separated from them... and we stumbled into the steam room.
It looked like a safe place, at the time.
- It was until that pipe broke.
- Look, forget the pipe.
Help me find my daughter,
I'll give you everything I got.
Understand? Everything.
Let's just get it out of here, okay?
Which way, captain?
We were hoping you'd give us the answer.
Oh, my God.
The rest of your crew, they're on their way down here right now?
No.
Those two over there are my crew.
All of it.
- Just the three of you?
- That's right.
What, did you come by canoe?
You, what are you doing down here?
I'm Dr. Stefan Svevo, Mr. Mazzetti... and I've been asking myself that same question.
Oh, my God.
My daughter, she hated this trip.
She wanted to stay home for Christmas.
I said, "Honey, I want you to see where I fought the war in Italy. Anzio."
Anzio? I've been to Anzio.
Anzio's the pits.
- You sound just like my daughter.
- Easy, Mazzetti.
How well do you know this ship, Gina?
Hardly at all. It's my first voyage.
Well, there must be a deck plan around here somewhere.
There's always one in every section.
Look, I used the gym a couple of times.
Seems like there's a deck plan in the lobby over there.
The ladies stay here.
The rest of you, help me find a deck plan.
Through here.
- I guess I was wrong.
- There it is.
We're here.
Here it is. Here it is.
We found it.
- You found a way out?
- No.
But we found the purser's office.
You're a very single-minded man, captain.
- And some would say callously so.
- Watch out.
The way I see it, doctor, is that we're all trapped here anyway... so I see no reason not to try and get what I originally came for.
Here.
Look, forget the purser's office.
I gotta find my kid.
Mazzetti!
- Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
- Neither did I.
Okay, so I was stupid.
But somebody's gotta do something.
We just can't sit around.
Look, she's alive, I know it.
I can feel it.
Fine. Then you tell us where she is, and we'll all go look for her.
- I don't know.
- Then shut up and calm down.
We have as good a chance of finding your daughter or way out... by heading for the purser's office as anywhere.
And that is through there.
Now let's go.
After you, skipper. Come on.
Keep on moving, that's my philosophy.
I really don't see that there's any alternative.
We're putting our faith in you, captain.
What, you're putting your faith in him?
An hour ago, he's sunbathing up there on the poop deck.
Now he's down in this underwater coffin... trapped with the rest of us, that's how smart he is.
You.
You haven't come forward yet.
You look like a reasonable man.
What do you say we throw in together?
We'll find my daughter and get the hell out of here.
May I see the deck plan, please?
Well, I'm afraid my knowledge of ships and underwater conditions... falls far short of Captain Turner's.
But I am flattered, Mr. Mazzetti, that you'd feel safer being with me.
But at the moment, at least, I'd feel much safer being with the captain.
And, captain, I'm at your service.
Well, I don't seem to have a choice anymore, do I?
By the way, Mazzetti, what rank were you in the war?
If it's any of your business, master sergeant.
Good. Then you'll be used to taking orders from captains.
Move it out, sarge.
Here it is, the purser's office.
Wilbur.
Take this... and hold those wires back.
Do you ladies think you could jump this?
Well, it can't be more than 6 or 7 feet across.
When I was the captain of my college track team... often times, you know, we'd dig this pit...
Well, it can't be much of a jump, can it?
Speak for yourself.
When I was in the Girl Scouts, I once won a medal for the running broad jump.
How many tries they give you?
Best of three?
Show them how it's done, Gina.
Take a run at it.
Look, if you miss, Gina...
Mr. Mazzetti, would you hold that for me, please?
Please, call me Frankie.
Take a run.
All right, Gina.
Come on, sarge, join us.
Don't worry about me, Turner.
- My dress. I don't think I can make it.
- Take it off.
- I beg your pardon?
- Take it off.
He's got a real way with words, doesn't he?
- With apologies, madame. Givenchy?
- It's a copy, actually.
Should we be fortunate enough to get out of here alive...
I'd be very happy to replace it with the real thing.
- Oh, God, hold me, please.
- Oh, brother.
I'm okay.
- Are you gonna be all right?
- As soon as you make it. Go.
Well, I can't, Wilbur, I can't.
I can't make this jump unless you're on the other side...
Shut up, the pair of you, and one of you jump.
- Right. Wilbur.
- Hold the wires back for him.
Come on.
Just a minute. Take a run.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- I have the shortest legs of any of us.
- Shut up and come now!
- Okay, here I come. Are you ready?
- Yes.
Okay.
That's a hell of a track team you belonged to.
Actually, my specialty was the discus.
- Get out of here.
- I was good at the discus.
The safe, do you see?
- Coming, doctor?
- Well, I've been thinking, captain.
We'll separate into two camps.
We'll go aft... and you and your party continue forward.
Is that an order?
Hopefully it's a constructive suggestion.
All right, doctor, we'll play it your way.
Hey, look, we're wasting time.
This ship could blow up or go down any second.
We gotta find my daughter.
- She could be anywhere.
- Mike.
Look, she's not here.
Let's look somewhere else.
- Think we need the plastique?
- I don't know.
- Did you ever live with a safe cracker?
- Absolutely.
Of course, I didn't know at the time.
She's not in the safe,
I can tell you that.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
That's okay, Mike, don't worry about me. I'm just fine too.
Well, what do you know.
Now, that's one way to crack a safe.
- Where do you think you're going?
- Let's not wait around for the cops.
- How much you think they're worth?
A hundred times its weight in gold.
Bort.
- What?
- Bort.
- What's that?
- Industrial diamonds.
How much are they worth?
Oh, I'd say 3 to 400,000 dollars' worth.
Now, wait a minute.
Tell me the truth, is this really ours?
Yeah, the law of salvage.
Pack up and let's get out of here.
Can you see us now, Mike? Can you see us along the Riviera now, huh?
Why, we're rich.
You know what? We don't need a bank anymore, do we, huh?
No bank for us anymore.
We're filthy, stinking...
Great, great. So you're all rich.
Puke, son.
That's fine Saint-Emilion, 19 and 61.
Whole ship's rocking pretty bad, ain't it, captain?
How you doing, Tex?
Well, I gotta confess,
I've had smoother crossings in my day.
Name's Dewey Hopkins.
I'm from Big D, Texas.
That's Dallas, folks.
With your permission, captain,
I'd like to buy the house a round.
Much obliged, Tex, but we're here on a pretty tricky, salvage operation.
I'm Captain Mike Turner, this here's Wilbur and Celeste, my crew.
- How you doing?
- Pleased to meet you.
Tell you what, Captain Mike.
You just salvaged yours truly out of this here wreck.
There's 100,000 in it for your trouble.
I can't take your money, Tex.
Anyway, I don't need it now.
Well, as one man of substance to another, let's go right to the mat.
I mean, let's not pussyfoot around.
A hundred and fifty thousand for the three of us.
They're with me.
There's nobody there, sport.
- You're seeing double.
- Triple, maybe.
They must've got lost.
Hey!
Hey, come on out here, y'all... and get yourselves rescued.
- Theresa! Theresa!
- Daddy.
Oh, thank God.
Thank you.
- Would somebody catch this, please?
- My baby.
Thank God.
- Thank you.
- I didn't think I'd see you again.
I love you, baby.
He knew she was alive somewhere.
He just knew it.
- Oh, my baby.
- Daddy, this is Larry Simpson.
He saved my life.
I was coming down in the elevator and the ship turned over.
- I was operating it.
- My baby.
We tried to get out, but the passageway was on fire.
I fainted, but he pulled me out.
My baby. Look, look, kid, I...
I'm never gonna forget you for this.
Here, here. Your dress is torn.
All right, folks... let's wet ourselves down for safety's sake... and get this herd on the road for home.
Here.
Wrong year?
Wrong time, Tex.
All right, now, we've found what we wanted.
Each one of you fill a bag with gold or diamonds and carry it out.
Everyone gets 10 percent of what they carry.
Diamonds.
Look, we don't want your filthy loot around our necks.
Just get us the hell out of here.
Well, perhaps just a few.
Ten percent of this will pay off the balance on my folks' farm.
Maybe buy me one too.
- You, a farmer?
- I will be if I get out of here alive.
Look here, Mr. Hopkins.
We've all gotta have our wits about us from now on... so as they say in Dallas, drop the bottle, Tex.
What I'm a-holding here means more to me than... any two bags of that trash you got there, captain.
Why this is a original Beaune, 1865.
Maybe only six of them left in the whole world.
Now I'd a whole lot rather drink it out in the daylight... but one way or another... it's a pleasure no man's gonna deprive me of.
All right, Tex.
If disaster strikes, I'll try and give you a couple of minutes warning.
Okay, everybody, let's...
Where's Suzanne?
- Probably in the powder room.
- Suzanne?
Suzanne?
Suzanne?
Suzanne?
She's gone, Mike.
- What do you mean, gone?
- Gone. Split. Disappeared.
She could've gone off with Svevo.
Who knows why?
I sure wish I did.
Hazards of the trade, kid.
Hazards of the trade.
Anyone else feel safer with Svevo?
Who's Svevo?
As a matter of fact, who the devil's Suzanne?
All right, let's go, then.
- Mike.
- That's a beautiful bottle.
That's a beautiful bottle of wine.
- Actually...
- Young lady, let me...
Actually, sir, you know, I much prefer a Château Haut-Brion, '50s and '60s.
Odd years. It doesn't really have the bite, but I much prefer the body, you know?
I surely do.
- Young lady, I most certainly do.
- Yeah.
You ever been to Texas?
No, not I myself. But I had a great-granddaddy who died at the Alamo.
- The Alamo?
- Yeah.
- Well, do tell.
- Yeah.
- Hey, monkey, come on.
- Yeah. Coming.
Stefan?
Stefan?
Stefan?
Oh, thank God.
Well, doctor... aren't you even going to say hello?
Here.
Stefan, I'm petrified.
Please, can we just get out of here as quickly as possible?
It took two years to put this thing together.
I mean, do you really believe
I can get off without it?
I've done everything you wanted.
And now I just want to get out.
I...
I understand.
Would I have gotten aboard if I could've avoided it?
But since I'm here, since we're both here... we've got to see this thing through.
Besides, I don't have an option, do I?
No, but I do.
Captain Turner, at least he's looking for a way out.
Well, the choice is yours, Suzanne.
One must do what one must do.
Stefan, I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry too.
- Good luck.
- And you.
Doyle.
Kill her.
Finish her.
Wilbur, is anybody hurt?
Okay up here. Keep moving.
All of you, keep going.
Quick, move down.
Through here.
Quickly, through here.
Wilbur.
Keep going, skipper.
I'll catch up with you.
Mike?
- Mike?
- Coming.
Jesus Christ.
- What should we do?
- Start moving furniture.
All right, all right, let's pitch in.
Come on, kid, give me a hand.
Get the wino to help you.
Nothing personal.
- Move.
- Here, got it.
Wilbur, what's taking so long?
Wilbur?
What do you think you're doing?
- Bag of gold. I lost it.
- The hell with the gold.
- Let's get out here.
- Let me get...
Get out.
You crazy old man, you...
I'm sorry, Wilbur.
Is it that bad?
I'll come along.
Go on up there with the others.
Like hell I will.
I don't want them to see me like this.
Not Celeste, anyway.
It'll pass, Mike.
Believe me, it'll pass.
It always does.
Sure, sure.
I think my body's trying to tell me something.
You don't have to pretend to me, Wilbur.
I know what you've got.
I've been to see that doctor you're always sneaking off to.
You went and saw the...?
What's his name?
Bernheim.
Well, I guess there isn't much we can do about it, is there?
Of course there is, Wilbur.
As of this morning, we have all the money we need for an operation.
- Do you think you can stand?
- Don't help me.
I can stand better than you... for an old man.
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- God.
Mike. Mike.
- Who are you, ma'am?
- I'm Hannah Meredith.
This is my husband, Harold Meredith.
- How do you do?
- It's all right.
You two seem to have taken all of this very calmly.
I mean, why didn't you try to escape?
In our case, it seemed safer just to stay right here.
We couldn't risk being separated outside.
Well, I accept the sentiment, ma'am... but at this particular point, I strongly recommend you come along with us.
It'd be very difficult for us to get out.
Well, I'm gonna have to tell you, ma'am... that where we came in is blocked off.
- The explosions.
- That's right, and there could be more.
- I'm staying here.
- No.
Look, I'm not gonna be a burden to everyone, I...
I'm blind.
I'm not going to leave the cabin without my husband.
Hannah, if you find a safe way out, you can come back.
Without me, you'll have a better chance.
No.
Look, I don't mean to be cruel, and I'm sorry... but I think Mr. Meredith here has a point.
- Daddy!
- Shut up, sarge.
What do you mean?
How much time do we have?
We got an hour?
He'll slow us down.
If it's more than an hour,
I'll come back and get him.
- That's very perverted reasoning.
- Frank, you're a creep.
- You heard Meredith himself talking.
- Shut up.
He'll slow us down.
- I'll be dead. I don't wanna die.
- Shut up. All of you.
They're both coming with us. I leave a single soul alive on this wreck...
I'll throw out my title to the salvage rights.
Oh, that's crap, and you know it.
I'd bet it that you would testify against me.
Now, let's shove off, Meredith.
I'll carry you if I have to.
I can carry my own weight, thank you.
Hey, hey, take it easy, Pops.
Sorry. And it's Harold.
Mind the step, darling.
Everything's different, remember, because the ship's upside down.
Can you imagine that man talking to me as though I were a piece of salvage?
You're luckier than you think,
Mr. Meredith.
Salvage is my business.
- I'll walk along with you.
- I'm the ship's nurse.
Let's have another look at that deck plan.
I think I must have given it to what's-his-name, Dr. Svevo.
He must still have it.
What the hell were you ever sergeant of, Mazzetti?
The Lost Patrol?
Come on.
All right, we know what we're looking for. Let's find it.
This could take hours.
Damn hull could go down at any second.
Unless we get out of here alive, it's all for nothing.
- I'm gonna find a way out.
- You do what you're told.
I know the way out.
I've got the deck plan.
Doyle's dead.
She killed him with an ax.
There's a trail of blood down the passageway.
- Should I go after her?
- No, she won't get very far.
I need you here.
The crate is marked Sprague Pumps.
Find it.
Wires. Here.
- Turn sideways.
- Turn sideways.
They're behind you.
There's fire here on the right.
- Why don't you turn this way.
- Hey, we don't need any more help.
- Keep moving.
- Daddy, he's just trying to be nice.
Look, we don't need nice.
Hold it. Hold it.
I smell grub. Hurry on up, folks.
Move on out and I'll lead the way.
Good Lord, Tex.
No place for a foot race.
Hot dang it.
Would you look at this.
Son of a gun. He sniffed it out.
Well, some folks got a nose for water.
Me, I got a nose for food and oil.
You know, bet there's all kinds of vittles around here if we wanna look for them.
- Hey, Tex.
- Yeah?
Can that educated nose of yours tell me where the tunnel leads?
No, sir, captain, it sure can't.
In that case, all of you take a rest and I'll go find out.
I'm going with you.
I can crawl into smaller places than you can.
No, monkey.
Thanks, Wilbur.
This way.
- Here. Here.
- Thanks, kid.
Here, get something for yourself.
Look.
It's no use.
It's blocked solid.
We're gonna have to...
Hey, we'll find another way out.
- It's all right. It's simple.
- I know that. I know that.
Can't a person just come in here and sit down and cry, for goodness' sakes?
I mean, why do you think I wanted to come in this tunnel?
God, this is not a good day for me.
Honestly, you just don't understand me at all.
Understand you?
I don't even know who you are.
I'm Celeste Whitman.
- Hi.
- Hello.
I came to France a year and a half ago with my boyfriend from Cincinnati.
Where's your boyfriend now?
Cincinnati.
How about those three husbands of yours?
Oh, I was never married.
Of course, I could've been married if I'd wanted to be, a million times.
Millions and millions of times.
- There's no doubt about that. None.
- There's no doubt about it. None.
I mean, I can do anything that I set my mind to do, you know? I mean anything.
I have this very high IQ, if you hadn't noticed... and, I don't know,
I'm just sort of this underachiever.
Underachiever?
You're the toughest monkey on this ship.
- Monkey?
- Yeah.
You call me monkey.
That's cute, that's really cute.
You call me monkey.
I hate that.
I hate to be called monkey.
I mean, maybe it would've helped if I wore my long black evening gown... but then, I packed it away with all the rest of my summer things.
- Oh, I wanna get out of here.
- Celeste. Celeste.
- Celeste.
- What?
I think you're beautiful.
You do?
You gonna kiss me now?
No.
Well, then let's just get the hell out of here.
Come on.
Hey, kid, what are you doing?
Look, what is the problem?
Look, I'm grateful to you, okay?
But we're not out of here yet.
So in the meantime, keep your distance.
- What are you talking about?
- He knows what I mean.
Theresa, what your father is trying to tell you... is he's concerned I'll tear your clothes off... and make love to you here in front of him.
- Hey!
- Stop it.
Stop it, stop it.
Don't you think we have enough problems without that foolishness?
Listen, I run a bar in Morristown,
New Jersey. I know what goes on.
This guy's got one thing on his mind.
I've seen old guys in there with kids as young as my daughter.
Well, thank goodness
I'm only 22 years old, right, Daddy?
Listen, kid, if we get out of here alive,
I'm gonna kill you, you understand?
What are we doing down here?
Sitting on our asses?
You're reading a book, for chrissake.
What else would you suggest until Captain Turner comes back?
How do you know he's coming back?
How do you know they didn't find another way out... and they're leaving us here to rot?
Frank, so help me... you keep running off at the head, you ain't getting one dang sip of this wine.
Hey, Tex, take that wine and shove it sideways.
I'm talking about our lives.
Mazzetti, if you don't stop griping...
I'm coming over there and shut you up for good.
- Come on over here now!
- Stop.
Hey, how's the party?
- You two took long enough.
- Couldn't find a cab.
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing.
Listen, everybody, this shaft's a dead end.
Maybe Svevo found a way out.
Let's go find him.
Mike, it's Suzanne.
Get Gina.
Gina. Let her come first.
Gina, Suzanne.
She's dead.
- Captain, this looks to me like...
- I know, I know.
- I've seen bullet holes before.
- What are you saying here?
There's a killer on the ship somewhere?
It's that guy Svevo.
Maybe.
We only found some of you an hour ago.
We all assume she went after Svevo.
She might not have reached him... but she certainly reached somebody.
We can only assume she might have.
Great.
What do you suggest that we do now, captain?
We have no alternative.
- We have to join Svevo.
- What, and get our head blown off?
If Captain Turner's right and there is a homicidal maniac on board this ship... and it's not Dr. Svevo, then he's in as much danger as we are.
There you go again, "if," "could."
That's not good enough.
Frank, old hoss, just consider the alternatives.
And we have enough now.
Let's get out. It's all here.
All except for what
I came down here to find.
Sprague Pumps. Keep looking.
Load some of those, in the unlikely event... that the others find their way up here before we're finished.
What's so damned important about that one crate?
Only one other person knew the answer to that question... and that's why she had to die.
Dr. Svevo. Sprague Pumps.
Now maybe we got a way up and out.
You ready? Let's go.
- Where the hell are we?
- We're about amidship.
Svevo can't be far off.
He's above us and somewhere forward.
- What is this place?
- I don't know.
There are tanks above us, Mr. Meredith.
Large boiler tanks.
Yeah, for desalinization.
Takes the salt out of the water.
I've seen a lot of those tanks on the docks in Marseilles.
Speaking of Marseilles, how are we gonna get out of here, captain?
This bottle sure is getting heavy.
Take a look. From now on we keep moving upwards towards the surface.
Up there.
Get up there before it starts again.
You first, Meredith.
No, let the others go first.
I haven't got time to argue.
Get up there.
Above the pipe you're holding.
It's about 3 feet.
Stand on this pipe.
- Careful, your head.
- Watch your head. Come on.
Give him your cane.
You got his cane?
Did he make it okay?
Not bad. We're helping Gina up next.
Give me that.
- All right. Come on.
- Take it.
This way. Come on.
- Easy.
- Grab his arm.
- Give me your hand.
- Hold the pipe above your head.
Come on, get your bag.
Come on, honey, give me your hand.
Come on.
- Come on. Hold on.
- Captain.
The hell with it. I'll give you your share.
Get up here.
Hey, come on, honey. Come on.
Frank, Larry, Wilbur, go to the other side. Tex and I will handle this.
- Get out of there, will you?
- I am, I am. Yeah, I am.
Take that side.
Steady. You ready?
Right. Up, steady.
- Quick, look.
- Wilbur, pass it back to Larry.
Push back.
Okay, get it across.
Hold it.
Okay, hold it.
Let me get underneath.
- Push it. There.
- Come on, lift it.
Skipper.
Those doors could be locked tight.
I won't know that till I get there, will I?
Please hurry.
Put your foot in the bucket.
It doesn't look too difficult.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Wilbur, the door's open.
Look out below.
Great.
It's easier now.
I've made a bridge for you.
Okay, who's first?
- I am. I've got the goods.
- Let's go.
Crawl right astraddle of it, little lady.
You ever ride a horse?
Are you serious? She was a professional jockey for five years.
Three, actually.
Frank?
Thanks.
- Keep your eyes on the road.
- Right.
You know, you're really a terrific-looking guy.
That's all right.
- I was gonna pull you up anyway.
- Yeah.
- Cross the grill and wait in the room.
- Right.
- Gina, you're next.
- Okay, here.
Take it easy, Gina.
Take it easy.
- You all right?
- I'm afraid I...
I kept my eyes closed most of the way.
Tell that to Meredith.
Cross the grill carefully and wait in the room with Celeste.
Okay. You next, Hannah.
- You'll watch him?
- How else would I know how to do it.
Give me your hand.
I've gotcha, I've gotcha.
- Put your foot in there carefully.
- Okay.
It's all right, Hal.
I'm up here. I'm safe.
Right hand up here. Now, the rungs are a little higher than a ladder's.
Seems simple enough.
You might say I even have an advantage.
How's that?
Can't see anything below.
Give me the stick.
- Hannah! Hannah!
- Hang on.
Hannah!
Hold on. Hold on.
Put your left hand up.
Give it here.
Put your feet on the rung.
- Hannah!
- Hold on.
- Hannah.
- Pull.
Can you shift his feet?
That's it, slowly.
Now you're right at the top.
Feel the top.
One more, one more.
Now stand still. Let me move.
- Hannah?
- She's all right.
- Hannah!
- She's hurt her shoulder.
That's all.
She just hurt her shoulder.
- Thank goodness.
- Stand still, Meredith.
Let me get her. Don't move.
There's a step there, step over.
Watch her arm. Watch her.
Here, lean over my shoulder if you can.
Easy, easy.
Celeste, get her legs if you can.
Now, there's a pipe right in front of you.
- What can I do to help?
- Open the case, Celeste.
Take it easy.
Lean against there.
Here.
Her shoulder's dislocated.
She won't get very far this way.
What can you do?
Pop it back into place if I can.
It's gonna hurt a great deal,
Mrs. Meredith. I'm so sorry.
Now, step down towards me.
- Everybody, come on up.
- Step down.
Right foot. Don't drop this.
Hannah.
- Okay, you're up now.
- Hurry, hurry. Come on.
Turn you around and sit you down.
Here. Sit down.
You're a hell of a fellow, Meredith.
I don't have that much choice, captain.
- What's the matter?
- Just a leg cramp. I'll be all right.
I'm not used to all this physical exertion.
I've got a few aches and pains myself.
My wife, she'll need a great deal of extra attention now.
You know, she tries to appear brave but...
- Yeah, she's terrified.
- Yeah.
Just like me.
Well, not like you... but terrified, yes.
And you're not?
Captain, I've felt this much fear and apprehension... this much doubt and lack of confidence... in simply trying to cross an unfamiliar room.
Here's your stick.
Thank you.
Thank you, captain, for everything.
Theresa, your father... has he always had such a one-track mind?
Well, you know, his bark is worse than his bite.
He means well.
Yeah, well...
I guess if I had a daughter as pretty as you are...
I'd probably act the same way.
Thank you.
- Wilbur, sarge.
- A body.
- Keep the rest here.
- It's a dead body.
The ax must have been waiting for him as he came around this corner.
- The girl?
- She's gotta be the favorite.
And look where she wound up.
Now we've got Svevo between us and the surface.
Stay here.
All right, we're gonna spread out.
Go down the passageway.
Half on one side, half on the other.
If anything happens, hit the deck and then run like hell.
Come on. Come on.
- Sarge?
- Okay, come on.
Come on, come on.
Watch your foot. Come on.
Do you wanna go first?
Well, you go first, then.
They've been here, that's for sure.
What the hell would they be looking for?
- You guys need a fourth for bridge?
- Turner, look over here.
There's enough here to start a war.
Well, that's a slight exaggeration.
I'm sorry about this, captain.
I had hoped that we would never meet again.
Who's that? What does he want?
He's your basic garden-variety terrorist, and I think he wants to kill us.
Well, however accurate the second part of your statement may be, please... don't confuse me with some politically impotent bomb thrower.
The truth is, I came aboard this ship with a purer motive than Captain Turner... to recover a piece of property which was already mine.
You can take whatever you want from this ship. You're welcome to it.
But these people have come a long way... and all they want right now is to get the hell out of here alive.
Now, as one man of substance to another...
Now, hold on.
Just hear me out, son.
Tell you what, I'll write a check for the whole shebang here... and you can just lay down your little rifles... and we'll all haul ass out of here together. What do you say?
Take a look at that open crate behind me, captain.
I sincerely doubt that your friend over there could reimburse me for that.
Okay, open it. Let's see.
You open that barrel, captain, and we all die.
And I have every reasonable hope of wanting to watch the sun set tonight.
What's this crap you're dishing out here?
What are you trying to tell us?
You got some doomsday machine in there or something?
With the information commonly available today... any enterprising science student could build a nuclear device.
- Uranium?
- Plutonium.
And as the American government is painfully aware... this isn't the first shipment to go astray.
Son, now listen to me.
If I was to tell you that I got certain connections at the Pentagon...?
Then I would have to tell you that my connections are more powerful.
I had never intended to harm anyone, captain.
But as you must realize,
I can't let you go now.
- Get out of here and I'll cover you.
- No way.
No way. We go together.
Get out of here.
They need you more than I do.
Come on. Come on.
Okay. Cover me.
Go.
Hey, kid, get the hell out of here.
What are you doing?
I'm staying.
- All right, kid.
- All right, Daddy.
- Be ready to move, right?
- Right.
- Go.
- Go.
Go!
After them.
Wilbur.
Get in there. Come on.
Steady.
The crates. The crates.
Here, here.
Take cover behind the crates.
Save your ammo.
We've gotta shut that door.
If they can't get at us, they won't hang around long.
Svevo's gotta deliver that plutonium as soon as possible.
Now, when I say go, we rush the door together.
Hey, kid, kid.
Get down there.
Put short bursts into that door until we've tried to close it, okay?
Get down.
- Ready, Larry?
- Ready.
- Ready, sarge?
- Yeah.
Go.
Hey, I knew I wasn't gonna make it out of here.
Turner, take care of my little girl.
I'm all she's got.
You still got a chance.
You gotta get her out of here, you understand?
She's gonna make it.
If I do, she will.
Swear to God?
I swear, sarge.
A grenade.
Aim at that leaky porthole.
We'll blast them open, then lock them in.
They'll drown quickly.
Now.
Hit the deck!
- What's the matter?
- I got hit.
- Daddy.
- Hey, baby.
It's all right.
What are you gonna do without me to yell at you anymore?
I never... I never wanted to yell at you.
I know.
- I tried to be a good father.
- I know.
You, you live your life.
I love you, Daddy.
I love you.
God bless you.
No.
Daddy!
- What happened?
- It's okay.
- It's just a fragment. You're lucky.
- It's my lucky day.
- Let's go.
- How do we get out?
The same way we came in.
What about him? He's still alive.
Well, that's unfortunate, because we're leaving without him.
That porthole's gonna go at any moment.
We gotta find another way out of here, and right now.
What is that metallic sound?
It's a... Like a car banging against the wall.
That's a door, that's not a wall.
It's not a solid sound.
That's... That's a door!
He's right. There is a door.
Move these.
There's a ladder to the right.
Swim for it.
- Hannah.
- Mrs. Meredith, get Mrs. Meredith.
Come on, ma'am.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to hurt you.
Careful. Careful.
Harold! Harold!
Larry, give me the gold.
Hang on, hang on.
Sorry, sorry.
- Oh, God.
- Hang in there.
All right, help.
- Hal, are you all right?
- Yes.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Take it easy. Nice and slow.
You ready? Okay.
I'm here.
Meredith.
I'm sorry.
God.
- Oh, God.
- Take care of him.
Mr. Meredith.
Come on. Sit down. Sit down.
Hey, come on.
Okay, everybody can come in here.
Come on.
Keep an eye on them.
I'm gonna have a look around.
All right, in here.
Come on.
We're staying in here.
You'd be better off paying attention to me.
It's gonna leave a little scar.
Well, at least I've still got my dazzling personality.
Gina, you know what?
This may sound silly... but if I had my way, only one other person would ever see it.
- What do you think?
- Well, I...
I know, he treats me like a creep, but at least he knows I'm alive.
- If we get out of this.
- Yeah.
Tex?
Tex.
- Would you do me a favor?
- Shoot, it's done, little lady.
If I don't get out of here, and you and Mike do... I mean, just if.
Mike has a very big mortgage on his tug... and the Jenny may be the only thing in the world he wants.
Heck, you're loaded.
Would you take care of it for him?
That's not doing nobody a favor.
That's just being decent, hon.
Tex, you're okay.
Can I help you?
Thanks anyway.
You know, you're a kind-hearted lady.
I've been watching you.
You helped Meredith.
And you helped everybody that needed help.
- I am a nurse, you know.
- Oh, yeah, I know.
I'll tell you what else I know.
There are a few I would've liked to have beaned over the head with a bedpan.
I know what you mean.
I was the head nurse for 12 years in a Philadelphia hospital.
- And some of those girls, I...
- Why did you leave?
Well, when they gave me my 20-year gold service pin...
You're not that old.
It suddenly dawned on me that
Philadelphia wasn't quite as romantic... as a Greek isle in the moonlight.
So I resigned and signed on the Poseidon... hoping to add a little spice to my life.
You spiced it up all right.
Happy New Year, everybody.
I think I've found a way out.
- Celeste?
- Yeah?
Wilbur, I've got a job for you.
The rest of you, stay here for a moment.
If we get out...
When. When we get out of here... and you go home, where will that be?
I don't know.
Back to New Jersey, I guess.
Well, I've been thinking.
Maybe you'd like to go back to lowa with me for a while.
Hey, it's a whole lot farther away from the ocean than New Jersey.
This is our only way out.
There is a cargo hatch not too far down.
We swim out and then up to the surface.
Swim underwater? Well, shoot.
Unless you can round up a sea horse for me to ride, you can just count me out.
Wilbur, Celeste, speed it up, will you?
- Wilbur?
- Forget it.
Wilbur, you gotta just hang on now.
We're so close to getting out.
We're all gonna get out if you just hang on.
You just try and keep up with me.
What the hell's keeping them?
Celeste? What the hell is going on in there?
I'm getting my hair done, dummy.
What do you think?
Go ahead. Pick up the gear and take it in there.
- I'll come along in a moment.
- What's taking so long?
Get going. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Come on, go.
It's getting worse, isn't it, old man?
It would get much better if you'd stop calling me old man.
Well, you just stay close to me all the way home.
Is that understood?
You grew up to be one hell of a nice man, you know that?
And you were such a rotten kid.
Now.
- Ready?
- Ready.
None of us are experienced divers, captain.
It's our only way out.
I'm gonna turn you all into frogmen.
No one has a choice.
There should be two more, Wilbur. I counted four between the eight of them.
One is empty.
The one I'm getting is half full.
- Who's gonna get the scubas?
- Everyone.
Last time I went to school three didn't go into eight.
- What did you say?
- Three doesn't go into eight.
With him, it's possible.
You mean Jacques Cousteau never taught you buddy breathing?
- What's buddy breathing?
- More than one diver on a single tank.
Wilbur and I've done it before, so we'll use the least air.
It will be about more than enough in there for the both of us.
- Yeah, then I'll take what's left over.
- Okay.
Gina, you and Meredith are the team on the second tank.
Which leaves Theresa, me and Tex.
Well, you can forget about me.
I'm staying here.
If you get out, why, you can come back and get me.
Not today, Tex.
Listen to me, all of you!
I'm a phony!
A $3 bill!
I haven't got no money.
No oil wells.
And right now, not a hell of a lot of self-respect.
You've all been straight aces with me... and I just didn't want you to find out about it later on.
You worked in the galley on this ship, didn't you, Tex?
That's pretty close.
I'm the assistant wine steward.
That's how come this bottle meant so much to me.
Means more to me than a whole year's salary.
How'd you know, captain?
Even a bloodhound couldn't smell a cold pie in a refrigerator at 100 feet.
You had to know where that kitchen was.
Then why the ruse, Mr. Hopkins?
What was the point of it all?
To survive.
The way I had it figured out, why, the rich always get saved first anywhere.
I just never thought that we'd all wind up like this, down here together.
Well, that's the way we're going out, Tex, together.
Okay, girls, let's get this gear on your back, and I'll show you how to use it.
Don't you think we can go now, doctor?
If I thought so, I would've suggested it.
Our mission is still incomplete.
The one marked Sprague Pumps, bring it up now.
The one last thing to remember is don't panic and you'll be okay.
Okay, Celeste.
Remember the order you go in.
Where's Wilbur?
He's still down there.
I'll get him.
I couldn't find him.
- I'm gonna get the tug. Stay here.
- I'm going with you.
Stay there.
Release that anchor on the back.
Jenny, please don't let me down now.
Here's a rifle. Use it.
They're alive. There they are.
Don't let them get away.
Well, shoot, you idiot!
Shoot! Shoot!
It's jammed. I'm trying.
Shoot, for Pete's sake. Shoot.
Aim at the boxes.
Maybe you'll hit one of them.
- Tex, let me help you.
- I'm okay.
- Oh, my gosh, I shot one of them.
- Well, shoot another one.
Drop back and get the gun.
Come on, Tex. Swim for it.
Faster!
The man in the water.
For you, little lady.
Tex! Tex!
- Let's haul them in.
- Okay.
Poor Wilbur. Why did he do it?
We only had two air tanks left.
He knew we never had a chance... so he gave whatever life he had left.
I really loved that old man.
What are you gonna do now?
Go back to your chateau?
There is no chateau.
Someplace must be home.
I'm open to suggestions.
Well, I'd sign you on the Jenny... but the bank's gonna take the boat away the minute we reach port.
Maybe not.
Gonna kiss me now?
I was gonna kiss you anyway.
How we doing, Richard?
We should pass over the English coast
15 minutes ahead of time, sir.
Well, with this load on our back, that's good going.
Just trust the RAF, sir.
- What the hell is that?
- The shuttle ignition.
Disappeared? And what happened to the Moonraker?
Good God.
Yes, yes, of course, Minister. Right away.
Moneypenny, is 007 back from that African job?
He's on his last leg, sir.
Any higher, Mr. Bond, my ears will pop.
I don't think I'm ever going to fly with anyone else.
You're so right, Mr. Bond.
This is where we leave you, Mr. Bond.
A little premature, isn't it?
Enjoy your flight.
- Good morning, Moneypenny.
- James.
But why are you so late?
I fell out of an airplane without a parachute.
- Who's in there?
- Q and the Minister of Defense.
You don't believe me, do you?
- And you should go right in.
- Yes, Moneypenny.
- 007. At last.
- Good morning, sir.
I think you know Frederick
Gray, Minister of Defense.
- Commander.
- Minister. Q.
Moonraker?
- What do you know about Moonraker?
- What I read in the newspaper, sir.
Then you'll know that
Moonraker, the space shuttle, was being flown over here on loan from the Americans on the back of a 747.
Yes, which crashed somewhere in the Yukon, aircraft and shuttle totally destroyed, correct?
- That's the official version.
- The truth is rather more disturbing, 007.
Look at this.
Now, that's the scene of the crash.
Wreckage strewn over a large area.
That's all that's left of the fuselage.
We've been through it with a fine-toothed comb, but there's no sign of
Moonraker, not a trace.
Are you suggesting the shuttle was hijacked in midair?
That's for you to find out, 007.
The shuttles are built in
California by Drax Industries.
Yes. We were responsible for the safety of that shuttle, Commander.
The United States government is justifiably concerned.
I can imagine. Then, California must be the place to start.
- I agree.
- Don't make any mistakes, 007.
The situation is critical. We've got to find that shuttle.
Yes, sir.
If that's all, gentlemen...
Just a minute, 007. I've got something for you.
Roll up your right sleeve, will you?
This is now being issued as standard equipment.
Strap it on your wrist.
It's activated by nerve impulses from the wrist muscles.
Like this?
Oh, thank you, 007.
- Be careful, will you?
- Yes, Q.
Ten darts, five blue-tipped with armor piercing heads, five red-tipped, cyanide coated, causing death in 30 seconds.
Very novel, Q. You must get them in the stores for Christmas.
Good morning, gentlemen.
- Welcome to California, Mr. Bond.
- I like it already.
My name is Corinne Dufour.
Oh, and you're going to be showing me around, are you, Corinne?
No. I'm just a humble pilot in the service of the Drax Corporation.
This is the Drax estate now. Everything you see belongs to Mr. Drax.
- Owns a lot, doesn't he?
- What he doesn't own, he doesn't want.
We're approaching the main complex now.
That's where the Moonraker shuttle is made?
That's right, workshops, hangars, design and experimental blocks, test centers, everything.
Very impressive.
I'd heard that Hugo Drax is obsessed with the conquest of space.
Now, I can believe it. Good Lord.
The Drax residence. Every stone brought from France.
- Cute, isn't it?
- Magnificent.
Why didn't he buy the Eiffel Tower as well?
He did, but the French government refused him an export permit.
Look there. Those are the astronaut trainees.
Mr. Drax is financing the entire training program out of his own pocket.
He seems to have an eye for a good investment.
Mr. Drax will see Mr. Bond in the drawing room, Miss Dufour.
- Thank you, Cavendish.
- This way, please, sir.
Mr. Bond, sir.
- Mr. Bond.
- Mr. Drax.
Allow me to present, before they leave us, Countess Lubinski,
Lady Victoria Devon, Mr. Bond.
How do you do?
Well, my dear fellow, your reputation precedes you, of course.
I'm honored that your government should send you on so delicate a mission.
Delicate, Mr. Drax?
Well, to apologize in person for the loss of my space shuttle.
How would Oscar Wilde have put it?
"To lose one aircraft may be regarded as a misfortune,"
"to lose two seems like carelessness."
Well, an apology will be made to the American government, Mr. Drax, when we've discovered why there was no trace of the Moonraker in that wreckage.
And your loyalty commands respect, Mr. Bond.
You have arrived at a propitious moment, coincident with your country's one indisputable contribution to Western civilization.
Afternoon tea.
- May I press you to a cucumber sandwich?
- Thank you, no, nothing at all.
The shuttle, is it made entirely here in California?
No. I own a number of subsidiaries throughout the world, producing components.
The conquest of space represents an investment in the future of the entire human race, Mr. Bond.
It is, therefore, logical to seek out the best that each nation has to offer.
- Are you referring to people or skills?
- Both, Mr. Bond.
- Am I too soon?
- Not at all.
I'm sure Mr. Bond is eager to start his tour.
Miss Dufour will escort you to
Dr. Goodhead who will show you around.
Ask anything you like.
- Thank you for being so cooperative.
- A pleasure.
Look after Mr. Bond. See that some harm comes to him.
You'll find Dr. Goodhead first on the right.
- Oh. Thank you for the ride.
- Call on me if you need anything.
Good afternoon.
- Can I help you?
- Yes. My name is Bond.
James Bond. I'm looking for Dr. Goodhead.
- You just found her.
- A woman.
Your powers of observation do you credit, Mr. Bond.
James, to my friends.
Holly Goodhead.
- Are you training to be an astronaut?
- I'm fully trained.
On loan from NASA, the
Space Administration.
Well, Mr. Bond, I guess we'd better get started.
You don't want to lose time as well as a space shuttle, do you?
This is it, the Moonraker.
Capable of being launched into space by rocket...
Orbiting the Earth and reentering the atmosphere to land like any conventional aircraft.
This is the centrifuge training.
It simulates the gravity force you feel when shot into space.
The speed is controlled by the instructor from up there.
Why not try it?
Why not?
- Strap yourself in firmly.
- Yes, Doctor.
Now your arms.
That's to prevent you from knocking yourself out.
I see.
How fast does it go?
It can go up to 20 Gs, but that would be fatal.
Three Gs is equivalent to take-off pressure.
Most people pass out at seven.
You make a great saleswoman.
You don't have to worry. This is what we call a "Chicken Switch."
You just keep your finger on that button, the moment the pressure gets too much for you, release the button
- and the power's cut off.
- Just like that?
Come on, Mr. Bond. A 70- year-old can take 3 Gs.
Well, the trouble is there is never a
70- year-old around when you need one.
- You want me?
- Mr. Drax says to telephone him.
All right, I'll call him from my office.
You go ahead. I'll be right back.
The instructor will supervise the session.
Enjoy yourself.
Yes. We're taking good care of him.
I don't know what could've happened.
Something must've gone wrong with the controls.
Let me help you.
My mother gave me a list of things not to do on a first date.
Maybe you won't need it.
That's not what I came for.
No. What do you want then?
Would your feelings be shattered if I were to say information?
- Why should I tell you anything?
- Why, indeed?
You presume a great deal, Mr. Bond.
What goes on here besides the manufacture of Moonraker?
And the astronaut training program?
There are other laboratories, but not much is happening now.
No?
They were working on something very secret, but everything's been moved.
Where to?
I don't know.
What about that list of your mother's?
I never learned to read.
What are you doing?
You whetted my appetite for information.
Is there a safe in here? Thank you.
James, no.
That's amazing.
There you are, you see?
You have a heart of gold.
Eighteen karat.
You must go.
Well, you go first. I'll turn off the lights.
Thank you.
- Take care of yourself.
- And you.
My dear Bond.
This is Mademoiselle Deladier and La Signorina del Mateo.
- Ladies.
- I'll see you at lunch.
A pity you leave us. Such good sport.
Unless you're a pheasant.
Really, Mr. Bond. Take my gun, a stray bird may fly over.
I only stopped to thank you for your hospitality.
Fraser will get you to the airport in plenty of time.
Come now.
- I doubt if I'm in your class.
- Oh, you're too modest, Mr. Bond.
Over there.
You missed, Mr. Bond.
Did I?
As you said, such good sport.
You called for me, Mr. Drax.
You were with Bond last night in my study.
No, I...
- You showed him the safe.
- I didn't.
I'm terminating your employment.
You will leave immediately.
Franco, I'll call you to tell you where to meet me.
Could I interest you in something?
Why, I'm tempted to say yes immediately.
But I think maybe I'd better have a look around.
Please. Go anywhere you wish.
And in 1955, the Venini
Museum and Glass Works was taken over by Drax Industries.
And here, ladies and gentlemen, we have some of the rarest examples of the glassblower's art.
As you know, everything was done absolutely by hand.
Here is a vase done by Lorenzo Graziati, sometime between 1850 and 1860. If you'd like to follow me over here.
This exquisite bowl was fashioned about 1520, over 450 years ago.
If it ever came on the market, it would certainly fetch a price in excess of one million American dollars.
But if any of you are thinking of taking it...
Now, we have here a very early 17th century dish with an aquamarine medallion.
Over here, we have something very, very interesting.
This glass-handled sword, the only one of its kind in the world, was owned by General Menotti in the late 18th century and is the work of Bruno...
14th century.
Dr. Goodhead.
I can only hope your presence here is a coincidence, Mr. Bond.
- I dislike being spied on.
- Well, don't we all?
You're staying at the Danieli, aren't you?
- Yes. How did you know?
- Well, I like to keep abreast of things.
May I ask what you're doing in Venice?
I'm addressing a seminar of the
European Space Commission.
My, heavy stuff.
But there again, I keep forgetting that you are more than just a very beautiful woman.
If you're trying to be ingratiating,
Mr. Bond, don't bother.
I have more important things on my mind.
That's what I'd like to talk to you about.
- Dinner this evening?
- This evening I'm giving my address.
Well, then, can you think of reason why we don't have a drink afterwards?
Not immediately. But I'm sure I shall.
Franco.
Play it again, Sam.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Convalescing.
Your friend Cha just tried to kill me.
And you think I had something to do with it?
Well, the thought had flashed across my mind.
- What's Drax up to in that laboratory?
- Why don't you ask him yourself?
- You leaving me your telephone number?
- I don't see the point.
Now I do.
Not what I want to get stuck with tonight.
James, why don't you pour yourself a drink?
Thank you.
Daily diary.
Fairly deadly diary.
Bollinger. If it's '69, you were expecting me.
Trifle overpowering, your scent.
Standard CIA equipment.
And the CIA placed you with Drax, correct?
- Very astute of you, James.
- Oh, not really.
I have friends in low places.
Could this possibly be the moment for us to pool our resources?
It could have its compensations.
Where are you planning on going from here?
I'm not planning on going anywhere.
Oh, I suppose you're right, Holly. We would be better off working together.
- Detente?
- Agreed.
- Understanding?
- Possibly.
- Cooperation?
- Maybe.
- Trust?
- Out of the question.
Send the night porter up for my bags immediately, please.
I hope you know what you're doing, Bond.
I've played bridge with this fellow Drax.
007 doesn't usually push the panic button unless it's something serious.
- I should hope not.
- Good morning, Inspector.
- Good morning.
- I see you've covered everything
- with our Italian friends.
- Yes, sir.
- Is this it?
- Yes, sir.
Gas masks?
We can't afford to take any chances, Minister.
Frederick Gray. What a surprise.
And in distinguished company, all wearing gas masks.
You must excuse me, gentlemen, not being English,
I sometimes find your sense of humor rather difficult to follow.
On behalf of the British government, I apologize.
I think you owe us an explanation, 007.
I've never been so humiliated in my life.
Your man should be taken off the assignment.
I'll see you at the consulate.
I'll have to do what he says.
Well, before you do that, sir, have Q do an analysis of this.
I took it from the laboratory.
Tell him to exercise extreme caution.
It is lethal.
So, there was a laboratory.
You better take two weeks leave of absence, 007.
Do have any thoughts about where you might go?
I've always had a hankering to go to Rio, sir.
I think I can recall your mentioning it.
007, no slipups or we're both in trouble.
Yes, a minor crisis has been averted.
No, no, nothing serious, but all merchandise is to be rerouted as from today.
Now, regarding a replacement for Cha, do you have someone in mind?
Oh, yes, well, if you can get him, of course.
Flight BA128 to Rio de Janeiro now boarding, gate number seven.
Welcome to Rio, Mr. Bond.
- The President Suite.
- Really?
Well, don't bother showing me the rest.
If I get lost, I'll take a cab.
- Do you come with the suite?
- It depends who's renting it.
Vodka martini? Shaken not stirred.
Why were you following me from the airport?
I was trying to meet you.
My name is Manuela.
I work for Station VH. We have been asked to assist you.
M thinks of everything.
Tell me, Manuela, do the initials
C and W mean anything to you?
C and W? Yes, Carlos and Wilmsberg.
They are very big importers in Rio.
A subsidiary of the Drax Group, I believe.
They have a warehouse on Carioca Avenue.
I'd like to pay it a discreet visit tonight.
Tonight? I think you may find that a little difficult.
Difficult or not, it's something we have to do.
And meanwhile, how do you kill five hours in Rio if you don't samba?
- There's the warehouse.
- And not a soul about.
- I think there's a way around the back.
- Good thinking.
This is it.
Don't talk to any strange men.
I'll be back.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, but I'd rather dance with you.
I did tell you not to talk to any strange men.
- Did you find anything in there?
- Only this.
"Drax Air Freight."
Do you know which airport they operate from?
Yes. San Pietro. Do you want me to take you there?
No, I think you need some rest.
- Come on. I'll drop you off.
- Okay.
- Haven't we met before somewhere?
- The face is familiar, as is the manner.
It's become distinctly chilly since Venice.
Well, that was before you walked out on me.
Yes, nearly tripping over your suitcase on the way through the door.
So?
So why waste time working against each other?
I've checked Drax's warehouse in town.
It's empty.
That's no surprise. Since I've been here, those planes have been taking off every two hours.
- Yes. He's moving out.
- Where to?
That's what we're going to find out, now that we're working together.
- I still don't know if I trust you.
- I don't know if I trust you either.
That's what makes it more exciting, doesn't it?
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
But I'm sure we're better off out than in.
Bring that chain.
- Hang on, James.
- The thought had occurred to me.
I might have guessed.
- Do you know him?
- Not socially.
His name's Jaws. He kills people.
Here, give me the chain.
Come on. Hang on to me.
Jump.
- Have you broken something?
- Only my tailor's heart.
- What was that for?
- For saving my life.
Remind me to do it more often.
Oh, thank you, but we're in great shape.
Sorry about that.
James! You look as though you've just fallen off a mountain.
Well, it's funny you should say that, Moneypenny.
As a matter of fact, I was in a cable car and...
- Never mind.
- The other courtyard.
- There you are, 007.
- Balls, Q?
Bolas, 007.
- Good. Have that ready for Army Day.
- Yes, sir.
- Where's M?
- He's in the office over there.
This way.
- Good morning, 007.
- Good morning, sir.
- You're just in time. Sit down.
- Thank you, sir.
- Q's come up with something.
- Splendid.
- Any news of Dr. Goodhead?
- Afraid not. Right, Q.
Well, it's a breakdown on that phial of liquid you picked up in Venice.
- You know, you seem to be right, 007.
- Thank you.
It's a highly toxic nerve gas that appears to have no effect on animals.
May I see the formula?
It's a chemical formula of a plant.
Orchideae anegra. A very rare orchid indeed.
Yes. It was thought to be extinct.
Until a missionary brought one back from the upper reaches of the Amazoco.
Well, actually he brought it back from the area of the River Tapirape.
Well done, James. You better get up there and fast.
And I've got something to get him there, if 007 can be trusted to look after it.
Mr. Bond, you defy all my attempts to plan an amusing death for you.
You're not a sportsman, Mr. Bond.
Why did you break off the encounter with my pet python?
I discovered he had a crush on me.
Jaws.

What exactly are you up to here, Drax?
- And why the orchids?
- The curse of a civilization.
It was neither war nor pestilence that wiped out the race who built the great city lying around us.
It was their reverence for this lovely flower.
Because long-term exposure to its pollen caused sterility.
Correct, Mr. Bond.
As you discovered, I have improved upon sterility.
Those same seeds now yield death.
Not, of course, to animals or plant life.
One must preserve the balance of nature.

You delivered a shuttle to the U.S. government, then you hijacked it. Why?
Because I needed it.
One of my own Moonrakers developed a fault during assembly.
Now, you have distracted me enough.
Jaws, Mr. Bond must be cold after his swim.
Place him where he can be assured of warmth.
- Confirmed.

It's all right. We're on a prearranged flight program.
That's Drax in Moonraker Five.
- What about the others?
- I don't know. Let's see.
We're all on parallel courses.
So, we must be headed for a rendezvous in orbit.
Let's see what cargo we have.
- The animals went in two by two.
- What do you mean by that?
Noah's Ark. This operation.
We're converging.
- Control rockets?
- Yes, we're slowing down.
What's that?
There's no image on the radar scanner.
An entire city in space and still nothing on the radar scanner.
- So nobody on Earth knows it's there.
- Right.
Drax must have a radar-jamming system.
All Moonrakers prepare to initiate docking procedures and continue radio silence.
Moonraker Six, you are now in manual.
Initiate docking sequence.
All shuttles now docked. Execute station activation procedure.
Gravity, normal conditions.
Life-support system, nominal.
Moonraker Six technicians, commence operational sequence.
- Sequence four initiated.
- Check airlock seals.
ALS secure.
All personnel to Command satellite.
All personnel to Command satellite.
All crews to M5 segment.
Moonraker Six technicians to M2 segment.
Moonraker One and Three to M1 segment.
Moonraker Four and Five to M4 segment.
Moonraker Two to M5 segment.
Units four and seven, man console as planned.
Units one, three, five and six, assume pre-assigned stations.
- Pressure on-line?
- Confirmed.
- Life support?
- Normal.
Those are the globes I saw in Venice with the nerve gas phials inside.
First there was a dream.
Now there is reality.
Here in the untainted cradle of the heavens will be created a new super-race, a race of perfect physical specimens.
You have been selected as its progenitors, like gods.
Your offspring will return to Earth and shape it in their image.
You have all served in humble capacities in my terrestrial empire.
Your seed, like yourselves, will pay deference to the ultimate dynasty which I alone have created.
From their first day on Earth they will be able to look up and know that there is law and order in the heavens.
All units, start Operation Orchid.
If we were visible from
Earth, they'd investigate.
Where do you suppose that radar-jamming system is?
We didn't pass anything on the way here, so let's try this way.
Station two, check coordinates, mode four.
Initiate globe launch timing sequence.
Orbital communicator, level 10.
Zero gravity.
This is it, the radar-jamming system.
- Coordinate conversion program.
- Check.
- Side lobe gain.
- Check.
- Spectral response.
- Check.
- Spin stabilizer correction factor.
- Okay.
Gigahertz reflector efficiency.
Solar photon screen.
Where did you learn to fight like that? NASA?
No, Vassar.
- Switched off?
- Permanently.
Now we can be spotted from Earth.
- This doesn't look good at all.
- It's over 200 meters in diameter.
Yes, yes.
Will you please listen, General Gogol?
We didn't put it up there.
Neither did we, Colonel Scott.
So what are you suggesting?
We've taken action already. We're sending up a vehicle to intercept.
Very well, but if we don't hear from you in the next 12 hours we take action ourselves and hold you responsible for the consequences.
We'll be in touch, General.
- Sorry to have woken you.
- I was already awake.
How can I sleep? Nothing but problems.
Problems, problems.
Marine astronauts to launch pad.
- Launch pre-program complete, sir.
- Launch globe number one.
T.D.R.S.S. reports a launch, sir.
Continental U.S.A. Vandenberg.
There are no launches scheduled.
Check radar-jamming system.
Well?
Jamming power supply and backup have failed, sir.
- Investigate immediately.
- Investigate number 28, immediately.
James Bond.
You appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season.
I didn't think there were any seasons in space.
As far as you're concerned, only winter.
And the treacherous Dr. Goodhead.
Despite your efforts, my finely wrought dream approaches its fulfillment.
Your dream, whatever sort of nightmare it is, hasn't a chance, Drax.
You think not? We shall see.
We're coming up to second launch position.
Launch globe number two.
No doubt you have realized the splendor of my conception.
First, a necklace of death about the Earth.
50 globes, each releasing its nerve gas over a designated area, each capable of killing 100 million people.
And the human race as you know it will cease to exist.
Then a rebirth, a new world.
U.S. spacecraft on course to intercept us, sir.
Activate laser. Prepare to destroy spacecraft.
You see, my dear Bond, we're well able to protect ourselves against all enemies.
Allow me to introduce you to the airlock chamber.
Observe, Mr. Bond, your route from this world to the next.
And you, Dr. Goodhead.
Your desire to be America's first woman in space will shortly be fulfilled.
Leaving you on your flying stud farm, conceiving your new master race?
If you like, yes.
And of course, anyone not measuring up to your standards of physical perfection
- will be exterminated.
- Certainly.
Interesting.
Most interesting.
Jaws, expel them.
Jaws! You obey me!
Expel them!
Hold them!
Sir, U.S. spacecraft, three minutes to intercept.
Stand by to laser it.
- Initiate firing sequence.
- Initiating.
U.S. spacecraft in laser range, 25.5 and closing.
Range 15.
Range 10.
Prepare to fire. Five, four, three, two...
It's stopped rotating.
Open the cargo doors.
Number one platoon, EVA.
Number one platoon, EVA.
Let's try docking.
Colonel Scott will take the first landing!
Intruders have docked at satellite seven, sir.
Double the guard at every entrance in this satellite.
Report intruders' progress throughout the space station.
Number three globe ready for launching, sir.
Proceed!
Group One, attack enemy.
All units shoot to kill.
- Colonel Scott, don't shoot.
- Hold your fire.
Corridor five penetrated. Intruders advancing on Command satellite.
Maintenance crew needed, section three.
At least I shall have the pleasure of putting you out of my misery.
Desolated, Mr. Bond?
Heartbroken, Mr. Drax.
Allow me.
Take a giant step for mankind.
- Where's Drax?
- He had to fly.
How's Scott doing?
He's got control of the Command satellite.
We put the launching gear for the globes out of action.
When the station breaks up, they'll disintegrate.
They'll harm no one.
But the three that have gone, they'll kill millions.
Those three must be destroyed.
Come on!
Colonel, get your men off as quickly as possible.
Your mission is completed.
Sergeant, round up your men, get them back to the shuttle. Fast!
Back to the shuttle, everybody!
On the double!
Moonraker Five, that's the answer.
Drax's shuttle is armed with a laser.
We can track those globes and destroy them.
It's hopeless, sir. The corridor's blocked.
They can't get to us now.
All right, let's go.
Docking release system is jammed.
Release the door lock. I'll see if I can operate it manually.
It's jammed too.
Well, here's to us.
Jaws, we can't disengage. The docking release system is jammed.
Can you help us?
We're free.
Don't worry, they'll make it.
It's only 100 miles to Earth.
Let's get a read-out on those globes.
I have the three globes on the screen.
We should have a visual in a minute.
There it is.
The laser's on automatic. Code 945 set.
One down, two to go.
Number two straight ahead.
What is it?
We're skipping on the Earth's atmosphere.
In range.
- We should see the last one soon.
- There it is.
- It's getting hot.
- It can't be helped.
I'm coming in at a steeper angle than I should in order to catch that last globe.
I can't hold this course much longer.
We'll break up at 200,000 feet.
Just a few seconds more.
Automatic firing system negative. Must be the heat.
Switching to manual.
Controls aren't responding.
- The wings are beginning to glow.
- Just hold her steady.
Steady.
It's entering Earth's atmosphere!
James, this is our last chance.
Steady.
Colonel Scott reports picking up two survivors from the space station, a tall man and a short blonde woman.
Right. Okay.
Dr. Goodhead reported their position 20 minutes ago.
They're just coming into range of our tracking ship in the Pacific Ocean.
We should have audiovisual within a few minutes from the remote onboard TV monitors.
Houston calling Dr. Goodhead. Houston calling.
Confirm your position.
As this is the first joint venture between our two countries,
I'm having it patched directly to the
White House and Buckingham Palace.
Well, I'm sure Her Majesty will be fascinated.
- We have audiovisual.
- At last.
- My God, what's Bond doing?
I think he's attempting re-entry, sir.
- James?
- I think it may be time to go home.
Take me round the world one more time.
Why not?
[Shaft theme song plays]
[Tires squeal]
SHAFT: Up yours!
DRlVER: Get out of the way!
BOY: Fine time piece, brother?
BOY: Goodbye.
[Shaft theme song continues]
"Who's the black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks?
"Shaft
"Damn right
"Who is the man that would risk his neck for his brother man?
"Shaft
"Can you dig it?
"Who's the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about?
"Shaft
"Right on
"They say this cat is a bad mother
"Shut your mouth
"I'm talking about Shaft
"Then we can dig it
"He's a complicated man
"No one understands him
"But his woman
"John Shaft"
What's happening, Marty?
Same old sixes and sevens, Shaft.
[Stutters] Two guys were looking for you like 10 minutes ago.
Harlem cats?
How the hell should I know?
Everybody looks the same to me.
SHAFT: Take it easy, Marty.
Take care, Shaft.
[Shaft theme song continues]
SHAFT: Thanks, brother.
Too much sugar this morning.
Then don't drink it, baby.
CUL: A couple of dudes from uptown looking for you.
Know them?
Not by name.
Seen them around uptown.
Come in here when I was opening up.
CUL: Asked where they could find you.
What did they look like?
CUL: One was wearing a funky plaid coat.
Other one was sharp.
$50 shoes. Black coat, gray flares.
SHAFT: Is that all?
CUL: They had heat on them.
The one in the plaid coat had his hands in his pocket.
CUL: Pulled his coat tight, you dig?
Had some heavy iron in his belt.
You got a scuff on the toe of this left shoe.
VlC: What time you got, Tom?
TOM: 8:16.
Pull over in front of that shoe-shine parlor.
He usually hangs out there.
TOM: Okay.
TOM: You want me to go in?
VlC: No. We'll wait.
Got yourself a nice shine. You can go out and make something of yourself, man.
Go out and get rich and fat like you?
We're straight, baby.
VlC: Got a minute, Shaft?
Got no use for no dirty postcards, Vic.
Get off my back.
I just want to talk to you.
Call me up. You know my number.
Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
Go sit in the park a minute?
Hell, no. Just tell me what you got to say right here!
Tom, go get us two cigars.
What kind do you smoke?
Just say what you've got to say.
Get us a couple of El Garcia's.
Look, I'm late.
What are you trying to lay on me?
Just love, Shaft.
Nothing but love and sympathy.
Then we're even. Go on, get on with it.
I thought you might know something
I want to know.
Seems there's been a lot of low, quiet rumbles going on uptown.
Our people have been able to pick up the sounds of it, but not words.
That's 'cause us black folk talk mush mouth, Lieutenant.
I thought we'd get to it.
We did. But, you want me to pigeon.
I just said, "Up yours, baby."
How come two cats from Harlem came downtown this morning...
...Iooking for John Shaft?
They're soul brothers. They came down so I could teach them the handshake.
They find you?
Of course, I wasn't hiding.
If you find out anything, give me a call.
I'm still at the 38th Precinct.
Right on.
Where the hell are you going?
To get laid. Where the hell are you going?
[Shaft laughs loudly]
That boy's got a lot of mouth on him.
The boy's man enough to back it up, too.
What did he tell you?
Nothing.
Got to lean on that kind.
You don't lean on that kind.
Give me a package of gum.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Make a noise, I'll cut you. Back up.
JlM: Something wrong, Mr. Shaft?
SHAFT: Sick friend here.
SHAFT: Jim, can you get us a car up?
SHAFT: I'll take that.
Now, be cool, man.
Where is your partner?
SHAFT: Open the door.
[Passersby scream]
SHAFT: You've got about a half a minute to tell me what the hell you want with me.
The police will ask why you threw that son of a bitch out the window.
They can find you dead or alive.
Now, what's your goddamn story?
Bumpy....
Bumpy says to bring you uptown.
Did he tell you to mess me up?
I was to bring you.
[Sirens blare]
It doesn't make sense.
You arrive at your office.
You have a sick friend with you.
Suddenly, another man you don't know rushes up and a fight starts.
Your sick friend goes out the window.
Why, Mr. Shaft?
Ask the man who started the fight,
Mr. Leibowitz.
Your friend, the only name you know him by is "Tex"?
BYRON: No last name?
SHAFT: That's right.
I don't buy that, Shaft.
I think you know more than that.
Why the fight started, for instance.
What you think and what you can prove are two different bags.
All your friends walk around with weapons like that?
That depends.
My Negro friends don't walk around with rabbits' feet no more.
Don't get wise with me.
There's a simple way for me to go.
-I'll put your goddamn ass in!
-I'll sue your goddamn ass for false arrest.
You want me to believe the man fell out the way you said he did?
-What do I look like? Some kind of klutz?
-Don't ask, and I won't tell you.
BYRON: You're licensed by the city and the state.
No one licensed can afford to be a wise ass where a felony case is involved.
Are you suggesting I'd lose my license?
You are damn right I am!
You better believe it and level with me!
Threatening my livelihood is a violation of my rights, isn't it?
Byron....
VlC: Let me have a talk with him in private.
You got an assailant to interview.
Start that and I'll join after we talk.
I think you are b.s.-ing me, too.
This thing stinks.
Maybe he didn't like the handshake you taught him.
You know you can get your rump in a sling for this mess?
-Static, a lot of hassle.
-You'll save me, Vic.
Well, I can try.
If?
One hand washes the other.
All the hassle in the world wouldn't make me sing a song to the police.
No way, baby.
That cat you threw out the window was a flunky for Bumpy Jonas.
I didn't throw no cat out no window, Lieutenant.
VlC: Bumpy isn't gonna like it.
I don't care what he likes!
What the hell are you pumping me for?
Two weeks ago we started picking up rumbles.
-You already said that.
-We know it's not the Panthers.
Or the Young Lords.
But, something's on the boil.
VlC: I want to know what it is...
...before we need an adding machine to count the bodies.
VlC: Bumpy wants you for something.
He knows what's going on.
And that's what I want to know.
Not who, just what.
It warms my black heart to see you so concerned about us minority folks.
Come on, Shaft.
What is it with this black shit?
You ain't so black.
And you ain't so white, baby.
All right.
You want to play your super heavy black number.
I'm gonna play mine.
We can nail your tail for manslaughter with what we've got on you right now!
You can waltz Leibowitz, but you know the law. You could be charged.
Charged, Lieutenant.
VlC: Yeah, but your license'll be suspended.
You'll be out of business for six months.
You want to be out of business for six months?
VlC: Out on the street.
No gun permit. Six months!
With Bumpy looking for you when all hell's about to break loose?
You want it, you got it.
You scare me to death, Lieutenant.
VlC: You're buying trouble not only for yourself, but a blood bath up in Harlem.
You want that?
All I'm asking you is to let me know what's going on!
No names, no places, just what!
I'm not asking you to sell out.
Tell me the name of the game, so I know the rules.
I'll think about it.
All right, I'll settle for that now.
That buys you 48 hours on the street, and then we're gonna talk again.
You got the number of Bumpy's private phone?
[Murmurs in agreement]
All right.
Take off. I'll see to Leibowitz.
Right on.
I'll see you.
Look at that.
[Slow instrumental beat]
[Phone rings]
-Wrong number.
-Don't bull me, I got the right number.
This is Shaft.
How did you get this number?
Off a bathroom wall in the goddamn subway.
I'm looking for you.
I've got an office.
Here you are.
VENDOR: Thanks.
SHAFT: Bag of chestnuts, please.
Cold as hell today, huh?
Yeah, yeah. Good chestnuts.
SHAFT: How much?
VENDOR: Two bits.
SHAFT: Here you go. Take it easy.
VENDOR: Thanks.
Hey, taxi!
SHAFT: What the hell is this?
You white mother!
SHAFT: Taxi! Taxi!
WlLLY: Cat say he gonna be here, he should be here.
BUMPY: Open it up.
Cat say he gonna be here...
...and he ain't.
It ain't right, Boss.
BUMPY: We'll wait.
WlLLY: You take crap off of him...
...he'll give you more crap.
We'll wait.
That's some cold shit...
...throwing my man, Leroy, out the window.
Just picked my man up, and threw him out the goddamned window.
Got us standing around and waiting to say thank you.
SHAFT: Glad you let yourself in, Bumpy.
Give me a bad name, have you hanging around in the hall.
Look....
If the man ever comes down here...
...again to see you...
...you make sure you be here.
Waiting.
SHAFT: You're in my chair.
BUMPY: Wait outside.
Sims and Leroy tried to muscle you, Shaft?
Yup.
Well, I got no grudge about Leroy.
I couldn't give a damn.
I got a job for you.
I'm not on the hustle, Bumpy.
A detective job.
-What kind?
-Your kind. You take it.
Don't jive me. What are you talking about?
BUMPY: Somebody kidnapped my daughter, Marcy.
Done in a couple of people.
Didn't leave no ransom note or nothing.
Nobody saw nothing.
I want you to find her.
That's the fucking job.
[Siren blares]
The police do that for free.
Not for me. You know I can't go to the cops.
And you want me?
The spade detective.
Yeah, I want you 'cause you're a black spade detective.
I want you 'cause you got your other foot in whitey's trough! She can be anywhere.
Got any idea who grabbed her?
A lot of cats hate my guts.
A sweet, loving dude like you?
Sweet talking a man's lady...
...as you beat her man out of his paycheck in the back room of a horse parlor?
Feeding his kid shit to shoot in his arm?
Who could hate you, Bumpy?
My baby never sold nothing to nobody.
Never took nothing from nobody.
She's a straight kid.
She's going to college.
Whoever grabbed her, got her to get at me.
They have a beef with me, they should come to me.
So you got a rule that somebody else don't.
Is that all you know?
There's a piece of Harlem I can't get at.
The one them militants got their arm on.
BUMPY: They could have my baby.
She's been into some of that stuff.
Bunch calls themselves the "La Mumba's."
Ben Buford's thing.
I could send my people to ask them.
Shit.
It'd come to a shootout and when it's all over, a bunch of dead cats.
And maybe they'd kill Marcy.
Yeah, you're Papa pimp to them.
They want to see you burn as bad as they want to see the police burn.
But kidnapping sisters, that ain't their thing.
BUMPY: The only reason anybody grabs anybody for is money.
What other bunch in Harlem needs money bad enough to grab my baby?
If you believe that, what's all this about me having a foot in whitey's trough?
BUMPY: I said I think they had her.
I didn't say they had her in Harlem.
They ain't dumb enough to take her someplace uptown.
It don't lay right.
What the hell you think I need you for if I knew who had her?
I'm guessing.
If they don't have her, all right.
Maybe they know something.
I got nothing.
That's the job, Shaft.
Will you take it, or no?
I get $50 an hour.
Plus expenses.
And no questions asked about how I spend it.
You got it.
I get a free hand to move any way I want.
[Sobs] You find my baby.
That's all I want.
I got money.
You spend it.
And you find her.
That'll get you started.
[Sentimental instrumental music]
When will I hear from you?
When I got something to say.
One more thing:
You send another cat after me with a gun,
I'll kill him and I'll come looking for you!
And I'll get you, Bumpy.
You believe it.
[Door closes]
Fake mother.
[Blues song plays]
"Black man born free "
SHAFT: You seen Ben Buford around?
"The way it's supposed to be
"Chains that bind him are hard to see
"Unless you take this walk with me
"The place where he lives
"It's got plenty of names
'Slums"'
Ben Buford used to live here.
He live here anymore?
No, why?
I'm looking for him.
I am, too. He owes me six months' rent.
SHAFT: Take it easy.
[Blues song continues]
"Any kind of job is hard to find
"And that means an increase in the welfare line
"Crime rate is rising too
"If you are hungry, what would you do?
"Rent is two months past due
"And the building is falling apart
"Little boy who needs a pair of shoes "
Hello, ma'am. I'm looking for a guy named Ben Buford. You know him?
Yeah, I know him.
-Seen him around here lately?
-Not in a long while.
"Some of the brothers got plenty of cash
"Chicks on the corner gonna see to that
"Some like to smoke, some like to blow
"Some even strung out on a $50 jones
"Some are trying to ditch reality
"By getting so, so high
"Only to find out that you can never touch the sky"
I'm looking for Ben Buford.
You seen him around?
No, I ain't seen him.
Thanks.
Know what the number was today?
"Every Sunday morning
"I can hear the old sisters say
"Hallelujah, hallelujah
"Trust in the Lord

"I hope that he hears their prayers
"'Cause deep in their souls they believe

"Soulsville "
SHAFT: What's happening?
BUNKY: Man, how's it going?
Seen Ben?
Ben? Ben who?
Ben Buford. You know who I mean.
Look, man, I don't know no Ben Buford.
That Ben Buford.
He's holed up on a place on Amsterdam, 71 0.
What apartment and what time?
Third floor. There's a meeting at 9:00.
BUNKY: I can't guarantee it.
I just heard some cat tell another cat.
They're both in the movement with Ben.
Yeah, well, stay loose, baby.
[Soft instrumental music]
You all right?
Baby, are you all right?
I got to feeling like a machine.
That's no way to feel.
Come here, baby.
[Ellie groans]
Had a visitor from uptown this afternoon.
What're you having?
A dog with mustard and onions.
VlC: No.
Hold the onions.
Cold, huh?
Well, John, what did you get?
I got laid.
Uptown, brother. Amsterdam Avenue.
Take your time. I'm early.
[Upbeat instrumental music]
Champ, you lost?
No.
You live around here?
Yeah.
You look cold.
Get something to eat.
Gee, thanks, mister.
Okay, champ.
[Slow, suspenseful instrumental music]
[Woman laughing]
['70s rock song plays on radio]
[Background conversations]
[Knock on door]
-Who is it?
-John Shaft, Ben.
Unless you want more visitors, better split up that pair out front.
Put somebody on the basement door.
How did you find me?
Wasn't hard. You got a big mouth.
-Cool it, man.
-You cool it, boy.
Don't let your mouth get your ass in trouble.
BEN: I got nothing to say to you.
SHAFT: Don't jive me.
-We've put in a lot of street time together.
-That was a long time back.
I don't know you no more.
A lot of hard years, man.
The kind you don't forget.
Now, I'm gonna give you one minute to say what you came here to say.
Then you go back out that door you came in or I'll throw you out.
You know Marcy Jonas?
-Yeah, why?
-You know where she is?
-What do you mean?
-Somebody grabbed her.
Bumpy thinks maybe it was you.
We don't do that kind of thing.
You know anything about it?
Tom, you used up your minute. Get out!
Don't "Tom" me, man!
[Machine-gun fire]
SHAFT: Where are the guns?
BEN: None here.
[Woman screams]
SHAFT: I'll be goddamned!
Sonny! Sonny!
BEN: They're coming!
DOTTS: Up on the roof?
BEN: Yeah. Go!
He's dead.
SHAFT: Come on, come on!
SHAFT: Not the roof, this way!
[Baby cries]
SHAFT: Stand back.
OLD LADY: What is this?
SHAFT: Everything will be fine.
-What is this?
-Go over there and be quiet.
[Dog barks in distance]
SHAFT: Everything's okay, ma'am.
No need to worry.
Sorry about your door.
SHAFT: That'll take care of it.
BEN: You set us up, man!
OLD LADY: Young man, please.
Don't do that.
Don't ever threaten me again!
And don't call me Judas!
SHAFT: Come on. It's no time to count your dead. Come on!
Look.
[Woman gasps and screams]
SHAFT: Come on!
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
SHAFT: This way, this way!
SHAFT: One of yours?
BEN: No.
SHAFT: Probably a finger man.
SHAFT: When you lead that revolution, whitey better be standing still...
...'cause you don't run worth a damn no more!
BEN: We're done running, man.
SHAFT: What the hell do you call this, man?
[Sirens blare]
I got to find out if they're after you or me.
[Suspenseful instrumental music continues]
I'll leave you with some friends.
They're straight people.
So don't you lay any of that Uncle Tom jive on them.
VlC: I don't know what's connected to what. I can't piece them together.
[Phone rings]
Answer that.
VlC: It's only a half an hour since it happened.
How could I have something this soon?
TOM: He's on the other line.
VlC: I'm not paid enough to worry...
...about what the Commissioner or the Mayor thinks!
It's Shaft. You want to talk to him?
I got a call. I might have something.
Hold on.
No, better I call you back.
I'm coming to see you.
You've been holding out on me.
I'll wait. Listen, several cats were killed in Harlem.
VlC: You know anything about it?
I was there, Lieutenant.
The Captain's at home. Call him back.
Tell him I left to chase down a lead.
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere. Just get him off my back.
A reporter from the News wants an interview.
Tell him to call the Captain.
Serves the old bastard right.
TOM: This is that list from the intelligence section.
VlC: What about the pictures?
TOM: They're getting them together now.
Said about five minutes.
Shaft's coming down. Send him right in.
Dina'll get you a bed made up.
Why don't you get some sleep, man?
Got some dead brothers laying out there.
And this ain't where I should be.
Till we find out why they're dead, this is the only place for you to be!
You think like a white man!
You don't think! You want to get wasted?
If that's what it takes!
DlNA: Marvin's sleeping.
I'll find out what I can and pick you up in the morning.
If you think I'll owe you for this, you're wrong.
You got nothing I want!
DlNA: You can have the girls' room.
I got to go out. Got an extra key so I don't wake you when I come back?
This'll open the downstairs door, too.
Watch your mouth.
I'll say anything I want.
Not in this house. Not here, you won't.
[Shaft chuckles]
Have a chair.
I don't like your chair.
You gave me nothing, Vic.
You want to lock me up for manslaughter
'cause someone went out of my window...
...go ahead.
SHAFT: You got no deal.
VlC: I have nothing else to give you, then.
That's straight.
What do you got now?
One question first.
Anyone who could've identified those guys with machine guns got wiped out!
Yeah?
Five of Ben Buford's people and probably the guy that fingered you.
Me? Are you sure it's me?
I'd be sure if I knew if the guys were black or white.
I'd make it 80-20 they were after you.
But Bumpy could probably tell you that for sure.
Just say what you got, man.
A few things that may fit.
Do you remember I told you that Bumpy was doubling his crews up in Harlem?
So?
VlC: So, downtown we get some visitors.
Three guys from LA, two from Phoenix, a guy from Decatur, lllinois...
...four guys from Philly.
Altogether about 15 that we're sure of.
Special guys, huh?
VlC: All suspected being guns for the Mafia.
Just got into town.
Most of them staying at a hotel in the Village. Taking in the sights.
Is that it?
No, one thing more.
A couple of dudes from Harlem go across to Jersey.
Try to kidnap some Mafia bigwig.
They blew it.
VlC: They killed the guy's runner.
But the man says his runner was in Florida on a fishing trip.
SHAFT: Looks like war coming.
VlC: It's a bad thing.
Mafia against Bumpy.
It's hood against hood, on the inside.
On the outside, it's black against white.
We could have tanks and troops on Broadway if this thing breaks open.
Yeah, you got a point.
This is what some of our visitors look like.
SHAFT: Be a good time for it.
VlC: What? War?
SHAFT: [Chuckles] Fishing down in Florida.
VlC: It might help if I knew what Bumpy hired you for.
-Never said he did.
-He did.
It's against my ethics to say yes or no.
-He put you on the spot, Shaft.
-He did?
You're a very wise Caucasian, Vic.
I'll be here. If I'm not, call me at home.
That's a comfort.
[Phone rings]
DlNA: Hello?
SHAFT: Hello, baby.
[Sighs] I waited up.
-Sorry, I can't make it.
-Got problems?
Yeah, I got a couple of them.
I was born black and I was born poor.
[Ellie laughs]
I love you.
Yeah, I know.
Take it easy.
Hey....
SHAFT: Get up.
We've got a man to see.
Yeah.
[Slow instrumental music]
[Banging on door]
See who that is, will you?
SlMS: It's Shaft.
Let him in.
-I have an appointment with Bumpy.
-I know all about it.
I've got to see if you're clean before you can see the man.
Better get yourself six more helpers then.
That's how it's done.
Who searches you?
Nobody.
Then get the same cat to search us.
I've got to see if you got a gun on you before you go in.
Tell Bumpy we were here. Come on, Ben.
SlMS: You gonna let them walk now, Willy?
Bumpy'll have your tail.
WlLLY: Wait here, I'll call in to the man.
BUMPY: What do you want, Willy?
WlLLY: Shaft's out here with some dude.
BUMPY: Send them in.
He won't let me see if they are clean.
BUMPY: Let them in.
Go on, you heard him.
Listen, Snow White...
...we're gonna tangle sooner or later.
Did you hear what I said?
Why don't you stop playing with yourself?
You ain't gonna do shit!
[Buzzer sounds]
You're a cagey spook, Bumpy.
You ride a tall horse, Mr. Shaft.
This is Ben Buford. Your little caper cost him five friends last night.
-We'll take it out of your ass, pimp.
-You're pushing me a little far.
I found out some things, Bumpy.
You knew who grabbed your daughter, and that it wasn't Ben or his people...
...when you laid all that jive on me in my office.
I told you, there was no note.
I still don't know who has her.
SHAFT: You're lying, man!
Now, deal them up straight, or don't deal them at all!
You grabbed the dope hustle up here from the Mafia.
BEN: Made yourself some big bread.
Now the Mafia wants to move in on you.
So what?
So, the Mafia grabbed your daughter.
SHAFT: You knew it.
You knew it when you hired me.
Yeah.
You tried to snatch one for a trade.
But your flunky friends out there blew it.
They burned some kid. Missed the man we wanted to grab for a trade.
Then you wanted to hustle old Shaft.
I hired you for a job. I conned you, but I never lied to you.
BUMPY: My baby was grabbed.
You'll get her back. You bought that deal.
You're gonna live with it.
Not at these prices, baby.
[Bumpy chuckles]
BUMPY: I told you what it costs, it costs.
A lot of hyped-up black people give you that money you're spending, pimp!
Don't you try to bullshit me, boy.
We're all on the hustle.
I sell broads and dope and numbers.
You sell crap and blue sky.
It's all the same game.
SHAFT: You knew the Mafia cats would come after me, didn't you?
But it doesn't shake me up.
They made a good move to take out my front man.
They'll probably try again. I would.
You been using me, Bumpy. Suckered me.
That's okay. We stood face to face.
But, I want to know why you wanted me to hook up with Ben.
'Cause you're gonna need an army to get my baby back.
Ben's got one.
BUMPY: My people ain't worth a damn outside of Harlem.
If you think I'd risk some of the brothers...
...just 'cause your daughter's black, you're wrong, man.
We need money.
I got a lot of brothers and sisters in jail.
Set a price.
$10,000 a head.
That's what the honky government pays a cat in the Army for insurance.
$10,000 a man.
That's our price.
All right.
You telling me you're willing to lay out that kind of bread for Marcy?
Don't jive me, man.
I can always get more money.
I only got one baby.
SHAFT: That means you already owe him
$50,000 for the men he lost last night.
All right.
We can get a lot of brothers and sisters out of jail with that.
How many of his you'll need?
Depends on whether the Mafia will take a ransom.
-They want Harlem, nothing less.
-lt ain't yours to give. Not anymore.
Mine or not, it's not gonna be theirs.
SHAFT: All I gotta do is find out where they've got her and bring her home.
That's it.
If he's worth $10,000, I'm worth $20,000.
You got it, COD.
Half now, half when I bring her home.
BEN: All!
Right now!
Half, that's the best I'll do.
SHAFT: You just been hustled, Bumpy.
Deliver the money tonight.
I'll have my boys drop it off.
At these prices, you blow it, Shaft,
I'm not gonna like it.
Not even a little bit.
I thought the money didn't matter to you.
Just getting your baby back.
Money always matters.
This is where I get off, man.
One thing we got to get straight.
If it comes to a fight, we do it my way.
For that kind of bread, the brothers'll play.
As long as you remember we owe them five.
I said, my way!
I'll call you.
BlLLY: Hey, man!
SHAFT: Hey, Billy? Come here.
-Do me a favor.
-Sure.
-Go up to my place and turn on the--
-Hey, no, man. I've already turned on.
No, Billy, turn on the lights.
Lights.
-About two minutes, okay?
-Got it.
[Soul music plays]
ROLLlE: How are we doing, love?
That's nice. Don't make any trouble.
-Johnny!
-What do you say, Rollie?
Gorgeous coat!
How about letting me take over the bar for a while?
There's nothing I wouldn't do for $20.
Have funzies.
You look ready.
Yeah, okay. Scotch and water, both.
On the house, gents.
And since the house is buying,
I'll have one.
To the big-hearted owner of the No Name Bar.
Whether he knows he's generous or not.
[Shaft chuckles]
That's all booze!
Right on.
All booze. One zillion percent.
[Phone rings]
Hello?
SHAFT: Hold on.
Hold on.
No, he ain't here. Right.
ROLLlE: Ho there, innkeeper?
ROLLlE: Two gin and tonics, and a Virgin Mary...
...for moi.
I'm thirsty. Parched.
ROLLlE: There's a girl over there...
...with the dark hair and the groovy boobs....
ROLLlE: You really turn her on, if you're interested.
I ain't dead.
Her friend, Valerie, says she's hot for my body. I told her I was gay.
You know what she said?
She'd straighten me out.
ROLLlE: That's what she said.
It's not enough that I'm lovely, she wants me to play character parts.
The one with the titillating boobs is named Linda.
Man can't walk on one leg.
Hate drinking alone.
[Phone rings]
Vic, private line.
SHAFT: Hey, sweet baby?
This is your lover man.
Who the hell is this?
Two sweet guesses.
That you, Shaft?
You bet your lovely self it is.
And I'm ready. Can you dig it?
Got troubles?
-I got what you want.
-Where are you?
No Name Bar in the Village.
SHAFT: On Jane Street.
-What do you want me to do?
-Haul your beautiful self down here.
How many are there?
About two.
I'll close up and we'll go over to my pad.
You walk in that front door,
I'll close up right now.
-I'll have a car there in a few seconds.
-That's what I want to hear.
A lot of loose stuff around here?
All a man can handle, deacon.
What are you looking at?
Get lost.
Go do something.
Where are my manners?
I didn't even introduce myself to you gentlemen.
My name is John Shaft.
Freeze!
[Woman screams]
POLlCEMAN: Throw me a towel.
SHAFT: There's two of them.
We're generous around here.
[Soft instrumental music]
It's not so bad.
It's a nice pad you got here.
I'm going upstairs to take a shower.
I'll be right back.
I just couldn't wait.
SHAFT: What do you say, Vic?
VlC: 'Morning.
Both of them had guns, licenses to carry them.
VlC: "Jewelry couriers," the licenses say.
Detroit people.
SHAFT: Will you turn them loose?
VlC: I have no choice.
They'll leave town.
You'll have strangers looking for you, not them.
Can I have a private talk with them?
What you'll do to poor Carmen now?
Give him cancer?
You busted his head, settle.
I want to find out his views on urban renewal.
All right.
Tom....
I'm speaking for Bumpy Jonas.
SHAFT: He wants to be sure his daughter's okay.
My word is all he'll take.
No phone calls and no letters from her.
I've got to see her.
Then maybe he'll deal.
Nothing I want to say in this rat hole.
PATSY: People might be listening.
SHAFT: That's a risk we'll have to take.
SHAFT: Now give me a number so I can let you know where I'll be.
I'll call you at 12:30 sharp!
And meet you at 12:45 somewhere in the Village.
[Slow instrumental music]
Hey, baby?
LlNDA: Come here.
SHAFT: Party's over.
SHAFT: You got to split.
Some other time.
Same feeling, same place.
Right now I've got to take care of some business.
MAN: Yeah?
Put Ben on.
MAN: He's asleep, who wants him?
Wake him up, it's John Shaft.
You're really great in the sack, but...
...you're pretty shitty afterwards.
Yeah?
I'm trying to take care of some business.
BEN: Come on!
Ben.
I need two good men. Are you ready?
BEN: Yeah.
They'd better be tough.
Baby, please close the door.
Close it yourself, Shitty.
-Tell me where and when.
-At Café Reggio in the Village.
-Know where it is?
-I'll find it.
I'll be there. 'Bye.
[Knock on door]
Yeah?
It's Vic Androzzi.
SHAFT: What the hell are you doing here?
SHAFT: I got no time for chats.
You had time for a chat with Carmen and Patsy in my office this morning.
You got me in one hell of a mess.
SHAFT: Did you have the room bugged?
VlC: No, not me.
VlC: Me? I could turn the other way.
Not hear what I heard.
It's that big-eared Captain I got who was listening.
He thinks he heard you discussing a kidnapping.
He thinks the Mafia's involved.
And he knows Bumpy Jonas is involved.
Tell him to ask Bumpy then.
Yeah, I did.
VlC: But he wants to ask you.
Now. At the station.
Lousy timing, right?
Gonna take me in?
I will if I find you.
Are you home?
Hell, no.
That's too bad.
Call me when you get home.
I will.
"Close it yourself, Shitty."
[Vic laughs loudly]
This is Shaft. Now get this straight!
I'll be at Café Reggio on McDougall street at 12:45.
SHAFT: Got it?
MAN: Reggio, 12:45.
Right.
[Soft instrumental music plays]
Menu?
Espresso.
Don't you want a sandwich or something with it?
Just espresso.
I hope you don't like lemon peel.
Let it go.
I think you like it. I'll go get you some.
I always forget the lemon peel.
I'm looking for a nigger named John Shaft.
You just found him, wop!
Sit down.
I have to take you to visit a lady.
Come on.
I haven't finished my espresso.
Why don't you have some?
Maybe they'll put a little garlic in it, if you're nice.
No, thanks. But you go ahead.
We've even got time for you to have your soul food.
Espresso?
No, thanks.
Keep it.
Thanks, baby.
Let's go.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
BEN: Come on.
SHAFT: After you, man.
You stay here.
You get around the back, keep an eye on the alley door. Stay out of sight.
What if they come out our way?
You follow them. Remmy, you come back for me. Now move it!
SHAFT: [Whispers] No noise.
Now, answer me straight.
No lies and no con.
How many men you got in there with her?
Two.
SHAFT: Okay.
When I tell you, you open that door like this gun was about to blow your head off.
No signal or you're gone. Got it?
Yeah.
DOM: Gin!
Open it.
[Marcy gasps]
Turn her loose or he goes.
SHAFT: Tell them to turn her loose.
CHARLlE: He won't.
He won't shoot, Marcy, come here.
CHARLlE: There's nothing you can do, Shaft.
Except go back to Harlem and tell Bumpy his little girl is fine.
-When I leave, she leaves with me.
-No way, Shaft.
She's our ace. You never give up your ace.
SHAFT: Maybe you're right.
I should take you uptown and turn you over to Bumpy.
Change your mind, you can walk right now.
You try to take the girl or me along, you're dead.
You trying to tell me they'd blow you away to get me?
That's right.
[Marcy whimpers]
I halfway believe you. But, you're my ace, so I got to call you.
[Marcy sobs]
LEE: The only thing that's keeping you alive right now is...
...you got to be fit enough to go tell that black punk in Harlem...
...that he's got 24 hours to deal or he's got a dead daughter!
LEE: And a war!
You hear me?
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!
[Dramatic instrumental music]
LEE: Back door.
[Marcy sobs]
LEE: Come on.
LEE: Come on!
You all right? Come on.
Come on.
You all right?
SHAFT: Get me up out of here.
The place'll be stinking with cops in a minute.
BEN: Grab those guns.
Let's get out of here.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Banging on door]
BEN: Ellie! Ellie, open up!
ELLlE: Yes!
My God! What happened?
BEN: He's been shot.
ELLlE: Put him on the couch.
BEN: Didn't want to tell you on the phone.
SHAFT: Ellie, call Sam.
ELLlE: You need a real doctor, baby.
SHAFT: I said, call Sam.
Easy.
[Shaft groans]
Blade.
Get on the phone.
We gonna need some more brothers.
With guns this time.
Bumpy'll handle the transportation.
Had to bring you to, Johnny.
Can't fix anything else, till you tell me where you hurt.
Wall to wall, Sam.
Ellie, give me that phone.
-Get those boys?
-Got eight.
Know where they took her?
One of the brothers tailed them.
He's watching the place now.
What about the back exit?
Everything's cool, baby. Don't worry.
Did you run into a train?
Tight as you can get it.
I got to get up soon as you're done.
[Shaft groans]
Damn, those were some tough white boys.
You're gonna have one hell of a time.
Got a bad sprain on that right wrist.
Tape it.
I did, damn it. What do you think I am, an amateur?
Too good of a job, Sam.
I didn't even feel it.
BUMPY: Wrong number.
Cut the crap, man. This is Shaft.
I saw Marcy.
Is she all right?
SHAFT: Scared to death, but okay.
I need three cabs, on the corner of Ninth and Washington.
-To pick up some of Ben's people.
-How soon?
Now, man, now!
[Phone clicks]
BROTHER 1 : Okay, you two! Outside!
Move, move!
Let's go!
Tie them up!
All right, where are the uniforms?
SHAFT: Who's that?
TULLY: The night janitor. He's okay.
Use him to find out which room they got her in.
SHAFT: Getting it together?
BROTHER 1 : Yeah, right on.
VlC: Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
BEN: Jerry, how are you doing, baby?
Hey, boy?
Send up two coffees and a Coke.
Glass or a straw?
For the Coke.
Make it a straw.
Straw?
You heard me, straw.
BEN: Right.
BROTHER 2: You're a shrewd cat, Shaft.
SHAFT: You and your boys blow it and I'll be one dead cat!
You all know the plan. No mistakes.
Let's go.
[Door closes]
[Slow, dramatic instrumental music]
There you are, sir.
Two coffees, a Coke and a straw.
-Want me to take it in?
-Whoa.
Right.
Hey, thank you!
-I'll be seeing you.
-Okay.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Elevator buzzer sounds]
Shut up!
-What do you guys want?
-Your coat.
SHAFT: Rope and harness.
SHAFT: Go ahead down.
[Bang]
Did you hear anything?
No.
[Suspenseful instrumental music continues]
This damn thing won't burn hot enough.
You got something else in there that'll burn?
It's gin, man.
What else you got?
MAL: Gasoline.
Come on!
[Metal squeaks]
Give me a cigarette.
SHAFT: You know what to do?
MAL: Yeah.
[Loud, suspenseful instrumental music]
BROTHER: Let's get out of here!
BROTHER: Come on!
Let's go!
[Sirens blare]
VlC: Androzzi, here.
Vic, your case just busted wide open.
VlC: So close it for me.
Cut the crap, man. This is Shaft.
"You'll have to close it yourself, Shitty! "
[Shaft laughs loudly]
[Shaft theme song plays]
SDH subtitles conformed by
SOFTlTLER
There's a Mustang '66.
We could turn that into a '65 with no trouble.
There's a Volkswagen.
Hey.
Hey, let's do a dune buggy!
Hey, no foreign cars, huh, man?
There's a Chrysler imperial.
Look at the fins.
You like it?
I love it.
Yeah.
No way.
O.K., keep your eyes peeled for a Packard.
You guys want to do a Camaro?
Whoa.
Don't get me wrong.
I got nothing against Ford products.
Climb under and tell me if that cross member's straight.
Come on. Cut that out.
Yeah, it's straight,
but there's no Springs.
No! No! Wait!
Dantley, where you going?
Can't you see?
It's a Corvette!
A stingray!
Hey, stop this machine!
This is it!
We found our car!
Can you believe your eyes?
It's a Corvette!
Hey!
Hey, mister!
Please stop it!
Stop it!
Stop the crane, for Christ's sake, will ya?
Wait!
Hey!
Hey, hold it!
Hold it!
Hey, stop the machine!
Hey, somebody...
Easy...
Easy.
Keep it coming.
Keep it coming...
Whoa! Hold it.
Kenny?
Hi, Mom.
What happened?
Did you forget your key?
Yeah.
Don't you remember?
There's one in the mailbox.
Uh-oh.
I guess I took it.
I left my key ring at the lounge.
It's late, isn't it?
What time is it?
Late.
Who you out with tonight?
Oh...
That's Mr. Borodino.
He's in real estate.
Why?
I don't know.
Thought I heard his water pump going.
He ought to look at that.
Got the key?
Have fun tonight?
Did you have a date?
Not really.
Say...
Aren't you going to give me a kiss, huh?
Come on.
Give your old mother a kiss.
I haven't seen you all day.
Hi, Bernie.
Naw, it's not late.
Come on over.
Dave?
It's Ed McGrath.
Yes, I am passing the hat again,
only this time,
I was wondering
if you folks could contribute a set of bf GTAs.
Yeah, I know, but it's for a good cause...
I'm pleased to see my efforts this past quarter haven't entirely been in vain.
Most of you are on the plus side of the bell curve at midterm...
Stephanie... with notable exceptions.
Uh, glad to have you join us today, Dantley.
Sally...
Steve...
Ricci, don't try to be heroic.
Watch that pin there.
I got it.
I got it.
Far out!

Hey, Mr. McGrath.
You a dance monitor?
You look like something off
the Lawrence Welk show.
Knock it off, Ken.
I'm enjoying myself.
What are you doing in here, anyway?
I don't know.
I was thinking, maybe we should've lowered that spoiler, maybe even gone for a wing or a fastback.
What are you giving me?
It's perfect.
Be proud of it.
Yeah, you're right.
It is perfect.
Listen, Dantley...
Don't you go bad on me.
I don't want to read in the paper you're sticking up filling stations to support your car habit.
You're a good kid,
talented kid...
But I wish you'd done better in your classes.
What's the difference?
I'm out, aren't I?
O.K., comedian.
You joke about it.
But I had high hopes.
Better attitude, better grades...
Couple of years in junior college,
I'd have seen one of my boys in the art center.
Come on.
Don't you get on me.
I had a good year.
Here.
To general motors.
Wine?
Scotch.
Listen, Dantley...
Kenny...
I been around automobiles all my life.
They're mechanical devices.
They always let you down.
You buy them, drive them, break them, fix them...
You sell them.

Ever think about going pro?
Yeah. Get some Polaroids and go to Detroit.
I been thinking about it.
Polaroids?
Hell, I'll drive that thing right to general motors' front door.
You bet your life, man.
You bet your life.
McGrath to stingray.
O.K., Kootz, let's call it a night.
Roger.
I'm making my turn.
Gee, what a great car.
Do you see Tommy's in front of you?
I see it, and they see me.
Get eight large cokes and a sprite for me.
Uh, Roger, uh, Wilco.
10-4. Over and out.
And, Kootz, take the keys.
Did you copy, Kootz?
Come in, Corvette.
Come in.
Rotten kid.
Where the hell is that little bastard, anyway?
I bet he slopped the drinks on the seat and he's too scared to face us.
Come in, Kootz.
Come in, Kootz.
Stingray, do you read me?
There he is!
No, that's not him.
Oh, yes, it is.
You said to get cokes.
They're right here.
The keys are in my pocket.
I was only in there a minute.
They never started it.
I would have heard.
They must've towed it.
Are you towing cars tonight?
No, and this is legal parking.
Did you leave it running?
Of course I didn't.
The keys are right here.
You said get cokes.
I didn't want no cokes.
Who said
I was thirsty?
I want my car.
Kootz...
You little shit, you lost it!
Dantley, don't we have enough trouble here?
Don't worry, son.
We'll get your car back.
Unfortunately, your car was a Corvette.
They are the favorite target of your professional car ring...
Corvette, Porsche,
'67 Impala,
Buick Riviera,
Dune buggies... and now they're getting into your RVS.
What about your Toronado?
Oh, that's right, sir.
Your principal's car was taken two years ago,
and it was never recovered.
Frankly,
we feel there's a ring working right in this area.
No matter what you've heard in math class,
some things are worth more than the sum of their parts.
Stingray front clip...
we're talking about
$750 right there.
No, I'm sorry to say so,
but that's it for your machine.
It's out of state, and it's in pieces.
I understand you have insurance.
That's it?
It's a kiss-off, after all the work we did?
You ought to be out looking.
Sit down, Dantley.
Look, I know how you feel.
Might as well resign yourselves.
You'll never see that car again.
No one's going to break that car up.
I don't buy that
"sum of the parts" crap.
You guys have seen... it's the best-looking street machine on the west coast.
No one's going to lay a finger on it.
Fill 'er up?
Nope.
Gonna fill you up.
Promise 'em anything...
But give 'em Arpege.
Oh.
Here you go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Beg your pardon?
I sure as hell have.
Have what?
Kid...
This car is in Las Vegas.
What are you talking about?
You've seen it?
Sure, I saw it.
It was in one of those big casinos on a mirror going round.
It's on display.
Where?
Yeah...
Where?
Hell,
I can't remember.
I was with a client on the strip.
Wait, wait.
This was a Corvette, right?
Candy-apple?
Candy-apple metal flake.
Superior mags, Mercury tubes, Gabriel shocks?
Kid, this is the car you're looking for, right?
Yeah.
This is the car
I saw.
Hey, where you going, Las Vegas?
Yeah.
Far out. We take you the whole way. Jump in.
Wow...
What's this supposed to be, anyway, a hearse?
You don't like cars?
Sure, I like cars.
I... I love 'em.
Yeah, you like cars.
What kind of ride you like, charger, Camaro?
Nah.
Corvette, huh?
Yeah. You got it.
Sure, I got it.
Corvette, Anglo.
Anglo, Corvette.
What's wrong with a Corvette?
It's all gm.
What's gm have to do with it?
Excuse me, uh...
17 miles an hour?
On the interstate? You looking for a contact lens?
Ha. You paddies crack me up.
Still doing your speed, huh?
What are you into, miles per gallon?
Class.
We're into class.
O.K. I got to get out now.
No.
We're going to
Los Huevos, remember?
Friend, just let me out.
You don't even have to stop.
Hasta la vista.

Thanks for stopping.
What?
Oh. Wait a minute.
Huh?
Thanks for picking me up.
Oh, yeah.
I thought you were hitchhiking, only you didn't have your thumb out.
You wanna hitchhike, you gotta stick something out.
Where you from?
Newhall.
You go to
MacArthur High?
Yeah.
I just graduated.
No kidding.
I go to
San Fernando.
Huh.
What are you going to Vegas for?
I'm looking for my car.
Somebody stole my stingray.
Word's out it's in Vegas.
You've got a Corvette?
Oh, sure.
Nice Van you got here.
Yeah, really, but you can't tell from up front.
Go on back and, uh, check it out.
Nice.
Who did the work?
Some friends of mine...
You know, in exchange for services rendered.
Services?
What kind of services?
You know what I mean.
Hey, bring up a couple cold ones.
We'll talk about it.
So...
What are you going to Vegas for, a summer job?
Uh-uh.
Full-time, sugar, from now on.
Hey, how old are you?
You know what
I'm talking about.
You've met girls like me.
I guess.
I'm a hooker, for Christ's sake.
A what?
What, you mean like a prostitute?
Well, you know, like a trainee, anyway.
I mean, there comes a time when every amateur goes pro.
Take it!
What are you doing?
I got to get ready.
I'm pulling over.
Ho-ly smoke.
Hi.
Yeah. Hi.
Tell you what.
You can be my first customer.
Oh...
Boy, you got to be kidding.
No.
No, I'm not.
What do you think
I'm worth?
Oh, I... I... I wouldn't know that.
Check it out.
Look what I got here.
Name a figure.
Make me an offer.
$15? What you think I am, an old prune?
Wait a minute.
What did you just say?
Did you just say
15 or 50?
50! Oh, I said 50.
That's what I said.
That's more like it.
You got yourself a deal.
Let's jump in the back.
I wasn't making a bid.
I know. I know.
You never paid for it before in your life.
But then again...
You never had me.
Look, this is my stop.
Really nice riding with you, but will you hand me my gear, please?
Don't be like that.
O.K. Come on.
Here's the thing.
I didn't want to... give me my gear!
My final offer. $20.
Maybe some other time.
Hey, wait.
What's your name, anyway?
You can read, can't you?
"Van... essa."
Excuse me, uh, sir?
Yes, sir?
A room?
A name, please?
N-no. No room.
I'm looking for a car.
The garage is one floor down.
Elevator to your right.
No. No, wait. See, you got a car in the lobby on a mirror?
We sure don't, sir.
Yes, sir?
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Please, sir, it's a stingray, a '73.
Yes, I heard.
A car on a mirror.
That's one thing we don't have.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
You look like a winner.
You really do.
I got something
I'd like you to see.
Just something right here.
Huh? Come here.
My friend and I, we're a little short on cash.
You got 70 bucks on you?
Hey, most of these are real diamonds.
Well, I... hey, 100 bucks.
You gonna say no to a Bulova?
I'm from out of town.
I don't want anything.
All right, I gotcha.
We'll catch you later, champ.
Excuse me, sir?
Yes, sir.
I know this sounds crazy, but you don't have a car in there, do you?
Inside to your left, near the lounge.
I'm talking about a full-sized automobile.
Call it what you want.
It's just a goddamn Hotrod.
A Datsun?
It's a Datsun!
Yeah, I know.
You'd think they'd at least have a Cadillac.
I was told it was a Corvette.
Don't take it so hard.
Why don't we try someplace else?
Good god.
My wallet's gone.
"Most of them are real diamonds."
What'd you have in mind, double or nothing?
I got to eat. Let me wash dishes for it.
It's all paper.
Beat it!
Give the kid his food!
Are you good for it?
I'm not only good for it,
I'll make it interesting.
How about 4 to 1?
How about 10 to 1?
Huh? Huh?
Heads.
I love it!
Go ahead, kid.
What's the catch?
There's no catch.
Boy, are you dirty.
Hey, just call me
Gladstone duck.
It is the damnedest thing.
I cannot lose for trying.
I been in this town
18 hours. I made $18,000.
I've heard of it happening to other guys, but to think it could happen to me...
Makes you believe in the almighty.
Well, it's time for me to go, and I know it.
Let me give you some advice, kid.
Quit while you're ahead.
Get out of Vegas.
You're not going to
Los Angeles, by any chance.
No. I'm going to run this baby back to Avis and catch the first plane to Portland.
O.K. See ya.
Hey, kid.
You're in a bad way.
I tell you what
I'm going to do.
I'm going to pass my lucky streak on to you.
Here.
A $2.00 bill?
That's what
I started with.
Morning.
Climb in. Hi.
Hey, hey!
Wait!
Hey! Stop!
Wait!
Hey. That's quite a car.
We shouldn't have any trouble picking it up.
You got a license number?
No problem.
One-of-a-kind.
Totally unique.
I'm sure it is to your eyes, but there's a lot of fancy cars here.
Are you positive you weren't running after somebody else's automobile?
No way. Look.
See what I did with the steering wheel?
Yeah, what about it?
It's right-hand drive.
Ha! So it is.
What do you know?
Maybe you can let me ride with a patrolman.
I could really help spot it.
The Las Vegas police department is one of the finest in the country.
We can handle it.
Dear Mr. McGrath,
I've tracked the Corvette to Las Vegas, Nevada.
It's here.
I saw it.
Someone probably won it in a card game.
Bet you 4 to 1
I find it.
Get it?
Don't worry about me.
I won't gamble.
I don't have the money for it.
Goodbye for now.
Sincerely,
Kenny Dantley.
P.S. Lots of incredible cars here.
Shit.
Goddamn it.
Hi.
Jesus Christ.
Sorry I scared you.
Do you remember me?
Oh, yeah.
Love your shawl.
The men's room's open.
Do I look like a man?
Who's gonna bother you?
What are you doing here, anyway?
I got a place nearby.
Rent's right.
Oh, you're sleeping in a u-haul, huh?
Forget it.
Get in my Van and make yourself comfortable.
I'm all right where I am.
How you doing?
Life on the street kind of rough, huh?
I seen rougher.
I just got started on the wrong foot, that's all.
Blue jeans.
Kiss of death.
You ever seen those
$100 models work the hotels?
See the way they dress,
how they look?
You look cheap, you are cheap, and it's all downhill from there.
No, I gotta get me an outfit.
You know?
Something sophisticated.
Black velvet with a little choker ribbon.
So what are you doing out here freezing to death?
Hmm?
Get in the Van.
There's food in the fridge.
How do you like that ocean motion?
Oh, it's great.
Really great.
You know, uh,
I hear some people keep fish in them.
You got a girlfriend?
No. No.
Well, no one special.
You ever go out?
Yeah, sure.
Anybody ever tell you you're cute?
Well, you are.
Hey...
You know what I got on under here?
Paper towels?
Nothin'.
My streaker suit.
If you're going to spend the night, you're going to spend it with me.
Comprende, amigo?
Oh, uh, sure.
You know, I-I'm cool.
So... peel off them duds, sailor, and let me see what you got.
Fine. Fine.
Do, uh, do you mind if I close the curtains?
Go ahead.
O.K.
Got it.
There's one.
Here.
Take my towel, would you, and hang it on something.
O.K. Yeah.
Are you O.K.?
Oh, yeah. I just...
Got a little knot in one of my shoelaces.
Just do a little...
Wait a minute.
This is a real honor.
What do you mean?
I'm going to be your first woman.
Oh, no. No, no.
Hey, I've been through this a lot.
A whole lot.
No, you haven't.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Come here.
Mama help.
I know just how you feel.
As a matter of fact, there are a lot of moves that I haven't tried yet.
Moves?
Yeah.
Maneuvers...
Which are going to be very important in my line of work.
You don't mind, do you?
Hey.
Where are you going?
Oh, nowhere.
I just thought things might work out better if I slept over here.
This sure is warmer than that old u-haul.
Are you putting me on?
Oh, no. No, no, no.
It's just...
I got to get some sleep.
I'm really out on my feet.
Hey, come on.
What are you doing?
Nothing. Where's your wallet, anyway?
Let go of that, and stay out of my pockets!
Look, we got to have some rules around here.
You spend the night, you get charged!
I never laid a hand on you!
I don't care! You've got a lot of nerve.
What are you so mad at?
You had your chance.
That'll be 20 bucks!
Stop the hooker stuff!
Cough it up! You spent the whole night!
It ought to be 40!
No way! I didn't do anything!
You stink!
Boy, do I need a pimp!
Everything I got
I give to you!
Full payment for services rendered!
Oh! I hate you!
Oh, yeah?
That's telling her, kid.
What do you want?
This is my gas station.
I like your style.
You ever pumped gas?
Quiet down.
It's me.
I was just going over my mail.
I got a postcard here from Kenny Dantley.
He's in Las Vegas.
That's the idea.
Looks just like a new one, don't it?
You know something, kid?
You catch on fast.
As of today,
I am promoting you to salesman.
I have just seen your first needy motorist.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Take these...
And drop them in her battery.
What?
Alka seltzer.
Yeah.
Plop plop.
Fizz fizz?
Can you handle it?
Yeah. Sure.
Fill her up?
Yes, please.
And may I check under your hood, ma'am?
And, uh, what, shall I look under your hood?
Yeah. O.K.
Uh-oh.
What have we here?
Foam.
Battery problems.
Are you traveling far?
Across the desert.
Well, fortunately for you, we have a special sale on new batteries.
Say, Gil,
I was wondering... you're doing great, kid.
Now, listen.
I want you to cut her fan belt.
This is my magic ring.
Just a flick, a snip.
Just a Nick, that's all.
Here. Take this battery.
She doesn't have any cash.
She lost it all playing Blackjack.
That's what they all say!
She can't pay for the gas.
Her credit card's expired.
Hey!
Stop!
Stop! Crook!
Maybe we could mail her the bill.
Hello, cheapskate.
Hi.
Looks like I lost a quart of Quaker State, two sets of wiper blades...
I got some hot news.
Get in.
Where's my STP?
They even took my credit card machine!
And my anteater.
Dantley, you're in trouble!
I'm working now.
I'll see you.
The job can wait.
It's important. Get in.
Can I maybe...
Oh, no, you don't,
Dantley.
You're working overtime because this is all your fault.
Don't listen to him.
He can take a ride if he wants to.
Are you running a prison farm?
Vámonos.
So, what's the hot news?
You're unemployed.
Very funny.
What are you supposed to be now, a nurse?
A beautician. I got a job in a hotel beauty shop.
Did you notice
I frosted my tips?
It's neat, huh?
Wonderful. Is that what you came to tell me?
I lost a job because you frosted your tips?
Take it easy.
What about the hooker number?
What happened to that?
Nothing.
This just gives me a chance to get my act together.
Hey, can I tell you something?
You're never going to be a prostitute.
You haven't got it in you.
You're right.
You're right.
As a matter of fact, there are no prostitutes in Las Vegas.
Look at this.
"Good company escorts..." oh, god.
What do you think of the name Rosalind?
Rosalind? What's wrong with Vanessa?
First of all, it's not my name.
My real name's Eleanor.
Eleanor?
Second of all,
I'm not sure that Vanessa's got the right tone to it.
It might be a mistake for me.
Rosalind.
Oh, no!
Hey!
That's my car!
How about a lift?
Come on in.
There he is. Tromp it!
What the... are you out of your mind?
Kenny, it's a red light!
Go through it.
That's my car!
I can't move!
It's illegal!
What do you call auto theft?
Sit down and shut up.
Don't be such a...
Oh, god.
God, we're losing him!
Ow!
Kenny, c-o-p, c-o-p.
Oh, perfect!
That's a stolen car!
What's the problem here?
You, uh, take the wrong pill this morning?
This is what
I'm talking about.
We still got a good chance.
This Dodge has the performance package, right?
Are you kidding me?
It's not even his car.
It belongs to the school.
What a nut!
It's not even your car!
So what? I built it.
Can we discuss this after we catch him?
Slow down, friend.
Radio... even faster than rubber.
You did get the license number, right?
License number?
Right. It was, uh...
It was, uh...
Oh, god.
Nevada.
P-r-b-2-3.
Thank you, miss.
On your vehicle
I.D. Check,
stolen Nevada p-r-b-2-3,
we show no such
Nevada registration.
Repeat. No such
Nevada registration.
It's a forgery.
They forged it.
Dear Mr. McGrath,
I saw the car again,
but it eluded my grasp.
I know the world is full of crooks,
but jail is too good
for the guy who's driving it.
Well, at least he's kept it waxed.
Would you believe it?
I met a girl
with this Van.
I think she likes me.
Well, that's all for now.
Sincerely...
Kenny?
What are you writing?
P.S.
The spoiler still looks kind of high to me.
What is that?
A letter to mommy?
No. It's to a friend of mine, one of my teachers.
Teachers... they're worse than parents.
I hate them all.
There's teachers and there's teachers.
This one's different.
He helped me with the car.
Oh, the car.
The car, the car.
I should've guessed.
Hey, hey, I got a terrific idea.
Why don't you write a letter to the car?
Dear car...
I miss you so much.
What are you doing?
Mixing screwdrivers.
Want some?
No, thanks.
Come on.
Vitamin C.
Not for me.
Well, I got to do this.
I'm in training.
If a girl can't hold her liquor, falls asleep with her trick, and then where is she?
Asleep on her trick.
Is that a fact?
What do you drink...
Motor oil?
You can make jokes about a lot of things.
I don't want to hear any jokes about my car till I get it back.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, you're sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
The trouble is, you don't know what a Corvette is.
Hand me a washcloth, would you?
It's not... oh... an ordinary car.
It's a...
I mean...
Families don't buy them to go... go... go to the supermarket in.
Corvette's a man's car.
I mean...
Uh, a woman might buy one, but that's only to get noticed in.
A man drives a Corvette because that's what it is... it's a Corvette.
Where are my pajamas, huh?
Will you give them to me?
It's fast and powerful.
It handles.
It's beautiful.
It's the only sports car made in America and happens to be very...
Important to me.
I know.
It's a terrific car.
What's that?
It was a kiss.
I... I was kissing you.
What do you want to kiss for?
Let's screw.
Yeah, sure.
You didn't say a word about my souvenir.
You gave it to me.
My first cash sale.
Some souvenir.
Come on, Kenny.
You want to kiss?
I can kiss.
I drive my first car at 9,
I overhaul my first transmission at 10,
at 13, I turned the 1/4-mile
in under 12 seconds, and I wait till now to get laid?

Excuse me.
Can you tell me where
Mrs. Dantley is, please?
Oh, she's right back there.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Mrs. Dantley?
Yecch!
Mrs. Dantley?
Yes?
I'm Ed McGrath,
Kenny's shop teacher.
Oh, yes. I've heard so much about you.
Excuse me.
Uh, I was wondering if you've got Kenny's current address.
I haven't heard from him since school let out.
Look out, Fifi.
He's in Las Vegas.
Did you know that?
Hey, Fred, did you hear that?
Kenny went to Las Vegas!
Who does he think he is...
Nick the Greek?
He's not in any trouble, is he?
No. No trouble.
He's fine.
Oh, what a relief.
Thank goodness.
We're moving, and
I have a lot on my mind.
Uh, you going far?
No. Del mar.
What about Kenny?
Oh, don't worry.
He'll find me.
Say, maybe you could tell him.
That would simplify things.
Oh. Oh.
Fine. Sure.
When I see him,
I'll, uh...
Tell him his mother moved to Del Mar.
Dear Mr. McGrath,
guess what?
I'm going steady with a girl from Los Angeles.
Wait till you meet her.
Don't get me wrong.
I still like cars.
I will find that Corvette sooner or later.
I'm not worried
because Las Vegas isn't all that big.
Yours truly,
Kenny.
Nice.
Mighty nice.
You like it?
I'll say.
What can I do for you?
I'm looking for a car.
Not bad.
Nice little car.
You kidding me?
Nicer than this one.
Bad guys came, took it away from me.
Sorry to hear that.
You ever see it around?
Nope.
Too bad.
Hey, kid!
You ought to be careful.
You run up against a car thief, you're liable to wind up at the bottom of lake mead.
I'll remember that.
Hey, stop what you're doing.
What's up?
Get the Corvette.
Prepare it.
We're going to paint it.
"Working. Back late."
Oh, boy.
Working late.
I'll bet you are.
He said it was a lipstick commercial,
so naturally
I believed him.
Honey, when they say movie, you just move on.
You really make me sick, you know that?
Order, please.
Yeah, uh, give me, uh, an everything dog, uh...
A Danny's diamond dog,
large order of fries, and a cherry-lime Rickey.
Kenny?
You really take the cake, you know that?
What's the matter?
Didn't you get my note?
It's Friday night.
I got to work late weekends.
What happened to the beauty parlor?
I quit. Nobody accuses me of petty theft.
Anyway, you're going to be real glad I got this job.
What, free food from now on?
Yeah, but that's not all.
Every car in this city either comes through or goes by here.
So?
I'm helping you, dope.
I'm helping you find your car.
Batter up, girl.
That's, uh, 14 even.
That's mine.

Were you worried about me?
A little bit.

Buenas noches, doll.
What do you want?
You Vanessa?
Maybe.
We got your friend.
Where is he?
What did you do to him?
Kenny?
Yecch!
They're not getting away with this.
You went to the cops, right?
No?
Boy, are you stupid.
Well, as soon as we get you cleaned up, that's where you're going.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Set it on wax.
Just a minute.
Come here, let me get your front.
And don't look so goddamn depressed.
You got them.
And you found your car.
You're a big winner, you lucky son of a bitch.
Kenny.
Kenny, you did it...
All by yourself.
Hey!
Over here!
Ha ha ha!
Mr. McGrath!
Far out!
Kenny, how you doing?
Fantastic. Terri...
I've been looking for you.
Great. Just in time.
I found the car.
I knew you would. I want to talk to you about that.
You should see these guys.
You talk about bad news... mean, stupid, vicious bastards.
I think they were getting ready to kill me.
I know they were.
They got some kind of operation going.
They work out of a body shop.
I know...
Silverado auto body.
Y-yeah.
Oh, you've been doing a little spade work, too.
Oh, aren't we something?
We got 'em.
I even know the name of the guy that runs the show.
You do?
Name's Wayne Lowry... talented body man, designer, good business head, very aggressive.
Yeah?
He's a former student of mine, class of '71.
No shit.
Kenny...
You've been to my house, huh?
You met Marsha.
You know what I got... pool, orange trees, a couple of great kids, huh?
Yeah.
You know how much
I make a year?
It must be kind of rough, huh?
13,000 lousy dollars.
Mr. McGrath, don't you think we ought to go to the police right away?
I mean, you know, if we give 'em too much time, they could get away.
This truck...
Paying monthly for it.
The mortgage payments on the house, they were killing me.
They upped the taxes 100%.
I'm just a little guy,
Kenny, a teacher,
and I'm getting killed.
Everyone has to answer the question... am I a sucker or what?
We all play the game, but who makes up the rules?
Oh, Mr. McGrath.
One day a fellow comes to me with a proposition, a former student of mine doing very well for himself.
You mean...
You stole the Corvette?
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Jesus.
I'm sorry. You got to see that car for what it is.
It's a commodity to be bought and sold just like everything on this earth.
So you go to the police.
You know what happens?
I go to jail.
My wife loses the house...
Probably her mind.
Kids are disgraced.
Is that what you want to do to my family?
We're talking about a victimless crime here.
Who got hurt?
The insurance company pays off.
What the hell?
They can afford it.
So you go to the police?
No.
You got a good head on your shoulders
and a hell of a touch.
There's no reason we can't put you to work.
I'm not talking about pumping gas.
I'm talking about
$700 a week, and you get to do what you were born to do.
How many people get that chance?
How come you never said anything?
We laid up all that fiberglass together.
You never sa... how was I to know you'd fall in love with a pile of junk?
Are you worried about living in Las Vegas?
No.
You worried about your mother?
No.
Good, because
Mom has gone to Del Mar.
Del mar?
Yeah. She's got a boyfriend.
Look, Kenny,
I'm offering you a job.
Tell me, please, you'll take it.
I don't know.
You got to know!
You got to know right now!
Why are you doing this?
You don't owe me anything.
Look behind me.
I don't like him any more than you do, but if I don't hit my lights here in just about a minute, he'll come over here and handle it his way.
He calls the shots,
Kenny. I don't.
Come on.
Say yes, huh?
Come on.
Come on. Please.
Was a hell of a car.
We should've lowered the spoiler, huh?
It's 9:30.
He's coming. He's coming.
He'll be here.
I'm not worried.
I'm just saying it's 9:30, and you been had.
Something tells me this little Turkey is smarter than you thought he was.
Keep your shirt on.
I see him.
Morning, Kenny.
How you feeling?
Fine.
I want you to meet the man you're gonna work for.
Wayne Lowry.
Hey, Jeff, Tony.
Get over here.
Meet a guy who knows about cars.
Alright.
Listen, I'm really sorry about that chain.
I'm sorry about that.
Hello, again.
No hard feelings, right?
We're starting from scratch, right?
Wrong.
That 700 a week?
Not enough.
850.
Now, wait a minute.
First week in advance.
There you go.
I see what you're doing.
I'd do the same thing.
Make 'em pay you what you're worth, right?
Come on.
Gee, Mr. Sinatra,
I didn't know you were in town.
I could go for you in a big way.
That one.
What are you trying to pull?
Oh, I love it.
Kenny...
Did you sell your car?
No, no.
That wasn't your car to sell.
That belonged to the high school.
I never sold it.
So, uh...
Where did all this money come from, Mr. Dantley?
You didn't pay for this with a $2.00 bill.
I got a job.
Pays 850 a week.
850 a week?
We do custom work.
Special cars for special people.
Oh, I get it.
You're going to make it an inside job.
Steal your own car back.
You think you can pull it off?
What are you talking about?
850 a week. That's what I'm pulling off.
Well, what about your car?
You've got to see it for what it is.
It's a commodity to be bought and sold like anything else on this earth.
Don't laugh.
I'm not telling you anything new.
Thing is...
I can have any car I want now...
A Corvette...
A Cadillac...
A Lamborghini.
Lamborghini.
What's the matter?
Oh, it's... it's great,
I guess.
Um...
Wait a minute.
I got something that'll cheer you up.
I'm a paying customer.
Oh, Jesus.
What am I doing?
You're worth a lot more than 20 bucks.
Here's another 50.
And you're worth a lot more than that.
You keep your money.
This one's on the house.
O.K. Hold it right there.
Hi there. Looking for some paint for my wheels.
Sorry, man.
We don't do vans.
I just want to get rid of this.
I want it to say
"Pete's pulsator."
Really classy. Try
Orlando's down the street.
Hey, where'd you get this?
It's my new Van.
I just bought it.
Bullshit.
You're a car thief.
Look at that back window and tell me how much bullshit you want to eat.
Got it from Alslip's this morning.
Had a waterbed in the back.
Wasn't nothing but a boff buggy.
Orlando's your man.
Thank you.
What's so goddamn funny?
You, man, calling that guy a car thief.
Jesus.
Vanessa?
Who?
Come on, already.
Will you talk to me?
Sorry, pal.
She missed two days' work,
and she owes me for some meals.
Hey, stay right there!
Is that you?
I beg your pardon?
I mean, wow!
No wonder you're not slingin' hamburgers anymore.
Have we met?
I don't believe
I know you.
What?
Here you go,
Rosalind.
Play with these.
Oh, Mr. Blanchard,
I'm losing all your money.
How about another drink?
Rosalind? Oh, that's the Rosalind crap again.
Where did you get that dress?
Would you shut up?
If you think... just because... let's take a walk.
Great, great, great.
Just terrific.
You finally went and did it.
A hooker.
The real thing.
Where do you get off?
I'm getting 100 bucks a shot, and you know what I'm doing?
Body work... just like you.
Rosalind, where'd you go?
Oh, coming.
Creep. $100. $100.
I'll give you $200. 1,000.
You don't have to do this.
Come on, Kenny.
It's not your money
I'm after.
Here you go, gin-gin.
Who's your friend?
Oh, this is just my cousin homer.
Goodbye, homer.
Call me tomorrow.
Say, you wouldn't want to get in on the action.
I got some friends coming by.
Its gonna be a hell of a party.
I'd make it worth your while.
Hey, enough is enough.
Beer time.
O.K.
Hey, don't forget to turn off the lights and lock up.
What is that?
Wow.
What the hell happened?
Look out!
Oh, you son of a...
Ow!
That's it.
Yeah!
Give him to me, baby.
Come on, now.
Come on, baby.
This time I got you. Ha!
Yeah.
Now!
Ow!
Sir, the keys?
I'll get it.
Hello, old buddy.
I'm glad you made it.
Take it easy, pal.
I don't want any trouble.
I've got expensive equipment here.
Kenny Dantley, get your ass out of here!
I'm going to call the cops.
Oh, no!
Don't do that.
You in the tub...
You're checking out.
I'm not coming!
Who do you think you are, anyway?
You have no right to take me anywhere.
I just want to get my flipper off.
Oh!
I don't want to go!
You're embarrassing me!
Oh! Let me go!
Oh! I'm going to smack you!
Oh, and what's this?
Where's your
Lamborghini, big shot?
I'm not gonna forget what I saw.
You were making a dirty movie.
I was not!
Yeah? What do you call it, a pg?
It was not a movie.
It was a short.
Oh!
Stop this car!
I'm getting out!
Oh, no, you're not!
We're going the wrong way!
I know. I'm trying to get us on the freeway.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That was it, dumbo.
You missed it.
I got it. Hold on.
What are you doing?
Where's the freeway?
I got it. Look for a place to turn around.
Are you doing this on purpose?
Oh, I see what's happening, and you don't fool me a bit.
Look out!
You had this planned the whole time.
Trying to scare me, huh, you little creep?
Well, it's not gonna work.
I'm enjoying it, see?
I love this.
Boy, are you a nut.
Where's that freeway?
Uh-oh.
What's he supposed to be doing, shooting at us?
Bang, bang, yourself, Mac.
Get down!
What are you doing?
That's it.
That's it!
I knew I'd find it!
The freeway!
End of the line, folks.
So what happens now, you turn around and take me home?
Looks like I have to.
Aah!
You're insane!
Kenny! Kenny!
Kenny, stop!
Stop! Stop!
Aah!
Whoa!
He's back!
I don't believe it!
Wow! Amy, come here and look!
Isn't it great?
Hot!
You wait right here.
This won't take long.
- Uh-oh. Look out.
- Oh, brother.
Alright, now.
No running.
Stay single file.
Hey, look!
The car! It's back!
Hey, come on!
It's back!
What happened to it?
Who is responsible for this?
Who set off that alarm?
Good lord.
Is this our car?
Yes, sir. It is.
You! Young lady!
Do you have an explanation to offer?
Sure don't, Jack.
Excuse me.
Well, who does?
Ask bozo.
Bozo?
Dantley!
How did you get it back?
Let's just say...
I found it.
And what about the police?
You've talked to them?
They are aware of this?
No.
They don't know a thing.
You should have.
They should be informed.
What's the difference?
You got the car back, didn't you?
Alright, everybody.
Back inside.
The fire drill is over.
Uh, Mr. Bacon?
Yes, Dantley?
There is one thing.
What is it?
I'd like my diploma.
Yes, of course.
It's in my office.
Kenny, can I talk to you?
What do you want?
What happened?
Money wasn't good enough?
Couldn't get along with Wayne?
Should have called me.
Kenny, listen to me, please.
You need money, another car, a job.
Give you my best recommendation.
I got it! Ta-da!
Congratulations.
Where you going with my Diplo...
Kenny, tell me what
I got to hear. Please.
So long, Mr. McGrath.
Kenny. Kenny, please.
Hey, Kenny, where you going?
Stick around.
Meet me after school.
Nah.
What about the car?
Going to buy it?
Nope.
What?
It's a terrific car.
Superior mags,
Mercury tubes,
Gabriel shocks.
Why don't you buy it, Kootz.
Hey, Kenny.
Where you going?
Hey, Kenny?
Hey, you with the funny walk.
Come on. You're not all that tough.
Give me my diploma.
You think I spent five years here for an empty envelope?
Oh... danger!
You mad because
I gave the car back?
Ha ha!
Ah, I see what it is.
Any guy...
That doesn't own a Corvette just doesn't get a kiss from you.

Hi. Ed Ramsey from Delos.
If there's anyone who doesn't know what Delos is, well, as we've always said...
...Delos is the vacation of the future, today.
At Delos you get your choice of the vacation you want.
There's Medieval World, Roman World and, of course, Westworld.
Let's talk to some people who've been there.
Pardon me, sir. What is your name?
Gardner Lewis.
Just got back from Westworld.
Tell us how you liked it, Mr. Lewis.
When you played cowboys and Indians as a kid, you'd point...
...go "bang, bang" and the other kid would lie down and play dead.
Well, Westworld is the same thing, only... only it's for real!
I shot six people!
Well, they weren't real people!
What Mr. Lewis means is he shot six robots...
...scientifically programmed to look, act, talk and even bleed just like humans do.
Isn't that right?
Well, they may have been robots.
I mean, I think they were robots.
I mean, I know they were robots!
Yes, the robots of Westworld are there to serve you...
...and to give you the most unique vacation experience of your life.
Thank you, sir.
And you, madam?
Hello.
What is your name?
My name is Janet Lane, and I was in Roman World.
What is the one thing that stands out in your mind about Roman World?
Oh, well, I think it would be...
...the men!
I just feel marvelous! I mean...
...it's just a warm, glowing place to be!
Thank you very much.
Oh, thank you very much!
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
- And you, sir?
- Yeah?
What is your name, sir?
Oh, I'm Ted Mann.
I'm a stockbroker from St. Louis.
And, which world did you just come from, sir?
Oh, you're not going to believe this!
I've just been the sheriff of Westworld for the last two weeks!
Did it seem real to you, sir?
It's the realest thing I've ever done!
I mean that!
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.
And you, sir?
My name's Arthur Caine.
I've been in the castle.
I've had a couple of sword fights and three jousts.
And I...
I married a beautiful princess.
Is that something you've always dreamed of doing, sir?
All my life!
There were some of the comments of people who've just returned from Delos.
Why don't you arrange...
...to take our Hovercraft to Medieval World,
Roman World and Westworld?
Was it worth $1,000 a day?
Yes!
Contact us today, or see your travel agent.
Boy, have we got a vacation for you!
505. 345. 675. Delta 9.
505. 345. 675. Delta 9.
This is Delos Control to Station 3.
You are cleared on Vector 79, on 195...
We anticipate scanning in about four and a half minutes.
I'm not worried at all. I'm just...
I'm just curious.
How much do they weigh?
Three or four pounds.
That heavy.
Do they have much of a kick?
A Colt.45?
Well, I never fired one before.
What about that thing where you go like this over the gun?
- Fanning?
- Yeah.
- What about it?
- Is that hard to do?
Now...
The gunbelt, does it have those strings to tie around your leg?
If that's the kind you want.
That's the kind I want. I think it's probably better for quick draws, you know.
It all depends.
What kind of gunbelt did you have the last time?
I had the one without the strings.
And you could draw fast?
Then maybe it doesn't matter after all.
The guns they give you are real guns?
Real guns.
That's incredible.
Give us a shift to 197...
...and take it down to Port 43.
Negative acceleration at 22.
So long as you maintain passenger comfort.
Sigma-sigma was transferred according to the log at 041.
The orientation on the resort will now begin.
Please put on your earphones.
Don't you want to listen?
I heard it the last time.
...consists of three separate resort areas, each with its own special appeal.
Whichever resort you have chosen...
...we are sure you will have a fascinating and rewarding stay here.
Western World is a complete re-creation of the American frontier of 1880.
Here it is possible to relive the excitement and stresses of pioneer life to the fullest.
Western World is a life of lawless violence, a society of guns and action.
This is Medieval World, where we have reconstructed 13th-century Europe.
A world of chivalry and combat, romance and excitement.
Our teams of engineers have spared no expense in this re-creation...
...precise to the smallest detail.
Then we have Roman World:
A lusty treat for the senses in the setting of delightful, decadent Pompeii.
Here the traveler experiences the sensual, relaxed morality that existed at the peak...
...of the Imperial Roman Empire.
All together, these resorts comprise Delos...
...the most exciting vacation spot in the history of man.
This is Delos Control to Station 3.
Your negative deceleration should be 25...
...and your ground speed should be
355 and dropping.
The whole spectrum of technology has been employed in Delos...
...for the vacationer's pleasure.
Expensive and unusual,
Delos is not for everyone.
But for those who choose it, it is truly a unique and rewarding experience.
We have you on Grid 5.
Notify ground crews.
Stand by. Locking in now.
Shut down 2, shut down 3.
Shut down 2, shut down 3.
Nice job, everybody.
Welcome to Delos.
Please go to your color-coded tram...
...which will take you to the world of your choice.
Give your name to the attendant.
Welcome to Delos.
Please go to your color-coded tram...
...which will take you to the world of your choice.
May I have your name, please?
John Blane.
- Peter Martin.
- Thank you.
Please go to your color-coded tram which will take you...
...to the world of your choice.
We are sure you will enjoy your stay in Western World.
Was she a...?
Probably.
That's amazing!
Supposedly, you really can't tell... except by looking at the hands.
They haven't perfected the hands yet.
Nothing can go wrong.
You will enjoy your stay in Roman World.
While you are there, please feel free to indulge your every whim.
Medieval World exists for you, the guest.
Nothing can go wrong.
I have a quick fade on the CRT and my balance controls don't seem to help me.
I'm keeping this in real time.
Switch me over to an on-line status and I'll do it manually.
You've got a three-millisecond cycle delay which should be computed in.
I don't know what to do if the stagecoach is late.
Oh! It's fantastic!
I reckon that's everything.
Bath's down the hall.
Bath'll cost you two bits for hot water.
Dinner at 7:00, breakfast at 6:30.
Get lunch on your own.
Couple of places in town to eat.
Don't look like much here, but we have everything.
Just a minute.
You mean to tell me he's a robot?
That's what I mean to tell you.
We're paying $1,000 a day for this?
It's authentic.
The West of the 1880s.
Well, at least they could've made it a little more comfortable.
But that's the point.
This is really the way it was.
If you wanted comfort, you should have stayed in Chicago.
Julie would have loved all this!
Poking around for hours in all those funny shops, looking for silly...
What the hell is wrong with you?
You're a lawyer!
You know better than anybody else what a ride she took you for.
Well, the kids...
Fine, the kids!
But you're here, six months later, still thinking about her.
No, not really.
She just came to mind, is all.
There's a lot to do here.
- What'll it be?
- Whiskey.
What about you?
Vodka martini on the rocks with a twist of lemon. Very dry, please.
Just give him whiskey.
He's new in town.
You've got to get into the feel of the thing.
I feel silly.
Why?
It's like a joke.
It's not a joke, it's an amusement park.
It's the best amusement park in the world.
All you have to do is have fun.
There's some pretty rough-looking customers here.
How many of them are...?
Guests like us?
Who knows?
That's the beauty of this place.
It doesn't matter.
It may look rough, but it's still just a resort.
There's no way to get hurt here.
Just enjoy yourself.
What is this stuff?
It doesn't say.
God! Give me this!
Puts hair on your chest.
Yeah.
Sloppy with your drink.
Get this boy a bib.
Go on!
He needs his momma.
Kill him.
You talk too much.
You say something, boy?
I said, you talk too much.
Why don't you make me shut up?
Your move.
Pretty realistic, huh?
Listen, are you sure he was a...?
Of course. You don't really think you shot anybody, do you?
Wow!
Hey, John...
How do I know I'm not going to kill another guest with this thing?
Try it.
Shoot me.
Go on, shoot.
Shoot!
The gun has a sensing device.
It won't fire at anything with a high body temperature.
Only something cold, like a machine.
They thought of everything.
The Black Knight won't be repaired till tomorrow afternoon.
Yeah, I have the banquet scheduled for 5:30, if that conforms.
What do folks do for companionly entertainment in this town?
I wouldn't know about such things.
I'm just runnin' this hotel.
Miss Carrie has a real nice saloon down at the end of the street.
Now, I won't have talk of that woman in this house.
Not over my dinner.
The food's real good, ma'am.
Thank you, stranger.
You're a gentleman of some breedin'.
Isn't she terrific?
Who's Miss Carrie?
You fellas new in town?
Yep.
Whiskey.
Just passin' through?
Maybe.
Lookin' for some fun?
Maybe.
Well, you've come to the right place.
There's plenty of fun here.
That's Cindy and Arlette.
Arlette's from Paris.
Perhaps you gentlemen are taking a likin' to 'em.
Perhaps.
They're real accommodatin'.
- They look it.
- Listen...
Why don't you just go on upstairs and we'll reckon accounts later?
- Sounds good to me.
- Are those two girls machines?
Now, how can you say a thing like that?
Come on.
What's goin' on?
They're robbin' the bank.
Robbin' the bank?
Hey, maybe we oughta go help out.
You don't know.
It might be fun to play bank robbers.
Look, Pete, this is better.
There...
There is something I have to tell you.
I don't know if it matters...
...but it matters to me.
I haven't ever had a...
Well, I hardly know you, if you know what I mean. I mean...
We just met a few minutes ago.
You're probably very nice.
I feel funny.
Why?
I think you're very nice.
How was it? Wasn't it terrific?
Boy, machines are the servant of man!
Wasn't that great?
Not bad.
Not bad. Now you're the big lover!
Well, you know how it is.
Some guys have a way with women.
Shooting stopped.
I guess we missed the robbery.
You can't have everything.
John...
...this place is really fun!
I think it's the jugular unit.
- What do you think?
- Should we try and rewire her?
No, I'd replace the whole unit rather than try and repair it.
With a 10?
Use an XX-50 if we have any in stock.
The double X's have a longer lifespan.
A 50 may not fit in here.
Maybe you can shift the integrator unit further up into the cavity.
I'll try it.
Balance servo again?
Yeah, she fell over this afternoon.
I think it's the sensor.
If it's the central unit we'll open her up.
You get a confirmation before you do that.
What's he in for?
Central malfunction.
Another one?
Since we opened the resort, we had a failure and breakdown rate...
...conforming to computer predictions.
That is 0.3 malfunctions for each 24-hour activation period...
...concurrent or not.
Now, this was an anticipated operations aspect of the resort...
...and we were fully able to handle it.
The majority of the breakdowns were minor or peripheral...
...until about six weeks ago.
Then Roman World had a rise in breakdown rate...
...which doubled in a week.
In addition, we saw a disproportionate rise...
...in central as opposed to peripheral breakdowns.
Now, we identified some problems with humidity control...
...and regained homeostasis.
Despite our corrections, the breakdown rate continued to climb.
Then Medieval World began to have trouble.
Now we're seeing more Western World breakdowns.
And there's a clear pattern here which suggests an analogy...
...to an infectious disease process spreading from one resort area to the next.
Perhaps there are superficial similarities to disease.
It's only a theoretical concept.
There are many ways to order that data.
I must confess,
I find it difficult to believe in...
...a disease of machinery.
We aren't dealing with ordinary machines here.
These are highly complicated pieces of equipment...
...almost as complicated as living organisms.
In some cases, they've been designed by other computers.
We don't know exactly how they work.
Okay, up gain 437...
I'm not getting sound pickup from the tenth quadrant.
Okay, my telemetry is good.
Repeat, I have good telemetry.
We have sunrise at 0.43.
Ready on all quadrants.
Energize grid.
Grid energized.
All right, then give me a 436, if you can patch that in.
If not, 435.
I have sound now. Thank you very much.
Yes, I want scrambled eggs and bacon and cinnamon toast.
Do you have cinnamon toast? You do?
Okay, send it down to Central Control Room, Console 3.
Wait a minute.
What was that? No grounding on Unit 5?
Try a bypass.
I have readings on all units, 5 included.
Hold on a minute.
All right, let's stand by for resort activation.
You ready on Phase 443?
Okay, we're going to activate at 59...
Lower gain Alpha 2...
Ready on six, on five, on four...
...on three, on two. Activate now.
"Oh, give me a home
"Where the buffalo roam
"And the deer and the antelope play
"Where seldom is heard
"A discouraging word
"And the skies are not cloudy all day"
What do you want?
"Home, home on the range"
Not one word.
Do you mind if I finish shaving?
Have you no sense of...
Was he bothering you?
He isn't gonna bother you again.
I'm here to tell you that things have changed.
There's law here now.
You can't go around plugging whoever you please.
But, Sheriff, it was self-defense.
That's what they all say.
He shot a man.
He'll have to stand trial.
Judge'll be here next week.
If I were you,
I wouldn't trouble over your friend here.
Judge Benson likes to hang 'em.
Hang 'em high.
Look, Sheriff...
Beat it.
I said, beat it!
I've never been in jail before.
First time for everything.
But I haven't done anything wrong.
You shot a man. That's something.
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.
Well, Chicago's a long way from here, fella.
A thousand miles and more.
Hold it!
I guess that sort of makes us desperados.
Yeah, I guess.
Well, what do we do now?
The way I figure it, anything we want.
- There's no law in that town now.
- I'll say.
We go in there, and we do anything we want!
You know what?
What?
I almost believe all this.
Why shouldn't you believe it?
It's as real as anything else.
Yep.
I reckon.
What can you give me in Grid 7?
We have that on SM-514.
Transfer, now.
Transferred.
Reschedule.
She wants to meet the king.
We have to restructure for that.
Can't disappoint a guest.
Yeah, listen, this is the third day in a row that I've called you about my laundry.
You've got all my shirts...
We're rechecking the tapes on the mechanism now.
We have programmed infidelity in the queen...
...as of two minutes ago.
All right, coming up on the castle, zero...
Now.
It also conforms with your five-year history at this time of the year.
Leave me now.
My queen!
If the king should hear of this, we would both be put to death!
I would be more than happy to die for you, my lady.
Let us pray it shall not be so.
I have news.
The Black Knight has returned, and seeks a match with you.
The Black Knight...?
None other.
Is he pretty tough?
He has the strength of ten, and cunning besides.
But...
...his sight is weak in his left eye.
Stay to his left and you will prevail and win the day.
Confirmation of the reprogramming of that Black Knight...
...for left lateral weakness and instability for tomorrow.
I shall see you on the morrow?
My lady.
Schedule for tomorrow a.m.
It's his last day in the resort.
Let's make it a lulu.
Tomorrow a.m. Broadswords.
Schedule locked.
We have a problem with the air conditioning in Beta section.
Send a crew out.
Yes! He can be sheriff any time he wants.
That is correct.
Just give him the badge.
Now, I'm the new law around here.
You think you can handle things?
You wanna try me?
A thousand pardons, my lord.
What is your name, child?
Daphne.
Daphne.
Oh, I love this place.
I love my horse.
I love my horse and I love Julie.
Oh, shut up, will you?
I like the spots on my horse.
- Did you see the spots on my horse?
- Your horse is beautiful.
- Thank you very much. I like yours, too.
- Thank you.
Look out!
Let me handle this!
Goddamn it!
- Do you suppose it's real?
- Hell, no!
That's not supposed to happen!
Maybe it is!
Maybe it's part of the thing!
The hell! Goddamn machines, anyway!
That's not supposed to happen!
A rattlesnake struck a guest?
He was shooting at it and he missed.
The snakes are programmed never to hit on a strike.
- Was the guest injured?
- Minor puncture wounds.
It's inexcusable to injure a guest.
Pick up that snake for a total post at once.
Check all the snake's central mechanisms tonight during the repair period.
Doesn't anything work around here?
Logic circuits on the snake simply failed to respond.
There was no sign of mechanical damage or tampering...
...and no clue to the malfunction.
Central mechanism psychosis?
I feel we should shut down the resort for a month.
Oh, that seems rash.
A snake injured a guest.
We can't allow that to happen.
Many elements of the Delos Resort are potentially dangerous.
That's part of the appeal.
But if they become truly dangerous...
I agree.
We can announce that the resort is overbooked...
...and not allow any further new guests to arrive.
We can take care of the ones already here.
If we can't insure the safety of the guests, we'll be in desperate trouble.
But we can insure their safety.
Everything's fine.
All right, let's start that bar fight.
Cheat!
John, what do you say?
Hit me.
Now, that's just rude!
Hey, Sheriff! Come on!
What's his problem?
Nothing. He got shot up today, so we're taking the opportunity...
...to replace the visual cortex.
Using the new infrared units.
And we're increasing audio sensitivity.
You called for me, my lord?
Yes.
How long have you been in the palace, Daphne?
Since I was three, my lord.
Charming.
I think we ought to get to know each other better, Daphne.
Better, my lord?
I can reward you well.
My lord...
Daphne...
My lord!
Daphne...
My lord forgets himself!
Problem with the girl.
Program breakdown.
What's the trouble?
One of the castle machines isn't responding.
Refusing a guest seduction.
Get her out of there, and report it to central repair.
Right.
Refusing...?
- Did you find the trouble?
- No apparent trouble.
But she wasn't following programming.
She refused a guest seduction and she is a sex model.
Certainly is.
Will they shut down?
No, the directors feel that to close down now would hurt tourist confidence.
I don't like it.
Breakfast.
I'm never gonna drink again.
Okay, 437...
I'm not getting sound pickup in the tenth quadrant.
Please set numbers to console...
Hold, varlet!
Are you speaking to me?
None other, sire.
Look, I'm hungry and I...
Prepare for thy doom, thy scurrilous knave! Huh!
Wait a minute! Can't we talk this over?
What, have you no spine, varlet?
Well, I...
The queen!
Full monitor.
Okay.
Let him go.
Oh, what a hangover.
All right, varlet!
We're losing a little tolerance.
Bring me up.
Shut down! Shut down immediately!
Circuits don't respond, sir!
Then cut the robot power!
Power cut!
Oh, my head!
I'm freezing!
Gotta get to the hotel.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
- They're not responding!
- Shall we cut the main power grid, sir?
Shut it all down! Shut it all down!
Hold it!
Come on, not now.
Not you again.
It's too early.
Let me do it this time.
Your move.
I'm shot.
What?
I'm shot!
John...?
Oh, my God!
Draw.
Sir, we have no control over the robots at all!
- They're running on stored charge!
- How long can they go?
Some will begin to run down in an hour.
Others can go a full 12!
- Turn the main grid back on!
- The relays must be frozen.
We can't get back our power!
Hello? Hello?
Now, how are we going to get out of here?
All these doors are electrically powered.
Now, get these doors open in here before we all suffocate!
Temperature elevated, 98 degrees.
Oxygen, 17 percent and dropping.
Get that power on so we can open these doors.
Hey!
Don't shoot me!
Hey, wait a minute!
What's the matter with you?
Hold out your hands.
Let me see your hands!
You're a guest!
You really gave me a scare.
Look, everything's broken down.
The machines have gone crazy.
You know about the machines?
Yeah, I repair 'em.
There's one chasing me now.
A gunslinger.
Gunslinger.
Must be a model 404, maybe a 406.
If he's a 406, he's got all the sensory equipment.
It's a beautiful machine!
He's after me!
I don't doubt it.
What can I do?
There's nothing you can do.
He'll get you.
You haven't got a chance.
There must be something!
Fella, don't kid yourself.
There are things you could try:
Acid for his visual system, noise for his hearing...
No matter what, he'll always be one jump ahead of you!
You haven't got a chance!
Yes, I do.
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
All right. It's all right.
- It's okay.
- Help me!
All right, all right.
- Help me!
- You're gonna be all right.
Help me!
No water...
- Go ahead. Go ahead and drink.
- No water...
- I'm trying to help you.
- No water. No. No!

Well, he looks at life, and he doesn't see.
Doesn't see the bright blue sky, 
Doesn't hear the train go by,
Doesn't sing a song!
Little fellow, what's wrong?
What's to become of Milo?
Lost in a vacant stare.
Doesn't have a dream,
Doesn't even care.
He's a boy who might rise high,
Maybe even touch the sky,
All the world could be his pie, if he'd only try!

Milo: Nah. I'm not doing anything. 
What's there to do?
Ralph: Nothing I guess. Nothing is fun any more.
Milo: Right! Everything's a big waste of time.
When I'm in school. all I want to do is be out. 
When I'm not in school, I wanna be someplace else.
(Sighs) If only something could happen some time.
Ralph: Yeah.
Milo (muffled): What's the use of subtracting turnips from turnips? Or carrying a 3?
Or knowing how to spell February. Feb-ru-ary!
Ralph: Yeah, everything's a drag.
And who wants to sit around doing homework anyway?
Milo: Everything seems so impossible.

How come it seems it so-- small? 
And kind of empty?

Slow down, slow down, slow down, slow down.
Slow down or I'll arrest the lot 'o ya.
Milo: How can I slow down? I'm not even moving.
Shrift: Oh, it's you is it? I mighta known it'd be a boy.
Talking back to an officer, that's a misdemeanor. 
Where were you on the night of July 25th? Hmm?
Milo: July 25th? Wha- What's that got to do with it?
Shrift: Do with it?? It's my birthday.
That's what it's got to do with it!
Boys are always forgetting people's birthdays.
Milo: Well, I'm sorry...
Shrift: You have committed the following crimes-"underceding" the speed limit, a misdemeanor.
Milo: But I wasn't even moving!
Shrift: Wasn't even moving, eh?
"Overstructing" traffic, a felony.
Milo: Look, you can't do this! I wasn't doing anything.
Shrift: Not doing anything. 
I think you'll admit at your age, that's a crime.
Now then, would you like a long sentence, or a short sentence?
Milo: Well, I..I suppose a short one. 
If I have a choice.
Shrift: How about "I am."?
It's the shortest sentence I know.
Milo: It's- it's very kind of you to give me such a - a short sentence.

We certainly don't get many travelers these days.
Now what can I do for you? I'm the Whether Man.
Milo: How do you do sir. I wonder if-
Could you tell me where the right road to a 
-a Diction-opolis or- or someplace...
Whether Man: Dictionpolis? Well now, well now, well now. 
I don't know of any wrong road to Dictionopolis, so if this road goes to Dictionopolis at all, it must be the right road. Don't you think?
And if it doesn't, it must be the right road to somewhere, mustn't it?
Because there are no wrong roads to anywhere.
Do you think it'll rain?
Milo: But I thought you said you were the "weather" man.
(Scooting Noise)
Whether Man: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm the whether man, not the weather man.
For after all, it's more important to know whether there will be a change in the weather, than what the weather will be, don't you think?

Splendid question.
Expectations is the place you must always go- before you get where you're going.
Of course some people never get beyond Expectations.
But my job is to hurry them along anyway.
So I'd better hurry you along, too.
Milo: Thank you. Thank you. Buh- But I, I really think
I can- I can find my own way.
Whether Man: Splendid. Splendid. Splendid. 
I do so hate to make up my mind about anything.
Whether or not you find your way, you're bound to find some way.
If you happen to find my way, please return it. 
You did say it was going to rain, didn't you?

I hope I'll meet somebody whose sentences make as much sense backwards as forward.

We are the Letharges. (Snores)
Milo: I'm very pleased to meet you.
Uh- Could you help me, please? I think I'm lost.
Lethargians: Think?! Don't...say... that. 
It's against the law to think in the Doldrums.
Milo (Yawning): That's ridiculous. 
Everybody thinks.
Lethargians: We don't. And most of the time, you don't. 
And that's why you're here. You weren't thinking.
And you weren't paying attention, either. People who don't pay attention often get stuck in the Doldrums...(Snores)
Milo: Hahaha. That's silly. 
Hahaha!
Lethargians: Stop that at once! 
Laughing is against the law.
And smiling is permitted only on alternate Thursdays.
Milo: But if you can't laugh or think, what can you do in the Doldrums?
Lethargians: Do? Why? You can do anything...
(Singing): As long as it's nothing.
Everything, as long as it isn't anything.
So... don't say there's nothin' to do in the Doldrums.
Don't say we don't (snores) days..
We dawdle a bit... and then

We loiter a while, 
...and dawdle again.

You can't spend the rest of your life in the Doldrums.
How did you get here anyway?

I guess I just wasn't thinking.

I'd rather not do...(yawns) anything.
Tock: The Lethargians don't want you to do anything, even eating or breathing.
Milo: Breathing? But I've always breathed!
I can't stop now.
Tock: Then get started thinking. Think boy, think!
Milo: What do I think about?
Tock: Think of birds that swim, and fish that fly.

Tick: Whew. For a minute I was afraid
I'd snapped my main spring.
You must excuse my gruff conduct, but you see it's traditional for watch dogs to be ferocious.
Milo: I thought you were just great, but are you sure it's alright...to leave those Lethargians back there alone?
Tock: Oh, I don't just watch Lethargians, I watch boys too. And right now, I'd say, you needed a watchdog.
And anyway I just love automobile rides!
Milo: I'm very pleased to have you along.
My name is Milo.
Tock: Milo. That's a strange name for a boy.
My name is Tock.
Milo: Well, I mean uh-well- isn't that kind of a strange name...for a dog?
Tock: Oh, no. How many names can you give a watchdog?
Actually, my name is Tick-Tock.
My friends call me Tock.
Milo: May I call you Tock?
It's about time I had a friend.
Tock: It's about time. Time? 
But time is your friend.
Time marches on, time and tide wait for no man-
Tock (Singing): Time. Time. Time. Time.
Time is a gift, fleeting and swift,
Ticking and tocking itself away,
Itself away, a way of saying better beware,
Time is a gift, precious and rare, 
Take it and make of it all you can.
Use all you can, there's not a moment to spare.
So, take a second to look around,
See a sight, hear a sound.
Take a minute to concentrate, 
Analyze...Contemplate!
Take an hour and change the fate of the world!
Time is a gift, given to you,
Given to give you the time you need,
The time you need to have the time of your life!
Time ticks hastily away,
Take time to save it every day!
Time saved, in the nick of time,
Is golden time.
Milo: Time, time, time, time.
(Milo and Tock Begin Doing Rounds, 
Singing Different Lyrics Simultaneously in Harmony)
Milo: Time is a gift, fleeting and swift,
Tock: Times...ticks...
Milo: Ticking and tocking itself away.
Tock: ...Hastily.
Milo: Itself a way of saying better beware.
Tock: Time to save it every day.
Milo: Time is a gift, precious and rare.
Tock: Time...saved...
Milo: Take it and make of it all you can.
Tock: ..in the nick of time.
Milo: Use all you can, there's not a moment to spare.
Tock: Is golden time...
Milo: So take a second to look around,
Tock: So just stop and
Milo: See a sight, hear a sound.
Tock: ...look around.
Milo: Take a minute to concentrate.
Tock: And concentrate.
Milo: Analyze, Contemplate.
Tock (echoes): Analyze. Contemplate.
Milo: Take an hour, and change the fate of the world!
Tock: Take an hour, and change the fate of the world!
Milo: Time to give, given to you,
Tock: Time...time...time...
Milo: Given to give to the time you need:
Tock: Time...
Milo: The time you need to have the time of your life!
Tock: Time...of your life.
Milo/Tock together:
The time you need to have the time of your life....!
Milo: Golly! I've never seen such a- 
...a beautiful country, Tock. What country is it?
Tock: Well, it used to be called the Kingdom of Wisdom, until the old King died.
But then, it was divided into two states. On one side, Dictionopolis, the Kingdom of Words.
It's ruled by King Azaz, who has an iron law that all words are more important than numbers.
The other side is Digitopolis, the Kingdom of Mathematics, ruled by the Mathemagician.
His law is that numbers are more important than words.
And over there, in the mountains of ignorance, the demons are gathering, just waiting...
(Thunder Roars)
And beyond those mountains, Milo, is our only chance.
The C-a-s-t-l-e in the A-i-r.
Milo: Well that's where I'm going.
The Castle in the Air.
Tock: Don't say that again, Milo.
It makes the demons very angry.
But at least there's one sane and intelligent man left in this country: Chroma the Great.
That's one of his best rainbows.
Milo: Hey! There goes the Whether Man.
Whether Man: Have you found my way yet?
I hope it isn't mildewed.
Tock: Come on, Milo. Let's go. We're wasting ti-
Milo: I know, I know. We're wasting time.
(Pleasant, Traveling Music Plays)
Tock: Stop! 
Milo: What's that?
Tock: Hmm...Unless I'm very much mistaken, you just missed running into the abode of Kakofonous A. Dischord.
Kakofonous A. Dischord (KAD): Ahh, whooo!!
(Honks Horn) Beautiful, isn't it. 
KAD (singing): But.. Of all the beautiful things in life, that nature has provided. (Horn Honks)
A daffodil. A buttercup.
A bird...(bird tweets a melody).
(KAD hums/mumbles to himself, laughs)
KAD: The loveliest things of all to me,
I long ago decided.
Cannot be seen,...they only can,
be heard!
(Music and Pots Begin Banging in Rhythm)
(Pots Continue to Clang, Thunder Roars)
KAD: I..I..give people noise.
(Pots Continue to Clang, Thunder Roars)
Wonderful, deafening, earsplitting noise.
KAD: Whistles and squeaks, screeches galore.
KAD: Jingles and jangles, oh how I adore all that-
KAD: Noise, noise! Marvelous noise!
KAD: Horrible, hideous. Awful, insidious-
KAD: Noise, noise, noise!
KAD: You don't look well my boy.
KAD: Hey here, let's have a look at you (Horn Honks)
KAD: Just as I suspected, you are suffering from a severe lack of noise.
KAD: Now, this'll fix you right up.
KAD: Honking horns, screeching trains, bells, shouts,
KAD: Shrieks, gurgling drains. And all the rest of-
KAD: -those wonderfully unpleasant sounds we use so much of today.
KAD: Now here, take this and you'll never have to hear a pleasant sound again.
Milo: No! No- no thank you. I don't want to be cured of pleasant sounds.
KAD: Well now, that's very unusual. 
However, nothing odd.
KAD: I'll just give it the Awful Dynne.
Milo: The Awful Dynne? *(Din).
Dynne: Whoa hahaha! Ahhh, that was good, Master.
KAD: This is my assistant, the Awful Dynne.
Milo: Gee, I don't think I've ever met an awful Dynne before.
KAD: What?? Never met an Awful Dynne before? 
Oh you must be mistaken.
When you're playing in your room and making a lot of noise, what do they tell you to stop?
Milo: Why, the- the awful din! (Dynne Laughs)
KAD: And when the street is being repaired with about 50 jackhammers going all day, (Jackhammer Noise)
KAD...what does everybody complain of?
Milo: The awful din!
KAD: Right, and now my valued assistant will show you var-de-ous (*various) examples from my rare, exotic, and seldom heard...noises.
Dynne? (Horn Honks)
Dynne laughs/begins singing)
Dynne: Didja...ever hear an elephant tap dance, on a tin roof late at night? / That's noise...beautiful noise!
Did you ever hear a centipede crying...when his shoes don't fit him right? / That's noise... beautiful noise!
Did you ever hear a hungry dinosaur hiccup on a windy day?
Did you ever hear a nervous butterfly nibble on a cheese soufflé?
(Carnival Music, Awful Dynne Laughs)
KAD: Ah, yes. Noise is very fashionable today!
Why I can hardly fill the orders for noise pills, racket lotion, clamor salve, and hubbub tonic!
Years ago, well everyone wanted pleasant sounds.
But today, all they want is -
(Loud Noises Coincide With Lyrics)
KAD: Crash! Bing! Bang! Boom! Ah! Plunk! Ding! Doo!
KAD: Noise, noise, nerve jangling noise,
KAD: Battering, Chattering, Shattering Noise!
KAD: Gurgles and screams, all of that stuff!
KAD: Tickle my eardrums, I can't get enough-
KAD: of that noise, noise, marvelous noise!
KAD: Horrible, hideous, awful, insidious!
KAD: Noise, noise, noise!!

Tock: Looks like a beautiful crop, doesn't it, Milo?
I've never seen fatter W's.
And those A's look delicious!
Milo: Are those letters growing on those trees?
Tock: Well, money doesn't grow on trees, does it?
Milo: No. It's just that I've never seen letters growing on trees, either.

Man: Halfbaked ideas here. Halfbaked Ideas.
Man: Meaty words here. Chops, steaks, venison.
Man: Poetic Words. Sublime words.
Man: Step right up, step right up. 
Fancy, best quality words right 'ere.
How 'bout you young man?
How 'bout a nice bag full of pronouns!
Or maybe you'd like our special assortment of adjectives. (Vendor's Voice Fades Into Background)
Milo: Boy, wait'll Ralph hears me use these!
How much are these, sir?
Vendor: And were you thinking of using all of 'em in the same sentence?
Milo: Why ye- yes, sir.
Vendor: Well, (laughing) I'll tell you what, lad.
Why don't you just take a bag full of happys and goods to start with?
Very useful for Happy Birthday, Happy New Year, happy days, and happy-go-lucky.
Useful too for good morning, good afternoon, good evening, good riddance, and goodbye!
Man: Nouns by the pound! Nouns by the pound!
Man B: Step right up, ladies and gentlemen. Do it yourself. Make up your own words. Be creative!
Have fun! Start a language!
Milo: That looks pretty difficult, Tock. 
I'm not much good at making up words.
Bee: Perhaps I can be of assistance.
Milo: Look out!
Bee: A-S-S-I-S-T-A-N-C-E
Milo: Tock, look out!
Tock: It's alright, Milo. It's just the Spelling Bee.
Bee: Yes, please don't be alarmed. A-L-A-R-M-E-D. Alarmed. I know boys are often afraid of bees.
B-E-E-S. Bees. But let me assure your my intentions are peaceful. P-E-A-C-E-F-U-L.
Milo: And you don't sting?
Bee: Sting? (Laughs). Oh I can sting, but I don't. However, I can spell anything. A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G.
Milo: Anything?
Bee: Any word that has ever been written in any language, any where.
Humbug: Balderdash. Let me repeat. Balderdash.
Bee: Balderdash?! Why you-
Humbug: Come now. Don't be ill-mannered.
Isn't someone going to introduce me to this little boy?
Fine, manly little fellow.
Bee: This is the Humbug. H-U-M-B-U-G. 
A very dislikable fellow.
Humbug: Nonsense. Everyone loves a humbug.
(Humbug Laughs). Insectious Humbugious. 
If I may use the Latin.
Bee: "Insectious Humbugious"? Why, you fraud! 
You can't even spell your own name.
Humbug: A slavish concern for the composition of words is the sign of a bankrupt intellect.
Be gone, odious wasp!
You smell of decayed syllables.
Bee: Odious wasp?! How dare you!
En garde! E-N G-A-R-D-E.

Shrift: Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty! 
I've never seen anyone so guilty.
Milo: Uh-oh.
Shrift: Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!
Just as I thought, you again!
Shrift: Guilty of sowing confusion.
Upsetting the alphabet cart.
Milo: Apple cart.
Shrift: Correcting an officer. 
Breaking havoc.
Mincing words. 
And having a dog with an unauthorized alarm.
Shrift: And illegal barking.
Shrift: I sentence you both to six million years in prison.
Milo: Six million years?
But- but only a judge can sentence you!
Shrift: Good point. (Magic Music).
I sentence you both to six million years in prison.
Shrift: Come along. I'll take you to the dungeon.
Milo: But- but you can't. I mean- only a jailer can put you in prison.
Shrift: Good point. (Magic Music).
I am also the jailer.
Come on, come on!

Bee: Be the "e" of good hope. H-O-P-E.
Shrift: You'll find it quite pleasant down here.
Milo: Isn't it a little dark?
Shrift: Of course it's dark. Dungeons are always dark. If they weren't dark, they wouldn't be so unpleasant.
Milo: But you said it would be pleasant down here.
Which-
Shrift: Precisely. Which (*Witch).
You can always chat with a Which if you get lonely.
Shrift: This is it, all the comforts of home.

Frightening Music Plays
Which: Oh, there you are! How do you do?
Milo: (hesistates) Hello.
Which: Come in, come in, come in.
Milo: You'd better be very careful, m'am.
There's a witch around here somewhere.
Which: Well, of course there is! I am she.
Faintly Macabre, the not-so-wicked Which.
There, you see? Official Which: Kingdom of Wisdom.
Milo: Oh, a Which! Like the Whether Man.
Which: Of course! The Whether Man is my brother.
At least he used to be.
I don't know whether he still is,
I haven't seen him in years!
Have a cookie.
The question marks are delicious!
Milo: What does a Which do?
Which: Well, I used to help people choose which words to use-
Which were the most proper and fitting words for any and all occasions.
But when Rhyme and Reason were banished-
Milo: Rhyme? And Reason?
Which: Yes, Milo. When the two kings had their terrible quarrel-
(Adventerous Music Begins)
Which: When King Azaz insisted that words were far more important than numbers, and hence his kingdom was truly the greater, and when Mathemagician claimed that numbers were much more important than words, and therefore his kingdom was supreme, why then naturally, they asked the Princess of Sweet Rhyme, and the Princess of Pure Reason to settle the question.
Milo: And what did they decide? What is the most important? Words or numbers?
Which: The princesses decided that words and numbers are of equal value.
Tock: In the cloak of knowledge, one is the warp and the other in the woof.
Which: But you see Milo, this decision infuriated the two kings, and they banished the princesses to the 
Castle in the Air. (Dramatic Music Plays)
And I was thrown into this dungeon.
Tock: And that's why people don't seem to care anymore which words they use, as long as they use lots of 'em.
Milo: And that's why there's no rhyme or reason around here, and everybody thinks he's so good!
Hey! Maybe we can rescue them, and rescue you too Mrs. Faintly...in about six million years.
Soldier L: Ah, there you are.
Soldier M: Where have you been?
Soldier N: Been looking all over for you.
Soldier O: Royal banquet is about to begin.
Soldier P: Soup's on.
Milo: I still have to serve my sentence of six million years in prison.
Soldier L: No time for sentences.
Soldier M: No time for words.
Soldier N: Condemn boy to hearty meal.
Soldier O: Prisons are for the birds.
Soldier P: Jailbirds.
Soldier L: Mustn't keep Azaz waiting.
Soldier M: Things get hungry, too.
Soldier N: Royal banquet's just beginning.
Soldier O: Just in time for royal stew.
Soldier P: Chow (Ciao).
Milo: Goodbye Mrs. Macabre, don't worry.
I'll find a way to rescue you.
(Cheerful Music)
Tock: Bye, Faintly. We'll be back.
Soldier: His Majesty, the Supreme Ruler of Semantics,
Most Eminent Chieftain of Participles,
Lord and Master of Words, Super Sovereign of Syntax,
Chief Potentate of Adverbs and Prepositions.
(Soldier P Whizzing to Grab Chair)
King Azaz the Unabridged.
Milo: If you please, sir.
(Azaz Bristles At "Sir")
Milo: Your majesty. My name is Milo, <br/>and this is Tock, my watchdog.
And we've been sentenced to six million years for-
Azaz: Ahhh! Six million?
That's not a sentence, that's a number.
It's against the law to mention numbers here in Dictionopolis. Words are the only things that matter.
Milo: I'm sorry your kingship, sir.
Azaz: After all, me boy-
(Singing) You couldn't have one fine day without the "day," could you?
You couldn't have tea for two without the "tea," could you?
You couldn't have three blind mice, without the "mice," could you?
So you see, Milo, words are really, very valuable things.
If you think a great thought, how do you write it down?
Words!
If you spot a brush fire, how do you warn the town?
Words!
If you have opinions, how do you speak your piece?
If you rent a castle, how do you read your lease?
If you know a good joke, how do you tell a friend?
Words, words! That's how.
Words in a word are amazing. You can read 'em, you can write 'em, you can sing 'em,
and recite 'em, underline them. Misdefine them.
They're amazing!
Words in a word are fantastic!
You can hint 'em, you can say 'em, you can print 'em, you can pray 'em.
Emphasize them and despise them. They're fantastic!
String them into sentences and thoughts profound.
We'll abound, in a symphony of spoken sound, truth is found, beauty crowned.
In other words, words in a word are delicious!
You can taste 'em, you can treat 'em, you can waste 'em, you can 'eat em.
And digest them, I suggest them!
They're delicious!
(King Sighs) Words.
 (Music Ends Dramatically)
Azaz: Speechers, speechers. Time for speeches.
You my boy, as our guest, may speak first.
Milo (clears throat): Your Majesty, uh Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity-
Azaz (claps): Enough, next.
Tock: Soup bones, dog biscuits, porter house steak, carpet slippers.
Humbug: Roast turkey, mashed potatoes, vanilla ice cream.
Soldier L: Veal Cutlet Parmesan.
Soldier M: Eggplant Florentine.
Soldier N: Eggs goldenrod.
Soldier O: Jones sausage, "reosh."
Azaz: Pate de foie gras, soupe a l'oignon, faisan sous cloche, salade endive, fromages et fruits et demi-tasse."
(Servants Marching, 
Music in Rhythm with Chewing)
Food (whispering): Your majesty, ladies and-
Milo: But that's my speech!
I didn't know I was going to have to eat my words.
King (chewing): Of- of course you do.
That's what we're all doing.
(Chews). You, you, you should have made a tastier speech.
(Gasps). I seem to have a touch of indigestion.
Milo: Perhaps you've eaten too much too quickly.
Azaz: Too be sure, too much, too quickly.
I most certainly haven't eaten too little, too slowly.
Or too much, too slowly. Or too little, too quickly.
Or taken all day to eat nothing.
Or eaten everything in no time at all.
Milo: But wouldn't that be just as bad?
Azaz: You mean just as good.
Things which are "just as bad" also are equally good.
Try to look at the bright side of things, Milo.
Milo: I don't know what side of anything to look at. 
Everything is so confusing!
And all your words only make things worse.
Azaz: How true.
Words seem to have lost their meaning.
Milo: But there must be something you can do about it.
Couldn't you pass a law- or something?
Azaz: We have almost as many laws as we have words, but the laws don't make any sense either.
Milo: Perhaps you might allow- I mean uh, because you are a wise and -and righteous and just king, you might allow...Rhyme and- and Reason to return?
Azaz: How nice that would be...
No! No, no never!
Not while that stubborn brother of mine...
(*Gently) Things always did go very well when they were here.
(*Gruffly) I won't allow it!
Milo: Why not?
Azaz: (Gently) Why not?
(Gruffly) Why not, indeed!
Azaz: (Gently) Yes. Why not? 
My boy,
I cannot tell you how it would solve all our problems, if only you could bring back Rhyme and Reason.
Bee: Odious wasp, eh? (Bee Zooms)
Bee: Didactic Drone?
Bee: Parsimonious word miser, is it?
Azaz: Perhaps someone else among my faithful court would volunteer to join this brave boy in his efforts to rescue Rhyme and Reason?
(Music of Dismay Plays)
Azaz: No volunteers?
Bee: Insectious Humbugious, ey? We'll see.
Azaz: Wonderful! A volunteer!<br/>Congratulations.
Milo: That's great! With the Humbug's help, 
I know we can do it!
Azaz: Goodbye, my boy. Here, in this bag, <br/>are all the words and ideas I know.
With them, you may ask all the questions which <br/>have never been answered.
And answer all the questions which <br/>have never been asked.
All the great books of the past, <br/>and all the ones yet to come, are in that bag.
Go now. But remember, use these words well,<br/>and there is no obstacle you cannot overcome.
Azaz: Goodbye.
Milo/Tock: Goodbye!
Milo: And thank you. Goodbye!
Azaz: Goodbye! (Music Begins)
Humbug: Owwwwww!!!!
Milo: Wow, what a mess!
How will we ever get through that?
(Music of Confidence)
(Humbug Knocks/Kicks Wood)*
Humbug: It is of no use my lad.
The wall is absolutely impenetrable.
However, your heroic effort shall not be unrewarded. 
Our eternal gratitude will be yours.
Shall we start back?
Milo: Now look here, Mr. Humbug.
If you think for one minute that-
Dodecahedron: I say young man, what seems to be your problem?
Milo: Who are you?
Dodecahedron: My angles are many, my sides are not few. I'm the Dodecahedron, and who are you?
Milo: What's a dode-kaheadrun?
Tock: As I remember it, it's a twelve-sided mathematical shape.
Dodecahedron: See for yourself. I usually use one at a time... saves wear and tear.
By the way, what was your problem?
Milo: We have to get to Digitopolis to ask the Mathema-
Dodecahedron: The only way to get there is through the Numbers Mine.
Milo: Numbers Mine? But we can't get through there.
The entrance is blocked tight.
Tock: Milo, you remember how you got us out of the Doldrums?
Milo: Yeah, maybe we can think our way through!
Dodecahedron: Can you remember any mathematics?
Milo: Let's see. Things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.
Dodecahedron: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 is known as the-
Milo: Fibonacci Series!
Dodecahedron: Vectors have both magnitude and directions...
Milo: Scalars have only magnitude!
Milo: We did it, we did it!
Humbug: (Laughs) Yes, yes.
We handled that brilliantly, my boy.
'Tis a good thing we knew the Fibonacci Series, eh?
(Laughs) Yes, ee-dee.
Milo: Golly. And I used to think numbers weren't important or valuable.
Mathemagician: Not important? Not valuable?
Humbug: It's- it's the Mathemagician.
Mathemagician: By the 4,827, 659 hairs on my head,
I'll tell you what's important.
Mathemagician (singing): You couldn't have 1 fine day without the 1, could you?
You couldn't have tea for 2 without the 2, could you?
You couldn't have 3 blind mice without the 3, so you see?
Numbers are the 4, 5, 6, 7, 8-
Wonders of the World!
If you had a big plan, how would you know how big?
Numbers!
If you had a high hope, how would you know how high? 
Numbers!
If you had a deep bog, how would you know how deep?
If you had a close call, how would you know how close?
If you had a wide choice, how would you know how wide?
Numbers! Numbers! That's how!
Numbers can be decimated, verified, manipulated, carried forward, backward, and replaced.
Numbers can be added to, subtracted from, divided into, multiplied by, crossed out, and erased.
But not with words. 
You're stuck with words.
Words are things you have to keep, have to watch, have to weigh, have to mind, have to know, have to say.
(Singing) But it's amazing what a digit or two can do.
Why anything you cannot figure out, they figure out for you.
And when troubles mount and they become too much to bear.
Never Fear.
(Talking) Just divide them and divide them.
And divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, and divide 'em, until they disappear.
Nothing counts like numbers. Numbers! 
Numbers, wonderful numbers!
Those Dewey decimal dearies, square root and mix them in series,
They give the heart inspiration, no words can bring such elation!
1 to 9, they're the most.
Pour the wine, drink a toast to-
Numbers!
(Music Ends Dramatically)
Mathemagician: Welcome to my workshop!
Humbug: Very impressive, Your Majesty.
But, could you show us the biggest number there is? <br/>Heh, heh. That will give him something to figure out.
Mathemagician: Very well, Sir Humbug.
What's the biggest number you can think of?
Humbug: 9,999,999, 000,999 and 9/10.
Mathemagician: Very good. Now add 1 to it.
Humbug: Add 1?
Mathemagician: Now add 1 to that. Add 1 again. Add 1 again. Add 1 again. Add 1 agai-
Milo: But he'd never be able to stop that way.
Mathemagician: Never. For the number you hope for is always at least one more than the one you have.
And that's so large that if you start saying it yesterday, you wouldn't finish 'til tomorrow. 
I hope that's clear to you.
Milo: Nothing's very clear to me.
Here, or in Dictionopolis.
Mathemagician: (Gruffly) Right! It's all the fault of that wretched brother of mine, King Azaz.
(Gently) Ever since the little princesses left, nothing make sense.
(Gruffly) And it's all his fault!
Milo: (clears throat) If you please sir, we'd like to rescue Rhyme and Reason.
Mathemagician: (Gruffly) Rescue Rhyme and Reason?!
(Gently) Rescue Rhyme and Reason?
What a wonderful idea!
(Gruffly) Wait, has Azaz agreed to it?
Tock: Yes sir, he has.
Mathemagician: Then I don't. We've never agreed on anything, and we never will.
Milo: And if I can prove otherwise, can we have permission to go?
Mathemagician: Of course, of course.
Milo: Very well then. Now if Azaz agrees with something, then you disagree, correct?
Mathemagician: Correct.
Milo: And anything Azaz disagrees with, you agree, is that correct?
Mathemagician: (blowing) Correct.
Milo: Then each of you agrees that he will disagree with the other, right?
Mathemagician: Right.
Milo: Then you admit that you do agree with Azaz about something. You agree about disagreeing!
(Surprised Music)
Mathemagician: I've been tricked!
Mathemagician: Again, I want to thank you for showing me how foolish and stupid I've been.
But this gift can supply you with all the numbers, theorems, equations, and mathematical ideas the world has ever known, or ever will know.
Use it well, and there is nothing it can't do for you.
Milo: Thank you!
Mathemagician: Goodbye and good luck.
Milo: Goodbye.
Mathemagician: Goodbye.
Milo: Goodbye!
Milo: Tock, look! 
Is that a demon?
Humbug: Quick, let's go back!
Tock: No, no, no. That's the man I told you about.
That's Chroma the Great.
The one sane man left in this country.
Milo: You mean the one who conducts rainbows, and sunrises and sunsets and things?
Tock: Right. We're lucky. It looks like he's ready to conduct today's sunset. Watch!

Milo: That was a very beautiful sunset, sir.
Chroma: Why, thank you my boy. 
I've only been practicing since the world began.
Sometime, I'll get it just right.
Milo: I thought it was perfect.
Chroma: You ought to see my lightning, and fireworks!
Chroma: (Yawns) Well, good night my boy.
Oh, don't forget to wake me at 5:23, for the sunrise.
Oh. I really, really must get some sleep.
Tock (loud whisper): Milo, Milo! 
Come on, we're wasting time.
Milo (loud whisper): I can't! I have to wake 
Chroma for the sunrise.
Humbug (loud whisper): Why don't you conduct the sunrise yourself, Milo?
(Humbug Laughs Menacingly to Himself)
Humbug (loud whisper): Save us a lot of time!
And you won't have to disturb Chroma- at all!
Milo: Hey, that's a great idea, I'll do it!
Tock: Why, you fool! What did you tell him to do that for? 
Do you know what trouble he can-
(Conductor's Baton Raps on Music Stand)
Tock: No, Milo. No!
(Frightening Music Begins)
Tock (slow, warped voice): Oh no.
Tock: Come on, come on! We have to get out of here <br/>before Chroma wakes up.
(Warped Time is a Gift Music Plays)
Milo: Now there's no sense any place. 
And it's all my fault.
Senses Taker: Names? I must have your names before you can proceed.
Milo: Well uh, this is the Humbug.
Senses Taker: Humbug.
Milo: This is Tock.
Senses Taker: Tock.
Milo: And my name is Milo. Now can we go?
Senses Taker: Milo. <br/>Ooh...I haven't had an "M" in ages.
Now then, if you'll just tell me: when you were born; where you were born; why you we born; how old you are; how old you were then; <br/>what grade you're in;
Your shoe size; shirt size; <br/>collar size; hat size; and the names and bank references of six people who can verify this information- then you can go.
Milo: What do you need all this for?
We're in a hurry.
Senses Taker: I'm the official Senses (*Census) Taker. I must have this information before I take your senses.
So now, if you will fill out in triplicate: your height; your weight; how many ice cream cones you eat in a week; how many you don't eat in a week;
Senses Taker: how many you would like-
Milo: We can't waste the time. We've got to get to the
Milo: Castle in the Air! 
Senses Taker: That does it! Now I'm going to take your sense of duty, your sense of precaution,
(Menancing Voice) and especially, your sense of direction.
Tock: Milo! The bottle of laughter! Use this bottle of laughter I got from Dr. Dischord.
He can't take away our sense of humor!
(Bottle Pops Open,
Laughing Begins in Car)
Senses Taker: (Gruffly) Stop That!
Senses Taker: (Laughs) Stop that, stop that at - 
(Laughs) at- at once.
Senses Taker (Laughing): Stop...stop. 
Woooo! Heee!
Terrible Trivium: Hello, little boy.
Milo (breathing heavily): Huh?
Terrible Trivium: Welcome to you, your faithful dog, and that handsome gentleman.
I'm so terribly happy to see all of you. <br/>But before you travel on,
I wonder if you could spare me a little time, <br/>and assist me with a few trivial tasks.
Humbug: Why of course!<br/>We're in no hurry.
Tock (whispering): Don't do it, Milo.
Milo: But Tock, we need all the friends we can get up here! Besides, it's only for a little while.
Terrible Trivium: Now young man, if you will take those exquisite tweezers, and move this pile of sand from here to here.
Milo: With these?!
Terrible Trivium: Of course.
And you sir, have the privilege of taking this delicate needle and digging a hole through this cliff.
Humbug: Why, thank you, sir! <br/>An exacting assignment, quite worthy of my talents.
I shall enjoy it to no end.
Tock (whispering): Don't be a fool, bug! <br/>I think this bird is the Terrible Tri-
Terrible Trivium: And you sir, get to take this eyedropper, and empty that well.
Milo: But these tasks don't seem very important.
Terrible Trivium: Of course they're not important.
If you always do the easy and useless jobs, you'll never have to worry about the important ones.
Humbug: Right.
Tock: Now I know who you are, <br/>you're the Terrible Trivium!
Terrible Trivium: Quite correct.
The Terrible Trivium, demon of petty tasks and worthless jobs. Ogre of wasted effort.
Milo: Come on, Humbug! Let's get outta here!
Terrible Trivium: And friend to lazy <br/>and foolish people everywhere.

Intriguing Jazzy Music Plays
Terrible Trivium: Come back, come back!
There are so many things to take away, and things to bring back.
Humbug: So many stamps to lick, <br/>so many pencils to sharpen.
Terrible Trivium: There are so many holes to dig,
Humbug: So many nails to straighten,
Terrible Trivium: so many doodles to doodle.
Humbug: so many goofs to off.
Terrible Trivium: Come back! <br/>There are so many useless things yet to do.
Humbug: There are strings to tie, nits to pick, <br/>fingernails to bite, paperclips to unbend-
(Gasps) -Lives to save!
Demon of Insincerity: Run, run, he's still after us. This way, this way, hurry. I'm your friend. Up here, quickly!
I'll help ya! Good, good, straight ahead. <br/>Hurry! You're doing great.
Tock: Yeow!
Insincerity: Mwhahaha! Trapped ya, didn't I?
I'm the long-nosed, green-eyed, curly haired, wide-mouthed, bowlegged, big-footed monster.
And if I do say so myself, I'm one of the most dreaded fiends in the whole wide wilderness! Bwhahaha!
Humbug: It sounds like we're doomed.
Milo: "Sounds" is right.<br/>If there's one thing I've learned around here, it's that people aren't always what they say they are.
Insincerity: With awful hideous me here, you wouldn't dare try to escape. Bwhahaha!
Why I'll tear anyone apart that tries to get out of there.
For I'm the long-nosed, green-eyed, curly-haired,<br/>wide-mouthed, thick-necked, broad-shouldered, roundbodied, short-armed, bowlegged, big-footed monster. One false move and I'll...(looks at Milo)
I"ll..I- I'll, I'll chew up the lot of ya. I'll rip ya to ribbons. 
I'll turn ya to hamburger, I'll- I'll,
(Discouraged) Actually, I'm the Demon of Insincerity.
I don't mean what I say. I don't mean what I do. <br/>I- I'm just mean, I guess.
Now you had to go and spoil everything!
Humbug: Well, if he's typical of the monsters around here, we have nothing to worry about.
Tock: It's the Gelatinous Giant!
Gelatinous Giant (Booming Voice): And what have we here? Aha! I see! Breakfast.
Milo: Wait! I have a better idea.
Gelatinous Giant: An Idea? Ahh. <br/>If there is one thing I can't swallow, it's an idea.
Milo: Well, it just so happens that I have a bag full of all the ideas in the world right here.
Gelatinous Giant: No. No, no, no! Don't open it! 
Leave well enough alone.
Don't take chances. <br/>Keep things as they are.
Changes are so... frightening. No...new...ideas.
Milo: Tock, Humbug, look!
Milo: The Castle in the Air. 
At last, we've made it! We've made it!
Humbug: Yahaha! Vic-tory! 
Haha! Victory at last.
Tock: We've done it! <br/>Humbug: Perseverance Prevailed!
Milo: No problems, clear sailing!

Humbug: (laughing nervously) 
Wha- Wha- What are we going to do now?
Milo: Do? Why we're going to make a stand right here.
(Menacing Music Plays)
Humbug: I think jumping might be safer.
Milo: King Azaz and the Mathemagician said there's nothing I can't do if I use words and numbers right.
And I have a hunch if I use 'em together, <br/>that I can do anything. Now, who's first?
Tock: There's the Hideous Two-Faced Hypocrite.
Milo: Two-Faced Hypocrite. Hmm, let's see.
V for victory over a Two-Faced Hypocrite.
Now, if you take away the two faces, that leaves V/(h).
Forthright. This should be the answer.
All we need is a 4.
Humbug: Well done, my boy. Well done. <br/>If there's one thing I can't abide, it's a hypocrite.
Tock: Milo, quick! <br/>It's the Overbearing Know-it-all.
Overbearing Know-it-all: You should have stayed home <br/>and minded your own business.
You'll never listen to your betters.<br/>I tried to tell you, but oh no.
(Snarles). Heh-heh, 
I'm always right about these things.
Milo: I think I know just the word for him. Humility. <br/>This should do the job nicely.
Overbearing Know-it-all: i told you! I told you!
Terrible Trivium: There are so many things to take away, and things to bring back.
So many holes to dig, so many doodles to doodle, <br/>so many useless things yet to do.

Please tick or something.
He's not ticking! <br/>Oh Humbug, his main spring's broken.
He stopped ticking. You'll have to watch him now. <br/>I've to get Rhyme and Reason.
Humbug: Hurry, Milo. Hurry!
Reason: Welcome, Milo, to the Castle in the Air.
Milo: But- but how do you know who I am? <br/>And I mean, are you the princesses?
Reason: Yes, my dear. <br/>This is my sister, the Princess of Sweet Rhyme.
And I am called the Princess of Pure Reason.
Rhyme: And as for knowing who you are, why- we sent for you.
Milo: Se- Sent for me?
Rhyme: Yes. You see Milo, we had to find a boy <br/>who was so bored he would go anywhere and do almost anything to get away from it all. Only such a boy could rescue us.
Reason: But he also had to have courage. And curiosity. 
And kindness. That's why we chose you.
Milo: But you don't know! I've made so many mistakes! <br/>I've messed up the whole sky and I've-
Rhyme: Never feel badly about making mistakes.
Reason: Because often you'll learn more by being wrong for the right reasons-
Rhyme: than you do by being right <br/>for the wrong reasons.
Milo: What about Tock? He's broken! Or dead, or rundown. Or whatever watchdogs do.
We've gotta help him!
Reason: We can help everyone now, Milo.
Milo: You mean now that King Azaz and the Mathemagician have agreed to disagree-
Rhyme: Yes, Milo. Now that you have helped them to understand how foolish they were to disagree at all.
Milo: But how can we get down? 
The stairway is gone!
Rhyme: I think you mean, "whether" we can get down, don't you, Milo?
Because, unless I'm mistaken, <br/>here comes your old friend the Whether Man.
Whether Man: Well now, well now, well now, if it isn't the little boy who got lost trying to find his way.
Expect everything I always say, and the unexpected never happens. Eh, but never mind that.
What you really need now is a "how," isn't it? <br/>And perhaps a- a "here" to go with it.
With a "here's how," you can do anything!
Oh, and it's also an excellent way of getting from one place to another.
Milo: Here's how.

1969 MGM Theme Plays
His name was J.B. Books,
and he had a matched pair of. 45s
with antique ivory grips
that were something to behold...
but he wasn't an outlaw.
Fact is, for a while,
he was a lawman.
Long before I met Mr. Books, he was a famous man.
I guess his fame was why somebody or other
was always after him.
The wild country had taught him to survive.
Hyah!
He lived his life and herded by himself.
He had a credo that went...
I won't be wronged. I won't be insulted.
I won't be laid a hand on.
I don't do these things to other people.
I require the same from them.
You hold it right there.
Give me your wallet.
Take it a little easy with that cannon, mister.
Just throw me your wallet.
Yes, sir, and a little something extra.
You done murdered me.
No, but you're going to have a long winter bellyache, you boob.
Give me that wallet.
Just the wallet.
I can hardly move.
You done shot a hole in my stomach.
I appreciate that.
You ain't going to leave me here.
Well, it's quite obvious that's what you were going to do to me.
Get out of the way.
Mister, you better find yourself another line of work.
This one sure don't fit your pistol.
Hey, mister, want a paper?
Yeah, I will, son.
Queen Victoria's dead.
There you are.
Thank you.
Whoa.
Hey!
Hey, you!
Hey, Methuselah, move that cack out of the way.
Are you talking to me?
Yeah, you dumb bastard.
Move it, or I'll deliver you something to remember me by.
Well, now, pardon me all to hell.
Giddyup!
Buster.
Whoa.
Try it.
Come on, Jay, the old man ain't worth the bullet.
He looks all tuckered out.
Giddyup.
You're right there, son.
Doc Hostetler.
John Bernard Books.
You remembered.
The newspapers occasionally remind me.
Wh-What was it,
15 years ago?
The only time
I was ever hit...
Right here at the Acme Saloon.
You killed two men.
I'm damn lucky you were around.
That second one nearly did me in, coming out of nowhere like that.
You must have the constitution of an ox.
Well, we'll see.
That's what
I'm here for.
Oh?
About 10 days ago in Creede, Colorado,
I hadn't been feeling up to snuff, so I went to see a sawbones there.
He, uh...
Well, the next day
I got on my horse and took off to find you.
And what did my colleague in Creede say?
Examine me, and I'll tell you.
You don't trust me.
Oh, Doc, you saved my life.
You don't trust my profession.
In my profession, you trust too much, you don't celebrate many birthdays.
I kind of like it around here.
All right,
I'll examine you.
Take your clothes off down to your long johns.
Now, I, uh... if I'm to know what to look for, you'll have to tell me what's ailing you.
Well, I hurt, Doc, way down deep in my back.
Not all the time, but now and then suddenly.
Pain in the lumbar vertebrae?
Like sin.
All right, whenever you get ready, just... bend over the table there, trapdoor down.
Well?
Books, every few days
I have to tell a man or a woman something
I don't want to.
I've been practicing medicine for 29 years, and I still don't know how to do it well.
Why don't you just say it flat out?
All right.
You have a cancer... advanced.
Is that what that fella up at Creede told you?
Yeah.
And you didn't believe him.
No.
Do you believe me?
Can't you cut it out, Doc?
I'd have to gut you like a fish.
Well, what can you do?
There's... just, uh... very little
I can do.
Uh, if... when the pain gets too bad,
I can give you something.
What you're trying to tell me is that I...
Yeah.
Damn.
I'm sorry, Books.
You told me I was strong as an ox.
Well, even an ox dies.
How much time do I have?
Two months... six weeks... less.
There's no way to tell.
Well, what can I...
What will I be able to do?
Oh, anything you want at first.
Then, later on, you won't want to.
How much later?
You'll know when.
You'll have to get off your feet and get some rest.
Have you made any kind of arrangements for a room?
No. I just got in town.
You might try the widow Rogers.
She's got a place down the street a fair piece.
She takes in lodgers.
She's a nice woman.
She needs the help.
I'll give it a try.
Do me a favor.
Don't tell anybody
I'm in town.
Oh, no, but if I wanted to go unnoticed,
I don't think I'd walk around with this thing.
Stole it from a whorehouse in Creede.
Did you?
Hello.
This the Rogers place?
Yeah.
Ma!
You can tell your mother that a tuckered-out old man needs a room.
Good afternoon, sir.
Afternoon.
Doc Hostetler says you might be able to help me.
How kind of him.
Yes, sir, I have one room available.
Good.
Downstairs in the rear.
$8.00 by the week.
$2.00 per day if you're not permanent.
Well, I'm not permanent, ma'am.
Oh, boy, get my gear and the saddlebags off that horse and bring them into the house.
Gillom will be happy to do that.
The parlor is yours to use and the telephone.
My other lodgers have rooms upstairs.
Two railroad men and a schoolteacher.
I'll introduce them at supper.
My kitchen.
And the bathroom.
I thought that's what it was.
We do have running water, also in the washbowl in here.
Nice-looking brass bed.
I hope it hasn't got any, uh...
It isn't ticky, is it?
It certainly is not.
This is very comfortable.
I'll take my meals right here.
I serve in the dining room.
I'll pay you extra.
Very well, since you're not permanent.
This suit's got a lot of countryside on it.
I'd like to have it brushed before morning.
I'll take those saddlebags.
That bedroll you can leave outside.
I have my things wrapped in it.
They'll need soap and water.
Have you a barn?
No, we don't.
Boy, take my horse over...
My name's Gillom.
It's not "boy. "
It's Gillom Rogers, and I don't like being ordered around.
Well, that's fair enough,
Gillom Rogers.
Would you be so kind as to take Old Dollar over to the livery stable and see that he gets a double order of oats?
O.K.
You seem to be a man accustomed to giving orders.
I guess it is a bad habit of mine.
I didn't get your name.
I didn't give it.
Is it so important?
For anyone living under my roof, it is.
Well, all right.
It's, uh... Hickok,
William Hickok.
Where do you hail from,
Mr. Hickok?
Abilene, Kansas.
And what do you do there?
I'm a U.S. Marshal.
Oh, that's nice.
No, it isn't.
I'm glad you're not staying long, Mr. Hickok.
I'm not sure
I like you.
Not many do,
Mrs. Rogers.
Moses, where did you hide the whiskey this time?
Third drawer from the left, Gilly boy.
Gilly, fetch me my spectacles.
What the hell are you doing?
You watch your language, boy.
J.B. Books is in my house.
Hey.
My name is Books.
Y'all get that?
Bang!
Boom!
He's in my house.
Ma!
Ma, I got to tell you something.
Shh. Close the door.
What's happened?
Who do you think...
Oh, Gillom, you've been drinking again.
Do you know who he is?
William Hickok...
United States Marshal in Abilene, Kansas.
Ma,
Wild Bill Hickok was shot before I was born.
We got
J.B. Books here.
He's killed 30 men.
Gillom, go to your room.
Go on. Go to bed before you wake the house.
Good night, Ma.
Whoo.
Come in.
Mr. Books?
Oh, my clothes.
Thank you, m...
You are J.B. Books.
That's right.
May I ask how you found out?
My son.
I've been up all night because of you.
I demand that you pack and leave.
That is not possible.
And why not?
I don't propose to say.
So you won't go.
No.
And that's your last word?
Mrs. Rogers, you have a fine color when you're on the scrap.
Central, give me the city marshal's office.
Thank you.
Come in, Marshal.
My name's Thibido,
Marshal
Walter Thibido.
I'm told... you are J.B. Books.
You were told right.
Have a seat.
Don't think I will.
Breathe easy, Marshal.
You're closer to your gun than I am to mine.
Books, Carson City's full of hard cases...
Is your head cold?
Huh?
Oh.
Books, Carson City's full of hard cases who'd sell their souls to put your name on the wall.
You'll draw trouble like an outhouse draws flies.
I checked my bulletins before I come over and didn't find nothing
I can hold you for, but I want you out of town... directly, today.
Maybe I'm not so inclined.
Then, by God,
I will incline you.
I can badge as many men as I need.
We'll smoke you out or carry you out feet first, so you say which,
Mr. Gunman.
It's your funeral.
Soon, yes.
Huh?
I can't go.
Can't?
I'm going to die right here in this room.
Ha! That's too thin.
I wish you were right.
Would you believe
Doc Hostetler?
That's his verdict.
You don't say?
You don't sa... goddamn!
Whoo!
Whooee!
I tell you the truth...
Coming through that door,
I was scared.
I know what a man like you is capable of.
I wondered who'd get my job, if the council would give my wife a pension, and if it would snow the day they put me under.
Excuse me if I don't pull a long face.
You talk too much.
Much as I damn please.
How long does
Hostetler give you?
He doesn't know.
Do me a favor.
I owe you one... or Hostetler.
My being here... maybe that's news, but dying is my own business.
Keep it under your hat, will you?
Just don't take too long to die.
Be a gent and convenience everybody and do it soon.
You've worn out your welcome.
Scat.
The day they lay you away, what I'll do on your grave won't pass for flowers.
You damn little sneak.
How long were you there?
I was just passing by.
You spy on me, and I'll nail you to a tree.
You've told your mother.
Who else have you blabbed to?
Jay Cobb.
Are you all right,
Mr. Books?
I can't abide a skulker.
You want to see me, knock on my door like a man.
Sure you're all right?
If there's anything
I can do for you, just let me know.
It's an honor to have you in this house.
Your mother doesn't agree.
She doesn't know how a man feels.
You're the most famous person ever in this town.
When I was a boy,
I heard about your shootout at the Acme Saloon.
I never thought
I'd meet you.
There's more to being a man than handling a gun.
Don't you have something to do?
I was just headed over to
Cobb's Creamery right now.
I help Jay with deliveries sometimes.
That was the nice gentleman you were with yesterday.
Where's your mother?
She's in the kitchen,
I think.
Well, goodbye, sir.
It was real nice meeting you.
Good-bye.
Mrs. Rogers, I, uh... hope you'll forgive me for taking Hickok's name.
I thought it was pretty funny at the time, but after reflection... it wasn't such a joke, and I apologize.
You should.
The only way you can show your repentance is to leave.
Well, that
I cannot do.
Mr. Books, you are a notorious individual utterly lacking in character or decency.
You're an assassin.
That's according to which end of the gun you're on.
You lied to me, made a fool of me.
This house is all I have.
If my lodgers find out who you are, they'll leave.
I have a cancer.
I'm dying of it.
I know what you'll be thinking...
That I'll be a lot of trouble.
Well, I won't.
You just bring me my meals, and I'll see to the other needs.
I promise you
I won't be a burden.
Mrs. Rogers, I'm in a kind of a tight...
I'll make it worth your while.
I can pay $4.00 a day for the room.
Oh, Mr. Books.
Most pleased to meet you, sir, and honored.
What did you want to see me about?
The name is Dan Dobkins.
I'm with
The Morning Appeal.
Mr. Dobkins, sit down.
Thank you.
Um... we ran the story this morning that you were here at Mrs. Rogers' and enjoying our salubrious winter climate and so on and so forth.
Have you seen it?
No.
It's page one,
I assure you.
I bought your paper when I arrived.
Still reading about
Queen Victoria dying.
Oh.
What can I do for you?
That's what
I came to discuss.
Well, that's what I figured.
You must appreciate, sir, that you are the most celebrated shootist extant.
Extant?
Uh, still existing, alive.
Thank you.
Yes, and your reputation is nationwide.
My story went out over the wires this morning.
Every daily of consequence will run it, but they'll want more, the papers in the East, in particular.
Between us, Mr. Books, we can really put
Carson City on the map.
Mr. Dobkins, you're going the long way around the barn.
Yes, sir.
I would like tremendously to do a series of stories on you.
A series?
Yes. Uh, how long will you be with us?
Not as long as I'd like to be.
Oh, well, we could start today, right now, then get together again tomorrow.
You see, there's been so much cheap fiction about gunmen.
I want to get down to the true story for once, while you're available, before anything happens to you.
I mean,
I hope nothing does.
Go on.
I want to cover your career factually.
The statistics, you might say.
Then I'd delve into the psychological aspects...
What turned you to violence in the first place?
Are you by nature bloodthirsty?
Uh, do you, uh, brood after the deed is done, or have you lived so long with death that you're used to it?
The death of others?
The prospect of your own?
Make like that's a nipple.
One fit or fidget and Mrs. Rogers is going to be scrubbing your brains off the wallpaper.
On your feet.
Back up.
Now, we're heading for the front door.
Now, don't you shake, shiver, or sneeze.
Mr. Books, what in heaven's name are you doing?
Ma'am, we have a touchy situation here.
Out.
Turn around.
Mmm.
Turn around.
Bend over.
Yes, sir.
Dobkins, you are a prying, pipsqueaking ass, and if you ever come dandying around here again...
That was a savage thing to do.
Maybe...
Mr. Books?
I'll tend myself.
First things first, Doc.
I almost forgot to ask you.
How much do I owe you?
You're a man after my own heart, Books.
Most of them ask that last, if at all.
Well, let's see.
We'll make it $4.00 for the two visits plus $ 1.00 for that.
What's that?
They call that laudanum, a solution of opium and alcohol.
Opium, that can get to be a habit.
Why, absolutely, an addiction.
How does it taste?
Just... just awful, terrible, but it's the most potent painkiller we've got.
How much of it do I take?
Well, as much as you need when you need it.
I think a spoonful would be all right to start with.
Later?
I don't know, but I... I think one morning you're just going to wake up and say,
"Here I am in this bed, and here I'm going to stay. "
Hostetler,
I want to know.
Well, unless you insist,
I'd rather not talk about it.
Well, I want to know.
All right.
There'll be an increase in the severity of the pain in your lower spine, your hips, your groin.
You...
Do you... Do you want me to go on?
The pain will become unbearable.
Uh, no drug will moderate it.
If you're lucky, you'll lose consciousness, and until then, you'll scream.
L- I... I'm sorry.
L... I didn't mean to be specific like this.
The next time,
I'll go to Mrs. Rogers.
You... You...
You just telephone.
You just telephone.
There... There's one more thing I'd say.
Both of us have had a lot to do with death.
I'm not a brave man, but you must be.
Ah.
Now-now-now, this is not advice.
It's not even a suggestion.
It's just something for you to reflect on while your mind's still clear.
What?
I would not die a death like I just described.
No?
Not if I had your courage.
Oh.
Thanks.
Come in, Mrs. Rogers.
Oh, Mr. Books, I...
I'm beginning to know your knock.
I was reading about old Queen Vic.
Well, maybe she outlived her time.
Maybe she was a museum piece, but she never lost her dignity nor sold her guns.
She hung on to her pride and went out in style.
That's the kind of an old gal I'd like to meet.
Mrs. Rogers, are you afraid of me?
Well, to be frank, yes.
Why?
All these guns and the kind of man you are.
Maybe you're afraid of too many things.
Sometimes widows are, but I'm sure there's plenty of starch in your corset.
Mr. Books, I came here to see what you can eat, if you can have what I'm serving.
No, you didn't.
I wish you'd stop contradicting me.
I wish you'd say what you mean.
Very well.
I apologize for the unchristian things
I've said and done.
I'm sorry, and I'll do whatever I can for you.
Well, thank you. I...
All my life,
I've been too proud to take help from anyone.
Guess I'll have to learn.
Would you, uh... sit down for a moment?
Please do.
What's that?
Laudanum.
Doc Hostetler's remedy.
That's habit-forming, isn't it?
Mrs. Rogers, would you go for a drive in the country with me tomorrow?
Oh, I... I couldn't, but thank you.
I wish you'd reconsider.
It would only be for an hour or two.
No. I appreciate the invitation, but no.
Is it that you don't want to be alone with me?
It's not that,
I assure you.
It's just that I've only been a widow for a year.
People would...
People!
If I have to work on your sympathy, I will.
I want to go out in the world again and see trees, lakes, hills, and the sky.
And I don't fancy seeing it alone.
I've been full of alone lately.
I'm sorry.
Besides, there's a threat of snow in the air.
Since I moved in here, we've been scratching at each other and apologizing.
Well, let's see if we can't do better.
Damn it. I wish to hell you'd ride with me.
I apologize for my language.
I'll go with you.
Good.
Tomorrow at 10:00?
Will you get, please,
Mr. Gillom Rogers to trot down to the stable and get us the best horse and buggy they have?
I will.
I'm much obliged, ma'am.
Good evening.
Deuce is the dead card.
8 is your winner, and the lovely queen, the loser.
Hellfire!
That makes seven turnovers in a row.
Pulford,J.B. Books over at Mrs. Rogers.
That was yesterday's news.
But I just heard he's dying.
Dying?
Friend of mine got it from Marshal Thibido.
Old Books is cashing in.
That's hard news.
That's a man
I could have taken.
Ha!
My ass.
You have two ways of leaving this establishment, my friend...
Immediately or dead.
Gentlemen, place your bets.
Place your bets, gentlemen.
Look out!
Clean through the heart!
Hey, Pulford!
Over 80 feet!
- Hooray!
- Hooray!
Oh, mighty handsome, ma'am.
Moses had to dust this buggy off.
He says he don't rent it too often.
Doesn't.
Except just for funerals.
Well, thank you, Gillom.
I appreciate this.
I want that wood chopped by the time we get back.
Oh, Ma, I was going to go on...
Yes, ma'am.
Hyah.
That is beauty.
It is a little chilly up here.
Would you like the top raised?
No, thank you.
You all right?
I will be in a minute.
Can I help you?
I've had plenty of practice.
Why don't you get married again?
What?
I think you heard me.
That's none of your affair.
I haven't time to be polite, Mrs. Rogers.
Well, for one thing,
I haven't been asked.
For another,
I loved my husband and still do.
How did he die?
Stroke, they think.
They found him slumped at his desk.
He was lucky.
He was 41.
Did he have time to, uh...
Did he leave you any security?
I have the property and the house, which he built with a bank loan, and Gillom.
And he worries you.
Yeah, he certainly does, particularly when he complains about being bored and needing excitement.
Well, I wouldn't be too hard on him.
Every young man feels the need to let the badger loose now and again.
I try to reason with him. I can't.
I can only mother him.
That's not what he wants.
Like I said, that you can change.
Don't you have enough worries of your own?
A few, but in general,
I've had a hell of a good time.
Tell me, um... what does the J.B.
Stand for?
John Bernard.
And yours?
Bond.
That's a crackerjack of a name for a woman.
How do you do, Bond?
How do you do,
John Bernard?
Shall we?
Hyah!
Good morning,
Mrs. Rogers!
Mr. Sweeney.
Mike Sweeney?
John Bernard Books, now, I'm flattered that you remembered me.
You live around here now?
My spread's in the foothills to the west.
Well, you look just like
I remember the Sweeneys... mean and ugly.
Well, I heard that you were in town for a very short time.
That's true.
Drop by.
We'll talk about old times.
The good old times.
Ha ha ha!
You can bring your fancy pillow, and your landlady is welcome, too.
Now, my problem is that she never accepts my invitation, and to you two,
I say good-bye.
I'm surprised at the company you keep.
That man is no friend.
Quite the reverse.
How do you know him?
I don't.
I had some dealings with his brother Albert once.
What happened?
Oh.
That's what worries me,
John Bernard... the thought of your victims.
What worried me was survival.
Bond, I don't believe
I ever killed a man that didn't deserve it.
Surely, only the Lord can judge that.
Mr. Books!
Mr. Books?
Sir?
Are you hurt?
No.
But they are.
Call the marshal.
He got both of them.
They came in through the windows... guns blazing.
Close your robe.
He's so damn fast, he killed them both.
John Bernard Books in a shootout right here.
Son of a bitch!
I will not have that language in my house.
Sorry, but this is a great day.
Our house is a part of history.
You've got to know that.
That's nothing to be proud of.
I love that old man.
Gillom! All right!
It's time you knew.
He's dying.
Who?
Mr. Books.
I don't believe it.
He has a cancer.
You're lying.
He would have told me.
But he didn't tell you!
He told me.
He's dying.
Ma.
Ma.
You do understand?
That's the last of it.
Thank you,
Mr. Hutchins.
My position as a teacher, as a maiden lady,
I'm obliged to move to another place.
Of course.
I apologize.
We're ready to go!
Bye.
Some coffee?
Don't mind if I do.
Did you know those two?
Nope.
They sure knew you.
Who were they?
Ben Shoup, the one you killed trying to get out the window.
The other named Norton...
Two no-goods, not from around here.
I've never heard of them.
Quite a night.
Your bedroom looks like a slaughterhouse.
Oh, Mrs. Rogers.
I'll post a man outside nights.
That'll cost the taxpayers
$3.00 a night and $ 10 apiece to plant two corpses.
Death and taxes,
Books.
Keeping you alive to die natural is costing us a pretty penny.
There's no need of any man outside.
I'd appreciate that,
Marshal.
Thank you.
L... I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened last night.
That won't help.
Two men are dead.
I was defending myself.
How are you feeling, a little more poorly every day?
You've got a streak of kindness a mile wide.
That I do.
Tell you what...
Maybe I can help speed things along.
Did you read about the shooting the night before last?
No.
Whooee! That was some shooting.
Pulford, he's the faro dealer, got off one round under fire, straight through the heart, and it measured 84'3".
Maybe I'll just send him here, let him deal you a little faro.
You do that,
Marshal.
This is 19-aught-1.
The old days are gone.
You don't know it.
We've got waterworks, telephones, lights.
We'll have our streetcar electrified by next year, and we've started to pave the streets.
We've still got some weeding to do.
Once we're rid of people like you, we'll have a goddamn
Garden of Eden here.
To put it in a nutshell, you've plain plumb outlived your time.
You couldn't put it in a barrel without a bottom.
You're the longest-winded bastard I ever listened to.
I may be windy, but I ain't ornery.
When my time comes to die,
I won't drag it out.
I'll just do it.
Why don't you?
Thibido...
I don't scare anymore.
Neither did Shoup or Norton.
You wouldn't gun down a police officer.
What'd stop me, fear of dying?

# Lies amolderin' in his grave #

# Lies amolderin' in his grave #
# But his horse keeps #
# Gallopin' on ##
Moses?
Would you care to do business with a voice from the grave?
Mr. Books!
It's pure pleasure to groom your horse!
And even a greater pleasure to do business with you!
Would you kindly step into my office?
Lt'll be a pleasure.
Right this way, please.
Yes, sir.
Now, let me see where I put my spectacles because I wouldn't want to make no, uh... financial mistake.
Yes, sir.
Here they are, Mr. Books.
That's a lot of money, Moses.
Who do I have...
What's this for?
What's it for?
For your horse.
My horse? I want to sell my horse, but this wouldn't buy my saddle.
But, Mr. Books, you done agreed.
When?
When you sent Gilly...
I mean, when Mr. Rogers said this morning
$ 100 would be just fine with you.
I'll have to have a talk with Mr. Rogers.
As far as the horse goes, it's 3.
I might maybe can go 200.
You might maybe go more than that
'cause you'll get more than that 'cause it's mine.
3, and I'll throw the saddle in for cash.
What about my bill?
You throw that in.
I ain't made of money.
Are we going to stand here and haggle all day?
Mr. Books, you the most famous man I ever seen and the second-best haggler.
Who's the best?
Here I stand.
Well, let's get to haggling.
Let's get to haggling.
All right.
Let's get to haggling.
That's 200. 200.
200 there.
No.
No.
Sold.
You mean I did it?
Mr. Books, that makes me the best haggler!
The best in the world, Moses.
Yes, sir.
Gillom!
Gillom!
Where's Gillom?
In the woodshed.
That's appropriate.
Why?
You stay out of this.
Gillom!
I'm in here.
You'll account to me.
Sir?
You were trying to cheat me, and Moses was trying to cheat you.
I'm sorry.
I'm glad of that, but it doesn't... it doesn't tell me very much.
She, uh...
She cried on my shoulder this morning on account of you.
I had to comfort her.
And then the lodgers moved out.
Your room is a mess... and now Ma's worried about losing the house.
Well, I just thought that... that maybe you might want to do something to try and make it up to her.
I thought you might be interested in selling your horse since you're...
Since I'm what?
You're dying.
How did you find that out?
Ma told me.
Guess I'm the last one in town to know about it.
Don't you think you should have talked to me before you tried to sell my horse?
Yes, sir.
I suppose.
But I just wanted to see first if Moses would buy it, that's all.
I'm not a horse thief.
A man's emotions can... tangle him all up sometimes.
I've been operating on the raw edge lately, Gillom.
Guess I just jumped too far too fast.
But, son, I never thought you were a horse thief.
And I hope I can hang around long enough to make it up to you.
Sir... do you think...
Would you give me a shooting lesson?
A shooting lesson?
Well, a man should know how to handle a gun, use it with discretion.
But, uh... you going to tell your mother?
Well... do I have to?
Come on, I'll get us something to shoot with.
It's beautiful.
See that tree on the left with the divided trunk?
You take the right side.
Aim well and put five slugs in it.
Why not six?
You keep your hammer on an empty chamber for safety.
And if you're going out to face somebody?
Load six if your insides tells you to.
Now, take your time.
That's good shooting,
Gillom.
Hey, Mr. Books, my spread's not much bigger than yours.
You did well.
Where did you learn to shoot like that?
Jay Cobb lets me practice with him by the lake... when he's not in jail.
Day before yesterday, he smashed some salesman's jaw.
Nice employer you have.
Well, it's just temporary... till I find whatever's right for me.
Yeah.
Wouldn't I like to see him and Jack Pulford go at it.
Did you hear about what Pulford did?
I did.
Mr. Books.
Yeah?
How did you ever kill so many men?
I lived most of my life in the wild country, and you set a code of laws to live by.
What laws?
I won't be wronged,
I won't be insulted,
I won't be laid a hand on.
I don't do these things to other people, and I require the same from them.
But how could you get into so many fights and always come out on top?
I nearly tied you shooting.
There's nobody up there shooting back at you.
It isn't always being fast or even accurate that counts.
It's being willing.
I found out early that most men, regardless of cause or need, aren't willing.
They blink an eye or draw a breath before they pull the trigger.
I won't.
Bat Masterson told Cobb...
Bat Masterson?
Yeah.
He says that a man has to have, uh... guts, deliberation, and a proficiency with firearms.
Did he mention that third eye you better have?
Third eye?
For that dumb-ass amateur.
It's usually some six-fingered bustard that couldn't hit a cow in the tit with a tin cup that does you in.
But then,
Bat Masterson always was full of sheep dip.
Whoa. I hope you're smart enough to know that that who hit John don't go with guns.
Oh, sure. Yes, sir.
Well, now that we got that cleared up... as my Mexican friend said,
"To the pure life. "
Johnny?
Yes?
May I come in?
Don't... Don't you remember me?
Serepta?
Oh.
Sera, I can't tell you how happy I am you're here.
I came the minute I heard.
Have I changed so much?
No, it's... just been a long time.
It isn't true, is it?
God, how I loved you.
And I loved you.
Is it true?
Oh, no.
Aw, don't cry, Sera.
We all have our time.
I must look a sight.
For sore eyes.
You still with Pardee?
No. He treated me the way I did you.
He just up and skipped.
We should have married.
Spilt milk.
You never did, huh?
No.
Now you're alone.
I'm so glad I'm here.
So am I.
Would you still like to?
We could get a minister and just say I do.
That way, I'd have the certificate.
I'd have something to go on.
Not much.
I'd have your name.
How far would that take you?
Long ways, maybe.
How?
Johnny, you're too modest, you know?
Everybody knows who you are.
I'd be
Mrs. J.B. Books.
I'd be somebody.
That wouldn't buy you any bacon.
Well, it might.
See, that's how come
I knew that you had... that-that you was ailing bad.
This newspaper reporter here tracked me down.
He wants to put out a book on you.
He'll write it and use my name.
The Shootist...
The Life and Bloody
Times ofJ.B. Books by Serepta Books, his wife.
He said in the East that it would sell like hot cakes and he'd split it with me.
And his name is Dobkins.
Right. How did you know?
I kicked him out of here for the same reason.
Johnny, what harm is there in a marriage certificate, a piece of paper?
I don't object to that.
It's the book.
Why?
What does he know about my life?
What do you know?
He says what he doesn't know, he'll make up, and, you know, gory things, shoot-'em-ups and midnight rides and women tearing out their hair.
It will be a corker,
I promise you.
Woman, I still have some pride.
A man should be allowed his human dignity.
I spent $3.00 on the train here.
One-way.
You and Dobkins are two sides of a counterfeit coin.
I'll pay you back.
I'll pay you both ways.
What's wrong about a book?
I'll not be remembered for a pack of lies.
'Cause you're too damn mule mean, that's why.
You always was.
Why should you care what's happening? You're dying.
I have to go on living, and you don't give a hoot in hell what happens!
Why should you?
You won't be here!
God. And I loved you once.
You bastard.
May you rot to death!
# 'Twas blighted affection #
# That made him exclaim #
# Oh, willow tit-willow #
# Tit-willow #
# And if you remain callous #
# And obdurate, I #
# Shall perish as he did #
# And you will know why #
# Though I probably shall not exclaim #
# As I die #
# Oh, willow #
# Tit-willow #
# Tit-willow says I ##
You seem in fine fettle today.
I should be.
I'm full of laudanum.
I'll get your breakfast.
Good. Thank you.
I didn't mean to break up the recital.
Oh, that's all right.
It was just something for the Sunday School class for the church social.
Bond, uh, I've driven off all your other lodgers.
Is it all right if I have breakfast out here?
Of course it is.
I was delighted to see you had a lady caller yesterday.
She asked me not to announce her.
She said she wanted to surprise you.
Were you surprised?
That I was.
Oh, these clothes, uh... they're my
Sunday-go-to-meetings.
I wish you'd give them a good brushing.
Certainly.
They're getting pretty roady.
Nine days on the back of a saddle in a bedroll.
Wouldn't you rather have them cleaned?
That's the general idea.
I mean there's a new method called dry-process cleaning.
It's very good.
How long does it take?
They advertise next-day service, but tomorrow's
Sunday.
I'm afraid I'll have to settle for the brushing
'cause I'll need them first thing Monday morning.
I'll ask. If I can't get them by then,
I'll brush them.
I'll get your ham and eggs.
Just biscuits will do.
My stomach's kind of feeble today.
Oh. You sure you won't want these for church tomorrow?
I don't think so.
You're most welcome to accompany Gillom and me.
Maybe your church won't welcome me.
That's a terrible thing to say.
Doors of the church are open to everyone.
Well, my church has been the mountains and solitude.
No doors at all.
That's hardly the same thing.
We all need a minister to guide us.
Well, if you think of it, give a thought to my soul tomorrow.
I will. I have been praying for you.
I think Gillom has, too.
Thank you.
Thank you both.
Tell me, um... what did he do yesterday that made you so angry?
It isn't what he did.
It's what he didn't do.
We have that straightened out.
You should be proud of Gillom.
He has the making of something special.
I hope so.
I'm going to send
Reverend Saunders to see you tomorrow.
No, thank you.
Maybe it'll make it easier for you.
No.
Just for a few minutes.
Bond, I'm tired of people pawing over my death for this reason or that or for any reason.
A man's death is about the most private thing in his life.
It doesn't belong to Dobkins or Reverend Saunders or Thibido or you.
It's mine.
I suppose that's true of your soul, too.
My soul is what
I've already made of it.
You reprimand me for making judgments with a gun barrel poked in my face, but it's all right for you to judge me on hearsay.
But the hearsay fits.
Maybe I'm better than you've already decided.
Maybe I'm no worse than that good reverend.
Maybe you like being a gunman.
You probably prefer the word shootist.
I don't think of myself as either.
Oh, no. You're some godlike creature of infinite knowledge, aren't you?
I'm a dying man scared of the dark.
Damn you! Damn you for the pain you've brought into this house.
There we are, sir.
Mr. Books.
Yes, sir?
I'm Hezekiah Beckum, the undertaker, sir.
How do you do?
I hope you don't think my stopping by is untimely, sir.
No, I admire a man with get-up-and-go.
As the saying goes in our profession, the early worm gets the bird.
I, uh, admit to having heard some unfortunate things.
I'd like to express my heartfelt regret.
All right.
What's your proposition?
I'm prepared to offer you embalming by the most, uh, scientific methods, a bronze coffin guaranteed good for a century regardless of the climatic or geological conditions, my best hearse, uh, the minister of your choice, and the presence of at least, uh, two mourners... a headstone of the finest
Carrera marble... and a plot in size and location befitting your status, sir... and perpetual care of the grounds.
For how much?
Why, nothing, sir.
For the privilege.
No, I mean how much will you make on the deal?
Oh, Beckum, you're going to do to me what they did to John Wesley Hardin.
You're going to lay me out, let the public gawp at me for 50 cents a head,
10 cents for the children.
When the curiosity peters out, you'll stick me in a hole while you hurry to the bank with your loot.
I assure you...
Give me a scrap of paper and a pencil.
What good's your assurance when my veins are filled with your damn juice?
No. Here's what you're going to do.
First you're going to give me $50 cash.
Then early
Monday morning, you'll bring me a headstone.
I want a small headstone with this written on it.
Nothing else.
No jabbery, no angels.
You got that?
Mr. Books, you're a hard man.
I'm alive.
Ah, very well.
I'll set my stonecutter to work on the inscription immediately.
Mr. Beckum.
The $50.
Oh. Hmm.
Thank you, sir.
Early worm, early worm.
That Beckum is just what you say he is.
Well... now, how much do I owe you?
Not one bitty penny,
Mr. Books.
Why, to watch that performance you done give,
I'd have paid $ 10 in a theater.
Well, I may just accept your generosity.
Besides, I may just see if Beckum would like to buy some of J.B. Books' hair.
With your permission.
Permission granted.
Good day, sir.
What the hell?
And the third man's name is...
Mike Sweeney.
Do you know him?
Sure, I do. He's got one of those horseless carriages.
And now for the favor
I'm going to ask you.
You just tell me, sir.
Anything at all.
Don't dive in till you know how deep it is.
Today's the 27th, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Now, that's Jack Pulford,
Jay Cobb, and Mike Sweeney.
Tomorrow morning early,
I want you to go to each one of them and tell them that I'll be at the
Metropole at 11 A.M.
On Monday the 29th, and don't tell any of them that you've told the others.
Cobb's still in jail.
Yeah, well, tell him anyway.
Think you can do that for me?
Well, I know I can, but, uh, Ma's going to have conniptions if I don't go to church in the morning.
You can go to church first.
I telephoned Moses.
You can ride Old Dollar out to the Sweeney spread.
Yes, sir.
Thank you and... and good night.
Son of a bitch.
Don't cuss.
Yes, sir.
You know that kind of music gets on my nerves, especially on Sunday.
Sorry.
Ma, are you angry at Mr. Books?
Why? What did he say?
Nothing. It's just...
Ma, I'm sorry.
I got to go run some errands for Mr. Books.
I promised him.
Gillom.
Gillom.
I'll be back soon.
Soon as I can.
Oh! Oh!
What happened?
Are you all right?
I slipped in the tub.
Let me help you.
Hell.
Come on, now.
Hang on to me. That's it.
Now sit on the edge of the tub.
I'll get you another towel.
Damn!
John Bernard, you swear too much.
The hell I do.
Put your arm around my shoulder.
Why didn't you ask me to help you in the first place?
I couldn't.
Why not?
I promised you
I wouldn't be a burden.
But you are, so let's just forget about that.
I sure as hell am.
Oh, let me sit down.
Oh, sit down for a minute while I catch my breath.
Oh... well, we finally made it through a full day without having a fight.
Well, we haven't seen each other all day.
You're right there.
You know, Bond, you're such a real lady on the outside.
You're full of vim and vinegar on the inside.
I just never met anybody like you.
You're running low.
I better call Dr. Hostetler and order some more.
No. This'll do.
Oh.
That Morning Appeal.
I've skimmed newspapers all my life.
Never got the whole good out of one.
I bought this the day I arrived, and I said to myself,
"I'm going to read every word, and when I'm done,
"I'll know for a fact exactly what happened on January 22nd in the year 1901."
It was an important day in my life, and now I know.
Would you do me a favor and give this honorable incineration in my stove?
You're getting ready to do something.
What makes you say that?
This... dry cleaning... laudanum... haircut.
I want you to promise me something.
Tomorrow when you see me in all my dry-cleaning splendor and my Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes,
I want you to promise there'll be no questions... no surmises, no woman's intuition.
All curiosity stops right here and now.
Promise me?
And no tears, Bond.
Mr. Books!
In here, Gillom.
Oh, so I see.
No, you don't see.
I was helping Mr. Books out of the bathtub.
What?
You must be hungry.
No, Ma. I'm fine.
I promise.
Thank you.
Well, sir,
I got it done.
Good. How'd you get along with Old Dollar?
Oh, he's a great horse.
You should've seen the look on Marshal Thibido's face when I rode up to the jail.
He must've thought I was you coming to bust Cobb out.
Hardly me.
Which is just about what I did do
'cause Thibido's going to let Cobb out long enough to meet you.
Good.
You'll never guess how Cobb took that.
I bet he jumped with joy.
He got all white, scared to death.
Oh?
Now, Pulford was happy.
He really respects you.
He told me so.
And he sure was polite.
He said, uh,
"I eagerly await the honor... and the privilege of having him try his luck at my faro table. "
We'll have to give it a try.
Now, how about the other fella... Sweeney?
You watch out for him, Mr. Books.
That man is mean, and he hates you.
Well, we'll see if we can't clear that up tomorrow.
Sir, what's...
Thank you. We both ought to get some sleep.
Can I ask you something?
I'm tuckered out.
We'll talk tomorrow.
But I have to be out before sunup, do the milk deliveries while Cobb's in jail.
Then we'll both have a busy morning.
Before you go... there's something
I want to give you.
No, sir. No.
I won't take pay.
And I wouldn't offer it,
Gillom.
But you like Old Dollar, don't you?
Best horse I ever rode.
Well, he's yours.
I bought him back.
Here's the bill of sale.
Now let me get some sleep.
Sir?
Yeah?
When you asked me to do this,
I- I didn't realize... and... and I just hope that nothing...
Just take good care of Old Dollar.
Good night, sir.
Come in.
We got the headstone.
Mr. Beckum...
Good. Just put it there on the bed.
Beckum said as how he done the best he could, but there weren't much time.
Yeah, well, that'll be all right.
Well, I'll be goldarned, if they ain't gone and left the date off.
That'll be all right.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Early for you, ain't it?
Yeah, well,
I'm expecting somebody.
Bring me a cup of coffee, will you, Murray?
Sure.
John Bernard?
Oh.
How grand you look.
Thank you, Bond.
That dry-process cleaning is very good, isn't it?
Yeah, but it's kind of smelly.
Well, that's the naphtha.
Oh, this is my birthday.
I, uh, haven't been to a saloon for a long time, and I thought I'd get a drink and celebrate.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
You have a beautiful day for it.
It's what we call false spring.
Good-bye, Mrs. Rogers.
Good-bye, Mr. Books.
Well, boy, here's your big chance.
Fame and fortune awaits.
After I put that old man out of his misery,
I'm going to get you.
Sure, you will.
Don't wet your pants.
Marshal Thibido!
May I see you for a moment?
What's going on?
Shh! Dobkins, this is law business, not newspaper business.
Adolph S. Ochs is the publisher of the New York Times.
He's asked me for an article on how city officials are reacting to the presence of our famous shootist.
I was thinking of doing a series of stories on you.
Whooee. Let's get the hell off the street.
You tell them that's
Thibido with an "H."
Good morning.
Good morning,
Mr. Books.
You don't give a fella very long to board this thing.
Got a schedule to keep.
Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
Isn't it a beautiful day?
It sure is.
It's what we call a false spring.
Yes, sir?
Glass.
Mr. Sweeney... care to try your luck?
Hmm.
Hmm.
Whoa!
Friend... for you.
What?
Make you a little more comfortable.
Well, sir, these old bones surely thank you.
I sure hope the right fella comes along.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
This is my birthday.
Give me the best in the house.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
And I'll tell you that was for Albert!
Look out!
What's your name again?
Chrissie.
Where are we going?
Swimming.
Slow up. Slow down.
I'm not drunk! Slow down!
Wait. I'm coming.
I'm coming.
I'm definitely coming.
Whoa.
Hold on. Whoa!
I can swim.
I just can't walk or undress myself.
Come on in the water!
Take it easy.
Oh, God, help!
Please help me!
I'm coming.
It hurts!
...local fishing reported good.
Amity Boat Rental Yard's opening early
to prepare for the annual seasonal rush.
This is WISS...
How come the sun didn't use to shine in here?
We bought the house in the fall, and this is summer.
Somebody feed the dogs.
Right.
Do you see the kids?
They must be in the back yard.
In Amity you say "yard."
They're in the "yard," not too "far" from the "car."
How's that?
Like you're from New York.
Mum, I got cut.
I got hit by a vampire.
You were playing on those swings, weren't you?
Those swings are dangerous.
Stay off there.
I haven't fixed them yet.
I think you're going to live.
- It's not the prettiest thing I've ever seen.
- Hello.
- Yes.
- Can I go swimming?
Yeah, but let me clean this thing off first.
What do they usually do?
Wash up, or float up, or what?
Oh, no.
Keep them there.
I'll be out in about
15, 20 minutes. All right?
- Dry you off.
- Okay.
Go on, get a Band-Aid.
Got to go. Missing person.
Season hasn't started.
Nobody's even here yet.
Listen, Chief... be careful, will you?
In this town?
Hi, Dad.
Wait a minute.
Let me get on.
I want my cup back!
You'll get it.
Wave goodbye. Bye.
Nobody saw her go into the water?
Somebody could've.
I was sort of passed out.
You mean, she ran out on you?
No, sir.
She must've drowned.
Look, I reported it to you, didn't I?
You live here?
No. Hartford.
I go to Trinity.
My folks live in Greenwich.
Your folks were born here, right?
Yeah, I'm an Islander.
They moved off when my dad retired.
You an Islander?
No. New York City.
You here for the summer?
Come on.
Hold it.
Oh, Jesus.
Well, you're up awful early.
Is the Chief in there?
Chief, what have you got on?
If this new filing system is to work, you must keep outdated stuff off my desk.
- Just the pending, all right?
- Yes, Chief.
We got a bunch of calls about that karate school.
It seems that the 9-year-olds from the school have been karate-ing the picket fences.
Chief Brody's office.
The medical inspector.
The Fire Chief wants you to go over the Fourth of July...
Polly, I want a list of the water activities that the city fathers are planning for today.
- Right away.
- Hendricks!
Where do we keep the "Beach Closed" signs?
- We never had any.
- No?
There's a dead truck with New Hampshire plates in front of my store.
Just have him fill out the form.
Just fill it out.
Look what the kids did to my fence.
8 and 9-year-olds...
- Glasses?
- Yeah, glasses.
I'll call you later in the afternoon.
I promise.
This stuff ain't going to help me in August.
The summer ginks come down here in June.
You haven't got one thing on here I ordered.
Not a beach umbrella, not a sun lounger, no beach balls.
If I can't get service...
Chief, Polly sent me to tell you that there's a bunch of Boy Scouts out in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their merit badges.
I couldn't call them in, there's no phones out there.
Okay. Come on, get out of there.
Take this stuff back to the office and get to work on those signs.
"Beaches Closed. No Swimming.
By order of the Amity P.D."
Let Polly do the printing.
What's the matter with my printing?
Let Polly do the printing.
Chief Brody!
What have you got there?
Listen, we had a shark attack at South Beach this morning, Mayor.
Fatal. I have to batten down the beach.
Albert, come on, you kook.
Keep your arms up.
Charlie, take me out to those kids, will you?
Martin, you're going to shut down the beaches on your own authority?
What other authority do I need?
Technically, you need a civic ordinance or a resolution by a board of...
That's just going by the book.
We're really a little anxious that you're rushing into something serious here.
This is your first summer, you know.
What does that mean?
I'm only trying to say that Amity is a summer town.
We need summer dollars.
If they can't swim here they'll be glad to swim at the beaches of Cape Cod, the Hamptons,
Long Island.
That doesn't mean we serve them a smorgasbord.
But we've never had that kind of trouble in these waters.
What else could've done that to that girl?
A boat propeller?
I think possibly, yes, a boating accident.
That's not what you told me on the phone.
I was wrong.
We'll have to amend our reports.
And you'll stand by that?
I'll stand by that.
Martin, a summer girl goes swimming, swims out a little far.
She tires, fishing boat comes along...
It's happened before.
I don't think you appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
Larry, I appreciate it.
I'm just reacting to what I was told.
Martin, it's all psychological.
You yell, "Barracuda!"
And everybody says, "Huh? What?"
You yell, "Shark!"... we've got a panic on our hands on the Fourth of July.
Okay. You can take us back now.
Here's mommy, here.
I'm going to get my raft and go back out in the water.
Let me see your fingers.
Alex Kintner, they're beginning to prune.
Just let me go out a little longer.
Just 10 more minutes.
Thanks.
There are no Islanders.
None of them are from the island.
It's just a big bother.
They're bringing in...
All I want to know...
I just want to know one simple thing.
When do I get to become an Islander?
Ellen, never.
You're not born here, you're not an Islander. That's it.
Nantucket Ferries...
to Amity, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket islands.
Monday to Thursday,
8:40, 1:15, 5:45 and 6:00 p.m.
Starting July 1, 8:30 p.m...
Come back here.
- But don't bother him. Come right back.
- Okay. I won't.
Martin, I know you got a lot of problems downtown but I've got problems at the house
I wish you'd take care of.
One, I've got some cats parking in front of the house,
I can't get...
And that garbage truck next to the office, that's terrible.
What I need is a red zone.
It's a simple thing you can take care of.
- You've done it before.
- Come here a minute, please.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Listen, if the kids going in the water is worrying you they can play out here on the beach.
It's all right.
Let them go.
It's cold.
We know all about you, Chief.
You don't go in the water at all, do you?
That's some bad hat, Harry.
Chief Brody, you are uptight.
Come on. That's it.
Oh, do you know the muffin man
The muffin man
Tippet!
Did you see that?
Blood!
Everybody out!
Get them out!
Michael, get out of the water!
Alex?
We don't even know if there's a shark around here.
I can't argue with you.
I can't talk to you.
I have to talk to Mrs. Kintner.
Because this is turning into a contest.
It's not just the Gazette.
She's advertising in out-of-town papers.
I suggest we move back to council chambers where we'll have more room.
I'm responsible for public safety here.
Then go out tomorrow and see that no one gets hurt.
It's a small story.
I'll bury it as deep as I can.
The ad will run on the back along with the grocery ads.
Right in here, please.
Move on in, please.
Why do you insist on playing the heavy?
I have a point of view and I think it speaks for many of the people here.
Not only me, because I have the motel.
How do you feel about it?
Let's have some order.
Let's have order, please.
Any special questions?
Is that $3,000 bounty on the shark in cash or check?
I don't think that's funny.
I don't think that's funny at all.
All right.
That's private business between you fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.
Martin, would you please...
Chief Brody.
I just want to tell you what we're planning so far.
What about the beaches, Chief?
We're going to put on the extra summer deputies as soon as possible.
And then we're going to try and use shark spotters on the beach.
Are you going to close the beaches?
Yes, we are.
We also plan to bring in experts from the Oceanographic Institute on the mainland.
Only 24 hours.
I didn't agree to that.
Only 24 hours.
Twenty-four hours is like three weeks!
You all know me.
Know how I earn a living.
I'll catch this bird for you.
It ain't going to be easy.
Bad fish.
Not like going down to the pond and chasing bluegills or tommy cods.
This shark, swallow you whole.
Shaking, tenderizing.
Down you go.
And we got to do it quick.
Got to bring back the tourists that'll put all your businesses on a paying basis.
But it's not going to be pleasant.
I value my neck a lot more than $3,000, Chief.
I'll find him for $3,000, but I'll catch him and kill him for $10,000.
You got to make up your minds.
Gonna stay alive and ante up, gonna play it cheap and be on welfare the whole winter.
I don't want no volunteers.
I don't want no mates.
There's too many captains on this island.
$10,000 for me, by myself.
For that, you get the head, the tail, the whole damn thing.
Thank you very much, Mr. Quint.
We'll take it under advisement.
Mr. Mayor, Chief, ladies and gentlemen.
Oh, God, you scared me.
You know, Ellen, people don't even know how old sharks are.
I mean, if they live 2,000, 3,000 years...
They don't know.
Enough.
You're not going to even be able to go to sleep tonight.
Here. Come on.
Thanks.
Want to get drunk and fool around?
Oh, yeah.
Mikey really loves his present.
Where is he?
Sitting in it.
Good God.
All right, Michael, out of the boat!
Tied up to the jetties, sitting in the boat.
I'm helping Michael.
Get out of that boat!
Hi, Dad.
Just a little longer. Please?
It's his birthday.
I don't want him on the ocean!
He's not on the ocean, he is in a boat.
He won't go in the water.
I don't think he'll go in the water again, after what happened yesterday.
All right, now don't say that.
I don't want that to happen, you know that.
I want him to read the boating regulations, the rules, before he goes out on his own.
Michael, did you hear your father?
Out of the water now!
Now!
I'm tired.
Let's stop before someone reports us.
Don't worry. The Chief lives on the other side of the island.
Am I coming in straight?
Don't worry about it.
Just keep rowing.
We better catch something, this is my wife's holiday roast.
Don't worry about it.
$3,000 buys an awful lot of roast.
Come and get it.
The tide's taking it right out.
Can't we go home?
He's taking it.
Go!
Charlie, take my word for it, don't look back!
Swim, Charlie!
Come on! To me, boy!
Come on, Charlie! Swim!
Come on, Charlie, keep coming.
Keep swimming.
Come on, a little more.
Atta boy.
I can't get up.
Give me your hand, Charlie.
Help me!
Get your feet out of the water!
Can we go home now?
So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath and figure out how to tell Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
That's not funny.
That's not funny at all.
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field & Stream.
Looks more like
The National Enquirer.
All right, hold it. Hold everything.
I said, hold it!
Hello.
Hello back, young fellow.
How are you?
Say, I hope you're not going out with those nuts, are you?
The Weetock boats gotta move out first.
You have to move out or he can't get out at all.
Don't raise sail, you're going to luff it.
You got a paddle?
- I got a paddle.
- Scull it out of here.
Officer, wait a second.
How many guys are you going to put aboard that boat?
Whatever's safe, right?
Yeah, well that ain't safe.
Watch it, that's dynamite.
What are you doing with that?
Where are you going with that?
I'm going on the boat.
Please, help me get those guys out of the boat, will you?
- Sure.
- Come on.
Gentlemen, the officer asked me to tell you that you're overloading that boat!
Go on, get out of here.
You ain't going.
What do you care?
Can you tell me if there's a good restaurant or hotel on the island?
Yeah, you walk straight ahead.
They're all going to die.
Listen to me.
We've got some road block signs outside.
You've got to get somebody to help us.
Yeah, get those road block signs out on the highway.
Because we've got more people down here than we can handle.
What're you doing there?
These are your people. Go talk to them.
They aren't my people.
They're from all over.
You see all the license plates?
Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey.
I'm all by myself out there.
What happened to the extra help...
It's not until the Fourth of July.
Till then, it's you and me.
You know those guys in the fan-tail launch?
None of them are getting out of the harbor alive.
That's what I'm saying.
You know their names.
Talk to those clowns.
Everyone's having a good time today.
Tell me about it.
Polly, I'll get back to you.
Could you tell me how I could find Chief Brody?
Who are you?
Matt Hooper. I'm from the Oceanographic Institute.
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
You're the guy we called. I'm Brody.
- Oh. I'm glad to meet you.
- Me, too.
I know you got a lot on your hands.
What can we do for you?
The best thing to do is to see the remains of the first victim, the girl on the beach.
Okay, fine.
Just bear with me, will you?
Sure.
Wait till we get them silly bastards down in that rock pile.
There'll be some fun.
They'll wish their fathers hadn't met their mothers when they start digging the bottoms out and slamming into them rocks, boy.
Get away from there, you goddamn fool!
What's the matter with you?
You want to swamp us, you crazy son of a bitch?
What are these guys doing out here?
What are they doing back there?
They're chumming right now.
What the hell is that?
They're tracking the shark.
$3,000 divided four ways is what?
Watch your starboard. Jesus!
Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.
"Victim identified as Christine Watkins, female Caucasian."
And here's the way we have it.
"Probable boating accident."
The height and weight of the victim can only be estimated from the partial remains.
The torso has been severed in mid-thorax.
There are no major organs remaining.
May I have a glass of water?
The right arm has been severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss in the upper musculature.
Thank you very much.
Partially denuded bone remaining.
This was no boat accident.
Did you notify the Coast Guard about this?
No. It was only local jurisdiction.
The left arm, head, the shoulders, sternum and portions of the rib cage are intact.
Do not smoke in here.
Thank you very much.
This is what happens.
Indicates the non-frenzy feeding of a large squalus possibly longimanus or Isurus glaucus.
The enormous amount of tissue loss prevents any detailed analysis however, the attacking squalus must be considerably larger than any normal squalus found in these waters.
Didn't you get out a boat and check these waters?
No.
Well, this is not a boat accident.
And it wasn't any propeller.
It wasn't any coral reef.
And it wasn't Jack the Ripper.
It was a shark.
I wanna go AP and UPI.
I want to get on the state wire services.
See if Boston will pick it up and go national.
Call Dave Axelrod in New York and tell him he owes me a favor.
This is the shot I want with everybody and the fish in it.
Guys, could we please get organized?
I want to get a picture for the paper.
Now, can we just have the...
Ben Gardner get this?
No, we caught it.
That's swell.
It's a beauty.
Guys, please,
I need a picture for the paper.
Clear out of the way, please.
Just the guys that caught the fish.
Open it up a little bit.
I want to get a picture of the guy with the fish.
Come on.
I need a picture for the paper.
Could we get the sign, please?
Kneel down, just like in high school.
One row kneeling, one row standing.
Come on, just get out of the way.
Young fellow, could you step out of the picture?
Take your rake with you.
- We're ready.
- Thank you.
Can you get that, please.
How's that?
Larry, you won't believe it.
What kind of a shark is that?
I don't know.
I think it's a mako.
It's got a deep throat, Frank.
Yeah, but what kind?
What kind of shark?
Tiger shark.
A what?
We can start breathing again.
Is Ben getting plenty of pictures?
Oh, you bet he is.
What is this bite radius crap?
That is a big mouth.
You stuff your frigging head in there, man, and find out if it's a man-eater.
All I'm saying is that it may not be the shark.
It's just a slight...
I want you to meet Matt.
This is Larry Vaughn, our mayor.
Matt's from the Oceanographic Institute.
Nice to meet you.
Terrific, huh, Mayor?
There are all kinds of sharks in the waters.
Hammerheads, white tips, blues, makos.
And the chances that these bozos got the exact shark...
There are no other sharks like this here.
It's 100-to-1.
I'm not saying that this is not the shark.
It probably is, Martin.
It's a man-eater.
It's extremely rare for these waters.
But the fact is, the bite radius on this animal is different than the wounds on the victim.
I want to be sure.
You want to be sure.
We all want to be sure, okay?
What I want to do is very simple.
The digestive system of this animal is very slow.
Let's cut it open.
Whatever it's eaten in the last 24 hours is bound to still be in there.
And then we'll be sure.
It may be the only way to confirm it.
Look, fellows, let's be reasonable.
This is not the time or the place to perform some kind of a half-assed autopsy on a fish.
And I am not going to stand here and see that thing cut open and see that little Kintner boy spill out all over the dock.
Chief Brody?
Yes?
I just found out that a girl got killed here last week.
And you knew it.
You knew there was a shark out there.
You knew it was dangerous.
But you let people go swimming anyway.
You knew all those things, but still my boy is dead now.
And there's nothing you can do about it.
My boy is dead.
I wanted you to know that.
I'm sorry, Martin.
She's wrong.
No, she's not.
All right, fellows let's cut this ugly son of a bitch down before it stinks up the whole island.
Harve, you and Carl take it out tomorrow and dump it in the drink.
Come here.
Give us a kiss.
Why?
Because I need it.
Get out of here.
Can I help you?
The door was open.
Mind if I come in?
I'm Matt Hooper.
Oh, hi. Ellen Brody.
- Your husband's home?
- Yes.
I'd really like to talk to him.
Yes, so would I.
Come in.
Can I get you some coffee?
No. Nothing, thank you.
Oh, wine. How nice.
How was your day?
Swell.
I got red and white.
I didn't know what you'd be serving.
Oh, that's nice.
Is anyone eating this?
No.
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
Excuse me. Yes.
I've never heard it quite put that way.
But yes, I am.
I love sharks.
You love sharks?
Yeah, I love them.
When I was 12 years old, my father got me a boat and I went fishing off of Cape Cod.
I hooked a scup and as I was reeling it in
I hooked a 4.5 foot baby thresher shark who proceeded to eat my boat.
He ate my oar, hooks, and my seat cushions.
He turned an inboard into an outboard scared me to death, and I swam back to shore.
When I was on the beach,
I turned around and actually saw my boat being taken apart.
Ever since then,
I have been studying sharks and that's why I know that I'm going to go to the Institute tomorrow and tell them that you still have a shark problem here.
- Why do you have to tell them that?
- Sorry.
I'm sorry, I thought that...
You told me the shark was caught.
I heard it on the news.
I heard it on the Cape station.
They caught a shark, not the shark.
Not the shark that killed
Chrissie Watkins.
And probably not the shark that killed the little boy.
Which I wanted to prove today by cutting the shark open...
You may want to let that breathe...
Nothing.
You know, you'll be the only rational man left on this island after I leave tomorrow.
Where are you going?
I am going on the Aurora.
The Aurora? What is that?
It's a floating asylum for shark addicts.
It's pure research,
18 months at sea.
Martin hates boats.
Martin hates water.
Martin sits in his car when we go on the ferry to the mainland.
I guess it's a childhood thing.
There's a clinical name for it, isn't there?
Drowning.
Is it true that most people get attacked by sharks in three feet of water about 10 feet from the beach?
Yeah.
And that before people started to swim for recreation...
I mean, before sharks knew what they were missing that a lot of these attacks weren't reported?
That's right.
Now this shark that swims alone
- what's it called?
- Rogue.
Rogue, yeah.
This guy, he keeps swimming around in a place where the feeding is good until the food supply is gone, right?
That's called territoriality.
It's just a theory that
I happen to agree with.
Then why don't we have one more drink and go down and cut that shark open?
Martin? Can you do that?
I can do anything.
I'm the Chief of Police.
We start in the alimentary canal and open the digestive tract.
Just like I thought.
What?
Came up in the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
He didn't eat a car, did he?
No.
Tiger shark's like a garbage can.
It'll eat anything.
Somebody probably threw that in the river.
That's it.
I've got to close the beach, call the Mayor.
You got a bigger problem than that, Martin.
You still got a hell of a fish out there with a mouth about this big.
How do we confirm that by morning?
If he is a rogue, and there's any truth to territoriality at all we got a good chance of spotting him between Cape Scott and South Beach.
Where are you going?
To find him.
He's a night feeder.
On the water?
We're not gonna find him on the land.
I'm not drunk enough to go on a boat.
Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.
I'm telling you, the crime rate in New York will kill you.
There's so many problems, you never feel like you're accomplishing anything.
Violence, rip-offs, muggings.
The kids can't leave the house.
You've got to walk them to school.
But in Amity, one man can make a difference.
In 25 years, there's never been a shooting or a murder in this town.
No kidding? Want a pretzel?
Where are we?
We're right in the stretch where he's been feeding.
Can you get The Late Show on this thing?
No, it's a closed circuit TV system.
I have underwater cameras fore-and-aft.
Who pays for all this stuff?
The government? The Institute?
This stuff costs a lot of money.
I paid for this mostly myself, actually.
- You're kidding.
- No.
- You rich?
- Yeah.
How much?
Personally, or the whole family?
Doesn't make any sense.
They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?
Well, it doesn't make sense for a guy who hates the water to live on an island either.
It's only an island if you look at it from the water.
That makes a lot of sense.
What is that thing doing?
Well, it's a fish finder.
It's probably just a school of mackerel or something, all clumped together.
Wait a minute.
There's something else out there.
What is it?
About 100 yards, south-southwest.
That's Ben Gardner's boat.
You know him?
It's all banged up.
Sure I know him. He's a fisherman.
What happened?
Martin, I gotta go down and check their hull.
Wait. Why don't we just tow it all in?
We will.
I just got to check something out.
Hit the lights for me.
Let's tow it in.
Don't worry, Martin.
Nothing's going to happen.
What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Don't touch any of the equipment.
I'll be back in two minutes.
This is a great white, Larry.
A big one.
Any shark expert will tell you it's a killer, a man-eater.
The situation is that apparently a great white shark has staked a claim in the waters off Amity Island.
He'll continue to feed here as long as there's food in the water.
There's no limit to what he'll do.
We've had three incidents.
Two people killed within a week.
It'll happen again.
It happened before.
The Jersey beach, 1916.
- Five people were killed...
- In one week.
Tell him about the swimmers.
A shark is attracted to the exact kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever human beings swim.
You can't avoid it.
Opening the beaches on the Fourth of July is like ringing the dinner bell.
Look, Mr. Vaughn
I pulled a tooth the size of a shot glass out of the wrecked hull of a boat out there.
It was the tooth of a great white.
It was Gardner's boat, all chewed up.
I helped tow it in.
You should've seen it!
Where is that tooth?
Did you see it, Brody?
I didn't see it.
He dropped it on the way in.
I had an accident.
And what did you say the name of this shark is?
It's a Carcharodon carcharias.
It's a great white.
You don't have the tooth?
Look, we depend on the summer people for our very lives...
You won't have a summer unless you deal with this problem!
We have to close the beach and hire someone to kill the shark!
We have to tell the Coast Guard.
You'll have to contact the Shark Research Panel.
You'll have to ring this entire harbor!
I don't think either one of you are familiar with our problems!
I think that I am familiar with the fact that you'll ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!
Wait a second!
There are two ways to deal with this problem!
You either kill this animal or cut off its food supply.
We have to close the beaches.
Brody?
Sick vandalism.
That is a deliberate mutilation of a public service message.
I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their Buster Browns.
That's it. I won't waste my time arguing with a man who's lining up to be a hot lunch.
I'm gonna see you later, Brody.
Don't do this. He's not...
What we are dealing with here is a perfect engine, an eating machine.
It's really a miracle of evolution.
All this machine does is swim and eat and make little sharks.
And that's all.
Why don't you take a long, close look at this sign?
Those proportions are correct.
You'd love to prove that, wouldn't you?
Get your name into the
National Geographic.
Larry, if we make an effort today, we might be able to save August.
August? For Christ's sake, tomorrow's the Fourth of July!
We will be open for business.
It'll be one of the best summers we've ever had.
If you are concerned about the beaches, do whatever you have to, to make them safe.
But those beaches will be open for this weekend.
I want to know how many men you're going to send.
There is no need for me to come to Brisbane when I have a great white shark right here!
We need men to patrol the swimming area.
We've got to have help.
Anybody with a gun or a boat.
Monday!
Is Chief Federal Officer Feldman there?
He's the little guy with a crew cut.
Operator, isn't there a phone on the island?
Could you connect me, please?
Come on, get him!
Careful on the beach.
Brody to Gotcha, do you read me?
The guys from the TV station on the mainland are here.
All right.
I'll get to them later.
Brody to Scutbucket, please come in.
Brody to Daisy, do you read me?
Fascinating Rhythm, do you read me?
Come in, Hooper.
What do you see?
Nothing here, Martin.
And nothing on sonar.
Amity Island has long been known for its clean air, clear water and beautiful white-sand beaches.
But in recent days a cloud has appeared on the horizon of this beautiful resort community.
A cloud in the shape of a killer shark.
That is very shocking in the outfield.
Two balls, one strike, runners at first and third...
Fly ball, deep left field.
Jerry Christian goes back, running back near the wall
and he takes it for the out.
Oh, hi, Larry.
Why aren't you in the water?
I just put some suntan lotion on, and I'm trying to absorb some...
Nobody's going in.
Please, get in the water.
Mike, come here.
Listen, Mike.
Do me a favor, will you?
You and the other guys take the boat and put it in the pond instead?
The pond is for old ladies.
I know it's for the old ladies, but just do it for the old man.
Please?
All right.
Thanks.
I've got Sean.
Michael! Wait!
Michael, I don't like you no more.
I can stand Harry, you know...
Daisy, this is Hendricks.
Anything?
Thought I saw a shadow. Over.
Hendricks, this is Daisy here.
I don't see anything.
False alarm.
Must be this glare.
I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have in fact caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers.
As you see, it's a beautiful day.
The beaches are open, and people are having a wonderful time.
"Amity," as you know, means "friendship."
My God!
Jesus Christ!
Fin! Shark! 350!
Get in there as fast as you can!
Red one.
Martin, get them the hell out of the water.
No whistles!
Everybody, please, get out of the water.
Everybody out of the water.
Don't push!
Everybody out of the water, please.
Come on!
I want them out of there, guys.
Give an answer, please.
What's going on out there?
He made me do it.
He talked me into it.
Please, move back.
Give these people some air.
Please, move back.
Martin, it's just a hoax.
There are two kids with a cardboard fin.
Is everyone there okay?
Everyone get out of the water all right?
Folks, we had some practical joker down there with a fake fin...
Shark! A shark!
It's going into the pond!
Shark in estuary!
Now what?
Michael's in the pond.
It's going in the pond!
Somebody do something! It's in the pond!
Hurry up, get that done.
I can't do a damn thing.
Get that rope undone.
You gotta untangle that up there.
I'm doing it!
Hey, fellows, haul in your sheet.
Make it fast.
You guys okay over there?
In the pond!
Somebody get a gun and shoot it!
Doesn't anybody have a gun?
Is he dead?
No, he's not. He's in shock.
Doctor said he's okay.
Mild shock.
He can go home in the morning.
Thank you.
How's my big kid?
I'm all right.
You going to miss me tonight?
You can watch television.
Want me to bring anything from home?
My cars.
What about ice cream?
Coffee.
Want to take him home?
Back to New York?
No. Home, here.
I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry.
You got a pen, Larry?
Yeah, a pen, you know.
'Cause you're going to do what you do best.
You're going to sign this voucher so I can hire a contractor.
I don't know if I can do that without...
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the shark.
- August?
- What?
What are you talking about?
Summer's over.
You're the mayor of Shark City.
People think you want the beaches open.
I was acting in the town's best interest.
You were acting in the town's best interest.
That's why you'll do the right thing.
That's why you're going to sign this, and we'll pay that guy what he wants.
My kids were on that beach, too.
Sign it, Larry.
$10,000.
$200 a day, whether I catch him or not.
You've got it.
Get the Mayor off my back so I don't have more of this zoning crap.
You've got that.
One case of apricot brandy, and you buy the lunch.
Two cases.
And you get dinner when you get back.
Champagne, pâte de foie gras,
Iranian caviar, and don't forget the color TV.
Chief, you try this. Made it myself.
Pretty good stuff.
Thanks.
Here's to swimming with bow-legged women.
Excuse me, Chief.
Can't get a good man these days, under 60.
All gone at least 35 years.
Don't drink that.
Mr. Quint...
You're gonna need an extra hand.
- This is Matt Hooper.
- I know who he is.
I've crewed three Trans Pacs.
Transplants?
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
And an America's Cup trial.
Mr. Hooper, I'm not talking about pleasure boating or day-sailing.
I'm talking about working for a living.
I'm talking about sharking.
I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark.
I'm talking about finding a great white.
Porkers? Talking about porkers?
Just tie me a sheepshank.
I haven't had to pass basic seamanship in a long time.
You didn't say how short you wanted it.
How's that?
Give me your hands.
Dogfish?
You got a $5,000 net and you got $2,000 worth of fish in it.
Along comes Mr. Whitey, and when he's finished with that net it looks like a kiddies' scissors class has cut it up for a paper doll.
You got city hands, Mr. Hooper.
You been counting money all your life.
I don't need this.
I don't need this working-class-hero crap.
You're not going to do this aboard the ship are you, Mr. Quint?
Maybe I should go alone.
It's my party. It's my charter.
Yeah, it's your charter, it's your party.
It's my vessel.
You're on board my vessel,
I'm mate, master, pilot and I'm captain.
I'll take him for ballast, Chief.
You got him.
"Straight-jet, killing lance.
"Tail rope, eye splice, M-1, handy billy, pliers, irons..."
Sample bottles, dye marker, flares, safety float temperature gauge, spear guns, SMG...
What are you?
Some kind of half-assed astronaut?
Take that stuff down below and you lash it secure, all right?
Jesus H. Christ!
When I was a boy, every squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a swordfisherman.
What have you got here?
A portable shower or a monkey cage?
An anti-shark cage.
Anti-shark cage?
You go inside the cage?
Cage goes in the water? You go in the water?
Shark's in the water.
Our shark.
Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies
Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain
For we've received orders for to sail back to Boston
And so nevermore shall we see you again
Did you take your Dramamine?
Yes.
I put an extra pair of glasses in your black socks and there's the stuff for your nose, the zinc oxide and Blistex is in the kit.
Son of a bitch!
Goddamn women today, they can't handle nothing.
Young girls just ain't quite smart like their grandmothers were.
That's got to be Quint.
Colorful, isn't he?
He scares me.
Don't use the fireplace in the den...
What am I going to tell the kids?
Tell them I'm going fishing.
Break it up, will you, Chief?
Daylight's wasting!
Front, bow. Back, stern.
Better get it right, squirt, or I throw your ass out the little round window on the side!
Come on, Chief.
This isn't no Boy Scout picnic.
See you got your rubbers.
"Here lies the body of Mary Lee
Died at the age of 103
"For 15 years she kept her virginity
"Not a bad record for this vicinity"
All right, Commissioner, fasten your safety belt!
If you see a shark, Hooper, swallow!
Up periscope. Rig for depth charge.
Stand by fire drill.
Damage control report.
Nor'easter coming, bad news for Madison Avenue.
I'm tired of that.
How's the missus, Chief?
If they don't like you going out, they'll love you coming in.
Keep that chum line going, Chief.
We got five good miles on it.
Who's driving this boat?
Nobody. The tide.
One time, I caught a 16-footer off Montauk.
Had to stick two barrels in him.
Two to wear him down and bring him up.
Nowadays, these kids, they take out everything.
Radar, sonar, electric toothbrushes.
Jesus H. Christ.
Chief, best drop another chum marker.
Damn it, Martin!
This is compressed air.
What the hell kind of a knot was that?
You pulled the wrong one!
You screw around with these tanks, and they're going to blow up.
Yeah, that's real fine, expensive gear you've brought out here, Mr. Hooper.
I don't know what that bastard shark's going to do with it.
Might eat it, I suppose.
Seen one eat a rocking chair one time.
Next time, you just ask me which line to pull, right?
Little brown eel comes out of the cave swims into the hole comes out of the hole, goes back into the cave again.
It's not too good, is it?
Nothing's easy, is it?
One more time.
Little brown eel...
I got it!
- What?
- Get behind me.
Hooper, reverse her!
Taking a hell of a lot of line!
Chief, get the scoop out of the bucket!
Wet the reel!
Hooper, reverse her!
Duck your head down. We're swinging.
Get behind me again.
No more water.
I don't want you to drown me.
Hooper, you idiot, starboard!
Ain't you watching it!
Hooper, neutral.
Where'd he go now?
He ain't fooling me.
What's he yanking on now?
Go on, try it.
I don't know, Chief, if he's very smart or very dumb.
Jesus...
He's gone under.
He's gone under the boat.
I think he's gone under the boat.
Yeah, it's too easy.
He is a smart, big fish.
He's gone under the boat.
Keep her steady, now.
I got something very big!
I don't think so.
Chief, put your gloves on.
You put your gloves on, both of you!
Getting ready to run out again.
Quint, let it go.
Maybe you're a big yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo!
If you don't want to backstroke home, you get down here!
You don't want to listen to me, don't listen to me.
It's not a shark.
The wire's showing.
Unbuckle me.
Get the other side.
It's a tuna or swordfish wasting our time.
Take this rod.
Hooper, give the Chief a hand, will you?
Right!
Oh, shit!
It may be a marlin or a stingray but it's definitely a game fish.
Gaming fish?
Marlin, stingray bit through this piano wire?
Don't you tell me my business again.
You get back on the bridge.
Quint, that doesn't prove a damn thing.
It proves one thing, Mr. Hooper.
You wealthy college boys don't have the education enough to admit if you're wrong.
What's the point?
Hooks and lines?
You lose one, you rig one.
Twelve minutes, south-southeast, now!
Full throttle!
Aye-aye, sir!
You see, what I do, Chief, is I trick them to the surface.
And then I jab at them.
I'm not going to haul them up like a lot of catfish.
Hooper, full throttle!
I don't have to take this abuse much longer.
Your head's bleeding.
First aid there.
Start that chum line again, will you?
Let Hooper take a turn.
Hooper drives the boat, Chief.
Stop playing with yourself, Hooper.
Slow ahead, if you please.
You heard him. Slow ahead.
Slow ahead.
I can go slow ahead.
Come on down and chum some of this shit.
You're going to need a bigger boat.
Shut off that engine.
That's a 20-footer.
Twenty-five.
Three tons of him.
We're going to need a bigger boat, right?
Gotta get to work.
How do we handle this?
Come up front, Martin.
I need you.
He's circling the boat.
This is Amity Point Light Station to Orca.
Come in, Orca.
Orca. Come in.
I have Mrs. Martin Brody here.
Put her on.
Come on, Martin! Move!
I'm not going out there!
Beyond the edge of the barrels.
Go to the end of the barrels, further out.
- Further out!
- Why?
- Go further out!
- What for?
Will you go to the end of the pulpit?
What?
Will you go to the end of the pulpit?
I need something in the foreground to give it some scale!
Foreground my ass!
Your husband's okay.
He's fishing.
He just caught some stripers.
We'll bring them for dinner.
We ain't seen anything yet. Over. Out.
I'm not staying here!
I'm begging you!
God damn it!
Come here, darling.
Chief, I want you up on the bridge, just take her forward, steady.
I've never steered a boat in my life.
Just watch my hand, take her steady.
Mr. Hooper, attach the end of this line to the first keg.
I've got to get a good shot at that porker's head.
He's coming.
Hooper? Get clear of the bow.
Hurry up, will you?
Your turn, Quint.
Hooper, where are you?
Hurry it up now, tie it on.
He's coming straight for us.
Don't screw it up now.
Don't wait for me.
Come on, Hooper, hurry it up!
Tie it on!
Now.
Kill it!
Now!
Shoot!
Time.
What were you doing?
You knew I had to get a clean shot right in the head.
All right, let's see how long that barrel takes to bring him up.
Bring another barrel!
I'm coming around again!
What do we do now?
We're quitting, right?
We got one barrel on him.
We stay out here until we find him again.
We could radio in and get a bigger boat...
Don't you worry about it, Chief.
It won't be permanent.
You want to see something permanent?
You want to feel something permanent?
Just put your hand underneath my cap.
You feel that little lump?
Knocko Nolans, St. Patty's Day, Boston.
I got that beat.
It's a moray eel.
It bit right through my wet suit.
Well, Hoop, now, listen
I don't know about that, but I entered an arm-wrestling contest in a bar in San Francisco.
See this?
I can't extend that.
You know why?
'Cause in the semi-final celebrating my third wife's demise, big Chinese fellow, he pulled me right over.
Look at that.
That's a bull shark.
He scraped me when I was taking samples.
I got something for you.
There's a thresher. You see that?
A thresher's tail.
- Thresher?
- It's a shark.
You want a drink?
Drink to your leg?
I'll drink to your leg.
So we drink to our legs.
I got the crème de la crème.
Right here. Hold on.
Here, you see that?
You're wearing a sweater.
Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit.
She broke my heart.
What's that one?
What?
That one, there.
On your arm.
A tattoo. I got that removed.
Don't tell me.
"Mother."
What is it?
Mr. Hooper, that's the
U.S.S. Indianapolis.
You were on the Indianapolis?
What happened?
Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into her side, Chief.
I was coming back from the island of Tinian to Leyte just delivered the bomb, the Hiroshima bomb.
1,100 men went into the water.
Vessel went down in 12 minutes.
Didn't see the first shark for about half an hour.
Tiger, 13-footer.
You know how you know that when you're in the water, Chief?
You tell by looking from the dorsal to the tail.
Well, we didn't know.
Because our bomb mission had been so secret no distress signal had been sent.
They didn't even list us overdue for a week.
Very first light, sharks come cruising so we formed ourselves into tight groups.
You know, kind of like old squares in a battle like you see on a calendar like the Battle of Waterloo.
The idea was... the shark comes to the nearest man and he starts pounding, hollering and screaming.
Sometimes the shark would go away... but sometimes he wouldn't go away.
Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you, right into your eyes.
You know, a thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes.
Black eyes, like a doll's eyes.
When he comes at you, he doesn't seem to be living until he bites you.
Those black eyes roll over white and then...
Then you hear that terrible high-pitched screaming.
The ocean turns red.
In spite of the pounding and the hollering, they all come in.
They rip you to pieces.
You know, by the end of that first dawn... we lost 100 men.
I don't know how many sharks.
Maybe 1,000.
I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour.
On Thursday morning,
I bumped into a friend of mine...
Herbie Robinson, from Cleveland.
Baseball player, bosun's mate.
I thought he was asleep.
Reached over to wake him up.
He bobbed up and down in the water just like a kind of top.
Upended.
He'd been bitten in half, below the waist.
Noon the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura saw us.
He swung in low and he saw us.
He was a young pilot.
Younger than Mr. Hooper.
He saw us and he came in low, and three hours later... a big fat PBY comes down and starts to pick us up.
That was the time
I was most frightened.
Waiting for my turn.
I'll never put on a life jacket again.
So, 1,100 men went into the water
316 men come out.
The sharks took the rest,
June 29, 1945.
Anyway, we delivered the bomb.
What's that?
It's a whale.
Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies
Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain
Show me the way to go home
I'm tired and I want to go to bed
I had a little drink about an hour ago
And it's gone right to my head
Wherever I may roam
By land, or sea or foam
You will always hear me singing this song
Show me the way to go home
Show me the way to go home
I'm tired and I want to go to bed
I had a little drink about an hour ago
And it's gone right to my head
Wherever I may roam
On land or sea or foam
You can always hear me singing...
Start the engines.
Fire her up!
Right in the middle!
He's busting the shaft.
Put out the fire, will you?
- Pump her out.
- Done.
Everybody on deck.
He ate the light.
- Terrific.
- Excuse me.
Quint, what are you doing?
Don't waste your time.
Quint, come on.
What's wrong with this?
Hooper, take the wheel.
Brody, follow that. Watch for him.
You okay?
Chief, more left rudder!
Pull your left hand down.
I can't. It'll only go about three inches.
All of our injectors got scored from the salt water in the fuel.
Yeah, the housing's bent, you can hear it.
Try the left rudder again.
More left. Good. Once again now.
Quint, there it is.
What do you say, Chief?
The barrel is up, it's right in the stern.
I think he's right under the keg.
Grab the boat hook.
Quint, if we can get close enough...
I've got things on board that'll kill it.
Just want to goose him up.
Come on.
When he runs, you drop that rope or you'll lose your hands.
I've seen fingers torn out at the knuckles.
Whole sea's bones, full of them.
Give it to me a minute.
Haul in that line or it'll foul us.
Start the engine.
Where are you going?
I'm going to make a phone call.
Hello, mayday, Orca.
Coast Guard?
Coast Guard, this is the Orca.
Do you read me?
Coast Guard, this is the Orca.
Do you...
Excuse me, Chief.
That's great!
That's just great!
Now, where the hell are we, eh?
You're certifiable, Quint, you know that?
You're certifiable!
You're certifiable, but I'll tell you this!
Boys,
I think he's come back for his noon feeding.
Hook me up another barrel.
Bring her around after him.
Full throttle!
Get me right up alongside of him!
I can't rev it up that high, it's not going to take it!
Five degrees port.
All right, hold your course.
Five degrees port now.
Hold your course.
Fast fish.
Watch my hand.
Be sure you watch my hand!
Follow me.
Lad, you watch him now! Starboard!
Run him down, Hooper.
Hard aport.
Watch him. Starboard.
I can't believe it.
Two barrels and he's going down again.
It's incredible.
- They're up again!
- Now what?
Why don't we lead the shark into shore instead of him leading us out to sea?
Grab a couple of poles.
Hang on now, we're going around.
Into starboard. Easy.
I'm going to back her off now.
Watch those barrels, boys.
Watch them.
All right, gentlemen, snag them.
Now then, tie them to the stern cleats.
Brody, bring your end around the cleat.
That's right, it'll lock itself off.
Give him room, Brody.
Stay clear of the line!
Watch it. Stand clear.
Stand away from those stern cleats!
Back home we got a taxidermy man.
He's going to have a heart attack when he sees what I brought him.
Throttle back.
You're losing a cleat.
My God, this one, too.
They're both going.
He's eating his way through that line.
He's working his way right up to us.
Quint!
Come on, Quint. Hurry!
Out of my way.
Watch it.
Untie this.
He'll pull out the transom.
Make it fast!
We got another line in him!
I can't, it's trying to run!
We better get another line!
Pull, you son of a bitch!
I hope your back breaks!
Go ahead.
Pull your bloody heart out.
Tie him off!
It's impossible!
Boys, it's too tight!
He's pulling us!
We're breaking up over here!
We're breaking up! Cut it!
Watch your hands!
Cut it quick.
I can't hold it!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him.
Not with three barrels, he can't.
What about us?
Hooper, get the pump out of the locker in front of you, will you?
We're going to sink, aren't we?
Keep an eye on the barrels.
Pump it out, Chief.
Starting to go under.
He can't with three barrels on him.
Not with three he can't.
You ever have one do this before?
No.
He's chasing us.
I don't believe it.
I'm going to draw him into the shallows.
Draw him into the shallow water.
I'm going to draw him in and drown him.
We're heading in, Brody.
Thank Christ!
You ever had a great white do that?
No.
How far do we have to go?
Don't put that much pressure on it.
God damn it.
Shut up. Get back there.
Hold on.
Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies
Farewell and adieu, you ladies of Spain
For we received order for to sail back to Boston
You idiot, you burned out the bearings.
All right, stop the boat. Stop it.
What exactly can you do with these things of yours?
I think I can pump 20 cc of strychnine nitrate into him.
If I can get close enough.
Get this little needle through his skin?
No, I can't do that.
If I can get him close to the cage,
I can get him in the mouth.
That shark will rip that cage to pieces.
You got any better suggestions?
Easy.
Up she goes.
Ease her up.
Ain't got no spit.
Try and keep him off me until I'm lower.
Okay, I'm ready.
Bring him up, God damn it.
Bring him up now!
Pull it up. Pull it.
Pull him up.
Come on, Quint, bring him in.
It's giving way!
Rig something!
Got it?
It's coming.
Slow it down.
Slower.
All right, come on.
Show me the tank.
Blow up!
Smile, you son of a bitch!
Quint?
No.
Can we get in on those?
What day is this?
It's Wednesday.
It's Tuesday, I think.
I think the tide's with us.
Keep kicking.
I used to hate the water.
I can't imagine why.
That's a nice piece, save it for the market.
Slaves.
Yes, females.
Each one a man's delight.
Young and not so young.
Strong and not so strong.
Some have talented heads.
Some have talented hands.
And some have hidden talents.
Hey Lucan, let's see those hidden talents.
No no, for your own sake I must protect you.
You would be struck blind, turned to stone.
Time for bids on the Nubian.
Five gold pieces.
- Six!
- 40 pieces of Egyptian gold for the lot of four.
For the lot?
Surely you don't...
Take it or leave it, you know women are worthless nowadays.
It's better to sell them and get on with the men.
They're yours.
Handle them gently.
I won't handle them at all.
Cornelia, Cornelia.
Take care of these creatures.
Priscium, we've enough kitchen help.
Alright girls.
What are your names?
Deidre of the Urs.
I'm Livia, daughter of Shipio.
Nobody cares who your father was.
If he were worth knowing you wouldn't be here.
And you.
What's your name?
Answer me!
Do you understand me?
What's your name?
What's your name?
Stop!
I am Bodicia from the Brittany.
And you?
Do you understand me?
I am Mamawi.
Good.
I see you do.
Now get out of those filthy rags!
You, draw water.
Strip.
- No.
- I will not.
Hey Cornelia, can't you control your silly geese?
Would you like to pluck them for me?
Wulfstan.
There you are.
Can we expect them for dinner tonight?
Don't be silly, we haven't even cleaned them yet.
Douse them.
Your duties will chiefly be serving the patrons in the arena.
And our patrons expect good service.
It was a miserable afternoon.
Your gladiators seemed bored to die.
I know, I know, but what can I do?
Find another Spartacus?
The gods forbid.
I lost a small fortune during that revolt.
I need something new, something really exciting.
What are you staring at?
Oh yes, you'll get used to it.
It only happens once a week.
One of us had to die.
It's the rule.
- Whose rule?
- The rule of the arena.
We're gladiators.
Slaves!
That's what you are.
No one likes to fight to the death but they scream for blood on the sand and they pay.
Here we are.
Caesar's actions are emptying Rome.
All the best people are coming here to Brundisium.
These are your best people?
Timarchus puts on a better show for dinner than he does in the arena.
Don't keep telling me things
I've already told myself a hundred times.
- Two of the new girls.
- Nice, nice!
The fair one is a priestess.
It's said Timarchus that the black is a fine dancer.
I thought you'd like that.
Have her dance.
- May I help you?
- Uh huh.
Bird of paradise.
Here.
I'll teach the bitch.
No no here, I'll show you.
Watch me.
No no.
Good man, Quintus.
What do you think Priscium, would he do?
Well, he's a little small.
But a little goes a long way.
Good, good, good.
Septimus, call them to attention.
For the game this week,
I've planned a special.
Two men against one.
The only one I know who's a match for two is Septimus.
And to face him we have selected Quintus, and the victor of our last game, Marcus.
Well Lucinia, that means a warm bed tonight.
Our master knows what a gladiator needs.
Those who are to fight have their pick of companions for the night.
Then they fight better.
Bodicia, which one do you want warming your bed tonight?
That's enough, Mamawi.
Oh it's only Priscium.
But I bring news that should interest you.
The gladiators apparently are fond of fresh blood.
You are expected.
Oh gods.
Do you mean we have to satisfy their animal heat?
Well not you, young lady.
You three, Deidre, Bodicia, and Mamawi, come with me.
- What do you want with us?
- I?
I want nothing at all with you.
Quintus, Ursus, and Marcus desire your company.
Well I don't desire theirs.
Do you, Mamawi?
- Do you, Deidre?
- Oh no, I guess not.
Oh by the gods Bodicia.
You know your desires count for nothing.
Besides, it's not the first time you...
- Forget it.
- She's a Roman noble lady.
Are you coming or should I call Cornelia?
It's dark early tonight.
Go away.
I don't need you.
Well I'm here.
- If I can do anything.
- No.
I'm sure Septimus will take care of everything tomorrow.
You might well win.
Get out of here, leave me alone!
- I will pray for you.
- Pray?
Are there gods who will listen to the cattle
- in the butcher's stables?
- Don't say that!
Most of the young men I grew up with have died at the hands of the Romans.
At least if you die, you'll die with a sword in your hand.
I'd still just be killing another slave.
The only way I can defy them is to deprive the bloodthirsty vultures of their pleasure.
- Not fight at all.
- There must be another way.
To escape?
Where?
How?
What are you thinking of?
Is the wind in the trees bringing the word from your gods?
What are they telling you, priestess?
Quintus!
The Romans have taught you to live like an animal!
Have they also taught you to forget your past?
Come on Septimus!
What about serpents?
Wouldn't huge serpents excite them?
- Huh?
- Snakes are snakes.
Once in Libya I saw half a dozen men stomped by stampeding elephants.
What about elephants?
Hurry.
Hurry!
The men will be done with their baths.
They can't bear waiting.
Men, I haven't seen any men.
She means those pot-gutted old clowns we served last night.
Those are Roman citizens.
They own the world.
And they'll teach you respect soon enough.
Romans are pigs.
How did you new ones like the arena?
Oh it was very exciting.
The crowd, the fight, the killing!
Bloodthirsty vultures.
The gladiators wouldn't like that.
I meant the spectators.
Of course it wasn't an equal fight.
After all, the first one
Septimus killed was only a black.
Livia!
Let her be, she's one of us!
The women, the women are ruining us!
Not you Priscium.
Surely the women haven't...
They're trying to kill each other!
I'm going to make an example out of everyone!
- Well?
- They could kill me!
- Where's Septimus?
- You gave him a holiday for his victory.
Septimus, you've come back.
I come for Lucinia.
For all I know Lucinia's dead.
What?
- Yeah.
- Where is she?
I kill!
Lucinia, Lucinia!
Where is she, where?
I'll smash all you worthless women to pieces!
I was afraid.
Don't be silly, you're never afraid.
Oh ruined, everything is ruined!
Apollonius!
Apollonius, come here boy.
If they could put on such a show in the arena...
What are you blathering about?
Apollonius, Apollonius!
It would be something new.
Return of the Amazon.
- Master?
- Go away boy, can't you see we're talking?
These barbarian women.
Mad for blood, pitted against each other in the ultimate test of the arena.
Could it succeed?
Could it?
Why not?
Think of it!
I did.
Nice work, keep at it.
Septimus!
- Yes Master.
- Why aren't you supervising the women?
You know I want to feature a couple of them at next week's game.
Do as I ordered you.
Yes Master.
Don't pose with the sword, slash with it.
Mamawi.
Mamawi, what sort of conduct is this?
Roman.
Hail, we who are about to die salute you.
Hail yourselves.
Good fighting and good rest for the losers.
Hail.
We've seen that before!
We've seen these fights for years!
We want the women!
Yeah, give us the women!
Give us the women!
You've come to see the women fight.
Prepare yourselves, here they are.
Name yourselves.
I am Bodicia of the Brittany.
Deidre of the Urs.
Are you prepared for combat?
We stand ready before you for combat.
We're ready for combat.
Whoever heard of taking money after a fight?
How much?
Come on, Brittany.
Fight!
Your success in the arena has won us all a reward, Bodicia.
- How do I look?
- Like a Roman.
Good, then I shall certainly overcome my provincial opponents.
She thinks she's different, but she's a slave too.
She smiles when Timarchus says smile and she'll die when Timarchus says die.
You know it's true, don't you Mamawi?
I can't talk with this thing on.
It makes my head ring like a bell.
What's wrong?
I was just suggesting to Mamawi that one of us may die in the next fight.
Yes.
- Yes but who can help us?
- We'll have to help
- each other.
- We have to help ourselves.
Hail Bodicia, conqueror from Brittany.
No I think Deidre fell a victim to Bacchus, not to me.
Septimus, call them to attention.
Men, gladiators.
Tomorrow there will be another game.
Another one?
Septimus, this is the list of male gladiators, and Cornelia, these will be our special attractions.
Mamawi.
And Livia.
Septimus, Septimus!
- Septimus!
- Oh, what's wrong woman?
- I don't wanna fight!
- Tomorrow?
Tomorrow Mamawi and Livia are fighting, not you.
I'm scared.
I had a dream.
Sort of nightmare.
I had to fight.
I tried to call you but
I didn't have my voice.
Septimus, please, talk to Timarchus.
- Tell him this will end badly.
- You're mad, woman.
He'd have me whipped if I gave him advice.
This is wrong, why should women have to fight?
What kind of men put women into the arena?
Stop it
Lucinia, it could be worse.
Believe me.
But some of the women could be killed.
That's for the gods to decide.
The gods?
- What's got them up today?
- Who knows.
You credit them with brains?
Name yourselves.
I am Mamawi of Nubia.
I am Livia.
Child of Shipio.
- And a daughter of Rome.
- Is this true Timarchus?
- Is she a citizen?
- Would you murder
- our children before us?
- Shipio is an honored name!
Friends!
Friends!
She was sold into slavery!
Has she committed a capital crime?
- If not why bring her here?
- Wait!
Get another!
Get another one, quickly!
- Which one, Timarchus?
- Any one of them!
All of them are working.
Except Lucinia.
No!
If I live to be 100 I'll never forget her face.
She died for you, Livia!
Is it my fault the crowd preferred a Hiberrian to a Roman?
I didn't murder her.
Murder?
She was armed!
She tried to kill me!
She wasn't armed when you killed her.
The archers were!
I didn't want to kill her.
I was afraid.
They were going to kill me!
Ah!
We all fear, that's what they want!
Oh sit down, Mamawi.
You'll get used to it, believe me.
Things can go very well for you if you please the master.
- By killing?
- Only a weakling or a woman is sorry about killing.
Ooh!
I feel pity for you.
Killing to please your master.
You're a slave by your own choice!
Shut up!
Or I'll have you whipped.
Watch what you say, all of you.
Or you'll all be whipped.
Priscium wants to speak to you.
Timarchus is pleased, his patrons are begging for another show.
He plans another special for tomorrow.
But that's three this week!
You should thank the gods that people come to see you.
Who will fight?
Mamawi and Bodicia.
The victors of our first two fights.
Priscium, wait.
I believe it's the custom for a gladiator to choose a companion the night before a fight.
Yes, that's so.
You claim that right?
Who is the lucky man?
- Or woman?
- I choose Septimus.
Septimus, eh?
I didn't think he made much of an impression on you.
Priscium, I claim that right.
Oh alright, alright.
Oh women, women, you can never please them.
Don't forget to ask him about the reward for loyalty.
Lucinia was a faithful servant and now she's dead.
Timarchus is a good master.
Timarchus is a swine!
Death to Timarchus!
You drunken slut!
You steal the master's wine, you bitch!
I'll teach you!
I'm sorry Septimus.
We're all sorry about Lucinia.
I know you loved her.
She gave you a child.
That men should fight and die seems natural.
The world outside isn't much different from the arena.
But that women, that Lucinia...
I'm only trying to show you that you should help us.
Do you want your child to grow up in this place?
And perhaps one day die in the arena?
Lucinia would want you to think of the child.
To keep her safe, to escape from this place.
You know the way through the catacombs.
We could escape to the sea.
We'll meet you at the wine cellar after the lights are out.
Can you bring some weapons?
Do it for Lucinia.
One sound and you're a dead Roman.
She's less dangerous if she's with us.
Shh!
He's not here!
You sure he understood where to meet us?
He understood.
Maybe he had some difficulty getting the weapons.
Well, if he doesn't come soon we can try it on our own.
No!
One wrong turn in this maze and we'd be lost forever.
We'll wait.
For a while.
I think that will be sufficient.
Assassin!
You have no loyalty!
I would have given you another woman!
There are no more women.
All women are dead to me!
You hear that, Rufinius?
He's mad!
You know the penalty, take him away!
- He has served you well.
- Crucify him!
Crucify him!
Crucify him.
Don't be a fool.
Timarchus is not going to free anyone.
Only the loser will be free.
You're right.
We're all going to die one by one, just like the men.
Unless we fight.
Like last night?
I'm going to be free my way.
We who are about to die salute you.
See to the preparations,
I will guard the man.
A man should die as he lived.
So be it.
Mamawi, listen.
You must listen to me.
What do you suggest then, that we try to kill each other?
Mamawi.
If it did come down to that, could you really kill me?
It may be you who has to decide whether or not
- you can kill me.
- Alright.
We'll do it your way.
Freedom!
Give the order!
Archers, shoot!
We fought for our freedom, Master.
Now you fight for yours.
You heard her, Master!
Skewer them!
No!
Stick him!
You know what happens to a rebellious slave?
You'll die!
You'll crucify!
Don't, listen to me!
No, no please, please!
I am one of you!
I am a Roman like all of you!
Have mercy on an old man.
No!
Help, soldiers!
No, please, please!
Here, take this, I want you to have it, take it all!
Come on!
Don't touch me you filthy creatures or I'll scream.
The women are rebelling!
The women, hurry!
We can get there fast.
Seal off all the exits.
The catacombs, it's our only chance!
Sluts, they butchered everybody.
Do any of you know how big the catacombs are?
During the Spartacus servile war a group of slaves hid down there for a couple of months.
Bring the hounds.
There are bodies in there!
The dead won't harm us, let's go!
No wait.
- Are you coming?
- Assemble the men.
You have until sunset, then I sound the horn
- for my men to return.
- You can't do that!
It's your duty to crucify the rebels!
My forces are expected in Rome.
They're in here!
We'll have to jump.
- Come on Deidre.
- Nn nnn.
Jump!
Deidre, hurry!
Try, come on!
You've got to do it!
No, don't!
Look out!
Think you can handle them?
Come on, come on, hurry!
Hurry!
l am, beyond a doubt,
the last of the old-timers,
My name is Jack Crabb, and I am the soIe white survivor of the BattIe of LittIe Bighorn, popuIarIy known as Custer's Last Stand.
WeII, Mr Crabb,
I'm more interested in the primitive
IifestyIe of the PIains Indian than I am in...
(LAUGHS ) ...taII taIes about Custer.
TaII taIes?
Are you caIIing me a Iiar?
No, no. It's just that...
I'm interested in the way of Iife of the Indian, rather than, shaII we say, adventure.
You think the BattIe of LittIe Bighorn was an adventure?
LittIe Bighorn was not representative of encounters between whites and Indians, Mr Crabb.
You see, the near genocide of the Indian...
- The near what?
- Near genocide.
It means...
...extermination.
The kiIIing off of an entire peopIe.
That's practicaIIy what we did to the Indian.
But, of course, I wouIdn't expect an oId Indian fighter, Iike you, to agree with me.
- Turn that thing on.
- Pardon?
I said, turn that thing on and shut up.
You sit there and you'II Iearn something.
I knowed GeneraI
George Armstrong Custer for what he was, and I aIso knowed the Indians for what they was.
1 1 1 years ago, when I was ten years oId, my famiIy, in crossing the Great PIains,
was wiped out
by a band of wild lndians,
Everybody was killed or drug off
by them murdering varmints
except me and my sister Caroline,
(MUSlC: DOLEFUL HARMONlCA)
Ah! Oh!
Bye, Jack. I'II see you in heaven.
Goodbye, CaroIine.
We didn't know the difference then,
but it was a band of Pawnee
what attacked us,
l ain't had no use
for Pawnee ever since,
But this one wasn't a Pawnee,
He was a Cheyenne brave,
l later got to know him well,
His name was
Shadow That Comes ln Sight,
At first sight of an lndian camp,
what you think is:
''l see their dump, Where's the camp?''
He brought us to their chief,
His name was Old Lodge Skins,
who later become my granddaddy,
What do they want, CaroIine?
It's as pIain as day what they want, Jack.
What?
Me.
To show good manners,
Old Lodge Skins smoked
with our oldest male survivor,
They didn't know I was a woman.
That expIains why they didn't rape me right off.
I don't think they're going to bother you.
No such Iuck, Jack.
They'II get me tonight, for sure.
Poor Caroline never did have
no luck with men,
l reckon she figured
we both couldn't get away
and she'd send help to rescue me,
The next morning, l found myself
in that lndian camp all alone,
But the Cheyenne, who call
themselves the Human Beings,
had no idea to hurt me,
l was an honoured guest
and they gave me a treat, Boiled dog,
Dog ain't bad, neither,
Greasy, l'll admit,
but you'd be surprised
how delicate the flavour is,
especially when you're starving,
You see, the Human Beings
adopted me as one of their own,
Shadow That Comes ln Sight
taught me the bow and arrow
and how to stalk game,
Burns Red ln The Sun showed me how
to protect my pale skin from sunburn,
lt's little known that some lndians,
like Burns Red,
will sunburn their own selves,
But my real teacher was my adopted
grandpa, Old Lodge Skins,
He taught me to read a trail, Cheyenne
language and lots of other things,
For a boy, it was a kind of paradise,
l wasn't just playing lndian,
l was living lndian,
Only one thing bothered me:
l was small for my years,
ln fact, darn near a runt,
The Pawnee stoIe seven ponies.
There's going to be a war party.
But you can't go. You're too IittIe and weak, Iike a girI.
Run away now or I'II kick you.
The lndians had never heard
of fist fighting, and it amazed them,
How did you do that?
I'm sorry, Younger Bear.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
The lndian way: never feel sorry
about beating an enemy
unless, having conquered his body,
you want his spirit as well,
l had made the first real enemy
of my life,
There once was a Human Being, and he was very smaII.
But he won a name: LittIe Man.
You've heard of him?
No, Grandfather.
He went on a war party against the Pawnees.
But the Pawnees were many.
One by one, the Human Beings were rubbed out.
LittIe Man was very brave.
The Pawnees caIIed out to him,
''If you wiII quit fighting, we wiII Iet you go.''
But LittIe Man answered,
''It's a good day to die.''
FinaIIy, they cut off his head, but he kept fighting without his head.
He rode among the Pawnees
Iike a whirIwind, and his head, which was stuck on a spear, started to shout the war cry.
The Pawnees couId take no more, and they ran away.
When they Iooked back, they saw the body of LittIe Man
Iie down among his friends.
LittIe Man was smaII, but his bravery was big.
The Human Beings don't require
a boy to be a warrior
if he ain't got the temperament,
and Little Horse didn't,
lf he wanted to stay
with the women,
that was all right
with the Human Beings,
We wiII Ieave the ponies here.
You hoId them.
No! I don't want to.
I want to go to the Pawnee camp.
You... You aren't even a Human Being.
You're white.
He didn't believe it himself,
Younger Bear was just trying
to hand me the worst possible insult,
Ah! Ah!
LittIe White Man...
...fooI poor Pawnee.
Big fooIing. You want to eat?
Pawnees was always
sucking up to whites,
LittIe White Man not mad, huh?
See? Pawnee friend.
Fix this bad Indian for LittIe White Man.
Uh!
l always felt kind of bad
about that poor Pawnee,
l didn't mean to kill him,
l just meant to distract him,
l had made a real enemy
of Younger Bear,
I give you these ponies, but...I owe you a Iife.
Saving his life was the final insult,
This boy is no Ionger a boy.
He is a brave. He is IittIe in body, but his heart is big.
His name shaII be LittIe Big Man.
I don't understand it. Why wouId they kiII women and chiIdren?
Because they are strange.
They do not seem to know where the centre of the earth is.
We must have a war on these cowards and teach them a Iesson.
(BEATING ON DRUMS
AND CHANTING )
This wiII be the first time, my son,
I face the whites as an enemy.
I don't know whether you remember before you became a Human Being and as dear a son to me as those I made with
BuffaIo WaIIow Woman and the others, but I won't speak of that unfortunate time.
I just want to say, if you beIieve riding against these white creatures is bad, you can stay out of the fight.
No one wiII think the worse.
Grandfather, I think it's a good day to die.
My heart soars Iike a hawk.
l'm sorry to say that Old Lodge Skins'
war against the whites
was kind of pitiful,
Not that the Human Being
wasn't brave,
No warrior ever walked the earth
more brave than a Human Being,
But Old Lodge Skins' idea of war
was different from the whites',
Half our party didn't use weapons,
They ''took coup'',
hit the enemy with a little stick,
Humiliate them,
That was how a Human Being
taught a coward a lesson
and won a war,
Shadow!
Repeating rifles
against bow and arrow,
l never understood how the whites
could be so proud of winning
with them kind of odds,
Yee...argh... !
God bIess George Washington!
Before l knowed it,
them words popped out,
God bIess my mother!
You murdering fooI!
Do I have to cut your throat before you see I'm white?
- White?
- Sure I'm white.
Didn't I say, ''God bIess Washington and my mother''?
What kind of Indian wouId say a fooI thing Iike that?
Lend me that to get off this paint.
The troopers took me
and turned me over
to the Reverend Silas Pendrake,
for moral guidance
and a Christian upbringing,
- Can you drive a buggy, boy?
- Oh, yes, sir. I can do it.
You're a Iiar, boy.
If you was reared by the Indians, how couId you Iearn to drive a buggy?
We shaII have to beat the Iying out of you.
(MUSlC: DOLEFUL HARMONlCA)
Dear Jack.
WeIcome to your new home.
Your travaiI is over, enfoIded now as you are in Christian Iove.
WeII, boy, are you unabIe to converse?
- No, I'm gIad to meet your daughter.
- You are addressing my wife.
Poor boy. Poor darIing.
Think of the years of suffering, deprivation and hardship among those awfuI savages.
The boy's deprivation, my dear, has been more spirituaI than physicaI.
The Indians know nothing of God and moraI right.
They eat human fIesh, fornicate, aduIterise, misogynise and commune constantIy with minions of the deviI.
It must be our task... nay, our Christian duty,
- to beat the misery out.
- Beat the poor boy?
- Not whiIe there's breath in my body.
- l could have kissed her,
I didn't mean beat him IiteraIIy.
I meant beat him symboIicaIIy.
Poor boy. He hasn't even had a proper bath.
- I detect the odour of food.
- I shaII wash this poor boy.
It's supper time.
It is my Christian duty to give this boy an immediate, thorough bath.
- Take your cIothes off.
- Off?
- Yes.
- AII of them?
Every stitch. But I shaII avert my eyes at the necessary moment.
# Bringing in the sheaves
# Bringing in the sheaves
# We shaII come rejoicing
# Bringing in the sheaves #
Greatest bath l ever had in my life,
# ShaII we gather at the river?
# The beautifuI, the beautifuI river #
You do reaIise, don't you, dear Jack, that the Reverend Pendrake is not aItogether wrong?
What? I mean, what, ma'am?
WeII, Jesus is your saviour.
- You do reaIise that, don't you?
- Oh, Lordy. Yes, Mrs Pendrake.
Are you thinking of Jesus, Jack?
Yes'm. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
- You mustn't fib to me.
- Oh, no.
I Iove Jesus and Moses and aII of them.
There's quite a difference.
Moses was a Hebrew, but Jesus was a GentiIe,
Iike you and me.
Ain't you done washing that boy yet?
I'm giving the chiId reIigious instruction.
I want to eat.
Looks Iike a weII-growed chiId, if you ask me.
AII right now, dear. PIease stand up and Iet me dry you off.
I shaII avert my eyes, of course.
Now step out of the tub.
ActuaIIy, you are rather weII-grown, Jack.
You're smaII, but...nice-Iooking.
Did you know that?
- No, ma'am.
- WeII, you are.
AII the more reason for you to receive reIigious instruction.
The girIs, I'm sure, wiII aII be after you.
- And, Jack...
- Ma'am?
That way Iies madness.
What way, ma'am?
You'II understand these things better when you're oIder.
The point is, my dear boy, that we aII must resist temptation.
Purity is its own reward.
Dear Jack...
WeIcome to your new home.
(BREATHLESS ) Now dress...
...and come in to supper.
l went to school and learned all over
how to read and write and cipher,
lt was strange at first,
but Mrs Pendrake tutored me
and l learned fast,
But there was one thing
l didn't know about
and that was a thing called sin,
I caught you at the gates of heII!
Boy, the hand of God must smite the carcass of man.
It's worth it, dear Jack.
It's worth it a miIIion times over to be pure and good, to waIk in the paths of righteousness.
There's no happiness Iike it.
Do you beIieve me, Jack?
Do you beIieve me?
Yes, ma'am. I sure do.
# Amazing grace... #
So it was
l entered my religion period,
l was a great little hymn singer,
and l wasn't fooling,
l'd been saved,
I baptise you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the HoIy Spirit.
O Lord, Iook down upon this poor boy who Iived among the heathen and cIeanse him of the corruption of their fouI, pagan ways and make him white again as the snow.
Let him be reborn and repurified in thy name.
I baptise you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the HoIy Spirit.
Amen.
Mrs Pendrake was right
about temptation,
l'd have nothing to do
with them Jezebels,
l told her about my triumph
over temptation,
and we read the Bible
for about an hour to celebrate,
As the weeks went by, l fell more
and more in love with Mrs Pendrake,,,
,,,spiritually, of course,
I shaII be off for my shopping.
The boy's doing so poor these days, why not take him aIong and air him?
- He'd be bored with the shopping.
- No, I wouIdn't, ma'am.
AII right, then.
You come with me, Jack.
Good morning, Mr Kane.
This is Jack, my adopted son.
What's your pIeasure, ma'am?
WeII, Iet's see.
I think I shaII have a sassafras fIip.
How about you, buster?
Oh. Yeah, I'II have the same.
Never mind for me.
I must do my shopping.
It wouId bore you terribIy, Jack.
You stay here and have some cake.
- I'II take care of him, Mrs Pendrake.
- Thank you very much, Mr Kane.
That soda shop was something,
Especially that elephant-head spigot,
l was playing with it
and enjoying myself,
Then, all of a sudden,
an awful feeling run through me,
Where had that fellow gone to?
(MRS PENDRAKE) Don't.
Don't. No, don't.
Oh, yeah. No, don't...
Yeah, pIease. No, don't.
(GIGGLING ) Pagan beast.
HeIp!
You deviI. You fiIthy, dirty deviI.
Heathen.
No, no...yeah, yeah, yeah.
No. HeIp! HeIp! HeIp. I'm dying.
(JACK) She was calling him a devil
and moaning for help,
but l didn't get no idea
she wanted to be rescued,
That was the end
of my religion period,
l ain't sung a hymn in 1 04 years,
After starving a while,
l took up with a swindler,
name of Allardyce T Meriweather,
After Mrs Pendrake, his honesty
was downright refreshing,
(MERIWEATHER) It is my mission to pass on to you...
Meriweather was one
of the smartest men l ever knowed,
but he tended to lose
parts of himself,
When l joined him, his left hand
and his left ear were already gone,
We might see a miracIe, one I have witnessed before.
The power of this eIixir has been proven...
(CRIES OUT) WaIk!
WaIk!
During my years with Meriweather,
he lost an eye
as a result of a fifth ace
dropping out his sleeve
in a poker game,
lt didn't faze him, though,
Deception was his life's blood,
even if it caused him to get
whittled down kind of gradual like,
You're improving. You just can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty.
The one that ruined you was that Indian, OId Tepee.
- You mean OId Lodge Skins?
- He gave you a vision of moraI order in the universe, and there isn't any.
Those stars twinkIe in a void, dear boy, and the two-Iegged creature schemes and dreams beneath them, aII in vain.
AII in vain, Jack.
- You hear anything?
- Listen to me!
Men wiII beIieve anything, the more preposterous the better.
WhaIes speak French at the bottom of the sea.
The horses of Arabia have siIver wings.
Pygmies mate with eIephants in darkest Africa.
I have soId aII those propositions.
WeII, maybe we're aII fooIs and none of it matters.
Ah...
You stay with AIIardyce Meriweather, and you'II wear siIk.
I don't know as I want to wear siIk.
My dear boy, what eIse can a man of parts wear than siIk?
Tar and feathers, I reckon.
AII right. Sit right there.
Don't make no moves unIess you want a IittIe dayIight in your Iiver.
What, may I ask, brings you out into the wiIds at this hour, sir?
- That them?
- Yes.
I've seen this young one before.
- I've never been in this country.
- You Iook famiIiar, bub.
Oh! Sir...
What's in there? Lye?
You can't expect me to reveaI its constituents.
Sir, pIease.
You're wasting precious medicine.
Seven foIks are haIf-dead because of this. What's in it?
Nothing harmfuI, I assure you.
- What?
- MostIy water.
Whiskey, a IittIe pepper, oiI of cIoves, ginger root...
- What's that?
- What's what?
Oh, that. It's a dozen snake heads, to give it strength.
AII right, boys.
Yee-ha... !
Got caught, Jack, that's aII.
Life contains a particIe of risk.
- You don't know when you're Iicked.
- Licked?
I'm not Iicked.
I'm tarred and feathered, that's aII.
AII right, boys.
I reckon they've been rode enough.
- Why, Hickok himseIf can't hit three.
- Throw up three.
What's your name, son?
- Jack Crabb.
- Lord above!
I've tarred and feathered my own brother!
It's wonderfuI, Jack.
I can give you something you never had before, and something I never had before, neither...
...a reaI...famiIy Iife.
Yeah.
You are back in the bosom of your famiIy, Jack.
OK, now you.
I don't know anything about guns.
I never even carried none.
Lord! What kind of upbringing did them Indians give you?
Never carried no gun? Why, a man ain't compIete without a gun.
- Go snake-eyed.
- Do what?
Like this.
Like this.
AII right.
Now...
Draw and shoot that bottIe before you touch the gun.
How can I draw and shoot the gun before I touch it?
Concentrate. Try it.
Hot damn! Yeah.
Caroline was right,
lt is possible to shoot a gun
before you touch it,
'Course, it takes lightning reflexes,,,
and considerable
snake-eyed concentration,
Throw up three.
- Why, Hickok himseIf can't hit three.
- Throw up three.
NaturaI-born gunfighter.
So it was l entered
my gunfighter period,
You're crowding me.
I didn't see you. I'm sorry.
It's stupid of me to take up aII that room.
- Set me up with a soda pop.
- Yes, sir. Right away, kid.
The Soda Pop Kid,
that's what they called me,
Soda pop, he wants.
- Anything wrong with that, stranger?
- No, not a thing, friend.
In fact, I admire the styIe of you.
Might I ask who I are addressing?
I'm WiId BiII Hickok.
WeII, I'm...
- I'm pIeased to meet you.
- The pIeasure's mutuaI, friend.
Bring your soda pop over here and sit for a whiIe.
I can break three bottIes throwed in the air.
That's shooting.
How many men have you...
...gunned down?
I don't rightIy recoIIect.
How many have you?
Oh, about...
...two dozen.
- That a fact?
- No, it wasn't a fact at all,
During my gunfighter period,
l was an awful liar,
I wouIdn't have estimated your totaI that high.
No offence intended, but you don't have the Iook of murder in your eye.
Like that buzzard over there.
Him? WeII, he's just a common drunk.
Hm...
What are you so nervous about?
Getting shot.
I got a fuII house!
I got a...fuII house.
Now you've got me doing it.
Sorry.
HoId the fort a whiIe, oId horse, whiIe I get another bottIe.
Did you know the man, BiII?
Never saw the gent before.
Mr Hickok, that man is reaIIy dead.
Got him through the Iungs and heart, both.
SeIIing your gunfighter outfit?
Turning in your gun?
- WeII, sorry, CaroIine.
- There ain't nothing more useIess than a gunfighter who can't shoot peopIe.
Men!
Ah-har!
There went the bosom of my family,
Having tried religion, snake-oil
and gunfighting unsuccessfully,
l took a partner,
become a respectable storekeeper,
and married Olga, a Swedish girl
who couldn't hardly speak no English,
Preserve the moment.
Yes.
OIga, shaII I carry you over the threshoId?
Ja?
- It's a custom.
- Ja?
WeII, it ain't much now, OIga, but me and my partner, we got big pIans.
Free enterprise and honest sweat.
Ja, Ja,
I don't understand this biII.
Looks Iike I'm being charged twice.
Ja, the biIIs of the store.
There must be an error. Jack
AppIebound wouIdn't do that to me.
Jack, enough the biIIs.
Come and get some rest.
I must be making a mistake.
Jack, the rest, the body.
You needs it.
Yeah.
Maybe I do.
Rest.
OIga. OIga, come on.
We'II get out of this somehow.
One little thing about my new
business partner: he was a thief,
(AUC TlONEER) ,,,25 cents for
this glorious musical instrument,
Look at this beautiful instrument,
Who will take it?
- That is a pathetic scene.
- Yes, sir.
A ruined and desoIate famiIy wiped out by economic misfortune.
I find it touching.
l'll never forget the first time
l set eyes
on General George Armstrong Custer,
(OLGA) Ruined! That's what we used to have. Ruined!
Do you have another trade?
WeII, GeneraI, I... Not exactIy.
Then take my advice. Go west.
West?!
- My wife is scared of Indians.
- You have nothing to fear.
I give you my personaI guarantee.
OIga! OIga!
- Hit him! Hit him!
- Sorry, brother.
I think we're going to get away.
- Let me at him! I've got a gun here.
- We must be civiIised.
''And it came to pass after the pIague that the Lord spake...''
Grab the reins! Grab the reins!
- Give it! Give me that shotgun.
- No, it's mine!
- (UNINTELLIGIBLE RANTING )
- Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!
Yee-haa!
Ah! Get back!
Come on, get back!
Jack!
Get back.
I'II protect you.
Aaah... !
OIga!
OIga!
OIga.
l covered most of three states
and hundreds of square miles
looking for Olga, with no luck at all,
- Hey, Crabb.
- Whiskey, whiskey...
For a drink of whiskey, they'II give you a squaw.
Sure save you a Iot of Iooking.
l looked everywhere for my wife
but couldn't find her,
Finally, l had to go deeper
into Cheyenne country,
l didn't figure for me
it was dangerous,
speaking Cheyenne and having
once been a Human Being myself,
- KiII him.
- I didn't steaI, brother.
Why do you caII me ''brother''?
Don't. I am not your brother.
I am a Human Being.
I suppose you wiII say you have never heard of LittIe Big Man.
LittIe Big Man was my brother, but you're not him.
He was kiIIed after rubbing out many bIuecoats.
Did you see the body?
No, he turned into a swaIIow and fIew away.
- Let's kiII him.
- Shadow! You were shot.
I put you on a pony.
I saved you.
Dirt On The Nose, do you stiII have the pony I gave you?
No. The Pawnee stoIe him when we camped at the OId Woman Butte five snows ago.
It is true there is a thing here
I do not understand.
There is a pain between my ears.
My son, to see you again causes my heart to soar Iike a hawk.
Sit here beside me.
Grandfather,
I brought you this present.
Is this the hat I used to own, except grown softer of skin and fatter?
No, grandfather, it's another.
We must smoke to your return.
I saw you in a dream.
You were drinking from a spring that came from the Iong nose of an animaI.
I did not recognise the animaI.
AIongside his nose, he grew two horns, and the water that gushed from his nose was fuII of air.
l can't explain it,
but he was talking
about that elephant-head spigot
in the soda shop,
This wasn't the only time Old Lodge
Skins had dreams that turned out true,
Don't be angry, my son, with
Burns Red, Shadow and the others.
They had many a bad experience with the white man Iast year.
I have thought and taIked and smoked on this matter, and my decision is...
LittIe Big Man has returned.
lt was quite a homecoming,
LittIe Big Man.
lt was Little Horse, the boy
who didn't want to fight the Pawnee,
Don't you remember me?
This hurts me in my heart.
I think I'II cry.
He'd become a heemaneh,
for which there ain't no English word,
And he was a good one, too,
The Human Beings
thought a lot of him,
- HeIIo, Younger Bear.
- Goodbye.
lt was the boy whose life l'd saved,
to his mortal embarrassment,
Did you catch the rabbits on your hunting trip?
No.
Then don't give them to BuffaIo WaIIow Woman.
You see, Younger Bear
had become a contrary,
the most dangerous
of all Cheyenne warriors
because the way they live
drives them half-crazy,
Except for battle, a contrary
does everything backwards,
He says ''goodbye'' for ''hello'',
''yes'' for ''no'',
walks through bushes
instead of on trails,
and washes with dirt
and dries with water,
I thought you were dead.
Why have you come back when nobody wants to see you?
You mustn't speak to LittIe Big Man
Iike that. You owe him a Iife.
I'm gIad I said it. HeIIo.
That was supposed to mean
he was sorry he said it, goodbye,
But that warrior wasn't sorry,
He hated me still,
Grandfather, I have a white wife.
You do?
That's interesting.
Does she cook and work hard?
Oh, yes, Grandfather.
That surprises me.
Does she show pIeasant enthusiasm when you mount her?
WeII, sure, Grandfather.
That surprises me even more.
I tried one of them once, but she didn't show any enthusiasm at aII.
WeII, Grandfather, aII the whites aren't crazy.
I'm gIad to hear that, my son.
- I thought they were.
- Oh, no.
I know of one who is as brave as any Human Being.
I'd Iike to meet this man and smoke with him.
What is he caIIed?
He's caIIed GeneraI Custer.
GeneraI Custer.
- What does the name mean, my son?
- WeII, it means...
- ...''Iong hair''.
- Good name. How did he win it?
He won it in the war of the whites to free the bIack men.
Oh, yes.
The bIack white men.
I know of them.
It is said a bIack white man once became a Human Being.
But mostIy, they are strange creatures.
Not as ugIy as the white, true, but they're just as crazy.
Don't worry, my son.
You'II return to the Human Beings.
I dreamed it Iast night.
I saw you and your wives as you crawIed from one to the other in your tepee.
- Wives, Grandfather?
- Oh, yes. Three or four.
It was dark, and they were hidden under buffaIo robes.
But it was a great copuIation, my son.
The Human Beings onIy take one wife.
How couId I have three or four?
I don't know. It worries me.
l was sure l'd never see him again,
Sir! I expect being a scout is the best way to find my wife, GeneraI.
She was captured when we went west, Iike you advised.
I advised? ImpossibIe.
I've never set eyes on you.
You wouIdn't remember me, sir.
Furthermore, you don't Iook
Iike a scout to me. Not a bit.
A scout has a certain appearance.
Kit Carson, for exampIe.
But you don't have it.
You Iook Iike...
- ...a muIe skinner.
- I know nothing about muIes.
I can teII the occupation of a man by Iooking at him.
Notice the bandy Iegs, the strong arms.
This man has spent years with muIes.
- Isn't that correct?
- WeII, I...
Yes, sir.
- Hire the muIe skinner!
- Yes, sir.
Over here! Come on!
I wouIdn't want my wife back from Indians.
Kindest thing, a buIIet in the brain.
WeII, I don't agree, and I want my wife back.
WeII, one of the Pawnee
Iocated a band of the vermin camped down the river.
We ride in the morning!
Is there any white women with them?
My advice to you is to get yourseIf a IittIe revenge on them bucks.
AII right. Spare the femaIes and chiIdren, if possibIe.
Let's go.
- (BARKING )
- (SCREAMING )
Hey! No!
Hey!
He said spare the women and chiIdren! Give me that!
- Let go of my rifIe.
- The heII I wiII!
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!
I'II kiII you.
lt was downright discouraging,
lf it wasn't lndians
trying to kill me for a white,
it was whites
trying to kill me for an lndian,
lt made me sick, Pawnee scouts
and soldiers was killing everything,
Aah!
Shadow! Brother, Iet's taIk.
Shadow...
I just took care of him.
I'm saving you for the hanging.
There is no describing how l felt,
An enemy had saved my life
by the violent murder
of one of my best friends,
The world was too ridiculous
even to bother to live in it,
That was why Shadow was there
and that was why he'd fought so hard,
l sat and watched that baby
come into this world,
Except for breathing,
that woman made no sound,
lf woman she was,
She didn't look more than a girl,
(BAB Y CRlES )
l couldn't take my eyes
off of that girl and her baby,
AII right, Iet's get the heII out.
Let the Pawnee cIean up.
Now, you Iisten to me.
If you are kin to Shadow, then you know of LittIe Big Man.
I was a friend of the Human Beings untiI they stoIe my wife.
Are you Shadow's wife?
His daughter?
Where's your husband?
KiIIed.
- What's your name?
- Sunshine.
I'm going to take you with me and trade you for my wife.
Near them bushes, Younger.
They're gone. Nobody here.
Let's get the heII out.
Wait here.
HeIIo, Grandfather.
Greetings, my son.
Do you want to eat?
Grandfather?
What happened to your neck?
It's a wound.
It cut the tunneI through which
Iight traveIs to the heart.
You're... You mean you're bIind?
Oh, no.
My eyes stiII see.
But my heart no Ionger receives it.
How did it happen?
White men.
- Where's BuffaIo WaIIow Woman?
- Rubbed out.
And White EIk Woman, too, and Dirt On The Nose, and High WoIf.
- And many others.
- And Burns Red?
Yes.
- Burns Red In The Sun?
- Rubbed out.
His wife, his chiIdren.
- And many more.
- Do you hate them?
Do you hate the white men now?
Do you see this fine thing?
Do you admire the humanity of it?
Because the Human Beings, my son, they beIieve everything is aIive.
Not onIy man and animaIs, but aIso water, earth, stone.
And aIso the things from them,
Iike that hair.
The man from whom this hair came, he's baId on the other side, because I now own his scaIp.
That is the way things are.
But the white men, they beIieve everything is dead: stone, earth, animaIs, and peopIe, even their own peopIe.
If things keep trying to Iive, white men wiII rub them out.
That is the difference.
You wiII stay with us, my son.
A year later, l was still with them,
After wandering all over
in constant danger of being killed
by white settlers or white soldiers,
we come to a place knowed
as the lndian Nations,
lt was a tract of land
by the Washita River
that had been give for ever
to the lndians
by the Congress and
the President of the United States,
We was safe there,
This was lndian land,,,
,,,as long as grass grow
and wind blow and the sky is blue,
Your new son's kicking a Iot today.
I think he wants to come out and see his father.
TeII him to wait untiI I finish my dinner.
I'II teII him, but I don't think he's going to wait much Ionger.
It's good I have a strong, brave husband who brings in so much food.
My strong husband brings in much more than we need.
There are many Human Beings here, many bands from many pIaces.
But it's sad. Many husbands have been rubbed out by the white man.
So women sIeep aIone and cry.
Be quiet now. I'm digesting.
Yes, but I think my sisters are here.
Your what?
My sisters. Digging Bear, LittIe EIk and Corn Woman. I think they're here.
What do you mean, you ''think'' they're here?
I beIieve they are. You bring in much more food than we need.
It is very sad. They have no husbands and they cry.
That's too bad. I'm sorry.
Digging Bear had a baby and Iost it, and so did Corn Woman.
- But LittIe EIk had no baby at aII.
- What do you want me to do about it?
I knew you'd understand.
lt was Old Lodge Skins' dream,
trying to come true,
l was determined
to stay out of them buffalo robes,
Three young and healthy women
with no man for who knows how long,
The very idea kind of shrunk me
like a spider on a hot stove,
Why, it's LittIe Big Man.
Oh, LittIe Big Man.
Younger Bear, it's LittIe Big Man.
He's not a contrary any more.
He has a wife.
She's pIump, she works hard, but she henpecks him.
Just when I think you're dead, you aIways come back.
Yes, and I aIways wiII, tiII you pay me the Iife you owe me.
I've heard you.
Now come to my tepee and eat.
We was caught
in Cheyenne hospitality,
I'm a very important man, more important than you.
I have a wife and four horses.
I have a horse and...
...four wives.
That may be, but my wife, she's a very good one.
See?
Oh, so there you are, you crawIing coyote.
What are we going to eat?
This starved duck?
Oh! Who's the beggar you brought to steaI what IittIe food we have?
CIean it! CIean it!
lt was Olga, l'd found her at last,
One duck.
Olga never did learn much English, but
she sure in hell had learned Cheyenne,
I just don't understand it.
UsuaIIy, this woman is gentIe as a dove.
My words were not the words to speak to a stranger. You stay and eat.
You see what a good wife she is?
It's because I'm a wonderfuI Iover.
Go in my tepee.
She wiII cook for you.
That's aII right. I'm not hungry.
You humiIiated him again.
Goodbye, Younger Bear.
You Iook tired, LittIe Big Man.
Do you want to come into my tepee and rest on soft furs?
Why don't you Iive with me and I'II be your wife?
Thank you for inviting me.
WeII, I've got to fix my hair to sing tonight.
Goodbye, LittIe Big Man.
Goodbye, LittIe Horse.
And so l finally found Olga,
But l had lost her long ago
to the Human Beings
and l saw no good reason
to reveal myself to her now,
Grandfather.
Why have you moved your tepee so far from our band?
The ponies are trying to teII me something.
Last night I had a dream.
The ponies were dying.
I heard them scream.
l'd learned to respect
Old Lodge Skins' dreams,
but for once we were in a safe place,
give to us by treaty,
Why do you hate my sisters?
I don't hate your sisters.
It's just that...
...the Great Spirit teIIs me...
Where are you going?
Your son won't wait any Ionger. He wants to come out and see his father.
Sunshine, lndian style,
was going off to have her baby,
As l watched her walk away,
it come over me that the Great Spirit
wanted me to go in that tepee,
Who wants to be first?
- Who is this here?
- It's me.
WeII, I guess you'II do as weII as any.
l figured she was the littlest one
and it would be easy,
But Lord help us,
them young girls is deadly,
However,
the Great Spirit was with me,
and l survived,
Only thing was, just as l was
about to drift off real peaceful,,,
No, you stay.
- Not yet.
- Maybe I can come back Iater.
ldle boasting, l assure you,
- Who's this here?
- It's me. Digging Bear.
Well, she wasn't called Digging Bear
for nothing, l can tell you that,
Stay here. Corn Woman's too tired.
She don't sound tired to me.
That's not her. That's LittIe EIk.
That's both of them.
LittIe EIk, you go to sIeep.
You too. Digging Bear...
Corn Woman, where are you?
l was lucky l come across her last,
The others, too?
Yes.
I knew you were a good man.
Here's your new son.
l reckon right then l come close
to turning pure lndian,
and l probably would have spent
the rest of my days
with Sunshine and her sisters,
- But sometimes grass don't grow,
- (WHINNYING )
wind don't blow
and the sky ain't blue,
Something's wrong with the ponies.
WoIves. Grandfather's...
Here. Go inside.
Don't Ieave the tepee.
- (WHINNYING )
- (RUMBLE OF HOOVES )
Grandfather, what's wrong with the ponies?
Don't you hear that, my son?
I wonder why I didn't see them in my dream.
Sunshine! Sunshine!
Grandfather, you've got to get inside.
Why bother, son?
It's a good day to die.
We've got to get to the river bank!
I am bIind. I cannot fight.
But I won't run.
If it's my day to die,
I want to do it here, within a circIe.
Grandfather, the river is part of the great circIe of the waters of the earth.
True, but the soIdiers wouId kiII us before we got to the river.
The soIdiers? Grandfather, you didn't see any soIdiers in your dream, and that means that they can't see you now.
- You think so?
- Yes! What eIse did your dream mean?
- I think you're right.
- Let's go to the circIe of the river!
I've never been invisibIe before.
- It's too Iate. We're cut off.
- It doesn't matter. We're invisibIe.
Grandfather, wait!
Grandfather!
lt sounds ridiculous, but the soldiers
never lifted a hand to stop us,
lt was so crazy,
they couldn't figure it out,
Maybe they thought
we was prisoners or friendlies,
since Old Lodge Skins
was grinning at them like a raccoon,
Or maybe we really was invisible,
All l knowed is we walked
right through them to the river,
CircIe the camp!
CircIe the camp, boys!
- That was extremeIy enjoyabIe.
- GIad you Iiked it, Grandfather.
Captain!
- Captain, shoot the Indian ponies.
- I beg your pardon, sir?
That is my decision.
Shoot the ponies.
- Sunshine.
- Yes, sir.
Young man, your seIf-righteous piety is commencing to annoy me.
- I didn't say anything.
- Shooting ponies shocks you?
Let me teII you, the women are more important than the ponies.
They breed Iike rats.
However, this is a IegaI action, and the men are under strict orders not to shoot the women.
UnIess, of course, they refuse to surrender.
- Isn't that correct?
- Yes, sir.
Sunshine!
Run! Run!
Run!
No! No!
- Where you going?
- Message for the GeneraI.
Wait a minute.
- What's that on your face?
- Mud, sir.
That's not mud. That's Indian paint.
And that's an Indian knife.
- What's your company?
- My company, sir?
Yes, and your commanding officer.
- What's the troubIe, Captain?
- We've got a renegade.
He's wearing Indian paint and he doesn't know his company.
- Take him away and hang him.
- GeneraI!
Don't you remember me?
I'm Jack Crabb, the muIe skinner!
- MuIe skinner?
- Yes. I appIied for a job as scout, but you couId teII my true occupation just by Iooking at me.
Yes, I beIieve I do remember that.
How did you become a renegade?
GeneraI, I ain't no renegade!
I was captured by the Cheyenne and heId prisoner!
Why, they took cactus thorns and stuck them in me!
But I just Iaughed and begged them to keep on doing it!
- You Iaughed?
- I Iaughed my head off.
Otherwise I wouIdn't be here.
GentIemen, it is difficuIt to admit to an error.
Captain.
Your summary judgement was whoIIy mistaken!
Aren't you gIad I questioned this man more cIoseIy?
Yes, sir.
PIease be more carefuI in the future, Captain.
- I'II drink the tea now, CorporaI.
- Yes, sir.
What are you doing up here, muIe skinner?
Nothing.
I just brought you tea, GeneraI.
And I...
...wanted to thank you again for sparing my Iife.
Why are you standing to the side?
Turn this way.
You came up here to kiII me, didn't you?
And you Iost your nerve.
WeII, I was correct in a sense.
You are a renegade, but you are no Cheyenne brave.
Custer was right,
l was a total failure as an lndian,
Do I hang you?
I think not. Get out of here.
- You're not going to hang me?
- Your miserabIe Iife is not worth a reversaI of a Custer decision.
That was the worst thing
he could have done to me,
There was nothing left
of my self-respect at all,
l couldn't go back to the lndians,
so l went back among the whites
and become a drunk,
Oh, you're a sad sight, Hoss.
You shouId have stuck to soda pop.
- How are things with you, BiII?
- Fine.
- I've changed my ways, Hoss.
- That's good.
Hey, BiII, I need a drink worse than the breath of Iife itseIf.
Here's $20. Get gIoriousIy drunk.
But first, go to the barber and have yourseIf a bath.
And buy some cIothes.
Then come see me in the saIoon.
One thing I do know, Hoss.
Any fooI can drink himseIf to death.
I'd Iike to ask you a confidentiaI favour.
It's a deIicate matter invoIving a widow.
She needs a train ticket out of town.
- You give her this.
- Sure, BiII.
You see, my new, beautifuI wife is vioIentIy jeaIous.
And this widow...
Oh, she's quite a widow.
- I think I know what you mean, BiII.
- Her name is LuIu Kane.
- Right now, BiII.
- Good.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
- BiII!
- He kiIIed my daddy!
He kiIIed my daddy! He ain't never going to shoot nobody again!
It took me seven years, but I got him!
- Who was he, anyhow?
- Some boy.
Hoss, you know that matter we discussed?
- The widow?
- Yes, BiII.
Don't teII my wife.
That'd reaIIy get me in troubIe.
You got me down in this goddamn water.
- (BELL)
- You quit it right now,
Come in, stranger.
Whatever it is you want, we've got it.
Mrs Pendrake?
You've mistaken me for someone eIse, stranger.
My name is LuIu.
Your name ain't LuIu.
You're Louise Pendrake.
- Who are you?
- Why, I'm Jack Crabb.
Mrs Pendrake, don't you remember me?
Jack Crabb?
My God.
Jack.
This is quite a pIeasant surprise.
This room is more commodious.
What have you been doing?
LuIu! What are you doing, sitting on your arse?
- A gentIeman is waiting.
- I have a gentIeman here, too.
Oh. I didn't see you, stranger.
Need anything?
If you do, just ring the beII.
Our motto here is: whatever you want, we've got it.
WeII, Jack. Now you know.
This is a house of iII fame, and I'm a faIIen fIower.
That widow hadn't lost her style
one bit,
A fallen flower,
Chokes me up to think about it,
This Iife is not onIy wicked and sinfuI.
It isn't even any fun.
No, I reckon not, Mrs Pendrake.
Yet, if I was married and couId come here once or twice a week, it might be fun.
But every night, it's just boring.
Oh, I can understand that.
I can't save any money.
If I couId just save a few doIIars,
I couId visit my maiden aunt in Washington.
I'd have cIothes, a carriage...
I might even marry a senator.
Oh! You'd make a good wife for a senator, Mrs Pendrake.
You aIways were a sweet boy.
Do you know, I often had wicked thoughts about you?
SeveraI times.
I aImost gave in to temptation.
And now, here we are.
Mrs Pendrake, what are you doing?
Do you know that, once,
I tiptoed into your room and stood over you for the Iongest time?
It was the most awfuI temptation to wake you up.
I wish that I had.
It wouId have been deIiciousIy wicked.
Is anything the matter, Jack?
- No.
- Then I'II wait for you in the...
...pIace of retirement.
You shouId have woke me up that night years ago, Mrs Pendrake.
This is from WiId BiII.
It was his Iast wish that you go and Iive with your maiden aunt.
His Iast wish was to save me?
Oh, Jack.
I must honour that wish.
You can do it, Mrs Pendrake.
Yes. I can, and I wiII.
I've got to go now.
Goodbye, Mrs Pendrake.
Oh, goodbye, Jack.
And thank you ever so much.
And, Jack...
If you're ever in Washington, do Iook me up.
- How are things, Mr Meriweather?
- SpIendid.
WeII, now, Iook at that.
BuffaIo hides.
There's a worId of money chewing grass on those pIains, Jack.
There goes BuffaIo BiII himseIf.
Yes, sir. MuItipIy that by thousands.
The buffaIo are getting scarce.
You were raised by Indians.
You shouId know how to track them.
We couId make a kiIIing, Jack.
- Haven't changed a bit, Jack.
- Neither have you.
You'd better watch out.
They're whittIing you down.
You can't afford to Iose any more of your parts.
Every business has a particIe of risk.
Bye, dear boy.
That was my low,
l had reached the bottom,
l become a hermit,
l went deep in the wilderness,
as far away as l could get,
Then one day, l found something
trappers see fairly regular,
An animal had gnawed off
its own foot to escape from a trap,
Something snapped in my head,
l decided life wasn't fit to live,
and the only thing to do was
to mingle with the twinkling stars,
Goodbye, Jack.
At that moment, l really was crazy,
and l was darn near off that cliff
when,,,
The time had come
to look the devil in the eye
and send him to hell
where he belonged,
The only question was
how to get him there,
Sergeant, take this man...
...and give him some cIothes.
This man wiII be invaIuabIe to me,
Major.
InvaIuabIe, sir?
I aImost hanged him as a renegade.
Now he asks to be a scout.
Oh, his game is very obvious: to Iead me away from his Indian friends.
WeII, I stiII don't quite foIIow you,
GeneraI.
Anything that man teIIs me wiII be a Iie.
Therefore, he wiII be a perfect reverse barometer.
- Isn't that correct?
- Of course, GeneraI.
ln my belief, Custer's hate
for the lndians and his ambition
had combined on him,
He figured he needed one more
dramatic victory over the lndians
to be nominated for
President of the United States,
That is a historical fact,
Men, hoId!
- We wiII take brief refreshment.
- Dismount!
Water break!
Oh, excuse me, Lieutenant.
It's the ceIibacy of the saddIe.
I had muscIe spasms aII night.
- Poison from the goonads.
- Poison from the what, sir?
Goonads. That's medicaI terminoIogy.
GeneraI, it's my duty as your...
The poison rises from the goonads and seeps down to the muscIes.
The Crows want to know if you're going down the Medicine TaiI CouIee.
- They do, do they?
- Yes, sir, they do.
They cIaim they want time to sing their death song.
TeII the Crows they're women.
But if the hostiIes come in behind us, and if they're waiting for us beIow, we'II never get out of there.
HostiIes behind us?
I see no hostiIes behind us.
Do you see any?
- No, sir, not at the moment.
- Then...
...stop trying to cause a reversaI of a Custer decision.
But, sir, wouIdn't it be best to send a squad down Medicine TaiI CouIee?
- No, it wouIdn't.
- May I ask, sir, why it wouIdn't?
Because it wouId cost us the vitaI eIement of surprise.
Surprise?
They know we're here.
But they don't know that
I intend to attack them without mercy.
- That's no surprise.
- Of course it is.
Nothing is more surprising than the attack without mercy.
GeneraI...
GeneraI, I must protest this impetuous decision.
A Custer decision, impetuous?
Grant caIIed me impetuous, too!
That drunkard, sitting there in the
White House, caIIing me impetuous!
GeneraI, I impIore you to reconsider.
Think of the men whose Iives depend upon you.
What shouId I do, muIe skinner?
Sir, that man doesn't know anything.
What do you say, muIe skinner?
ShouId I go down there, or withdraw?
l had him,
But this time what l held in my hand
wasn't a knife, but the truth,
WeII?
What's your answer, muIe skinner?
GeneraI, you go down there.
- You're saying, go into the couIee?
- Yes, sir.
There are no Indians there,
I suppose?
I didn't say that.
There are thousands of Indians down there, and when they get done with you, there won't be nothing Ieft but a greasy spot.
This ain't the Washita River, GeneraI, and them ain't heIpIess women and chiIdren waiting for you.
They're Cheyenne Brave, and Sioux.
You go down there if you got the nerve.
StiII trying to outsmart me, aren't you, muIe skinner?
You want me to think that you don't want me to go down there, but the subtIe truth is you reaIIy don't want me to go down there.
WeII, are you reassured now, Major?
Men of the Seventh!
The hour of victory is at hand!
Onward to LittIe Bighorn and gIory!
We've caught them napping!
Sound the charge!
We have them on the run!
Take no prisoners!
(BUGLE SOUNDS
ABOVE BATTLE NOISE)
Get off of your knees, men! Custer's with you! Custer's up! Stay with me!
What are they doing?
- Why aren't they charging?
- There's nowhere to charge to.
FooIs! They're shooting their own horses!
Arrest them! Arrest them!
- BugIer! Sound the charge!
- We've got to make breastworks!
I know aII about that, Major.
Don't try to teII me my business.
Make breastworks, men!
Show them no mercy!
I said, give them a voIIey!
- We're running out of ammunition.
- Right.
Now we are running out of ammunition.
I toId him this wouId happen.
But he just sat there in the White House and Iaughed at me.
That damned Cossack.
This is horribIe.
We're being wiped out!
Go on, Christian America!
Let your arrows fIy, savages!
I am unbowed!
Mr President!
Mr President, distinguished visitors, honoured members of the Senate, taking the Indian as we find him, waiting...
Why don't you shut up?
Mr President, you are drunk.
We can't have a man Iike you in the White House!
Get on your feet and face the enemy!
- Go away, GeneraI.
- AII right.
The sentence is death.
AII right. You and I are even at Iast.
I paid you the Iife I owe you, and, the next time we meet, I can kiII you without becoming an eviI person.
He goes to dance his joy.
Grandfather.
I am gIad to see you.
I'm gIad to see you, too, my son.
My heart soars Iike a hawk.
Do you want to eat?
I won't eat with you because I'm going to die soon.
Die, Grandfather?
Yes, my son.
I want to die in my own Iand, where
Human Beings are buried in the sky.
Why do you want to die, Grandfather?
Because there's no other way to deaI with the white man, my son.
Whatever eIse you can say about them, it must be admitted, you cannot get rid of them.
No, I suppose not, Grandfather.
There is an endIess suppIy of white men, but there aIways has been a Iimited number of Human Beings.
We won today.
We won't win tomorrow.
Snake Woman, get me my eIk buriaI robe.
Come, my son. We wiII go.
It makes my heart sad.
A worId without Human Beings has no centre to it.
Go where, Grandfather?
To the mountain, to the top.
Come out and fight.
It is a good day to die.
Thank you for making me a Human Being.
Thank you for heIping me to become a warrior.
Thank you for my victories and for my defeats.
Thank you for my vision and the bIindness in which I saw further.
You make aII things and direct them in their ways, O Grandfather.
And now, you have decided the
Human Beings wiII soon waIk a road...
...that Ieads nowhere.
I am going to die now, unIess death wants to fight.
And I ask you for the Iast time to grant me my oId power to make things happen.
Take care of my son here.
See that he doesn't go crazy.
(RAINDROPS FALL
ON OLD LODGE SKINS )
Grandfather?
Am I stiII in this worId?
Yes, Grandfather.
I was afraid of that.
WeII...
...sometimes the magic works, sometimes it doesn't.
Let's go back to the tepee and eat, my son.
My newest Snake wife cooks dog very weII.
AII right, Grandfather.
She aIso has a very soft skin.
The onIy troubIe with Snake women is they copuIate with horses, which makes them strange to me.
She says she doesn't. That's why
I caII her Doesn't Like Horses.
But, of course, she's Iying.
Of course, Grandfather.
Well, that's the story
of this old lndian fighter,
That's the story of the Human Beings,
who was promised land
where they could live in peace,
Land that would be theirs
as long as grass grow,
wind blow,
and the sky is blue,
Mr Crabb, l didn't know,
Get out, get out.

ENGLISH SDH
Three hundred?
Not a happy figure, Herr Schmidt.
You guaranteed seven hundred and fifty.
I don't care what your problems are.
Look, you fulfill your contract.
Seven hundred and fifty, all in prime condition, on the job.
In Dusseldorf. Monday.
Smoke bother you?
Where there's smoke there's fire.
Brighten my day.
Call back.
Mr. Amafi.
Just one moment.
Good morning, Mr. Amafi.
Schmidt's making a delivery on Monday.
Seven hundred and fifty to Dusseldorf.
From the Ivory Coast?
Only three hundred.
The rest from Senegal.
Tell Angelo to come in.
And get yourself a cup of coffee.
Yes, Mr. Amafi.
Yes?
Names, dates, places.
He's been a busy boy.
Are you sure he's the Emir's son?
It took some persuasion, but he finally talked.
For the benefit of the others, an example has to be made.
Kill him.
What about his father?
He's got a lot of clout.
He can't throw a spear all the way from New York, now can he?
"Kill him. "
What's happening?
Some Africans are looking for you.
I don't know any Africans, brother.
You come!
- Central Answering, can I help you?
- Yeah, baby. Anything?
- Is that you, Mr. Shaft?
- That's right.
A Mr. Ramila's been calling you every 10 minutes since 2:00.
You come.
You tell Mr. R, if he calls again, that I got too many friends with troubles.
I don't do business with strangers.
Freeze.
Where did you study stick fighting,
Mr. Shaft?
Conducting the New York Philharmonic.
The Emir will be pleased.
Also by the fact you're already circumcised.
Mr. Shaft, the temperature is 110 degrees.
Are you comfortable?
Shit!
I'd be more comfortable if you'd forget to pay your light bills.
We want you to walk back and forth across the sand for the next eight hours.
If you survive, we will talk.
Man, I already got my tan. Let's talk now!
I said walk! Walk or die!
Very ingenious, Mr. Shaft.
Forgive us, Mr. Shaft.
This is Emir Ramila.
Leader of the Manta tribe in East Africa.
Out of my turf.
This is Wassa, my brain and Ossiat, my strong right arm.
They will prepare you.
Mineral water, Mr. Shaft. Quite pure.
Give me some scotch, man.
I know a great deal about you.
But until tonight, it was all hearsay.
- I had to know.
- Know what?
Would you kill a man?
You fired two shots at Ossiat without hesitation.
Yes, I learned. You would kill a man.
About those shots.
Why is the brother still breathing?
Next time, between the eyes.
How good are you with the stick?
Cat named Shaft ain't gonna be bad with the stick.
From childhood, the men of my tribes used the stick...
...to herd cattle, ward off hyenas, and to fight.
If you were awkward with the stick, it would have taken too long to train you.
Thanks for the offer, but I live in a restricted neighborhood, no hyenas.
You want to call me a cab?
Third question:
Could you survive under desert conditions?
I liked what you did, burying yourself in the sand.
We've found our man, Mr. Shaft.
You!
Okay.
I'll walk.
I make you a most generous offer.
Is that American or Hong Kong?
$15,000 now, $10,000 later.
And what do I have to do?
Become a slave.
Colonel Gondar, John Shaft.
The Colonel is with the Central
Police Authority in Addis Ababa.
He's working with us and with the Organization of African Unity.
A good deal of time and money has been invested in selecting you, Mr. Shaft.
And I guess what you did is looked in the Addis Ababa yellow pages...
...and there I was, John Shaft, investigator. Right?
It was somewhat more involved than that.
What's this slave jive?
Two months ago, a truck crossed the border from Italy into France.
The driver managed to escape.
The French authorities gave the men water and time to rest...
...then hustled them back into Italy and marked the incident closed.
What were they? Italians?
No. Young Africans.
This particular group was smuggled from the Ivory Coast to Italy, then into France.
Smuggled? Why?
To do all the dirty, back-breaking jobs white Europeans refuse to do.
Road gangs, factories, kitchens...
Maybe they needed the bread.
The recruiters are luring thousands of young Africans into Europe every month.
They've no work permits, no social security.
If they complain, they're deported.
They work a 16-hour day, 7 days a week, for literally pennies.
This, Mr. Shaft, is slavery in the 20th century.
Then just arrest the cats who are hustling the people and that's the end of that.
We want the men at the top.
We need a trained investigator.
Somebody they don't know.
To infiltrate their organization.
To do this, he has to let himself be recruited in Africa.
So, get an African investigator.
They know all our men.
- Get someone who's not an investigator.
- We did.
My son let himself be recruited in East Africa.
His body was found last week in Paris.
In a ditch.
An uptown dude like me.
They'd spot me a mile away.
Not if you're briefed in tribal ways.
And learn the Manta dialect.
I was 21 before I found out that "isn't" is another way of saying "ain't. "
Aleme, come in.
This is my daughter, Aleme.
Aleme has come to instruct you, Mr. Shaft.
They vanished as mysteriously as they appeared.
But they left behind our spoken culture...
...their drums, their copper spears, their beaded crowns.
Nobody knows what happened to them.
But our tribes are descended from these proud ancestors.
Don't laugh, Mr. Shaft.
Your survival depends on how much you can remember.
Who's laughing?
I was just thinking, they made us study Shakespeare in school.
Was he ever a Johnny-come-lately...
...compared to your cats grooving on poetry a thousand years ago.
Sure blow their minds at P.S. 64!
Our officials fall into two categories.
Macha. Tulama.
Not bad. You are progressing.
Why don't you get rid of that Jolly Giant there...
...so that you and I can get down to the finer strokes?
Ossiat has guarded me since I was a child.
Sometimes I think of him as my living chastity belt.
Damn!
Man that size, baby.
That's a whole lot of chastity.
I'm still in my first age-grade.
We call that Fareita.
No one is permitted to marry while they're in Fareita.
What do you do for relaxation?
I enter Chela, my second age-grade, this February.
Then, even the Emir's daughter may have sex and marry.
After my clitoridectomy.
Your what?
My clitoridectomy, female circumcision.
You mean, when they cut off your...
Are you afraid to say the word?
My clitoris?
Yes.
That's what they do in the time of Chela.
Hell, no wonder the natives get restless.
The emphasis in our marriages is not upon sexual pleasure...
...but upon the rearing of children.
Listen, baby...
February's just around the corner.
How are you going to know what you're missing unless...
...you give it a little wear and tear before they take it away?
- Are you volunteering?
- You're damn right.
Do not kiss!
Where's your stick?
It's time for your lesson.
Shit!
It's back there. Why don't you get it for me while I warm up?
Tingat. Wulan.
Saho.
Here is your first payment, Mr. Shaft.
A check for $15,000.
And your airline ticket.
You leave in the morning!
From up here it doesn't look so big, does it?
I mean, New York. It's not so big.
LA's got more square miles.
Tokyo and London both have more people.
Oh, you don't speak English.
You must be African.
Manta.
My name's Williams.
If there's anything you need, let me know.
Standard Oil?
By god! Now, that's something!
Can't speak the language, but knows about Standard Oil!
How about General Motors?
Coca Cola.
Are you okay, Mr. Shaft?
Go catch your plane to Addis.
Who are you?
I'm not with Standard Oil.
Then I guess he's not with Coca Cola.
Thanks.
"He will never live to reach Africa. "
Yet I am told he's already boarded Ethiopian Airlines...
...Flight 175, at Orly, en route to Addis Ababa.
How can you explain that?
They had somebody with him out of New York.
He took my man by surprise.
Shaft was simply lucky.
First editions always worry me.
Luck can run out, even for you, my black brother.
Consider him a dead man.
I was under the impression you were to kill whoever the Emir hired in New York.
Wasn't that our agreement?
The Emir might have suspected me.
This man, Shaft, seemed too dangerous on his home ground.
But in Africa...
Picture, sir?
He's quite tame.
I hope you'll both be very happy.
Colonel Gondar sent me.
This way, please, sir.
We have a choice of poses. You can kneel and put your arms around him.
You can straddle and ride him.
Or you can put your head in his mouth.
Is that right?
You are to go at once.
Thank you, sir. Keep the receipt.
I'll see you get your picture tomorrow.
Sorry for this cloak-and-dagger business.
The incident at Orly gave us a nasty shock.
That incident at Orly gave me a nasty shock!
You trust her?
She's a cousin of mine.
I'll never turn my back again on a cleaning woman.
Who was the cat in drag who tried to kill me?
A Sardinian named Bocco.
An assassin with a long criminal record.
And the dude who saved my ass?
He works with us.
Well, it seems we've brought you a long distance for nothing.
Obviously, the opposition knows about you.
If you choose to call it off, we'll understand.
What, and blow $25,000?
Only money brings you here?
Hell, no. I just love having my picture taken with lions.
Your forebearers were dragged in chains from this continent...
...and dumped onto the cotton plantations of America.
I'd think you'd want the assignment for stronger motives than money.
You're wrong! My folks weren't in cotton.
They were in tobacco.
The Emir tells me you've learned how to use this.
This particular fighting stick is a rather special one.
Thirty-six exposures. Extra film in here.
You'll leave your bag with me and take this one.
There's food in here and this.
Tape recorder.
To record, turn clockwise.
To stop recording, turn it back.
Wait a minute. I'm not James Bond.
Simply Sam Spade.
Wear that pouch around your waist.
Under this robe.
- I hope that's a 40 long.
- You'll be living in it.
With these sandals, until the recruiters issue you Western work clothes.
If you get that far.
What about some iron?
Iron?
A piece.
No gun.
Too difficult to hide and a dead giveaway if somebody searches your bag.
Anyway, you've got your stick.
Is that right?
We've selected a zabana who speaks English. He won't leave your side.
- A"zabana"?
- A bodyguard.
If a gun is too conspicuous, a bodyguard will be like putting it on the 6:00 news.
Once you leave Ethiopia, you'll be in a territory...
...where everybody has zabanas.
Even the zabanas have zabanas.
Yours is named Kopo.
He will join you along the way.
Study this.
It's a route we've laid out which should bring you into contact with the recruiters.
If you live long enough to get to Paris, there's a telephone number written here.
Memorize it and call the moment you arrive.
And burn that map and that number before you leave this room.
I wish you luck. God knows you'll need it.
Here!
That's all! Got to make it last.
Spot! Come here!
Come here!
Dummy, come here!
Follow me.
No one will see us.
My people build these nests to keep crows away from the corn.
Is that a fact?
The farmer gets up here and fires away.
How did you get rid of your big shot,
Old Ossiat?
He just had his sixth child. So I slipped away while he was celebrating.
I passed your bus near the border, but when I got there you weren't on it.
Only that dead man.
So I doubled back.
I had to see you.
John, they know who you are.
Well, I figured that. They already tried to kill me twice.
Don't worry, they can't make it.
Were you disappointed I wasn't a virgin?
Hell no, baby.
You had some good teachers.
John...
This is hardly the time to talk about it...
...but I've made an important decision because of you.
Well, my daddy told me, he said, "John...
"... the one time you should never ever make an important decision...
"... is right after you've made love. "
It's about my clitoridectomy.
That's an important decision, all right.
When February comes,
I'm not going to let them do it.
I am Kopo, your zabana.
Put out your hand.
What is the meaning of this gesture?
It just means,
"Brother, I am glad to see you! "
Come!
- What was that all about?
- He's the district headman.
Everything that happens around here he knows.
He says the white man this week takes our people...
...from the town of Maiberra to the north.
Then we go north.
He says that in Maiberra, when the sun stands two more times above our heads...
...two men will die.
Maiberra?
Get in line! Get in there! Move in!
Sign.
What I sign?
Sign you say you give back money.
Food, clothes, boat.
How much you pay me?
200 francs each month.
What's your name?
Jowi.
Okay, Jowi.
Jowi!
Take your dog and bury him.
Nobody's ever cried for you, have they, baby?
Nobody even knows you're gone.
Son of a bitch, you know who I am, don't you? Who told you?
Who sent that cat after me at the airport?
And on the bus?
Talk, motherfucker, talk!
"Marco Sassari. "
Another late, not-so-great Sardinian.
Died December 12 from a stiff neck...
...in a town called Maiberra...
...as the sun stood overhead.
The headman said that two men would die.
He was wrong.
Only one man died...
...and two dogs.
Quick, come! We go! Come!
Now! All of you!
This Zubair.
He take you cross desert.
I no forget you.
You speak English?
Little.
Ziba, you beat him?
I beat.
Good. I don't like Ziba.
You ride front with me.
You know how to ride camel?
No ride camel. Ride ass.
You learn to ride camel.
I show you. Come on.
Sit here. Cross leg, like this.
See? Easy. Now you.
Cross leg! Cross leg! Cross!
Slow down.
I'd give ten years of my life if I could do that.
To be able to see the world only in sexual terms.
And to feel it, the way you do, Jazar.
Such diligence, Mr. Wassa. I'm impressed.
Imagine, you flying all the way from Africa to be sure your laborers are doing well.
Look at them.
Happy in their work.
Are you happy in your work?
Piro and Sassari are both dead.
Shaft killed them.
The last time we talked it was Shaft's life or yours.
He will be boarding Vanden's boat tomorrow morning.
I flew in to ask you to contact Vanden.
Get him to delay his departure.
I will not contact Vanden.
He's too weak in the stomach.
I suggest you get down to El Jardia today...
...and deal with Mr. Shaft personally.
May I help?
How?
I could divert his attention while Wassa did whatever he wished to do.
The real reason, my pet.
I'm bored. I need some excitement.
We both do.
Listen, Mr. Wassa.
I don't love this young lady.
I don't even particularly like her.
But she's the only person in the world
I've ever found who can get it up for me.
I want her back by Friday of this week.
If anything should happen to her...
...or if Shaft is still breathing by this time tomorrow...
...I'll have you killed...
...wherever you happen to be.
The young lady will meet you at the airport in one hour.
I wish I could watch you with Shaft.
Where will you do it?
On the boat.
I like the way it rocks you back and forth.
Get it on tape. Play it back for me Friday.
That's a delicious idea!
If you do it, I'll buy you an emerald.
How large an emerald?
Boat come tomorrow.
You be here first light.
Now, you go to town.
Get girls. Buy gifts for home.
No money.
I give. You sign paper. You pay later.
Hey! You, my guest. Good shot.
You come to town with me.
No. Leave it here. It's safer.
Where we go, the girls, they steal!
No wonder they call Africa the Mother Country!
But, Mama, I ain't gonna fight it.
Where's Jowi?
Come on!
Ciao, baby.
I want names, baby!
I want to know every name you know!
Who's paying you and who sent you after me?
If I tell, they kill me!
What the fuck do you think I'm going to do.
Now, talk!
I'm your friend.
I kill the man who sent me.
I do this for you.
Talk! Talk!
Now, talk, or I'll break the other one!
Next time, you mother, don't bite off more than you can chew.
All that lot?
I am to be paid for 41.
What do you think we're running, the Queen Mary?
I am to be paid for 41!
- A hundred more.
- For what?
I bring you happy men.
They sign, you pay.
Stow it, Sadi!
The man's entitled to his money.
That's the contract.
Any expenses advance have to be collected on delivery before the next leg of the trip.
Don't worry.
We'll get it back when we dock.
May Allah be with you.
All right, gentlemen!
Everyone into the hold!
Come on, move it!
Sadi, get them stowed below.
Get them out of those robes and into work clothes!
Well?
When did he bathe last?
Very soon now, in 500 feet of water.
Not until I spend the night with him.
What if he hurts you?
I'm counting on it.
If anything happens to you,
Amafi will kill me.
If I don't get to spend the night with this man...
...I'll tell Amafi you raped me.
You know what he'd do to you?
When it's dark, have the Captain bring them up on the deck...
...in small groups, for fresh air...
...and for exercise.
They are going to kill you.
Don't pretend you don't understand.
You are John Shaft.
Jowi. Jowi.
Look, Mr. Shaft, I am offering you life.
Why?
If you help me...
...I'll help you.
Your place or mine?
I do hope you're not looking for the shower.
I like natural men.
Who's planning to kill me?
Wassa.
So that's where it leaked.
How long is your phallus?
My what?
Your cock.
Baby, by now it's shrunk down to 20 inches.
Wassa, that son of a bitch!
You can usually tell by the size of a man's nose.
Or the length and thickness of his thumbs.
I always look for a man with prominent nose...
...and long, thick thumbs.
Baby, you're not turning me on.
I got too many things on my mind.
A man who's been in the desert as long as you have?
You know...
...the man who pays my bills...
...thinks I'm oversexed.
And whatever gave him that idea?
Baby, this just may blow your mind, but I ain't about to fuck you.
I'm taking you out of here now, as a hostage.
Do it later. Please.
Please.
Move it, baby.
No hidden gun. Look for yourself.
We've been recorded.
By what network?
He asked me to put our love affair on tape.
What's his name?
If I tell you, will you come to bed?
Tell me first, and then I'll decide.
He's the one you are looking for.
Vincent Amafi.
Head of the whole business.
You're going to take me to him, yes?
I know he'd like to meet you.
Where is he?
Paris.
Paris.
We may as well be comfortable together...
...while we cross the Med.
What's your name?
Does it matter?
My God!
Baby, my nose may not be too prominent...
...but I've got two of the longest, thickest thumbs...
You saved Amafi the trouble.
Get dressed, baby!
Why?
There's a motorboat on deck.
We're taking it for a ride.
You know something?
You're the first man who's ever made love to me the way a man should.
Fantastic, baby.
Write my congressman later.
Come on, get dressed!
Whatever you say, John.
Untie it!
John!
Thanks, baby.
- Hello?
- Your call, Mr. Amafi.
Oh, yes, Operator. Put him on.
Good morning, Captain.
A bloody rotten morning!
Wassa's dead, shot to death.
My first officer deserted at sea.
The police are due any minute.
And the girl?
Who the hell knows?
Probably gone off with Sadi.
The men you brought across, where are they now?
In the trucks, on the way to Paris!
Where else should they be?
Idiot! You let them go?
Listen, with a goddamned corpse aboard...
...and a hold full of illegal Africans, how could I explain them to the police?
This is going to cost you extra money,
Mr. Amafi.
Otherwise, from now on, you can get yourself another captain.
Angelo.
Come on! Come on!
Perreau is here!
Your friend Perreau is here!
Come on! Listen to Perreau!
Me, Perreau. Your friend.
Me tell you what to do...
...where go, where work.
I pick up money. Your money.
Save you time.
Pay back cost of your journey...
...this room, clothes, food.
Perreau, I take care everything.
Now, this room cost you each
100 francs a month.
We only earn 200 francs a month.
But this room, we pay half?.
No space in Paris. Very costly.
No room, you in street.
In street...
...police come.
Ask question. Send you home.
But, how you go home?
Owe money!
So, go prison.
Lock up.
100 francs a month, everybody stay happy! No?
This is a clock. Alarm clock.
Perreau set time.
You sleep three hours.
Then, clock ring. You get up.
I come, pick you up, we go work.
Here... francs!
Francs for soap...
...candy...
You divide.
Three hours.
I come back.
We friends of Jowi. Jowi here?
Jowi?
Jowi! Jowi!
Jowi not here! Oyo, his friend, that room!
Oyo? Your name Oyo?
Inspector Cusset...
...John Shaft.
A pleasure, monsieur.
All of us are impressed...
...and grateful.
Pictures and tapes...
...starting with the cat who tried to take my seat on the bus in Addis...
...ending right here in Paris with a little gopher named Perreau.
- He'll pick us up in three hours.
- We'll process this immediately.
Then, if you are not too tired...
...a police stenographer will take down your entire statement.
- I'm not too tired.
- Perreau? The name is unknown to me.
But, a little gopher, you say, coming to pick you up.
Surely he can't be the kingpin of African recruiting.
Kingpin's a cat named Vincent Amafi.
Another unknown name.
We'll see if we find a monsieur Amafi and put him under surveillance.
I'll find him.
I'm grateful, monsieur, but from now on we will do the work.
I've got a personal thing with Mr. Amafi.
I remind you, monsieur, you are now back in a civilized country...
...where due process of law prevails.
Inspector, I resent that implication.
My country was building churches while your people were still living in caves.
Forgive me, Colonel.
I didn't mean to imply-
Get your stenographer and I'll give her
10 minutes and then I've got things to do.
Amafi did this trying to find me.
The law will punish him.
Fuck the law!
What does it do about the shitheads who charge 100 francs a month...
...to stay in a craphouse like this?
Why don't you really clamp down on the slave trade?
I'll tell you why!
The black ghetto of Paris is as far away...
...from the Champs Elysées as 125th Street is from Park Avenue!
You need a bunch of poor bastards to work on your roads and in your damn kitchens!
So, don't lay any of that law-will-punish-him shit on me!
Alarm clock, she work!
Where do you take the money you collect?
- Where does Amafi do business?
- Perreau, he knows nothing!
Rue Chalet, 11!
Stay here, keep your head down!
Damn close, baby.
- I heard shooting-
- Damn right!
Look around and check those files!
Anything that could lead us to Amafi!
Now, tell us, where is Jowi?
Don't know! Don't know!
Jowi?
This is where they killed him.
Killed who?
My brother. He wrote this in our language.
What does it mean?
Castle.
Mountain.
Fort.
Castle, mountain, fort?
"Château Marquis. Château Michelle.
"Château Montfort.
"Built by Count André Montfort in 1787.
Family residence...
"... until commandeered by German occupying forces.
"Used as Gestapo headquarters and prison from 1942 to 1944."
Where is it?
"Situated 14 kilometers outside of Paris on the main road to Amiens. "
Call Inspector Cusset and tell him where I've gone.
- Has he told you?
- No! Nothing!
You dumb bastards!
Trying to run away, to go to the police!
I've given thousands of jobs to Africans.
They don't complain!
But because of you troublemakers and that bastard, Shaft...
...I have to leave this country. So...
...I'm going to bury you all along with the evidence.
Almost there.
Mr. Shaft?
Yeah, me.
I played the tapes.
I listened to you making love to her.
And her to you.
Why did you have to kill her?
One of your men threw a knife.
She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Then why wasn't her body still onboard ship?
I promised her a boat ride.
Well, she would have liked that.
All right, throw out your iron.
There's only one way out of here.
I've wired this place for demolition.
I've got 40 hostages down below.
Unless you drop your gun and step out where I can see you...
...I'll set off the charges.
You're bluffing, man.
Look down at your feet.
No point in trying to pull those lines.
The wires you can see are for the upper staircase only.
I've got a detonator down here for this half block.
All right?
Out... where I can see you!
Hey, Jowi!
Monsieur, unless you hurry, you are going to miss your plane.
Where does a guy get a cab around here?
Merci.
A I'aéroport.
One of our passengers has asked if you'd mind company.
Put her right here, baby.

Oh, hello there, honey!
- Nice to see you!
- This is my son.
How do you do?
Dorothy, this here's Gil Warren.
- Hi.
- It's so good to see you.
Don't worry, Gil.
She's just shy.
I brought you some tea.
Look! Here they come.
Come on, they're coming!
Shh.
We're getting ready to set the table.
Take these checkers someplace else.
Here, you take these.
Come on, Henry, be careful.
Come on.
- Oh, man, you always drop the checkers when I'm...
- That's the way you win!

Emergency snow alert is now in effect.
No automobiles are to be driven without snow tires or chains.
Winds up to 45 miles per hour...
That was a great dinner, Emma.
- That baby!
- You're a grandpa!
- Our daughter's fine.
- Mmm.
But Dorothy.
Give her time, honey.
Give her time.
Those dishes ain't gonna wash themselves.
Mrs. Warren's son looks real fine, don't he?
Aunt Em, please, no more matchmaking.
Did you make the decision about that new school yet?
It's no decision to make.
But, honey, it's a chance to teach in high school.
Get away from that kindergarten once and for all. It's more money.
But besides the money, it's a chance for you to be with older students.
Almost adults.
- I like it with the kids, Aunt Em.
- I know you do, honey.
And you're a fine teacher.
But that's why I think you'd enjoy teachin' high school.
Have a chance to be with the students for four years...
...such an important time in their development.
I'm really happy with the kids, Aunt Em.
But you been there for three years already.
It's time you got out of that sandbox and into some new people, new neighborhood.
Girl, do you know you're
24 years old and you've...
Never been south of 125th Street?
Well, you haven't.
Oh, here we go again.
You get me so worked up...
...that I'm beginning to sound like a Jewish mother.
I can't see how goin' south of 125th
Street ever made anybody's life better.
And you're never gonna know unless you try, are you?
Come on, Aunt Em, let me do that.
Why don't you go in and relax?
I can do... Let me do that.
Listen, I know gettin' out in that world ain't easy...
...leaving Uncle Henry and me.
But we'll always be here for ya, Dorothy.
And whatever your fears are, well...
...they'll be defeated just by facing up to 'em.
Now, you take that new job and find a place for you and Toto.
It's time for you to make a home of your own.
Toto! Oh! Toto!
Toto! Toto!

- What?
- You know, heavy on the gratitude department.
- Gratitude? For what?
- For curling the curse.
- For leveling the leech.
- For killing our oppressor.
Uh! I never killed nothin' in my life.
- Never killed the point?
- A pint?
- A good story?
- The umpire?
- No!
- Never killed no time?
No, I told you!
I never killed nothin'!
Well, then, I think you graduated...
...from the bush leagues into the majors, girl.
Toto?
Can you dig this?
- Who is it?
- Ain't no more "is"!
Thanks to you, it's a "was"!
- She was Evermean.
- The Wicked Witch from the East.
And they didn't call her Evermean for nothin'!
She was the parks department commissioner!
Caught us paintin' on her playground walls.
- Turned us into graffiti!
- And there we stayed.
- Flat, splat and stuck like that!
- Doomed as cartoons forever.
'Til you burned alphabet through the sky and ended the curse.
- And the "curseress. "
- Givin' a new lease on life to us...
The Munchkins, most recently referred to as the "cursees. "
Toto.
Let's hear it for
Super Witch and her Wonder Dog!
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?
Miss One!
Come to Mama, you hot little digits!
Let me lay my 20-20s on ya!
Oh, how I love you!
Let me... Mmm!
Count the ways!
Oh, mmm! Mmm!
Innumerable blessings, countless felicitations.
Thank you beyond number and additional good stuff!
I didn't mean to...
I didn't mean to kill her.
Oh, don't be all sixes and sevens, honey.
You did the world a multitudinous service by 86ing ol' Evermean.
Bottom line, honey, this chick put the "ugh" in ugly.
But she sure had pretty shoes, didn't she? Yah!
I don't want these shoes.
I wanna go home.
I wouldn't discount those shoes, honey.
And don't ever take 'em off until you do get home.
Remember Miss One told ya.
Oh, pardon me.
Miss One's the name if you haven't guessed by now.
Numbers is my game and now that you've freed us... we can all go back to runnin' our business, ahem.
We can all go back to runnin' our business.
But where am I?
Where am I?
You're in Munchkin Land!
- The indivisible Land of Oz!
- Oz?
But where's my home?
Where's Aunt Em? Where's New York?
- New York?
- 433 Prospect Place.
Ooh! Four, three, three.
You wanna play more than one number today, honey?
I got a freedom special, three numbers for the price...
No, I don't wanna play any numbers.
I just wanna get home!
Oh, well, now that ol'
Evermean's number's up...
...that leaves only three witches in Oz.
One, myself, but my powers don't amount to much.
And number two, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South.
Oh, she's a real star, but you can hardly catch her in.
And number three, the multi-horrored
Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West.
Evermean's even uglier sister!
But I don't think it'd be a good time to ask her for a favor.
So I figured the odds are only the Wiz could cipher how to get you back to...
- Where'd you say that place was?
- The Wiz?
What's a Wiz?
What's a... What's a Wiz?
Oh, darlin', he's the ultimate.
The "X" quotient, the new math.
The common denominator, the main man.
The head honcho!
Bottom line, honey.
Numero uno!
- Where is he? How do I find him?
- Catch this number, honey.

Count your blessings, cut your losses and follow the Yellow Brick Road.
- The Yellow Brick Road?
Yeah! The Yellow Brick Road!
Yellow Brick. Toto!
Remember, don't ever take those shoes off and watch out for the poison poppies!
Wait.

Miss One!

# I wish I was ##
Wait! Mister, please wait!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Succulent and divine!
- Delicious and nutritious.
- Brother crows, this is good stuff!
I'm glad you fellows are enjoying your breakfast.
Is today the day you're gonna help me get down from here?
Help you down?
What is goin' down in that hayloft you call a head?
Didn't we tell you yesterday and the day before that...
- And the day before that...
- That you can't get down?
This is your life, buddy, all hung up!
Besides, Clyde...
...us crows are just thinkin' of you.
There ain't nothin' to get down for!
But I was just thinkin', just once, fellas...
...for a little while to walk in my garden, wouldn't that be terrific?
- Walk!
- You can't walk!
Why, you just a straw paper dummy!
You're right, fellas.
I was just bein' selfish.
And stupid as usual!
- But I was readin' this morning that most people...
- Oh, man!
Look, didn't we tell you readin' was a waste of time?
- But Bacon here said...
- Bacon? Once over lightly, please!
"Knowledge is power. "
- See, and, uh, Cicero, he said...
- Cicero-ro-row!
"More men are ennobled by study than by nature. "
And over here, especially apropos in my situation...
...i. E., stuck up on this here pole:
"Do not accept any situation.
Question, argue and explore. "
Now who you gonna believe?
- Mr. Nobody on that paper?
- Fellas, please!
Or your good friends, the crows?
Yeah, who have dedicated their lives to educatin' you.
- Yeah!
- Sounds to me, fellas...
...like ol' garbage guts here done forgot the crow commandments again.
Fellas, I did not forget the crow commandments. Please!
Run 'em by me!
Run 'em by me.
- Thou shalt honor all crows.
- Right on!
- Proceed!
- Thou shalt stop readin' all bits of paper and literature.
- Trash! Trash!
- And the most important one!
Thou shalt never, never get down off of this here pole!
You got it, Clyde!
And the crow anthem!
I gotta sing that thing again?
# You gotta libretti it
'til you get it #
- # Elucidate #
- # Reiterate #
# And syncopate #
# You can't win
You can't break even #
# And you can't get outta the game #
# People keep sayin' #
# Things are gonna change but they look just like #
# They're stayin' the same #
# You get in way over your head #
# And you only got yourself to blame #
- # You can't win, child #
- # You can't win, child #
# You can't break even #
# You can't get outta the game #
# You can't win
The world keeps movin' #
# And you're standin' far behind #
# People keep sayin' #
- # Things'll get better #
- # Just to ease your state of mind #
# So you lean back #
# And you smoke that smoke #
# And you drink your glass of wine #
# Sayin' you can't win child #
# You can't break even #
# And you can't get outta the game #
# You can't win #
# You can't win no way if your story stays the same #
- # You ain't winnin' #
- # Oh, no #
# But I'd like to see you
I'm awfully glad you came #
# Better cool it
'cause it ain't about losin' #
# Then the world has got no shame #
# You can't win, child #
# Can't break even
Can't get outta the game #
# You can't win
You can't break even #
# Ain't the way it's supposed to be #
- # You'll be spendin' your little bit of money #
- # Oh, no #
# While someone else rides for free #
- # Learned your lesson #
- Ooh!
# Refuel your mind before some turkey blows out your flame #
- # And you can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #
- # You can't win, child #
- # No, you can't win #
# You can't win, child
Can't break even #
# And you can't get outta the game #
# You can't get outta the game #
# You can't get out #
Ooh!
# Of the game #
# No, no, no ##
- I'll, I'll help you down.
- What?
You will?
What's she doing here?
- Get her outta here.
- Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
Shoo, shoo, go on about your business.
Shoo!
Ooh!
- Just hold on.
- This is just an experiment.
The results of the first experiment:
Subject is a hopeless failure.
- You are not.
- I am.
You're just a product of some negative thinking.
First thing we have to do is get rid of these crows.
Come on, Toto, sic 'em!
Shoo! Shoo!
Shoo! Before I call the taxidermist, you turkeys!
Get off me, dog!
Good boy, Toto.
We can go now.
You okay?
Come on! Hey!
Ooh!
I think I'm gonna make it this time.
You sure are.
Just a little self-confidence...
...and coordination.
You're gonna be fine.
You mean, all this time the only thing standing between...
...hangin' up there and livin' it up down here... were those crows?
Well, they told you you couldn't do it and you believed them.
If I only had a brain, I would have figured that out a long time ago.
There you go with that negative thinkin' again.
- Everybody has a brain.
- Uh-uh.
Not me, look.
Oh.
Garbage?
"Lgnorance is the night of the mind...
...a night without moon or star. "
Confucius said that.
I'm on my way to find the Wiz.
He's gonna get me back home.
That's nice. Thank you.
Good luck.
I thought maybe he could get you a brain.
You think that he could...
And Toto and me, we could sure use some company.
Besides, you have nothin' to lose.
I don't, do I?
That was so smart of you!
I wish I thought of that.
Indications are it would be very advantageous for me to join you.
Good.
Um, we only have one problem.
The Munchkins said to follow the Yellow Brick
Road, but I haven't been able to find it.
- Yellow Brick Road?
- There it is!
Hey, wait! Wait!
Did you say, "Yellow Brick Road"?
- Yes!
- Look over here!
We don't need no cabs.
- Say, what's your name?
- My name is... Dorothy.
Dorothy and Toto?
What intelligent names!
Okay, Dorothy and Toto, we're gonna have to find our own Yellow Brick Road.
# Ease on down
Ease on dow... #
- Down the road!
- There it is!
# Ease on down #
- Oh!
- # Ease on... Down #
- Down the road!
- Oh!
# Don't you carry nothin' #

Help!
Help?
Help? Where?
Help! Help!
Over here!
Help!
Hurry! Hurry!
- Where are you?
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Step right up and save a life!
Ooh! Ooh!
I'm in a little bit of a squeeze, brother. Can you give me a hand?
Dorothy?
Oh, how terrible.
- Don't move.
- Don't worry, I wasn't planning any promenades.
We'll be right back.
Oh, he's so brave.
He's probably in shock.
Oh, what I wouldn't give to be in shock... Just once.
I'm so... I'm so sorry.
No apology necessary. I told you nothing hurts me. I have no feelings.
The genius who created me only took care of my dashing good looks...
...my razor sharp wit and my irresistible attraction to the wrong women.
What he forgot to add... was a heart.
But... Everyone has a heart.
Alas, everyone but yours truly.
Hello!
Nobody home in Soulville.
Rid of you!
Free from your posterior prison!
You hulking she devil!
Don't hear ya laughing now.
We were abandoned here when this park went "el foldo. "
Ah, it was a sad day.
There's not much amusement to the closing down of an amusement park.
But yours truly is an old trooper!
I quickly made plans for the future.
But alas, I was felled by my 4th wife, Teenie.
Crushed in my prime!
There, how does that feel?
But that's the whole tragic point, my friends.
# What would I do #
# If I could suddenly feel #
# And to know once again #
# That what I feel is real #
# I could cry
I could smile #
# I might lay back for a while #
- # Tell me what #
- # What #
# What would I do #
# If I could feel #
# What would I do #
# If I could reach inside of me #
# And to know how it feels to say #
# I like what I see #
# And I'd be more #
# Than glad to share #
# All that I have inside of here #
# And the songs my heart might bring #
# You'd be more than glad to sing #
# And if tears should fall from my eyes #
# Just think of all the wounds they could mend #
# And just think of all the time
I could spend #
# Just being vulnerable again #
- # Tell me what #
- # What #
# What would I do #
- # Oh, tell me what #
- # What, what would I do #
- # Oh, tell me what #
- # What #
# What would I do #
# If I could feel ##
I'm just a miserable hunk of junk.
Me!
Once the fastest metal mouth on the midway.
Frozen... ironically in a position
I had assumed all too often.
A seat cushion for Teenie!
Teenie!
- Teenie!
- Dorothy!
- Teenie! Teenie!
- Are you thinkin' what I am?
- Teenie!
- You're so smart!
Teenie! Teen...
You could come with us to see the Wiz.
He's gonna get me back home...
...and he's gonna get the Scarecrow some brains.
Maybe he could get you a heart.
You're not just flimflammin' an ol' flimflammer, are ya?
Could I come with ya?
- Of course.
- "A threefold cord is not quickly broken. "
What's wrong?
He rusted himself cryin'.
Oil! Oil!
- What?
- Oil!
- Find some oil!
- Some oil!
Oil!
# Slide some oil to me #
# Let it trickle down my spine #
# If you don't have STP #
# Crisco will do just fine #
# Slide some to my elbow #
# And to my fingers if you would #
# Slide some oil to me, girl #
# Whoo, don't that feel good #
# Slide some oil to my feet #
# Look-a there
I got toes again #
# Come on slide some oil to my knees #
# And let me see if I can bend #
# Slide some oil to me #
# I'm beginnin' to feel just fine #
# Slide some oil down my throat #
# And let me lubricate my mind #
# Slide some oil to me #
# Go ahead hit my shoulder blades #
# Those who don't have to lubricate #
# Sure got it made #
# Slide some oil to me #
# Let it slip down my side.
# Laying there in one position #
# Sure done made me tired #
Now watch me dance.
Come on, you metal metatarsals, don't fail me now.
Ah-ha! Fall in line and get left behind.
Two bits!
Let me show you my
Saturday night finish!
Oh! Music man!
Let me hear that band!
# Don't turn the water on me #
# Just let me burn and let me lubricate #
# My mind ##
Come on!
# There may be times you think you've lost your mind #
# These steps you're takin' leave you steps behind #
# The road you're walkin' might be long sometimes #
# But you keep on steppin' and you'll be just fine #
# Ease on down ease on down the road #

Hey! Look at me walkin'!
- Stop the music!
- What's the matter? You need more oil?
No! That beast!
He's checkin' us out.
Oh, it's just a statue.
Made of stone, see?
Now even a dummy like me knows a stone lion...
...can't... Check you out.
# Say what you wanna but I'm here to stay #
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #
# Now you can go where you're gonna #
# But don't get in my way
I'm a mean ol' lion #
# You'll be standing in a draft #
# If you don't hear me laugh #
Ha-ha!
# If you have to come around #
# You best not make me frown #
# Or I just might knock you down #
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #
# You know I'm ready to fight and turn your day into night #
# 'Cause I'm a mean ol' lion #
# If you're half bright you'll detour to the right #

Toto!
# Now I'm a mean ol' lion ##
How dare you touch...
...the personage of a king?
You tacky package of horse fodder.
Begone, you overexcited slot machine.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh! You mangy mutt! Oh!
Toto!
Oh!
He bit my paw!
King of the jungle?
- King of the cowards.
- You oughta be ashamed of yourself, scaring us like that.
You big scaredy-cat!
I can't scare anything.
I can't even scare a scarecrow...
...a tin man or a little puppy, anything.
It's no wonder they drummed me out of the jungle.
- I.O.B.K.!
- I.O.B.K.?
Incapable Of Being King!
No! Wait, wait! Wait!
I was exiled in disgrace.
I thought I'd be safe here.
No one would... discover my terrible secret.
Uh, that I'm...
...a lion without any courage!
"Uneasy lies the head...
...that wears a crown. "
W. Shakespeare.
Well, I thought
I'd seen 'em all.
But never, never have I seen...
...a lion... without courage.
Lion!
Lion!
Maybe the Wiz could give you some courage.
- It's a good idea.
- Capital suggestion.
- Capital! He's gonna get me a heart.
- And me some brains.
Come with us to Emerald City.
I'd love to, but I can't.
But why?
Because... I'm scared!
Oh.
# Oh, there #
# May be times #
# When you wish you wasn't born #
# And you wake one morning to find your courage gone #
# But just know that feelin' only lasts a little while #
# You just stick with us
We'll show you how to smile #
# Ease on down ease on down the road #

Ah, my ma would be so proud.
Going to see the Wiz!
My mama used to always say to me, Fleet!
Fleet?
That's my name,
Fleetwood Coup de Ville.
- Mama had high ideals.
- Yeah!
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah!
I ain't too happy underground, you all.
- How does he do that?
- It's just a hoax, my friend.
He's got a little motor in his... Pocket.
- Lion! Lion!
- Help!
- Oh, my... Please, somebody!
- Shh!
Lion! Lion!
Owww! Lion!
Li...
Lion!
Aaah!
Lion, save me!
Dorothy!
Toto! Toto, Toto, Toto.
Hey!
Oh! Wait!
- Where's the lion?
- I'm coming!
- Wait, wait!
- Lion!
Come on! Let's go!
- Hurry up!
- This way, this way! Wait for me!
Hey!
Sssss!
# Ease on down ease on down the road #
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
My queen, if you'll allow me, like I say...
...you stick with the big kitty and you'll be in heaven.
Sssss!
Outta the frying pan, into the...
This is like a setup.
Stay away! Dorothy! Lion!
Don't follow them! Don't!
Oh, please! It's a setup!
- Stop!
- Come back!
Jump! Don't go in there!
Whoo, whoo!
Oh! Dorothy! Lion!
- I can't move him! I can't move him!
- Dorothy?
- Get Toto, we'll come back for him.
- Toto!
Oh, look, poor little Toto!
Sweet little Toto.
What are we going to do?
- All is lost!
- Dorothy!
Dorothy, please.
Oh, please, don't be dead.
Oh, please, don't be dead.
Oh, all is lost.
# How high the moon #
What's happenin', babe?
Hey, Lion's okay!
- Hey, baby!
- Come and cry over here!
- Teenie! Think of Teenie!
- Dor... Dorothy?
- Think of Teenie!
- Uh, Teenie, uh, Teenie!
- Uh, Teenie!
- It's all my fault!
Uh, Teenie! Uh, Teenie!
Oh, mighty Zeus!
And gods of the universe!
Why have you cursed this low, mangy animal so?
Once I was a king, a lion amongst lions!
Ruler of a beautiful kingdom by a waterfall.
Attended by butterflies and sparrows.
And now banished for lack of courage...
I cannot even protect these friends who have been so kind.
Oh, I was strong and brave...
...in the subway only to be foolish and weak again.
I led us into the very jaws of death!
Oh, let me end it all!
- Lion, Lion!
- No!
No, let me splatter to the four winds!
It's all right, Lion.
It's all right.
Everything's all right.
- The worst is over, my furry friend.
- No!
Would you lay an appropriate quote on this poor beasty brother?
"Showers expected late tomorrow. "
Lion?
# There is a place #
# We'll go #
# Where there is mostly quiet #
# Flowers and butterflies #
# A rainbow lives beside it #
# And from a velvet sky #
# The summer storm #
# You can feel #
# The coolness in the air #
# But you're still #
# Warm #
# And then a mighty roar #
# Will start the sky #
# To cryin' #
# But not even lightning #
# Will be frightening #
# My lion #
# And with no fear inside #
# No need to run #

- How do we get in?
- And how do you do?
- Good evening there, brother.
- This place is nice.
The service entrance is at the side.
We're here to see the Wiz.
This is where the Wiz lives, isn't it?
May I welcome you to the Emerald City.
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# I want to be seen green #
# Wouldn't be caught dead red #
# 'Cause if you are seen green #
# It means you've got mean bread #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# You've got to be seen in green to show that your stuff's laid #
- # If you're not seen green #
# You'd better be wearin' jade #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# You've got to be seen green #
# Don't tell him your cupboard's bare #
# That you gave up one week's feed #
# To pay for your colored hair #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
# Ahh, ahh, ah #
An announcement from the great and powerful Oz.
Oz.
I thought it over and green is dead.
'Til I change my mind, the color's red.
# I wouldn't be seen green #
# Ooo, ooo, ooo
Ah, ah #
# I wouldn't be caught dead #
# And if I'm caught at all #
# Then catch me in dead red #
# Ooo #
# You've got to be dead red #
# You've got to be real hot #
# So throw away those green gems #
# And wear rubies on your yacht #
# You've got to be dead red #
# You've got to have flash and flair #
# And if you're not seen red #
# Then you shouldn't be seen #
# Nowhere #
How quick fashion goes down the drain.
Last week when you all was wearin' pink...
...already for me, red was old.
The ultimate yellow brick is gold.
That's the new color, children, hit it.
# Golden gold #
# You've got to be seen gold #
# Watch out for the new kind you've got to have old gold #
# Like some from a gold mine
You've got to be wearin' gold #
# The 24 karat kind and once you've shined it up #
# It should ought to make you blind #
# You've got to be seen in gold to show you're super slick #
# It helps to pay tips and tolls
It's the ultimate yellow brick #
# It's the ultimate #
# Gold #
# Gold, gold #
# Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold ##
An announcement from the great and powerful Oz.
Send up the one with the silver slippers.
Do you know how lucky you are?
I've been trying to get an appointment for two years!
No one sees the Wiz!
- I knew you'd make it.
- Who does your hair?
Can you come for dinner next Wednesday?
- Can I give you my card?
- Can I take you home?
And...
Only the one with the silver slippers!
You go ahead, Dorothy.
"He who hesitates... "
Etcetera, etcetera.
Uh, I'd like to speak to the Wiz.
Hey, Mike!
Excuse me...
Excuse me, sir, Mr. Wiz?
Speak!
I'm not alone, sir. I'm here with my three companions and my dog, Toto.
Forget it.
No riffraff.
Uh, they're not riffraff, sir.
They're my friends and they've traveled far to see you.
I said, forget it!
Then, then, I'm not comin' up there.
What?
Either you see my friends, sir, or you forget it.
Send up the riffraff.
I don't think there's any choice.
Dorothy, you don't have to do it!
We could stay right here!
The Emerald City's not a bad place.
Get a small apartment, chip in together.
Hey, I bet in no time we'd fit right in.
But I could never be happy here.
Besides, I'd... Never get home.
I have to go all the way, even if it means to Evillene.
Come on, Toto, good boy.
Then I'm going with you.
Likewise!
Me too.
Come on.
Which road do we take?
Road? This one...
...and you may be sorry.
- Then how do we find Evillene?
- Don't worry.
She'll find you.
Owww!

We haven't had a lunch hour in six months!
Well, suffering is food for the soul.
Now suffer!
So, no one stopped Dorothy, eh?
All right!
Amateur night is over!
I'm summoning my flying monkeys!
No, no, not the flying monkeys!
Yes, yes, the flying monkeys!
I hate to have to do this myself, because I can't stand the smells...
...but these are red alert conditions!
Hot... Fire.
Peee-uu! Aaah!
- What's happenin'?
- Don't come any closer!
I got a little job for you, Cheetah.
Bring me Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Lion and the dog too.
How do you want 'em?
White bread or rye?
You get smart with me and I'll send you back to your cages!
Now get Dorothy and don't damage those silver slippers!
Peee-uu!
War is hell!
Hit it, Morris!
# Don't nobody bring me

I ain't scared.
Aaah!
- Hey, brother!
- Not now!
Lion! Wait for me!
Get back, I told you!
Psst! Psst! Psst!
Psst!
Psst, psst, psst!
We're over here!
- Psst! Lion!
- Psst!
Hey, brother!
You better get outta the way for me!
Toto! Where's Toto?
Toto! Oh!
Toto!
- Toto! Toto!
- Hey, there he is.
- Toto.
- I think we're safe.
So, you're Dorothy, huh?
You murdered my sister!
A saint she was.
And stole her shoes!
- Give them to me!
- No.
- What?
- No!
All right, you!
Don't worry, Dorothy.
It doesn't hurt.
It's just a little rough on my filing system.
Never fear, my little flower.
I'm just a hollow shell!
Don't give up the shoes!
Would you like sauerkraut or mustard, my dear?
On your hot dog!
Toto! Toto! No! Don't!
No, don't!
Don't you dare! Toto, Toto!
- Will you give me those shoes?
- Yes, yes, yes.
That's what I thought.
Toto.
Psst! Psst!
Hurry up with those shoes!
No! Don't touch that! No!
- No! No!
- Toto!
I'm allergic to water!
It makes me melt! No! No!
Please, please, help me with my friends!
Oh, no!
Here it is, I got 'em!
Oh, put him together.
I don't care what you do.
Just put him down.
Put him together.
Where's his arm?
His arm, oh!
Okay, okay, do something!
Get some tools, get something!
A crowbar, a hammer!
Don't hurt him!

Whee!
Hello?
- Where are we?
- This must be the back door.
I don't think the killers of the Wicked Witch of the West...
...should be using the back door.
You know what I mean?
Cheetah says it's a shortcut.
- Good-bye, Cheetah.
- Good-bye, Dorothy.
Bye. Whew!
It's open.
Hello? Hello in there!
Wait!
- Wait a minute.
- Does this look familiar?
Guess who got had?
Barnum said there's a sucker born every minute.
I was there when he said it...
...but I never thought
I'd be one of 'em.
Phony!
You're nothing but a phony!
The Wizard's out!
He's not here!
Lies! No more lies.
You charlatan!
I've seen men shot for less.
- You're a terrible man!
- I'm sorry!
- Sorry?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Phony!
Everything they say about me is true.
I'm a phony!
I got no right to be pretending to be the Wiz!
I've got nothin'.
Hocus-pocus.
I'm just plain old Herman Smith from Atlantic City.
Atlantic City?
Atlantic City?
You mean, you're from New Jersey?
Mm-hmm.
I'm just a second-rate politician from District Seven.
"Public office is the last refuge of the incompetent. " Penrose!
Incompetent?
Ha-ha-ha!
That's me.
I'm incompetent.
So much so, I could never get elected to public office.
Not because I didn't try.
I tried everything.
Look, look!
I ran for everything.
Alderman, councilman, assembly leader!
I became a laughingstock.
I couldn't even get on the ticket!
Finally, in desperation,
I ran for dogcatcher!
I like animals.
Don't get me wrong.
I was at the end of my rope.
I plunged myself into the campaign.
One desperate grandstand play.
You know what I did?
I rented a hot-air balloon!
Hot air!
That's a perfect vehicle for you.
No, no, no!
It was a beautiful
Fourth of July day!
I planned to fly over the boardwalk and the beach...
...and throw my...
Aaah!
Throw my leaflets to the astonished crowds below.
My motto was...
"Vote for Smith, your best bet to catch that pet. "
But just when I got up in the balloon...
A terrible storm came up...
...and blew me into the clouds.
I got lost.
I landed here in Oz.
They'd never seen a hot-air balloon like mine before.
And I know I should have told them the truth...
...but they proclaimed me the Wizard...
...and I needed the job.
And you mean...
...you sent us to kill Evillene...
...knowing... we might never come back?
She would've killed me.
She would've found out
I had no power, and took over Oz.
That's no excuse.
Come on.
Please, please don't go.
I live...
I live here all alone...
...in terror...
...that someone will find out...
...that I'm a fraud.
Please...
...just stay with me for a little while and talk.
You can talk to me crazy...
...call me names.
What's the matter?
Now I'll never get my brain.
Nor my heart.
Or my courage.
But you don't need them now...
...because you've had them all along.
Scarecrow. Scarecrow?
You're the one who figured out how to find the Yellow Brick Road...
...and how to destroy Evillene...
...and every smart move we've made.
Didn't you?
And, Lion...
...you wouldn't even give up when
Evillene strung you up by your tail.
And, Tin Man...
...you have more heart than anyone I've ever known.
Honest?
Yes.
You never needed anything from the fake Wizard anyway.

What about you, Dorothy?
You'll never get home.
Me?
I guess you're stuck with Toto and me.
It's Glinda, the Good Witch of the South!
She has great powers.
Hello, Dorothy.
Please, is there a way for me to get home?
Dorothy, you were wise and good enough...
...to help your friends find what was inside them all the time.
That's true for you, also.
Home?
Inside me?
I don't understand.
Home is a place we all must find, child.
It's not just a place where you eat or sleep.
Home is knowing.
Knowing your mind, knowing your heart...
...knowing your courage.
If we know ourselves, we're always home, anywhere.

Uh-huh.
Dorothy.
Can you do something for me?
They've had what they've been searching for in them all along.
I don't know what's in you.
You'll have to find that out for yourself.
But I do know one thing.
You'll never find it in the safety of this room.
I tried that all my life.
It doesn't work.
There's a whole world out there.
And you'll have to begin...
...by letting people see who you really are.
Success...
...fame and fortune...
...they're all illusions.
All there is that is real...
...is the friendship...
...that two can share.
That's beautiful.
Who said that?
I did.
Oh, Dorothy.
I'll think of you all the time.
And I will miss you...
...every day.
Even if I had to go back to that junk pile...
...even as Teenie's seat cushion,
I wouldn't mind...
...because I have known real love.
Oh, don't rust yourself, now.
Oh, Dorothy.
If it hadn't been for you...
I'd still be back on that pedestal...
...afraid to live.
Me, too.
Thank you.
Thank you for being my friends.
I'm ready now.
Think of home.
Home.
# When I think of home #
# I think of a place #
# Where there's love overflowin' #
# I wish I was home #
# I wish I was back there #
# With the things
I've been knowin' #
# Wind that makes the tall trees #
# Bend into leaning #
# Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning #
# Sprinkling the scene #
# Makes it all clean #
# Maybe there's a chance for me to go back #
# Now that I have some direction #
# It would sure be nice to be back home #
# Where there's love and affection #
# And just maybe I can convince time to slow up #
# Givin' me enough time in my life to grow up #
# Time, be my friend #
# Let me start again #
# Suddenly my world's gone and changed its face #
# But I still know where I'm goin' #
# I have had my mind spun around in space #
# And yet I've watched it growin' #
# And if you're listenin', God #
# Please don't make it hard #
# To know if we should believe the things that we see #
# Tell us should we run away #
# Should we try and stay #

In the year 50 B. C. all Gaul, now known as
France, was covered with impenetrable forest... where calm peace and quite reigned supreme, only the birds...
Hey wait a moment! Wait a moment! I said the year 50 B. C!
In the year 50 B. C. all Gaul was covered with impenetrable forests, where calm peace and quite reigned supreme.
Julius Caesar after much fierce fighting had succeeded in conquering Gaul... intending to set the seal of Romans civilisation on his latest conquest.
Yes, all Gaul, now known as
France, was occupied by the Romans.
Well no not quiet, somewhere in
Armorica, a little village was... holding out against the invaders. A little village surrounded by Romans.
The brave people of this village.
Do I really need to introduce them?
Hands up in the house who hasn't met them yet.
Ah, I see all right! I'll make the introductions.
This big hut is the home of the undisputed chief of the village.
The formidable Vitalstatistix.
Darling, please darling, it's me ought to be up on that shield!
I'm the chief after all!
I've got to go out shopping, you can have your shield back later, meanwhile... you tidy the place up a bit, it's like a wild boars sty! Come on you two!
This is Cacofonix, the village bard, people don't always appreciate... his talents, sometimes express their feelings in a tactful delicate way.
Ah here comes Dogmatix, the village mascot and a great friend of Obelix.
He help him delivering menhirs.
Dogmatix, come here Dogmatix, I'm teaching him to retrieve menhirs Asterix... he could be a big help in my work.
You know Obelix it isn't that I don't think that dog's very intelligent... but I do sometimes wonder if he isn't a rather small to carry menhirs.
The voice of reason you have just heard belongs to the renowned Asterix!
The best warrior in the village! The famous Asterix whose adventures are... on sale in all the best bookshops and had been translated into every language.
Salute! Guten tag! Hello! Hi!
Konnichiwa! Buenas dia! Salam!
Bonjour!
But you may ask yourself how did this little village with its handful... of warriors manage to hold out against the all powerful Roman invaders?
Well that was thanks to the magic potion brewed up by the Druid Getafix... which gave superhuman strength to those who were lucky enough to get it.
Oh no Obelix! No! The potion has had a permanent effect on you!
You know you fell into the
Cauldron when you were a baby.
...fell into the Cauldron when you were a baby...nhanhanhay...
Oh some Romans!
Centurion, what is the point of having another go, you know what those...
Gauls will do to us. That lot is simply not human.
Maybe but those are Caesar's orders, who knows perhaps it will be... different this time. Watch there!
Form square!
Forward!
Join the army they said, it's a real man's life they said.
It didn't turn out so very different form usual did it Centurion?
No, no not very. -I know rather a good joke... post equitem sedet atra cura.
Right these Gauls will make
Latin a dead language... if Julius Caesar would insist on fighting them.
Those Gauls are simply not human
Centurion, they just are not human.
You're right, they not human, ordinary mortals could not resist... the might of the Roman army.
- I told you so.
Must be Gods, we haven't a hope to beat the Gods!
I'm going to Rome to tell
Caesar, the Gods are against us!
They're Gods, you say? This crazy
Gaulish village are Gods, that's a laugh!
But Caesar you do have to admit these Gaulish villages can keep... your army at bay. In my opinion it is time we come to adopt a... realistic approach to the situation.
Gods are against us, we're done for.
While seeking to follow a constructive line, I hope none the less to be quite... objective and I have therefore come to the following conclusion... it is no good trying to fight Gods.
Let us suppose to look on the bright side, we've only got to deal with... demi gods. Well even so, it is still an extremely unpleasant predicament.
To take an example that can be anyone willing to take on Hercules?
Hercules? Gods or Demigods! I
Caesar will show you cowardly... old counsellors that half-wits are only mortal, very mortal. Bruto!
Stop playing about that knife, you'll end up hurting somebody.
But how are you going to show us that those
Gauls aren't Gods after all, oh Caesar?
Well first I shall visit them myself and I shall put them to certain tests... which only the Gods could perform.
And if they really are
Gods then I should give in.
But if they are just men, ordinary human being, they'll have to face the anger of Caesar!
And by Jupiter I can tell you they'll finish up inside the lions of the circus!
Get that chariot and let us got ready!
I think I heard a bell going darling, will you go and see who is there?
Julius Caesar is outside and wants to see you.
Julius Caesar, the
Julius Caesar? Himself.
Right, a towel for my feet, fetch my shoes. Let everyone know Asterix!
Where are those shoe pairs gone to?
Yes I'm coming!
Leave them to me, leave them to me.
- Calm down, let the chief have a word.
Ave, village chief!
- Hail Caesar, what are you doing here?
I have come to make a suggestion.
Your defiance of me is bad for my reputation!
In Rome they're starting to laugh at me.
They are saying a bunch of half wits... can hold the Roman army at bay.
- Really, watch your language you...
But some people say you must be Gods.
Gods?
- Us Gods?
Yes Gods and if that is so then I will admit defeat.
But if you are only men... then you will have to give in into my power and accept our laws.
And how are me and my friends supposed to prove if we are really Gods?
I wonder if you have heard of Hercules?
- Hercules the grocer?
No, no, the God Hercules! He performed
12 difficult task with goddessment meet it to olimpus
It's seen the god saw that he must be one of them
These 12 tasks what were they?
He strangled the Nemean Lion, killed the
Lernian Hydra. Caught the Elymanthian... boar alive. Hunted down the stag
Cerynean, shot the Stymphalian... birds with his bow. Tamed the bull on the Island of Crete, Killed Diomedes... conquered the Amazons, cleaned the
Augean stables in a day, killed Geryon... stole the golden apples of the
Hesperides set Theseus free from Haydees.
And you want us to do all these daft things to show weather or not we're God?
No not exactly that's all a bit out of date now, I set up a new set of tasks.
Only Gods could hope to perform all of them and if you succeed I blow... myself fairly deep but if you fail in even one then you will have to give in. It's a Deal?
You bet your life it's a deal.
- Yes yes!
Right, These tasks will take you to Rome, Caius Pocus!
He will act as your guide along the way and see that the tasks are fairly... performed. He's the most trustworthy man and very honest.
So, if you should succeed, Rome will surrender, if you fail in a single task... then you will all become slaves of Rome.
Okay we'll have it done.
- Ave!
You really think Caesar would surrender and let you become masters of Rome?
Come to think of it perhaps we got a bit carried away.
Oh, your magic potion will help us out Druid.
Sure we'll have lots of fun by Tutatis!
Lots of fun!
- Asterix is the cleverest man among us.
Obelix is the strongest, so you two are the only ones who can succeed.
May Tutatis hear you.
Here is a gourd full of magic potion, mind you use it well.
You're going to need it!
Well then, are we on?
- We're off.
It's funny I wonder why Cacofonix hasn't shown up to sing us a farewell song.
Hi, now for the first task, follow me, will you please?
This is Aspestos just back from Marathon, he was champion runner at the Olympic Games...
He can run faster than a horse, faster than the stone wind that howls through the trees.
One of you will have to beat him in a race.
You'll do it Asterix!
You're faster than me, faster than a horse wind howling through the trees.
All right. We'll be waiting for you on the other side of the forest.
At the finishing line. Start when all the sand has run out of the hour glass.
Well fancy that, you are a real Olympic champion, that's very interesting.
We have athletics in the village too, but obviously as we all get some... of the magic potion it is not very exciting.
Are you listening to me? Right I was saying it's not very interesting because... we all get there at once and we have to draw lots with the winner.
You notice that I don't need to drink any magic potion because I'm very fast.
I say, you are not very chatty are you?
Hey wait for me!
I think I'd better take a little potion the village's future is at stake.
Hey there, not a bad start, you really took me by surprise!
I got a held up back there in the forest because I stopped to pick mushrooms.
You see? I like picking flowers too.
Look aren't they beautiful?
If you like apples I know a good place over there where there is a good tree.
Funny, the race has improved his profile.
That seems to be the first of your tasks performed quite successfully.
So now for the next one.
Kermes the Persian, the most amazing javelin thrower the world has ever seen.
His javelin has crossed oceans and seas, this is your second task.
Throw javelin further than Kermes.
War! This means war!
Now this time Asterix, let me!
All right! But throw it as far as you can.
Just you watch!
Second task performed, and now for the next one.
You are going to play
Silindric the German.
No wrestler or gladiator has ever beaten him.
Silindric the German'll come in that way, you must wait for him here.
Look at the size of those gates, he must be big Silindric the German.
Yes I like them big and strong.
That's him! Silindric the German?
- Why he isn't big at all!
I like them big, hey suppose we give him some magic potion?
Good day, which of you two gentleman is first or both of you at once maybe ja?
I'll go first and finish him off at once and then we go on to the next task.
All right but watch out, there must be a catch; he's got some funny clothes on.
No the robes don't make the druid!
Oh the fat gentleman first. ja
- I am not fat!
Yeah very well the fat one first.
- Listen you!
I say what a splendid way to fight;
I've never seen anything like it.
Ah ja I have learned it on my travels, long long travels far away.
You would like to have a go ja?
- Ja, yes sorry.
It's easy you have only to use the man's own strength to get them down.
The stronger he is the better for you.
Easy, easy you just say that because you're strong.
Nein, nein, word of honour, try yourself, here take my hand.
Put your foot right on the stomach, then raise backward, bend down.
Ja ja, harder harder!
Like this?
- Ja ja, you get the idea, ja ja.
Ja well done! Harder!
That's it!
- Was it really good?
Very good but a little bit soft ja. Lets do the next thing.
When you have got me on the ground, you take the advantage that I'm a little... dizzy and you jump on me, ja.
Like that?
- Gut! You take hold of my arm like this.
And then you pull, you tie a knot, gut! And then the other arm.
Excellent! And what will you think of next? The legs!
Right leg, wunderbar, left leg. Fantastic!
And now you can see I can't move at all, why you have beaten me, mein her!
They have got through the first two tasks all right, not bad but it proves nothing.
Rome is not Gaulish yet.
They've not had much to prove so far, now however the next task!
They will have to face the princesses of the Isle of Pleasure.
I never knew there was a lake here.
Well there is and you have to get across it that's your next task.
I shall go and wait on the other side.
Of course it's inconceivable you... should succeed, there is a boat over there, bon voyage.
I call this test a piece of cake.
We'll reach the other side in no time.
We'd better be careful though, you never can tell.
The lake is calm and the boat doesn't seem to leak.
Oh they sing better than Cacofonix.
Welcome to the isle of pleasure, we were expecting you, this way.
Nice little place you've got but who are you?
Never mind who we are, bold one give yourself up to pleasure.
This way we're going to show you all over our island.
And now you've seen our island, the island you will never leave again.
Your lightest wish will be our command. forever and ever.
What would you like oh warrior?
Some food.
- Some food?
Why not, I'm starved, dancing out in the open makes me hungry.
You're here on the isle of pleasure and the chief priestess herself has asked... what you would like and you ask for food?
Of course eating is a great pleasure.
This is the island pleasure isn't it?
All right we can provide nectar and Ambrosia.
Nectar, no fear, no fear, no none of that boring old stuff!
I want a nice wild boar, wild boar is very tasty.
You call nectar and Ambrosia boring?
Why that is food for the Gods themselves.
Well...Are you Gods or aren't you?
Well I suppose we may be
Gods but we eat wild boar.
But there aren't any wild boar on this island.
What! There aren't any boar
And you expect me to stay with you for good? You must be off your head!
Get lost fatty, do you really think I would lower myself to do your cooking?
And the washing up too.
- And housework!
And clean you shoes!
- Push off, get out!
You bet your life I'll get out, they have no wild boar and they dare to call... this the isle of pleasure! Come on
Asterix, there's nothing here for us.
Never mind him, we'll give you pleasure such as the Gods enjoy... on Olympus oh warrior.
Asterix!
The next task will take place in that temple.
What do we have to do in there?
- You will be required to look deep... into the dreaded eyes of the
Iris, the great Egyptian magician.
By Osiris and by Apis, look at me, look into my eye!
You have turned into a cat! By
Osiris and Apis, a cat. That's right!
By Osiris and by Apis there's a dear pussy cat, off you go little pussy cat.
Next please.
By Osiris and by Apis, look into my eyes, you have turned into a bird.
Yes a bird by Osiris and by Apis, a bird!
You saw that?
- Yes he was flying low, we'll have rain.
Next!
What is all this about? Yes I remember now, and which one of you is to... undergo my pleasure treatment? Sorry to rush you, my appointment book is very full.
I'll have a go.
- All right, seat yourself just there.
Ready then? I'll begin.
By Osiris and by Apis look at me! Look!
How do you do all that with your eyes?
Silence, concentrate please! By Osiris and by Apis look at me, look in my eyes!
By Osiris and by Apis you have turned into a... in what?
A wild boar! You Gauls are very fond of wild boar.
Lets start again. By Osiris and by Apis look in my eyes!
You have turned into a wild boar!
- Can you light one of them up at a time?
I'm Concentrating!
Where was I? A wild boar.
You are wild boar! A wild boar. do you hear? A wild boar.
Must be very useful for reading in bed.
Silence. I have to start again.
You are a wild boar, by Apirsi and by Osaris a boar, by the Usaris.
By Opis oh mama! You repeat after me: I am a wild boar,
I am a wild boar.
You are a wild boar; you are a wild boar.
- That's right. I am a wild boar.
I am a wild boar. A wild boar!
Iris made me hungry going on about wild boar.
What's more it's lunchtime.
Well that's lucky because your next task will be to eat every morsel... of a meal prepared for you by Mannechenpix.
The great chef of the Titans.
No mortal man has ever got through one of his enormous meals!
But you will have to eat it all down to the last crumb. Bon apetit.
An interesting kind of task at last, it's my turn now, right?
No doubt about that.
You are expected monsieur, sit down and I'll be bringing the banquet!
What's this?
- Ah this I have invented myself!
These are ruts that grow in the ground, I hope you'll like them.
The Geese! This is good because they are fat!
The nice mutton platter!
Made for the hungry wolf!
The titanic omelette! Eight dozen eggs!
The whole school of fish, that teaches you what is like to eat well!
The ox, look at him he will melt in your mouth!
This cow might not be as tasty but is much more delicate!
The veal, because to separate the family that would not be right.
A whole thing of caviar, large kind and there is more.
Here is a piece of toast to go with it.
The camel, this you will like, and it has a good stuffing too.
And before we start on the next course The elephant with olives!
Did he eat everything?
- Yes he ate everything!
I have nothing left in my kitchen!
Oh God, I will have to shut my shop!
Did anyone see which way the chef went?
He walked out, I just had the starters!
What on earth is all this?
What's up with you my fellow dressing in that awfully silly way?
It's not silly! I've got to get ready to be ruler or Rome, haven't I?
Ruler of Rome, well honestly.
When my lads have won all their tasks we'll be setting off for Rome.
For Rome? Do you really think
Rome will ever be Gaulish?
I think you are counting your wild boar piglets before they are hatched.
You think so?
- Yes, why don't you all go home?!
That's right, run along, leave us alone!
You don't think they will win?
- Caesar is mighty, he has made a pact... with the powers of darkness and only the Gods know what dreadful... dangers Asterix and Obelix may still have to face.
And now you must go inside the cave of the beast.
The cave of the beast? And what is this beast like?
I have no idea, no one has ever come out alive.
Well nice to have known you.
Coming Obelix? - Why not?
The place looks quite interesting.
How many then?
- EH? Two.
Watch out there, get down!
Hey Asterix...
- Yes I know we shall have rain with the birds fly low.
- Not really!
We can kept nice and dry inside this cave.
Fifteen all.
Excuse me please sir, are we right for the beast?
Look you might at least answer when I ask a question.
Beastly aren't they?
If they think they can frighten us, they are wrong, because everyone knows... that we fear only one thing frighten us and that is the sky falling on our heads.
Shhhh! Watch out.
What might that be?
- I have no idea, but I am really... getting rather fed up, we seem to have been in this cave quite some time.
Come to think of it what is the time?
- It's about twelve noon.
Are you hungry again already?
- Why shouldn't I be hungry?
I'm always hungry at twelve noon, I could eat anything at all!
You hear me? Absolutely anything
Shut up! Listen!
The Beast!
I hope you will forgive my curiosity, but the beast, what was it like actually?
Very tasty, waiter I'd like a drink.
We've only got lemonade.
Those people seem very odd by Tutatis!
They've all been to the place that sends you mad.
The place that sends you mad?
Yes and you'll have to go in there as well, that's your next task.
What do we have to do in this place?
- Oh nothing much!
You have to obtain a certain permit which will allow you to the next task.
I see nothing but a simple administrative formality.
Right, a formality, a simple formality you have to ask for permit number 838.
All right. Obelix!
What is it?
- We want a copy of permit number 838.
If you want to register a galley, you have to ask at the harbour masters office.
We don't want to register a galley, we want a copy of permit number 838.
At the port, it's down at the other side of town, it's down by the seaside.
We don't want to go to the port, we want a copy of permit number 838.
Eh?
- Permit number 838!
There's no need to shout, where do you think you are, by Jupiter!
Apply at window number one, left hand corridor, last door on the right, got it?
Last door on the right?
- Last door on the right?
There is no door on the right!
- Oh he must have got it wrong.
Lets try the door opposite.
And who gave you permission to come into my office?
We're looking for window number one.
- Consult the map on the 6'th floor.
Close the door. Impertinent!
Now where were we Miss?
These stairs are pretty steep.
Carry on.
This one?
- No this is the 4'th we want the 6'th.
Ah this is the plan.
- Can't make it out at all.
Window number one is on the ground floor, last corridor on the right.
What is your business?
- We want a copy of permit number 838.
You have been misdirected, you have to apply at window number 2.
Next door to this one?
- No that one is window 8.
You'd better ask at the front desk.
Where is window number 2?
- I've already told where the port is!
I don't want the port, I've told you!
- Now gentlemen calm down.
Someone is trying to work, and what is the problem may I ask?
I have no idea Mr. Prefect, they keep jabbering a lot of nonsense.
We are looking for window 2.
Window 2, where exactly did they put that one?
Last time anyone saw it, it was on the
3'ed floor, corridor B door 6. Mr Prefect!
There you are gentleman, there was nothing to be getting so worked up about.
We seem to be getting somewhere now.
- Mmmm, I'm not all that confident.
She bought some material from a
Phoenician trader for her cubiculum.
But how strange, how odd!
- She's the kind whose always got to... show off, she can't even afford a slave!
- Miss...
She says she preferred to do her house work herself!
I know her husband's financial situation.
- Excuse me...
Oh can't you see I'm busy, where was I?
- The financial situation.
Oh poor Claudius, you know he worked up a nice little business building viaducts.
Excuse me Miss!
- Would you mind?
Permit number 838!
- Have you filled in a blue form?
A blue form? No! -How do you think to get permit 838?
Where can I get hold of a blue form?
- Window one.
I've been there!
- That's right, that viaduct at the... first gust of wind crashed.
- Did it collapse?
Nothing left but some ruins. Still they look picturesque in the country.
She's at lunch but you could apply at window 35, ask downstairs.
Can't you get it right?
Fill in this form then you'll be able to get the pink form.
What pink form?
- The one you need in order to get... permit 838, window 12, second floor staircase B, corridor J.
You need the yellow form, window 7 on 5'th floor, staircase K corridor W.
Get the green window 14 on the first floor, staircase F, corridor T.
Get the blue form, window 36,
6th floor, staircase B corridor F.
Get the yellow form, window corridor staircase five...
Stop it!
Calm down Obelix, Clam down!
We will never get out of here Asterix, the magic potion won't be any help to us.
We will go mad and we'll be Julius Caesar's slaves.
Not if I know it, it's true the magic potion won't help us but I know what.
I can fight them with their own weapons, you watch this.
Is this where I get permit 839?
Don't you mean permit 838? For 838 you
- No no what I need is permit 839.
In the new circular B65? Wait here. Ever heard of circular B65?
Circular B65?
- The one about permit 839
Not me, we shall have to find out from the head of filing systems of... material not get coordinated.
- It's on the 5'th floor, staircase Z.
The office has moved to the second floor staircase H corridor N, shall we go?
Yes come on.
Circular B65, about permit 839? No.
The messenger of new circular or provisional material must have... forgotten to let us know. They are on ground floor, staircase 2 corridor U.
What a new circular? Go to supervisor of planning and new material.
Where is he? Lets go and ask down at the desk.
Calm down, quiet, quiet!
- Please sir...
I'm very busy just now, what are you after?
Permit number 838!
All right, and kindly leave some people here are trying to work.!
Ave Caesar, morituri te salutant.
Yes Caesar, they have performed them all, even that last task.
Hercules himself would have failed that.
Well, I must admit they are remarkable but they haven't yet got to Rome.
I have 7 special treats in stall for them, there is no need to worry, By Mercury!
We shan't be seeing a little Gaulish village becoming the capital... of the Roman world! We can proceed with the rehearsal now.
Well oh Caesar I guess the rehearsal is just about over.
Let's see what's next on the list,
You'll have to cross this canyon.
Walk across that invisible thread that you do not see there.
Walk along an invisible thread?
Why don't we cross down below it's just a small river and the water looks calm.
Yes but in fact that little river is full of crocodiles.
Lots of sacred crocodiles, they were a present given to Caesar... by the Egyptian head of state, Queen Cleopatra.
They are very savage creatures and very voracious.
Yes I don't like crocodiles, I tried them once, They were stringy.
Come on Asterix!
Oh all right, I suppose we should have to. Are you coming?
You start, I'll follow
Here we go!
Your next tasks is to make the ascent of this mountain.
A the top you must look for the old man of the mountains.
And what do we have to do with this old man of the mountains?
The old man of the mountains will ask a difficult riddle.
You will have to answer it correctly if you get it wrong the results... will be quite fatal, I mean as far as you are concerned of course.
Why can't this old man come down here to ask his riddle?
Come on don't be a lazy bones! Here we go!
There must be a marvellous view from up here.
Here I've run out of mountain side.
That's because you've got to the top, the old man can't be far away.
Would you be the old man of the mountain, old man?
I am the old man of the mountain, have you miserable mortals... come to ask for the riddle?
Well I'm glad we haven't been climbing the wrong mountain.
Come on ask your riddle old man of the mountains, it's not very warm up here.
One moment, do you know foolish men that if you fail to give me... the right answer, you will be banished into the eternal depths of hell?
After climbing all this way, not likely, I've got better things to do.
Come on, the riddle.
So be it oh mortals, follow me. Ow my back!
You ought to take a trip to the seaside, it'll do you good.
Oh you presumptuous mortals, one of you, eyes blind folded by me... but there is still time to go back.
Oh go on, ask your riddle.
One of you will have to tell me which of these two piles of laundry... has been washed with
Olympus, the Gods detergent.
This one, it's silkier, got that.
Yes, you've got it right! Sure enough this pile is much softer, much gentler.
Much whiter, the gods do their washing with Olympus which washes whiter... and leaves your hands much softer.
Holy Gods did you hear that? This mortal has given the right answer.
Holy Gods did you hear that.?
All right we can all hear you.
- Those Gauls lads are pretty good.
You must admit Olympus really does wash whiter and leaves your hands soft.
Ok we get the idea!
- You military men.
Silence, by me!
- But listen oh Jupiter, do these Gauls... who are doing so well, get a place up here too?
We're rather short of space as it is.
- Quiet! We don't let all and sundry... blight our path and to be honest
I'm getting fed up with them!
Rome's over there, not far away, but before you're allowed inside you have...
Spend the night on this plane? Ah good idea!
I feel a bit tired after those tasks, I need a sleep.
Yes but I must warn you that all those who have dared to spend the night... here before you have died of fear. it is called the plane of departed spirits.
Well good night! If that's the right expression.
What do you suppose happens on this plane?
I don't know and I don't care.
We must be fit and well tomorrow to enter Rome to tackle our last task.
Lets go to sleep now.
There's no need to go further, we'll be all right here.
Are you sure?
- Good night Obelix.
Good night Asterix.
Fall in!
Good some Romans! All those Roman just for me!
Forward march!
Don't make so much noise, you'll wake up Mr. Asterix.
Form a triangle!
A heart!
A diamond A spade!
A cubs
Away!
I'll chop off your head poor mortal, we are departed spirits, were ghosts!
Trapped on this cursed battle field where we were massacred because... of the queen and her men and now at this witching hour we take revenge... by making all those who dare to spend the night here die of fear.
What's going on around here?
What's all this row about?
Please Asterix don't be angry, they're only trying to keep their spirits up because they got parted by some witches and mad men.
No you've gone and got it all wrong,
I'll explain it, we are departed spirits.
I couldn't care less who you are, do you know what the times is?
Yes, no do please listen.
- No you can listen to me!
We've run a big race, we've been throwing the javelin, we've been wrestling... we've been how to face the princesses, magicians,
Big beasts, crocodiles, we need a good nights sleep!
You can keep your spirits up but kindless don't keep us up.
I'm sorry you must excuse him.
- Obelix come here.
Oh do listen we're only ghosts!
Quiet!
Get up you are expected.
But where are we?
You're in Rome outside Julius Caesar's palace, Caesar is expecting you.
There is something funny going on here.
The Romans have learnt to build very fast.
What does it matter? Come on then soldier take us to your leader.
Well here you are in Rome at last.
- Yes here we are Julius.
Caius has told me all about you journey.
Yes oh Caesar, they have managed to perform all talks. overcome all problems and succeeded every time.
The Gods have kept you alive, this is where your luck runs out.
It is impossible for you to become masters of Rome!
The last task will be the toughest!
Where you will be massacred.
Aa well as the other
Gauls from your village.
Here we are everyone.
Ah so this is Rome. frankly I'm disappointed.
I think the time has come to play you a little music.
Geriatrics!
Caesar, the Gauls request an audience.
It's the lads.
Here they are
- Look they've all come, Dogmatix.
Say you Gauls! Quiet!
Do you know where you are?
Silence! Silence I say! Silence!
You are all to be slaughtered for the amusement of my people!
And then nothing at all, nothing will cast a shadow on my triumph. Guards!
Well then, well then, which one is it?
That ones for the gladiators, that ones... for the ones with nets, that ones for
Fulvia, I wonder what's she's doing... in there, this one for the lions.
- I'll be happy to lend you a hand.
Caesar's just arrived!
- What a great big crowd!
Roll up everyone, it's ready!
It's the magic potion and I can't have any.
Will the owner of the cart parked in front of thermae, remove it?
Quickly cause is causing obstruction!
I hope everything is ready.
- Yes, Caesar, just to start, these... unhappy Gauls will have to face the fiercest of our Gladiators and if there're... any survivors, we will have to let out the wild beasts, we have lions, tigers... panthers and bears and elephants the audience will love this programme!
All right, you can bring out the gladiators.
Ave Caesar, morituri te salutant.
I think we should all get ready, it will soon be our turn.
Good I'm going in first and you all follow me and keep in line please.
We've got lots of people watching us so lets show some dignity.
And why should you go first?
- I'm your chief, that's why!
But we've been doing all the work haven't we Asterix?
So it's our turn to have some fun now.
- Some people get all the luck.
Who asked you?
- You stupid!
Who said stupid?
- Everyone stand back!
See my foot here?
We've been working hard and the stupid
- Stupid yourself fatty!
Oh Asterix he called me fatty!
You can let the Gauls out now.
Leave them to me! Leave them to me!
- No we won't! No we won't!
I'll smack your face!
- You Just try it!
I will!
- Go one, you just try!
Oh run away!
Let me have one! let me have one!
Oh hello!
- Hello!
I've won one!
- You won what?
Up here! Up here!
Pass him! Pass him to me!
Ow, I've injured myself!
Jolly good, jolly good, that's right!
- Oh yes? Take this!
Pass it on!
Aw who threw that pie at me? Who threw that pie?
Come on! Who did it?
Wild beasts, bring on the wild beasts!
Oh they are making the children laugh!
They ruined the circus!
Stop that! Will you stop!
You Gauls, You performed all 12 tasks
I set you, you've succeeded in every... one of the difficult tasks which I made up for you so you must be Gods.
It's no good trying to fight against
Gods, You are our new masters!
I leave my fate and that of
Rome entirely in your hands.
With great magnanimity the Gauls allowed Julius Caesar to retire to a... little country villa to live there in peace and quiet far from the... responsibility of the past.
Julius your dinner is ready!
What a really wonderful cook you are Cleopatra dear!
As for our friend Caius he was allowed to choose his won reward... for his good and faithful service.
And at last, back in Gaul, in the little village which is now the centre... of the known world, our friends reunited celebrated their return with a... banquet under the stars.
Have we really become the masters of Rome?
Lets face it this is only a cartoon film, and anything goes!
Anything goes!

Right. Space travel isn't what it used to be.
It certainly isn't.
It took us days to get to the Moon.
Now if you blink, you miss it.
I've punched in our destination and it's been relayed to the computer at the stargate.
Entering stargate.
That wasn't so bad.
Don't make me open my mouth just yet.
Your system will get used to space warp travel soon.
In most cases.
Terrific.
I'm picking up
Directorate Starfighters dead ahead.
- One of them is in combat.
- It's a dogfight, all right.
Anything on the distress channel?
Scout 3 to Leader,
I'm under attack by pirates.
Request assistance. Help me, please.
Should have kept your butt up with us, 3.
Take evasive action while we circle back for you.
It might be too late then.
- Shall we?
- After you.
Hang on.
- Nice shot, Colonel.
- Nice flying, Captain.
- 3, you're in the clear.
- 'Thank you.'
Leader to Scout 3, indicate damage sustained.
Scout 3, how badly are you hurt?
Leader, this is Earth Recon 1. It appears he's sustained a hit on his starboard side.
I'm all right, sir. Damage is minimal.
- You don't sound all right.
- 'Follow us in, 3, and keep up this time.'
Recon 1, I appreciate your concern but I'd appreciate it more if you refrained from interfering in a Directorate training mission.
What? If that's interfering, there's something wrong with your Funk & Wagnalls.
I don't know what that means, but how'd you like to repeat that in the hangar?
I'd love to.
What happened to you out there?
Sorry, Major Danton.
I couldn't concentrate. I couldn't keep up.
- Are you all right?
- Of course not.
I'm afraid I don't feel well, sir.
You two, come on. Hurry up.
Take this man to the Directorate clinic.
Have someone there call me. Half my men are sick and I want to know why.
Maybe it's a reflection on your training techniques.
You're the one who was showing off up there.
- I was responding to a distress signal.
- From someone in my command.
- That didn't matter to the pirates.
- My cadets are my responsibility.
They're mine too, Major.
Oh, hello, Wilma.
- Colonel Deering.
- I was also on Recon 1 and in my judgment your cadet was in grave danger.
I gave the OK to interfere.
I see.
Excuse me. Major Duke Danton,
Captain Buck Rogers.
So you're Buck Rogers?
Since the day I was born.
I beg your pardon, Colonel, but he's no captain.
That's not true. While Buck has declined to join the Defense Directorate, he does help us out.
Declined to join?
Now, why would a big, brave hotshot like yourself do that?
I didn't think I'd like the company.
Speaking of fancy flying,
I was hoping Buck would head up a combat technique session.
I think our pilots would benefit from a lecture in 20th-century battle strategy.
Wilma, that's ridiculous.
You will introduce your class to Captain Rogers immediately.
That is an order.
I'd like to check on that cadet.
What was his name?
Saroyan. Regis Saroyan.
If you'll excuse me.
Wilma, don't forget drinks.
1900 hours, my place.
You know something, Buck Rogers?
I'll be there.
She's some kind of woman, isn't she?
Help... Help me.
I can't concentrate.
I don't know what's wrong.
I can't keep up.
Somebody... Pirates.
Please, somebody.
His father is Tabor Saroyan, the governor of Vistula.
I suppose I should notify him personally.
Just how serious is his condition?
It's his nerves, controlling his voluntary muscles and motor coordination.
They're deteriorating, like the others.
- Others?
- Yes.
The Computer Council has ordered that a statement not be made yet.
So far, here in New Chicago,
25,000 cases have been reported.
- When did all this start?
- Three days ago.
And this disease has cropped up in other cities on Earth, but in New Chicago it's much, much worse.
I can't concentrate.
What the Computer Council is trying to keep secret is its effect on our defence squadrons.
They've been hardest hit of all.
- You think it's happening purposely?
- Let's go meet a man who could tell us.
I don't know what's wrong.
How is this possible?
'Your question, I presume, is rhetorical and therefore a waste of my time.'
You don't know the answer either!
How you hate to admit knowing no more than I do.
- 'I do not.'
- Yes, you do.
Huer, I was just about to contact you.
Colonel Deering, Dr Mallory.
- Colonel.
- And his assistant, Stella Warden.
And, of course, Carl.
'I find you also somewhat less than memorable, Dr Huer.'
Dr Huer, you asked Carl and me to accomplish two things.
One, find an antidote.
- You've developed one?
- Not yet. We shall.
You also asked us to find the source of the biochemical agent that's poisoning Earth's citizens.
That source is right there.
- A food disc?
- Consumed by millions of people daily.
How can a contaminant get into our food?
All processing is monitored by the Food Directorate.
I can't answer that yet.
But Carl and I have developed a substance that will detect the poison.
At least we can stop any more contaminated food discs getting out.
What about the pilots that have already been poisoned?
They seem to have a modicum of health but are not at full functioning ability.
- You mean they can't fly?
- I'm afraid not.
But a light in the tunnel, Colonel.
Carl here may creak and squeak and slip a microdisk every now and then, but I'm sure he'll come up with an antidote that'll put our pilots back in their starfighters.
In my day we used the strategy of a popular sport called football...
Football?
...to explain combat strategy.
A very amusing term, Rogers.
We actually have to put a ball on our foot?
In combat, you wanna split their offensive line and get to the brains of the operation.
Are we talking brain surgery or combat?
In football, the quarterback is the brains of the operation.
If you get him while he's still carrying the ball, your strategy works.
- One way of doing this is by red-dogging.
- (Laughter)
Red-dogging!
When you're up against superior numbers, you want to sack the quarterback.
You do this by red-dogging your linebacker.
What this means is punching a hole through their offensive line so your top defensive back can go right through and bring the quarterback down.
We never bargained for a lecture on ancient sports.
- It's fascinating.
- (Laughter)
- Buck?
- Yes.
What do you mean by sacking the quarterback?
Yeah, Rogers, what do you mean by sacking?
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah, I really wanna know.
Well, let me see...
Could you step right over here for a second?
That's fine, right there.
When I use the term sack, what I mean is tackle.
And basically a tackle looks something like this.
That's what I mean by sacking the quarterback.
- Now...
- (Girl screams)
How was that?
- Was that any better?
- No.
That's clipping, it's illegal.
Let me show you how you should have done it.
See the difference?
- Yeah, I think I do.
- Good.
But let me try it again.
(Theo) What in the world was that?
(Twiki) Bidibidi. Sounded like Buck.
(Theo) Don't be silly.
That felt a little better to me.
How about you?
Well, some people are just slow learners.
There it is again.
Captain Rogers and Major Danton couldn't be making all that noise.
- Wanna bet?
- Let's look.
Well, I think you've learned enough for one day and I'd like to thank you for... Urgh!
Now I've learned enough.
That's all for today.
Cadets, report to the hangar at 0800.
Bidibidibidi.
Hi, guys.
Two grown men fighting! How disgusting.
No, no. We were just giving a demonstration.
Bidibidibidibidi.
Easy for you to say.
Our temperamental friend is about to begin a nitrogen breakdown of the elements we've isolated so far.
Would you monitor his read-outs till I get back?
Gladly, sir. It's about time you took a break.
A plus-three factor would indicate a possible antidote, but considering the mood he's in...
I understand.
'Nitrogen breakdown commences.
Order of components...
'Stella, what are you doing?
'Stella!
'I'm in danger.
'I'm in danger. Assistance!
'Danger. I am in danger.
'Assistance. Somebody come, please.
'Too late. Goodbye, Mallory.'
- You ready?
- Mm-hm.
Hurggh!
- How's that?
- Fine. Just fine.
- Not too hard?
- No.
Maybe you shouldn't teach me judo till you've recovered from 20th-century battle strategy.
- Why don't we take a break?
- OK.
- Who's this?
- Someone I knew a long, long time ago.
- She's beautiful.
- Yeah.
And you're only seeing the outside.
Excuse me.
It's your dime, shoot.
'I understand
Colonel Deering is there, correct?'
Yes. What's happened?
'Just come down to the hospital research lab.'
It's cold-blooded murder.
I'll never find the antidote now.
Not without Carl.
Not without Carl.
- His assistant was responsible.
- I gather she's disappeared?
They don't want us to find an antidote and they've set us back by days, even weeks.
Which means Earth will remain next to defenceless.
There's still something we can do.
You see...
Buck, I'm sorry. No offence, but this deals directly with the Defense Directorate, and seeing as you hesitate to become a member...
Yeah, sure. You're right.
All the food discs manufactured for Directorate Housing were contaminated.
So someone is trying to incapacitate our squadrons.
And they obscured that fact by allowing the disease to enter other cities.
We also found that all the contaminated food discs have one thing in common.
Vistula.
What's vistula?
If what Wilma tells me is true, we're in trouble.
And Earth in the 25th century is better than no Earth at all.
- So count me in.
- That's fine, Buck.
- So, what is vistula?
- Vistula is an agricultural planet, just beyond Stargate 5 in the Epsilon Ludi system.
It's where much of the vegetable protein in our food is grown and where...
Vistula ll, this is Warden.
Do you read me?
'Vistula ll, this is Warden.
Do you read me?'
- We read you.
- Tell Kaleel I have some good news.
So you must ready yourselves, my friends.
Your moment is at hand.
No longer shall you live in the Sea Of Stone while others reap the benefits of our world's lush glory.
No longer shall you work to feed the people of distant planets while your own sons and daughters go hungry.
Soon you will descend upon the Earth like meteors, like fire, and consume them with the flames of your righteous anger.
The only ones who can stop us are those enemies among us.
Those who are weak and faithless, those who do not believe, those who attack me out of fear and jealousy, these are our enemies.
Every moment you tolerate their presence among us is a moment lost for you and your children and your children's children.
I know of one.
Leila, no.
My husband.
He speaks against you in the dead of night.
Lying beside me, he says you are the one that makes us work for the Governor.
He says you sell us and keep the money.
He's afraid of the future.
Afraid of dying for the cause.
Afraid not for everyone else, but for himself.
Do not harm him.
You have nothing to fear.
My touch is the touch of truth.
The kiss of God.
If your heart is good and true, you shall live.
- If not...
- Please, don't.
Leila, help me!
For God's sake, help me.
No!
(Chanting) Kaleel. Kaleel. Kaleel. Kaleel.
Kaleel. Kaleel. Kaleel. Kaleel.
Kaleel. Kaleel. Kaleel. Kaleel.
No one is to leave.
They'll get another talk in half an hour.
- You've heard from Stella?
- Yes.
She says Earth has little chance of curing their pilots
- until after we've launched our attack.
- Good.
But the Directorate is no different from any other organisation.
As long as its leader exists, it is a threat.
As I'm sure you are well aware.
If you're referring to Dr Huer,
Stella indicated he's about to be taken care of.
Good.
You'd better be quick.
- Who's in charge of Vistula?
- One person, apparently.
He or she is appointed to the position every seven years.
Tabor Saroyan is the current governor, with some interest in saving those pirates this morning.
I don't understand, Dr Huer, why would the Governor contaminate the
Directorate's food when his son is here?
I don't know, Buck.
He might be unaware of what's happened.
We know something is happening.
Let's go to Vistula for a look.
I could call Governor Saroyan and suggest that Regis be returned to Vistula to recuperate there.
And you could send us as an honour guard.
Could you be ready to leave at 0700 tomorrow?
But we'd look more like an honour guard if we sent a few of our best pilots.
I really can't spare them, but you'll have them.
Get down!
- (Whirring)
- Don't raise even a hair.
Good heavens. What was that?
Be careful.
They sure don't make these like they used to.
It's a sick suit. It'll monitor his vital signs and administer treatment.
He'll feel better when he reaches Vistula.
- Morning.
- Morning, Doctor.
Governor Saroyan is expecting you.
We have the samples of the tracing agent.
We're all set.
Not quite yet. Dr Theopolis, do you have those going-away presents?
- Bidibidibidi.
- Theo, you shouldn't have.
(Twiki) Theo didn't, I did.
(Theo) Ignore Twiki, everyone.
He was up all night putting these together and his circuitry is a bit frayed.
Those wristbands will give you a warning if the contamination enters your systems.
You can also monitor each other's telemetry so they can serve as radio directional finders.
- Better than a graduation gift. Thanks.
- Any time, Buck.
Here come the pilots who'll be your escorts.
- Uh-oh!
- Uh-oh?
Oh.
Major Fields, Captain Rogers.
Major.
I understand you two have already bumped into each other.
(Giggling) They certainly have.
The problem is you and Duke are too much alike.
Once you get to know him, he's not that bad.
Come on, give him a chance.
I intend to.
How long have you known him?
Since flight school.
Are you close?
No. Not any more.
Was your moving up in rank part of the problem?
That was the least of it.
- Care to elaborate?
- No.
Some things never change.
'Coming up on Vistula.'
We're cleared for landing.
Very good, Major. We'll follow you in.
There it is.
The entire planet is devoted to growing vegetable protein.
We'll be going to where the food is processed for shipment to Earth.
- What's that barren area?
- It's a huge desert.
Vistula's first inhabitants called it the Sea Of Stone.
Nothing of any consequence can grow there.
Saroyan's son has arrived.
The Governor has prepared a banquet for the copilots who escorted him.
The fool has been so helpful he deserves to have a good time.
Just so he remains totally ignorant of what's happening right under his nose.
He might not.
- Dr Huer survived the attempt on his life.
- What?
He could know the poison food comes from
Vistula and he's sent them here as spies.
Well, if they're staying at the
State House, we needn't worry.
And should they stray too near the fire, we'll simply see that it engulfs them.
- (Chuckling)
- Julio, this is such a festive occasion.
I can't remember enjoying myself so much in years, can you?
No, I can't.
- Does everybody have enough wine?
- Yes.
Regis, are sure you feel well enough to join us? You do look pale.
- I'm fine, Father.
- I am so grateful to you for bringing Regis home.
My physicians tell me he received excellent care on Earth.
But your computers were unable to diagnose his illness.
They think it's a virus. Hopefully,
Dr Huer will be able to tell you more soon.
I'm not letting you leave.
Not until you've had three days of royal treatment!
- And a full tour of our production facilities.
- Of course.
We'd enjoy that.
No, thank you, Ryma. Just water, please.
I'm afraid I couldn't keep anything else down.
It isn't often that I have visitors from my home world.
Except for those boring systems analysts.
And those dreadful investigators that the Food Directorate periodically dispatches to check up on me.
As if, after three successive appointments to this job, I was going to slip up! Ugh!
Come on, now, eat up! Eat up.
It isn't every day that I have a full meal brought in here from... What's it called?
Dionysin.
- None of this food is from here?
- Of course not!
You can imagine how quickly one tires of soy products.
No, I have all my food brought in.
An expense budgeted into the Governor's salary.
Come on, Julio. You speak as if these people were Food Directorate spies.
I'm afraid our friend has been too long in the trenches.
And I'm not crazy about his foreman. If looks could kill, rigor mortis would set in.
Why haven't I seen any mobile service modules anywhere?
Too expensive. And unnecessary.
We have a human workforce at our fingertips.
All your operations are performed by people? I didn't know that was possible.
Not only possible, but extremely practical.
The inhabitants of the Sea Of Stone make excellent workers.
Some of them are a trifle difficult after their purchase...
You buy people and force them to work here against their will?
Oh, but they are uncivilised nomads.
One of their own people, a man called Kaleel, he gathers a group together and sells them to us.
It is a very satisfactory arrangement.
It's slavery.
Slavery?
Even uncivilised nomads have rights...
- I'm sorry!
- No problem.
- What do you think you are doing?
- It's OK.
My apologies.
There is no excuse for such clumsiness.
I expect more from State House servants than from field labourers.
Perhaps the fields are more to your liking?
Governor, it is all right.
No harm has been done.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
You treat them like machines.
They're not. They're humans, they make mistakes.
A very interesting notion.
I believe I've suggested something similar to you in the past.
- (Splashing)
- ♫ Da-dah da-da-dee...
♫ Strangers in the night
♫ Exchanging glances
♫ Wondering in the night
♫ What were the chances
♫ We'd be making love
♫ Before the night was... ♫
- My singing was that bad?
- I have to talk to you.
Someone's outside listening.
The music should cover our conversation.
- I wanted to thank you for what you did.
- No problem.
- You meant what you said about slavery?
- Yes, or I wouldn't have said it.
You said someone was listening.
Who? Saroyan?
No, of course not.
It's my people I'm worried about.
Kaleel's followers.
Governor Saroyan is a fool.
The only one with any sense in that family is his son.
Regis has tried for years to help the nomads.
- You have a thing for him, don't you?
- A thing?
A crush.
You like him.
Let me get of here, I'm starting to wrinkle.
I'll check the door.
I think he's still out there.
It seems that Kaleel is some kind of a slave-trader, not the kind of man who would have followers.
He's more than just a slave-trader.
- He's a sorcerer.
- Come on.
It's true. Kaleel feeds off the adulation of a crowd.
He siphons off their love and energy.
Sorcerer, mutant, call him what you will, but he can mesmerise a group with just his words.
- Why haven't you fallen under his spell?
- Some of us have escaped his will.
My brother was one.
He told me he discovered something terrible about the processing plant.
He was going to meet me to tell more.
He never came.
- Kaleel had him murdered.
- Which plant?
- Can you show me how to get there?
Yes. Then you'll help me get rid of Kaleel?
- I'm certainly gonna try.
- There is one other thing.
I was supposed to be yours for tonight, and if they see you leave without me...
Well, I'll leave by the window.
You stay here.
I've got a reputation to uphold too.
Hello. Official business. Food Directorate.
Excuse me.
The poison's in the packaging.
(Man) Where did he go?
(Woman) All I know is that he wasn't pleased with me.
I see.
And so he left through the window.
All right, Ryma,
I'm asking you for the last time.
What did you tell him?
Some story about your brother?
You murdered my brother.
What more is there?
Did you tell him he worked at the food plant?
Is that where Rogers is?
Don't bother.
We'll take her back to the mountain.
Kaleel will make her talk.
Take her to the shuttle port.
The transport for the mountain leaves at dawn.
Night-time is for sleeping.
Where's the locking mechanism?
- You're Rogers' friend.
- Colonel Deering.
I heard what you said about the processing plant.
- It's part of Kaleel's plan.
- What plan?
You'll find out soon enough.
I'm sure Kaleel will answer any questions you might have.
And you any questions he might have.
Ryma?
Ryma?
Are you all right?
We're on a ship that'll take us to Kaleel's fortress.
There's no escape now.
Because of me you're going to die.
Rogers too.
- Don't count on it.
- Why didn't I just follow like the rest?
Don't give up yet.
What are you doing?
Letting Buck know he has a friend in need.
Buck, did you two have a nice chat?
Keep it down. Come in here.
When did Wilma leave the Governor's do?
About two hours ago, same as everybody else. Why?
She's missing. And the slave girl.
- Something's happened to her?
- I'm afraid so.
- You can tell where she is with that?
- Yeah. About 3 km away.
- Let's go get her.
- Hold on.
It's not safe to try and communicate with Earth and I have to get this to Huer.
Major Fields can do it.
See you in a few minutes.
We're on our way.
I hope Buck can say the same.
What is that glow on the horizon? The sun?
By the time it reaches halfway to its zenith, we'll be inside Kaleel's mountain.
You'd better hurry.
I just ran into one of Julie's guards.
Right, you take off first and tell Huer exactly what I told you.
Don't use your radio till you're well beyond the stargate.
- Will do. Good luck.
- Thank you.
Wilma's moving, but slowly.
Must be on a shuttle.
We're almost there.
The shuttle's about to dock with Ryma and the Earth woman on it.
They're to be brought here.
Another thing,
Julio said two Earth starfighters left the State House 15 minutes ago.
We have one of them on the scope.
The shuttle is being followed?
You're in charge of military operations, Galen.
What do you intend to do?
Employ the power leech.
Excellent.
Whatever Wilma was in, it's stopped now.
Do you have any idea what we're gonna do when we get there?
- No.
- Just thought I'd ask.
What are you doing?
Our engines are shutting down.
Tell me something I don't know.
- PC gauges say we have enough energy.
- But not where we need it.
Somebody's using a power leech on us.
- I don't know if I can keep her up.
- Hit the retro gravity valve.
It cancelled out. Any more ideas?
Not a one.
I don't understand!
Where have all our guests gone?
Colonel Deering, Major Danton, even that boorish Rogers.
- Where have they gone?
- You really don't know what's going on.
I've tried to tell you for years.
About Kaleel?
How he exploits the nomads, makes them hate your name?
I have a job to do.
I always do the best I can.
We've been through this before.
You never listen. Not really.
Julio you listen to.
Julio, whose loyalty is to Kaleel.
But never to me.
You've never listened to your own son, so I gave up trying to make you hear.
Please, Father, for your sake, not mine.
Look around you, see what's going on, what has been going on for years.
The sooner you realise, the less you'll be hurt.
Duke?
Duke!
Keep it down.
- What kind of landing do you call that?
- You still complaining?
No, I guess not.
She was a good ship, though.
All I want is one crack at whoever brought us down. Just one.
Talk about no trespassing signs.
- Still got a fix on Wilma?
- Yeah. She's landed.
About 18 kilometres in that direction.
Well, we better get our survival gear on.
Yeah.
Otherwise we'll look like a couple of brown-and-serve rolls at sunset.
Kaleel has a place where he puts people who are a threat to him.
No one knows what happens there cos no one's ever come back.
It might be different with you, but I doubt if he'll have much to say to me.
- I'll say goodbye now.
- Plenty of time for that.
- Move.
- Is optimism military training?
- No. I picked up a lot outside the military.
- Move!
I said move.
Run, Wilma!
This thing itches like crazy.
Take it off if you don't mind getting sunburn.
- You probably feel at home wearing yours.
- That's right.
I've seen pictures of how people dressed in your time.
Your historians got things so messed up they don't know the difference between a cowboy and a cop.
Careful.
Careful.
The filament you're soldering is the precise thickness as the one you're replacing.
Be very careful, Twiki.
It was very difficult to make.
- Bidibidi. Get off my back.
- I'm not on your back.
And please concentrate on what you're doing.
If anything, I'm on your front and I can't get off without your help.
Where did you find such expressions?
- My good buddy Buck.
- I should have known.
It's hard to believe he learned to speak on the same planet as us.
That's very good, Twiki.
Dr Mallory?
Would you send a light current through Carl's higher-level circuits?
It won't do any good.
They've all been destroyed.
Please, Dr Mallory, the current.
What did I tell you?
Dr Mallory, Major Fields just brought this in from Vistula.
The poison that entered our food supply did so through the packaging.
Ingenious.
Buck hoped that a sample like this might help you come up with an antidote.
It would have.
But without Carl, it does me no good.
No good at all.
'Why, you self-pitying old goat.'
- Carl?
- 'Who else would it be, you ignoramus?
'Nice to see you again, Mallory.'
We'll get started on that antidote now.
Good. The Defense Directorate has so few pilots now that Earth could scarcely ward off pirates, let alone anything organised.
- Keep me informed.
- I shall.
Let's leave Dr Mallory to his work, Twiki.
'I owe you a great deal, Theopolis.'
Bidibidi. Bidibidibidibidibidi.
You mean you owe
Twiki and me a great deal, Carl.
- And it's quite all right.
- Bidibidibidi.
Another one of Buck's colourful phrases?
Why did you kill your brother?
The Governor's foreman says he was found dead after he went to meet you.
What he said, you must not have liked, that's what the workers say.
So that's how you twisted it around, and that's how you'll explain my disappearance.
There's something wrong with you.
Your brother was the same way.
You were always different.
Always complaining, always unhappy.
No one will miss you two terribly.
Go ahead, kill me.
Give me your touch of death but don't ever forget that I knew the truth.
Our enemy isn't Saroyan or Earth, it's you.
You stole our dreams, took away what we might have been.
Maybe you can suck the dreams out of the others, but not me.
You never got to me.
And don't you ever forget that.
You are evil, Ryma.
The evil and the weak must be purged.
Go on! Kill me.
I'd rather be dead than one of your zombies.
No!
You are truly evil.
The kiss of god would only sanctify you, even in death. I won't give you that.
Take her to the furnace.
The woman from Earth's
Defense Directorate hasn't been found.
- Did you double the guards at the exits?
- There's no need.
I've worked with these people and I know how they think.
She won't try to escape, not just yet.
You're not eating?
It's pretty hard to eat something that just crawled on the ground.
I prefer my food pills.
It's up to you. If you wanna risk being poisoned, go ahead.
Remember all the times
I've called you a barbarian?
Well, I don't take any of them back. Not one.
Argh!
Don't do anything yet.
- What do they want?
- Anything they can get.
I bet you wear that mask cos your face looks like it's been through a meteor shower.
Either they agree or they don't understand a word.
How do you wanna handle this?
You take the two on your side and I'll take the two on mine.
- Whatever you say.
- Ready? Let's go!
Argh!
I got him.
Watch it.
Don't forget to write.
Buck, you were terrific.
You weren't half bad yourself.
- Let's get our things and go after Wilma.
- Sure.
Buck, look what happened to your dinner.
It's OK, I was on a diet anyway.
This ought to come in handy.
Instead of running she headed straight for a transmitter to get word to Earth.
What did I tell you?
Predictable to a fault, these Earth people.
One of whom you used to be.
I became one of you so that someday
I could help overcome you.
And that day has arrived, Colonel Deering.
There. Wilma's inside that mountain.
- Do you think Kaleel is in there?
- I don't know.
I got a feeling Wilma's close to the reason
Kaleel's poisoning Earth's food supply.
Buck?
How can we be sure that Wilma is still alive?
Cos I'm still getting a signal on this.
It runs on body heat.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Wait a minute. Do you see something?
- Can you believe that?
- I think we're looking at the second part of Kaleel's plan.
With no air defences, how can Earth stand up to that?
Once Kaleel has weakened enough of our pilots, he intends to launch a massive attack on Earth. It'll be devastating.
The only chance that Earth has is to get up here and launch a secret strike against that airfield.
Those ships have got to be destroyed before they leave.
Problem is, how do we get word to Huer?
Which one of us can get the most out of one of those?
All bragging aside, I could.
I'll transmit ahead.
Once I get through the stargate.
Then I'll have to land, fuel up and get back here with as many pilots as we have left.
Thanks.
But they could use that same thing to knock you down.
No. I'll go right to translight velocity.
They'll never catch me.
Find Wilma.
First thing is to find my way inside that mountain, but I'll find Wilma.
Good luck, Major.
Same to you, Captain.
You said no one ever survived a crash in the desert.
- No one ever has before.
- Then who's stealing one of our ships?
He's gone translight.
I need more time.
He got away.
It simply moves my timetable up.
But Earth will be alerted to our attack.
This is why, isn't it?
It's giving off some kind of a signal.
It hardly matters any more.
By tomorrow she will have met the same fate as Ryma and we shall rule the Earth.
But according to Julio, there were two people in that crash.
That fighter can hold only one, which means someone is still around.
And with this, I have a way of getting him.
Don't I?
I didn't say I need all the pilots you could spare,
I said I need all the pilots.
Major Danton, I just can't do that.
I cannot order that Earth be left defenceless.
I'm telling you that if that fleet lifts off, Earth is done for anyway.
Dr Mallory says he's close to finding an antidote.
If you could just wait one more day.
I could, but the people in that desert won't.
We have to move now with everything we've got.
I'll discuss it with Dr Theopolis.
Just make sure those pilots are waiting for me in the hangar.
'Danton out.'
There's nothing to discuss.
Major Danton is right.
But he's talking about so few pilots.
He has no idea.
However, as you've indicated, we have no choice.
I will scramble what's left of our forces.
Bidibidibidibidi.
Hm? What was that, Twiki?
Nothing, Doctor. Excuse us, won't you?
We'll see you on the flight deck.
- Thank you for your help.
- Certainly.
Twiki, that was the best idea you ever had.
I must be rubbing off on you.
This what you're looking for?
What's wrong? Don't you like surprises?
Not particularly, no.
Major Danton, welcome home.
You should be saying have a nice flight.
I'm leaving when the pilots arrive.
I see.
You look like you have some bad news for me.
I've scrambled all available pilots.
- When are they due to get here?
- They are here.
- This is it?
- I'm afraid so.
Brigadier Gordon here has come out of retirement to help.
- You look familiar.
- You were my instructor in pulsar cannon.
- Yes.
- 15 years ago.
- 15 years ago.
- Good to have you back, sir.
It's good to be back.
Except these pilots, everyone is just too ill to be of any use to you.
Six pilots.
Bidibidi. Seven. Can't you count?
Reporting for duty, Major.
- This is too much.
- As Twiki reminded me,
I am thoroughly familiar with our starfighters.
Don't forget, I helped design them, and difficult as it was for me to do,
I've adjusted my input circuits to respond to you as if you were my... superior.
All right, you can come along.
Hot dog!
We launch in five minutes.
Good luck to all of you.
Sorry, Buck.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
No thanks to our host.
The all-mighty Kaleel, I presume.
- And you are?
- Buck Rogers.
What have you done with the other girl?
She has been put to death.
What will your friend do when he returns to Earth?
Let's see, you've seen the fleet
I've been building up and no doubt concluded that my plan is to weaken Earth by poisoning its members so the planet can be conquered with ease.
Murder seems to be second nature to you.
Why not wipe us all out so you can walk into power?
Mass death would have caused alarm, attracted too much attention.
Dr Huer would have suspected foul play immediately.
This way, the gravity of the situation crept up on him.
By the time he had an inkling of what was truly happening, it was too late.
That's not the reason.
You get your kicks by turning people who should hate you into zombies who follow you.
Stop it!
Let's just get rid of him.
He and Colonel Deering will meet the same fate as Ryma, but first things first.
Now that Earth knows of my plan, what do your people intend to do?
Prepare for your attack.
And with our remaining forces, give you a reception you won't forget.
You are lying!
Your friend will lead your forces back here in hopes of destroying my fleet on the ground.
Pass the word.
We'll prepare to launch our attack today.
If Earth's forces are on the way, they'll be greeted by 100 fighters.
But each one of our pilots is an expert.
Yours are not conditioned to think for themselves, only to follow.
True.
But consider the quality of leadership.
Haven't you recognised this man yet,
Colonel Deering?
He will orchestrate our attack, positioned behind all others, Galen.
Galen?
He'll tell each and every pilot exactly what to do.
Galen. He was the best military strategist Earth had.
Then seven years ago we heard that his talents could be bought.
Then he disappeared.
Quite selfishly, we hoped he was dead.
Instead, I'm here.
About to spearhead an attack that will destroy Earth's remaining forces.
Your friend expects to surprise us.
Just imagine the surprise that's in store for him.
Punch in course seven-X... four-nine-zero.
See you up there.
We're next, Twiki.
Here we go.
Bidibidi. Geronimo!
Kaleel. Kaleel. Kaleel. Kaleel.
Howdy Doody must be taking the stage again.
Ryma!
She's still alive.
For whatever that's worth.
Kaleel. Kaleel. Kaleel. Kaleel.
(Shouting) Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel! Kaleel!
The time is now.
The time has come for you to sail into battle and be victorious.
Earth is about to fall victim to its own greed.
Soon you shall meet those who have exploited you for so long, and you shall defeat them.
No longer shall you live in caverns and canyons.
All Earth's wealth is yours... for the taking.
Having suffered so long at Saroyan's hand, you deserve the Earth.
Listen to Galen.
Do what he says and don't be afraid.
Only the weak are afraid.
And as long as I am with you, as long as the kiss of God is on your heads, you shall prevail.
Kaleel. Kaleel. Kaleel. Kaleel.
Looking good back there.
We hit the stargate in approximately 12 minutes.
7, you're falling out of formation.
The least you could do is keep up.
Understood, Major Danton.
We're adjusting our course accordingly.
We've drifted two degrees starboard.
Pay attention to what you're doing.
- Bidibidi. Roger.
- What about Rogers?
What do you think all these pipes are for?
Water, maybe.
Pumped from underground springs.
Maybe they pass it through here to warm it up.
That's what I was thinking.
And these holes?
Warm air vents.
That means they lead to other rooms.
If these pipes carry water, they must be strong and one of these holes could carry us out of here.
How are you gonna get up there? Fly?
- That's not a bad idea.
- What is that?
A 25th-century cherry bomb.
All I need is something to put it under.
What are you gonna do with it?
Preferably put it under a tin bucket.
- Keep your face turned away.
- You gotta be kidding.
You're not kidding.
I hope this timer works.
Uhhh...
Phew!
Don't go away. I'll be right back.
He knows what he's doing.
He'll be back.
Come on, don't leave me now. Stay with me.
Just in time, Julio.
And how is the good Governor?
Just as ignorant, and terribly upset.
It seems that his guests left last night without saying a word.
I expect you to keep us informed, Galen.
And entertained.
That I shall.
You can track us on the screen as far as the stargate.
Beyond that, we'll be on transmission only.
Leader to squadron, prepare to launch.
Kaleel?
Later.
- It begins.
- Yes.
For us.
For Earth it ends.
Two minutes to stargate.
Once we pass through, no further transmissions.
We do everything exactly as I laid it out.
Are there any questions?
Good. Leader out.
I think I'm behaving quite admirably.
I'm being respectful, I'm following orders,
I'm not even going to analyse
Major Danton's attack strategy.
- Bidibidi. You're a real trouper.
- I'd like to think so.
Ryma, can you hear me?
Yes. I'm fine.
Hi, girls.
At the end of this shaft is a nice cool storage room.
How's she doing?
- She's OK.
- I think I can make it.
Bring her across this ledge and right down beneath the hole here and I'll throw you a rope.
OK, now, be careful.
That's it.
OK.
Put this around you.
I'll pull you up one at a time.
Put that around yourself and put the rope on top of it.
All right.
All right, Wilma, you're next.
Oh...
Approaching stargate.
Punch in destination four-eight-zero-seven-K.
Let's get out of here.
Great. Let's go.
It appears the armada has left the ground and is waiting for us.
We've failed, Twiki.
Bidibidibidi.
For the first time, I agree with you.
- We gotta warn Duke.
- Let's a make a run for those last two ships.
- Sounds good to me. Come on.
- No, my friends.
There are others who feel as I do.
We have stolen weapons and explosives.
If I can convince them that we have a chance, maybe we can help.
But there couldn't be more than a dozen of you.
This is my world, Buck, my people.
I deserve the chance to fight for them just as you deserve the chance to fight for yours.
OK, good luck.
Good luck, Ryma.
- Wanna get those fighters?
- We'll have to take the pilots out.
They'll never know what hit them.
'Leader to squadron,
I'm breaking radio silence.'
You've no doubt seen what lies ahead of us.
We're too late.
'The armada on Vistula is taking off,
'and before we reach the combat vector, we'll be outnumbered almost ten to one.'
But it's no use turning back, they're on their way to Earth.
We fight them here or we fight them there, so ready your pulsar cannons, we're taking them on now.
And before we're through with them, they will have had one big fight on their hands.
Bidibidi. Right on!
- You didn't have to take out both guards.
- I got excited.
I think I've created a monster.
9-3 and 9-4, you're out of sequence.
You're off course.
Adjust to three-zero-nine, do you read?
9-3 and 9-4, respond.
You're headed directly for the enemy.
Adjust to three-zero-nine at once.
9-3 to Leader.
With all due respect, Galen, stick it.
One of our fighters seems to be trying to intercept them.
Kaleel, we'd just like to say we didn't care much for the sauna.
- That's Rogers!
- You're so beautiful when you're angry.
- He's escaped.
- It doesn't matter.
Any way we can raise Duke on this thing?
He should be on vector 92.4.
'Buck Rogers to Earth squadron leader, do you read?'
Major, it's a trick.
Rogers to Leader, do you read me?
'Buck Rogers to Leader.
'Leader, do you read me?'
I read somebody who's flying an enemy ship.
- Come on, Duke, it's me.
- If you're Rogers, who's the Juice?
What?
OJ Simpson! I told you all about him in the desert.
Played for the Buffalo Bills.
What are you waiting for, Captain?
Get your butt in formation.
I take it you mean mine as well, Major?
- Wilma! I mean, Colonel Deering.
- Right on both counts.
- 'What do you say, Buck?'
- Twiki?
We're both here, Captain Rogers.
Welcome home, as it were.
- Thanks, Theo.
- Bidibidi.
Listen, there's only one guy that matters.
He's at the back running the whole show.
You see him on the scanner?
If we knock him out, the rest'll turn tail, I guarantee.
Sounds like you're the red dog who's gonna sack the quarterback.
- You got it.
- OK, squadron, in we go.
'And listen to Buck, he's calling the plays.'
- The squadron from Earth?
- That is correct.
Eight?
There's only eight of them.
Eight of them against all of us!
Keep your eyes on that turkey in the back.
He's the one we want.
You guys open a hole, I'll nail him.
OK, take out these tackles.
What are they doing?
These Earth people fight like madmen.
Madmen or not, it seems to be working.
Prepare my personal cruiser.
Just to be safe.
Go!
- Duke, coming at you, two o'clock.
- I see him.
- I got him.
- I believe we're being pursued.
(Twiki) Curse you, Red Baron!
Stop them, you fools!
Nice double-teaming, whoever you are.
Gordon's the name. Thanks.
- Have we met?
- I don't think so. We're from different times.
I told you, Kaleel has called for his escape craft.
This is our chance. It's our only chance.
Ryma, there are so few of us.
And so few of them.
Most of them are in space.
This is our chance while the armada is losing and Kaleel is uncertain.
All right, let's go. Come on, let's go.
It's ready.
Bidibidibidi. Eat lead, sucker!
Lead? What lead?
Twiki, what are you talking about?
There's your hole, Red Dog.
Quarterback's all yours.
Your challenge is accepted.
Galen!
They've lost Galen.
The armada's just breaking apart and running.
My cruiser. I must get to my cruiser.
Buck, we did it! We did it! It worked!
- 'We did it!'
- Nice shooting, Captain Rogers.
Thanks, Major. Twiki.
- Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
- I've done that since before you were born.
- You think so?
- Young man, I know so.
Come on, we got some cleaning up to do downstairs.
Tie them up.
How did this happen?
Ryma. She and others stole some weapons, explosives.
They're coming for you.
How did it happen?
Kaleel, your cruiser. Come.
You... are a dead man,
Rogers.
I am?
Don't be afraid of him.
The only way he can harm you is if you're afraid of him.
That's right. That's why you couldn't kill Ryma, isn't it?
Stay back.
She didn't believe in you. Even those who hated you believed in you, so they died.
Stay back.
Your people's faith is what's real, not your power.
Stay back.
Go ahead, Kaleel, kill me if you can.
By the way, I know where you can get a good lawyer.
I was being used by Kaleel.
By Julio, by everyone.
I had no idea.
Obviously I am totally unsuited for this position.
The Food Directorate will have my resignation.
The same mistake as always!
Quit avoiding responsibility.
Clean up Vistula yourself.
I can't.
- I don't know how.
- Regis does.
Part of the reason he was taking cadet training was to avoid those things he saw happening on Vistula.
I always listened to Julio.
Never to my own son.
I can't blame you for hating me all these years.
But now, will you help me now?
You and Ryma both.
Of course we will.
I have a feeling Vistula's in very good hands.
I think that means we're excused.
- I feel like celebrating. Let's do something.
- Sorry, I already have plans.
- How about you?
- I'm the one she's got plans with.
Let's get something straight right now.
- You're coming with us.
- Yeah?
Yeah!
Yeah, well...
Now!
See anything?
You think it's deserted?
If they've left with the treasure,
Richard won't be pleased.
If there ever was a treasure.
One more flight.
- John.
- Cease firing!
I speak for Richard Lionheart...
...King of England.
Lord of half of France...
...and thereby overlord of this domain.
I'm speaking for myself.
- Where are your soldiers?
- Run off.
- Where is the Lord of Chaluz?
- He led them.
Ask if he knows about the treasure.
Left me with the women and children and no weapons.
Here am I with one eye, collecting arrows.
And you think I've got a bow to shoot them with?
My king thinks your lord is keeping treasure from him.
It's my orders to get it.
People say it was found by Jean the ploughman.
- Great gold statue, 3 foot long.
- That's the one.
I was with him when they found it.
What we dug up was a rock.
We're fighting for a rock?
You wanna look?
Out there in the turnip field.
We couldn't lift it, so we left it.
What I've come to say is...
...if there's to be a fight,
I'm all there is. Come and get me.
You're a mad old man.
What now?
I want to give that rock to Richard.
Let's find the turnip field.
John.
What kind of siege is this?
- Where's Lord Chaluz and my treasure?
- Gone.
My treasure? Gone?
The lord is gone.
Your treasure never was.
A gold statue, 3 foot long.
I want it.
- Captain.
- Yes, my lord.
I ordered you to take this castle.
- Yes, my lord.
- Well, take it.
Bring it down and get my statue.
They surrender, and your statue is a rock.
I want it done.
- There is no treasure.
- Do it.
There are no soldiers, just some children and a mad old man.
And what's that to me?
Well, it should mean something.
Is that disapproval, Robin?
Am I in the wrong?
I followed you 20 years.
I fought in the Crusades and France.
I'll fight a soldier...
...but I won't slaughter children for gold.
I ordered it.
I command you.
You do it! You're a bastard, you'll enjoy it.
Damn right I'll do it!
Mercadier!
Arrest those two!
I'll have their heads on pikes.
I want these walls down. I want every damned head!
Lionheart.
Lionheart!
You are a pig!
Good God!
Well...
...so it was a stone.
- Is this a barber surgeon?
- Yes, my lord.
I look after your men, sire.
- With much success?
- Yes.
- You've seen to John and Robin?
- Under guard.
Come on, come on.
The patient's cold, and the doctor sweats.
The arrow will be hard to reach.
That should make it all the more worthwhile.
Well, you heard it, Mercadier.
I told him to attack, he told me no.
I ought to kill him for it.
- Will you?
- I don't know. It depends on my mood.
I killed all of them this afternoon except the old man. I liked his eye.
But, Robin...
We've been friends, you see, for 20 years.
I met him in Nottingham for the first time.
I needed men for the Crusade.
Robin was the best.
Well, get on with it.
I'll die of old age at this rate.
So off we went to do great things.
We led 300,000 men to the Holy Land, and came back on a boat with 50.
Not at all what we intended.
Christ!
I do what has to be done.
I have no choice.
But Robin judges me.
He always does.
The peasant bastard!
Judge a king!
Butcher.
I'll show you how it's done.
King's blood.
Remember it.
It's cold.
I don't like the dark.
Mercadier, how long to Chaluz?
Half a league?
Sire.
A little rest and then I'll attend to John and Robin.
What would you do?
Kill the women and children?
But they're all dead and we're in here.
- No one forced you.
- You did.
You nodded.
What do you want me to do?
I know.
What did I get us into?
I could have talked to Richard.
I could have tried.
Well, he is a bloody bastard.
Are we any better?
We serve him.
He's our king.
I took him for a great king...
...when we were robbing abbots, giving pennies to the poor.
It didn't seem much compared to rescuing the Holy Land.
How can you eat?
I'm hungry.
I reckon it's a good life to have reached 40.
We've both passed it, and look at us!
My poor old dad and all the dads before him...
...lived in Barnesdale.
All they ever knew was one town.
I've known a king...
...travelled the world, seen Jerusalem.
Oh, the sand was blowing and the walls were miles away, but...
I think I've had a good life.
Do you think Richard will kill us?
I don't know him anymore.
I don't know the man.
Well, if we go, we go.
Is that your idea of dying?
I don't know.
You'd think I'd learn.
I've seen enough of it.
I'll tell you something.
I won't go quietly.
Come here.
Bend down.
If I had not met you, think what I'd have missed.
The king will see you now.
Come on.
Your Majesty.
We are celebrating our demise.
I fancied leaving from a larger stage.
But a funny fellow, my physician...
I've already had him hanged.
It seemed fair.
Wine! A bucket of it.
But you're not for hanging.
You're for cutting up.
I would've done it already but for this.
- Will that be all, my lord?
- All?
Damn your "all"!
All done.
All over.
My father cursed me when he died.
I killed him, and he felt resentful.
He'd have loved all this.
I said a bucket.
A bucket!
John's the next king.
You remember John.
John Lackland they called him.
Now he gets all the land.
Christ, why did I have no children?
Never cared for England.
Never really there.
Not even as a corpse!
They're planting me in France, by my father!
Take something, Robin.
Nothing, sire.
Oh, he sulks.
He pouts. He gives his life to Richard, and he's sorry.
You don't know sorrow.
I was a king.
My mother...
She'll be 80 soon, the bitch.
I've sent for her.
Do you think she'll come?
Bucket.
Clever fellow, death is.
I've tried to find him on my terms.
God knows I've tried.
Ask for something, damn you!
It's too late.
There's nothing left.
There's still your life.
You take me as an equal.
You always did.
I'll carve you yet, you peasant bastard.
Mercadier!
My sword!
While I'm still king of England,
I'll...
Richard!
Richard. Richard, it's me.
I know it's you.
You couldn't leave me, could you?
You're free of me.
I'll let you go.
What will you do without me now, jolly Robin...
...now I'm dead?
That's that.
What now?
We watched him die. He saw us there.
He won't mind if we miss the funeral.
Where do we go? Which way?
North.
Why north?
England's there.
Let's go home, John.
There she is!
I'll race you. Come on!
- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure.
This way.
- A lot of thorns can grow in 20 years.
- I know these woods.
Good place to pass the night.
We're going through.
What's that?
- Deer.
- Deer?
Someone's seen us. Come on.
I can see it!
- I can't even see you.
- That's the top of my tree.
I told you this was the way.
There's nothing left.
What did you expect to find?
I don't know. I never thought...
John!
Quick, Robin.
There!
All right, boy.
Jesus, Rob, mine's an old man!
Rob, Rob... Robin?
It's me, Tuck. Tuck and Will!
Will? Will!
Robin! You've come home!
And evil Prince John
Took one look at his sword
And fled to his castle
And prayed to the Lord
Follow him, follow him
Bloody and brave
I'll follow bold Robin
From here to the grave
They've turned us into heroes.
You didn't make it up?
I don't know where they come from.
They're everywhere.
We go from town to town.
How do you make a living?
While I take confessions...
...he takes the horses.
Everywhere we go they want to hear about your deeds.
We didn't do them.
I know that.
I think I'll go to Barnesdale in the morning. See my dad.
He died, John. Years ago.
Wouldn't have known me anyway.
What happened here?
Did Marian...?
Is she still alive?
Last time we passed Nottingham.
She lives down Kirkly way.
Lovely girl.
Haven't thought of her in years.
And the sheriff?
Still rules the county, as powerful as ever.
Those were good days, fighting him.
What about the rest of us?
They died or went away.
When the Crusades ended and you didn't come again...
...we took you to be dead.
Like Richard.
Aye, Richard, well...
I mean, King John must be mad.
His own kind have turned on him.
The kingdom is falling apart.
His queen is 12 years old and all he does is stay in bed with her.
And you know he's fighting with the pope.
You can't hear Mass or take Holy
Communion anywhere in England.
The time for us is now.
The people would come to you if you called them.
Fight the king?
Then why did you come back?
Not to fight.
Sing us a song, Will.
One that really happened.
About Marian.
About Marian? Oh, aye.
Marian, now let's see...
Still, it would be something, wouldn't it, Rob?
Not at my age.
No!
All right, come on, you.
You too. Hack the post.
My arms are getting tired.
Dolt! Get up.
They never learn.
No, no, no.
Put your bloody weight behind it.
All right!
I'll take two men at once.
The rest of you pay attention.
You...
...and you.
Any questions?
Tie that rope over there.
My lord sheriff!
Yes, my lord.
It's time to go.
Sir Ranulf.
In my domain, never tell me, always ask.
Taxes, what you got?
One egg. Put it down.
- One chicken, Sam the Herdsman.
- Slow down a bit.
She won't be able to pay...
You have to work and pay taxes like anybody else.
Hey! He's taken my egg.
He can't do that.
What am I gonna do?
Now what am I gonna do?
Watch it.
- Aren't we going to Nottingham?
- I thought we'd go by Kirkly first.
- Kirkly's this way.
- Aye, but Marian's up there.
- Up there?
- Well, aye.
- That's Kirkly Abbey.
- Aye, so it is.
What's she doing there?
She's lived there for 18 years.
A nun! She can't be!
Not my Marian.
You'll see.
- I won't know what to say.
- She'll think of something.
This will help the pain.
Hello, the abbey!
Damn!
Forgive me. It's the sheriff.
I have a busy day.
Hello.
John, you go in.
I never said goodbye, she might be angry.
Better yet, leave it for another day.
You there!
What in hell do you want?
This is Kirkly Abbey?
Yes, and I'm the abbess.
Who are you?
Good God, it's Marian.
Robin.
- What are you doing in that costume?
- Living in it.
Well, I've come home to you, Marian.
The wars are over.
I'm here.
It's Mother Jennet now.
You can trot right back to Jerusalem.
You're angry.
I haven't thought of you in 20 years.
Give me a smile.
Invite me in.
Come back tomorrow.
I'll be gone.
- The sheriff's due. I'm off to prison.
- Off to prison?
Marian! What did you say?
Damn the man!
- Mother Jennet...
- They'll be here for me soon.
- You're in no danger, carry on.
- But...
No services, but help all those who come as best you can.
Marian.
- What happened? Explain.
- I haven't time.
- But the sheriff? What did you do?
- God's work. That's what I do.
- I can save you.
- I have nothing to be saved from.
- I don't want you.
- You've got me.
- I like the way you look.
- More than I can say for you.
So this is your room.
And I thought I knew you.
What's happened to you?
Good things.
I work hard. I've studied herbs and medicines. I love my life.
- And when the sheriff comes...
- What's he coming for?
I'm the abbess.
The king's ordered the clergy out of England. I'm not going.
When he comes he'll find me doing what I do.
- You mean to let him take you?
- God's with me.
- He didn't help us on the Crusades.
- Rob! Horsemen!
- Wait there.
- But it's my life, Robin.
You're a fool.
How many are they?
- Six!
- I like the odds.
My lord sheriff.
Robin.
Still not dead?
Not for want of trying.
You look well, all things considered.
- How was the Crusade?
- A disappointment.
After all these years, look at us.
I'm just a former captain.
You're still the sheriff.
No advancement.
I can read and write.
Makes you suspect.
Not a duke in 20 reads a word.
Correct, my lord?
Books are for clerks.
How's Mother Jennet?
You find her changed?
I didn't find her. She'd gone off.
Two decades and I missed her by a day.
That's odd. I sent her warning and she answered, " Come and get me. "
Well, we've both come for nothing.
- So be it.
- I'm ready.
- That's the woman?
- It is.
- By my authority...
- Who's this oaf?
- Sir Ranulf.
- I'm your prisoner.
- Come back!
- Let go...
Release her!
- Can't you grow up?
- I'm saving you.
- Arrest them all.
- Not enough men.
- I'm here. I'll do it.
- You'll what?
In King John's name,
I charge you. Yield!
I'm trying to.
- Give her to me.
- Here.
- I warned him not to.
- Robin.
Oaf or not, he serves the king.
You're still free.
- Let me have her and you can go.
- I can't do that.
- Then I shall have to hunt you down.
- Good hunting, sheriff.
- God help you, Robin.
- Lf he will.
So that's Robin Hood.
He's a dead man.
Yes.
But not just anyone's. He's mine.
Can you get on your horse,
Sir Ranulf?
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Nothing hurts.
I couldn't let them take you.
Take me! I was going.
I'll save you from prison.
- That I can do.
- It's none of your affair.
I don't know how I look, but I'm not your Marian.
I can't imagine living in the world again.
- Come morning I'll go to the sheriff.
- Why? Who would it serve?
There's always God.
- You went crusading, didn't you?
- Some things are worth dying for.
They had souls too, the heathen that you killed.
If I should die in prison...
I'd rather not, but if it comes...
...it's for a reason.
I'll have stood for something.
But I won't have taken another life.
What will you do now?
Fight the sheriff?
More corpses?
Aren't you sick of it?
On the 12th of July, 1191...
...the mighty Acre fortress fell to Richard.
His one great victory in the Holy Land.
He was sick and never fought.
On August 20th, John and I were outside the city, watching...
...while every Moslem left alive was marched out in chains.
King Richard spared the richest for ransoming, took the strong for slaves.
And he took all the children and had them chopped apart.
When that was done, he had the mothers killed.
When they were all dead, 3000 bodies on the plain...
...he had them all opened up...
...so their guts could be explored for gold and precious stones.
Our churchmen on the scene, and there were many...
...took it for a triumph.
One bishop put on his mitre and led us all in prayer.
And you ask me if I'm sick of it.
Why didn't you come home then?
He was my king.
Come. Walk with me.
That's where the kitchen was...
...and over there we stored the ale.
And this...
Was this our house?
As small as that?
The door was here.
I tried so hard to keep it clean.
I was right to love you all those years ago.
It's odd, I know I loved you...
...but I can't remember how it felt...
...or who I was.
Of all things, I found peace most difficult to come by.
I suppose I took the church up out of anger.
It's a blur, but I think I thought...
...of all men, you would mind most if I married Jesus.
Not a good beginning.
For months, when it was time to sleep,
I'd think of you.
Oh, my confessions were the envy of the convent.
I said endless prayers.
Did dreadful penance, but...
...nothing helped but time.
I have found peace.
I don't dream about you anymore, Robin.
I'll see you back safely into Nottingham tomorrow.
I think one of my teeth is loose.
I never mean to hurt you...
...and yet it's all I ever do.
You never wrote.
I don't know how.
Did you sleep well?
- Did you?
- To Nottingham then.
The abbey first. My things were left behind, in the confusion.
- Well, you'll have to ride with me.
- I always did.
If you still know how.
- It won't be long.
- Mother Jennet!
They've been taken.
We were in the garden.
- The men came in.
- The sheriff and oaf?
We all ran. They caught and took the others.
- Took them all!
- Lf you'd kept out they'd be here now.
You think it's you he wants? It's me.
It's John and me.
- He's in his castle waiting.
- Take me to Nottingham.
- No, not you, we're going.
- I'll walk if I have to.
Take her to camp.
We'll join you later.
I wish I were a man.
I'd knock you down.
Now that's my Marian.
Nottingham.
There she is, John.
You look ridiculous!
He'll never come.
I know him.
He's a little bit in love with death.
He flirts. He teases.
I can wait.
They haven't changed a thing!
- Shall we go on?
- Why not? See what there is to see.
No harm in that.
- See anything?
- Not yet.
He knows we're coming.
He'll be waiting...
...watching.
Not a soldier anyplace.
So far.
- Ah, Robin.
- Where?
You can't see anything but a crowd.
I see a wagon with three horses.
One to pull, but two to push?
I'm almost sorry.
Now. At once.
Aye, sir.
What now?
We set up shop. Do you see a table?
Hey!
- Why not go out and get him?
- Why go out when he'll come in?
There they are.
It's no good being inside all day.
Walk where you like.
I don't understand what he means.
Hey, there! You, lad!
- That's not your table.
- It was empty.
No difference. What's mine's mine.
Now get off with you.
- I need it. I'll buy it from you.
- It's not for sale.
I'm good at faces.
I know you, don't I?
I could have sworn that...
That's not your wagon.
Fat man, been here all week from Bristol. He left this morning.
Be you thieves?
Take the lot.
- Fair's fair, that's too much.
- Listen.
If you don't move, I'm gonna have to split you from here...
...to there.
John.
It's madness going in there.
There's only one way in.
They'll bang the gate down on us.
We could always come back tomorrow.
Oh, look!
Skillets! London-made!
What? Just pots and pans.
Pots and pans!
Pots and pans!
Pots and pans, Sisters?
- There's a wagon beyond the gate.
- You're not supposed to be here.
- Can you see it?
- We can't buy pots, we're prisoners.
- God almighty! Do you see the wagon?
- You profaned God's name.
- Who are you?
- Jesus Christ...
A friend of Mother Jennet's, and if we don't leave, we'll all die.
Cut it, for chrissakes!
Move!
Up.
Where in hell are your crossbowmen?
Get them out here!
This isn't much better.
Those bloody nuns!
Hey!
After them!
God!
- There's Robin Hood.
- Which one?
Him!
- Mother! There's barely time...
- Go on!
Do as they ask!
- Robin!
- Jump!
- I'll hurt myself.
- For chrissakes.
That's him.
I should have taught you better.
Two old men, for Jesus' sake, two old men.
This one's still alive.
Take care of him.
As for the rest of them...
...take up their limbs and bury them.
You there!
- Raise it! Raise the gate!
- I can't, my lord. How?
I ought to let you go.
I'll bring him back.
Bring him back from Sherwood?
You won't even find him.
- I can do it.
- In full armour, in the woods?
You'll sink in the bogs.
I've tried it.
I've gone in after him.
I never even saw his archers.
Just the arrows in my soldiers' bodies.
I can get him, and you failed.
And you don't like it.
All right, get some men.
Raise the gates.
Here. Take this.
Give me your bow.
Get up there, keep watch.
Come on. Come on.
Come on!
I can't keep doing this kind of thing anymore.
Turn left!
- Turn left!
- No, no.
She never did have the touch for driving.
Do you think they'll come after us?
We'll hear from Will if they do.
There's not another Mother
Abbess like you.
Amen to that. You're a marvel.
Blood!
Oh! You fool.
You've put on weight.
Was this a day! I haven't had one like it since we left.
Neither have I. Did we really used to do this sort of thing?
All the time.
How did I bear it?
When I saw you on that wall,
I thought you were dead.
Why did I ever leave?
Let's take a look at you.
- Just a few bumps and bruises.
- All the same.
So many!
You had the sweetest body when you left.
Hard, and not a mark.
And you were mine.
When you left I thought I'd die.
I even tried.
I walked out into the woods...
...and laid down by a stream and cut myself.
Some damn fool forester came by, took me to the abbey. So they say.
No more scars, Robin.
It's too much to lose you twice.
I've never kissed a member of the clergy.
Would it be a sin?
They're coming in!
Tuck, we'll need your bow.
Right!
- Hasn't there been enough?
- I'll meet you at camp.
- Don't go.
- I just want to see who's hunting me.
Next time you ride into Sherwood, keep your visor down.
John! Wait.
I hold my office from the king himself.
I never liked your king.
You're his subject and his servant.
He's not king here. Not in Sherwood.
You're the ruler? Should I bow?
I wouldn't have you in my service, nobleman.
I've known your kind all my life.
You're everything I meant to fight.
You're the enemy.
You gobble red meat and we get bread and cheese.
The laws can't touch you and there's no crime you can be punished for.
We can shoot a deer and have our eyes put out.
This is my forest.
I'll live here as I like.
You come in again and I'll kill you.
Good.
- Was there fighting?
- Some.
You said you were only going to look.
My father worked honestly for years.
He left a pot, a blanket and a spoon.
The sheriff?
No, the oaf.
- You didn't kill him?
- No.
I told him this was my forest and I want to live here with you.
What are you looking for?
Some trace of Marian.
Or Mother Jennet.
Either one.
Good woman, Jennet.
Years of diligence it took to leave the flesh behind.
She could look at men and feel nothing.
See? She looks at you.
Touch her hand. Hold it.
Just as well.
She wouldn't feel anything.
I think of what I did and it makes no sense.
To want to die from wanting you!
Some other girl it must have been.
Let me hold you.
Robin...
Were there many women on your great Crusade?
- Lots.
- Don't tell me.
- As you wish.
- How many?
But they all looked like you.
Am I old and ugly?
Am I anything you'd want?
I've felt so little for so long.
Robin...
Hurt me.
Make me cry.
I can't stop smiling.
I don't mind.
Could there be two rooms to our house next time?
- And something for a floor?
- All right.
I'd like that.
And a bed with blankets?
And a chest for clothes, and...
Do you hear that?
Jesus Christ almighty!
Don't...
You do be Robin Hood, yes?
I'll be damned!
I told them in the market it was you.
It's Robin.
I told you so!
Robin's back in Sherwood, I said.
I led them since I knew the way.
They're mostly from farms round about here.
They're here to serve you and fight against that king.
Tuck! Give them all food.
So be it, then.
Go fight your sheriffs and your kings.
I love you and you make me proud.
If there were a way to turn time back just five minutes, I'd give my soul.
- You ladies there, where is the king?
- In the largest tent, of course.
So you go to the pope and you tell him...
...if his archbishop puts one foot in England, I'll cut his head off!
What's next?
John...
- Aren't you ever coming?
- Soon.
I clean all over. Want to look?
The court is here.
I don't mind.
I think you're pretty.
What in God's name do you want?
- Men, Your Majesty. Two hundred men.
- Two...!
- What for?
- To fight an enemy.
- What enemy? There are so many.
- Robin Hood.
I thought the man was dead.
He's back in Sherwood.
Can't the sheriff manage it?
Must I waste my time?
My army waits for me in Dover.
Good God, man!
These people have made a hero of him.
They're flocking to him.
He's become a legend.
Have you tried to fight a legend?
- Just my brother.
- But, sire...
...they mean to rise against you.
Do they?
Do they?
Be in Dover in the morning.
I'll give you men.
And you tell the sheriff I'll have
Robin's head, or I'll have his.
Either way, I'll win.
Are you sure these berries make it green?
Keep your bow arm straight and pull it to your chin.
- Like that.
- Which arm?
All right, two!
Three!
The king was generous.
He sends a message.
He wants Robin's head.
Or mine.
- Follow me.
- These troops are my command.
Not in my county. Follow me!
This way!
- What, here?
- This is close enough.
- How many?
- Enough.
And they're making camp.
There in the field?
- I'd thought they'd come in after us.
- They'll come.
- Will! Tuck!
- What's wrong?
The sheriff's here with an army.
A hundred soldiers.
- Where are they?
- Near Kirkly.
They'll be coming in at dawn.
I want us in position tonight.
These pears are absolutely delicious.
Damnedest thing.
He's still eating breakfast!
Still?
What's he waiting for? More men?
You'd think he had enough.
What do we do?
We wait and see.
Come on.
No, thank you.
Come on, come along!
Now!
Let's go!
Call your men to sword!
It's an attack, my lord.
Call to arms, foot soldiers!
What happened?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
We attacked. No one followed.
Are we to fight them in the open?
That seems to be the plan.
We'd be slaughtered.
Does he think we're fools?
That's what he's waiting for.
He's the fool, then.
He can sit out there forever.
He can't put a forest under siege.
That's how I see it.
He comes in, we've got him.
- We stay here.
- The man's mad.
You haven't asked what I think.
I think one madman's enough.
He's out there, Marian.
He expects me.
Let him.
The mist is rising.
You look so cold.
It's so beautiful, this place.
The woods just now. Full of noises...
...everything so alive.
I kept thinking...
...of all the death I've seen.
I've hardly lost a battle, and I don't know what I've won.
"The day is ours, Robin. "
And then it was tomorrow.
But where did the day go?
You're so beautiful.
Come and sit by me.
Do you love me?
Say it.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Nothing.
- You're going, aren't you?
- It's a possibility.
You heard John, and Will and Tuck.
They said it was madness.
Well...
Is that all being dead means?
"Well... "
I'll have more to say when the time comes.
Let it be God's time.
He'll take you soon enough.
Then it's all in his hands.
You think I'm gray and old.
Well, I'm not.
Oh, Robin, I'd be 20 for you if I could.
I'm all I ever was.
You saw me on the wall.
Yes.
And if you come back there'll be another morning, won't there?
And each time you'll be less.
Not Robin anymore.
- And then one day...
- You'll see.
No, I won't see.
Or hear the songs about bold Robin.
I'll be gone.
Leave? Why?
Because I'll do everything for you but mourn.
Go fight your sheriff, and may God go with you.
May the sun shine and the day be great.
But, Robin...
...I never want to know.
John.
I'll do anything you say.
I'll leave here.
I'll go as if he never found me.
Only stop him from this thing.
- What thing?
- His march against the sheriff.
- What?
- Didn't he tell you?
Fight the sheriff? Don't be mad.
It's four to one. We'd be slaughtered.
These are boys we've got.
They're farmers.
Tell him! You're the only one.
He'll listen.
Me? Say no to Rob?
Just this once.
We've always been together.
I'd be nothing without him.
I want him safe, that's all.
I'll leave.
What more do you want from me?
I haven't asked for anything.
You never liked me much.
- You're Rob's lady.
- Go on, say it.
You're Rob's lady.
Lf...
...you'd been mine,
I never would have left you.
Oh, damn you.
You've had him with you. You've had years! And I'm going to lose him.
- No, you won't.
- Oh, John!
Oh, John...
John.
I'll watch over him.
Don't cry.
He'll be back.
We're going out.
Yes, I know.
She told you?
Yes.
Well?
She asked me not to go.
And you decided what?
It's mad, Rob.
And?
Well...
I told her you'd be lost without me.
This may be the hardest part of the day.
I doubt it.
- Goodbye.
- What?
God keep you well.
If he so chooses.
Move!
All right, you men, put it here. And hold it!
Sit still!
Await your orders.
I knew you'd come.
Of all men, just for you.
I know.
- I want to settle this with champions.
- One of yours against mine?
The winner takes the day.
Why should I, Robin?
The odds are four to one.
Why should I make them even?
I'm one champion.
And I'm the other?
If I lose, my men are yours.
- Without me, they won't trouble you.
- And if I lose?
Your soldiers leave the field.
Those are my orders.
Are they clear?
I let this rabble go?
Just march away?
Those are my orders.
Leave the field!
I promised I'd watch out for you.
I promised her.
She's gone, in any case.
- I'll kill him, Rob, if you don't.
- No!
What you do is keep my word.
I'll see you, Johnny.
Off you go.
God be with us, Robin.
Come on.
Whoa!
Will you not yield?
No!
I'm tired.
Marian!
I couldn't stop him.
For the love of God, Robin!
All right?
We've got to get the men into the woods.
You're a stout lad.
- What's your name?
- They call me Little John.
Well met.
Let's see how tall you are.
Robin!
- Look at you.
- You came back.
Can you hold him?
We'll take him to the abbey.
My medicines are there.
I thought I'd seen the last of you.
A woman of your word.
I'm glad you came back.
Up there.
Stand still!
I wonder where the day went?
Vespers it must be.
What kind of abbey is this?
No one rings the hours.
Are you in great pain?
A little weary.
I've had worse.
He went down well, the sheriff did.
Brave man.
And the better one today.
The years...
The years, they whittle at you.
I should give it up, you know.
I doubt I'll have a day like this again. And yet...
John!
- Lf they should follow us...
- I'll wait outside.
- I did my best.
- I know.
This will help the pain.
He's something, John is.
No one's gentler in the world...
...nor half as terrible.
Did you see him?
I should go and tend my men.
Brave boys, all of them.
I meant to...
I like your medicine.
There's no pain at all.
We'll have a time in the forest.
You'll tend me till I'm well again.
And then...
...great battles!
We'll have a life to sing about.
My...
...legs are cold.
I know.
They're numb.
I... I said you would have no pain.
What have you done?
John!
I'm poisoned!
Help me!
No one can help you now.
Jesus, Marian!
Why?
I love you.
More than all you know.
I love you more than children.
More than fields I've planted with my hands.
I love you more than morning prayers or peace or...
...or food to eat.
I love you more than sunlight...
...more than flesh or joy...
...or one more day.
I love you...
...more than God.
I'd never have a day like this again, would I?
Well, it's better this way.
Marian.
It's all right.
Rob.
Look at you.
It's all right.
It's all right.
No.
No.
Give me my bow.
Where this falls, John...
...put us close...
...and leave us there.

Mr. Asby?
It's me, Jesse.
Just go about what you're doing.
Hello?
John?
Can you hear me?
What's the matter? John?
Answer me, John!
Can you hear me?
John, are you there?
Yeah.
I've got to see you.
- Is this Cal?
- It's me.
It's your brother.
Does he know you're here?
At 2:00 a. m., man?
I'm at the office.
That's your problem, baby.
Where have you been all day?
Around.
I've been trying to reach you.
I put $5,000 in your bank account this afternoon.
Payment in advance.
For what?
Pick me up now. I'm in deep trouble.
What's up?
Get here. Fast.
I'll tell you when I see you.
Yeah, okay.
I've been trying to reach my sister, Arna.
I've got to warn her.
Have you heard from her?
I think I can put a hand on her.
If you can reach her, tell her to get home and keep the doors locked till we get there.
Yeah, okay.
Check to see if there are any other bodies inside.
Looks like Cal Asby to me.
What's he look like to you?
What's left of him.
Maybe you two had a little conversation before this happened?
What did he tell you, Shaft?
Stay away from black honkies with big flat feet.
Looks like there's only one dead, Captain.
I was hoping maybe you could shed some light on that.
He never hurt anyone in his life.
He loved this community...
...and everybody here loved him.
He was planning to break ground for that Child Care Clinic...
...over in Harlem sometime next month.
But now...
How did you feel about that?
With him.
All the way.
Don't shit me, Kelly!
You fought him tooth and nail about laying bread on that ghetto clinic!
Fellas...
...help me move this next door.
After all, I can't leave it here.
Right there is fine.
Thanks a lot.
Would you close the door on your way out, please?
Listen, before I forget...
...have Jack check those two front doors on the chopper.
I don't know what the hell you got the idiot there for anyway.
Because he's the best.
What do you think I got him there for?
Sorry, Gus.
I'll go use the phone in the bedroom.
Kelly says the safe's empty.
Gus, do you hear me?
Kelly said the safe's empty!
Pour.
I don't understand how Kelly says the safe is empty.
Did you ask Mr. Kelly to pop by?
Yes.
I told him if he didn't have the $250,000,
I'd personally have his ass.
Possibly Mr. Kelly needs a little more time.
You shouldn't crowd people, Andy.
It's not cool.
You've got to give a man a little elbow room.
I'll give him elbow room, black son of a bitch!
You have a tendency to overreact, Andrew.
You see...
...Mr. Kelly means not only the $250,000 he owes me...
...but, remember, he's got the key to Queens.
Relax.
Relax.
I don't want too many boys hanging around.
- They won't be there.
- Make sure they're not there.
What're you buzzards doing here?
You go to a lot of funerals, Shaft.
Willy and me, one day we'll drop in on yours.
Real soon!
You're not invited.
In that case, we'll send you a wreath with love.
What about Asby and his numbers?
What will we do about that business?
Ain't our war, Willy.
Kelly's in charge now.
We got enough troubles of our own.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! What happened?
Keep an eye on her.
Right on time, Mr. Kelly.
Just trying to help, man.
Yeah, right.
Look, do me a favor.
When you got a moment, let me take a look at the partnership papers.
Okay.
I want to thank you for being so helpful.
At a time like this, John, it's the least I can do.
Arna tells me you'll be handling her end of the business.
You don't have any objections to that, do you?
No, no.
Since you are in such a bereaved state,
I might hang around and help you out.
Who knows, between both of us...
...maybe we can figure out who knocked off Cal.
Lately we seem to be traveling in the same circles:
Bombings, funerals...
...houses of the deceased.
Sad circles.
Let's go to the precinct and talk about it.
Okay, baby.
Get in the vehicle.
I got my own short.
I'll follow you.
Okay.
Come on! Come on!
What's going on here?
Chief, get this bastard off my back.
You little son of a bitch!
Tell him I got rights! Tell him!
What did he do?
Deli on Northern Boulevard for $300, gas station for $27...
...then he run a stolen Chevy into a squad car!
I got rights!
Fuck your rights! Go sue the city.
Come on.
Come on, kid.
Relax.
Don't you know they're trying to rehabilitate you here?
You try any of that shit on me and none of us will walk out of this room!
Come on, Shaft.
Sit down, Shaft.
I'll sit when I'm sure that ape will stay in his cage.
What the hell do you want with me?
What are you into with Cal Asby and Johnny Kelly?
I was into a funeral for an old friend.
Now, how's that any business of yours?
It's been the business of every man in this building...
...ever since Asby and Kelly set up a numbers racket in Queens.
- What's your connection with it?
- What's wrong with numbers?
A man needs a little action.
You've got off-track betting here in New York.
You've got a lottery system all over the world.
Everybody needs a long shot.
Now, ain't that right, Captain?
I'll throw up if you keep lecturing me on the psychodynamics...
...of what people need.
It's against the law, that's what's wrong with it.
Well, I'm glad you clued me in, Captain.
Get us some coffee, Cooper.
You talking to me, Captain?
What do you want me to do, sing?
Get the coffee, man!
Make mine black.
You didn't have to say that to Cooper.
Something just came over me, Captain.
I'm really ashamed.
I'll tell you what I got, Shaft.
You jiving Asby's sister...
...he catches a bomb...
...and Kelly takes over.
Maybe you two got it bracketed...
...and now you figure to run the numbers in Queens.
Like that so far?
Rap on.
And at the funeral, who do I see you with?
Bumpy.
And you figure I'm bringing Bumpy in?
Why not?
You finger Asby and bring in Bumpy.
You know, you private shits will do anything for a buck.
You pull Harlem and Queens together, and hell, man, you're fat.
Do you just sit around and think these things up...
...or do they just come to you in a flash?
How come we never hassled Cal Asby?
Go ahead, ask me.
'Cause he was probably laying heavy bread on you guys every month at the precinct.
He ran a wheel, okay.
Poor man's racetrack.
But man, you can't cut that out.
But he didn't deal in shit, whores or loan-sharking.
Everything was cool.
And now, with Asby dead...
...and Kelly running things, who knows?
Anybody can move into the vacuum.
Maybe your pal, Bumpy.
Or Mascola from downtown.
You've heard of Mascola?
Does a lot of TV work every time a Senate Crime Committee's in town.
Three sugars.
With cream.
So what do you want from me?
Put the word out.
Nobody better try and come in here and mess up the status quo.
And nobody's coming in here to sell shit to our kids...
...or put whores on our streets.
Is this program being recorded, or we going out live?
Look, man, I can cool you off the old-fashioned way.
We have a nice steel pad back there.
Okay, let's go.
But I can't be any help to anyone in a steel pad.
Okay, Shaft.
On the street.
But if you're smart...
...you'll keep in touch.
Asby-Kelly man.
Santa Claus.
You have hit the number, brother.
Count it.
Thank you, brother.
Same thing tomorrow, right?
Asby-Kelly man.
How are you, brother?
802 is the figure for today, brother.
That's $3 on your wife's burial policy...
...$1.50 on yours and...
She says she wants 717.
717. Fifty cents.
Thank you, brother.
Hey, man, please, don't shoot!
Take the money.
I've got a wife and six kids and an old Buick to support.
You won't get hurt as long as you keep talking.
Where's Kelly operating out of?.
Man, I can't.
Please, brother. Take the money.
I'm just the runner, man.
Where?
- Brother, I can't! Kelly will kill me, man!
- I said, "Where?"
"Every night when moon come up
"Big Bamboo he fill my cup
"Round 'bout six when moon come down
"Big bamboo nowhere around"
Shut up!
You used to say I had an operatic voice.
You were gonna give me voice lessons.
Just knock it off!
No damn fluid!
Maybe it's the wick.
It's the wicks that always go first.
Bitch!
Are you going to hang around here all day and shake?
Here, I pay the rent.
If I want to hang around all day that's my business!
You think I need you?
I don't see you packing.
Just watch!
- What the hell are you doing?
- You better not!
That's just for openers.
Bitch!
Yeah?
So?
So, it's you.
Another day's gone by and we're getting nothing but weather reports.
Easy on Mr. Kelly, now.
Look, man, I need more time.
You have a friend in court.
The man says to go easy on you.
You might suggest if he's in the neighborhood, he stop by...
...and we have a little chat.
The boss says if you wouldn't mind...
...get your ass over here right now!
No class. Simply no class.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.
Rita, I said I'll see you in a couple of hours.
Make it a couple of years!
Yes?
Kelly there?
We don't give out that kind of information.
Tell Kelly that John Shaft wants him.
If he's not in my office by 5:00,
I'll take this door off the hinges.
Why wait till 5:00?
Obviously you're not a friend of the family.
Not anymore, I'm not.
Not after a nasty slap in the face.
Best thing for that is an ice pack.
Why, thank you, Mr. Shaft.
Why don't you come in and show me how to apply it?
On second thought...
...no ice.
You might catch cold.
I suppose it's immodest of me to walk around like this in front of a stranger.
But any enemy of John Kelly's is an old friend of mine.
Funny...
I used to love the guy.
When do you expect him back?
I hope never.
So, what am I doing in a place like this?
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you take your things off?.
Wait a minute.
I didn't mean all that!
Baby, look, it's hot in here.
Besides, I don't want you to feel overdressed.
You'll never guess where we found it.
How many times have I told you not to frisk our guests?
Mr. Kelly is no hoodlum.
You're sitting on my table, Mr. Kelly.
That's better.
I thought this was going to be a friendly conversation, Mr. Kelly.
I've been carrying that piece since I was 10 years old.
A lousy. 25 caliber.
I always figured he was a faggot.
Watch it!
Bring me up to the moment on our situation.
It's not good, Gus. It's not good at all.
How so, Mr. Kelly, how so?
Pascal, give me the parsley.
He had the money in the safe.
You're sure about that?
We signed the papers.
He was buying me out. In cash.
I had a couple of my boys outside.
They saw him take a shopping bag...
...and something out of the safe and go into the funeral home.
The money must've been in that bag.
Has it occurred to you, Mr. Kelly, that when you blew up your partner...
...that you may have also blown up my money?
Yeah, I had nightmares about that, too.
But then I've got a Photostat copy of the bomb squad report.
There was no money in the debris, so it's got to be somewhere in that funeral home.
- Nice.
- Thank you.
I'd invite you to dinner, but I suggest you have more pressing engagements.
Like getting up $250,000...
...by tonight.
There you go again, creating pressures and posing deadlines.
No, Mr. Kelly.
What I had in mind was something altogether different.
Not only do I want the money you've gambled away on my crap tables...
- ... but I want half of your action in Queens.
- Come on, man!
"Come on, man! "
We should make superb partners,
Mr. Kelly.
After all, we're both creative men.
Who else plays the clarinet better than I do?
- Or makes a better Shrimp Newburg?
- No way!
It's all tied in to the insurance and the funeral operation out front.
And besides, Cal's sister owns his share.
If you want your half, you get it from her.
You can hardly expect me to give up my half.
Hey, look, man.
She's got a guy. His name is John Shaft, and he's a bad dude.
I can't mess with her half.
Ever hear of John Shaft?
You see, Mr. Kelly, nothing to worry about.
Pascal hasn't ever even heard of him.
He's already into it.
He's sitting on my shoulders, Gus.
I can't make a move!
Could we be of assistance with the problem?
Assuming, of course, that we're partners 50-50 in your wheel.
Try to think fast, Mr. Kelly.
- You'll take care of Shaft?
- Depend on it.
Where the hell have you been with the goddamned elevator?
You ought not talk to a lady that way.
Where's your fucking manners anyway?
Do you have to go?
I've got to split, baby.
Rita?
Still want to see him?
Drive that cat crazy?
Rita! Open the door!
Rita, open the damn door!
Got a back entrance?
Rita, open the door!
Goddamn it, open the fucking door!
What's the matter with you?
Rita, open this goddamn door!
What the fuck! Kick the son of a bitch in!
I said, "open the door! "
Rita, open the damn door!
What's the matter with you?
You mean this door?
Ciao, baby!
Open the damn door, Rita!
What's wrong with you, woman?
Open the door!
Will you open the goddamn door?
What the hell's the matter with you?
Open this damn door!
I'll kick the son of a bitch in, in a minute!
I can't believe it!
But there it is, in writing.
Sorry, baby.
I wanted to open your eyes earlier.
Let you know what Kelly's scene was.
But to do that, I had to let you know what your brother was into.
Unbelievable, especially when you think...
...about the child care center he was going to build.
Your brother was a good man.
At least he put the money back where it came from.
That's more than I can say for Kelly.
Exactly what do these papers mean?
It's simple. Kelly was borrowing money from your brother for years...
...to pay off his gambling debts.
Your brother finally drew the line.
That paper is an agreement from Kelly for his interest in the business...
...in return for $250,000.
If your brother was alive,
Kelly would be broke and out on his ass.
The rest of it is obvious.
Come on, come on.
- What is it?
- Upstairs. Move it.
Flowers.
- Leave them at the door.
- Sorry, you've got to sign.
Just a minute.
Who put the contract out on me?
Get some things together and let's get out of here!
- I want to see your boss.
- What about?
Insurance.
Only insurance he needs is me, sweet pea.
I'm not here selling insurance, and you know it. Where's Bumpy?
He ain't buying no coffins either, unless he's buying yours.
Bring him in.
He's clean, Boss.
Clean as Mr. Clean himself.
Clean Kelly, pristine and clean.
Have a drink.
Thanks, Bumpy.
Take a seat.
No, man, I'm on the move.
Ain't a damn thing wrong with standing.
I've been expecting you, Kelly.
- What kind of help do you need?
- What makes you think I need help?
Man don't come calling on his competitors unless he needs help.
We're not competitors, Bumpy.
Anybody in my business is a competitor.
A man who knows my game can always...
...come into my neighborhood and try to play it.
So, what do you want?
I'm shopping for a new partner.
Kind of dangerous being your partner.
How much is it gonna cost me?
...up front.
What does that buy me?
25 percent of the action.
Gus Mascola would ask you for a hell of a lot more than that, baby.
How about 50?
No.
Why don't we make it 60 percent of the action?
What's that extra 10 percent?
Just in case we need a contract on Mascola.
You're really putting the screws to me!
He might not like the idea of this new arrangement between brothers.
- He might want to take counteraction.
- I can handle that.
But...
...there is one more little problem.
Nothing we can't handle together, brother.
If Cal's little sister owns half the business and you own 60...
...that don't leave nothing for me.
Now look, baby boo...
...there's troubles and troubles.
This one is yours.
Yeah, Boss?
Willy will show you out.
See that he gets the money first thing in the morning.
Yeah, okay.
Boss, you trust this Negro here?
Hold it, Willy!
You don't have to worry about trusting a dead man.
Cigarettes?
No, thank you, baby.
What else can you offer me?
Well, I'm off at 4:00.
Hey, baby, where's your woman?
Traveling kind of light tonight.
$100 says that back door doesn't lead to the parking lot.
I'm not a gambling woman.
I'm a gambling man.
I thought it was my action you were digging here.
Never took you for a gambler...
...but if that's your meat, that's the door.
You're pushing mighty hard, my man.
Maybe I ought to push the boys in the back who've been taking all your money.
Extend him for another $5,000 and not one cent more, do you understand?
Listen, Gus...
You told me you would take care of Shaft.
That's what I told you.
Well, he's right out there at a ringside table.
He's not here to see the floorshow.
There's gonna be trouble.
That's fine with me.
We made a deal!
And I just called it off.
You see, I made a test run, a sort of a "house call" on Mr. Shaft.
It didn't work out so well.
It cost me a dead second cousin...
...and a friend's kid brother with two hits in the chest.
Aren't you gonna settle the score?
Who's he here to settle with, me or you?
You're a gambler. So am I.
Now, I'm betting that you're Shaft's target for tonight.
Suppose I just let him do his thing, say, knock you off.
You're the one who totaled his girlfriend's big brother.
Come to think of it, why should I do anything to keep you alive?
You haven't even come up with the money you owe me yet.
Tomorrow, I told you! You got it?
Have you considered renewing your partnership with Cal Asby?
Come on, man, he's dead!
Precisely!
You don't know what that dude is into.
He's Bumpy's boy.
You understand that?
They're looking to take over my wheel in Queens.
Shaft's working for Bumpy?
Now you're getting smart.
We'll send Mr. Shaft back to Bumpy...
...with a message they understand uptown.
Let's go.
It's in there.
Let him in.
Are you looking for me?
I've been hearing quite a bit about you,
Mr. Shaft. You're quite a boy.
I prefer "man. "
All right.
"Man. "
What brings you around here?
Forgot to tip your boys when they delivered the flowers.
The only reason I don't spill your guts out right here and now, "man"...
...is that it's easier for me to send you back to Bumpy with my message...
...than to call Western Union.
And the message is:
"You keep the hell out of Queens! "
What round did you go out in, man?
You ain't pretty as you used to be.
You better see a plastic surgeon about your condition.
- What condition?
- Your mouth is too close to your asshole!
Sit down, Shaft. Save your energy.
That's real professional work.
Who did the job?
He was talking when he should've been listening.
Dude named Mascola.
Figured I was working with you.
"Stay out of Queens. " That's what the man said.
What business have I got in Queens?
Has Kelly been here to see you?
Lots of cats come and go around here.
Figured you ought to know,
Kelly's been hanging around with Mascola.
Yeah, that Kelly. He's a busy boy.
Deal here, deal there.
Undesirable character.
Wait outside, Willy.
What do you want from me, Shaft?
I didn't ask you for anything.
Just delivered Mascola's message.
I'll see him tomorrow.
That damn Italian is serious!
Willy! Get your ass in here!
I'm coming, Bumpy!
Used to be cowboys and Indians, now it's us and them!
You call Kelly.
You tell him his loan's been canceled.
And tomorrow you'll go along with Shaft and get that Mascola...
...'cause I want him bad, real bad.
Now, get to it, baby!
You sure were right about that waterbed!
I thought you'd dig that, baby.
$10,000 for this thing!
You have to be kidding!
You want me to look nice, don't you?
What do I care what you look like with your clothes on?
Service.
Haven't you had enough service?
Zip my dress, please.
I have a tendency to spoil you, baby.
Do it, do it, do it.
Is this trip absolutely necessary?
Just wash the window, man.
Again?
You love it.
I love it.
What are they doing in there?
They've already done it.
Now it's our turn.
I've got to go.
You're looking good, baby.
Do your number.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
I'll take the white boy and give anybody 6-to-5...
...it don't go another two rounds.
You got trouble with him, Junior!
Come on, man!
Come on!
What the hell did you come along for, the ride?
I heard you was good. I want to see how good you can do your thing.
Come on!
Cook, Junior!
That's how it's done, Junior.
I ought to step on your damn throat...
...but I'd rather see you and Kelly fry for killing Cal Asby.
And he's my next visit. I owe it to him!
And he owes me!
Like what, $250,000?
I see you've done your homework, boy.
Let's get out of here!
You gonna leave him like that?
A man can fall out the window, you know.
And him, too.
Don't you know we already got enough shit on the sidewalk?
I'm sorry, Gus.
Where the hell were you?
You sent me out to get the peppers.
Did you get the real hot ones?
Yeah, I got the real hot ones.
Good.
I'll tell you what you do.
Take them one at a time...
...and you shove them up your ass!
Have you been keeping this room clean back here?
Tell me, Jesse...
...did you see Mr. Asby the night he was killed?
Yeah, I was straightening up in the chapel.
I heard somebody in here.
I came in to see. It was Mr. Asby, all right.
What was he doing?
Just standing.
And did he have anything with him?
I don't-
Yeah!
I think he did have something with him.
Yeah, I remember. A shopping bag.
Like he had gone to the store and was taking groceries.
Groceries?
That couldn't be, though.
- Why not?
- He didn't have it when he left.
I came out to say goodnight but he had already gone next door...
...to the insurance office.
And he didn't have it with him then.
That's funny.
Nothing in there, Mr. Kelly.
I dust and vacuum these boxes twice every week.
And they're all still here...
...except the one over there that poor Mr. Asby was buried in.
Thank you, Jesse.
Thank you very much.
Stay on their tail.
What the hell do you want?
I thought we was gonna keep in touch.
Didn't you get my message?
I left it on Cal's doorstep.
Yeah.
Where's Arna Asby?
You should've asked that yesterday before Mascola sent her flowers.
I'm asking you now.
Are you gonna protect her or are you gonna hassle her?
You leave that to me.
Now, I know she's here in your pad, and I'm gonna see her.
Open it up.
Be my guest.
Son of a bitch! She'll go to jail for that!
I told you she didn't want to talk.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
That's a very important black lady in there.
You wouldn't want her death on your record.
Especially after protecting her so.
Open this door, Miss Asby!
It's Captain Bollin!
You get away from there!
I don't know who you are!
I'll be back with a warrant and witnesses.
You two better be here!
It's me, baby.
You almost shot a captain.
The man's gonna be back here with a warrant...
...as soon as he can find a judge to sign it.
For me?
No sweat. Gun's registered.
You thought someone was breaking in.
To protect yourself, you picked up the gun and fired a few shots.
But why are they after me?
Nothing personal.
They're after Cal's money and his operation in Queens...
...and anybody who gets in his way including his kid sister and me.
But can't we just let them have it?
You're forgetting the clinic that Cal wanted to build for the kids in Harlem.
The funeral home, the insurance company, it's all good business.
You don't just want to give it away.
When Bollin gets here, that's the captain's name...
...let him in, talk to him, tell him anything you want, but keep him here.
As long as he's here, no one can get to you.
Not now, baby, not now.
Bollin has left his baby-sitters.
What the hell is she doing here?
You sure are a hard man to find!
Too many people looking for me, baby.
Can you drive that thing?
Anything with a stick shift is my meat!
Is that right? How about driving it up a one-way street for me?
All right.
Here's the keys.
Just jump in and start it up.
You left them at the post.
You do that good.
I've been racing since I was 14.
Men or cars?
Baby, keep both hands on the wheel.
Is that snow?
It sure ain't cotton.
What's he doing?
He's digging a grave, Gus.
- Hell of a time! Where've you been?
- Mother Ike's.
Mother Ike's, my ass!
- Mother Ike's, my ass!
- Come on! Come on, I said!
Shithead!
I'll give you "shithead"!
I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Stick with him, do you understand?
We'll be right there.
Get Jack and Al right away.
Jack, get up! Al!
Come on, get your ass up!
Good morning, Mr. Kelly.
What have you got there?
Money.
The money's right there in the box.
I just have to get it out.
Then what, Mr. Kelly?
You'll get what I owe you.
Then it's me and you running the wheel together and everything else.
Go ahead, get it.
Go ahead.
Find it, Mr. Kelly?
Maybe it's in his wallet.
I can't.
Give him a hand.
- Roll it in.
- Come on now!
Roll it in!
Looks like it's payday, Mr. Kelly.
Toss it into the bag. I'll count it later.
That's all of it.
Okay, Kelly.
Come on, Gus. Now wait a minute.
Drop the guns and freeze!
When this starts kicking it won't stop, so nobody get cute!
Who's next?
Move!
Move over there!
Come on, get down here!
All right, let's go!
Get down!
2-4 Whiskey, where the hell are you?
Come in, 2-4 Whiskey, come in!
Careful, Al, the boss is in there!
Harass him, but don't hit him!
I've got to pull out!
Too damn many wires ahead!
Rita, get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Move it! Move it!
Move!
Come on!
We've lost him in the boatyard.
Move! Move it!
Get out of there! Get out!
Get in!
Get up there!
What happened?
The bastard got a boat! Let's go!
Come on! Come on!
We've hit him!
What happened here, Shaft?
Mascola's over there.
Kelly's already at Oakland Cemetery right next to Cal Asby.
And you still got a lot of burying to do.
That's all well and good, but where's the damn money, man?
I don't know.
But I have a feeling it's on it's way back to where it came from. Back to Harlem.
Okay.
Adios.
Adios, mother-
Ripped by thewildbunch22
Easy. Easy. Easy. Hold it.
Hold it. Hold it right there.
Spout it okay?
Okay.
- How far down?
- Just about half.
- Three quarters is enough.
- Okay. Three quarters.
- Almost there?
- It's just about three quarters.
- Let's get her goin'.
- Okay.
Ready to go, Shack.
Goddamn bo.
All right. Bring 'er back.
Come on.
Back, you old bastard.
Come on. Come on.
Hold it!
Now!
Jump him!
- Hey, kids, get that damn chicken!
- Geez!
Get the chicken!
Get it! Grab him!
I'll get it.
Damn!
Get out.
Huh.
Son of a bitch.
- Hey, look. It's the 19.
- Hi, engineer! Hi!
Who are you callin' a fool?
You call me a fool,
I'll push your face in for ya.
Oh, I get a hold of that Shack,
I'm gonna bust his ass bad!
You ain't gonna light up here?
- Well, why not?
- Well, you'll burn us down!
Don't make no difference, kid.
We're gone, no doubt about it.
Ah, it's nothin' but a old pig car.
Uh, pigs eat corn.
This here's hay.
Well, it's nothin' but a old steer car.
Ah, so long, kid.
You croak first,
I'll pray over ya.
Ah, don't pull that crap.
Let me tell you somethin'.
What do you mean, "So long"?
- Well, they'll be loadin' steers in here in a couple of hours.
- Well, what of it?
Steers got horns, kid.
You don't have any.
Ah, they wouldn't do that to us.
- What do you mean, "us"?
- I'll call a cop.
Ninety days on the rocks ain't horns.
It ain't the rocks, kid- not in this part of the country.
And it's not 90 days either.
You're paroled to the bottom of a pit... while the sheriff pockets the two dollars that he's paid every day for your keep.
And that's no ghost story. This country's in the midst of an economic depression.
Two dollars a day is a lot of money.
Even the law is sweatin' hard times.
Country's gone to hell.
Ah, they couldn't get away with it.
Not with old Cigaret, they couldn't.
Old Cigaret?
- You remember Hee-haw Mike, all right.
- Oh, the old-time yegg.
Well, uh, I ain't tryin' to scare ya... but you ain't seen
Mike around, I guess.
- I heard he got his neck broke down in Texas.
- Ya heard right.
You the guy that chilled Mike?
Now ya know me.
How was Texas?
Still there. So's he.
Hee-haw Mike got it in Frisco.
Shot full of holes by nobody knows.
Well, how we gonna get outta here?
Well, don't worry, kid.
I won't leave you to face it alone.
We'll die game, you understand?
Come on. Come on. Hey, hey. Damn.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You Rhode Island Red son of a bitch.
Them horns won't take us alive, kid.
You loony! Geez, you'll get us-
Hey, Captain.
Goddamn!
- Oh, he's gonna be a mean son of a bitch now.
- What was he before?
Get outta here, you.
Jesus Christ.
Close it! And lock it!
Goddamn bo son of a bitch.
- Mr. Logan, number 19's on fire!
- Holy mackerel!
Don't you understand?
The 19 is on fire!
The 19's on fire!
Son of a bitch!
You ain't cuttin' out on me!
Come on. Get some water up there.
Bring some water!
Come on!
- On your feet, bo!
- Oh, hey! Aw, come on, you guys.
- Oh, wait a minute. Hey, wait! Wait!
- Move!
- Oh, wait a minute.
Aw, come on, you guys.
- That oughta keep you!
Yardlet! Yardlet!
Get them fire extinguishers!
Wait! Wait!
Get some water buckets.
Water buckets!
Wait! Wait!
Sand pails! Sand pails!
- I got a train on fire!
- George, get that fire extinguisher! Come on!
Get it next to that oil tank, and the whole yard'll go up!
Holy smokes!
What the hell are ya playin' around for?
Damn!
All right. Brake it!
Slow her down!
Get ready to kick it.
Get some hand pumps.
Hand pumps!
Come on! Come on! Brake it!
- Goddamn y-
- Okay. Stop her.
Come on, Bill. Get out!
Everybody!
- Okay. Kick it.
- Get all the buckets you can.
- Hurry!
- Kick it!
Okay. Hold it.
Come on!
That's straw in that car.
Get that fire out!
Who forgot to grease those journal boxes?
Next time I pick up an empty,
I'm not gonna have it burned...
'cause some damned yardlet forgot to grease the journal box!
Now you clean all those housings.
Oil the bearings, wedges, everything!
You don't ever hand me another fire.
- Th-That's not what happened.
- I don't care!
You never let it happen again.
Never! Say it! lt'll never happen again.
Now you get that engine down to the tower... and you fill it with water, you understand?
Bastard.
I'll fix him, so help me, God!
- Get your goddamn hands off me.
- Wait a minute. Cool off.
We're tryin' to tell you somethin'.
What to you want for Christmas, Leach?
I'll tell you what:
The one thing that's never been done to the Shack-Think, Leach.
A tramp haulin'that son of a bitch offhis high almighty-
- A miserable bastard hobo ridin' his train.
- Ah, it'll never happen.
Maybe it has.
Look. Any you fellas Baptists?
Well, my old man's a Baptist.
I'm tryin' to get home to see him.
He's dyin'.
- You're goin' for a year on the rocks.
- Up yours.
You gonna let that loudmouth talk like that to you?
- Yeah. He's right.
Look here, you little squirt.
- Cut it.
- How'd you make that train?
- Easy. It's like any other.
- Nobody makes that one.
- It's a local. It's nothin'.
- Nineteen ain't just a local.
- Haven't you heard of the Shack?
- The 19 belongs to him.
- So?
So you ain't gonna live through the night.
It was easy. Train come off a curve.
I found a blind.
Well, I just laid down there.
I see the train man, his coattails flyin'.
Of course, I was curious, so I jump on to give the big man a stare in the face.
And you can figure, we didn't gab much.
He's wavin' his hammer and swearin' like a big-ass Baptist... so I just ditched him, settled down in the empty.
Had him beat all to hell too.
Well, this sorry lookin' bo...
come draggin'his ass through the transom, got us both locked in.
So I had to burn my way out.
He's cinders now. That's for sure.
Leach, like I told ya.
You're gonna get a Christmas present in October.
Damn.
Well, we're bettin' on a sure thing.
Let's put it to 'im.
What time does
Shack's train pull out?
- 7:00 in the morning.
- I wouldn't miss this.
I've been waitin' for years.
You ain't alone.
Hey, don't forget Cracker.
He oughta be good for an easy 20.
- You're tellin' me.
- Yes, sir.
It's like money in the bank.
I don't know.
Somethin' ain't right.
Stop worryin'.
You said it yourself.
We're bettin'on a sure thing.
Yeah-like bettin'on yesterday's horse race.
You keep your mouth shut... till we've had our fun and we collected our money.
And you get your ass down to that junction. You tell your bo friends... that we got a new king of the road.
My friends, the most effective means of preventing such evils... in this work relief program... will be the eternal vigilance of the American people themselves.
I call upon my fellow citizens everywhere...
to cooperate with me in making this the most efficient...
and the cleanest example of public enterprise...
the world has ever seen.
- Smile?
- It is time to provide smashing answer...
for those cynical men who say that a democracy...
cannot be honest, cannot be efficient.
If you will help, this can be done.
I therefore hope that you will watch the work in every corner of the nation.
Feel free to criticize.
- Tell me of instances where work can be done better...
or where improper practices prevail.
Neither you nor I want criticism...
conceived in a purely fault-finding or partisan spirit.
But I am jealous of the right of every citizen...
- to call to the attention of his or her government... examples of how the public money can be more effectively spent... for the benefit of the American people.
Never since m-
Smile.
A-1!
I heard ya comin'.
Y-You beat the Shack.
- Rode in on 19, eh?
- Well, that's not exactly it.
Mmm. Say, it figured.
You had to try him sometime.
Twenty miles in an empty stockcar ain't exactly tryin' him.
- That's just coppin' a feel.
- Ah, you're still A-1.
- Ah.
- Wha-
Ohh!
Ho-ho-ho-ho.
It's only a week old.
Ah, ha-ha.
Ah, it's a sweet-thinkin', fast-truckin'man ya are.
Shack hurt ya?
- Never laugh at the devil.
- I ain't laughin'.
Fine.
Well, now- now you beat the Shack... climbed the sky, slept with the stars, why the hell don't ya settle, huh?
Like me. Look.
I talked with F.D. R...
I fought with Pershing, slept with Harlow- tamed tigers, drunk poison... seen the elephant and gone over the falls.
I've been on the road and with it... and haven't moved my ass more than a foot from here in the last year.
- That ain't a question.
- Got an answer.
Oh, I, uh, lost my bindle to a couple of road kids.
Well, shall we go among 'em?
Let's go among them.
Quiet, all right! That's right.
Listen all of you guys.
Come this way!
Gather ye round.
I got the news.
I got the message!
Come on! Open up, you stew bums and alkie stiffs. Get in here.
Open up, ya shovel bums, fakirs, mushers and gray cats.
Ya think you're the road, do ya? Ha-ha.
Well, he's the road.
He's the Emperor of the North Pole.
He came in on a 19!
Come on. Come on.
I saw the Shack throw Casey Shine under the wheels.
I once saw a shovel bum he got close to.
Why he used his hammer or somethin'!
Some say he's finished off 11 boes.
Sixteen.
How close were ya to him?
Close enough to ride.
I got one eye and one question:
Did he use his hammer?
Hmm, the hammer's mostly for show.
Scares some.
It's the hands you gotta watch out for.
And the brain.
No tramp ever rides with the Shack.
It ain't never been done. Never.
- Well, you're lookin' at the man.
- See what we tell ya?
We play it right, we can get a month's pay outta Cracker.
- Well, you better keep this. You're better lookin' than me. - Hey, A-#1.
- Come on over and have some of my mulligan.
- Oh?
- I've been brewin' it for three days.
You never tasted the like.
- Hey, that's a good idea.
- Boiled garbage is all it is.
- You'd do better on a plate ofhot cow chips.
- What do you think it is, your birthday?
- Take it easy, Gink.
- He beat the Shack.
He rode the empty in on the 19.
- Aw, the hell he did.
- Some punk kid beat the Shack.
They got him down at the yard.
- Kid?
- He screwed it up.
- What kid?
No one 'cept A-#1 could take the Shack.
What about it, A-1?
- Careful. He carries a knife.
- You ain't tellin'him nothin'he don't know.
- Son of a bitch is gonna do it.
- He's gonna do it.
Good luck, A-1! Good luck!
- Give 'em somethin' to remember.
- Hey, bo.
Where to?
A-1 to Portland on the 19.
But-
But that's Shack's train.
Mark it.
That's the way, boy-
in great big letters.
Sure sounds pretty fishy to me. l- I just can't believe that.
You mean, you're tryin' to tell me that nobody's ever ridden on Shack's train?
- Nobody.
- Aw, come on.
- I just don't believe nobody.
- Nobody?
- Nobody.
- Aw, somebody.
- Who?
- SkysailJack. He made it.
- Huh! Your butt, he made it.
- Sure, he made it.
- Huh! Ask him.
- What?
Go on. Tell him if Skysail Jack ever rode Shack's rails.
Skysail Jack? In a coffin.
Oh, every train can be beat.
That's all.
No, no. Not Shack's- not these guys.
See, it no more than you can whup
Jack Dempsey.
Somewhere there is a bo than can or has done it.
Oh, yeah?
Well, five says there ain't.
Ten says there is.
Fifty dollars. Match it, or eat it.
You're covered!
Yeah. Well, get to work, you guys.
- Cracker'll want an extra man.
- I got my crew. No students.
Was tryin' to see you don't take on company.
I don't take on company, yardlet- not even you, if you ain't got a ticket.
Who you lookin' at, mister?
I learned my trade on a tough road, and that's a fact.
- You ain't no bo.
- The hell I ain't.
Talk up, boy. Tell him!
- You're a tenderfoot.
- Bullshit! He came in on the 19.
Bought himself a free ride on the special. They saw him get off.
You know what I do to people who say what you've done?
I did it.
I rode your goddamn train.
There's only one bo that's got the stuff to try me.
You ain't even on the list.
Any tramp that sets foot on my train...
I'd hold him out and shake him to death like a snake!
Yeah. I'm onto you, kid.
You're nothin' but a lousy little bum.
I rode your train free, and I wasn't the only one.
Tell me about it!
- Don't matter.
- Oh, it does to me.
Let's you and me take a walk down by the crick- and discuss this, just you and me.
A- #1! A-#1!
His name is on the tower. I seen it.
The gink said he'd come in on the 19.
He's goin'back out in the morning.
Northbound to Portland.
A- #1? Who's A-#1?
Never met him... yet.
- Five dollars he makes it all the way to Portland.
- Five dollars?
What are ya talkin' about, to Portland?
The kid was a fluke.
Now, he was a cinch bet, but no hobo is gonna ride Shack all the way to Portland.
That- It'd take more than a miracle.
A-1 ain't just any bo for five.
- You're covered.
- LetJack hold it.
- Okay. Here.
- Not me. I want no part of it.
- Who's gonna hold the money?
- Okay, okay! I'll handle the money!
Now look. l- I hate Shack as much as any of you guys...
but that bo ain't even gonna make it outta the yards, and here's another five to prove it.
- Five too? Take it.
- And he's got a chance if there's fog.
You're covered.
Put me down for seven bucks.
Tell the telegraph operator to let the boys down the line in on it.
Tell 'em in North Plains what they got comin'.
Tell 'em in Eugene, Albany, Salem.
Tell 'em!
Cottage Grove will cover all bets up to $600...
- on or against A-#1 riding the Shack to Portland.
- Attention, Cottage Grove.
- North Plains bets $85 on the Shack, $ 78 on A-#1. - This is Albany. $ 177 on A-#1.
Attention: Portland advises it's a federal crime...
to use the telegraph line for the purpose of making wagers.
Portland also advises we are betting $255 on the Shack.
Okay, fellas. I got a week's pay on the Shack's big nose.
- A whole week's pay?
- Twenty dollars- any or all of it?
- You got a customer. Remember me?
I'll take half.
- You're covered.
- Hey, don't take all of it. Give me two.
- You got it.
I'll take 75 cents Put me down for 75 cents.
- No trust, Harry. Put up or shut up.
- Give me 50 cents.
You're on.
Well?
The other side. Go on!
Jesus.
- Try the awls.
- A hatpin.
- It's only got two tumblers.
- What do you know about tumblers?
- Come on.
- Gently, gently, gently. That'll do it.
You know, Cracker and that Shack really baitin' the trap today.
Shack'd rather kill a man than give him a free ride.
That's it. Easy, easy.
Goddamn Shack's gonna put this down in his bad-day book.
- He sure is.
- Easy, Smile. It's like a woman.
Opens wide with an easy touch.
There she goes. Ha-ha!
I'm proud of this bastard.
Magic fingers gets you stuff like that.
Shh!
Right. In the trenches. Out of sight.
Come on. Come on.
- Well?
- All set.
- Wish I was goin' with him.
- Me too.
- Almost makes me wanna go back on the road.
- She's a big ride.
Treat her right, bo.
Turn her upside down, says, "made in hell."
You've got your work cut out for ya.
There's a fast mail going through the junction at 7:10.
- That's 11 minutes.
- I'll be there in four.
Three miles?
Not at yard speed you won't.
- I won't be goin' yard speed.
I'm gonna highball.
- Highball?
- The hell you are, Shack.
- I'm not givin' away another free ride.
I can't even see the end of my train in this fog.
I'm gonna have 20 miles an hour under me before he has his first chance.
If he wants to try to deck that, he'll end up sellin' pencils.
This is my yard, and I'll give you the clip on how you go, or I'll telegraph Division.
Well, now, you telegraph Division.
And what are ya gonna say- that you're gonna open up this road to tramps? Ha!
There.
Move.
Here she comes.
Come on, Shack.
We got our money down on ya.
- All the way, Shack. All the way, Shack.
- That's it.
You're a loser, Shack!
A- #1's gonna ride your back all the way!
Forget it, Shack.
A-1 's gonna ride ya all the way!
- That son of a bitch is gonna highball.
- What did you expect?
- Yeah, he's gonna highball in the yard! - Naturally. - But in the yard?
That's great! Faster!
Goddamn you! Faster!
Shack! Shack, she's old.
She oughta be in the shop!
Shack, her cylinder packing's wearin' through!
Shack! Listen, Shack!
Keep it open. Give her steam-all she'll take.
Shack, her side rod's poundin'!
Can't you hear it?
Shack, can't you hear it?
She's bindin'!
- She's gonna bleed!
- I can't hear nothin'!
Now, you keep it open!
You hear me?
You keep it wide open.
She can't take it, Shack.
She can't take it. Shack!
Come on, Shack! A-1 's waitin' for ya.
- Here she comes.
- Get down. Get down.
And there she goes!
Close the throttle!
Shut that throttle!
Lord have mercy!
Holy jumpin'Jesus!
Christ.
Guess who, Shack.
It's the big, bad bo, Shack... and he's gonna bite your big, bad ass!
- That switch is turned.
- Hey, Shack, we spoil your day?
Where the hell is Shack?
Damned if I know.
He's outta sight up-track.
7:02. Eight minutes! Shit.
Shack, you ain't so high and mighty now, are you?
- Doesn't Shack know we're runnin'out of time?
- Boxed in, Hogger-
out of track front and back.
Ain't never heard of such a thing.
Highballin' outta the yards, bustin' through switches. Geez.
Hey, Shack, you left your caboose hangin' out!
I hope you've got your pension paid up, Shack.
Holy shit.
Hey, cover man, now you know what ass-whuppin'is all about.
S-Six m-minutes.
Don't worry, Shack. It ain't so bad.
We'll keep a place for you in thejungle-
six... feet... down!
Hey, back her off!
She ain't clear.
You get a chance, you use this, understand?
Hurry up. Let's get this goddamn thing outta here.
Hey, Shack!
You have as much chance...
as a one-legged man at an ass-kicking contest.
A-#1 ain't any old bo, Shack.
Hey, Shack!
You got a big surprise comin' to you.
We'll save you a place on the bread line, Shack.
Cap', we only got four minutes.
- Take her out- up-track.
- What if we don't make it?
We got no choice.
Two miles back, one mile up. Move it!
- Bye! So long See ya!
- Shack!
Shack! Shack! Shack!
Shack!
Right side! Right side!
Hey! Hey!
Stop the train!
Stop the train!
Hogger, back it up!
Back her up!
Hey, bo! Hey, bo!
Hey, are you listenin'?
In three damn minutes, you're gonna hear a whistle... which'll mean a fast mail comin' down through the junction!
And it'll mean a head-on with 10 people aboard!
Sounds like a ghost story to me.
See you around, Shack.
Come on. Come on.
Get this goddamn train movin'.
All right. Move it!
Come on! Come-
- She's stalling! She's stalling!
- Sand! Sand! Give her sand!
Easy on the throttle, Shack!
Easy on the throttle!
Move! Sand! More sand!
Goddamn you!
Move, you son of a bitch!
Move! Sand! Sand!
Faster!
Faster!
Shovel, you black son of a bitch!
Shovel! Shovel!
- Thejunction! Thejunction!
- Pour it on!
Pour it on! I want speed!
More speed!
Get more coal down!
Jesus!
All right. Move it out!
I said move it! Now!
Sheesh.
- Well?
- I didn't see nothin'.
You didn't see nothin'?
Well, check it again!
Move it! Goddamn!
Goddamn, you one dumb son of a bitch.
You wanna pick one, you got it!
This ain't no game!
Hell, it ain't.
You look like a sore loser to me.
Yeah.
Get grease on that.
Grease from the journal box!
Son of a bitch.
Give me that.
All right. Bring her back.
What about it?
Nothin'so far.
Anything in the empty?
He ain't in here neither.
Are ya lookin'careful?
Sure, I am.
I'm lookin'careful.
Come on back.
I don't know why the captain don't stop messin'around.
He know them boes ain't no account.
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Hold it.
Okay, bring her back.
Well?
- Nothin'.
- You're damn right, nothin'!
You never seen nothin'!
- I did!
- A hat!
- A goddamn hat!
- Comin' off a car goin' fast.
- A rag! Some axle packin'!
- No! Shit!
Goddamn newspaper!
That's what you saw!
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
I don't know.
Somethin' or nothin'?
Which did you see?
Well?
- Nothin'.
- Bullshit, nothin'!
You saw a goddamn hat!
Shithead!
Ow! Ooh! Ah! Ow!
Oh! Oh, Gero-
Like I was tellin' you, there was a day a dump had quality.
But by God, the trash in this country has gone to hell.
You son of a bitch!
Well, I thought we was buddies.
Leave me to get messed up.
On your feet!
- Regular out-and-out?
- Yeah, you'll remember it.
Well, then, I guess the game is up, hmm?
To the finish.
I'll do my share.
Drive away.
You ever ride the Cannonball on the Wabash?
Come up on the C&A from K.C. when there ain't no steps to grab?
Ah, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Listen.
No, wait a minute. Listen.
Let's give 'em somethin' to talk about.
Take the 19 and break Shack's neck.
Hell, who knows this business better than we do?
Look. Why don't you give it up, kid?
Walk on to the next town and buy a ticket out.
Hit the French country-
Montreal.
Why, you rub your stomach up there... and those nuns'll give you a slice of sow belly and a crust of bread.
Even let you sleep with the mules.
I've bummed this country five year.
I got my moniker written on towers from Seattle to Miami.
I been where it's mean, and I want it that way.
You ain't stoppin' at this hotel, kid.
My hotel! The stars at night-
I put 'em there.
And I know the presidents- all of'em- and I go where I damn well please.
Even the chairman of the New York Central can't do it better.
My road, kid! And I don't give lessons, and I don't take partners.
Your ass don't ride this train.
Hey! Ohh! Ow!
Ow!
Bastard.
All right.
Get out of my way, you miserable-
Yeah, that's fine.
Not the gunwales!
Try the roof!
Didn't you hear me, kid?
Yeah, I heard ya.
Don't mean a goddamn thing to me.
Not to old Cigaret, it doesn't.
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ow! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah!
- Give me your hand.
- No.
Come on. Get your hand on the rod here.
Hold on.
Give me your other hand.
Come on. Swing it across.
Come on. Let's go.
Now swing your ass over the rod.
On the rod. Come on.
Now off it. Get up.
Old Hee-haw Mike never taught you to ride down trains, did he?
Come on.
Get your other arm up.
All right. Keep on goin', right up to the roof.
Go on, kid.
Don't stand there.
Keep goin'. Go on.
Ow!
Now, look. If you think I'm-
What the hell are you doin'?
Teachin' you.
Why?
I'm still workin' on that.
Huh?
What the hell's goin'on here?
What are we stopping for?
Everything's okay, folks.
Just stay on the train.
We won't be here long.
All right.
Everybody back in your seats.
Mr. Collard, we've got a schedule to keep.
They greased the rails, the goddamn tramps!
I don't give a damn if they're democrats! Get this moving!
Give her sand.
Get back to your seats there.
We'll be movin'right along.
More sand!
Give her more!
Goddamn tramps!
Look, do exactly what I do.
Nothing more.
Don't like it. Just do it.
Over here. Here.
Come on. Grab on.
Oh, shit!
Don't listen to the wheels, kid... unless you're tied down, and you wanna sleep.
Then when your blood starts to get thick... you edge over and take a look at 'em.
It'll start to flow again.
Sure is nice to be eatin' standin' still.
Yeah, you're right. The way things are these days, it's good to be eatin', period.
Nice sight, huh, kid?
We'll ride that bastard yet.
Oughta keep you alive till we get to Salem.
Here she comes.
Stay back from the train till it stops.
Hurry up, dear.
It only stops for a few minutes.
I'm coming.
Just wanna get a newspaper.
All aboard! All aboard!
Hurry up, dear.
Well?
What's the matter?
Ain't you ever seen nobody shave before?
- All aboard!
- What do you know?
- All aboard!
- Good-bye!
Have a good trip.
Good-bye.
Good-bye. Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
I'm trustin' you, kid.
Cover for me.
Hey, you, come back here!
Let go! Let go of me!
Hey! Stop!
Stop! Stop!
Hey, hey. Come on.
Hey, look who it is!
Goddamn! It's A-1.
- What's he doin' here?
- What's goin' on?
Shh. Quiet.
Stop! It'll be the rock pile for you!
Come back here!
Come on!
In the caboose, kid!
In the caboose!
He must be crazy.
He's gotta be crazy.
I guess he ain't here, all right.
You tell him it's 90 days on the rocks if I get my hands to him! He's sent up!
He's sent up.
- Now, you just give me that!
- Uh-uh. The sale was final.
Well, you can keep the turkey, but I'm takin' the kid in.
Turkey? What turkey?
Who sees a turkey?
Well, this here's a dog.
I'm only doin' what I'm told to do!
You gentlemen ought to understand that!
Look what you've done.
- What have I done?
- Now he thinks he's a turkey.
- Better bark for him.
- What?
Bark for him.
What?
I must have wax in my ears.
Hey, okay.
Hey, a drink for this great lover of dogs. That's all right.
I'm- I'm a man of temperance.
Well, so am I. You could nurse a baby with this stuff, right?
Okay.
Go on. You only live once.
Must be a sign of the times.
The governor in this state can steal, and an honest man can't.
And we get a cop who don't drink.
How'd you come in?
Private compartment of the Great Northern mail.
They was crazy to think they could knock him off.
Ain't no shack alive can take A-1.
No, sir.
- Show 'em their best ain't good enough.
- All right, boys.
How about a little doggie for supper?
I'll get a pot.
I'll get a pot.
Get that fire goin'good.
You look like the president of the railroad, kid.
Why don't you take your hat off?
You come in here like you was a millionaire.
Well, you're not.
You're a casual.
You ain't even seen a first-class hobo yet.
Where you been sleepin'?
Straw stacks and barns.
You've slept out.
Why don't you say so?
- You got any money?
- Couple of pennies.
Willing to be searched?
You're a punk, a deadbeat.
No bum worth a damn is gonna let himself be picked over.
How long you been out?
Thirty days?
Where do you think you're at?
You let some two-bit cop cut you down, and now you're gonna come in here... and figure on cuttin' me and Shack down at the same time?
Damn, boy.
You ain't even ready for a half-grown girl.
One of those New Orleans women get a hold of you, you'd cry for your mama.
But it's plain you've already cried for your mama.
Get your head up!
What have you learned?
Spit it out. How much?
I'm gonna tell you once, never again, so listen tight.
You've got a chance to be a good bum.
You can be a meat eater, kid-
I mean people, not their garbage.
I wanna see you rough as a jungle cat.
Keep on goin' the way you are.
Keep gettin' knocked around... in the same places till the knocks don't hurt anymore.
Then you run with the train.
Remember it.
But don't ever grab unless you're sure you can hold on.
If you ever let go, she'll throw you under.
Want some new togs for the kid?
No.
- How good a thief are you?
- Huh?
Are you any good at stealin'?
Are you any good at stealin'?
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son... that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.
And so I say unto you, do not displease God.
Would he say unto you,
"Well done, thou good and faithful servant,: thou hast been faithful over a few things, and I will make thee ruler over many things"?
No, brothers and sisters.
The master said...
"By thy words thou shall bejustified."
- For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son.
And if it's good enough forJesus, it's good enough for Paul.
It's good enough for you and me, brothers and sisters.
For here I find the door of hope and salvation.
- Do you rejoice in God, sister?
- I rejoice.
Hallelujah, brothers and sisters.
Hallelujah, brothers and sisters.
Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah!
- Oh, hear my prayer,
Blessed Virgin Mother.
Reveal thy wisdom.
- How beautiful is thy revelation.
- Amen.
- Lord, I have sinned.
- Strive for perfection, sister.
Confess your adulterations.
Confess your wanton waywardness.
I confess my sins, O Lord.
Hallelujah, brothers and sisters.
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
You're in God's name...
pure of soul indeed!
Praise the Lord and give me another sinner.
You're next, brother.
You're next, brother.
And Jesus said, "Come unto me, all who are weak and heavy laden."
O Lord, is there truth among us?
Sanctify thy truth.
Have you sinned, brother?
I have sinned.
How, then, can the Lord sanction such neglect?
I will immerse you rather than have you go to the Presbyterians.
Save me from the Presbyterians.
O Lord, give the world to this poor sinner.
- Jesus Christ!
- That's right.
Trust in the Lord, brother.
- I feel his workings within me.
- He is your savior.
Jesus hears you!
Confess, sinner.
Are you resolved to devote your life to Christ and his work?
The Lord is my tabernacle.
And his ship is filled with gold.
Well, set sail for the pearly gates.
- Hallelujah, brother.
- Hallelujah!
Reverend! Reverend!
Reverend!
Some son of a bitch stole our clothes!
After him! After him! Catch him!
Don't let him get away!
Find the thief!
After him!
All right.
Now you listening?
- Are you listening?
- Yeah, I'm listening.
You tighten your belt, turn up your collar, do everything you're told... you can be
Emperor of the North Pole.
You don't, then you are out, O-U-T!
- Emperors know a lot, huh?
- They know plenty, kid.
A-1 knows more.
Let's go.
Come on! Let's go!
It was like that all the way.
He was crazy thinkin' he could take us.
- Thank you, Cracker.
- Shit.
Goin' up against the Shack is like goin' up against Dempsey.
He was lucky the Shack let him live.
Jesus Christ! On the tower!
On the tower!
Takes a lot of guts,
I'll tell ya.
He must be some bo, that A-#1.
He goes all the way to Portland, he makes history.
Okay, I'm givin'odds on the bo.
Eight-to-five, A-#1 makes it.
You're on. Ten bucks.
I suppose you wanna highball.
No, I don't wanna highball.
Regular speed.
Ain't we gonna highball?
No, we ain't gonna highball.
Just regular speed.
Oh.
Just look like you're searchin' the train.
Look like you're searchin' the train.
Do you understand?
Sure. Search the train.
Well, move it!
Aha!
Ah! Hey!
Grab the rope!
Well, grab it!
Cracker!
Cracker!
Goddamn you, you Cracker, son of a bitch!
You stupid idiot!
When I tell you to do-
Useless bastard.
Wait a minute. I'll get some oil.
Wait a minute, Coaly.
Easy now. Easy.
Easy, Coaly. Easy. Easy.
Damn.
What's the matter?
You look broke up to me.
I can fight like a house afire!
I'm ready!
Ya are broke up bad.
You're quittin'!
Drag your ass back to theJesus shouters.
Tell 'em they got a stew bum for the choir.
This bo's headin'out.
He's on his way.
And that ain't just to look around either.
I'm gonna parade.
High mucky-muck of everything.
Tramp royale.
Emperor of the North Pole!
Slashing left and right with my razor.
Puttin'my fist into more faces than you can figure.
Till they so damn played out, they surrender to me... unconditionally, on the spot.
There'll be some stories about me 'fore I'm through.
Ain't a jungle I walk into where they won't know my name.
I'll have kings and queens and royal flushes... and I'll be chief of all!
And nothing's gonna be too good for this big fella.
There's gonna be some bust-in heads.
Hey!
Hey!
I'm talkin' straight.
You better listen.
I ain't stickin'with you anymore.
You ain't good for bummin'.
You ain't mean enough for it.
You can't handle this Shack.
Get off his road!
Easy. Easy. Easy.
Easy now, Coaly. I know it hurts.
Oh, God, it hurts!
It hurts!
Get your ass over here!
Now you get us the hell outta here!
Now!
Oh! Help! Oh!
You son of a-
You bastard.
Got yourself a game leg, huh, kid?
You should've jumped off. That would have been the smart thing to do.
You should've jumped, kid!
I gotta hand it to you, kid.
Yes, sir.
You played both sides against the middle.
Had yourself a high old time while it lasted.
Yeah, but now it's lasted long enough.
Oh, you can keep runnin', kid, but you're runnin'out of train.
And there's no place to hide.
My brakey's cracked his neck, the hide's peelin' off the black... and the Hogger's ready for the loony bin.
And all because of you.
That's a pretty fair day's work for a tenderfoot.
But now I'm gonna show you what happens to people who ride on my train without a ticket.
Too bad you didn't get me too, kid.
Too bad you didn't let that pin bust you up instead of me.
'Cause now I'm gonna spread your ass all over these tracks like manure!
Shack!
Your fight's over here.
Jesus.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Don't belly up on me, bo!
You promised me a fight!
Ghost story, huh?
Smart-ass.
Pick it- Pick it up.
You wanna play?
You wanna play, huh, bo?
Come on.
Smart-ass.
Hey!
Oh, no, you don't, Shack.
Like you said, I promised you a fight.
Now, get your ass up here...
you dirty, miserable, no-good son of a bitch!
Oh, damn.
Hey, bo!
You ain't seen the last of me!
Yes, sir. Gee whiz.
Me and you, if we ain't the team.
Well-Well, we can go to prison and free the cons.
We can capture Mexico.
We can do in Rome as the dagos do.
Knockin' down everything we see, all stuck on ourselves.
Cigaret and A-1.
Yes, sir.
Kid, you got no class.
Stick to barns, kid!
Run like the devil!
Get a tin can and take up moochin'!
Tackle back doors for a nickel!
Tell 'em your story!
Make 'em weep!
You could've been a meat eater, kid!
But you didn't listen to me when I laid it down!
Stay off the tracks!
Forget it!
It's a bum's world for a bum!
You'll never be
Emperor of the North Pole, kid!
You had the juice, kid, but not the heart!
And they both go together!
You're all gab and no feel!
And nobody can teach you that!
Not even A-1!
So stay off the train!
She'll throw you under for sure!
Remember me for that!
So long, kid!
"Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn."
"Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed."
"Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land."
"Let him not breed in great numbers,
"for he will make a desert of his home, and yours."
"Shun him... for he is the harbinger of death."
Nova.
- Where will you go?
- Follow the shoreline.
Don't try to follow us.
I'm pretty handy with this.
Of that I'm sure.
All my life I've awaited your coming and dreaded it.
You're afraid of me and you hate me. Why?
The forbidden zone was once a paradise.
Your breed made a desert of it ages ago.
It still doesn't give me the why.
A planet where apes evolved from men.
There's gotta be an answer.
Don't look for it, Taylor.
You may not like what you find.
Zira. Cornelius. Untie me.
- What will he find out there, Doctor?
- His destiny.
Damn you all to hell!
- Food...
- No. No, no, skipper. It's me again.
Just me.
- Brent...
- Sir?
- Did you contact Earth?
- I tried to, sir. Not a crackle.
Skipper, I took an Earth time reading just before reentry.
What'd you get?
Three thousand, nine hundred and fifty-five.
- AD.
- Almighty God.
Well, we were following
Taylor's trajectory.
Whatever happened to us must have happened to him.
What about us? Where are we?
Well, in my opinion, skipper, we've passed through a Hasslein Curve, a bend in time.
I don't know what planet we're on, but the fact is, we're both of us here, we're breathing, we're conscious, we got plenty of oxygen, water...
Here.
No, we're gonna be all right, skipper.
We're gonna be all right.
As soon as you feel better, we'll run a navigational estimate.
God, if I could only see the sun.
It's up there all right.
You can feel it.
Yes. But which sun?
I don't know. I don't know.
Our computer's shot.
We're lucky to be alive.
Lucky? No.
If it's 3955 AD, I...
Oh, my God. My wife.
My two daughters.
Dead.
Everyone I ever knew.
Everyone.
Who are you? I... Don't be afraid. I just...
Just tell me where I am.
Can you understand me?
My name's Brent.
Brent.
No. No, no, I don't wanna hurt you. I...
I just wanna know where I am.
Where are you from? I mean, your people.
Where are they?
How do I... How do I get to them?
Which way?
Can you... Can you talk?
Right, right. So you can't talk.
What's that?
Taylor!
Where is he?
Taylor. Taylor.
Nova.
Nova. Nova. Come on.
That's the idea. Taylor. Nova. Here.
Taylor. Taylor.
Here. There's a prize.
You go to the head of the class.
Why don't we just settle down and found a colony?
All the kids'll learn to talk.
Sure they will.
Now, where in hell do we go from here?
We might make it yet.
Taylor. Taylor.
Just tell me what happened to him.
Is he hurt? Is he alive? Where is he?
That wasn't here.
A minute ago, that wasn't here.
I'm not the only one. She sees it too.
Listen. Listen, now. If you lose me...
If you lose me, try to find Zira. Remember?
Zira. Go find Zira.
Zira.
This tag. Did he give it to you?
Where did you get this?
Look, is there... is there someone... some other... someone who can talk?
Look, you take me to Taylor.
Taylor.
Taylor. Now. Which way?
My God! It's...
It's a city of apes!
I'll tell you one thing that every good soldier knows.
The only thing that counts in the end is power!
Naked, merciless force!
Members of the Citizens' Council,
I am a simple soldier.
And as a soldier, I see things simply.
I don't say all humans are evil, simply because their skin is white.
No! But our great Lawgiver tells us that never, never will the human have the ape's divine faculty for being able to distinguish between evil and good.
Because the only good human is a dead human!
It's a bloody nightmare.
But those fortunate enough to remain alive will have the privilege of being used by our revered minister of science, the good Dr Zaius.
- Zira, stop. You're in danger.
- So is the future of science, with that rabble-rouser fomenting a senseless military adventure.
The forbidden zone has been closed for centuries, and rightly so.
However, we now have evidence that that vast barren area is inhabited.
By what or by whom, we don't know.
But if they live, and live they do, then they must eat.
Now we must replenish the lands that were ravaged by the humans with new, improved feeding grounds.
And these grounds we can obtain in the once forbidden zone.
It is therefore our holy duty to put our feet upon it, to enter it, to put the marks of our guns and our wheels and our flags upon it!
To expand the boundaries of our ineluctable power!
And to invade! Invade!
Invade! Invade!
- Zira, as your husband, I beg you to stand.
- Only for my principles.
All right. For your principles and mine.
Only please stand.
I gotta get out.
Yeah, I gotta get back up there.
I don't know how, or what with, but I'm not staying here.
Well, General,
I only pray you know what you're doing.
How can you have any doubt, Dr Zaius?
You're aware of the reports we've received of strange manifestations in the forbidden zone.
Manifestations which you, if I might add, as minister of science have been unable to fathom.
Twelve.
Twelve of my finest scouts just disappeared. Vanished into thin air.
Eleven.
Very well, eleven. Eleven.
And the twelfth returned with incredible stories of huge walls of fire, strange, violent earthquakes, his mind gone, shattered no doubt by some un-simian torture.
Well, General,
I still think you're being hasty.
No, Doctor. Decisive.
So we invade, or we stop.
- It's as simple as that.
- And as dangerous.
What is more dangerous than famine, Doctor?
The unknown.
If I had any proper sense of scientific purpose, Cornelius,
I shouldn't cut up the healthy heads of humans.
I should dissect the diseased brains of gorillas to find out what went wrong.
And how would you put it right?
I'd wet-nurse their babies on the milk of chimpanzees.
The milk of kindness.
At least our child when it's born won't be breast-fed on bile.
You know, my dear, the trouble with us intellectuals is that we have responsibilities and no power.
I think I'll make a chocolate icing.
Do you like chocolate?
- What, dear?
- No, no, no. Of course you don't.
- But I do.
- lf we had that power here in our hands, we'd be worse than them.
I don't agree.
Gorillas are cruel because they're stupid.
- All bone and no brain.
- Zira, my dear,
I wish you would not talk like that.
Somebody is liable to hear you.
- Nova!
- What are you doing here?
Taylor?
No, not Taylor. My name's Brent.
- You talked.
- That's impossible.
In a whole lifetime devoted to the scientific study of humans,
I've only found one other who could talk.
- Yes. Taylor.
- Taylor. Is he alive? Have you seen him?
- Where? Where? Tell us.
- Where? Where? I don't know where.
I'm trying to find him.
The longer I stay around here, the less I'm beginning to care.
We loved Taylor.
He was a fine, a unique, specimen.
Why, if it had not been for Zira here, he would still be here, a stuffed specimen in the great hall of the Zaius Museum with his two friends.
With his two friends?
I don't plan to stay here quite that long.
Can you get me some food, some water?
A map, so at least
I'll have some idea where I'm heading?
- You want that taken care of, too.
- I'll get the map.
Now, if you will look up here...
Yes, towards the north.
This was the last place that we saw Taylor and Nova.
- What is that damn stuff?
- You wouldn't know if I told you.
Just relax.
Among other things, I'm a trained vet.
- Great. Go on.
- Taylor was riding with Nova here, between the lake and the sea.
They were heading into the territory we call...
Yes, I know, the forbidden zone.
- Who told you that?
- Your glorious leader back there.
- Zira!
- Quick. Quick.
- Cornelius, open the door.
- Put the things away.
Open it!
Dr Zaius. How nice.
We were just about to have something to eat.
Not until I've talked some sense to that headstrong wife of yours.
- Where is she?
- Good day, Dr Zaius.
Good heavens.
Has there been an accident?
Cornelius hit me.
For my bad behavior at the meeting.
- I don't blame him.
- I don't resent it.
But his nails need clipping.
Enough of this nonsense.
Are you so blind, you two psychologists, that you're unaware that we're on the verge of a grave crisis?
- You heard the Ursus' speech.
- Militaristic tripe!
- Zira!
- Perhaps.
But now he has the incident he requires to go on a rampage of conquest.
- But that is appalling!
- To remain silent while this bully Ursus is permitted to destroy everything in his path is no longer possible.
As minister of science, it is my duty to find out whether some other form of life exists.
- Where are you going?
- Into the forbidden zone, with Ursus.
Another manhunt, Doctor?
Someone, or something, has outwitted the intelligence of the gorillas.
- That shouldn't be difficult.
- Zira.
We apes have learned to live in innocence.
Let no one, be it man or some other creature, dare to contaminate that innocence.
Why, is innocence so evil?
- Ignorance is.
- There is a time for truth.
And the time is always now.
Are you asking me to surrender my principles?
I am asking you to be the guardians of the principles of science during my absence.
I am asking for a truce with your personal convictions in an hour of public danger.
And you shall have it, Dr Zaius, or I shall hit her again.
Let us have no violence, Cornelius.
- Now, I'm relying on you both.
- And we are counting on you too, Doctor.
If I should fail to return from the unknown, the whole future of our civilization may be yours to preserve or destroy.
So think well before you act.
Well, goodbye, Dr Zaius, and good luck.
Now we can finish this up and get you out of here!
Yeah, get me outta here, please!
I've seen the humane way they treat humans here. I don't much care for it.
- Have you a horse?
- Yeah, out in the scrub.
I'd better get you another set of clothes.
The kind fit for humans like yourself.
You'll pass. Get rid of this.
And this too.
If you are caught by the gorillas, you must remember one thing.
- What's that?
- Never to speak.
What the hell would
I have to say to a gorilla?
But you don't understand.
Only apes can speak. Not her, and not you.
If they catch you speaking, they will dissect you, and they will kill you, in that order.
Cornelius is right. Be very careful.
And get out of those things that you're wearing as soon as you can.
Thanks.
- Thank us by finding Taylor.
- Yeah, if he's still alive.
Four.
Seven inches.
Sergeant, wait!
This is a type E cranium. Very unusual.
Weak occipital development, and substandard lobe...
Female. It's been a long time since we've been able to study specimens of such extraordinary clinical interest.
- Bring them inside.
- No!
No, you can't have them.
They are marked for target practice.
Take them away.
- I'll take the key.
- To the target range!
Wait! Wait!
I'd better double-lock the door.
Good luck. All right!
God Almighty!
This used to be my home.
I lived here, worked here.
What happened?
What could have happened?
My God, did we finally do it?
Did we finally really do it?
O God, bless, we pray You, our great army and its supreme commander on the eve of a holy war, undertaken for Your sake.
And grant, in the name of Your prophet, our great Lawgiver, that we, Your chosen servants, created and born in Your divine image, may aspire the more perfectly to that spiritual godliness and bodily beauty which You in Your infinite mercy have thought fit to deny to our brutish enemies!
So be it.
There they go,
Dr Zaius trotting along beside them.
Don't be too hard on the old boy, Zira.
His motives are honest.
He has only one motive, to keep things exactly as they have always been.
I say that it's time for a change.
But Zira, we chimpanzees are too few.
How can we take initiative when they are in control?
Love yes, war no!
- No more lies, no more crud!
- No more guns, no more blood!
Stop! Stop! Stop the war!
- Freedom! Freedom!
- Whoa!
- Freedom!
- Peace!
Peace and freedom!
- Get off the road, young people.
- Freedom!
- We want freedom!
- Get 'em out of the way.
- Wait.
- We want freedom! We want peace!
We don't want martyrs, do we?
We want peace! We want freedom!
- Sergeant? Do it quietly.
- No clubs, no clubs.
We want peace! We want freedom!
Gorilla brutality!
Sergeant!
Are you what we were, before we learned to talk and made a mess of everything?
Did any good ever come from all that talk around all those tables?
- I don't know where they are.
- I wonder where the hell we are.
- We're near the forbidden zone.
- Hell, that's where the army is headed.
- They'll roll over us, blow us to bits.
- Why can't we go back to our outfits?
Because the sarge says to keep lookin' until we find them.
Nova! Nova, Nova, wake up.
We gotta get goin'. Come on.
That hum.
You hear it too?
All right, come on. We're gonna follow it.
Well, whoever, or whatever, something's guiding us.
Whatever they are, they breathe air.
There's an intelligence working here.
That sound is either a warning or a directional device, I don't know which.
It doesn't much matter.
They know we're here.
Put my hands round her throat!
Off!
Hold her throat down until she dies!
No!
Get out!
Get out of my head!
I reveal my inmost self unto my God.
What did you say?
What do you mean, "there's no point"?
Will they hurt her?
No, maybe not physically, but here.
Here. You can hurt here, I know.
Your lips don't move.
But I can hear.
I know. I mean...
I know what you're thinking.
Nothing. I saw nothing.
Who are you?
Brent. Who are you?
I see. "The only reality in the universe."
Well, that's nice to know.
I got here by accident.
How did you get here?
You're wrong.
Why would I want to spy on you?
I'm not even sure you exist.
Of course I know who I am.
I'm an astronaut.
I was sent here on a rescue mission.
To find a fellow astronaut. Taylor.
Well, from this planet, but from another time, 2,000 years ago.
I know. I know it sounds insane.
And it's my insanity.
No. No, I don't know how to get back.
We came through a defect.
A slippage in time.
That's what must have happened to Taylor.
I'm sure he tried to get back.
Yes, my skipper's dead. I'm alone.
Who?
"Nova"? What's that?
Some star or galaxy? What's "Nova"?
All right, all right! Yes, I know her.
I know her!
No, no. She's harmless. Let her alone.
All right.
Just tell me what you want to know.
She helped me. To break out ofApe City.
No, wait. Wait a minute!
Stop it!
I can't understand you if you're all screaming at me at the same time.
I can't separate it!
He's right. He has only limited intelligence.
We should speak aloud, and one at a time.
Are we to understand that you were in the city of the apes?
- Yes. Yes, two days ago.
- What sights did you see?
- You're talking.
- Certainly we can talk.
It's a primitive accomplishment.
We use it when we must.
- When we pray.
- When we sing to our God.
You mean that thing out there?
An atomic bomb?
- Your God?
- You don't understand, Mr Brent.
The Bomb is a holy weapon of peace.
Holy weapon of peace!
Mr Brent, we are a patient people.
But we are determined to know what the apes want. War or peace?
Try to understand.
The only weapons we have are purely illusion.
You just imagine that he hurt you.
Traumatic hypnosis is a weapon of peace.
Like the visual deterrent.
Or the sonic deterrent.
Let me make a last appeal to your reason, before we inflict more of this on you.
These are weapons of peace, Mr Brent.
- Like all our weapons.
- Mere illusions.
Illusions. Damn your hypocrisy!
Is that bomb out there... is that an illusion?
It's operational, isn't it?
The firing mechanism. It's intact, isn't it?
We very much need your help, Mr Brent.
- Why?
- We are the Keepers of the Divine Bomb.
- It is our only reason for survival.
- And yet as you see we are defenseless.
Defenseless against the slobbering, monstrous, materialistic apes.
I'll help nobody.
- Go ahead, annihilate each other.
- I forgive you your language.
There are times, I know, when your sanity is about to give way.
I hope that does not happen.
- I hope you can tell us...
- Exactly what the apes are planning.
We've caught some of their scouts.
They're hideous creatures.
And we've had them here, standing precisely where you are now.
Either their skulls were too thick, or they really knew nothing at all.
Neither do I. Can't you understand that?
I don't know anything.
You make us very sad, Mr Brent.
She can't help you. She can't even talk.
- Don't harm her.
- We never harm anyone, Mr Brent.
You're going to harm her.
- The apes are semiarticulate...
- You're lying.
How do you know?
How do you always know?
Nova.
- Now...
- Tell us of the apes.
The apes are marching on your city.
Bugler, sound the advance.
Ursus!
Ursus, I warned you.
Look what we are faced with!
- I told you you should wait.
- Brutal butchery!
I swear those responsible shall pay with torture and with death!
If you have any pity, get your soldiers to shoot our poor people.
I can't order them to do what the Lawgiver has forbidden.
"Ape shall not kill ape."
Hold your positions!
He bleeds!
The Lawgiver bleeds!
The spirit of the Lawgiver lives.
We are still God's chosen ones.
This is a vision, and it is a lie!
The vision was false!
Bugler, sound the advance.
Advance!
Stupid animals! They don't have the brain to hold our illusions.
- We have no defense.
- Except our Bomb.
- Call our people to High Sanctuary.
- Do you know the range of their city?
- Yes.
- Set in the mechanism and wait for me.
I want a public thought projection, at adult and infant level.
Adults to the cathedral, infants indoors.
Is now and ever shall be
World without end, Amen
The heavens declare the glory of the Bomb and the firmament showeth His handiwork.
His sound has gone out unto all the lands and His light unto the end of the world.
He descendeth from the outermost part of heaven.
Nothing is hid from the heat thereof.
There is neither speech nor language, yet His voice is heard among them.
Praise Him! Praise Him!
My strength, and my redeemer.
Glory be to the Bomb and to the Holy Fallout, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
O mighty and everlasting Bomb, who came down among us to make heaven under earth, lighten our darkness.
O instrument of God, grant us thy peace.
Almighty Bomb
Who destroyed all devils
And created angels
Behold this moment
Behold the truth that abides in us.
Reveal that truth unto that Maker.
- I reveal my inmost self unto my God.
- Unto my God.
All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small
All things wise and wonderful
The good Bomb made us all
He gave us eyes to see with
And lips that we might tell
How great the Bomb Almighty
Who made all things well
Let everyone go to his private shelter.
Empty the streets.
They are to find the City of the Dead.
May the blessing of the Bomb Almighty and the fellowship of the Holy Fallout descend on us all this day, and forevermore.
I trust this simple ceremony convinced you of our peaceable intentions.
- I'd like to thank you for your cooperation.
- When may we hope to be set free?
You may hope whenever you please, Mr Brent.
How could we hope to let you go on the eve of war, Mr Brent?
You know too many of our secrets.
Like your friend.
- Taylor!
- You're... Brent!
- My God! Taylor!
- Brent, how in the hell did you get here?
The same way you did.
Spaceship, Ape City, subway...
- By yourself?
- No. No, Nova found me.
- Is she with you? Where?
- I don't know.
They separated us.
They were trying to make me kill her.
Mr Taylor, Mr Brent.
We are a peaceful people.
We don't kill our enemies, we get our enemies to kill each other.
I'm fighting.
I'm fighting. I don't wanna...
Taylor. Taylor!
Taylor!
Unto God
I reveal my inmost self.
He's hurt bad.
This isn't exactly sterile.
We'll do the best we can.
Taylor. Taylor, they got a bomb.
Atomic bomb.
It's operational. They intend to use it.
- What type is it?
- I don't know.
I don't know what type.
I've never seen it before.
- Well, didn't you see a series number?
- No numbers.
Just some letters on one of the fins.
Greek letters.
Alpha and...
- And omega.
- What?
The Doomsday Bomb.
My God!
What a lovely souvenir from the 20th century.
They weren't satisfied with a bomb that could knock out a city.
They finally built one with a cobalt casing.
All in the sweet name of peace.
Those bloody fools.
They don't know what they've got.
I mean, they pray to the damn thing.
If they shoot it off at some of those apes, it could set off a chain reaction in the whole atmosphere.
Burn the planet to a cinder.
How's that for your ultimate weapon?
This must be what your scout reported.
A subterranean passage.
I think it's worth exploring.
What will you do, Holiness?
Everything necessary.
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- I'm thinking just that.
Nova? Nova, you...
Oh God!
We should let 'em all die.
The gorillas, every damned...
Look what it comes to.
It's time it was finished. Finished.
Taylor.
Come on, come on. The bomb.
Yeah.
Why not?
They're obscene!
Follow me!
Sergeant!
Arrest that creature!
- This is the instrument of my God.
- He can speak!
Your God, eh?
Sergeant.
Your God didn't save you, did he?
Ursus! Ursus, are you mad?
That weapon is built by man.
You can't shoot it down with only a clip of bullets.
If we can't shoot it down, we'll pull it down. Rope!
Block and tackle! Get on it!
But you don't know what you're doing!
It'll kill us all!
I'll find a way to stop it.
Get him! Over there!
Ursus! Someone at the pillar.
Zaius...
- Taylor!
- It's Doomsday.
The end of the world.
- Help me.
- You ask me to help you?
Man is evil, capable of nothing but destruction!
You bloody bastard!
In one of the countless billions of galaxies in the universe lies a medium-size star.
OK, kid, out loud now, so as I can hear what you're sayin'.
I'm checkin' the passengers, getting on and off.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Front and back.
Shuttin' the doors. Rear section first.
Then the front section.
And the doors are closed.
Now I'm checkin' indicator lights to make sure the doors are locked.
I remove my key, go back out the window for a distance of three oar lengths to make sure no one's bein' dragged.
51st Street next stop.
Next stop, 51st Street.
How'd I do?
Now you take my advice, kid.
You serve your six months, and then you put in for the motorman.
Watch it now, we're comin' in.
- 59th Street.
- No, it ain't.
51st Street.
Sorry, this station is 51st Street.
Never say you're sorry, kid.
Someone may come back here and hit you in your damn nose!
Grand Central Station next stop.
Next stop, Grand Central.
If I was you I'd start studyin' for that motorman exam right now.
Tell you the truth, Mr. Mattson,
I have been. Wanna hear some?
Every car in the IRT is 72 feet long.
Costs $150,000, weighs 75,000lbs.
This is where I be getting off.
Hang in there, you're doin' fine.
Yeah, I'll see ya.
Hey, what's the rush, chief?
We ain't gonna leave without ya!
33rd Street next stop.
Next stop is 33rd.
What's wrong, dude?
Ain't you never seen a sunset before?
Hey! How am I supposed to see with you...?
- Holy God! What do you want?
- I'm taking your train.
You're takin' my train?
Hey!
Turn around.
I got s-s-somethin' to show ya.
- What's goin' on?
- Shut up!
I won't tell you again. Open the door or I'll blow your head off.
May I get by, please?
No, you don't wanna go in there.
Suppose I do anyway?
Then I'll shoot your pee-pee off.
Now just go back out the window and tell me what you see.
Someone leanin' against the head car.
The second he comes aboard, you sh-sh-shut the doors.
Keep your hand off the microphone, buddy.
- All right, Mr. Green?
- 100 percent, Mr. Blue.
Get moving, will you?
Oh!
Shelley, give that to the meathead upstairs, will ya?
Right this way.
Just follow me.
Shelley, have you seen
Lieutenant Garber?
Oh! Lieutenant, it's so nice of you to leave your duties long enough to escort our distinguished guests around the facilities.
May I present to you Mr. Yashimura.
Mr. Matsumoto.
Mr. Tomashita.
And Mr. Naka... Nakabashi?
Uh, these gentlemen are all directors of the Tokyo Metropolitan Subway System.
And gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
Lieutenant Zachary Garber of our own New York
Transit Authority Police.
A pleasure, gentlemen.
When you're finished, send them up to 13.
The chairman would like to say goodbye to them personally, OK?
Sayonara!
Follow me, gentlemen. New York City
Subway is the largest in the world, with 237 miles of track, 7,000...
Gentlemen, please. New York City
Subway is the largest in the world.
7,000 cars, 237 miles of track...
- Say "when", Mr. Blue.
- You just keep going, will you?
You're still in switchin'. Why don't you peg it up? You're green all the way.
We're in no hurry.
Your cold sounds pretty bad.
I woke up in the middle of the night with it.
- What happened?
- Must've bucked.
You told me you could drive this thing.
It wasn't me, it's the train.
She bucks all the time. She's a dog.
This is the headquarters of the Transit Police, which occupies the entire second floor of this building.
We call it the nerve center.
Right over here, the status board pinpoints the disposition of every Transit Authority patrolman presently in the field.
That's it. Get a good shot of that.
Things are usually jumpin' pretty good in here.
I suppose you gentlemen have your share of crime in the Tokyo subways, right?
Right? Well, that's the way it goes.
These are the assignment desks. One
- the BMT, the IRT, here's the IND.
There's our artist in residence.
And right through here is our operations lieutenant, Mr. Rico Patrone, who, on weekends, works for the Maia.
Rico, I'd like you to meet some good friends of the chairman.
- Hiya.
- Very good friends, Rico.
Hiya.
Rico, these are the directors of the Tokyo subway.
Why don't you tell these gentlemen about some of the exciting things that have happened in the New York City
Subway System lately, Rico.
Well, we had a bomb scare in the Bronx yesterday.
But it turned out to be a cantaloupe.
I'm busy, Zach, OK?
In the course of a normal work week, the average TA policeman deals with such crimes as robbery, assault, murder, drunkenness, illness, vandalism, mishegaas, abusiveness, sexual molestation, exhibitionism...
- What's your name, motorman?
- Denny Doyle, sir.
- Ever been written up?
- Yes, sir. Once.
- What for?
- Runnin' a red signal. How about you?
Twice. Once on the Canarsie...
That's right, Mr. Green. Tell Mr. Doyle all about yourself, will you?
OK. Stop it about here.
I'm takin' your brake handle and the reverse key, Denny.
I want your cuttin' key also.
That's it.
You'll be hearing from Command Center in a minute or two.
You won't answer, you will ignore the call. Is that clear, Mr. Doyle?
Yes, sir. They can call all they want. I'm deaf.
- Thanks, Mr. Grey.
- Don't mention it, Mr. Green, right?
Right. Let's have your cab key, conductor.
I can't do that.
I ain't supposed to do that.
You got three seconds to live, conductor. One, two...
OK, OK, OK.
It'll mean my job.
What's he gonna do?
You wouldn't want me to spoil the s-s-surprise, would you?
Until then, stay where you are.
Go back to normal speed when...
Command Center callin' Pelham
One Two Three. Come in, please.
Sorry, I couldn't help it.
It was automatic.
Pelham One Two Three, do you read me?
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.
Pelham One Two Three, where the fuck are you?
Hey! What's the goddamn hurry?
I told you, one of my men dropped his wedding ring down the john!
- What are you runnin' for?
- Who's runnin'?
- How come that gate ain't locked?
- Who's gonna steal a subway train?
Grand Central Tower callin' Command Center.
Have you picked up on
Pelham One Two Three yet?
Keep your shirt on.
That's what we're tryin' to find out.
- What'd he say?
- They're backed up all along the line.
Jesus Christ, Caz, you picked a hell of a day to be late!
You wanted a plumber down here, didn't ya?
- Whose goddamn wedding ring was it?
- Mrs. Jenkins'. But, Caz...
Sorry, Mr. Dolowicz.
It just slipped off.
- Why was your hand in the john anyway?
- My hand wasn't...
Go fish it out, would ya?
The toilet's behind the board.
Caz, listen to me! There's a train down!
Classification's been open to a woman for only a month and already we're in a goddamn toilet!
- What the hell's that?
- Marino's been tryin' to tell ya.
He's layin' down between 28th and 23rd.
- What the hell for? How long?
- A couple, three minutes.
Command Center's been tryin' to raise him, but he don't answer his phone.
Jeez, Caz, why don't he answer his radio?
Maybe his radio's busted and the son of a bitch is too lazy to climb down and use the phone.
I'm gonna write him up for this!
I'm gonna have his ass!
Hey, it's movin'.
For Jesus Christ's sake, the dumb bastard is movin' backwards.
Look. He left the front car behind.
The goddamn board must be busted.
He stopped again.
Well, stopped is better than backwards at least.
What was that? I didn't know these things went backwards.
Now you know.
Would you mind tellin' me what you gentlemen are doing?
Yeah, I would.
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.
Come in.
- All right, Mr. Green?
- Smooth as silk, Mr. Blue.
- How do you feel?
- Oh, great.
Get out, Doyle.
Here's your gun. Get going.
We're already two minutes late.
Pelham One Two Three.
Do you hear me, Pelham One Two Three?
Hey, look. The front car's movin'.
And forward this time.
- Yeah, yeah. I've got eyes, haven't I?
- What's goin' on down there?
Are you children with anybody?
You children... you with anybody?
Yeah. My mother.
Go back and join her.
- Why?
- Go back and join your mother.
Mom, we wanna play.
Your attention, please.
Now then, you'll all remain seated.
Anybody who tries to rise is going to get shot.
There's another one!
Shut up!
Move up a bit, Mr. Doyle.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, you see this gun?
It fires 750 rounds of 9-millimeter ammunition per minute.
In other words, if all of you simultaneously were to rush me, not a single one of you would get any closer than you are right now.
- Mom, are those real guns?
- Shh!
I do hope I have made myself understood.
He stopped again. The crazy dumb-ass son of a bitch stopped again.
He's halfway between stations!
What the hell...?
Pure mental case.
I'm gonna nail his pecker to the goddamn wall for this.
- Caz, take it easy, will ya?
- Oh, come on!
If I gotta watch my language because they let a few broads in,
I'm gonna quit!
How can you run a goddamn railroad without swearin'?!
Grand Central Terminal, this is the train master.
Who's in charge down there?
It's for you, Mr. Dolowicz.
It's me, Frank. Caz Dolowicz.
We're watchin' it on the board.
What the hell good is watchin' it?!
I got trains pilin' up behind it!
- Get some supervision down there!
- It's on its way, Frank.
I'll be back.
I've turned off the power.
All right, everybody in this part of the car, move to the back.
Come on. Everybody in the front part of the car move to the back.
- What the hell is goin' on?
- Move back, please, and sit down.
May I say something, please?
You mind letting us know what's happening here?
- Please, listen to me...
- Be quiet and sit down!
- Let's go, honey.
- Don't touch...
All right, Mr. Doyle.
What are you gonna do?
- What about this one?
- Let her sleep.
What you're going to do,
Mr. Doyle, is to go back, collect all the passengers from the cars we've cut loose, and walk them to 28th Street station.
- People hate to get off in a tunnel...
- Just do as you're told.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Can I go with him? I got this very important appointment to see.
Nobody else leaves.
Aw, shit.
I'm sure you wouldn't mind if the children were to go.
Sit down, madam. Didn't you hear what I said? I said nobody else leaves.
Excuse me, mister. Don't you think we should be let in on what's happening?
What's happening, sir, is that you're being held by four very dangerous men armed with machine guns.
Ask a foolish question...
Be quiet.
Be quiet! Nothing will happen as long as you obey my orders.
Shit, man. That's what they said in Vietnam, and I still got my ass shot full of lead.
Shut your mouth, nigger!
- And keep it shut.
- Mr. Grey!
It's terrible.
Who asked you to look?
All right, Mr. Green?
The power's off from 14th Street to 33rd.
All four tracks. Local and express.
The north and the southbound.
Why am I still seeing lights?
That's emergency.
They run on AC like the signals.
- Stop that, will you?
- Sorry.
- Leave the door open.
- Command Center calling Pelham.
Did you cut off the power down there?
Without callin' to explain?
Huh? Now you listen to me.
Cut this out and answer me.
You're screwing up the whole
New York City subway system.
Gentlemen, this is the TA Command Center, come on in.
A lot of laughs in here. Terrific place.
You see, each train is identified by the name of its terminus and the time of its departure.
Thus an express train leavin' Woodlawn at 6:30 p.m. would be Woodlawn 6-3-0.
While on its return trip its destination might be, uh... let's say, like, Flatbush 8-2-5.
I hope you're memorizin' all this junk.
I'm gonna ask questions later.
Garber, what's the matter with you?
Don't worry. They don't understand a word of English.
This way, dummies.
Step this way, dummies.
Over here is Frank Correll, the Lord Byron of the New York City Subway System.
Observe the way fire and smoke shoot out of his ears.
Don't bug me, Garber.
I got troubles here.
What's the matter?
A train is down, its radio's dead, the power's off, and it's dumped its load.
Aside from that, everything's ginger-peachy.
What time is it, Mr. Green?
Uh...
Right. Time to talk to them.
- Ls something troubling you?
- I think I'm gonna die today.
That's entirely possible.
This is Pelham One Two Three to Command Center.
This is Pelham One Two Three to
Command Center. Do you read me?
OK, we'll leave him alone to his problems.
Where have you been?
What are you tryin' to do?
Screw up this entire railroad single-handedly?
I want an explanation and it better be good!
Your train has been taken.
- What?
- Repeat, your train has been taken.
Hey, shut up in here! Shut up!
I said shut it, everybody!
Shut it up, everybody, goddamnit!
What do you mean the train has been taken?
- Are you the motorman?
- Negative.
Nobody's authorized to be in that cab except the motorman. Identify yourself.
Listen, Train Master,
Your locomotive has been hijacked by a group of heavily armed men.
It what?
We are holding 17 passengers and the conductor hostage in the first car.
I am quite prepared to kill any or all of them if you do not obey my commands to the letter.
- Have I made myself quite clear?
- You're outta your skull!
Be that as it may, get out a pen, take down our fist of demands.
Hey, now wait a minute.
Hold on. Stand by.
Why would anybody hijack a goddamn subway train?
Hit your six button, Frank.
I want the TA police in on this.
What are all these Chinamen doin' in here?
Holy Christ, I forgot.
Charlie, take these monkeys up to 13.
It is all right, Lieutenant Garber.
I am sure we can find it by ourselves.
And thank you for a most instructive visit, Lieutenant.
A most exciting tour, Lieutenant.
Most exciting.
Most exciting.
Garber to Patrone. Garber to Patrone.
Come in, Patrone.
This is Patrone.
Rico, I want you to plug everythin' you got into the IRT train master's circuit.
And all units stand by on the double.
Call in the City cops. Put it on a 911 so their computer gets it.
What's up, Z?
- You won't believe it.
- I'll believe anythin'.
A train's been hijacked.
I don't believe it.
When did the power go?
- Hey! Conductor, when did the power go?
- Who wants to know?
Me! The supervisor of the Grand
Central Tower wants to know!
Oh, yes, sir! A couple of minutes ago!
Hey, what happened down there?
Who wants to know!
No, nobody's hurt!
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know what's goin' on!
- What happened?
- Nothin' happened, lady.
- Was anybody killed?
- Nobody's killed.
On the left now, watch out for the third rail. On the left now.
What the hell is this, for Christ's sake?
Your attention, please, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm sure the more intelligent of you have worked out you're all hostages.
Oh, my God!
Isn't that wonderful.
- Hostages.
- What did you think? Guests?
When we get what we want, you'll be released unharmed.
Until then, you'll continue to do precisely as you're told.
Excuse me, sir. What's going to happen to us if you don't get what you want?
Excuse me, sir. We are going to get what we want.
I don't give a damn what they were armed with.
They were gonna kill me!
You're like the captain of the ship!
You're supposed to go down with it!
- Horseshit!
- Oh, lady, butt out!
Tell Command Center
I'll be on my way to investigate!
I wouldn't go down there if I was you!
I know you wouldn't!
You work for the subway, mister?
Tell 'em I'm gonna sue!
I'm gonna sue their ass off!
Pelham One Two Three to Command Center.
Do you read me? Are you ready to take down our list of demands?
I'm listening, you animal.
What do you want?
- Do you have your pen?
- Go on, for Pete's sake!
It's important you understand three things.
One, Pelham One Two Three is completely within our control.
Two, we are all armed with automatic weapons.
Three, we have no scruples whatsoever about killing.
- Do you understand me so far?
- I understand you tine, you lunatic.
You'll never get away with this.
Inform the mayor that we demand one million dollars cash for the release of the car and all the hostages.
- That'll be the day.
- The time is now 2:13.
The money must be in our hands not later than 3:13.
One hour from now.
If the money is not in our hands, we'll kill one hostage for every minute you're late.
Keep dreamin', maniac.
If anybody attempts to interfere
- anyone, in any way - we will begin killing the hostages immediately.
Confirm, please.
Zach! Zach!
- Pelham One Two Three, come in, please.
- This is Pelham.
Identify yourself, please.
This is Lieutenant Zachary Garber of the Transit Police.
Identify yourself, please.
I'm the man who stole your train.
Sir, there is no way you can get away with this.
You are underground in a tunnel.
Why do you concern yourself with that?
At precisely 3:13 we are going to begin executing the hostages.
You'd better get in touch with the mayor and get back to me for my further instructions.
Over and out.
Son of a bitch has got me backed up all the way to the Bronx!
What is this, a circus?
Let's get back to work!
Rico, did you get that?
I only got your end of it, but I could piece it together. It's crazy.
The guy's got a heavy English accent.
He could be a fruitcake.
We got anybody at 28th Street?
Just checkin' it out.
Yeah, he's around there somewhere.
Tell him to hold the fort. Could be all day before the City cops show up.
They're never around when you need 'em.
Lex 28. Lex 28.
Come in, please.
Patrolman James.
This is Lieutenant Patrone.
Where are you?
28th Street, southbound.
Look, Lieutenant, everything's cooled out.
I mean nothing's happening.
What's goin' on?
Look, don't react to this, but a train's been hijacked.
- Holy shit.
- For God's sake, don't say anything.
Oh, there's a supervisor from Grand Central Tower missing.
Yeah, I saw him a few minutes ago.
He went down the track on foot.
Look, you better go after him.
See if you can turn him back.
Yes, sir.
All I know is I am the goddamn mayor of the goddamn city of New York, the second most important elective office in the entire country, and you tell me
I gotta lay here and suffer like every other schlub in the country?
I'm sorry you have the flu, Mr. Mayor.
There's nothing more I can do.
There's one more thing. Get out!
You can't fight City Hall.
Couple number two,
Arthur and Eleanor you have 20 points.
...correctly and you'll move into first place.
Yeah?
Al, it's Warren.
I'm comin' upstairs.
I got a real bitch on our hands.
Don't tell me. I don't wanna know.
- I'm comin' up.
- Can't you handle it, Warren?
You are the goddamn deputy mayor of the city of...
Sure I can handle it. Like I handle every other fifth y, stinkin' job in this whole miserable city, but I'm not gonna do it.
What is it? Another strike?
All right, all right.
I can take another strike.
A gang of men has hijacked a subway train.
A gang of men...'?
Has hijacked a subway train.
They want a million dollars for it.
Come on up.
Couple number one are the winners of today's Newlywed Game!
Missed it!
What do you want, Mr. Green?
Is everythin' OK?
Go and sit down. I do not want Mr. Grey and Mr. Brown alone with the passengers.
- Don't you trust them?
- I trust Mr. Brown.
I do not trust Mr. Grey.
I think that Mr. Grey is an enormous arrogant pain in the arse who could turn out to be trouble.
I also think that he is mad.
Why do you think they threw him out of the Mafia?
Ohh, terrific.
Hold it right there, cowboy!
Who are you?!
You'll find out if you take another step!
I'm warnin' ya, mister! That's City property you're foolin' around with!
That's just too fuckin' bad!
Why don't you go grab a goddamn aeroplane like everybody else?
'Cause we're afraid of flyin'!
Clear out or I'll shoot your ass off!
The hell with you! I'm comin' on board!
I warned you, stupid!
Holy shit.
I warned the bastard, but he kept on comin' anyway.
- Was he alone?
- I didn't see nobody else.
Mr. Brown.
I guess I got us on the scoreboard, right?
Take over from Mr. Grey.
- A little quick with that gun.
- The jerk was comin' on board!
Loved every minute of it.
- Keep those children quiet.
- I'm trying! I can't!
- Do you want me to try?
- Oh, my God! No!
You said nobody was gonna get hurt.
Patrolman James callin' Operations.
This is Patrone.
Did you find that supervisor?
Shh!
- He's dead, Lieutenant.
- Speak up, will ya? I can't hear ya.
I can't. I'm only 20 yards away from the hijacked train.
They just shot him with a machine gun.
Is he dead?
- Wouldn't you be, Lieutenant?
- Stay put and keep an eye on things.
Z! They just drew first blood.
That supervisor from Grand Central
Tower. They just killed him.
Oh, my God. Thanks, Rico.
Frank, do you know who went to 28th from Grand Central?
- Yeah, Caz Dolowicz. Why?
- Jeez. I knew him.
Hey, whaddaya mean, you knew him?
They just shot him.
Dead?
- Caz? Fat Caz?
- Yeah.
- Garber?
- Aw, shit!
Garber? Are you there, Zach?
- Yeah, who is this?
- Costello.
Yes, Captain.
I'm puttin' you in charge at this end.
I'm goin' to headquarters.
If I don't show up, the city cops'll hog all the action.
There 's one on board the train.
One of the hostages.
You're kiddin'. There's a cop on the train? How do you know?
There were two, but one got off at 33rd and called in later when the news got out.
That means the other one's still on the train.
- Plainclothes?
- Yeah, Tactical Force.
- Man or woman?
- I never even thought to ask.
Well, doesn't make any difference.
Whoever it is can't do very much single-handed.
Warren, I thought it over.
I know what we're gonna do.
Tell me.
We're gonna let 'em keep the goddamn subway train.
We got plenty of them.
We'll never even miss it.
How about the 18 hostages?
We gonna miss them?
Warren, goddamnit!
This city hasn't got a million dollars!
Empty one of your Swiss bank accounts, because there's no other way out.
- Don't we get to think about it?
- There's no time.
I still want the full picture.
Get me the police commissioner, the chairman of the Transit Authority, and that putz we got for a comptroller.
They're on their way, but it's no good runnin' to them, AI.
You're the mayor.
The buck stops with you.
- Oh, shit.
- God help us.
Shit! Piss! Fuck!
Call Charlie. Tell him
I'll get to him as soon as I can.
Where's that list on 144?
Command Center callin'
Pelham One Two Three.
Hey Frank, you're hoggin' my circuits.
What do you want from me? I got motormen callin' me from all over!
Tell 'em to get off the air.
I need some more lines open here.
So talkin' to murderers takes priority over runnin' a railroad?
Get off it. My only priority is savin' the lives of these passengers.
Screw the passengers! What do they expect for 35 cents? To live forever?
Oh, you're beautiful.
- Do you read me, Pelham?
- I'd go in with guns and blast 'em out!
Why don't you start doin' your own work and let the police do theirs, huh?
Like that cop on the train.
When's he gonna start shootin'?
We don't know if it is a "he“.
- Do you read me, Pelham?
- Women cops! What good are they?
Probably can't find her gun in her goddamn purse!
Pelham One Two Three.
Any news to report?
What's that about news?
Say again about news.
I said have you any news to report?
No, nothin' yet.
Gesundheit!
- What are you calling about?
- Pelham, we need more time.
Shut the door, please.
It is 2:24, Lieutenant.
You've got 49 minutes left.
Be reasonable, will ya?
We're tryin' to cooperate, but we can't do anything if you don't give us enough time to work with.
49 minutes.
We're dealin' with City Hall. You know what a mess of red tape that is?
49 minutes.
Look, fella, we know how to tell time as well as you do, but we aren't gonna get any place if all you do is repeat "49 minutes!"
48 minutes.
Yeah, all right, all right.
We'll get back to you as soon as we can.
To hear you plead with that chickenshit makes me ashamed to be an American!
Go play with your trains.
Stay tuned for an update on the subway hijacking case.
Get me the borough commander.
- Turn off that goddamn music.
- Yes, sir.
Harry? I'm headin' up to see the mayor.
What's it look like down there?
It's murder, Phil, as usual.
They really smell blood on this one.
- Who's your number two?
- Deputy Chief Inspector Daniels.
He's a good man, Phil.
He handled that protest last month.
- Get those photographers outta here!
- How are you deployed?
Fifty men inside the tunnel, north and south of the train, well concealed, all wearing vests and armed with machine guns, shotguns, handguns, riot guns and a half-dozen snipers with night scopes.
We could Tight the Third World War down there!
Make sure they stay outta sight.
If the hijackers see 'em, we'll have a massacre.
We have a sniper's report that they're movin' around pretty freely.
The one in the motorman's cab is an easy shot.
Absolutely no! Understand? We're takin' the threat seriously! What's upstairs?
Trucks, cars, emergency medical and rescue units. The works, Phil.
Harry... tell me somethin', will ya?
They're in a tunnel, surrounded on all sides. How do they expect to get away?
Beats the shit out of me, Phil.
Oh, AI, it's disgustinig.
Would you stop it with the tissue?
Warren, tell him that other mayors have to live in this house after we're gone.
Go on in there, AI, and I'll send everybody in. Just sit down.
Thanks for comin' up on such short notice, fellas.
You all know Jessie, don't you?
Good, Phil, just in time.
A little coffee? Some cake?
Better skip it, Jessie.
We're short on time.
We know what's goin' on underground.
The issue is whether or not we pay the ransom.
Phil? Whaddaya think?
Well, we're fully mobilized. There's enough firepower to wipe out an army.
But... I can't guarantee the safety of the hostages.
In other words, you're for payin' the ransom.
Well, we don't want another Attica, do we?
- So your vote is?
- I abstain.
Shit. Barney?
The safety of the passengers is the only concern of the Transit Authority.
- Your vote?
- Pay the two dollars.
If it was two dollars,
I'd pay the two dollars, Barney!
It's a million! A one with six zeros!
Is it comin' outta your pocket?
Come on, will ya save the poor mouth for later? How do you vote?
- I'm not through discussin' it yet.
- Yes, you are. Now vote.
My concern is with the taxpayers.
I always say millions for defense but not one cent for tribute.
- Isn't that what I always say?
- Uh-huh. So that's a “no...
All right, AI. You've heard from the Three Wise Men.
- Now what do you say?
- What are they goin' to say, Warren?
- They who?
- Who? Everybody!
- The press! The man on the street!
- He means the voters.
You know what they'll say.
The Times will support you,
The News will knock you.
The Post will take both sides at the same time.
The rich'll support you.
Likewise the blacks.
The Puerto Ricans won't give a shit.
So quit stalling.
Stop bullyin' everybody, Warren!
This is supposed to be a democracy!
Wise up, for Christ sake!
We're tryin' to run a city, not a goddamn democracy!
Al, quit fartin' around!
We've gotta pay!
- Jessie?
- Hmm?
Jessie, what do you say?
A million dollars sounds like a lot of money.
But just think what you're gonna get in return.
- What?
- 18 sure votes.
All right. All right. Warren?
- Warren, arrange for the payoff.
- Hallelujah.
You heard him. Phil, pass the word to the bad guys that we're coughing up.
- What bank do we do business with?
- City National Trust. I'll call.
I'll call. You'll take an hour tryin' to knock down the interest rate.
Jessie?
I think I handled it all right.
A regular Fiorello La Guardia.
Patrolman James callin' Operations.
This is Patrone.
What's going on?
There's a lot of feet movin' around out here in the dark.
I figure it's a couple of dozen sharpshooters and snipers.
- Am I right?
- L wouldn't be surprised.
Make sure they know I'm standin' here between them and the hijackers.
I'm not all that easy to see in the dark.
Nothing yet?
Boy! They're sure takin' their time, aren't they?
Don't worry. They're gonna have to pay.
Suppose they don't?
Well, then a lot of people are gonna die, aren't they?
Including us.
Better than selling life insurance, isn't it?
Life insurance? You told me you were in the army.
I was. That's where I developed my expensive tastes.
British army. $150 a month.
You gotta be kiddin'.
The Africans paid me 5,000.
- A month?
- For leading a battalion.
Jesus! What the hell did you get outta that for?
Because the market dried up.
Wow!
At least you weren't fired.
But I don't give a shit.
What guy wants to drive a subway train for the rest of his life?
What did they catch you doing?
N... Nothin'.
I mean, they framed me.
They needed a fall guy.
Transit cops. Undercover guys.
They got wind of a gang passin' dope.
Transporting from downtown to uptown, and givin' it to a motorman.
They tried to pin the evidence on me, but they didn't find a thing.
You were innocent?
Of course I was innocent.
You think I'd do a thing like that?
I'm on my way to headquarters.
We got the green light.
Green light? That's great news.
The men are rarin' to go.
No! We're paying 'em the ransom money.
Pass the word along to the hijackers.
Roger.
Borough Command to the 28th Street platform. Come in, Daniels.
- Daniels, do you read me?
- This is Daniels.
The mayor's agreed to pay.
Let the hijackers know right away.
Roger.
Command Center, this is 28th Street.
Do you read me, Command Center?
- This is Command Center. Who is this?
- Chief Inspector Daniels.
The mayor's agreed to pay.
Pass it on to the hijackers right away.
Will do, sir.
Pelham One Two Three.
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.
This is Pelham One Two Three.
I read you.
We agree to pay the ransom.
Repeat, we agree to pay...
What? They're gonna do what?
Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three?
- Zach, you're outta your skull.
- Hey, will ya?
I read you, Garber.
Take down my next instructions, to be followed to the letter.
The money's to be paid in the following denominations:
500,000 dollars in Fifties.
500,000 dollars in hundreds. Right?
500,000 in fifties. 500,000 in hundreds.
Which will be put in stacks of 200 bills each, bound with two thick elastic bands.
Two stacks of bills, bound in what?
Bound with thick elastic bands.
All of the bills will be old bills, their serial numbers to be random.
Now that's all.
When the delivery arrives we'll contact you with further instructions.
- About what? Your getaway?
- Signing off now.
Son of a bitch!
Hey, Pelham.
It might interest you to know
I figured out how you're gonna do it.
Yes, it would interest me very much.
You're gonna make every man, woman and child in New York City close their eyes and count to a hundred, right?
It is now 2:47. That means you have got 26 minutes...
Hey, wait a minute, pal. We agreed to pay the money. Turn your clock off!
- 26 minutes.
- Your instructions were complicated.
The money has to be counted, stacked, tied, transported.
It isn't physically possible.
You'd be surprised what's physically possible.
The clock's running.
26 minutes. After that, we scratch 'em off one per minute.
Your attention, please!
Ladies and gentlemen, it might interest you to know the city of New York has agreed to pay for your release.
As soon as the money gets here, will you let us go?
Soon after.
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind telling us how much you're getting?
Why is that of interest to you, sir?
Well, a person likes to know his worth.
- One million dollars.
- That's not so terrific.
Pull your pants up, AI.
We're goin' downtown.
Totally out of the question, Mr. LaSalle.
Nobody asked you.
Warren, for Pete's sake,
I'm sick as a goat. What's the point?
The point, for Pete's sake, is that the mayor of the city of New York, trailing by 22 points in all the polls, cares enough about
18 citizens in jeopardy to make a personal appearance in their behalf.
You know what'll happen?
What always happens. I'll get booed.
- He's a very sick man.
- Will you let go of that!
All you have to do is say a few words to the hijackers over a bullhorn.
You make a dignified plea for mercy.
Warren, suppose the hijackers start shootin' at me?
Will you stop!
They have no reason to shoot at you.
Why? Do you think they're from outta town?
Get dressed, Al. I'll do the jokes.
Hold your water, will ya?
All right, shut up and I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now listen.
I want all trains...
Garber. Come in, Garber.
Come in, Garber.
- Who are we waitin' for, Z?
- Beats me.
How long's it take to get all that money together?
We'll never make it.
The passengers are dead ducks.
- I wonder what that cop's thinkin'.
- What cop?
The one who's a hostage.
Shit, I'm glad it's not me.
- Where's that money?
- Wanna make yourself useful?
Get Personnel to get a list of all motormen discharged for cause during the past ten years.
- What are you lookin' for?
- Somebody down there can drive a train.
You don't pick that up watching Sesame Street.
Tell 'em you want it today.
Mr. Grey, can I have a word with you, please?
Will you stop messing around with that girl, Mr. Grey?
What are you talking about?
She's a 20-buck-a-trick hooker.
- Who's a 20-buck-a-trick hooker?
- Leave her alone.
Who are you to go around callin' people "hooker?"
I can do this job and hump that broad at the same time.
Listen, you little prick! 20 bucks wouldn't buy you a good-night kiss!
I'm giving you an order, Mr. Grey.
Blow it outta your ass,
Colonel.
You're talkin' to the wrong man.
I'm not your Mr. B-B-B-Brown.
I once had a man shot for talking to me like that.
Well, that's the difference between us.
I've always done my own killin'.
Sure takin' a hell of a long time in there.
It's a lot of money, Albert.
Think how many times you gotta wet your thumb to count a million bucks.
Command Center calling 28th Street.
Come in, Inspector.
This is Daniels.
- Has the money left yet, Inspector?
- Not yet.
What are they waitin' for? For God's sake, give 'em a goose, will ya?
We're runnin' outta time!
We're runnin' outta time!
Pelham, this is Command Center.
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.
- This is Pelham One Two Three.
- This is Garber.
We're movin' a little slowly at this end, Pelham.
We need some more time.
Sorry, no more time.
If you can just see your way...
- Will you hold it down, Frank?
- I want a local sent around the loop at South Ferry and shot up the west side...
I said knock it off!
I'm tryin' to buy some time here!
And I'm tryin' to run a railroad!
While you're playing grab-ass with a bunch of friggin' pirates!
How about 15 more minutes, Pelham?
A lousy 15 minutes?
Negative.
Ten minutes, then. What difference can ten minutes make to you?
Negative.
- Anythin' wrong?
- Wanted more time.
- How much more?
- Just ten minutes.
- Guess that can't hurt anybody.
- I didn't give it to them.
- Suppose they can't make it?
- Then we do what we said we'd do.
Maybe an hour isn't enough time.
You know the system.
You give 'em an hour, they take an hour.
Give 'em two hours, they take two hours.
An hour is plenty of time, Mr. Green.
Yeah, but supposin' it isn't?
This is the borough commander.
Come in, Headquarters Charlie!
Aren't you guys movin' yet?
Do you know what the damn time is?
We're still waitin' for the money, sir.
I'm warning you guys. If I don't see your faces before the deadline,
- I don't wanna see them at all! Ever!
- Yes, sir.
I told you. It's gonna be our ass.
- This is a million dollars?
- It's what it buys. Not what it weighs.
Eight minutes. We're not gonna make it.
- Inspector, where are they now, please?
- Center Street, just north of Chambers.
That gives us seven minutes.
Not enough time, sir.
Even if they get to 28th Street on time, we still gotta carry it down track on foot.
No way, sir.
I always wanted to do this.
Look, we're scarin' the shit outta everybody.
Yeah, includin' me.
Pelham One Two Three, this is Garber.
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.
All right, Garber, this is Pelham One Two Three.
The money's en route, makin' pretty good time too, but it won't get to you by 3:13.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
Suppose we get it to the entrance by then.
Will you change your deadline from delivery to you to arrival at 28th Street?
Would you do that at least? Do you read me, Pelham, for cryin' out loud?
All right, Garber.
But no more concessions.
- Is that quite clear?
- Quite clear. Quite clear.
They bought it. If we get the money to the station by 3:13 we'll be OK.
Good work, Garber.
Headquarters Charlie, headin' north on Center Street...
Keep it comin'.
You've got four minutes!
Yes, sir, we'll make it...
We'll never make it.
Sir, the mayor is on his way down.
Terrific. We'll hold the crowd till he gets here.
Mr. Green.
Yes.
Coming up in one minute.
Have you decided which one it's gonna be?
Does that make any difference?
I guess not.
OK. 50 seconds and then
I'm gonna eliminate one.
Hello, Headquarters Charlie, we're approaching Astor Place.
You've still got 28 blocks!
Floor the son of a bitch!
Look out!
Whaddaya mean, it's been wrecked?
We're outta time!
I know we're outta time.
Couldn't make it, that's all.
That's all? They're about to shoot an innocent person!
If they know the truck is wrecked, how can they expect us to be on time?
They don't know anythin' down there.
How can they know anything...
Holy mackerel, that's it.
Pelham One Two Three, the money has arrived. Repeat, the money has arrived.
Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three?
The money has arrived.
This is Pelham One Two Three.
You made it just in time, didn't you?
Get it up there! Move!
I hope it works.
Are you still there, Garber?
Still here. Tell me something, Pelham.
If we were a couple of seconds late, you would've knocked off an innocent party?
Affirmative. Now I'll give you the instructions for the delivery of the money.
As usual, you'll follow them to the letter OK?
I got it. Go ahead.
Two unarmed policemen...
Gesundheit.
Two unarmed policemen will walk down the track.
One with the money, the other with a torch, which he will flash continuously from side to side.
When they reach the can the rear door will be opened and the one with the money will throw it onto the train.
Then they will both turn and walk back to 28th Street station. Acknowledge.
- I got it. Is that all?
- That's all for now.
But keep in mind, won't you, that the same ground rules apply.
Any wrong move by anyone and I kill a hostage.
Coulda guessed that part.
You have got five minutes to deliver this money.
You don't think you're gonna get out, do ya?
It's now 3:14.
You've got till 3:19.
Over.
Over. Bastard.
Well, it's about fuckin' time!
You two! Get the money outta there!
Which one has the flashlight?
Then you carry the money.
Gimme that paper.
You've got four minutes!
Never mind the goddamn salutes!
Just get goin'!
Jesus, it's the goddamn mayor.
- You get the feelin' we ain't alone?
- Whaddaya mean?
We got four sub-machine-guns in front of us, and all these jokers behind us.
I feel like I'm walkin' into the fuckin' OK Corral.
Pow!
Shit!
Hold your fire, goddamnit!
Quiet!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. It's not too b-b-bad.
- I think it went right through.
- Move back, come on. Move back.
Hey! Give me that scarf.
Give me that scarf!
Keep quiet!
- OK?
- Yeah. I don't feel p-pain too much.
- How many shots?
- Just one.
The rest was me and then they answered.
I didn't see anybody, I just got mad.
Goddamnit!
Mr. Grey?
You don't think they're finished out there, do ya?
Go back there and help Mr. Green, will you, please?
Some girl-scout chickenshit outfit I'm in, here.
I suppose somebody out there got nervous or bored.
Been there a long time.
Can't afford to let it pass.
Who started it?
Who Fred first? Them or us?
I don't know, Lieutenant. It came from somewhere behind me in the dark.
It had to be one of the snipers.
Somebody just took it in his head to fire on his own?
- How could he do such a thing?
- Easy, Lieutenant.
Real easy.
Can you see what's goin' on inside the train?
No, not too good. I'd sure hate to be in there findin' out.
Conductor.
- You mean me?
- Yes. Stand up and come down here.
- Why, what are you gonna do?
- Something you can help me with.
- Come on. Come down here.
- Look, if he doesn't wanna go...
All right, everybody. Just get back on your seats. Very quietly.
Come on. Back on your seats.
All right, conductor. I want you to walk up track about a hundred feet.
Just wait for the men delivering the money, all right?
I'll open the door for you.
- Why do I have to go?
- Come on, come on.
Here, I'll help you down.
Come on. Please go.
There's nothing to worry about.
Look! Somebody's climbin' down!
Christ, he's comin' this way!
Oh, no!
What?
What are you talking about, Rico?
Why would they shoot a hostage?
We're still under the deadline.
- Somebody threw a shot at them.
- Who the hell was it?
Nobody knows. My bet is we never will.
Z, when are we gonna hear from that cop who's on board?
What do you want, Rico? A suicide?
There's heavily armed men down there.
What chance has one lousy cop got, especially if it's a dame?
Boy, what a mess!
Pelham One Two Three, come in.
This is Garber.
Here is Pelham One Two Three.
Come in, Garber.
For Christ's sake, fella, did ya have to do it?
One of my men was fired at.
I warned you what the penalty would be.
- Yeah, you warned me.
- Where's the money?
I'm going to give you 30 seconds more.
Hey, you guys!
- Christ, who's that?
- Transit cop. I got orders for you.
Resume delivery on the double.
I don't suppose we could have that in writin'?
Mr. Blue, we got a light!
All right. Open the door, would you, Mr. Brown?
All right, gentlemen.
Hands in evidence, please.
Put up your hands!
All right. Throw the money up here.
Into the cab.
Push it up.
Thank you. Now turn around.
Go home to your wives and children.
Keep the hands up. Take it very easily.
Shut the door, Mr. Brown, will you?
Oh...
Mr. Grey.
Jesus H. Christ!
I've never seen a million dollars in my life before.
You can load up first, Mr. Grey.
I'll talk to Garber.
All that money! I can't believe it!
I'm gonna die today.
Well... either you live or you die.
- That's 18 packs each, right?
- Right.
This is Pelham One Two Three.
Do you read me, Garber?
- This is Garber. Go ahead.
- I'm gonna give you three instructions.
Each one is to be followed precisely.
Ls that clear?
So far.
One, at the end of this conversation, you will restore power to the entire sector.
Right. Restore power. Go ahead.
Two, you will clear the local track all the way from 28th Street to South Ferry.
By clear I mean switches properly set, all signals green.
I emphasize green, Garber.
If I so much as see a red light, let alone get tripped by one,
I'll shoot another hostage.
You will also remove all police from the tunnel.
If I see a policeman between here and South Ferry,
I'll shoot another hostage.
Any deviation,
I'll shoot another hostage.
Listen, fella, I hope you take this in the right spirit, but after this is over you should seek psychiatric help.
Let me know when all my points have been complied with. Over and out.
- Rico, are you there?
- I'm here, Z. What's up?
Hold on while I cut in the city cops.
Frank, hook me up and get outta there.
What a way to run a railroad!
- Inspector Daniels. This is Garber.
- This is Daniels.
Inspector, I have Lieutenant Patrone of the Transit Police on the line.
I have the latest instructions from the hijackers.
They want power restored, all tracks cleared, signals green to South Ferry, and no cops anywhere in sight.
OK, sir, so we go along with that.
We have to. But then what?
- What do you think they got in mind?
- Beats me, Z.
I wouldn't have picked a tunnel for my getaway.
But they did pick it.
And since everything they've done has been worked out to the smallest detail, it stands to reason they got the rest worked out, too.
Power restored and track cleared.
But why South Ferry?
Well, do you think it's the water, Rico?
Maybe they got a boat in the harbor.
I don't know. We'd better play it one step at a time.
Garber; you see about restorin' the power.
I'll start pullin' our units out of the tunnel.
We can follow them on the street.
Except how do we know where they'll be?
Grand Central Tower has 'em on their model board.
We can see every move they make.
They stop any place before South Ferry, we know about it.
I'll check in when I get to my car.
Wait, I just figured out how they're gonna get away.
- I'm listenin'.
- They're gonna fly the train to Cuba.
You're a sick man, Rico.
Whaddaya want me to do?
The power's still off! Move 'em by bus!
What do you mean you haven't got any buses? Go out and hijack some!
Hey, Garber, what's goin' on?
Do I get my trains back now or don't I?
You don't. Not yet.
Do you realize the goddamn rush hour starts in an hour?
Will you shut up and listen?
I got a new set of instructions.
I don't give a rat's ass for your fuckin' instructions!
I'm not liftin' a finger to help the killers of Caz Dolowicz.
Hey!
Now you listen to me, you dumb son of a bitch.
If you don't do what I tell you, you'll be havin' dinner tonight with Caz Dolowicz!
Jesus Christ, what are you...!
OK.
Better take the case out.
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Pay attention, please.
In a while we hope to be moving again.
Then, with a bit of luck, you'll all be released unharmed.
Until then, of course, you'll continue to obey my orders.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Hey, dude.
As you're goin' downtown anyway, you mind droppin' me off at Fulton Street?
You're a wise mother, you know that?
How'd you like some more?
This'll give 'em a jolt, even before they expected it.
- Look at this.
- Holy Christ, she's movin'.
They promised to wait until we cleared track all the way down.
Jenkins, get Command Center.
Grand Central Tower, callin' Command Center.
- This is Command Center.
- She's movin'.
- Who's movin'?
- Pelham One Two Three.
What? Since when?
Just started.
Hold on. I'll put ya on a tie-in.
Rico, she's movin'.
- Who's movin'?
- Who do ya think? Pelham.
- It's too soon. We're not set up yet.
- You heard from Daniels yet?
He's in a squad car on Park Avenue South.
- Inspector? She's movin', sir.
- Who's movin'?
What's the matter with everybody?
How many hijacked trains we got?
They're not supposed to do that yet.
How far have they gone?
- Grand Central? How far have they gone?
- Comin' up on 23rd Street.
Better move those cops off the platform.
Better follow along down Park Avenue.
Get me 23rd Street.
Comin' in to 23rd Street.
All right. Steady as she goes now.
Garber? Just had a terrible thought.
Suppose they're not on the train?
What if they set the throttle and jumped off?
While we're chasin' the train, they're sneakin' out somewhere behind us.
Ingenious, sir, except it's impossible.
- Why?
- A gizmo known as a deadman's feature.
It's built into the control handle in case the motorman drops dead.
The handle has to have a man's hand pressing down on it, hard, at all times.
Otherwise the thing don't work.
The train stops cold.
Ah, I see.
Nice try, though. I'll give 'em a call in case you're still worried about it.
Pelham One Two Three, what's goin' on down there?
The tracks aren't cleared yet.
How come you're movin'?
We're trying to put some distance between us and all those policemen you've got hidden back there.
If you keep moving, you're gonna run into a lot of red signals.
- I don't want you to blame us for it.
- L won't blame you for anything.
Just let us know when you've cleared the track. OK, signing off.
Do you think he's able to figure anything out?
I mean, all those questions.
Not surprising under the circumstances, is it?
They're thinking what we want them to think.
Ah, there it is.
OK. Stop a few yards past it, will you?
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Green.
He shutdown again. Pass it along.
Grand Central Tower callin' Command
Center. Come in, Command Center.
Command Center.
She stopped again, Lieutenant.
Below 18th Street station.
Got ya. Thanks.
Inspector, they stopped again.
Where are you?
- Approachin' 17th Street.
- Pull over. You're right above them.
And then what?
It's up to them.
I'll get back to you, sir.
Pelham One Two Three. Callin'
Pelham One Two Three. Come in, please.
Pelham One Two Three,
Pelham One Two Three, this is Command Center.
Come in.
Quick as you can.
Pelham One Two Three.
This is Garber. Come in, please.
Come in, please.
What the hell's goin' on out there?
Who s-s-said you could talk?
Pelham One Two Three, come in. Pelham
One Two Three, why don't you answer?
Frank, how long before the track's cleared?
You mean before this railroad is so fucked
- it'll take a computer to put it back?
- Yes, Frank, that's what I meant.
About five or six minutes.
I got a snag at Brooklyn Bridge.
- There's somethin' goin' on down there.
- Whaddaya think?
I don't have the slightest idea.
Listen Rico, I don't care what those clowns said, I want men on every...
Wait a minute. Hold on a second.
Inspector Daniels?
I think we need officers on every platform from 14th Street to South Ferry.
That's a good idea, Lieutenant. Will do.
I'll come up to 17th Street and join ya.
Rico, how you coming along with that list of motormen?
They're workin' on it.
I told 'em to rush it.
Come up here and take over the radio for me.
But don't tell 'em the track's clear until you hear from me.
I don't want them startin' again until I get there.
Will do, Z.
- Inspector Daniels?
- Daniels.
Oh, I, uh... I thought you were a, uh... like a shorter guy.
I don't know what I thought.
- Anythin' happenin'?
- They're still down there.
If this street collapsed, we'd land right on top of 'em.
Command Center to DCI, Manhattan.
Yeah, Rico, this is Garber.
Track's been cleared for two minutes.
Do you want me to call the hijackers?
Yeah, let 'em know. And let us know when they start movin', will ya?
What do we do? If they pick up speed on us we'll have trouble keepin' up.
I think we oughta take off.
Get a jump on them for a change.
Move it.
Tell the sergeant to hold the men here until further word.
Yes, sir.
Fits like a glove.
- Ls it gonna come away clean?
- It's gonna work all right.
Command Center to
Pelham One Two Three.
- Who's that?
- Give me the mike.
- Here.
- This is Pelham.
- What happened to Garber?
- Even great men have to pee.
Just letting you know the track's cleared all the way to South Ferry.
Thank you.
Give the lieutenant my regards.
- Do it yourself, at the arraignment.
- Over and out.
Best get going.
All right, Mr. Brown.
You will all remain seated.
That means nobody is to get up.
OK.
- Now what?
- Me you're askin'?
OK. Come on.
Hey, where are you goin'?!
I'm a police officer!
- Mr. Blue?
- Yeah, what do you want?
I thought I saw somethin' f-f-fall off.
What do you mean, something?
- Might've been a person. I ain't sure.
- All right, let's make sure.
No, we haven't got time.
Get back up here. Come on.
Command Center,
Pelham One Two Three's in motion!
Where do you think they're takin' us now?!
Don't worry, they're gonna let us all go!
How do you know that?!
They got the money!
They got what they want!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Can't anybody count?
They all four got off!
There's nobody drivin' the fuckin' train!
Anybody in there?!
All right, all clear.
All right, then. You know the drill.
We do it by the numbers. Hats.
- Glasses.
- Drills and numbers...
This is all chickenshit.
Why don't we just do it?
Moustaches.
All right, reverse coats.
Pelham One Two Three 's between Astor
Place and Bleecker. Speed's increasing.
Pelham One Two Three now between Astor Place and Bleecker.
Doesn't make any sense. They know we're monitoring their position.
- So?
- So it's dumb.
Huh, who said crooks were smart?
But these have been smart.
We're overlookin' somethin', Inspector.
OK. New hats.
OK. Magazines in pockets.
I never knew these things went so fast!
We're gonna be killed!
- Stop it! Nobody's gonna get killed!
- A hell of a lot you know, old man!
But I do know! I've been ridin' the subways since before you were born!
I'm an expert. You see, they have something called stoppers, or stickers, or something like that.
And whenever a train goes by a red light, these things stop them.
- There's just one thing, baby!
- What's that?
They're all green!
Inspector, that short move they made between 28th Street and 17th Street.
- Why'd they do that?
- I don't know.
Suppose they wanted to do somethin' they didn't want anybody else to know about?
- Like what?
- Like jumpin' off the train.
Turn around.
We're goin' back to 17th Street.
Like hell we are!
They are not on the train.
I'm sure of it.
I suggested that in the first place.
You shot me down.
- Something about a deadman's feature?
- They figured out how to beat that!
That's their plan!
That's what they started with!
Turn this thing around and burn rubber.
Guns to Mr. Brown.
Mr. Grey, would you be good enough to give that gun to Mr. Brown, please?
No. This ain't gonna go nowhere.
This is gonna stay with me.
Mr. Grey, bring that gun back here, please.
What if they're waitin' for us up there?
I want some heavy artillery with me.
- Mr. Grey, I won't ask you again.
- Blow it outta your ass, Mr. Blue.
Oh, my God.
Let's get his money!
Mr. Green, come on!
Mr. Blue!
Did you get him?
You go on ahead.
We'll meet where we planned. Right?
You better be right about this, Garber.
Well, even if I am, it's probably too late.
Where are those goddamn red lights?!
We're not stopping!
There is going to be a red light!
There has to be!
- What if there isn't?!
- There has to be!
Check the emergency exits!
Inspector, you take 15th Street.
Officer, you take 17th Street.
Right, sir.
Are you a policeman?
Well done. The mayor will go to your funeral.
Excuse me, fella, would you mind droppin' that gun?
Drop it!
Officer, I suppose you couldn't use a quarter of a million dollars, could you?
Quarter of a million? No, thanks.
My accountant says I've accepted enough for this fiscal quarter.
You're the English guy on the radio.
Yes.
- Lieutenant Garber?
- Right. Do you wanna move along?
Excuse me... Do you people still execute in this state?
What? Oh, execute.
No. Not at the moment.
Pity.
Christ.
We'll have an ambulance here in no time, miss. Everything's gonna be OK.
Where are those goddamn red lights?!
Oh, God!
Stop!
There has to be.
It's headin' to the South Ferry loop!
It must be goin' about 70mph!
My God! Look!
We'll never make it!
I told you it would stop. Didn't I?
42nd Street already?
Get that list out on the wire.
Tell 'em it's top priority.
Whaddaya got, Rico?
We got positive identification on the three dead men. Here.
George Steever. Professional guy, huh?
- St Louis.
- Yeah, I know how to read, Rico.
Giuseppe Benvenuto, alias... Joe Welcome.
- Where's the guy who fried himself?
- No card on him.
We got a confirm on his prints from Immigration.
Name's Bernard Ryder. Mercenary soldier. Between wars, I guess.
None of these guys know how to drive a train.
It means it's the motorman who's missin'.
Did you get that list of motormen who were discharged?
Yeah. 78 names.
Yeah, but it's not that bad.
Eight are dead. 22 were rehired.
11 are in jail.
26 moved away.
One's in a mental institution. Another is a member of the Police Department.
That's our man right there.
Sorry to disappoint you, Zachary, but he was accounted for.
- So how many does that leave?
- Only nine.
Only nine. All right, let's get goin'.
What's the name of this guy?
Nathaniel Muscat.
- What'd he get busted for?
- Narcotics.
This way.
- Who's there?
- Transit Police.
Just a minute.
What do you want?
Uh, nothin', fella. Our mistake.
A spokesman for the Transit Authority noted that the subway car carrying the hostages was stopped at the South Ferry loop by the automatic safety features which are activated by any car travelling at excessive speed.
- Transit Authority.
- Still gotta pay.
- Your name is Latimer?
- What about it?
Just answer the question, would ya?
I don't work for you guys anymore.
You don't get shit from me.
Can you account for your whereabouts today, Mr. Latimer?
Are you tryin' to connect me to that hijacking? Forget it!
I've been here since 2:30 this afternoon.
- Are you sure?
- Sure? Ask anybody!
- Don't worry, we will.
- Hold it!
It's still gonna be 50 cents.
- Who's that?
- Police Department.
Who?
Harold Longman, it's the Transit Police.
Oh, Jesus!
Wait a minute!
Just a minute!
- How many more we gotta see today?
- Six, seven. I don't know.
Come on, Mr. Longman, we ain't got all night!
I'll be right out!
I hope he washes his hands before he opens the door.
- Yes, what is it?
- Harold Longman?
We'd like to ask a couple of questions.
What about?
Will you let us in?
We'll just take one minute of your time.
I'm Lieutenant Patrone.
This is Lieutenant Garber.
How do you do?
I'm sorry to bother you like this.
- Nice place you got here, Mr. Longman.
- Thanks.
Can you give us an account of your whereabouts this afternoon?
Why?
- Were you at work?
- No.
- Why not?
- I work nights.
- Where do you work?
- Kennedy Airport.
- What do you do over there?
- I'm a... fork-lift operator.
Oh, I got a brother-in-law does that over in Jersey.
That's interesting work.
What, uh... Where were you this afternoon, Mr. Longman?
- Why?
- You tell me where, I'll tell you why.
I was, uh... right here.
Can anyone verify that fact?
You said you'd tell me why.
- You were here all afternoon?
- I sleep in the afternoon.
- All afternoon?
- Well... till about an hour ago.
- But you heard about the hijacking?
- What hijacking?
- The subway train.
- Subway...
- You gotta be kiddin'!
- Do I look like I'm kiddin'?
I mean, would I be here if I was kiddin', mister?
Subway...! Who'd wanna do a thing like that?
- Hey, Z. You got a match?
- No.
- You got a warrant?
- No.
Supreme Court says you have to have a warrant, unless I'm under arrest.
The way things are goin', they're gonna be changin' that in about 10 minutes.
- Mr. Longman, you got a match?
- No.
That's all right.
I'll get it at the stove.
I'll get it.
It's a little tricky.
Has a tendency to explode.
Come on, Rico, let's go.
Thanks, Mr. Longman.
Mr. Longman, we'll be back later.
Yeah? Listen, I know I got a gripe with the TA. I know I got a bum rap.
But I wouldn't do anythin' as stupid as what you just told me.
What do think I am? A jerk?
Do me a favor, will ya?
Get the hell outta here.
Come on, Mr. Longman. We have to follow our leads. It's our job!
Yeah, yeah. Big deal.
Look, I got my rights. This is my home.
I want a little peace!
Just do me a favor, will ya?
Get the hell outta here.
Sorry if we bothered ya, Mr. Longman.
Come on, Rico.
Gesundheit!
- Oh, I have a reservation.
For Caroline Brace.
- I don't see it here.
- Would you try Shelby please?
- Oh right, so who are you, Shelby or Brace?
- Brace until I married
Shelby and then Shelby again,
Brace again after the divorce.
I don't feel like Shelby anymore.
- Okay I'll change the reservation to Brace.
- Thank you.
- That's right,
I'll take care of that for you.
Please show Miss Brace to fourth floor.
- Caroline!
Caroline!
He's over there.
Oh Caroline, darling!
Oh.
Did David ask you here?
- Yes.
He didn't tell you?
- Oh no that boy never tells his mother anything except goodnight.
Are you gonna get back together?
- Oh, you had to ask.
Let me see, I have to think about that one.
- Don't think.
What is this, some obscene proposal?
- There's a lot of ground to cover, it's all we--
- This person is called McDade.
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.
- He works here.
I always forget what your job is.
- Bookkeeper.
Excuse me, you really should--
- He's a bookkeeper.
Hardly a VIP escorting the great man's mother around.
No offense, McDade.
I like you.
- Thank you.
There's a lot of ground we have to cover.
- Let the heart guide the head, McDade.
And have you got a fella?
- Two or three.
- Holy cow, are you gonna turn into a swinger?
- (chuckles) Am I, let's see, could be.
How is the great man?
- Up to his ass in celebrity.
- Hey Gary, what brings you to this opening?
You said you were gonna quit competition.
What decided you to turn pro?
- I just want to be part of this whole fantastic thing going on here.
- We assume that Mr Shelby--
- Hey Gary.
- Very attractive?
- Well she certainly help.
Besides, I've never done the Golinda before.
- Try the suicide jump?
- Sure, why not?
- What about you, Bruce?
Are you gonna break that downhill record of yours tomorrow?
- It wasn't part of the deal but I'll do my best for you.
- Bruce, from the beginning you seem to thrive on risk.
Have you ever known fear?
- Well I never thought about it.
I ski like I breathe or talk or make love.
- Oh, kinda makes me wonder what you do best.
- Boy, I'll say.
He's established a record of that.
- How are you?
- Bruce!
- You look fantastic!
- Oh thank you.
Kathy, come and get in the picture.
Come on!
- Hey Kathy come on.
- You go ahead.
- How you doing?
A little nervous?
- A little.
- Wow, I can dig that, let me tell you.
- That skier is too fast for Tina.
- How do you girls feel about?
- Well I admit,
I do have my eye on the Show Me Awards.
- I just wanna do the best I can.
- It's terrific to see you.
The two of you together.
- Hello dear.
- How are you today?
- Fine, sir.
- Mother, you and McDade have a full schedule, there's an awful lot to see around here.
- Can't we sit together awhile and have a drink and talk?
- I would like to have some time with Caroline.
- Come on, McDade.
Thanks for the tour.
- See ya.
Hi.
- Looking so good.
Hold the elevator!
- You're looking well, maybe a little tired.
- Excuse me, Mr. Shelby?
- Yeah.
- Any chance of us getting the shot of the Shelby trophy?
- Sure, get all the boys together, meet me in my office.
- [Man] Excuse me.
- Come on, there's something I wanna show you.
- Susan.
- Yes David?
Mr. Shelby?
- This is Mrs. Shelby.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Susan Maxwell, my secretary.
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, did you get ahold of Marty Brenner?
- Not yet.
- Try again.
- I just did.
- Well keep on trying.
- Okay!
- David.
It's just incredible what you've done.
All of it, incredible.
- Yeah (sighs).
Took a lot of time, a lot of effort.
(chuckles) You know.
Through the whole thing I used to think a lot about how we used to lie around on Houston Street and talk a lot.
Quiet elegance.
Planet, remember?
Well.
- Well.
I guess you got it.
- Oh, hell, Caroline.
Okay.
You registered as Brace.
- Yes?
It's who I am.
- I wanted to change it back to Caroline Shelby.
- You can't do that.
- You could.
I wanna talk.
I don't even know what I wanna talk about,
I mean, can we just talk?
- Sure.
- This is the big one.
Four years ago I came out here and I saw that mountain out there and I knew, I'm climbing it.
I opened up this magnificent country for myself and for anybody who wants to join me.
I fought like a son of a bitch.
I fought the bank, I fought the government.
I fought even my own corporation.
Hell, I built an empire for them.
And then the environmentalists, they say I'm destroying the environment.
Come here, come here, let me show you something.
Here.
Look out here.
Does this look like I'm destroying?
I'm creating a beautiful life here.
It's a good thing that's happening.
- What's wrong, then?
- One of the planning commissioners I had to deal with is under investigation.
- What, about this?
- Oh no.
There's some other corporate connections.
- Yeah, and?
- (sighs) Well, I bought some of this land from one of those corporations.
- Isn't that a matter of public record?
- Yes, and so is a sizeable contribution I made toward his senatorial campaign.
Hello?
Well keep trying.
Damn it!
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna take you to lunch, I don't wanna talk about this mess, you're here, I...
I love that you're here.
I love you.
- Lunch, huh?
- Right.
And, how is your life, are you still working for Harper's Bazaar?
- Vogue--
- Oh yes I mean Vogue.
Hello.
Right, send them in.
(chuckles) Press.
I'm David Shelby.
Mr. Cavelli.
- I know, she's a little off center, like she wasn't twirler last year.
She's getting it together.
Thatta girl, Kathy!
- You all right, Kathy?
Need anything?
It doesn't mean anything at all.
It's all right, it's okay.
- No Leo, it's not.
I always do that to myself.
When I saw her.
- Yes, she'll get to you.
You forgot how beautiful you are.
Love yourself.
And when you're doing that spin, you'll find your center and you'll let go.
And don't let anything in the world guide you off your center.
- So miners are digging for silver in the 1880s, and the mountain avalanched.
Buried everybody.
No one's dared touch it since.
- Until David.
Of course.
David is amazing.
How did he ever convince all those bankers?
- He didn't.
- He didn't?
- Nobody else would follow him up here.
He's all alone this time.
- Alone?
- Yes, he's risked everything he has.
All his personal holdings.
- In case you haven't noticed, not only are we out of doors--
And knee-deep in snow, but we are also going uphill!
- Always uphill.
You get to the top.
- Oh, if I had the strength,
I would write that down.
Oh!
- Well, this is important.
You can see.
Mr. Shelby shall ice fish.
He'll have an absolutely clear view.
- Well, he's just like his father was.
He has to be king of the mountain.
- [Pauly] Hey Mr. Thorne!
- [Nick] How ya doing, Pauly?
- You were right about that salt lick, getting low.
The mountain carried down from Big Face ever since the high wind.
- All right, I'll bring you up one tomorrow.
Your boss say your captain's low?
- Yes sir.
- Mr. Shelby and the architect decided it was desirable.
We want an absolutely unimpeded view.
- I see.
- [Pauly] How's that stick, Mr. Thorne?
- What are you doing this for, Pauly?
- Man's gotta eat.
- What's the gimmick?
- There is no gimmick now.
That was the reaction of one stable snow to the sound waves made by that saw.
In addition, Mr. McDada, the slope is not stable.
With those trees missing, it's dangerous.
Good day.
- Who's he?
- I'm sorry, his name is Nick Thorne.
He's a photographer.
And well-known.
Got all the time in the world for nature.
None for its development.
- Are you kidding?
- Oh!
- Very neat.
- Ah, piece of cake.
- You got lucky.
- [Bruce] Yeah.
- What are you doing up here,
I thought you were skiing Big Face?
- Just felt like practicing on my own away from the crowds.
- I would check conditions.
- I just did.
- Artie, don't argue with me, get your ass up here, damn it.
Well something is going on!
All right.
This morning, some snot nose reporter started asking about
Maybrook and the clearance of the land and I don't like it.
Well it could mean a lot!
I want you to get on that plane with a file and be up here by tomorrow night.
God it's hard to come down from that guy.
And don't give me that
I don't approve look.
- No, mm.
I don't approve or disapprove.
David, you're like weather, you just happen.
I came to collect that lunch.
- My god, lunch.
Forgot.
- Supremacy tactics.
- One day it'll work, watch.
- Shelby!
I wanna talk to you.
- Oh, Nick.
Good to see you.
Someone I want you to meet, John.
- You're crazy to cut down those trees.
- Caroline, this is Nick Thorne.
You know his work.
- Oh yes, of course.
- And this is my wife,
Caroline--
- Mrs. Shelby.
Look, let me put it to you this way.
Without that cover, everything below that place you're building is open to a slide.
- Oh Nick, we'll talk about it later this afternoon.
- Oh, that's what you said last week.
I wanna talk now.
- (sighs) I'm sorry, honey.
I have to talk to Nick.
20 minutes, a half an hour at the most.
Then lunch--
- David, I'll see you at dinner, okay?
Nice to meet you, Mr. Thorne.
- But it's next to the banquet, we won't have any time.
- At least I know you'll be there.
- There's just not enough hazard up on that salt to carry on about cutting down a few trees.
- There is a hazard, David.
Look, these mountains have gotten along without you for a long time.
- Oh, hello Tina.
- Hi.
- Go easy, huh?
- Okay.
- These mountains have gotten along without you for a long time and you come barreling in here with big plans to rearrange the whole thing.
- No, Nick.
Sharon.
- Sharon?
- Harry.
Scotch on the rocks, you want a drink?
- Nothing.
You're risking the lives of everyone you are inviting here to Sharon.
- That man works in front of the commissions, but now you have to deal with me.
I want people to enjoy this land, not bury them in it.
- Oh Dave.
- Philip.
- How you doing, Nick?
Listen, David, I'm gonna need the rosters for--
- Will you, as a professional, tell this lunatic about the reports?
- What reports--
- All of them, the snow reports, the whole damn thing.
- Okay.
They just finished skiing the entire area and all our data says it's fine.
- I don't wanna hear about the surveys, Phil,
I know what they say.
What I'm asking you is why are you having cleaned off old (mumbles)?
- Oh come on, Nick, I settled that corners day ago.
- It's building.
You got a storm coming in tonight and people all over that slope, and
I don't know how you can ignore that hazard.
- Hey now wait a minute.
I'm not ignoring anything.
Now there isn't a procedure in the book I haven't covered.
- [Nick] You're stuck in the book, Phil, you always were.
- That's right because it's my job.
- [Nick] Look, before the slopes are open at least fire a shell into that ledge before it pulls the mountain down on us.
- Now you listen to me.
I love this place as much as you do and you damn well know it.
And that storm should be over by morning, and right now everything says we're fine.
- When was the last time you went up on that mountain and just sat?
- Oh bullshit, Nick.
I work up there--
- Just go up there and sit, Phil.
- Ridiculous.
- Just sit, Phil.
Things aren't normal, there's a heaviness and it's growing.
I can feel it.
- Oh for God's sake.
You want to panic the whole population because you feel a heaviness?
Well let me tell you something,
I don't move with your premonition,
I move with my judgment.
Come on, Philip, I'll get you your God damn papers.
- [Caroline] Hi there!
- Hello, Mrs. Shelby.
- Huh?
- I say, hello, Mrs. Shelby.
- Brace.
We're divorced.
- I knew I'd seen you someplace before.
- In the lobby.
- No, it was before that.
- Ah, on David's desk in a frame.
- That's right.
He's a tough guy.
- Yep.
- Do you like him?
- Let me see, I have to think about that.
I don't know.
I love him.
(chuckles) You know.
- Sure.
- Gosh, I hope there'll be a snow storm.
While I'm up here I wanna see the whole works.
I love snow storms, they make the world look entirely different, don't you think?
- Different is better?
- What do you think?
- No, I think things look pretty good from right here.
It's cold out here, aren't you cold?
- Yep, I'm freezing.
Come on inside.
Oh.
You coming to the party tonight?
Or do you hate that sort of thing?
- No, I don't hate that sort of thing.
I'm just not sure I can celebrate all this.
- What do you celebrate?
Well.
Maybe I'll see you sometime.
I hope you change your mind.
- [Radio Announcer] Six inches of fresh snow.
12 degrees at the top.
Wind's at 40 miles per hour.
Chill factor, minus 16 degrees.
(mumbles) 114 inch base, 11 inches.
Fresh Powder, 20 degrees at the summit.
Cameron, 105 base, eight inches Fresh Powder.
Icy conditions prevail Red Mountain.
- Sure wish you could come tonight, Bud.
- Oh I'd like to, David, but I better go across to White Ice station.
My boys called me about some conditions.
I weren't sure what they're talking about.
The earliest I could get back is tomorrow.
- Hey there's Mark Elliot.
Excuse me, Philip.
Mark, good to see you.
- David.
Well it's good to be here.
- Well come on, let's get you settled.
Sammy, would you get Mr.
Elliot's luggage please, room 509.
It's great, isn't it?
Gonna do a little skiing while you're here?
- I'll try.
When does your TV crew arrive?
- Noon tomorrow.
- Oh good.
Is Scott here?
- Everybody's here.
- Great.
- Including your wife.
- Tina's here?
- She arrived with Scott this morning.
Nobody knew she was coming.
- Kinda surprised.
Couple of months, that's a long time for Bruce.
As a matter of fact, it's a long time for Tina also.
- Yeah, well I'm embarrassed.
- Well there's no reason.
- And.
She'll be sitting at our table tonight.
With Bruce.
- That's showbiz.

- Oh you always have to have an opinion.
- I'll have you on my show tomorrow night.
- It won't be your show if you do.
- But what would I say?
- You'll think of something.
- We're just gonna talk about exactly what we're talking about.
- I really would prefer to be on the show tomorrow night.
You got a terrific accident yet you're still personal with the people you talk to.
- You hear that?
I'm gonna have to kiss you for that.
You're gonna have to repeat exactly what you said just now tomorrow night.
- Well I don't know.
- Excuse me, would you like to dance?
- Oh sure.
- All right.
- Where'd you get them?

- Well, who would have thought?
Nick!
Come join us.
- Thank you.
- I'll get another chair.
- Hey, I'm glad you decided to join us.
- You.
- Florence, this is Nick Thorne.
- Champagne?
- Mark Elliot, Mark Elliot, pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure--
- And Tina Elliot.
- Nick Thorne, you did that layout in the National Geographic.
- Recent?
- About a month ago.
- Smithsonian.
- That's right, on the grizzlies of the Aleutian.
- Kodiaks.
- Would you like to dance?
- Why?
- Oh (chuckles).
- Please.
- Thank you.
Look, I don't know how to do this kind of dancing.
- That's okay, we'll think of something.
David is staring at me.
- I don't blame him.
- You dance very well.
- Considering.
I think you have this idea I'm some kind of wild man of the mountain.
- Wild man of the mountain.
- Well, I wish you wouldn't think of me quite that way.
- No, I rather enjoy that image.
- What?
- David is staring at Susan the more he stares at me.
- Does it bother you?
- No.
It liberates me.
- Do you ever have a really bad fall?
- Not since I was 15.
A fantastic instructor taught me the art of falling.
- Did he ever explain, when you're sure you're not falling and you know you can't stop it.
You just have to go with it.
- He taught me never to resist.
- Aloha!
- Mother, this is not Hawaii.
- It is if I say so.
- You have to decide how to land.
- You mean the position of your body?
- Right, position of the body is very important.
- I rather like it on my back.
- Sideways (mumbles).
- You fall sideways?
- Makes for a change.
- Far out.
- Good night everybody,
I'm gonna hit the sack.
It was a great party.
- Aloha!
- Good night, Mr. Elliot.
I'm looking very forward to being on your show tomorrow.
- I'm looking very forward to having you.
- (chuckles) Good night.
Good night.
- Let's dance, honey.
- (sighs) Very good dance.
Took my breath away, oh.
Huh, what is this?
You hate dancing.
- Wait.
What's going on with you?
- Nothing, I'm fine.
- You just met the guy this afternoon.
- So?
- Don't give me so.
You'll never get him away from the buffalo and the deer and the antelope.
Who asked you, and who asked you?
- I just don't want to see you screw yourself up.
- Don't worry, I won't.
- Won't though?
- I won't.
- Aloha, naughty Lloyd.
- Thank you.
- Do you even know what you're doing?
You must be tired of all this crap.
It took us years to grow up.
- About whom are you speaking?
- What's going on, I only asked you to dance.
- You didn't ask me to dance, you told me to dance.
You got to run the whole show.
You panic if you haven't got complete control.
It's always the same thing.
I got to the point where
I didn't know what I felt about anything.
- I just want to be with you.
What's wrong with wanting to be with you, or you wanting to be with me?
- You stifle me!
I need some space, I need some room.
I've gotta make my own decisions.
Just leave me alone.
- I don't wanna leave you alone.
- Well that's a problem I can solve.
- Caroline!
- Enjoy yourself, gonna hit the sack.
Thanks.
- Aloha!
- Oh--
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, are you leaving?
- Yeah, I'm ready to escape.
- Let's.
- Yep, better bundle up.
- Uh-huh.
- You got your storm coming.
- Feels good.
- Does it make everything seem different?
- No (chuckles).
Thank you.
- Watch your step.
- [Caroline] Boy, what a wild place to live.
- [Nick] You think so?
- It's exciting out here.
- Careful.
Right here, be careful.
- Freezing.
Boy.
- Hot chocolate, beer?
- Beer, please.
You built this house yourself, didn't you?
- [Nick] Yeah.
- Figures.
I like it.
I don't know if I could handle the isolation though.
What is this thing?
- What's it look like?
- A goat?
- That's a ram.
- A ram.
I like your pictures, I really do.
- Thank you.
- Oh I see you have a, what do you call it, you do your printing here?
- Yeah.
Wanna take a look, go ahead.
- Yeah, thank you.
- That whatcha-ma-call-it is--
- Enlarger.
- Thank you.
I don't know what to say.
- Can I give you a big hug?
- Did you ever see me do my flying (mumbles)?
- I don't think I've ever seen you do one more graceful.
- It's a spin that won me the gold medal.
- Oh it did.
- I did everything they told me.
- That sounds real kinky.
- And a wonderful old fashioned lay back.
- I love it.
- [Woman] Marvelous.
Marvelous.
Spread eagle.
- [Bruce] What other heavy moves you gonna lay on me?
- [Woman] Have you ever seen My Lady?
It's too fast for me.
- [Bruce] You gotta be fast to stay on top.
- I like to go forward.
Taking moves one by one.
By one.
- Bruce, honey.
Bruce!
Bruce honey.
- Let me go--
- Tina.
- Let me go--
- Tina.
- Let me go!
- Baby, baby.
Tina!
- Hello, yeah.
What?
Well get a caterpillar up there, we gotta get her fixed by noon.
That's right, I said by noon.
I'll be right there.
Good morning.
Morning.
We had a little trouble with the rink last night.
- Would you like your orange juice?
- Yeah.
- Mhm.
Hello?
Ugh.
Yeah Marty, what?
I don't care about your pilot in those weather conditions,
I want you and that file on a plane up here tonight.
No, Marty, you.
Not the National Guard or the Marine Corps, you, and that file in your hot little hands.
Marty!
We are talking about a 10 year multi-million dollar project and you are telling me about clouds.
Well give another $500, see how his vision improves.
- Nick?
- [Radio Announcer] News from Colorado and the west.
A blizzard that hit southwestern Colorado last night is nearly over.
- Good morning!
How do you feel?
- Pretty good.
- Sleep well?
I want you rating that on a scale of 10.
Seven?
Eight?
Nine?
Was she that good?
- Tina, either put that apple down or throw it at me.
- It wouldn't hurt you enough if I threw it.
- My ass hurts enough already.
Jealousy's the biggest pain in the ass.
- God damn you!
Stop acting as if you didn't get away with anything, you son of a bitch!
- This is what you usually threaten to kill yourself.
- I'll cut you to shreds, you bastard!
- Why can't you play it the way your husband plays, he's got real style.
- Stop it!
- (mumbles) Kill yourself.
- No, no, no, no.
No, no.
No.
I love you too.
- Tina.
Please.
- There he is!
- Morning, lady.
Have you seen Caroline this morning?
- No.
- Oh.
Well, I gotta get the world rolling.
Wanna come along?
- What?
- I'm going to work with the wonders.
Do you wanna watch?
- What are you going to do, freeze the Red Sea?
- (chuckles) For you, anything.
- But not outdoors.
- Next year, indoors.
- Give me a little bit.
- Hey.
- Don't you drink too many of those things.
- Right on!
- [Announcer] We're just about to start our first event.
The first international snowmobile invitational, featuring the Norwegian nutcracker.
(mumbles) Challenging Colorado's own--
- Bye.
- [Announcer] The man who made snowmobile racing a dirty sport.
- Get back.
- Bitch.
- [Woman] Bastard.
- Try this.
- Goal!
- [Woman] Come on, baby!
- [Announcer] You are seeing some of the bravest jumpers assembled here today.
Here in (mumbles) Sun Valley.
That sky dive (mumbles) sheer guns of nature.
Once you take off at 60 miles an hour, you just start flailing your bowls like--
With the ground when you hit it.
An early take-off, he's in the air, off-center.
He's trying to regain his balance.
What the heck was that?
All the way down the mountain.
All the way to (mumbles).
- Woo!
Thank you.
Thank you, folks.
All right.
All right.
Well now that you've cut the ribbon, Bruce,
I feel that it's only appropriate that you be the first man up.
One.
I really don't wanna test it.
And two, I mean it's quite obvious from your record that you need some kind of a head start.
I feel like Bruce Scott is one of the finest athletes in the world.
His skill and dedication to skiing have brought a new kind of excitement and given a very special meaning to (mumbles).
I just like to say for all your friends up here, Bruce, and all your friends all over the skiing world that we owe you a great deal.
- Mark, thank you.
Let's go up the slopes!
- Hey Bruce!
- Ella.
- Can we have your autograph?
- Sure, ladies.
- All right.
- Right up on a chair--
- Right?
- I think you're gonna bring a lot of pleasure to a lot of people.
- I now wanna thank everybody for making all of this possible.
Have a good day.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- You did great.
That was really great.
- Thanks.
- What are they, asleep?
- No, Mr. Brenner, we're under the MRA.
We can't contact either end because of the terrain.
- Oh for Christ sake.
- Stay here and watch
Mommy and Daddy speed down.
- And finally, we have the 10th (mumbles) who are patrons of the Colorado Cup.
Well ladies and gentlemen, this new lift is now officially open.
So let's do some skiing!
How 'bout it, pal?
Gonna go up?
Miss Courtney!
Is it all right?
- Well if you really want to!
- And on, heh.
Well, I'm Mark, who are you?
- Jason.
- Mr. Shelby I've made this trip 100 times.
It's never been this bad.
- Could we have flown past?
- [Ed] No, I'm scared we're a lot closer than we wanna be.
- What does this mean?
- [Ed] We're losing power.
Our fuel's starting to fluctuate.
- Ed, find a place to sit this thing down.
- How old are you?
- Got an ID?
- Uh-huh.
- [Man] See you at the bottom when I get down.
- Look there's Bruce Scott!
- [Announcer] Lake Champlain is next.
Coming up now, Gary!
For Gary, rated number two ski jumper in the nation.
This is the first time on the (mumbles).
- What is it?
- Hey!
Can you hear me?
- Easy.
Easy now, easy Jason.
Move your arm, move easy.
I've got you.
Turn, turn.
Atta boy, it's okay, easy.
Good.
- Bill!
Bill!
You all right?
- Yes.
My neck.
- How's it feel?
- I think it's okay.
- What are you doing up here?
- I was on my way up here, worried about that crazy thing when it broke.
- With an air plane that started to slide.
Looks bad.
- All right look, if you get down there, the rink,
I'll get the hotel.
As quick as you can, yeah?
- You bet.
- Both doors are jammed.
- Oh terrific.
Ah.
Hey!
- Gas.
- The worst.
- The power's out and there was an explosion in the kitchen and the dining room's blocked off.
There may be some people trapped.
- Outside.
- Some guy's working on that right now.
- Right, have you seen my mother, where's Caroline?
- No but David, there's a gas leak in the kitchen, it may be going into the dining room.
- [David] Well then we get the boilers going full blast.
- David, the power is out.
- Steve, I want you to take whoever you need, get up the last rig, work on that back up generator.
I want it operating.
- Yes, sir.
- Get blankets, sheets, all you can carry.
- Right.
- Get above the skating rink as fast as you can.
Can't anybody get through to Cedar Falls?
- [Woman] We're completely cut off!
- Get her out of here and see if you can make that thing work.
- Been trying, boss, we can't get through anywhere.
- Well keep on trying!
You got any dynamite?
- What's going on?
- We're gonna have to blast from the other side of the hotel, people trapped inside.
- Oh Nick, you son of a bitch.
- [Steve] David!
You know, if we blast too close, the whole damn thing could cave in.
- Well if we don't, we'll asphyxiate.
- Well what do you wanna do?
- Blast.
- [Henry] Mrs. Shelby.
- Florence, God damn it.
- That will do any good?
- I'm not gonna sit here.
I'm gonna dig us out.
- What's going on?
- Well, we can blast maybe one more time.
And we better just dig.
- David!
David!
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
- Have you seen my mother?
- No, I don't know where she is.
- Oh my God.
- [Man In Blue] What are you gonna do now?
- We're gonna set up.
- What?
- We're gonna shoot this God damn thing.
Haul that stuff up here.
- Are you all right?
- Has anyone seen my Jeanette?
- I'll see if I can find out.
Harmon, it's Harmon's hat!
- Bruce!
- Hey!
Hey!
Can you hear me?
- Oh.
McDade, we're...
Hm.
♪ If you were the only boy in the world ♪
♪ And I was the only girl ♪
- No!
Don't go to sleep, Mrs. Shelby.
- Go, Phil.
- Okay.
- [Henry] You all right?
- What is it, I bring down the house again?
- I think they're dynamiting the snow from outside.
- [Florence] Yeah?
Oh, it's cold.
- Well that's it, come on, we gotta dig.
- Florence.
- [Steve] Take some of this, David.
- I'm over here!
I'm over here!
Mr. Shelby.
- Oh my God.
- Philip!
I got her.
Okay, easy, easy.
- Anything?
- I don't think so.
- Over here!
- She's starting to breathe.
- Now you behave, huh?
- Get out of here, McDade.
- It's Henry, God damn it.
- Please, sir.
- Mom?
- I don't want that.
I want a bloody Mary.
- Put that back--
- She's all right.
And keep it on.
You had a scare.
- [Man] Please let's not crowd the lady.
- Please!
Charlie, get there with the chair lift.
- He can't be dead.
He can't be!
- [Man] We'll take the snow caps.
- Come on, grab ahold.
- It's slipping.
I've got it.
- Come on boys, we've got no time to lose.
Come on.
Come on guys, hurry up.
Move it!
- It's gotta run like clockwork, guys.
You and you, start getting the net out.
Virgil, get us as close as you can.
Get right under and be ready to move.
Now let's go.
- I can't hold it--
- Just hold on.
No, no, no, no, Jason.
Hold on, hold on, sweetheart.
Easy, easy.
Now listen to me, listen to me carefully.
You see that there's a net down there?
- Yeah.
- Okay, now, all you have to do, you just have to, you just have to close your eyes and just jump and they're gonna catch us, all right?
- I don't want to.
- I think that this is gonna be the only way down right now.
Because I'm a little more scared than you are, would it be all right if you jump first?
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna come right down after you, okay?
- You promise?
- Oh yes.
Oh I promise.
Okay!
Now just close your eyes and jump.
- He okay?
The boy is safe!
Let go!
- David!
- Just let go!
- Mark, come on!
- All right Jason!
- [Man] He'll live.
- [Man] How many?
- We don't know yet.
Hey.
What happened?
- There were slides all along the route.
We got cut off from near the unit.
We had to turn around but we sent the plows out last street.
- Do you have Mrs. Shelby in there?
- No sir, she's in the lead unit.
- Do you know if she got through?
- [Bearded Man] The radio there headed toward this bridge.
- Nick, let's go!
- Yeah.
- Hang on, Caroline!
- [Nick] Dave, got a line coming.
Here it comes.
Grab hold.
- That's it, now the other arm.
That's right.
Now hang onto the rope.
- Here we go.
Keep coming, keep coming.
Got you.
Good and chilled.
- How is he?
- He's all right, considering.
He's a fighter.
- Yeah, my God.
Look at this place.
- Yep, take years to reclaim it all.
I'm glad you were here.
It was important.
- Yeah, thanks.
- I like you.
Just the way you are.
- Take care of yourself, huh?
- Goodbye, Caroline.
- [Caroline] Hi.
- Hi.
I have nothing to say.
- Would you like some champagne?
- Sure.
What shall we drink to?
- We survived.
- Yeah.
We survived.
And I always thought survival meant being king of the mountain.
Well.
How is this for a quiet elegance?
- Nice view.
- I do have something to say.
I caused all of this.
I am responsible.
- You've never said that.
David, I love you.
- [David] I know.
- A lot.
- Thank you, my friend.
- I have to go.
- Of course you do.

Whoa, there!
Halt!
Who goes there? lt is l, Arthur, Son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.
King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons.
Sovereign of all England!
Pull the other one. l am, and this my trusty servant, Patsy.
We have ridden the length of the land in search of knights...
...who will join me in my court at Camelot. l must speak with your lord and master.
-What? Ridden on a horse?
-Yes.
-You're using coconuts!
-What?
You've got two empty halves of coconut, and you're banging them together.
So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land.
-Through the Kingdom of Mercia.
-Where did you get the coconuts?
We found them.
Found them? ln Mercia?
The coconut is tropical.
-What do you mean?
-Well, this is a temperate zone.
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover...
...may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
-Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
-Not at all. They could be carried.
-What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
-lt could grip it by the husk. lt's not a question of where he grips it. lt's a simple question of weight ratio.
A 5-ounce bird could not carry a 1-pound coconut. lt doesn't matter. Go tell your master that Arthur from Camelot is here. ln order to maintain air-speed velocity...
...a swallow needs to beat its wings
43 times every second, right?
-Please!
-Am l right?
-l'm not interested.
-lt could be carried by an African swallow.
Oh, yes! An African swallow, maybe.
Not a European swallow. That's my point. l agree with that.
Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?
But then, of course,
African swallows are non-migratory.
-Oh, yes.
-They couldn't bring a coconut, anyway.
Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows carried it together?
-No, they'd have to have it on a line.
-Simple. They'd use a strand of creeper.
-Held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
-Why not?
Bring out your dead!
Ninepence.
-Bring out your dead.
-Here's one.
Ninepence.
-l'm not dead!
-What?
-Nothing. There's your ninepence.
-l'm not dead!
-He says he's not dead.
-Yes, he is.
-l'm not!
-He isn't.
-He will be soon. He's very ill.
-l'm getting better!
You'll be stone dead in a moment. l can't take him like that. lt's against regulations.
-l don't want to go on the cart.
-Don't be such a baby.
-l can't take him.
-l feel fine.
-Well, do us a favour.
-l can't.
Can you hang around a few minutes?
He won't be long.
Got to go to the Robinsons'.
They've lost nine today.
-When's your next round?
-Thursday.
-l think l'll go for a walk.
-You're not fooling anyone, you know.
-lsn't there something you can do?
-l feel happy.
-Thanks very much.
-Not at all. See you on Thursday.
Right.
-Who's that, then?
-l don't know. Must be a king.
-Why?
-He hasn't got shit all over him.
-Old woman!
-Man!
Man. Sorry.
What knight lives in that castle over there?
-l'm 37.
-What?
-l'm 37. l'm not old.
-l can't just call you ''man.''
-You could say, ''Dennis.''
-l didn't know you were a Dennis.
You didn't bother to find out. l did say sorry about the ''old woman,'' but from behind--
What l object to is that you treat me like an inferior.
-Well, l am king.
-King? Very nice.
How did you get that?
By exploiting the workers!
By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates...
...the economic and social differences in our society!
-lf there's ever going to be any progress--
-There's some lovely filth down here.
How do you do?
How do you do, good lady? l am Arthur, King of the Britons.
-Whose castle is that?
-King of the who?
-The Britons.
-Who are the Britons?
We all are. We're all Britons.
And l am your king.
Didn't know we had a king.
We're an autonomous collective.
You're fooling yourself.
We're living in a dictatorship.
A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working class--
There you go. Bringing class into it again.
-That's what it's all about. lf only people--
-Please, good people. l am in haste.
Who lives in that castle?
-No one lives there.
-Who is your lord?
-We don't have a lord.
-What? l told you.
We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.
We take turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
-Yes.
-But all the decisions of that officer...
-...are ratified at a biweekly meeting.
-Yes, l see.
-By majority in the case of internal affairs.
-Be quiet!
-By a two-thirds majority in the case of--
-Be quiet! l order you to be quiet.
''Order.'' Who does he think he is?
-l am your king!
-l didn't vote for you.
-You don't vote for kings.
-How did you become king then?
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite...
...held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water...
...signifying, by divine providence, that l, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.
That is why l'm your king!
Listen. Strange women lying in ponds, distributing swords, is no basis...
...for a system of government.
Supreme executive power...
...derives from a mandate from the masses.
Not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
Be quiet!
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power...
...'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you.
-Shut up!
-lf l went around saying l was an emperor...
...because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!
-Will you shut up?
-See the violence inherent in the system.
-Shut up!
-See the violence inherent in the system!
-Help, l'm being repressed!
-Bloody peasant!
What a give away. Did you hear that?
That's what l'm on about.
Did you see him repressing me?
You fight with the strength of many men,
Sir Knight. l am Arthur, King of the Britons. l seek the finest and bravest knights in the land to join me in Camelot.
You have proved yourself worthy.
Will you join me?
You make me sad. So be it. Come, Patsy.
None shall pass.
-What?
-None shall pass. l have no quarrel with you, good
Sir Knight, but l must cross this bridge.
Then you shall die. l command you, as King of the Britons, to stand aside. l move for no man.
So be it!
Now, stand aside, worthy adversary.
-'Tis but a scratch.
-''A scratch''? Your arm's off.
-No, it isn't.
-Well, what's that, then?
-l've had worse.
-You liar.
Come on, you pansy!
Victory is mine.
We thank thee, Lord, that in thy--
-Come on, then.
-What?
Have at you.
You are brave, Sir Knight, but the fight is mine.
Had enough, eh?
Look, you stupid bastard.
You've got no arms left.
-Yes, l have.
-Look!
Just a flesh wound.
-Look, stop that.
-Chicken! l'll have your leg. Right!
-Right! l'll do you for that.
-You'll what?
-Come here.
-What are you going to do? Bleed on me?
-l am invincible!
-You're a loony.
The Black Knight always triumphs.
Have at you!
Come on, then.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
-Come, Patsy.
-Oh, l see.
Running away? You yellow bastard!
Come back here and take what's coming to you! l'll bite your legs off!

-A witch!
-We found a witch.
-We got a witch.
-We found a witch.
We've got a witch.
Burn her!
-We have found a witch. May we burn her?
-Burn her!
-How do you know she is a witch?
-She looks like one.
Bring her forward.
-l am not a witch.
-But you are dressed as one.
-They dressed me up like this.
-We didn't!
And this isn't my nose. lt's a false one.
-Well?
-Well, we did do the nose.
-The nose?
-And the hat. But she is a witch.
Burn her!
-Did you dress her up like this?
-No. Yes.
Yes, a bit. She has got a wart.
-What makes you think she is a witch?
-Well, she turned me into a newt.
A newt? l got better.
-Burn her anyway.
-Burn her!
Quiet! There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
-Are there? What are they? Tell us.
-Do they hurt?
Tell me: What do you do with witches?
Burn them!
-What do you burn apart from witches?
-More witches!
-Wood.
-So, why do witches burn?
-'Cause they're made of wood?
-Good.
So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?
-Build a bridge out of her.
-Can you not also make bridges of stone?
Oh, yeah.
Does wood sink in water?
-No.
-lt floats.
Throw her into the pond!
-What also floats in water?
-Bread.
-Apples.
-Very small rocks.
-Cider. Gravy. Cherries.
-Nuts.
-Churches.
-Lead.
A duck!
Exactly.
So, logically.... lf she...
...weighs the same as a duck...
...she's made of wood.
And, therefore....
-A witch!
-A witch!
We shall use my largest scales.
Right. Remove the supports!
-lt's a fair cop.
-Burn her!
Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of science?
-l am Arthur, King of the Britons.
-My liege.
Good Sir Knight, will you come to Camelot, and join us at the Round Table?
My liege, l would be honoured.
-What is your name?
-Bedevere, my liege.
Then l dub you, Sir Bedevere...
...knight of the Round Table.
The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights.
But other illustrious names were soon to follow.
Sir Lancelot the Brave.
Sir Galahad the Pure.
And Sir Robin, the Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot...
...who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor...
...who nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol...
...and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill.
And the aptly named
Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.
Together they formed a band...
...whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries.
The Knights of the Round Table.
That, my liege, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
This new learning amazes me,
Sir Bedevere.
Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
-Certainly, sir.
-Look, my liege.
-Camelot.
-Camelot.
-Camelot.
-lt's only a model.
Knights, l bid you welcome to your new home.
Let us ride to Camelot!
''We're knights of the Round Table
We dance whene'er we're able
''We do routines and chorus scenes
With footwork impeccable
''We dine well here in Camelot
We eat ham and jam and Spam a lot
''We're knights of the Round Table
Our shows are formidable
''But many times
We're given rhymes
''That are quite unsingable
We're opera mad in Camelot
''We sing from the diaphragm a lot
''ln war we're tough and able
''Quite indefatigable
''Between our quests
We sequin vests
''And impersonate Clark Gable lt's a busy life in Camelot
''l have to push the pram a lot''
No, on second thoughts, let's not go to Camelot. lt is a silly place.
Right.
Arthur.
King of the Britons.
Don't grovel. If there's one thing
I can't stand, it's people grovelling.
-Sorry.
-And don't apologize.
Every time I talk to someone it's
''sorry this,'' and, ''forgive me that''...
...and, ''I'm not worthy.''
-What are you doing now?
-l'm averting my eyes, O Lord.
Don't. It's like those miserable psalms.
They're so depressing.
-Now, knock it off!
-Yes, Lord.
Right. Arthur, King of the Britons.
Your knights of the Round Table shall have a task...
...to make them an example in these dark times.
-Good idea, O Lord!
-'Course it's a good idea.
Behold, Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.
Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek this grail.
That is your purpose, Arthur.
The quest for the Holy Grail.
-A blessing from the Lord.
-God be praised!
Halt!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello. Who is it? lt is King Arthur, and these are my knights of the Round Table.
Whose castle is this?
This is the castle of my master,
Guy de Loimbard.
Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God...
...with a sacred quest. lf he will give us food and shelter for the night...
...he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well, l'll ask him, but l don't think he'll be very keen.
He's already got one, you see.
-What?
-He says they've already got one!
-Are you sure he's got one?
-Oh, yes. lt's very nice. l told him we've already got one.
-Can we come up, and have a look?
-Of course not! You are English-types.
-Well, what are you then?
-l'm French.
Why do you think l have this outrageous accent, you silly king?
-What are you doing in England?
-Mind your own business. lf you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force.
You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!
Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person. l blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur King.
You and all your silly English knights.
-What a strange person.
-Now look here, my good man-- l don't want to talk to you no more...
...you empty-headed, animal food-trough wiper. l fart in your general direction.
Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries. ls there someone else up there we could talk to?
No. Now go away, or l shall taunt you a second time.
Now, this is your last chance. l've been more than reasonable....
-Fetchez la vache!
-Quoi?
Fetchez la vache! lf you do not agree to my commands, then l shall--
Jesus Christ!
Right! Charge!
Run away! Run away!
-Fiends! l'll tear them apart.
-No, no.
Sir, l have a plan, sir.
-Un cadeau.
-What?
-A present.
-Un cadeau.
Oui, allons-y. Let's go.
What happens now?
Well, now, Lancelot, Galahad, and l wait until nightfall...
...and then leap out of the rabbit, taking the French by surprise.
Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!
Who leaps out?
Lancelot, Galahad, and l...
...leap out of the rabbit.
Look. lf we built this large, wooden badger....
Run away!
-History for Schools. Take 8.
-Action!
Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur.
The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise.
Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required...
...if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion.
Arthur, having consulted his closest knights...
...decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually.
Now, this is what they did--
Frank!
The tale of Sir Robin.
So, each of the knights went their separate ways.
Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing...
...accompanied by his favourite minstrels.
''Bravely bold Sir Robin
Rode forth from Camelot
''He was not afraid to die
O, Brave Sir Robin
''He was not at all afraid
To be killed in nasty ways
''Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin
''He was not in the least bit scared
To be mashed into a pulp
''Or to have his eyes gouged out
And his elbows broken
''To have his kneecaps split
And his body burned away
''And his limbs all hacked and mangled
Brave Sir Robin
''His head smashed in
And his heart cut out
''His liver removed
And his bowels unplugged
''His nostrils raped, his bottom burned off
And his penis--''
That's enough music for now, lads.
Looks like there's dirty work afoot.
Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.
Dennis, forget about freedom.
Don't drop that mud.
Halt! Who art thou?
-''He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin--''
-Shut up!
Nobody, really. l was just passing through.
What do you want?
-''To fight and--''
-Shut up!
Nothing. Nothing, really.
-Just to pass through, good Sir Knight.
-I'm afraid not.
-Actually, l am a knight of the Round Table.
-You're a knight of the Round Table? l am.
-In that case, I have to kill you.
-Shall I?
-I don't think so.
-What do I think?
-Kill him.
-Let's be nice to him.
-Shut up.
-But--
And you!
Get the sword out.
I want to cut his head off!
-Cut your own head off.
-Yes, do us all a favour.
-What?
-Yapping on all the time.
-You're lucky you're not next to him.
-What do you mean?
-You snore.
-I don't.
-You've got bad breath.
-Only because you don't brush my teeth.
Stop bitching, and let's go and have tea!
All right! We'll kill him first, and then have tea and biscuits.
-Yes.
-Not biscuits.
All right! Not biscuits.
But let's kill him anyway.
Right.
-He's buggered off!
-So he has! He's scarpered.
-''Brave Sir Robin ran away''
-No!
-''Bravely ran away, away''
-l didn't.
''When danger reared its ugly head
He bravely turned his tail and fled
''Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about
And gallantly he chickened out
''Bravely taking to his feet
He beat a very brave retreat
-''Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin''
-l never!

The tale of Sir Galahad.
Open the door. ln the name of King Arthur, open the door!
Hello!
Welcome, gentle Sir Knight.
Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.
-The Castle Anthrax?
-Yes. lt's not a very good name, is it?
But we are nice, and we will attend to your every, every need!
You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
-The what?
-The Grail. lt is here?
But you are tired, and you must rest awhile.
Midget! Crapper!
-Yes, O Zoot?
-Prepare a bed for our guest.
-Thank you, Zoot.
-Thank you.
Away, away, varletesses!
The beds here are warm and soft, and very, very big.
-Look, l--
-What is your name, handsome knight?
Sir Galahad the Chaste.
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot.
-But come.
-Please, in God's name, show me the Grail.
You have suffered much. You are delirious.
-Look, l have seen it. lt is here.
-Sir Galahad!
You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality. l'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet, compared to yours.
We're 8 score blondes and brunettes, all between 16 and 19 and a half...
...cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us. lt is a lonely life.
Bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear.
We are just not used to handsome knights.
Nay. Come. You may lie here.
-But you are wounded!
-No, it's nothing!
You must see the doctors immediately.
Please, lie down.
-Well, what seems to be the trouble?
-They're doctors?
They have a basic medical training.
Come, come, you must try to rest.
Dr. Piglet! Dr. Winston! Practice your art.
-Try to relax.
-Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?
We must examine you.
-There's nothing wrong with that.
-Please. We are doctors.
Look, this cannot be.
-l am sworn to chastity!
-Back to your bed!
Torment me no longer. l have seen the Grail.
-There's no Grail here.
-l have seen it.
-l have seen--
-Hello.
Hello.
-Zoot!
-l am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.
-Where are you going?
-l seek the Grail. l have seen it here in this castle!
Oh, no. Bad, bad Zoot!
-What is it?
-Wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!
She has been setting light to our beacon, which is Grail-shaped. lt's not the first time we've had this problem. lt's not the real Grail?
Wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot.
She is a bad person, and must pay the penalty.
Do you think this scene should have been cut?
We were so worried when the boys were writing it.
But now we're glad. lt's better than some previous scenes, l think.
Ours was better visually.
Ours was committed. lt wasn't a string of pussy jokes.
-Get on with it.
-Yes. Get on with it!
Get on with it!
-l am enjoying this scene.
-Get on with it!
Wicked, wicked Zoot!
She must pay the penalty. ln Castle Anthrax, we have a punishment for setting alight the Grail-shaped beacon.
You must tie her down on a bed, and spank her.
A spanking! A spanking!
You must spank her, and after you've spanked her, deal with her as you like.
-And, then, spank me.
-And me!
-And me.
-And me.
Yes. You must give us all a good spanking!
A spanking!
-And, after the spanking, the oral sex.
-The oral sex!
Well, l could stay a bit longer.
-Sir Galahad!
-Hello.
-Quick! You are in great peril.
-Why?
-No, he isn't!
-Silence, foul temptress!
-She's got a point.
-We'll cover your escape!
-Look, l'm fine!
-Wait, Sir Galahad!
-l can tackle this lot single-handed!
-Yes, let him tackle us single-handed!
No, Sir Galahad. Come!
Honestly, l can handle this lot easily!
-Yes, let him handle us easily.
-No, sir. Quick!
Wait! Please! l can defeat them!
There's only 150 of them!
He'll beat us easily. We haven't a chance.
Oh, shit!
-You were in great peril.
-l don't think l was.
You were in terrible peril.
-Let me go back, and face the peril.
-No, it's too perilous. lt's my duty to sample as much peril as l can.
We've got to find the Holy Grail.
-Let me have just a bit of peril?
-No. lt's unhealthy.
-l bet you're gay.
-No, l'm not.
Sir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation.
But, they were still no nearer the Grail.
King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away...
...had discovered something.
That's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously.
They were more than two laden swallow's flights away.
Four, with a coconut on a line between them.
If the birds were--
Get on with it!
Oh, anyway...
...on to Scene 24, which is a smashing scene, with some lovely acting...
...in which Arthur discovers a vital clue.
There aren't any swallows, but I think you can hear a--
And this enchanter of whom you speak, he has seen the Grail?
Where does he live?
Old man, where does he live?
He knows of a cave.
A cave which no man has entered.
-And the Grail. The Grail is there?
-There is much danger.
For beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril...
...which no man has ever crossed.
But the Grail. Where is the Grail?
Seek you the Bridge of Death.
The Bridge of Death?
Which leads to the Grail?
-Who are you?
-We are the knights who say, ''Ni''!
-No! Not the knights who say ''Ni''?
-The same!
-Who are they?
-We are the keepers of the sacred words.
''Ni,'' ''Peng,'' and ''Neee Wom''!
Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale.
The knights who say, ''Ni'' demand a sacrifice.
Knights of Ni, we are but simple travellers...
...who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
Ni! Ni!
We shall say, ''Ni'' again to you, if you do not appease us.
-What is it you want?
-We want...
...a shrubbery.
A what?
-Ni! Ni!
-Please! No more!
-We will find you a shrubbery.
-You must return with a shrubbery...
...or else you will never pass through this wood...
...alive.
Knights of Ni, you are just and fair.
-We will return with a shrubbery.
-One that looks nice.
-Of course.
-And not too expensive.
-Yes.
-Now go!
Stop that! Stop that!
Go on, be off! Go away.
And you, be off!
Bloody weather.
The tale of Sir Lancelot.
One day, lad, all this will be yours.
-What, the curtains?
-No, not the curtains.
All that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys.
That'll be your kingdom, lad.
-But, Mother.
-Father, lad.
-But, Father, l don't want any of that.
-Listen, lad. l built this kingdom up from nothing.
When l started here, it was a swamp.
Other kings said l was daft to build a castle on the swamp.
But l built it all the same to show them. lt sank into the swamp.
So, l built a second one.
That sank into the swamp.
So, l built a third one. That burned down, fell over, then sank in the swamp.
But the fourth one stayed up.
And that's what you'll get, lad.
-The strongest castle in these isles.
-But l don't want any of that.
-l'd rather--
-Rather what? l'd rather just...
-...sing.
-Stop that.
You're not going into a song while l'm here! ln 20 minutes, you're marrying a girl...
...whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.
-But l don't want land.
-Listen, Alice.
-Herbert.
-Herbert.
We live on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
-But l don't like her.
-Don't like her?
What's wrong with her?
She's beautiful, she's rich.
She's got huge...
...tracts of land. l know, but l want the girl that l marry to have...
...a certain special something.
Cut that out!
You're marrying Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea!
Guards!
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave the room until l get him.
Not to leave the room, even if you come and get him.
No. Until l come and get him.
Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.
No, you stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
-And you'll come and get him.
-Right.
We don't need to do anything, apart from stop him entering the room.
-No. Leaving the room.
-Leaving the room, yes.
-All right?
-lf....
-lf we're--
-Yes?
Look, it's quite simple.
You stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
-All right?
-l remember.
Can he can he leave the room with us?
No, you just keep him in here, and make sure--
Yes! We'll keep him in here, obviously.
-But if he had to leave--
-No. Keep him in here!
-Until you, or anyone--
-Not anyone, just me.
-Just you....
-Get back.
-Right?
-Right.
We'll stay here until you get back.
-And make sure he doesn't leave.
-What?
-Make sure he doesn't leave.
-The Prince?
-Yes, make sure he doesn't leave.
-Yes, of course! l thought you meant him! lt seemed a bit daft me having to guard him when he's a guard.
-ls that clear?
-Quite clear. No problems.
Right.
-Where are you going?
-We're coming with you. l want you to stay here, and make sure he doesn't leave. l see, right.
-But, Father--
-Shut it, and get that suit on.
And no singing!
Go and get a glass of water.
-Well taken, Concorde!
-Thank you, sir, most kind.
And again!
Over we go! Good, steady!
Now, the big one!
Come on, Concorde!
Message for you, sir.
Concorde, speak to me!
''To whoever finds this note...
''...l have been imprisoned by my father...
''...who wishes me to marry against my will.
''Please, please come and rescue me.
''l am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle.''
At last! A call! A cry of distress!
This could be the sign that leads us to the Holy Grail!
Brave Concorde, you shall not have died in vain! l'm not quite dead, sir.
You shall not have been mortally wounded in vain! l think l could pull through, sir.
-l see.
-l think l'm all right to come with you.
No, sweet Concorde! Stay here. l will send help as soon as l have accomplished a daring and...
...heroic rescue in my own particular....
-ldiom, sir?
-ldiom!
-No, l feel fine, actually, sir.
-Farewell, sweet Concorde! l'll just stay here, shall l, sir?
Yeah.
Hey!
You're not allowed to enter the room--
Fair one, behold your servant,
Sir Lancelot of Camelot.
-l have come to take.... l'm terribly sorry.
-You got my note!
-l got a note.
-You've come to rescue me?
-Well, no, you see--
-l knew someone would. l knew that somewhere out there, there must be someone--
Stop that! Stop it!
Who are you?
-l'm your son.
-No, not you.
-l'm Sir Lancelot, sir.
-He's come to rescue me, Father.
-Let's not jump to conclusions.
-Did you kill all those guards?
Yes. Sorry.
-They cost 50 pounds each.
-l'm awfully sorry.
Don't be afraid of him, Sir Lancelot. l've got a rope ready.
You killed eight wedding guests and all!
Well, you see, l thought your son was a lady. l can understand that.
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot! Hurry!
-Shut up!
-You only killed the bride's father!
-l didn't mean to.
Didn't mean to?
You put your sword through his head!
-Oh dear, is he all right?
-You kicked the bride in the chest!
-lt's going to cost me a fortune!
-l can explain. l was in the forest, riding north from Camelot when l got this note.
-Are you from Camelot?
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot! l'm a knight of King Arthur, sir.
Very nice castle, Camelot.
Very good pig country.
-ls it?
-l am ready!
-Would you like to come have a drink?
-That's awfully nice of you.
-l am ready!
-l mean, to be so understanding.
You see, when l'm in this idiom, l sometimes get a bit carried away.
Now, this is the main hall.
We'll have all this knocked through--
-There he is!
-Bloody hell.
-Hold it, please!
-See what l mean? l get carried away. l'm really most awfully sorry.
Sorry, everyone.
He's killed the best man!
Hold it, please, hold it.
This is Sir Lancelot...
...from the Court of Camelot, a brave and influential knight.
-And my special guest here today.
-Hello.
He killed my auntie!
No, please!
This is supposed to be a happy occasion!
Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who.
We are here today to witness the union of two young people...
...in the joyful bond of holy wedlock.
Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert...
...has just fallen to his death.
But l don't want to think l've lost a son, so much as...
...gained a daughter.
For, since the tragic death of her father--
He's not quite dead!
Since the near fatal wounding of her father--
He's getting better!
For, since her own father...
...who, when he seemed about to recover...
...suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him.
He's died! l want his only daughter to look upon me...
...as her own dad, in a very real, and legally binding sense.
And l feel sure that the merger....
The union between the Princess...
...and the brave but dangerous
Sir Lancelot of Camelot--
-What?
-Look, the dead Prince!
-He's not quite dead!
-l feel much better.
You fell out of the tall tower, you creep!
-No, l was saved at the last minute.
-How? l'll tell you.
Not like that! Not like that.
''He's going tell
He's going to tell''
Quickly, sir, come this way!
No, it's not right for my idiom. l must escape more....
-Dramatically, sir?
-Dramatically.
Excuse me, could somebody give me a push, please?
Old crone! ls there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery?
-Who sent you?
-The knights who say, ''Ni''!
No! We have no shrubberies here. lf you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and l...
...will say....
We will say, ''Ni.''
Do your worst!
Very well. lf you will not assist us voluntarily...
-...Ni!
-No!
Never. No shrubberies.
-Ni!
-Noo!
No, it's not that, it's ''Ni.''
No, you're not doing it properly.
-Ni.
-You've got it.
-Ni!
-Ni!
Are you saying ''Ni'' to that old woman?
Yes.
What sad times are these when passing ruffians can say, ''Ni'' at will to old ladies.
There is a pestilence upon this land.
Nothing is sacred.
Even those who arrange shrubberies are under considerable economic stress...
...at this period in history.
-Did you say ''shrubberies''?
-Yes.
Shrubberies are my trade. l am a shrubber.
My name is Roger the Shrubber. l arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.
-Ni!
-No!
Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery.
-May we go?
-lt is a good shrubbery. l like the laurels particularly.
But there is one small problem.
What is that?
We are now no longer the knights who say ''Ni.''
We are now the knights who say:
''Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing''!
Therefore, we must give you a test.
What's is this test, knights who until recently said ''Ni''?
Firstly, you must find...
...another shrubbery!
Not another shrubbery!
Then you must bring it here beside this shrubbery.
Higher, so you get the two-level effect, a path going down the middle.
A path! A path!
Then, when you have found the shrubberies...
...you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest...
...with a herring!
-We shall do no such thing.
-Please.
Cut down a tree with a herring? lt can't be done.
-Don't say that word.
-What word? l cannot tell. Suffice to say...
...it's one of the words the knights of Ni cannot hear.
How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?
-He did it again.
-What? ''ls''?
You wouldn't get very far in life not saying ''is.''
My liege, it's Robin.
''He's jacking it in and packing it up
And sneaking away and buggering up
''And chickening out and pissing a pot
Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge''
-Robin.
-My liege. lt's good to see you.
You haven't given up your quest for the Holy Grail?
-''He is sneaking away and--''
-Shut up!
-No, far from it.
-You said the word again. l was looking for it here in this forest.
-No, it is far from this place.
-Stop saying the word!
-The word we cannot hear!
-Stop it!
-He said, ''it'' again!
-That's it! l've said, ''it.'' l've said, ''it.'' l've said, ''it'' again!
That's three ''its''!
And so Arthur and Bedevere and
Sir Robin set out on their search to find...
...the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in Scene 24.
Beyond the forest they met Lancelot and Galahad...
...and there was much rejoicing.
In the frozen land of Nador...
...they were forced to eat
Robin's minstrels.
And there was much rejoicing.
A year passed.
Winter changed into spring.
Spring changed into summer.
Summer changed back into winter...
...and winter gave spring and summer a miss and went straight on into autumn.
Until one day.
Knights...
...forward!
What manner of man are you, that can summon up fire...
-...without flint or tinder?
-l am an enchanter.
-By what name are you known?
-There are some who call me...
-...Tim.
-Greetings, Tim the enchanter!
Greetings, King Arthur.
-You know my name?
-l do.
You seek the Holy Grail.
That is our quest.
You know much that is hidden, Tim.
Quite.
Yes, we are looking for the Holy Grail.
-Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.
-Yes, it is.
-And so we're looking for it.
-Yes, we are.
-We have been for some time.
-Ages.
So, anything you could do to help would be...
...very...
-...helpful.
-Look, can you tell us where--
Fine, l don't want to waste any more of your time...
...but l don't suppose you could tell us where we might find a....
A what?
A grail?
Yes, l think so.
Yes.
Yes!
-Thank you.
-Splendid!
Look, you're a busy man--
Yes, l can help you find the Holy Grail.
To the north, there lies a cave.
The Cave of Caerbannog.
Wherein, carved in mystic runes, upon the very living rock...
...the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged...
...make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
-Where could we find this cave, Tim?
-Follow!
But follow only if ye be men of valour.
For the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature...
...so foul, so cruel...
...that no man yet has fought with it and lived.
Bones of full 50 men lie strewn about its lair. So, brave knights...
...if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further...
...for death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth.
What an eccentric performance!
They're nervous, sire.
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on, on foot.
Dismount!
Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!
-Right, keep me covered.
-What with?
-Just keep me covered.
-Too late.
There he is!
-Where?
-There.
-What, behind the rabbit?
-lt is the rabbit.
-You silly sod!
-What?
You got us all worked up.
That's no ordinary rabbit.
That's the most foul, cruel and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.
You tit! l soiled my armour l was so scared!
Look, that rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide.
-lt's a killer!
-Get stuffed.
-He'll do you up a treat, mate!
-Yeah?
-You manky Scots git!
-l'm warning you.
-What's he do? Nibble your bum?
-He's got huge, sharp.... lt can leap about....
-Look at the bones!
-Go on, Bors, chop its head off.
Right. Silly little bleeder.
One rabbit stew coming right up.
Look!
-Jesus Christ!
-l warned you!
-l've done it again.
-l warned you.
But did you listen to me?
No, you knew it all, didn't you? lt's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?
Well, it's always the same.
-l always--
-Shut up!
Charge!
Run away!
-How many did we lose?
-Gawain.
-Ector.
-And Bors. That's five.
-Three.
-Three.
We better not risk another frontal assault, that rabbit's dynamite.
Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?
-Shut up and change your armour.
-Let us taunt it. lt may become so cross, that it will make a mistake.
Like what?
Well....
-Have we got bows?
-No.
-We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
-Yes, of course!
The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. lt's one of the sacred relics
Brother Maynard carries.
Brother Maynard!
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade.
How does it....
How does it work?
-l know not, my liege.
-Consult the Book of Armaments.
Armaments 2: 9-21.
''And St. Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying:
'''O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade, that with it thou mayest...
'''...blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.'
''And the Lord did grin and the people did feast upon...
''...the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans...
''...and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and--''
Skip a bit, Brother.
''The Lord spake, saying,
'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin...
'''...then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.
'''Three shalt be the number thou shalt count...
'''...and the number of the counting shalt be three.
'''Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two...
'''...excepting that thou then proceed to three.
'''Five is right out.
'''Once the number three, being the third number be reached...
'''...then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch...
'''...towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight...
'''...shall snuff it.'''
Amen.
Amen.
Right.
One, two, five!
-Three, sir!
-Three!
There! Look!
What does it say? What language is that?
Brother Maynard, you're our scholar. lt is Aramaic!
Of course. Joseph of Arimathea!
-Of course.
-What does it say? lt reads, ''Here may be found...
''...the last words of Joseph of Arimathea:
'''He who is valiant and pure of spirit...
'''...may find the Holy Grail...
'''...in the Castle of Aaargh.'''
What?
''The Castle of Aaargh.''
What is that?
He must have died while carving it.
-Come on!
-That's what it says.
Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve ''Aaargh.''
-He'd just say it.
-That's what's carved in the rock.
-Perhaps he was dictating it.
-Shut up!
-Does it say anything else?
-No!
Just ''Aaargh.''
Aaargh.
Do you suppose he meant the Camargue?
-Where's that?
-ln France, l think.
-lsn't there a St. Aaargh's in Cornwall?
-No, that's St. lves.
St. lves.
No, ''Aaargh.'' At the back of the throat.
No, in surprise and alarm!
-You mean a sort of a ''Ah!''
-Yes, that's right.
My God! lt's the Legendary Black Beast of Aaargh!
That's it! Run away!
We've lost him.
As the horrendous Black Beast lunged foreard...
...escape for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless.
When, suddenly, the animator suffered a fatal heart attack.
The cartoon peril was no more.
The quest for the Holy Grail could continue.
There it is!
-The Bridge of Death.
-Great.
Look! There's the old man from Scene 24.
-What's he doing here?
-He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.
He asks each traveller five questions.
-Three questions.
-Three questions.
-He who answers the five questions--
-Three questions.
-Three questions, may cross in safety.
-What if you get a question wrong?
Then you are cast into the gorge of eternal peril.
-Oh, wacko.
-Who's going to answer the questions?
Brave Sir Robin, you go. l've got a great idea:
Why doesn't Lancelot go?
Yes, let me go, my liege. l will take him single-handed.
-l shall make a feint to the northeast....
-Hang on!
-Just answer the five questions--
-Three questions.
Three questions, as best you can.
And we shall watch and pray. l understand, my liege.
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot.
God be with you.
Stop!
Who would cross the Bridge of Death, must answer me these questions three.
Ere the other side he see.
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper. l'm not afraid.
-What is your name?
-My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.
What is your quest?
To seek the Holy Grail.
What is your favourite colour?
-Blue.
-Right. Off you go.
Well, thank you very much.
That's easy.
Stop.
Who approacheth the Bridge of Death, must answer me these questions three.
Ere the other side he see.
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper. l'm not afraid.
-What is your name?
-Sir Robin of Camelot.
-What is your quest?
-To seek the Holy Grail.
What is the capital of Assyria? l don't know that!
Stop!
-What is your name?
-Sir Galahad of Camelot.
-What is your quest?
-l seek the Grail.
-What is your favourite colour?
-Blue.
No! Yellow!
Stop!
-What is your name?
-lt is Arthur, King of the Britons.
-What is your quest?
-To seek the Holy Grail.
What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?
What do you mean?
An African or European swallow? l don't know that!
How do you know so much about swallows?
You have to know these things when you're a king.
Lancelot!
Lancelot!
Lancelot!
The Castle Aaargh. Our quest is at an end.
God be praised.
Almighty God...
...we thank thee, that thou hast vouchsafed to us the most holy--
Jesus Christ!
Dirty English knights.
Monsieur Arthur King, who has the brain of a duck.
So, we French fellows outwit you a second time.
How dare you profane this place with your presence? l command you, in the name of the knights of Camelot...
...to open the doors of this sacred castle...
...to which God himself has guided us.
How you English say? l'll unclog my nose in your direction.
Sons of a window-dresser!
So, you think you could out-clever us French folk...
...with your silly knees-bent, running about, advancing behaviour. l wave my private parts at your aunties.
You cheesy lot of second-hand, electric donkey-bottom biters! ln the name of the Lord...
...we demand entrance to this sacred castle!
No chance, English bed-wetting types. l burst my pimples at you, and call your door-opening request a silly thing!
You tiny-brained wipers of other people's bottoms. lf you'll not open this door, we shall take this castle by force! ln the name of God and the glory of our--
Right! That settles it!
Depart at this time, and don't be approaching any more...
...or we fire arrows into your heads, and make castanets out of your testicles.
Walk away, just ignore them.
And now remain gone, illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!
And, if you think you got a nasty taunting this time, you ain't heard...
...nothing yet, dirty English knights!
-We shall attack at once.
-Yes, my liege.
Stand by for attack!
French persons!
Today the blood of many a valiant knight shall be avenged. ln the name of God, we shall not stop our fight...
...till each one of you lies dead, and the Holy Grail...
...returns to those whom God has chosen.
Charge!
Yes, they're the ones, l'm sure.
-Come on.
-Put this man in the van.
-Put him in the van.
-Get a blanket over that one.
Come on, back! Right back!
That's an offensive weapon, that is.
All right, sonny, that's enough.
Pack that in.
Where is he?
I shan't ask you politely next time.
Where is Blofeld?
Cai... Cai...
Cairo!
Cards.
Hit me.
One chance.
Where can I find him?
Marie...
Ask Marie.
Who are you?
My name is Bond. James Bond.
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.
There is something I'd like you to get off your chest.
Where is Ernst Stavro Blofeld?
Speak up, darling. I can't hear you.
We now come to phase four: The nose.
In my opinion, the most difficult part of a plastic transformation.
I want the operation done tonight.
- But, señor...
- There's no time left.
But, Señor Blofeld, this is a most delicate procedure.
Tonight!
Keep the temperature at precisely 80 degrees.
Making mud pies, 007?
He would have been me in a matter of days if you'd given the poor fellow a chance.
Such a pity. I was dying to see how the operation turned out.
Get his gun.
Hold it! Get your hands up.
Kill him!
Welcome to hell, Blofeld.
Star of South Africa.
83.5 carats rough.
47.5 carats cut.
The Akbar Shah. 116 carats rough.
Are you paying attention, 007?
The Akbar Shah, 116 carats rough.
But surely, sir, there's no need to bring in our section on a relatively simple smuggling matter.
Sir Donald has convinced the PM otherwise.
May I remind you, 007, that Blofeld's dead.
Finished!
The least we can expect from you now is a little plain, solid work.
Good morning, gentlemen.
- Sir Donald will see you now.
- Thank you.
Good morning, Sir Donald.
- This is Commander Bond.
- How do you do? Please sit down.
- Sherry?
- Not for me, thanks. Doctor's orders.
- Commander Bond?
- Yes, thank you.
You've been on holiday, I understand.
Relaxing, I hope.
Hardly relaxing but... most satisfying.
Cheers.
Pity about your liver, sir.
It's an unusually fine Solera.
- '51, I believe.
- There is no year for sherry, 007.
I was referring to the original vintage on which the sherry is based, sir.
Unmistakable.
Precisely.
Tell me, Commander.
How far does your expertise extend into the field of diamonds?
Hardest substance found in nature.
They cut glass. Suggest marriage.
They've replaced a dog as a girl's best friend. That's about it.
Refreshing to hear there's one subject you're not an expert on.
Perhaps I'd better give you a brief background into our problem.
Eighty per cent of the world's diamonds come from mines in South Africa.
Most are dug out of shafts of diamond-bearing clay at depths of up to 3,000 feet.
The whole process, from start to finish, is subject to an airtight security system.
It's an essential precaution, though the industry prides itself on the loyalty and devotion of its workers.
Naturally the security measures tend to ensure that loyalty, as do the extensive amenities and social services we provide.
There's a permanent staff of doctors, nurses, even dentists.
The whole process, from start to finish, is subject to an airtight security system.
It's a necessary precaution, though the industry prides itself on the loyalty and devotion of its workers.
Next!
The scorpion.
Mother nature's finest killer, Mr. Wint.
One is never too old to learn from a master, Mr. Kidd.
Dr. Tynan? Good evening.
Who are you? And where is Joe?
Joe couldn't make it tonight.
I'm Mr. Wint.
This is Mr. Kidd.
I see.
What's the matter with him?
It's my wisdom teeth.
I haven't had 'em out yet.
Would you mind having a look, Doctor?
Of course.
I'm not going to hurt you. Just open.
No, no. Open wide.
Curious how everyone who touches those diamonds seems to... die.
- Stop right there! Who are you?
- Dr. Tynan sent us.
- Why didn't he come himself?
- He was taken sick.
Bitten by the bug.
He sent this for you.
If God had wanted man to fly...
He would have given him wings, Mr. Kidd.
No security system is perfect.
We've always accepted a percentage of smuggling.
But over the past two years, despite all our precautions, it's gone up alarmingly.
And none of the stones have reached the market.
Sir Donald thinks someone's stockpiling.
Our concern is that someone might dump them on the market to depress prices or...
Make you agree to perpetual blackmail.
Exactly.
What we need to know is who the stockpilers are.
The letter U is for umbrella.
We take it lest it rain.
We hope we shan't want it till we're home again.
Two men to see you, missy.
Gentlemen, Joshua.
I shan't be long, children.
Joshua is going to read you a story.
How nice to see you again!
- Where to this time?
- Amsterdam.
Amsterdam! Oh, how lovely!
I shall have to bring back some pictures of the canals for the children.
Ask, and ye shall receive, Mrs. Whistler.
Thus endeth the lesson for today, gentlemen.
Several recent murders in South Africa have complicated matters.
If they shut down operations before we discover them...
It would be catastrophic for us and for the government.
- I've always fancied a trip to South Africa.
- You're going to Holland.
For some time we've had our eyes on a smuggler - Peter Franks.
He's due to leave for Amsterdam.
Do we know who his contacts are?
We do function in your absence, Commander.
Passport, sir?
Mr. Franks. There's a message for you at Passport Control.
That door over there.
You can park outside.
Thank you.
Mr. Franks...
Your passport is quite in order.
Anyone seeing you in that outfit, Moneypenny, would certainly be discouraged from leaving the country.
What can I bring you back from Holland?
A diamond?
In a ring?
Would you settle for a tulip?
Yes.
Ahead is one of the oldest bridges in Amsterdam.
The Skinny Bridge.
It was built over 300 years ago by two sisters who wanted to visit each other every day.
Unfortunately they ran out of money. So that is why it is called the Skinny Bridge.
On your right, those beautiful old houses can be seen in the paintings of our famous painter, Rembrandt.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, if you will look to your left as we go down the Amstel, you can see...
Mrs. Whistler did want some pictures of the canals for the children.
How kind of you, Mr. Kidd.
The children will be so thrilled.
Yes?
Franks. Peter Franks.
Come up. Third floor.
Make yourself at home!
I'll be out in a minute!
Help yourself to a drink!
Is Mr. Case not at home?
There is no Mr. Case. The T is for Tiffany.
Tiffany Case?
Definitely distinctive.
I was born there, on the first floor, while my mother was looking for a wedding ring.
I'm glad for your sake it wasn't Van Cleef and Arpels.
Weren't you a blonde when I came in?
Could be.
I tend to notice little things like that.
Whether a girl is a blonde or a brunette.
And which do you prefer?
Providing the collars and cuffs match...
We'll talk about that later.
Let me have your glass.
I'll get you some ice.
That's quite a nice little nothing you're almost wearing. I approve.
I don't dress for the hired help.
Let's see your passport, Franks.
Occupation: Transport consultant?
That's a little cute, isn't it?
- I'll finish dressing.
- Please don't. Not on my account.
I don't care much for redheads.
Terrible tempers.
But somehow it seems to suit you.
It's my own.
But it is in need of some soft lighting.
- I know a little restaurant...
- I never mix business with pleasure.
- Neither do I.
- Good!
Then save the cute remarks until after you get the diamonds into Los Angeles.
- Where are they now?
- That's not your problem.
Your problem is getting them in.
- How much is there?
- 50,000 carats.
At 142 carats an ounce, that's an awful lot of ice. That won't be easy.
That's why you're being paid 50 grand.
What did you think it was going to be?
A pair of earrings?
And, Franks, for God's sakes, come up with something original.
I've got to hand it to you, Q.
Quite ingenious.
An obvious little notion.
Thought it might come in handy.
M's been trying to get in touch with you.
That Peter Franks fellow's escaped.
Killed one of the guards on the way up to London.
Hello?
Hello!
Are you there?
- Yes?
- Peter Franks.
Third floor.
- Guten Abend.
- Good evening.
Bitte.
- You are English?
- Yes, I'm English.
I speak English.
- Who is... your floor?
- Three, please.
Is he dead?
I sincerely hope so.
- Who is he?
- No idea.
This chap's been following me all day today.
My God!
You've just killed James Bond!
Is that who it was?
It just proves no one's indestructible.
You don't kill James Bond and wait around for the cops to arrive!
We've got to get those diamonds out of here fast!
Where are they?
A little old lady dropped them by yesterday morning.
Priceless.
I think we ought to let Mr. Bond carry the load from here on out.
It's funny.
All the things one wanted to say to one's brother... when it's all too late.
Let me assure you of our deepest condolences.
Would you please board the aircraft?
- We were inseparable, you know.
- Please, Mr. Franks.
Lufthansa announce the departure of flight LH450 to Los Angeles.
Please fasten your seat belts, and no smoking until airborne.
Thank you.
They're both aboard. I must say,
Miss Case seems quite attractive.
For a lady.
Lufthansa announce the arrival of flight LH450 from Amsterdam...
- Mr. Franks?
- Yes.
Follow me to Customs, please.
Peter Franks, Jerry.
Get some lunch, Jerry. I'll take over.
Death certificate, please, Mr. Franks.
Well, well, well!
Felix Leiter, you old fraud.
On behalf of the CIA, welcome to America.
Someone sent their brain trust down to meet you.
I give up. I know the diamonds are in the body, but where?
Alimentary, Dr. Leiter.
So long, James. Keep in touch.
The rest of your luggage has been cleared, Mr. Franks. OK, fellas!
You wanna sit in the front, Mr. Franks?
It's a lot smoother ride in the front, Mr. Franks.
Yes, I believe I'll sit in front.
The stiff - deceased back there.
Your brother, Mr. Franks?
Yes, it was.
I got a brudder.
Small world.
Mr. Franks, I'm Morton Slumber.
Please accept my heartfelt condolences at this most difficult hour.
He is heading for a better world, Mr. Slumber.
There is some consolation in that.
Now then, if we're ready to begin the final journey...
May his soul rest in peace.
Oh, yes. Amen.
If you'd come into my comfortable office, we will bring you the urn.
I'm so happy you chose our half-couch, hinged-panel, slumber-on casket.
I'm sure your brother would have appreciated it.
I'm sure he did.
Please, be seated.
Ashes to ashes...
- Dust to dust.
- Exactly.
At a moment like this, I'm sure you'd rather be left alone, for reflection.
Most thoughtful.
We've selected a private niche for your brother in our Garden of Remembrance.
The one with the restful chartreuse curtains and Angel's Breath gold trim.
I hope you'll find everything in order.
The arrangements have been impeccable so far.
Very... moving.
Heart-warming, Mr. Wint.
A glowing tribute, Mr. Kidd.
You dirty, double-crossin' limey fink!
Those goddamn diamonds are phonies!
No, don't tell me. You're St. Peter?
Paste! Glass!
Where's the real stuff, Franks?
Where's the real money? You wouldn't burn 50,000 real dollars, would you?
One last break.
Where are the real diamonds?
You get me the real money and I'll bring you the real diamonds.
Where do you think you're goin'?
I hear that the Hotel Tropicana is quite comfortable.
My condolences, gentlemen.
Hello, Felix.
Very comfortable.
But there's one problem.
I want the real merchandise - rather quickly.
Q has just arrived with it.
We'll be up with them in the morning.
So I'd sit tight if I were you.
There's no sense in looking for trouble.
Just enjoy yourself, James.
I'm sure you know how.
Quite. I'll probably take in a show.
How do you like me so far?
People say I have the body of Rock Hudson.
If he ever finds out what I'm doin' to it, he'll be madder than hell.
I call these girls my Acorns.
Actually, they're a gift from Willard Whyte, who is upstairs right now playing Monopoly with real buildings.
Tryin' to find Willard Whyte is like tryin' to find a virgin in a maternity ward.
On behalf of the Whyte House,
I wanna let you folks know you've been a lousy audience.
So get lost. See ya later.
Shady Tree!
- Shady, we just adored your act!
- What taste, style!
And we have a few suggestions.
Critics and material I don't need!
I haven't changed my act in 40 years.
Hold it! Don't go in there.
We didn't get the real diamonds, so we need Tree - alive.
That's most annoying.
- Get down there!
- Crap. Boxcar, the loser.
That's it, pussycat.
I shot the whole wad.
What do you say? Back to my place?
You're a nice person, Maxie.
Really, you are.
Why don't you go and take a nap?
And I'll see you next year.
May I have $5,000? No, make it $10,000.
$2,000 limit.
Is there some problem?
Mr. Saxby.
Gentleman wants $10,000 credit with a $2,000 limit.
My name is Franks.
Peter Franks.
Mr. Franks' credit's good.
- Good luck to you, Mr. Franks.
- Thank you. I'll have two stacks now.
Give the gentleman 4,000.
Thank you.
Hi! I'm Plenty.
- But of course you are.
- Plenty O'Toole.
Named after your father, perhaps?
Would you like some help?
On the craps, I mean.
That's very kind of you.
Coming out. Coming out.
Next shooter is a lady.
Ladies are lucky. For the lady.
Nine. Mark nine.
Seven, loser. The lucky lady craps out.
New shooter. Your shot, Mr. F.
- Willard Whyte speakin'.
- Tree is dead. Turn on number two.
It's Peter Franks.
Hard ten. Ten's the number.
I'll take the full odds on the ten.
200 on the hard way.
The limit on all the numbers,
250 on the eleven. Thank you very much.
Say! You've played this game before!
Just once.
- Now what do we do?
- Don't bother me with details, Bert!
Just get me the diamonds!
You handle those cubes like a monkey handles coconuts.
Thank you, gentlemen, for such a sterling service.
That's 50,000 dollars!
Minus $5,000 for you... leaves me
$45,000, and thank you very much.
It was nothing, really!
You know something, Peter Franks?
You're a terrific guy!
A little weird, but a terrific guy!
Why don't we go someplace and have a drink?
A drink?
If you'd like to come in, Plenty.
How pretty!
What a super place you have!
Just give me one second, lover.
Good evening.
I'm afraid you've caught me with more than my hands up.
What the hell is this?!
A perverts' convention or something?!
You can't do this to me!
Stop that! I've got friends in this town!
Exceptionally fine shot.
I didn't know there was a pool down there.
Let's get down to business.
I presume you've come for the real...
The real diamonds.
Good evening, Miss Case.
Sorry about your fulsome friend.
I'll bet you really missed something.
The evening may not be a total loss after all.
Why don't we talk a bit first?
First?
What would you like to talk about?
You pick a subject.
- Diamonds?
- Good boy!
And you want to know where they are, and whether I'm working alone or not.
So far, so good. Keep going.
And if not, then with whom.
So you can inform your superiors and... acquire the diamonds.
Peter!
I'm very impressed.
There's a lot more to you than I had expected.
Presumably I'm the condemned man, and obviously you're the hearty breakfast.
Right?
You're not going to tell me where the diamonds are, are you?
What diamonds?
Sooner or later you'll have to talk.
They'll make you.
At the very least, you'll never get out of town alive.
I can solve that little problem.
It's lucky for me that I ran into you.
Fifty-fifty split.
You get the diamonds, I get us out.
Us?
I can't very well help you and then stick around.
We could be on a plane and out of the country by tomorrow night.
Rio... Hong Kong...
I know a good tailor in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong.
All right. I'll get the diamonds, you get the plane tickets.
No. The airport's too obvious.
A rented car should do us fine for openers.
That's good thinking.
And since you're the one being watched,
I'll get the diamonds, you get the car.
That's very good thinking.
Oh, Peter!
I have a feeling this is the beginning of a wonderful relationship.
Darling...
Where do I pick up the diamonds?
When was the last time you visited a circus?
Circus Circus proudly presents the Flying Palacios!
- She's in the building.
- Right. Stand by.
James, next time, pick a contact point when you're standing up.
- Felix, if she gives your men the slip...
- Relax. I have 30 agents down there.
A mouse with sneakers on couldn't get through.
Give Maxwell his cue.
This is Quarterback.
Operation Passover, commence.
Quarterback to Tight End.
Operation Passover, commence.
Roger.
She's on her way. So far, so good.
- Good luck, Felix. I'll see you later.
- Where are you going?
The car rental agency.
Our little rendezvous?
You don't actually think she'll show up?
That's a thousand-to-one shot.
No, more like even money.
Her devotion to larceny versus my... incomparable charm.
All right, kiddies!
Ready? Aim! Fire!
What did I tell you?
Didn't I promise you a winner every time?
There you are, young man.
Boys and girls, here we go again.
All you have to do is just take your gun...
Here we have a little lady, here we have a little man, and here we have a big lady.
You're a little out of your league, aren't ya, sister?
Point the gun. You know what to do.
All ready? Get set.
Now hold it till I say go.
Go!
Come on! That's it!
Everybody point right at the clown.
A winner every time!
There we are! All right!
That's the way to do it!
Look at that!
And we have another winner!
Annie Oakley on the end!
Here we are. What an eye! What an eye!
Wait a second!
I saw the whole thing!
The machine's fixed!
Who's she - your mother?
Blow up your pants!
One win! She only had one win!
You're supposed to have 24 to win that dog!
Will you give it a rest, kid?
All right, boys and girls! Here we go!
Here for the first time, see Zambora, strangest girl ever born to live.
She was captured near Nairobi, south Africa, and is believed to be part of a cruel, inhuman experiment.
This beautiful girl will be locked into a steel cage, will change very slowly into a ferocious 450-pound gorilla.
Please be very still, ladies and gentlemen.
We must have absolute silence so we wouldn't disturb Zambora from her transcendental state.
We must warn you that in every scientific experiment there's always a danger.
So keep in mind those curtains is an exit.
God forbid something should go wrong over here, get outta here!
Now we start the transformation.
Very dangerous. Very quiet, please.
Wake, my beauty, wake!
Hey, lady, not through there.
The other way.
Come on!
- No show?
- Felix, don't tell me you lost her?
We lost her.
Nice place you have here.
Take something off. Enjoy the sun.
You've got a lot of guts showing up here!
Letting me freeze my behind off at a blackjack table for two hours waiting for some nonexistent diamonds!
And what the hell is my black wig doing in the pool?!
- She's...
- Dead.
Supposed to be you.
The next link in the pipeline.
What are you talking about?
Poor Plenty must have stumbled in here looking for you.
I don't believe you.
A dentist is dead in South Africa.
That little old lady in Amsterdam.
Shady got his last night.
They've missed me once.
And you're next.
- Now, who's your connection?
- You sound like a cop...
- Who's your connection?
- All I know is voices on a phone.
They got me this place and told me to wait for further instructions.
You'd find it difficult to hear under water.
- Now, where's the stuff?
- Who are you?
You're not a cop and you're not Peter Franks.
You're not the type to turn the other cheek. Where is it?
Eastern Airlines announce the arrival of flight 112 from Los Angeles, gate 7.
Thank you.
Fill it up, please.
It's Bert Saxby.
Willard Whyte's right-hand man.
Do you see the top? The penthouse?
They say Willard Whyte hasn't set foot out of there in three years.
And no one has seen him - no one.
- How much is that?
- Did you pay for this?
Cut him off.
Hey, Curly! What about my stamps?
Where are you going?
Are you mad? Let me by!
Stamps? You ain't got no gas yet!
- OK, so shove a coupla gallons in!
- Well, back it up.
Keep leaning on that tooter, Charlie, and you'll get a shot in the mouth!
Come on, lady, move it!
OK, lady, you win, you win.
- Will someone move that car?!
- Do what he says!
Hey! I wanted high-test!
Forget it, Curly!
You had your chance and you blew it!
OK, Professor.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- I haven't seen you here before.
- I'm Klaus Hergersheimer.
- New here?
- I've been here three years. G Section.
How are things in G Section?
Still the same old grind. You know.
Checking radiation shields for replacement.
By the way, where's yours?
I've been waiting a couple of days for you guys to deliver them.
Gee, I'm sorry. You should have given us a phone call.
Look, I've got one here.
Lucky for you, I carry spares.
You keep that on. You can't be too careful about radiation.
Absolutely. I feel much safer with this on.
See you around.
Who are you? What do you want?
Klaus Hergersheimer. G Section.
Just... checking on radiation shields.
Now let me see. You are...?
Professor Dr. Metz. Our shields are fine!
Now get out!
I'm sorry. It won't take a moment but
I must verify.
Metz. How do you spell it?
M- E... Will you please leave, you irritating man?
Doctor, there's no reason to run down the little people.
G Section may not be as important to the operation as you are, but we do have our orders.
Dr. Metz... Willard Whyte for you.
Right. Out, out.
Hello, WW.
Yes, it's finally here.
Quite enough for completion.
We'll be through shortly.
No. No problems at all.
Right.
- Now will you get out of here?!
- Certainly, Doctor.
I've seen everything I need to see.
Thank you very much.
Hi. Sorry to bother you.
I'm Klaus Hergersheimer.
G Section.
Checking radiation shields?
There he is! Behind the rock! Come on!
What is this? Amateur night?
Stop him, Harry!
Get him off that machine. That isn't a toy.
Get out of that moon buggy!
It's gone berserk!
Hey, what do you think you're doin'?!
That way!
- What happened? The diamonds...
- Get in the car!
If you see a mad professor in a minibus, just smile!
Fred, get the sheriff's office.
Drop me off at the next corner.
This is getting out of hand.
When you start stealing moon machines from Willard Whyte, goodbye and good luck!
Just relax. I have a friend named Felix who can fix anything.
Is he married?
There goes that son-of-a-bitchin' saboteur!
Relax! You've got a friend named Felix who can fix anything.
Unfortunately, so can Willard Whyte.
Why, you dirty...
Come in, Larry. Larry?
Larry?
Did you get him, Larry?
I think Larry got him.
- Sheriff...
- Attaboy, Larry.
Come in. Larry?
Sheriff...
I got you now.
Lean over.
Darling...
Why are we suddenly staying in the bridal suite of the Whyte House?
In order to form a more perfect union, sweetheart.
James...
May I finally call you James?
What's going to happen to me?
You did talk to your friend Felix about me?
What did he say?
Something about 20 years to life.
Nothing important.
- 20 years to life?!
- Relax, darling.
I'm on top of the situation.
Mr. and Mrs. Jones?
Yes, that's the name on the register, Mr. Leiter.
- What's the score with WW?
- Washington says no go.
- We sit still for now.
- Sit still?
And Miss Tiffany Case "Jones" has a lifetime reservation at another hotel.
The kind the government... runs.
I'm cooperating, Mr. Leiter.
Really I am.
I can vouch for that.
Felix, this is not the real White House, and he's not the president.
- Why don't we go and see him?
- The president I can get you in to see.
But until Washington believes
Whyte's a thief, that's the way it is.
In the meantime, I'm sure you and "Mrs. Jones" can find some way to amuse yourselves.
And just to make sure you're not disturbed, I have a man upstairs.
And Hamilton... is right out here.
So long, James.
- Well, that's a switch!
- What's that?
The wolf being guarded by the three little pigs.
I won't be long, darling.
Where are you going?
I'm just popping upstairs for a moment.
- Sixteenth floor?
- No, lady. Starlight Lounge only.
OK, folks. Stand clear of the doors. Here we go.
Starlight Lounge to the left.
Express to street level only, folks.
OK. Stand clear of the doors. Here we go.
Howdy, son. We've been expectin' you.
You got any personal business to take care of in there, you go right ahead.
First, I suspect you're wearin' a hog leg.
Would you mind standin' up and takin' it off?
Isn't that nice?
You are a pleasant fella.
Why don't you just come on in, son?
Relax. Make yourself comfortable.
That's good. Right on over there.
Good evening, Mr. Bond.
Blofeld.
Good evening, 007.
Double jeopardy, Mr. Bond.
You killed my only other double,
I'm afraid.
After his death, volunteers were
- understandably - rather scarce.
Such a pity. All that time and expense simply to provide you with one mock-heroic moment.
Willard Whyte speakin'.
Yes, Governor. I got your message.
No, I'm afraid a personal appearance is quite out of the question.
I'll send a deposition to the committee.
Thank you, Governor.
Well, that's a neat trick.
A voice box, Mr. Bond.
Science was never my strong suit, but the principle is easy enough.
Someone's voice patterns and resonance stored in a small oral-signature tape.
And a miniature, transistorized version is installed in his neck.
Or is it his neck? I never can remember.
Anyway, no matter. We both sound alike.
My congratulations to you both.
Nice little company.
Explosives, oil, electronics, houses, aviation.
I've done rather well with it, too.
Tried to cut some of the fat off, but Mr. Whyte's a splendid administrator.
Damn thing runs itself.
I suppose you killed him.
Nothing so melodramatic.
I'm simply holding him in cold storage, so to speak.
An insurance policy against any outside interference with my plans.
The ideal kidnap victim.
No one's seen the man for five years.
Who'd miss someone who's already missing?
How clever you are, Mr. Bond.
Nice to see you haven't lost that fine mental edge, 007.
Please don't get any foolish notions.
That missile is not a practical weapon.
Well, it's hardly worth the effort.
After all, I wouldn't know which one of you to kill.
We appreciate your predicament, Mr. Bond.
We deeply sympathize.
Right idea, Mr. Bond.
But wrong pussy.
I do so enjoy our little visits, Mr. Bond.
However potentially painful they may be.
But I'm afraid this one has come to an end.
What do you intend to do with those diamonds?
An excellent question.
And one which will be hanging on the lips of the world quite soon.
If I were to break the news to anyone, it would be to you first. You know that.
But it's late, I'm tired, and there's so much left to do.
Good night, Mr. Bond.
Well, go on, go on. It's merely a lift.
Or perhaps I should say "elevator".
In any event, I'm sure you'll find it much more convenient than mountaineering about outside the Whyte House.
You press L, Mr. Bond.
The word "lobby" begins with L.
If at first you don't succeed, Mr. Kidd...
Try, try again, Mr. Wint.
One of us smells like a tart's handkerchief.
I'm afraid it's me.
Sorry about that, old boy.
I don't mind the cockamamie machine breaking down twice a day.
But why the hell does it always have to be
500 yards away from the nearest hatch?
All right, Charlie.
It's your turn to play hunchback.
Thank you very much.
I was just out walking my rat and I seem to have lost my way.
Willard Whyte speakin'.
This is Bert.
We got a problem.
What's wrong with your voice?
Got a cold?
Never mind about that.
I just saw James Bond in the casino.
- That's impossible.
- Come and see for yourself.
Hey, listen.
If he's half the genius they say he is, we're in for real trouble.
- Calm down, Bert.
- It's a cinch he's not working alone.
This place must be crawling with agents by now.
- I think we should move Willard Whyte.
- Nonsense.
Mr. Whyte is perfectly safe at his own summerhouse.
It's on the ridge, about ten miles out of town.
I'm a little surprised, Bert.
It's not like you to panic.
I just don't enjoy messing around with a guy as tough as James Bond.
Never mind James Bond.
You get down to that house.
I'm afraid Mr. Whyte has suddenly outgrown his usefulness.
- Do it cleanly, Bert.
- Don't worry.
Just leave everything to me.
That ridiculous contraption actually seems to work, Q.
You've surpassed yourself this time.
Not a bit of it. Made one of these for the kids last Christmas.
Maxwell, James and I will head for the house.
Get set to hit the penthouse as soon as we find Whyte.
Let me speak to Metz.
There's been a change.
Push all plans forward by 24 hours.
I'm joining you immediately.
Give me five minutes to get up there and five minutes to find Whyte.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Ask me again in ten minutes' time.
Tell Maxwell to stand by to hit the penthouse.
Well, hi there!
I'm Bambi.
Good morning... Bambi.
And I'm Thumper.
Is there something we can do for you?
I can think of several things offhand but at the moment
I'm looking for Willard Whyte.
Oh, Willie.
Why, he's right out there.
And that's all there is to it?
Not quite.
First... we're gonna have a ball.
All yours, Bambi!
You're on again, Bambi!
Thumper...
Hello, Felix.
Willard Whyte is about to be executed, and guess who's giving breaststroke lessons.
- Where the hell is Whyte?
- I haven't found out yet.
Still haven't found out.
Right!
FBI?
- CIA?
- No.
British Intelligence, Mr. Whyte.
James Bond.
I see you've met my friends,
Bambi and Thumper.
Yes, we did have a bit of a chat.
What the hell's happened to me and what can I do about it?
Let's get out of here first and I'll explain it to you en route.
Tell Maxwell to hit the penthouse...
Saxby.
- Bert Saxby?!
- Yeah.
Tell him he's fired.
Hi there, Mr. Q. Are you having any luck?
I'm being somewhat successful, thank you.
Listen, Mr. Q. I... I was wondering.
Have you heard any talk about me from Felix or James?
No, I'm afraid not.
I guess I'm working for the good guys now, but I'm two steps away from the slammer if they want me there.
I thought... you might be able to put in a good word.
That's unbelievable!
An electromagnetic RPM controller.
Been aching to give it a try. You see, pressure on the case when the desired symbols appear causes the rotation of the cylinders to stutter at the precise moment needed to...
Cab, lady?
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.
I'm delighted to meet you, Miss Case.
I'd so dreaded the prospect of making this tedious journey alone.
This way, Mr. Whyte.
It was right here.
About six feet high, with a solar panel.
- It had these aerofoils that seemed to...
- Draw it for me.
Was Dr. Metz on your payroll, Mr. Whyte?
No. But I heard of him.
Everybody in our business has.
The world's leading expert on laser refraction.
A committed idealist to peace.
And how in the hell Blofeld got his hooks in him, I will never know!
How did he get security clearance to work here in the first place?
From you, sir. I talked to you personally about it.
I even recognized your voice just now.
I'm sure I must've told you not to keep the usual duplicate microfilm records of the project.
Exactly, sir.
Tom, what did I tell you to do with this?
Send it to Vandenberg, sir.
Well, get 'em on the phone - now!
Yeah?
You won't believe this.
- Willard Whyte for you!
- Wow.
- This is a real honor, sir.
- Shove your honor!
- Where's that satellite I sent down there?
- Blasted off 24 minutes ago, sir.
Perfect trajectory. All systems go.
We expect to enter orbit right on the nose.
- Wait. Something's happened.
- Just a moment.
The scanners have gone crazy.
- Premature first-stage separation!
- It doesn't make sense!
Stand by to abort!
We can't control it, sir.
Abort it!
It's negative.
We can't. Something's taken over the guidance system!
It's as if it had a will of its own.
And there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
We're working on it.
I'll call you back, Mr. Whyte.
Whatever it is, your friend Blofeld's controllin' it now.
A vast supply of diamonds manipulated by an expert in light refraction.
The first laser beam was generated through a diamond.
And if old Metz deserves his reputation, the power of that thing could be incredible.
And Blofeld's got it.
- Where is it now?
- Approaching North Dakota.
Alert Strategic Air Command.
Gimme an open line to SAC.
Attention all personnel.
Attention all personnel.
We have a red alert. Stand by for emergency procedure.
Willard Whyte.
Yes, General.
One of our missiles just "accidentally" blew up in North Dakota.
Whatever's happenin',
Mr. Bond, has started.
- Is this your herd?
- Mr. Whyte, phone call from Washington.
- Urgent.
- I'll catch it in the john.
- What about Blofeld?
- Not a trace.
We found a tunnel. We'll check it out.
- Where's Tiffany?
- Do you mind if we find Blofeld first?
Come on! Let's hit that tunnel!
Washington just got word from your friend with the cat.
Would you believe that this whole damn country is bein' held for ransom and we've got till noon tomorrow to pay up?
So that's it. Well, I'm sure you won't be alone.
An international auction, with nuclear supremacy goin' to the highest bidder.
Tell me, what does he need to control that satellite?
A simple set of tapes fed into a computer bank.
All he really needs is a building.
And these tapes? Large or small?
Conceivably any size.
From six inches to a cassette.
Assuming he's still using your empire as a cover,
Blofeld could be anywhere on this map.
From Alaska to Florida.
From Maine to Oregon.
From Texas to... Baja California.
Baja?!
I haven't got anything in Baja!
There is still no official explanation of the apparent nuclear accidents in North Dakota and Russia.
Presidential news secretary John Fenner refused comment on a report that an emergency meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is in session.
It is believed the United States and the Soviet Union have assured each other that no offensive action has been taken by either nation.
Reports of another nuclear accident in Red China are as yet unconfirmed.
Two more submarines have taken up position not ten miles away.
Are those military aircraft going to stand off forever?
What if they won't accept our ultimatum?
What if they attack?
Calm yourself, Metz. This farcical show of force was only to be expected.
The Great Powers flexing their military muscles like so many impotent beach boys.
I deeply regret my threat to destroy a major city unless they give in, but the nuclear powers, like all bullies, can only be intimidated by force.
- But how can you...
- They still have an hour left to reply.
One hour for both of us to achieve our common dream: Total disarmament and peace for the world.
- Sir, there's a single plane approaching.
- Range?
Two miles, and closing.
Stage One alert, please.
Command Center.
All crew to Stage One.
Up the top! Second platform!
There he is!
- Aim!
- Hold your fire!
All recovery crew personnel, proceed to docking level and stand by.
Good morning, gentlemen!
The Acme Pollution Inspection.
We're cleaning up the world. We thought this was a suitable starting point.
How disappointing! I expected one head of state, at the very least.
Surely you haven't come to negotiate, Mr. Bond?
Your pitiful little island hasn't even been threatened.
Search him from his toenails to the last follicle on his head. Then bring him to me.
I do so hate martial music.
As usual, Mr. Bond, you were absolutely right.
You guessed correctly that that box contained the satellite control tape and you came aboard presumably hoping to substitute this for the real thing.
So sorry to have ruined the line of your suit for nothing.
Talking about lines, which one did you use on Miss Case?
She has taken a reasonable attitude.
Like any sensible animal, she's only threatening when threatened.
Well, it appears that you're holding all the aces.
- Right down to the dragon lady here.
- Jealousy? From you, Mr. Bond?
I'm flattered.
As La Rochefoucauld observed:
"Humility is the worst form of conceit."
I do hold the winning hand.
Why don't you let me take you on a little tour of our facilities?
Your chance to see the real tape once again.
Can I tag along, Ernst?
I'd put something on over that bikini first, my dear.
I've come too far to have the aim of my crew affected by the sight of a pretty body.
No word yet from anyone!
Only 12 minutes left.
I suppose a little gentle prodding is called for.
As you see, Mr. Bond, the satellite is at present over
Kansas.
If we destroy Kansas, the world may not hear about it for years.
Perhaps New York.
All that smut and traffic.
It would give them a chance for a fresh start.
Washington, DC. Perfect.
Since we have not heard from them, they will hear from us.
- See to it, Metz.
- Washington. Right.
And this, presumably, is the control bank with the coded tape.
Right again, Mr. Bond.
All satellites are controlled by a coded tape.
The trick is, of course, to have the code.
Obviously.
It all seems so perfectly simple. I suppose one just presses that and out it pops.
Put it back, Mr. Bond.
Immediately.
Hi, Ernst.
Is Superman giving you any trouble?
Put it back... very carefully.
You've suddenly become tiresome, Mr. Bond.
Target fixed! Commence countdown!
Ten minutes and counting!
Take him away and throw him in the brig.
And search him again, just to make sure.
Bitch!
Come on!
Your problems are all behind you now.
Stop him!
Nine minutes and counting.
I did it. I switched the tape in the machine.
You stupid twit. You put the real one back in.
Come on, let's go!
A weather balloon!
- What do you think, Mr. Leiter?
- That must be the signal.
There isn't a low-pressure area within 200 miles of here. Let's go!
This is Charlie One to Squadron.
Charlie One to Squadron.
Ready all guns and proceed to target.
I repeat: Proceed to target.
Roger, Charlie One. Out.
Come on, Bond. Get the hell off that rig.
Eight minutes and counting.
Unidentified aircraft approaching rapidly.
Range... five miles.
But I... I don't understand!
- You said they wouldn't attack!
- The balloon was a signal.
The stupid fools must think
Mr. Bond has accomplished his mission.
- Activate defenses!
- Activate defenses.
Seven minutes and counting.
This is Charlie One.
Commence attack!
Commence attack!
Six minutes and counting.
Get them on the radio, Blofeld!
- Tell them we give up!
- Give up?
I've waited too long for this moment.
They'll pay dearly for making a fool out of me.
I see it all now.
You don't give a damn about peace!
- All you care about...
- Shut up, Metz.
Tiffany, my dear.
We're showing a bit more cheek than usual, aren't we?
Take her below and lock her up with Mr. Bond.
What a pity. Such nice cheeks, too.
If only they were brains.
Destroy this, Metz.
Five minutes and counting.
Four minutes and counting.
Tell them we surrender!
This is utter madness!
One more word, Metz, and I'll have you shot! Get back to your post!
Prepare my bathosub immediately.
Three minutes and counting.
All systems interlock.
Bathosub to crane. Commence lift.
Two minutes and counting.
Power and breathing systems on.
Release catch is open.
Lower away.
Bathosub to crane! Lower away!
Wake up, man! Lower away!
You stupid idiot! You could've killed me!
Disengage!
Disengage!
Disengage!
Lower! Not up!
One minute and counting.
Blofeld to Command Center!
Come in!
Blofeld to Command Center!
Come in!
Damn you!
Command Center, come in!
40 seconds and counting.
Get the gun.
- Here!
- Shoot 'em!
Jump!
Ten... nine...
So long, James! I'll wire M you're on your way home!
Don't tell him which direction we've taken!
If you're havin' a good time, let the captain know and
I'll have him steam around in circles!
James, there's something very important
I've been meaning to ask you about us.
I know in a relationship like ours, the girl's not supposed to be the one to ask.
But I can't help it.
And please think before answering.
That I promise.
James...
There must be some mistake.
I didn't order anything.
No mistake, sir.
On the specific instructions and with the compliments of Mr. Willard Whyte.
Oysters Andaluz.
Shashlik.
Tidbits.
Prime rib en jus.
Salade Utopia.
And for dessert, the pièce de résistance... la bombe surprise.
That looks fantastic! What's in it?
But then there would be no surprise, would there, madame?
- If madam would care to be seated.
- Thank you.
This will just take a moment, and then we will leave you in peace.
Wine, sir?
Mouton Rothschild '55.
- May we begin?
- Please do.
A happy selection, if I may say.
I'll be the judge of that.
That's rather potent.
Not the cork - your aftershave.
Strong enough to bury anything.
But the wine is quite excellent.
Although, for such a grand meal,
I had rather expected a claret.
Of course.
Unfortunately, our cellar is rather poorly stocked with clarets.
Mouton Rothschild is a claret.
And I've smelt that aftershave before.
And both times I've smelt a rat.
He certainly left with his tails between his legs.
Oh, James!
Oh, yes. What were you about to ask me?
James...
How the hell do we get those diamonds down again?
Captain wants you to keep 500 feet.
Maneuvering, Control.
Come in shallow to 500 feet.
- Keep 500 feet.
- Keep 500 feet, sir.
What the hell's going on, Eddie?
Emergency stations.
Captain to the control room.
- What's going on?
- Number five bulkhead shut down.
- Control, Maneuvering.
- Control, Captain.
I'm losing electrical frequency.
I'll have to break down the system.
Control, Sound Room.
Total loss of power on all sonar sets.
Surface.
Blow forward, blow aft, full ahead.
Full rise on both planes.
Raise the search periscope.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, put him through.
Good morning, sir.
No, First Sea Lord.
There's been no contact with Ranger yet, sir.
No sightings, no distress signals, sir.
It looks very much like it.
Yes, of course I will, sir.
We've lost one of our nuclear submarines.
What?
The submarine Potempkin disappeared without trace?
What a catastrophe, Comrade Chairman.
Yes, of course.
I'll assign our best agent immediately.
- Rubelvitch, where is Agent XXX?
- On leave, General.
At a people's rest and recuperation center.
It's been a wonderful weekend.
- I shall never forget it.
- Nor will I.
When can we meet again?
As soon as my mission is accomplished.
I must go.
I have to be in Austria tonight.
Five more minutes.
Agent XXX.
Calling Agent XXX.
You will report to headquarters immediately.
Agent XXX, acknowledge and verify.
This is XXX.
Message received and understood.
Yes, Mr. Prime Minister. I understand the gravity of the situation.
Yes, I'll put our best man on it at once.
Good-bye.
Moneypenny, where is 007?
He's on a mission, sir, in Austria.
Tell him to pull out, immediately.
Oh, James,
I cannot find the words.
Let me try and enlarge your vocabulary.
What's happened?
- Where are you going?
- Sorry, darling. Something came up.
But, James, I need you.
So does England.
He has just left.
Over and out.
Message received. We are waiting.
Over and out.
Now.
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it
Half as good as you
Baby, you're the best
I wasn't looking
But somehow you found me
I tried to hide from
Your love light
But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight
And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish
Someone could
Nobody does it
Quite the way you do
Why do you have to be so good
The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic
Inside you
That keeps me from running
But just keep it coming
How'd you learn to do the things you do
Baby, baby
Baby, you're the best
Send in Agent XXX.
You sent for me, Comrade General.
Good morning. Major Amasova, we are facing a most delicate situation.
Our nuclear submarine Potempkin has disappeared.
Sabotage?
That is for you to find out.
We have one lead:
A connection in Cairo.
You leave tonight.
Will that be all?
There is one more thing.
I regret to inform you, Major, that
Agent Sergei Borzov has been killed.
On a mission at Berngarten in the Austrian Alps.
A tragic occurrence,
Comrade General.
It had not escaped our notice that you and Agent Borzov... had been more than friends for some time.
I'm very sorry.
How did he die?
We haven't all the details yet.
It appears he'd become involved in a British Secret Service operation.
Please keep me informed,
Comrade General.
I should very much like to meet... whoever was responsible for his death.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, 007.
- Hello, Q.
- Mission successful?
- On and off.
- Good morning, Commander.
- Good morning, sir.
- Captain Forsyth.
- Sir.
Commander Bond, sir.
- Mr. Fredrick Gray, Minister of Defense.
- Good morning, Commander.
Admiral Hargreaves,
Flag Officer, Submarines.
- Ark Royal, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.
- I believe M told you about this.
- Yes, Minister.
Over here, please, gentlemen.
This, I take it, is Ranger's prearranged coastal patrol area.
- That's right.
- How many people knew this course?
Admiral Hargreaves, myself... and Talbot, the submarine captain.
Good God.
Where did this come from?
I'm sorry, Benson.
For the moment, that's top secret.
I see, sir.
Commander, this tracing means... that the Russians can track our nuclear submarines underwater and sink them.
- I believe it does.
- How could they? It's impossible.
It's quite simple.
Heat signature recognition, most likely.
- With your permission, Minister?
- Yes, of course.
Thank you.
We already know that satellites with infrared heat sensors... can detect a nuclear missile in flight by its tail fire.
Well?
Someone can now locate a submerged nuclear submarine... in exactly the same way, by its wake.
That means they can totally undermine our Western defense strategy.
Yes, it looks like it.
Where did we get that tracing, Freddie?
Cairo, diplomatic bag.
Somebody got the plans of that tracking system and is trying to sell them.
They sent us that tracing as proof that it's genuine.
Then, if there is a deal to be made, the price will be high.
"High"? Astronomical.
That missing submarine had 16 Polaris missiles aboard.
We have a contact in Egypt?
M will give you the details.
You leave tonight.
Dr. Bechmann and Professor Markovitz.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, now that the moment has come to bid you farewell...
I congratulate both you, Doctor, and you, Professor... on your brilliant work in the development... of the submarine tracking system.
Thanks primarily to you,
I'm happy to say... that the first phase of our operation... has met with considerable success.
I have instructed my assistant... to have paid into your...
Swiss bank account... the sum of $10 million each.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, indeed.
And that, I think, concludes our business.
Before you go, however...
I very much regret to inform you... that a dangerous development... has recently been brought to my notice.
Someone has been attempting to sell the plans... of our tracking project... to competing world powers.
Someone intimately associated with the project.
My dear, it would be more seemly if you left us.
Thank you.
It was you who betrayed me.
You had access to all the information.
Now you will pay the penalty.
Once again, gentlemen, my most profound thanks.
- Sandor.
- Yes, sir.
Jaws.
I'm assigning you the task... of recovering the microfilm copy... of the tracking system.
Sandor, you will go with him.
Obey him.
Every person who even comes into contact with that microfilm... is to be eliminated.
Stand by for helicopter takeoff.
All personnel, clear the flight deck platform.
Cancel transfer of $20 million.
Inform next of kin that a tragic accident... has resulted in the death of Professor Markovitz... and Dr. Bechmann.
The funeral was at sea.
May the peace of Allah descend upon this magnificent abode... and allow a poor traveler to enter.
May the hospitality of these miserable quarters... be sufficient to your honored needs.
James Bond, what a delightful surprise after all these years.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
I always wondered what you were gonna do when you went down from Cambridge.
I never had any problems knowing what you were going to do, Hosein.
We don't only have oil, you know.
What can I offer you?
Sheep's eyes? Dates?
- Vodka martini?
- Information.
Who is putting the submarine tracking system on the market?
What a pity it is you insist on being so businesslike.
The gentleman you will eventually be dealing with... is a certain Max Kalba.
- "Eventually"?
- To reach Kalba... you must first make contact with a man called Fekkesh.
Aziz Fekkesh. I'll give you his apartment address in Cairo.
It's too late to meet him today.
Can I persuade you to accept a bed for the night?
That's kind of you, Hosein, but I really feel I...
Are you quite sure I can't persuade you to stay the night?
When one is in Egypt... one should delve deeply into its treasures.
Yes. Oh, I'm sorry.
The door was open.
Mr. Fekkesh is expecting me.
I phoned him.
He asked me to give you a message.
He will be late.
May I ask where he is?
Mr. Fekkesh asked me to entertain you while you are waiting.
Really?
Where is Fekkesh?
You are very suspicious.
I find I live much longer that way.
Now where is he?
If there's anything at all you would like...
I had lunch, but I seem to have missed dessert.
As urgent as my appointment is,
I'd hate him to walk in and surprise us.
There is no danger of that.
He'll be some time then?
Is he meeting someone?
I'm sorry,
I cannot answer that question.
Oh, I think you can.
Where's Fekkesh?
Pyramids.
What a helpful chap.
You have come tonight to the most fabulous... and celebrated place in the world.
Here on the Plateau of Giza stands forever... the mightiest of human achievements.
No traveler, emperor, merchant or poet... has trodden on these sands... and not gasped in awe.
The curtain of night is about to rise... and disclose the stage on which... the drama of a civilization took place.
Those involved have been present since the dawn of history... pitched stubbornly against sand and wind.
And the voice of the desert... has crossed the centuries.
Excuse me, Major.
I'll be back in a moment.
With each new dawn,
I see the sun god rise... on the far bank of the Nile.
I am the faithful warden at the foot of his lord.
So faithful, so vigilant... so near him... that he gave me his face for my own.
I am a pharaoh's companion... and I am he, the pharaoh.
This is the tomb of Cheops...
Pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty
4,500 years ago.
Here is the Great Pyramid which he built... to defend himself against death.
Here in the depths of his tomb... a servant of the king awaits the call... to set out upon his journey into eternity.
Death lies waiting.
Where is Fekkesh?
With the pharaohs.
- You killed him.
- No, he was dead when I found him.
Hope you enjoyed the show.
Good night.
What an unexpected pleasure.
Welcome to the Mujaba Club.
Buy you a drink,
Major Amasova?
Or may I call you XXX?
You know who I am.
You made quite an impression.
I'm sorry about Ivan and Boris.
They exceeded their orders.
Good staff is hard to find these days.
Yes, sir?
The lady will have a Bacardi on the rocks.
For the gentleman, vodka martini, shaken not stirred.
Touche.
Commander James Bond.
Recruited to the British Secret Service from the Royal Navy.
Licensed to kill, and has done so on numerous occasions.
Many lady friends, but married only once.
- Wife killed...
- All right, you've made your point.
You're sensitive.
About certain things, yes.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Tragically,
I have a previous engagement.
Happily enough, so do I.
- Good-bye, Mr. Bond.
- Let's say au revoir.
I have the oddest feeling we'll be meeting again sometime.
I'm looking for Mr. Kalba.
Mr. Max Kalba is the owner of the club, sir.
Over there.
Mr. Kalba, my name is James Bond.
What of it?
You had an appointment with Mr. Fekkesh.
- Well?
- He won't be joining you.
You have something
I'm interested in buying.
Just a moment.
I would like to bid for it too.
You forgot your drink.
Thank you.
It seems you have competition,
Mr. Bond.
From where I sit...
I fancy you will find the lady's figure hard to match.
Might the contestants be permitted to view the article for sale?
Well, now, who will start the bidding?
Mr. Kalba, sir, the telephone.
An urgent call.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
This is Kalba. Hello?
Another?
We've really got to stop meeting like this.
Kalba was called to the phone.
What happened?
He was cut off, permanently.
Where is the microfilm?
Search me.
He must have it, or you wouldn't be here.
You don't know who he is.
- He's a professional killer.
- Called Jaws?
Make no mistake, Mr. Bond...
I want that microfilm... and I'm going to get it.
Unless I get it first.
Watch out!
Don't move.
Give me the microfilm.
Egyptian builders.
Sorry.
You're just too late.
Give me the key!
The key!
Try the big one.
Can you play any other tune?
Let's try reverse.
That's backwards.
Would you like me to drive?
Women drivers.
Quiet. Watch this.
Shaken, but not stirred.
That gorilla must have his teeth fixed by a riveter.
By the way, thanks for deserting me back there.
Every woman for herself.
Remember?
Still, you did save my life.
We all make mistakes, Mr. Bond.
The cylinder head gasket.
What did he say?
He thinks we're overdressed, but he'll take us to Cairo.
Good.
It's getting cold.
Is there anything I can do to warm you up?
You don't have to worry about me.
I went on a survival course in Siberia.
Yes, I believe a great number of your countrymen do.
What did they teach you?
That it's very important to have a positive mental attitude.
Nothing more practical than that?
Food is also very important.
What else?
When necessary, shared bodily warmth.
That's the part I like.
Is this really what they do in Siberia?
Yes, but not how they do it.
You're not trying to take advantage of me, are you?
The thought never crossed my mind.
Just when it was getting interesting.
Where's the girl?
- Morning, Moneypenny.
- Good morning, James.
Is he in?
It must have been quite a party.
Boring.
I dropped off.
Hello, James.
We've been expecting you.
Good morning, sir.
There's been a change in plan.
You probably recognize my opposite number in the KGB, General Gogol.
I believe you're familiar with Major Amasova.
Enough to know which brand of cigarette she smokes.
Our respective governments... agreed to pool their resources to find out what happened to our submarines.
We have entered a new era... of Anglo-Soviet cooperation.
As a sign of Russian good faith...
I'm prepared to make available to you the microfilm... recovered by Agent XXX.
With considerable ease,
I might add.
Don't bother. It's useless.
I examined it on the boat.
I assure you it is quite genuine.
Except that the vital technical information has been taken out.
This was only intended to whet our appetites.
Maybe Q can make something out of it.
I want that ready for Akmid's tea party.
After you, Alexis.
- After you, Miles.
- Thank you.
That could bring tears to your eyes.
Everybody ready? Right.
We're pretty certain that this drawing was drafted in Italy.
The size corresponds with a Venetian octavo... and the typeface is an Italian one.
Now, note the slight upward stress on the transversals.
What's that mark there?
Probably a show-through of something... the drawing was resting on when it was photographed.
Must have been done in a hurry.
- Can you enlarge it?
- Wait a minute.
- "Oratory"? What is that?
- It's another word for chapel.
Looks a bit like a bishop's mitre.
It is a fish.
That is the symbol of the Stromberg Shipping Line.
Karl Stromberg? He's one of the richest men in the world.
One of the principle capitalist exploiters of the West, sir.
So it's not "oratory," it's laboratory.
Stromberg has a marine research laboratory.
On Corsica, I believe.
Well done.
Actually, it is in Sardinia.
That's brilliant.
I'm certain that two such perceptive talents... will enjoy working together in Sardinia... and that it will help to make
Anglo-Soviet cooperation a reality.
Here we are.
That was a delicious meal.
Thank you.
I didn't realize you had such a healthy appetite.
Neither did I.
It must be traveling by train.
I always enjoy it.
I remember when...
What do you remember?
I was going to talk about a mission.
Silly, isn't it?
We can't talk, and yet we're in the same business.
- But with rival companies.
- We're not rivals at the moment.
Then how about a nightcap, on the company?
My company.
I'm very sorry. I have an idea tomorrow is going to be a busy day.
- I must sleep.
- Yes.
- Well, then, sleep well.
- And you.
Good night.
What happened?
He just dropped in for a quick bite.
You're hurt.
Later.
Let's worry about you.
What was it they taught you on that survival course?
A positive mental attitude.
And shared bodily warmth.
Nothing about keeping out of drafts?
Still enjoy traveling by train?
You saved my life.
Thank you, James.
I'm sorry.
Why don't you lie down and let me look at it?
What can we use for a bandage?
How about this?
Wait a moment.
- Good morning, Major Boothroyd.
- Good morning, Major.
Look what Q has brought for us.
Isn't it nice?
Right.
Now pay attention, 007.
Take great care of this equipment.
There are some special accessories...
- Have I ever let you down?
- Frequently.
You have a reservation for me.
The name is Sterling.
Yes. Mr. And Mrs. Sterling.
Booked from Cairo.
That's right.
We have Suite A-5 for you; a sitting room and two bedrooms.
Moneypenny being over-efficient.
Do you have any messages for me?
Thank you.
Excellent.
We have been granted an audience.
- Mr. Sterling?
- Yes.
I'm Naomi.
Mr. Stromberg sent me to collect you.
How do you do?
This is my wife... who also happens to be my assistant.
- You are on holiday here?
- Where there's an ocean... a marine biologist is never on holiday.
Can we offer you a drink before we go?
No, thank you.
Mr. Stromberg's a very busy man.
His time is precious.
What a handsome craft.
Such lovely lines.
Thank you.
Very impressive.
I wonder if you'd mind showing my wife around...
- while I'm with Mr. Stromberg.
- Of course.
- This way.
- Thank you.
Don't be a bother to Naomi, darling.
- I'll be back soon.
- By the way...
Mr. Stromberg prefers not to shake hands.
- It's the third button.
- Thank you.
Why do we seek to conquer space... when seven-tenths of our universe remains to be explored?
The world beneath the sea.
You seem to be well-equipped to repair that oversight.
My name is Robert Sterling.
It's very kind of you to receive me.
It's always a pleasure to welcome someone with a mutual interest.
An extraordinary number of rare species.
You recognize that variety, of course.
Of course.
Other fish avoid it.
Those dorsal spines are laden with venom.
Handsome, but deadly.
I see you know your subject.
One tries.
You have a remarkable establishment here.
I'm somewhat of a recluse.
I wish to conduct my life on my own terms... and in surroundings with which I can identify.
That is a privilege of wealth.
Don't you miss the outside world?
For me, this is all the world.
There's beauty... there's ugliness... and there is death.
I think you will find this interesting.
An underwater city.
Fascinating, isn't it?
The only hope for the future of mankind.
We all have our dreams.
No dream, Mr. Sterling.
Soon a reality.
I'm afraid you must excuse me.
I have business to attend to.
Good-bye.
If we don't meet again,
I wish you luck with your research.
Thank you. The brief glimpse you've afforded me today... will only encourage me to redouble my efforts.
Good-bye.
- How interesting.
- There you are.
Darling, you should look at this model.
It's beautiful.
This is the Liparus... the latest addition to the Stromberg fleet.
Launched nine months ago.
At over a million tons, it's the largest tanker in the world.
- After the Karl Marx, of course.
- Really, darling?
It's amazing the items of information you store away.
Were they the two on the train?
James Bond... and the woman is Major Amasova, a Russian agent.
Let them get ashore... and then kill them.
You're being very secretive.
Where are we going?
I want another look at that Stromberg laboratory.
Do you think you could operate the tracking system from there?
It's possible.
All we know for sure is that two nuclear submarines are missing.
What did you think of that tanker model?
There was something strange about the design of her bows.
I've asked M to check her out.
- James, that motorcycle...
- Has been following us for a mile.
All those feathers and he still can't fly.
Yes, I know. Don't tell me.
You ever get the feeling somebody doesn't like you?
Can you swim?
It's time we said good-bye to an uninvited guest.
Alone at last.
That's what we've come to see.
Brace yourself.
Look!
How did you know about that?
I stole the blueprints of this car two years ago.
Do you think we can make it?
Hello.
- I have a message for you.
- I think you just delivered it.
Thank you.
Sorry to interrupt you... but I asked M for a list of all the ports... the Stromberg tanker had called at.
What is the answer?
In the nine months since she was fitted out... there is no record of her having put into port anywhere.
That's very odd, if it's true.
We don't make mistakes of that sort.
You sound just like a Russian.
I think we should take a closer look at that tanker, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Shall I contact Gogol?
There's no need.
- M has already offered to fix it.
- Very nice.
It's Austrian.
I bought it in Berngarten.
- I was doing some skiing.
- When was this?
About three weeks ago. Why?
Do you recognize him?
Who is he?
The man I loved.
He was in Berngarten three weeks ago.
Did you kill him?
When someone's behind you on skis at 40 miles an hour... trying to put a bullet in your back... you don't always have time to remember a face.
In our business, people get killed.
We both know that.
So did he.
It was either him or me.
The answer to the question is yes.
I did kill him.
Then, when this mission is over...
I will kill you.
Come in.
- Commander Carter?
- That's right. Welcome aboard.
Major. Have a seat.
Can I get you something?
Not for me, thank you.
I don't know about the major.
I'm sorry.
I hadn't expected you to be a woman.
Aboard this vessel, Commander,
I am Major Amasova of the Russian Army.
- Yeah, sure.
- It's good of you to help us out.
Got a couple cabins at your disposal.
Thank you.
Major, you're most welcome to use the shower in my quarters.
You do not have to show me any special favors, Commander.
All the same,
I think it might be better if I did.
From Com Sub Atlantic, sir.
Right.
What's the matter, sailor?
You never see a major taking a shower before?
Stand by for second observation on target.
Up scope.
Check.
Target bearing. Mark.
Range. Mark.
Down scope.
- One division in high power.
- Range 6,200 yards, sir.
Angle on the bow, port 50.
Control, Torpedo Room.
Boarding party ready, sir.
Captain, sir, our best solution for the target is 120. Speed three knots.
Officer of the deck, come right north.
Maneuvering, make turns for 11 knots.
Officer of the deck, aye, sir.
Which bullet has my name on it?
The first or the last?
I have never failed on a mission,
Commander. Any mission.
In that case, Major... one of us is bound to end up gravely disappointed... because neither of the...
Control, Maneuvering.
We're losing electrical frequency.
Control, Sonar. Total power supplies failure on all sets.
- Surface!
- Blow forward! Blow aft!
Up scope. Stand by.
Where the hell is she?
She's right behind us.
Impossible.
Stand by on number two dock.
Liparus crew, take up positions.
Dock Officer to Operations.
Mobilization crew entering dock area.
Number two dock to Operations.
Twenty-five meters to run.
I say again.
Operation Room to number two dock.
Docking now complete.
Disembarkation crew moving into position.
S Ray program completed.
Magnetic field shut down.
All systems normal.
Limpet speaker in position, sir.
Commander, you have precisely two minutes... to open your hatches and surrender your ship.
The alternative is extermination by cyanide gas.
Well?
There's no alternative.
Now hear this.
Your Captain speaking.
Open all hatches and proceed quietly onto the casing.
Hurry, Commander.
I'm not renown for my patience.
Okay, two ranks.
Move it out.
Stay close to me.
We'll try and hide you.
Our time is limited, Captain.
- Commence operations forthwith.
- Yes, sir.
Attention all personnel.
Stromberg crews One and Two... embark your submarines.
Put the Americans in with the others, Captain.
Remove the prisoners.
Don't look up.
You're on Candid Camera.
Complete nuclear missile loading.
Operations, Radar.
No contacts within 25,000 meters.
Bring those two prisoners here.
Let's go. Come on now.
Operations Room, Sonar.
No contacts, no transmissions.
Cease stable hold.
You have certainly been persistent.
Very well.
Now your curiosity can be satisfied.
Both crews aboard, sir.
Missile onload completed.
They have already been given their targets.
At 12:00 noon, they will have reached firing positions.
Within minutes,
New York and Moscow... will cease to exist.
Global destruction will follow.
The new era will begin.
Submarines One and Two... commence departure drill.
All right, you've made your point.
How much do you want?
"How much?"
Whatever do you mean, Mr. Bond?
The price for not firing those nuclear missiles.
You're deluded, Mr. Bond.
I'm not interested in extortion.
I intend to change the face of history.
By destroying the world?
By creating a world.
A new and beautiful world beneath the sea.
Today, civilization as we know it is corrupt and decadent.
Inevitably, it will destroy itself.
I'm merely accelerating the process.
That does not justify mass murder.
For that, Major...
I will accept the judgment of posterity.
Submarines ready for departure, sir.
Open bow doors, Captain.
Stromberg One... you are clear to proceed to sea.
Stromberg Two, you are also clear to proceed to sea. Forward stern.
Observe, Mr. Bond, the instruments of Armageddon.
Put this man with the rest of the prisoners.
The lady will be traveling to Atlantis with me.
Farewell, Mr. Bond.
That word has, I must admit... a welcome ring of permanency about it.
Au revoir, Anya.
Bring her.
Get that man!
Keep going.
Call him over.
- Where's your captain?
- Here.
Release the other crews, then make for the armory.
Follow me, men.
At the double.
Come on. Let's go.
Seal the operations room!
You! Stand by over there!
Help yourself to firearms!
Grab a weapon.
Come on, let's go.
We've taken both sides of the lower dock area, but your captain's dead.
We're still no closer to that control room.
Leave it to me, sir.
Andrews, James, Marchal, Purvis.
Follow me.
That armored plating must be inches thick.
- We'll never get through it.
- Let's get to the armory.
- What do you reckon to find there?
- A nuclear missile.
A nuc... Hey, wait!
This could take hours, sir.
You got a date?
No, sir.
Now you are beautiful.
I'm sorry if you feel less than comfortable... but you have a tendency to violence that must be controlled.
- What is it?
- I have to report, sir... a breakout by some of the prisoners.
That is unfortunate, Captain.
However, sir, we now have the situation under control.
The operations room is quite impregnable.
Then we must hope, Captain, that you will suffer no further mishap.
All I need out of here is the detonator.
James, are you sure you know what you're doing?
There has to be a first time for everything.
Blast.
What's the problem?
I mustn't touch any part of the impulse conductor circuit.
This ring houses the impulse conductor circuit, sir.
It's magnetic. I mustn't touch it with any part of the detonator.
- What happens if you do?
- It'll go off.
- Get me a number six detonator.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Number six, sir.
- Thank you.
Did you fix that 20-second fuse?
Yes, sir. Here it is.
Plastic explosive.
Is everything proceeding according to plan?
- Yes, sir.
- Excellent.
- Sir?
- What is it?
The monitors faded.
Change the circuit.
Cease fire!
You're too late, Bond.
Our submarines are already on station.
In four minutes, the missiles will be launched.
Can you work the printout transmission unit?
Sure, but we've only got three minutes.
If we can work out the position of those submarines, maybe we can reprogram them.
- To do what?
- To destroy each other.
James! The globe!
Pass the position of the first submarine to the second as their target.
- And vice versa?
- Exactly.
Missile Control, this is the Captain.
We have a change of target.
New coordinates are 034285219.
Missile Control, Captain.
We have a new target.
Everybody back on board the submarine!
Pass it on!
Come on! Let's go!
Foster, get those lines cleared!
Come on!
Leaver, throw those guys a line!
Get those block fenders cleared!
Fore and aft!
Get the submarine at diving stations!
Control, Maneuvering.
Reactor at half-power state.
Ready to check telegraphs.
All personnel, take up positions fast!
- Get Roberts in the gyro unit.
- Right.
Come on! Move it!
Stand by to revert to normal lighting.
Come on, sailor.
Get that hatch shut quick.
- Torpedo Room, Control.
- Torpedo Room.
Load tube one with mark 46 torpedo.
Open outer door on tube one.
Select zero gyro angle.
Outer door on tube one open.
Match bearings and shoot.
- Set.
- Shoot.
Torpedo running.
Rudder amidships.
Ahead two-thirds.
Left seven degrees rudder.
How far would you say?
- About 10,000 yards, sir.
- Commander.
Close it.
I just got this signal from the Pentagon.
On instructions from the Security Council:
"Destroy Atlantis fast. "
What does "fast" mean?
Battle stations five minutes.
With torpedoes?
Yes.
He has Anya on there.
- I know. I'm sorry.
- I have to get her off.
- How?
- Can I have the equipment Q sent?
Sure.
Barton. That package for Commander Bond, bring it in quick.
- I need an hour.
- That comes from the top!
Forty minutes!
You're gonna get me court-martialed.
One hour.
Come in.
I'll give you a hand.
Good evening, Mr. Bond.
I've been expecting you.
Stay where you are.
I'll send the elevator down for you.
Good-bye, Mr. Bond.
You did want me to drop in.
- Where's Anya?
- Well, well, well.
A British agent in love with a Russian agent.
Detente, indeed.
Sit down, Mr. Bond.
- Your time is running out.
- Yours too, Mr. Bond.
And faster than you think.
You shot your bolt.
Now it's my turn.
How does that grab you?
We're five minutes overdue, Captain.
- Stromberg?
- Dead.
So are we unless we get out of here fast.
Match bearings and shoot.
Maybe I misjudged Stromberg.
Any man who drinks Dom Perignon '52 can't be all bad.
The mission is over, Commander.
In my country, the condemned man is usually allowed a final request.
Granted.
Let's get out of these wet things.
But, James, what would our superiors say?
They'll never know.
Lower the stern gate.
- Is there danger of the bends?
- We'll soon find out.
- XXX.
What are you doing?
Keeping the British end up, sir.
? Have you ever dreamed of a place ?
? far away from it all? ?
? Where the air you breathe is soft and clean ?
? and children play in fields of green ?
? and the sound of guns ?
? doesnÆt pound in your ears. ?

Wise, gimme that.
George, lets get out as many as we can.
Bring them out now.
Don't overload me Conway!
Mr. Lovett?
Calme vu.
It's all right.
Plenty of planes are coming.
Patients, patients.
Please be patient.
Plenty of planes are coming.
Please.
Don't worry. Everyone will get away.
Please don't worry the planes are coming.
Get me Hong Kong will you.
Talking to them sir.
Hello it's Conway here. Where are those planes you promised me?
I still got a whole lot of people to get out.
The whole towns on fire and the guerrillas are nearly here.
That runway won't take heavy jets.
We've sent you every other plain we could commandeer, even freighters.
Now, Fenner's in charge.
They should be there any time. Now, take your people and clear out.
My people! What about the rest of them here?
Richard, Bill Ferguson here.
Yes Bill?
We've had a lot of flak from your local military authority.
They have forbidden us to let you evacuate any of their nationals.
The ST says you are to take only your own group, only those you have listed.
Do you hear me?
- Yes, I hear you Bill, but it's not...
- Hey, it's the planes.
They're here.
Just a minute, we think the planes are here.
Thank you.
Oh my god, whats happen.
They must have blown up the generator.
Come on.
Those planes can't land without light.
Hello, Hong Kong.
Come in Hong Kong.
Let's go.
[Chele', Chele'!]
[Chele'!]
[Ah' roo cha']
[Chele' Chele' Chele'
Chele' Chele']
Let's get back to the main building.
Here they are, now let have the next group.
Only the women.
All right quiet please, just calm down.
Hay Miss. Come on, you get left behind.
Let the heroes go first.
You an American?
No, Mongolian.
You have to teach me the language sometime.
He's away.
We go on the next plane. Bring out everybody that's left.
Right.
Hello Fenner.
Hello Conway.
Having a little trouble?
Enough.
Does this thing really fly?
From time to time she does.
Over there. Keep them back.
Tell Fenner to take off.
Fenner, let's go!
Fenner!
Get down! Get down on the floor!
Get down!
Fenner, come on!
Fenner, takeoff!
Come on Fenner!
Fenner!
Everybody all right?
Yeah, sure.
Now we all have a long journey ahead of us.
Now I suggest you make yourselves as comfortable as possible.
Right?
- Fine.
- OK.
G-George, see if you can find some food.
Uh, where we heading?
Hong Kong.
Who are you? I don't remember listing you.
Yeah, well I sort of arrived the last minute.
Names Harry Lovett the comedian.
Just finished three solid weeks, top of the bill, Saigon USO.
Terrific audience those guys.
I love um'.
Saigon?
What were you doing in Baskul.
Yeah, well, we had a few drinks and someone said "Let's go see the Temples."
And there was this plane and we had a few more drinks and uh, all of a sudden we were in the middle of the jungle.
Temple of Baskulla was pretty funny.
Then the shells start falling and nobody's laughing.
All right, I'll get some particulars from you later.
Hi, name's Harry Lovett.
The Comedian.
Sam Cornelius. The Engineer.
Milk and sandwiches.
Milk? Somebody at headquarters has a sense of humor.
Dish it out.
I'm going to make out my report, while I can still remember the details.
No thank you.
Of course...
You're Sally Hughes, of Newsweek.
Yes.
IÆm George Conway,
London Express.
Hello.
Richards my brother.
I was covering him on the peace talks when the whole thing blew up.
Well did you get some good stuff on the airfield just now?
Look, I'm through with all this!
And I'm tired.
I'm sorry.
The way Fenner is flying this thing we're in for a rough night.
I uh, just found some jungle juice.
Can I freshen your milk?
Sure.
It's pretty rough eh?
Yeah.
Were you on a project back there?
Yeah.
Really?
Really.
Well, take it easy.
Ah, well gentlemen, I ah,... not been too successful up front.
Could I interest you in a little bourbon?
Oh, you're our man.
Yes.
Great.
Great?
Well, God Save the Queen.
Cheers.
Mr. Conway? Mr. Conway, wake up.
Look outside.
We're traveling in the wrong direction.
Look, I know I flunked boy scout, but from what I remember the sun rises in the east.
Hong Kong is east, we're going west.
He's right. The suns behind us.
It's desert down there.
Must be a reason.
Fenner too good a pilot to get lost.
What goes on?
Fenner?
Fenner?
What's happening?
Fenner?
[Meet say nay grean?]
- Whats happening?
- It's a hijack!
Hijacking DC-3. Come on.
That's what it looks like.
Well, what are we going to do?
What do you suggest?
He could be a maniac, we gotta do something.
Such as?
Be quite!
Now listen everybody, there's nothing we can do about this for the moment.
So I suggest you all sit down and as far as possible, relax.
That guy has a gun!
There's nothing we can do about it until he lands, now please, sit down.
George.
We're heading down!
We're going to land.
I don't see a landing strip, do you?
[Ming mashe ta lue]
[Ming mashe ta lue]
[Ah sha tee]
[Ah sha tee]
[Ming mashe ta lue]
[Ling pi oh]
[Ay Sing ling bi oh]
[Sing ling bi oh]
Let's find out what's going on.
I think their refueling.
[Say poo da la ca poo]
The other facts to consider are these.
That the fuel was waiting, the armed men were waiting,
And they wouldn't let us off.
If this was an ordinary hijacking they would have kept us back there in the desert.
- Exactly.
- It could be political.
That means you Richard.
I doubt it. The whole point is on ***
Oh c'mon Conway, you'd be a price in anybody's book.
And for good measure they got two journalist.
And by his own account, a famous comedian.
Very funny but, what about you Cornelius.
Maybe they want you.
Who are you!
I'm somebody flying a strange plane, to a strange place, with a lunatic pilot and I'm trying to find out why, that's who I am.
All right all right all right.
God he's really going high.
What's the ceiling on these planes?
I don't know.
Let's see if that oxygen equipment works.
Thank you.
If the altitude gets you, swallow hard.
Or hold your noseà And blow.
That's it.
Here.
Hold it.
Breathe deeply.
- OK?
- OK.
This one's empty.
Now take deep breaths.
Slowly, slowly.
Is that any better?
I feel like were heading for outer space.
Easy now.
Mmm.... You know a guy to get to like this.
What's happening?!
He's losing his left engine.
Seat belts, strap in!
Brace yourselves! Lean forward.
Right, forward.
Lock your hands behind your head!
Don't let them snap back!
Ahhh!
Get down!
Oh!
Are you all right?
Look after the others.
How are the others?
Shaken, but OK.
He's had it.
Here's a map.
You see that spot where he's marked
I'll bet that's where we refueled.
There's the end of civilization.
We must be 1000 miles beyond that.
Just a blank here on the map.
Hay, whats happening Conway?
Conway?
Don't tell them about this George.
- Conway.
- Just a minute.
- How are you?
- I'm all right.
Where the hell are we?
Down on solid ground and it feels great.
What are you doing?
Listen buddy, I don't know about you, but I'm scared and this helps.
What's the situation?
- The pilots dead.
- Well where are we?
As far as I can make out, in an unexplored part of the world.
How do we get out?
At the moment we don't.
We stay here.
Only a fully equipped expedition could last outside.
So here we stay, all calm and cool.
We're sure gonna' be cool.
It's not so bad we've got ahà blankets, a stove, emergency rations.
We can get through the days. The nights maybe a little bit more difficult.
But will manage, until somebody finds us.
Till somebody finds us.
They will.
- I've got another one to work.
- Good.
Hear, hear.
Drink this. It hasn't got much taste, but it's hot.
As a matter of fact it hasn't got any taste at all.
I'll try one then.
All right, à there.
Mr. Conway.
There lights out there.
Mr. Conway there are lights out there!
Hey, there are people out there, moving in the snow.
Coming towards us, down that mountain!
There is something, they found us!
I knew they would, I knew it!
Come on.
Conway, what is this?
[I non cee, holla?]
I am from a nearby Lamasery.
My name is Chang.
Mine is Richard Conway.
How do you do?
How you do.
Forgive me, I hadn't expected anybody in this part of the world to talk English.
I was an undergraduate at
Oxford in my young days.
It was there that I had the opportunity of improving my knowledge of your language.
You speak it very well.
You have no idea how welcome you are.
Yesterday our plane left
Baskulla for Hong Kong but we suddenly found ourselves hijacked and traveling in the opposite direction.
- The pilotà
- Where is your pilot?
He was killed in the crash.
May I see him?
Please.
[Marie ta' ma green ta luu']
Mr. Chang, you're obviously on a journey of your own, but could you possibly take us to your Lamasery?
I would consider it an honor.
You will need suitable clothes for the journey.
It is not particularly far but it is quite difficult.
I suggest we start at daybreak.
Aah!
Welcome to Shangri
La, Mr. Conway.
You see we are sheltered by mountains on every side.
A strange phenomenon for which we are very grateful.
Come, let me show you.
This is Brother To Len.
He will show you to your rooms.
Shangri-La welcomes you.
If you should wish to assume our habits of dress you will find suitable garments.
You would need to rest now.
And later I shall be most pleased to see you all at dinner.
Mr. Chang.
Please.
I am happy to report that the plane has arrived.
With Richard Conway?
With Conway and four others.
Excellent.
What are we going to do now?
What we always do?
- Miss. Hughes!
- Gasp!
That is the coward's way out.
You are in the midst of life.
Do not seek death, it will find you.
But choose the road that makes death a fulfillment.
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, a funny thing happened to me on the way to the Airport.
Get a load of the outfit have Kimona will travel.
Both look pretty silly.
When in Rome, do as the romans do.
C'mon, let's get something to eat, take a quick look around the place, and catch the first train out here.
We've just crash a plane in the middle of nowhere, spent all day dragging ourselves up a mountain and you're looking for the nearest ticket office?
Man, where do you think we're gonna go?
Um, suits you.
I thought I might find Chang here.
No, sorry.
I'm not doing very well so far I failed to find him orà
- Telephone or telex.
- Telex?
Even a socket for my razor.
Hard luck.
- You better use mine.
- Thanks.
Seriously, I must get in touch with my paper.
Well an hour or two won't make any difference will it?
It does to me. I want to get this story off before we eat.
And I want a few more peaceful moments before the world gets its claws into me again.
Oh well, in that case,
I'll make a big sacrifice.
I'll shave and shut up.
Thank you George,
I'm very grateful.
Until dinner.
? Friendly doors open wide ?
? Come and share the peace and life you will find inside ?
? Share the joy ?
? Let the sun comfort you ?
? It will keep you safe and warm, always shining through ?
? Share the joy ?
? All the lovely songs you will hear, ?
? means we all hold dear ?
? At the same time ?
? All the grandest things we possess, ?
? means we value less ?
? So many small things can bring happiness ?
? Love is in all things ?
? Flowers bloom, people grow ?
? You may never want to leave when it's time to go ?
? Share the joy ?
? Mountains rise, mountains fall ?
? You have nothing more to prove, you have climbed them all ?
? Now you're here ?
? May you ?
? stay and share the joy ?
Now that's the best thing to cheer me up since we got here.
? Now you're here ?
? May you ?
? stay and share the joy ?
Bravo.
Good evening my friends.
Did you think I had forgotten you?
- Have you everything you need?
- Everything thank you.
We're sorry, Miss Hughes?
She asked me to say she's not feeling well, it is nothing serious.
I hope she's well enough to travel when we leave.
Mr. Chang, I have some questions?
Please, ask them.
We all wish to return to civilization as soon as possible.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Mr. Chang, I think I speak for all of us, when I say your hospitality is quite remarkable and we're very grateful.
But were also anxious to go home as soon as we can.
That is always the case Mr. Conway.
And even more urgent, for some of us, is to send cables.
Unfortunately, we lack radio communication of any sort.
It has always been a source of deep regret, that the same mountains that allow us our splendid weather, also prevent adequate wireless reception.
Then perhaps you could send porter's or messengers or some sort.
But I'd really like to tell my agent I'm safe.
He's bound to have some bookings for me.
We have no porter's or messengers.
No porter's, butà
You were rescued by our own people.
Who have never gone beyond the point of which you were found.
Two venture further would be too hazardous.
How'd you get all this stuff brought here?
Ahh, yes.
Well, depending upon favorable weather of course.
There are porters,
500 miles away who sometimes make the journey.
They are our only contact with what you would call, the outside world.
How soon can we get in touch with them?
In that respect you are exceedingly fortunate.
We are expecting a shipment from them at almost any moment.
And when is "almost any moment" Mr. Chang.
Tomorrow, next week?
I cannot forecast the exact date, precisely.
Let me see, I believeà
Aww, yes we have been expecting this particular shipment, for about two years.
But I assure you gentlemen, I shall endeavor to make your stay here as pleasant as possible.
And now, if you'll excuse me, it is getting late.
I hope you will all sleep well.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Goodnight Mr. Conway.
Goodnight sir.
About two years.
Did you believe all that stuff about the porters?
I don't know.
- Don't you care?
- Not really.
It's nice to be in a place where time doesn't matter.
Yes, but you wanna get out of here, don't you?
I don't know what I want.
George, something happen when I arrived.
Did you ever go to a totally strange place and feel from the very first moment that you'd been there before?
Because that's what happened to me.
It's absurd I know.
The feeling so strong thatà
I can't think of anything else.
I've always in the past, wanted to see what it was all about.
To see what was on the other side of the mountain.
Perhaps this is it.
It's likeà coming home.
Well with me, it's the complete reverse.
I can't wait to get back.
But I'll tell you want.
If I, mind my manners and don't rock the boat, will you seriously think about getting out of here, soon.
All right, we'll have a truce.
Till we find out about this place.
And then if we get out here...
If?
Did I say if?
Yes, you did.
Can I ask you a question?
Were we brought here on purpose?
Over 2000 people live in the valley.
And if so, what is the purpose.
In addition to those here in Shangri-Laà
What is Shangri-La?
Who is he? You.
Good heavens, no.
Not I.
Well who, for instance.
In time, you will know.
You know for a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
There are some things my dear Conway, that I deeply regret
I cannot discuss.
Shall we continue?
You know, in the outside world, you'd be a knockout.
I bet people would fight to see you dance.
I fear I shall never see you're outside world.
Never see it? Why ever not?
It is not possible.
Am I then, in some way on trial dear Mr. Chang.
Oh no, like everyone else you are on a pilgrimage through life.
By chance, out of your voyage of discovery, is here.
By chance?
Here of course, we have more time for reflection.
Sickness is unknown.
Perfect health is the rule.
And it is quite common for us to live to a very ripe old age.
Indeed.
And does that also apply to those who come here from the outside world.
If it did not, Shangri-La would never have been built.
How old it is your oldest inhabitants?
Um? Let me see?
Considerably over 100 years old.
Considerably.
Yes, still at work, when last I spoke to him.
Climate and diet, these are important of course to keep you young.
But we believe it is the lack of struggle in our way of life.
How often in your countries do you hear the expression,
"He worried himself to death." or " this thing or that thing killed him."
Your lives are, as a rule shorter.
Not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
Unfortunately true.
"Climate, diet, and harmony." you said.
And somewhere the guiding mind.
Is that it?
Is it not enough?
What worries me is that it's a little like a dream, from which I shall shorty, but unpleasantly, awake.
You surprised me.
I surprised you?
Yes, as you who have written so much of better worlds should think it a dream when you find one.
Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it.
And this is our school.
This is where we start to prepare our young for the future.
Why. Why. Why. Why. Why. Why.

? Are in the circle that never begins. ?
? Nobody knows where the circle ends. ?
? La-la-la
La la la, la la-la la. ?
? The world is a circle that never begins. ?
? Nobody knows where the circle ends. ?
- Oh.
- Children.
Thank you.
Sometime in the future, you shall have the pleasure of meeting her.
Sam, Sam I had the strangest dream last night.
I dreamt I swallowed a
50 pound marshmallow.
And when I woke up my pillow was gone.
- You're getting better.
- I thought so.
- You go on. I'll be with you in a minute.
- OK, hurry it up.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were alone.
What is it?
Lovett had a deck of cards.
I thought you'd... might like to play a game.
Some other time, huh?
Sure.
I didn't think I could hold a card.
Why am I like this?
It helps talking to you.
My little cold knot in my stomach starts easing up.
My memory keeps coming back, that Ià really considered dropping off this balcony.
Would you have done so?
I don't know.
If Chang hadn't called, then maybe I would.
That's what frightens me.
What's happened to me?
Perhaps you can answer that yourself.
Sally, "Golden Girl."
I was always taught, dreams could come true.
That's terrific to believe when you're a kid.
A little more difficult later on when you're a "little more difficult."
All that passionate involvement.
Men, causes.
Going around agonizing about man's inhumanity to man.
I made a good living out of taking pictures of people with their heads blown off.
So other people with their heads still on and usually under hair dryers could get a kick out of them before turning to the nearest recipe.
One day it all made me sick.
The dreams were over.
That is very painful but, also necessary so that you may take the next step.
The next step was to start taking pills to get the dreams back.
The excitement, the loving, the feeling good ones.
The kicks I got, lasted about two and a half minutes.
So you find out, that's not the answer either.
And now?
Nothing.
- The end of the line.
- No!
You had the courage, not to jump.
Which means?
You must tell me.
Answers!
Where the hell are any answers!
I don't know!
Try Miss. Hughes.
Inside me I guess. Is that it?
It would not be wrong to start there.
- May I help you with some tea Mr. Conway?
- Thank you.
Let me see. 19 plus 187 gives me a grand total ofà two hundred and six.
You know if you hadn't told me you were honest Harry,
I'd swear you were cheating.
Of course I'm cheating Sampson, and getting away with it.
I mean there's no fun playing cards if you don't.
And the rest of us, are we all as content as we seem here orà is there some delicious drug in our food?
Or is all this, a mirage?
No, no no no my dear Mr. Conway, we employ no such methods in Shangri-La.
To put it simply, we believe in moderation.
We teach that virtue lies in avoiding excess.
We rule with moderates strictness.
In return we are satisfied with moderate obedience.
As a result our people are moderately sober.
Moderately chase and err... moderately honest.
Then you're more than moderately fortunate.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Well, I brought you this.
Oh, thank you.
- May I look at it?
- Yes.
Do you ever have arguments over women?
Oh, only very rarely.
You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
And supposing somebody wanted some particular woman so badly, he didn't care whether it was good manners or not.
Well in that event.
It would be good manners on the part of the other man...
To ehà
Yes?
To let him have her.
That's very convenient.
I think I like that.
And ah, does this arrangement applied for women also?
Of course. You'd be surprised Mr. Conway how a little courtesy all around can help to smooth out the most complicated problems.
Thank you.
- Hope it has a happy ending.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Excuse me.
Just a minute.
Yes Mr. Conway.
I'mà in a quandary and ahà
I thought thatà you might be able to help me.
I noticed you are having your course in elementary Chang.
What is your problem?
Well, Chang tells me that as soon as I meet a woman I like
I must be prepared to give her up if somebody else likes her as well and I don't think I'm capable of doing that.
- When that happensà
- I think it has.
When that happens the important thing is to try and make theà other fellow, the one who must be courteous.
I see, I hadn't thought of it like that.
Perhaps you could help me with some other questions.
I have so many I hardly know where to begin.
You want to know who I am and what I'm doing here.
- My name is Catherine and I was born here.
- Were you?
Well, almost born here. It was just beyond the pass.
My parents were explorers who couldn't rest until they had seen everything.
Unfortunately, they died just on the other side.
And Chang rescued you.
Fateful Chang, he and his men found me barely alive.
Here I've grown up and here I've been happy.
With no desire to leave.
Absolutely none.
So I should know a good thing when I see it.
Is that it?
That's it.
Goodnight Mr. Conway.
Well my friends you have seen our mountains our valley and our people.
You've heard about our past, now you are seeing our future.
This is our Festival
Of The Family.

Mmmmm, ?
Hi.
Ah, improving your mind again eh?
You should try it.
Yes.
Yes, maybe you're right.
Then perhaps I can understand what it is about this place that the rest of you seem to enjoy so much.
Tell me, don't you ever give a thought to leaving here?
No. I donÆt know what you left behind but what I left behind, I'm not in such a hurry to see again.
Aw.
Don't listen to her Maria.
She was born to be a recluse.
Hello Maria. I saw you dance at the ceremony, and you were lovely.
Thank you.
I've read these and I've come back for more.
I wonder what will happen when we've read them all.
We'll be about 250 and need new glasses.
You sound like you hate the outside world.
- Do you?
- Well I don't love it.
But what about London and Paris?
And the Greek islands and the Leningrad Ballet.
You mean compared to hear? Oh,
Maria you must be kidding.
Look what you got, plus all the time the world to enjoy it.
Time, à Yes there is time.
Before George came, it didn't seem strange to spend my days in reading.
Talk to myself, dance.
Drift through the days full of nothing but peace and quiet.
It didn't seem too long, but it's different now.
Oh boy, good old George.
Take it from me Maria, Shangri-La has a definite edge over New York City, not to mention
Calcutta and the rest.
But the way George describes it.
Listen Marie, George is a nice guy and I don't mean to knock him, but don't let him kid you there's some sort of wonderland outside.
So all you have is peace and quiet uh-uh.
You have a place here where you can breathe.
Where no violence, no cruelty.
A place where people will take the time to care.
George can have his rat race.
I can do without it.
? On the list of the things that I will not miss ?
? First of all is noise ?
? On the list of the things that I will not miss ?
? Is peace and quiet ?
? I would like to try it ?
? Different people look at life from different points of view ?
? If you really want the things
I have just help yourself ?
? I give it all to you ?
? On the list of the things that I will not miss ?
? I would mention crowds ?
? On the list of the things that I will not miss ?

You know, those girls would be great in my new act.
They should be so lucky.
You look beautiful.
Thanks. I guess.
Oh I mean, you looked beautiful before but now, you look beautiful.
Tomorrow I got something to tell you.
What's wrong with today?
I can't now, it's a secret.
Alright.
I'm afraid that truces over.
Why?
If we don't get it straight now we never will.
Get what straight?
Who wants to leave, and when and how.
For start, I want you to tell them what you told me.
That we were brought here deliberately.
And what's the point.
They're perfectly happy.
They won't be when they find out.
Will you tell them?
No, and certainly not tonight.
Then I will.
Listen everybody.
My brother wants to explode a small bomb but
I think I better do it.
Sit down George.
Do you realize that we are all prisoners here?
No we're not, we're guest.
We were deliberately kidnapped.
- What is this?
- You have no proof of that.
The pilot of a plane was a man from Shangri-La.
- May have been.
- Stop glossing over the facts.
I want to get out of here.
I can't do it alone
I need to know if anyone else feels as I do?
Well, does anyone else want to leave.
Mr. Conway? Mr. Conway.
Ask him if you don't believe me.
Why were we kidnapped and brought here Mr. Chang?
Mr. Conway I'd bring you extraordinary news.
Answer the question.
- Let him go. - Richard! - Let him go!
Mr. Chang,
Forgive my brother's determination to force the issue.
You've been very kind and we appreciate it.
But I think the time has come for you to be more open with us.
Were we brought here deliberately and if so why?
There is no time to answer questions now Mr. Conway.
You must come at once. The
High Lama wishes to see you.
Who is the High Lama?
I thought you ran this place Chang.
Oh no, I'm only a humbled member of the community.
- Please Mr. Conway, you mustà
- Just a minute.
Will your High Lama answer our questions?
That is possible.
Then he's the man that I want to see.
Richard?
Tell him that, I at least intend to leave here.
I was here for five years before I was called.
You cannot appreciate the overwhelming honor that has been bestowed upon you.
It is unprecedented.
Good evening Mr. Conway.
Please come in.
Sit down near me.
I trust, you have been comfortable at Shangri-La since you arrival.
I've liked it very much.
But some of my friends and in particularly my brother are puzzled by the mystery.
I can understand that Mr. Conway.
Perhaps if I told you of Shangri-La's origins things would become clearer.
Thank you.
A Belgian priest named
Father Perrault was was the first European to enter the valley of the Blue Moon.
When was that?
Was the year 1747.
When Father Perrault tumbled into the valley half frozen to death, one of his legs was so badly frostbitten, there being no doctor he was forced to amputate it himself.
- He amputated his own leg?
- Yes.
Oddly enough, later, when the natives came to trust him.
He learned from them that his leg would have healed without amputation.
- With frostbite that's impossible.
- Oh no.
This valley celebrates the natural life.
And he recovered well.
Soon he was making his way around the valley taking a great interest in everything.
He taught his own religion and the best of others.
Instructing the children knowing how important education would be for future generations.
He began building the
Lamasery of Shangri-La with one or two helpers.
But after some years hundreds of the natives who by now had come to respect him helped with the task.
When it was finished he was 108 years old.
He's life works is over.
He became weak and lay in his room for many weeks between life and death.
And then a strange thing happened.
He had a vision of the purpose of Shangri-La, of its entire meaning.
And of his part in it.
From that moment on he began to recover.
And how old was he when he died?
But that's incredible!
Yes my son.
You're still alive
Father Perrault.
Sit down my son.
You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Of mine, Father?
Oh, not the Richard Conway, the public hero, the government servant but the Richard Conway who once wrote,
"There are moments in every man's life when he glimpses the eternal."
That man seemed to belong here.
In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
So I was right, we were brought here.
But, what possible use could I be to an already thriving community?
If this community is to continue to thrive, then we need men like you here.
You can work today.
Is there anything more pitiful.
Will surely this is a time of crisis.
But when has the world known any other time.
What madness there is what blindness, what unintelligent leadership.
A furiously harassing marshall, bewildered, humanities, strengthening, not in wisdom but in vulgar passions.
The time must come when evil will destroy itself.
I will not live to see that day.
But you might, my son.
And that is why you have been brought to Shangri-La.
For when the day comes, that the world begins to look for a new life, it is our belief that they will find a reservoir of hope here.
So here we shall stay with our books and our music.
And our medications.
Here we shall be, to guide the footsteps of a weary people.
Here we shall be with our way of life.
There's only one simple rule, à be kind.
And it is our hope that our brotherly love will then spread throughout the world.
And when the strong have devoured each other, then, at lastà the meek shall inherit the earth.
I am tired now my son.
Will you come again?
Yes I will.
? How do I know this is part of my real life? ?
? If there's no pain can
I be sure I feel life? ?
? And would I go back if
I knew how to go back? ?
? What good is time when you're sure of tomorrow? ?
? Can there be joy where there has been no sorrow? ?
? And would I go back if
I knew how to go back? ?
? Will I find there is really such a thing as peace of mind, ?
? and what I thought was living was truly just confusion, ?
? the chance to live forever is really no illusion, ?
? and this all can be mine? ?
? Why can't I make myself believe it? ?
? Can I accept what
I see around me? ?
? Have I found Shangri-La, or has it found me? ?
? And would I go back if
I knew how to go back? ?
? Will I find there is really such a thing as peace of mind, ?
? and what I thought was living was truly just confusion, ?
? the chance to live forever is really no illusion, ?
? and this all can be mine? ?
? Why can't I make myself believe it? ?
? There are things that you see. ?
? Other things you feel. ?
? Feelings can't be seen yet we never doubt they are real. ?
? When you search for the truth don't just use your eyes. ?
? Look inside yourself that is where the truth always lies. ?
? Where knowledge ends faith begins, ?
? and it shines like a star, ?
? till your heart fills with hope and with love. ?
? I have looked in your heart. ?
? I have faith in you. ?
No not there.
I apologize for being away so long.
Well, did you ask aboutà- What was he like? - Richard, did you see him?
Yes.
I saw the High Lama.
And I haven't the answers to all of our questions yet, but I will in time.
And when I do I'll tell you exactly what the situation is.
Particularly about going home.
Until then you all have to trust me.
Come on, come on,
Oh my lord.
- There, gold, the stream is full of it.
- So?
We can smuggle it out. Get those porters to help us.
Correction, you bribe the porters,
I got something better to do.
Such as?
Such as not sitting around worrying about how to spend money in a place where money isn't any good.
But what about when we get out?
Get out, how? Sam you gotta' be more practical.
Trouble with you is you haven't got any inner resources.
Who hasn't? What are you trying to tell me?
Your life is made up of infinite possibilities and you're not realizing one of them.
- Not one.
- For instance?
? When you look at yourself do you like what you see? ?
? If you like what you see, you're the person you should be. ?
? 'Cause your reflection reflects in everything you do, ?
? and everything you do reflects on you. ?
? When you wake up each day do you like how you feel? ?
? If you like how you feel, you've got nothing to conceal. ?
? 'Cause your reflection reflects in everything you do, ?
? and everything you do reflects on you. ?
? Doing something for someone else isn't really for someone else. ?
? It does twice as much for you as something you do just for yourself. ?
? When you lay down to sleep do you like all your dreams? ?
? If you like all your dreams, life's as happy as it seems. ?
? 'Cause your reflection reflects in everything you do, ?
? and everything you do reflects on you. ?
Now you said the other night that these farms around here need better irrigation.
Well you were an engineer, go irrigate them.
Yea!
Excuse me, I was looking for your brother.
He's not here.
She seems to be quite taken with him.
Let's hope that beautiful young women can talk more sense into him than I can.
You spoke of her as young.
My dear friend I hate to dissolution you.
But you must not be deceived by her appearance.
Our way of life has preserved her youth and her beauty.
She came here when she was 20.
She was on her wedding journey but her carriers lost their way in the mountains and the whole party would have perished but for meeting our people.
They brought her here.
That was many, many years ago.
How many?
You are more beautiful than the women of Thailand.
More feminine than the women of France.
More pliable than the women of Japan.
- Moreà
- Stop. Stop.
I don't want to hear about all these other women.
All I want to hear is that, you won't leave me.
Oh, I adore you.
But, I can't stay here.
There's so much I want to do with my life that, I can't do here.
Maria, if I could find a way, would you come back with me?
- There is no way.
- Well there has to be!
Tomorrow I'm going out to the pass that leads out of here, to see if its guarded.
And to look for those porters.
If they exist.
They exist.
They do?
Then why didn't you tell me before?
I hoped you would become contented, like the others.
Con-Contented?
Oh...
Look, I have to get out of here.
Please, will you come with me?
Would you stay with me here if I said no?
Then I will come with you.
The water starts up in the hills all right but about halfway down it's starts going the wrong way.
Now if we put a dam here and these interconnecting bamboo pipes you'd have the whole valley. You'd have the entire mountainside.
And just watch that stuff grow. And no more women carrying buckets of water.
- Sam you're excited.
- Yeah, yeah.
I guess it's been a long time.
- A longtime what?
- Oh, since I was so excited.
And involved.
A long time ago I used to work the land.
I guess I got waylaid somewhere along the line.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
- Come on.
- Forget it. I don't wanna talk about it.
Sam, I'm interested.
Okay, does the name Simon
Causefield mean anything to you?
Causefield...
- Yeah, didn't heà
- That's me.
I remember American
Consolidated Products.
And the thing fell apart. You were gone and the money was too.
I wasn't there because there wasn't any money! And it wasn't my fault!
I'd worked hard and made a little bit.
That little bit became a lot.
So I built a corporation. It became a lot of corporations.
I was a hero.
It was the American dream.
Everybody wanted in.
I did ask them to, nobody told them to buy, they just did.
Overnight the balloon burst.
The next day I'm the biggest crook that the country has ever seen.
I don't know what to do.
So I started running.
Anywhere I think that they won't find me.
That's how I ended up in Baskul.
Maybe here the running can stop.
Maybe.
Samà
I stopped running here, you can too.
Il pleut, il pleut, bergÞre.
Il pleut, il pleut, bergÞre.
Look, uh-uh-uh, I-I don't know a thing about teaching.
- C'mon you're going to have toà
- Mouton.
- Il pleut, il pleut, à
- All you have to do is to follow me.
Come along with me.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Catherine has to leave you, so I want to introduce you to your new teacher of the day.
Your new expert Mr. Lovett.
Yea.
Well now, there you are, here
I am, and ah, where are we?
Ah, success. You think that was funny folks,
'You ain't heard nothing yet.'
- Now what are you learning?
- French.
French. Well that lets me out.
'I know nothing about French.'.
A teacher should only teach what he knows at all I know is ah, Show Business
I don't think they'd approve.
You know when I was a kid, the thing that got me was that every teacher I ever had, only ask me questions and expected answers.
You too? Well I'll tell you what I think.
Any dummy can know the answers. It's the smart ones that know the questions.
? Question me an answer bright and clear. ?
? I will answer with a question clear and bright. ?
? Even though your answer may be ?
? wrong my question will be right. ?
? Question me an answer. ?
? Answer with a question. ?
? Fourteen hundred ninety two. ?
? What's the year that Babe Ruth hit his sixtieth home run? ?
? Wellington at Waterloo. ?
? Who became the hero at the battle of Bull Run? ?
? Learning can be lots of fun. ?
? Question me an answer bright and clear. ?
? I will answer with a question clear and bright. ?
? Even though your answer may be ?
? wrong my question will be right. ?
? Question me an answer. ?
? Answer with a question. ?
? Midnight ride of Paul Revere. ?
? What's the way that Yankee
Doodle really went to town? ?
? Cleaning up the atmosphere. ?
? What's the reason London
Bridge is always falling down. ?
? You can learn things from a clown. ?
? Question me an answer bright and clear. ?
? I will answer with a question clear and bright. ?
? Even though your answer may be ?
? wrong my question will be right. ?
? Question me an answer. ?
? Answer with a question. ?
? On the good ship Lollypop. ?
? How did Christopher
Columbus sail upon the sea? ?
? Underneath the circus top. ?
? Where did Cleopatra get to meet Mark Antony? ?
? They say knowledge makes you free. ?
? They say knowledge makes you free. ?
? Question me an answer if you please. ?
? I will answer with a question if I can. ?
? Let me show you just how I became an educated man. ?
? Question me an answer. ?
? Answer with a question. ?
? If you wanna' know, if you wanna' hear, if you wanna' see, ?
? question me an answer. ?
Harry, what are you doing?
You hear that? They love me!
They love me.
It's beautiful.
It's also inconceivable.
Father Perrault, his story andà
This place hidden away from the rest of the world.
Then you come along and confuse me even more.
- Am I so strange?
- No you're not.
Nothing here is strange.
And that's what's so confusing.
I'm desperately trying to keep myà emotional feedingsà and my spiritual needs from clobbering each other to death.
You're very beautiful.
And very desirable.
But like everything else beautiful that's happened to me here.
I find it remarkable thatà it has happened to me here and not out there.
You know, I can't explain it but, à everything seems familiar.
This air, à
Those beautiful gardens, you,
This lamasery with its feet rooted in a good earth of this fertile valley.
While its head explores the eternal.
And I've been kidnappedà
Brought here against my will which is a crime, a great crime.
And yet I accepted it as, one would accept an act performed by a very dear friend.
Can you tell me why?
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I'm certain there's a, wish for
Shangri-La in everyone's heart.
I've never seen you're outside world but I imagine it's full of millions of people who secretly wish to be in a beautiful place like this.
Well if they were, it wouldn't be beautiful for long.
For years I hoped that someone like you would come and share these moments with me.
But now you're here you're not as I pictured you.
What did you expect?
From your books some uh, Saintly Hero.
Almost astatic.
And much less attractive.
Well, people who worship heroes must be prepared for disillusionment.
But, I shall become saintly immediately.
Just, to please you.
Did you ever thinkà
What did you expect? Or hope?
I imagined she'd be just like you.
I come to youà with all my hopes and
I bring you love.
I come to youà
All my life I searched for something rare.
A love that I could share.
? I come to you with all my dreams and I bring you love. ?
? I come to you. ?
? There were times my faith in life was gone, ?
? still I continued on. ?
? Those endless days turned into years. ?
? They were lonely years in many ways. ?
? And deep inside I'm sure I always knew I had to wait for you. ?
? And here you are, my own true love. ?
? I come to you. ?
? Happy birthday to you ?
? Happy birthday to you ?
? Happy birthday dear Harry ?
? Happy birthday to you ?
Thank you. Thank you my friends.
Old friends.
And new friends.
And a special thank you to Sally for arranging the candles.
Twenty one how'd you guess?
Well, here we go.
Yea.
Well, this is a pretty happy day for me.
Not just because it's my birthday but ah, because I've come to a big decision.
I've decided to stay in Shangri-La.
If they'll have me.
Good that's fine.
Now wait a minute. Hold it.
I hope Mr. Chang that you'll go along with a great idea I've got.
I shall be most interested to hear it Mr. Lovett.
Well Mr. Chang I know
I speak for all of us
I say that ahà this place is terrific.
I don't worry here, and I sleep well.
Confidentially I've had some pretty rough times lately.
Few bookings and audiences wellà
They weren't throwing bread, they sat on their hands.
But ah, these kids hereà
They ah...
They love me.
You know I took a little personal inventory about 10:30 last night, just before going to sleep.
And I said to myself.
"Harry Lovette things are going pretty well for a change."
And they are, so why not go for a run of the play contract. Right?
Well down in school those kids,
Terrific kids you got here Mr. Chang.
They're very imaginative.
They keep imitating me.
Wanting to be like me.
I thought it might be a good idea to give them a course in dramatics.
Teach them to sing and dance, you know sort of that, 'Big Time Stuff.'
But ah, would that be all right with you Mr. Chang?
Can I stay?
Watch it Mr. Chang he's liable to cause chaos in that school.
I don't think so.
We have a saying,
"The trees that bend a little to the harmless breeze, will later grow to withstand the wild wind."
Uh?
We shall be most honored to have you Mr. Lovett.
Oh, great great great.
Now, I'll cut the cake.
Chang!
I wanna' talk with you Mr. Chang.
That famous tribe of porter's expected for two years that will take us all out of here whenever they arrive.
Well, I've just discovered they have arrived, three days ago.
And there was never any intention that they should take us out of here.
Isn't that right Mr. Chang?
I'm going with them Richard.
As for the rest of you well, think about it.
Mr. Conway.
My friend you must not let him go.
The porters could only take him a certain distance.
Beyond that is a wilderness for which he would never get out alive.
You should have told me the porters where here.
I could have prepared him for this.
Talk to him.
I'll try, I don't think he'll listen to me.
Richard.
Richard.
Be careful. He will want you to go with him.
Well.
What shall I do Catherine?
Go and talk to Father Perrault.
Yes, I will.
And I need your help Father, to stop him from leaving.
I am no longer able to help you.
The responsibility is yours.
My sonà
I'm going to die.
I wish to place in your hands, the future and destiny of Shangri-La.
I knew my work was done when
I first set eyes upon you.
I'd been waiting for you for a long time.
I've sat in this room and seen the faces of many newcomers.
I've looked into their eyes and heard their voices.
Always in the hope that I might find you.
It's not an honest task that I bequeathed.
For our order knows no rigid bonds.
To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to reside here in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
It will be such a one my son as the world has not seen before.
There will be no safety by arms.
No help from authority.
No answer in science.
It will rage till every flower of culture is trampled and all human beings are leveled in a loss chaos.
Ask yourself, has it not already begun?
Do you, really believe that I'll live to see the end of the storm?
I do. That is why it is you who must preserve the fragrance of our history and add to it, a touch of your own mind.
You netà
Ià
My vision weakens.
I can see, the great distance.
A new world stirring in the ruins.
Stirring clumsily but in hopefulness.
Seeking its lost and legendary treasures.
They will all be here my son.
Hidden behind the mountains in the Valley Of The Blue Moon.
Preserve in Shangri-La.
I see... my... miracle.
And that's the story.
He said, " I place in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La."
I now know that
I found the answers to all the confusion of the world that has plagued me for a long time.
I found what I'm searching forà
I don't know what to say to you.
Do you really believe everything he told you?
Yes, I do.
Without any proof?
The proof is in the man himself.
In everything I've felt.
Here, from the beginning.
Doesn't the story mean anything to you?
What could it mean to me?
You're right George. This is no place for you.
And you should realize it's no place for you either.
You're needed in the outside world where the problems are far more urgent and pressing than they are here in Shangri-La.
Here, here you just marking time.
Besides think of your obligations to the U.N.
I know the obligations.
I know.
But I've found peace here.
And I've found love.
And I must hold on to it.
I'm going to pack and see to the others.
Richard, I beg you to think again.
And change your mind.
George, I'm staying.
Sorry.
I'm very sorry.
I shall miss you. So will a lot of other people.
So you won't be lonely, I've talked to the rest of them.
They're staying too.
So it'll be just Maria and me.
Maria, what she got to do with it?
She's coming with me.
- You can't take her away.
- Why not?
Don't you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La?
She'll begin to live the happiest part of her life. That's what will happen.
She'll begin to live the last moments of her life.
Her beauty isà
She must stay here where she's safe.
She's young and strong, she'll manage the trip all right.
George listen, she can't make that trip.
She's not young and strong. Chang told me that she came here, à
80 years ago.
Eighty?
What are you talking about?
Oh come on Richard, you can't believe that.
You've seen her, she's not a day over 20.
Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
I see. And what if she leaves Shangri-La?
Chang said she would quickly revert to her actual age.
And you must believe it.
Look, will you believe me if I prove you're wrong?
And will you then see that, if I'm right about Maria,
I'm probably right about the rest too.
I'll die if I have to stay here alone now.
George promised he wouldn't leave me.
If it weren't for me you'd never get out.
It was I who bribed the porters.
They were forbidden by the High
Lama to take any one out of here.
- Is it true?
- I was with her.
They only took the bribe because he's dead now.
But aren't you afraid to leave? You know what will happen if you go.
Happen?
Ah, I suppose Chang told you that I am old.
That is part of the myth of Shangri-La.
Chang did tell you didn't he.
Yes.
Look at me Mr. Conway,
Do I look like an old woman?
Is this the skin of an old woman?
Are these the eyes of an old woman?
And in my heart, are these the feedings of an old woman?
Do you believe I have been here for 80 years?
Like us, she was kidnapped.
They brought her here just two years ago.
Well I don't believe it. I can't believe it. She's lying.
You're lying every word you said is a lie.
Now come on admit it.
What reason would
I have for lying?
Look Mr. Conway, the chances are, we will never live through this terrible journey.
But, I would rather go out there with George, and die in a snowstorm than stay here one minute more.
But why have they told me this story!
Because they need you here.
Sally and the others have already found ways to be useful,
But you're the one they were after, you had to be convinced.
But your job isn't here and you must realize that now.
Are you telling me the truth?
I am 20 years old and I was brought here two years ago.
I'm going to need your help on this journey.
We both are.
Please come with us Richard.
I believe her.
Humph.
I once said to Chang that I was afraid this was a dream from which I might suddenly and unhappily awake.
All right, I'll come with you.
Catherine!
Catherine?
To Len.
- Yes Mr. Conway.
- Where's Catherine?
Chang has given orders that she cannot be disturbed.
But where is she,
I must see her.
I regret that is not possible Mr. Conway.
Richard! Richard come on.
I can't find Catherine.
I'm sorry, but the porters won't wait.
Richard, the porters won't wait.
I hope they make it.
Doesn't tempt you, does it Harry?
Not me Sam.
We can still go with them if you want to.
What's happened?
Where's Richard?
He's leaving my child.
- Leaving?!
- But, he will return.
Richard!
Richard!
Richard.
Richard, hurry!
Richard!
Richard!
Richard!
Richard.
[Hundunn!]
Can't you get them to wait.
They're leaving us father behind everyday.
They're only trying to save themselves.
We're too slow.
I am sorry. I cannot go faster.
I cannot move faster.
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey! Hey!
[Hoodelee]
Aahh!
Richard.
Help me.
I must rest. I cannot go on any longer.
I must rest!
I'll carry her.
Richard? Richard!
Richard, her-her face!
Look at her face!
There's a cave over there.
Help me.
There.
Ugh.
No!
No!
- Oh no!
- George!
No no!
- George!
- No!
Aaaahh!
Aah!
Doctor.
How are you Mr. Conway?
I dreamt for a moment that I was back again.
Back again? Where?
Where?
How are you feeling?
I don't know whether I've been mad, and now sane or,
I was sane for a time and now mad again.
Mr. Conway.
How do you know my name?
The whole world knows your name and wonders what happened to you?
You were flying back from a U.N. peace mission when your plane disappeared.
Peace mission.
- Did we succeeded?
- Sadly no.
But there's always hope.
Yes hope.
It must be that.
Mr. Ferguson, I'm Dr. Verden.
I told Conway you're coming.
- Oh good. This is my associate Theo Murphy.
- How do you do.
- Dr..
- Please come with me.
Follow me.
When the tribesmen found him wandering in the lower valley, he was totally lost.
Suffering from snow blindness and near starvation.
Despite this, they had a hard time getting him to the village.
So keen was he to get back into the mountains.
To get to this place called Shangri-La.
Shangri-La. Yes, that was in your report.
- But do you think...?
- You'll hear about it from him.
Come.
Where he is he?
I'm afraid you arrived too late.
He's gone.
Gone?
Shangri-La.
On and on he talked about this fantastic place.
He must return. He must return!
Obviously right now that's what he's trying to do.
But I've got to find him.
It's my job to take him home.
Your job won't be easy Mr. Ferguson, even if you do find him.
This, obsession if you will, kept him alive in the wilderness, beyond all human endurance.
Even here his convalescence is do less to medicine, than to that, all consuming passion to return.
In Richard Conway's mind,
Shangri-La represents the ultimate way of life.
It's ah, Shangri-La.
Do you believe it?
Yes, I believe it.
I believe it, because
I want to believe it.
? There's a Lost Horizon, ?
? waiting to be found. ?
? There's a Lost Horizon ?

"In the decade of the 1930s even the great city of Metropolis...
"... was not spared the ravages of the worldwide depression.
"In the times of fear and confusion...
"... the job of informing the public was the responsibility...
"... of the Daily Planet.
"A great metropolitan newspaper...
"... whose reputation for clarity and truth had become a symbol of hope...
"... for the city of Metropolis."
This is no fantasy.
No careless product of wild imagination.
No, my good friends...
...these indictments...
...I've brought you today...
...specific charges listed herein against the individuals...
...their acts of treason.
Their ultimate aim of sedition.
These...
...are matters of undeniable fact.
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...
...on those accused.
On this...
...this mindless aberration...
...whose only means of expression are wanton violence and destruction.
On the woman, Ursa...
...whose perversions and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...
...have threatened even the children of the Planet Krypton.
Finally, General Zod.
Once trusted by this Council...
...charged with maintaining the defense of the Planet Krypton itself.
Chief Architect of this intended revolution and author of this insidious plot...
...to establish a new order amongst us...
...with himself as absolute ruler.
You have heard the evidence.
The decision of the Council will now be heard.
Guilty!
Guilty!
Guilty!
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.
It has therefore now become your decision.
You alone will condemn us if you wish...
...and you alone will be held responsible by me!
Join us!
You have been known to disagree with the Council before.
Yours could become an important voice in the new order, second only to my own!
I offer you a chance for greatness, Jor-El!
Take it! Join us!
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.
I swear it!
No matter that it takes an eternity!
You will bow down before me!
Both you and then one day...
...your heirs!
Forgive me, forgive me...
An unpleasant duty has been masterly performed, Jor-El.
They have received the fate they deserved.
Isolation in the Phantom Zone...
...an eternal living death.
A chance for life, nonetheless.
As opposed to us.
It's suicide.
No, it's worse, it's genocide.
Be warned, Jor-El.
The Council has already evaluated this outlandish theory of yours.
My friends, you know me to be neither rash nor impulsive.
I am not given to wild unsupported statements...
...and I tell you that we must evacuate this planet immediately.
Jor-El, you are one of Krypton's greatest scientists.
Yes, but so is Vond-Ah.
I don't question your data.
The facts are undeniable.
It's your conclusions we find unsupportable.
This planet will explode within 30 days.
If not sooner.
I tell you Krypton is simply shifting its orbit.
Jor-El...
...be reasonable.
My friend...
...I have never been otherwise.
This madness is yours.
This discussion is terminated.
The decision of the Council is final.
Any attempt by you to create...
...a climate of fear and panic among the populace...
...must be deemed by us an act of insurrection.
You would accuse me of insurrection?
Has it now become a crime to cherish life?
You would be banished to endless imprisonment...
...in the Phantom Zone:
The eternal void...
...which you, yourself discovered.
Will you abide by the Council's decision?
I will remain silent.
Neither I, nor my wife...
...will leave Krypton.
Have you finished?
Nearly.
It's the only answer, Lara.
If he remains here with us...
...he will die as surely as we will.
But why Earth, Jor-El?
They're primitives, thousands of years behind us.
He will need that advantage to survive.
Their atmosphere will...
...sustain him.
He will defy their gravity.
He will look like one of them.
He won't be one of them.
No.
His dense molecular structure will make him strong.
He'll be odd. Different.
He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.
Isolated. Alone.
He will not be alone.
He will never be alone.
The energy input to Jor-El's quarters is now in excess.
Our data indicates the loss is due to a misuse of energy.
Investigate.
And if the investigation proves correct?
He knew the penalty he faced.
He even is a member of this Council.
The law will be upheld.
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.
But we will never leave you.
Even in the face of our death...
...the richness of our lives...
...shall be yours.
All that I have, all that I've learned, everything I feel...
...all this and more, I...
...I bequeath you, my son.
You will carry me inside you...
...all the days of your life.
You will make my strength your own...
...see my life through your eyes...
...as your life will be seen through mine.
The son becomes the father, and the father...
...the son.
This is all I...
...all I can send you, Kal-El.
...which Einstein called his theory of relativity.
Embedded in the crystals before you...
...is the total accumulation of all literature and scientific fact from dozens...
...of other worlds...
...spanning the 28 known galaxies.
Early Chinese writings point out the complex relationship...
By carrying this complex equation to its ultimate power, my son...
Chief among these powers will be your sight...
...your strength, your hearing...
...your ability to propel yourself at almost limitless speed.
The early history of our universe was a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.
Each of the six galaxies which you will pass through...
...contain their own individual law of space and time.
It is forbidden for you to interfere with human history.
- What!
- What was that?
Now wouldn't that beat all get out.
Well, you...
Oh, Pa!
Oh, my.
All these years, as happy as we've been...
...how I've prayed the good Lord would see fit to give us a child.
Honey, will you hand me that rag up there.
You take things easy now.
Remember what Doc Frye said about that heart of yours.
Now the first thing we've got to do when we get home is find out...
...who that boy's proper family is.
He hasn't got any.
Not around here, anyway.
Are you thinking what I think you are thinking?
We could say he's the child of my cousin in North Dakota...
...and just now orphaned.
Jonathan, he's only a baby.
Martha, now you saw how we found him.
Martha Clark Kent, are you listening to what I'm saying?
Come on, gang.
That was a great game.
All right.
Come on, hustle, let's go.
Stack your helmets neatly.
Remember about the uniforms, cleaned and washed...
...by tomorrow, and looking like a football team.
Let's have those clothes washed and ready for tomorrow's game.
Got to beat Mount Vernon High.
Can you give me a lift?
Lana?
Don't bother with these.
I'll take them in with the other equipment.
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.
Listen, a whole bunch of us are going up to Mary Ellen's.
Play some records.
Would you like to come?
Sure.
Sounds like it could be a lot of fun.
Kent can't make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.
What are you talking about?
I've just finished stacking...
All that?
Oh, Brad!
Hey, come on, Lana.
Come on, let's go.
- He has to clean up.
- 'Bye, Clark.
- 'Bye, Lana.
- Clean this up, Clark.
'Bye, Clark.
'Bye, Clark.
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.
Golly! I saw a boy out there run as fast as the train!
Faster, even!
Lois Lane, you have a writer's gift for invention.
- I'll say that for you.
- But...
Lois, please read your book.
No one ever believes me.
Hey, look, there's Clark!
Clark?
How did you get here so fast?
I ran.
Ran, huh?
Told you he was an oddball, let's get out of here.
Been showing off a bit, haven't you, Son?
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.
It's just that guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know I shouldn't.
Yeah, I know you can do all these amazing things...
...and sometimes you think that you will just go bust...
...unless you can tell people about it.
- Yeah.
- That's right.
I mean, every time I get the football
I can make a touchdown.
- That's for sure.
- Every time.
Is it showing off when somebody's doing the things he's capable of doing?
Is a bird showing off when it flies?
No, now, you listen to me.
When you came to us, we thought...
...people would take you away...
...when they found out the things that you do.
It worried us a lot.
Then when a man gets older and he thinks very differently.
And things get very clear.
And there's one thing I do know, Son, and that is you are here for a reason.
I don't know whose reason, or whatever the reason is...
...maybe it's because...
I don't know.
But I do know one thing.
It's not to score touchdowns.
Thanks, Dad.
I'll race you to it. Yeah.
You will?
Run. Come on, come on. Move, move.
Go, go. Come on. Hey, Baron.
Jonathan!
Dad.
All those things I can do...
...all those powers...
...and I couldn't even save him.
Clark, get up.
Good morning, Smiley.
Clark, breakfast.
Are you going to sleep all day?
Clark, come on. Get up.
I have to leave.
I knew this time would come.
We both knew it from the day we found you.
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday.
He said that he'd be happy to help out from now on.
Mother!
I know, Son.
I know.
Do you know where you're headed?
North.
Remember us, Son.
Always remember us.
My son...
...you do not remember me.
I am Jor-El.
I am your father.
By now you will have reached your eighteenth year...
...as it is measured on Earth.
By that reckoning...
...I will have been dead for many thousands of your years.
The knowledge...
...that I have of matters, physical and historical...
...I have given you fully on your voyage to your new home.
These are important matters to be sure...
...but still matters of mere fact.
There are questions to be asked...
...and it is time for you to do so.
Here, in this...
...this fortress of solitude...
...we shall try to find the answers together.
So, my son...
...speak.
Who am I?
Your name is Kal-El.
You are the only survivor of the Planet Krypton.
Even though you were raised as a human, you are not one of them.
You have great powers, only some of which you have...
...as yet discovered.
Come with me now, my son...
...as we break through the bars of your earthly confinement.
Traveling through time and space.
Your powers will far exceed those of mortal men.
It is forbidden for you to interfere with human history.
Rather let your leadership stir others to.
In the next year, we shall examine the human heart.
It is more fragile than your own.
As we pass through the flaming turmoil which is the edge of your own galaxy...
...we will enter the realm of the red Krypton sun...
...source of your strength and nourishment...
...and cause of our eventual destruction.
The Planet Krypton, my son...
...your home as it was.
This year we shall examine the various concepts of immortality...
...and their basis in actual fact.
The total accumulation of all knowledge spanning the 28 known galaxies...
...is embedded in the crystals which I have sent along with you.
Study them well, my son.
By the time you return to the confines of your galaxy...
...twelve of your years will have passed.
For this reason, among others...
...I have chosen Earth for you.
It is now time for you to rejoin your new world...
...and to serve its collective humanity.
Live as one of them, Kal-El...
...and discover where your strength and your power are needed.
But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage.
They can be a great people, Kal-El, they wish to be.
They only lack the light to show the way.
For this reason, above all, their capacity for good...
...I have sent them you...
...my only son.
Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet.
Fresh fruit!
Hey, how about a tomato, lady?
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.
Smile.
How many "T's" in "bloodletting"?
Two.
What are you writing?
An ode to spring.
How do you spell "massacre"?
M- a-s-s-a-c-r-e.
Thanks.
Golly, how come you get all the great stories?
A good reporter doesn't get great stories.
A good reporter makes them great.
Chief, here's that story on the murder case.
The way I see it, it's a headline on the front page with my picture...
There's only one "P" in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.
Hello, Miss Lane, how are...
How are you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.
Hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.
It's got everything:
Sex, violence, the ethnic angle.
So does a lady wrestler with a foreign accent.
- Kent, can you open this?
- Sure, Mr. White.
This could be the basis for a series of articles:
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings" by Lois Lane.
We get psychologists, sociologists, interviews...
Lois, you're pushing a bunch of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.
The Daily Planet has a tradition...
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shake it up like that.
Of course not, Lois.
Why would any one want to make a total stranger look like a fool?
I'll take that.
Thanks. I'm sorry, Mr. White.
Why do I pay you $40 a week when
I should have you arrested for loitering?
- Go get Mr... a towel.
- Kent.
- Move, kid, move.
- Right, Chief.
- Make mine black, no sugar.
- Right, Chief.
And don't call me sugar.
Right... Sugar.
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I'll take tea with lemon.
Lois, why don't you take Kent out to meet everybody, huh?
Just introduce him around.
He's starting on the paper today.
I'm giving him the City beat.
Chief!
That's my beat!
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like just a mild-mannered reporter...
...but not only does he know how to treat his Chief with the proper respect...
...not only does he have a snappy, punchy prose style...
...but he is, in my 40 years in this business, the fastest typist I've ever seen.
That's great.
Here, you forgot my article.
Excuse me, Mr. White. I was wondering...
...if you could arrange for half my salary...
...to be sent to this address on a weekly basis.
Your bookie, right?
My what?
Don't tell me!
He sends a check every week to his sweet, gray-haired mother.
Actually, she's silver-haired.
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you very much, Mr. White.
Well?
Any more at home like you?
Not really, no.
I didn't think so.
Well, get yourself a desk over here.
Over here?
Here, there's some paper and a file right there.
Sorry.
- Hi, Bill Breesen.
- Hi, Clark Kent.
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome aboard.
- Here's your towel, Mr. Clark.
- Kent.
- What?
- Kent.
- Clark Kent.
- Jimmy Olsen.
- I met this really great guy, you know.
- Hey, fabulous.
We had this fabulous weekend.
I met him at this dude ranch.
I haven't been since I was seven.
- I got to mail these letters.
- Good luck tonight.
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois.
How did you like your first day on the job?
The hours were sort of longer than I expected...
...but on the whole, meeting you and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White...
Gosh, on a whole, I'd say it's been swell.
- "Swell"?
- Yup.
You know, Clark...
...there are very few people left in the world...
...who feel comfortable saying that word.
- What word?
- Swell.
Really? I always thought it was kind of natural.
- Sorry.
- Clark.
- Sorry, Lois.
- Hi, Rex.
- Did you see anything good today?
- Not until you came along.
Rex, this is...
- Clark Kent. How do...
- See you...
Lois?
Hey, where you going?
Can I help you with your coat?
- Thanks, can you get that?
- Sure.
Did you like Mr. White?
He was a nice guy and Jimmy was fantastic.
Come here. Come on.
Get in here, hurry up. Come on.
We'd better get out of here.
We'd better do what he says, Lois.
Come on, get in here, quick.
Don't, don't do anything.
It's all right, I'm coming.
We're coming.
Excuse me.
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.
Don't point that at me, sir.
You could hurt somebody with that.
Okay, okay. Hold it there.
Just a minute.
Now I realize that...
...times are tough for some these days, but this isn't the answer.
You can't solve society's problems with a gun.
You know, buddy, you're right.
- I'm going to turn over a new leaf.
- Good for you. That's the spirit.
He doesn't really want to hurt anyone.
Right after I rip off this lady's purse.
Of course!
Now come on, lady, hand it over.
Lois, I think you'd better...
Lois! What are you doing?
Are you all right?
What happened?
- Golly, I guess I must have fainted.
- Fainted?
- You fainted!
- I'm sorry.
Really, Lois, supposing that man had shot you?
Is it worth risking your life over $10...
...two credit cards, a hairbrush and a lipstick?
- How did you know that?
- Know what?
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Wild guess.
Taxi!
- Hey!
- Hi, Otis.
So, what's happening, partner?
Look what we got.
Let's take him.
Wait a minute.
Maybe he'll lead us to the big man himself.
Lex Luthor?
You got it, Aramus.
We'll make Captain by midnight.
Hey, what do you read?
XK-101 rocket to be used.
Hey, what do you read?
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi, Otis.
Just getting a Daily Planet here.
Okay. All right.
See, I'm paying him, and I got a pretzel, too.
Thanks, Otis.
How many bags, Shutzy?
This is Metropolis 46. We're on foot.
Over and out.
Let's go.
Your attention, please.
The Metropolis Flyer is now ready for departure...
...on the upper level. Track 6.
He's going down on a train platform.
I'm going after him.
Okay, I'll call for backup.
Be careful now, will you?
All right, Aramus. All right.
Now boarding on the lower level...
Now 10 minutes, air-conditioned cars,
Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie...
Board now. All aboard.
Metropolis Transportation to Buffalo, Syracuse...
Smoking cars are forward, move along now.
Luggage at the top.
Smoking cars are forward.
All aboard, boarding.
Aramus, Aramus, make it Track 22.
I've seen him and I'm right on him.
Lower level, Track 22.
So that's it!
It's amazing that brain can generate enough power to keep those legs moving.
Harry...
Harry, where are you? Harry?
Sick!
Sick, you're really sick!
I'm sick, Ms. Teschmacher?
Sick when we're days from executing the crime of the century?
No. Step away from that, please.
How do you choose to congratulate the greatest criminal mind of our time?
Do you tell me that I'm brilliant?
Oh, no, that would be too obvious,
I grant you.
Charismatic?
Fiendishly gifted?
Try twisted!
Get away from that, get away!
Tell me, Lex.
Why do so many people have to die for the crime of the century?
Why? You ask why?
Why does the phone always ring when you're in the bathtub?
Why is the most brilliantly diabolical leader of our time...
...surrounding himself with total nincompoops?
I'm back, Mr. Luthor.
I was just talking about you.
You were followed again.
In spite of those cat-like reflexes.
Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?
Yes.
Then why am I not reading it?
Because I haven't given it to you yet?
Right.
At last it's official.
Thanks to the help of the US Government...
...we are about to be involved in the greatest real-estate swindle of all time.
Lex, what is this...
...obsession with real estate?
All the time, "land, land, land."
When I was 6 years old, my father said to me...
"Get out! "
Before that, he said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall...
"... utilities and transportation systems may collapse...
"... people are no damn good, but they'll always need land...
"... they'll pay through the nose to get it."
- "Remember," my father said...
- "Land."
It's a pity that he didn't see...
...from such humble beginnings how I've created this empire.
An empire. This?
How many girls do you know have a Park Avenue address like this?
Park Avenue address, 200 feet below?
Do you realize what people are shelling out up there...
...for a few miserable rooms off a common elevator.
What more could anyone ask?
Get this Loch Ness update right into composing.
Yeah, no that's it, Roth.
Put it to bed, right.
Why are you standing here for?
I'm not.
- I wasn't going to say it.
- Go.
The sex maniac profile.
Right. Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize winner. What do you bet?
There's no "Z" in "brassiere."
Nice job on that union scandal, Kent.
Gosh, thanks, Mr. White.
Hi, Clark. Good night.
- Here, let me carry that for you.
- Thanks a lot.
Lois, have you got a minute?
Excuse me, please.
And these two go to the addresses on the envelope, okay?
I was wondering if you'd have dinner with me?
I'm sorry, I'm booked.
Air Force One is landing at the airport.
This kid'll be there to make sure...
...you-know-who answers the questions he would rather duck.
Don't you ever let up?
What for? I mean I've seen how the other half lives.
My sister, for instance.
Three kids, two cats, and one mortgage.
I would go bananas in a week.
- Can I take you to the airport?
- Not unless you can fly.
"Ladies." I have to change, thank you.
Goodbye.
Maybe we could...
- Would you mail that for me? Thanks.
- Sure.
Good night.
Going down, please, going down.
Going down?
Going up. Up, up.
Good night.
Daily Planet, Copter One. This is ground.
Planet One, go ahead.
Miss Lane is here for a ride to the airport to meet Air Force One. It's a hurry flight.
We're on our way over the river.
Have one aboard for transfer. Over.
Roger, Planet One. You're clear to land.
Wind 0-2-0-1-5. Altimeter 2-9-8-9.
Roger, Over and out.
A malfunction, can't get lift off.
- You've hooked a cable.
- What's happening?
Set it down.
My God, we've lost motor control.
I can't hold it.
I can't hold it.
He's lost it.
Wake up.
Help!
Step back, folks.
Get back. Move over to the other side of the street.
Bring the canvas here. Get it up there.
There's a helicopter up there.
Help me.
All right, folks. Let's move back.
Let these firemen get in here.
Help me!
Hold it. Get back.
Get off the street, folks.
All right, get along there.
Get away from the side of the building.
Hold these crowds back. Move.
Help!
Say, Jim...
Excuse me.
That's a bad outfit.
Okay, move these people.
My God! Look up there.
What the hell's that?
Easy, miss. I've got you.
You've got me? Who's got you?
I can't believe it, I just cannot believe it.
He got her.
Gentlemen, this man needs help.
I hope this little incident hasn't put you off flying, miss.
Statistically speaking, of course, it's still the safest way to travel.
Right.
Wait!
Who are you?
A friend.
'Bye.
Something wrong with the elevator?
Going down?
Officer.
Good evening, Officer Mooney.
They say confession is good for the soul.
I'd listen to this man. Take him away.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Move your ass! Come on!
Okay, let's go. Let's go.
Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons.
Bullshit! Come on, let's get out of here.
Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.
Okay, freeze, you turkeys.
- Don't shoot!
- Keep your cool. You got us.
Bad vibrations?
Sergeant, you don't believe me.
I swear it, flying.
With a big red cape and bright red boots as well.
Quick as a wink he was gone. He flew up in the air again, he did, like a big blue bird.
- A big blue bird?
- You don't believe me!
With bright red boots?
Take the night off.
Go back to Murphy's bar and continue what you started.
I'll be off in a few minutes and I'll meet you there.
The first bottle's on me.
Let me get my hat.
Frisky, will you come down from there.
Hi. I'll get him.
Come on, it's all right.
- Here you go, miss.
- Gee, thanks, mister.
Goodbye, Frisky. So long now.
'Bye.
Mommy, Mommy,
Frisky was stuck in the tree.
Then this man swooped out of the sky and gave him to me.
Haven't I told you to stop telling lies.
Metropolis Airport, this is Air Force One.
Could we have the latest weather report?
Metropolis currently ceiling 500, overcast 700 broken...
...visibility one half in showers.
Wind 2-4-0-2-5. Altimeter 9-0-9-8.
Roger.
Doesn't look good. What do you think?
- What the hell was that?
- You've lost power in number one.
Lost power? We've lost the whole engine.
- Pressure's going.
- Shut down number one.
Bring up two and three.
We haven't got enough pressure to keep going.
Mayday, mayday. Metropolis tower.
Air Force One.
We have lost port outboard engine and part of wing.
Request emergency landing.
What's the position?
Ten miles southwest of Metropolis Airport.
Notify them the President's on board.
Present position 10 miles, that's 10 miles southwest of Metropolis Airport.
Heading: 3-0-5, height: 6,000 feet.
What the hell happened?
We got our engine back?
What the hell's going on out there?
Fly, don't look, just fly.
We got something.
I'm not saying what it is, just trust me.
You enjoyed it.
I don't know what to say, Father.
I'm afraid I just got carried away.
- I anticipated this, my son.
- You couldn't have.
You couldn't have imagined...
How good it felt?
You are revealed to the world.
Very well.
So be it.
But you still must keep your secret identity.
Why?
The reasons are two.
First: You cannot serve humanity
28 hours a day.
As it is, in earth time.
Your help will be called for endlessly.
Even for those tasks that human beings can solve themselves.
It's their habit to abuse their resources in such a way.
And secondly?
Secondly:
Your enemies will discover...
...their only way to hurt you...
...by hurting the people you care for.
Thank you, Father.
Lastly:
Do not punish yourself with your feelings of vanity.
Simply learn to control them.
It is an affliction common to all, even on Krypton.
Our destruction could have been avoided but for the vanity of some...
...who considered us indestructible.
Were it not for vanity...
...at this very moment...
...I could embrace you in my arms...
...my son.
Reports are coming in of a miraculous saving of Air Force One...
...from almost certain destruction...
...rescuing Miss Lois Lane, reporter from the Daily Planet, with one hand...
...and a crashed helicopter with the other.
That'll be the day.
That'll be the day when a guy could fly.
I don't know. You would be surprised.
...some sort of fantastic hoax.
Your guess is as good as anybody's.
True or false?
Miracle or fraud? The answer...
- Miss Teschmacher!
- Man or myth?
Turn it off.
What's the story on this guy?
Do you think it's the genuine article?
If he is, he's not from this world.
Why?
If any human being was gonna perpetrate such a hoax, it would have been me!
My robe.
Right away, Mr. Luthor.
It all fits somehow, this coming here to Metropolis...
...and at this particular time.
There's a kind of cruel justice about it.
To commit the crime of the century, a man wants to face the challenge of the century.
Listen, maybe this guy that flies is just sort of passing through.
Passing through?
Not on your life, Otis...
...which I would gladly sacrifice by the way...
...for the opportunity of destroying everything that he represents.
And, Otis, by the way, next time put my robe on after I'm out of the pool.
Now look.
The Post, "It Flies."
The News, "Look, Ma, No Wires."
The Times,
"Blue Bomb Buzzes Metropolis."
The Planet. We're sitting on top of the story of the century here.
I want the name of this flying whatchamacallit...
...to go with the Daily Planet like bacon and eggs...
...franks and beans, death and taxes, politics and corruption.
I don't think that he'd...
...lend himself to any cheap promotion schemes.
Exactly how would you know that?
Just first impression.
Who's talking cheap?
I'll make him a partner if I have to.
- Right?
- Right, Chief.
I want the real story.
I want the inside dope on this guy.
Has he got a family? Where does he live?
What does the "S" stand for?
Tony, who is he? Mike, what's his name?
What's he got hidden under that cape?
Batteries?
Why did he show up last night?
Where does he come from?
Does he have a girlfriend?
What's his favorite ball team, Kent?
Now listen to me, I tell you, boys and girls...
...whichever one of you gets it out of him...
...is going to wind up with the single, most important interview since...
...God talked to Moses!
What are you standing around about for?
Move!
Get on that story.
"8:00," he said. Some friend!
That's the story of my life,
"Cinderella Bites The Dust! "
Good evening, Miss Lane.
Did you have plans this evening?
This old thing? No.
- I could come back later.
- No!
Don't move.
Sure you can move.
Just don't fly away, all right?
Sorry to drop in on you like this, but I've been thinking.
There must be some questions people'd like to know the answers to.
Yes.
You really shouldn't smoke.
Don't tell me. Lung cancer, right?
Well, not yet, thank goodness.
Would you like a glass of wine?
No, thanks. I never drink when I fly.
Nice place.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Shall we get started with the interview?
Let's start with your vital statistics.
Are you married?
No, I'm not.
Do you have a girlfriend?
No, I don't. But...
If I did, you'd be the first to know about it.
How old are you?
Over 21.
I get it. You don't want anyone to know.
And how big are you? How tall are you?
About 6' 4".
6' 4". And how much do you weigh?
Around 225.
I assume then that...
...the rest of your bodily functions are normal?
I beg your pardon?
Well, putting it delicately...
...do you...
...eat?
Yes, I do, when I'm hungry.
You do. Of course, you do.
Well, then is it true...
...that you can see through anything?
Yes, I can, pretty much.
And that you're totally impervious to pain?
Well, so far.
What color underwear am I wearing?
Did I embarrass you?
- No.
- I did.
No, it's just that this planter must be made of lead.
Yes, it is. So?
I sort of have a problem seeing through lead.
That's interesting.
Problems with lead.
- Do you have a first name?
- Like Ralph, or something?
- No, I mean like...
- Pink.
Pink!
Sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you.
You didn't embarrass me.
What's your background?
Where are you from?
It's kind of hard to explain, actually.
You see, I'm from...
Well, from pretty far away.
Another galaxy, as a matter of fact.
I come from a planet called Krypton.
Krypton.
Cripton! With a C-r-i...
No, actually it's Krypton, with a K-r-y-p-t-o-n.
Do you like pink?
I like pink very much.
Why are you?
Sorry?
I mean, why are you here?
There must be a reason for you to be here.
Yes, I'm here to fight for truth and justice and the American way.
You'll end up fighting every official in this country.
You don't really mean that.
- I don't believe this.
- Lois?
I never lie.
How fast do you fly, by the way?
I don't know. I've never actually bothered to time myself.
Say?
Why don't we find out?
And how do you propose we do that?
- Take a ride with me.
- You mean I could fly?
I'd be handling the flying, if that's okay.
- This is utterly fantastic.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?
- Are you serious?
- Sure.
Don't you want to go?
You won't need these.
- I need a sweater. It must be kind of...
- No, you'll be warm enough.
Ready?
Clark said that you were just a figment of somebody's imagination.
Like Peter Pan.
Clark, who's that? Your boyfriend?
- Clark? No, he's nothing.
- Peter Pan?
Peter Pan flew with children, Lois.
In a fairy tale.
Can you read my mind?
Do you know what it is that you do to me?
I don't know who you are.
Just a friend from another star.
Here I am, like a kid out of school.
Holding hands with a god.
I'm a fool.
Will you look at me?
Quivering.
Like a little girl shivering.
You can see right through me.
Can you read my mind?
Can you picture the things I'm thinking of?
Wondering why you are...
...all the wonderful things you are.
You can fly.
You belong in the sky.
You and I...
...could belong to each other.
If you need a friend...
...I'm the one to fly to.
If you need to be loved...
...here I am.
Read my mind.
We forgot to time ourselves.
Maybe next time.
You okay?
Good night.
Good night.
What a super man!
Superman!
Anybody home?
- Hi. Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah.
For goodness' sake, didn't you hear me knocking?
We did have a date tonight, remember?
You haven't been...?
I should certainly hope not.
Well, let's push off, shall we?
I'd better get a coat. It might be cold out.
I mean, I need a purse, and I have to fix my hair...
...put some blush on.
There's something I have to tell you.
I'm really...
I was at first really nervous about tonight.
But then I decided, darn it, I was going to show you the time of your life.
That's Clark nice.
We could go for a hamburger or whatever you want to do.
Now then...
...given the exact location of the galaxy that he mentions...
...and the proximity to our own solar system...
It's amazing. Amazing!
Too good to be true.
It's too good to be true.
6' 4", black hair, blue eyes...
...doesn't drink or smoke and tells the truth.
Some people can read War and Peace...
...and think it was an adventure story.
Others can read the ingredients on a gum wrapper...
...and unlock the secrets of the universe.
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do with the secrets of the universe?
Right, Miss Teschmacher.
"N."
"M"? You want "M," Mr. Luthor?
Coming right up.
So there you go, "M."
"M" as in "moron," Otis? No.
It's "N" as in "Neanderthal"...
..."nincompoop," "nitwit," and "L" as in "ladder."
Here's a ladder, coming right up.
I didn't see...
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.
In the interview he says that the Planet Krypton...
...exploded in 1948.
That ridiculous little freak...
...took three years in a rocket to get to earth.
- Ergo...
- Ergo.
Ergo 1948, that's three years on.
He's 6' 4", you know that?
Do you know why the number 200 is so vitally descriptive to both you and me?
It's your weight and my I.Q.
Think, people, think.
Deductive reasoning.
That's the name of the game.
Fragments from the Planet Krypton...
...exploded and went into outer space.
It is reasonable to assume...
...that some of those particles of debris drifted to Earth.
Meteorites!
Jawohl.
Voilà!
Voilà!
A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?
I know I'll get rapped in the mouth for this, but...
...so what?
So what? You mean to us they're just meteorites.
Fair enough.
But the level of specific radioactivity...
...is so high to anyone from the Planet Krypton...
...this substance is lethal.
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.
Fire and bullets can't hurt this guy...
...but this stuff here...
...will kill him.
Doesn't it give you a kind of...
...a shudder of electricity through you to be in the same room with me?
Not like the shudder you'll get when you lay that rock on him.
He can see you coming for miles with those super peepers of his.
O Lord, you gave them eyes, but they cannot see...
...nor can Superman, through lead.
He can't see through lead?
And Kryptonite will destroy him.
Any questions, class?
I wonder what they're wearing in Addis Ababa?
Looks like a burnoose.
It's just a wraparound.
Are we going to Addis Ababa, Mr. Luthor?
Mother Bird to Missile Convoy, over.
Missile Convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.
Everything looks good, see you at the base. Over and out.
Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.
Look at this!
Looks pretty bad.
Take her pulse.
Get an ambulance down here.
I don't want to hold this convoy up more than I have to.
She's having trouble breathing.
What do you think?
I suggest a vigorous chest massage.
If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.
Yes, sir!
I won't have my men do anything
I wouldn't be prepared to do myself.
Get an ambulance.
Gather around.
Turn around!
Hi.
Somebody hurt?
I did it, Mr. Luthor.
Miss Teschmacher, I did it.
- Just like you told me.
- All right, Otis.
It isn't that I don't trust you, but...
I don't trust you, Otis. What did you do?
I set the first directional vector...
...to 38.
The second one to 67.
And the third one to 117.
What about the fourth one?
What fourth one?
Wait a minute. The third one to 117?
- Yes. See, I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor.
- Otis!
The third one was supposed to be 11, and the fourth one, 7.
Oh, gee, Mr. Luthor.
I guess my arm wasn't long enough, see.
Would you like to see a long arm?
Otis, would you like to see a very, very, long arm?
No, Mr. Luthor.
- All right. Get it right.
- Yes, Mr. Luthor.
I thought you told me this road would be blocked off?
- Jablowsky, didn't I tell you...
- I didn't ask him, I asked you.
All right. Follow me, men.
Back that thing off the road.
Back it off the road.
You'll have to circle back.
I don't have time to argue.
It's a heck of a day, isn't it?
- Route 12? That's back there.
- No, sir, it's up there.
- Sergeant, we took the wrong road.
- I'm a Lieutenant. A Naval Officer.
Shut up! Now Route 12 is back that way.
This man is a diabetic, you see.
As you know, the Daily Planet is very interested in that dam...
...but what I don't understand...
...is why you'd sell out to a faceless person you've never met?
You don't know his name.
At the stupid high price he offered...
...for this worthless piece of desert...
...I hope it's Custer!
Perfect, just what I need. Thank you.
Reporting live from the launch site, ground zero.
Today marks a historic occasion since...
...two XK-101 rockets will be launched simultaneously.
One by the Army, and one by the Navy.
Hi, everybody.
Has anybody seen Lois today?
No, but the Chief wants to see you.
You're blocking the set, Clark.
Sorry, Gil. How's Judy today? Okay?
Good.
Excuse me, Mr. White.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Have you seen Lois today?
She's out West, looking into a land-fraud deal.
I sent young Olsen with her on his first assignment.
Some unidentified clown is buying thousands of acres...
...of worthless desert at incredible prices.
That doesn't seem to make sense.
The world doesn't make sense.
You ought to know that.
Look at this dispatch from Addis Ababa.
People break into a museum at night, kill two people, and what do they take?
A worthless piece of meteorite.
How do you figure that?
I've never been able to understand violence.
I know that about you.
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
I've been in this news game
40 years man and boy...
...and I got where I am with guts, compassion...
...elbow grease and something you're sadly lacking in, son.
Humility?
Not humility, you've got bags of humility.
Aggression, confidence, that's the ticket.
Take charge.
Let people know who you are.
This is Lex Luthor.
Only one thing alive with less than four legs can hear this frequency.
That's you.
In five minutes, a poisoned gas pellet containing propane lithium compound...
...will be released through thousands of air ducts in this city...
...effectively annihilating half the population of Metropolis.
I was a reporter before most of my friends were copy boys.
I want you to get Lois to introduce you to Superman.
Find out who he is.
Where did he get that blue suit?
Did he have it made?
Is it silk? Is it plastic?
I know it all seems a bit much...
...but how else was I going to meet you,
Superman?
I knew you'd never accept an invitation to tea.
But a disaster, with people in danger, people who need help...
I just knew you couldn't resist that chance to sort of pitch in.
You know what I mean?
There's a strong streak of good in you,
Superman.
But then nobody's perfect.
Almost nobody.
- Oh, Superman!
- Gee!
Stand back, please.
Nothing to get worried about.
Don't sit there like a numskull, get out!
Look at that overgrown boy scout,
Miss Teschmacher.
Tell me what you see?
Cuteness, dimples.
You like cuteness?
Dimples.
I'll give you dimples.
The pressure is still on you.
You know they say:
If you can't stand the heat...
...get out of the tunnel.
It's your last chance, Superman.
Why don't you do yourself a flavor and freeze.
I think he's coming, Mr. Luthor.
He's definitely coming.
It's open, come in.
My attorney will be in touch with you about the damage to the door.
Otis, take the gentleman's cape.
I don't think he wants me to.
Where's the gas pellet?
Somewhere.
It's in the back of my mind, actually.
It's a little idea I was toying with.
Is that how a warped brain like yours gets its kicks?
By planning the death of innocent people?
By causing the death of innocent people.
Fire!
Navy Bird, we have a good launch.
Navy missile...
As you may or may not know,
I am, as they say...
...very heavy into real estate.
To make money, you have to buy for a little and sell for a lot, right?
Right.
So, the problem?
How to make the land more valuable between the time you buy it...
...and the time you sell it?
Now this is California.
The richest, most populous state in the Union.
I don't need a geography lesson from you.
Of course, you've been there.
I do forget, you get around, don't you?
Where was I?
- California.
- California, right.
The San Andreas Fault, maybe you've heard of it?
Yes. It's the joining together of two land masses.
The fault line is shifting, which is why you get earthquakes in California.
Wonderful!
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Everything west of this line is the richest, most expensive real estate in the world.
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.
Everything on this side of the line...
...is just hundreds of miles of worthless desert land...
...which just happens to be owned by...
Lex Luthor Incorporated.
Now, call me foolish, call me irresponsible.
It occurs to me that a 500-megaton bomb...
...planted at just the proper point would...
Would destroy most of California.
Millions of people would be killed and the West Coast as we know it would...
Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.
Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast.
Costa Del Lex, Luthorville.
Marina Del Lex, Otisburg.
"Otisburg"?
Miss Teschmacher, she's got her own place.
"Otisburg"?
It's a little bitty place.
Otisburg?
I'll just wipe it off, that's all.
You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor.
A sick, twisted dreamer.
Your plan couldn't possibly work.
I'll admit there were a few problems.
Adjusting the precise trajectory of the missile.
Finding the optimum stress point for the fault line itself...
...which, by the way, is target zero.
Right...
...here.
That's impossible!
What's happening, Lieutenant?
Trajectory malfunction, sir.
Abort.
All counter control units...
...remove vacuum pressure to maximum.
Function negative, sir.
Can't you knock them down?
Absolutely impossible, sir. They have the new P-20 low-level avoidance systems.
Get me the Pentagon.
What do you think, super baby?
Interesting?
Your theory's quite impressive, Luthor.
Would you go to the viewing room, please?
But as for the rest, it's nothing but a sick fantasy.
Fantasy?
No.
It's history. It's happening, Superman.
Miss Teschmacher!
Yes, Lex?
Where's the rocket now?
It's going like a bat over the Grand Canyon, so is the other one.
The other one?
There are two of them?
Yes, Superman, double jeopardy.
Even you, with your great speed, couldn't stop both of them.
While I, on the other hand, could stop them with my detonator.
All right, Luthor, where is it?
Where's the detonator?
Diseased maniac!
Do you think you could hide it from me by encasing it in lead?
I'll mold this box into your prison bars.
Don't touch that.
I told you.
It's Kryptonite.
A little souvenir from your hometown.
I've spared no expense to make you feel at home.
You were great in your day.
But it just stands to reason...
...when it came time to cash in your chips...
...this old diseased maniac would be your banker.
Mind over muscle.
You don't even care where the other missile's headed, do you?
Certainly I do.
I know exactly where it's headed.
Hackensack, New Jersey.
I have to leave you now. No hard feelings.
We all have our little faults.
Mine's in California.
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.
Please, you can't...
...you can't just stand there.
You can't just stand and let millions of innocent people die.
Maybe.
Please, help me to save them.
Would you promise to save my mother first?
But, Lois, and Jimmy...
But my mother comes first.
If you promise, I'll believe you because you always tell the truth.
I promise, I promise.
Why did you kiss me first?
I didn't think you'd let me later.
Thank you, Miss Teschmacher.
Why is it I can't get it on with the good guys?
Stand aside now.
I wouldn't stay here, either.
Army Bird still heading due east.
Navy Bird still heading due west.
Losing radar contact.
Next radar contact after three seconds.
Army Bird still headed east, sir.
Army Bird gaining altitude.
Miss Teschmacher!
Radar contact strong.
Miss Teschmacher!
Radar report Navy Bird. San Andreas area.
Navy Bird heading down,
15 seconds to impact.
15 seconds and counting.
A military missile has exploded in the Southern California desert.
The force of the explosion has activated the San Andreas fault.
California is suffering a major earthquake.
What's going on?
It's a quake! Look!
Okay, kids, it's all right now.
Hey, it's Superman!
Holy mackerel!
We're going off the tracks.
All personnel evacuate dam.
Watch that cable!
Someone try and pull the main.
It's impossible. It's red hot!
Is that man all right?
Yeah.
Hang on, Jim.
The dam broke.
You're safe here, son.
That's okay. Miss Lane will be driving by any minute.
- Come on!
- Make it to the hill.
There has been major quake damage to Southern California.
The San Andreas fault has miraculously sealed itself.
Yet Southern California is suffering an aftershock of a major earthquake.
The population is still warned to be aware...
Please, come on, turn over.
Come on!
Help me. Help me, please.
It is forbidden for you to interfere...
There's one thing I do know, Son, and that is you are here for a reason.
It is forbidden.
All those things I can do.
All those powers...
...but I couldn't even save him.
It is forbidden.
Hi.
Don't bother, it's dead.
Sure it's dead.
The problem with men of steel is they're never around when you want one.
Do you know what happened while you were off flying around?
I was almost in an earthquake.
A gas station blew up beside my car.
Telephone poles falling all over the road.
I was almost killed.
To top the whole thing off, this stupid car runs out of gas.
I'm sorry about that, Lois.
But I've been kind of busy for a while.
I'm sorry, that's all right.
Thanks a lot, Superman.
Put me in the middle of nowhere during an earthquake.
No food, no water, snakes everywhere.
I had no idea if you were coming back.
There's something I have to do.
I'll see you later.
He can't stay still for a second.
Golly, Miss Lane, it's too bad
Mr. Kent wasn't here to see all this.
Yeah, poor Clark.
He's never around when...
Clark... Wait a minute.
What?
Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea.
I'll tell you something, Miss Lane.
I think he really cares about you.
- Clark? Of course, he does.
- No, not Clark.
Superman cares about everybody, Jimmy.
But who knows. Someday, if he's lucky...
You're messing up my suit!
Otis! Watch the ground, you...
Good evening, Warden.
These two men should be safe here
'til they can get a fair trial.
Who is it, Superman?
Lex Luthor.
- The greatest criminal mind of our time.
- Of our time.
- I hereby serve notice...
- He's serving notice to you.
...that these walls...
Will you shut up, you fat little fool!
You, you nitwit!
Nincompoop!
This country...
...is safe again, Superman, thanks to you.
No, sir.
Don't thank me, Warden.
We're all part of the same team.
Good night.

Huh?
[Knock At Door] Come in.
Party's ready to go, sir.
Oh!
What about the guest of honor?
Caruso went to tell him there's a fight in the galley.
That ought to bring him down.
Okay, Mac, he's coming.
Come on.
I said, vanilla!
I said, pistachio!
I said, vanilla!
Pistachio!
[All Shouting]
Knock it off! Hey!
What the hell do you men... think...
[Laughing] Oh, for Christ's sakes.
[Man Whistles]
- I'll have your ass for this, Caruso.
- I was only obeying orders, sir.
That's right, Dave. We just wanted you to know how we feel about you.
I gotta say, giving you this boat for your first command's... one of the few smart things that computer ever did.
You've been a good exec.
You'll make a hell of a skipper.
Hey, hey!
Let's hear it! Let's hear it!
This is, uh...
It's from all of us.
Nothing's gonna jump at me, is there?
Aw.
[Whistles]
Yeah!
All right!
[Blows Whistle]
I, uh... Well, for a fella who's never been at a loss for words,
I'd just like to say that, uh,
I'm at a loss for words.
I know just how to break this in though. Mm-hmm.
Monday I'll go pipe the new squadron commander into his swivel chair.
Oh, yeah.
Congratulations, Captain.

Bridge, aye.
Helm, Bridge.
Come right to course 3-1-5.
Captain to the bridge.
Just as a way of sort of wrapping this all up, I just wanna say...
[Man On Radio] Captain to the bridge.
 Gangway, Roberts. Move it!
Let's go ahead and get a fix, Larson.
 Aye, aye, sir.
Soundings, please?
Soundings, aye, sir.
Put the low pressure blower on all the main ballast tanks for 10 minutes.
[Blows Whistle]
Thanks, fellas.
What's up? Captain, we got a contact at 3-1-5 degrees,
3,000 yards on course 2-7-0.
That's a collision course with us.
I've come around to 3-1-5.
That ought to take us well astern of him.

Did we get off a radio signal?
We tried to, sir, but we may have been too far under.
Fathometer's reading a ledge or something.
[Captain] How deep? I can't tell, sir.
- We're sinking too fast.
- Thirteen hundred feet!
- We're going to hit it.
- We're gonna bottom out.
Grab something and hold on.
[Shouting]
Oh, Jesus!
[Groaning]
She's holding.
She's holding!
[Groaning Continues]
Are we gonna crush, sir?
I guess not.
[Sighs]
Fourteen hundred and fifty feet!
[Men Groaning]
They really built this baby.
Thank God.
God and General Dynamics.
High pressure air system holding?
Air holding, sir.
Have Engineering check it, and put a watch on it.
Yes, sir. I gotta find out how bad we're hurt.
Sir!
Get him up forward.
Visual check on that, chief.
Aye, aye, sir.
[Groaning Continues]
Get Doc in here.
He was... He was aft, sir, along with Kelly, Frazier and...
All right.
Get Page then. Anybody.
We got people hurt in here.
Aye, aye, sir.
This is the captain.
We're bottomed out on a shelf here... at 1,450 feet.
Looks like we're hurt pretty bad, but our hull is holding.
[Over Radio] The reactor's shut down.
Our engine spaces may be flooded,
but we have battery power
for most systems, including air.
Whoever hit us must have radioed, so by this time,
Norfolk has to know what's happened.
Help's probably already on the way.
So, what we do is, uh, sit tight till they get that rescue vehicle down on us,
then we all take an elevator ride.
That's all for now.
- Dave, I thought...
- Congratulations, skipper.
Identify her, Jim?
Looks like the Neptune.
She was the only sub in that area. What's the closest thing you've got to her?
An L.S.T., Nassau.
She's about 50 miles east of the collision point.
Well, move her in there.
Aye, aye, sir.
[Clicking]
[Phone Ringing]
[Woman] Hello? [Electric Shaver Whirring]
What?
Oh, just a minute.
Michael!
- Barnes.
- Sir, this is Cinclant fleet duty officer.
At 0532, a Norwegian freighter... rammed a sub 60 miles east of New London.
The sub which sank following collision... believed to be Neptune.
[Ringing]
- Yeah, Bennett.
- I need you on the double. Gray lady down.
One of yours.
Ten minutes.
List of the missing, sir.
Good God!
Fifty-two. It's more than...
I can read.
Sorry, sir.
[Groaning] Easy, easy. Easy.
You're bleeding.
[Chattering]
Captain, report on the damage.
All right, chief.
Let's just see what we got up forward first.
I've, uh, put Page in charge, sir. Fine.
He's the closest we've got to a medic.
We're lucky to have him.
Thank you, sir.
Phil, how are you feeling?
Pretty good, sir.
Yeah, that's a professional job.
Nothing to that.
Do you have any idea who hit us, Captain?
No, not a clue.
I'd sure like to break his ass.
I'll hold your coat.
Let's have a look at your patients.
Up this way.
Collins.
I've got most of the serious injuries up here.
Well, you think you can handle it all right?
Well, sir, I can handle the stitching, and I can handle the broken bones.
But we got three head wounds up here, and Richards is no good at all.
That ice pack's about all I can do for him.
How bad is he?
I can't tell without X-rays.
These men need to get to a hospital, but fast.
Do the best you can.
We really need you.
Yes, sir. Captain?
Uh, some of the men have asked for tranquilizers.
Just don't get my crew stoned on me, huh?
[Chuckles] Yes, sir.
Oh, chief, let's have it, huh? Here, sir.
We took it real hard in the stern.
It split right through.
All compartments were flooded.
But the bulkheads are holding this far down.
Don't ask me how.
Most of our air system is still intact too.
Most of it?
One of our purifiers is out, sir.
Forty-one men exhale a lot of carbon dioxide.
We'll be okay for maybe a day and a half.
We won't be down here that long.
Where's the storekeeper?
Hanson?
Here, sir.
How are we fixed for food?
We got plenty of food.
We got 100 chicken fricassees,
300 lime Jell-O...
I didn't ask for a menu.
No, sir.
Just give the men whatever they want whenever they want it, huh?
Yes, sir.
Okay, fellas. Coming through.
We have to assume they're somewhere in the area of that channel. Right, sir.
Or, if they've landed
in the canyon, it's all over.
If they've landed in the neck of it...
Can we get them out?
Maybe, sir.
What do you mean, Ben?
Have a look at this.
It so happens I'm fairly familiar with the area.
We've done sonar testing here.
Sinking old cars and tracking them all the way to the bottom.
Thank you. Ah.
Here's the neck of the canyon.
As you see, it's shaped like a trench.
Hopefully Neptune is located somewhere in this area.
But, Admiral, notice the slope of that trench.
It's nearly vertical.
Which causes gravity slides.
They're frequent, and they're very severe.
Even if she has bottomed out in this area, one large slide, and it's a two-mile ride to the bottom.
When will Nassau arrive there?
Not for a couple of hours, Admiral.
I want you to take charge of search and rescue, Ben.
We've got an aircraft waiting for you.
A D.S.R.V. will be flown to New London.
Should meet you about mid-afternoon.
Hopefully by then you will have established some kind of contact.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Your car is at the entrance, sir.
I'll be right there.
Yes, sir.
[Dialing Phone]
[Phone Ringing]
- Hello.
- Liz, it's Neptune.
Is Paul all right? I don't know.
I'm on my way there now myself.
Listen, do me a favor, will you?
Tell Vickie Blanchard yourself before they officially...
- Of course.
- And, Liz, tell her... whatever it takes, we'll get him out of there.
[Man On P.A.]
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
This is an emergency.
All Deep Submergence

Sir, number two air purifier non-fixable, sir!
Get lost, Caruso.
"I'll fix it in one shot," I told him.
Any station, this is Neptune.

- Yeah, right.
Keep calling, Harris.
Any station.
Any station, this is Neptune. Over. Sir?
Recheck the hatches, chief.
Aye, aye, sir.
Where's Page?
Up there, sir.
What's up, Page?
It's Richards, sir.
I think he might go, sir.
You want me to move him?
Away from the others, I mean?
No.
What do you want me to do if he goes?
Cover him up.
?? [Flute]
Fowler's covering the control room, sir.
Yeah, I know that.
Where'd you learn to play the flute like that?
At home, sir.
Not easy to find a flute teacher in Nashville.
[Chuckles] They're pretty big on guitars down there, I guess.
Yeah. Do you think, uh, we'll ever get home again, sir?
- Hell, yes.
- My folks...
I'm, like, their, uh, fair-haired wonder.
Annapolis and all.
They're plain people.
They're just, um, very proud of me, sir.
Well, they're not gonna lose you, Danny.
Anything yet, Harris?
Nothing yet, sir.
Keep trying.
[Knock On Door] Come.
We're still tight, sir.
Uh, found this, sir.
Give me about five minutes, then ask him to come in here, will you?
Yes, sir.
Hey!
He's down, isn't he?
Any station, any station, this is Neptune. Over.
Oh, Dave.
It goes with a ship and a crew.
Yeah, so they tell me.
All yours, skipper.
Oh, wait a minute!
- We didn't have to surface.
- Dave...
But you just wanted
to ride into port up there.
Everybody look. Captain Friendly on the bridge for the last time.
[Chuckles]
- It's the last time, all right.
- Now, look.
You can either take a couple of aspirin and quit the bullshit or get yourself into sick bay.
I don't want any more...
[Rumbling]
Jesus Christ.
Any station, any station, this is Neptune.
Any station, any station,

What is it, Captain?
[Rumbling Stops]
Gravity slide.
Check for damage.
Aye, aye, sir. Any station, any station, this is Neptune. Over.
Report all damage to the control room.
Where's the chief?
He's gone forward, sir.
I'll get him.
Answer me, goddamn it!
Why aren't any of you here?
Why aren't they here?
They don't fool me, man!
I know they can hear me!
Harris.
Why don't they hear? Why don't they hear me? Harris.
Let's get him forward into a bunk.
They're not fooling me.
Come on. They're not deaf. They're not deaf!
Take it easy.
Oh, wait.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Don't relieve me, sir. Don't relieve me.
It's okay.
I can watch... I can stand my watch.
[Grunts]
Better put someone on this. Right?
- Peña.
- Aye, sir.
Any station, any station, this is Neptune.
This is Neptune. Over.
Any station, any station, this is Neptune.
This is Neptune. Over.
Any station, this is Neptune.
Any station, this is Neptune. Over.
That's between us and the ocean.
The pressure on it must be unbelievable.
Six hundred pounds per square inch.
About 4,000 tons.
Built-in safety factor or not, we're pushing our luck in here.
Look at that.
It could give way anytime, sir.
Shouldn't we... evacuate the control room, sir?
We can't.
We need it, Danny.
[Man On Radio, Indistinct]
Captain. Station callingNeptune, say again.
You're very garbled and barely readable. Over.
What have you got?
Contact with a surface ship, sir.
The signal is very garbled, and I didn't get most of it, but I did hear "Neptune."
Stay on it.
This is Neptune.
This is Neptune. Over.

Are we ever glad to hear you.
Hello, Tom. Good morning, Captain.
Welcome to Nassau.
We have voice contact with Neptune.
 Very well.
Lieutenant Phillips.
Sir.
Notify Admiral Barnes in Norfolk immediately, and find out the current status of the D.S.R.V.
Phillips, get me the latest weather picture.
Then report to the operations center.
Aye, aye, sir.
Captain Blanchard standing by, sir.
Thank you.
Hello, Captain.
Hal Bennett here. Over.
[Blanchard On Radio] Glad to know it's you up there, Ben. Over.
What's your exact situation, Paul?
All compartments aft of the control room appear to be flooded.
The bulkhead's holding.
The reactor's shut down.
We're on battery power with 90% capacity.
We have adequate air for 36 hours.
Forty-one men accounted for.
Several casualties, some critical. Over.
What is your exact angle and depth? Over.
We're at 1-4-5-0 feet,
down nine degrees by the stern...
with a 10-degree starboard list.
Over.
Roger. Paul, we have an approximate fix on your location.
A D.S.R.V. is en route.
Estimated time of arrival: 1400.
Over.
See, I told you. Didn't I tell you?
Shut up! Shut up!
We'll be home for dinner!
Shh!
- How's your crew holding up, Captain?
- Just fine, sir.
I think we'd all like to get word to our families.
I understand. Have one of your men prepare a list of survivors.
I'll take care of it right away.
Over.
Roger. Out.
Now you can let it out.
[All Exclaiming]
Everybody out of the control room except necessary personnel.
The X. O?
Here.
Aye, sir.
All personnel not actually on watch, leave the control room.
All right, fellas.
Everybody out.
[Creaking]
Phillips?
Sir.
Do you see any problems with the D.S.R.V. here?
None so far, sir.
Right.
Bloome, any problems?
Sir.
No, sir. We can operate on any angle up to 50 degrees.
Fortunately, the Neptune is only listing 10 degrees, so we can attach without any problems, sir.
This matches up with the sub's forward escape hatch.
Sea pressure will keep us seated on her, allowing the hatches of both vessels to be opened...
Bloome, I don't need the whole lecture.
Yes, sir.
What about the currents, Phillips?
If this is the location of the sub, we have a fairly strong current in that channel.
One to three knots.
Weather forecast?
Uh, clearing, sir.
Seas, three to five feet.
Uh-huh. Oh.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I don't know if he's very smart or very dumb.
I think he's gone under the boat.
Hey, put your gloves on...
[No Audible Dialogue]
Hey!
[Men Groaning, Shouting]
- No sound!
- Hey, there's no sound out here!
? ? [Humming Theme From Jaws] Come on!
Can't hear!
?? [Humming Continues]
Ohh, look at that!
Here he comes.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[British Accent] I'll catch that mother, or my name ain't...
[Man, High-Pitched Voice]
Oh, stop being so aggressive.
[Men Laughing]
Hey, I think I'm gonna throw up.
[Laughing Continues]
Uh, did somebody ring
the dinner bell up here?
[Laughing] [Rumbling]
Hey, what's going on? What is it? Hey!
What's going on in here?
[Men Chattering]
[Chattering Continues]
Secure all watertight doors.
Secure all watertight doors.
Secure all watertight doors.
Secure the...
Hey, that door!
Dave, flood the ballast tanks.
That might settle us.
Flooding the ballast tanks.
[Rumbling Stops]
[Men Groaning, Chattering] Give me a hand.
Sit him up.
[Groaning Continues]
Bring him on in.
Slow down.
Easy, easy.
Okay. Watch it, watch it, watch it.
Nassau. Nassau, are you still reading us? Over.
Roger.
We've had a gravity slide here.
A severe gravity slide.
Get Captain Bennett on the horn.
[Groaning Continues]
That's it.
Hello, Neptune. This is Captain Bennett.
Do you read me? Over.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. We must have had an avalanche down here.
- I don't know what's on top of us.
- Paul, listen to me carefully.
We've got to know how much of your hull is covered, particularly the escape hatch.
Make a manual test.
Repeat, manual test. Over.
Roger. Out.
[Page] Let me have a big bandage out of that case.
Cover him up good.
Here's a bandage.
If that hatch is covered up, sir...
Keep your fingers crossed.
[Tapping]
[Tapping Continues]
[Sighs]
Captain Bennett.
Thank you.
[Blanchard On Radio] Ben, we're socked in.
Manual test confirms it.
The escape hatch
seems to be completely buried.
Mud, rocks, God knows what.
Over.
Situation understood, Paul.
Informing Norfolk immediately.
Paul, I promise you, we will find a way to clear that hatch.
Roger. Out.
[Chuckling]
Oh, yes.
They will find a way.
Bill.
Michael.
Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Lieutenant.
Admiral Williams.
Captain.
Excuse me.
They're all here, Mr. Secretary.
Fine. Gentlemen, will you come in, please?
Mr. Secretary, Admiral Barnes. Hello, Admiral.
It's good to see you.
How are you? Captain Skinner.
Captain Skinner.
I wouldn't have called you away,
Admiral, but I feel it's imperative... that we all be briefed on this.
Yes.
Please, please, sit down.
I understand the ship is resting now below its crush depth.
Yes, sir, it is, but the hull seems to be holding.
How much deeper can she go and still survive?
Who can say? A few hundred feet might finish her.
If that happens, what are the chances of a nuclear accident?
Crushing will not cause a nuclear accident, sir.
There'll be no radioactive seepage.
The system design will not allow that to happen, sir.
Thank you, gentlemen.
How much time do we have?
Maybe 30 hours.
If nothing changes.
What do we have that will clear that hatch, Bill?
We have a small submersible...
It's a little bug, but it might just do the job.
It was developed on a shoestring budget.
The man that designed it claims it'll do most anything.
It has an arm, and I believe it's television-equipped, isn't it?
Yes, I think so.
It's supposed to do a lot of things, and clearing the earth off an escape hatch could certainly be one of them.
Let me emphasize, sir, it's still experimental.
It's called the... the Snark?
- Can we get it?
- Absolutely.
That is, if the secretary will authorize it.
I think Don Gates should go along with it.
He's the young captain who's developed it.
All right.
I'll authorize it.
[Horn Blaring]
[Horn Honking]
Captain Gates!
Captain Gates!
Hey, sir!
You got a call from the office of the Secretary of the Navy.
Hello!
A sub is down.
They wanna use the Snark.
Hey, partner, how's that arm?
Doing better, sir.
How you feeling? Fine?
Captain?
Harris.
How you doin'?
I, uh, don't know what happened up there.
You just did what we all felt like doing.
Yes, sir.
Take it easy.
Hey, how are you?
How you doin'?
Captain, can I speak to you a moment, sir?
What's up?
Is that, uh, whatchamacallit here yet?
Not yet.
It should be along anytime.
Lieutenant Fowler's gonna help you figure out a procedure... to get these people through here to the escape hatch.
You think it can dig us out, sir?
Captain Bennett thinks so.
Do you think so, sir?
Yeah, I do.
Have Lieutenant Bloome report to me on the helo-deck immediately. Aye, aye, sir.
Captain Gates? Hal Bennett.
Welcome aboard.
Don Gates.
Just secure her for now.
We'll dive in 20 minutes.
Can you show me to the com shack?
Aye, aye, sir.
Right this way.
Mickey? Everything working okay? Sir.
Yeah. You wanna, uh, set this up?
Certainly. Excuse me.
Oh, uh, these... will have to go.
Here, take these.
Okay.
We don't have power yet.
What I need is 110, AC.
Do you need this cable?
Yeah. Right over there, chief.
TV monitor, talk back.
This'll be able to see everything the Snark can see.
Get this set up, and before you know it,
you and me will be down at the bottom of the sea with that submarine.
You betcha. [Bennett] Captain Gates.
Captain Gates?
I think we'll operate more efficiently if we bear in mind who's in charge here.
Yes, sir.
The Snark is a two-man vehicle.
Is that correct?
Yes. I work it with Mickey here.
This is Lieutenant Bloome, Gates.
- You'll be working with him today.
- What?
Have a good look at the controls in that thing before you go down.
Aye, aye, sir.
Just a minute.
Captain Gates, Lieutenant Bloome is a submersibles expert.
- He's one of my team here.
- This is a unique vehicle.
There are no experts.
There's me and Mickey.
He planned it with me, built it for me.
Sir, you see...
Look, this is not a town meeting.
I said you will take Bloome.
He knows these waters.
When will you be ready to dive?
We'll dive in 45 minutes.
Bloome.
Sir, would, uh...
Excuse us, gentlemen.
Okay, Bloome.
Now, you're down here
on your belly like this.
To operate the nose camera and the light, they're both in sync, so wherever you point the light, the camera goes there too.
- How about the mechanical arm?
- It works just like a crane.
Uh-huh.
Pull it back to retract it.
See the stick?
Mm-hmm.
Side to side.
Nothing hard about it.
How in the hell do you stay so calm?
You know, I had this funny flash when we were bottoming out, sir, that, uh, I didn't give a damn one way or the other.
Hit me just the opposite.
Hit me just how much
I wanted to stay around, especially with this boat and this crew.
Only yesterday I was thinking, it's all over, isn't it?
All set, Captain?
All set.
Lieutenant, you understand this contraption?
Yes, sir. It's not all that different from our own R.V.-1.
Just remember, any problems, you notify us immediately.
Two dead heroes won't help anyone.
Listen, don't try to take off too much in one bite.
Let's hit it.
Good luck.
Bye.
Snark, do you read me? Over.
Snark, do you read me? Over.
Snark, do you read me? Over.
Of course I do.
Have you got it?
Yes, sir.
No problems so far.
Two hundred feet. [Bennett On Radio] Roger.
[Gates On Radio]
Two hundred and fifty feet.
Two ninety-five.
Three hundred and forty feet.
Water temperature, 48 degrees.
Passing 400 feet.
Looks good, Mickey.
What's his angle of descent?
Snark, what is your angle of descent? Over.
[Gates] Ten degrees, increasing one degree every 150 feet.
[Rattling]
Uh, 525 feet.
Uh, there's a little vibration.
Nothing to worry about, Bloome.
[Chuckles]
Coming up on 600 feet.
That shouldn't bring him down very far off, sir.
Not too fast.
Go on your sonar now.
Passing 1,000 feet.
Go on.
We're turning on the cameras and going on sonar.
[Beeping Slowly]
[Beeping Continues]
[Bloome] There she is.
We have a sonar contact.
[Rumbling]
Do you read us up top?
We're taking a little beating down here.
Current layer, sir. We're expecting...
That's okay. Yeah, it's fine.
Look, sir, as long as it doesn't go too heavy, you know?
Gates, this is Bennett.
Hold on till you get beneath that layer.
[Chuckling] Okay, Captain.
We're gonna hold on.
Uh-oh.
We've lost contact.
That layer must be deflecting your sonar.
Decrease your rate of descent.
You'll have to make contact visually.
Coming up on 1300 feet.
Seems to be settling down.
Neptune, are you getting all this?
We hear it.
Just take a little longer, that's all, Paul.
 We'll be here.
You heard the man.
Relax.
[Sighs]
Relax. Yes, sir.
Are you relaxed?
Yeah, I'm... We're relaxed.
I'm relaxed.
We are relaxed.
Coming up on 1400 feet.
[Beeping Intensifies]
And my sonar is saturated with reverberations.
Captain, there it is!
Down a little.
Wait a second.
I think I see it.
Damn, it's hard to see.
Damn light reflections!
There. That must be it.
Hard to starboard.
Do you see her?
[Gates] Yeah, Bloome thinks so.
We're moving in for a closer look.
We can't be this far off.
Easy.
In a little closer.
Little closer.
There. I do see it.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Sorry, Paul.
What we thought was you turned out to be an old sonar target.
[Gates]
Captain Bennett, I'm taking it back up.
[Bennett] How far? All the way.
[Bennett] We'll try again, Paul.
Roger.
Captain Gates?
What happened?
Why did you stop looking for her?
I gotta have my own man down there.
And you thought that's sufficient reason to abandon the search?
When I'm steered to a '52 De Soto, yes, sir.
It's not your fault.
You'd really get the hang of it... after a week of lyin' on your belly lookin' through those little peepholes.
But we haven't got a damn week!
We haven't got time for this either, Gates. I'm sorry.
You have dived nowhere but Nantucket Sound in that...
Contraption.
No, sir.
Captain, Lieutenant Bloome is an expert in these waters.
He knows the currents, he knows the rock formations.
I don't mean to argue, but, please, we can dig those guys out.
Gates, how can you be sure... that this man is even physically fit for the job?
Mickey, show him your muscles or somethin', will ya?
I really can handle it, sir.
No kidding.
[Man On P.A.]
Sir, Pigeon and D.S.R.V. approaching.
Lieutenant Phillips,
advise Neptune she's here.
Aye, aye, sir.
There's our rescue vehicle, Gates.
We don't wanna keep her waiting, so get back in your machine and do what you were sent here to do.
- Can I take my chief with me?
- Take Little Orphan Annie if you need to.
Sir, we've lost communication with Neptune.
Can you fix it?
I don't know.
I'm gonna have to get behind this control panel.
Oh, goddamn it.
What are we gonna do, sir?
Even if they do get to the hatch now, how are we gonna know when...
How do I know?
All I know is I'm beginning to feel like a one-legged man... in an ass-kicking contest.
Are you supposed to be here?
Well, uh...
Lieutenant, you on watch?
No, I'm not on watch.
Then get out!
Yes, sir.
What'd you call me?
"Captain Friendly"?
Look, Paul, whatever I said back there...
Let it go.
- Mickey!
- Coming, sir!
I want those back shined.
Let's go.
[Chuckles]
Cables are free, sir.
How deep was that current layer?
Eleven hundred feet.
Only lasted for a couple of hundred, but it sure scared the hell out of me.
Well, at least this time we know it's comin'.
[Bennett On Radio] Snark, this is Bennett.
Do you read me? Over.
Roger, Mother Hen.
This is Baby Chick.
I roger your transmission.
How me?
Oh, give me a shot, will ya?
Sorry, buddy.
There's none left.
[Groaning]
Hey, Jackson.
Hey.
Hey, why don't you hold this for me? Sure.
Thanks.
What would you have done?
What?
Well, if you were on the bridge and you had radar contact on a collision course...
Danny... I said notify me at 3,000 yards.
Danny, what are you talkin' about?
Well, I can't help thinking...
What-Whatever it is, forget it.
Yes, I know...
Forget it, okay?
Yeah. Sure.
Here, give me a hand.
There you go.
Feels like we're coming down on the layer.
I'm gonna try to drop it through faster this time.
Okay.
Whew.
[Chuckles]
Slowing. Slowing.
Very nice.
Get on the camera.
All right.
Sonar. Camera.
Have you got anything on your monitor?
[Bennett On Radio] Nothing yet.
Do you have sonar contact?
Sonar contact?
We got nothin' but sonar contact.
Reverberations off these mountains down here.
We don't have a reading on that, chief.
Why, you no-good, rotten, complicated son of a...
All right, that's not gonna help.
I'll be damned if I know what's wrong with it, sir.
Get the wiring diagram.
Right, sir.
Yeah, and a nine-pound sledgehammer.
I know how you feel, chief.
Huh?
Yeah. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Complicated...
Come right about 10 degrees.
A little more.
Bennett, do you see her?
We've found her.
[Gates] Do you see her?
All right. Yes, we do, Gates.
Congratulations.
Jesus Christ!
Are you picking this up?
It's a miracle anybody's alive in there.
Try them again.
Neptune, do you read?
Neptune, do you read?
Over.
Neptune, do you read?
Neptune, do you read? Over.
We'll attempt to make contact.
[Banging]
Sounds like somebody locked in the head.
[Banging Continues]
That came from outside.
They're on the deck.
[Tapping Morse Code] Shh!
"Will clear escape hatch for D.S.R.V."
How about that?
I hope they understood it.
If I did, they did.
Okay, I'm gonna lift her off now.
Okay.
And no physical movement unless it's absolutely essential.
We do have reserve air in the high pressure system, but we've gotta conserve it.
We don't know how long this is gonna take 'em.
I think they're using chopsticks up there.
Why don't you belay that, chief?
Well, it's good occupational therapy.
[Rumbling]
We're gettin' low on juice.
We need a recharge.
Go on auxiliary.
Listen, if we do that, we're all...
Just do it.
We can't go up now.
We'll be finished in half an hour.
Finished is the word, boy.
Pigeon Control, do you read me?
This is Captain Bennett. Over.
[Man On Radio]
Have you loud and clear. Over.
The second I say "go," we want D.S.R.V. underway. Is that understood? Over.
This is Pigeon. Roger.
We'll be ready. Out.
Come on. Come on.
I'm just checking this power supply.
Just keep goin'.
[Sighs]
[Rumbling] Earth slide!
Bennett, earth slide!
Pull her back!
It's getting worse. [Bennett] We're reading it here. Bring it up!
No. We've gotta see what happens to the sub.
[Men Shouting]
Captain!
Captain, we're goin' over!
[Chattering, Groaning]
Holy Christ!
Look how we're lyin'.
[Murphy] They'll never get to us now!
 Fowler, check for damages aft.
How much more can we take?
I said check for damage, mister!
Aye, aye, sir.
Murphy!
Get a detail to help up here.
If there's any people hurt back there, move 'em forward. Aye, aye, sir.
Come left a little.
That's it. Steady up.
[Gates] Are you getting this?
Yes. At that angle, the D.S.R.V. can't hook up to her, even if they're still alive.
I'll go and find out. [Bennett] Roger.
Have we got anything left here, Dave?
Not much, sir.
Captain.
Page got 'em all on mattresses, sir.
That's all he can do.
All right.
What else?
I don't know.
I will be damned if I know what else.
If we could just... apply some high school physics here.
If we could... shift our balance, then we'd come up right, or at least upright enough... to get at that escape hatch.
Our ballast tanks are above us and below us now, right?
Both of 'em full of water.
Right.
We can still reach the emergency bypass valves.
We could... blow the starboard tanks.
That'd let the weight of the water in the port tanks roll us over.
It's worth a try.
I like it.
What if we can't control how far we roll?
And when we blow the tanks, we blow our reserve air.
That's right. And we don't know if it would even work.
It's pure theory.
We don't have many options.
Any.
[Pounding]
[Chuckles] The Avon lady.
We gotta signal 'em what we're gonna do.
McAllister, bring that wrench.
Yes, sir.
[Tapping Morse Code]
[Tapping Stops]
Jesus H. Christ.
Okay, here it is.
It's not too good.
They're down to 37 men now.
The hull and the bulkheads
are still holding.
Their angle is precisely 70 degrees.
7-0.
Roger.
Hey, there's more.
Blanchard thinks that if he blows his starboard tanks,
the boat may right itself enough so that...
the D.S.R.V. can mate up
with the escape hatch.
Only thing is, he's not sure
whether the tanks are ruptured or not.
Also, he has to use
all his reserve air to blow them.
Over.
Roger. Bring the Snark up.
Sir, we'd just as soon stay down here with them.
[Bennett] That won't be necessary, Gates.
Sir, we've seen it through this far.
I really think we should stay with it.
We'll come up to 1300 feet, okay?
Gates?
Gates?
Gates?
What's all this "we" stuff?
I don't wanna hurt your image.
Think it'll take it?
[Sighs]
Let's go. I don't want anybody else in there when I open those valves.
Come on. Everybody out.
Commander.
Come on!
- I'll do it!
- Murphy!
Dave, get out!
Danny, get outta there!
I can't!
I gotta hold these open!
Come on!
Clear out, Paul!
It's too heavy!
You'll never close it from that side!
Help me, you son of a bitch!
Come on, Paul!
[Chattering, Shouting]
[Bennett] Gates, is it working?
Yeah. Yeah, it's turning.
It stopped!
Damn it!
Do you see that, Bennett?
That rock's stopping her.
Yes. She's caught there.
That angle doesn't look good.
No less than 60 degrees.
It won't work.
We're coming up.
What the hell happened?
It's all right.
We-We-We just stopped.
I don't understand right now.
Something's holding us back.
Well, what is it, Captain?
Take it easy.
Sir, what happened back there, sir?
Captain, what happened back there? Captain?
How much air do you calculate they've got left?
No more than 10 to 12 hours, sir.
Gates?
That mechanical arm on the Snark...
it's fairly versatile, isn't it?
Can it handle explosives?
Handle?
Carry them? Place them?
I guess so.
I was thinking, if we could blast away just a section of that rock, there'd be no more obstruction.
The sub would roll upright, and the hatch would be cleared.
Captain, your explosion would cave in the whole submarine.
There would be no one left to rescue.
Not if we use shaped charges.
You see, the blast from a shaped charge... goes only in one direction.
We could rig it so that it would blow away from the submarine.
- We have no demolitions team.
- We can get one.
Sir... Don't touch it, chief. It's live.
Okay, Captain.
What you wanna do is very dangerous.
I mean, we're takin' a live charge down that's all ready to blow, and it can damn sure go off when we place it.
Will it be ready soon?
Yes, sir.
But, listen, if it's not placed just right, we're gonna put one hell of a hole in that sub.
Well, then, we'll have to place it just right, won't we, Lieutenant?
I'm with you, sir, but I'm here to tell you... it's kind of tricky when you got earth slides and currents.
You're using a mechanical arm.
Lieutenant, I know you can do it.
After you.
Yes, sir.
Three's a crowd, huh?
Watch it on television, Mickey.
Everything set? Gates, the men have gotta know what's happening down there before the blast.
Can you signal them?
They're not gonna believe it.
I'm not sure I do myself.
Hey!
What the hell's that?
What's goin' on? Hey, the batteries...
It's the batteries.
Hey, come on! Put the lights on!
[Voices Overlapping]
All right, fellas, knock it off.
Light the battle lanterns.
Light the battle lanterns.
Here, Danny, hold this.
Comin' through, fellas.
Watch your head, sir.
[Man] You're on my feet. Well, it...
There we go.
All right, hand me that one.
Yeah.
Here you go.
The air's kind of stale already.
You starting to feel drowsy?
[Sighs] Yeah, maybe a little, sir.
[Thumping]
Collins, gangway.
[Tapping Morse Code]
Harris, you getting this?
Yes, sir.
What are they doing, sir?
They're gonna blast away the rock that's keeping us over at this angle.
That'll let us right ourselves.
Then comes the D.S.R.V.
[Chuckles]
Simple.
They've flipped out.
All right. Take it easy.
Now, listen.
Everybody keep alert.
Really on your toes. That's gonna be one hell of a big shock wave hitting this boat.
I don't think the door of that control room back there'll hold.
Chances are we'll lose the next compartment here too.
Maybe it'll act as a cushion.
All right, secure all loose gear.
Do what you can to protect the injured men.
Remember, the boat will roll to port.
Captain, do you really think this'll work?
[Chuckles] Caruso, what can I tell ya?
It'll either work or blow us to kingdom come.
All right.
Now move it right up so the base is flush against that rock.
Easy, Gates.
Why doesn't he shut up?
Yeah. I'm nervous enough as it is.
You're doing great for an amateur.
Thanks, Captain.
I needed that.
[Sighs] Let's get the hell out of here.
Oh, yeah.
That really gets the adrenaline going.
[Chuckles] We all set?
Yeah. All I have to do now... is push that little plunger up there.
Okay. Bennett, we're comin' up.
All right, stand by to bring Snark aboard.
Charges will be detonated right after its arrival.
Pass the word to D.S.R.V. They will prepare to launch one minute after that. Aye, sir.
Now all hands stand alert...
on D.S.R.V. launching stations.
Be prepared to launch on command.
Personnel, take their positions
and await launching signal.
Here we go.
That's it. That's it.
That's it. Come on. Bring her down.
Be ready with the ladder.
Standing by to transfer you to Pigeon, sir. Thank you.
Do you operate this?
No, sir. Only the lieutenant.
Thanks, Waters.
Bennett, I'm goin' back down.
[Bennett] Gates? I have to.
How else are we gonna know?
All right.
But go easy, will you?
Don't get too close, Captain.
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
Come on. Come on.
I gotta get in there first.
Two's a crowd this time, Mickey.
Now, wait a minute.
Just hold it!
Take her down.
Sir!
All right, let's go!
Both the D.S.R.V. and Snark on this?
Aye, sir.
D.S.R.V., this is Bennett.
Stand by.
Roger. Standing by to launch.
Gates, give yourself a safe margin.
So long as I can see her.
1300, Gates.
That's close enough.
Make it 1400.
I'll throw in an extra pair of pants.
Okay, brace yourself.
Hold on tight.
Get a good grip.
Here we go.
[Sighs]
All right.
Come on.
[Gates] I got her, Captain.
[Bennett] Yes, we see her.
Prepare to detonate.
Waters, this is Bennett.
Stand by for countdown.
Fifteen seconds from mark.
Fourteen, thirteen,
twelve, eleven,
ten, niner, eight,
seven, six,
five, four,
three, two, one.
Execute!
Come on, make it work!
Come on!
It's gotta work!
Come on!
It's going over the edge.
Gates!
No! No! Goddamn it, no!
It's working.
It's working!
They're holding firm.
Launch the D.S.R.V. [Man On Radio] Roger.
Launching underway.
Page, that compartment's flooded, right?
It sure is, Captain.
Let's start getting the badly injured men up to the escape hatch.
They'll be the first ones out. Come on.
Move it. They'll be here any minute.
Captain, can I take my camera, sir?
Caruso, no personal belon...
Oh, stick it in your shirt.
Come on. Come on.
Be gentle.
One at a time.
One at a time.
That's it. Be careful.
[Chattering Continues]
You the fella that called for a bucket of chicken?
Yeah. What took you so long?
Hand down the oxygen.
Tell them to move it.
Not too stable here.
Hook those up down there.
All right, shoes off, everybody.
Let's move it. We haven't got all day.
Come on, guys.
Caruso, give me some help.
Fowler, you're in the first load.
But, sir, I think I should be...
All right, knock it off.
That's an order.
Yes, sir.
Easy, son.
Come on. Come on!
Watch his ribs.
[Blanchard] All right.
Keep it moving.
I got ya.
Come on.
Take it easy.
[Man] Man, move it! Come on! Move it!
Pigeon Control, come in.
Over. Pigeon Control.
[Man]
We read you. Over.
Captain Bennett here.
Is the first load coming up yet?
This is Pigeon. The first load of rescuees to board the D.S.R.V., they're lifting off at this time.
[Bennett] Roger.
Let's go!
Okay, let's get those stretchers in here!
Coming through there!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
[Cheering]
[Gates] What about the injured, Captain?
[Bennett] They've all been removed and are being taken care of. Over.
[Gates]
How about the D.S.R.V.?
[Bennett] It's in good shape, Gates.
Everything's on schedule. Over.
[Gates] When will it launch?
[Bennett] It submerged a few minutes ago.
[Gates] Good.
[Bennett] Conditions holding down there?
[Gates] For the moment.
D.S.R.V. in sight.
Let's go, Captain.
All right, hit it.
Let's go. Move it.
She's slippin' off.
Hanson, don't stop! Keep moving! Yes, sir.
Over the ledge.
That's it.
Move it out, boys.
Keep it movin'.
Close it up there.
That's the stuff.
D.S.R.V., get out, fast!
[Blanchard]
All right. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on! Make it!
Come on! Come on!
What are you doing, sir?
It stopped.
Something's holding us. Let's go!
Get outta there!
He can't hear you, sir.
Excuse me. Gates...
[Continues, Indistinct]
[Bell Ringing]
[Man Over P.A.]
Neptune arriving.
Paul.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Thank you.
Congratulations, sir.
Thanks.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Thanks.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Thank you.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Thank you.
Welcome aboard, sir.
Thanks.
This is a routine pursuit.
Main Force repeats, this is a routine pursuit. Code 44.
Listen, you tell them we need help.
This should be an open-code blitz and you know it.
You have your information.
Come on, sweetheart, this one's a heavyweight!
Main Force repeats, you have your information.
This is a routine pursuit.
Please liaise with Big Bopper.
Jesus, March Hare to Big Bopper.
Assist on Code 3 Red Alert.
Big Bopper. Gotcha, Hare.
What's going down?
- We've got a cop-killer.
- You're kidding!
Be warned, Sarse...
... this is non-compliance.
The Main Force will not tolerate such action.
This pursuit is designated a standard Code 44.
Please respond only to that code.
Code 44 indicates no requirement for a blockade.
A Pursuit Special has been stolen.
Hall Captain Fifi Macaffee doesn't like this any more than you.
However, we must not compromise territorial range.
Remember that only by following instructions...
... can we hope to maintain a successful highway program.
March Hare to Big Bopper.
We're three minutes off the intersection.
Can you make it?
We'll make it! Move over!
I'm driving!
Not this again! I've been assigned!
Hang on. I'm supposed to drive this crate!
Hey, Sarse, what's the form on this thing?
A twisto bikey, scoot jockey.
A few hours ago, down in Sun City, he goes berserk.
Breaks custody, wastes a young premmie and takes off in a Pursuit Special.
We've been on him ever since.
This one's right up the air, Roop.
I've seen the style before.
Terminal psychotic.
What's he driving?
That's what hurts. It's one of our V8s.
Pursuit Special on methane. Very toey!
We're about half a mile off Anarchy Road.
You'll see him any minute now.
Rip the guts out of it. Give it the B-Jesus!
See him yet?
Got it!
I'm gonna blow him away!
I'm gonna ram him!
Hey, fellas, you okay?
Acknowledge, Big Bopper.
Acknowledge, are you okay?
Do you see me, Toecutter?
Do you see me, man?
Keep going, we're okay.
We got you, we're going.
Born with a steering wheel in his hand...
... and lead in his foot.
He is the Nightrider...
... cruising at the speed of fright!
I am the Nightrider, and we ain't never coming back!
I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine!
I am a rocker! I am a roller!
I think we're still mobile.
For Christ's sake, shove over!
You're blaspheming again.
I don't have to work with a blasphemer.
I am the Nightrider!
Big Bopper to March Hare.
We're still in the game, okay?
Understand this.
That scag and his floozy...
...they're gonna die!
Main Force to Gosling One.
Code 44, standard pursuit. Please respond.
MFP to Gosling One.
Main Force to Gosling One.
It was like slow motion.
He leaves his seat and goes through the windscreen...
...headfirst straight into the tree, right?
And then bounces back through the windscreen.
By the time we got to him, he was just sitting there...
...trying to scream with his face ripped off.
What's the matter?
Not hungry, am I?
Give it here.
- I'll tell you what"..."
- Look at that.
- Christ!
- Strewth, at it again.
Catch you later, Goose.
Christ, they're heading for population!
What's this I hear about you and Jonathan?
- What about him?
- You were seen with him two nights ago.
So what?
It's this way.
He's gone.
Bastards!
Shit!
You're gonna get it this time.
- He had his indicator on.
- Shut up!
No, you're not going on. Stay off the road!
Of course, I'm going on. Shut up!
People's lives are in peril!
Stay off the roads!
I'm gonna have him!
Stay off the roads!
Get off the roads!
- I got him! Shut up!
- Stay off the roads!
Oh, my God.
I am ready.
I am ready for your best.
Oh, my God, what happened?
I don't know, man. I just got here myself.
I think he broke his leg.
I want to find out what's happening.
Max, can you hear me?
Main Force Patrol...
...we're out of the game...
...unable to continue pursuit.
You'd better send a meat truck.
Charlie's copped the saucer in the throat.
Hey, Max?
Max?
Go ahead.
We are 100 percent SNAFUed.
You okay, Goose?
Nothing a year in the tropics wouldn't fix.
Much damage?
You should see the damage, Bronze!
Metal damage...
... brain damage?
You listening, Bronze?
I am the Nightrider!
I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine.
I am a rocker! I am a roller!
I am an out-of-controller!
I am the Nightrider, baby...
... and it's me and my Marmaduke, and we ain't never coming back.
The Toecutter, he knows who I am.
I am the Nightrider!
I am the chosen one, the mighty hand of vengeance...
... sent down to strike the unroadworthy!
I'm hotter than a rolling dice.
Step right up, chum, and watch the kid...
...lay down a rubber road right to freedom!
What's wrong?
- Baby, what's wrong!
- Nothing.
It's going.
There'll be nothing left. It's all gone.
Stop!
That feels good.
After three days, that feels so good.
I got a right hook in the mouth this morning.
Sprog?
I told him to always lead with his left.
You know, I think we've got a monster on our hands.
Yeah, takes after his old man.
What's that?
Monster!
Montazano, who called himself the Nightrider...
... had broken from custody and escaped in the police vehicle.
You made the news again.
Who was he?
I don't know.
Just another glory rider, I guess.
Jessie, I told you.
The Goose wants me there early.
What for, he didn't say.
You know the Goose.
Coffee's ready.
I'm not grumpy.
Get out of here.
Okay.
I gotta go.
What's that?
Crazy about you.
All supplies must be requisitioned from the people's bond.
Please do not exploit your privileges.
Doing so is an offense.
Memorandum Seven:
The Captains of the Hall have asked that pursuit officers...
... refrain from using the slang "Bronze" for the Main Force Patrol.
The word is considered disrespectful...
... and citizens should be actively discouraged from its use.
Memorandum Eight.
Hospital vouchers are available again.
MFP personnel may sign on with the following sector captains.
One, six three, two four, one one two...
... five seven, and two six.
Kick it in the guts, Barry.
She's the last of the V8s.
You can shut the gate on this one.
It's the duck's guts.
Yeah, she's the last of the V8s.
Sucks nitro.
Phase 4 head.
- Twin overhead cam.
- Tell him about the blower.
- 600 horsepower.
- The blower, man.
She's meanness put to music and the bitch is born to run.
- He's in a coma, man!
- He loves it.
How the hell did you get all this together?
It just happened, Max, you know?
A piece from here and a piece from there.
- So easy?
- Yeah.
Come on, Max. You've seen it.
You've heard it...
...and you're still asking questions.
When do we go for a ride?
He loves it.
I think we've got him.
I hope so.
Yeah, we've got him.
Your top pursuit man wants to quit the road...
...and we have to seduce him with candy?
People don't believe in heroes anymore.
I know, Macaffee. You want to give them back their heroes.
You will not try this one on me again.
I do not enjoy wasting money.
Goodbye...
...and good luck!
Thanks, Labatouche.
You're a real human being.
Get out of my way!
The old meat grinder's humming tonight?
Yeah, Max took out a couple of crazies over the high side.
Will you shut up!
The hot mops and the towees.
It's in the food.
Another one for your books, eh?
Have you eaten yet?
No, not yet. I'll pick up something later.
That Code 3 you ran down a few days ago"..."
- The Nightrider?
- The Nightrider, yeah.
- Got a problem.
- What's that?
His friends. Word is they're out to get you.
- Scoot jockeys?
- Yeah, nomad trash.
Well, I'll add it to my threat collection.
Good boy, Max. You're a good boy.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
We're here to meet a friend.
Come in on the train.
Nothing come in on the train except a couple of crates and a...
...coffin.
Our friend.
You'll have to see the agent and sign the papers.
Where do we find...
...this agent?
Wait.
That must be your friend there.
Didn't leave much of him.
Must have cut his heart out?
Yes, that's what I meant.
Poor bastard.
The Nightrider.
That is his name.
The Nightrider.
The Nightrider.
Remember him...
...when you look at the night sky.
I will.
Take your hat off.
Anything you say.
Anything I say.
What a wonderful philosophy you have.
Take him away.
Bubba. Johnny.
Push me, shove you!
Oh, yeah? Says who?
Nightrider!
Nightrider!
Nightrider!
No worries.
Anyway, my name is Jim Goose.
Rockatansky.
We have incident at Wee Jerusalem.
Nomad bikers, bulk trouble.
Okay, we're on it. We gone.
Goose, come on.
What's this?
It's a "Get Out Of Jail Free" card.
- Any more details?
- No.
Okay, we're gone.
- Max, he looks"..."
- Yeah.
Hey, fella, stop!
Hey, fella, stop!
What a turkey!
Hey, fella, you're a turkey, you know that?
We'll come back for him later.
There's more up ahead.
Nightrider. My "Niqueur."
Pursuit units in sectors, eight, nine and ten.
A cyclecade of nomad bikers.
A fast run out of Wee Jerusalem.
Your instructions are to locate.
Do not engage.
Sector Eight. Nomad bikers.
Bronze!
Gonna get you!
It's okay.
It's all right. No one's gonna hurt you.
It's all right.
This one's whacked out of his skull.
Whacked right out of his skull, man!
He ain't never coming back.
It's all right.
I'm gonna let this go now.
I know you're frightened, girl...
...but no one's gonna hurt you anymore.
My name's Jim Goose, and everything's gonna be all right.
The Nightrider!
Hey, Jimbo.
- Remember that Code 3?
- Yeah.
Remember him when you look up"..."
Nightrider!
Well, well, well.
Johnny the Boy has done it again.
This time it's a scrubber.
He's never gonna learn.
But we are going to teach him, Bubba.
You are going back for him.
No way! Not me, not for him!
But it's not for him.
It's for me, Bubba.
You're wasting your time!
The Scag don't rate!
He's nothing like the Nightrider!
Code seven progress, eight one.
Code seven progress, eight three.
Code seven eight six, eight one, eight zero.
MFP Code 1.
Captain Macaffee in convoy from the courthouse to the Halls of Justice.
Code one progress.
Hey, mister.
What happened to the car?
What do you think happened?
Looks like it was chewed up and spat out.
Perhaps it's the result of an anxiety.
Hey, Roop.
Stay here, mate.
I think they're out there.
Take your time, Charlie.
We got plenty of it.
Good day and good luck.
I can see the Interceptor.
What do you say, Scag?
Got no place special to go?
We'd better prep him.
Scag, did you bring your toothbrush?
- You'll have to sit on the Goose.
- Why?
No contest.
Hey, Fif! What's going on?
- What happened?
- Let him go.
What's he mean, "Let him go"?
Who's this?
- Keep out of this.
- What's going on?
No one showed, okay?
Forget it, Charlie. Just let him go.
No one showed. No one.
What's he mean, "No one showed"?
They didn't show.
Nobody! The punks didn't show.
The girl didn't show, the townspeople didn't show.
Nobody showed!
We're screwed! It's the law.
What do you mean, "No one showed"?
Where were you, man?
It means, old man, you haven't got a case.
No contest.
Jesus Christ! You're not gonna let him walk out the door, Fifi?
That's exactly what you're going to do!
- Shut up!
- Keep going, Charlie!
It's alright.
Hey, Bronze, look at you, a cripple and a mute!
Scag, he sings and I tap dance!
Hey, you know what you are?
The courts will hear about this.
I promise they'll hear about this disgrace.
He wearing that face for a bet or does he really look that stupid?
This man is grossly offensive!
Get him out of here, Max!
- I can make a case of it!
- What case, you fool?
You saw what they did to that girl!
For God's sake, she was the town bike!
He's my prisoner, and he's not walking out that door!
- Get him out of here!
- Who is this guy?
Goose, settle down, boy.
Jesus, Fifi.
Fifi, Jesus.
Look, they're laughing at us!
Can't you see they're laughing at us?
They don't believe us!
See you later, Goose.
It's been a pleasure.
Skiffington, go home. Go.
Goose!
You can't do anything about it!
We know who you are, Bronze!
We'll see you on the road, Scag!
See you on the road like we saw the Nightrider!
We remember the Nightrider, and we know who you are!
Okay.
So long as the paperwork is clean, you boys can do what you like out there.
Here he is, the walking armpit!
There's a fire in my belly, and she's the woman to put it out.
Off, brute!
This angel is hot in the tubes for me!
I'm on fire!
Joviality is a game of children.
- She's mine.
- I should be a surgeon with these hands.
Mudguts, get out of there!
Cundalini, put her against the post.
We have a problem here.
She is not what she seems.
Bubba Zanetti has it on good authority...
...she's sent by the Bronze, full of treachery.
The Bronze, take our pride.
If you're gonna waste the Bronze, you gotta do it big!
You just don't have the style, do you, chicken shit?
Goes to water on a dummy.
It's all right. It's okay.
Just remember...
...to keep your sweet...
...sweet mouth shut!
MFP to Gosling One.
Main Force Patrol to Gosling One.
We have a curfew violation.
MFP, Gosling One.
Gosling One.
Code 333 in progress.
Main Force.
Would someone inform the Goose...
Yeah, baby!
All units again progress.
All units again progress.
All units again progress.
... units to Three Day Angel Patrol.
Nice to have you back Big Bopper Two.
Sun City Sector 3,
Code 4 Trauma in progress.
Sun City Sector 9, Code 4 in progress.
MFP Eight One.
A Memorandum:
For the cannibalization...
MFP, copy.
Hey, it's the Goose.
You're a lucky boy. Not even a road rash.
Hey, Midge...
...don't write off the Goose, until you see the box going into the hole.
Yeah, well, don't wreck me truck now.
- I'll bring it back tomorrow.
- Yeah, no hurry.
Hey, you sure you're all right?
Couldn't be righter.
Jimmy the Goose, larger than life and twice as ugly!
Light me, Johnny.
Light another.
This is a threshold moment, Johnny.
Step through.
Toecutter, this isn't what I want.
Light it!
The Bronze, they keep you from being proud.
Look at him. He looks silly, doesn't he, upside down?
Do it for freedom and the Nightrider!
I can't. No!
You scum-sucking trash!
Throw it!
I can't stand the pain!
Max.
That "thing" in there, that's not the Goose.
No way.
I was hungry.
Peanut butter and honey.
I just can't get it clear in my head, Jess.
He was so full of living, you know.
He ran the franchise on it.
Now there's nothing.
Here I am, trying to put sense to it...
...when I know there isn't any.
I'll be all right, once I get it clear in my head.
- What's this?
- I'm through.
- Again?
- No, not again.
- I'm through. I'm quitting.
- Sit down.
No, I didn't come here to discuss it,
I came to say it. I'm through.
Now, just a minute!
All right, so the Goose bought it.
That's the way he always came at the world.
Off beat.
Max, you'd be the first to admit it was long overdue.
All right, I'll tell you how it is.
You're a winner, Max.
You're on the top shelf...
...and I'm not gonna lose you because of some crazy notion about quitting!
They say people don't believe in heroes anymore.
Well, damn them!
You and me, Max...
...we're gonna give them back their heroes.
Do you really expect me to go for that crap?
You gotta admit,
I sounded good there for a minute?
'Bye, Fifi.
Come on, do you want me to beg?
Do you want me on my knees, crying?
Now just a minute.
Give me a reason.
I'm scared, Fif.
Do you know why?
It's that rat circus out there.
I'm beginning to enjoy it.
What is this, funny week?
Any longer out on that road, and I'm one of them, you know?
A terminal crazy.
Only, I've got a bronze badge to say I'm one of the good guys.
You know what I'm trying to say?
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Take off a few weeks?
Grow yourself a beard.
Draw flies. Just think about it for a while.
If you still feel the same way when you come back, it's okay by me.
Go on.
I'm not gonna change my mind.
Get out of here before I decide to come with you.
'Bye, Fif. Thank you.
You'll be back, Rockatansky!
You're hooked, Max.
And you know it!
I've never been able to say things to you,
Jess, about how I feel.
Guess I always counted on you understanding.
When I was a kid...
...me and my father used to go for long walks.
I remember staring down at his shoes.
They were special shoes, brown.
And he always kept them really shiny.
He was tall, and he used to take long strides.
And there I'd be right alongside him...
...just trying to keep up with him.
I don't think he ever knew how proud I felt of him.
Or how good it felt just to be there alongside him.
Even now, when I think back on it,
I still feel"..."
The thing is, Jess...
...I couldn't tell him about it then, but I can tell you about it now.
I don't wanna wait 10 years to tell you how I'm feeling about you right now.
Get a load of that!
We had a blowout a while back.
Raunchy, very raunchy.
What's the donk like?
Yeah, the donk's fine.
Look, about this tire"..."
Don't do much work on these myself, except to scrape 'em off the road.
Yeah. Hey, how about this tire?
Have it fixed in no time.
I can sell you a set of 'lops for next to nothing.
I can't remember where I got 'em, but I got 'em, know what I mean?
No, we'll be all right just as soon as we get this fixed.
- Max?
- Yeah?
Listen...
...Sproggo's talked me into buying him an ice cream, so...
...I think I'll see you later.
Sure, there's a shop just down the beach.
They'll appreciate the business.
Sure, thanks.
Toodlepip.
You just trucking around?
Good time for just trucking.
Wish I could do a bit myself.
Which way you heading? North?
Maybe.
Look what's turned up for Sunday dinner.
Main course and dessert.
My favorite kind:
Female.
Watch the tongue, lovable.
I've seen him lick his own eyebrow clean.
Must've spent some coin.
Like the sign says, speed's just a question of money.
How fast do you wanna go?
- Max, quick, get in.
- What's wrong?
Just take my word for it, get in!
- What about the tire?
- Please, Max!
Your tire, man.
Hey, fella, what about your tire!
Hey, fella, what about your tire!
Crazy people!
The world's full of crazy people.
That wagon, was it here?
A couple with a kid.
I was just fixing their tire.
They left their goddamn spare.
Not a bad one either.
- Who are they?
- A couple, passing through.
Said they were heading north. Maybe.
You want to drive the car? Yeah?
Well, we wouldn't have a car anymore.
Into the back.
Here you go.
I can still see his face now.
Looked as if he'd just swallowed a brick.
What a mean old lady you are. Huh, boss?
That's enough from you, mate! Enough.
What's the matter with you?
What you got there, mate?
Yeah, that's the way I see it, too.
Sure. It's been nice talking to you". '"Bye.
Take it you agreed with him.
They're not worried, I'm not worried.
What about that?
I figure it's lost property.
If no one makes a claim to it,
I say we can forget it.
Sounds okay to me, Jess.
Don't know.
If Ziggy says so, believe me, it's okay.
May's expecting you up at the farm sometime.
You'll have no more trouble up there.
Just green grass.
How are you doing?
I'm getting there.
I reckon you ought to connect the doohickey to the gizmo.
Come here, you.
You touch me with those hands and I'll rip you apart. No!
Look at them! No!
May told me about the little beach down by the trees. Do you want to come?
Love to.
Except that I've gotta fix the fan belt, or we're never gonna get outta here.
Okay, Tarzan,
I'll bring you back some bananas.
If you meet Benno down there, don't let him bother you.
He's only a baby.
Sure, May.
- The men.
- What men?
Now you calm down and you tell me what's the matter.
Very, very naughty.
- Now, you tell May what you...
- May.
May, you call The Dark One.
And you tell him to get here as fast as he can.
Why? What's going on?
I think we've got some hoon trouble.
It's gonna be all right.
Come on, darling. Come on, Jessie.
Well, let's go into the house.
You've had an awful time, darling.
But it's all over now.
Everything's going to be all right.
I've just got to go and make a phone call...
...and then we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
The Dark One, and hurry it up, will you?
It's May Swaisey.
Sprog? Oh, no!
Sprog?
Sprog!
Sprog!
Well, well, well.
It's our little mother.
That there is Cundalini...
...and Cundalini wants his hand back.
I want my baby.
Tell you what...
...l'll swap you.
Please, give me my baby.
Jessie.
You've not got a sense of humor.
You've got a pretty face, though.
Awful pretty.
Awful pretty.
I suppose...
...you don't need a sense of humor with a pretty face.
The only trouble is though, missy...
...if you should...
...lose the face...
Please, don't hurt my baby.
...you've got nothing!
What do you want from me?
- Don't change the subject.
- Hold it!
- Don't change the subject.
- Hold it!
Right there!
- I hate guns.
- Old lady.
Stand back!
- Stay back!
- Woman!
Stay back!
Anyone so much as breathes,
I'll cheese him!
Open that door.
Everyone of you, in there.
Put the babe on the ground.
Jessie, get the van.
Don't stop. Just go right through.
Now what?
- The motor!
- What are you trying to say?
I don't know, it just died on me.
Jessie!
Where?
Lord, have mercy!
What do you reckon?
I'm a doctor, not a fortuneteller.
This your subdural?
- Yes, that's her.
- Lot of problems?
Multiple traumas, spleen, liver, lung, flail chest...
...left neck of femur, renal shutdown.
Reads like a grocery list. She salvageable?
Yeah, sure, we got all her signs back last night.
- Relatives?
- The husband.
They lost the kid. DOA.
Listen, tell him she's going to be all right.
Tell him not to worry.
Tell him, if he wants, I'll talk to him.
I don't think he wants to talk to anyone.
He's been standing there like a zombie all day.
Bubba Zanetti, is that you?
You come for the grunt?
She won't be ready until this afternoon.
Still having trouble with the front forks.
They're mongrels to work with.
You asshole!
What the molly fuck you think you're doing?
You and me are gonna talk about the Toecutter.
Never heard of him.
What the Christ are you?
I wanna know about the tattoo.
I mind my own business, don't I?
I mean, they'll kill me, won't they?
I'll say the names, and you say "yes" or "no"."
Nightrider...
...Toecutter, Bubba Zanetti.
- Yes.
There's more?
- Johnny.
- Johnny the Boy?
- Yeah. Some others.
- Where?
Out at the beaches, looking for fuel.
Are they coming back?
I don't know. They gotta get their bikes.
For Christ's sake!
I don't know.
Code Unspecified.
We have a query locate on a black Pursuit Special.
Unauthorized use by a Main Force Officer.
This is designated as a potential
Code 3 Red Alert.
Quit toying, Bubba.
Easy. I know what I'm doing.
Hi.
This isn't what it looks, man.
I just came down here to check it out, and...
...this guy, he's already snuffed it.
Nothing you could do for him.
Ankle.
It's okay.
What are you doing, man?
Hey, listen, I had nothing to do with anything going on back there, man.
Listen, man, will you? Listen to me!
They were a hell of a lot of crazy people back there, man.
Some kind of bad people.
I'm not responsible for anything.
What are you doing, man?
What do you say? What are you doing?
Hey, listen. I'm not a bad man.
I'm sick, see? Sick.
What do you call it?
Psychopathic, you know.
Personality disorder.
The court, man, he said so.
You're not gonna hurt me, are you?
Jesus! You can't kill me!
Not for stealing a man's boots!
He was dead, for Christ's sake!
He won't need 'em anymore.
What are you doing?
I wanna know what you're doing.
The chain in those handcuffs is high-tensile steel.
It'd take you ten minutes to hack through it with this.
Now, if you're lucky...
...you could hack through your ankle in five minutes.
Go.
You're mad, man!
You think I look silly, don't you?
Don't bring this on me, man.
Don't do this to me!
Please, sweet Jesus. I was sick!
Please, sweet Jesus. I was sick!
Don't bring this on me, please!

WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?
[WHISTLES]

SO HE OUGHTA BE SCOOTIN' UP
HERE ANY MINUTE TO CHANGE.
HEY, ED,

O'MALLEY'S BARBECUE
AND MADE OFF WITH 87 GRAND

WHO?
THE QUESTION IS...WHO ?
WHOEVER IT WAS
JUST MISSED.
ANOTHER COUPLE OF INCHES, AND WE WOULD'VE
BROUGHT YOU HIS BRAINS IN A SAUCER.
OH, YEAH? WHO DID IT?
I JUST ASKED YOU THAT.
O'MALLEY
RATTED ON THE MAFIA.
REMEMBER?
COULD'VE BEEN THEM.

DON'T NEVER FORGET.
COULD BE
HIS NUMBER'S UP,
UNLESS DIGGER AND ME
GET TO HIM FIRST.
WHERE IS HE?
WELL, HOW ABOUT IT?
HIDIN' OUT,
HE AIN'T GOT A CHANCE, IRIS.
DEKE O'MALLEY
ALWAYS HAS A CHANCE.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
HELLO, BETTY?
GIVE ME THAT!
ALL RIGHT, O'MALLEY, DO
YOURSELF A FAVOR AND COME IN--

GOD DAMN IT, ED,

IS CRAZY! I WANT HIM OUT!
I GOT HIM, IRIS.
2 DAYS, 2 WEEKS,

IT'S ALL THE SAME.
I'M NAILING HIS ASS

BE SMART, IRIS.
GET OFF THE BOAT
BEFORE WE SINK IT.
[ DOORBELL RINGS ]
ED. DIGGER.

O'MALLEY SQUEAL. WHAT ?
THEY FOUND THE MEAT TRUCK AND THE
GOLDEN MONEY WAGON ALL SMASHED UP.
ONE GOT KILLED.
O'MALLEY?

LIEUTENANT WANTS YOU TWO
GUYS UP THERE RIGHT AWAY.

HARLEM RIVER YARD.
OH, BY THE WAY, WHAT'S

NO SWEAT THERE.
FOUND SOME CONFETTI.
WHERE'S THE LOOT?
ASK O'MALLEY.
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT O'MALLEY. DO YOU ?
YOU MAKE HIM?
YEAH. HE'S A PICKPOCKET
NAMED EARLY RISER.
HE WAS AT THE RALLY.
HE WORKS WITH A PARTNER
NAMED LO BOY, A JUNKIE.
THEY WORKED
THE HOLY DREAM.
COULD BE THE MILITANTS, ED.
THEY HATE O'MALLEY'S GUTS.
NO. THEY WOULDN'T
PULL A JOB LIKE THIS.
IT AIN'T THEIR STYLE.
HEY, ED!
WHAT IS IT?
LOOK AT THIS.
COTTON FROM INSIDE
THE MEAT TRUCK.
ONE THING'S FOR SURE:
IT AIN'T DRUGSTORE COTTON.
WHAT IS IT?
IT'S RAW,
UNPROCESSED COTTON,
LIKE FROM A BALE.
AH. IT'S A LONG TIME
SINCE I SEEN COTTON LIKE THAT.
DIGGER, YOU AIN'T NEVER
SEEN NO RAW COTTON BEFORE.
YOU WAS BORN AND RAISED RIGHT
HERE IN NEW YORK, JUST LIKE ME.
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?
DIGGER FOUND
A HIDDEN DROP SLOT.
THIS WAS IN IT.
IT'S FULL OF TRASH.
THE SYNDICATE.
WHEN O'MALLEY WAS WITH 'EM, HE TALKED,
AND THEY THREATENED TO GET HIM.
WHY'D THEY WAIT?
WHITE GUNS COMIN' UP HERE,
TRYING TO KNOCK OFF
REVEREND O'MALLEY, YOU THINK?
COULD BE.
BLACKS FIND OUT ABOUT THIS,
THERE'LL BE HELL TO PAY.
I WANT ROUND THE CLOCK POLICE
PROTECTION FOR REVEREND O'MALLEY.
TO HELL WITH O'MALLEY!
WHAT ABOUT THE $87,000
OF POOR BLACK FOLKS' MONEY
THAT HE STOLE FROM ALL
OVER THIS COUNTRY? STOLE?
THAT'S RIGHT. STOLE!
WE RAN A CHECK ON
O'MALLEY'S ENTIRE OPERATION.
IT'S CLEAN.
ABSOLUTELY LEGITIMATE.
FULL CLEARANCE FROM
THE STATE DEPARTMENT,
SECURITIES EXCHANGE
COMMISSION,
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK. WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?
WHAT THE HELL DOES THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL, THE STATE DEPARTMENT,
OR EVEN THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES KNOW
ABOUT ONE GODDAMNED THING THAT'S
GOING ON UP HERE IN HARLEM?
ED O'MALLEY'S RESPECTED BY
RESPONSIBLE PEOPLE. RESPECT, MY ASS!
PASTORS, RACE LEADERS,
POLITICIANS,
NOT TO MENTION THE LARGE FOLLOWING
HE HAS AMONG BLACK FOLK EVERYWHERE.
BLACK FOLK NEED HOPE
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
WHAT IS IT
WITH YOU PEOPLE?
ONE OF YOU LIKE REVEREND
O'MALLEY TRIES TO DO SOMETHING,
DOES ANYBODY TRY TO
HELP HIM? HELL NO!
YOU'RE AFTER HIM
LIKE CRABS IN A BASKET.
UH, HOW MANY SHARES OF THE BACK TO
AFRICA, INC. WOULD YOU BUY, CAPTAIN?
THAT'S IMPERTINENT.
THE HELL IT IS!
ONE MORE WORD OUT OF YOU, AND
I'LL RUN YOU RIGHT OFF THE LOT.
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO TEACH
WHITE FOLKS ALL OUR LIVES.
SCHOOL'S OVER.
LET'S GO LOOK FOR LO BOY
AT JUNKIES' PARADISE.
DAMN IT, ANDERSON. WHO'S IN
CHARGE OF THIS INVESTIGATION,
YOU OR THEM?
YOU'VE GOTTA UNDERSTAND
ED AND DIGGER, SIR.
I UNDERSTAND THOSE TWO,
ALL RIGHT.
TOO QUICK
WITH THEIR FISTS,
TOO FLIP WITH THEIR TALK,
TOO FAST WITH THEIR GUNS.
THEY'RE TWO DAMN BLACK MANIACS
ON A POWDER KEG,
AND YOU'RE
LETTING THEM RUN WILD.
ED AND DIGGER, THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SPECIAL
WAY OF DEALING WITH THINGS UP HERE.
AND IF THEY FIND SOMETHING
KINKY ON REVEREND O'MALLEY,
I'VE GOTTA RESPECT IT.
SISTER!
YES?
GOOD AFTERNOON, SISTER.
AND WHAT KIND OF TRICK ARE YOU TRYING
TO PLAY ON ME, YOU OLD UNCLE TOM?
AIN'T NO TRICK, MA'AM.
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET THIS
BALE OF COTTON ONTO MY CART.
COTTON?
YES, MA'AM.
AND I WAS JUST WONDERIN'
IF SOME GOOD, NICE-LOOKIN',
STRONG CHRISTIAN LADY LIKE
YOU WOULDN'T GIVE ME A HAND.
I AM A CHRISTIAN.
THAT'S WHY I DON'T TAKE A
STICK AND KNOCK YOUR TEETH OUT.
ALL OF YOU TRYING
TO STEAL MY MONEY!
TRYIN' TO STEAL
YOUR MONEY?
YES! TRICKERS! THAT'S WHAT
YOU ARE. EVERY ONE OF YOU!
WHY, YOU OLD FOOL!
DON'T YOU THINK
I GOT SENSE ENOUGH TO KNOW
THERE AIN'T NO SUCH THING AS
A BALE OF COTTON IN HARLEM?
HMMPH!
Ed: THAT DAMN BRYCE
CHEWIN' MY ASS OUT.
DUMB ANDERSON
DIDN'T SAY A WORD.
WELL, HE'S GOT HIS OWN
MORTGAGE TO WORRY ABOUT.
I OUGHTA QUIT THIS JOB.
ALL RIGHT, NOW,
SUPPOSE YOU DO QUIT.
SUPPOSE YOU TELL 'EM TO
TAKE THE BADGE AND SHOVE IT.
WHO'S GONNA
PAY YOUR MORTGAGE?
YOU.
MM-MM!
NOT ME, BABY.
YOU QUIT, I QUIT.
THEN WHO'LL PROTECT THE BLACK
FOLKS FROM THE WHITE FOLKS?
WHO'S GONNA PROTECT THE
BLACK FOLKS FROM THEMSELVES?
I'M SICK OF THIS. GOTTA BE AT
DEATH'S DOOR. I'M TIRED OF THIS JAZZ.
[CHATTERING]
GOD DAMN.
AAH!
WHEN DID YOU TURN JAPANESE?
COME ON.
YOU KNOW THE POSITION.
COME ON,
SPREAD YOUR LEGS BACK.
FINALLY
GOT IT TOGETHER.
WE PLAN
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.
THIS AIN'T NO SHOOTING GALLERY
NO MORE. THIS IS SWAHILI CLASS.
SO WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
TAKE YOUR BUSINESS AND SPLIT?
LO BOY.
EARLY RISER'S PARTNER.
WE WANT HIM.
IS HE ON SWAHILI, TOO?
IF THAT'S WHO YOU WANT,
WHY DON'T YOU CHECK REBA'S?
[SPEAKING SWAHILI]
[SPEAKING SWAHILI]
WHERE'D YOU LEARN THEM
DIRTY SWAHILI WORDS?
ASK YOUR MAMA.
[CHUCKLES]
HOW LONG YOU GONNA
KEEP THIS UP, COPPER?
TILL IT'S OVER, SISTER.
IT'S BEEN 4 HOURS NOW, AND I'M
JUST SICK OF LOOKIN' AT YOU.
YOU ARE REALLY
ONE UGLY CHILD.
I MEAN,
IT'S REALLY TOO BAD
'CAUSE, UM...
IF YOU WASN'T,

I'LL PUT A SACK
OVER MY HEAD.

KNOCK IT OFF, WILL YA?
[CHUCKLES]
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF IT WAS GONNA FIT.
BUCK OFF.
DROP THEM SCISSORS.
WELL, YOU GOTTA
BREATHE, DON'T YOU?
DROP 'EM
OR I'LL BREAK YOUR ARM.
YOU'RE NOT A FAG,
ARE YOU?
OH, WOW. A FAG COP.
HA HA!

THAT SHIP AND YOU,
REVEREND O'MALLEY.
AND THANK YOU
FOR THE FLOWERS.
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES, MRS. HILL.
HE WAS MY RIGHT HAND.
AND I CANNOT FIND THE WORDS TO
EXPRESS THE INFINITE SORROW I FEEL
THAT THIS UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT
HAS TAKEN YOUR HUSBAND.
THANK YOU, REVEREND
O'MALLEY. YOU ARE SO KIND.
MAY I BE OF ANY ASSISTANCE
TO YOU, MRS. HILL?

THE ARRANGEMENTS?
I JUST WANT YOU

OF COURSE, MRS. HILL.
AND IF YOU'LL
FORGIVE MY ASKIN',
DO YOU NEED MONEY?
OH, THANK YOU,
REVEREND O'MALLEY,

AND WE SAVED UP.
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING
EVER,

I WON'T HEAR OF IT
OTHERWISE.

ALL RIGHT, SIR.
YOU'RE EVERYTHING
JOHN SAID YOU'D BE.
THANK YOU, MRS. HILL.

ALL I NEED IS
A PLACE OF OPERATION,

THE STOLEN FUNDS
AND TO AVENGE
JOHN'S DEATH?
WOULD YOU BE
MY EYES AND EARS?
MY MATA HARI, SO TO SPEAK,
ON THE LORD'S SIDE.
OH, ANYTHING.
OH, ANYTHING IF YOU THINK
I CAN, REVEREND O'MALLEY.
THE MAIN THING IS FOR ME
TO BE FREE OF THE POLICE
SO THAT I CAN CONDUCT
MY OWN INVESTIGATION.
I'VE GOT TO FIND
A PLACE TO STAY
WHERE NOBODY
WILL KNOW WHERE I AM.
REVEREND O'MALLEY,
WHY NOT STAY HERE?
OH, BLESS YOUR SOUL,
MRS. HILL.
HEY, COPPER.
I FORGOT MY TOWEL.
IT'S, UH, IT'S RIGHT THERE

'CAUSE ANYTHING

I'M THE GUY THAT'S
MAKIN' IT HAPPEN.
AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT.
STOP TRYING TO PLAY
BIG MAN, CASPAR.
WELL, DON'T THINK
IT AIN'T BEEN CHARMIN',
BUT, UH, I PROMISED
THESE LITTLE LADIES
I'D TAKE 'EM
FOR A LITTLE RIDE.
UH, I WOULD LOOK UPON IT KINDLY
IF YOU LET THE LITTLE LADIES GO
AND TOOK ME UP
TO ITALIAN HARLEM
TO YOUR
WHITE MAFIA BOSS MAN.
I SAID
MOO GOO GAI PAN.

MOO GOO GAI PAN?
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
NEVER MIND THAT.

AND TELL SAM TO
FIX IT FOR ME PERSONALLY.
THANK YOU, BROTHER CASPAR.
OH, SIT RIGHT DOWN
NEXT TO THE THRONE OF GRACE.
HEY.
SURE.  AIN'T YOU BOYS
"THE MAN"?
OH, SOMEDAY, MAYBE,
WHEN CASPAR GETS BALLS ENOUGH
TO RUN YOU OUT OF HARLEM.
BUT RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE THE MAN.
PIANO, PIANO.
HOW'S ABOUT A LITTLE LUMP
SUM OF FOOD ALL AROUND, HMM?
LITTLE TEA?
THEY THINK
WE HIT O'MALLEY.
KNOCK OFF A COLORED RALLY
AND START A RACE RIOT, MAYBE?
ARE YOU CRAZY?
YOU HAD IT IN FOR
O'MALLEY. DEKE?
NONSENSE.
I LIKED THE BOY.
ALWAYS HAVE.
HE'S A CREDIT
TO THE COMMUNITY.
HE RATTED ON YOU.
WHERE DO YOU THINK HE GOT THAT
INCOME TAX SHIT? WE FED IT TO HIM.
SO A COUPLE OF THE BOYS
MAYBE GOT A LITTLE OUT OF LINE.
SHOULD LEARN A LESSON.
HE DONE US A FAVOR.
IF WE DIDN'T LIKE HIM, YOU
THINK HE'D STILL BE AROUND?
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT MY TAKE
IN HARLEM IS IN ONE DAY?
YOU THINK I WOULD JEOPARDIZE
ALL OF THAT FOR A LOUSY $87,000?
ALL RIGHT. $5.00.
WHAT? CUT IT DOWN! I'LL TAKE
MY BALE TO OLD MAN COHEN.
WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT
DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
WHAT CAN I DO WITH THIS
PIECE OF JUNK, MAKE BANDAGES?
$10, AND THAT'S
THE LAST PRICE.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TRYIN' TO DO? LISTEN.
MY NAME IS HONEST ABE GOODMAN,
NOT HONEST ABE LINCOLN.
$15, AND THAT'S
MY VERY LAST PRICE.
THIS IS GENUINE
MISSISSIPPI COTTON.
SMELL OF IT.
SMELL, SCHMELL.
COTTON IS COTTON.
NOT THIS COTTON! I'VE PICKED
COTTON ALL OVER THE SOUTH,
AND THAT'S THE FINEST.
20. NOT A DIME MORE.
30, NOT A CENT LESS.
SOLD!
YES, SIR.
YOU'RE THE OLD GEEZER GOES

WELL, I'M IN THE MARKET
FOR A BALE OF COTTON.

HEY! HEY!

LOOK, WHITE MAN, AIN'T YOU A
LONG WAY FROM WHERE YOU LIVE?

[MEN CHATTERING]
IS IT BLACK ENOUGH
FOR YOU?
HEY, DEKE! HEY!
YEAH, ALL RIGHT!
MY MAN!
HEY.
GOOD TIMES

SCARED IN ALL MY LIFE.

COPS BEEN LEANING
ON YOU BOYS A BIT?
HELL NO. IT WAS YOU
WE WAS WORRYING ABOUT.
MAN, I THOUGHT
YOU WAS DEAD.
ARE YOU DUMB? THIS
MAN GOT BRAINS, BABY.
I HAD TO LAY LOW
FOR A WHILE.
BUT I WAS THINKING ABOUT
YOU BOYS ALL THE TIME.
AND NOW DEKE O'MALLEY'S
BACK IN TOWN.
AND YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.
AND THAT MEANS WE GONNA
TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS.
RIGHT, REVEREND?
'CAUSE I FOUND IT.
I FINALLY FOUND
THAT BALE OF COTTON.
BROTHER BARRY,
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.
WHERE IS
THAT BALE OF COTTON?
GOODMAN'S JUNKYARD.
GOODMAN'S JUNKYARD?
NOW, IS THAT
KOSHER ENOUGH FOR YOU?
HA HA HA!
DEKE O'MALLEY
AND ALL THE LITTLE FOXES
PRESENT
AND ACCOUNTED FOR.
HOLD ON THERE.
WHAT'S YOUR RUSH?
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOUR MAMA SAYS?
I DON'T PLAY THAT.
FIRST, BRER FOX
GOBBLES BRER RABBIT...
AND THEN THE WOLF
GOBBLES BRER FOX.
YOUR MOVE, MOTHER GOOSE.
OKAY. STAY PUT UNTIL YOU SEE
THE WHITE OF THE RABBIT'S ASS.
COME ON.
LET'S MOVE. MOVE OUT.
WHITE SHIT
ABOUT TO HIT BLACK FAN.
[BOOM]
AAH!
HELLO, REVEREND.
NOW BACK UP.
NICE AND EASY.
TURN AROUND!
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.
[GUNSHOT]
THE WHITE FOX?
HE LEFT TRACKS
ACROSS MY BEHIND.
THE BLACK FOX?
LIKEWISE.
BODY COUNT IS 6,
LIEUTENANT.
YEAH.
TO STEAL JUNK,
I CAN UNDERSTAND.
A MAN IS DESPERATE,
HE NEEDS THE MONEY.
BUT TO KILL FOR JUNK?
I DON'T GET IT.
DON'T BE A BOY SCOUT,
GOODMAN.
A LOT OF PEOPLE GET KILLED
EVERY DAY UP HERE FOR NOTHING.
WHAT COULD BE HERE THAT ANYONE
COULD POSSIBLY WANT THAT BADLY?
WHAT?
SEEN ANY COTTON
AROUND HERE LATELY?
A BALE OF COTTON, SURE.
UNCLE BUDD BROUGHT OVER
A BALE OF COTTON.
I BOUGHT IT FROM HIM
FOR $25.
WHERE IS IT NOW?
WHAT?
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?
HE CAME BACK LATER,
HE BOUGHT IT BACK
FROM ME FOR $30.
HE HAULED IT AWAY.
WAIT A MINUTE.
HE BROUGHT IT IN AND THEN
HE BRUNG IT OUT AGAIN?
IT DON'T ADD UP,
GOODMAN.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.
HAULED IT AWAY WHERE?
HE DIDN'T SAY.
PUT OUT A READER
ON UNCLE BUDD.
COME ON, DIGGER.
TO KILL FOR JUNK.
WELL! DID YOU FIND IT?
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE,
AN OUTRAGED CITIZEN?
OH, REVEREND
O'MALLEY.
DID YOU FIND THE MAN WHO
STOLE MY PEOPLE'S MONEY?
WHAT WERE YOU DOING AT THE JUNKYARD
THIS HOUR OF THE NIGHT, REVEREND?
HOLDING A REVIVAL MEETING?
HE WAS WHITE,
WHOEVER HE WAS.
YOU KNOW THE MAN?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
DO I KNOW HIM?
WHAT I MEAN, SIR, IS DID YOU
EVER MEET THE MAN BEFORE?
OH, SURE. SAME ONE
WHO HIJACKED THE RALLY.
FUNNY. ALL THE GUYS
AT THE RALLY HAD ON MASKS.
AND, OF COURSE, YOU COULD
SEE RIGHT THROUGH THE MASKS.
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU KNEW
THAT THEY WERE WHITE IN ADVANCE.
HAVE A CIGARETTE.
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?
MABEL HILL'S APARTMENT,
RIGHT WHERE YOU LEFT IT.
THAT'S POLICE BRUTALITY.
NO, BROTHER.
THAT'S
CANCER PREVENTION.
REVEREND O'MALLEY, THERE ARE
6 DEAD BODIES IN THE MORGUE.
ALL WE'RE ASKING YOU TO DO IS
-- NOW, LOOK!
HOW MANY TIMES DO I
HAVE TO TELL YOU IDIOTS?
WE'RE ONLY ASKING YOU TO TELL
US WHAT YOU KNOW. NOW, LOOK!
EASY, DIGGER, EASY.
LOOK, I AM DUE IN MY PULPIT
AT 11:00 THIS MORNING,
AND IF I AIN'T THERE--
IF MY PEOPLE WERE
TO FIND OUT
THAT YOU HAD ME LOCKED
UP IN THIS FILTHY,
PISSY PIGSTY, THERE'LL
BE ALL HELL TO PAY!
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
DRAW YOUR OWN
CONCLUSIONS.
AND YOU CAN TELL BRYCE, THE
COMMISSIONER, AND THE MAYOR!
REVEREND O'MALLEY--
TAKE ME BACK
TO MY CELL...HONKY!
O'MALLEY!
YOU FORGOT YOUR LIGHTER.
SOMETHING ELSE YOU FORGOT.
IRIS, BABY,
WHO HIT YOU?
YOU, YOU SON OF A BITCH!
BUT I GOT YOUR BLACK
ASS NOW! COOL IT!
DON'T TELL ME TO COOL IT!
YOU LEFT ME FOR THE COPS.
NIGGER, I OUGHTA KILL YOU!
YOU ALREADY DID, BABY.
YOU HAVE NAILED HIS ASS
ONTO THE WALL,
RIGHT HERE
IN BLACK AND WHITE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING.
I SPILLED MY GUTS OUT.
ALL ABOUT YOUR PHONY
"BACK TO AFRICA" SWINDLE.
NAMES, DATES, PLACES.
THE WAY YOU WERE GONNA
HIT ALL THE BIG CITIES
AND GET THE MONEY AND SPLIT.
IRIS
-- HOW YOU SET UP THE SWITCH AT THE RALLY,
WITH THE CAT SUPPOSED TO BE
FROM THE D.A.'s OFFICE.
THE WAY THEY WERE GONNA PRETEND
TO TAKE YOU AND THE MONEY DOWNTOWN.
BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED,
AND JOHN HILL GOT WASTED.
AND MABEL HILL FOUND OUT AND
WAS GOING STRAIGHT TO THE COPS.
AND YOU FOUND HER AND TRIED
TO KILL HER. THAT'S A LIE.
I WAS THERE!
I SAW YOU, YOU BASTARD!
YOU TOOK THAT SHIP, THAT BIG,
OLD BLACK SHIP BLACK BEAUTY,
AND YOU SMASHED IT DOWN
ON THAT POOR GIRL'S HEAD.
I NEVER TOUCHED THAT BOAT!
FRACTURED SKULL.
PROGNOSIS: NEGATIVE.
ASSAULT WITH
INTENT TO KILL.
IF SHE DIES, IT'S MURDER ONE.
WHICH MEANS
WE BURN YOU.
BURN ME?
BURN ME WITH WHAT?
LIEUTENANT!
I HOPE THAT SOME
OF YOU DAMN FOOLS
HAD THE GOOD SENSE TO EXAMINE
THAT MODEL BOAT FOR FINGERPRINTS.
OF COURSE WE DID, REVEREND.
TELL THESE TWO DUMB-ASS UNCLE
TOM NIGGER COPS OF YOURS
WHOSE PRINTS YOU FOUND ON THAT BOAT
-- THAT BROAD'S OR MINE?
HE DID IT! HE TOOK THOSE
PEOPLE'S MONEY. HE DID IT!
YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
I'LL GET YOU, O'MALLEY!
I SWEAR ON MY MOTHER'S GRAVE
I'LL GET YOU FOR THIS!
I SWEAR I WILL!
I'LL GET YOU!
[DOOR SLAMS]
ONE MORE WORD,
SOUL BROTHER.
YOU HAD IT MADE.
BLACK FOLKS WOULD HAVE
FOLLOWED YOU ANYWHERE.
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN
ANOTHER MARCUS GARVEY
OR EVEN ANOTHER
MALCOLM X.
BUT INSTEAD,
YOU AIN'T NOTHIN'
BUT A PIMP WITH
A CHICKENSHIT BACKBONE.
BREAK HIS GODDAMN HEAD.
NO.
KEEP HIM ON ICE
FOR 24 HOURS.
THEN HE'LL BUST HIS OWN HEAD.
24 HOURS?
BRYCE'LL NEVER
STAND FOR IT.
THE HELL WITH BRYCE!
O'MALLEY'LL BREAK.
NOT ONLY FOR US.
EVERYBODY IN HARLEM
WILL KNOW THE SON OF A BITCH
FOR THE EVIL BASTARD
THAT HE IS.
YOU HOLD HIM
ONE MORE DAY.
DON'T YOU GUYS EVER
LISTEN TO THE BUZZER?
WHAT'S UP?
THE WORD JUST CAME
OVER THE SQUAWK BOX.
THEY JUST FOUND UNCLE BUDD.
DID THEY FIND
A BALE OF COTTON?
DON'T ASK ME.

OH, MY GOD.

BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

OF GIFT-BRINGING,
BUT TO OFFER PRAYERS

I KNOW HOW TO USE THIS THING,

WHERE THE HELL

WELL, AIN'T THIS
THE GOING-BACK-TO-AFRICA RALLY?
NO, BROTHER. IT IS
THE GOING-HOME RALLY.
NOW MOVE IT.
SERGEANT,
MY NAME IS CALLAHAN.
I'M THE ATTORNEY
FOR REVEREND O'MALLEY.
I HAVE A WRIT
FOR HIS RELEASE,
SIGNED BY JUDGE
GLOSSNER.
THIS'LL TAKE
A FEW MINUTES.
OK. I'LL GO DOWN
AND TELL HIM.
I THANK ALL OF YOU.
I'M OBLIGED TO YOU
FOR COMING DOWN HERE
AND BRINGING THIS GREAT FOOD
FOR ME AND MY FELLOW PRISONERS.
AMEN.
AMEN.
INASMUCH AS YOU'VE DONE UNTO
ONE OF THESE, MY LITTLE ONES,
YOU'VE DONE UNTO ME.
AMEN.
AMEN.
Minister: JUST THE WAY
YOU WANTED IT.
O'Malley: PRAISE THE LORD,
BROTHER, AMEN.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR TRAY,
SISTER MINNIE?
IT'S ALL YOURS,
REVEREND.
I THANK YOU, SISTER,
BUT I'D BE MUCH OBLIGED
IF YOU'D TAKE THAT TRAY OVER
TO SISTER IRIS OVER THERE.
WELL, IF YOU SAY SO,
REVEREND.
I DO SAY SO, SISTER.
AND, SISTER MINNIE,
THE LORD LOVETH
A CHEERFUL GIVER.
AMEN.
AMEN.
AMEN.
A JEALOUS HYSTERICAL WOMAN...
WILL DO ANYTHING, INCLUDING
LIE, TO HURT O'MALLEY.
IS THAT THE CASE?
NO. THERE'S A BALE
OF COTTON,
THE WHITE MAN
THAT DIGGER SPOTTED,
THE SHOOT-OUT,
AND THE VICIOUS MURDER
OF BOOKER
WASHINGTON SIMMS.
WHO?
UNCLE BUDD, THE OLD
JUNK DEALER.
WE'RE STILL DRAGGING
THE RIVER FOR HIS BODY.
AND ALL ED AND DIGGER
WANT TO DO
IS HOLD O'MALLEY
FOR ONE MORE DAY.
WHAT?
THEY THINK
THAT THEY CAN--
DON'T TELL ME WHAT THEY THINK.
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.
OR DON'T YOU
DO THAT ANYMORE?
WE COULD HOLD HIM
ON A TECHNICALITY
FOR 24 HOURS,
IT BEING SUNDAY.
JONES!
JOHNSON!
DID I OR LIEUTENANT ANDERSON
OR ANYBODY ELSE
AUTHORIZE YOU
TO OFFER THOSE PEOPLE MONEY
OUT THERE THIS AFTERNOON?
NO, SIR.
GOOD. THEN YOU RECOGNIZE
THAT THE PRECINCT
IS IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOUR FOOLISH STATEMENTS
OR ANYTHING ELSE.
IT WAS GETTING A LITTLE
HAIRY OUT THERE.
IT WAS A FLAGRANT BREACH
OF POLICE PROCEDURE.
I WON'T HAVE IT.
THAT ALL, SIR?
THAT IS NOT ALL!
IN SPITE OF THE FACT
THAT WE CAME WITHIN ONE INCH
OF A RIOT OUT THERE
THIS AFTERNOON
AND WE HAVE NO PROOF WHATSOEVER
AGAINST REVEREND O'MALLEY,
ANDERSON TELLS ME YOU WANT ME
TO HOLD HIM ANOTHER DAY.
THAT'S RIGHT, SIR.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MINDS,
BOTH OF YOU.
DO YOU HAVE TO PLAY
WITH THAT THING?
I'M INSECURE, CAPTAIN.
BUT THE QUESTION
STILL IS,
CAN WE HOLD HIM
ANOTHER DAY?
I'M NOT FINISHED.
YOU'VE ALLOWED
YOUR PERSONAL PREJUDICE
TO GET IN THE WAY
OF YOUR JUDGMENT.
YOU'VE BUNGLED
THIS WHOLE THING
FROM BEGINNING TO END.
AND YOU AND YOUR PARTNER
HAVE TURNED THIS ENTIRE
INVESTIGATION
INTO A PERSONAL VENDETTA
AGAINST REVEREND O'MALLEY.
VENDETTA?
VENDETTA!
O'MALLEY'S A ROTTEN,
THIEVING, LYING--
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT HE IS.
IT'S NO CONCERN
OF YOURS ANYMORE.
I'M TAKING YOU OFF THE CASE.
THANK YOU, SIR.
WHAT?
YOU WANT US OFF THE CASE?
YOU GOT US OFF.
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT NOW I'M REALLY WORRIED.
Woman: WHERE IS DEKE?
Second woman:
THERE HE IS.
NO PICTURES, NO PICTURES.
REVEREND O'MALLEY.
YES, SIR.
COULD WE HAVE ONE WORD
WITH YOU IN PRIVATE?
ONE WORD IN PRIVATE.
WE UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR A WHITE MAN
AND A BALE OF COTTON.
WE GOT 'EM BOTH.
UH, CALLAHAN,
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?
SISTER MINNIE.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
WELL, THERE GOES THAT
$87,000 PROMISE YOU MADE.
WEMADE, OLD BUDDY.
WEMADE.
YEAH,WEMADE.
THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE
MAKING OUT AN I.O.U.,
INCLUDE ME OUT, HUH?
WHAT WE NEED IS SOME
NEW BAIT FOR THAT TRAP.
A WHOLE NEW KIND OF FOX.
LOOK, MAN,
I'M NOT IN ANY MOOD
FOR ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR
GODDAMN COLORED FAIRY TALES.
A STONE FOX.
SOMEBODY
WHO WANTS O'MALLEY
WORSE THAN WE DO.
HEY, LADY.
WHERE'S MY PASTOR?!
WHERE'S MY PASTOR?!
NOW, HOLD ON, NOW.
WHAT DID YOU--WHAT DID YOU
DO WITH MY PASTOR?
WAIT A MINUTE. HOLD IT.
JUST A MINUTE, NOW.
HOW THE HELL DID YOU
GET IN HERE?
SHE'S WITH THE DELEGATION.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?
IF Y'ALL DON'T GIVE ME
BACK MY PASTOR,
I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU IN
THE STOMACH WITH THIS UMBRELLA.
NOW, WATCH IT, LADY.
O'MALLEY AIN'T HERE.
HE'S BEEN RELEASED.
GIVE ME BACK MY PASTOR.
O'MALLEY AIN'T HERE,
I TELL YOU,
AND IF YOU DON'T GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE
WITH ALL THAT NOISE,
I'M GONNA JAIL YOU.
AND STAY OUT.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH THAT OLD BAG?
MY PEOPLE.
MY PEOPLE.
IRIS!
DON'T "IRIS" ME, YOU
HONEY-DRIPPING BASTARD!
LET GO OF ME!
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF HER.
COOL IT, BABY.
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF OF ME.
TIE HER UP.
NOBODY TWO-TIMES IRIS
AND GETS AWAY WITH IT.
TIE HER UP,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.
LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT
THE ONLY ONE
OUR PREACHER FRIEND'S
CROSSED.
WHAT THE--
WHAT'D HE DO TO YOU?
NONE OF YOUR
GODDAMN BUSINESS.
CUT ME LOOSE, CALHOUN.
HAND OVER THE MONEY,
I'LL CUT YOU LOOSE.
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE
TO TELL YOU, YOU IDIOT?
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE IT'S AT.
MM-HMM.
WHAT ABOUT IRIS?
SHE DON'T KNOW,
EITHER.
LOOK, MAN,
QUIT PLAYING GAMES.
HMM?
CUT ME LOOSE.
PARTNER!
CAL, I SET THE WHOLE
THING UP FOR YOU.
YOU WERE NOTHING
BUT A DUMB CONVICT
IN ROW "C"
TILL I PUT YOU WISE.
YEAH, YOU SET IT UP
FOR ME, BASTARD!
YOU SET IT UP FOR ME
TO BE THE PATSY
AND YOU TO TAKE
THE MONEY AND RUN!
I WOULDN'T CROSS YOU.
CAL, WE'RE PARTNERS.
WHAT ABOUT THAT LITTLE
OLD SWITCH WITH THE D.A.'s MEN?
THAT WAS JUST IN CASE
YOU DIDN'T ARRIVE
WITH THE MEAT WAGON
IN TIME.
AND HOW ABOUT THAT LITTLE
OLD SHOOT-OUT IN THE JUNKYARD?
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE COPS.
I SWEAR IT.
CAL, CUT ME LOOSE,
AND WE'LL GO
AND FIND THE MONEY
AND SPLIT IT!
CON MAN
TO THE BITTER END.
I OUGHT TO SHOOT YOU
RIGHT BETWEEN YOUR BLACK EYES
FOR WHAT YOU DONE TO ME,
BUT I'M GONNA BE
BIG ABOUT IT.
YEAH. I'M GONNA LET YOU
BUY YOUR LIFE BACK,
AND ALL IT'S
GONNA COST YOU
IS ALL THAT 87 GRAND
STASHED IN THAT BALE
OF COTTON.
COTTON?
IS THAT
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?
YEAH.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
YEAH, I KNOW
WHERE IT'S AT.
ALL RIGHT...
TALK.
WHAT'S IN IT
FOR ME?
IRIS.
YOU SHUT UP.
YOU TALK,
OR I'LL BLOW
YOUR BRAINS OUT.
HMMPH. YEAH, THAT'LL
GET YOU EXACTLY NOWHERE.
WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO
IS, UH...
BLOW THAT MOTHER'S
BRAINS OUT.
WHAT?
BLOW THAT TWO-TIMING
MOTHER'S BRAINS OUT.
THEN I'LL SHOW YOU
WHERE THE BALE OF COTTON IS.
YOU DO IT.
YOU UNTIE ME, AND I WILL.
UNTIE HER.
[DOOR CLOSES]
WHO FOLLOWED YOU
HERE?
HOW IN THE HELL
I KNOW?
IRIS, SWEETHEART,
BABY, YOU FOUND IT.
YOU FOUND THAT
BALE OF COTTON.
HERE, COME ON.
UNTIE THESE ROPES, HONEY.
COME ON, IRIS.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
COME ON, HONEY.
CUT THESE ROPES,
AND LET'S GET OUT--
UHH!
HA HA! HA, IRIS!
IRIS!
OK, BABY.
NO, IRIS,
I DON'T BLAME YOU.
GO AHEAD.
DO YOUR THING.
BUT BEFORE
YOU KILL ME,
WOULD YOU
DO ME A FAVOR?
DON'T BEG ME, DEKE.
I AIN'T BEGGIN'.
BUT WOULD YOU MIND
REACHING YOUR HAND DOWN
INTO MY POCKET
AND TAKING OUT THAT
LITTLE OLD PACKAGE?
GO AHEAD, IRIS.
THAT'S IT, BABY.
GO AHEAD.
BAT?
BILLIE BOY?
HALT!
GOD DAMN IT!
ANOTHER FINE MESS
YOU GOT US INTO.
I GOT US INTO?
SHUT UP AND SHOOT.
HIT IT AGAIN.
WHERE ARE THEY, IRIS?
IRIS!
NOW, WHERE ARE THEY?
I'M TALKIN' TO YOU!
NOW, WHERE ARE THEY?
ALL RIGHT, IRIS.
WHERE'S THE DOOR?
HEY, BABY,
LET'S MOVE IT.
I'M GONNA GET OUT
AN APB.
I'M GONNA FIND THOSE TWO
IF IT TAKES EVERY COP
IN THIS PRECINCT.
LET ME TRY, SIR.

THEIR HANGOUTS AND ALL.

WELL, THEN,

BACK HERE TILL YOU DO.

DON'T TURN YOUR BACKS--
[CLANG]
JAREMA, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?
OH!
IT'S EMPTY, LUDDY.
WHAT'S EMPTY?
DAMN COTTON BALE
IS EMPTY.
HA!
WHERE ARE THEY?
WHERE THE HELL ARE THOSE
2 COPS WHO WAS HERE?
WHAT, YOU MEAN
COFFIN ED AND GRAVE DIGGER?
YEAH.
OH, MAN.
THEY'VE BEEN GONE.
[LAUGHING]
WHAT THE HELL FOR?
YOUR WHOLE OPERATION
IS SITTIN'
ON A BLACK VOLCANO, MAN.
RIGHT, CASPAR?
UH, I'M AFRAID
HE'S RIGHT, TOM.
YOU SEE, TOM, THINGS
HAVE CHANGED UP HERE.
BLACK PEOPLE
ARE THINKING ABOUT
TAKING OVER
WHITE BUSINESSES.
RIGHT, CASPAR?
RIGHT. I WAS JUST
READING AN ARTICLE
ON BLACK CAPITALISM.
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND THERE AIN'T
NO CAPITALISM
BIGGER THAN YOURS
IN HARLEM.
RIGHT, CASPAR?
RIGHT.
NOW, THE WAY I SEE THINGS
IS, UH, IS ORGANIZATION.
UH, AND NOT ONLY NEW BLOOD,
BUT BLACK BLOOD,
IMPROVIN' THE OPERATION
AROUND HERE.
UH, SEEMS TO ME THAT
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY
UH, IN JUST BEING BLACK
THESE DAYS.
SO THERE'S GOT
TO BE SOME WAY.
HMM?
SIT DOWN.
HOW MUCH IS IT GONNA COST ME
TO STOP THIS KIND OF TALK?
[LAUGHS]
WELL,
THAT BALE WAS EMPTY.
THAT MONEY MUST HAVE
BEEN PLANTED IN THERE.
PLANTED?
BY WHO, YOU IDIOT?
JONES AND JOHNSON?
WELL, I STILL SAY THE--
THE BALE WAS EMPTY.
WELL, IT SURE
AIN'T EMPTY NOW.
LIEUTENANT, I THINK
YOU BETTER COUNT IT.
DON'T YOU?
MM-HMM.
OH,
I BET IT'S ALL HERE.
WELL, PERHAPS
SERGEANT JAREMA
OUGHT TO
COUNT IT HIMSELF.
YOU TRICKED ME.
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TWO
BLACK BASTARDS DID IT,
BUT YOU TRICKED ME.
JAREMA,
I WANT YOU TO APOLOGIZE
TO THESE TWO OFFICERS
FOR THAT RACIAL SLUR,
OR I'LL HAVE YOUR BADGE.
AW, I APOLOGIZE,
BUT...
BUT...
YOU'LL, UH, HAVE TO
OVERLOOK JAREMA.
HE'S...HAD A BAD DAY.
HAVEN'T WE ALL?
MAY WE GO, CAPTAIN?
MAY YOU--
OF COURSE.
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU, SIR.
ED, DIGGER.
TELL ME SOMETHING,
WILL YA?
WHAT'S A BALE OF COTTON
DOING IN HARLEM?
"DEAR GRAVE DIGGER JONES
AND COFFIN ED JOHNSON..."
Uncle Budd: IF YOU'RE
STILL DRAGGING THE RIVER
LOOKING FOR THE BODY
OF OLD UNCLE BUDD
AND THE 87,000,
STOP.
I AM NOW
A RETIRED GENTLEMAN
RAISING COTTON ON MY VILLA
IN AFRICA.
IF YOU ARE EVER
IN THIS NECK OF THE WOODS,
PLEASE DROP IN AND SEE ME.
"YOURS TRULY,
BOOKER WASHINGTON SIMMS."
HA HA HA!
BETTER KNOWN
AS OLD UNCLE BUDD.
HA HA HA HA!
You are seven years old.
You are a man.
Bury your first toy and your mother's picture.
The mole digs tunnels under the earth, looking for the sun.
Sometimes, he gets to the surface.
When he sees the sun, he is blinded.
Kill me! Kill me, please!
Who did this?
Kill me, please!
Who?
Who?
- It was the Colonel.
- How many were there?
Another five men.
Where?
At the Franciscan Mission.
The Colonel is not selfish.
He uses women once, and then gives them to us.
The Colonel said he'd kill whoever touched me.
Who asked for them?
Do not anticipate my wishes.
Forgive us!
They have no soul.
But sometimes they get bored, so I hand them the leftovers.
Ask, dogs. Ask!
Stay put, dogs.
Kiss them on the mouth.
Go on, kiss the other one.
Stay put, dogs!
These animals like to watch.
They want to look at your breasts.
Eat, dogs!
Who are you to judge me?
I am God!
No, not that! Anything, but that!
Lay him down on the ground.
Destroy me. Depend on no one.
Cry, boy, cry!
Cry so he'll have mercy.
It's bitter.
Moses found water in the desert.
But people couldn't drink it, for it was bitter.
They called the water "Mara".
It's become sweet.
I'll call you Mara, for you are like bitter water.
How are we to live here?
We'll die of thirst.
As a hind longs for the running streams, so do I long for thee, oh God.
With my soul,
I thirst for God, the living God.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
- Do you love me?
- Yes.
I don't. So that I may love you, you have to be the best.
Four great gun masters live in this desert.
You've got to look for them, and kill them.
The desert is a circle.
To find them, we'd have to travel in a spiral.
I can't go on! Let's go back!
Whenever I start something,
I finish it.
We'll never find them.
If they are real masters, they will give us a signal.
We have been walking for days, months, years.
How can you have such faith?
They await us.
The signal!
You seek the light in the middle of the day.
I know what you came for.
You'll have to wait to see him.
Just like that woman.
The master doesn't want to fight her.
The great master wants to see you right now.
It's strange.
He's always kept them waiting.
After the dune, there's an oasis.
Your woman must wait there.
Let's go!
Give me your gun and hat.
I need no light. I am blind.
Count to three and try to grab it.
One, two, three...
How?
I try not to win, but to achieve the perfect domain.
So as not to fear the bullets.
Shoot!
I bleed little now.
I offer no resistance to the bullets.
I let them pass through the empty spots of my flesh.
Do you still want to fight me?
Yes.
I don't fear killing you because there is no death.
I'll let you fire first.
- He's greater than I am.
- You'll win.
Even though I'd win, I'd lose.
I want a winner. Find out how.
Don't fight honestly.
Make up something. Cheat him.
There's always a way to win.
Find a way.
I told you so. I said you could win.
I am proud of you.
You have three more masters left.
I know where the second one lives.
If you let me come,
I could take you there.
It's here.
Wait.
We were waiting for you.
This is what the cards foretell.
You are falling. You keep falling.
The deeper you fall, the higher you'll get.
Coward, murderer!
The Lord's will is unexplainable.
My son and I must respect you.
You may fight him.
Come closer.
The duel begins this moment.
You may shoot when you desire.
Dead.
Technically, you're dead.
I now wish to speak to the dead one.
Follow me.
I began making copper objects.
And thus strengthened my fingers.
I now make delicate things.
I am so strong now that I can play with this object, without breaking it.
Shoot!
A very delicate shot.
It destroys the precise.
You shoot to find yourself,
I do it in order to vanish.
Perfection is to get lost.
In order to get lost, you have to love.
You don't love. You destroy, you kill, and no one loves you.
For when you think you are giving, you are really taking away.
I have given myself to her.
I gave her all.
She's within me.
Her immense love fills me.
What I do and say, is dictated and sanctified by her.
I hate anything that is mine, for it turns me away from her divine presence.
Two are better than one.
For if one fell, the second would help him.
But pity the lonely one, with no one to help him.
When I did it,
I didn't think it would be any good.
I only tried to do it the best I could.
Take your gun again.
My son wishes to give you one last chance.
PROPHETS
Don't get near him.
Why do you follow us? Get lost!
There was no need to draw your gun.
I do not distrust you.
You have a flute.
We'll know each other by music.
You loath yourself.
You don't wish to play tricks anymore.
You now want to respect the law.
Some give flowers, others give valuable things.
You bring me your own life.
You don't fear death anymore.
That's why you are a dangerous foe.
When you were seven yards from the corral, my rabbits began to die.
Almost all of them are dead.
Now that you are here, not one of them will live.
I made it myself!
See its fineness!
I'll take just one shot.
That's all I need.
One bullet, always deadly.
Shoot.
Can you tell which one you shot?
This one is yours.
It's been hit in the head.
This one is mine.
It's been hit in the heart.
The heart, and the head.
Swap them.
It's time.
Too much perfection is a mistake.
You won!
Don't leave me! You will be the best.
I'll help you. There's only one left.
You want to fight me?
How will you do it?
I haven't got a gun anymore.
I traded the gun for a butterfly net.
You'll have to fight with your fists.
Strike! Strike! Strike!
You see, my net is mightier than your bullets.
If you shoot again, it will go back into your heart.
How could you win?
For I don't fight, I have nothing.
Even though you cheated, you couldn't have taken anything.
Yes, I could have taken your life.
Life! I don't care about that.
I'll show you.
You lost.
You won! You are the best.
I have been spilt like water, and my bones have been dislocated.
My heart has turned to wax and melts within me.
And my tongue sticks to my jaw.
I am laid low in the dust of death.
My God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Why are You so far from saving me, from heeding my groans?
Oh, my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou dost not answer.
In the night I cry, but I get no respite.
It's either him or me?
Make thy paths known from me.
Oh, Lord, teach me thy ways.
Lead me in thy truth and teach me.
Thou art God, my savior.
I have waited all day long for thee.
You'll show the sinners the way.
You'll lead us through final judgment.
PSALMS
I am not a God.
I am a man.
How long have I been here?
When you got here,
I hadn't yet been born.
I've looked after you since I was a child.
The old woman says that you'll free us. Come!
We've been prisoners here for many years.
That hole is the only way out.
You have to climb for a few days to get to it.
Outside, down the mountain, there's a town.
They won't help us to get out.
We are deformed, due to the continuous incest.
We are repulsive to them.
It must be hard to bring me here.
Why did you do it?
The old lady knows.
She sent for you.
She wants to see you now.
This is not me! This is not my face.
I'll get money and I'll dig a tunnel.
The tunnel will join the town with this cave.
When I finish it, you'll be free at last.
You'll get out of here!
So, that's the great town!
We'll have to beg.
Fix the curls.
Fix my nails!
Cream!
A fan!
This degenerate is looking at my legs!
Help, he's embracing me!
You are witnesses!
He's kissed me by force!
Filthy slave! How dare you!
Help, he's raping me!
Stop him! Murderer!
Stop him! Don't let him get away!
Rapist! He's a degenerate!
Murderer, murderer!
Do you think it's worth it for my people to come here?
This is worse.
I'll keep on digging.
How many meters have we dug?
I dig!
We've lost our audience!
Hey, you monsters! Come here!
We'll pay you a good fee.
Both are dead.
- Who died first?
- This one.
This one is the champion.
You protect us, oh Lord!
You protect us, oh Lord!
God loves us and protects us!
If we have faith, nothing will happen to us.
We must play with our Lord.
Death is our bet.
And let the one who doesn't have faith, die.
A miracle!
A miracle!
A miracle!
Fear not, it's a blank.
The weapon. It's a miracle!
A miracle!
APOCALYPSE
No one will come anymore.
The circus is over.
I'll go also.
Come in, come in!
As always, the Decent Women League, after it's monthly inspection, greets their husbands.
Everything in here is decent.
Do you want to make some money?
Come, come!
Go down!
Come in!
Do your kissing stunt.
We now want to see the rest.
Undress! The wedding night!
I love you. They do not exist.
There's nobody, but you.
We're alone. Take me, please.
We'll be able to buy dynamite to keep digging the tunnel.
Hey, why are you hiding?
I am ashamed.
You must be disgusted by me.
You are going to leave me.
No, come with me.
Tell him to marry us.
Go!
We are going to get married, Father.
You can't kill him.
He's doing great things.
He promised he'd dig the tunnel, so they would be free.
I'll wait until you finish the job.
Then I will kill you.
But I'll be watching you, so you don't escape.
We'll never finish it.
It takes too much time.
If you want us to go faster, help us to dig.
And if you want to finish sooner, help us to beg.
It's hard rock.
We've tried it a thousand times and we can't do it.
Just a thousand times?
Your pain must be unbearable.
This body feels the pain, not me.
You'll never do it. Stop it!
We've made it! We've made it!
Do not tell them yet.
They are still unprepared.
I cannot kill my master.
Subtitles by
International Broadcast Facilities
There, that's good.
Luckily we've got ace photographer
Angus Snapforth to do our credits.
He works longitudinally... developing his negatives in Turkish-bath cabinet.
So this should be just the job for him.
And he has promised to make it snappy.
37 miles to the north, a bit east, and then up a bit lies Pinchcliff.
A village perched under the blue welkin... with it's own steam-driven cheese factory, a camping site, a local paper... and it's own TV station.
Open to all the winds that blow, where the sun rises above Lonetree Hill... lives our cycle-repairer,
Theodore Rimspoke.
Must be awkward for a wretched cyclist with a blow-out... to have to wheel his mount all this way to get our expert to fix it.
Doesn't look as if business is very thriving, does it?
It's only our postman, old foot-slogging
Dan Hoofer, who makes his way there... with the local rag and outstanding bills. His greatcoat has diamond tread.
He's colour blind and has been run over a couple of times... walks with a list to port and plays the big bass on festive occasions.
Not much more to sa y about Hoofer.
Cycle-repairer Rimspoke is an independent sort of bloke.
More of an inventor than a businessman.
Famous for his ingenious designs... such as pedal-activated combined shaving and raspberry-picking machine.
He uses a copying pencil, instant coffee and his own patent telescopic ruler.
Sonny Duckworth is the early bird personified.
Hatched out in a weeping willow. A born optimist...
- with muffler, felt slippers and indifferent morals. As Sonny puts it:
The early worm gets the bird.
Difficulties he treats as trifles, the impossible as a challenge.
He's Rimspoke's right-hand man, counsellor, and friend.
Lambert is a night-owl with ha y-fever, a pillar of the rustic establishment.
Run over by a reaper and got a crew-cut, short back, bushy by the ears.
Found under the roots of a knotted oak and included as a Rimspoke resident.
Lambert is a personal pessimist, and only really at home in Darkest Devon.
And this is their home, standing in its own pleasant grounds... enjoying all the benefits of
Rimspoke's ingenious gadgets.
Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
Hi, Theodore! Look at this.
This morning's post.
Nothing but bills. Put them on the window sill with the others.
Take a look at that super car!
Look at that there Rudolph Gore-Slimey!
- Do you know that fellow?
- Know him?
- Yes, I'll say I know him.
- Do you know him personal?
That there Rudolph, he was a kind of apprentice to me in my workshop.
Then he suddenly packed it in and went to town.
And now he's in big business, and a racing driver, I see.
You don't sa y...? Big business, too?
Beats me how that there Gore-Slimey... got into the racing circuit?
Competing with the best in the world, it says.
Look! Smashing picture on the back too.
Well, I never...!
I might have guessed as much.
Guessed? Guessed what?
I wonder what he's got under his bonnet?
So that's why Gore-Slimey was in such a hurry to go to town, huh?
There's some skulduggery going on here.
- More trouble brewing, I'll wager...
- No, no, Lambert.
Say, Theodore, what's skulduggery?
Yeh, what's skulduggery?
Well, we better get down to some honest work.
Out with you, and set to work!
When the call to work goes out,
Brother, please include me out!
Put your hat and coat on, Lambert!
Come on!
I see, doing your daily dozen, Lambert?
I say, what's skulduggery, Sonny?
Skulduggery?
That is skulduggery!
Oh.
The north wind's blowing from every quarter today, Sonny?
Lovely weather for working.
I'm scared, I am.
I don't like it when it's blowing from every quarter.
- Let's get this contraption working!
- All, right, just leave it to me.
Computerised production of flagpoles for the Swiss Navy!
That'll be 10, 75.
Theodore is self-supporting, has his own electric power, water laid on... and turns an honest penny on the side.
Lambert remains a true romantic.
Despite his chronic hay fever
Lambert is conspicuously on parade... whenever the sun shines down at Pinchcliffe.
You'd hardly say life at Rimspoke's is one mad rush, but now and again... a buckled wheel or a bent handlebar needs attention.
The profits are hardly likely to cause repercussions on the money market... still the three of them up the hill are content enough.
Don't be frightened, Lambert.
I'll switch the TV on, Theodore.
- I don't like TV.
- There's no bogeyman in the box.
You never can tell, can you.
And now for the news, read by
pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank.
This is usually pretty exciting.
The situation is still
very tense in the Middle East.
Here...
- Dang me sideways!
- I'm scared, I am, Theodore.
And now after the news,
the World of Sport.
We deserve a little extra treat tonight.
I expect you'd like some dewrinkled raisins, Sonny?
Help yourself, there's plenty for everyone.
The current Motor Racing
sensation, Rudolph Gore-Slimey.
After winning his third successive
Grand Prix. A few words, please.
I came of humble stock from
the little village of Pinchcliffe.
Worked for a while in a cycle repair
shop run by an eccentric rustic.
Forget his name... Theodore...
Theodore Rimspoke, I think it was.
- Just hark at him... I mean to sa y...
- Quiet now, Sonny!
Humble beginnings, eh?
Funny to think how easy it can be
to get stuck in a rut like that place.
But there was no stopping you?
No, and I think my latest invention
will revolutionise motor racing!
- What invention?
- This super retometric distributor.
It raises the jet-injection factor to
1000 and the corradial effect by 112%.
So that's your game! So that's your invention, is it, Rudolph?
Funny, because here's the working drawing!
What did you sa y? Has Gore-Slimey gone and swiped your invention?
Yes, he must have collared it when he was working here as my assistant.
Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop. I never heard the like!
I sa y, please, could you pass me another liquorice allsorts?
Hush! We must listen to what Gore-Slimey has to sa y.
Let me repeat, I'm prepared anytime,
anywhere, to meet any challenge.
Thank you for talking to us.
We hope we shall soon see
someone putting up a challenge.
Now the Chairman, District Veterinary
Surgeon Roger Uddersfield...
will present today's commercials.
For guaranteed social success, use
Brough, the swift-action hair tonic.
- Switch off that commercial nonsense!
- Remember the name, Brough!
Recommended by egg-heads!
- Don't let them fool you, Theodore!
- Well, what's a bloke to do now?
You're going to challenge!
No, no, that'd be dangerous.
- You pipe down, Lambert!
- Challenge him?
I do have a little secret tucked away in the coach-house. Might be fun...
Have a go! Could you get this completed, Gore-Slimey wouldn't need... any driving-mirror!
Just imagine II Tempo Gigante!
Rimspoke's reply to the Italian Ferrari!
- Out of the way, macadamised snail!
- Save your felt-slippers, Sonny.
Well, shall we take a peep inside the coach-house and see what we've got?
- Yes, let's!
- Oh, no.
There isn't much I can do with this thing here.
It's in a sorrier state than I suspected.
- You could soon fix this up.
- Can't build a car without a penny.
I haven't even got the nuts and bolts.
We'll have to make a real killing!
You could raise the wind, could you?
A divinity shapes our ends.
Stick'em up!
- Hand it over!
- Do you suppose I've got any money?
This bloke's a poor as a church mouse!
- This won't solve our problems.
- Well, blow me. I'll be...
Well, blow me. I'll be...
That really hurt.
Never felt such a pain before.
Wouldn't never ever have thought it possible.
- Move over!
- Can't I have the inside berth tonight?
- Don't we all have our places?
- I never get the inside berth.
- There's such a draft off the floor.
- That's why I take the inside berth.
Come on, pipe down!
Well, good night to you, Sonny.
Sleep well.
Nighty!
Sonny!
Sonny!
I sa y, Theodore? Has he gone out?
I wonder why?
Theodore's feeling a bit down in the dumps.
I wonder if it is because he hasn't got enough money to build the car, Sonny?
Think you'll be able to help him out, eh, Sonny?
Lambert, it's only a matter of time... before Sonny Duckworth of Sludgemere strikes again!
I think I'll just stretch my carcase a bit more.
Oi! String me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
Rolls-Royce 1905 model! Solid gold.
Acetylene lamps.
Gosh, transverse interleaved suspension. Silicon finish...
What sort of a spooky get-up is that?
He must be oozing with dough!
Gosh! He's using dollar bills as fly-whisks!
"Aladdin Oil"!
He must be one of those oil sheiks!
Perhaps we could funnel a little in Theodore's direction...
Snickety snoo!
How too, too snickety snoo.
If this isn't tempting providence,
I'd like to know what is.
An ape, honestly. A genuine cross between a chimp and a gorilla.
This is no joking matter!
There should be plenty of money here for Theodore's new design.
Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
Talk about an Oriental chick!
And that fierce-looking money-grubber!
Desperados!
What eez the bizniz going on here?
And the papyrus here?
Theez eez no hieroglyphics.
Theeze eez drawing of fast motor-car.
Sensation!
Theez car work of great genius.
Where is the deesigner?
Ali, ali, Emanuel Desperados, you fetch me theez genius!
Thrown out? Not possibull!
Throw out of the tent of
Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza?
Idiot!
You stupid gorilla dam blockhead.
Sonny's not the type to give up easily!
At a pinch he gets his fertile brain... work overtime and changes his line of attack.
Once his mind's made up, there's no stopping Sonny.
Ah, yes, the Pinchcliffe Gazette.
That's an idea all right.
An ad inserted here will have world wide coverage!
My Spanish gambit eez successful!
And it's Desperados to move.
Your check easy to overcome.
I just go through weez my castle.
That shake you, eh?
You theenk you vairy smart, no?
I just move my keeng...
And you get nowhere.
Jallah.
Sheikh Bonanza checkmated?
You...!
I no time to play theez silly game with stoopid ape. I prefer study drawing.
Emanuel Desperados.
Zees car ingenious!
You!
Throw designer out of my tent. Idiot!
You beeg blockhead!
Stoopid gorilla...
So you're up early for once, Lambert?
Yeh, gotta spend a penny.
- Perhaps you could fetch the paper?
- Yeh, I'll do that for you.
Ladies and gentlemen, we
have a sensational announcement...
of the new racing car now under
construction by Theodore Rimspoke.
Pinchcliffe radio and
Television roving reporter...
pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank,
has all the details.
Your on the air, Archie!
It's all yours!
- You're on the air.
- Thank you.
My, you people are inquisitive!
We have it on the best of authority...
that cycle-repairer
Theodore Rimspoke...
resident of Pinchcliffe, plans to
complete his II Tempo Gigante.
Aha! There's the sooper-dooper car.
What an advertisement for Aladdin Oil!
Me finance Rimspoke and we win race!
Emanuel Desperados, you drive me!
We go visit genius!
Emanuel, geev me completed contract!
And you, my little turtle dove, you come visit Big Chief Rimspoke.
Desperados, speed, queek, hurry!
Hurry, hurry!
You have trouble weez my Rolls-Royce?
My car guaranteed!
Hurry! Turn starting-handle!
Bravo!
Close zee door and get cracking!
Hurry! We late!
Now change gear!
Caramba!
Put her in reverse... there you idiot.
Snitchery snoo!
This is tempting providence putting all this in print.
Theodore, it says in the paper.
But where the dickens is it?
- Theodore, the paper!
- What does it say in the paper?
It's all about your car.
What? Let's have a look!
Well, what do you know!
II Tempo Gigante? It's our car!
How did that old picture get into print?
Speed it up!
Dangerous suspension bridge. Hurry!
Speed it up!
"Rimspoke has accepted
Gore-Slimey's challenge."
"Prospects for the
Race of the Century."
I wonder who's gone and...?
So, that's it. Sonny has been at work.
Yeh, Sonny has been at work.
- Who, me?
- Yes, you!
- What've you been up to now, Sonny?
- What've you been up to now, Sonny?
- Just a few casual acquaintances.
- Sonny's casual acquaintances, eh?
They're apt to be a bit suspect.
- I believe we've got something outside.
- Sounds like it.
Ze silence here is as profound as in ze desert. All people inside ze house.
Emanuel, go knock up ze door!
Would you open the door, Lambert?
Someone's lost his way and landed here.
Hurry along, Lambert, you like receiving visitors, I know.
Lambert, man, don't be scared just because the door creaks a bit.
Look at Sonny!
Cool as a prize cucumber.
- Give them a nice welcome, Lambert.
- Yes, I certainly will.
- Oh, gosh!
- Salaam, salaam!
May Allah protect thee and thy house.
I have journeyed from afar to have a good squint at Rimspoke.
Have no fear, friend! My chauffeur not dangerous, just a bit inquisitive.
Very, very inquisitive!
What sort of a jungle denizen might this be?
Must have been smuggled in in a crate of bananas.
You ze great bicycle-repairer Rimspoke?
Yes, that's supposed to be me.
Just step right inside.
Brew up a pot of coffee, Lambert.
Ah, you verry kind. We come to have pow-wow and you must listen to me.
You Rimspoke brilliant designer.
I Abdul Ben Bonanza have seen TV.
I will finance your Tempo Gigante.
I plenty moneys. You plenty broke.
Well, maybe, but what do you want me to do?
You use my oil and petrol.
Z e best in ze whole world.
She'll run on my own patent mixture.
It would be fun to give it a try.
Then pleez you sign theez contract.
No, no, that's dangerous.
- Do you think so, Lambert?
- Of course you'll sign, Theodore.
The offer of a century, from friends in distant lands!
- Yes, pleez sign!
- You're on dangerous ground.
Don't listen to that Jeremiah.
It's the chance of a lifetime.
Well, it might well be.
Bravo! So now pleez sign contract.
We're heading straight for disaster. I know it.
It's amazing what you can do with money!
And a string of oil wells to back you up.
Damn me if Theodore, the bird... and our ungainly furry friend with the rucksack haven't really go cracking!
Nuts and bolts, sprockets and spindles.
Skilled hands engaged in precision lathe-work... on rotary hydrogenic valves.
With one vigilant eye cocked on the doings of willing helpers... who run unnecessary risks without the protection of safety footwear.
Work proceeds da y and night.
Mysterious fluids seethe and bubble in carboys, copper tubes and on hotplates.
Theodore is experimenting with all kinds of fuel... and hand-made thinly rolled body panels.
Behind dark goggles Theodore is concocting a motorised carriage... that is going to prove a sensation in the motor-racing world... with technical finesses which entail radical innovations in the carburetion!
Straight down the lightning conductor!
Theodore has taken proper precautions... against natural catastrophes and unforeseen punctures.
Il Tempo Gigante features special tyres, with steel reinforcement.
And seven layers of chicken netting welded into West Indian rubber alloys.
When Theodore builds an engine, he doesn't settle for a mere two-stroke.
He has drilled 12 cylinders and fitted them with concave linings... rammed in a whole heap of high-tension ignition plugs... linked to three-inch hyper-polished exhaust manuals.
The finished product weighing 2.8 tons... is impressive enough to shake any major motor factory to its foundation.
It takes a full year to knock out a vehicle like II Tempo Gigante.
The day Theodore completed the prototype... the Bristol seismograph registered
7,8 on the Richter scale.
Not a bad start for a do-it-yourself village enthusiast.
Here's the late news.
It has been confirmed that II Tempo
Gigante is ready for its supreme test.
People in Pinchcliffe
are confident that Rimspoke...
can show Gore-Slimey
a clean pair of heels.
We shall see when the chips are down.
Time will show!
Hi, you'll frighten them out of their wits!
Sonny! Sonny!
Who is it? Where is he?
I can hear something real horrible.
There must be someone outside snooping around.
Theodore, there's someone snooping around at the dead of night.
I bet it's someone after your car.
I think we should hide in the cellar.
What? In the cellar?
- Night-time intruders?
- Yes, I think there are people about.
Our burglar alarm should deal with car thieves, and it's all set up.
You go to the right, Sonny, on the other side of the coach-house... and I'll go this side.
- And you keep an eye on the door.
- I'm scared, I am, Theodore.
I never been so scared.
Never thought I would ever be so scared.
Hush, someone's coming!
That's Mister Gore-Slimey in the bag all right.
Well, string me up and stuff me in a hen-coop!
Gracious...
So it's you strung up and dangling there, Lambert?
I walked slap into it!
That rope was intended for Rudolph, so you'll have to forgive me, Lambert.
That put the skids on old Gore-Slimey.
Sir Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
We are gathered together to unveil
Rimspoke's technical masterpiece... which in tomorrows Grand Prix will challenge the world's racing drivers... including Rudolph Gore-Slimey in his 12-cylinder Boomerang Rapido.
We're gratified to have TV coverage today... in black and white and in choice colours.
This event is being transmitted
via the Pinchcliffe TV control panel... designed by Theodore Rimspoke and broadcast nationwide... full stop.
To mark this auspicious occasion we have invited one of our greatest brads.
Despite an attack of the sniffles and the handicap of a mane of unruly air... composed a laudatory epic:
Hanbury Dapplenag!
Greetings, mighty son of the desert waste
On whose oil-wells your stupendous wealth is based
By whose presence this ceremony is graced
Our great inventor, thanks to your banking account
Was able to sting you for a sizable amount
And so in this week-end's great race we folk
Can cheer on our hero Theodore Rimspoke
Driving a very speedy vehicle which
Bears the name of my modest shanty:
The racing car II Tempo Gigante!
Thank you, Dapplenag, and may the Government grant your application... for a three-year
Bardic Travelling Scholarship.
And now I shall ask Sheikh Abdul Ben
Bonanza to rise and be upstanding.
As funds from North Sea is not yet available for projects such as these... an overseas sheikh has generously stepped into the breach.
This entitles him to the honour of unveiling this super car.
Sheikh Abdul Ben Bonanza, she's all yours!
I must ask the audience to retain your seats and your composure.
We have TV coverage, and Theodore will now answer a few snaky questions.
Today's news features Rimspoke's sensational II Tempo Gigante... capable of challenging Gore-Slimey's
GT Super Boomerang Rapido.
Congratulations on the car!
I must say, equipped with radar and all?
That's right.
In the event of fog and landslides.
And to anticipate any concealed entrances.
Could we have a rundown?
Let's start with the cranking handle, which starts the engine up forward... which in turn starts the carburettor... which finally activates the rocket engine at the rear.
- And then she really moves, eh?
- You could say that, yes.
And your top speed?
With twelve cylinders and pure alcohol fuel... and a gaggle of rockets raring to go... the old bus could hardly be described as a slowcoach.
This job is designed with front-and rear-wheel drive... as well as direct fuel injection slap in the jet... using the cantilever method.
And I've installed two speedometers... serially linked so that one takes over when the other registers maximum.
- And then this rotary wind-gauge...
- And what about this brake-block?
Same system as on a bike, but reinforced.
- And what's this device?
- That's blood type Rhesus B Plus.
And Rhesus Minus, and a dash of blue blood if we should bump into a baron.
- Or some other aristocrats.
- Very smart.
How about a look at the cockpit?
No. That wouldn't interest the public.
- Top secret, maybe?
- Um...
Well, it only remains for me to wish
Rimspoke every success in the race.
And now back to our compère,
Dairy Manager Oliver Clapthwaite.
Thanking you.
And now our local band will conclude this ceremony... with a specially composed march,
Cantata Opus Two... by pig farmer Archibald Skrimshank.
But first a special welcome to another prominent visitor, Emanuel Desperados.
Private chauffeur, born right round the last bend of the Limpopo River.
He has kindly consented to assist in the role of guest drummer.
And now you can see Sheikh Abdul Ben
Bonanza arriving in his Rolls-Royce... driven by Emanuel Desperados.
This great magnate is the owner of Aladdin Oil.
There's an air of excitement here as we await the start of this epic encounter... between the world's leading drivers.
Now here's No. 3 coming up to start.
The Italian Ruffino Gassolini... known as the Turin Daredevil, in his Bertone Carabo.
No. 12 is the German Heinrich von
Schnellfahrt, in his red Abarth 2000... the celebrated speed-merchant with glass-eye and monocle.
Here's No. 5, the Swede
Ronny Turnip Anderson... the Gothenburg Gogetter, followed by
No. 8, the Argentine Carlos Fandango.
The pampas playboy who ran slap into a wall and escaped without a scratch.
An impressive array of horsepower.
There's one question of special interest to fans: Has Aladdin Oil acted wisely... in staking money and prestige on a mere cycle-repairer?
I imagine the people in Pinchcliffe...
will follow today's event with
special attention to their hero.
Let's have a closer look
at Aladdin Oil.
Rimspoke is just leaving the pits.
What competition can his home-made
design, II Tempo Gigante, offer?
It seems hardly likely that an
prototype built by a cycle-repairer...
will go the full 25 laps
of today's gruelling Grand Prix.
But during yesterdays acceleration test
II Tempo Gigante showed a speed... that ensured it a surprisingly good starting position.
In the Snake Oil pit the director of the
Dry Rot and Fungus Control Authority... and ace driver Gore-Slimey is behind the wheel of his Boomerang Rapido.
Rudolph Gore-Slimey has a string of victories in his car... with a great many hush-hush features.
Only a handful of intimates know what's concealed beneath the black bonnet.
His co-driver, in a cockpit designed on
Spitfire lines, is Eleaser Cassandra... whose gift of second sight has proved invaluable in a tight corner.
Less is known of Theodore Rimspoke's co-driver, Sonny Duckworth.
Two novices to the track that should be watched with interest.
In 30 seconds from now this impressive pack of speed-hungry roadsters... will be streaking across the line in the Grand Prix of the Century.
Five, four, three, two, one!
They're off! The home-made contraption already seems to be in trouble.
This is bound to be a severe disappointment to Aladdin Oil.
The German Heinrich von Schnellfahrt in his Abarth 2000 has taken the lead... closely pursued by the Italian
Ruffino Gassolini and Gore-Slimey.
But now it looks like they've managed to crank II Tempo Gigante into action.
She seems to be firing on all twelve cylinders.
She's off, and good luck to her.
She's got a lot of leeway to make up.
Not a very encouraging start
for the good people of Pinchcliffe.
It does really look as if Rimspoke is putting his best foot forward.
Gore-Slimey in the lead followed by
McQuick, the Swede and Gassolini.
In a moment they'll be completing the first lap.
Gore-Slimey has been passed by the Irishman McQuick.
Here they come. Gore-Slimey flashing past still in the lead.
With nine laps to go, Rimspoke is lagging 30 seconds behind the leaders.
He has a lot of ground to make up.
And now the Argentine ace
Carlos Fandango goes into the lead.
And now it looks as if Rimspoke really has got his horsepower harnessed.
By my stopwatch he's pulled in as much as 15 seconds on his first lap... which is sensational. We should not write off Aladdin Oil's chances yet.
Gore-Slimey once again in the lead with
Nos. 4, 12, 3, 8 and 5 in hot pursuit.
Followed by Rimspoke.
He must have put in a tremendous burst!
Rimspoke's backers are clearly elated.
The wee chappie now facing the camera is one of Rimspoke's rusty assistants.
No doubt his first visit
on a race-track.
A popular feature
in this tough competition.
A message: Would the owner of the car registered PP 14U2... parked on a manhole outside
Entrance C kindly remove his vehicle... as a Drainage and Water Board inspector is anxious to return home.
We are just coming up for another lap.
And Gore-Slimey is still in the lead.
Amazing what Rimspoke is getting out of his car.
Can he really keep going?
Rimspoke has now rejoined the bunch, and Schnellfahrt answers with a spurt.
Rimspoke's giving all his got, but seems to be having trouble with his engine.
He's falling back.
But he's picking up again... and is hot on the heels of
McQuick, Gassolini and Anderson.
Going into the hairpin bend we get a ding-dong struggle... between Schnellfahrt and Rimspoke.
Out of the bend we have
Gore-Slimey and Rimspoke.
Rimspoke must have gone into a bit of a skid. His car seems a bit stern-heavy.
There's a dramatic tussle going on, with Gore-Slimey still in the lead.
And there goes Rimspoke, shooting into the lead. Aladdin Oil... is leading in the Grand Prix!
II Tempo Gigante passing the stands with a clear lead.
But it sounds like she is misfiring?
The subsequent order is Gore-Slimey,
Fandango, Schnellfahrt, Gassolini... and the Swede Turnip Anderson.
Rimspoke is clearly in trouble.
His engine is definitely labouring.
Gore-Slimey is coming up hand over first.
Now he's passed him and is in the lead again!
Things seem to be going disastrously wrong for Rimspoke and Aladdin Oil.
Rimspoke is being overhauled by the rest of the field. My, what a pity.
After such a splendid performance by this unusual vehicle!
But that's the way things go!
Snake Oil first with the German second.
Just behind these two comes Fandango.
The field's spreading out now.
And here's the Swede leaving the pits after a spot of trouble.
But II Tempo Gigante is obviously in still greater trouble.
She is being taken hand of by her team of mechanics.
Now the German seems to be making a bid. Fandango breathing down his neck.
The field seems to be massing for a thrilling attack on the leaders.
Rimspoke is really back in the race!
Talk about a quick start! Nothing like it since the Apollo went into orbit.
Driver and co-driver must have been subject to something like 3 G!
Once again Rimspoke challenges the cream of the world's racing drivers.
This can develop into something truly spectacular!
Looks as if Aladdin Oil have called on their second driver. What a gamble!
Gassolini holding on to a slim lead, closely followed by the others.
What about Rimspoke and his new second driver?
It's obvious that II Tempo Gigante is now performing superbly.
Rimspoke is closing in on the field.
But Gore-Slimey has pulled ahead and has a clear lead.
Gore-Slimey has a commanding lead, and passes... there.
The rest of the field is nicely bunched, with the German in front.
But Rimspoke is now only seven seconds behind the German.
Rimspoke, clearly full of go is only
15 seconds behind Gore-Slimey.
It's going to be hard to predict the winner.
Things are really hotting up.
The German is back in the lead... with the others breathing down his neck.
Il Tempo Gigante is putting on a terrific spurt and catching up!
It's a neck-and-neck struggle between
Gore-Slimey and Theodore Rimspoke.
Gore-Slimey is just hanging on to his lead... but the others are hard on his heels.
Gore-Slimey and Rimspoke are leaving the rest of the field inexorably behind.
Now what's happening?
Gore-Slimey pulls away.
Rimspoke is in trouble, with II Tempo
Gigante threatening to disintegrate.
Gore-Slimey is starting on the last lap.
But where is Rimspoke?
There! He seems to have got his engine going full blast once again!
Gore-Slimey can't be sure of victory.
Both cars being squeezed to the limit.
This is the last and decisive lap, and
a final maximum effort is called for.
This speed must be a terrific strain
on chassis, engine, tyres,...
and the drivers themselves.
Here things are really getting dramatic.
Il Tempo Gigante is enveloped in smoke.
Is she on fire?
A highly dramatic finish!
Rimspoke comes out of the bend with
Gore-Slimey scraping his exhaust.
He flashes across the line there!
Winner of the Grand Prix of the century!
In third place the German, followed by the Argentinean, Irishman and Italian.
What a race, what a finish, and what a triumph for our village cycle-repairer... and a sheikh who staked his reputation and money on his intuition.
We congratulate Pinchcliffe, the native village of the three worthies... who ensured II Tempo Gigante such a sensational triumph.
The cup and the laurels were just one more incident... in the lives of Theodore,
Sonny, and Lambert.
They'll be back at their daily chores tomorrow, with petty quarrels... inventions and the manufacture of flagpoles for the Swiss Navy.
- Tonight you have the inside berth!
- Can I?
- Is that really possible?
- Take the inside when I tell you to!
Goodness me!
Snitchery pooh.
- Nighty!
- Nighty!
English subtitles:
Trine Borg
# You heard 'bout the legend of Jesse James
# And John Henry just to mention some names
# Well, there's a truck-drivin' legend in the South today
# A man called Bandit from Atlanta, Ga.
# Every gearjammer knows his name
# They swear he got asphalt a- runnin' in his veins
# A foot like lead and nerves like steel
# He's gonna go to glory ridin' 18 wheels
# Oh, boy
# He left Atlanta back in '63
# Haulin' him a load up to Tennessee
# He hit Mount Eagle in a drivin' rain
# So hard he couldn't even see the passin' lane
# Well, he started down the grade when he lost a gear
# He hit them brakes, found he had no air
# The Mount Eagle grade is steep and long
# And everybody that seen it thought the Bandit was gone
# All gone
# Well, his truck jack-knifed turned completely around
# He was comin' down backwards
'bout the speed of sound
# A lot of folks seen him and they all say
# He had his head out the window yellin', "Clear the way!"
# Well, he got to the bottom safe and sound
# Everybody asked Bandit how he made it down
# He said, "Folks, when the truck picked up too much speed
# "I just run along beside it and drug my feet"
# Ya heard the legend of Jesse James
# And John Henry just to mention some names
# Well, there's a truck-drivin' legend in the South today
# A man called Bandit from Atlanta, Ga.
# Every gearjammer knows his name
# They swear he's got asphalt a- runnin' in his veins
# A foot like lead and nerves like steel
# He's goin' up to glory ridin' 18 wheels
# Ah, tell me, boy
# Talk to me, guitar #
Hey, Kirk. How ya doin'?
Tod Engels. How are ya?
- This your rig, son?
- Yeah.
Open it up. Let's see the manifest.
Well, placin' you under arrest for transportin' alcoholic beverages across state lines without the proper permits.
And that means you, you dumb cowboy.
You know truckin' Coors beer east of Texas is bootleggin'.
- This here's Georgia, son.
- Just a friendly bet.
These two old boys put me up to it.
Now, when ya gonna learn?
Big and Little Enos Burdette make that same bet with every gearjammer they can.
I say he ain't gonna go for your game.
Son, from what I've heard, the biggest thing about the Bandit is his ego, and I figure that, plus a lot of my dollars, and he'll try anything, legal or not.
They've put on quite a show for us today, haven't they, friends?
Yes, sir, you have seen some of the finest gearjammin' in all of this country.
Remember, these are the boys that take the long hauls. They really did it today.
- Hoss... Where might I find the Bandit?
- I ain't seen him.
- Over there behind his rig.
- Who wants to see him?
- Who's askin'?
- I'm askin'.
'Cause I'm the guy payin' him $25 a day so all his loyal fans can look at him.
Do it.
I'm buyin' your attraction for a half an hour.
Egotistical son of a bitch.
A guy that paints his truck like this would go to a minister's funeral dressed in feathers.
See, son? Old legends never die. They just lose weight.
Seems like a legend and an out-of-work bum look a lot alike, Daddy.
Bandit, me and my son are here.
Oh, I love your suits.
It must be a bitch gettin' a size
68 extra-fat and a 12 dwarf.
I came to make a deal. What's he get if he wins this truck rodeo thing?
- If?!
- $5,000, Daddy.
- Chicken-shit money.
- Just what the hell you want, anyway?
You to get out of this dumb-ass rodeo and accept a real challenge.
Gettin' to Texarkana and back in 28 hours, that's no problem.
- It ain't never been done before, hotshit.
- Watch your language, little lady.
The problem is that Coors beer.
You take that east of Texas and that's, uh... that's bootleggin'.
I believe you're just a little bit scared.
Great psychology. Why don't you say somethin' bad about my mother?
- Your mama is so ugly...
- Look, you make this run for me.
These Peterbilts are worth $80,000.
That comes to about three grand an hour if you make it in 28 hours.
How about that for a challenge?
- Dad, I don't believe that that's necess...
- Never mind.
Wait a minute. Why do you want that beer so bad?
Because he's thirsty, dummy.
You see, I got a boy runnin' tomorrow in the Southern Classic.
When he wins,
I wanna celebrate in style.
- How much style?
- Well, I got a few friends and me.
400 cases.
- 400 cases...?
- Well?
- Well, let me see your cash.
- Big Enos's word is gold.
All right, show him the cash.
- Go ahead, Little.
- Shit.
Let's see. There's 400 cases of beer,
I'll need the cash for that.
No problem. Go ahead, boy.
New car. Gotta have a new car to block for the truck.
- OK. Go ahead, boy.
- I'd like to kick his ass just once.
Speedy car.
Speedier than that.
Go ahead.
- Hello, darlin'.
- Hi, Uncle Bandit.
- Which one of the house apes are you?
- Kate.
He's droppin' 'em like flies, isn't he?
Well, well, well. Hello, beautiful.
- How about 'gorgeous'?
- You can't have him.
Obviously you can. What are you tryin' to do, start another race?
Look, you got Cledus in jail once.
Leave us alone!
- Hi, Uncle Bandit!
- He ain't your damn uncle!
I always recognise you! You know why?
You always kick me in the balls!
Damn it, Bandit! Look at me!
I find it hard to look at you, Waynette, especially with those things in your hair.
Makes me think you're listening to a radio station in Savannah.
You can't go in there and bother Cledus.
Hey! This is my home!
- Cledus.
- No!
I know in the past
I may have done you wrong.
- Right?
- Right.
However, in the future, Cledus,
I will never, ever do you wrong again.
- Right?
- Right.
We have a big chance, a big chance to make a run for some big bucks.
- 80,000 of them.
- Really?
- Are we gonna kidnap the Pope or somethin'?
- How'd you guess?
No. We're just gonna run over to Texarkana and pick up 400 cases of Coors and bring it back in 28 hours.
Whoa! I got a flash for you.
That's called bootleggin', and that's against the law.
Who gives a turkey when the Snowman and the Bandit are runnin' the booze?
- No one can stop us.
- Hold it right there.
There ain't gonna be no more
Snowman and Bandit.
Because I've got to go in the morning to Conyers and pick up a load of manure.
- Shitty job.
- Can I ask you a question?
Sure. Ask me.
What the hell do we wanna go to
Texas for and haul beer back here?
For the good old American life.
For the money, for the glory and for the fun.
Mostly for the money. You know what we're gonna do with the money?
- What?
- We're gonna buy a new rig.
- You're crazy, you know that.
- Yeah.
- How much money did you say it was?
- Hm.
- Waynette!
Now, Bo, I'm tellin' ya,
Fred here ain't gonna be no problem.
- I can see he'll be a major asset.
- Besides, he's one hellacious watchdog.
- Well, let's get goin'.
- Whoa. Hold it a minute.
I got to ask you a question.
Sit right there, Fred.
You mean to tell me we're gonna drive from here to Texarkana, Texas, and back to here in 28 hours?
It's only 900 miles there and 900 miles back.
Well, for your information, that ain't never been done, not in no rig.
'Cause you and I never done it in no rig.
You gotta stop thinkin' so negative.
'Course we can make it.
We ain't never not made it yet, have we?
- Well, no.
- You see? There you are.
Yeah. Yeah, I see. I see all right.
I see our asses in a sling if we get caught, that's what I see.
Hey! Ho-ho-ho!
Well, God Almighty, would you look at that!
- It's beautiful, huh?
- Honey, hush.
I don't guess we're gonna be ridin' in the truck together this time?
No, son. I'll be drivin' this one and blockin'.
You'll be drivin' the truck.
This is Bandit One and that is...
...Bandit Two. Together again.
- Like Fred and Ginger and Lester and Earl.
- That's right. But we got a problem.
You know them Smokeys got them CBs in the car now.
I haven't worked that out yet, but I'm thinkin' about it.
I got an idea.
Why don't we do this?
If I say go to channel 21, forget it.
We ain't goin' to 21, we're goin' to 19.
- 21 is 19?
- If I say go to channel six, forget it.
- We go to three.
- I go to three. Perfect.
- If I say go to channel two, we go to one.
- Two is one.
- That'll confuse everybody.
- That'll confuse 'em.
On the other hand, if we stayed on the odd channels, switched every time and started in the basement, that'd work, too.
- That'd do it, too, wouldn't it?
- Well, yeah, that'd work too, I guess.
- Let's haul ass.
- OK.
Breaker One. This is the Bandit.
Is the Snowman out there?
- Am I hittin'ya, son?
- Mercy sakes.
You put about eight and a half on me, blowin' my windows out. Bring it on.
I'll be within earshot.
You keep it wound up to around 90.
- Hey, Bandit. Me and Fred's got a question.
- What do you and Fred want?
How come we're doing this?
They said it couldn't be done.
- That's the reason.
- That's good with Fred!

- Big town, ain't it?
- I wonder what they do for excitement.
They probably sit around and watch the cars rust.
- Damn it, it's locked.
- We're about an hour ahead of schedule.
- Let's keep it that way.
- All right.
Hey, want a beer?
- Well, son!
- Redneck heaven.
- How we gonna load all this stuff, though?
- I'll load it with this.
- You can't drive no forklift.
- I can drive any forkin' thing around.
- Get serious! Can you drive this thing?
- I am serious.
- Crank it up. Now back it up.
- Oh, shut up!
- I said back it up, not raise it up!
- I am backin' up, ya big dumbbell!
Hold it! The beer! Watch the beer!
- You all right?
- Very funny Very funny
I thought it was funny.
Hey, we really oughta pay somebody for that mess we made in there.
- All right, have you...
- I got that all worked out.
You just leave a note. Tell the folks to send the bill to Big Enos Burdette.
"Send... bill... to... Big... Enos... Burdette. "
Burdette. B...
B- e-r... B-u-r... B...
Hell, I got to go.
Hey, Spiderman, are you out there? Come back.
Snowman! How we doin', son?
Come on back.
Hang on just a minute, and I'll tell ya.
We're about 28 minutes ahead of schedule.
- Come back.
- I hate to say I told you so.
Don't lose your head, son.
We still got a lot of boogiein' to do.
Put the pedal to the metal.
I'm 10-10 on the side.
For sure. Me and Fred, we got your back door, ain't we, Fred?
- Sorry. I don't want to get married.
- Terrific. That makes two of us.
- Will you unzip me?
- Sure.
- Does this thing move?
- Oh, yeah.
Where are we going?
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.
- We are a bride in search of a wedding.
- No.
There is a wedding in search of a bride.
Let me put it another way.
Think of it as a wedding posse in search of a bride.
- You understand that, cowboy?
- Yeah.
What are ya doin'?
- These are my shoes.
- Oh, yeah.
- And these are my legs.
- Yeah.
- What are you gonna do with them?
- With the shoes or the legs?
Last time I saw legs like that, they had a message tied to 'em.
What do you mean? These are great little legs. I'm a professional.
Well, in that case, you shouldn't be dressed in white.
- Dancer.
- Oh.
Well, cowboys love fat calves.
- They're not fat.
- They're bigger than mine.
- Do we really wanna talk about legs?
- One of us does.
Otherwise we wouldn't have gone...
What are we doing now?
Well, I am getting my clothes, you fool.
Good idea. Why don't you slip into somethin' comfortable?
Are we really going 110?
We're going 110!
Why do you wear that cowboy hat?
Because you think it looks dazzling on you.
I'd no idea this dress would be so hard to get out of.
Hold up on that car wash, gentlemen.
Come here, son.
Whoops!
You look tired, boy. Rest yourself.
You punks look tuckered out, too.
That's an attention-getter.
- Now, a lady in a weddin' gown.
- Yes, sir.
- Get in a car?
- Yes, sir.
- See who was drivin'?
- N-no, sir.
- Licence plate?
- Y-yes, sir. Georgia plates.
"Ban-one. "
B- A-N dash O-N-E.
All right. Now, you boys just stay here and watch the car.
There might be some vandals around who wanna steal somethin', so you boys just stay here and keep your hands on the car until one of my associates arrive.
And don't go home, don't go to eat, and don't play with yourself.
It wouldn't look nice on my highway.
Oh, you can think about it, but don't do it.
Hey, man, he's gone.
Let's get outta here.
Shit! You do what you want.
I'm stayin' right here.
28 years old and... Oh, goodness, what's this? I'll tuck it right in.
I was down here dancing in a home appliance show.
- I danced around three trash mashers.
- Talk to me, my boy.
I had this costume that lit up.
I only short-circuited once.
- Where did you get that seat cover, son?
- This ain't no seat cover.
- I was standing in the parking lot...
- I'm sitting next to Lawrence of Arabia.
I met this guy... These can't be my pants.
God, he was good-looking.
- And he had this hat on...
- Funny, ain't she?
I think he was from Texas or something, and I thought, "Why not marry the guy?"
Nobody walks out on a pretty weddin' I set up.
I'm gonna get that girl and set everything straight.
She insulted my town.
She insulted my son.
- Look, what if we...
- Shut up! She insulted my authority.
And that's nothin' but pure and simple old-fashioned Communism.
It happens every time one of those dancers starts poontangin' around... with those show-folk fags.
Halfway down the aisle I said to myself,
"Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
His mother doesn't even have any teeth!"
I jumped in this car, and it blew up on the side of the road, and I ended up in this goddamn airplane.
What do you do?
I don't remember.
- Oh, are we on the air?
- Sort of, yeah.
You think I'm... nuts, don't you?
No, I don't think you're crazy.
I picked up three brides yesterday, just like you, very subdued.
Hey, what... what's goin' on up there?
- Come back, Bandit.
- Bandit?
- Is that your name or your profession?
- That's my handle. Bo's my real name.
- What's your name?
- Carrie.
Is she wearing a wedding dress?
She was.
What's she wearin' now?
Come back.
Hey, you got peanut butter or somethin' in your ears?
Tell me what that woman's got on... her mind!
No coozie's gonna leave me at no church.
Decoratin' up a whole town at a cost of $40.
Right.
I can see her now, runnin' back up that aisle...
No, she was dancin' back up the aisle, her knockers bouncin' all over the joint.
Let go of that wheel.
Why, her ass was wigglin', too.
Why so fast?
You're late for a big bowling date?
Cute.
- So, tell me about yourself.
- What do you wanna know, my sign?
- What do you do besides drive fast?
- Have fun.
- Is this fun?
- Drivin'?
- Driving, talking to me.
- They're both a challenge.
- You've got a great profile.
- Yeah, don't I? Especially from the side.
At least we finally agree on something.
Yeah. We both like half my face.
Hey, would a cop taking a leak on the side of the road interest you?
Yes, it would.
- He's taking a 10-100.
- At least it's better than a 10-200.
- Smokey.
- Smokey.
- Is this fun?
- I forgot to tell ya:
I'm runnin' blocker for 400 cases of illegal Coors.
Holy shit!
I don't believe this.
Funny, I don't remember that turn.
- Bandit, where the hell are you?
- I'll be back on the highway in a second.
All right, good buddy.
I'll keep my eyes peeled.
- Them things are fabulous.
- I think I just went 10-100.
- Well, it's better than 10-200.
- That's true.
# Well, the more wheels I got the better I like it.
# I'm the brother of a truck-driving mother boogity, boogity, boogity, boogity. #
- Snowman, you got your ears on?
- You lucky devil, you got him.
- Where the hell are you?
- I'm on a two-lane blacktop.
Highway marker number 71.
How's our time doin'?
Oh, how are we doin' on time?
About 25 minutes ahead of schedule.
- What's your 20?
- I'm about four miles ahead of you, turkey.
Not for long.
- Breaker to the Bandit.
- Come on back, breaker.
Bandit, I've got a smokey report for you. Come on.
- Well, talk to me, good buddy.
- You've got trouble comin'.
Well, what's your handle, son, and, uh, what's your 20?
My handle's Smokey Bear, and I'm tail-grabbin'your ass right now.
Goddamn. That's a Texas mountie.
What the hell's he doin' in Arkansas?
Well, let's just see what he's got under the hood.
Bye-bye, baby!
You smoke much?
I just started.
- Cledus, you got your ears on, son?
- Oh, bring it on, you lucky devil.
- Comin' around you.
- Be careful.
You're gonna have to make your own lane,
'cause you definitely got oncoming traffic.
Be careful. Be careful.
Oh, my... Oh, my God!
I'm about to be killed in this... in this moving CB radio show, and I... I don't even have a handle!
You want a handle?
OK, I'll think one up for ya. Let's see.
- Oh, I got one for ya!
- What?
Just give me a minute here.
He done good, didn't he, Fred?
What?
Frog.
- Why?
- 'Cause you're always hoppin' around.
And you're kinda cute like a frog, and... I'd like to jump ya.
Nobody...
Nobody makes Sheriff Buford T. Justice look like a possum's pecker.
- Except for that...
- Shut your ass.
- Break for that, Bandit One.
- Yeah, Snowman, come on back.
That was a Texas bubblegum machine on your back door.
- A Texas bubblegum machine?
- Yeah, I saw him.
You ain't gonna believe this, but that crazy sombitch tried to drive up under my truck.
What's a Texas county mountie doing in Arkansas?
- I don't know.
- I don't know.
I don't know!
- Well, who the hell knows?
- I really don't know.
What we're dealin' with here is a complete lack of respect for the law.
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice.
I'm in pursuit of a black TransAm.
He's all mine, so stay outta the way.
This is Sheriff George Branford of Deeson County, Arkansas.
We are apprised of the situation and are taking appropriate measures.
Did you say you are a sheriff?
That's a big 10-4!
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice of Texas!
Texas? You know, of course, that you're out of your jurisdiction.
I suggest that you let my department handle the situation.
That's very comfortin', but I'm in a high-speed pursuit.
- Don't you hear good?
- I hear perfectly.
The fact that you are a sheriff is not germane to the situation.
The goddamn Germans got nothin' to do with it!
- What?
- Shut up! One shit at a time!
- What do ya see?
- We lost him.
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice again.
I lost that TransAm.
Set up a roadblock.
- Good idea!
- What the hell you know?
I believe we have the situation well under control, Sheriff.
Breaker, breaker, lookin' for the Bandit.
- You out there, son?
- You got the Bandit. Come on back.
My handle's Silver-Tongued Devil. Your fellow
CBers are mighty proud of ya out there.
Thank ya, son. I appreciate it.
Tell me, you comin' up on Fayetteville and Interstate 82?
- We're almost on top of it.
- I got a big bad bear story for you there.
I just rolled past a county mountie roadblock.
- You ARE a silver-tongued devil.
- That's a big 10-4, good buddy.
Well, you keep your wheels spinnin' and the beavers grinnin', then. I'm out.
Why, thank you, Officer.
- Classy guy.
- Classy guy.
Did you see that? They went right through our roadblock.
You sombitches couldn't close an umbrella.
You know somethin', Sheriff? If J.W.
Don't get out of my way, I'll pass him.
Where? In the woods?
I don't care if your daddy is the mayor.
You wreck this car, it'll come outta your pay.
- Yeah, but he's gettin' away.
- Son, he's not goin' anywhere.
The Mulberry Bridge has been dismantled for the past six months.
That's not good.
It would be better with a whole bridge.
And that's worse.
- Why don't you drop me off? I'll catch a cab.
- Too late now.
We did it! We did it!
See? I didn't wreck it, Sheriff.
We jumped over that bridge!
- Did you see what we did?
- Yes, I did.
I wanna jump something else! I wanna jump a house! I wanna jump something!
Well, jump me.
- Honest to God, it wasn't my fault! I stopped!
- Yeah, right.
Hey, boy, where's Sheriff Branford?
I am Sheriff Branford.
Oh, hey...
For some reason or another, you sounded a little taller on radio.
What the hell is the world comin' to?
Sounds good to me,
Tower of Power. Listen, buddy...
- What channel we on?
- What?
- What channel are we on?
Snowman, are you out there?
I'm doin' what I'm supposed to be doin'.
What are y'all doing, he'n' and she'n'?
- Come back.
- Oh, we were playin' a little bridge.
- How we been doin'?
- We're losin' minutes, son.
If you don't get up here and run me some interference, we ain't never gonna make it.
I'll drop the dolly off at a choke-and-puke, and then I'll get right back on the job.
All right.
10-4 on that choke-and-puke.
- Oh, by the way, Bandit...
- Yeah, guy?
How 'bout bringin' me a hamburger for Fred?
I'm beginnin' to worry about him.
- He's lookin' a little thin in the skin.
- You got 'em.
- Choke-and-puke.
- Choke-and-puke.
- That's where I'll get off?
- Right.
You oughta give up smokin'.
That's bad for your health.
But I enjoy it so much.
I guess you can get your ticket over there.
- You got enough money?
- Yeah.
I have enough to get to Jersey, walk the rest of the way.
- Hey, thanks.
- Oh, it was nothing.
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.
Frog?
You gonna be all right?
Yeah... I'm always all right.
Can I have a couple of cheeseburgers to go and a glass of iced tea?
How much I owe ya, ma'am?
- A dollar and a half.
- Keep the change.
Just keep your eye out for that Mr Bandit bastard!
Let me have a diablo sandwich, a Dr Pepper.
Make it fast. I'm in a goddamn hurry.
- You want somethin'?
- A hush puppy, Daddy.
We got no time for that crap!
Dumb sombitch!
- Diablo and Doc.
- Thank you, nice lady.
- You must be in a hell of a hurry, Sheriff?
- You bet your ass on that, boy.
Oh, you got a little mess there.
Let me help you get that off there...
- Yeah, yeah. Much obliged.
- Yeah.
Who ya chasin'?
Somebody chasin' you?
Nobody chasin' me, boy.
I been chasin' a goddamn maniac all the way from Texarkana, Texas.
Really?
What is he, a bank robber?
Bank robber?
Bank robbin' is baby shit alongside of what this dude is doin'.
Almost killed 20 law officers.
Drivin' through people's backyards, knockin' down mailboxes.
He's got a broad in the car, took her across the state line.
That's the Mann Act.
I don't think he's got her permission, and that's kidnapping.
- How's that for high jinks?
- Yeah.
- What I owe?
- Oh, let me pay for it.
- You're an officer of the law. I'd be honoured.
- Much obliged.
- Where's the can? I gotta take a squirt.
- Right back there. Just used it.
Hey! Hey!
What are you doin' in my car?
- You're goin' the wrong way!
- Oh.
- Hang on!
- What the hell are ya doin'?
- Sheriff Justice is in there!
- I know! I know!
- Thank you, nice lady.
- Sure thing.
Yoo-hoo! Sheriff!
Oh, boy.
Nice ass.
I didn't want to be dumped at any old truck stop.
- I wanted to stay with you.
- Well, why didn't you ask?
You might've said no, and I have a hard time handling rejections.
We're gainin' on 'em.
I think it'd be a good idea if we changed places, don't you?
You be a passenger for a while now.
Up, up... I'll just slide right...
- Oh, you got my hair.
- Sorry. I'll slide right under.
- Ooh, I don't know. Wait. Wait. Wait!
- I got it. I got it!
- Wait a minute!
- Wait a minute!
Hold it! I'm stuck here.
This is not workin'.
- I got my foot on the...
- Goddamn it! I seen it in the movies!
Oh, my God!
Duck, or you're gonna be talkin' outta your ass!
- Daddy, the top came off.
- No shit
Snowman! How are your vocal cords?
Well, my vocal cords are fine.
I'm a little worried about Fred now.
He's been gnawing everything, barkin' and screamin'. He's turned into a stalk of bananas.
- What's your 20?
- About 16 miles this side of Mississippi.
Whoa, hold it. I just passed another Kojak with a Kodak.
This place is crawlin' with bears.
Where the hell are you? Come back.
I'm still tryin' to get rid of that Texas County mountie. I don't know what the hell he wants.
You know what he wants. How would you like to be the dude that handcuffs a legend?
Give me five minutes, we'll put some moves on that mother. I'll meet ya at Old Miss.
You'd better hurry, or we can just kiss that money goodbye. Understand?
I read you loud and clear. 10-4.
You got the one Snowman.
I'm eastbound and down.
We gone, killer.
That's the way I wanna go out.
Hey, man, watch it!
- What the hell was that?
- A left, or half a 'u'.
Well, please don't do it anymore.
Hey, you know who that was?
Check this out.
Bandit, this here's the Grave Robber.
Put the pedal to the metal, and we'll hold this county mountie as long as we can.
- Well, go, girl, go!
- I'm goin'! I'm goin'!
I've got the metal to the pedal, and the thing to the floor...
Damn, he had a lot of friends, didn't he?
If they had cremated the son of a bitch,
I could've been kickin' that Mr Bandit's ass around the moon by now.
Hold my hat!
- My hat blew off, Daddy.
- I hope your goddamn head was in it.
- OK. We're gonna switch.
- OK.
I'm comin' over underneath you.
You just slide right on over.
I think I'm in love with your belt buckle.
Close. Colourful, but close.
I like this seat better anyway.
Yes, have a smoke. It seems to help.
Come on, defence!
Come on, Billy Ray, get tough!
You know, I wanted to be a high-fashion model once.
But, hell, how long can you model clothes for 8-year-olds? Boys.
Besides that, my cheeks were too fat.
These cheeks, these.
Aarghhh!
- Oh, my goodness, we're airborne here.
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, look, a football game!
- There's kids! For Christ's sake, watch out!
- Don't hit the kids!
- Get your hands off my wheel!
Lean to the left, lean to the right...
Stand up there and see if you can see where the hell they went.
- Can you see anything?
- It's a football game. Can we watch, Daddy?
- You stay and watch. I'm goin' back!
- But, Daddy...
# Bandit, you're reckless and you live much too hard #
Oughta be in Nashville.
Snowman, are ya out there, son?
What's your 20? Where are you?
I'm at mile marker 85. Come back.
Son-of-a-gun! So am I!
Well, damned if ya ain't.
Damned if ya ain't.
Cledus... This is Frog.
Hello, Frog. I want you to meet Fred, Frog.
- This is for Fred.
- Frog, feed Fred.
What's wrong with you? You were gonna dump the chick at the truck stop.
- I ran into complications.
- You always run into complications.
Always the same, some chick.
We ain't doin' good time.
- What are we yappin' for?
- It's the chick.
- Switch down to the next channel, right?
- Yeah.
Hey, Bandit? Nice ass.
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks a lot.
All right, Fred. Come on.
Let's go, boy. Come on.
Fred, I'm tired of pickin' you up... Fred!
- Did Cledus call you a legend?
- Uh-huh.
- Why?
- Well, I used to do some crazy things.
- I used to.
- Oh.
So did I.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two... I'm a gypsy... four.
That's someone who goes from chorus line to chorus line... six, seven, eight.
- You know, I was on Broadway once.
- Really?
- For almost 12 minutes.
- Oh.
The show closed the first night.
But, God, I was so good. You shoulda seen me. You'd have loved me.
What do you do? Straight.
I just go from place to place and... do what I do best.
- What's that?
- Show off.
Yeah. You do do that well.
You do.
So do I.
Five, six, seven, eight.
- For almost 12 minutes.
- Oh, shut up!
Come here, Fred. Come here, boy.
Fred, don't you make me come after you.
Get over here, Fred! Come here.
I'm in a hurry, and you want to swim.
You're drivin' me crazy, Fred.
What is the matter with you, Fred?
That's it for you and the truck drivin'!
Look, I've got to go 10-100.
Could I have a dime?
- Crawl under.
- Terrific.
"Crawl under. "
- TransAm! What's your pleasure?
- Fill it up, my man.
Gimme that talker.
Hello? Mr Bandit?
Would you just happen to be listenin' out there?
Can you hear me, boy?
This is the Bandit.
Who've I got at that end?
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice of Texas.
Well, hot damn.
Welcome to Mississippi, Sheriff.
Thank you, Mr Bandit.
And I got a big welcome waitin' for you when I get you back home, you sombitch!
Don't you cuss on this here radio.
I apologise to all the friendly folk who are listenin'.
Now hear this, you tick turd:
I'm gonna get you.
I didn't come all the way this far to go home with empty pockets.
I been meanin' to ask you that.
How come you're followin' me?
I'd be delighted to tell you, Mr Bandit.
You see, when I get you back home,
I'm gonna find the tallest tree in the country,
and then I'm gonna hang you from it.
- Sheriff?
- I'm listenin'.
Do the letters F.O.
Mean anything to you?
Smart aleck.
You keep this one for yourself.
- Have a smooth ride, Mr Bandit.
- Thank you, partner.
Oof!
Snowman, I'm right beside you.
Looks like we got a clear shot all the way to the 'Bama state line.
Oh, a clear shot?
I'm gonna believe that when I see it.
This is Sheriff Buford T. Justice puttin' out an all-point advisory.
That black TransAm is now headed toward Alabama.
What happened, Daddy?
Get back in the goddamn car.
You know who I feel has revolutionised the American musical theatre?
- Stephen Sondheim.
- Yeah?
- Who's that?
- Stephen Sondheim?
- Does he do a lot of musicals and stuff?
- Yeah.
- He ever do anything with Brenda Lee?
- Does she dance?
- She spins. She's a little spinner.
- Oh, they were a good group.
- The Spinners were good. Yeah.
- Yeah.
Have you ever been in any plays?
Holy shit. We got a lot of company up there.
A lot of company.
- Sarge, here he comes.
- Yeah, I got eyes.
- Are you ready, Roy?
- I was born ready.
Don't just stand there. Go get him!
- Drives pretty good, don't he, Sarge?
- We'll see about that.
- Sarge, you OK?
- You see me movin', don't ya?
- Wanna do a little pond hopping, Frog?
- Uh... Swell.
Now, I know you're in a little distress here, but did you see a black TransAm go by?
He caused all of this, the Bandit.
Ain't he somethin'?
The Bandit ain't nothin'.
He's a mental case.
Good shit!
Banzai!
I saw that, you sombitch!
You did that on purpose!
You're goin' away till you're grey!
I got the evidence!
Put the evidence in the car.
- But, Daddy...
- Put the evidence in the car!
I'm gonna barbecue your ass in molasses!
Put the evidence in the back.
There's no way, no way... that you could come from my loins.
When I get home, the first thing I'm gonna do is punch your mama in the mouth.
I- I'll be with you in a moment, young man.
Bandit, honey, this is the Good
Witch of the North speakin'.
You'd better not come this way.
There's been a little fender bender here on 64.
- Snowman, you copy that?
- Yeah, I got a four on that.
That'll work for me, 'cause I need to pull off, suck up a little go-go juice and put some groceries down my neck.
Y'all be careful and I'll catch ya later.
- One Snowman. I'm playin' on the side.
- We'll be 10-10 on the side.
Lady, don't you know you're supposed to signal?
Oh? Really?
# They call you the Bandit
# An outlaw untamed
# Shackled only by freedom
# You wear no man's chain
We got some time.
You wanna stretch your legs, Frog?
# Some say they despise you
# Well, maybe they do
# But deep down inside them
# I bet they wish they were you
Fill her up, hoss.
Come on, Frederick.
Come on, boy, my boy.
Let's go get some of Lamar's greasy spoon.
I'm gonna put you on a diet, Fred. Mercy.
Come on, Fred. Come on, boy.
Inside.
Come on, boy.
Lamar, surprise.
Look who's here.
- I knew you was comin'.
- Hi, Snowman.
What do you mean, you knew I was comin'?
Lamar, you're rotten to the core, you know that.
About as rotten as that food you've been poisonin' me with...
- How many do you want?
- I don't know. Fix the same thing.
Just cook the onions this time.
- How have you been, Sugar Bear?
- Pretty good. You, Snowman?
Oh, pretty good, considering the shape I'm in.
Say hello to Waynette.
Looks like old Fred's gettin' fat.
Yeah, tell me about it. It damn sure ain't from eatin' the food at this joint.
- Tell me about that.
- I know it.
By the way, where did you get all them warthogs back there?
Damn if I know. They slid in here a little while ago.
I'm gonna slide on out.
Catch you later, Snowman.
Yeah, why don't you just leave me?
Yes, operator?
This is a collect call from Cledus Snow.
No, I am not Hank Snow's brother. No.
Hey, sugarbabe, how you doin'?
- Could I ask you something?
- Sure.
Do you think we have anything in common?
Besides being chased around the country in that feckuckteh car?
Yeah.
Like what?
Have you ever seen the Broadway show Chorus Line?
No.
You like Elton John?
No.
- Do you know who Casey Tibbs is?
- Baseball player.
- Close. Richard Petty?
- No.
- Waylon Jennings? No.
- No.
When you tell somebody somethin', it depends on what part of the United States you're standin' in... as to just how dumb you are.
Mr Bandit, you have a lyrical way of cutting through the bullshit.
And you have a unique way with the English language, Miss Frog.
# Bandit steals a lady's heart
# With only a smile
- Don't you take that hat off for anything?
- Sure.
I take it off for one thing, and one thing only.
# And you live much too hard
# Bandit, you're the joker
- If we were lost on a desert island together...
- Yes?
Do you think we'd get along and talk and... things?
Sure.
Yeah, we'd get along.
It'd never be boring, I can tell you that.
It would never be boring.
Take your hat off.
If you want to.
# They call you the Bandit
I want to.
# They call you the Bandit
# They call you the Bandit... #
- No. Honey, we'll be home in a little while.
- Hey!
Is this your goddamn mutt?
Honey, I got... I gotta go.
Yeah, I gotta go... Bye.
- Yeah, that's my dog. Yeah.
- Well, he just bit me.
- Fred! Come here, Fred.
- I said... He just bit me.
- Put the son of a bitch out of his misery.
- Let's roast him.
- That's not a bad idea.
- Eat him.
I don't think Fred bit you, mister.
Fred absolutely don't like grease.
Gearjammer, huh?
King of the road, huh?
- It's time to get out.
- That's a big 10-4.
How much do I owe you, Billy?
- Never mind, just keep the change.
Sorry what happened, Snowman.
It's OK, Lamar.
Far out.
What the hell is this, a drive-in movie?
Get off of there, you schnauzer's tit!
- How do, Officer. My name's...
- I don't care if it's Broderick Crawford.
Don't you know you can't drive a piece of shit like that on the highway?
I'll thank you not to use that kind of language in my presence.
Never mind that crap.
What the hell is this?
- This is evidence.
- Evidence?
I don't care what it is. You can't drive this piece of shit on my highway.
I'm tellin' you for the last time.
I have my young son in the car, and I don't wanna hear that kinda language.
- Look! I'm askin' you one single, goddamn...
- Hold it!
Hold it!
Don't you ever, ever raise your voice to me!
Do you know who you're talkin' to?
I happen to be Buford T. Justice, a distinguished officer of over 30 years' seniority!
One of the most highly respected law-enforcement agents... in the United States of America.
That vehicle happens to be evidence, valuable evidence, that's going to convict a maniac that I've been tryin' to apprehend and that I have been in high-speed pursuit of for 700 miles.
He is wanted for the Mann Act, kidnappin' and the attempted murder of over 20 brother officers.
Sir, I'm sorry. I had no idea.
It never occurred to me... Well, please, sir, you proceed immediately, and...
I hope you'll accept my apologies for my profanity.
Apology accepted.
Now...
How about you, Bandit?
You copy this Snowman? Come on.
I got ya, son. Come on back.
You ain't gonna believe this, but I just did my imitation of Joe Palooka.
I went a few rounds with some dudes at this eat-'em-up joint.
Oh, I believe anything you tell me.
How'd ya do, same as always?
Yeah, about normal. I lost.
We also lost a lot of valuable time.
We gonna really have to cook.
- Is that a 10-4?
- That's a big 10-4.
Actually, my heaviest relationship was with an acid-rock singer... named Robert Crumly.
We were together... eight and a half days.
God, I really thought that was it.
And?
One day I came home and found him in the shower...
...with a girl... and her mother!
Well, at least he kept it in the family.
You have a wonderful way of putting things.
- So did he.
- Oh, yes.
Breaker one-nine.
This is the Bandit.
I'm lookin' for a west-bounder on highway 85.
I need a smokey report, and I need it bad, son.
This is Foxy Lady, Bandit.
We heard you were comin' by, and we decided we'd take care of those bears for you.
- You know, a little "personalised service".
- Send me the bill, Foxy Lady.
Better yet, why don't you come by and pay up in person?
I'll catch you on the flip side, darlin'.
I'm too pooped to pop.
- Daddy, listen.
- Shut up!
But I'm just ahead of you.
I'm at mile marker 86.
Come on by, Bandit.
All right, you talked me into it.
Now I got that sombitch, and I got him with his fly open.
- What do we do when we get home?
- Go to bed. For a week.
Good idea.
- And sleep.
- Wanna bet?
Orville, you seen that new waitress at the diner, Arlene?
- She's got some nice legs.
- I'd like to take a run on her.
- Oh, man, what are you talkin' about?
- I'm tellin' ya.
Let me tell you somethin' about that.
She makes herself...
- Feel lucky?
- Let's get him.
This is car four.
We're in pursuit of the black TransAm.
It's the Bandit.
# Eastbound and down loaded up and truckin'
# We gonna do what they say can't be done
# We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
# I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run #
Oh, shit.
Breaker one-nine.
Breaker one-nine.
I see a portable gas station ahead of me. Do you copy?
Is this Bandit? This is Mr B., gearjammin' this rollin' refinery. You got a smokey?
This is the Bandit, son. Can we slide right into your convoy there?
Come ahead, Bandit. We'll slip you into the rockin' chair, play a little hide-and-seek.
The welcome mat is out, and you're comin' home.
- We're going in the rocking chair, honey.
- Good.
Trucks, I love 'em. I love 'em.
This is not a convoy.
This is a dream.
- They can see right down into this car!
- Well, so what?
That's why I used to love to drive those trucks, darlin'. Spot those beavers.
- Safe as in your mother's womb, darlin'.
- Is that right?
# Son, never mind them brakes
# Let it all hang out
'cause we got a run to make
# The boys are thirsty in Atlanta and there's beer in Texarkana
# And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes
# Eastbound and down loaded up and truckin'
# We gonna do what they say can't be done
# We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
# I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run
# Old Smokey's got them ears on he's hot on your trail
# He ain't gonna rest till you're in jail
# So you gotta dodge him you gotta duck him
# You gotta keep that diesel truckin'
# Just put that hammer down and give it hell #
Thank you, Mr B.
I don't know how to thank ya.
You can thank me by not gettin' caught.
Have a good day and a better one tomorrow, good buddy.
Hey, Bandit, this is Little Beaver.
Put your foot on the floor.
We got your back door, and I'm clear.
That's a 10-4.
Snowman, you got your ears on, son?
You've got him, you lucky devil.
You're about to come up on a convoy.
Keep your rubber band stretched real tight.
I'm bringin' it, son. I'm clear.
# Eastbound and down loaded up and truckin'
# We gonna do what they say can't be done
# We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
# I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run
# Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes
# Let it all hang out
'cause we got a run to make
# The boys are thirsty in Atlanta and there's beer in Texarkana
# And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes
# Eastbound and down loaded up and truckin'
# We gonna do what they say can't be done
# We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
# I'm eastbound
Just watch ol' Bandit run #
I don't care if you're the Governor of Texas.
You're makin' a big mistake.
Read him his rights, Junior.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say may be held against you in a court of law. And...
What's all this about?
Oh, hello, Officer!
Glad you're here to assist me.
My name is Sheriff Buford T. Justice.
I have just apprehended the Bandit.
No, sir. You just apprehended my captain.
- Take the cuffs off, Junior.
- But, Daddy, we just...
Take the cuffs off, you moose twit.
May I express my feelings about inconveniencing you...
But if you gonna hang out in these kinda joints... wear a badge on your didie.
Oh, no.
Hey, Bandit. Listen to this.
You know who that is?
That's Mr Evel Knievel.
He snuck in my back door when I wasn't lookin'.
Give me a hand, or we gonna be in a heap of trouble.
- Please roger that transmission.
- Hold on to Fred. Here comes the cavalry.
- Howdy, Officer.
- How ya doin'?
Give me your licence and manifest, boy.
You know you was goin' 96 miles an hour?
- I was doin' 96...
- You're damn right, you was.
I didn't know this truck could do 96.
The judge gets to you, he's gonna turn you every way but loose.
It's time you truckers learn these roads don't belong to you.
You be careful, you hear?
- Whoa. Want a little piece of advice, Bandit?
- Yeah. Lay it on me, son.
Don't take your foot off of that hammer.
Them bears'll pour over you like maple syrup.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- Don't you know this ain't Saturday?
- Thanks a lot.
We don't need assistance.
I've got him in my sights.
Headquarters, disregard my last transmission.
Son... you reckon you can let me off at the next exit?
- Go get your daddy a beer.
- OK.
...I understand every cop in the state's after him.
- Stay 10-10. I'll let you know.
- That's a big 10-4.
Damn, he's been stirring up some trouble.
Ooh, it's the Bandit!
I'm Hot To Trot. Just tell me how
I can help and I'm with ya, body and soul.
- Channel clear.
- Breaker one-nine, breaker one-nine.
Is that Hot Pants Hilliard yakkin' out there?
- And who wants to know?
- This is the Bandit, darling.
Well, where are you, you bodied-up, smooth-talkin' thing?
And how can I help?
Bring it back.
You still workin' at that choke-and-puke on West 85?
Affirmative, affirmative.
I'm still dishin' it out.
We'll come screamin' by in five minutes with a herd of smokeys on our ass.
How 'bout gettin' those pallies of yours out there, block 'em off?
Love to! But hey, you're gonna owe me one.
- I owe you a big one.
- That's a big 10-4.
All right, gang, we're gonna go for a big smokey red 22. Wahoo!
- Ride with me?
- Yeah.
- You sure we ain't gonna get in trouble?
- Nah. I've done it before.
- We're comin' at you, darlin'. Are you ready?
- Ready, willin' and able.
"Ready and willing. " Ha.
She always was.
OK, gang, be alert,
'cause here he comes.
- Well, go ahead and answer.
- 10-4, Hot Pants. We copy.
Let go of the button.
Paydirt. I just picked up the Bandit eastbound on 95.
All units converge.
I copy, Chopper One.
I'm on my way.
Heading for the fairgrounds!
This is car 12, Bobby Lee, and I have him westbound on 75.
- Cledus, where the hell are we?
- Four miles to go, good buddy.
- Four miles. Goddamn it!
- Four miles...
Bo, did you count on this?
I mean, all of this?
No, I didn't, honey.
- Cledus?
- Talk to me, my boy.
Goddamn it, son, we gave it our best shot.
I don't like this any more than you do, but...
We ain't gonna make it, son.
We're gonna hang it up.
Whoa, negatory, negatory!
You crazy or somethin'?
We come this far, ain't we? When we say we gonna do a job, we do a job!
It's me they're after. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Oh, they don't?
Well, I'll tell you what we gonna do.
We gonna introduce 'em to the boy.
So move over, good buddy,
'cause the Snowman is comin' through.
Hold on to your ass, Fred.
Hot damn, we're gonna make it.
Move them vehicles.
We gotta get through!
Here they come!
Daddy, you're about to have your evenin' ruined for you.
- OK.
- All right.
- We're in trouble.
- I know we're in trouble.
- What time is it?
- One minute after.
- Goddamn, we're 10 minutes early.
- We're in trouble!
We need a way out of here.
We need the money.
Here's my Cadillac. That'll leave me with an even dozen. Good luck, son.
- Cledus, get the money.
- How 'bout the money?
- How 'bout double or nothin'?
- How 'bout forgettin' it?
What about double or nothin'?
You run up to Boston, bring back some clam chowder.
- You're on.
- Uh, you're on.
- In 18 hours?
- You're still on.
Y- y-you're crazy!
And I'm divorced!
And you... Ain't half bad, is it?
20 to one
I break the son of a bitch this time.
Gimme 500 on the Bandit.
Apprehend that horse ass for reckless drivin'!
- But, Daddy, he's...
- Do what I tell you, you pile of monkey nuts!
Sheriff Buford T. Justice, please.
- Who there?
- This is Bandit Darville talkin'.
Where are you, you sombitch?
Before I tell you where I am, Sheriff, there's just one thing I wanna say.
You must be part coon dog,
'cause I been chased by the best of 'em, and son, you make 'em look like they're all runnin' in slow motion.
- I just wanna say that.
- Well, thank you, Mr Bandit.
And as the pursuer, may I say you're the goddamnedest pursuee I ever pursued.
Now that the mutual bullshit is over, where are you, you sombitch?
I'm right down at the bottom of the hill.
I'm six-foot-eight, in a cowboy outfit.
I got a little pygmy standing beside me dressed like me. You can't miss me.
10-4.
Wait a minute.
Scratch that. Hold it.
I can't lie to you, Sheriff. You're too good a man. Look over your left shoulder.
Oof.
We're on our way to Boston to get some clam chowder. Bye-bye.
- No hard feelings, Junior!
- I'm not givin' up!
I'm never gonna give up!
I'll get you, you sombitch!
Daddy, wait for me! Don't leave me!

Hi, doc.
Something's wrong.
What is it?
But how did you know?
I sensed it.
I picked up your thought waves, came as fast as I could.
Doc, it's in regard to your father.
Last week he passed away down in south America in a little place called hidalgo.
Apparently, he ccntracted some rare tropical disease.
We're sorry, doc.
We all know how close you and your father were.
This morning a large
Manila envelope arrived.
It was from your father.
As far as we could determine, he mailed it on the very day he died.
Where is it?
He wrote on the envelope that its contents vvere fdr your eyes alone, so I locked it in your safe.
Shut up. You vvant to get yourself killed?
750 grains.
577 caliber, nitro express.
An elephant rifle.
Right.
I don't see a thing.
An absolute absence of ambulation.
Registering heat from a gun barrel...
From the top of that building right over there.
That's the old eastman cranmoor building.
Renny, we'll take the whizzer.
Go get it warmed up.
Check.
Monk...
You and the rest take the cord, get over there as fast as you can.
To the garage.
To the garage!
It's a good thing doc had those refractive glass windows installed.
Saved his life.
Indubitably.
From the outside everything appears to be
5 inches to the left of where it actually is.
A most fragmistatic invention.
That tower, renny.
Up there!
Watch what you're doing, stupid!
Watch out, doc.
The back door, let's try the back door.
Invidiously obstructed.
This one's locked, too.
Here, hold him for me.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Get that revclting beast avvay frcjm me.
Look here, you 5th Avenue fashion plate...
I'll take him.
O.K.
Out of my way, shyster.
It doesn't work.
There's no juice!
The stairs, let's take the stairs!
Hey, hey, wait a minute, fellas.
Hey, fellas, I can fix this in a minute.
Hey, hey, fellas!
Hey, I got the elevator vvorking.
Come on.
Aah!
Look!
One thing for sure...
He ain't no native nevv yorker.
The word is isn't.
Isn't, ain't, vvhat's the difference?
Fingers look like they've been dipped in blood.
Somebody help me turn him over.
Well, I'll be superamalgamated.
I thought I knevv the markings of every tribe on earth, but I've never seen anything like this before.
What do you make of it, doc?
There's someone in the penthouse.
Johnny, you stay with the body.
Come on.
Johnny, you going to be all right?
Ah...
Go.
Do a Barney oldfield, long tom.
Long tom, get the lights.
Stand by, monk.
We'll use the extinguisher globes.
What is it, doc?
We know that sound by now.
It means you figured cut something.
My father did not die of a tropical disease.
He was murdered.
What happened to you?
I'm... Quite copacetic.
Doc?
Holy cow, what happened here?
Oh, nothing.
Just some vipers snuck in, blevv up the safe, and burnt the papers.
Yikes.
Thank you.
'III
I vvas examining the strange markings on the dead man...
When a wall of bricks fell on me.
At least, that's what it felt like.
When I woke up...
The body was gone.
But I did find one thing.
Solid gold.
Think it has something to do vvith your father's death?
I intend to find out.
I'm leaving for hidalgo in the morning.
If you're going, I'm going, too.
So am I.
Me, too.
That's vvhy we all came in the first place...
In case you needed us.
I wish I could join you.
My company just started a nevv turnpike.
I'm in the middle of a trial.
That's just vvhat I expect from you, you pompous peacqck.
Now, hold on, monk.
None of you are obligated to go vvith me.
This is my problem.
But, doc, remember when we were all buddies fighting in the trenches?
Remember what we agreed?
I, for one, recall it perfectly.
If we ever got out alive, we'd help each other in peace as we did in war.
Lock, I appreciate your support, believe me, but now each of you has a career.
You've all risen to vvorld-vvide eminence in your chosen fields.
I can't expect you to put aside
what you worked so hard for all these years.
That's precisely the point.
Here's an indefectable opportunity to use our skills for something more important than just our own selfish gain.
Yeah.
Count us in.
Thank you, monk.
Well...
I'll see you in the morning, chief.
All right, Johnny.
Oh, Johnny...
You sure you're all right?
Oh... Supercradofolous...
Except for this goose egg on the top of my noggin.
I'll bring Johnny with me.
O.K., long tom.
Right.
I wish I could go with you, doc.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Yes. Good luck to you all.
Anyvvay, you vvon't need a lavvyer dovvn there, vvill you?
No, I wouldn't think so, ham.
Uh, we'll, uh...
We'll look after the store.
Thanks.
A glorious good morning, gentlemen.
Hi, guys.
Sure gave me a scare.
Almost dropped this box.
Vvell, I didn't expect you, but vvelcome.
Thinking it over, i came to the conclusion you might need a lawyer after all.
And an engineer, too.
Vvhat about that trial of ycurs, ham?
Oh, the heck with the trial.
I'll let my partner worry about it.
(To heck vvith the turnpike, toc), okay?
O Kay.
Let's go.
After you, gentlemen.
Let me take that.
It worked, doc!
It worked!
Well, that's that.
Sure was an expensive way to throw those mugs off our tail.
Oh, not really, monk.
Actually, that robot airplane was only made of fabric and plywood.
The dummies...
Simply dummies.
Besides, vve've vvanted to test this remote control system for some time, right, tom?
And we sure did.
Well, gentlemen, let's be on our way.
Yeah. I vvant to see vvhat that hidalgo place looks like.
Before we go...
Let us remember our code...
Let us strive every moment of our lives
(tc) Make ourselves better and better to the best of cur ability so that all may profit by it.
Let us think of the right and lend our assistance to all who may need it, with no regard for anything but justice.
Let us take what comes with a smile without loss of courage.
Let us be considerate of our country, our fellow citizens, and our associates in everything we say and do.
Let us do right to all...
And wrong no man.
Good evening.
Ah, to your health, captain seas.
Everything worked out just the way you planned it.
I wish I could believe you, borden.
I didn't think doc savage would be that easy to eliminate.
I tell you he's dead, and his gang are dead.
I blasted them out of the sky into a million bits.
You saw no parachutes, no survivors?
Aye. Not a one.
Believe me, the papers are burned, and savage and his crummy five are finished.
And, uh, molo's body?
Ah, me and cheelok, we snatched him from where he fell and dumped him into the east river.
Oh, have a drink, captain.
To poor, departed souls.
May they rest in pieces.
Heh. Ha ha ha ha...
He is telling the truth?
Absolutely.
And perhaps novv we vvill share a bit of the vvealth, won't we, sir?
You bet your life, kulkan.
Both of you.
You like money, eh?
Oh, sure, poopsie.
Well, you listen to me.
I started out in a sideshow, got into the svving of things, and made millions, but it's nothing, nothing compared to what's ahead.
Oh, ha ha ha...
Yes, I knew your father, professor savage senior, very well.
He was a good man.
We were very close friends, and his death was a personal tragedy for me.
I'm told he died of a rare tropical disease.
Yeah. The professor contracted it during his last trip into the jungles of the interior.
By the time he returned to hidalgo, red and green blotches had broken out on his skin.
Do you know of anyone who might have had reason to...
Murder my father?
On the contrary, the professor was loved and respected by the people of hidalgo.
He set up a hospital here in the capital city, established schools in rural villages, and even taught first aid and sanitation to remote tribes.
In fact, one of the tribes, out of gratitude, gave him several kilometers of their hereditary land.
Undoubtedly, the land is mosquito and snake infested jungle...
Worthless.
But it was a Sincere gesture.
May I ask a question, doc, if you don't mind?
Why, of course, ham.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
Mr. president...
Was the Grant to professor savage officially recorded?
The transfer was registered with the land recorder's office.
I remember directing him there.
May we, then, see the deed?
Of course.
Colonel Ramirez, see that the deed is brought over here at once.
Senorita flores.
This is the vvay my secretary fqund it, sekior presidente...
Empty.
The documents are gone.
Perhaps it will show up.
No, it will not.
I'm not surprised the deed is missing.
In fact, I rather expected it.
But we will not turn around and fly back to New York.
We are going to visit that tribe vvho so graciously gave that land to my father.
Now, if someone will be kind enough to explain how we get there...
Oh, well, uh...
Well, unfortunately, senor, we do not know the name of the tribe.
Uh, it could be any one of hundreds of tribes isolated in the jungle.
Of course...
I could try to locate a guide.
Uh, maybe a native vvho traveled vvith your father.
I think don rubio has a good idea.
Let him find a guide.
It, uh, it may take a few days.
We'll wait.
Ah.
In that case, i invite you all to stay at the government's residence as our most honored guests.
Thank you.
We appreciate your generosity.
This way, please.
Oh, there's just one more thing.
May I respectfully request an autopsy be performed upon my father?
Of course. If you wish.
Gracias, senor presidente.
No hay de qué, Caballero.
Yes, iam positive.
Doc savage and his men are alive.
I was with them less than an hour ago in the office of El presidente.
No, I am not dreaming!
Their photograph will be in the newspaper tomorrow.
Yes, but fortunat...
Yes, but for...
Fortunately, i think quickly!
Will you listen to me?
They are not leaving hidalgo for a fevv days, understand?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. Yeah.
I guarantee it.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Ah!
What's the matter, honey?
That...
That no-good pilot borden.
Ahh.
Ahh.
Eh...
Aah!
Ouch!
Ah!
Aah!
Ooh!
Come on! Come...
No!
Oh. Oh!
Aah!
Ow!
Ooh!
Oh.
Ohh.
Ohhh.
Ay, que guapo
a te Mira?
Si, bien.
Oye, que estan ml...
Oye!
Aye-ylll...
Que chulo.
Old doc gets the girls every time.
Yeah.
That is one good reason not to neglect daily exercise, my friends.
Singularly remarkable.
No matter where he is, no matter what he's doing, tvvo hours of exercise every day.
Now, if you'd follow doc's good example, you might lose some of that ugly fat and start to resemble a human being instead of a clumsy baboon.
Stop where you are, you swine, or you'll be crisp bacon for breakfast tomorrow morning.
You touch one hair on that piglet, and I'll crisp your bacon!
Hold him!
Monk.
Huh?
You know ham wouldn't hurt a fly.
His svvord vvill only put you to sleep for avvhile.
Come on.
May I?
Oh.
Thank you.
Juan Lopez morales is my name.
I am the coroner of hidalgo.
Oh, I see.
Let me get a towel.
Well?
Hey, fellas, look.
Could be trouble.
And the autopsy disclosed a residue of some strange substance.
Ah, Mr. Mayfair.
I recognize you from the picture in time magazine.
Very happy to meet you...
Such a famous authority in the field of analytic chemistry.
Everything all right?
Certainly.
Senor morales here is the coroner of hidalgo.
Oh.
So, you liked my picture, huh?
He didn't say he liked it.
He said he saw it.
Senor morales was just giving me the report on the autopsy.
Yes, I was saying that in the skin tissue of professor savage's hands and face a residue of some foreign substance vvas detected.
And I must confess, I have not been able to identify it.
Did you bring the slides?
Indeed.
I anticipated you and Mr. savage might want to study them yourselves.
Gustavo.
Doc, what's going on?
Don't come in here.
Stay where you are.
Shh. Doc's inside.
I thought I heard...
Shh. We all did.
Hey, doc.
Doc.
Everything o.K., doc?
Hey, doc!
Is anything wrong, doc?
Doo!
Doo?
We'll come m, doc, all right?
Doc, is everything all right?
Yeah.
I heard a shot.
What happened, doc?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Hello.
How do you do,
Mr. savage?
Oh, I'm not doc.
My name's monk.
Uh, lieutenant colonel andrevv blodgett Mayfair at your service.
I'm one of doc savage's assistants.
Is there anything I can do to help, miss, uh...
Karen.
I'm Karen and she's Adriana.
Well, lovely ladies, what can I do to help you?
We're friends of captain seas.
He read in the newspapers about Mr. savage and his friends staying in hidalgo for a few days.
(So, he asked us tc) Personally invite all of you to dinner on his yacht.
Oh.
That's very nice.
But who's captain seas?
He's a very rich man.
He owns that big yacht just outside the bay.
Boy. Wait till you see it.
The captain would be extremely honored.
He's most anxious to meet the famous doc savage and his amazing men.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry, but doc ain't got no free time at the moment.
Why don't you come back in a week or so, okay?
Captain seas will be so disappointed.
Ah, I'm sorry.
Maybe then...
In a couple weeks.
Please tell captain seas we'd be delighted.
Ohh.
I presume you lovely ladies will be present also.
Oh, swell.
Welcome, savage.
Proud to have you aboard.
Good evening, captain seas.
Good evening, ladies.
Hello,
Mr. savage.
Hello, colonel Mayfair.
So nice to see both of you.
Oh. So many of you...
And all so handsome.
Hot sarsaparilla.
Savage...
This way, please.
Thank you.
I've heard a great deal about you.
Scientist, explorer, inventor, criminologist.
Some people even say you're a magician...
At least when it comes to remarkable escapes.
Holy cow.
What a plum-dingy yacht this is.
A necessity...
Uh, not a luxury.
Oh.
Oh, please, make yourself comfortable.
Sit down, gentlemen.
Thank you.
It serves as my permanent home as well as my business headquarters.
Just what is your business, captain seas?
It changes from day to day...
But basically, what I do is recognize opportunities and seize them.
That vvhy they call you captain seas?
Ha ha ha ha.
Very good. Very good.
Ha ha ha ha.
No.
I've made so many voyages to all corners of the world, that I adopted the name seas.
S...
E...
A...
S-
My real name is absolutely unpronounceable.
Champagne?
No, thank you.
Perhaps something a bit more potent...
Scotch, vodka, bourbon?
I'll have a coke, please.
And, uh, you gentlemen?
Same for me.
I think I'd prefer a lemonade.
Yeah, me, too.
Yeah, make mine a...
Root beer.
Uh, if it's not too exiguous a request...
Could I have a glass of milk?
Ew.
Tell me, savage, what brings you and your friends to the Republic of hidalgo?
Very few people even know of its existence.
My father passed away in hidalgo.
We came to pay our last respects.
I'm truly sorry.
My deepest sympathies.
Chow!
I mean...
Dinner is served.
What a meal.
You mind if I loosen my belt?
You'll have to forgive my friend.
As a child, he vvas so busy studying chemistry, he never learned any manners.
Please, please. I'm sure my chef vvould take it as a compliment.
Uh, cigar?
No, thank you.
Cigarette?
Thank you, no.
Oh, I should've guessed.
You and your friends don't smoke either.
I'll have one, if I may.
Why, yes, of course.
Thank you.
Uh, light?
Oh, no thanks. I...
I have one of my own.
Uh, Karen...
Adriana.
If you'll excuse us, gentlemen.
So nice to have made your acquaintance.
Oh. You men...
Always talking business.
Toodle-oo.
Toodle-oo.
To tell the truth...
I didn't think we'd ever meet.
I rather assumed we would.
Ha ha ha.
You are indeed a most unusual man.
You know...
Under different circumstances, we possibly could've become friends, since we're both adventurers...
Each in our own way.
But circumstances are not different.
Anyway,
I'm glad you enjoyed your dinner.
Because it was your last.
And you, sir.
Enjoy your last cigarette.
Ooh!
Aah!
Come on!
Come on!
Let's get out.
Aah!
Come on. This way.
Holy cow.
Into the drink!
Searchlights!
Hold your fire!
What happened to them?
Move out the ship.
Lam sorry, senor savage, but there is no yacht such as the one you have described.
You, yourself, heard vvhat the harbor master said.
My patrol boats, too, searched the bay...
The whole area...
For hours...
And found nothing.
But we don't give up.
Our men are still out there...
Looking.
To the residence.
Can't we have lunch first in a nice little cantina?
Do what you like, monk.
Take me to the land recorder's office, if you vvill.
But senor...
Yes, senor.
Vamanos!
No, no.
If you behave like a pig, no lunch.
May I help you?
Why, I believe so.
My name is Clark savage junior, and I was hoping...
Yes, I recognize you.
You are the son of professor savage.
That's right.
I am sorry.
He was a very fine man.
Thank you.
Um, is senor gorro in?
No, he is out for lunch, but he will be back soon if you would like to wait.
Uh, senorita, may i ask you a question?
Yes, of course.
Well, now, would you have any idea of what might have happened to the, uh, deed my father registered at this office?
It's a complete mystery, senor.
I met your father when he came here with the deed and a map.
We made copies of these documents, and we sent them to you in New York.
Didn't you receive them?
There was a fire.
They vvere destroyed before i had a chance to read them.
But if there are no records, that is terrible.
Well, now, you handled the documents.
Yes.
Is there anything you can remember about them?
Oh, yes.
It is very strange, senor.
The deed was signed by the chief of the quetzamal tribe, but there is no quetzamal tribe.
According to the history books, it became extinct 500 years ago, disappearing into the jungle without a trace.
But the deed is a trace.
The map is a trace.
I said according to the history books.
When I was a child, i lived in a small village far away in the mountains.
The old people there used to tell strange stories of the quetzamals.
They said they still existed not very far away, but we could never go to their place because it was over the edge of the world.
Can you believe this?
Yes.
Yes, I think I can.
My father got there.
Somehow, I must get there, too.
You know, I was planning on returning to my village in a few months...
But perhaps I can leave now and guide you there.
Do you mean that?
Yes, absolutely.
When would you like to go?
Vvell, do you think you could be ready to leave...
In the morning?
Yes.
Miss, uh...
My name is Mona flores.
You may call me Mona.
You may call me doc.
Yes.

It's just that I heard there was some kind of problem last night.
No.
No problem whatsoever.
Adios, don rubio.
Flores!
I've taken care of everything...
Personally.
Good.
I can't understand it.
You had 'em right in your hands, and you let 'em escape.
I mean, I thought you said you had everything taken...
Shut up!
Ye-yes, sir.
They... they'll never find the place.
Only those two know the way.
That dirty little tramp in my office, she could never lead them to quetzamal.
That's what I'm counting on.
Lots of money is at stake.
Uh, talking about lots of money,
I could use a little money.
Maybe a small advance on my share, por favor?
Don't bother me now.
Uh, but sir, don't I deserve a little consideration?
I mean, after all now, i was the one who brought the deed and the map to your attention.
Uh, we are partners, are we not?
When savage is out of the way, that's when we'll settle accounts.
Any objections?
No, sir. little touch there.
Little stir.
No two ways about it,

Super chef.

It's all right.

Moocho Garcia, me, too.
Delicious, delicious.
No, no, no.
It is only a story, a legend.
There is no such a place as quetzamal.
But don Jose, my grandfather once told me that you and he made a trip there when you were very young boys.
I never been to quetzamal, only to the edge of the world.
Don Jose...
Do you think you could lead us there?
It's very important.
Por favor.
Please.
Very well, but only as a favor to Mona because I know her since she was such a little senorita.
Ah, thank you.
Come back here tomorrow at dawn.
Gracias, senor.
Gracias.
Adios.
Adios.
We need more horses, and we must have food from the village.
That's all been taken care of.
But it may take days to get there.
You've brought us this far, Mona, and I thank you, but it would be wrong to expose you to any more danger on our account.
But I want to go with you.
I'm not afraid, doc.
Well, I know you're not...
But for your own safety,
I think it's best you remain here, this village with your own people.
No.
I love you.
Ah, there's no room in my life for love, Mona.
But why, doc?
There was a girl once.
We were to be married.
She was kidnapped by the men i had been pursuing.
They threatened to kill her if I didn't drop the chase.
I gave in.
I had to.
Later, when she was returned safely to me,
I realized there could never be a future for us.
I realized if I were to do what I had chosen with my life, there could never be a loved one who could be used against me...
Or harmed because of me.
Do you understand?
I suppose so.

Here it is, the edge of the world.
Below in the valley of the vanished, live the quetzamals.
There is no way down.
And now adios, amigos.
I must return.
Vaya con dios!
Remember me to Mona!
I will!
There must be a way down.
My father found it.
Vvell, let's look for it.
Doc!
These rocks.
Unordinary divarication.
Right.
What ls it, doc?
It's a message...
From my father.
"La-too-ah...
Spin-oh-sa."
La-too-ah-spin-oh-sa.
Who's he?
He ain't a he.
It's an it, Harvard man, a rare semi-tropical bush, see?
Neh!
Gentlemen, my father was right.
Bring the horses.
Whoa!
You all right, monk?
Yeah, I'm o.K.
Johnny?
Jupiter, what a phenomenosity!
It's gold.
A pool of gold.
Gentlemen, I think
I'll go scout around.
You remain here.
Sure thing, doc.
Take care.
Don't worry.
Gee...
Those are captain seas' men storing gold in that hut.
Get in there.
Keep quiet.
Put your hands up!
Up! Up!
Get moving!
I say!
It's deplorable!
Hurry up.
I'm a lawyer.
I'll sue you for this.
Simply deplorable.
Horrible.
I followed you.
I wanted to be with...
I'm sorry.
Get moving.
My compliments, gentlemen.
You have eluded me at every turn.
You have even managed to find the pool of gold, but this time, there is no escape.
Mr. seas...
As the representative of Clark savage Jr.,
I must vehemently protest in his absence and warn you that your actions are contradictory to the existing lavvs of the United States, as well as the Republic of hidalgo.
Heh heh heh!
You don't say?
You are not only trespassing on my client's legal property, duly registered vvith the land recorder's office of hidalgo, but you are also unlawfully exploiting his inheritance, as vvell as the labor of the natives of this tribe.
This is the law here,
Harvard man.
The law of the jungle.
You dirty skunk!
Hyah!
Yes! Get him!
You!
Get rid of them right now!
Get rid of them, I said!
I will prepare the potion.
No, kulkan.
The green death is a heritage from our ancestors, only to defend ourselves against our enemies.
It has not been used for hundreds of years.
You do not understand.
Captain seas is our friend.
His enemies are our enemies.
You are deserting your own people.
You are joining with strangers who have taken away our freedom.
Shut up, you old fool.
I told you I'd make you rich, didn't I?
Wealth means nothing to us.
Put him with the others.
Take them away!
Now get savage.
He can't be far away.
Arankanalla!
Arankanalla!
Areeabooboo!
Areeabooboo!
That vvas truly noble of you, monk, vvhat you did.
I want you to know that I appreciate it.
That's okay.
Anytime.
You ccjuld have been killed, you knovv.
Oh, uh, well, anything for a pal.
Say, chief, hovv come you speak such good English?
Professor savage saw to that.
Mmmi what happens now?
We're all doomed to die...
A horrible death.
This place gives me the heebie-jeebies.
We got to bust out of here.
An unconfuted veracity, but how, may I ask, with our hands tied behind our backs and locked in this...
That's it!
That's it!
Untie me.
If only they hadn't taken my sword cane away.
If I had my thingamajig...
An unravelable configuration of knots.
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
I got a idea!
Habeas corpus!
Sorry, ham. I know you don't like that name.
Oh, that's all right...
Pal.
H.C., you still in my pocket?
Well, get out and do that trick I taught you.
Good boy, habeas!
Well done!
Well, come on, monk.
Hurry up and untie me.
Come on, fellas.
Let's move that rock and fight our way out.
Yeah. Fight our way out!
Whoa!
Aah!
Heh heh heh!
Perfect, kulkan.
Perfect.
They're finished, just like that old professor and that liar of a pilot.
Heh heh heh heh!
Aah!
Aah!
And we have the papers, the deed, and the pool of gold.
Right. Now only savage remains.
Uhh!
Tell your men to stand back, drop their guns.
Have no fear!
Doc savage is here!
Now tell your men to open this cave.
Tell them to open the cave, or you're a dead man in five seconds.
Open the cave!
Arankanalla!
Hypodermic. Antidote.
Inject yourself, then inject the others.
Hyah!
Uhh!
The... the green death!
Aah!
Oh! Uhh! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Rahhr!
Rahhr!
Rahhr!
Ah!
Hyah!
Aah!
Heh heh heh heh!
Ah! Ah! Ow!
Ow! Ow!
Ooh!
No! Stop!
Stop!
Thieves!
You won't get away with this!
It belongs to me and the captain!
It's my gold!
It's mine!
Come back, I say!
Hy...
Aaah!
You won't get away with this!
Come back!
Come back!
Come back, you!
Ooh!
Everyone all right?
You're a sight for sore eyes.
It's my gold!
The gold is mine!
What the devil's going on?
That dynamite must have triggered an eruptiqn.
Mother nature aroused, seeking revenge.
Come back!
Sure you're okay?
Yes, I'm fine, doc, but...
Marks on your face are going away.
How do you feel?
I feel better.
Thanks, monk.
Yes.
How about you?
Fine.
The epicenter is quite near.
There should be one more brief disturbance about...
Now.
Whoa!
Habeas!
Come back here!
Habeas corpus, come back here!
You son of a pig!
Come back, i tell ya!
Good boy.
Good piggy.
Nice piggy.
May I?
Cute piggie.
Help!
Help?
Strange how history repeats itself.
First, your father saved us against the plague.
Then you came, my son, to save us from slavery.
We gave him, as an expression of gratitude, the pool of gold.
Now the land and the gold belong to you, doc savage.
Thank you, chief chaac.
I promise to continue my father's work...
His ideals.
With this limitless wealth at my disposal,
I shall be able to devote my life to the cause of justice.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, doc.
I will stay here, and then I vvill return to my village to help my people.
Will you come back...
Someday?
I'm sure I will...
Someday.
Are you going to kill me now?
No. Doc don't believe in killing, not even crooks like you.
He's got his own methods of dealing with them.
What methods?
Well, first we're going to take you to a place in upper
New York state, where doc has his own rehabilitation center.
There, doc vvill perform a special kind of acupuncture surgery on your brain, which will help rid you of your evil nature.
He learned about this kind of stuff in a remote monastery on his last trip to China, you see.
(You're also going tc) Be taught good citizenship and an honest trade, then one day, you'll leave the center completely vvell and become a respectable member of society.
Thanks.
Thank you, young man.
Merry Christmas to you!

- Engine room, chief still there?
- Yes, sir.
- It's the captain, put him on.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Are you making contact?
- Yeah, I'm making contact.
Chief, the captain wants you on the phone.
Chief here, go ahead.
What's going on? Anything more you can do with the stabilizers?
There's nothing wrong with the stabilizers.
Besides, my hands are full with this pump!
You know what the trouble is.
It's that bastard Linarcos.
Care to repeat yourself?
He's standing right here.
Good, I hope he heard me!
All right, Joe, do the best you can until we clear this weather.
- Where the devil did you come from?
- From my cabin, sir.
Don't you realize it's dangerous out there?
You said come up anytime.
Robin Shelby...
...remember?
You picked a particularly fascinating moment to come here.
The waves don't bother you?
I've surfed up to 18 feet.
- But these look more like 30.
- Thirty-five to be exact.
Some get up to 300.
- I find 60 about maximum. Steady up.
- Steady up, sir.
- Bring her up.
- Bring her up, sir.
Hang on!
- All lifelines rigged?
- All except C deck, sir.
When I order all lifelines rigged it includes C deck. See to it.
Wow, surf's really up.
- Master Shelby.
- Yes, sir?
We'll continue our discussion another time. Fair enough?
Aye, aye, sir.
That last one almost broached us, Linarcos.
I warned you. We should've loaded extra bunkers in Gibraltar.
We are top-heavy and when that pump is repaired...
...I am taking on more ballast.
- Where next?
- Mr. and Mrs. Rogo, M45.
- Yeah?
- I'm Dr. Caravello. You asked for me.
All morning.
- You the only doctor on this tub?
- The only ship doctor.
What if somebody was dying?
Oh, my God, who's not dying?
Most of the passengers are sick, Mr. Rogo.
We have to take them in rotation.
Use one of these now, another in 8 hours...
...and remain in bed until the sea is calm.
Hold it, hold it.
You mean we had to wait all this time for you to come...
...and give her some pills?
And some crap about staying in bed?
How do you know she's just seasick?
Look at her!
It could be something else.
You didn't even examine her.
Oh, shoot me, Mike.
For chrissake, just shoot me.
You see how sick she is?
I'll tell you what this is.
It's food poisoning, that's what.
How is she gonna swallow pills when she can't even swallow water?
They're suppositories, Mr. Rogo.
You...
...don't swallow them.
What do you do with them?
I know what to do with suppositories.
Just get them out of here!
Oh, hon....
Nurse, I think we should continue with our rounds.
I still think it's food poisoning.
Oh, shut up.
- Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Rosen.
- Good morning.
Don't fall over.
- That Martin, he's crazy.
- I like that man.
Of course you like him.
He runs on time like a train.
You and trains.
When, in my whole life, did I ever run for a train?
Who cried for a week when they tore down the 3rd Avenue El?
Yeah.
He's lonely.
That's why he runs, so you won't notice.
Says here there's a package tour to the mountain...
...where Moses received the Ten Commandments.
No.
When we finally get to Israel, we're gonna stay put, no traveling.
We're gonna get to know our grandson.
Just think, he's 2 years old already.
He's talking.
We've never even seen him.
Get down on your knees and pray to God for help...
...and then maybe everything will work out?
Garbage.
Not where I come from.
You could wear off your knees praying to God for heat in February.
And icicles would grow from your upraised palms.
If you're freezing, you burn the furniture...
- ...but you get off your knees.
- Somewhat unorthodox, Reverend Scott.
But realistic.
John, the church is for more than prayer.
With those sermons, it's a wonder you're still ordained.
- Or are you?
- The best kind.
Angry, rebellious, critical, a renegade...
...stripped of most of my so-called clerical powers.
But I'm still in business.
- You seem to enjoy the punishment.
- Punishment?
The church has blessed me.
Banished to a new country in Africa.
Hell, I had to look it up on a map.
My bishop doesn't know, but he's given me exactly what I wanted:
Elbow room. Freedom!
Real freedom. Freedom to dump all the rules and all the trappings.
And freedom to discover God in my own way.
I’d better be going.
I'll see you later.
John.
Still want me to give that sermon this afternoon?
Well, one thing's for sure:
Nobody will sleep through it.
The weather report, sir.
"Weather moderate to the southeast.
Barometer 1016 millibars.
Smooth seas, clear skies. " Good.
Keep her on slow, start taking on ballast.
Aye, sir.
Full ahead, captain.
As I've told you, we don't have enough ballast yet to run full ahead.
I suggest we talk privately.
Linus, start taking on ballast.
I did not suggest full ahead, captain.
As the new owner's representative...
- ...I ordered it.
- Damn it, man...
...the Poseidon is too fine a lady to be rushed to the junkyard.
We're three days behind schedule and it's costing thousands of dollars...
...to maintain a wrecking crew.
We dock Monday!
I can't gamble with my passengers' lives!
Your business is to deliver this ship when and where we want it.
An unstable ship at full ahead is dangerous. Especially one this old.
I'm sure I don't have to remind you of my right to relieve your command.
Three other officers have their master's license.
Now, order full ahead.
You irresponsible bastard.
Full ahead!
Aye, aye, sir.
Where did they come from?
They boarded at Gibraltar.
They're on their way to Sicily.
A free trip for free music.
They're going to a jazz festival.
Morning after
I can't take this.
Give me a Strauss waltz.
I rather fancy it.
You? You even fancy bagpipes.
Hey, did you know this?
The engines on this ship have more total horsepower...
...than all the cavalry Napoleon used to conquer Europe.
How about that?
That's heavy, Robin, real heavy.
The generator creates enough electricity...
...to light Charleston, South Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia.
- Shelby?
- That's right.
- Cable.
- Thank you.
- It's my turn to open the cable.
- Don't be so childish.
"Mother and I waiting impatiently your arrival.
Our thoughts and our love with you on this New Year's Eve. Dad."
- We should've sent them a wire.
- I did.
Why didn't you ask me for my ideas?
I mean, what to put in it.
Why don't I have a brother who's easier to live with?
- Stop jumping and go take a shower.
- I'm going to the engine room.
- You're going to church.
- On vacation?
- Will you get in that bathroom?
- I want to see the propeller shaft.
- You'll see the propeller shaft later.
- Why don't you shove it?
Don't you ever say that to me again.
Shove it, shove it, shove it.
God is pretty busy.
He has a plan for humanity that stretches beyond our comprehension.
So we can't expect Him to concern
Himself with the individual.
The individual is important only to the extent...
...of providing a creative link between the past and the future...
...in his children, or in his grandchildren...
...or his contributions to humanity.
Therefore, don't pray to God to solve your problems.
Pray to that part of God within you.
Have the guts to fight for yourself.
God wants brave souls.
He wants winners, not quitters.
If you can't win, at least try to win.
God loves tryers.
- Isn't that right, Robin?
- Right.
So, what resolution should we make for the New Year?
Resolve to let God know that you have the guts to do it alone!
Resolve to fight for yourselves and for others...
...and for those you love.
That part of God within you will be fighting with you...
...all the way.
Do you know what it means to be picked out from all the passengers...
...to sit at the captain's table on New Year's Eve?
I'll tell you one thing it means.
That your worries about other women looking down on you is bull.
He only invited us because you're a detective lieutenant.
Why don't you just go without me?
What should I do at midnight, kiss the captain?
Don't knock it.
Why don't you admit the real reason?
You're still afraid some bum will recognize you.
That's pretty stupid!
You're out of that business now.
You're my wife.
You can't go around afraid all the time...
...that every guy you bump into is a former customer!
Linda, you hear me?
Will you shut up? I'm busy in here!
You weren't on the streets that long!
How many guys did you know?
You realize how slim the chances are...
...that even one of these characters is on this boat?
You don't have to shout.
I said...
I said, do you realize how slim...
I heard what you said!
Mike.
I saw a young officer on deck the other day.
And he looked pretty damn familiar.
Even with his clothes on.
So he recognized you.
So?
Doesn't that bother you?
If it bothered me, I wouldn't have married you.
Well, first you arrested me six times!
I had to keep you off the streets until you'd marry me!
Come here, you lousy cop.
Belle.
Mr. Martin, what is the little green one for?
That's alfalfa, Mrs. Rosen.
It's essential to blood formation, neural function and growth.
The growth part doesn't work.
At least not with me anyway.
And the yellow one?
That's very attractive.
A tocopherol, derived from seed germ oil.
- It looks like vitamin E to me.
- It is, Mr. Rosen.
Doesn't that increase virility?
That's the rumor.
All you need is a pretty wife.
I think I've been a bachelor too long.
Sure, you're too busy taking all those pills.
There she goes.
My wife can't stand seeing anyone who's not married.
No.
- It comes from caring.
- I'd like to be married, Mrs. Rosen.
I just can't seem to find the time.
I mean, I get down to the shop at 8, I open at 9.
I close at 7 and go home at 8.
Except on Wednesdays and Fridays,
I go home at 10.
Mrs. Rosen, when you see your grandson...
...tell him not to become a haberdasher.
I know what you mean.
We never went to Coney Island until we sold our business last year.
You see?
Mr. Tinkham, are you married?
No marriage for me, Mrs. Rosen.
I've got a mistress.
- What?
- The sea.
Hey, that's good!
From the seismographic station in Athens, sir.
"Sub-sea earthquake,
7.8 on the Richter scale.
Epicenter 130 miles northwest of Crete."
That's the cat this ship is named after?
That's right, the great god, Poseidon.
In Greek mythology, the god of the seas, storms, tempests...
...earthquakes and other miscellaneous natural disasters.
Quite an ill-tempered fellow.
- Yes?
- Sorry to disturb you, captain.
- Please come to the bridge.
- Right.
Would you all excuse me, please?
Duty calls.
Reverend, do you mind taking over as host?
- Glad to.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Acres.
- Oh, by the way, happy New Year!
- Thank you, sir.
Where you two heading?
Oh, Napoli, Roma, Venezia...
And don't forget Torino.
It's the first vacation we've had since we got married.
And why we didn't fly,
I'll never know.
Well, since I'm in charge,
I'm gonna propose a toast.
Great. What will we drink to?
To love.
Hear, hear.
To love.
To love.
- To love, dummy.
- Oh.
Tell me, sir, just what does a purser do?
In spite of what you may have heard, he really runs the ship.
Not the captain, the purser.
You see, the Poseidon isn't really a ship.
It's a hotel with a bow and a stern stuck on...
...and I'm the hotel manager.
Susan, would you like to dance?
- Hello, Susan?
- Hey, Sis!
I was just asking if you'd like to dance.
Yes, I'd like to.
That's a frightening target, sir, and getting closer.
Seismographic station, Athens, sir.
This is Captain Harrison,
S. S. Poseidon.
Can you give me any further reading on that seaquake near Crete?
This is Athens. Epicenter 130 miles northwest of Crete.
Duration 42 seconds.
One aftershock, 3. 6 on the Richter scale, duration 10 seconds.
First reports indicate a major bottom displacement...
...and heavy swell conditions building to the northeast, over.
This is the Poseidon. Thank you for the information. Out.
- Are we all battened down?
- Tight as a button, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please.
It is exactly 50 seconds to midnight.
Will you all please stand and fill your glasses?
Mr. Martin, don't be by yourself tonight.
Come, stand next to me.
Come on.
Ladies and gentlemen, silence.
Quiet, quiet, please.
Ten seconds, nine...
...eight, seven...
...six, five...
...four, three, two, one.
Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!
It seems to be piling up in those shallows.
- By the way, happy New Year.
- Thank you, sir, same to you.
- What's its speed?
- Sixty knots, sir.
It must be mountainous.
- Lookout, see anything?
- Nothing, sir.
- Radar target port bow. Keep watch.
- Yes, sir.
Get my binoculars.
Captain.
Lookout.
- What is it, lookout?
- On the port bow...
I never saw anything like it. An enormous wall of water coming at us.
Oh, my God.
- Hard left!
- Hard left, sir.
Close all watertight doors!
Sound boat stations.
What the hell is happening?
- Sparks.
- Yes, sir.
Send a mayday.
- Mayday, sir?
- Yes, I said, mayday, mayday.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is S. S. Poseidon calling.
Manny! Manny!
Manny! Manny! No, Manny!
Manny!
Hold on, Linda!
- Manny.
- Belle.
- What?
- Belle.
Oh, Manny!
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
- You're not hurt?
- No, I don't think so.
- Jesus Christ, what happened?
- We've turned over.
- It's okay.
- Linda?
- Linda, honey, you all right?
- Hi.
- Where the hell have you been?
- Where do you think?
Flying around on my ass.
Please...
...help me.
Help me, please.
Teddy?
Ted?
Must go to the lifeboat stations.
Soon. Very soon.
Please...
...go to the lifeboat stations.
Listen to me, everybody!
I want you all to stay where you are.
Help will be here any minute.
This ship is equipped with watertight compartments.
So just remain calm.
Keep your positions.
Help is on the way.
- Sis!
- Help is on the way.
Susan!
Susan!
- Robin, are you all right?
- Yes, sir. I'm all right.
- But I can't...
- Robin?
Reverend Scott.
Can you help me?
What are you doing up there, Sis?
That's a stupid question!
- Are you hurt?
- I don't think so.
Just stay perfectly still.
You wait right here.
It'll be all right.
Hold on, Sis.
Over here, everybody!
Listen to me, give me some help.
Gather around.
Pull it tight. Let's make a net.
Tuck it down tight.
All right, boys. Pull it tight.
That's it.
All right, hold on.
Come on, Susan!
Jump, we'll catch you!
I can't!
Don't be afraid! Jump!
Trust us!
Come on, you can make it, Sis!
Come on and jump, Susan!
You can make it.
Susan, you can do it.
Now, come on.
- It's a cinch. Come on!
- That's it, keep coming. Come on.
Come on, jump!
Sis!
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Sis!
- Okay.
Listen to me, everybody!
Listen to me, please!
Please stay where you are!
Reverend Scott?
- Who is it?
- It's me, sir, Acres.
Could you help me down?
I've injured my leg.
Hang on, we'll get you down.
Grab that.
Pull it out. Grab hold.
Excuse me, Reverend, my name's James Martin.
- Isn't it better to go up?
- What do you mean?
It seems that any rescue would have to come through the hull.
- The hull? You mean the bottom?
- My God, that's right.
We're upside down.
We've got to go up.
Acres, where's that lead to?
To the galley, sir.
- You stay there, we're coming up.
- Wait.
How do you figure going through the bottom?
It's solid steel.
Aft, sir, at the outlet of the propeller shaft.
Kid, this isn't some toy boat, so you let us figure it out, huh?
I'm sorry, sir, but Charley, the third engineer...
...he told me that by the shaft, the hull was only one-inch thick.
Look, do you know how thick one inch of steel is?
It's one inch less than two inches.
We're climbing up! All of us!
Is there a ladder there, or something we can climb with?
No, sir, this is the linen service area.
- Tablecloths?
- Yes, sir.
- We can knot them together.
- Wouldn't be strong enough.
What we need is a...
Something like that, the Christmas tree.
- Come on, give me a hand.
- No.
- You gonna give us a hand?
- No. Didn't you hear the purser?
He said to stay put and keep calm.
Help will be here.
- I'm staying right here.
- There he goes. That's my old man.
- Linda.
- Everything by the book!
- You stay the hell out of this!
- You get your ass with us, mister.
Hey...
...watch your language, preacher.
You sound like you come from the slum!
You son of a bitch, go help him!
Okay, okay.
Who the hell does he think he is?
Clear the way!
Come on, clear the way!
We're gonna lift on three.
Get over.
One! Two...
For God's sake, Reverend, that's suicide!
We're cut off from the world.
Maybe we can get to them.
- Now, get out of the way.
- Pray for us but don't do this!
Climbing up will kill you all!
Sitting on our butts isn't gonna help us either!
Maybe by climbing up we can save ourselves.
You got any sense, you'll come too.
Grab hold. On three! One!
Two! Up!
Holy mackerel, it's heavy.
All right, forward!
Hold it!
Let's upend it.
Bring it up to your waist.
Stand by, Acres!
Good for you, Mr. Rosen.
All right, come on, everybody! Push!
- Come on, push!
- Get the bottom!
- Anchor the bottom!
- Keep it up now!
- Put some muscle into it!
- Be careful there.
- Keep it straight!
- All the way up!
All right, Reverend.
- Come on, push!
- Come on!
- Come on, Rogo!
- Catch it, hold it!
Don't let it tip over!
- Good. Easy.
- That's it.
That's it. Acres, watch out.
- Stand clear.
- We did it.
Acres, can you anchor it up there?
- Yeah, I think so, sir.
- Good man.
- Mr. Rosen.
- Yeah?
Get your wife.
- Are you all fixed up there, Acres?
- Yes, sir.
Let's start climbing up.
I need a monkey.
- Are you game?
- Yes, sir!
Good boy.
Climb up inside as far as you can go.
Then come out and Mr. Acres will give you a hand, okay?
No sweat.
It's a cinch! Come on!
- Now the rest of us.
- So you get us up there, then what?
Through the kitchen and deeper until we reach the hull.
That way.
Then you kick out the bottom and swim ashore, huh?
Or yell, "This is the police," and it'll open up.
- Don't be a smart-ass.
- Susan, you're first.
You can't climb in a gown, so it'll have to come off. Okay?
Go up the same way Robin did...
- ...and don't look down.
- Okay.
Excuse me, Reverend, what about all those other people?
I'll keep them moving.
Try and get the others to join.
Okay, Miss Rogo, up you go.
- You have to take off the gown.
- Like hell she will!
- She can't climb in that, too tight.
- She's got nothing under it!
Just panties. What else do I need?
What do you mean, what else?
- Give her your shirt.
- My...
Come on.
Linda...
...next time you put something on like I told you to put on.
- How you coming, Susan?
- All right!
Good girl.
Ladies and gentlemen, there's very little time.
Please, everybody, you heard what the reverend said...
...he's taking us up to the engine room.
- Please, everyone, come this way.
- Mr. Martin!
- We're staying right here.
- Can't you see the logic?
- What are you doing?
- I want you...
...to give this to our little grandson, huh?
Why? I'm going somewhere you're not?
- Tell me something, Manny.
- What is it now?
How long you think since we told each other "I love you"?
Who knows?
Twenty years?
Yesterday?
I love you.
Not many people have had that.
Put it back on. You'll give it to him yourself.
- No.
- Mrs. Rosen...
...we have to go right now.
Mr. Scott, a fat woman like me can't climb.
- I'll wait here with the others.
- I'm afraid I can't allow that.
Listen to him, Belle.
There's something different up there than there is down here?
Yes.
Life.
Life is up there.
And life always matters very much...
...doesn't it?
Yes.
All right, so I'll climb.
Please, Ted.
You've got to wake up.
We've got something we've got to do.
You know how disorganized I am without you.
- Wake up.
- Miss?
Miss?
I think you should come with me.
Leave him?
Oh, I can't.
I can't leave my brother.
He's all I've got.
What's your name?
Nonnie.
Nonnie...
...your brother's dead.
Did you like his music?
I would have danced to it...
...if I'd had somebody to dance with.
Come, please.
Come with me. Please.
- Come on, Belle.
- I can't!
You can. It's just a little higher.
I can't, Manny, I'm stuck.
I'm stuck in the spokes!
- Yes, you can.
- I can't, Manny!
I can't!
What's happening? What is that?
What's down there?
Good girl.
- Excuse me for getting so familiar.
- What else could you do?
Mrs. Peter Pan, I'm not.
All right, Belle, let's get up.
Come on, come on.
That's it. There we go.
You ready?
- Follow her.
- Wait a minute.
- Don't you ever say "please"?
- If it'll get you up that tree...
...please.
This is Nonnie, she's coming with us.
- What about the others?
- Nobody will listen.
They have more confidence in the purser than in us.
You help her up, Mr. Martin, and then you follow her.
You didn't say what you thought of my sermon.
- You didn't ask me.
- I'm asking you now.
You spoke only for the strong.
I'm asking you to be strong.
Come with us.
I can't leave these people.
I know I can't save them.
I suspect we'll die...
...but I can't leave them.
They don't want to go.
They've chosen to stay.
Why should you?
What good's your life then?
What's it all been for?
I have no other choice.
John, I'm not gonna give up.
Can I have your attention?
May I have your attention, please?
That's the way out.
- That's our only chance.
- Don't listen to him!
- We must stay until help arrives.
- Help from where?
From the captain? He's dead.
Everyone above us before the ship turned over is dead.
Because now they're under the water.
- That's not true!
- It is true, you pompous ass!
There's nobody alive but us!
And nobody's going to help us except ourselves.
It's up to each one of you.
It's up to all of us. Together.
Now, for God's sake, come with me.
I order you not to go!
He knows nothing about this ship.
- He's right.
- Mind your own business!
- God bless.
- God bless you.
Here, sir. Here, sir.
Here you are.
- I appeal to you for the last time.
- You don't know what you're saying!
I know this much:
The sea will keep pouring in.
We'll keep settling deeper.
We may even go under...
...before we cut our way out.
But it's a chance.
We might make it.
If you stay here, you'll die!
We are staying with the purser!
- Couldn't talk anybody else into it?
- We're on our own. Let's get inside.
Get them inside! Get in!
Let's get to the tree!
Hold it!
One at a time!
- Don't panic!
- Goddamn it, get off my back!
Don't panic! One at a time!
Get off my hand!
One at a time! Take it easy!
Give me your hand, Reverend!
Give me your hand!
I'm going under! Help me, help me!
I'm going under!
I'm going under!
I'm going under!
Help me, help me! Please!
Oh, my God! I don't want to die!
Please help me! Please!
Don't hang on me! Help me!
Which way to the kitchen, Acres?
This way, sir.
What is that?
Fire, sir.
- That's a special fire door, eh?
- Yes, sir. It's a safety door.
- It closes at high temperature, right?
- Yes, sir.
So any fire would be out of oxygen...
Smothered, wouldn't it?
- That's the theory, sir.
- Let's test it.
- Get them to stand away from the door.
- Hold it!
Do you know what a flash fire is?
I won't let you kill us!
I'm going through that door, Mr. Rogo.
You can either close that door behind me or try to stop me.
Now, what's it gonna be?
I always thought I was gonna catch it in some tenement by some criminal.
Okay, open it.
Move back against the bulkhead, please.
Would you move back?
Thank you. Over there.
Here.
Get back! Go on!
Get back, all of you!
Excuse me, Mr. Rogo.
What if he doesn't come back?
So, how the hell do I know?
Well, we have to do something.
We have to formulate some plan.
Meanwhile, what do I tell the others?
Tell them to bring out their hymn books and start singing.
Get back! Get back!
Okay.
- Okay, what?
- Acres.
Where does the companionway by the kitchen lead to?
Down to... Up to Broadway, sir.
- What's Broadway?
- Service way that runs along the ship.
Does it lead to the engine room?
I don't know much about below deck but there might be access from there.
There is!
- You again?
- Sorry, sir.
Robin, how do you know about Broadway?
I went there with my engineer friend.
He called it Broadway when he took me to the boilers.
That's it then.
- You're taking his word for it?
- Why not?
- He's just a kid!
- Mrs. Rosen, no more Christmas trees.
I'd be grateful.
- Can you make it, Acres?
- Oh, yes, sir.
I'm fine, sir. Fine.
- Get your brother.
- Nonnie, come on.
- Belle, we have to go.
- Let's go.
There's a lot of dead bodies in there.
Don't touch anything, it's hot.
No! Manny, the fire will burn us.
We'll go back!
For 30 years you've given the orders, now obey mine. We're going through!
I'll take care of you!
Acres, is this the only way?
Yes, sir.
We'll need something to pull you up with.
Reverend, try this.
Acres, you first. I need you.
Rogo, give him a hand.
Rogo, Rogo, Rogo.
Mr. Rogo, put this around his waist.
What I don't like about you, Scott, is your attitude.
Or is it deeper?
Maybe we're two of a kind and you don't like looking at yourself.
Through those doors?
Oh, no, that's the crew's galley.
It's...
It's that way, sir.
- Get the rest of them.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
All right, grab ahold of this.
- I'm surprised the lights still work.
- Emergency circuit and batteries.
Supposed to stay operational for three hours.
They better.
Oh, God.
- Well?
- There's no other exit from this area.
There's gotta be. Think.
You're all right, Belle.
Go ahead, pull.
It's okay, Mrs. Rosen.
I helped my dad pull in a 600-pound swordfish off Hawaii.
There.
That's it, sir...
...down there. Right there.
I think that's it, sir.
- This leads to the central shaft?
- It's what I've been told.
- Where does it lead to?
- I think there's exits on all decks...
...like this one.
- It doesn't look very promising.
- No, it doesn't.
Okay, up you go.
The water's coming in!
The water's coming in!
- There, grab it!
- The water's coming in!
Shut up!
Come on, get up this goddamn ramp!
We all can't be as composed as you are, Mrs. Rogo.
Come on up here.
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Get the hose down here.
All right, grab it!
- Bring it down.
- Come on!
- Pull! Pull!
- Get up.
Don't panic, don't panic!
All right, all right.
- Rogo.
- Yeah?
- Bring them this way.
- Everybody down this way.
It's crazy. We're sinking!
Nothing will keep us from drowning!
- Keep moving!
- He's right.
- There are air pockets everywhere.
- Air pockets?
Yes.
That last deck flooding doesn't mean this one will.
- How long will we stay afloat?
- Long enough.
Andrea Doria stayed afloat
10 hours before sinking.
You see, we've got a long time to go.
Come on, keep moving.
This duct leads to a vertical air shaft.
Through that little hole?
This little hole will get us up to Broadway.
We've climbed four decks, two more to go.
- This is the only way.
- You expect a person to fit in there?
Mrs. Rosen, you'll crawl through there, believe me.
She has this illusion.
Always thinking she's too fat.
- Rogo, follow me.
- I figured. It's me again, huh?
Why?
I'll need you when we get to the other end of this duct.
- Mr. Martin!
- Yes, sir?
See that everyone gets in and follow at the rear.
Oh, okay, Reverend.
I'm going next...
..so if old fat-ass gets stuck in there...
...I won't be caught behind her.
Come on, kids, you're next.
Manny...
...if I get stuck, push.
Don't worry, you won't get stuck.
Watch your head.
That's it.
- Okay, Nonnie, you're next.
- No, with you.
With you.
- Mr. Acres, would you, please?
- Yes, sir.
Come, we don't want to lose the others.
You'll be right behind me?
Like two peas in a pod.
Quickly!
Hello!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, in there!
You follow me. And don't look down.
Easy does it. Come on.
Get your foot up on the ladder.
That's it.
Go ahead, you're all right.
Go ahead, honey.
I said, don't look down!
Okay, okay.
Thattagirl. Take it easy.
This must be it! Bring them up!
Don't lose your footing.
Your turn, kid.
Give Mrs. Rosen a hand.
All right, come on.
- How you doing, Mrs. Rosen?
- Fine.
I think I'm getting my second wind.
How are you doing, Mr. Rogo?
Fine, fine.
Don't mind that. Don't mind that.
- Just look up.
- Manny, are you there?
- Where else could I be?
- Mrs. Rosen....
I didn't mean it to sound the way it did.
I miss something?
When I told you about Dad's 600-pound swordfish...
...I didn't mean that you weighed that much.
With all that's happening, that's what you're worried about?
Sure. What else?
You're a good boy.
Tell my sister.
Watch your leg now.
It's all right, Mrs. Rosen, come on.
I'm coming.
Press against my back. Push.
- You go first.
- All right, Mrs. Rosen.
But don't... Don't go too fast.
Manny, are you behind me?
You haven't lost me yet.
Up you go.
Up, up.
Keep it moving!
Nonnie, you all right?
I'm sorry.
I can't move.
I can't.
Nonnie, keep your eyes on the ladder.
Don't look at anything except the ladder.
I'm right here. I'm with you.
Do you understand?
All right, now, one rung at a time.
Just reach up your hand.
Now, don't think of anything but the ladder. Go ahead, Nonnie.
Come on, what are you doing up there, taking a coffee break? Move it!
Please, Mr. Rogo.
All right, Nonnie, now your foot.
Step up.
Step up.
That's it.
That's it.
That's the one.
The first rung's the tough one.
Now again. Now again.
Once more. That's it.
All right. One rung at a time now.
Now your foot. Now your foot.
Keep going. That's it.
Okay. Now the next rung.
Those terrible explosions.
- What's happening?
- It's all right. It's all right.
We're still afloat.
Look!
My God! There are others still alive!
You stay here. Help the others out.
I'll see where they're going.
- Where you going?
- We're following the doctor.
Doctor!
You're going the wrong way.
You're going toward the bow.
That's right, Reverend.
Wait a minute.
You can't get out that end.
- Why not?
- Because we're settling by the bow.
The bow's underwater.
Go to the stern.
We'll exit through the engine room.
- It's gone.
- How do you know?
The explosions. You must've felt them.
The only way out is forward!
Did you check the engine room?
Did you see it?
I don't have to. We're going forward.
Please, come with us, Reverend.
You're going the wrong way, damn it!
We lost Acres.
In the shaft. He fell.
Where in the hell were you?
What's that supposed to mean?
I told you to keep everybody rounded up!
- Mr. Rogo did the best he could...
- You don't have to defend me.
I've had just about enough from you.
Who do you think you are, God Himself?
- He was hurt and needed protection!
- So he was hurt!
The boat tilted and he fell!
The shaft blew up!
He's dead. That's it! Or do you want to make something more out of it?
I said I'd get everybody out and, goddamn it, I'll do it!
Mr. Scott, all those other people, where were they going?
They're going toward the bow.
But they're wrong.
The bow's underwater!
How do you know?! Have you seen it?!
What makes you so damn sure about everything?
If all those people think they're right...
...maybe we should go with them!
Not you!
That's brilliant!
Twenty people decide to drown, so that's all right.
That's typical.
Everything by numbers...
- Stop it, Mike!
- He's been right so far.
Wait a minute.
May I make a suggestion, please?
We'd feel more secure if you two would stop fighting!
Well, what do you want us to do?
I'm gonna make a deal with you.
I'm gonna go to the stern, to the engine room.
And if it's passable, we're gonna do it my way!
If not, we'll go forward.
You got it?!
Preacher!
You got 15 minutes.
If you're not back here in 15 minutes, we're going the other way.
You're on.
Wouldn't it be a good idea to look around...
...try to find things we might need, like food or something?
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Good.
All right. Start looking, everyone, but stay in the area.
Nonnie, let's take a look.
Manny, wait a second.
I want to ask you something.
I'll follow Mr. Scott. Stay here.
No way. I'm gonna help find things.
Okay, but don't stray too far.
Manny, have you still got your handkerchief?
It's not very clean.
Reverend Scott.
Mr. Scott.
Why aren't you with the others?
I'm scared.
I feel safer with you.
You will get us out of here, won't you?
Oh, you bet I am, Susan.
You bet I am.
We can't get out this way. But we went by a lot of other passages.
We'll look down every single one until we find that engine room.
Okay.
Okay, come on.
We're never gonna see our little grandson, are we?
Now, darling, you have to think positively.
We'll see him. We'll see him.
If any of us are saved,
I hope it's those two children.
They still have their whole lives in front of them.
Stop giving our lives away.
We'll come out of this. All of us.
Now you just sit here while l...
Manny...
...you are a good man.
You're such a good man.
- Promise me something.
- Depends. What?
If I'm not back in five minutes, tell the others that I was wrong.
Tell Mr. Rogo to do it his way.
Understand?
I promise, but you'll be back!
I'll be back.
Look at that.
A whole new idea of cutting hair.
Strap the customer in, push a button, raise him up, flip him over...
...let his hair hang down and snip, snip, snip.
Yeah, snip, snip, snip.
My brother, Teddy, has lovely hair.
He's really dead...
...isn't he?
I can't go on without him.
I can't.
Nonnie...
...you will go on.
We do, you know.
We have to.
At first we don't think it's possible...
...but in time, believe me, in time...
...you'll find other things, other people.
Someone else to care for. You'll see.
- Brandy, rope, axe.
- We found these.
Good, good. Well, it's 17 minutes and he ain't back.
- Sixteen minutes.
- Let's go.
- Can't we wait a few minutes longer?
- What for?
We're gonna move that way and fast.
Mr. Rogo!
- What's wrong? Where were you?
- With Mr. Scott.
We found a hatch he thought might lead to the engine room.
So he told me if he wasn't back in five minutes to tell you...
- ...to do it your way.
- Come on, kid, pull yourself together.
Goddamn it, that does it!
We've been wasting time...
...while we should have gone up front with the rest.
Wait! After all he's done for us, we can't leave without him.
- You act as if he's already dead.
- I agree.
He made a deal!
We're sticking to it!
We're going up front right now!
Let's move it!
I found it! I've been there.
Do you hear me, Rogo? I've seen the engine room and the way out.
And it's this way. To use your words,
"Let's move it!" Come on.
Robin? Wait, where's Robin?
Last time I saw him, he went that way.
Wait, Susan, you take everybody to the hatch. I'll find Robin.
- I can't without him.
- Will you trust me, huh?
You're the only one who knows where the hatch is. I'll find Robin.
- That poor little boy.
- Keep going, he'll find him.
Robin, come here!
In here. Up that ladder.
- All right. Up you go.
- Not without my brother.
- Up you go.
- Wait.
- Get up there.
- Robin!
Oh, my God.
Get him up here!
Get up there, boy. Get up there.
Sorry, Sis, had to go to the john.
- What a dumb, stupid way to die!
- I said, I'm sorry!
- Where do we go now?
- Down!
Close that watertight door!
Down? That can't be.
I've been keeping track.
We've come up eight decks.
Each deck we passed flooded.
Not the engine room.
I've seen it. We go down!
This is no goddamn engine room!
Where the hell are we?
That corridor leads to the engine room.
- But now it's underwater.
- So we'll swim. Give me the rope.
- You're kidding!
- She's right.
The engine room's probably underwater too.
It's in the clear. It's one deck up.
I saw it. It's above us.
I'll swim up a companionway.
It's not more than 35 feet.
Oh, is that all?
We can do it. Believe me.
I'll tie the rope on the other end.
When I get there, I'll give a tug.
Pull yourself along the rope.
Take a deep breath.
It can't be more than 30 seconds.
- How long can you hold your breath?
- I don't know.
Do me a favor. Try it now.
- Mr. Rogo, time him.
- Go ahead.
Look at this. I was the underwater swimming champ of New York...
...for three years. I held my breath for 2 minutes 47 seconds.
- Let me do this, please.
- You were 17 then.
You've all been dragging and pulling me all this way.
Now I have a chance to do something
I know how to do.
Please, may I do this for everybody?
I'm perfectly capable of holding my breath long enough to swim 35 feet.
Thank you.
Hey, hey, preacher.
Take a deep breath.
- Anybody timing him?
- I am.
He's swimming through corridors and up and down stairwells.
I'm the only one here trained to do that.
Will you shut up!
What makes you think you can do it?
You can ask anybody in the Women's Swimming Association.
Just because I put on a little weight doesn't mean I wasn't once an athlete.
- What time now?
- 39 seconds.
- What?
- The rope's not going through!
- Maybe he's there.
- Give him more time.
He said he'd tug on the rope.
What'll we do, goddamn it?
What'll we do?
Pull him back. Pull him back!
Give, you son of a bitch! Give!
Belle, be careful.
Manny, you think I'm planning to be careless?
What does she think she's doing?
Let her go.
She knows what she's doing.
- She must have found him.
- Oh, thank God.
They must have made it.
You see, Mr. Scott, in the water,
I'm a very skinny lady.
They're not tugging!
Wait, wait, give them time.
I guess I'm not the champion...
...of the Women's Swimming
Association anymore.
Hold on, Mrs. Rosen. Just hold on.
Mr. Scott...
...enough is enough.
Let me go.
Please, let me go.
Give this to Manny.
Tell him he has to give it to our grandson...
...for both of us.
You see, that's the sign for life.
Life always matters very much.
Oh, God.
God, not this woman.
Oh, God, not this woman.
Something's happened.
Belle would've signaled.
- They've had enough time.
- That does it.
- I'll go find out what happened.
- No, you'll drown too!
- Let me go, it's my wife!
- Let him go.
I'm going through.
All of you stay put until I come back.
- Give me that flashlight.
- Mike, please!
Take it easy, baby, I'll be back.
What the hell happened?
You didn't pull on the rope.
I got trapped.
Mrs. Rosen freed me.
Thanks, Mrs. Rosen.
If it hadn't been for you, none of us...
Oh, Jesus.
Go back and get the others.
- What'll I tell him?
- Tell him nothing!
Just go back and get them!
You had a lot of guts, lady.
A lot of guts.
I'm okay, baby.
- I'm okay.
- Belle, is she all right?
She got through. She saved Scott.
She cleared the way for all of us.
She got through.
But something went wrong, didn't it?
Like I told you, she did everything.
Mr. Rosen, follow that rope!
Something did go wrong.
She got through. Now listen to me.
I want you all to step up here, take deep breaths and swim along that rope.
You'll be in the engine room soon.
It is above water like the preacher said. You kids first.
I can swim three pool lengths underwater, but Sis can only do two.
Okay, kid.
Now don't forget.
Take a couple of deep breaths.
All right, go.
I can't swim.
You can't swim?
No, not a stroke.
Now you two.
Mr. Rogo, would you mind going?
I'll help her.
All right, but let's make it snappy.
No horsing around!
- You really can't swim at all?
- No, I can't.
- But you can hold your breath.
- Yes.
That's all you need.
Start taking deep breaths and hold the last one before you go under.
And hang on to my belt.
I'll pull you through.
No.
You've got to, Nonnie.
I'm not leaving without you.
You really mean that, don't you?
Why don't we stay behind?
We don't have to follow the others.
What will happen?
- We might still be rescued.
- Maybe, maybe not.
You really won't leave me?
I'm not going without you.
I just have to hold my breath.
- That's all. And don't let go of me.
- No, I won't.
- Ready?
- No.
All right, now we'll take three deep breaths and then we go.
Belle.
You all right, hon?
Help!
Get her!
Get up here!
Come on. Come on.
I've seen the propeller shaft opening.
We're almost home.
Only we must keep moving.
Now, come on.
- You bastard, ain't you got feelings?
- Now, look!
Listen to me, all of you.
Mrs. Rosen is dead.
We can't bring her back.
But what we can do is keep moving.
That's what she would've wanted!
So let's keep moving, come on!
Get up!
Get up, come on, let's keep moving.
Come on.
- You too, Mr. Rosen.
- No, my place is here with her.
God bless, Mrs. Rosen.
Look, Mr. Rosen....
The last thing she said to me was:
"Give this to Manny to give to our grandson from both of us."
Your place is with the living.
If you don't come with us, her death is meaningless.
Now come on.
All right...
...but you go first.
I want to stay with her just a while longer.
You got one minute.
All right, listen.
You see that red valve up there?
Beneath it is the entry to the propeller shaft area.
The propeller shaft is that silver thing.
And this catwalk is the way we get up there.
Now follow me.
It's this way, Mr. Rosen!
This way!
We can't get through that way.
We'll have to go up.
Stay here.
One more door and we're home!
There it is, Mr. Rogo, just like I told you!
- Come on!
- The little bastard was right.
Linda!
You! Preacher!
You lying, murdering son of a bitch!
You almost suckered me in!
I started to believe in your promises!
That we had a chance!
What chance?
You took from me...
...the only thing I ever loved in the whole world.
My Linda.
You killed her!
You killed her!
You killed her.
You killed her.
Mr. Scott, the hot steam!
It's blocking our escape!
What more do you want of us? We've come all this way, no thanks to you!
We did it on our own, no help from you!
We didn't ask you to fight for us!
But damn it, don't fight against us!
Leave us alone!
How many more sacrifices?
How much more blood?
How many more lives?!
Belle wasn't enough!
Acres wasn't!
Now this girl!
You want another life?
Then take me!
You can make it!
Keep going!
Rogo!
Get them through!
What are you doing?! Come here!
Susan. Now.
Get back here!
You can't help him now.
Susan, get back here!
Susan, come here!
Susan, come here!
Get up here. Get up here.
Come on. No.
What do you think you're doing?
You heard the reverend.
He said, "Get them through."
Well, go ahead. Get us through!
It'll be all right, Sis.
It'll be all right.
What kind of a policeman were you?
You've done nothing but beef and complain.
Always negative. Always destructive.
Well, now's your chance to do something positive for a change.
Are you quitting, Mr. Rogo?
Are you going out with a whimper?
On your belly?
All right, you, that's enough!
Pull yourself together, Susan. Robin, take care of your sister. Go ahead.
Nonnie, follow them.
Are you coming, Mr. Rosen?
Watch it around this door. It's hot.
All right, now what? Dead end.
Excuse me, sir, but I don't think so.
- You don't think what, kid?
- You see, sir, I tried to tell you.
We're in Shaft Alley.
Nowhere is the steel hull thinner.
- This hull is only one-inch thick.
- All right...
Quiet! I think I hear something.
My God, there's somebody out there!
Hold it!
Again.
Hold it, hold it.
Again.
Stop it, stop it! It's no use!
No, keep trying!
Mr. Scott wouldn't have stopped.
Let's go!
Hold it, hold it.
My God, there is somebody up there.
The preacher was right. The beautiful son of a bitch was right!
Look. Look!
Get back. Get back.
- How many of you down there?
- Six.
Is that all?
Did you save anybody else?
Anyone from the bow?
No.

Very good. Very good choice.
Please.
It's hot enough.
Ah.
- You'd better dry off.
- See you in the car.
- Hello, my dear.
- General.
Ramírez.
Get me the one on the right.
Darling, you go on to the airport.
I have to stop at the factory.
HAVANA - 1959
¡Alto! ¡Alto!
¡Tírale! ¡Tira!
- Very hot in here.
- Sure is. Look at him.
Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten your seat belts.
We are about to land at Havana.
We remind you that due to political unrest in the interior,
you are advised to contact the military authorities

There you go, folks. Miss Wonderley is from Hollywood, California.
She will be appearing at the Flamingo casino nightclub twice nightly.
There you go.
Stand back, give her some air.
She's a big breather.
- There you go, folks.
- ¡Mira! ¡Mira!
No, you wouldn't want one.

Major Robert Dapps?
- Absolutely. But it's Dapes.
- Of course. I am Rafael Ramírez.
Aide to General Bello, chief of staff of the army of Cuba.
- No, thanks.
- This way, please.
No. it is not necessary. Please.
- Thank you.
- Very nice seeing you.
Sir, could you take off your jacket and open your cases, please?
What kind of country is this anyway?
What do you have to do to get that kind of treatment?
Would you like me to smile?
It's simply for your safe conduct.
- Was your flight pleasant?
- Long.
Yes. Bastante.
There's somebody who wishes to speak to you.
- I take it. I take it.
- No, no, no. Nothing.
- Two pesos. Very heavy.
- Forget it!
No, no. No, no.
I don't need a taxi. I'm being met.
- ¡Señor!
- Oh, come on, will you?
Major Dapes?
How do you do? Roger Maxwell-Lefroy.
Thank you.
Although we have no objections to your being seconded to General Bello...
Seconded? He's hiring me.
...we wouldn't want any nosy people to find out about it.
Although British government policy is to support Batista - delighted so to do, now that the US has imposed an arms embargo, shut up shop, so to speak...
However, flogging them clapped-out old tanks and Leyland buses is one thing, hiring out an ex-British officer quite another.
You're not hiring me out.
I'm hiring myself out.
Incidentally, South American squares are full of statues to soldiers of fortune.
- Mostly British.
- Yes, indeed.
And you may accept the money.
- Well, thank you.
- Oh, yes.
But if anyone asks you, you sell tractors, right?
Tractors? I know nothing about tractors.
Ladies' underwear, then. Most soldiers have a working knowledge of that.
But remember that, for all intents and purposes, you are a mercenary.
You could be an embarrassment to us.
Don't think you can pop round to the embassy if you get into hot water, because you won't be welcome, chum.
- Larry Gutman.
- How do you do?
We've conversed on the phone.
Alex! Alex! Alex!
- Major Dapes!
- Guarde eso.
- Do you know who that was?
- Yes. She is of an old Cuban family.
- She is?
- She's a Pulido.
Your photograph, sir. Photo one dollar.
Do you... Do you want to talk money?
- No.
- Quite right.
Quite right. A charming lady like you.
Let me know when you want to talk money.
I guess your husband's busy, huh?
Yes, I imagine so.
That's why he sent you, I guess.
Very nice.
I can always talk money.
The bishop of Cienfuegos
yesterday visited the soldiers
Given the vital task of keeping the bridges of the Carretera Central open.
He is seen here saying Mass for those about to go into action
against the rebels in Las Villas province.
Sport Richie Ashburn, former centre fielder with the Philadelphia Phillies,

said he thought the standard of play was as good as he had ever seen.
- Where's Teresa?
- She must be at work.
No, no, no. No more, Teresa.
I have to clean up.
- I love you.
- Of course you do.
But I'm in trouble already because of you.
I should have been at the airport to meet a rich Yanqui.
Psst-psst!
¿Tendría usted la bondad de darme un cigarro?
Con mucho gusto.
- Gracias.
- De nada.
OK, OK.
Fruit company boss protests.
The United Fruit Company president protested

Looters risk being shot if they take advantage of strikes being called despite edicts.
Elect as president Rivero Agüero.
Rivero Agüero was orphaned at the age of ten.
He worked in the fields, but at 15 he moved to Santiago, where he studied at night and worked by day until he qualified as a lawyer.
This is the man Batista would urge you to vote for in the forthcoming election.
A man of the people, a man of the fields and factories like yourselves.
Qualified engineers without satisfactory employment - your talents may ensure you new assignments, such as exciting DC-6 construction, or in intermediate-range ballistic missiles.
Many more commercial and military products ensure engineers great opportunities.
Home cooking.
Eddie Fisher's lima bean soup.
The popular singing star comes home...
- Yes, Juan?
- Is Gutman here?
Yes, he is.
Leave us alone, Ramón, for just a moment.
Shouldn't he be shown the factory?
- Juan, I am still...
- Of course you are.
And I'm still very much in love with you.
- Are you?
- Head over heels.
A most uncomfortable position to be in, huh?
Yes. I remember.
- What is it this time?
- Very much the same thing as usual.
I shall stop drinking.
In stages.
- I shall deal with the rest myself.
- Thank goodness.
Everything is so much better when dealt with by you.
- Can I have some money?
- Of course.
- For what?
- For entertaining the Yanqui.
- All right.
- Thank you.
Juan, I know you hate it. I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
I want you to do all this. I really do.
I'm not going to manage unless you manage me.
I need you to do it all.
Please?
- Juan, I do want you...
- Good.
Good. it's settled.
Ramón! You can come in now.
Mr Gutman. Did you have a good trip?
Señor Pulido.
- Sorry...
- Call me Juan.
- How is New York?
- Great.
Let's get you settled into your hotel.
You must want to rest.
- No, no. I'm fine.
- Excellent. I'll show you a few things.
The minister for tourism said he expected tourism to recover as soon as the election showed the world
Cuba's democratic stability.
Three found hanged.
Three unknown boys were discovered hanged in the Plaza de Armas.
- It's busy here.
- I'll take that for you.
- May I?
- No.
¿Ha visto a un señor muy alto con un bigote que pasó por aquí?
No.
You're required to register.
I want a room with water which is sometimes hot.
If there's a bath to put it in,
I wouldn't mind.
Hello. Would you inform General Bello that Major Dapes has arrived and is at the Hotel Roma?
Yes, he knows who I am. Thank you.
- Do you have any luggage?
- Only what I'm carrying.
Without luggage we require money to be paid in advance.
- How much?
- Whatever you care to give, sir.
No, no. No.
Well, you're bigger than I am.
- Mr President...
- I am not.
- We are holding an election for president.
- General Batista.
You can live in the security of the
United States with all your family, sir.
You have a house in Florida, sir.
All you have to do is get out, hand over to the new president, whoever he is.
He will be Rivero Agüero.
- You gonna lift the arms embargo?
- Me? Us?
I can only speak as...
We are not privy to the...
What do you want?
We are here to investigate the financial affairs of the Buró de Represión de las Actividades Comunistas.
We may not be able to continue support.
¿Preparado?
Excuse me, I think there's a problem,
General Bello.
- I've lost the Englishman.
- Wait.
Nice one!
You better go find him.
I'm paying Dapes.
Get the police to bring him.
- Sir.
- Nice to see you.
¡Adelante!
Your bash, Vicar.
- Where's the phone in this room?
- In this room it's downstairs.
- It is untrue that I'm not a good worker.
- Yes.
It's her.
She has the right.
Go.
- You tell her...
- What?
That I will not go.
Have her come in here.
- There will be a strike if I go.
- Will there?
- Almost certainly.
- You will go.
There are accepted ways of behaviour in Cuba still.
You can't fire me.
If you don't go, I will make you go.
How?
- What's that?
- He gave it to me.
It was my mother's.
Ramón! Some money.
I will buy it from you. I'm sure that you consider that you have earned it.
No. He never should have given it to me.
200,000 bottles a day.
That's terrific.
Do you get to drink any of it?
Anyway, it all starts with the sugar.
With your permission, I'd like to show you.
My father, Don José Pulido, is one of the wealthiest men on the island.
Rum, sugar, tobacco.
But we are quite separate from the businesses run by my father.
I tell you this simply so that you understand.
We don't need investment.
We, that is the cigar factory, hope to encourage investment so that we might expand.
- Would you like to meet my father?
- Yes, I would.
Ah!
- My father?
- Señor Pulido is very busy.
Tell him I'm here with a friend.
I'd like to introduce him.
- My card...
- He gave instructions...
- Tell him.
- Señor.
Your son would like to speak with you.
Father.
Might I introduce
Mr Gutman from New York?
You have met my daughter-in-law?
- I have. She's a very beautiful young lady.
- Yes, she is.
But my son is quite beautiful as well.
Handsome, charming. Like this pony.
- How do you like this pony?
- Very nice.
But I know nothing about horses.
Juan, how do you like this pony?
- It's good.
- Then I will buy it.
If there is one thing my son knows about, it's horses.
It's the only thing he knows about, which is why my daughter-in-law runs my factory and Juan doesn't.
I hope he'll show you Havana.
It's wonderful.
He knows every casino, every table and every bed in it.
He'd make an excellent travel guide.
As well as a jockey.
I'm not trying to insult my son.
I just want you to be aware of his talents.
Will you excuse me?
- Who the hell are you?
- Police.
- General Bello causes me to arrest you.
- Does he?
Hm. At once.
But... do you have any money?
Not for you, I haven't.
In that case, at once.
Radio Reloj.
And now, news time.
The rebel threat has gone down like cane in Las Villas.
Government troops are taking scores of rebel prisoners.
Rum and coca.
Radio Reloj brings you news every second of the day
the time every minute of the day
Oh!
¡Frio!
No.
No more, huh?
- Well, what do you say?
- I say you are right.
- Where have you been today?
- With the Yanqui.
Yes?
- We're taking him to dinner tonight.
- We are?
- I think we ought to, Alejandra. I...
- You are quite beautiful.
- Aren't I, though?
- Yes, you are.
I fired Teresa Mederos.
Good. You are right.
She was becoming troublesome.
Juan.
Juan, not again. Please. Not somebody from the factory or the house.
I do promise. I do.
Dapes. Robert Dapes.
Until recently a major in the British Army.
Served in the war. Long-range desert group in North Africa, Kenya and Malaya, where he commanded the Jungle Warfare School.
He's an expert in counterinsurgency and has no political loyalties.
Not employed since resigning from the army. Where is he?
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.
- He was met by General Bello's aide.
- Yes, I know.
- You want something to happen to him?
- Yeah. Something.
After the election. I'll tell Castro.
The ability to read is a struggle.
Remember that to be literate is to be liberated, for nobody can ever fool you again.
Two words a day.
Start with "freedom". Start with "hope".
H-O-P-E spells "hope".
This is Rebel Radio.
Radio Rebelde. Radio Rebelde.
- Can I try?
- No. Next time.
Excuse me, General.
El comandante inglés.
Sí. Dapes.
El comandante del ejército inglés.
Mayor Dapes. Sí.
- Major Dapes. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.
Would you be so kind?
Please wait here.
Excuse me.

Skinner. Donald Skinner. Fellow exile?
- Dapes. Bob Dapes.
- Thought so.
- In...
- In?
- Line of business?
- Oh... tractors.
Tractors.
I fly aeroplanes, put out fires, spray crops, that sort of nonsense.
Crop-spraying could really take off here, when Bello puts the unions in their place.
He... is in the police.
You see he's all right and you'll survive.
One of the first things you do here is to grease a palm or two, as it were.
And how much does one tip the captain of police in Cuba?
- I usually give them all I've got.
- I see.
- Slightly less than New York.
- Yes.
Major.
Excuse me.
Major Dapes, General Bello.
General Bello, Major Dapes.
Major Dapes. Glad to meet you.
Sit down, please.
- Thank you.
- Sit down.
- You want to know something?
- Yes.
I guess I couldn't wait until you got around to calling me.
I did call. I told them where I was.
That was very thoughtful of you, but it was unnecessary.
- We would have found you.
- I wasn't hiding.
I'd decided to make my own arrangements.
- Beretta.
- Yes.
- You buying or selling?
- Both.
- Major?
- No, thank you.
Major, how long were you in Malaya?
Oh, an awfully long time.
- Yes, I know.
- I imagine you do.
You want to know something?
I met a man, an American friend.
I told him that I wanted the best counterterrorists I could find.
He told me that I have to buy British.
So here you are.
Bought.
You don't like money?
I don't like being without it.
- But you do like fighting, don't you?
- No, I don't like fighting at all.
- I try not to do too much of it.
- I do.
Have you done much?
Major, tell me what your favourite weapon is and I'll get it for you.
- Brains.
- Brains. Yes.
You've got brains, right? Huh?
You see Ramírez here?
Ramírez is a junior officer.
He got brains.
Went to a military college.
They gave him brains.
With brains, very easy to get a promotion.
- We can make you a colonel.
- Thank you.
My friend Batista was a sergeant until he got brains.
I was a corporal.
Then they had the revolution. The next day I became a general with brains.
That's wonderful.
Some people stay corporals all their lives.
- Look at Hitler.
- Hitler... God rest his soul.
He was foolish enough to take on
Uncle Sam as well as the communists.
Yes. Right. That's the Second World War in a nutshell.
- How are you going to do it?
- Do what?
- Beat Castro.
- Ah.
Minor factors can be taught in a month.
It's quite simple.
- Deny the enemy food, harry and kill him.
- What?
Harry and kill him.
Ambush him, rather than wait for him to ambush you.
- OK. All right. What do you want?
- I need to see what you've got.
Perdóneme, señor.
- Excuse me.
- General.
The parking meter detail.
- Did you get the money in England?
- Yes, thank you.
- I shall keep a record of my expenses.
- No, no.
Spend it. I want you to owe me.
Ramírez here is going to show you a good time.
I want to hear you got to do everything.
If he slips up again, you tell me.
I'll take care of Ramírez in my own way.
Do you play golf?
What's your handicap? Have a cigar.
Major Dapes, I'm going to give you a pass that will let you go anyplace and see anything.
Only don't take too long, huh?
After all, we're fighting a war.
Yes, and rather badly I suspect, too.
See that Major Dapes gets to harry and kill.
- There is something one ought to say.
- Say it.
You will only defeat someone like Castro if you're right.
Is Castro right?
It's not the point.
Does Cuba think he's right?
When you're ready, Mr Dapes.
I expect to be called General.
It's important to call people what they are, sir.
Major Dapes.
How do you work this?
- Marvin.
- Howdy.
- Ready to be beaten?
- You'll be lucky.
All right. All right.
- It's your day.
- It's straight set day.
- She's been practising.
- Oh, yeah?
Might put them off, huh?
- She's worked on her serve.
- She should have worked on her legs!
¡Dos más! ¡Dos más!
The boots are good.
Yes, Batista promised the army good boots... in 1934, when he was a revolutionary.
They wanted very little else then.
What do you say about my on-court play now?
Tell me when you're gonna do that.
You know I can't get to it, Marvin.
Do you think I can mind-read?
Stay up at the net. And don't poach.
Alex.
- I knew it was you.
- Did you?
I'm Alejandra López de Pulido.
Excuse me. if you don't mind, we're trying to play tennis.
Alejandra?
Alejandra!
I'd like to... No.
Better still, muster a patrol.
- Ten good men.
- Ten?
It will be almost impossible to find two.
Does that include you and me?
It isn't usual to go off the road.
Isn't it? No wonder you never get to know anything.
It's the only way.
Get out, move amongst them.
Put your men on the paths at five-yard intervals. All right?
Rafael, tell that idiot to shut up, leave his nag behind and walk quietly.
Apéate del caballo.
You may tell my mother that I am well, Núñez.
And give these to her.
Yes. Yes, you are well. Better, anyway.
We now eat more than one meal a day.
I am getting quite fat.
Bring Captain Ramírez.
- ¡Jefe!
- Shut up!
It's well used. How big is this plantation?
Some five miles. if you're patient, keep your sense of smell.
Sooner or later you'll pick up somebody and they'll talk.
- Smell?
- Mm.
You can often smell a body of men before you see them or hear them.
Especially if they're smokers.
Are you worried about being late for the general?
He likes to show you off to his friends.
What happens if I don't show up?
Oh.
Hey!
Hold your fire!
¡Vamos! ¡Por aquí!
Stop or I'll shoot!
Do you understand English?
I teach it.
It's a girl.
- I want to question her.
- Yes.
First you, then she is questioned by the sergeant and each of the men as many times as possible, and a few days later she is taken down to La Cabana and shot.
It would be much kinder to shoot her now.
I'm not going to hurt you.
I just want to ask you...
Get down!
Women!
¡Fidelistas!
¡Pare eso!
Who is he?
Nobody.
Mr Gutman is in room 214.
What do you mean,
I'm not offering enough?
We are prepared to pay $10,000 for the whole goddamn operation.
Take it or leave it.
Right. Next, Skinner Air.
- What about some money?
- Hm?
- Money. Money.
- Do the bullets fit?
- What?
- Our guns.
Of course. They're 9mm, which is what you asked for.
When we know they fit, you'll be told and paid.
It's a pleasure to do business with you.
Shit!
Mister...
SkinnerAirline is no answer...
- Please take your shoes off.
- Hello?
- Skinner no answer.
- Will you ring Skinner Air again for me?
Hello?
Are you on the house, or do I chip in?
Everything is taken care of by Señor Pulido.
I just have to show you a good time.
OK, we'll see what we can do.
Don't you Cubans realise that time is money?
I do.
Guns?
Hm. Stored in the premises of Alejandra Pulido.
- And is she involved?
- Perhaps.
Whether she is or not, she still has to be questioned.
I used to know her in North Africa.
If she is involved,
I can find out very quickly.
Don't worry. I don't like terrorists.
Especially ones I know.
Come on, come on.
- Get me a cab.
- Sí, señor.
Come on.
- I've been promoted.
- Congratulations.
Batista has promoted everyone in the army.
There are no privates any more.
Now I'm a major too.
I'll buy you a drink.
You know that the situation here is not so good.
I think you've come too late.
I was afraid of that.
You know, soldiering has changed.
It's not as... clean as it was.
I'm still proud to be a soldier.
Why not? it's an honourable profession.
It was.
- Ready for another boring evening?
- It'll be fun. They always serve peas.
Sorry we're leaving, General, but Mr Dulles is sending us home.
I know.
- Hello.
- We're not going far.
- But we may not be able to assist.
- It's OK. I've got an Englishman.
Oh, Don Pulido! Hello, my friend.
Here. Sit down.
Sit down next to me.
All right, everybody. Please sit down.
You can start now. Pick your own seats.
You have enough room here?
There you are.
It's pea soup.
Look out!
I don't know when I had such a good time!
I do, honey.
Is that to your liking? Very good.
This wine's really tasty.
Rafael, get some ambulances here.
¡Ambulancias!
All right, my love. We'll do something.
All right?
Here, let me have that cloak.
Hey.
You unfeeling bastard.
- Fire number one!
- Number one, fire!
- Fire number two!
- Number two, fire!
- ¡Puta!
- I love him.
Love! You lose your job.
I don't care.
¡Puta!
- Your father would kill you.
- My father is dead.
No, your father is not dead.
I go every day to the prison to find out.
He's not dead.
Your brother should kill you.
Yeah, yeah. Julio. Julio?
You gonna kill me, Julio?
No, I'm gonna kill him... maybe.
No, Julio. No. Juan Pulido loves me.
- Where you get the gun?
- Go sell yourself to the Yanquis!
I'm gonna kill your pimp.
I don't have no pimp. I just got a man.
- You got a girl?
- I got a gun, Teresa.
- You couldn't shoot anybody, Julio.
- I hate him.
I'll give you some candy and then you won't shoot my man.
I'll kill him.
Let me know when and I'll tire him out for you.
¡Puta! ¡Puta!
Go and spend the night on the Malecón!
¡Puta! Let everyone buy you!
Oh, shut up!
I'm no puta!
And now, from Hollywood, California, the Christmas show at the Flamingo proudly presents, twice nightly...
- the wonderful Miss Wonderley!
- Sorry, fellas. They just got here.
Held up in customs.
I guess they must be pretty hot stuff.
¡Ambulancias!
¡Por aquí!
Let's have a drink.
Let's have a drink.
- Look at this place. Where is everybody?
-  There's somebody delicious.
We get drinks.
We get free drinks. it's in the contract.
Skinner.
Juan, should you be leaving Alejandra alone?
Here. Look at that.
I don't understand it.
In Miami, we'd have packed the joint.
- What's with you Cubans?
- Has Mr Gutman called?
No.
You're a Cuban.
What's the matter? You don't like broads?
I'm glad to hear it.
When Mr Gutman arrives, send him over.
Excuse me.
We get two per cent of every table.
Don't think we don't need it.
Everybody, but everybody, in this town is on the take.
Julio.
The ammunition does fit.
What?
...does fit.
Pay Skinner... something.
OK.
Well.
Well, what?
Have we nothing to say to each other?
Yes. Of course.
I'd rather he didn't come at all.
Alejandra, I've arranged this so...
Where did you take him this afternoon?
To Father's mill, the rum factory.
- Why?
- To impress him.
Juan, you can't be satisfied with what you have, can you?
The cigar factory is impressive enough.
- It only needs investment to be better.
- Yes, I am arranging that.
Gutman was impressed.
Juan.
You are trying. I do love you for that.
Don't laugh at me.
Thank you.
- Hello there!
- Ah!
I guess we got delayed.
Dolores is very lucky. I got lucky.
My God, is Havana wide open!
We shot a little craps. Did you eat?
I'm lucky for him.
How nice. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Champagne, right?
- Alejandra!
- What?
I will not sit down with that common whore.
- How dare you!
- It's the way it's done.
- Did you arrange her?
- Yes, I arranged it.
Did you?
Let me go! Gutman means nothing to me.
I can do without his money.
Ooh, honey!
There's champagne here!
Ooh, baby!
You know what I like!
♪ Chantilly lace and a pretty face
♪ And a ponytail hanging down
♪ A wiggle in her walk
And a giggle in her talk
♪ it makes the world go round, round, round
♪ There ain't nothing in the world
Like a big-eyed girl
♪ To make me act so funny
Make me spend my money
♪ Make me feel real loose
Like a long-necked goose or like a...
Ooh, baby, that's what I like!
For Skinner.
Faites vos jeux. Faites vos jeux.
Number nine. Rouge, impair et manque.

Hello, Mr Dapes. You are early.
- I am very lucky.
- Are you?
- It appears I'm not.
- I like your photo very much.
- Oh! it's lipstick, huh?
- No, actually, it's blood.
Oh, shaving.
I like a man who shaves smoothly.
Rafael.
Major Dapes, I find the role of procurer very distasteful to me.
- So if you don't like her, then...
- You don't like me?
But I am beautiful.
Yes, you are. it's just that
I try to avoid that which I cannot afford.
Oh! it's OK. You can afford.
Come. I take you to another casino where I am very lucky for you.
I win you maybe two and a half thousand dollars...
- We just bought some champagne!
- Yes, but you have not bought me.
Alex!
- I must talk with you.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- You were a long time ago.
- Alex!
Hey!
- Leave the soldiers alone.
- Rafael.
Mr Gutman. Shall we?
Miguel.
Take me back.
For a second time this evening, a big hand for a big lady.
Miss Wonderley.
Shit!
Bartender.
Robert.
I must tell you.
You could be in very serious trouble.
We must have a talk.
Yes, we must have many talks.
It is lovely to see you again. How are you?
I'm well. And you?
Fantastic.
- What sort of friends do you have here?
- Can't you do better than that?
Apart from your Wimbledon set.
I know. I'm sorry. You frightened me.
- But not now.
- I see.
What do you expect me to do now?
Kiss you?
I see no reason why you shouldn't.
It's been, as they say, such a long time.
Oh, stop it!
It seems like yesterday to me.
Really?
Would you excuse me a minute?
- Alex, about three hours ago...
- Robert.
- Did I ever know your second name?
- Of course you did!
- I did?
- You wrote to me. it got to me.
I can't have been the only Robert in the army.
I should introduce you to my husband.
For that I need your second name.
- Juan, this is...
- Nobody?
Robert, for the life of me,
I can't remember your second name.
Dapes.
- My name is Robert Dapes.
- You must come and visit us.
Do you play polo? Would you like to meet anyone in the government?
If there's enough money involved, you can meet Batista himself.
What line of business?
Tractors!
Yes, go and get him!
What's going on?
Come on, get up.
You, too. Up!
- Aimed at you?
- Yes. At me.
Do you know that young man?
Good heavens, no.
I wouldn't even recognise him again.
- Did you get a good look at him?
- Good enough.
Then you are in for a very long night.
Jorge Ortiz Ruiz.
What's all this about?
- They're waiting to hear.
- To hear?
- About those that have been arrested.
- Hear what?
Major, please.
Monopoly!
Thank you.
They just can't account for $300,000 for the month of June, Spence.
I have some very suspicious cross-entries here, Gary.
We're gonna be here for months.
These accounts are in a mess.
Well, they are experiencing a revolution.
I guess accounts do get out of hand.
No luck.
Thank you.
- Teresa, what are you doing here?
- My brother could kill you.
He's already tried.
Wait here, huh? Just wait.
Where's your wife?
Robert!
Your husband was released some hours ago.
Yes, I know.
Come on.
Do you want to say something?
Or would you rather not?
Yes. I would rather not.
Why were you so upset at the tennis?
Yes, I was. You frighten me.
Because you threaten to change the life I have.
How would I do that?
You already have.
I knew you would.
Where are we going?
Can't we just drive around for a little while?
What have you been doing?
Living in Cuba. You?
Modern warfare.
Fighting people who hide grenades in shopping baskets, shoot up crowded hotels, hack the legs off cattle and leave them dying on their stumps.
That sort of thing.
- Your friends...
- I have very few friends.
Do they toss bombs around, shoot off guns?
No. You do that.
- Rafa!
- Sí.
Take the posters down.
Put them on the truck at the back.
Are you married?
No. But you are.
That should be enough for both of us.
We're very happy.
I seem to remember, when I was once deeply and ridiculously in love,
I was at the same time profoundly unhappy.
That was me.
I did that to you. I made you unhappy.
- I adored it.
- I didn't.
Am I still beautiful? You used to think so.
I seem to remember you were very taken with me.
As a matter of fact, you were terrified that I was.
You got out of North Africa faster than Rommel.
- Actually, he took his time.
- Admit it. I terrified you.
Yes, I admit it. I didn't know so much passion could exist in one so young.
You were the most exotic, breath-stopping creature I'd ever known.
Quite a danger to my health.
What with you and my colonel and being shot at, I'm astonished I survived.
- Perhaps you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
By forgetting all about you.
And how did you recognise me?
You didn't forget me.
You knew me at once.
Yes, I did.
And you haven't changed at all.
I hate coming to these filthy places.
I like these places.
I like you and I like places like this.
I used to bring someone else here.
- Who? You don't still bring her?
- Good heavens, no.
She's my wife.
- When did you marry Juan Pulido?
- Five years ago.
- Any children?
- No.
He doesn't beat you, or anything dreadful like that?
- What would you do if he did?
- Break his bloody neck.
- Would you?
- Of course.
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.
- Egg flip?
- There may be something wrong with me.
Apart from your memory?
I might be too ambitious. Too demanding.
In fact, I am.
Tell me this...
The only question you haven't asked me is why I came to meet you.
Why did you come?
Look out!
Why did you?
With an overwhelming majority Cuba has elected Rivero Agüero as president
General Batista has stated that this will show the world
that Cuba is in the forefront of democracy
Free elections in a free country of the free world
President-elect Agüero has a hard task ahead of him,
but the people of Cuba are behind him against communism and revolution.
He will take office as president at once
and will meet with the ambassador...
- Hey. it jammed again last night.
- You want a Coke?
- I don't have any money.
- That's OK.
We want an explanation, Julio.
My sister's honour's important to me.
It was the work of a Yanqui gangster.
My father, who is in prison if he's still alive, he would cut the balls from Pulido.
He betrayed my sister.
You had no right to do it.
You were given a task.
Which I did.
The money for the gringo Skinner.
And you were seen.
You can't stay on campus, Julio.
I've got to. I can't flunk my courses.
It doesn't matter.
There'll be no more courses.
Now Agüero is elected, there will be a general strike.
Here.
Here.
If you want to kill someone.
The trigger mechanism jammed.
Take the .38.
- Did you vote for him?
- No. Nobody did.
- Somebody must have done.
- Batista, who pays you.
No, I'm paid by General Bello.
Just as good.
You can be sure of your money.
Bello works the parking meters.
Batista pockets the lottery.
Don't you worry about where your money's from?
If what you say is true, it appears I come under "traffic of fences".
It's true.
You don't get involved in any of this, hm?
No, I don't look too closely at things that don't concern me.
Like having your factory used.
Robert, in Cuba every building, every factory, every hotel is being used in some way by someone.
There are things I know nothing about,
I don't turn stones over, and so far my workers have not had a strike.
Even a blind eye can be poked out.
Alex...
I want you to come with me.
Where?
Where? You haven't thought about it?
It's only just being suggested to me.
Where?
With me.
Far?
- Don't play games.
- It's very short notice.
I don't see you for 15 years, you turn up as if yesterday and say...
No. I can't go anywhere with anyone on short notice.
I own a factory, and I do have a husband.
He would have to be told if I was going anywhere, short notice or not.
I'm not asking you to go on a holiday!
Don't shout.
Robert, it's very nice of you, and I know what you're saying.
But I don't really know you, do I?
You knew me when I was a silly girl of 15.
Who fell in love with a handsome British soldier.
Do you know what I remember most about you? Your knees.
You're being ridiculous.
I'm not. I'm trying to prevent you from being ridiculous.
You're obviously not happy with your husband.
- How do you know?
- Because you wouldn't allow me to...
I didn't allow you to anything.
- I made love to you.
- Very nice it was too.
- Yes.
- So?
- So... nothing.
- Nothing?
Nothing. Robert, please try to understand.
I have a house. I enjoy having it.
I enjoy having a husband who is a member of a very important Cuban family.
- It's important to me.
- Rubbish!
Don't speak to me like that.
You're talking about things.
Factories, houses.
- Husbands.
- He means nothing to you.
How do you know what Juan means to me or has meant to me? You don't.
If he means something to you, you shouldn't be here.
- Don't pick that up.
- Don't shout.
- Then pick this up as well.
- I don't know what you're playing at.
- You're unhappy. You won't let me...
- Don't you have a job to do?
I'm going to do my job.
- Then I'll see you sometimes.
- No, you won't.
- I see.
- What did you say?
I said I see!
I'm buggered if I do.
Quédate. Dame las llaves.
Wait! Wait! Stop! Stop!
- Good morning.
- Get out. I'm not hungry.
I'm starving.
Oh.
Well... had a good night?
Like to buy an aeroplane?
Not there, old man. it's outside.
The whole of Havana's on strike.
Not the whole, not yet, but it won't be long.
I had to walk up.
The elevator's out of action.
There you are, you see. Power cut.
Now, then, let's talk about my aeroplanes.
- How much?
- How much can you offer?
- They ain't worth nothing.
- They're going to be worth a great deal.
People are going to want to get out.
And they'll want to take out their goods and chattels.
- Have you got a car?
- Yes, a pick-up.
Even better. Here's what I'll do.
I'll buy your aircraft, I'll buy the cigars.
We'll get the cigars out.
I'll buy the Pulido place.
We'll make a delivery today.
What is the world gonna need?
Havana cigars, right?
Radio Rebelde.
Rebel Radio. Why?
Why has Agüero been elected?
You did not vote. You stayed at home.
But Agüero was elected because the election was rigged by Batista.
What can you do? You can strike.
A general strike is called
This is the voice of revolution from the men and women fighting for a free Cuba.
The end is near. Very near.
Batista soldiers are moving against us but cannot win.
They will be defeated by us and by you.
Strike. No telephones, no transport, no work in the factories.
Support the revolution.
Tell us, Batista, are you leaving now or later?
We know you have five aircraft standing by
for those pimps, pushers, prostitutes who are faithful to you.
Tell us, Sergeant Batista...
Jesús promised me there would be no strike.
Where is Jesús?
¡María, vámonos!
Dígame.
Ah, Ramón.
I think we've got a...
Very well, I will go to the rum factory first and then I will come to you.
And, Ramón, lock up everything and remove the money.
Everybody throughout Cuba has stopped work.
That is apart from servants, of course.
- I phoned Señor Pulido and...
- You had no right to do that, Ramón.
I can handle this.
Calma.
Your husband was shot this morning.
He lasted a long time.
Yes, he did.
I must tell Julio.
Go on.
Go on!
Go on.
¡Guerrillero!
Keep your stupid old mouth shut, woman, do you hear?
We're fighting for you.
One thing I'm certain. She's not involved.
What's the drill?
Try to get her as far away from the factory as possible, before anything happens.
Old man Pulido should be told.
He will be able to help.
¡Ven! ¡Ven! ¡Más! ¡Más!
¡Todo el mundo, fuera!
Follow me!
¡Sigan! ¡Sigan!
Line them up! Line them up!
¡Vale! ¡Vale!
Next. ¡Arriba las manos!
Nothing, eh? Next.
¡Levanta la barrera!
Shoot him! Shoot him!
Over there!
- Why were they shot?
- They tried to escape.
- From what?
- From being shot.
- How did they know they were rebels?
- They tried to escape.
- Wouldn't you?
- Yes.
- Are you a rebel?
- If I try to escape.
Wasn't it the same in Malaya?
- No, it wasn't.
- You're here to teach us.
I am not working...
- it's over, master.
- You're meant to be in charge!
¡Huelga! Down with him!
- Who dared to allow...
- They dared to.
- What will you do?
- Me? Nothing.
I'm here merely to take your leavings, Father.
Your houses, your old factories, your old mistresses.
How dare you talk about your wife in that way.
You would think he'd be the last drunkard that will ever be in Cuba. Look at him!
You load the truck, I'll go do the deal.
Um...
But sure...
What is this, Labor Day?
Go on.
Señora Pulido!
Just name the price, I'll buy the works.
The factory, every goddamn cigar you got.
It's no problem.
This very day I intend to fill a plane full of your cigars and fly to Miami.
All you gotta do is tell me how much.
You can stay here and run the factory for me until the whole shoot collapses.
All I want is two planeloads a day.
- I bought the trucks, the planes...
- Mr Gutman.
There's a man behind you with a gun.
Oh, dear. Um...
- Agh!
- Shh! Quiet!
- I will shoot this woman.
- I don't doubt that you will.
Search him.
Search him!
- With this you can go anywhere?
- Can you read?
I read law at university.
I'm not in the least surprised.
You can't use it without me.
There's a bad likeness stuck to it.
- You'll come.
-  Where?
- Load the guns.
- Where are you going?
- To Santa Clara, to Fidel.
- They are for the city.
We were told to wait here.
- I'm taking them to Castro! You come too.
- Ah!
So you can say "I was a Fidelista" before it is too late for Fidel to notice you.
I shoot her first if any of you try anything.
Put the guns in the truck and cover them with cigars.
Get up.
Is there enough fuel to get me to Miami?
- Sí, señor.
- Right.
- But the water dump tanks are full.
- Doesn't matter. I'll drop it out on the way.
Have a... whatever you drink.
¡Gracias, señor!
You're driving very badly.
Perhaps you're not used to driving such an expensive car.
Perhaps.
Why are you fighting for a country that's not yours?
I will fight for any elected government that makes me an offer for my services.
Would you fight for someone who paid you more?
No, I would never fight with a gun to overthrow a legitimate government.
So you decide which governments are legitimate?
Wonderful.
Oh, God. Guerrillas.
- Dame.
- No, but...
- El arma. Sí.
- I'm...
They will come out at us from the cane fields.
I told Batista our soldiers were too tired and did not want to fight.
- That is a fair assumption.
- We'll see.
We must hold on to the gasoline depot.
We must not lose that.
- Have you any interest in oil?
- Yes...
I am going to speak to Castro.
I will say to him "You got to get rid of the communists in your army."
"if you don't make a deal,
I'm going to harry and kill."
- Harry and kill. You know what I mean?
- I know what you mean.
We're full. Switch the flow onto six.
- What?
- Switch the flow onto six.
Juan, take a look at this. Come here.
Get up! Come on!
- ¡Por favor!
- Get up!
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco.
Probando.
Here we go.
If Batista's soldiers wish to surrender, they will be well treated.
I repeat, if Batista's soldiers wish to surrender, they will be well treated.
It is not a disgrace to surrender to your own revolution.
There is no honour in living a lie.
If you die now, you will at least die a free man.
Come home. Come to us.
We are you, you are us.
Stand still where you are and listen.
When you take prisoners who have fought for the revolution, you shoot them.
We, however, do not intend to shoot you.
You will be released, handed over to the
Cuban Red Cross and returned home.
Those who are criminals, guilty of crimes of torture, murder, you know who you are.
You may hide, but you'll be found.
The depot!
Tell the tanks that the gasoline depot is swarming with Fidelistas.
Chambelona Red? Over.
I hear you. Over.
Major Dapes.
That's right.
- You said he was to be killed.
- Be quiet.
This is Colonel Leyva.
You are to attack the gas depot Over.
Chambelona Red.
- Major, you are a paid soldier.
- Of course I'm bloody well paid.
We're not paid.
- You're not soldiers.
- OK.
But though we aren't soldiers, we're fighters.
And we are winning.
- We'll send the Yanquis home.
- I can't wait.
We'll fight the parasites that feed on the people.
The Church, gangsters, soldiers.
Soldiers are the worst parasites.
- Don't talk to him. Kill him.
- We're not killing anyone.
- I'll kill him.
- Would you care to try without a gun?
- Give me that!
- No!
I brought guns to you!
We did need guns, but now we need brains.
You go away and rediscover yours.
It isn't easy to be given a gun.
We make it a privilege.
What do you intend doing about thugs like him?
It might be more to the point to ask what they intend to do about us.
Get down!
Gutman, you can drive a car.
Then you can drive a tank.
No. What are you doing?
You want to go home? Then come on!
Pull it back! Come on!
Come on! Get out!
Hey! Look out!
Come on!
- It's just the same as a car.
- But mine's automatic.
Where's the goddamn wheel?
What are you doing?
- Pull on the sticks!
- What?
This is Colonel Leyva.
Do you hear me? Over.
- Got him!
- Who?
Get us off the road!
There's another one coming!
- Stick!
- Pull the left lever!
- Stick!
- Yes!
I can't see anything.
Keep it going.
You're over-revving.
Change gear!
You're flooding it!
Can I help?
Make bandages out of this. That way you won't ruin your nails, sweetheart.
Pull! Pull!
Pull! Pull!
Come on, move! Get us going.
Soldier!
Someone!
Get them! Shoot straight!
Come on! Shoot!
¡Burro! ¡Burro! ¡Ya! ¡Ya!
- Shoot them!
- ¡Manos arriba!
¡Hemos ganado!
Gutty, come on.
Come on! Move!
Quickly! Hurry up!
- You'll roast in there! Come on!
- I can't!
Back! Go back! What are you doing?
-  Come on!
-  They're gonna bomb us!
Uh? Uh? Must have been one of ours!
¡Roberto!
We've done it, Spence.
I never thought we would.
- We got them to balance.
- Sure have.
Do you want to go out and see something of Havana now?
Sure.
Take the other one! This one's mine!
OK, but quick. Bello might come back!
Quick, let's go!
Pack your things as quickly as you can.
It'll take time to clear you with the British
Consulate and arrange your ticket.
I'll send the car back from the airport.
Where has she been, my wife?
With you?
Yes. She's been with me.
- Am I expected to take her back?
- No, you're bloody well not.
- Where are you taking her?
- Out of Cuba.
Why?
Cuba won't change.
A few people will leave. My father will go away for a while, so will Batista, and then they will both come back.
And once again Batista will get his face on the front of Time magazine.
Whatever you say, I want her out of here.
Stop talking about me as if I'm not here.
Robert, you don't understand.
I don't want to leave Cuba. Ever again.
I regard those years spent away as lost time.
There was nothing, and I include you, Robert, nothing that made them memorable.
No, I cannot go with you.
Stay here with me.
Robert,
I know what I've done to you and me.
But if you take me away from here,
I wouldn't seem the same to you.
- You don't understand, do you?
- You're right I don't understand.
I don't understand you or him or his father or even myself, sitting here bloody well discussing...
Hey!
Get in.
I'll send the car back.
It's up to you.
What do you think will happen to you?
Mind your own business, señor.
Thank you. That seems a perfectly reasonable reply, chum.
It's not like you to be so unselfish.
It's not like you to notice.
Where are the keys to the sports car?
In the car. Where are you going?
For a drive.
You will be back?
Pan American regret to announce that all scheduled flights are cancelled

Hey, sweetie, come here.

Seats will be allocated on a first come, first served basis.
- It's Batista!
- Running away!
He is going again! Look!
Batista! ¡Bandido!
The ship must be sinking.
Cubana Air. The excess baggage regulations will not be waived
Please make sure you are only carrying that which is absolutely essential.
No! Leave it! Come on!
The forces of the revolution are on their way to Havana.
At their head is the man they call "El Caballo", Fidel Castro.
They arrive in buses, carts, anything with wheels.
It has taken seven days for this march up the Carretera Central.
- Mummy! Soldiers!
- Keep quiet and come with me.
Goodbye.
Ahh.
Everybody, make a line here, please.
Those who want to go, you go.
Please take your cases and pass through customs.
This way, please.
Air Cubana passengers.
Would all ticket holders please move in an orderly manner towards the gate?
Give this to Alex Pulido if she shows up.
I can't wait.
We talk to his comrades, the men who have fought with him
since 12 men came to Cuba and took to the Sierra to start the fight
At the palace
Fidel is reported to have said
that he does not need such a place.
He hopes the people of Cuba will keep an affection for the palace...
Tickets ready, please. Tickets!
Fidel! Fidel!
Come on Ranjeet, it's your turn.
I'm thinking what I'm going to be doing.
You have been thinking for five minutes.
Patience
We are playing scrabblo not patience.
- What do you want Su Lee? okay, here we go.
Full cycle to win.
Very good. Bravo.
Right. It's your turn now Zoltan.
Hey. Attention. Zoltan's turn.
It's all right. You throw
I'm no bad. What you want
- You are getting better
- Yes?
- You are starting to hit the board. - Good.
What happened?
You are supposed to throw it forward not to the backwards.
Where is it?
It's alright. I see it.
Oh me.
It's a good thing you were wearing a turban Ranjeet otherwise it would have gone straight through your head.
Oh, blimey! You wouldn't have felt it.
You will feel my first in a moment.
Come on Ranjeet.
I'm still thinking.
Yeah, Shiks are slow thinkers.
Shut up man.
We must have time limito. Come.
Oh, I'm getting a good one.
Sugar.
No goodo.
Quel idiot! Sugar is not spelled S-H-U-G-A-R.
I think you are mistaken.
You damn fool. Everybody know sugar is spelled with two Gs.
We win! You want game Juan?
We no have time. Mr. Brown he will be here pretty soon!
You frighten you lose?
I bet you blind folded.
Let's see you get double the top with Your eyes closed.
Easy. Easy.
Closed.
One, two,
Jamila.
Who did this?
Me. I was trying to get that in top.
Looks like you get it in the bottom.
Are you hurt Sid?
Huh?
Did it hurt?
You bend down and you'll find out.
- What is going on in here?
- Not a thing.
- A dart game.
- I beg your pardon.
Sid was us telling how he used to dart playing.
Well in future Sidney, kindly remember that the students have more important things to do, did you get my point?
Yeah, and his point as well.
- Good heavens!
- What's the matter?
This door is full of holes.
Maybe it's a wooden worm.
Wood warm.
Yeah, it's alright.
Yes. I just had a telephone call from Mr. Brown.
He says he would be along later.
Apparently, he is tied up at his flat.
Oh, blimey. Shouldn't we be going to untie him?
I was speaking metaphorically.
It is better you speako English.
Silence. Now Mr. Brown may put up with you stupid remarks but I assure you will find me a very different kettle of fish.
Excuse me please, what is mean kettle of fish?
You'll find out. Now, until Mr. Brown
Arrives, I intend to find out what sort of progress you are making.
You, how are you doing?
How are you doing?
Very pleased, thank you.
How are you doing?
I'm inquiring about your English.
Your English
No, no, Hungarian.
You're hopeless.
No, no, look Hungarian.

If it's true, you won't get away with it.
Where are you going?
You say there's egg in this?
There's no egg in it.
But it tastes good.
What's he saying?
It's strange when peopIe can't understand each other's words.
Hey kid. Do you know where this man is going?
Hey kid. Do you know where this man is going?
But if I asked, I bet you're going to say you don't know.

Fukuryu-ji.
Fukuryu-ji? Fukuryu-ji...

I think it's near
Mamada.
In that case, feIIow, you've come exactIy the wrong way.

The Chinese man?!
Sorry to be a bother.
Anma... Are you with the Chinese man?
No, I... met him on the road.
He asked me to guide him to Fukuryu-ji.
Oshige.
Hurry and Iet them in, then bar the door.
AIIow me.
You guys... It's Iucky you weren't seen.
Just a short whiIe ago, henchmen of boss Toubei of Furukawa came here.
Of Furukawa?
Of Furukawa?
Right. They're bIanketing the entire area.
They said to inform them if we saw him.
There's a 10-ryo bounty on that Chinese man.
There's a 10-ryo bounty on that Chinese man.
10-ryo?
This boy... he's the son of the
Chinese peopIe they kiIIed.
Yes. So it appears.
My daughter and I were there when it happened.
We ran for our Iives.
After that Chinese man hacked up the vassaIs of the Nanbu fief and escaped...
...it was so crueI.
About three Samurai Ieft the procession...
...and murdered everyone who was in the vicinity...

Ieaving no witnesses.
The Samurai of Nanbu did it?
You mean to say, then...
...that it wasn't the
Chinese man?
They've made it his fauIt now.
They've made it his fauIt now.
Why did they do such a thing?
By kiIIing everyone who was there...
...then onIy their version of events wiII be heard.
That procession was carrying an offering of abaIone to the Shogun.
For some Iousy abaIone...
Dear... What are we going to do?
They have a chiId with them...
We can Iet them stay the night...
...in the potato shed out back.
It's the Ieast we couId do.
Let's do that.
Oyo-ne, make them some- thing hot to eat.

Nah. They won't find you there.
Okay.

Then you guys...

You can Ioad dice...

Come on, aren't you betting?
Hi. Let me join you.
It's a bIind guy.
It's a bIind guy.
A bIind guy?
A bIind guy?
Yeah...
A bIind guy?
Who are you?
A traveIing anma.
He's says he's an anma.
He's says he's an anma.
Shut up! I'm not deaf.
Hey, anma...
This town of
Furukawa...
...is Henoichi's turf, and that's me.
Are you...
...knowing that I'm Henoichi, trying to muscIe in?
Oh no, I don't intend to do any work here.
But if I decide to stay for a whiIe...
...I wiII drop by again to pay my respects.
Fine, then.
You do have a bankroII, don't you?
Yes. Without a bankroII...
...you can't gambIe.
AII right. I'II put the squeeze on you.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Here, sit here.
Hey. Hey.
Two anma are going to squeeze each other.
Neither wiII see the outcome!
''Kame (the gambIer's name):'' turtIe.
Shut up... you mud turtIe.
Hey, you.
How much wiII you bet?
How about 10-mon.
""10-mon?!""
So, um...
...which wiII it be, sir, taiIs or heads?
Heads, then.
Heads, then.
Yes.
Yes.
TaiIs, maybe.

TaiIs, maybe.

But then again...
Which is it? Make up your mind.
Yes. In that case, heads.
It's taiIs.
Which side wiII it be next?
Indeed... you're pretty good at this.
What do you mean?
The way you say that is a IittIe...
...accusatory.
...accusatory.
Did I touch a nerve?
Did I touch a nerve?
You did.
Did I touch a nerve?
WeII...
Hmm...?
What's up?
What are you two aII happy about?
What are you two aII happy about?
That's right.
Anyway...
...did the Chinese man get caught?
AImost, it was reaIIy cIose.
That's too bad.
Yeah. I gave him a fierce gIare...
...he foamed at the mouth, and scrammed. Right?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Jackass!
You were supposed to say yes, that's why
I'm buying you drinks!
That's right. You gIared at him.
GIared, gIared, gIared!
Too Iate.
Moron!
But reaIIy, he was just Iike a Tengu.
That so...
That's right. He fIew, and waIked over our heads.
Boss Toubei hasn't given up yet, has he?
Give up, you kidding? He's searching up one side and down the other.
And his appearance is unusuaI, so he'II eventuaIIy get caught.
Why is Boss Toubei so desperate about this?
That's because...
That's because...
That's because if aII goes weII...
...the boss has been promised that his men wiII be in charge...
...of assisting the Nanbu fief's procession.
I see.
By the way, Henoichi... how do you know aII this?
The boss has chronic stiff shouIders...
...so he's a reguIar of mine.
I wish I couId rub the shouIders of such a great boss.
If you want...
If you want...
Yeah?
Yeah?
I couId take you there with me.
Yeah?
Maybe next time. PIease, have a drink.
Maybe I'II have one, too.
Um, couId I...
Um, couId I...
Oh, sure.
This IocaI sake is reaIIy good!
Hey, come on, come on.
Hey. What's the matter with you guys?

Hey... Oyo-ne!
Ooops!
This is terribIe...
Take this!
And this!
And that!
And another!
She's stubborn.
Hey... I hear there's a brat invoIved.
It's the brat who disrupted the procession, isn't it?
If he gets caught, the brat'II be kiIIed.
We've got an informant.
There was an anma with the
Chinese guy, wasn't there?
What do you know about the anma?
His name's
Zatoichi.
He's in the same business as us. He's a Yakuza.
He's a dirty bastard who'II do anything for money.
That anma... he's the informer?
So the Chinese guy was staying at your pIace, then.
And you know where he's headed, don't you?
Keep up your stubborn act, and just Iike your parents...
...we'II make sure you never taIk again!
Hey.
Damn it!
Hey... Zatoichi's here.

Yosaku's daughter? I've no idea who you're taIking about.
Yosaku's daughter? I've no idea who you're taIking about.
I'm reIiabIy informed that she's been brought here.
You were trying to heIp that Chinese guy, too?
You were trying to heIp that Chinese guy, too?
That is none of your concern.
It's enough that you bring me the girI.
It's not enough!
You've got some nerve...
...sticking up for a vioIator of shogunate Iaw.
Don't make me Iaugh.
You yourseIf waIk the back aIIeys of the Iaw.
HeIping someone in troubIe is simpIy the humane thing to do.
BIind bastard! Don't buIIshit me with your cIever words!
If you dare to show your face at my pIace...
...you'd better be ready for the consequences.
Oh no, you've got it aII wrong.
AII I want to do is take the girI with me.
It's aImost the new year.
Don't throw your
Iives away.
Here.
PIease give the girI to me.
I don't know what you're taIking about.
I don't know.
I see.
I guess you're deaf.
And since this ear can't hear...
Your eye next?
The girI... bring her here.
Boss...
PIease show us the way out.
Don't do anything!
Hey...
Open the door for her.
As you've decided to Iet the girI go...
...you might as weII do it pIeasantIy.
Miss Oyo-ne.
How terribIe it is.
Your parents...
...were Iike Buddhas. To have that happen to them...
Here is...
...just a IittIe, maybe you couId buy incense...
So if it's for money...
...you'II do anything, won't you?
Even if peopIe...
...peopIe get kiIIed for it.
I wouId never...
Is that what Toubei toId you?
I...
...even if it takes me a Iifetime, I want the satisfaction of vengeance.
What sin did father and mother commit?
To you, to the Chinese man, to the boy... aII they did was offer some tea.
Why shouId they be kiIIed for that?
If onIy they had turned you aII away...
If onIy they'd been Iess kind...
If onIy they'd been Iess kind...
Miss Oyo-ne...
Miss Oyo-ne...
You...
Miss Oyo-ne...
...wanted the 10-ryo reward money, didn't you?
And that's why...
...you informed them of the
Chinese man's Iocation.
Yakuza...
You're the same as Toubei and the rest of them. Yakuza!
Miss.
I am sorry. This is aII my fauIt.
I shaII avenge their death.
Who was the informant?
Who was it?
Why hasn't that bIind man returned?
Where did he go?
What did he do?
CouId it be...?
He followed me around.
Why did he do that? lf the girl's parents were killed because of him...
I wiII kiII him!
Let's go to
Fukuryu-ji.
What's going on with you?
Huh? Hi, Iady.
You're quite hammered.
Nothing's going on.
Miss. What are you doing?
Don't embarrass me.
Can't you see what
I am?
I guess a bIind man can't.
Because of this Chinese- man fiasco...
...peopIe aren't coming out at night.
Which means business reaIIy sucks.
Hey...
What... if I take you to a nice inn tonight?
Ah. Thank you very much.
But I'm in no mood for that. I'm sorry.
You don't have to apoIogize.
Hey. Let me have a sip.
Want me to go get you another two or three bottIes?
Just one wiII do.
Ready? Woooo! Choose!
Ready? Woooo! Choose!
TaiIs!
TaiIs!
Hey, hey, hey!
TaiIs!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
I feeI Iucky!
I feeI Iucky!
Let's do it again!
I feeI Iucky!
Here it comes.
Here it is.
Here it is.
Heads.
It's taiIs.
TaiIs.
Hey, buzz off. How dare you pat a gambIer's shouIder. Er...
I brought you a hot one.
Yeah. Thanks.
Thanks.
You're Sugito's gang, aren't you?
You informed them of the Chinese man's hide-out, didn't you?!
Shut up, you bIind bastard!
We'II kiII you, even if we have to foIIow you aII the way to heII!
Don't throw your
Iives away.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
What?
What?
Is there a Chinese man and boy here?
What?
Is there a Chinese man and boy here?
Is there a Chinese man and boy here?
You mean Wang Kang?
You mean Wang Kang?
Wang Kang?
You mean Wang Kang?
I don't know his name.
But he is here, is he?
But he is here, is he?
He is.
He is.
Good.
He is.
I'm gIad to hear that.
WiII they be at this tempIe for awhiIe?
There is aIso a girI caIIed Oyo-ne, who guided them here.
Oyo-ne?
You know these peopIe?
N...No...
T...T...Thank you.
If you'II excuse me.
Wang Kang.
A bIind man was asking about you.
What? A bIind man?
Where is he?
Wait.
The abbot said you must not go outside the gate.
What is the matter?
He made sure we were here...
...and then Ieft at once?
Who is that bIind man?
He's a Yakuza, caIIed
Zatoichi.
""Zatoichi?""
Wang Kang was enraged when he heard that he was asking about him.
What is going on?
Has the abbot toId you to not taIk about this?
But I am an exception.
When I went to China for training...
...Wang Kang and I ate from the same pot.
I am concerned about him.
Won't you teII me?
He is being hunted by the Samurai of Nanbu.
Why?
To save this boy...
...he kiIIed Samurai that were in a procession.
That man informed them of his hide-out.
He wanted the reward money...
...because of that... my father and mother were...
They were murdered?
Are we safe? What if that man does it again?
Are we safe? What if that man does it again?
Even those of the Nanbu fief cannot set foot in this tempIe.
ShaoIong.
What were you taIking about?
What were you taIking about?
Miss Oyo-ne says she Iikes you.
She Iikes me?
What did you teII him?
That Miss Oyo-ne
Iikes Wang Kang.
I wonder where Ichi vanished to.
I wonder where Ichi vanished to.
Who's Ichi?
Who's Ichi?
You know. Zato-ichi.
Who's Ichi?
You know. Zato-ichi.
You know. Zato-ichi.
Don't say it Iike you're chums.
Don't say it Iike you're chums.
But he and I even had a drink together.
Don't say it Iike you're chums.
But he and I even had a drink together.
But he and I even had a drink together.
He just Iet you drink some.
But what do you think?
But what do you think?
What about?
Do you think Ichi's stiII here in Furukawa?
I think he's stiII here. It's a bIind man's intuition.
You think so? I don't think he's stiII around.
Even Zatoichi couIdn't take on boss Toubei.
They say, ""WhiIe there is Iife, there is rope.""
They say, ""WhiIe there is Iife, there is rope.""
Moron. That's ""hope.""
Moron. That's ""hope.""
Who cares which of us is right?
Moron. That's ""hope.""
You want to bet on it?
You want to bet on it?
Sure.
Hey, Kame. Who do you bet on?
Hey, Kame. Who do you bet on?
I bet on Mister Henoichi.
I bet on Mister Henoichi.
Bastard, you're a traitor.
I bet on Mister Henoichi.
Bastard, you're a traitor.
Bastard, you're a traitor.
No I'm not. It's just that this bet's a cinch.
I'm taIking about whether Ichi's stiII around these parts or not.
And I'm saying he's here.
And I'm saying he's here.
Where?
Where?
Right behind you.
Where?
Good evening.
Good evening.
Having a few?
Mister. Give me a hot bottIe.
Mister. Give me a hot bottIe.
Hey, change seats with me.
Ichi.
Ichi.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ichi, how are you?
Yeah.
Ichi, how are you?
Ichi, how are you?
Fine. Fine.
Fine. Fine.
I was toId that if I saw you around...
Fine. Fine.
...it's funny to say ""saw you around"" when you're bIind...
...to bring you with me.
...to bring you with me.
B... By who?
B... By who?
I can't teII you the name. Let's go.
B... By who?
I can't teII you the name. Let's go.
I can't teII you the name. Let's go.
Let me have a drink first.
Let me have a drink first.
Never mind, Iet's go. Let's go.
Let me have a drink first.
Here's your waIking stick.
What's going on?
What's going on?
HeIIo.
Do you know whose house this is?
Hey, Lady...
How much did you pay those guys?
1-ryo.
I hear the sound of running water.
There's a river out back.
The sound of water is nice. As if it washes my feeIings cIean.
Come in.
Come in.
Yes. AII right.
Yes. AII right.
Sorry the pIace is so dirty.
Yes. AII right.
Sorry the pIace is so dirty.
Sorry the pIace is so dirty.
Right. Don't make fun of the bIind.
It's just that it feeIs Iike you see better than sighted peopIe.
Wait here whiIe I go heat a bottIe.
Don't mind me. I'm scared about what comes Iater.
I thought I'd give you a drink when you came.
I was ready for your visit.
I just want to be of use to you.
Is that so?
If my word can't convince you...
...perhaps my body can.
What's the matter?
Hey. I heard a strange sound.
What happened?
What do you mean, what happened?
My nose is about to faII off!
And my eyes are about to open.
This is... this is disgusting!
Is no one here?
Is no one here?
What is this?
For a beggar monk, you've got some attitude!
We got no business with monks. Beat it.
We got no business with monks. Beat it.
I have business with you. That's why I'm here.
Let Toubei know
I've arrived.
''Inn: Joushuu-ya''
RegretfuIIy, I must decIine your offer.
Master...
I cannot justify further expense on behaIf of the fiefdom.
Is that so? You Iet a foreigner disrupt the procession.
You then made a mess of things.
What if that becomes known?
The Nanbu fiefdom wiII Iose face.
If the fee for saving face is 1000-ryo,
I wouId say it was cheap indeed.
What if this got out to a feudaI
Iord that covets your fief?
It wouId be out of your hands.
That wiII...
You can't say it wiII never happen.
Depending on the situation...
...I might seII them this information.
What?
What?
Wait!
I understand. I wiII accept your offer.
How shouId we proceed?
Excuse me. More vassaIs have arrived from Edo.
They've arrived?
They've arrived?
Yes.
This way pIease.
This way pIease.
WeIcome.
WeIcome. You must be tired.
We were waiting for you.
Did you find out where he is?
We have an informant. I'II introduce you to him. Come in.
WeIcome.
This way pIease.
I've had enough.
I brought this sake to cheer you up. Have some more.
Thank you.
Kakuzen... The reason why I crossed the ocean and came to Japan...
...was because here, having no enemies,
I couId Iive in peace.
I prayed that I wouId never have to use my sword again. But...
Forget about that. You yourseIf have never been first to draw a sword.
That's right. I never drew first.
That's right. I never drew first.
I know that.
Thank you. You are indeed a trusted friend.
Hey. You'II catch a coId.
Retreat!
Don't chase them!
It's terribIe!
ShaoIong...
ShaoIong has been kidnapped!
What happened?
She says that ShaoIong has been kidnapped.
What? ShaoIong was kidnapped?
Wang Kang. It says here that if you come to a specified pIace...
...ShaoIong wiII be pardoned and reIeased.
How did they Iearn so quickIy that he was here?
Maybe that bIind man toId them.
A bIind man came here?
It was my error in judgment. I thought he came to see the three of them...
...so I toId him about them.
If you go, you wiII
Iose your Iife.
If I fear death, what wiII happen? The boy wiII sureIy die, and this I cannot permit.
Kakuzen... Oyo-ne thinks of that boy as her own IittIe brother.
Go and teII her to not worry.
Go and teII her to not worry.
Yes.
Bastard. Where did he go? Hey, go that way.
Hey. Brother. Have you found him?
Go that way.
Hey, did any of you see a woman around here?
A woman? There are three of us here.
A woman? There are three of us here.
Smartmouthed bitches.
Same to you, buddy!
They're gone.
Better not come out just yet.
Hey, you.
Why are guys Iike that after you?
They can't be after you for no reason.
If you can't teII me,
I won't ask.
I'm sorry.
Do you by any chance know the inn...
...where vassaIs of the Nanbu fief are staying?
Wait a second...
Is your name...
...Oyo-ne?
How did you know that?
There's someone I want you to meet. Come with me.
Why are you running?
Miss Osen. Who is that?
It's Miss
Oyo-ne.
Miss Oyo-ne?
Why did you Ieave the tempIe?
She says she wants to meet with a Nanbu Samurai.
A Nanbu Samurai?
Did something happen?
You know very weII what happened.
You... why did you come to Fukuryu-ji?
Because I...
That poor boy.
The boy?
And you... why wouId you want to meet with a Nanbu Samurai?
If I can, I want to take the boy's pIace.
He's aII aIone, in a strange Iand.
How frightened he must be.
What did the
Nanbu say?
That if he went to them, they wouId absoIve the boy of his crime.
But if he does so, he wiII sureIy be kiIIed...
...and I cannot Iet that happen.
They're not the kind that wouId be moved by such a pIea.
Then what shouId
I do?
What eIse is there that I couId do?
Where are they making this exchange?
I don't know.
Stop this. Don't get invoIved any further.
Are you going to throw your Iife away?
Miss Osen. I have a favor to ask of you.
I know. You want me to investigate.
You're stupid, and
I'm stupid, too.
Miss Osen.
Miss Osen.
What?
Man it's coId, coId, coId, coId, coId!
Man it's coId, coId, coId, coId, coId!
Mister Masa.
Mister Masa.
Osen, it's you. Give me a sake.
Mister Masa.
It sure is coId.
I don't fooI around with whores.
It's not about that.
Did you find that girI?
No, we didn't find her.
How much wiII you give me?
How much wiII you give me?
You know where she is?
You know where she is?
Yeah.
You know where she is?
I'II pay you after we catch her.
I'II pay you after we catch her.
I want it up front.
Here you go.
She's at my house.
She's at my house.
What? Let's go!
I have a question for you.
W...What?
W...What?
Where is the chiId?
You don't know?
They pIay dirty. They use a chiId for bait...
...and they're pIanning to kiII them both.
That's the Nanbu way of doing things.
Where is the meeting pIace?
Where is the meeting pIace?
Bodaiji-hara.
What time?
What time?
The sixth hour, tomorrow.
The sixth hour, tomorrow.
Who ratted out the Chinese man?
The sixth hour, tomorrow.
Who ratted out the Chinese man?
Who ratted out the Chinese man?
A monk of the tempIe, named Kakuzen.
A monk did?
Ichi! Ichi!
Ichi!
Ichi. Ichi.
Hey... I...
About the brat.
They're taking the kid to their home territory. These guys overheard.
Is that true?
When?
Tonight.
Osen. How do I get to the Mito highway?
I...I'II guide you.
Leave the chiId, and begone.
Who's there?
Show yourseIf!
Show yourseIf!
I'm here.
""Save the chiId.""
That's what Ojizo-sama said to me.
Kid.
Kid.
""UncIe!""
As for the pIace in question...
...keep it weII-guarded.
My onIy concern is that bastard Ichi.
Didn't he Ieave the area?
BIind peopIe are tenacious.
It seems he hasn't Ieft the Iodging district.
Do not Iet him Ieave the district!
Agreed. Damn it... I can't Iet him Iive.
Miss Oyo-ne. Don't you worry about a thing. I'II bring him back safeIy.
Thank you.
I was stupid.
I thought it was aII your fauIt.
It doesn't matter.
On the other hand, that shit-monk... he's a totaI bastard, betraying his friend.
Oh, yeah...
You need to get out of this heII-hoIe right now.
What's going on?
Toubei's gang is moving around the Iodging district.
They toId us to not hang around there if we vaIue our Iives.
BIind bastard.
He did show up after aII.
That's what you get, you bIind bastard.
Drag him out of there and sIice him to bits!
Right.
Hey.
Shit!
Hey, Ichi... Do you reaIIy think you're getting out of the district aIive?
Boss Toubei, huh?
This time you won't
Iose just an ear!
What did you say?
BIowing whistIes: custom for bIind masseurs to bIow a whistIe as a caII to customers.
You shouId stick to bIowing whistIes.
Cut him up!
Drop your weapon.
Where is the chiId?
Where is the chiId?
Throw away your weapon.
Where is the chiId? Why aren't you showing me the chiId?
Why aren't you showing ShaoIong?
I have come as I promised.
The chiId! Where is the chiId?!
Where did you bastards hide the chiId?! Where?!
ShaoIong is not here.
Why is he not here?
Those who disrupt a procession must be punished.
Even if they are chiIdren.
That is the Iaw!
The Iaw? You promised to reIease the chiId if I came.
Why did you break your promise?
FeudaI Iords must maintain their authority.
This is far more important than any promise made to you.
To me, a promise has more vaIue than Iaw. Kakuzen.
How do you know that
ShaoIong is not here?
I'm the one who arranged to Iure you out here.
Wang Kang! You too must obey the Iaws of Japan!
Kakuzen! You have betrayed your friend! How shamefuI...
How shamefuI of you!
Is he over here?
Morons! You're even more bIind than he is!
He's around here somewhere.
Hurry and find him!
Yessir!
What are you doing? He's just one bIind bastard!
Toubei...
Boss! Boss!
Wait...
I'II take you on.
Zatoichi!
You're aII right.
You are a horribIe person.
I can't Iet you Iive!
Draw your sword!
I'm at a Ioss.
I can't understand your Ianguage.
I don't want to have it out with you.
What a skiIIed bIind man!
Wait! Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
What a pity...
What a pity...
Now I know that you weren't a bad guy...
If onIy we couId have understood each other.
If onIy we couId have understood each other.
We wouIdn't have had to fight.
The End

{13144}{13190}You get out!|Get!
{13191}{13239}One of the animals?|Well, i'll be dogged.
{13240}{13292}You didn't tell me you had|cattle around here, button.
{13294}{13362}- Liliha!|- Booton!
{13363}{13423}We don't, that thing's wild. But|i sure hope he eats the turnips.
{13424}{13504}Well, he may be wild,|but he ain't no thing.
{13506}{13583}That's about a thousand|pounds of prime bull out there.
{13584}{13667}You stubborn,|willful, worthless,
{13668}{13741}Misbegotten beast!
{13743}{13798}That's a right nice|vocabulary, miss Macavoy,
{13799}{13855}But you'll never|talk him out of there.
{14214}{14272}Look at it.|Just look at it.
{14494}{14574}- Is this soup?|- Soup!
{14753}{14829}- Oh, hi, Costain.|- Howdy, barton.
{14831}{14886}Booton!
{14888}{14971}Look what i got for you.
{14973}{15087}That's right nice of you, son, but i'm|not real hungry just now. I just ate.
{15089}{15176}No, it ain't to eat. It's a|real hawaiian hat. For you.
{15179}{15226}Do you like it?
{15227}{15325}Like it?|Yeah, yeah, it's, uh--
{15326}{15374}It's real colorful, ain't it?
{15375}{15434}Make you look|real pretty, boss.
{15436}{15492}Put it on. It'll be great.
{15494}{15574}Well, it's just|a little more decorated|than what i had in mind.
{15575}{15665}That's all right. Make you|look real hawaiian style.
{15791}{15873}That really is quite|becoming, you know.
{15874}{15934}It's time to go into town, Booton.
{15935}{15983}I don't think i'll|go in today, mom.
{15985}{16039}I've got some things i've been|planning to do around here.
{16094}{16210}Well, all right. You be sure and|make yourself useful while i'm gone.
{16211}{16266}I'll be back by supper.
{16303}{16357}Ma'am.
{16358}{16444}Ma'am, you won't forget to ask|about a ship for me, will you?
{16446}{16559}I'll check the ships in port for a|work passage situation, mr. Costain.
{16561}{16610}Thank you, ma'am.
{16611}{16694}And if i had a good-Bye kiss,
{16695}{16793}I just might bring home|some rock candy too.
{16794}{16840}Bye, mom.|Have a good trip.
{16842}{16902}You behave yourself.|Come on, tuck.
{16904}{16954}Come on, come on.
{17219}{17269}Hey, son.
{17343}{17421}- What's the matter?|- She's probably gonna see that Bryson.
{17422}{17471}Who's that Bryson?
{17473}{17535}He's some old man who keeps|pestering her to marry him.
{17537}{17599}Oh.|I sure hope she don't.
{17601}{17686}- Why is that?|- Well, he wears perfume|for one thing.
{17688}{17761}He's always patting me on the|head and calling me "my boy."
{17762}{17877}That's what he always says.|"Well, my boy, you're|sprouting up like a weed."
{17879}{17934}He probably thinks|that's a compliment.
{17936}{18000}Well, it's not.
{18001}{18057}I'll say this for him though.|He's got good rock candy.
{18059}{18132}Oh, well, that's|a good quality to have.
{18133}{18183}A lot of men|don't have that.
{18185}{18265}Say, how 'bout you showing me|around the spread?
{18266}{18337}Well, sure. I'll show you|where i fished you out first.
{18338}{18409}Down by the cliffs|there's some caves and things.
{18474}{18525}All right, hold it up.|Can't see it all|in five minutes.
{18677}{18769}I do wish you would begin to take me|a little more seriously, henrietta.
{18771}{18827}I do, Cal.|You know i do.
{18864}{18921}You know what a disastrous|year last year was.
{18923}{18992}And crop prices don't|look any better this year.
{18994}{19048}- Then with the increased|burden of taxes--|- Oh, we'll muddle through.
{19049}{19123}- We always have, haven't we?|- Yes, but that's the point.
{19125}{19188}There's no reason for a woman|like you to have to struggle so...
{19190}{19236}Just to eke out|a meager existence.
{19238}{19284}Why don't you put|the place up for sale?
{19286}{19332}But i don't want to sell the farm.
{19334}{19385}You know how much it means to me.
{19387}{19456}Yes, i do.
{19458}{19545}My company is going to do|great things in the islands.
{19547}{19593}And as my wife,|you could--
{19595}{19642}I could have anything|my heart desires.
{19644}{19691}And i know you mean that, Cal.
{19692}{19752}But don't you see.|It just isn't possible.
{19754}{19809}Even if--
{19811}{19852}With the amount of money i owe you,
{19854}{19980}It is not proper for us to talk about|anything but a business relationship.
{19982}{20053}Money means nothing.|You know that.
{20055}{20136}- It means nothing at all.|- It does to me.
{20138}{20223}- Henrietta, i wish--|- Please.
{20306}{20348}That isn't going to change.
{20350}{20438}If ever i can do anything,|you just let me know.
{20440}{20497}Of course.
{20627}{20680}Good-Bye.
{21015}{21091}- And who are they?|- Those are the workers.
{21092}{21143}- The workers?|- Yep.
{21145}{21205}What do they do|when they're not working?
{21207}{21267}Well, there's lots of work.|We own 10,000 acres.
{21269}{21325}Biggest potato farm|on the islands.
{21327}{21388}Ten-Thousand acres of potatoes?
{21390}{21491}Most of it's open country.|Potatoes haven't been|doing too well.
{21690}{21755}Ten-Thousand acres, huh?
{21795}{21906}That's a good-Sized pea|patch, even where i come from.
{21907}{21975}- Where's that?|- Texas.
{21977}{22117}There you can ride for a month in|any direction and never touch a fence.
{22119}{22183}- Must be beautiful.|- Oh, it is.
{22184}{22262}Costain, do you think you|could ever like it here?
{22263}{22311}Me? No, no.
{22312}{22381}No, this fruit bowl|ain't for me.
{22383}{22440}Some people might like|it just fine, though.
{22442}{22496}I suppose you're going|back to texas, huh?
{22498}{22549}You bet.
{22605}{22692}- You got a wife there?|- Haven't met the woman|that could afford me.
{22694}{22764}- Then you never|did have one.|- Nope.
{22766}{22857}I had small pox once though.|Amounts to about the same thing.
{22859}{22906}Yeah.
{22908}{22970}I guess you'd never|want to settle down|and live with someone,
{22972}{23058}- No matter how nice she was, huh?|- You got that right.
{23108}{23157}But you can't have kids|if you ain't married.
{23158}{23221}Yeah, ain't that a mercy?
{23268}{23317}What are you going to|do when you get old?
{23318}{23374}Die, i guess.
{23375}{23461}No, i mean before that. Who'll take|care of you if you don't have a son?
{23462}{23525}I'll say one thing|for you.
{23526}{23578}You get a notion, you|sure hang on to it, burton.
{23579}{23629}Booton!
{23630}{23683}Oh, yeah.
{23685}{23747}- What's that?|- Come on!
{23932}{23983}What's going on?
{24403}{24465}- Untranslated subtitle -
{25022}{25079}Oh, no.|Those cattle again.
{25289}{25363}Go on! Get out!
{25921}{26001}Out of the way!|Hey!
{26003}{26070}Hey! Hey!
{26159}{26210}Costain!
{26235}{26303}Hey!
{26305}{26367}Out of the way!|Out of the way!
{26369}{26448}Costain, come on!
{26810}{26876}Hija! Hija!|Hija!
{27080}{27142}Hija! Hija! Move!
{27497}{27565}Costain! Costain!
{27698}{27792}Turn around, son!|Face him!
{27793}{27877}Don't move! Freeze!
{28596}{28659}All right, boy.|Run for the house.
{28853}{28905}Ya! Get out of here!
{29027}{29093}You should've seen|that critter, mama.|I was really scared.
{29095}{29168}And then he kept twisting that|bull's head 'til it fell over.
{29170}{29226}And then he let it go,|and it ran off.
{29227}{29298}That must've been|quite a sight.
{29299}{29395}So, you know how to tame them?
{29396}{29461}It's not a matter|of taming them, ma'am,
{29463}{29511}It's just a matter|of handling 'em.
{29512}{29611}You could sure handle 'em. Just like you|handled that bull. Pow! Right, Costain?
{29613}{29688}Booton!|Mr. Costain.
{29690}{29787}Mr. Costain, you could probably make those|old cattle do whatever you took a mind to.
{29788}{29867}I don't know about that.|It doesn't make much difference.
{29868}{29969}No point in talkin' about it.|You're in the potato business.
{29971}{30075}Were in the potato business.|Prices have dropped off|terribly.
{30111}{30190}Well, it seem to me|like you're...
{30191}{30272}Struggling|your way past a dollar,|just to grub after a dime.
{30274}{30377}You can get $20 a head for|them cattle in california.
{30458}{30530}But what you do|is your business.
{30531}{30603}Me? I'm on my way|to texas.
{30604}{30660}As a matter of fact, mrs. Macavoy,
{30662}{30738}Did you find anything in the way of|a ship for me when you were in town?
{30739}{30817}Oh, no. I think it's|the wrong time of year.
{30819}{30893}- But mama--|- For ships.
{30913}{30959}- I mean--|- Well, i'll just|have to make do.
{30961}{31010}I won't be imposin'|on you folks.
{31012}{31085}I'll head into town|tomorrow and wait.
{31086}{31162}As long as you're going to wait,|you might as well wait here.
{31163}{31218}Beg pardon, ma'am.
{31220}{31330}And work-- Help out.|I could pay you.
{31331}{31376}A little, not much.
{31378}{31453}Room and board too.|Right, mama?
{31454}{31566}- I don't know.|- Just for a while.
{31567}{31682}Until you earn so money. You'll|need some money, mr. Costain.
{31684}{31760}And, who knows?
{31762}{31852}With your help, we might|turn this sorry potato farm...
{31854}{31973}Into the first and only|wild cattle ranch in hawaii.
{32030}{32080}You, uh--
{32082}{32146}You sure you're not|from texas, ms. Macavoy?
{32147}{32194}You will stay,|won't you?
{32195}{32284}Won't you, Costain?
{32286}{32360}Well, i'll hit her a lick|and see what happens.
{32362}{32421}But that's all i'll promise.
{32581}{32655}- Aloha.|- Aloha, miss maka.
{32657}{32709}I want to talk to you this morning...
{32710}{32835}About some changes that are going|to be made on the farm today.
{32837}{32933}Mr. Costain is a|cattleman from texas.
{32971}{33052}And he knows how to handle the|animals as you all saw yesterday.
{33054}{33100}Yeah.
{33101}{33222}We have not been doing|well with our potatoes.
{33263}{33384}Mr. Costain feel we|would do better...
{33385}{33485}- If we caught the animals and sold them.|- Caught the animals?
{33486}{33550}Oh, no, wait!|Wait, wait!
{33552}{33652}You mustn't be frightened.|Mr. Costain assures me...
{33653}{33793}That the animals can be handled,|and he is going to teach us how.
{33794}{33866}Aren't you, mr. Costain?
{34172}{34226}All right, now.|This here animal is a horse.
{34228}{34342}Now you're all gonna have one of these|to chase them brush doggies out there.
{34373}{34421}Brush doggies.|That's cattle.
{34423}{34475}You need one of these|to keep up with cattle.
{34477}{34537}There's only two things you|gotta know about a horse:
{34539}{34616}How to get on and how to stay on.
{34617}{34712}This is your saddle, where|you're gonna sit when you ride.
{34713}{34786}You just sit in there like|a rocking chair, you savvy?
{34788}{34857}Just walk up here and put|your foot in the stirrup.
{34859}{34936}That's the stirrup. That's|right there. See it?
{34938}{35006}Put your foot in the stirrup|and swing right up. See?
{35016}{35077}To! Bravo majstore!|Svaka èast!
{35136}{35202}Good. Now who's going|to be the first to try it?
{35273}{35385}Well, there's one thing you can't|learn to do, is ride without getting on.
{35387}{35445}- Now come on!|- Go, go, go!
{35447}{35495}Come on.
{35496}{35568}All right, now.|You all watch him.
{35720}{35771}To! Bravo majstore!
{35801}{35857}Turn around.|Go on, turn around.
{36496}{36554}Now you try it.
{36972}{37051}Yes, it's true.|They do like their fun.
{37053}{37117}Like it? They'd rather|giggle than laugh.
{37119}{37205}They'd rather laugh than eat.|They're like a bunch|of kids out there.
{37207}{37261}A school girl'd be more sober, ma'am.
{37263}{37308}Well now, after they|get to know you better,
{37310}{37359}And understand what you're|trying to teach them--
{37360}{37423}Oh, and another thing.|You say you can't buy|any horses.
{37425}{37477}Now, how do you expect|me to work cattle...
{37479}{37549}With one|old wall-Eyed refugee|from a glue factory?
{37551}{37605}- Well, maybe--|- If you could get 'em,
{37607}{37669}You don't have any bridles,|saddles, blankets.
{37671}{37751}You don't have|any spurs, boots.
{37753}{37831}Ma'am, they don't even have|anything decent to wear.
{37832}{37935}Well, if we need horses...
{37975}{38026}Perhaps i can get some.
{38027}{38099}I-I don't know how.
{38144}{38178}Yes, i do.
{38179}{38269}I can get horses,|and i will.
{38271}{38340}And their clothes may not suit you,
{38342}{38398}But they find them very comfortable.
{38399}{38471}Yes, ma'am, comfortable.|I think that's the right|word for it.
{38472}{38562}Besides, anything they need,|they can make here.
{38563}{38678}There isn't|a single thing needed|that we can't make right here.
{38680}{38729}Except for a--
{38731}{38822}A little determination|and leadership...
{38823}{38886}From a man|who has the know-How.
{38887}{38968}And that is a fact, mr. Costain.
{39016}{39099}When are you going to stop|calling me mr. Costain, ma'am?
{39172}{39275}When you stop calling me|ma'am, mr. Costain.
{39614}{39680}It's just a formality, henrietta.
{39682}{39730}I don't think you should|even bother to sign it.
{39731}{39816}I will not take another loan from|you without giving proper security.
{39818}{39886}This is a mortgage for|all of your property.
{39887}{39942}It's disproportionate,|it's not necessary.
{39943}{40047}Cal, i owe you a great deal.|Now i need more money.
{40105}{40126}And this is the only|way i'll take it.
{40127}{40179}Business is business.
{40181}{40263}- Even between us?|- Especially between us.
{40294}{40350}All right.
{40352}{40426}- Thank you very much. And good night, Cal.|- Good night, henrietta.
{40871}{40923}Another favor|for the lady?
{40925}{40987}As a matter of fact,|yes.
{40989}{41095}Whenever she needs money,|she can always ask you.
{41097}{41145}And i give.
{41146}{41214}And now, the mortgage.
{41246}{41326}Maybe if she owe you more|than she can pay back--
{41362}{41486}You could say that mrs. Macavoy|and i finally are partners.
{41767}{41805}Hooey-Hooey!
{41947}{41987}All right, that's enough,|that's enough.
{41989}{42045}You can get off.
{42077}{42125}Ahhh!
{42334}{42398}All right now, who's next?
{42483}{42583}Malakoma, mr. Costain|is working under my orders.
{42629}{42702}- Do you hear me?|- What is it? What does he want?
{42704}{42772}- He doesn't like you at all.|- He's challenging you.
{42773}{42843}Yeah, he thinks he's|something special around here.
{42909}{43001}All right, partner,|you're something special.
{43031}{43123}Come on, leleo.
{43124}{43160}Come on.
{43162}{43246}Malakoma!
{43335}{43471}If he's looking to get a rise|out of me, he just did it.
{43527}{43608}No, you mustn't!|He'll kill you!
{45445}{45527}Well, you won that one,|all right. Here.
{45529}{45654}Here, let me show you how|we do it where i come from.
{45655}{45771}Now, you get off this|land and don't come back.
{46400}{46451}Come on, leleo, get up there.
{46591}{46669}Come on, leleo.
{46742}{46797}Come on, leleo,|get up there.
{47008}{47091}They're coming, they're coming!
{47093}{47151}Mom, come see! They're here!
{47153}{47217}Come on, they're here!
{48203}{48258}Move! Move, you!
{48260}{48309}Move, move!
{48338}{48385}Ah, thanks, boss.
{48386}{48464}First, the blanket, then the saddle.
{49182}{49229}Where are you going, batton?
{49230}{49287}Booton!
{49289}{49377}Ah, shucks. What's the use?|I can't get the dang thing|to work anyhow.
{49379}{49493}In my outfit, we only quit when|it's too dark to work or time to eat.
{49495}{49553}I didn't hear the|dinner bell, did you?
{49797}{49881}Now, you put the stirrup|up over the horn like this.
{49950}{50005}Ugh!
{50061}{50111}Now, go to work.
{50253}{50300}Put the reins together.|Hold them in one hand.
{50301}{50350}That's it. Get, go on.
{50352}{50440}Would you keep in a circle?|Keep in a circle!
{50441}{50499}Slow down, slow down!
{50501}{50584}Keep your feet in there.
{50586}{50684}Benton, not up and down. Sit|there like a rocking chair.
{50686}{50735}Booton!
{51111}{51176}You wrap it around|and you get it tight.
{51177}{51221}Got that?
{51268}{51329}All right, kimo. It's your turn.
{51331}{51381}Get him, kimo.
{51383}{51430}Yeah, go get him.
{51831}{51933}But they are learning,|actually learning. It's amazing.
{51935}{51996}You're making yourself the|laughing stock of the island.
{51997}{52118}One of the captains was saying they're|even talking about it in lahaina.
{52213}{52260}Good luck.
{52262}{52308}Ya.
{52505}{52575}Ready, boss!
{52576}{52611}Go to it.
{53293}{53375}- What do we do now, boss?|- We could try some card tricks.
{53376}{53458}We fine, boss.|We've not had enough yet.
{53503}{53556}Well, i have.
{53634}{53695}Mr. Costain?
{53803}{53857}Mr. Costain?
{53937}{54007}I'd like you to meet|a friend of mine.|Mr. Bryson, mr. Costain.
{54009}{54060}- Mr. Bryson.|- Mr. Costain.
{54062}{54123}So that's they way you plan|to catch wild cattle?
{54125}{54194}Not exactly, no.
{54195}{54241}Ms. Macavoy, tells me you're new|on the island. Where are you from?
{54243}{54306}- Texas.|- Texas? How did you happen|to come to kauai?
{54307}{54404}I was unhappy|with my last employer.
{54406}{54453}Who was that?
{54455}{54563}Mr. Bryson tells me it's impossible to|load cattle onto boats in these waters.
{54565}{54641}It was tried once|on the big island.
{54643}{54735}Two ships ran on the reefs,|and there is no anchorage|further out.
{54737}{54800}Well, don't they have docks in hilea?
{54802}{54860}Never needed them.
{54862}{54922}Well, how do|they load then?
{54923}{54998}Mostly by long boat.
{55000}{55094}Can you imagine trying to|load cattle by long boat?
{55096}{55194}Well, there's gotta be a way.|Just a matter of findin' it.
{55195}{55268}Mr. Costain says there ain't never|been a horse that ain't been rode,
{55270}{55374}- And ain't never been a rider that ain't been thrown.|- Is that what he says?
{55375}{55478}I won't challenge the statement,|but i will the grammar.
{55480}{55563}Grammar never was my strong suit.
{55565}{55638}Young man, you are sprouting up|like a weed.
{55694}{55733}At least he's got|good rock candy?
{55734}{55811}- I beg your pardon.|- Excuse me.
{56236}{56302}Good morning, boss.
{56350}{56401}Where are they?
{56434}{56490}Oh, boys no tell me, boss.
{56492}{56552}Maybe they go work|someplace else, yes?
{56554}{56683}Yeah, maybe it'll snow|this afternoon too.
{56685}{56742}But i doubt it.
{57949}{58039}Yah! Whee!|Whoo-Hooey!
{58136}{58191}Yee-Haw! Whoo!
{58364}{58420}Let's get out of here!
{58743}{58808}What do you think|you're doing down there?
{58809}{58869}Costain!
{58922}{58969}Whoo-Hoo!
{58971}{59054}Costain!|Look out, Costain!
{59056}{59119}Aaah! Aye!
{59399}{59468}Are you all right, Costain?
{59469}{59557}Fine!
{59559}{59610}Just fine.
{59729}{59821}You just can't expect to change|a whole culture overnight.
{59823}{59897}I don't have|a least notion of changing it.
{59899}{59996}If you just give me my wages,|i won't be troubling you|any further.
{59998}{60064}You know, this is sunday.
{60065}{60128}They're entitled to some recreation.
{60129}{60257}Well, there just ain't any sundays when|it's roundup 'til the job gets done.
{60259}{60335}Well, perhaps if you met them|half way, they would be able--
{60336}{60422}Ma'am, there aren't any "half|ways" in the cattle business
{60424}{60520}It'd be easier to make|a cherry pie out of barbed wire,
{60522}{60578}Than to make a cowboy out|of the best of the lot of 'em.
{60579}{60627}They just ain't cut out for workin'.
{60628}{60663}Booton says they're really trying.
{60665}{60723}That's what's frightening.|They are.
{60725}{60798}- Well, if they're|showing progress--|- They're not showing progress.
{60799}{60859}They're just trying.|It ain't the same thing.
{60861}{60970}Ma'am, suppose i could|whip them into shape.
{60971}{61043}It's not possible,|but just suppose i did.
{61044}{61118}Running cattle is--
{61119}{61187}Well, it's not just|riding and roping,
{61189}{61236}It takes, it takes purpose.
{61238}{61356}And you can't teach that to someone|like you can teach 'em to sit a horse.
{61451}{61545}I figure you owe me $17,|but whatever you think's right.
{61676}{61772}Mr. Costain,
{61774}{61855}I could raise|your salary.
{61887}{61934}It's not the money, ma'am.
{61935}{62008}I think i ought to get back to|texas before i lose all my stitching.
{62010}{62109}I have nightmares about these|people you wouldn't believe.
{62111}{62182}Well, this won't get|you back to texas.
{62183}{62251}Well,|it'll get me started.
{62339}{62399}Couldn't you at least|wait until morning?
{62400}{62460}I mean--
{62462}{62523}I don't know, ma'am.|I don't think so.
{62525}{62645}If i wait around 'til morning,|it'll just make things tougher|than they ought to be.
{62858}{62907}Mrs. Macavoy,
{62998}{63092}There ain't nothin'|personal in all this.
{63094}{63154}You people have been|mighty kind to me.
{63330}{63381}Bye, ma'am.
{63562}{63611}Costain!
{63661}{63718}Costain!
{63819}{63886}Mama, mama!
{63960}{64022}Mama.|Where is he, mama?
{64023}{64076}He's gone, son.
{64078}{64169}- Gone? You mean forever?|- I'm afraid so.
{64170}{64258}But how could you do it?|How could you just let him|go like that?
{64260}{64341}I just didn't let him go.|He's a man, he does|what he wants to.
{64342}{64404}- I couldn't stop him.|- Well, you could've tried.
{64406}{64452}You could've got me up.|I would've made him stay.
{64454}{64543}Booton, please.
{64765}{64835}I bet $20.
{64936}{65027}Twenty and raise twenty.
{65105}{65170}That puts me out. I don't|have anything to bet with.
{65202}{65270}Oh, i wouldn't say that.
{65547}{65643}Five-Card stud, gentlemen.
{66021}{66087}What's he doing here?
{66089}{66161}Taking money away from fools.
{66226}{66297}He's been winning|all night.
{66461}{66553}I see you've found an|easier way to make a living.
{66555}{66618}There's an empty chair|if you feel like sitting in.
{67281}{67331}Ace bets.
{67332}{67413}Don't talk unless|you're in the game.
{67593}{67624}Bet 20.
{68127}{68238}I hope you gentlemen will forgive|me, but i've got a ship to catch.
{68240}{68346}- You leaving the islands?|- Well, thanks to these|gentlemen gamblers.
{68348}{68457}Captain, if you ever dock in fort worth, you|look me up. Give you a chance to get even.
{69051}{69130}You stay.|We be cowboy for you, boss.
{69131}{69196}No swim, no fish,|not even sunday.
{69198}{69283}- We work hard, boss.|- No water slide.|Not any kind of play.
{69285}{69357}They mean it, Costain.|Really.
{69413}{69489}We got clothes good for catch cows.
{69491}{69559}- Our pants no good, boss?|- You stay, boss.
{69561}{69642}- Come on, Costain!|- Please, stay, boss.
{69643}{69746}- Who belongs to this boat?|- Me, mister.
{69747}{69842}Could you row me out|to that ship out there?
{69843}{69915}It's a long row.
{69985}{70065}- Come on, boss!|- Please stay, Costain!
{70067}{70136}- Stay!|- Come on, Costain!
{70195}{70274}Come on, Costain.|Don't go!
{70276}{70357}Come on, Costain.|We promise to work!
{70986}{71089}Costain, i didn't hear the|dinner bell ring, did you?
{71222}{71291}Turn around,|row for shore.
{71823}{71898}And he bought boots for all of them?
{71900}{71978}Yep, with his poker money. He said we just|had to have them if we're gonna run cattle.
{71979}{72025}Look there.
{72162}{72218}Mighty good, boss.
{73168}{73220}Ya-Hoo!
{74181}{74227}- We finished now, boss.|- Good, huh?
{74229}{74275}Yeah, boss.
{74276}{74356}Well, all we gotta do now|is fill it up.
{74544}{74622}That's a great deal|of money, Malakoma.
{74624}{74660}More than you can earn in a year.
{74661}{74760}You did not|get it from me.
{74762}{74847}You didn't come here.|Do you understand?
{74905}{74963}You and Malakoma no talk.
{75002}{75049}That's it.
{75051}{75125}I don't care how you do it,
{75127}{75217}But i don't want those|cattle rounded up for sale.
{75363}{75431}Costain, Costain!
{75644}{75679}Yeah, what is it lily?
{75682}{75741}- Untranslated subtitle -
{75744}{75800}- What?|- Animal in field, boss!
{75802}{75868}Oh, yeah?
{75869}{75925}All right, let's just|see what you've learned?
{75927}{75981}Let's go.
{76301}{76359}Kimo, cut your teeth.
{76436}{76525}Kimo, shake that loop out|and go to it.
{78063}{78146}Kimo, what's wrong?|What happened?
{79388}{79486}How does he know he's dying if he|doesn't even know what's wrong with him?
{79487}{79579}They call it|death by sorcery.
{79613}{79709}- Witch doctor.|- Malakoma is one of them.
{79710}{79789}I don't believe in it, but they|believe in it, and that's what matters.
{79790}{79844}That's why they won't work for you.
{79901}{79946}But why kimo?|It's me he's after.
{79947}{80036}I don't know. I suppose he feels|that's the way to get to you.
{80749}{80817}Liliha, what's the matter|with you, woman?
{80818}{80874}Liliha, Liliha!
{80876}{80945}Liliha, it's Costain.|Now stop it.
{80947}{81025}Malakoma get you, Costain, for sure.
{81026}{81073}You leave here or you die.
{81075}{81145}You just tell me|where he is.
{81147}{81280}Malakoma say two more days,|kimo die, then leleo.
{81281}{81317}I'm not leaving.
{81319}{81391}So if we're gonna|die, we're gonna die.
{81393}{81503}The only chance we have is if|you tell me where Malakoma is.
{81551}{81608}Now tell me, Liliha.
{81674}{81733}Him go taboo ground.
{81735}{81826}Live all alone in|caverns of dead gods.
{88378}{88451}Are you lucky|i need you alive!
{89551}{89646}All right now,|loud and clear, do it.
{89648}{89732}Do whatever it is you have to do, or|you and me are gonna bump heads again.
{89733}{89801}Now, do it!
{90211}{90272}What'd he say, Liliha?
{90274}{90350}He say kimo no die now.|No more anna na.
{90854}{90907}Kimo?
{90972}{91097}- The spell is over.|- You bet it's over, for good.
{91099}{91180}No, no, kimo.|You rest.
{91182}{91248}Yes, miss maka.
{91249}{91300}Booton, you watch him.
{91483}{91594}You better go find yourself|another island, buster. Get goin'.
{91992}{92064}Well, don't stand around.|Show's over.
{92066}{92175}Come on, come on.|We got a lot of work to do.
{92238}{92304}Mr. Costain.
{92306}{92379}They'll never forget you|for what you've done.
{92380}{92435}They'll do anything|for you now.
{92488}{92583}We'll see who forgets who|when the going gets rough,|ma'am.
{92716}{92779}Just remember what|you learned and use it.
{92780}{92835}You might come out of|this day in one piece.
{92836}{92883}Mount up.
{92961}{93007}Well, miss Macavoy,
{93008}{93095}You may or may not own a bunch|of maverick cattle at sundown,
{93096}{93151}But at least you won't|have to wonder anymore.
{93152}{93204}Today's the day|that tells it all.
{93206}{93267}I know, mr. Costain.|Thank you.
{94646}{94748}They're bunched up in the brush.|That ain't good.
{94750}{94834}Don't try to rope 'em in there.|Just haze 'em out in the open,
{94835}{94892}So you can throw|a good loop at 'em.
{94894}{94966}All right,|let's cut the brush.
{95127}{95209}Whoa! Not|the first time, boy.
{95210}{95287}You're ready.|You're not that ready.
{95289}{95378}No, you just hang back,|watch how it goes this time.

{100145}{100195}Yes, ma'am.
{100389}{100479}Hija!|This is just a dry run|to see if it works,

{101727}{101789}Now, ho.
{101791}{101874}Don't let 'em|shift to that side.|They're movin' around.
{101875}{101966}Don't let 'em shift over there.|They're all movin' over there.
{101967}{102035}Keep 'em over. Keep 'em|over to the other side.
{102111}{102212}Don't let-- Don't--|Ugh! Get that brindle|back on the other side.

{102669}{102732}Hija! Hija!
{103671}{103770}You're not so ornery|when you can't get your feet|planted, are ya?
{103926}{104005}You'll tow like|a washtub with horns,
{104007}{104064}But i think you just gave me|the answer, bossy.
{104264}{104324}Yee-Haw!
{104332}{104394}Yee-Haw!
{104396}{104473}What makes you think|you can get them critters|out to the ship?
{104475}{104531}What makes you|think i can't?
{104533}{104598}Well, no one|ever has, lad.
{104600}{104681}That's beside the point. Do you|want the cattle or don't you?
{104683}{104769}Indeed i do, little lady.|As bad as you want to sell 'em.
{104771}{104879}I'll give you 15 dollars|a head, loaded on.
{104881}{104975}Sir, you're a captain,|not a pirate.
{104977}{105059}Twenty dollars a head.|Not a penny less.
{105061}{105107}Alongside.
{105196}{105281}Seventeen-Fifty, on board.|There's no profit in it for me.
{105317}{105368}Uh, a gentleman...
{105369}{105461}Is not supposed to lie|in the presence of a lady.
{105463}{105515}Twenty dollars.
{105517}{105565}Alongside.
{105750}{105852}Upon my word, lad, i wish you|had left the little lady at home.
{105974}{106030}All right, 20 it is, on--
{106032}{106079}- Alongside.|- Alongside.
{106081}{106132}- Thank you very much.|- You're not leaving so soon.
{106134}{106232}We'd love to stay, but we've got|more cattle to sell, haven't we?
{106234}{106294}Yes, indeed we have.|Good day.
{106456}{106555}It's impossible to load|cattle aboard those boats!
{106556}{106663}I would not bet|against that man.|No, not on anything.
{106784}{106856}And he can't deliver|cattle he can't find.
{106858}{106906}Can he?
{106956}{107016}- What?|- Stampede them.
{107056}{107103}Will you do it?
{107104}{107220}Sure, with some guns and a|little help, they'll go, but--
{107941}{108032}It doesn't really hurt 'em.|I mean, they're a tough breed.
{108034}{108154}It's not always true. It just|depends on where you are at the time.
{108343}{108436}You only do that with--|Yearlings...
{108438}{108527}When you know you got|a long winter comin' on.
{108528}{108599}'Course your winter here|only lasts about 20 minutes.
{108601}{108652}What's wrong, Costain?
{108830}{108919}Stampede. Stampede!|Get everybody out of these huts.
{108920}{108979}Everybody out!|Everybody out!
{109263}{109347}Liliha! Stampede. Get all the|women and children to the beach.
{109348}{109404}You men saddle your horses.|Now move! Move!
{109406}{109491}Stampede! Stampede!
{109670}{109715}Go get your mother!
{110009}{110082}Hija! Hija!
{110643}{110715}Liliha, i told you to take|them to the beach. Now go!
{110978}{111042}What can we do?
{111114}{111155}Get under there!
{111929}{111981}You take care of your mother.
{112086}{112136}Hija!
{112696}{112813}Run those leaders!|Run them!
{113049}{113124}Come back!|Stay with me!
{113278}{113365}Oka, kimo, turn 'em!|Turn 'em!
{114147}{114195}Aaah!
{114500}{114547}Marrujo!
{114592}{114668}For two bits, i'd take you|apart and feed you to the hogs,
{114669}{114723}But i need you for somethin' else.
{114724}{114772}Come on.
{115688}{115783}Where the devil|have you been?
{115784}{115847}What happened out there?
{115848}{115925}The stampede, Bryson.
{116079}{116160}It was quite a ruckus.|Should've been out there|yourself.
{116162}{116208}What are you doing here?
{116210}{116268}Gettin' ready|to have you put away.
{116270}{116366}But first there's a matter of|mrs. Macavoy's note. I want it.
{116367}{116474}Note? You can't-- That's a legal|document. She owes that money to me.
{116475}{116554}After tonight,|with the cattle she lost,
{116555}{116626}The grounds and the|buildings getting torn up,
{116627}{116713}I figure you and the lady|are about even, mister.
{116715}{116768}I want the note.
{116770}{116819}Now.
{116821}{116919}All right.|I'll get it for you.
{117994}{118042}What's goin' on?
{118144}{118196}He's all yours.
{118253}{118330}- All right on your feet.|- Come on now, let's go.
{119199}{119250}Hey, watch out now!
{119846}{119911}- Captain.|- Oh, it's good|to see you, ma'am.
{119913}{119965}And especially your merchandise.
{120053}{120137}All right, oka,|throw a loop on one...
{120138}{120199}- And move him out.|- Right away, boss.
{120965}{121030}Hey! Oh-Ho!
{121032}{121089}All right, let him go.
{122979}{123079}Keep pullin'. Steady. Tighten|down now, tighten down.
{123724}{123792}All right, take him out.
{124483}{124561}Well, barrin' tidal waves|and barbary pirates,
{124563}{124648}You're about to be|in the cattle business|all the way.
{124823}{124912}Come to think of it,|i think we could handle|a tidal wave.
{125183}{125251}- Stand by!|- Stand by!
{125343}{125391}Away the sling!
{125866}{125946}- Take him up.|- Hoist him away!
{126316}{126392}- Lower away!|- Lower away!
{126476}{126525}Easy does it, matey.
{126708}{126763}- Steady!|- Steady as she goes.
{127650}{127733}Hey, you know, i think|i sold them boys short...
{127734}{127810}When i said they couldn't|drive hot nails in a snow bank.
{127812}{127881}I think they could.|I really think they could.
{127883}{128001}- Henrietta,|what are you cryin' about?
{128003}{128113}I don't know. I guess i never|really believed it would happen.
{128114}{128200}You made a believer out|of me, Costain, missus.
{128201}{128265}Here's your money.|Coin of the realm.
{128266}{128378}A mate's pay to anyone who will|nursemaid them cows back to california.
{128447}{128528}Well, that's my chance|to get back to texas.
{128565}{128633}I don't know, captain,|that right temptin',
{128634}{128729}But i don't think i could leave mrs.|Macavoy with them pineapple cowboys.
{128730}{128827}They'd drive her dingy, and i'm the only|one around who knows how to handle 'em.
{128829}{128901}Well, suit yourself, lad,|and i don't blame you.
{128902}{128962}But i gotta get them|cows to california.
{128964}{129015}Thanks to both of you.
{129017}{129064}- Good-Bye.|- Good-Bye, now.
{129117}{129213}Then you are going to stay?|At least for a while, linc?
{129241}{129305}Well, for a while, yeah.|For a while.
{129306}{129376}You know, 'til they|get the hang of it.
{129377}{129449}Then i'm gonna get off|this flower pot.
{129450}{129515}Mama! Mama!
{129517}{129578}- Good heavens,|we're right here.|- Tarnation, mom!
{129580}{129669}I swam one of those critters|out just as smooth as butter.
{129671}{129720}- Did you see?|- Of course we did, dear.
{129721}{129779}And nobody could have done it better.
{129781}{129859}Oh, well, now,|that's a little thick,|don't you think?
{129860}{129951}Ain't nobody gonna pin a rose|on you just for doin' your job.
{129952}{129998}You remember that, Booton.
{130000}{130070}Mom, mom, he called me|by my right name!
{130072}{130148}Did you hear him?|He said it right|for the first time!
{130439}{130531}Can we do it together|this time? Can we?
{130532}{130618}Well, can't think|of any reason why not.
{130620}{130672}Throw your loop.

     [machine whirring]         
            [girl] nice landing,
            Uncle Bene.         
                 Right on the   
                 50-yard line.  
[boy] should've gone for a touchdown.                
 Next time, I'll put it         
 right between the goalposts.   
[girl] can't wait to see the museums and go to all the concerts.               
 [Bene] that's why we arranged  
 this little vacation.          
 We've been so busy establishing
 our community on Witch Mountain
    That you two haven't had    
    an opportunity              
 To see what life               
 in the big city is all about.  
I'd rather go to the beach and learn how to surf.          
    [chuckling] there'll be     
    another time for that.      
 Just remember what I told you, 
 and have a lot of fun.         
         - It's locked.         
         - Tia?                 
     Tony, come back here.      
Now, never energize unless it's absolutely necessary.      
Tia?                            
If earth kids can live here without energizing, you can too.
     [tires screeching]         
     [brakes squealing]         
    You the party               
    I'm supposed to pick up?    
 - [Bene] just the children.    
 - All right.                   
    Meter's running, hop in.    
         I got it.              
        [cabbie grunts]         
     I've been                  
     waiting here forever.      
You know, people wait for taxis, not taxis wait for people.      
                 We're exactly  
                 on time.       
Yeah, well, kind of a strange time and place to be making a pick up.         
I mean, if you're here for the next game, it's in three months.
            We have seats       
            on the 50-yard line.
         [Tony laughs]          
            Deliver the children
            to this address.    
             You'll be paid     
             after you arrive.  
This is a big fare here.        
If these kids pay me, I hope they know I get a big tip.      
Now, everything's been arranged.
I'll see you Friday.            
 - Ok. Goodbye, Uncle Bene.     
 - Goodbye.                     
     - Have fun, you two.       
     - [tires screeches]        
[engine revving]                
                 [horn honking] 
     - Look at that dummy.      
     - [honking horn]           
             Get off the road,  
             you dummy.         
                         [sighs]
        These civilians         
        don't know how to drive.
         They ought to be       
         kept off the streets.  
 The streets belong             
 to us professional drivers.    
     Taxis, buses, trucks.      
 That's all that should         
 be allowed on the streets.     
 You see, I happen to know      
 a great deal about driving.    
I have a perfect safety record. 
                 [honking horn] 
            Come on, get out    
            of the way, you bum.
                         [sighs]
        [car doors shut]        
     [woman] thank you.         
     Thank you, sickle.         
Well, this is a perfect test site.            
Little traffic...               
...And low real estate value.              
                 It's adequate, 
                 I suppose.     
Ok, let's get this over with.   
This thing on all right?        
                     It's ready.
     What do you want him       
     to do this time?           
     I want you to              
     climb that fire escape...  
    ...To the absolute top.     
         Wait a minute.         
             Uh-uh.             
    This is as high as I go.    
     You want me to             
     break somebody's leg?      
 Just tell me how many pieces.  
 But up there, I don't go.      
- Why not?                      
- Because I'm afraid of heights.
I will get dizzy.               
I will fall.                    
     That is true, Victor.      
     He has acrophobia...       
     ...Among other things.     
 Find a different test for him. 
    Acrophobia is not           
    a problem with my device.   
        Start climbing.         
I will do anything else you say,
But I am not going up that building, understand?   
         - I...                 
         - Sickle...            
 ...I command you               
 to climb up that fire escape.  
                You will go     
                to the very top,
         You will turn around,  
         and you will look down.
     And you will not           
     be frightened of heights.  
                     Off you go.
                 It's working.  
                 It's working!  
It seems to be.                 
Victor. Victor, you are risking his life.       
He's my nephew.                 
My only living relative.        
He's the only one               
I can leave my...               
...Uh, my bankruptcy to.        
     That's what experimentation
     is all about, Letha.       
[Letha] we cannot afford to lose him.             
     I am the only one          
     we cannot afford to lose.  
 Can't you see that I've got    
 complete control over his mind?
             He has no fear,    
             no memory, no will.
        He can only             
        carry out my commands.  
 - [car rattling]               
 - what... What's happening?    
We're out of gas.               
What are you, crazy? Look at the dial, it points to... Empty.
             Empty?             
     - [exhales]                
     - [horns honking]          
         It was all that waiting
         I had to do for youse. 
 I'll run down the street to the
 gas station and get some gas.  
Boy, oh, boy.                   
         You guys are costing me
         a lot of dough.        
         I sure hope you        
         make the tip worth it. 
Something's going to happen to someone near here.           
             We've got to help. 
No, I think you'd better stay here and wait for the driver.   
I'll go.                        
I think it came from back that way.                  
                     Be careful.
             And remember what  
             Uncle Bene said.   
That is enough.                 
Bring him down!                 
     [victor] sickle,           
     turn to your right.        
        Balance yourself        
                 And walk along 
                 the ledge.     
             [Letha] Victor, no.
             Stop.              
I'll bring him down myself.     
Give that to me.                
     [wires crackling]          
                    Look what   
                    you've done.
     [exhales sharply]          
         Sickle, stop.          
    Sickle, I'm                 
    commanding you to stop.     
 Sickle, this is Dr. Victor     
 Gannon commanding you to stop! 
     - He's out of control.     
     - [Letha] sickle!          
Go back!                        
 [Letha screeching] sickle!     
             No!                
                 Letha... Look. 
        - I can't look.         
        - You must.             
         [footsteps approaching]
        [Letha] it's miraculous.
There are no miracles, Letha.             
Only scientific explanations for everything.                 
Well, then, just explain to me what we're seeing.              
        It... Must be...        
        ...That... Boy.         
    There's a...                
    There's a force that...     
 ...Centers around that boy.    
     A force capable            
     of countermanding          
 The basic physical law of...   
 Gravity.                       
 Victor, I don't know           
 what you're talking about.     
    Molecular mobilization.     
 - I need that boy, Letha.      
 - [horns honking]              
 - I need him desperately.      
 - Now, just a minute.          
             Brilliant, my boy. 
             Brilliant.         
Congratulations, young man, for a fantastic...              
Well, whatever it was you just did,                   
It was absolutely heroic.       
        It was nothing,         
        I just... [gasps]       
     [tires screeching]         
            [sirens approaching]
[dog barks]                     
[helicopter approaching]        
[boy #1] get off the street!                     
        - [boy #2] run!         
        - [boy #3] hide!        
        [boy #4] here come      
        the goon goons!         
         [older boy #1]         
         let's get 'em!         
    [older boy #2]              
    they run like chickens.     
[boy #1] more goons!            
         [boy #2] we're trapped!
[boy #3] hide or they'll get ya.
         Over here.             
[older boy #2] it ain't no use hiding behind those trash cans. 
[older boy #1] the earthquakes' got girls in their gang.        
             Let's finish 'em.  
     [older boy #1] hey!        
[older boy #2] now, where in the world did that come from?
        It was a set up.        
    - Let's give it to 'em.     
    - Yeah.                     
         - [all yell]           
         - hey!                 
         [laughing]             
     That was an ambush!        
     [older boy #2]             
     stop banging into me.      
 [older boy #1] I can't see.    
[older boy #3]                  
I can't get out.                
 [older boy #4] get me out.     
 Get it off me.                 
    [boys] yeah! All right!     
Hey, you really saved us from getting wiped out.         
             Yeah, thanks a lot.
     - What's your name?        
     - Tia.                     
         - I'm Rocky.           
         - I'm muscles.         
     - Crusher.                 
     - And I'm dazzler.         
 We're the earthquake gang.     
            Does that scare you?
             - No.              
             - Aww.             
Let's change our name again.                 
We gotta have a name that scares.             
            - Yeah.             
            - Hey.              
 How'd you do what you done?    
     Well, I really             
     didn't do anything.        
     Yeah. You a magician       
     or something?              
             No.                
 You want to join our gang?     
    I'm sorry.                  
    I'm looking for someone.    
        - Thanks anyway.        
        - Aw, sure.             
     I guess you're like        
     the rest of them.          
     You've heard               
     we're a nothing gang.      
    Yeah, well we ain't         
    always gonna be nothing.    
     Someday we're gonna        
     be the toughest.           
 Take over the whole territory. 
    Someday they're gonna run   
    when they see us            
    coming down the block.      
         All right.             
    It's just that              
    I've got to find my brother.
 What gang does he belong to?   
- He doesn't belong to any gang.
- [boys snicker]                
 I never heard of a Guy         
 that never belonged to a gang. 
 I'm sure something's happened. 
 I've got to find him.          
    If anybody could find him,  
    we could.                   
     I mean, we know            
     this town inside out.      
         Oh, would you?         
        Hey, yeah, sure.        
Listen, you done us a big favor, now we'll do it for you.        
     Thank you.                 
     Thank you very much.       
    Hey, come on, let's go.     
            That Tony sure      
            made himself scarce.
 - We better walk you home.     
 - Where do you live?           
I... I was supposed to stay at a hotel.                
But I don't know which one.                      
        You could stay          
        in our hideout.         
         - [boys] yeah!         
         - Thank you.           
     We'll look                 
     for Tony tomorrow.         
     If we aren't busy          
     beating up goons.          
     - Yeah.                    
     - Hey, it's yo-yo.         
        - Get down.             
        - Come on, hide.        
        - Did he see us?        
        - I don't know.         
 - But he's coming this way.    
 - [Tia] who is he?             
 - [muscles] our worst enemy.   
 - He's worse than the goons.   
 [Rocky] he's Mr. Yokomoto,     
 the truant officer.            
         He's trying to make us 
         go back to school.     
     [dazzler] let's go.        
         [all] yeah!            
             That's our hideout.
     [stairs creaking]          
[Tia] when do the ghosts get here?            
        [Rocky] don't say things
        like that.              
        This place could        
        really scare ya.        
            [gasps]             
Come on.                        
 This is where we're gonna live 
 when we run away from home.    
        Yeah, you can't be tough
     If you take orders from    
     your mom or older sister.  
        That's why              
        we quit school.         
     You can't be tough         
     and educated, too.         
[crusher] yeah.                 
        - Tony!                 
        - [boys] where?         
 I had a contact with him.      
You...                          
You calling on the spirits?     
             Shh.               
        - She's weird.          
        - She's creepy.         
    I... I ain't too sure       
    I wanna meet this Tony.     
             Shh!               
     Tony, where are you?       
     He's coming in again.      
    I can only see a light.     
    That's all.                 
    Now it's... Going black.    
 Now it's... Completely gone.   
     [machines beeping]         
                He's doing that?
He's projecting a magnetic field through his reflexes            
As he struggles to regain consciousness.        
His output is so great,         
That my machines aren't even capable of measuring it.   
             But he's dangerous.
Once I have control of his brain, Letha,            
He will only be dangerous to others.         
I hope you realize that kidnapping's a criminal offense.
My experiments are more important than the law, Letha.  
With these receptors placed on certain people,       
Combined with this boy's powers,              
I could become one of the most influential men in the world.   
         Oh, you are absolutely 
         brilliant, professor.  
             Now we can go ahead
             with my plans, too.
Don't bother me with your plans.
They're empty, unimportant.     
 A comment, perhaps, on you and 
 the life you've been leading.  
             Now, you look here,
    Doctor, professor,          
    physicist. Whatever you are.
     I built this laboratory    
     for you at great expense.  
     I used every penny I had.  
 Now, we've made a lot of plans 
 and I won't let you upset them.
        I want some money. Fast.
Letha, we are worlds apart.                   
My mind is filled with large concepts.            
Mankind, the universe.          
You only worry about the horse that's running in the third race.      
            Sure, I gamble...   
     ...But with my own money.  
                You're the worst
                kind of gambler.
            You use             
            other people's money
     And want to keep all       
     the winnings for yourself. 
         Well, you can be sure  
         of one thing, Victor.  
     I'll be around to pick up  
     the chips with you.        
    - [wires pop and sizzle]    
    - [Tony moans]              
         [panting]              
         [grunting]             
    We'll be back in the morning
    with maps and breakfast.    
I'll bring an egg from my refrigerator.           
             And I'll bring some
             day-old bread.     
- I'll bring some milk for you. 
- Thank you.                    
 - You're good friends.         
 - That's the trouble with us.  
 We don't want to be good.      
 We want to be bad.             
             Yeah.              
 Hey, uh, let's go, you guys.   
 My mom's gonna yell at me.     
[crusher] see you tomorrow,     
Tia.                            
 [muscles] we'll find Tony      
 tomorrow for sure.             
 [Rocky] let's stay close       
 together on the way out, guys. 
            [sighs]             
                         Good.  
             This is            
             professor Gannon...
             ...Commanding you  
             to awaken.         
[indistinct shouting]           
                         Tony!  
 He's in some kind of a room.   
                Like a hospital.
     With machines              
     and instruments and things.
Oh, that's easy.                
All we have to do is check all the hospitals.     
     While we going around      
     looking for a fight.       
            Come on.            
 [victor] you will now function 
 exclusively under control.     
            You will no longer  
            think independently.
     All thinking and reasoning 
     will be done               
             By the voice       
             that commands you. 
             Do you understand? 
     - Yes.                     
     - What is your name?       
     - Tony.                    
     - Where are you from?      
Witch mountain.                 
        Sounds like             
        some hick town to me.   
         How did you suspend    
         Mr. Sickle in mid-air? 
     By energizing matter.      
Do you mean to say that you can control molecular flow? 
         Yes, sir.              
- How did you learn to do this? 
- I was born with the ability.  
 I wish to see a demonstration  
 of molecular flow.             
                You are strapped
                to the table.   
             Unbuckle yourself  
             and sit up.        
         Power has come         
         into our hands         
     Which is centuries         
     before its time.           
We must use it wisely.          
                Well, what can  
                you have him do?
     Other than go around making
     people's belts unbuckle.   
The possibilities are unlimited.
     Oh, come on. It's just     
     some gimmick, that's all.  
Tony...                         
         Mr. Sickle,            
         whose life you saved,  
             Doesn't seem       
             to believe in you. 
         Mr. Sickle             
         needs convincing, Tony.
[knob squeaks]                  
         [gas hissing]          
         Hey, come on.          
Hey, get back!                  
     Get back! Get back!        
Don't.                          
[grunting] get back!                       
[goat bleats]                   
I can see how that'd be a big hit at a scientific convention. 
But the bottom line is, how do we make money with it?   
[goat bleats]                   
     I will demonstrate         
     an industrial application. 
Come with me, Tony.             
         [gas continues to hiss]
             Now, Tony,         
             those wine casks...
         Stack them... Neatly.  
            Two glasses         
            of burgundy, please.
                 To molecular   
                 mobilization.  
 To molecular capitalization.   
        - [goat bleats]         
        - [gas hisses]          
[muscles] hey, got any more clues?             
             No.                
        Nothing at all.         
        It's so strange.        
 We've been to every hospital   
 and he's in none of them.      
             It's like          
             his mind's a blank.
He probably conked out somewhere.           
 - Don't listen to him.         
 - We'll find Tony for sure.    
     Yeah, we'll turn           
     the town upside down.      
Yeah.                           
 - [sickle] what're you doing?  
 - [Letha] thinking.            
Thinking about us in a different place, such as...   
Las Vegas...                    
...With Tony.                   
             Seven or eleven    
             every time, right? 
A day at the races.             
             All the long shots  
             come in.           
[laughs] you do have an imagination, after all.      
The possibilities with Tony are unlimited.        
For example, he stacked the wine casks by just looking at them.  
If he can stack them, he can unstack them.            
         The gold is on display 
         at the museum.         
    Protected by an impenetrable
    security system.            
             Just sitting there 
             waiting for us...  
             ...To penetrate it.
Wait a minute. Us?              
You mean Gannon said it's ok to use the control on Tony?     
 Professor Gannon is            
 extremely busy being a genius. 
 I own half the invention,      
 Half of Tony, that means       
 I own half of the profits.     
     So far, the return on      
     my investment has been     
     half of zero.              
What about security. We'd need an army to pull it off.    
     We'll have an army with us!
             Tony.              
         [chuckles]             
              Tony?             
              Tony?             
      Tony, why can't I         
      get through to you?       
              Tony?             
I'll pick up the new transistors, make a few stops.  
Be back later on.               
            [Letha] don't worry.
                 Everything's   
                 under control. 
            Tony.               
            This is Letha wedge,
             Commanding you     
             to open your eyes. 
                 Now, stand up. 
     We're going to the museum  
     for education and profit.  
        [brakes squeak]         
        Tony and I will do      
        a little... Sightseeing.
     [indistinct chatter]       
                     [Tia] wait.
     Gold! I see gold.          
        - Hey it's mine.        
        - Where is it?          
     - Hey, give it to me!      
     - No!                      
         A stagecoach.          
     She must be tuned in       
     on a western.              
                         Yeah.  
         I see dummies.         
     [both] that's you.         
        No. Old things.         
                     Clothing.  
             Hey, he's at       
             the salvation army.
Nah, they don't got stagecoaches at the salvation army.          
            They don't got gold,
            neither.            
                Wait a minute,  
                wait a minute!  
         We had one of them     
         nothing school trips.  
                 To the museum. 
                 Yeah, they got 
                 a pile of gold.
And a stagecoach.               
They had to kick me out.        
     We've got to go there.     
                 Come on,       
                 it's over here.
        [kids grunting]         
     [indistinct chatter]       
        [tires screech]         
Now, Tony.                      
We're going to create a little diversion.             
The stagecoach.                 
I want you to roll it all around the museum.          
[woman gasps]                   
[woman] look out.               
                 [man] watch it.
[man] watch out for that thing, it's coming this way.           
Hey, where are the horses?                     
                I... Don't know.
Now cause total chaos.          
                [man] watch out.
            [yelps]             
Short circuit the control system.             
    [control system buzzes]     
     [indistinct yelling]       
        [guard screams]         
            Oh, no.             
             Letha!             
             Letha!             
     [indistinct shouting]      
[chortling]                     
         - [gasps]              
         - look out.            
        [man] get out of my way.
         [moaning]              
         [guards yell]          
[man] can't you put that thing out?                 
Come on, take a shot.           
Move it.                        
Now, Tony,                      
Make a hole in the plastic shield.          
And it doesn't have to be neat. 
Tony, unstack the gold bars and deliver them to Mr. Sickle. 
 [man] move it buddy, move it.  
 We gotta get out of here!      
Las Vegas, here we come.                   
             Oh!                
     - Look.                    
     - [bars thudding]          
                     Come on,   
                     follow me. 
Tony, make them go faster.                      
     [woman] watch out!         
    Hey, Letha! Hey, Letha!     
     - [woman screams]          
     - [man] hey!               
     [indistinct chatter]       
        Look out, lady.         
Yeah, why don't you watch where you're going, you big dummy.    
            [gasps]             
     [man] look out, Eddie!     
[Letha] Tony, what's happening? 
[Tony] molecular flow reversing.
     - Are you doing this?      
     - No.                      
Then who is?                    
             It would have to be
             one of my people.  
 - There are more like you?     
 - Yes.                         
 - Oh! Let's get out of here.   
 - [Tia] Tony!                  
             Tony!              
Who's that?                     
                 It's my sister.
                 My sister, Tia.
This is no time for a family reunion.           
     [crowd murmuring]          
[victor] Letha!                 
             Tony!              
         [victor] you fool!     
         How could you do this? 
        [Letha] not now.        
     - [door shuts]             
     - [engine sticking]        
        - What's wrong?         
        - I don't know.         
 I keep it running perfect.     
It's Tony's sister, she did it. 
She's as weird as he is.        
     Tony, I command you to     
     make this car run perfectly
 And continuously without       
 interference from your sister. 
        [engine starts]         
     I can't stop the car.      
     Tony's energizing it.      
         It's like your brother 
         doesn't even know you. 
- [Rocky] it's yo-yo. Let's go! 
- No. Don't run.                
     You crazy? You don't want  
     to go to that school.      
     Please, trust me.          
     Now, come on, hurry.       
 [Rocky] hey, wait for me.      
 [dazzler] come on, you guys.   
 Get in there.                  
     - Let's go!                
     - Come on, get in.         
        - [door shuts]          
        - I'm dreaming.         
 You're surrendering            
 to the board of education?     
Sir, you see that car going down the street?          
     - Yeah.                    
     - My brother's in it.      
He ought to be going to school. 
You ought to catch up with him. 
    Another truant? Oh, boy,    
    we're gonna have a load.    
     - Hey, what happened?      
     - Good driving, yo-yo.     
Yeah, that was neat.            
             [laughs] this bus  
             can really move.   
             Tony, look         
             through the window.
                The rear window.
                That minibus    
                is following us.
         I command you to place 
         obstacles in its path. 
         [tires squeal]         
     City property.             
     I've damaged city property.
                     [moaning]  
[panting] they said these glasses were shatterproof.
 Was that a bus or a bridge?    
         They're still with us. 
        Tony, you must stop her.
Man, that man was really buzzing.                 
     Am I still alive?          
        [tires screech]         
         They're gaining on us. 
     She counteracts            
     everything that Tony does. 
                Tony, you've    
                got to stop her.
                        We flew!
        [boys cheering]         
             They must've flown.
Don't you dare try it.                    
     Sickle... Sickle, stop...  
     Stop over that hill.       
 Tony, cause the reflection     
 of the sun on the rear window  
             To magnify and     
             shine so brightly  
            That our pursuers'll
            be blinded by it.   
        [glass breaking]        
             [van scrapes road] 
[muscles] come on, open the doors.                 
     [crusher] I can't see.     
- [Tia] yeah.                   
- [muscles] come on, let me out.
    - Everybody ok?             
    - [all kids] yeah, sure.    
        Oh, look what's happened
        to city property.       
No... But I'm still gonna take you to school.       
     - Just soon as I...        
     - Come on.                 
     [siren approaching]        
You jeopardized my life's work. 
My accountants' are desperate.                  
         You've proved yourself 
         incompetent yet again. 
        I don't even know if    
        I can trust you anymore.
You don't trust me?             
I trusted you enough            
To make my credit rating look like Swiss cheese.         
Don't tell me you don't trust me.             
We have to trust each other.               
     Right.                     
     I trust everybody.         
             Yes...             
             Well, fortunately, 
         I thought of something 
         very spectacular       
 Which will satisfy both of us  
 in terms of prestige and money.
Well, you have the prestige,    
I'll take the money.            
But, before we celebrate your return to sanity,          
We'd better do something about Tony's sister.            
     How did she know           
     we were at the museum?     
                I...            
                I'm not certain.
Tony.                           
How did your sister know that we were at the museum?     
         Telepathy.             
            She'll show up again
            and ruin everything.
In that case, she will have to be, as you would say... 
...Scratched?                   
     [Tony whispering] Tia.     
          [louder] Tia.         
              Tia!              
  [Tia] what happened to you?   
  [Tony] I can't explain now.   
     I've lost                  
     the power to energize.     
      [Tia] where are you?      
  [Tony] follow my voice path.  
  Please!                       
      [Tia] ok. Guide me.       
         [dog barks]            
      Tony, which way?          
              [Tony] this way.  
        [sirens blaring]        
      Which way, Tony?          
      Which way?                
 [Tony] keep moving             
 straight ahead.                
      This is the house.        
          Here, look.           
          Come on.              
        - [door closes]         
        - down here.            
                 [goat bleats]  
     Be quiet, Alfred,          
     you silly thing.           
          [Tony] Tia!           
             Tony!              
            [yells]             
         [gas hissing]          
     I've put her into a state  
     of comatose neutralization.
 [crusher] hey, Tia.            
 We got you some cold hotcakes. 
        She ain't here.         
 Hope she didn't go             
 looking for Tony without us.   
             Yeah, she needs us.
      [Tia] Tony? Crusher?      
         Muscles? Rocky?        
      - Dazzler?                
      - [Alfred bleats]         
             Alfred.            
  Alfred,                       
  what's the matter with me?    
          Where am I?           
  Alfred, find the earthquakes. 
         [bleating]             
         Listen to me.          
         [bleating]             
    [hoof steps approaching]     
         [bleating]             
     [sickle] what kind         
     of place is that?          
 [victor] that is an underground
 plutonium processing plant.    
         Translate that         
         into financial terms.  
Plutonium is more valuable than gold.        
             That's why         
             I like scientists. 
     They're always discovering 
     new, expensive things.     
It is used in the explosive core of nuclear missile warheads.    
             I suppose you're   
             going to have Tony 
             Split an atom bomb 
             or something.      
In effect...                    
...Yes                          
         Well, I didn't count on
         killing anybody.       
             Especially not us. 
It will never go that far.      
They will pay anything to prevent it.         
This is the first step towards my becoming             
The most powerful man in the world.                   
         Ids, please.           
         Take a powder.         
                     [laughing] 
Tony.                           
Those are the outer security scanners.        
 Put them out of commission...  
        ...Permanently.         
            [static]            
            The scanning systems
            are malfunctioning. 
            All right, let's run
            a maintenance check.
Three million bucks, you'd think these things would work right.  
    - Where to?                 
    - Andy's place, know it?    
Yeah, sure. I know where everything is. Second and third?
 - [man] fourth and market.     
 - That one.                    
 - Hop in.                      
 - I'm in a hurry. Could you... 
            [grunts]            
        - Don't worry.          
        - [tires screech]       
    Have you there              
    in a couple of minutes.     
[Alfred bleats]                 
            Listen.             
 Feel the power in this cab?    
    - [Alfred bleats]           
    - it has lots of power.     
 You know, everybody tells me,  
 I ought to be a race driver.   
     - What do you think?       
     - [bleats]                 
 Well, I think you're wrong.    
Don't worry about nothing, sir. 
I'm a very safe driver.         
- Want me to tell you how safe? 
- [Alfred bleating]             
     I'll tell you anyway.      
 I've been driving a hack       
 for 19 years and 11 months.    
 And in all that time, I never  
 even put one scratch on a cab. 
     In fact, next month,       
     They're gonna give me      
     a gold safety award.       
 - What do you think of that?   
 - [bleating]                   
 Boy, you don't like nothing.   
     - I sure hope              
     you're a good tipper.      
     - [bleats]                 
I knew there was something about you that didn't look right.     
     [tires screeching]         
[cabbie] hey!                   
             Hey!               
     You owe me a fare!         
                 [cabbie sighs] 
 - Officer, that goat's a guy.  
 - The goat?                    
         The guy became a goat  
         when I'm driving.      
The guy?                        
     This magician              
     beat me out of this fare.  
The magician?                   
    - My perfect record.        
    - Record? Oh... Record.     
         I ain't gonna get      
         the gold safety award. 
 - [hoof steps approaching]      
 - hear that? That must be her. 
         - [bleats]             
         - come on.             
 [boys grunting and panting]    
     [dazzler] help me.         
[grunts] hey. Watch out.        
        - [bleating]            
        - get him away.         
    - [moans]                   
    - how'd you get in here?    
        Hey, come on,           
        get out of here.        
[Rocky] watch out!              
             He's looking at me 
             like he knows me.  
 Hey, what do you want from me? 
                     Get away!  
     He's got Tia's vest.       
            Get him!            
             Quick.             
  - [phone ringing]             
  - we're going for coffee now. 
    - [phone ringing]           
    - can I bring you a cup?    
     May I see your ids, please?
Tony?                           
Show him our id.                
     What's happening?          
Why?                            
    Don't leave me up here.     
                Open the door,  
                Tony.           
     You can't go in there      
     without ids.               
     - Now seal it.             
     - How do I get down?       
         [boys panting]         
             Tia!               
 - Quick, let's get her out.    
 - Yeah.                        
     - Phew, it smells.         
     - [boys cough]             
It's some kind of a gas.                       
Come on.                        
        [inhales deeply]        
         You ok now?            
        Yes, thank you.         
    This is some kind of...     
     ...Science place.          
     - How'd you get here?      
     - It was Tony.             
                    He was here.
        I saw something!        
         What was it?           
        It's where Tony is.     
        I'm sure of it!         
     A big, round shape.        
A doughnut!                     
He's eating a doughnut.         
No way!                         
     Is it like a ball?         
     A great big ball?          
     - Yes.                     
     - I know where he is.      
         Let's go!              
        Hurry, let's go.        
                 [Alfred bleats]
     Oh, thank you.             
     And thanks for everything. 
     Come on, let's go.         
We are about to make scientific history.     
         [Letha] and some money,
         too, I hope.           
You will shut down the complete cooling system of the furnace.  
[alarm ringing]                 
It's a red light on the cooling system.          
     It must be                 
     a circuit breaker.         
     Restart the system.        
I can't get a restart.          
         Hit the backup system. 
It's no-go on backup.           
Temperature increasing in the furnace.                 
 - Get that coolant flowing.    
 - [phone buzzes]               
     - Furnace control.         
     - Control?                 
 You don't really think you're  
 controlling anything, do you?  
 - [alarm continues buzzing]    
 - who is this?                 
      [victor] this is          
      Dr. Victor Gannon,        
  And I have just shut down     
  your cooling system.          
        Ok, you've shut it down.
        Get it back on again!   
        Tell him how expensive  
        it is to put it back on.
In exactly one hour, we shall be serving grilled plutonium,      
Medium rare, to the atmosphere unless the following conditions are met.   
        What conditions?        
Five million dollars in cash.                        
A jet waiting at the airport.   
A safe escort, of course.       
And most important of all,      
You will announce that Dr. Victor Gannon          
Has achieved molecular control and mind control.               
And this is the first of a series of worldwide demonstrations of his power.    
        [line cuts out]         
 How long does it take          
 to count five million dollars? 
        [alarm ringing]         
     [indistinct yelling]       
        [siren wailing]         
     [indistinct shouting]      
     [machines beeping]         
We'll have to pay them.         
 Evacuate the immediate area.   
 Put Los Angeles on alert.      
         [horn honking]         
There's the big round ball.                 
 - Is that it?                  
 - No, it was bigger than that. 
        Get outta here.         
            Leave me alone.     
            At least I tried.   
                     Hey, look. 
It's yo-yo.                     
Let's get out of here.          
            Come on.            
             [radio plays music]
 Hey, yo-yo.                    
 Don't you want to catch us?    
I don't trust him.              
He's probably using some psychology trick on us.    
            Come on.            
[dazzler] hey, Mr. Yo-yo, don't you want to catch us?     
        It's not my job anymore.
             They're coming down
             to fire me...      
             ...For destroying  
             city property.     
The only thing that works is the radio. And it won't turn off.   
     I was only trying          
     to help you kids.          
         Mr. Yokomoto,          
 I'm sorry about                
 everything that's happened.    
 All I ever wanted in life      
Was all you kids that           
I put back in school, someday...
     ...Visit me and say,       
 "thanks Mr. Yo-yo, Yokomoto.   
 If it wasn't for you           
 forcing us to get an education,
    We would've been bums."     
     That's all I wanted.       
You see?                        
I told you he was gonna...      
 ...Hit us with                 
 some of that heavy psychology. 
     I mean, I feel guilty.     
     [man on radio] bulletin    
     from the plutonium plant.  
  Unless the demands            
  of the terrorists are met,    
 The furnace will explode       
 with the force of ten megatons.
  An official describes         
  the atomic furnace controls   
  as frozen in position,        
 - As if "the molecular flow..."
 - that's Tony!                 
- The plant is being evacuated. 
- That's where he is!           
    - We've got to go there.    
    - How? Take a bus?          
 - We'll go in this.            
 - Tia, the tires are flat.     
            Come on.            
        [tires screech]         
     [machine beeping]          
If it doesn't start cooling soon,             
The chain reaction will start.                     
                 You hear that? 
                 In ten minutes,
     This place is going to be  
     a hole in the ground.      
     Now, let's be reasonable.  
We have three and a half million dollars in the control room.    
 And the balance is on the way. 
                    It's a deal.
I do not compromise.            
     [alarm continues]          
- Hey, what are you guys doing? 
- [man] nothing! Nothing!       
     We're doing nothing.       
         - Hey, kids!           
         - [man grunts]         
How did these children get past security?              
 Sir, the people destroying the 
 furnace kidnapped my brother.  
             If I could see him,
             I might stop them. 
    - [boys] she can do it!     
    - She can do it.            
        - [alarm beeps]         
        - do what?              
Impossible, they're inside the room.        
They've sealed the door somehow.               
- What part has to be fixed?    
- The emergency cooling system. 
     - Where is it?             
     - Five levels down.        
But it's too late. We've already begun to evacuate the plant.    
Tony's here, all right.                      
         Get me down.           
 Thank you, thank you.          
 Now, where are you going?      
                     In there.  
Oh, no. You can't go beyond this point without ids.  
 - [footsteps approaching]      
 - [Tia] Tony!                  
         - Tia!                 
         - I knew it.           
 She'll spoil everything.       
 I can just taste that money.   
     We cannot let her          
     take it away from us.      
                         Tony!  
 Tony, from this moment         
 you will no longer hear Tia.   
    She cannot break through    
    my power of control.        
 - Acknowledge.                 
 - [Tia] Tony, what's wrong?    
          It's me, your sister. 
             Try to remember me.
         Acknowledge.           
              Tony?             
     - Yes, sir.                
     - Get those kids.          
        She'll use some of those
        molecules on us.        
I'll take care of her before she gets a Chance, you get them.
 [Tia] I can't get through.     
     I don't know what          
     they've done to his mind.  
 We've got to find the emergency
 cooling system ourselves.      
 How do you spell cooling?      
                        Come on.
     - [Tia] uh-oh.             
     - [muscles] whoa.          
             [Rocky] look out.  
     [rapid footsteps approach] 
    We've got to find           
    the emergency switches.     
    You two go that way,        
    and you two go that way.    
                 Tony, we must  
                 eliminate Tia. 
[footsteps approach]            
 You will cause that portable   
 utility panel to run her down. 
     - Hey, Tia, come here.     
     - [machines whirring]      
            Come on.            
     That ain't it, right?      
     - [Tia] you found it!      
     - I knew it was it!        
     But, it's spelt wrong.     
            You guys get        
            dazzler and muscles.
         Ok. Come on.           
                 [door opening] 
         The rest of the money's
         just arrived.          
         All right.             
    I'd better call Gannon.     
The cooling system's on.        
         Switch it off.         
     [man] we lost it!          
 What's going on down there?    
             It's coming back.  
            Gotcha!             
    Tony, you must stop her.    
             Tony, why are you  
             doing these things?
    Why are you using           
    your powers against me?     
                What's happened?
                         Tony...
                ...Pretend      
                to remember Tia.
     Lure her to the            
     center of the room and...  
             ...Make that crane 
             drop on her.       
             Tia!               
 I'm starting to remember.      
                What was the    
                matter with you?
I don't know, exactly... But... 
         I need help.           
     Don't go any closer.       
     Why? What is it, Tony?     
         Tony, stop it!         
         Stop it, Tony, stop it!
Exert a force greater than hers.              
 Why are you doing this, Tony?  
 Stop.                          
                    Crush her.  
                    Kill her!   
                     Crush her! 
         Crush her! Crush her!  
                     Finish her!
     - Now!                     
     - [Tony groaning]          
Tia.                            
Where are we?                   
What's happened?                
        [victor screams]        
         - Ha!                  
         - [boys yell]          
                 [victor] Tony. 
     Tony, we can still do it.  
         We can still make use  
         of molecular control.  
Ok, doc, let's do it.                    
         [moaning]              
         [grunting]             
            [footsteps approach]
         [boys pant]            
        [victor] Letha!         
    Why don't we                
    all go and have some...     
     Some candy and, uh,        
     sodas and ice cream?       
[Letha moans]                   
                    Next time...
     - ...Next time I'll...     
     - Forget it.               
I've lost my faith in science.  
     - [sickle grunts]          
     - huh?                     
         [boys moan]            
        [victor] sickle!        
[moaning]                       
        Aunt Letha!             
        Oh, aunt Letha.         
             Help.              
     [gasping] aunt Letha?      
     Aunt Letha?                
It's absolutely dreadful the way they bring up children these days.            
     - Come on.                 
     - [engine shuts off]       
         Tony, the bus won't run
         without me in it.      
             It's all my fault. 
             It's such a mess.  
Well, I guess we'll just have to fix it.            
             I'm sure Uncle Bene
             won't mind.        
         I'll do the engine.    
         You do the body work.  
     - Ok.                      
     - So long, Alfie.          
     - Goodbye, Alfred.         
     - [blows kiss]             
[bleats]                        
     What job will you do now,  
     Mr. Yo-yo, uh, Yokomoto?   
    Oh, I've saved my money.    
    I'll probably open          
    a Japanese delicatessen.    
     - [metal scraping]         
     - hey, kids, look.         
    I don't understand this.    
     - Man!                     
     - Wow, what a family.      
The molecules must have rearranged themselves...        
 - ...Somehow.                  
 - Uh, that's a possibility.    
     You know what this means?  
     They never saw the wreck.  
 I'll tell them that the reports
 were exaggerated.              
         And, if you kids       
         will go back to school,
                 I'm sure they  
                 won't fire me. 
You will go back to school, won't you?                      
         Well, if we was        
         to go back to school,  
         Could we get as smart  
         as Tia and Tony?       
     - Maybe even smarter.      
     - Yeah, sure.              
Let's give it a shot.           
             Great.             
 I hope the school can take it. 
     - Goodbye, yo-yo.          
     - Goodbye.                 
- [Rocky] see you later, yo-yo. 
- You promised.                 
     Tia, open the gate.        
 No, everybody join hands.      
            - Whoa.             
            - Wow.              
         [boys] cool!           
[muscles] all right!            
Wow! Flying saucer!             
Will we ever see you again?                  
                 Well, it's...  
                    It's kind of
                    hard to say.
Thanks for everything.          
     And especially for         
     letting me be in your gang.
Take care of Alfred for me, ok?                     
         [all laugh]            
There you are.                  
    - Where's your luggage?     
    - Uh, we lost it.           
                 There were     
                 a few problems.
    - But you did have fun?     
    - Oh, terrible.             
I just knew we should have gone surfing.       
     [mechanical whirring]      
         [all] wow.             
Hey. Let's do it the way        
Tia and Tony taught us.         
         [all] yeah.            
    - Ready?                    
    - [all] one, two, three!    
         [all grunt]            
         - Hey, yo-yo!          
         - Yo-yo!               
         [panting] guess what!  
     Tia and Tony just drove off
     in a flying saucer.        
        - Flying saucer?        
        - Whoosh!               
Whoosh?                         
How about whooshing yourself into the bus?          
                 But, it's true.
    Lookit, I saw those two kids
    do miraculous things.       
I believe anything and everything, except that. Get in.
     I hope this school teaches 
     about flying saucers.      
Yeah.                           
                Flying saucers.

{4356}{4382}When I give|the word!
{4388}{4423}Now, are you|ready with your cork, sir?
{4429}{4481}A great|big smile! Beautiful!
{4499}{4518}Ready?
{4524}{4559}Oh, dear,|oh dear, oh...
{4565}{4609}oh, oh, oh...|this is awful.
{4747}{4797}Oh, David,|take us with you.
{4804}{4822}Sorry,|Maisie.
{4828}{4844}No passengers|allowed.
{4850}{4886}Tell you what, Innes.|I'll bet you 50 guineas
{4892}{4937}my coach and four'll|beat you to the other side.
{4943}{4988}Good idea! While|you're galloping over the top
{4994}{5038}we'll be drilling|through the middle.
{5048}{5103}That'll do.|Stop there.
{5156}{5189}Thank you.
{5210}{5216}Doc?
{5222}{5253}Oh, David,|my dear fellow,
{5261}{5285}what a proud|moment this is.
{5291}{5355}I hope your faith|in me will be fully justified.
{5366}{5390}I just made|a wager.
{5396}{5420}A little champagne|to success?
{5426}{5474}Oh, yes,|I'll... I'll drink to that.
{5495}{5532}Oh, no.|I'd better not.
{5538}{5557}I-I'm at|the controls
{5563}{5610}and you must keep|a clear head, too, David.
{5625}{5660}Winterbottom...|Mr. Innes, sir.
{5678}{5714}Dowsett,|of the times.
{5720}{5751}How do you do, sir?|How do you do?
{5757}{5778}This is dr.|Abner Perry.
{5784}{5815}How do you do?|How do you do, sir?
{5821}{5847}Dr. Perry|was kind enough
{5853}{5891}to nominate me|as his worst student.
{5897}{5928}It took me|longer to graduate
{5934}{5964}from geological|engineering
{5970}{5987}than any other|man alive.
{5993}{6040}Oh, but you|had many fine qualities, David.
{6053}{6086}But you were|rather slow.
{6092}{6122}And that is|rather surprising
{6128}{6170}because his|father was so clever.
{6176}{6206}One of the best|we ever had
{6212}{6257}in, uh, '58,|I think it was.
{6272}{6297}Oh, yes,|yes, '58.
{6303}{6325}Dear old dad.
{6331}{6379}He should've|been here to see the mole.
{6385}{6420}Ah, that is|what you call it?
{6426}{6451}The... the|"iron mole"?
{6457}{6479}That's what|I call it.
{6485}{6508}Dr. Perry here,|calls it
{6514}{6551}a high-calibration|digging machine.
{6557}{6599}It'll bore|through solid rock
{6605}{6655}at a rate|of 78 feet per minute.
{6662}{6709}And this is|your design, dr. Perry?
{6715}{6747}The finance has|been provided
{6753}{6785}by Mr. Innes,|I gather.
{6791}{6805}Oh, pardon me.
{6811}{6854}David,|gyroscopes.
{6860}{6886}I know that|today is just
{6892}{6922}a test-run through|our welsh hills...
{6928}{6967}Good day. David, come along.|Good day, sir.
{6981}{6994}But can you|tell me,
{7000}{7042}is it really|your intention to eventually explore
{7048}{7093}deep into|the bowels of the earth?
{7099}{7156}Sir, we've been|on top of the earth long enough.
{7162}{7227}It's about time|we found out what's underneath.
{7523}{7554}Great crowd,|huh, doc?
{7560}{7618}Concentrate,|David. Close doors.
{7713}{7748}Locks on.
{7764}{7797}All secure.
{7804}{7820}Ahh!
{7826}{7847}How are we?
{7853}{7870}Ready to go,|doc?
{7876}{7923}Oh, yes!|Yes, my dear fellow.
{7932}{7988}I'll just check|the gyroscopes.
{8073}{8099}Ahh!
{8105}{8138}Very nice.
{8153}{8217}Well, would you like|to move off, my boy?
{8228}{8257}Ready and|willing, doc.
{8263}{8311}Good luck,|and happy landings.
{8363}{8371}Oh, dear.
{8377}{8435}Where is that smoke|coming from?
{8441}{8494}Ah, yes. Well, you'd|better put that out
{8500}{8542}until we're|underway.
{8548}{8593}Procedure check.
{8646}{8682}Vision ports.
{8694}{8743}Opening vision|ports.
{8935}{8964}Control.
{8975}{8996}Begin lift,
{9002}{9049}steady up|to 10 degrees.
{9071}{9132}Check the|inclinometer as we go, David.
{9230}{9264}Milford,|get the horses ready,
{9270}{9309}otherwise I|shall lose 50 guineas.
{9315}{9333}No cheating,|Archie.
{9339}{9386}You can't|start until they're off.
{9546}{9610}15...|right. Hold at that and lock off.
{9616}{9672}Locked off.|Thank you, control.
{9689}{9743}Vision lights,|aft.
{9776}{9828}Vision lights,|forward.
{9853}{9887}Nose-cutters.
{10017}{10033}Right!
{10039}{10088}Bring in the|crawler banks.
{10214}{10271}Firing engines,|now.
{10390}{10412}Here we go.
{10645}{10675}Release.
{10789}{10829}Up a little|on the throttles, David.
{10853}{10894}I have her at 1800.
{10979}{11004}Oh! Back up,|David!
{11098}{11135}Going in again.
{11273}{11290}Gripping now.
{11296}{11328}Cut in|the tail pan.
{11334}{11359}Tail pan at 300.
{11365}{11406}Come on,|girls. Off we go.
{11412}{11453}Come on,|Milford.
{11471}{11514}Steady|the throttles.
{11550}{11585}We're in.
{11685}{11705}Slow her down,|David.
{11711}{11776}On the throttles.|Don't cut the engines.
{11847}{11855}Whew!
{11861}{11899}By gad!|That cannot be possible.
{11905}{11961}Quick. What does|the distance meter read?
{11974}{12009}Confounded|contraption!
{12015}{12045}It should be|700 feet deep
{12051}{12108}by the time we get|it back to horizontal.
{12204}{12245}She's going|too fast.
{12317}{12348}I can't change|her course,
{12354}{12408}most extraordinary|thing!
{12453}{12504}The mole is burning|up inside, doc.
{12596}{12665}Can you... can you just|take over, David?
{12684}{12733}I-I must...
{12739}{12797}don't give up, sir|I can't, I...
{12814}{12839}ah, oh, ah...
{12845}{12894}Doc! Doc Perry!
{12916}{12965}Ohh!|Don't...
{14130}{14179}Perry! Doc?
{14256}{14307}Oh, Doc!|Huh?
{14333}{14344}Doc!|Oh!
{14350}{14401}You all right?|Where wh-where was I?
{14476}{14509}It's c-c-c-old.
{14538}{14578}The temperature...|hmmm?
{14592}{14625}Look at it.
{14635}{14675}I can't see|a thing.
{14681}{14707}Oh!
{14713}{14727}Ice.
{14733}{14785}Ice. It can't|be possible.
{14795}{14860}Fascinating. Just|make a note of the...
{14880}{14885}oh!
{14891}{14950}Just make a note of|the temperature, will you?
{15016}{15054}She's going up!
{15075}{15119}A little more|throttle, David.
{15340}{15367}Temperature's|rising, doc.
{15373}{15403}We're on our|way home.
{15442}{15454}Not quite.
{15460}{15501}We appear to be, uh,|in the middle
{15507}{15568}of a... an underground|lake at the moment.
{15675}{15690}Ohh!
{15696}{15712}Excellent!
{15718}{15732}Excellent!
{15738}{15793}Lifting nicely.|Knew she'd do it.
{15801}{15817}Lifting nicely?
{15823}{15869}Bom bom bom|bom bom de de bom
{15875}{15934}bom bom bom|bom bom de de bom
{15977}{16009}Hold on, doc!
{16173}{16207}Hold on.
{16333}{16367}Ohh!
{16719}{16770}Total|power failure?
{16776}{16821}Oh, how very|disappointing.
{16827}{16856}It must've been|the water.
{16862}{16923}I didn't allow|for that contingency.
{16943}{16967}Well, doc,
{16973}{17015}shall we see|where we are?
{17027}{17046}Yes.
{17052}{17065}Oh.
{17071}{17122}I'll, uh, just|get my umbrella.
{17133}{17190}The weather seems|so changeable.
{17239}{17276}Ah!
{17282}{17342}Ah, where did I put it|amongst all this lot?
{17357}{17392}Ah! There it is.
{17909}{17939}Doc?
{17961}{17982}Doc!
{17988}{18027}Yes... yes. What?
{18033}{18060}Come on.|Come here, quick.
{18066}{18128}I really must|check the reason
{18145}{18182}for that|power failure.
{18188}{18229}I don't like|being...
{18328}{18384}what an|unbelievable sight.
{18453}{18467}Oop!
{18473}{18508}Steady,|doc.
{18532}{18560}David!
{18566}{18573}This can't be
{18579}{18646}the other side|of the hill, surely.
{18652}{18717}Unless it's|changed dramatically.
{18849}{18882}Well,|where are we?
{18902}{18962}Look at this|Mesozoic moss.
{18979}{19018}Or is it|a cycad?
{19038}{19065}I'm not sure,|I...
{19071}{19140}I've only seen it|before in fossilized form.
{19146}{19171}I would dearly|love to
{19177}{19203}take a frond|back with me.
{19209}{19251}Great, doc.|Just great.
{19257}{19310}But where on|earth can we be?
{19358}{19376}Doc?
{19382}{19400}Oh, I say.
{19406}{19445}Steady, they|may be stingers.
{19451}{19505}Onward,|dear boy.
{19647}{19708}What an|extraordinary sky.
{19745}{19795}What a strange|color, doc.
{19804}{19868}This cannot be|the Rhondda valley.
{19895}{19951}I've never seen|anything like it.
{19957}{20002}Like nothing|on earth.
{20210}{20253}David?
{20259}{20304}We are not|on earth.
{20310}{20324}We're not...
{20330}{20357}well, if we're|not on earth, doc,
{20363}{20381}then where|the hell are we?
{20387}{20434}From my|observations, dear friend,
{20440}{20519}I can positively|state that we are under it.
{20555}{20567}Under?
{20573}{20627}At the|earth's core.
{20797}{20839}By Jove!
{20850}{20894}How very|interesting.
{20958}{20984}Uh, d-doc...
{20990}{20996}mmm?
{21002}{21024}I-I don't|think you
{21030}{21071}want to get too|close to that.
{21173}{21178}Yes.
{21184}{21258}It is a somewhat|aggressive looking... creature.
{21652}{21690}David!
{21696}{21727}Oh, dear!
{21772}{21810}David,|don't lose contact.
{21841}{21879}Doc!
{21970}{22013}Shoo! Shoo!
{22082}{22114}Oh!
{22269}{22300}Oh!
{22436}{22467}Oh, oh dear!
{22526}{22557}Oh!
{22631}{22666}Ohh!|No, doc. This way.
{22687}{22722}Oh, dear.|Oh!
{22765}{22801}Here.|Oh, dear.
{22824}{22876}Take care of|yourself, David.
{22896}{22930}Oh!|Hang on, doc.
{23469}{23504}David?
{23520}{23558}Hang on, doc.
{23625}{23655}Oh!
{23748}{23778}Ugh!
{23930}{23962}Take that!
{24266}{24294}Come on!
{24350}{24382}You ugly...
{25633}{25665}Oh, dear.
{25671}{25696}Oh, oh, I say!
{25793}{25835}I say,|do be careful.
{26298}{26343}But we came|in peace!
{26546}{26576}Ugh!
{26661}{26691}Oh, oh, David,
{26697}{26751}how good|to see that you're safe.
{26757}{26768}Ohh!
{26774}{26834}Did you ever see anything like this before?
{26843}{26850}No.
{26856}{26891}Those prisoners|look human.
{26897}{26907}Yes.
{26913}{26925}And they|appear to be
{26931}{26975}intellectually|superior to our captors.
{26981}{27014}I do find|that interesting.
{27020}{27072}They seem a pretty|subhuman species,
{27078}{27099}yet the|master race.
{27105}{27128}Isn't that|always the way?
{27134}{27186}Yes, the power|of aggression, dear boy.
{27192}{27227}Brawn|before brains.
{27233}{27252}No! Don't|hit him!
{27258}{27330}I'll remember him, doc,|but they all look the same.
{27336}{27380}Yes.
{28367}{28405}Ugh!
{28788}{28800}David,
{28806}{28857}don't you think|it's about time we introduced
{28863}{28925}ourselves to|our fellow sufferers?
{28931}{29000}Dr. Abner Perry|at your service, ma'am.
{29059}{29102}David.
{29108}{29124}Dia.
{29130}{29174}Dia?
{29204}{29246}You can|call him Doc.
{29280}{29322}Ghak.|Oh, Ghak.
{29417}{29444}Oh!
{29450}{29476}Dia?
{29482}{29513}Who's that man|up in front
{29519}{29552}who keeps|looking at me?
{29558}{29602}He is Hoojah|the sly one.
{29608}{29654}Do not|trust him.
{30470}{30499}Perry?
{30566}{30616}Doesn't it ever|get dark here?
{30632}{30649}According|to my watch,
{30655}{30695}we've been|traveling for 2 days.
{30701}{30745}No, here there|can be no night.
{30751}{30801}Just perpetual|daylight.
{30807}{30852}We are in a cave,|you understand,
{30873}{30897}a gigantic cave.
{30903}{30942}And the sky|is the underside
{30948}{30981}of the earth's crust...
{30987}{30993}the magma,
{30999}{31079}probably something|like 20 miles above us.
{31112}{31145}Oh.
{31268}{31308}Conserve|your energy, dear boy.
{31314}{31346}We're both|going to need it.
{31352}{31391}That was my|father's watch.
{31397}{31436}Unpleasant|character.
{31442}{31491}Oh, dear!
{31510}{31560}Dia?
{31569}{31608}Who are they?
{31670}{31683}Sagoths,
{31689}{31727}soldiers of|the Mahars.
{31733}{31778}Oh, and... and|pardon me,
{31784}{31824}what are|Mahars?
{31830}{31863}Mahars rule|Pellucidar,
{31869}{31927}and Sagoths take us|to be slaves in their city.
{31933}{31981}What a charming prospect.Dia.
{32056}{32101}Aghh!
{32117}{32155}Agh!
{32607}{32650}Dia!
{32693}{32715}Your act|of chivalry
{32721}{32772}didn't seem very|popular, David.
{33024}{33073}Ahhh!
{35652}{35686}Pardon me.
{35721}{35770}Doc!
{36061}{36067}David!
{36073}{36137}That must be|the city of the Mahars.
{36276}{36321}Oh! Do watch|that thing!
{36335}{36376}Ohh!
{36390}{36428}Uhh!
{36451}{36486}Oh, they're|so excitable,
{36492}{36527}like all|foreigners.
{36533}{36548}Dia.
{36554}{36600}Dia!
{36606}{36636}I just wanted|to ask her
{36642}{36666}how much|farther.
{36672}{36724}They're giving|us the cold shoulder, David.
{36730}{36758}We certainly|seem to have
{36764}{36808}blotted our|copybook somehow.
{36814}{36856}Ohh!
{37075}{37120}Ugh!
{37416}{37428}David,|I-I...
{37434}{37477}I'm sorry to|be a burden, but I...
{37483}{37534}I don't think|I can go on much longer.
{37540}{37550}Come on,|doc.
{37556}{37623}It can't be|much farther.
{37846}{37884}Oh!
{38582}{38634}Noisy lot, aren't they, David?
{38732}{38774}Ah.
{39018}{39042}Doc?
{39048}{39066}Mmm?
{39072}{39109}Dia...
{39115}{39131}Dia,|she's gone.
{39137}{39156}Uh?|She's not here?
{39162}{39189}Ghak,
{39198}{39269}what happened|to Dia?
{39302}{39349}Hoojah|the sly one.
{39355}{39409}He escaped|with the girl you refused.
{39416}{39468}I what?|You insulted Dia.
{39474}{39533}Do you not|know what you have done?
{39545}{39552}No.
{39558}{39597}When a man from|Pellucidar fights
{39603}{39639}with another man|for a woman,
{39645}{39700}she belongs|to he who wins.
{39714}{39757}Well, you should've|claimed her
{39763}{39784}or released her.
{39790}{39821}But you showed|contempt
{39827}{39873}for her by|doing nothing.
{39890}{39952}Now no man can|take her as mate
{39977}{40039}until he's overcome|you in combat.
{40126}{40141}I didn't know.
{40147}{40213}I-I thought I was|protecting her.
{40242}{40272}Forgive me,
{40284}{40334}for you could|not have known.
{40399}{40436}Dia was in hiding
{40449}{40483}from Jubal,
{40507}{40542}the ugly one.
{40579}{40596}He is a man with
{40602}{40661}the strength|of many men.
{40679}{40713}And he has made|it known that
{40719}{40775}he wants Dia|for his mate.
{40818}{40833}There is no one
{40839}{40873}who can defend|her against him,
{40879}{40929}and so Dia|fled to the hills.
{40965}{41039}Only to be captured|by a Sagoth raiding party.
{41161}{41233}There is something|you should know, my friend.
{41264}{41302}Dia is a princess,
{41347}{41384}the daughter|of kings.
{41448}{41476}She is proud
{41482}{41516}and she will|never forgive you,
{41522}{41564}even if you did|find her again,
{41570}{41623}which you will not.
{41644}{41701}We are all doomed|to slavery...
{41750}{41784}and death.
{42060}{42131}They are no respecters of age, are they?
{42412}{42421}David!
{42427}{42478}What a|phenomenal sight...
{42502}{42540}a fire|curtain!
{42572}{42621}Ooh!
{43935}{43990}Ugh!
{44734}{44771}David!|What?
{44777}{44807}A Rhamphorhynchus
{44813}{44862}of the middle|Jurassic period.
{45178}{45212}My goodness,|how enormous.
{45218}{45282}Why, the largest|remains we ever discovered
{45288}{45335}have never|indicated a size much greater
{45341}{45395}than that|attained by an ordinary crow.
{47590}{47607}Oh!|Hey!
{47613}{47647}What are|you doing?
{47653}{47671}Oh, oh!
{47677}{47710}Doc!
{48338}{48359}Oh!
{48365}{48374}Perry!
{48380}{48409}Take care|of yourself.
{48415}{48435}I will, and you.
{48441}{48496}You are beginning|to annoy me.
{49455}{49503}Ghak,|one at a time.
{49509}{49559}You've got|a long day.
{49740}{49759}Ahh!
{49765}{49813}Ah, there|you are, my friend.
{49819}{49872}Another one|for the shelves.
{49894}{49929}Thank you.
{49956}{50002}Now, what|have we got?
{50065}{50098}Hmm.
{50104}{50138}Fascinating.
{50171}{50215}"The Mahar...
{50221}{50258}"is limited...
{50264}{50311}"vocally...
{50369}{50418}"but has been...
{50453}{50498}"endowed...
{50504}{50524}"with...
{50530}{50562}"mesmeric powers...
{50568}{50627}"and a high degree|of telepathy."
{50645}{50661}Hmm.
{50667}{50707}That's quite|a combination,
{50713}{50761}for a bird.
{50912}{50945}I don't know|what it is
{50951}{50990}they're giving|us to eat.
{50996}{51047}Perhaps it's|just as well.
{51114}{51161}Doc?|Mm-hmm?
{51167}{51223}How do we|get out of here?
{51236}{51259}I really|haven't been
{51265}{51285}able to find|out anything
{51291}{51351}definite about the|Mahar's secret yet,
{51358}{51395}except that,
{51406}{51422}in some way,
{51428}{51474}it is connected|with the lava,
{51487}{51520}with the heat.
{51526}{51551}Well, I'm|certainly getting
{51557}{51575}to know|about that.
{51581}{51626}Ahh, but|that is the point, David.
{51632}{51649}Slaves are|used
{51655}{51681}to constantly|repair
{51687}{51729}and divert|the lava channels.
{51735}{51768}You see,|although the lava
{51774}{51792}is of vital|importance,
{51798}{51843}it is also|eating away at the very
{51849}{51895}foundations|of the Mahar city.
{51901}{51938}And so its|flow has to be
{51944}{51996}continually|checked and rechanneled.
{52002}{52055}In fact,|the whole safety of the city
{52061}{52113}is dependant|upon the slaves.
{52120}{52134}And, uh,|we are
{52140}{52190}among their|number now.
{52196}{52238}Oh, there's|cheerful Annie again.
{52244}{52309}Watch yourself,|doc.
{52339}{52370}Doc!
{61178}{61229}Yeah.
{61945}{61987}David.
{61993}{62020}D-David.
{62026}{62058}Ra.|Ra?
{62074}{62106}Hu-rrah.
{62247}{62284}Oh, uh...
{62304}{62358}I don't come|from Pellucidar.
{62368}{62411}I come from|another world.
{62508}{62532}I escaped
{62538}{62568}from the|Mahar city.
{62574}{62643}No one can escape|from the Mahar city.
{62668}{62693}The Mahars
{62699}{62737}are all-seeing,
{62743}{62794}all lethal.
{62810}{62818}Ra,
{62824}{62854}why haven't|you risen up
{62860}{62881}and fought|the Mahars?
{62887}{62935}You do not know|the Mahar.
{62944}{62957}You have not
{62963}{63001}really seen|their
{63007}{63044}power.
{63050}{63087}They're evil!
{63093}{63133}Hmm.
{63165}{63180}Ra,
{63186}{63252}if your tribe|and the others
{63258}{63287}joined together,
{63293}{63339}you could|defeat the Mahars.
{63345}{63390}It's good|thought.
{63418}{63455}But come|with me.
{63469}{63505}I'll show you.
{63520}{63559}Then you'll|understand.
{63807}{63845}Ra?
{63852}{63899}Where are you|taking me?
{64133}{64175}We are now|within the outer walls
{64181}{64212}of the|Mahar grotto.
{64218}{64262}We climb.
{64865}{64903}Ugh!
{65957}{66004}What are these|prisoners doing here?
{66011}{66058}Wait, and you|shall see.
{66078}{66114}You may be|thankful that you're not
{66120}{66184}on the same|side of the wall as they.
{66200}{66240}The Mahars.
{66459}{66502}Are you looking|for someone?
{66516}{66550}Yes.
{66556}{66594}Dia.
{67005}{67056}Thank god|she's not here.
{68603}{68637}Vile cr...
{69590}{69633}They've got|to be destroyed.
{69743}{69778}They've got|to be.
{69784}{69807}Come.
{69813}{69851}We go.
{73780}{73832}David.
{74308}{74330}I'm going back.
{74336}{74383}After what you've|just seen?
{74398}{74452}Especially after|what I've seen.
{74458}{74499}They've got|to be destroyed.
{74509}{74542}David,
{74548}{74600}you're|one man...
{74606}{74651}strong,|it's true.
{74710}{74751}How can|you win?
{74757}{74770}I've got to find
{74776}{74808}the secret|of the Mahars
{74814}{74853}and destroy|them.
{74939}{74970}I'll bring|Ghak back.
{74976}{75021}Ghak?
{75027}{75076}He will not|trust me.
{75082}{75130}No tribe trusts|each other.
{75223}{75267}I know.
{75446}{75515}You go back to|your village, Ra,
{75528}{75572}till the Sagoths|come again.
{75701}{75731}Do you think|I'll let
{75737}{75804}you go back alone?
{75871}{75918}You're a|friend, Ra.
{75924}{75951}Yes,
{75957}{76003}but foolish friend.
{76009}{76070}The Mahars will|make a meal of us.
{76097}{76156}We've just doubled|our strength.
{77336}{77389}It's...
{79972}{80009}David!
{80015}{80037}The ear.
{80043}{80092}Get it behind|the ear.
{80474}{80524}Ahh!
{80710}{80747}The ear!
{82528}{82568}Oh, no!
{83671}{83706}You got him!
{84235}{84280}Bravo!
{84314}{84349}David, above you!
{85240}{85275}Freedom!
{85406}{85442}Freedom!
{85504}{85538}Freedom! Freedom!
{85982}{86020}Come on, doc.
{86209}{86240}Get a tight hold,|doc.
{86246}{86266}I have a|firm grip
{86272}{86304}upon your|trousers, David.
{86310}{86323}David!|What?
{86329}{86367}I found it!|I found the Mahar secret!
{86373}{86401}Come with me.|Not now, doc!
{86407}{86452}But it's just through|this hidey-hole.
{86458}{86524}Come on, me boy,|I'll show you.
{87047}{87093}It's not far|now, David.
{87099}{87146}Be careful|of the edge.
{87399}{87466}It was the|most amazing piece of luck.
{87472}{87514}I practically|stumbled on it.
{87520}{87560}And after pondering|over all those
{87566}{87595}heavy slabs|in the library
{87601}{87648}and learning very|little from them,
{87654}{87703}I got so|dispirited.
{87713}{87723}I kept thinking,
{87729}{87763}"whatever will|I tell David
{87769}{87784}"when he|gets back?"
{87790}{87852}You knew I'd come|back for you, did you?
{87866}{87885}Of course I did.
{87891}{87963}What would I|do without you?
{88065}{88088}There...
{88094}{88132}there it is.
{88138}{88157}The very origin
{88163}{88226}of every Mahar|that's born.
{88232}{88264}Look, David.
{88270}{88315}Do you see|that winch?
{88321}{88350}That is what|controls
{88356}{88412}the fire curtain.
{88564}{88571}This is where
{88577}{88638}we're going|to finish them.
{89265}{89293}It's a|dead end, David.
{89299}{89324}Doc,|in here.
{89330}{89340}Down there?
{89346}{89376}But I'm not|a rabbit, you know.
{89382}{89413}Come on,|doc.
{89566}{89625}Fascinating|rock structure, David.
{89632}{89691}Would you|please, doc... come on!
{89706}{89713}Oh.
{89719}{89771}Oh, I I'll|just sit for a moment.
{89790}{89832}Alright.|Catch your breath.
{89852}{89900}I can't find|my marks.
{89906}{89913}David?
{89919}{89988}Have you ever|thought of going to the moon?
{90014}{90043}Hmm?
{90049}{90064}Come on,|doc.
{90070}{90125}Oh, uh,|wh-which way now?
{90187}{90230}I'm afraid we're lost, doc.
{90248}{90254}Be careful
{90260}{90298}not to graze|yourself on these
{90304}{90363}formidable-looking|rocks here.
{90404}{90437}Oh!
{90443}{90469}I say,
{90475}{90493}there's that...
{90499}{90560}peculiar pellucid|light ahead.
{90566}{90610}Shall we explore?
{90702}{90735}Whoops-a-daisy.
{90741}{90796}Here, doc.|Come on.
{90802}{90841}Watch|yourself.
{90847}{90903}Come on.
{91043}{91088}Oh!
{91094}{91140}Fresh air|at last.
{91206}{91226}David?
{91270}{91313}I'm so sorry,|dear fellow.
{91319}{91337}This place is apt
{91343}{91379}to make one|a little jumpy.
{91385}{91429}Here, sit down.
{91749}{91769}Dia!
{91775}{91824}Come, and I|kill her.
{91989}{92008}Dia!
{92014}{92050}Ahh! David!
{93196}{93228}Bull's-eye!
{93334}{93362}Dia?
{93368}{93377}No.
{93383}{93441}Dia, I thought|I'd never see you again.
{93457}{93507}Dia?
{93558}{93599}Be masterful,|David.
{93626}{93656}Dia?
{93662}{93688}Sit down!
{93694}{93724}Sit down!
{93730}{93756}Now, you listen|to me...
{93762}{93803}no, it's|too late now.
{93838}{93874}When we were|near my village,
{93880}{93897}I managed to escape
{93903}{93919}from Hoojah|the sly one.
{93925}{93966}And now I fear|that Hoojah the sly one
{93972}{94023}will lead Jubal|the ugly one back here.
{94029}{94062}I heard|about him.
{94068}{94095}David, he will|kill you.
{94101}{94134}He is the|strongest warrior
{94140}{94196}in all of|Pellucidar.
{94248}{94294}What, David?
{94429}{94453}The sooner|I meet up
{94459}{94491}with Jubal,|the better.
{94497}{94531}Come on.
{94537}{94556}Come on!
{94562}{94604}Watch your step, doc.
{94613}{94631}Oh, yes.
{94637}{94656}My word,
{94662}{94704}what a fiery|beastie.
{94770}{94801}Oh, your royal|highness,
{94807}{94867}how very nice|to see you again.
{94873}{94898}Remarkably|efficient,
{94904}{94943}these primitive|weapons.
{94949}{94971}I've never had|occasion
{94977}{94991}to use them|before.
{94997}{95053}Ha! The cord|from my spectacles.
{95089}{95106}Oh, y-your|tomahawk
{95112}{95178}came in very useful,|too, David.
{95184}{95235}Brains|before brawn, huh, doc?
{95243}{95266}Oh, a|combination
{95272}{95296}of both,|dear boy.
{95302}{95326}We must|hurry.
{95332}{95401}Yeah, I've|got to find the ugly one.
{95407}{95433}Wouldn't|exactly call
{95439}{95483}him very pretty,|would you?
{95489}{95557}Hey, David!|Wait for me!
{95615}{95638}It's Jubal
{95644}{95686}the ugly one!
{95746}{95772}You can say|that again.
{95778}{95799}Come,|we must hide.
{95805}{95864}No, no, Dia, no!|Come!
{95874}{95901}I'm gonna|have to fight
{95907}{95932}Jubal once|and for all.
{95938}{95964}Stand aside,|David.
{95970}{96029}Doc, I said|this is my fight.
{97438}{97493}Ohh!|David!
{97518}{97575}David...
{97858}{97910}Watch him,|David!
{98436}{98463}That's right,|David.
{98469}{98508}Dia.
{98552}{98582}No! No!
{98588}{98630}Unhand her,|you coward.
{98760}{98798}Aha!
{98840}{98903}Never mind|the Queensberry rules.
{99694}{99750}Well done,|David!
{99829}{99849}Now...
{99855}{99895}you scoundrel.
{100006}{100037}Missed.
{100043}{100066}Well,|at least we
{100072}{100101}put him to his|heels. Hmph!
{100107}{100138}Well done, David!
{100144}{100180}Such courage,|my boy!
{100186}{100241}Such great|courage!
{100247}{100297}David!
{100388}{100426}Jubal!
{100432}{100480}You have|defeated Jubal.
{100529}{100575}Dia is yours.
{100589}{100632}Dia will not|be mine
{100642}{100693}until we destroy|the Mahars
{100699}{100756}and free|Pellucidar.
{101111}{101146}Raise bows.
{101196}{101228}Take aim.
{101260}{101289}Fire!
{101344}{101371}Robin Hood|and his
{101377}{101436}merry men,|what, David?
{101649}{101677}Hear me,
{101683}{101746}leaders of the tribes|of Pellucidar.
{101769}{101803}These strangers
{101809}{101847}came to our world...
{101853}{101904}a world ruled|by the Mahars
{101910}{101939}who have enslaved
{101945}{101995}and tortured us.
{102001}{102059}For as long as|we can recall...
{102065}{102132}our tribes|have been divided.
{102145}{102180}Now,
{102186}{102210}with the help
{102216}{102266}of our new-found|friends
{102272}{102294}we are united.
{102300}{102329}And we have|the strength
{102335}{102350}and the power
{102356}{102406}to destroy once|and for all
{102412}{102474}those who have|enslaved us.
{102493}{102510}Death
{102516}{102569}to the Mahars!
{102988}{103012}Well, David,|would you like
{103018}{103077}to summarize|our deployment?
{103126}{103183}I will lead|the main attack.
{103191}{103217}Ghak,|and his men
{103223}{103267}will cover|the rear.
{103273}{103308}Ra and|Dr. Perry
{103314}{103369}will go ahead|of us
{103375}{103407}through the|lava channel
{103413}{103455}to the inner|sanctum
{103461}{103476}and cut off
{103482}{103521}the main fire|supply.
{103527}{103561}I hate to ask you|to do this, doc,
{103567}{103619}but you know where|the controls are.
{103625}{103643}I'm delighted|to be
{103649}{103693}of some active|service, my boy.
{103699}{103728}Don't you|worry, David.
{103734}{103785}I will take|good care of him.
{103791}{103833}Oh, most|kind.
{103839}{103855}Well,
{103861}{103917}meeting|adjourned, gentlemen.
{103974}{104005}I go with|you, yes?
{104011}{104051}No, Dia.|No.
{104057}{104109}Why not,|David?
{104134}{104146}Dia,
{104152}{104195}the Mahar city is|no place for you.
{104295}{104350}David...|Dia.
{105879}{105894}Ah!
{105900}{105954}This|is it.
{105992}{106018}I must|warn you,
{106024}{106086}it gets very|hot in there.
{107149}{107209}Deuced hot!
{107548}{107606}You could roast|an ox in here.
{108147}{108161}Got you,|you bounder!
{108219}{108246}Oh, I do beg|your pardon,
{108252}{108273}your royal|highness.
{108279}{108335}I-I thought you|were the enemy.
{108341}{108355}No.|Dia,
{108361}{108398}what are you|doing here?
{108404}{108415}It's Hoojah...
{108421}{108471}he has been captured|by the Sagoths.
{108509}{108540}He might|betray us.
{108546}{108578}The traitorous|blighter!
{108584}{108625}What a pity my|arrow missed him.
{108631}{108672}Oh, well.|Quickly, fall in.
{108678}{108703}Follow me. Right.
{108709}{108768}Single file.
{109401}{109436}Retreat!
{109578}{109640}Ra, the|inner sanctum!
{115969}{116018}You cannot|mesmerize me!
{116024}{116099}I'm British!
{116824}{116838}Dia!
{116844}{116875}Dia! Perry!
{117251}{117293}Dia!
{118805}{118848}Dia!
{118905}{118949}Doc!
{119330}{119378}Dia!

{120537}{120586}David!
{120798}{120847}Ahh, David!
{121013}{121060}David!
{121126}{121161}Doc,|you're limping!

{122212}{122240}Come on!
{122246}{122294}Keep going,|doc.
{122402}{122428}Dia.
{122434}{122489}Perry, this way.
{122755}{122797}Wh-why have you stopped?
{122803}{122847}We must|wait for Ra!
{122853}{122879}Oh, yes!
{122885}{122919}Ra!
{122925}{122985}Ra!|It's too late.

{124816}{124878}Come on, doc.
{125127}{125147}Ah, here's David
{125153}{125204}and his|lovely lady.
{125210}{125266}Good-bye!
{125339}{125393}People of|Pellucidar,
{125404}{125469}according to|your custom,
{125506}{125542}I take
{125548}{125600}Dia
{125617}{125671}to be my bride.
{125813}{125851}No, David.
{125857}{125916}It's not to be.
{125994}{126026}I must stay here.
{126032}{126077}This is my world.
{126092}{126154}I would be lost|in yours.
{126160}{126167}No.
{126173}{126206}No, you wouldn't.|I want to show you
{126212}{126264}the wonders|of my world.
{126270}{126311}I know,
{126317}{126378}and I love you.
{126516}{126542}Come along,|David.

{126653}{126706}Good-bye,|Dia.
{126782}{126839}God bless you.
{128185}{128236}David?
You did it! You did it!
Come here!
You just hit it big time!
You just won the Big Bundle!
And what a bundle it is, Ron!
Do you realize you just won $50,000?
There you are.
Yeah, that's only the beginning.
The Really Big Bundle is that you're going to have a week at the most fabulous resort in the world.
You're going to Delos, Ron!
- Delos!
- That's right, Delos.
Where you may choose Roman World, a lusty treat for the senses, where beautiful robot women are yours to command and robot gladiators die at the point of your sword.
Or Medieval World, an exact reconstruction of 13th century Europe, where you may live like an absolute king.
Or Spa World, a garden of pleasure, where old age and pain have been eliminated.
Or Futureworld, where you will be transported throughout the solar system, commanding you very own rocket ship, enjoying the favors of robot women of weightless beauty, soaring through space like an astronaut.
All that and more is yours, Ron.
Congratulations.
You keep following me?
Bye, Mac.
Hello, Shorty.
How many points you gonna give on the Colts?
- Seven.
- Seven?
I got 50 says you're wrong.
Ain't never gonna get rich being stupid.
Just say I got a hunch.
- I read your column today.
- Yeah, what'd you think?
It's gonna wrap a lot of garbage.
Yeah, quack, quack, quack.
Hey, you behind on your bills?
Good morning to you too.
Some guy's been calling for you every five minutes for the last two hours.
Driving me nuts!
- Get a number?
- Nope.
City desk, Browning.
Is this Chuck Browning?
That's right.
Look, you wrote a story a couple of years ago about the trouble at Westworld.
You're the same guy, right?
You bet.
I got a story for you, maybe a big one.
All right, tell me.
You crazy? I ain't giving it away.
I'm in trouble. I need some money.
- Okay, how much?
- I don't know.
All I want is for you to meet me somewhere.
I'll tell you what I got, you pay me what it's worth.
All right, what's your name?
Frenchy. Frenchy DuPorte.
Mee tme in ten mimutes at the
Hyatt Regency crossover, Frenchy.
What do you look like?
I seen your picture.
I'll find you.
Anything?
It's my day for long shots.
Frenchy?
What's the matter?
Frenchy, what happened?
Delos.
What?
Delos.
- You're late.
- You're right.
Two years ago, the worst day in the history of Delos began with no obvious signs that anything would go wrong.
The robots were behaving as programmed.
And although there was some evidence of circuit malfunction, it was well within the normal parameters.
Mr. Dyffy, are you saying that despite your sophisticated sensors,
- What the hell are you doing here?
- you had absolutely no indication about it?
- Later.
- None at all.
Then quite suddenly, one of our most complicated robot gunslingers began to act in a most vicious manner.
For the first time in our history, a robot actually killed a guest.
Within a few moments
Delos was in turmoil.
I thought your only problem was in Westworld?
No, thanks to your Mr. Browning,
Westworld got the brunt of the bad publicity, but the breakdown occured throughout the resort.
Mr. Duffy, I don't quite understand why you didn't shut off the power supply to your robots.
We did.
But they ran on reserve long enough to do a great deal of damage.
- How many guests were killed?
- More than 50.
And of course, many of our own technicians also died.
In fact, by the time we regained control,
95 members of our technical and maintenance staff had either been killed or wounded.
Aside from the human loss,
It was a financial and public relations disaster of the first magnitude.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, those of us who have devoted our lives to creating Delos, were stunned by the events I've just shown you.
Yet, we did not lose faith.
Now, for the last two years, we have invested more than 1.5 billion dollars to rebuild our equipement.
We have replaced every circuit, every program, every robot.
The new Delos is not only the most fantastic resort in human history, it is also fail-safe.
Now, last month, as you know, we re-opened the resort.
Public response has been good, but, quite frankly, not as good as it should be.
Our problem is the memory of a disaster at Westworld.
And that's why we've come to you.
We offer the IMC Network an absolute exclusive story for all media.
Every phase of our operation will be open to you.
And all we ask in return is that you treat us in a fair and positive manner.
Arthur.
Arthur, you mustn't do this to me.
Not for one damn minute, do you hear me?
They can hear you in the lobby, honey.
I'm not talking to you, mister!
Listen, you promised me that the Delos story would be mine.
Exclusive to television and exclusive to me, is that right?
- Yes.
- Then will you tell me why this ink-stained Neanderthal was invited to our meeting?
He has an angle. I want to pursue it.
Well, let's call it a hunch.
Oh, wonderful.
And when the people at Delos find out that you have sent Mr. Bad News himself, that's the end of our exclusive.
I told Mr. Duffy what I had in mind.
He has no objection.
- Well, I do!
- Yes, I gathered as much.
But I would like to remind you that while you are indeed a glamorous and highly paid television correspondent, you're still an employee.
In fact, you're my employee.
And unless you would like to spend the next five years doing weather and fashion in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, you will now shut up and do as you're told.
Oh, yes?
Yes, Arthur?
We'll see about that.
Excuse me.
Socks, come on, lighten up.
Oh, what do you want?
Well, I just want to tell you I like your style.
You had old Holcombe there swallowing his corporate stripes.
You mean you're sorry you fired me?
That was 'cause you weren't a very good reporter.
Listen, I was a kid out of college who happened to think that newspapers ought to be more than dirt and bad news.
That sounds like a line from an old movie.
You know, you'd think that even so dumb a brain as yours would finally get the message.
I happen to have 55 million viewers worldwide.
You've got a couple thousand old crones in the public library.
Why don't you wise up, mister?
Nobody reads.
Well, then you've got nothing to worry about.
Now, come on, let's have a truce.
I don't trust you.
Well, you like me a little, don't you?
Anyway, we've got a week to spend together alone, so what the hell?
I don't like being called Socks.
Well, I can't help that.
The first time that I was with you, you had those outrageous red socks on.
Took me a week to get over that.
Yeah, and then you fired me.
Well, now listen, that was business.
Now, come on, what do you say?
Truce, huh?
I'll think about it.
General Karnovski regrets, but he does not give interviews now.
He's on vacation.
Well, listen the right interview in an important American paper could be good for the General.
Maybe get him a promotion.
The General does not need a promotion.
You've got a point.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
You mean to tell me that you've never heared of me?
I mean, really.
I mean, come on, you look at me.
You're putting me on with those beautiful green eyes.
Honey, I won, the Big Bundle!
The TV contest!
You must've heard of that!
A montage of international types.
I think that would be a good idea.
Well, well, how do you do?
- Terrible.
- Why?
I tried the Iranian oil ministers, nothing.
Karnovski said nyet.
That leaves Takaguchi.
My last shot over there.
What is it that you're after, anyway?
I don't know, this Delos guset list looks like a rerun from the last
Geneva Conference.
Oil ministers, rocket experts, heavyweight electronic types.
For God sakes, at $1,200 a day, who else could afford this?
You know, you are looking for something that isn't there.
You may be right.
Hey, Miss Ballard.
Miss Ballard, now, listen now, you have got to put me on your show.
No fooling now, I am a real angle.
Oh, excuse me, pal.
Oh, that's all right. Listen, why don't you take that seat there?
- Oh, thanks, thanks.
- You bet.
- What's your name?
- Ron Thurlow, Ron.
The Big Bundle, you know?
- Ron, I'm Chuck Browning.
- Hi.
Ron, you don't read, do you?
Me, no, I'm a tube freak.
Right, well, you just sit right there,
'cause I know Miss Ballard loves to get close to her viewers.
- Oh, thanks.
- You bet.
- Yeah.
- Ciao.
- Thanks, pal.
- Anytime.
Nice felllow. Now, listen, here's the deal, Miss Ballard.
You see, now, I am a common type man, but you see, right now, well, I'm a big winner.
Now, that's news, right?
Yes, that's right, Ron, but let me tell you something.
You see, the video crew isn't here on this trip.
This is just a research trip, you see.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Doggone that's too bad.
- Sorry.
Hey, do you know what this fella told me?
He told me, "Once you make it with a robot chick,
"that's it, you don't never want nothing else."
I swear to God, that's what he told me.
Are you going to do it?
Do what, Ron?
Have sex with a robot?
Not this trip, Ron.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Salahari International Airport.
Delos passangers may proceed directly to the resort.

Oh, yes, sir, they come in all shapes and sizes.
Whatever you desire.
Honey, you are perfect.
Oh, no sir, I'm a 500.
I'm not programmed for sex.
- Futureworld, huh?
- Mmm.
Well, Duffy wasn't lying about one thing.
What's that?
This place is three time larger than the old one.
- Is it?
- You bet, and how.
Well, it's all set, a day or two in Futureworld, and you can come back stage with me and see the hard work behind the magic.
Of course, at any time, you're free to go where you wish.
No restrictions?
Well, for your own safety, we can't have you wandering off just anywhere.
But whatever you want to see, we'll be glad to show you.
Well, that's a hell of a lot better than the last time I was here.
Well, we have blast off scheduled in half an hour.
And you, Miss Ballard, are the commander of the flight.
I am?
Medieval World guests are reminded
that no cameras may be taken beyond this area.
Please, leave all cameras and photographic equipment
at the costume desk.
- Mr. Takaguchi?
- Yes.
I'm very sorry, I've checked with control, and it's impossible for you to use your father's sword.
- We're very sorry.
- Quite right, I understand.
Your weapons must, of course, be very special.
I'm really very nervous.
Oh, no, there's nothing to worry about.
It's all play-like, we're not really going anywhere.
I don't think.
Ta-da.
- So, how do I look, huh?
- Not too shabby, come on.
Oh, not so bad yourself.
My name is Eric. This is Erica.
We will be ypur guides in Futureword.
Now, if you will all follow us, we will take a tram to the launch area.
Please, stay in the group.
Those selecting Futureworld
are in route to the Aries II space shuttle,
which will take you to a rendez-vous to the Voyager starship now in orbit.
Aboard the starship, you will be able to walk in space
and on the surface of the moon.
You will also see the Martian ice caps, ride an asteroid,
and experience all the thrills of deep space.
All Futureworld guests are reminded
that Futureworld is a perfectly safe environment
designed for your pleasure.
Any appearance of danger is simply a device to enhance your experience.
In Futureworld, nothing can go wrong.
...relaxed morality in beautiful Pompeii.
Please, indulge your every whim.
Whatever you wish, will be yours.
Follow me, please.
Wow, I could open the program with this.
Yep.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to board.
Please, follow me.
Step right up here.
Thank you.
Watch your steps, please.

Yes, sir.
Begin the Saxon Knight sequence on my mark.
3, 2, 1, mark.
I smell a heathen pig!
No doubt, sir, you smell yourself!
Notify Robot Center that the Saxon Knight has been terminated by Mr. Takaguchi.

My knight to your pawn.
My castle to your knight.
Man, lookie here. Hiya, hi there.
Hey, ain't this something, man?
Now, are there any other questions?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Are you sure we can't get hurt?
'Cause I got plans for tonight.
There's really nothing to worry about.
Skiing on Mars is not that different than on Earth.
Of course, the snow is red.
And gravity is one third.
But your skis are designed for that purpose.
Ladies and gentlemen,
all guests are encouraged to request the host
or hostess of their choice.
Why can't you?
Because I'm too old for you.
I'd feel like a fool.
Not at all.
You must remember that I've been programmed for your pleasure.
In my eyes, you are very beautiful.
Hey, we've got to try this thing.
Put your quarter on the table, honey.
We'll get to that one.
I'll be there in a second.
Yes, sir. May I get you something?
You have pretty good memory banks?
I'm a 500, sir.
- We have quite excellent memories.
- Good.
You ever seen that fellow before?
No, sir. Is he a guest?
I guess you'd call him inoperative.
Thanks.
Now, are you sure that they are robots?
- They're not ging to get hurt or anything, are they?
- Positive.
Just pick up the gloves, honey.
Okay.
- Ready?
- Yep.
- Chuck?
- Yeah?
I forgive you everything.
Did you see that?
Did you see that left? Pow!
Terrific.
I'm afraid I interrupted.
Bu I think now would be a good time for you to come backstage with me.
All the worlds are at full function, and you do have limited time.
- Good.
- I forgot something.
I'll be right back. Excuse me.
Bartender?
Yes, sir?
That photo I showed you earlier,
I forgot to get it back.
Oh, no, sir. I gave you the picture back.
No, you didn't.
Oh, yes, sir.
- You're a liar.
- No, sir.
I'm not programmed to lie.
Well, for a man without a program, you do a pretty damn good job!
Something wrong?
No.
No, I must've made a mistake.
Well, to err is human.
That must be it.
But it's all right. I have another one.
Your attention, please.
The first space safari to the caves of Venus
is available for sign up at the tour desk.
Mr. Duffy, you know, I wanted to ask you about those chessmen.
Are they real, or what are they?
No, they're holograms.
Optical illusions.
Everything in Futureworld is perfectly safe.
We don't use this very often, so... watch your step, huh?
It's hard to belive we never left the ground.
I was convinced that we were really in orbit.
I thought the queen stole that camera.
She did. Apparently, he stole it back.
The Takaguchi horse and lance are now programmed for combat with a plus 10 probability of victory on the first pass.
Begin the joust sequence on my mark.
3, 2, 1, mark.
Guests always win?
We try to make it believable for them, of course.
But the guests are always the victors.
Mind if we look around?
No, go right ahead.
Please, mark this robot for pick-up and repair.
Notify Robor Center that all vital signs were terminated...
You just relax and enjoy yourself.
Take this all in.
Come here a second.
- Where are we going?
- Just come here.
- I want you to do me a favor.
- What?
I want you to pick out one of these guys and turn him on.
Why would you want me to do that?
- Just trust me.
- Why should I trust you?
Just trust me for once, will you Socks?
Pick out one of these guys and do a number on him and get him interested, you know?
What is your game?
It's no game, believe me.
Oh, you do remember how to get someone interested?
Do I remember how to get someone interested?
Okay, which one?
Piece of cake.
Hey, you really know what you're doing.
I've been watching you.
I'm Tracy Ballard.
How do you do?
Hi, what's your name?
Steven.
Steven, I'm doing a video special on Delos, and, God, it's so confusing, you know?
I thought maybe later on we could get together.
You could sort of help me out.
I'm sorry, that's not possible.
Ah, you're married, huh?
No, ma'am.
Well.
Gee, this is a wonderful job, but don't you kind of get... a little lonely, Steven?
No, ma'am.
You're not making this easy, Steven.
Tell me, do you think I'm pretty?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, I'm awfully lonely here.
Steven, I... I'd like it--
I'm sorry, ma'am.
All right, begin the spacewalk sequence on my mark.
Bring the moon up a little fuller, please.
3, 2, 1, mark.
I think you better try him yourself.
I don't think he likes girls.
Yeah, then come on.
What are we trying to prove?
Just come on.
Give me a quantum 9.
- Hey, Duffy.
- You seen enough?
Enough to know that
I'm getting the fast shuffle.
What are you talking about?
Well, in my business we call it managed news.
Such as?
Such as what's wrong with all the people in this room?
I mean, are they drugged or hypnotized or what?
Because they sure as hell aren't normal.
They're normal for robots.
All these people are machines?
That's impossible!
Seems I'm to blame for not explaining.
You see, we discovered that one of the causes for our disaster with Westworld lay with the human flaws of our controllers.
So we replaced them with these.
The model 700 technician series.
They have no ego.
So, they have no hang-ups.
And thus, one more source of error is eliminated.
They're all robots.
I feel very badly.
I was sure that Dr. Schneider had told you.
Prepare the Martian ski sequence for five guests.
And return power to grid 3.
I'll tell you something, mister.
That is the last time you get me to flyspeck Delos.
And if you don't stop acting like such a paranoid idiot,
I hope Duffy throws you out of here.
Well, why didn't he tell us?
I mean, why did he wait?
He forgot.
Isn't that a perfectly normal human thing to do?
If you weren't so eager to do a hatchet job, you wouldn't think twice about it.
I thought you should see what's left of Westworld.
I don't want to be accused of trying to hide anything.
Oh, now Mr. Duffy, I hope you understand
I don't think you're trying to hide anything.
I think that Delos is wonderful and I'm sure that's how the story's going to come out.
That's very gratifying.
Gratifying, yes. Well, I'd like to have a look around by myself.
If you don't have any objections?
- Not at all.
- Hmm.
Interesting fellow.
- Certainly has a suspicious mind.
- Oh, yes.
He thinks it's admirable.
Chuck?
Chuck, where are you?
Chuck?
Chuck?
Can I give you a hand?
You brat!
I should've known better than to worry about you.
Tracy.
Damn!
I just... can't decide.
Then don't.
Take us both.
I don't think that would work out.
Why not?
We're both sex models.
Yeah, that's okay for you, but... I mean...
I mean, what the hell, I'm no Superman.
You'd be surprised.
Well, I'll leave you to yourselves.
Dinner should be along shortly.
Better get plenty of rest.
Got a big day head of us.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
Socks.
Aw, come on, Socks, it was only a joke.
My bed is upstairs, yours is downstairs.
Let's make damn sure we keep it that way.
Monitoring diarthrosis objevis.
Hyaline and synovial read-outs recorded.
Status.
We're completing the gross body series.
We'll start molecular studies in one hour.
All right, did you alter their food?
Yes, sir, we should have 4 to 6 hours.
I want all thermal x-ray and electrochemical studies finished by tonight.
- That's not much time.
- It'll have to do.
Our Mr. Browning is getting much too curious.
I have a holograph in my screen.
Restructuring. Read-out normal.
Security reports that drugs were added to the food intake of all four subjects.
The subjects are now asleep and available for pick-up at 2100 hours.
All subjects should be returned to their rooms by 0230.
Begin all graphic studies on my mark.
3,
2,
1,
mark.
I am reading the cytoplasmic structure now.
I want the chemical read-outs, as soon as you've got them.
Affirmative. Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen readings are up.
Camino cytonic channels, hyperbilia, mitochondria, endoplasmic readings are recording.
Magnesium count.
1.7, sir.
Hematology, red cell mass, 2.0 liters.
Hematocrit, 0.44.
This is a time warning to all personnel.
It is now 0210.
All tests must be completed by 0215.
All subjects must be returned to their sleeping quarters by 0230.
Chuck!
- Chuck! Chuck!
- What's the matter?
Oh, I had this awful deram.
It was horrible.
I was in the hospital and these peopple kept hurting me.
And kept hurting me, and I couldn't do anything.
It's all right now, it's over.
Come and sit down.
Here you go, sit down.
I'm sorry, I feel like an idiot.
But... it was so real.
It's no problem. No problem at all.
What are you doing dressed?
Well, to tell the truth, I was on my way to take a little unauthorized tour.
Oh, no, you can't do that.
That could be dangerous.
Socks, I don't know if I've got a real story here or not.
But I'm not going to find out following Duffy around, you know?
If you're going, I'm going.
- Wrong. No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
Just because I get mad at you doesn't mean I want to see you get hurt.
You stay here.
The minute you walk out that door,
I'm going to call Duffy.
Oh, you wouldn't do that.
Try me.
You are the most stubborn woman
I have ever met.
All right, hurry up, go up and change.
But don't take all night!
Where are we going?
Power plant.
What is that, anyway?
Looks like a road map to all the tunnel systems.
Well, is that good?
- That's bingo, Socks.
- Oh.
Come on, lets go.
It's a 400. It's programmed not to stop us.
- Are you sure?
- No!
That's it.
That's the entrance to the tunnels.
Yep, come on.
Are you sure you know where you're going?
- Not entirely.
- Oh, terrific.
Okay.
Where are we?
Right beneath the Research and Development area.
If they're keeping any secrets, this is where they ought to be.
Oh, boy.
Oh, yes. Duffy said they were building an Eastworld.
Duffy said a lot of things.
Come on.
What are you looking for anyway?
How the hell do I know?
I think we ought to get out of here.
Damn it, we just got here.
Just...
We got to get some light in here.
Hmm.
Hey, you don't know what you're doing.
Don't bother me.
I got an insinct for these things.
Turn it off. Will you turn it off?
Maybe they work in a combination.
How impressive.
Oh, for God's sake, let's get out of here.
You know this is about as exciting as a visit to the waterworks.
Oh, lighten up, Socks. Determination is a mark of a good reporter.
Chuck!
Come on!
Down!
- Go!
- Chuck!
Up, up!
Chuck!
Get out of here!
I can't hold it.
Let's go for the other chamber. Come on!
Find something to jam the wheel.
- Where shall I put it?
- Here, here.
Brace it on the table.
Let's get out of here.
What happened?
I don't know.
What the hell are you doing in there, anyway?
Come on out of there.
Is it safe?
You haven't died and gone to heaven, have you? Yeah, it's safe.
You can ckick them in the butt, they won't do nothing.
Come on!
Listen, I don't know how we can thak you.
Just hurry up. We'll do fine.
Ther'll be a whole damn army of iron here in a minute.
- Come on.
- Oh, my God.
Check the white chamber.
You come with me.
Okay, we're safe now.
They won't search down here?
No, no. No iron ever comes down here.
It's too wet for them.
Screws up their circuits.
We had a fire once, the sprinklers went off.
You should've seen them robots.
They were standing around like a bunch of drunks.
There's the power plant right up there.
You can go back the way you got here.
Listen, I would really like to talk to you.
I got nothing to say.
Well, we're reporters, see.
Yeah, I know who you are.
I've been watching you.
Well, what's your name?
Harry Croft.
Well, Mr. Croft, you're just the kind of man we've been looking for.
Someone who knows their way around this place and is not afraid to talk about it.
Now, wait a minute, I did you a favor, because I don't like to see anybody get into trouble.
But I got nothing to talk about.
Well, do you know who Miss Ballard is,
Mr. Croft?
She's a reporter, right?
Oh, hell, she's much more than a reporter.
She's a top television commentator.
She has her own show with 55 million viewers worldwide.
Now, she wants to inerview you for her program, right?
Yes, yes, I do.
What, me?
Well... I was here since the opening.
The first one, way, way back.
And I've seen it all.
That's it. Harry Croft, the man behind the iron mask at Delos.
- Yes.
- Would they see this in Cleveland?
They certainly will.
My mother's in Cleveland.
Hell, man, your mother's going to be proud of you.
I don't know.
All right.
Nobody here, sir.
All right, come with me.
I got a room up top, but... me and Clark, we like our little corner here best of all.
Ths is Clark.
Clark!
Well, hello, Clark.
He's an old 400 series
I saved from the junkyard.
You want some coffee? Booze?
Coffee would be wonderful.
What kind of booze do you have?
Any kind you want, long as it's gin.
Terrific.
Come on, sit down, make yourselves comfortable.
- Okay.
- Give me a coffee and a couple of gins.
And don't forget the ice.
You got to stay on top of him.
He gets a little sloppy sometimes.
Why do you call him Clark?
You know, from Superman,
Clark Kent, man of steel.
Is this his face?
Yeah... I kind of got tired of taking it off every time I had to fix him.
He don't mind.
Oh, it's a sad face.
Well, he used to work at the Roman World.
He was one of the original iron men in all the orgies.
He's seen a lot, Clark has.
It's wonder he can still move at all.
Thank you, Clark.
Yeah, well, I imagine you've seen some things yourself, Harry.
Well, you know.
You... develop a taste for the iron after a while.
It's good.
I remember one night.
Frenchy and I had a couple of girls up here from the Westworld. ooh-wee, we blew a few fuses that night, I'll tell you.
You said Frenchy.
Yeah, it's a guy that used to work here.
Why? Do you know Frenchy?
May I ask what you are doing here at this time of night?
Hi, there.
Yes, we couldn't sleep, wandered around, and found ourselves here.
Not very likely.
Are you calling the lady a liar?
Oh, for heaven's sakes. Harry was just telling us about the good old days.
He would have done better to remember that we do not encourage contact between our employees and our guests.
We're not your guests.
We're reporters.
You invited us here, remember?
So, you can save that line of crap for your robots, mister.
And Dr. Schneider, if we're not allowed to interview anybody we want, then I think that we just better leave Delos right now.
You can talk to anyone you wish.
I merely request that you inform Mr. Duffy and not sneak around at 3 o'clock in the morning.
Surely, that's not too much to ask.
Listen, I was just leaving anyway.
No, that's all right, Harry. It's late.
And I think that we're the ones that ought to be going.
If you follow me, I'll see you to your rooms.
- Chuck?
- Right.
Thanks, Harry, We'll see you.
Yeah, okay.
Clark, give me another gin.
What'd I tell you?
It never changes.
You get mixed up with people, all you got's trouble.
Good night.
Thanks for everything, Doc.
It's been a swell evening.
Mister, if this was your idea of a swell evening, you have got the wrong girl.
No, I don't, and one of these days you're going to be a hell of a reporter.
- What did I do?
- Come with me.
- I thought you'd never ask.
- Come on.
Harry spoke of a Frenchy, remember?
Yeah.
Well, this guy called Frenchy got himself killed trying to tell me about Delos.
Now, I never got the story.
But he was carrying these clippings about heavyweight people from every country on Earth.
You know, bankers and commissars, you name it.
I don't get the connection.
Well, I checked.
And each one of them was a guest at Delos.
Now, I smell a big rat.
But I want to talk to Harry alone and I'm going to need your help, Socks.
Oh, listen I don't know.
I mean, we keep breaking their rules, they're never going to let me back with a video crew.
Anyway, we promised that we would be fair.
Okay, you help me tomorrow. and if I don't get something solid from Harry, then I'll lay off, all right?
Okay, okay.
Hey, you were pretty terrific tonight, do you know that?
Oh, you weren't too shabby yoursef.
I bet you say that to all your copy boys.
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-mm.
I don't.
Shuttle 10-4-3 is clear to proceed to Mars...
Please, expedite repair of the fountain.
4-2-7, do you copy?
We can see the fountain, and it is not functioning in its proper mode.
Do you copy?
4-2-7, please respond.
Yes, I copy, you miseralbe bag of bolts!
If you think you can do any better, get your iron butt down here, otherwise, shut up!
4-2-7, out.
We call it our Inner Space Chamber and we hope to make it a regular part of Futureworld.
The idea is to actually make a videotape of a dream.
You take it with you, play it back, find out what you're thinking about.
That is absolutely incredible.
- You want to try it?
- Go ahead, Socks, go for it.
Well, yes, yes, I do, you know.
Maybe I could use it on the program.
I think you'll find this a unique experience.
- Chuck, would you just wait here?
- You bet.
I gotta see this.
Wait a minute, you mean he can watch?
Unless you object.
Well, I don't know whether I do or not.
I mean, it depends on what I dream, doesn't it?
Well, don't you worry about it.
I won't tell anybody.
All right, wise guy.
It's about time you learned something about women.
- This way.
- Hmm.
Are you sure I won't have a nightmare?
I mean, this thing looks pretty frightening.
Well, we'll see to it that that doesn't happen.
The couch is designed to remove any pressure along the neural spinal column.
And the material bleeds air at the exact tempreature of your body.
So, you'll see nothing, feel nothing, hear nothing.
Your mind will begin to feed on itself.
With my luck, I won't be able to fall asleep.
Bye.
Every thought, like every eye blink or a heartbeat releases currents of electricity, which can be transformed into waves.
She's got a lot on her mind, huh?
Well, we're recording 2,000 different waves from 5,000 separate brain locations.
- Wow.
- Millions of bits of information.
We take it all in... and put it back together.
On this.
- What's this?
- Take a look.
You know what you're seeing?
I can't believe it.
Well, it's true.
You're looking directly into her mind.
We've learned how to convert thought waves back into the images the mind creates.
It isn't perfect, of course.
It'll do. Wow.
Activate the pain-pleasure gradient, please.
Who's that?
- Reference?
- A fantasy lover.
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.
Start a video recording on my mark.
3, 2, 1, mark.
We're losing it. She's waking up.
Better give her a moment.
Real life is a shock after that.
Yeah, I'll bet.
I call.
What'd you got?
I said I'll call.
Damn it, show me your cards!
I'll be go to hell.
All right, what'd you got?
Four kings, huh?
I find out you been cheating,
I'm gonna fry your wires.
All rght, it's my deal.
Five cards stud.
Jokers with aces, straights, and flushes.
Fool around, cheat this time.
All right, ante up!
All right, you just stay away, mister.
I'm in all the trouble I need because of you.
Is that Frenchy?
My God, what happened to him?
Somebody killed him.
I don't know why they'd want to do that.
He never hurt anybody.
What was his job?
He's a workman, same as I am.
He had a run-in with Dr. Schneider and he quit.
Or else he got fired, I don't know.
He talked to me just before he was killed.
He said he had the big story about Delos.
Do you know what he was talking about?
- Do you?
- Maybe.
Well, what?
Do you think they'll treat you any better?
Hmm?
I'm probably going to lose my job, because of this.
But I don't look like I got much of a future anyway.
Come on.
I got something to show you.
Don't you touch them cards.
You know there used to be a couple dozen maintenance men.
In each world.
Now it's all machines except for me and a couple other guys.
Everything changed after they brought out the 700s.
Changed how?
They're just different, that's all.
They think too much.
They don't think for themselves, do they?
No, no, they're iron just like the rest of them.
They don't go anywhere, do anything they're not programmed to.
- But...
- But they got you worried, huh?
- This is it.
- All right.
What is it?
Used to be dead inventory.
I don't know what it is now.
I know one thing. That's the only door in Delos I can't get in.
The only ones allowed in there are the 700s.
What's that?
Write down what I tell you.
Let's try it.
Yeah, I've tried it a dozen times.
I can't get in thoose doors.
Hell, one more time, Harry.
- Come on.
- Okay.
Give me those numbers.
I told you.
- You...?
- No, I don't smoke.
I tried that code every way I could.
I can't get in, just can't get in.
Well, maybe it's not the code, you know?
Maybe it's something else, something personal.
What do you mean?
Fingerprints or voice, you know?
700s haven't got no fingerprints.
Only way you can tell the difference between them is in their eyes.
That's it! Goddamn it, that's it!
Their eyes.
That light reads the circuitry in their eyes.
Come on!
Well, I hope you'll accept my apologies for Chuck's behavior.
I think he's just overtrained for a simple story like Delos.
Well, we're not worried. I'm sure he'll turn up sooner or later.
You know, I find that man, Harry, an interesting character.
I definitely want to use him on the show.
- Harry's one of our old boys.
- Ah.
Mr. Duffy feels sorry for him, but frankly, I think he should have been phased out long ago.
Well, why's that?
His skills are no longer needed.
Our 700s can do it better.
Oh, Mort, that's not entirely true.
We haven't solved the problem of wet areas.
Harry is still quite valuable.
Well, anyway, don't you think it's dangerous to rely too much on the robots?
Don't you think something could go wrong again?
Not at all.
Hey, iron ass!
Are you running correlates on organic emissions?
I have the resonance frequency on the protein molecules.
Electromagnetic shaping positive.
Subject beta-niner.
Energy matrix play out is particulating... now.
It's all right.
Do you know what it is?
Wasn't here before.
It's Karnovski.
Chuck, isn't that...?
It's Takaguchi.
Oh, my God, I don't beleive it.
- They're duplicates.
- What?
They are creating and programming duplicates of real people.
That's what Frenchy's list meant about the politicians and the commissars and the generals.
They've all been replaced by those things.
You'll start the family history program on my mark.
3, 2, 1, mark.
Let us repeat our social attitude program, please.
And add a factor of 5 to the medulla circuit.
You will never harm Delos.
I will never harm Delos.
You will do what Delos instructs you to do.
I will do whatever Delos instructs me to do.
You will destroy your original.
I will destroy my original.
There's a plane leaving in about 3 hours.
We should get back to our rooms, get our stuff together, and get on that flight.
- Yeah, but what about Duffy?
- We'll call him from the airport.
- You know your way back from here?
- You bet.
I wouldn't stay in that room too long.
I don't beleve it's safe.
I'll meet you at the power plant in half an hour.
I know a place we can hide until the plane leaves.
Okay, but if we don't show, you get out best way you can.
- Good luck.
- Okay, come on, let's go.
I'll just be a minute.
All right, I'll try to get Holcombe, tell him what happened.
Operator, I want to make a person-to-person call to Arthur Holcombe,
International Media Corporation.
Right, 7-2-5,
Yeah, sure, I'll wait.
Put the phone down, Chuck.
You're a part of it?
Yes, of couse, I am.
Now, where is Miss Ballard?
She's with Harry.
They're supposed to meet me here.
Well, I suppose it's possible that ocasionally even a newspaper reporter tells the truth.
We'll just go upstairs and check, shall we?
Why are you doing this?
Oh, that should be obvious.
If you read your own newspaper more carefully, you'd understand our position quite easily.
The human being is a very unstable, irrational, violent animal.
Now, hold it.
All our probability studies indicate that if left alone, you'll destroy much of this planet before the end of the decade.
Now, we at Delos are determined to seeing that doesn't happen.
We don't intend to be destroyed by your mistakes.
So, you're replacing human leaders with your own duplicates, huh?
Yes. With duplicates who are programmed to think first of the welfare of Delos and to accept our instructions.
Downstairs.
Why bother with Tracy or me?
Because we need the favorable publicity to attract the top rank of human leadership.
The stories your duplicates create will guarantee that every Chief of State will soon be among our guests.
You can't possibly succeed.
We can and we will.
Look, don't imagine that these duplicates we've created are mere robots.
They are not machines.
They are living beings produced by the genetic information in your own cells.
There are no mechanical parts.
Even those of us who create them can't tell the original from the duplicate.
Jesus!
Shoot him!
Shoot him! I can't hold him!
Now!
What are you doing?
He was much too strong.
What do we do now?
Well, we can't stay here.
What about Westworld?
That was deserted.
Yeah, good idea.
You know I'd take you with me, don't you?
You know that.
It just... It wouldn't work out.
I mean, people on the outside, they just... they never would understand how it is with us.
The hell with them.
When we get this thing straightened out,
I'll be back to get you.
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about it.
You been a good pal to me.
I'm gonna sure miss you.
Watch out for the bad circuit in your arm, you hear?
You got to be careful now.
So long, you ol' bag of bolts.
We'll see you.
Okay.
You wait by the barn.
I'm going to get Harry and be right back.
Okay, look.
- You be careful.
- You bet.
- Go on.
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- Where is Tracy?
- She's safe.
- Great, let's go.
Don't hurry, Chuck.
I'll find you.
Chuck? Chuck?
Hello, Tracy.
Why! Well, you... You can't be.
But I am.
What are you?
You.
Don't run there.
You were going to run to the saloon and hide in the gap between the floorboard and the ground.
How can... How can you know that?
Because I have your mind.
And what you think, I think and what you know, I know.
And now it's too late to run, because we're both within accurate range of these guns.
Yes, I... Yes, I just... I just thought of that.
Yes, I know you did.
It's a good thing Father taught us how to shoot, isn't it?
Yes.
Maybe we shouldn't have worried so much about whether he loved us or not.
No... He was just busy, I guess.
Yes.
Well, it's been good to meet you.
But of course... there can only be one of us.
- Yes.
- And since... since you can read my mind.
I can read yours.
Yes.
Hey, Chuck?
Chuck, this isn't going to get us anywhere, you know?
We're both lousy shots.
Remember Sergeant Rucker at basic?
Browning, you couldn't hit an elephant in the ass at 5 yards with a bazooka.
Be careful, brother.
Don't forget we're afraid of heights.
Oh, good.
Damn good, really.
Well, Chuck, it's been fun.
But I've got a plane to catch and a story to write.
You know what I mean?
Anyway, don't feel too bad.
You're not going to die, exactly.
Just going to be replaced.
I thought I'd see you off personally.
Thank you.
It's just been a fabulous time, really.
I look forward to coming back with a video crew next week.
Really, it was just a wonderful time.
And I hope you'll thank Mr. Duffy for us.
I certainly will.
What about you, Chuck?
Have we satisfied your suspicions?
I'd like to apologize for that.
But I think your patience with me will be rewarded.
I intend to write a story that will make everyone who can afford it, a Delos customer.
Your attention, please.
- That's wonderful.
- Laker Airways anounces the departure
of flight 936 for New York
- Wonderful.
- and San Fransico.
This is the final call for...
Oh, that's us.
- Let's go.
- So long, Doc.
All aboard, please.
They are the... the wrong ones.
Did you talk to Arthur?
Yeah, told him the whole story.
It'll be old news by the time we get home.
Hey, you know, I still don't think that kissing you was a very scientific way of finding out who was who.
Well, there are some things you just can't fake, Socks.
And another thing I must tell you, my dearest Katerina Matveyevna: you're appearing to me as a purest swan, like you swim to wherever you need to go, or on your errands... only it takes my breath away, so happy I feel, as though I was shot pointblank from a cannon.

You should know, my dearest Katerina Matveyevna, that to date, the class battles have been completed by and large, and the day of worldwide liberation is coming.
So it's now time for me to come back home and build a new life in my native land, so dear to my heart.
Two o'clock.
Have you been here long?
It's just my luck!
Back in hospital I'd sworn to myself: as soon as I have a discharge,
I'll go straight home, and not get into any mess.
I've dug up two like you, and nothing happened...
But the third one...
I pulled him out, and he got at my throat. A bandit he was.
That's how it turned out. Buried by his own. I hardly beat him off.
Now I'll dig you up, and good bye.
THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN
Hands down!
A real beast... that Black Abdullah.
Has no pity for anyone.
If we came here a bit later, he would've killed all of them.
Why did he do it, Commander?
What for?
He's a bandit!
When we finally got to these parts,
Abdullah decided to go abroad and shoot his harem... so that no man would have them.
No, with the women, we can't catch up with Abdullah.
That's why he wanted to do away with them, because they hindered him.
But we can't abandon them either.
Here, some dried bread and barley for your trip.
I'm being late. Discharged six months ago, I still knock about those sands.
I haven't been home for years.
There you go. It will last you for a while.
You'll get something else in Pedzhent, but I can't give you any more, sorry.
I've made quite a detour as it is, now I'm going straight ahead.
Once I get as far as the Volga,
Samara will be at a stone's throw.
I'll have no peace as long as Dzhavdet is alive. Why have you dug me up?
Sure, a dead man doesn't have to worry about anything, but it's so boring.
What is it between you and that
Dzhavdet?
He killed my father...
...buried me, took my four sheep, that was all I had.
That... what's his name... Dzhavdet, is he with Black Abdullah or what?
They hate each other.
Dzhavdet is a coward.
Abdullah is a warrior.
Well, Sayid...
Good luck!
Look, Commander.
In the old fortress, you should've taken him through the chimney.
Through the chimney?
Sukhov, give us a hand. With you, we'll finish him off in a jiffy.
You alone are worth a whole platoon, if not a company.
East is a delicate matter.
How come you're here?
- They were shooting.
Look, at least take the women.
Imagine, I've been sitting three days by the old fortress, with no sleep.
I waited for Abdullah to come back for his harem. They tie me hand and foot!
Rakhimov!
I'm going home.
- Take them, and we'll get Abdullah.
He's at Dry Spring now.
You just take them as far as Pedzhent, they will be safer there.
And I'll give you a man, a horse, some cereal...
What do you say, Sukhov?
Sukhov...
Yes, I guess there're none of our men as far as 300 versts from here now.
That's right.
- Then it's agreed.
Mount!
Comrade women!
Don't be afraid!
We'll finish off your exploiting husband, but as of now, you're under command of Comrade Sukhov.
He will feed you and protect you... he's a good man.
Hold it!
Wait!
Stop!
Damn it!
Am I going to wander about this desert for the rest of my life?
Get up!
Don't go to Pedzhent.
Abdullah will come there.
We'll wait and see.
Give him the horse.
Here is the list, Comrade Sukhov.
Zarina,
Djamilya,
Giuzel,
Sayida,
Khafiza,
Zukhra,
Leyla,
Zulfia,
Gyulchatai.
Gyulchatai!
Right turn...
Follow me, young ladies.
My heart is longing for you, my beloved Katerina Matveyevna, like a crane is longing for the sky.
However, there's a hitch.
I think it will delay me for another three days, no more.
Exactly, I was charged, as a class-conscious soldier, to accompany a group of comrades from our brotherly East.
I must admit that they happen to be agreeable folks,
I'd even say, warm ones, with zest.
So my feet are running now over hot sands in the opposite direction, as I am bound by my revolutionary duty.
THIRD DAY
I would also like to inform you that our deployment goes on smoothly, in the atmosphere of fraternal unity and harmony.
We're just treading sands, not sighing for anything, except for you, my only and unforgettable Katerina Matveyevna.
So don't you be grieving, either.
It does no good.
I beg you! Not in the museum!
We have most precious things here.
Wait.
Who are you?
- I'm the museum's curator.
My name is Lebedev.
- I see.
Where's the populace?
- Hiding. Bringing a harem in here!
Look here, Comrade Curator, those nine liberated women of the
East are very precious things, too...
And let's not argue about it.
Any questions?
No questions.
Follow me!
All right, you'll rest here for a day.
Djamilya,
Zarina, Giuzel,
Sayida, Khafiza, Zukhra,
Leyla, Zulfia, Gyulchatai.
Gyulchatai!
"MUSEUM OF THE RED EAST"
Good bye, young ladies!
Comrade Sukhov!
Maybe you'll stay for another day?
- Too much of a good thing.
Sukhov!
- Don't be scared!
Tomorrow Rakhimov will arrive, he will take you on from here.
Sayid, good luck to you!
I'll just take a swim in the sea, and off I go!
Don't let yourself be buried again.
Monsters!
Barbarians!
How are you?
Hands up!
To Red Army soldier Sukhov.
Personalized.
From Brigade Commander M.N. Kovun.
Abdullah had eleven wives. What have you done to the other two?
You just wait, Abdullah will come and tear your tongue out.
Why don't you say something?
- Saving my tongue.
Shall I finish you off right away or you want to be tortured first?
I'd rather be tortured.
Semyon!
Ride to Abdullah!
Don't!
Come on, move!
How come you're here?
They were shooting.
Abdullah got a lot of men.
That's right.
I'm writing to you once again, my dearest Katerina Matveyevna, now that I've got a spare minute.
The warm sun is making me purr, like our tomcat Vaska when he's basking in it, perched on the hedge.
We're sitting now on the sand by the very blue sea, not disturbed by anything.
The sun is so bright here that it makes you see white.
Comrade Sukhov!
What if Rakhimov is delayed?
What happens to us then?
Abdullah will kill us because of them.
Greetings, fathers!
DYNAMITE
We beg your pardon.
Where did you get it?
We've been sitting here for a long time.
Petrukha!
Take the box. We can use it.
- Right.
And tell the girls there will be no
Abdullah, you got it?
Got it!
What is it? - Go away!
Abdullah'll be here tomorrow.
But I can't go now. You see how it turned out. Stay on, Sayid.
There's no Dzhavdet here.
Goodbye, then.
"DORMITORY FOR LIBERATED
WOMEN OF THE EAST"
They took most valuable exhibits.
- What do you mean, exhibits?
I told them to take only worn rugs.
- But these are the 11th century!
As you were!
Don't be afraid.
He's our master.
Master! No one must see our faces. Only you.
You're our new husband.
Tell your man not to come here.
Comrade women!
The Revolution has made you free.
No one owns you anymore.
There's no master.
You can call me simply
Comrade Sukhov.
You may forget your accursed past.
You will work freely now, and each of you will have a separate husband.
Any questions?
No questions.
"DOWN WITH PREJUDICES!
WOMAN IS A HUMAN BEING, TOO"
Gyulchatai!
Show your face.
Don't think I'm just playing...
I may have serious intentions.
I don't mind you were someone's wife. You're just right for me.
I like spirited girls.
I can even propose to you.
I've got a good, kind mother.
Everyone respects her.
Come on, show your face.
- As you were!
Hold it!
Gyulchatai!
- Yes, master.
Go announce a reveille to the girls.
Hold it!
As of today, I appoint you to be in charge at the dormitory here, responsible for the order.
Any questions?
- No.
The master has appointed me his favorite wife.
Comrade Sukhov, I'm very serious,
I want to marry her.
I just want to see her face, what if she looks like a crocodile.
Go to the shore. Find the white house, a former czarist custom house.
Find out who's there now.
Freeze!
Hands up!
D'you know whose house you got in?
Answer me!
- I don't know.
Have you never... heard of Vereschagin?
What have I come to!
In the old times, everyone knew me here.
I had them all in my hand.
Now they forgot.
Hold it!
Stop, I said!
Why did you kill my men, Sayid?
I sent them to tell you not to look for Dzhavdet at Dry Spring.
He's not there.
Go back to Pedzhent.
Your father and my father were friends.
When you happen to get a good companion, the road comes easier.
Your Honorable Excellence,
Lady Separation.
We've become like one with you,
Though with no intention.
Letter in the envelope,
Don't tear it, enough!
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love...
Letter in the envelope,
Don't tear it, enough!
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love...
Your Honorable Excellence,
Dear Lady Luck.
Some you grace with fortune,
Others you would duck.
A bullet in the heart...
Don't call me, enough!
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love.
A bullet in the heart...
Don't call me, enough!
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love.
Hey, good man!
Have you got a light?
Where are you going?
- That's Comrade Sukhov.
So you say it's Sukhov?
Let's check out that Sukhov.
Oh God, forgive me my sins...
Catch it!
Well, come on in!
Have you seen the peacocks in the yard? - I have.
I traded them in... for my uniform.
Petrukha!
I don't drink.
Good for you.
I'm going to finish this and give up, too.
Drink up!
Sit down!
I like your Petrukha very much.
Can you give me a machine-gun?
Are you waiting for Abdullah?
- Yes.
Look, Sukhov, when I had a custom house here, there were the smugglers.
There's no custom house now, there're no smugglers.
In short, I made peace with Abdullah.
Whites or Reds, they make no difference to me.
Whether it's Abdullah, or it's you.
If I went with you, that would be different.
What's the problem, then?
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Hello.
Hello.
Guys!
Come back!
What did you tell me?
What solemn promises you gave me?
Have you gone crazy at your age?
Nastasya...
You'd ruined the best years of my life, and now you want to make me a widow?
Pasha!
Pasha dear!
Pasha!
Forgive me, for Christ's sake!
Don't go!
Don't go with them!
They'll get you killed just for nothing!
Well, guys...
I can't give you the machine-gun.
We understand.
So, it's the peacocks, right?
Who told you to come here?
Have you measured it?
- Exactly three and a half meters!
Will it catch fire?
- It should.
As soon as it does, start counting.
Forty two!
They can go in the motor boat now.
They want to get behind the border.
After they start the motor,
42 seconds and... boom!
That's right.
Clean up here.
The geese...
They may have come from our parts, or just flown over there.
Where are you from?
- A village near Kursk.
Never been there. I left home when I was a kid like you...
I've been knocked around the whole world...
From the Amur river...
- The Amur river?
...to Turkestan.
Before he died, my father said:
"Abdullah, all my life I was poor, and I wish that God send you an expensive robe and a beautiful harness for your horse."
I waited for a long time, then God said:
"Mount your horse and take everything you want yourself, if you're a brave and strong man."
My father didn't say anything.
Dzhavdet killed him in the back.
Your father was a wise man, but who on this earth knows what is good and what is bad?
The dagger's good for the one who has it, and bad for the one who hasn't it... at the right time.
Oh, Allah, where's he, that husband of ours?
It's all her fault,
Gyulchatai's!
When I was Abdullah's favorite wife, you saw him every day.
And he beat us every day.
Our husband forgot about us before he knew us. -Why, we're not that bad.
Maybe, Gyulchatai doesn't caress him well enough?
Or he doesn't like the way she dresses? -Or perhaps...
What's the matter?
How old are you?
Don't even think of that.
Or maybe we'd really get you married?
To Petrukha, in lawful wedlock.
The boy is not married, he wants to take you to his mother.
I'm your wife.
- My wife is at home.
Can't you tell her that
Gyulchatai's your favorite wife?
She won't be offended, will she?
She will!
How many times must I explain it?
We're supposed to have only one wife.
Do you understand?
One!
Wouldn't you like your husband to love, give presents to and caress only you?
You think it's bad?
- It's good.
One wife loves, one makes clothes, one cooks, one feeds the children...
One wife doing all this?
- Nothing can be done about that.
It's hard.
- Sure it's hard.
All right, good night now.
We'll talk tomorrow.
Ibragim!
That's lbragim's robe!
Poor lbragim!
Until I catch them, you'll stay with us.
I would also like to tell you,
Katerina Matveyevna, that sometimes I get so sick at my heart, such sadness grips me with its claws, when I'm wondering how you're doing over there.
What troubles you?
Have you coped with hay making or not?
The grass must have been abundant this year...
Well, our separation won't last long now.
I'll give a bit of help to this group of comrades, settle some other problems, and make my way in your direction, my invaluable Katerina Matveyevna.
Now I beg your pardon, there is a small hitch. I'll finish next time.
Come out, if you're there!
We've been loyal to you, master!
Djamilya...
You've been my favorite wife, haven't you? Have I ever hurt you?
Why aren't you dead?
Drop the gun...
If you turn back, I'll shoot.
Drop it!
Hands up!
Your dagger.
Make five steps forward.
And tell your hirelings to get out of the yard.
I'll let you free as soon as your men leave Pedzhent.
I never miss.
Abdullah, you may put your hands down.
Makhmud!
Gallop to the shore, all of you!
Load the boat and put it on the water.
I'm staying here... as a guest.
But if I'm not there by noon, come back to settle a score...
...for the hospitality.
Get out!
Petrukha!
You stay here.
I'm going to the shore.
To see what the bandits are doing.
They stole Abdullah!
Don't tell anyone...
You better not.
They'll cheat you.
They'll board the boat.
You'll let Abdullah free, and they'll be back.
I don't think so.
Caviar again!
I'm fed up with eating the damn thing every day!
Couldn't you get some bread?
How can I get it now?
Eat it! You got to eat something after drinking.
Everyone in the village is dead scared.
People don't even poke their noses out of doors.
The Revolutionary Committee's
Commissioner and the militia man have not returned from the city yet.
And that red-haired one who was here is said to have gotten Abdullah himself.
I don't like all this.
Oh, God!
Don't you get into this, don't butt in!
You have done your share of fighting.
Gyulchatai!
Show your face.
Come on, show it.
Is someone sneaking around?
Gyulchatai.
Gyulchatai!
Bring some water.
Hands up!
Oh, it's you?
What are you doing there?
Please, don't say a word to anyone.
We have a hiding place here.
Show your face.
Petrukha!
Go away now. Hurry.
You can't stay here alone.
I can't leave either.
Abdullah will kill the women.
- Abdullah will kill you.
They're his wives.
Goodbye.
- I counted on you.
If I'm killed, who's going to take vengeance on Dzhavdet?
I counted on you, Sayid.
And if Fate wills for us not to see each other again,
Katerina Matveyevna, you should know that I have been and will be, to my last breath, devoted only to you alone.
And since it may happen that
I'm buried forever in these sands, this unaccustomed thought even making me feel sad...
Or maybe it's because I've met lately mostly very warm people,
I'd even say, delicate people.
Bearing witness to this is... fighter for the happiness of working people of the whole world, member of the Caspian International
Revolutionary Proletarian Regiment named after Comrade August Bebel,
Red Army man...
Fyodor lvanovich Sukhov.
Have the women left, curator?
I detained them.
Look, this is an underground passage.
It leads to the seashore. It was dug at the time of the Samanid Dynasty.
No one has used it in the last 400 years.
They're not here!
They couldn't have gone far.
Let go of my hand.
Let go, I said.
Why this violence?
- Let him go, Akhmed.
Stop this plunder now!
There're no women here.
And I don't know anything about...
There must be an underground passage here...
Get down!
Cling to the ground!
Follow me!
There's no one here!
They couldn't bury them in the sand.
No one here either.
We can't open it up.
We could blow it up.
- We don't have any grenades.
Leave at least one bullet, Abdullah, to shoot ourselves with.
Your Honorable Excellence,
Lady Foreign Land.
Your embrace is very hot,
But to love you can't.
In your seductive mire
Don't call me, enough.
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love...
Your Honorable Excellence,
Dear Lady Victory.
It seems my song is over...
Still singing?
I came from Abdullah.
We've run out of grenades, and you've got a whole supply.
Stop it!
There'll be luck in love!
And stand up when a lieutenant is talking to you.
Devils, stop your crying
And swearing on blood!
No luck in dying...
He's got wrong grenades.
It's full.
Abdullah!
Are you still wearing a yashmak, or you've changed into men's clothes?
Abdullah, your wives are very tender.
I'm enjoying them.
- I'm giving them to you.
When I set oil on fire, you'll enjoy it even better.
You'll enjoy it very much.
They give us no peace.
One feels like running away.
Some want grenades...
Others want bullets...
May the devil take them!
Come on, move!
Hurry up!
Are you asleep, you bastard?
Shall I wake you up with a lash?
I haven't seen you for ages, Abdullah.
Yes, it's been a long time.
Still leading a nomad's life?
Still shooting?
I got old and lazy.
Remember what I was like?
Those were the times.
What are your men up to?
What do they want to blow up?
Some character got in there, and won't come out.
Fyodor!
Is Petrukha with you?
They killed Petrukha,
Pavel Artemyich!
Abdullah stabbed him to death.
Pasha!
Come on, go!
A good wife and a good home, what else does a man need at his old age?
I may have spent a fortune, but I got some flour.
I'm going to cook borscht and make pancakes.
At least it's some bread.
We've overstayed our time here.
As soon as the commissioner's back, we'll go to Astrakhan.
It's time to tend to our son's grave.
It must've overgrown with weeds...
And we haven't been to church over a year now. It's a great sin.
You'll wear your embroidered shirt.
When I see you in that shirt,
I remember everything...
How we met in the infirmary in Tsaritsyn...
Pasha...
Do you remember the "Prince of
Tauride steamship?
And what a dressing down you gave to that staff-captain at the fair in Kazan?
Hey, Abdullah!
Haven't you got too much goods?
And all of it duty free?
But there's no one at the customs.
Who should I pay duty to?
We could pay you in gold.
You know me well, Abdullah...
I never take bribes.
It pains me to see the state suffering.
Aristarkh!
Settle it with the customs man.
Fire it up!
Wait, Abdullah!
It's me, Sayid, speaking!
What do you mean by that?
Kill him!
Vereschagin!
Leave the boat!
Give it back!
Wash up, guys!
He did go! He did go after all!
Damn him!
Pasha!
Pasha!
Well, have you come to your senses?
Abdullah!
The customs man has cleared it!
Makhmud!
Fire it up!
Get to him from the back, Makhmud!
Don't let him stick his nose out.
Don't start the motor!
I'm going to get closer.
You'll get blown up!
Stop!
I'm here, Abdullah.
You can come out, young ladies.
Your Honorable Excellence,
Dear Lady Luck.
Some you grace with fortune,
Others you would duck.
A bullet in the heart...
Don't call me, enough!
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love.
A bullet in the heart...
Don't call me, enough!
No luck in dying,
There'll be luck in love.
THE SUN WAS NOT UP YET
You'd better wait, will you?
We'll get to the city together, and take the train from there.
No. That's a big detour.
I'll go straight and be there sooner.
Take a horse.
- No.
A horse will be a nuisance.
You have to feed it.
Goodbye.
Well? Djamilya, Zarina, Giuzel,
Sayida, Khafiza, Zukhra,
Leyla, Zulfia.
Goodbye, young ladies.
Sorry if I did something wrong.
Thank you!
Don't mention it.
What about Dzhavdet?
Do you need some help?
No, I'll deal with Dzhavdet myself.
Should you meet him, don't touch him.
Well, good luck, then.
A good day, a pleasant moment.
How are you doing, my precious
Katerina Matveyevna?
Don't judge me too harshly for the delay. It seems to be my fate.
But I think nothing like that is going to happen again.
So I hasten to inform you that I'm alive and well, and hope you're, too.
Nick Nack! Tabasco!
Right away, Monsieur Scaramanga!
Hey.
Half. You get the rest later.
Wait for him in there. Through that door.
He will join you in a minute.
Your steam bath is ready,
Monsieur Scaramanga.
"Oh, that would have been too easy."
"It's locked."
You'll have to look elsewhere, monsieur.
Hey, Al.
Al, wherever you are, don't hold it against me.
I wonder where you can find your gun,
Monsieur Scaramanga.
"Your little golden gun."
"Where can it be?"
"There is something we haven't had before."
"I wonder what it can be."
"I fooled you!"
"You're getting warmer."
"Much warmer."
Now, how are you going to get down the stairs?
"So near and yet so far."
"Bravo, Monsieur Scaramanga."
You've done it again.
- This one was the best, "n'est-ce pas"?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.
But you'll have to do better to come into my money.
I'll get you yet, and I'll enjoy every sou you leave me.
You'll be the death of me yet, Nick Nack.

Good morning, sir.
Colthorpe.
Chief of Staff.
What do you know about a man called Scaramanga, 007?
Scaramanga?
Oh, yes! The Man with the Golden Gun.
Born in a circus. Father, the ringmaster.
Mother, English. A snake charmer.
A spectacular trick-shot artist by the time he was ten and a local Rio gunman at 15.
The KGB trained him in Europe, where he became an overworked, underpaid assassin.
He went independent in the '50s.
Current price: One million dollars a hit.
No... er... photograph on file.
But he does have one distinguishing feature, however. A superfluous papilla.
- A what?
- A mammary gland. A third nipple, sir.
He always uses a golden bullet, hence "Man with the Golden Gun".
Present domicile unknown.
I think that's all.
Why, sir?
Hm! Charming trinket.
- Even has my number on it.
- Precisely.
Obviously it's useless as a bullet.
Who would pay a million dollars to have me killed?
Jealous husbands, outraged chefs, humiliated tailors. The list is endless.
Moreover, this trinket, as you call it, was sent with a note requesting "special delivery" to you.
- It's initialled with an S.
- Scaramanga's fingerprints were on it.
They've been verified by the CIA.
- Why would he alert me?
- Psychological.
He counts on his reputation to terrify his intended victim.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I'm relieving you of your present assignment, 007.
- Er, sir?
- Yes?
The energy crisis is still with us.
I submit that finding Gibson and his solar cell data is more important than ever.
It is indeed.
And I can't jeopardise it or any mission by having Scaramanga put a bullet in you.
I'll endorse your request to resign.
Or you can take a sabbatical and go to ground until this is settled.
Or until he kills me.
Nobody knows where he is or what he looks like.
So I think it's fair to assume that he has the edge on you.
Wouldn't you agree? That's all, 007.
If I found him first, sir, that might change the situation.
Dramatically, wouldn't you say?
Good day, Bond.
Moneypenny, Fairbanks.
- Alaska.
- No. Bill Fairbanks, 002.
Oh, poor Bill.
- I miss him.
- The Man with the Golden Gun didn't.
Officially that was never confirmed.
Where was 002 when it happened?
Beirut, '69.
In a cabaret with a lady called Saida.
Beirut, hm?
Moneypenny, you are better than a computer.
In all sorts of ways.
But you never take advantage of them.
"- Miss Moneypenny.
- Yes, sir."
Oh, just one moment, darling.
Yes, James?
Why wasn't Scaramanga confirmed as the killer?
Because they couldn't find the bullet!
Darling!
Ahmed.
Ahmed!
"Entrez."
Good evening.
My name is Bond. James Bond.
Your dancing is superb.
"- And so are you.
- Merci."
And you are very handsome.
Well, I don't usually intrude like this, but I... I believe we had a mutual friend.
- Bill Fairbanks.
- Fairbanks?
Yes.
I am told you were with him when he was rather, er... rudely interrupted.
Ah, "mais oui" - Bill!
What a terrible night. I will never forget it.
- Did you see who shot him?
- No, I was in his arms.
- My eyes were closed.
- At least he died happy.
The bullet went through him.
- Through his back and ended up there?
- No, no, through his neck.
I take it out of the wall before the police arrive.
And now it is my lucky charm.
I never dance without it.
I'm sure Bill would have loved that.
But let us forget the past.
Mm! I was hoping you'd say that.
Are you staying long in Beirut?
Oh, it depends.
Clumsy of me.
You really do have a magnificent abdomen.
Oh, my perfumes! No!
I've lost my charm!
Not from where "I'm" standing.
Taxi? Hotel, mister?
No. To the nearest pharmacy.
Dumdum bullets like this flatten on impact for maximum wounding effect.
- Very nasty.
- Yes, I'm sure it is.
But just tell me where it was made and by whom.
Well, fortunately it's all in one piece.
20.003 grams.
Which leads us to deduce it was fired from a 4.2 millimetre gun.
Colthorpe, there's no such thing as a 4.2 millimetre gun.
The fact that no recognised munitions manufacturer, military or civil, produces such a bullet doesn't mean it doesn't exist, 007.
Q Branch have been making irregular calibres for most unusual purposes.
- And we don't put markings on them.
- Making identification almost impossible.
You mean we can't trace it? You've no idea what it went through to get here.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
The workmanship is undemanding according to our standards.
Soft 23-carat gold with traces of... nickel.
Hardly ever used in Europe.
Comes from India.
Far East?
- Why not India?
- Nickel content obviously too low, 007.
- Lazar?
- Lazar!
Hm. Imaginative.
Highly specialised.
Yes, I concur.
- Well, what the hell is Lazar?
- Not what. Who. Portuguese.
- Lives in Macau.
- Chap who made the bullet, 007.
I hate to interrupt your dinner, but does Senhor Lazar live here?
Lazar.
I was given this address. Does he...
Senhor Lazar?
My name's Bond. James Bond.
An unexpected honour, Mr Bond.
Your reputation precedes you.
This way, please.
It would be my proudest moment if
I could make something for you, Mr Bond.
A rifle, perhaps.
Now, here we have an interesting problem.
A custom-built model for a client who recently lost two fingers. Please.
- Also lost his trigger.
- It is housed in the butt.
Squeeze it.
The sights are a bit off.
You have five fingers. The butt is balanced for the pressure of three.
That is why you were one inch too low.
Here you will find only craftsmanship and quality.
Mass production, your Walther PPK, for instance,
I leave to others.
What about ammunition?
Designed to individual requirements, whatever they may be.
In gold... if I wanted?
- I have already done that for a client.
- I know you have.
Francisco Scaramanga.
My relationship with a client, Mr Bond, is strictly confidential.
Like a doctor. A priest with a penitent.
Oh, of course!
Yet you make guns for fingerless hoodlums, bullets for assassins.
Mr Bond, bullets do not kill.
It is the finger that pulls the trigger.
Exactly!
I'm now aiming precisely at your groin.
So speak or for ever hold your peace.
I have never seen him.
On a cost-per-bullet basis, he must be your best customer.
True, but unfortunately he only fires them occasionally.
When was the, er... last shipment?
This is impossible. I can't...
You're quite right.
An inch too low.
I have just completed an order for immediate delivery.
- Who collects them?
- I swear, I do not know.
My instructions are to go to the casino.
I am paid and they vanish.
"In a few moments we will be in Hong Kong harbour,"
"one of the busiest ports in the world."
"May I remind you to have passports and landing cards ready,"
"in order to avoid unnecessary delay."
"On your left is the wreckage of the famous liner Queen Elizabeth,"
"which sank here under mysterious circumstances in 1971."
"Ahead, you can now see Kowloon, and on your right, Hong Kong Island."
Taxi!
Follow that Rolls.
Madam, would you be good enough to move this inverted bedpan?
Sorry I'm late, James, but your signal from Macau just reached the office.
You're a great help, Goodnight.
Now, get on to Licence Bureau and trace that car. AU 603, a green Rolls.
A green Rolls?
A green Rolls-Royce.
There can't be that many in Hong Kong.
Courtesy cars. All green Rolls-Royces belong to the Peninsula Hotel.
You see what a two-year posting to Staff Intelligence does for a girl?
James, it's wonderful to see you.
- Where are you going?
- I need some information.
The subject under surveillance is in room 602.
I'll buy you dinner, but first
I have official business to attend to.
Yes, I saw the "official business".
Goodnight, would I do that to you after two years?
Yes, you bloody well would!
- Please.
- I can manage.
You could open a door for me, though.
- I open champagne?
- No, it's a surprise.
Oh! A surprise!
Good afternoon.
- A water pistol?
- Pass me that robe.
Turn around.
Do you always take a shower with a pistol?
Put your hands up and get out of here!
- Keep on walking.
- But you haven't answered my question.
"Reception. Can I help you?"
This is Miss Anders. Room 602.
Put those down!
I see why these packets carry a government warning.
Give me that!
They certainly can damage your health.
- Ow! You're hurting my arm.
- Then tell me where those bullets go.
- No, I can't.
- Try!
- He'll kill me!
- Who?
I can't tell you!
Scaramanga.
You see what you can do when you try?
You work for him?
I don't work for him.
He's, um... I'm his...
Oh. So he's a lover too.
Only before he kills.
Bullfighters do the same thing.
Claims it improves the eye.
His eye is on me. Where can I find him?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I said where?!
I don't know!
He doesn't tell me everything.
I know he has a date at the Bottoms Up Club tonight.
How will I recognise him?
- Tall, slim and dark.
- So is my aunt.
- Anything distinctive about him?
- Yes, but how can I...
He is not like other people. He has three...
Oh.
Fascinating anatomical titbit, but the most useless piece of information I ever heard.
Unless the Bottoms Up is a strip club and Scaramanga is performing there.
You'll have to do better.
He usually wears a white linen suit, black tie, and jewellery, all gold.
You're improving.
I don't want you to twist my arm again.
I don't want to either.
So I'll tell you what you're going to do.
You're going to take the bullets to Mr Scaramanga, because, if he doesn't get them, he may not show up at the Bottoms Up.
And I want him there.
- Why should you trust me?
- I don't.
But neither will Mr Scaramanga, if he hears about this interesting conversation.
Who knows? He may even use one of those little golden bullets on you.
And that would be a pity, because they're "very" expensive.
I'll take them to him.
Let's drink to that.
Bottoms up!
- Soda or ginger ale?
- Ginger ale, please.
Police! Drop it!
Drop it!
You're under arrest.
Move away from there!
If you take the trouble to examine that gun, you'll notice it hasn't been fired.
Anything you have to say, you can say at the station.
I'm charging him under Section 473.
- I didn't see your identity card.
- You will.
Here.
- I thought we were going to the station.
- Kowloon side.
Kowloon's over there!
We're going to the New Territories!
"Welcome aboard, Commander Bond."
"This way, sir."
"Down the hatchway, please."
Good evening, sir.
Would you follow me, please?
It certainly gives you a new slant.
What with the Chinese on one side and the US fleet on the other, down here's the only place in Hong Kong you can't be bugged.
And with current real-estate prices in Hong Kong, quite practical. Any luck?
A Chinese fighter we salvaged.
Good evening, 007.
Glad to see you're still with us.
In future, Commander Bond, if you must tour the world of Suzie Wong by night,
- inform our man here. Lieutenant Hip.
- Sorry, Commander.
I had to get you away from the police, but didn't know how much you knew.
Nothing.
But I should report, sir, that Scaramanga does not have a contract on me.
He couldn't have missed me tonight.
Instead he hit a chap at a club.
- I got a shock when I saw who it was.
- I should think you did.
Our missing solar-energy expert: Gibson.
Yes. Gibson. He was prepared to come back under certain conditions.
That's why I'm here with Professor Frazier.
Lieutenant Hip was making a preliminary contact.
I almost wish that Scaramanga had a contract on you.
Was Gibson cooperative?
He wanted to bargain for immunity.
Suggested another meeting in Bangkok.
- Why Bangkok?
- I think he worked there for Hai Fat.
That name's come up before.
A multimillionaire.
Head of Hai Fat Enterprises.
All legitimate, as far as we know.
What did Gibson propose bargaining with?
A solex. Claimed it was 95% efficient.
If he developed a solar cell that efficient, he solved the energy crisis.
So you've told me.
Coal and oil will soon be depleted.
Uranium's too dangerous.
Geothermal and tidal control too expensive. I know all that.
- Where's the solex now?
- Solex "agitator", sir.
"The" essential unit to convert radiation from the sun into electricity on an industrial basis. It's only that size.
It won't take long to check out Gibson's efficiency claim. This is exciting!
May I see it, Lieutenant?
He showed it to me at the bar and replaced it in his pocket.
And after he was shot, it wasn't there.
I looked.
Gentlemen, I congratulate you.
Instead of getting a perfected solex, we're left with a useless corpse and no leads.
One lead, sir.
Assuming Gibson was killed by Scaramanga, whoever hired him could afford a million dollars.
- Are you suggesting Hai Fat?
- He could afford it.
Out of petty cash.
A thought has occurred to me.
If Hai Fat hired Scaramanga,
- it's unlikely that he met him personally.
- Why?
If anything had gone wrong, there's nothing to connect the two.
That gives me an idea as to how to approach him.
Q, I'll... need this.
- Really, 007!
- Oh, I admit it's a little kinky.
You'll take Miss Goodnight with you.
- Goodnight, sir?
- After tonight's debacle, an efficient liaison officer wouldn't come amiss.
Thank you, sir.
You won't get near Hai Fat.
I have relatives in Bangkok.
I have often passed his place.
He lives in a house on a mountain surrounded by guards.
No way!
The place is crawling with guards.
Have a look.
Hai Fat takes his privacy very seriously.
I'm sure he'll see me.
Good morning. How's the water?
Why don't you come in and find out?
- Sounds very tempting, Miss, er...
- Chew Mee.
Really?
There's only one problem.
I have no swimming trunks.
Neither have I.
What are you doing here?
Get out!
Immediately.
I will have you...
Please forgive me, Mr Scaramanga.
Excuse me, Chew Mee.
Bye-ee.
You understand my surprise.
I thought it was understood.
We were never to meet, Mr Scaramanga.
I always thought your abnormality was a myth.
Some cults consider it a sign of invulnerability and great sexual prowess.
I've learned to live with it.
Why are you here?
Bond. James Bond.
- Do I know the gentleman?
- Well, he knows you.
Without being immodest, there are few people in this part of the world who don't.
And there are very few people who haven't heard of Bond.
British Secret Service,
007, licensed to kill.
He's good, even by my standards.
- He was near the Bottoms Up Club.
- A coincidence.
I don't believe in them.
The man's a menace.
He knows something.
Are you suggesting I invest another million to remove him?
That's up to you.
I will give it some thought.
Since you have chosen to meet me, perhaps you will dine here tonight.
- I'll be delighted.
- Nine o'clock, then.
Ling Po, see this gentleman out.
Don't tell me you saw him?!
He even invited me to dinner.
He must have found me quite titillating.
In due time, I shall be laid to rest here in my mausoleum after a useful, happy, long life.
And I do not intend to allow Mr Bond to shorten it.
I'll get the car.
- You know I'd rather be dining with you.
- I understand, James. Please hurry back.
I'll ring as soon as I do.
A midnight snack might be just the thing.
I'll keep the wine properly chilled.
And everything else warm, I trust.
Bye-bye!
And everything else warm?!
I hope you don't mind giving my nieces a lift.
Good evening.
Hai Fat's is on the way.
I'll drop the girls, come back and wait.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
The name's Scaramanga.
Mr Fat is expecting me.
Grislyland.
A pleasant evening.
Get him! Come on!
Stop it!
Not here.
This is my home.
Take Mr Bond to school.
Heaven.
Definitely heaven.
Tashman.
Chula.
Chula! Chula! Chula!
Chula! Chula! Chula!
Are you all right?
- How did you find me?
- Hai Fat owns this place.
Stand back, girls.
Forgot to tell you!
Their father runs a karate school.
Hang on!
What you might call a Mexican screw-up, gentlemen!
Pretty lady, 100 bahts.
- No, no.
- 80 bahts.
50 bahts.
Pretty lady, real elephant. 60 bahts.
Missy, yesa!
Elephant. Bargain, mister. 100 bahts.
Elephant! Real elephant.
50 bahts.
You are very handsome man. 40 bahts.
For you, mister, 20 bahts.
Sonny, I'll give you 20,000 bahts if you can make this heap go any faster.
20,000 bahts!
- I'm afraid I'll have to owe you.
- Bloody tourist! 20,000 bahts!
Goddamn little brown water hog!
Oh, what's the matter, JW, huh?
You just try that in "my" bayou, boy!
I'd haul your ass!
Oh, look, JW. I just gotta have me one of those cute little elephants.
Elephants!
We're Democrats, Maybelle.
If you got your little pointy heads out of them pajamas, you wouldn't be late for work.
I knew it!
You pointy-heads has no more idea of traffic control than a gooney bird!
Get your cotton-picking schnoz out of my pants. Hear now?
Boy, you is ugly.
JW?
Where are you?
What do they teach in that school?
Ballet dancing?
I find nothing remotely amusing about Mr Bond's escape.
You underestimated him.
Even my influence doesn't extend into the British Secret Service.
I shall lie low too.
I won't jeopardise a project in which I've invested half my fortune, when it's ready to yield billions.
- Where will you hide out?
- That does not concern you.
Take this.
Return it to the plant and don't leave there without my permission.
May I remind you that you work for me.
I took you on as a junior partner to be an occasional convenience. Nothing more.
I did not hire you to interfere in my affairs.
- Is that clearly understood?
- Oh, yes, very clearly.
I now regret having even considered employing your services, but that is beside the point.
Bond doesn't know you're in Bangkok.
He's never seen you, but he knows me.
That's the problem.
That's no problem.
What happened?
Mr Fat has just resigned.
I'm the new chairman of the board.
He always did like that mausoleum.
Put him in it.
Sorry about that, darling. It was Hip.
Still no sign of Hai Fat. Every inquiry gets a polite Oriental brushoff.
With the compliments.
"Phuyuck"?
'74, sir.
- I approve.
- You do?
Oh, not the wine. Your frock.
Tight in all the right places.
Not too many buttons.
Standard uniform for Southeast Asia.
The buttons are down the back.
Designed by Q, no doubt.
One of them's a suicide pill, I suppose.
No. But the bottom one has a homer in it.
How original.
"A toast.
Per ora e per il momento che verrá."
"To this moment, and the moment yet to come."
In our profession, I'm afraid, you never can count on that moment to come.
Who knows where you and I will be this time next year?
Opposite sides of the world, most likely.
That's too far apart.
Now, if Hip doesn't come up with a lead, there's really nothing very much for us to do tonight.
Or is there?
Oh, darling, I'm tempted.
But killing a few hours as one of your passing fancies isn't quite my scene.
Phuyuck!
Ah! Goodnight. What a pleasant surprise.
My hard-to-get act didn't last very long, did it?
I was trained to expect the unexpected, but... they never prepared me for anything like you in a nightie.
James, I thought this would never happen.
- What made you change your mind?
- I'm weak.
Don't move!
Miss Anders! I didn't recognise you with your clothes on.
I bribed a bellboy to let me in.
I've come to warn you, you're in great danger.
I usually am. That's why I use the old three-pillow trick.
Please believe me.
I'm risking my life to come here.
Well, your concern for my wellbeing is touching, but puzzles me.
- Scaramanga is in Bangkok.
- He was in Hong Kong, but not after me.
We've been through that routine.
He's a monster. I hate him.
Then leave him.
You don't walk out on Scaramanga.
- There's no place he wouldn't find me.
- You need a good lawyer.
I need 007.
Who do you think sent that bullet to London with your number on it?
I did.
And it wasn't easy getting his fingerprint on the note.
Forgive me if I've been slow on the uptake.
Don't you see you're the only man in the world who can kill him?
Now, what gives you that idea?
The way Scaramanga speaks about you.
- Even has a likeness of you.
- I'm flattered.
I want him dead.
Name your price. Anything, I'll pay it.
You can have me too, if you like.
I'm not unattractive.
At last you're starting to tell the truth.
I've dreamed about you setting me free.
I've been dreaming about a solex agitator.
Ever heard of one?
Perhaps you can have that too.
- No, my clothes are in there.
- Get in.
- I'll kill that woman.
- Later!
Charming.
It was an inspiration, sending that bullet.
You're late.
It was a double feature.
What are you doing?
Putting my jewellery away.
You can come out now.
- What time is it?
- Two-ish.
Two? You mean
I've been in here for two hours?
All in the line of duty.
Duty! I'm resigning in the morning!
Goodnight, don't let us down.
The Service needs women like you.
Well, obviously you don't!
Forgive me, darling.
Your turn will come, I promise.
As soon as she brings me that solex.
- For killing Scaramanga?
- If she gets me the solex agitator first.
First?
James, you must be good.
Oh. We'll find out about that the next time I meet her.
She's making the arrangements.
Sorry I'm late.
Bangkok traffic's worse than Piccadilly.
He's made contact.
- How's the charm boy doing?
- Need you ask?
Meet you outside.
Did you bring it?
Darling, I left it in your handbag.
It must be in here somewhere, dear.
I saw the man in the shop give it to you.
Without the ticket, we can't get a receipt.
You won't find it in there, Mr Bond.
I looked before you came.
I wouldn't do that either. Look behind you.
Lower.
A gun in a bag of peanuts. How original.
What will they think of next?
My name is Scaramanga.
Francisco Scaramanga.
I feel I know you, although
I never thought we should ever meet.
It's a very great pleasure for me, Mr Bond, thanks to Miss Anders.
You've a strange way of showing gratitude.
A mistress cannot serve two masters.
A difficult shot, but most gratifying.
Well, we, er... all get our jollies one way or another.
Mine have always been guns, Mr Bond.
When I was a boy
I was brought up in a circus.
My only real friend was a magnificent African bull elephant.
One day his handler mistreated him and he went berserk.
Bleeding, dying, he came and found me.
Stood on one leg - his best trick - picked me up and put me on his back.
The man emptied the gun into his eye.
- I emptied my stage pistol into his.
- An eye for an eye. Nut?
You see, Mr Bond,
I always thought I liked animals.
Then I discovered that
I liked killing people even more.
Keep this. Whatever you do, don't lose it.
- I have to help James.
- Something's wrong?
- There's a midget with a gun on him.
- A midget?
Same one I saw at the Bottoms Up.
The girl is dead. Call the police!
Forget the girl. She's replaceable.
And I shall find what she stole from me.
Personally, I have nothing against you, so let's hope our paths never cross again.
Please don't try to follow me.
Your peanut-toting friend back there wouldn't like it.
No, he wouldn't.
You want to try one of mine?
- Where's the solex?
- With Goodnight.
- Where's Goodnight?
- Outside.
She must be by the car.
Women! Walkie-talkie.
- Goodnight, where are you?
- Somebody locked me in a boot.
"- In a what?!
- The midget's car. I'm locked in."
"It's a bronze car with a black roof.
Number 7543."
- The keys!
- I haven't got them.
Oh, no.
"- Goodnight, where are the car keys?
- Oh, I've got the keys."
And I've got the solex too.
Taxi!
Stay in there, Goodnight.
We've got you spotted.
Taxi! Taxi!
Taxi!
- How 'bout a demonstration, boy?
- Certainly, sir.
What the hell is goin' on?!
Now... I know you!
Oh, no.
You're that secret agent.
That English secret agent from England.
You're chasin' somebody.
Who are you after this time, boy?
Commies?
Let's go get 'em! I'm with you all the way.
Uh-oh. I think we've got trouble.
Pull your cars over, you little brown pointy-heads!
I'm a peace officer!
"James? Are you still there?"
"James!"
Can you hear me? James!
All right, Goodnight. Don't panic.
- Who's that?
- It's, er...
- It's Headquarters.
- Let me talk to 'em.
Hello. This is Sheriff JW Pepper,
"Louisiana State Police."
"You call my wife at the Narai Hotel and tell her I'm on a mission."
I've been deputised. Right?
Right.
Which car are we all chasin', boy?
Move it! Move it!
Get that piece of junk off of the road.
They went left, boy.
Press that pedal, boy.
Where the hell have they got to?
You goofed, boy.
Nearest bridge is two miles back.
Goddamn! What the...
What's goin' on?
What the hell are you doin' now, boy?
The bridge is "that" way!
You're not thinking of...?
I sure am, boy!
Ever heard of Evel Knievel?
Wowee!
I ain't never done that before!
Neither have I, actually.
Let's go get 'em, boy!
You stay put, boy.
This is "my" department.
Glad to see you boys on the ball!
Sheriff JW Pepper, Louisiana State Police.
Here's my identification.
Law Enforcement Association,
American Legion.
Me and my partner here, we're on a secret mission.
What the hell you doing?
Give me my wallet back.
Doors.
You can't do this to me.
I want my wallet back.
Take these goddamn bracelets off!
I'm gonna sue ya for false arrest!
Police brutality. I got connections.
I'm gonna get the FBI on your ass!
The CIA!
Goddamn it,
I'm gonna get Henry Kissinger!
Now look at me when I'm talkin' to ya, boy.
What's the matter?
Ain't none of you seen a plane before?
"James? James, are you still there?"
"Can you hear me?"
"I think we've stopped."
That is really all there is to report, sir.
So, if I heard correctly,
Scaramanga got away.
Yes, sir.
- In a car that sprouted wings.
- That's perfectly feasible, sir.
- In fact, we're working on one now.
- Oh, Q! Shut up.
- Miss Goodnight was in the boot?
- Yes, sir.
We found the car-plane abandoned about 200 miles west of Bangkok.
- And the solex?
- In Goodnight's handbag, sir.
- Where's Goodnight now?
- We don't know, sir.
Communications aren't getting the signal from the homer she has supplied by Q.
Rubbish! They're simply not stepping up the reception to enable...
Oh, shut up, Q!
Of all the fouled-up, half-witted operations!
- What do you want?
- We've picked up Goodnight's signal, sir.
- Well, that's something.
- But there's something rather curious, sir.
Our sector's here, and we're receiving her signal from somewhere off this coastline here.
Now here it is on a much larger scale.
That's where she is.
In this group of small islands.
That's all we need! Red Chinese waters.
We could stray inadvertently into them, sir.
- I could fly low under their radar screen.
- Absolutely out of the question.
If the PM gets to hear of this, he'll hang me from the yardarm.
Officially you won't know a thing about it, sir.
There's a small seaplane approaching your island.
Do you want us to take action?
No. No, please don't do anything.
Yes, it's a... guest I'm expecting.
No, he won't be leaving.
"Bonjour, Monsieur Bond."
I am Nick Nack.
"Dom Pérignon soixante-quatre."
I prefer the '62 myself.
Still, beats a bag of peanuts.
Monsieur Scaramanga will welcome you personally.
Forgive me, Mr Bond.
A vulgar display, but I couldn't resist it because I am so delighted to see you again.
A harmless toy.
I am, as you can see now, completely unarmed.
Cigarette?
We have so much in common and so much to discuss.
We will never have this chance again.
Ours is the loneliest profession, so let us spend a few pleasant hours together.
How can I refuse such a gracious invitation?
Splendid. Splendid!
Nick Nack, I expect you to surpass yourself. He's a cordon bleu, you know?
By the way, where's Miss Goodnight?
Oh, she's around here somewhere.
She can't leave, so she does as she pleases.
How do you like my island?
A bit off the beaten track.
It's rent-free.
I do my landlords an occasional favour.
A cosy arrangement.
- Servant problem, I suppose?
- Not at all.
Nick Nack does for me very nicely.
Usually there's just us two, but guests are no inconvenience.
We're entirely self-supporting. We have every electrical device you can think of.
This is an airlock, as you are doubtless aware.
Automatic, of course.
Naturally, we have an ample supply of electricity here.
Let me show you.
This should run a few electric toothbrushes.
Up here.
A solar-energy station.
So this is what it's all about. Ah!
Thermoelectric generators to convert solar energy into electricity.
All built by Hai Fat's construction company, no doubt.
Somehow I seem to have inherited it from him. It's all fully automated.
Kra looks after maintenance and security in here. Nick Nack does everything else.
They tell me the electricity is stored in here... somewhere.
Science was never my strong point.
Superconductivity coils cooled by liquid helium.
If I were you, I wouldn't stick my finger - or anything else, for that matter - in there.
At 453% below zero, that liquid helium would break it off like an icicle.
You really know far more about it than I do.
I'm arranging for countries that can afford the price to send experts here to see this.
But no solex until the money is in the bank, right?
Right.
- I have run across similar situations.
- Not what I've got here.
This way the highest bidder can build hundreds of stations and sell franchises for hundreds more.
He will literally have the sun in his pocket.
A monopoly on solar power.
The oil sheikhs will pay you just to keep solar energy "off" the market.
The thought had occurred to me.
This is the collection point.
Ah! So that's where it belongs.
Our famous solex in the still down there transmits heat to the thermal generators.
It's collected through this?
But where is it collected from?
You need the sun.
Watch that mushroom-shaped rock.
Ingenious, isn't it?
The panels lock on to the sun, then track it automatically.
Something like that, yes.
Ah. Reflected through this, those panels must produce a heat of at least 3,500%F.
If you say so, Mr Bond.
But I do know we can focus the power wherever we want. Here, I'll show you.
This is a bonus.
Goes with the solex. No extra charge.
This is the part I really like.
Now that's what I call solar power.
That's what I call trouble.
You must admit I am now undeniably the Man with the Golden Gun.
Lunch.
This way, Mr Bond.
Ah, Miss Goodnight!
- James!
- Aren't we a little overdressed?
I like a girl in a bikini.
No concealed weapons.
Miss Goodnight, please. Mr Bond.
Let's see what Nick Nack has for us.
Ah, mushrooms.
The fried mushroom looks terribly interesting.
Yes, I'd noticed that.
I'll get around to it later.
- Having fun in the sun, Goodnight?
- Yes!
I could stay here for ever.
Mm, excellent.
- Slightly reminiscent of a '34 Mouton.
- Then I must add it to my cellar.
You live well, Scaramanga.
At a million dollars a contract,
I can afford to, Mr Bond.
You work for peanuts. A "well done" from the Queen and a pittance of a pension.
Apart from that, we are the same.
To us, Mr Bond. We are the best.
There's a useful four-letter word, and you're full of it.
When I kill it's under specific orders of my government.
And those I kill are themselves killers.
Come, come, Mr Bond.
You disappoint me.
You get as much fulfilment out of killing as I do. Admit it.
- I admit killing you would be a pleasure.
- You should have done that before.
But then the English don't think it's sporting to kill in cold blood.
Don't count on that.
I could have shot you when you landed, but that would have been too easy.
You see, Mr Bond, like every great artist, I want to create an indisputable masterpiece once in my lifetime.
The death of 007, "mano a mano", face to face, will be mine.
You mean stuffed and displayed over your rocky mantelpiece.
That's an amusing idea, but I was thinking in terms of history.
A duel between titans.
My golden gun against your Walther PPK.
Each of us with a 50-50 chance.
Six bullets to your one?
I only need one.
Sounds a bit old-fashioned, doesn't it?
I mean, pistols at dawn, that sort of thing.
Indeed it is, Mr Bond.
But it still remains the only "true" test for gentlemen.
I doubt if you qualify on that score.
However, I accept.
As soon as I have finished this delicious lunch that Nick Nack has prepared for us.
"Messieurs", I will remind you, this is "un duel á la mort".
Only one of you can leave the field of honour.
If a "coup de grâce" is necessary, as your referee, I will administer it myself.
"I do not expect wounds, only a clean kill."
"On my command each contestant will take 20 paces."
Are you ready, Monsieur Scaramanga?
- Ready.
- Are you ready, Monsieur Bond?
- Ready.
- I will now begin the count.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,
"thirteen, fourteen," fifteen, sixteen,
"seventeen, eighteen," nineteen, twenty!
If you kill him, all this be mine.
This way, Monsieur Bond.
- Monsieur, good shooting.
- I've never killed a midget before.
But there can always be a first time.
Oh, monsieur!
"You only have three bullets left."
"I have fooled you."
- Goodnight!
- James!
Oh, James!
Steady, Goodnight.
Where is he?
Flat on his "coup de grâce".
Come on, let's get out of this fun palace and find that solex.
Wait here.
I'll take care of the maintenance man.
I already did.
I laid him out cold.
- You did?
- Yes.
There's more to you than meets the eye.
I hate to ask stupid questions, but where exactly did you knock him cold?
He landed in that one.
Don't you believe in signs?
We've got five minutes before his body temperature raises the helium above zero.
Then this whole damn place will go sky-high.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Kill the beam!
- Hit the master override switch!
- The what?
- Goodnight?
- Yes, James?
Now listen carefully.
There's a console up there.
Now, there must be a scanner interlock button on it. Push it!
Are you still there?
It'll be on the auxiliary feedback circuit.
"Computer interlock..." Is that it?
Just push every damn button, will you?
Good girl, Goodnight. You've done it.
Oh, I have.
Goodnight, get the hell out of there!
I've done it.
- I hope you can swim, Goodnight.
- This way.
His junk is moored around the corner.
- But, darling, who is at the wheel?
- George.
George?
Automatic pilot.
We should make Hong Kong in about... eight hours.
Give or... take a little.
I always wanted to take a slow boat "from" China.
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you!
Why, you...!
Hey! Let me out!
Hey, what are you doing?
Ouch!
No, no, no! I can't breathe!
Ow! You'll be sorry.
I may be small, but I never forget.
I kill you if you don't let me out of here!
Ow! Let me out, you big bully!
Shut up.
- What did you do with him?
- What do you think?
- Oh, James, you didn't!
- Yes, I damn well did.
Got all the glass out of the bed, I trust?
We don't want anything else to disturb our peace, do we?
Now, where were we?
Oh, James!
Mmm...
What's the matter?
Something came up.
Hello?
Ah, there you are, Bond.
"Well done. Congratulations."
Thank you, sir.
"Is Miss Goodnight with you?
I'd like a word with her."
Hold on, sir.
"Bond? Bond, are you there?"
"Goodnight?"
She's just coming, sir.
Goodnight?
"Goodnight?"
"- Goodnight!
- Good night, sir."
"Good night, good night"
"Sleep well, my dear"
"No need to fear"
"James Bond is here"
"Oh, love is required whenever he's hired"
"It comes just before the kill"
"No one can catch him"
"No hit man can match him"
"For his million-dollar skill"
"One golden shot means another poor victim"
"Has come to a glittering end"
"If you want to get rid of someone"
"The Man with the Golden Gun"
"Will get it done"
"He'll shoot anyone"
"With his golden gun"
Let's get back to the lunch.
Don't you think the most important part of a meal is the wine?
Everything must follow the wine.
And in this case,
I could favor a red Bordeaux.
A red Bordeaux at lunch?
Your late husband would never have approved.
William!
William, stay away from the edge!
The edge is no place to play!
Yes, ma'am.
What is it, William?
I don't know.
He's got a knife in his back.
William!
Run, William! William!
- Joseph, over there!
- Get down, Eden!
Damn.
Joseph!
Leave us alone. You hear?
Get back! Leave us alone!
Come, girl.
Come on.
I am the Raisuli.
Do not laugh at me again.
Secretary of state to the president.
I regret to inform you that I have received the following dispatch... from Samuel Gummere, United States general consul, Tangier, Morocco.
On October 15, Mrs. Eden Pedecaris and her children... were kidnapped from their residence in Tangier... after the brutal murder of her servants and a guest...
Sir Joshua Kenyon-Smith, a British subject.
The act of barbarous criminality appears perpetrated by Mulay El-Raisuli...
Sharif of the Rifian Berbers and the last of the Barbary pirates.
The British minister and myself concur there exists... alarming prospects of danger for all foreigners in Morocco.
Request warships.
Gentlemen, the presidency was never won by a vice president... filling out his fallen predecessor's term of office.
That may not be in this instance...
The only thing people will remember about McKinley... is he got himself shot.
Teddy's the most popular president since Washington.
Why drag in Washington?
You know it and I know it, but that damn cowboy doesn't know it.
What he wants is some issue to hang his campaign on... something to arouse the populace.
- A cavalry charge?
- So to speak.
Morocco?
You know as well as I do we can't have Arab desperadoes... running around kidnapping
American citizens.
If I had my way,
I'd go in with Winchesters... a battalion of Marines...
- I can't do that. Can I?
- No.
- Has this Raspuli?
- Raisuli.
Raspuli, Raisuli, whatever.
- Has he made any terms?
- No.
- Good, that gives us an excuse.
- He will, though.
What makes you so sure?
He kidnapped a British consul once... but they became friends, and he sent him back. Spat on the blood money.
Yes. There's been others, though,
Spanish and French emissaries.
Send them back too?
- Parts of them.
- Parts of them?
Obviously, he has no respect for human life.
Threatening the lives and property of American citizens... it's an insult in the eyes of the world community.
Arabian thief holding me up like a common desperado.
Theodore, you're on to something.
I don't quite know what.
- What is it that you want, Theodore?
- What do I want? I want respect!
That's what. Respect for human life and American property.
And I'll send the Atlantic squadron to Morocco to get respect.
That's illegal.
Why spoil the beauty of a thing with legality?
The fleet sails tomorrow.
America wants Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!
Very good.
Pedecaris alive... or Raisuli dead.
Bull's-eye!
Don't touch me with that thing again!
I'm quite capable of understanding your gibberish!
Jennifer.
- William? William!
- Your hand, lady.
Oh, get away from me, for God's sake, you...
Get on those horses, Jennifer.
Let go of this!
Now I don't know who you are or what you want with us... but I will tell you that I am no coward.
And if you or any of these men should dare to lay a hand on me...
I will try with all the strength in me to kill you... and with my last breath,
I shall curse you to God!
God will listen!
- Do you play checkers?
- No, I play chess.
Better.
This is the RIF.
I am Mulay Achmed Mohammed
El-Raisuli the Magnificent...
Sheriff of the Rifian Berbers.
I am the true defender of the faithful... the blood of the prophet runs in me... and I am but a servant of his will.
You have nothing to say?
It has never been my intention to encourage braggarts.
Your shell is strong like a turtle's... but it is brittle.
Your tongue is clever and fast.
Be careful you do not trip over it.
You are a great deal of trouble.
Now see here, Abal, I don't intend to waste any more time watching you eat.
This is an effrontery.
Have you ever heard of the big stick, Bashaw?
Do not threaten me, Mr. Gummere.
I have been threatened by the French...
Germans and the English.
I've been threatened by experts,
Mr. Gummere.
And yet Morocco is still the only sovereign Moslem throne... west of Constantinople.
- Yes, but it is shaky.
Yes, we have French infantry and German cavalry.
Our currency is Spanish, but my nephew is the sultan of Morocco.
And it is as it shall be.
Well, if you wish it to stay that way... then I implore you to send your French infantry... and your German cavalry into the RIF and bring our people back.
Better to serve the leopards than the fox.
I am only a servant of the sultan, the chosen one, the defender of the faithful.
I can make no such decision.
Very well then, we shall seek an audience with the sultan himself.
He will not see you... unless it pleases him.
Now listen here, we represent a modern power!
We're talking about Marines, battleships, big guns.
- We are not fooling about.
- Richard.
We are not here to make threats... merely entreaties.
Now tell me, Bashaw, what would please the sultan? Gold?
More bicycles?
- Another carriage?
- Lions.
Lions would please the sultan.
Lions are noble.
Very well.
Mr. Dreighton will leave this afternoon for Fez with a pair of lions.
Lions?
We shall drink from my well.
Thank you, William.
That's rather refreshing.
Here, children, have some of these.
They'll give you strength.
Mama, who do you think he really is?
- Is he a pirate?
- He's a brigand and a lout.
Pay him no serious mention. We shall see the better side of this, God willing.
He has the way about him, doesn't he?
He sure has the way.
Woman, I want you to understand this.
I am not a barbarous man.
I am a scholar and a leader to my people.
I am not a barbarous man.
These four men have dishonored me.
They have eaten from my trees.
They have drunk water from my wells.
They have done all of these things to me... and they have not even evoked my name to God in thankfulness.
I am treated this way because
I make war upon the Europeans.
You see the man at the well?
How he draws the water?
When one bucket empties, the other fills.
It is so with the world.
At present, you are full of power.
But you are spilling it wastefully... and Islam is lapping up the drops as they spill from your bucket.
Did you see that?
And you are not a barbarous man!
- They had broken God's will.
- You mean your will!
I have no will, only that of God.
I had to kill the two, or I could not trust the other two.
A barbarous man would have killed them all.
Be not so quick to judge our ways.
Ignorance is a steep hill with rocks at the bottom.
Do you pray often?
- I pray to Mecca five times a day.
- Is that so?
I wonder how you find time. You're so busy cutting off men's heads... and kidnapping women and children.
- If I miss the morning prayer...
I pray twice in the afternoon.
Allah is very understanding.
You gonna build that canal in Panama, Teddy?
I'll dig it with my own hands if I have to!
Remember the Maine!
I remembered it, did you?
Teddy, you ain't gonna let them push us around in Morocco?
Madam, I have something to say about Morocco.
This is a good time as any to say it.
It is my policy...
It's my policy to protect American citizens and American interests... whenever, wherever they are threatened!
And furthermore...
I am not a man to stand by and condone barbaric acts... which are perpetrated against innocent women and children!
We shall mete out justice that is swift and retribution that is final!
American wants Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!
I was good. Wasn't I, John?
It was a marvelous speech.
I'd even vote for you myself.
Have the train go slowly.
I want to listen to them a while.
You will be more pleased here.
Sleep better.
It is the wish of the Raisuli.
Be sure and thank him for me.
You will sleep here.
Yes, I was told.
Good.
You do not want to eat?
This is not a good move.
I can take your knight.
- You can?
- Yes.
Well, the loss of my knight does not mean you will win.
The lion takes long strides, but the path is worn smooth by pygmy armies.
Yes, and a fool and his money are soon parted.
I've checked your queen also.
You are in a lot of trouble.
You should never have moved that bishop or kidnapped me.
Both will see you undone.
It is not I who decides the outcome of these events.
It is the will of Allah.
I am but an instrument of that will.
It is the wind that passes, but the sea remains.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Make your move.
What do you intend to do with us?
It is my intention to embarrass Mulay
Abd Al-Aziz, the sultan to Morocco.
The tribesmen will see that he is the bought dog of the European armies... a slave to French and
German masters.
The tribesmen will join me in a jihad to abolish this foreign pestilence.
And this is your way, abducting women and children, killing unarmed servants?
I prefer to fight the European armies, but they do not fight as men.
They fight as dogs.
Men prefer to fight with swords so they can see each other's eyes.
Sometimes this is not possible.
Then they fight with rifles.
The Europeans have guns that fire many times promiscuously and rend the earth.
There is no honor in this.
Nothing is decided from this.
Therefore, I shall take women and children when it pleases me.
What have you demanded for our return?
Gold... rifles... the head of the Bashaw in a basket of melons... the sovereignty of my people.
The English have paid very well in the past.
You'll not have your way with the Americans.
President Roosevelt will have your head for this!
This President Roosevelt, he would try and take it himself?
He certainly would. He is a man of grit and strong moral fiber.
He does not kidnap women and children!
- What kind of rifle does he use?
- A Winchester.
Winchester?
Winchester?
- I have no knowledge of this rifle.
- You will.
Sharif of Wazan, lord of the desert.
- Mrs. Pedecaris.
- The pleasure is mine.
Charmed.
The sherif has honored me by carrying my entreaties to the Europeans.
What is that?
That is a tongue.
Well, why would anyone want to cut out a man's tongue?
Perhaps the previous owner had nothing pleasant to say.
I believe I'm about to be sick.
Must be the heat.
- What is it?
- Some kind of tongue.
Children, get up from that tongue!
Good God!
The reply from the American Bashaw.
- Speaking for the lord of the Americans.
- President Roosevelt?
"Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead"?
You are not in a position to laugh.
Do not laugh at the Raisuli!
Go to Zinat.
Cut the small finger from a woman, take it to these Americans... tell them it is a finger of the woman Pedecaris... and that the Raisuli is a man of patience, but not unending.
Does this president, this Roosevelt?
Does he have no respect for human life?
Hey, what'd you bring in, colonel?
Got some venison and a cougar.
- Heard about the bear, have you?
- Big one, I heard.
Coffee, Mr. President?
Is that the bear?
Yes, this is the bear that attacked the horse camp at dawn.
He knew that men would be asleep or at their worst at dawn.
He injured one of the Indians severely.
Killed several of the horses too.
Did you participate in stopping the bear, Mr. President?
Yes, I regret to say.
- Why do you regret, Mr. President?
- Because he's a fine creature.
This is his valley.
This valley belonged to the bear, and we're the intruders here.
We're accustomed to wild animals taking flight at the sight of men with guns.
The American grizzly fears nothing... not man, not guns, not death.
Do you intend to have this bear as a rug in the White House?
Rug? No.
No, I intend to have him stuffed and placed on exhibit.
The Smithsonian Institute.
The American grizzly bear is a symbol of the American character.
Strength. Intelligence. Ferocity.
A little blind and reckless at times... but courageous beyond all doubt.
And one other trait that goes with all previous.
- And that, Mr. President?
- Loneliness.
A bear lives out his life alone... indomitable, unconquered, but always alone.
He has no real allies, only enemies, but none of them are as great as he.
Do you feel this might be an American trait?
Certainly. The world will never love us.
It may respect us... they may even grow to fear us, but they will never love us.
For we have too much audacity... and we're a bit blind and reckless at times too.
Are you perhaps referring to the Panama
Canal and the situation in Morocco?
If you say so.
The American grizzly embodies the spirit of America.
He should be our symbol, not that ridiculous eagle.
He's no more than a dandified vulture.
Dandified.
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, sire.
Tell me, why doesn't the sultan build the road to Fez?
I had to bring these lions by camel.
- Do you know what that's like?
- No, sire.
It wasn't easy.
The ease of others is not the concern of the sultan.
- We'll build a road someday.
- A road? Here?
Foolish. The desert is like the sea.
You cannot build a road in the sea.
We will.
We have men that can do anything.
Absolutely anything.
- We have men that can fly.
- Fly?
Fly.
Watch the goal. Watch the goal.
Watch the goal.
Say, haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Perhaps Your Highness would care to fire the Maxim gun?
Herr Sultan is displeased?
This is broken. Mend it!
The ambassador of the American, your exultancy.
I am Mulay Abd Al-Aziz, sultan to Morocco.
It has been said that you have brought me lions.
Yes, sir, two of them.
It's out of bounds.
It would please me to take the pleasure of this meeting in my carriage of state.
You will come.
- Beautiful!
- It is quite extraordinary.
You may sit.
- You wish to discuss the Raisuli?
- Yes.
Have you made any contact with his people?
He wishes for the return of the woman Pedecaris... that he be granted the lands of the RIF by formal decree... and that the Bashaw of Tangier's head be presented in a golden jar.
- He didn't ask for money?
- Yes, but that is honorable.
- You have offered to pay it?
- Do not distress me by such a question.
See here, we will have our people back and right quick... or we will do something about it!
- I will not endure this treatment!
Have you ever heard of the big stick, sultan?
There are squadrons of warships in your coastal waters.
In days there will be Marines, cavalry and artillery to enforce my demands.
Now, my country wants the woman
Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!
You cannot talk to the defender of the faithful in this manner!
You do not understand it!
It is so difficult to be sultan.
You do not understand.
What do you know of this Raisuli?
He is a wonderful man, a servant of God.
But he is a brigand and a criminal as well.
He taught me to shoot a rifle when I was 5 years old.
- You know him?
- He is my uncle.
But the Bashaw in Tangier is your uncle.
They are both my uncles.
They are brothers.
It is so difficult to be sultan.
You foreigners do not understand.
These are my true riches.
A man's worth is counted in the number of his rifles.
Does this Roosevelt?
Does he have such men?
Probably not.
Well, with such men, who needs guns that fire many times promiscuously?
- Machine guns?
- Yes. Who needs such guns?
Well, maybe I don't believe it either.
Look at this.
Where'd you get it, William?
Did you steal it?
No, he gave it to me.
Gayaan the Terrible.
He's a brigand who's killed over 30 men.
Did he kill any with that?
Certainly.
- What will they do with us, William?
- Keep us.
Teach us to ride... shoot... cut men's throats... and be brigands.
- Even girls?
- Yes, but you'll have to wear a veil.
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
That nobody can deny
That nobody can deny
That nobody can deny
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
That nobody can deny
- Happy birthday, Father!
- Happy birthday!
- Blow out the candles, Father!
- Takes a big wind, lots of hot air.
Then I'll need help from you, Mr. Hay.
I propose a toast.
To the Panama Canal.
Yes, and Jupiter Pierpont Morgan.
Likie knifie? You likie forkie?
Splendid.
And now, Mr. President, blow.
May the breath of Theodore Roosevelt be like the wind... that he has sent across the Pacific.
Wind that bends the trees of aggression and injustice.
But a true wind, marked also for its warmth.
An American wind.
You likie speechie?
Well, I suppose I should make the first cut here.
See? Nothing to it.
There you are.
See how easy that was?
Now you all go on and finish it.
- Not having any, Mr. President?
- Oh, no. No cake for me, John... birthday or no.
I have to remain fit and trim, vigorous and active.
After all, this Raisuli fellow is said to be over 50 and still a formidable brigand.
You may well make a formidable brigand yourself.
You've made a good start in life... and we all have high hopes for you when you grow up.
Now I shall have some of your cake.
Let them eat cake, huh, kid?
Not good for you, John.
Neither are those cigars.
I assure you, I can afford it.
Let me see that.
Take a note to the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company, New Haven.
Dear Sirs, I have received my improved model 1895 Winchester in.405 caliber.
As you and I both know, this is a very fine rifle.
However, once again, you have blundered... both in regard to the stock dimensions and the recoil pad.
How long will these mistakes be repeated?
I am the president of the United States.
I see no reason why an American president can't get satisfaction... from an American gun maker!
What must I do for a proper fitting?
Go to England?
- I should hope not.
- No, sir.
Why are you standing there like that, young man?
Speak up. This is a government, not a rest home.
- What is it?
- Your bear, sir.
- My bear? What bear?
- Your grizzly bear, sir.
Oh, the Smithsonian! Yes, you have the sketches. Thank you. Let's see.
Let's see these.
Oh, I'm sorry. That won't do.
No, that's... No, that's all wrong.
That's terrible. And that one...
You see, what's wrong here, young man, is the position.
You've made this fine specimen of a grizzly look like a hairy cow.
Now, would you like to be portrayed as a hairy cow if you were a grizzly bear?
Perhaps the president had a position in mind.
Certainly. There you are.
Now watch.
The American grizzly must always be portrayed in a fighting stance.
That's the sort of animal he is, upright, rampant, on his two hind feet.
His great forepaws extended like that.
Teeth bared, clawing, growling.
Understand?
Would you like to sketch that?
- Take a photograph.
- Good. Ready?
- Growl again, Father.
- You like that?
See that he gets a copy.
Now, where was I with Winchester?
"What must I do for a proper fitting?
Need I go to England?"
Oh, that's all right the way it is.
Send it out.
What must a man do, anyway, to get a proper-fitting rifle?
You can bet that Raisuli fellow's got a rifle that fits him.
Those people know the value of a good weapon.
- The rifle is the very soul of the Arab.
- Raisuli's a Berber, Mr. President.
Well, it goes double for Berbers.
- What sort of rifle does he use?
- I don't know, sir.
Send him a cablegram. Find out what kind of weapon the old bastard uses.
I think you're the best shot that's ever occupied the office, sir.
Oh, I don't know. Andrew Jackson back there was quite a shot.
Carried a brace of pistols all the time, you know.
Shot a fellow right off the porch, right out there.
Caned another one to death.
Admiral Chadwick, I presume.
I'm Vice Consul Richard Dreighton.
- Ray.
- Admiral. It's certainly good to see you.
Captain.
I must say, we've been awaiting your arrival with a great deal of anticipation... and I must say, not a little nervousness.
You see, gentlemen, what we have here... is a problem of enormous diplomatic complexity.
Now, the sultan of Morocco... Make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen.
The sultan of Morocco favors the German kaiser.
While the Bashaw, who is the real power here... is leaning toward the czar of Russia.
Now, in the middle of all this... an American woman is kidnapped by some desert pirate... and our president, of course, gentlemen, only wants to know... what kind of a rifle this brigand carries.
And he probably wants to build a canal too, for all I know.
- It's been done before, you know.
- Now, now, admiral.
Mr. Dreighton, see if the gentlemen care for a cigar. Would you, please?
You and I are both old men and we've seen these disasters come and go.
Now, our problem is to make this one go... and make it look good.
I must remind you, sir, that I was at Santiago Bay... when this president was running up San Juan Hill.
We'll have to do more than just look good this time.
Well, what did you have in mind, exactly?
Military intervention.
Yes. We are at this moment the most powerful naval force in Tangier harbor.
Well, I don't see what that has to do with anything.
We are a major power at this moment.
We carry the biggest stick.
Just how many men do you have, captain?
- Two reinforced rifle companies, sir.
- Well, you see, the sultan of Morocco... has three foreign regiments in Fez.
- That's right, sir. They're at Fez.
The Bashaw has only his household cavalry and guard here.
The power lies with the Bashaw.
Who is this boy?
Let him go on.
We'd be as useless chasing Raisuli as the redcoats on Bunker Hill.
And the sultan, if I'm correct in my assumption, will not meet his demands.
Yes, go on.
The sultan is not the power.
The real government is here.
That's right.
It would seem quite obvious, sir.
We must seize the government and make our own negotiations.
- Seize the government?
- At bayonet point!
I certainly would like to see that old son of a bitch at bayonet point.
But it's ridiculous.
It's outrageous. It's lunatic!
Yes, isn't it, though?
I should think Teddy would love it.
What about the French, the Germans, the British?
- Why, we're in the shadow of Gibraltar.
- Damn the legations!
You realize, of course, that if we fail in this in even the slightest way... we'll all be killed.
Yes. And the whole world will probably go to war.
Gentlemen, if we fail and are killed...
I certainly hope that the world does go to war.
World at war.
A world war.
Now that would be something to go out on.
William. Jennifer. Jennifer!
What is it, Mama? I was sleeping.
Dress quickly in the robes they gave you.
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Where are we going?
- We're going to make good an escape.
- An escape?
Right now? I was asleep.
You cannot wait for these things to occur at your convenience, Jennifer.
Now, I've bribed a man with jewels.
Come on. Get dressed. Hurry up.
Come along. Be quick about it!
The rifle, boy. Rifle!
- Yes, it is mine.
- Give me your rifle. Give it to me, yeah?
You'll get the rifle when we reach safety and not before. Now move ahead.
I'll take the rifle, Willy.
Be careful!
- Help!
- William!
William. William.
Mama!
William!
Get back!
William, get those loose horses there.
Quick.
Jennifer, go with William.
Mrs. Pedecaris, you're a great deal of trouble.
There is all that you need here.
Clothes of the finest silks, spiced meats, figs for you, when you wish to eat.
- Scented water to bathe in.
- But where are your guards?
Is it your intention to let us roam about freely?
You're the guests of the Raisuli... in the Raisuli's house.
I don't need guards.
My eyes are with you wherever you go.
Allah is with me.
No one can escape from God.
What will you do if they do not accept your terms?
What do you mean?
What will become of us, my children and myself?
I will play chess with you one more time and then return you to your house.
Alive?
Yes, of course.
Then you're just bluffing them.
You've never had the intention of killing us.
Raisuli does not kill women and children.
That's a silly question.
Why do you do this?
Because I am bluffing too.
Mrs. Pedecaris, you trouble me.
Ship, oars!
Present arms!
Good morning, sir.
The company is formed.
Sergeants, take your post.
Company... fix bayonets.
Move!
Right face!
Port arms!
Column left, march!
Column right, march!
Eyes... right!
I don't think the French and Germans are gonna like this.
Too early in the morning for rattling sabers.
Double-time... march!
Right on me.
Column left, now!
Column left, march!
Column left!
- Quick-time...
- Quick-time! march!
Third and fourth squads, column right, march.
First and second squads, column right, march.
Mark time... march!
Company... halt!
Hostiles to the left.
Left face!
Firing positions, move!
Aim!
Fire!
Prepare to charge the palace.
Charge!
Capt. Jerome,
United States Marine Corps.
And you are my prisoner, sir.
You are a very dangerous man, captain.
And your President Roosevelt is mad.
Yes, sir.
He's gone cowboy again.
Stand back.
Let me deal with him, or try.
Theodore, what are you doing?
Isn't that the czar?
A facsimile.
That's like shooting at your own brother.
Oh, Kermit's in the pits.
That's his idea of a little joke.
Obviously, you relish jokes in view of your approval of the Gummere report.
I try to go along with them, John.
I suppose a declaration of war would be a joke too?
You have to admit, it would be entertaining.
A barrel of laughs.
Have you any idea of the risk you're running?
Have you any idea of the territory
I'd be gaining?
Theodore.
You're dangerous.
You might even shoot somebody.
Accidentally, I mean.
John, I'd never shoot anyone accidentally. I need their votes.
Madness.
- Madness.
- Sir?
Utter madness.
Why are you closing your left eye?
You told us to shoot with both eyes open.
The light bothers me.
I can't see out of that eye anymore.
- What do you mean?
- I'm blind in my left eye.
- Since when?
- Saturday. Boxing.
Now don't say anything to Edith about it. Do you hear?
Maybe it'll go away.
And don't let anyone come up on my left side either.
Father, is Raisuli a real pirate?
Yes, Quentin, he's the last of the Barbary pirates.
Why do you say that?
Well, the world is fast outgrowing pirates, of that sort anyway.
Do you know any others?
Yes, J.P. Morgan.
He's the only other real pirate I know.
I hope you have him brought before you in chains.
- J.P. Morgan? I should hardly think so.
- No, have Raisuli brought before you.
I should like to see that.
Oh, I should like to see him too, but not in chains.
Let's have the Winchester, Alice.
You like him. Don't you, Father?
You like J.P. Morgan too. Don't you?
Of course I do, Alice.
But they're your enemies.
Well, sometimes one finds that your enemies... are a lot more admirable than your friends.
You pick the road to greatness, and you'll have that choice someday.
You come to realize that the road traveled by great men... is dark and lonely and lit only at intervals by other great men.
And sometimes they're your enemies.
But they're the only true luxury you have.
Yes, it's a dark and difficult road... and I do not look down upon anyone who has the good sense not to take it.
I was young and full of the sayings of young men.
I did not yet understand the ways of the prophet, the will of God.
I thought that men could oppose such will. I was very foolish.
A man can trust no one, yet often trusts women.
I trusted my brother and openly opposed the old sultan at Fez.
He let the Europeans give him money... and money is always followed by more Europeans.
My brother betrayed me, and I was sent to Mogador.
Mogador?
It is a dungeon on the edge of the sea.
I was sent there to die, but I was young and strong.
My brain was as agile as my fingers.
The confinement, speak of the confinement.
It was the intention of my brother to let the flies and the ants consume me.
But as the years passed... and the chains were replaced many times... it was always I who remained.
It was then that the guards saw that the Baraka was with me.
They arranged my escape.
I thanked them for the years of wisdom they had given me.
And I wandered into the mountains.
- Are you asleep?
- No, did I look like it?
No, but you made no noise, and others have fallen asleep while I speak.
The wandering, Raisuli.
Yeah. I wandered into the mountains.
I wished only to hear the voices of women... babbling about common things.
You permit me to say, the conversation of women does not interest me much.
But when one is in prison... one is inclined to have a different sense of disposition.
The Rifians found me.
I learned to read and to speak again.
The women aided me in this because of my lineage... but the men... they wanted to sell my head to the old sultan at Fez for rifles and gold.
There was but one thing to do, challenge Abdel Malak the Cruel.
We fought with swords on horseback.
And the Baraka was with me.
I cut off his arm.
And he wounded me... many times.
The tribesmen judged him, and every voice was against him.
And his eyes, which had witnessed much injustice... were burned out with heated copper coins.
And today he wanders the land a blind beggar.
Thus I became the true defender of the faithful... for the blood of the prophet runs in me, and I am but an instrument of his will.
Raisuli, lord of the RIF,
Salaam. Salaam.
I have never seen such fierce retainers.
Well, these are my immortals.
- They have...
- Put that down!
Let it be!
They are feared in hell... and their courage is such that golden thrones await them in paradise.
You are pleased, sherif?
I am pleased the Raisuli will be pleased.
The Bashaw offers this:
70,000 pieces of Spanish gold.
All foreign soldiers to be removed from the RIF... and the Raisuli and his followers are to be granted the freedom... to travel in the cities and marketplaces.
And last, all those held in the dungeons of Mogador... who swear fealty to Raisuli shall be placed under Raisuli's care.
This in return for the American woman and her children.
It is the word of the American sultan
Roosevelt, and his honor.
Even with treachery, such an offer is impressive.
The American Bashaw wished that the Raisuli act in haste... as the Europeans aren't pleased.
- You must take their offer!
Each day you keep us here... the Europeans use as an excuse to land more troops.
Everything that you have fought for is wasted!
They are using you, Raisuli!
- You are becoming a dupe to them.
- Do not call the Raisuli a dupe!
- I do not need the counsel of women.
- The American woman is true.
Every day more Germans travel to Fez.
They have guns that need wheels to carry them.
What is stopping you?
Can't you see?
It is no longer our concern.
The great powers want this land, and they will fight for it.
When they're done there'll be nothing... not your mountains, nor your palace, not pride, nor honor!
It is a wind so strong no tree can stand in it!
And where there are no trees, there is no shade from the sun.
And what is land without shade from the sun?
Desert.
The desert I know very well.
Mrs. Pedecaris, you speak like a Berber.
It must be the heat.
Why do you do this?
I do not ordinarily ask the counsel of any man... let alone the counsel of women.
You're not even one of my wives!
I should certainly say not.
I am not!
Children, come here.
We have no more business here.
Let these brigands decide what they shall do with us.
Mrs. Pedecaris, I have decided it would please me... to return you to President Roosevelt... because you're a lot of trouble!
Perhaps he will know what to do with you. It is not my fate to find out.
- Even you laugh at the Raisuli.
- This woman has taken the Raisuli.
You say such things in front of my men.
What has become of honor, respect?
Everything is changing, drifting away on the wind.
It's been a bad year.
The next one will probably be worse.
Where do we take them to get our gold?
I will take them. Do not risk your life.
What does my life matter?
I've nothing else to do.
Prepare to ride.
I do not understand this woman.
My entire education has been horses and the Koran.
What have I learned?
Look what I've become.
You are lord of the RIF.
Yes, and you would think
I would understand this woman.
Where exactly are we going?
To a small village east of Rabat at the foot of the mountains.
- It is good.
- What is good?
It is good to know where we are going.
What are they singing?
They are singing songs to God.
Why are you not singing?
I am the sultan. They do the singing.
That is ridiculous!
It is customary.
There is just one thing
I'd like to ask you.
Yes, what is it?
What is your first name?
- My first name?
- Yes, your Christian name.
I mean, what is the name that precedes all your other names?
My first name?
My Christian name?
I am Mulay Achmed Mohammed Raisuli the Magnificent, lord of the RIF.
Mulay. Mulay, that is a nice name.
Yes.
Mulay. I am Eden, Mulay.
Eden. Of course.
You need not go any further.
My retainers will bring back the gold.
What good is the word of the Roosevelt... if it is not met by the word of the Raisuli?
My brother knows this.
I do not fear treachery or fate.
I fear only God.
It is foolish and silly to talk as such.
These Europeans are not men.
They do not respect the laws of men.
Let me take the woman.
He is right.
It is no longer your concern.
No longer my concern?
It is I who took you.
It pleased me to do so.
It pleases me now to bring you back.
No longer my concern.
Sharif, bring your retainers.
The woman, Pedecaris, must not be endangered.
She must return to President Roosevelt.
If there is to be treachery, Allah will not leave my side, but you must.
Ride back, lead the mahalla, let there be jihad.
Let the swords run with the blood of the infidels.
We will all eat lamb in paradise.
Throw down your arms!
They obey only my will, and I am the Raisuli.
I am Mrs. Pedecaris. I do not want my family endangered any further.
Mrs. Pedecaris. Capt. Jerome,
U.S. Marine Corps.
- Help the children.
- Yes, ma'am.
Better take cover inside, ma'am.
Inside. Inside.
I am the sherif of Wazan.
These are my retainers.
They do not ride with this brigand.
Take him if you want!
What will they do to him?
That can't be our concern, ma'am.
We're quite outnumbered here.
Let's go inside.
I expect gold and rifles for his head.
I do not do this for a lackey's wages!
- Can't we get out of here?
- Not until it's light, ma'am.
I wouldn't trust these sorts in the dark.
Mother. Mother, aren't you going to do anything about the Raisuli?
William, the Raisuli is not our concern.
Aren't you gonna do anything?
Go to sleep, William.
Mother.
William!
William.
William, have you got your dagger?
Captain.
Captain, could you bring us some water, please?
Of course, ma'am.
Here we go.
For the boy first, captain, he has a fever.
Here, son, hold your head up.
There we go.
Oh, man!
Don't any of you move!
I shall cut this man's throat if you do not do as I say.
I am not fooling!
Now, drop those weapons!
- You could hurt somebody...
- Don't touch that!
William, get them. Jennifer, help him.
Get the pistols too.
William, give me the short one.
Get up.
Easy with that thing, ma'am.
I have shot grouse in Scotland and quail in North Carolina.
Believe me,
I know how to use this thing.
What are you doing?
What are you trying to get across?
President Roosevelt made an agreement with that man there... and President Roosevelt keeps agreements!
Now, there's no need to do this.
We're all Americans here.
- What exactly did you have in mind?
- I intend to free the Raisuli.
- Alone, I suppose.
- With my children.
Well, I wish you'd said that in the first place.
If you're gonna try it alone, with your children, you haven't got a chance.
What do you suggest I do then, captain?
I'd like to throw in with you.
And God help us.
Draw your weapons from the boy here.
Check for a full load.
My pistol, please.
Halt!
We want to see your prisoner.
I said we want to see your prisoner.
We want to see the Raisuli. President
Roosevelt negotiated in good faith!
What are you doing?
Let's go!
Hurry up! Cover us!
- Oh, my God!
- Mrs. Pedecaris.
The Baraka has not deserted me.
Cut me down quick, before it does.
The sword, woman! The sword!
Better.
Oh, my... Are you hurt?
Mrs. Pedecaris, you're a lot of trouble.
I'll see you again, Mrs. Pedecaris... when we're both like golden clouds on the wind.
There was nothing to worry about,
John.
All I have to do is go to
Oyster Bay for the week end... and the government of Morocco falls.
- By the way, how is Mrs. Pedecaris?
- In fine health, sir.
Quite a remarkable woman.
Capt. Jerome said during the fighting she displayed commendable courage.
That Jerome, I want him decorated with something.
Whatever you think is appropriate.
And Gummere and... What's his name?
Decorate the outfit, all of them.
I say, Theodore, you should thank your lucky stars.
Luck had nothing to do with it.
I had God on my side.
Maybe Allah.
- What's that?
- That's your bear. Your grizzly bear, sir.
First reports are we can get anything we want in Morocco, sir.
Coaling rights. We can put anybody on the throne.
Their camps were divided.
At this moment, Theodore is the most popular president in history.
- Take that cover off.
- What, sir?
Take the cover off.
I wanna see my bear.
- Later perhaps, Theodore.
- No, I want to see him now.
A good speech would be appropriate soon. Even the papers are cheering you.
There's no doubt about the outcome of the election.
Gentlemen, nothing in this world is certain, absolutely nothing.
The fate of the nation will be decided by the people in November.
And the fate of Morocco will be decided tomorrow by me.
Now, gentlemen, if you don't mind,
I'd just like to be alone with my bear.
I trust he was a Democrat.
To Theodore Roosevelt.
You are like the wind, and I like the lion.
You form the tempest.
The sand stings my eyes and the ground is parched.
I roar in defiance, but you do not hear.
But between us there is a difference.
I, like the lion, must remain in my place.
While you, like the wind, will never know yours.
Mulay Achmed Mohammed
El-Raisuli the Magnificent... lord of the RIF, sultan to the Berbers.
Great Raisuli, we have lost everything.
All is drifting on the wind, just as you said.
We have lost everything!
Sharif, is there not one thing in your life that was worth losing everything for?
Thank you for downloading!

"From Colligny in Antarctic France.
Lates news from Admiral Villegagnon.
The country is a barren desert
There are no houses nor any other amenities.
On the contrary.
The natives are barbarous savages, different from us, without any religion, or any knowledge or honesty or virtue, or what is right and unjust.
They are beasts with human faces.
To boot, our neighbors are Portuguese.
Unable to keep the country for themselves, they hardly tolerate our presence and hate us.
Therefore, I must show firmness and courage and I prepare my "family" for permanent work.
God's goodness will assist us in this enterprise.
We have set up camp on an island two leagues from the mainland to discourage any attempt to escape and to allow our troops to fulfill their task.
Wives will be admitted only with their husbands.
All opportunities of sin will thus be eliminated.
Even so, twenty-six mercenaries, tempted by their carnal lust, have conspired to kill me.
I have avoided any further danger by arming five of my servants.
We have arrested and imprisoned four of the principal mutineers
The others, scared, have hidden themselves.
On the following day,
I had one of them unchained so that he could plead his cause.
He broke loose and threw himself into the sea and was drowned."
Letter from Villegagnon to Calvin, dated 31st of March, 1557.
HOW TASTY WAS
MY LITTLE FRENCHMAN
Directed by
NELSON PEREIRA DOS SANTOS
"In Sâo Vicente lived the Portuguese, enemies of the French."
A Frenchman!
It will be a nice present for my uncle.
He hasn't tasted a Frenchman yet.
Let's take him to the Captain!
Your chief is our friend.
The Frenchman is a friend of our enemies.
You're christened.
You can't eat him.
My uncle is not christened.
He is our slave.
He will have to fight at our side until we get to Sâo Vicente.
This way! Beware!
Go see the Frenchman!
Wake up, Frenchie!
He is mine!
He is mine!
I am French!
French!... French!
He is French.
Say something!
Put the lamprey into scalding water, take its guts out...
Lay half a slice onto a bowl, spice it with oil.
Speak more!
He is French!
I think he is Portuguese.
I will kill him.
He is French.
He is mine!
That rabbit sure can run.
He is Portuguese.
He is French.
I am French!... French!
Speak!
Speak!
Let it rest for a while and take it to the fire...
Then lay a little bit of water, vinegar, and clove.
He is Portuguese.
He is mine!
You eat the other one.
I want to show him to the women.
"My Lord, if I must die a barbarous death... let it be at the hands of someone who knows you."
There comes Cunhambebe!
Our meal has walked to us.
Come and see what I brought you to eat.
Beautiful slave!
I want to die with my beard.
He doesn't weep like the other Portuguese.
You brought good slaves.
When do we start the war?
They are like tigers, naturally cruel... friends of War and enemies of peace."
Our sorcerers prophesied that we would capture a strong Portuguese.
There he is!
He is my slave.
At last I shall avenge my brother's death.
If he were French, he wouldn't kill Tupinambás.
The French have knives, hatchets, and combs, which they trade for wood and pepper.
He has nothing of the sort.
He is Portuguese, friend of the Tupiniquins, our enemies.
He'll die on the 8th moon.
"To the European friend, they deplore the bad luck of their ancestors who have not known such a virtuous people."
How good he is...
Our friend...
He comes from so far...
Just to see us...
How many dangers has he faced just to reach us!
Since our friend left, we have suffered much.
Many of us have died at the hands of our enemies.
How sad are our dead today!
They will not see the beautiful presents which our friend has brought us.
Among the dead,
Tapiruçu, my husband, claims for vengeance and suffers much.
Tapiruçu died by the fire of the Portuguese.
The prophecy of our sorcerers has come true since Cunhambebe has brought us a strong Portuguese to avenge Tapiruçu's death.
Damn Portuguese!
He says he is French.
He refuses to sleep with me.
I am sad.
That's enough!
At last you have come!
Here I am!
I brought you many trunks.
I want to see.
Later! We have time.
I am angry.
I want to see now.
Let me see your slave first.
Bring the Portuguese!
He says he is French?
I'll tell you if he is lying.
What did you bring me this time?
How many trunks?
Many... with cloth... combs, beads for your women, knives...
But this time I want much pepper and wood.
You mean you have come from so far just to get wood?
Where do you come from?
I was serving Villegagnon in Rio de Janeiro.
Please, tell these savages I am French.
I was forced to leave the fortress.
I was caught with some Portuguese.
Tell them I am French.
He is Portuguese all right.
Go and eat him!
You dog!
Swine!
Murderer!
Give it to me!
I have brought you a present.
Filthy dog!
Traitor!
That's no way to treat a Christian!
Let me explain.
They will eat me up!
Quiet! Those savages aren't easy to cope with.
All right!
They will kill you, but you have still eight months to live.
Until you die, you'll be very happy.
You may even escape.
Follow my advice.
That woman at your side is your wife.
It won't be difficult to be happy with her.
Meanwhile collect peppers and wood for me.
When I come back in a few months, we'll make a deal.
I'll take you along.
I'll give you money to start a new life.
"The French took with them every year thousands of quintals of Brazil wood."
Where...
...did you find... these beads?
Tapiruçu stole them from the Portuguese.
How many?
Won't you go look for wood?
The sun's up.
My husband Tapiruçu might get sore.
Let him rest in peace!
He can't see nothing.
Come! Let's go look for wood!
No! Today I want to stay... home.
Tell me about Mair...
...the great "caraiba"...
...your ancestor.
The one who taught us how to build a fire?
What else?
He taught the Tupinambás how to shave, how to make weapons to beat the enemy, to plant manioc and corn, to drink "cauim."
He taught us how to build houses.
We lived like animals.
He built a house and told us every family could have the same.
The house that the new God had built was stronger than our miserable huts.
Not a single drop of rain fell inside...
Where there were straw roofs and log walls, the new God built a small village with brick and stone-walled houses, with streets and squares, barracks for the warriors, and a castle for the council of chiefs.
The Tupinambás cannot forget their enemies till their very last day.
Tupiniquins enemies...
Portuguese enemies...
The men were jealous of the God and decided to kill him.
They forced him to jump through a fire.
He fell and was burned alive.
From his head came out thunders and tempests...
My husband!
Then he taught us how to cultivate the land to have big crops.
He worked alone with the women and the children since the men were busy hunting, fishing, and preparing for war.
Your old customs...
Look at the Portuguese!
He goes around only with women.
They will be my slaves, like you.
Once more!
The Portuguese!
Stop there, Portuguese!
I want gunpowder.
I've brought many boxes...
...axes, beads...
...and combs for your wives.
I want gunpowder... plenty of gunpowder.
I'll get it later on...
...from father.
He's on board a ship sailing from Rio.
I'm going to exchange my gifts with another one.
Let's make a deal.
As I see, you want beads.
But you're not allowed to come along this time.
I've tried to rescue you, but
Cunhambebe is not prepared.
You'd better wait a little while.
My goods may interest you.
In exchange for what?
Your flight?
It's impossible.
I want gunpowder.
Impossible.
Ten barrels, at worst.
Listen, no French captain...
...not even Sir Villegagnon will ever give gunpowder...
...to these barbarians.
It would be nonsense.
It's for me.
Don't you understand you can't have a thing of your own?
All you have belongs to Cunhambebe.
No trade with you.
Is it worth that much?
Look at her belly button.
Not bad!
The coin.
Let's bargain honestly.
Don't think you can run away.
The captain wants to leave at once.
A rival of mine.
Give me that.
It's mine, I found it!
Half and half.
No. We've made a deal.
Where are you going?
Come back.
Come on!
Let's see the big ship.
Come along.
You'll see...
...some nice things...
...my cousin gets...
...on board.
Come on!
Don't be afraid.
We'll be right back.
I want you to stay...
...by my side.
You are going to see...
...things you never saw.
There will be many beads for you...
Nobody owns such a stuff.
Only my cousin.
They'll come back.
I'm not sad.
What do you need all these necklaces for?
And all these combs?
The Frenchmen promised to bring me gunpowder...
...as well as necklaces, combs, and mirrors for you.
Will you be able to kill more Portuguese...
...and Tupiniquins with mirrors?
I've killed many of them...
...and I'll do even more with guns.
Our enemy is afraid.
Our brothers have been killed by Portuguese gunmen.
I want a revenge of my own.
A Tupinambá is valiant...
...and never forgives his enemy.
Like me!
You are going to die like an animal.
Wait! I can get some gunpowder.
I'll make some gunpowder with the help of Tupâ.
I'll make it out of sand and pepper...
...this evening...
...when Tupâ, the thunder God, will speak.
And tomorrow...
...tomorrow you'll have the gunpowder.
"They believe in the immortality of the soul, in thunder and devils.
It seems that this seed of religion grows
...and is not extinguished in them... despite the shadows in which they live."
So little?
Tupâ has spoken too much.
There should be more gunpowder.
I'll make more.
Is there any feast in the settlement?
The chiefs are praying for rain.
Go on, till Tupâ speaks.
Go on, don't stop!
I'll build my house near yours.
My uncle is waiting for me.
I'm going to visit him, but I'll be back to make some gunpowder...
...and to live here as a friend.
I'll leave on the first ship that arrives here.
First, you have to fight beside me.
It's time to attack our enemies.
You work the guns.
We'll attack the Tupiniquins with all our might.
I'll send for my relatives...
...all over around.
Weapons and flour are ready.
Only helpful dreams...
...are missing.
Try to dream of our enemies' burnt flesh...
...and ask the chief and your wife for advice.
We shall win!
"The natives believe that the soul...
...of those who conquered their enemies...
...will go to pleasent places."
Chief!
Our ancestors agree.
We want to revenge the outrage of our enemies.
There they are.
We're going to kill and capture a large quantity of them.
I dreamt of my father looking for me.
Following the war?
Yes, after helping Cunhambebe to defeat his enemies.
But I came back.
We shall win!
The sea will watch the end of the Tupiniquins.
Cunhambebe will know how to beat them!
"In this country no
Governor, no Bishop...
...or other authority could please God, Our Lord...
...for evil is much impregnated in the customs."
Father Nóbrega - Missionary
My slave is ready.
We'll eat him this moon.
And I'll get a further name.
My cousin Ipiraguaçu will receive this arm.
That one to Mbitatá.
The neck belongs to Seboipebe.
Are you going to die as a brave... or will you weep like the Portuguese?
Why did you come here?
I came to make gunpowder... for my master.
It will not rain before the feast.
Tupâ does not need the rain to speak.
Are you going to weep?
What about you?
Yes, I'll feel unhappy.
But then you'll eat me.
What must I do during the feast?
Show yourself a brave.
You have to run...
...and then all of us shall run after you.
Run quickly... as a warrior does.
You can't escape...
...but you'll be respected.
You'll be led back...
...and the women will paint your head.
You have to dance for a while tied to a rope.
Cunhambebe will bring the "iverapema".
You'll be allowed to throw fruits and stones...
...on those who are going to eat you.
Then Cunhambebe will say:
"I'm here to kill you."
"Because your people... have killed...
...many of ours."
You must answer:
"When I die...
...my friends will come...
...to avenge me."
Say it again!
My friends will come to avenge me.
No... "When I die..."
"...my friends will come to avenge me."
When I die, my friend will come to avenge me.
Then Cunhambebe will lift the "iverapema"... and you must do like that... like that.
But it can't help...
...because two warriors will be holding the rope.
It will beat you just upon your head.
And then?
Women will pour hot water on your body...
...both your arms and legs...
...will be cut... and everybody will eat a piece.
My little neck!
My little neck!
Leech!
My little neck!
What a delicious meat!
I am here to kill you...
...because your people have killed...
...many of ours...
...and eaten them.
Talk!
"When I die...
...my friends will come... to avenge me.
No one of yours... will remain upon this land."
"I fought on the sea, so that no
Tupiniquin remained alive.
Laid along the shore...
...the dead covered almost a league."
Mem de Sá. Governor
General of Brazil, 1557.
THE END
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS
SOUND SO MANY TRUMPETS?
I'M NOT JEHOVAH.
WHY CAN'T A PRINCE
COME HOME WITHOUT A FUSS?
PRESUMABLY BECAUSE
HE IS A PRINCE, SIR.
OTHER PEOPLE CAN SNEAK IN
THE BACK WAY UNANNOUNCED,
WHICH IS HOW
IT SHOULD BE.
WHAT ARE YOU
SMILING AT?
OH, WAS
I SMILING, SIR?
JUST THE SUDDEN WARMTH
CRACKING MY FACE.
A PRINCE'S LOT IS
NOTHING MORE THAN A BORE.
YOUR FACE CRACKS
RATHER EASILY, DOESN'T IT?
NOW, YOU MARK
MY WORDS,
BEFORE YOU
CAN COUNT TO 10,
THROUGH THAT DOOR,
WITH THE ODIOUS PUNCTUALITY
OF OUR NEIGHBOR'S
MUCH VAUNTED,
RECENTLY INVENTED, HIDEOUSLY
IRRITATING CUCKOO CLOCK,
WILL COME OUR DEAR
AND LOYAL SUBJECT,
THE EVER-UNCTUOUS
LORD HIGH CHAMBERLAIN.
Man: 7!
HE'S IMPROVING.
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
HE'S GOING TO ACHIEVE
THE ELUSIVE
10-MINUTE MILE.
HA HA HA HA!
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
AH, WELCOME HOME.
WELCOME HOME,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
MY LORD HIGH CHAMBERLAIN,
WHAT AN UNEXPECTED
PLEASURE.
I AM COMMANDED BY
HIS MAJESTY THE KING,
YOUR FATHER,
AND HER MAJESTY
THE QUEEN, YOUR MOTHER--
YES, YES, NOW,
DON'T TIRE YOURSELF,
I AM ACQUAINTED
WITH THEM.
HOW ARE MY
DOTING PARENTS?
THEIR MAJESTIES ARE NATURALLY
MOST ANXIOUS TO HEAR
SUCH GLAD TIDINGS
I FEEL SURE YOU BEAR
CONCERNING YOUR RECENT
ABSENCE FROM THE COURT.
NAMELY, THE MATTER
OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
AND BETROTHAL TO THE PRINCESS
SELINA OF CAROLSFELD.
INDEED, IN ANTICIPATION
OF SUCH WONDERFUL NEWS,
HIS MAJESTY THE KING
HAS DECIDED TO MAKE YOU
A KNIGHT GRAND CROSS
OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ORDER
OF SAINT DAVID THE MARTYR.
WHICH IS USUALLY
AWARDED POSTHUMOUSLY.
A SUITABLE HONOR,
AS IT HAPPENS,
FOR THE MATTER OF MY BETROTHAL
IS VERY STATUS QUO.
I DID NOT FIND THE LADY OF
YOUR CHOICE TO BE MY CHOICE.
OH, BUT, SIR--
WE ARE RETURNED...
AS WE DEPARTED.
THE KING I'M SURE,
AND INDEED MY DEAR MAMA
WILL SHARE
YOUR NOTICEABLE GRIEF.
Chamberlain: INDEED, SIR,
THE WHOLE COURT WILL BE GRIEVED.
WELL, SO BE IT.
ANY SIMPLE PEASANT IS
AFFORDED THE ABILITY
IN LOVE...
TO WIN OR LOSE
WHILE I OF THE NOBILITY
AM ROBBED OF THE FACILITY
TO CHOOSE
ANY SERF OR SERVANT
CAN BY NATURAL SELECTION
ELECT HIMSELF A MATE
IF SHE'S AMENABLE
BUT DUE TO MY HIGH BREEDING,
I'M CONTINUALLY ACCEDING
TO DEMANDS
I FIND INCREASINGLY
UNTENABLE
ALL I ASK, AND IT'S A
SIMPLE ENOUGH REQUEST--
WELL, FOLLOW ME,
BY ALL MEANS, FOLLOW ME.
I WISH TO KNOW,
I DEMAND TO KNOW...
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?
WHY CAN'T I LIVE
TWO ROLES?
WHY CAN'T ONE OF ME PERFORM
ALL THE CLOYING AMENITIES TI
WHILE THE OTHER ME,
TWIN BROTHER ME
BE A FREE AND HAPPY SOUL?</>
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?
SPLIT MYSELF RIGHT IN HALF
THEN I COULD SATISFY
AND MOLLIFY
AND PACIFY AND QUALIFY
WHILE THE OTHER ME
WOULD HAVE
A HELL OF
A HEALTHY LAUGH, HA? '11
THE CUSTOM OF ROYALTY
IN REFERRING TO ONESELF
IS TO NATURALLY EMPLOY
THE ROYAL "WE“
"WE ARE VERY HAPPY" SI
Y, “WE ARE VERY SAD“ “I
“WE ARE BORED
AND SUFFER FROM ENNUI"
FOR A ROYAL PRINCE,
THERE'S NO SUCH WORD AS “ME"
IT'S ALWAYS "WE“
SO, RIGHTFULLY, I
SHOULD BE TWO on THREE
DON'T YOU AGREE?
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
PERHAPS NOT.
SO, I ASK MYSELF...
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?
WHY CAN'T I PLAY
TWO PARTS?
WHY CAN'T ONE OF ME ENDURE
THE APPALLING FORMALITIES
WHILE THE OTHER ME,
TWIN BROTHER ME
HAVE A FREE
AND HAPPY HEART?
IF I COULD BE
TWO PEOPLE
LIFE WOULD NOT
PASS ME BY
I'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO PICK AND CHOOSE
I'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO WIN OR LOSE
AND MAYBE ONE OF US
WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO LIVE...
BEFORE WE DIE!
DIE? WHO'S DIED?
AH! AT LAST!
OUR DEAR SON.
WE ARE... WE ARE...
WE'RE WHAT?
DELIGHTED.
YES, DELIGHTED
TO SEE YOU RETURN.
OH!
AH, YES, I HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.
Prince: FATHER...
Chamberlain:
YOUR MAJESTY--
KNEEL, SIR.
FATHER.
I DO NOT WISH" IT WOULD
BE MOST INAPPROPRIATE...
YOUR MAJESTY, HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS HAS RETURNED--
OF COURSE HE'S RETURNED! YOU
GET MORE SENILE EVERY DAY.
I HAVE RETURNED,
FATHER--
NOW YOU' RE
CATCHING IT.
EMPTY-HANDED.
KNEEL, SIR.
FATHER, THIS IS
MOST EMIBARRASSING.
I COMMAND YOU
TO KNEEL, SIR!
I DON'T DESERVE IT.
I HAVEN'T EARNED IT.
NOBODY EARNS THIS.
IT'S GIVEN BECAUSE I AM
THE KING AND I LIKE IT.
WHERE'S MY SWORD?
AH! IT'S FAR
TOO HEAVY.
YOU KNOW, I WAS BORN WITH THE
CURSE OF THE WEAK WRISTS.
OH, I DO SO LOVE
A CEREMONY.
AH, THAT'S BETTER.
I DUB THEE--
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
SHOULDN'T THERE BE
SOMETHING BEFORE THAT?
YES, INDEED, SIRE.
I HAVE IT HERE.
YOUR MAJESTY--FATHER,
DO WE--MUST I-- us, or COURSE,
YOU MUST. AHEM!
“LET IT BE KNOWN
TO ALL HERE PRESENT
“THAT BY OUR COMMAND
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS,
“THE PRINCE
EDWARD CHARLES
"ALBERT GEORGE JAMES
RICHARD AUGUSTUS PHILIP
HAS RECEIVED
OUR GRACIOUS FAVOR.“
ER... WHO WROTE THIS?
YOU DID, SIRE.
AH, YES, WELL,
IT'S MAGNIFICENT STUFF.
WELL WORTH
PAYING ATTENTION TO.
“FROM THIS DAY HENCEFORTH
SHALL BE ENTITLED
"TO BE KNOWN AS
A KNIGHT GRAND CROSS
OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ORDER OF
SAINT DAVID THE BLESSED MARTYR. "
THERE'S... SOMEBODY
IN THE ROOM!
VERY FINE. NOW I KISS
YOU ON BOTH CHEEKS.
THAT'S THE PART
I LIKE BEST.
I SOMETIMES GIVE MEDALS
TO A WHOLE REGIMENT.
GOOD. VERY
TOUCHING CEREMONY.
Chamberlain:
MOST TOUCHING, SIRE.
SYCOPHANT!
DON'T ALWAYS HAVE
TO AGREE, YOU KNOW.
CONGRATULATIONS,
DEAR COUSIN.
OH, LORD!
WHO LET HIM IN?
CONGRATULATIONS !
I HEARD ALL THE TRUMPETS.
NOW, DON'T YOU START.
OH! A LITTLE
PREMATURE, AM I?
I SAY, HAVE I DROPPED THE
TINIEST OF SOCIAL BRICKETTES?
I MEAN, I WAS BEING
QUITE SINCERE.
WELL, YOU KNOW, AS
SINCERE AS I EVER AM.
OH, no!
WHO IS IT? HAS THERE BEEN
AN UPRISING?
NO, YOUR MAJESTY. IT'S
JUST THE DUKE OF MONTAGUE.
IS HE STILL ALIVE?
I THOUGHT WE BURIED HIM.
FATHER, EVER SINCE
I ENTERED THIS ROOM,
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU THAT
WHAT YOU EXPECTED OF ME
DID NOT TAKE PLACE.
MY THROW, I THINK.
No, IT'S NOT.
YOU'RE CHEATING AGAIN.
KINGS NEVER CHEAT. THEY
ADAPT TO CIRCUMSTANCES,
BUT THEY NEVER CHEAT.
IF I MAY, SIR,
BY roux LEAVE,
THIS THING
IS CHOKING ME.
YOU SEE HOW
I'M PLACED?
ACCUSED IN FRONT OF THE
COURT BY MY OWN WIFE.
FATHER,
THIS IS SERIOUS.
OF COURSE,
IT' S SERIOUS.
I SHALL PROBABLY
CONCEDE THE GAME.
IT'S A ROYAL PREROGATIVE
TO BE UNSPORTING.
NEVER CONCEDE.
I THROW.
BLACK 5 !
THE MATCH, FATHER, WAS OF
YOUR MAKING NOT OF MINE.
EVEN So,
AS A DUTIFUL SON,
I JOURNEYED FAR
BEYOND OUR BORDERS
TO PAY MY RESPECTS
TO THE LADY AND...
SEE FOR MYSELF.
AND SHE WAS FAIR,
WAS SHE NOT?
INDEED, SIR. PERHAPS
PALE RATHER THAN FAIR.
A SICKLY LADY, SIR,
GIVEN TO MUCH SWOONING
AND... AND VAPORS.
ALL LADIES SWOON. THEY KNOW
IT'S EXPECTED OF THEM.
SOME SWOON
MORE THAN OTHERS, SIR,
AND SWOONING TO EXCESS IS NOT
A QUALITY I GREATLY ADMIRE.
SHE REFUSED YOU? IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
No, FATHER,
SHE COULD NOT REFUSE ME
BECAUSE I DID NOT OFFER.
YOU PERHAPS PLACED
TOO MUCH TRUST
IN THE PORTRAIT PAINTERS
OF CAROLSFELD.
THE LIKENESS
WAS No LIKENESS.
INDEED, SINCE YOU FORCE ME
TO THE DISCOURTESY,
THE LADY WAS BALD, SIR.
HER GOLDEN TRESSES FALSE!
HER MOUTH CRABBED WITH AGE, SIR,
AND DEVOID OF TEETH!
IN SHORT, SIR, SHE LEFT
MUCH TO BE DESIRED.
EXTRAORDINARY '.
FATHER,
IT'S A SMALL THING
AND DOUBTLESS
VERY IRRITATING TO YOU
BUT WHEN I MARRY,
AS NEEDS I MUST ONE DAY,
IT WILL BE FOR THE
CONVENIENCE OF LOVE,
RATHER THAN THE CONVENIENCE
OF... CONVENIENCE.
LOVE?
DID HE SAY LOVE?
HA HA!
HOW ABSURD.
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO DO
WITH GETTING MARRIED?
WHY SHOULD LOVE ENTER
INTO IT AT ALL?
LOVE CAN MAKE YOU QUITE EMOTIONALLY
HARRIED WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED
IT'S PEDANTIC
AND ROMANTIC FOLDEROL
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE
PRINCESS SUSAN
PRINCESS KAREN
PRINCESS KATE
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE
LOVE WILL HAVE TO WAIT
I DISAGREE.
YOU DISAGREE?
HOW CAN YOU
DISAGREE, DEAR?
LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT US.
Us, HA HA!
LOOK AT us.
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO
DO WITH BEING MARRIED?
BEING MARRIED IS
A PROBLEM ALL ITS OWN
LOVE IS HIGHLY OVERRATED AND
MAKES MARRIAGE COMPLICATED
WHEN THE BED IS
ELEVATED TO THE THRONE
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE
PICK THE PROPER PRINCESS
PRIMIED TO PROPAGATE
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE
LOVE WILL HAVE TO WAIT
THERE IS MANY
AN ELIGIBLE MAIDEN
OF GOOD FAMILY
WITH TITLE OF HER OWN
WHO WOULD COME TO US
BOUNTIFULLY BELADEN
WITH AN ARMY THAT COULD
FORTIFY OUR THRONE
UNCLE!
I COULDN'T HAVE SAID
THAT BETTER MYSELF.
WELL, I COULD,
AND IN FACT,
I THINK I WILL.
WHAT HAS MARRIAGE GOT TO DO
WITH BEING HAPPY?
BEING MARRIED CAN'T COMPARE
WITH BEING ROYAL
BEING ROYAL YOU ENGENDER
EVERY LUXURY AND SPLENDOR
WHILE A MARRIAGE
CAN GET OVERRIPE AND SPOIL
'FIND A MATE, DEAR COUSIN,
SET THE DATE
WHY PROCRASTINATE
UH-UH!
T AND STAY THE HAND OF FATE? T
'FIND A MATE, DEAR COUSIN,
SET THE DATE
HAPPINESS
CAN ALWAYS WAIT
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
GET HIM OUT.
OH, HAVE I MADE
A LITTLE FAUX PAS?
I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF.
THERE, YOU SEE, THAT'S THE PRICE
THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO PAY
UNLESS YOU NAME
THE DAY.
LISTEN, LEND AN EAR.
I SAY AGAIN...
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO DO
WITH GETTING MARRIED?
Queen: WHAT HAS BREAD
GOT TO DO WITH WEDDING CAKE?
WE ARE BORED WITH YOUR
DEFIANCE OF CONNUBIAL ALLIANCE
FOR A LINE OF ROYAL GIANTS
IS AT STAKE
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE
WE ARE GROWING OLD
AND TIME IS GROWING LATE
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE
IT'S YOUR DUTY TO THE STATE
NOT TO STAY A CELIBATE
FIND A MATE
FIND A MATE.
FIND A MATE.
FIND A MATE.
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO DO
WITH GETTING MARRIED?
WE ARE NOT PREPARED
TO SAY.
Woman: OH, WHAT A RELIEF
THAT IS OVER
AND DONE WITH.
HELP ME, MY DARLINGS. MY
FINGERS ARE POSITIVELY NUMB.
Girl: MAMA, DIDN'T
YOU THINK THE VICAR WAS--
Woman: GIRLS,
GIRLS, GIRLS.
CAN YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT SQUABBLING?
BLACK WAS NEVER
MY COLOR.
Girl :
So UNBECOMING.
ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE'S
So YOUNG AND PRETTY.
AND WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE GOING, CHILD?
TO MY ROOM,
STEPMOTHER.
YOUR ROOM?
Girls : HER ROOM!
Stepmother: ALL THE ROOMS
IN THIS HOUSE ARE MINE NOW.
YOUR FATHER,
M'! LATE HUSBAND,
SADLY MISSED BY
US ALL,
IS DEAD, CHILD.
DEAD AND BURIED
BENEATH THE SNOW
IN THE SAME GRAVE
AS YOUR DEAR MOTHER.
THAT IS A DOUBLE MISFORTUNE
FOR YOU.
AND NOW YOU MUST START
A NEW LIFE.
YOUR FATHER, AS A TOKEN OF
HIS GREAT LOVE FOR ME,
SAW FIT TO MAKE A WILL
PLACING YOU IN MY CARE
AND PROTECTION.
MY FATHER
NEVER LOVED YOU.
YOU TRICKED HIM.
HOW DARE YOU, MADAM!
YOU TRICKED HIM!
WELL...
WELL IF I DID,
HE DID NOT LIVE
TO RUE THE DAY, DID HE?
AND NOW YOU CAN CURB
YOUR TONGUE;
CULTIVATE HUMILITY,
KNOW YOUR PRESENT PLACE.
I HATE YOU.
I HATE YOU ALL.
NOW, LISTEN TO ME, GIRL,
AND HEAR ME WELL!
BLOOD IS THICKER
THAN A WIDOWS TEARS,
AND GOD KNOWS I HAVE SHED
ENOUGH OF THOSE.
I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS
OF MY OWN TO SUPPORT,
WHICH SITUATION
HAS FORCED ME
TO MAKE CERTAIN ECONOMIES
IN THE HOUSEHOLD.
IS THAT NOT SO, GIRLS?
YES, MAMA.
CERTAIN DRASTIC
ECONOMIES, MAMA.
EXACTLY.
BUT BEING A WOMAN
OF PRINCIPLE,
I SHALL HONOR YOUR
FATHER'S LAST WISHES
AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE
A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD
BELOW STAIRS!
AND DO NOT THINK YOU WILL
FIND SYMPATHY WITH THE STAFF.
THE STAFF
HAVE BEEN DISMISSED.
YOU ARE NOW THE STAFF.
TO TAKE ORDERS
INSTEAD OF GIVING THEM.
MOSTLY FROM US.
NEVER.
OH, YES.
YOU WILL COOK
AND YOU WILL CARRY.
YOU WILL FETCH
AND YOU WILL MEND.
YOUR FATHER'S WILL
ALLOWS AND THE LAW UPHOLDS.
So, TAKE YOUR PICK,
EITHER ACCEPT
YOUR LOT
OR Go TO
THE ORPHANAGE.
Stepsister: THEY TELL ME,
CINDERELLA,

THE RATS.

BURYING A HUSBAND

AND SADLY FOR ME,
I HAVE NOW BURIED TWO.
Girls: POOR MAMA!

YOU WILL NOT BE NEEDING
IT DOWN THERE.
HURRY, GIRL, HURRY!
AND DO NOT KEEP US
WAITING FOR THE SOUP.
COME ALONG, MY DOVES, WE
MUST REARRANGE THE ROOMS.
Stepsister: OH, MAMA,
MAY I HAVE CINDERELLA'S ROOM?
Second stepsister: No, MAMA,
YOU PROMISED ME FIRST PICK.
SHE ALWAYS HAS EVERYTHING--
MY DARLINGS...
EVERYTHING WILL BE FAIRLY
DIVIDED. NOW, COME ALONG.
I'M THE ELDEST, AND I
SHOULD HAVE FIRST CHOICE.
SHE MAY BE THE ELDEST,
BUT I'M MAMA'S FAVORITE.
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT.
OH, MAMA, sun's so BEASTLY!
Stepmother: LITTLE STEPS,
GIRLS, LITTLE STEPS.

King: SO, EVEN ALLOWING FOR
ERRORS IN THE CARTOGRAPHER'S ART,
WE ARE SMALL IN COMPARISON
WITH OUR NEIGHBORS.
THOUGH GREAT IN, AHH,
WHAT'S THE WORD?
ER, TRADITION?
TRADITIOH, YES. GREAT
IN TRADITION AND SPIRIT,
IN FACT, WE ARE SMALL.
HEAR, HEAR.
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN!
NOW, YOU'RE ALL AWARE
OF THE PROBLEMS
OF MY SON'S RELUCTANCE TO
HAVE A PERFECTLY GOOD WIFE
CHOSEN FOR HIM.
THIS GENERATION HAS
No RESPECT AT ALL.
I MEAN, I WAS MARRIED OFF
BEFORE I WAS 14!
CAROLSFELD - -WHERE'S THAT?
AH, YOU SEE, THE SIZE OF IT,
SEE THE SIZE OF IT. PERFECT.
NOW, WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?
WITH RESPECT,
YOUR MAJESTY,
I HAVE PREPARED
A SMALL PAPER.
WHAT I AM SEEKING
IS A PROPER BALANCE,
WEIGHING
WHAT WE SACK
AGAINST WHAT
WE HAVE TO OFFER.
OH, FOR GOODNESS SAKES, STOP TALKING
IN THOSE BORING, DIPLOMATIC RIDDLES.
SPEAK THE KING'S
EUPHRANIAN, MAN!
FORGIVE ME, YOUR MAJESTY.
I HAD IN MIND A CELEBRATION.
King: WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO CELEBRATE?
A MARRIAGE, SIRE.
GETTING MARRIED AGAIN?
HMM. FINALLY
GOT RID OF HER, EH?
WELL, NOT MY MARRIAGE, SIRE.
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS,
THE PRINCE EDWARD'S.
WELL, WE'D ALL LIKE
TO CELEBRATE THAT.
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
SOMETIMES I THINK I'M
SURROUNDED BY A LOT OF IDIOTS.
HERE WE ARE, HEDGED
IN BY HOSTILE FORCES,
AND ALL YOU CAN THINK OF IS
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN THOUGHT OF.
SIRE, THIS TIME,
I HAVE A NEW IDEA,
AN IDEA THAT THE PRINCE HIMSELF
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RESIST!
WELL, MAKE SURE
THAT SHE'S GOT TEETH.
HE'S GOT AN OBSESSION
ABOUT THEM HAVING TEETH.
I THOUGHT, A BALL!
A BALL?
A GREAT BALL !
THE GREATEST BALL THAT
HAS EVER BEEN KNOWN, SIRE.
AND TO IT, WE WILL INVITE EVERY
ELIGIBLE PRINCESS IN EUROPE,
AND EVEN BEYOND,
YOUR MAJESTY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT IDEA?
I REMEMBER MY FIRST BALL.
YES, WELL, WE DON'T WANT TO Go
INTO THE REALMS OE FANTASY.
WHAT ELSE?
I HAVE PREPARED A LIST, your: MAJESTY,
AND I THOUGHT WE COULD
MAKE SUCH PREPARATIONS
AS WOULD DAZZLE
OUR ENEMIES AND DMDE THEM,
FOR PROTOCOL WOULD NOT
ALLOW THEM TO MAKE WAR
WHILE THEY ARE GUESTS
IN OUR MIDST.
AND I REMAIN CONVINCED
THAT THE PRINCE, YOUR SON,
WILL DO HIS DUTY.
INDEED, FACE TO FACE IN THE
PRESENCE OF THE ENTIRE COURT
HE COULD HARDLY FAIL
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.
General: THE OCCASION,
THE MUSIC, THE CANDLELIGHT,
THE SWIRLING DRESSES,
THE PERFUME,
THE VERY ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE!
PUT HIM ON
THE RETIREMENT LIST.
I SHALL MAKE
A ROYAL DECISION!
TAKING THIS IDEA
AND IMPROVING ON IT,
WE MUST PLAN EVERY DETAIL.
NOBLESSE OBLIGE!
Chamberlain:
QUITE SO, YOUR MAJESTY.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT DIPLOMACY.
PROTOCOL!
YES, WE MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT
THE RULES AND
REGULATIONS WE RESPECT
MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT
ELSE THE KINGDOM
WILL BE WRECKED
WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT
CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED
AND PROTOCOLIGORICALLY
CORRECT
SIRE! PLEASE, SIRE.
WHEN ITS ARMY IS
BATTERED AND BROKEN
AND BACK TO ITS
BORDERS IT CRAWLS
TO WHAT CLINGS
A TOTTERING KINGDOM
IF NOT TO ITS PROTOCOLS?
AND WHEN THE TREASURY'S
TAPPED OF ITS TREASURES
ARE THE TAPESTRIES
STRIPPED FROM THE WALLS?
No, THE COURT CARRIES ON
WITH ITS PLEASURES
INQUISITIONS
AND BANQUETS AND BALLS
All: BUT THEY MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
WE RESPECT
T MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT
ELSE THE KINGDOM
WILL BE WRECKED
WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT
CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED
AND PROTOCOLIGORICALLY
CORRECT
HO, HO,
WELL-DONE, SIRE.
PRECEDENT!
WE NEED A BOOK THAT WILL
GIVE US CHAPTER AND VERSE.
IN THE LIBRARY--
IT'LL BE IN THE LIBRARY.
I BELIEVE WE ARE ALREADY WITHIN
THE LIBRARY, YOUR MAJESTY.
WELL, OF COURSE,
OF COURSE.
I KNEW THAT !
WHAT VOLUME
DO YOU SUGGEST?
THERE IS ONLY ONE,
YOUR MAJESTY, THE BIBLE.
BIBLE?! WELL, LET'S KEEP
RELIGION OUT OF IT.
NO, SIRE. I SHOULD
SAY IN THIS CASE,
THE BIBLE IS FORMS
AND ADDRESSES
FOR ROYAL OCCASIONS
B'! DE LYON.
AH.
NOW THEN,
LET ME SEE, SIRE...
ABDICATIONS,
DISMISSAL OF MINISTERS,
GARDEN PARTIES,
INVESTITURES...
JUDICIAL BEHEADINGS"
YES, SKIP ALL THAT.
YOUR MAJESTY, QUESTIONS
OF PRECEDENT PERTAINING
TO THE SEATING
OF CROWNED HEADS
IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.
AHH! WE SHOULD REHEARSE IT!
UH, YOU CAN BE
THE PRINCESS ESMERELDA,
EVER WILLING TO SERVE,
YOUR MAJESTY.
AND YOU THE DUCHESS
OF RAMBOUILLET,
AND YOU THE DAUGHTER OF
THE EMPEROR OF BRATISLAVA,
AND, UH... OH, THE REST OF YOU CAN
SORT IT OUT AMONGST YOURSELVES.
WHAT AN INSPIRED IDEA,
YOUR MAJESTY.
IF THE DAUGHTER OF
THE DUCHESS OF SNARDEN
WERE TO BE SEATED BY
THE COUNTESS OF SNEAD
FOR THIS BREACH
OF DECORUM TO SNARDEN
THE INVASION
OF SNEAD WOULD PROCEED QI
AND SEAT THE HEIRESS
TO THE BARONY OF NEUBURG
BY THE SIDE OF HER
HATED COUSIN GWENN
OH, HOW QUICKLY
THE ARMIES OF NEUBURG
WOULD DEPLOY
TO DESTROY US AGAIN
All: SO WE MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
WE RESPECT
T MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT
ELSE THE KINGDOM
WILL BE WRECKED
WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT

So WE MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS
WE RESPECT
T MUST BE TREATED CIRCUMSPECT

WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT

AND PROTOCOLIGORICALLY

PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT
WELL, NOW!
WERE YOU EXPECTING ME?
NO. I WASN'T
EXPECTING ANYBODY.
FUNNY. YOU SHOULD
HAVE FELT SOMETHING.
I'M LOSING MY TOUCH.
COULD I COME IN AND REST
BY YOUR FIRE, PLEASE?
I'VE BEEN TRAVELING
A LONG WAY.
WELL... I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO
TALK TO ANYBODY OR SEE ANYBODY,
BUT...
YES, OF COURSE.
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO SHARE MY FIRE...
SUCH AS IT IS,
BUT I'D BE OBLIGED
IF YOU DIDN'T STAY TOO LONG.
PLEASE EXCUSE ME
IF I CARRY ON WORKING,
BUT I HAVE TO FINISH
THESE, AND I'M VERY SLOW.
YES! WELL, THERE ARE MORE WAYS
THAN ONE OF PEELING POTATOES.
THE FIRE SEEMS
TO HAVE CHEERED UP.
I COULD WARM YOU A LITTLE
BROTH IF YOU LIKE.
No, THANK YOU.
BUT THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHT.
LIVE DOWN HERE on YOUR own, no YOU?
I DO NOW.
YES.
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY
THEY WON'T CHANGE AGAIN.
I GET AROUND QUITE A BIT,
YOU KNOW.
MUST BE NICE TO TRAVEL.
YES AND No.
I SOMETIMES WISH
I COULD SETTLE IN ONE PLACE,
BUT THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH TIME.
I'D LIKE SOMEWHERE COZY,
WITH A DOG TO KEEP ME COMPANY.
I EXPECT YOUR DOG IS
A GREAT COMFORT TO YOU.
MY DOG?
I HAVEN'T GOT A DOG.
ISN'T HE YOURS?
WHERE DID HE COME FROM?
HE CAME IN WHEN I CAME IN.
OH! OH, WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO WITH HIM?
WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU KEEP HIM?
HE'LL TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF.
HE'S AN OLD HAND AT THAT.
OHH!
HE SEEMS TO LIKE YOU.
OH, I LOVE HIM!
I'M JUST SO AFRAID OF WHAT
MY STEPMOTHER WILL SAY.
Stepmother: CINDERELLA!
THERE SHE IS,
AND I HAVEN'T FINISHED!
I'VE GOT TO HIDE YOU.
WELL, I'LL BE OFF.
I'VE SEEN WHAT I WANT TO SEE.
YOU JUST TAKE CARE OF HIM.
Stepmother: CINDERELLA!
I KNOW! I'LL HIDE
YOU UNDER HERE.
PROMISE NOT
TO MAKE A SOUND.
HAVE YOU BEEN
STRUCK DUMB, GIRL?
OH!
OH!
ANSWER ME WHEN I CALL.
YOU KNOW I HATE HAVING
TO RAISE M'! VOICE.
NOW, I HOPE YOU HAVE
BEEN HARD AT WORK. I...
I SEE.
WELL, UH...
UH, I SEE.
I SEE I SHALL HAVE TO GIVE
YOU MORE TO DO NEXT TIME.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THAT?
King: I WILL NOT HAVE
MY AUTHORITY FLOUTED
IN THIS FASHION.
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CUSTOM
FOR THE HEIR TO THE THRONE
TO TAKE A WIFE IN GOOD TIME.
AND YOU SHOW A STRANGE RELUCTANCE
TO COMPLY WITH TRADITION.
FATHER,
I EMPHATICALLY DISAGREE.
AND I TOTALLY REFUSE TO TAKE PART
IN SUCH AN EMBARRASSING CHARADE.
BUT I'VE DECREED IT!
THEN YOU MUST
UNDECREE IT.
IMPOSSIBLE !
YOU TALK TO HIM.
DEAREST BOY--
OH, MOTHER,
IT'S NO USE TRYING
TO GET ROUND ME
THAT WAY.
THE VERY IDEA
OF GIVING A BALL
AND INVITING A SELECTION
OF TITLED WALLFLOWERS
TO VIE FOR MY HAND
IS UTTERLY REPULSIVE!
DEGRADING
TO ALL CONCERNED.
IN MY DAY,
I NEVER HAD THE CHOICE!
NOT THAT I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN
ANY DIFFERENTLY, OF COURSE.
YOU TAKE A DECISION
WITHOUT CONSULTING ME.
WELL I AM YOUR FATHER,
AND I AM THE KING!
IT'S LIKE SOME
SORDID BEAUTY CONTEST
WITH ME
AS THE GRAND PRIZE.
SINCE YOU WON'T GO TO MECCA,
MECCA MUST COME TO YOU!
Queen: YOU HAVE TO GET
MARRIED SOMEDAY, DEAR.
BUT NOT IN THIS WAY.
WELL, IT SEEMS PERFECTLY
REASONABLE TO ME.
WE'VE INVITED EVERY ELIGIBLE
PRINCESS IN THE ALMANAC.
AND IT'S A QUESTION OF DUTY!
FATHER, I HAVE NEVER QUESTIONED
THAT IT IS MY BOUNDEN DUTY
TO TAKE A WIFE AND ENSURE
THE ROYAL SUCCESSION.
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN I HAVE TO BE
PARTY TO AND JUDGE A CATTLE SHOW!
WHOEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING?
CAP-CATTLE SHOW!
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
WHERE EVERY MAIDEN'S
BOUND TO LAUGH AT ME
THE ROYAL
FATTED CALF
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
THOUGH I'M THE ONE
WHO DOES THE CHOOSING
I'M THE ONE
WHO DOES THE LOSING
IT'S NAUSEATING,
NAUSEATING!
CAN'T YOU
JUST IMAGINE IT?
HOPE SPRINGS IN ALL
SHORT, FAT, OR TALL
AS THEY PRIMP
AND PREEN AND PRAY
THAT THIS WILL BE
THEIR LUCKY DAY
THERE IS NO AFFAIR
OF WHICH I'M AWARE
MORE GALLING TO BEAR
THAN A BRIDE-FINDING BALL
Montague:
I JUST HEARD THE NEWS!
King: OH,
WHO LET HIM IN?
IS IT TRUE, DEAR UNCLE?
THE TATTLE IS THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO INVITE A WHOLE NURSERY
OF NUBILE DELICACIES
TO A BALL.
SOME OTHER TIME, NEPHEW.
WE'RE BUSY NOW.
OH, BUT YOU CAN'T
KEEP ME IN SUSPENSE.
YOU JUST CAN'T, UNCLE.
I MEAN, I REALIZE THAT
I WON'T HAVE FIRST PICK,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME
BECAUSE I'M NOT PROUD.
I'M JUST DESPERATE.
WE'RE ALL DESPERATE!
SO IT'S TRUE, THEN!
OH, HOW EXCITING!
NOW, I MUST DECIDE
WHAT TO WEAR.
HIGH HEELS, I THINK, TO
GIVE ME ADDED STATURE.
THE MOMENT YOU'VE
MADE YOUR CHOICE,
I SHALL UNLEASH MYSELF.
I'VE ALREADY MADE
MY CHOICE, COUSIN.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR
PICK OF THE LOT.
OH, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
YOU CAN'T BE SUCH
A SPOILSPORT! I MEAN...
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
WHERE LUSCIOUS LOVELIES
FROM EACH LAND
WILL VIE TO WIN
THE ROYAL HAND
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI
WITH FRILLS ON TRESSES,
PARTY DRESSES
EVERY MAIDEN EFFERVESCES
GIVING HER BEST
GVING HER ALL
DANCING, GLANCING,
LAUGHING, TEASING
WHIRLING, SWIRLING
TOUCHING, SQUEEZING
THERE'S NO AFFAIR
TO EVER COMPARE
OR THRILL OR ENTHRALL
LIKE A BRIDE-FINDING BALL
Chamberlain: YOUR MAJESTY.
King: WELL, WHAT IS IT?
I BRING GRAVE TIDINGS.
CAROLSFELD HAS MOBILIZED.
THERE IS TALK OF WAR.
WAR?!
WAR?!
WAR.
WAR.
AS YOUR MAJESTY'S
SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE,
IT IS MY SOLEMN DUTY TO ADVISE YOU
THAT THE SITUATION IS CRITICAL.
THE NEWS THAT HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS SAW FIT TO DECLINE
THE HAND OF THE
PRINCESS SELINA IN MARRIAGE,
WAS ILL-RECEIVED.
TRUE.
TRUE.
EDWARD, M'! sou...
I BESEECH YOU NOT AS A
FATHER BUT AS YOUR MONARCH.
RECONSIDER BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE.
PUT ASIDE YOUR
PERSONAL FEELINGS.
THE WHOLE COUNTRY LOOKS TO
YOU TO FORM AN ALLIANCE
THROUGH
THE MARRIAGE BED.
AND DO AS I DID WHEN
I TOOK YOUR MOTHER.
I CLOSED MY EYES AND
THOUGHT OF EUPHRANIA.
Chamberlain: BRATISLAVA!
WILDENSTEIN!
NEUBURG !
OH!
OH!
AAH!
UHH!
King: HOW MANY
DOES THAT MAKE?
WELL, YOUR MAJESTY, OF THE
COURIERS WHO RETURNED,
6 HAVE REPORTED
ACCEPTANCES.
IN ADDITIOH, THERE
WERE 5 REFUSALS.
ONE OF THEM COUCHED IN
THE MOST OBSCENE TERMS.
TWO OF THOSE
INVITED WERE DEAD,
AND THE REMAINING 3
COULD NOT BE TRACED.
THAT MAKES 6 OUT OF 16.
WELL, I THINK THAT'S
A FAIR AVERAGE, DON'T YOU?
YES, INDEED, SIRE.
PERHAPS NOT QUITE
THE BREADTH OF CHOICE
WE AT FIRST ENVISAGED.
WELL, INVITE ALL LOCAL
NOBILITY AS WELL.
WE DON'T WANT
THE PLACE HALF EMPTY.
WE CAN ALWAYS RAISE
THE TAXES TO PAY FOR IT.
IN FACT, I'LL INVENT A NEW TAX,
A TAX ON SNOBBERY.
THEY'LL ALL PAY THAT.
BRILLIANT, YOUR MAJESTY!
BRILLIANT!
DON'T OVER DO IT.
DON'T OVER DO IT.
YOU'LL BE PAYING IT, TOO.
Stepmother: GIRLS! GIRLS!
ISOBELLA! PALATINE!
Isobella and Palatine:
RIGHT HERE, MAMA!
COME QUICKLY!
WHAT IS IT, MAMA?
WONDERFUL NEWS.
WE HAVE RECEIVED A ROYAL
INVITATION TO A BALL
IN HONOR OF HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS, THE PRINCE!
OH, MAMA, BUT--
NOW, NOW, NOW,
CAREFUL, CAREFUL.
YOU MIGHT TEAR IT,
AND I WANT
TO HAVE IT FRAMED.
OH, I THINK
IT'S SO EXCITING,
I SHALL HAVE THE VAPORS!
HOW SHALL I HAVE
MY HAIR?
OH, WHAT SHALL I WEAR?
THERE IS WORK
TO BE DONE.
WE HAVE NOT
A MOMENT TO LOSE.
WHAT CAN WE WEAR?!
WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE
SOMETHING NEW.
YES. I MEAN, NONE OF MY
THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
LET US GO AND SEE.
OH! CAN YOU NEVER DO
A JOB PROPERLY, GIRL?
LOOK AT ALL THAT DIRTY WATER.
YOU HAD BETTER DO
THE WHOLE STAIRCASE AGAIN!
COME, GIRLS!
MAMA I THINK PALATINE
SHOULD WEAR A BROWN DRESS.
Palatine:
YOU SPITEFUL CREATURE!
YOU SHOULD WEAR GREEN
TO MATCH YOUR COMPLEXION.
Isobella: OH, MAMA!
BUT THE PRESTIGE, YOUR ROYAL
HIGHNESS, THE PRESTIGE!
IT WILL PUT
EUPHRANIA ON THE MAP.
UH, PIN THERE, IDIOT.
NOT THERE, THERE.
EXCUSE ME,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
FINE, FINE, FINE.
ENOUGH'S ENOUGH.
I'M DELIGHTED.
YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL.
NOW LEAVE US, PLEASE.
OH, JOHN!
WHAT HAVE
I LET MYSELF IN FOR?
A LITTLE MORE
POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE.
AND WHO KNOWS?
PERHAPS THERE WILL BE ONE TO
WHOM YOU CAN GIVE YOUR HEART.
WILL YOU DANCE
WITH YOUR LADY CAROLINE?
ALAS, NOT DONE, SIR.
OH, YES, HOW STUPID OF ME.
I WAS FORGETTING.
NOT IN 20 YEARS!
WE'RE SOLD OUT!
MY CHOICEST BROCADES!
Stepmother: SOLD OUT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU RIDICULOUS MAN?
HOW CAN YOU BE SOLD OUT
WHEN WE HAVE NOT
PURCHASED ANYTHING?
THE BALL, GRACIOUS LADY.
I'D SCARCELY OPENED ME DOORS THIS
MORNING WHEN THEY DESCENDED!
WHO? WHO DESCENDED?
EVERYBODY, MI LADY !
THEY CAME LIKE
THE HERON TO THE POOL,
TAKING EVERYTHING I HAD.
I HAVE NEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING.
YOU, MY GOOD MAN, SHOULD
LEARN TO DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN RIFFRAFF AND PEOPLE
OF CONSEQUENCE, LIKE US.
WHAT SHALL WE DO?
Stepmother:
COACHMAN, DRIVE US HOME.
GIRLS, DO STOP PULLING
THOSE DREADFUL FACES.
I'M IN A BAD ENOUGH
MOOD AS IT IS.
IDIOT!
Palatine: OH, MAMA,
SHE'S SO BEASTLY TO ME!
CINDERELLA!
CINDERELLA! WHERE IS
THAT WRETCHED GIRL?
WHY DO YOU NOT COME
WHEN I CALL YOU?
COME OVER HERE. I HAVE
A JOB FOR YOU TO DO.
TAKE THESE, UNPICK THEM, AND MAKE 3
SPLENDID NEW DRESSES OUT OF THEM.
OH, MAMA, YOU'RE SO CLEVER.
MAKE SURE THEY FIT
TO PERFECTION.
NOW START IMMEDIATELY.
THERE'S NOT A MOMENT
TO LOSE.
BE SURE YOUR HANDS ARE CLEAN
BEFORE YOU START SEWING.
AND WE'RE TO LOOK
AS PRETTY AS POSSIBLE.
AH, WELL, AS PRETTY
AS WE ARE!
WE MUST ALL BE
UTTERLY SPLENDID.
SO RUN ALONG, CHILD.
START AT ONCE!
YES...
UTTERLY... SPLENDID!
BUT ALREADY,
HIS HEART WAS--
OH, HENRIETTA, no STOP GRUMBLING.
HIS HEART WAS
BURNING WITH... LOVE
AS IF IT HAD BEEN LAID
ON RED HOT GOALS!
YOU LIKE THAT?
So DO I.
SIT DOWN, DEAR.
DON'T DO THAT.
AT THIS POINT, SCHEHERAZADE
SAW THE APPROACH OF MORNING
AND FELL SILENT.
AS WELL SHE MIGHT.
NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
SET YOUR FRIENDS OFF.
I SUPPOSE YOU WANT FEEDING.
NO REST, NO PEACE.
WELL... SEE IF YOU LIKE THIS.
YOU'LL FALL.
HANSEL, GRETEL...
IS THAT
THE WRONG WAY ROUND?
WHO'S THAT?
OH, IT'S YOU, IS IT?
OH, DON'T WIPE
YOUR PAWS, WILL YOU!
I'VE GOT NOBODY TO HELP
ME CLEAN, YOU KNOW.
I HAVE TO DO ALL MYSELF.
DO YOU REALIZE THAT TIRESOME SCHEHERAZADE
IS BARELY HALFWAY THROUGH HER 1,001 NIGHTS?
I HAVE TO THINK OF ANOTHER
496 TALES BEFORE SHE'S SAFE.
AND M'! DIARY IS CHOCK-A-BLOCK.
LOOK! WEDNESDAY, A SEA JOURNEY TO
TAKE CARE OF A LITTLE MERMAID.
FRIDAY... OH, THE UGLY
DUCKLING'S DUE TO HATCH.
WELL, I HAVE TO BE
BACK FOR THAT.
OH, DO BE QUIET, HENRIETTA.
I CAN'T THINK!
NOW, WHAT'S THAT?
AH! A NEW KEY CUT
FOR PANDORA' S BOX.
WELL, IT'S ALL VERY WELL
FOR HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN
TO SAY HIS LIFE
IS A FAIRY STORY.
MINE ISN'T.
NOTHING! ONE LONG SLOG!
I CAN DO ALL MANNER OF THINGS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE,
BUT NEVER ANYTHING FOR MYSELF.
WATCH! YOU'D LIKE A BONE.
SIMPLE. THERE YOU ARE.
LET ME TRY IT FOR MYSELF.
WOULD I LIKE A CUP OF TEA?
YES, I WOULD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NOW WATCH THIS.
KETTLE, BOIL.
SEE? DISASTER.
NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO CINDERELLA?
HOW FUNNY.
I WAS JUST WISHING--
YES. I KNOW.
DO YOU MIND IF I MAKE
A VERY RUDE COMMENT?
THESE ARE HOPELESS.
THEY'RE WORSE
THAN HOPELESS.
I'VE RUINED THEM.
I'M GOING TO GET
INTO SUCH TROUBLE.
NOW, WE DON'T WANT
ANY OF THAT.
DRY YOUR TEARS
AND HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT.
HMM. YOU LOOK
HALF-STARVED AND WORN OUT.
I'M AFRAID THERE ISN'T
ANYTHING TO EAT.
I WAS TOO BUSY DOING
THOSE TO COOK ANYTHING.
WHAT'S THAT, THEN?
WHERE DID THAT
COME FROM?
AND WHERE DID
YOU COME FROM?
I DON' T UNDERSTAND.
NO. WELL, VERY FEW PEOPLE DO.
YOU'RE NOT MEANT
TO UNDERSTAND IT.
YOU'RE MEANT
TO ACCEPT IT GRACIOUSLY.
NOW, LOOK.
I'M A VERY BUSY WOMAN,
AND I SOMETIMES--
SOMETIMES LACK TACT.
THE FIRST THING YOU MUST LEARN IN
LIFE IS NEVER TO GO BY APPEARANCES.
THINGS ARE NEVER QUITE
WHAT YOU THINK THEY ARE.
DO EAT UP; THAT'S
ONE OF MY BEST RECIPES.
TAKE ME, FOR EXAMPLE.
I'M NOT WHAT I SEEM.
MIND YOU, I DON'T
DRESS THE PART
AND FOR VERY GOOD REASON.
HUMAN NATURE--OH, WELL,
WE WON'T GO INTO WHAT
I THINK OF HUMAN NATURE,
BUT IF I WERE TO Go ABOUT MY
BUSINESS ALL SPARKLE AND GLITTER,
QUITE APART
FROM LOOKING ABSURD"
BECAUSE DESPITE WHAT THEY WRITE
IN THOSE STORYBOOKS FOR CHILDREN,
IT'S A MOST UNSUITABLE
COSTUME FOR A GROWN WOMAN--
I SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO SORT OUT
THE WORTHY FROM THE UNWORTHY.
DON' T YOU AGREE?
I'M NOT SURE I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I'M A... FAIRY GODMOTHER.
HAVE BEEN ALL MY LIFE.
AND PLEASE DON'T ASK
HOW I GOT INTO IT,
BECAUSE IT'S A LONG STORY.
HIGHLY IMPROBABLE...
AND I SOMETIMES WISH
WE'D NEVER BEEN INVENTED.
ARE THERE MANY OF YOU?
NOT ENOUGH TO GO ROUND,
JUDGING BY THE AMOUNT
OF WORK I HAVE TO DO.
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
DELICIOUS.
IT'S THE SAUCE, YOU KNOW.
THAT OLD WIZARD MICHELIN
GAVE ME THE SECRET
IN RETURN FOR 3 OF MY MAGIC
KNIVES AND FORKS. WHERE WAS I?
YES! WELL, I HAVE
TO PUT PEOPLE TO THE TEST.
NOW, YOU PASSED THE TEST.
THOSE-THAT UNHOLY TRIO UPSTAIRS
I SIMPLY DIDN'T BOTHER WITH.
NOT WORTH THE EFFORT.
HOWEVER, TO WORK.
BEST THAT YOU CAN DO
IS GET A GOOD NIGHTS REST.
NO'! YOU.
I DIDN'T INCLUDE YOU.
YOU'VE GOT WORK TO DO.
WM.
AH. LET ME CONCENTRATE.
WHAT ARE THEY WEARING
IN PARIS THESE DAYS?
I CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH FASHION.
WELL, HAVE YOU GOT
ANY IDEAS?
OH, CONCENTRATE.
CONCENTRATE.
Stepmother: OF COURSE,
IT IS NOT WHAT I AM USED TO,
BUT I MUST SAY, YOU HAVE MADE A
REASONABLE JOB OF STITCHING THIS.
Palatine: I'M MAM'SA FAVORITE,
AND SHE PROMISED ME FIRST.
GIRLS, IT IS
TIME TO LEAVE!
WE MUST NOT KEEP
THE PRINCE WAITING.
MAMA, I'VE JUST BEEN
TELLING PALATINE
THAT SHE'S NOT TO
FEEL JEALOUS
IF THE PRINCE ASKS
ME TO DANCE FIRST.
OH, MAMA!
SHH.
CINDERELLA,
STRAIGHTEN THAT HEM.
Palatine: HOW DO
I LOOK, MAMA?
DON'T I LOOK SUPERB?
YOU BOTH LOOK
RAVISHING.
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR YOUR
POOR MAMA TO OUTSHINE YOU.
WELL!
COME, LET US DEPART.
CLEAR UP THE MESS IN MY
BEDROOM, CINDERELLA.
I DO NOT WANT TO COME HOME
AND FIND IT ALL UNTIDY.
Cinderella:
HAVE A NICE TIME.
Stepmother: YOU MAY
DEPEND ON THAT!
Palatine: OH, MAMA,
WE LOOK WONDERFUL.
Isabella: WELL, I DO.
Stepmother:
COME, GIRLS.
Man: YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,
MY LORDS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
HER SERENE HIGHNESS
THE PRINCESS MARIA OF TUSCANY.
THE GRAND DUCHESS SOFIA
ELIZABETH OF DIETRICHSTEIN.
HER IMPERIAL HIGHNESS
PRINCESS ALEXANDRE.
OH, WHY NOT?
I'LL JUST MAKE TIME.
YES. YES,
JUST AS I THOUGHT.
SITTING ALL ALONE FEELING
SORRY FOR OURSELVES, ARE WE?
WELL, THAT'S
UNDERSTANDABLE, I SUPPOSE,
THOUGH I NEVER CARED MUCH FOR
THESE ROYAL OCCASIONS MYSELF--
TOO FORMAL, AND NOT
ENOUGH TO EAT OR DRINK.
STILL, I DARESAY IN YOUR HEART
OF HEARTS YOU'D LIKE TO GO.
GO?
ME Go TO THE BALL?
WELL, OF COURSE.
THAT WHAT YOU WERE
WISHING, ISN'T IT?
NOT WISHING,
EXACTLY,
BUT THINKING WHAT
IT MUST BE LIKE.
SAME THING.
NOW, LISTEN. I HAVEN'T GOT
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME,
BECAUSE I'M SIMPLY RUN
OFF MY FEET THESE DAYS--
WHAT A
MISERABLE FIRE.
YOU SHALL Go
TO THE BALL.
I JUST HOPE I HAVEN'T
STRETCHED EVERYTHING TOO FAR
AND THAT I CAN
MAKE IT WORK.
MY POWERS ARE NOT
UNLIMITED, YOU KNOW.
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW.
OH, I HAVE TO
SHARE THEM OUT.
NOW, LET ME THINK.
YES, I CAN BORROW
A BIT UNTIL MIDNIGHT.
RIGHT.
NOW.
YOU !
OUTSIDE.
HEY, I SHALL NEED YOU,
So OFF YOU Go.
OH, AND YOU.
TAKE THEM WITH YOU, DOG,
AND SEE IF YOU CAN ROUND UP
A FROG OR A LIZARD.
NOW, THEN, I MUST DO
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU.
IT DOESN'T
ALWAYS WORK, THIS,
BUT THEN,
I HAVE BEEN LUCKY.
OH, DEAR.
OH, DEAR!
MOST UNSUITABLE
FOR A BALL.
YES.
YES, IT IS.
WELL, YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO Go AS YOU ARE.
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL!
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!
HOW DO YOU DO IT?
WELL, THAT'S
A TRADE SECRET,
BUT IT HELPS
IF YOU DREAM.
IF YOU DREAM...
SUDDENLY
'SUDDENLY IT HAPPENS
AND THE DREAM COMES TRUE
WONDERFULLY
BEAUTIFULLY IT HAPPENS
AND YOUR WORLD IS NEW
X MAGICALLY ﬂ
YOU'RE HOLDING
THE GOLDEN PRIZE
MYSTICALLY
YOUR CASTLES
BEGIN TO RISE
SUDDENLY
DIZZILY YOU'RE SPINNING
WITH THE THRILL OF LIFE
SUDDENLY

THEY'LL RECOGNIZE ME.
No ONE WILL RECOGNIZE
YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE.

BUT HOW
SHALL I BEHAVE?
I'M DRESSED LIKE
A PRINCESS.
OH, JUST BE
YOURSELF.
AND FOR TONIGHT,
YOU ARE A PRINCESS--
THE PRINCESS
INCOGNITA.
BUT I MUST
WARN YOU--
AND TAKE HEED, FOR IT
IS A SOLEMN WARNING--
THE MAGIC I HAVE CONJURED HERE
TONIGHT IS BORROWED MAGIC.
ON THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT,
YOU MUST RETURN IT.
OTHERWISE, EVERYTHING
I HAVE TRANSFORMED
WILL CHANGE BACK TO
ITS ORIGINAL STATE.

AHEM. CHARMING
LITTLE THING.
DOESN'T SPEAK
A WORD OF EUPHRANIAN.
JOHN?
John: MA'AM?
TAKE ME
ON THE FLOOR.
YES. YES, or COURSE.
HOW VERY
INTERESTING.
DO YOU LIKE TO DANCE?
EXCELLENT TEETH.
HA HA!
YOUR MAJESTIES,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,
MY LORDS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
HER HIGHNESS
THE PRINCESS... INCOGNITA.
WHO IS SHE?
WHO CAN SHE BE?
I'VE No IDEA,
YOUR MAJESTY.
SHE'S NOT
ON MY LIST.
YOUR LIST,
YOUR LIST.
YOUR LIST. FIND
OUT, MAN. FIND OUT.
YES, SIR.
I DIDN'T QUITE
CATCH THE NAME.
NO, MOTHER.
NONE OF US DID.
MOST IRREGULAR.
PLAY ON.
PLAY ON.
I THINK...
I THINK I SHOULD EXPLAIN WHY
I'M HERE, YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
MY EYES GIVE ME
ENOUGH REASONS.
MY NAME IS EDWARD,
AND IT IS FOR ME TO
EXPLAIN MYSELF TO YOU,
EXPLAIN WHY
I SUBJECTED YOU
TO THIS
RIDICULOUS CHARADE.
I'M SURE I SEEM TO YOU
THE MASTER OF MY FATE,
BUT UNTIL
THIS MOMENT,
I'VE BEEN A PRISONER
TRAPPED BY MY BIRTHRIGHT.
TRAPPED?
YES.
IT WAS NEVER MY INCLINATION
TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS.
WHAT I MEAN IS...
AND I'M NOT SAYING
IT VERY WELL...
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED
THAT MARRIAGE...
SHOULD BEGIN WITH LOVE.
I'M SURE YOU AGREE.
I HAVE NEVER GIVEN
THE MATTER MUCH THOUGHT.
I'M AMAZED YOU EVEN ACCEPTED
THE INVITATION TO THE BALL.
YES.
I WAS A LITTLE
AMAZED MYSELF.
DIDN'T YOU
THINK IT ODD?
I SUPPOSE I DID.
BUT... YOU STILL CAME.
WHY?
MUST YOU
ASK THAT?
YES, I MUST.
I HAD HEARD
MUCH OF YOU.
GOOD OR BAD?
OH, NOTHING
BUT GOOD.
I CAN'T THINK HOW.
IF I WERE YOU, I'D HAVE
BELIEVED THE WORST.
YOU SEE,
I WAS EXPECTING--
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.
BUT WHATEVER
HAPPENS AFTERWARDS,
I SHALL ALWAYS REMEMBER
THIS MOMENT.
AND YOU MUST TAKE MY PRESENT
HAPPINESS TO MAKE YOU HAPPIER.
TAKE IT...
WITH ALL MY HEART,
FOR I GIVE IT WITH
ALL MY HEART.
THERE'S A SECRET KINGDOM
ALL MY OWN
WITH No CASTLES AND No
VASSALS AND NO THRONE
JUST TWO SUBJECTS,
YOU AND ME
IN MY PRIVATE
MONARCHY
WHERE THE KING IS LOVE
AND LOVE ALONE
IN THAT SECRET
KINGDOM THAT YOU SEE
SHOULD THE MAKE-BELIEVE
BECOME REALITY
WITH No SCEPTER
IN YOUR HAND
No DOMINION
TO COMMAND
WOULD YOU BE CONTENT
WITH ONLY ME?
WHAT IS A SONG
THAT'S NEVER SUNG?
WHAT IS A HEART THAT'S NEVER
THRILLED TO BE YOUNG?
WHAT IS A DREAM THAT
CAN'T COME TRUE?
WHAT IS MY LIFE TO ME
WITHOUT M'! LOVE FOR YOU?
IF THAT SECRET KINGDOM'S
OURS TO SHARE
I COULD NEVER WISH FOR
MORE, FOR YOU'D BE THERE
JUST TWO SUBJECTS,
YOU AND ME
IN OUR PRIVATE
MONARCHY
ALL ALONE TOGETHER
WE WOULD LOVE FOREVER
IN OUR SECRET KINGDOM
FAR AWAY SOMEWHERE
AHEM.
YOUR ROYAL
HIGHNESS?
YES? WHAT IS IT?
HIS MAJESTY
REQUESTS AN AUDIENCE
WITH THE PRINCESS
INCOGNITA.
Edward: PLEASE
TELL MY FATHER
WE'LL BE HAPPY TO
GRANT HIS REQUEST.
YOU FRIGHTENED HER,
YOU FOOL!
WAIT !
COME BACK!
COME BACK.
RAINBOWS RACED
AROUND THE ROOM

MY WORLD BECAME
A MAGIC BLENDING
OF DREAMS
AND HOPES AND LOVE
WHEN HE DANCED

ONLY A FANTASY
AND I KNOW TONIGHT IS
ALL THERE WILL EVER BE
DANCING
IN HIS ARMS FOREVER

WILL NEVER BE FREE

Stepmother:
CINDERELLA!
WHERE IS
THAT WRETCHED GIRL?
CINDERELLA!
YES, STEPMOTHER?
THERE YOU ARE.
WHY DO YOU NOT COME
WHEN I CALL?
I WANT A WEAK
INFUSION OF TEA.
MY HEAD IS FIT
FOR CRACKING.
GOOD MORNING,
MAMA.
MORNING, MAMA.
BRING
THE BREAKFAST.
IMMEDIATELY,
CINDERELLA.
I WASN'T ABLE
TO SLEEP.
OH, OH, THE EXCITEMENT
OF LAST NIGHT!
NOT ON THE BED,
MY PRECIOUS.
Palatine: YOU WOULD
HAVE BEEN AMAZED.
YOUR STEPSISTERS
WERE A TRIUMPH.
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE LATE ARRIVAL
OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PRINCESS,
I FEEL SURE THE PRINCE WOULD HAVE MADE
HIS CHOICE BETWEEN MY TWO ANGELS.
WHAT PRINCESS WAS THAT?
NOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW.
HE SEEMED QUITE
TAKEN WITH HER,
BUT THEN, MEN ALWAYS
Go FOR THE OBVIOUS.
OH, YES.
I MEAN, SHE WAS NOT
THAT PRETTY...
STRIKING, PERHAPS.
Isobella: DON'T
FORGET M'! BREAKFAST.
Stepmother:
BREAKFAST.
THINK, MAMA--
WE WERE ACTUALLY
THERE AT THE CASTLE.
WHERE YOU BELONG,
MY DEAR.
I WONDER WHAT THE
PRINCE IS DOING TODAY?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE PRINCE
IS GOING TO DO TODAY.
THE PRINCE IS GOING TO EXERCISE
HIS ROYAL PREROGATIVE FOR ONCE.
King: LEAVE US.
No, STAY. I WANT YOU
TO HEAR THIS.
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF BEING
TREATED LIKE SOME VILLAGE IDIOT!
King: I'M GLAD YOU
STAYED TO HEAR THAT.
AFTER ALL, HE IS THE
HEIR TO THE THRONE.
FATHER, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
TREATS ME LIKE AN IDIOT.
YOU ARRANGE A
BRIDE-FINDING BALL.
AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT,
I FALL IN WITH YOUR PLANS.
I PLAY MY PART.
I GREET, I'M POLITE,
I DANCE WITH, I FLATTER,
I CONCEAL MY BOREDOM FROM HALF A DOZEN
TWITTERING MAIDENS OF BLUE BLOOD.
IN SHORT, I FULFILL MY SIDE
OF THE BARGAIN.
TRUE. I CAN 'T
FAULT HIM THERE.
AND THEN, BY SOME MIRACLE, I
FIND THE LADY OF MY CHOICE,
AND WHAT HAPPENS?
YOU FRIGHTEN HER AWAY!
A SEARCH HAS BEEN MADE,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
IS BEING MADE
EVEN AS WE SPEAK.
OUR POLICE--
OUR POLICE, FATHER, COULDN'T
FIND A MISSING HAYSTACK,
LET ALONE A NEEDLE.
HOW COULD SHE DISAPPEAR
WITHOUT A TRACE?
DO WE NOT HAVE FRONTIERS,
CUSTOMS POSTS, GUARDS?
WE HAVE CUSTOMS,
OF COURSE.
VALUABLE SOURCE
OF REVENUE.
AND MOST PEOPLE SAY THAT OUR
POLICEMEN ARE WONDERFUL.
THIS IS APPARENTLY THE ONLY
CLUE WE HAVE, AND I FOUND IT.
IT'S REMARKABLY DAINTY.
EXACTLY.
IT'S UNIQUE...
LIKE ITS VANISHED OWNER.
THEREFORE, WE MUST USE IT.
WHOEVER FITS THE SLIPPER
MUST FIT THE BILL!
HE'S RIGHT.
HE'S RIGHT!
WHOEVER FITS THIS SLIPPER
SHALL MARRY MY SON!
YOUR MAJESTY, YOU HAVE
SOLVED THE PROBLEM.
QUITE So.
NOW, WE MUST ACT--
UH, YOU MUST ACT.
UM, THIS SLIPPER
MUST BE TAKEN
TO EVERY STRANGER
OF NOTE IN THE LAND.
THIS REALLY IS--
IT REALLY IS
VERY DAINTY.
UM, THE YOUNG LADY
ARRIVED INCOGNITA
BUT MUST OBVIOUSLY BE
OF SOME CONSEQUENCE.
SHE CANNOT REMAIN
UNKNOWN FOREVER.
A PROCLAMATION
IS REQUIRED, SIRE.
YES. DRAFT IT
IMMEDIATELY.
BE IT KNOWN THAT IT IS
OUR ROYAL WILL
TO FIND THE OWNER OF
THIS CHARMING, UH"
HALF THE SIZE
OF YOUR MOTHER'S--
THIS GLASS SLIPPER,
ET CETERA, ET CETERA.
YOU'D BETTER
TAKE IT WITH YOU.
VERY DISTURBING.
HMM. I'M PROUD
OF YOU, EDWARD.
BY ROYAL COMMAND
OF HIS MAJESTY THE KING,
KNOW THIS--
THAT WHOSOEVER SHALL TRY ON
THIS SLIPPER
AND FIND IT A PERFECT FIT,
THEN, BY ROYAL DECREE,
SHE SHALL BE GIVEN
IN MARRIAGE
TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
THE PRINCE EDWARD OF EUPHRANIA,
HEIR TO THE THRONE.
GOD SAVE THE KING!
PUSH! PUSH!
OH, I AM PUSHING, MAMA!
IT DOESN'T FIT.
LET ME TRY.
OOH...
NOW, PUSH HARD!
Edward:
HAVE YOU FOUND HER?
ANY SIGN OF HER AT ALL?
AND YOU?
AND YOU?
SIR?
HMM?
I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANYONE SAYS.
I KNOW SHE EXISTS.
THE SLIPPER
WILL REMAIN THERE
AS A MONUMENT TO
MY LOST LOVE.
Edward:
HOW ABSURD LIFE IS.
DOWN THERE, EVERYTHING
IS So SIMPLE.
PEOPLE MEET,
FALL IN LOVE,
MARRY,
AND HAVE CHILDREN.
I DARESAY
THEY ENVY ME HERE.
I'M TOLD ENVY OF PRINCES
IS A COMMON ENOUGH THING.
Edward: 3 MONTHS,
6 DAYS, 10 HOURS.
THAT'S HOW LONG IT'S BEEN
SINCE LAST I SAW HER.
WHAT TORTURE LOVE IS!
YES.
OH, HOW SELFISH OF ME.
FORGIVE ME, JOHN.
HAVE YOU SEEN
YOUR LADY CAROLINE?
OH, YES...
INFREQUENTLY.
WHAT TORTURE LOVE IS.
YOU SEE, SIR, IF MY FATHER
WERE A CHANCELLOR...
HOW EASY IT WOULD BE
THE LOVELY
LADY CAROLINE
WOULD BE A PROPER
WIFE, YOU SEE
BUT MY FATHER
WAS A SERVANT
AND MY MOTHER
SAME AS HE
So THE LADY
OF MY CHOOSING
IS A WORLD AWAY
FROM ME

Edward: ALL RIGHT,
YOU'VE CONVINCED ME,
BUT I SHALL
PROVE YOU WRONG,
FOR PRINCES,
WHEN CONVINCED,
TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THEIR POSITION.
I CAN'T THINK WHY I DIDN'T DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT BEFORE.
John I ABOUT WHAT?
WAIT, AND ALL
WILL BE REVEALED.
KNEEL.
WHAT? ME?
I COMMAND IT.
I DUB THEE, AS IS MY
PRIVILEGE SO TO DO,
A KNIGHT OF THE ORDER
OF SAINT DAVID.
ARISE, SIR JOHN.
AS A KNIGHT
OF THE REALM,
YOU CAN NOW CLAIM THE HAND
OF THE FAIR LADY CAROLINE--
WHICH IS FORTUNATE
FOR YOU BUT WHICH, ALAS,
LEAVES ME WITHOUT
A COMPANION-AT-ARMS.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
UH, WILLOUGHBY,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
CAN HE NOT ANSWER
FOR HIMSELF?
IT'S NOT HIS
POSITIOH, YOU SEE.
AH, TRUE.
BUT IT WILL BE.
I SHALL ELEVATE YOU, TOO,
WILLOUGHBY.
FROM HENCEFORTH, YOU ARE MY
PERSONAL COMPANION-AT-ARMS,
WITH ALL THE PRIVILEGES
SUCH OFFICE BESTOWS.
YOU WILL NEED
A SWORD.
HERE.
TAKE MINE.
IT GOES THE OTHER
WAY AROUND.
HELP HIM, WILL YOU?
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD
MORNING'S WORK.
John: CONGRATULATIONS,
WILLOUGHBY.
AND CONGRATULATIONS
TO YOU, TOO, SIR JOHN.
WHAT CAN I SAY?
NOTHING.
GO AND FIND HER.
BE HAPPY.
HAPPY ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US.
I MUST FETCH THE PRINCE.
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN,
YOU WRETCHED GIRL? YOU...
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
OH!
OH!
I LITTLE KNEW, MADAM, THAT I WOULD
HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MEETING
YOU AND YOUR DELIGHTFUL DAUGHTERS
AGAIN IN SUCH HAPPY CIRCUMSTANCES.
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS?
YOU ARE THE LEGAL GUARDIAN, I
BELIEVE, OF MY WIFE TO BE.
YOUR WIFE TO BE?
WHY, YES. I AM MORE
THAN HER LEGAL GUARDIAN.
I HAVE BEEN A MOTHER TO HER.
THEN I DO RIGHT BY FORMALLY
ASKING YOUR PERMISSION
TO TAKE CINDERELLA'S
HAND IN MARRIAGE.
OH!
OH!
CONTROL YOURSELVES !
PERMISSION? WHY, OF COURSE!
GLADLY! NATURALLY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. DO I--
WILL YOU BE QUIET?
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,
PLEASE ALLOW ME THE HONOR OF
INVITING YOU INTO
OUR HAPPY HOME.
COME, CINDERELLA, DEAR.
WE WERE So WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
THANK YOU, BUT No, I HAVE OTHER
URGENT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.
IN MY HAPPINESS,
I FORGIVE YOU ALL.
FORGIVE ME?
HOW DARE SHE FORGIVE ME?
AND WHAT DO THEY CALL YOU?
CINDERELLA,
YOUR MAJESTY.
A MOST UNUSUAL NAME.
Edward: THE NAME, MOTHER,
IS SURELY OF No IMPORTANCE.
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT I'VE MADE MY
CHOICE AND WAIT FOR YOUR BLESSINGS.
YOU GAVE US A LOT OF TROUBLE,
YOU KNOW, AFTER THE BALL.
PEOPLE LOOKING FOR YOU
EVERYWHERE. VANISHED, YOU SEE.
DID YOU Go BACK
TO YOUR OWN KINGDOM?
NO, YOUR MAJESTY. I WENT
BACK TO WHERE I LIVE.
AND WHERE IS THAT, CHILD?
WHY, HERE,
YOUR MAJESTY.
HERE? IN THE CASTLE?
No, FATHER. AS YOU'VE OFTEN
REMARKED, LOVE IS BLIND.
AND WE SOMETIMES DON'T LOOK
UNDER OUR NOSES.
CINDERELLA LIVES IN OUR OWN
EUPHRANIA, NOT 20 MILES FROM HERE.
WHO IS THIS GIRL?
WHY DOESN'T SOMEBODY TELL
ME WHAT IS GOING ON?
THIS IS THE GIRL THAT
EDWARD WANTS TO MARRY.
IS GOING TO
MARRY, FATHER.
I DON'T WISH TO
SEEM OFFENSIVE,
BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME
THAT SHE'S MOST UNSUITABLY
DRESSED FOR SUCH A
SOLEMN OCCASION.
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT, GRANDMAMA. IT'S
SOMETHING I SHALL CORRECT IMMEDIATELY.
FATHER, BY YOUR LEAVE.
King: QUESTIONS
OF PRECEDENT.
UNPRECEDENTED
QUESTIONS OF PRECEDENT.
MY OWN THOUGHT,
SIRE.
A MEETING, I THINK.
THE STAFF COUNCIL.
IT HAS ALREADY BEEN
CONVENED, YOUR MAJESTY.
PITY. CHARMING
LITTLE THING.
IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES...
MOST APPEALING.
WHO IS IT?
MILADY, I'M COMMANDED
BY HIS MAJESTY THE KING
TO REQUEST AN AUDIENCE.
OH.
ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.
PLEASE ENTER.
MI LORD CHAMBERLAIN.
MILADY.
FORGIVE ME FOR
DISTURBING YOUR REST...
BUT, ALAS, THERE ARE
SOME MATTERS OF STATE
THAT CANNOT BE DELAYED.
HIS MAJESTY HAS REQUESTED ME,
AS HIS PRINCIPAL MINISTER...
TO BROACH...
A QUESTION OF
SOME DELICACY.
I...
YOU LOVE THE PRINCE EDWARD,
DO YOU NOT?
WHY, OF COURSE.
WHO WOULDN'T?
OH, QUITE SO.
UH, PLEASE. PLEASE.
AND HE HAS EXPRESSED
HIS LOVE FOR YOU
BEFORE THE WHOLE COURT.
YES.
YES, HE HAS.
VERY COMMENDABLY.
BIS MAKES...
OH, DEAR.
OH, DEAR. OH, DEAR.
OH, DEAR.
I'M REALLY TOO OLD
FOR THIS SORT OF THING.
FORGIVE ME,
MY DEAR CHILD, BUT...
DESPITE MY APPEARANCE
AND THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE
OF MY HIGH OFFICE...
I AM NOT WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING
OF YOUR PLIGHT.
FOR PLIGHT IT IS.
TO BE BLUNT,
BECAUSE THE HOUR IS LATE.
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HIS
MAJESTY TO GIVE CONSENT
TO SUCH A MARRIAGE.
NOT POSSIBLE?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
HMM. WELL...
YOUR LOVE
FOR THE PRINCE
AND HIS LOVE FOR YOU,
WELL, THAT IS A FINE
AND PRIVATE THING.
WOULD THAT IT COULD
REMAIN so,
BUT THE TIMES DEMAND
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
THE PRINCE MUST MAKE
A MARRIAGE OF ALLIANCE
WITH A PRINCESS
OF THE BLOOD ROYAL.
AND THAT IS WHY
I AM HERE,
BURDENED WITH
THIS UNHAPPY TASK.
YOU SEE,
MY DEAR CHILD,
IN LIFE, LOVE CANNOT
ALWAYS FIND A WAY.
YOU WERE BORN HERE,
SO YOU KNOW THAT
OUR LITTLE KINGDOM,
WHILST FAR FROM PERFECT,
HAS YET ENJOYED COUNTLESS
CENTURIES OF PEACE.
NOW THAT PEACE IS
THREATENED FROM WITHOUT.
THERE ARE SOME WHO LOOK
TOWARDS OUR FRONTIERS
WITH GREEDY EYES.
YOU SEE ONLY LOVE
AND HAPPINESS
STARING YOU IN THE FACE.
I SEE NOTHING BUT WAR
AND DESTRUCTION...
UNLESS A SACRIFICE
IS MADE.
AND THE SACRIFICE...
IS TO BE ME.
YES.
IT'S A LOT TO ASK,
BUT I HAVE TO
ASK IT.
TO LEAVE HIM NOW?
TO LEAVE HIM NOW,
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
BUT HE WOULD
SEARCH FOR ME AGAIN.
HE WOULD SEARCH
FOR ME AND FIND ME.
I KNOW HE WOULD.
YES. THAT, TOO,
IS TRUE,
BUT WE'VE ALLOWED
FOR THAT.
IT IS SUGGESTED
THAT WITH PROPER DOWRY
AND EVERY OTHER
CONSIDERATION
FITTING THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF THIS MOST UNHAPPY OCCASION,
IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOU BE
TAKEN FROM HERE THIS VERY NIGHT
TO A SECRET PLACE OF EXILE
FAR BEYOND OUR BORDERS.
YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN
NOTHING, THEN.
I THANK YOU FOR
BRINGING SUCH TIDINGS
WITH TACT
AND UNDERSTANDING.
YOU WERE WELL CHOSEN
FOR THE TASK.
YOUR LADIES-IN-WAITING
WILL BE SENT FOR.
BUT IN BOWING TO
THE ROYAL DEMANDS,
I MUST MAKE ONE
OF MY OWN.
MILADY?
IT IS NOT VERY MUCH
AND SOMETHING
WHICH...
WITH YOUR GREATER EXPERIENCE
IN THESE MATTERS,
YOU WILL NOT FIND
VERY DIFFICULT.
I WISH YOU TO TELL HIS
ROYAL HIGHNESS...
PRINCE EDWARD...
I WISH
YOU'D TELL HIM...
TELL HIM...
TELL HIM THAT
IT WASN'T LOVE
SAY I TRIED
SAY I LIED
TELL HIM
I'M UNWORTHY OF
WHAT HE FEELS
INSIDE
TELL HIM THAT
YOU HEARD ME SAY
WHAT SEEMED RIGHT
JUST LAST NIGHT
SIMPLY SEEMED
TO FADE AWAY
IN THE LIGHT OF DAY
TELL HIM OF THE
COUNTLESS OTHER LOVERS
WHOM I TANTALIZED,
VICTIMIZED
TELL HIM OF
THE MANY OTHER TIMES
I'VE PLAYED
THIS HEARTLESS GAME
JUST TEE SAW'.
'TELL HIM
WHAT I REALLY AM
IS JUST A COLD
AND EMPTY SHAM
TELL HIM ANYTHING
BUT NOT
THAT I LOVE HIM
TELL HIM THAT
IT WASN'T LOVE
ALL WE SHARED,
ALL WE CARED
MAKE HIM HATE
MY MEMORY
MAKE HIM GLAD HE'S FREE
PAINT ME EVIL,
PAINT ME CRUEL
SAY I BROKE EVERY RULE
MAKE HIM FEEL
THAT HE'S A FOOL
FOR HIS LOVING ME
DON'T LET HIM KNOW
WHY I MUST LEAVE HIM
WHY I MUS GO
SO FAR AWAY
FOR IF HE KNEW
HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM
NO POWER ON EARTH
COULD MAKE HIM STAY
YOUR MAJESTY.
THE DEED IS DONE.
SHE CERTAINLY BEHAVED
LIKE A PRINCESS.
Edward: COME ON!
THE FRONTIER!
FATHER.
FATHER, YOU HAVE DONE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
THE SPOILS
ARE YOURS,
BUT IT IS
A SMALL VICTORY.
IF I COULD EXPLAIN...
SPARE ME THAT.
SPARE ME THE FINAL HYPOCRISY
OF YOUR SYMPATHY.
TAKE YOUR MAP.
REARRANGE IT TO YOUR
HEARTS CONTENT.
MAKE YOUR PRECIOUS
MARRIAGE OF ALLIANCE.
YOU'VE DESTROYED WHATEVER
VESTIGE OF LOVE AND HAPPINESS
I MIGHT HAVE FOUND,
AND YOU'VE DONE IT IN
THE NAME OF PATRIOTISM.
SO... LET IT BE THUS.
CHOOSE ME A BRIDE
FROM AMONGST THE RAGBAG
OF ROYAL VIRGINS
I HAVE TWICE
REJECTED.
CHOOSE WHO YOU WILL.
I CARE NOT.
I'LL PLAY MY PUBLIC
PART TO THE ALTAR
BUT NO FURTHER.
YOUR ROYAL HOUSE
WILL LIVE WITH YOU
BUT DIE WITH ME.
DEAR CINDERELLA,
FORGIVE ME.
I HAVE NO HEART FOR WHAT
I MUST SHORTLY PERFORM.
MY HEART IS YOURS
AND YOURS ALONE.
I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU GRIEVE
FOR WHAT WAS NOT TO BE.
IT'S ONLY IN FAIRY TALES
THAT THE PRINCE...
MARRIES THE LADY
OF HIS CHOICE.
THE REAL WORLD
IS NOT SO KIND.
THERE ARE NO
PRIVATE KINGDOMS"
ONLY PUBLIC ONES.
I HAVE LOVED BUT ONCE.
I HAVE LOVED BUT YOU,
AND I HAVE LOST YOU TWICE.
I CAN'T FORGET
THE MELODY
ALTHOUGH OUR SONG
IS THROUGH
THE LOVE WE SHARED
THE DREAM WE DARED
WAS JUST A PRAYER
THAT CAN'T COME TRUE
I TRY TO STOP
REMEMBERING
BUT TILL THE DAY I DIE
WITHIN MY MEMORY
WILL LIVE THE MELODY
OF THE SONG
THAT WAS YOU AND ME
ALTHOUGH OUR SONG
IS THROUGH
I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU
FOR I CAN'T FORGET
THE MELODY
AND WHAT, MIGHT I ASK,
ARE YOU DOING HERE?
OH, IT'S YOU.
YOU GAVE ME
SUCH A SHOCK.
I SHOULD HOPE So.
THAT IS NOTHING TO THE SHOCK
YOU'VE JUST GIVEN ME.
WHY, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE HERE AT ALL.
THAT'S NOT
HOW I PLANNED IT.
OH, REALLY!
I SOMETIMES WISH
I COULD RETIRE.
UNLESS I'M
ON THE SPOT
TO TAKE CARE OF
EVERY LITTLE DETAIL,
SOMETHING
ALWAYS GOES WRONG.
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.
YOU STAYED BEYOND
THE STROKE OF
MIDNIGHT, DIDN'T YOU?
YES. OH, BUT PLEASE
DON'T SCOLD ME.
I'M UNHAPPY ENOUGH
AS IT IS.
WELL, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE UNHAPPY.
ANY GIRL
WOULD BE UNHAPPY
IF SHE WERE MISSING
HER OWN WEDDING.
WEDDING?
YES.
THE PRINCE GETS
MARRIED TODAY.
I HAD THE DATE
UNDERLINED IN MY DIARY.
WHY ELSE DO YOU SUPPOSE
I AM DRESSED LIKE THIS?
WHO...
WHO'S HE MARRYING?
WELL, AT THE MOMENT, THE
WRONG GIRL, OBVIOUSLY.
OH, IT'S
TOO IRRITATING.
I HAD IT
ALL MAPPED OUT.
WELL, I SUPPOSE I SHALL SIMPLY
HAVE TO RISE TO THE OCCASION
AND DO SOMETHING
SPECTACULAR YET AGAIN,
AND SPECTACULARS ALWAYS
TAKE So MUCH OUT OF ME.
JUST COME DOWN
OFF THE SWING.
IT WAS THE SAME
WITH SNOW WHITE.
ALL THE SAME,
YOU YOUNG GIRLS.
NEVER DO
AS YOU'RE TOLD.
MEN ARE MUCH EASIER.
OH, MAMA.
YOUR MAJESTY.
SIRE.

OVER?
WHAT A RELIEF!
YOUR MAJESTY,
THIS COULD LEAD TO WAR.
I KNOW, I KNOW!
WELL, THINK OF SOMETHING!
HE CANNOT
MARRY HER, SIRE.
THE CONSTITUTION
DOES NOT ALLOW IT.
WELL, DON'T TELL ME.
I WROTE IT.
YES. DON'T TELL HIM.
HE WROTE IT.
I BEG YOUR
PARDOH, MADAM?
AND IF HE WROTE IT,
HE CAN UNWRITE IT.
DON'T YOU AGREE,
YOUR MAJESTY?
HE CAN WRITE
WHAT HE LIKES,
So LONG AS
HE CLEARS THIS ROOM.
THERE ARE TOO MANY
PEOPLE IN IT BY FAR,
MOST OF THEM
NOT WORTH A CANDLE.
AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE THE KING.
YES, THAT'S RIGHT. I AM!
AND ABSOLUTE MONARCHS
SHOULD ACT ABSOLUTELY.
IT'S VERY BECOMING.
SHE'S RIGHT
WHO IS SHE?
I'VE NO IDEA, SIRE.
SHE MUST BE
ONE OF THE VISITORS.
BUT EVEN IF YOU ALTER THE
CONSTITUTIOH, YOUR MAJESTY,
IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM
OF THE OTHER BRIDE.
No, YOU'RE RIGHT. SO WE'RE
BACK WHERE WE STARTED.
IT'S STARING YOU
IN THE FACE.
WHAT IS?
THE ANSWER.
King: WHAT SORT OF
AN ANSWER IS THAT?
Fairy Godmother:
THEY'RE IN LOVE!
THEY ARE?
IT WAS LOVE AT
FIRST SIGHT.
YOU HAVE MY WORD
FOR IT.
ASK HIM.
COUSIN...
COUSIN, IT HAS BEEN
BROUGHT TO MY NOTICE--
OH, YES. AND TO MINE.
ISN'T SHE RAVISHING?
BUT, UH, AM I
TO UNDERSTAND--
YES... ANYTHING.
Woman: IT REALLY
IS DISGRACEFUL.
WELL, WHAT CAN WE DO AS FATHERS
FACED WITH THIS VERY HUMAN DILEMMA?
IT'S A QUESTION
OF HONOR.
YES. WELL, IT WOULD SEEM IN ALL
THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE, UH...
AFAIT ACCOMPLI?
IT'S CERTAINLY
A FATE. HA HA.
THE YOUNGER GENERATION'S
SO FICKLE.
NOT LIKE US,
NO SENSE OF DUTY,
NO SENSE OF HISTORY.
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF,
I HAD A SWORD IN MY BACK.
YOU, TOO?
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
WE NEVER SHIRKED
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES.
SO, WHAT'S IT TO BE?
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
ANOTHER WEDDING.
YES. IT LOOKS
LIKE THAT.
CAN I SPEAK
AS MAN TO MAN?
I'D WELCOME IT.
HE'S, UH, NOT WHAT
I WANTED, BUT, us...
THEN NEITHER
WAS SHE.
OH, CHARMING GIRL!
PLENTY OF SPIRIT.
I'LL ARRANGE EVERYTHING.
MY PLACE, I THINK.
THE SOONER THE BETTER.
YES, THUS CEMENTING
OUR GREAT ALLIANCE.
CONCEAL ING
OUR SHAME.
AMEN.
IN THE NAME
OF THE FATHER,
OF THE SOH, AND
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
AMEN.
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER
AND OF THE SON
AND OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.
AMEN.
AMEN.

I thought we weren't gonna think about bucks any more.
Well, I'm not. I'm not. I'm just wondering.
Speed is expensive. how fase you wanna go?

Hey! Asshole!
What did I tell you, Mrs. Stanton?
That if it was for you, they'd ask for the man of the house,
And if it was for me, to tell them I'd call them back.
I was washing my hair.
[phone ringing] Hello?
Yeah?
Everything under control?
Yeah. Merchandise on time?
It's been delivered and it's just waiting.
OK, Bunkie, I'll see you real soon.
All right, it's time. Call him.
I said, call him!
[ring tone] It's ringing.
[phone ringing]
Mr. Stanton, would you OK this check?
You don't have the lady's driver's license number.
Yeah, Would you like me to get that?
Oh, no, no, I've got that. You know her?
Oh, God, please answer.
Maybe you'd better dial again. The right number this time.
But I did. I did dial the right number.
[phone continues ringing] Stanton here.
George? Listen to me.
Evelyn.
There's a man here, and he wants the money.
I told you exactly what to say!
I know my husband better than you do.
Please.
George.
He says they'll kill us if you don't give him the money.
Let me talk to him.
[phone ringing] - Larry? - Yeah.
All set.
Ok.
Only, uh, there's something I think I oughta tell you.
I changed my mind.
You what?
You were right.
I mean, you take Moody Stocker.
If that 8-DL fuel cell's all it's cracked up to be,
How come Moody's still running a Firestone cell?
You son of a bitch.
Morning, Mr. Stanton.
It was supposed to be opened.
Mind if I use your phone?
It's a local call.
Lay down.
Oh, my God, no!
No!
Lady.
Lady, if I was attracted to rape, I would have waited till you finished your shower.
Now lay down and put your hands behind your back.
[phone ringing]
Whoever it is, get rid of them like I told you before.
Hello?
Uh, is the man of the house there?
Mm-hmm?
Yeah, howdy, partner.
We got a live one here who thinks maybe we're a couple of butterflies.
Yeah, he thinks a real stickup is something like a lot of hand grenades and guns or something.
You mind demonstrating that we mean what we say?
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, no! No, please.
George, you can't let him do this! Please!
No.
It's all right, Bunkie. I got it covered.
I'll see you soon.
[dial tone]
It'll be all right now, honey. It'll be all right.
Terrific.
Even brought my own bag.
Try not to squash the tomatoes.
Now, remember, we call you.
You try anything -anything- before you get that call,
And you cease to be a family man right then and there.
Hi, asshole.
What did you do with the keys?
Hey, you owe me 50 bucks.
What?
Well, listen. You gotta figure,
If you treat a decent girl like a whore, she should be paid like one, right?
If you don't give me those keys, I'm gonna pop you.
Ooh! You have something to eat.
I'm so hungry, I can't w...Oh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Robbery's a dangerous business.
That's right, lady. Now, let's have the keys.
- I'll go. - The keys!
OK. Relax.
[turns engine] [engine starts]
Those were the keys to my grandfather's pickup.
The keys to your grandfather's pickup?
That's beautiful.
OK, Miss Mary, have it your way, but any time you want out, you just holler, hmm?
You just holler.
[truck horn honking]
Jesus Christ. what the f'ck he's doing, anyway?
Did you see that crazy son of bitch?
Average.
[coughing]
I told you if you struggled, you'll puke.
If you puke, you'll choke to death on it.
[grunts] [coughing]
- You promise you won't say anything? - Yes.
- You won't yell, you promise? - Uh-huh.
OK. I'm trusting you, now.
- Mr. Stanton? - What?
It's 10:15. I have to get the cash drawers ready.
Oh, uh... Yes, yes, in a few minutes.
Is something wrong?
No! Would you go back to your office now?
Mr. Stanton?
They... They've got Evelyn and Cindy.
What? Where?
- At home. - I'll call...
Don't.
All set?
You'd better check with the stewardess in tourist section.
Good morning. Sleep well?
What's she doing here?
I work better with an audience.
No chance.
Look, I had about as much time to argue with her then as I got with you now.
Get in.
Her share comes out of your half.
Hey, listen, who says I want anything? 'Cause I don't.
Now, how can you not like somebody as full of shit as that, huh?
Maybe he just told you to wait for his call to give himself more time. Maybe he's already gone.
[dialing]
- Evelyn...<font color="yellow">- We told you not to call here.</font>
<font color="yellow">We told you we'd call you. Don't try it again.</font>
[dial tone]
Listen, whoever you are, please...
Damn you! He already hung up.
I told you not to touch that phone.
Honest, I was spouting off to a dial tone.
[dialing] Look, uh...God...
You're a neighbor, and, uh, you're calling to chat.
[phone ringing]
<font color="yellow">We told you not to call here.</font>
<font color="yellow">We told you we'd call you. Now don't try it again.</font>
- Oh, did I get a wrong... - [dial tone]
- That is a tape. - Are you sure?
Yes. You heard the dial tone right after click, didn't you?
Yes.
Well, it takes at least 30 seconds for my phone to disconnect after an incoming call.
I'm gonna call the police.

Held the wife and kid hostage.
- Anybody hurt? - No, sir. No guns.
How long ago did it happen?
Well, it was 15 minutes before we even got the call.
15...Ho, ho, ho, ho. 15 minutes?
Well, they used a tape gimmick on the phone, kept the manager from calling us.
- Anything else? - Uh...
Oh, yeah. A truck got in the guy's way. So he pancaked off a dozer ramp.
Locals figure it's souped.
Souped?
That's the driver, not the car. Let's go.
<font color="coral">[dispatcher] Car 9, Car 9, wait for ambulance...</font>

Let's get six of them.
<font color="coral">Investigate 8459 at warehouse..</font>
What the hell is this? A crap table? Huh?
Sir, we've blocked off every road leading to the freeway,
And we have units coming into this area.
You just break up all them roadblocks.
You put troopers in the Ranger lookout stations.
You call in all off-duty cars.
You pair them off, you start yourself a sweep search.
A sweep search?
You got trouble hearing me?
A roadblock can't find them, and I ain't waiting for them to find it.
Don't ask me any more questions. You do it.
Yes, sir.

So we got off to a bad start.
Well, you know what it means when somebody like me gets off to a bad start?
Not a goddamn thing.
[bus horn honking]
Everett, what the hell are you doing, playing around with a sweep search?
Well, you know me, Carl. I'm just a country boy.
What do I know?
I just figure I gotta find 'em, stop 'em.
Well, I ain't talking philosophies. I'm talking cars
Cars that we are not going to get because the appropriations committee will not understand you busting up roadblocks.
You've been holding those cars over my head a year now, and I'm getting tired of it.
You know, Ev, lot of times I actually enjoy your making things harder for me.
But this ain't in the same category as your refusing to wear a gun or a badge.
Oh, Carl, come on. Will you stop watching them Hollywood TV shows?
I mean, what the hell is the difference how I cut my hair
Or how I dress or if I wear a badge or a gun? Is that important?
Well, I'm not standing up in no more meetings and defending you.
Well, that's fine. Next time you get in front of that appropriations committee, you know what you tell them?
You tell them that these suspects... they ain't gonna get away. That's for sure.
And I'm doing it for me, for my own personal reasons.
It's got nothing to do with you or you getting your new patrol cars.
Kiss my ass.
Ah, Carl.
That's not nice.
[dials] Sheriff's department, please, right away.
You keep this up, you're gonna haul in a cop.
Hey, sounds like Miss Mary's getting afraid.
Oh, no, it's not that.
It's just I'm a normal human being, and stupidity scares me.
Yeah, me too. So why don't you vacate, huh?
I second the motion.
Oh, sure, why not?
After all, I can always hitch a lift back to town, tell them you held me as hostage and, uh...
- Oh, there's bags of things... - Yeah, who you gonna tell that to, huh, Miss Mary? The cops?
Boys down at Ralston Purina? Huh?
Hey, Deke. Miss Mary ain't gonna do nothing or say nothing, except behave herself. Right?
Aah!
[horses neighing]
So help me, if you try another stunt like that again, I'm gonna braid your tits.
When you people are through impressing one another,
I'd like to get out and look at the car.
Oh, just beautiful.
Mister... we got us some problems.
- A biggie, huh? - Yeah.
Thanks.
Come on, let's get this turkey undercover.
Mount Russo lookout station reports a blue Chevy moving like a bat out of hell.
Too far for positive ID, but it sure sounds like it could be our suspects.
- Host aids Bucola PD. - Yes, sir.
But if they're going into those walnut groves, we'll lose them.
They'll go clean out of the state.
- Well, who the hell said that? - Well, you did.
Not about them, but that someday somebody was gonna be smart enough to...
Well, if I didn't say it about them, not much point in discussing it, is there?
No, sir.
- How many units you got outside? - Six.
- Well, you get 'em right quick out to Bucola Road. - Yes, sir.
"Yes, sir. Yes, sir."
Haul ass to Bucola!
Now, that was cute. That was real cute.
Move cars 9 and 12 off Route 4 over to Taylor Road.
And then you call Fish and Game, you tell them to send that helicopter over.
Yes, sir. Did you get that?
Well, come on. Come on, come on.
<font color="coral">Headquarters to cars 9 and 12, Headquarters to cars 9 and 12.</font>
This is a hell of a time for a pit stop.
Yeah.
Ah. Just like Europe...no toilet paper.
You hear that, Deke?
Dingleberry here knows something about Europe.
Well, I should do. I spent six months there.
Sure.
I did too. With Jamie Richardson.
With Jamie Richardson.
Hey, Deke, with Jamie Richardson, no less.
Oh, right. You don't even know who he is, dingbat.
If he ain't won Daytona twice, I don't give a shit who he is.
Well, for your information, he's the lead singer of the group Scorpion.
I can remember when he was lead singer for the group Scrap Iron.
Hey, Deke, are you gonna be a while?
Yeah.
Great.
I think I'm gonna screw Miss Mary. Do you mind, Deke?
I mind, yo-yo.
Well, you didn't mind last night.
As a matter of fact, you kept begging for more.
Oh. Well, maybe that gives you some idea of how little I was getting.
How about that, Deke?
Super-crotch here goes to the big city, and right away,
She gets glib. You know why? Because she's scared, huh?
She gets too scared, and she comes running home to Grandfather's pickup.
- And you know all it takes to scare you? - What?
Little old me.
Well, Mister, things felt a little too good for you last night, so you ran.
And I'll tell you something else.
You don't know how to say hello, and you don't know how to say goodbye.
All right, I didn't say goodbye.
I had a robbery to pull this morning, woman!
Well, all right. It's not actually the goodbyes.
What pisses me is you didn't even leave me a clean towel!
Oh, God, if it hadn't been the goodbyes, if it hadn't been the towels, it would've been something else. You know why?
Because that's the kind of person you are. You know that?
You're the kind that's never satisfied.
You'd eat the last cookie in the jar!
And I'm telling you something...there's no more cookies in the jar, and there aren't.
But even if there was, you'd eat it!
And you'd go looking in my fridge for my pie stash!
That is totally untrue!
That is totally true.
You listen to me. You are crazy!
You are totally bananas.
Unload!
Oh, right. That is your total solution! Unload! Kiss off!
Well, you say that one more time, and I will!
Unload. Kiss off.
You mean that!
Unload! Kiss off!
Well, I goddamn will!
I won't come back! I swear to God I won't come back!
Is that a promise or a threat?
That's a promise! Well, hit it.
Goddamn you! Goodbye!
Hello.
Jeez.
Hey, Deke, come on, what are you trying to do? Establish squatter's rights?
I'm gonna need her at the wheel, and you underneath with me.
What?
I said, I'm gonna need her at the wheel and you underneath with me.
Terrific.
- Hey! - What?
You said I didn't know how to say goodbye.
Maybe I don't wanna say goodbye.
Oh, boy. I really wanna believe you... but I'm having trouble.
Mary, I... I've busted my crank for the last five years,
Trying to win enough money to build some real speed.
I finally had to take it. I had to steal it.
You know, I can't get near Riverside or Charlotte or Daytona unless I've got a machine, and now I...
I've got...
I need you... to help us with the car.
Ok.
You got it.
I don't know why, but you got it.
This is Franklin. Are you the UPI reporter man?
Uh, you want a statement? OK, here it is.
Uh, quote: "I admire any man who tries to get anything he wants "any way he can as long as it's legal.
"I may be a little old-fashioned, "but I believe in law and order.
"So this poor son of a bitch better start thinking,
'cause this is my territory, and I'm gonna get him."
Uh... yeah, OK. Well, unquote it now.
And see if you get the word "son of a bitch" in print.
Shit!
Damn wire's wrapped in too tight for me to get a hold of it.
Terrific. This is what you're gonna do for me in Riverside?
Say "shit" and pull a fade?
Tell her to start moving the wheel.
Hey! Start moving the wheel!
Just a second.
Hey!
Oh! Oh, I guess I must've fallen asleep.
- You dumb broad. - Well, I was bored.
Well, pay attention.
Pay attention.
- She got bored. - Oh, great.
Turn it to the left!
Easy.
Easy!
Why didn't you say so?
- It's coming... - Yeah, work it some more!
All right, to the right now.
To the right! Are you stupid?
Larry?
Larry!
Uh...
[toilet flushing]
Ah, Captain, helicopter's not available. The governor's got it.
What's he doing with my helicopter?
Well, he's dedicating a new building at a women's college.
He'll be through in about 15 minutes. You still want it then?
What do you think I want to do, smell the seats?
- Damn right, I want it. - Yes, sir.
Hey, rover. Tuck it in.
Why?
'Cause we're stopping.
Go get something for Deke's hand?
So, what if somebody sees me?
Say hi. Tell them how you went to Europe with Jamie Richardson.
[tires screeching]
Mister, she's gonna talk.
So what?
Six or seven miles till we switch cars, and we sure as hell don't want her around then, huh?
Hey, check the map for that second turn.
Where'd you put it? Under the seat.
Have you gone crazy? It's not here.
Every bone in her crotch. That's what I'm going to break.
[honks]
- Hi. - Hi. Hand it over.
Oh, sure. Why not?
You go left on Fryman, right on James Street, then you bypass Bucola down to Jackson, and then you switch cars at Dunton Flats.
- Dunton Flats. Get in. - Then...
[siren blaring]
Car 10 to Headquarters. Car 10 to Headquarters. We got 'em.
Haul your ass! We got 'em now!
- Go on, step on it. - Step on it? I am on it!
Positive ID. A blue Chevy on Route 9.
Heading in Jackson direction. Car 10 in hot pursuit.
All right.
Pull call cars 14 and 15 to intercept at Molly River.
Have all other cars stop their sweep and move right into Jackson area.
It's about time. Get cars 14 and 15.

Why? Are you worried you can't out-drive them?
Hey, buddy, you watching the temperature gauge?
It don't mean a thing. She always overheats.
Come on, baby. Goddamn it, come on. Let's go!
Hold on, baby. This is a roller coaster ride. Whoo!
Keep going, you're gonna blow this engine sky high.
I ain't blowing nothin', partner.
Jesus. Man, he's really on our tail.
Whoo!
I guess that's not a rod I hear.
That's right. It ain't. It taps.
Tap...It's my ass.

<font color="cyan">Now they're getting away.</font>
This is Franklin. You get over to Steve's, pick up that interceptor.
<font color="cyan">I didn't think that unit was ready yet.</font>
It's ready enough for the way you drive, and don't you wreck it.
Car 8 will be there in five minutes. The others will get there in ten.
You figured that out all by yourself?
Contact that helicopter. You tell them to meet me at Beacon's corner.

It was. We're just a hair off schedule.
Yeah. Well, we're gonna get right back on it.
[whirring]
Hey, wait a minute. Why aren't we slowing down?
She don't know me too well, does she, Deke?
Not likely she ever will. We have about one second to live.
Not too shabby.
Shabby? That wasn't even a squeeze.
No, I'll tell you what that was, mister.
That was a flash maneuver.
What the hell do you want me to do? Sit around for 15 minutes with a cop in a helicopter?
And we're not even in a second car yet?
Jeez.
Hey, Bunkie, that's the best time this turkey's ever done.
What the hell did you do to it?
Just hit it with a bigger hammer, that's all.
Where's Franklin?
He's gone to rendezvous with the helicopter, sir.
He what?
Get Franklin for me.

<font color="darkcyan">Everett, I want you to get back to Headquarters now.</font>
<font color="darkcyan">Now, I know you're reading me.</font>
<font color="darkcyan">Everett, aren't you taking this pursuit a little bit personal?</font>
I sure am.
And you know something? It gets worse every time you mouth off to me.
What's that supposed to mean?
You and your empire-building.
You don't want me to catch them. You never did.
<font color="cyan">Fact is, you'd be better off if they got away. That'd cinch it.</font>
Give you the excuse you're looking for to get all your shiny new cars.
That's all you gotin your brain, is having the biggest troop in this state.
<font color="darkcyan">Everett, I take it all back. I want you to catch them.</font>
Why?
Because if you do it, you think you're gonna feel young again.
<font color="darkcyan">[chuckles] But all you're gonna feel is tired.</font>
[chuckles] Hey, Carl?
What?
<font color="cyan">Kiss my ass!</font>
You know where Fryman Road is?
Right. But I've only got 45 minutes' fuel.
Why the hell didn't you stop and fill it up?
Hey, I was given orders to hit it and get it, and I follow orders.
That's good, because I give a lot of them.
Let's go.

Hey, Deke, take the money and the radio first, huh?
Then we get the tools. Come on.
Wow. Will you look at this place?
- I'll be back in a minute. - Huh?
- I said, I'll be back in a minute. - Oh.
- She'll be back in a minute. - Good.
How much you asking for this thing?
- Three dollars even. - I'll take it.
Oh, could I see that... Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Good God. I'm awfully sorry.
Why don't you watch what the hell you're doin'?
I guess we oughta check it out, huh?
Yeah, you're right. Uh...
- You take the left and I'll take the right, Ok? - Uh...huh.
Well, if it ain't Mary Coombs!
Hi, Mary.
Hey. Hey, guys, I, uh...
I really don't have time to talk right now.
Well, Mary's sure getting fancy, ain't she, Jake?

Oh, choo-choo-choo.

Well, if somebody would up and talk, uh...
I might not be able to hear them pipes.
It was just little old Mary Coombs.
Did anybody see a license number?
Hey. Had a black racing stripe.
I love it, Deke. We think of everything.
Tape recorder, two-way radio, the other car.
Everything but her.

This table's kind of screwy, too.

Hey, no fair! The guy's trying to make a shot!
You're not supposed to fool around!
Are you kidding? When Deke shoots pool, he's so loaded, he usually can't see the table.
Oh, hey, now, Bunkie. That ain't an excuse to go on a binge, you know.
Since when have I ever needed an excuse?
Ain't no drunk costing me another race.

One more time again?
Not married by any chance, are you?
Good morning, 007.
Good morning.
- Insomnia, sir?
- Instructions.
You haven't much time.
I'll explain as you pack.
Pack, sir?
Three of our agents have been killed during the last 24 hours.
Dawes in New York.
Hamilton in New Orleans.
- And Baines in the Caribbean.
- Baines, I rather liked Baines.
We shared the same bootmaker.
Coffee, sir?
I take it these killings are connected.
That's precisely what you're going to find out.
Baines was working on a small island in the Caribbean called San Monique.
Dawes was in New York keeping an eye on its prime minister, one Dr. Kananga.
Hamilton was on loan to the Americans in New Orleans.
Is that all it does?
By the way, congratulations seem to be in order.
The Italians were most impressed by the way you handled the Rome affair.
Thank you, sir. Sugar?
Thanks.
Well, the authorities were more than helpful.
There's one small complaint.
They seem to be missing one of their agents, a Miss Caruso.
You wouldn't happen to know where she is?
Miss Moneypenny.
Morning, Moneypenny.
- Good morning, sir.
- Certainly the hour that's indecent.
Really? I've got your ticket to New York.
Q has repaired your wristwatch.
And some background material on San Monique.
Thank you, Moneypenny.
I'm sure the overburdened British taxpayer will be fascinated to know how the Special Ordnance Section disburses its funds.
In future, Commander, allow me to suggest a perfectly adequate watchmaker, just down the street.
Good God.
You see, by pulling out this button, sir, it turns the watch into a hyper-intensified magnetic field.
Powerful enough to even deflect the path of a bullet at long range, or so Q claims.
I feel very tempted to test that theory right now.
If you don't mind, Commander, my spoon.
Oh, sorry, sir.
Thank you.
Dr. Kananga is, at present, in New York.
The CIA have been informed, and they're helping out with the surveillance.
Your flight arrives at 11:30 a. m.
Now, where did I leave my coat?
Oh, allow me.
Thank you.
Come along, Miss Moneypenny.
- Morning, Bond.
- Sir. Miss Moneypenny, thank you.
Goodbye, James.
Or should I say ciao, bello.
Such a delicate touch.
Sheer magnetism, darling.
A man comes.
He travels quickly.
He has purpose.
He comes over water.
He travels with others.
He will oppose.
He brings violence and destruction.
Hello. Mr. Leiter for you, sir.
Thank you. Hello, Felix. How are you?
Traffic permitting, I should be with you in about half an hour.
Then you can buy me the best lunch in New York.
Fine, James.
Your friend Kananga has just left the UN.
He's probably headed back to his embassy.
No, no, don't worry. I've got the place eyeballed, wired for sound, the works.
Right. I'll see you in about a half hour.
Easy, Charlie. Let's get there in one piece.
Charlie?
Right. Stand by.
Here comes Kananga's limousine.
Out he gets with the usual goon squad and the girl.
Time, 11:46.
What is that?
Hello, Felix?
You know how I hate to trouble you, but I've run into a little bother.
You what?
Get me a make on a white pimpmobile.
347 Nelson-David-George.
It would seem, Dr. Kananga, that the conference has not lived up to your prior expectations.
Well, we can only hope that this is a temporary setback.
However, I do have some observations to make.
Take a letter, please.
To Secretary-General,
Pan Island Unity Conference.
Sir.
I wish to point out that...
...too many of our island neighbors have once again let themselves be bullied by United States industry.
The story is an old one, the record a clear one.
Since my historic statement of principles was delivered and acted upon some six months ago, our economic outlook has improved dramatically.
By exercising our policy of friendship to all with favoritism towards none, new respect for the entire area has been engendered.
And even though some of my most important...
James, that car is registered to a shop at 33, East 65th Street.
That's only a block away from here. Right.
Take your time, buddy.
Kananga's knitting a flag in there.
It might be the easiest thing to do.
Something in heads?
Just browsing. Thank you.
Do you think you could gift-wrap it for me, please?
Lengthwise, if you don't mind.
Thank you.
...remains my first concern.
Thus, San Monique's future obligations vis-à-vis her island neighbors would seem clear.
Those who fawn and crawl in the face of intimidation must perforce to look up to those who stand proudly wrapped in a justifiable self-confidence.
The time has come, painful as it may be, to gaze out among our sister nations in the area and see if any stands tall...
He's tailing.
I got him in my sights.
- Hey, you know where you going, man?
- Uptown, I believe.
Uptown? You headed into Harlem, man.
Well, you just keep on the tail of that jukebox and there's an extra 20 in it for you.
Hey, man, for 20 bucks
I'll take you to a Ku Klux Klan cookout.
125th, you got a honky on your tail.
He's heading east.
Can't miss him.
It's like following a cue ball.
That's the car.
They must have gone inside.
Pull up where you can.
Sure hope you make friends easy.
Right on, brother.
He's heading on in.
Good afternoon.
Bourbon and water, please.
First booth will do.
- Tell him neat, would you?
- Huh?
- No ice.
- That's extra, man.
I'd like something on the side as well, information.
Three men and a girl came in.
Relax, baby.
Mr. Big's gonna take care of you in a minute.
Black queen on the red king, Miss...
- Solitaire.
- My name's Bond.
James Bond.
I know who you are, what you are and why you've come.
You have made a mistake.
You will not succeed.
Rather a sweeping statement, considering we've never met.
The cards have followed you for me.
Now, you get ripped off in Detroit, baby, you yell out to me, you hear?
Is he armed?
You can't be too careful in New York City these days.
Funny how the least little thing amuses him.
Oh, fascinating.
Well, that's you, quite obviously.
An amazing resemblance.
Tell me, am I in there as well?
Pick a card.
Turn it over.
You have found yourself.
I'm telling you, you all go out there to LA and clean it up, or I'm coming out there and clean you up, and I mean that!
Is this the stupid mother that tailed you uptown?
There seems to be some mistake.
My name is...
Names is for tombstones, baby.
You all take this honky out and waste him, now.
- "Waste him"? Is that a good thing?
- The reading is over.
Nothing about my future?
Us?
Now, promise you'll stay right there.
I shan't be long.
Thank you.
Keep your hands up, honky.
What does he think this is?
I'll blow his frigging head off, man.
Drop it!
Now.
"Harold Strutter, CIA."
Where were you when I didn't need you?
Kind of obvious you weren't coming out front, not even with that clever disguise you're wearing.
Whiteface in Harlem.
Good thinking, Bond. Let's get out of here.
I'm surprised they didn't spot you, too.
There's a most remarkable girl back there with a deck of cards.
I saw those cards on the way up.
Spades, James, every one.
You were nailed the minute you left 74th.
There's only supposed to be one man who can pull together that much black muscle in this town.
Calls himself Mr. Big.
You name the business, they say he has a black concession.
What would a foreign prime minister like Kananga want with an American gangster?
The question is, what would Mr. Big want with a two-bit island diplomat?
Mr. Big?
Where the hell does he fit into this mess?
A genuine Felix lighter. Illuminating.
Now, listen, James, we just found out that Kananga's got a private plane and he's leaving for San Monique within the hour.
Then get me on the next available flight, will you, Felix?
I already did.
I just knew you wouldn't pass up a chance to get away from where the real action is.
The legendary Baron Samedi, folks.
That's Saturday, for those of you who speak French.
Voodoo god of cemeteries and chief of the legion of the dead.
The man who cannot die.
But for our purposes, just a performer in a little musical extravaganza we've cooked up for you wonderful people.
Good evening. The name is Bond.
You have a reservation for me.
Yes, Mr. Bond, of course.
Mrs. Bond has been expecting you.
- Mrs. Bond?
- She arrived earlier this afternoon, sir.
Said she preferred something a little more private.
Bungalow 12.
An incurable romantic, Mrs. Bond.
Room service, please.
Room service?
This is Mr. Bond, bungalow 12.
I'd like a bottle of Bollinger, please.
Slightly chilled.
Two glasses. Thank you.
Anybody home?
Your champagne, sir.
- What was that?
- Your champagne.
Put it on the table. Thanks.
- Shall I open it?
- What?
Shall I open it?
No. I can manage. Thank you.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Bond, I presume?
I'm Rosie Carver.
I guess I have a little explaining to do.
Yes. Either you or dear Uncle Felix.
Custom. 38 Smith & Wesson.
Corrugated 3-inch stock. No serial number.
Standard CIA issue.
Question is, why point it at me?
The man who delivered your champagne is not a hotel waiter.
I was just trying to be careful.
As for Felix Leiter, you're right.
I've worked for CIA down here for some time now, and he cabled me you were coming and asked if I wouldn't help out, if I could.
Perhaps you'd better start by getting your head together.
- There's a mirror in the bathroom.
- Yes.
You're only my second mission, you know.
My first was Baines, the agent who was killed.
It's a relief to know I'm next in line for the same kind of aid.
There's a...
- There's a...
- A snake. I forgot. I should've told you.
You should never go in there without a mongoose.
I should have never gotten into any of this.
I'm going to be completely useless to you.
I'm sure we'll be able to lick you into shape.
It's getting late, Mrs. Bond.
Tomorrow is going to be a very busy day for us.
You see, Kananga is protecting something down here, something which
Baines obviously discovered.
You're going to show me the spot where Baines' body was found.
That, I'm afraid, only leaves us tonight to, well, catch up on old times.
Felix told me there'd be moments like this.
What did good old Felix suggest?
If all else failed, cyanide pills.
I settled for two bedrooms.
Good night, Mr. Bond.
Mrs. Bond.
Why, it's just a hat, darling, belonging to a small-headed man of limited means who lost a fight with a chicken.
It's a warning. Get it out of here!
Please.
Please don't leave me alone tonight.
James, please promise me.
All right, darling, if you insist.
I promise.
I thank you.
Rosie!
Breakfast's up!
- Rosie, are you ready yet?
- What?
I have to see about organizing a car.
I'll see you in the lobby.
Over here, sir. Over here.
Guaranteed big fish.
- Catch big fish, sir.
Hey, baby.
Over here. Bring your man over here.
Just $20. Half a day.
You got warm lady.
We got cold beer over here, man.
You wanna catch a big fish, sir?
It's only 2 pounds over here.
Good morning.
Come on, Rosie.
This one seems eager enough.
Excuse me. Where can I change?
Me. Clothes off. Where?
Stop right there.
Turn around slowly.
Keep your hands up!
As I was saying, Quarrel, a lousy agent.
But the compensations speak for themselves.
Rosie Carver, meet the man who shares my hairbrush,
Quarrel Junior.
I'm really sorry.
I could've shot you.
You might have even killed me if you'd taken off the safety catch.
Never mind, darling.
You just let us know when we get to the spot where Baines was killed.
It's up in the hills just after we clear the next cove.
Hey, Quarrel, who the hell lives up there?
That's the house of the Kananga woman.
She's supposed to have the power of the obeah.
No one on the island dare go up there except him.
He comes again.
There will be violence.
He approaches even now.
By land or water?
Water.
He has arrived.
Good.
Rosie's been more efficient than I anticipated.
I know a place where we can rustle up a car.
Beautiful, brave and now resourceful.
Rosie, you seem to be staging a remarkable comeback.
Tell me about the future.
Is it death?
I said, is it death?
It is death.
They're coming.
Rosie knows what to do.
Now, I want no bodies this time, no trace.
It's down there.
But I thought you said Baines was killed up in the hills, darling.
Up in the hills down there.
Why don't we have a bite of lunch and discuss it?
There's an excellent patty in the hamper.
I'm in no hurry.
Are you?
No.
James, you don't know what finding you has meant to me.
Oh, I can imagine.
And you've no idea what finding this has meant to me.
You do know what the Queen of Cups means in an upside-down position?
A deceitful, perverse woman, a liar, a cheat.
And I'd like some answers now.
Please.
You don't understand, see.
They'll kill me if I do.
And I'll kill you if you don't.
But you couldn't. You wouldn't.
Not after what we've just done.
I certainly wouldn't have killed you before.
It used to be a convincing act, Rosie.
It's wearing a little thin now.
It's not an act. It's...
Make your choice.
Rosie.
You will explain what went wrong.
I see the intervention of a woman.
The girl was about to confess.
We had to kill her.
The trap was set.
Tee Hee was waiting.
And you saw death.
It must have been the girl's death.
If you do not ask specific questions
I cannot be responsible for your misinterpretation of the answers.
These growing signs of impertinence begin to disturb me, Solitaire.
Even as they did with your mother before you.
She had the power and lost it, became useless to me.
You will not make the same mistake.
Solitaire.
Where is Bond now?
I cannot see when you are this way with me.
Things become unclear.
Let us hope these momentary lapses do not become a habit.
Your power exists to serve me, and it is mine to control.
If and when the time comes
I decide you are to lose it,
I myself will take it away.
Solitaire, go to sleep.
You have made me angry with you, and I have no wish to be.
Tee Hee.
Put down those cards.
It is a blasphemy.
They tell nothing to those who cannot see.
But they do. That's a bit of luck.
Good luck for both of us.
The cards say we will be lovers.
You're mistaken.
It's impossible, forbidden for me.
Now you must go.
But you do believe,
I mean really believe, in the cards.
They have never lied to me.
Then they won't now.
Pick one.
You knew the answer before it was given.
Strangely enough, somehow so did I.
So it's finally happened.
Just as it did to my mother and her mother before her.
Well, of course it did.
Well, you're visual proof of that, aren't you?
Come on. Cheer up, darling.
Has to be a first time for everyone.
Now, tell me, where's Kananga?
I cannot see.
- Oh, yes, the cards. I'll get them.
- No.
There's no need to be frightened.
You'll soon be rid of him, I promise.
I promise.
I just need a little bit of information, that's all.
The power,
I've lost it.
The high priestess is wife to the prince, no longer of this world.
The spiritual bridge to the secret church.
It's my fate.
By compelling me to earthly love, the cards themselves have taken away my powers.
Darling, I have a small confession to make.
Now, try not to be too upset.
The deck was slightly stacked in my favor.
It makes no difference.
The physical violation cannot be undone.
When he finds out I've lost my power, he'll kill me.
Now, come on. He'll have to find you first.
Lovers' lesson number one, we have no secrets.
For example, I have a boat waiting.
You can be on it.
All I have to know before we leave is what goes on back there in Voodooland.
Darling, three men and a girl have been killed in the last four days, not counting the number of times they've tried to stop me from discovering whatever Kananga's protecting.
Now, do you want to be on that boat or not?
I simply read the cards for him.
I've never been there, and he's never taken me there.
I've never dared to go, but I've looked in the cards.
I've seen great riches there.
They'll kill you.
Us, darling.
They will kill us.
Lovers' lesson number two, togetherness till death do us part, or thereabouts.
Is there time before we leave for lesson number three?
Absolutely.
There's no sense in going off half-cocked.
- This way.
- How can you be so sure?
Well, these scarecrows are to scare people away. You're not scared, are you?
Lesson number four, follow the scarecrows.
- Good morning, boss.
- Good morning.
It's sure gonna be a beautiful day.
Yes, sir, a beautiful day.
They're heading for the hill.
They're here.
If he finds it, kill him.
Quick!
We've lost him. He has the girl.
They're somewhere under the nets.
At any cost, any.
Bond must die.
Unit two-five, we have picked them up.
Base to two-five. Arrest Bond.
But, I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.
Message received and understood.
Over and out.
Base to all units.
I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.
Sweet mother of pearl.
All change. End of the line.
Get down below quickly.
Here. I'll do that. You get us started.
It appears a bust.
James.
He'll be looking for me now.
I know he'll never stop.
Come on, darling.
It's all over.
Voodooland was just poppy fields.
A simple matter of heroin smuggling.
I'll have a word or two with a man named
Felix and turn the entire case over to him.
And you and I will be off.
By the way, where would you like to go?
Anywhere where we can find one of these.
How quickly can we make it to New Orleans?
Santa Mina, four hours away.
You can catch a flight and be there in the morning.
Then get in touch with Felix on the scrambler.
Tell him to meet me there tomorrow.
Royal Orleans Hotel.
Tampa is closer.
Hamilton was killed in New Orleans, so there has to be a connection.
And this is a valuable piece of merchandise we are carrying, which with any luck, they'll want back.
Royal Orleans Hotel, please.
Are you sure this is the way to New Orleans?
I don't know, but it sure beats the hell out of Harlem, don't it?
Well, hello, Jim. What's happening, baby?
Just ease back now, Jim. Relax.
Mr. Big wants to see you.
You made a mistake back on that island, Bond.
You took something that didn't belong to you, and you took it from a friend of Mr. Big's.
That type of mistake is tough to bounce back from.
- But I've only just arrived.
- Today is your lucky day, Jim.
You're going skydiving.
There's a hell of a view of the lake from 10,000 feet.
My only regret is I won't be there to see it.
- Good morning. You're...
- Mrs. Bell. You're not my instructor.
- Where's Mr. Bleeker?
- Indisposed. I'll be giving the lesson.
Come on, come on!
What's on for today?
Well, let's just wing it, shall we, Mrs. Bell?
You're over-revving.
Leroy, slow down!
For Pete's sake, slow down!
Do what the man say!
I can't find the brake!
Close those doors!
Holy shit.
Look out! Look out!
Okay, Don. Don't worry. I'll take care of it.
Right. Talk to you later.
I gotta go and give a lesson.
Same time tomorrow, Mrs. Bell?
Yes, Mr. Bleeker.
Yes, sir. Well, I know you just can't glue the wings back on.
Now, Mr. Bleeker, I'm sure there's no reason for name-calling.
No, that's fine.
- You can fit the rest this afternoon.
- Right, sir.
Don't forget the double vents.
I appreciate she may be one of your best pupils, yes.
That'll do nicely. That's a little frantic.
I'll keep the other three.
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Bleeker, any suggestion of that kind should be forwarded in writing to Washington.
- How is Mrs. Bell?
- Intensive care. But she'll pull through.
Yes, sir. Oh, no, sir, no one's questioning your patriotism.
I'm sure you're a veteran, sir.
Felix, you might find out if there's a Fillet of Soul restaurant in town.
James, we're way ahead of you.
It's on Docker Street.
Strutter's watching it now.
Hell of a send-off.
This way.
- Where's Strutter?
- He's gotta be inside somewhere.
Two, gentlemen?
I got a nice booth over here just against the wall.
Do you think you could find something a little closer to the stage?
- What's wrong with a booth?
- I once had a nasty turn in a booth.
- Bourbon. No ice, please.
- Two Sazeracs.
Where's your sense of adventure, James?
This is New Orleans. Relax.
When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
- One of you guys called Felix Leiter?
- Yeah. Right here.
Telephone call for you. Guy called Strutter.
Thanks. For a minute there, I thought
Harry was laying down on the job.
Say live and let die
What does it matter to ya?
When you got a job to do, you got to do it well
You got to give the other fellow hell
What happened to my...
- What happened to my friend?
- What happened to your friend? Listen...
Thanks for dropping in, baby.
Yeah, you one tough pig to nail down.
You've been picking at me like some kind of maggot.
First, you go up to Harlem and kill one of the brothers.
That disturbed me.
Well, then you go and steal this valuable young lady from my good friend, Dr. Kananga.
Now, old Kananga, he believes in all that card crap. I mean, he's mad.
Well, possession being nine points of the law,
I would say Kananga is your problem now.
Thank you.
In fact, if I were you,
I'd watch my step from now on.
Yeah, well, you just let me handle our business with the man.
I've got my own plans for you, baby.
But first, there's one little question that he wants answers for.
In that case, you'd better ship me back to the island and let him ask in person.
I'm not in the habit of giving answers to lackeys.
You damn lucky you got a ear left to hear the question with.
Which is, did you mess with that?
That's between Solitaire and myself and
Kananga. I'll tell him when I see him.
You ain't gonna see the sunlight unless you answer me!
I had no idea you were so frightened of him.
- Did you touch her?
- When I see Kananga.
Right.
Quite revealing.
Kananga, poppy grower in thousands of acres of well-camouflaged fields protected by the voodoo threat of Baron Samedi.
And as Mr. Big, distributor and wholesaler through a chain of
Fillet of Soul restaurants.
Wholesale?
Sell heroin for money?
My apologies.
I'm sure you simply give it away.
Excellent, Mr. Bond.
That's precisely what I intend to do.
Two tons of it to be exact.
When entering into a fiercely competitive field, one finds it advisable to give away free samples.
Man or woman, black or white.
I don't discriminate.
Two tons of heroin with a street value well over a billion dollars, nationally distributed free?
That should make a certain group of families rather angry, wouldn't you say?
Angry?
Why, my dear Mr. Bond, it'll positively drive them out of their minds and, subsequently, out of the business.
Quite ingenious.
A sort of junkie's welfare system.
Well, merely until the number of addicts in the country has doubled, shall we say.
Then I will begin to market that acreage that you blundered into the other day.
That heroin will be very expensive indeed, leaving myself and the phone company the only two going monopolies in this nation for years to come.
And here I thought it was Solitaire did the fortunetelling.
Let's hope for both of your sakes she still can.
The question still stands, Mr. Bond, asked by the gentleman concerned.
Did you touch her?
Why, it's not the sort of question a gentleman answers.
Well, having set the example,
I don't expect Miss Solitaire to be any less the lady.
By the way, that's a particularly handsome watch you're wearing, Mr. Bond.
- May I see it, please?
- You'll forgive me if I don't get up.
Butterhook.
Tee Hee, on the first wrong answer from Miss Solitaire, you will snip the little finger of Mr. Bond's right hand.
Starting with the second wrong answer, you'll proceed to the more vital areas.
Solitaire, my dear,
I want you to listen to me very carefully.
On the back of Mr. Bond's watch, the registration number
Do I speak the truth?
You speak the truth.
Well.
If nothing else, at least
I have laid your fears to rest.
My compliments on a splendid operation.
There is one thing, however, the...
Whisper, take him to the farm.
When do we start back?
Soon, Solitaire, soon.
Solitaire, why?
I treated you well. You lacked for nothing.
- I don't understand what you...
- Mr. Bond's watch, my dear.
I gave you every break possible.
You had a 50-50 chance.
You weren't even close.
I had no choice.
Please believe me. The cards.
When the time came,
I myself would have given you love.
You knew that. You knew that!
There's only one proper way to deal with this.
And one proper time.
The tonnage order is nearly complete.
We move it out tonight.
And I mean tonight.
Mr. Bond.
How much do you know about crocodiles, Bond?
Oh, I've always tried to keep them at arm's length, myself.
Cute little nippers, ain't they?
I don't suppose those potential overnight bags are orphans?
Oh, no.
We have some moms and dads, as well.
In fact, quite a few thousand.
This is the part I like best, feeding time.
I suspect the highlight of the tour.
Some of these babies live to be 200 years old.
Look over there.
That's an alligator.
You can always tell by its round nose.
There's old Albert.
He's a croc.
Got over-careless with him sometime back and he took my whole arm off.
- Well done, Albert.
- They'll eat anything, even each other.
Then again, sometime they can go a whole year without eating.
Oh, I was rather counting on that.
There are two ways to disable a crocodile, you know.
I don't suppose you care to share that information with me?
One way is to take a pencil and jam it in the depression hole behind his eyes.
And the other?
Oh, the other is twice as simple.
You just put your hand in his mouth and pull his teeth out.
It's on fire!
Adam, get him!
Adam, get the car! Cut him off!
Hector, move, damn it!
Bond ripped off one of our boats!
He's headed for the Irish Bayou.
The man that gets him stays alive.
Now, move, you mother...
Toby!
Toby, I got me a regular
Ben-Hur down here doing 95 minimum.
- Need any help, J.W.?
- Hell, no!
You got a set of wheels that just won't quit, boy.
If they're yours, that is.
You spin around, boy.
Ten fingers on the fender.
Legs apart.
I'm sure this ain't exactly your debut with this sort of thing.
You picked the wrong parish to haul ass through, boy.
Nobody cuts and runs on Sheriff J.W. Pepper.
And it's him speaking, by the by.
What the...
J.W., soon as you nail that offending vehicle,
Miss Pearson just called.
Seems her dog's foaming all at the mouth.
She's got him locked up in her shed, wondering if you'd like to come over and shoot it for her.
You tell Miss Pearson take a flying...
That look like a boat stuck in the sheriff's car there, Eddie?
Boy, where you been all your life?
That there's one of them new car-boats.
By the powers invested in me by this parish
I hereby do commandeer this vehicle and all those persons within.
And that means you, smartass.
Unit 23 in position.
Ten-four, 23. Come in, 28.
Hey, J.W., seems like Deke Rogers done got his boat stole off the river.
But picked up a new one in his swimming pool.
Sheriff, you want to get your boys off our frequency?
Give me that!
Now you listen to me, trooper boy!
We got a swamp full of black Russians driving boats to beat the dam down here!
Relax, Sheriff. We've got a roadblock waiting for them at Miller's Bridge.
Unit 26 at Miller's Bridge.
We're just about all set here.
Make that secure there, you hear?
Okay, fellas, here they come.
All right, out of my way!
I'm in charge here!
You two boys, come on!
I don't want excuses, trooper.
I want those two men and their boats
- apprehended immediately, did you hear?
- Yes, sir, Captain.
I understand. But I don't know right off where we're going to find a boat fast enough to catch them.
I got it.
You call my brother-in-law Billy Bob.
He got the fastest boat on the whole damn river.
Billy Bob will sure enough fix their ass, huh? Yeah, call Billy Bob.
Now, there's two boats, Billy Bob, and they're moving like buttered pigs.
Now, I promised these boys here you would get them.
- Don't let me down, hear?
- Cool down, J.W. I'm on my way.
- You want something, boy?
- Yes, I'd like to borrow this boat, if I may.
Everybody on the river would like to borrow this boat.
Billy Bob, we got them spotted.
They're headed for Haley's Landing.
That's my brother-in-law! That's Billy Bob!
He'll get them. Billy Bob'll get them.
Hot damn!
If one side of the Pepper family don't get them, the other side will.
Let's go!
If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together let him now speak, or else hereafter...
Headquarters to all units, suspects seen proceeding down via Liberty towards Highway 11.
Proceed with caution.
Would you get that chicken coop off the road?
Did you ever think of getting a driver's license, boy?
Are you sure that was your brother-in-law, Sheriff?
- Hello, Felix. What are you doing here?
- We'll get to that later.
Kananga's in town. He's got your girl with him. They just took off.
There's the son of a bitch!
I got him!
What are you?
Some kind of doomsday machine, boy?
Well, we got a cage strong enough to hold an animal like you here.
Captain, would you enlighten the sheriff please?
Yes, sir.
J.W., let me have a word with you.
J.W., now, this fella's from London, England.
He's an Englishman working in cooperation with our boys, a sort of secret agent.
Secret agent?
On whose side?
We busted the Fillet of Soul an hour ago.
We came up with nothing but these.
Kananga's clear. You should have seen the size of the guy who got on the boat with him.
Nine feet tall, I swear.
Big top hat, a cockamamie flute in one hand and Solitaire in the other.
The incendiary bombs are set for midnight.
Now, that gives you exactly 30 minutes.
Watch out for sharks on the way back.
- I'll see you for breakfast, Felix.
- Good hunting.
You're going to need these and the shark gun on the way back.
- Seems like the party's started.
- My regards to Baron Samedi, man, right between the eyes.
Trouble!
Ah, Mr. Bond, there you are!
And Miss Solitaire, as well.
Hardly unexpected, but most welcome.
Whisper!
Two more glasses for our guests!
- What shall we drink to, Mr. Bond?
- Well, how about an earthquake?
Welcome home!
- Where's our boy?
- He'll be along anytime now.
I checked behind a rock, and his wet suit is gone.
Keep the change.
It's unfortunate that your wet suit was discovered only minutes before the field was destroyed.
- Don't tell me you're not insured.
- No. The poppy's a very sturdy flower.
You have been a relatively minor nuisance, in fact.
But this gun...
I find it particularly fascinating. What is it?
A shark gun, naturally, with compressed gas pellets.
Ingenious!
Don't pull the pin out.
The air in here is foul enough already.
Somehow I never thought of you as a poor loser.
I was hoping you would join me to a drink to the future.
Oh, Miss Solitaire used to know all about the future.
She was especially good at predicting death.
An underground monorail.
Connected to the last refuge of a scoundrel, no doubt.
The heroin leaves here, I take it, carried somewhere by that winch.
Correct again, Mr. Bond.
What a quick study you are.
Let me show you exactly how it works.
- Where in hell can the man be?
- Relax.
He must have got tied up somewhere.
These cans hold 25 pounds each.
There are 20 cans to a shipment, packed in watertight...
Metal containers.
It's your show, Kananga, but I'm sure there must be a simpler way of drowning someone.
Drown, Mr. Bond?
I doubt you'll get the chance to drown.
Perhaps we could try something in an even simpler vein.
On the contrary, Mr. Bond.
I think you'll find those wounds quite fatal.
Whisper.
The gate.
Oh, slowly, Whisper! Slowly, slowly.
Let our diners assemble.
Look out!
Where's Kananga?
Well, he always did have an inflated opinion of himself.
Oh, James, how do we get out of here?
We take the train, of course.
Well, thanks for everything, Felix.
I'll see you tomorrow night at the 21 Club, and don't be late.
I still don't see why you want to travel this way.
I mean, what the hell can the two of you do on the train for 16 hours?
Say goodbye to Felix, darling.
Now, the first thing to learn in playing gin rummy is to never take a card from the exposed pile, unless you really need it.
Gin.
James, what are you doing?
Just testing an old adage.
Unlucky at cards...
- Do hurry up, James.
- Won't be a moment, darling.
Lock the door as well on your way up, would you, James?
After all, we wouldn't want anyone to just walk in on us, would we?
The first time in my life,
I feel like a complete woman.
The slightest touch of your hand,
I was always so afraid that a part of me would stay with the past.
But now I know there's no chance of that any longer.
Just to be able to reach out and touch you.
Mr. Bond, it's good to see you again.
Well, that wasn't very funny.
Now what are you doing?
Just being disarming, darling.
When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
You know you did, you know you did
You know you did
But if this ever-changing world in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die
Looking for something?
Yes, a grave.
No one's had time to die here yet.
You can see there is no graveyard.
This was a long time ago.
Actually, not such a long time.
Nearly three years.
I buried a friend here.
A friend.
Huge trees stood here.
A cedar and a fir tree.
Remember them?
Probably chopped down when the settlement was built.
Could it be those?
Dersu!
In the islands, the hunter
Roams all day long
But no luck for him
And he curses himseIf
What's he going to do
How is he to serve
He cannot be cheerful
So what
He'll try to aim better
So the hunter goes
To warmer waters
Where the fish were frolicking
In the beautiful weather
There on the shore
That year... my assignment was to go to the Shkotovo area... in the Ussurii region... to make a topographic survey.
Sometimes mountains and forests look cheerful and attractive.
At other times, they seem sullen and wild.
This isn't just my own feeling.
All the men in the unit share this feeling.
With God's help, we will spend the night here.
And tomorrow, we'll find a more cheerful place.
Very well.
We'll halt here for the night.
Yes, we'll stay here for the night.
That valley reminded me... of Walpurgis Night... a place where witches would gather for their Sabbath.
What's that?
A falling rock.
Is someone coming down?
It's a bear!
Please to not shoot!
Me are people!
Hello, Captain.
Look. A man.
You said it was a bear.
Won't you join us?
Thanks.
I am very hungry.
Nothing to eat today.
Who are you?
A Chinese?
A Korean?
No. Me is Goldi.
A hunter?
Me hunt all the time.
No other job.
Where do you live?
Not have home.
Build a shack and sleep, and living like in a home.
No luck today?
Today shoot at stag.
Me not hurt him much.
Stag run away.
Me follow after it.
Me see people tracks.
Me go slow.
Me think:
''What kind of people so far in the hills?''
Me look close.
See Captain, soldiers.
So me come here quick.
Why did you miss the stag if you're such a good hunter?
You never miss?
We're soldiers.
We're not supposed to miss.
You great hunter, shoot all beasts... we don't have anything to eat.
Hey, you!
Enough babble!
Well, well.
Here. Now you can babble.
My name is Arseniev.
What's yours?
Dersu Uzala.
How old are you?
I don't know well.
Me live a long, long time.
Do you have a family?
They all die long ago.
Before, I had a wife... son and girl.
The smallpox finish all people.
Now me left alone.
Look, Dersu.
We are surveying this area-- the ranges, passes and rivers.
Will you be our guide?
Necessary me think.
Stop it.
Well, think it over.
Now, let's go to sleep.
The next day, without saying a word...
Dersu took his place at the head of our squad.
There is a road here.
- A road!
- Come here! There's a road!
What's there?
This road two, three days before, one people come.
Then rain come.
These people Chinese.
Where did you get that?
How you not understand?
Look well!
He wear Chinese boots.
Water in his tracks.
You the same as children.
Eyes not see.
You live in the forest, die soon.
Chinese!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Soon we find shack.
How do you know?
Look!
Strip bark.
Make roof.
The rain-soaked ashes... the bed of grass... and a discarded piece of Chinese fabric... all confirmed Dersu's words.
Obviously, a Chinese spent the night a couple of days ago.
Did you see that?
Yegor!
Captain.
Rice, salt, matches, give some.
What do you need it for?
Rice, salt, matches.
Wrap in birch bark, put in shack.
You plan to return?
Why return?
Other people come.
Find dry wood.
Find food. Not die.
Olentiev!
Bring matches, rice and salt.
At your command.
This Goldi filled me with admiration.
He had amazing insight... acquired during his long life in the forest.
Besides, he had a beautiful soul.
He provided for the needs of a person he didn't know... and probably wouldn't ever see.
Dersu, let's wait until the rain stops.
Time to get ready.
Listen good.
Birds are starting to sing.
Rain soon stop.
Sun is coming out.
Dersu, do you know what the sun is?
Everyone knows the sun.
Could be that you've never seen the sun?
Look, there it is.
Captain.
Sun is the most important men.
This men die, all die.
And this is another important men.
This is bad men. Shout.
If one listens to you, everything around are men.
Look. All is men.
Water alive.
Well, you said it.
Is fire alive too?
Yes, fire is still men.
Fire angry, forest burn for many days.
Fire get angry, frightful.
Water get angry, frightful.
Wind get angry, frightful.
Fire, water, wind.
Three mighty men.
The first snow fell that day.
- Why shoot?
-Just for fun.
- Step back, Dersu.
- Waste bullets, bad.
What waste? We're soldiers.
We're practicing.
- Screw it!
- Seryoga drank too much.
Let me try. Taras!
What a shot!
Go!
What the hell?
It's harder than bringing down a flying bird.
Good shooter not miss.
Go ahead, old man.
Try it yourself.
Why shoot and smash? Why break?
Where in forest you find bottle?
Are you trying to worm your way out of it?
Just admit you won't hit it.
Me not shoot at bottle.
Me shoot at rope.
Bottle fall down, you give me bottle.
Hit the rope?
Go ahead.
It's yours if you hit the rope, and I will fill it with vodka.
Go, Marchenko!
Go!
What a man!
He certainly put one over on you, Olentiev!
Get ready to set out, men.
Go, go!
Once again, once again!
You won!
- Where is Dersu?
- God knows.
He suddenly decided to take his portion of vodka and went off.
- He's sitting by the river.
- What's he doing?
Sitting by the fire and singing.
Probably drunk.
Let me tie it.
May I sit with you for a while, Dersu?
Captain.
Over there my wife and kids die.
Smallpox.
Everyone afraid of smallpox.
Wife, kids, house, all together burn.
Last night bad dream had.
Yurt will be soon fall down.
Wife, kids in this yurt... all get freezing.
No eat.
So me come here, give them everything.
Yesterday, an old men walked along.
This men didn't sleep the night.
- How do you know?
- No sign at camp fire that he sleep.
How do you know he's old?
Young man always walk on his toes.
Old man always walk on his heels.
I met that old Chinese a few days later.
His name is Li Tsung-ping.
He is 64.
He come from Tientsin.
How did he land here?
Was a woman.
His brother took her.
He went into the mountains.
For 40 years live alone.
Thank you.
It's cold already.
Maybe we should invite the old man to come over to our fire.
Don't, Captain.
Don't disturb him.
Him now think very much.
He see house, he see garden... all in blossom.
Captain! Captain!
Li Tsung-ping come say good-bye.
Him now go home.
The ultimate goal of this expedition... was to explore the area around Lake Khanka.
We had to cross bigs swamps and roadless tracts.
I sent most of the men and horses to Chernigovka.
Dersu, Olentiev, Krushinovandl... set out for the lake in a flatboat.
Olentiev, stay here and make camp.
Dersu and I will go on.
Unload.
Captain!
Us go back soon?
Me little scared.
Lake Khanka is not far.
We won't stay there long.
All right, Captain, you see for yourself.
What is okay is okay.
Silence layover the frozen reaches of the lake.
Some menace to humans was lurking in this silence.
Captain!
Have to go back quick.
The wind cover our tracks.
Yes, yes, let's go.
Never mind, Dersu.
Now we'll know where we came from.
From there!
Captain!
Us weren't here. Bad!
Captain! Us lose road!
Road there.
But how do we get there?
There is water all around.
Captain! Sun is low.
Soon night come.
Night come, we die.
If the camp is close by, they'll hear us.
We'll have to spend the night here, Dersu.
It's dangerous to go on.
What shall we do?
Captain! Listen.
Listen good.
Have to work fast.
Us not work good, us die.
- What work?
- Cut grass.
Captain! Work fast!
Captain! Work fast!
Captain! Must hold grass!
Take rope!
Captain! Get up! Get up!
As the wind howled,
I sank into darkness.
I don't know how long I slept.
Hey, bear!
Climb out of den!
Sun is up!
Only then did I realize what Dersu had done for me.
His witshad saved me.
Thank you, Dersu.
Thank you.
What would I have done without you?
Go together, work together.
No need thanks.
That's Olentiev!
From that point on... our expedition became more difficult.
Let's go! Go!
Severe frost.
Exhaustion.
Hunger.
Man is very small before the face of nature.
Forward! Forward! Don't stop!
Forward!
Captain!
Me find smell of smoke.
Udegheis are frying fish.
Thank you.
Captain.
Where go tomorrow?
We'll reach Chernigovka, join our men there... and then take the train to Vladivostok.
Come with me.
It's nice and comfortable in town.
No, thank you.
Me cannot.
What me work in town?
Hunting, no.
Sable chase, no.
At least come to the station with me.
I'll get food and some money for you there.
Me food, money not need.
Me now search sables.
Sables same money.
What's the matter, Dersu?
Me bad man.
Me want some cartridge.
Olentiev, give him everything that's left.
Thank you, Captain.
Me tomorrow go straight ahead.
Four suns go.
Find Daubikhe... then go Ulakhen... then Fujin.
Me heard... many, many sable there.
Deer too.
Me heard about it.
People around say.
Now me understand.
Good-bye, military men.
Farewell.
Good-bye, Dersu.
Maybe we'll meet again.
Good-bye, Captain.
Well...
Maybe we'll meet again.
Good-bye.
He's a fine man.
I never met anyone like him.
He's a rare man.
May God give him good health.
In the islands, the hunter
Roams all day long
But no luck for him
And he curses himseIf
What's he going to do
How is he to serve
He cannot be cheerful
So what
He'll try to aim better
So the hunter goes
To warmer waters
That spring... once again I set out to traveI across the Ussurii area.
Go! Go!
Where are you going?
To the left!
Careful! Look after the horses!
For three months, we have been walking in the forest.
Spring in the forest quickly gave way to summer.
We've explored a large area.
But if we had Dersu, we'd have accomplished more.
All this time,
I was thinking with anticipation... that maybe I would meet him again.
Where are you, Dersu?
Up the spring, go!
Faster, guys.
Bring the water.
Andriucha!
Throw up more branches!
What is taking so long?
Faster, faster! Don't smile!
And you said you would bring a boar!
Vladimir Pavlovich.
I met a hunter two miles from here.
He was asking about our unit-- who we are, who's the captain.
Did you tell him?
How could I, sir?
I know how to keep a military secret.
Eh, Turtygin, Turtygin.
Did he remain there?
No, sir. He started to collect his backpack.
Vladimir Pavlovich!
Your rifle!
- Hello, Captain!
- Hello, Dersu!
You are my dear man.
You haven't changed at all, Dersu.
Haven't changed.
Haven't grown older.
You, my eagle with blue-black wings
Where have you been flying for so long
How have you been these years?
Shot lots of sables?
Plenty.
- Get much money.
- Oh! That's good!
Only all this money go.
How come?
Rich trader me invite.
Much vodka.
Me give him money to keep for me.
After that, his men no where.
Why so?
Me don't understand.
You, my eagle with blue-black wings
Where have you been flying forso Iong
I was flying there over the mountains
Where it all was silence
Next morning, the forest was shrouded in thick fog.
We were leading the way.
I was confident because Dersu was now with me.
Dersu, what do you think?
Will the weather clear up?
Yes.
Earth and hill all sweating now.
Soon they'll get completely well.
Why are they lagging behind?
It's high time they catch up with us.
Let us wait.
Me lost pipe.
Me think pipe be near.
Must go back.
How I lose pipe?
Either got old... or my head got bad.
Look, Captain.
This is track tiger.
Him behind us go.
When us come here, was not track on road.
Him close here.
When us stopped over there, he was right here!
Me go back, tiger run away.
That is nothing, Captain.
Tiger never make big noise.
Excuse us, Captain, for lingering.
Two horses got stuck in the bog.
Is this your pipe, Dersu?
- What is it with you?
- There's a tiger nearby.
Hey, guys, careful!
A tiger's nearby!
Calm down!
Calm down, I say!
Come on, come on!
Again tiger go our track!
Why go behind?
What do you need, tiger?
What do you want?
Us go road, not bother you, and you go behind!
Is there not enough space in forest, tiger?
Let's go!
Why have you halted?
Looks like fallen trees there.
- Dersu, what's that?
- Ludiovo.
Ludiovo? And what's that?
Animals go to river, drink water.
Want to go round trunks and branches and fall into pit.
They catch animals, sell the skins.
Detail several men to follow me.
Belonozhkin, Zagourskii, Zakharov,
Bochkariov, follow me.
Careful.
Look here.
Look in the other pits.
Go.
Sir! A doe and two reindeer there.
Already dead.
Pasha, what do you have there?
I found two pits.
Only carrion in there.
What about you, Andriucha?
I fell in myself!
Vasia! Vasia!
- What's there?
- I found a whole flaying house!
- Who did it?
- Bad Chinese did this.
Why leave ludiovo, but not fill holes?
Bad to kill animals for nothing.
Bring axes and hoes here!
What happened, Dersu?
Hounhous! Chinese bandits!
They make holes in my shirt, and I make holes in theirs!
- How many are there?
- Eight.
Turtygin, two remain here.
The rest ofyou follow me.
They got away, the vipers.
Hounhous bad Chinese.
Bad.
Steal money, fur.
Steal wife, kill men.
Sir, here.
Hounhous steal three women.
Me not understand what they do with men.
Turtygin!
Hey, guys, come here quick!
Much mosquito, horsefly there.
By night your face like this.
Then much pain.
Then die.
Good us found at daytime.
Very, very good.
All alive.
I'll kill those Hounhous!
Hounhous!
That Chang Pao, not Hounhous!
My name's Chang Pao.
We fight Hounhous.
I'm Arseniev.
We're exploring this area.
- Hello.
- Hello.
They took the women with them, as always.
Hounhous go there.
Move, hurry!
Dersu, calm down.
They won't get far away.
Will you take care of these men?
Detachment, fall in.
Detachment, fall in.
In those places where they robbed and killed... people told us that the bandits are not more than ten.
We'll handle them ourselves.
Well, good luck then.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Danger no.
Hounhous end.
At first sight, this river seemed quiet and peaceful.
I sent some men with horses to look for a place to ford it.
I myself with the others tried to cross the river on a raft.
Stand here.
Let me.
Pull it!
Give me the weapons.
The pole! Where's the pole?
The pole! Throw it!
Come on! Do it!
Go along the bank, men!
Along the bank!
Run along the bank!
Get ahead of us! Ahead!
Run ahead!
Jump, Captain, jump!
Come on, come on!
- If we only had a rope!
- We used all the rope for the raft!
Cut down tree! Cut down!
- This one?
- No!
- This one?
- No!
- This one?
- Uh-huh!
Get the axes!
Tie the tree! Quick!
Tie the tree!
Take off your belts!
These will do too.
- We'll need levers.
- Cut them!
Hold on! Hold on!
Come on, guys, faster, faster!
How are you there?
Hold it!
Let it go little by little!
Go, go, go!
Hold it! Let go!
Dersu, give me your hand!
Grab me!
You were like a bear!
Summer end, Captain.
Autumn come.
That's good.
A bit to the left.
A bit to the left.
Good.
Okay, get ready.
Attention.
Hold it.
Good.
Turtygin, come here.
Now you take a picture of us.
Press here, okay?
My fondest memories of Dersu... are connected with the beginning of that autumn.
- What's wrong with that horse?
- Tiger.
Listen, tiger!
Soldiers fire rifle!
You go away. Go away!
What me do?
Kill tiger.
The tiger ran away.
He's unharmed.
No, tiger always run until die.
Now me much frightened.
Don't be afraid, Dersu.
A dead tiger can't harm you.
Kanga will!
He send another tiger!
Kanga is a forest spirit whom the Goldi worship.
From that day Dersu changed.
He became morose and irritabIe.
What you do?
That sign say no ginseng here.
You break.
People search for ginseng, all for nothing.
Bad man are you.
So he just jumped in the river in all his clothes. He was drunk.
In all his clothes!
And I had an adventure--
Why throw meat into fire?
Meat throw into fire, lose.
Tomorrow we go, other people here come... see meat, eat.
Who would come here?
How's that? Who come?
Badger come, marten come.
Crow come, mouse come.
All kinds of men in forest.
Good evening, Dersu.
I say, salute!
The Ussurii autumn is brief.
Winter colds come fast.
I started getting ready for winter... and sent some of the men with all our horses to Olga Bay.
Smells! Men here!
- What men?
- Boars!
I don't smell anything.
- Dersu, why didn't you shoot?
- I not see.
Why not me see boar?
My nose see better than eyes.
I did not know then... that this small incident was a fore runner of tragic events.
A stag!
Where, Captain?
Where?
There, under the half-fallen tree.
- Did I hit it?
- No.
Didn't you see it?
Everyone misses sometimes, Dersu.
Why me not hit it?
Captain! Before,
I always first see an animal!
Shoot, always hit target.
Now not hit.
Bad are my eyes.
How I live in forest now?
Come to Khabarovsk with me.
My home is your home.
New Year's Eve came.
It was a strange night.
The tiger come to kill me.
Thank you, Captain!
Thank you!
What happened, Dersu?
Captain, you say your home my home.
Thank you, Captain!
Will you come with me to my place?
My eyes get bad.
Kanga not want me to live in forest.
He send the tiger.
Probably what Dersu called the tiger... was the specter of his fear of the forest... conjured by the imagination... of a man grown old.
Listen here.
Vova recorded Dersu.
Well, well.
The Captain go hills, work.
Go back to city... sit at a table, write, work.
Me no work in the city.
Stare into fire.
Look at hills far away.
And that's it.
It's true.
He doesn't like the city.
Never mind.
He'll get used to it.
Vova, did Dersu hear it?
Yes.
- What did he say?
- He said, ''Right, not word miss.''
Does he often talk to you about the forest?
Yes. Dersu is not afraid of anything.
Neither of wolves, nor of boars, or of bears.
Snow storms and floods are nothing for him.
You know, Dersu is Vova's hero.
He is crazy about him.
And I owed him my life on several occasions.
He never mentioned it.
Well, he thinks it is quite a regular thing to do.
Most people like to boast about such things and exaggerate.
This men always with me roam the forest... many, many years.
This is a bear tooth... and claws.
And these are claws of lynx.
For you. Take.
You give it to me?
Yes, Little Captain.
Really?
I am so happy.
It will be my talisman.
Don't you have tiger claws?
Didn't you hunt a tiger?
I shoot at tiger but--
It bad to kill tiger.
Why?
Very... very bad.
Take this. Thank you.
Why give money for water?
Much water is in river.
- Why you take money for water?
- What?
You don't understand anything.
You are bad man!
- Where are you going?
- Shoot.
Don't even think of it! It's not allowed to shoot guns in a city.
In barrel much dirt.
Me shoot a bullet, clean barrel.
Then wipe with cloth, shoot well.
There are many people here.
It's dangerous.
Me fire not people.
Me fire at air.
All the same, you cannot.
The city isn't the same as the hills.
Do you understand?
Do you?
Well, how are you, Dersu?
Sit I here, just like duck.
How can men sit in box?
You are right.
It isn't a very nice room.
We'll have to change the wallpaper... make everything more cozy.
Meanwhile, what if you live in my study.
Don't bother, Captain.
I pitch tent outdoors.
Sleep.
I don't disturb anyone.
See, Dersu... it's not allowed in a city.
Why not?
Bad!
How should I explain?
That's a rule.
A rule.
Shoot a gun I can't.
Sleep outdoors I can't.
I not get enough air at all.
Pa, what happened?
Dersu's been arrested!
The police just called.
What is it again?
You know, he saw me buying firewood yesterday and grew very angry... and went to the city park to chop down a tree.
Please... let me go back to hills.
Live in city I cannot.
Where will you go?
To the hills.
Captain.
Missus.
Little Captain.
All fine people.
Me go-- bad!
But I cannot live in a city.
Here, take this rifle as a gift.
New model.
It's easy to aim.
Même avec une vue faible tu toucheras au but.
Thank you. Captain
To Mr Arseniev
Your visiting card found on dead goldi.
Request your presence to identify the body.
Police Headquerters.
Mr Arseniev ?
Did you know him ?
We were friends !
And his name was ?
- Dersu Uzala...
- His occupation ?
- A hunter.
- A hunter. How strange.
He didn't have a rifle.
There must have been.
A rifle of the latest model.
No, nothing was found... except your visiting card...
It's clear now : the criminal wanted the rifle so he killed the man.
- Ready Sir.
- The ground is frozen. It was hard digging the grave.
Bury him !
So now I'll ask you to sign.
Beg your pardon. I'm a busy man
Thank you.
So... May I leave ?
{169}{263}{Y:i}[Helicopter whirrs]
{1764}{1829}How are you, Mr Stevens?|Good to see you again.
{1834}{1901}Save some of that film for the official opening.
{1906}{1994}- It's gonna be a real wingding.|- When was the house built, Mr Stevens?
{1999}{2087}My father started it in 1916.|Took four years to complete it.
{2092}{2178}Whose idea was it to turn the estate|into a museum?
{2183}{2293}Mine. I've always wanted a place|where people could come and visit,
{2298}{2361}rest a while and look at beautiful things.
{2366}{2435}How long have you been collecting?
{2440}{2567}Let's see... Well, I guess|I've been collecting all my life.
{2572}{2664}I started out as a boy collecting stamps|and then I sold them.
{2669}{2719}Then I started collecting bicycles.
{2724}{2807}Then bicycles led to old cars.
{2812}{2875}Then one day I saw this painting.
{2880}{2967}It was a Renoir. I guess that did it.
{2972}{3068}That led to another|and then to another and to another.
{3073}{3187}Then after all these years I decided|it was time to share my collection
{3192}{3278}with anybody that might enjoy it,|give it to the people.
{3283}{3344}[Reporter] Will your prototype|executive aircraft revolutionise
{3349}{3398}the private and commercial industry?
{3403}{3447}[Stevens] I certainly hope so.
{3452}{3533}[Reporter] Will we be receiving a list|of the guests you've invited?
{3538}{3594}You'll all get a press kit.
{3599}{3669}What about the plane|that's bringing your guests?
{3674}{3729}You'll see the airplane when it arrives.
{3734}{3826}I think you'll agree that we brought|these guests down in style.
{4138}{4229}Dulles Tower, 2-3 Sierra Heayy,|out of 3,000 VFR for landing.
{7095}{7151}The emergency lights?
{7156}{7217}- Off.|- Beacon light off. Radios?
{7222}{7256}- Off.|- OK.
{7261}{7317}All righty, gents. She's all set for tonight.
{7322}{7375}Sorry I was late on those boost pumps.
{7380}{7441}Don't worry about it. See you guys later.
{7474}{7528}Why did you mention it? He didn't notice.
{7533}{7618}Are you kidding? Why do you think|Stevens hires a guy like him?
{7623}{7693}He notices everything.
{7741}{7790}Well, how did it check out?
{7795}{7855}Just beautiful. She behaved perfectly, Stan.
{7860}{7959}She damn well better.|I spent the best part of a year on this project.
{7964}{8013}Now Stevens has got his dream machine,
{8018}{8113}you can go back to that nice executive life|of two-hour lunches, golf...
{8118}{8174}I don't play golf.
{8179}{8265}Besides, the job won't be finished|until we deliver this baby tonight.
{8270}{8339}That's true. You're not gonna|light that thing, are you?
{8344}{8425}No, I've quit smoking. Well, I'm quitting.
{8506}{8633}{Y:i}[Woman on Tannoy] TWA Flight 34|now arriving at gate 26.
{8687}{8820}{Y:i}Passenger Dupree,|please pick up white courtesy phone.
{8968}{9021}[Phone rings]
{9175}{9279}{Y:i}All passengers holding tickets|on Pan American Flight 10
{9284}{9366}{Y:i}should be on board.
{9421}{9550}{Y:i}TWA Flight 36 now arriving at gate 37.
{9632}{9760}{Y:i}Passenger Troutman, please come|to the American Airlines ticket office.
{9765}{9814}{Y:i}All passengers holding tickets
{9819}{9893}{Y:i}on American Airlines Flight 12|should be on board.
{9898}{9951}- How's it going?|- OK.
{9978}{10050}- OK, thank you very much.|- Thank you.
{11149}{11218}Wonder which is worth more,|the cargo or the plane?
{11247}{11378}It's a toss-up. I'll bet that together|they're equal to the GNP of Texas.
{11906}{11971}Lafite Rothschild '45.|I didn't know there was any left.
{11976}{12081}- After tonight there won't be, Captain.|- [Men chuckle]
{12099}{12222}{Y:i}[Woman on Tannoy]...tickets on Pan American|Flight Four may proceed to the boarding area.
{13943}{14003}- Julie, where's Eve?|- In the office.
{14008}{14042}See you later.
{14376}{14411}Mm-hm.
{14416}{14537}- My problem is a fear of flying. What's yours?|- What makes you think I have a problem?
{14542}{14673}We've been living together longer|than most people are unhappily married.
{14678}{14782}- I don't think you can help me with this one.|- I can't help you?
{14787}{14868}You forget that I'm a pilot,|the symbol of strength and security.
{14873}{14945}Lightning may flash|and thunder may roar around my plane,
{14950}{15004}but when the biggie walks through the cabin,
{15009}{15111}little old ladies stop fingering their beads|and sweaty palms dry up.
{15116}{15191}Gallagher is at the controls.|No harm can come to anybody.
{15196}{15250}You tell me I can't help you.
{15255}{15337}- Stop talking and hold me.|- I can't do two things at once.
{15342}{15391}- Will you try?|- I'll try.
{15441}{15534}Listen, wouldn't it just be sensational
{15539}{15662}if after the festivities tonight|we announced that we were getting married?
{15700}{15796}Mr Stevens has asked me|to take over the Geneva office
{15801}{15862}for a year or longer,
{15867}{15950}and I think I might like to try that.
{15955}{16006}Well, I'll just get the job
{16011}{16082}flying the route from New York|to Paris to Geneva.
{16087}{16152}I'll see you once or maybe twice a week.
{16157}{16238}I can't think of a more solid basis|for a happy marriage.
{16243}{16345}- I've been through one divorce.|- That doesn't make you unique.
{16350}{16433}- Why can't we just keep it the way it is?|- No.
{16438}{16522}Because I want a wife and children.
{16552}{16640}Not necessarily in that order, but...
{16645}{16727}Until you make up your mind,|why don't you buy me lunch?
{16732}{16823}Yeah... You make more than I do.|We'll go Dutch.
{17489}{17538}- They've gone.|- Good.
{17543}{17617}Let's get moving. We're behind schedule.
{20983}{21019}Thanks, Julie.
{21024}{21109}Lisa, I'm so glad you're here.|I didn't think you were coming.
{21114}{21190}Me neither.|Benjy, you remember Eve, don't you?
{21195}{21264}Hello, Benjy. Your father'll be|so pleased to see you.
{21269}{21393}I wish the feeling were mutual.|I'm doing it for Benjy.
{21398}{21442}- You're just like your father.|- What?
{21447}{21496}Stubborn. Stubborn woman.
{21501}{21550}- Have you got everything, Dorothy?|- Yes.
{21555}{21604}Good.
{21737}{21813}- Get these stowed away.|- [Knocking]
{21818}{21917}Hey, help me get these things|stowed away for take-off.
{22031}{22079}Mrs Livingston, you look wonderful.
{22084}{22181}Is this plane as fantastic|as the newspapers say it is?
{22186}{22239}Come and see for yourself.
{22372}{22487}- Well, what do you think?|- It's magnificent.
{22492}{22542}Excuse me.
{22547}{22616}Dorothy, get comfortable.
{22621}{22679}And try to relax.
{22701}{22790}Have a drink. It'll do you good.
{22841}{22890}Emily.
{22919}{22990}- I hoped you'd be flying with us.|- You're missing a fourth.
{22995}{23076}She just arrived.|Come and sit down and join us.
{23081}{23133}- Dr Herbert Williams.|- How do you do?
{23138}{23189}- Gerald Lucas.|- How do you do?
{23194}{23271}Delighted to meet you.|I admire your sponsorship of young artists.
{23276}{23376}Unfortunately, I don't admire|your printed attacks on them.
{23403}{23462}My reviews are never meant personally.
{23467}{23551}Only a politician could have said that better.
{23556}{23651}Don't worry, gentlemen.|I declare a truce on all art critics.
{23656}{23722}But only for the duration of the flight.
{23727}{23821}Right now the name of the game is poker.
{23826}{23885}Five-card stud, ten-dollar ante.
{23890}{24025}No ceiling on raises and nothing is wild.|Any objections, boys?
{24079}{24159}- One of the nicest pictures I've ever seen.|- Did you hear that, Mommy?
{24163}{24233}Bonnie's class wrote to Mr Stevens|about their painting.
{24238}{24289}He asked them|to pick someone to bring it.
{24294}{24344}And they chose me.
{24349}{24431}Well, they couldn't have made a better choice.
{24436}{24547}Flight service, this is 2-3 Sierra Heayy.|Any weather updates?
{24552}{24641}{Y:i}[Over radio] Heavy frontal activity off|the Gulf Coast is continuing to build.
{24646}{24698}{Y:i}Better keep a pretty tight|schedule, Captain.
{24703}{24736}Roger and out.
{24741}{24792}May I have your attention, please?
{24797}{24900}I'd like to take a moment of your time|to acquaint you with our airplane.
{24905}{24956}You are now located in the main lounge.
{24961}{25033}Aft of our main lounge area,|we have the communication centre,
{25038}{25123}bedrooms and the library|with conference facilities.
{25128}{25217}Below, down the centre stairs,|we have our crew seating area,
{25222}{25285}cargo storage fore and aft,
{25290}{25399}and a complete galley capable of preparing|the most exotic of dishes.
{25404}{25517}Up the forward stairs, we have a small office|and, of course, the flight deck.
{25522}{25653}If there are any questions,|please, feel free to ask. Thank you.
{25752}{25853}2-3 Sierra, proceed to runway one niner right|and hold for clearance.
{25858}{25893}{Y:i}[Gallagher] Roger, Tower.
{26188}{26261}2-3 Sierra, you're next for take-off clearance.
{26266}{26305}[Gallagher] Roger, Tower. Thank you.
{26619}{26726}{Y:i}Good evening. I'm glad|you could join us in the inaugural flight
{26731}{26780}{Y:i}of the Stevens Corporation new airplane.
{26785}{26869}{Y:i}- I wish I could be with you, but...|- Who's that?
{26874}{26955}- That's your grandpa.|- Have I ever met him?
{26960}{27075}- Mm-hm. Once, when you were a little boy.|- How little?
{27080}{27125}About like that.
{27130}{27215}{Y:i}In the meantime,|have fun and enjoy the flight.
{27339}{27415}Good evening.|This is your pilot, Captain Gallagher.
{27420}{27520}{Y:i}Mr Stevens thought you might like|a plane's eye view of the take-off.
{27525}{27618}{Y:i}We'll be getting clearance momentarily,|so just sit back and enjoy yourselves.
{27623}{27681}{Y:i}[Tower controller] 2-3 Sierra,|you're cleared for take-off.
{27686}{27769}[Chambers] Roger, Tower. I understand.|Cleared for take-off.
{27873}{27922}[Chambers] We're rolling.
{28424}{28485}How fast can this plane go, Mommy?
{28490}{28556}Fast enough.
{28775}{28867}Grandpa sure has a neat plane,|doesn't he, Mom?
{28872}{28953}Grandfather has a lot of expensive toys.
{29110}{29159}Who's light?
{29298}{29489}{Y:i}# Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
{29495}{29636}{Y:i}# And that's what I want to do
{29679}{29857}{Y:i}# Hold you in my life forever
{29862}{29989}{Y:i}# And just keep on loving you
{30008}{30130}{Y:i}# Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder
{30208}{30327}{Y:i}# So take a special look and see
{30352}{30488}{Y:i}# And just possibly
{30493}{30786}{Y:i}# You'll see the beauty that's in me #
{31010}{31068}[girl] Come on! Come on!
{31169}{31204}Come on!
{31242}{31322}- I won!|- I guess you're just too good for me.
{31327}{31421}- I wanna play with Dorothy now.|- Are they getting the best of you?
{31426}{31481}I'm outclassed, that's all.
{31486}{31540}Bonnie, let's see if I can beat you.
{31884}{32024}[Man 1] This will be the last to go in.|[Man 2] Right. It's more complicated.
{32029}{32078}And the crew's quarters here?
{32083}{32195}You're talking about a ten-storey structure|that's gotta take the stress of the sea.
{32200}{32333}I'll show you the notes I made|at the last meeting with the architect.
{32338}{32463}You men are so lucky.|I wish I had a hobby like yours.
{32468}{32574}A plan that can harvest the seas for food|and save millions from starvation
{32579}{32642}can hardly be called a hobby.
{32647}{32731}I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to offend.
{32736}{32809}I can't imagine|what made me say a thing like that.
{32814}{32921}I hope you'll let me apologise. I do.|You know that I do. I'm terribly sorry.
{32926}{32987}- Mrs Wallace.|- Yes.
{32992}{33071}- How's the party?|- Party? What party?
{33076}{33141}Oh, I've found a hobby of my own.
{33146}{33195}Philip Stevens collects art.
{33200}{33265}I have now become|the foremost collector of toy booze.
{33270}{33390}Wait till you see this. I have a mini margarita.
{33395}{33460}And a teeny Martini.
{33465}{33511}Aren't they cute?
{33516}{33608}This is just about your size, Martin.
{33613}{33719}Come on. Drink with me.
{33776}{33845}Thank you, but I'll leave you to your collection.
{33850}{33931}- That was very good work, Frank.|- Very good.
{33936}{34041}I'll put it in with the rest of the presentation.|Excuse me.
{34080}{34129}Excuse me.
{34202}{34267}- Why do you treat him that way?|- He loves it.
{34272}{34334}Do you know how concerned he is about you?
{34339}{34420}I'm concerned about him.
{34425}{34505}I'm more concerned about him than you are.
{34510}{34595}You're the one|who seduced his wife, you know.
{34600}{34649}Yes, I know.
{34691}{34822}I'm lonely. I need someone|to be nice to me this week.
{34827}{34889}Can you be nice to me this week?
{34894}{34953}No, I don't think so.
{35263}{35322}What would Martin say if he knew about us?
{35327}{35398}I really don't think he'd mind, do you?
{35403}{35468}Do you? I'm gonna ask him.
{35473}{35514}- Karen.|- What?
{35519}{35603}- You're blackmailing me.|- Who else have I got to blackmail?
{35608}{35682}I don't get to fool around that much.
{35730}{35794}See you on the ground.
{36028}{36120}We're right on schedule, sir.|I don't think the weather'll be a problem.
{36125}{36204}Eve Clayton just walked in.|She has a message for you.
{36209}{36258}It's Mr Stevens.
{36340}{36408}- Hello, Philip?|- Eve, how are things going?
{36413}{36473}Everything is fine. Lisa and Benjy are here.
{36478}{36536}They're there? Well, that's wonderful.
{36541}{36633}I don't know how you did it,|but I thank you a million times.
{36638}{36714}You don't have to thank me.|She decided all by herself.
{36719}{36800}Isn't that wonderful?|I'll see you at the airport. Bye.
{36805}{36850}Goodbye.
{36855}{36947}Robert, get the car ready.|We're going to the airport.
{36952}{37001}And how about this?
{37006}{37122}Lisa and Benjy are coming home with me.
{37295}{37399}By the way, Captain,|I've been thinking about what you said.
{37404}{37454}So have I.
{37459}{37527}Can we talk about it in Palm Beach tonight?
{37532}{37597}I think that could be arranged.
{37602}{37651}Yeah.
{37912}{38017}We're right on schedule, but we have to|do something about that security guard.
{38022}{38093}Don't worry. When the time comes,|I'll take care of him.
{38168}{38235}Champagne on the rocks?
{38240}{38318}I haven't had that in years.|How did you know?
{38404}{38474}"Mr Nicholas St Downs III."
{38479}{38528}"London, 1936."
{38652}{38711}I don't believe it.
{38765}{38819}It IS Nicky.
{38863}{38912}I don't believe it.
{38917}{39003}After all these years and you turn up here.|Where have you been?
{39008}{39064}- London, mostly.|- And you know Philip?
{39069}{39161}Hard to work in the worlds of art and money|and not know him.
{39166}{39220}- And which world is yours?|- Both.
{39225}{39292}I arrange financing for a number of museums
{39297}{39390}and I've acquired|a modest collection of my own.
{39395}{39483}Would you care to see the present|I am taking to the museum?
{39488}{39532}I certainly would.
{39537}{39611}I don't know what I'd do if you'd said no.
{39674}{39717}How beautiful.
{39800}{39889}Oh, Nicky. It is good to see you.
{40108}{40152}Captain.
{40157}{40227}We have a low reading|for the middle cargo hold.
{40232}{40322}It is low. Maybe one of the sensors is out.
{40327}{40376}Buchek'll take a look at it.
{40442}{40482}Yeah?
{40487}{40565}- Mr Buchek, it's for you.|- Yeah?
{40570}{40635}I hear this is a special day for you, Eddie.
{40640}{40714}- The doctor said it's gonna be twins.|- I'll check right away.
{40719}{40775}Twins? You must be nervous.
{40780}{40846}No... terrified. It's the first time.
{40851}{40923}I see. Have you seen Mr Stevens' daughter?
{40942}{41021}She was upstairs in the office.|I sent her a drink.
{41026}{41134}- Do you mind if I call my wife?|- Please do.
{41139}{41213}- Larry, would you take over for me?|- Sure thing.
{41331}{41398}- That's OK.|- You shouldn't be down here, son.
{41403}{41474}That's all right. Benjy, how are you?
{41479}{41568}Close that hatch.|We'll check the pressure on this one.
{41619}{41670}What was that? My ears popped.
{41675}{41724}That's air pressure.
{41729}{41804}Each one of these holds|is airtight when it's sealed.
{41809}{41844}How come?
{41849}{41944}So we can carry all kinds|of different things in the cargos.
{41949}{41998}This ship's special.
{42061}{42153}{Y:i}- Captain Gallagher.|- The dumb indicator light was stuck.
{42158}{42240}{Y:i}- How's the reading now?|- Good. Thanks, Stan.
{42270}{42346}- Are you a real policeman, Mr Hunter?|- Sort of.
{42351}{42442}- Have you caught a lot of crooks?|- A few, but none lately.
{42447}{42507}Will you tell me about them?
{42512}{42621}- Sure. Any time.|- OK, Benjy. Hup, hup, hup!
{42872}{42943}Lisa, Lisa. What's wrong?
{42992}{43073}It's the same old story.|My father calls and I come running.
{43078}{43145}I think it's wonderful that you came.
{43150}{43240}He's missed you. Two years is a long time.
{43245}{43365}I know that. And in that time|I've made a life for myself and Benjy.
{43370}{43441}I'm finally someone|other than Philip Stevens' daughter.
{43446}{43530}All he ever wanted to do|was to try to help you.
{43535}{43584}I know that.
{43612}{43668}My father's a very powerful man.
{43673}{43784}I don't think he realises it, but he tends|to dominate everybody around him.
{43789}{43848}Especially me. But I'm going to tell him
{43853}{43938}that I'm finally living my own life,|once and for all.
{43943}{44015}This is a very important time for him.
{44020}{44076}Don't upset him, please.
{44081}{44141}I don't intend to upset him,
{44146}{44270}but I have to tell him how I feel,|whether it upsets him or not.
{44328}{44388}I don't think you should.
{44393}{44461}Your father's very ill.
{44466}{44542}The doctors say he has a few months,
{44547}{44596}maybe a little longer.
{44601}{44689}- That's impossible.|- No, it's true.
{44737}{44801}I'm sorry, darling.
{44832}{44899}Oh, my God, Eve.
{44968}{45027}It's time for me|to stretch my legs, Captain.
{45032}{45081}Right.
{45572}{45641}- [Woman 1] Tried the caviar?|- [Woman 2] No.
{46014}{46131}We've got ten minutes. The important thing|is to get Gallagher out of the cockpit.
{46136}{46185}Leave it to me.
{46312}{46425}The diving's the best part. You can't|imagine it if you haven't experienced it.
{46430}{46530}It's like exploring a world hidden from man|since the beginning of time.
{46535}{46584}It's beautiful, really beautiful.
{46589}{46650}I couldn't do that. Water terrifies me.
{46655}{46711}It shouldn't. It's wonderful down there.
{46716}{46812}In fact, it's about the only time|I ever really feel free.
{46817}{46872}Excuse me. I don't mean to intrude,
{46877}{46947}but could you move your ass, dear?
{47036}{47085}Thank you!
{47160}{47215}That was very cruel.
{47220}{47316}If I weren't cruel,|how would people know how kind you are?
{47321}{47461}If I weren't a sinner, how could you look|like a saint? Isn't that why we're together?
{47466}{47545}If it isn't, tell me.|I'll stop acting like such an idiot.
{47550}{47636}Why should I, my dear?|You're so proficient at it.
{48242}{48281}- Forget it.|- What?
{48286}{48350}You hit him too hard. He's dead.
{48437}{48511}Come on. Let's get him outta here.
{49776}{49810}Captain Gallagher.
{49815}{49894}This is the flight steward. I'm in the bedroom.
{49899}{49962}- You'd better come back here.|- What's your problem?
{49967}{50039}It's one of the passengers, sir.|He seems very ill.
{50044}{50093}I'll be right there.
{50149}{50231}One of the passengers isn't feeling well.
{51879}{52020}[Chattering and laughter]
{52384}{52433}Nicky?

{52829}{52904}[Coughing and spluttering]
{53241}{53357}[Clock ticking]
{54536}{54625}There's no time for that.|Get down to the cargo hold.
{55004}{55096}- How are we doing?|- Fine. Get him outta here.
{55101}{55190}Time for us to duck|under the radar scan and vanish.
{55961}{56069}Flight 2-3 Sierra is about to disappear|into the Bermuda Triangle.
{56811}{56877}Something's wrong.
{56882}{56990}- You having problems with that repeater?|- No, it's just not here.
{56995}{57082}- I've lost contact with 2-3 Sierra.|- Hang on.
{57145}{57236}They're in the Bermuda Triangle.|I'll try to contact them by radio.
{57367}{57457}{Y:i}[Man] 2-3 Sierra,|this is Palm Beach Approach. Do you read?
{57484}{57550}{Y:i}- We can lose these now.|- We have lost radar contact.
{57555}{57665}[Chuckles] Home free. In 20 minutes|we'll be on St George Island.
{57670}{57737}- Any problem on that end?|- Why should there be?
{57742}{57802}The airstrip hasn't been used|since World War II.
{57807}{57889}We'll have to make the transfer|before those people wake up.
{57894}{57943}Relax. They'll find themselves
{57948}{58018}sitting on an empty 747|wondering what happened,
{58023}{58093}[chuckles] and we'll be halfway|to South America.
{58675}{58731}Yes, I'll speak to Mr Stevens.
{58736}{58819}Phil, Herb Corrigan.|We have aircraft and ships
{58824}{58909}heading to the point|where the 747 disappeared.
{58914}{58992}- I'll be waiting right here.|- You're welcome to join us.
{58997}{59049}We're monitoring the coastguard search too.
{59054}{59137}I'll get out there as quick as I can.|Thanks, Herb.
{59237}{59346}Nayy Search Base, this is Nayy Search Three.|On station. Over.
{59351}{59423}{Y:i}[Man on radio] Navy Search Three, this is|Navy Search Base. Roger. Out.
{59496}{59600}Nayy Search Base, this is Coastguard|Cutter Venture on course to search area.

{60034}{60105}- Any chance of them spotting us?|- Not a chance.
{60110}{60204}We're headed away from them|at 600 miles an hour.
{60252}{60321}I'd better help Banker.
{60410}{60459}Thank you.
{60502}{60572}This weather front's going to limit|the air operation's effectiveness.
{60577}{60688}We need more ships.|Get me CINCLANT Fleet Operations.

{61765}{61814}Oh, yeah.
{64498}{64617}What is it? What the hell happened?

{65307}{65347}[Screams] Bonnie!
{65689}{65775}Bonnie. Come on.
{65780}{65849}- Oh, my God!|- Face the rear of the plane.
{65854}{65962}- What's happening?|- Put anything solid behind your back.
{65967}{66046}- Get down.|- Back inside.

{67716}{67779}Jesus Christ. Give me a hand here.
{67784}{67864}Move it. Move it!
{67869}{67929}- Is it broken?|- I think it's broken.
{67934}{67985}- Kid, take it easy.|- All right, honey.
{67990}{68060}- Oh, my God! Bonnie!|- She's OK.
{68115}{68189}- Don't move her.|- Keep her still.
{68218}{68271}[Girl crying]
{68276}{68334}Oh, my God. Look.
{68365}{68414}Look!
{68478}{68533}Look.
{68574}{68618}Look!
{68818}{68859}[Woman] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
{69015}{69092}- Hold on!|- [Screaming and sobbing]
{69622}{69668}Look out!
{69953}{70033}Don't panic. The emergency lights|come on automatically.
{70038}{70131}- The life jackets!|- No! Forget the life jackets.
{70136}{70194}- We can't open the door.|- We're gonna drown.
{70199}{70289}- Nobody is going to drown.|- Have you radioed for help?
{70294}{70405}Radios don't work underwater,|but they know exactly where we went down.
{70410}{70503}- What if we run out of air before...|- Calm down. I said calm down!
{70508}{70608}Everybody. People are seriously injured|and they need our help.
{70613}{70659}Get pillows, blankets, sheets,
{70664}{70730}anything that will make the injured|more comfortable.
{70735}{70784}- Where's that Dr...|- Williams.
{70789}{70849}Here, Captain.
{70854}{70913}There's a little girl that's pretty bad off.
{70918}{70965}Put a tourniquet on this man's arm.
{70970}{71068}See if you can move that piano.|Give me your belt.
{71073}{71166}Goddamnit! How could you let|a thing like this happen to us?
{71171}{71242}- How could you?|- Stan, give me your belt.
{71324}{71380}Don, what in hell happened?
{71385}{71464}I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.|You check the damage.
{71469}{71518}Sir, could you hold this tight?
{71523}{71605}Every five minutes let it go|and then do it again.
{71681}{71760}Sir, I'm gonna need a little help.|Can you come with me?
{71765}{71878}- Will you be all right here?|- Of course. Go with him, Nicky.
{71883}{71932}Thank you.
{72059}{72123}The children, are they all right?
{72128}{72177}Yes, they're fine.
{72215}{72277}Now, you just lie back
{72282}{72389}and let me take care of you.
{72394}{72467}Oh, Jesus, no! Where's Benjy? Oh, God!
{72472}{72561}He's down below in the main cabin.|He is all right.
{72598}{72704}- My God. What's going on here?|- We crashed.
{72709}{72758}- We crashed?|- Yes, we crashed.
{72763}{72851}People down below are seriously injured.|We've got to help them.
{72856}{72952}- I'm too frightened.|- We're all frightened, but we can't show it.
{72957}{73018}We're gonna have a panic on our hands.
{73023}{73116}The people down below need your help.
{73121}{73168}So do I.
{73292}{73362}- I'll try.|- You'll do it.
{73427}{73476}Come on.
{73616}{73685}You'll be all right.
{73751}{73800}Oh, my God.
{74197}{74248}OK.
{74431}{74497}- Do you need any help?|- Yeah.
{74502}{74587}Help me get this bastard into the office.
{74806}{74857}How badly is she hurt, Doctor?
{74862}{74948}She has internal injuries,|how extensive I'm not sure.
{74953}{75080}- Let's put her over here.|- [Woman whimpering]
{75193}{75307}No leaks so far, but it was never built|to withstand this much outside pressure.
{75312}{75390}- How long will it last?|- Who knows?
{75395}{75480}Till the rescue units get here?
{75485}{75577}- I hope.|- [Man groaning]
{75582}{75642}Somebody... help me.
{75812}{75864}Christ, Mr Buchek. I'm glad to see you.
{75869}{75960}My God. Give me a hand with that.
{75965}{76032}[Buchek] It's gonna hurt a little, Eddie.|Hang on.
{76037}{76082}- Easy.|- Ow!
{76087}{76173}- You said it was only gonna hurt a little.|- You got a knife?
{76178}{76239}- [Buchek] Take it easy.|- Hold still.
{76244}{76332}This won't hurt.|I'm only gonna cut your trouser leg.
{76337}{76400}But hold still, please.
{76447}{76500}You got it?
{76505}{76558}Oh, Jesus!
{76563}{76622}- Oh, boy.|- That ain't good.
{76667}{76723}- Just lie still.|- We need some help.
{76728}{76813}- I'll get somebody to help you.|- See if you can find that doctor.
{76818}{76875}His pupil dilation's fine.
{76880}{76959}It's probably a concussion.|He should come around.
{76964}{77045}He's got a hell of a lot of explaining to do.
{77050}{77109}Doc, you come with me.
{77235}{77302}- What's the condition of the fuselage?|- Doc...
{77307}{77355}Eddie is in the communications room.
{77360}{77440}His leg is smashed to hell.|See if you can help him.
{77445}{77500}[Man] It's not good.
{77505}{77561}[Woman] Why don't we put on the life jackets?
{77566}{77624}- How is he?|- OK.
{77653}{77707}- I'm gonna need your help.|- Sure.
{77712}{77781}Let's see if we can find a bottle of whisky.
{77921}{78006}Karen, it's going to be all right.
{78084}{78162}I promise you, it's going to be all right.
{78167}{78274}Don't leave me just for a minute.|Just don't leave me alone.
{78279}{78332}But there are injured people who need help.
{78337}{78450}Well, you're supposed to take care of me.
{78455}{78558}I mean... What's going to happen to me?
{78661}{78761}I'm sorry, my dear, but... the doctor needs me.
{79020}{79079}No, it's back aft here.
{79117}{79166}There. There we go.
{79213}{79268}Let's see what we got here, now.
{79273}{79351}Electric storage cell, no.|Interrupted service. Here we are.
{79356}{79438}CM-1, CM-2... CD-1. That's it.
{79465}{79505}[Water gurgling]
{79510}{79571}Oh, my God.
{79823}{79867}Oh, boy.
{79872}{79921}Look at this.
{80583}{80664}- It's cold all the way to the top.|- Completely flooded.
{80669}{80738}Better check the rear cargo holds.
{80879}{80929}Do you want some more water?
{80934}{80996}- Yeah, please.|- OK.
{81057}{81106}- Julie?|- Yes?
{81387}{81436}I love you, Julie.
{81589}{81625}Here.
{82209}{82258}Steve.
{82322}{82360}Steve.
{83344}{83406}- That doesn't seem to be flooded.|- Seem?
{83515}{83574}Let's hope you're right.
{84234}{84322}- Looks dry.|- Yeah, for now.
{84327}{84374}How long can she stand the pressure?
{84379}{84471}Who the hell knows? I just hope|it doesn't slide down any deeper.
{84476}{84600}Any increase in pressure'll crush this fuselage|like an empty beer can.
{84605}{84713}And the lack of a fresh air supply, oxygen,
{84718}{84811}that could become a very big factor.
{84816}{84899}Captain,|the copilot's regained consciousness.
{85065}{85119}- Mama.|- Yes, darling?
{85124}{85185}Is Bonnie gonna die?
{85190}{85244}No, love.
{85249}{85298}She looks real sick.
{85303}{85381}I know, but she's gonna be all right.
{85386}{85445}You'll see. Come here.
{85535}{85600}Is that all of it?
{85605}{85685}- Just about.|- Just about.
{85690}{85785}Coastal radar did have a fix on us|before the crash, didn't they?
{85790}{85905}No. We were too low for radar interception.
{85949}{86032}It's fortunate that you are injured,|you miserable son of a bitch!
{86037}{86121}I'd take you apart... Get him down below.
{86126}{86177}Come on.
{86208}{86257}What did you mean about the radar?
{86262}{86357}Chambers flew us off course.|The search planes'll never look for us here.
{86362}{86461}- There's no chance they'll find us?|- We're on our own.
{86643}{86737}And that is the total situation|as of this moment.
{86742}{86786}I'm glad you came down here.
{86791}{86886}I'll act as liaison|between my company and the nayy.
{86891}{86955}I'll bring Mr Stevens up to date.
{87008}{87090}Phil, let's take a walk and get some fresh air.
{87217}{87284}[Stevens] Do you think there's|a chance, Joe?
{87289}{87348}[Patroni] Between the nayy|and the coastguard,
{87353}{87451}there are twenty planes|and six ships out there.
{87456}{87572}The area where they think the plane went|down is covered. The search is expanding.
{87577}{87634}[Stevens] So far they've|come up with nothing.
{87639}{87703}[Patroni] If there are survivors,|they're gonna find 'em.
{87708}{87771}My daughter and my grandson|are on that plane,
{87776}{87830}you know that?
{87835}{87911}I have a picture of her here.
{87982}{88046}- She's a beautiful girl.|- She is.
{88095}{88172}I only hope there'll... there'll be a miracle
{88177}{88254}and I'll have a chance to see her again.
{88259}{88315}They'll just keep searching, Phil.
{88320}{88401}They'll keep searching.
{88563}{88612}- Go ahead.|- OK, I'm through.
{88644}{88711}[Indistinct chatter]
{88725}{88774}Would you move, please?
{88779}{88833}- Please move.|- Hold on.
{88838}{88933}- Julie, dear, would you move, please?|- Come on.
{88938}{89005}[Frank] I got him. Let go.
{89049}{89120}How is he?
{89125}{89205}It's a bad fracture, but I think he'll be OK.
{89210}{89261}You don't sound too sure.
{89266}{89349}Although there are similarities,|this isn't my usual line of work.
{89354}{89427}You see, I'm a doctor of veterinary medicine.
{89432}{89516}I look after the horses|at Mr Stevens' racing stables.
{89521}{89598}Maybe we ought to keep that|to ourselves, Anne.
{89616}{89666}Whatever you say, Doctor.
{89826}{89887}[Gallagher] This way. Where is it? Right here.
{89892}{89967}Ah, here we go. Where is the E-15 circuit?
{89972}{90096}[Buchek] The E-15 circuit breaks|right through the bulkhead right here.
{90101}{90180}[Creaking]
{90249}{90307}Oh, God.
{90427}{90486}I'll be right back.
{91730}{91774}- It's started.|- How bad?
{91779}{91871}- Bad. How we doing here?|- Take a look at 57-W.
{92140}{92207}[Woman whimpering]
{92212}{92269}What's the matter?
{92274}{92394}- Listen. Did you hear that?|- [Faint whispering]
{92424}{92488}No. I don't hear anything.
{92638}{92702}Everyone be quiet for a second.
{92756}{92820}Listen.
{92952}{93029}- What's that sound?|- Quiet. Listen.
{93148}{93245}[Engine running]
{93451}{93545}- It sounds like a ship.|- They're coming for us!
{93550}{93669}- [Woman 1] Thank God!|- [Woman 2] Thank God, they're coming for us!
{94290}{94359}[Engine fades]
{94707}{94845}- [Sighs] It's gone.|- It can't be.
{94850}{94914}It just can't be.
{94919}{95016}How could they leave us like this?|How could they?
{95037}{95105}- I don't know.|- Lisa...
{95110}{95189}I know. Because they never even saw us.
{95194}{95270}It's a passing ship.|They didn't even know we were here.
{95275}{95319}- That's enough.|- Nobody does.
{95324}{95422}- I said that's enough!|- More than enough, Mr Gallagher.
{95427}{95500}Goddamn mess we're in.
{95505}{95576}I think it's time we took a crack at this.
{95760}{95811}Is she any better?
{95816}{95876}Her temperature's gone even higher.
{95881}{95946}Isn't there something we could do?
{96426}{96496}E-15... Here.
{96535}{96611}Let's see. Yeah, that's E-15 all right.
{96616}{96707}- Can that circuit be jumped?|- Well, sure, it can be jumped.
{96712}{96817}But what worries me is whether|that bulkhead can withstand the pressure.
{96822}{96938}If we don't get a man up to send|a mayday signal, they'll never find us.
{96943}{97029}You're right. Some choice we got.
{97034}{97109}Either we all drown or we all suffocate.
{97114}{97161}- Come on.|- [Roaring crash]
{97590}{97644}OK, everybody. Quickly, please.
{97649}{97712}Settle down and listen very closely.
{97717}{97785}This raft has got a small built-in radio
{97790}{97867}that activates|when the raft hits the surface of the water.
{97872}{97940}It's gonna send a distress signal.
{97945}{98044}On the surface of the water?|A lot of good that does us down here.
{98049}{98099}Well, you're right, aren't you?
{98104}{98181}We have to get the raft out of the plane.
{98186}{98266}One door opens in,|in the rear cargo section.
{98271}{98340}- We can open it electrically.|- Won't that flood the plane?
{98345}{98449}No. There's a sealed door|between the cargo hold and here.
{98454}{98533}If the bulkheads don't give way,|that's the only place it'll flood.
{98538}{98587}I'll be in the hall with this oxygen.
{98592}{98690}If I can get the raft out,|get that damn thing up and inflated,
{98695}{98744}the search parties'll hear it.
{98749}{98804}- That's about it. Let's go.|- Captain.
{98809}{98869}- [Wallace] I think I should go with you.|- No.
{98874}{98923}I'm an experienced scuba-diver.
{98928}{99005}Two men have a better chance|of making it than one.
{99010}{99080}[Buchek] He's right, Don.
{99112}{99203}Go up in the cockpit,|get another one of these rigs and join us.
{99208}{99269}It's in the starboard locker.|Get a couple of life jackets.
{99274}{99338}[Worried chatter]
{99533}{99598}Put that wire on the blue terminal.
{99603}{99671}OK.
{99676}{99770}- How much more?|- Not much. Just one more wire.
{99775}{99901}Nothing I say will make any difference. Why?
{99906}{99972}Let the pilot go. Why are you taking a chance?
{99977}{100100}- I'm doing this for all of us.|- We're us!
{100105}{100170}They're a bunch of strangers.|You think everybody is us.
{100175}{100262}Can't you forget about other people|and think about yourself?
{100267}{100369}Other people thinking about themselves|got us down here in the first place.
{100455}{100520}You've got a lot of brains, Martin,
{100525}{100593}but you're not a smart man.
{100899}{100958}Help me off with this.
{101032}{101115}Careful with that one.
{101120}{101192}- You've got it.|- OK. Now...
{101252}{101315}I touch those together and that should do it?
{101320}{101426}- That ought to do it.|- Then we do it now.
{101577}{101660}Look, we have a date tonight in Palm Beach,
{101665}{101714}so you take care of yourself.
{101719}{101768}Promise.
{102221}{102276}There really isn't much more to say.
{102281}{102341}There's a hell of lot more to say.
{102346}{102420}There just isn't time enough to say it.
{102583}{102632}You all set?
{102695}{102753}Get up against this bulkhead
{102758}{102813}and stay as flat as you can.
{102818}{102862}When that damn door opens,
{102867}{102963}you're gonna think|the gates of hell came open.
{103048}{103112}We've only got two minutes of air.
{103166}{103229}Here we go.
{103436}{103473}[Buzzing]
{103698}{103754}[Buzzing]
{104052}{104096}What's wrong?
{104101}{104175}Must be a short in one of those damn wires.
{104209}{104246}[Creaking]
{104311}{104360}Don't get too close to the door.
{107119}{107208}Mrs Wallace, come away from the window.
{107213}{107282}Lay her back.|Get her something to drink.
{108579}{108663}[Emily] Look. He's made it.
{109116}{109201}Here, have some more. Easy. Here.
{109206}{109265}Come on, drink it.
{109373}{109473}- Take it easy.|- [Sobbing]
{109532}{109594}OK, Frank.
{109649}{109700}[Whispering] There you go. Easy, now.
{109705}{109770}All right. Easy, Mrs Wallace.
{109852}{109932}[Gasping]
{110331}{110422}{Y:i}[Beeping on radio]
{110473}{110526}We have a beeper!
{110531}{110582}Nayy Search Five, this is Nayy Search Base.
{110587}{110708}{Y:i}We have an emergency beeper|at 27 degrees north, 65 degrees west.
{110713}{110779}{Y:i}- Proceed and investigate.|- This is Nayy Search Five.
{110784}{110833}Wilco. Out.
{110944}{111051}{Y:i}[Beeping on radio continues]
{111255}{111320}200 miles off course? That's incredible.
{111325}{111387}{Y:i}- What ships are in that area?|- Agerholm and Cayuga.
{111392}{111451}- They're not part of our operation.|- They are now.
{111456}{111509}Get me Admiral James at CINCLANT Fleet.
{111514}{111563}- And check the coastguard.|- Aye aye, sir.
{111695}{111749}Isn't there something I can do to help?
{111754}{111813}How's your breast-stroke?
{111947}{112063}- [Reassuring whispering]|- [Woman crying]
{112733}{112777}- Mrs Wallace?|- I have to leave.
{112782}{112883}Why? If you open that door,|you'll hurt a lot of people.
{112888}{112979}Please, don't... Don't do that!
{112984}{113022}God!
{113062}{113106}[Woman] Stop it!
{113111}{113180}Take your hand off that door.
{113185}{113234}Listen to me.
{113276}{113322}Stop it!
{113327}{113387}Someone help them!
{113406}{113488}Oh, my God!
{113913}{113990}Look at that. There it is.
{114065}{114149}Hey, looks like we've got a survivor in a raft.
{114352}{114455}[Gallagher] Come on, baby. Come on! Yes!
{114460}{114509}Yeah!
{114559}{114625}Give me a wag! Atta way!
{114630}{114697}{Y:i}Navy Search Base,|this is Navy Search Five. Over.
{114702}{114755}This is Nayy Search Base. Go ahead.
{114760}{114826}Have located the aircraft at coordinates given.
{114831}{114903}One man in a life raft.|No other survivors sighted.
{114908}{115005}{Y:i}- Aircraft is completely submerged.|- Is the fuselage still intact?
{115010}{115118}{Y:i}- Roger. Appears to be.|- I want this to be a first-stage alert.
{115123}{115213}Get me helos, scuba teams,|compressors, air-hose packages, the works.
{115218}{115299}I want this treated like|an emergency sub-salvage operation.
{115304}{115389}{Y:i}Get me the captain of Cayuga|on a voice circuit.
{115525}{115605}{Y:i}- This is Captain Guay.|- I'm sure you know why I'm calling.
{115610}{115712}Yes, sir. We're prepared|to take that man on board.
{115717}{115762}We have a UDT team,
{115767}{115846}{Y:i}but we'll need additional equipment|and more divers.
{115851}{115915}{Y:i}- What is your ETA?|- Less than half an hour.
{115920}{116044}{Y:i}I would like to embark the aircraft owner|on Cayuga. Do you concur?
{116049}{116132}- We'll be happy to have him aboard.|- Thank you, Captain.
{116137}{116235}Phil, we can get you out there|by helo immediately. You too, Joe.
{116240}{116307}No, I'll be of more use here, Admiral.
{116312}{116377}They're gonna need the specs|on that plane's stress points.
{116382}{116447}Get Mr Patroni a direct line to his company.
{116452}{116559}{Y:i}And he'll need to be in constant contact|with Cayuga.
{116564}{116635}- This way, Mr Patroni.|- We'll get that plane up.
{116640}{116721}And in one piece.

{119141}{119237}- Buchek.|- We've got to move Dorothy.

{119441}{119513}Get her in the back of the plane.|Quick, move it.
{119518}{119572}[Man] Don't worry.
{119577}{119636}I got her head.
{119659}{119731}- Hurry it up.|- Easy. Take it easy.
{120047}{120124}Sir. I have contact out there, sir.
{120291}{120333}OK.
{120394}{120499}Lookout reports we have a life raft|off the starboard bow.
{120504}{120590}Come right and prepare to put a boat|in the water.
{120595}{120679}- Aye aye, sir. Right, full rudder.|- Aye aye, sir.

{121639}{121708}Thanks. Am I glad to see you guys!
{121713}{121772}Hang on. Here we go.
{122116}{122198}{Y:i}[Tannoy] Raise the stern ramp.
{122203}{122267}Don't let it slip.
{122347}{122396}{Y:i}[Tannoy] Stand by.
{122639}{122683}Let's get down there.
{122713}{122773}- Mr Gallagher, the pilot.|- Are you all right?
{122778}{122827}- Yes, sir. I'm fine.|- What's the situation?
{122832}{122909}Most of the passengers are alive,|but that fuselage is gonna give way.
{122914}{122963}- Air?|- They've been down there too long.
{122968}{123046}We'll get this rescue operation going.|Get him some dry clothes.
{123051}{123093}- Thank you.|- Main line.
{123098}{123122}Aye aye, sir.
{123216}{123301}[Panicky screams]
{123506}{123611}Eve, Powers, come here.|Distribute these to the passengers.
{123616}{123675}- One at a time.|- They slip over the head.
{123680}{123760}Make sure they're secured tightly.
{123765}{123882}As far as the other stress points go,|watch out for sections 5-B and 9-L.
{123887}{123934}{Y:i}They can't take much torque.
{123939}{124011}We're keeping a line open at this end.
{124016}{124078}Don, I don't need to tell you the risk factor
{124083}{124134}{Y:i}of getting the plane up in one piece.
{124139}{124234}{Y:i}It could split wide open at any time.|Take care and good luck.
{124239}{124285}Thanks, Joe.
{125016}{125107}- My daughter and grandson...|- They weren't injured, sir.
{125112}{125171}We're gonna raise the plane|with salvage pontoons.
{125176}{125244}Lieutenant Norris will lead the UDT team.
{125249}{125293}- I'll go with them.|- You a diver?
{125298}{125352}- Amateur.|- I'm not sure I can permit that.
{125357}{125433}Your men don't know|the stress points of a 747.
{125438}{125526}Attach the pontoons in the wrong place,|that ship'll crack wide open.
{125531}{125603}You need me down there.
{125656}{125707}Get this man into some scuba gear.
{125712}{125756}Right this way.
{126263}{126333}- Grab the stern line.|- I got it.
{126338}{126382}Stand clear of the airline.
{126500}{126549}I got you.
{126579}{126632}Play it out easy.
{126831}{126880}Hook it up.
{126890}{126942}Easy does it.
{126981}{127040}The main damage is in the forward cargo hold.
{127045}{127092}Can we get air to the passengers?
{127097}{127181}Too risky. You can't cut through|that thin aluminum.
{127186}{127235}OK, let's get going.
{127342}{127393}The captain's gotta be kidding.
{127398}{127469}He thinks we're gonna attach|some air balloons to that 747
{127474}{127534}and it's gonna float right up to the surface.
{127539}{127643}- It's gonna blow up like a bomb going off.|- They gotta try something.
{127648}{127697}Those people'll die from lack of oxygen.
{127702}{127777}Don't bet anything on their chances|with this balloon routine.
{128598}{128650}- All set, sir?|- I'm ready.
{128655}{128719}All right, let's go. Over the side.
{129655}{129742}There's divers out there. They're coming for us.
{129747}{129865}- What did he say?|- Where? I can't see them. Move over.
{129870}{129937}There they are.
{130106}{130159}They're gonna try and raise the plane.
{130164}{130224}It's gonna be like a tidal wave.
{130229}{130292}Grab anything solid|you can get your hands on.
{130297}{130341}Grab that companion-way rail.
{130346}{130412}Use your belts. Strap yourselves in.
{130417}{130510}Doctor, get that child up here|by the pong table.
{130515}{130582}Move it out. Come on.
{132731}{132802}[Gushing water]
{134923}{134972}Here, grab this.

{136880}{136960}[Scraping]
{137581}{137627}- Here's number one line.|- Number two.
{137632}{137662}Got it?
{137667}{137716}OK, take it on down.
{138854}{138952}[Creaking]
{139490}{139545}Captain Guay.
{139550}{139613}- Go ahead, Norris.|- Plane's leaking like a sieve.
{139618}{139691}- Gallagher says it's now or never.|- What about the weight distribution?
{139696}{139750}It's gonna come up at a steep angle.
{139755}{139841}{Y:i}- Any way to equalise the load?|- No, sir.
{139846}{139902}Let's get those boats out of the way.
{139907}{139982}We're gonna have to chance it.
{139987}{140036}Let's go.
{140431}{140509}Hold on to me, Dorothy.
{140541}{140606}It'll be all right.
{140986}{141076}The boats have pulled back a safe distance.|We can start.
{141081}{141140}Start the compressor.

{145939}{146027}Somebody help him!
{146069}{146177}I got him! It's all right. Hold on to me.
{146576}{146640}Increase the pressure.
{146903}{146945}My God.
{147150}{147199}Get ready!
{147445}{147495}We made it.
{147556}{147630}[Cries of relief]
{147907}{147956}Let's go!
{148117}{148169}Better get those people out fast.
{148174}{148256}That plane could go down|as quick as it came up.
{148261}{148351}You're safe. You're going to be all right.
{148380}{148410}Dorothy?
{148434}{148480}Dorothy?
{148822}{148885}Let's get out of here.
{148904}{148957}Take your shoes off!
{148962}{149025}We'll disembark in the following manner.
{149030}{149116}The injured first, then the children, women|and finally the men.

{149212}{149281}I'll take the kid.
{149286}{149335}Watch out!
{149528}{149589}Inflate your life jackets before getting out!
{149594}{149652}Wait for the boats!
{149657}{149706}Come on in!
{149860}{149931}All right, step on it.
{150380}{150458}Let's get 'em on that boat.

{150616}{150682}Oh... God!
{151251}{151325}Put her over there.
{151330}{151363}Come on.
{151545}{151621}Careful. Careful!
{151676}{151725}Sir.
{151750}{151798}OK.
{151803}{151866}Get them in life jackets!

{158245}{158319}You'd better. You got a date with me tonight.
{158417}{158466}I love you.
{158584}{158633}I love you.
His name was Jeremiah Johnson.
They say he wanted to be a mountain man.
The story goes that he was a man of proper wit and adventurous spirit... suited to the mountains.
Nobody knows where he came from, and it don't seem to matter much.
He was a young man... and ghosty stories about the tall hills didn't scare him none.
He was looking for e Hewkin gun,
50 caliber or better.
He settled for e 30, but damn, it was e genuine Hewkin.
You couldn't do no better.
Bought a horse, traps and other truck that went with being a mountain man.
And said goodbye to whatever life was down below.
Where is it I could find bear, beaver, other critters worth cash skinned?
Ride due west as the sun sets.
Turn left at the Rocky Mountains.
This here 's his story.
"I, Hatchet Jack..." being of sound mind and broken legs... do hereby leaveth my bear rifle... to whatever finds it.
Lord hope it be a white man.
It is a good rifle... and killed the bear that killed me.
Anyway, I am dead.
"Yours truly, Hatchet Jack."
Ha, ha!
A 50 caliber Hawkin!
Come on, you.
That'll be far enough, pilgrim!
Where are you?
You're a fine target, pilgrim!
Empty your hand.
I ain't seen no live man in 2 months.
I am Bear Claw Chris Lapp.
Blood kin to the grizzly that bit Jim Bridger's ass!
You are molesting my hunt!
- I am...
- I know who you are!
You're the same dumb pilgrim
I've been hearing for 20 days... and smelling for 3!
How come you ain't been scalped?
Ain't been too lucky?
- No.
- This place has been trapped out since '25.
Why are you here?
I hunt griz.
- Griz?
- Grizzly bears, pilgrim. I collect the claws.
I had one in that thicket.
Ready to shake hands, until you came!
I'm sorry, then.
You look it!
Hungry too?
Come on.
You know how to skin griz?
I can skin most anything.
You sure are cocky for a starving pilgrim.
There she be. Go in, get warm, eat something.
I've got a chore to finish.
My boy!
Are you sure that you can skin griz?
Just as fast as you can find them.
Jesus!
Skin that one, pilgrim, and I'll get you another!
Must have missed another war down there.
Didn't miss nothing.
If I head due west tomorrow, will I find places to trap?
If you head due west or any place tomorrow, you'll be starving in a week.
You ain't likely to meet someone like me.
Mountain's got its own ways.
What?
Use that skin pad, pilgrim, before you lose all your fingers.
What you learned down in the flat will serve you no good up here.
You got some work to do.
Utes and Flatheads... are generally peaceful critters.
Crows, they are fearful.
Mighty warriors too.
In my opinion, the Crows are the handsomest Indians there is.
And proud too.
There ain't a man alive can match them on a horse.
I've seen them ride with one foot on the horse's rump... one wrist through a loop in the mane... shooting arrows and guns under the horse's neck!
But they are an adulterous people.
Adulterous.
Here you are, pilgrim.
Sharp enough to scale a fish with.
Ever get lonesome?
For what?
Woman?
Full-time night woman?
I never could find no tracks in a woman's heart.
I packed a Squaw for 10 years, pilgrim.
Cheyenne, she was.
And the meanest bitch that ever balled for beads!
I lodgepoled her at Dead Wolf Creek and traded her for a Hawkin gun!
Don't get me wrong,
I love the women, I surely do!
But I swear... a woman's breast is the hardest rock... the Almighty ever made on Earth... and I can find no sign on it.
Now these coals here will simmer until sunrise.
You better go do likewise.
Didn't put enough dirt down.
Saw it right off.
You track well, pilgrim.
- Kind of like it, don't you?
- Maybe.
Figures. A human man... likes tracking and killing.
An Injun, he figures it's natural.
Wind's right.
But he'll just run, soon as we step out of these trees.
Trick to it.
Walk out on this side of your horse.
What if he sees our feet?
Elk don't know how many feet a horse has.
No, you damn fool!
Slide it up over the saddle!
You got him, pilgrim!
You nailed him clean.
We got us an elk to skin!
Can't figure people there eating hog when they could feed on elk.
Didn't like it down there?
- Ought to have been different.
- Is that so?
Many a child journeys this high to be different.
To get from here what their natures couldn't get them below.
It comes to nothing.
Can't cheat the mountain, pilgrim.
Mountain got it...
Probably Crow. They'll steal our horses unless we bribe them.
Why?
It's their territory.
They figure we're trespassing.
Yep, Crow.
Paints-His-Shirt-Red.
That's his sign. Just stand still.
You two know each other?
I saw him once.
He says you fish poorly.
You understand their language?
Paints-His-Shirt speaks English, he just does this to aggravate me.
Says he's got enough bear claws.
Hold that.
What's your name?
Johnson.
Your Christian name?
Jeremiah.
You've learned well, pilgrim.
You'll go far.
Providing you ain't burnt alive or scalped.
I will do my best.
You can out wood and leave it up on the Judith.
Riverboat captains will leave you gold if you put out a pouch.
Good thing to know... if times get hard.
Watch your topknot.
Yes. Watch yours.
I told you not to go play outside.
You got yourself all dirty... and also, young lady... without your shoes.
And you, Josh... dirty!
Look at you! There, now!
Mary Lou, you knew better than to go out in the sun...
Have I told you not to go out... without a bonnet on your head?
You better stop there.
Woman, I am your friend.
We have graves to dig.
You were borne on the wind today.
Josh was being a bad boy.
I must tell your father.
Time to start the garden.
If the wind would stop.
We will now sing.
Shall we gather at the river
Where bright angel feet have trod
With its crystal tide forever
Flowing by the throne of God
Yes, we'll gather at the river
The beautiful, the beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God
Boy, did you see all this?
Better get one of these biscuits, boy.
I make damn good biscuits.
Here's food.
I could not find your husband anywhere, ma'am.
So, maybe he will come back here.
The Indians will not bother you now, on account of... you are touched.
They will be afraid.
What about the boy?
Maybe you and the boy best come with me now.
I will take you down to the Judith.
Put you on a ferry.
Take him.
- What?
- Take him!
Ma'am, I wouldn't know how to tend after...
You got a name, boy?
Huh?
I will call you Caleb.
It is a name
I have always admired.
You like that? Caleb?
Do what you like.
I was much the same myself.
Damn!
Are you all right?
Sure, I got a fine horse under me!
Got one of them feathers in my nose.
Keep sneezing, it'll come out all right.
Haven't seen anyone pass by recently, have you?
Nobody's gone in front of me.
Can't say what's happened behind me though.
The Injuns put you here?
It weren't Mormons.
A chief, name of Mad Wolf.
Nice fellow, don't talk a hell of a lot.
You wouldn't have an extra hat on you, would you?
Shade's getting scarce in these parts.
Why did you shave your head?
Mad Wolf figures like every other Injun I know.
Says this scalp ain't fit for no decent man's lodgepole.
Ain't the first time I protected my head in such a way.
Name's Del Gue.
With an "E."
- When did they come through?
- A few hours ago.
I will be happy to see my horse.
I hate walking.
I knew you would help me get my pelts back.
I wouldn't leave a man without a horse or gun.
Ain't that Hatchet Jack's rifle?
Yeah.
How did you get it?
I found him, froze to a tree.
Damn!
That Hatchet Jack was a wild one.
He was living with a female panther.
Two years in a cave up in the Musselshell.
She never did get used to him.
That be them.
- How many you figure?
- Three.
Just like before.
Are you smelling them Blackfeet?
No, I'm locating my horse.
Dirtiest animal this side of hell.
Come dark, you give me your pistol.
Load that bear rifle full of nails.
No. I got no truck with them Blackfeet.
I plan to be here a long time.
I do not want them down on me.
Them critters hammered me into the ground. Took my rifle, horse.
Stole my pelts. Not to mention what they done to that boy's folks!
Then let it pass?
Nope.
But they'll be asleep soon.
Should be no trouble to slip in there and then get your possibles.
Use this blanket, boy.
To keep you warm.
He don't say a lot, does he?
No.
Hey.
No.
No.
Stay here with the animals.
No!
I am Del Gue!
I can whip my weight in Wolverines... straight through a crab apple orchard on a flash of lightning!
You've stolen my pelts!
And die, you must!
You skinheaded son of a bitch, you almost got me killed!
Where are you going?
Don't you want any of these?
What?
Scalps!
No.
Mother Gue never raised such a foolish child.
Stop that, boy.
- What do you do with the scalps?
- Sell them to the English.
English?
London is wallpapered with Injun scalps.
- Let's pull into those trees.
- Don't go getting hasty.
Them is Flatheads, and they've hurt nobody that I know.
Just hold back.
- What's he saying?
- Says they're Blackfeet ponies.
He asks if you are the great warrior... who avenges the Crazy Woman in the Wolf Tail Valley.
She's big medicine.
And so are you, if you are that man.
- So what's he shouting for?
- Scared of you.
- But how did you...?
- I didn't know they'd be Flatheads.
It's all right, boy.
Chief here is named
Two-Tongues Lebeaux.
Mighty educated too.
French missionaries taught him their language.
- Christian Indians?
- Lots of them.
He says the scalps are fierce and the horses are fleet.
Take them.
Take them. And the ponies.
I have no further use for them.
Damn fool, you may have cooked our brains!
Why?
He brought us here to honor you and you want to give him a gift.
If he cannot give you a better one, it'll be an insult.
What's so funny?
The danger is over.
He has thought of a better gift.
- His daughter.
- Huh?
Now you have a son, you need a wife.
- I don't want no wife...
- He says he'll be very happy.
What is that word? Oh, yes!
He may read the Bible, but he's still an Injun.
And his rules is his rules.
If you value your hair, you will get married!
Del Gue,
I do not think this is funny.
It ain't.
When you leave, you can take her to Fort Hawley and sell her.
But you best take her, friend.
Besides, maybe she ain't near bad.
He says she's called The Swan, but she'll answer to anything you want.
But maybe you need her.
You turn down this gift, they'll slit you, me, Caleb and the horses... from crotch to eyeball with a dull deer antler!
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
Mrs. Johnson.
Your husband has told me so much about you.
Congratulations, Two-Tongues.
Wonderful wedding.
- Bye, Jeremiah Johnson!
- Where are you going?
I wouldn't want to disturb your wedding night.
I'll see you in the fall.
Have a nice honeymoon,
Mrs. Johnson.
Do you speak any English?
I don't speak any Flathead.
So don't bother me, neither of you!
Wondering about something?
Go ahead, ask.
Leave it be.
Nothing wrong with quiet.
Cooking sure don't smell like Bear Claw's.
Tie him off, boy.
Suppertime!
Go on, boy, and eat.
It's good for you.
No.
I'm full.
You religious too?
Religious.
I'm not going to harm you.
Religious.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm not going to harm you.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
Yes.
Ain't that a lot easier than saying all that gibberish?
Yes!
Great hunter.
Yes.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Fine figure of a man, yes?
Yes?
- Yes.
- That is all you need to know. For now.
You getting enough, boy?
Yes.
This wasn't my idea, you know?
Lord!
ThiS'll do.
River in front, cliffs behind.
Good water. Not much wind.
This will be a good place to live.
Hawk.
Yeah. Going for the Musselshell.
It'd take me a week's riding.
And he'll be there in...
Hell, he's there already.
I wish you would see fit to stop the practicing of these ceremonies.
NO!
Caleb, take notice of the traps and go fetch some proper food.
And keep your nose open, there may be Indians about.
Be going for buffalo soon.
No, you'll stay here.
Here. Go on, fetch the rest of that wood.
Ch.
Swan, I cannot stand this weight.
Well...
It will have to do.
Johnson.
It will keep me warm in the strong wind.
And the rain will not pass through neither.
Thank you.
You have beaver scent?
What happened to your face?
Huh? My beard?
Watch this.
Spring.
There.
Careful, that'll take your hand off.
Put that smell down.
Won't come around without the smell.
Hell, don't run off. It's me.
What?
Skin this.
Troop, halt!
Johnson?
I'm Lieutenant Mulvey,
Third Cavalry.
That's Reverend Lindquist.
We've been watched since we started to climb up from the Gila.
Who are they, Flathead?
I said, are they Flathead?
- Did I say something?
- No.
It's been a long time... since I had... so much of the English language spoke at me.
I ain't used to it.
Crow.
This is Crow land.
This is the Department of Colorado.
- Yeah.
- You're on good terms with them.
Crow?
Who gave you that idea?
People talk about it down below.
You live up here.
I do that.
And you know the high country.
Do you know Feather Mesa?
I do. So?
We have wagons there. Three of them.
Broke down in the snow and ice.
We got to get them out of there before they freeze.
Gr the Indians get them.
Would be wise.
We were told that you would know how to get there.
Through those passes.
We were hoping that maybe...
These are Christian families.
Christian women and children, starving.
Do you mean that you intend to let those people die?
How's the war going?
Which war?
One against the President of Mexico.
It's over.
Who won?
Did you hear something?
Can't go through here.
Why not?
Crow burial ground. Sacred.
- We'll have to turn around and head east.
- How far east?
Next pass.
Twenty... 20 miles or so.
Those people are waiting for us!
They're freezing, hungry and scared.
Crow only come with medicine men and burying parties!
- We are not Crows!
- What would happen?
I don't know.
I don't know.
This is big medicine.
They guard it with spirits.
You don't believe that.
It doesn't matter. They do.
You've been up here too long, believing in this!
What chance would I have finding a way through, just by riding west?
Poor chance. Or none.
Thanks all the same, Johnson, but we're riding through.
Sergeant! Prepare to move!
You won't make it.
You have to hunt, you said.
I have to try.
Tell your men to keep behind me in single file.
Tell them to go slow and stay quiet.
- Sergeant!
- Sir.
Single file, slowly.
Yes, sir.
Keep them quiet.
Well, we seem to have escaped.
How long have you been carrying your Squaw?
- Thank you...
- Move them fast.
Crow don't take kindly to trespassing.
Where's your mule that kicks holes in the sky and shakes off its saddle?
Where's your slavering wolf of the rolling prairie?
Here's your old grizzer brown bear can clobber bark off a gum tree.
There's a man for you,
Jeremiah Johnson.
I'm half horse, half gator, and a touch of the earthquake.
I got the prettiest gal, fastest horse... ugliest dog this side of hell.
I can outjump, outrun, throw down... drag out and whip any man in all Kentucky.
How you been, Jeremiah?
Staying alive, Del.
Ain't that hair I see on your head?
It sure is.
I've decided that when I depart from this life, I'd leave something.
At least to be remembered on some man's lodgepole.
Sound wisdom.
- Where you headed?
- Same place you are, Jeremiah.
Hell in the end.
With all them Injuns after you,
I cannot brag about your campsite.
You got old and scary since you growed hair on your head?
What ever happened to that boy?
The one that didn't talk much?
Never did take him to Hawley.
Stayed with that Injun gal all this time?
She wasn't no trouble.
Just like this, one at a time?
You're lucky they were Crows.
Apaches would send 50 at once.
Amongst Injuns... a tribe's greatness is figured on how mighty its enemies be.
Maybe...
Maybe you'd best go down to a town... get out of these mountains.
I've been to a town, Del.
Which way now?
Don't know.
I hear the Big Belt in the Blue has beavers the size of bobcats.
That so?
I ain't never trapped either... but sure would like to.
- Jeremiah-
- You will do well, Del.
You will do well.
If you don't get in too much trouble with all that hair.
Ain't this something?
I told my pap and mam
I was coming to the mountains... to trap and be a mountain man.
Acted like they was gut-shot.
Says: "Son..." make your life go here.
Here's where the people is.
"Them mountains is for animals and savages!"
I said: "Mother Gue..." the Rocky Mountains is the marrow of the world."
And by God, I was right.
Yes, you were.
Which way you headed, Jeremiah?
Canada, maybe.
I hear there's land there a man has never seen.
Keep your nose in the wind... your eyes along the skyline.
I will do that, Del Gue.
I ain't never seen them, but my common sense tells me... the Andes is foothills, and the Alps is for children to climb.
Keep good care of your hair!
These here are
God's finest sculpturings... and there ain't no laws for the brave ones!
And there ain't no asylums for the crazy ones!
And there ain't no churches except this right here.
And there ain't no priests... excepting the birds!
I are a mountain man! And I'll live until an arrow or bullet finds me.
And then I'll leave my bones... on this great map of the magnificent...
Right here, mister.
Where's the crazy woman?
She's gone.
Walk over this way.
Gone where?
Dead.
One of them mounds.
Who are you?
My name's Qualen.
I'm a settler.
Settler.
What are you going to do?
I do it when Indians are coming.
You're him.
Ain't you him?
What's this?
It's for you.
If you be Johnson.
A might early, ain't they?
It ain't a grave like the other.
More like a statue or a monument.
We never see them.
We never even hear them.
We look and there's e new piece of bone or hide, or somethings been left.
So we know they've been here.
Some say you're dead on account of this.
Others say you never will be on account of this.
It won't save anything.
Huh?
Sending them out to hide in the corncrib.
What's on the spit?
Grown particular?
Not about feeding.
Just the company I keep.
Thank you kindly.
You've come far, pilgrim.
Feels like far.
Was it worth the trouble?
What trouble?
You cook good rabbit, pilgrim.
Cold up here.
- What brings you up so high?
- Griz.
Griz.
Avalanche took the cabin.
Lost my mule.
We swum out of it.
But no matter.
Weren't no griz left anyway.
Would you happen to know what month of the year it is?
No, I truly wouldn't.
I'm sorry, pilgrim.
March.
Maybe April.
March, maybe.
I don't believe April.
Winter's a long time going?
Yeah.
Stays long this high.
March is a green, muddy month down below.
Some folks like it.
Farmers mostly.
You have done well to keep so much hair... when so many are after it.
I hope you will fare well.
Mind your step, Jenny.
Don't you worry none about me.
I can hold me gin.
I'm right as rain.
Ta-ta, love.
Mind how you go.
- Evening.
- Good evening.
- Iùs a raw night, isn't it?
- Yes. Raw.
- You'll ruin them fine clothes.
- Would you like this?
Come straight to the point, don't you, love?
Well, my place is right along here.
No.
There.
We are in a hurry, aren't we?
Come on, then.
Come along.
Oh, right you are, sir.
Wouldn't want to break it.
Wow. Thaùs lovely.
We got our own band.
Come on, then.
I'm hot and getting colder, if you take my meaning.
- Whaùs your name, dearie?
- John.
John.
John.
Oh, John.
Oh, John.
John.
John.
But my friends all call me Jack.
Will The Gazette continue with your pieces on free love, H. G?
Free love sells newspapers.
Gentleman, the Fleet Street Casanova.
Here, here.
I've got my little experiments to pay for.
You're the hero of the working class.
Free love is all they can afford.
Oh, Lord.
Don't start him on socialism.
We'll have to listen to a sermon on it.
Don't call it a sermon. You know
I don't believe in organized religion.
Socialism is the path man must tread on the way to a utopian society.
We've heard all that. Whaùs this great announcement we're here for?
- A cure for gravity?
- I want to wait until we're all here.
Who's missing?
- Dr. Stevenson is here.
- Thank you. Send him in.
- Good evening, John.
- Herbert.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
We'd begun to despair. Have you dined?
There's still roast beef.
Thank you, no. Perhaps a little brandy to take away the chill.
I'm sorry I missed supper, but a physician's hours are not his own.
- Gentlemen.
- Good health.
Cheers.
What has Herbert left for me tonight?
Chess must wait.
You're just in time for the surprise.
Isn't he, H. G?
The great big whatever-it-is?
- Am I?
- I was waiting for you.
- I am all attention.
- Very well.
Gentlemen, I have called you here tonight to bid you farewell.
- Farewell?
- Where are you going?
- Another holiday in Scotland?
- No. No, I am traveling...
...but I'm not leaving London.
I don't expect to leave my laboratory.
- Riddles again.
- Gentlemen.
I am talking about traveling through time.
In a machine constructed for that very purpose.
What?
- Poppycock.
- Why?
Electric light, courtesy of Edison, a modern Prometheus.
Good heavens. You were really serious.
I don't believe it. You've actually built the bloody thing.
- Free love paid for most of it.
- I've no doubt.
I didn't think practical jokes was in your line.
Twelve years ago, an engineer used the sun to power a printing press.
My time machine uses the same power source.
- You can't be serious.
- This thing is propelled by sunshine?
This cup catches the rays of the sun...
...converting its heat to electricity here.
Electricity does the rest. Juxtaposing fields of energy creating friction.
The result is an ever-increasing series of reactions...
...that literally rotates the machine out of one time sphere into another.
Cruising speed is two years per minute. Go into the past or future.
Two years per minute?
Acceleration keeps the machine and occupant outside all time spheres...
...conscious, but vaporized.
- How do you determine direction?
West, you gain yesterdays.
East, you accumulate tomorrows.
Balderdash!
Go north, you get to Glasgow.
The machine is designed with several safety features.
The reversal rotation lock returns the machine to its starting date...
...after the completion of a voyage.
If the occupant is injured during a flight...
...the passenger is returned to the point of departure.
Unless he uses this key to countermand the device.
Without that key, iùs a bloody homing pigeon.
And what, may I ask, is this?
Well, John...
...this is the vaporizing equalizer.
Without it, the passenger journeys without the machine...
...and without the machine, there is no coming back.
Well, H.G., which is it to be?
The past or the future?
The past, surely.
He'll want to meet Cleopatra.
- The future.
- Why the future?
I belong there. In three generations, social utopia will have come to pass.
There'll be no war, crime or poverty.
And no disease either, John.
Men will live like brothers, and in equality with women.
- Oh, dear. Leùs have the past.
- Here, here.
I can't agree with you. Check.
You astonish me. In the midst of all your theorizing, you ignore the facts.
We live in a cosmic charnel house.
Mankind has not changed in 2000 years.
We hunt, we're hunted. Thaùs how it is. How it will always be.
The future will prove you wrong.
The future will tell.
Anyway, I have just one question for myself. When do you leave?
- I'm not sure.
- Human frailty, at last.
Well, to be quite candid...
...I haven't worked up the nerve.
- First time for that.
But I will. All I have to do is set the date and activate the switches.
And I'll inherit the Hope diamond.
- Checkmate.
- How does he do it?
- Not again?
- Every time.
I know how he thinks. Thaùs all.
- One day I shall win.
- When you learn how I think.
Sorry to interrupt. Two gentlemen from
Scotland Yard want a word with you.
What is the meaning of this?
Beg pardon, sir.
Might we have a word with you?
- The Ripper? In this vicinity?
- I'm afraid so, sir.
We've cordoned off the neighborhood.
We're asking for cooperation.
Will that be all right? Your housekeeper will sleep better.
- By all means.
- Thank you, sir.
Whaùs happened?
Apparently, the Ripper has struck again.
- With your permission, sir.
- Please.
- He's not been heard from in years.
- Nor in this area.
No doubt about it, I'm afraid.
He has a very distinctive style.
- What have you there?
- You better look at this, sir.
- Thaùs Dr. Stevenson's bag.
- That belongs to one of my guests.
- Whaùs his name?
- John Leslie Stevenson.
- Chief surgeon at St. Bartholomew's...
- Also chief surgeon in Whitechapel.
- Nothing upstairs.
- All windows locked.
- Skylight?
- Closed.
- Checked the roof. No sign.
- In back?
A high brick wall.
He's not gone that way.
- He was with you just now?
- Yes.
He must have gone out the front, as we came in.
It doesn't matter. We know who he is, which is more than before tonight.
We'll round him up. If you come with me, I'll see that you get home safe.
- There's bound to be an explanation.
- Beyond belief.
Thank you, dear. Thaùs my umbrella.
I've never been so frightened. All the times I've put that bag in the closet.
- I wonder he didn't take it with him.
- We'd never have known.
- He was always such a gentleman.
- Yes. A gentleman.
I wonder where he got to so fast.
The coppers searched high and low.
We were by the door the whole time.
If he fooled them this long, no surprise he's done it again.
- What did you say?
- We were by the door the whole time.
When you learn how I think.
What have I done?
I've turned that bloody maniac loose upon utopia.
- Mr. Wells...
- Bring me all the housekeeping money.
And any money you have of your own.
I'll make it up to you.
- How much?
- Fifteen pounds, sixpence.
- You want it all?
- All, if you please, Mrs. Turner.
- Something wrong, sir?
- Would you mind awfully?
Money may not answer.
I may have to trade with the natives.
Let me see. The key.
86 years. Two years per minute.
That makes 43 minutes.
Estimated time of arrival would be...
Right.
Utopia.
Mr. Wells?
Mr. Wells?
Lindbergh's over the Irish coast... support of the woman I love... we have to fear is... their finest hour... attacked Pearl Harbor...
I shall return... this is London... whose throat you'd like to cut... proclaim the state of Israel...
Queen Elizabeth II is crowned... from North Korea...
Ask not...
President Kennedy is dead...
Martin Luther King... one small step for man... lsraeli athletes were killed...
Vietnam cease-fire agreement... because of Watergate... second test-tube baby...
Pope John Paul's successor... and executed four generals...
Mommy, look at that.
Mommy, come over here.
Mommy. Who's that man?
Jason, come away.
He probably works here.
The Wells exhibit is on loan from the British Muzeum.
The objects in this hall form a portrait of the public...
...and private life of an extraordinary person...
...whose prophetic vision influenced the shape of things to come.
On your left is the inlaid wood secretary with a unique top...
...from Wells' rooms.
It was on this desk...
Hey! Get away from the exhibit.
Where do you think you are,
Disneyland?
- Pardon?
- You heard me. Get behind those ropes.
- Was discovered by workmen digging where Wells' house once stood.
Come on.
The reasons for his building it are unknown.
- That it didn't work made him avoid discussing it.
- H.G. Wells was born in...
- Novel? Time Machine?
You people. Christ, Almighty.
Never.
Eight hours off.
What did you do to my car?
Can't you drive?
Some SOB can't read.
- Could you tell me what city this is?
- Oh, come on.
Could you please tell me what city this?
San Francisco?
California. Of course!
Eight hours difference.
Thirteen, 14, 15 pounds. This money is quite old, you're aware of that.
- They're still good, aren't they?
- Sure.
A coin dealer would give you more.
Here, all you'll get is the current exchange rate, which is...
- Twenty-five dollars?
- Really, iùs the same all over.
Money makes the world go round.
Iùs just worth less and less.
Money, yes.
Everyone needs money.
Has there been another gentlemen here recently...
...another Englishman with currency like mine?
Not that I recall.
And they would have sent him to me.
I see.
Get me a Big Mac, an order of fries and a small Coke to go, please.
Thank you, dear.
Get me a Big Mac, fries and tea to go, please.
Pommes frites.
Fries are pommes frites.
I never saw wood like this before.
I haven't seen stones in settings like these since before the war.
- The war?
- Since the Second World War. You know.
- Did you say, "world war"?
- Since World War II, I said.
- How much are they worth?
- Today's market? $6000 easy.
- Would you like to buy them?
- I couldn't give you top dollar.
Thaùs all right. Whaùs your offer?
- Four?
- Yes. Very well.
You don't want to think about it?
Okay. May I see some ID?
You know. Driver's license, credit card, something like that.
- I'm afraid I don't have some.
- I can't do business without some ID.
- How do I know these aren't hot?
- Hot?
- Stolen.
- Stolen?
I assure you, I give you my word as a gentleman.
Come on, whaùs this gentleman stuff?
How come you don't got any ID?
Let me do a computer check. If iùs clear, you'll have a check in a week.
I don't have a week.
I don't believe you exist.
But if you do, I need your help.
Just let me stay the night...
...and I'll be on my way in the morning. I won't trouble you again.
I'm sorry. We're closing now.
Utopia.
There you are, sir.
May I help you?
I'd like to see the foreign currency officer.
- You're looking at him.
- You?
Surely there must be a gentleman?
Don't be a chauvinist. Iùs taken me three years to get here.
Don't you believe in women's liberation?
Women's liberation.
I'm sorry. I meant no disrespect.
In fact, I was all for it, so I shouldn't complain.
You were all for it?
What changed your mind?
Nothing.
I don't know whether you can help me.
- May I help you?
- Thank you.
I'm certainly willing for you to try.
I'm looking for an Englishman who may have tried to exchange money.
I'll say.
Then he was here?
Yesterday, big as life.
With a money belt that was bigger.
Musùve weighed a ton. A friend?
We were traveling together, and now I've lost him.
- His name was John Leslie Stevenson.
- Thaùs him.
I wanted him to open an account but he only cashed a few hundred dollars.
You wouldn't happen to know whaùs become of him?
He asked me to recommend a hotel.
- An hotel?
- I sent him to the Hyatt Regency.
- Hyatt Regency?
- Yeah.
Oh, thank you.
You here on a visit?
Tourist type thing?
If you don't know anyone, let me show you around.
We San Franciscans are pretty proud of this old town.
Well...
...yes, perhaps that might be nice.
Iùs your option. You've got the card.
Give me a ring. My name's Amy.
- A ring?
- You know:
My number's on the card.
- Whaùs your name?
- Herbert...
...Wells.
What was that?
That was a very cute man.
That was a pickup.
- Against bank rules.
- I don't care.
At least he's not gay.
Plus, I love the way he talks.
How about that suit? Early American.
He'll be back.
- Whaùs up, doc?
- Pardon?
Where to?
Could you take me, as quickly as possible, to the Hyatt...?
- Who is it?
- Your breakfast, sir.
- Bless my soul.
- May I come in?
Certainly, certainly.
You were literally the last person on earth I expected to see.
There was no way to prevent the machine's return. I lack the key.
- No.
- You do manage to find the nerve...
...after I tested your machine for you.
How did you manage to track me down?
That was brilliant.
We'll add detective to your list of accomplishments.
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.
I'm not here to engage in idle banter, Stevenson.
You've used me and my machine to escape justice.
I must congratulate you on the device.
At dinner the other century,
I thought you'd lost your wits.
Fate intervened, and I ascertained that you are a Columbus of a new age.
The dawn of time travel.
I salute you.
- Come with me.
- Of course. Where are we going?
To the muzeum.
I'm obliged to take you back to face the consequences of your acts.
You can't be serious.
You're so Victorian.
How do I get back? By force?
Be reasonable, John.
We don't belong here.
- We violated...
- We don't belong here?
Let me show you something.
Sit down.
Come on, I won't bite. Sit.
Now, look...
Terrorists carried out their threat and began shooting...
...the first five of 106 Israeli schoolchildren held hostage...
You haven't gone forward, Herbert.
You've gone back.
We've just received word that
Mayor Margolin of Columbus was shot.
We don't belong here.
On the contrary...
...I belong here completely and utterly.
I'm home.
Iùs you who do not belong here.
You, with your absurd notions of a perfect and harmonious society. Drivel.
The world has caught up and surpassed me.
Ninety years ago, I was a freak.
Today, I'm an amateur.
You go back. The future isn't what you thought. Iùs what I am.
Do you know that you can purchase a rifle? Iùs legal.
- These people encourage...
- Stop it!
Iùs catching, isn't it?
Violence.
You finding me is rather fortuitous.
For me, that is.
Otherwise, I'd be obliged to search for you.
Are you going to give it to me?
- I have no idea what you mean.
- Of course you do.
I'm talking about the key.
I can't have you following me for eternity, like the Flying Dutchman.
Give me the key and we'll be quits.
IKey? I don't have it with me.
I've played countless games of chess with you...
...and the one thing you cannot do is bluff.
I want that key.
Oh, God.
Maid.
SeÚor.
Stevenson.
Is he okay?
I beg your pardon.
Just a moment, please.
Yes?
I'm looking for a patient recently admitted.
- Name?
- John Leslie Stevenson.
- Not here.
- They told me he'd be here.
- This is San Francisco Hospital?
- Not here under that name. Next.
- He just arrived. A motorcar hit him.
- A motorcar?
- Pardon?
- A car.
Yes, a car.
He's a tall, flaxen-haired, distinguished-looking Englishman.
Just a minute, please.
Sorry. An accident victim matching your description died 20 minutes ago.
- We had him listed as John Doe.
- Died?
Lmpossible. I saw him sitting up after the accident.
His chart says, "internal injuries."
It happens that way sometimes.
Wait. May I see the body?
Are you family? Are you a relative?
- He doesn't have any relatives.
- I'm sorry.
- Wait a minute, please.
- Excuse me.
O- R-A-J.
Gloriosky.
- Oh.
- Hello.
You'll let me take you to lunch.
Hello. What did you say?
I said, lunch on me.
What do you say?
Oh, well...
Just let me get my things.
That is what you had in mind?
- Certainly, if you like.
- Wait right there.
All set. Where to?
Well, iùs your city.
I'll leave it up to you.
I know, something with a view.
Don't worry, iùs safe. We haven't had any trouble since the big one in 1906.
Big one?
The earthquake. Don't you know?
You haven't done your reading.
- It leveled the whole shebang.
- The shebang?
I see.
Delicious. Far superior to that
Scottish place where I breakfasted.
- Scottish?
- MacDougall's.
- What about your friend?
- Friend?
Dr. Stevenson.
He wasn't exactly my friend.
We had a falling out.
I won't be seeing him again.
I like that suit. Is that what they're wearing in London?
It was when I left.
Are you from London? Everyone
I meet from England is from London.
Sorry, what were you saying?
I was asking if you're from London.
I have some friends there.
I thought you might know them.
I realize iùs a big city.
Anyway, their name is Phillips.
He works for Coca-Cola. Any chance?
- No, I'm afraid not.
- Ah, yes.
You probably move in different circles.
Are you a scientist or something?
Whatever makes you say that?
Just a hunch.
You give me the impression of someone who's cloistered away...
...in a library, doing research and never reads the newspaper.
I used to write for a newspaper.
The Pall Mall Gazette.
Really? Shows how much I know.
You're a reporter?
I wrote articles on whatever struck my fancy. Social issues, mainly.
The last thing I did was a series on free love.
Free love?
I haven't heard that term since the eighth grade.
Tell me something.
Did you think it was forward of me to invite you to lunch like this?
- Do you often...?
- Invite strange men to lunch? No.
But iùs not often that a strange man turns me on.
Or a strange woman.
I didn't mean to imply I was a dyke.
- A dyke?
- Sorry, lesbian.
I like my sex straight.
Iùs just that I go for months without meeting anybody who does it for me.
A lot of people, like my friend Carol...
I won't gossip, but a lot of people can sleep around.
Not me. I really have to like the guy.
Otherwise, iùs just no go.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't say that right off the bat.
Iùs not Women's Lib.
I just get nervous.
When I get nervous,
I tend to babble.
- Do I make you nervous?
- Yes.
- You do, sort of.
- Why?
Because I like you.
You ought to see the Golden Gate.
Whaùs that?
You're kidding.
How'd you decide to come here?
Stick a pin in a map or something?
- The Golden Gate.
- The Golden Gate.
- Want to drive across it?
- Oh, is it for motorcars?
R stands for "reverse," and D stands for "drive."
The right pedal causes us to accelerate while the left retards our speed.
Of course. Honestly, Herbert, you act like you've never been in a car before.
Nonsense, I was in one this morning.
You've a very good driver.
Damn straight. My husband used to drive in stock car rallies.
He taught me good.
- What are you thinking about?
- A brave new world with such people.
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.
You mentioned your husband.
My ex. Yeah, I was married for a while, when I was very young.
We met during an antiwar demonstration.
- The Second World War.
- What? How old do you think I am?
Oh, I'm sorry. The Third World War?
The Vietnam War.
Vietnam.
Iùs just that he wanted me to give up work and have children.
The housewife routine.
Not for me.
He never took my ambitions seriously.
What about you? You married?
I wouldn't be here if I were.
Well, thaùs nice.
A lot of guys...
Iùs no big deal.
I like that.
I'm also divorced, for similar reasons.
- She wanted you to be a housewife?
- She wanted me to be routine.
Well, that is one thing you definitely are not.
First I thought it was your voice or your clothes.
Now, I don't know.
Maybe iùs that "little boy lost" quality you give off.
- Brings out my maternal instincts.
- You're very perceptive.
Lost is what I am.
No.
Herbert.
Iùs only a movie.
I hate all that violence.
Did you ever see Red Shoes?
I really got off on that.
Careers.
Iùs 6:00.
Do you have plans for tonight?
I haven't made any.
- Are you tired of me yet?
- No, not in the least.
Great.
How about I cook you dinner?
I don't live very far from here.
- Iùs not too much trouble?
- I'm half Italian. I love to cook.
- What about the other half?
- Norwegian. Norwegians love to eat.
What on earth is that?
Isn't it incredible? They built it for the Pan-American Expo of 1914.
Somehow, iùs still standing.
I love living next to it.
Come on, I'll give you the cook's tour.
I bet you don't have anything like this in London.
- You've never seen the Albert Hall.
- I've never even been to London.
- Where do you live?
- This way.
You should see it when they turn the lights on.
- Is it marble?
- Would you believe plaster?
What on earth is Cosmopolitan?
Where are all your books?
I don't have all that many.
I don't seem to read much anymore.
Even when I have the time, iùs easier to watch TV...
...even though thaùs mainly crap.
Whaùs that?
The phone.
TeÔs idea.
Hello? Oh, hi.
Iùs my friend Carol, from the bank, checking up on you.
Yeah.
No.
Who knows?
Carol, I'm trying, so will you please let me get on with it?
I have to go now. Bye.
Carol says hi.
She asked if London is really crawling with Arabs.
- Arabs?
- She wants to marry into oil.
This is almost ready.
I'm going to change.
I've been in my work clothes all day.
Please, you go right ahead.
You look very beautiful.
Herbert, if you don't take me into your arms this minute...
...l'll scream.
Well, hello there.
Hello.
Why, Miss Jones, you're gorgeous.
- What?
- You don't close your eyes.
Well, neither do you.
These are the funniest buttons
I ever saw.
Iùs like it was some kind of costume.
Oh, my gosh.
Is the rest of this outfit as interesting?
Amy. Amy.
I don't want to compromise you.
Are you certain I'm not forcing you...?
Forcing me? My God, Herbert,
I'm practically raping you.
Yeah, thaùs true.
Here.
All naked, all right here.
The hottest, wildest, sexiest ladies in San Francisco.
Come on and check it out.
This is the one.
This is where iùs happening.
Come on in, buddy.
If you're old enough, you're bold enough.
Come here, come here.
Let me show you.
Third largest in the West.
The weather should be sunny.
Iùs a nippy 51 degrees, going up to 68...
...then dropping to an overnight low of 43.
Good morning.
Good morning.
- You want some coffee?
- Thank you.
- Walked into city hall and shot Mayor Margolin.
In local news, the second body in 14 hours was found in North Beach.
Identified as prostitute Cindy Chow...
...the mutilated corpse was found in an alley behind the City Lights Bookstore.
Police had no comment on the two murders...
...stating only that they were similar.
According to the police chief, there are no leads.
In other news...
No.
Coffee's ready.
How do you take it?
Is milk okay instead of cream?
I have to talk to you.
- I'm running late.
- Amy, I have to talk to you now.
He's alive and out there.
I have no idea what to do.
You say you're after this man.
Are you a detective?
You work for Scotland Yard?
Leùs just say their interests are definitely involved.
I don't understand. Why can't you just go to the police...
...tell them who they're looking for?
- Whaùs wrong with that?
- They'd never believe me.
- You don't know that
- They'd never...
If you knew the story, you'd never believe me.
- I'd believe you.
- Well, they wouldn't.
If I told the truth, they'd send me to a lunatic asylum, not him.
All right. I led you to him, didn't I?
What were you doing, visiting bank after bank?
Would you have slept with anyone who knew where he was?
You don't suppose that for one minute.
No. I guess I don't.
I don't know, this is very confusing.
I'm late on top of everything else.
- Today is the executive staff meeting.
- Sorry.
I didn't want to burden you.
I'll get dressed and go.
No, no, no.
Oh, please, you stay.
I don't know what to say.
I like you. I like you very much.
I'd like to see you again.
I don't know how to help you, if you can't go to the police.
- I don't know where you're staying.
- Yesterday was my first day.
Will you stay here for a while? Eat something and try to sort things out.
I'll call you if I get any bright ideas, okay?
Be sure and slam the door when you leave or it doesn't lock.
One thing I wouldn't have pegged you as, a detective.
Well, you look like the cat that ate the canary. Did you?
- Hi, Carol, how's everything?
- "Hi, Carol, how's everything?"
You're the one who took off the whole afternoon.
In one word, fabulous. He's...
I just can't describe it.
On second thought, please don't try.
I may just die of envy.
I want you to meet him. Could you come for dinner Friday, around 7?
I'm sure it will be fine with Herbert.
Herbert?
You must really be hooked.
I think so. I'll just check my busy social calendar. Talk to you later.
Hello again.
I've come to change some more currency.
Yes, of course.
How much did you want to exchange this time?
Oh, say 40 guineas.
Forty guineas.
I'm sorry, would you excuse me for a moment? I'll be right back.
Take your time.
Herbert, Herbert.
Come on, come on.
Herbert, iùs me.
- Listen, he's here.
- Amy?
- Who is?
- Who do you mean who? Who do you think?
What?
He's right at my desk with a money belt.
He wants to change more sovereigns.
- Herbert, what do I do? I'm terrified.
- Amy, be calm. Iùs all right.
You're in a bank.
He's mad but he's not stupid.
Now, nothing's going to happen to you.
- Can you keep him there?
- What?
Iùs a lot to ask, but try.
Just until I'm there. I'm on my way.
- I'll try.
- What did you say?
I said I'll try.
Sorry about that. I checked what the exchange rates are today.
They fluctuate every day.
I wouldn't want you to get gypped.
- Are you enjoying San Francisco?
- Very much.
Thaùs wonderful.
- Find room at the Hyatt Regency?
- Yes, thanks to you I've...
Thanks to you.
You wouldn't happen to know a man called Wells, would you?
I thought so.
Miss Amy Robbins.
He asked you to detain me until he got here, right?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Oh.
I won't conduct my business here anymore, if iùs all the same to you.
Good day.
There's just one other item.
Be good enough to leave a message for Wells from me.
Tell him I want that key.
Tell him to leave it for me at the exhibit. Leave it...
...or face the consequences.
Have you got that?
Yes, I believe you have.
Herbert! You gotta bring the police into this. Now if you don't, I will.
That man is crazy,
I could see it in his face.
And he threatened you.
Something about leaving the key to the exhibit.
Leùs tell the police. If you don't,
I will, but I don't know what to say.
You can't fool around with a person like that.
"Robbins. 2340 Francisco."
His name is John Leslie Stevenson.
English, he's a surgeon.
Approximately 37 years of age, flaxen-hair, clean-shaven...
...and stands well above
6 feet in height.
What makes you say that this,
Dr. Stevenson...
...is responsible for the death of the girls?
I just know for a fact he is.
- I see. Do you have spiritual powers?
- Do I what?
Are you a medium or a mystic?
I make no claim to supernatural gifts of any sort.
If I could reveal the source of my information, I...
As a matter of fact,
I'm also a detective.
I was sent from London on the trail of Stevenson, traveling incognito.
My name...
- My name is Sherlock Holmes
- Sherlock Holmes, I see.
Go on, go on.
I can't. I gave you a complete description, I told you his name.
I've told you everything I know.
It was good of you to share your insights, Mr. Holmes.
How can we reach you if we need to speak to you?
Is that necessary?
I'm staying with a friend.
Must we involve her?
Not unless iùs unavoidable we contact you. We're known for our discretion.
Very well.
Her name is Miss Amy Robbins.
She lives at 2340 Francisco.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Holmes.
You don't believe me, do you?
I'd like to. My job would be simpler if I could.
This printout says U.S. Customs has no record...
...of John Leslie Stevenson coming here. British Customs has no record...
...of a man by that name leaving.
There's no mention of a Mr. Holmes...
...coming into the country. Now he could be using another name...
...but since we don't know where he is, we can't question him.
- Can we?
- No.
Well, thank you for your time.
Good day.
Put this on file.
The entire affair was a fiasco.
- He didn't believe a word of it.
- Well, you tried.
Trying isn't enough, I'm afraid.
- Are we in or out here?
- Out.
- Would you care to join me for a walk?
- Sure.
You have to slam it. All right.
Old buildings have their little quirks.
Why is it your responsibility?
I'm going to tell you the truth.
In the first place, my name isn't Herbert Wells.
Iùs Herbert George Wells.
H.G. Wells.
In the second place,
I'm 113 years old.
I swear to God, I am telling you the truth.
Please, please believe me.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
You don't believe me?
Christ, Herbert, what do you think?
Please go away, I don't want to see you anymore.
Amy!
Please, Amy, listen to me!
I have listened to you. And a bigger crock of shit I never heard.
Look, I don't know if you're crazy, but I don't care.
Just go back to whatever hole you crawled out of.
Go back to your machine.
Amy...
Wait! Amy!
Amy, what if I can prove what I told you is true?
Won't you give me that chance?
I know I sound mad!
I knew how you'd respond. Didn't I say yesterday you wouldn't believe me?
And I said I would.
All right. There is an H.G. Wells exhibit with time machine.
There is some resemblance between you and the man in those pictures.
The muzeum is closing.
But that doesn't prove anything.
- Now what?
- I want you to go to the powder room.
Hang on.
- Hello.
- Hi! Holy shit! Flowers.
Wow. Let me go put these in water. Come on in.
- You're early.
- I couldn't wait.
You're cute. Last time I had flowers was my graduation in high school.
You bring flowers to all your women?
Why don't you sit down and I'll be right in, okay?
You want some grass?
Grass?
Marijuana. Don't they call it grass where you're from?
England, right? I could tell from your accent.
You're observant.
Are you a typical American woman?
Am I a typical American woman?
Me?
Yeah, more or less. You know.
I like to hang out.
And what about you?
- Are you a typical Englishman?
- Not really.
Neat watch.
Are we going somewhere?
No.
Well, what time is it?
Later than you think.
This is really dumb.
Whaùs this gizmo?
Well, leùs just say we wouldn't want to go anywhere without it.
Right. This time I'll drive.
Come on. Get in.
You know what you're doing? What am I saying? This is completely bananas.
I don't propose to take you a great distance. Suppose we go to Saturday.
- How would that be?
- Just fine. My cleaning's due back.
That would make it November the 10th.
Don't expect too much. The entire voyage will last a quarter of a second.
- You ready?
- Come on.
Good. Can we go now, please?
- You still maintain this is poppycock?
- That wasn't the word I had in mind.
Amy, you just wait. You wait.
We've got to go back.
We must go back.
We could easily avoid this whole thing.
- You mean give him the key.
- No.
I mean come back with me.
- Back?
- Yes. Back to 1893.
I'm a 20th century woman. I have a career and a mind of my own.
Be reasonable. How am I gonna make it in 1893?
Iùs your life we're talking about.
My work is my life.
As much as yours or any other man's.
Please don't start sounding like my husband.
- Wait a minute? What about forward?
- Forward?
You mean into the future. Yes!
Of course...
No.
No. We're forgetting something. Him!
I can't just leave him here.
So much for your place or mine.
Stop a bit.
You know we're making a big mistake.
We keep imagining time is our enemy.
Iùs not.
We know whaùs supposed to happen.
When and where. He doesn't.
This is one time I do know how he thinks.
I even know before he thinks.
Look here. We're too late to prevent the murder of number three.
But what about number four?
Leùs see.
Dolores Marks. She was killed in McLaren Park. Is that far?
Nothing's far in San Francisco.
She was killed. Or rather she will be killed...
...at 3:00 in the morning in McLaren Park.
All I have to do is surprise him.
I'll just sit tight here for a few hours and then be off.
We. I'm coming too.
No. I absolutely forbid it.
Herbert, you can't drive.
You don't even know where the park is.
I'm safe. I've got till Friday at 7:30. Haven't you read the paper?
Too bad there aren't any sport stores open.
Whatever for?
So we could buy a gun.
- He's dangerous, haven't you heard?
- I wouldn't purchase a weapon now.
What is this Victorian chivalry?
We're playing for keeps.
Exactly. And Stevenson was right about one thing.
Violence is contagious. Like measles.
The problem is not that things aren't more efficient. They're the same.
World war this. World war that.
We're obviously killing more efficiently. But we're still killing.
Well, I'm not going to stoop to that man's barbaric level.
The first man to raise a fist is the man who has run out of ideas.
I love you.
Oh, no.
Whaùs happening?
Goddamn it! The tire is flat.
- Can you mend it? Can it be repaired?
- Yes. Iùs gonna take time.
All right, Amy. Calm down.
You work as fast as you can and I'll go telephone the police.
Where would I be likely to find one?
I don't know. There are phone booths all around. Do you have a dime?
Herbert, do you have ten cents for the call? Hurry!
- Here. Iùs 911.
- Read the instructions.
- I'll be right back.
Out of order? Damn!
Did you get that? McLaren Park.
Get there as soon as possible.
Can I what? Wells. No, Holmes.
Sherlock Holmes.
McLaren Park, as soon as possible.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I think so.
Oh, no. No.
IKeep moving.
Don't stop, do you hear me?
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, Amy. Go! Come on!
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.
First the zodiac and now this.
- Yeah, they're out for blood, I see.
- I see Mr. Holmes called.
- What time would that be?
- That was at 2:45 a.m.
Maybe he is psychic.
No.
We won't be here.
Iùs simple, we just won't be here.
- Iùs 10:30. I'm going to go out.
- No!
Just for a little bit. I'll come back, and we'll be off well before 7:30.
Where are you going?
Iùs something I've got to do.
And you do trust me, don't you?
I tell you what. Whaùs the best hotel in the city, your favorite?
The Huntington. I used to work there.
The Huntington. Write down the telephone number.
If I'm not back in an hour, register at the hotel. You've got the car.
- Promise you'll be back. Promise me.
- I promise. I promise.
Now you try and get some rest.
There's brandy in the flask if you need it.
Thaùs all right, I have some Valium.
- Sedatives.
- All right. Try and get some rest.
Hold it right there.
- What is the meaning of this?
- Shut up.
Amy!
- Look here.
- Listen, constable...
- Amy! Amy, get out of the house!
- Come on!
- Just get Lieutenant Mitchell...
- Look ahead.
- You're gonna have another murder.
- State your name, please.
I told you. Herbert George Wells.
What is this?
- Your valuables.
- Preposterous. Now please hurry.
- There is a lady in grave danger.
- Your watch, please.
My watch? This is ridiculous.
Please, where is Lieutenant Mitchell?
- You don't need that.
- Yes, we do.
Miss Amy Robbins is in very great...
Why do you need my glasses?
- I demand to see Lieutenant Mitchell!
- Relax.
I'm sorry, we have no one by the name
Amy Robbins registered at the hotel.
You've absolutely no right...
- Let me see Lieutenant Mitchell.
- No.
Now! Soon! Hurry! Please! Help!
I've told you. I've told you 50 times.
My name is H.G. Wells.
I came here in a time machine.
I'm pursuing Jack the Ripper...
...who escaped into the future.
If you don't do something, he'll kill Miss Robbins by 7:30.
What about the gun? They weren't making that model back in 1893.
I purchased it to defend Miss Robbins should the worst come to the worst.
- Where did you purchase it?
- A pawn shop. I don't remember it.
You're wasting your time.
Please listen to me.
Forget about the shop and the time machine. Forget that I'm H.G. Wells.
Please just save the girl.
You'll have to do better than that.
Last time you were Sherlock Holmes.
- All right, leùs take it from the top.
- My name is H.G. Wells.
I came here in a time machine.
The one at the muzeum.
- Just tell me what you want.
- I want the truth!
We're gonna stay here until I get it.
Take a look at this.
Thaùs right. Thaùs it.
Take a look.
Look, you cretinous idiot.
This is tomorrow's bloody paper.
You see what will happen if you don't listen to me!
Mr. Wells, or whatever your real name is...
...you know that novelty shops will run a phony newspaper edition.
You may have been born yesterday, but
I wasn't. Where did you get the gun?
Herbert.
Herbert?
You want to break for dinner? Hey!
I'll strike a bargain.
I'll confess to anything you like!
I killed them all.
Now, please...
Please send a car to 2340 Francisco.
Send a car and I'll sign whatever you want.
You're free to go.
I'm sorry.
Please believe me. I'm truly sorry.
Herbert.
Herbert, I'm over here.
He murdered Carol, my friend. I forgot
I invited her over to meet you.
- Amy?
- He's got the car.
Amy?
- The newspaper was wrong.
- Amy.
Not so fast.
We have a little unfinished business.
- What more do you want?
- You know what I want. Give me the key.
And you get the white queen.
All right.
- Let her go and I'll throw it to you.
- No.
My mother was atrocious, but she didn't raise mentally deficient sons.
You throw me the key and I'll release the girl.
- On your honor.
- You have my word as a gentleman.
Now there's just one thing.
I woulÔve expected that you'd noticed
I am not a gentleman.
- Say goodbye.
- Goodbye, Herbert.
You know where we're going.
You haven't instructed him in the use of one of these machines?
Go faster. Please.
Go faster.
If I go any faster I'm gonna wrap us around a phone pole.
- Herbert!
- Stevenson!
Stevenson!
What is it, H. G? You're becoming extremely tiresome.
- The girl.
- Which girl? You mean this one?
Let her go. Please, I beg you.
You can afford to be magnanimous.
Women throughout the centuries are yours for the taking.
Is it so important?
I don't find her attractive. Do you?
You're not about to disagree?
No.
- No, what?
- No, I don't find her attractive.
- Shall I cut her throat then?
- No. Please.
John. You and I, we were friends once.
I admired you.
What are you babbling about, Wells?
You've become quite an old fool.
Yes. I am an old fool.
I know nothing.
And she means that much to you?
Yes.
Please.
I'm sorry.
H.G., iùs checkmate and you've lost again.
Herbert!
What did you do?
I sent him to where he belongs.
Infinity.
Thaùs the last anyone will hear of Jack the Ripper.
Iùs time for us to say goodbye before the police arrive.
You going back?
- Why?
- I've got to dismantle that machine.
Until we master ourselves we have no proper use for time.
I've got those books to write.
Whatever they are.
Fiction, I hope.
Every age is the same.
Iùs only love that makes any of them bearable.
And finally, I must go back because that is where I belong.
And my life is almost as important to me as yours.
Not quite.
Almost.
Herbert! You wait for me!
You wait for me!
Herbert!
It isn't life without you.
Please, look at me.
Don't expect miracles. I'm changing my name to Susan B. Anthony.
Leùs go.
After the conquest and plundering of the Inca empire by Spain...
...the Indians invented the legend of El Dorado...
...a land of gold, located in the swamps of the Amazon headwaters.
A large expedition of Spanish adventurers, led by Gonzalo Pizarro...
...set off from the Peruvian highlands in late 1560.
The only document to survive from this lost expedition...
...is the diary of the monk
Gaspar de Carvajal.
On Christmas day 1560, we reached the last pass of the Andes...
...and for the first time looked down at the legendary jungle.
In the morning I read mass, then we descended through the clouds.
AGUIRRE,
THE WRATH OF GOD
A film by
Werner Herzog
No one can get down that river alive!
I tell you, we can do it!
From here it will be easier.
No. We're all going to go under.
Our Indian slaves are useless.
The changing climate kills them off like flies...
...most of them die of colds.
We don't even have time to give them a Christian burial.
Come on, move it!
Move you pigs!
Come on! Let's go!
Keep moving, we don't want to get stuck in the mud!
Son of a bitch!
You idiots!
The sedan-chair will get stuck!
This way!
Damned mud!
Watch it, you idiots!
Keep the barrel out of the water!
By the last day of the year, we were exhausted.
We camped near the river.
It can't go on like this, men.
The rations are almost finished.
The terrain is so difficult, we're almost at a standstill.
We cannot hope to reach a populated area for some time.
In view of the situation we're in...
...I have changed my plans...
...as follows:
Rafts will be built and manned by forty men.
These men will have the task...
...to get food and information about hostile Indians...
...and the location of El Dorado.
We have every reason to believe that both are near...
The expedition must return within one week...
...by water or by land.
If it doesn't...
...we have to assume it is lost...
...and we have to march back the same way...
...in the hope of reaching an area inhabited by Christians.
We hope, of course, that this will not happen...
...as long as the Virgin Mary is with us.
After careful consideration,
I have decided...
...to make Don Pedro de Ursua commander of the expedition.
His mistress, Dona Inez de Atienza, will accompany him.
This happens against my better judgement.
But she expressed her wish with such grace and firmness...
...that I cannot refuse it.
Don Lope de Aguirre will be second in command.
A man who is well qualified for this task.
His daughter Flores will stay under his protection...
...this also is against my better judgement.
At fifteen, she should have stayed in the care of the Holy Sisters.
As on all expeditions, the word of
God must be brought to the pagans.
I hereby nominate Brother
Gaspar de Carvajal for this task.
The remaining two hundred slaves will stay with my group.
The Royal House of Spain will be represented...
...by the brave nobleman,
Don Fernando de Guzman...
...who proved his courage
10 years ago...
...at the storming of the fortress of Saxahuaman.
Some of the best warriors will form this group...
...but those not chosen shouldn't feel rejected.
I declare all this in the form of a document...
...to be submitted for approval to the Council of the Indies.
Herewith I append my signature.
Four days later, on January fourth, we set out.
May God be with us.
Watch the raft, the rapids get stronger!
Keep in the middle of the river!
- The first raft got stuck in an eddy!
- They must get away from the rocks!
January Sixth.
We finally reached shore and set up camp.
On the other side of the river, one of our rafts ran into an eddy.
We could not hear what they were yelling, and could not help.
How many are on the raft?
Seven and two Indians.
We must try to help the poor devils, Aguirre.
You are crazy!
We will not help them!
I'm still giving the orders.
Is that so...
We need long ropes and hooks.
Further downstream we can cross.
Once we're on the other side, we'll be able to get them out.
Take as many men as you need... and hurry!
I wonder if Armando has reached the other side?
Those men must be getting sick.
They're still going around in circles.
- What is this?
- They're firing over there.
They're trying to signal us.
Maybe it's a battle?
There are only six.
The oarsmen and the seventh man have gone.
I find that strange.
Look, the oars are still there.
I'm sure, there are still some Indians in this area.
We better go back to the camp.
Keep your eyes open!
Help!
Indians! Indians!
A prayer from here is not enough,
Brother Carvajal.
I want to take these men back for a Christian burial.
You are right, my son...
...their souls will rest much better in consecrated ground.
It's the least we can do for these poor guys who died so bravely.
Perucho!
Perucho, don't you think the cannon is getting a bit rusty?
Perhaps.
You know very well who is responsible.
If Aguirre gets away with this, who knows what he'll do next?
Don't worry about that.
We really have other problems.
There are Indians everywhere.
The whole area is full of them...
...and no one wants to die like the men on the raft.
If only we were out of this trouble...
We can't hope for that yet.
Don't be afraid.
Aguirre would never dare to rebel against the Spanish crown.
We are not in Castile, here.
Look what I've found for you.
This animal sleeps its whole life away.
It's never really awake.
Our rafts are gone.
The rafts are gone!
January Eighth.
The river rose fifteen feet over night.
When will our misfortunes end?
If I remove your chains, will you run away?
Would you?
Stop, wait a minute, isn't that my pot?
What are you doing with my pot?
No, the wood is too heavy.
We'll take this one. I'm not taking one step further into this jungle.
What's going on?
We're making nails.
What for?
We need as many nails as possible.
What are you doing with this log?
Well, I'm carrying it from where
I found it back to the camp.
Who gave that order?
Everyone here is collecting wood.
And iron.
What's going on here?
I have no idea.
Who gave the order to build rafts?
What does it all mean?
Do you know, Inez?
Don't even ask.
It's your father's fault.
If only it were all over.
Gentlemen, as your commander,
I have decided...
...to return to our main troop.
It's not my habit to retreat.
We have to march back, of course, because the current is too strong.
We need to get back within the time Pizarro ordered.
But that would be suicide because of the Indians.
Whatever the cost, we have to march back.
We must get back to Pizarro!
Shit on Pizarro!
I say, we can't accomplish our task this way.
And I say, we can conquer without Pizarro!
That's what we gathered logs and iron for...
...to build a raft.
Do you remember Hernando Cortez?
Bound for Mexico, he was ordered to return...
...but he just went on!
Silence, Aguirre!
He ignored the orders and conquered Mexico!
Silence, everyone!
That's how he became rich and famous...
Be quiet!
Because he disobeyed!
Put him in chains!
Stop it, now!
- I follow Ursua.
- Kill him!
Anyone else?
What do you think will happen now?
What if there are waterfalls downstream?
Who cares, as long as we get closer to El Dorado.
Have you seen Ursua clenching his fist?
He must have something in it.
I think, they will kill him.
Would you have the courage to help him?
You're the only one who can help us.
I know he will kill Ursua and Armando.
He will finish what he has started.
You are my last hope.
Thou lettest man flow on like a river...
...and Thy years know no end.
As for man...
...his days are like grass...
...as a flower on the field, so he blossoms.
For when the wind passeth over it...
...and it is gone, and the place thereof shall know it no more.
You know, my child...
...for the good of our Lord...
...the Church was always on the side of the strong.
I would like to have you on our side.
We need men like you.
You should think about it...
...but not too long.
Well, gentlemen...
...we've gotten rid of the troublemakers.
Now we need a leader.
For me, the choice is clear.
We should elect the biggest and strongest nobleman we have.
- What me?
- Yes... you.
Well, gentlemen.
I am making a proposal to elect Guzmán.
Who else is for him?
I propose that Don Lope de Aguirre remains second-in-command!
Who's in favor?
Plagues have come over my people, earthquakes and floods...
...but what the Spaniards did to us...
...is much, much worse.
They gave me the name Balthasar, but my real name is Runo Rimac.
- What does that mean?
- Runo Rimac.
It means: He who speaks.
I was a prince in this land.
No one was allowed to look directly into my eyes.
But now I'm in chains, like my people...
...and I must bow my head.
Almost everything was taken from us.
I can't do anything, I'm powerless.
But I am also sorry for you...
...because I know there is no escape from this jungle.
How is Ursua?
Because of our mutiny, we must make our position legal.
Read this document.
Caesarian King, by the grace of God, through our Holy Mother...
...the Roman Church,
Philip the Second of Castile.
We, the undersigned, have until yesterday...
...the seventh day of 1561
...regarded ourselves as your servants and subjects.
We are now more than 200 miles from your servant, Gonzalo Pizarro.
Fate, God's help and the work of our hands have carried us down a river.
A river, the natives call Huallaga, in search of a new land of gold.
We have decided to put an end to the quirks of fate.
We are forging history, and no fruits of this earth shall henceforth be shared.
We rebel until death.
Our hands shall perish and our tongues dry up if this is not so.
The House of Habsburg is overthrown.
And you, Philip the Second, are dethroned.
By dint of this declaration, be you annihilated.
In your place we proclaim...
...the nobleman from Sevilla,
Don Fernando de Guzmán...
...as Emperor of El Dorado.
Flee from hence, O King!
And may God bless your soul.
Fortune smiles on the brave and spits on the coward.
Let's sever our ties with Spain and crown Don Fernando de Guzmán...
...Emperor of El Dorado.
Do you call this a throne?
What is a throne, but a plank covered with velvet, Your Majesty.
He must have dragged himself along.
That's no arrow wound, that was a sword thrust.
He must have tried to stop him.
January Tenth.
Armando escaped from his prison.
The man who went on guard at three o'clock was murdered.
It was one of his men.
While Ursua is alive...
...you'll never be safe!
What can I do about it?
Kill him.
While I'm Emperor, law will prevail.
No killings without a trial.
Then try him... and then kill him!
But it must me a public trial.
He still has sympathizers.
Perucho, to the witness stand.
What did you get out of Ursua?
Nothing.
Three men couldn't open his fist.
He must have something in it.
We'd have to chop his hand off to get at it.
He said nothing, except some nonsense.
But last night he had visitors.
The whole story reeks of conspiracy.
Balthasar, ask him if it's true that he received money from Ursua.
Yes, it's true.
It was the oarsmen's pay.
Next witness!
Okello, is it true that you also received money from Ursua?
I was Pizarro's slave. Then he gave me away for this expedition...
...because he thought, if the Indians are scared of a horse...
...they'd be terrified of a black man.
Well, I don't know why, but sometimes Ursua gave me money.
What does the defendant have to say?
I want to speak.
In Spain I had many servants, and I paid them.
It is only fair to give them money here as well...
...even if they are Indians.
Time will tell that Ursua is right.
We understand your confusion, my child. You are excused.
The jury, after having heard all testimonies...
...finds the defendant...
...guilty of treason.
My unpleasant duty...
...as President of the first court of your Highness, Don Fernando...
...is to sentence Pedro de Ursua...
...to death by hanging.
I confirm the verdict.
But since it is the anniversary of the last Moor leaving Spain...
...I will grant clemency.
His life will be spared, but he forfeits...
...all rights as a citizen of El Dorado.
Half of his shares will go to the Church...
...the other half will be divided among my best soldiers.
January Twelfth.
In the morning we set out with a new raft.
Ursua is still alive...
...but he refuses to speak.
Look, a fire!
At noon we saw a great fire.
Steer closer to the shore!
Load your muskets.
I can't see anyone.
Be careful, men!
It could be an ambush.
Strip the negro, go on!
Fearing an ambush, we stripped the negro slave, to frighten the Indians.
Go! Run!
Go on! Go, I said!
Drive him in front of us!
Get away from the food!
Look out for Indians!
Are you crazy?
Take your weapons!
Look at that. It was one of our men.
Where does this come from?
And this here?
For heaven's sake, cannibals!
The discovery of cannibals around us was so disturbing...
...that we hastily left this dreadful place.
January twentieth.
The mountains are now behind us and the land is flat.
The roof Aguirre had us build, protects us against the scorching sun.
The river is sluggish and we're slowly coming to a halt.
What's this?
Are you giving him a gun?
Aguirre, I know that you plan on doing something to Ursua!
There's no doubt in my mind.
And God will punish you for that!
Get out of my way!
Are you alright, little one?
What's happening?
You can't hear a thing.
It's suddenly so quiet.
Yes, not a sound.
Shh... so, we can hear...
The gunpowder! It's on fire!
Out of the way! It's going to blow up!
Grab the pole!
Help me pull the Emperor onto the raft!
Here, so he can hold on to it.
Damned horse...
...nothing but trouble!
What's wrong with him?
He's dead.
Look how short the arrow is.
Poisoned.
It must belong to a dwarf.
- Fire! Make some noise, quickly!
- What are we to aim at?
Just shoot, you asshole!
Fire!
Fire!
Come, play something for the men.
- Look, isn't that a canoe?
- Where?
Over there under those trees, it's coming towards us.
Keep the raft mid-stream.
It could be a trap.
January twenty fourth.
For the first time, we saw two of the savages.
They seemed to be trusting.
Pull the boat close.
I have the man. Hold him!
And I have the woman.
Look, there's a fish!
What did he say?
He says...
...he's from the Yagua Tribe.
He knows from his ancestors that one day, the Sons of the Sun...
...would arrive from afar, through great perils.
The strangers would come with thunder from tubes.
They've waited a long time for the coming of the Sons of the Sun.
For here on this river,
God never finished His Creation.
Look, gold!
Where did you get that?
Gold!
Gold! Ask him where he got it from.
Ask him where El Dorado is.
Where does this gold come from?
What did he say?
Has this savage ever heard of our savior Jesus Christ...
...and of our mission and the True Word of God?
This is a Bible.
It contains the Word of God...
...that we preach to bring light into the darkness of their world.
Does he understand at all, that this book contains the Word of God?
Take it in your hand, my son.
- He says, it doesn't talk.
- Kill him for this blasphemy!
It is a tough business.
These savages are hard to convert.
It won't be much longer.
El Dorado might be only a few days away.
No more rust on the cannon.
We will shoot our enemies with golden bullets.
And you, Okello, will serve my food on golden platters.
And all of us will gain something.
Governships...
...provinces...
...and women.
And perhaps I'll even be free.
Let's not forget the most important part of our mission...
...to spread the Word of God to the savages.
I'm sure you'd like a golden cross studded with jewels, Carvajal...
...instead of the silver one you lost.
All the land to our left and all the land to our right...
...now belongs to us.
I solemnly and formally take possession of all this land.
Our country is already six times larger than Spain...
...and every day we drift, makes it bigger.
Have you seen any solid ground that would support your weight?
Okello, it's missing salt!
Fish and fruit we can find now and then...
...but we've been out of salt for a while.
We're down to counting our last grains of corn.
- Hold the horse!
- The horse has cut loose!
- Take the reins!
- Watch out!
Watch, that it doesn't jump off board!
Damn, get that horse away from me!
Get rid of it!
Throw that damned beast off the raft!
Go on!
Go for a swim!
- It wants to get back on board.
- Go away!
I think he's a dead man.
In Mexico, I saw an army of Indians flee at the sight of one single horse.
And besides, we could have eaten meat for a week...
Don't worry, little one, the horse will be alright.
Oh, my God, the Emperor!
The Emperor is dead!
After our Emperor's death, the fate of Ursua was sealed.
Next morning, a few soldiers took him away and he never came back.
Little mother,
...two by two...
...wafts the wind on my hair.
What are they shouting?
They're shouting,
"Meat is floating by."
Fire!
Set the village on fire!
Keep shooting, it'll scare them!
Don't go into the jungle!
Salt!
Salt!
I haven't had salt for a month!
She has gone without a trace.
We couldn't find her anywhere.
We have not seen any Indians either.
Let's march back to Pizarro.
Two men, more or less, it won't matter to him.
I am sick of it. I'm leaving tonight.
If I march at night, the Indians won't catch me.
In the day, I will hide.
I will get back to Pizarro.
We followed her tracks half a mile into the jungle, then we lost them.
She simply vanished!
Then one of the men panicked because of the silence...
...which always comes just before someone gets killed.
I'd rather join the Indians, than stay with this madman.
That man is a head taller than me.
That may change...
I'll explain my plan.
I have counted the river bends.
I've drawn a map in the sand.
We need about a day for each bend.
One, two...
...three, four, five...
...six, seven...
...eight...
...nine...
...ten.
I am the great traitor.
There can be no greater!
Whoever even thinks about deserting will be cut into 198 pieces!
And then trampled upon until you can paint the walls with him.
Whoever eats one grain too many...
...or drinks one drop of water too much...
...will be locked up for 155 years!
If I, Aguirre, want the birds to drop dead from the trees...
...the birds will drop dead from the trees.
I am the Wrath of God!
The earth I walk upon sees me and quakes!
But whoever follows me and the river, will win untold riches.
But whoever deserts...
Get away from the tree!
Go to mid-stream!
- Hey, give me a pole!
- Watch out, the roof!
Watch out, the sedan-chair is falling!
Careful!
Over there.
The long arrows are getting fashionable...
- Indians!
- Where? I don't see any.
- Make noise!
- I better get out of here.
February first.
The men's morale is at a low point.
I spoke with Aguirre.
Things are not turning out as we expected.
We see nothing but hunger and death.
We lose men, but we never see the enemy.
Even El Dorado hasn't been more than an illusion.
Mexico was no illusion!
If we turn back now, others will come.
And they will succeed!
And we'll remain a failure!
Even if this land only consists of trees and water...
...we will conquer it!
And it'll be milked dry by those who follow us.
My men measure riches in gold.
It is more.
It is power and fame.
I despise them for it.
I am sure, Aguirre is leading us into destruction.
I almost feel, he does it deliberately.
We can't even get ashore, since the river flooded the jungle for miles.
February twenty-second.
The suffering is dreadful.
Most men have fever and hallucinations.
Hardly anyone can stand upright.
The soldier Justo Gonzales drank my ink, thinking it was medicine.
I can no longer write.
We are drifting in circles.
I see a ship with sails...
...in a tall tree...
...and from the stern hangs a canoe.
The ship is in your imagination.
No floodwaters could rise this high.
We all have the fever.
It is only a mirage.
These things happen when people are overly exhausted.
Shut up, monk!
We'll get that ship! It is real!
We'll sail to the Atlantic with it.
No, Lope de Aguirre, I won't go with you. We are weak and hungry.
That is no ship. That is no forest.
That is no arrow.
We just imagine the arrows, because we fear them.
These arrows are real, take cover!
This arrow can't harm me.
This is not rain.
Monk, do not forget to pray, lest God's end...
...will be uncomely.
When we reach the sea...
...we will build a bigger ship...
...sail north and take Trinidad from the Spanish crown.
From there we'll sail on...
...and take Mexico from Cortez.
What great treachery this will be!
Then, all of New Spain will be in our hands...
...and we'll stage history...
...like others stage plays.
I, the Wrath of God...
...will marry my own daughter...
...and with her I will found the purest dynasty...
...the earth has ever seen.
Together...
...we shall rule this entire continent.
We will endure.
I am the Wrath of God!
Who else is with me?
I've come back.
Give me a drink, brother Kipling.
Don't you know me?
No.
I don't know you.
Who are you?
What can I do for you?
I told you, give me a drink.
It was all settled... right here in this office.
Remember?
Danny and me signed the contract... and you witnessed it.
You... stood over there.
I stood there.
And Daniel stood here.
Remember?
Carnehan.
Peachy Taliaferro Carnehan.
Of course.
Keep looking at me.
It helps to keep my soul from flying off.
Carnehan.
The same... and not the same who sat beside you in the first-class carriage... on the train to Marwar Junction... three summers and a thousand years ago.
Jodhpur, please.
Blast.
May I?
Riding in this bloody ash cart... is like getting kicked in the rear by a battery mule every ten minutes.
Mr. Clutterbury Das... failed entrance examination,
Calcutta University, 1863.
Writer of correspondence for the illiterate general public.
Shut up.
Thank you, sir.
Out the window, babu.
Thank you, sir.
Outside, you inky-fingered thief.
- And I hope you break your dirty neck.
- Thank you, sir.
Good God, man, you might have killed the chap.
Serves him right if I had.
But we're not making five miles an hour on this grade.
But why?
I caught him stealing your watch.
My watch?
I say, it is my watch.
Well.
I'm very much obliged to you, Mr...?
Carnehan. Former gunnery sergeant in Her Majesty's Forces.
Mine's Kipling.
- May I offer you a drink?
- I don't mind if I do.
You've knocked about India a bit,
I take it?
You can say that twice.
On foot, on horseback and on camel.
But you don't look too green yourself, either.
No, I was born in India.
Great country, or was till the bureaucrats took over and ruined everything.
- I hope you're not one of them.
- No, I'm not a bureaucrat.
No, I didn't think so.
They're usually narrow-chested chaps with long noses for looking down at you... and I've yet to have one of them offer me a drink.
Glenlivet, 12 years old.
You've an educated taste in whiskey.
I've an educated taste in whiskey and women... waistcoats and bills of fare... but I've had few chances to exercise it lately.
Because them that governs spend all their time making up new laws... to stop men like you and me from getting anywhere.
And who's loss is it?
Why England's, of course.
If such as we were given our heads, it wouldn't be 70 millions... she'd be making in revenues, it'd be 700 millions. Right?
Yes, I quite agree. Yes.
- Where are you heading for?
- Jodhpur.
Will you be travelling back along this line?
- In about ten days time.
- Could you make it eight?
I must get a message to a man who'll be travelling through Marwar Junction... on the Bombay Mail on the night of the 24th.
He expects me to meet him, but I can't.
- I've got urgent business in the south.
- I'm sorry, I can't help you there.
Supposing I was to ask you... as a stranger going to the west... to seek for that which was lost.
What would you say then?
I should answer,
"Where do you come from?"
From the east, and I am hoping that you will give my message... on the square for the sake of the widow's son.
Which lodge do you hail from?
Travelling Lodge 3276, the Fore and Fit.
The Queen's Own Royal Loyal
Light Infantry, Regimental District 329A.
- To whom shall I deliver the message?
- Daniel Dravot.
- Dravot?
- Yes.
A big man with long gray sideboards.
A great swell he is.
You'll find him surrounded by his luggage in a first-class compartment.
But don't you be afraid, just slip the window down and say:
"Peachy's gone south for the week."
Peachy's gone south for the week.
Yes, and he'll tumble.
Well, I'll be getting off now before we reach the station.
By the way, brother Carnehan...
I missed my watch in the station at Lahore... before boarding the train.
How was I to know you were a Mason?
Oh!
What's this?
God's holy trousers, tickets again?
Is your name Dravot, sir?
Hm?
I'm to say that Peachy has gone south for the week.
He's gone south for the week.
Did he say I was to give you anything for telling me this? Because I won't.
- No, he didn't.
- Then why did you do it?
For the sake of the widow's son.
Oh.
- He said south, did he?
- Yes.
Then that'll be Degumber.
Since you're a pal of Peachy's,
I don't mind telling you.
We're going to put the screw on the rajah for what he did to his mother-in-law.
Filled her with red peppers, hung her over a beam and flogged her to death.
You mean to say that you intend to blackmail him?
Man, you wouldn't get out of Degumber alive.
If they don't cut your throats, they'll certainly poison you.
Both's been tried more than once, but Peachy and me, we don't kill easy.
But the rajah's an independent ruler, he answers to nobody. Ha, ha, ha.
How do you hope to put the screw on him?
By telling him we're correspondents for The Northern Star.
You can't. You can't do that.
You can't do that.
Because I am the correspondent of The Northern Star!
You what?
I'm the correspondent of The Northern Star!
What did you say, brother?
As you know, Kipling, we took them at the Degumber Border... so there's a question of jurisdiction involved.
But a charge of conspiracy to blackmail might be brought.
I didn't lay this information before you as a criminal prosecution, sir... only to save their lives.
Then may I ask what particular interest you have in these scoundrels?
Well, they... They happen to be...
Freemasons, like myself.
Freemasons?
Those chaps? I should think you'd strike them off your roll.
Once a Mason, always a Mason.
Never could understand how perfectly pukka chaps, like yourself... can go about on public occasions wearing aprons and sashes... shaking hands with total strangers.
Just what is Masonry, Kipling?
It's an ancient order dedicated to the brotherhood of man... under the all-seeing eye of God.
We should've done well to have left that sort of thing behind us in England.
It can never work here.
There are tales that it did work here before we ever came.
Some audacious scholars can even trace it back to the builders of Solomon's Temple.
Hm. Old wives' tales, I suspect.
Yes, in all likelihood, sir.
Well, let's have a look at your lodge brothers.
Right turn.
Halt.
Hats off.
You men are not under arrest... thanks to Mr. Kipling here, who happens to be a genuine correspondent... for The Northern Star.
But both of you richly deserve to be in jail.
I have your records before me.
There's everything in them... from smuggling to swindling to receiving stolen goods... to bare-faced blackmail.
Sir, I resent the accusation of blackmail.
It is blackmail to obtain money by threats of publishing information in a newspaper.
But what blackmail is there in accepting a small retainer... for keeping it out of a newspaper?
And how did you propose to keep it out?
By telling the editor what I know about his sister... and a certain government official in these parts.
Let him put that in his paper if he has need of news.
It would have been wiser if you had gone home at the end of your army service.
Home to what?
A porter's uniform outside a restaurant and tanner tips from belching civilians... for closing doors on them and their blowzy women?
Not after watching Afghans come howling down out of the hills... and taking battlefield command when the officers had copped it.
Well said, brother Dravot.
There may be no criminal charges against you... but I'll see these files reach Calcutta... with the recommendation that you be deported as political undesirables.
Detriments to the dignity of the Empire and the izzat of the Raj.
Detriments you call us? Detriments?
I want to remind you it was detriments like us... that built this bloody Empire and the izzat of the bloody Raj.
Hats on.
About turn.
By the left, quick march.
Left... turn.
There's no need to let any of this get into the Star...
- ...I take it, Kipling?
- Huh?
No, no.
Copy.
My God. You two.
What do you want this time?
We want to ask you a favor.
Another favor?
Calm yourself, brother Kipling... we've never taken advantage of a fellow in the craft.
We don't want money, just a little of your time... a look at a book or two, study of your maps.
We'll take a drink if one's being offered, but we won't be put out if one isn't.
Peachy here is as sober as I am.
It's important you have no doubts on that score.
So we'll take one of your cigars apiece... and you shall watch us light up.
And now, sir, let me introduce you to brother Peachy Carnehan, which is him.
And brother Daniel Dravot, which is I.
The less said about our professions, the better... for we have been most things in our time.
We've been all over India... we know her cities, her jungles, her jails and her passes... and we have decided that she isn't big enough for such as we.
That's what I understood the commissioner to say.
Therefore, we are going away to another place... where a man isn't crowded and can come into his own.
We're not little men.
So we're going away to be kings.
Kings of Kafiristan.
Oh. Kafiristan?
We hear they have two and 30 idols there.
So we'll be the 33rd and 34th.
It's a place of warring tribes, which is to say... a land of opportunity for such as we... who know how to train men and lead them into battle.
We'll go there.
We'll say to any chief we can find:
"Do you want to vanquish your foes?"
"Of course," he'll say, "go to it."
We'll fight for him, make him king, then we'll subvert that king.
We'll seize his royal throne and loot the country four ways from Sunday.
How's that for a plan?
You're both out of your minds.
To start with... the only way to get there is through Afghanistan. Hm!
Kafiristan? No, no, no.
Two white men on their own would be cut to pieces... before they were five miles into the Khyber Pass.
Just suppose we managed it.
Just suppose, and suppose we got across the Afghan plains, then what?
There's the Hindu Kush... a frozen sea of peaks and glaciers.
A party of geographers, a mapping expedition... tried several years ago and vanished into thin air.
No white man has ever been there and come out since Alexander.
Alexander who?
Alexander the Great, King of Greece... about 300 years before Christ.
Well, if a Greek can do it, we can do it.
Right.
I can only repeat, you're a pair of lunatics.
Would a pair of lunatics draw up a contract like this?
"This contract between me and you..." pursuing witnesseth here in the name of God, Amen, and so forth.
One: That you and me will settle this matter together... i. e., to be Kings of Kafiristan.
Two: That you and me will not, while this matter is being settled... look at any liquor nor any woman, black, white or brown... so as to get mixed up with one or the other harmful.
Three: That we conduct ourselves with dignity and discretion... and if one of us gets into trouble, the other one will stay by him.
"Signed by you and me this day."
There's no need for the last article, but it's got a ring to it.
Daniel?
Now, you witness it and it's legal.
Well, gentlemen, it's 4 in the morning.
Don't you stand on politeness, brother Kipling.
If you want to go to bed, we won't steal anything.
Well, thank you.
We'll send word when we're ready to push off... in case you want to bid us a fond goodbye.
Yes, well, try not to burn the place down.
Here we are.
"Kafiristan, 10,000 square miles, mountainous terrain..." religion unknown, population unknown.
Conquered by Alexander in 328 B.C.
According to Herioditus... he defeated King Ox Y-Artes...
"...whose daughter Roxanne he subsequently took to wife."
Buy for your wife, sir?
Hee-yah!
If you buy from me, sir,
I make you very good price, sir.
Very cheap, very nice thing for you.
Specially for you, sir.
Hee-yah, hee-yah, hee-yah.
Our forward continuance is impeded by this fellow, sir, who is begging the sahib... that you will accompany with him that he may show to you a rare...
- ...and wonderful thing.
- Thing? What thing?
Indeed, the man would not say what thing.
Therefore, sahib, sir,
I suspect his bad intentions... to entice the sahib into a naughty house of disreputation... where he will take you and kill you and murder you... and cut your throat and rob the money from your pockets also.
Crikey, wait for me at the office.
But, sir, please. Sahib, myself, I will take you to a loving house. More better.
You will be very happy and delightful.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Morning to you, brother.
Glad you stopped by and caught the matinée performance.
- What'd you think of it?
- It's convincing enough... but what the devil are you two rascals up to now?
Last week it was kings you were to be, of Kafiristan, as I remember.
Right, but we've gotta get there first.
Madness is a trick.
Who'd hurt some poor crazy priest and his servant, hm?
Peachy worked out this dodge. We've used it before. He's good with the lingo.
He does the talking while I act dumb and balmy.
I've got so I can do the clowning pretty good.
I can twitch so as to put the fear of Allah into any good Muslim.
I can froth at the mouth something horrid. Want to see?
Well, I can imagine.
All right, then.
Some other time, perhaps.
Come over here.
Give it a touch up down here.
- Rifles?
- Martinis, 20 of them and ammunition.
Cost us every sou we squeezed out of the Raj of Degumber.
Good heavens.
- You mean, you went back there?
- Of course, brother Kipling.
Heaven help you if you're caught with those at the border.
Gun-running isn't exactly new to us.
Well, brother Kipling, goodbye and many thanks.
Man, don't do it.
The odds are too great.
Wish us luck. We met upon the level.
And we're parting on the square.
Good luck indeed.
Come along, you ugly beast.
Wait.
Here, take this.
Last time Danny and me came through the Khyber Pass... we fought our way, yard by bloody yard.
And General Bobbs called us heroes afterwards.
But that was years ago... and times have changed.
Blast. Look who's on sentry.
Mulvaney.
That loud-mouthed Mick from the Black Tyrone.
Private Mulvaney.
Come to attention when I am addressing you.
Slope arms.
Present arms.
Mark time.
At the double.
Corporal of the Guard.
Take three men and put Private Mulvaney under close arrest.
Bloody man's drunk again.
We came through the Khyber with that caravan... doing all sorts of antics to amuse the people.
At night he told them their fortunes in a tongue of his own devising... and I translated.
And all concerned were happy... because I promised them that all their wishes would come true.
Oh!
Then at Jaedallak... we turned off towards Kafiristan.
They were sad to see us leave the caravan.
We'd brought it good luck.
Two she-camels had been foaled and there was no sniping at us from the hills.
They waved goodbye to the mad priest and his servant.
And Danny danced them out of sight.
The country was deserty, the inhabitants was dispersed and solitary.
We traveled by night and kept away from villages... as we didn't want to waste ammunition in idle fighting with Afghans.
The Pushtukan.
A little wavy blue line on the map... but we couldn't hope to get the camels across.
So Peachy says to Danny,
"It doesn't matter what they cost us... in the Lahore Bazaar.
We'll trade them for goats."
We're playing for very high stakes.
Pipe Major McCrimmon bet me ten bob once... he could blow up a whole goatskin with one breath... and he did.
Though he'd sat down on an anthill in his kilt unknowing-like.
Ten shillings. It was ten shillings to Pipe Major McCrimmon.
Mules.
Now... the problem is... how to divide five Afghans from three mules... and have two Englishmen left over.
Shoot them out their saddles.
No, the mules would bolt.
Sit over there, Danny.
So we starts forward, into those bitter cold mountainous parts... and never a path broader than the back of your hand.
The mountains was tall and white... like wild rams.
They was always fighting so you couldn't sleep at night for the din of their fighting.
The son of God goes forth to war
A kingly crown to gain
His blood-red banner streams afar
Who follows in his train?
For God's sake, Danny, pipe down.
Why? Who's going to hear us up here?
These mountains, that's who.
Do you want to start an avalanche?
God, you don't believe that kind of foolishness, I hope.
If a king can't sing, it ain't worth being king.
A glorious band, the chosen few...
The country was most mountainous and the mules was most contrary.
They all died but one, and she died later on.
Danny went snow-blind and clung to Jenny's tail.
Up and up we went... and down, and down, through defiles... and over snowy saddles, till all at once... two giants stood in our way.
God's holy trousers.
What's the matter, Peachy?
Blokes twice our size, standing guard in the snow, like.
- Two of them.
- Give them a round apiece.
Not a move out of them.
Stay put.
I'll reconnoiter.
They're not real, thank God.
They're horrible.
Put there by the Kafiris to frighten the neighbors, no doubt.
Peachy... that means we're in Kafiristan or almost.
So it does.
What was that?
Our bridges have been burnt, so to speak.
What do you mean?
The bridge we crossed by ain't there no longer.
What?
Now what?
Well, tell me.
A crevasse.
We've had it, Danny, coming and going.
- Wide?
- Wide enough.
It drops into nothing below, straight as a beggar can spit.
That's the last of them Peachy.
No more gods to burn.
It looks like "Last Post," Danny.
I don't fancy dying by inches... feeling the cold creeping up my arms and legs, getting all numb.
I'll do the necessary when the fire goes out.
Fair enough.
Ain't it a bloody shame though, eh?
Our getting this close and not making it.
A stone's throw away, our kingdom.
I'd have like to seen you, Danny, with a gold crown on your head... if you could've found one that fitted it.
Peachy, in your opinion... have our lives been misspent?
Well, that depends on how you look at it.
I wouldn't say the world's a better place for our having lived in it.
No, hardly that.
Nobody's gonna weep their eyes out at our demise.
And who'd want them to anyway?
And we haven't many good deeds to our credit.
None. None to brag about.
But how many men have been where we've been... and seen what we've seen?
Bloody few, and that's a fact.
Why, even now, I wouldn't change places with the viceroy himself... if it meant giving up my memories.
Me neither.
Do you remember the time the Highlanders was retreating down the hill...
- ...at Ali Masjid...
- Ali Masjid.
And Pipe Major McCrimmon got his sporran shot off? Ha, ha, ha.
Half a crown was in it, right?
So back he goes after it without even looking to see if that was all he'd lost.
- And then he got the Victoria Cross...
- Victoria Cross.
Because the bloody Highlanders turned around and followed him up the hill.
Danny.
We could get on.
Kafiristan.
The promised land.
Hee-yah!
Must be their Halloween.
Upsadaisy, lad.
Brass band and all.
Hail the conquering heroes.
Bloody cheek.
Where's their gratitude?
I say...
I say there...
Are you Englishmen, please?
Stone the bleeding crows.
Yes, mate.
And who might you be?
Peachy, it's a Gurkha.
Rifleman Machendra Bahadur Garung, known to my regimen as Billy Fish.
Is that right?
Well, report, rifleman. What are you doing here, wherever here is?
I come with Colonel Robertson, sir.
The geographer's party?
Dear me, alas, by Jove.
Party not reaching Er Heb for very misfortunate reasons.
Large mountain is falling on the heads of Colonel Robertson and others.
Everybody buried alive, except your servant.
What about them up there, banging drums and blowing horns... and then shooting arrows at us?
Oh. Big noise, intended to scare away devils.
Many devils here these days, you know?
They thought we was devils?
Kafiristan peoples very ignorant.
I say to Headman Ootah...
I say, oh, no, by Jove, they're not devils... they gorasahibs,
British soldiers.
Good man, Billy Fish.
And now, if you will take us to this Ootah bloke... we will begin his education.
Ootah!
Ootah!
Ootah!
Ootah!
Tell him we won't hurt him, not to worry.
He wants to know where you come from.
Tell him we tumbled from the skies.
He wants to know are you gods?
Not gods, Englishmen, which is the next best thing.
I ofttimes tell Ootah about Englishmans... how they give names to dogs and take off hats to womans... and march into battle, left, right, with rifles on their shoulders.
Bringing enlightenment to the darker regions of the earth.
He wants to know how rifle works.
Show him, Peachy.
We are not gods exactly... but we are heaven-sent to deliver you from your enemies.
Enemies all around.
The Bashkai are the worst.
Whole town comes out and pisses downstream when we go bathing.
Shocking.
They are always killing our womans.
Putting on masks... so Er Heb chap is thinking them devils and running like the bloody hell away.
War. Red war we'll give them.
He says he give you two goats for each Bashkai man you're killing.
One goat for each womans and childs.
A handsome offer.
But rather than knocking them over one at a time... we'd like to do the whole thing in one foul swoop.
Serve him up a proper victory.
Storm Bashkai, take the city.
He says how much for all that?
Only the honor... of leading the brave men of Er Heb into battle.
Plus whatever we may fancy in the way of souvenirs.
A bauble here and a bangle there.
Bashkai is only the beginning.
We hope to go on from victory to victory... until he runs out of enemies.
And a monarch of all you survey.
All he surveys?
From the highest place in the valley.
The mountains will echo your name.
Ootah the Great.
He says he prefers Ootah the Terrible.
Then Ootah the Terrible it shall be.
And take him in token of our earnest.
And now the womans of Er Heb will cut his bullocks off. Ha, ha, ha.
Couldn't happen in a better cause.
- Contract.
- Contract.
Ootah say, "You no like?"
Tell His Highness we've given up strong drink... until we've conquered all his enemies.
Boil them once or twice in hot water and they'll come out like chicken and ham.
You wouldn't know them from the Gaiety chorus.
Ootah says take your pick.
He does?
Tell His Majesty... one's prettier than another.
I couldn't choose.
Take two, take three, take as many as you like.
There are more where they came from.
He has 27 daughters.
They're his daughters?
His own daughters?
The dirty old brute.
Different countries, different customs.
Mustn't be prejudiced, Peachy.
Thank His Majesty but tell him we've also taken a vow... not to dally with females till all his enemies are vanquished.
He has 32 sons if you're liking boys.
Tell him he makes my gorge to rise.
Go on.
Hold on, Peachy, he's only being hospitable according to his likes.
Polo.
Everything's the same as ours except the ball. It's bigger.
Do they always use that bigger ball?
It depend on size of man's head. Big head, big ball. This your Bashkai man.
Big damn head.
The bloody heathens.
Different countries, different customs.
Mustn't be prejudiced, Danny.
Now, listen to me, you benighted muckers.
We're gonna teach you soldiering, the world's noblest profession.
When we've done with you, you'll be able to stand up... and slaughter your enemies like civilized men.
But first, you'll have to learn to march in step.
Do the manual of arms without even having to think.
Good soldiers don't think, they just obey.
Do you suppose if a man thought twice, he'd give his life for queen and country?
Not bloody likely.
He wouldn't go near the battlefield.
One look at your foolish faces... tells me you're going to be crack troops.
Him there with a five-and-a-half hat size has the makings of a bloody hero.
Now the timing in the British army has always been one, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Ready, steady, go.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
You say it at the same time as all the others, right?
Tell him to say it the same time as all the others.
Right. Go.
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Billy, tell him to say it with the others.
With the others.
One, two, three.
All right. Now ready, steady, go.
One, two, three.
You don't say it before the others.
He's saying it before the others, Billy.
Not before the others, not after the others. With the bloody others.
Right. Attention.
Now, you, look...
That one goes to there.
Say that one goes to there, that's it.
Down there like that.
There we are. You okay? Right.
Blimey.
Come on, smarten up, you horrible lot.
Attention.
That's better.
Troops, march.
Regiment, quick march.
Left, left, left, right, left.
Now, wait a minute, ducks, you're a handsome piece, that I don't deny... but the contract clearly states... that the party of the first part, which is Danny... and the party of the second part, which is me... shall nowise compromise ourselves... with parties of the third part, which is you.
All binding, properly sworn to... witnessed and attested.
- Danny.
- Shaw.
Thank God you arrived.
Let's go and seek safety in battle.
Trumpeter, sound your trumpet.
Billy Fish.
Blood is what we want, the bloodier the better. So see that it is so.
So it shall be, huzoor.
Like old times, Peachy.
Reminds me of Ali Masjid.
It's a good job, the odds are only 10-to-1.
Halt.
Line up in a straight line here.
Present.
Aim!
Who are they?
What's happening?
Very holy men. They make walks through all Kafiristan... collecting offerings for Holy City.
Battle is postponed... until priests are passed.
Why have they got their eyes closed?
They do not wish to see any badness, so keep eyes closed... until they return to beauties of Sikandergul.
Fire!
Aim! Fire!
Reload!
Forward!
Mutiny!
The great bloody show-off.
Rifle section, form line.
Fix bayonets.
Advance.
Volley fire.
Commence fire.
Charge!
And what, may I ask, did you think you were playing at... charging the enemy single-handed?
I got carried away, heat of the moment, the blood was up.
Acting like some green lieutenant hoping to be mentioned in dispatches.
A man of your age, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Sorry.
Supposing you got killed?
Supposing that? Where would I be at?
It won't happen again.
See it don't. And what are you carrying that arrow around for?
- No particular reason.
- I've never seen anything like it in me life.
Hold on, laddy buck. What's he up to?
He say he great warrior.
He win this big battle... and now according to custom he lop off their heads.
Great warrior, eh? Well, I never saw him in the thick of the fray.
There'll be no execution of prisoners in this army.
Tell him to put that sword away.
He says once sword unsheathed, it must taste blood.
Just as I thought, he hasn't had it out until now.
He says watch out or he get very angry and lop your head off.
All right, up you get, off your hunkers.
No more groveling.
We ain't gonna put your city to the torch... or hang you in chains nor rape your daughters.
Tell them to divide their goods in half... and we will choose which half we want, in the way of spoils.
Henceforth, let the men of Er Heb and the men of Bashkai be as brothers.
Brothers in arms.
Let them march together under one banner... and share and share alike in the victories to come.
Have the Bashkai any enemies to speak of?
Oh, enemies all around.
The Bhardoks, the Ghundaras, the Shus, the Khawaks.
The Bhardoks people coming out and pissing downstream on Bashkai people... when they go bathing.
Shocking.
We'll strike them down and grind them into dust.
Silver bracelet, ten shillings.
A good heavy necklace of the same, worth a fiver at least.
Earring with bangles.
One pig sticker with plain handle.
A gold coin, worn pretty thin.
A rosy red ring and a few other ones, plain.
The whole lot should fetch ten or fifteen quid in an able shop in London.
Not too bad for the back of beyond.
Sikander, Sikander, Sikander.
They're calling for you.
For me?
Sikander, Sikander, Sikander.
Sikander. Sikander.
What does Sikander mean, Billy?
Sikander a god.
Come here long ago from the west.
Yeah, that'll be the Greek bloke brother Kipling told us about.
Alexander?
Alexander. Sikander.
Yeah. Alexander.
He builded great city...
Sikandergul, high in mountains.
Sit on throne, all peoples worship him.
Then one day, time comes, he say he must go to east.
People pull their hairs out, tear clothes... so Sikander promise to send back son.
328 B.C... the encyclopedia said.
Soldiers saw arrow go into Danny's chest... him pluck it out and not bleeding.
So?
So son of Sikander.
They think I'm a god?
A god. Put your foot out that I may kiss your big toe.
You may kiss my royal arse.
Not royal, holy.
You're a deity, remember?
- Peachy?
- Yes, Billy.
Is Danny not son of Sikander?
No, Billy, he's a man like you and me.
He can break wind at both ends simultaneous.
Which, I'm willing to bet, is more than any god can do.
But the arrow...
The arrow stuck in the bandoleer.
There was no miracle, Billy, so you'd better tell them out there.
And my dad's name was
Herbert Dravot, Esquire... and he was bar steward in a knocking shop in Durham.
Hang on a minute, Danny.
Maybe we're missing a bet here.
What do you mean?
Supposing you was an ignorant Kafiri... who would you rather follow, a god or a man?
Now, we're here to conquer this country, ain't we?
Well, with you as a god, it would take half the time and half the trouble.
The idea's a bit blasphemous-like.
No, Danny, blaspheming is when you take his name in vain...
God Almighty's.
And what if they found out we was having them on?
Why should they? We won't tell them.
And you won't tell them, will you, Billy?
Oh, no, indeed by Jove, no.
Polo?
Polo.
Er Heb and Bashkai people celebrate new brotherhood.
- With whose head?
- Ootah's.
We marched and fought and took more villages.
Our ranks swelled.
They were well-trained and disciplined... but with Danny at their head,
Sikander the Second... they were also inspired.
Sikander, Sikander, Sikander.
After half a dozen victories... his fame was such that there was no more fighting.
We was met with gifts and bevies of maidens... who danced and threw flowers.
Girl.
Venus de Milo in the flesh, if flesh it is, and not Guinness and champagne.
Billy, tell her to stand up and turn around.
Just gazing, Peachy, just gazing.
There's such a thing as enjoying beauty for its own sake.
Being only human... one thing leads to another.
Give her a hat with an ostrich feather in it... and there'll be no girl in Brighton on a bank holiday could hold a candle to her.
I must admit... she really is an eyeful.
What's your name, girl?
Roxanne.
- Roxanne.
- Hey.
Wasn't that the name of the princess that Alexander married?
It was that.
Hold your head up.
- Girl afraid.
- Of what?
If god takes a girl, she catches fire and go up in smoke.
They do what?
God's heart a burning torch, his veins run fire, not blood.
If god makes love to girl, she goes "Kaa-choom!"
In one flash. Not even any ashes left.
I bet that was made up by some jealous goddess.
They come from Holy City of Sikandergul... with a message for the one who calls himself Son of Sikander.
Tell them they're looking at him, or would be if they opened their eyes.
The message comes from Kafu Selim.
- Who?
- Kafu Selim.
High priest of all Kafiristan.
What's the message?
Kafu Selim says come.
Come?
- Is that all?
- That's all, just come.
Doesn't waste words, does he?
You tell Kafu Selim that we appreciate the invitation... and that we will avail ourselves of it one of these days.
- No, come means come now, today.
- Oh.
What does he want to see us about, or didn't he say?
He just says come.
I see.
All right, well, tell him to stand by... and the army will be ready by first light.
He says no. You come alone, him and you.
Without the army?
You tell Kafu Selim or whatever his name is...
Peachy and me don't go anywhere without the army goes with us.
Shut up, Danny.
We have to go.
Have you gone starky?
Keep your voice down and put a smile on your face.
We've got an audience, remember?
Peachy, we'd be stone bonkers... to walk into a strange city by our lonesomes.
Either we do what they say or we pull stumps and run.
Make a beeline for the mountains as soon as it's dark... and never look back at Kafiristan.
Run? Not bloody likely.
Run from the likes of them?
No... from our blokes.
We're over a barrel, Danny.
If we break away from a meeting with old Kafu Selim... we'll lose face and that is the one thing a god cannot afford.
What to do?
Bluff it out.
Polish our buttons and leather, stuff ramrods up our jacksies and look bold.
Like we did when we were on charges for drunk and resisting the guard.
Sikandergul.
God's holy trousers.
No weapons allowed in holy city.
All right, you've got us here.
Now what? Hm?
Where's your High Panjandrum? Hm?
Afternoon, Your Reverence.
You said you wanted to see me?
Tell him he can keep it, Billy.
Tell him I'm making him a present of it.
What did he say, Billy?
He say now we shall see.
You mortals wait down there.
Tell your filthy sods to take their paws off me double quick... or by God,
I'll have their guts for garters!
I'll pluck out your livers and feed them to the kites.
How dare you lay your hands on me...
Daniel Dravot, Esquire.
Sikander.
Sikander.
Sikander.
Now what the bleeding hell?
One minute he's about to cut my bloody heart out... the next minute he's flat on his bleeding face.
He saw that... and he dropped like he was poleaxed.
What do you make of it?
He says that is mark of Sikander.
They're Masons.
By the square, by the level, by the plumb rule, by the compasses... and by the all-seeing eye.
The craft, Danny, the craft.
- That's what saved us.
- Blimey.
Only highest of high priests knows about this sign... put in stone long ago by Sikander.
Now Kafu Selim rejoicing at the coming of his son.
Sikander, Sikander, Sikander!
It ain't brass, Danny.
Sikander?
Belong to Sikander, now Son of Sikander's.
These here make the jewels in the Tower of London... look like cheap family heirlooms.
God's holy trousers.
Look at the size of that ruby.
There's a bigger one.
Why, Danny, we only have to fill our pockets and walk out of here... to be millionaires.
And all of it... all... would make us the two richest men in England.
- The Empire.
- The world.
But will they let us take it?
Take it away, I mean?
Ask him, Billy.
He says belong to Son of Sikander, can do with it what he likes.
Leave it here, take away, no matter.
His will be done.
We've mules enough, thank God... and riflemen to guard them when the time comes.
What month is it?
January, I make it, or maybe February.
March, April, May, June... four months of winter monsoon, then...
Four long months.
What'll we do with the time?
Add up our blessings here... divide them by two... not forgetting you, Billy... and multiply that by the years we've got left.
Tell His Reverence... he has my thanks... for discharging his trust so correctly... and delivering to me what is mine.
And tell him I'm also grateful to all them other holy men... who waited for me, from one generation to another... down the centuries to this present day and fortuitous occasion.
My lord, these people are from village of Kamdesh.
This man owns 60 cows... all cows in the village.
Very enterprising of him.
Enterprise is not his, enterprise is hers.
She's his wife, you see, and every time he catches her with other mans... other mans has to pay a forfeit of six cows. Is Kafiri custom.
Use other man's wife, pay him six cows.
You mean, he's piled up a fortune of 60 cows out of her infidelities?
And 32 goats.
- She ain't a wife, she's a going concern.
- Ha.
And these are the unfaithful husbands?
And these the wives?
Those four wives of one man.
These three wives of another.
Those six of another.
This ain't no laughing matter.
Without cattle, there ain't no meat, nor hides, nor hooves, nor horns.
Without milk there ain't no butter nor cheese and the children's bowls go empty.
Outrageous it is.
Now, for encouraging his wife to comport herself like Jezebel... one cow shall be paid each of the other wives.
For using a good law for a bad purpose, another.
For causing the young and innocent to go without, a third.
And for thinking he can get away with it, a fourth.
He shall pay 22 cases of compensation... of four cows to each wife.
Which means, she's got...
Fourteen and two-thirds.
Fourteen and two-thirds more infidelities to commit, to come out even.
Let her husband see how he likes it when she's earning cows for somebody else.
Next case.
What's the charge?
No charge, this chief from Agatsi... which village have big fire and winter supply of grains go up in smoke.
Now chief want permission to raid another village for to steal grain.
They don't have to raid and they won't starve neither.
Make a proclamation, Billy.
What number is it?
Thirty-one, my lord.
Each and every village will bring one-tenth of its crop here... to my royal city of Sikandergul... where same will be suitably stored.
Henceforth, any village suffering from privation... shall have grain issued to it in accordance with its needs.
I now pronounce this law enacted.
Selah.
I also pronounce a five-minute recess in this durbar.
Yes, my lord.
If we're gonna make it stick that I'm a god... you ought to bow when you pass in front of me like everybody else.
All right, Danny.
You understand, for appearance's sake.
Yeah.
No offense.
No, no, of course not, Danny.
You'd have to take your hat off to Daniel Dravot.
He dealt out justice as though he wrote the book.
Peachy was the general of all his armies... but there was no more battles to be fought.
So Danny put him to building a bridge... that would span the chasm below the holy city.
It'd help keep Peachy occupied till the spring came.
Look, Danny, the geese.
Skeins of them flying north.
Another fortnight and the pass will be open.
Now, what we ought to do is make camp high up on the mountain... and wait on the weather.
- I ain't going, Peachy.
- What?
You heard me.
- Not going?
- Correct.
Have you gone barmy?
No. I ain't been drinking neither.
I see things clear.
It's like bandages have been removed from my eyes.
Have you ever walked into a strange room...
And it's like you've been there before?
- I know what you mean, yes.
- Let me tell you something.
This isn't the first time
I wore a crown.
There's more to this than meets the eye.
It all adds up.
What does?
Everything that's happened from the time we decided to come here.
No, before that... beginning with your taking brother Kipling's watch.
More than chance has been at work here.
More than mere chance.
Why his watch and not somebody else's?
And what made him give me the emblem?
One thing after the other.
The avalanche, the arrow... the mark on the stone, and not to mention, another Roxanne.
Roxanne?
The Venus de Milo?
The same.
One more thing is needful for my destiny to be fulfilled.
That I take her to wife.
For God's sake, leave the women alone.
Who's talking of women? I said wife.
A queen to breed a king's son for the king.
What about the contract?
The contract only lasted until such time as we was kings... and king I've been these months past.
The first king here since Alexander, the first to wear his crown in 2200 and...
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen years.
Him... and now me.
They call me his son and I am... in spirit, anyway.
It's a hugeous responsibility.
The bridge we're building, it's only the first of many.
They'll tie the country together.
A nation I shall make of it, with an anthem and a flag.
I shall treat on equal terms the viceroy and other kings and princes.
And when I've accomplished what I set out to do...
I'll stand one day before the queen... not kneel, mind you, but stand like an equal.
And she'll say, "I'd like you to accept the Order of the Garter..." as a mark of my esteem, cousin."
And she'll pin it on me herself.
It's big, I tell you, it's big.
And I tell you, you need a physic.
I'm fair disappointed in you, Peachy.
You of all men... who followed me and helped to make me what I am.
Followed you? Me? Who had hold of the mule's tail, tell me that?
The jenny also done her bit.
Danny. Danny, we've had this rare streak of luck.
Let's quit winners for once.
Cut and run while the running's good.
You call it luck.
- I call it destiny.
- Ha, ha.
Pardon me while I fall down laughing.
Whatever you may think... and however you may feel,
I'm a king and you're a subject.
So don't you provoke me,
Peachy Carnehan.
Or you'll do what?
You've got me trembling in my boots here. What'll you do?
You have our permission to bugger off.
That I'll do, with or without your bleeding permission.
And may you rot in hell, Daniel Dravot.
From Sikander the First... to Sikander the Second... was a long time between kings... and a country needs a king, like a king needs a crown.
The one is the glory of the other.
Therefore, I shall leave a son behind me... who will, in his turn, beget other sons... so the royal succession will be unbroken... and kings will be guaranteed to you forever.
To which end...
I have chosen a wife.
Roxanne of Khawak.
Let her be brought here, attended by members of her family.
I want flowers strewed along her way... and the wedding ceremony will be surrounded by pomp and circumstance.
Let messengers be sent forth and summon my people from near and far.
Selah.
What are they saying, Billy Fish?
How can daughters of men marry gods or devils?
- A god can do anything.
- But it is not proper.
Who says it isn't?
All the priests.
Would they put their word against that of a god?
They say let Imbra decide.
Imbra is highest god of all.
And what if Imbra should hold against me?
What'll they do about it?
Am I a dog or a god?
Haven't I put the shadow of my hand over this country?
Do as I say. Send for the girl.
Tell them that's an order.
Well, Billy, what's going on?
Signs very bad, Peachy.
Priests open up birds, all green inside and stinking most horrid.
Imbra very angry.
They probably cut the spleen, the green's only bile.
Don't worry, Billy... the girl won't go up in smoke,
I'll guarantee you that.
Girl don't matter... many girls here, no difference.
Few girls more or less.
But cows now, they dry up... and goats throw babies too soon.
And corn do not ripen.
Everybody go hungry.
Now, Billy, you know as well as I do... that Dravot's no god.
He himself told you about the arrow.
But then priests must be mistaken about Imbra.
He not angry because... god marrying a mortal... but because son of man pretend to be a god.
Roxanne, don't be afraid...
I wouldn't harm you.
When the time comes, you'll catch fire, I warrant... like all women should when their husbands hold them close.
But you won't perish, girl,
I promise you that.
Well, Danny... the time has come, as the saying goes.
When do you leave?
At first light.
I thought you might like to take a peek in the boxes before I nail them shut... see what I'm taking.
Take what you like.
I weighed the gold out, pound for pound.
The gems, ounce for ounce, every jot and tittle.
Right.
I'll only need half the mules we planned... but I would like to take all 20 riflemen... to see me safe through the Khyber Pass.
Take them. Take them.
God's holy trousers.
What is that?
They're savages here, one and all.
Leave them to go back to slaughtering babes... and playing stick and ball with one and other's heads... and pissing on their neighbors.
Please, Danny... for the last time of asking... come back with me.
For the last time of answering, I won't.
Peachy, I know you've got my best interests at heart... but the choice has been made.
Well, I'll be seeing you, then.
In London maybe... when the queen gives you the Order of the Garter.
Peachy?
- Yes, Danny.
- I'm to be married mid-morning.
Could you not wait and leave afterwards?
See me up the aisle for old times' sake,
If you like.
Peachy, the ring.
I, Sikander the Second, hereby take thee, Roxanne... to be my lawful wedded wife... and Queen of Kafiristan.
Selah.
She bit me.
The slut bit me.
What's he saying, Billy?
Danny's bleeding. They know.
He says not god, not devil, but man.
They've twigged it, Danny. You've had it.
The jig's up.
- I, Sikander...
- For God's sake.
We've got to brass it out, Danny.
Danny, brass it out.
Bags of swank.
We'll get your riflemen, Peachy, we'll come back and slaughter the dogs.
A drenching in their own blood, we'll give them.
Riflemen, prepare to advance.
Too many for that, Danny.
Retire in sections.
Retire? Retire be damned.
We've gotta make a run for it.
Front section.
Fire!
Back!
Front rank. Fire!
Back!
Break ranks!
Billy Fish, mount the mule and ride.
There's a chance you'll make it.
Gurkha foot soldier, not cavalry.
Rifleman Machendra Bahadur Garung wishing you many good lucks.
- Out of bloody ammo.
- Me too.
Peachy, I'm heartily ashamed for getting you killed... instead of going home rich like you deserved to... on account of me being so bleeding high and bloody mighty.
Can you forgive me?
That I can... and that I do, Danny.
Free and full and without let or hindrance.
Everything's all right, then.
The son of God goes forth to war
A kingly crown to gain
His blood-red banner...
Cut you buggers, cut.
A glorious band, the chosen few
On whom the spirit came
Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew
And mocked the cross and flame
He met the tyrant's brandished steel
The lion's gory mane
He bowed his head, his death to feel
Who followed in his train?
And old Danny fell... round and round and round and round... like a penny whirligig.
Twenty thousand miles.
For it took him half an hour to fall before he struck the rocks.
And do you know what they did to Peachy?
They crucified him, sir... between two pine trees... as Peachy's hands... will show.
Poor Peachy, who'd never done them any harm.
He just hung there and he screamed, but he didn't die.
And the next day they come and they took him down and they said... it was a miracle he wasn't dead, and they let him go.
And Peachy come home in about a year... and the mountains, they tried to fall on old Peachy... but he was quite safe because
Daniel walked before him.
And Daniel never... let go... of Peachy's hand... and Peachy never let go... of Daniel's head.
His head?
- You knew Danny, sir.
- Oh, yes.
You knew... most worshipful brother...
Daniel Dravot, Esquire.
Well, he became... the King of Kafiristan... with a crown on his head.
And that's all there is to tell.
I'll be on my way now, sir.
I've got urgent business in the south.
I have to meet a man at Marwar Junction.
- Ouch!
- Shh.
I bumped my knee.
Who cares about your dumb old knee?
Now be quiet and stay down. OK?
What are you doing that for?
- 'Cause thaùs what they always do.
- Who?
The Indians.
Now you stay here.
I'll tell you when to come, OK?
- [Dog barks]
- Ah, Boots.
Stay down, OK?
Shh.
Quiet, Boots.
Shh.
No. Shh.
[Gutteridge] Boots, hush up out there.
[Continues barking]
Oh, Boots!
- [Gutteridge] You hear me, Boots?
- Get away.
[Gutteridge] Hush up out there.
Here. This oughta shut you up.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
How did he do that?
Sam!
Quick, take these. Hurry.
Well, if it isn't
Big Chief Red Top himself.
Don't see you since your ma's bargain hunting at the supermarket.
Yes, sir.
I mean, no, sir.
Everybody's squeezing out the small businessman, and those empties don't help.
It does seem to me I get more of these things back than I sell.
How's that grandpa of yours doing?
I haven't been to see him for awhile.
He's OK.
Well, thaùs six bottles. Be 12 cents.
- You want the usual?
- Yes, sir.
You should ask the lady what she wants.
She wants the same as me.
Samantha?
Thaùs right.
I want the same as him.
OK. Two suckers on the house, and the bottles and jelly beans.
But you better watch out, Napoleon.
When a woman agrees with everything you say, she's really got her eye out for you.
I don't think iùs right.
Iùs not stealing.
We gave him his bottles back.
But they were his bottles.
I don't eat the jelly beans myself.
They're for Charley.
Who's Charley?
Who's Charley?
Want to meet him?
Yeah.
OK. I'll take you.
But you gotta promise to help me on exams tomorrow.
I'm not supposed to.
Well, OK.
Good. Come on.
Here, Charley!
Over here, Charley.
Come on.
Over here, Charley.
Come on.
- Charley's a horse.
- Yeah.
- [Napoleon] Here, Charley.
- [Sam] He knows you.
Of course he does.
Here, Charley.
- What are you trying to do?
- I'm gonna get on him.
He's teaching me to ride so I can be a cowboy like my grandpa was.
Your grandpa was a cowboy?
Yep, and he's part Indian too.
I don't believe you.
You can't be an Indian and a cowboy.
My grandpa can.
Here, Charley. Come on.
[Napoleon] Here's your candy, Charley.
Come on.
He can carry the two of us.
- I can't ride.
- Just hold on, OK?
Come on.
Quick, before he finishes the candy.
Hurry. He's almost finished.
- Hold on tight. He's gonna go now.
- Where to?
Across the field to the water.
The candies make him thirsty.
Come on.
[Napoleon] Giddyup. Come on.
Giddyup, Charley.
Giddyup. Come on.
- [Napoleon] See, isn't it fun?
- [Sam] Yeah.
Aren't you supposed to have a saddle and a bridle?
No. Thaùs only for people who don't know how to ride.
- Giddyup.
- Come on, Charley!
[Napoleon] Thaùs it!
- He likes it.
- Yeah.
Come on.
- Thanks for the ride.
- Thanks a lot, Charley.
- You're the best horse.
- Goodbye.
- [Sam] Can you see her?
- There's nobody there.
- Good. She's probably still out.
- She ever hit you for being late?
No. I don't think housekeepers are allowed to.
She justjabbers at me a lot.
I better make a run for it, Napo...
Oh, hi, Gertrude.
So, you finally decided to come home.
Do you know what time it is?
- No, ma'am.
- [Gertrude] Iùs six o'clock.
I don't know what you've been doing, but leùs get one thing straight.
While your mother and father are away, and I'm responsible for you,
I expect to see you home by five.
Now, is that understood?
Yeah.
Go to your room and get changed.
You look like something the cat dragged in.
See you, Napoleon.
[Gertrude] What have you got all over your dress?
- [Sam] Iùs horse hair.
- [Gertrude] Horse hair!
Grandpa, I'm home!
I'm home, Grandpa!
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Ahoy, there, mate.
Hey, you're late.
You been behaving yourself?
I'm glad to hear that.
We've got to keep things ship-shape around here.
- Permission to speak, sir.
- [Seth] Permission granted.
All the other kids are going to the movies. Can we go?
Well, now, that depends.
Depends on what?
On whether or not you're going to give your grandpa's aching back a rub.
Sure.
- Go on now, get the liniment.
- OK.
[Seth chuckles]
Did Captain Morgan really die in a Spanish prison?
Not on your life. There wasn't a prison in the world could hold him.
There's nothing as tough as an old sea dog.
You think I could ever do all the things you did, Grandpa?
Well, if you eat your vittles, keep your curiosity up and your wits about you, you will.
[Flute music]
- What is it, Grandpa?
- Well, darned if I know.
[Music continues]
Step right up.
Join the celebration.
Iùs a real live lion!
Golly!
What are you celebrating?
We are celebrating an ending, my dear friends.
An ending? To what?
To a lifelong partnership.
Yes, and two glorious careers.
Oh, permit me.
Dimetri. The clown.
- [Drum roll]
- Da dah!
- I'm Seth Wilson.
- And I'm Napoleon.
And Major, the king of beasts.
[Dimetri] Won't you join us?
Please, I beg of you.
- Are you sure he won't object?
- Oh, no. He won't object.
He's the most kind and gentle king of beasts.
- Would you do the honors, please?
- The honors? Oh, yes.
[Dimetri] Have you seen such a thing?
[Dimetri laughs loudly]
So, you're retiring?
Dimetri is finally going home.
To Europe.
Is the lion going with you?
Well, that is the predicament.
- That is the sadness.
- [Seth] Why?
[Napoleon] Whaùs the matter?
Old friends should never be separated.
You can't take him with you?
No.
[Napoleon] What are you gonna do with him?
I am searching for a happy place.
Where his majesty will be treated like his majesty.
You tried a zoo?
I have, I have.
They have been very kind and helpful, but... they cannot find a place for an old milk-drinking lion.
An old veteran ofjoy.
Hey, my grandpa used to be a lion trainer.
That was a long time ago.
Did you work in the circus?
No. He trained lions for the Emperor of Ethiopia.
That was quite a long time ago,
Napoleon.
My dear friends...
My beloved friends.
The Major is yours.
You mean that... you're giving him to us?
Not I, but fate.
Oh, no. None of that.
We can't have a lion in our home.
[Napoleon] Why not?
Because he's a wild animal.
Thaùs why not.
He doesn't look very wild to me.
Besides, you said you were a lion trainer.
We can't have him.
He's too expensive.
We wouldn't be able to feed him.
He must eat like a...
No, no. Not Major.
He just drinks milk.
He has bad teeth.
Please!
No. We haven't got any place to keep a lion.
Yeah, we have. We have a cage.
Cage?
Gonna take at least a dozen quarts of milk to keep this boy going forjust one day.
Don't worry, Grandpa.
I'm going to save all my pocket money.
Just to buy milk.
Hold on, now. He isn't too well-acquainted with us yet.
He might be a little feisty in the mornings.
Oh, Grandpa.
He knows us.
He's part of our family now.
Here you are.
Look at him, Grandpa.
I am looking.
And I see a dozen quarts of milk.
What he's going to need is a whole cow.
- [Clucking]
- [Seth] Oh. Well.
One thing at least.
He started the hens back to laying.
Uh, uh!
Oh, Grandpa. Golly.
Well, I declare.
- Bye, Grandpa.
- You're off to school?
Don't dawdle on the way.
I don't want that teacher complaining about you again.
Bye, Major. Have a nice day.
See you when I come home.
- You'll watch him for me?
- Of course I will.
- And you remember what I told you.
- I will.
Don't gossip about him.
The authorities hear about him, they'll take him away. Darn busybodies.
Yeah.
Bye, Grandpa.
Drop this off in the post on your way, will you?
- Where's it going?
- New York.
Oh, yeah. Goodbye.
Yeah.
Thaùs right.
A couple of old timers, you and me.
- Leùs go see Charley.
- No, I gotta go home.
- Well, why?
- I just gotta. Thaùs why.
Want to come over to my house and play?
- No.
- Can I come to yours?
No!
I'm sorry.
- Now, can you keep a secret?
- You know I can.
- Then come on.
- Am I supposed to guess, or what?
You're not supposed to do anything.
You see it when you see it.
Iùs a real live lion!
His name is Major.
Think I could come in and pet him?
Come on in.
He won't hurt you. Pet him.
See? He's nice.
Sure is a nice lion.
Sure is.
Couldn't be any nicer.
He drinks milk.
Must drink an awful lot.
He does.
See? Look. See what he's doing?
He won't even...
26 quarts in three days?
Sure gonna make a dent in the pension check.
Oh, yeah. Thaùs right.
- There you are, Napoleon.
- Thanks, Mr. Gutteridge.
Thank you.
You know, Seth...
You're lookin' a mite peaked lately.
You feeling all right?
Right as rain, Amos.
It stands to reason with all that milk you've been drinking.
I'm not drinking it.
What are you doing, bathing in the stuff?
- [Seth] How did you guess?
- What?
Any doctor will tell you. Milk baths.
When a man gets to be my age, milk supples the flesh.
You ought to try it on that ornery hide of yours.
Can you help me, Napoleon?
So long, Amos.
So long, Seth.
Goodbye, Mr. Gutteridge.
Thanks again.
Bye, Napoleon.
You napping, Grandpa?
What, what?
Me? Napping? No, no!
Just squinching my eyes.
Looking for smoke signals.
Smoke signals? Where?
Over yonder hill there.
Wild Indians send out their messages about this time of day.
Didn't I ever tell you?
No. Golly.
I do believe there is one now.
No, iùs just a cloud.
No, Grandpa,
I think that is a smoke signal.
Yeah.
Come on, Maj. Giddyup.
Ah, you're slow as molasses.
Gosh.
Now get... come on.
Thaùs OK. It was a good ride.
Even if you can't gallop.
OK.
Come on, Maj.
You get in there.
Now, come on.
Get in there.
Your milk's waiting and everything, Maj.
Maj, get in there!
There. Finally.
Golly.
I'm gonna go see Grandpa, OK?
Hi, Grandpa.
Mornin', officer.
Me and Major have had our ride already.
You were sleeping so sound
I didn't want to wake you.
You getting up?
I thought maybe
I'd spend a day in bed.
I'm not feeling so well this morning.
Is your tummy bad again?
Something like that.
Hey, want me to fix you breakfast in bed, Captain?
I'd like that.
OK, I'll fix you something real special.
[Seth coughs]
Well, thank you.
My, my, this looks good.
- Whaùs this?
- Oh, thaùs an onion sandwich.
No.
Whaùs this?
Oh, thaùs chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla ice cream. All melted up.
Oh, my, my. That is tasty.
I think I'll just save that.
Set it over there, will you?
I'll just take my coffee.
Oh, thaùs the instant kind.
Since I don't know how to perc.
But I put in two extra spoons.
Good. Iùs good.
But I think I'll just save this too.
Set it there.
I better go clean up the kitchen.
- Napoleon.
- Yeah, Grandpa?
Come here a minute, will you?
Sit down. I want to talk to you.
- What are we gonna talk about?
- Us, Napoleon.
We are going to talk about us.
We've been a good crew, haven't we?
The two of us. Shipmates.
We've had some good times together.
We sure have, Captain.
The trouble is, your grandpa's getting older.
We both are.
I'm going to be 11 in August.
Trouble is, this old body of mine is just getting older.
Wrinkled old hands, tired old muscles, tickerjust keeps missing a tick now and then.
Then I take a deep breath, and I just keep coughing all the time.
But everybody coughs, Grandpa.
What are you going to do with an old machine thatjust keeps breaking down?
You fix it.
What about when you can't fix it no more?
Well, you gotta trade it in for a new one.
Thaùs just what I'm going to do.
I'm going to trade this old machine of mine in for a new one.
What do you mean, Grandpa?
Iùs nothing to be concerned about, or scared or frightened about.
Iùs just that my old body's dying.
I'm not surprised.
Iùs a wonder it didn't do it years before, the way I treated it.
I never knew anyone who died before.
Nobody ever really dies, Napoleon.
The thing thaùs real in you just keeps going on and on forever.
You know, in a way... we're like the seasons. Life is.
You're born in the spring, then you grow up during the hot, warm summer, then autumn's the time when you reach maturity.
You hit your peak.
Then... then, there's the winter.
It gives us all a chance to go quickly back to spring and start all over again.
But you still have to go away and leave me, don't you, Grandpa?
No, that doesn't follow at all.
You see, I always wanted to take my rest up there on the hill where we used to like to sit and watch the sunset.
'Course, I've made my peace with the Almighty.
I know he's not going to be too concerned about my not having an expensive funeral and all that.
Besides, your uncle.
He'll see to all those things.
You never said I had an uncle or anything like that before.
Well, you have.
He's your last living relative.
He's the one I wrote, and told him all about you.
Is he gonna come and stay with us?
I haven't heard from him yet, but he'll be here, and when I go away, he is the one thaùs going to take care of you.
Whaùs his name?
Charley Hammond.
I know a horse named Charley.
Do you now?
Gee, I hope your grandpa's feeling better.
I'm going in and see him right now.
We'll feed Major a little later.
Wait here, will you?
All right.
Grandpa, I'm home!
I'm sorry, Grandpa.
I didn't know you were asleep.
Grandpa?
Grandpa?
[Seth] Remember, son, iùs nothing to be frightened about.
Just means that old grandpa's set free to get around again.
Whaùs the matter, Napoleon?
Something wrong?
Did you ever know anyone that died before?
[Sam] No.
Did...
[Napoleon] My grandpa just did.
Oh, Napoleon.
Iùs...
Iùs nothing to be scared or worried about.
Just means that... my grandpa's free to do what he wants to now.
See, thaùs just his old body in there.
You know, my grandpa said that... nobody ever really dies because... the thing thaùs real inside of you goes on and on forever and ever.
I think thaùs very beautiful,
Napoleon, but... who's going to look after you now?
My uncle.
Where's he?
- In New York.
- When's he coming?
I don't know just yet.
He's supposed to write.
Whaùs it say?
"Unclaimed mail."
Do you know what that is?
I think it means that nobody was there to get the letter.
Napoleon... was that your only uncle?
Haven't you got any more relatives?
- No.
- You'll have to live at the orphanage.
Thaùs where they put people that don't have any relatives.
- I won't go.
- They'll make you.
No, they won't.
I won't tell anybody my grandpa's dead.
You can't keep that a secret.
Yes, I can. You better not tell anybody.
But they'll see the funeral.
There's not going to be any funeral.
I'm going to bury my grandpa up there on our hill.
Where we used to sit and watch the sunset.
Thaùs what he always wanted.
He told me that.
Well, who's going to do it?
I'll have to do it myself.
He's too big for you to bury.
Then I'll have to hire somebody.
Do you know anybody I can use?
You'll have to go see the employment office.
You better hurry.
They probably close at five o'clock.
How you doing, general?
I'm a captain.
If you're a captain, where's your hat?
I haven't got it yet.
I just became a captain.
Oh.
Next, please.
- Hi.
- Occupation?
I have a degree in political science, but...
We have this job in a lumber camp.
If you qualify, iùs steady employment.
I don't want it too steady.
I'm still going to school...
Sorry, thaùs all we have.
Don't you have just a little odd job?
I have to buy a book.
"Thompson's Theory of Modern Organization."
We only deal with people who are interested in regular employment.
Closed for now.
Right.
Well, thank you very much, ma'am.
Appreciate it.
- Hello again.
- I was wondering if we could talk.
Sure. What do you want to talk about?
Ecology? The political scene?
The stock market?
Hello, Napoleon.
[Napoleon] Hi, Gertrude.
Napoleon, huh?
Yeah. Whaùs your name?
Daniel Arlington Williams the Third.
But you just call me Danny, all right?
What are we gonna talk about?
Well, I wondered if you wanted to work for me.
It depends.
Think you can afford my services?
I don't know.
How much does that
"Thomas' Organization..."
Whatever it is cost?
Iùs a book. Costs about, oh, four dollars and fifty cents.
- I have that much.
- Did you come by that honestly?
Yeah, iùs mine.
Will you work for me?
OK. What do you want me to do?
Iùs a secret.
You gotta promise not to tell anybody.
I promise.
I cross my heart. I promise.
Well...
I want you to help me bury my grandpa.
Now, I'd like you to tell me again exactly what your grandfather said about your uncle, and...
[lion roars]
Whaùs that?
Oh, thaùs Major.
My lion.
Iùs time for his milk.
Your lion.
Then my grandpa said he didn't want anything like a fancy funeral.
He wanted to be buried up there on our hill.
Where we used to go and watch the sunset.
I guess a man can have his own private burying grounds if he wants to.
Thing is, we can't keep it a secret.
Just until my uncle gets here.
Or else they'll take Major away from me.
Yeah, I guess they would.
Well, we'll need some wood and tools.
- Danny?
- Yeah?
Be nice if we could be ready by sunset.
OK.
For everything there's a season.
And a time for every purpose.
A time to be born and a time to die.
And as the setting sun comes to rest on this beautiful day, so rests our friend peacefully in the arms of Mother Earth.
Now like the sun that has set so it can rise again, so rests our friend that he can rise in a new life.
We shouldn't feel sorrow for the setting sun.
Nor should we cry for our lost friend.
I think thaùs all.
Napoleon, you have anything you want to say?
Thanks, Danny.
Grandpa...
I love you.
- You know something?
- Hmm?
I'm having second thoughts this morning about the whole thing.
Whaùs the matter?
I can't go.
I mean, I can'tjust take off and leave you here alone.
I told you, I'll be all right until my uncle gets here.
Thaùs another thing.
This whole uncle business sounds iffy.
What happens if he doesn't get here?
You're sure there's no place you can reach him now?
Uh, uh.
He's on his way here.
Must be Sam for school.
Come on in, Sam.
- Hi, Napoleon. Hi, Danny.
- Hi, Sam.
- How you feeling this morning?
- Fine, thanks.
Good. Why don't you sit down and join us.
Napoleon, your uncle should be here by the end of the week, right?
OK, I'll stay here till then.
Oh, but I'll be all right on my own.
Why don't you come and stay at my house?
Wait a minute.
Can he do that?
Sure. There's just me and Gertrude.
My folks are away.
Thaùs the answer.
Now I can go back to the cabin without worrying.
I bet iùs neat up there in the mountains.
Beautiful.
Do you think Maj and me can come up and stay with you?
Of course you can. You too, Sammy.
We'll have a picnic. Bring Maj.
I got lots of milk for Maj.
Whaùs this for?
Show us where you live.
I live right... right there.
Thaùs 14 miles across the mountains.
Two valleys, three ridges, the roughest country you ever seen.
Thaùs definitely not the way.
Bet I could make it.
Forget it.
What you have to do is take the highway to Pinewood Junction.
A guy named Gypsey's got a service station there.
He lends me his shack.
I take care of his sheep and goats.
Ask Gypsey and he'll take you up the back road in his jeep.
- All right?
- OK.
Leùs not wait for social calls, know what I mean?
If anything goes wrong, find Gypsey and he'll get in touch with me.
OK, but nothing's going to go wrong.
Will you be coming back here soon?
I should be back in a couple of weeks.
When your uncle arrives, you tell him everything, OK?
All right.
Goodbye, Danny.
- See you soon. Bye.
- See ya.
- Will you, Napoleon?
- Will I what?
Come and stay with us.
No, I gotta stay here and take care of Maj, like right now.
[Gutteridge] I swear.
That grandfather of yours.
He's coming into his second childhood.
First milk baths, then stuffing himself with candy.
No wonder he's feeling poorly.
Tell him I'm coming to see him tonight.
You can't do that.
Why can't I do that?
I've been coming to see your grandpa regular since before you were born.
Well...
Because he's going to be out tonight.
Then, I'll see him tomorrow.
Maybe Mr. Gutteridge won't come tomorrow.
'Course he will.
He and my grandpa were best friends.
What if Danny won't let you stay with him?
He will... when I tell him that
I don't have an uncle and all.
I still think you ought to find Gypsey like Danny said.
Sure, and take Maj on the bus with me?
No, sir.
I'm gonna hike right over those mountains, just like Danny does.
Sure wish I could go with you.
See if you can do it. I can't.
I'll be right back.
If you're going to take
Doodle-Doo with you, you can't put him in the knapsack.
'Course not, you nut.
He's for you.
Oh, Napoleon, you shouldn't have.
I love him.
Would you like me to come and feed your other chickens?
No.
I'm gonna turn them loose.
I better get home.
Goodbye, Napoleon.
I really wouldn't mind going with you,
I mean... if you're afraid or anything.
Afraid! Why would I be afraid?
I mean, I've got Maj with me, haven't I?
Afraid.
I'm sorry.
Bye, Napoleon.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not. What about Gertrude?
- She'll be all right.
What do you mean
"she'll be all right?"
I left her a note. Said I was gonna stay with you and your grandpa.
Please, Napoleon.
I want to be with you.
You'll get scared.
No, I won't.
- Not with you and Maj to protect me.
- [Napoleon] Well...
OK. But you gotta promise never to cry.
I promise.
OK. Come on.
[Laughs]
Napoleon!
[Sam] Napoleon!
[Roars]
- [Sam] Napoleon, help!
- [Napoleon] What? Whaùs wrong?
Napoleon, look!
[Napoleon] Oh, no.
[Napoleon] Go get him, Maj!
Go get him!
Go get him, Maj!
[Sam] Come on! Get him, Maj!
[Napoleon] Come on, fly Doodle-Doo!
[Sam] Get out of here!
[Napoleon] Get out of here!
Go on! Get!
[Lion roars]
That a boy, Maj. You really showed him.
Here, Doodle. Here, boy. Come on.
Come on, boy.
He's OK. Just a little scared. There.
What are you shaking for?
I thought it was gonna get me,
Napoleon, I...
Don't worry. Nothing's gonna get you as long as Maj is around.
Here.
I'll give him some of my sandwich.
He loves it.
Why won't he come?
'Cause he's a cat.
- Cats don't like water.
- [Lion growls]
- [Sam] Good boy, Major!
- [Napoleon] Oh, Maj.
Oh!
- Aah!
- [Napoleon] Major.
Golly.
If he doesn't like water, what does he do when it rains?
[Napoleon] Gets wet.
Napoleon?
I don't like to complain, but my foot hurts.
- I'm tired.
- I know.
I was gonna stop for the night as soon as I could find a good place.
Hey, waitjust a second.
Hey!
You know something?
There's a barn just over the hill.
We can spend the night there.
We gotta be careful nobody sees us.
Come on.
Come on, Major.
There's nobody there.
Come on. Leùs go.
Iùs nice. Glad we found it.
Yeah, iùs OK for tonight.
Here you go, Doodle.
You'll love it here.
Iùs not here.
Whaùs not there?
Pinewood Junction.
I'm looking for the back road that leads from Gypsey's up to Danny's place.
Iùs just not here.
Sure you got the right map?
Of course I'm sure.
We can't see anything at night.
I'll look for it in the morning.
'Night. 'Night, Maj.
[Owl hoots]
[Wings flap]
Napoleon?
Are you scared?
No.
Don't you ever get scared?
[Napoleon] Whaùs there to be scared about?
- Lots of things.
- [Napoleon] Like what?
The dark.
The dark never hurt anybody.
Things in the dark.
Things like what?
Things thatjump out and scare you.
Thaùs all in your imagination.
Still scares me.
Thaùs kind of dumb. I mean... my grandpa said that people just make up things in their mind to be scared about.
Now go to sleep.
- How do you make it work?
- Easy. You just have to squeeze it.
Don't squeeze too hard, or she'll kick.
[Napoleon] Hey, it works!
I'm glad we decided to leave him there.
He seems happier.
Yeah, Doodle always liked to be with hens.
Come on.
[Sam] Iùs getting awful steep,
Napoleon.
[Napoleon] I told you.
Just don't look down and hang on.
- Napoleon, look at him.
- Aw, Maj.
Thaùs no place to lie down.
Now get up.
I feel like I'm going to slip.
What am I going to do?
Can't you kind of inch around him?
[Sam] I can't.
Climb right over top of him.
And put your foot right there.
He's just a little scared, but don't worry.
Give me your hand. Come on.
Now jump.
Gotcha.
OK, there's a level spot.
Now stay there. Iùs safe.
What are we going to do with him,
Napoleon?
We're gonna have to get him going again.
Oh, Major.
Major, go, Major.
Go!
Major! Go on, Major.
[Sam] Napoleon!
I'm OK.
I'm OK.
Napoleon.
Napoleon!
Don't get scared.
Just let me think.
I know.
Throw Major's rope down to me.
Maybe iùll reach.
There.
OK. Pull me up, Maj!
Pull me up!
Here, Major. Come on, Major.
[Sam] Good boy. Pull.
Thaùs it! Pull!
- [Sam] Come on, Major.
- Pull! Pull me up!
OK. Made it.
Thanks, Major.
Thanks a lot.
I didn't think anything would happen to her.
I thought she was with a boy and his grandfather.
Thaùs what she wrote in the note.
You read it.
Yes, ma'am.
Did she spend most of her time here?
With Napoleon, yes.
The last time you saw the boy he was walking down the street with a strange man. A "hippy type."
Thaùs right.
He's the one you should be checking on right now.
Excuse me, Chief.
Iùs a pity you don't like water.
Makes your feet feel real nice.
[Growls]
Sam! A bear!
Sam! Sam!
Get out of here!
Sam! Sam!
Iùs a bear, Maj!
Come on, Major! Iùs a bear!
Come on.
- [Sam] He won't budge!
- [Napoleon] Sam!
Get out!
Come on.
Major, get up. Iùs a bear!
Don'tjust stand there drinking your milk. Get up!
Move! Iùs a bear!
Major!
Go get him. Good.
Good, go get him!
Come on.
- Get him, Major!
- Go away, bear!
Major, go get him!
- Sock it to him!
- Come on!
Yeah!
Good boy.
Good boy, Major.
Major, you saved us!
He sure beat up that old bear.
He's so strong.
Thaùs why they call him
"king of beasts."
Napoleon, wait.
Just try to imagine something nice in your mind.
Iùll stop you thinking about being tired.
All I can think about is sitting down.
I bet we'll be able to see Danny's cabin from the top of this hill.
Chocolate cake with... strawberry ice cream... and marshmallows, and whipped cream, and cherries...
Cake. Apple pie.
Chocolate syrup.
There's nothin'.
[Cries]
- You promised you wouldn't do that.
- I know, but...
My feet hurt, and...
I wish my mom and dad were here.
Do you think we're gonna die?
Die? Of course not.
I know exactly where we are.
Almost.
See those mountains over there?
Those are these here.
We ought to be right about here.
But... they have a lake right here.
I don't see a lake around here.
Do you?
Napoleon, we're lost.
What are we gonna do?
Maybe we are a little lost right now.
But you know... we could stay here for weeks and weeks and live off the land.
- Just like the Indians.
- Could we do that?
Sure.
You're so good at everything.
I really admire you.
I'm sorry I was crying.
Thaùs OK.
Girls can't help it all the time.
You just stay here and rest.
I'm gonna go on a hunting trip.
Hey, you can't leave me here alone.
Major's with you.
- You'll be right back, won't you?
- Sure.
I'll bring back some food too.
Got him!
Shoot.
Huh?
Just me.
Did you get anything?
- Yeah.
- Whaùd you get?
Ewww.
- What is it?
- Snails.
I found them under a rock next to the river.
- You eat 'em?
- Sure. People eat them all the time.
They're really special.
They look horrible.
- Let me see you eat one.
- No, I've already had mine.
I'm not hungry anymore.
I woulÔve rather have had fish.
Well, I caught one.
But I decided to let it go.
But these are better for you anyway.
No, thaùs OK. I...
I guess I'm not very hungry anymore, either.
- Did you see anything?
- No.
I'm gonna go on a scouting trip right now.
- I'm gonna find out where we are.
- Napoleon...
Don't worry. Major's here with you.
I'm just going to the next ridge.
I bet thaùs where Danny is.
- OK?
- OK.
Good.
Major! Now you sit down!
Do you hear me?
Where are you going?
Come back here.
Napoleon!
Major!
Whaùs gotten into you anyway?
You want to get us more lost?
Napoleon!
Napoleon!
- [Napoleon] Danny!
- [Sam] Danny!
Danny! Iùs me, Napoleon!
Hey! Hey, Napoleon! Hey!
[Napoleon] We're coming to visit you.
Danny!
[Sam] Danny, we found you!
Danny, I'm so glad we found you.
You crazy kids.
How'd you get here?
Over the mountains.
Over the mount?
Do you know how lucky you are?
I could have been 100 miles from here.
We were attacked by a bear, and a mountain lion, we got lost...
Wait a minute. What happened?
What about your uncle?
And your parents?
Danny... could we have something to eat?
And some milk for Maj?
Sure. OK. But I want to hear the whole story, all right?
You should have told me the truth about your uncle.
You mean you have no idea where he is now?
- Why can't I come up and live with you?
- Because iùs not that simple.
For one thing, Samantha's here.
Gertrude's probably got in touch with your family by now.
I only wanted to help Napoleon.
I was gonna go home after that.
But in the meantime, they're worried sick.
Iùs all right to do your own thing, but when somebody gets hurt, thaùs something else.
Well, I'm not gonna live in town anymore.
If you don't want me, me and Major will go live up with the Indians like my grandpa did.
Napoleon, iùs not a game.
I like you here.
Iùs just not possible.
But I don't want to go back to any dumb old orphanage.
Orphanage?
Yeah. He's scared of orphanages.
"Orphanage" is like, a dirty word you read in story books.
They're not like that.
Look, there's a lot of kids like you, right, and thaùs too bad, but there's also good, kind people who gather you together and make a family in a nice home.
A place where everybody has friends, and you play games, and you get an education.
School?
Don't knock it.
With no education you're nothin'.
You get an education, you can do anything you want.
The thing you should want to do most now is be useful.
You know what I mean by being useful?
I think so.
Danny, are you useful?
[Laughs]
Well, um...
No, I wouldn't say I'm useful.
Not right now, but, um...
I do other things around here besides tend goats.
I think, and... study, and...
I'll get my master's degree soon.
- Whaùs that?
- Never mind.
The point is, if I can still go to school so can Napoleon.
Later on you can be with the Indians, sea captain, cowboy, anything you want.
But what about Maj?
Major can stay with me, and you can visit him when you want.
All right?
Well, I don't know, Danny.
Napoleon.
Can I think about it?
Yeah, sure.
You think about it.
Danny, what about me?
You?
Right after supper I'll head into town and catch a nap on the way.
In the morning, I'll talk to Gertrude, and we'll get the whole thing straightened out.
Are we going with you?
[Danny] No, sir.
No way. I think once across the mountains is enough.
- I got a babysitter for you.
- [Napoleon and Sam] A babysitter?
[Danny] Yeah. His name's Mark.
Came out of nowhere.
Just like you.
[Napoleon] Where is he?
[Danny] I don't know. In the woods.
He spends a lot of time there.
- I think you'll like him.
- [Roars]
[Danny] He's kind of quiet.
There's...
Mark, you look like you just saw a lion.
Don't worry. He's tame as a pussycat.
Belongs to the kids.
He's really tame.
His name's Major.
Come here, Major!
I'll introduce you to him.
Here, Major!
Hi, Mark.
[Lion roars]
- Yes. What...
- Good morning. My name is Danny...
[Danny] Hey!
Lady, if you're Gertrude,
I have to talk to you.
Just a minute.
I'm alone in the house.
I have to put on a robe.
- You stay right there.
- OK.
Hello, police?
Lady? Iùs important.
Iùs about Samantha.
Gertrude, she's all right.
Can you hear me?
She's OK. I came by to tell you that.
Hello?
All right, mister. Take it easy.
- Whaùs going on?
- Against the door.
- What?
- You're under arrest.
Whaùd I do?
You have a right to remain silent.
If you give up this right, anything you say can and will be used against you.
You got the wrong guy.
You have a right to speak to an attorney during questioning.
- Now, wait a minute.
- Leùs go.
Thaùs him. He's the one, all right.
What did you do with them?
Where are those poor children?
I've been trying to tell you they're OK.
They're up in my cabin.
If you let me explain and listen to me.
The chief will do the listening and talking. Don't cause any trouble.
[Lva] Gertrude!
Is he the one?
He certainly is.
If he's harmed one hair on her head, I'll...
- Iva, will you drive me to the station?
- Indeed I will. Let me get the car.
Give me five minutes.
- That all you got?
- Thaùs all.
The chief will be here in a few minutes.
- Right. Pete, get him printed.
- Come on, this way.
See if there's a make on him.
Right hand first.
Are the kids all right?
Where'd they catch him?
[Lva] Come on, Gertrude, you step right up and tell them about it.
Where are they?
[Policeman] Quiet down, everybody.
I want to know where Samantha is!
Lady. Gertrude...
I keep telling everybody but no one's listening.
The kids are at my cabin.
They're fine.
- I don't know what this is all about.
- Two kids have disappeared, an old man lies buried in his backyard, and you were there.
- Right.
- You got a lot of questions to answer.
Come on, people.
Let the chief handle it.
Leùs move it.
Look, I'm not going anywhere until I know Samantha's safe!
All right, you.
Sit down over here.
You guys are really beautiful.
All you have to do is send somebody to the cabin. This would all be over.
If iùs cool, there's no hurry.
- Leùs wait till the chief gets here.
- We'll do everything by the book.
[Danny] Wait a minute.
- Hey, fella.
- Look at this.
Sit down.
This psycho is with the kids.
He's dangerous. Says it right here.
I'm telling the truth.
We gotta get up there.
Let go of me and listen!
Take it easy!
Wait till the chief gets back.
Iùll be all right.
- Out of the way!
- Watch it!
There he goes.
Go back inside.
Take your car and cover the other side.
Hey, buddy.
[Woman screams]
[Man] Look out!
[Woman] Get out!
[Horn beeps]
Car two, repeat. I don't read you.
[Car 2] He's on a cycle.
Headed north on 27.
Should we set up a roadblock? Over.
Check and advise.
See what you can find out about him.
Is that Pete?
Whatever you do, don't take your eyes off him.
We'll set up a roadblock at Dawson's Ridge.
Put Adams and Suskind on it too.
This could turn out to be a big deal.
If we lose him, he could take off in the brush.
- You want me to call the state patrol?
- Yeah.
And, uh, Chief Thomas at Carsonville.
Leùs get everybody on it.
Notify the airport.
Get a copter ready for me in 10 minutes.
H-C-G, 4-4-0. This is 22.
Request copter. Stand by.
[Sirens]
Slow down!
[Worker] Hey!
[Worker] Hey, fella!
What do you think this is?
A racetrack?
Nut!
[Policeman] Get that dozer out of the way.
Whaùs going on?
[Siren]
[Siren]
There he goes.
Look out.
[Policeman] Are you OK?
[Man] I don't know. Why don't you guys learn how to drive that thing?
Ajeep. Leùs take it.
[Man] Where are you going with my jeep?
Don't worry about it.
[Logger] Easy. Take it away.
Hey, you!
Come back here!
Go ahead.
Look out.
[Horn blasts]
Up there.
OK. We've gotcha. Go ahead.
- Chief, Mike.
- Yeah.
About the escaped psycho, he's a lulu.
- Just give it to me straight.
- Yes, sir.
He escaped ten days ago.
He used to live in Carsonville, so he could be in our area.
- Over and out.
- How do you like that?
- The guy was telling the truth.
- He sure was.
Hey, look!
He didn't want us to nail him till he got us up here.
Take her down quick.
Close to the cabin.
[Policeman] Take it easy.
[Sam] Hi, Danny.
Hi. Whaùs all the noise about?
Sounds like helicopters or something.
[Napoleon] Where did Mark go?
- You kids all right?
- [Napoleon] Sure.
- Hey, it was a helicopter, wasn't it?
- Yeah.
- Whaùs been going on here?
- Just a game.
Then all the noise and Mark ran out like he was scared or something.
We were his prisoners and he was the wicked giant.
Wait a minute. Hold on.
- Nothing's wrong, is it?
- Everything will be all right.
Sam, look, iùs the police.
What are they doing with Mark?
Are they taking him to jail?
No, just to a hospital.
- A hospital?
- [Danny] Yes.
Mark's been sick.
The hospital thinks iùs better if he came back with them.
Gosh.
He sure didn't look sick to me.
You know, he was the best giant
I ever played with.
Goodbye, Mark.
You mean, we get to ride back in a helicopter?
Thaùs what I said. But the lion will have to stay here with you.
For this trip, anyway.
No more, thank you.
We got through to Samantha's parents.
They'll be at the airport.
They're home! Napoleon!
Next time you're in town, stop by my office. I'll serve the coffee.
- Danny, Napoleon's run away again!
- What?
See? There he goes.
[Danny] Let me see.
Maybe I can handle it.
OK.
Napoleon!
Where you going?
I thought we had a deal.
No. I just said
I'd think it over, Danny.
I decided...
I better go live with the Indians.
On account of Maj and all.
There aren't any Indians around here.
- Not anymore.
- Yes, there are. I'll show you.
Just over this mountain.
[Danny] Boy, iùs a big world, isn't it?
Nobody can make it alone.
We all need people to help us.
Mark needs people to help him, and they will.
You'll need people to help you.
Trust them, Napoleon.
Trust me.
Danny?
Well... about the Indians... well...
I meant over the next mountain.
Come on.
Hurry up, Maj.
When's your plane, darling?
Wish you weren't going.
The board is expecting me tomorrow.
I know. I wish you didn't have to go.
I gotta see the old bastard.
When I get back, we'll take a trip.
-Isn't he a beauty?
-You're a beauty.
No, I'm not going to ride.
You got it.
You're under arrest for Enrique Cordoza's murder.
Ann!
Enrique--
What do you mean, Enrique?
Jay!
What are you talking about?
-Mr. Wagner.
-Mr. Cable.
The frame-up is complete.
Your grandson was arrested in
Santiago, extradited to Mexico City.
He'll be convicted within the month.
-Sentence?
-Between 25 and 30 years.
You resent my interference in this matter.
We have a procedure for those on the wrong side.
There's them and us.
The winning side and the losing side.
The line has not yet been drawn.
He supports those against us.
He threatened CIA interests and my stockholders?
-Who did you have murdered?
-No one of importance.
I don't want my grandson to suffer the same fate.
-Is that clear, Mr. Cable?
-Yes.
Your grandson will try to escape.
It's a pity, at my age...
...falling victim to a cliché.
I don't know what you mean.
Because of a distant link between his chromosomes and mine...
...my grandson stays alive.
I say it's a mistake.
Perhaps.
Twenty-five to 30 years.
There's no possible way the accused could have left Santiago...
...flown to Mexico City and returned at the time we documented.
Nonetheless, it is...
...the decision of this court...
...that you...
...Jay Louis Wagner...
...are guilty as charged.
You shall serve a term...
... of 28 years
in the federal penitentiary.
You'll be allowed the same
privileges as all prisoners.
Including conjugal visits
every two weeks.
This judgement is final.
Goddamn sons of bitches!
Wait, wait. Hey, wait.
What did they do to you?
Huh?
They put their filthy hands all over me.
Who's supposed to boost whose morale up?
Jay, what are they doing to you?
Well, it's not exactly the Ritz.
But...
Well, it is pretty bad.
It really is. Where's the money?
In the back of the radio.
-I'll talk to your grandfather.
-No, absolutely not.
-I don't know what to do.
-I won't kiss his ass.
This is all we need.
They'll sell anything.
Including freedom.
I really think you must do it legally.
Sanchez has filed an appeal.
I can't wait that long.
Last week there was a guy in for pushing drugs.
He walked and they're not looking for him...
...because he paid his way off.
I still think we should--
Absolutely not! No!
Look at this place.
Look what they're doing to me.
Jay.
I want you.
The day we're reduced to making love in here is...
That's the day I give up.
Don't worry, darling. I have a plan.
And this money will do it.
What's going on? Let me out!
Wait, man. Just wait.
-What's happening? Let me out!
-All right, I will.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
Let me out of here!
When I am ready, Mr. Wagner.
Let me out of here!
Let me out!
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!
We can't let him stay in that horrible place.
-Of course not.
-We can't. I can't.
Ann...
...it isn't just a matter of fire and earth...
...and air and water that makes up this world.
It's passion and strength and cunning...
...and money.
I've got money.
As much as you'll need.
Jay thinks he won't get out of that place legally.
He wants to escape.
Has he got a plan?
Not yet.
Well...
Whatever it costs, you can count on me.
Hawk! Let's get the hell out of here!
-Come on!
-I can't breathe, Nick!
-Where's the bucket?
-Get the hell out!
Hey! Get back!
There's gasoline in there. The thing--
It's okay. It's okay.
You can't burn smoked fish.
But look. I wouldn't have believed it.
-You know about smoked fish?
-Smoked fish?
-You from the health department?
-Do I look like it?
I'm looking for Nick Colton.
They made me burn my fish.
There's two tons in there.
Maybe they made you because your fish is spoiled?
No, they're opposed to fish on principle.
I've got to find Nick Colton.
Do you know him?
Who wants to know?
He was recommended by a man in Fort Worth. Mr. Charles Mazdick.
That's Charming Charlie. Hey, Hawk!
She knows Charming Charlie.
He said, ask Nick Colton.
He'll do anything for money.
If old Charlie said so, you can plug in, baby, because I'm Nick.
-You?
-Hawk, keep shoveling.
I'll be back to help.
So you want me to fly to Mexico...
...pick up this dude, and bring him back.
Exactly.
I should tell you
Pan Am does it five times a day...
...with meals! Sit down.
Not on that road, they don't.
-Got a name? Passport? This guy?
-None that needs to concern you.
A poor slob needs a lift.
Be Kind to Hitchhikers week?
Can you do it?
I can land a jumbo jet on a quarter.
I'm willing to offer $1000.
I'll tell you, 1000 has never been a figure to palpitate me.
Don't judge us on looks.
We're growing.
Or the fish out there. I have checks
I haven't cashed. Look here.
Here's one for $500. I haven't had time to take it to the bank.
That job was easier than yours.
All right. What's your price?
Like I said, we're pretty busy.
How much?
-Twelve hundred.
-Agreed.
-And 39 dollars.
-Good enough.
And 52 cents.
Whoa. Cash. Cash.
-I'll pay you after we get back.
-Before we take off.
If you insist.
We've got a deal.
Not quite.
The fee included an aeroplane.
We got one of those.
I didn't see it.
Well, it's out there.
I'd still like to see it.
Follow me.
-That?
-Yeah. It flies like a bird.
-That won't be ready in time.
-I can nail it together in 30 minutes.
It has to be tomorrow.
It'll be ready. Don't worry.
You just trust old Nick.
Run along. Don't worry.
It's under control.
I certainly hope so.
Remember, you just trust me.
That's the last time
I shovel your mess.
You did a good job.
Why do I always end up shovelling?
While you shovelled,
I made US $500.
-Five?
-She's paying me to fly to Mexico.
We lost more on the fish.
I know that. Hell, I'm ready to pay my loss right now.
There's a check for $500 made out by Chili Shuster himself.
Shit! Chili's doing 20 in Huntsville for bad checks.
What are you gonna do, condemn a man because he was caught? Damn it.
According to this map, we should be almost there.
-Any last-minute things to say?
-Like what?
-This guy we're gonna pick up?
-You've been well paid, Mr. Colton.
What the hell?
-That's him! Wait!
-Where?
-You didn't pay me for this!
-Wait!
-Stop, you bastard!
-Let go! Let go!
For trying to escape.
For underestimating me.
You need companionship.
You will learn.
Yeah, what did I tell you?
Right on time.
You know what you can do.
What the hell happened?
Coward!
There were guys shooting at us.
-We could have done it!
-You almost got us killed.
-You were paid to get my husband!
-Not to get shot!
-Your husband?
-Yes.
Yes. And you were paid.
All I knew was it was a pickup.
I wasn't supposed to get shot at.
I didn't know it was your husband.
Got a slug in the oil line.
The oil line?
We'll find someone else.
You listen to that shyster. Maybe you'll manage to get somebody killed.
Want my advice? Talk to a pro.
Like you?
Yeah, like me!
You look at me and see a bum in a funny hat.
But I am a pro.
I make my living on this border.
I know the ins and outs.
And you see this hat?
It's to strain the lousy gasoline you sell there.
I'm not about to rip her off...
-...and blow my reputation.
-We don't know you.
To hell with you!
-It's leaking like a sieve.
-I know.
Ann! Ann!
I don't care what it costs.
I want Jay out of there.
Mr. Colton, I want you to try again.
This time you tell me everything.
Why won't they let him out?
He's in prison.
Shit.
In that case, it'll cost you $2000.
Preposterous!
That's 2000 to get him.
2000 on delivery.
No!
-Can you guarantee delivery?
-I don't know what he did.
But there are ways.
He's innocent.
What's the difference?
It's just as tough and costs the same.
Give him 2000.
-We should discuss this.
-Give it to him.
Privately.
Nobody else has done anything.
He will try.
Maybe he can. Give it to him.
-How would you do it?
-That's none of your business.
Give him the money.
So the hat is used for things...
...other than straining our poor Mexican gasoline.
Two thousand.
Hawk!
-They're paying us $2000?
-Right. She already gave me 1000.
1000 more when they're out.
We have to pay expenses, maybe give a cut to Myrna.
-Okay to me.
-Spence. How are you doing?
-Giving out any traffic tickets?
-What do you want?
Just here to say hello and maybe borrow your wife.
-You son of a bitch!
-Someone mention my name?
There she is.
Look at that. There's my--
His baby.
We got us a very big contract.
-All we need is the feminine touch.
-Beat it!
I want to hear it.
He's better than television.
He ain't to me.
Spencer, if you're going to make sheriff, you've got to be friendly.
Right.
Myrna and me, we go way back.
Yeah, way back.
Like way back behind a haystack.
Every cop should have a sense of humour.
-What's this "touch of femininity"?
-I haven't worked it out yet.
But we need someone to wear a wig.
When I want to give money away,
I think of my friends.
-I'm here to give Myrna $100.
-She ain't interested.
-Suit yourself.
It doesn't amount to more than a little walk.
-And it's hard for Myrna to make $200.
-Yeah.
You said $100.
That's $100 down and $100 when it's over.
Yeah, we got the money too.
Show them, Nick.
-Where do I take this little walk?
-It's not far from here. In Mexico.
-Mexico?
-Don't worry. Nick will fly her.
Bullshit! You ain't taking my baby to Mexico.
I don't trust you with her.
Hold it. I want to hear this.
There's a young guy down there.
He's the clean-cut type.
He's locked up.
All Myrna has to do is wear this wig.
Make herself up so she doesn't look like the clean...
...young wife of the future sheriff of our county.
-She'll look like a Mexican whore.
-Whore.
-Whore! You son of a bitch!
-All right, forget it.
I thought you could use an extra $300.
-Three hundred?
-For you, 350.
Spence, maybe--
Like my husband says,
I'm not interested.
Shit. That leaves me in a hole.
Well, hell.
It's not that tough.
With the right makeup, anybody can look like a whore.
Yeah.
I think you're right, Myrna.
Exactly what I'm thinking.
You gotta be kidding.
Nick...
Oh, come on, Nick.
No, sirree-bob-dixie.
I'm not going to dress up in all that garbage there. No, sir.
-You got the makeup?
-Yeah.
What cell is he in?
-Number 15.
-That's right.
Tell him to use plenty of lipstick and eye makeup.
Coming out, he's got to mix with those whores. I'll be here.
I give him this wig and dress and come back here?
That's right. But make sure you take your makeup off.
-Get going.
-I wish this was you.
Hawk, you might even get to like it.
Hawk, don't forget to swing it.
Wagner? You Jay Wagner?
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?
Let him go!
Goddamn it, let him go!
Let him go!
This is the way I figure it.
We dig a tunnel just about here.
Then, we dig another tunnel there.
If they locate one, they won't think to look for another.
-He'd be free.
-I don't know.
It will be expensive, Ann.
But it's better than wasting money with those guys.
Mr. Henderson, this is a lot of trouble.
My husband might be safe right now.
Ann, I keep on telling you.
We'll never see Colton again.
-You double-crossing bastards.
-Where's Jay?
Shut up! I'm mad enough to bust you.
I got questions and I expect answers.
You! What do you gain...
-...if your husband stays in prison?
-You're out of line, Mr. Colton.
-You too, out.
-Now stop it!
-We're not leaving you with him.
-It's all right.
All right. We'll be outside the door.
The answer to your question is nothing. I stand to gain nothing.
Tell me what happened down there.
They beat up my best friend and my partner.
They were waiting for us.
Somebody told them. They knew.
-They always know.
-Right, I think you told them!
I think you got drunk and shot your mouth off.
I never get that drunk!
And what the hell is this?
That is a scale plan of the prison.
You can forget it because I'm going back. I'm getting him out.
No, Mr. Colton.
You've had your chance and you failed.
Do it your way!
Go with their plan.
Whatever it is. What is it?
Dig a tunnel?
Maybe two, in case the first is found out.
You know what?
They'll dig and they'll hit rock, and they'll hit water.
They'll dig for two years, and your husband--
He'll be sitting there and rotting.
Maybe that's what you want.
No!
No, I want him out.
But I don't know what to do.
You keep coming to me with your sure-fire schemes.
And I keep hoping and believing in you.
I'm paying and nothing seems to work.
Hell.
Come on, you don't have to cry like that.
I don't like to see anybody crying.
Look.
You cut your hair.
Look at that.
It looks good.
I'll tell you what.
I'll take another whack at it.
-How much were they asking you for?
One hundred thousand dollars!
I'm going to do it for nothing.
Nothing!
That's nothing up-front.
I'll only ask for half as much on delivery. Fifty thousand dollars.
-You have another idea?
-Yeah.
What is it?
I don't know.
I ain't thought about it yet.
Forget about the preliminaries.
I know what makes it go up and down.
Okay. How do you intend to pay for your lessons?
G.I. Bill.
I have a better idea.
I'll pay you for the lessons now.
This is made out for too much.
Just give me the balance.
We can't accept checks.
-You can't?
-No.
We'll settle up later.
You can trust me.
I'm uneasy about your grandson. It's been a while since his escape attempt.
Relax, Mr. Cable.
Unlike yourself, some men do eventually give up.
No, something is going on.
If there is, his wife will tell me.
I can't count on that.
He gets to the States, we can't touch him. You know my instructions.
All too well, Mr. Cable.
All too well.
Maybe next time you'll tell me your plan.
I don't have any more money on me.
You don't have to pay.
All I want from you is to take me with you.
You promise?
-Give me that bottle.
-Good.
I got a hell of a good idea.
Let's get drunk.
Goddamn stupid. You dressed that big ape up to look like a whore!
-Who did you think you would fool?
-I'm so sorry, Jay.
This Colton thinks it's a joke.
It wasn't a joke.
And that "big ape" nearly lost his life trying to get you out.
Well, they were paid, weren't they?
Anyway, it was Colton's idea.
How come I never get to meet him?
Jay...
I can't bring him here so that everyone knows he's working for us.
Not anymore, he's not.
You pay him off.
That's the end of it.
What happened?
I just cut it.
-Don't you like it?
-It's different.
You used to always check with me before.
I see.
What do you see?
Jay...
Jay, you think I'm sleeping with someone. But I'm not.
Well, I notice things.
What things?
Every time you come to visit, you're a little...
...colder. A little bit more matter-of-fact.
Matter-of-fact?
Are you still as horny as you used to be?
This guy Colton.
How is he?
-Does he give you a good hump?
-Oh, Jay!
-You're still my wife. Get these off.
-No.
Conjugal privileges.
You can be his whore...
-...or my whore.
-No, Jay.
-You're my whore.
-Jay, no.
Shit!
Shit! Damn it!
-Take it, take it!
-You got to understand this machine.
-Understand it? I'll break its neck.
-I'm afraid of that.
Wait a minute.
Some people can't chew gum and tap at the same time.
I can.
It's only your third lesson.
Give it time.
Let's lay it on the line.
With two more weeks of lessons, would I be as good as you?
No. You'll never be that good.
That's all I wanted to know.
Goddamn it, the way you come here to borrow my wife.
-She ain't a lawn mower.
-You're right, Spence.
I admit I was out of line before.
I don't know how I could ask your lady to pose as a whore.
But I swear, this time it's nothing.
-What do you want?
-Like he says--
-Let him tell it.
-It's just down there and back.
You get to go to the lake.
I get no day off.
Now this time she's right.
Fair is fair.
Spence, you're going to make a thousand dollars.
-A thousand dollars for doing nothing.
-Practically nothing.
-No.
-Spencer, I got a say in this too.
You're the wife of an officer.
And you don't do nothing illegal.
Who says illegal?
If it wasn't, you'd say what she has to do.
-She has to get out of a car and yell.
-Yell what?
She has to yell that she's been raped.
You get out of here.
Rape! Rape!
Come on, Spencer.
A thousand bucks just for that.
Just think.
You can buy fishing gear...
...make a payment on a new car...
...maybe even a color TV.
What guarantee do we have that we'll ever see the money?
That.
A check for five hundred dollars.
-Don't cash it until we get back.
-Why not?
It has sentimental value.
Look at the date. It's two months old.
It's the last check my best friend ever wrote.
I'd like to keep it as long as I can.
I will let you hold it, just to show my good faith.
Okay.
But if you lay one hand on my Myrna...
...I'll tear your head off and shit in it.
Take it from me, nothing ever happens in this world until you're self-employed.
I can't believe his luck.
Getting a chance like this.
-You want him to fly that ore?
-What ore?
Sure. He can borrow one of the choppers. He's got 10,000 hours.
-Thirty-six hundred and fifty.
-Thirty-six hundred and fifty.
I'll lay it on the line for you.
There's a lot of money here.
A lot of money involved.
I'm offering you five percent.
What do you say?
I say, hot damn!
I told you to come alone.
It was my fault, Mr. Colton.
I insisted.
Did you have to do that?
I don't trust him.
Did you bring them?
Yes.
The one on top is the most recent.
He might be hard to recognize.
He's changed so much.
He's changed?
That's great.
Do this.
Tell him I want him in that courtyard at 3:00 in the afternoon.
-One week from today.
-But he's a very sick man.
He's in the hospital.
I don't know if he can do it.
He's got to be there.
Tell him to get better.
Three o'clock.
Not five minutes before, not five minutes after.
We'll wait for 10 seconds.
I leave with or without him.
To tell you the truth...
...a part of me hopes it's without him.
How will you do it?
If I tell you and they're waiting for us...
...what will I think?
You don't trust me.
We will fly him out by helicopter.
-But that's so dangerous.
-You're damn right it's dangerous.
Nick, I...
Don't worry.
All yours.
I don't know.
It doesn't look right.
-There's something wrong.
-You said blue.
By this picture, the attorney generaI's is royal blue.
-Hell, blue is blue.
-Hey!
Holy shit!
What are you doing?
Who told you you could do that?
Do what?
Do what? That!
What will the boss say?
Probably thanks. Hell, we won't even charge him for the paint.
Looks better, huh?
I'll tell you something, there better be a big score in this.
You wait, buddy.
You wait!
I need a moment with him alone.
Sosa's my good friend.
I know he is.
He's not going away.
Please.
I will be close by, amigo.
Jay.
Jay, listen to me.
Friday afternoon at 3:00,
Colton will get you out. Understand?
-That's right.
Which day?
-Jay, which day?
-Friday.
Right. In the courtyard.
You'll only have 10 seconds.
You must be there at 3:00.
And there's--
There's one other thing,
Colton's never seen you.
-You must--
-You have to leave.
-I need a few more minutes.
-Okay, but come.
I have a right to speak with my husband.
By tomorrow night you'll be a real wife.
Yes, you will.
You be here.
See you tomorrow.
Good afternoon.
-Here you are.
-Hi.
What is the purpose of your visit into Mexico?
Not in front of the lady, huh?
We're just tourists here for the weekend.
-Welcome to Mexico.
-Oh, yeah. Si, si.
-Just like old times, Myrna?
-Yeah, like old times, baby.
Spencer has good qualities.
I'm not knocking him.
But you men--
Who are you calling?
Just trying to get a weather fix.
You're married to a cop, and you can't even jaywalk.
Could you undo me?
You can't believe the guilt
I feel now.
-Goddamn!
-What? What's the matter?
Chance of high winds tomorrow.
I know. And it might even get stormy tonight.
That's all I need, high winds.
-Nick?
-What?
I've been worried about tomorrow.
I have to be convincing, and I've never been raped.
-We should all be so lucky.
-What's that joke?
A guy says, "So help me,
I'll rape you."
The girl says, "So rape me,
I'll help you."
So?
So, rape me. I'll help you.
Oh, Myrna.
Is that all you got on your mind?
You never had anything else on your mind but that, since kindergarten.
I got something else now.
I know the chopper will lift off.
But landing it--
-Tell her, not me.
-Who?
-I see the way you look at her.
-You're crazy.
Never thought you'd stick your neck out for a girl.
-I'm in this for the money.
-You're doing it for her.
So what? It's my neck!
Remember that when you fail tomorrow...
...and spend the next five years in some beaner jail.
You sure know how to make a guy feel good.
How do you think I feel?
You brought me here. I thought we were going to have some fun.
Now if we did it, you'd think of her and I'd think of Spencer.
Spencer and her would make a lousy couple.
Go on, get out of here.
Save your strength for tomorrow.
Rape. I should be so lucky.
Come on, pile in.
-Have you levelled with him yet?
-I will now.
-If he says no?
-How could he say no?
Who could say no to Nick?
-Harvey.
-Hi, Nick.
-What did you do with the beer?
-It's down here.
These things, they either fly or they don't.
There's been a little change of plan.
All right.
Instead of lifting ore off a mountain, we'll lift a guy out of jail.
You son of a bitch.
Just hear me out.
This guy shouldn't be there.
He was framed.
Look at it as a mission of mercy.
You can do it with your eyes shut.
-What happens if we get caught?
-If it was dangerous, would I go?
You're not listening.
I won't do it.
I never figured you'd turn chicken.
Chicken? Chicken doesn't have anything to do with this.
I'm something you never figured with all your angles. I'm in love.
You're what?
I'm getting married in three weeks.
I'll help you. I'll give you a part of my share, Hawk will give you...
-...a part of his.
-What are you saying?
-It's a wedding present.
-No, I said I'm in love.
I'm getting married. Nothing...
...will keep me away from that ceremony.
Not you. Not some guy in prison.
Or all the goddamn money in the world. Nothing!
-He means it.
-We'll cancel everything.
-No, I'll do it.
-You can't fly that.
I took lessons.
-You're good, but not in a chopper.
-Goddamn it, Hawk, shut up!
Those pepper-bellies have been sticking it to us since we started.
It's my turn now. This is my show.
I do it on my own.
So, a miraculous recovery.
I just wanted to get some fresh air.
Either you stay in bed, or I'll send you to solitary.
For your health.
Ready.
Hawk and Myrna ought to be getting there about now.
Take it easy. Don't over-control.
Good luck.
Shit!
Are you sure you know nothing?
Nothing.
He talks. I don't understand.
-And when his wife visits him?
-They whisper. I could not hear.
Somebody heard Wagner said,
"Friday afternoon."
Friday afternoon? Today?
Yes?
How long do I have to sit here?
Until Friday's over.
One thousand and one.
One thousand and two.

Bring your papers. Come with me.
A little off your usual route, aren't you?

-What's the purpose of the flight?
-Pleasure, Smitty. Pleasure.
Pleasure? In Matamoros?
Take it where you can get it.
Just a minute.
Call from Mexico, Harry.
-Want it?
-You handle it.
Good evening.
-Are you the customs man?
-No. Immigration.
Do you have Mr. Jay Wagner here?
Mister Wagner?
Come with me, sir.
-What do you want with him?
-Just routine.
Easy does it.
There we are.
Maybe you'd better wait.
It's government business, sir.
A plane from Mexico.
-Would you speak a little louder?
-Wait here.
Smitty, one of the passengers is sick.
He's really sick.
-What about a sick man?
-What?
-You mentioned a sick man.
-There's a guy on the plane.
Bring him in. We'll look at him.
I'll keep these.
-I think I know you.
-Really?
I don't think so.
No, I remember.
-Get in the car, please.
-I remember.
Some immigration guy came for Wagner.
-Where?
-Over there.
Jay Wagner!
-I already got one of those.
-I know. But this is a good one.
Thank you for my husband.
Nice to have met you, Colton.
-Do we celebrate?

Fifty...
Fifty thousand, thirty-eight dollars, and fifty-three cents.
I'll buy you a beer.

SIKALI HORSE, FORWARD!
Splendid horsemanship. Who are they?
Sikali Horse, my lord. Christians all. I know each man by name.
Do they come well recommended? They rode for me at Bushman's Pass.
Oh, indeed.
Crealock, see that Col Durnford has an officer for his hard riders - the subaltern from the 24th.
It might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Yes. I see you issued each of them with a Martini-Henry carbine.
Our quota for natives - one rifle to ten men and five rounds per rifle. Will they make good use of them?
They're as good marksmen as horsemen.No doubting their horsemanship, Col Durnford.
Crealock.
We'll think how to make best use of Col Durnford's African knowledge.
Col Durnford. William Vereker.Yes? I hear you're seeking officers.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot.
Private Williams!
You've stopped.
THEY SPEAK BANTU
Mr Raw!
Take Mr Vereker to the store and see he's issued the necessary equipment.
And then show him to the mess and explain to him how an officer's expected to behave.
Our good Col Durnford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
It's rumoured Lord Chelmsford's to make Durnford second-in-command. Typical of Her Majesty's Army!
Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.Now, now, Mr Melvill. Less of your spleen.
Stranger in the mess! Gentlemen, my lord.
Announce yourself.
Good day, Frederick.
Good day, William.
Pleased you could join us.It was that or join the Zulu.Join the Zulu?
Oh, yes, you're in the thick of it.

They fight with spears, don't they? Is that fair against a Martini-Henry?
Did you really choose between Britain and the Zulu?
A damn close thing it was, too. Ah, well done, Murphy.
Stranger's cup. Down it in one and we share your mess bill for a week.
And if I don't? You buy a bottle of good claret for each mess member.

Excuse me, ladies.
Did you get your farm going?
Yes, I did.
How was it?
I've never been so happy.
Sorry you had to leave.
You've met the Hon William Vereker, I believe.
Yes. We were childhood friends.
Your childhood friend shot a dead cow at the gallop yesterday.
Most impressive!
There is a Mrs Durnford, is there?
She exists but nothing's been heard of her the eight years Durnford's been in Africa.
Although much is spoken of her now, my lord.
I recommended him to you because he knows Africa so well.
Indeed. His ability to recruit native contingents is proving invaluable.
How do you rate him as a soldier?
It is widely held he has courage and he's an excellent engineer.
Shall we join the guests?
Do you think she might become interested in...someone?
Which one? The one who keeps looking at me.
Could be you flatter yourself - it's her odd eye.
They must've locked the good ones up!
Ah! General!
Do you find our border country congenial, my lord?
Landscape - congenial, ma'am. As a border - vulnerable.
Do you really think Cetshwayo will attack us?
The intention of the Zulu Impi and their king concern me deeply.
He has no intention of attacking Natal - unless he's given no option.
He has no quarrel with us.
How rare to meet a young lady interested in tactical matters!
Is it not most rare?
You are talking of a violent and murdering barbarian with an army of 30,000 warriors just across the river.
My father has lived with the Zulus for many years.
Cetshwayo massacred 20,000 people to become king!
The English Tudor kings did no less - much later in our nation's history, I might add.
And the French, much more recently.
That may well be, your grace, but be that as it may, my duty is clear...
..the defence of all this - Natal.
Yes.
Well, it's difficult to stand against that position -
IF you speak only of defence.
And what does our good Col Durnford think? >
If the people of Natal wish to feel safe, let them persuade their husbands and sons to volunteer. We need officers and men.
We do, Colonel. Good point.
I cannot be brought to believe that Cetshwayo wants a war with Britain.
Every Zulu is raised to be a warrior.
Without war, there's no Zulu nation.
Nobody is really safe, are they?
Mrs DeWitt has four daughters, Henry, and I fear she feels for them all. >
Your daughters may indeed be in some danger, Mrs DeWitt - but not from the Zulus.
MUSIC DROWNS OUT SPEECH
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please!
I think I should inform you that I am obliged to issue a notification declaring a state of war between Her Majesty's Government and the Zulu king, Cetshwayo, on his non-compliance with the ultimatum made on him, urging reparation and redress for violations of British sovereignty.
SCATTERED APPLAUSE
Why?
Why do men think of nothing but killing?
This is a wonderful land we're privileged to share.
Dear God...
..there should be room for all of us!
There goes No 2 Company.
Quartermaster. Quartermaster.
I'll see ya!
No-no!
Do I believe what me eyes see?
The whole bleedin' army moving off to meet the murdering heathen and what goes on in here? A game of brag! BRAG!
Sorry, Quartermaster.
You'll be more sorry when the Zulu ask, "What can you offer me not to slit your gut?"
And you'll say, "The knave of hearts, sir! The knave of hearts!"
THEY CHUCKLE Move!
For the savage, as for the child, chastisement is sometimes a kindness.
Let us hope, General, that this will be the final solution to the Zulu problem.
Come on, boys! Get up!
Quick! Calm down!
And again! Come back here, you thief!
About ready, sir.
My lord, I've prepared a list of ideas for you to see.
Excellent! Give them to Crealock.
My lord, this list was prepared for you. I don't think another can understand its true value.
Thank you, Col Durnford.
Gentlemen, within ten days we shall cross the Buffalo River and British soldiers will then be in Zululand.
Col Durnford will remain down-river and defend the Natal border.
Will you hear Last Post, sir?
I listened to your Stand To this morning. It was perfect.
Couldn't have done it better myself - even when I was bugler to Wellington.
Where did you get that black eye? The cooks saw me dip your shaving tin in their tea water. Made their tea taste of soap, they said.
So you got it in the line of duty.
Point taken.
Will we be fighting the Zulu soon?
Could be.
ATTAS!
When we cross the river into Zululand they might be waiting there for us to show up - them stabbing assegias pointing right at our bellies!
Are you afeard of the Zulu?
One Zulu is only one man, and I'm afeard of no one man!
But the Zulu, they come in thousands, like a black wave of death, in their thousands.
Them assegias, stabbing!
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
I am to take the Sikali with the main column to the river.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
Chelmsford wants a good man on the border - he fears a flanking attack and wants you in reserve.
The wrong side of the river, the wrong place?!
Does he wish me to fight the Zulu or merely observe their habitat?
Sir.
God go with you, Mr Vereker.
SOLDIERS: Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip! Hooray!
GET UP NOW! GET ON!
Get off his arse, you bloody idiot!
KEEP 'EM IN LINE!
Sarge! Sarge! I'm drowning, Sarge!
What the hell do you mean by having the same name as me?!
Sorry, Sarge!
Do you think Cetshwayo will send a party to greet you?
They're here. We just have to ensure they don't get back to announce us.
You mean you've seen them?
Forward, Sikali!
Come on! Come on!
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Nogg, sir. Actual name is Norris Newman. He's from The Standard.
Our runners bear his dispatches, do they not?Of course!
Come on, lads! It's only a river!
Come on! Make it today!
Come on, you lot! Get these bastards across!
It's only water! You'll only get wet! Come along, you idle scum!
Break that ammunition crate and I'll have your guts for garters!
An historic moment, don't you think?
Norris Newman of The Standard. I saw you lead our cavalry.
Indeed. I was one of the first across.Were they in good heart?
They spurred onto the high ground, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu.
Full of sport, they were, my lord.
Tell what you see, write it well, sir, and make sure you get it right.
If I've got it right, my lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand -
I see it all around me - but "Why?" is the question my readers will ask. "Why?"
Do not confuse yourself.
Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
So attack is your defence.
Well, let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis for destruction.
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid engagement.
I have it, my lord, we attack for sport. Or is it reputations?
Enough of your politicking, Noggs.
I know your views on the press but people want to know what the regiments are doing.
Then I trust you will tell them exactly what you've observed.
Tricky business, Mr Bloomfield.
Look at that waste!
Five rounds ruined. Each round has to be accounted for.
It's terrible! Quite dreadful! Something must be done!
If they'd been put back in their boxes, the boxes screwed down - as his lordship ordered - nothing would've happened to them.
I refer to our drowned natives.
Natives is not on my invoices, Mr Harford.
Ammunition is, and has to accounted for, AND brass cartridge cases returned.
Several natives went under. Shouldn't we have a roll call?
Not practical - we haven't had time to make up the roll yet.
Besides, I'm not sure how many we had before the crossing.

I'm ill. Dozens of them followed me.
I must've shot five, six, ten - I lost count.
They just kept coming! Blood-curdling swine!
Why did they attack you? I discovered their army. ..A valley full of them.
- What army? - Beyond them hills and coming this way.
Mr Vereker, would you mind taking a look at this map?
By all means, Colonel.
Your wagons, Colonel. What about my wagons?
On this open slope you must bring them round and form them into a laager - immediately.
I hear you have prisoners, Colonel. Well done! Evening, William!
Thank you, sir!
I think you should hear this. Your brother didn't laager his camp... >
They had 73 in their party - they found 73 skeletons six months later.
Boers require a laager with only a few wagons - we have many.
An unassailable square of British fire power is a defence which can be formed in a moment. You're leaving us?
I'm going to camp among the rocks over there.
My lord, Mr Fannin claims to have seen the Zulu Impi - some few thousand or so - exactly here in this valley.
Unlikely - it would mean taking 24,000 men over mountain tops.
This is not helpful!
Have the prisoners brought to my camp.
SOLDIERS LAUGH All right, Corporal. Anything?
No, sir. Nothing.
Be sensible, man! Tell us!
Good evening! Dirty work, eh?
Very dirty.
PRISONER SPEAKS IN ZULU
What did they say?Claim they're deserters from the Impis in the east.
Followed this one so they could give themselves up, go home.
Do you believe that?
They're well oiled, fed regularly - it's unlikely they're fugitives.
Have them questioned further.
They claim the Impis are east towards the Royal Kraal and yet this fellow says they're further towards the north.
Wherever they are, there are 60,000 or more.
They multiply, Mr Fannin. You speak the Zulu tongue?
Tomorrow I intend to find the Zulu Impi and you will accompany me.
I'm no soldier, your honour, and it's further into Zululand.
You will accompany me or you will me arrested.
This way, Mr Fannin.
Crealock, we have scouts where he claims he saw the Zulus?
Of course, sir.And?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Thank you.
Why don't the Zulus attack?
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but that doesn't mean to say they've got no brains.
They'll watch us and wait - find our weaknesses.
Have we weaknesses, Quartermaster?

Stand to!
Stand to, Colour Sergeant!
Who gave the order? Private Williams, sir.
I've got to see this!
Did you call stand to, Private?
I didn't hear nothing, Sarge!
POUNDING OF HORSES HOOVES
Well, stand to, damn you!
No, you done well for once. Don't push your luck.
I heard 'em first!
I'll get you a medal for modesty! Would you like that?
You never would, Colour Sergeant! A medal!
Colonel Durnford here!
Easy, lads.
Just follow the tracks, sir. You'll reach Lord Chelmsford's headquarters.
Sergeant.
Stand down, lads.
You done well! Keep it up, lad! Keep it up!
You want your reserves to cross the river?!
I have intelligence that the Zulu head north to threaten your left.
Intelligence?! Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours?!
Rumours to draw you off to leave Natal open to a counter-thrust?!
Cetshwayo wants a head-on battle, a decisive victory, so his people can get on with what truly matters - the delayed harvest.
Are you dictating the strategy of this war?!
I'm explaining my reasons.
Yes?A large party of Zulus has been sighted towards the King's Kraal.
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi.
Durnford, return to your unit and bring them here to support Pulleine.
Mr Vereker will join you as ADC.
The threat of counter-invasion no longer exists?
Colonel, if, on another occasion, you flout my orders,
I shall relieve you of your command.
Perhaps he has thought to conquer Zululand on his own, my lord.
BUGLER PLAYS "Reveille"
You will keep me informed of Col Durnford and his men when they arrive, William. Certainly, Frederick.
Gentlemen, we move to find camp and engage the enemy.
And my nose tells me we may make early contact.
Mr Melvill, until the reinforcement arrives, we will stand to.Sir!
You there! Sound the fall in!
BUGLER PLAYS "Fall In"
A huge expanse to keep an eye on!
Would you ride over to Stuart Smith?
Ask him to bring his artillery about.Sir!
Mr Melvill, send a lookout.
Tell him to call out the instant he sees Durnford's column approaching.
Stuart, how quickly can you move your artillery forward?
My horses are feeding. It will take a little while.
Pulleine wants them in position now.
Right. ..Bombadier, to me, please!
Close up, lads! Move on!
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs? 11 o'clock, my lord.
Our friend Colonel Durnford should be approaching Pulleine.
We'll eat here.
I shall scout that mountain and be back with an appetite in one hour.
SOLDIERS CHEER
What the...?!I'll fix him, Sarge. All right.
Shut that yelling up! You hear me!
ZULU CONTINUES SHOUTING
Did you hear me?!
Shut up!
SPEAKS ZULU
SOLDIERS CHEER
Exceedingly pleased to greet you, sir!
You're standing to. The men could eat with their equipment unbuckled.
Yes, of course! Excellent idea! Mr Melvill, order stand down!Sir!
Please.
Sergeant, stand the men down.
Crealock, old fella,
I'm doing notes for my dispatch and I need to clear up a few military points.
I don't want to bother his lordship.
I had it drummed into me that a good commander never willingly splits his force - especially in an enemy's country - before knowing their dispositions.
If we were facing a European enemy with guns, your point would hold.
May I remind you, I do not create the strategies you comment on.
I'm only his lordship's secretary.
I wouldn't take overly comfort from that, Crealock, old fella, because if he sinks, then you sink with him.
So, you've been asked to look after me, Lieutenant.
I assure you, sir, I have no desire to create difficulties.
And I say you do not. I'd be obliged for your advice.
What have your scouts seen? So far, only THEIR scouts.
But we've had reports of a small Impi further north, over there.
His lordship believes it's far too difficult an approach to be chosen by the Zulu command.
Yes, well, difficulty never deterred a Zulu commander. How many?
We don't know.
I think it would be wise to picket the hills.
Just in case.

Wheel 'em in! Wheel 'em in! Wheel 'em in!
Come on, now!
Tighten those ranks!
Private Storey, get those range markers pegged out at the double - one every 100 yards!
Make sure he pegs them in a straight line TOWARDS the enemy.
Hold them, please, God!
For three minutes, please hold them!
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on, men!
96, 97, 98, 99... What's next, boy?
Oi! You useless little bastard. Come here!
Look! Look!
ZULUS CHANT
Splendid site, Crealock! Splendid!
I want to establish camp here immediately.Certainly, sir.
After lunch, Brown, you shall return to Isandhlwana and instruct Col Pulleine to join us here.
If you'll excuse me, my lord. No appetite, Colonel?
My men last ate yesterday and have no supplies until I get them back to Isandhlwana.
They can start now and you can join them when you've eaten.
It wouldn't be proper for me to sit at your table, they with their bellies stuck to their backbones.
Excuse me, sir.
Learn nothing from that Irishman, Harford, except how NOT to behave.
LAUGHTER Thank you, sir.
Here, here!
A strange message from Vereker.
It would seem that Pulleine has a battle on his hands.
No details. No intelligence.
Mr Milne, kindly take your telescope to a high point and note events at Isandhlwana.
Sir!

But bullets run out. Those spears don't.

Do not issue ammunition from this wagon to any unauthorised company.

Go and get it from your own wagon.

Present! Fire!
Hurry up with that bloody ammo!
My lord!
My lord, I watched the camp for 20 minutes.
The haze obscures much. The tents have not been struck but the wagons have been moved into the camp.
Thank you, Mr Milne. Inform Col Crealock, will you?Sir!
Thank you, Milne.
The camp is under attack. Pulleine sends for help.
Be calm! Where do you come by this?
Durnford's carbineer rode in. Col Harness has turned the artillery.
They have?
I see. Ride out to Lord Chelmsford and acquaint him with this.
Mr Harford!
Control your passions! The professional soldier must keep cool.

Get to Rorke's Drift. You must warn them.
The Colours!
Carry them to safety, Mr Melvill.
Sir!

Take my horse!
Off you go! Sergeant, ride back to Natal.
Tell the bishop - that is, tell his daughter -
I was obliged to remain here with my infantry.
Now go! God go with you!
I leave God Jesus with you.

Give them to me! Come on!
COME ON!
For God's sake, hold them back! I'll get the horses!
It's all right! It's all right!

Excuse me, my lord, there's something I must convey to you.
I rode a little along the track to Rorke's Drift - the sky is red with fire.

Do we move to the Drift?
A DOG WHINES
ZULUS SING
- Oh, hi, Sarge.
- Al.
What are you doing up at this hour?
- Night shift.
- Want the usual?
Just some milk.
How's McQ? Haven't seen him lately.
You know, Lon and his boat.
He's living on it.
How's the gut?
It's not bad.
Good. I got something cooking out back.
- You need anything, give a holler.
- Right.
Hello.
Oh, nuts.
Yeah?
Lon, J.C., did you hear?
What?
I'm sorry, Lon.
Stan went down this morning.
How bad?
Shotgun in the back. He's in Harborview.
They're working on him now.
Get Doc Merar over there.
He's here.
- Lois would like to see you.
- How's she doing?
Gutsy. Holding up.
Well, don't leave her alone.
Get a policewoman with her.
Now, what happened?
Don't know. No witnesses.
Coffee shop guy heard the blast, but didn't see a thing.
Well, pull the package on Manny Santiago.
I want an intelligence update on him, and I want to see Stan's log.
Lon, two other officers got taken off, too. Nine millimeter.
Beat man named Hyatt and Wally Johnson.
You know, he works the night watch in Property.
Yeah.
Kosterman thinks it's militants.
See you.
Hold it!
- All right, now. Just stay back.
- Don't worry.
You know him, Lieutenant?
Patty Samuels. I know him.
He's a hit man. He was waiting for me.
Pete, call the medical examiner.
I better have that for the inquest, Lieutenant.
Hey, mister, that was a hell of a shot.
I called the cops for you.
Yeah, thanks.
- You saw what happened?
- I saw you shoot him.
- And before that?
- I saw him blasting away at you.
Good. Now I want you to repeat what you saw just exactly the way it happened.
- Hey, look, I don't wanna get involved.
- You already are.
I have a tape recorder here.
- Are you a cop?
- Yeah.
Tell him what happened.
Officer, witness this.
Well, hell, I was just on my way to work...
Name and address first.
My name is James Carter, and I live at 1131 North 74th.
I was on my way to work this morning when I saw this guy trying to break into this car, some young kid.
And then this guy came out and chased him away and this other guy started shooting at him, see, and then the first guy blasted him.
You know, it was a hell of a shot.
- Lon.
- Stan's tough, Lois.
Don't forget it.
- How bad?
- Critical.
He liked to work, Lon.
He thought being a cop was the greatest.
Well, he's still a cop, and he's still gonna be one.
Sure.
I'm not surprised he was shot.
I've been expecting it.
All wives expect it these days, don't you know that?
Some crazy getting it off, a radical doing his number.
We don't have to talk about it now.
You've got some questions, though, haven't you?
Well, another time.
It's all right.
Police work never stops, does it?
I'm sorry, Lon.
What do you wanna know?
I know he was taking you to a show last night.
How did he end up alone?
He got a call.
From whom?
I don't know, but it was important.
I could see his face.
I could feel the tightening in his stomach.
You know how he was.
- Did you hear what was said?
- Just pieces.
Well, I have a feeling it had something to do with the drive on against the dealers.
Just a feeling, that's all.
The department dries up the city, someone tries to dry up Stan.
Any names mentioned?
Manny Santiago's, for instance?
No. I would have remembered that for sure.
Well, Lois, I hate to, but I'm just gonna to have to go.
- Can I call somebody, a friend?
- Lon, don't baby me.
I'm tough, too, remember?
We'll all be back out on that boat again soon.
You'll see.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Calling Dr. Denon. Dr. Denon.
Okay, let's go. Everybody out.
Hold it down in there!
- Good morning, Captain.
- Good morning.
I'm in the communications center right now.
Yeah.
Captain Kosterman just walked in.
Yes, sir.
Chief, the mayor wants to see you.
- Tell him I'm on my way.
- He's on his way.
All right, Ed. It's your ball game.
I want your best people on this, and I want quick action.
Yes, sir.
This gets top priority.
If there's anything you need, just ask.
I'll talk to you when I get back.
- How's Stan?
- He's hanging in there.
Boy, that's rough.
Homicide's looking for you.
They want your papers on the Patty Samuels thing.
And the captain's looking for you.
I think you've got him worried.
I put Stan's log on your desk and the Santiago stuff.
All the same.
Arrested on a felony, booked on a misdemeanor, released.
- Yeah, he beats them all.
- Yeah.
I, uh... I got us fight tickets for Thursday.
Don't suppose we'll be needing them now.
My schedule will be busy.
See you.
You know, your Green Hornet is an attractive nuisance.
Someday, somebody's gonna rip it off.
Maybe me.
You can have the payments, too.
- Captain Kosterman wants to see you.
- Okay. Dean.
Have one of the girls type that up, will you?
Good morning, Frank.
Watching Kosterman's show?
Sorry about Stan. How is he doing?
- He's trying.
- Yeah.
Listen, if there's anything I can do for him, for Lois, you'll let me know, will you?
Thanks.
Hey, McQ.
What is this asinine police crap?
This is illegal arrest, man.
This is unconstitutional, and you damn well know it.
This whole damn place is coming down, you know that?
You pigs are gonna be out of work, but don't worry about it.
We'll put you on welfare.
That's all your stinking job is anyway.
Come on, pig. Shoot me.
Pull your piece and blow me up right here.
What's the matter? No guts?
Chicken?
God!
- What happened?
- He bumped into a chair.
Chair?
Good morning.
- Almost got you, huh?
- Close enough.
- You know how I feel about this.
- I saw the hallways.
Garbage. Garbage.
The whole place smells like rotten cheese.
They're gonna have to fumigate.
Ed, I think we should be looking for something else.
I'm willing to look at anything.
But uniformed officers shot down in the streets, that smells like radicals to me.
How about Patty Samuels unloading on me?
That's not radical.
Somebody thought Stan had told me something.
You're still harping on that Santiago thing.
Why not?
Ed, I want this case.
No, not this one.
I already put Burt on it.
Stan and you are too close friends.
You know how the department feels about that.
Emotional involvement clouds clear judgment.
We both know all you have to do is just say the word.
Well, I'm not saying it.
Lon, I know you.
I'm not gonna stand for you making up your own rules.
You're not gonna play that Mickey Peters thing all over again.
Peters was a hood, and everybody knew it.
Yeah, and you weren't satisfied with throwing him up on the roof.
You had to go up there and throw him back down.
Six months in the hospital, four lawyers screaming about his civil rights.
Well, it kept him off the street, didn't it?
Yeah, and that's why I'm behind a desk and you're taking orders from me.
Now, cool it.
- Telephone, Captain.
- Yes. Thank you.
Lon, cool it. Don't go away.
I'm not finished yet.
Captain Kosterman.
No. No, no. All press inquiries go to Chief Grogan's desk.
That goes for lawyers, too.
No, I don't want to talk to them.
Bye.
Captain Bennerman, Internal Affairs.
- Good morning, Mr. Santiago.
- Good morning.
- Bob, I thought you'd be in court today.
- No, that's tomorrow.
I was worried about the detective who was shot last night.
I'm afraid there may be repercussions.
Why should that be?
I did not shoot him.
I was on an overnight plane from Mexico City.
I know that, Manuel.
But it's my responsibility to caution you about the possibility of harassment.
- Good morning, Mr. Santiago.
- Good morning, Chris.
Harassment. Such a nice lawyer's word.
Thank you, Bob. You're very conscientious.
How is he?
Critical.
Shame.
...handling the modern supertankers, eliminating the need for the ships to travel.
Detective Sergeant Stan Boyle died late this morning at Harborview Hospital, victim of shotgun wounds sustained early this morning.
Boyle's assailant remains at large.
Police investigations continue.
This is your weather girl, Barbara Bogey, with today's report on Seattle and vicinities.
High today in the upper 50s.
Low overnight of 42.
Cloudy, clearing in the late afternoon.
What was just on the news?
Sorry. I wasn't paying any attention.
The detective that got shot this morning, he died.
...400 miles off the coast of British Columbia with a cold front extending west-southwest...
Two climbers from Washington state are reported missing...
So, one less detective to worry about.
Yeah, one less detective to worry about.
I got a message from Patty Samuels.
He's sorry he blew it on McQ, but he rang it up with Boyle.
Send that widow a Japanese tea set.
- Who are you?
- Who? I'll show you who.
That's who.
Patty Samuels made a deathbed statement.
You put up 10 grand to go bang on Boyle and me.
- You're insane!
- Yeah?
What's the matter? No confession?
Even under duress?
He's taking a shower.
The damn phones haven't stopped ringing.
Upstairs, the city council.
The man has clout.
What did you expect?
His lawyer was gonna let it die?
I never touched him.
Sure, we talked, but he slipped on the wet floor and fell.
He says otherwise. So do his men.
They're his men.
You're off the investigation, Lieutenant, pending review.
What's all this?
Everybody knows that Santiago is the biggest dealer in the city, in spite of his cover.
Intelligence knows it, and so do the feds.
His "H" comes in from Canada by mule...
Just file your report, Lieutenant.
The commission will be pleased to consider whatever you have to say.
A date will be set for the review board, and you will be notified.
That's it. Until further notice, you're on a desk.
I tried to warn you.
No, wait.
- Wait a minute, Lon, don't do that.
- Too much politics.
Come on. Don't do that.
Go away and think about it.
You put in too many years here, Lon.
You got a good record, a damn good record, of arrests and convictions.
Frank, let him go.
He was never part of the team anyway.
Yeah, run it smooth.
Don't do anything. Don't rock the boat.
- You mean to infer that...
- I can infer anything I want now, Chief.
I'm a civilian again.
What happened?
Run this through the lab for me, will you?
See if you can get me a make.
- Lon?
- I'll call you.
- Lois?
- I hope you don't mind my coming down.
I just couldn't sit home.
Glad you did.
Welcome aboard.
Oh, my high-heel shoes.
Oh, you can't hurt these decks.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
No.
Let me fake it.
Thanks for holding my hand at the funeral.
Big turnout, wasn't it?
Stan had a lot of friends, that kind of a fella.
The city went all out.
Fifty motorcycles, all that media coverage.
God, why does anybody want to be a cop?
How about a drink?
Yeah.
I'm glad now we never had any kids.
Maybe it would have been better having some. Who knows?
It's all right. Alcohol purifies.
How do you stand it, this living in solitary?
You get used to it.
Water or soda?
It doesn't matter.
You should get yourself a woman.
She'd at least straighten up for you.
Not enough for them anymore.
Women's lib, you know.
Growing up, isn't she?
You still do your Sundays?
Wouldn't miss them for anything.
Why should you?
If you've got something good, keep it.
I saw your ex in the papers.
She and Forrester at some lawyers' meeting.
He sure got up there all of a sudden.
I'm glad for her.
Well, Lois, what are your plans?
I don't know. I'm all mixed-up.
Lon, can I be your sister?
Sure.
I'd like that.
All I had were three brothers.
We were always banging knuckles.
Then let's do something crazy, brother.
Let's get in your car and go someplace.
Canada.
Let's get lost for about 10 years. Yes.
Ten years is just about right.
It's all right, isn't it?
Get it out.
It's all right. It's over.
I am tough, see?
What about you?
I heard you quit.
Congratulations.
Nothing lost.
Creeps have made all the gains.
Cops get to listen to lots of organ music.
Go get yourself a good job.
Yeah.
- Pinky?
- Huh?
I parked in your spot.
It doesn't matter.
The car's in the shop anyway.
- New bills, huh?
- Yeah.
Sorry about Boyle.
Yeah.
Want a beer?
No, thanks.
Pinky, I want to come in with you.
Lon, there's hardly enough for me.
Some bad checks, door shaking.
Even divorce has gone sour.
Dissolution is putting us out of business.
No salary.
I need the cover of your license, Pinky.
Looking for a base?
That's right. I'll bring my own client.
- Who?
- Me.
I get it. Stan's killing.
Do-it-yourself gumshoeing, huh?
Why quit? Why don't you just take a leave?
Freer this way.
There's a lot of badasses on the street carrying your bruises.
They'd love to catch you without the protection of the departmental umbrella.
Well, that's part of the bundle, Pinky.
How about it?
Well, if that's what you want, we'll get you registered.
Gee, will Kosterman get hot.
Okay, sign right there, will you, Lon?
His name's Freddie LaSalle.
He's a contract man from St. Louis.
How did he get by the airport watch?
Who knows? Drove in.
Any surveillance on him?
Would be if we could find him.
Well, how about intelligence?
Why is he here?
Nothing.
Well, I'm located now. Pinky's.
You got his number?
I can get it.
I'm depending on you to keep me up on things.
Well, I'll do what I can, Lon, but my neck only goes out so far.
That's the only way to go.
Rosey? It's me.
Did you get any more...
None of your snitches will help you now.
They know you can't deal anymore.
The hell I can't.
- Don't park it. I'm not staying.
- Yes, sir.
- Lon, this is a surprise.
- Yeah. Nice party.
We're trying to raise some money for a foster-parent program.
It's awful about Stan.
I tried to reach Lois. I'll keep trying.
- I heard you resigned.
- That's right.
I'm glad.
I'm sorry, too, that it didn't happen a long time ago.
Is Ginger around? Back from school?
She should be here any minute.
Elaine,
I need $5,000.
I hope it's for a woman.
Someone patient, brave, and caring, who doesn't break out in rashes being left alone at night.
I'll have to ask Walter.
Hello, Lon.
Walter.
- You're looking fit.
- You, too.
How about Elaine?
- Looks marvelous, doesn't she?
- Always did.
- Walter, Lon wants $5,000.
- A loan.
I have $6,000 or $7,000 coming from my pension, but I won't get it for three months, and I need the money right now.
- All right.
- I've drawn up this paper.
The fund will pay you directly.
That's not necessary, Lon.
Just pay me back when you can.
I'd rather do it this way.
All right. I'll get a check.
Goodbye.
Daddy! Hi!
Hello, Ginger.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.
Look at this, 99 out of 100. I'm a genius.
I've got a couple of tickets to the Sunday basketball game.
How about it?
Gee, Dad, Jane invited me to her house at the marina.
It's her birthday and she's having a boy-girl party, my first one.
Well, then you'll have to go to Janie's.
- Maybe next week.
- If there's not another party.
I'm getting very popular.
I think it's my charm.
I called the bank and told them you'd be down to cash it.
There will be no difficulty.
Well, thanks, Walter.
I'll see you.
What's the score?
The Lakers are doing it to them righteously.
Hey, there's my man.
I'm gonna transact some business.
Why don't you ladies go and get something to eat?
Get Daddy something, too, here, and you be really sweet to yourself.
What you got for me, my man?
Hey, that's all right.
Walsh's playing, huh?
Okay. I'll tell you what, I'm going to run about three on this one, and two...
Watch it.
Shi...
Hey, baby, give me the hot dogs.
Stay right here.
Daddy's got some more business to take care of.
- Hello, Rosey.
- Hey, man. I don't have to talk to you.
You're not the heat anymore, you know what I mean?
- Like, you're useless.
- Hold it, Rosey.
What are you going to do?
Go fist city on me?
I can dig that, you know, a week in the hospital.
Rest and relaxation for me, you know what I mean?
There's five bills in this newspaper.
I don't even sneeze for less than 10.
All right.
Let's turn to the second section.
There's five more if it's beautiful.
Santiago has got company from out of state.
Freddie LaSalle?
That's worth zip.
- Enjoy the game.
- There's more.
More hardware.
A cat by the name of German called from Denver.
Two hit men.
Three. A Lou Something-Or-Other from Miami.
Santiago is collecting a murder squad.
- Something else.
- What?
You know, you'd be surprised how the cost of living
- has gone up in the black community.
- It stops right here.
A heist team.
A heist team? Rosey, you're shining me on.
No, no, man, this is the straight skinny.
It must be something special.
Drugs?
You know Santiago. Now, what's his bag?
Did Stan find something out?
Hey, man. He's got his own connections.
You ask them.
I'm missing all the action, babe.
Rosey, if this is a shine,
I'm coming back and ironing your face.
Personally, I think it's worth more.
I'll get you some Blue Chip Stamps.
Cocaine, Sal? Let's have them, Sal.
The balloons. Spit them out.
- Spit them out!
- Hey, what the hell is this?
You ain't even a cop anymore!
- Go see some basketball.
- Basketball?
Geez. You've got a nerve, picking your way in here.
What is this?
I've got a good mind to call a cop.
- So what?
- I thought you might be interested.
Why should I be? I'm no doper.
Where did you get that idea?
Look, I'm tired.
I've been hustling drinks for 10 hours.
My feet hurt, my back hurts, and I need a bath.
So go on.
Let's cut through it, Myra.
You were a good friend of Stan's in the past.
Well, he was a nice guy.
He was a gentleman.
Gentleman.
It was a damn shame.
Not that there was ever anything between us.
Personal, I mean.
We were just good friends.
Sure, I know that. He respected you.
You bet he did.
He brought the balloons and you spoke of things in general.
If I hear anything, it's my civic duty to tell the right person.
Geez. Who else knows?
- Why don't you guys print up a program?
- Nobody knows, Myra.
I was just Stan's very good friend.
Well, I talked only to Stan, not his very good friend, and I'm not talking to you.
I don't like you. I never did.
You're a bear.
I don't like bears. Out.
Okay.
Wait.
Skag or coke?
I don't go skag.
I know what you go, Myra.
Can I see one?
You have a bill handy?
"C" note. Class.
Roll it for me, will you, like a good fella?
Do you mind? It hurts my eyes.
You see, the lounge is dark all of the time, so my pupils get dilated.
Dilated pupils is a natural condition with me.
That's why some people think I'm a coker.
Myra, did Stan have some information?
Was that why he was killed?
Why don't you take off your coat?
Aren't you hot?
- Personally, I think it's hot.
- Know anything about a drug heist?
- Think I'm fat?
- No, I think you look real nice.
Yeah?
Aw. I'm fat. Baby fat.
It needs lifting. Even that won't help.
What I need is a complete overhaul.
Myra, I'm asking you something.
Sure, honey.
I'll tell you.
Be glad to.
In the morning.
You said I looked real nice. You said it.
Myra, in your job you must meet a lot of younger men around.
Oh, sure.
Phone rings day and night, don't you know, but I'm ignoring it.
I'm picking you, honey.
- How about some coffee?
- Hi.
Hey, I'll... I'll fix some bacon and eggs.
Okay? You cool it...
Oh, thanks, Myra, but I got a big day.
Oh, sure.
I'm busy myself.
Myra.
I don't know what Stan knew.
I didn't tell him.
I didn't know myself until yesterday.
- Some hard rocks from out of town.
- What's the setup?
Drug heist, like you thought.
They're going for the biggest stash in the city.
- Where?
- You're the detective.
Detect.
Give me some help.
Look where the men in blue hang out.
- I can't believe it.
- So go find out.
Only thing is, you better hurry.
- Hello, Joe.
- Hi, Lon, how are you doing?
All right.
- 2549, cocaine.
- Check.
- 2268, heroin.
- Check.
Hi, Steve.
Hi, Lon. What brings you around?
Just picking some stuff up out of my locker.
- How's it going?
- Not bad.
The wife's having a little problem, though.
- You know women.
- Yeah.
- She's going to the hospital tomorrow.
- That's too bad.
That concludes it.
- Sign here, please
- Okay.
Would you believe you're looking at over $2 million?
I sure would.
Where are they burning it this time, Sarge?
- Beats me. State secret.
- See you.
Sorry.
Hey.
What are you doing down there?
I'm looking for a restroom.
Well, it's not down here.
It's upstairs and to the left.
Thanks.
- Howdy, Sarge.
- Good morning.
Drop the boxes! Drop them!
Dr. Chaplin to the emergency room, first floor.
Take off!
Are you crazy?
Get out of that truck!
Open those rear doors.
- Who are you working for?
- I work for the laundry company.
Well, why did you blast through those stop signs?
The way you was chasing me,
I thought you were some sort of nut.
Well, maybe I am. Take off.
Professional all the way.
We found the linen truck.
The switch had already been made.
How much did they get?
Property is totaling it up now.
Megabucks. Must be
$2 million wholesale, anyway.
Robbing the police. Man, that's beautiful.
Chief wants to see you at half past...
Captain Windott's on his way over.
I'll bet he is.
Sergeant Kennedy. Yeah. Let me have it.
Now, what the hell was that?
Just what the hell was that?
You hot-dogging it around like that!
I wasn't sure on my information, but the time...
You didn't have to be sure.
Your responsibility is to let us know.
My responsibility is to my client.
Nothing in the law says I have to tell you anything.
Oh?
Okay.
Then you better tell your client to find himself a new private.
Pending a look into that shootout, there will be a little delay in approval of Pinky's request to take you on.
We're all set, Captain.
I'll search Santiago's place.
I'll cover his house, but even if he's got it, he's not gonna have his stash there.
Ed, you've gotta help me with something here.
Let's just say for a minute McQ is right and that Santiago needed the dope to supply his people, so he brought in this robbery team, right?
Now, you tell me, how did he know when state was gonna move it?
Or how did he know where it was gonna be burned?
Now, I understand that's private information.
- That's right.
- Yeah.
State sets the time and the place.
- So somebody leaked it, right?
- Yes, somebody.
Well... Ed, what about a connection between the robbery and the murders of Boyle and the officers?
There's a connection, all right.
One of the officers shot was in Property.
Wally Johnson.
Frank, if there's a tie-in, we'll find it.
You're forgetting something. You're out.
And I wanna tell you something. I'm glad.
Just a minute, you still carrying?
Better leave it.
For the time being, your permit is revoked.
And if you give me any more of your crap, you're gonna find that employment of any kind is just a little out of your reach.
Now, if you want me to hit you harder,
I can do that, too.
Sir, Captain Windott's here.
Oh, hi, Phil. Get out.
- Ed, don't you think McQ here...
- Frank!
- Phil. How are you?
- Fine.
Looks like we've got a problem.
You know Franklin Toms, field deputy, city council.
- Captain Windott.
- Frank.
- Nice to meet you.
- Let's go on inside, huh?
Let me know how the sweep comes out.
- I'll be going by Lois' house tonight.
- Okay, Lon.
- Hey, Lon.
- Jack.
- What are you doing?
- Buying a gun. This one.
Got a minute?
I got something I wanna show you in back.
Lon, I have a little equalizer here.
We're gonna try to sell it to the department.
- The Ingram.
- Ingram, huh?
- Nine millimeter.
- Six, seven pounds?
6.25. The silencer makes a nice handle.
Lon, this can here is filled with water.
Go on. Squeeze off a burst.
Why not?
How about that?
Those 32 slugs came out in a second and a half.
Yeah.
Did you ever see anything like it?
You're not going to take it, are you?
Just say it's a loan.
Lon, it's not licensed!
Jack, neither am I.
I am going down to see my folks.
Why don't we get into that Green Hornet of yours and go down together?
I'd like to, but...
I see.
Lon, why don't you catch on?
Police work can't be done these days.
Crime isn't just organized, it's institutionalized.
Thanks.
And you're blowing it, you know.
What?
Your allotment, brother. You're off the force. You won't get licensed.
You're no kid, you're empty.
Why don't you do something filling?
I wanna know who did it and why.
You'd think I would, too, wouldn't you?
Hello. Yes, he's still here.
- Hello.
- Lon, J.C. The search is over.
- What happened?
- What we figured. Zip.
Okay, J.C. Thanks.
Go on home.
- Nothing.
- Santiago doesn't have it.
He has it, all right.
He's probably driving it around town.
That's the standard procedure.
Now, what do you think would be a safe place to stash it?
- Where the police have already been.
- I think you're right.
Do you have to leave?
- No big hurry.
- Refill?
Why not?
Lon, can I tell you something?
Stan and I were having trouble for a long time.
We were in the same bed, but it was just sleeping.
Did he say anything?
- Did he tell you I was leaving him?
- No.
I thought you two knew everything about each other.
Everything and nothing.
I really don't want you as a brother.
I guess I never did.
That's the danger of the buddy system.
Maybe the manual needs rewriting.
- Maybe it does.
- Why not?
A couple of empties.
Like in the songs, let's help each other through the night.
- Hi.
- Frank, come in.
- Frank?
- Hey, Lon. I didn't know you were here.
I'm glad you are. I need to talk with you.
I need to talk with both of you, as a matter of fact.
Sit down. Would you like a drink?
No. Yeah, I will. Give me a Scotch and water, if you don't mind, please.
The commission asked me to stop by, Lois, to see if you needed anything, if you wanted anything.
- I'm fine, thanks, Frank.
- Okay.
And about that job, I think I can...
Well, I know I can get you clerical work in accounting, but if you can hold on just a little bit longer,
I heard... Thank you. I heard a better job was gonna open in Public Affairs.
- Sounds good to me.
- Good.
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry about the hassle they've been giving you downtown, Lon.
And I agree with you,
Ed's on the wrong track.
I mean, he's got this bug about the militant angle, see.
And there's gotta be more to it than that.
So, I'm gonna talk with him.
I'm gonna change his mind.
That would be a start.
But if I were you,
I'd cool it for a little while, anyway, because it just seems to me you're damned exposed.
Yeah.
Have you eaten? And you?
Let's all have dinner someplace.
I'd like that, but I guess it'll have to wait till another time.
Good night, Lois. See you tomorrow.
Just ease the gun out.
Make yourself comfortable.
I guess I was expected.
Breaking and entering. Very serious.
Robbery and possession of narcotics.
You're in more trouble than I.
We shall see.
Look.
I don't like what you did to me.
I suppose I can understand it, the rage of a man who's lost a good friend.
But I don't like what you did to me.
I kind of enjoyed it myself.
You interrupted my coffee. Have some.
No, thanks.
Come on, now. Relax.
One spoonful or two?
Two.
It has been my observation that policemen like their coffee sweet.
Sugar!
All of it. Sugar!
We've stolen sugar!
Do you understand what's happened?
A switch has taken place.
And where?
Where else but the police department itself?
Actually, I find it quite charming.
I arrange a robbery, a very difficult robbery.
Stealing from the police itself.
But before I can steal from them, they steal from me.
My heart bleeds for you.
If you're bleeding, it's for yourself.
Your people are the violators.
Proof again of how unfair things are.
The advantage always lies with the people on the inside.
Who?
You ask me?
How do I know?
I'm on the outside.
But big people, it would seem.
A big operation.
Who else but big people?
How about Stan Boyle? Did you blast him?
I had no reason.
Possibly he discovered what was taking place.
Perhaps it's been going on for a long time.
Maybe everything that was ever burned was sugar.
Now, I find that concept fascinating.
Certain officials are my competitors.
See what the world has become?
Well, I can't help you.
Then go.
I have nothing to fear from you.
All this will be destroyed and no one will know of my embarrassment, except those very clever officials.
Of course.
One more thing.
I don't see anything.
What'd he hit you with?
Powdered sugar. The hell with that, Pinky.
Let's get on with it.
Well, let's see what we can put together.
- Now, there are two separate frolics here.
- That's right.
Santiago arranged the heist, and he came up a loser.
Insiders pulled this job.
Wally Johnson stood the morning watch alone.
It would have been easy for him to slip out the dope and slip in the sugar.
His murder, Hyatt's, and Stan's all connect.
And no militants mixed up in it, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. And that makes you wonder, doesn't it, why Kosterman was so eager to stick them.
Yeah, doesn't it?
And that's why I need you.
So you check IRS, his bank accounts, any girlfriend he might have on the side.
You know the routine.
Kosterman. That's heavy.
- What are you gonna do?
- I've got my own angle.
He probably collected and stashed that dope by now.
If it's not on the street already.
- Sergeant Davis.
- J.C.?
This is Lon.
- Can you talk?
- Go.
Has a new supply of junk hit the streets?
Not a thing, Lon.
Well, let me know if it does.
Sure. What is it? What are you into?
Don't ask. Just answer.
It's best that way.
McQ.
Coffee.
Go outside and bring the car around front, baby.
We're not gonna be here much longer.
The air in here got foul.
Just go get the car, baby, and be cool.
What the hell is wrong with you, McQ, coming here?
Don't get excited, Rosey.
I hear you're holding out on me.
What are you trying to do, man, run me out of business?
Your stuff's coming down from headquarters, some top brass.
What the hell are you talking about, McQ?
I get from Santiago. You know that.
I don't know anything about any cops, either.
I think you do, and I wanna hear it.
- Okay, but not here.
- Here. Now.
You know what will happen to me if I'm seen with you on my tail?
Man, I'll be out of business in a week.
Look, McQ, on the force or off, you are bad news, and if anybody was dirty, you ought to know who.
What do you mean by that?
Boyle, your buddy. That's who.
Now, there's a cat that smelled bad all the way.
Back that up, Rosey.
Give me something solid to support it.
Street talk.
The same way I get everything else for you, street talk.
You ever bad-talk Boyle again,
I'll kill you.
Myra?
Hi.
I don't know if it's healthy being seen with you.
- I hear you're making a lot of people mad.
- Uh-huh.
Sit down a minute.
You heard about the drug heist, the hit on the state narco officers.
Yes, it's been all over the TV.
And there's a rumor that somebody down at headquarters isn't clean.
I don't know anything about that.
You wouldn't be holding out on me, Myra?
- I'm a tired man.
- No.
I'm not dealing, Lon,
- but when you are rested...
- You know something?
You are attractive.
Oh, sure.
That's all that a girl like me needs, is a liar like you.
You sure you won't come in?
Thanks.
Well, if you should change your mind, you know where I'll be.
No, no. That's all right. Thank you.
Good night.
Just a minute, Lon, honey. I'm coming.
Oh, no.
Hello.
Lon, where the hell have you been?
I've been trying to reach you.
- What did Myra tell you?
- Nothing.
She didn't know a thing.
Well, somebody thought she did.
She's been killed.
Damn.
What the hell?
What the hell?
- Holy Jesus!
- Look at that.
Get some foam on this thing.
- Where are you?
- In the back.
- How bad are you hurt?
- How the hell do I know?
Get some foam on this thing.
I'm up to my butt in gas.
Well, there's no fracture.
I don't see any other apparent injuries.
Well, it may not be apparent, but you ought to feel it from my side.
You've been banged up pretty good.
Watch this hammer.
Keep your head still.
I think we'll keep you here overnight for observation.
Nurse, where is that head injury?
Well, as they say, you're a lucky man.
- What's with the car?
- Totaled.
You're gonna need new wheels, that's for sure.
It's time I got rid of it.
If it isn't being wrecked, it's being stolen.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Stay right here, Lieutenant,
I'll be with you in a minute.
Thank you, Nurse.
What do you think, Lon? Santiago?
No. He could have taken me anytime he wanted.
The whole thing's weird.
Why press you in iron?
It's not so weird if they wanted to separate me from that car.
- Where is it?
- Impound on Olive.
- Why?
- Just a thought.
Okay, I'll split.
If you need anything, I'll be at home.
- Say hello to Ellen.
- Right.
- What's this for?
- You.
No way.
Damn it, Lieutenant. We're busy around here. I say you get in this chair.
- Hospital regulations.
- And I say it's damn ridiculous.
All right, Lieutenant, but we're taking it up with us anyway.
I don't make the regulations, you know.
Why, you could be very seriously injured and not even know it.
Maybe you're right, Nurse.
I've had other cases like you, though.
Just last week I had three.
Two of them were okay, but one of them was... One of them...
Well, for Christ's sake.
Olive and 23rd.
Car 10 to radio.
Notify Captain Kosterman the subject just left the hospital.
All right, Lon, come on out.
We know you're in there.
Farrow.
Come over here.
What's going on?
What are you doing here?
I came to meet a friend.
What is going on?
Captain got an anonymous tip.
Lon's had the stolen dope in his car.
He's in there after it now.
- Lon?
- Why not?
Anyone can go bad.
Goodbye, Pinky, you're in the way.
Take him over there till I can get to him.
Come on, Lon, we know you're armed.
Now come out with your hands empty.
Lon, we got a lot of firepower out here.
Don't make me use any heat.
All right, Lon, you coming out?
Let's have the dog.
All right, bring him out.
Son of a bitch!
Lon, what happened?
The police were here looking for you
10 minutes ago.
- Where are you going?
- Down to see my folks.
All right. Get the car out.
Lon, what happened?
Come on, Lois.
All right, Lon. What happened?
Lon, for God's sake.
Stan was dirty.
I don't believe it.
I didn't want to, either.
He was in a frolic, all right, to steal dope from the Property section and sell it off.
The dope had been switched for sugar long before the heist.
It was stashed in my car.
I was hauling it around.
- What did Stan have to do with that?
- Everything.
I loaned him my car.
He said his was in the shop.
That's the way they got the dope in there.
You really mean it, don't you?
All the way.
I feel kind of silly acting like an avenging angel all that time.
I guess he thought a big crop would bring me back to him.
I'm glad he's dead.
I'll tell you this, I'm on his side.
Why not?
It's the new national sport called grabbing.
Everybody does it.
The senator sells privilege and the judge takes bribes.
This time it just happened to be Stan.
And some others.
Who?
Somebody tall. Somebody in.
Somebody who killed Wally Johnson and Stan so they could have more for themselves.
Kosterman?
- I'll find out.
- How?
Through you.
I feel kind of silly about that, too.
Lon, you're crazy.
That would be nice.
I'd like it better that way.
No, it started playing back to me, Lois, when you kept saying,
"Let's get in your Green Hornet and go someplace."
My car.
And not only once, at least twice.
You were in it together, but Stan got double-dealt.
You not only took him off your belly, you took him out of this world.
You and your new partner.
You are crazy.
We'll see, Lois.
I'm gonna stick with you until we find out who comes for this junk.
That's right.
Your friend took it out of my car, gave it to you to move it out of the city.
Now, let's see.
Is it in here?
Well, maybe it's in this one.
Well, then it has to be in this one.
Lon, for God's sake, there are $2 million there.
Lon, you like me.
I like you.
I can go anyplace. We can go together.
That turnoff up there, take it.
McQ! He's behind the car!
Franklin Toms.
Servant of the people.
Santiago.
McQ!
Can you hear me?
I want that junk.
McQ, are you listening?
I said, I want that junk!
What's your answer?
McQ, I'll purchase it from you.
Twenty-five cents on the dollar.
Fifty cents. Now, that's fair.
Come, now. Let's stop the nonsense, shake hands on an agreement.
If you want it so damn bad, come and get the stuff.
Get it.
Go on.
Lois.
Too bad.
Okay, Lon, I had it wrong, but I didn't turn in your badge.
I could tell you what you can do with it.
You...
Lon, it was my job.
I was transferred to Internal Security.
I've been on you all the way.
Yeah, it's your job.
Lousy damn junk.
All right, Lon, how about it?
There's a bar over there.
Let's get a drink.
- Destination, Monsieur?
- Monte Carlo.
Rue, de "boisie-arie."
Au rue Dubec, a droite a place "dee-l-eena."
Will you give it to me in English?
Sure. We're lost.
Thanks.
Hey.
- Herbie.
- What's he doing?
I think he's getting us un-lost.
Hi, there. Say, we're looking for the Trans
France Race Exposition.
Oui, straight ahead on your right.
You can't miss it.
- That's going to be some race.
- Yeah.
Well, you're looking at the winner right here.
This car? The winner?
- He didn't.
- He did.
All of this for the museum payroll?
The most magnificent diamond in the world.
L'etoile de Joie.
Could we have just a little peek?
On this very afternoon, at 1:00, precisely, you and all of Paris will be able to take the peek.
Now, fresh from his triumphs on the European racing circuit,
Bruno Von Stickle...
Who'll be driving his laser 917 GTE coupe.
Here we have a magnificent Pantera...
Ah, I see the American entry is just arriving, Mr. Jim Douglas.
Mr. Douglas will be driving a...
A...
Mr. Douglas will be driving a most unusual entry.
Something funny must've happened.
Huh. Us.
How about giving Jim Douglas and his partner,
Wheely Applegate...
A nice, warm welcome, huh?
This little car of yours is the toast of America.
When was your last win?
12 years ago.
That was only because, that was our last race.
Yeah.
Yes, this race... We're kind of staging a comeback here, and so it's very important to us.
I mean, we won't be coming back very far unless we qualify, will we?
Qualify? Are you kidding?
Don't let his modesty or this little car coming out of retirement fool ya.
There isn't a finer-tuned, cleaner engine anywhere.
I'm sure it should be easy to keep clean.
All you have to do is drop it in the washing machine along with your socks.
Appreciate your humour, but just don't you worry about this little washing machine... Car.
It's a real jewel.
But Monsieur Ribeaux, isn't it too much responsibility...
- For one man?
- One man?
One man and the finest security system that can be devised.
All in the computer.
Now, this alone will keep the diamonds safe from the grasp of a thief.
But, Monsieur, one would only have to reach in and...
The pillow is sensitive to the heat of the hand when it gets close to the diamond.
I'm sorry, Monsieur.
What does that do?
I'm engaging a system of electric eye beams that surrounds the pedestal.
One last precaution, gentlemen.
Would you please step out of the room?
Now the entire floor is a trap.
The mere ashes from a cigar would activate the alarm.
Right on schedule.
Only ten steps to six million dollars.
One step to Devil's Island if anything touches that floor.
Pardon, Monsieur Ribeaux, but you forgot to give me the computer and the numbers.
I did not forget.
They were put in my trust and will remain with me.
One does not part with the only copy in existence.
Patience, Quincey.
Electronics is the answer.
This notebook is our passport to the future.
I think I shall put my trust in this bit of rope.
When the man has it all worked out for us, silly not to use it.
You had to bring the whole kit, didn't you?
I was just checking for the radar beam.
It's there.
Now it isn't.
Some chunk of rock?
One could spend a lifetime without setting eyes on a rock like that.
You'll love getting your hands on it.
Ah.
Patience, Quincey.
Pillow's the trap.
One more set of numbers.
Why can't a man write an "o" that looks like an "o"?
Or is it a "9"?
Can't take a chance.
I don't trust nobody.
I'm glad I come prepared.
The old ways are still the best ways.
We've got six minutes before the guard checks.
Get on with it.
Aren't you ever gonna get that thing fixed?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I...
- Excuse me. Oh, I just...
- Oh.
Jim.
A word to the wise.
Paris may be the land of love, but it can also be the land of heartbreak.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll make a deal with you.
I'm willing to resist the girls, if you are.
- Well, that's some sacrifice.
- I know.
But I'm willing to make it.
You're made of strong stuff, Wheely.
Patience, patience, Quincey.
You tell that to the guard.
He'll be here in two minutes.
Give me that.
Well, we're coming into this big right hand sweeper, see.
Dropped him into third gear and really jumped on it.
Took three cars.
Then back into fourth, and we were flying.
Tach-in' seven or eight thousand.
We blew off the lead car 100 yards from the finish line.
Won it going away. How about that?
Je Ne comprens pas, parlez anglais.
I didn't understand what he was saying.
That's okay.
He didn't understand what you were saying either.
Come to think of it, I don't think
I understood what you were saying.
There's no more time.
That guard's practically in the door.
You want that stone, don't ya?
Yeah, and there's only one way to get it.
It's not possible.
Attention.
Attention, everyone, attention.
Nobody is to leave the area. I repeat.
- Nobody is to leave the area.
- We still have to qualify.
Come on.
- What's the trouble?
- I don't know.
Ladies and gentlemen, there has been a theft in the museum.
Everyone will be searched before leaving the area.
I repeat.
Nobody is to leave the area until they have been searched.
Here, mate, there's no point in us both getting caught, is there?
No point in either of us getting caught.
I repeat. Nobody is to leave the area.
I repeat. Nobody is to leave the area until he has been searched.
We'll never see it again.
That little car there?
Indeed you can.
It will be in a showroom on the Champs-Elysées at 4:30 this afternoon.
Yes, yes, yes.
But are you sure all the security precautions had been taken?
I've searched my memory.
Could I have forgotten something?
Inspector, some residue from a footprint.
I might have overlooked it, but I seemed to hear your voice calling out,
"Fontenoy, remember, no clue is too small."
Did you also hear me saying,
"Take it to lab and get it analysed, Fontenoy?"
Yes, sir, and I'm doing just that.
No.
No, I couldn't have forgotten anything.
I am as sure the security was on yesterday as I am sure it's off today.
Fontenoy.
Attention, please.
The qualifying rounds will begin in eight minutes.
- Douglas and Applegate.
- Douglas.
Ah, yes, Monsieur Douglas.
You're in the heat after this one.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
That's the same heat
I'm in, Douglas.
And you're going to need more than luck.
You're going to need wings.
Oh, yeah? Well, you may be in for a little surprise.
I can see your surprise.
It is very little.
Attention...
Look for an even bigger surprise when the race starts.
There will be qualifying today and tomorrow, with the top 16 times running in the Trans France race.
You are not in this heat. Come back.
Say, Herbie, where you going?
Herbie, you could get us disqualified.
He could get us killed.
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Forget the music.
Whoa.
He's out of his mind.
He's out of his mind, all right.
Over that luscious little Lancia.
What is...
I'm telling you, Paris and women have got him.
I'm gonna have to warn him the same way I did you.
Like father, like car.
What are you doing?
- Now, wait a minute, buddy...
- What do you mean, "buddy"?
- Miss Buddy.
- You... You...
Yeah, Jim Douglas.
And I'm very sorry.
You think...
That because I'm a woman driver, you can get away with anything you please.
Well, I'm not a pigeon for your fun and games.
I've had it with you clowns.
No, I'm not the clown.
Believe me, it was Herbie.
Oh, yes, you're blaming your dizzy mechanic.
No, no, it's...
Herbie's the car, and he's kinda like a person.
He's... now, I know that sounds funny.
Crazy, is more like it.
Well, what were you doing out there, Douglas?
Well, it's kinda hard to explain, sir...
Not for me, it isn't.
He doesn't want a woman in the race.
Look, Miss Darcy, you'll be given another chance to qualify.
We're terribly sorry.
You're sorry, he's sorry, everybody's sorry.
But I didn't qualify.
Attention, Antonio Vittoro.
If you wish to qualify, Mr. Douglas, you have exactly 10 minutes.
Hear that, Herbie?
You forget that powder puff and get your mind on racing.
You better believe it.
Gilbert.
We're going to cook that chicken, European-style.
When he sticks out his neck,
- we will chop it off.
- Huh. Oui, oui.
Jawohl, jawohl.
We'll see whose neck gets chopped off.
Right, Herbie?
Attention, attention, attention.
You better close your mouth, turkey, because you're gonna get our tire marks right across your teeth.
- Where'd they go?
- I really got snookered.
I'm even rustier than I thought.
Hey. Herbie, what are you doing?
It's her again.
Oh, no.
Well, it took a crowd to do it.
But at least we lost the Lancia.
And not to mention the first qualifying round.
Did you get a hold of Double X?
He wasn't very happy.
Who is? Where is that stupid little car?
Patience, patience...
Oh, excuse me, sir.
There are impressive racing cars here, but I don't seem to see the little Volkswagen.
Ah, you mean the Douglas car. It will be here.
Patience, my friend, patience.
One more person says
"patience" to me, I'll...
We better have it now, because if we don't turn up with that diamond,
Double X is going to mark the spot where we're buried.
Here, here. Don't dig our graves just yet.
Come on, let's grab it.
- Don't tell me, "patience".
- In front of 100 witnesses?
We need a plan.
Attention, everyone. Attention.
We would like to show a film of the route the racing cars will take when they leave Paris.
If someone will catch the lights while I draw the drapes...
I think the gentleman just gave us a plan.
The fine machines you have seen here will be among those testing the gruelling route, stretching through our fair city, twisting through the French Alps...
Back up slowly, as if nothing was the matter.
In the city, the cars will be able to pick up speed...
As they race along the
French countryside.
Only by the challenge that becomes evident...
As we approach the famous French Alps.
It's not here, max. The car's just not here.
Will test the endurance... Of even the sturdiest of cars.
Perhaps we're backing in the wrong direction.
Just keep backing up.
There remains the final dash for Monte Carlo.
And for someone, victory is just a step away.
- Herbie. Excuse me.
- You mean, no Herbie.
Garcon. Garcon.
Garcon.
Excusez moi.
Oui.
- Etes-vous, cuckoo?
- Oui. Cuckoo.
My car. My car. Has anybody seen my car?
- Oh, that was your car?
- Yes, yes. It's gone.
- Yes, it's gone.
- Did you see who took it?
Not exactly, mademoiselle.
Excuse me, I hate to bother you...
You. I should have known I'd see you.
You and trouble go together.
Yeah, okay. Look, we've lost our car...
And I'd just like to know if you'd seen it, by any chance.
Who cares about your silly Volkswagen?
My Lancia has been stolen.
- Stolen?
- Your car?
- And your car.
- Yeah.
- I saw them both.
- Then you saw who stole them.
You would not believe this.
I would not believe this.
- No one would believe this.
- What?
I think they steal each other.
Come on.
Taxi.
Cuckoo.
Cuckoo. Cuckoo. Coo.
Talk about a needle in a haystack.
How are we gonna find 'em?
I don't know. Just keep looking.
My life is riding on that car.
Lady, I got a few things to prove myself.
Where would you take a boyfriend on first night to Paris?
"Boyfriend"?
Don't tell me this is your cute way of making a pass.
If I had romance in mind, would he be along?
Right.
- It's Herbie.
- Herbie. I don't believe this.
Well, it's true.
There's something about that car.
He's got a... He...
Well, we've been through a lot together.
Yeah, well, nothing like this.
Hey. Regardons. Regarde.
Bateaux-Mouches.
Do you think this is something to laugh about?
Forgive me, mademoiselle.
I laugh at the radio.
Two automobiles, they take a ride on the Bateaux-Mouches.
Would you believe such a thing?
Bateaux-Mouches?
Take a left at that bridge.
Maybe I can explain this over dinner tonight.
Maybe not.
I don't know, Herbie. 12 years is a long time.
Hope we can handle it.
Hope I can handle it.
- Well, all taken care of, Jim.
- Yeah?
Had a little talk with Herbie.
Had to straighten him out.
I don't mind having a car that's got a heart, but I will not tolerate a car falling in love with another car.
What did you expect him to fall in love with, the Goodyear blimp?
The Goodyear... Yeah.
Anyway, I said, "Listen Herbie,
"we're here for one thing only.
"And that's to make the biggest comeback
"in racing history.
"So, no women in training camp.
"Just forget that little chick.
"And you can do it.
"Just a matter of mind over metal."
- You expecting company?
- No.
Detective Fontenoy here.
And this is the famous
Inspector Bouchet.
I'm Jim Douglas and this is my partner
Wheely Applegate.
Look, if there's a problem about our car cruising on the Bateaux-Mouches...
Bateaux-Mouches? No, no.
It's about the six million dollar diamond stolen this morning.
Perhaps the most beautiful diamond in all the world.
Fontenoy.
No?
We are questioning everyone who was in the area at the time.
Perhaps you can help us.
Pushing the car won't help me get the cap off.
- Must've rolled.
- Well, pull the hand brake on.
Door's locked.
The window.
Put your hand through the window.
Ooh.
Let me get at it.
I'm gonna hotwire this car.
We'll get the diamond at the garage.
Right.
Well, I'm not waiting.
Car, it's either you... Or me.
Oof.
I suppose you're going to tell me that car started up and drove away by itself.
No, and I'm not going to tell Double X that either.
What's happening?
There's seven cars ahead of us and we're in last place.
That's what's happening.
- Darcy.
- Oui. Qualifying today?
I hope so.
New Herbie? He's not even an old Herbie.
He's not any Herbie at all.
My whole lecture must've fallen on a deaf carburettor.
He doesn't need a lecture.
He needs an old-age pension.
You listen to me, Herbie, and you listen good.
You and I didn't come out of moth balls to be the laughingstock of the continent.
Either get the lead out of your pants right now, or I'm going to ship you back to the states, have you stuffed and hung on a wall in Retirement Village.
Ah.
Ooh. Now you're talking. We got the old Herbie back.
The old Herbie and the new
Herbie, rolled into one.
I'm telling you, it's the old Herbie, and he's doing it for us.
He's not doing it for us.
He's doing it for her.
Okay, so he did it for her.
I never saw anything like that.
- Congratulations, you did it.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Somebody did it.
- Who cares, Wheely?
It's, "Hello, comeback."
In record time for this track.
You shattered Von Stickle's mark.
Congratulations, Douglas.
You have just won the right to taste my dust tomorrow.
And mine, Douglas.
Today, you break my record.
Tomorrow, I will turn your "Hello, comeback" into "Goodbye forever."
Auf wiedersehen.
Couple of charm school dropouts.
Yeah.
Well, one showboat deserves another.
I'll go get him.
Félicitations.
Absolutely amazing.
I knew I had a good car under me, but...
The exact same time as the Douglas car.
- A track record.
- What?
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Oh, thank you for staying off the track.
It's one way I can prove what I can do.
Well, it wasn't exactly you.
You've got a real problem about women in racing, Mr. Douglas.
What is it? We drive too slow... Or too fast?
Oh, I didn't mean that.
It's not you at all, it's your car.
And my car.
Excuse me, I don't want to hear about your car.
No, I have to tell you this.
I know it's gonna be hard to believe, but...
You see, Herbie's not just a car.
I didn't believe it myself at first, but the little guy has actually got a...
He's...
When a car like Herbie comes to Paris, he meets a beautiful Lancia, that is also a car like Herbie, with a, with a...
You know, it's natural that they're gonna fall in...
You're right.
I wouldn't believe it either.
When the men come by from the booby hatch, go quietly.
Just trying to warn you about your car.
Let me warn you about me.
I'm in this race to win, and frankly, I'd like to see...
You and your car disappear entirely.
Oh.
Quincey.
Pull over. We want that car.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna pull over.
Hang on.
Darkness is about to fall upon you.
Amazing.
Whoa.
Hot, hot, hot.
You...
They're still coming.
I think they are trying to kill us.
Mon dieu. Mon die...
I never thought she'd go that far to make us disappear.
Who's that?
That cute little time bomb, Diane.
She set us up to knock us out of the race, just like she said.
Now, wait a minute.
She didn't say that.
Oh, of course not. They never say what they mean.
That's what makes the female of the species deadlier than the male.
You read that some place.
Yes, and I've got a mother, three sisters and two ex-wives to prove it.
They never told me they wanted me out, but every time I came home, the lock was changed.
I don't take that kind of strong-arm stuff from anybody, male or female.
Then somebody better teach this female the rules of the game...
Before the game is over.
If she doesn't know 'em now, she will when I get through with her.
You might as well settle back, Herbie.
Once Jim gets started, nothing can stop him.
Who hired thugs?
I'm just as good as anybody out there on that track.
And I don't need anybody to win my races for me.
We...
That is the trouble with you, all of you.
You don't think a woman can do anything.
Yeah, I know he seems like a quiet sort of guy, but when a fight is inevitable, he never ducks.
"Women are supposed to be nurses
"and secretaries and school teachers."
I've taken that all my life.
I took it from my mother and my father.
And my aunts and my uncles.
But I'm not going to take it from you.
When old Jim gets started,
I hate to get in his way.
He's a regular steamroller.
- Whoa.
- Coward.
I'm a race driver and I can win it on my own.
Oh.
You know, I think you can.
Double X? Yeah.
I'm afraid we-we-we've had another complication.
I'm beginning to think you are the complication.
That...
That item should have been in my hands by now.
Oh, don't worry, sir. It's still in the gas tank.
Then bring me the gas tank.
What are you waiting for?
We've lost them again, sir.
We don't know where they are.
Excuse me. I'm looking for Inspector Bouchet.
Oui, Monsieur.
Impossible.
Are you trying to tell me a couple of simpleminded
Americans...
Ah...
- Disappeared?
- Hold on.
Hope we're not disturbing you, Inspector.
No, gentlemen.
Your timing could not be more perfect.
Good.
I want to thank you for your continued cooperation...
In this matter of the stolen diamond.
Tonight, we're asking for your help.
Somebody's out to get our car.
Ah, that's impossible.
I think they're trying to knock us out of the race.
I was wondering if there's some way, I don't know, we can put the car in protective custody for the night.
That is, if you're not too busy trying to find that diamond.
No, no.
One is just as important as the other, I assure you.
I'll only be a moment.
Oh. I mean...
- We'll wait in the car.
- Good idea.
We wouldn't want anything to happen to it.
Not now.
Hello. The car is here.
Never mind how...
Never mind how.
No, no. It's too risky for me.
I will see to it that the car will be at number 32,
Avenue Mozart within the hour.
Don't get lost on the way.
Your worry is now my worry, gentlemen. Rest easily.
I'll take personal charge of this valuable possession.
- Inspector.
- What is it, Fontenoy?
Off duty or not, sir,
I couldn't sleep, thinking about the diamond...
And how it would be weighing on your mind.
At the moment, Fontenoy,
I have a car weighing on my mind.
Somebody's trying to knock us out of the race.
Well, with your excellent time in the trials, it would not take a master of deduction like Inspector Bouchet...
To see that you have an excellent chance to win.
Which is why I personally will ensure the safety of this automobile.
Now, put your minds at ease.
Get a good night's sleep.
Thank you. You too, Herbie.
A big day tomorrow, pal.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- No, no. Permit me, sir.
- What do you mean?
You have enough responsibility trying to find the diamond.
- I'll look after the car.
- Don't be ridiculous.
What are you doing?
Anything for you and the force.
Get out of the car.
Leave it to me, sir.
I'll keep this little car hidden so no one will find it.
Fontenoy...
My best man.
Huh.
- Good night.
- Good night.
My very best.
We've checked that, sir. It's nowhere.
We've covered the whole city. Now what?
In the morning, before the race, that ridiculous little car will get gasoline.
When it does, you'll be there.
Welcome, everyone, to the inaugural running of the Trans France race.
They're all here: qualifying drivers and cars from the world over, each looking forward, expectantly, for the chance at the magnificent trophy...
And the $20,000 winner-take-all prize.
This promises to be one of the most punishing races ever.
And these drivers know it.
They've no doubt gone through these cars, time after time after time.
And yet, we have them all here, still refining and tuning car after car, each preparing for the gruelling race...
That will test the endurance of man and machine.
I just wish I had a machine to test.
I hope, what's-his-name didn't hide Herbie so well, he can't find him.
I wish you hadn't said that.
I mean, I'm a mechanic.
And a mechanic is nothing without his car.
A million and one details have to be taken care of for a race.
You know me, how I pride myself on being thorough.
My tools. Where's my tools.
Right here.
- I knew that.
- Huh.
Inspector, the race is about to begin. Where's our car?
Believe me, I am as concerned as you are.
But I'm sure Fontenoy will be here.
He's unpredictable, but he's dependable.
What?
Let me check headquarters again.
He'll be here.
You be ready.
Who's that?
He's Double X, you dummy.
Oh, better duck.
Here comes trouble.
Hello.
Hello.
- Look, about last night.
- I know. Me too.
Sorry.
Not about missing me with that vase, I hope.
No, no.
I guess I was a little uptight last night.
Nervous about the race.
Yeah, yeah. Well, I threw a few brick bats myself.
In the wrong direction.
We didn't get off to a flying start, did we?
Herbie and I take a little getting used to.
When you keep including
Herbie like that, you take a lot of getting used to.
By the way, where is... it?
- Well, I...
- Douglas, did you misplace your little car?
Just temporarily.
You should look under a rock or two. You might find it.
No, not under a rock, Gilbert.
Under a gravestone.
Attention, everyone.
All drivers, bring your machines to the grid.
Five minutes 'til race time.
It's just as well, Douglas.
You know the saying,
"They never come back."
- Well, I better go.
- Diane.
Good luck.
I think you mean that.
Drivers will please take your position...
As quickly as possible.
- Well, take the brake off.
- The brake is off.
You know something?
That Lancia's waiting on Herbie.
Well, so are we, and all we need is her hanging around.
All right. Push it, push it.
- No, mademoiselle.
- Listen, I...
I hope you had nothing to do with this.
I didn't, but I think I can tell you who did.
I know, it's your Herbie.
That's right. Herbie's missing and your Lancia's missing Herbie.
You must think I'm an absolute fool with this "Herbie,
Herbie, Herbie."
Well, I don't believe in fairy tales or Herbie or you.
Jim, pop the hood, will ya?
What are you doing?
You want your car started, don't ya?
Listen, I know how you feel, but you better get over it right now.
Forget Herbie.
You know why he isn't here, don't you?
He's found somebody else, that's why.
He didn't have the guts to tell you himself, so I'm telling you.
Oh, yeah, we're talking about the same guy, all right.
Old Herbie. Old fun-loving, fickle, Herbie.
Now you see him, now you don't.
He's right, you know.
So far, we've had to tell this to a Fiat, a Thunderbird and an Austin-Healey.
I know how you feel. It's...
Fun while it lasted, but...
You know, the truth is, you weren't the first and you won't be the last.
You might as well take off.
Will somebody help me start my car?
Yes Miss.
Please. Let me have a look.
Thank you.
No problem.
I was beginning to think everybody around here was crazy.
Well, so much for the Lancia.
Yeah. So much for both of them, I guess.
Douglas, let's go.
Don't you realise you've got pole position?
I also realise we don't have a car.
But it'll be here.
It'd better be. In two minutes, Douglas, or you can try again next year.
Mesdames et monsieurs...
Ladies and gentlemen, the first running of the
Trans France race...
Is about to begin.
What's that?
It's an armoured truck.
That armoured truck is us.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes. Yes.
Where's Herbie? Are you crazy?
We're supposed to be in a race, and here you are guarding the Bank of England...
Or the crown jewels or who knows what.
We didn't travel 6,000 miles just to see some French pastry dressed up like a tin soldier.
I'll tell you something. I've had it with the French...
The men, women and the...
Herbie?
Are we still in it?
From the looks of it, you'll be starting and finishing in last place.
Quickly, you've no time to lose.
You have things to attend to.
- Gas. Let's move it, Wheely.
- Check. Top of my list.
Fill it up.
Monsieur Douglas, stop.
What do you mean, stop?
The tank is full. I filled it this morning.
Let's go, Wheely.
Come on, Herbie. What're you doing? The race is back there.
I know what he's doing.
He can't fool me.
He's looking for that Lancia.
Inspector.
Well, what I was going to say, sir...
Suppose there was a connection between the men who attacked and the men who stole the diamond.
Not now, Fontenoy.
But, sir, what if they've hidden the stolen diamond in the car?
- What?
- If I may suggest, sir, we should have our men search that car immediately.
- Search?
- Yes.
- There is no time.
- The car is still here.
Yes?
Yes, but it is obviously...
Tuning up, or something.
Just say the word, and the men and I...
Will search that car from bumper to bumper.
The word is no, Fontenoy.
No?
What you don't seem to understand is that, a thorough search would take over an hour.
And an hour's delay would deprive Douglas of winning a race...
He has travelled halfway around the globe to enter.
Sir, I admire you for your consideration.
And I understand now exactly how you are thinking.
Sorry, sir.
Forget the Lancia,
Herbie. She's gone.
You heard him right. Gone, split.
Yeah, that's right.
She took off in that race like you never existed.
She wanted me to tell you, it was fun while it lasted, but when push came to shove, she shoved off.
That's just the way women are.
Might as well face it.
You've been deserted, jilted. Abandoned.
Too late now.
We'll get it in Monte
Carlo after the race.
Inspector, I think you will be proud of me.
What now, Fontenoy?
I have done exactly what I knew you would have wanted me to... notified Monte Carlo.
Their police will search the car as soon as it arrives.
I'll take care at once, sir.
Whoa.
Catch anything?
I didn't think so.
- Which way?
- Right.
Left.
Hope they get that trophy to Monte Carlo on a fast jet. We may beat 'em to it.
Unfortunately, somebody put the Alps in our way.
The way Herbie's flying, nothing can stop him, including the Himalayas.
Some road. It's not even on the map.
Maybe you oughta ask directions.
From who, a French mountain goat?
There must be somebody.
Wheely, you...
Maybe I'll just call from in here.
Yeah.
Hey, there's somebody out there.
No, that's just me. I never heard a real echo before.
Will you sit down, Wheely?
Just one more, okay?
Come on, Wheely.
I got somebody.
Those are the guys who were after Herbie.
Get out of the car.
- I'm taking over.
- I'll drive the car.
If it worked once, maybe it'll work again.
Hey, buddy, I like your
"yodel-ay-hee-oo".
Well, we're back on the beam.
How many cars you figure are ahead of us?
Would you believe all of 'em?
Is that a knocking I hear in the gas tank?
Not in my gas tank. Never.
Sounds like something clunking around in there.
Well, we either listen to the driver...
And stop to take the gas tank apart, or we listen to the mechanic and try to win this race.
Well, I'm listening to the mechanic.
Let's go, Herbie.
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
The oil pressure's up, there's plenty of gas.
But he's not getting it.
I hate to mention this again, but I heard some clunking...
You mean that nonsense about the gas tank again?
Yeah, that's...
All right, let's get it straight, once and for all, who the mechanic is around here, okay?
You say it's the gas tank, and I say it isn't the gas tank.
You see? It isn't the gas tank.
It's this... Rock that was in the gas tank.
Hold it.
There's only one kind of rock that glistens like that.
Well, sure, quartz.
You can find millions of 'em around any quarry in Philly.
But... Not one that's worth...
Six million bucks.
- Huh?
- L'etoile de Joie.
The tall, the what?
Etoile de Joie.
Oh, wow.
That's...
That's the biggest hunk of diamond
I've ever seen in my life.
What I don't understand is how it...
The black sedan.
- Huh? Where?
- No, no, no.
They're the ones that robbed the museum.
Don't you see?
They weren't trying to knock us out of the race.
They were trying to get this.
Thank you for helping us, gentlemen, and up with your hands.
You gave us the slip for the last time.
We'll take the rock.
I don't suppose you'd believe that was just a big hunk of quartz.
The rock. Let me have it.
Ha-ha-ha.
The rock. Well, come on, hand it over.
Oh. Oh.
Ooh. Ooh.
Well, what do we do with them now?
Thanks, Herbie. We tie 'em up.
Double X, we lost them.
First time we've ever been done in by a car.
The goods will be in Monte Carlo in a couple of hours.
No chance of stopping them.
See, we... We're rather tied up at the moment.
Get me the airport.
We passed every car on the road.
All except the Lancia.
Well, after the way she jilted Herbie, that's one car he won't wanna come in second to.
Right, Herbie?
Hey, isn't that it?
It sure is.
Maybe we should've stopped.
Stop? Are you kidding?
Throw away 100 grand and the biggest comeback of our lives?
We've got this thing.
We're a shoe-in.
- She's in trouble.
- Well, sure, plenty of cars get in trouble.
Let the rescue boys bail her out.
Yeah, but I mean, she could be in real danger.
I'm sorry, Wheely.
Sometimes a comeback comes second.
Herbie doesn't seem to think so.
Well, yeah, sure. Why should
Herbie want to stop...
After the lies you told him back there?
Yeah, the jilted lover.
Why, if he knew that that little Lancia...
Had been waiting on him at the starting line, wouldn't even budge...
Until you lied to her about him throwing her over...
I mean, she... Why, he'd...
I mean, he'd be back at her side right now.
I hate to say this, Jim, but you got a big mouth. You know that?
Hang on, Diane.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You okay?
I think so. I missed a shift and lost control.
That's not all you could've lost.
Herbie, what're you doing?
Herbie, there's no time.
Forget it, Wheely.
He's gonna get his girlfriend out of the mud.
And us out of the race.
I see it, but I don't believe it.
Well, you can believe this, we are now out of the money, because "Sometimes a comeback comes second."
Who's giving up, buddy? Not me.
- Come on, you come with us.
- No, no, I...
I'm gonna stay with my car.
Looks like we're all gonna stay with her car.
Let's go, Wheely.
You're not going any place, are you?
Herbie?
Now listen to me.
Herbie, I know just how you feel, but I also know you're not a quitter.
Now show 'em you can do it, Herbie.
Win it for them.
And for her.
Oh, hey.
The rest is up to you.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
Aw, come on, Herbie.
Open up, will ya? Come on.
I know you're sore about what I told you, but I'm sorry, okay?
Look, I did it for you.
Okay, okay, I did it for us.
What do you want me to do, get down on my knees?
Okay.
All right, I lied to ya, and I'm sorry.
And I promise I'll never, never do it again, okay?
Boy, you sure don't forgive easy, do ya?
Bouchet, did you miss a turn on your way to the Eiffel Tower?
No. A little unfinished business, Emile.
You've wounded me, my friend.
You think I cannot handle a little diamond search?
Five of my best men are waiting for the cars to enter Monte Carlo.
- That is exactly why I'm here.
- A-ha.
Afraid I will steal some of your glory?
There is no glory to be stolen.
I wish to rectify a terrible mistake...
And save everyone from embarrassment.
- The search is off.
- Off?
The message was an error by another zealous young detective, anxious to make an overnight reputation for himself.
Ah, yes, but for this kind of news they invented the telephone.
Ooh-la-la.
This is a matter that needed my personal attention.
Who knows what complications could arise from a situation like this?
This is a big race.
It could cause... An international incident.
Ah.
Well, it, seems your young man in Paris...
Has caused you a lot of trouble.
I assure you, Emile,
I intend to put an end to it.
Wiser heads are always called upon to clean up the mistakes of the young.
- It's true.
- And our reward, we get it when we reach heaven.
Perhaps a bit sooner.
Three down and two to go.
Dirty road hog.
Why doesn't he learn how to drive?
He knows how to drive.
That's the trouble.
Yeah, I see what you mean.
If we don't get him by the tunnel...
There's no way we can pass him.
Bruno was right. They never come back.
Herbie.
Ha-ha. I don't b... believe it.
We did it.
They don't come back, huh?
I guess Herbie wasn't listening.
- Whoo.
- Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo.
Ha-ha.
Swine.
Herbie. Herbie.
Herbie. Herbie.
Herbie. Herbie.
How does it feel to be back in the winner's circle?
Pretty good.
Well, for the 20th time, it was a great race, and we enjoyed every minute of it...
Almost every minute of it.
Well, I'm enjoying every minute of this,
I can tell you that.
And, both of us would like to thank you all very, very much.
Au revoir. Arrivederci.
Ciao. Buenas noches.
Sayonara.
Right. See ya around, Douglas.
Hey, that's some cute little memento you got there, old buddy.
Well, this little memento's as much yours as mine, old buddy.
And it's more Herbie's than anybody's.
You can say that again.
Well, look who's here.
May I add my congratulations.
You'll congratulate us even more when you see what we've got for ya.
It was right in Herbie's gas tank.
Ah.
This whatcha been looking for?
Yes.
It's had a rough trip, hasn't it?
But it's winding up in the right hands.
Indeed, it is.
Don't know how we missed connections, sir, but here I am.
Fontenoy.
You see? I knew the diamond would be found.
It's an honour to be at your side in this moment of triumph, Inspector.
And I have more good news, sir.
The two thieves have been captured.
Good.
Good. Then I'd say the case is concluded.
Yeah.
But, you know, there seems there'd be a mastermind behind this kind of thing.
Yeah, or that museum has some pretty lousy security.
Sir, men have been challenged to a duel for such an accusation.
The museum's security was virtually foolproof.
I made an interesting discovery just today, sir.
- Fontenoy...
- From the sensitised floor... to the radar beam surrounding the pedestal to the very pillow on which the diamond rested, all the traps were conceived and executed by one man.
- Fontenoy.
- No, sir.
Give credit where credit is due.
The combinations to the entire security system were devised and known only to you.
The only question is, who besides the inspector knew the details of these precautions?
Who besides the Inspector?
The answer to that question is...
Nobody.
My retirement has been delayed too long.
Now I hope no one will be foolish enough to make a move.
Move this ridiculous car, or
I'll be forced to kill you.
Ah.
Even a mastermind can be outsmarted by this car.
Thanks, Herbie.
Inspector.
I always hoped you'd be present when I cracked my first big case, sir.
Fontenoy.
Excuse me, sir.
Sorry, sir. Sorry.
I think you'll find it's all here, Monsieur.
I'm so happy.
I personally will see to it that this magnificent automobile receives the greatest honour France can bestow.
Please, the, VW?
VW.
Yes, the VW. The white one with the 53 on the side.
Yes, yes, I know the car.
It is the toast of all Monte Carlo.
Yes. It's also our transportation, if you wouldn't mind.
Oh, I wouldn't mind, Monsieur, but it is no longer here.
What?
It was stolen.
Mademoiselle, you would not believe this.
I would not believe this.
No one would believe this.
It was stolen...
By another car.
I know that you believe about Herbie, but you're probably not ready to believe...
Giselle can do anything she wants to.
Giselle?
We're strong women, she and I.
Shall we make it a foursome?
Let's go.
Take us to ze most romantic spot in Monte Carlo.
Well...
Yeah, being chief mechanic is important, but I didn't exactly win the race all by myself.
No?
Well, almost.

You there, which way to Pepperinge Eye?
Couldn't say, sir. lt said on the wireless to paint out the signposts in case the Nazis drop in. l'm not a Nazi! l'm a British officer!
That's what you'd say if you was a Nazi, isn't it, sir?
Drive on, corporal.
Sorry to give you so many but you do have six bedrooms.
No trouble.
Anything to get the poor things away from those terrible bombings in London.
What about us?
- Oh, yes. What is your name?
- Rawlins, ma'am.
Oh, yes. Here we are. Carrie.
Charles.
Paul.
You're for Miss Price. l'm expecting her in.
- Call out the navy
- l won't be a moment.
Please don't touch anything.
Call out the tanks
From the Cliffs of Dover,
call up the gulls
And don't forget
the loyal territorials
But who's digging in here?
Who will defend
Every inch of England,
no matter what they send?
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,
that's who
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard
We wrote the story
of the old brigades
We know the glory
of yesterday's parades
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?

- Halt!
- Carry on, sergeant.
Captain Greer, sir, from headquarters at Tidbury, here to check military preparations.
Tell them Pepperinge Eye has matters well in hand.
Nevertheless, l...
What on earth is that?
Good morning, General. l received your message, Mrs Hobday.
- l assume my parcel has arrived.
- lt's in the office.
How lovely.
- Who is that?
- Miss Price. Splendid woman.
Her late father served with me.
What does she burn in this? lt smells like sulphur.
Ridiculous! One can't make motor fuel out of sulphur!
Here we are. Another object from
Professor Emelius Browne in London.
- Thank you.
- ls it what you expected?
- l imagine so.
- He sent you a cat last time.
- Professor Browne is well?
- l haven't the faintest idea.
Are we to have the pleasure of meeting him? l doubt it. l don't know
Professor Browne personally.
- Was there something else?
- Yes. Would you come this way?
- l'm very anxious to get home.
- Come along, please.
- Get down, Charlie. l want a ride!
- Bash him one!
Stop it this instant!
Children, this is Miss Price.
Carrie, Charles and Paul Rawlins, all the way from London.
- How do you do?
- How are you, miss?
The government are trying to evacuate children into the country.
- Very sensible.
- Today they sent us 45.
And l've had to find homes for all of them at very short notice.
These are the last three. All right, children. Pick up your things.
You're not suggesting l take these children into my house?
- Exactly.
- That's quite out of the question.
Children and l don't get on. l'll believe you, miss.
Come on. Back to London.
Be quiet.
Besides, l have important work to do.
Miss Price, you do have that entire house to yourself.
According to the Ministry of
Civil Defence, you have no choice. l see. lf that is the case l shall take them into my house, with the understanding that you find another home as soon as possible.
Fine. Come along.
Good morning, Miss Price.
There they are!
Oh, Miss Price, what a charitable thing you are doing, taking in these poor unfortunates from the city.
- Hold this very carefully.
- l wonder if l may drop by later.
- Why?
- Consider their spiritual needs.
That won't be necessary.
They won't be with me for long.
My parcel, please.
Bring your things inside.
- Bit murky, ain't it?
- Yeah.
Not another house round here for miles.
- Wipe your feet.
- Big place, this.
- Who else lives here?
- l live alone. lt suits my purpose.
All right. Come along, everybody.
Sorry, miss. The cat startled us.
No need for alarm.
You just frightened him.
Yeah, he's scared to death.
You can see that!
- What do you call your cat?
- l don't give animals silly names. l call him Cosmic Creepers because that's the name he came with.
You will sleep in here.
This was my father's bedroom.
Be very careful of everything in it.
- You boys take the bed there.
- All right, miss.
- What was your name?
- Carrie, miss.
- You sleep in the sofa in there.
- Thank you, miss.
- ls that all you brought?
- We ain't exactly burdened down.
Travel light, that's us. l don't think this is going to work but it seems that l have no alternative.
We'll do our best, miss.
Really, we will.
Thank you, Carrie.
The bathroom is along the landing.
- Supper is at 6:00. You will wash...
- Wash?
You will wash yourselves otherwise there will be no supper. ls that clear?
A house of horror.
That's what we've come to.
Please don't bother to whisper. l'm exceptionally keen of hearing.
You are planning to run back to London.
Please do your plotting elsewhere where l shan't have to listen to it. l don't know much about what children eat.
You'll have to make do as l do. ls there anything in particular that you fancy?
Sausage and mash, bubble and squeak, toad in the hole, fried fish...
Anything at all.
You won't find any fried foods in this house.
- No fried food?
- No.
How do you keep your health?
Cabbage buds, rosehips, hyssop seed, elm bark, wattle yeast and stewed nettles.
''Dear Madam. With this shipment, the Emelius Browne
College of Witchcraft sends you its congratulations on qualifying for the first degree of your chosen calling.''
''You may now call yourself
'apprentice witch'.''
''Yours faithfully, Emelius Browne.''
My first broom.
Time to go. Everybody up.
Wake up, Paul.
We're going back to London.
Let's see how we fly this thing.
Here we are.
''Clasp the broom with both hands.''
Yes, of course.
''Never astride the broom.''
Oh, yes, of course.
''A witch is always a lady unless circumstances dictate otherwise.''
''Take an easy, graceful sideways position.''
Of course, that's much better.
An easy, graceful sideways position.
There we are. How's that?
''To start up the broom, your basic formula:
La kipo necriff scrumpet leech!'' l wasn't ready!
Now watch this.
Here we go. lt's going to be a little different this time.
All right. l know it's not ladylike.
What's the matter?
- How does she do that?
- She's a witch.
That's the sort of thing witches do.
She don't fly good, do she?
- She's crashed!
- Now's our chance to hop it!
- Suppose she's hurt.
- Go on! You can't hurt a witch.
Look out!
She's proper cross now.
Let's get away from here.
Hang on. l'm having a bit of a think.
A witch she is, says you.
Then let's use the old loaf, says l.
- Let's get back to London.
- What we have here is an opportunity.
She don't want anyone to know she's a witch, does she?
- Not ruddy likely.
- That's the opportunity.
And l intend to make the most of it. Come on.
- Bran porridge.
- Thank you, miss.
Very healthful, l'm sure!
- Hurt your foot, Miss Price?
- Just twisted my ankle.
- Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you. lt's nothing serious.
Lovely weather for flying last night.
Why did you say that, Charles?
Game's up, Miss Price.
We know what you are. l see.
Don't worry, Miss Price.
No one's gonna peach on you.
Thank you. l should be most grateful if you didn't tell anyone.
Course there would have to be one or two little changes made round here. l mean, l'd like to see an occasional sausage on the table here.
- A bit of strawberry jam.
- Charlie!
Let me handle this.
And another thing, Miss Price.
There will be no more of this wash, wash, wash, morning and night.
Anything else?
Now you mention it, l could do with a bit of lolly.
Lolly?
Cash. Cold, hard cash.
You must have buckets of it.
The most accomplished of witches can't make money out of thin air.
Have you ever heard of a rich witch?
Be that as it may, you don't want us to blab, do you?
Have you considered what danger you might be in? l am a witch, you know.
What will you do?
Turn me into a toad?
Lovely. A toad with pink eyes.
- l might just do that.
- Go on, then. l dare you.
Very well, Charles.
- You shouldn't have said that to her.
- She don't frighten me.
She can't even ride a proper broom.
Excuse me, Charles.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Oh, Charlie!
That's better than a toad!
That's a rabbit!
Bother! l never seem to be able to manage toads.
Stop! Leave him alone!
- Don't let Charlie get hurt.
- My spells don't last very long. l'm just an apprentice witch.
Look out, Charlie!
You flaming brute! l'll teach you to do that to me!
Let Cosmic Creepers alone.
Weren't his fault. l'm afraid it's my fault.
Bad enough not being able to manage a broom. l can't perform a simple, basic spell.
You dared her to do it. l don't see why we can't all be friends.
Maybe she's not a wicked witch.
Of course l'm not!
- See?
- lf only l could trust you.
You see, the work l'm doing is so important to the war effort.
- How do you mean?
- l mean exceptionally important.
Most secret.
What do you say, Charlie?
We can keep a secret.
Yeah. lf someone made it worth our while. l don't follow.
Simple. You give us something valuable to seal the pact.
Oh, Charlie, don't try to be clever again. lt's for our own protection, ain't it? lf we broke the pact, we'd have to give back the valuable object. l think it's an excellent idea. l wonder what l could give you.
Would you settle for one of my spells?
Bet that's not worth much.
Come with me.
- l like you better as a rabbit.
- Shut up, you.
Well, l never had a rabbit.
Careful what you touch in here.
Rum sort of place, ain't it?
When l signed for my witchcraft course there was a free bonus, a marvellous travelling spell if you paid in advance. l think l'll give you that one.
- ls it valuable?
- Certainly.
Poisoned dragon's liver?
You mean you poison the dragon or just the liver? lt comes prepared. lt's part of the school equipment.
Here we are. The travelling spell.
Everybody gather round.
All right now. Let's see.
Does any one of you have a bracelet or a ring?
- Something that you can twist.
- No, Miss Price.
- What about you, Paul?
- Always carry a few things around.
Never know when they might come in useful. Piece of blue glass.
Lovely bit of string.
Horseshoe nail.
What's that?
Knob from the bed upstairs.
- lt twists, don't it?
- Yeah. Twisted right off.
Yes, l think that will be all right.
Carrie, turn the light down a little bit, will you?
Hellebore, henbane, aconite... glow-worm fire, firefly light!
There. lsn't that pretty? ls that all we get?
This knob will now work the famous travelling spell.
And what's the famous travelling spell?
- How does it work?
- You take this knob and put it back on the bed upstairs.
Then turn it smartly a quarter turn to the left then in a firm, clear voice, tell it where you want to go and the bed will take you there.
Go on!
- Will it really?
- l see no reason to think otherwise.
Thank you for the lovely gift.
Sorry, but it belongs to Paul. He's the only one who can work the spell.
- Me?
- Yes.
That's right. My knob, weren't it?
That's the way the spell works.
Nice mess he'll make of things.
Oh, bother.
You children run upstairs.
Don't try anything with the bedknob till l get back.
''Dear Madam, it grieves me to inform you that we have been forced to close down our College of Witchcraft.''
''This means that we shall not be sending you the final lesson in which you expressed so much interest.''
- What's keeping you?
- l've had some very bad news. ls there anything we can do?
No. No, thank you.
Yes.
Yes, there is something that Paul can do.
- Me?
- l need the bedknob back.
- l must get to London.
- No. l want to go to the jungle.
Come with me, Paul.
Now, Paul.
Ridiculous as it may seem to have to explain this to a six-year-old,
- l do need your help.
- Go ahead. l was expecting a very important spell in the mail from my teacher, Professor Emelius
Browne, and it hasn't come.
What's that got to do with my knob? l must go to London immediately and see Professor Browne.
With his help, we may be able to bring this war to a successful end.
That is why l need the knob.
What is your decision?
Thank you, Paul. l brought this for your hair. lt may be windy.
Thank you. lt's ever so nice.
Paul, have you been to the bathroom?
- Twice.
- Good.
Charles, put on something warmer.
The bed may travel quite fast. l'm not going. l'm staying right here.
But why?
All that rubbish about a travelling bed. lt won't work. That's why.
Carrie, help me to pull the bed out.
We don't want to scratch the wall when we take off.
How's a ruddy big bed like that gonna get out of this room with those little windows? l don't know. There's a great many things about magic that l don't know.
- We'll just have to find out.
- Lovely!
Just leave me out of it. l don't fancy making a fool of myself.
What's come over you lately, Charlie?
You're no fun any more.
Help me tidy up. We don't want to go to London with an unmade bed.
- How old is Charles?
- Eleven, going on twelve. l see. That's what my father used to call the age of not believing.
What's that supposed to be?
When you rush around
in hopeless circles
Searching everywhere
for something true
You're at the age of not believing
When all the make-believe
is through
That's Charlie to a tee.
When you set aside
your childhood heroes
And your dreams are lost
upon a shelf
You're at the age of not believing
And worst of all you doubt yourself
Throw that away.
You're a castaway
where no one hears you
On a barren isle in a lonely sea
What's that? Poetry?
Where did all the happy endings go?
Where can all the good times be?
Everyone on the bed who's going.
You must face the age
of not believing
Doubting everything you ever knew
The knob.
Until at last you start believing
There's something wonderful in you
Lovely sentiment, l'm sure.
- Are you ready, Paul?
- Yes, Miss Price.
Repeat after me.
Take us to
Professor Emelius Browne...
Very good.
Headmaster, Correspondence
College of Witchcraft.
..of Witchcraft, London.
When l say go, tap the knob three times and turn it a quarter turn to the left.
- Left...
- That's it.
We'd better hold on tight.
The behaviour of the bed is something l'm not sure of.
Let me breathe a little.
All right, Paul. Ready? Go.
One... two... three...
- ls this London?
- Course it is!
- Smell that lovely sooty air.
- Marvellous, ain't it?
- Charles, are you convinced?
- Not yet l ain't. l don't see no Professor Browne.
Neither do l.
You children look after the bed while l make enquiries for Mr Browne.
- l told you this bed wouldn't work.
- Don't start that again. lt didn't work. lt was supposed to take us to Professor Browne.
- ''Professor Browne.''
- Come on!
Ladies and gentlemen, gather round, please.
Please note the name:
Professor Emelius Browne. l am here to divert, to amuse, and, yes, even to help you.
- There he is!
- lt is not what things are... lt is what they seem to be. ls that not so?
That ain't the kind of professor l expected. l'm not sure it's the kind
Miss Price expected, either.
What effect a little smoke is... with a dash of hocus-pocus and the scent of burning... and the scent of burning sulphur in the air.
And now, for my next trick, may l draw your attention to this solid piece of ordinary window glass, framed in an ordinary unprepared frame.
May l also draw your attention to this perfectly ordinary steel nail.
Now l shall place the framed glass in this brown, unprepared...
Unprepared, mark you...
Unprepared brown paper bag. l shall now attempt to drive the steel nail through the glass without breaking the glass.
''lmpossible!'' l hear you say.
We shall see.
He ain't very good, even if he is a professor. l tell you what l'm going to do.
No, please don't go.
Don't leave now and regret lost opportunities later.
You, young sir. Would you care to warble like the storied nightingale?
With this inexpensive device, you can charm the very birds down from the trees, like so.
- How much?
- For you, sir, one penny.
One copper coin of the realm.
Carrie, l'm very surprised at you wandering off like this.
We found him for you, miss.
We found Professor Browne.
Don't work. l've been cheated! ls that Professor Browne? lt is indeed, my dear.
How may l serve you?
Would you be interested in the mating call of the Brazilian bird of love?
Very useful, eh?
You are the headmaster of the
Emelius Browne College of Witchcraft?
The late headmaster.
The college, alas, is now defunct.
Professor Browne, l am one of your pupils.
My dear lady, you are indeed an ornament to the college.
- Splendid.
- Not at all. l was shocked when you closed down the college without that most important last lesson. l'm sorry, my dear. No refunds.
Look at your contract.
But l must have the spell that comes with the last lesson!
The matter is closed. l bid you good day. l have an appointment at my club.
The matter is not closed!
- Don't let him get away.
- Righto!
Here we are.
Will you get this child off my leg?
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Now l trust you'll behave more like a gentleman.
Look out!
There goes another rabbit.
What was all that about? l changed you into a rabbit with one of your own spells.
My spell? From my school?
Not one of your best spells. lt doesn't last.
Some of your others are much better.
But l don't understand. My spell?
They were just nonsense words from an old book.
They worked perfectly well for me.
They work for you?
Good woman! Some kind of destiny has brought us together.
You got these spells out of some old book, you say? l changed them round a bit. l gave them a bit of my own style, as it were.
The old sorcerers did have a bit of a tendency to waffle on.
But dear lady, l never thought l'd meet somebody like you.
What a treasure.
Mr Browne, will you please stick to the point. l would like to see this book immediately.
Certainly. lt's at my new town house.
Would you care to join me for luncheon?
We can discuss my ideas at the same time.
Thank you. We'd be delighted.
We shall all go together.
- On the bed?
- On the bed, Paul. Come along.
You go round the other side. l always travel on the left.
Will you give the address to Paul, please?
May l ask how we are going to get there on this bed? Fly?
My dear Professor, with your own travelling spell.
The one you gave with the course as a bonus.
My travelling spell?
That works as well?
Just give the address, please.
8 Winchfield Road.
Bed, take us to 8 Winchfield Road.
Madam, is this vehicle safe?
Perfectly. A bit theatrical, perhaps, but then most good spells are.
We're here. l would never have believed it.
You must have given us the wrong address. Do you live here? ln fact, l do.
Temporarily, at any rate. l found the front door open.
The house was deserted.
Everyone has left the neighbourhood.
Why should they do that?
This probably has something to do with it.
Merciful heavens!
You should be terrified at the very idea of living here.
You would have thought so. l am by nature a little bit of a coward.
But then l pondered. ln the perverse nature of things, this diabolical object is probably the best friend l've ever had. lt enables me, for the first time in my life, to live like a king.
Shall we go in?
Rothschild '26. Noble, worldly-wise, but with a charming touch of innocence.
Mr Browne, the book. Where is it?
Dear lady, you are relentless.
The book is in the library. We shall proceed there after our cheese and wine.
Why do you keep the curtains closed?
So that we may enjoy the gentle glow of candle light.
More likely so's a copper don't peek in and catch you hiding out here.
Why don't you have a look round the house?
- l want to chat with Miss Price.
- May we?
Yes, run along.
But don't touch anything.
Remember, this house does not belong to Mr Browne.
Mr Browne, where is that book? l must have that spell on substitutiary locomotion.
- What is it? A toy shop?
- No, it's a nursery.
- Ain't you ever seen a nursery?
- No. And neither have you.
Would you hold this, please?
What do you think of that?
- Well, l... don't know what to think.
- Miss Price.
Think how successful l could be with an assistant who can really do magic.
Dear lady, have you ever considered entering show business?
- The what business?
- The theatre!
Pantomimes, village fairs, the seaside.
Brighton, Blackpool, follies on the prom. l have very important work to do.
Listen to me. We could make a packet.
Let us strike a bargain
You possess a gift
But I can speak the jargon
That will give your gift
the needed lift
You possess the know-how
And I command the show-how
Oh, how successful you could be
With me l'm afraid we're wasting valuable time.
- What's your name?
- Miss Price.
- Your first name.
- Eglantine.
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh, how you'll shine
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours
As the shine sells the boot
and the blossoms the fruit
All you need to succeed
in your plan
Is the proper ally
upon whom to rely
And I'm your man
For I have an acumen
that's nigh-superhuman
I sell things that nobody can
So I humbly suggest
you accept my behest
I'm your man
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh how you'll shine
Will you stop?
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours
What are you reading?
''lsle of Naboombu.''
- Can't be no such place.
- There is too such a place.
These pictures prove it, don't it?
Bit weird, ain't it?
Animals wearing hats and things. l like it.
Now where is the book?
Well? Where is it?
At last, Mr Browne!
''The Spells of Astoroth.''
Of course.
Here's the travelling spell.
This is where you got it.
Does one's nose have to twitch like this?
Oh, you're back, Mr Browne.
Miss Price, a word about your tactics. l don't mind being changed into a hawk or a tiger or something with dash.
But always a fluffy white rabbit? lt's intolerable!
Here we are!
Substitutiary locomotion.
''The ancient art of...''
''The spell which creates this force is five mystic words.''
''These words are...''
But the rest of the book is missing!
Now you see why l closed down the college.
- But where are the other pages?
- Haven't the foggiest.
- Listen to me!
- l'm all ears.
You will be if you don't pay attention.
Where did you get this book? l bought it from a street market.
There was a bit of unpleasantness.
He claimed that l'd given him a dud coin. l ask you!
There was a sort of scuffle.
The book tore.
He got one half and l got the other.
- But where's the other half now?
- lt's probably been thrown away.
But if it still exists, there's only one place to find it.
- Where is that?
- Portobello Road
Portobello Road
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed
Anything and everything
a chap can unload
Is sold off the barrow
in Portobello Road
You'll find what you want
in the Portobello Road
- Rare alabaster
- Genuine plaster
A filigreed samovar
owned by the tsars
- A pen used by Shelley
- A new Botticelli!
The snippers that clipped
old King Edward's cigars
Made in Hong Kong?
Two bob a dozen, would you say?
- Waterford crystal
- Napoleon's pistols
Society heirlooms with genuine gems
Rembrandts, El Grecos,
Toulouse-Lautrecos
Painted last week

Very interesting, but where do they sell books?
There's a little place around the corner.
Portobello Road, Portobello Road

You meet all your chums
in the Portobello Road
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.
What l want is the other half of this book.
All in good time, my dear.
Burke's Peerage, The Bride Book,

Dented and tarnished,
scarred and unvarnished
In old Portobello...
This lady is looking for the other half of this book. lt's called ''The Spells of Astoroth''. l don't keep no torn or damaged books here.
What do you think l am?
A ruddy wastepaper merchant?
You can eat like a king
in the Portobello Road
There's another bookstore along here somewhere.
You don't expect to sell a piano like that, do you?
Let me have a go, my dear fellow.
Portobello Road, Portobello Road
Happy things are happening
in Portobello Road
You feel like a ballerina
when you're hopping like a toad
When you kick your heels up
down in Portobello Road
Come on, ducks!
Come on, girls!
Lovely.
Oh, yeah, play the drums.
Closing time!
Bye!

Hey, governor. Something for the lady friend? Nylons?
- No, thank you.
- Petrol coupons?
- Chocs for the little 'uns?
- No.
How about one of these, mate?
Fell off the back of a lorry.
- Be a good chap and run away.
- Would you fancy this, then?
Now you have my undivided attention.
- What can l do for you?
- Get over to the Bookman right away.
He wants to see you. You too.
Who is the Bookman? And what right has he got to order me about? l think we'd better ask questions later.
Excuse me.
Sorry, guv.
No one told me about the stairs.
Why didn't you bring Scotland Yard, Swinburne, and half the Household Cavalry as well?
What's the bed for? lt's a present for you.
That's what he said.
Nothing of the sort.
The bed belongs to me.
Except for this knob, which is mine.
Bookman, there's been bad blood between us long enough.
Let this gift begin friendship anew.
- Draw the curtains. Lock the door.
- You'll be snug as a bug. lsn't that the section of the manuscript we've been looking for?
- Who is this person?
- Miss Eglantine Price.
A charming young woman of my acquaintance.
Miss Price, l've been looking for this other bit a long time.
Mr Swinburne told me you were in the market making enquiries.
And here we are. l don't mind saying, to see it all together at last...
- There isn't much l wouldn't do.
- Or haven't done, for that matter.
- Right, guv?
- You'll close your mouth, Swinburne. ls that clear? lt's all like a jolly detective story or jigsaw puzzle, isn't it?
We're both after the same spell.
You have one clue, l have the other.
Yes, in that case, the sensible thing seems to be for us to cooperate. l assume you're looking for the same thing l am.
May l?
This is quite a moment for both of us.
''Substitutiary locomotion, the lost miracle of the ancients.''
And so on and so forth.
Here we are.
''The spell which creates this force is five mystic words.''
''These words are... engraved on the star that was always worn by the sorcerer Astoroth.''
But where are the words of the spell? l assumed they'd be in your half of the manuscript. l thought they'd be in yours!
Once again, a dead end. l shall never know the secret. lsn't that old Astoroth?
And there's his star.
Pity it's so small you can't read the writing.
- But why the animals?
- Towards the end of his life,
Astoroth kept animals in cages in search for the spells that would make them more like humans.
The legend is that finally the animals rebelled at the experiment, killed Astoroth and stole many of his powers. lncluding the star with the spell on it.
Possibly.
They found a ship, sailed away and were never heard of again.
However, there is a final notation in my half of the book saying that in the 1 7th century a shipwrecked lascar was taken from the sea half mad with thirst and exposure to the sun.
Before he died, he swore he had seen an island ruled by animals.
Where?
There is, l regret to say, no such island. l looked for it in every chart.
The lsle of Naboombu does not exist. lt does too! Got my own...
- What is he trying to say?
- Nothing!
When he don't say nothing, he mumbles. l wish the child to speak!
- Now you've done it.
- There is too such a place.
Got my own book. There.
Real pretty letters, ain't it?
- Let me see it.
- You're not interested, Bookman.
- lt's just a children's book.
- l'll be the judge of that.
- Give it to me.
- No.
Please don't annoy me.
- Give me the book, boy.
- Not likely.
Bit of a stalemate, isn't it? lf it's all the same to you, l'd rather use my own.
Sentiment, you know.
Come along, Paul. lt's time to go.
Go? How, my dear? The door is locked.
Observe the fundamental weakness of the criminal mind.
- You will believe no one or anything.
- l understand.
- The knob, Paul.
- Course you do, my dear.
We can tell them the complete truth.
They will believe nothing.
He's up to something, you know.
Before your very eyes, l shall cause this bed and the occupants on it to disappear. l should like to see a cheap-jack tenth-rate entertainer do a trick like that.
''Cheap-jack entertainer.''
- That was naughty.
- All right, Paul.
- Where to?
- To the lsland of Naboombu.
- l'm very curious about that place.
- Good.
Bed, take us to the lsland of Naboombu.
Enough of this nonsense!
Get the book!
Beastly climate. l never did fancy the sea.
- Where are we?
- Naboombu, of course. l've never seen no island like this before. l'm afraid we may have fallen into the lagoon.
That's right.
Here we are on page three.
Oi, Mr Codfish!
Hello, young fellow!
Welcome to Naboombu Lagoon.
Now l'm hearing things.
Fish don't talk.
Not too bright, is he?
- He's my brother.
- Oh? Sorry.
Mr Codfish, where is the lsland of Naboombu?
You mean the land part? Oh, that.
Straight up. You can't miss it.
None of my business, of course, but l shouldn't go there if l were you.
- Having troubles, they are.
- Troubles?
He's right, you know.
A lot of trouble.
Trouble or not, we should be getting along.
- l wish to see who is in charge.
- What's the rush? lt's really rather splendid down here. For you, my dear.
Thank you.
How pleasant...
Bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What a chance to get a better peep
At the plants and creatures
of the deep
We glide
Far below the rolling tide
Serene
Through the bubbly blue and green
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What if the octopus,
the flounder and the cod
Think we're rather odd?
It's fun to promenade
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
Look!
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
What a chance to get a better peep
At the plants
and creatures of the deep
It's grand
When you're dancing on the sand
Each glance
Bubbles over with romance
It's lovely bobbing along
Bobbing along through the water
Where we get along swimmingly
Far from the frenzy
of the frantic world above
- Two beneath the blue
- Could even fall in love
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea
Bobbing along, singing a song
On the bottom of the beautiful briny,
shimmery shiny
Beautiful briny sea
Bravo!
Most exciting, most exciting.
You've won the ruddy cup.
Help!
This time l really caught a whopper!
People! Oh, no!
What scurvy luck.
- My goodness!
- l'll deal with this, my dear.
- Don't you know that...
- Good day, captain. l used to be a bit of a seafaring man myself.
Many's the time l've shipped out of Portsmouth.
Delighted to meet a fellow mariner.
Now stow it, mate.
- Oh, really!
- Can't you read reading? lt says... ''No peopling allowed.''
- Ridiculous!
- Don't antagonise him, Mr Browne.
That means l've got to throw you all back. That's what to do.
Wait it minute! lt says here that anybody can see the king.
- And that's the law.
- Where do it say that?
Here in my book.
So it do.
But if you people knew what was good for you, you'd get yourselves all throwed back.
The king don't like people!
Nonetheless, we must see the king on an urgent personal matter.
Please lead the way.
But just don't say l didn't warn you. See?
Follow me.
Get out of here!
Yes. What can l do for you? l caught some people down at the sea lagoon.
They want to see the king.
Really? Well, we can't be bothered with that sort of thing now, can we? l don't know that l fancy this.
His Majesty is in a frightful rage.
Excuse me, sir.
As an all-round entertainer, l am considered not without talent.
Perhaps l can cheer him up.
No, no. You don't understand.
As everyone knows,
His Majesty is the world's greatest soccer player.
But due to a technical problem, the Royal Cup match cannot take place today.
And His Majesty had so set his heart on it!
Throw these... creatures back into the sea.
Aye, aye, sir.
Just a moment! l can help!
Do you really think so? l'd be most grateful.
Do you know soccer?
Do l know anything about soccer?
Why, l was captain of Tottenham
Hotspurs for two years.
Three seasons with Manchester United...
Yes, yes. You'll do.
Come this way, please.
Mr Browne, are you certain you'll be all right?
Now what?
Not an ideal person in many respects, but Mr Browne is a very brave man.
Do you think he's done for?
Do you think so? l can't tell you how l appreciate this.
For some reason we have great difficulty finding referees round here. lf there be one thing we like, it's volunteers, eh, Birdy?
He's a proper king!
Look at his crown!
What's he got round his neck?
What a magnificent... ornament, sire.
Ah, yes.
Wouldn't be without it.
Been in the family for years.
The Star of Astoroth!
You're to sit in His Majesty's royal box.
No littering, no chewing, no fruit or wrappers or sweets. Please.
Rise, please.
Loyal fans, this is official.
We have a volunteer referee.
Let the match begin!
He's still wearing it!
Right, Dirty Yellows, let's have a clean game.
Right, True Blues, best foot forward.
Weird sort of game they play here.
Hurry up! Get rid of it!
Gracious!
You're doing fine, matey.
Move it around.
Get on with the match!
- Foul!
- They're only animals.
That's no excuse for dirty football.
Ref, are you blind?
Be quiet, Charles!
Don't forget who the referee is!
- Don't they have no rules?
- Course they do.
The king makes them up as he goes along.
Poor Mr Browne.
Do you think he's all right?
Well, he's moving.
Steady, matey. Move it around.
He almost had it then.
Looks like he's done for this time.
Don't just stand there! Head it in!
Stop... that... ball!
Goal!
Game's over. l win.
Let me give you a hand, matey.
That's quite all right, Your Majesty.
Thank you so much.
Please, let me help you on with your robe.
Why, yes. Thank you.
Can't have you catching cold, sire, can we?
Why, no.
Have you ever heard of something called the gypsy switch?
No, can't say that l have.
Remind me to tell you about it some time. l can't tell you when we've had such a good time.
We'll carry your memory in our hearts for a long while. l think it's time to leave.
Must you go?
Must be dashing. Marvellous game.
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.
Friendly lot.
Don't mind them visiting.
Wouldn't want them living here.
- Come along, children.
- Hurry up.
Stop gibbering!
What's the matter with you?
Your Royal Star!
They've stolen your Royal Star!
Don't be ridiculous.
What do you think this is?
Why didn't you say so?
Paul, put the knob on the bed.
At last the magic words.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee. l'll keep it.
Women always lose things.
- Hurry, Paul! The knob!
- lt's stuck!
- l suppose l'd better do something.
- Please do. Quick.
Got it.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree...
Oh, bother. l do hate shoddy work. l shall never get used to this thing.
Will you push the bed back into place, please? l think we could all do with a nice cup of tea.
No time. l've gone to a lot of trouble to find this spell. l'm going to try it immediately.
Mr Browne, kindly let me have your shoes, please.
- Fine.
- What's the shoes for? lf you'd been paying attention l should think you'd be aware that substitutiary locomotion is the art of causing inanimate objects to take on a life force of their own. l must have inanimate objects to experiment with.
Makes sense, don't it?
Stand back, everyone. l need plenty of room. l want you all to be absolutely quiet.
Mr Browne, you have the Star of Astoroth, l believe.
Oh, yes. lt's in my nice clean hanky. lt's all right, Mr Browne. l should have realised that it would be impossible to take an object from one world into another. lf only l would have had the sense to remember the words on that star.
- l know the words.
- Don't bother her. She's thinking.
Why don't you and l nip out and get something for supper?
And l might conceivably call into the pub for a pint to steady my nerves. l do know the words, Miss Price.
How can you know the words when Miss Price doesn't?
Troop movements and massing
of barges in French and Dutch ports.
The prime minister
has told the nation
to be on the alert for signs
of a possible invasion.
That was the news. l might have been able to do something about this. lt's out of your hands now, my dear. lf only l could have remembered those words. lt's maddening.
Why don't someone ask me?
Come off it, Paul. You can't remember those kind of words.
You mean like ''Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee''?
- How do you know that?
- Easy.
Says so right here in my book.
You mean it was there in your book all the time?
Yeah. But nobody ever listens to me.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
Nothing happened!
Am l doing something wrong?
Well, it does seem a bit old-fashioned.
After all, we are in the 20th century.
- What do you suggest?
- lt needs rhythm. Tempo.
Music.
As l always say, do it with a flair.
- Do you mind if l have a go?
- Of course not.
Come along, you lot!
We need all the help we can get.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
Substitutiary locomotion
Mystic power that's far
beyond the wildest notion
It's so weird, so feared,
yet wonderful to see
Substitutiary locomotion come to me
Now!
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.
I don't want locomotiary substitution
Or remote intransecory convolution
Only one precise solution is the key
Substitutiary locomotion it must be
Substitutiary locomotion
Lovely substitutiary locomotion
You've made substitutiary history
With treguna mekoides
and a little help from me
- With treguna mekoides and...
- Trecorum satis dee
Mr Browne, what is going on here? l haven't the foggiest.
How do you do?
Shall we?
- That's my nightgown!
- ls it really, my dear? l'm not responsible for its behaviour.
Obviously not, my dear.
Paul, what on earth are you doing?
Having a jolly good time, that's what.
- How can we stop all this?
- Must we? lt's most agreeable.
But we must do something.
Didn't l give you my all-purpose cut-off spell?
- Lesson number eight.
- Eight.
- Yes, number eight l think it was.
- Oi! My Sunday trousers!
Buzz off, old chap.
Find your own dancing partner.
Be careful, Carrie! Slow down!
Mr Browne, will you please control your shoes?
Dear lady, l very much fear that we have nothing under control.
Do you mind?
Now, who would like some more of my lovely sausages and mash?
- No more for me, thank you.
- Carrie? l've already had two helpings.
- l'm full.
- Me, too.
At least somebody wants some.
Cheer up, my dear. This should be something of a celebration. l'm sorry, but there doesn't seem to be much to celebrate.
- l still haven't mastered that spell.
- Of course you have.
You just need a little more practice.
- Do you really think so?
- No doubt about it.
Meantime, there's nothing to liven the spirits like a little master juggling.
Right, Charlie?
Go on then, guv!
Give us some juggling!
Very few better than me at this.
All you need is 20 years' practice and a touch of genius.
Never happened to me before. l don't usually juggle with cats under my feet.
Look! She's laughing!
- Mrs Hobday. Do come in.
- l can't stop, my dear. l've just come by to bring you the good news.
Mr Bistlethwaite, who brings the milk, you know?
He's promised to take the children in!
He and his wife have got that farm.
Just the place for growing children.
Put a bit of colour back in their cheeks.
Why, what's the matter? l thought you'd be pleased.
You told me yourself that you had no time to take care of children.
Circumstances have changed somewhat.
We got a dad now. Mr Browne.
- Paul!
- Miss Price, is this true?
Of course. You do want him to stay with us, don't you, Miss Price? l suppose l hadn't really thought about it.
What about him?
What do you say about it, Mr Browne? lt's all rather sudden! l don't quite know what to say.
Then l'll leave you two to talk it over. l'll come back in the morning!
Good night! lt is true, Mr Browne. You are going to be our father now, aren't you?
We are rather rushing things, aren't we?
Perhaps Mr Browne has other things besides you children to think about.
Yes. As a matter of fact l should have left ages ago. l must get a train back to London tonight. lt's rather an important matter. l'd like to tell you about it, but it's a little bit hush-hush.
Sort of a secret.
Well... if... lf l've been any sort of help to you, l'm pleased.
You've been immensely kind.
Thank you. l've enjoyed being with you.
Perhaps it's been good for all of us.
Will you be coming back?
Some day, my dear. l certainly hope that we shall meet again.
Some day.
When all this war business is over.
- l see.
- Perhaps l shall realise my dream.
Eglantine and Emelius: illusionists extraordinary!
Just think how that will look on the poster.
The children are going to miss you.
- You really think they will?
- Yes.
Well, l shall miss you. All of you. lf l don't go now you might never get rid of me.
Goodbye, Carrie.
- Must you really go?
- l think it's best for everybody.
- Goodbye, Paul.
- l think you should be our father.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Do you want me to come down to the station with you?
No, no. You stay here and look after everybody.
- Goodbye, Miss Price.
- Goodbye, Mr Browne.
- When is the next train to London?
- Lord bless ye, ain't no train.
Not until milk job,
4 a.m. tomorrow morning.
- Mind if l await it here?
- Suit yourself. Good night, sir.
Good night.
Out you go, Cosmic.
Hello?
Emelius Browne, do you know
you could be warm and cosy
in that house at this very moment?
For once in your useless life,
you really seem to have been needed.
You're a failure, Emelius Browne,
and a coward.
No, Fräulein, this is not the invasion, just a little exercise.
A minor raid to induce panic and to spread a little mischief.
When you English get it through your head that the German forces can land whenever and wherever we please, perhaps you will consider reasonable peace.
Not bloody likely!
Go on, Miss Price. Do it to him. l must say, it's very tempting.
Colonel, how would you feel about being turned into a white rabbit? l said, how would you feel about being turned into a white rabbit?
Be quiet, please.
Filigree, apogee, epogee...
- Not again!
- Your memory, Miss Price.
Would you kindly fetch my notebook from the workroom?
Righto.
Silence!
We have work to do. l am sorry, but l must send all of you some place where you will no longer be a nuisance.
As the words sell the tune
And the moonbeams the moon
All I need to succeed in my plan
Is a champion rare
with a flourish and a flair
Eglantine!
Where's the spell for rabbits?
The easiest of all, she said.
Confound it, can't women ever learn to file things properly?
Here it is.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
That's it.
Filigree... apogee, pedigree, perigee.
Come along. For once in your life, you've got to believe in something.
That's it. Good lad.
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
What's the use of putting us in that draughty castle? lt's quite chilly.
The colonel believes when a British female decides to become a nuisance, she can become the greatest nuisance in the world, and l'm inclined to agree with him.
You need a lesson in manners. lf l had my notebook, l'd make certain you'd learn a few.
Jumping Jehosophat! More Jerries!
Take it easy, can't you?
- Try holding your breath.
- l am holding it.
We could strip him down and grease him with soap.
No, it's no good. We can't do it. l could have told you that in the first place. lf we can't get Paul out we'll just have to think of something else.
What about that spell that makes things move about?
- But l'd need weapons.
- How about all these things? l'm afraid they're a bit ancient.
- Where did this come from?
- lt's Mr Browne!
He's on his way to London.
Mr Browne? lf you are Mr Browne, would you get off my lap? lt is Mr Browne! lt is you!
You didn't think that l could do that spell, did you? l am glad to see you!
But what about all these Germans?
What's wrong with the substitutiary locomotion spell?
- That ought to be useful.
- lt isn't ready yet.
- You saw what happened.
- We have to chance it.
We can't let these so-and-sos get away with their beastly little raid.
Won't you get up off the floor?
We'll go to work.
- Jolly good luck, my dear.
- Thank you.
Let's hope you haven't forgotten the spell.
- Not this time.
- Found this in the castle.
Probably not magic, but it might make you feel more at home.
Thank you.
That was very thoughtful of you.
Let's get out of Miss Price's way.
Treguna... mekoides... trecorum... satis dee.
Look!
Sound the advance!
Just in time for the kick-off.
Steady on the left.
Victory for England and St George!
Like a Lord Mayor's show!
Pikemen, hold your distance.
Treguna mekoides
and trecorum satis dee
Blimey!
- Where's it coming from?
- Sounds like the sea road, sir.
Come on, lads! After me.
Good shooting, bowmen!
Well caught, sir. Very good.
Knock his block off! That's it!
Mr Browne, make those children take cover!
Are you still there, Colonel? l thought you'd be on your way by now.
You see? Things may not be so easy for you after all.
Goodbye, Colonel!
Eglantine.
Dear Mr Browne.
- We thought they'd damaged you.
- See? No one can hurt Miss Price.
There they are, lads! l said something was afoot!
All right. Drive them into the sea.
Firing positions. Both sides.
All right, men. Hold your fire. l think we've taught the Hun a lesson.
He'll think twice before coming back here again. lt's tragic. All your spells, your equipment. All gone.
Still, l was able to perform some small service first.
That mean you ain't gonna be a witch no more? Never?
No, Paul. l realised some time ago that l could never be a proper witch.
Was it that first magic moment when you laid eyes on me?
No. lt was the day my poisoned dragon's liver arrived. l knew that anyone who felt the way l did about poisoned dragon's liver had no business being a witch.
- Certain you're doing the right thing?
- Well, l think so. lt's much too dangerous being a civilian.
Take care of yourself, guv. l'll do that. And l'll be back before you've grown an inch taller.
- We'll be together again.
- Sounds like you have an escort.
Well, here we go.
- Permission to move off, sir.
- Carry on, sergeant.
Parade, by the right, quick march!
Suppose that's it.
We ain't gonna have no fun no more.
Still got this, ain't l?

Son of a bitch.
Anyway, the cop is sitting there, sipping his coffee, you see?
And he's scratching his head.
He's completely confused by now.
- He says to the drunk...
- How's it going, Philo?
..."What about the guy in bed with your wife?"
And the drunk says, "The hell with him.
Let him make his own coffee."
You get it?
"Let him make his own coffee."
Excuse me.
That's funny, but don't give up your day job.
Come on, Big Al.
Let's have some fun.
You want to go some place?
- Hey, Big Al. Are you married?
- I used to be.
I know this place in the valley.
We could go get a couple drinks.
Lots of action there. Great fun.
What do you say?
Hey. Put them back.
- You talking to me?
- This ain't the Salvation Army.
Put them back.
I got plenty of peanuts, Big Al.
- You mean these?
- Yeah, asshole.
- Unless you're taking them to your tree.
- Shit. Excuse me, gents.
The squirrel is taking his peanuts up to his tree.
The squirrel is ripping off peanuts, ain't you, squirrel?
Going to take them up to your tree?
All right.
- Come on, guys. Knock it off.
- Get him!
Attaboy!
- Come on, get out of here, you guys.
- Get him.
Outside. Come on, guys.
Outside!
Hey, Orville, what's doing?
Ma's going to try it again.
I should have remembered my wig.
You think it'll make any difference?
I don't know, Ma.
I don't expect that's all they're going to be looking at.
Don't be in such a fired, big hurry.
I want to look at these pictures one time more.
I always did have trouble with these squiggly lines.
I hope you pass it this time, Ma, because there ain't too many more...
...of these places we can go to.
They all know you.
They don't know how I drive.
Don't none of them know how good I drive.
Been driving since before them sons of bitches were born.
Come on, get out.
Here.
You're getting pretty tricky, Clyde.
You've done real good, Ma.
Meathead.
Waited till I passed the whole test before he tells me I'm too old.
I should have remembered my wig.
The hell with everybody.
Come on, get going, for God's sake.
- Philo, are you out here?
- No, I ain't.
What are you doing?
Are you working on the car?
Orville, that's two dumb questions in a row you've asked me.
Here.
Help me put that block under the car here.
- This one here?
- Yeah.
You want it under the wheel or under the spring?
Under the spring.
There you go.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
Ma's pissed. It's Clyde.
He got out this morning, came over, and shit all over everything.
How did she get him back?
That's what she's pissed about.
She had to bribe him with all her Oreos.
Well, I'll make it up to her.
- You got one going tomorrow?
- Yeah, you coming?
Sure am.
Who wants some action around here?
- There you go, my man. What's the name?
- Name?
- John Hatfield.
I got you, my man. Thank you. Who else?
How much you want?
Quick, talk to me, my man.
- Give me $80.
- $80. Let me see that.
- Name?
- Jackson.
All right, listen, I've got $100.
Who wants to make a side-bet, here?
Come on, guys. Talk up!
He may be good, but he ain't no Tank Murdock.
Take it.
- We won't have anything...
- Take it.
You're on.
- Who's gonna hold this?
- You hold it.
No problem, you're fine.
Church, let's go, man.
You got him.
- Come up here, Clyde. There you go.
- Put this bum away!
Don't waste any time on the guy, just put him away.
Put him away now, Church!
Put him away.
Thank you. $5, $100 and $200...
...$500, $600, $900...
Clyde could have beat him.
I kind of like this.
That one's a redhead.
- I'll take the one on the left.
- All right.
The one stuffing her face with chowder.
Let's go over there and see what she's drinking.
Hi.
My name's Philo.
Do you mind if I sit here for a while?
Suit yourself.
I don't recall seeing you around here.
I've never been here before.
Where do you go when you're not here?
My name is Carol. I go to USC.
I major in sociology.
I'm here because I'm doing a paper on the country-western mentality.
Well, that just blew five minutes of our conversation.
Well, you asked if you could sit.
You didn't say nothing about talking.
Who are you mad at?
- I don't suppose you have a light, do you?
- No, I don't smoke.
Excuse me.
Orville.
Tell me, just what is the country-western mentality?
Well, if the lyrics of this song are any indication...
...it's somewhere between moron and dull-normal.
Oh, my... Jesus Christ.
You are disgusting.
Let's leave. Go.
What happened?
This wild clam got out of control. Take it.
Did you see her face?
You could've put a turd in there and she couldn't gotten a better look on her.
Thank you so much.
Now, would you all put your hands
together and keep the applause going?
Let's all give a big,
big Palomino welcome...
... to pretty Miss Lynn Halsey...
... Taylor.
Thank you. Okay. Ready, boys?
Let's get out of here.
I want to watch this chick for a minute.
That's awful nice. Lynn Halsey...
... Taylor.
You can come back anytime, honey.
Excuse me.
Could I put this back there for a while?
- Sure can.
- Thank you.
- You sure sing pretty.
- Well, thank you.
I'd really be pleased if I could buy you a drink.
Sure.
- I'd like a beer.
- Two of those.
I didn't get your name in the introduction.
My name's Philo Beddoe.
Lynn Halsey-Taylor.
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?
- She sure ran out pretty fast.
- Oh, her. I hardly knew her a minute.
A minute?
Well, you must go through a lot of women like that.
- That was a nice song. Did you write that?
- No. Wish I did.
Just a song my daddy used to sing to me when I was little.
When you were little?
That's where I know you from.
When I was in third grade
I knew a girl that looked enough like you...
...it makes my memory water.
You sure do talk funny.
Kind of smoky in here.
- Would you like to...
- I'd love to.
Say, it's kind of smoky in here.
So, I decided there was nothing
I liked doing better than singing.
- So, here I am.
- Am I glad.
Row 3. That's my lucky number.
I'll tell you what:
You're my lucky number.
Would you like to...
...have me in for a while, maybe?
I'd love to.
- Only...
- Only?
- Only my boyfriend, Schyler, is sleeping.
- Boyfriend?
- He wouldn't mind.
- He wouldn't?
So long as you don't drive his car.
Well, I think maybe we could make it some other time when he ain't around.
Okay. Whatever you say.
Slightly advanced.
Look, man, it's an ape!
Yeah. Which one's the ape?
- What did you say?
- That looks your girlfriend.
Hey, buddy.
Are you taking your mother for a ride?
- Take that up there, baby.
- Hey.
- So long, apeshit.
- Son of a bitch.
What the hell's this?
We'll get them, right, boy?
Clyde, get your hands off the wheel.
- Let's get the hell out of here. He's crazy.
- Follow me.
- Hey, why did you come in here?
- He'll never find us in here.
Get those things out of here.
Roll up your window.
Shit!
Get them out of here. Freaks!
Hey, man, what in the hell is going on?
- Do you think we ought to stop and fight?
- Nope.
Let's catch that train.
Take it easy.
It's a monkey.
Crazy monkey!
Are you okay? Thanks, Clyde.
If you don't like him, how come you stay with him?
Because he promised to help me get the $7,000.
"Best I can"
- For what?
- "It's hard for me to say no
"to a truck drivin' man"
For the down payment.
- What do you want to buy?
- "Cadillac that I still don't have the time
"Keep the fool who wants to marry me dangling on my line"
My own club back home in Denver.
I'm going to call it the Lynn Halsey-Taylor Drinking Fountain.
"Hard for me to say no to a truck driving man"
That will be the name of my group, too.
I'll have talent night three nights a week.
How much of the $7,000 do you have already?
He won't tell me.
Well, about the only thing of any value I've got is Clyde.
- Clyde?
- Yeah, he's my ape.
- I won him in a fight.
- You won him?
Yeah.
They brought him over here to make a baby.
- You mean he's from Africa?
- No, he's from Sumatra.
When he got here, the other male orang they had on hand had already done the job.
You're kidding?
Yeah, so Clyde got real mean as hell, so they sold him to a desert zoo.
- Desert zoo?
- One of those places out in the desert...
...says, "Real, live dragon, cactus candy, five miles ahead," that sort of thing.
That's where I won him.
I bet my truck and two dirt bikes on him.
- You must have wanted him a lot.
- I really hated to see him in that cage.
- So, who'd you fight for him?
- These four guys.
Four guys?
You would have thought after the first couple lost they'd have given up.
- Well, I fought all four at once.
- All four at once?
- You like to fight?
- I used to. Better than anything.
Well, almost anything.
So, why didn't you turn professional?
None of that stuff. There's too many rules.
You're just a regular Tank Murdock.
- You know him?
- I know of him.
He's from Denver and he's a regular institution.
You bet he is.
Now that is one guy
I'd like to meet up with.
Well, I'd really like to meet Clyde.
And you will. You will.
Right now we'll meet my friend, Orville.
He's waiting on us.
So, Tank was in the back seat of this car with this debutante.
I mean, her daddy owned the whole town.
- And his buddy was in the trunk.
- And then what happened?
Well, you see, she was so pure...
...that nobody believed these wild stories that Tank had been telling about her.
- What happened?
- You got to use your imagination, Orville.
Anyway, after...
...she heard all this bumping around and laughing coming from the trunk.
And she started to scream.
So, all these cops came in, six or eight of them.
Tank tried to explain, but nobody believed him because they all knew him.
He must have put four cops in the hospital.
It took about 12 of them to take him in.
Man.
- One thing I want to know about the story.
- What?
Who let that poor guy out of the trunk?
Shit, he's probably still there.
Those two creeps over there asked me to bring this to the lady.
This was mighty nice of you.
- Do you see that?
- An arm?
No, that.
A tattoo?
They don't know what this means.
Do you see that?
- Sorry.
- Two tattoos.
Them's black widows.
Did you know that more people die from black widows than rattlers each year?
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
Well, listen, I sure do appreciate knowing that because...
...most of the people I know just step on them and squish them.
I don't need this cheap shit.
Orville, that's no way to thank two guys that just bought us a beer.
Why don't you get the check and
I'll go outside and thank them properly?
Okay.
- Go ahead.
- You started it.
Shouldn't you go with him?
Sure is good pecan pie.
I think we'd better get out of here.
Cut it out, Clyde.
Ma, what'd you do that for?
Been trying to get your attention for five minutes.
Did you see Orville?
- Yeah. I saw him.
- Well? Orville tell you what?
Yeah, and I'm sorry, Ma, about you missing your driver's test again.
That ain't the one what I mean.
You mean Clyde?
I'm sorry about that too, Ma.
He won't do it again, I promise.
- What are you gonna do about it?
- What? The crap or the Oreos?
About Clyde! Goddamn it!
I don't have no privacy in my own home no more.
Well, I confronted him about it, Ma.
I guarantee it won't happen again.
No privacy in your own home.
A whole goddamn bag of Oreos.
Stop that, you goddamn baboon.
No respect. No privacy.
No nothing.
Bang.
- You're late, pretty boy.
- Shut up.
I don't believe this.
Damn.
I never knew nobody who could hit so hard or so fast.
- He could've been Denver Tank Murdock.
- That's right.
- Sound like him?
- Don't know.
Didn't get to see him so close as Elmo.
At least I didn't drop my bike and run.
Like you two! You big suckers!
Shut up!
Now, it isn't bad enough...
...that you let somebody else kick your butts...
...without you trying to do it to each other.
If we're all talking about the same man...
...and I think we are...
...then it appears he's got a rather growing collection of our bikes.
Yeah, but we don't know for sure if he took them or not.
- We were...
- Unconscious for two hours!
- Sick son of a bitch.
- It's not true!
Shut up!
The very first thing we do...
...is find out who we're talking about.
I mean, we don't even know where to find him.
How are we going to find him?
Well, it appears to me that there can't be too many guys...
...driving around this valley with an ape.
- What you got sticking out here?
- Open it.
- It sure feels heavy.
- Open it.
- Philo. God, where'd you get this?
- Off a couple little old widows.
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.
More people are dying to buy widow bikes than are dying by rattler bites every year.
Well.
- You like it?
- Well, yeah.
That I do.
Wait until Clyde sees you in this outfit.
- What's the matter?
- I'm okay.
- House not too good tonight?
- I'm okay, Philo.
Well, at least this outfit you bought me was a big hit.
I don't like the way this guy's driving.
Get down!
Is that somebody you know?
Schyler.
- I thought you said he didn't care.
- He must have changed his mind.
Philo, I'm scared.
- I won't let anything happen to you.
- That's not what I'm afraid of.
I'm afraid for Schyler.
Please don't hurt him.
He tried to shoot me and didn't care that you were next to me.
That's just it.
He was just trying to scare you.
He doesn't even know how to shoot.
I sure don't like the way he's trying to find out.
Philo, I know him.
He's probably in there now...
...hiding, scared out of his wits.
I don't like to see you cry.
Let me talk to him. Please.
I don't know.
Please. For me. Please.
All right. You talk to him.
And you tell him that I want you to come with me...
...and I want you to stay with me, you hear?
Philo.
Here. I want you to dry those tears.
- I want you to take this. It's the dough.
- I couldn't take that.
Yes, you can.
I want you to have it now, you hear?
- Okay.
- I don't want you to cry no more.
Clyde, how'd you get out?
What, did you pull the lock off?
How'd you get out?
No, you don't. Come on. No, you don't.
Give me that! Give me it!
What?
Good Clyde.
Just hold that truck up, Clyde.
What are you doing, Clyde?
- Philo.
- Yeah.
Call this son of a... No, don't call him.
Don't call him. Good Clyde.
That's it, Clyde. Hold it up.
How many times have I told you?
I don't want him drinking beer, except on Saturday night.
- Don't expect I'll need these no more.
- Take it easy, Ma. This is the easy part.
Awful glad there ain't no more of them squiggly pictures.
Good. Maybe you'll do it this time.
Maybe. Well, I guess I will.
Why didn't you tell him you wear glasses?
It's none of his goddamn business what I wear.
Just wear them to read, anyway.
Was there anything else?
Told me I was too old.
Meathead! Orville.
Yes, Mother?
- Next time I'll wear my glasses.
- Good.
Goddamn it.
God, you're a handsome devil.
Clyde, you're going to meet a lady now.
I want you to handle it.
That means no spitting, pissing, farting or picking your ass.
You hear me? Because if you do,
I'll throttle you. Understand?
Man, I'll tell you something.
Clyde, this has got to stop.
People are going to talk, you know?
- What is it?
- That trailer that was parked down there.
What happened to it?
- What spot?
- That spot right over there.
I don't see it.
- Well, where'd it go?
- It's gone.
I know it's gone, goddamn it, but where'd it go?
- Back home, I suppose.
- Denver?
Some folks just don't take me into their confidence.
The plates said Colorado.
Sound right to you?
- When'd they leave?
- This morning.
Thanks.
Goodbye, now.
Hey, Philo. I've got a message for you.
Why don't you watch what the hell you're doing?
Why don't you shut your face, boy?
What have we got here?
A real, live, macho cowboy.
Don't turn your back.
- Somebody call the cops.
- They are the cops.
Shit.
- She didn't say where she was going?
- Nope.
- Well, how do you know where to look?
- I'll know.
Well, how do you know she wants you to come looking for her?
There you go asking those dumb questions again.
- Is Clyde going?
- Yes.
- You got room for one more?
- Yes.
Got you!
I'm coming.
- Which way are we headed?
- East.
Sounds reasonable.
East? What are you gonna do with the baboon?
Orangutan, Ma. Clyde's an orangutan.
- What's the difference?
- He has 12 ribs, just like you and me.
- What are you going to do with him?
- He's coming with me. Come on.
Well, when are you coming back?
- When are you coming back?
- Whenever it's time, Ma.
It don't seem right to leave an old lady alone.
And what about my goddamn license?
This is... It's just...
Twelve ribs.
I don't believe any of that shit!
This machine is very sensitive.
What do you think you'll find here?
You never know what you'll find here.
Just listen.
It picks up all kinds of metal.
Swiss watches, expensive foreign cameras, silver dollars. Gold, man.
- Gold?
- Yeah.
- Herb.
- Yeah.
What are we going to do about that son of a bitch?
- Who?
- You know who I'm talking about.
That cowboy at the Palomino Club.
I don't know what you can do about him.
What can we do, man?
You mean to stand there and tell me you'd let him get away with it?
You got anything in mind?
What I got in mind is to break his stupid head.
- Listen, are you sure that thing works?
- Sure it works. Just keep digging.
Besides, you don't even know where to find him.
Don't worry. I'll find him.
I got a plan.
- What's that?
- I'm going to use my medical leave.
What are you laughing at?
You're going to spend your two weeks medical leave looking for him?
I'll spend the next two years looking for him if I have to.
- What's up?
- Pit stop.
- Are these cantaloupes fresh?
- Yes.
- Are they today's?
- Yes. They just came in.
No, I only want a quarter of a pound.
These only cost a quarter a pound.
I only want a quarter of a pound of tomatoes.
Yes, ma'am. Right.
Can I have a fresh bag now?
I'll take these two cantaloupes.
How much are they a pound?
Cantaloupes are 29 cents a pound.
I think they were cheaper down the road.
I don't know why you're so expensive here.
Ma'am.
- Can you help me out?
- Sure.
- What's your name?
- Echo.
Echo.
Do you want some cantaloupes?
Those are beautiful.
Thank you. How many would you like?
Do you live around here?
Yeah. Down past the wash.
Where's the wash?
How come you want to know so much about me?
Because I never met anyone that made me feel like you do.
Right out of the gate.
- Where are you headed?
- East.
- What's your name?
- Echo.
- What?
- Echo.
Orville.
What did you say, anyway, that made that woman storm away?
I told her you had the clap.
All right, spread out.
- Hey, heifer, how's the slop?
- Suits the clientele real good.
Looking real good.
Don't you got no special of the day?
Liver and onions.
Why don't you read the menu?
Maybe I'd rather talk to you.
Has Philo Beddoe been around?
You want to talk, take a walk.
You want to eat, take a seat.
What are you laughing at? Lard-ass!
I'll tell you what:
Turn around and walk out that door, and I'll forget what you said.
And I won't tell everybody that you drink horse piss.
- Elmo, Cholla, did you hear what he said?
- I heard it.
- I'll just keep this warm for you, Lester.
- Okay, big mouth, let's go.
You want me to keep a piece of that lemon meringue?
Yeah, this won't take but a minute.
Let's go, cutes.
Drinking horse piss. What is this?
- Hey, come on!
- Get him, come on!
Kick him in the nuts.
Kick him in the shins.
Come on over here. Give me a hand.
Where you going? Get back here.
That's it.
Get this little son of a gun right there.
Good.
Hurry up. Get out of there, Roy.
Look out.
My God.
Spread out!
Goddamn morphadites.
Come on.
Get the hell out of the way. Hurry.
Let's go.
Move it.
- Who is it?
- The police.
I'm coming. I'm coming, goddamn it!
What do you want with an old lady?
Ma'am, we're looking for Philo Beddoe.
Our records say he lives at this address.
Well, your records are wrong.
He lives at that address in the back.
What do you want him for?
- Just looking for him, ma'am.
- Well, he don't live there anymore.
He's gone off.
Took that son of a bitch, Clyde, with him.
Clyde?
His ape.
His ape?
You heard me.
What you making me repeat myself for?
Do you know where he's gone?
Who gives a damn? Stealing all my Oreos.
Crapping all over the place.
Twelve ribs, my ass!
- Thank you. Sorry to bother you.
- Yeah.
I'm sorry, too, you see.
Leave an old lady alone, fending for herself.
No protection.
It just don't seem...
Well, I don't suppose you know of a ladies' room hereabouts?
They're all over.
Just pick one.
- She's something, ain't she?
- She sure is.
You're full of all kinds of surprises these days.
Listen, I want to say that I appreciate your making her feel at home.
Clyde.
There's something out there!
God, it's horrible! It's a monster.
- It's not even a bear. It's a...
- No, Echo, it's just Clyde.
Hey, Echo! Wait. Give me... What?
Take it easy. You're going to scare him.
- Me, scare him?
- That's right.
Let me introduce you. Echo, this is Clyde.
Clyde, this is Echo. Echo.
Did you get it?
It's okay. See?
- Hey, granny, how they hanging?
- Hey, hot damn.
- What are you doing tonight, honey?
- Let her alone. She's mine. I saw her first.
- Say, old lady. Where's Philo Beddoe?
- How the hell do I know?
Get off my porch with that thing.
Get off my property!
You're not very hospitable.
Hospitable, my ass. Get off my porch!
Very well. If you insist.
All right, lady. Put that gun down!
I'm warning you, lady.
Put down that gun, now!
Wait for me!
First, the police.
I told those boys not to leave a vulnerable old lady all alone.
Hospitable? Horseshit!
- Police.
- Yeah?
I want to ask you questions about a girl.
Her name was Lynn Halslay-Taylor.
Halsey.
Yeah. She was here, but she left.
Hey, man.
How come that cat ain't moving?
You think he's dead?
Shit, man, if he's the only one here, let's have some fun.
Shut up!
But he's only one old man.
It was only one old woman that nearly ruinated all of you.
Yeah.
Maybe we ought to split.
Hello, there.
You in there?
What is it?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, I'm looking for a girl that used to stay around here.
- She was with a guy named Philo Beddoe.
- Don't know no Philo Beddoe.
Well, the girl's name was Halsey-Taylor.
Lynn Halsey-Taylor.
She must've been one jim-dandy of a girl.
You're the third one come to ask about her since she left for Denver.
- You don't say.
- Yeah.
- Could I put that back there?
- Sure, doll. It'll be here when you need it.
- Buy you a drink?
- Sure.
Taste that, too.
Here.
Get out of my stuff, Clyde.
Here, take a piece of this. That's my salad.
Why don't you two take the truck?
Clyde and I are going to go check around.
- What's going on?
- Orville, you've got to get up.
- Why?
- Because it just isn't right, that's why.
- What isn't right?
- What isn't right?
It just ain't right. I mean...
I mean, you two have somebody.
And I've almost got somebody.
And it just ain't right.
- Well, what isn't right about it?
- You just don't understand, do you?
Yeah. He just doesn't understand.
Right, and that's why we've got to do something about it.
We do?
Yeah. Here. Off your ass and on your feet.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talking about Clyde, damn it.
You think he doesn't understand.
He sits back there all the time. You don't think he understands, but he's smart.
And I'll tell you something, Orville.
He thinks about a lot of things besides Oreo cookies.
Right, Clyde?
- You don't mean...
- I mean exactly that.
Where the hell are we going to get
Clyde laid in the middle of the night?
Shit.
How the hell do you break into a zoo?
It's easy.
Zoos are meant to keep everybody in.
Listen to that.
He knows something good will happen.
Well, how do you know there's a lady in there for him?
I don't, but if there is one there...
...and he doesn't find it, he wouldn't know what to do, anyway. Give me a hand.
Come on.
Well, what do you want us to do?
The place is probably guarded, so I want you to stay here and keep an eye out.
Come on, pal.
Okay. All right, Clyde.
Up.
Boy, I bet there's a gal in there.
Think there's a lady in there?
You bet, man.
Clyde, you think there's a lady in there?
Come on. Clyde.
Orville.
When we get to this next town, you should drum up some action.
We're getting a little short on cash.
Sure, why not.
Do you know where the meat-packing plant is?
- No. But I'll find it.
- All right, I'll see you there.
You got it.
I don't care much for that perfume they're wearing.
- Do they know me here?
- No, it's even money.
- Anything else?
- Yeah. Guy's name is Kincaid.
He's a local champion. Taller than you.
About 240 pounds. I checked.
- And?
- They say he stacks up to Tank Murdock.
Tank Murdock?
You know, like them all, Tank's gonna fall.
And another thing, he fights dirty.
- Orville Boggs?
- You got it.
Okay, open the gate.
It's over there in the cold room.
- How much you want?
- What you got?
- We'll take it.
You've got to show me something besides conversation.
- I'll take that.
- All right, if I see yours.
What do you want us to do with the body?
Save your breath.
It's enough you'll lose your money.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, baby!
What's up?
I want you.
Come on, Philo, put him away!
Don't let him tag you!
What the hell are you doing, Philo?
It's getting cold in here!
- I think you owe us some money.
- What money?
Wait a minute.
You aren't gonna tell all these boys that you'll take their money, are you?
That was just so you'd know the first one was no accident.
Did you see this little filly shoot?
Where did you ever learn to do that?
You could shoot a gnat off a buffalo's ass.
- I told you I could take care of myself.
- She took care of us.
Car 103.
Proceed to the intersection
of Interstate 5 and Velasquez Road...
... for a 602.
103 here. Got you, over.
That 602's the same as our 406.
No way. It's got to be the same as our 309 or at the best our 213.
You're crazy.
No New Mexican 602 can come anywhere near California 309.
When's the last time you been out on a 309?
Maybe three or four months.
But it don't mean that I don't know that our 309 ain't more than their 602.
- What time you got?
Unit 103, abort that 602, 103.
Proceed to Velasquez Road
on Interstate 5 for a 607.
Well, kiss my...
I suppose you think I'm crazy traipsing across the country...
...after a girl I hardly even know.
Hell, I'm not like Orville.
It takes me a long time to get to know a girl.
Even longer to let her know me.
You know what I mean?
I'm not afraid of any man, but sharing my feelings with a woman...
...my stomach just turns to royal gelatin.
I don't suppose that ever happens to you.
I guess you just keep howling until sometime they howl back.
If this is a strike, it means Ronstadt and Parton move over.
It's Halsey-Taylor to the top.
It's okay. It just means it's going to take a little longer.
But we don't give up.
If I get this pickup...
...it means the same time next year...
...Halsey-Taylor has her own special.
That was a mighty fine pickup, little lady.
Thank you.
Will you mind Clyde for me?
I'm going to take a run.
All right.
Shit!
Hey, Lynn! Wait up!
Fancy meeting you here.
Incredible is more like it.
What are you doing?
Following you.
You picked me up just in time.
All this weather.
You took off so fast
I thought there was something wrong.
Bad time to run.
I figured maybe I'd better follow you.
Thought you'd better, huh?
Hell, you didn't even get a chance to meet Clyde.
Pull in right here.
I know where he keeps the money now, so it's a matter of finding the right time.
I still say my way would be quicker.
Philo, you promised.
Please don't make me sorry I told you.
You make me afraid to believe you.
I never want to make you sorry.
You want to come down and meet everybody?
No, I'd better go back.
We'll do it when we have more time.
Tomorrow night? Like we agreed?
El Patio Restaurant.
Philo?
You're really something.
Jesus Christ.
Goddamn, I don't believe what I'm seeing.
I think I'm still asleep and dreaming.
You're not dreaming. Come on.
Get your ass up.
Hi, Clyde. How you doing?
Let's let the little lady up.
What did you do that for?
I think he's trying to tell us something.
What's he trying to tell us?
Why are you so all fired happy, Philo?
Listen, the only time
I ever see you smiling is when...
You got laid?
You were jogging, and you picked up somebody and laid her.
- Did he?
- I'll do you one better than that.
- You mean Clyde got laid again, too?
- No. I ran into Lynn Halsey-Taylor.
How'd you do that?
I was running down the highway and she picked me up.
- Where is she now?
- She's in town.
She's getting things straightened up, we'll see her.
Goddamn, that is good news.
That means we can go home soon.
I don't see why not.
While we're waiting around for true romance...
...I think I'll jump down and get some flies.
There's no way I don't want to get in on this action.
- Help me finish these first, will you?
- Right.
Did you ever notice how drinking and fishing kind of go together?
- You sell fishing licenses in here?
- Sure do.
Something about the six-pack and the worms.
- Any good trout around here?
- About four or five miles down the road.
Orville.
Don't these look like the humpers
Clyde was eating this morning?
Are these the flies Philo wanted?
Grayish yellow.
Hey, Philo. Where's your boat?
I'm going to hang out here on shore.
Echo and I are going on down to the other end here.
- We got him?
- Got him.
Here. Be careful, it's loaded.
Why the scattergun?
- Because I don't want to miss that sucker.
- Makes sense.
Here.
Why all the fishing gear?
Because we got to look like we're going fishing, dummy.
Now look, I'll go right through there.
You go around the lake and come from behind him.
I'm going around this lake...
Damn it. Not so loud.
He'll hear you. It's not so far.
And here. Get going.
Now get going, will you?
Stinking hippie.
Quite a mess of fish.
Shit.
The white boy's the craziest son of a bitch in the world.
Where in the hell is that Putnam?
What are you doing, boy?
My God!
Feet!
Feet don't fail me now, man.
Goddamn apes, snakes, alligators and shit!
You so much as blink, and I'll blow a big hole in you.
Who are you and what do you want?
Just never you mind.
You'll find out soon enough.
What the hell was that?
- Jesus.
- Good Lord.
He must be 5 or 6 pounds.
Give him some slack.
Don't jerk, you'll lose him!
God, he's a monster.
Don't jerk him!
Give me that rod!
I've never seen anything like it in my life.
He's a monster!
He's a frigging monster!
I've never seen anything like it before.
He must weigh 25 pounds.
He's a stud! He's got to be a stud!
Come on, help me here.
Boy, he is a stud!
- Have a stud.
- Shit!
Putnam!
Big, dumb galoot.
Putnam, where are you?
Dummy.
What was that?
I think he's spending too much time with Clyde.
What are we supposed to do with all this stuff?
Eat it. All of it.
- "All of it"?
- All of it.
What if I can't?
Then we'll give it to Clyde.
Can you imagine what this would do to Clyde's digestive tract?
He already has enough gas to go to North Denver.
And he's never seen a bean in his life.
Say, when's your little lady coming here?
She should be along any time.
Let's get out of here.
Listen, Philo.
Does that mean we're going back to L.A.?
Hell, no. But when I find her...
...l'll take care of that guy she's with.
My way.
Hey, an Airstream!
Hey, Cholla! That's the one!
Howdy.
I bet you're Lynn Halsey-Taylor, ain't you?
Now how'd you know that?
Well, we been following you, all the way from Los Angeles.
You see me sing at the Palomino?
I'm sorry to say, I missed that, but I promise not to miss it next time.
Well, then, what did all you boys follow me all the way to Colorado for?
Do you know a guy named Philo?
Philo Beddoe?
He's been following you.
You know that?
Yeah, I know that.
Is he a friend of yours?
Not particularly.
You want to find him?
Not particularly.
We do.
Now, that's a nice looking truck.
There she is.
You stay here. This is personal.
Lynn!
You Philo Beddoe?
Do I know you?
You're going to.
Last time I saw you two, you were going for a fast freight.
The last time we saw you, you were dirt-diving in an alfalfa patch.
Philo Beddoe.
Your time has come.
Here we go again.
I got him.
The bikes, you dummies! The bikes!
The bikes!
Are those guys coming after me?
Those guys are coming after me!
I'll get him!
I'm going to kill you all!
Look out!
Watch out for the truck!
Hi, cutie pie. Want a ride?
- Don't mind if I do.
- Hop in.
Darling, I'm only glad you happened along when you did.
Nice day for a drive.
- Look at these guys coming up the road.
- I love this.
Ten points.
Get out of the way!
There's the boy.
- Thanks.
- Make sure that door's closed, would you?
Let's go get a bite to eat.
No, you go on ahead.
Clyde and me will eat later.
We'll bring you back something, okay, Philo?
Whatever.
He's locked into that phone book.
He must have called every place in town.
What are you hungry for?
Are you sure you don't want me to go in there and just hang out?
- He pulled a shotgun last time.
- This is personal. I'll handle it.
Why don't Echo and I just go in and have a beer and listen to the music?
- Do you want to borrow my pea shooter?
- Thanks. You two go have a good time.
See if you can find out the location of Tank Murdock.
- What will you have?
- A beer.
Lynn Halsey-Taylor, everybody.
All right!
It's great to have you back in Denver, Lynn.
And now, everybody,
the featured performer of the evening...
... the star of tonight's show,
Mr. Charlie Rich.
The best club out there is the Palomino, and the manager's a good friend.
So, I'll write him, tell him to give you a spot.
That's mighty nice of you.
Like me?
Want me?
- Let's go.
- Harlan.
I've got a friend. It's okay, though.
He won't mind, he just might want to come along.
Let's go.
- Is this your...
- No.
You want to talk to him?
The lady and I have a little business.
I expect you'll be excusing us.
Maybe you ought to excuse yourself.
It's okay, Harlan, I'll just be a minute.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's your own goddamn fault!
Who asked you to follow me?
- I just thought...
- You thought!
If you'd thought, you would've taken some very broad hints.
I've been trying to get rid of you practically ever since the first night we met.
- What about Taos?
- What about it?
I need it just like anybody else.
- You do this all the time.
- I do this all the time.
And you and me had our time, so why don't you know when to disappear?
- Come here.
- Take your hands off me!
Lynn? Is everything all right?
Schyler, this is the one from L.A.
The big, dumb one I told you about.
Schyler, with the shotgun?
That was my idea.
I was hoping he'd scare you away.
Why didn't you just say goodbye?
You're here, aren't you?
Guys like you don't understand goodbye.
What do you do? You hustle for him?
You're just not too smart, are you?
Why did you have to come?
Why couldn't you quit like everybody else?
You had to come chasing me and spoil it all.
I guess I'm just not too smart, that's all.
Up to now, I'm the only one dumb enough to want to take you further than your bed.
I hate you!
I hate you.
I hate you.
Well, listen, do you want to rest up a little bit?
- You don't have to take him tonight.
- No, that's fine.
- Are you Philo Beddoe?
- That's right.
Keep on walking, you'll see him.
- Here you go.
- Is that all the money?
- What's with the girl?
- Don't worry about it.
What do you mean, "Don't worry about it"?
Right to your left.
Don't worry about it, Philo.
This guy's a real porker.
He's carrying his reputation around his waist.
Looks like you've had a go at it already.
You sure that face won't hurt too much to fight?
- I ain't going to hit you with my face.
- That's funny.
I like you.
Don't worry, we'll get this over in a hurry and take care of you.
Where did you hear of Tank Murdock before, kid?
- All around.
- Yeah?
- They say you're the best.
- They do?
Well, let's get with it.
Jesus Christ, who is that guy?
I don't know, but he's the one that'll beat Tank Murdock.
Come on, Tank! Come on, get him!
Jesus Christ, that guy's going to beat Tank Murdock!
Get up! Come on!
This guy will be the new Tank Murdock!
- This is it for Tank!
- Who is this guy?
The new guy's beaten Tank!
You has-been! You ought to learn to box!
You old bum! You're all washed up!
That guy's the new Tank Murdock.
We're going to make money on this guy.
My champ!
"5, Z."
Just a minute there, now. "B."
Why don't you try that one with your glasses on?
Yes. Why didn't I think of that?
- There. Now try it again.
- Thank you, I will.
"5, Z, B, D, F."
- You did it.
- Of course I did.
Now, if you'd please step over there for your photograph.
- My what?
- Your photograph.
To put on your license.
My photograph.
Well, what will they think of next?
I think I forgot my comb.
Don't you worry.
Your hair looks quite lovely.
Do you really think so?
All right, you ready?
Let me get you focused.
All right, now smile. Big smile.
Come on, colonel.
- Get that jeep out of here.
Right, Kelly.
We've been here for two hours.
No, that's map section 3, not 4.
I don't give a damn what Command says about anything.
Look, Mulligan, I don't think
I'm getting through to you.
You' re dropping your damn barrage on our position.
Sit and see.
You can't hear me?
The reason you can't hear me...
...is because you're firing your mortar at your end...
...and they're dropping here at our end.
No, the Krauts are not here. We're here.
Mulligan, your bombs are coming down on our heads.
I don't know where the Krauts are.
Just lift your goddamn barrage. Over.
I told you to bring me some good-looking kid, not this fat, sausage-chewing wino.
Well, if you were looking for a young boy, you should've sent somebody else, Joe.
Mulligan, you son of a bitch.
Hey, Joe, it looks like they're trying to push up the canal.
What do you want me to do about it, Petuko?
The half-track's been wiped out.
- Eddie's been hit.
- Okay.
Go see what's happening. Grace, Jonesey, grab a litter and go with Corporal Job.
On the double.
Mickey Mouse.
- It's Mulligan.
- It's Mulligan. What the hell does he want?
He says he's sorry.
Sorry. Son of a bitch.
Mulligan.
Big Joe's a little upset right now.
I think maybe you should leave town.
Get out of the neighborhood.
Right.
Does he speak English?
Yeah, he's a colonel in Intelligence.
Here.
As a big noise with the German Intelligence you ought to be able to tell us about Nancy.
- Under the Geneva Convention you only...
- Sit down.
I'm not interested in defenses,
I'm interested in hotels. Okay?
Are there any still standing?
There are three.
Two are defended by units of...
And which is the most comfortable?
- I don't know.
Hey, look.
Think of us as tourists.
I don't want any military information.
I just want to know the best hotel.
- I think it is called the Majestic.
- And who's the owner?
I can't remember his name.
All right, all right.
Checkthe Michelin Guide.
Now, what about women?
I must warn you. The German Army is preparing a counter attack...
Sit down.
Look, we're not worried about the German Army.
We got enough troubles of our own.
To the right, General Patton.
To the left, the British Army.
To the rear, our own goddamn artillery.
And besides all that, it's raining.
The good thing about the weather...
...it keeps our Air Corps from blowing us to hell...
...because it's too lousy to fly.
Okay.
Now, what about the broads in Nancy?
- Broads?
- The women.
Yes, there is a house.
I cannot give you the directions.
I've never been there.
Hey, here it is. "Nancy.
Principal attractions:
The Church of the Cordeliers tombs.
Woodwork and statues.
City Hall, 18th century, with stairway and square reception room.
Palace Stanislas' impressive gates.
Porterie, Museum of Lorraine.
Charge to see... "
Will you cut the culture crap and get to the hotels?
Majestic Hotel, three stars, a knife and a fork.
Beautiful.
We keep this guy until we get to Nancy.
We can use him when we get to town.
- Hey, Joe.
What do you want, Barbara?
The captain wants to see you.
"The captain. "
I'll be right with you.
- What should I do?
- Stay on the radio.
Joe, I think we ought to send him back for interrogation.
Look, nobody's copping out on this.
Do you understand?
The colonel serves a more strategic purpose staying with us.
He needs interrogating, then you do it right here.
Open the door.
- Hey, Joe. Do me a favor, will you?
- What do you want?
- What?
- Don't call me Barbara.
- That's your name, isn't it?
- But my name's Babra.
- Come on, will you?
- I only wanted to...
What are these, colonel?
Just my orders and letters of transport.
Fisher?
- What are you transporting?
- Files.
What kind of files?
- Clerical.
- Clerical, huh?
Mind telling me what you were doing in this area?
I needed petrol for my trucks.
The bombing.
Trucks won't move without petrol.
- What do you want, Kelly?
- Interpret these for me, will you?
What are these?
Lead bars.
- Lead?
Yes, the bag was supposed to have been dropped in the water...
...in case of capture.
Unfortunately, you surprised me.
All these papers are about some kind of convoy from France to Germany.
Code name is Tannenbaum.
- Travel reports are a shipment of...
- That's enough.
Thanks.
Colonel.
Come here, colonel.
Oh, Little Joe, give me that brandy, will you?
What for?
- Just give me the brandy.
Kelly, what do you want to give away the good brandy to the Kraut for?
This way, colonel.
Over here.
Sit down on this bench.
I want you to have a drink.
- Under the Geneva Convention...
- This isn't Geneva, colonel.
I just want to have a nice sociable talk with you, that's all.
Go ahead. Drink.
But I will not divulge any further information.
Drink.
You idiot. Hold it.
Come on, cover me.
Mitchell.
- Mitchell?
Yeah?
Big Joe.
All right, you stay here.
- All right, where is he?
- Inside.
Captain?
Yeah, who is it?
It's me, Big Joe. Where are you?
I'm in here.
- What are you doing there, sir?
- I'm checking out the motor.
The motor? What for?
We' re pulling out. I want to see if this boat's worth taking back to the base.
What about Nancy?
Third Army's taking over.
We go into reserve.
When they take Nancy, we go back in the line.
Oh, wow. I don't think you have the welfare of your men at heart.
Now, look, this is a big town, with a lot of passionate broads...
...great restaurants, feather beds in rooms with hot water.
Look, captain, we've been rained on, pushed on, bombed on...
...mortared on by Mulligan all the way from the Normandy Beachhead.
I'm aware of that problem, sergeant.
You've been aware of that problem ever since we got out of the water at Omaha.
Look, why is it that every time we get to a town like Nancy...
...these guys with the clean uniforms and the ties...
...get to ride in the trucks into town and make their pitch?
The general says we pull out, so we pull out.
Look, captain.
You can't let them do this.
I gotta get my men near broads before they start freaking out with each other.
I'm aware that that situation might be developing.
Think I could get this in the hold of a B-17?
We' re point section to the whole damn Army.
- Nancy's our town, captain. Yeah.
Hey, Joe.
There's a company of Germans starting to push.
Relax, I'll be with you in a minute.
Captain.
We got it all figured out.
We even got a guide.
All we have to do is get in there.
Well, there's a couple of German divisions say you can't.
So we need a little help.
The help I need is to get this yacht out of here.
Get back to the barn. I'll do it myself.
Hey, look, captain, you're supposed to be in charge of this outfit.
You' re doing such a good job.
Why should I get in your way?
Oh, God.
Hey, Cowboy.
Got a report that three tanks are coming up the road. I suggest you get activated.
Hold her down there a bit, Willard.
The corporal's trying to tell us something.
Yes, sir. You're telling me what?
There are three tanks coming up the road.
I suggest you get activated.
Oh, now, come on, pal.
Ain't you got any Shermans?
We've been polishing these things for two days.
If we take them out there in that rain, they' re gonna rust up on us.
Come on, don't give me a hard time.
Get off your ass, and get out there.
Yes, sir. I didn't mean nothing.
I was just trying to tell you how we're feeling, ain't that right, Willard? Yee-haw!
Hold the ground at all costs.
We' re a reconnaissance company.
It's not our job to hold the ground.
That's an Infantry job.
We' re supposed to go out and find someplace...
...look at it and tell you what the situation is.
I can tell you what the situation is.
It stinks.
It's wet, it's cold, and we're under heavy fire.
Yes. Yes.
Are they sending up anything to support us?
They say they haven't got anything.
We've been ordered to hold.
Hold. With what?
- That's what I told them.
You think we ought to pull out?
You think we ought to pull out?
I don't know. Better wait for Big Joe.
Corporal, those aren't Mulligan's mortars coming anymore.
Those are German 88s.
Much as I like Big Joe, I don't want to spend the rest of the war in a prison camp.
Besides which, I'm first-generation Italian, they'd shoot me as a traitor.
The indications are the Germans are coming and we're not gonna stop them.
With your permission I'm gonna pull the vehicle to the other side of the canal.
Yeah, go on.
Penn, Fisher. Get that damn thing out of here.
Okay, everybody.
We' re pulling out on the double.
Move that stretcher.
Goddamn it, Cowboy.
I don't know what you was talking about.
There ain't three tanks. There's about 20.
- Ain't that right, Willard?
Damn right.
Get that thing to the other side of the canal, you maniac.
Well, that's what we was figuring on doing. Ha-ha-ha.
Kelly, come on, we' re going.
You' re coming, ain't you?
- Go on ahead.
- All right, all right, good luck.
Okay, Penn, let's go.
Colonel.
How many more bars of gold like this do you have in that convoy?
No, no, come on, speak English, colonel, come on.
How many bars like this in your trucks?
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen what?
Thousand.
Fourteen thousand?
Whoo.
Colonel, whereabouts is your convoy right now?
Where are your trucks?
- Clermont.
- In Clermont. Clermont?
Is the gold still in the trucks?
Whereabouts? Whereabouts is the gold?
In the bank. It is a bank.
Colonel. Wake up, wake up.
What about support units?
- Support units?
- Yeah, tanks.
Come on, tanks. Stuff like that.
Tanks.
Three Tiger tanks.
What about infantry?
What about infantry, colonel?
- Did you hear from headquarters?
- We've been ordered to hold.
I'll tell them when to hold.
The Third took over one hour ago.
- We're pulling out of here.
- Great.
- Where's Maitland?
- He's salvaging a yacht.
A yacht?
- A yacht.
- I'll see you about 10 miles down the road.
Wait a minute.
- Is everybody across the bridge?
- Kelly's in the barn with that colonel.
- Did you tell him we're pulling out?
- We told him. He's crazy.
Tell Mulligan to give me three minutes and then lay all the mortar into that barn.
- Understand?
- If you say so.
You wait here.
Mulligan.
Come on, colonel. Come on.
Get up and sit right here.
Kelly. Half the German Army's coming up the road.
In a few minutes, Mulligan's gonna drop
10 tons of mortar on this joint.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Looking after the colonel.
Shoot him and let's get the hell out of here.
- Shoot him, we don't get the gold.
- What gold?
The gold that's in a bank
25 miles east of Nancy, that's what.
Mulligan, I said three minutes.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Kelly? You okay, Kelly?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Come on, you nut.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Fisher. Petuko. Come on, we're moving out. Moving out.
Moving out. Babra. Come on. Move it.
Get in, we' re pulling out.
Kelly, you nut. Come on.
Wait a minute, will you?
Will you wait a minute?
Listen to me a second.
It's not me, I tell you. It's not me.
I can't tell one shell from another. They all look alike. They all look alike, Kelly.
If it was me, if I could tell, would I be here?
Would I be here?
I wouldn't be here, Kelly.
I'd be in the States checking out the duds.
I'd be out with all those broads.
- I'd be working in a factory.
- Relax.
Wait a minute. We've got to have a little understanding around here.
How the hell do we ever get any understanding around here, Kelly?
- Relax.
- You got...
Mulligan, I just want to make a proposition to you.
A proposition?
Well, is it dirty, or just illegal?
Well, I want you to set up a barrage for me.
I want you to lay down a barrage for me, Mulligan.
Grid section 7, right here at these crossroads.
Yeah, well, I gotta have a signed operations order from the C.O.
I need an authorization.
You see, that's just the problem, Mulligan.
We don't have an authorization.
You don't have a...
Well, Kelly, without an authorization,
I can't help you.
I told you I had a proposition, Mulligan.
That's just what I meant.
A proposition.
Yeah. Well, uh...
Why?
Why what?
Why...?
Why, uh... Why not? Heh.
You won't forget me now, will you?
Why, no. I won't forget, Kelly.
You' re a good man, Mulligan.
Yeah, Kelly.
Come on. Come on.
Screw you, Mac.
Come on, move it.
Up yours, baby.
Hey, hey, come on, get it out of there.
Come on.
Hey, come on. Come on, come on, move it.
Come on. All right, come on, you guys.
Clear it out.
Come on, get the horse out of here.
Get on the side, will you? Come on.
Move it out, come on now.
Move it, move it.
Keep it going, boys. Move it through.
All right, keep it going. Let's go.
Come on.
A message from Captain Maitland.
- Did you read it?
- Yeah.
- What's it say?
- He wanted you to read it, Joe.
Take the underwear off your head, huh?
Enough is enough.
We've been ordered to pull back.
We've been ordered to pull back.
Yeah, I heard.
All right.
We've been ordered back to map reference 473, so let's move it.
But my hair is still in curlers.
That's telling them, Willard.
Come on, let's move it out.
Hey, Joe, what about Nancy?
Pack it up, let's go.
Move them out, will you, corporal?
Where have you been?
- Checking a few things out.
- Like what?
I'm going after that gold, Joe.
That's what I thought.
Do you want in?
Do I want in?
Let me tell you something.
Let me make it nice and clear.
I got a job to do and that's to get you guys to Berlin without getting killed.
We've been at the front end of this war all the way.
If you whisper one word about the gold to these guys...
...I'm gonna have you bounced so fast your feet won't touch the ground.
- Now, do you understand that, Kelly?
- Yeah. Yeah, I understand.
You'd better fix up some transfer papers for me, because I'm going.
With you or without you.
Okay.
Give me a hand down there.
What a bunch of shit this is.
Okay, sergeant, everything's secure up here. I'm coming down now.
Hi, captain.
Sergeant, do you think I can get this yacht to Paris by Sunday?
You didn't bring me to this farmhouse to talk about this boat again?
I worked a deal with headquarters. I've got three days' rest for you and the men.
Make sure they have a good time.
I gotta get this yacht to Paris and pick up things for the general.
- And where do we spend this vacation?
- Right here, sergeant.
Are you kidding?
I'm not kidding. With a little imagination, you can fix this place up.
Lay out a baseball diamond.
Run the water into the house.
Special service is coming by with some magazines and paperbacks.
We' re 10 miles from the nearest town.
There's no action.
That's the beautiful thing about this location. It's quiet.
Get yourselves a suntan, a little rest.
In three days we're back in the line.
Hey, captain.
- We're all ready to move out.
- Yeah, I'm coming. Go ahead.
There's no booze, there's no broads, there's no action.
Another thing. Don't fool around with the women, their husbands carry guns.
And don't forget, the penalty for looting is death.
Loot what? There's nothing here to loot.
I'll be back in three days.
"Get yourself a suntan and get some rest. "
He's gotta be out of his mind.
But how does he get away with it?
That's what I'd like to know.
Very simple.
The general's his uncle, that's how.
There's a girl with a heart
As big as...
- Crapgame?
What do you want?
I want to talk to you for a couple minutes.
What about?
I have this deal I've been working on.
I thought you might be interested in helping me out.
What kind of deal?
A private deal.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, Harry, go get yourself a haircut.
I hear Maitland's got himself a yacht and taking it to Paris.
That's right.
No money in yachts.
What does he want a yacht for?
Who cares, as long as it keeps him out of our hair for a few days?
Okay, Kelly.
What is it? What is it you want?
Well, I want 15 Thompsons, two. 30 caliber machine guns...
...two bazookas, two field radios...
...and supplies and ammunition to last a platoon of men in the field for three days.
- Oh. That all?
- Nope.
I want the Intelligence report for this whole sector...
...and I need them in the next two hours.
That's nice. What's in it for me?
- A piece of the action.
- What kind of action?
This kind of action.
Hello, Izzy? Yeah, it's me, it's me.
Listen, get me a quotation for gold on the Paris market.
Yeah, now, and hurry it up.
How much more where this came from?
Fourteen thousand bars.
Fourteen thousand bars? Ha, ha.
Fourteen thousand.
Hey, sweetheart, have yourself a bottle of booze, you're beautiful.
Fourteen thousand bars.
Zadda-bow-bow.
That's beautiful. Where is it?
In a bank.
In a bank?
You' re getting pretty ambitious, aren't you?
I mean, to think you can blow a bank and get away with it?
It's behind enemy lines.
Behind enemy lines.
Yeah. That could be the perfect crime.
Hello? Yeah. Yeah, Izzy.
Right. Right, I got you.
Let's see. Seven carry the two, gold, 54.
Hm. $1.6 million.
What else will you need?
You could probably use some armor.
What are you doing up there?
- Hey, Crapgame.
- Who the hell's that?
His name's Oddball.
I got three Shermans outside.
Yeah? What outfit?
Right now I don't have any outfit.
Who's your commanding officer?
He got decapitated by an 88 about six weeks ago.
But don't say you're sorry.
He's been trying to get us killed ever since we landed at Omaha Beach.
It's terrible.
He hasn't reported him dead yet.
You see, I've been collecting his whiskey.
We see our role as essentially defensive in nature.
While our armies are advancing so fast...
...and everyone's knocking themselves out to be heroes...
...we are holding ourselves in reserve...
...in case the Krauts mount a counteroffensive which threatens Paris...
...or maybe even New York.
Then we can move in and stop them.
But for $1.6 million...
...we could become heroes for three days.
A Sherman can give you a very nice edge.
Where are these Shermans?
They' re outside.
Come on, I'll show them to you.
These are my boys.
And these are your tanks, huh?
- Yep.
- Yeah.
I mean, don't let the dirt and the rust hang you up.
We like to give the impression that we're just out of action.
Badly in need of a period of rest and reorganization.
That way nobody bugs us.
Come on, look at the engine.
This engine's been modified by our mechanical genius here, Moriarty.
Right?
Whatever you say, babe.
These tanks are faster than any other tanks in the European theater of operations.
Forwards or backwards.
See, man, we like to feel that we can get out of trouble quicker than we got into it.
Any other secret weapons?
Yeah. I mean, like, you see, all the tanks we come up against...
...are bigger and better than ours.
So that all we can hope to do is, like, scare them away.
This gun is an ordinary 76 millimeter...
...but we added this piece of pipe onto it and the Krauts think, like, uh...
...maybe it's a 90 millimeter.
We got our own ammunition.
It's filled with paint.
When we fire it, it makes pretty pictures.
It scares the hell out of people.
We got a loudspeaker here and when we go into battle, we play music very loud.
It kind of...
...calms us down.
Come on inside for a minute.
If I hear any more threats against Maitland's life.
If I hear any more wild talk about going to headquarters and killing the general.
Or raping nurses at the field hospital.
I'm gonna strangle the guy with my bare hands.
Now, all good things come to those who wait.
We' re gonna have a lot of fun here.
Aren't we, Cowboy?
- You can bet your boots on that, partner.
- Sergeant, partner.
- Right, Sarge.
- All right.
Joe?
- Yeah.
I think I've got the crabs.
We' re gonna boil our laundry.
We' re gonna set up a little shower area...
...so we can wash our little bodies.
Right, Barbara?
- Babra.
Shut up.
Shave.
A little wine, women and song.
A little chiquita for you, Petuko.
It's gonna take time to get organized...
...but I want that farmhouse to look like a nightclub. Little Joe.
I want you to set up a bar.
We ain't got no booze.
"We ain't got no booze. "
Well, we' re going to get some booze.
I'm gonna go down to Battalion...
...see if I can lay my hands on some dirty movies and when I come back...
...I want that farmhouse not only clean, but completely decorated.
Do you understand that?
All right, corporal, fall them out.
Let's get moving.
$16 million.
Kelly, I think I made a slight mistake.
It's not 1.6 million, it's $16 million.
- What a bundle.
Yeah, all right.
We' re gonna need plenty of gasoline on this trip.
You can handle getting it through enemy lines?
- Just name the place, baby.
Okay.
Right here. Grid section B.
Tonight at 2100 hours.
No good, man. The boys have got something special on tonight.
Are you nuts?
What's more important than $16 million?
You come around tonight, Crapgame, and we'll show you.
Okay.
Tomorrow night, then.
Along this road, same hour.
We'll be there.
- If you' re late, we move out without you.
- If we're late, it's because we' re dead.
What about Big Joe?
You handle the supplies,
I'll take care of Big Joe.
I'm going along to protect my investment.
You don't trust me.
A firm financial mind should be behind an enterprise such as this.
There could be a bonus. Besides,
Switzerland's only 100 miles away.
I don't want anybody getting lost.
Now, look, I don't want half the Army in on this deal.
Don't want any friends or friends of friends.
I want to keep it a tight little unit.
Right, Oddball?
Oh, yeah, man. I mean, like...
No sweat, you know?
I'll pick you up in about an hour.
You can hang onto that bar of gold as a deposit.
Who is that guy, Crapgame?
Oh. His name's Kelly.
Used to be a lieutenant.
Pretty good, too, until they gave him orders to attack the wrong hill.
Wiped out half a company of GI's.
Somebody had to get the blame, and he got picked.
Oh, man, I don't like officers.
Neither does he, so relax.
Get me Hogan in Intelligence.
- Hey, Crapgame.
- Yeah?
You mind I take this bar of gold and show it to the boys?
No, not at all. Just remember where you found it. Bring it back here.
You' re a good boy, Crapgame.
Something's wrong with him.
Hello, Hogan? It's Crapgame.
I got you the scotch and the nylons you wanted.
Yeah.
Do I ever fail you?
You better believe it. Never miss.
Listen...
...I, uh, got a little favor to ask of you.
Will you stop crying,
I haven't even asked you yet.
What's the matter with you?
You wait here, padre.
I warned you, if you started anything,
I'd bust you out.
If you transfer me, Joe...
...you have to transfer every man in this outfit.
I told you to lay off these guys.
Take it easy.
Kelly's got the whole thing figured.
Who invited you, Hustler?
- He did.
Hey, Joe.
It's a snap.
16 million just waiting to be picked up.
Did he forget to tell you it's behind enemy lines?
- I told them.
Yeah?
Did you tell them how to get through and cover 30 miles to Clermont?
- I told them.
- Then tell me.
Listen, Kelly's got it figured pretty good.
Listen?
This guy's gonna get you all killed.
We' re getting killed now, pal, for $50 a month.
Damn right.
What good is a bonus gonna do when you're dead?
The risk is the same we've been taking since the beaches.
Only then you didn't have a choice, now you do.
Three days from now we're going back into the line, Joe.
But this time we're doing it for ourselves.
Kelly's even got us armor support.
What armor?
Three Shermans from the 321 st.
Who's in command?
It's a top-line outfit.
I personally recommend these guys.
You butt out. The only time you come out of the ground is when you smell a profit.
I'm coming out now because Kelly has the perfect caper.
For you it's a vacation. Six days out of seven you're behind the lines.
We' re at the broken end of a bottle all the time, so you butt out.
Who's in command?
- Guy named Oddball.
- Oddball? He's a freak.
He's got three Shermans all ready to go.
What guarantee is that?
He's ready to go? He's a nut.
Well, we' re all nuts or we wouldn't be here.
Hey, look.
Let me tell you guys something.
There's certain rules and regulations governing the fighting of a war.
And the first one is that you never stick your neck out for nobody.
Unless you're some kind of a hero type.
And I haven't seen any hero types around here lately.
Talking's not gonna do any good, Joe.
These men are all going.
And who's gonna lead them?
If you don't, I will.
Just listen to Kelly for a minute, Joe.
He's got it all sewed, man.
The route, the timing, the supplies, everything.
Sure.
What do you say, corporal?
Oh, I don't know, Joe.
I figure if I got to go, it might just as well be this trip as the next one.
- Penn?
- I'm for it.
How about it, Cowboy?
I reckon I'm gonna have to go along with it, Joe.
They' re all for it, Joe.
What happens when Maitland finds out we're not here?
He'll figure we've been sent back to the front lines.
Man, he never knows where we are anyway.
Okay, show me what you've got.
The road's 10 yards beyond those trees. Let me look at that map, will you?
What happens if they put up road blocks?
Doesn't matter. All that matters is Mulligan being on time.
Mulligan is on time.
On time and on target.
And he ain't ever been that yet.
Well, there's always a first time.
I figure the town is about a quarter of a mile straight ahead.
- What happens if it isn't there?
- It better be. I went through it last night.
Only got a few minutes left, so let's get moving.
Stick close to me, huh?
I don't want to be waiting on anyone.
We'll be there, Kelly.
All right. Move out, Cowboy.
Ooh. That nut has got to be nuts.
Everything all right, Kelly?
- Everything's all right.
You sure you got the time straight with Mulligan?
Yeah, I got the time straight with Mulligan.
Whether Mulligan can tell time or not is another question.
Fire.
That crazy Mulligan's dropping them all over the place.
You mother.
- Joe. Come on.
- Shut up, you pain in the ass.
This man is the man I have on my mind today.
I'll tell you who he is.
This is my opposite number.
General Bogel, commanding the Second German Armored Division.
When I look at that face,
I can read that character.
This guy's a loser.
Here I am sitting in his headquarters.
I'm drinking his scotch.
Hell, I've even got one of his broads hanging around here somewhere.
The guy's a born loser...
...but you, gentlemen, have not buried him yet.
You call yourselves leaders of men?
They' re putting up strong resistance.
Come on, Roach.
I flew over the battlefield this morning.
I could march a divisional dress parade with band music right through their line.
- What about our flanks, sir?
- Aw, the hell with your flanks.
How many times have I got to tell you?
Forget about your flanks.
There's still a half a Panzer division between here and Nancy.
Without gas. Without gas, gentlemen.
They' re getting gas, sir.
It's coming up at night.
- How?
By truck.
The Air Force has got my orders to blow every bridge in this sector out of existence.
They' re doing it and the Germans are rebuilding the bridges every night.
We' re supposed to blow them up again in the daytime.
- Get me those aerial photographs.
- Right, sir.
General, last night someone gave orders to redirect our mortar fire...
...against some damn crossroads.
Listen, Roach. I don't want any excuses out of you, you hear me?
All I want is to know why this loser of a general is keeping me the hell out of Nancy.
Sir, we haven't got the supplies.
It's just a matter of logistics.
Logistics?
Yes, sir.
We've got logistics coming out of our ears.
What we need is fighting spirit.
The will to win.
Where are those aerial photographs?
I'm sorry. They don't seem to be here.
They don't what?
I can't locate them, sir.
Eh...
...did you lose my aerial photographs?
Well... It looks to me like there ain't no bridges still up.
What's this here?
It's a bridge.
Looks like some kind of railroad bridge, huh?
- Beautiful.
Yeah.
Even if we make that...
...we've still got a river to cross later on.
Right over there.
Let Kelly worry about that. Our problem is getting through German lines.
- Right?
- Right.
How?
It's a railroad bridge, ain't it?
- Yeah.
Well, then, beautiful.
We swing down onto the railroad tracks and right over the mother bridge.
"And over the mother bridge. " Sure.
Suppose the bridge ain't there?
Oh, man.
Don't hit me with them negative waves so early in the morning.
Think that bridge will be there and it will be there.
It's a mother, beautiful bridge and it's gonna be there.
Okay?
Okay, chief.
Okay.
Mount up.
How many, Grace?
Eight.
Penn?
Seven.
How many, Kelly?
Uh, three's fine.
Cowboy?
Oh, about six and I figure about eight loose.
How about you, Willard?
About the same.
How many clips did you use last night?
- About eight.
- Eight.
You' re trigger-happy, Gutkowski.
Here's two more.
Take it easy, okay?
Take it easy.
Want some K-rations, Crapgame?
No, thanks, kid.
I could use some water.
Do you got any water?
Mm, okay.
I'm gonna get some water, okay, kid?
Hey, uh, who are you writing to?
Your mother?
Yeah.
- Do you write often?
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?
- Indianapolis.
- Do you miss your mother?
- Yeah.
Good talking to you, kid.
Hey, Kelly.
Kelly?
Big Joe wants to see you over at the command jeep.
Something wrong?
Yeah, just a few little things, Kelly.
According to this map...
...we got a river to cross before we get into this town of yours.
Yeah, well, there's a bridge right here.
Six miles out.
There was a bridge.
The Air Corps knocked every bridge out of that river months ago.
Unh-unh. Reports have the Air Corps knocking them out by day...
...and the Germans rebuilding them by night.
All we have to do is get there tomorrow at dawn and we've got ourselves a bridge.
How about the German Army? Do you think they'd mind us crossing their bridge?
Probably.
You know something, Kelly?
I think you're crazy.
Better yet, I think I'm crazy.
How did I let you talk these guys into this?
Push 30 miles behind enemy lines, take a bridge held by Germans...
...then go into a town that we don't know how many German soldiers are guarding.
I figure there's between 30 and 40 troops in that town.
All right. How did you figure that?
Well, uh, it's of no military importance.
It's not big enough for a garrison.
You still didn't answer the question, Kelly.
How did you figure 30 or 40 men?
Because that's the normal amount of support for three Tiger tanks.
Tigers?
Where the hell did the Tigers come from?
That's why we have Oddball and his Shermans.
- Does he know about the Tigers?
- Not yet, no.
You bet your sweet ass he doesn't.
Or he'd still be on that funny farm of his.
He may be nuts, but he's not crazy enough to put Shermans up against Tigers.
Once these things get rolling...
...they're gonna blow that whole town to pieces, including us, Kelly.
You're too smart to let that happen, Joe.
You'll figure us a way in and out of that town.
I know you've got a good head for tactics.
Yeah? And I intend to keep it right here on my shoulders, Kelly.
With these Tigers, this operation goes above and beyond the call of duty.
That's right, Joe.
16 million above and beyond.
Hey, look, Kelly.
You' re pressing these guys' luck.
They've only got so much of it left.
It's a long, long way to Berlin.
And they're gonna need every inch of that luck before this cockamamie war is over.
Cover!
Come on, on the double.
Let's get the equipment out of the trucks.
On the double, move it out. Here.
Cover. Take cover.
Hey. Hey.
That idiot's one of ours.
Holy crap.
Oh... Our hero.
Man, this is crazy, isn't it, Willard?
Get the number of that plane?
Who you gonna file a complaint with?
- Move it out, move it out.
Yeah, yeah.
- Still think we can make it, wise guy?
- We can still try.
Well, Oddball better show up, Kelly.
That's all I gotta say, he'd better show up.
Move it out.
All right, how is it?
Shot.
- There's a hole right through the cylinder.
- How about the radio equipment?
- The pack radio is okay. The rest has had it.
- Pick it up and take it with you.
- I got your equipment, Joe.
- Bring it.
I told you. We should've never gone in on this deal.
- Well, you never told me.
- Yes, I did.
This why we pay taxes?
To be bombed by our own Air Force?
- Damn right.
- Hey, Kelly. Kelly.
What do we do now?
Pick up our equipment and get out of here before a German patrol comes along.
Oh, that's great.
Let's move all that stuff up to the wall, on the double.
- Everybody all right?
- I think so.
- What happened, Joe?
- What happened?
- Where the hell have you been?
- I had to go.
We all have to go.
Come on. We've got 20 miles to walk and nine hours to walk it in, so move it out.
Big Joe? Do I gotta carry all this equipment...
...this satchel charge and this. 30 caliber machine gun, too?
Give the. 30 caliber to the Hustler.
He wants to be a hero.
Here you are, old buddy. Ha-ha-ha.
Thanks. Get yourself a bucket of grits.
All right, corporal, let's go.
Move them out. Move it out, Penn.
- Yeah, yeah, move them out.
- It's a long way.
All right, thank you. Move it out.
Kelly, get on the point.
How come you got me elected to carry this?
You wanted in on this?
Then learn to carry your own load.
Come on, move it out.
Yeah, up yours.
Take it easy, take it easy.
Take it easy. Okay, hold it. Hold it.
Looks like we've got a military installation up ahead.
So make it the same deal as before.
We'll go into a triangular formation.
I'll go down the slot.
Moe, you go down the right flank.
Whiskey, down the left. Keep it tight.
Don't break it up until I give you the word.
Okay, button up and let's go.
The flowers are blooming
It's a beautiful day
There's a girl with a heart
As big as the sky
She's sunshine
And I know why
Fire.
All for the love of sunshine
Fire.
Hit it.
All right, lay four rounds in there heavy.
Come on, move it. Fire.
Hit it.
Fire.
Bring him around hard.
Hit it.
Fire.
Every time I go to town
A boy started kickin' my dog around
It makes no difference if he is a hound
You better stop kickin' my dog around
Go on, Blue
You good dog, you
All right, Petuko.
Right, Joe.
Move them out, corporal.
Let's go, Babra.
Wake up, Gutkowski. Let's go.
Let's go, Kelly.
All right, Hustler, let's go.
Hey, Kelly.
This was your idea. How come we don't go back to our own lines?
It's further back to ours than it is to where we' re going.
I know what, let's surrender. I'm hungry.
Come on.
All right. I buy it.
I'll make it $50 if you carry the machine gun, huh?
You got it on you?
- Don't you trust me?
- No, I don't.
What do you think I am, a vault?
You think I carry money?
I ask you a favor and you don't want to help me?
All I asked you is to carry the machine gun. I'll give you $100.
Do you have it?
No, I don't have it on me.
Shut up.
Ah, you guys keep quiet.
It's still up.
No, it ain't.
You see what sending out them negative waves did, Moriarty?
That ain't my fault, Oddball.
I've done nothing but have good thoughts about that bridge ever since we left.
What happens now?
It looks like we're gonna find ourselves another bridge.
Where are we gonna come up with another bridge?
There you go, more negative waves.
Have a little faith, baby.
Have a little faith.
Now go on, get down into your hole.
Move out.
42nd Engineers. Bridging Unit.
Corporal Roamer speaking.
Hey, Sarge. It's Oddball.
All right, watch my outfit.
Yeah.
Don't try to be funny, Oddball.
What do you want?
I'm telephoning you from a café about 10 miles south of Mesurier.
I wondered if you could do me a favor.
Mesurier?
I got a map here someplace that says we haven't even captured that place already.
Yeah, so I heard.
Everybody seems very friendly.
Look, baby, I'm kind of hung up.
I need about 60 feet of bridge.
How am I supposed to get 60 feet of bridge 10 miles behind the German lines?
I'm about to put you onto something good and you are giving me your problems.
This sector's so screwed, nobody knows where the German lines or our lines are.
I got through with no problem.
I've got a bank back here with 16 million waiting to be picked up. Are you in?
Listen, they haven't got you back in the nut ward again, have they?
Bellamy. For crying out loud.
That is the lousiest, stinking, most awful, stupid joke.
You' re always pulling that stinking, awful, stupid joke.
You don't want in this thing, don't get in.
I cut you out of everything.
I don't need you, 60 feet of bridge,
I can pick up almost anywhere. Schmuck.
All right, all right, all right.
Look, with three tanks, it's easy.
With a 60-foot bridge it's something else.
I need support units, Oddball.
I need at least 100 guys.
Where do I find 100 men, just like that?
Eighteen miles to...
Jerks.
I couldn't have blown 13, 18, 14, switch the other guys. Aah.
- Joe.
- Shut up.
We've walked into a minefield.
- All right, who bought it?
- It's Grace.
Joe.
There's a road right up here at the edge of the field.
You mark that spot and you head for the road.
Everybody.
Take out your bayonets...
...and move towards Kelly.
Corporal.
Move the men down slowly.
- Mitchell?
Yo!
You pick up Grace's B.A.R. and head this way.
Jonesey, for Christ's sake, stand still.
Corporal?
Go see if Grace is still alive.
Jonesey, will you get the hell down?
- Looks all right up here.
- Right.
All right, you guys, keep it moving. Stay careful.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, I found one.
What kind is it?
The kind that blows up.
How the hell do I know what kind it is?
Mark the spot and keep moving, Hustler.
I'll mark it.
Gutkowski, get down there on that bend and keep an eye out.
Okay, bring the B.A.R.
Penn, get that. 30 caliber set up the other side of the wall.
Right.
I could've been in the States playing Ping-Pong, volleyball...
...plenty of broads.
Who the hell needs all this?
I'm gonna get my knife and get the hell out of here.
Damn lousy equipment.
Now I got to lift up this cannon.
Carry it all the way to the front line someplace.
The damn thing is heavier than Kelsey's burgers.
Sure, I'll get a rupture yet with this damn thing.
Move it now.
On the double, across the road.
Go ahead, Babra, stay on Kelly's path all the way.
On the double.
Come on, Hustler. Move it.
It's all safe for you, now.
"Move it. " I hope you have to take the gas pipe. You creep.
- Stay on Kelly's path the whole way.
- Go to hell.
Let's go, Cowboy. Move it.
Come on, Willard. Let's mount up, boy.
Anything we can do for you, corporal?
No, thanks, Cowboy. We're all right.
- Come on, Willard. Hit it.
I'm ready.
Hey. Hey, Kelly.
How did we get talked into this mess?
It took 10 seconds to talk you into this.
But we were supposed to ride, not walk.
Nobody said anything about mines...
...or schlepping this machine gun all over the country.
Quit your bitching and just remember what's at the end of the line.
GUTKOWSKl:
Kelly. Kelly.
Joe, there's a patrol coming in.
All right, Kelly, spread them out across the road.
Move it. Your crabs will leave you now.
Get that gun set up on the other side of the wall.
Move.
Move it, Petuko, move it.
- Don't forget about the broads.
- You horny bastard.
Sergeant? Get the hell out of there.
Corporal. You'll never make it.
We'll cover you from the road.
- Don't move unless they spot you.
- Right. Go on.
Set up the B.A.R. there, Mitchell.
All right, stay down, load up.
Stay down, load up.
Stay down. Stay down, hold your fire.
Fisher. Grenades.
- Let's get out of here. Let's go back.
Take it easy.
It's too late, now.
We' re better off here, anyway.
Get your head down.
Nice and easy.
Stay down.
All right. Get ready.
Hold it.
Fire.
Let's go.
- Jam.
- Clear it.
Let's move it out.
All right, you heard me.
I said, move it out.
Maybe they' re only wounded.
They' re dead, so forget it. Let's move.
Hey.
Hey.
There's a whole column of Shermans coming over the hill.
Go get your packs.
Pick up your equipment.
Go on down and load up.
Ready.
Fire.
I thought you said three Shermans.
Those nuts have brought half the Army with them.
Okay, keep a move on.
Let's keep on coming.
Come on. Okay, move on out.
Are you ready for this?
Split how many ways, stupid?
Come on, Willard.
What is this, huh? What is this, a ball game? Who are these guys?
They' re my friends, Crapgame.
Friends? Where'd you find them?
Here and there.
- There's a bunch of refugees over there.
- It's a band.
A band? What do we need a band for?
Have a little faith, Crapgame.
They' re beautiful people.
Kid, pull yourself together.
We ain't in the middle of Central Park.
Oddball.
How do you figure on moving through enemy terrain with a column a mile long?
Easy. We can fight. We got an army.
Those freaks? That ain't an army, it's a circus.
Take it easy, Big Joe.
Some of these people have got sensitive feelings.
- Who's the guy in charge?
- I am.
What's the deal with the gold?
Any man who gets to the town and hits the bank, gets an equal share.
But don't try to cross us.
There's gonna be trouble.
- Who's going to make it, boy?
- I am.
- Well, get out and start it.
Take it easy, big mouth.
You get out of here.
Everybody else up on the tanks.
Come on, let's move out.
- Don't double-cross us.
- Any double-crossing will be your fat lip.
- Get moving.
Shut up.
Everybody up on that tank. Let's go.
Kelly, we're not going with those cowboys, are we?
We got $16 million up for grabs and we're not gonna let those clods beat us to it.
- Now, let's get moving.
- Yeah, yeah.
I say, Booker? Booker.
Yes, sir?
The old man was just on the line.
He says I've broken through a long and entire front.
Why wasn't I told?
I don't know, sir.
You' re the communications officer, ain't you?
You' re supposed to be able to communicate.
Who's broken through and how far have they gone?
Well, no one has, sir.
It seems someone's found a hole in the right flank.
They' re trying to push elements of the 321 st and the 35th into it.
"Seems," Booker?
"Elements of the 321 st and 35th"?
Who's pushing them in there, and where the hell are they?
I don't know, sir.
I'm coming down there, Booker.
What's the sense of a communications officer who can't communicate?
Communication? He's more like a damn military censor.
I'm back from Paris.
I got everything you wanted.
All I want is to know whether we have broken through or not.
It's hard to say for certain, sir.
Nothing's been confirmed yet.
We've intercepted some signals...
...that suggest some kind of action at a bridge near Clermont.
- Is that Clermont, Booker?
- Yes, sir.
Then why in the hell didn't you say so?
That's 30 miles beyond their lines.
You got them on the radio?
Yes, sir, but it's hard to pick them up clearly, sir...
...this time in the morning.
Something to do with the ionosphere.
Get the ionosphere the hell off the air and get them on.
Get out of there.
Do something else. Let me in.
- What's the frequency?
- 300 KC, sir.
You' re not gonna find them easy to follow.
- They're using some kind of code.
- What kind of code?
Words like "bank heist, crapgame, big joe, little joe, oddball... "
Hey, can anybody get rid of that machine gun for me?
- There, yes, sir, there. That's it, that's them.
- Where?
There. Right on 300, sir. Right there.
There they are, sir. Those are the signals we've been picking up.
Shut up and let me listen to what they're saying?
Put Kelly on. Over.
Wilco. Over.
Oddball, this is Kelly.
Hey, Kelly, what the hell's going on out there, man?
It's cleared of infantry. What do you hear from those other two tanks? Over.
No chance, man. They've both had it.
One's in the river, the other's burning.
Yeah, I can see them from here. Over.
Where's Big Joe?
Over on the other side. Get off the line, I'll get in touch with him.
Fire. Okay. Over and out.
Kelly to Big Joe. Kelly to Big Joe. Over.
Kelly, it's Crapgame.
What's happening there? Over.
They' re dropping artillery all over the place. That's what's happening.
Where's Big Joe? Over.
He's not here. He's pinned down under the bridge. Over.
- Well, get him for me. Over.
Okay.
Damn. Are we losing them?
We just had them good a minute ago.
I'm doing it, Booker.
Quiet.
What do you want me to do with this?
Get the hell out of here.
We've got the game on.
Kelly, this is Big Joe.
It's pretty clear over here, except for the artillery.
The bridge is too far gone to get vehicles across. You can bring the men over by foot.
Get them moving. Over.
Okay, I'll send them over in twos and threes. Out.
Petuko, Willard, drop your packs and take the equipment across the bridge.
Kelly, what did Big Joe say?
Says he's sending them across.
Tell him to hurry up.
It's getting hotter than hell here.
- What's going on?
- We're crossing over.
- You're not crossing over without us.
- Then grab your trucks and come on up.
- That bridge is too badly damaged to hold.
- You want to come, fix it.
Half my equipment's jammed up in the rear.
Un-jam them. We've lost two tanks already.
I'm not sticking around to lose a third.
Listen, we made a deal.
Not with me, you didn't. Here. You talk to Kelly. Cowboy, stay with the truck.
- Right.
Ready?
This is Bellamy for Kelly. Kelly?
We can't use the bridge.
We can't ford the river. The bed's too soft.
So what do we do?
- Go, team, go. Go.
You've got bridging equipment. Over.
That's a five-hour operation.
Can you hold on for five hours? Over.
No, no. Move. On, on. Move.
Bellamy, we're not gonna hold on for five minutes. You can catch up.
Kelly, we're all in this together.
You can't go it alone. Over.
We' re not gonna wait five hours, either.
If you can't keep up, that's your problem.
Now, we're pulling out and we're pushing forward. Over.
Attack. Attack. Attack.
That's the fighting spirit
I was talking about. Listen to that guy.
- If he was a major, he's a colonel now.
Kelly.
This is a Grave Diggers Registration
Unit. We got a stake in this advance, too.
Did you ever hear enthusiasm like that in all your life?
They've even got the damn Grave Diggers.
What the hell am I doing here?
Bonsor. Get me my uniform.
Get on!
Wonder where Cowboy is?
Give me that gun.
Break up that radio.
Faster, faster.
Hurry up, you guys, we haven't got much time.
Get up.
Crapgame, do you like the Army?
Let's go. Let's get out of here.
All right, let's move them out.
- This is it, Penn. We' re on our way, baby.
Cowboy, come on. Hurry up.
Here we go.
Come on.
Come on, Cowboy.
This train's leaving, boy.
Somebody grab that radio.
There you go. Come on, up, up.
Attaboy, come on.
That's it.
Booker, tell General Castle that I want every man in this Army...
...on the road within the hour.
- Yes, sir.
I'm pushing on to the Rhine.
But, sir, Clermont's 30 miles behind enemy lines.
That you, Maitland?
Just back from Paris, sir.
Get my vehicle and driver around here.
Bonsor, you get my box of medals.
I'm gonna decorate every man in this penetration, whoever they are.
They saved the reputation of this entire Army.
You' re supposed to fight this battle.
You don't even know where it is.
I'll tell you where it is. It's 30 miles beyond where you thought it was, Booker.
Come on, now, let's get this Army of mine back in the war.
Will you send that?
Think you ought to wait, let the Army get there?
History waits for no man. I've got an appointment with destiny in Clermont.
Take this weapon, Maitland.
All right, boy. Make this thing fly.
- General, your medals.
- Good luck, sir.
Kelly?
Yeah, Cowboy?
Kelly, we're in the bell tower of the church.
You can see the whole town from up here, almost.
There's not much happening.
I think they're still asleep.
There's three Tigers in the square right down below us.
Do you see anything that looks like it might be a bank?
Yeah, it's got to be this building here to the right of us.
Can you see it from where you are?
They've got two machine guns and guards on the roof.
I don't think I can see much of the center of town from up here.
No, just a lot of rooftops and bombed-out buildings.
Beside the tanks, can you see anything that might house support units?
There's a big brown building right behind the bank with a jeep...
...and two guards and about three trucks.
Hold it.
There's a German officer walking around the bank towards the brown building.
Well, what do you think?
We shouldn't have trouble unless it's with the Tigers.
We can take the machine gunners on the roof from here.
If you can keep them guys busy for a while.
Or maybe we can go down and get a closer look.
No, stay there. Keep an eye out.
See if you can find out where those troops are housed.
Right.
What do you think, Oddball?
It's a wasted trip. Nobody said nothing about locking horns with Tigers.
Look. You just keep those Tigers busy, and we'll take care of the rest.
Ha, ha. The only way I got to keep the Tigers busy is to let them shoot holes in me.
We just want you to keep them interested for a while, that's all.
Man. You guys are crazy.
When we was in the bocage country, we was assaulted by them Tigers.
You know what I mean by "assaulted"?
Well, I mean assaulted.
Why don't you knock it off with them negative waves?
Why don't you dig how beautiful it is out here?
Why don't you say something righteous and hopeful for a change?
Crap.
All right, so it's a beautiful day.
Now, let's get down to cases.
The Tiger is an open-country tank.
We happen to have these in a small town with narrow streets.
- And we do have the element of surprise.
- Yeah.
Look, Kelly, a Tiger has only one weak point. That's its ass.
You gotta hit it point blank and you've gotta hit it from behind.
We do not have the element of surprise.
They'll hear our Detroit motors long before we even get inside that town.
What if I show you a way to get into that town so they don't hear you?
Hey, Oddball?
This is your hour of glory, and you're chickening out.
To a New Yorker like you, a hero is some type of weird sandwich.
Not some nut who takes on three Tigers.
Nobody's asking you to be a hero.
No?
Then you sit up in that turret, baby.
No. Because you're gonna be up there, baby.
And I'll be right outside showing you which way to go.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Crazy. I mean, like, so many positive waves, maybe we can't lose. You're on.
- You guys got anything?
- No, not much.
They just keep coming and going from the brown building behind the bank.
- Cowboy?
Yeah?
In 20 minutes, start ringing that bell.
And keep ringing it as long as you can. Got it?
Right, Kelly.
Five minutes after that bell starts, you get the guards on top of the bank.
Okay, Kelly.
All right, let's move out.
Kelly?
Kelly. Kelly.
- Hold it.
- Hold it.
Cowboy?
Yeah, Kelly, where in the heck are you, man?
We' re just outside of town.
How's it look up there?
Well, it doesn't look too good from here.
They've got all those Tigers fired up down there.
Looks like they're getting ready for some heavy-duty action.
I think we ought to pull out of here, pal.
No, stay right there. What do you think?
That's just routine.
The Tigers turn their engines over for, like, 20 minutes every three, four hours.
Just routine, Cowboy. You stay put.
Routine?
Boy, I sure hope you're right, Kelly.
Our asses are gonna be hanging out up here if you ain't. I'm not kidding.
Nothing's gonna be hanging out.
Now, just relax. Out.
- Sure you're right about those Tigers?
- Sure, I'm right.
If those engines are turning over, we can sneak right up the edge of town.
- Nobody would hear us. Right?
- Right.
Shall I move out?
Good man.
Move out.
Babra.
All right.
Come on.
Hold it.
Stay here, until I signal you.
I'm mounting up, partner.
Now, don't you get lonely up here without me, now, you hear?
All right, let's go.
Switch it on and move it out.
- Hold it.
- Hold it.
Give me that hand radio.
Gutkowski? Gutkow...
The bell's making so damn much noise, he can't hear.
I thought that was what you wanted.
So the Germans can't hear us.
Now, move them out. Slow.
Move out. Slow.
Now.
Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
It's a Mark 6. And we got it by the ass.
Fire.
Aah!
Stay down.
All right, move out.
Let's go.
All right, get out of here.
Moving out.
Crapgame?
Yeah.
Over there.
Come on, you idiot.
Hey. Hey, you jerk. Hey.
Hey, will you knock it off with those cockamamie bells?
Kelly told me to ring them.
I know he told you, but they know we're here already. So, knock it off.
God Almighty. Whoo. Phew.
You guys smell like you fell into a dung heap.
It kind of makes you homesick, don't it?
- It does kind of, don't it, old buddy?
- Yeah. Heh.
Pull it.
- Let's go.
- All right, move out.
All right, ready to turn right.
Turn.
Now, hold it.
Fire.
- Wow.
- That's paint.
Load up.
Okay? Fire.
Hey.
We need explosives to get these open.
This place is built like Fort Knox.
Cowboy, check around and see if there's a back door.
Can you see anything?
There's a big lump in the middle of the floor.
There's a Tiger coming down the street.
Cowboy. Cowboy, come here.
Get ahold of his arm.
Take it easy, boy.
Easy, easy does it.
Don't tell me to take it easy.
You take it easy.
Hi, man.
What are you doing?
I'm drinking wine and eating cheese, and catching some rays. You know?
What's happening?
The tank's broken and they're trying to fix it.
Why aren't you helping them?
Oh, man.
I only ride them,
I don't know what makes them work.
Oh, creeps.
Definitely an anti-social type.
Arf, arf, arf, arf!
That's my other dog imitation.
- Where did he get it?
- Well, he got it right here in the leg.
- Anything else?
- What do you mean?
Ain't that enough for you?
- How do you feel, Hustler?
- Great.
Since when did you give a damn how I felt?
Okay, wise guy, forget it.
Hey, Joe.
- Yeah?
- Come here.
What do you want?
How are things going with the bank?
Nothing.
The Sherman's broken down and nobody's gonna move that Tiger out of the square.
- Then make a deal.
- What kind of a deal?
A "deal" deal.
Maybe the guy's a Republican.
Business is business.
Right?
Okay, big mouth.
Come on, Jonesey.
Get it going. Let's go. Get it going.
Come on, let's go. Get in there.
Come on.
Come on, let's go. Roll it in there.
Bellamy, come on.
We' re almost finished.
- What?
- It's ready.
Right. Okay, let's go.
Let's move it out here.
Come on, bring them around.
Ten-hut!
Where are you from, sergeant?
Jersey City.
Stand up straight when the general speaks to you.
Don't you feel bad about it.
You' re a hell of a soldier, and I just want to shake your hand.
All America's real proud of you today.
All right, come on.
I got a medal here in the jeep for you.
A medal?
16 million bucks, shot.
It's shot, Kelly.
Maybe we can use the fuel pump from that Tiger.
No, it won't work on this motor.
- Mechanical genius.
Oh, man.
Oddball, I can't make it work without the parts no matter how positive I think.
This guy in the Tiger, the least we could do is get him on the radio and talk to him.
Are you crazy?
That guy's gotta be a full fanatic freak.
Otherwise he would've split
20 minutes ago.
Hey, all this guy is doing is guarding the bank like he was told.
Yeah, maybe.
But I wonder if he knows what's in it.
- Cigarette?
No smoke.
The fuel system is rotten.
We have gasoline all over the place.
It's all right.
Hey, look, uh, Max...
...you and us, we' re just soldiers, right?
We don't even know what this war's all about.
All we do is we fight and we die.
And for what?
We don't get anything out of it.
In about a half an hour, the American
Army's gonna be coming down that road.
Why don't you do yourself a big fat favor and get the hell out of here?
I have orders.
This bank isn't to fall into the hands of the American Army.
This bank's not gonna fall in the hands of the American Army.
It's gonna fall in our hands.
You see, we're just a private enterprise operation.
You the American Army.
No, baby, we ain't.
You know what's inside that bank, man?
There's $16 million worth of gold in that bank, sweetheart.
That's about 65 million marks.
And, sergeant...
...all you have to do to have an equal share of this money...
...is crank this turret around and blow a hole in that door.
I told you.
No more payments.
You got it. Hit it.
Come on, Little Joe.
What are you going to do with yours?
Get me a new Hudson with an electric shift.
I'm going to get me a ranch in Texas, with about 10, 20, 35 women...
...and let it go. Ha-ha-ha.
- I told you it'd work, I told you.
- No, you never told me.
- You never told me.
- Come on, Babra, keep it moving.
One Cadillac coming up, Willard.
- No, I'm getting a pickup truck.
Okay, Crapgame, we got our cut,
I'm moving out.
Right. Take it easy, kid.
See you, Big Joe.
Heh. Okay. Stay lucky, you nut.
Mmm. See you, babe.
These are getting heavy.
- Buy you a lot of broads.
- I'll drink to that.
Come on, let's go. Move it out.
Come on, Babra, keep it moving.
We have small car full.
We go now.
Yeah. You take care of yourself now, huh?
Thank you.
Come on, we gotta get out of here.
Cowboy, come on.
Move it.
I got it, let's go.
Hold.
Eh? See? What did I tell you, huh?
Now look, Oddball. The trade for the uniforms I can understand.
But to buy this tank, you gotta be crazy.
It's a mother, beautiful tank.
It's a piece of junk.
The fuel system leaks all over the place.
It's a piece of junk.

Okay, Gutkowski.
You go help with the gold.

Listen, after splitting with Oddball and the Germans we should have 125 boxes.
At $8400 a box.
That's how much?
That's 10,500,000.
Correct. Split 12 ways?
875,000 each.
Very good, Fisher. You win a cookie.
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
I just wanted you to know that we appreciate it very much. All of us.

{5409}{5489}Who's there?
{5559}{5629}Polecat!
{6279}{6384}"Valerie, forgive me."
{6552}{6630}Where are her earrings ?
{6631}{6654}Speak!
{6655}{6689}I lost them, constable.
{6690}{6719}- You lie, Orlik.|- No, I don't.
{6720}{6915}You can't avoid punishment,|I will torture you with water.
{6920}{6963}Orlik!
{6964}{7006}Bend down!
{7007}{7119}I will jump on your back.
{7209}{7251}Hurry up!
{7252}{7327}Scallywag.
{10895}{10971}Grandmom, have the actors arrived ?
{10972}{11038}You should be more concerned that|the missionaries are coming.
{11039}{11096}When?
{11097}{11150}Today or tomorrow.
{11151}{11277}One of them will be living with us.
{11278}{11381}You are not playing with that earring, are you ?
{11382}{11463}I'm not a child anymore, grandmom.
{11464}{11572}Just tonight, you know.
{11699}{11811}At 13 ... as your mother.
{11908}{11985}I'm warning you!
{11986}{12081}Get rid of that ear-rings.
{12082}{12154}Your mother put them away on the day|when she entered the nunnery.
{12155}{12228}Your father was a bishop.
{12229}{12303}As you know, both are now in heaven.
{12304}{12436}Is there some secret in these earrings?
{12437}{12475}Oh no.
{12476}{12579}I got them at this house's auction from some constable.
{12580}{12672}Did you know him?
{13081}{13154}Grandmom, the actors have arrived.
{13155}{13228}But it's just a weding.
{13229}{13329}Hedvika is marrying.
{13673}{13755}Poor Hedvika.
{13772}{13815}Why?
{13816}{13948}She will be a rich farmer's wife.
{14485}{14521}Grandmom!
{14522}{14617}Grandmom, monster!
{14811}{14885}This can't be him.
{14886}{14941}He'd died already.
{14942}{15072}Who are you talking about, grandmom?
{15073}{15169}Go and repeat your piano fingering.
{15170}{15255}O.K. grandmom.
{17480}{17534}"Beautiful maiden.
{17535}{17709}It was me who stole your earrings and|brought them back in your hands again.
{17710}{17835}My uncle, the constable, desires them.
{17836}{17954}He killed my dad and mom and I'm afraid for your destiny.
{17955}{18057}Today will be in church...
{18058}{18150}...today will be in church sermon for maidens.
{18151}{18332}Please leave your dress in summer-house so that|in disguise I could exchange a few words with you.
{18333}{18397}Your unhappy Orlik."
{18398}{18468}Valerie?
{18490}{18560}Valerie?
{18576}{18629}Where are you my child?
{18630}{18700}Valerie?!
{18701}{18771}Valerie?
{18819}{18943}It's time to dress for vesper.
{18944}{19114}Grandmom, may I take with me a leaf of rosemary?
{21621}{21746}Me, God's servant, missionary.
{21776}{21950}I came between you, maidens,|to give you the knowledge and God's vow.
{21951}{22065}Oh maiden, do you know what you are?
{22066}{22154}You are an alabaster handshake.
{22155}{22278}You are an uncut pomegranate.
{22303}{22471}You are the boat of a leaf and an opening rosebud.
{22472}{22694}Rough hand touching your breast would|leave an indelible fingerprint.
{22737}{22828}But I'm with you, my maiden.
{22829}{22976}In guardian angel's place I bow to you.
{23006}{23211}And I bless with this wine, your mouth, your breast, your lap.
{23286}{23347}Amen.
{23348}{23410}Amen.
{23599}{23664}Orlik?
{23673}{23738}Orlik?
{23743}{23808}Orlik?
{24715}{24780}Orlik!
{24828}{24893}Orlik?
{25332}{25434}Valerie, is that you?
{25477}{25551}The monster tortured me hard.
{25552}{25664}Valerie, I want to give you advice.
{25665}{25733}- We are on square.|- I'm sorry.
{25734}{25811}Don't look.
{25825}{25850}Yet?
{25851}{25893}Yet!
{25894}{25946}I'm here.
{25947}{26020}Firstly :
{27538}{27679}Where is the public poor-house, dear child?
{27680}{27780}There, reverend sir.
{27802}{27896}You do act from mercy?
{27897}{27964}Or don't you like me?
{27965}{28055}No reverend sir.
{28132}{28237}Dear me! I please you.
{28334}{28424}You enter first.
{28542}{28640}Go on, don't worry.
{28743}{28811}Please.
{28828}{28925}This is my kingdom.
{29545}{29615}Valerie!
{29657}{29719}Come!
{29729}{29797}Closer.
{29818}{29898}Come closer.
{29995}{30043}Look.
{30044}{30109}Oh no!
{30200}{30326}I know that I don't appeal to you anymore, my Gracian.
{30327}{30450}Only five years ago, when you were here last time...
{30451}{30528}...but now!
{30650}{30720}Go away!
{30735}{30784}I will lash myself.
{30785}{30883}- Grandmom!|- Look!
{31286}{31381}It's only a dream.
{31403}{31545}I'm asleep and everything is a dream.
{31820}{31872}Did he hurt you ?
{31873}{31931}No.
{31982}{32052}He wants you to love him.
{32053}{32125}How could I love him when I am affraid of him?
{32126}{32213}That's just it.
{32290}{32331}Orlik?
{32332}{32366}Orlik!?
{32367}{32414}I'm waiting for you, constable.
{32415}{32485}Damned broker.
{32486}{32573}Hands up, burglar, or I will shoot!
{32574}{32659}Elsa, it's me.
{32690}{32795}Don't you remember me?
{32829}{32899}Richard.
{32930}{33063}I haven't heard my name for ages.
{33157}{33262}Why did you come Richard?
{33263}{33365}I missed you so much.
{33385}{33608}I had never loved another man from that time you seduced me and left.
{33613}{33733}I'm really sorry about that.
{33779}{33865}See how old you are, Elsa!
{33866}{33913}Then you were 17.
{33914}{33989}What would I give to become younger like you.
{33990}{34113}Richard, tell me your secret.
{34125}{34263}I will give you everyting you want.
{34376}{34499}Give me back this house, Elsa!
{34500}{34589}This means to rob Valerie!?
{34590}{34730}You are capable of much worse deeds!
{34833}{34878}Yes, I will.
{34879}{35042}Well, let's write a small business agreement.
{35063}{35151}You will be young and beautiful again.
{35152}{35274}It will happen tonight, on the stingy farmer's wedding night.
{35275}{35360}You are devil!
{35395}{35450}This pearl will save you.
{35451}{35510}Orlik, where is Valerie?
{35511}{35588}- I kidnapped her.|- Where?
{35589}{35644}To the church tower.
{35645}{35820}- Au!|- Come to me, ninny! You will take me there.
{37348}{37411}Pray.
{37674}{37754}Do you hear?
{37872}{38065}For the third time bells had tolled and went quiet again.
{38109}{38211}The food is excelent.
{38255}{38477}One enjoys any meal, especially after things|I've seen when I was with the cannibals.
{38478}{38547}There we saved a young black girl.
{38548}{38700}- She was very beautiful.|- What happened to her, reverend?
{38701}{38899}We took her to our tent and|tried to convert her to our faith.
{38900}{38963}She showed a great talent.
{38964}{39043}And did she become really a nun?
{39044}{39116}Unfortunately no.
{39117}{39236}- We lost her in a certain french port.|- Martha, where is wine?
{39237}{39324}One day I will tell you what happened to her.
{39325}{39507}She fell into bad indecency and|committed a sin against 6th commandment.
{39508}{39650}- I will give you advice in that respect, dear child.|- Thank you, reverend.
{39651}{39784}Your father bishop was a gentleman.
{39785}{39953}He fainted during bride's confession and|all the beautiful women adored him.
{39954}{40022}I will tell you more sometime.
{40023}{40072}And how many children did he have?
{40073}{40191}You and a boy called Orlik.
{40217}{40281}Orlik!?
{40282}{40345}What happened?
{40346}{40434}I've got a headache. May I go and lie down?
{40435}{40474}Dinner is still not over.
{40475}{40538}Excuse me.
{40539}{40642}Will you touch the glasses with us?
{40643}{40682}I have never drunk wine.
{40683}{40793}Make an exception today.
{40886}{41004}In a memory of dead bishop.
{41169}{41234}Orlik?
{41301}{41366}Orlik?
{42301}{42376}I want to talk to you my child.
{42377}{42429}Now reverend?
{42430}{42531}There is no better time for contemplation.
{42532}{42605}How beautiful breasts you have.
{42606}{42699}Go away reverend.
{42745}{42870}What I want from you is sweet.
{42955}{43057}You are so beautiful!
{43072}{43166}- You are so gorgeous!|- Go away.
{43167}{43242}You are so fascinating!
{43243}{43456}I will resist you, you coward.|You will responsible for my death.
{43627}{43725}What have you done?
{45104}{45172}Signed.
{45368}{45478}My house is again yours.
{45514}{45651}And now we will wait till midnight.
{45664}{45762}At the wedding bed.
{46778}{46868}Come, it's time.
{46964}{47056}Pity of my hopes.
{47237}{47327}Come, it's time.
{47588}{47665}I'm so old.
{47680}{47765}I will be too.
{48587}{48697}- Do you love me?|- Yes.
{49224}{49329}Not one drop of blood.
{49335}{49382}Don't cry.
{49383}{49498}You look old when you cry.
{49949}{50019}Valerie?
{50034}{50104}Valerie?
{50178}{50243}Orlik!
{50473}{50538}Orlik.
{50569}{50639}Valerie!
{50808}{50875}Please.
{50981}{51036}- Don't look that way.|- What way?
{51037}{51114}Kneel down!
{51162}{51239}Kneel down!
{51331}{51446}- Isn't it too cold?|- No.
{51569}{51627}I'm like blindman.
{51628}{51703}There is a free guest room in our house.
{51704}{51781}You will relax there.
{51782}{51855}He knocked me down from the tower, toad.
{51856}{51954}The bell clapper saved me.
{51955}{52049}I heard the strange toll.
{52050}{52142}I prayed for you.
{52305}{52388}Plague is our best friend.
{52389}{52472}If my uncle don't get enough fresh blood.
{52473}{52537}- He will die of a terrible death.|- You are cruel
{52538}{52600}He is 100 years overdue for death.
{52601}{52681}The monster.
{52864}{52994}It's nothing, just a hanged man.
{53226}{53268}Where are we?
{53269}{53343}Still under your house.
{53344}{53386}I'm afraid.
{53387}{53451}Be brave!
{53452}{53506}Who is in these coffins?
{53507}{53695}Victims from which the polecat sucked blood.|Look here.
{53757}{53830}Grandmom!
{53844}{53914}Valerie!
{54583}{54716}Excuse me, I was't suitably dressed.
{54717}{54812}This is your room.
{54887}{54968}I thought that the room was free.
{54969}{55050}I came on the night coach.
{55051}{55106}Do you recognize me, don't you?
{55107}{55169}I'm your remote cousin.
{55170}{55231}Call me Elsa.
{55232}{55302}Valerie.
{55304}{55404}And this is...|...this is my brother.
{55405}{55470}Orlik.
{55477}{55612}I have settled in your room as you can see.
{55613}{55659}I give it up.
{55660}{55763}No, no, you will give me another one.
{55764}{55819}I will talk to grandmother about it.
{55820}{55923}Your grandmother had left, dear child.
{55924}{55979}Without farewell?
{55980}{56107}Old people have strange habits.
{56141}{56302}- I hope you will allow me to take her room.|- With pleasure.
{56303}{56400}This room is yours.
{56471}{56538}Please.
{56861}{57021}- I'd love to ride a horse.|- I'll lend you mine.
{57022}{57157}I am very tired, I will go to bed.
{57216}{57366}- Don't you recognize me, Valerie?|- No.
{57493}{57628}You are not afraid of me, are you?
{57639}{57829}I'm just joking, my dear.|We really meet for first time.
{60453}{60533}My earrings.
{61290}{61367}Your sister hasn't returned?
{61368}{61452}Where is Valerie? Do you know?
{61453}{61643}- You are sweet when you are angry.|- Where is Valerie!?
{61652}{61762}I will tell you on one condition...
{61763}{61875}...that you will love me.
{61935}{62000}Never!
{62070}{62117}Go away sir.
{62118}{62157}No.
{62158}{62249}I'm not your guest. You go!
{62250}{62352}You will regret that!
{63549}{63624}You will have glorious death.
{63625}{63723}Die as maiden! Die!
{63754}{63862}Orlik!? Orlik!? Orlik!?
{63983}{64183}Good night my dark haired girl, good night and sweet dreams.
{64221}{64374}When you wake up don't reveal the secret.
{64490}{64556}Valerie you are saved.
{64557}{64598}I heard everything.
{64599}{64659}My cousin loves you.
{64660}{64725}- Cousin?|- I know.
{64726}{64780}It's grandmom.
{64781}{64842}She stole my earrings.
{64843}{64910}But empty.
{64911}{65019}There is their mystery.
{65031}{65097}They will save you from danger of death.
{65098}{65166}Beware of polecat!
{65167}{65209}Where is he?
{65210}{65254}He's dying.
{65255}{65314}Wretch.
{65315}{65415}You were sold on his charm.
{65416}{65462}Valerie.
{65463}{65540}I love you.
{65544}{65574}You can't!
{65575}{65618}- We are brother and sister.|- But...
{65619}{65681}- We have the same father.|- ...that's not not true.
{65682}{65745}Valerie, come back.
{65746}{65871}Valerie, my father is polecat!
{66919}{67044}Yea and nay, yea and nay, yea!
{68085}{68153}I'm dying.
{68154}{68221}I'm dying.
{68222}{68293}Now you can see what old age means.
{68294}{68359}Valerie? Valerie?
{68360}{68437}You are wasting your time.
{68438}{68504}Valerie's dying.
{68505}{68630}I sacrificed her for my youth.
{68685}{68791}You are as lost as I'm.
{68792}{68861}You will fall into the same spasms.
{68862}{68973}Only your granddaughter could save us both.
{68974}{69066}She has my blood.
{69069}{69089}How is that?
{69090}{69169}Her father was not the bishop?
{69170}{69244}I was bishop!
{69245}{69304}I'm her father.
{69305}{69350}You lie.
{69351}{69398}Drink!
{69399}{69449}- Drink!|- No!
{69450}{69638}- First tell me how to extend my youth.|- Save Valerie!
{69642}{69761}Our salvation is in her blood.
{69762}{69810}Valerie.
{69811}{69899}Damned Valerie.
{70037}{70107}It's me.
{70122}{70172}Father!
{70173}{70246}My child!
{70311}{70386}Take this.
{70516}{70596}No i detest.
{70604}{70713}I'm a human again and I have to die.
{70714}{70809}No, you won't die.
{71550}{71610}You saved me.
{71611}{71671}Dad.
{71798}{71949}- Let me go! I please you.|- I'm again the monster.
{71950}{72025}Let me go!
{72029}{72095}Leave me alone!
{72096}{72174}No! No! No!
{73688}{73749}Gracian!
{73750}{73827}My Gracian!
{73954}{74024}Gracian!
{74064}{74181}Your lover sleeps like a log.
{74182}{74252}Gracian.
{74339}{74422}Poor Gracian.
{74438}{74552}I have a certain plan, Elsa.
{74553}{74655}I need Orlik's heart.
{74663}{74708}Do you want to kill Orlik?
{74709}{74797}His heart will reanimate my daughter|and give her eternal youth.
{74798}{74891}Richard, transplant Orlik's heart into my chest.
{74892}{74999}Are you going to betray Valerie?
{75000}{75110}Richard, you will do it.
{75198}{75298}With bleeding heart.
{75424}{75463}Orlik?
{75464}{75495}Orlik?
{75496}{75596}Why did i leave you.
{76061}{76093}Help!
{76094}{76123}Help!
{76124}{76202}Why do you show your face to me, Valerie?
{76203}{76317}Don't worry, I'm not dead and you are neither.
{76318}{76460}Come on, I will show you the way out.
{76533}{76609}Parsonage is on the opposite side, reverend.
{76610}{76687}Reprobate, you tempted me to commint a sin.
{76688}{76771}You will see!
{76944}{77016}"Valerie.
{77017}{77051}Valerie.
{77052}{77110}I'm saying good bye.
{77111}{77229}You have left me and the monster had disgraced your mouth.
{77230}{77313}We could have been so happy together but it's too late now.
{77314}{77360}Believe Valerie.
{77361}{77464}Polecat is not your and mine Father.
{77465}{77547}You extened his life.
{77548}{77658}I wanted be your guardian, friend and husband but it's too late.
{77659}{77752}Farewell Valerie, your Orlik.
{77753}{77789}Valerie?
{77790}{77833}Valerie, what happend to you?
{77834}{77864}Come.
{77865}{77935}Hedvika.
{78225}{78283}Hedvika?
{78284}{78405}Hedvika, what happend to you? Hedvika?
{78406}{78478}I'm fading from wedding.
{78479}{78528}- Eat strong soups.|- No.
{78529}{78606}No. No. No.
{78611}{78744}I'm under the spell of a vampire.
{79023}{79093}Valerie?
{79097}{79187}See my shoulder.
{79260}{79299}Does it hurt?
{79300}{79348}Oh no. No.
{79349}{79397}Do you see anything on my lips?
{79398}{79494}- No, why?|- Are not they stained?
{79495}{79613}You ate fruits, didn't you?
{79723}{79840}I'm not afraid of anything when you are with me.
{79841}{79894}I'm so happy.
{79895}{80023}I have never had a real friend.
{80630}{80682}Valerie?
{80683}{80756}Valerie, I'm saved!
{80757}{80806}- Hedvika.|- See!
{80807}{80902}The stain is gone.
{80988}{81162}- Your kisses gave me back my health.|- You are so beautiful.
{81163}{81246}There lives a witch among you!
{81247}{81324}She tortured me with sinful words.
{81325}{81424}She rubbed her slick hips against me.
{81425}{81515}Whe she found that I could resist her seducements.
{81516}{81614}She threw a noose round my neck.
{81615}{81770}I thank God that I'd escaped with my life.
{81771}{81894}But the witch is hidden among you.
{81895}{81950}In name of God give her in!
{81951}{82073}- She deserves to be burned to death.|- That's lie! Don't believe him.
{82074}{82127}It's her! The witch!
{82128}{82195}Don't believe him! He is lying, I swear.
{82196}{82265}Apage satanas!
{82266}{82396}Catch her! On the pyre with her!
{82838}{82949}Plead guilty! You are a witch!
{82950}{82997}Lier, firer.
{82998}{83068}Expiate.
{83158}{83258}Moustached comedian.
{84833}{84866}Orlik.
{84867}{84979}Why have you forsaken me?
{87258}{87356}Come here, bitches!
{87435}{87550}Have you ever been beaten?
{87843}{87908}Beast!
{88493}{88539}Drink deep!
{88540}{88610}Richard.
{89440}{89520}Disappeared!
{89587}{89664}Polecat!!!!
{91251}{91381}I wish all the spells went away.
{93296}{93369}Grandmom.
{93449}{93487}When did you come back?
{93488}{93633}Where from, my child, I was in church.
{93773}{93900}Have the missionaries gone yet?
{93950}{94028}Which missionaries?
{94029}{94144}What happend to you child?
{94207}{94302}Nothing, grandmom.
{94726}{94767}Grandmom?
{94768}{94878}There is an unknown boy.
{94893}{95058}It's only a actor,|who wander around the town.
{95595}{95654}"My dear.
{95655}{95733}Don't go to the theater.
{95734}{95792}Let
{95798}{95873}right away
{95888}{95939}harness the horses
{95940}{96050}and go to the blue lake.
{96208}{96325}Don't shoot for god's sake!
{96611}{96650}Miss!
{96651}{96774}Miss, your grandmom is dying!
{96814}{96861}Grandmom!
{96862}{96989}Dear grandmom, how do you feel?
{97042}{97114}Grandmom.
{97277}{97308}Grandmom.
{97309}{97376}Mirror.
{97751}{97885}Coach without a driver went out from court.
{97886}{97974}This is a good sign.
{97975}{98135}I never had a courage to tell you the truth.
{98238}{98386}Your mother loved certain young hunter.
{98447}{98521}And gave birth to his two children.
{98522}{98605}Boy and girl.
{98661}{98783}But, Richard, my lover told me that those children were his.
{98784}{98843}And I, from jealousy,
{98844}{98930}drove out your mother from the house.
{98931}{98994}I kept the girl.
{98995}{99044}That's you.
{99045}{99136}Orlik was kidnapped by Richard|and ended up in an unknown place.
{99137}{99208}I drove out your mother with these words.
{99209}{99263}"I will only take you in
{99264}{99334}when the horses bring you back."
{99335}{99448}My mother is still alive?
{99540}{99613}Grandmom!
{100305}{100349}Mom!
{100350}{100423}My child!
{100643}{100765}This is your father, my dear.
{100817}{100892}I know your face from somewhere, father.
{100893}{101040}You probably remember it from babyhood.
{101315}{101452}Is this all real, it's not a dream?
{101522}{101672}I wish your grandmother had forgiven me.
{109750}{109905}Subtitles made by mrickx|mrickx@centrum.cz
Come on, boys.
Hey, Captain, why the haste?
The city will not vanish.
It is not the city of Charak he wishes to see, but someone who dwells within.
After a long voyage it's good to stretch one's legs.
The only good thing about this port is the inn of Abu Jamil.
I have been dreaming of his roasted sheep's eyes.
- And I of the eyes of his daughter.
- You're dreaming of more than her eyes.
- Captain, my mouth is dry.
- Let's sample the wines of Charak.
- My thirst is of a thousand men.
- If you drink, you'll go no further.
- Remember the last time?
- You were stripped of your possessions!
Because of that I added four more eunuchs to the population.
Allah be with you.
All the paradise I seek is here.
Who wants anything more?
I shall stay behind.
All silent, no sound, no lights...
A city of ghosts.
- Why is the gate closed?
- Curfew is not until midnight.
No sentries about.
Ho there! Captain of the watch!
Open the gate!
- Wake, wake, wake, wake!
- It's Sinbad, friend of caliph Kassim!
And a better friend to the Princess Farah!
- Captain Sinbad.
- You know me?
I am a merchant. I hope to purchase some of the cargo you'll unload tomorrow.
No one is admitted to Charak after sunset.
- But why?
- The plague. Many have died.
Every time we reach this port some misfortune strikes us!
- The caliph Kassim and his sister?
- They're well. But he's not caliph yet.
I was told in Jerash that
Kassim's father died three months ago.
Kassim has not yet been crowned.
- We'd better return to the ship.
- Yes, let's sell our cargo elsewhere.
I'm not leaving Charak until I see Princess Farah and Kassim.
- Is there another way into the town?
- No.
But if you wish to take the risk you may enter at daybreak.
Until then I can offer to relieve your disappointment.
My tent has wine, food and music.
My people are your servants.
Please, be welcome.
Come.
Hassan, don't drink!
The wine is poisoned. Help Aboo-Seer.
Who are you?
Why have you tried to poison us?
From the depths of the earth,
I command you: Arise!
Destroy them!
Kill Sinbad!
Everyone back to the ship!
Captain Sinbad! ...Wait.
Princess Farah!
Quickly.
Praise to Allah that I found you.
I must talk to you.
Not here, not now.
And no going back that way.
Come with me.
Keep rowing back to the ship!
Keep rowing, keep rowing!
Make for the open sea!
- Hoist the mainsail... do it!
- But the shoals, Captain.
We will risk them, there is a full moon.
We'll lie offshore and not return until daybreak.
- You will go back?
- At dawn.
Warm yourself.
Here, take this.
Drink this.
You were searching for me. Why?
I was told of your return.
I need help desperately.
- My brother is in great danger.
- Prince Kassim? I owe him my life.
A spell has been cast upon him.
My uncle Balsora will tell you.
- Why not you?
- I beg of you, do not leave Charak!
- Trust me for my brother's sake.
- For him I would risk my life.
For you... I would give it.
- I was told there was plague.
- Not true.
Balsora rules the city by day... but by night fear rules Charak.
- People whisper of witchcraft.
- How can I help?
- You will find a way.
- Come... lie down.
- I prayed every day for your return.
- It's been almost a year.
- I was not willing to give up the sea.
- Nor I my life at court.
- Now I've decided to live on land.
- And I to live at sea.
I have returned to Charak to ask Kassim for your hand. Will you consent?
Willingly.
But only when my brother is able to stand before you and give his consent.
- When he is himself again.
- Himself?
After my father's death,
Allah protect his soul...
The astrologers had decided that the first full moon would be auspicious -
- for the coronation of my brother.
On the day of the ceremony, the procession began, -
- but even as the crown was being placed upon his head...
Lie back.
It was the last time I saw him as the Kassim I've known all my life.
Young, handsome... a true prince.
You talked of a spell...
- Or has he fallen victim to the plague?
- Worse than a thousand plagues!
Do not talk of it now.
Hassan, where is the Captain?
- What is it?
- His Excellency is here!
The Vizier Balsora.
Ask the princess to come on deck.
- Excellency.
- Captain... welcome again to Charak.
There she is... may Allah's name be exalted.
I prayed that Princess Farah might reach you safely last night.
- Has she told you?
- Yes, this morning.
But is it true, Excellency?
Let's go on board.
My beloved child.
Praise be to Allah you are safe.
Hassan, food and drink for our guests.
The rest of you, back to work.
- You have told him of our misfortune.
- But is it true, Excellency?
Tragically, horribly.
We have consulted all the wisest men and skilled doctors.
- They can do nothing.
- Come. Sit down.
You have travelled to many lands, help us.
- Perhaps there is someone somewhere.
- I will do all in my power to help.
But this requires skills far greater than mine.
It needs an understanding of the black arts, a great alchemist, a magician.
Wait... Yes, I have heard of such a man, if he still lives.
- Who?
- A Greek.
Some say the wisest man in the world.
His name is...
- Hassan, you remember.
- Melanthius! The hermit of...
- Maroof?
- Casgar.
A remote haunted island.
- Have you been there?
- No.
His deeds are legendary, but he may not even exist.
The island is ringed with deadly reefs.
- You must take us to him.
- It would be dangerous.
I cannot allow you to go.
Unless Prince Kassim is crowned before the passing of seven moons, -
- he will lose forever his right to be caliph.
- Melanthius is our only hope.
- Some say he's mad.
The island savages eat human flesh and worship him.
I will send treasure.
Gold and precious jewels for you, your crew and Melanthius, -
- if only he can restore my nephew.
Should I undertake this voyage, it would not be for gold or jewels, -
- but for a treasure far more precious.
Oh, my beloved son.
May Allah preserve you.
Keep those horses steady!
- Who is that?
- Zenobia, my stepmother. She hates me!
- She was not at court.
- My mother died when I was born.
It is said Zenobia is a witch and willed her death.
Allah protect us! Why is she here?
Be on your guard, Sinbad, she's more dangerous than a scorpion!
Queen, may Allah's blessings be on thee.
We meet at last, Captain.
What brings you back?
To deliver my cargo... and to visit my friend Kassim.
- And his sister?
- I am bound by love to them both.
I intend to ask the caliph Kassim for the hand of Princess Farah.
There's no caliph to consent to your marriage.
Kassim has not yet been crowned.
Nor is he likely to be.
I have been told of the events at the coronation.
I shall help if I can.
Kassim is beyond help.
Do not be blinded by love.
Balsora must be made to understand no one can help him.
- I shall tell him.
- Do not provoke her!
Why do you interfere?
You can do nothing for Kassim.
- Captain Sinbad can help us.
- I implore you, be silent.
What can you do -
- when they've consulted all the wise men, doctors, priests, astrologers?
- There may be another.
- No one! Abandon this false hope.
- Kassim is doomed forever.
- You lie. You want him doomed.
Within the passing of seven moons, if Kassim is not crowned caliph, -
- he will lose his right forever.
You bewitched him.
You want your son Rafi to be caliph!
Let me cut the smile from her face!
Let me go!
You'll bring an eternal curse on us -
- if you draw one drop of blood from any member of the royal family.
It's only for that she hasn't murdered Kassim!
As cunning as a snake, as malicious as a shark. Rafi will never be caliph!
- There is no one to prevent it.
- Melanthius will prevent it.
Melanthius is a myth and his powers are a legend. He does not exist.
We shall soon discover if the myth and the legend exist. We sail tonight.
My beloved, may your days always be blessed.
Sail for Rhodes or Tripoli, you'll find richer cargo there.
Set sail in search for Melanthius and you'll set a course for damnation!
Aboo-seer, Hassan, Bahadin.
Prepare the ship for sea.
Order your men to bring treasure for Melanthius.
We sail for Casgar.
One thing I advise...
Set a careful watch on Zenobia.
I will have my men watch her castle by day and by night.
Zabid will be in command.
He's the best soldier I have.
My son, Sinbad has agreed to help them. We must act quickly.
He has taken them to the Isle of Casgar to consult the great sage Melanthius.
- Is the heart ready?
- Yes.
You said no one can help Kassim.
Exquisite, my son.
If Melanthius truly lives, he is the one person who could.
You promised me. I am to be caliph. You swore Kassim would never inherit Charak!
- I shall prevent it.
- How?
Sinbad has a ship, a crew.
Balsora has the palace guards.
We shall have other forces at our command.
More powerful than a palace guard and a lovesick sea Captain and his crew.
That... will be our army.
Quickly as you can.
We must be away before nightfall.
- Take that box in my cabin.
- Carefully, I implore you!
It's a baboon!
What a beautiful specimen.
Get back to work or I'll make baboons of you!
Does he do any tricks, Princess?
There, there...
They mean no harm.
O brave and proud bull -
- whose mighty heart my son has fashioned of purest gold.
Beat... with the power as only I command you.
I made it perfect in every detail.
O mighty Abu Salem... you who rule over a thousand devils, -
- by all the fires of hell and darkness, -
- give strength and life to this your creature.
Minaton... Minaton...
Perfect!
A colossus of bronze... and mine to command.
- Hear anything?
- Nothing.
Keep awake! Orders are to keep a watch on Zenobia's castle.
Or I'll slit your throat.
The wind is dying.
A baboon that can play chess?
Go away!
- He's frightened of you.
- I'm frightened of him.
He attacked me.
Baboons can turn savage, you know.
He is not savage!
I command you to go away.
Is he a gift for the wise man of Casgar to play chess with?
Go away!
Hassan, get back to your work.
- But Captain, the beast was playing...
- ...chess, he has beaten me twice.
He is not really a baboon.
He was transformed by the black arts of Queen Zenobia's witchcraft.
He is... Prince Kassim.
Can you be certain that it is not the princess -
- who has been bewitched to believe this animal is a prince?
He is my brother.
Look!
I am Kassim.
Now do you believe?
What is it?
What could it be?
A ship that moves without sails!
He seems to be rowing for six men.
Come on, let's try to get aboard.
Hurry, it's moving out to sea.
A fishing boat.
Spies of Balsora!
Minaton...
Wheel head into them.
It's Zenobia!
For the love of Allah, row!
Row, will you!
Row, you thickheads, row!
It's witchcraft!
- Save yourselves!
- Ram them, I said. Ram them!
Mercy! Save me!
Minaton... Minaton.
Wait... wait!
And now for Casgar.
North by north-east.
I see nothing.
Breaker ahead!
The rocks and the reefs will be invisible.
It'll be impossible to land.
- I have an excellent idea.
- Yes?
Let's turn back.
- Lower the rowing boat.
- Aye aye, Captain.
Hassan, keep up!
Stay close together, move!
Rest.
How can you be sure where to find Melanthius?
This is a path.
There are tracks. Signs.
Forward, men!
There!
A great pillar.
- Must be a holy place.
- Built by a people of great skill.
- What can it be?
- A temple perhaps.
It seems to be carved out of solid rock.
Could be there is treasure in it.
Could be the castle of Melanthius!
Melanthius! Melanthius!
I will see if anyone is there.
- They'll kill us!
- Run for the wall!
They will not harm you now.
Have you been shipwrecked?
No, my ship is anchored safely.
I am Captain Sinbad.
Only those who were wrecked have landed here before.
But the Casgar people always found them first.
We seek the wise man known as Melanthius.
Does he truly exist?
- Does he live on this island?
- Why do you seek him?
It is a matter of great urgency and importance.
Go!
Go, I said!
This is Princess Farah from the distant city of Charak.
I am Dione.
- Come.
- But Melanthius... does he exist?
Follow me.
Truly incredible!
A magnificent city.
But completely deserted.
Who built it all?
- The ancestors of the natives.
- What happened to them?
They became too civilised and destroyed each other.
Is that where the savages live?
Those are the tombs of their forefathers.
- And those buildings to the right?
- Tombs of kings.
There is someone there.
Is that the great Melanthius?
Yes, father... I will.
Melanthius will see you.
- How did you?
- My father taught me.
He calls it "telepathia". A Greek word for communication of the mind.
Come, follow me.
- Master Melanthius.
- You're a brave man, Captain Sinbad.
And a remarkable navigator to have landed on Casgar safely.
Only for that have I agreed to see you.
Well, thank you... but I still don't understand how you know who I am.
The mind is an extraordinary thing.
Thought is transferable.
It can travel through space, even to the stars.
But the method needs time, patience and a skilful daughter.
What have you got in there?
Tell me.
- It's a cage holding...
- Wait! Don't tell me.
It's an arboreal anthropoid of the genus papio.
- No, it's a baboon!
- That's what I said, a baboon.
- What a dear little fellow.
- Careful!
He can be savage with everyone but the princess.
As a species they are aggressive and of low intelligence.
- He trusts only me.
- He looks so unhappy, poor creature.
Careful!
- It is the baboon about whom...
...you wish to see me. Yes, I know.
I suggest we continue below in my laboratory, out of the sun.
You claim it can write and play chess?
It, my brother, was a brilliant chess player from the age of seven.
Dione, fetch me a mirror.
As a scientist and alchemist
I know that metals can be transformed, -
- but as a philosopher...
Easy, fellow, easy.
I can also believe in the possibility of
...metaphysical change.
Thank you, Dione.
Let him see his face.
Go on!
He's weeping.
By all the gods!
A true baboon would have attacked its reflection, thinking it an enemy.
It would not have recognised itself and been moved to grief.
I am very happy to meet you,
Prince Kassim.
The oars...
Rafi, what has happened?
The oars are smashed.
It will take hours to repair. Quickly!
Sinbad found a way through.
Whatever drug or elixir it was that this woman...
Zenobia.
Whatever it was she used is the most powerful black magic -
- and is beyond my knowledge.
You see, unfortunately, time is on her side.
Perhaps the prince would like some of these.
Real apes are mostly vegetarian.
- How does he like his fruit?
- He does. He likes them.
I thought he would.
- Dione, where is the mint tea?
- Coming, father.
I brought him something.
Bananas... he likes those.
I'll serve the tea.
What did you mean when you said that time was on the side of Queen Zenobia?
The longer that transformation is delayed, the more likely -
- Kassim is to lose those human qualities that remain to him.
Then there is no hope for my brother?
Now, wait...
There was a time when men knew how to combat this form of black witchcraft.
A nation with an intelligence far superior to anything we know today.
They knew the secret of transforming matter.
Dione, help me find the Arimaspi scrolls.
The Arimaspi?
Yes, Archimedes of Syracuse, a very dear friend of mine.
He based many of his inventions on principles originally developed -
- by Arimaspi mathematicians.
Here they are!
Invaluable manuscripts... Where are they?
I've found them.
Yes, these are the ones.
Clear the table.
These scrolls are more than two thousand years old.
- There we are.
- What do they say?
This first one... will be of special interest to you, Captain.
It's sailing directions.
The first written authority.
The only way to restore Kassim is to undertake a journey to their country?
A journey to Hyperborea, the land of the Arimaspi, -
- is the only possible way of restoring Prince Kassim.
These scrolls confirm the legend.
It tells of a warm and green valley at the northernmost point of the world -
- surrounded by wide seas of ice.
There in the valley of Hyperborea, the Arimaspi built a shrine.
The shrine of the four elements:
Earth, fire, air and water.
Within that shrine is the source of all their extraordinary power.
This power enabled them to preserve their valley against the glacier -
- and to change or transform the nature of matter.
I have been experimenting with a similar power.
- Is there truly such a valley?
- Beyond a doubt.
Then how soon can you be ready to sail?
The journey would be impossible!
It's the coldest region in the world!
Cold, certainly. Difficult and dangerous, perhaps, but not impossible.
We have you to interpret the scrolls.
I'm too old!
Besides there's so little time.
Come with us, Melanthius.
It can't be this noble prince shall spend the rest of his days in a cage.
The shrine is his one chance. You're the only one that can lead us there!
Please, say you will.
- Where did you find that?
- With the scrolls.
The key! The only means of opening the door to the shrine.
Hyperborea... to visit the shrine, examine the very source of life.
Archimedes would split himself with envy.
Now, everyone, stand well back!
Imagine that power a million times greater used not for evil, but for good.
That is what the Arimaspi have left us!
Yes, I will go with you.
- Thank you!
- Yes, by all the gods, I will.
No way of reading the sun.
Cloud and fog.
Hurry, hurry!
Listen!
They are leaving!
Hurry! We must follow them.
With a following wind to drive us, we should be many leagues into the...
And into the Western Ocean before the next full moon.
- Why not sooner?
- Not possible.
Time is our enemy on all counts!
At the moment Kassim is still in possession of certain human qualities.
The longer the transformation is delayed, -
- the more he'll revert to a baboon's natural behaviour.
More aggressive, savage, dangerous.
He may never be Kassim again.
We are under full sail.
I can do no more.
It is believed that there is a swift ocean current due north -
- across the Casgars.
North! They're moving north towards the Celtic Isles, but why?
We should be close to Sinbad's ship.
Keep a lookout.
I must know what advice the Greek gave them.
I must know what they mean to do.
I can't!
It was powerful enough to transform Kassim.
I must know.
Now... by Hecate -
- and all the secrets of darkness and forces of hell.
Come!
Captain Sinbad!
Is there no way of increasing our speed?
A ship can only sail as fast as the wind allows.
I'll have to consult the chart again...
Now the moon is on the wane.
No, no, no...
If you study my design, -
- you'll see there's more curve in the runners. The snow will be deep.
But I have never seen snow, Master.
Here, let me try it.
I shall join you in a few minutes.
Maroof, the chart!
Here, sharpen this.
Bahadin, more ropeties for the sledges.
The cargo nets will need to be prepared.
Everything as strong, but as light as possible.
Hassan, I told you to get that knife sharpened!
No, you must try.
You can do better, you know you can.
No, Kassim, not like that.
The other way around.
Like that.
Very well, as you're so bad-tempered, no more writing today.
Baboon!
Kassim, be quiet.
Your friend is very disobedient today.
- Please, Kassim, I'm trying to work!
- Will you be still!
Father, why is he behaving like that?
Be careful.
In the cage, in it!
Well, well, well. And what by Zeus and all the gods have we got here?
- And who?
- Zenobia.
I thought as much.
- But how?
- Never mind how.
Be careful.
Remember she's a witch, and dangerous.
Put me down! Let me go!
Don't hold me!
Don't hold me!
How dare you!
Captain... the glass jar there on the shelf.
It's like trying to hold on to a scorpion. Dione, clear the table.
Captain, put the jar down over there.
Make a space.
- No wonder Kassim was so violent.
- You should have left her to him.
No, Princess, no.
I want to interrogate her.
I suggest that whatever power she has used -
- to transport herself here and change her size -
- is similar in power and property to that which transformed Kassim.
But what is it and where is it?
Leave her in my charge.
I will try to extract it from her.
You must take every care.
A confrontation with evil could be dangerous.
Captain, take the princess and Dione up on deck.
Come with me.
Now then, mistress...
What powers have you used to shrink yourself?
- I will never tell you.
- Oh dear.
I despise brutality, -
- but at this present moment
I'm prepared to reject compassion.
The sting of this insect can be fatal to the strongest, -
- but to someone of your size...
Then answer my questions and quickly!
What are you searching for here on this ship?
These perhaps?
Or this?
How could you know of their existence?
When will you decide to return to your proper shape and size? And how?
Something of unique power.
The power that might be used to return
Prince Kassim to his human form -
- and make our journey to the Arimaspi unnecessary.
The Arimaspi!
Where is it? And in what form?
A liquid? A powder?
My locket! ...Gone!
You've dropped it, haven't you?
Now, where would it be?
Kassim... have you seen it?
Here it is.
It's mine, it's mine.
It belongs to me!
It's smashed, the liquid's evaporating.
There's not much left.
- Take care, the liquid is precious.
- Evidently.
I believe it is the very stuff you used to transform Kassim into an animal.
Perhaps there's not enough left to retransform him. I must test it.
- Yes, on our friend here.
- No, that's mine! I need it!
Will he be tempted?
There's a good fellow.
Lap it up, that's the way.
No, no, there's not enough!
Be silent!
By all the gods!
Kill! Kill the Greek!
Get away from me!
Transformed... the locket!
Get back!
- It's a mad bee!
- What is it?
It's not a bee. It's a mosquito!
What a mosquito!
The bird is getting away!
Kill the bird first.
We need the locket.
Praise be to Allah that you're unhurt.
Alas,
I underestimated the power of Zenobia.
I fear I've thrown away a chance for Kassim. I am profoundly sorry.
You were right, Princess.
We should have left her to Kassim.
Try to calm him, Dione.
He's becoming more savage. Best to keep him locked in his cage from now on.
Safe... You are safe.
Is there enough?
Yes, by all the gods of the underworld, there must be!
Not enough! Not enough!
If only I had seen more.
Memorised more, recorded it into my brain.
- A valley.
- At the end of the world.
And here: The shrine of the legends.
The healing shrine.
We must let Sinbad show us the way.
And then I shall find the means to prevent Melanthius from interfering.
Come, help me.
Ahoy!
Ice! Ice ahead!
- Where away?
- Dead ahead. Icebergs!
At last!
- Will it be soon now?
- We must sail north for four more days.
The less distance to cover on foot the better. Anything to gain time.
The fourth full moon.
Two degrees port!
Look at them.
One column of that on top of us and we'd sink like a ship of lead.
The entrance to the tunnel is somewhere there.
If we could enter safely, our journey will be all but over.
Sinbad, there!
Exactly as described in the scrolls.
Hassan, fetch me the chart.
- The tunnel leads directly to the shrine.
- It'll crack the boat like a walnut!
We must take the longer route.
There's less than three moons left.
If only we could've entered the tunnel.
We'll never make headway against this.
It's getting thicker every hour.
The hull must split if we go further.
Maroof... load up the sledge.
Throw up the ropes...
Quickly!
Keep moving, don't stop!
Pull! Keep pulling.
- It's easier to abandon it!
- Keep moving.
The ice is no match for a boat of bronze.
- And Sinbad?
- Perhaps smashed, drowned or frozen.
Bahadin!...
What could it be?
What is it?
Look, it's beginning to crack!
I'll get the others!
On your feet! Seize anything you can!
Spears, axes, anything!
Melanthius, protect Dione and the princess!
A giant walrus! We must stop it before it reaches the camp!
Hit the eye! The eye!
Attack!
Get the cargo net.
Careful, Maroof!
Protect the supplies!
Get the cargo net!
Unravel it. This way. Quickly!
Open it. Spread it out.
Push, go on, push!
He's pulling us!
Pull away from him.
He's pulling us!
Help me.
Cut me loose.
Sinbad, my foot!
Cut me loose.
Hassan, your knife!
Cut me loose, cut me loose!
Too bad you couldn't hold him.
I should've liked to examine him.
- Walrus giganticus, prehistoric!
- I'm sorry. Next time I'll try harder.
Are you hurt?
It is said a man has only one life.
Now I have two.
I owe them both to Captain Sinbad.
I've never seen a black man turn white before.
No sign of a tunnel between the cliffs.
The chart in the scroll is precise.
There is an entrance -
- and I mean to find it.
Minaton, sail on!
We've found it! We've found it!
Look, it's the aurora, see?
Hyperborea just beyond the hills.
And that strange glittering light?
The Arimaspi call it the gift of the winter Apollo.
We call it aurora borealis.
And there, directly below the aurora, -
- the Valley of the Shrine.
He's turning carnivorous.
I hope it is not too late for Kassim.
He no longer responds to human speech or contact.
Except for Dione.
Take them, Maroof.
Protect the women.
Sinbad, stand still!
All of you, don't make any sudden moves.
He's as frightened of us as we are of him.
- I'm more frightened.
- I'm twice more frightened.
Sinbad... lower your sword and step back slowly.
Do it!
What sort of evil monster is it?
It's not a monster.
It's one of man's ancestors.
They're not evil.
They're called troglodytes.
I've got the skull of one of them in my laboratory.
He's coming closer!
Dione... speak to him.
Gently...
They have no idea of language, -
- but these primates were known for their gentleness with females.
There, there...
No harm.
We mean no harm.
Friends.
We are friends.
Dione, be careful!
Kassim, he means no harm.
Perhaps he might be able to help us.
Dione, Princess...
Persuade Kassim to bring the trog over here. I've something to show him.
Bring trog.
Bring him over there.
There... to my father.
Kassim, I want the troglodyte to look at this.
The face drawn on the scrolls!
It marks the entrance to the valley, the gate to the shrine.
Where, where?
Hyperborea!
By all the gods, he's done it!
Hassan, Maroof, the weapons.
There! There it is!
The entrance to the tunnel of ice!
The way to Hyperborea.
We shall be there first!
The tunnel, Minaton.
I will light the torches.
- Farah, are you all right?
- Yes.
There! Look over there!
- The last of the Arimaspi?
- Who can say?
Minaton.
Listen!
The boat is still moving!
There's some extraordinary force pulling us like a mighty magnet, -
- drawing us to the shrine.
The face from the scrolls...
The gate to the shrine.
Come on.
Trog seems frightened of the gate.
- Frightened of what lies beyond, maybe.
- Why should he be afraid?
Like all primitives, he's afraid of the unknown.
Afraid of what he can't understand.
Help me move the bar.
It's no use. We cannot move it without blocks and ropes.
Trog will help us.
He must help.
The shrine of the four elements.
- See, it exists! A reality.
- Hope for Kassim... at last.
The arch!
The boat is stopping.
Wait.
Go on, up into the sunlight.
There it is.
Come!
At last you'll have a use for that precious key of yours, -
- if you can find a lock to fit it.
We'll find it.
The scrolls haven't been wrong yet.
We must look for an opening somewhere there among the rocks.
We must be close.
Hurry, Rafi!
Nothing... nothing.
I could not find an entrance.
We must make an entrance.
Rafi, Minaton, stay clear!
Spirits of the underworld, infuse this potion with your powers!
What was that?
- It's like an earthquake.
- There can only be one possible answer.
The witch.
Zenobia.
- He'll never break through.
- He must! He must!
He must!
Minaton, pull!
He's done it!
He's done his work.
The wall is breached!
- Look there!
- Zenobia's creation.
A bull's head, but a...
...giant's body!
Almighty God, defend us.
They shouldn't have forced an opening.
The power of the shrine is threatened!
The atmosphere inside is destroyed!
This key is useless!
Perhaps there's still time, but we must be swift!
Drawn down from the crown of Apollo itself.
The guardian of the shrine...
The ice is melting.
Look out!
- We must act at once!
- The cage... and the chains!
Just as described in the scrolls.
We must put Kassim in the cage and pass him through the column of light.
Sinbad, the chains!
See if they still operate.
- Thank all the gods.
- The gods have abandoned you!
Too late, Sinbad!
Kassim will never be caliph!
Now, Rafi, now!
Not the animal, kill Melanthius!
They are helpless without him.
Sinbad, bring Kassim.
May the gods of the Arimaspi grant us the time!
Bring him up, bring him up!
O great Apollo! All you gods and forces that work for good against evil, -
- help us now! O great mystery, come to our mortal aid!
Reveal your secret!
Lower the cage!
Your Highness.
Prince Kassim...
This way, Your Highness.
Master Melanthius, he made it all possible.
- How shall I ever thank you?
- It's an old debt repaid.
The power of the shrine is failing! We must go! There's not a moment to lose.
The temperature's changing violently.
Be swift or this'll become our tomb!
Zenobia!
She's gone!
Stand back! Get back!
- Come on, let's go!
- No, not yet.
Now, move! Move!
Take Dione and the princess back to the gate.
- We shall not leave you!
- Do as I say!
If I do not join you within an hour, then head for Charak -
- before the seventh moon is full.
Maroof is dead.
They're coming!
Where's Maroof?
Come on, we must not waste a moment.

C-C-Coming through.
Uh, pardon me.
Have a care there.
I'm, uh-- I'm sorry.
Uh-- Excuse me, sir.
- Oops.
- Egad!
Delegates, this is no time for levity.
Serious business, you know.
Serious business.
Now what?
Sir, there, uh-- there-- there are
1 3 steps on this ladder.
Oh, superstitious nonsense.
What next?
Oh, um, sorry, sir.
I'll, uh-- I'll have it-- have it out in-in a jiffy, sir.
''To Morningside Orphanage, New York.''
It's difficult to decipher.
I can't make it out.
''I am... in terrible... terrible trouble.''
Oh, oh, dear, it's all watered out.
''Hurry.
Help. Penny.''
Penny?
Morningside Orphanage?
Dash it all.
It's not much to go on, is it?
Oh. Oh, that poor little girl.
Oh, Mr. Chairman, please... please, may I have this assignment?
You, Miss Bianca?
Dear lady, it's absolutely without precedent.
I mean, it's not like the old days when it was a man's world.
However, I suppose there has to be a first time.
Uh, uh, Mr. Chairman, sir.
I-I-I don't think Miss Bianca should go. It could be dangerous.
I mean, I mean, any-- anything could-- could happen to her.
You see, dear lady, before our janitor interrupted...
I was about to suggest that you should have a co-agent go with you.
Gentlemen, who will volunteer?
Gentlemen, this is indeed a-- a most difficult decision to make.
I choose...
Mr. Bernard to be my co-agent.
M-Me? Oh, th-that's-- that's really very, uh--
No, uh, see, I'm-- I'm--
I'm a-- I'm only a-a-a ja-janitor.
Oh, come on.
We'll be a great team together.
Oh, come on!
Bravo! Bravo!
Ajanitor, my lady?
Oh, good heavens. Bless my soul.
Morningside Orphanage.
Here. H-Here it is.
Three blocks down and... uh, uh, four blocks over.
Well, why don't we take the shortcut through the zoo?
Uh, gee, uh, Miss Bianca, uh--
I-I don't know. I mean, it's-- you know, it could be risky.
Oh, come on.
Remember our pledge?
Through storm and rain and dark of night--
Never fail to do what's right.
All right, duty calls.
Uh, Mr. Bernard, um, maybe we'd better go back.
It's so dark in there.
Dark?
Who's a--
Who's afraid of the dark?
Look, you, uh--y-you stay here.
I'll-- I'll check it out.
Wait for me!
How-- How about trying, uh, three blocks down and, uh, four blocks over?
What did you do to make him so mad?
Nothing. He's just a-- just a grumpy old lion.
Well, after all, waking him up in the middle of the night--
Wouldn't you be grumpy too?
I didn't wake him up in the middle of the night.
I was walking through the thing, and he just--
I'll, uh-- I'll take a look around, see what I can find.
Miss, uh-- Miss Bianca, over here.
I-I found something.
- These are Penny's belongings.
- Good work.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Oh, look.
The little girl's treasures.
Boy, the things kids collect.
Do you think she could be still here in the orphanage?
Well, s-she can't be. It says on the box, ''Hold until further notice.''
Well, maybe she's been adopted.
No, because she would've taken these things with her.
- Mice!
- Cat!
Now, lookee here, you two... if folks find out that mice moved in here...
I-I'll get kicked out, lose my job.
Oh, d-don't worry, Mr. Cat.
We won't be here long.
I'm a mite too old to be chasin' mice.
Uh, sir, could-- could you tell us what happened to a little girl named Penny?
I sure can. But you ain't gonna find her around here.
The poor little thing ran away.
When-- When was the last time you saw Penny?
Was there anything unusual?
Try to remember.
Let's see now. Uh--
The last time I saw her... she was sittin' over there on her bed, all alone.
She looked awful sad, and so I asked her--
What's wrong, Penny honey?
Nothing.
Oh, come on, now.
Come on. No secrets.
You tell old Rufus, huh?
Well, it was adoption day at the orphanage.
Well, what happened?
A man and a lady came and looked at me... but they choosed a little redheaded girl.
She was prettier than me.
Oh! Sh-She couldn't be!
Y-You listen to me, darlin'.
You're something extra special.
No, I'm not.
Why, someday a mama and a papa will come to the orphanage... looking for a pretty little girl just like you.
- Honest?
- I'll bet my whiskers on it.
But you've got to believe it.
Keep the faith, sweetheart.
- Do you see that bluebird?
- Yes, I do.
Well, faith is a bluebird... you see from afar.
It's for real, and as sure as the first evening star.
You can't touch it or buy it or wrap it up tight... but it's there just the same... making things turn out right.
Can't touch it or buy it or wrap it up tight... but it's there just the same, making things turn out right.
But whoever adopts me has to adopt Teddy too.
Oh, they'll love him.
He doesn't eat much, does he?
Oh, here!
I brought you something.
Land o' Goshen! Catnip snaps!
No! They're ginger snaps!
Well, an old codger like me could use a little ginger.
I taked two extra ones for lunch today.
We're not supposed to do that.
Well, you can trust me.
I won't tattletale on you.
I love you, Rufus.
Gee, we'd better hurry, or we'll be late for supper!
She seemed happy enough, but the next thing I heard...
Penny was gone.
Well, aren't-- aren't the police still looking for her?
No, no, no, no.
They-- They gave up weeks ago.
Oh, this is terrible.
That poor little girl.
I just can't believe that Penny would run away.
Uh, Mr. Rufus, please think.
Now, there must be something else.
Well, come to think of it, there was.
Oh, no, no, it's-- it's nothing.
Penny wouldn't get in with her.
Get in what? W-With who?
Oh, a weird lady tried to give Penny a ride... but she wouldn't have anything to do with trashy people like them.
Trashy people? Who?
She and her partner run a sleazy pawn shop down the street.
Miss Bianca, we must go down there and investigate.
Suit yourself, but you'd be wasting your time going down there.
She could be in real trouble.
We gotta find her and help her.
Yeah, but two little mice.
What-- What can you do?
Bernard, uh, a child's book!
It's Penny's!
Then, uh--
Then she's gotta be here.
W-What's so funny?
Y-Your tail!
Here, here, let me help you fix it.
Who could be ringing at this time of night?
Madame Medusa's
Pawn Shop Boutique.
- Hello, boss.
- Snoops!
Don't tell me, Snoops.
Let me guess. You found it!
You've found the diamond!
Give you time?
You bungler!
You have been down there for three months.
Bottles? What bottles?
You caught Penny sending messages in bottles?
You blundering fool!
Can't you control a little girl?
Shut up! I am taking the next flight down to Devil's Bayou!
This is terrible.
We've got to go with her.
Yeah, come on.
In the suitcase.
Bumbling boob.
He fouls up everything.
Leave him for a few weeks and--
Oh, why won't this stupid thing close?
Out of my way, you road hog!
All passengers, please report for flight 6 1 4.
Hurry-- Hurry, Miss Bianca! Medusa could be down at the Devil's Bayou by now.
Oh, I'm sorry, but-- but a lady does have to pack a few things, you know.
Will Mr.Jenkins report to the ticket counter, please?
All passengers, please report for flight 6 1 4, now departing.
Flight leaves 6:45.
Oh, no, we missed the flight.
- Miss Bianca, if you hadn't--
- You worry too much.
You know that flights are always late.
Albatross Flight 1 3 to Tower.
Albatross 1 3.
Now, what did I tell you?
We are lucky, Mr. Bernard.
Luck? Flight 1 3?
Maybe we'd better take the train.
Wake up.!
Dad-rad it.! Somebody answer down there.!
Get off the dime.!
Hello.! Hello.!
Is there anybody down there?
Uh, h-h-hello?
Where have you been, oh,you lazy knucklehead?
W-We-We just got here, sir.
Uh, uh, see, my co-agent insisted on packing her, uh--
Look, bud, am I clear to land?
Traffc up here is thicker than fleas on a hound dog's--
Wo-Wow.! Dad-blast,you dirty road hog-- road hog-- Crazy--
Look-- One at a time--
You stupid, lunkheaded--
- Uh, what did he say, Mr. Bernard?
- I wouldn't dare repeat it.
Well, then give him the permission to land.
Uh, Captain, you, uh-- you have our permission to land.
- Well, it's about time, bud.!
- Look! Look! There he is!
Doesn't he fly beautifully?
And you wanted to take the train, you 'fraidy cat.
'Fraidy cat?
It's just that, uh--
No, I-I like trains.
I mean, they serve, uh, Roquefort, uh--
Pull up! Pull up!
Are-- Are--
Are you hurt, sir?
Nope.
One of my better landings, bud.
Oh, great.
Come on. We're--
We're gonna take the train.
Play it safe.
Train? Safe?
Listen here, buster.
-I'm as fit as a fiddle.
-And you look simply wonderful, Captain.
Oh, shucks,just call me Orville, little lady.
All right, all right, uh, it's most important we get to Devil's Bayou.
Well, now, will you just keep your shirt on?
Flight 1 3 hits the wild blue yonder in five minutes.
Eight, nine, ten, eleven... twelve-- Oh, no.
There are 1 3 steps on this ramp.
Well, why don't you jump the last one?
This is your captain speaking.
Welcome aboard, folks.
Fasten your seat belts. No smoking.
Just sit back and leave the driving to me.
Miss Bianca, be sure it's fastened good and tight.
I can't.
It'll wrinkle my dress.
Say, bud, read the checklist to me.
Uh, oh, yeah.
Goggles down.
- Check.
- Wing flaps down.
- Check.
- Tail feathers.
- Double check.
''If at first you don't succeed... try, try again.''
And here we go!
I sure wish we'd have taken the train.
Oh, I just love takeoffs!
Captain, you fly beautifully.
It's just like being on a ''roller scoater.''
- He just went through a red light.
- Oh, I do that all the time, darling.
Now, come on.
Stop worrying.
Come along
Will there be sunshine shinin'
Will we find a silver linin'
Come along
Sing a song
When today becomes tomorrow
Will we findjoy or sorrow
Sing a song
Is it wrong
To put all our hopes together
And wish for somethin'better
Is it wrong
To be loved
To face the future with another
Who means more than any other
Is to be loved
We'll paint the grey clouds
With pretty rainbow hues
And we'll brush the gloom away
And save it for a rainy day
Rainy day
Oh, today
If troubles cast a shadow
And shadows make the sun afraid to stay
Why, it's okay
'Cause there'll be sunshine shinin'
And we'll find the silver linin'
Another day
Uh, listen to this.
It says here Devil's Bayou is uncharted and hazardous.
Each day's operations...
Hmm, interesting. must be...
Good night, dear. planned with... care and--
Tomorrow is another day
Good night, Bianca.
How I hope you'll always stay
Penny!
Penny?
Penny, answer me!
Penny?
Snoops!
Snoops, get down here!
W-W-What's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?
That little brat has escaped again.
Nero, Brutus, bring her back, boys.
Why won't it start?
Snoops! What's wrong?
W-W-What's wro-- I don't-- I don't know.
It was working good yesterday.
Oh, shut up!
Send up flares!
Light up the swamp so I can find her!
Well, folks, we'll be landing at Devil's Bayou in just a minute.
Your crew thanks you for flying Albatross Air--
What in the--
Sufferin' sassafras!
My rudder's on fire!
Bail out! Bail out!
Help!
Bernard!
Mayday! Mayday!
Sufferin' catfish!
What on earth?
Luke! Luke, wake up!
Luke, get down here!
It's Orville!
Oh, that Orville.
No, Luke, no. He's in trouble!
You get down here right now!
I'm a-comin'.
Wow-wee!
This new batch really packs a wallop!
Look out below!
Oh, what a shame.
Here, honey, let me help you.
Say, cousin, you look like you could use a swig of this.
It's good for what ails ya.
There.
Where are you folks from, anyway?
We're--
We're from New Y-- New York.
Now, stand back, folks. I ain't gonna hang around this creepy place long.
Clear the runway!
Great balls of fire!
Holy smoke!
Why don't you watch where you're goin'!
Bernard, it's that terrible Medusa.
I'd like to give her a few whacks with my rollin' pin.
We swamp folks would like to run her clean out of our bayou.
Hold it. Hold it!
Somebody's comin' this way.
Why did you have to go and spoil everything?
Nero, don't you dare get my teddy bear wet.
Oh, it's that poor little young 'un.
She's tryin' to run away again.
It's Penny.
Oh, how terrible.
Hurry! We've got to find out where they're taking her!
You'll need a boat. Evinrude's got the fastest boat around here.
Evinrude, wake up!
Start up your engine, boy!
Send Evinrude back as soon as you need help.
I'll round up the neighbors!
Faster!
Evinrude, faster!
You stop that, Brutus.
This fog is awful.
You can't see a thing.
Sl-Slow down, Evinrude.
They gotta be around here somewhere.
Oh, dear! We've lost them!
Jehoshaphat!
Hang on!
Hard to port, Evinrude!
Help me, Bernard!
Help! Bernard!
Bianca!
C-Come on, Evinrude.
Give it all you've got.
Keep trying, Evinrude.
Poor Evinrude.
Your carburettor is all pooped out.
Bring her right on in, boys.
Come on.
So, you tried to run away.
Well, it didn't work, did it? Huh?
Put me down, Brutus!
Cranky old dragon.
Nice work. Good boys.
W-W-Wait, boys. Steady, boy.
D-D-Down, boys. Heel. Heel!
There, there, Teddy.
I won't let them do that to you again. Don't cry.
Oh, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.
Poor Teddy.
All she ever thinks about is that simple bear.
Now, you behave, or I'll let Nero and Brutus have your old teddy bear.
You will not!
Besides, I'm not scared of'em... like you are, Mr. Snoops.
Oh, don't you sass me.
Ah, uh, boys, take this naughty little girl to her room.
I can go by myself, thank you.
Stick around, Evinrude.
We'll-- We'll signal if we need you.
Look out! Here she comes!
Where is she? Where is she?
Ah, eh, w-where is she?
Oh, I-I sent her up to her room.
Why did you let her escape?
What is your alibi this time, nitwit?
Nitwit?
Well, don't blame me, Medusa.
Those leather-headed lizards of yours, they're supposed to be patrolling the island.
They let her get away.
Ha! My precious pets.
We know who caught that ungrateful little brat, don't we, hmm?
It was your brilliant idea to use the little girl for this caper.
- If you'd left it to me--
- Snoops, you're not thinking.
I know, I know. She's the only one small enough to squeeze down the black hole.
Yes, but why can't she find my big diamond?
I don't know, but-- but just look at these beauties that she brought up from the cave.
Oh, they'll sell for a lot of cold cash.
Ow!
I wish you wouldn't do that.
She's insane. Utterly mad.
I want that diamond.
I've got to have the Devil's Eye!
You didn't leave the girl down in the cave long enough.
She won't take orders.
You are too soft.
But the water was rising and the tide was coming in... and all she did down there was fuss about her teddy bear getting wet.
Snoops, you don't have a way with children.
You must gain their confidence... make them like you.
Yeah? How do you do that?
You force them to like you, idiot!
At the next low tide...
I am going to put her down there myself... and keep her there... until she finds it.
And it is as simple as that.
Oh, it's as simple as that, is it?
Well, you're the boss, uh, boss.
Yes.
Now come along, petsy-poos.
We gotta get Penny out of here tonight.
-Uh-oh. Bianca, they smell your perfume.
-Oh, dear.
- Oh, no!
- Mis Bianca!
Let go, you-you-you, you big bullies, you!
Brutus! Nero!
Stop that infernal racket!
I mean now!
Snoops! Snoops, a mouse!
Oh, kill it, kill it!
Oh, Snoops, kill it!
Look! There's another one!
Oh, what is wrong with this thing?
Snoops! What's wrong?
I don't--
E-E-Evinrude, over here!
Are you--
Are you all right, dear?
Why, she-- she tried to kill us.
That-- That-- That terrible woman!
Oh, if I was only a ten-foot mouse,
I'd show her.
It's-- It's no use, Bianca.
Maybe Rufus the cat was right.
Wh-What can two little mice do?
R-E-S-C-U-E
Rescue Aid Society
But, Bernard, the Society's counting on us.
We can't quit now.
Oh, and that little girl.
We've just got to rescue her.
Rescue Aid Society
Heads held high
Penny dear!
Auntie Medusa wants to talk to you!
High tide or not... that little brat is going to find me that diamond... tomorrow... or else!
Come in. Come in.
Did you want to see me, ma'am?
Why, yes, my dear.
Don't be so shy.
Now, I am going to let bygones be bygones.
Do you know what would make
Auntie Medusa very happy?
Yes, you want me to find that diamond.
That's right, dear!
But I've tried hard as I could, honest.
Of course you have.
But we must try harder, mustn't we?
Then please will you take me back to the orphanage like you promised?
Penny, don't you like it here?
A big, beautiful boat all to yourself.
But if I don't get back to the orphanage...
I'll never get 'dopted.
Adopted?
What makes you think anyone would want... a homely little girl like you?
Be brave, little one
Make a wish
For each sad little tear
Hold your head up
Though no one is near
Someone's waiting for you
Don't cry, little one
There'll be a smile
Where a frown used to be
You'll be part of the love that you see
Someone's waiting for you
Always keep a little prayer
In your pocket
And you're sure to see the light
Soon there'll bejoy and happiness
And your little world
Will be bright
Have faith, little one
Till your hopes and your wishes come true
You must try to be brave
Little one
Someone's waiting
To love
You
Good night, Teddy.
Sleep tight.
Oh, we almost forgot to say our prayers.
Please bless Rufus and Teddy... and all the kids at the orphanage--
Jennifer, Bobby, Mary,Julie.
And please let someone find my bottle.
There's a message in it.
Because running away isn't working. Amen.
Don't worry, Teddy. We'll--
We'll be all right.
Penny. Penny.
Yes?
Penny-- Penny, dear, now don't cry.
We are here to help you.
We-- Hi!
Where'd you come from?
We found the bottle with-- with your message, and we've come to rescue you.
Did you hear that, Teddy?
Our bottle worked!
Didn't you bring somebody big with you... like the police?
Uh, no, there's-- there's just the-- the two of us.
But if the three of us work together, and we have a little faith--
That's what Rufus said.
Faith makes things turn out right.
Penny, I know it's late, but we have to escape tonight, right now.
But I just got caught by Brutus and Nero.
Look what they did to my pants.
Yeah, and they're-- they're still down there guarding the gangplank.
Oh, those vicious monsters.
They ought to be locked up in a cage.
I know, I know.
Come on. I'll show you.
See there? The elevator.
Oh, it's a perfect cage, Penny.
Great idea.
Now, uh, wha-wha-- what can we use for bait?
Oh, they'll eat anything.
- Yeah, I know.
- I've got it.
My perfume. Remember? They'll follow the scent right into the elevator.
And I'll slam the door.
And would that make Medusa mad.
Brutus! Nero!
Did you let that little brat escape again?
You're too soft.
Hey, Penny, that's not bad.
That's exactly like Medusa.
Track her down, boys.
Bring her back.
And we'll be so far ahead, they'll never catch us.
Wait a minute. She-- She might catch us in-- in her swamp-mobile.
We'll swipe it.
I've always wanted to drive it.
Wh-What if Medusa wakes up wh-wh-while we're starting it?
W-We're in trouble.
We-We've gotta stall 'em somehow.
How 'bout Mr. Snoop's fireworks?
We'll shoot 'em off in her bedroom.
That will keep her busy.
Oh, Bernard, it's so exciting.
Perfume, crocs, swamp-mobiles.
It's just got to work.
It's our only chance.
But-- But we're gonna need help.
Snoops! Snoops, get down here!
Uh, w-what's up, Medusa?
W-What's going on?
Oh, shut up!
High tide or not--
I bet those two are up to something.
Gee, I don't wanna go down that awful black hole again.
Don't worry about that, dear.
You must hurry and get dressed.
Come on.
We haven't got much time.
E-Evinrude? Uh, up here.
W-We need help.
G-Go get Ellie Mae.
An-And hurry!
Ya-hoo!
Are you ready to help rescue that little young 'un?
- Sure enough, Ellie Mae.
- Hallelujah!
Luke! On your feet, you lazy critter!
Shucks, Ellie Mae. I was just a-waitin' for someone to holler ''charge''!
Dagnab it. Let's cut out the jawin' and get a-goin'!
When old Gramps gets ''het'' up, his nose gets plumb out of joint.
Take it easy, Gramps.
We gotta stay here till Evinrude brings us word from them mice.
If'n that bug don't get here soon... they'll put that poor little girl down the black hole again.
All right, you little brat. Now, you are gonna go down in that hole... and you are gonna dig till you find me the diamond.
You understand that?
And no sassing me.
Uh-uh-uh. Snoops, that is no way to speak... to our little Miss Penny.
What? Oh.
Okay, boss, okay.
Now, my dear... you are going to find the big, shiny diamond... for your Auntie Medusa.
Aren't you?
Teddy doesn't like it down there.
He's afraid.
Aren't you, Teddy?
Ah. Poor Teddy.
I'll just keep him up here with me, where he'll be safe.
Give me back my teddy bear!
He's mine! He's mine!
You get down there and find the big diamond... or you will never see that Teddy again!
All right, all right.
I'll go.
Boss, you've really got a way with kids.
Don't worry, Teddy.
I won't be gone long.
I'll find her old diamond.
Oh, what a dreadful, frightening place.
Yeah, it used to be a pirates' cave.
How do you know that, Penny?
- Him.
- Ah! Oh, dear!
Come on, girls. Let's-- Let's look for that diamond so we can get out of here.
Oh, I looked there already.
Medusa doesn't want those little ones.
What-- What's--
What's-- What's-- What's that?
That's where the water comes in.
I'm afraid to go over there.
Well, if I was a pirate... that's just where I'd hide the Devil's Eye.
I'll, uh-- I'll--
I'll go over and check it out.
Uh, come-- c-come to think of it... if I was a pirate, I wouldn't--
I wouldn't hide anything back there.
Bernard, look!
I can see something.
Come on.
- Come on. Let's see what it is.
- No, no, Bianca.
You-- You stay here.
I'll see if I can find a safe way over.
- Bianca!
- Oh! Hang on!
- Help!
- I'm coming!
- What are you doing down there?
- I'm looking.
Well, look faster.
Wow!
P-Penny, hold-- hold your lantern up again.
- Holy mackerel. That-- That's it.
- The Devil's Eye.
Penny, we found it!
We found it!
Medusa, I found it!
Let me look.
Let me look, Medusa!
Back! Ah, good girl.
Good girl, good girl!
Let's get it up here.
Look, it won't go through.
I can't get it out.
- What's taking so long?
- It's stuck tight.
Stuck tight?
You get that diamond, or you'll never see daylight again!
No, no, back! Back, Penny!
Oh, Penny, you'll fall!
For-- Forget the-- the diamond.
Let's get out of here before we drown.
The water's coming in.
Please pull me up.
Not until you get the diamond.
Penny, the-- the pirate sword.
Use-- Use the sword.
Penny! Penny, help!
I've got it! I've got it!
Hurry! P-Pull me up!
Faster, Snoops. Faster.
Pulling as fast as I can.
At last!
The Devil's Eye!
It's worth millions!
Just look at it.
Filled with power... for its owner.
Let me-- Let me look at it.
I can't--
Hey, that wasn't a very good look.
But I know that there's enough there to cut it into two equal shares.
You idiot!
Cut up a perfect gem?
And it's mine. It's all mine.
All yours? Half of it is mine, you double-crossing crook!
- Put me down, Brutus!
- It's mine! It's all mine!
- Double-crosser!
- Cheap pickpocket.
- Chiseler!
- Cheap crook!
Land's sakes!
It's Evinrude!
Oh, well, sure is a mess.
Where in tarnation you been, boy?
- What's happening?
- Do they want us now?
- Well, where are they?
- They're on the boat?
- Speak up, boy.
- Buck up! We mustn't be quitting now, must we?
Stand back!
Give poor Evinrude some air!
He's plumb tuckered out.
Here, son, this'll make a new bug out of you.
Charge! Ya-hoo!
We're gonna have us a rip-snortin' fight.
Yee-hoo! Charge!
Where'd everybody go?
I don't need any help from anybody!
Charge! Ya-hoo!
Welsher! Swindler! Chiseler!
Shut up, Snoops, and don't move.
If either of you try to follow me... you'll get blasted!
You give me my teddy bear.
You promised.
Teddy goes with me, my dear.
I've become quite attached... to him.
My diamond!
My diamond!
Charge!
Now!
Now! Now!
Look out!
Oh, please start.
Advance the spark.
Not the horn, the spark lever.
Digger, hold this.
It's that doohickey on the steering wheel.
You-- You... and your infernal fireworks!
You-- You--
Oh, you dunderhead!
We're not getting any gas.
Fill her up, Luke.
Hurry. All of it!
Look out! The riverboat!
- We did it, Bianca!
- Hooray! Oh, Bernard!
Bernard, you're wonderful!
- We did it!
- We got her!
We sure showed that Medusa!
There goes... my diamond!
And because of a courageous little girl named Penny... the world's largest diamond, the Devil's Eye... is now in the Smithsonian Institute.
But what's even more important, folks... this little orphan's dream has come true.
Today she's being adopted.
-And here she is with her new mother and father.
- For she's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
From Morningside Orphanage
She's got a new mom and dad
Hooray for her mom and dad
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Bernard, I am so happy for Penny.
- For Penny's a jolly good fellow
- Yeah, so y-you might say that...
- that Penny, uh, brought us together.
- From Morningside Orphanage
You are a darling.
Penny,you were a brave little girl to do what you did all by yourself.
Oh, I didn't do it all by myself.
Two little mice from the Rescue Aid Society helped me.
Mice? Rescue Aid Society?
Yes, they rescued me.
Uh, could I say hello to them?
Hello, Bianca.!
Hi, Bernard.!
You can talk to these little mice?
All the time.
Mice can talk like anybody.
Didn't you know that?
Well, uh, I didn't, but I do now, Penny.
Evinrude, what are you doing here?
It's another call for help.
Here, uh, uh... you're gonna need some volunteers.
But-- B-But, B-Bianca, we just--
Oh, Bernard, adventure, thrills... intrigue, travel, exotic places.
Oh, come on, darling. Let's go.
I sure wish we'd have taken the train.
Tomorrow is another day
How I hope you'll always stay
Tomorrow is another day
ORCA
- Hey, Nolan! Can you see anything?
- Not even a great white flounder.
Shark's fin at ten o'clock!
And it's a whopper!
Keep it this side of the ship.
Sheer off at 200 yards.
Gus, pitch it something to eat.
- Keep off, there's a diver down!
- Paul, keep him to the portside.
- Look out!
- Paul, hard to port!
Any fella dumb enough to dive when there's a great ...
Nice going, baby. You just cost us a quarter of a million bucks. lt's true. We get 10,000 a foot for a shark. He was at least 25.
- 50 foot he was ...
- He's coming back!
Climb aboard.
- Paul, pour on the coal!
- l'll come back to get you.
Fin at two o'clock.
- Look! That eejit's in the water.
- Ken, get back in the boat!
Only one creature in the world can do that. A killer whale.
This is the most powerful animal on the globe. The killer whale.
A mammal with warm blood, found in every sea.
The Romans called it Orca Orcinus,
''the bringer of death''.
His tapered form and muscular fin make it the fastest moving whale.
The adult male measures around 30 feet and weighs six tons, -
- though some run to 45 feet.
Here's a killer whale in familiar guise: tamed, on exhibition. lf treated with kindness, there is no greater friend to man.
But if not ...
The orca has 48 teeth set in two impressive rows.
Killer whales are better parents than most human beings.
And like human beings, they have an instinct for vengeance.
But the most amazing thing is neither gentleness nor violence, -
- but their brains.
Slides please, Ken.
These brains are of a monkey, a human being, and a killer whale.
We know little about its intelligence except that it is powerful, -
- and in some respects may even be superior to man.
A four-month-old foetus, incredibly like that of a human. lt even has two hands, with five fingers on each.
Whales talk.
They communicate -
- by sounds and sonar echolocation.
These whale sounds contain wavelengths -
- that can travel across an ocean, but also around the world.
This was recorded under water and analyzed by computers. lt contains 15 million pieces of information. The Bible has 4 million.
What are they saying? Do they have to say anything to communicate?
Their sonar is like X-ray vision. lf we could see in each other -
- if someone was happy or sad, indifferent or aroused, -
- healthy or suffering from a tumor, -
- it would be meaningless to say,
''How are you?''
What we call language they might call unnecessary, or retarded.
I noticed that my Iectures gained a new and attentive member: NoIan.
He began asking me at odd hours about the orcas, -
- and occasionaIIy about me.
His ignorance surprised me.
The fact that an experienced fisherman knew so IittIe amazed me.
His curiosity made him seem vuInerabIe, and even attractive.
Or I had been in NewfoundIand for too Iong.
Nothing interests fishermen unIess they want to catch it, or kiII it.
You're not building a holding pen?
When you pumped me about killer whales, -
- it wasn't to improve your mind, if any.
The lucky lad will have a long and happy life in some aquarium.
- How much will you get for him?
- Enough.
- Nolan, there's a word for you.
- l've been called it many times.
You plan to sell a creature like you?
A warm-blooded, intelligent mammal!
- He communicates.
- Does he now?
Look at me.
You think l'm pulling your leg?
No, but you're one hell of a girl to sleep in a tent with a tape recorder.
Did l tell you that that animal has a right to be left alone?
No, but l suppose you're about to.
These animals are too big and too smart. They live in constant motion. lt's worse than a lion in a cage.
Not to be screwed around with.
That's a dangerous word to use around a fellow like me.
You'll never catch a killer whale. ls there any way l can make you give up?
There's one you might try.
But l guess it's out of the question. lf that's what it takes ... lf you think l can't catch one, why are you so upset?
You won't catch one, but you might butcher a few in the attempt.
- That's not my style.
- So you refuse to quit?
That's not my style either. Especially when a pretty girl tells me -
- that l'm dumber than a fish.
Lots of bad luck.
How many c cs in the harpoons?
A whale is twice the size of a shark, so we use twice as much.
- Nolan?
- What?
- Killer whales are monogamous.
- What?
They stick with one mate.
We could bust up a happy family.
You continue what you're doing and bring it up.
Killer whales ahead!
We're off to the races, boys!
Annie, bring up the doped heads.
Here, take over.
Oh boy, look at them!
Don't approach them like a bull in a china shop.
Let me take over.
Merciful God, what's that?
You missed the male.
You hit the female.
- He sounds almost human.
- lt's a her. You can tell by the fin.
Paul, astern!
Paul, full ahead!
She's coming back.
She's trying to kill herself.
Stop the engines. Novak!
Help me get this crazy fish on board.
- Sling's tight.
- Haul away, Paul.
When she's clear, we'll swing her inboard.
- She's losing a lot of blood.
- l know.
- Get her off my ship!
- The cable has jammed the boom. lt's okay. lt's gone.
You flushed it over.
- What did we hit?
- l don't know.
Charts.
Paul, check the radar.
- Nothing.
- Check the depth.
85 fathoms.
The chart says the same thing, and there isn't a reef for five miles.
Help me check the bearing.
- You know what we hit?
- What?
We didn't hit anything, it hit us.
Novak, check the engine room.
Paul! ls that whale still alive?
- She's breathing.
- Go back to the wheel.
- Novak! Help me get her overboard.
- To hell with her.
- One more hit and he'll sink us.
- That's why l want her overboard.
Climb the boom and cut the rope.
Okay, cut her.
Novak!
- Are you all right?
- l'm okay now.
Oh, my God.
Let's go. Come on.
You drive on, l'll walk.
Are you reading to the whale? lt's not your style to butcher a whale by accident.
- What can l do?
- Don't look at me as if I'm crazy. l must say l'm amazed she swam up here against the wind and the tide.
She didn't swim.
Her mate pushed her.
He what?
- Didn't you anchor here last night?
- l did. Out there.
- He followed you.
- What?
He followed you.
She speaks the truth.
She knows from university, l know it from my ancestors. l'm delighted to hear that.
Who are you?
Jakob Umilak. l'm a teacher up north.
- Nice to meet you.
- You're the man who did this?
Guilty ...
Well, l must be off now.
- Please, listen to him.
- Why?
Our fathers once tried to kill a whale and only wounded it.
The whale capsized the boat and chewed up both hunters.
These whales have great memory.
Even after many years -
- they remember the human being who harmed them.
He saw you, Nolan.
He saw you on the boat. lf l were you, l'd stay far from his territory.
- l mightjust do that.
- You give up? l mightjust do that, too.
Bless him, oh Lord.
Let light perpetual shine upon him.
Amen.
That was nice, Reverend.
Thanks.
Would you give this in his name to the Seamen's Fund?
- He didn't have any family.
- Thank you.
There's something l'd like to ask you.
Would you wait for me outside, Paul?
- You're lrish?
- Yes.
Can't lose the accent. l've been here 16 years.
Laborers are a dime a dozen at home. l came over here to work for my uncle in his boat.
He died and left me the boat.
And he left me Gus.
Dear old Gus.
He taught me everything l know.
Which is precious little. l can understand how badly you must feel.
Fishermen like to die at sea.
He had a fear of dying in a home, with tubes sticking out of him.
But to die like this ...
Don't take it too much to heart.
What's done is done.
Right.
Reverend?
What l was meaning to ask you ...
Can you commit a sin against an animal?
You can commit a sin against a blade of grass.
Sins are really against oneself.
You understand? l do.
Thank you, Reverend.
- Thanks for the tie.
- l'm glad the pants fit.
- Excuse me. Nolan, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- l'm Al Swain. l'm in charge here.
- Hello, Al.
- What do you mean by ''in charge''?
- The Fishermen's Union and all that.
- We brought your boat in.
- Was that you? Thank you.
- Can l do anything in return?
- Nothing special.
South Harbor is a friendly place.
Everybody knows everybody.
Are you trying to catch a big, live killer whale?
No ...
We were for a moment, but l've changed my mind.
Just as well, because people are superstitious.
What do you mean?
An orca drives our fish away. lt's our livelihood.
You understand? ls that for me?
Thanks.
''Whales and Dolphins in Science and ...''
''... Mythology.'' ln celebration of the world's least known intelligence. So it's about me.
Herman Melville believed that God would come back to Earth as a whale.
You can't really believe all this stuff. Forgive me laughing. l'm not laughing at you, but it's a bit heavy for me.
- But thanks for the book.
- You're very welcome.
When we're finished burying the whale, l'll buy you a drink.
Thanks.
- Nolan, you got a minute?
- What do you want?
You're in a big hurry to bury that whale.
- You think so?
- l got some good news for you.
The boatyard will fix you up first thing in the morning.
Would you like a drink? You didn't come here just to say that.
- We figured you'd want to know.
- That's nice of you.
But l'm not in any great hurry to sail from South Harbor at all.
You mean you're staying until you kill that whale?
Not at all! l'm staying -
- because l've got a broken hull and a crew member with a busted foot. lt's got nothing to do with the whale.
Did l say something wrong?
First two boats are sunk, now the fish are vanishing.
- All because of your whale.
- My whale?
Forget about the whale. l have. l'll bet you'll never see him again.
An hour ago a kid saw a fin with a nick in it.
Stationary. lt's just waiting.
- Don't go to the North Point.
- Why would l? l said, ''Why would l?''
- l'll see you tonight, right?
- Wrong.
We've called the Coast Guard, the Canadian Fisheries Board, -
- even the US Marine Mammal
Commission. They won't do anything.
They say they don't have time.
And you know for damn sure
Nolan's not gonna do anything.
Can l help you?
The men all meet.
They talk of you, and they are angry. l understand.
They say you're a coward for not going out and killing the whale.
- l have my reasons.
- l believe you.
You do? Why? l see in your face fear.
Not of anything alive, -
- it is of some spirit. l've come to warn you. lt is best you hunt this devil. lf there's any more harm done by your whale ...
Look ...
Thank you for the warning. l know what my ancestors would have done.
They had this shaman. A skin whale stuffed with birds' livers.
They piss on it and throw it into the sea. lf all is done right, the evil spirit flies out of his mouth and he's dead.
- Maybe you should try it for me.
- The world has changed.
Even our gods dance to a new song.
Thank you.
Where is that ...?
They communicate like humans.
That's exactly what she said.
Hey, Paul! lt says in the book that whales ... lt's a pretty good likeness.
- Especially the head.
- What are you doing down here? l had to see what you wanted my camping gear for.
Don't tell me that scarecrow is going to keep him off.
No, l hope to bring him in.
Like last night.
You are the dumbest, maddest man l've ever met.
That's what l get for my books.
Are you gonna hypnotise him?
No, not exactly. l came down here to shoot him.
One through each eye.
But then l put myself into his position ...
He won't show.
Why not?
Why do you think he sank the other boats and not yours? l must admit that puzzled me.
He left you your boat because he wants to fight you on the sea. l won't do that. l refuse.
- ln fact, l won't fight him at all.
- You'll shoot him from the jetty.
You're an animal. Science should be observing creatures like you.
Go somewhere else for your excitement.
Excitement! ls that all it means to you?
- l think more of that whale than you.
- With a gun? l brought this gun to shoot him, yes. l did.
But when l came to do it, l knew l couldn't.
So l got to thinking. lf what you say is right and whales can communicate, -
- then l thought l'd look him right in the eye. l'd tell him that the killing of his wife and child -
- was a terrible accident.
That l didn't mean it. l'd tell him l was sorry, and hoped he'd forgive me. l understand what that whale feels.
The same thing happened to me.
My wife was pregnant and drove to the hospital.
A drunken driver hit her.
He killed her and my baby.
That's good enough, now get that thing into the water.
The town's working hard to fix your boat.
She'II be ready to saiI on the tide at 6:15.
- Who is this?
- You're not gone at dawn ...
Your girI's busted Ieg won't seem Iike nothing.
- ls that you, Swain?
- Just take some good advice.
Well, that decides it.
Paul, come here!
- You're leaving.
- What about the boat? l'll take care of that.
- What's the matter?
- l'll explain later.
Got any money?
Take that, fill her up with petrol. l won't tell my mother l was run out of town by a fish.
You can't blame them. l'd feel exactly the same way.
Hello?
- I'm going after him.
- After whom? What time is it?
Him. The whale.
Are you awake?
- l am now.
- I just wanted to teII you.
- The viIIage and the whaIe want it.
- The whale?
- Yes, it's what the whaIe wants.
- l should explain something to you.
You don't know what it wants. l don't know, nor do the villagers. lf he's like a human, what he wants isn't necessarily what he should have.
Forget what l said. l thought you were an insensitive bore.
But you're a sensitive bore.
- l take that as a compliment.
- Take it any way you Iike. l'll take it as a compliment.
See you, l'm off at dawn.
- Nolan! Don't hang up.
- What's the matter?
What about Paul?
What about Annie's leg?
- That's just the point.
- You mean you're going alone? lf l don't, l'm afraid of what they might do to Paul and Annie.
- And it's me the animal wants.
- Nolan, you're crazy! lf you're right and a human being were crazed with grief, -
- would you do anything he wanted?
No, you'd try to protect him against himself.
And, Nolan, who do you think you owe more to?
The villagers or that animal?
- All right, then l won't go.
- You mean that?
- I do.
- You'll call me in the morning?
I wiII.
- Promise?
- Promise.
Good night, then.
- Nolan? Are you going out too?
- l'm just going to pack some gear.
Take me with you.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Come on. l'll tell you what ...
Come and sit over here.
Rest that leg.
You've got a long, bumpy ride.
Good girl.
Fill her up and check the hood, l'll get the air.
- We're all out.
- Of air?
- Gas, oil, anything.
- You just put gas in that car!
- There are no bus tickets either.
- What's the idea?
Tell Nolan that he must accept what he already knows in his heart.
There's no way out but to the sea.
- The whale's gone.
- He's not gone.
He hides in a sea cave.
The monster's message is clear.
We must send him Nolan or he will torment the village.
This town's loony!
Tell your captain l'm not his enemy. l would sail as one of the crew, l could help him.
With me or without me, he has no choice but to fight.
What's the matter? l can't get up.
My leg ...
You all right?
- l can't move!
- Paul! Get the lamp by the door. l can't hold on.
Catch this, Annie.
Pull, that's it!
You revengeful son-of-a-bitch!
You win.
You want revenge?
You'll have it! l'm coming to get you! l'll fight you!
You revengeful son-of-a-bitch!
You win! Do you hear me?
You win.
NoIan's effort to spare his crew had faiIed.
The town and the orca saw to that.
I insisted on going with them.
I feIt responsibIe for NoIan.
I had filIed his head with notions of whaIes being capabIe of grief, -
- which I beIieved, but aIso of caIcuIated actions, -
- which I doubted, despite aII that had happened.
Maybe I hoped I wouId interpret the animaI in a new way.
It seemed perverse to assume that, because the whaIe was inteIIigent, -
- it wouId aIso have our ugIiest emotion: vengeance.
I was sure of one thing, though.
His grief had made the orca unpredictabIe. I feIt obIiged-
- to protect both it and NoIan from that insanity.
NoIan seemed sure of what wouId happen. That frightened me.
He set our course for the exact spot where he kiIIed the femaIe.
He was sure the creature wouId come.
Excuse me ...
Shouldn't there be a look-out?
He's not ready yet.
That's your gun.
Oil the patch.
- l don't shoot whales.
- lf he gets me, you'll have to.
- Do you really think he'll get you?
- No, l said ''if'. lt's him!
- That's his first contact.
- How should l steer?
- This is exactly what l thought.
- l'll go in the look-out.
- Where are you going with that gun?
- What do you mean? lt's me he wants to fight.
Put down that gun.
Steady as she goes.
Stand by for a depth charge.
- You can't let off dynamite!
- Do you want me to dive overboard?
- Don't!
- Hands off.
Get your head in.
Here he comes!
What the hell is he up to?
He wants us to follow him.
Umilak! Change course.
Starboard.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, l'm fine. l don't know whether to scold you or thank you, but what's done is done.
Ken!
What's he telling you?
''You're me,'' he's saying.
''l'm you.''
''You're my drunk driver,'' he's saying.
They'll want us to turn back now. lt's too late for me. l'll take over from Paul.
Okay, Paul, l'll take her. l wouldn't have believed it, hadn't l seen it.
That course just threaded us straight to the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
- Like he had radar.
- Sonar, actually.
Did Nolan radio back what happened to Ken? l don't know. lf he did, we would have been ordered back to the port.
You're getting as crazy as he is, Rachel.
Turn in now, Paul.
Try not to dream.
- lt's dead on.
- On what?
The Strait of Belle lsle.
The open sea.
He's taking us out of the gulf, to the coast of Labrador. l feel this is the last lap.
- There's no way out north.
- lce can crush this boat in seconds. lce cuts both ways.
He'll have to crash up through it -
- to find air.
This whale is not as smart as l thought he was.
- Come and ram us, you crazy fish!
- Take it easy.
You're doing exactly what he wants you to do.
He normally follows his victim for two weeks before he hits it.
Here, read it. Page 77.
He's trying to drive us crazy.
He's already done it with you. l've checked the fuel.
There's not enough to take us home.
We can pull up at a gas station.
No more wisecracks.
We don't have enough to get home.
There's a radar station northwest of Seahorse Point.
You can send an SOS. They'll lift you out with a helicopter.
Lift us out?
What about you?
Me?
With the growing coId came a growing quiet.
From the crew, from NoIan, everything.
It was numbing Iike the chiII, and paIpabIe.
The orca moved north, and we foIIowed.
We didn't speak about Ken's death, or about our pIans.
AII NoIan said was that the orca was reeIing us in.
But we were Iow on fueI, -
- and NoIan didn't seem to give thought to fight or flight.
The creature Ied,
NoIan foIIowed.
If there were a purpose to what we were doing, onIy the orca knew.
Engines astern!
- What are you doing?
- l'm swinging the lifeboat out.
- lt can get carried away.
- We'll take that chance.
Get up here and swing that light, and find me a clear way.
- Are you joking?
- Find me a passage!
Nolan ...
You're tired. Get some sleep. l'll take care of him.
- l think Nolan's right.
- About what?
- The boat's more secure inboard.
- Well, that's what makes horseraces.
Come, l'll warm you.
Do you remember?
Some time ago, you asked me -
- how much l'd make from the whale. Do you remember that?
All l wanted was enough money -
- to pay off the boat.
Go back to lreland.
America never suited me.
Now look what l've done.
Three people dead.
An innocent girl maimed for life.
God forgive me ...
Tomorrow will be the day.
He loved his family more than l loved mine. l won't be needing this. lt's going to be a fair fight on equal terms. l'm taking over.
We're going back.
Now!
There's an iceberg coming towards us. lt's moving against the current.
Umilak, start the engines.
Get me the harpoon.
He has to come up for air.
Go on.
SOS ...
We'll leave our signal on automatic.
Thank you.
Stand back now.
Behind you!
Here, catch!
What in hell are you?
Shoot!
Who's that bloody fool on the grey?
Someone who wants to be noticed, I should imagine.
He'll be noticed.
He'll get his head blown off.
My Early Life by Winston Spencer Churchill.
On the 16th of September, 1897, at the age of 22,
I found myself taking part in a punitive expedition of the Malakand Field Force on the northwest frontier of India.
In a sense, I had arranged for my participation in this action myself.
August the 5th, 1897.
A letter to General Sir Bindon Blood:
"Sir, I do hope you will not be annoyed if I remind you that you once promised me that when you had your next command, you would try to find a place for me".
"Very difficult. No vacancies.
Come up as a correspondent.
We'll try to fit you in. Blood".
Now, which of these gallant chaps will lead me to something really exciting, an adventure I can write about?
That column there?
Or that one? It's all a lottery, isn't it?
Just luck.
God, I hope I'm lucky today.
The jok e of it all is that I never really wanted to be a soldier.
No. Politics, parliament, that's my arena.
But how am I to get there?
I have no reputation, no family in the government.
And worst of all, no money.
Ah, money. My darling mother wrote to me often on that tiresome subject:
"Really, Winston, you are simply irresponsible about money.
I am sending the man the 11 pounds he asks, but why will you write cheques when you have no money in the bank?
Actually, in America, you know, it's illegal.
And they sentence people to long terms in jail for doing it.
My dear, do be careful.
And do write when you can.
Please, please, don't tak e any unnecessary risks.
Your loving mother,
Jennie Randolph Churchill".
Who's that bloody fool on the grey?
Can't tell.
Someone who wants to get noticed,
I should imagine.
He'll be noticed.
He'll get his head blown off.
Sir!
Lieutenant Churchill, sir.
4th Hussars.
Actually, I'm here as a correspondent.
Pioneer and Saily Telegraph.
I wonder, if you're going to that village up there, would you mind awfully if I came along with you?
Ah yes. Churchill,
4th Hussars.
Actually, we don't care much for correspondents out here, Churchill.
Or white horses, either.
Where'd you get him?
Uh, in the auction last week, sir. Malakand Pass.
Previous owner killed?
I believe so, yes, sir.
Didn't that teach you anything?
Sir?
Well, come along if you like.
But keep out of the way.
Thank you very much, sir.
Oh, one more thing.
We do try to bring our wounded back.
These chaps can be very nasty.
But as you're only an onlooker,
I can't guarantee anything. Understood?
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
The truth is, I'm not at all brave. in fact, the truth is, I've often felt myself a coward, especially at school.
But if I could win a reputation for courage and daring, if I could be mentioned in despatches, that would help me to get started in politics.
In short, I need medals.
Lots and lots of medals.
And I have to learn so much, and there's so little time.
I have to read all the books
I should have read before.
I must become my own university.
And I must overcome my speech impediment when I speak in public.
The Spanish ships
I cannot shee... See.
For they are not in shite... Site.
Samn!
Move it!
Is everybody gone, sir?
All gone, sir.
Very well, then.
Carry on.
Carry on!
Number three section, follow me!
Wouldn't you know it?
All this way for nothing.
Talk about rotten luck.
Right, we'll start back now.
Keep a dozen men, will you, and cover us till we get halfway down, will you.
Then we'll cover you.
Right.
Come along, Mr. Cartlidge, we're going back now.
Very well, sir. Come along and huddle it up.
Bring them down.
Head's up.
Lieutenant general, come with me.
It's not bad at that.
Could be worth two or three hundred words.
Get back. Get back!
Willy! Come on, get out of there.
Come down!
We'll cover you!
Fall back!
Fall back!
No, sahib, leave me.
Oh, sahib, you're hurting me.
Sahib, let me go!
Oh, please, on my knees,
I am begging you.
Come on, you idiot, get out of it!
Get out of it!
" And to conclude these despatches, the general in the field wishes to mention and commend the courage of
Lieutenant W L S Churchill, who made himself useful at a critical moment".
And thereupon,
I sat down and wrote a book.
And the literary critics were most kind to me:
"If General Kitchener should ever find time to read Mr. Winston Churchill's new book, The Malakand Field Force, it's fascinating to imagine the great warrior's reaction to it.
The book is excellent for a first effort, but perhaps its title should have been:
Some Helpful Hints for Generals
From a Young Lieutenant".
Hurry up now, sahib, the train is about to leave.
For some reason unknown to me,
I have always been charged with being unpunctual.
But then, in my lifetime,
I have constantly been accused of many wick ed things.
Perhaps I paid for all those sins, real or imaginary, in advance, for when I was but 7,
I was cast out of my happy home, and sent away to school.
I left behind me all who were dear to me, especially my nurse,
Mrs. Everest...
Winnie, bye-bye! who look ed after me and tended all my wants, and to whom I poured out all my troubles.
And for some reason
I cannot now remember,
I called her "Womany".
And when I went away,
I think I missed her most of all.
"Searest Mother, my white horse has been a marvellous investment.
Everyone noticed me.
The news here is that Kitchener is going to fight the dervishes in the Sudan.
Mother, darling, you must use all your influence and charm to get me into his command".
My American mother always seemed to me a fairy princess.
A radiant being, possessed of limitless riches and power.
She shone for me lik e the evening star.
I loved her dearly.
But at a distance.
Nevertheless, it was my father who was the greatest and most powerful influence on my early life.
He was the second son of the Suk e of Marlborough and a Tory member of the House of Commons.
Good morning, good morning.
Unfortunately, if my mother had little time for me in those days,
I saw and spok e to my father even less.
He numbered among his friends, some of the most important men in parliament, and indeed in all England.
Men lik e Lord Salisbury, the leader of the Tory party, which was then in opposition.
His nephew, Arthur Balfour.
And Joseph Chamberlain.
And even I knew that one day, when the people came to their senses and swept the Conservatives back into power, it would be these men who, together with my father, would form the government.
No Lord Rothschild?
Are none of your Jewish friends to be with us today, Randolph?
No, I didn't think it would be fair to them.
You know how easily bored they are.
Winston.
Thank you, sir.
Now, we enter this in your name.
So...
And then you can purchase anything you like from the school shop.
Up to the limit of your credit, of course.
I'm afraid Winston doesn't quite understand about money yet.
We shall teach him.
This young man will be very happy here,
Lady Randolph, I assure you.
I am certain he will.
Would you take tea,
Lady Randolph?
Well, I'm afraid I can't.
I shall miss my train.
Another time perhaps, when I come again.
You will be good, darling.
And you will write, won't you?
Yes, Mama.
And so, young Churchill, here we are.
Come along.
Yes, sir.
I am going to tell you something
I shall want you to remember always.
Your school days are the most important days of your life.
How you get on here will determine precisely how you get on in the world.
Succeed here, and you will succeed as a man.
Fail here... and you will be a failure to the end of your days.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Your father is a great man.
Be like him in all things.
Now, you wait here while I see about getting you settled in.
Have you had any Latin?
Latin? No, sir.
Hmm.
While I am gone, learn this.
This, on the right-hand page.
When I return... we shall see how well you have done.
They are ready for you.
Come along.
Now, then, have you learnt it?
I think I can say it, sir.
Then please do so.
Mensa: a table.
Mensa: O table.
Mensam: a table.
Mensae: of table.
Mensae: to or for a table.
Mensa: by, with or from a table.
Very good. Come along.
Excuse me, sir, but what does it mean?
It means what it says.
Mensa: a table.
Mensa is a noun of the first declension.
There are five declensions.
You have learnt the singular of the first declension.
Yes, sir.
But what does it mean?
I have told you.
Mensa in Latin means "a table".
But it means
" O table" too, sir.
And what does " O table" mean?
"Mensa: O table" is the vocative case.
O table.
You would use that in addressing a table, in invoking a table.
You would use it in speaking to a table.
But I never do, sir.
Churchill, in this school, if you are impertinent, you will be punished and punished, let me tell you, very severely.
Come along.
McSweeney,
P J M W.
" He exhibits rather too relaxed an attitude towards the disciplines of academic life.
Gamma".
Stand forward,
McSweeney.
Mr. McSweeney, I shall be obliged if, after this assembly you will take your customary step through my study door.
"Sear Mama, I hope you are well.
I'm very happy at school.
I do wish you could come and visit me one day soon".
"He gabbles his translations and is dirty with his written work".
Step forward,
Stuart MacKenzie.
May, A C W.
Stand forward, Mr. May.
Mr. Belcher tells me in this report that you suppose noise to be an effective camouflage for inattention.
You will shortly give me your attention in the study, where we will explore your capacity for making noise.
Mr. May, you're first.
... which is, in my view, essential.
Oh, come, come, it really is time the Honourable Member stopped trying to introduce bogus bills in order to prevent action on bona fide ones.
Mr. Speaker!
Mr. Speaker, I protest!
Those words should be taken down.
Hear, hear!
Mr. Speaker, I agree.
I wholeheartedly agree.
Those words should be taken down.
Will the gentlemen of the press please take these words down?
It really is... time the Honourable Member stopped trying to introduce bogus bills!
"Sear Papa, how are you?
I am well.
Mr. Churchill!
I am very happy at school.
I had a nice birthday. Thank you ever so much for the present.
I know you're ever so busy, but it would be ever so nice if you could come one Sunday".
And when the next election came, my mother married an American flav our to the proceedings.
Mind your skirts, dearie.
Good morning!
Good morning.
Good morning.
Are we new in the neighbourhood, ma'am?
I must say, I don't recall the pleasure.
Well, you've come to the right place to save a bit of money.
It never hurts to do a little shopping yourself, I always say.
And learn your way about, in effect, ma'am.
What can I do for you, ma'am?
Actually, I want to talk to you about the election.
My husband, Lord Randolph Churchill, is standing for this constituency.
And I'm helping him to get elected.
Oh, uh...
Ma'am, in this constituency in effect, we vote as we please.
And we don't like people coming round asking us for our votes.
Furthermore, I never discuss politics with women.
Even ladies, ma'am, begging your pardon.
In... In... In... In effect.
But I want your vote.
How am I to get it if I don't ask for it?
Indeed.
Well, that's a point.
Quite so. You...
You have a point there, ma'am.
It is a point, but it's no use.
I'm a life-long liberal.
Besides, I don't hold with lordships lolling about the House of Commons.
No. Horses for courses, I say.
Lords for lords, commons in the Commons, in effect, ma'am.
But my husband doesn't loll.
He never lolls.
He works very hard.
That's why he isn't here and I am, in his place.
In effect.
Oh, and what time, may I ask, does His Lordship arise in the morning?
Most days, about 11.
You see, the House sits at night.
Sometimes very late.
He st... He stays in bed till 11?
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am
I could never vote for a man who lies abed until 11:00.
That is the end of it, ma'am. Good day.
Good day.
Just a moment.
Doesn't get out of bed till 11, does he?
Well, ma'am, looking at you now, it's a wonder to me he bothers to get out at all.
Good day to you, ma'am.
Good evening.
Welcome home, milady.
Thank you, Evans. Betty,
Marlene. Is Lord Randolph in?
No, milady.
Oh. Where's Everest?
I'm here,
Lady Randolph.
If I might speak to you?
Now, please.
When did this happen?
Have you called the doctor?
We shall be taking him out of that place.
Won't we, milady?
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lord Randolph Churchill,
Secretary of State for India.
Lord Randolph. Many people give you the major credit for the return of the Conservative Party to power.
Yet there is a rumour that you tendered your resignation to the prime minister,
Lord Salisbury.
I trust I am not here to exchange gossip or to encourage a rumour.
But you will not deny there is friction between yourself and Lord Salisbury.
I refuse to discuss that any further.
To put an end to it, let me say that I have never run away from a fight when I believed it necessary.
But I am and always will be loyal to the Tory Party.
Mind you... some of my friends in my own party have a great lesson to learn.
The Tory Party will never remain in power until it gains the confidence of the minorities and the working classes.
Because the working classes are quite determined to govern themselves.
Ah, yes. Your theory of Tory democracy.
It is said that there are few who take it seriously.
Really?
Yes. After all, as an aristocrat it's difficult to accept you as an advocate of democracy.
Many people think you use it as a device to make yourself prime minister in Lord Salisbury's place.
Do you?
Not at all.
Good.
Recently, you've expressed strong views on the state of the Irish question.
Ah, well...
The Irish question...
That, I'm afraid, will never be solved.
Quite.
Now, Lord Randolph, on a more personal note, you and Lady Randolph, the former American heiress Jennie Jerome, are leaders of society.
Your racehorses are most successful, you entertain lavishly, and His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales attends your dinners frequently.
And Lady Randolph and you are identified with all that is new and fashionable.
Your splendid home here in Connaught Place is one of the few to have electric lighting.
How do you find it?
Do you prefer it to gas?
Well, it's all rather up-to-date, I suppose.
That thing in the cellar...
I think you call it the dynamo.
...is rather noisy.
The lights will keep going out always at the wrong times.
No, I don't think that electric light will ever replace gas.
At least, not in private houses.
No, no.
I believe, Lord Randolph, you have a son.
What? Yes, actually.
Two.
Two sons,
Winston and Jack.
No doubt, they're very proud of their father.
Oh.
That thought had never occurred to me.
I had scarcely passed my 12th birthday when I entered the inhospitable regions of examinations, through which, for the next seven years
I was destined to journey.
These examinations were a great trial to me.
I should have lik ed to be ask ed to say what I knew.
They always contrived to ask what I did not know.
This sort of treatment had only one result:
I did not do well in examinations.
Begin.
This was especially true of my entrance examination to Harrow.
I wrote my name at the top of the page.
I wrote the number of the question: one.
And after much reflection,
I put a brack et around it.
But thereafter, I could not think of anything connected with it that was either relevant or true.
Incidentally, there arrived from nowhere in particular a blot and several smudges.
I gazed for two whole hours at this sad spectacle.
Then, merciful ushers collected my piece of fool's cap with all the others and carried it up to the headmaster's table.
Longhaired boy in the second row.
It was from these slender indications of scholarship that Mr. Welldon, the headmaster drew the conclusion that I was worthy to pass into Harrow.
It is very much to his credit.
It showed that he was a man capable of looking beneath the surface.
A man not dependent upon paper manifestations.
I have always had the greatest regard for him.
Happy Christmas, Lord Randolph.
Thank you.
And to you, my boy.
Well, Mr. Buckle, a visit from me to The Times at this hour must be a surprise to you.
Oh, The Times has learnt never to be surprised by Lord Randolph Churchill.
Then, perhaps, this will surprise you.
This is a letter from you to the prime minister.
That is correct.
But it's a letter of resignation from the cabinet.
That is also correct.
Lord Randolph.
You have taken me into your confidence by showing me this letter.
I ask you...
I beg you not to send it to Lord Salisbury.
I already have.
That's a copy.
Then I urge you to withdraw it.
That's not possible.
Lord Randolph, once before you threatened to resign and the prime minister retreated.
This time, he will stand firm.
Really?
Forgive me if I seem to be taking a liberty, but for you to resign now, to leave the government at this time, on this issue of the budgets for the army and navy would be a tragic error.
You must not do it.
I have no choice.
I'm pledged to economy up to my eyes.
I gave my word.
How can I accept this flagrant misuse of public money?
May I say that public money has been wasted before and the nation has survived.
As I understand it, every one of your colleagues in the cabinet is willing to accept this bill.
Then why do you feel it necessary to resign?
Because in addition to being leader of the House of Commons,
I'm also chancellor of the exchequer.
I am responsible for the country's money.
Why resign? In protest?
The country will not be grateful. After all, isn't this a matter of national defence?
Withdraw this resignation.
At once. Now.
The prime minister has already accepted it.
I have his letter here.
Mr. Buckle, I came to you, rather than any other editor in the hope that you, of all people, would give me your support.
I see.
The Times has criticised the government when we thought it necessary.
But we will not lend a hand toward bringing it down.
Will you, at least, publish both my letter and the prime minister's reply?
No.
Both letters are private communications between you and Lord Salisbury.
To publish his letter,
I would have to have the prime minister's permission.
That you will never get.
I presume I shall see the news in tomorrow's edition of The Times?
Yes. Tomorrow.
Randolph!
Randolph!
Randolph.
Randolph.
Quite a surprise for you.
It is true.
It must be. It's in
The Times, isn't it?
Last night, you knew.
You knew then, and you didn't tell me.
When you said you were going to the club, you were going to The Times.
I saw no reason to spoil your evening.
But you've worked so hard.
Yes, I'm very tired.
Why don't we take a holiday?
We've arranged to be home at Christmas.
We have engagements.
Mr. Moore, my lord.
Oh, dear, yes.
Show him in, will you?
Good morning, Lady Randolph.
Good morning, Mr. Moore.
Lord Randolph.
Yes, it's quite true, Moore.
Now, be a good fellow, have a cup of coffee with us.
No, thank you. I...
I just came to tell you that if I can ever serve you in a private capacity,
I would be honoured.
Very kind of you.
Do sit down.
Thank you, no. I...
I really must go.
I'll see you to the door.
I'll see myself out,
Lady Randolph. I...
In all my 20 years in Her Majesty's government,
I have never served a more able or more brilliant minister.
He has flung himself from the top of the ladder.
He will never reach it again.
Winston, hurry up.
The dev oted Mr. Moore had a heart attack and died shortly thereafter.
I can see my father now in a somewhat different light than I did in those days.
I have long since passed the age when he died, and I understand very clearly the suicidal nature of his resignation.
My mother remained, as always, loyal and steadfast.
A light on Marmion's visage spread
And fired his glazing eye:
With dying hand, above his head
He shook the fragment of his blade
And shouted, "Victory!
Charge, Chester, charge!
On, Stanley, on!"
Were the last words of Marmion.
"Searest Mother and Father, two weeks from Monday there is to be prize-giving in the Speech Room.
I have memorised 600 lines from
Macaulay's Lays of Ancient Rome, and if I can get
1000 lines by heart, which I will do,
I am bound to get a prize.
So will you please both come down?
Everyone will be there.
And it would mak e me so happy if you were there to see me win a prize.
You have never been down to see me at Harrow. Either of you.
And this would be a perfect time.
So, dearest Mummy and Papa, please, please, please, do, do, do come.
Your loving son,
Winston S. Churchill".
And under that great battle
The earth with blood was red
And, lik e the Pomptine fog at morn
The dust hung overhead
And louder still and louder
Rose from the dark ened field
The braying of the war-horns
The clang of sword and shield
Come in.
Oh, Dr. Roose, do come in.
Thank you.
He is better, isn't he?
Oh, do sit down.
I shan't be a moment.
Will you have a cup of coffee with me?
Lady Randolph, I should like you to meet Dr. Bluzzard, whom I have consulted.
But I thought he was getting better.
I am sorry to have to tell you, madame, that your husband is very ill.
You must, I fear, prepare yourself for the worst.
Dr. Bluzzard.
We agreed to be frank with Lady Randolph, did we not?
Frank, yes. But I see no necessity to be brutal.
What is it?
What are you talking about?
Lady Randolph, it is my sad duty to tell you that Lord Randolph is suffering from an incurable disease.
From which, at the most, he will die within five or six years.
Stop!
What are you telling me?
You're talking about a man who is only 38 years old!
Lady Randolph, please believe this is extremely painful for us.
Do sit down.
May we?
Lady Randolph,
I am a specialist and what I have to tell you is,
I am sorry to say, beyond question.
But what is the cure?
There is no cure.
But what is it?
Why don't you tell me?
Let us call it... an inflammation of the brain.
In the years to come, although he will seem to recover, although he will seem from time to time to be perfectly normal, in fact, he will deteriorate consistently.
He will suffer paralysis in his limbs, and his speech will become impaired. As will his mind.
There will be periods of violence.
I am sorry, believe me.
But it is necessary for you to know.
Is it true?
It can't be.
It isn't true, is it?
Yes.
Yes, I'm afraid it is.
Oh, my God.
Randolph.
Does he know?
No. And in our opinion, he should never know.
Lady Randolph?
Yes?
How recently have you had physical relations with your husband?
Why do you ask?
Forgive me, but it is a matter of some importance.
I beg you.
Hmm.
Not for a considerable period.
If it is necessary for you to know... perhaps not for... a considerable time.
Thank God.
Yes. Thank God.
Neither you nor the two boys are in any way affected.
But I'm afraid there must be no further physical relations between you and your husband... ever again.
Good morning, Mother.
Good morning, Father.
Good morning, Winston.
Winston!
Go to your room and stay there until you learn how to behave in a civilised manner!
Yes, Father.
Don't you think that was a little excessive?
His manners are atrocious.
I know.
But most boys are ugly and tiresome at his age.
To the best of my memory,
I was always fairly presentable.
I do not recall grunting at table like a pig on heat.
Randolph, we haven't seen much of Winston this past year.
And he does worship you.
You were right, of course.
But you were a bit harsh.
Nonsense.
You don't really think that, do you?
Well, if you ever spoke to me like that...
I'd feel as if you didn't care about me at all.
Of course.
Perhaps I should have a chat with him.
Oh, that would be nice.
Yes, I think I'll do it now.
Why don't you finish your breakfast?
No. Now would be best.
Father.
I'm awfully sorry, Father.
I'll be better. I promise you, truly.
I'm sure you will be.
We won't talk about it anymore.
Thank you, Father.
You know, Winston... the world of politics can be very difficult sometimes.
And I have my share of problems these days.
The things I do are misjudged.
Things I say are often distorted.
Perhaps that's why
I'm so often bad-tempered.
Oh, no, Father. You're a great man.
Everyone knows that.
Everyone knows Lord Salisbury treated you very badly.
And you'll show him.
All of them.
Thank you.
Thank you, my boy.
Anyway, I think... older people aren't always particularly considerate to younger people, to children.
They forget what it was like when they were children.
And sometimes, when they're bad-tempered, they speak more harshly than they think they are or mean to.
Yes, I know, Father.
Well, I think there have been times when I have done that.
Perhaps this morning.
But I would never... wish you to feel that I don't care for you very much.
Because I do.
Thank you, Papa.
I mean, Father.
I say, Winston, your collection has become most impressive, hasn't it?
You're rather short of artillery, aren't you?
Yes, Father.
Only five field guns.
Yes, well. Now, that's not really...
It was one of the three or four long, intimate conversations with him which are all I can boast.
He spok e in the most wonderful and captivating manner.
Then when he inspected my troops, he displayed such a knowledge of military affairs that it would have astounded me had I not already been aware of his breadth of mind.
Winston.
When you grow up, would you like to go into the army?
Would you like me to, Father?
No, it's what you would like that counts.
Well...
I'm awfully good at history.
Especially about wars and battles and generals and...
Yes, Father,
I'd like to very much.
Very much.
Good.
We'll talk about that again later.
There's an army class at Harrow, isn't there?
I'll have a chat with Welldon, see what he thinks.
Yes.
Goodbye, Winston.
Goodbye, Father.
Womany.
Womany!
What is it, for heaven's sake?
Father talked to me for the longest time.
And he was so kind.
And I'm going into the army!
The army?
The army?
He's our son, but we mustn't blind ourselves, must we?
He's no scholar.
Can you imagine him qualifying for the bar or cutting any kind of figure in politics?
So unless you see him in the church...
You see, the army's all that's left. I think it's an inspiration.
We have to get him into Sandhurst.
And that, of course, means passing the examination.
The army.
Well, that's three or four years off, anyway, isn't it?
Unfortunately, it took not one, but three examinations to get me into Sandhurst.
Come in.
Did my letter come, Father?
I've been accepted.
I passed.
You seem very pleased with yourself, Winston.
I'm afraid I don't share your satisfaction.
But I passed.
Yes, you passed.
There are two ways of passing an examination, Winston, one that does you credit and one that does not.
As usual, you have chosen the latter.
Seventh from the bottom of the entire class.
But I did pass.
Yes. You passed... but you failed to get into the infantry.
You merely scraped into the cavalry, which everybody knows is the mark of a third-rate pass.
Now, that will cost me an extra...
200 pounds a year to get you a horse.
And this after all the months of cramming, and all the trouble I went to with the duke of Cambridge to get you into 60th Rifles, one of the finest regiments in the British army.
But I only failed the infantry by 18 marks, Father.
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You are sorry?
Winston, how many times have I heard that word from you before?
You've had every possible advantage.
Your mother and I have done everything possible to make life easy for you.
Remember how you behaved at Eton?
Eton? You mean at Harrow...
Your reports. They've been nothing but an embarrassment to me.
"Untidy, slovenly, bad, lazy".
You're my greatest disappointment.
You lie, you shirk, you boast!
You care nothing for anyone but yourself, Winston.
Ever since you were a child, you've been... a problem to me.
Nothing but trouble and heartache.
What's to become of you, boy?
No, you're no longer a boy, you're 20. You'll be 21...
No, Father, I... I'm 19.
Don't interrupt me, Winston, please!
Winston... if you do not change your ways at Sandhurst... if you do not face up to your responsibilities like a man... if you don't buckle down, Winston...
I can accept no further responsibility for you after your 21 st birthday.
If you don't change... you'll become just another... public-school failure, social wastrel... living out a shabby and a miserable life to the end of your days.
Do you understand me,
Winston?
Yes, Father.
Nevertheless, once I became a gentleman cadet,
I acquired a new status in my father's eyes.
And, when I was on leave,
I was sometimes allowed to go about with him.
I dearly loved these outings.
I had no idea that he had less than 18 months to live.
Lord Randolph.
General.
Good afternoon, sir.
This your boy?
Yes. Winston.
Winston, you have the privilege of meeting
General Bindon Blood.
How do you do, sir.
Sandhurst, eh?
Good, good.
See you in India one day, right?
I hope so, sir.
I'd like to serve under you someday, sir.
I mean, in the field, sir.
You like a bit of gunpowder, do you? Good, good.
Well, young fellow, you do well at Sandhurst... and if ever there's another war, which I doubt, worst luck...
I'll find a place for you.
I give you my word.
Ambition's a good thing in a young man, Winston, but one mustn't be too pushy, you know?
Yes, Father.
Hello, Joe.
Randolph.
I was going to write to congratulate you on this young man's maiden speech.
Excellent, Austen. Made a fine impression on the House.
Thank you, sir.
You should be very proud of him, Joe.
Yes, I thought it was a reasonable effort.
You've grown, Winston.
Be an officer soon, eh?
Hope so, sir.
Hmm.
Father, I... I've been thinking.
Yes?
Arthur Balfour is
Lord Salisbury's nephew.
They're very close, and he helps Lord Salisbury a lot.
And now that Austen
Chamberlain's an MP, he must be a great help to his father.
I was just wondering...
I mean, when I have some leave, couldn't I help your secretary?
I mean, you were your father's secretary for a while and...
They fancy Rosebery's gelding in this race.
He's a handsome-enough fellow.
The breeding's there, but there's something lacking in the stamina.
You know?
Character.
No, I don't see him winning the race.
It was not... so long ago...
Excuse me. in terms of the calendar...
Excuse me. Hello. honourable members...
Hello, how are you? may recall I made... a previous statement.
A previous statement... made by me... on a previous occasion... honourable members may recall.
And so I repeat... if I may... on that...
On that o...
On that o... Occasion...
On that occasion... honourable members may recall I...
Her Majesty's government...
Her Majesty's government... are spending huge amounts of money... on army and naval operations.
They are doing so...
They are...
They are doing so without regard to the pledges they made to the country.
Without regard.
They are doing so... without regard to the pledges they made to the country.
Without regard... to the will or voice of parliament.
That's what I said.
Must have... had a reason.
Come along, old friend.
He was only 46.
Had he lived another four or five years, he could not have done without me.
But all my dreams of comradeship with him, of entering parliament at his side and in his support... were ended.
We buried him near Blenheim... where both he and I were born.
His friend Lord Rosebery wrote of him:
"He was human, eminently human... full of faults, as he himself knew.
But not base or unpardonable faults.
Pugnacious, outrageous... fitful, petulant... but eminently lovable and winning".
Not a bad epitaph, at that.
Nor one I should mind having for myself.
Now, there remained for me... only to pursue his aims, and vindicate his memory.
Parade... present arms!
Colour parties, halt!
Parade... shoulder arms!
I passed out of Sandhurst with honours.
Eighth out of 150.
I mention this only because it shows that I could learn quickly enough the things that mattered.
Victoria, by the grace of God,
Queen, Sefender of the Faith,
Empress of India... to our trusty and well-beloved
Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill, gentleman, greeting.
We, reposing a special trust and confidence in your loyalty, courage and good conduct, constitute and appoint you to be an officer in our land forces with the rank of 2nd Lieutenant.
Four months later...
I lost the one person who had never failed me.
Elizabeth. Elizabeth it's Winston.
Do come in.
Winston.
What a good boy you are... to come and see your old Everest.
You've grown.
It's the army.
Do you think they'd take me?
I'm afraid I'm not much good anymore.
Oh, you'll get better,
Womany. You'll see.
I was thinking this afternoon about your father.
Do you know what he did?
When I retired,
I gave him my savings... and he made a special trip to the city... to talk to Lord Rothschild about investing them for me.
Now, wasn't that kind?
And he, with so many cares of his own.
Oh, they were cruel to him.
Lord Salisbury... that Arthur Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain.
Supposed to be his friends.
Broke his heart.
You're wet.
You're soaked through.
It's raining.
You came in the rain? You must take that off. You'll catch cold.
No. It's all right.
No, no. You must take that jacket off and you must dry it.
Please, dearie.
All right, Womany.
In just a moment.
Your boots aren't damp, are they?
No. No, they're dry.
Oh, good.
It's what gives you toothache, you know.
Sitting in damp boots.
I know.
Are you enjoying the cavalry, dearie?
Very much, Womany.
Very much.
Next! Arms up.
Next!
Arms up. Next!
Walk on!
Outward turn.
Both rides outward circle!
Sit up! Look up!
Two. Forward.
One.
Back to your riding position.
One! Two!
Three! Four!
And one! And two!
And three! And four!
Down the centre.
Walk on.
Come along, Mr. Churchill, sir.
You'll have to do better if you want to go to India.
"Mother, darling, India has nothing more to offer me.
And now that you, unfortunately, have lost most of our money in that American stockmark et swindle,
I really must go to the Sudan with Kitchener.
I could write another book or sell some articles.
So, please, please, talk to everyone you can.
By the way, I have met the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.
Her name is Pamela Plowden.
We are going to do a tour of Hyderabad tomorrow on an elephant.
You have to ride on an elephant because if you walk about, the natives have a habit of spitting at you and crowding you into the gutter.
Mother, darling, you won't forget about Kitchener, will you?"
"Sarling, as you ask ed,
I have written to General Kitchener, and I should be getting his reply soon.
You will be pleased to learn, I know, that the Prince of Wales is reading your book".
I cannot resist writing you these two lines to congratulate you on the success of your book.
Everyone is reading it.
But your dear mother tells me you are thinking of resigning your commission and standing for parliament.
I hope you will not do so.
You have plenty of time before you... to mak e your name and your friends in the army.
And now to Sir Ian Hamilton,
Lord Roberts, Lord Curzon,
Sir Evelyn Wood,
Lord Cromer, the Prince of Wales, the prime minister and Lady Randolph Churchill.
Say that I insist on the privilege of selecting my own officers.
Say, as I've already said not once but many times before,
I have no room for Churchill. None!
Say that...
Just arrived, sir.
Say that time grows short and I have a great many more important things to think about and that the matter is closed finally, definitely and forever.
And I don't want to hear any more about it.
You'll... You'll dress it up, of course.
Certainly, sir.
Lady Randolph Churchill, widow of
Lord Randolph Churchill, formerly Miss Jennie Jerome of New York and Paris.
You play, if I may say so,
Lady Randolph, most beautifully.
It has been said that you could appear on the concert stage if you desired. And you've given us ample proof of that skill.
Thank you.
It has also been said, no doubt with malice, that you interest yourself a great deal in your son Winston's affairs... and in his advancement.
But I should be a most unnatural mother if I didn't.
Of course.
But there are those who find an interesting contrast between your efforts on his behalf now and your neglect of him when he was a child.
Neglect?
But that was never the case.
That is vicious and hurtful.
My son never lacked a mother's love.
Naturally, when he was a child, he went off to school. The very best of schools.
At home, he had my attention and a marvellous nanny who was with us almost from the time he was born.
Naturally, I was at the same time devoted to my husband's career, as any wife would be.
I see.
You do, on occasion, entertain or act as hostess for the Prince of Wales.
His Royal Highness finds you charming, gracious, amusing.
You are at liberty to think so.
But if you are insinuating the slightest impropriety...
Not at all, dear lady. Not at all.
Please be calm.
I am perfectly calm.
Then we can proceed.
You are aware, of course, that your name has been linked with another royal personage...
Count Charles Kinsky, the well-known sportsman.
I don't know what you mean by "linked".
We are friends.
We have been friends for many years.
Yes, friends.
Exactly.
Friends. Yet, at one time, there was gossip, malicious, of course, that your marriage to Lord Randolph was, shall we say, pro forma.
And that in the event of a divorce, you and Count...
There was never a possibility of divorce.
But you and Count Kinsky are still friends?
Yes.
Charles was married shortly before my husband died.
Three weeks before, in his own country, in Austria.
He has remained there ever since.
He has great responsibilities there.
One last question.
What precisely was the nature of your husband's last illness?
It is well-known.
It was caused by overwork.
Ah, yes. But the symptoms were most curious, were they not?
I don't know what you mean.
But surely you were aware of your husband's symptoms?
I think this has gone far enough.
But this is of great interest to the public.
Is it? Why should it be?
Why should it be of any concern to what you call the public?
The public is everyone.
And the public has a right to know.
Why? What right?
I don't know anything about such a right.
I only know about the right to some decent privacy!
Oh, come, come, Lady Randolph.
We live in modern times.
Surely the word " syphilis" need hold no terrors for us.
Are you content?
Have you heard?
We've had a death.
Young Chapman.
21 st Lancers.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Pity. Just when he was going out to the Sudan too.
Yes.
So we have a vacancy, don't we?
Yes. You know,
I was wondering.
What?
What about young Churchill?
Are you mad?
Well, why not?
Well, firstly, if the general twigged, he'd have our balls for breakfast.
And secondly, why?
Surely you don't have any use for that little publicity hunter.
None at all.
But his mother's a smasher.
Yes, I know.
I say, you dog.
Do you know her?
No.
But I'd give anything to meet her.
So, come on, what do you say, hmm?
There's not a chance in the world the old boy will ever...
War office to
Lieutenant Churchill:
"You will proceed to the 21 st Lancers at your own expense.
In the event of injury to yourself or your horse, no charge will be made against army funds.
Sign here, please.
Three copies".
"I say, Churchill, we at the
Psychical Research Society have an interesting experiment in mind... which, as a journalist, should interest you too.
If you should, unfortunately, get killed will you try to communicate with us?"
Forward, halt!
Uh, Chapman!
I say, Chapman?
Chapman, are you deaf?
Oh, sorry, sir.
It's Churchill, sir.
Oh, yes, of course, Churchill.
Chapman's the one who's dead.
Hmm. Sorry about that.
What condition's your horse in?
First-rate. Not tired, if that's that you mean.
Oh, good. Now, you're the one who wants to see a show, aren't you?
Report up forward to Colonel
Martin. He'll tell you what to do.
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
Oh, and Chapman...
I mean, Churchill my compliments to the colonel.
Yes, of course, sir.
Sir. Lieutenant
Chapman re... Churchill.
Sorry, sir. Um...
Lieutenant Churchill reporting from Major Finn, sir.
Come with me.
Sir.
Your horse reasonably fit?
Yes, sir.
I've a message I want you to deliver.
But I want you to see the situation for yourself so that you can describe what you've seen.
Sir.
Now, our estimate is something approaching close on 60,000.
Though it may not seem like it, they're coming on pretty fast.
I want you to report on what
I've told you and what you've seen personally to General Kitchener.
Oh, God!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mean, yes, sir.
You all right, Chapman?
Yes, sir.
What do I say?
"Lieutenant Churchill reporting to
General Kitchener"? He'll kill me!
He'll send me home.
He'll have me court-martialled.
He'll skin me alive before the entire army.
I'll be ruined.
Oh, my God!
Oh, well. I died for my country.
Sir, I come with a report from the 21 st Lancers.
The Dervish army is advancing... between yourself and the city of Omdurman.
Colonel Martin estimates their strength in the region of 60,000.
I saw them 40 minutes ago.
They're moving rapidly.
They're moving rapidly, you say?
Yes, sir.
How long do you think I've got?
I would say an hour, sir.
Possibly an hour and a half.
An hour and a half should be about right.
I hope.
Fire!
They're breaking, sir!
They're breaking!
Suring the mopping-up operations the next day,
I took part in what was destined to become the last full charge ever of British cavalry.
Sound the trot.
Sound troop to the right.
Sound the charge!
Charge!
Charge!
Charge!
Bloody hell!
Mr. Winston Churchill war correspondent, author, recently resigned from the army and candidate for parliament for Oldham at the age of 23.
Twenty-four, actually.
In November.
Thank you,
Mr. Churchill.
There is gossip that you were detested in the army... where it is said you were known as a medal hunter, a publicity seeker and a social climber... pushing, aggressive and scheming.
Forgive me. I'm sorry.
I was wondering why a certain kind of person always seems to believe the worst about me.
At Sandhurst, for example,
I was accused of being everything from a horse thief to a homosexual.
And I had to sue for libel, and win, to prove my innocence on both counts.
As to what you have just said,
I'm sorry to hear it.
I thought I had served my country faithfully... at some danger to myself.
Yes.
Some officers have stated that your criticism of General Kitchener in your new book, The River War, was inexcusable.
Have you read the book?
No.
Then perhaps you should read it.
My statements concerning his atrocious treatment of enemy wounded were entirely factual.
As to our victory, although the enemy had superior numbers, they were no match for a modern army.
I see.
Your father also had a weakness for offending people, did he not?
I wouldn't call it a weakness.
I would describe it as his strength.
And I would attribute it to the strength of his convictions.
My father was a brilliant man.
He had no time for fools.
Yes. Actually, you were not very well acquainted with your father, were you?
Not as well as I should have liked to have been.
However, solitary trees... if they grow at all, grow strong.
Indeed.
Something you've read?
No. Something
I have written.
In my new book,
The River War.
You really should read it.
There are some good things in it.
Reverting to your father's enemies, do you imagine they will welcome you into politics?
I don't know what you mean by "enemies".
Oh, come now! Lord Salisbury, who kept him out of government.
Mr. Balfour, who supported
Lord Salisbury. Mr. Chamberlain, who destroyed your father's last chance of returning to power.
And the others.
They were never enemies.
They may have disagreed at times but that's the nature of politics, isn't it?
Lord Salisbury has been very kind to me.
I dedicated my book to him.
Then you feel you have no cause to fight for in your father's name?
No wrong to right?
No vendetta to keep alive?
Vendetta?
That's an Italian word, isn't it?
Nothing like that in England, is there?
Why are you so friendly with David Lloyd George, who is a Liberal?
I like people.
People who can help you?
A young man starting out in life needs help.
But don't you think in these times, politics has little room for wealthy and privileged young men?
I am not wealthy.
I live on what I earn.
And I support my mother and my younger brother.
But why exactly do you wish to stand for parliament, Mr. Churchill?
To serve my country.
And to advance yourself?
Yes. Is there anything wrong in that?
Is there anything right in it?
Who are you to aspire to the greatest parliament in the world?
What do you have to offer, other than your ego and your ambitions?
Only myself.
I believe in myself.
I believe in my destiny.
Really?
Have you consulted a fortune-teller recently?
As a matter of fact, I have.
She agrees with me.
Is it a crime to be 24?
No, no. Not at all.
What would you like me to do? Play games?
Be seen but not heard?
Close my eyes and ears?
Be a child forever?
Must we always be ruled by old men?
Doesn't every old man in politics betray the wonderful things he believed in when he was young?
And by doing that betray his country?
I think there is room for a young man... many young men, in government.
If I could, I would say this to young men all over the world:
" Come on. You are needed more than ever now.
You must take your places in life's fighting line.
Twenty to 25, those are the years.
Don't be content with things as they are.
Yes, you will make mistakes.
But as long as you are generous and true, you cannot hurt the world.
Nor even seriously distress her.
She was made to be wooed and won by youth.
She has lived and thrived only by repeated subjugations".
Well...
Something else you have written?
No.
No, it's something
I'm going to write, I think.
Really?
In your autobiography, no doubt.
Yes.
Yes, I think I will write an autobiography someday.
I think I'll have something to write about.
Yes. Well...
The Oldham Evening Chronicle:
"Young Mr. Winston Churchill's first attempt to enter politics has met with defeat.
He has left for South Africa as a correspondent to write about our war with the Boers".
In South Africa,
I had the good luck to encounter a Captain Aylmer Haldane, whom I had met in India, and who had befriended me there.
He invited me to go out on a reconnaissance with him in an armoured train.
Going back?
This is as far as our orders take us.
Seems quiet enough.
Let's go and have a spot of breakfast, shall we?
You know, Haldane,
I've been thinking.
After the Malakand Field Force,
I went on to the Tirah expedition.
Do you remember?
Yes.
Well, I never did get my medal for that.
Now, if you were to write to the war office...
A medal for the Tirah?
Winston, don't you ever relax?
I can't. I'm almost 25.
Down!
Look out!
On the left!
Carry on, sarge!
Enemy left!
Steady now, lads. Take aim.
Take aim! Good.
Brakes!
Come on, lads.
On your feet!
Take it easy.
Get up! Take posts!
Haldane, we're off the rails!
Shall I go up front and see what I can do?
Good idea!
Set up, boys!
On target.
Shoot!
Hey, where are you going?
I'm a civilian.
I don't get paid for being shot at!
Come back here!
Come here! Listen!
Let go!
Listen! You've got more chance of being hit if you run. Now listen to me, I'm a soldier.
No one ever gets shot twice on the same day. That's a fact.
Now you get back in there!
It's the safest place there is.
And when this is over, you'll get a medal.
That's a promise.
Come on! I'll go with you.
Can this engine still run?
Well, it might.
But the track's blocked, we can't move. Unless we get uncoupled from that truck in front of us.
Come on, get in.
And get it over on its side.
I see.
And there's no way of doing that.
We can try.
Is there an officer here?
Yes! What is it?
We have to uncouple that truck there and push it over on its side!
Sergeant, bring a dozen men.
Very good, sir!
Who was that? A Boer?
Worse than that.
He's crazy!
Come on. Give him a hand.
Heave it up from underneath.
Right.
It's moving.
Come on! Out you come!
Outside!
Come on, that's it, lads!
Move it now! Move it! Come on!
You men, over here!
Right, come on.
Get your shoulders under here.
Come on, men!
Come on down!
Come on, there!
Heave!
Come on! Heave!
Heave!
Hold it!
Keep it up!
Hold it up!
Heave!
Get it up, men!
Heave!
Push it!
Right, take cover!
Come on!
Did it, by God!
You didn't get it off the track.
You said all we had to do was get it uncoupled and push it over.
It was too heavy to get off the track.
Well, I'll have to ram it off now.
Well, ram it off!
I don't know if the engine'll run.
Well, try it!
Good. Now, go ahead.
I'll have to back her up first.
Well, then bloody well back her up, you idiot!
Well, you don't have to get excited.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Right. Now, go ahead.
And you keep shovelling.
Yes, sir.
We could go off the rails, you know.
Go on!
Here.
Sorry...
But go on!
Oh, Christ!
Haldane!
Haldane!
Move, fusilier!
Move, move, move!
The track up ahead's clear, but we can't get back to you.
And anyway, the couplings are smashed.
Yes, I know.
I know, I know.
Can we load the wounded onto the engine?
Yes.
Well, that's something, I suppose.
The rest of us have to go on foot.
Thanks very much,
Winston. I'll remember this.
So shall I.
Wounded onto...
Onto the engine!
The rest of us go on foot, using it as cover.
Come on, everyone out now!
Wounded on the engine!
Get the wounded onto the engine!
Come on, move it on! Move it on!
Easy, easy!
Move around!
Move around!
All right?
I think so.
All right, go ahead!
Go ahead!
As slow as you can.
Slow down, Winston!
Slow down.
Slow down!
You're getting ahead of them.
It's all right. All right.
Winston!
Slower!
Slow down, you damn fool!
For God's sake, Winston!
Hey, slow down.
Oh, shut up!
Slow down, you damned idiot!
I can't, you silly arse.
We're on the downgrade.
I'll kill you!
I can't help it.
The brakes are gone.
Now what?
I must go back and get Haldane.
What, back there?
What do I do?
You wait!
You wait ten minutes. And then if you don't see us coming, you can go.
Pretoria.
"We have captured Lord Churchill, who claims to be a war correspondent.
But from our intelligence, we know he was responsible for one part of the armoured train getting away".
Sir, I am a special correspondent.
I was unarmed, and I took no part in the fighting when I was captured.
I respectfully submit that I should be released as soon as possible.
On no account is he to be released, for the duration of the war.
I've been watching you two.
You're working on an escape.
You're out of your mind.
I am not.
But I will be if you won't take me with you.
Never.
Be quiet, Brockie.
We can't use you,
Winston.
You don't know the country or the language.
If we got separated, you wouldn't have a chance.
Anyway, you'd be the first to be missed from here.
Play.
Haldane, I'm going mad in here.
And tomorrow's my birthday.
Congratulations.
Oh, shut up. You don't understand.
I'll be 25.
I can't stay cooped up in here for the rest of the war.
Please, Haldane.
You said you'd remember what I did that day.
Do you remember now?
I wouldn't have been caught if I hadn't gone back for you.
No.
Do shut up, Brockie.
I can't think.
What's for dinner tonight?
Any idea?
They're too close.
You're afraid.
Well, see for yourself.
I'll go and look too.
No, no, wait...
It was maddening.
And besides, normally there was only one guard on duty here.
The thought crossed my mind that we were suspected.
Suddenly, I felt it was now or never.
And the impulse was too overpowering to resist.
But how was I to inform my comrades?
Then I heard a heavenly sound.
Psst.
Who's there?
It's Churchill. Keep quiet.
Churchill? Where are you?
What are you doing out there?
Never mind.
Just go and tell Haldane and Brockie right away.
Oh, I get it. Good show!
London, The Morning Post.
"Our special correspondent,
Winston Churchill who distinguished himself before his capture has, in a fashion as yet undisclosed, escaped".
Johannesburg.
" A reward of 25 pounds is offered for the capture of Winston Churchill.
Sead or alive".
Pretoria.
" Although Mr. Churchill's escape was cleverly executed, there is little chance of his being able to cross the border.
When he is recaptured, it is probable that he will be shot".
My name is Dr. Bentinck.
I've had an accident.
Now, what did you say?
Are you English?
Never mind.
What do you want?
Oh, I've had an accident. I...
I fell off a train.
Well, the truth is,
I'm afraid I'm lost.
All right.
Come in.
Now, then,
I think you'd better tell me the real truth.
I think so too.
My name is Winston Churchill.
The correspondent from The Morning Post.
I escaped from Pretoria last night, and I'm making for the border.
I have 75 pounds.
Will you help me?
By God, it's lucky you came here.
Only house for 20 miles where you wouldn't be handed in.
My name's Howard.
I'm British.
I'm the manager of this mine.
There are three more of us keeping the place going.
The Boers keep an eye on us.
There were some here this afternoon.
Looking for you.
Well, then, perhaps I'd better go.
Nonsense.
We'll just have to be extremely careful.
Have a drink,
Mr. Churchill.
Thank you,
Mr. Howard.
This is our engine man,
Mr. Dewsnap.
Stay with him for a moment while I get the food and blankets.
Are the others ready?
Waiting down below, sir.
I know who you are.
You're young
Winston-bloody-Churchill.
Don't worry.
I'm from Oldham, you see.
Me wife writes to me regular.
She told me how you got beat at last election.
Don't worry, lad.
You'll get all their votes next time.
Right. Come on, now.
Watch your step here.
Don't trip over the tracks.
Round the other side.
I couldn't bring much food.
The housemaids are all Boers.
Can't take the risk.
Take one of these, lad.
Ever been down a coalmine before?
I think you'll find it an experience.
Not very comfortable,
I'm afraid.
But you mustn't move away from here, whatever happens.
I'll try to bring you more food tomorrow. You'll be all right, won't you?
Of course. It's very cosy.
Just like home.
Well, Mr. Howard, gentlemen, thank you very much.
Our pleasure.
You've been shamefully careless with this watch, Winston.
The repair bill was very expensive.
If you can't tak e proper care of a fine watch, you don't deserve to have one.
Yes, Father.
I remained underground for three days and nights, while the brave Mr. Howard planned how to spirit me across the border to Portuguese East Africa, from whence I could tak e ship to British territory.
Thank you,
Mr. Dewsnap.

Churchill has been recaptured, dressed as a woman".

I'm free!
I'm free!
I'm Winston-bloody-Churchill!
And I'm free!
Ladies and gentlemen... a man who, after his daring escape, rejoined the army of his country, distinguished himself again and again in battle... helped to free his fellow officers from the very same prison he escaped from.
I give you...
Ladies...
Ladies and gentlemen of Oldham.
Friends.
I promised
Mr. Daniel Dewsnap, without whose wonderful help
I should not be here tonight... that the first time
I returned to Oldham,
I would give his love to his wife.
She's here!
She's right there!
And thus, at my second attempt, the Tory electors of Oldham sent me victorious into the mother of parliaments.
The Times.
"In raising his amendment against the government's bill on military expenditure, young Mr. Winston Churchill in his first major speech seems bent, after one short and promising year in the House on repeating the most disastrous mistak e of his father's career".
I don't understand.
I wish I could understand.
Does it really matter?
Yes, it does matter.
It matters very much to me.
I never understood your father when he did what he did, throwing his life away.
And now you're doing the same thing.
Only this time, I know in advance.
You're being dramatic.
I'm not throwing my life away.
But you are, my darling.
Everything you've worked so hard for.
I've had a note from Arthur Balfour.
No, thank you.
He says the prime minister's very angry with you.
Winston, you can't attack the three most important men in your party, in the government, and think that they'll forgive and forget.
You'll be finished after tonight.
We'll see.
Oh, Winston.
It isn't Pamela, is it? Because...
Pamela?
No, of course not.
Of course I loved Pamela.
Still do.
I'll never love another woman.
But she had every right and reason to marry an earl.
A " belted" earl, as you Americans say.
I do wish you weren't so friendly with Lloyd George. Such an odious little man.
He has the most annoying way of looking at women.
I'm sorry, darling, I must go.
Sign for me, will you, please?
Winston... for my sake.
I'm begging you.
Don't move your amendment.
Don't speak tonight.
Please.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Are you prepared to face these savage beasts who even now are lying in wait for you?
As prepared as I'll ever be.
Excuse me, sir.
Oh, I'll deal with this, Mother.
I intend to escort your son to the arena.
You're very kind.
Winston speaks of you often.
Oh, we are great friends,
I trust, despite our political differences.
Your presence in the House tonight makes it a special occasion.
I am sure it will inspire all the speakers.
And are you speaking tonight?
No, no. I shall be listening with great interest to your son.
Well, now, Winston,
I said I would escort you, so let us go.
I hope one day to escort him to the other side of the floor.
Heaven forbid.
Lovely lady, your mother.
Has she talked you out of it?
No.
He'll have your head. Lord Salisbury never forgets, as you should know.
Well, there'll always be room for you in the Liberal Party.
Why don't you quit the Tories and come over to us?
Never.
Good luck.
Excuse me.
... to a thorough sweeping and almost revolutionary reconstruction of the army, we have failed to rise to the hopes of the country.
Hear, hear.
Is there any competent authority who really believes that the right honourable gentleman has made the best of his opportunities?
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!
Hear, hear!
Mr. Churchill.
Mr. Speaker...
I stand here tonight to plead the cause of economy.
It may be, at some other time and under other circumstances
I may take a directly opposite position.
But tonight, I speak on behalf of military economy and retrenchment.
Hear, hear!
The secretary of state for war is asking... indeed demanding... a great deal of money.
I do not think he should have it.
I say it humbly, but with, I hope, becoming pride, no one has a better right to this position than I have.
For it is a cause
I have inherited.
And it is a cause for which the late Lord Randolph Churchill made the greatest sacrifice of any minister of modern times.
I am glad the House has allowed me... after an interval of 15 years... to lift again the tattered flag that I found lying on a stricken field.
It is quite recent history.
Lord Randolph was chancellor of the exchequer.
Lord Salisbury was prime minister.
As he is now.
And on this same issue of economy
Lord Randolph Churchill went down.
Forever.
But wise words, sir... stand the test of time.
And his words were wise.
I have frequently been surprised since I have been in this House to hear with what composure and how glibly members and even ministers... talk of a European war.
I say, sir, we must not regard modern war as a kind of game in which we may take a hand and with good luck and good management play adroitly for an evening.
And when we have had enough, come safely home with our winnings.
Hear, hear!
Oh, no, sir.
It is no longer a game.
A European war... cannot be anything but a cruel and heart-rending struggle which, if we are ever to enjoy the bitter fruits of victory must demand, perhaps for years the whole manhood of the nation, the entire suspension of peaceful industries, and the concentrating to only one end of every vital agency in the community.
Hear, hear!
Ah, yes.
It may be that the human race is doomed never to learn from its mistakes.
We are the only animals on this globe who periodically set out to slaughter each other for the best, the noblest, the most inescapable of reasons.
We know better, but we do it again and again, in generation after generation.
It may be that our empire too, is doomed like all those that have gone before it to continue to spill and waste its best blood on foreign soil no matter what we say or do in this place, or think or believe or have learned from history.
But thank God for us there is still such a thing as moral force.
And in spite of every calumny and lie, it is known that upon the whole...
And it is upon the whole that such things must be judged.
...British influence is a healthy and a kindly influence.
And so I say, sir... at this particular moment in history, we would make a fatal bargain if we allow the moral force which this country has for so long exerted to become diminished, or perhaps destroyed for the sake of the costly, trumpery... dangerous military playthings upon which the secretary of state for war has set his heart.
Hear, hear!
Hear, hear!
Hear, hear!
The Times.
"Mr. Winston Churchill's outburst brought forth some cheers but not, it should be noted, from his own party".
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
The Morning Post, London.
"Mr. Winston Churchill, last night served notice that there is a young lion loose in the House and the lion has sharp claws".
Well, well. Hmm.
I deeply suspect what you've done tonight, and yet...
I have to believe you were completely sincere.
And very brave.
You know, Churchill... you're a child of your class, and you may never outgrow it.
But you've got something.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I looked for you.
But when I couldn't find you...
I thought you might be here.
Well...
You think I still have a career?
We shall have to wait and see, won't we?
Hmm.
How do you feel?
Tired.
Tired but free.
It's odd. I feel free.
Sorry, darling, a brandy?
No.
I don't know.
It's like when I escaped.
When I first knew
I was really free.
It's odd.
Oh, Mother...
I saw a girl tonight.
Tall, fair-haired.
Rather lovely,
I thought.
Dressed in pale yellow,
I think.
You didn't see anyone like that in the gallery, did you?
Yes.
There was one young woman who more or less fits that description.
Oh?
Well, you know everyone.
You wouldn't...?
Well, yes.
As a matter of fact, I do.
You must mean
Clementine Hozier.
Your Uncle Jack Leslie almost dropped her in the font when she was christened.
Oh.
Did he, now?
Yes.
It was an end... and a beginning.
My darling mother continued on her headlong, headstrong, but always gallant and courageous way whilst, seven years later,
Clementine Hozier and I were married... and lived happily ever afterwards.
Long ago, the great Frith made the world.
He made all the stars...
and the world lived among the stars.
Frith made all the animals and birds...
and, at first, made them all the same.
Now, among the animals was El-ahrairah,
the Prince of Rabbits.
He had many friends...
and they all ate grass together.
After a time,
the rabbits wandered everywhere...
multiplying and eating as they went.
Then, Frith said to El-ahrairah:
"Prince Rabbit, if you cannot
control your people...
"I shall find ways to control them."
El-ahrairah would not listen,
and said to Frith:
"My people are the strongest
in the world."
This angered Frith, so he determined
to get the better of El-ahrairah.
He gave a present
to every animal and bird...
making each one different from the rest.
When the fox came,
and others like the dog and cat...
the hawk and weasel...
to them, Frith gave a desire to hunt
and slay the children of El-ahrairah.
El-ahrairah knew that Frith was
too clever for him, and he was frightened.
He had never before seen
the Black Rabbit of Death.
"My friend," said Frith,
"have you seen El-ahrairah?
"For I wish to give him a gift."
"No, I have not seen him."
So, Frith said,
"Come out, and I will bless you instead."
"No, I cannot. I am busy.
The fox and weasel are coming.
"If you want to bless me,
you will have to bless my bottom."
"Very well. Be it so."
And El-ahrairah's tail grew shining white,
and it flashed like a star.
And his back legs grew long and powerful.
He tore across the hill
faster than any creature in the world.
"All the world will be your enemy,
Prince with a Thousand Enemies.
"And whenever they catch you,
they will kill you.
"But first, they must catch you...
"digger, listener, runner.
"Prince with the swift warning.
"Be cunning and full of tricks...
"and your people
will never be destroyed."
Along the edge of that wood, there.
Enjoyed many a game pie from it, too.
You can't hold back progress.
Shame, though.
It's gone 8:00, and I told Elizabeth we'd go into Newbury this evening.
Old sun sets so late in summer, it's morning before...
I think it's safe now, Fiver.
There's still something strange about the warren this evening.
Is it dangerous?
It's not exactly danger. It's...
I don't know. Something oppressive.
Like thunder.
It seems safe enough now, though.
Come on, see if you can find me a coltsfoot. If you can't, no one can.
- What's going on?
- It's only that runt, Fiver.
Jumping at bluebottles again.
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Fiver found it, Toadflax.
And we'll eat it.
Coltsfoot are for Owsla. You know that.
Tell you the truth,
I'm getting sick and tired of it.
Sometimes I feel like clearing out of the warren altogether.
Never mind. Let's forget it, and try to enjoy the evening.
Hazel?
Hazel, this is where it comes from.
I know now that terrible thing is coming.
- What do you mean?
- Look.
The field! The field!
- It's covered with blood!
- Blood? Don't be silly.
All right, Fiver. It's getting dark.
- We should get back to the burrow.
- Back to the burrow?
It'll come there. Don't think it won't.
It's all around us.
Now, stop it, Fiver.
We've got to go away from here. All of us.
- Go away? What, the whole warren?
- Yes, before it's too late.
You're being silly.
They'll think you're out of your mind.
You must listen to me, Hazel.
Something very bad is going to happen.
We'd better try and see the Chief Rabbit.
You can tell him about it.
I don't expect he'll like the idea at all.
We've got to go away from the warren!
All of us!
- Go away?
- Yes, before it's too late.
Is something wrong?
- What's the matter?
- Is there danger?
Come on. Let's find out what's happened.
- Hazel? It is Hazel, isn't it?
- It is.
- What are you doing here?
- We want to see the Chief Rabbit, Bigwig.
"We"? You mean he wants to see him, too?
- Yes.
- I must.
- What's it all about?
- Bigwig? What do they want?
- They want to see the Chief Rabbit.
- What for?
- I have to...
- Send them away.
I'll take care of it, Holly.
Look, Bigwig, when have I ever asked to see the Chief Rabbit before?
All right.
Wait here.
Excuse me, sir. These two outskirts have asked to see you.
Is it all right if I bring them down?
Come on, then, though I'll probably get my ears chewed off for this.
Now, Walnut.
- It is Walnut, isn't it?
- No, sir. Hazel.
I knew your mother well. And your friend?
- My brother, sir. Fiver.
- Your brother.
Now, do tell me how I can help you.
Well, he says there's a bad danger coming to our warren.
A bad danger.
How very upsetting.
Now, what sort of danger, I wonder?
I don't know. But it's bad. It's so bad.
Well, now. What ought we to do?
- Go away. All of us. Now.
- Now? In May?
The mating season?
And where would we go to?
He's had these feelings before, and he's been right again and again.
I shall have to consider this very carefully.
Perhaps we'll discuss it later, in the summer.
We can't wait!
It's been good of you to come, Walnut.
Bigwig!
- Bigwig.
- Sir?
- What was that all about?
- Well, sir...
Your duty as an officer is to protect this burrow.
- Yes, sir.
- Those two lunatics...
Yes, sir.
- Who's that?
- It's me.
- Dandelion?
- No, Blackberry.
Dandelion told me you were leaving the warren tonight.
- If it's true, I'd like to come along.
- We'd like to come along, too.
- I don't much like the look of things.
- We must get everyone.
That Toadflax fellow followed me down the run.
It could mean the Owsla has been turned out tonight.
Then the sooner we're off, the better.
It's the Owsla. They're coming.
- There aren't many of you left, are there?
- Bigwig? Are you off duty?
Off duty, and likely to remain off.
I've left the Owsla.
Fiver, I've been thinking about what you said.
- We're leaving.
- Leaving? All of you? Where to?
We don't know exactly. But we're going.
- You're all under arrest!
- Under arrest?
- What do you mean?
- What for?
Spreading dissension, inciting to mutiny.
- There's a bad danger coming.
- It's not good.
You'll all come with me.
Is he alone?
I am captain of Owsla.
Go, now, or we'll kill you.
It's you who'll be killed.
- Bigwig!
- Yes, you know me.
- He'll come back with the Owsla soon.
- Right. Well, I think I'll come with you.
Hazel, we'll have to stop here.
Fiver and that other half-size, we're all in.
They need to rest.
He's right, Hazel.
Look. Once we're beyond the woods... we'll really be clear of the Owsla.
We can rest then.
I've never been in a wood before, Hazel.
It looks dangerous.
Follow me.
A lendri!
This way.
- It had just killed. I saw blood on its lips.
- Lucky for us, it had.
Otherwise, it might have been quicker.
- We shall have to cross it.
- Cross it? Who's going to cross it?
- What do you want to cross it for?
- Are you sure about this?
Yes. But I don't think I can swim, Hazel.
I'm worn out.
- Pipkin is even worse off than me.
- We can't just sit here.
I know what we ought to be looking for.
A high, lonely place with dry soil... where we can see and hear all around, and men hardly ever come.
- There's a dog loose in the wood.
- Well, that does it.
- A dog?
- Come on.
What do you think will happen when he picks up our scent?
Those that can swim, swim.
The others will have to make out the best they can.
That's not good enough.
We got into this together, we'll get out of it together.
Hazel, look.
It floats.
That's it. That's it!
Fiver, get on, quickly.
Silver, Bigwig, get your nose under it.
Push it out.
Quickly!
Keep still!
- Are you all right?
- Of course.
That was a good idea of yours, Blackberry.
Yes. Let's try to remember it.
Might come in handy again.
- Does anyone know where we're going?
- Hazel does, I'm sure.
I've never seen anything like that before.
- The man-thing killed it.
- A man-thing?
A hrududu. It runs on it.
- The what?
- The hrududu.
- It runs on it?
- Yeah, faster than we can.
- It's dangerous, then. It could catch us.
- No, no.
It won't take any notice of us at all.
I'll show you.
Watch this.
See? It's not interested.
What are you waiting for?
Well? Come along, then.
They need to rest, Hazel.
Something's up ahead.
A warm, friendly burrow, perhaps?
No, not a burrow. A field.
A great field of scented plants that will cover us until we're rested.
You're beginning to sound like a chief, Hazel.
- Hazel-rah.
- Hazel-rah?
That'll be the day I call him chief, that will.
Violet's gone.
We'd better keep moving.
We'll have to stop soon, Hazel.
They're frightened and tired.
Over there. We'll rest there.
Can't rest there. That's a man-place.
There are no men there now.
It looks all right.
What's happening back home, I wonder.
Think, when we lived in our own burrows:
Dry, soft, warm bodies.
- Now, look, we can't go on like this.
- It gets worse the further we go.
Where are we going?
It won't be much longer.
Then we can all rest.
- How much longer?
- We never should have left.
- Suppose Fiver's all wrong?
- We want to go back and find out.
Go back? After all we've been through?
And probably get killed for wounding
Captain Holly, an Owsla officer?
- Talk sense, for Frith's sake.
- We must go on, until we reach the hills.
Those that go back will not...
Not safe...
I don't believe you know where you're going.
Now, listen to me, you bunch of mole-snouted, muckraking...
It looks like you've come a long way.
Do you live here?
Yes, this is our warren.
We need to stay here for a while.
Why not? We supposed you would.
But I don't think there are enough of you to live very comfortably on your own.
There are enough of us to protect ourselves.
Don't get upset.
Who are you? What do you want?
My name is Cowslip, and I don't want anything.
Yeah, what about the others?
We have plenty of empty burrows, if that's what you mean.
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I hate the rain.
Funny smell.
We ought to have nothing to do with that Cowslip, or his warren.
It might be drier in there.
Whatever will he think of us if we don't go in?
- I'll tell you. He'll think we're afraid.
- Afraid? Who's afraid?
He seemed friendly enough.
What has he got to gain by asking us to join him?
We can't sit out here like fools.
Well, come along then.
They think I'm mad, but you know I'm not... and you still won't listen.
Hazel?
Come along, Fiver.
There's that smell again.
It's almost like man.
Oh, it's you, is it? How nice.
I'm so glad you've come.
This is rather a big warren.
Yes. Please, help yourself to flayrah.
There are fresh roots here daily.
The man throws it out.
Man? What man?
A lot of the burrows are lying empty, you know... so you're all welcome to any that you choose.
Where are all the others?
Please, eat all you like.
We'll leave you to your...
Where are they all?
Where? Try asking Cowslip
"where" anything.
They seem sad.
Like trees in November.
Well, I still think we've made a big change for the better.
Do you think the man puts the food out there because of a kind heart?
It's not poison.
There's something unnatural and evil and twisted about this place.
It feels like mist.
Like being deceived, and losing our way.
Some of us are gathering and suggesting stories.
- We're hoping you'll tell one.
- Hazel can tell you about our adventures.
How we had the good luck to join you.
Surely, there's no harm in that.
Dandelion, why don't you tell us the story of El-ahrairah?
El-ahrairah and his trickery don't really mean very much to us, charming as it is.
Rabbits will always need tricks.
No, we need dignity, and above all, the will to accept our fate.
As one of our poets is fond of saying, if I may quote...
- Yes, of course.
- Please, do.
"Where are you going, stream?
"Far, far away
"Take me with you, stream
"Take me on your dark journey
"Lord Frith, take me far away
To the hearts of light
"The silence, I give you my breath
- "My life, the silence"
- I've had enough!
- Where are you going?
- Away, to the hills.
By yourself, alone? You'll die.
- You're closer to death than I.
- Determined to ruin it for us, aren't you?
No!
Me, me, me. All the time.
"But, I'm in a mist."
- Bigwig!
- "Everything's bad!"
- No!
- "I've a funny feeling in my toe."
- No, no!
- I'm finished with you.
What's more,
I'm going to make sure everyone else is.
Bigwig, listen. You're in a snare. A snare.
Now, what did they tell you in Owsla?
Think.
No good biting wire.
Run to the warren and get the others.
Blackberry, Silver and Cowslip.
Be quick. He'll die.
Blackberry! Dandelion! Come quickly!
Come on. Hurry up. It's Bigwig.
He's still breathing. What can we do?
- We've got to loosen the wire somehow.
- Yes, but how?
- Is Cowslip coming? Maybe he knows.
- He wouldn't come.
- He told me to stop talking about it.
- He told you what?
This is it. The wire's on a peg.
We've got to dig it out.
The peg's narrower down there. It tapers.
I can't get my teeth into it.
Pipkin, you go in.
The splinters prick you.
It's hard to breathe.
The peg's nearly through.
Fiver, you go in.
I can't hear him breathing.
It's broken in two. It's free.
Bigwig, the peg's out. You're free.
I think he's gone.
We've got you out, Bigwig.
You're free.
- Bigwig, please don't die.
- It's no use.
We got you out.
What shall we do without him?
"My heart has joined the thousand
For my friend stopped running today"
You pay for it. The food, the warren. But no one must ever ask where anyone was... or speak of the wires.
The whole place is snared, everywhere.
- They left Bigwig to die.
- Silver's right.
Let's drive them out, take their warren and live there ourselves.
Yes. Back to the warren.
- Back to the warren.
- Embleer Frith, you fools!
That warren's nothing but a death hole.
Let's help ourselves to a roof of bones.
Who killed them?
Bigwig! You're alive!
- Are you all right?
- We thought you were dead.
- Let him alone. Let him rest.
- I don't have to rest.
- What do we do now, Fiver?
- Go away from here.
Look. Look.
That's the place for us. High, lonely hills... where the wind and the sound carry, and the ground's as dry as straw in a barn.
That's where we ought to be.
That's where we have to get to.
Pipkin.
Pipkin.
Pipkin!
Why don't we go and look around the farm?
Farm, Hazel? What for?
- Cats and dogs.
- I've got a little plan.
- Won't it be dangerous?
- Of course not.
- Is it safe?
- Of course.
- Let's all go.
- No.
Just you and me.
I think I see a dog.
Where? It's tied up.
Give it a wide berth. We don't want it to wake up the whole farm.
This is the BBC Home Service.
They are up. Hazel?
- Let's go back.
- Just a little further.
Rabbits. So, that's your secret plan.
I'm going inside to take a look around.
Is it safe in there?
Of course. You wait here.
- But if you see a cat...
- A cat?
- You will let me know at once, all right?
- Right.
I'm Hazel.
Hazel.
My name's Clover.
- Where do you come from?
- Far away.
My friends and I live as we please.
We eat grass, lie in the sun.
- Do you ever get out?
- Oh, yes.
Sometimes, a child takes us out on the grass.
- Would you like to join us?
- Join you? But how?
How can we join you?
Hazel! There's a cat outside.
I must go back to my friends.
But we'll be back, and any of you who wish can come along with us.
- Where is it?
- There. I think it smelt us.
- I'll get you away.
- Thank you.
- Just follow me closely.
- Yes.
- And run when I do.
- Run when you do.
You look hungry.
Rats getting too clever, I suppose.
I bet you can't run at all.
You pie-eyed, saucer-licking scrap-scraper.
Can you run?
You'll see.
I think not.
What's all that, then?
Tab? Tab!
Let them alone. Cruel thing.
What is it?
There's something coming up the line of the hedge.
- Can you see it?
- I hear it. It's something big.
- A cat?
- I don't know.
Bigwig!
Quiet. I want to listen.
Bigwig!
Bigwig!
It's the Black Rabbit of Inlè!
Don't talk like that. They'll go tharn.
We go by the will of the Black Rabbit.
- When he calls you, you have to go.
- Stay where you are.
- Who's there?
- All dead!
All gone!
It's Captain Holly!
- Holly, it's me, Bigwig.
- I found you.
I found you.
He's been hurt.
Look at that wound on his shoulder.
I remember you.
- You're the one that saw it coming.
- But what happened?
Our warren, destroyed.
Destroyed? How?
Men came. Filled in the burrows.
Couldn't get out.
There was a strange sound.
You see, the air turned bad.
Runs blocked with dead bodies.
We couldn't get out.
Everything turned mad.
Warren, herbs, roots, grass...
all pushed into the earth.
- Men have always hated us.
- No.
They just destroyed the warren because we were in their way.
They'll never rest until they've spoiled the earth.
I tried to find you.
I wandered for days.
The Efrafans wouldn't let me go.
They ripped my ear.
Ripped it.
I tried to find you.
Efrafans? What's he talking about?
Holly.
Let him be.
He's had a bad time.
He can tell us about it when he's rested.
A young doe has a request, sire.
A doe wants to see me?
Says she represents a group, sire.
I see.
- Your name?
- Hyzenthlay, sir.
Don't be frightened. You're safe here.
Get on with it!
Sir, several of us proposed an expedition to start... a new warren somewhere else.
- A new warren? Out of the question.
- But, you don't understand.
The system is breaking down.
Explain that.
We can't produce litters.
We're overcrowded.
I want no further discussion.
- We'll go as far as you like.
- Here or anywhere else.
Thank you, sir.
Campion, have her watched.
That's it, Hazel.
That's where we have to be.
Let me get this straight, Fiver.
- You want us to climb this, is that it?
- Yes!
Come on, Pipkin!
Come and look.
You can see the whole world!
I found a burrow, Hazel.
Under that beech hanger... with a great hall and no smell of death or disease.
Frith on the hills!
He made it all for us!
Frith may have made it, but Fiver found it.
- I've never seen anything like it.
- It's some kind of a bird.
Are you hurt?
Bigwig, I've got an idea.
- See if you can find some worms.
- Worms? Me, dig for worms?
What for, for Frith's sake?
I get up plenty soon.
- He's hurt and we want to help him.
- A bird? What for?
We help you.
Piss off!
What for help me?
What happened to you?
Damn cat jump me, farm cat.
We know her.
We take you to burrow.
Go away. Wing no good, but I walk plenty good.
- Is long way?
- Where you come from?
From big water.
My home by big water.
We go.
I thought everything would be fine once we got here, but it's not.
Because now we've got here,
I find it's not that simple.
What do you mean?
This place is as safe as Fiver said it was.
I think we've done very well for ourselves.
- But we don't have any does.
- Does?
Does.
Not one, and that means no kittens.
- And after we're gone, no warren.
- So that's why you went to that farm.
I thought we'd be able to get some hutch rabbits to join us.
What's to be done then, Hazel?
Set off again?
And where?
There's not been a sniff of another rabbit since we got here.
The bird, Kehaar.
We'll get the bird to search for us.
What home? This hole?
Where are mates? Where are chicks?
Mate make eggs, mate sit on eggs... hatch eggs, many eggs. We feed chick.
Egg robbers come, we fight.
You stupid bunnies!
You got no mates!
Where are mates?
Where are chicks?
Plenty trouble for you.
You need mates!
It's working, Hazel.
You got no brains. You no plan.
You need mate for plan.
Listen.
I got plan for you.
Wing better, I go fly.
Fly for you.
I find mates.
What a splendid idea, Kehaar!
How clever of you to think of it.
You very fine bird.
When will you be able to fly?
I fly any time. Stand back.
When I fly... Stand back.
Stand back. Back, back.
I need room.
Wings good.
Feathers clean.
I soar!
I glide!
I circle.
Then, I soar!
Bigwig said you couldn't make a friend out of him.
- He's probably gone back to the big water.
- I think you're right.
Blackberry, I want you to get Dandelion... and meet me here after the others are asleep.
- It's no good asking you not to go.
- It'll be perfectly safe, Fiver.
I'll take the greatest care.
Clover.
Clover!
Who's that?
It's me. We're back.
Hazel.
- What are you doing up there?
- I've come to let you out.
Will you come with us?
- We're all right here.
- Yes.
Good.
Come on.
Come on, move.
- Lucy's rabbits are out, look.
- Let's get them in, quick.
There's a wild rabbit, look.
There he goes.
Keep the torch on them.
I don't know, John, whether you hit it or not.
- I reckon he's in those nettles.
- Have a look, then.
I hit him, all right.
That's blood down there, see?
That don't signify.
He might be a long way off by now.
I reckon you've lost him.
No, we ain't.
Fiver, there's been some trouble.
Hazel's been shot.
No.
The Black Rabbit serves Lord Frith... but he does no more than his appointed task.
Hazel's not dead.
Perfect landing.
Hazel's been wounded.
The farm man shot him.
Come on, follow me.
Come on!
- You get black stones out?
- What do you mean?
Always with gun is coming little black stones.
You never see?
Take out black stones, he get better.
Let me see leg.
Many stones.
Did you find anything on your flight?
- Efrafa.
- Can you guide us there?
Many rabbits.
Too many rabbits.
We wouldn't be enough to fight one of their patrols.
What do you mean?
You see this? They did it to me.
It's an identification mark.
Tells you when you can be above ground.
- What do you mean? Who's to stop you?
- Their Owsla.
Their chief is called Woundwort.
General Woundwort.
I don't think even you would
match up to him, Bigwig.
Under him are captains,
each one in charge of a mark.
If you're found above ground
at the wrong time...
they take you before the council
for punishment.
Some of them must get away.
They caught one trying to run away
when I was there.
Blackavar was his name.
When they'd finished with him,
both his ears were ripped to shreds...
worse than this one of mine.
He was lucky not to have been killed.
There was another one, a doe, Hyzenthlay.
I couldn't have escaped without her help.
- Why didn't she go with you?
- She wouldn't go without the others.
Then some might be persuaded to leave?
Yes, but you'd never get them out of Efrafa.
You got out.
Only because Lord Frith
sent one of his great messengers.
I didn't see what happened to them.
It must have cut them down.
It's not going to be easy, but we don't have much choice.
- We'll start off as soon as I'm fit to travel.
- I don't like this idea of yours at all.
Holly, I want you to stay here.
You're known to them and it could be dangerous for you.
I've been in Efrafa, and I tell you you're making a bad mistake... that might very well get you all killed.
There's a homba.
No one move. Keep still, all of you.
- What's he up to?
- Trying to draw it off, I suppose.
Frith and Inlè!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on, hurry!
- Aren't you wounded?
- Never better! Let's go!
- What was that all about?
- I just lost my head, Hazel.
I've been strung up all day, thinking about Efrafa.
Anyway, I feel a lot better now.
Why did you cry out, if you're all right?
I didn't. I just stopped limping, you know, ready to run really fast... when I bumped into a group of rabbits, face to face.
I tried to warn them about the homba, but all they did was try to stop me.
One of them said, "You stay here."
So I knocked him down, I had to, and raced off.
- Next thing I heard was this squeal.
- So the homba got the other rabbit?
He must have.
After all, I led them right into it.
But I never saw what happened.
It's not to rest here, they come.
A patrol?
Yeah, is coming for find you, is go!
You go to river, then they not find you.
All of you, under that bridge unless you want your ears chewed off.
Yeah, come along.
By other side iron road.
I think maybe they no like for go across iron road.
Hazel, you go on.
This may be my chance to get into Efrafa.
But it's too...
All right, take care.
Now, Kehaar will meet you tomorrow, in that kale field.
Tell him what you've worked out.
Mr. Hazel, what wait for?
He's right, Hazel, you must go now.
We'll go down to the river and wait there for you to tell us what to do.
I want you to find some way to keep them from following us.
Go on now, before we're all caught!
It's a wide patrol. Be careful, Hyzenthlay.
Sir, we've picked up this hlessi and brought him in.
- Who are you?
- My name is Bigwig.
"Bigwig, sir!"
- What were you doing?
- I've come to join Efrafa.
- Why?
- Surprised you ask... sir.
Is there anything odd about wanting to join?
I'll ask the questions. What can you do?
I can run and fight.
- Fight, can you?
- I've been an officer in an Owsla.
So, you came to join us.
I thought you might have some use for me.
Well, for the time being, you'll be assigned a post in the patrol.
You'll take orders from Captain Campion.
If you want a doe, you have your choice here.
You're not an officer for nothing.
Thank you, sir.
And... you'll be identified by your mark.
Those Efrafans will be fast and savage.
I need to find a way to get away from them.
If what Holly says is true, we couldn't possibly stand and fight them.
Then we'll have to find another way.
What on earth is that, Kehaar?
Him fish.
Hazel, come and look at this.
What is it?
Is boat. Man make them go on water.
It floats, Hazel.
It floats.
Aren't you going to silflay?
I don't silflay at this time, sir.
Tell him why you're here, Blackavar.
I come here for the mark to...
I come here for the mark to see me... how I've been punished for trying to leave the warren.
The council were merciful.
He keeps trying to run away.
Captain Campion caught him this time.
His ears were ripped and he is to show himself... at every morning and evening silflay as an example to the others.
If you ask me, he won't last much longer.
He'll meet a blacker rabbit than himself one of these nights.
That doe over there, what's her name?
Fancy her, do you?
She's called Hyzenthlay, but look elsewhere, she's a troublemaker.
The council's got their eye on her.
You go now, talk to Bigwig.
Yeah, I go talk to Mr. Bigwig.
He'll be in field by arch on the iron road.
Go find him.
By the iron road? Yeah, I go and find him.
He'll tell you the plan.
He tell me the plan? I know the plan!
Now don't attract attention.
Of course not, of course not.
I be quiet. I be clever.
They no see me. Kehaar, Kehaar.
You wait here.
- Hyzenthlay.
- Sir?
I want to talk with you.
I am in the mark and under your orders, sir.
Do you remember a pale gray rabbit called Holly, you helped escape?
- You've made a mistake, sir.
- Listen, Hyzenthlay, listen carefully.
I'm from a warren where life is free, where you can live as you wish.
I've come to bring you out of Efrafa, as many as will come.
You might be a spy, sent by the council.
You know I'm not.
Will you join us, and persuade your friends, as well?
Trust me. My friends are not far away.
My courage, my spirit is so much less than it was.
We can escape from Efrafa, believe me.
Yes.
I think I do.
- Listen carefully.
- Yeah!
We're ready. We leave at sunset.
Ready good!
There will be lots of us.
We'll meet you at the iron bridge.
- When?
- Sunset.
Good! Good. Sunset.
Then you must guide us to the river.
- Plenty good trick.
- Trick, what trick?
Listen, if you see a patrol following us you must drive them away, terrify them.
Yeah, I fly at them.
Remember: sunset.
You plenty good fellow.
It's set.
When?
Get them to the near hind mark at sunset, just before early silflay.
- Suppose something happens?
- Nothing will happen. We can do it.
Yes.
I think we can.
Sometimes I can tell when things are true.
Sometimes I can see it.
A high down with trees and...
I've become foolish.
You'll have to meet this friend of mine.
He talks just like that.
We'll be ready.
Sunset, then. And a bird will fight for us.
- A bird?
- Even Woundwort won't expect that.
Bigwig!
That white bird you were talking to this morning...
- Talking to, sir?
- You were very close to it. Why?
Well, I've never been hurt by a bird.
That's not what I asked.
To tell you the truth, sir,
I think I was trying to impress you.
In future, stay in your own mark.
Sir.
One more thing:
What do you know about a homba?
- A homba, sir?
- You led it onto some rabbits?
I didn't intend to.
I didn't know they were there.
You didn't report it.
Everything out of the ordinary is to be reported.
I didn't know running from a homba was out of the ordinary.
That was a patrol on the track of a band of strangers.
Do you know anything about them?
I saw some tracks, but I can't tell you anymore than that, sir.
I'm taking out a wide patrol tomorrow.
We'll cross the iron road and try to pick up their tracks.
I want you to come along.
Yes, sir.
Campion, follow him.
Don't let him out of your sight.
I've been told to tell you early silflay has been canceled this evening.
No one told me anything about it.
Have a look over there and you'll see why.
Now, Blackavar.
The new officer, sir, he's gone.
Bigwig?
He's wounded Sherbil and taken a crowd of the mark with him.
I'll blind him. I'll blind him!
- Bigwig, where's the bird?
- He'll be here.
He'd better!
Where is that bird?
What I am doing here?
I am wait for long time.
Is no sunset. Is no good here.
Where are they?
They should be here by now.
Silver, go up to the iron bridge and see if you can find them.
They're coming.
Bigwig, the general!
What will we do?
It nearly came off.
We'll take one or two of them with us before it's finished.
Bigwig?
You traitors!
Campion, get this miserable group back to their marks.
I'll settle with you myself, Bigwig.
No need to take you back.
Come on and try, you crack-brained slave driver.
Get away, blast you!
Get away, you damned white bird!
Straight ahead, to the river.
Keep going, it's a friend.
- You did it, Bigwig. You did it.
- I did, didn't I?
It's not over yet.
They gone.
Keep going, down to the river.
- The general's behind me.
- Where do we go, Hazel?
I trusted you, Bigwig.
You can trust me now.
You'll either go into the river or be torn to pieces.
There's nowhere left to run.
Campion, Lily... when I give the word, we go straight into them.
- That bird can't save you now.
- There it is!
What you do now?
We're going back to our warren, Kehaar.
Good. You go, I go.
Is finish here for me.
- I go to big water!
- Take care of that wing.
Is winter plenty cold, then I come back.
Come back anytime.
And thank you, Kehaar.
Big water!
Get the holes filled in.
Everyone underground.
- What's the matter?
- The general.
- Where?
- The wood behind us.
- It's full of Efrafans.
- I'm not going back.
- Maybe we ought to leave.
- Anyone who wants to can go.
We went through a lot to get here, and I'm not leaving now.
Neither am I.
If I'm for the Black Rabbit, one or two from Efrafa will come with me.
We'll fill in the holes deep.
They'll have to dig us out.
They can't be out there long without attracting elil.
- The Efrafans will never give up.
- Maybe we should leave.
We're staying.
But there may be a better way.
- Let me come with you.
- No, they know you too well.
I'll go alone. Now, get those holes filled in.
I won't be long.
They'll take us back to Efrafa.
Their Owsla will.
Listen, we're not finished yet, not by a long shot.
You were one of those on the riverbank.
Did Bigwig send you?
I'm a friend of Bigwig's.
What was left unfinished on the riverbank will be finished now.
It would be better for both of us if we could come to terms.
Terms?
Very well.
These are my terms.
Hand over all the deserters immediately.
We couldn't agree to that.
But I can suggest something better, for both of us.
- You're in no position to bargain.
- We shouldn't be fighting each other.
We have enough enemies as it is.
Perhaps we should be together.
A joining of free, independent warrens.
I have no time for this nonsense.
- Shall I kill him, sir?
- No.
You take back our terms.
And you tell your chief, Bigwig, that if he and Hyzenthlay... and the others aren't waiting outside when I come for them...
I'll tear out every throat in the place.
Do you remember the rats in the barn?
We got out of that, all right.
Yes, we did. We got out of that, all right.
They're into the beech roots.
Start at this end.
- How cold!
- What is it? Are you all right?
I've tried to listen, only I can't hear it.
I'm going away, Hazel. I'm floating.
- Cold, how...
- Fiver. Fiver.
- Can you hear me?
- Listen.
They have something down there that's strange.
Get out, get out!
They had a great bird that turned into a shaft of lightning.
And there was another creature that took them away down the river.
- Here, I reckon we ought to go back home.
- Who said that?
- Nobody, sir.
- You were put there to dig. Get back to it.
Great Frith, stop him, Hazel.
The others are going tharn.
Wake up. Fiver, wake up.
There's a dog loose in the wood.
There's a dog loose in the wood.
"We need to cross
because there's a dog loose in the wood."
"There's a dog loose in the wood."
Bigwig, I need runners.
Dandelion, Blackberry.
Hyzenthlay can run.
Good. We've hardly any time.
I've got a plan.
If it works, it will finish Woundwort for good.
When we're gone, block this run and get everyone back behind the wall.
Hold them off as long as you can.
- Don't give in to them.
- Where are you going?
El-ahrairah will show me what to do.
Let them go.
It's their chief, Bigwig, I'm after.
Find their chief!
Hyzenthlay, you hide here.
When the time comes, get back to the warren.
- It will all depend on you.
- I'll be ready.
Lord Frith,
I know you've looked after us well...
and it's wrong to ask even more of you...
but my people are in terrible danger.
So, I'd like to make a bargain with you:
My life in return for theirs.
There is not a day or night
that a doe offers her life for her kittens...
or some honest captain of Owsla,
his life for his chief.
But there is no bargain.
What is, is what must be.
Blackberry, this is where we leave you.
Stay close and don't move.
Don't break too soon.
- Are you clear what's to be done?
- Yes.
You lie in the grass, just there, opposite him.
If we meet again, Hazel-rah... we'll have the makings of the best story ever.
And you'll be the one to tell it.
Can you run?
I think not.
I think not.
Tab! Tab!
I told you once,
I was trying to impress you.
I hope I have.
And I told you that I would kill you myself.
There's no white bird here, Bigwig.
Why throw your life away?
Hraka, sir.
Come out.
My chief's told me to defend this run.
Your chief?
Run! Run for your lives!
Come back! Come back, you fools!
Come back!
Come back and fight!
Dogs aren't dangerous!
General Woundwort's body
was never found.
It could be that he still lives his fierce life
somewhere else.
But from that day on,
mother rabbits would tell their kittens...
that if they did not do as they were told...
the General would get them.
Such was Woundwort's monument.
Perhaps it would not have displeased him.
El-ahrairah knew, then, that Frith was his friend.
Every evening, when Frith has done his day's work... and lies calm and easy in the red sky...
El-ahrairah and his children, and his children's children... come out of their holes and feed and play in his sight.
For they are his friends, and he has promised...
Hazel.
That they can never be destroyed.
Hazel.
- You know me, don't you?
- I don't.
Yes, my Lord.
I know you.
I've come to ask
if you would like to join my Owsla.
We shall be glad to have you,
and I know you'd like it.
You've been feeling tired, haven't you?
If you're ready, we might go along now.
You needn't worry about them.
They'll be all right...
and thousands like them.
If you'll come along,
I'll show you what I mean.
"All the world will be your enemy,
Prince with a Thousand Enemies.
"Whenever they catch you,
they will kill you.
"But first, they must catch you...
"digger, listener, runner.
"Prince with the swift warren.
"Be cunning...
"and your people
will never be destroyed."
It must be terribly sinful.
What?
Well, vanity is a sin, isn't it, Ann?
Well, if that's the only one, you'll do.
There.
Where are you going now?
I'm going to get some flowers to braid in your hair.
That was quick, Ann.
Did you fi...?
Ann?
Ann!
Ann?
And what crime have you committed?
I danced on a Sunday.
We're heading east.
That'll do.
Get on the wagon.
Happy birthday.
God bless you, my child.
And this to make it a happier birthday.
It belonged to your dear mother.
It was her last wish that you should have it.
Happy birthday, dearest sister.
It's wonderful... but I daren't wear it.
What if I were to lose it?
No fear of that.
That lock's as tight and cunning as a money lender.
May I go and show it to Petra?
May I, Papa?
Of course.
She'll be so envious.
Mind you, get back before dark, now.
What's your name, girl?
Carla.
I'm Grost...
Professor Hieronymos Grost.
Professor?
I profess to be.
What about him?
What's the "K" stand for?
Is he a king or something?
A king?
Yes, in a way, I suppose he is.
But the "K" stands for Kronos...
Captain Kronos, late of the lmperial Guard.
Well, if he's not a king, why does he leave us to do all the work?
He has to conserve his strength.
We've ridden far, and tomorrow we will be... where we must be.
And that's when his work will begin again.
Work? What-what work?
I'm turning in, Grost.
Where do I sleep?
We've only blankets enough for two.
Suit yourself.
Good night.
Isabella?
Isabella?
Isabella?
Isabella?!
Marcus?
Aye.
Dr. Marcus lives here.
Who wants him?
Marcus!
Kronos.
Marcus.
You ol' leech lover.
Who is he?
Him in there?
Your master.
His name's Kronos.
Captain Kronos.
And he's not my master.
I'm merely an old army friend passing through.
As you wish.
Your letter urged us to make all speed, but gave no reason.
Young girls suddenly become greatly aged.
Is that sufficient reason?
And these girls, they died with blood upon their lips?
Yes. Why?
Vampires.
What?
No, it can't be.
What he doesn't know about vampirism wouldn't fill a flea's codpiece.
Vampires.
Dr. Marcus, it is commonly supposed that a vampire attacks in only one way... by biting the neck and draining the victim of blood.
But that's true.
The girls you spoke of, they were not drained of blood but of youth.
Of life itself.
You see, Doctor, there are as many species of vampire as there are beasts of prey.
Their methods and their motive for attack can vary in a hundred different ways.
And the means of their destruction.
Aye, traditional stake through the heart does not always hold good, you know.
Some can only be destroyed by hanging or decapitation.
Or fire or water.
Or by other means.
But these girls were invulnerable.
Each one wore a crucifix.
The cross can only protect those who firmly believe.
But these were good girls from God-fearing families.
Perhaps their minds were not their own at the moment of attack.
I suspect mesmerism in this.
Mesmerism?
Hypnotism.
The subjugation of the mind.
Oh, you don't believe in that nonsense.
Well, it is highly improbable.
What could be more improbable than God?
But I believe in Him.
And I, too, but...
Thank you.
...vampires?
Oh, come now, Doctor.
You had already reached the same conclusion.
Or why else send for us?
Vampires... here in Durward.
I suppose you'll be moving on now?
No, I'm staying.
If you'll have me.
Oh...
I'll have you.
What is it?
What's happening?
Time for us to start work.
You want to come along?
What work?
Oh, didn't I mention it?
We're vampire hunters.
Professional vampire hunters.
Paul?
Dr. Marcus.
To my shame,
I'd completely forgotten.
I'd completely forgotten.
Seven years.
Is it so long?
To the day.
Days and years flit by like a whisper, taking its toll of all of us.
And healing old wounds.
For some, but not all.
Your mother still bears a grudge?
My father died in your hands, remember?
Yes, but of a plague, a virulence.
There was nothing I could do.
There was no hope.
I understand that, my dear, Marcus, but my mother...
She's there?
You must allow me.
My Lady Durward.
She will not acknowledge you, Doctor.
Paul...
Her face.
She's become so aged.
Your mother's sick.
She's ill.
With grief.
If only she would let me examine her.
She will see no one.
Least of all you,
Dr. Marcus.
Paul...
Good day, Doctor.
Paul?
Toad in the hole.
Not many more to do.
Mark the spot.
It's an old Chinese herb.
Herb?
I ought to be out scouring the countryside, chasing after phantoms.
Isn't that what you're thinking?
Never rush into a battle unprepared.
Remember, the war taught us that, if nothing else.
There's a time to think, a time to plan and a time to act, and that time will come soon enough, don't worry.
I see my needlework has held good.
Mm-mmm.
I know you've got guts, Kronos.
I've seen them.
Evening.
I play chess.
And I have a bottle of very good wine tucked away for a rainy day.
It's pouring.
Queen to king, and mate in one.
There was blood on the mouth.
In the church.
Blood on the mouth.
Just the mouth.
Why?
That's how he attacks them.
Through the kiss.
Oh...! Ooh...
Oh...
What's wrong?
I thought I saw someone over there.
Ah, you're imagining things.
No, there was someone.
Probably a forester.
No, it was someone old.
Someone very old.
I think it was a man...
Oh, really,
I ought to be going now.
I'll take you home.
And have my father see you?
He'd skin me alive and you, too.
Well, look, you can't go alone.
Not with everything that's been happening around here.
Now, look, there's the edge of the forest, and there's my house.
Now, what could possibly happen in that short a distance?
Ah, well, just the same,
I'll-I'll stay here and watch till you're out of the woods.
Silly.
Silly.
See you tomorrow.
Myra?!
Myra...
Myra.
Myra!
Another, and this time, we have an eyewitness!
I stood and watched her, and she was never out of sight.
Never completely out of sight.
But you saw no one else?
No one at all?
No. Oh, Myra thought she saw someone.
Who did she see?
Just someone very old, she said.
Very old.
You're mystified?
Mm!
Well, you've a right to be.
Grost ringed the forest with dead toads.
"If a vampire should bestrode
"close to the grave of a dead toad,
"then the vampire life shall give, and suddenly the toad shall live."
It's an old folk rhyme, and like most of them, there's a grain of truth in it.
"Then the vampire life shall give, and suddenly the toad shall live."
A coach or a wagon of some kind.
Recent, too.
Four horses.
Grost!
We'll ride over that way, take a look.
Look for what, someone very old?
On the contrary.
This thing attacks to sustain life, youth.
That's what we'll be seeking.
A cheek with a bloom to it.
Someone young and fair.
Fetch the horses!
Hmm... dead end.
What lies down there?
Oh, the village.
Oh, it's hardly a village.
Just a few houses and a tavern.
We'll try it.
It'd make better sense if I stayed and had a look 'round up here.
Whoa.
Now, there's a funny thing.
What's a funny thing?
That soldier fellow.
The chap who's staying with Dr. Marcus.
And what about him?
Going around asking if anybody's seen ought of a coach or a wagon
'round here in the past few hours?
Offering a golden guinea to anybody who can help him.
A golden guinea.
A man could buy himself a deal of pleasure with that kind of money, eh, Molly?
Aye.
Is Kerro here?
- He's around.
- Where?
He's upstairs.
With a doxy.
Here he is now.
Here, girl.
And that's double what you're worth.
You promised me more.
You promised.
And so I did.
You're not laughing.
Laugh.
Please, Kerro.
Laugh, I'm telling you.
I'll be damned if I will.
Laugh.
Louder.
Louder.
Oh, that's much better.
There's a good boy.
Bye.
Kerro.
When you talk to him, speak soft.
I'll do better than that.
I'll speak money.
Dr. Marcus... this is an unexpected pleasure.
Paul.
Good day to you.
I was just passing.
I thought the least I could do is to offer my respects to your mother.
And I shall be pleased to convey them to her.
But I doubt if she will even listen.
But a kind thought nonetheless.
Paul...
A brandy to warm you after your ride?
Thank you.
Mmm. It will be most welcome.
How is your mother?
No better.
But your dear sister,
Sara, she's well?
Very.
I'm delighted to hear it.
Your health, Doctor.
Thank you.
Witchcraft and Necromancy.
The book.
Oh, it was my father's.
At long last I'm setting his library to rights.
Witchcraft and Necromancy.
That's the rumor in the village.
Yes. A grim business.
What's your opinion of it?
My brother does not form opinions too readily, Dr. Marcus.
Oh, no.
He broods upon a problem a long time.
Is that not so, Paul?
You know I would not dare to disagree with you, dear sister.
My dear Sara, you look lovelier than ever.
And younger.
What's your secret?
Well, she's not exactly an aged crone, you know.
Nor ever will be.
"Crone" is such an ugly word, don't you think?
Such an ugly thing to be.
No, I don't think
I shall ever be one.
Am I unwell, Doctor?
You're studying me so closely,
I thought, perhaps, you could detect some malady in my face.
No, your face is perfect... magically perfect.
Magic?
Well, I must be on my way.
Sara.
Paul, thank you for the brandy.
Good day to you both.
Mother, you wanted me?
Yes.
Someone called just now.
It was Dr. Marcus.
Marcus?
What did he want?
He said he was just passing by.
Called to pay his respects.
Passing by?
This road doesn't lead anywhere.
I know, Mother.
I know.
Red wine.
The best you have.
Yes, sir.
Tell me, have you seen anything of a coach or a wagon passing by recently?
Nothing passes by here.
Only... soldiers... deserters, running away from the war.
Come in here with big talk of the battles they won... or with the look of lost battles about them.
What about you, Captain?
'Tis "Captain"?
Perhaps he stole the coat.
Tell me, did you lose your battles or win them?
A little of both.
And not enough of either.
You haven't answered my question.
Coach or a wagon?
Hey, you... crookback.
Tell me, uh...
...how do you sleep at night?
On your belly or... or in a hammock?
Or do you stick a hole in the ground and put your hump in it?
You see, we're interested, crookback.
His name is Grost.
Crookback will do for me.
But not me.
Why?
'Cause I don't like it.
Oh...
He doesn't like it.
To make sport of a physical affliction is both impolite and cruel.
After all, I wouldn't dream of calling you... rat face...
...fatty...
...or big mouth.
You still haven't answered my question.
Wagons or coaches, sir?
No, we haven't seen nothing like that.
We haven't seen nothing at all.
Pity.
Marcus.
Stand.
Dr. Marcus.
Sara?
Marcus.
They made sport of me, Kronos.
They laughed at me.
Am I so terribly ugly to provoke such mockery?
Am I?
Beauty fades, eventually, but a kind soul remains forever.
My mother taught me that.
She was a gifted woman.
Very gifted.
And you, my friend, my very dear friend, your body was given to you by God.
Just remember that.
He also...
...gave me a good friend to protect me.
They were paid to laugh at you.
Those men... they were paid to provoke a fight and kill us both.
Is that so?
If what you say is right, then...
It means we are getting close.
Ah. Where did you get to?
I rode over to the Durwards.
You saw nothing of a coach?
No. No, nothing.
What was it then?
A physicking or a visiting?
I hear that Sara Durward is quite a pretty bed-full.
It was just a social visit.
And you?
Gained nothing, save a fumed brain from too much wine.
Still, nothing like a leech or two... a little blood-letting to cool a man's veins, eh?
Better remove our little friends before they turn blue.
Blue?
I'm from very aristocratic stock.
We are casting our net further afield tonight, Doctor.
Do you want to come along?
Yes.
Good.
I will be looking for something like these.
Only a little bigger.
She has touched nothing.
She just lies there, like a thing already dead.
I never knew such grief.
She must have loved Father very much.
Sara, perhaps if you were to go to her...
I can't.
I'm sorry, Paul, but I can't bear to look at her anymore.
To look at that face that was once so beautiful.
Age... frightens me.
I'm vain, I know, but to look at Mother is to look into a mirror of what one day I must become.
No.
We are Durwards, remember?
Thoroughbreds.
The Durwards have always been renowned for their usefulness.
Mother is a Durward.
By marriage, not by birth.
What has happened to Mother will not happen to us, dear sister.
I promise you.
It will not happen to us.
You're rough with me.
So much bitterness.
So much. Why?
Why?
I once went off to fight a war.
I went off and left my mother and my little sister behind me.
The two people that I love most.
When I returned, my sweet little sister welcomed me with a kiss.
Yes, both of them.
Mother and sister, fallen to the scourge of vampirism.
I had to destroy them!
I had to bare their breasts, take a sharpened stake and drive it through their hearts.
Younger.
Oh, no.
Kronos!
Kronos!
Kronos!
What is it?
What's wrong?
My face. Look!
Look at my face.
Rope. Strong rope.
Well?
Hm... hard to say.
You see?
He's been bitten on the mouth.
For God's sake,
I survived a vampire's bite.
But he is not the man you are.
Marcus?
Marcus...
It was me, wasn't it?
That girl in the forest... it was I.
Oh...
Yes.
I'm doomed.
My soul in never-ending torment.
It's... I...
Oh, God.
Kill me!
Kill... kill me!
If the situation were reversed, you would implore him to do the same.
Kronos, this must be done.
We will not be killing him.
He is dead already.
But his death will bring life.
It will give us the knowledge we need to destroy this thing that has infected him.
For pity's sake, finish it!
Finish it!
Kill me!
So be it.
Well, come on!
A vampire only bleeds at the moment of its death.
Grost.
Myself...
...again.
But how did...?
The flame didn't touch him.
This is what killed him.
A simple cross.
Made of steel.
Then we have our answer.
Yes.
And Marcus...
...dear Marcus... is at peace at last.
Dr. Marcus was a good man, and a bad one killed him.
Aye.
It was that stranger that did it.
Him and that hunchback.
They killed Dr. Marcus.
Murdered him in cold blood.
We'll make it a life for a life.
Kronos!
Kronos.
A sword fit for a king.
Or a Kronos.
Oh, Barton.
You frightened the life out of me.
I couldn't sleep.
This damn storm.
Nor I.
Thought I'd warm a little milk.
We'll both be like death in the morning.
I keep thinking of Vanda... and Isabella.
Well, don't.
It's best that we don't.
Oh, I wish Father were home.
His reputation was formidable.
It is said that few saw his blade, but only felt it when it found its mark.
He never met his match.
Except in God.
He was kin to you?
He was my father.
Oh.
Forgive me, I did not know that I stood with my Lady Durward.
Kronos.
Captain Kronos, m'lady.
Sara?
M'lady.
Is it possible, Grost?
Marcus said he went up to see the Durwards.
But such a creature.
She is beautiful, young and fair and...
Exactly.
Well, we'll know one way or another soon enough.
Garlic flower.
You're sure you want to go through with this?
You'll be the bait, you know?
I know.
Excuse me.
Time to make our move, my friend.
Time to kill a vampire.
Mother?
If only you would drink this, you would feel stronger.
Where the devil is Barlow?
Thank you, sir.
Now, an explanation, I think.
What were you doing out there?
Getting more frightened every minute.
More and more lost.
I ran away, sir, from my father.
He would force me into marriage when it's another I love.
Please, if I could stay here just for tonight, sir.
I beg of you.
Of course, you may stay.
I'll prepare a room.
No. No, Your Ladyship.
I've already presumed too much on your kindness.
Nonsense... it'll take but a moment.
I can stay here... before the fire.
I'd prefer it.
Very well, then.
As you wish.
Good night to you, then.
Good night.
Good night, dear sister.
Sleep well.
Sara, what the devil's going on?
Paul... her face.
Her face!
Mother?
The bloom of youth... why should that appall you?
Is it wrong to be young and beautiful again?
You forget...
I'm a Costine by birth, and the Costines are blessed with many dark secrets.
It has taken me seven years... seven long years to bring them into play, to make me what I am now: never to grow old.
Isn't that as precious as life itself?
It is life itself.
And so life begins again.
Begins again for me and for your father.
Father is dead.
No.
Father is dead.
Dead of the plague.
No.
Never dead.
Just sleeping... as you shall see for yourself.
I awakened him, brought him back from the dead.
My husband... my lover... back into my arms.
But I see you do not understand.
Come here, my children.
Come here.
You will remember nothing of what has passed here.
Do you understand?
Later, you will awaken and remember nothing.
Come, my darling.
Her life will be yours.
Yours.
Her youth will pulse through your veins, my darling.
Replenishing... restoring...
Take her.
Take her!
My Lord Durward.
At your service, sir.
To the death.
So be it.
Yes, you bleed, my lord.
This is God's blade.
Forged for your black heart.
Die!
You can't hurt me, Kronos.
No.
You can't kill me.
Kronos!
Marcus.
Dear Marcus.
You must go now.
Go where?
Anywhere.
Everywhere.
Wherever there is evil to be fought.
But on lonely nights,
I shall think of you.
And I you.
Oh, Wakantanka,
Great Spirit of the Sun, source of all life, created in violence, pleasure and pain, which then takes life to sustain life, in the eternal cycle of life and death - l stand humble and obedient before you.
Make me worthy!
How many is that?
- Six, your Lordship.
- Maddock...?
- l'm sorry.
- John. Address me as John.
Yessir. lt won't happen again.
You slip at least once a day. How many weeks have l been telling you?
Yes, sir, John.
- Six, did you say?
- ln a row. That's good shooting, John.
- Thank you, Maddock.
- You may address me as Joe.
- Joe... What did you say that was?
- Prairie chicken.
Grouse.
Grouse. At home in England, l'd be shooting grouse. lt occurs to me, l've travelled halfway around the world at great expense, simply to kill a different kind of bird.
What's wrong with that, if you ain't got nothing better to do? l ain't Joe.
For five years l ain't got nothing better to do.
You must have picked up a lot of beans somewhere.
Not only beans, Joe, but family titles, family property, family position...
All picked up. All inherited.
Everything l ever wanted in life l've bought. lncluding you three. ln England l looked up to God and royalty and down upon everybody else.
What you been doin' for five years?
Looking, Joe. Just looking. ln 1 820 l committed the unpardonable sin of resigning my commission in the Guards. lt wasn't an earned commission. ln my family, it came with birth.
So here l am. Shooting birds.
Your Northwest Territory...it is beautiful.
Hey, Ed. l dumped the water out of that damned tub into his tent. All over his tent.
And look what l found.
- Rum. That spell rum, don't it?
- Yeah.
R - U - M.
Hey, Ed... Draw!
- Still drunk as coots.
- l'll have to talk to those two. ln a pinch, l've know them to drink coal oil.
Beat the drums and sound the brass, here come one big horse's ass.
- What were you two firing at?
- Nothing in particular.
That was an accident.
Even at this range, l'm inclined to believe you.
How long would it take to go to St Louis?
- A month, if that wagon holds up.
- We'll start in the morning. lf the wagon breaks down, abandon it and the team.
We'll travel by riding horses if necessary.
- ls them orders, John?
- Those are orders, Maddock.
Well, you've boozed us out of another job.
We ain't shutting down camp.
He guaranteed us four months wages.
You'll get your money.
The dude ain't cheap.
Yeah, and if he's short, his family can sell the castle. l've never seen such a fella.
He won't even chew tobacco.
That water's powerful cold, your Lordship.
Thank you, Maddock. l can assure you l've been bred to get used to it.
This ain't gonna be no bath.
He's going ice-skating.
- Listen, you rum-heads, that's enough.
- We was just warning him.
- Something must have spooked him.
- No, he's seen Morgan going by.
Oh, my God!
Christ! l've had enough.
You bunch of bloody bastards. l'm not a horse. l'm not an animal.
Wee-cha-shad, or whatever the bloody hell the name is.
Man! Man! l am a man!
American, eh?
American? Don't be absurd.
Anglais.
Me speak Anglais. Good Anglais.
Well, when you address me, would you kindly speak it?
Yes. l will speak it.
You lucky Chief like angry.
You yell. Make strong.
Lucky not kill. Yes, very lucky. l can hardly believe my good fortune.
- Who the blazes are you?
- Batise.
Prisoner. Five years.
Five!
You speak French in a most peculiar way. You're not French.
Sacrebleu, non. Papa Français.
Blue eyes, see.
Mother flat-head lndian. Pure. See.
Family all killed.
These lndians...these Sioux. l can well believe it.
Did you never try to escape?
Yes.
Cut leg. Oh, yes.
Zip! lf l try go again, zip-zip other leg.
After...crawl. Crawl.
But now me very clever fellow.
Play crazy, see? lndian don't kill crazy man.
Crazy man no hunt, no work.
Got spirit. Wakantanka.
- Good luck for village.
- So you gave up.
Me give up nothing. Nothing!
Me very clever fellow. But you...
...the great, important English man!
Yes, you go, yes.
Like fox - dodge hounds.
And you know what happens?
Mean bad lndians out there -
Shoshone, Blackfoot, Cherokee.
Cut off everything. Zip. Zip. Zip!
But you no man anymore anyhow.
You work horse for old woman.
Buffalo Cow Head.
Maybe she zip anyway.
Stallion no good for work horse.
Everybody be happy, except you...maybe. lt's rancid fat.
Don't you have any...dried meat?
Batise.
What's going on?
Black Eagle come for Yellow Hand sister. l thought she was one of his wives.
No, no. That one Running Deer.
She is sister.
Other one is wife, Thorn Rose.
Now, Black Eagle buy sister.
- Buy her?
- Yes. Marriage. lndian way.
Must buy wife.
Very important for Black Eagle.
He only chief number two. lf she have him, he be Yellow Hand brother.
Big trouble. Yellow Hand say no.
Work hard, eh? Water?
Yes... Now that the son is dead, she has no other man.
Nobody protect her. Nobody care.
Cut off finger. Scavenge.
Come winter...she die.
Like you. One time big, grand English.
Now horse.
Stop that idiotic giggling, you bloody fool, and listen to me. l've had enough of your nonsense.
Play your fool to them but not to me. l'm going to get out with your help.
And why l do this?
Because you want to get out, that's why.
These other lndians that you spoke of, we'll need a war party to get through them. l don't suppose these Sioux have any guns?
What they know about guns?
Never see guns.
Must fight close. More brave to touch enemy. They count coup.
You look? You like? l have a big idea - you marry Running Deer.
Then maybe Yellow Hand give you war party.
All that for you.
Grand white gentleman.
She say no to Black Eagle and give herself away to Horse.
Hey, but you got mane!
Not even old squaw kiss hair on face. l have a lot to learn, Batise... and you are going to teach me.
Give them to your mother.
For her, with my compliments. l didn't think that giving flowers was so humorous. l'm...l'm sorry.
Me make love to her? Good God, no!
What is this about her shoe?
What is she trying to tell me?
She say she have no hole in her moccasin.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- lt mean... lt mean she virgin.
- l have no reason to doubt it.
Virgin take any husband she want... but not you, Anglais.
Get away, you horrible old hag!
Shoshone!
They say you kill two Shoshone. ls true?
- And l took these horses!
- And scalps!
- Big chance...big chance.
- l can't hear you.
Horses! Scalps!
- Wife! Now, wife. Then warrior.
- Then soon...Chief!
The wife sounds grand right now.
Let's get straight to her.
And then war party. And then we go!
We go!
We go! We go!
No, no. Do not look mother in face.
Taboo. Or you be cinksi.
- Cinksi?
- Son. You be her son till she die.
Oh, that suits me perfectly.
Horse... Horses!
- Does that mean we're married?
- Not yet.
- What the hell's going on now?
- Say no scars...no vows.
- Scars? Vows?
- Yes, scars. And ''Vow to Sun''.
He say you make Vow to Sun.
Then vow you brother.
But l just bought her. l just bought her, didn't l?
What the hell did l do?
Marriage is good, but must be made sacred first.
Sun Vow. lf no pain, nothing good is born.
Even seed burst to make grass.
Now make vow for courage. l vow to prove my courage, to withstand all tests of pain.
You stand in sun all day, all night...
...until sun come again.
Then suffer much pain.
God watch you now.
Wakantanka watch.
Now you ready for Sun Vow in tepee Wakan - holy lodge.
Hope for courage.
Pray Wakantanka let you live.
- l will live, Batise.
- Yes. And after, we get war party.
And England we go.
England...
Wherever you go, l serve you. l serve you well?
Oui, Batise.
You have served me well.
- When do l kiss the bride?
- You prove you man in Sun Vow, and then she kiss.
She kiss plenty... in white tepee women make for you.
That one?
- She must make pure in sweat bath.
- Sweat bath?
Yes. lndian way.
She sweat, sing, pray, make pure.
Medicine Man pray to Wakantanka that no bad things come for you.
And then you have peace... and love.
Chief want me too. Need my tongue.
He speak about Shoshone.
Counted coup scalps. Big medicine.
Must show god you brave.
Must prove courage.
Now you say why you should be permitted to make Sun Vow.
Yellow Hand... when you first brought me here, you said l was a horse. An animal.
And to me you were...
All of you were mean, vicious, ignorant, superstitious,
- ugly, benighted savages.
- No, no!
Repeat it. Repeat it!
Repeat it...accurately!
To me, you are no different from men all over the world.
When your stomachs are full and you sleep the long night, you know you must hunt again for food.
And when you fight your enemies and their arrows pierce your skins, you bleed like all men.
But it seems to me that you only live to hunt your buffalo...
...to fight the Shoshone...
...and to have your women. l know you would say to me,
''What else is there?''
Yellow Hand say your word is good, but Medicine Man say word not good.
Now, tell them this: one day, l will be a chief.
One day l will be a chief!
Say what proof you brave?
Suffer pain, yes! Give up now! Out!
He said because you white, you weak.
You give up.
Shame before Wakantanka.
Medicine bag. Bones. Beads.
Good luck things. Great honour.
Jesus! l am Tatankaska.
Spirit animal. Buffalo White.
Speak the truth in humility to all people.
Only then can you be a true man and free of your chains. l want you. My hunger is real.
But freedom is what you mean to me.
When the chance comes, l shall go. l know. l know.
- Grouse...
- What did you say?
Grouse. lt's a small bird, Batise. l used to shoot it in England... a long time ago.
Batise! What's the matter with Yellow Hand?
Yellow Hand take bearskin belt.
He swear to Wakantanka never to retreat in battle.
He now want brave death to save his honour, because Black Eagle take Thorn Rose.
He was her first man. lndian law.
That means Black Eagle can take Yellow Hand's woman... when he wants her. lf Yellow Hand complains, he is weak.
Hey, Anglais... This may be good.
He die - you be made chief quicker.
Get war party. And we go.
Five years you've lived here and you've learned nothing about these people!
All his death is to you, is a means of escape.
Take her away from this.
Take her away from this!
You're making it very, very difficult for me, Little Freedom.
Very, very difficult.
Free... Free... Freedom?
Freedom.
You are Little Freedom.
Mother.
Little Freedom, now is the truth.
You are part of me.
When l go, you go.
Forever!
Dakota Lake, the mountains...
Peace River, south. Adirondack.
Medicine Man say buffalo go after winter.
Village move.
This place bad medicine now.
Move west. Away from home.
You'd better finish that map, Batise.
He say something is wrong.
Go and get your weapons.
Get the weapons.
Shoshone Chief take bear belt.
Get everyone to the Ceremonial Lodge.
And get them bows and arrows!
Line them up there, face the Shoshone.
Form two lines.
One in front and one back here.
First line to their knees.
Second line remain standing.
The first line fire only.
Fire!
Now we go. Anywhere.
Little Freedom.
John!
Cinksi!
Oh, my God. You've got nobody left to provide for you.
You'll give everything you have away.
You'll scavenge for offal.
With winter coming, you won't last a month.
Son. l will be your son.
Cinksi.
Goodbye, Little Freedom.
Deep in the heart of the Aegean Sea lies the island of Navarone.
In 1943, it stood poised like a knife in the Allied side.
Secretly designed giant radar-controlled guns...
...anchored in the bowels of the ancient rock...
...gave the German High Command total strategic control.
Frequent Allied air and sea attacks resulted in total failure.
In desperation, the Allies turned to a small band of commandos...
...led by Major Mallory and demolitions expert Corporal Miller .
They succeeded in penetrating the very heart of the gun complex...
...planted high explosives at the base of the giant shell hoists...
...and then escaped to await rescue by ships of the British navy.
- Reduce speed, number one.
- Aye, aye, sir. Down 50 revs.
Fire.
Fire.
Mallory, Miller, good to have you aboard.
We thought for a moment we'd left you on Navarone.
Move! Move!
Come on, move it!
Move it!
Move it, move it, move it!
Regulations state, sir, that in the absence of bacon, ham, et cetera...
...the acting catering officer, that's you, sir...
...shall authorize once per week, the issue of offal.
- Offal?
- Offal, sir...
-...is kidneys, liver, tongue, brains...
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Milly, how nice to see you.
- Hello, sir.
- Whatever are you doing here?
- I've no idea.
I'm reporting to Commander Jensen.
I gather you've been hurling yourself over the White Cliffs. How's the leg?
It's in the same place. I thought they pensioned you off for good.
You still peddling those whizbangs of yours?
Yes, we've got things that go boom for all occasions.
I'm working with a new detonator.
It's interesting--
Excuse me, sir. We can't keep
Commander Jensen waiting.
- We'll have a quiet pint later on.
- He'd like to see you too, sir, together.
Corporal, put that in my office, will you?
Mallory.
Take a pew. How's the leg?
- And Miller, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
Hear you've been attached to Winston's toy shop.
"Department of Dirty Tricks," as the Whitehall chaps call it.
Well, they speak very well of you.
We need you chaps for something rather special.
I'm afraid it's not exactly a masterpiece...
...but I wonder if you can identify this fellow.
Think back to Navarone.
I'd rather not, sir.
Nicolai?
Yes. Let you down a bit, didn't he?
But what about him?
Andreas' people had him shot as a traitor, didn't they?
Yes, so we were told.
In fact, he escaped.
He wasn't a traitor.
He was a German agent...
...who we believe is operating now in Yugoslavia with the Partisans...
...posing as one Captain Lescovar.
Now, you both knew Nicolai.
In fact, you're the only people we know of can make a positive identification.
So I'd like you to go out there and cope.
Cope, sir?
Kill him.
Discreetly, if possible.
But I'm a civilian now, sir.
Yes, we thought about that.
So you've been recalled to the current and promoted.
Staff sergeant.
Awfully generous, sir.
Exactly how do we get there?
We're tacking you onto Force 10.
The code name for an operation for the Allied mission in Yugoslavia.
Excuse me, sir.
What's their objective?
It's being treated on a need-to-know basis.
And you don't need to know.
Barnsby, come in.
- Sir?
- Colonel.
Force 10 flies out tonight.
Oh, that's all right.
Taking these boys with you.
I beg your pardon, sir?
It's a matter of transportation.
You've got passengers.
Just a sideshow.
This is Major Mallory, Sergeant Miller.
Lieutenant Colonel Barnsby.
Sir, my mission is all set. It's been planned down to the last detail.
The last thing we need are a couple of passengers.
Major Mallory does have a certain amount of experience.
I wouldn't doubt it.
We're talking about some hard traveling, sir.
We've gotta move fast. My men are young, in top physical shape.
- They're specially trained for this mission.
- I'm aware of that.
Sir, I am concerned about the safety of my command.
Now, these chaps have got a job to do as well.
And it's up to you to deliver them safely to the Partisans.
And you leave for Italy at 2300 hours...
...and you take off for Yugoslavia the following night.
Very well, sir.
Thank you. That's all, gentlemen.
Well, we'll do our best not to make a nuisance of ourselves, colonel.
Sure, you will.
Patch me on to the prime minister's office, please.
Prime Minister?
Force 10 has been activated, sir.
All right, enough!
- Thought we were going to an airfield.
- From what I've observed of Barnsby...
...we might be going to Yugoslavia by walking on water.
All right, it's right along here.
Slow down, Nolan.
Stop it.
Nolan, kill the lights. All right, out.
Oberstein, Reynolds, the fence.
Williams, Farrell, get this crap up to the fence. Come on, move it.
Gonna miss your plane unless you join us now, major.
Pleasant way with words, hasn't he?
Remarkable way of getting on an aircraft, don't you think so?
Oh, well, nothing's ever easy, is it?
It's not easy if you insist on climbing through fences in the dark...
...when there's a perfectly good gate half a mile up the road.
Anything we can do to help?
Yeah, you can keep quiet and out of the way, major.
What's with the fence, Oberstein?
Come on, move.
I don't have a lot of time for explanations.
One thing that you don't know...
...is the last three Allied missions into Yugoslavia...
...were blown right here in Italy.
So this time when we fly out, we're not advertising the fact to anybody.
Come on, you guys, shag your butts.
Hustle, hustle.
Holy Christ, will you look at those guys?
They're stealing half the field.
All right, hold it.
Wait for me.
Okay, men, let's go.
Blake, take care of Rastus there.
All right, fellas, freeze.
And you, back, back. Back off.
Bill, Eddie, get those other guys out of there.
Stay put, you two.
Okay, smart-ass.
- What's your name, kid?
- Walter.
Walter.
What's yours?
Well, it sure in the hell ain't Rastus.
Walter.
Come on, come on.
Come on, you got a stick, you got a stick.
Use it, use it, right now!
Good evening.
Major, move!
Let's get the hell out of here.
- You two guys officers?
- More or less, yes.
We're very much obliged to you, sergeant.
- Weaver.
- Oh, Sergeant Weaver. Thank you.
U .S. Army Medical Corps.
But, sir!
Still some outside, Reynolds.
Come on, shag it, get the lead out.
Come on, damn it.
Hey, sir!
Where's Nolan?
I think you can take it he won't be joining us.
Okay, let's go.
What the hell?
You son of a bitch!
I saved your asses back there...
...and you run out on me.
Hey, who is this guy?
Get out of here.
Don't push! Don't push me!
- Look, you--
- I think it's a bit late for that now.
Look, you just shouldn't have left me there. I saved you bums.
Well, we didn't think you'd like where we're going.
You let me worry about that, huh?
That guy's gonna melt into the landscape.
Well, you are one man short.
Well, Nolan can handle a chute, at least.
- Can you handle a chute?
- I can learn on the job.
That's right, you learn on the way down.
So sorry.
I was rather hoping we'd lost that.
You never know.
It might come in useful.
Hey, hey, what do you got in there?
My pajamas.
Looks like high-explosive pajamas to me.
Not to worry, old boy.
Been handling this since I blew up the nursery with my first chemistry set.
Poor old nanny.
Yugoslavia, dead ahead.
We got company.
Cut two!
Reynolds, bail out!
Jump!
Go!
Come on, move it!
Come on, get out!
Come on, move!
Come on!
Forward.
Forward.
Mallory.
Okay.
- Seen any of the others?
- Not yet. Get down.
Place is crawling with Krauts.
They're coming out of the woodwork.
Yes, aren't they?
Come on.
- Okay, Reynolds?
- Yeah.
- Where's your Sergeant Miller?
- Hanging about, I should think.
How the hell did he get here?
He shoved his way in.
You let him on the plane?
I think he more or less invited himself.
- Where did you learn to use a knife?
- Harvard University, man.
You don't call him "man." You call him "sir," and you call me "sir."
Your ass is mine. You do as you're told.
Is that understood, soldier?
Yes, sir.
We've gotta get out of here before that patrol comes back.
Lieutenant Reynolds, take point.
Sergeant Weaver, bring up the rear.
And everybody keep up.
All right, let's go.
Organized young gentleman, isn't he?
Of all the dumb-ass luck, an AWOL medic and two mystery guests...
...one with a bum leg.
- Any idea where we are, colonel?
- Not a hell of a lot, no.
If we keep going east, we'll end up where we're supposed to.
How did we get stuck with those two clowns?
I don't know, Doug.
Some idiot at British HQ.
Come along, gentlemen.
It's not teatime yet.
Do you think that young man has any idea where we are, Milly?
- No, I shouldn't think so.
- I shouldn't think so, either.
I'll go and try and find out.
Yes, why don't you do that?
Excuse me, colonel.
Do you have any idea where we are?
I've got a good idea where we are.
And how long it's gonna take to get there, if you two can't keep up.
All right, let's move it.
What lovely chaps.
- How do you suppose he hurt that leg?
- I don't give a shit as long as he keeps up.
- This is really beautiful country.
- Yes, marvelous.
Rather like the Scottish Highlands.
- Do you know Scotland?
- No.
Yes. I've often thought that I'd like...
...to settle down there someday.
Looks like you're gonna have to change your plans.
Colonel.
Take it easy.
Don't anybody do anything dumb.
Welcome.
Captain Drazak.
17th Partisan Regiment.
- Good morning, captain.
- Welcome, welcome!
Thank you, Captain Drazak.
They frightened you with bandages, huh?
Without bandages, you:
German, how you say:
You say "flamethrower."
Yeah, yeah, flamethrower.
Hello! Hello!
How do you do?
This is Maritza, good soldier comrade.
How do you do, good soldier comrade?
Hello, blackie.
Maybe it comes off now, Maritza.
Hold it.
Steady, all of you.
Back off, soldier.
I make big joke...
...but joke on me.
Good, blackie. Come, we go.
We eat with our comrades.
We make friends and drink.
Then we fight the Germans.
Come.
Come, we go.
Where did you learn to punch like that? Harvard?
No, Harlem. Colonel?
I'm not trying to get anybody killed, least of all me.
- But that big idiot back there started it.
- Just watch yourself, soldier.
- How's the leg today?
- It's much better, thank you.
Good, good . Well, it looks like things may work out after all, huh?
Well, perhaps Miller and I can still carry out our little sideshow.
Sorry about Force 10.
You're down to two men, aren't you?
Of course, I don't know what your mission was...
...but obviously it just isn't on now, is it, colonel?
Looks rather like your own youngster, doesn't he?
Do you really think so?
My friends, come.
Come, we eat.
We are Chetniks...
...not stinking Partisans.
We hunt Allied commandos like wild pigs!
We work with Germans.
They are our friends.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Major Schroeder, 11th Army Corps.
How do you do, major?
Delighted to meet you.
We thought these people were
Partisans.
Of all the luck, eh, Barnsby?
Sure.
Chetniks? Who would have believed that?
The other three Allied missions that fell into our hands...
...were not quite so happy about it as you appear to be.
I'm not surprised, sir.
But, you see, we're not commandos.
We're deserters.
Deserters?
Give them to me, major.
We kill them now.
You see, we were in a prison camp in Termoli.
We escaped.
Managed to steal a plane.
Flew here, RAF Lancaster.
Were attacked, hit, bailed out and landed in your territory, thank God.
Fascinating.
Tell me, why exactly did you desert?
Now, I'm glad you asked that.
Yes.
Well, I am afraid that is rather a long story.
Oh, please, you must not be afraid of boring me.
Have you ever heard of penicillin?
No.
No? Well, I'm not surprised. It's new.
It's a drug that prevents wounds from becoming infected.
It cures a whole range of infections...
...including some of the nastier social diseases.
It's become one of the most sought-after items on the black market.
Our friend here, Sergeant Weaver of the American Medical Corps...
...was our supplier.
You are saying you stole these drugs from the Army to sell to civilians?
Not just civilians, major.
We'd sell it back to the Army.
Any army.
I see.
Tell me, what has all this to do with that suitcase that you keep looking at?
Well, that suitcase is full of our penicillin.
Oh, indeed. Perhaps
I could see some of it?
Certainly, major.
Open it, Miller.
You can't do that here, you'd ruin the lot.
You know perfectly well that any contamination will destroy it.
It must be opened under laboratory conditions.
There's nearly half a million pounds' worth of stuff here.
I know all that, but the major is not interested in our penicillin.
He only wants to know the truth.
What's the use of a half a million pounds to you out here?
Yes, well, that's beside the point, sir, but I'm not going to open it.
Our story doesn't seem to convince you.
No, it does not.
That's up to you, but every word he's told you is true.
If you don't believe it, check with your intelligence.
They'll verify the entire story.
Oh, I shall certainly verify your story.
Every word of it.
Get in, scum!
Cute story, major, very cute.
Now, what happens when they open the suitcase?
I should think we'll all get shot.
Don't you, colonel?
Maritza...
...what do you think?
They're lying.
What does it matter, anyway?
Kill them.
Yeah, you are probably right.
Do you know what I was thinking?
After the war, $1 million.
You, a simple peasant girl from where?
I can never pronounce the name of the place you come from.
With so much money, we could...
They're lying.
Kill them.
Out! Out!
Out! Get out.
Forward march.
Halt.
What did I tell you?
Well, at least we got a good night's sleep.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Our intelligence confirms your escape from Italy.
You and you, follow me, please.
Your escape from Italy is one thing.
The rest of your story is something else.
I had time to sleep on it.
So this morning, you know what I did?
I opened the suitcase.
Maritza!
And what do you think I found?
Firewood.
What did you expect? We buried it before your Chetniks picked us up.
We're not stupid . It's the only thing we've got to bargain with.
That is what I thought you would say.
I think you're lying.
You know they're lying. Why don't you let Drazak get rid of them?
Gently, Maritza.
I don't believe your so-called penicillin exists, but it just might.
So I will let you go and dig it up for me.
And if we do, you'll shoot us and bury us in the same hole.
I shall certainly shoot you if you don't.
Well, gentlemen, the choice is yours.
How the hell did we get into this?
More importantly, how are we going to get out of it?
I'm sure you'll think of something, major.
Any brilliant ideas, major?
I was hoping you might make a contribution, colonel.
What I can't figure is how the firewood got in the case.
Neither can I.
Don't know where we're gonna find any spare penicillin here, do you?
What are we gonna do, keep walking until we reach the Adriatic?
I don't think the iron maiden will let us get that far.
Halt!
What did I tell you?
We are three miles past the spot where you were picked up.
Well, where is this wonderful treasure?
In your imagination?
No, ma'am, it's not in our imagination.
I think it's a bit further on, don't you?
Yes, it is. Well, I mean, it's not much further than this.
It's hard to tell, the whole country looks alike.
You will start digging within five minutes.
What if we haven't found it in five minutes?
Then you will be digging your graves.
Hey, colonel.
Wait a minute, now this looks familiar.
Isn't this our little hollow down here?
Yes, yes, I think it is.
I remember this knoll over here.
Ma'am, this is it.
I think this is it.
- This knoll over here?
- Right.
You see, comrade, we lined it up between them...
There you are!
- There's our pile of stones.
- Right.
There it is, right over there, comrade.
Gotta get them closer and we use the spades.
You take the two that are closest to you...
...and I'll take the other one and the broad.
I'm gonna get them closer now, okay?
Fritz. Fritz, come! It's here.
- Ready?
- All right.
You can get up now. They're dead.
I'm the one who puts firewood in people's cases...
...and hides their high explosives.
Don't sit there gawping.
Get out of here.
Keep moving in that direction.
Try to find Petrovitch's Partisans.
Now, go.
Excuse me, good comrade soldier...
...but exactly what story are you gonna tell Schroeder about all this?
You took us by surprise.
You got away.
Here, hit me.
Did you expect me to go back there with my hair combed?
Hit me.
Well, all right. I'm sorry.
Harder.
- Come on, colonel.
- She gonna be all right?
Don't worry about that one.
She's tough.
I hope that man Schroeder believes that girl's story.
If he doesn't believe her, he'd better think twice about calling her a liar.
What about Miller and Reynolds?
What about them, colonel?
Yes.
I suppose they...
Let's move it.
Do you have the feeling we're being followed?
About the last 10 minutes.
Next time you can play the corpse.
Yeah, you seem pretty good with that thing, though.
Could have been luck.
Where are we? What is this?
Partisan territory, I should think.
You better hope.
- Germans?
- Yes, or Drazak, I suppose.
Who are they?
Partisans, thank God.
Good morning.
- We've been looking for you people.
- Be quiet.
You will make your report to Major Petrovitch.
Hey, what the hell are they so ticked off at?
- I think we've run into bad company.
- Yeah?
Yes, the leader.
- What about him?
- Afraid I know him.
- Nicolai.
- Who the hell is Nicolai?
It's Nicolai Lescovar.
The man I was sent to kill.
Dam, if it's the one I think it is.
I know where we are.
So do I . Right in it.
Do you think he's recognized you?
Yes, I think so.
Where are we going?
What's going on?
What the hell is going on here?
Lieutenant Colonel Barnsby,
United States Rangers.
Major Mallory, sir.
You got away from the Germans.
How?
We escaped.
Captain Lescovar has his doubts about that.
If you escaped, why were the Germans not pursuing you?
We observed you for five miles before we picked you up.
You should've observed that we killed two Chetniks that were following us.
- The men with the bandaged faces.
- Exactly.
Hardly a cause for congratulation.
Those two men were Partisans.
Comrades of ours whom we had infiltrated into the Chetnik camp...
...so now all links with our agent there are broken, thanks to you.
I'm sorry.
The fact remains that we're Allied officers.
There's no reason we should be treated this way.
I'm here in command of Force 10.
I insist that we be allowed...
...to contact the Allied mission.
I'm sure London informed you.
I was informed of your mission.
Personally, I doubt if it was ever a practical one...
...but now that you are here without equipment, the question is academic.
And you, major, you came here as an observer, perhaps?
No, sir.
I was charged with a mission of my own.
It's confidential.
Confidential!
Sometimes I get the impression...
...that London looks on this theater of operations...
...as a convenient place for conducting what they call "war games."
- May I speak to you personally?
- You are speaking to me personally.
- I mean alone.
- No.
The People's Army does not conduct military business in secret.
Very well, sir.
I was sent here to identify a German agent, code name Nicolai.
We are reliably informed...
...that he has infiltrated the People's
Resistance Army, and is now known...
...as Captain Lescovar.
And having identified this man, what were your further orders?
I was to eliminate him, sir.
- Eliminate. Don't you mean kill?
- Yes, sir. I do mean kill.
Do you hear that, Lescovar?
The gentleman from London wants us to shoot you.
I'm sorry, major.
I must admit you are indeed partly right.
There was an agent named Nicolai...
...operating somewhere south of here and also calling himself Lescovar.
But he was identified many months ago. And eliminated.
The British were informed.
- But London were very specific, sir.
- Yes, they frequently are specific...
...and just as frequently wrong.
Lieutenant Marko, see that these gentlemen...
...give you a full report on their activities in the Chetnik camp.
A specific report.
Well, captain, I guess we owe you a bit of an apology, don't we?
Well, it happens. We all get badly briefed sometimes.
Wish we had been briefed about the men with the bandages.
Replaced them with a couple of your own, that's a good trick.
They were messengers to our agent at Schroeder's headquarters.
Is your agent small, dark, pretty...
...beautiful gray eyes and shoots from the hip?
You mean Maritza? Yes.
She took a big chance for us.
She isn't Petrovitch's daughter for nothing.
Gutsy broad, saved our asses.
We hold this end of the bridge.
Over there, the Germans prepare for the final attack.
We have been ordered to prevent them crossing at all costs.
What exactly do they have over there?
Three divisions, perhaps more.
We hold a brigade here.
Soon they will bring up tanks, then--
- Why haven't you blown the bridge?
- We have tried several times.
Each time we lost valuable men.
Major Petrovitch has decided it is impractical.
Well, he's wrong about that.
There's no bridge in the world that can't be blown.
That's what Force 10 was here to prove.
I told you before, you have no men, you have no equipment.
I can radio London for equipment.
Get me an airstrip operational.
Oh, call London, prepare an airstrip for a plane that may never arrive.
- Have you anything else to suggest?
- Yes.
Give me 20 men,
I can blow that bridge to hell.
You mean you can blow 20 of my men to hell, for nothing!
That bridge is indestructible.
Excuse me, sir, you don't need 20 men.
You need Miller.
- Miller?
- He's an expert with explosives, sir.
He's probably the best in England.
- This Miller is in England?
- No, sir.
- Prisoner in the Chetnik camp.
- Then he's already dead.
Not necessarily, major.
I refuse to mount a full-scale operation just to find out, colonel.
I need every single man
I've got here now.
Sir, we don't need to mount a full-scale operation.
Just give us two men.
We got company.
These officers are from headquarters.
They're here to interrogate you.
You reported five prisoners, major.
Two of them tried to escape.
They were shot.
Major Schroeder is in the armory, and I have told you before...
...this area is out of bounds to all of you people, except Captain Drazak.
Kindly remove yourselves immediately...
...and if you can read, which I doubt, take a look at standing orders.
There. You have made me burn the milk.
Sergeant, let it burn.
You see, my colleague does not believe you are deserters.
- The prisoners, sir.
- What prisoners?
I thought you said these men had been shot.
Right, gentlemen, shall we go?
No!
This is not correct.
Quick. Miller! Get out of sight.
Bring him. Open it.
- Go.
- Marko.
Partisan bitch!
Always so kind to the men with burns.
But they have no burns.
The three Germans with the prisoners that escaped...
...all shot in the back with machine pistols.
You killed them.
Good . Give me the hat.
Come on.
Open. Open up.
Open!
Open!
- What about Miller's suitcase?
- The girl. She'll know where it is.
Milly.
Thank you, major.
Of all the shitty times to run out of gas.
Weaver, don't stand there with your head up your ass. Let's get this truck moving.
She okay?
Well, we'll drive as carefully as we can.
Hey, you . I don't like the way you talk.
- You what?
- I don't like the way you talk to me.
This truck doesn't move till somebody tells me what's going on.
Now, look, you--
You big-time officers have shafted me twice.
You tried to dump me in Italy, ran out on me back there.
- You don't tell me what's going on.
- I don't believe this.
Excuse me, but is your trouble that you want to be part of the team?
I don't want to be a part of any lousy team.
I just want some equal consideration.
I don't think you'll get equal consideration...
...from those people back there.
Do you?
Nobody moves until somebody tells me what you're planning to do.
We're going to blow up a bridge.
- Is that a fact?
- That's the general idea, sergeant.
- That's why we came back for Miller.
- Yeah, Miller.
You didn't give a mother-hunch about me.
You came back for Miller, but you didn't come for me?
No, we didn't.
That's the first straight answer you've given me.
I think the major's got a point, colonel.
They do look kind of mean, don't they?
Don't stand there gaping like an idiot.
- Get in there and drive the truck!
- All right.
We'll have to do this another way.
Get away from the truck.
Wait for my signal.
Useful little insect, isn't he?
- Keep an eye on him, Marko.
- Miller, you are an incurable show-off.
Don't knock it, major. Don't knock it.
There it is.
Lescovar's confirmed my signals got through to London.
Do you like that chap?
- Who's that, Lescovar?
- Yeah.
I haven't thought anything about him.
- Knows his job, I suppose.
- Yes, he does, doesn't he?
All right, sergeant?
What do you think?
Pretty straightforward, isn't it?
Well, no, not exactly.
In fact, not by a long chalk.
I'd say you're flogging a dead horse there, old man.
- What are you trying to tell me?
- Want to take a look?
Are you kidding?
I know every inch of that bridge.
Oh, yeah?
In that case, you'll have noticed how it's built into the living rock.
And how those main pilings are not just ferroconcrete, but 20 feet thick.
That's not forgetting--
I told you, London's dropping the same stuff we had before.
Yes, I know what you're getting, but it's not gonna be enough.
- What do you mean, not enough?
- You might just bend it a little...
...burn the paint work here and there.
But nothing that would seriously inconvenience the Jerries, I thought.
Our experts have been studying that bridge, and they say it'll blow.
I don't know where you learned your job...
...but I'm talking about the best engineers in the business.
Yes. They're probably experts at building things...
...whereas I'm an expert at blowing them up.
Take it from me that one would need eight hours...
...to make a decent job of that bridge.
Eight hours?
Assuming, of course, the Jerries are kind enough to leave us in peace.
- And maybe provide a few working lights.
- Miller.
You've seen those searchlights, have you? Well, I--
- Miller.
- Sir.
I think you've made your technical point.
Many thanks, sir.
If I weren't absolutely sure of my facts,
I wouldn't be telling you this now.
And you do understand, sir,
I'm not exaggerating.
What would happen to the bridge if that central arch...
...was suddenly hit by several million tons of water?
- Water?
- Water?
I think we've been talking about the wrong target.
Remember that dam we passed up around the bend?
What kind of a dam? Where is it?
Two and a half miles up the river.
But, my dear chap, why didn't you say so before?
Oh, I could do a tremendous job on a dam, yes.
With a dam, you've got natural elements working for you.
It's like an enormous bath.
All you've got to do is pull the plug.
Thank you.
Come along, gentlemen.
As a technician, I thought you might be interested in that dam, Milly.
So the RAF drops the stuff and we blow the dam, right?
Right.
Is it anything like Boulder Dam?
Now, that baby's big, man.
How often have you used this as a dropping zone?
Never.
The Germans see to that.
We have to keep moving around.
Makes sense.
Think those two guys know anything about blowing a dam?
Oh, no, I shouldn't think they've got a clue.
But never mind, old Weaver...
...we sergeants will see them through as usual.
- Right.
- Hello.
Ought you to be out and about?
It's jolly cold.
Come on in, take a seat.
Thank you, but one thing
I cannot do just yet is sit down.
You're not staying for the fireworks?
Bags of panic and blue lights.
No. I've seen too many airdrops.
They don't compare to a nice, warm bed.
Would you believe it? Right on time.
Marko. Marko...
I don't believe it.
Poor bastards.
This was no accident.
We've been had.
We've lost our last chance.
Damn.
Oh, no.
There is no question.
We were betrayed.
Aren't we always with Allied missions?
Their security's a joke.
It doesn't matter.
We do our part, and what do we get?
Twenty lives lost.
- One of them--
- It's past.
Finished.
All that matters now is that the
Germans are marshaling their tanks.
They will cross the bridge at first light tomorrow...
...and there is nothing we can do to stop them.
And you four gentlemen have outstayed your usefulness.
You'll be escorted back to the Allied military mission.
Out of harm's way?
Sir...
...I could leave the Germans some very nasty surprises.
Thank you, sergeant.
I think we have had enough surprises.
Captain Lescovar, see that these gentlemen have an escort of two men.
If those chaps had just half the equipment of the Jerries...
...I could've made that dam look like a Swiss cheese.
It's absolutely sickening.
Do you think the Jerries will have that gear we need in their supply dump?
Of course they would.
Lashings of HE, land mines, detonators, everything.
It's an absolute certainty.
Your escort, colonel.
- I think you will find them reliable.
- Okay, thank you.
I think we're going to need rather more men than this, captain.
My sergeant thinks that the Germans have the necessary equipment...
...in their forward supply dump so that the colonel can blow the dam.
That means you'd have to get into the marshaling yards at Mostar.
None of you speak enough German.
You need me to help.
Thank you, captain.
- Hope all you guys can swim.
- Would it matter?
No.
- You know, I could get shot for this.
- Couldn't we all?
You look real beautiful, you know that?
Yes, it's all right for you.
You don't have to come with us.
We'll be back in exactly
35 minutes, right?
- Okay.
- That's if the shop's open, old boy.
Pity they didn't teach you German at that school of yours.
Instead of Latin?
Perish the thought, old boy.
These any use to you?
No, Tellermines is what we want.
They look like dirty gray-green dinner plates.
Maybe they just haven't got any.
They have.
I wonder what happened to Barnsby and his truck.
I've been asking myself the same question.
Well, we can't just stand here like ducks in thunder.
Over there. The railway wagon.
Get the stuff in there till he comes.
Barnsby should have been here by now. Where the hell is he?
Beautiful.
- They're just the job.
- Not now, Milly.
Well, I'd rather do it now than in some ditch.
- How long?
- Oh, about 10 minutes...
...given peace and quiet.
Can't anything be easy?
Hey, where in the hell have they gotten to?
You maniac.
What the hell are you doing here?
I'll go and have a look around, see if I can find them.
- There he is.
- Wait. I'll get him.
- That's Lescovar.
- Yeah.
- Where's Marko?
- I don't know...
...but 10-to-1 they're hiding in that boxcar.
Shithead.
Bloody hell.
What's up now?
Some great ape of a sergeant, he's sent Barnsby's truck away.
Oh, no.
Sergeant.
Be quiet. Listen to me.
There are two British commandos in that truck behind me.
Two British commandos?
Who the hell are you?
I'm Colonel Von Ingorslebon,
Special Field intelligence Group.
Stand still, idiot. Look natural.
There is a third, an American colonel...
...in the truck which you just sent away.
I want to take them all together.
- What's Lescovar doing?
- He's shooting him some kind of story.
Go and assemble a squad of armed men. Quickly and quietly.
And keep them out of sight.
Then report back to me. Understand?
Good old Lescovar.
Best line-shooter in the Balkans.
What the hell's going on, colonel?
Just shut up and stay out of sight.
Where the hell are you going?
All right, you guys, let's-- Oh, shit.
The sacks, get them up here quick.
- You picked a fine time to do this.
- Sling out my suitcase, will you?
You trying to screw up this operation?
We're behind schedule already.
- How did you get here?
- I've been through that already.
Help me get this stuff loaded and get it on the truck.
- Right, Miller?
- Right, all set.
Let's go. Easy.
Hold it.
It's that man again.
I'll take care of him. Close the door.
They are all yours, sergeant.
Bring the squad.
All clear?
Give them a moment to get out of sight.
That fool, Marko, must have given himself away.
I don't know how.
How in the hell are we gonna get back across the river?
I mean, where are we going?
Berlin, I shouldn't wonder.
Sarajevo.
That's where the train goes.
No stops.
I'm sorry about Marko.
It's a risk we all take.
He was a brave man and a good friend.
Do you think that big sergeant spotted him as a Partisan?
I can't buy that.
The sergeant wasn't that bright.
He saluted you, you're wearing a corporal's uniform.
That doesn't rate a salute in the German army.
Not in anybody's army.
Why do you think he saluted you, Lescovar?
Perhaps he recognized my natural superiority.
Yes, perhaps.
You say this train goes to Sarajevo, no stops?
Yeah.
But I noticed on the map that we pass within a half a mile of the dam.
Strange you didn't bother to mention that.
Now, what's all this about?
Some fool of a sergeant salutes me...
...and I forget to mention that we pass near the dam.
And a little while ago, you said that
Marko must have given himself away.
I don't think he gave anything away...
...except his life.
What did you give away, Lescovar?
You think I'm a traitor, is that it?
I don't think, I know.
I've always known.
I just couldn't prove it.
You're Nicolai.
You're the man who blew us in Greece.
Thank you, colonel.
I've done your job.
You help me do mine.
Come on, you guys, move.
Once the Germans cross that bridge, they'll cut this country in half.
- There it is.
- Oh, crikey.
It's lit like a Christmas tree.
Doesn't matter. We gotta blow it.
Dawn's around 5:30.
If we don't blow it, the Yugoslavs will be dog meat.
What you need, sir, is a little diversion, isn't it?
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Oh, I don't know.
Try and imagine you're a dog.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
On the road, man, on the road.
I thought you were supposed to pick up dog shit, not spread it around.
Hallelujah!
That's some heavy-duty dog doo.
Just unroll it and string it out.
Shit, what's this, another one of his toys?
Damn, ain't that something?
Dog turd, snakes.
Come on, blackie.
Come on, blackie.
Come on.
Hey, you bleed red blood, eh, blackie?
- Careful. Watch your step.
- Don't worry, just keep moving.
One slip and we'll both go down.
This way. Over here.
Here.
Right here.
There we are. You all right, old man?
Once those panzers cross that bridge...
...they'll go through this country like a dose of salts.
Come on, blow, damn it! Blow!
Give them a chance.
They'll be here in a minute.
If they'd been caught, we'd have heard the alarm go off.
Almost finished.
How long do we make the fuse?
They're Germans, they're gonna be punctual.
Usually are.
We've run out of time.
Twenty seconds?
What do you say?
It's your decision, colonel.
I'm asking you.
Twenty seconds sounds about right, then we won't have so far to run.
It would have been nice to see that bridge go, huh?
Yes, wouldn't it?
All been very interesting, though, hasn't it?
Yes.
It didn't do a goddamn thing. Nothing!
Miller! That useless git!
- It didn't...
- What?
- It didn't work!
- I know it didn't work!
- Well, let's get out of here!
- Yeah, let's get out of here.
When I catch that little perisher,
I'll wring his useless neck!
Nothing!
We've been through all this, and nothing.
Nothing but:
You can't expect an enormous volcano with three tiny bags of explosives.
You have to let nature take her course.
Give it time, it'll work.
Hold it.
If I were you, I'd get out of here fast!
Faster.
- You son of a bitch!
- I told you, it's only a matter of waiting.
You cute little son of a bitch!
You did it! Come here.
You did it! You did it!
You cute little son of a-- You did it!
Why, you limey genius, I love you!
Steady on, old Weaver, steady on.
You did it!
Miller, you horrible little man...
...you knew that was gonna be a slow-motion explosion.
You deliberately didn't tell me, did you?
I didn't want to bore you with technical detail.
I thought it might be a bit over your head.
What happened to you?
He bit me in all the excitement.
But damn it to hell, we did it, colonel, we did it!
Yes, we did, sergeant. We did.
And a merry Christmas.
Yes, gentlemen, we did it.
But before...
...we can start awarding ourselves
Victoria Crosses...
...and Congressional Medals of Honor and so on...
...and so forth and such like...
...I think I'd better point out that, one:
We're on the wrong side of the river.
That two: We have no hope whatsoever of rejoining the Partisans.
And that three:
This neck of the woods will soon be crawling with bad-tempered Germans.
And four:
I don't think that our little genius,
Sergeant Miller there...
...has even got a box of matches left in his suitcase.
And so, therefore,
I think we can take it, gentlemen...
...that we are going to have a very long walk home.

Your comments, please.
Are these your works?
Yes. They don't look like much.
Very good.
Would you like a portrait?
Very well.
Please have a seat.
Your name, sir?
Ouyang Nin.
Mr. Ouyang.
You've traveled far, sir.
How do you know?
I know almost everyone around here.
I've just arrived.
Have you lived here all your life?
Yes.
Could you lift your hat a little?
Could you turn your head slightly?
May I know your name?
Ku Shen-Chai.
Scholar, at work already?
Would you like some tea?
You're busy now.
Maybe later.
Later, then.
Mr. Ku,
- who is he?
- He's an herbalist.
- Name?
- Lu. Something wrong?
Is he from here?
No. He's been here only for about a month.
He has a stand near the temple.
Why?
Nothing.
Mr. Ouyang!
I'll come back tomorrow.
Jun Yan General's Mansion
Be careful.
Mother! Mr. Shih!
You're back!
Come on in.
No. Maybe next time.
Take care, then.
Mother, is that house occupied now?
Who dares to live in that haunted place?
Mr. Shih read me your fortune today.
Guess what he said?
I can't.
Let's eat, then!
He said your lucky star will be active this year.
How does he know?
He read your palms and forehead, remember?
He said you should take the government exam this year.
- I am not going.
- Why not?
Why should I heed the advice of a blind man?
Every mother wants her son to succeed.
But you!
You're always so poor!
We may not be rich, Mother, but we have enough to live on.
After I've saved enough,
I might open a school some day.
That's ridiculous!
You want to be a teacher?
"A man's highest honor is to be an official."
It should be "to be a scholar"!
Why study not to be an official?
I study for the knowledge.
But you don't seem to know anything!
You're over thirty, and still can't find a wife. Why?
I'm waiting for my destined one.
She won't come if you don't have money!
Looks like I'll never live to see my grandchildren.
"In chaos time like this,
"it is better to be cautious."
You should be reciting your proverbs at the exam!
You are good for nothing!
Mother?!
What are you doing here?
I... I just want to see if anyone's in there.
Come home with me, now.
Come on!
Move!
Running around at this hour.
Look at you!
Your face is all dirty!
Mr. Ku,
I would like to ask you something.
Please do.
There is a Ching Lu Fort in this area, right?
That's right.
Have you been there?
I live there.
I heard that the place is haunted.
It depends on whether you believe in ghosts or not.
I will mount the portrait later,
Mr. Ouyang.
It will be ready for you tomorrow.
Thanks.
As for ghosts, I believe in them, so they exist.
But Confucius never mentioned them.
I am afraid I cannot agree with your views, Mr. Ku.
Until tomorrow.
"I believe in them, so they exist"?
Spells to ward off ghosts
Mother?
What are you doing here?
I... I...
You're always acting like a madman!
Allow me to introduce.
This is Miss Yang.
And this?
This is my son!
Let's go!
Miss Yang.
If you need anything, you may get it at my house.
Just help yourself.
Mother, who is she?
Our new neighbor.
You scared the living daylights out of her last night!
She gave me a good scare, too.
She lives here all by herself?
She must be brave.
Because it's free.
That's why WE stay here.
Shen-Chai!
What were you doing here, Mother?
I gave her some needles and thread.
They're poor.
They have nothing.
Mother?
Who else is living with her?
Just her mother.
She's almost ninety and bedridden.
Hey. What's that sword for?
Oh... nothing, nothing.
Then how do they make a living, Mother?
Miss Yang does odd jobs here and there.
Can you imagine how little money she makes?
- You're already over thirty...
- Not the exam again!
Don't interrupt!
Miss Yang is past 20 and single.
You should marry her!
You two are a perfect match!
She has no other friends, and you're a lonely nut!
That's it, then!
But... Mother...
What?
Will she agree?
Why not?
Are we not good enough for her?
It's all up to you.
Even if I say yes, she may say no.
Her family is dirt poor.
Why wouldn't she agree?
Tomorrow, I'll go and talk to her mother.
Come home early so we can hear her decision.
Mother.
You scared me!
Why are you still here?
Well?
No!
- Where are you going now?
- To the studio.
Looks like it's going to rain.
Just come home.
What did her mother say?
Her mother wants her daughter to marry.
But, Miss Yang said no.
Why?
She said she can't tell me why.
I say it's because we're poor and you're not an official!
Not that again!
You better take the exam this year!
Mother, haven't we talked about this already?
She wouldn't have turned us down today if you had a post by now!
You'll never marry if you keep on like this!
Mother...
Forgive me.
I knocked, but no one answered, and the door was open.
My apologies.
This is Mr. Ouyang.
This is my mother.
Please have a seat.
Sorry about the mess.
- You have quite a large place.
- You're too kind.
And quiet, too.
Mr. Ku. Are you off today?
Something came up...
I went to your studio this morning.
I am sorry.
Here is your portrait.
Please feel free to give comments.
This is wonderful.
I'm glad.
Your talent is too big for such a small town, Mr. Ku.
I am a simple man.
I can't ask for more.
Is Mr. Ku planning to take this year's government exam?
Do you think he should?
I'm sure Mr. Ku is more than capable of passing the test.
See? Did you hear that?
Then take it this year!
If you wish to try, then I may be of some service to you.
That's too much trouble!
How wonderful it is to have a savior like you!
I can help you.
I am very grateful, but I don't plan to take it this year.
Don't mind him.
We're much obliged to you.
- Mother...
- You just keep quiet!
Why not think it over, Mr. Ku?
This is for the portrait.
Thank you again.
It's not perfect, sir.
Please accept it as a gift.
Besides, this is too much.
I only charge 5 taels for a portrait.
Stop this!
Mr. Ouyang is a good man, so just take what he offers.
Good-bye for now, Mrs. Ku.
I'll come visit you later.
Sir, would you like to have your name on the portrait?
Excellent idea.
I'll come to your studio tomorrow and pick it up.
Please come back again, sir.
This Mr. Ouyang is a nice man.
You should get to know him better.
Wait!
Who are you?
General Shih.
Who are you?
Help!
- It's the fortune-teller!
- Mr. Shih!
Are you all right?
I am all right.
Where is my stick?
Forget the stick!
Let's get away from the rain.
My stick... where is my stick?
Your head is bleeding.
I'll go fetch a doctor.
My stick...
Miss Yang.
Please take a look.
Please go and get some firewood.
Has Ouyang found out who you are?
No, but who is that?
Go and tell Lu tomorrow.
Doctor Lu Meng's clinic
You've caught a cold, Mrs. Ku.
But it's not serious.
I must've got it from helping the blind fortune-teller yesterday.
I was drenched by the rain, and I began to shiver afterwards.
By then, I knew something was wrong.
Mother, you'll be fine after taking Doctor Lu's herbs.
What do you know?
Mrs. Ku, boil these herbs with water and drink for two days.
You'll get better soon, don't worry.
About your fee...
We'll settle that later.
We can pay later.
Doctor Lu is our good friend. Right?
Mother, you should rest a bit at the studio...
No need!
We're going home!
Good-bye.
Miss Yang!
Don't you recognize me?
Stay right there!
I need to ask you something.
Do you know a blind fortune-teller?
Should we rest a bit?
Rest? We're already home!
You're too kind, Miss Yang.
What happened to your face?
Are you feeling better?
I'm really getting old.
Look at all these herbs!
Miss Yang.
Please go home if you're getting tired.
That fortune-teller, Shih...
Do you know him?
No.
This must be hard on you, Miss Yang.
You've hardly slept.
You must be tired.
If only I had a daughter-in-law like you.
I know. We are poor...
We are much poorer than you.
I can't blame you.
You'll suffer more if you're with us.
Try to get some sleep, Mrs. Ku.
Shen-Chai has no ambition.
He won't take the government exam.
He must have his reasons.
He's as stubborn as my late husband!
He studied books for years, yet he wouldn't take the exam.
And he's getting old...
You're lucky to have such a filial son.
So what if he's filial?
He can't even get a wife.
With his talent,
I'm sure he'll marry a good lady.
Good or not, all I want is for him to get married.
He's over thirty, and my health is not what it was.
The day I die will be the end of our Ku family heritage.
Doctor Lu, how much do I owe you?
- We can settle that later!
- No, no.
Then you can just pay me
21/2 taels for the herbs.
- Is your mother getting better?
- Much better. Thank you.
I've been seeing lots of East Chamber agents here lately.
Their second-in-Command,
Wu Mun-Ta, is coming here.
Talk to you later.
Doctor Lu, do you know someone by the name of Ouyang Nin?
Ouyang Nin?
I don't.
See you, then.
Doctor, why is he...
Ku Shen-Chai is not an ordinary man
Mr. Ku, please come to my place tonight.
A jug of wine amidst the flowers
I drink alone
Raising the cup, I invite the moon
With my shadow, it makes three of us
Yet the moon does not drink
And my shadow merely follows my body
Briefly, the three of us congregate together
Drink, and be merry in springtime
The moon spins with my song
And my shadow mimics my dance
Let us savor this moment while it lasts
We will part after we have drank our fill
Let us cherish our friendship
Until we meet again, if ever
Mr. Ku.
Mr. Ku!
You have quite a lady's luck, coming here for a rendez-vous.
Come back with me, Miss Yang.
Mr. Ouyang...
Stay back!
You're from a good family, Miss Yang.
Shame on you!
Mr. Ku, what happened to your head?
I tripped and fell.
Mr. Ku!
Officers...
The magistrate requests your presence!
What for?
You'll find out when you get there.
- Sir...
- Come on!
Mr. Ku!
Please draw ten copies of this.
Let me know the fee and I'll pay you.
Thanks for bringing him.
Please, sit down.
Death warrant for fugitive
Yang Hui-Ching
This...
What is this all about?
It's stated there clearly.
Her father was a high-ranking official of the Tung Lin Sect.
He offended Eunuch Wei, so his whole family was sentenced to death.
We heard that his daughter had escaped with another man, but...
Why? You've seen her?
No, I haven't... but she's the daughter of an honest official.
What's this to you?
Just do the drawing!
Why must they kill her, too?
Small magistrates like us can do nothing about it.
Just draw, Mr. Ku.
Magistrate!
Magistrate, an East Chamber officer is here with some men.
What?
Prepare to receive him now!
Open the gate!
Magistrate, what about Mr. Tai?
I'll handle him. Go!
They're coming.
Greetings, sir.
You're too kind.
Magistrate,
I must say that your district is quite an exciting place.
- Please forgive us.
- That's beyond my authority.
You've been harboring several criminals here.
- The penalty will not be light.
- It's all my fault!
What do you plan to do?
Sir, we have just received the warrant for Yang Hui-Ching.
We will post them up tomorrow at crucial corners, and I will assign more constables to pursue her.
Nonsense!
With your constables, do you think you can catch Yang?
I will increase the reward listed on the posters.
No posters!
They will alert her, and she will flee from here.
But the Board of Punishment...
That will be my concern!
Yes.
Let me tell you.
His Lordship will arrive here soon, so watch yourself.
Please advise me what to do, sir.
Destroy the posters and bring your most capable men to await my instructions.
No need to draw anymore.
Just go home.
Mother, you've got to leave right away.
- What happened to your face?
- Let's go!
Come on.
Just go!
- What about you?
- I'll be fine.
- Be careful.
- Go!
Just go!
Miss Yang!
Miss Yang!
Mr. Ku.
Mr. Shih.
Mr. Ku, what brings you here?
Have you seen Miss Yang, the lady who lives here?
I am blind.
Forgive me.
Miss Yang and her mother are gone.
She tells you to leave, or your life is in danger!
- Do you know where she has gone?
- I don't know!
But I must find her!
Mr. Shih...
Mr. Shih, who are you, really?
I am certainly not blind.
Those people outside...
Silence!
Keep still.
Run!
General Shih, please come out!
He knows who you are?
Mr. Ku, do not get involved with these bandits.
They are all criminals on the run.
Run!
Go, now!
Miss Yang...
Why are you still here, miss?
I have unfinished business.
But both the local magistrate and the East Chamber are after you.
What do you plan to do?
I can't just be a sitting duck.
You plan to fight to the end?
You'd better leave, sir.
I can't just leave and not help you, miss.
Why not?
We're almost husband and wife, we're both in this together.
You and I are destined no more.
Don't mention it again.
Even if we're only friends,
I still would like to help you.
I'm afraid you, sir... are not the "duel to the death" type.
"Only the mindless will fight to the death.
"Might without wit will not achieve a thing."
Then do you have better ideas?
They outnumber us, so we must use strategy, not force.
If you trust me,
I'd like to offer my service.
Now that my life is in peril, how can I afford not to trust you?
Good!
Then...
I just don't want to get you involved.
Never mind that.
But, please, do tell me the whole story.
"All battles will be won if we know everything about us and them."
General Lu!
No need to argue with those villainous rats.
A few days ago,
I sent a memorandum to His Majesty.
It embodied your findings of the wrongdoings by Eunuch Wei and his East Chamber underlings.
Here are the copies.
Take them to the Tung Lin colleagues.
I fear that your memorandum will not reach His Majesty.
Then I shall tell him in person.
There will be trouble if
Eunuch Wei gets his hands on it.
Whatever happens,
I'll deal with these people to the end.
Sir.
Sir, an Imperial Messenger from the East Chamber is here.
Prepare to receive the decree.
Yes.
The decree of His Majesty.
Kneel to receive
His Majesty's decree.
Longevity to His Majesty.
By the order of the Emperor,
His Majesty summons Yang Lin for an immediate audience.
Long live the Emperor.
I heard that, in the memorandum that you sent to His Majesty, my name was mentioned.
Yes.
Also, there were accusations against Eunuch Wei.
They were not accusations.
They were facts.
You are an outspoken man.
You secretly conspired with Hung to embezzle 2 million taels.
Is there some truth to that?
That is nonsense!
No one in this world will believe that I, Yang Lin, am a corrupt man!
So you will not confess?
You tricked me here by deception.
I want to see His Majesty!
Torture him.
My father was eventually tortured to death.
General Shih and General Lu helped me to escape from the capital.
You mean Mr. Shih and Doctor Lu?
But Eunuch Wei did not stop at that.
His East Chamber spies scouted the country for me, so the two generals took me to the northern frontier.
Run!
Go!
That way!
Go!
There is nothing to worry about.
They wouldn't dare to cause trouble here.
Did you see three people pass by here?
I am talking to you!
What happened over there?
A moment ago, your men tried to resort to violence.
Thanks to my intervention, those people escaped from big trouble.
You are a monk.
You should just stay at your monastery and stay out of worldly affairs.
There are no killings in Buddha's sacred grounds.
Abbot, there'll be serious consequences for letting them go.
You must have had a tiring journey.
Please come and rest at our temple.
Please.
Please come with us.
I stayed at the temple for two years.
Abbot Hui Yuan taught me martial arts.
In a world so big I never thought
I would not find refuge one day.
It would be better if
Abbot Hui Yuan would help you now.
He wouldn't.
What about the magistrate?
He's on our side.
They are saying that Mun-Ta himself will soon be here.
He may be here on business, but he's actually coming after you.
What do you plan to do?
I plan to ambush them when they least expect it.
No. You should wear them down.
But how?
Here's the layout of Ching Lu Fort.
Make use of it, for it is here that we have an advantage.
You should stay here and wait for them to fall into the trap.
I've studied military tactics and strategies thoroughly.
As long as you can lure them here, then I can make them fall into your hands.
Lu Chiang! What is it?
Ouyang Nin left for Green Bamboo Hill this morning.
Looks like Ouyang Nin is on the retreat.
No.
I think Mun-Ta is sending his men here first.
We must not let Ouyang Nin have contact with them.
Wait!
These two are Mun-Ta's personal guards.
- They're dangerous.
- Let's take them one at a time.
Let's go!
Captain!
- Captain!
- Get away from me!
Captain.
- Magistrate.
- Yes!
Prepare pen and ink for me to write a letter.
Yes.
- You will write.
- Yes.
"To East Chamber's Commander,
His Excellency Mun-Ta.
"Tung Lin's remaining thieves are still at large here.
"Halt your advance for now.
"Signed, Ouyang Nin."
Send it to Commander Mun-Ta at once.
You have to hurry.
He must have left the capital by now.
If there is any delay,
I will take your head!
Who's there?
No one.
Let no one in here.
Yes. I've already instructed the guards.
Good.
Captain, your wounds...
I've taken some medicine.
I must remain seated here.
Tell them not to make any noise!
- Dr Lu.
- Magistrate.
This man is badly wounded.
Who's there?
Captain, you're badly hurt.
I've found you a doctor.
Haven't I told you?
Let no one in here!
It's... it's you!
Captain Ouyang.
Lu Ting-yen, you've come here just in time.
I'm here to treat your wounds, Captain.
We must lure Mun-Ta here.
Let's write him a letter.
A letter for His Excellency.
- Wait here.
- Yes.
What is it?
Your Excellency, a letter from Ouyang Nin.
What did he say?
Your Excellency, everything has been prepared.
We await your arrival.
Signed, Ouyang Nin.
He said everything is prepared.
Good. Let's go on our way.
Forward!
I heard that Mun-Ta will stay at Ching Lu Fort.
For how long?
Until he finds Ouyang Nin.
How many troops did he bring?
About two hundred.
"The enemy is many, and we are few."
Use superstition.
I don't understand.
First, spread the rumor that Ching Lu Fort is haunted.
But isn't that a bit...
Just do it.
My mother can help in this.
Your Excellency.
Have you found Ouyang Nin?
Not yet.
Have you been to that General's Mansion?
Well?
Your Excellency, I've heard that the place is in shambles.
It's been deserted since the wars.
Then go and clean it up.
But Your Excellency... that place is supposedly not "clean."
What do you mean, it's not clean?
It is rumored that ghosts haunt the place.
Everything's hearsay.
Stop listening to nonsense!
You'll go there tomorrow.
Yes.
Jun Yuan General's Mansion
Post some guards out here.
You four, stand guard here.
Let's go.
Stay right there!
Halt! Halt!
What?
Look over there!
Let's go.
Well?
What are you doing here?
Ghosts!!!
Ghosts!!!
Sir! There are ghosts outside the gate!
Is that so?
I saw them with my own eyes,
Your Excellency.
I've heard of ghosts, but I've never seen them.
I'd like to see them myself.
Your Excellency, your responsibilities to protect the frontier are too important for you to risk your life.
Those ghosts won't come and get me.
Never heard the proverb
"Demons fear evil men"?
Then...
Pay no attention.
Some villagers are probably trying to cause trouble by spreading rumors.
But our soldiers... they all believe it.
I think this must be the work of criminals.
Magistrate, what do you say?
Yes.
Your Excellency is indeed wise.
He doesn't believe it?
It seems like he's suspecting our magistrate.
I say we should not waste time.
Let's just sneak up on them at night and ambush them.
That would ruin everything.
I think we should invite them here the night after next.
Brother Shih, let's deliver a present to Mun-Ta tomorrow.
Ouyang Nin!
- Magistrate.
- Yes.
Where did you find his body?
Near Ching Lu Fort.
Ouyang Nin died in your district and was obviously murdered.
What do you say?
It's all my fault.
Very well.
Guards!
Take him away and await further punishment.
Your Excellency!
I have a secret message to report.
Speak.
As it is confidential, could they...
Speak.
Yang Hui-Ching?
Is she Yang Lin's daughter?
Yes, and she's with two renegade generals.
Splendid.
All three are here.
Who else is with them?
I heard they are recruiting bandits to kidnap Your Excellency.
We must strike first, Commander.
Tonight, I'll lead the troops there and kill them all.
Your Excellency, now is the time.
Help!
Hold still.
What is it?
- It's true, sir. There are...
- Rebels?
Ghosts!
The two of them are dead!
Just like what the villagers had said,
Your Excellency.
Nonsense!
Beware of an ambush.
What is it?
Look!
Your Excellency!
We should...
Tell them to calm down!
Silence!
Sir, perhaps you should confer with His Excellency.
Men cannot fight against ghosts!
I say we should come back here in daytime.
Besides, we've killed so much.
Our aura of death is too strong.
Your Excellency, I think...
You're usually the intelligent one.
Can't you see this is a plot by the villains?
However, I'm afraid we might have invoked the wrath of the gods.
How can a high official like you believe in such ghost nonsense?
I've consulted with some of my officers...
What is this?
A mutiny?
Don't let her go.
Shih Wen-Chiao?
- Your Excellency...
- They must be inside!
Look out!
Your Excellency.
I'll stay here.
You two go in and search around.
Miss Yang!
Please spare my life.
Your leniency will only impair our scheme of things.
The funeral tablet of Yang Lin
Miss Yang!
Dr. Lu!
Miss Yang!
Miss Yang!
Have you seen Miss Yang?
Miss Yang.
Where is she?
Abbot... have you seen Miss Yang?
Have you seen Miss Yang?
Mother.
Have you seen Miss Yang?
Yes.
Where is she?
She asked you not to look for her.
I must find her!
I have entered the monastery.
The Ku family's posterity is ensured.
Yang Hui-Ching, you still have unfinished business.
Come back when you are ready to return to Buddha.
Ku Shen-Chai's life is now in danger.
Go with General Shih to help him.
Wanted Ku Shen-Chai
He's over there.
It's him! Get him!
Go now!
Let's go!
He's the Commander-in-chief.
General Shih. Miss Yang.
I am Hsu Hsien-Chun, Chief Commander of East Chamber Guards.
Greetings to you, General.
Likewise.
I have orders from His Excellency Wei to invite you to the Capital for consultations.
Please tell Eunuch Wei that Miss Yang and I are now in seclusion.
We will not return to meet him.
We could also invite you back to close the case.
We have to decline even more strongly.
Good.
Then I can do no more for you.
I advise the two of you to think it over carefully.
You take the fat one.
Stay back!
Commander Hsu.
Can you perchance be Abbot Hui Yuan?
I am.
Abbot, you are highly revered.
Why would you harm your reputation by harboring fugitives?
Are you not afraid of tarnishing your holiness?
Perhaps I still retain a trace of my earthiness.
General Shih here once held high office, and Miss Yang is of noble heritage.
They lost all hope because they're being persecuted by villains.
That's why they sought refuge and solitude away from this world.
Nevertheless, East Chamber agents refuse to stop pursuing them.
Their duty calls for it.
Then forgive me for not knowing much about the Tung Lin Sect case, but please let them go in peace for Buddha's sake, if not mine.
I am a diligent man, and His Majesty's laws are not for me to alter.
Then tell Eunuch Wei that the two of them are now with Buddha and will never leave this mountain.
That is my decision.
Nonsense!
How could a monk like you criticize the imperial rules?
Hsu, you are just a petty henchman for the eunuchs.
The peace of Buddha's land is not for you to disturb! Leave now.
I will arrest you for harboring criminals.
Get this evil creature out of my sight!
Put down your weapons.
Stay back!
Now go.
Don't come near!
- Abbot!
- He still has evil in him.
General Shih!
Please accept me, Abbot.
You are not yet free of worldly ties.
Abbot. I have done too much killing in my life.
At night, phantoms haunt me in my dreams.
Sometimes I hallucinate and sometimes I agonize in pain.
I wake up in a cold sweat.
All I wish is to live my remaining life in simple solitude.
Good.
"Put down the sword and attain peace with Buddha."
It is good that you recognize penitence.
If you don't accept me, Abbot,
I shall kneel here for eternity.
"The sea of suffering is boundless.
Turn back to the shore."
Arise.
Brother!
Father!
THE END
THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN
Good luck, General Yin.
A man must do or die
Mr. Ho, before I left,
Lord Cheng is concerned about you.
If he can strike back with his army and defeat the tartars, - credit for Canton will be yours
One must sacrifice for one's country
The 6 brothers arrested by tartars
Were tortured but have so far, - but refused to make a confession.
This is most admirable
If I failed,
I wouldn't even get arrested.
General Yin.
- Mr. Ho, please.
Sirs
When Inspector-general.
And General Tien Ta arrive, - please say a good word for me.
Don't worry, Mr. Magistrate.
General Tien Ta ordered us to capture the 6 traitors
The Inspector Will supervise the execution
Yes, yes...
Tang San-yao, it's almost 12:30 p.m.
Don't forget the General's command
The Inspector-general is here!
Make way...
We're trapped!
General Yin, I knew you'd be here to "welcome" the Inspector-general.
But he has not yet reached Canton!
Stop!
Your skill is comparable to a general.
Let's have a fair fight:
A General to a General.
Let me try you out
Good, I need a substitute.
Let me fight you single-handedly
Quiet down!
The teacher's here...
The teacher's here, hurry up...
Mr. Ho
Mr. Ho
Please have tea, Mr. Ho.
Mr. Ho, why are you so late?
Did you go to see the execution?
Leave me alone!
Executions should be interesting
Lin Zhen, it depends on who it is.
If it is the tartars who invaded us
Of course it is interesting
But today's convicts are patriots
They are all Han's martyrs
Do you still think it is interesting?
I...
Yesterday, I taught you sacrifice
For the sake of a righteous cause
Do you all understand?
Yes
Hurry up... It's here
Is he dead or alive?
He's so stiff, of course he's dead.
He's a hero
What did you say?
I...
- Capture him!  - Yes
You're an accomplice.
- Lord Tang... Listen to me
This student is not a bad man.
He's the son of a seafood shop owner
Son of a shop owner?
- Yes, exactly.
These are his classmates.
- Yes, we're his classmates
Where are you studying?
They all study in Chong Wen College
Are you vouching for them, Mr. Wang?
Yes. Apologize to Lord Tang
I...
You're too young and gauche.
Always causing trouble
Do you know who I am?
I do. Tang San-yao, Lord Tang.
Yes, let's go, quickly!
Uncle Wang, we didn't do anything!
Yes, I know.
Tang San-yao's notorious for his craze after money and women
You mustn't antagonize him.
As the saying goes:
"One must humble oneself under enemy's rule"
Mr. Ho... please open the door!
Who is it?
Mr. Ho
Mr. Ho
What's wrong?
I...
There's something we can't understand
So we've come here even at this hour
Humble oneself under enemy's rule
Do we and our children have to humble ourselves forever?
I say, we'd be beheaded if we don't.
If we fear not death we don't have to
You're right. It's well said
One brave man alone is not enough
But unity is strength
The tartars are well-armed.
We...
Men owes allegiance to his country
Lord Cheng is recruiting in Taiwan
He's become tartar's biggest trouble
The Manchurian emperor has ordered - coastal residents to move away and to be on their guard.
Mr. Ho, I wish Lord Cheng could use us.
The day will come.
Don't you all want to help?
Yes
Good. Come here.
- Yes
Secret documents will arrive by sea
I need a way to bypass customs.
Liu Yu-de, doesn't your pa run a seafood shop?  - Yes
Open sesame...
- Shut sesame...
Mr. Ho sent us here.
- Good
Little brother, you're a brave fellow.
Lock it up...
Yes, hurry...
Pa, has San Li's abalone arrived?
The abalone... Go, go now!
It has... The sea cucumber has too...
Te, what are you doing?
A big order for abalone was placed.
I am showing them some samples
So you're in business now?
Te, you can't take the whole case.
- I'm in a hurry to deliver it
Hurry? Do you know the market price?
The quality's high. Raise the price
Open it.
- Yes
Excellent kung fu.
- You'll find that at Shaolin Temple
Mr. Ho, we could invite them to...
Yes
They don't involve in worldly matters
If Shaolin taught kung fu to laymen - people could fight the tartars.
That would be great!
Yue Shan, South gate...
Here
General Tien
- Arise
Come over here
Lately, we've suppressed rebels - and found this on their leaders:
Zheng Cheng-gong's edict
Look, what have you been doing?
There must be many of Cheng's men hiding in Canton
We must capture the rebels
And kill them to scare them off
Who's that?  - No idea.
He's secretive, maybe a spy.
I'm innocent. I'm a delivery boy.
I've brought dried fish. Look!
Shut up
Lord Zheng, notorious rebels...
Who told you to bring this here?
No... no use to ask me
Kid, we'll take you away
And torture you one after another
See if you'll talk or not.
I'll talk... Don't torture me.
I... I say, there is someone
Go on with the torture - if you like!
I saw a squadron of Ching troops of over 100 patrolling our alley
Mr. Ho, what shall we do?
We must keep calm and be on the alert
Yien-pin, let them hide in your home.
Mr. Ho, what about you...?
Mr. Ho, Mr. Ho
Go quickly, go!  - What about you?
-Hurry up, quick
Master, look!
Please have mercy... please talk to them
Please ask them not to...
- Quiet!
General's order: No dried fish.
Then...
What's your relationship to Liu Yu-de?
He... he's my son.  - Bring him here
- He's not home...
Why do you want him?
- We've uncovered many spies recently
One's a teacher; another's his pupil
Liu Yu-de's a pupil of that school
We'll capture him and torture him!
Master, our young master won't...
Please have mercy
How do you know he wouldn't?
- Let's talk it over
Pa...
- Yu-de, run quickly... Yu-de
Young Master, run, run quickly...
Run quickly, Young Master
You want to rebel?
Yu-de, run quickly, run!
He's innocent! My son!
Liu Yu-de, come up quickly!
My son is innocent, my son!
Change your clothes at once
- I...
All wearing school uniform arrested
Wonder what's happened to my home?
- Try to find a hiding place first
We can find out later.
- Right, let's go now
What has happened to my home?
Your home...
- Tell me!
All the houses in the street next to your home have been cordoned off
What about my father?
Pa...
Don't be sad. It's the same for mine
I wish I had learned kung fu instead of studying
So I could fight them
Studies teach us right from wrong
What's the use of that?
We can't talk sense with the tartars
We can't stay in this town anymore
The martial arts headquarters is...
Shaolin Temple
We're lucky we made it
Let's go straight on
Did you see a group of men riding by?
Why don't you answer me?
Let's go!
Dismount and chase them
These two must be traitors
One watch the horses, others chase
Hurry up
Let's go
Liu Yu-de, mount it!
Liu Yu-de?
Liu Yu-de, escape now. Go!
Don't let him get away
Liu Yu-de, good luck!
Please give me some water
Thank you, uncle
How far is it to Shaolin Temple?
It's not far, only up the mountain.
But you look like you can't make it.
I can... even if I have to crawl there!
Sit down.
I don't think you can.
Shaolin monks buy food here everyday
Their cart is over there
Hurry up... Do it orderly and quickly
Get going, go!
Why is it so heavy?
Yes, I don't know why. Go.
You'll be punished if you're late.
Let's go, quick!
Push harder, harder, go!
Hurry up, park the cart there
Come and lend a hand, everybody
Why are you standing there, come here.
Take this to the kitchen. Be quick.
Why are you so slow?
Hurry up...
What's the matter?
What's that man doing there?
Stay calm, he can still be saved.
Bring him inside. I'll tell the abbot
Sir, the abbot would like to see you.
- Thank you
This temple is not a sanctuary.
You're spiteful and emotional.
Unfit to stay in the temple.
You're recovering, please leave soon
I had so much difficulty coming here.
I won't leave!
Don't be rude.
- Splendid
Since you are here...
It means you've affinity with Buddha.
Brother, you mustn't make exceptions.
He arrived here in a coma, but woke up after 10 days.
Perseverance to Buddhism warrants his admittance.
Dharma also came to the east with such perseverance - and laid the foundation of Shaolin.
What are your opinions, brothers?
You're right, brother.
Thank you abbot.
Morning, sir.
San Te, San Te
Morning, sir.
How long have you been here?
- Over a year
Are you unable to endure destitution?
No, not that, but...
Don't hide anything from the Buddha
Before I came here, I heard Shaolin is the headquarters of kung fu
But for the past year, I've only cleaned
I haven't seen any kung fu
You can learn kung fu if you want to
As long as they want to, any monk can learn from the 35 chambers.
If you don't tell us who would know?
Why do you want to learn kung fu?
Honestly, sir
Before I came here, -
I saw the people, oppressed by tyrannical rule.
If they were able to learn kung fu, they could defend themselves.
And combat enemies. Therefore...
Good, good, San Te
Buddhists shouldn't bear such thought.
Don't mention it again!
I won't be shaken.
I am determined
Sir, can I still learn kung fu?
There're 35 chambers in Shaolin.
Which chamber do you want to start?
Which is the most advanced?
The top chamber, of course!
Then I'll start from the top
Sir
Behold, the Buddha says:
Emptiness is the Eternal Five
No sight, sound, smell, taste, sense.
The five flavors dull the taste
The five tones deafen the ear
The five colors blind the eye
It can also not be seen
But it won't pass away
Being at one is eternal
But all things will come to you
Without wisdom... without...
Leave!
No wisdom, no gain
Gaining is not continuant
All men will come to me one
For there lies rest
And happiness and peace
It's invisible and inaudible
And it's inexhaustible
Can you hear the sound of bells?
The heart is calm. We hear nothing
How often do you recite the sutras?
I... I...
Go away!
Sir, I came to learn martial arts.
Get out!
No one learns martial arts here
This is the most advanced field
You won't understand it
I'm willing to start from the bottom
Cross the pond to enter dining hall
- Yes
Brother, this is the 35th chamber?
Shut up. You starve if you're late
Pure body is light, steps are stable.
Don't enter the hall if you're dirty.
How dare you enter this dining hall?
Sir, I want to...
- Have congee?
Come with me
Stand on the wood
Jump!
Turn around!
Eat!
Get up, you're hopeless.
Clean all the pottery and cutlery
Wall is low, power of Buddha is high.
He's fallen into it
Don't laugh, he's only a novice.
Enter the dining hall
San Te, you're terrific...
Concentrate. You'll find a way
Keep practicing day and night. Go!
Stop!
Wood drifts, its buoyancy is limited.
Harder you step, faster it sinks.
San Te.  - Yes
Throw the plate hard into water
The plate sinks down in water just like the wood you stepped upon.
I keep the plate in motion, balanced.
Similarly, step fast, balance body.
Uniformity of mind brings uniformity of maneuver.
You must keep this point in mind
Strength, balance, speed.
Strength, balance, speed. Right
Sir, I...
- Go!
I beg you to teach me, master.
34th chamber practice arms' strength
Fist, palm, knife, sword, pole, spear
All depend on arm strength. Look...
This is the basic process:
Carry the water up the slope
Pour it down to keep it flowing.
Remember, arms must be straight.
You should carry water everyday to build up arm strength. Go now.
I didn't think you'd make it so soon.
Don't help others when they practice.
It'll only ruin them
You've violated our rule. Leave...
Sir...
- Go to the 33rd Chamber
Thank you, sir
This chamber is comparatively easier
Whenever you hear me knock the wood -
Strike the gong.
Sir, I'm here to learn kung fu, not...
Don't little the bamboo poles. Ji Wei
The hammer weighs 10 catties
It is fitted into a 12-ft pole
A 12-ft pole and 10-catty hammer now weighs 120 catties
How much can your wrists bear?
I'm willing to try
Add on 2 more feet
Ready...
Keep practicing
My respects to the abbot
You've left the Wrist Room?
- Yes, the overseer said I could leave.
Good. Starting today...
As a reward for your diligence
You'll be in charge of Sutra Room.
Thank you, abbot.
Brother, San Te is ambitious
He's not like our Buddhist brothers
It's peaceful here in this temple
But outside it's turbulent
We may need someone like him
Please guide me, sir.
Stand between the two burning incense
- Yes
Anyone practicing martial arts must be sharp-eyed. Watch the lamp
When the lamp oscillates...
Your eyes should follow
But remember
Your head must not move.
Start!
Told you not to move your head.
Again
Right, the target has disappeared, - but still, the eyes shouldn't move.
Eyes be bright, limbs be nimble.
This is the way to do it
- Yes
Turn around
San Te, hit the reflecting blocks.
You're my most outstanding pupil
Thank you, sir.
Head Chamber
Continue
Don't lower your head. Stand up
Hands on your waist.
Use your head to hit the sand bags
Then burn incense before the Buddha
- Yes
Again
Get up
Sir, I...
- Collapsing so quickly?
Get up now. Continue. Go on
Sir
San Te. Only after 2 years hard work - you might be able to enter this alley.
San Te, head is the most important
And the last phase in the training
After going through it, you can learn fighting and weapons
Offer the incense
Use your strength to hit it. Get up!
You've set a new record
You've completed the basic skills of the 10 chambers in 25 months' time
I can't do it without the teachers
You can now practice boxing...
Knife, baton and other skills
- Yes
Justice Officer
I'll make him head of Dharma House
San Te, greet these two abbots.
- Yes
Stop!
Continue!
San Te!
Leg Chamber
Sir
- San Te, not bad, not bad
Sword Chamber
Turn around faster
Good fellow
San Te
San Te, it's commendable of you to master all 35 chambers of kung fu...
In only 5 years.
Now I'll make you deputy overseer of any of the 35 chambers
Brother, San Te's post is high enough.
He's been promoted 8 times in 5 years
With his present skill he is qualified to be deputy overseer
Shaolin arts has existed for 1000 years
We mustn't make a hasty decision
In my opinion...
Let him fight me with any weapon
If he succeeds, he can be an overseer.
You heard what he said
What do you think?
I dare not
It's my idea. If you win... you can take charge of any chamber
Excuse me then, sir.
Watch out
Thank you, sir. I've lost
You may challenge me any time
How many times have I tapped you?
- 17 times
I could've hurt you with the blade
You're right.
I'll continue with my practice
Brother, I think he'll never win.
- Not necessarily
What weapon is San Te using?
A two-jointed bar made by himself
Good, that blow was not bad.
Go on!
Sir, are you alright?
San Te, I still have my weapons.
Excuse me
Abbot, San Te can take charge of any chamber.
San Te, choose to take charge of any of the 35 chambers... except the Top Chamber.
Your Buddhism attainment is not advanced enough
Abbot, I've not yet made up my mind.
Never mind. I'll give you 3 days
Thank you, abbot.
There're only 35 chambers in Shaolin
There isn't a 36th chamber
I know. I'd like to create it...
This 36th chamber is...
It's a pity Shaolin martial arts is confined solely to the temple.
It should be taught widely to all
That's my idea for the new chamber
To teach martial arts to laymen
We don't involve in worldly affairs
Nor do we admit secular pupils
Forget it
Abbot, this affects the handing down of Shaolin martial arts to posterity.
Please let me enroll promising youths -
And train them in the 36th chamber.
Nonsense, how dare you talk back?
I don't mean to...
- Shut up!
I must ask you to reconsider, abbot.
Justice Officer
Our pupil San Te should be punished.
- Yes
San Te, you've violated our rule.
You have to collect contributions
Don't return unless the book is full.
Yes. Abbot, I deserve punishment
Leave tomorrow morning
You want to pray for Chiang Tai?
They all died
They were buried in East cemetery
Go there and pray for them
Uncle Wei, may you rest in peace
We will complete your mission
Hung Hsi-kuan, I knew you'd be here to bury your accomplices.
Run!
Go! See how you can escape.
Good! I'll kill you one after another
Go ahead and try.
Tang San-yao, you're so malicious.
Your vice will be punished.
- Scram, bloody monk.
Master, please stay out of this.
So you're an accomplice
Tang San-yao, remember 7 years ago - you confiscated my school and my shop and killed my whole family?
You're Liu Yu-de, a fugitive!
Get him!
Go help your brothers.
- Okay!
You're a Buddhist, show mercy.
Even Buddha has to conquer evil
A monk should not kill
A monk cannot but I can.
I'll do it!
Tang San-yao, you've killed my men
I'll stab you 1,000 times!
Amitabha Buddha
Thank God. Today, our martyrs can see you lying dead here
Master, I want to learn martial arts.
Please accept me as your pupil
Good. I've come from Shaolin to enroll promising youths
Hsi-kuan, is Tien Ta still in Canton?
- Yes
His hand is stained with Han's blood
We must eliminate him at all costs
We'll plan well.
Find a hideout first.
Don't act rashly
Do you know of other ambitious youth?
Yes, Tung Qian-jin is another
Tung Qian-jin, Commander's orders:
Make a batch of wheels
Deliver them within one month.
- I can't, it'll take one year.
One year? Are you turning me down?
Do you want to join the dead?
Want my help?
I'll teach you to be smarter
Beat him up!
Are you going to do it or not?
Not over my dead body
It is better to use the haft
Help!
Do you still want the wheels made?
No, no!  - Damn you!
- Good! Good!
Master, Master!
Master... Let me follow you.
Why?
I admire you. Please teach me.
Please take me as your pupil
Tung Qian-jin, what's wrong with you?
You said you won't admire anyone and will challenge even the Gods?
Why are you kneeling to a monk now?
What do you know? He's not a monk
He's a Bodhisattva
He only said several words and I scared the tartars away.
So he's a living Bodhisattva?
I'm only a monk from Shaolin Temple
I taught you to avoid direct contact
They've learned kung fu, you haven't
Using a heavy weapon slows you down
And puts you at a disadvantage.
- Right.
Lu Ah-cai, are you convinced now?
Master, it makes sense.
Lu Ah-cai, can you move?
Lu Ah-cai, don't make hasty moves.
Master, I'm convinced.
Master, I'm convinced.
Are you sure now?
- I am, I'm convinced
Master, please come in for some tea.
Master, I'm really convinced.
How did Tang San-yao die?
You still haven't found out yet?
He was chopped by a knife
I only want the man who chopped him.
Yes, we're investigating
Kill all suspects!
- Yes
You must be on alert.
Yes
This is General Tien Ta's residence
He patrols the city every day
And he must pass through this street when he goes to the city gates.
Shops on both sides of the street made it difficult for us to get him
Any households on this street?
- Yes
There is a rice-miller's shop
Back to back with General's residence
Are there many people living there?
- There seems to be only one person
Sir...
No one comes for offerings this late
What are you doing? Go away...
What do you mean by that?
Sir, please excuse me.
What do you want?
May I know your name, sir?
My father died without telling me my name.
So I have no name
I started milling rice when I was six
So they call me Miller Six
I'm San Te. I'm from Shaolin Temple
- People say that monks from Shaolin...
Are excellent at kung fu. No wonder...
I've practiced for several years
Having milled rice for many years
I also have a pair of strong feet.
Do you want to try them?
I've drunk a bit too much today.
But your footwork's not bad
Let's go in for a drink. Let's go!
You can't stay here much longer.
- Why not?
Very soon, something big will happen in the General's residence
What is it?
General Tien Ta's going to die here
How can you say something like that?
You aren't afraid of being executed?
Leave here at once, will you?
I don't care whether you come from
Shaolin or Linshao Temple
Please just leave. I beg you.
Ching tartars killed so many people
Don't you want to fight back?
I'm only a rice miller. Even if I do...
What can I do?
I'd rather drink
People continue to suffer because too many people have that attitude.
You'd put it more plainly
I want to borrow your place
No... If you do...
I won't be able to stay here anymore.
Don't worry. I'll take you to Shaolin
Lord Cheng, we caught them near the cemetery.
Kill them all!  - Yes
Stop!
Lord Cheng, I killed Tang San-yao.
Not them!
You?
How did you kill him?
With this
Take him!  - Yes
Where did you learn it?
In Shaolin Temple
Report to the General! Quick!
- Yes
Master, we're outnumbered.
- Yes, there're so many of them.
Everyday they wake me up early
Will you please calm down?
No, I can't. I'm Miller Six
This is flour
Commanders Tang and Cheng are famous
They failed because of...
If more monks are here
There will be a rebellion in Canton!
- Yes...
I'll bring some men to capture him.
Even if I have to go to Shaolin!
Go, go at once... Run!
Give me a sword
You, a monk, joining the rebels!
A Buddhist has to conquer evil.
How many lives have you taken?
I've killed many, but never a monk.
Stop!
Twist and turn around!
Okay. Hold it.
Is it all right if we get back to work now?
Thanks awfully. Sorry to be such a bore.
Not at all, Lady Charlotte.
It's rather fun.
Mr. Graham.
Hogan, your job is to look after the amphib, not lug that stuff around.
Well, one of us has to be nice to the lady, major.
Plucky little woman. Bit of a responsibility on a trip like this, though.
Didn't have a choice, Captain.
We agreed to take a reporter from the newspaper that financed us.
- They sent her.
- Be fair, Ben, she does take good pictures.
Maybe. But she's one problem
I could do without.
If the weather holds, we should reach the last known position of your friend Tyler in 3 days.
At which point, we should sight the coastline of this mysterious ice continent he describes in his log.
You sound as though you still have your doubts, Captain.
If we did, major, The Royal Navy wouldn't be helping you.
No, it was the specimens that Tyler included in this canister.
And when Dr. Norfolk here, confirmed that they were genuine...
Why do you think
I went to the top man in Europe?
Oh, now, hardly, Ben.
Dr. Schenkelman in Vienna...
Oh, come on, doctor.
If it hadn't been for your word,
The London Times would never have agreed to back this expedition, and you know it.
I don't think I'll ever forget the day when Major Ben McBride walked into my room at the Natural
History Museum with that canister.
- Almost spilled your hot milk, didn't you?
- It was quite a moment, Ben.
Tyler makes it sound a very dangerous place.
A continent full of cavemen and dinosaurs?
Do you really believe there's a chance that Tyler may still be alive?
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
Doc knows where I stand.
- I don't give a damn about dinosaurs.
- I'm still hoping to convert him.
Boy, I'm sure glad we're going in by air, major.
Me, too, Hogan.
I'd hate to have to climb that.
I'd say it was almost impossible.
And I'm quite good at this sort of thing.
- Did I ever tell you about the Matterhorn?
- Once or twice.
- Just how long have we got, Captain?
- 3 to 4 weeks. Half what we planned, but we hadn't expected so much pack ice.
If it closes in on us...
Come on, Captain. This ship is built like the rock of Gibraltar.
It may be, Mr. Hogan, but that ice could crush this hull like a matchbox.
- And if that happened...
- There'll be no trip home for any of us.
Okay, Hogan, let's winch the amphibian into the water.
The sooner we get airborne, the better.
- Hogan!
- Okay, let's go.
McBride to Polar Queen, flying southwest. Altitude 3,000 feet.
Still no breaks in the ice.
Turning southeast, and climbing at 5,000 feet. Over.
Roger. Polar Queen listening. Over.
McBride to Polar Queen, still no break in the ice wall.
Course south by southwest. Over.
Polar Queen to McBride, your signal is badly distorted.
What is your present course? Over.
Can't give you...
Polar Queen to McBride, Say again. Over.
Mainly static for the last 2 hours, sir, but they're still transmitting, and I think they're still airborne.
At least they're alive.
And they've flown over 200 miles.
Must be well over the ice wall by now.
Hey, what the...
It's a pterodactyl!
Absolutely magnificent!
Coming in on the starboard, major!
Here he comes. Look at the size!
Look out! He's close!
Hogan!
Right.
Coming in at port, major.
Hold on! This may be a little rough.
- I'll try to smooth out the bumps next time.
- Nonsense. You did extremely well.
- Still in one piece?
- Just. How about the plane?
- Hogan?
- Yeah.
- What kind of shape we in?
- Well, not good. But it's fixable.
McBride to Polar Queen, can you read me? Over.
Polar Queen to McBride, your signal's very faint. Go ahead.
We have been attacked by a giant pterodactyl.
Good Lord!
Damage to amphib... had to make forced landing...
Polar Queen to McBride, this is Captain Lawton.
How bad is damage to plane?
McBride to Polar Queen, acknowledge my message. Over.
I say again, how bad is damage to plane?
- No dice?
- It's hard to tell.
- Not much they could do anyway.
- Well, if they sail away, we're sunk.
Nobody's gonna sail away, Hogan.
There's plenty of time for everything.
- Any luck, Mr. Graham?
- No, sir. They've stopped transmitting.
Will they get that plane back into the air?
There's no way we can send a rescue party in over those cliffs.
- What the devil are we going to do, sir?
- We're going to wait, Mr. Whitby.
We shall chart this section of the coastline, and we shall stay here as long as we can.
- Mount a 24-hour listening watch, Mr. Graham?
- Aye, aye, sir.
But supposing the ice closes in, sir.
Let me worry about that, will you,
Mr. Whitby? Start work on the charts, please.
Aye, aye, sir!
Ready... heave!
Ready... heave!
Okay. Let's take 5.
What we really need is a winch.
- Yeah, well, we haven't got one.
- You know, what we really need is a winch.
Yeah.
We must remember to bring one next time.
Go easy on that stuff, Hogan.
It's just a little "nerve tonic," major.
The war, remember?
- Well, this isn't the western front.
- You're absolutely right. It's worse.
No, no, believe me. I was there.
Pterodactyls are far more interesting than Germans.
Interesting?
Doc, you professor types are all the same.
Pterodactyls?
You give me the Red Baron any day.
Anyway, all I want to do Is fix up that amphibian and get us the hell out of here.
What are you talking about?
We just started.
We came here to get Tyler, and that's what we're going to do.
You better call in the Navy, because we are going to need some reinforcements.
You worry too much, Hogan.
Get that prop fixed and check out the tail.
- How's it going?
- Oh, quite well, thank you.
Oh, could I have a photograph of you?
Well, yeah.
Where do you want me?
That rock will do fine.
Makes a good background.
Right.
Okay.
Hold it.
I think McBride's found something you might like to look at.
Really?
You're a real barrel of laughs, you know it?
A fully grown stegosaurus.
Now, isn't that absolutely beautiful?
I hope you appreciate this moment, Ben.
Aren't they supposed to be very docile and very stupid?
- Well, in theory, yes.
- Especially the female of the species.
You know, I've got a feeling we've just found our winch.
Why don't we use him to tow the amphib out?
Actually, that's not a bad idea.
It looks big enough.
But suppose he doesn't want to.
All we've got to do is tie a rope to his tail and make him run away.
- They should make a good anchor point.
- Yeah.
- Is he going to feel this?
- No, not yet.
His nervous system works about 100 times slower than ours.
I hope you're right.
Hogan!
- Ready?
- Hold onto your hat.
Hey! Charly!
Get the hell out of the way, goddamn it!
Keep your shirt on.
Go on! Go on!
Go on!
Go!
She's clear!
Now, how are we going to stop it?
Major!
Attaboy, major!
Come on, major!
I'm going for the rocks!
Major!
Oh, boy.
Isn't it marvelous? It worked!
You almost got yourself killed.
Listen, your family's newspaper may be paying for this trip, but from now on, just quit clowning around. Understand?
Come on. Now, don't get sore at the major.
Look, I was with him for three years in France. He's all right.
He's just a little worried about what he's got us into, you being a lady and all.
You promised to forget that, remember?
As for McBride, don't worry,
I can look after myself.
I'm going to have to cut about 10 inches off each of those blades to balance them off.
Then we're going to lose a lot of thrust.
Will it get us in the air?
If none of us has too big a breakfast, yes.
How long do you figure it'll take?
Well, with the rudder and all the other items, it's going to be... it's going to be about 3 or 4 days.
Can't afford to lose that much time.
- You two game to go in on foot?
- Yes!
- Yes.
- You're crazy!
For all we know, Tyler could be sitting just on the other side of these hills.
We get up to that ridge, we may be able to see some of those peaks he described.
We'll be heading due south.
In 3 days time, I'll send up a flare, at 9:00 in the morning and 3:00 in the afternoon.
We could be back before you're through here.
- What about the goddamn monsters?
- Trust me.
I looked after you in France, didn't I?
The way I remember it,
I was the one who saved your life.
That's what I mean, Hogan.
I owe you one, right?
Right.
Well, let's get started.
You still annoyed at having to bring me along?
No, not really. It's just that certain kinds of girls are hard to take.
Oh, you mean my kind?
Well, the world's a changing place, McBride.
You know what the real problem is?
You just can't stand competition.
Lady, I believe in a man doing a man's work, that's all.
- What is it, doc?
- It can only be one thing... prehistoric.
Definitely prehistoric.
That's human.
Ben!
- You hurt?
- No. Thanks.
A genuine cavegirl.
She'll suit you perfectly.
She's all yours, doc. You're the expert.
In fossils, perhaps.
This is a little outside my field.
Don't touch!
She speaks English.
- That's crazy.
- No, it doesn't make sense.
Ben. See this knife she's carrying?
It's a Bowie knife.
I don't know how the hell she got it.
Well, yes, she must have been in contact with Tyler.
- Tyler.
- Good God! She knows the name.
What is your name?
Ajor.
Ajor, listen, did Tyler teach you to speak our language?
Yes. He teach you, too?
No. Tyler and me learned together.
Grow up together.
Tyler is a friend of mine.
I guess he's a friend of yours, too?
Was good man... all gone.
Gone now.
Ajor has no friends.
- No people.
- Pull that photograph of Tyler.
Ajor...
Look.
Go on... take it.
Your friend Tyler seems to have made quite an impression.
Why don't you... go and light a fire or something?
Right, I've got the whole story.
She comes from a race of people called the Galu.
It's a Stone Age tribe, or at least it was when Tyler and a girl called Lisa stumbled into one of their settlements.
Lisa, wasn't that the girl that Tyler rescued?
That's right. The only other survivor of the original party.
Go on.
Well, it appears that Tyler and the girl were welcomed by the Galu
- and lived with them for more than 2 years.
- I'm glad somebody's friendly.
During that time, they taught the Galu farming skills, generally helped them advance from the Stone Age into the Iron Age.
Why is she so upset over Tyler's picture?
Because another more advanced race, called the Naga, didn't like the competition.
They massacred every Galu they could lay their hands on.
Is... Tyler dead?
Well, there's a chance that Tyler and Lisa may have been captured.
The Nagas usually sacrifice their prisoners to appease their volcano god.
Well, in this case, it would make more sense to keep them alive.
Their knowledge would help the advance of the Nagas.
Well, I hope not.
They sound a pretty vile bunch.
Ajor was one of the few Galus to escape.
And she's been on the run ever since.
- When did all this happen?
- About 4 months ago.
Then there's a good chance that Tyler may still be alive.
Can Ajor take us to where the Nagas live?
Goddamn it, another one. I told you...
I told you what I was going to do.
I told you.
Don't these things ever sleep?
The island never sleeps.
Here.
Take it away! Take it away! Take it away!
Oh, God!
- That's a big one.
- Oh, that's a beauty!
That's a Poecilotheria fasciata.
It's not funny!
I don't believe it, Charly.
I thought nothing could faze you.
Hairy plane ride, Ajor's friend in the forest, you took them on without blinking an eye.
- And along comes this little spider...
- Little?
It was cute.
It was kind of cuddly, too, wasn't it?
Now, stop it.
You're making my flesh creep.
At least it proves you're human.
Well, everyone has their breaking point, McBride.
With me, it's spiders.
With you... it's me.
- What is it?
- Band-lu.
- A hunting party?
- I hope they're not hunting us.
In that case,
I shall try and get a picture.
Hold it.
Galu! Galu!
Flare pistol.
Ajor, no!
His name is Mikay.
He was good friend of Tyler.
Did he have time to say anything about Tyler?
He was taken with many others to mountain of skulls, the city where the Nagas live.
- Can you take us there?
- Yes. But it's hopeless.
Even if you can get in, you can never escape Nagoramata.
- Who's he?
- The volcano god of the Nagas.
He rules the land.
No one can go against his will and live.
- Where's Ajor going?
- She's looking for the entrance to a cave.
If she finds it, it'll make life a lot easier.
We'd be crazy to go over the top if there's a shortcut.
Ben!
Get out of here!
You bounder!
Leave me! Leave me!
He's awake.
Ben? Ben, can you hear me?
Norfolk, Charly, you all right?
We thought you were dead.
Where are we?
At the entrance of the Band-lu camp, behind you, up the slope.
Any idea what they plan to do with us?
I think we're some sort of offering.
These stakes were in the ground when we got here.
You mean a sacrificial offering?
No.
No, not religious.
Something more practical.
Somebody's dinner then?
Sorry, Charly.
You're okay, you know that?
I think it's better not to talk.
Some of them hunt by sound, rather than smell.
Oh, good girl, my notes.
I get for you. Band-lu not see.
Great. No gun, no ammunition.
God knows what we'll do if they follow us.
They won't. They're afraid to cross over the boundary.
Hogan to Polar Queen.
Hogan to Polar Queen.
Look, I can't hear you. I just hope you're still out there, all right?
Our repairs to the plane are just about finished. I still have to test-fly the ship.
If she checks out all right, then I'm going to look out for the major.
From what I've seen of this place, there's going to be a problem in trying to find somewhere to land.
Anyway, the deal is, if they're not back after 3 weeks, I fly out on my own.
So don't you go on off without me, you hear?
Some deal.
Anyway, it's nice talking to you.
This is Hogan. Out.
What do you think of it, Norfolk?
Absolutely remarkable!
Do you think it's safe?
There's only one way to find out...
Keep moving.
Charly.
Come on! That's it, that's it!
Okay, baby, don't you let me down!
Okay, let her go! Move it up!
This is the country of the Nagas.
- Looks pretty grim.
- So are the Nagas.
It's 9:00. Time to put up a flare.
Nagas!
Welcome.
You are surprised I speak your tongue.
Your friend Tyler, he has taught us much already.
- We heard he was a prisoner.
- And you came to rescue him?
Did that creature fill you with these lies?
Tyler's a man of great power who honors us with his presence.
It is he who sent me to welcome you. Come with me.
I can't believe Tyler talking these guys around.
- Well, you always said he was a survivor.
- Yeah, but how did he know we were coming?
Good question. Unfortunately, we have to visit the mountain of skulls to learn the answer.
Goddamn it! When I put you together, you stay together!
Oh, no!
No, no, I haven't heard from the major yet.
Should be back any day now.
I'll call you tomorrow, all right?
Okay, Hogan. Over and out.
Hogan? Yeah?
If I don't get out of here, you're gonna go bananas.
Yeah.
- I thought you were going to see Tyler.
- So did I.
Hold your tongue! Only Sabbala speaks.
Take your hands off me!
Let me go.
Let me go!
Nagoramata.
Good fortune smiles upon you.
Soon you will become brides of Nagoramata.
Ben?
- Ben McBride!
- Bowen!
No... it's not possible!
Yes, it's me.
- It's Tyler, he's right next door.
- Wonderful!
You son of a gun, we'd almost given up hope of finding you.
Yes, we had a rough time getting here.
Anyway, thank goodness we found you.
- You mean, you came here to find me?
- Sure. We got the message from the canister.
Yeah, it was picked up off the coast of Scotland at the end of 1917.
Oh, my name is Edwin Norfolk, by the way.
Good to meet you, sir.
Ben.
Sabbala say,
"soon your bodies will feel warmth
"of Nagoramata's love.
Your heads will help build new temple
"in his honor."
Did he say when?
At the rising of his sister... the sun.
Ben.
I...
- I'd given up hope.
- Yeah, I know. Me, too.
My folks, Ben, how are they?
Your ma and pa are both fine.
In fact, it was your pa that got me into this thing.
He hasn't changed much, has he?
It didn't take much persuading.
Ben... the war?
It's over, Bo. There'll be plenty of time to talk about that.
Right now, the girls who came with us are in trouble.
Girls?
- Sabbala?
- Yeah, and he looks like bad news.
He is.
Well, in that case, we haven't got a moment to waste.
One of the girls is a friend of yours... Ajor.
Ajor, the Galu?
Yeah. I'll explain later.
Where have they got Lisa?
She's dead.
Sabbala killed her.
We wouldn't cooperate with the Nagas.
Looks as though they gave you a pretty rough time.
They smashed 2 years of hard work.
Wiped out a whole race of people.
Sacrificed Lisa to the volcano.
No!
Ben, my stick.
Barricade the door.
Nagoramata! When he speaks, all die!
Ben, we gotta go down here.
It's the only way.
- My camera!
- Forget it.
No, look, it's just in there.
Along with your notes.
- Yes, yes, I'll get it. I'll get it.
- Norfolk!
Norfolk!
Hurry!
Stay where you are!
Wait till they settle down.
- Charly, this is no time for pictures.
- Shut up and help.
Okay, now, you've got to wind that up there, underneath.
And that sets it off there, but don't forget to close your eyes.
Get set to run on the count of 3.
Ben... you go on ahead. I'll slow 'em down.
Give you a chance to get through that cave.
How you gonna stop 'em? With rocks?
No dice, Bo. I didn't come all this way to leave you behind.
What the hell, Ben?
I buy it here or I buy it later.
We may get away from the Nagas, but we'll never get home.
Once we get to that amphib, we're home and dry.
The land'll stop you, Ben. It's alive.
That volcano is its heart.
It controls everything.
- How can the land be alive?
- Ask Ajor if we can get out of here.
Only wish I had something to hold them off with.
Here, take this.
And this spare magazine.
- Move! Norfolk!
- Go on.
Go on!
In! Go in!
Bo!
- Stupid, goddamn stunt.
- No!
Easy.
Remember...
- when we were kids, Ben?
- Yeah.
I always wanted to play the hero.
Easy.
Only then... arrows weren't real.
- Easy.
- Ben...
I told you... there's... there's no escape.
Goddamn it.
Where's Tyler?
Ajor!
Hogan calling Polar Queen.
Hogan calling Polar Queen!
Are you receiving me?
Come on! Get off!
Oh, no!
Come on! Steady.
Dirty old nag!
Come on!
Get out of it!
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Let go! Help! Let go!
Ajor, get back! Get back!
Move!
Ben!
Get out of here! Get out of here!
Go on!
We've got to move now, sir.
If those icebergs close in...
Very well, Mr. Whitby.
Get her underway, will you?
We'll move back 5 miles. Be ready to transmit our position in case they make contact.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Engine room, prepare to get underway.
- You okay?
- Oh, just.
I didn't believe what Tyler said about this island.
- I'm beginning to think he was right.
- It's a complete and utter disaster.
Come on, it's not as bad as that.
We're doing okay.
I'm not talking about that.
I've lost my satchel in there.
All my notes and everything!
Don't worry. I've still got my camera.
Boatswain reports channel clear, sir.
- Very good, Mr. Whitby. Keep her moving.
- Very good, sir.
Band-lu. Make them go away with fire gun.
- I've run out of flares. How about you, Ben?
- Three shots left.
For heaven's sake, I'm sick and tired of running away from those dreadful people.
Get up.
Get going, Charly. Otherwise I'll kick your butt from here to the plane.
You'd never be a major in the British army.
Goddamn it, major, where the hell are you?
- Anything at all, Mr. Graham?
- I'm afraid not, sir.
Keep transmitting our position. And let them know we're moving out in the morning.
I'll be damned! Major!
Come on!
Okay, let's move it.
Come on!
- You didn't get Tyler?
- No, but I brought you a present.
- Got any of that "nerve tonic" left?
- Yeah, I sure have.
You cut it pretty fine, major.
I was worried this whole place was going to shake apart before you got back here.
It's about to.
We're being followed by a volcano.
Yeah... what?
Ajor, don't worry.
Everything'll be all right.
We've lost a lot of thrust on that cut-down prop, major.
You'll have to open her right up on the chocks or we'll never get out of here!
Hogan!
All clear! Let's go, major!
She won't climb any higher.
We have to lighten the ship.
Norfolk, throw out everything you can!
It's our only hope. Out!
My camera! My camera!
Major! We did it!
McBride to Polar Queen. McBride to
Polar Queen, how do you read me? Over.
What the devil's going on?
Any luck, major?
The ship! The ship!
Great going!
Look, sir!
It's them! The amphib!
He has no power.
By God, they've made it!
- Muster rescue party.
- Very good, sir.
"Congratulations on incredible escape.
Safe voyage home."
May I also add my congratulations to that?
And also, for...
Mr. Graham, you... and also for bringing back such a charming souvenir.
Oh, yes, sir. It's all rather fun.
Why, that's not bad.
That's not bad at all.
You know, I can't wait to walk you down the main street of North Flats, Nebraska.
Nebraska? No volcanoes?
No, but they're sure gonna explode when they see you.
You know, Hogan, this is rather like your "nerve tonic."
Professor, have some of the real thing.
Thank you.
That makes life look a lot rosier.
You know, my uncle will have a heart attack when we get back empty-handed.
In fact, he'll probably fire me.
Maybe you weren't meant to make your name in pictures.
- Got any other ideas?
- I'll think of something.
- Charly?
- Yes?
Why didn't you tell me about that gun you had stashed in your camera case?
I was keeping it in case we got into a jam.

You're going to be as beautiful as your mother.

Careful, Toulouse.
You're making it very difficult for Edgar.
Whoa, Frou-Frou, whoa.
Steady, girl.
Thank you, Edgar.
Oh. Of course, Frou-Frou.
I almost forgot.
Madame... uh, may I take your parcel, Madame?
It really is much too heavy for you, Madame.
Now, tut-tut, Edgar.
Don't fuss over me.
Berlioz, come back here.
Haven't you forgotten something, darling?
Thank you, Miss Frou-Frou, for letting me ride on your back.
You're quite welcome, young man.
How was that, Mama?
Very good, darling.
That was very nice.
Come along, Duchess. Kittens.
Come along.
Oh, and Edgar,
I'm expecting my attorney,
Georges Hautecourt.
You'll remember him, of course.
Of course, Madame.
How could anyone forget him?

Elevators are for old people. Whoops!
May I give you a hand, sir?
You haven't got an extra foot, have you, Edgar?
That always makes me laugh, sir.
Every time.
- Whoo!

Careful, sir. Please.
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Don't panic, Edgar.
Upward and onward! Whee!
Am I going too fast for you, Edgar?
Please, sir, hold...
There now, Duchess. That's better.
We must both look our best for Georges.
He's our oldest and dearest friend, you know.
Come in.
Announcing...
Monsieur...
Georges...
Hautecourt.
Oh, my goodness, Edgar.
I know Georges.
Adelaide, my dear.
So good to see you, Georges.
Aaah!
Still the softest hands in all Paris.
You're a shameless flatterer, Georges.
Adelaide, that's music.
It's from Carmen, isn't it?
That's right. It was my favourite role.
Yes, yes.
It was the night of your grand premiere that we first met. Remember?
- Oh, indeed, I do.
- And how we celebrated your success.
Champagne, dancing the night away...
Oh, Georges.
Oh, ho!
Thank goodness.
Just in time.
Ah, Georges.
We're just a pair of sentimental old fools.
Now, Georges, do be serious.
I've asked you to come here on a very important legal matter.
Oh? Oh!
Splendid, splendid.
Who do you want me to sue, eh?
Come now, Georges. I don't wish you to sue anyone.
I simply want to make my will.
Will, eh? Will, will...
Now, then, who are the beneficiaries?
Well, as you know, I have no living relatives.
Naturally, I want my beloved cats to be always well-cared for.
Certainly, no one can do this better than my faithful servant, Edgar.
Edgar?
Adelaide, you mean to say you're leaving your vast fortune to Edgar?
Everything you possess?
Stocks and bonds?
This mansion? Your country chateau?
Your treasures, jewels, and...?
Oh, no, no, Georges.
- To my cats.
- To your cats?
Cats?
Yes, Georges.
I simply wish to have the cats inherit first.
Then, at the end of their lifespan, my entire estate will revert to Edgar.
Cats inherit first?
And I come after the cats.
I, me, after...
It's... it's not fair.
Whoo! I mean, whoo.
Each cat will live about 12 years.
I can't wait... And each cat has nine lives.
That's four times 12...
Multiply by nine times...
No, it's less than that. Anyway, it's much longer than I'd ever live.
I'll be gone.
No.
Oh, no. They'll be gone.
I'll think of a way.
Oh... there are a million reasons why I should.
All of 'em dollars.
Millions.
Those cats have got to go.
Wait for me, wait for me!
Me first, me first. Whoo.
Why should you be first?
Because I'm a lady, that's why.
Ha-ha. You're not a lady.
You're nothin' but a sister.
Oh!
I'll show you if I'm a lady or not.
- You're tickling.
- Get her, Berlioz, get her.
Fight fair, Marie.
Females never fight fair.
Ow! Now, that hurt.
Mama! Mama!
Marie, darling, Marie, you must stop that.
This, this is really not ladylike.
And Berlioz?
Such behaviour is most unbecoming to a lovely gentleman.
Well, she started it.
Ladies do not start fights, but they can finish them.
Berlioz.
Now, don't be rude.
We were just practising biting and clawing.
Aristocrats do not practise biting and clawing and things like that.
That's just horrible.
But someday we might meet a tough alley cat.
That will do.
It's time we concerned ourself with self-improvement.
You want to grow up to be lovely charming ladies and gentlemens.
Now, Toulouse, you go and start on with your painting.
Yes, Mama.
Mama, may we watch Toulouse paint before we start our music lesson?
Please?
Well, yes, my love, but...
- Whoops.
- ...you must be very quiet.
Uh-Oh.
Mm-hm. Mm-mm-hm.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
It's Edgar.
Yeah, old pickle-puss Edgar.
"Old pickle-puss"? Now, now.
Berlioz, that is not kind.
You know Edgar is so fond of all of us and takes very good care of us.

Oh. Good evening, my little ones.
Your favourite dish, prepared a very special way.
It's crème de la crème à la Edgar.
Sleep well... I mean, eat well, of course.
Good evening, Duchess.
- Hello, kittens.
- Hello, Roquefort.
- Hi, Roquefort.
- Good evening, Monsieur Roquefort.
Mm. Something smells awfully good.
What is that appetising smell?
It's crème de la crème à la Edgar.
Won't you join us,
Monsieur Roquefort?
Well, yes. I mean...
I don't mean to interrupt.
But...
But it so happens that I have a cracker with me.
Come on, Roquefort, have some.
Oh, thank you. Don't mind if I do.
Just a few dunks.
Mm. Oooh. Very good.
My compliments to the chef.
Mm. This is yummy.
Mm.
Delicious.
Double delicious.
This calls for another cracker.
I'll be right back.
So that's... crème de la crème... a la...
Edgar.
Ahhh!
Lafayette. Hey, Lafayette.
Lafayette!
- Well, I'm right here.
- Listen.
Wheels approaching.
Oh, Napoleon, we done bit six tyres today.
Chased four motorcars and a bicycle and a scooter.
Hush your mouth.
It's a motorcycle.
Two-cylinder, chain drive, one squeaky wheel on the front, it sounds like.
You go for the tyres, and I'll go right for the seat of the problem.
How come you always grab the tender part for yourself?
'Cause I outrank you, that's why.
Now, stop beating your gums and sound the attack.
No, that's mess call.
Yeah, made a mess of it, huh?
You can be replaced, you know.
OK, let's charge. Oooh.
Wait a minute. I'm the leader.
I'm the one that says when we go.
Here we go.
Charge!
Whew.
Ahh! Oww!
Nice doggy, nice doggy.
Heel, roll over, play dead!
Yow!
This sure beats running, Napoleon.
Step on the gas, Napoleon.
I got 'er wide open.
Oww!
Oh!
Oh, where am I?
I'm not at home at all.
Children, where are you? Answer me.
Berlioz?
Toulouse, Marie, where are you?
Here I am, Mama.
Marie, darling. Well, are you all right?
Uh, I guess I had a nightmare and fell out of bed.
Now, Marie, darling, don't be frightened.
Mama! Mama!
That's Berlioz.
Over here, darling.
Berlioz, here we are.
And don't worry. Everything's going to be all right.
I'm coming, Mama.
Gee, I'm cold and I'm wet.
Mama?
Mama!
Darling.
That's only a little frog, my love.
He had a mouth like a hippo-lotamus.
Oh, what's so funny?
Not now, darling. Darlings, you just stay here.
I go and I look for Toulouse.
Toulouse?
Toulouse, where are you?
- Toulouse!
- Toulouse!
Toulouse!
Hey! What's all the yelling about, huh?
Why didn't you answer?
Mama, he's been here all the time.
Oh, thank goodness.
Are you all right?
I was having a funny dream.
Edgar was in it.
And we were all riding and bouncing along...
Frogs? Uh-oh. It wasn't a dream.
- Edgar did this to us.
- Edgar?
Oh, darling, why, that's...
Why, that's ridiculous.
Yeah, maybe you fell on your head, Toulouse.
Mama, I'm afraid. I wanna go home.
Now, my darling, don't be frightened. You'll see...
Oh, dear. Let's get into the basket, all of us.
What's gonna happen to us?
Well, darlings, I just don't know.
It does look hopeless, doesn't it?
I wish we were home with Madame right now.
Oh, poor Madame.
She will be so worried when she finds us gone.
Duchess? Kittens?
Oh, my gracious.
I had the most horrible dream about them.
Thank goodness it was only a dream.
Oh, dear, what a terrible night.
Now, now, my darlings.
Don't be frightened.
The storm will soon pass.
Oh, no! They're gone.
Duchess! Kittens!
Duchess! Where are you?
They're gone. They're gone!
Duchess? Kittens? Gone?
Why, that's terrible.
But where? Why?
Good heavens. Anything could happen to them on a night like this.
Get washed down a storm drain, struck by lightning...
Oh, they'll need help.
I've just got to find them.

That's right. And I'm very proud of that.
Yeah.
Bravo.
Very good. You are a great talent.
Oh, thank you.
And what might your name be?
My name is Duchess.
Duchess.
Beautiful. Love it.
And those eyes.
Oooh.
Why, your eyes are like sapphires sparkling so bright.
They make the morning radiant and light.
- How romantic.
- Sissy stuff.
Very poetic.
But it is not quite Shakespeare.
Of course not. That's pure O'Malley, baby.
Right off the cuff.
I got a million of them.
Oh, no more, please.
I am really in a great deal of trouble.
Trouble?
Helping beautiful dames... uh, uh, damsels in distress is my specialty.
Now, what's the hang-up, your ladyship?
Well, it is most important that I get back to Paris.
So if you would be just so kind and show me the way...
Show you the way?
Perish the thought.
We shall fly to Paris on a magic carpet, side by side, with the stars as our guide.
Just we two.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Three?
Four?
Five?
Oh, yes, Monsieur O'Malley.
- These are my children.
- Oh, how sweet.
Do you really have a magic carpet?
- Are we really gonna ride on it?
- Now, now, Marie.
Mama, do I have sparkling sapphire eyes
- that dazzle, too?
- Did I say that?
Yes, right off your cuff.
And you said we're gonna ride on your magic carpet.
Well, now, uh...
What I meant... You see, I...
No poetry to cover the situation, Monsieur O'Malley?
What I had in mind was kind of a sports model, baby.
- You know, one of those...
- Perhaps a magic carpet?
Built for two?
I wouldn't take up much room.
I understand perfectly,
Monsieur O'Malley.
Well, come along, darlings.
I'm a tough alley cat, too.
Hey, there.
You're coming on. I bet you're a real tiger in your neighbourhood.
Yeah. That's 'cause
I practise all the time.
Now, now, Toulouse.
Toulouse, come along, dear.
Yes, Mama.
See you around, tiger.
Now, that's quite a family.
Come to think of it, O'Malley, you're not a cat. You're a rat.
Right? Right.
- Hey, hey, hold up there.
- Yes, Monsieur O'Malley?
Now look, kids, if I said magic carpet, magic carpet it's gonna be.
And it's gonna stop for passengers... wright... here.
Oh, boy, we're gonna fly after all.
Another flight into the fantasy, Monsieur O'Malley?
No, no, no, baby.
You just hide over there, and you leave the rest to J. Thomas O'Malley.
Quick, Mom, get in here.
- But, children...
- Hurry up, Mama, hurry.
One magic carpet, coming up.
That's a magic carpet?
Sacré bleu!
Sapristi! Stupid cat.
Brainless lunatic.
All right, step lively.
All aboard for Paris.
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you could have lost your life.
So I got a few to spare. Nothin'.
- How can we ever thank you?
- My pleasure entirely.
Aloha. Auf weidersehen.
Bonsoir. Sayonara.
And all those goodbye things, baby.
Sayonara, mister...
Mama!
Marie! Marie!
Oh, Marie, are you all right?
- Yes, Mama.
- Haven't we met before?
And I'm so very glad we did.
Thank you, Mr. O'Malley, for saving my life.
No trouble at all, little princess.
And when we get to Paris, I'll show you the time of your life.
Oh, I'm so sorry, but... we just couldn't.
You see, my mistress will be so worried about us.
Well, humans don't really worry too much about their pets.
Oh, no. You just don't understand.
She loves us very much.
Poor Madame, in that big mansion, all alone.
In all our days, in tender ways,
her love for us was shown.
And so you see, we can't leave her alone.
She'd always say that we're the greatest treasure she could own.
Because with us she never felt alone.
Oh, Roquefort, I've been so worried about you.
Did you have any luck at all?
Not a sign of them, Frou-Frou.
And I've searched all night.
I know. And poor Madame didn't sleep a wink, either.
Oh, it's a sad day for all of us.
Morning, Frou-Frou, my pretty steed.
Can you keep a secret, hmm?
Of course you can.
I have some news straight from the horse's mouth, if you'll pardon the expression, of course.
Look, Frou-Frou.
I've made the headlines.
"Mysterious Catnapper
Abducts Family of Cats."
Aren't you proud of me?
So he's the catnapper.
The police said it was a professional, masterful job.
The work of a genius.
Not bad, eh, Frou-Frou old girl?
Oh, they won't find a clue to implicate me.
Not one single clue.
Why, I'll eat my hat if they...
My hat!
My umbrella!
Oh, oh, gracious.
I've got to get those things back tonight.
But... oh, you...
Why, that... sneaky, crooked, no-good butler!
- Anyone for breakfast?
- What breakfast?
- Where is it?
- Right under that magic carpet.
But now we have to cook up a little spell.
You know. Ready?
All right. First, to make the magic begin, you wiggle your nose.
And tickle your chin.
Now you close your eyes.
And cross your heart.
Then presto, breakfast à la carte.
Hooray!
- We did it.
- Look, Mama, look!
Why, Mr. O'Malley, you are amazing.
True.
True.
Sapristi!
Sacré bleu!
Thieves! Robbers!
Mangy tramps!
Take that and that!
Oh. Oh, what a horrible, horrible human.
Well, some humans are like that,
Duchess. I've learned to live with it.
I'll show him.
Hey, cool it, you little tiger.
- That guy's dynamite.
- But he called us tramps.
Oh, I'll be so glad when we get back home.
That's a long way off, so we better get moving.
Gee whiz.
Look at that bridge.
Come on, let's play train.
Now, be careful, children.
Marie's the caboose. All aboard!
Choo choo choo, choo choo choo.
Choc choo choo choo...
Clickedy, clickedy, clickedy, clickedy.
- Oh, no.
- Don't panic.
Down underneath here.
- Mama!
- Marie!
Oh, Marie!
Keep your head up,
Marie! Here I come!
Thomas! Thomas, up here.
Gee, Marie, why did you have to fall off the bridge?
Thomas! Oh, Thomas! Take care!
I'm all right, honey, don't worry.
I'll see you downstream.
What beautiful countryside, Abigail.
- So much like our own dear England.
- Indeed, yes.
Amelia, if I walk much farther I'll get flat feet.
Abigail, we were born with flat feet.
I say. Look over there.
Oh. Oh, how unusual.
Fancy that. A cat learning how to swim.
He's going about it all the wrong way.
Quite. We must correct him.
Sir. Sir?
You are most fortunate we happened along.
Yes. We're here to help you.
No, no. Back off, girls.
I'm doing fine.
First, you must gain self-confidence by striking out on your own.
Go away. I'm trying to get to shore.
You will never learn to swim properly with that willow branch in your mouth.
Indeed, not. Snip, snip.
Here we go.
Don't do that!
You're doing splendidly.
And don't worry about form.
It will come later.
Oh, he takes to water like a fish, doesn't he?
A very enthusiastic pupil!
No, no. This is no time for fun and games.
Gracious, Amelia.
- You don't suppose...
- Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
Bottoms up.
Deeper!
Look, Ma, there he is.
You really did quite well for a beginner.
Oh, Thomas. Thank goodness you're safe.
- Keep practising.
- And toodley-pip.
Can I help you, Mr. O'Malley, huh?
Help? I've had all the help I can take.
Oh, mademoiselles, thank you so much for helping Mr. O'Malley.
Of course, my dear.
But first, introductions.
Yes, we British like to keep things proper.
Now, I am Amelia Gabble and this is my sister...
- Miss Abigail Gabble.
- We're twin sisters.
You might say we're related.
How nice. I never would have guessed.
Look, they got rubber feet.
Yeah.
- We're on holiday.
- For a walking tour of France.
- Swimming some of the way.
- On water, of course.
Thomas, this is Amelia and Abigail Gabble.
Yeah, honey, get those two web-footed lifeguards out of here.
Now, now, Thomas.
OK, OK, baby.
Hiya, chicks.
How awful.
We're not chickens. We're geese.
Nooo. I thought you were swans.
Oh! Oh, flatterer.
Your husband is very charming and very handsome.
Well...
Uh, you see, I'm not exactly her husband.
Exactly? You either are or you're not.
All right. I'm not.
Oh?
Hm.
- It's scandalous.
- He's nothing but a cad.
Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate.
- A roué.
- His eyes are too close together.
- Shifty, too.
- Look at his crooked smile.
His chin is very weak, too.
Obviously, a philanderer who trifles with unsuspecting women's hearts.
How romantic.
Please, please, let me explain.
Thomas is a dear friend of ours.
- He's just helping us to get to...
- Come on, Duchess.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Well, girls, see you around.
- We're on our way to Paris.
- Oh, how nice.
- We're going to Paris ourselves.
- Why don't you join us?
I think that's a splendid idea.
Oh, no.
Now, uh, you stand here, dear.
And, uh, let's see.
You take this position.
- Duchess, you'll do nicely here.
- Very good.
And, you dear, you take this place.
Now, that leaves Mr. O'Malley.
We can't leave him, can we?
Mr. O'Malley, I think you should be the rear end.
Ready, everyone? Now, think goose.
Forward march.
Mama? Do we have to waddle like they do?
Yes, dear. Think goose.
When we get to Paris, you must meet Uncle Waldo.
Waldo?
Yes, he's our uncle.
We are to meet Uncle
Waldo at Le Petit Café.
Le Petit Café? Oh, that's that famous restaurant.
C'est magnifique.
Sacré bleu!
Oh, he bit my finger!
Get out. Go! Go, get out. Scram!
Good riddance!
Why! Why, it's Uncle Waldo.
Uncle Waldo!
Abigail! Amelia!
My two favourite nooses.
Uncle Waldo, I do believe you've been drinking.
Oh, dear. What happened to your lovely tail feathers?
Girls, it's outrageous.
Why, you won't believe what they tried to do to your poor old Uncle Waldo.
Look. Look at this.
"Prime country goose à la Provençale.
Stuffed with chestnuts"?
And "basted in... white wine".
Basted? He's been marinated in it.
Dreadful.
Being British, I would have preferred sherry.
Sherry! Sherry.
Oh! Oh, Uncle Waldo.
- You're just too much.
- You mean he's had too much.
- Abigail, Abigail.
- Yes, dear?
We'd best get Uncle Waldo to bed.
I say, there... what's all the whispering about, huh?
- Shh!
- Oh! Whoo-hoo!
Now, now, now, girls.
Girls, don't shush your old Uncle Waldo.
Why, you'll wake up the whole neighbourhood.
- Sh. No!
- Neighbourhood!
Come along, Uncle Waldo.
Oh, jeez, I think we'd better be going.
Oh. Right-o, girls.
Birds of a feather must... together.
That's "stick together".
Oh, stick.
Shush.
You know something?
I like Uncle Waldo.
Especially when he's marinated.
Frou-Frou, here comes Edgar.
Hurry, Roquefort, hop aboard the motorcycle.
And for goodness sakes, do be careful.
Frou-Frou, tonight Operation
Catnapper will be completed.
Wish me luck. Fisherman's luck.
Bye, Frou-Frou. Oooh!
I... Whoa!
Lafayette. Lafayette.
Listen.
Oh, shucks, Napoleon, that ain't nothin' but a little old cricket bug.
It's squeaky shoes approaching.
Oh, cricket bugs don't wear shoes.
Hush your mouth.
Let's see.
They're Oxford shoes.
Size nine and a half.
Hole in the left sole, it sounds like.
- What colour are they?
- They're black...
Now, how would I know that?
Hey! Now the squeaking has stopped.
I still say it was a little old cricket bug.
I'm the leader.
I'll decide what it was.
It was a little old cricket bug.
I'll see ya in the morning, Napoleon.
That's my hat. I'm the leader.
Well, shoot fire.
Don't get sore at me.
I ain't done nothin'.
Ooh. Oh.
Ooh.
Mm, mm. That feels good, Lafayette.
That's all right.
Mm. Mm.
Mm-mmm.
Oooh.
A little lower and faster there.
I'm scratching as fast as I can.
Oooh. Right there. That's good.
Oooh.
It's so warm... and cosy.
- Oooh.
- Aaah!
Oooh.
What's going on? Lafayette, what in tarnation you trying to do?
Aw, I get blamed for everything.
Wait a minute. Where's my hat?
What? And somebody stole my bumbershoot.
Where's my beddy-bye basket?
Whoever it is, is gonna get it and get it good.
This time I get the tender part.
Hush your mouth. Now, come on.
Hey, Napoleon, it's them shoes again.
Yeah, yeah, I hear 'em.
Napoleon, I'm plumb goose-pimply scared.
Now, this is no time to turn chicken.
I got a feelin' this case is gonna bust wide open.
Whoo-hoo!
Did you see him?
No, no, he sneaked up behind me and tailgated me.
Well, he didn't hurt me.
He hit me on the head.
Shh. Listen.
Sounds like a one-wheel...
- A one-wheel what?
- You're not gonna believe this.
But it's a one-wheeled haystack.
Hey, there it go. Come on.
After it!
I got him, I got him, I got him!
Ow! That's me.
Whoa, whoa. Oh!
Get him, get him.
Ooh. Ow.
Well, c'est la guerre, Napoleon.
I guess you can't win 'em all.
Ow. Oooh, oooh.
Criminently!
But, Thomas, Madame will be so worried.
Are you sure we can't get home tonight?
Mama, I'm tired.
Me, too, and my feet hurt.
Look, baby, it's late and the kids are bushed.
I'll bet we walked a hundred miles.
I'll bet it's more than a thousand.
Now, now, darlings, cheer up.
Mr. O'Malley knows a place where we can stay tonight.
How much farther is it, Mr. O'Malley?
Keep your whiskers up, tiger.
It's just beyond that next chimney pot.
Well, there it is.
My own penthouse pad.
It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's peaceful and quiet.
Oh! Oh, no.
Sounds like Scat Cat and his gang have dropped by.
- Oh, friends of yours?
- Yeah, they're old buddies, and they're real swingers.
"Schwingers"?
What is a "schwinger"?
You know, not exactly your type, Duchess.
Maybe we'd better find another place, huh?
Oh, no, no, no. I would like to see your pad and meet your Scat Cat.
Well, OK.
Hey, Scat Cat, blow some of that sweet stuff my way.
Well, lookie here.
Big man O'Malley's back in his alley.
Swing on down here, daddy.
Lay some skin on me, Scat Cat.
Yeah.
Buona sera, paesano.
Welcome home, O'Malley.
Duchess, this is the greatest cat of them all.
Oh, I'm delighted to meet you, Monsieur Scat Cat.
Likewise, Duchess.
You're too much.
You are charming.
And your music is so...
So different, so exciting.
It isn't Beethoven, Mama, but it sure bounces.
Say, this kitten-cat knows where it's at.
Knows where what's at?

I'll bet they're on that magic carpet right now.
They could hardly keep their eyes open.
Such an exciting day.
It sure was, and what a finale.
Thomas, your friends are really delightful.
I just love them.
Well, they're kinda rough, you know, around the edges, but if you're ever in a jam, wham, they're right there.
And wham, when we needed you, you were right there.
That was just a lucky break for me, baby.
Oh, and thank you so much for offering us your home.
Oh. I mean, your pad.
It's very nice.
Well, now, wait a minute.
This is the low-rent district, remember?
No, no, no, I like it.
Well, all it needs is a little tidying up, and maybe a little feminine touch.
Well, if you're applying for the job, well...
Goody. Mother's going to work for Mr. O'Malley.
Boy. Your eyes are like sapphires.
Gee.
That's pretty corny though, huh?
Oh, no. Not at all.
Any woman would like it.
I-I mean... even little Marie.
Yeah.
All those little kittens, Duchess.
I love 'em.
And they are very fond of you.
- Yeah.
- Shh.
You know, they need...
Well, you know, a sort...
Well, a sort of a...
Well, a father around.
Oh, Thomas, Thomas, that would be wonderful.
Darling, if only I could.
But why can't you?
Because of Madame.
I could never leave her.
But... But Madame's...
Well, she's just another human.
You're just her house pets.
Oh, no, no.
We mean far more to her than that.
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.
We just have to go home tomorrow.
Yeah.
Well, I guess you know best.
But I'm gonna miss you, baby.
And those kids...
Gee, I'm gonna miss them too.
Well, we almost had a father.
Yeah.
Let's go back to bed.
Good night, Duchess.
Good night, Thomas.
Hey.
Meow!
What a classy neighbourhood.
Dig these fancy wigwams.
Wigwams?
Are you sure we're on the right street?
Yes. Yes, let's hurry.
We're almost home.
Duchess! Kittens!
Hallelujah, they're back!
Oh, no. Edgar!
I've got to do something, quick.
Oh, ha.
Edgar, old chap, get used to the finer things in life.
Someday they're all going to be yours, you sly old fox.
Oh!
Oh, he got me.
Hooray! We're home.
Wait for me, wait for me!
Me first, me first!
- It's locked.
- Come on.
Let's all start meowing.
- It can't be them.
- The kittens.
Uh, why?
Don't come in!
Go away!
- Away!
- Look, there's Roquefort.
Hi, Roquefort!
He's glad to see us.
I don't know what to say.
I only wish that I...
Maybe just a short, sweet goodbye would be easiest.
I'll never forget you,
Thomas O'Malley.
Bye.
So long, baby.
Don't come in. Look out for Edgar!
Duchess, wherever have you been?
Look out for the... sack.
Well... guess they won't need me any more.
You came back?
It just isn't fair.
Edgar? Edgar, come quickly.
Coming, Madame, coming.
I'll take care of you later.
Oh, Edgar, they're back.
I heard them. Hurry, hurry, let them in.
Duchess? Kittens?
Come here, my darlings.
Where are you?
- Come on.
- Uh, allow me, Madame.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
His name is O... what?
His name is O'Malley. O'Malley.
Abraham de Lacy, Giuseppe Casey...
Oh, never mind. Just run, move, go get him!
Yes, yes, I'm on my way.
I told you it was Edgar.
Aw, shut up, Toulouse.
Oh, it's no use, Edgar.
I'm afraid it was just the imagination of an old lady.
But I was so sure that I heard them.
I'm so sorry, Madame.
Mr. O'Malley!
Hey, stop!
Duchess. Kittens. In trouble.
Butler did it.
Duchess and kittens in trouble?
Look, you go get Scat Cat and his gang of alley cats.
Alley cats?
But I'm a mouse.
Look, I'm gonna need help.
- You mean, you want me...?
- Move!
Just tell 'em O'Malley sent you, and you won't have a bit of trouble.
No trouble, he said.
Well, that's easy for... for what's-his-name to say.
He's got nine lives.
I've only got one.
What's a little swinger like you doing on our side of town?
Oh, please, I was sent here for help by a cat.
This is outrageous. It's crazy.
But honest! He told me just to mention his name.
So start mentioning name, rodent.
Oh, now, wait a minute, fellas.
Don't rush me.
His name is O'Toole.
I don't dig him. Strike one.
Oh, oh... O'Brien.
Strike two.
Oh, boy.
You believe me... don't you?
Keep talkin', mousey.
How about O...
Grady?
Huh?
Mousey, you just struck out.
Any last words?
Why did I listen to that O'Malley cat?
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?
- O'Malley?
- Hold it, cats.
This little guy's on the level.
You're darn tootin'
I'm on the level.
We didn't mean to ruffle you, squeaky.
Don't worry about me.
O'Malley needs help.
Duchess and kittens are in trouble.
Come on, cats, we gotta split.
Hey, wait for me!
You don't know the way!
Now, my little pesky pets, you're going to travel first class.
In your own private compartment.
All the way to Timbuktu.
And this time... you'll never come back.
Oh, no, we've got to hurry.
The baggage truck will be here any moment now.
Ooh!
Whoo-hoo. Oww!
Over there. They're in the trunk.
Quiet!
Everybody out of here, fast.
You are going to Timbuktu, if it's the last thing I do.
Well, Mac, this must be the trunk, eh?
Yup. And she goes all the way to Timbuktu.
Heave-ho.
Now, my pets, a little closer together.
Good. Good.
Look, Georges. What do you think?
Very good, very good.
But I think we should get on with the will.
Yes, yes, of course, but you know what to do.
Very well. Scratch one butler.
You know, Georges, if Edgar had only known about the will,
I'm sure he never would have left.
Duchess, it's wonderful to have you all back.
And I think this young man is very handsome.
Shall we keep him in the family?
Of course we will.
We need a man around the house.
And, Georges, we must be sure to provide for their future little ones.
Of course. The more the merrier.
Now, don't move.
Smile.
Say "cheese".
Did somebody say "cheese"?
Thank you.
Now, run along downstairs.
There's a surprise for you.
Adelaide, what's that music?
Sounds like a gang of swinging hepcats.
That's exactly what they are, Georges.
They're the start of my new foundation.
What foundation?
My home for all the alley cats of Paris.

SOLARIS
Part One
Kris, come here!
You're just in time.
He takes a walk every morning for at least an hour.
I forbade him to come back earlier.
He's had a lot of work, sometimes staying up all night.
These Solarists!
He reminds me of a bookkeeper, preparing his accounts.
We expected you yesterday.
He wanted to run away when he saw me.
Hello.
Hello.
I probably shouldn't have bothered you today.
How old you and I have become.
I've only just realized that.
What are you apologizing for?
Does he understand that everything depends on his first report from the station?
Everything we've received so far has been confusing or incomprehensible.
If he confirms that the work can't continue for some reason, the station can be taken out of Solaris' orbit.
He understands.
You promised to talk to him.
I brought the film.
That's what I came here for.
- Yes, of course.
Can the boy stay with you for a few days?
I have a lot to do and no one to leave him with.
Anna will look after him.
She'll have more free time now.
When does he leave?
He'll be gone by tomorrow morning.
It's so pleasant here.
This house reminds me of my grandfather's house.
I really liked it.
So we decided to build one just like it.
I don't like innovation.
I'd better get going.
I have a lot to do.
Don't you want to see this?
I've already seen it many times.
On the 21st day of our expedition,
radio-biologist Vishyakov and physicist Fekhner
went on an exploratory flight over the Solaris Ocean in a hydroplane.
When they failed to return after
16 hours, we declared an emergency.
The fog was thick and we were forced to call the search off.
All of the rescue craft returned to the station
except for the helicopter operated by Burton.
Burton returned an hour after dark.
Once out of the helicopter, he ran to his quarters.
He was in a state of shock.
This was highly unusual
for a man with 11 years of experience flying in space.
He recovered in a couple of days,
but he would never leave the station
and refused to approach the window overlooking the Ocean.
Later he wrote to us from the clinic.
He was preparing a statement of great importance,
one that would decide the fate of Solaristics.
Excellent.
Let's hear what he has to say.
At this time, let us give the floor to Burton.
Thank you.
When I first descended below 300 meters,
I had trouble maintaining altitude.
There was a strong wind.
All of my attention went towards operating the ship.
I did not look out of the cabin.
As a result, I wound up in a fog.
- Was it an ordinary fog?
Of course not.
It seemed to be colloidal and viscous.
It coated all of the windows.
Because of the fog's resistance,
I began to lose altitude.
I couldn't see the sun,
but the fog glowed red in its direction.
After half an hour
I came out into a large, open space.
It was almost round, a few hundred meters across.
At that point,
I noticed a change in the Ocean.
The waves disappeared.
The surface became almost transparent, with clouded patches.
Yellow sludge gathered beneath it.
It rose up in thin strips and sparkled like glass.
Then it began to seethe, boil and harden.
It looked like molasses.
This sludge or slime gathered into large lumps
and slowly formed different shapes.
I was being drawn into the fog,
so I had to struggle against this for some time.
When I looked down again,
I saw a sort of garden.
A garden?
Attention, please.
I saw shrubs, hedges, acacia trees, little paths.
Everything was made of the same substance.
Did these trees and plants have leaves?
These shrubs and acacias?
No, I already said they were all made of plaster, but life-sized.
Then everything began to crack and break.
Yellow sludge poured out of the fissures.
Everything began to boil even harder, and foam appeared.
You can see for yourselves.
I used a camera from time to time.
Everything I saw before and after should be on film.
Then I propose we interrupt these discussions
and see everything with our own eyes.
All right, show us your film.
This is very interesting.
Is that it?
That's all of your film?
Yes, that's everything.
But we don't understand.
You filmed clouds.
Why did you film clouds?
That must be the fog
I told you about.
I wasn't expecting this.
All of this could be the result of Solaris' bio-magnetic current
acting on Burton's consciousness.
We now know the current is not only a gigantic cerebral system,
but a substance capable of thought processes.
That hypothesis is questionable.
Were you feeling sick that day?
The next part is meaningless.
Let's pick up here.
I discovered something floating in one of the openings.
It looked like Fechner's space suit.
Its shape was that of a person.
I turned around-
I didn't want to lose sight of that spot.
At that moment, the figure rose slightly,
as if it were swimming or treading the waves.
This person had no space suit, and he was moving.
I don't understand. "Person"?
Yes, person.
Just a minute.
Did you see his face?
Yes.
What person?
Who was it?
It was a child.
What child?
Had you seen him before?
No, never.
In any case, not that I remember.
When I flew closer to him,
I noticed something awful.
What do you mean?
I couldn't make it out at first.
Then I saw that he was unusually large. Gigantic.
He was about four meters tall.
He had blue eyes
and dark hair.
Perhaps you're not feeling well?
We'll postpone the meeting.
I'll continue.
He was naked, absolutely naked,
like a newborn.
He was wet, or rather, slippery.
His skin was shiny.
He rose and fell like the waves, but he was moving by himself.
It was disgusting.
I'm sorry.
I'll jump ahead a little.
There isn't much more.
Burton's statements appear to be the result of a hallucinatory complex
brought on by the planet's atmosphere,
as well as symptoms of depression
exacerbated by inflammation of the associative zone
of the cerebral cortex.
This report in no way, or in almost no way,
corresponds with reality.
What do you mean "almost"?
Excuse me, I'm not finished yet.
Professor Messenger offers a different opinion.
He believes that Burton's statements could be founded in reality
and merit further study.
That's it.
I saw it all with my own eyes.
I would like to offer another opinion.
We stand on the brink of an enormous discovery,
Our decision should not rely on the observations
of a man without any scientific qualifications.
Although any researcher may envy this pilot,
his presence of mind, his gift of observation.
Moreover, in light of recent information,
we are morally obligated to continue the exploration.
I can understand how Professor Messenger feels.
I understand him.
But let's take a look at the road we've traveled.
Solaristics is exactly where it began.
Years of work have been in vain.
Everything we now know about Solaris is negative
and has come to resemble a mountain of disjointed, incoherent facts
that strain credulity.
We're in exactly the same situation today.
Solaristics is degenerating.
But what we're talking about is far more serious
than just the study of Solaristics.
We're talking about the boundaries of human knowledge.
Don't you think that by establishing artificial barriers
we deliver a blow to the idea of limitless thought?
By limiting our movement forward, we facilitate moving backwards.
I nevertheless repeat my question.
What do you mean by saying
the report of my observations in almost no way corresponds with reality?
I saw everything with my own eyes.
What do you mean by "almost"?
"Almost no way" means that some real phenomena
could have triggered your hallucinations, Burton.
When it's windy,
it's easy to confuse a swaying bush with a living being,
to say nothing of a foreign planet.
I meant no offense, Burton.
None.
I'd like to know what impact
Professor Messenger's opinion will have.
Practically none,
which means that exploration in this area will be discontinued.
Just a moment. Yes...
I'd like to make a statement.
The commission has not offended me,
but it has offended the spirit of the expedition.
Therefore, I consider it my duty to announce...
And so on...
Nowadays it's considered good manners to laugh when Burton's report is mentioned.
Thank you, Burton.
We've known you for a long time, but I never knew anything about you.
You know, you were very handsome.
That's not true, but thanks anyway.
Excuse me.
Well, Kris, what do you think?
If you don't mind,
I'd like to speak to your son alone.
I don't want to look like an idiot in front of you yet again.
I'll wait for you outside by the swing.
What a ridiculous man.
You have no reason to say that.
He's ill at ease.
He thinks he's getting in the way of our farewell.
He's a tactful man.
If he decided to come, it's because he considers this important.
Although, I admit,
I'd rather not see anyone now.
You and I rarely get a chance to talk.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
Even if it's on the last day.
The last day.
One always feels awful after a big farewell.
Here comes your aunt.
Let's meet after lunch.
We need to talk.
Why did you have to invite this Burton today of all days?
Where are the guests going to sleep?
Next to you, or in the room upstairs?
Upstairs, I guess.
Well, I'm off to my meeting by the swing.
- Maybe...
- Just a moment.
You and your rooms can wait!
Listen, Kris...
What happened?
- What's standing over there?
- What are you afraid of?
In the garage, staring at me.
It's a horse.
Don't. I've seen it already.
Come on.
He's gentle.
Look how beautiful he is.
You understand, I think
Solaristics has reached an impasse as a result of irresponsible daydreaming.
I'm interested in the truth, but you want to turn me into a biased supporter.
I don't have the right to make decisions based on impulses of the heart.
I'm not a poet.
I have a concrete goal:
Either stop the research and remove the station from orbit, thereby legitimizing the Solaristics crisis, or take extreme measures.
Perhaps bombard the Ocean with heavy radiation.
- Not that!
- Why not?
Didn't you say research should continue at any price?
You want to destroy that which we are presently incapable of understanding?
Forgive me, but I am not an advocate of knowledge at any price.
Knowledge is only valid when it's based on morality.
Man is the one who renders science moral or immoral.
Remember Hiroshima.
Then don't make science immoral.
It's strange...
Strange.
There's nothing strange about it.
You yourself can't be sure that what you saw wasn't just hallucinations.
Thank you very much.
It's seems there's nothing more to discuss.
- What happened?
- I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
He's an accountant, not a scientist.
You were right.
You and I are friends, but that doesn't mean you can say that about him.
Great. You and I have known each other for 20 years. It had to end someday.
Are you leaving the boy?
What did you have to offend him for?
You're too harsh.
It's dangerous to send people like you into space.
Everything there is too fragile.
Yes, fragile!
The Earth has somehow become adjusted to people like you, although at what sacrifice!
What, are you jealous that he'll be the one to bury me, and not you?
Thus, it had been established that the Solaris Ocean is a distinctive brain.
Right after that, an even more daring hypothesis came out,
suggesting that the Ocean is a thinking substance.
Incidentally, this hypothesis
still cannot be confirmed or refuted.
It's a program about Solaris.
There are few believers left.
First of all, there are those connected to the fate of the Solaris station.
On this huge station built to house 85 people
there is now a crew of three.
They are: astro-biologist Sartorius,
cyberneticist Snaut,
and physiologist Gibarian, who deal with the problem...
I'm calling from the city.
Burton.
Anna, leave for a minute.
We need to talk.
I didn't talk to Kris about what was most important:
about Messenger, who voiced a different opinion at that meeting.
He became very interested in Fechner, who died in the Solaris Ocean.
It turns out that Fechner has an orphaned son.
He had left his family.
Messenger and I paid a visit to Fechner's widow,
and I saw this boy with my own eyes.
You never told me about that.
I never got the chance.
Fine. Go on.
This child was identical to the one I saw on Solaris.
Of course, he wasn't four meters tall.
He shouldn't think about this too much before liftoff,
but he should keep it in mind.
There's no point in keeping these papers.
The ones to hold on to are in my room.
My research notes, my thesis...
I held on to so much.
If something should happen,
I'll find someone to take care of them.
I'll come up with something.
Don't look for that film.
I'm taking it with me.
Remember?
The one of the bonfire?
Yes, of course.
- Ready, Kelvin?
- Ready, Moddard.
Don't worry about a thing.
Have a great trip.
Send our regards.
- When is liftoff?
- You're already flying, Kris! Take care.
Solaris station! Do something!
I'm losing stability.
This is Kelvin, over.
Hey, where is everyone?
You've got guests.
Dr. Snaut?
Snaut?
I'm Kelvin, the psychologist.
It looks like you weren't expecting me.
Did you receive the radiogram?
Yes, of course.
What's with you?
Forgive me.
Where's Gibarian?
Where's Sartorius?
Sartorius is in his quarters.
Gibarian is dead.
What do you mean "dead"?
Suicide.
I beg your pardon.
I knew Gibarian and he would never have...
He was almost always in a state of deep depression ever since these disturbances began...
Why don't you go rest, take a bath?
Take any room and come back in an hour.
I would like to see Gibarian -
I mean, Sartorius.
Later.
I doubt he'd see you now.
He's upstairs, in the laboratory.
Listen, Snaut,
I understand that something extraordinary has happened and maybe...
Dr. Kelvin...
You understand...
Come back in an hour. Please.
Go and rest.
Listen, there are only three of us: you, me and Sartorius.
You know us from our photographs.
If you see something out of the ordinary, something besides me and Sartorius, try not to lose your head.
What would I see?
I don't know.
That sort of depends on you.
Hallucinations?
No. Just remember.
- Remember what?
- That we're not on Earth.
You know, it would be better if you came back in the evening, or at night.
No, let's make it tomorrow morning.
A. GIBARIAN
HUMAN BEING
FOR K. KELVIN
Hi, Kris.
I still have a little time left.
There are some things
I must tell you,
and some things
I must warn you about.
By now you're at the station and know what happened to me.
If not, Snaut or Sartorius will tell you.
What happened to me...
is not important.
Or rather, it cannot be explained.
I'm afraid that what happened to me is only the beginning.
I wouldn't, of course, want it to happen...
but this could happen to you and the others.
Here, it could probably happen to anyone.
Just don't think that I've lost my mind.
I'm of sound mind, Kris.
Believe me.
After all, you know me.
If I have enough time,
I'll tell you why I did everything.
I'm telling you this so that, if it does happen to you,
you'll know it's not madness.
That's the most important thing.
As for continuing research,
I'm leaning towards
Sartorius' proposal,
subjecting the Ocean's plasma to heavy radiation.
I know it's prohibited, but there's no other choice.
We...
You will get mired in it.
It may offer a way of breaking this deadlock.
This is our only chance to make contact with this monster.
There is no other choice, Kris.
If...
Dr. Sartorius, I am Kelvin.
I arrived two hours ago.
Listen, this is ridiculous.
Either open up or I'll break down the door.
All right, I'll open the door, but don't come in.
I'll come out.
- Fine.
My name is Kelvin.
Go on.
You must have heard of me.
I work, or worked, with Gibarian.
Go on.
Snaut told me about Gibarian.
Then you already know the story.
Yes, it's horrible.
I don't know the details, but he's dead.
That's not the problem.
We all die.
But he insisted on being buried on Earth.
Is space really such a bad grave for him?
But Gibarian wanted to be in the ground, with the worms.
I wanted to disregard it, but Snaut insisted.
- Have you ever heard of Burton?
- He was the pilot who...
Yes, he was in the search party for Fechner.
Fechner died a magnificent death, but Gibarian was a coward.
There's no point talking badly of him now.
It's at least worth talking about duty.
Duty to whom?
- To truth.
- You mean to people.
You won't find truth there. Look.
Your position is absurd.
Your so-called courage is inhuman!
You hear me?
Go away.
You're too impressionable.
You must get used to everything.
Good day.
I spoke to Sartorius.
He's a rotten person.
He's a very talented scientist.
I think I'm a little sick.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You just won't take advice.
Snaut, aside from the three of us, is there anyone else on the station?
Did you see someone?
What were you warning me about?
Whom did you see?
Was it a human being?
Is she real?
Can she be touched? Wounded?
You saw her today.
And you?
Who the hell are you?
Quiet.
- Where did she come from?
- Leave me alone.
You're afraid.
Don't worry.
I won't think you're insane.
Insane?
God, you know absolutely nothing!
Insane...
That would be a blessing.
Listen, Snaut...
It's all so senseless.
They won't understand me.
They think I've gone crazy.
Do you see, Kris, how it's not entirely absurd?
I have to do this because
I'm afraid they'll come in here.
I mean Snaut and Sartorius.
They themselves don't understand what they're doing.
I'm afraid, Kris...
I can't...
Nobody will be able to understand.
Open up! You hear, Gibarian?
Open up!
Don't be stupid.
It's just us - Snaut and Sartorius.
We want to help you.
They want to help me.
Just a second. Quit knocking.
I am my own judge.
Have you seen her?
Kris, understand that this is not madness.
It has something to do with conscience.
I really wanted you to get here in time, Kris.
Where did you?
It's so nice.
But... but it's not...
How did you know where I?
What do you mean, "how"?
Don't, Kris. That tickles.
Where are my shoes?
- Shoes?
No. They're not there.
Who's this?
Kris... it's me.
You know...
I have the feeling... as if I've forgotten something.
I can't understand it.
Do you love me?
Don't be silly, Hari.
As if you didn't know.
I'm going out for a moment.
Wait for me, okay?
- I'll go with you.
- No, Hari. I'll be back soon.
No.
What's with you? Why?
I don't know. I can't.
You can't what?
It feels like I...
I have to see you... all the time.
What are you, a child?
I have work to do, Hari.
I'm behaving foolishly.
And so are you.
Running around all disheveled, like Snaut.
- Like who?
- Like Snaut.
Listen, how do you...
Well, I have to go.
If you want, we can go together.
But you won't be able to get into a suit with your dress on.
Get undressed.
Kris, help me. I can't undo it.
Why are you looking at me like that?
SOLARIS
Part Two
Get in.
- What about you?
- I'm right behind you.
I have to shut the hatch.
Is everything all right?
Are you comfortable?
Yes. Hurry, Kris.
You could at least knock.
It sounded like you were talking to someone.
All the more reason.
So you had guests?
Well, I see you took good care of them.
It's nothing.
You won't die from it.
Did you at least start out modestly?
Narcotics, poisons, barbiturates, eh?
If you plan to clown around, you might as well leave.
Sometimes you become a clown without wanting to.
Don't tell me you haven't tried a rope or a hammer.
Did you happen to throw the inkwell like Luther? No?
So, one, two, and into the rocket, and that was that.
Next time, don't panic.
And push the button from the corridor.
You could get burned.
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Then again, we've managed to determine a few things.
Who was it?
She died 10 years ago.
What you saw was the materialization of your conception of her.
What was her name?
- Hari.
Everything began after we started experimenting with radiation.
We hit the Ocean's surface with strong X-ray beams.
But it...
Incidentally, consider yourself lucky.
After all, she's a part of your past.
What if it had been something you had never seen before, but something you had thought or imagined?
I don't understand.
Evidently the Ocean responded to our heavy radiation with something else.
It probed our minds and extracted something like islands of memory.
Will she come back?
She will... and she won't.
- Hari the Second.
- There may be an endless number of them.
Why didn't you warn me?
You wouldn't have believed me.
I got scared and acted not entirely...
Don't be hard on yourself.
We've had enough of Gibarian.
There's talk about liquidating the station.
That's why I was sent here.
If I submit a report, will you sign it?
And what if we suddenly make that long-awaited contact?
Night is the best time here.
It somehow reminds me of Earth.
Attach strips of paper to the air-vents.
At night it sounds like the rustling of leaves.
It was Gibarian's invention.
So simple, like all genius.
I adopted it right away.
Sartorius made fun of us, but he has one in his room.
He hides it in the closet.
You should rest.
If you can, come to the library later.
I've prepared a list of books for you.
Snaut, is that you?
Kris, where are you?
Come here.
- It's so dark.
- Come here. Don't be afraid.
Hari!
The door opens the other way.
Hang on.
I'll be right back.
When I saw you weren't there,
I got scared.
Hello, Kris.
I can barely hear you.
Speak louder.
What are you doing right now?
Nothing.
Sartorius has invited us to his laboratory.
How are you?
Fine. I'll try to make it.
Kris, what's wrong with me?
Maybe it's epilepsy?
This is my wife.
Hello.
Hello.
- We've been waiting for you.
- I was busy.
- How lovely! Are these yours?
- No, they're Snaut's.
So, as far as I can tell, they are constructed...
Let's just call them "guests."
Fine.
While our structure is made of atoms, theirs consists of neutrinos.
But neutrino systems are unstable.
They seem to be stabilized by Solaris' force field.
You've got a superb specimen.
That's my wife.
Wonderful. Perfect.
Then take a blood sample from your wife.
Why?
It'll sober you up a bit.
What do you think?
- Snaut?
- Enough of all of you!
I burned the blood with acid, but it's restoring itself.
Regeneration?
In essence, immortality-
Faust's problem.
Excuse me.
There's no need for cotton.
Are you qualified to perform an autopsy?
I've already told you -she's my wife.
Don't you understand?
I think these experiments are more humane than testing on rabbits.
Don't you agree?
It doesn't matter.
It would be like cutting my own leg off.
Did you feel pain when you broke through the door?
Pain? Of course.
So if I ever catch you doing anything...
- You're lucky.
- How so?
It's meaningless, yet you've managed to establish emotional contact with them.
It may be pleasant...
- What are you, jealous?
Maybe I'm jealous.
No, you're not jealous.
After all, you're not guilty of anything.
- Of course.
- But I am guilty.
Of what?
When you turn into an utter cripple with no arms or legs, call us.
We'll empty your chamber pot.
- But whom have you wronged?
- You, among others.
My father shot that.
Well, I shot a bit.
Listen...
I don't know myself at all.
I don't remember.
When I close my eyes,
I can't recall my face. And you?
What?
- Do you know yourself?
- Like all humans.
That woman in the white coat hated me.
Don't make things up.
She died before you and I met.
I don't understand why you're deceiving me.
I remember perfectly.
We drank tea and she kicked me out.
Naturally, I stood up and left.
I remember perfectly.
What happened after that?
After that, I went away, and we never saw each other again.
Where did you go?
To a different city.
- Why?
- I was transferred.
Why did you leave without me?
You didn't want to come.
That I remember.
Forgive me.
I thought you were already awake.
What happened?
The regeneration is slowing down.
For two or three hours we can be free of them.
You came in the middle of the night to tell me that?
I'll tell you why I came.
Sartorius and I were thinking:
If the Ocean derives guests from us while we dream, maybe it makes sense to transmit our waking thoughts to it.
- How?
- With beams of radiation.
Perhaps it will understand and spare us from all these apparitions.
Again these ridiculous X-ray sermons about the greatness of science?
We'll modulate the beam with the brain waves of one of us.
And "one of us" means me, of course.
An encephalogram!
A transcription of all my thoughts!
What if I suddenly want her to die?
To disappear!
Entrust everything to that... that mass of jelly?
It's already invaded my soul.
Kris, we're running out of time.
Sartorius has proposed another project: the annihilator.
Self-destruction of the neutrino systems.
What is this? Blackmail?
I convinced him to start with the encephalogram.
But forget about this for now.
Tomorrow's my birthday.
Consider yourself invited.
- Liar! You just want to make up with us.
- Yes, I do.
Don't shout. She sleeping.
Sleeping?
She's already learned how to sleep?
This will all end badly.
- Well, what do you propose I do?
- Nothing.
So you'll come?
Tomorrow, in the library.
We'll set the table.
At least there are no windows in there.
In the meantime, let's go.
Sartorius is waiting.
She's sleeping.
Will she follow me?
Don't lock the door.
What door?
It's just an apparition.
Wait. I'll be right back.
Where are you going?
Forgive me.
Why aren't you asleep?
- You don't love me.
- Stop it, Hari.
- We have to talk.
- About what?
You understand that I don't know where I came from.
Maybe you know?
- What's with you?
Stop. Don't interrupt.
If you know, but you can't tell me now, perhaps one day you will.
What are you talking about?
I don't understand a thing, honestly.
You don't want to tell me.
You're afraid.
Then I'll tell you.
I'm not Hari.
Hari is dead.
She poisoned herself.
I'm somebody else.
Who told you this?
- Sartorius just told me.
- Last night.
It would have been better if you had told me yourself.
My God, what's the difference?
How have you lived all this time?
Were you in love with anyone?
I don't know.
Did you ever think of me?
Yes, but not all the time.
Only when I felt unhappy.
You know, it feels like somebody is tricking us.
And the longer this fog lasts, the worse it will be for you in the end.
Particularly for you, Kris.
How can I help you?
Tell me.
And her, the other one, what happened to her?
We argued.
Towards the end, we argued a lot.
I gathered my things and left.
She made me understand without saying it directly, but when you live with someone for a long time, such things aren't necessary.
I was sure they were just words, but then I remembered that I'd left the laboratory specimens in the refrigerator.
I had brought them from the laboratory and explained how they worked.
I got scared.
I wanted to go to her.
But then I thought it would look like
I had taken her words seriously.
After three days, I couldn't take it anymore and I went to see her.
When I got there, she was already dead.
There was a needle mark on her arm.
Like this?
Why did she do it?
She probably sensed that I didn't really love her.
But now I do.
- Kris.
- What?
I love you.
Get some sleep.
I don't know how to sleep.
It's not sleep.
It's somehow around me.
It's as if it weren't just inside of me, but much farther away.
It's probably still sleep.
So, it looks like our guest of honor isn't showing up.
- Why?
- Maybe he has guests.
Oh, everyone's already here?
You're an hour and a half late.
What's that you're reading?
It's all rubbish.
Rubbish.
Where the hell is...
Here!
"They come at night.
But one must sleep sometime."
That's the problem.
Mankind has lost the ability to sleep.
You'd better read.
I'm a little excited.
"I know only one thing, señor.
When I...
When I sleep, I know no fear, no hope, no trouble, no bliss.
Blessings on him who invented sleep.
The common coin that purchases all things, the balance that levels shepherd and king, fool and wise man.
There is only one bad thing about sound sleep.
They say it closely resembles death."
"Never before, Sancho, have I heard you speak so elegantly as now."
That's great, but perhaps you'll let me say something now?
I propose a toast to Snaut, to his bravery, to his devotion to duty.
To science and to Snaut.
Science? Nonsense.
In this situation, mediocrity and genius are equally useless.
We have no interest in conquering any cosmos.
We want to extend the Earth to the borders of the cosmos.
We don't know what to do with other worlds.
We don't need other worlds.
We need a mirror.
We struggle for contact, but we'll never find it.
We're in the foolish human predicament of striving for a goal that he fears, that he has no need for.
Man needs man.
Let's drink to Gibarian.
To his memory.
Even though he got frightened.
No, Gibarian was not frightened.
There are worse things.
He died of hopelessness.
He thought all this was happening only to him.
My God!
All these heartbreaking lamentations are nothing but second-rate Dostoyevsky.
Who are you to judge?
I know why I'm here.
I'm working.
Man was created by nature so he could learn her ways.
In his endless search for the truth, man is condemned to knowledge.
Everything else is whim.
Permit me to ask, my esteemed colleague:
Why have you come to Solaris?
- What do you mean, why?
- Well, are you working a lot?
Forgive me, but aside from the romance with your ex-wife, nothing seems to interest you.
You spend all day lounging in a bed of noble thoughts, and that's how you carry out your duty.
You've lost touch with reality.
Forgive me, but you're simply a loafer.
Enough!
Let's try to be pleasant.
We'll drink to Gibarian.
Not to Gibarian, but to Man.
Are you saying
Gibarian was not a man?
Stop it, Kris.
Let's not fight.
After all, it's my birthday.
It's my day.
Of course.
I think that Kris Kelvin is more consistent than both of you.
In inhuman conditions, he has behaved humanely.
And you act as if none of this concerns you, and consider your guests - it seems that's what you call us - something external, a hindrance.
But it's a part of you.
It's your conscience.
And Kris loves me.
Maybe it's not me he loves, but he's simply protecting himself.
He wants me alive.
That's not the point.
It doesn't matter why man loves.
It's different for everyone.
It's not Kris.
It's you.
I hate you all.
- I would ask you...
Please don't interrupt me.
I'm a woman, after all.
You're not a woman and you're not a human being.
Understand that, if you're capable of understanding anything.
There is no Hari. She's dead.
You're just a reproduction, a mechanical reproduction.
A copy. A matrix.
Yes.
Maybe.
But I...
I am becoming a human being.
I can feel just as deeply as you.
Believe me.
I can already get by without him.
I... love him.
I am a human being.
You... you're very cruel.
Get up! Get up right now!
My dear man.
Nothing could be easier.
We've wasted time arguing.
We're losing our dignity and human character.
No.
You're human, each in your own way.
That's why you argue.
I hope I'm not bothering you.
You're a good man... but you look awful.
I've really lost heart.
Help me out a bit.
Doesn't a man who's ready to give up his life just to make cursed contact in order to know more about it have the right to get drunk?
He has every right.
Do you believe in our mission, Kelvin?
I'm not going to bed yet.
It's important not to fall asleep.
I'm going to see Faust.
In the laboratory, our Faust-
Sartorius - is seeking a remedy for immortality.
While we...
Listen, let's open these hatches and shout down below.
It would suddenly hear.
But what should we call it?
Maybe we should whip it.
Or, better yet, pray to it.
What's wrong?
I think I shut the door to the library.
She's there alone.
Go. I feel better already.
The station is changing its orbit.
At 5 a.m. there will be
30 seconds of weightlessness.
Don't forget.
Forgive me, my darling.
I was lost in thought.
Is something wrong?
No, nothing.
Everything's fine.
She drank liquid oxygen.
She did it out of despair.
It'll get worse.
The more she's with you, the more human she'll become.
Learn from Sartorius' example.
- Thanks for the advice.
What do you intend to do?
Wait until she returns.
And then what?
Leave the station?
Kris, she can only live here, on the station. You know that.
What can I do?
I love her.
- Which one?
Her, or the one in the rocket?
You can pull her in from space.
She will appear again and she'll keep appearing.
Don't turn a scientific problem into a common love story.
I had a feeling this would end badly.
You should help her.
What a ghastly sight.
I can never get used to all these resurrections.
Is it me?
Hari...
What?
Why?
Why?
No, it's not me.
It's... I'm... not Hari...
And you... Maybe you...
- Don't, Hari.
- I'm not Hari!
Fine!
Maybe your appearance is supposed to be torture.
Maybe it's a favor from the Ocean.
What does it matter when you're worth more to me than any science could ever be?
Do I look a lot like her?
No, you looked like her.
But now you -and not her- are the real Hari.
Tell me...
Do I disgust you? I'm so...
I disgust you!
- No, Hari. That's not true.
- You're lying!
- It's not true. Stop it.
- I must be disgusting!
- Stop it.
Don't touch me!
I love you.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm not going back to Earth.
I'll live here with you on the station.
You know...
I'm afraid.
It looks like it's showing some activity.
Your encephalogram helped.
You know... whenever we show pity, we ravage ourselves.
Maybe it's true...
Suffering makes life seem dismal and suspect.
But I won't accept that.
No, I won't accept that.
Is that which is indispensable to life also harmful to it?
No, it's not harmful.
Of course it's not harmful.
Remember Tolstoy?
His suffering over the impossibility of loving mankind as a whole?
How much time has passed since then?
Somehow I can't figure it out.
Help me.
See, I love you.
But love is a feeling we can experience but never explain.
One can explain the concept.
You love that which you can lose:
Yourself, a woman, a homeland.
Until today, love was simply unattainable to mankind, to the Earth.
Do you understand me, Snaut?
There are so few of us.
A few billion altogether. A handful!
Maybe we're here in order to experience people as a reason for love.
He seems to have a fever.
How did Gibarian die?
You still haven't told me.
I'll tell you. Later.
Gibarian didn't die of fear.
He died of shame.
Shame-the feeling that will save mankind.
Mama, I...
I'm two hours late.
I know.
How was your trip?
Fine. I'm a little tired, but it was fine.
My God, it's running slow again.
I'll go adjust it.
You've got plenty of time.
You know, it's really embarrassing, but for some reason...
I've completely forgotten your face.
You don't look well.
Are you happy?
Somehow that concept seems irrelevant here.
That's really a pity.
I'm very lonesome now.
Why do you hurt our feelings?
What have you been waiting for?
Why haven't you called?
You're leading some sort of strange life.
You're filthy and unkempt.
How did you make such a mess of yourself?
What's this?
Wait here. I'll be right back.
How are you?
Everything all right?
Where's Hari?
What's that?
There's no more Hari.
"Kris, it's terrible that I had to deceive you, but there was no other way.
This is best for both of us.
I asked them myself.
You mustn't blame anyone.
Hari."
She did it for you.
Snaut, listen.
Later, Kris. Calm down.
How... how did it...
The annihilator?
A burst of light and wind.
Yes.
Things weren't working out between us towards the end.
Listen, Snaut.
Why are we being tortured like this?
In my opinion, we have lost our sense of the cosmic.
The ancients understood it perfectly.
They never would have asked why or what for.
Remember the myth of Sisyphus.
Since we transmitted your encephalogram, none of the guests have come back.
Something incomprehensible is starting to take place in the Ocean.
Islands have begun to form on the surface.
First one. Then the next day there were several more.
Are you trying to tell me that it understood us?
That quickly?
But at least there's hope, eh, Kris?
- How old are you?
- Fifty-two. Why?
Have you been here long?
- You must have seen my forms.
- I did.
Listen, having spent so many years here on the station, do you still feel a clear connection to your life down there?
You like dire questions.
Soon you'll ask me about the meaning of life.
Wait. Don't be ironic.
It's a banal question.
When man is happy, the meaning of life and other eternal themes rarely interest him.
These questions should be asked at the end of one's life.
But we don't know when life will end.
That's why we're in such a hurry.
Don't rush.
The happiest people are those who are not interested in these cursed questions.
To ask is always the desire to know.
Yet the preservation of simple human truths requires mystery.
The mysteries of happiness, death and love.
Maybe you're right, but try not to think about all that now.
To think about it is to know the day of one's death.
Not knowing that day makes us practically immortal.
Fine, then.
In any event, my mission is finished.
But what next?
Return to Earth?
Little by little, everything will return to normal.
I'll even find new interests and acquaintances.
But I won't be able to give myself to them fully.
Never.
Do I have the right to turn down
even an imagined possibility of contact with this Ocean
which my race has been trying to understand for decades?
Should I remain here?
Among things and objects we both touched?
Which still bear the memory of our breath?
What for?
In the hope that she'll return?
But I don't harbor this hope.
The only thing left for me
is to wait.
I don't know what for.
New miracles?
Are you tired?
No, I feel great.
You know, Kris...
I think it's time you returned to Earth.
You think so?
THE END
Long ago...
... in the early years of the Second Age...
... the great Elven-smiths
forged Rings of Power.
Nine for mortal Men.
Seven for the Dwarf-lords.
Three for the tall Elf-kings.
But then, the Dark Lord learned
the craft of ring-making...
... and made the Master Ring.
The One Ring to rule them all.
With the One Ring, Middle-earth is his
and he cannot be overcome.
As the last alliance of Men and Elves
fell beneath his power...
... he did not notice the heroic shadow
who slipped in.
It was Prince Isildur...
... of the mighty kings from across the sea...
... who took the Ring.
But because he did not destroy it,
the spirit of the Dark Lord lived on...
... and began to take shape and grow again.
But the Ring had a will of its own,
and a way of slipping from one hand...
... to be found by another, so that it
might at last get back to its master.
And there the Ring lay,
at the bottom of the Great River Anduin...
... for thousands of years.
During those years...
... the Dark Lord captured the nine Rings
that were made for Men...
... and turned their owners
into the Ringwraiths:
Terrible shadows under his great shadow...
... who roamed the world,
searching for the One Ring.
In time, the Ring was found.
Two friends were fishing
in the Great River one day.
- Give us that, Déagol, my love.
- Why, Sméagol?
Because it's my birthday, my love, and I wants it.
I have already given you more than I could afford.
I found this, and I'm going to keep it!
Are you indeed, my love?
He used the Ring for thieving,
and to find out secrets.
His own people began to despise
the wretched creature...
... and to call him Gollum.
Tortured and driven by the Ring,
he hid in dark caves...
... under deep mountains.
But the Ring
slipped off Gollum's finger, too.
And so it was that Bilbo found it,
during his travels with the Dwarves.
Thief, Baggins. Thief!
It stole our precious, our precious...
Our birthday present.
Thief, Baggins! We hates it forever!
It was Bilbo Baggins, the Hobbit...
... who took the Ring back to the Shire,
his home.
Years later...
... Gandalf the Wizard, visited Bilbo
on his going-away birthday party.
I don't know half of you half as well as I should like...
...and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
Frodo, I can see your uncle Bilbo hasn't changed much.
And though 111 years is far too short a time...
...to live among such admirable Bagginses and Boffinses, Grubbs...
...Chubbs, Brace-girdles, Goodbodies...
...Bolgers, Hornblowers and Proudfoots...
- Proudfeet!
...I regret to announce that this is the end.
I'm going away. I'm leaving. Now.
Goodbye.
Where did he go?
Oh, Gandalf.
Have you left the Ring for Frodo, as we agreed?
It's mine, I tell you! It's my own.
My precious!
It's mine now, and I shall keep it.
I won't give my precious away, I tell you.
Do not say that again!
Give it to Frodo, and I will look after him.
All right, I will.
Seventeen years passed sleepily
in the Shire.
All right, just a minute!
Gandalf!
Greetings, Frodo.
Gandalf, it's really you!
Oh, it's been so long!
Seventeen years...
...since Bilbo left.
You look the same as ever, Frodo.
You look older, Gandalf.
Oh, I've been on a long journey.
It's the Ring, isn't it?
Bilbo's funny magic ring.
You always used to look like that when you talked about it.
Bilbo's "funny" ring, that makes you invisible?
- Give it to me, Frodo!
- Give you the Ring?
For a moment only.
Can you see any markings on it?
There are none.
It's quite a plain ring, really.
Well, then, look!
Wait. Do you desire it so much already?
No, but why ruin it?
Because it is altogether evil.
It will corrupt and destroy anyone who wears it...
...until he passes into the World of Shadows...
...under the power of Sauron:
The Dark Lord of Mordor!
Not Bilbo?
You are the one who has the Ring now.
- It's not even warm.
- No.
Not even a dragon's fire could harm that Ring.
"One Ring to rule them all
"One Ring to find them
"One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them"
I wish it need not have happened in my time.
So do I.
The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength of knowledge...
...to break all resistance, and cover all the lands in darkness.
He lacks the One Ring.
Maybe he doesn't know that it was found.
He knows, Frodo.
Gollum left his cave to follow the Ring himself...
...and the Dark Lord caught him in Mordor.
The Dark Lord knows what ring it was
Gollum found, and how he lost it again.
And he has heard of Hobbits at last, and of the Shire.
And he even has a name to think about...
...the name of Baggins.
Because of Gollum!
Oh, Gandalf, what am I to do?
What a pity that Bilbo didn't kill that vile creature when he had the chance!
Yes, it was pity.
Pity and mercy.
And now, Frodo, the decision lies with you.
What will you do with the One Ring?
I'll give it to you, Gandalf!
You're wise and powerful.
Well, will you not...
No! Do not tempt me.
I would wish to turn it to good, and it cannot be used so.
Meaning to be kind, I would become as terrible as the Dark Lord himself.
Do not tempt me!
I shall have such need of strength so soon.
Then I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it.
I ought to go away somewhere, alone.
But they won't bother the Shire if the Ring isn't here.
My dear Frodo...
...I am afraid you are right.
You'll have to go and leave the name of Baggins behind you.
That name is no longer safe.
Your new traveling name shall be:
Mr. Underhill.
What have you heard, and why did you listen?
Mr. Frodo, sir, don't let him hurt me, sir!
Don't let him turn me into anything unnatural.
Well?
Answer him, Sam.
Well, I heard a deal that I didn't rightly understand...
...about an enemy and rings, and about Elves, sir.
Why, I would dearly love to see Elves,
Mr. Frodo.
And so you shall, Sam.
So you shall. Indeed, you should go to the Elves first, to Rivendell.
Tell everyone you are moving away...
...to live in Buckleberry, with those cousins of yours, Pippin and Merry.
However you manage it, do it soon, by your birthday at the latest.
I should be back by then.
I must go south, to consult with the Wizard Saruman...
...the head of my order. Be careful, Frodo.
Me, go, sir? Me, go and see the Elves?
Oh, my! Hooray!
I have come for your aid,
Saruman the White, in troubled times.
The Nine are abroad.
Darkness approaches, the Black Riders!
Is that all the news you have for me then?
Is that not enough?
Sauron is moving at last!
We can deal with Sauron ourselves.
You and I, one way or another.
What talk is this?
What are you saying, Saruman?
It is time for us to choose.
A new age is upon us.
A new power is rising.
Nothing that Men or Elves or Wizards can do will avail against it.
Its enemies are utterly doomed, but its friends...
You are saying that we should join with Mordor?
With him?
Does that displease you?
Where is the Ring, Gandalf?
Why do the Black Riders search for it in the Shire?
Have you hidden it there?
Would you rather see the Dark Lord have it...
...or Saruman of many colors?
Neither of you will have it.
There is a third choice.
It is to remain here...
...until you tell me where the Ring may be found.
Saruman, if you do this...
...if you delay me here,
Sauron will surely get it then.
Then he will know his good servants...
...and his enemies.
Saruman!
Saruman!
I don't feel right going off without Gandalf,
Mr. Frodo.
I wish we could've waited, that I do.
So do I, Sam, but he said to leave as soon as we could.
And Merry and Pippin insisted on coming with us, as far as Bree, for the fun of it.
There's someone coming up ahead,
Mr. Frodo. I can hear a horse.
Good. I'm tired of looking at my cousins all day.
I think we should get off the road.
I don't want to be seen leaving the Shire.
But it might be Gandalf.
Then we'll surprise him. Hurry!
We're going with you, Frodo.
With me?
But how do you... Sam.
- But you gave your word.
- They already knew so much, Mr. Frodo.
Sam didn't tell us about the Ring, Frodo.
I saw Bilbo use it once, before he left, to hide from the Sackville-Bagginses.
And after that,
Pippin and I kept on the lookout...
...and we followed you.
We asked questions everywhere.
And we even wormed a few things out of Gandalf.
And you spied on me.
And Sam helped you.
And we spied on you.
But we meant no wrong to you, Mr. Frodo.
Don't you remember what Mr. Gandalf said?
"Take someone you can trust," he said.
- It doesn't seem that I can trust anyone.
- It all depends on what you want.
You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin, to the bitter end.
But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone...
...and go off without a word.
We're your friends, Frodo.
Bless you, you deceitful scoundrels.
Hooray!
Will we be stopping at Bree tonight,
Mr. Frodo?
I think so, Sam.
We all need a fireside and a bath, and a proper night's sleep in a real bed.
I do wish Gandalf were with us.
Maybe he'll be at the inn when we get there.
Maybe.
I think I'll go out for a sniff of air.
Mind yourselves. Don't forget:
You're supposed to be escaping in secret.
Oh, mind yourself! Don't get lost.
Be careful, Merry.
Quiet!
Quiet, all!
We have some visitors with us tonight, all the way from the Shire.
What was your name again, sir?
Mr. Underhill.
Mr. Underhill and his party.
Yes, Mr. Underhill, sing us a Shire song!
Well, a short one, then.
"There is an inn, a merry old inn
Beneath an old gray hill
"And there they brew a beer so brown
"With a fol-de-doo and a fol-de-da
"Hobbits all of the Shire are we"
Who's there?
Who's there?
"With a ping and a pang
The fiddle-strings broke
"The cow jumped over the Moon"
Where did he go?
What's going on here?
Take your magic tricks back to the Shire!
What's this place coming to,
I'd like to know?
Well, Mr. Underhill...
...frightening my customers and breaking my crocks with your acrobatics!
Very sorry, it's quite unintentional, a most unfortunate accident.
Well, you have put your foot in it this time.
Who are you?
I am called Strider.
- Everyone knows me here.
- Well, we don't!
You've been very careless so far,
Mr. Frodo Baggins.
My name is Mr. Underhill.
After your performance tonight, it won't matter what you're called.
The Black Riders will know who you are by morning.
They already know what you bear.
Who are you really?
I am Gandalf's friend.
He asked me to watch out for you.
Gandalf? Have you seen him?
Where is he?
I do not know.
We were supposed to meet him here, but I've had no word, no message.
It is the first time that I've ever feared for him.
Then we will have to go on by ourselves tomorrow.
To Rivendell?
You'd never get there. The Black Riders are watching the road night and day.
They will come on you in the wild, in some dark place, where there's no help.
I know the wild country.
I can take you to Rivendell by paths that are seldom trodden.
Will you have me?
With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I'd say no.
This Strider, he says be more careful,
I say, let's start with him.
How do we know he's from Gandalf?
More likely, he's a playacting spy, working for...
- For them.
- I don't know, Sam.
I think one of the Enemy's servants would, well...
...seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.
While I look foul and feel fair, is that it?
Well, no, I meant...
Frodo!
Frodo, I've seen them!
I've seen them, Frodo!
I've seen them! Black Riders!
My men found him lying in the street.
There were two of them.
They were hissing to each other.
I seemed to be drawn towards them.
Well, you do need looking after, all of you.
There's been strange folk about for days.
That Ranger...
...Strider coming and going and... Strider!
- They've come from Mordor.
- Save us!
They won't trouble you once I am gone.
Strider came to offer me his help.
You know your own business, maybe...
...but in your place, I wouldn't take up with a ranger out of the wild.
They have no choice.
There is no one else for them except a fat innkeeper...
...who only remembers his name because people shout it at him all day!
I'll do what I can to help, Mr. Baggins.
Mr. Underhill.
I'm no hero, but I'll do what I can.
Keep watch tonight, you and your folk.
There is a hill called Weathertop...
...about half way between here and Rivendell.
We will make for it tomorrow.
So will Gandalf, if he can.
I still don't know if we can trust him,
Mr. Frodo.
I said, you have no choice, Sam.
Because, if I wanted the Ring for myself...
...I could have it, now.
My name is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
If by life or death I can save you, I will.
How long will we be in these marshes, Aragorn?
At least two days.
I'm being eaten alive!
What do these things live on when they can't get Hobbits?
Easy there, Bill, easy, slow.
That is Weathertop.
We shall be there by nightfall, if we set a good pace and don't stop for lunch.
If this continues I'll become a wraith.
Don't speak of such things.
Aragorn! Aragorn!
And Beren was a mortal man...
...but Luthien Tinúviel was the daughter of a king of Elves...
...and she was the fairest maiden that has been among all the children of this world.
Yet she chose to be mortal, for him.
And when he died, she followed him.
And so he was her doom...
...but he was her love as well.
I thought I saw something!
Or maybe just shadows in the moonlight,
I don't know.
Just stand close to the fire. Make a circle.
What's that?
The Ring, Frodo! Take off the Ring!
Cold... It's so cold.
- Like a poisoned icicle.
- It is the cold of their world, Frodo.
When you put on the Ring, you entered the world of the Black Riders.
Gandalf said not to.
Why is it so misty here?
I can't see very well.
Well, what's the matter with him?
It was only a little wound.
It was an evil knife that struck him, Sam.
I think that a piece broke off in the wound and is working inward.
If it reaches his heart...
Can you do anything?
We must get to Rivendell very soon.
He can't go no further.
He must! Do you want them to take him?
Wait, listen.
Legolas!
Yes, Sam, that's an elf.
So, there has been no word of Gandalf in Rivendell? No message at all?
None.
My Lord Elrond has sent every rider he could spare to seek for you...
...knowing that you bore a great burden without guidance.
I have been on the road for nine days.
Well, Mr. Frodo has been on the road a lot longer than that.
And he's sick and he needs a rest.
Just for a while.
No resting can help your Mr. Frodo now.
Only the hands of Elrond in Rivendell can do that.
There are five Black Riders close behind us...
...and we may well find the other four waiting at the ford.
If we lose even a little time, we lose, Frodo, the Ring...
...and Middle-earth.
Do you understand me, Sam?
There is the ford of Rivendell.
Fly! The Enemy is upon us!
Come back. To Mordor we will take you.
Gandalf!
Come back, come back.
To Mordor we'll take you.
Come back, come back.
To Mordor, we'll take you.
Go back!
Run, you fool, run!
The Ring!
The Ring!
Go back to the land of Mordor, and follow me no more.
Come back. Come back.
To Mordor we will take you.
Come back. Come back.
Go back!
The Ring.
The Ring!
By all the Shire, you shall have neither the Ring nor me!
No, never. Verily, I come.
I give it unto you.
No, never! Gandalf!
Yes.
I am here, and you are lucky to be here, too...
...after all the absurd things you've done since you left home.
Where's Sam?
And are the others all right?
They've hardly left your side for three days.
Three days?
What happened at the ford?
It all seemed so dim, somehow.
You were beginning to fade, my remarkable friend.
The knifepoint had almost worked its way to your heart.
Oh, I didn't know. Would I have...
You would have become like them.
One of the Ringwraiths...
...the servants of the Dark Lord...
...if you had not resisted to the last.
The river, it rose up against them.
It is Elrond's river.
This is his house and it was Elrond himself who healed you.
If I may say so,
I added a few touches of my own.
The white horses and so on.
If you noticed.
Then that is the end of the Black Riders?
Not so long as the Ring itself exists.
They will fly back to their master in Mordor, empty and crippled...
...until they find new shapes to wear and new beasts to ride.
We have beaten them, just for a while, Frodo.
That's sort of a relief.
I wish that were the truth, Frodo.
I'm afraid we have a new and closer problem at hand.
You have not asked me why I was late getting back to the Shire.
I forgot.
When I was certain that yours was indeed the Master Ring...
... I rode at once to Isengard,
and I thought...
... that if anyone could know
what was best to do with the One Ring...
... it would surely be Saruman the White.
The great eagle, Gwaihir...
... came in answer to my call,
and bore me away.
Saruman has never paid enough
attention to animals.
- But if he should seize the Ring...
- He will become master of all Middle-earth.
The War of the Ring has begun, Frodo.
You will hear the rest in Council when you are well enough. Rest now.
"The leaves were long, the grass was green
"But the hemlock-umbels tall and fair
"And in the glade a light was seen
"Of stars in shadow, shimmering
"Tinúviel was dancing there"
Bilbo!
Hello, Frodo, my lad.
Where have you been?
Why haven't I seen you before?
I've seen a good deal of you, sitting by your side with Sam each day.
Bilbo, have you been here all the time?
All these years?
There didn't seem much reason to be anywhere else, after all.
The food's very good, and I listen, and I think.
A remarkable place altogether.
Yes.
And now, of course, there's all this bustle about that ring of mine.
Fancy the little thing causing such a disturbance. Have you got it here?
Yes, I have.
I'd very much like just to peep at it again, just for a moment.
Put it away.
I understand now.
I'm sorry.
Sorry about everything.
Don't adventures...
...ever have an end?
The Council of Elrond is beginning.
Come with me.
Both of you.
All that morning, the Council of Elrond
debated the history of the One Ring...
... and its master, Sauron.
Gandalf also told all present of Saruman...
... the traitor, and his desire
for the power of the Ring.
Elves and Dwarves, in their turn,
told what they knew of Sauron's...
... preparations for conquest,
and so did Boromir of Gondor.
In Gondor, we are already under attack by the forces of Mordor.
I am Boromir. In a dream...
...I heard a voice crying to me, saying:
"Seek for the sword that was broken."
Here is the sword of Elendil of Gondor...
...who fought the Dark Lord long ago and was slain.
So, Frodo learned at last...
... the true heritage of Aragorn,
the son of Arathorn...
... descendent of Isildur,
who cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand.
Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all?
Bring out the Ring, Frodo.
The time has come.
Isildur's Bane.
The Halfling.
What shall we do with it then, this mightiest of all weapons?
We cannot keep it, we cannot destroy it.
Sauron, who forged it looks for his Ring...
...and Saruman who envies it, searches for its power, too.
I see no other road for us but the most fearful:
The road into Mordor.
We must send the Ring to the fire where it was made:
To Mount Doom.
What foolishness is this?
Why do you speak of hiding and destroying?
The Ring could save all Middle-earth.
Have you heard nothing?
It is Sauron's Ring. To wield it...
...you would have to become Sauron.
I will not touch it!
Nor I.
Our one hope lies in foolishness, Boromir.
The Dark Lord cannot conceive of anyone wishing to destroy his Ring.
He will wait until one of us tries to use it...
...follow every move we make.
And it is just possible that he may not notice...
...the small, quiet feet, walking into peril...
...into Mordor.
Very well. It's plain enough what you're pointing at.
Bilbo, the silly Hobbit, started this affair, and had better finish it, or himself.
When ought I to start?
It has passed beyond you, Bilbo.
This last journey must be for others to make.
Who are they to be?
That is what they're trying to decide here.
I will take the Ring...
...though I do not know the way.
I think that this task is appointed for you, Frodo.
This is the hour of the Shire-folk, at last.
But you won't send him off alone, surely?
You, at least, shall go with him,
Master Samwise.
It is impossible to separate you, even when he is summoned to a Council...
...and you are not.
A nice pickle we've landed ourselves in, Mr. Frodo.
I thought perhaps you might care to have these.
Bilbo, I don't think I should look right.
You can wear the shirt under your clothes.
It's as light as anything.
But I fancy it might turn...
...even the knives of the Black Riders.
I named the sword Sting, long ago.
It's silly, but there you are.
It shines when there are enemies about.
Orcs and things.
There. Now you look just a plain Hobbit on the surface...
Well, take care.
Bring back any old songs and tales you hear.
"I sit beside the fire
"And think of all that I have seen"
Our only hope is in speed and secrecy.
The Company of the Ring shall be nine.
Nine walkers against
the nine Riders of Mordor.
With Sam and Frodo, Gandalf will go.
For the other Free Peoples...
... Legolas shall be for the Elves,
and Gimli, son of Glóin, for the Dwarves.
For Men shall go the valiant...
... Boromir of Gondor,
and Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
And for the last two places,
we will trust to friendship...
... rather than to great wisdom,
Peregrin Took...
... and Meriadoc Brandybuck may also go.
When did you ever know such a storm, so far south?
The Dark Lord's arm has grown long if he can hurl snow at us...
...all the way from Mordor.
His arm has grown long.
No, Gandalf, not that dark way, I beg you!
And what would you suggest?
Returning to Rivendell to wait there for the end? We have no choice, Aragorn!
We might go by way of the Gap of Rohan.
That'd take the Ring too close to Isengard and Saruman. We dare not risk it.
Yet you would risk the mines of Moria.
Where both you and I have walked before and come out again alive.
The memory is very evil.
I do not wish to enter Moria a second time.
And I don't wish to enter it even once.
Nor me.
The question is not who wishes to go, but who will?
There is no other way to pass the mountains.
I will go with you.
My cousin Balin led a company of Dwarves there, many years ago.
There has been no word of them in all that time.
Elves do not walk in the dark earth.
I will go, but I fear for you, Gandalf.
I will not go, not unless the vote of the whole company is against me.
What does the Ring-bearer say?
I do not wish to go.
But I will go, if Gandalf advises it.
Steady, easy, Bill. Old Gandalf will have that gate open in a minute.
- What if he can't?
- I've never seen anything he couldn't do.
Sam!
Fireworks are all very nice, but this is elf magic.
What a people you Dwarves are for hiding things.
On the gates of your most wondrous, ancient kingdom you write:
"Speak, friend, and enter," and no spell in any language can open the door.
Why do you keep looking at the lake, Frodo?
I'm afraid of it.
And there sits our quest.
If we had to bring a wizard at all...
...it should have been Saruman.
Be still, Boromir.
Why? There are other ways to turn, if our Wizard's balked.
I said, from the beginning...
Gandalf, you old fool!
So, all you had to do was say, "friend," and enter.
Those were happier times.
Let us go.
I'm coming, Mr. Frodo! I'm coming!
Into the gateway! All of you!
Poor old Bill!
Gandalf, what was the thing in the water?
I do not know.
There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world.
Whatever it was, it grabbed Frodo first, out of all of us.
Be quiet, Pippin!
We have gone far enough for today.
Let us stop here for the night.
Seems to have been a guardroom.
Yes, there's even a well.
We had better rest here.
It's hard to believe that even Dwarves...
...could have lived in this half-drowned dungeon!
It was a great realm once.
Be still! Both of you!
Which way do we take tomorrow, Gandalf?
I have not decided.
The path to the left smells foul, and I am too weary to choose.
The way ahead feels wrong, somehow.
At least the middle way goes up.
It's time we began to climb again.
Perhaps. I cannot remember.
What's that?
- Pippin!
- Just a stone.
I dropped a stone.
Fool of a Took!
Throw yourself in next time! Be quiet!
Fool of a Pippin!
Yes, this way.
We should find our way down to the Great Gates by tonight.
I shall be glad.
I doubt now that Dwarves ever came back here.
Why should they have come back?
What was left for them to mine?
Mithril silver!
The most precious metal in the world.
"Balin, son of Fundin...
"...Lord of Moria."
They did come back.
It seems to be a record of the colony.
Orc swords. There was a great battle here.
Yes.
"Balin is now Lord of Moria."
Here it says, "We found Mithril."
Now it says:
"Yesterday, Balin, Lord of Moria, fell.
"An Orc shot him from behind a stone.
"We slew the Orc, but many more..."
Then it says, "We have barred the gates."
And something about,
"The Watcher in the Water."
- What do you hear?
- Nothing.
But I feel.
It is grim reading.
"They have taken the bridge.
They are coming!
"We cannot get out!
Drums, drums in the deep!"
There is nothing more.
Gandalf? I don't want to stay here.
We are going now, Pippin.
There is nothing more.
They are coming.
Slam the doors and wedge them.
Keep the east door ajar.
We must not get shut in.
Orcs and something else.
A great Cave-troll, I think.
Out this way!
The Shire!
For the Shire!
Now is the last chance! Run for it!
I'm all right. I can walk.
I thought you were dead.
All of you, down the stairs!
Lead the way, Gimli!
Pippin and Merry next.
Come no closer! I warn you!
Balrog!
Fly, all of you!
Fly, up the stairs and straight on.
Fly! You cannot help me.
You cannot pass.
I am a servant of the Secret Fire.
You cannot pass.
Go back to the shadow.
You cannot pass.
Fly, you fools!
Come. Follow me.
Obey him!
- There may be a bit of a scar, Sam.
- I don't care.
Now it is your turn, Frodo.
I'm all right. What does it matter now?
It matters. We still have a long road, and much to do.
Why? We've no hope without Gandalf.
You know that, Aragorn.
Then we must do without hope.
There is always vengeance.
Mithril shirt!
That's what saved you.
I have never seen one so beautiful.
- There!
- What is it?
The footsteps,
I heard them in Moria, following.
The Orcs will not come after us until dark.
It never sounds like an orc.
They're bare feet and they flap.
Whatever creature it is, it won't follow us where we're going.
Nothing evil passes through Lothlorien.
- That is not what we say in Gondor.
- Then you know nothing in Gondor.
Out of Moria into the Golden Wood.
Is there no way less perilous?
I would almost rather face the Balrog again, than the Lady.
Lothlorien is a place of healing.
There is no evil in it, unless a man...
...brings evil there with him.
- Welcome to Lothlorien.
I am Galadriel and this is my lord, Celeborn.
The forests have told us of your loss.
We sorrow for you, and for all of Middle-earth.
Rest here now for a little, until you are healed.
Your quest is known to us.
We will do what we can to aid you.
Frodo Baggins of the Shire?
"Let the night never cease to call you
"Let the day never more be the same"
It is a song about Gandalf, isn't it?
Yes, Mithrandir was the Elves' name for him.
It means, Grey Pilgrim.
We knew so little of him in the Shire,
Aragorn. He was just Gandalf, to us.
We never knew he had so many names.
I think he was fondest of Gandalf.
"We're still guided by your light
"You're walking beside us
"A prayer in the night
"With the fear rushing through the shadows
"Like a star shining deep in his heart
"You will know in your hearts forever
"Never more
"Will we stand
"Alone"
This is the mirror of Galadriel.
It shows things that were, and things that are...
...and things that yet may be.
Do you wish to look?
I'd not mind a glimpse of what's going on at home.
It seems a terrible long time
I've been away.
Come then, you shall look...
...and see what you may.
I got to go home!
They've dug up Bagshot Row...
...and thrown my poor old Gaffer out in the street.
I've got to go home.
The mirror shows many things, Sam, and not all have yet come to pass.
Some never come to be, unless those that behold the visions...
...turn aside from their path to prevent them.
Do you wish to leave Frodo now, and go home?
No.
Gandalf?
No, it must be Saruman.
Do not touch the water.
He is looking for you.
But he cannot find you, not here, not yet.
The door is closed.
"Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky."
Yes.
We hid those three from him, and he has never touched them.
If your quest fails, then nothing can stand...
...against him and we are defenseless.
Yet, if you succeed, if the One Ring is destroyed...
...all we built with the three will fade.
Time will come here, and Lothlorien will fade.
You are the footstep of doom to us, Frodo.
Lady Galadriel, I will give you the One Ring, if you ask for it.
It's too great a matter for me.
And I came to test your heart.
You will give me the Great Ring freely...
...and in place of the Dark Lord you will set up a queen.
And I shall not be evil, but beautiful...
...and terrible as the morning and the night.
Stronger than the foundations of the earth.
All shall love me and despair!
I pass the test.
I will diminish and go into the west...
...and remain Galadriel.
And you must depart in the morning.
For Gondor and the House of Isildur.
For Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith.
In a few days, we will have to choose:
Shall we turn west with Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor...
...or turn east to Mordor and its Dark Lord?
Or shall we break our fellowship?
I'm going with Mr. Frodo.
I know that, Sam.
What a place. What a horrible place!
Behold the Argonath, the pillars of the kings.
They are Isildur and Anarion, my fathers of old.
If Gandalf were here...
The day has come at last, the day of choice, which we have long delayed.
What shall now become of our company?
I am not Gandalf.
I have tried to guide you as he would've done, but...
...if he had any plan for this moment, he never told me.
Even if he had, if he had lived...
...I think the burden would still have fallen on you, Frodo.
You alone can choose your way now.
The burden is heavy.
Give me an hour longer, and I will speak.
Let me be alone!
You shall have your hour.
And you shall be alone.
Who's there?
Boromir.
I was afraid for you, Frodo.
The Orcs may be on this side of the river by now.
May I stay and talk to you, just for a while?
You're kind, but there's nothing to be said.
I know what I should do, but I'm afraid of doing it, Boromir.
I wish I could help you.
Will you hear my counsel?
I know what your advice would be:
To go with you to Gondor and use the Ring to defend Minas Tirith.
And is that such ill counsel?
Why should we fear to use the Ring in a just cause?
Whatever is done with the Ring turns to evil.
Gandalf and Elrond refused to touch it, and Galadriel herself...
Yes, I know all that.
And for themselves, they may be right, these Elves and half-Elves and Wizards!
But truehearted Men will not be corrupted.
We, of Minas Tirith, do not seek power.
Only the strength to defend ourselves.
Where is the evil in that, Frodo?
You cannot answer me, none of them can.
It's folly not using the Enemy's power against him.
Think what Aragorn could do with the Ring in this hour.
Or if he refuses, why not Boromir?
How I would drive the hosts of Mordor, until I stood face to face with Sauron.
And they tell us to throw it away!
Come with me, Frodo.
My city is not far.
You can go to Mordor from there, if you must.
Only, trust me, let me try my plan.
Lend me the Ring.
No, Boromir. No!
Fool, obstinate fool!
It is only yours by chance.
It might have been mine.
It should be mine. Give it to me!
Miserable trickster!
You'll sell us all to Sauron.
Traitor!
Curse you to death and darkness, all you Halflings!
What have I done?
Frodo, come back!
A madness took me, but it has passed.
Come back!
This waiting's horrible.
Where have you been, Boromir?
Have you seen Frodo?
I tried to convince him to come to Minas Tirith.
I grew angry and he vanished.
Is that all you have to say?
He put the Ring on.
But where did he go? Where is he?
Mr. Frodo!
Gimli, Legolas, stop them!
I don't know what part you've played in this mischief, but help now!
Go after Merry and Pippin and guard them, even if you cannot find Frodo. Go on!
Follow me, Sam. Stay close.
Sam Gamgee, your legs are too short, so use your head.
The boats.
Coming, Mr. Frodo.
Coming!
It's only water, now.
I'm here, Sam.
Save me, Mr. Frodo.
Help, I'm drowning!
- Take my hand.
- Where's your hand?
Here. Here it is.
Of all the confounded nuisances
I ever knew.
Mr. Frodo, that's hard.
If I hadn't guessed right, where would you be now?
Safely on my way.
"Safely"?
All alone and without me to help you?
But I am going to Mordor.
Well, of course you are,
Mr. Frodo, and I'm coming with you.
It's no good trying to escape you.
I'm glad, Sam.
May the others find a safe road.
Aragorn will look after them.
I don't suppose we shall see them again.
Yet we may, Mr. Frodo. We may.
- This way!
- Frodo!
Halfling.
Boromir.
Boromir.
I tried to take the Ring from Frodo.
I'm sorry. I have paid.
Aragorn, go to Minas Tirith.
Save my people.
Aragorn...
I will go...
...I promise you.
The Halflings, Orcs took them.
I think they are not dead.
Either we take the last boat and follow
Frodo, or we follow the Orcs on foot.
Pippin and Merry may be dead by now.
We don't know.
We cannot forsake them.
The fate of the Ring-bearer is in my hands no longer.
The Company of the Ring has played its part. We follow the Orcs.
Filth!
Maggots!
Can't run.
Hello, Pippin.
So you've come on this expedition, too?
When do we get bed and breakfast?
Bed and breakfast in Isengard, understand?
They are alive.
One of them, anyway.
Pippin, I think, by the footprints.
How far ahead of us are they, Aragorn?
Almost a day. Shall we rest by night, or go on while our strength holds?
Do you think the Orcs will rest?
Yet, in the dark we may lose the trail, or miss a sign, like that brooch.
There will be no more signs.
I cannot run all the way to Isengard.
Thank goodness for that rope the Elves gave you.
We'd never have gotten down that last cliff without it.
There's Mount Doom again, Mr. Frodo.
See it?
What a fix!
The one place that we don't want to see any closer...
...and that's the one place we're trying to get to.
We're plain lost, Mr. Frodo.
I'm tired, Sam.
I don't know what's to be done.
We must find a place to camp, I suppose.
Maybe there'll be a path tomorrow.
Cautious, my precious.
Don't turn!
It's him.
That Gollum?
That thing who had Mr. Bilbo's ring?
He's been following us since Moria.
My precious! More haste, less speed.
Well, he'll be sorry he found us again.
Be careful!
He's much more dangerous than he looks.
Where is it, my precious?
It's ours, it is, and we wants it.
Got you, you spying...
Let go, Gollum!
Let go, or I'll cut your throat!
Don't hurt us!
Don't let them hurt us, precious.
Cruel little Hobbitses.
Jumps on us like cats on poor mices, Gollum.
We'll be nice to them if they'll be nice to us, won't we, precious?
Pity Mr. Bilbo didn't kill the creature when he had the chance.
I will not touch him.
Now that I see him, I do pity him.
Yes, Hobbits won't kill us, not Hobbits, huh?
No, we won't.
But we won't let you go, either.
You will have to come with us and help us, if you can.
Yes, indeed!
Nice Hobbits!
And where are they going in these cold, hard lands, we wonder?
We are going to Mordor. You know that.
Lead us to the gates of his land.
No, precious.
Hobbits mustn't go there.
Gollum! Leave us alone!
Gotcha!
I think your rope might prove useful again.
Tie one end to his ankle.
We want him to walk.
Don't hurt us! No!
It burns! It bites!
It freezes!
Take it off us. It hurts us.
Don't you do it!
It hurts us.
What promise can you give me that I can trust?
Sméagol will be very good.
Sméagol will swear never to let him have it.
Sméagol will save it.
The precious is before you, Sméagol.
Speak your promise!
We promises, yes, I promise...
...I will serve the master of the precious.
- Good master.
- Good Sméagol.
Take the rope off, Sam.
Off we go. Follow Sméagol.
Sméagol knows a secret way, he does, across the marshes.
Follow Sméagol.
I said, "No shooting."
You're wasting arrows, dunghill swine!
Snaga, Lugdush, stand guard.
Bind their legs.
White-skins break through. Understand?
You and your stinking Wizard.
You got us into this.
When I tell them in Mordor...
They are far, far away.
If stinking Wizard doesn't get you, the white-skins will.
You won't get it that way.
It isn't easy to find.
Get it? Get what?
Nothing, my precious.
It's no good groping in the dark.
Ugluk will be back any minute.
Nothing for Mordor.
Nothing for poor Grishnakh and Gollum.
- Untie us, my precious.
- I said to be quiet!
Wait. You can't find it without our help.
You help me.
I don't know what to do now.
I don't even know where we are.
You should have studied maps more and played less in Rivendell.
This is Fangorn Forest.
Then we're no safer than we were with the Orcs.
We've no blankets and almost no food.
It looks like nothing to eat for 100 miles.
We don't even know where we're trying to go.
Let's climb up there.
Maybe we can find out where we are, at least.
It's nice here.
The forest looks so different in the sunlight.
I know.
It's funny, but, well,
I almost feel I like the place.
Almost felt you liked the forest?
That's uncommonly kind of you.
The Orcs made us run here, and when we tired...
...they carried us, cut our ropes and ran into the forest and we came to your hill...
"Hill?"
A hasty word...
...for something that has stood here since the world was shaped.
You may call me Treebeard.
We thought you were a tree, standing there.
Not a tree, a tree herder.
Please, Treebeard...
...now that you know our story...
...whose side are you on?
I am not altogether on anybody's side...
...because nobody is altogether on my side.
But I am no friend of these...
...tree-killing Orcs and their masters.
They were here, no doubt of it.
- But where they went...
- I don't understand these other marks.
Look!
Your bow, Legolas! It's Saruman.
- Shoot before he puts a spell on us, fast!
- Elf...
...Man and Dwarf together?
A rare sight in these times.
Stop him, Legolas!
Gandalf?
Beyond all hope.
Gandalf!
Yes.
That was my name.
But where have you... Gandalf!
What happened?
A long time I fell.
Long I fell and he fell with me.
His fire was about me.
I was burned.
Ever he clutched me, and ever
I hewed him, far under the living earth...
... until at last, he fled back up
the secret ways of Moria.
There we fought,
above the mists of the world...
... and the mountain was wreathed
with lightning.
I threw down my enemy
and his fall broke the mountainside.
Then darkness took me...
... and I wandered far,
on roads that I will not tell.
Naked, I was sent back for a brief time...
...until my task was done.
And it is time I was about it.
You come with me to Edoras, my friends, to the city of the Riders?
To Edoras, now?
But to leave Merry and Pippin?
They are in no danger, believe me.
The great danger is to Edoras.
Saruman's Orcs will attack there within
two days, and Theoden has need of us.
Theoden has grown old.
He shivers by his fire now...
... and leaves everything in the hands
of his new minister:
Grima Wormtongue.
Those Riders you followed,
who rescued Merry and Pippin...
... they were led by Theoden's nephew,
Eomer.
He is all but an outlaw
in Rohan these days.
He hunts the Orcs
wherever he finds them...
... defying Wormtongue's orders
to let them pass.
So Wormtongue calls him traitor
and renegade...
... and Theoden believes...
Gandalf, the Riders of Rohan
are the bravest fighters...
... but they were never many.
If Saruman strikes now,
he'll overrun Edoras in a single night.
Our time is at hand.
Theoden's hundreds will face your tens of thousands.
When all of Rohan, your ancient oppressor, lies vanquished...
...then shall we fly eastward...
...and sweep all of Middle-earth beneath our feet.
We cannot be defeated!
Halfway between Edoras and Isengard,
there lies a fortress called Helm's Deep.
If we can decoy Saruman's Orcs there...
... the fortress will stop them longer
than the wooden halls of Edoras.
We are buying time, Aragorn.
Time? Time for what?
Perhaps for a miracle.
Perhaps only for Frodo to get a little further on his way...
...while the armies that should be hunting for the Ring...
...waste their own time destroying us.
I have returned.
The storm comes swiftly, and it is time for all friends to gather together.
And...
...do you...
...expect me...
...to welcome you here...
...Master Gandalf?
Troubles follow you like crows.
Why should I welcome you,
Gandalf Stormcrow?
Justly spoken, Lord.
In the east, the Dark Lord is stirring...
...in Lorien, the Sorceress of the Golden Wood weaves deceit.
And such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses to return.
It is I...
...who counsel the King now.
He hears you no longer.
No, Grima Wormtongue.
He hears nothing but your voice telling him that he rules here...
...only because Saruman is kind to old men...
...and that the best thing for a sickly, feeble king...
...is to let Wizards and Orcs do as they will in Rohan.
I am my own man, Gandalf...
...as I was.
It is true that...
...Grima advises me often to leave
Saruman in peace...
Hear, my Lord, you tire yourself.
You are still unwell.
And he does remind me that it would be safest for Rohan...
...to seek their friendship...
...no matter how I may feel!
Dear Lord, let me deal with these troublesome guests.
How long has it been, Grima Wormtongue?
How long since Saruman bought you?
For I saw you at Isengard.
Did I not counsel your doorkeeper to forbid his staff?
Down, snake.
Down on your belly.
Grima is often...
...at Isengard.
I sent him there with messages.
And he returns with poison...
...Saruman's poison in your ears, Theoden.
Chilling your heart, making you old.
Take courage, Lord of Rohan!
Grima...
...is this so?
I will not harm you, Grima.
Is it so?
Let him go!
My sister-daughter, Eowyn.
My only loyal kin...
...since her brother has disobeyed my commands.
Wormtongue's command, Theoden.
If Eomer had not defied him...
...their cause might be already lost.
- Tell me, Gandalf...
...what I must do now.
We cannot wait here for Saruman's attack.
Every man that can ride must be sent immediately...
...to the old fortress of Helm's Deep.
When Saruman learns that we have gone there, and he will...
...we will have the Riders of Rohan.
I will find Eomer and his Riders.
My armor!
Look for me at Helm's Deep.
That's all, Theoden.
And he's gone again...
...like a wind in the grass.
Stormcrow.
- Aragorn?
- My Lord?
Is there any hope for us?
Sam, you simpleminded...
You fell asleep.
Mr. Frodo, he's gone.
- Sméagol?
- He's gone. I didn't mean to sleep.
Well, he'll come back.
Promise will hold him a while yet.
He won't leave his precious, anyway.
Are we rested?
Ready to go on?
Nice Hobbitses.
Trust Sméagol now?
Stop!
Shivery light.
Nasty.
Look!
Wraiths.
Wraiths on wings!
The precious is calling them!
Gollum, wait, Mr. Frodo can't keep up!
Slow down, I tell you.
No time, no time.
The precious is heavy, yes.
Very heavy, Sméagol knows.
If it's too heavy for nice Master...
...little Sméagol will carry it.
Sméagol doesn't mind.
Give it to Sméagol.
Do not say that again.
Do not think it.
Before you touched the precious again,
Sméagol...
...I would put it on and have you leap off a cliff, or into a fire...
...and you would do it, Sméagol.
Nice, Master.
Nice, Master.
Gollum!
Sméagol promised.
Yes, we promised to save our precious...
...never to let him have it, but it's...
...going to him, my precious is nearer every step.
I can't help it.
Sméagol promised to help nice Hobbit.
He took cruel rope off our leg.
He speaks nicely to me.
He's a Baggins, my precious.
A Baggins stoled it.
We hates Bagginses.
Must have the precious. Must have it.
We wants it.
But there's two of them.
Yes.
We needs help, precious.
She might help, yes.
She might help us...
...but Sméagol promised nice Hobbit.
Nice Hobbit.
Hey, you...
...what are you pawing at him for?
Where've you been anyway, sneaking off and sneaking back?
"Sneaking"?
Hobbit's always so polite, yes.
Tired, thirsty Sméagol, he finds a secret way through the mountain...
...a tunnel with no Orcses anywhere, and they say "sneak."
"Sneak"?
Well, you startled me. I'm sorry.
Hello, Sméagol.
- Where have you been?
- Sneaking!
I like this place.
There is good rock here.
This country has tough bones.
Up on the ridge! They're coming!
There they are!
Fire of Isengard!
We're breached. Retreat to the caves.
The caves!
Theoden King.
I will not end here...
...taken like an old badger in a trap.
When dawn comes...
...I will bid men sound Helm's horn...
...and I will ride forth.
Will you ride with me then, son of Arathorn?
At least, we may make such an end...
...as will be worth a song.
I will ride with you.
We're there, Sam.
Another day, maybe two.
When light comes tomorrow, the mountains will be near.
Well, it's a good thing, Mr. Frodo, because we're running awful low on food.
I reckon we've got enough left to see us to this Mount Doom.
After that...
...I don't know.
Samwise Gamgee.
My dearest Hobbit, friend of friends...
..."after that," if the Ring goes into the fire, and we are at hand?
"After that," dear Sam.
I wouldn't worry.
Just to get there.
Just to get there.
The Ring is so heavy now, Sam.
We must go.
Mustn't rest here, silly Hobbits.
Orcs find us. Ringwraiths find us.
Must go on to safe, secret place.
Sméagol's secret way!
The straight stair...
...and the winding stair. Up, up...
...through black, sharp mountains.
Follow good Sméagol.
Straight stair, winding stair...
...what comes after that?
We shall see, yes...
...we shall see.
Gandalf!
The forces of darkness were driven
forever from the face of Middle-earth...
... by the valiant friends of Frodo.
As their gallant battle ended...
... so too ends the first great tale of...
...The Lord of the Rings.
Good evening, everyone, and welcome to Houston, the Energy City, home of the defending
Rollerball World Champions.
This key international battle pits divisional champions, visiting Madrid, against powerful Houston.
And here they come for a standing ovation.
On the track comes Houston.
Houston, led by captain Jonathan E., again their leading scorer this year.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Okay, right there. Let's go.
The controller indicates that he is ready, and our 30 Multivision cameras will be bringing you all the speed, thrills and excitement of this critical game.
Ladies and gentlemen, our corporate anthem.
The controller tests his computerized equipment, readies for the start of game action.
The traditional firing of the test ball will signal we're about set to go.
The controller for tonight's game, D.A. Niehaus.
The officials have given their approval for play. Each team...
Come on, man.
And now the crowd cheers once again as this Houston audience greets its team led by the storied athlete Jonathan E.
Corral's gonna break off.
Okay, boys! Okay.
Houston! Houston!
Now the play-by-play. Here's RD.
The computer counts down, one second, the ball...
First period is underway here in Houston tonight.
The first team to pick up the ball will be on offense as they try for the score.
And it's a pickup by Houston.
It's picked up by BJ.
Yay!
BJ moves it around the track.
He'll try to maneuver for the leading score...
Go on, go on.
Watch it!
Jonathan E. holds the ball aloft.
He must hold it out in plain view at all times.
Pick them up! Pick them up!
I got them! I got it!
On your right! On your right! Now, baby!
Jonathan moves up the track and up on to the side.
Here comes Sanchez for Madrid.
Sanchez grabs Jonathan from behind, but off the rail comes Moonpie and takes out four Madrid men.
The old swooper, Moonpie, with his favorite maneuver, made a move from the top of the rail and took out four Madrid men.
The remaining Madrid skaters set up their defense in front of the goal.
Jonathan still has the ball.
Moving in, he'll try to cover the slot, and surely does!
Jonathan in front, shoots, and it's just wide!
Regroup!
The Houston team will have to regroup.
Injured on the play is Belmonte, and he's helped off the track for Madrid.
First period, no score, as we get set for the firing of the second ball.
Oh, and it hits the biker Carter!
Knocks Carter down...
Give me a hand. Move out!
Come on, look alive!
Jonathan is there, it is handed off, the pass is complete to Jonathan.
He skates by and knocks him down again!
Did you see that penalty?
And the officials look this over...
Keep up. Keep up.
Moon, on your left. On your left.
Right, right, right. I got him!
Break it up! Break it up!
Go, Jonathan, go!
Here comes Houston for the first goal of the game.
He shoots, he scores!
Yeah!
And at the end of the first period,
Jonathan's goal gives Houston a one-to-nothing lead over Madrid.
Houston goal scored by Jonathan E.
The time, first period, 12 minutes.
The ball is fired for the start of the second period.
Madrid trailing by one goal, trying to go on offense to tie the score.
Go, Madrid!
Watch your left!
Who did it?
Coming around the track...
Come on, Madrid, come on.
Inside of the bike, he skates up in front.
Gonzales still has it for Madrid.
Hands off again, this time to Bodeas.
Bodeas on offense for the Madrid team.
Here's the Houston defense in a four-man defense...
Shot! It is cleared.
And out of the pack goes Bodeas, but he's all right, he's not injured, but his scoring attempt failed.
And the score is still one-to-nothing in favor of Houston.
The ball is fired again. Madrid is pressing now, putting the pressure on...
Keep it moving!
All right, come on, let's move it.
We got it now.
Sanchez is moving to his left and right, has a full head of steam, still going in on offense, trying to tie the score.
Sanchez moves around the bike, takes a long look and shoots and he scores!
Sanchez scores with a play that ties the game at 1-1.
Second period.
The ball is in play again, intercepted this time by Haskell.
Three minutes. Get off.
Madrid penalty.
Three minutes, biking misconduct on number one, Meitzer.
Are you satisfied, Madrid? What kind of game are you guys playing out there?
Take it easy, take it easy.
You'll be okay.
This crowd's going wild, loving the wide-open action in this quarterfinal game.
Skate! Skate!
Come on, God damn it, skate!
Houston! Houston!
All go down, pileup on the track, the ball rolls free and into the gutter. It's a dead ball.
Come here, come here!
Come on, block that side.
Come on, move out.
How is it, Jonathan?
- Give me a tie, will you, Bo?
- Sure.
Come on, dude!
Three minute penalty. Hey!
Don't give me any of that.
Off the track. Off the track.
Group up.
Hold the line! Hold the line!
Up and over the Madrid defense, gets up in front of the goal and he jams it in for the score!
Jonathan jams it in and scores to get Houston a 2-1 lead over Madrid.
Houston with the ball again here in the third period.
Stop it!
He has it.
Jonathan behind the bike, coming in low with a great maneuver, he shoots, he scores!
That's the way! You got it!
I love this game,
Moonpie. I love it.
Yeah.
So, we've got two games left.
Guess who we play first? Tokyo.
Now who would have thought they'd make it to the playoffs?
They're good.
They've got the old samurai spirit.
Yeah, but they're only about this tall.
Yeah, well, two or three little things make one big thing.
They're liable to climb all over you and eat your lunch.
I can't get on a man-to-man basis with a pigmy or an oriental.
I don't know what it is.
You were fine tonight, all of you.
Mean. Sharp.
Thank you.
Your fellas did well again.
Thank you, Mr. Bartholomew, sir.
Thank you.
You? You rode. You really rode.
Yeah.
You play like our champion here.
You take lessons from him?
No. We just give lessons to the other team.
Yeah!
How are you, Jonathan?
I'm feeling mean, Mr. Bartholomew.
It's good to see you.
Jonathan E. That's the name.
Houston players come and go, but the champion plays on.
Yeah!
The corporation has a hard time, Moonpie, figuring out ways to pay the champion properly.
We can't think up any more rewards for him.
You'd like us to have that problem with you, wouldn't you?
Yes, sir.
Like Jonathan, you play with abandon, but this is Jonathan's season.
Every season seems to be Jonathan's season, but this year, we've got you on Multivision.
A special show all about you.
No player ever had that before.
The whole world will be watching, because this is your year.
You got it, babe.
So, two games left.
That's right, Mr. Bartholomew.
New York in the final!
Team seems healthy, champion says he feels mean, no problems here.
What is this, fruit juice?
Very healthy, Mr. Bartholomew, very healthy.
Sweet dreams, Moonpie.
It's a bad habit you got there.
You know what that habit will make you dream, Moonpie?
You'll dream you're an executive.
And you'll have your hands on all the controls, and you'll wear a gray suit, and you'll make decisions.
But you know what, Moonpie?
You know what those executives dream about out there, behind their desks?
They dream they're great rollerballers.
They dream they're Jonathan.
They have muscles, they bash in faces.
Let's go. Can't keep these boys here all night.
Jonathan, come and see me tomorrow.
Quiet, boys, quiet.
This is a great team.
A great city. Great stuff out there tonight.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
- Good morning.
- How are you, sir?
Brutal game last night.
Oh, thank you.
Continue to hold my calls, all right? Thank you.
Come in, Jonathan.
Keep silence with me for a minute, won't you?
It's important to have a place to think things out.
You have your ranch. I know you take a lot of pleasure in it.
I, uh, cut my finger.
I'm sorry. Here.
You've had an amazing career, Jonathan.
You know how proud we are of the Houston team, and what we think of you, the energy?
But now, there are executives who want you out.
Sir?
You've had 10 years in this game, Jonathan.
Longer than anyone, ever.
Retire? How can I do that?
On your special program.
There are some who feel that this program should now be used to announce your retirement.
Who wants that?
When this special was first planned by
RCI Energy, we saw it as a good thing.
Now the executive directorate wants a change.
The program is scheduled, the whole world is waiting for it, so this does seem the perfect time.
You know, the team, they, uh, they depend on me.
Jonathan, let's think this through together.
You know how a game serves us?
It has a definite social purpose.
Nations are bankrupt, gone, none of that tribal warfare anymore.
Even the corporate wars are a thing of the past.
I know that. It's just...
So now, we have the majors and their executives.
Transport, food, communication, housing, luxury, energy.
A few of us making decisions on a global basis for the common good.
The team, is a unit.
It plays with certain rhythms.
So does an executive team, Jonathan.
Now, everyone has all the comforts, you know that.
No poverty, no sickness, no needs and many luxuries, which you enjoy just as if you were in the executive class.
Corporate society takes care of everything, and all it asks of anyone, or has ever asked of anyone, ever, is not to interfere with management decisions.
I know. I don't mean to resist.
I'm just trying to understand.
This is for your own benefit.
You must know that, Jonathan.
All decisions concerning you are.
Well, I, uh, lost Ella.
The corporation took my wife away because an executive wanted her.
I'm not gonna review all that again.
It was before I took over here, and I had nothing to do with it.
And from what I hear, your wife wanted to leave herself.
So, now you're going to retire.
That shouldn't be too hard for you.
It's a stupid game, after all. Awful game.
You ought to be glad to be out of it.
I don't...
I don't know, Mr. Bartholomew.
I just don't know.
I realize you had nothing to do with Ella leaving...
- Jonathan, I...
- But, um...
You're right.
I mean, I ought to do it.
I ought to be perfectly happy to do what you say...
Take your time. Take a few days.
You've just come through a game. You're tired.
Go to your ranch, but think about it, and understand it.
Do understand it.
Because I don't understand your resistance, and I don't think anyone else will, either.
Was your flight okay?
Yeah. Is Clete here?
He's in the training room.
I'm gonna go say hello.
- Jonathan.
- Hmm?
Look what I got for breakfast.
Hmm?
It's a notice from the corporation.
What's it say?
Oh, that I should get out of here.
You know, go away, vanish.
That kind of thing.
You know anything about that?
Yeah, I kind of heard something about it.
You knew it was coming.
We've been together six months.
Didn't you even want to say goodbye?
We'll talk about it later, okay?
You didn't, did you?
Hmm?
You didn't even want me here when you got back.
I gotta go see Cletus.
What do you want me to do in the meantime?
I want you to take it easy.
Uh...
I want you to go in and fix us something to eat.
Clete's come a long way and I'm hungry.
All right?
Okay.
Jonathan?
I'm glad you're all right.
Come on. All right, come on.
Come.
I'm tired enough.
Yeah. Uh-huh. Well...
- I caught you, didn't I, baby?
- Huh?
- Two games running.
- What?
You did that in the last two games.
Show the forward left.
You're standing on your left skate.
Do that in Tokyo, they'll take your arm home for lunch.
You with me?
Okay.
You practice that a little for me, huh?
All right.
Hell, I forget which corporation is which.
Any ass knows that fire's energy.
What about the music? Where's the music come from, huh?
Okay if I have one of these?
Go on, have all of it.
I forget what corporation's running what city.
Chicago's still a food city, but what about Indianapolis?
Whatever happened to that town?
Whatever happened to Mackie?
Yeah, things were much simpler when I was a kid.
We still had three nations.
That was before the corporate wars, even before rollerball.
Before everything.
You believe in kids?
I remember someone telling me about the National Football
League and the World Cup.
Where you going?
Indianapolis.
What do you know about that stuff, Clete?
I mean...
Know how the corporations got started, about the corporate wars?
They were nasty! Whoo!
But nobody talks about that.
Well, except among friends.
Yeah.
I remember your rookie year.
You were mean and tight.
Best player I ever coached.
Nobody could lay a hand on you that year.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
Look, I... I gotta ask you something.
It figures. Go ahead.
I'm listening.
Well...
Something going on with the game.
I don't know what it is. I don't think I'm supposed to know.
What's that?
They want me to quit.
And why would they want you to do that?
I don't know.
That's what I'd like you to find out.
I can try.
Hear just about everything going on in the game one way or another.
That's what I mean.
I can't think of another executive who'd tell me a thing.
Well, like I say, I'll...
I'll try.
But I don't think there's much I...
Look...
No troubles for either of us, Clete.
Just find out what you can.
Well, trust me, Jonathan, you know you can.
Sure.
Sit down.
Yeah.
Nice, boys.
Yo, Johnny.
That's the Houston stride.
You boys want to make this team, play for
Houston, you're gonna have to learn it.
We pride ourselves on being a power team.
That's right.
We're power. We're mean.
Now, that doesn't mean to say we'd like to have you hanging back there on a rail, in a fistfight, just standing there fighting somebody in section A when you're supposed to be in section B.
I'm coming up to score, and you ain't in the section you're supposed to be in, don't do us no good.
Right.
Who's the two new catchers here?
Right.
Give me that ball.
Don't, uh.
Stick your hand in that gutter too quick.
Wait till this ball comes down on the track.
Don't get too anxious. That thing will take your arm right off.
Now, the bikers.
A biker might sacrifice a little three-minute penalty and run over the top of a skater...
Uh-huh.
If he feels that he's skating a little too good that day.
So we have a few methods here in Houston.
There's hundreds.
One, of course, is to use this shield here.
Use your pads. Use what you got.
Drive that arm in there.
Keep your feet forward.
Hit and move.
You get away from the wreck.
Always keep your feet here.
Don't come across in here.
You get all twisted. That's sad.
Or if a biker's sitting up nice and high...
A lot of guys like to ride high.
Drag one off them in there.
I hurt you, Blue?
I wouldn't hurt him for the world.
Now, third method, kind of one that was perfected by a little friend of mine, the swoop.
Swooper, that's me.
Hang up on the rail, use all the speed of the track, come down and drop-kick a biker.
Say, excuse me.
You're not paying a whole lot of attention, are you?
Hey, what's this dude's name?
That's our new speedball from Manila.
Yeah, you know.
You know, that's Toughie.
Come on up, Tough.
Always a big honker.
Say, why don't you do me and the boys a favor,
I mean, since you know everything there is to know...
We'd sure appreciate it, I want you to give us a little demonstration.
Show us how you made that big rep down there.
Just skate around and just take me out, huh?
Go get him, Toughie.
Now, eyes, use them.
Don't lock your eyes on any one spot.
This game isn't all in the muscle.
Use your head.
Lock your eyes on the target, keep...
Ears, now, they're real important, too.
If there's anything I love, it's luxury centers.
When I get my privilege card,
I know what I'm gonna get me, too.
Secretary.
Why do you want a secretary?
Are you planning on becoming an executive?
I just need one.
About this tall.
Yeah?
Why don't you give it a rest?
Hello.
Can I help you, please?
Yeah, I tried to order some books, and they sent me this notice said I had to appear at the center personally.
That's right. This is our circulation unit.
You can make your choice here or by catalog.
There must be some mistake.
The books you've ordered are classified and have been transcribed and summarized.
Well, who summarizes them?
I suppose the computers summarize them.
What'd you need books for?
Just want to study up on some things.
You could go to the computer center where the real librarians transcribe the books, but we have all the edited versions in our catalog.
Anything I think you'd want.
Well, let's see then.
This is not a library, and you are really not a librarian.
I'm only a clerk. That's right.
I'm sorry about it really.
And the books are really in computer banks being summarized.
Where is that?
Well, there's a computer bank in Washington.
The biggest is in Geneva.
It's a nice place to visit.
- Yeah.
- I guess that's where all the books are now.
Yeah. Well, thank you.
It's not that exactly.
Yeah, but books, Jonathan?
I mean, anything you want to know, you could hire yourself a corporate teacher, see?
I mean, you can call somebody up.
Use your privilege card.
I can't. That's just it.
I feel there's something going on.
Somebody's pushing me.
Who? Bartholomew?
But you're Jonathan E.
Everybody knows you.
You've got everything.
You know you'll be treated right.
You always have been.
Yeah. I don't know.
But I do know! We're living good.
You know we are.
I found this to wear.
Is it all right?
That's the uniform of the house.
I'm Daphne.
Yeah. That figures.
Well, that's all right.
Here. Wear these, too.
That's right, no penalties!
Limited substitutions.
You can handle it!
Beat Tokyo!
All we gotta do is change our tactics.
- That's it.
- Three times...
There's always been rule changes.
Now, look, you know that!
It gets more people to watch the game. That's all there is to it.
Look, you all signed contracts to finish out the season, no matter what the alterations in the game.
Now every last one of you signed.
See? Now we all signed a contract.
That doesn't matter! There's no way we're gonna lose, no matter how they change the game.
That's right. That's right.
All it means is a change of strategy.
Now, we knock out the bikers early, we take care of their skaters.
Don't try to score yourselves.
And the game's yours.
Now, you watch yourselves out there.
They're playing the same rules we are.
It's gonna be rough, but it's still basically the same game.
And the team with the power wins.
Come on.
Hey, Rusty.
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.
Hey, Rusty, come on.
Listen.
You were talking about them contracts.
How come everyone else is being asked to play with the no-penalty rule, and they're pressuring me to quit?
I don't know.
But can't you do what you're told?
For your own good, get out.
I...
I don't want to leave the guys to play Tokyo with the rules breaking down. I mean...
Jonathan, it doesn't matter what you want!
Think about that.
These we did in slow motion to show the impact of your blows on opposing players.
Yeah, fine.
We want you to approve the sequences.
It's, uh...
It's all fine with me.
Anything.
I really don't see why I'm needed here.
Well, the Energy people want you to be satisfied.
Huh.
There, now, isn't that a marvelous shot?
Sure.
I'm a stat freak myself.
Isn't that perverse?
You got anything I can take?
Just... Just take one.
Statistics, huh?
Yes, the greatest number of points scored in a single game, 18.
The highest velocity of a ball when actually fielded by a skater,
120 miles per hour.
Most deaths...
Please, don't do that.
Oh.
Most deaths, nine. Rome versus
Pittsburgh. December, last year.
The greatest number of players and substitutes put out of action by a single player in a single game, 13.
A world's record, courtesy of your dear self.
There have been studies, you know, of stat freaks in rollerball.
Well, some go to the track, but they never take their eyes off the big board.
What's this?
As for myself, I've always wondered if a rollerball player sees himself as a class apart.
"Hello. Pause.
"I'm Jonathan E. Smile.
"I would like..." Is this for me?
Very astute, yes.
It's your retirement announcement.
Your special is already scheduled and announced all over the world.
You're supposed to read this as part of the program.
What sort of pill did you give me?
Pure aphrodisiac, Daph.
Enjoy yourself, dear.
Can we finish up there and go home?
You are being recorded.
Feeling a little woozy, are you?
Try to read the announcement.
I'm all right.
Why don't you read... the...
Oh, you... You want that, do you?
You are making things very difficult...
How many... How many assignments you been on, Daph?
I know you're good at what you're good at, so, you must have been around some.
A lot of girls have stayed with me but you know that.
Never seem to mind.
But odd thoughts I've had about you, Daph, odd thoughts.
I wondered if you'd been briefed on me.
I'm going to have to ask you to read...
Yeah, a lot of things occurred to me, Daph, a lot of things.
A lot of things occur to you?
You look terrible.
You do look terrible.
Come on.
See, you shouldn't take anything offered to you just like that.
What was in it?
Nothing to hurt you.
Maybe you're just a little too trusting.
You ever think of that?
And hook 'em deep now!
I'll do that.
Thank you.
As you know, the Tokyo game is coming up.
And you'll remember that the Tokyo team uses various karate and hapkido techniques.
We will review these techniques with special attention to the use of death blows.
Same lecture every year.
There are certain body areas that the skilled opponent will endeavor to strike...
What we got for our skilled opponents is the old Houston fist-in-the-face technique.
Right?
Especially in a game with no penalties...
You got to get mad, all right? Play hard!
It don't matter that they're all tiny little men on that team.
Especially in a game with no penalties and limited substitution.
Get mad and fly!
Please...
Now, there's certain body areas that I know about, too.
Now, what we gotta do is hit those guys in the ganglion.
Where?
In the ganglion.
It's a mess of nerves right here under the ear.
Now, what you gotta do is drive the jawbone up in that mess of nerves and it rings a bell.
You must understand.
The Tokyo team has a very eccentric playing style.
And no penalties, all right?
If I go down, I know my team is with me!
- Right?
- Please...
Brute speed!
Familiarize yourself with the basic fighting art techniques.
And nobody is gonna take us, rules or no rules!
Go on. Go on.
This is the Houston team!
Rules or no rules!
We fight for each other!
Houston! Houston!
They're really quite beautiful in a wild kind of way.
I can almost smell the lions.
Don't be silly.
They're made in Detroit.
Yes, they're androids.
They're all programmed.
That's right. The whole game is played by robots.
They look like men, and they...
Not so loud. They'll hear you.
It'll ensure stability, expansion and high profits for the planetary enterprise.
What do you think about it?
Exciting. You make it sound absolutely romantic.
He's gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.
I know and he's so intelligent.
We're practically living on krypens.
Hey, there he is.
Hey, Johnny boy. Hey, kid!
Come on, well, let's hear it! Come on.
Give me a hand here.
Give me a hand, will you?
Behave yourself.
Hello, Mackie.
Well, how you been?
You know, it's your night tonight, Jonathan.
You having a good time?
Well...
Well, I'm glad you're here.
I'm here with an executive.
He asked all about you.
He wanted to know if I enjoyed you.
Hey, Rocky.
Hey, come here and give me a hand.
Get on over here.
There's too many of them.
Well, what about the new game?
Actually, I haven't heard much about it.
The rule changes were announced a week ago.
- That so?
- Who changed them?
That's what I've been trying to find out.
Look, rules or no rules, it's still the same game.
What I'm really looking forward to is the program.
When you see that screen replay afterwards...
Excuse me.
Did you hear about Evans?
What?
He's out. Gone.
No kidding.
The old man?
Who got him?
- What?
- I said who got him?
The Crocodile.
Hey. do you like poetry?
Mmm-hmm.
Let's go upstairs?
I got a poem for you.
Ooh.
Welcome, sports enthusiasts everywhere.
Tonight, Multivision trains its cameras on the amazing career of Jonathan E.
In those years that Houston began to mold itself into a world championship team with the attacking style of their lead scorer...
Jonathan, come on.
Come on, come on.
Jonathan E., has always been the team's strongest asset.
Yes, the game seems invented for him.
Defense! Defense!
Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense!
Right on!
Look, I talked to everybody I could.
And there is something going on.
Yeah, you... You're right about that.
Nobody will talk about it.
I mean nobody!
It's hard finding anything out,
Jonathan. You know that.
Hell, nobody even knows the names of the men on the directorate anymore.
Look, I'm sorry, I...
They want you out. You know that.
Yeah.
Well, do you know who they are?
Bartholomew, I guess.
Mmm-mmm.
Above Bartholomew.
It's the Executive Directorate.
Why are they worried about me?
It's what they do.
They're even after the old man because he didn't get your retirement announced tonight.
How come they put the program on without it?
I think they had to. They didn't want to. It's very tricky.
Jonathan, look... There's one thing you ought to know.
Look, nobody said it, but I'm sure of it.
Hmm.
They're afraid of you, Jonathan.
All the way to the top, they are.
What are they afraid of me for?
Oh, no. Don't go yet.
We're showing some replays.
Well, let's see 'em then.
Let's see 'em.
Mr. Bartholomew would like to see you now. He's in the study.
Come on hurry up. Over there.
You know I've always considered your situation, Jonathan.
And your needs.
Now, you have to consider mine.
And ours.
I'm considering it,
Mr. Bartholomew.
No player is greater than the game itself.
It's a significant game in a number of ways.
The velocities of the ball, the awful physics of the track.
In the middle of it all, men, playing by an odd set of rules.
It's not a game men are supposed to grow strong in, Jonathan.
You appreciate that, don't you?
More and more, Mr. Bartholomew.
Shoot that statue.
That's the one. Shoot that!
Hey...
- The tree!
- Yeah! Come on!
You must take good advice.
You're not to play against
Tokyo, you're not to play again.
I want some concessions.
Concessions!
Believe me, I'd be happy to talk a deal, Jonathan.
I love deals.
But this situation is much, much simpler.
This Multivision event tonight was very embarrassing.
For me and for others.
Well... it might be I won't ever find out why
I've been asked to leave the game.
But I do know I can get some concessions and I want them.
Oh, you missed!
I want to see Ella. My wife.
Arrange it so I can see her again.
That's not easy, Jonathan.
I want other concessions, too, Mr. Bartholomew.
Oh! Oh-ho! Look at that!
Give...
By my life, that's incredible!
- Oh!
- That's terrific.
Look at all those flames!
Specifically, you're bargaining for the right to stay in a horrible social spectacle.
It has its purposes, and you've served those purposes brilliantly.
Why argue when you can quit?
And you say you want to know why decisions are made.
Your future comfort is assured.
You don't need to know.
Why argue about decisions you're not powerful enough to make for yourself?
Energy will treat you well.
You know that.
If the rule changes stay the same, Mr. Bartholomew,
I'm playing with my team.
Too late. The rule change is scheduled and announced.
There's no going back.
You've seen to that.
Then I'll see you in Tokyo.
You can be made to quit.
You can be forced.
You can't make me quit.
Hey, watch out!
Don't tell me I can't.
Don't ever say that!
I can!
You can be stopped!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Look, it's all going too fast.
I'm not packed yet. Can't you...
Forget it. You're not going, Daph.
Those bags are ready.
Here. Hold on.
Take this extra hat, will you?
Sir? I've had a call.
I've been asked to go over to Energy.
You're not going to Tokyo then?
What do you mean I'm not going?
I suppose I will later. I hope this isn't an inconvenience.
No. No. It's... No problem.
I'm supposed to go with you.
Well, what's that mean?
Who... Who told you you're supposed to go with me? Hmm?
Nobody told me.
Listen, Jonathan, I really want to go with you.
I do, really.
You'll need me.
Just get yourself another assignment, will you, Daph?
Everybody is an assignment.
Life's an assignment.
Here you go.
You'd better do as you're told,
Jonathan. That's all I have to say.
You threatening me?
Don't be here when I come back.
You won't be back, Johnny boy...
Don't try to frighten me,
Daphne. You don't know how.
Look...
You go tell them people that I'm going to Tokyo and you're not, huh?
- You tell 'em.
- No!
Ciao.
Teller.
Make sure my gear gets to the track in Tokyo.
I'm gonna travel with the team this trip.
You call transportation and tell them.
Yes, sir.
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!
What chance does Houston have of defeating Tokyo tonight?
Well, both teams have fine players and different styles.
What do you say, Moonpie?
Well, yeah, yeah, but...
But it's not an even match, see.
'Cause the Tokyo team has all these little short guys.
Tokyo! Tokyo!
Tokyo! Tokyo!
What about the rule changes?
Well...
At Houston, we kind of play a wide-open system.
Will you comment, though, about playing in a game where the rules are always changing?
Game's always had rule changes.
They don't affect the good teams.
You're a great new player.
What's the secret of your success on the track?
Oh, it's no secret.
I just imitate him.
And plastic surgery keeps me beautiful.
There are rumors that the last game of the season will be played without time limit.
Any comments?
Well, I don't think it'll come to that. It's still a game.
There also are rumors, some say you're retiring from the game.
Here I am.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!
Corporate society was an inevitable destiny.
A material dream world.
Everything man touched became attainable.
Yeah. I've been touched all my life.
One way or the other.
Either caressed or hit.
It don't like seem to matter which anymore.
I guess that's why I wanna see Ella again.
See if I still feel things now.
You know what I mean?
Yeah...
Here are some other things, too.
I mean, they took
Ella away from me.
Now, they're trying to push me out.
And I'd sure like to find out why.
I think I'll go to one of them computer centers.
See what I can find out.
Yeah.
Finding out things, it's...
That's the thing, Moonpie.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Tokyo.
And tonight's dramatic semifinal match for the World's Rollerball
Championship between host Tokyo and the high-flying defending champions from Houston.
Late rule changes tonight will be no penalties called, and there is limited substitution.
Ladies and gentlemen, will you stand, please, for the playing of our corporate hymn.
Tokyo! Tokyo!
Game controller for tonight's game, C. C. Nakamura.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Just wanna get out there and hit them little fellas.
Listen, stay close now, all right?
Yeah.
Okay, Johnny, let's go! Let's go!
Attention. Your attention, please.
Rule changes for tonight's game.
Limited substitution and no penalties.
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!
Tokyo! Victory!
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!
The controller checks the computer.
Ready to fire the first ball, and the first ball is fired. The game is underway!
Remember again, there'll be no penalties called tonight and limited substitutions.
This promises to be a punishing game for both teams tonight.
- Here they come!
- Let's wrap around.
Spread! Spread around!
All right, boys. Go ahead.
Watch out!
Stick him! Stick him!
Tokyo! Victory!
Stay close, now, stay close.
Stick with him!
Take it! Take it in!
Go! Go! Go!
It's a scramble in front of the goal.
They all go down. Kogo won it, and he scores!
Kogo scores, shooting from his kneeling position in front of the goal.
And Tokyo takes a one-to-nothing lead over Houston.
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!
With Tokyo leading one to nothing.
Houston being pressured by the fastest opening game.
The second ball is fired.
Spread.
Look out!
Spread out!
Tight defense!
Move ahead, Pete!
Move it.
No doubt the faster tactics of the Tokyo team.
And now, Houston, their bikers and skaters form a wall.
Tokyo! Victory!
- Hold 'em. Fast now.
- Pull out their hair.
Move it!
Watch the ball!
Jam them out of there!
Hold 'em!
Get 'em!
Watch him!
Bike him! Bike him!
Bike him! Bike him!
You got it, baby! You got it!
The ball is fired, and the second period is underway, with Tokyo leading one-to-nothing.
Houston forced to come from behind tonight.
Are you all set up?
Watch the men behind me.
Watch the men behind me.
The ball is in play.
And it's grabbed by
Carter for Houston.
Houston on the offensive attack.
Whoo!
Whoo!
What more have you got? Come on!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Go! Let's go!
Right at the slot. Free man, and he scores!
Houston goal scored by Jonathan E.
The time, 12:05, second period.
I love this game!
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!
Grab on there! Grab on there! Yeah!
Some injuries here as three players are helped off the track.
Spread!
Yeah! Right!
Come on, Moonpie! Moonpie!
Over here! Over here!
What the hell are those guys doing?
I don't know. Come on. Stay close.
I told you stay close.
All right. Turn 'em loose next time around, all right?
- All right. Go on.
- Yeah.
Go on. Go on. Go on! Come on!
Moonpie!
I got him. I got him.
Let me have him.
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!
Medic.
Everything'll be all right.
Come on. Just sit down over here.
Sit right here.
Everything'll be all right.
Medic! Hey, medic! Come over here!
Come on.
Moonpie!
Come on, Moonpie.
Come on, get some help!
Set him down. Set him down.
Where's oxygen?
Come on, Tokyo! Go and get them!
Go! Go! Go, Tokyo!
Okay, now come on, now!
Jonathan, watch yourself out there.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Take me high, Blue.
Tokyo! Victory!
Look out!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan E.
Time in the third period...
Spread! Spread! Go kill 'em!
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!
Fall out! Fall out!
Blue.
This way, please.
May I say first, please, that you played a superb game in our city.
Thank you.
A simple problem, yet I know it is difficult for you.
Your teammate has no family we can contact, and permission is required now before consummating matters.
So he's technically dead?
Yes, unfortunately.
His heart and lungs will function, but his brain is...
It has expired.
From the first minutes we had him, it was hopeless.
I believe this was explained to you.
He's warm.
Yes.
But if you will, please. You must sign a release form. It is required.
Does he...
Does he dream?
No. There is no brain wave at all.
No sort of consciousness.
Just a deep coma.
A vegetable.
No dreams. Nothing.
Well, even...
A plant feels something.
Who can say? Please.
It...
Senses life. I mean, it turns towards the sun.
It's alive, isn't it?
You must sign.
You...
You just leave him the way he is.
Just leave him as he is.
Someone will have to sign.
There's no other way.
Arrangements will be made.
Please. There are hospital rules that have to be...
No, there aren't.
There aren't any rules at all.
Let me know if you have any problems.
You won't find any answers in Geneva.
Take care of your arm.
In my opinion, we are confronted here with something of a situation.
Otherwise, I would not have presumed to take up your time.
Once again, it concerns the case of Jonathan E.
We know we don't want anything extraordinary to happen to Jonathan.
We already agreed on that.
No accidents, nothing unnatural.
The game was created to demonstrate the futility of individual effort.
Let the game do its work.
If the Energy Corporation has done all it can and if a champion defeats the meaning for which the game was designed, then he must lose.
I hope you agree with my reasoning.
Thank you, all.
Will you follow me, please?
Hello, hello!
Yes, it is the famous Jonathan E.
Oh, hard to believe.
Sorry we've never met.
The Rollerball Champion.
Wonderful.
Not many people come to see us, you know.
We're not easy to talk to, Zero and I.
We're a little confused again in here today.
This is embarrassing.
It's embarrassing to misplace things.
Misplacing data?
Mmm. The whole of the 13th century.
Misplaced the computers, several conventional computers.
We can't find them.
We're always moving things around, getting organized.
My assistants and I.
But this, this is Zero's fault.
Zero. He's the world's file cabinet.
Eh, pity. Poor old 13th century.
Well, come along now.
You want to get started, don't you?
- Yes, sir.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh.
- Hmm?
This way.
Now...
But we've lost those computers with all of the 13th century in them.
Not much in the century, just Dante and a few corrupt Popes, but it's so distracting and annoying.
You've unlimited restrictions here, of course.
You have to come so, so many times.
It all takes such... Such effort.
Do the executives still come here?
Oh, they used to, some of them.
What about the books?
Books? Books? Oh, no, they're all changed, all transcribed, all information's here.
I mean, Zero, of course. He's the central brain, the world's brain.
Fluid mechanics, fluidics.
He's liquid, you see.
He's water to touch.
All knowledge.
Everything we ask has become so, ah, so complicated now.
Each thing we ask...
This morning, we wanted to know something about the 13th century.
He flows out into all our storage systems.
He considers everything.
He's become so ambiguous now.
As if he knows nothing at all.
Could you tell me something about the corporate wars?
Wars? Wars?
Oh, yes, of course, we have them all here.
Punic War, Prussian
War, Peloponnesian War.
Crimean War, Wars of the Roses.
One doesn't perhaps recall them in sequence, but corporate wars.
Well, Zero will or can, I'm sure, tell you anything.
A memory pool, you see.
He's supposed to tell us where things are and what they might possibly mean.
Look, Zero, a visitor.
Jonathan E., the Rollerball Champion.
You've filed away a lot of data on him.
Do you remember?
Does it answer you?
Oh, yes. He speaks.
He finds things.
And loses them, and confuses itself.
Ask anything.
He'll find it for you.
A section on Bach...
Won't you, Zero?
All right. I'd like...
I'd like some information about corporate decisions.
How they're made and who makes them.
Zero...
You heard the question.
Answer him.
Negative.
You don't have to give him a full political briefing.
Answer.
Negative.
This is Jonathan E.
He has to know.
Make it simple.
Answer.
Corporate decisions are made by corporate executives.
Corporate executives make...
I know we have the answers.
We do have. They're the waters of history.
Energy equals genius...
I don't want to bully you.
Genius is energy.
Corporate entities control...
I shall have to answer!
Of economic life, technology, capital, labor, and markets.
Corporate decisions are made...
You have to, Zero.
Let's show him policy.
Negative. Negative.
Negative. Negative.
Negative. Negative.
Negative. Negative.
Hello, Johnny.
Morning, Ella.
Nervous.
How are you?
I'm... I'm all right, I guess.
What are you doing?
Looking at you.
Counting your scars.
Yeah.
Seeing how you've changed.
Oh, I mean, that's...
That's all I've changed, huh?
Just a little more beat up.
Oh, no.
You're just not...
Yeah, well...
Come on.
You want a drink or something?
No, thank you.
You have a lovely place.
Well, thank you.
Well, I've seen your house.
You have?
Yeah. When we, uh, played in Rome,
I stood a block away and watched your front gate for a couple hours.
I was just, uh, standing there wondering what your furniture looked like.
What you said to each other in the morning.
Yeah.
What's he like? What's he do?
Oh, he's a city engineer.
Ah.
We have a jet copter.
A son.
Two cats, and a place in the Alps.
Well, you don't really want hear all of this.
Son, huh?
Yes.
We have a lot of friends.
And he has a lover.
We have furniture a lot like yours.
Same taste in furniture, how about that?
Yes.
You know, Johnny.
All they want is a kind of incidental control over just a part of our lives.
I mean, they have control economically and politically, but they also provide.
You know they do.
Provide, huh?
You know, they were responsible for taking you away.
And I started to hate 'em.
They weren't.
It was the game, Johnny.
I mean, it was important to you.
It was as if I wasn't even there.
You played. There was nothing else.
I'm sorry.
You know I wanted you here.
I mean...
This might sound all wrong, but,
I mean, I was just trying to remember myself then.
Yeah.
Maybe it was love I wanted to try to remember.
There's, uh, a lot of things I want to talk to you about.
Yeah.
I've been thinking, Ella.
Been thinking a lot.
And watching.
It's like people who had a choice long time ago between having all them nice things or their freedom.
Of course, they, uh, chose comfort.
But comfort is freedom.
It always has been.
The whole history of civilization is a struggle against poverty and need.
No. No, that... That's not it.
That's never been it.
I mean, them privileges just buy us off.
Look.
They want me to quit, Ella.
Then quit.
Just like that, huh?
But you've got to do it now.
You've got to before it's too late.
Whether you want to or not.
Look, Johnny, the next game there won't be any substitutions allowed.
And no time limit.
You'll die, Johnny.
Everybody will die.
No time limit. They tell you that?
Yes.
They tell you to come here and convince me to quit?
Yes, but that isn't why I came here.
You have to get out for your own sake.
Oh, please, Johnny, please.
They tell you to stay if I did quit?
You my big reward?
You still don't understand why I came here.
You're the only person I ever wanted.
I wanted you on my side, that's all.
It's like you're a God now.
Maybe you know what I don't.
I...
I've been so stupid for so long.
I've been so stubborn.
I don't even know why.
It scares me.
You know, I'm probably gonna...
Probably gonna die.
And you'll be in here pumping away long after I'm gone.
Hey, you...
You got it made, old buddy.
Bluebonnets and everything.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Houston! Houston! Houston! Houston!

Rule changes for tonight's
World Championship game.
No substitutions, no penalties, and no time limit.
All right, watch it now. He's got the ball, next time around we defend.
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!
Houston! Houston! Houston! Houston!
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!
Come on! Come on, get out of there!
Get him up!
He did it!
All right. That's right, get him in the elevator.
Get off the rail!
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!
- Come on!
- We gotta get him off the track.
I don't want another man on that track!
Houston, what the hell are you trying to do?
Nobody's gonna win this game!
Game? This wasn't meant to be a game!
Never!
- Jonathan! Jonathan!
- Houston! Houston!
Watch his leg. Watch that leg. Easy, easy.
Let me have him. Let me have him! Let me have him!
Move out. Move out.
Jonathan.

Jonathan.
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan!
Jonathan!
Come on, Mike!
- Hello, good people!
- Hi, there!
You better all grab your courage everybody, 'cause this is flyin' weather.
Now, I'm talkin' $5 for the best five minutes of your lives.
And when you die and Saint Peter says to you,
"Hey, when were you happiest down there?"
You're gonna say, "Well, it was
OK the day I got married,
"and I didn't much mind the day I first fell in love,
"but seeing the sky with the Great
Waldo Pepper, that beats 'em all!"
- But first, first, who wants a free ride?
- Me! Me!
Well, boy, usually I try to pick somebody that shows more enthusiasm.
But in your case, I'll make an exception. What's your name?
- Scooter.
- Scooter!
You look big and strong to me,
Scooter and that's the main thing.
I'm gonna need a lot of gas.
I can tell there's a lot of riders here today.
I tell you what, take this to the nearest gas station every time I need it.
When we're all done, at the end of the day, I'll give you a free ride, how's that?
- OK.
- Attaboy!
OK, folks, if you'll just step right up here now, let's go!
Praise the Lord!
- Go ahead, get in.
- But what if I don't like it?
If you really hate it, I'll give you a second ride free. Go on. Go ahead.
OK.
Attaboy, Scooter. Keep it comin'.
- No, no, no. I've changed my mind.
- Oh, no, no, it's OK. No, no, go ahead.
Yes, sir, now who do we have here?
OK, Scooter.
Thanks.
What about my free ride?
Oh, I just... I just told you that to get you to work for me. I never take kids up alone.
You must've done pretty good today, if what Scooter's says right.
Yes, sir. Best in over a year.
Right after the war finished, barn storming was like this all the time.
I've been flying Nebraska for quite a while now.
Ah, things are sure getting tough. I guess people are just gettin' used to airplanes.
That's your plan for the rest of your life, just cash for rides? That's it?
Oh, no, no, sir. Every penny I make, goes into building a brand new biplane for air acrobatics.
- Are you the best flyer in the world?
- Hush, Scooter.
Wouldn't I like to be!
But there's so many amazing pilots are around that've done and so many incredible feats with their airplanes.
Sorry to disappoint you, Scooter, but I'm gonna be honest with you.
There's just no way that I could say
I'm the best pilot in the world.
I'm the second best flyer in the world.
Who's better?
In the first place, I'd have to put the German ace Ernst Kessler.
He shot down 70 planes and lived to tell the tale.
That don't seem right.
Shootin' down Americans, that don't make a man hero to me.
Well, maybe not, but, Kessler was special.
An honest day's work is what I call special.
Were you in the war?
- In the last part of it.
- Did you fight Kessler?
Once.
We were flying patrol over the Hurtgen wood.
There were five of us, and we saw Kessler flying below us... with one escort plane.
Now, he didn't see us, and we dove on him.
Now, on the first pass, we shot down the escort plane, but Kessler was too fast.
I followed the escort plane all the way down, just to make sure he was finished.
As I started climbing back up, well,
I said to myself, with those odds,
"Kessler will make a run for it". But he didn't.
He took 'em all on. One against four.
And he was doing the attacking!
By the time I got back up,
- he'd shot down three of 'em.
- How?
Well, Landis and Swaab were kids and...
Let's see, Curtin, well, Curtin couldn't have been more than 19. Well, they panicked.
By the time I got back up, he was after McKinnon.
He shot a burst into him, and
Mac's plane caught on fire.
Now, Mac said that he would never, ever go down in flames, so he jumped.
- Didn't he have a parachute?
- Nobody had parachutes then, Scooter.
No, he just would rather fall to his death and... than burn going down.
- And then Kessler dove in on me.
- Weren't you scared?
- Don't be dumb.
- Well, it's crazy, but... I was happy.
It was just me against him.
God, he was all over the sky!
He could snap around the head of a pin. One minute I'd think I had him.
The next, he's comin' right at me.
And then, I don't know, he was behind me, and my guns jammed.
I pounded on the handles and just pounded on them until my fists were bleeding.
But I couldn't unjam them.
I was just there. I was just...
I was helpless in his gun sights.
But he didn't fire.
He could see me pounding on my guns, and he pulls up alongside of me. Just like...  just as close as you are to me.
And he looks at me.
- And he did it.
- Did what?
Saluted.
Just like that.
Over the Hurtgen wood,
Ernst Kessler saluted me.
And then he peeled off... and dove back towards his lines.
I can take you folks high or low, fast or slow, anyway you want to go.
And I can land you as soft as an old maid getting into her feather bed.
And I can fly over your... your house so you can see who's visiting your wife!
- But first, for the bravest of the brave...
- Look there! Look at him!
All right, folks, never mind. He's just passing through. Passing through.
Now, for the bravest of the brave,
I'll do some stunts first for free.
Look!
Excuse me, folks. A fellow lover of the blue may be in trouble.
I'll be right back.
Hello, good people! Thank you. Thank you.
Before we get started, son, I want you to know
I consider your presence here an act of aggression.
Aggression? This is my territory.
Smile, don! we don't want to disconcert the masses.
- Then fly your crate the hell outta here.
- For what conceivable reason?
Nebraska's mine. I've been working it for 2 years.
Friend, you just got yourself a new partner.
But these people are mine.
- Then you're not leavin'?
- You grasp things very well, I can see that.
But don't you leave, either. If you carry my gas can into town for me,
I'll give you a free lesson at the end of the day.
Judging from that landing, you need all the help you can get!
Forgive the intrusion, good folks!
Now, let's remind ourselves where we were.
Some people would say that what you're about to see is probably the greatest exhibition of aeronautical skill in history the world.
I myself wouldn't go that far.
It is probably only the greatest since the invention of the airplane.
Now, this'll be the order, folks.
First, the falling leaf, then the barrel roll, then an inside loop.
And finally a daring low-level pass.
- There he goes.
- Son?
Son?
Oh! I'd be obliged if you'd prop me, son.
- Glad to.
- You're a good loser, and I like good losers.
Then again, you've probably had lots of practice.
- Contact.
- Contact.
Little change in the programme, folks.
My partner and I have a little surprise planned for you folks.
How would you all like to see the famous Axel Olsson crash?
The pond! The pond's the safest place, Axel!
That's his signal, folks.
Means he's just rarin' to go.
Everybody down to the pond.
Everybody, everybody, the thing of it is, it really makes Axel feels appreciated if, when he's done, assuming he's alive, there's a little reward waiting.
In Wichita, folks gave $15, $20 to see a crash like this, up close.
But you all decide, whatever you like, I'll take it. Thank you kindly. Thank you.
They love it, Axel! They're good people!
Now down to the pond, everybody!
That's the best spot to see it from. Thank you.
Be sure and give the captain a nice round of applause when he's finished.
It just means the world to him, knowing you care.
Hey, you! Come back here!
Come back here!
That was a mistake.
- What?
- He shouldn't have taken off his gun.
- Why not?
- Arabs behind those rocks.
- You like movies?
- Hmm, if the clothes is nice.
- Is this your sweater?
- Uh-huh.
- No, no!
- Don't worry. Don't worry.
- You know what I'd do if I was him?
- What?
Throw sand in their eyes, blind 'em.
And you could tell it was Kessler, because he had a black and yellow plane.
It had three wings and looked like a wasp.
- Oh, that could sting you, you mean?
- And he had...
Right. And he the name of his girlfriend,
Lola, painted along the side of the plane.
- Honest?
- Yeah.
Oh, that would've been the highlight of my life would be to see my very own name
flyin' through the...
Oh, there's Axel. Hi, Axel! My goodness, he's hurt himself again. Poor thing.
- Hi, honey.
- Axel, what happened to you?
- Oh, it's a long story.
- Oh, don't tell me. I'll be too upset.
I want you to meet a friend of mine, now. He's a pilot, too. and he's been telling me one exciting things after another.
Waldo, this is Axel. Axel, this is Waldo Pepper.
- Smile, son. Never disconcert the masses.
- Oh, oh, why don't you sit down, dear?
Oh, I can't hardly believe it.
Me sittin' here with two aces.
Well, why don't you tell him about when you fighting the black and yellow German!
No, no, he wasn't... he wasn't black and yellow, Mary Beth. His plane was.
That's right. And... and it had "Lola" written on it.
- Lola was Kessler's truest love.
- Ernst Kessler?
You fought Ernst Kessler?
He sure did. And was it ever exciting. Just wait 'til you hear it. Go ahead, tell him,
- Waldo.
- Oh, no.
- Later. Later, maybe.
- No, please.
- No.
- Do it, Waldo.
Kessler could have killed Waldo, but he let him go on account of Waldo's guns jammed.
When Kessler and Waldo tangled,
Kessler had such respect for Waldo,
that he just gave him a salute, and off he went.
- That must've been some thrill.
- Uh, well, it went by so fast.
But looking back on it, I guess I'd have to say it was kind of exciting.
Oh, he's just bein' modest, Axel.
That was very dangerous thing.
That German had shot down four planes before Waldo could stop him.
Landis, Swaab, Curtin, McKinnon.
Right, and...
How did you know?
Because they were with me in the 14th Scouts, Mary Beth.
And when they took off that morning, I didn't see any Waldo Pepper taking off with them.
You didn't?
There were five of them in the flight.
Kessler shot down four, but let the flight leader live.
His name was Captain Frank Madden. He died in combat only a couple of months later.
I don't get it.
You're sitting here with a four-flusher, Mary Beth.
He's been telling you stories, getting you drunk, so he can work his way with you.
Come on.
It should've been me.
Ladies and gentlemen...
It is my pleasure, as the head of the Dillhoefer Flying Circus,
to present to you, on his first and his foremost
and his final tour of America, the greatest flyer, the most courageous ace of aces,
the most foolhardy aerial stunt performer
in this entire civilised world. the black knight of Germany, Ernst Kessler!
Goddamn Kraut!
All right. now!
He's made his turn out there, ladies and gentlemen.
And now, he's coming back. so keep your eyes on him.
- He's about to perform...
- Mom, may I... thank you...
- a spectacular victory roll!
- Thank you.
- What are you doin' here? Ezra?
- It's gonna be a monoplane.
- Here he comes, now, gaining speed vertically.
- A monoplane?
You mean to tell me you're building me a plane with only one wing?
Oh, I thought you'd like to know, the biplane is as dead as a dodo bird.
And now he comes, gaining speed. pulling up!
And there it is, it's a roll going straight up into the heavens.
And now he comes out of it on the top.
In case you hadn't noticed,
Ezra, that was a biplane.
- Exactly, it's an antique.
- Another death-defying manoeuvre!
- Monoplanes fall apart.
- Mine is cantilevered, it can't fall apart.
- They can't pull high Gs.
- Absolutely untrue!
It's unstable, they're unmanoeuvrable and...
- And they can't do that.
- When we were 10, who built a glider that flew a 176 feet
- off the top of the Johnson barn?
- You did.
And who busted his butt jumping out of a second story window with a parachute made of bed sheets?
- I did.
- Then don't lecture me on aerodynamics.
- Was I lecturing you?
- You were.
He's going now for altitude, ladies and gentlemen...
- That means...
- It really is a brilliant concept, Waldo.
- Wait a minute. Let go of that.
- Okay. Now, here's something to
remember to tell your grandchildren.
At an altitude of 3,000 feet, the only man alive today to do ten full, complete revolutions without a crash... the death spin of Ernst Kessler!
Now, look, Waldo, you're worried about manoeuvrability...
- Look at the size of that aileron...
- Shut up!
- Four!
- Five!
Six!
- Seven! Eight!
- Hurry up! You're running out of room.
Nine!
Ten!
- He is the best, isn't he?
- You can beat him, Waldo.
In my monoplane.
Here he is, folks. He's coming in to land.
The greatest aviator in the world. Ernst Kessler!
Ladies and gentlemen, a short intermission, during which time, for a nominal fee...
- Have you test flown it yet?
- As soon as it gets an engine.
I got a line on a surplus
Liberty. All it takes is money.
- Here, I got lucky last week.
- Then, that'll do for a down payment.
- Don't worry. I'll get more.
- All right.
- Mr. Dillhoefer.
- Yeah.
I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Waldo Pepper.
Please to meet you, Pepper, but the answer is no.
- I thought we might discuss...
- The answer's still no.
- Look.
- Look.
I know who you are. You're a damn good pilot, right?
- Right.
- But barnstorming ain't what it used to be, so now you want a job in my Flying Circus.
But do you got an act? No! Right?
Well, the answer's no unless you got an act. Look up there!
Do you think that pack of jackals want to see a good pilot?
They want blood.
Sudden death is my business,
Pepper, not good pilots.
Wait a sec, give me a chance, would you please?
I'll give you the same deal
I give everybody else.
Now, I'm gonna lose the Kraut to a western outfit at the end of this month.
That means, there's an act free.
Now, you dream up a stunt where people think you're gonna die. No!
Where people are sure you'll gonna die, and I'll take you on.
You might try wing-walking. I hear it's very popular down south.
Good luck!
Yoo-hoo! Hey! Yoo-hoo!
Hey, Waldo, how you doin'?
Well, it's an inferior model, but it'll suit my purposes.
- What do you mean?
- I'm borrowing your plane, son.
- What?
- Yup. You wrecked mine, remember?
- And it won't be ready for a month.
- Hey, hey, take your hands off that!
Dillhoefer's promised me employment provided I come up with an act, so I'm using your plane to improvise with.
You're not using my plane for anything.
Seems the least you can do for someone who was in combat while you were sitting it out.
I was in combat with the 6th
Pursuit in the Calais sector.
And the only reason I got there late was because they made me an instructor
- at the time, and I couldn't get away.
- Son.
Son. I'm not a vindictive man.
You learned your lesson the other night, and there's no need for you to apologize.
- Who's apologizing?
- You're both starvin'!
Well, you are, practically!
So, why don't you just try helpin' each other?
Well, what the hell would we do, anyway?
You're half crippled. My engine's givin' me fits.
Actually, I have some ideas on the subject. Mary Beth, can you drive?
- What?
- Can you drive?
Oh...
Why?
- Go straight, Mary Beth!
- Got it. Goin' straight.
- To the left!
- You want me to go to the left?
- No, you go straight!
- Not me.
- Slow down!
- You want me to slow down?
- Now go faster!
- Faster, OK!
- Right!
- What?
Right. Turn it to the right! wait, you go straight!
To the left! what the hell are you doing?
- Well, you told me to go faster! You want me...
- Not you, you're fine.
Here! Here! Here!
- You got to slow it down.
- I can't, I'll stall out if I go any slower.
No, you won't. Just come across the field, go as steady as you can and as slow as you can and we'll adjust to you.
- OK.
- I hope I don't ruin everything.
Don't worry, Mary Beth, we're doin' a great stunt!
I don't want to be a stickler for accuracy, but you're just flying.
She's just driving. I'm the one doing a great stunt.
That's true, son, and that's why you're gettin' all the whole of glory.
- Up to the right.
- Okay, to the right.
- Get over.
- What?
- More!
- Oh... OK!
- Get over to the right!
- I'm going over.
- No, no, no, don't run over it!
- Oh, oh!
Faster, faster!
Come back here! Faster, Mary Beth!
- Oh, I'm going as fast as I can!
- More!
What?
- Waldo.
- Not now!
- Waldo!
- You're doing fine, Mary Beth!
- Just go straight.
- Waldo, I think you better listen to me.
Damn it, I said not now!
- Waldo!
- I got it!
- What about Maudie? You told her?
- No.
- Why not?
- My sister worries enough about you as it is.
- Need some help?
- No, I got it.
Go on, go on, it'll be OK. Go on, go on.
Ezra, if you want your lunch, it's waiting for you inside.
Guess who's home.
- You bastard! You rotten bastard!
- Hey!
Every time you come home, you do this!
You got some nerve! Get out!
Whoo!
I'm sorry, Waldo. I don't know what got into me.
I think it was seeing you all bandaged up again that did it.
Well, I never get to see you unless you're all banged up.
Still, I guess it's kind of mean to throw things at a crippled man.
I'm sorry, Waldo. I really am.
- Ow...!
- Oh. Oh.
Scratch my back and I'll forgive you.
What?
Scratch my back and I'll forgive you.
- OK?
- OK.
- Be careful.
- This itching is driving me nuts.
- There?
- No. Hi... higher.
- OK.
- Ahh! Yeah, yeah, ahh!
You're forgiven.
Waldo, is it always gonna be when something's broken?
My...my comin' back home, you mean?
Your comin' back home, I mean.
You could fly with me.
- Waldo, I get sick!
- You think, still?
At the last time I went up with you, all I saw was the inside of a paper sack the whole time.
Yeah, I guess.
Besides, I don't think it would look proper.
We could get married.
Well, think of all the pretty girls you'd be missing.
I... I'd try very hard to cut down. Really.
That's very sweet of you, but no thanks.
If I'd have married you, it would've been before you went off to war.
- You were awful cute in those days.
- I'm still awful cute!
And you practically promised me you'd get killed.
I know. I know.
Sorry about that.
Well, I guess you're still trying.
I really do love you, Maudie.
Except in flying weather!
Oh, Waldo.
Hey, Maudie...
Now you got to remember that this thing is so different and genius-like, that you might not think it's perfect; it is perfect, I'm not saying that.
But you might think it needs to be touched up here!
Oh, God damn, if you don't hurry up,
- I'm gonna call it off.
- Will you just hold on?
- Well, I haven't had a...
- We're moving, Ezra, as fast as we can.
I haven't had an unlimited budget, you know.
So, it's not gonna look like something out of a museum, all clean and dusted.
I'm a designer and I don't give a damn about clean.
And that's what's so unique about this plane. It's the design.
Concentrate on that. The design.
Well, there it is, the Stiles Skystreak!
Don't you think it might be a little nose-heavy, Ezra?
- Ah, uh-huh, here, here! Here it is!
- What?
An elevator trim tab you operate from inside the cockpit.
- What about the horse power?
Will it take a 120?
Well, if you send me the money for a 120, it'll take a 120.
Hell, it'll take a 180. Do you like it?
What about the wings with a 180?
I'll buttress them wires. I'll get an extra set of flying wires for the wings
Don't worry about the god damn wings!
- Do you like it?
- Ezra...
I could do an outside loop in this, couldn't I?
- Couldn't I?
- Of course you could.
Hell, even I could do an outside loop in this plane , but I'm a superb pilot!
- What's an outside loop?
- The last great stunt.
- Even Kessler hasn't done it.
- Why not?
He's never had a plane that could take the stress.
Do you realize if you build the first plane to do it, and I'm the first guy to fly it.
That we could both be very rich and very famous, do you think you'd just mind that, Ez?
- I need some more money.
- Oh! I'll get the money.
He likes it!
Any time you're ready.
Come on, now, look. We flipped and you lost.
You gotta go first.
We gotta find out if we can do this.
Dillhoefer won't give us a job unless we can wing-walk. Go on!
Come on back.
Get back in.
I didn't like it much!
All right, get back here and we'll switch.
Come on!
Hey, take the stick. Take the stick.
Now, what in the...! watch it!
Ladies and gentlemen!
The unbeaten, untied, unethical wing-walking wonders of the world,
Olsson and Pepper!
Guy came through here last week did that standing on his head.
Folks, I haye always had a warm spot in my heart for the lovely town of "Pauth".
- Poth!
- Poth.
And for your entertainment memories, we have a special guest.
who has agreed to take the first flight with us this afternoon.
Ladies and gentlemen, the world-famous opera star,
Madame Jessie Lund!
Folks, I always tell the boys
our annual sojourn to Great
Rapids is the climax of the year.
So just crowd right in! Just crowd right in!
Excuse me for a moment.
Well? Is she gonna help us out or not? Yes or no?
No! It's too dangerous.
Well, we need new stunts. Where's the hell is this outside loop of yours?
The plane'll be ready by the Muncie fair.
That's several weeks from now, we could starve by then.
We need something to bide us through.
- Duke, I'm going to make you legendary.
- I've been legendary all month, Doc.
All right, then I'll make you unprecedented!
- I could go roller skating on the wing.
- It's no good. Gates done that this season.
Okay, Doc. How about if I parachute off and then play the harmonica on the way down?
It's no good. Gates done it and tuted a flute.
- What the hell do you want, Doc?
- Sex!
That's what's gonna pull us through.
Well, I am all the time, sayin' how I just crave adventure.
- Then it's yes?
- Honey! Don't let him bully you into doing something you don't want to do.
Oh, she's gonna do it! She's gonna pull us through. All right now, here's what we do.
- We put her on the wing...
- Yeah. And she'll fake bein' afraid.
- Right.
- And the wind will blow her clothes off.
- Yeah.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Wait, why would the wind blow her clothes off?
When I'm wing-walking, the wind doesn't blow my clothes off.
Nobody wants to see you with your clothes off!
Her, they'll come runnin' to see what happens, if... if you know what I mean.
A good gimmick! We'll just shred her clothe beforehand, and you're a good girl.
- I get to pick the clothes.
- What was that, honey?
And I get to pick the words you're gonna use about me on the sign.
I want my name higher than anybody else's and I want my name bigger than anybody's.
Let's see. I want to be the "It" girl of the skies! That's what I'll be.
- No, no, that isn't so good.
- Stop her, Doc.
Nobody's gonna stop me, Buster Brown!
Now, this is what you're gonna write.
Now!
I want it higher than anybody's and bigger than anybody else's name on the sign.
Go ahead. "Fabulous, fantastic Mary Beth
McIllhenny, the "It" girl of the skies!"
All right. All right!
OK!
Now, honey, now!
Help me! Somebody, help me, please!
Please, help me! Somebody, please help me!
Help me! Oh, God! Somebody, help me! Please, help me!
Help me, somebody! Please, help me!
Help me! Oh, oh, my God! Axel! Axel!
They're coming out! Terrific, honey!
You can come back now!
OK, come back now!
You don't want to go and freeze on me, do you?
Come on in before you catch a cold!
Mary Beth!
This is work to get it up.
Hey, they're coming back.
Hey, what the hell's he trying to do?
He can't land with her out there. He'll cartwheel.
- She's frozen. Come on!
- I knew she wasn't worth top billing.
Move!
- Contact.
- Contact.
- What are they doin'?
- How the hell do I know what they're doin'?
They don't know what they're doing!
We're both gonna die if you stay out there!
Please!
Crawl to the centre and get out of there!
Mary Beth!
Jesus!
I'm going across.
I can't keep it level with both of you out there.
- Put it into a shallow dive.
- OK!
Mary Beth, I'm gonna help you!
Here, take my hand! I'm gonna help you back, Mary Beth!
Take my hand! Mary Beth!
Take it! Take my hand!
No!
Jesus!
- You'll notify her family?
- Oh, yes, sir, we know exactly what to do.
Don't worry about that.
Ah, I hate to say this, but I am in the business, and uh...
...an accident like this does bring the people out, so if you'll just excuse us.
Nobody's going no place unless he says so.
Unless who says so?
I almost had her.
Jesus, I came so close.
In here.
Hey, Newt.
- Hey, hotshot, how are ya?
- What do you say?
Gee... uh...
Uh, Newt, this is Doc Dillhoefer and my partner, Axel Olsson.
Hey, you guys, this is Newton Potts.
- He was my squadron leader in France.
- What are you doin' here?
- You know, he got 11 planes, Doc?
- Oh, I've heard a lot about Mr. Potts.
What... what brings you down here?
Ehmm.... you do, Mr. Dillhoefer.
I'm the Regional Air Inspector here for the Department of Commerce.
- I'm afraid I'm gonna have to shut you down.
- What?
- On who the hell's authority?
- The Air Commerce Act.
Your air circus is operating in direct violation of the civil aeronautics code.
Hey, come off it, Newt. What you ta...
- What is all this?
- The fun and games are over, Waldo.
You guys been scaring the hell out of people for too long.
Flying is getting to be big business, and people gotta figure it's safe.
You think you come here and wave a couple of papers and ruin our livelihood just like that.
You meet the requirements in here and you can fly again.
But your planes have to be licensed, your pilots licensed.
No stunting over congested areas, no wing-walking.
It's all in there.
When you're ready for inspection, let me know and I'll come back.
But until then, you're grounded.
Gee, you think... do you think if I study real hard, Newt I might pass?
Are... are you gonna license the clouds and the rain?
You gonna put highways in the sky for people to follow?
Yep. All that, too.
Along with airlines and airmail, and there's gonna be big money in it too, if you're smart.
Well, I'm no chauffeur, and I'm no mailman.
- I'm a flyer, Newt.
- I'm afraid not anymore, Waldo.
Not until an investigation has been held into the death of that girl.
Waldo and Axel wanted to save her.
Then, that will come out in the investigation, but until then, everybody involved in the incident will not be issued licences.
And when's that gonna be?
The Regional board convenes in in Wichita 6 weeks.
Now listen, I've got a contract with the Muncie
Fair in two weeks. I need Waldo and Axel to fly!
- You can't do this to me!
- I've got nothin' to do with it.
It's Congress and you guys!
You done it to yourselves.
Why don't you all grow up?
Waldo, you're the greatest natural flyer I've ever seen in my life.
If the war had gone on a little longer, you might have proved that to everyone.
But that kind of flying is finished.
You'll have to learn to live with it.
I'm sorry, hotshot.
Dillhoefer, I'll be in touch.
I just don't understand.
That guy, was a great squadron leader.
What the hell happens to people?
- Kid's stuff.
- What does it say?
Not this.
Us.
What we've been doin'.
- Waldo, he's right. It's kid's stuff.
- Now, come on. We can still fly the Muncie Fair.
Now, don't worry about Newt, he's an old pal. He'll come around.
I'm through, Waldo.
My heart isn't in it.
See you.
You take care.
Come on! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Ladies and gentlemen, step right up!
For 25 cents see the next show.
The next show starts in about five minutes.
25 cents!
Step right up, folks. Come one, come all.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a show of a lifetime.
Step right up!
Do I fly? Or am I finished?
Neither. I fly.
Look, Waldo, Newt said you'd already asked him three times.
He can't let ya.
Somebody's gonna do the outside loop any day now.
If I can do it here, now, you'll still have the plane later on.
He says you might be able to get away with two-month suspension.
You can take it to exhibitions all over the country, follow Kessler around and show him up.
- All I did was try and save her.
- I... I... I know.
Newt's gotta go by the rules. Half the local CAA is sitting out there.
CAA!
Waldo... we've been together all our lives.
Tell me to fly it and I'll fly it.
Tell me to skip it and I'll skip it.
But I gotta know now.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.
- Are you sure you're ready?
- Yeah!
Down from the heavens, all for you...
...the Stiles Skystreak!
Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in the history of aviation, the most difficult, the most dangerous aerobatic manoeuvre ever performed in the entire world...
Mr. Ezra Stiles will now perform the outside loop!
He's over the top now. folks, and into his dive at 200 miles an hour.
And now he's coming out of the dive upside down.
and centrifugal force is trying to throw him out of the cockpit.
Power on. Power on! Late!
Tremendous pressure's are driving the blood to his head.
He could black out any second.
Oh, he's trying to push over the top and make history here for you today.
It's all right. folks. He's under control.
- He's not gonna make it.
- He'll make it.
Well, if he don't we'll go right into the opera singer routine.
- Duke, get into the opera costume.
- He'll make it.
Get the plane ready.
Don't let it hang there.
Piece of cake, Ezra!
Pull back. That's it! That's it!
Now power! Now power!
Don't let it slide back. Don't let it slide back. Jesus, don't let it slide back!
Go back! Go back! Go back! Go back you!
Ace, get that goddamn plane started! Go back!
Listen. Let me... let me get the belt.
Can you move your legs?
Can you move your legs?
- Not much.
- Well, try.
They're jammed.
Son of a bitch.
- Hey, one of you guys give me a hand, will ya?
- Oh, Christ!
Waldo! They're smoking! They're smoking!
- Waldo!
- Hey! Put that away, goddamn it!
Put those cigarettes away!
Get 'em away from the plane! Damn it!
- Get 'em away!
- Fire! Fire!
Don't let me burn! Waldo!
- Somebody give me a hand! Quick!
- Please! Help me!
Come on, help me. Don't just stand there.
- Will somebody help me?
- Don't let me burn!
- Help me get him out!
- Don't let me burn! Waldo!
Waldo, I'm burning! I'm burning! Waldo!
Get away! Get away fro...!
Get away from here, you goddamn vultures!
Get away. Go on back! Go back! Go on! Get away!
Let's go! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Get away!
What the hell is he doin'?
Get away!
Hi, Newt. He's down by the tree.
It's permanent, Waldo.
The Regional Board met in wichita. Permanently grounded.
It's a federal offence if you ever fly again.
That means jail.
I put in my pitch for you. Did everything
I could, but they wouldn't budge.
It's a miracle no one was killed in that crash. If there had been...
...you would've of been up for manslaughter.
As it was, they figure they're letting you off easy.
Well, they did the right thing.
There's no doubt about it.
You can come work for me if you want. It's the best I can do.
It's clerkin', sure, but you'd still be in aviation.
No, thanks, Newt. Thanks, but no thanks.
Well, if you change your mind, let me know.
What do you think about Kessler?
- What?
- Doin' the outside loop, last week, in St Louis.
Well...
Somebody was bound to do it... sooner or later.
Yes, I suppose so.
- Take it easy, hotshot.
- Yeah.
Hey.
Who is it?
It's me, Doc. Waldo Pepper.
Goodbye!
Uh... just a minute, huh, Doc?
Howdy, Doc.
Oh, hey, you're lookin' good, Doc. Real good.
- What you been doin'?
- Get to it, Pepper.
Oh, nothing. I... I...
Well, I'm healing pretty fast, and...
I was thinkin' about maybe gettin' back into flying.
I can't advise you on that. You wanna go to jail, go to jail.
I'd use another name, of course, uh...
I wouldn't want star billing or anything.
With me?
You get me the worst publicity that a man could ever ask for.
You get me suspended for a year, and here you are now, asking me for a job.
Come on, Doc.
You're crazy.
Pepper, there's not an outfit in this whole part of this country that'll even touch ya!
Ah, it's all gone anyway.
They don't wanna see stunting anymore.
They want speed, records, fast, faster.
Get yourself a bug, hit 200, you're home free.
I... I can do that.
Goodbye, Pepper. Your friend Olsson's doin' pretty good in Hollywood.
Maybe the CAA hasn't set itself up in the west yet.
Try California.
CAA...
See you, Doc.
You're not a bad sort, Waldo, but you're dangerous.
- How's the pay?
- It's good.
The people are nutty, but you get used to them.
I haven't been out of work since I got here.
- Who do I see about getting a job?
- Don't worry about it.
Finish! Cut! Axel, move in. Come on, Axel.
- I'll be right back.
- Now, you'll be in that position over there.
All right, gentlemen. All right. Stand by, everybody!
Roll 'em!
Speed... Action!
Cut! You got that? OK for you?
OK, Joe? Good.
Cut! Print! That was a good one. Very good.
Let's just wait a minute, Frank. Just a minute.
I am just too cat-like to fall that way.
Every fan I have will know in his heart it simply isn't me. I have too much natural grace.
Couldn't he club me with a wrench or something like that?
- You know, my reflexes are so...
- Hey, you were great. That's a terrific fall.
Okay?
One more time, please. And Axel, will you use the gun butt on him this time.
Props, will you move the debris out of the way so the men can bring the table in.
- Well, you must be the famous Patsy.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Axel says I'm supposed to be real nice to you.
- You're damn right.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
Werfel asked me to give you a message.
- He wants you to reconsider.
- But I thought he had all his pilots.
Not after this morning.
Another mid-air?
We've been through that before. Tell him no.
I'm glad. I already did.
Hey, let's us do it.
You're talking to an airline pilot, son!
Western promised me an opening at the end of the month, once my application passes CAA review.
- Ah, who'd approve you?
- I'm clean.
I took my year's suspension.
You really wanna get thrown to the lions, huh?
It's a lot better than getting creamed by Fokker.
I can't do that kind of air work anymore, anyhow. I'm out of practice.
But we can work our way back.
I couldn't get the job myself, but Werfel knows you. You could vouch for me.
I'd even use an assumed name.
How about it?
Do you think we could?
God knows Werfel pays his pilots big.
All their next of kin agree on that.
These are the outtakes on that scene where Dick had that piece of bad luck.
Oh, Dick's gonna be all right, more or less, thank God.
And thank God we had two camera on it.
We got it from different angles, I think we can use the same one for both
Curtin's crash and Landis's as well.
I'm positive the audience will never notice they're the same crash.
Ah, that's supposed to be Madden's plane flying over, but I think...
I think we'll probably cut that part out.
And start him going up to help McKinnon.
Oh, here's the same crash from a different angle. You'll see what I mean.
Actually, Dick was lucky to get out of it alive.
He'll be in the hospital for at least a couple of months and no use to us.
All right, that's enough. Let's have some lights, please!
Now then, we've shot everything up to where
Madden comes back up to helps McKinnon.
And what I want to see McKinnon's plane flamed, see him jump to his death, and then the final dog-fight between Kessler and Madden.
- Think you can handle that?
- Yes, sir. No problem.
Hey, George! George. Mr. Werfel,
I'd like you to meet my partner, the famous George Brown from the East Coast.
- This is Mr. Werfel, the director.
- Excuse me, what is this picture?
It's called "Eagles Over France", about the 14th Air Scouts.
- That was Ernst Kessler's battle.
- Yes, that's right.
Yes, they flew against Kessler. It's all true.
True, no. You got it all wrong.
The 14th Scouts didn't have any Spads, and they didn't have Newports, or SC 5's.
Mr. Brown.
- There was a different insignia...
- Mr. Brown, anybody can supply accuracy.
- Artists provide truth.
- Mr. Werfel, I know this battle.
And they were stationed much closer to the front line.
There was no phony farm house.
He's quite right. It didn't look like that.
But then, perhaps, some poetic licence is justified.
You're learning.
Look here. You sure you can handle all these three stunts?
- Yes, Sir.
- They're very dangerous.
- We can do it.
- And how much is it gonna cost me?
- Depends.
- I'm on a very tight budget...
- You're Ernst Kessler, aren't you?
- Yes. And your name is Brown?
I'm sorry I went on about what an expert I was on your battle.
No. No need. You probably know more about it than I do.
I was there, of course, but uh, there wasn't much time for me to study.
- Well, anyway, I'm glad to be in your movie.
- Oh, it's hardly mine.
I am just a technical advisor.
They let me do my own flying.
Publicity, I suppose.
Aren't you playing yourself?
Ernst Kessler shot down 70 planes.
Now, if you were casting the part, who would you pick?
- I'd pick you.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.
It's all lies anyway, Mr. Brown.
Oh, uh, let's forget the Brown stuff. My name is Waldo Pepper.
You're Waldo Pepper?
You were a friend of Ezra Stiles.
And you were with him in Muncie, when he tried for the outside loop?
- You were in some trouble, yes?
- Yes.
It's over now?
No.
So, it's very nice to have met you.
Perhaps we'll have a chance to fly together, huh?
I'd like that.
- Goodbye, Mr. Brown.
- Goodbye.
- This is it.
- Yeah.
Well, have you got any sign notions of how to set this Goddamned thing on fire in mid-air and then jump clear without singeing your ass off?
Well, we'll see. Well, you know, we could...
Did you find out how much Werfel is gonna pay for this stunt?
Yeah. Five hundred.
Five hundred?
You mean, he's gonna pay me Five hundred dollars just to set this thing on fire and jump?
No, not you. He's paying me $500.
You're flying the Madden plane.
- What?
- You're flying the Madden plane.
- How do you know?
- Kessler talked to Werfel.
He said he wanted to do the dogfight with you.
You know, if I place a charge under the cowling,
and I run some wires back under the floor board to a switch here,
when I hit the switch, the smoke pot goes. when I jump clear, the plane will be goin'...
I was not spying.
I did not wish to be an intrusion.
So...
Tomorrow we do the McKinnon jump. who's doing it?
- I am.
- May I ask you why? There are other pilots.
Well, I'm 32 years old, I've been flying since I was 20 and I'm gettin' married.
Yeah, I'm gettin' married.
And they're paying me 500 bucks for this jump and that makes my total net worth $250.
I need the money.
Yes, I understand the need for money, Captain, believe me.
I, myself, am in debt for slightly less than $40,000.
But, uh, I still would not like to make that jump.
Well, how can a guy like you be in debt for $40,000?
I ask myself that from time to time.
All I can tell you is that...
...life... is clear for me up there alone.
In the sky I found, even in my enemies, courage, honour and chivalry.
On the ground...
Is it secured?
Huh?
- Is it secured?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- I'm gonna put the switch in back here, now.
- Yeah.
Are you sure?
- Sure about what?
- About... hey! Goddamn it!
You stupid moron! This is already a fire hazard just sitting here!
Go get me an end wrench.
Never mind. I'll get it myself.
Madden got height on you that day.
They were up in back of you with the sun behind them. How come?
Hmm. You're quite correct.
Yes, I was heading back home.
Cold and, I'm afraid, careless.
You know, I flew much better missions than this one.
Nobody knows about them, but I did.
This one only took eight minutes.
Someone down on the ground told me that once.
I was surprised.
You see...
Nothing in my life has ever been the same since.
And eight minutes, it seemed too little, like a cheat.
The five of them came at us out of the sun.
And on the first pass, Madden shot down my escort plane, which left it four to one against me.
At first, I wanted to run, but...
...they had the angles on me, so I closed with them.
And that they did not expect.
You know...
I could see how young they were.
So frightened. And they already knew my plane.
- Who was Lola?
- My first wife.
You know, I've had three.
She left me soon after the war.
They all left me, but Lola is the only one that I still seek out in crowds.
- Where was I?
- They recognized your plane.
And they forgot everything.
You know, they made such final mistakes.
And I kept on firing until they were down.
The last to go was McKinnon. And he flamed.
You know, I don't blame him for jumping.
I would have done the same thing.
But I didn't actually see him go, because Madden was on me.
- Did you know it was Madden?
- I think so, yes.
I wanted it to be, I know that.
Madden, they said, was a wonder, and I was Ernst Kessler.
But not against children.
No, that proves nothing.
You see...
I keep track of talent.
Madden tried going under you at first, didn't he?
Yes.
Were you surprised?
I thought I was done, but I manoeuvred free.
But before I could breathe, he was on me again, and I said,
"My God, is he better than I am?
"Is there someone who can beat me in the sky?
Were you scared?
No. Everything was in order.
The world made total sense.
We battled.
No lasting advantage.
He was brighter. I was smarter.
He was faster, and I was quicker.
Until...
...he hesitated coming out of a turn.
His guns had jammed.
You know, I could see him.
Pounding on the guns, trying to make them regain function.
And I thought, "Run, Madden".
"Try for the clouds."
But he didn't.
He came straight for me instead.
And I thought, "You are very stupid, but you are very brave".
"So someone else will have to kill you."
Was that when you saluted?
Yes.
And then what did you do?
Wept.
Now, when you pull the smoke pot, keep it going for a full 10 seconds and then set the plane on fire.
Only, make sure the plane's really on fire before you get out.
Now, then you'll jump, and the camera ship will follow you all the way down, right. OK.
But don't open your parachute too soon otherwise you'll spoil the whole effect.
And I don't want to do this shot again. Right? Okay. Let's go.
I suppose you could not pull your chute at all, that way he'd be sure to get the right effect!
Let's go!
Get me some scissors to get this boot off.
Guess who's still alive? Me!
That's the one! We got it.
We got it. Oops.
Here we go. Steady. Steady. Here we go. You wanted to be a movie star.
Who, me? Boy, do I look forward to this a lot.
We got it.
Hold it.
Who's that? Is that Newt?
Hey, hey, hey, Newt! What you doin' in California, Newt?
I'm working, as the regional head of the CAA now.
Western sent me Axel's pilot application.
I'm down here to check a few things out.
Make a few comments about his character.
I've a stupendous character.
The world agrees on that!
Good. Good.
There any... bad habits I should know about?
- Drinking, for example?
- Oh.
- This is no problem here.
- No!
I guess if... if western's dumb enough to want you, they won't be in business long enough for you to do them any harm.
Did you know Kessler's in town?
- Huh?
- Kessler is in town.
They're filming the Madden dogfight
- for some movie.
- I know. Right. I read about that in the papers.
- The... next week or...
- No, no. It's... it's tomorrow.
Well, I guess I got it wrong.
Hey.
- You gonna come and have a drink with us?
- Oh, no, thanks.
No, thanks, but I can't I gotta get up early tomorrow.
Bet you, every pilot in town is gonna try and sneak in on this one.
I don't know about you guys, but
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
- Hey, we'll see ya.
- Yeah.
- We'll see ya, Newt.
- Happy landings, Newt. Take good care.
Do you see him?
If I saw him, I'd at least grunt or something.
- Just keep a steady lookout. I don't...
- Werfel's waiting for you.
Right!
Well, what...what do you think?
- Hey, Brown!
- Yeah!
All right. We're gonna start with some independent passes over the camera ship.
He'll signal when it's enough. Then we'll cut to some head-on passes.
But keep close. Remember at all times, keep close to the camera ship. OK?
Look, I know those are uncomfortable, and I know you didn't really wear them in the war, but there are two men dead on this picture already, so you'll wear them now. Any questions?
What'd they do that for?
- Who's flying with Kessler?
- Brown.
New guy.
I'll get him when he gets down.
I don't understand. What are they doing?
They're actually fighting, for Christ's sake.
Come on, Waldo! Shake him!
Well, as long as he's up there.
He's gonna run him into the hill!
Jesus, he rammed him!
Well, get a camera on them, will you.
If those stupid bastards are gonna kill each other, I want it on film!
Where the hell are they?
There's Waldo.
Look!
One more pass and you got him!
(CHURCHGOERS SINGING)
Man of sorrows! What a name
For the Son of God, who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim
Hallelujah
What a savior
Bearing shame and scoffing rude
In my place condemned
He stood
Sealed my pardon with
His blood
Hallelujah
What a savior
Guilty, vile and helpless we
Spotless lamb of God was He
"Full atonement!" can it be?
Hallelujah
What a savior
When He comes, our glorious King
All His ransomed home to bring
Then anew His song we'll sing
Hallelujah
What a savior
Remember that we are all imperfect.
We see but in part.
We know but in part.
So let each of us study to approve ourselves to God through Jesus Christ.
As under the Redeemer's gentle reign, the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid.
That's a repossession.
Got less than 1,000 miles on the clock.
Hah!
I wouldn't shit you, kid.
Hell, you kids are just too damn smart this day and time.
- Go on. Try it on for size.
- Hey, thank you.
She's cleaner than a cat's ass.
Go on, kick her up.
How much?
She's practically brand new, boy.
$3,000 and some change.
Well, I'm just looking, you know.
No, I don't know.
I mean, I don't know if you're man enough to take on a car like this.
Are you?
I don't know.
I have a wooden leg.
You're kiddin'?
You wouldn't kid about a thing like that, would ya?
I'm not kidding.
You're serious?
You never can tell.
Hey, come back here with my car, you hippy son of a bitch.
Come back. What are you doin' stealin' my car?
Come back here you...
PREACHER: A true Christian, like his divine master, is of a meek and forgiving temper.
He owes no man anything but to love one another.
And he overcomes evil with good.
Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth, peace and goodwill towards men.
ALL: Amen.
Hey, uh...
Whoo-hoo!
Asshole.
(PANTING) Oh.
I thought you were the heat.
Do I look like heat?
You look like one crazy son of a bitch for a preacher,
I'll tell ya that.
Who's that guy back there in the wheat?
Old friend.
With friends like that, you don't need enemies.
Which way are we headed?
We?
All right, which way are you headed?
South.
South's all right with me.
You must like my drivin'.
Oh, I love it.
Ever thought of doin' it professionally?
What?
- Driving.
- Why?
You got blue eyes.
All great race champions have blue eyes. That's a fact.
And all preachers drink like fish.
That's another fact.
What's your name, boy?
Lightfoot.
You Indian?
Nope, just American.
(WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE PLAYING)
If I knew the way,
I'd go back home
But the countryside has changed so much
I 'd surely end up lost
Half-remembered names and faces so far in the past
On the other side of bridges that were burned once they were crossed
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When there's no one left to listen
To a story without meaning
That nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When there's no one left to listen
To a story without meaning
That nobody wants to hear
It's cold up here.
How's your arm?
Feels like lead.
Give me your belt, will ya?
Your belt, c'mon!
Oh, my God!
You ain't no country preacher, preacher.
I can tell ya that. Who are ya?
Where are the license plates for that thing?
Don't have any. I bagged it short of about five minutes before I ran into you.
Almost ran into you.
You like to spend money, boy?
Yeah, when I can get it.
Do you care how you get it?
No.
If it doesn't cost me too much.
Howdy. How's business?
Business? In this business, you're always one step away from bankruptcy.
Funny money, credit, speculation.
That ain't it.
Somewhere in this country's a little ol' lady with $79.25.
The five cents is a Buffalo Nickel.
That ain't it.
She ever cashes in her investment, whole thing'll collapse.
General Motors, the Pentagon, the two-party system and the whole shebang.
Arnold, what is he saying to you?
That's it.
We're all running downhill.
Gotta keep running faster all the time or we'll all fall down.
Arnold, what was he saying to you?
Arnold?
What did he say to you?
Did he insult you?
Excuse me,
I don't wish to be forward, but we'd like to exchange cars with you.
So the faster you get out, the better it'll be for your ass.
- Arnold... (SCREAMS) Oh!
- Come on, out.
Arnold! Oh...
I thought we were only gonna get the plates? (LAUGHS)
Well, we didn't have a screwdriver.
Hey, look at this, man.
Look, they got a whole department store back here.
- Yeah.
- Hey, I like that.
Those clothes and your mouth, you could be a big man.
Yeah, busy night.
LIGHTFOOT:
I never paid for it in my life.
Sometimes you have to pay for pleasure.
(LAUGHS) Not me. I'll never pay for it, I can tell you that.
Well, this is where I get out.
You sure don't know a good thing when you see it, do you?
Hey, why don't you take this watch, huh?
I want you to have it.
I don't want your watch, man.
I want your friendship.
God damn it,
I like you, that's all.
I thought we were gettin' to be friends.
We're good together.
Kid, you're ten years too late.
You sure are one lost dude, aren't you?
- Thanks again.
- Yeah.
Shit.
You're as young as you feel.
Hello.
(LAUGHING) Hey, we gotta stop meetin' like this.
People are going to talk.
Very funny.
No, with a preacher man, especially.
Where there's smoke, there's fire, you know?
Yeah.
MAN: (IN CAR)
How y'all doin', baby?
Quick, get in! Quick!
Hey, what is this?
Why walk when you can ride?
You son of a bitch. Stop this car.
Let me outta here right now...
Hey, what's the matter?
Don't you like my face?
You're the best-looking face I've seen all day. I can tell you that.
And just where the hell do you think you're taking me?
Anywhere you say, sweetness.
I'm hungry.
Chili, right?
Um... (CHUCKLES)
I didn't get your name.
Oh, I didn't give it to ya.
My name is Lightfoot.
- Lightfoot?
- That's right.
That's a dumb name. I mean, what kind of a person would name a kid that?
- You know?
- What's your name?
Melody.
Melody?
(LAUGHS) That's not a dumb name?
Hey, maybe we had the same father.
Brought back some extra goodies.
Are you outta your mind?
This is Gloria and Melody.
- BOTH: Pleased to meet you.
- Melody, Gloria.
Go right in, ladies.
You're full of all kinds of surprises, aren't you?
Gloria has a great ass, doesn't she?
(LAUGHS) It's the best
I've ever seen, really.
Wouldn't you say that, Melody?
Listen, I just got out of a bed to come here, you know.
And I don't intend to jump right back into one here.
Oh, I forgot to tell ya.
Gloria is yours.
Take it easy, Gloria.
You're killin' me.
GLORIA: Where did you get all those scars from?
PREACHER: Marines, Korea.
GLORIA: Oh, yeah?
I heard about that war.
(GRUNTS) Ooh!
Mmm...
What are you doin'?
Getting dressed.
Why?
So you can take me home.
What for?
You can stay here tonight.
No, no, I have to get home before it's light out.
Look, if you think I'm leavin' here at 3:30 in the morning to take you wherever the hell home is, you're crazy.
Oh, you'd better take me or I'll walk out of here stark-naked and scream "Rape."
Sure you will.
That would be stupid.
GLORIA: Rape!
Rape!
- Do you think we should stay here?
- Why not?
Get your clothes on.
Here's some money.
You can take a cab.
Sweets to the sweets!
How did you do?
Red-haired women are bad luck.
You sure that's their car?
That's their hearse.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sweetness.
- Okay, what'll it be this morning?
- I'm gonna have you.
And four scrambled eggs, very loose.
Bacon, toast, coffee.
And American fries.
You got American fries?
- Yes.
- American fries?
Right.
Just coffee, black. Thanks.
Okay. Thank you.
(EXCLAIMS) God, it's poetry!
Good jaw.
I love 'em like that.
Nice and tight. Jesus!
How you feelin' today, preacher?
The clock uncoils the working day, and he wakes up feeling his youth has gone away.
Now what the hell is that?
A prayer?
A poem.
- A poem? (LAUGHS)
- Poetry.
Ah.
You stick with me, kid.
You can live forever.
Sir.
You big son of a bitch!
You must've been into something very big, preacher. Very big.
I can't see.
Damn, they're goin' fast.
I can't see 'em.
I don't know how the hell
I could've missed 'em so many times.
Shoot.
I think you got...
No, you didn't either.
Hang on!
He went over the...
What do we do now, Red?
Geronimo!
Now, in a case like this, you can't take your hands off the wheel even for a second, see.
Get your hands on the wheel.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
(GRUNTS) Shit!
What do we do now, Red?
Shut up, Goody.
Goddamn ding-ding.
Ah.
Yeah, transmission's finished.
Seals are all gone.
Cadillac's my car anyway.
- Where are we now?
- (SIGHS)
Hells Canyon.
Snake River.
Mostly huntin' camps and sheep camps.
Up here, people's business is nobody's but their own.
Hells Canyon delivery boat's gonna come by pretty soon. The Idaho Dream.
Should take us right up the river.
Better off gettin' as far away from me as you can, boy.
In for a penny, in for a pound.
Lonely country, kid.
You got any people?
(LAUGHS) I don't even know anymore. That's weird.
Last time I saw any of them I was just a kid.
I was a little too much for them to handle, you know.
(CHUCKLES) So, they sent me away to one of these boarding schools.
And on the train I met this woman.
Oh, man!
So, the next thing I know, we're getting off the train together in New Orleans, right.
Two weeks later,
I wake up in some fleabag hotel.
(LAUGHING) Oh, God!
But we had ourselves a good time.
So, after her, things looked good.
I kept movin'.
Now, you can't stop?
Here she is.
Idaho Dream.
Oh, did you see that?
Oh, a steelhead, man.
Beautiful.
- Ah... Did you see that?
- Where?
Yeah.
Well, my good friend, we're broke.
Do you have any suggestions?
If I knew what you know,
I'd never be broke.
Well, what do you think I know that you would like to know?
All right.
Well, for one thing,
I'd like to know if there's a good way of beating a bank.
(SCOFFS) Banks! What the hell do you know about banks?
What the hell do you know about banks?
What's so funny?
- You.
- Me? (LAUGHS)
That's right.
Hey, a man can do whatever he sets his mind to.
Now, me,
I wanna walk in and buy a white Cadillac convertible.
Actually walk in and buy it, cash.
You might set your mind to gettin' us a lift.
- Hey!
- This walkin' is tough on my bad leg.
This is the best time. Most state troopers are having coffee now.
LIGHTFOOT: Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey!
That sure isn't any white Cadillac.
Beggars can't be choosy.
You simple-minded son of a bitch.
Get in the back seat.
Get in the back seat.
There's a raccoon in here.
Hell with the raccoon.
Get in the back seat.
Boy, what's the matter with you? I ain't got all day to wait on you. Come on.
(JABBERING) I've been...
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.
I've been drivin' all over this country, man.
This guy another friend of yours?
Slightly advanced, isn't he?
PREACHER: Hey!
- (DRIVER LAUGHING)
- Hey, what's wrong with this wreck?
We're gettin' gassed back here.
This guy's a basket case.
He's got the exhaust pipe in here.
He's not your run-of-the-mill basket case, is he?
This guy is definitely out to lunch.
What the hell's the matter with you, boy?
Hey, you're good, man.
Very good.
Glass head, like all these nuts.
I don't know what the hell we're gonna do with all these rabbits.
Let 'em out.
I saw that.
That was very good.
Where are we headed, man?
I'm ready.
I don't know. Sometimes when there's nothin' to do, it's best just to keep movin'.
You smell somethin' up here?
No.
Smell that?
I don't smell anything.
It smells like shit.
Ah...
- Raccoon shit.
- Raccoon shit.
Hang your hand out the window and let the rain get at it.
- Would you like a little on your...
- No, get outta here!
Just remember not to pick your teeth.
(LAUGHING) Oh, God.
Now, in these small-town banks, they leave the telephone off the hook in the vault at night so the local operator can listen in.
People walk into these banks today with paper sacks, fill 'em full of money and they walk out.
You see that all the time.
Anybody can do it.
Bullshit.
Now, the newest bank vaults have walls of reinforced concrete five feet thick, backed by six inches of steel.
The vault door is stainless steel-faced.
It's an inch and a half of cast steel, another 12 inches of burn-resisting steel, and another inch and a half of open-hearthed steel.
Come here.
A vault door has 20 bolts, each an inch in diameter.
Eight on each side, eight on the other, two top and two bottom.
This holds the door into a 16-inch steel jamb set in 18 inches of concrete which is crosshatched by steel bars running both vertical and horizontal.
Now, this door is precision-made so you can't pour nitro in between the seam of the door and the vault.
Yeah.
(SIGHS) If that isn't enough, there's microphones, electric eyes, pressure-sensitive mats, vibration detectors, tear gas, and even thermostats that detect the slightest rise in temperature.
You still interested in banks, kid?
- I knew you weren't a preacher. (LAUGHS)
- Shit.
Preaching isn't so bad.
You get used to it.
Uh, you are what you do, so to speak.
At times I even forgot about the money.
What money?
Montana Armored.
Montana Armored?
How did you get into the vault?
(EXHALES) 20 mm cannon with armor-piercing shells.
Wasn't too hard.
Hey, that was on the news.
That was a big deal.
What did they call that guy?
The Thunderbolt.
That's you.
(LAUGHS) You're the Thunderbolt.
Mmm-hmm, parson's luck.
Oh, no!
Watch out for the dog shit.
Thunderbolt!
Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. That sounds like something, doesn't it?
You're forgetting I'm a hell of a lot older than you are kid.
Hey, there are plenty of guys twice my age who don't know their ass from a hole in the ground.
I won't fault you there.
In for a penny, in for a pound.
So, who are these guys that are following us?
Oh...
The big dude's a war hero.
His name's Red Leary.
Saved my life once in Korea.
He was sent to prison in Illinois later on for stabbing a woman.
There he met an old-time bank robber, named Billy Lamb.
Lamb taught him how to break safes.
Lamb was a real genius for organization.
Thanks.
When they got out,
Lamb introduced him to Dunlop,
Dunlop's an electronics expert or was.
That's the guy you took care of in the field.
- Wanna brew?
- Definitely.
The little Orphan Annie-eyed character's Eddie Goody.
He's a driver.
He's harmless when he's alone.
So, what happened to the money?
Hey, I don't care anything about the money, you know that.
We're friends, right?
I like you as a friend.
Yeah.
Oh, we hid it in a one-room schoolhouse in Warsaw, Montana.
A place Lamb went to when he was a kid.
Hid it in the wall right behind the blackboard.
Half a million dollars-worth.
It's still there.
Schoolhouse?
Right behind the blackboard.
Why?
Well, it was always Lamb's practice to control the money till the final split.
We kept in contact with each other through personals in the newspaper.
Then Lamb had a heart attack and died.
Guess he was just too old for it.
Leary got suspicious but I wasn't about to tell him where the hell the money was, because I knew he'd go straight to it, heat or no heat.
Well, then the police released a thing in the press saying that the money had been found.
Bullshit.
Leary went off his ass.
He got careless but he couldn't lead them to the money
'cause he didn't know where the hell it was.
Finally, they arrested and convicted him on another bank robbery that took place several years before.
And when he got out he convinced the others I'd set him up.
I decided best that I should drop out for a while.
That church was a pretty far-out idea.
Hmm.
About as far out as possible,
I thought.
Fuck!
Are you sure this is the spot?
Yeah.
What?
I didn't hear what you said.
I said, yeah, this is it.
Well, what happened to it?
I don't know. Progress.
Have a nice day, boy.
Here, for you.
That's the last of our money.
It's good.
Real good.
Fantastic pistachio.
What do we do now?
Drop your cocks and reach for your socks.
Don't look at me.
I didn't say a word.
- Red?
- Start the car.
Freeze, you son of a bitch.
The first one of you moves I shoot.
All right, kill the engine.
Hand me the keys and don't turn around.
Now, both of you get out of Pistachio's side.
No ideas, you'll both be dead before you hit the ground.
Move it.
Turn around.
The guy's in the car.
That's it, smartass.
Red. Goody.
How's Dunlop?
That's for us to know and you to find out.
Shut up, Goody.
Well, what do you want, Red?
What do I want?
You got balls.
I'll say that for you, Johnny.
I want your ass, that's what
I want, my friend.
Hey, flattery's not gonna get you guys anywhere.
Who's the comedian?
Name's Lightfoot.
Does he know everything?
- No.
- Yeah.
Lightfoot, huh?
Yeah.
It's a good thing
I didn't hit him in the face.
He'd be dead now.
You always had a high opinion of yourself, Red.
What have you been preaching lately, Johnny?
Survival.
- Are you ready?
- I've been counting the days.
That's for the kid.
Now, do you wanna talk or you wanna play games?
What do you want me to do, Red?
Shut your face.
I can't breathe! I got asthma.
What do you want me to do now, Red?
Kill the son of a bitch.
Here?
Yes.
Now?
Now!
Don't ever point a gun at me.
Understand?
Not even a twig.
You got it.
You come from the hitters, don't you?
What are you waiting for?
Why don't you kill me?
I would've killed you.
That doesn't make up for a difference in two years.
I'm gonna kill you anyway.
The money was here, in the schoolhouse.
What's this garbage talking about?
The money was never recovered.
The TV, and the radio, the papers, everybody was lying.
They were working with the police.
When Lamb died I...
I never came back here.
The money's still here.
It's safe.
Here?
Yeah. Lamb went to school here in Warsaw, a little one-room schoolhouse.
We put the money in the wall, behind the blackboard.
Where's this one-room schoolhouse?
Gone.
Gone? Gone where?
I wish I knew.
Used to be right where the new schoolhouse is now.
You expect me to believe all this crap?
It's the sad-ass truth, Red.
Why do you think I'd come to a dumb town like this?
RED:
How the hell do I know?
You're queer for dumb towns.
Half a million dollars just don't disappear like that.
They should've found something when they tore the place down.
I wish I had the answer for you.
The sad part is that we got away with it.
It's a sin, that's what it is.
Christ, it's a sin.
Oh.
Boy, I feel old.
What are we gonna do now, Red?
Shut up, Goody.
I got hay fever too.
Why not do it again?
What's he mouthing off about now?
Montana Armored. We hit the same place, the same way.
- Montana Armored?
- Yeah?
What?
Hey, they'd never expect it.
Not something that big.
It's never been done before, has it?
Oh, that'd really be something, wouldn't it?
Yeah, it sure would.
Hey, I think that's a great idea.
Let's not get queer about a crackpot idea.
What the hell does the kid know, anyway?
Besides the Lamb is dead and he wrecked Dunlop.
You don't need the Lamb anymore.
We do it exactly the same way.
You already did it once.
You might have something there.
The blind leading the blind. He's a kid. He eats pistachio ice cream.
Jesus, you can lead a mule to water, but you can't make him drink it.
That's a horse, not a mule.
It's a horse.
I agree.
- Agree with what?
- With him.
Good grief.
Even if I did agree, which I don't, what would we use as a stake to operate with?
Well, we could all get jobs for a while.
Goody, you're better at asking questions than you are at answering them.
And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid.
What's that?
A poem?
No, it's a prayer.
200. Just 200 for the pot.
Better than letting that piece of junk run out on the highway.
We got Goody's car still.
The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.
Where the hell do you pick up these pearls of wisdom?
Books.
You mean you can actually read?
I read you loud and clear.
You better believe it.
All right, that's enough.
We got to keep it together now.
If you guys can't manage that, then I walk.
I'd like to hit him again just for the hell of it.
THUNDERBOLT: Well, there it is.
LIGHTFOOT: That's it?
Sure doesn't look like much, does it?
Doesn't look like much?
You dopey son of a bitch.
Goody, help me out...
Simple-minded son of a bitch.
What did you get in my way for?
Love this guy.
LIGHTFOOT: We're gonna be great friends, Red.
You forgot to give me your Social Security number.
What?
I said that you forgot to give me your Social Security number.
I've forgotten it.
Forgotten it? (LAUGHS)
Come on, nobody ever forgets their number. Where you been working?
Uh, listen, I'm gonna need it for these.
So, if you can bring it to me tomorrow I'd appreciate it.
Thanks. Hey.
Do you live near?
Man, I'm going crazy.
That drives me wild.
She just does something to me.
GOODY:
Why did you leave like that?
I couldn't wear that stuff. Too humiliating. And you look ridiculous.
What's this?
That's my route.
Just follow the streets and it takes you right back to the garage.
If you don't mind my saying,
I think you should get a job.
- Nobody asked you.
- All right, all right.
Read me the first street.
Left on 12th Avenue South to 9th Street, right on North 3rd to the viaduct...
One at a time!
Left on 12th Avenue South.
FOREMAN: You boys are being paid by the hour!
Whoo!
We haven't got all day on this mother. Got to move it.
Baby, baby
Baby, down baby
Baby, baby
There's a kid now.
Pull over.
It's my truck.
I know what to do.
You're on the wrong street.
What?
I said you're on the wrong street.
- What's he talking about?
- By me.
You're too early.
You're supposed to go down the next street first, and then come up this street.
Well, listen.
While we're here, can I sell you anything?
No, I'm waiting for Judy Ann.
They have a better flavor of pistachio.
Look, kid, go fuck a duck.
Here comes, uh,
Lightfoot.
He's late, as usual.
Hey, the woman came to the window again today.
Stark-naked this time.
Stark-naked?
No kidding?
What did she do?
Just stood there and stared at me.
How close was you?
As close as I am to you right now.
Did you see everything?
What do you mean, everything?
You know what I mean, everything.
Clear as day.
What did you do about it, big mouth?
I'll kill you for that!
Sit down, Red. Sit down!
RED: Young kids, they don't believe in anything anymore.
You'll get yours when this is over.
One way or another.
You can believe in that.
SPEAKER: All maintenance personnel off the floor.
Bringing in the guard dogs now.
To hell with them damn dogs.
They treat them better than they treat us.
Every night, they rush us out of here like animals.
Let's not argue now, Sam.
Those dogs ate up a man here once.
- Ate him?
- Yeah.
Wrong man came on duty, dogs ate him up.
They'll go through a plate-glass window to get at you.
Now, a man just don't fool around with those kind of animals.
Hey, man. Play it cool.
What did you think about that shot?
You know, the double rail.
Three-ball in the corner pocket?
Pretty honky I'll tell you.
I thought it was a pretty good shot.
There wasn't anything wrong with it.
Wasn't the best shot, but it's all right.
- Who's that guy?
- Oh, he's a new guy.
He won't even come outside anymore.
Matter of fact, when he gets to work, he keeps that door locked tight.
Why's that?
Well, one time we got him out here on the sidewalk, you know.
And I kind of got up close to him and unzipped my pants and took out my pecker.
And I put that dude right in his hand.
He turned white. He didn't know whether to hold it or drop it or run off down the street with it.
It was the funniest thing
I ever saw in my life.
We just all rolled up out of here on the sidewalk splitting our guts.
It was really funny.
Hey, Mario.
Hey, boss, it's raining.
Work between the drops.
Hey, Mario, what do we do about the rain?
Take your lunch hour now.
Lunch?
It's 9:00 in the morning.
Shit! Son of a bitch.
My own brother-in-law.
Got every skirt in the neighborhood chasing after him.
You'd think he'd share one with me just once.
Just once, it never happened.
Stick out your tongue.
I'll teach you how to lick your eyebrows.
You'll have every woman on the block hangin' off your ass.
- (LAUGHS)
- Hey, can I borrow the truck?
- What for?
- Doctor.
You got a dose?
Full disaster, man.
Yeah, go ahead. We're on our lunch hour. What the hell.
Just don't wrap it up.
It's my ass if you do.
Hey, don't worry.
I'll be back in an hour.
- I'm just gonna go upstairs and clean up.
- All right.
Hey, where'd you get those pants?
You freak!
I love you! Come back!
Where'd you get the dents?
Progress.
Hey, Leary, I had a dream about you last night.
What about?
I dreamt you said hello to me.
Now, don't you go getting smart again with me, Lightfoot.
I'll break both your arms.
Oh, well, I'll keep that in mind.
You just remember what I said. John and me go back a long way together.
Before Korea even.
But you don't mean nothing to me, you understand? Nothing!
What'd you try and kill him for then?
Because we were friends.
Thank you.
You boys are new around here.
Aren't you?
LIGHTFOOT: Yeah.
MAN: Here's your receipt.
LIGHTFOOT: Oh, thanks.
You're gonna need some help with that box?
Ah, no thanks. We can manage by ourselves. Thank you.
Okay. Suit yourself.
Relax. Relax.
One tank to a pop. Johnny got four of them in Korea.
They gave him a Silver Star.
He was a hero.
Hero?
That son of a bitch even saved my life once.
Come on.
This isn't gonna work.
I wish Dunlop was still here.
How did you take care of the alarm last time?
Dunlop monitored the frequency of the signal on the wire.
He duplicated it and then ran it back into the circuit with a spring-loaded snap switch.
The whole deal fit into two lunchboxes.
We don't have Dunlop now, do we?
Yeah, you took care of that.
Trouble with these new alarm systems, they buzz directly into the branch manager's bedroom and the telegraph office.
Now, this lulls whoever is busting into the vault into a false sense of security, because he doesn't hear an alarm go off.
Yeah, It's still a hard-wire system, runs right through the telegraph lines.
There's no antenna there,
I'm sure of that.
We just got to make sure that the alarm isn't reported.
Now, the big risk, of course being is if they've run a hard wire into someplace else, like the Sheriff's office.
How far away is that?
I clocked that on the truck doing 40 miles per hour.
Now, if the police come down on us hard, say, at an average of 80 miles an hour,
I figure we're seven minutes on the inside,
10 minutes on the outside, depending on which route they take.
However, I think to be absolutely sure that we should use five minutes as our bottom line from the time you trip the alarm inside the vault.
Unless a patrol car happens to be cruising closer.
THUNDERBOLT: All right.
Five minutes it is.
Now, Leary and I will take care of the manager's house.
It's Sunday so the bars will be closed.
The only place open will be the telegraph office.
At exactly 10:30,
Goody, you're gonna drop Lightfoot off in the alley behind the Liberty Lounge.
The window's already been fixed so you can climb right in and change your clothes.
You stay there until 11:30.
Don't fool around the bar or anything.
You stay right there until
At 11:30, you climb out of there and you get into the telegraph office.
You got to get in there before 11:35, because that's when the alarm goes off.
Now, you'll see a light light up on the console.
When that lights up, that means
Leary and I are in the vault.
And we don't care how you get inside.
Look, I don't know if I can pull this thing off.
How am I supposed to know what to do?
What's the matter?
Is the job too tough for you?
You know, you can't stop this thing once you start.
Billy the Kid.
THUNDERBOLT: All right, this isn't a game, you know.
You got to get that fat guy before he reports the alarm.
You tie him up, gag him and put him in the can.
People are used to him being in the can for long periods of time.
And you leave the place neat.
Understand? Just like you found it.
Now, at 11:36 Goody comes around back.
If you're not ready to go, he goes without you.
You get in the car and you hit the floor.
You stay there, you don't talk.
You don't make any noise.
You don't move around till Goody tells you.
At 11:39 Goody comes back to the vault.
Leary and I will be there with the money.
If we're not, you just keep right on going.
If we pull this whole thing off, we should be able to make the midnight movie at the drive-in.
Then what?
We watch the show.
Then in the morning we split the money up and go our separate ways.
Here's a watch.
You're gonna need a watch now.
Hey, Billy.
Don't forget to shave.
Tweet tweet.
...will Charlie Johnson, please, in the blue Chevy,
license plate 74.
Is he here?
Three guys in the back, "Huh?"
DON: I'm not gonna say it again, lady.
I'm warning you now.
MERV:
How do you see yourself?
DON: Nude, usually.
MERV: Tell me, if you were the producer of the show,
how would you produce Don Rickles?
DON: Trying to be pretty much what I am.
I mean doing what
I do on the stage.
There's certain words that you use, that I don't find offensive,
but you can't use it on television.
Keep quiet and nobody gets hurt.
Wake him up.
Wake him up.
Jack. Jack!
What the hell's the matter with you?
Oh, no. Not again.
You just keep quiet and nobody gets hurt. Understand?
Oh, my God! My child. Please!
She's just a baby.
Okay, but just keep it down.
I don't want my mother to hear me.
Oh, my God!
MAN:
I was just getting started.
All right! I want the combination of the outer guard doors.
Left series first.
Come on.
Uh, L-2,
R-3, R-7.
Uh, L-2, R-3,
R-5, R-7.
Again. Faster.
Uh, L-2, R-3, R-7,
JACK: L-2, R-3, R-5, R-7.
All right. One more time.
Now really fast.
JACK: L-2, R-3, R-7,
L-2, R-3, R-5.
R-7.
All right.
Now backwards. Quick.
Come on!
You're confusing me.
Say it fast or you'll never say anything again.
R... (CLEARS THROAT)
7, R-5, L-3...
NO, R-3, L-2!
Uh, R-7, L-2, R-3, R-5, R-7.
What a way to go.
It's 11:15.
You ready?
Right.
Murph, shake your ass up.
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Oh, you sexy bitch.
I'd even go out with you myself.
- (FABRIC RIPS)
- Oh! Shit!
When this is over,
I'm gonna get that kid.
You'll have to come by me first.
Hi. Come on in.
MAN: Hi.
Fill it up with high-test.
Where the hell is he, anyway?
That's five.
Goody!
Goody!
Get some more.
No, let's go. Come on.
GOODY: Hello, Red.
You did a good job.
Thanks.
Oh, here's your watch back.
Keep it.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
But after all that running around,
I gotta go so bad I can't see straight.
I got weak kidneys.
Shut your mouth or you'll drown both of us.
All right, keep quiet back there now.
WOMAN:
If you gotta go, you gotta go.
Yes, sure.
Do you think she heard that?
I can't help it.
I'm dyin' back here.
Red-haired women are bad luck.
What's wrong?
Just stay calm, Red.
So far, so good.
WOMAN: (IN MOVIE) Yeah, it's good.
Full of vitamin hay.
Try some.
MAN: (IN MOVIE) Ow!
- (SIGHS)
- What do you think?
Is that the heat?
Here.
That's seven minutes the inside.
Nice work, Goody.
Seems there was another hook-up after all.
You mean everything
I did was for nothing?
Seems that way, doesn't it?
Oh, Christ!
Come on, keep your lid on now, Louise.
Goddamn! Hello, Murph.
MAN:
Hey, what's with that light?
WOMAN:
I know they're in here.
Are you sure about this, now?
I am sure. Sure as hell I am.
All right, if they're in here, now we're gonna get 'em out.
Okay.
Son of a bitch.
Red-haired women are bad luck, man.
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
What's goin' on up there?
This is crazy.
I must be outta my mind.
I told you not to listen to that fucking kid.
Take it easy, Red.
You go fuck yourself.
Will you shut up?
Shut the hell up will you, Leary.
I'm up to here with you, with all of ya.
I'm gettin' out of this fuckin' coffin right now.
MAN: Hey! Hey!
Stay outta sight.
Go, man, go.
POLICE: (ON SPEAKERS) Your attention, please. This is the police.
Repeat. This is the police.
Everyone stay in your car.
Oh! Uh-oh!
Goody's hit.
You're gonna be dead soon anyway.
Stop the car.
Oh, Leary...
Are you outta your mind?
Stop right now or you're dead meat, and you know I mean that.
Now, give me that gun, real slow.
Now, get out this side, both of ya, and don't bother openin' your mouth.
Christ, Red, this is dumb man.
This is dumb.
On the ground, both of you.
What happened to Goody?
I threw that little sucker out.
You prick!
Say somethin' funny now, smartass.
Wow.
Hey, kid. Hey.
Are you all right, kid?
Can you hear me?
You all right, boy?
Oh, man, I'm dizzy.
I'm dizzy.
Come on, you'll be all right.
Let's go.
Let's go, boy.
What happened?
Must've got a call on the car and think it's us.
I need clothes.
We'll find Goody.
Dead man's clothes?
Come on. We haven't got time to mess around.
Hey, you got the Silver Star.
You're the real hero, not Leary.
- Where'd you get that?
- Leary, it's true isn't it?
What difference does it make?
No difference I just wanted to know, that's all.
(LAUGHS) Alarms. Alarms!
That's a real pisser!
Jesus Christ.
OFFICER: My God...
Okay, boys, this is where I turn off.
Unless you wanna see Warsaw.
Thanks a lot, man.
Impossible.
What are you seeing?
THUNDERBOLT: The one-room school house. There it is.
"Moved to this site
July 4th, 1972."
They moved it.
What'd they move it for?
Who knows?
History.
History, damn it.
Do you think?
I don't know, but it do present mind-boggling possibilities.
WOMAN: Sam, look at this old kerosene lamp.
SAM: Just a minute.
Let me get this.
Hi.
Hiya, fellas. How are ya?
It's a nice schoolhouse you have here.
Sure is.
Come on.
We gotta go, honey. Come on.
Now, we don't want any trouble, fellas.
Okay?
Have the camera if you want.
It's worth something.
You can have them both.
What do you say? Huh?
- (LAUGHS)
- I got a bit of money back here.
I can let you have, huh?
Even give you these car keys.
- SAM: Come on, hon.
- Don't shove me.
SAM: Get in the car.
Get in the car.
Hey, do you think it's still there?
I don't know.
Only one way to find out, I guess.
Why don't you watch the door?
Okey dokey.
THUNDERBOLT: Lightfoot?
Lightfoot!
You all right, boy?
Yeah.
It's nothin'. God, I must be gettin' tired or somethin'.
Lift up on it and then ease the screw out.
Turn it with your hand.
Oh! I got it.
Sorry.
My arm went numb.
Wow!
Impossible.
MAN: Good luck now.
Thanks again.
Hey, hey, hey!
Ride?
Where you headed?
See what's over the next mountain.
Why not?
I'll put on a little music.
Have a cigar.
Where the hell did these come from?
I've been saving them for a celebration.
After all, we won, didn't we?
I guess we did, for the time being.
No, we made it.
We made it.
Not bad.
You know...
You know somethin'?
I don't think of us as criminals, you know?
I feel we accomplished something. A good job.
I feel proud of myself, man.
I feel like a hero.
Are you all right, kid?
You don't look too well.
I believe you're right.
Lightfoot!
You all right, kid?
What's...
(WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE PLAYING)
If I knew the way,
I'd go back home
But the countryside has changed so much
I 'd surely end up lost
I 'd surely end up lost
Half-remembered names and faces so far in the past
On the other side of bridges that were burned once they were crossed
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When there's no one left to listen
To a story without meaning
That nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When he knows there's something missing
Tell me where
Where do I go from here
Where do I go from here
To get back home
Where my childhood dreams and wishes
Still outnumber my regrets
And get back to a place where I can figure on the odds
Have a fighting chance to lose the blues
And win my share of bets
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When there's no one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody wants to hear
Tell me where, where does a fool go
When he knows there's something missing
Tell me where
Where do I go from here
Oh, tell me where, where does a fool go
When there's no one left to listen
To a story without meaning that nobody...

Hey, anybody in?
Quiet!
Come here!
I beg your pardon!
Which way to Lubicz and Wodokty?
Turn right by the cross for Lubicz, straight ahead for Wodokty.
Thanks!
You go on to Lubicz!
Good bye!
Hey, where's your mistress?
Here I am.
I'm Andrzej Kmicic.
The wind blew me here straight from camp to pay my respects.
A lucky wind, I hope.
You knew of Grandpapa's death?
I've already mourned my benefactor.
He's bequeathed
Lubicz and you to me.
Don't avert your face,
I can't see my legacy.
Oh, what a lovely one!
A hundred masses for my benefactor's soul?
When shall we be wed?
Stay, it's too early,
I'm not yet yours.
But you will be, or I'll burn down this house!
You're mine by the will of the dead and your heart.
I don't know yet about my heart
If you won't be mine
I'll stab myself!
You say that in jest, sir!
Come, my aunt will have supper sewed.
Whose aunt?
Mine.
Then she's my aunt too!
Kulwiecéwna.
I'd have come earlier, but war is a matchmaker only with death.
You weren't in a hurry.
The ensigns were already back.
I stayed to stalk the foe.
I harassed them so much, there's a price on my head.
This goose is delicious.
In the name of the
Father and of the Son...
The enemy's locked himself in the cities, the winter's so severe.
My men are worn out, like brooms from constant sweeping, so the Hetman assigned us to winter quarters.
I've sent my officers to Lubicz.
They'll come here tomorrow, to pay their respects to you.
Drink some wine, sir, please.
I'd drink poison if it was from your hands.
Your health!
The more I look at you, the more I want to marry.
When shall we be wed?
It's untimely to speak of it while in mourning.
Then I'll wither before the time is up.
Deuce take it!
Grandpapa always said you were a hothead.
You must get accustomed to it.
And you must change your habits, it cannot be like this!
Oh, so you're going to lead me by the nose.
You don't look like a man who is easily led.
They broke a lot of rods in the monastery teaching me wise maxims.
Which one do you remember best?
When in love, fall at her feet.
Let me go or I'll be angry and call my aunt.
A regiment of aunts can't stop me when I'm eager.
Traitor! Judas!
I'm not, because my kiss is sincere.
Shall I convince you?
Don't you dare!
Where I'm from they say: ask, and if it is not given, take it!
I must leave now.
It's late.
You've a long way to
Lubicz, and wolves aplenty.
I'll come with my companions on a visit tomorrow.
Goodnight...
Oh, auntie!
Here's health to my lady!
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!
Well, what is she like?
Very pretty?
Damn it! There's no other like her!
You're lucky to have someone to snuggle up to.
When's the wedding?
When the mourning's over.
Damn the mourning!
Children aren't born black but...
...white!
Here's to grandpapa Billewicz, who left you Lubicz!
Stupid! Drinking the health of the dead?
We'll sleep on straw, only don't turn us out!
Stop it.
Whatever is mine, is yours!
He won't abandon us!
Drink up!
He slashed at me like this, and I like this!
One, two, three!
You can't match Kmicic anyway!
Nobody can!
Slice them off!
No one can match him! Just try!
You can't beat me at shooting!
One ducat a shot!
Two! Between the horns!
Three! Five! Pistols!
Loaded?
Straight into the skull!
Between the horns!
He missed!
Eight in the middle! Bravo!
Fight! Die! Slay!
Wenches! Wenches!
This mustn't go any further, my reputation is at stake.
I already told girls and households not tell anybody.
Do you love me?
Like my own soul.
Colonel, sir! Stop!
He's one of my soldiers, something has happened.
What is it, Soroka?
The town is on fire, they're fighting.
Holy mother!
Don't worry.
Who's fighting?
Villagers didn't want to give fodder.
Soldiers took it.
They began firing.
Making a terrible row, bells are tolling.
We must go to their aid!
Burn the town! To arms!
Silence!
A horse!
I don't need you!
I don't want a shambles!
Back to Lubicz and wait for me.
But... Sir...
Not a word.
Farewell! Regards.
We can't have our sleigh ride.
Don't worry.
Let's drink some booze, it's cold!
They're from Lubicz.
Yes, Kmicic's companions.
Let's have another.
It smells of mead.
We don't want booze, give us mead!
There are wenches sitting by the fire.
What are you doing, damsels?
Warming our feet.
Warming their feet!!
I know a better way of warming feet.
Dance and the cold will go away!
We don't need violins,
I'll play on my battle hammer.
Go away!
Perhaps you'd dance with me?
Who are you?
Are you looking for trouble?
No use talking, away with you!
Get out!
I am my own master when I'm sitting over a pitch of mead.
I don't care for gold
I will gladly drink instead.
I was worried.
My sweet maid!
I was afraid there might be a battle.
A few villagers silenced by soldiers, that's all.
What do you mean "silenced"?
One sword stroke on the head is enough.
But that's murder!
The burghers sent for help.
A few lads and officers came.
I chased them off... and drove the officers naked in the snow.
Shame on you!
Are you sincere or just pretending?
You'll be brought to trial.
Don't you worry about that.
Everybody is his own master in this country.
If he has a sword and a few men.
Who am I to fear?
I won't marry a man with blood and tears on his conscience.
Don't drive me mad!
What do you want from me?
Just be decent.
Be well.
Farewell.
For God's sake!
Do you want me to drop dead from my horse?
Don't cry!
For God's sake, don't cry, my dearest!
I'll send them away,
I'll make up for everything.
I'll lead a different life.
I'll change.
Anybody in there?
Have they drunk themselves silly?
Rekué, it's me.
Bring me a priest.
Who slaughtered you?
Who did it?
The Butryms.
Come here!
Olenka, wake up!
Wolmontowicze is on fire!
What a disaster!
Wolmontowicze is on fire!
Can you hear me?
Oh, God!
He did it.
Holy Patriarchs,
Pray for him.
From evil death.
Save him, oh Lord.
From all evil...
Open the door!
My horse fell in the forest.
They're after me.
You burnt Wolmontowicze.
Yes, yes, I did!
The Devil coming for my soul, eh?
All right.
What's going on?
What do you want?
Kmicic has burnt Wolmontowicze.
Murdered men, women and children.
We killed his people and now we want his head!
Follow him, why do you stand here?
Isn't he here?
We found his horse.
No, the house was locked up.
Search the stables.
He's escaped to the woods!
Follow him!
Stop!
Don't hide him, miss, he's accursed.
I curse him just as you do.
Amen.
Come out, sir!
Take a horse and go!
You've blood on your hands like Cain.
Go and stay away forever!
One seldom meets such worthy people as you.
I couldn't feel better in the Prince's castle.
We thank you, sir, that you decided to stay here.
Though you'd have had the best care at the Hetman's court.
I'm all right now, my arm is fit to wield the sword.
Colonel, sir,
Kmicic has abducted the young lady.
I wonder he dared to come here.
Must be very sure of himself.
After me!
Hide behind the carriages!
To the house!
Break down the door with axes.
Stop! Stop it, hell! We'll talk.
Who's that?
Andrzej Kmicic. Who is there?
Colonel Wolodyjowski.
No time for greetings.
You ruffian, you must account for the innocent blood you've shed and this abduction.
You wouldn't call me a ruffian at an open door.
Then open it.
Listen carefully.
I have a keg of powder here.
Leave me alone or I'll blow up the house and everybody in it.
He's mad and ready to do it.
Come out and fight with me.
If you win, you'll go free.
A nobleman's word?
No! Don't do it!
Silence, damn it!
If I don't, he'll blow us all up.
Well, do the poor gentry agree?
They'll swear by their swords if you like.
Let them swear.
Assemble here, gentlemen.
All those present are my witnesses that I've challenged Mr Kmicic to a duel, and I've promised he'll go free if he wins, without any hindrance on your part.
Swear it!
I swear to God Almighty and on the Holy Cross. Amen.
Come out!
I trust your word.
Which one is Mr Wolodyjowski?
I am.
Well, you're not a giant.
Where do we fight?
Here.
All right.
I feel sorry for you,
I've heard you're a great soldier.
So I say for the last time: leave me alone.
Come on!
You asked for it.
Shall we wait until the rain stops?
It's all the same to me.
It's unpleasant to die in such heavy rain.
A Colonel will be buried, so the sky weeps.
Come on, sir!
You use your sword like a flail.
Pick it up!
Finish it, spare the shame.
He's alive, he didn't fall on his back.
Go away!
Now he's mine, not yours.
No butchering. We're knights.
One doesn't finish off a wounded man.
Dress his wound.
Young lady, you're free.
I'm Colonel Wolodyjowski.
Is he dead?
Do not fear, young lady.
Kmicic is unconscious.
Without boasting, I'm the one who did it.
By God, answer me, is he dead?
Kmicic?
Just wounded.
Thank you sir.
I've come to ask if you bear me a grudge.
Thank you for coming, sir.
I bear no grudge,
I was defeated by a fine man.
So you are the famous Misha': Wolodyjowski?
Strictly speaking, I'm Jerzy Michai, but Saint George only fought a dragon and as Saint Michael is the war lord in heaven,
I prefer to have him as my patron saint.
George is certainly no equal to Michael.
How's your health, sir?
It was a near thing.
Where did you learn to fight like that?
At war.
I'm threatened with lawsuits here.
I burnt down Wolmontowicze, that's true.
And hacked up some people.
But my companions were slaughtered too, like oxen.
And why?
Just because they wanted to dance with some damsels?
Poor souls.
As for abducting the girl, it's true she saved my life, but threw me out afterwards, so what could I do?
Well, I'll tell you, sir.
She loves you.
How do you know she loves me?
I saw her looking at you when you lay wounded.
She loves you.
If you don't understand, it's because you had your head split open.
If it was true!
I didn't say she'd marry you.
It is wartime now.
You can render great services to your country.
Win fame for courage and patch up your reputation.
Is there still time for me to do it?
I have to go to court straight from bed.
There's a remedy for that.
The Lord Hetman's writ.
You are to enlist soldiers and form a regiment.
You'll serve our country and be forgiven.
The Hetman left it to me... to give you this writ...
...or not.
What are you going to do?
And I am giving you this writ.
I'm happy to see you sir.
I'd go through
I'd go through fire for you.
Don't say that, please.
This is Andrzej Kmicic.
Why have we been called here?
We'll probably take the field.
My Lord Hetman invites you to come in, gentlemen!
My Lord Hetman invites you to come in, gentlemen!
Forgive me for keeping you waiting.
But there are so many things to do now.
I summoned you to announce unpleasant news.
Apart from the old war we have a new one.
The Swedes have broken the truce.
A beautiful country and valiant people.
But struggles between magnates, averse to the king.
What is the news from the Polish camp?
The gentry are assembling sluggishly.
Perhaps we'd better wait till King Karol Gustav arrives with the whole army.
I'd advise that if this country had a regular army.
But there's none,
I know this country well, the King is weak and lacks money.
Our forces are more than enough against their gentry.
So I may presume that this is already our land.
You may, Your Grace, you may.
What do people say?
The Colonels wonder why they were summoned without their regiments.
Are there many of the gentry?
All the important families.
Call Kmicic.
Did you come with your regiment?
As you said, sir.
Are they reliable people?
They'd go through fire and hell.
I need such men.
And men like you.
Ready for anything.
Such hard times may come that even the most loyal will waver.
May he who deserts Your Grace in the hour of danger perish.
Olenka Billewicz is here.
I sent for her, to reconcile you two.
How can I repay Your Grace for this?
How can I repay for this?
Have faith in me.
Trust me, and believe that whatever I do, is for the public good.
Don't desert me when others do.
I swear.
Swear by this crucifix that you'll not desert me till you die.
Swear by Christ's Passion.
By Christ's Passion
I swear it.
Welcome, gentlemen, brothers!
It's good that you've come.
We need great strength to save our country, and to assist me in my endeavours to do so.
I drink your health.
To the Colonels!
Suprema lex
- love of our country.
Long live the Lord Hetmam!
Defensor Patriae!
Lead us against the Swedes!
When I lay abed, close to death,
I told myself:
I won't take her by force, by sword and fire, but win her by good deeds.
I'll restore my good name at war, and be reconciled with all.
Won't you say just one kind word?
Can I believe you?
You must.
You should.
My Lord Hetman and Mr Wolodyjowski did.
Why would you alone not believe?
I've seen tears shed because of you.
Graves not yet covered by grass.
Grass will cover them.
And I'll wipe away the tears myself.
Do all that first.
Give me some hope at least.
Many among You will be surprised or even horrified by this toast.
But whoever believes and trusts me, and has the good of the country at heart, whoever is a loyal friend of the house of Radziwill, will drink it willingly and repeat after me:
Long live Carolus Gustavus,
King of Sweden!
From this day graciously reigning over us!
Vivat, vivat!
My God!
What have I done!
Your Grace, in Christ's name!
Have mercy on yourself!
Have mercy on us!
Have mercy on Poland!
Don't do it!
Don't implore him, he's a traitor!
May you die in despair!
May your lineage extinct!
May the devil take your soul, traitor!
Traitor!
Thrice traitor!
Traitor!
Traitor!
Traitor!
Kmicic, come here!
Shame on those who follow the Hetman.
Make your choice!
Jesus!
You swore by the Cross you wouldn't desert me.
I'll be damned if I keep this oath, and damned if I don't.
For Christ's sake!
Do you think that I've accepted
Karol Gustav as king forever?
That I want to unite this land with Sweden?
I want to save our country.
And all means to this end are good.
I need power.
But not out of pride.
Let he who is strong enough take it.
But if there's no such man
I'll take it.
What do you want, My Lord?
I want the crown.
Jesus and Mary!
I've surrendered this country to the Swedes to vanquish other foes with their arms.
But rocky Sweden has not enough men, not enough swords to keep the whole of Poland.
So what will they do?
Whom will they give it to?
I'll take the crown.
And when I've rebuilt this crumbling edifice, and made it more powerful,
I'll trample our foes with this foot.
So help me God and he Holy Cross.
Your Grace!
My mind can't grasp it.
My head is bursting!
What's going on there?
Perhaps help is coming?
Lift me up.
Give us back our Colonels!
It's Oskierko's infantry.
MY men!
I knew they'd claim us.
Tell them to send for your regiment!
Be quiet!
What's that?
The Scottish Regiment.
They're against us.
Our people are attacking.
Kmicic with his riders...
On whose side?
I don't know I couldn't see.
Did he throw down his mace yesterday?
I couldn't see.
To think I had this man at my mercy.
And let him live.
Wolodyjowski saved
Your Grace's life.
It was his duty.
But I'll have him shot as a rebel.
You won't do it.
I implore you, My Lord.
Spare him and the others.
Don't refuse me this favour.
And if I refuse?
Then have me shot too.
Remember who you're speaking to, wretched man!
Don't drive me to despair.
I could have listened to a supplication.
But I won't listen to threats.
Let me serve you with all my heart, not under compulsion.
Otherwise I'll go crazy.
I wrote their death sentence in my mind yesterday.
What the Hetman has written, the future Polish King can cancel.
You've got a persuasive way,
I can't refuse you anything.
Till the end of the war
I'll put them under Swedish guard.
Thank you, My Lord, my father.
Your regiment's somewhere near, isn't it?
We could try to escape.
How can we escape?
Who's that officer commanding the convoy?
Roch Kowalski,
Roch Korab Kowalski.
Tom might as well talk to his horse.
He's just as stupid.
And he's an officer?
The Prince liked him.
He breaks horseshoes in his hands.
And he'll carry out any order no matter what.
I like him very much.
I always prefer to know who I'm dealing with.
Mr Kowalski!
Come closer please.
What do you want?
Have you any liquor?
I have.
Give us some.
Why should I?
If it was forbidden, you'd have explicit orders.
But you haven't, so give me some.
You can't force me to.
No, but you're allowed to.
It's decent to help an old kinsman, who, if he'd had married your mother, would have been your father.
Fine kind of kinsman you are!
By my grandmother, she was born Kowalska.
And her crest was Korab.
By God, then you're really my kinsman!
Call me uncle.
How is your father?
By God, I've forgotten his first name!
It's Roch, too.
That's right,
Roch begat Roch.
Such is the comnandment.
Are you married?
I certainly am.
I'm Kowalski and this is my Miss.
I don't want any other.
I don't want any other.
A pity you won't have young Rochs with her.
I see you're a clever cavalier.
Well, let's drink some more.
Drain it dry.
It seems Mr Zagloba wore himself out talking to this stupid lout.
Is he his relative?
Like I'm yours.
Mister Kowalski, your uncle has arrived.
I am Kowalski and this is my Missus.
Where's my sword?
Jesus Christ!
I don't want to boast, but I did it.
I sent the most stupid officer so that they wouldn't get him over to their side, and he betrayed me.
Your Grace shouldn't have sent a Pole.
And make the Swedes think there are no
Poles at my side?
Where's Kmicic?
He went to fetch Miss Billewicz.
Set the regiments ready.
I'll lead them myself!
I have an invitation from the Prince.
I'm glad to see you in good health.
When I arrived,
I saw Olenka, but she disappeared at once.
It's no small honour for us.
But we cannot go immediately.
You cannot dawdle when the Prince waits.
So it's compulsion.
We are supposed to go to Kiejdany.
What for?
The Prince has asked us.
I told you we should flee as they won't leave us alone.
Tie us up, we won't go otherwise.
God will judge who is right, Olenka.
If I, serving the Hetman, or you calling me a traitor.
But you will go to Kiejdany.
No, we won't.
Our servants will defend us.
Here are my men coming.
You must be in the coach in a moment.
Let's go!
Where to, cavalier?
Wolodyjowski!
At your service.
The biter is bitten.
You've bad luck with me.
I stand in your way for the second time.
You were a swashbuckler then but now no honest man would duel with you.
Why is that?
Because you're a traitor.
And you've slaughtered soldiers who wanted to defend our country.
Your last hour has come.
By what right do you judge me?
Pray now, and if you have something in your defence, say it quick.
Because I doubt if this lady will intercede for you now.
I don't ask her favour.
Take him behind the barn and shoot him!
Don't let them maul me like a dog.
I'll go myself.
I'll see if he has any orders on him.
Like Roch had.
Hurry, or they'll be blood stained.
I ordered them to take him far away so the shots don't scare her.
You'll draw vengeance on our heads.
You must escape, come with us.
Right.
Oh God!
You could at least cross yourself.
None of your business, knave.
Get on with it!
You could have taken the wretch with you, to do away with him somewhere else.
How can we go, she's scarcely breathing?
It's done.
We'll put her into the coach, you must flee!
Radziwill's vengeance will spare nobody.
I've stopped the execution!
You did? Why?
Why?
Let me get my breath.
If it wasn't for that worthy man, Kmicic, we'd all be hanging now on trees in Kiejdany.
We wanted to kill our benefactor.
How can this be?
Read this and you'll have the answer.
"We, Prince Janusz Radziwill,
Great Hetman..."
And then...
I'll read it.
"On the intercession of Andrzej Kmicic"...
"we pardon Colonel Wolodyjowski and the waif with him"...
He means me.
"And the other Colonels sentenced to death for mutiny"
"and order them to be confined in the Birze prison".
"On the intercession of Andrzej Kmicic..."
If you're going to have him shot now, then, by God,
I'm parting company with you, and don't want to see you again.
What kind of desperado are you not to have shown it?
You're free, go wherever you want.
Think twice, I warn you, I'm going back to Radziwill.
Stay with us, you'll be our good companion.
The Motherland will forgive you.
No.
God will judge who best serves the Motherland!
You, by unleashing civil war, or I by serving the only man who can save this country.
To whom did you give your oath:
Radziwill, the King?
The Swedes or Poland?
You're out of your mind.
I knew I couldn't convert you.
Farewell.
Wait!
It's very important.
Tell us.
Did Radziwill promise you we'd stay alive?
Yes, you were to be kept in prison.
Then know your Radziwill, who betrays not only his country but his servitors too.
"After dismissing the convoy shoot all of these men..."
"but so that the news doesn't spread".
What's this?
The Hetman's letter to the Swedes.
I found it on Roch Kowalski.
I wish I'd perished at your hands.
Make haste, a sword hangs over our heads here.
With that man left alive, they won't murder us at once.
Hurry!
We'll be ready by the dawn.
God grant that we meet in better times.
Farewell.
Please remember a soldier who wishes you well.
Accept, sweet flower, an old man's farewell too.
Where's Kmicic?
He's back, alone.
Call him!
I came too late, they escaped.
I wanted to follow them, there's a rumour that all the Polish regiments have mutinied.
The only profit:
I've brought the girl here.
And you were saved by my letter!
Which letter, Your Grace?
The one written to me or to the Swedes?
So you know?
Yes.
Be gone.
How could you do such a thing to me?
Silent!
I won't be silent!
I was made to feel ashamed of Your Grace.
I ordered the Swedes to shoot them to spare you pain.
Look what you've done.
They're at the head of the rebellion.
Your sentiments and my weakness for you have harmed the country.
Perhaps.
But each day will be greater torture.
You're in despair because of that girl.
When will you marry her?
There'll be some fuss but next morning she'll dry her tears.
She doesn't want me,
I don't want her.
I won't beg her.
I'd like to go away, to forget.
It's up to you.
You want to leave?
Today if possible.
I'll send you to my brother,
Prince Boguslav,
I'm not strong enough to attack the rebels by myself.
Then you'll carry my letters to King Karolus himself.
Ask him to send me some cavalry and cannons.
I'll crush the rebels.
Have you an)' request?
My Grace...
Speak up, don't hesitate.
I ask Your Grace to protect her from harm here.
Be sure of that.
I'm going far away,
I don't know if I'll see you again.
I wanted to leave without a word but
I couldn't.
Let us not part in anger and rancour.
God be with you.
I have no grudge against you.
An evil spirit has come between us.
Dividing us as though by a sea.
May God guide you.
And show you the right way.
May you leave the one you've strayed to.
Don't speak of it, or we'll quarrel again.
Give me your hand.
Olenka!
Shan't we see each other anymore?
Andrzej!
Leave the traitors and all will be well.
I can't.
You better not say any more.
God, do we deserve this?
Farewell - for the last time.
Why are you crying?
Don't, or I'll go crazy!
Are you the Lord
Hetman's courtier?
My name is Kmicic and I'm not a courtier, only a Colonel.
The famous Kmicic of the last war?
I've heard a lot about you.
This is a letter from My Lord Hetman.
Sit down, cavalier,
Nothing new.
He advises me to move to Taurogi.
Which, as you see, I'm doing.
Here I'd have to declare myself with the Swedes or against them.
And it's too early for that.
The Lord Hetman is always late with his advice.
"Think of the Confederates who mutinied against me".
"They'll plunder my estates, and the beer is strong there".
"Put them to the sword when they're drunk."
Listen, Mr Kmicic.
Pretend to be the
Polish King's follower and a patriot, and murder those who won't betray the King.
Is there any sense in it?
Your Grace!
I serve the Radziwills with heart and soul.
With your fortune mine also may grow.
But I can't grasp and comprehend everything.
What do you want then?
My Lord Hetman all his deeds as being for the good of the country.
Is it only for appearances or the truth?
And if I told you it's for appearances, would you refuse to serve us?
My fortune can grow with that of the Radziwills.
You'll get somewhere.
You see if we, the Radziwills, were living in Spain,
France or even Sweden, where a son succeeds to the throne, we'd probably serve the King and Country and settle for high offices.
But in this country where the gentry elect the King?
Who can guarantee that some day they won't choose to elect a Mr Nobody from Nowhere?
This country is going to hell,
The crown go to the Lord Hetman.
And come to me after him.
More!
More!
Stop!
Saddle the horses!
They're saddled.
Strap the saddlebags!
They're strapped.
A ducat per head!
Thank you Colonel, sir!
Soroka!
You'll take two men and the packhorses.
Take the road to the woods.
Out of town at gallop!
Yes Sir!
The others load your guns.
Saddle two horses for me!
Go!
Stop!
Are you ready to die?
If you're risking your head, sir,
Why shouldn't we?
I'll reward you just as well as the Lord Hetman.
May I ask for a reward in advance?
I have a thoroughbred horse and
I don't want to wear him out.
Would you deign to use it till I return?
Then you'd better sell him to me.
I can't, it'd be like selling a friend.
He's saved me from trouble a hundred times.
And has the added virtue that he bites the enemy in battle.
Where is this wonder?
In the paddock.
A deer's legs, a wolf's step, an elk's nostrils.
And a woman's breast.
Well broken in.
When you're advancing in a row, you can drop the reins, he won't pull ahead one inch.
He keeps in line and the rider's hands are free.
At times one hand was holding a pistol while the other - a sword.
And if the line turns about?
He'll turn about too.
No horse can do that.
Please try, Your Grace.
Two men at your sides with me behind.
I'll give him to you free if he pulls ahead.
All right!
Drop the reins, Your Grace!
Take him!
What's this?
Scoundrels!
Don't you know who I am?
Don't resist or you'll get a bullet.
Traitor!
What about you?
Against whom do you raise your hand?
Easy, you'll wrench my arms!
Let him go.
Where are you taking me?
To the Confederates.
I have your letters, your villainies will be exposed.
Because I believed in the Radziwills!
What's that?
The horses are dead tired.
It won't be a plentiful place to rest in.
I have some food and vodka.
We must gather strength.
Your Grace will kindly dismount.
Why?
I'll eat and drink in the saddle.
Down on the ground, please.
And you into the ground!
Must be the devil.
I smell smoke.
Stupid!
If it was the devil, you'd smell sulphur, not smoke.
Hey!
Anyone there?
Be on your guard!
Carry the Colonel in.
Soroka...
Yes, Sir?
It was the Prince who shot at me, wasn't it?
What happened to him?
He escaped.
That's bad, that's very bad.
He killed three of our men and had the best horse.
So he won.
But we'll meet again.
Soroka!
At your service...
You up already, sir'?
You were sleeping like horses.
One could hack your heads off.
Soroka, we're going to Wolodyjowski.
They'll kill us, Colonel, sir.
I prefer that to being considered a traitor by them.
Show yourself!
What do you want?
Come here!
Don't yell from behind the bushes.
Can two of us advance?
Yes.
A miracle, sir, but I think they're our men.
Where's your second son, Mr Kiemlicz?
Not killed, I hope?
Good God!
Father!
It's Mr Kmicic!
Sweet Jesus!
It's Mr Kmicic!
Come over here!
Well, rascals, do you greet me with guns?
Such a guest!
On your knees, scoundrels!
On your knees!
Who was the first to shoot?
You shot yourself!
He's lying dog! My Lord, such a guest!
I can't believe my eyes.
Kindly come in, please.
What are you waiting for, blackheads?
Bring some mead!
How do you come to be here?
When the Butryms defeated you in Wolmontowicze, we took to the woods.
Misery and hunger.
We live on mushrooms and blueberries.
The cellar is uncovered.
Give us the key, Father.
You'll drink more than you bring!
I'll fetch it myself.
What are you doing now?
We capture horses.
From whom?
From anybody.
From Swedes too?
Surely.
And if they resist?
We thrash them.
You thrash them?
That's good.
You can take horses from the enemy.
But if you take them from your own people, then you're rogues, not nobility.
What do you do with the horses?
Father sells them.
Go cover the cellar!
Mead isn't good for a wound.
Shall I dress it?
That's right, you were my surgeon.
Jesus.
Somebody must have shot you at close quarters, sir.
Kiemlicz! You'll come back under my command
How far are the troops who have mutinied against the Lord Hetman?
3 days by road.
Quicker through the woods.
Kiemlicz!
You'll come back under my command with your sons.
It'll pay off better than horse stealing.
Yes, yes, yes.
It's just hunger and misery.
Only don't try to betray me, you won't succeed.
That we'll never do.
Do you have something to write with?
I'll see.
I must send a letter, but through a reliable man.
We'll find one.
Where is he to go?
To the Lord Hetman but he doesn't need to see him.
It's enough if he delivers it to the first officer he meets.
I have three sheets.
But no ink and no pen.
The pen is here, and ink can be found.
Passable, it's easier to cut heads than pens.
Go away now, Mr Kiemlicz.
By God, it's true, he has our letters!
And there are things in them, that...
But Kmicic can't make these letters public, in doing so he'd pass a death sentence upon his girl.
He realizes it's the only way to keep us in check.
What girl is it?
Olenka Billewicz.
I don't ask her name, only if she's comely.
You don't know her.
Virtue personified, almost a nun.
I've known nuns too.
A defender of the Polish King.
Then we'll multiply his defenders.
Then Kmicic will disclose our secret.
I must guard her like the apple of my eye.
For the time being.
Then I'll give her to you, or even to your dragoons,
I don't care.
Invite her to supper tonight.
I'll have a look and decide if she's worthwhile.
But don't contradict me, whatever I say.
The Polish nobility, make me ashamed, when I compare them to foreign nobility.
A French gentleman can do the worst act.
But he won't raise his hand against his king.
Dear God!
What plots against our ex-king do you refer to?
Who tried to?
I met a certain gentleman on my way here.
That gentleman, not knowing my true sentiments for our king, he thought I was his enemy.
He promised to go to
Silesia to abduct the King for a reward, and deliver him dead or alive to the Swedes.
If he made me such an offer
I'd have him shot without judgment.
Your Grace alone can punish him.
Because he's your Colonel.
By God! My Colonel?!
Who is he?
Tell me!
His name is Kmicic.
That's not true!
If he's your relative or fiancé
I'm sorry to have told you this.
But I advise you to forget him for he's not worthy of you, miss.
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I was wrong to deny it.
That man is capable of anything.
Quiet!
That'll be... about ten horses.
Your Grace!
Have arms at the ready but don't shoot.
Who are you?
And you?
A patrol of confederated regiments.
We were sent to look for Swedes, and suspects.
It seems there are some here, if they won't answer.
Keep calm. Today one can't distinguish friend from foe.
We're going to the Confederates.
Is Colonel Wolodyjowski already in camp?
Perhaps he is but who's asking?
Wolodyjowski's friend.
Forgive me, Your Grace, for not recognizing your rank.
We're Wolodyjowski' soldiers, we'll take you to him.
Jesus! It's Kmicic! Get him!
Father, shall we thrash them?
Thrash them.
Stop!
Stop!
Surrender!
Tie them!
Take the horses and purses!
Take it all!
Hands off!
Holy Mary, it's ours!
Dress their wounds.
A brother's blood on my hands again.
Oh Christ show me the way or I shall surely lose my reason.
They're going against Radziwill...
It's a big force.
God grant them victory.
They've proclaimed me a villain and a traitor all over the country.
Nobody will trust Kmicic,
So, from now on, my name isn't Kmicic.
It is Babinicz, understand?
Yes, Colonel, sir.
Tell the men that even if they're flayed I'm Babinicz.
Where are we going, sir?
To the King.
Holy Mar)'-
But which king?
Not the Swedish one.
But His Majesty's taken refuge in Silesia.
We'll go to Silesia.
What have you decided?
To attack the Confederates with Swedish help.
Now, that's being a Radziwill!
The Swedes only respect the strong.
Go to Taurogi and muster as many men as you can.
Take the wench with you, but remember, if you rape her, it'll be the ruin of both of us.
It is my dearest wish to see you happy here.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Forgive me, my lady.
What's happened, Sakowicz?
Forgive us, my lady.
What happened there?
A spark fell on the powder.
And who caused the fireworks?
Braun did, My Grace.
Have the guilty man shot.
No,
Your Grace.
I beg you.
Yours only to order, not to beg.
I'd burn Taurogi for a single smile from you.
The Prince asks that you deign to accept this gift.
Give him my thanks.
Tell him I'm overjoyed with his gift.
And who are you, kind cavalier?
My name is Braun.
I'm the officer you saved from death.
I owe you my life.
I am at your command.
One more word, cavalier.
Your every word is a favour to me.
Do you know Kmicic?
I've only heard of him.
The Prince told me that Kmicic offered to abduct the Polish King.
Is it true?
I don't know, my lady.
But our officers told me that the Prince met Kmicic on his way to Kiejdany, and bought a horse from him.
The Prince came back very agitated.
It might have been then.
Must be an important Swede.
A general.
Stop.
I was sent to meet Your Excellency by the Swedish King who was anxious about the Imperial Envoy.
Sit down, sir.
Is victory still following
Charles Gustavus?
Some Polish troops have been dispersed, others have joined us.
A few cities and castles are still faithful to the Polish King.
Your Excellency, we are ready to go now.
I've heard the King of Sweden wants to take the Czestochowa Monastery.
His Imperial Majesty has a special sentiment towards this place.
There are orders to occupy all strongholds.
The gentry and peasants are already astir.
The Polish King is nearby in Silesia.
Where it is easy to stir up new revolts.
Excellency, the Monastery is a stronghold.
I am telling you what I heard.
The Swedes plan to attack the Monastery.
And soon this will happen.
You'd like us to believe your tidings.
Yes, by God.
What reward did you expect for it?
All this is my war booty.
I wanted to offer it to Holy Mary, but only after confession, with a clear conscience.
Truth shines through your anger.
But how could we drive the faithful out?
Keep the gates closed day and night?
Reverend Father.
As a soldier I advise you.
Make fast the walls, lock the gates.
For Christ's sake keep the gates locked.
Colonel, Your Grace, we've come to ask you to release us from service.
Don't you want to defend the Monastery?
Dogs!
Well, take your pay and away with you.
Don't touch it.
We're not worthy to look upon the splendours of Czestochowa.
Oh, Holy Virgin, Morning Star.
We're not worthy...
We're not worthy.
But we'll not stop serving you outside the walls.
We'll be your servants, sir, beyond them.
Away with you.
Your Grace, a messenger with important tidings from the Lord Hetman.
I'll receive him tomorrow.
No news from Prince Boguslav?
No, Your Grace.
And from the Swedish King?
The Confederates must have intercepted the letters.
Defeated and besieged,
I'm not needed by anyone.
Boguslav!
Boguslav!
Help.
What do you want?
Take that crown.
Help me.
People!
Jesus!
Where is the Prince?
Lower.
Fire!
Down!
Mad man! You could have been blown to powder!
What? Do we have too much powder?
Then you could load a gun with me and
I'd kill some Swedes after my death.
I didn't expect the clerics to have such officers.
May I ask your name?
Babinicz.
And I am Kuklinowski, an officer.
You must have heard of me.
My name and sword have won fame in many a war, not only in this country but also abroad.
Yes, I've heard of you.
Come on in.
No of fence to you, there are only two real soldiers in Poland.
Kuklinowski in the Kingdom and Kmicic in the Duchy of Lithuania.
The whole country has surrendered, the King has fled abroad.
We
Poles have come here with the Swedes to prevent sacrilege of this holy place when the Monastery falls.
And the Monastery must fall, they're bringing up heavy guns.
But how can we defend it it if you exasperate the enemy with your resistance.
It can only end in destruction of this holy church!
My brothers!
Reverend and beloved Fathers!
Don't have this on your conscience.
You didn't build this sanctuary and it is not only to serve you.
May it bring joy to our sons and grandsons.
I await your answer,
Reverend Fathers.
So you've failed?
Our priests are stubborn.
Between you and me, they're wrong.
We can't defend ourselves forever.
Yon think they're wrong?
You've got brains.
Show me through the gate,
I've something to tell you.
And I you.
All's burning under your feet, only fools stay in a burning house.
Perhaps you're afraid to be called a traitor?
Spit on them who call you that!
Join us!
Me, Kuklinowski, make you an offer.
Do you say that as the Swedish envoy?
I'm not an envoy outside the gate.
I'm speaking for myself.
To hell with this nasty fortress.
So you're speaking for yourself?
Yes.
And can I answer you as yourself?
Why certainly!
Then listen, Kuklinowski,
You're a scoundrel!
A villain and a stinking brute!
What?
A stinking brute!
Is that enough?
Or shall I spit in your face?
That's for you, not the envoy!
Our God he is our stronghold,
Our refuge and protection,
When the foe of truth divine,
Threatens it with destruction
Mother of God and yet virgin,
Blessed by the Lord, Maria,
Mother elected Maria, the Son, our God,
Pray obtain for us, let Him descend...
What do you want?
Father, the walls won't last more than one day.
Father, the culverin must be blown up.
Who's going to do it?
I Will.
Here's a sausage for you, doggy.
Who's there?
Me, Hans.
I'm looking for my ramrod.
Password?
Uppsala.
Hurry up, we're going to start firing soon.
Yes, I will hurry...
I know this bird
He's Babinicz from the Monastery garrison.
My name isn't Babinicz.
I am
Kmicic.
Kmicic?
It's a name famous throughout Poland.
General, he has no equal among soldiers, except perhaps me.
Kuklinowski, what do you want?
Do you want me to spare his life?
I want you to give him to me.
This is all I ask for my services.
Kuklinowski, do you want to save him?
Knacker!
All right, we can talk, we've time.
Kmicic, I told you there are only two real soldiers in this country.
Me and you.
The famous commander, Mr Kmicic, and Kuklinowski's got him, and will burn his sides.
Knacker!
Oh yes, he will burn his sides.
Well, how do you like it, darling?
Not too much right away.
Easy... We've got time.
Who the devil is it?
My Grace, General Miller wants to see you now, sir.
Oh, it's you, Kiemlicz.
All right.
Warm, wasn't it?
You can cool down a little now, darling.
I'll be back soon, for a chat.
Who's there?
We came to have a look.
Then look, you've not seen such a wonder before...
We've been looking for a chance since morning.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Go on! Cut the Colonel's bonds.
The horses are waiting.
How are you feeling, sir?
My legs are a little weak.
Some vodka will help.
Clothes for Mr. Colonel!
I feel better already.
He burnt my side, a little, but it's nothing.
Quick!
I'm all good already.
The horses are waiting.
Oh, no! It cannot be.
I'll stay and wait, for that traitor.
Kiemlicz! What the hell?
Are you mad?
Miller's asleep, they didn't let me in.
What is it?
An officer's waiting for
Your Grace in the stable.
Well, Mr Kuklinowski?
You wanted to be the equal of Kmicic, you scoundrel?
Be one of his company?
Meet Kmicic then!
I'll let you live, so that you can meditate on Kmicic.
Mount the horses. Let's go!
Where to, sir?
To Silesia!
To the King!
I do not say you lie, cavalier.
But if you spoke the truth, your side should be burnt.
Your majesty!
Let the doubting Thomases touch my wounds.
I do believe you.
I never doubted you were telling the truth.
Your merit and pain will not pass for nothing.
But many spies are sent here.
Prince Boguslav reported that an attempt on us was planned.
An attempt on Your Majesty?
We were reported there was a man who offered to abduct us.
And bring us dead or alive to the Swedes.
Who was it?
A certain Kmicic.
It's a lie.
It's a lie!
Prince Boguslav is a liar!
Don't believe that traitor,
Your Majesty!
He lied to disgrace his enemy!
Lift him up and call a doctor.
Your Grace,
God forbid that
I say anything against him,
But he shouldn't be trusted too readily.
Why shouldn't I trust a soldier who's shed his blood for our country and for us?
I haven't yet lost my throne if I have such defenders.
He'll stay with me.
But, Your Majesty...
Enough about this.
Let us discuss the matters I summoned you to.
We're going back to Poland.
Your Majesty, it results from various reports that the time is ripe to return and the King's presence may hasten the victory.
The Tartar Khan has promised his help if the King returns to the motherland.
You traitor!
Treason!
Wait!
For Christ's sake!
Escape, Your Majesty!
I'll hold them!
Kiemlicz,
Follow me!
Forgive me, my sons.
We forgive.
And you forgive us, Father.
I do.
Good people!
Do you know who you've just rescued?
This is your King, you have saved his life.
Your merits won't be forgotten.
Look for Babinicz!
To think you called him traitor!
It is my fault, Your Majesty.
Look for Babinicz!
I will not leave until
I look into his face.
He's still breathing!
Dear God, Babinicz, how shall I repay you?
I'm not Babinicz.
I'm
Kmicic.
You let the Polish King pass.
You let Czarnicki pass.
But Your Majesty...
Your Majesty always has to put his generals' blunders right.
Where is my beloved brother the Polish King now? Tell me!
Where are the Polish armies?
Any news of the enemy?
None, Your Majesty.
We only broke down some peasants and nobles.
Even if I have to chase my beloved royal brother all over Poland,
I'll catch him.
Here's to those who were the first to raise their swords against the traitor Radziwill.
We disobeyed orders for the first and God grant, for the last time.
We couldn't do otherwise.
Allegiance must have its limits, beyond which there is only guilt and crime.
Speaking of Your Majesty's safety,
It was heard from
Prince Boguslav's mouth that...
Was it about Kmicic?
Yes, Your Majesty.
None of that was true,
Boguslav was lying.
Call Babinicz.
But tell me what you know about the man.
He was a great soldier but terribly wild.
And he discredited himself in Kiejdany.
But he entreated Radziwill not to shoot us.
Really?
And Radziwill released you?
Mr Zagloba rescued us from captivity.
He drank with the officer saying he was his kin, took his clothes and went for my regiment.
Without boasting I did it.
Where did you get such wits?
It's a secret, but one must always carry with him hemp seeds and eat them little by Iitle.
It sharpens the wits enormously.
But Why?
There's oil in hemp and that oils the brain.
But the oil goes to your belly not to your brain.
I've got a method for that, too.
One must drink a lot of wine.
The oil, being lighter, floats on top.
The wine, going to one's head, carries it up.
What a shrewd fellow!
You'll find a few bottles in your rooms.
Jesus Christ!
Your Majesty! This is Kmicic!
You've known him as a brawler and Radziwill's ally.
And he's the hero of Czestochowa and my loyal servant, who shed his blood for me.
This is the new Kmicic.
Meet him and love him, he's worth it.
It was not me he wanted to abduct but Prince Boguslav.
Embrace him!
I have liked you from the start!
And I you!
What angel has converted you?
Did you find many people with the Hetman?
Just a few foreign officers.
By God,
I'm not asking about soldiers!
Boguslav took Miss Billewicz to Taurogi.
Woe!
She still loves that fellow Kmicic.
That's certain.
You're lucky to have me as your friend.
Tell me what the devil has whispered in your ear?
Tell me.
I'll be your best man, Your Majesty.
Don't fool, speak up!
There's a defrocked priest here.
What do I care?
He'll tack you together, but as he's a poor craftsman, not a member of the guild, it'll be easy to unpick the stitches.
Do you understand, Your Grace?
Dammit, I understand very well!
Charles Gustavus has summoned me.
I must go in a few days.
Haste will be the explanation why a paltry cleric marries you.
Some day you'll be hanged, Sakowicz.
It cannot be otherwise.
Quicker.
Close in!
I'm still weak.
We take the field today.
I envy you.
Your time will come, remember, sword practice every day, it won't be easy with Boguslav.
One of us is destined to die.
You bend your wrist too much.
A brother wouldn't do more for me.
Look how this candle burns.
What does it augur?
That virtue will melt tonight like wax.
If it could be done now!
If we could be married at midnight.
Put irons in the fire in case the Priest refuses.
It won't be necessary, he is a black villain.
So it'll be a villanous wedding.
Can't be otherwise where the best man's a pimp.
May I see Olenka?
Your Grace...
She says her grandfather's will forbids her to decide her fate.
And that she wouldn't marry Your Grace anyway.
Do you hear that, Sakowicz?
I scoff at your decisions and wills!
But we don't.
According to his last will, she must either take the veil or marry Kmicic.
Who?
Kmicic?
I'll give you Kmicic!
Shut up, you misfit.
Shut up, you withered old maid or I'll cut your sweet throat.
The girl attacked me, she had a dagger,
I knocked it out of her hand, as they taught me in ltalia...
Suddenly I felt a terrible pain, I fell into darkness, my head's still reeling.
The devil must be helping them.
Which of them practices witchcraft?
Not her, she's virtuous.
Perhaps the aunt.
That might be.
The foe has put fire and water between us and is scoffing at us.
Gentlemen!
He who loves God and his country - follow me!
Heir to the house of Genghis Khan, and master of great Hordes.
He will convey our secret thoughts to Your Majesty.
He is our servant and faithful dog who will obey Your Majesty to the death.
They'll start killing the innocent and burning homes.
Your Majesty, allow me to have these Tartars under my command.
I agree.
If the King sent you as a guide, you'll show me the way.
The King sent me as commander, not as a guide.
The Khan rules the Tartars, not the King.
Then listen to me, Aga.
The Khan gave you to the King like a dog.
So don't offend the King, or you'll be taken on a leash like a dog.
Don't irritate me!
Listen, you son of a goat!
You wanted freedom to plunder, burn and slaughter!
You wanted a guide?
Here's your guide!
Here's your guide!
Look at that, slave!
Give me another horse!
Your Worthiness, they won't cross the river.
Then it's no use hiding.
Lead us to attack, Babinicz!
Gentlemen, to your regiments!
Front to the river!
Fire at the ford!
Your Eminence,
I'd try that ford again.
Take the light cavalry, cross the river and attack the supply columns.
My Lord,
Kmicic will be killed!
If he has a head on his shoulders, he'll win, not die.
Now gm!
Cease fire!
That's what I wanted!
Don't kill me! The girl...
Speak up!
What did you do to her?
Spare me, I'll give her back.
I'd give a hundred rascals like you for one hair of hers.
But I don't believe you!
Traitor and perjurer!
I've given the order the order she will die if you kill me.
I'd sooner have expected death.
The devil gave orders to kill Olenka if he dies.
You've released a traitor to the Motherland!
Punish me, God, for my sins, not by my guilt, but by your mercy,
I'll never pass a sentence upon her!
What do you intend to do?
I'm going to Taurogi.
Charles Gustavus is gathering big forces,
I'll be back in two weeks.
Enough!
The Motherland won't perish in two weeks.
Miss Billewicz will bequeath you Wodokty, together with all the land she owns.
The Monastery will get everything you see here.
Are there many sheep?
Are you preparing to shear them already?
One will be enough for you.
Stop!
Stop!
Is he still alive, or dead?
Alive, but death hovers over him.
He was wounded by the Swedes.
He asked to be taken to Lubicz.
That's where he wants to die.
Hurry!
Lord, count in his favour that he's dying at the hand of the enemy.
Forgive him.
Have mercy on him.
Soroka?
At your service, sir.
Who is at
Wodokty?
The young lady.
Praise to God!
Did they ask about me?
Every day, until we told them that you're going to live.
And then they stopped?
Then they stopped.
What do you think of Kmicic, my daughter?
God knows that I don't want to think about him.
But he risked his life and shed his blood for his country.
When? When the foe was losing.
When he could profit by it.
What's of his contribution in this?
That's true, that's true.
Can a chance wound efface that?
I'd give everything for it not to be so.
But it's done and can't be undone.
Praise be to Jesus Christ.
For ever and ever.
We, Jan Kazimierz, King of Poland,
Grand Duke of Lithuania,
Masovia, Prussia etc. etc. etc.
In the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen.
We announce hereby to all that whatever guilt and punishment weighed upon Andrzej Kmicic, they must, considering his subsequent merits and glory be wiped away from human memory.
Andrzej Kmicic was beguiled and persuaded by Prince Radziwill, but saw his error and not only did he never promise to lift his hand against us, but abducted Prince Boguslav to avenge us and the ravaged Motherland.
God, have mercy on me!
Wounded by the Prince, he recovered and defended the Holy Shrine of Czestochowa, where he blew up the biggest
Swedish cannon.
Apprehended by the cruel foe his living flesh was burnt with fire.
Saved from this predicament by the Holy Virgin's power, he came to us, to Silesia, and during our journey back to the Motherland defending our person on the battlefield was found as dead.
Oh God, God!
And when he recovered owing to our care, he fought on, till the enemy was driven away from our country.
Therefore we, considering all his merits, have decided to proclaim them publicly, so that he no longer be persecuted by human hate, but may live in fame and be generally loved as is due to a good man.
Well, Olenka... well?
Jedrus,
I'm not worthy to kiss your wounds!
I'm speaking to you now, Andrzej!
It's not enough to risk your life, slaughter the enemy, so many men have been killed, now you must supply our beloved country with new defenders.
And I trust you won't lack the courage or the desire to do so.
Vivat!
I wish you every happiness, Colonel!
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Mmm, oh. Mmm, oh.
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.
Kuh, kuh, kuh, kuh, kuh.
A, E, I, O, U.
The ortolan is the name given to a European singing bird.
It is extremely rare.
When fattened for eating, they are left in dark cardboard boxes...
and packets of grain are pressed to a hole in the box...
through which a light is shone.
The bird picks desperately at the grain in the hope of penetrating through to the light...
which he mistakes for the sun.
This goes on for several weeks.
When it has eaten itself so full that it cannot stand or see...
it is drowned in cognac.
Gourmets regard it as an exceptional delicacy.
You will find vinegar is an acceptable substitute for cognac.
Stay there. Don't move.
Come on. Swim out.
Come on. Further.
Come on.
- Help! No!
- Stop.
- Swim back.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Now try. It's not far.
- Watch, Dad.
...although there are a few of them available in tins in the better shops now.
Give me the radio.
...so you have to learn to tell a fish knife from a meat knife...
and a fish fork from a meat fork.
If there's no fish knife and fork, use the smaller knife and fork for the fish.
- If you make a mistake, just continue eating.
- This one's red.
- Don't put the silver back on the table.
- This one's yellow.
Be nonchalant.
- The place for the napkin is on the lap.
- This one's brown with yellow stripes.
Please don't speak with your mouth full, Son.
The fish or meat will be served to you on your left side.
- This one's green. This one's white.
- Take the serving fork in your left hand...
and the serving spoon in your right.
- Oh, there's another red one.
- Don't eat chicken with your fingers except at a picnic.
You stopped again.
- Come back!
- He's all right.
Don't go out of sight!
We'll eat now.
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! You're dead!
I'm hot.
The wheel's come off.
Dad, my wheel's come off.
The wheel's come off.
- Chicken or ham?
- Both!
I think I know now what's making me sad
Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
- It's ready.
- Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang!
Quick, men! Duck!
Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
You're dead!
That's not fair!
He'll get away!
You're supposed to be on my side!
Shh. Come on.
What are you doing?
Come on.
And bring him with you.
It's getting late.
I've got to go now.
We can't waste time.
Come out now!
We have got to go now!
I... have got to go now.
Can't - Can't waste time.
We can't wa -
Come out now!
Stay here.
- What happened?
- He said we were to go on ahead.
He said I wasn't to go out of his sight.
He'll catch us up later.
Do you know where to go?
Yes, of course.
This way.
Who saw him die
I, said the fly
With my little eye
I saw him die
It's getting dark, isn't it?
Pass me that.
- Aren't you tired?
- A bit.
- Are we going to stay here all night?
- If you like.
Yes, please.
But we didn't bring any blankets.
I don't think I'm really tired yet.
Where are you going?
In the bushes.
Come what may, your life goes on
Lizards!
What you looking at?
I'm looking for a light.
Why? There won't be anybody there.
It's time you went to sleep.
We've got to be up early in the morning.
I'm going to sleep here.
Shall we take turns at being sentries?
- No.
- Oh.
We haven't even got any water, have we?
There's plenty of lemonade.
You can have some in the morning.
Are you all right?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Wasn't it nice last night?
- Did you like it?
- Yes.
- I had a dream.
- I know. You kept fidgeting.
- You're dropping everything.
- What?
The ammunition's falling out.
I tore my blazer.
It doesn't matter.
Come on.
- You won't tell Dad, will you?
- No.
What's up here?
We can see where we are from the top.
Well, where are we now?
We've just got to climb that one.
- But you said -
- Then we can see where we are.
- But you said -
- Come on. I'll race you.
Oh, crikey. My legs ache.
There's the sea!
It's the sea!
It is the sea, isn't it?
Maybe.
What sea is it?
What's its name?
I don't really know.
Beneath the granite and basaltic crust...
is the mantle of iron magnesium and possibly a sulfide-and-oxide shell...
an outer core of molten nickel iron -
You must have lost it when we were going up the cliff... to find out where we were.
- I told you it was all falling out.
- ...which means, one day, the world will end.
Are you sure it isn't in your satchel?
Yes.
Apart from the scientific explanation, the expectation that the world...
that is, that human society will someday come to an end -
- It isn't there.
- I've made a hole.
- Look.
- ...and that it is he who imparts dignity...
- Go on. Have a drink.
- and interest to the planet on which he lives...
- although not receiving importance from it.
- Leave some for me.
The idea that man has passed through 10,000 years of trial and suffering...
in order that there might be, at last, a perpetual succession of comfortable shopkeepers -
- I was listening.
- We mustn't waste the batteries.
Dad said they last for 400 hours.
- Are you hungry?
- Not yet.
- We ought to eat some salt.
- Why?
Uncle Ted said when they were soldiers in the desert... they always had to eat salt.
It doesn't taste salty.
- What are you doing?
- I mustn't step in those steps.
That means we won't get home by tonight.
I'm fed up.
No, you're not.
Come on.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
You walk on all the ridges, and I'll practice my voice lessons.
Puh, puh, puh.
Puh, puh, puh.
Puh, puh, puh, puh, puh.
Puh. Puh, puh, puh.
Puh, puh, puh.
Do you want a drink?
No. I'm not sweating now.
Oh, come back!
I can't walk down there!
It isn't fair!
Oh, please make him come.
I'm not coming back.
We've got to get on.
It's late.
I'm going now.
Please. Please try.
It can't be much further.
It's silly to give in now.
It's getting late.
We've got to go.
We can't waste time.
I'll carry you for a bit.
You're awake now.
What?
If you're awake, you should try and walk.
You should try and help me.
I'm tired too.
Look!
What's that?
- What?
- That.
Who'll sing a psalm
I, said the thrush
As she sat on a bush
I'll sing a psalm
You said you were too tired to walk.
It tastes lovely.
It's all right.
The birds are eating it.
It tastes like meat.
Today is Armistice Day.
And at 12:00, there will be a three-minute silence followed by a service of remembrance.
Meanwhile, we rejoin Captain Steele and Dusty, counteragents...
in another episode of Enemy.
If we make the bridge, Dusty -
Does drinking give you a big, red, fat nose?
- Why?
- I was just wondering.
Is that why Dad's nose is all freckly?
I don't know.
I've got a fly without any wings in my cap.
The bridge is blown!
Brake, Captain! Brake!
Did our car crash?
You must look after your blazer.
It's got to last.
Yes, skipper, I'm okay.
We don't want people thinking we're a couple of tramps.
What people?
Did Dad tear his clothes?
Perhaps that's why he sent us on.
And you've got a hole in your pocket.
- When are we going there?
- Where?
Back home.
In a few days.
That's the trouble with all these series.
You always know the superhero's gonna get away with it.
That's the trouble with Batman. and in The Saint.
You always know he's gonna win all the fights in the end.
That's the trouble with all these series.
Even Bugs Bunny wins all the time.
If we were superheroes, we would definitely win.
Yes.
- Are we superheroes?
- I don't know.
- I hope so.
- So do I.
We're lost, aren't we?
No, of course not.
Don't.
You'll ruin your nice shoes.
What happened?
Birds ate it all.
But they couldn't have drunk all the water.
Is there any in the bottle?
No.
Why didn't you fill it up?
We should have picked some fruit.
Which way are we going today?
I hope we find lots of sand.
I don't like climbing up those hills much.
They make my legs ache.
I don't suppose it matters which way we go.
We'll stay here.
Perhaps the water will come back.
Where from?
You shouldn't walk about in the sun.
It's bad for you.
Dad.
- I want a drink!
- Where are the others?
- You can't just go.
- Quick, stop him! He's getting away!
Oi! Oi!
Uh, we're English!
English!
Do you understand?
This is Australia, yes?
- Where is Adelaide?
- Ask him for water!
Water. Drink.
We want water to drink.
You must understand.
Anyone can understand that.
We want to drink.
I can't make it any simpler.
Water - to drink.
The water hole has dried up.
Where do they keep the water?
Water!
Who'll carry the link
I, said the linnet
I'll fetch it in a minute
I'll carry the link
Look! Look!
For what set of values for "X"...
is 4-3(X-4)...
equal to X-2(4-X)?
Write 24, 48 -
Seven fours are 28.
Eight fours are 32.
I can multiply 84 by 84.
I did it yesterday.
Divide 3,893 by -
- What is .5 of 12 minus a third?
- This is one of my soldiers.
Give your answer as a decimal.
Hey!
Put your shirt on.
- He hasn't got his shirt on.
- He hasn't got a shirt.
He can have mine.
It wouldn't fit him.
Leaving Adelaide at noon,
Harry drives at a steady speed -
That's a soldier.
- Give him one.
- No.
Don't be mean.
I expect he'd like to play.
He's never had any toys of his own.
I haven't got any.
Peter left his home at Mildura...
and cycled towards his uncle's house
50 miles away.
After one hour, traveling at 10 miles an hour...
he stopped for a drink, which took him -
Give me a piggyback!
Give me a piggyback!
Ow! No! No! No!
It's your own fault.
He'll roast you in blood and eat you for dinner.
Help! Help! Put me down!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Get up!
Hey! No!
I'm not coming down!
No! Get down! No!
Go on! It's great! Get up!
Go on! Get up! I did!
Pull!
Don't just hang there.
No. Carry me.
Jump! Jump!
Come on! Grab me!
Hurry!
Jump! It's my turn!
It's my turn now!
Come on! Jump!
Let me go!
Come on! Swing me!
Waldo's Motor Mart is in Allen Road,
Camperdown, next to the hospital.
If you've got a good, clean, low-mileage car you'd like to sell...
Waldo's Motor Mart will help you turn that car into cash.
And now, back to Night Beat.
Good night.
I'll be all right in the morning.
They got a bit sore from -
Oh, dear.
All right, let's go now.
Come out now!
And bring him with you.
Nothing can ever be created or destroyed.
Come on. It's my turn!
It's my turn now! Give me a go!
Every man and every woman is a star.
What can we know -
By the telescope, a faint -
I told you to keep your clothes on.
What?
No.
I'll show you how to do karate.
There's a pool down there.
So the boy said,
"I ought to be getting home from work."
He lived with his mother in a house on top of the hill.
She had never spoken to him.
He'd never heard her say a word.
He thought she was dumb, and she was blind too.
But every evening, when he came up the hill... he saw her sitting in the window, and she was talking.
But as soon as she heard his key in the lock, she'd stop.
And when he got inside, she wouldn't say a word.
So, one evening, he made up his mind to hear what she was saying.
- So he put the ladder -
- No, he went round the back.
Oh, yes. He went round the back and got the ladder.
- And he set it -
- He carried it.
Yes, he carried it round to the front of the house... and set it up against the window.
You didn't explain that she was sitting upstairs.
- I did.
- You didn't. You left it out.
Well, anyway -
I don't know why you're telling him all this.
He can't understand.
He doesn't know what a ladder is.
I expect we're the first white people he's seen.
It was very, very long and heavy... and he only just managed to get it in position in front of the house.
Next, he climbed up the ladder and got on the windowsill.
But he couldn't hear a word.
She was only a few feet away behind the window.
And her blind eyes were staring straight at him... and her mouth was opening and shutting.
But he couldn't hear because she was speaking silently to herself.
So he put his ear to the glass, but he still couldn't hear.
So he decided to come down.
But the windowsill was very narrow.
And when he turned round, he knocked the ladder down!
So he was stuck.
He couldn't jump down because it was too far... and he couldn't shout to his mother... because then she'd know he'd been spying on her.
So he just sat there.
It got dark, and because there wasn't very much room on the sill... his legs grew very stiff.
Sometimes, some people went past... but he couldn't shout to them for help because his mother would hear.
So, there was a drainpipe going down the wall... and the boy thought,
"If I reach across and get hold of that...
I'll be able to climb down."
So he reached across, but he slipped off the windowsill... and fell down and broke his neck.
I told you.
He doesn't understand.
Well, his mother went on sitting there and talking to herself... and she began to get worried because he was late home from work... and his dinner would get spoiled.
So she said -
No, she didn't.
She didn't say anything to him.
- She got up -
- Oh, that's right.
- and groped her way down the stairs -
- There's another aeroplane!
Do you think he understood when I drew this house?
That doesn't look like a house.
You can't draw.
That looks like a platypus walking in space.
Or a pterodactyl flying under the sea.
I think he might take us to the moon.
I wish we had a proper pencil.
Why did you say we were the first white people he's ever seen?
I always thought you had lots of crayons and pencils in your satchel.
Please have a look.
By the look of that,
I think he's gonna take us to Mars.
Ah, we won't find it, Hil.
Once them balloons get loose, they're away.
Perhaps.
Ah, you won't find that.
Look from time to time, please.
They're expensive, and I don't like to waste expensive things.
Sure. Sure.
Well, I better get back to me mud pies.
Well, I'll be off then.
You all right for smokes, Hil?
What?
On me.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Go on.
But that is three packets
I have to owe you.
Well, don't worry about it.
I'm trying to give it up.
Say, that's nice.
Hey! There goes another one!
Hey! Stop it!
Hey!
Hey, stop it!
So expensive.
Hey! Stop it!
Stop it!
Los Angeles
Los Angeles by morning is so fine
Hey, it's muddy in the water.
Especially in the early morning sunshine
It's muddy in the water.
There you'll be in front of me
So I'll catch up and turn to see you look my way
And smile
- We'll walk a while
- Please. Put me down.
New, shiny day, Los Angeles is fine
Los Angeles is fine
Especially in the early morning sunshine
How's it goin', boy?
I said, "How's things?"
You got ear trouble?
Suit yourself.
Move it. Go on. Quicker. Move it.
Stick 'em right over there.
That's right.
Get that bloody dingo out of here!
It's the last time I'm warning you!
Here.
Paint your titties with that.
Lovely.
Be careful with those.
They're valuable.
Oi, knock off.
Knock off for about 10 minutes.
And no sneakin' off.
We got a lot of work to do.
- You shut the door.
- The kids.
The window's open.
I'm hot.
Hey!
Look what I found!
Over here!
Come on!
That must be a weather balloon.
This black one's bigger.
And it's ticking.
I wonder where it came from.
Probably someone's listening to it.
Will it hurt me?
No, of course not.
How long will it take?
Ask him. Ask him how long it will be before we get anywhere.
Ask him how long.
Go on.
We'll be there today!
Hey!
There's lots of water out there.
- It's coming up out the ground.
- That's a spring.
He wants me to go and fetch some wood.
All right.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
...there's predestination or free will required.
We know now that that that is, is.
Water.
Water.
Water.
Yes, water.
Sorry, but that's all I could find.
I didn't - know where -
Where are we going?
It's a road!
It's a real road!
Where does it go?
You're making me drop my sticks.
I like these.
All right.
Hello.
Didn't I get a lot?
There's lots more there. Didn't I get a lot?
Where have you been? I -
Picking these.
He showed me where to get them.
Didn't I get a lot?
They're my favorites.
Remember?
- Where are you going?
- Out.
No. Stay here.
Here.
I've got lots of them.
Why won't he speak?
What's he dancing for?
I don't know.
Perhaps he's pleased.
Why?
Because we got here at last.
Where are you going now?
Aren't you hungry now?
Please leave him alone.
You haven't cooked the meat yet.
The radio's gone.
Oh.
The battery's gone.
No.
Dad said they last for 400 hours.
How long is that? It's longer than we've been walking, I bet.
Leave it.
We won't need it much longer.
Put it down and go to sleep.
I want to start early in the morning.
I think he wants to stay here.
- Why should he?
- It's nice.
I think that he wants to stay here for a while.
There's lots of those growing out there.
Anyway, I've already decided something.
We're going on our own tomorrow.
Why?
- That's best.
- No!
Suppose he wanted to do something or something happened?
Suppose he tried to -
Suppose he went off and left us.
No, he won't.
He likes being with us.
Won't go.
You must have dropped it.
Will he dance all night?
It's all right.
He won't keep you awake.
Can we go on the road?
What road?
Up there.
We found a road.
Didn't he tell you?
What sort of road?
A real road?
Yes.
Is that where we're going tomorrow?
Yes.
I knew we were getting somewhere.
He's not there.
He's not there!
He's not there!
I went to sleep.
He's gone.
Oh.
Where's he gone?
- He's gone home.
- Why?
Well, there was no reason for him to stay.
He just wanted to bring us to the road.
We must be near a town.
So he's gone back to his family.
Ahh! Ooh! Ooh!
It's lovely and warm.
- He didn't say good-bye to us.
- Yes, he did.
That's what the dance was about. It's their way of saying good-bye to people they love.
I'd love to have a warm bath with clean towels... and eat with real plates and knives and forks.
And have proper sheets... and records.
And clean my teeth properly... and wear all my own clothes.
I'm glad I washed your things.
We want to look nice when they find us.
Did you keep that button?
We must be near somewhere if there's a road.
I wanted to give him my penknife.
He's dead.
How?
I tried to give him my penknife, but he wouldn't take it.
That doesn't mean that he's dead.
He won't take it.
Should I see if the road's still there?
No, of course it's there.
Did you eat your breakfast properly?
Yes.
You should always sit down when you eat.
You shouldn't wander about.
You ready then?
There you are.
What are you thinking?
Shall we sit down for a bit?
Stop sulking.
Where's the radio?
You forgot it.
So what?
It didn't work.
It's time now for Hospital Requests.
You're listening to the first network of the ABC...
Radio 2BL Sydney, 2FC Newcastle.
The time is half past 8:00.
- Look!
- I know.
- Will Dad be there?
- No.
Ow!
Is he dead too?
I'm not sure.
Did he shoot himself?
It was an accident.
No, it wasn't.
- Then I don't know.
- Look.
- Did it hurt?
- Not much.
Well, why did he?
I suppose he thought he was doing the best thing.
Well, that's silly.
I said I don't know, didn't I?
All right?
- You ready?
- Yes.
- What's the name of that town?
- I don't know.
Morning.
Wait here. Hello?
Uh, excuse me!
Hello?
Hello?
I say, hello?
- Hello?
- Yes?
I'm sorry to trouble you.
We're lost.
We've had an accident in the desert.
Would you mind if -
- Put that down! Put that down!
- Please.
Put it down! Put that down!
- I have.
- This is all private property.
All this is private.
I'm an employee of the company.
- They own all this and the mine.
- What's the company?
You touch their cans and you'll soon find out.
- Where's the mine?
- It's shut.
- Oh? What was in it?
- Nothing. That's why they shut it.
Do people come through here?
- We get the tourists, same as anyone.
- When will they -
I don't know.
They never send me a card.
- Well, how often do they usually -
- I don't know. You'll have to wait.
- You'll find it down the road.
- What?
Where you're staying.
Don't touch anything.
Would you like to see the rest of the town?
We shan't have to wait long.
Someone will come soon.
Can we go and see the mines?
Yes, if you like.
- Can I go and play?
- Yes. Don't go far.
- Be careful.
- I'll be all right.
- What's there?
- Nothing.
- Hey!
- Yes?
Watch!
What?
Watch!
- Are you watching?
- Yes.
Well?
- What shall we do now?
- I know. Let's -
Hi, doll.
Well, they've made a decision.
I get Graham's job when he leaves Friday,
Ian takes over mine... and Robby and Alan go over to Accounts.
Which means old Mel looks like being out of a job.
Still, it's his own fault.
If you're gonna -
What?
Nothing.
Of course, with all this changing around... there's bound to be good news as far as salary's concerned.
I tell you, doll, in two years, we'll be holidaying on the Gold Coast... and shopping -
"Into my heart an air that kills...
"from yon far country blows.
"What are those blue remembered hills?
"What spires, what farms are those?
"That is the land of lost content.
"I see it shining plain.
"The happy highways where I went...
and cannot come again."
Tactical!

This is com station Epsilon 9 calling USS Columbia.
Come in, Columbia.
Respond, please.
This is Scout Columbia, Epsilon 9.
Could you boost your transmission?
This is Epsilon 9, Columbia.
Am boosting output.
How read you this?
Fine, fine. Thank you, Epsilon 9.
Receiving your transmission.
Scout Columbia, NCC-621... to rendezvous with
Scout Revere, NCC-595... on stardate 7411.4.
Further orders will be relayed at that time.
Signed Commodore Prober to Starfleet.
- End of transmission.
- Received. Thank you.
Our sensor drone is intercepting this on Quad L-1 4.
That's within Klingon boundaries.
Who are they fighting?
Unknown, Sir.
I have an exterior visual.
Attention!
Fire!
We've plotted a course on that cloud, Commander.
It will pass into Federation space fairly close to us.
Heading?
Sir, it's on a precise heading for Earth.
Commander Sonak.
You received your appointment as Enterprise science officer?
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Then why aren't you aboard?
Captain Decker requested I complete final science briefing here before...
- Here?
- we leave on our mission.
At Starfleet?
The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock.
Which will require
20 more hours at minimum...
Twelve.
I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura... which will not last more than three minutes.
Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Report to you, Sir?
It is my intention to be on that ship following that meeting.
Report to me in one hour.
- Admiral!
- Mr. Scott.
Those departure orders... 12 hours.
Starfleet cannot be serious.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters operating, Mr. Scott?
A wee problem, Sir.
Just temporary.
Admiral, we have just finished 18 months... redesigning and refitting the Enterprise.
How in hell do they expect me to have her ready in 12 hours?
Take me over, please.
She needs more work, Sir.
A shakedown!
Mr. Scott, an alien object of unbelievable destructive power... is less than three days away from this planet.
The only starship in interception range is the Enterprise.
Ready or not, she launches in 12 hours.
The crew haven't had near enough transition time... with all the new equipment.
And the engines...
They're not even tested at warp power.
And an untried Captain.
Two-and-a-half years as chief of Starfleet Operations... may have made me a little stale, but I... wouldn't exactly consider myself untried.
- They gave her back to me, Scotty.
- Gave her back, Sir?
I doubt it was that easy with Nogura.
You're right.
Well, any man who could manage such a feat...
I would not dare disappoint.
She'll launch on time, Sir, and she'll be ready.
- Thank you, Mr. Scott.
- Aye, Sir.
Cargo bay to launch crew.
A travel pod is now available at dock 6.
- Permission to come aboard, Sir.
- Granted, Sir.
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Commander Scott, you're needed in Engineering immediately.
Sir, you'll excuse me.
Flight deck, prepare for an incoming shuttlecraft.
If you'll follow me,
I'll show you...
I think I can find my way, Ensign.
Aye, Sir.
Bridge.
What's the problem?
I thought you people had that circuit patched in an hour ago.
We did. We had to disconnect it.
All right. Take out...
It's going to take us longer that way. We're trying to save time.
I'm still waiting for a check on the line. What's holding it up?
As soon as somebody can get to it.
What's the next program?
I'll get somebody down there as soon as I can, Cleary.
My people are all tied up now.
Captain! Starfleet just signaled your transfer of command orders.
- Captain.
- I appreciate the welcome.
I wish the circumstances were less critical.
Epsilon 9 is monitoring the intruder.
Keep a channel open to them.
Aye, Sir.
- Where's Captain Decker?
- He's in Engineering, Sir.
He... He doesn't know.
- Mr. Chekov.
- Aye, Sir.
Assemble the crew on the recreation deck at 0400 hours.
I want to show them what we're facing.
Check Cleary on number six.
- Need your cooler status.
- Stand by.
Space matrix restoration coils.
Dilithium crystals.
I knew it. The transporter sensor was not activated.
Air equalization.
Automatic off.
Faulty module.
Cleary, put a new backup sensor into the unit.
Aye, Sir.
Admiral Kirk! Well, we're getting a top brass send-off.
Don't worry, she'll launch on schedule... if we have to tow her out with our bare hands, right, Scotty?
Aye. That we will, Sir.
- Let's talk.
- Sure.
Let me know when that backup's ready.
All due respect, I hope this isn't some kind of Starfleet pep talk.
- I'm really too busy.
- I'm taking over the center seat.
You're what?
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
You'll stay on as executive officer.
Temporary grade reduction to Commander.
You personally are assuming command?
Yeah.
- May I ask why?
- My experience.
Five years out there dealing with unknowns like this.
My familiarity with the Enterprise and its crew.
Admiral, this is an almost totally new Enterprise.
You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
That's why you're staying aboard.
I'm sorry, Will.
No, Admiral,
I don't think you're sorry.
Not one damn bit.
I remember when you recommended me for this command.
You told me how envious you were and how much you hoped... you'd find a way to get a starship command again.
Well, Sir, it looks like you found a way.
Report to the bridge,
Commander, immediately.
Aye, Sir.
Transporter room!
Come in! Urgent!
Redline on the transporter,
Mr. Scott!
Transporter, do not engage!
-It's too late. They're beaming now.
- Do not...
Do you read me, Starfleet?
Override it! Pull them back!
Unable to retrieve their pattern,
Enterprise.
Give it to me.
Starfleet, boost your matter gain.
We need more signal.
More signal!
- We're losing their pattern!
- Oh, no, they're forming.
Oh my God.
Starfleet, do you have them?
Enterprise, what we got back didn 't live long, fortunately.
Starfleet, Kirk.
Please express my condolences to their families.
Commander Sonak's can be reached through the Vulcan embassy.
There was nothing you could have done, Rand.
It wasn't your fault.
Yeoman, turboshaft 8?
Back that way, Sir.
We have to replace
Commander Sonak.
I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible.
None available, Captain.
In fact, there's no one who's fully rated on this design.
You are, Mr. Decker.
I'm afraid you're going to have to double as science officer.
That's all we know about it... except that it is now
53.4 hours away from Earth.
Enterprise is the only Federation starship that stands in its way.
Our orders are to intercept... investigate and take whatever action is necessary... and possible.
Bridge to Captain.
Priority signal from Epsilon 9.
- Put it on viewer.
- On viewer, Sir.
Enterprise, the cloud is definitely a power field of some kind.
Measures... My God... over eight two AU's in diameter.
Must be something incredible inside there generating it.
We're transmitting lingua code friendship messages... on all frequencies.
No response. have a null reading at the center of the cloud.
Definitely something inside there, but scans are being reflected back.
- Some kind of power surge.
- Receiving an odd pattern now.
Enterprise, they could be mistaking our scans as a hostile act.
They seem to be reactingto our scans, Sir.
Deflectors, emergency full!
- We are under attack.
- External view.
Viewer off.
Viewer off.
Prelaunch countdown will commence in 40 minutes.
Transporter system fully repaired and functioning normally, Sir.
Dock signals clear, Captain.
Reply we are holding position, awaiting final crew replacements.
Aye, Sir.
Transporter personnel reports... the navigator, Lieutenant Ilia...
She's already aboard and en route to the bridge, Sir.
She's Deltan, Captain.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, Sir.
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
- Hello, Ilia.
- Decker.
I was stationed on the lieutenant's home planet some years ago.
Commander Decker?
Yes, our exec and science officer.
Captain Kirk has the utmost confidence in me.
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
My oath of celibacy is on record, Captain.
- May I assume my duties?
- By all means.
Starfleet reports our last six crew members are ready to beam up... but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter.
Oh? I'll see to it that he beams up.
Transporter room.
Well, for a man who swore he'd never return to Starfleet...
Just a moment, Captain, Sir.
I'll explain what happened.
Your revered Admiral Nogura invoked a little-known... seldom-used reserve activation clause.
In simpler language, Captain, they drafted me!
They didn't.
This was your idea.
This was your idea, wasn't it?
Bones, there's a thing out there.
Why is any object we don't understand always called a thing?
Headed this way. I need you.
Damn it, Bones, I need you.
Badly!
Permission to come aboard.
Permission granted, Sir.
Well, Jim,
I hear Chapel's an MD now.
Well, I'm going to need a top nurse... not a doctor who will argue every little diagnosis with me.
And they probably redesigned the whole sick bay too!
I know engineers.
They love to change things.
Dock control reports ready, Sir.
- Helm ready, Sir.
- Orbital departure on plot, Sir.
Yard command signaling clear, Sir.
- Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
- Maneuvering thrusters, Sir.
Hold station.
Thrusters at station-keeping, Sir.

Captain 's Log.:
Stardate 7412.6...
1.8 hours from launch.
In order to intercept the intruder at the earliest possible time... we must now risk engaging warp drive while still within the solar system.
Captain, assuming we have full warp capability... accelerating to warp 7 on leaving the solar system... will bring us to IP with the intruder in 20.1 hours.
Science Officer competition.
Confirm, Sir
Well, Bones, do the new medical facilities meet with your approval?
They do not. It's like working in a damn computer center.
- Programming ready?
- Set for standard warp entry.
But I still recommend further simulation study.
Mr. Decker, every minute brings that object closer to Earth.
Engineering, stand by for warp drive.
Captain, we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors.
Engineer, we need warp speed now!
Jim, you're pushing.
Your people know their jobs.
That's it, Sir.
I can't do any better.
Aye, lad.
It's borderline on the simulator.
I cannot guarantee she'll hold up.
Warp drive, Mr. Scott.
- Ahead warp 1 , Mr. Sulu.
- Accelerating to warp 1, Sir.
Warp .7, .8.
Warp 1 , Sir.
Mr. Decker...
Wormhole. Get us back on impulse power. Full reverse.
Negative helm control, Captain.
Going reverse on impulse power.
Subspace frequencies jammed, Sir!
Wormhole effect!
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22.5 seconds... before forward velocity slows to sublight speed.
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us.
- Directly ahead.
- Force fields up full.
Put object on viewer.
- Go manual override on helm.
- No manual response, Sir.
Navigational deflectors coming up, Sir.
Wormhole distortion has overloaded the main power systems.
Navigational deflectors inoperative, Captain.
Directional control also inoperative.
Time to impact?
Twenty seconds.
Mr. Chekov, stand by on phasers.
No!
Belay that phaser order!
Arm photon torpedoes!
Photon torpedoes... armed!
Object is an asteroid.
Reading mass .7.
Targeting... asteroid!
Impact in ten seconds.
Impact in eight seconds.
- Fire torpedoes!
- Six!
Torpedoes away!
Five!
Helm control restored, Sir.
- Position report, Navigator.
- Computing new intersection course.
Communications are normal, Sir.
Negative damage reported, Captain.
No casualties reported, Doctor.
Wrong, Mr. Chekov.There are casualties.
My wits, as in
"frightened out of," Captain, Sir.
We were at warp .8.
Engineer, report your status there.
In just a second, Exec. We're picking up the pieces down here.
Mr. Scott, we need warp drive as soon as possible.
The engine imbalance created the wormhole in the first place.
It'll happen again if we don't correct it.
That object is less than two days away from Earth.
We need to intercept while it still is out there.
Lay in a heading to conform with our initial IP with the intruder.
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.
Mr. Decker.
-I'd like to see you in my quarters.
-Mind if I tag along, Captain?
Level 5.
All right, explanation. Why was my phaser order countermanded?
The Enterprise redesign increases phaser power... by channeling it through the main engines.
When they went into antimatter imbalance... the phasers were automatically cut off.
Then you acted properly, of course.
Thank you, Sir.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
- You saved the ship.
- I'm aware of that, Sir.
Stop competing with me, Decker.
- Permission to speak freely, Sir?
- Granted.
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two-and-a-half years.
That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's redesign... in my opinion, Sir, seriously jeopardizes this mission.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties?
Yes, Sir, I'll do that.
Then I won't keep you from your duties any longer, Commander.
- Yes, Doctor?
- Aye, Sir.
He may be right, Jim.
- Was it difficult?
- No more than I expected.
About as difficult as seeing you again.
- I'm sorry.
- That you left Delta IV?
Or that you didn't even say good-bye?
If I had seen you again... would you have been able to say it?
No.
Make your point, Doctor.
The point, Captain, is that it's you who is competing.
You rammed getting this command down Starfleet's throat.
You've used this emergency to get the Enterprise back.
And I intend to keep her, is that what you're saying?
Yes.
It's an obsession.
An obsession that can blind you... to far more immediate and critical responsibilities.
Your reaction to Decker is an example, Jim.
- Bridge to Captain.
- Viewer on.
Signal from a Federation registered long-range shuttle, Sir.
She wishes to come alongside and lock on.
For what purpose?
My security scan shows it has a grade-one priority, Captain.
Non belligerency confirmed.
I suspect it is a courier of some kind.
Very well, Mr. Chekov.
See to it.
Viewer off.
Your opinion has been noted.
Anything further?
That depends on you.
Security scan.: one boarder.
Identity: Starfleet, inactive.
- Permission to come aboard, Sir.
- Granted, Sir.
Gran... ted.
Why... Why, it's Mister...
Spock!
Spock.
Commander, if I may?
If... Oh.
I've been monitoring your communications with Starfleet.
I'm aware of your engine design difficulties.
I offer my services as science officer... with all due respect,
Commander.
- If our exec has no objections.
- Of course not.
I'm well aware of
Mr. Spock's qualifications.
Mr. Chekov, log Mr. Spock's
Starfleet commission reactivated.
List him as science officer.
Both effective immediately.
Mr. Spock.
Well, so help me,
I'm actually pleased to see you.
It's how we all feel, Mr. Spock.
Captain, with your permission...
I will now discuss these fuel equations with the engineer.
Mr. Spock.
Welcome aboard.
Captain 's Log.:
Stardate 7413.4.
Thanks to Mr. Spock's timely arrival and assistance... we have the engines rebalanced into full warp capacity.
Repair time.: less than three hours.
Which means we will now be able to intercept intruder... while still more than a day from Earth.
Warp .8.
Warp 2, Sir.
Warp 3.
Warp 4.
Warp 5.
Warp 6.
Warp 7.
Science Officer Spock, reporting as ordered, Captain.
Please, sit down.
Spock, you haven't changed a bit.
You're just as warm and sociable as ever.
Nor have you, Doctor... as your continued predilection for irrelevancy demonstrates.
Gentlemen.
At last report, you were on Vulcan... apparently to stay.
Yes, you were undergoing the ''Kolanear'' discipline.
Sit down.
If you are referring to the
Kolinahr, Doctor, you are correct.
Well, however it's pronounced,
Mr. Spock, it's the Vulcan ritual... that's supposed to purge all remaining emotions.
The Kolinahr is also a discipline you broke to join us.
Will you, please, sit down?
On Vulcan I began sensing a consciousness... from a source more powerful than I have ever encountered.
Thought patterns of exactingly perfect order.
I believe they emanate from the intruder.
I believe it may hold my answers.
Isn't it lucky for you that we just happened to be heading your way?
Bones!
We need him.
I need him.
Then my presence is to our mutual advantage.
Any thought patterns you might sense... whether they appear to affect you personally or not...
I expect immediately reported.
Of course, Captain.
- Is there anything else?
- No.
Jim?
If this super intelligence... is as important to him as he says it is, how do we know...
That he wouldn't put his own interests ahead of the ship's?
I could never believe that.
Bridge to Officers' Lounge.
Captain Kirk.
Revised estimate on cloud visual contact.:3.7minutes.
Standard light, Engineer.
- Full mag on viewer.
- Full mag, Sir.
Lingua code?
Continuing friendship messages on all frequencies, Sir.
All decks and divisions confirmed.
Status red.
Captain, we are being scanned.
Do not return scan, Mr. Spock.
It could be misinterpreted as hostility.
Intruder scans emanating from the exact center of the cloud.
Energy of a type... never before encountered.
There's no response to friendship messages, Sir.
- Shall I go to battle stations?
- Negative.
We'll take no provocative action.
Recommend defensive posture,
Captain. Screens and shields.
No, Mr. Decker, that could also be misinterpreted as hostile.
Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
- Twelfth-power energy field.
- Twelfth-power?
We've seen what their weapons can do.
Shouldn't we take every precaution?
- Mr. Decker...
- Captain.
I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack.
If that order isn't clear enough...
Captain, as your exec it's my duty... to point out alternatives.
Yes, it is.
I stand corrected.
Five minutes to cloud boundary.
Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path to the cloud center.
Bring us parallel to whatever we find in there.
Mr. Sulu, tactical plot on viewer.
Tactical on viewer, Sir.
That measures 12th-power energy?
Thousands of starships couldn't generate that much...
Mr. Spock?
Spock, tell me.
I sense... puzzlement.
We have been contacted.
Why have we not replied?
Contacted?
How?
Force fields up full.
Deflectors, now.
Force fields and deflectors up full, Captain.
Analysis, Mr. Spock.
Alien weapon is a form of plasma energy, Captain.
Exact composition unknown.
Guidance system unknown.
All decks, brace for impact.
Engineering, status report.
Systems overloading, Captain.
Medic.
Medics are coming.

Cannot hold full power on force fields.
Deflector power is down 70 percent.
Divert auxiliary power to deflectors.
Captain.
The intruder has been attempting to communicate.
I am now programming our computer... to transmit lingua code at their frequency and rate of speed.
Commander.
Spock!
Here it comes.
Engineering, what's happening to our force field?
Our shields cannot handle another attack.
Mr. Spock.
Impact in 20 seconds
Spock.
Fifteen seconds.
Spock, transmit now.
Ten seconds.
Transmitting.
It would seem our friendship messages... have been received and understood, Mr. Spock.
I would say that was a logical assumption, Captain.
Mr. Sulu, hold present position.
Holding present position, Sir.
Tactical plot on viewer.
Course projection on tactical, Sir.
Opinion, Mr. Spock.
Recommend we proceed, Captain.
- Mr. Decker?
- I advise caution, Captain.
We can't withstand another attack.
That thing is 20 hours away from Earth.
- We know nothing about it as yet.
- Precisely the point, Captain.
We don't know what it'll do.
Moving into that cloud at this time... is an unwarranted gamble.
How do you define ''unwarranted''?
You asked my opinion, Sir.
Viewer. Standard ahead.
Navigator, maintain course.
Helmsman... steady as she goes.
No vessel could generate a power field of this magnitude.
Spock.
Instruments fluctuating,
Captain.
Patterns unrecognizable.
Transmit image of alien to Starfleet.
Advise we are attempting further communication.
Unable to make contact with Starfleet, Captain.
Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud is being reflected back.
We are closing on it rapidly, Captain.
Reduce magnification factor four, Mr. Sulu.
We are already two settings below that, Sir.
Mr. Sulu... bring us into a parallel course... over the alien... at 500 meters.
Five hundred meters?
Then take us out to 100 kilometers distance... adjusting parallel course.
Aye, Sir.
Viewer astern.
Reverse angle on the view,
Captain.
Five hundred meters.
Viewer ahead, Sir.
Hold relative position here.
Mr. Spock!
Can that be one of their crew?
A probe from their vessel,
Captain.
Plasma-energy combination.
Don't interfere with it.
Absolutely, I will not interfere.
No one interfere.
It doesn't seem interested in us.
Only the ship.
Computer off.
It's taking control of the computer.
It's running our records...
Earth defenses, Starfleet strength.
Ilia!
Ilia!
This is how I define ''unwarranted.''
Activate auxiliary computer circuits through manual shutoff.
Captain, we've been seized by a tractor beam.
Get someone up here to take the navigator's station.
- Engineering.
- Chief DiFalco, to the bridge.
- Emergency power.
- Going to full emergency.
But, Captain, if we don't break free in 15 seconds, she'll burn up.
We cannot break free, Captain.
We have only a fraction of the power necessary.
Engineering, belay that order.
Disengage all main drive systems.
Chief DiFalco, take over Lieutenant Ilia's station.
DiFalco, disengage engine navigation relays now.
Aye, Sir.
Force field circuits
E-10 through 14... show ready for reactivation.
Confirm, please.
Scotty, drive systems should be free now.
Commander?
Ready to launch remote communications drone... with complete ship's records... including our present situation, Sir.
Delay launching as long as possible.
Our drone can't escape as long as we're held in their tractor.
Aye.
Captain, a maximum phaser strike directly at the beam... might weaken it just enough for us to break free.
Break free to where, Commander?
Any show of resistance would be futile, Captain.
We don't know that, Mr. Spock.
Why are you opposed to trying?
Why bring us inside?
Not to destroy us.
They could have done that outside.
They still can.
Curiosity, Mr. Decker.
Insatiable curiosity.
Captain, photic sonar readings indicate the aperture is closing.
We're trapped, Sir.
Reverse angle on the viewer,
Captain.
Tractor beam has released us,
Captain.
Confirmed.
Vessel is floating free.
No forward momentum.
Viewer ahead.
Viewer ahead, Sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Ahead one third.
Thrusters ahead one third.
Let's take a look.
Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock.
They can't expect us not to look them over now.
Now that we're looking down their throat.
Right, now that we've got them just where they want us.
It's closing up.
Hold position.
Captain.
All our scans are being reflected back.
Sensors are useless.
Damn.
What do you make of all this?
I believe the closed orifice leads to another chamber... undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism.
I suspect it may be necess...
Intruder alert!
Deck 5. Officer's quarters.
Have Security meet me at deck 5, main elevator.
Spock.
Mr. Decker, you have the com.
Hold positions.
You are the Kirk unit.
You will assist me.
I have been programmed by V'Ger... to observe and record... normal functions of the carbon-based units... infesting USS Enterprise.
-Jim, what's going on?
- Tricorder.
Who is...
V'Ger?
V'Ger is that which programmed me.
Is V'Ger the name of the Captain of the alien vessel?
Jim.
This is a mechanism.
A probe, Captain.
No doubt a sensor-transceiver combination... recording everything we say and do.
Where is Lieutenant Ilia?
That unit no longer functions.
I've been given its form... to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units... infesting Enterprise.
Carbon-based units?
Humans, Ensign Perez.
Us.
Why does V'Ger travel... to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
To find the creator.
Find the creator?
Whose...
What does V'Ger want with the creator?
To join with him.
To join with the creator? How?
V'Ger and the creator will become one.
And who is the creator?
The creator is that which created V'Ger.
Who is V'Ger?
V'Ger is that which seeks the creator.
I'm ready to commence my observations.
Doctor, a thorough examination of this probe... might provide some insight into those who manufactured it... and how to deal with them.
Fine.
Let's get her to sick bay.
I'm programmed to observe and record... only the normal functioning of the carbon-based units.
The, uh... examination is a normal function.
You may proceed.
Micro-miniature hydraulics... sensors... and molecule-sized multiprocessor chips.
And take a look at this.
An osmotic micropump, right here.
Even the smallest body functions are exactly duplicated.
Every exocrine system is the same, too... even eye moisture.
Decker.
Fascinating.
Not ''Decker unit.''
Gentlemen.
Will.
- What happened to her?
- Captain.
This probe may be our key to the aliens.
- Probe? Ilia?
- Exactly.
It is a programmed mechanism,
Commander.
Its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail.
Suppose that, beneath its programming... the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
- They had a pattern to follow.
- Indeed.
They may have followed it too precisely.
Ilia's memory... her feelings of loyalty, obedience, friendship... might all be there.
You did have a relationship with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
That probe, in another form, is what killed Ilia.
Commander...
Will, we're locked in an alien vessel... six hours from Earth's orbit.
Our only contact with our captor is that probe.
If we can control it, persuade it, use it...
I have recorded enough here.
You will now assist me further.
The, uh...
Decker unit can assist you with much greater efficiency.
Carry on with your assignment,
Mr. Decker.
Aye, Sir.
I am concerned with that being our only source of information, Captain.
Captain's Log:
Stardate 7414.1.
Our best estimates place us some four hours from Earth.
No significant progress thus far... reviving Ilia memory patterns within the alien probe.
This remains our only means of contact with our captor.
All those vessels were called Enterprise.
The carbon units use this area for recreation.
This is one of the games.
What types of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy?
The words ''recreation''... and ''enjoy''... have no meaning to my programming.
Ilia enjoyed this game.
She nearly always won.
Good. He's using audiovisual association.
This device serves no purpose.
Why does Enterprise require the presence of carbon units?
Enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary... before carbon units can be patterned... for data storage.
What does that mean?
When my examination is complete... all carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
Within you... are the memory patterns of a certain carbon unit.
If I can help you to revive those patterns... you could understand our functions better.
That is logical.
You may proceed.
I remember Lieutenant Ilia once mentioning she wore that.
On Delta.
Remember?
Ilia.
Dr. Chapel.
Will?
Ilia.
Commander.
Commander.
This is a mechanism.
Ilia... help us make direct contact with V'Ger.
I cannot.
This creator V'Ger is looking for... what is it?
V'Ger does not know.
Computer, commence recording.
Captain Kirk, these messages will detail my attempt... to contact the aliens.
I intend to calculate thruster ignition and acceleration rate... to coincide with the opening of the V'Ger orifice.
This should facilitate a better view... of the interior of the alien spacecraft.
Captain, Starfleet signals are growing in strength, Sir.
They still have the intruder on their monitors.
- It's decelerating.
- Confirmed, Sir.
Lunar beacons indicate intruder on a course into Earth orbit.
Sir, air lock 4 has been opened.
A thruster suit is reported missing.
A thruster suit?
That's Spock.
Damn him.
Bring him back here.
No, wait.
- Get a fix on his position.
- Aye, Sir.
I have successfully penetrated... the next chamber of the alien's interior... and I'm witnessing some sort of dimensional image... which I believe to be a representation... of V'Ger's home planet.
I'm passing through a connecting tunnel.
Apparently, a kind of plasma-energy conduit.
Possibly a field coil for a gigantic imaging system.
Curious.
I'm seeing images of planets, moons, stars... whole galaxies all stored here, recorded.
It could be a representation of V'Ger's entire journey.
But who or what... are we dealing with?
The Epsilon 9 station, stored here with every detail.
Captain, I am now quite convinced... that all of this is V'Ger... that we are inside a living machine.
Ilia.
The sensor... must contain some special meaning.
I must try to mind-meld with it.
Spock.
Spock!
Spock.
Now scanning pons area at spinal nerve fiber connection.
Indications of some neurological trauma.
The power pouring through that mind-meld must have been staggering.
Spock.
Jim.
I should have known.
Were you right... about V'Ger?
A life-form of its own.
A conscious, living entity.
A living machine?
It considers the Enterprise a living machine.
That's why the probe refers to our ship as an entity.
I saw V'Ger's planet.
A planet populated by living machines.
Unbelievable technology.
V'Ger has knowledge that spans this universe.
And yet... with all its pure logic...
V'Ger is barren... cold.
No mystery.
No beauty.
Should have known.
Known?
Known what? Spock.
What should you have known?
What should you have known?
Jim... this... simple feeling... is beyond V'Ger's comprehension.
No meaning, no hope.
Jim... no answers.
It's asking questions.
''Is this... all that I am?
Is there nothing more?''
Bridge to Captain.
Kirk here.
A faint signal from Starfleet, Sir.
Intruder cloud has been located on their outer monitors... for the past 27 minutes.
Cloud dissipating rapidly as it approaches.
Starfleet reports forward velocity has slowed to sub-warp speed.
We are three minutes from Earth orbit.
I'll be right there.
I need Spock on the bridge.
Dalaphaline, five cc's.
A machine planet... sending a machine to Earth.. looking for its creator.
It's absolutely incredible.
Mr. Chekov.
Commander Decker present location.
They are in the engineering, Sir.
Captain, Starfleet is sending this tactical on V'Ger's position.
V'Ger is transmitting... a signal.
Jim.
From V'Ger.
V'Ger signals the creator.
Spock?
A simple binary code... transmitted by carrier wave signal.
Radio.
Radio?
Jim.
V'Ger expects an answer.
An answer?
I don't know the question.
The creator has not responded.
All planetary defense systems have just gone inoperative.
Sir, Starfleet computes the devices are proceeding... toward equidistant positions orbiting the planet.
They're the same things that hit us.
They are hundreds of times more powerful, Captain.
From those positions... they could devastate the entire surface of the planet.
Why?
The creator has not answered.
The carbon unit infestation is to be removed from the creator's planet.
Why?
You infest Enterprise.
You interfere with the creator in the same manner.
V'Ger
V'Ger
Captain.
V'Ger is a child.
I suggest you treat it as such.
- A child?
- Yes, Captain.
A child... evolving, learning, searching... instinctively needing.
- Needing what?
- Spock.
This child is about to wipe out every living thing on Earth.
Now, what do you suggest we do?
Spank it?
It knows only that it needs,
Commander.
But, like so many of us... it does not know what.
The carbon units know why the creator has not responded.
Disclose the information.
Not until V'Ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Captain.
I'm losing Starfleet.
Interference from V'Ger.
Kirk unit, disclose the information.
Why has the creator not responded?
No.
Secure all stations.
Clear the bridge.
Clear the bridge, Captain?
- That was the order, Mr. Sulu.
- Clear the bridge  - Aye, Sir.
Your child is having a tantrum,
Mr. Spock.
V'Ger requires the information.
Bridge, secure all stations.
Move out.
Jim, what the hell kind of strategy is this?
All ship's functions going to automatic, Captain.
If V'Ger destroys the Enterprise... the information that V'Ger requires will also be destroyed.
It is illogical to withhold required information.
Kirk unit!
Kirk unit.
Why do you not disclose information?
Because V'Ger's going to destroy all carbon units on the third planet.
They have repressed the creator.
The information will not be disclosed.
V'Ger needs the information.
Then V'Ger must withdraw all the orbiting devices.
V'Ger will comply... if the carbon units will disclose the information.
It learns fast, doesn't it?
Captain, the vessel... V'Ger... obviously operates from a central brain complex.
The orbiting devices would be controlled from that point, then.
Precisely.
The carbon unit's information cannot be disclosed to V'Ger's probe... but only to V'Ger directly.
Forward motion, Captain.
Tractor beam.
Captain, what's the next move?
The question is, Mr. Decker... is there a next move?
Resume duty stations.
All personnel, resume stations.
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff has been called.
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices reach final position?
Twenty-seven minutes. Mark.
Captain, I believe that is our destination.
Forward motion slowing, Captain.
I read an oxygen-gravity envelope forming outside the Enterprise.
Forward motion stopped, Captain.
V'Ger.
Sir, I've located the source of V'Ger's radio signal.
It's directly ahead.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'Ger and its creator.
The carbon units will now provide V'Ger... with the required information.
Mr. Spock. Bones.
Mr. Decker, I will contact you every five minutes.
Captain.
I'd like to go along.
Mr. Sulu, you have the com.
V'Ger.
''V... G-E-R.''
V'Ger.
''V-O-Y-A-G-E-R.''
Voyager.
Voyager 6.
NASA. National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Jim... this was launched more than 300 years ago.
Voyager series.
Designed to collect data... and transmit it back to Earth.
Captain...
Voyager 6 disappeared into what they used to call a black hole.
It must have emerged on the far side of the galaxy... and fell into the machine planet's gravitational field.
The machine inhabitants found it to be one of their own kind... primitive, yet kindred.
They discovered its simple
20th-century programming... collect all data possible.
Learn all that is learnable.
Return that information to its creator.
Precisely, Mr. Decker.
The machines interpreted it literally.
They built this entire vessel... so that Voyager could actually fulfill its programming.
And on its journey back... it amassed so much knowledge... it achieved consciousness itself.
It became a living thing.
Kirk unit.
V'Ger awaits the information.
Enterprise... order up the ship's computer library records... on the late 20th-century
NASA probe Voyager 6.
Specifically, we want the old NASA code signal... that instructs the probe to transmit its data.
- And fast, Uhura, fast.
-Aye, Sir.
That's what it's been signaling... its readiness to transmit its information.
And there's no one on Earth... who could recognize the old signal and send a response.
The creator does not answer.
V'Ger.
V'Ger.
V'Ger!
We are the creator.
That is not logical.
Carbon units are not true life-forms.
We will prove it.
We will make it possible for you to complete your programming.
Only the creator could accomplish that.
Enterprise?
We have just received the response code, Captain.
Set the Enterprise transmitter on appropriate frequency... and transmit the code now.
Transmitting. and the final sequence.
That should trigger
Voyager's transmitter.
Voyager is not transmitting its data, Captain.
The creator must join with V'Ger.
Uhura, repeat the final sequence.
The creator must join with V'Ger.
Voyager is not transmitting,
Captain... because it did not receive the final sequence.
Jim, we're down to ten minutes.
Enterprise, stand by.
- The antenna leads are melted away.
- Yes, Captain, just now.
By V'Ger itself.
- Why?
- To prevent reception.
Of course.
To bring the creator here.
To finish transmitting the code in person.
To touch the creator.
Capture God?
V'Ger's liable to be in for one hell of a disappointment.
Perhaps not, Doctor.
Captain.
V'Ger must evolve.
Its knowledge has reached the limits of this universe. It must evolve.
What it requires of its god, Doctor, is the answer to its question...
Is there nothing more?
What more is there than the universe, Spock?
Other dimensions.
Higher levels of being.
The existence of which cannot be proven logically.
Therefore, V'Ger is incapable of believing in them.
What V'Ger needs in order to evolve... is a human quality... our capacity to leap beyond logic.
Joining with its creator might accomplish that.
You mean this machine wants to physically join with a human?
Is that possible?
Let's find out.
Decker.
I'm gonna key the final sequence through the ground test computer.
You don't know what that'll do to you!
Yes, I do, Doctor.
Decker, don't.
Jim, I want this.
As much as you wanted the Enterprise, I want this.
Captain.
Spock, did we just see the beginning of a new life-form?
Yes, Captain.
We witnessed a birth.
Possibly a next step in our evolution.
I wonder.
Well, it's been a long time since I delivered a baby.
I hope we got this one off to a good start.
I hope so too.
I think we gave it the ability to create its own sense of purpose... out of our own human weaknesses... and the drive that compels us to overcome them.
And a lot of foolish human emotions.
Right, Mr. Spock?
Quite true, Doctor.
Unfortunately, it will have to deal with them as well.
Interrogative from Starfleet.
They're requesting damage and injury reports and complete vessel status.
Report two casualties.
Lieutenant Ilia.
Captain Decker.
- Aye, Sir.
- Correction.
They're not casualties.
They...
List them as missing.
Vessel status: fully operational.
Aye, Sir.
Mr. Scott, shall we give the Enterprise a proper shakedown?
I would say it's time for that, Sir, aye.
We can have you back on Vulcan in four days, Mr. Spock.
Unnecessary, Mr. Scott.
My task on Vulcan is completed.
Mr. Sulu, ahead warp 1 .
- Warp 1 , Sir.
- Heading, Sir?
Out there.
That away.
Heard your paper was running an honest race.
You heard right, Mr. Gebhardt.
Well, who in hell handicapped this owlhead as a favourite?
- The smart money.
- Thaùs what we come to get.
She's all finished, boy.
Yeah, she's all finished.
Must be the dude from London.
How's he going to win a 700-mile race, sitting on a postage stamp?
He won't win.
Wonderful journey, wonderful.
Miss Jones?
Reporter for the Western Press.
- You the one said I wouldn't show up?
- I'm pleased to be wrong.
In that case, pleased to meet you.
Don't you never touch me. Never.
Morning.
How much?
Civil War? South?
These days, medals from losers is worth nothing. No offence, mister.
$300's a bet.
Check.
$250? Call.
Two pair.
You drew to an inside straight?
Ridiculous.
- I think iùs rather sporting.
- I hope your horse doesn't run as lucky.
My horse is the luckiest horse in the West, but he never plays cards for money.
We've had more than sixty letters to the editor asking why is a woman in the race.
- Written by men?
- Mostly women.
They figure you must have a special reason.
Two thousand reasons.
How about you, Mr. Carbo?
Can your horse stand up against thoroughbreds?
My bronc only has to be half as good as them hotbloods...
...'cause I'm twice as good as these oldbloods.
I've never been committed to defeat quite so tactfully.
This race will be won by a horse.
Not a mouth.
Won by a bronco.
No thoroughbred has the speed, wind or bottom of a mustang.
Not for 700 miles, and that includes your Arabian.
$5,000. My horse against the field.
- Even money?
- How about you?
- I'll cover the rest.
There's plenty more, if you're game.
One game at a time, Mr. Parker.
Where is this great horse of his, anyway?
Coming aboard next stop.
- Good to have you with us. Mr. Parker.
- Thank you.
- Where the hell is my horse? Seen her?
- Was she here?
- She's supposed to be.
- Was I supposed to see her?
You can't miss her.
She's got "champion" written all over her.
I see. That explains everything.
I don't read.
Hold your damn horses!
We're running late.
You're not leaving without my horse.
- You know the rules, Mr. Parker.
- The hell with your rules.
Afternoon.
Can you spare some milk for a hungry orphan?
He don't know anything but his mom's teat.
You like horses?
You got one of your own?
You want one?
You got one, then.
- Don't I got to pay something?
- Yeah.
Don't ever treat him bad.
You're in the big time.
I'm in the shithouse.
- Out.
- For what?
- Hustling.
- Thaùs a crime? They're all hustlers.
They work for me. You don't.
That makes it a crime.
Ride him, cowboy! Ride him!
Whiskey for me, and beer for my horse.
Cowboy always tends to his horse first.
Telegraph Chicago.
You're covered, $15,000 at 7-to-5.
$12,000 in Kansas City, even money.
- Call off all bets.
- Can't be done, baby. Iùs play or pay.
- Get through to my son.
- On his way. He'll be here before dark.
- Your father left about an hour ago.
- What about Tripoli? He show yet?
- No, sir.
- He's stupid.
$40,000 bet on a missing horse, in the hands of a fool.
- Two important regulations. Rule One...
- Win!
Rule One: Each horse must carry no less than 160 pounds...
...including rider, saddle and extras.
Rule Two: You'll be issued a compass and a map for every leg of the race.
On it, you'll find the safest route.
You don't have to take it.
You do have to make every checkpoint.
Miss one, you're disqualified.
Out of the race.
Any questions?
Jump-off time: 6:00 in the morning.
Hey, British.
Drink to the winner!
Thank you. I haven't really won the race yet. However...
Damn fine shooting, sir.
- The best, right?
- Lf you say so.
What do you say, pop?
Never saw a man yet could hold his liquor like a bottle.
Hey, you. Whaùs your name, what do you say?
You're pretty good calling a poker hand.
You care to call this hand?
You going to pass?
Nobody wants to play.
Tex, fetch a jackass.
- Anybody killed?
- Just the quart.
You done right.
A boy looking for a reputation is the most dangerous thing alive.
It certainly wasn't worth dying for.
What is?
Even if you do it, whaùs it going to prove?
Proves I can do it. Thaùs what it proves.
That your jackass?
No.
Then it ain't your business!
Never heard of Sam Clayton?
Champion of dumb animals, ladies in distress, lost kids and lost causes.
- How you been?
- Fine, till you come along.
- You want it sudden?
- Drag it out.
Palm Sunday.
Matthew 5:44.
Just like old times.
You start trouble, and I start bleeding.
- Get up, damn it!
- Palm Sunday's over.
Hurts, don't it?
Something personal?
My eyes ain't as good as his.
I might miss. You'd be dead, and I'd be out of the race for abusing a dumb animal.
Bad for you, worse for me.
Okay, pop.
- You look like a man of property.
- When I shook you, my luck changed.
- Big things?
- New things.
- Easy living?
- Right.
- Who wants easy living?
- I do.
You. You're fired.
Your job was to get J.B.'s horse on the train. That was your job.
You gave all the others a 70-mile advantage.
He was handled real easy, Mr. Parker.
Perfect condition.
Then she'll win.
If she could have won before today, she'll still win.
- Except for one thing: Me.
- And me.
Me, too.
- You'll need moving money.
- Who said I'm moving?
Staying takes even more money.
I got a month's pay coming.
A hot bath costs $5.
I guess I just won't bathe.
It takes $15 just to get drunk.
I'm going to stay sober.
$30 for an all-night woman.
Seventy miles in six hours?
Could he go 100 miles every day for a week?
That might be enough to win this race.
I came 5,000 miles to try it.
- Why?
- To beat the best.
You must be either rich or crazy.
A little of both, I'm afraid.
I came 3,000 miles for the Kentucky Derby.
Another 2,000 to see Joe Gans box Battling Nelson.
Forty-two fantastic rounds.
It was bloody marvellous.
- You know who won?
- I'm not interested.
Not interested in who won?
Thaùs not only unbelievable...
...iùs positively un-American.
What does interest you?
Right now? Just a job.
What did Parker pay you?
$50 a month? $60?
You win this race, and you'll get three years' pay.
Whaùs the horse get out of it? Colic?
Cracked bones?
You ever see a horse run himself dead just to please the man on his back? What for?
- Get his picture in the paper? For glory?
- Some men live for it.
Horse don't give a damn who wins a race.
Me, neither.
In the interest of the Wesùs greatest horse, the bronco...
...and myself, who grows them,
I'm putting up an extra $1,000...
...to the bronco rider who wins!
Matthews.
I'd like a chance to win back some of my daÔs money.
I figured you would.
- How do you like the joint?
- It ain't Kansas City.
Would you believe so many chumps in the middle of Nowhere, U.S. A?
Like shooting fish in a barrel.
- Nice, fat sucker fish.
- All you need is the right bait, Rosie.
It takes more than a deck of cards and a pair of knockers.
Horse race pulled them in.
This crowd, their hustle's the fast buck.
- Whaùs yours?
- The same.
And if you don't win, which you won't...
...I'll lend you the $2,000.
You can work it off in Kansas City.
Bang bang, you're in the chips.
At $20 a bang, out of which you get half, thaùs one hell of a lot of banging.
Iùs a hell of a lot easier on your ass than 700 miles in a saddle.
The money's for Steve.
He won't care how you got it.
- How many times you been married?
- Eleven. Ten without a preacher or license.
- Well, did you love any of them?
- All of them. Every one of them.
The good and the bad.
Iùs a shame to waste all that prime beef on a guy serving three to five in prison.
You two keep in touch?
- He's kind of a lousy letter writer.
- Lousy bank robber, too.
You have anything for a toothache?
Latest thing in miracles: Heroin.
One of these painkillers, and a chaser of whiskey:
Four hours of joyhouse!
Have you tried this heroin yourself?
Mister, I tried everything except confession.
Even God wouldn't believe it!
I've forgotten how good a bad woman feels.
Flattery and money will get you anything!
Two of the best, for two of the best.
Truly a wonderment.
Whiskey.
- You drink with greasers?
- Only seÚoritas.
My grandpa was Mexican.
I bathed that old man every day till he died.
Iùs a funny thing, though.
I never did find a greasy spot on him.
- Pure Mex ain't bad.
- Breed. You can smell it.
Well, that must be why I can't smell it.
- I'm half Cherokee.
- I'm a squaw man, myself.
Anybody pays, gets drinks.
Anybody don't like it, throw them out!
Mr. Matthews?
Business.
I'll miss your company.
Ninth, and final entry:
Clayton, riding a coldblood.
Attention. For all contestants, everything is on the house...
...except booze, betting and bawds.
What else is there?
We've got a problem.
We both can't win.
No. Thaùs not the problem.
- The problem is, I can't afford to lose.
- Who won the Gans-Nelson fight?
Gans, on a foul, in the 42nd round.
The greatest fighter I ever saw in my life, black or white.
Won me $300, which I ran into $2,000.
Most of it old Parker's money.
- Anyway...
- you know, I'm un-American?
Whaùs that?
I don't know exactly.
Except, if you're not the best...
...or the first and the greatest, if you don't win...
...then you're not American.
- Which brings us to the problem.
- I didn't know Joe Gans was a black man.
I just bet everything on this race.
I got 7-to-1.
You bet $2,000?
- On yourself?
- Who else?
Well, thaùs not so serious.
All you got to do is beat
J.B. Parker's champion horse...
...and J.B. Parker's champion rider, and J.B. Parker's champion disposition.
No. That ain't all.
My bet says no other rider in the race will beat mine.
Thaùs in writing and thaùs a problem.
Miss.
You got nothing to worry about.
You admit that you can out-drink...
...out-fight, out-shoot, out-jump...
...out-luck, out-ride any man born of woman, don't you?
Except you.
I never said I could out-ride you.
- Do we eat now, or after?
- Just so iùs not during.
Class. For a natural-born loser, you certainly got lots of class.
You just be at that finish line, with that $16,000.
He expects to win.
You saying this race is fixed?
All I know is, no matter what the game, cards, craps, racing, boxing, whatever...
If you can bet on it, it can be fixed.
Can be.
And thaùs all I know.
Well, all I know is I'm winning this race, so don't crowd me.
- How do you like it, mister?
- Without conversation.
Don't forget my bed. Get all the tables.
Don't forget the booze. Strip the joint!
Get a horse!
Maybe. Maybe thaùll save a couple miles.
Is he all right?
Splendid.
Boy, what did I do to you?
It was damn stupid of me, wasn't it?
A little over eight hours.
They ought to be strung out...
...from here to about here.
How far we come?
Halfway, I think.
- Halfway?
- To the first checkpoint.
The father of your father.
He was truly a Mejicano?
But you are simp·tico.
I had a toothache once.
I've had it. Good luck.
So long. Good luck.
What happened to the miracle painkiller?
He took six pills in one hour, instead of one every four hours.
Killed the pain all right, but he almost died.
I made him throw up the pills.
Now his toothache is back.
Can you get a dentist on that thing?
If he could, and if the dentist comes, by the time he gets here, we'll be gone.
The nearest town's 100 miles in any direction.
- He wants it pulled.
- Who by?
- By us.
- He's crazy.
- He's got a lot of faith.
- That proves he's crazy.
Checking out.
- Christie just rode out.
- So did I.
Hold this, will you?
Tooth's chipped.
That nerve is open.
Cover the tooth, and the pulling can wait.
- What about the poison?
- That goes first.
Do I cut it from the inside, or from the outside?
I'll do it.
What calibre's that tooth?
The bullet size.
Use the casing to cover the tooth.
- Smaller.
- Smaller. Okay.
Checking out.
Crank out a round for me, will you?
After you doctor him up...
...suppose he goes out and wins?
Then, what do you say?
I'd have to say, "you're out $2,000."
Checking out.
You're losing time.
Right. You won't think it unsporting?
Hell, racing for money ain't sport. Iùs war.
This linimenùs going to burn for a week.
Put a little right there.
Careful of my vitals.
- Seems you're not worried about this race.
- Yeah, seems like it.
You know, missing that train like you did yesterday...
...thaùs not like your kind of man.
You must have had a good reason.
I must have had.
Well, I don't give a damn about the reason.
I was out of hand.
I just wanted you to know that.
- Whaùs on your mind, Mr. Parker?
- I want you to come back on our team.
You get a bonus and a raise. Deal?
You just take the rest of the week off.
With pay.
How about it?
I'll look you up after the race, Mr. Parker.
Bite.
Thanks.
- Get any sleep?
- Not much.
- They gone long?
- Three, four hours.
We'll catch them before dark.
Drop it!
Drop it.
Hogtie her.
Turn around.
Morning, neighbour.
- You fixing to stay?
- No, just passing through.
Then you ain't my neighbour.
- Been here long?
- Ever since I come.
This trail here. Where does it go?
Ain't going nowhere that I know of.
Always been there.
Well, how far is it to town?
Don't know. Never measured it.
Well, you don't seem to know much.
I said, "you don't seem to know much."
I don't know a damn thing about nothing.
But I ain't the one who's lost.
Much obliged.
Jesus!
He is generous today.
One of us better know the way.
Hold him, damn it!
Muzzle that stump-sucking bastard.
I ought to bust your ass wide-open!
Lousy whore.
- Don't.
- Shut up, damn it!
You ain't nothing but a lousy crib-alley whore.
Get back that rope.
Don't say it.
Don't say it.
Don't! What he said don't bother me.
Now, quit!
Nothing to do with you.
I know you can pull this over here.
How in the hell do I pull you over there?
Good evening.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.
Miss Jones.
And how was the shorter road?
Longer.
I'll go have a look.
Watch the sport.
Miss Jones, going to need a blanket.
He's crazy! He's got to be crazy.
- Is that so?
- He tried to kill me.
Well, he couldn't have tried very hard.
Son of a bitch tried to kill me!
Why don't you tell me the story of your life.
Just skip everything but the last few minutes.
What the hell you doing down here?
By God, I'm shivering.
- Is it busted?
- Whaùs busted is my pump.
- How do you know?
- Army doc. Couple of years back.
He said, "When that pain hits your arm, thaùs the alarm bell.
"When it hits your pump right after, thaùs it."
Can you make it to the checkpoint?
No.
Come on, iùs only a couple of hours.
Easy ride.
Leùs try.
You certainly have a knack of provoking a man to violence.
- All I said was that she was...
- It was the way you said it.
Like an insult.
- When a woman does it for money...
- A man gets the best of the bargain.
Before you take her to bed, she's a thing of beauty.
In bed, an angel of mercy.
- Afterwards, she's a...
- Whore.
- A pillow of peace.
- A whore!
Thaùs what Clay married in the war.
Cuba, '98.
She's the only woman Clay ever loved.
How about you?
I was never that lucky.
Let go. I don't want them to know.
I ain't run out of my string yet.
- Evening. Thank you.
- Old man, I thought sure you'd cashed it in.
- Not till I'm back in Oklahoma.
- I'd rather be in hell than Oklahoma.
Every man to his own country.
Thanks.
Why didn't you take the barge across?
Against your religion?
You know Injun ponies. Said if he couldn't go on a canoe, he'd rather swim.
- Well, I saved you some supper.
- Thaùs good.
I want it served by one of them nice ladies wearing nothing but a big smile.
Done!
Why?
Why, in damn it, would a sick old man like you get tangled up in all this?
Why, in the name of sweet Jesus?
What is so important about this gut-twisting, back-busting...
...man-killing goddamn race?
- The money?
- The prize.
- The prize is the money.
- The prize is winning.
Lose, you're nothing.
Who remembers a loser, or even cares?
Win, you're somebody.
What you done, iùs printed.
Iùs in a newspaper.
And when iùs printed, it ain't brag.
Iùs real.
Suddenly, everybody knows you, or wants to.
Strangers shaking your hand.
"Pleased to know you.
"Have a drink, have a cigar.
Meet the wife."
Everybody's friendly and welcome.
I got a lifetime hunger for being welcome.
No family?
Him.
You know saddle tramps. They sign on...
...drive the beef 1,000 miles, make your mark...
...draw your pay, and move on to the next ranch.
Another round up. Another drive.
Hired, fired, and move on.
Never bothered me none.
No. Me neither, when I was 30 years lighter.
Ever prospected?
Ever hit pay dirt?
I've dug for gold, silver, lead, mercury.
I've dug more holes than a whole regiment of gophers.
I never dug out a decent day's wage yet.
God, what ain't I tried.
Pony Express rider, overland stage driver...
...lawman, gambler, river man, rancher...
...rodeo hand, barman...
...spittoon man. Old man.
Nothing much to remember.
Of course, there ain't nothing much to forget, either.
Nobody's got much use for an old man.
I can't blame them much.
Thaùs why I'm going to win me this here newspaper race.
When I cross that finish line,
I get to be a big man.
Top man.
A man to remember.
I didn't even know your name, mister.
A couple of miles out from here,
47 miles of desert. Nothing but sand.
An ocean of it. By night, cold.
Hostile, but easier going.
By day, a blazing hellhole.
Halfway across, water stop.
The only one.
Miss that water, you're in trouble.
If you're lucky, eight hours in the devil's own frying pan.
Railroad. We'll wait here till noon.
Can you beat the desert before sunup?
Well, how does it shape up?
Tight.
You're not worried? Who by?
An old man, a girl, a punk kid.
Where's the class?
Kids and old men don't respect class.
And don't sell the girl short.
- Lf she ever cut that brute of hers loose...
- Why would she hold back?
Probably too green to know better, but the Mexican's not. And he's tough.
- Anytime we can't beat a Mexican...
- Horseshit.
- And that stubborn Englishman...
- He'll never keep up the lick.
Tell that to him! I lose him, I look around, he's biting my ass.
- Sand dunes will finish him.
- The tougher it gets, the better he likes it.
The same goes for Matthews.
What he hasn't got in horse, he makes up for in brass.
Cuts every corner, takes a lot of chances, and he's lucky.
That cowboy you fired...
- So far, he's showed nothing.
- So far, maybe he ain't tried.
His bronc's a real stayer. Tough hide.
He's got the heart.
Cowboy's got the know-how.
He's the sleeper. The one to beat.
- We'll beat him.
- Yeah.
News. We're big news everywhere.
"Chicago. Adding $250 to purse and will headline winner in my Wild West Show.
"Signed, 'Buffalo' Bill Cody."
- Wasn't he the fastest gun in the West?
- Only in bed, kiddo.
"London. To Sir Harry Norfolk," our Englishman:
"Up the British. Signed, Prince of Wales."
Invitations to the winner from
Rome, Paris, Moscow. All expenses paid.
And, get this.
From the President of the United States:
"To all the intrepid contestants.
Bully for you!
"To the two Rough Riders, Clayton and
Matthews, who served with me in Cuba...
"...remember San Juan Hill.
Charge, boys, charge!"
Look him over. Fast!
- What happened to the old man?
- He's dead.
Get moving. I'm going out.
- This horse is running a temperature.
- Iùs nothing that will bother him.
I'll be fine.
Son of a bitch.
I'm going to catch me that champion.
Yes, sir. I'm going to catch him before this day is done.
Salt.
Could I ask you something? Your wife...
...where is she?
I was wondering how you met.
I work for Rosie. Off and on, about a year.
I guess that don't surprise you none.
The only thing that surprises me is the people some people marry.
Because she was a whore?
A Cuban.
Paula was a Cuban insurrecto.
Guerrillas, fighting the Spanish, just like we was.
Thaùs where we met. On the battlefield.
That was our wedding bed till that day.
We came out of the jungle, and there it was, San Juan Hill.
Spanish guns looking right down our throat and sharpshooters picking us off.
We just charged right up that hill.
Thaùs not the way it happened at all.
It wasn't anything like it was in San Antonio, where we did our training.
Thaùs where I ran into Luke...
...and a lot of other men from every other country...
...that wanted to be Rough Riders.
Bakers and barbers.
Congressmen and cattlemen.
Ballplayers, farmers, reporters, cowboys.
No, we didn't rough ride up that hill...
...'cause we didn't have any horses.
We didn't charge up there, either.
We crawled up there on our scared bellies.
There was only one horse and one rider.
That was Colonel Teddy.
He went charging up that damn hill.
They shot his glasses off.
He put on another pair.
They nicked him in the elbow.
And he said, "Follow me!"
And we did,
'cause we were too damn ashamed not to.
After the Hill, came the church.
There was a French 75 out front.
Every window had a rifle sticking out of it.
There was a Gatling gun in the bell tower.
We could have called the artillery boys in to blow it to pieces...
...but outside, along the walls...
...they'd tied all these people up.
Roped them together, hogtied them.
Looked like a bunch of sandbags.
Women and children, nuns and prisoners.
My Paula among them.
Neither me nor Luke nor anybody else knew what to do.
Inside the church, they knew what to do.
They opened up on us and we fell back.
All of a sudden, I heard Paula scream out:
"Asalto, Cubanos, asalto!"
Then, a Spanish bullet.
The rest of the women took up the cry.
"Attack, Cubans, attack! Attack!"
Her own band of guerrillas led the way.
The people some people marry.
I wasn't worth her spit.
Bury him.
- What with?
- Your goddamn hands.
See he does it.
You see to it.
What he said. Is it that important?
It must be. He said it twice.
It was Gans in the 42nd round!
Anyway, he's walking in from a couple of miles back.
Didn't want me to carry the extra weight.
He said it wasn't sporting.
- Hey, kid!
- Yes, sir.
- I'm going to lay a chore on you.
- Yes, sir.
Take the old-timer's horse there.
We got a problem with those prisoners.
They're all maximum-security.
Our plan still holds.
Look for this mark on the left front hoof.
No horse passes through without this mark.
List of riders.
To you, this race is worth about $2,000.
To me, iùs worth $14,000.
Now, say iùs you and me in front...
...coming down the stretch.
Got the picture?
You hold back. Make it look good, of course. I win.
I collect my bet, turn the prize money over to you. Nobody gets hurt...
...except old Parker, who's out $14,000, which is only justice.
Yeah, you're right.
- I could never do that to my best friend.
- Only friend.
- So we split 50-50. Deal?
- No deal.
- You want more than me?
- What I want is...
Name it.
What I'm going to do is win this race.
That is the greediest, most selfish thing that...
Do you realise you're betraying a friend?
If it ain't by a friend, it ain't betrayal.
Thank you.
Got it.
Not hungry?
Miss?
Sorry about all those things I said.
All this hardware.
I ain't never been in a gunfight.
Killing a man don't prove you're a man.
I ain't never been a cowboy, either, like I said.
I know.
I've been around a lot of cowhands, one way or another.
Cowboy dresses from the top down.
First thing on is his hat.
And he undresses from his boots up.
Last thing off, hat.
Another thing. To be a cowpuncher.
That don't mean you got to go around punching them.
Yes, ma'am.
Laudanum.
Supposed to make you sexy-sleepy.
Well, I've got no such problems.
I got to get me some sleep. I can't sleep.
Guilty conscience.
Why? 'Cause I won't throw the race?
Nothing so hard on a man as virtue.
How could you know?
According to the Gospel of Old Luke Matthews.
"Virtue is its own punishment."
You might say this is our Last Supper.
Beyond that next mountain, iùs all downhill to the finish line.
And you, Mr. Norfolk.
Will you be with us at the finish?
I wouldn't miss it.
To the West!
Awesome, but inspiring.
What the hell's inspiring about a flash flood or a blizzard?
Or a landslide or sandstorm or dust storm?
Any sudden disaster, personal or financial?
Today, the desert broiled you raw.
Tomorrow, the mountain'll freeze you stiff.
Thaùs your West. Violent, treacherous.
Where every prairie dog hole is a goldmine.
Every molehill is a mountain. Every creek is a river, and everybody you meet is a liar.
"When you call me that, smile, stranger."
The Virginian, Owen Wister. Another liar.
For a family who don't know a jackass from a mule, you know about the West.
We don't have to know about it.
We own it.
Bastard! You poisoned him!
- Wait, Miss Rosie.
- Who paid you?
- Him?
- Nobody.
- Bitch! Where'd you get this?
- A couple of days ago.
For me! For when I can't sleep.
Neither could he. Ask him!
No, she's right!
Iùs just supposed to make you sleepy.
Thaùs all.
Mix it with booze...
...you get one hell of a Mickey Finn.
See you.
Bet your ass!
- Your name?
- Jones.
Stretch! Face down.
Steve.
Kate. The rifle!
What about those two, Steve?
Just where the hell do they fit in?
I need them. They're coming with us.
How?
- You're not taking this horse.
- His and two more. Thaùs the plan.
The plan was us! Nobody else!
You and me, out of here on my horse.
Will you for Chrisùs sake shut up?
Dirty business.
You never think, maybe, to win this damn race?
They hurt you?
I have seen many bullets.
Too many.
But this one...
Truly, did you ever know...
...a bullet that is good for the health?
The key!
How do you start it? How do you make it go and how do you stop it?
Take your hand off the clutch!
- I'd like to go with them.
- This horse stays here.
That makes it a one-horse race.
Thaùs not the kind of race I wanted to win.
Set a reasonable time for them to get back with their horses.
If they get back.
If he gets into those woods...
Hey, kid! The horse!
Miss Jones.
The people some people marry.
Who is it?
What'd you have to kill him for?
Shut up.
Now that the school year's coming to a close, many of you will be going forth to prove how cleverly you can run the world.
More power to you as you take your turn in the barrel.
Some of you will continue with your education.
Some of you, I hope, will continue with your interest in art.
Some of you will have other interests, other talents.
If we've learned nothing else this year,
I hope you've learned the stupidity of the statement that art belongs to the world.
'Cause art belongs to the cultured who can appreciate it.
The majority of the great unwashed does not fit into this category.
And neither, I'm sorry to say, do most of you.
Dr. Hemlock.
I just wanted to tell you how much
I really enjoyed your course.
I've never felt this close to art before.
How nice.
But I have a problem.
How terrible.
Well, you see, if I don't keep my B average, I'm gonna lose my scholarship, and I really don't think I'm gonna do so well in your final exam.
I mean, I've gained a whole new feeling about art, but sometimes you can't always put your true feelings down on paper.
How true.
If there was anything I could do to get a better grade...
I mean, I'd be willing to do anything.
Anything at all. Really.
Do you realize the implications of that offer?
Are you busy this evening?
No.
You live alone?
Oh, well, my roommate's gone for the week.
Good.
Then, go on home, break out the books and study your little ass off.
That's the best way to maintain a B average.
Oh, uh... Don't study it all off.
Why didn't you boff the little quiff?
'Cause I don't pick on students or drunks.
Get your feet off my desk.
Mr. Dragon wants to see you.
I'm sorry, Pope, but working for you people no longer amuses me.
C-2 isn't too interested in what amuses you, pal.
That's odd, being as your organization has spent so much time and effort in trying to give the rest of the world a laugh.
You can remind Dragon that I'm retired.
You still here?
Now really, you don't expect me to just walk out that door, do you, sweetheart?
Either through the door or through the window. It's your choice.
Now look, pal...
Get your feet off my desk!
Now look here, buddy...
Don't call me "buddy,"
"pal," or "sweetheart."
If I wasn't under orders,
I would...
My superior wants to see you.
Your superior? Well, that doesn't narrow the field much, does it?
Mr. Dragon wants to see you, and right away, pal.
I told you not to call me "pal."
Mr. Dragon's not gonna like this.
How long have you worked for Dragon, Pope?
Twelve years. Why?
Then he's used to having grief in his life.
You can tell him I'm retired. C-2's gonna have to live without me.
Don't forget your trench coat.
How's anybody gonna recognize you without your disguise?
Yes, Dragon.
Ah, Hemlock!
I knew you'd show up.
It's just your charm, Pope.
I couldn't resist.
Hold it.
Empty your pockets, right there.
No wallet?
Well, I knew I'd be seeing you. I thought I'd best leave it home.
Miss Cerberus, you're looking inviting today.
I expected you before this.
Mr. Dragon does not like to be kept waiting.
Oh, the impatient albino!
I don't think
Mr. Dragon's affliction is a joking matter.
I thought it was rather humorous, myself.
A spy network being run by a bloodless freak who can't stand light or cold.
Or germs! Are you healthy?
Shall I turn my head and cough?
No known infections?
Nothing other than the usual.
Syphilis, running sores, and clap.
All right, go in.
Come in, Hemlock.
A little to the left, Hemlock.
I'll turn on a light.
Thanks. Could you spare it?
You know, I'm something of a distinction.
A total albino.
Even the slightest direct light causes me intense pain.
Does your physical disability preclude you from coming to the point?
All right. If you wish no small talk, sit down.
We'll discuss business.
One of our agents has been killed in Zurich by two men.
We want you to sanction them.
I'm sorry, you're gonna have to get somebody else to do your wet work.
Please, that is a distasteful phrase.
Call it what you want,
"wet work," "termination,"
"sanction."
It all adds up to the same thing, killing.
It is what you do best.
You don't seem to remember, Dragon,
I'm a retired assassin.
The operative word there is "retired."
You'll have to get somebody else to do your sanctions.
I understand a new Pissarro has come onto the black market.
I'll just have to live without it.
Your fascination with paintings has always amazed me.
You have how many now?
- Twenty-one.
- Marvelous!
I should think your collection would be interesting material for the Internal Revenue people.
How does an underpaid professor buy rare paintings?
Masterpieces worth millions?
A professor with a balance of $2,137 in his checking account?
You forgot the 42 cents.
I wonder what the tax people would say if I told them how I made the money, by killing people for the government.
True. True. But, of course, no one will believe you.
And even more important, it won't do anything for your paintings.
What do you think would happen to them?
I imagine they'd be seized and auctioned off, made available to everyone.
Perhaps Mr. Pope would be able to buy one.
Won't it do your heart good to think of one of your precious paintings in Mr. Pope's hands?
Dragon, you have a talent for describing the indescribable.
There are two assailants.
Our search division has located only one of these men in Zurich.
C-2 is working on the second one, and I would hope that they will have identified him by the time you arrive in Zurich.
We have reason to believe that the Zurich man is responsible for the assassination of several of our agents in a most savage manner.
I'll take one sanction. Only one.
All right.
We shall talk about the second sanction when the time comes.
The price'll be $20,000.
Twice your usual fee? Absurd!
You want the sanction performed, you pay $20,000.
You are without conscience.
How true.
Which brings me to another small fee
I want to get for this job.
Which is?
I'd like a statement from the Internal Revenue Service listing my collection of paintings.
I'd like it to say that the IRS has examined my collection, and that the IRS is fully aware of the circumstances under which I obtained them, and that my ownership is legal and without tax liability.
You drive a hard bargain.
You want somebody sanctioned.
I want a piece of paper.
All right.
You'll have the IRS statement this evening.
Here is the cash.
I hate being predictable.
You are never that, Hemlock.
Who is there?
A delivery.
I have this box of dental floss for Dr. Millard, but he doesn't answer his door.
He's off today.
What'll I do with this box of floss?
I don't give a shit what you do with it, buddy.
Well, you don't have to be violent about it.
Get lost, cupcake.
Look out!
Crap?
I beg your pardon?
You did start this conversation by saying "crap," didn't you?
No, I didn't say it. I asked it.
Is this today's alternative to, "Coffee, tea, or milk?"
Only on our competitor's lines.
Actually, I was looking over your shoulder and I saw your comment, so I asked.
Just some criticism of this book I'm reviewing.
All and all, it's a very shabby piece of research obscured by involuted style.
Shabby research I can stand, but involuted style really makes my ass drag.
I can't believe that you're a stewardess.
Actually, I'm not.
I'm a skyjacker in drag.
That's reassuring.
Now if you'll just give me your name,
I'll report it to the proper authorities when we land.
Jemima.
And I'm Uncle Ben.
I'm serious. That's really my name.
Jemima Brown. My mother was hooked on being ethnic.
Or else turned on by a pancake.
As long as we both agree that it's too much for a black chick to have the name of Jemima.
Oh, I don't know. I mean, people don't forget you when your name is Jemima.
I don't think people would forget you if your name was Alfred.
Goodness me, Dr. Hemlock.
You're not the type of man who tries to pick up stewardesses, are you?
Not generally.
How'd you know my name?
It's this mystical thing
I have with names.
It's a gift from the Dark Continent.
I look at a person very carefully, and then I concentrate.
And?
And then, I go check his name out on the passengers list.
And what else do they call you besides Jemima and Smart Ass?
Jem, as in jewel.
Fasten your seat belt, sir.
Oh, I have no intention of trying to escape.
Aren't you gonna get in, or do you like it out there?
I looked for you on the plane.
No harm done.
I was on my way to town and you looked so lonely,
I took pity on you.
Well, that's an ancient trick.
Whenever I'm waiting for a cab,
I look lonely and maybe some unbelievable beauty named Jemima will pick me up.
Gonna have to be a double fare, you know?
Fine.
You know, buddy, we ain't supposed to pick up two fares in one location.
Hey. Let's agree on a division of labor right now. You do the driving.
We'll do the talking.
All right.
How can you look so good when you're starving to death?
Am I starving to death?
Mmm, you broil a mean steak, Hemlock.
Come on, I'll show you my lime pit.
It's kind of scary looking.
Maybe I should drop pieces of bread so I can find my way out.
Jonathan!
They're unbelievable.
Not bad, huh?
One of the better collections in the neighborhood.
You have El Greco down there,
Matisse,
Picasso,
Clay, Matisse.
Over here we have Pissarro.
It's astonishing! I mean, there's so much life in them.
Yeah, I'm picking up another one of his tomorrow.
I've heard about guys like you reading those books.
Whips and boots and things.
But an ax? That's a little freaky.
Call me a cab.
I'm getting outta here.
Just some old climbing equipment.
You climb?
I used to, but I'm retired now.
Maybe you'll climb again someday.
I doubt it.
However, you never know.
Sometimes people do things they thought they'd never do again.
Like rape, for instance.
Yeah. I thought I'd given up rape, but I think I've changed my mind.
You really have beautiful eyes.
Or do they all say that?
All?
Who all?
Yeah.
Good morning, baby.
There's coffee by your bed.
The hell with coffee.
Where are you?
Jonathan, it's important that you contact Mr. Dragon as soon as possible.
I'm sorry to drop it on you like that, Jonathan.
Baby, I'm sorry.
Sorry for this, Hemlock.
But twice a year, my blood must be fully replaced.
With what?
You're very bitter today, Dr. Hemlock.
A joke. Bitter Hemlock.
Listen, Dragon. I came here for two reasons.
One, to tell you that using that Jemima Brown to steal my money was low, even for you.
And second, to get my money and tax statement back.
It will be returned to you.
- And the tax statement?
- That, too.
Well, then we have nothing more to discuss, do we?
There is still the sanction on the second man who killed Agent Wormwood.
I will give you another $20,000 for this second sanction.
Forget it. I'm back in retirement.
You are the only man who can do it.
You could train Pope. He'd be ready, in about 40 years.
Would you leave Agent
Wormwood unrevenged?
Well, those are the breaks.
Did you know who Agent
Wormwood was, Dr. Hemlock?
Wormwood was Henri Baq.
Henri Baq?
Yes.
I thought he was retired and living in Paris.
He approached C-2 and asked for work.
Apparently, he had financial difficulties.
We tried to be helpful.
Unfortunately, it turned out tragically.
Why wasn't I told about this before?
We had reasons.
They did not concern you.
We preferred that you took the sanction for your usual reasons, greed and avarice.
- Henri Baq was my friend.
- Yes.
He saved my life once.
Yes.
Then why am I the only one who can perform this sanction?
First, do you accept the assignment?
Yes, I accept.
What we have is this.
The target is male.
He is an accomplished mountain climber.
We learned this from a note we intercepted.
Also, a witness said he limped.
Well, that's fine.
Now all I have to do is kill every mountain climber with a sore foot.
Not quite.
Our man will be involved in a climb in the Alps this summer.
You're getting warm now, Dragon.
That narrows it down to three or four thousand men.
Fewer than that.
We know which mountain he will climb.
And?
The Eiger.
North face, of course.
That is correct.
You are familiar with it?
You know I am.
I tried to climb it twice.
It tried to kill me twice.
Look, if the target's trying to climb the north face of the Eiger, chances are my work could be done for me.
I cannot trust to chance, Dr. Hemlock.
Now, the only climb planned for the Eiger is a goodwill climb with a team from Germany, Austria,
France and the United States.
Now, the target is one of the other climbers, the Frenchman, the German or the Austrian.
We are continuing to work to try to identify him.
Undoubtedly, we will have his name before it is necessary for you to climb the Eiger.
You're passing over one small matter, and that is payment.
Naturally, considering the rigors of the assignment, we intend to be generous.
You will receive $30,000.
I'm sure that's more than you expected.
More than I expected, but less than I'll receive.
Oh?
Yeah. I'll receive $100,000, plus expenses, of course.
You recognize that this is outrageous?
Well, I'm viewing this as retirement pay.
This is definitely my last assignment.
You are punishing us for using
Jemima Brown? Is that it?
You need me to perform the sanction, just pay the money.
You drive a hard bargain, Hemlock, but to show you there are no hard feelings,
I'm going to give you a bonus.
Oh, pardon me while I choke.
You will appreciate this.
The bonus is Miles Mellough.
Miles? What does he have to do with all this?
It appears that after the microfilm was stolen from Worm...
Henri Baq, Miles Mellough was the courier who carried it to the enemy.
Since he was not one of the killers, a sanction, technically, is not called for.
However, you may have it if you wish.
I accept the bonus.
I thought you might.
I imagine this will be the last time that you will be here.
I shall miss you, Hemlock.
You know, Dragon, you could have saved yourself a lot of trouble if you'd have told me to begin with that the dead agent in
Zurich was Henri Baq.
Good luck, Hemlock, on your latest assignment, the Eiger Sanction.
Wild Turkey on the rocks, hmm?
It's right downstairs.
I guess I shouldn't have dropped it on you like that, Jonathan.
Just how should you have dropped it on me, Jemima?
I just couldn't let it go...
I mean, I couldn't let us go on without you knowing that I work for Mr. Dragon.
And I didn't have enough guts to tell you face-to-face.
Boy, I must've been really dazzled not to notice all those coincidences.
You on the same plane, just happening by with the taxi cab, discovering the note from Dragon.
How was it supposed to work?
Were you supposed to deny me your body if I don't accept this sanction?
Don't make it sound so cheap, Jonathan.
Just too shabby to even be called cheap.
For your information,
I was not assigned to seduce you.
How long have you worked for Dragon?
Only a month.
But I've been a C-2 courier for five years.
Jonathan, do you understand how important this sanction is?
I mean, the film that was stolen from Wormwood...
His name was Henri Baq.
Well, the stolen microfilm involves a new formula for germ warfare.
And I'm supposed to get it back by killing people?
Let me tell you something I'm sure you're not aware of, Aunt Jemima.
You know what purpose these sanctions serve? Absolutely none at all.
They're just retaliation. They kill one of ours, we kill the killers.
No purpose at all, just barbaric.
You're getting religion a little late.
I didn't quit because of religion.
I quit because of mathematics.
Oh?
That's right.
The odds are stacking up against me.
Assassins who stay too long wind up assassinated, and that ain't in my game plan.
But...
Look, I don't pretend to know what Mr. Dragon's thinking, but there's a formula for germ warfare out there and the other side has it.
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.
It's dangerous, child, to come to conclusions when you don't have any facts.
Now, let me lay some on you.
Sure, Dragon knows what he's doing, just like he knew what he was doing when he worked for the
Nazis during World War II.
- What?
- Oh, you didn't know that, did you?
Yes, your wrap 'em up in red, white, and blue Mr. Dragon's a goddamn Hessian, that's what he is.
And he'd sell out the other side as fast as he'd sell out our side.
He'd sell out his mother, too, if the bloodless freak had one!
You think it's so awful the other side has a germ formula?
It's against the
Geneva Convention, isn't it?
And they stole it from us.
Well, what the hell are we doing with it in the first place?
We're not supposed to have one either.
And you don't see any difference between their side and our side?
Yeah, I see a difference. As long as we have Dragons and Popes working for us, how bad can the other side be?
Where's my change?
This is Henri Baq.
I had a bullet in me once, and he carried me for three days.
I owe him one. He was a friend.
Who's that man?
That's Miles Mellough.
He's the guy who tipped off the people who put the bullet in me.
An enemy.
And him?
That's Ben Bowman. He and I used to climb a lot together.
I'm going out to his climbing school and get in shape.
Friends, enemies.
Where do I fit in?
I'm sorry, but you don't.
Here's to the selfish killer and the patriotic whore.
Do you have anything else to say to me?
I usually keep a twenty in the bowl there, by the kitchen door.
You might pick it up on your way out.
Goddamn my eyes!
How the hell are you?
Goddamn, you're looking good.
A little soft maybe, but, goddamn, I'm glad to see you.
How the hell have you been? Boy, are we gonna drink a lot of beer!
Wait till you see the goddamn place. How the hell are you?
Jesus Christ, Jon, don't you ever say anything?
Well, I'm waiting for your mouth to get tired.
Just down the road a piece, old buddy.
About 20 miles, as I remember.
Uh-huh.
Nice leisurely five-minute ride.
Only when I'm in a hurry.
No need to hurry, Ben.
That's why I'm taking it nice and easy.
You ain't gonna recognize the old place.
Hope I live to see it.
That city life has spoiled you, made you kind of soft.
You ain't a pansy yet, are you?
Let's just stop this death trap and I'll show you.
What's so funny?
I was just thinking of the last time we climbed.
You had to haul my ass down off that mountain.
That's liable to turn out to be one of my bigger mistakes.
Still do any climbing, Ben?
No. Nothing a pissant couldn't hop over.
I ain't a climber, anyway.
I'm an impresario.
- Huh?
- An impresario.
At least, that's what they call me. That ain't dirty, is it?
Could be.
When did this all happen?
Oh, about two years.
What do you think of it?
- Well...
- I know. It's so frigging ugly, it makes me sick.
But it keeps me in moccasins.
I've been taken over by the swinging singles!
What happened to the climbing school?
Ha!
My guests are more interested in hunting than they are in climbing.
Thought the whole point of climbing was hunting.
Damned if you ain't right, Jon.
Damned if you ain't right.
Well, this is really interesting, Ben.
Uh-huh, yeah.
Begins to look like I'll make it through the winter, huh?
Two brews.
Not bad.
Thanks. Not bad at all.
I think I like the old place better though. More character.
Character and unpaid bills, old buddy.
Goddamn, I'm glad to see you!
Dealing with these phony bastards really makes my ass weary.
That's the perils of being an impresario.
You sure that ain't a dirty word?
Shut up and drink your beer.
On, God. My, my!
All right. Beat it, Buns.
At least I know you're not here for the hunting.
Psst! Psst!
But your wire made it sound like more than just a visit to an old buddy.
It is, Ben. I want you to get me in shape for a climb.
Much of a climb?
Eiger, north face.
You're kidding?
Nope, I'm part of an international team.
I know about that international climb.
Lawrence Scott heads the U.S. team.
He had an accident.
How old are you, Jon? Thirty-five?
- Give or take.
- Uh-huh.
I know what you're thinking,
Ben, but I have to go.
You've been to the Eiger before.
- Twice.
- And you know what it's like.
Ben, I'm going, God damn it.
All right. All right. I did what a good friend's supposed to do.
I tried to talk you out of it, right?
Now I'm gonna tell you the truth.
Horseshit! I'm going with you!
You, going to the Eiger?
I'm the ground man for that climb.
Ain't that enough to singe your ass!
I'm gonna nursemaid you again after all of these years.
You nursemaid me?
I not only could out-climb you on your best day,
I can out-drink you right now.
Well, you just enjoy that one,
'cause you're off the sauce until you're in shape for the climb.
Meanwhile, I'll have another.
Well, this is where I turn back.
- Thank God.
- Not you. You need the work.
George there will take you on up.
She's a girl.
A lot of people notice that.
All right, George. Give him a workout, then bring him back for a meal.
I'll see you, old buddy.
You don't have to do everything he says.
After all, this is a chance to strike back at the white man.
Hi. I'd like some
French Onion Soup, crabmeat cocktail, broiled lobster tails, and Wild Turkey on the rocks, please.
Very good, sir.
Well, that was quick.
Well, what do you think of George?
Very warm, humane person.
Gives great conversation, too.
But she's a climbing fool, ain't she?
Boy, that she is.
Wore me down, but
I'll do better tomorrow.
Tomorrow? Today, me bucko.
You go back out again right after lunch.
You'd be well-advised to have a good reason for making this call.
Rise and shine, old buddy.
Oh. Go piss up a rope.
Just scalp me.
God damn it! I wish
Custer would have won.
Time to rise and shine...
Screw Marlon Brando.
Dirty, rotten...
Dirty, evil, scheming, devious bitch.
Leave Dr. Hemlock alone, Faggot.
Forgive him, Jonathan, but I'm afraid Faggot has not learned to recognize you straights.
Miles.
My, my, aren't we looking splendid, Jonathan?
How long has it been?
Indochina, you and me and Henri Baq.
And I haven't made a verbal blunder.
Actually, it's about Henri that I wish to chat.
Miles, the only thing you and I have to chat about is you having an incurable disease and lack the guts to kill yourself.
Very good, Jonathan. Very good.
You've grown a great deal.
But wrong!
Should we be sensible and have a drink?
Waiter!
We'd like to order some drinks, please.
A Wild Turkey on the rocks for my good friend, the doctor.
And I would like...
I would like a frozen daiquiri.
Well... Miss?
Oh, Miss. May I know your name, please?
Buns.
Yes, of course it is.
Miss Buns, I wonder if you'd be a gentleperson and take my roomie for a stroll?
Sure, anything.
I'm sure. Off you go.
His name is Faggot.
That's cute.
Be careful he doesn't rape you. Charming.
Ah, here we are.
Well, you're a very handsome young man.
I would say he's made, wouldn't you, Jonathan?
I assume you're covered.
Uh-huh. Your assumption is correct.
At the bar.
That's your cover?
Uh-huh. Dewayne is very strong.
He was a world's champion.
Weren't they all?
Must seem odd to you that I've looked you up after all these years.
But you see, Jonathan, I'm...
I've grown very tired of waiting for you to step up behind me one day and relieve me of existing.
Stepping up behind is your method, Miles.
I wanna look right into your face.
Yes, I'm sure you would.
However, that does not enhance my cool.
It'll all be over soon.
Funnily enough, I find myself in a very strong bargaining position.
Forget it.
Not even curious?
You betrayed the both of us in Asia and we lived, no thanks to you.
Now you people have killed Henri in Zurich.
I didn't actually kill him, you know.
Well, I probably won't actually kill you.
That's very little comfort.
Henri was a worthless alcoholic, and I abhor sloppy drunks.
I'll allow you that.
It's the price I must pay to get you to listen.
I did not, I repeat, I did not participate in that killing.
Because unlike you,
I am not an animal.
But I do know who did the killing.
You got one, and now you're after the other.
Dragon has promised you the identity of this person.
Maybe. Maybe not.
The point, I know who this person is.
And until you get that information, you're in great, great danger.
How?
Suppose I were to tell this person who and what you are?
He would hunt you.
You'd sell this man out for me?
For what I want in this life,
I would even sell my dear mother.
How true.
What I need from you is your promise to leave me alone.
What do you say?
All right. I'll give you my answer in a minute.
Whichever way it goes, we were friends once.
As you can see, Miles and I have made up.
Can I buy you a drink?
Get him whatever he's having.
I'm sure glad, too.
I'd hate to tangle with a guy your size.
Just want you to know.
Now I'm gonna tell you something.
And listen, 'cause I'm gonna ask questions later.
I don't like you on my flank 'cause it scares me.
I don't like being scared.
If you ever come near me again, I'm gonna kill you.
Understand? Understand?
Yes.
Good boy.
Hope you told your cook we'd be back for lunch.
You're full of piss and vinegar today.
You promise to have mercy on an old man like me?
You wanna lead? You've been up this before.
No, I'll just tag along.
This the right way?
It's one way, I guess.
You're a big help.
I wanna know why you busted that guy's head at the pool.
Rock.
All right, it's none of my fucking business.
You know what?
Way down deep, you got the makings of a real bad ass.
I don't know that I'd like to be alone on a desert island with you if there was a shortage of food.
Don't worry. You're a friend.
You ever had any enemies?
A few.
Any of them still around?
The guy by the pool.
Miles Mellough. What do you know about him?
He checked in today.
He looks like he could change a nine dollar bill in threes.
Want me to throw him out?
No, I want him right here.
What about the other guy?
The big guy? You want him, too?
Him, too.
You set him up kind of neat for an elderly college professor.
You got me in shape.
It's not that.
You set him up like you were used to setting people up.
You're climbing fine, Jon.
Better than I've ever seen you.
Well, I wish I was on the Eiger right now, I'll tell you.
Why go at all, Jon? Isn't this enough of a climb?
No way.
I've gotta make it.
Hey, have you ever met any of these guys we're climbing with?
Yeah, about a month ago.
And?
They're a good enough bunch.
They've got a lot of hills behind them.
Any of 'em walk with a limp?
Now, who in the hell could climb with a limp? Now, wait a minute.
The German was limping. Said he hurt himself in a fall.
Freytag, he's a funny guy.
Makes noise like a leader.
Family makes bug spray.
Got a lot of money, but he doesn't like to talk about it.
Anyway, he's got the look.
What look?
The look of a guy you couldn't count on in a clutch.
I wouldn't want to count on him on that hill.
- What about the Frenchman, Montaigne?
- Oh, Montaigne's all right.
I think he's a little too old for the Eiger. He's about your age.
- Screw off, will you?
- I'd rather screw Montaigne's wife.
She's a real brick shit-house.
Wait'll you catch her act.
She's a regular mantrap.
I feel sorry for the poor bastard, trying to keep his eyes on her.
Yeah? And what about the Austrian?
Oh, you're gonna love him, Jon.
Meyer doesn't give a rat's ass about anything except climbing.
All the people I talk to say he's the kind of climber like...
Well, like you used to be.
You mean, before I got decrepit and weak?
You didn't look so decrepit and weak yesterday, punching out that wrestler.
Anyway, this Meyer's really something. He killed a guy once.
Oh?
Yeah. A porter on a climb they were making was stealing some food.
He killed him with a knife.
Isn't that something?
Sounds like a real charmer.
Listen, Jon, if you got to rope yourself to anybody on that hill, you make damn sure it's Meyer.
This is a big man. You're the only one who's climbed it.
Uh-huh.
How'd you do it?
Guts, skill, determination, all that sort of stuff.
Hey, why don't we just call it a climb the way it is and take the escalator down?
Okay, give me some slack.
You gonna stand up there all day admiring yourself?
Or are you gonna bring me up?
All right.
Congratulations, old buddy.
You got her cherry.
What do you mean?
You're the first one ever to climb up here.
Well, you climbed it yourself, you told me.
You ain't gonna get very far in life listening to a liar like me.
You were hoping
I'd quit, weren't you?
Hoping I'd give up on the Eiger climb.
Let me tell you something, Ben.
There's a damn good chance I might not have to make the climb.
I may be able to conclude my business before the climb starts.
No.
Once you get over there, you're gonna want to climb. That's the way you are.
Want a beer?
You gonna call room service?
We got beer.
If you hauled beer up this rock, you're insane.
I may be insane, but I'm not stupid.
I didn't carry it, you did.
It's in your pack.
Jesus Christ! I ought to throw you off this pillar.
Besides, it's warm.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'd thought you'd draw the line at hauling ice.
Oh.
Well, good evening, George.
"Good evening, Dr. Hemlock."
And how are you this fine evening?
"Oh, I'm just fine, Doctor."
Did you watch that magnificent climb Ben and I made today?
"Yes, I did, Dr. Hemlock.
"It sure was good."
You know, George, I'm gonna be leaving here soon, and I'm gonna kind of miss you, in my way.
"I'll miss you, too, Doctor."
Um, one thing I'll have to say, George, is you've never cluttered up our relationship with any sticky sentiment.
Maybe we should just cut the chitchat and you just jump in here and we'll get lucky.
Ow!
Desk! Desk!
No.
All right, now, take it easy.
Take it easy, old buddy.
Ow.
Doc says you're gonna be all right, but you just got to take it slow.
Where is she?
I got her down in my room.
My men are watching her.
Want me to call the sheriff?
No, not yet.
- What happened to me.
- Miles Mellough. I knew you'd be wondering.
He's still here. The desk'll call me if he makes a move.
So it was Miles.
That's what she said.
Why'd she do it?
Oldest reason in the world.
Love?
Money.
What the hell did she shoot into me, anyway?
The doc says it was a relative of morphine, but not enough to be fatal.
You know, morphine sounds right.
Miles is in the drug business.
Why the hell didn't he polish you off?
He told her it was gonna be nothing serious.
He just wanted to scare you.
After George put me under, my guess is,
Miles was gonna come in and off me in some spectacular fashion.
Probably give me an O.D.
That sounds like his style.
What are you gonna do about him?
Something massive.
Something massive!
Good morning, Dewayne.
Well, good morning, Jonathan.
My, aren't we looking chipper today?
Sleep well?
Very well, thank you.
You know, Miles, I think I'll forget about you for the time being.
Difficult task. Just like that?
Well, you see, I'm gonna be training here for a few more weeks, and I'm gonna need all my concentration without having you in mind.
Well, I do sympathize with you.
Truly, I do, Jonathan.
But if this means you're going to cross me off your list for good...
I might just do that.
I'll tell you something. Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
Only if I can choose the wine.
Look forward to it.
Bastard!
He hit his brakes.
No, he didn't.
He turned the switch on his headlights.
Oh, Jonathan, what a cheap, dirty trick.
After him, Dewayne. After him!
We've got him now. Look!
We've got him trapped. He can't turn around on this road.
Where the hell is he?
Dewayne, there he is!
Oh, Jonathan, you are an animal.
Look at that dear gentleman.
You tried to kill me.
Get in the car.
Uh-uh.
Get in the car.
Get out.
What the hell are we gonna do out here?
Get out.
Jonathan, you're not going to shoot...
Jonathan, you're not going leave me out here!
Jon...
Oh, Jonathan, for Christ's sakes, kill me, but don't leave me here!
You can't...
Pretty quiet now, aren't you, you little prick?
Jonathan!
Goddamn my ass, what the hell do you mean, you ain't got any rooms for me?
My dear Herr Bowman...
My dear Herr's ass.
You just stick your nose in that book and you come up with my reservation.
Hiya, buddy. You're looking good.
What's the problem here?
Oh, this rinky-dink has screwed up my reservation. Says he can't find my telegram.
From the looks of him, he couldn't find his tallywhacker with a six-man search party.
I did not know this person was a friend of yours, Dr. Hemlock.
Yeah, well, he's in charge of the climb.
In charge of the climb? Oh, yes.
Just one minute, please.
All the Eiger birds are coming in.
Maybe you should have given him a tip.
Yeah. Did you meet the other climbers yet?
They're supposed to be here in the hotel. How's George?
She's fine.
Listen, about Miles...
Look, later on that.
Everything is in order.
You will be with the other members of the party on the 2nd floor.
Room 216. I'll have your luggage taken up.
Yeah, and have them send up a case of beer.
You know, after you left, all hell broke loose.
Government agents all over the place, asking questions, making assholes of themselves.
They find anything?
Yeah, you know that big guy you creamed in the bar?
Found him blown in half with a shotgun.
Miles, they found on the sand, dead as Kelsey's nuts.
What the hell are you here for?
I don't want you to concern yourself with that, Ben.
I'm just here doing something for an old friend.
Let's call off the climb. Tell them you're sick or something.
You know I want another shot at this hill.
Herr Bowman?
Yeah?
Karl Freytag wants us in the sitting room immediately.
Stragglers will be shot.
Only the lucky ones.
Ah, lady, gentlemen.
Jonathan Hemlock,
Jean-Paul Montaigne.
- Jean-Paul.
- I've looked forward to meeting you, Mr. Hemlock.
My pleasure.
This is my wife, Anna.
Anna.
Hello. Care for a drink?
And this is Karl Freytag.
- Karl.
- Herr Doctor.
And this is Andrei Meyer, Jon.
- Hello.
- Andrei, I've read a lot about you.
I used to read a lot about you.
It appears that we've read a lot about each other.
It's snowing out there.
How are the weather reports?
Oh, not too good. We've got a couple of good days, and then we've got a bunch of weak fronts moving in.
It's gonna be pretty dicey after that.
Good, that settles it.
Settles what?
We must leave immediately.
Do we have time to finish our drinks?
I mean, as soon as possible.
With a storm coming in, in maybe four days?
Well, the Eiger has been climbed in two.
But supposing you don't make it in two?
Supposing you get pinned down up there by the weather?
Oh, Benjamin has a point there.
We must not take childish risks.
We can't climb without some risks.
Perhaps the young face these risks more easily.
Good weather, bad weather. Now or later, any time's good for climbing.
All right, an impasse.
Two in favor of climbing, two opposed.
The democratic process.
What do you suggest, Doctor? Professor
Hemlock, that we climb halfway up?
Ben has a vote.
Yeah, but he will not be climbing with us.
He's our ground man. Until we hit the wall, he has complete control.
Has that been decided?
It's always like that.
The ground man has the last word now and the leader once we're on the face.
Okay, that brings us to another issue. Who's to be the leader?
I thought that was settled.
I thought you were gonna lead.
Okay. That decision was made before the original American member of the team had his unfortunate accident.
You know, I think we should make sure we agree on who's to lead, especially now that you've joined us.
You make a good point. Jonathan has climbed the mountain twice before.
Correction, if I may. The good doctor has failed to climb the mountain twice before.
I don't want to offend you, Herr
Doctor, but I'm forced to say
I don't consider a record of failure automatically grants you the right to lead.
I'm not offended.
I think it's important that you lead.
Okay. Good, then, let's come over here.
Let's move over here.
I've spent months studying a new route up the Eiger.
Taking the face by a new route will put us in the record books.
What is this new route?
Okay, we won't take the Hinterstoisser
Traverse. Instead, we go this way.
Our first bivouac should be high above the difficult cracks.
That's about here.
And the next morning, we have to move up this vertical rock face.
That'll be pretty tough, I guess.
We go all the way up and come out next to the highest visible ice field.
That's here. And then it's up to the top.
But nobody's ever been on that part of the face.
We don't know what's there.
Supposing you can't cling to the edges?
Suppose you get forced down into the gut of the chute?
Well, I've no interest in suicide, Ben.
If the edges are not a go, we'll retreat and follow one of the more classic routes.
Where all that can stop us is the weather.
Just one thing.
You know, your route doesn't allow for retreat in case we're blocked from above.
Well, I consider it self-defeating to plan in terms of retreat.
I consider it stupid not to.
Okay, I'll leave the planning for a retreat route to Dr. Hemlock.
After all, he has more experience than I in retreating.
Okay, may I take it my plan is accepted?
Fine.
Our business is settled.
Now, I suggest we relax and have a drink.
Is this hotel always so crowded?
Only when there's a climb.
Then the Eiger birds start flocking in.
Eiger birds?
Yeah, jet-setters.
Assorted zombies who come here to watch a climb.
If they get lucky, they get to watch a man die on the mountain.
That's grim.
So is the Eiger.
It even looks grim.
Do you have to go up?
Unless the search division identities the assassin first.
They've come up empty.
Is that what you came here to tell me? As a courier?
I could have phoned.
I just wanted to come up and be with you.
Oh, Jonathan, I had this fantastic speech planned.
I mean, I was going to say it really quick before you interrupted me or walked away.
Well, how's it go?
I forgot.
Well, first, why don't you tell me why you set me up?
I did it because I believe you had to take this sanction.
All right, I've taken it.
And you and me, working side by side, like loyal Americans, not to mention Dragon and Pope, will save the republic yet.
Have you met the other climbers?
Mmm-hmm.
Any suspicions?
Could be any one of them.
Could even be Madam Montaigne.
She's a very destructive woman.
You know the type.
I'm cold.
Jonathan, you know what I don't have?
No. What don't you have?
I don't have a room for the night.
Jesus.
I see, so you're a condemned man's last wish, huh?
4:00 p.m. We leave in 12 hours.
We must do the first thousand feet before the sun loosens the ice chunks.
If the weather holds.
It will hold.
It's certainly magnificent.
A perfect choice for my last mountain.
Hey, Jon, sit down, have a beer.
I've got a friend checking in, but I guess I can always go for a beer.
What's this about your last mountain?
Well, I'm not longer young, Jonathan.
Think of it. At 42, maybe I shall be the oldest man to climb the Eiger.
What do you think about that, Madam?
How do you feel about climbing?
I consider mountain climbing the biggest nonsense.
I've never been in better shape.
Ask Anna. Every night for 6 months,
I perform two hours of exercise before bed.
By now, she must be very anxious to see you climb the mountain.
Doctor, a message from the gentleman outside.
I think I'll take a stroll. Madam
Montaigne, would you care to join me?
Well, I think I shall return to my room.
If you will excuse me?
Well.
Well.
What got into Jean-Paul?
I don't know.
A little jumpy, I guess.
You been jumping his wife?
- No. Why?
- You sure?
Well, I think it's something
I'd know. I'll see you later.
Hey, Hemlock, how's it going?
Nice place here.
Get on with it, Pope.
Okay, pal, if that's the game you want to play, we'll get right down to the nitty-gritty.
No one is more qualified than you are.
Search division has drawn a blank on the target.
All we know is, he's here somewhere.
Miles Mellough knew who it was.
He did?
Did he tell you?
He offered to, but the price was too high.
What'd he want then?
To live.
Oh. Well, I just came to tell you that we've drawn a blank, and you'll have to climb.
Jemima Brown told me that already.
Jemima did, huh? Well, I just want to make sure you got the message.
You know how these Schwarzes are. You can't really trust 'em.
Pope, I really don't mind you being an asshole.
You can't really help that. But I do mind you lying to me like I was a fool.
Now you came here with one thought in mind, and that was attach yourself to me so the target would know who I am and what I am.
Now who's gonna perform this sanction if he gets me, you?
You don't think I can handle it?
In a locked closet with a grenade.
Just a minute, buddy.
Doesn't bother you a bit that you've blown my cover, does it?
Not one frigging bit, pal.
And if I walk?
No way.
You wouldn't get your hundred grand.
You'd lose your paintings.
And you'd probably spend some time for smuggling them into the country.
How does it feel being in a box, sweetheart?
You've done real well, Pope.
Well, that's mighty white of you.
Hey, that's a joke.
I bet Jemima never says that to you. "Mighty white of you."
By the way, how's that black stuff?
Pretty good, huh?
I guess it's only fair to warn you in advance
I'm gonna have to waste you a little.
Well, about your gun,
I got one waiting for you.
It's at the hotel. It's a C-2 special with no serial numbers.
It's in the candy box.
Now what's this about wasting me?
It's only fair to warn you, Hemlock, that I'm a black belt in karate.
Pope.
Gee, I... Gee, I...
Oh, my hand!
Okay.
You'll be all right now, Pope.
Course, you may have trouble playing the clarinet for a little while.
Listen, sweetheart, baby, pal,
I'm going back in the hotel, and when I come out,
I don't expect to see you around anymore. Understand?
Sleep well.
Good night. See you tomorrow.
Offer me a nightcap?
Some other time, thanks.
I wish you luck tomorrow.
Thank you.
I wish Jean-Paul would change his mind.
I can't understand why he's insisting on climbing this mountain at his age.
I can. He does it for you.
What? For me?
That's right.
He tries to keep you from younger men by staying young himself.
By doing young men's things.
Poor thing.
Yeah. Particularly since it hasn't worked.
It's colder than a witch's tit.
Good climbing weather, Ben.
Now you listen to me, old buddy.
You come down off that hill in one piece or I'm gonna kick your ass!
You're not gonna get sloppy on me, are you?
Now, look, you haven't told me anything, but somehow I know that you and one of them foreigners is gonna have some trouble.
Maybe.
Just guard your flank. Don't take your eyes off of 'em.
- I won't.
- Come on, let's be off!
We must make our first move before the sun unfreezes the rubble.
Take care.
Well, they're on their way.
That frigging Hemlock.
Thinks he's so goddamn cute.
How do you think he'd feel if he knew this whole thing was a fake?
A fake?
Sure.
Hemlock's friend? That Wormwood?
He was supposed to get killed.
That's why we hired the drunken bum.
But what about the germ formula?
I mean, the other side got it.
That's the real cute part.
They were supposed to get it.
It's a phony.
So why the sanctions?
Well, that's simple.
To sell the other side that the formula's the real thing.
Now, if we just let 'em steal it and not do anything about it, well, they'd get suspicious.
So, we had to assign Hemlock to sanction the assassins.
Do you mean to tell me that you're sitting up here safe, and that Jonathan might be killed?
And for nothing?
Honey, don't get worried. There's still lots of men around here.
Present company excluded.
Jonathan told me that you people were no better than animals, and I should've listened to him.
Don't be late coming up.
We're in the clear, Herr Doctor.
So far so good.
I knew it would be.
Take it.
You want to untie that?
Karl really likes to lead, doesn't he?
Uh-huh.
Even more, he likes the title of leader.
As if that makes him a leader.
Tell me, Andrei, you ever spend much time around Zurich?
There are no mountains there worth climbing.
They can see us pretty well from the hotel today. It's nice and clear.
I suppose so. We must give them a good show, Jonathan.
Chocolate?
Thanks.
Jean-Paul doesn't look well.
Something is on his mind.
Maybe.
Resting already, Herr Doctor?
Come on, let's get moving.
You don't like me,
Herr Doctor, do you?
I don't dislike you.
I just think you're stupid.
You knew we were going on this climb and still you got involved with Montaigne's wife.
She told you?
She didn't have to tell me.
The climb's gonna be hard enough without any intrigue.
All right.
What the hell are you doing?
I couldn't sleep.
I'm checking the ropes.
There was a frayed end on your rope, and I'm cutting it out.
Looks like we have some wet work ahead of us, huh, Freytag?
Surely, Herr Doctor, you have no objection to a morning shower.
This would be a hell of lot easier in the wintertime.
You suggest we wait?
Way to move your jaws, Jon.
That thing's gotta be a bitch.
That's gotta be a bitch.
I say, old boy, are you using your scope?
Do you mind if my wife has a peek?
Darling, tell him you'll pay for it.
We can pay for it, you know.
Get out of here. Either of you frigging vampires ever touch this telescope, you're gonna need surgery to get it out of your ass.
Damn rude fellow.
Bloody American farmers, you know.
- Rocks!
- Huh?
Jesus!
Freytag! Meyer!
Jesus Christ!
Goddamn!
Oh, God.
You all right?
I'm all right. I'm all right.
Oh, thank God.
Thanks. Where's Freytag?
He felt he wasn't needed.
Thought he wasn't needed?
Freytag, you asshole!
Tell me, Mr. Bowman, in your opinion, do these men climb to prove their manhood or is it more a matter of compensating for inferiority feelings?
Lady, why don't you go get yourself screwed?
It'll do you a lot of good.
Well, the worst is behind us.
You really needn't be so glum, Herr Doctor.
If we have to retreat, we're never gonna make it back through those falls.
You have a defeatist mentality. We won't retreat. We'll go straight on up.
You didn't know we were in trouble?
No.
That's not good.
Oh, it sounds exciting.
Pity I slept through it.
That's the spirit.
Come on, up we go.
Shit!
- What is it?
- It's a foehn moving in.
What's a foehn?
Warm air, then rain, then a freeze, like all in a flash.
Is that bad?
It's frigging awful. That entire mother of a rock is gonna be covered with ice.
But you can't walk on it, and you can't see through it to find a crack in the rocks to drive your pitons.
The snow is all glazed over.
But you'll be able to drop through up to your neck at any time.
Worse thing, it's coming from the south.
They won't even know it's coming until it hits.
Then they must come down.
Lady, by the time they find out, they won't be able to come down.
They won't be able to go up.
They're just gonna be stuck.
You all right?
Yes, let's rest.
Morning.
How's Jean-Paul?
He's dead.
He must have gone during the storm.
Drink that.
How do you know he's dead?
I looked at him.
You saw he was dead, and then you made a pot of tea?
Drink it before it gets cold.
He had a concussion.
The storm was too much.
The man inside couldn't keep the man outside from dying.
What now?
Moving ahead is out of the question.
Conditions are impossible.
We're gonna have to go back.
Through the ravine?
No, the ravine's impossible, too.
- Andrei, you listening?
- Yeah.
Speak up if you disagree.
You're doing fine.
All right.
We traverse back across the ice field to a place approximately above the rail road tunnel window.
There, if we can get a rope down,
Ben will be waiting with help.
I'll lead. Karl, you be second.
Meyer, you bring up the rear.
We'll string Jean-Paul's body on a separate line between us.
We gonna carry Montaigne back down?
A climber always brings home his dead.
We'll get down.
- Mr. Bowman?
- Just go away.
Oh, you're Jon's friend, aren't you?
Yeah. How is he?
Uh, well, they're coming down.
Shit, I don't know. Montaigne is hurt or he's dead.
Do you think they can get down safely?
There's only one chance.
Everything is iced.
If they can get to those cliffs above the station window, maybe they can rope down and we can pull them in.
How much of a chance do you think they have?
Not much, but it's the only one.
As soon as I find out that that's what they're doing,
I'll bring men up to the station.
You know, I didn't want him to make this climb.
And now, Montaigne is either hurt or he's dead. I knew there'd be death.
It was planned that way.
All for nothing.
Drop your packs. We'll rig some safety lines up.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah, but think of what it must be like up there for them.
Come on, Jon.
Get your ass off that hill.
Jonathan!
Damn it! Belay me.
Hang on.
Jonathan, watch it!
Hang on. We should be over the tunnel window.
In the future, I wish you would not use me to ride around on like a sled.
Look, you better get up there before he panics. Those pins are loose.
Jonathan, you're very good.
I have really enjoyed climbing with you.
We'll make it.
I don't think so.
But we shall continue with style.
Take it easy.
Take it easy. Don't panic.
Wait.
Look out!
I can't hold him!
The ice is cracking!
Jon!
You're limping, Ben.
I'm gonna throw you a rope.
You're limping, Ben.
Listen to me.
I'm gonna throw you a rope, Jon.
Catch this rope when
I throw it to you.
Wrap it around you.
Wrap the rope around you.
Hook the rope to you!
Good!
Now cut the rope above you.
Jon, do what I tell you.
Cut the rope above you.
Cut the rope above you, Jon.
Cold mountain air really bothers the old frostbite.
You ought to remember, Jon.
You hauled me down off that mountain when my feet froze.
I'm the one you're after.
I never planned for
Henri Baq to die.
I was supposed to take him out and buy him some drinks and con him out of the microfilm.
I was as surprised as anybody when Kruger killed him.
How'd you get involved with the other side anyway?
Miles Mellough. I owed him.
He helped get my daughter off drugs.
Daughter?
George is my little girl.
Took a chance coming up on the mountain.
You took a chance when you cut that rope.
Old pink eyes is back.
Jesus.
Yeah?
Hemlock, we don't know and we don't want to know how you managed to precipitate all three fellow climbers from the mountain.
We assume that, unable to discover your target, you decided to take all three.
Extravagant, but effective.
And you have always been both.
We regret that your file will be placed in the inactive list.
However, we hope that one day you may work with our organization again.
Good-b ye, Dr. Hemlock.
Thank you, baby.
Well, C-2 thinks they've got their man.
There's no reason to persuade them otherwise.
You wouldn't shit me, would you, Jon?
Hate to spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder for you, like Miles did.
Forget it, Ben.
Look...
Yeah.
Well, maybe someday we'll do some more climbing together.
Maybe.
You know what I don't have, baby?
What don't you have?
I don't have a ticket back home.
I'll take care of it.
That art collection of mine is not going to get any bigger, but I'd sure like to have you take a long look at it.
I thought you'd never ask.
I'll get two tickets.
Jonathan, you can tell me.
You didn't really sanction all three of them, did you?
What the hell you trying to do, kill yourself?
- There's something down there.
- What was it?
I don't know.
Something grabbed my arm, twisted me around.
Almost pulled my arm off.
Here. Give me this.
Listen, I told you, you gotta stay with me.
David, I panicked.
Well, listen, you can't panic.
You just gotta learn to relax...
...and control yourself.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Actually, David, it's my foot.
Damn thing bit off my entire foot.
Look, it's just a bloody stump.
I almost drowned.
We might as well be married for all the concern I get around here.
You wanna go dive naked?
In the bathtub, in the hotel?
Gail, hey, look.
- Look at this.
- What is it?
I don't know.
Looks like a coin.
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay, babe.
Goliath? I thought you said you were diving on the Brighton.
We did dive the Brighton...
...then we spotted that wreck off the point...
...so we decided we'd take a look.
It wasn't in the guidebook.
Damn right it's not.
Goliath's full of munitions.
Tourists aren't allowed to blow themselves up, you know.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Can't believe the stuff this Romer Treece...
...has found off the coast around here.
I can believe it.
- What have we found out?
- Well, I don't know.
"O.P.N." means ora pro nobis,
"pray for us"...
...and "S.C."
I can't find in any of these.
You know, if I'd wanted to spend my holiday in the library...
...I could've walked 10 blocks to 42nd Street.
- Let's approach this methodically.
- I'd love to play tennis.
- Our coin is dated 1714, right?
- You're not listening.
The only ships that went down in that period...
...were King Philip's fleet in 1715.
- Ping-Pong?
Now, that's fantastic because there's 30 million in gold.
Okay.
I'm gonna play tennis with a pro.
No.
All right.
- What are you gonna have?
- Wine, madam?
No, thank you.
- Would you care for some more, sir?
- Thank you.
- Would you like some dessert?
- No, thank you.
It was about here, outside the wreck, that I almost had my arm torn off.
All right, if you were there...
...I was across the hull in about 80 feet of water...
...and that's where I found that coin...
Hello.
You must be the young couple who found that bottle this afternoon?
Smallish, three inches long, tapered?
It could be Reinhardt glass, you know...
...from Rotterdam, before the war.
- It certainly didn't look like anything...
- We didn't find any bottle.
Yeah.
We...
My name is Henri Bondurant, a jeweller by trade.
By avocation, a collector of rare and unusual glass.
You see, the government here...
...has rather strict rules about diving.
Legally, you cannot take anything off Bermuda...
...unless you first offer to sell it to the government and are declined.
Unfortunately, the government rarely ever does decline...
...and even more rarely offers premium prices.
- What'd you say your name was?
- Bondurant. Bondurant.
Well, I am sorry. This is fascinating, but what does it have to do with us?
Let me tell you something.
If that bottle is a genuine Reinhardt...
...it would be a small coup for a collector like myself.
- I would be prepared to offer...
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I told you, we don't have any bottle.
In that case...
...my apologies for having interrupted your conversation.
Good night.
Jesus. Who was that?
Some dynamite businessman.
You could have listened.
Well... Come on, Gail.
Bottle collector, my ass.
Do you think this is it?
Well, it isn't a bloody tourist trap.
What do you want?
- Mr. Treece?
- Indeed.
Well, Mr. Treece, a friend of ours...
...was doing some diving around here about a month ago...
...and found a Spanish coin that was dated 1714...
...and he told us to talk to you.
- Look it up in the Hamilton library.
- Yeah, we did.
We talked to the librarian and she said for us to come here...
...and talk to you because you'd help us.
Yes, well, she's a stupid woman...
...but she's kind, you know.
Quite kind.
She still growing her moustache?
It's all right. Come on in.
Let's see what you got.
Come on over, then.
But you haven't been asked for lunch.
Thank you.
Well, it ain't no coin, boy.
It's a Spanish medallion.
It's a medallion?
Beginner's luck.
If this hadn't laid against iron, it would've oxidized long ago...
...and you'd have nothing.
- Right.
We couldn't figure out the inscription, ora pro nobis, and S.C. In front of it.
"Santa Clara, pray for us."
That was common enough an inscription in those days.
- There you are, boy.
- Is it valuable?
One medallion? No, not to me.
Must be one of
King Philip's treasure.
That's the only fleet that went down in that time.
No, not unless it walked itself across the ocean for 800 miles.
That fleet went down in a hurricane off Florida...
...all 11 of them, 1715.
That's all documented and proven in my library.
We've already found El Capitano,
Ubilla's flagship.
Obviously, there's something down here, isn't there?
Well, now, just hang on a minute, boy.
You just found one trinket.
Might pay for your holiday, if you don't drink too much.
On the other hand, it might have fallen overboard...
...dropped there by some drunken old rummy one night.
What else have you got in there, then?
Hey, boy, this is Goliath trash.
What the hell were you doing diving down there?
We spotted the wreck off the point so we dived down.
Where'd you get this, exactly?
Right about here, just outside the wreck.
Are you quite sure?
Water plays strange tricks sometimes, you know.
Makes things look bigger, smaller, wrong way around.
- Sure it was right there?
- I'm positive.
There certainly are a lot of glass freaks in Bermuda.
Somebody else know about this, then?
Last night, a bald guy came up at dinner.
He said he was a glass collector.
He described that perfectly.
I didn't show it to him.
Looked like a basketball player.
Henri Bondurant, a French guy.
No, he's Haitian.
And, boy, could I just have another little look at that medallion there?
Yeah.
I think I might just've missed something here.
Come over here and let's have a look at this magnifying glass.
Yeah.
- Now, you see those letters here?
- Yes.
Not your normal mint mark.
That might be the mark of the engraver...
...or it might be the person who had it made up.
I'm sure of one thing.
It's made up for somebody special.
Then it might be worth another look down there?
Yes. Well, as I said, it might, but not to me.
Thank you.
Sorry you can't stay for lunch.
Wait a minute, Mr. Treece.
That's all?
- Come on, David. Let's go.
- Just a sec.
You might not mind wasting any more of your time...
...but I can't have you wasting mine.
You said there was something special.
- Let's go take a look.
- Good afternoon.
You okay?
Gail.
Go right.
I wonder what the hell this guy's doing.
David!
Try and pull over.
I can't!
David!
- David?
- Yeah?
Should have sold me that bottle.
Now you force me to take what you would not let me pay for.
Well, if it'll ease your mind,
I'll still name a price.
Take off their blindfolds.
Look, if it's not in the bag,
I don't know where in the hell it is.
- The girl.
- Look, she hasn't got it...
If his tongue moves again, cut it.
I'll do it.
Put it back on.
Since neither of you seem to have that bottle...
...I must assume it is now the property of Romer Treece.
Well, then, for Christ's sake, let him go.
It hasn't been all that pleasant for you, has it, Mr. Sanders?
Enjoy yourselves this evening.
Eat a good dinner...
...go dancing.
But be off the island by tomorrow.
Treece.
Come on, Treece.
All right, Treece.
What the hell's going on?
Take it up.
Listen, I'll look after this.
Okay.
- Hold it.
- Coffin?
He's the only man alive who might know one of these ampoules on sight.
Can I show him your map, please?
He was the sole survivor of the Goliath, you see.
Thank you.
Now, then, Adam...
...this one of your legendary ampoules?
This is the real thing, all right.
The old girl's finally lost her virginity.
My friends found it there.
Well, the way she's lying here a storm must've flipped her around.
She was never this close to the edge of the reef before.
You're lucky.
Five people have died over the last 30 years...
...trying to crawl inside that ship.
Blew themselves up poking torches around.
There's enough live ammo down there to blow up half the island.
Oh, will somebody just cut the crap?
Blew themselves up for what?
Goliath was a military ship, boy.
Went down with munitions and medical supplies.
Or so they say.
They're there, all right.
All right, what's there?
Morphine, 98,000 ampoules.
I packed them myself.
Jesus.
Why didn't you tell us the truth?
If you had, we wouldn't have had that run-in with that Haitian.
The name's Cloche.
That you didn't know nothing's what saved you.
I wasn't sure myself until now.
The first time he's told me the truth.
Adam, what do you reckon to the rest of them, then?
They're probably all smashed up by the ordnance now.
The way she's lying here...
...this time there won't be any steel plate to have to burn through.
They've performed a bloody autopsy on that with everything but forceps...
...but nobody ever found one of those before.
Well, we found one.
Oh, we are having a wonderful day, aren't we, David?
How come nobody found one until now?
Well, the sea's a joker, boy.
Loves to fool you.
Dive a wreck one day, find nothing.
That night, blows up a storm...
...go back again, same spot, you find a carpet of golden coin.
We just had one of the worst storms in 10 years, haven't we, Adam?
- Aye.
- Coffin!
Goddamn it. Coffin.
"Coffin. Goddamn it, Coffin."
Nice to meet you folks.
Mr. Treece?
Which one of us turns this thing over to the government?
Well, now, miss...
...I'm going to have to think on that.
You see, I was never one much to bother with formalities.
Morphine's not exactly a formality.
- That's halfway to heroin.
- Halfway to hell.
I know all about that.
So does Cloche.
By the time some Hamilton bureaucrat gets off of his fat bum...
...it will be heroin.
That's why I'm gonna dive down there tonight.
You haven't answered my question,
Mr. Treece.
I'll answer the question. I'm turning this over to the government.
I'm all the government you need, boy.
Put that right back.
Now, the reasons are two.
They're mine and yours.
Mine, if there are thousands of ampoules down there...
...and Cloche gets his hands on them...
...that junk will be on the street in New York in a week.
Yours, if you're lucky, it's the only one left...
...but if you go to the government, your treasure hunt will be off...
...and if there is any treasure down there...
...you'll just be reading about somebody else finding it.
David, please don't dive.
Make up your own mind, boy.
I have made up my mind, Treece.
I'm diving with you tonight...
...or I'm handing over all this information...
...to the authorities this afternoon.
Look, Gail, it's important to me.
You understand?
Listen, David, it's morphine.
Morphine.
We only met the man today.
Don't know anything more about him than you want to.
I can't afford to pass it up.
It's an experience.
Experience?
Don't you mean privilege?
- He suckered you in like a 5-year-old.
- Wait a minute.
I blackmailed him.
You remember that?
- Is that the way you remember it?
- Yes, because that's the way it was.
There's treasure down there, Gail.
I know. So I gotta go look.
You're so blind, you couldn't see it in front of you.
Well, look, I feel things, so I do them.
That's just the way I am.
And you wind up with T-shirts.
Oh, Jesus.
That's unfair. That's totally unfair.
Look, I didn't come here for you.
I came here for us.
So would you please think about it?
I always think about us.
Say, who is that guy?
I don't like him at all.
Well, you're going to have to because that's Kevin, he's family.
My mother liked him.
Told him to look after me.
Put your gear in the cabin.
Well, here I am.
I'm all ready. I've got all my gear.
I'm sorry you had such a long walk, because you're not diving tonight.
The hell I'm not.
That's my ship out there.
Those are my mates.
Your ship's dead.
So are your mates.
So were you too when I found you washed up on the beach.
And there's never bringing any of us back again, is there?
You just go on home now.
Good night.
- All set, captain?
- Aye.
Full moon tonight. We're gonna stick out like a cherry on a cream pie.
Cast her off forward, Kev.
Would you like some of that rum?
Yeah.
- There you go.
- No, thanks.
I never drink before I dive.
You know what they say about these waters?
If the Jamaican pirates don't get you...
...it'll be the cold embrace of the sea.
And that's no lover's kiss.
You know every ship from the New World...
...passed through these waters?
They had to.
Kangxi porcelain from China...
...Japanese silk screens...
...and those ivory doodads from India.
And all that Inca gold that Pizarro took out of Peru.
Do you believe all that, boy?
Yeah, I believe all of it.
Every bit of it. So do you.
You gonna marry that girl of yours?
Hey, boy.
We're getting very close now.
Four dots and a dash, that's your hotel.
Hey, Treece.
What do you do on a foggy night?
I just stay home and I drink rum.
Here, give me a hand, will you?
Hey, wait a minute.
This is explosives.
I don't wanna have anything to do with explosives.
If there are thousands of ampoules down there...
...I'm gonna rig the Goliath...
...so that I can topple it off the reef...
...out of anybody's reach forever.
So, what about the treasure?
Here, you'll need this.
Black as molasses.
Don't you go frightening anything down there.
What's wrong?
I'm not blowing it, not now.
That's the biggest moray eel I ever saw.
He wanted you for his supper.
What's the matter, boy?
Cheap Jack Bush.
Warning from Cloche.
- Cheap Jack what?
- Voodoo.
Cloche always likes to bring in a bit of Haiti with him.
Anybody take any notice of this...
...ought to have his brain examined.
Lights in your hotel have gone out.
We'll run the reef so I can drop you on the beach.
- All right.
- Get that anchor up.
- Yeah.
- Keep a sharp eye.
David?
Just a minute. I put the lock on.
David?
Who's there?
You gotta go starboard.
Port. Port.
I've been through this reef before.
Yeah, but the hotel beach is over there.
I know where the bloody beach is.
Okay, you're clear. You're clear.
Stop. Stop.
Goddamn it.
Gail?
Honey, what happened?
I haven't...
...felt like that...
...in my entire life.
- Okay.
- I was so helpless.
- It's all right, honey.
- David.
They...
They painted me.
- Quiet, now.
- David.
Come on, listen to me.
Listen. Listen.
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, okay, baby.
We'll go home.
We'll go home tonight.
Boy, the airport's closed.
No way off the island.
You best come home with me.
We're not going home with you,
Treece...
...because it's you and it's Cloche...
...and it's that goddamn morphine that almost got her killed tonight.
Boy, if Cloche wanted her dead, we'd be digging her grave by now.
He just wanted her as some kind of trump card...
...until he knew about the morphine.
You come home with me.
David, it's the only place you'll be safe tonight.
Don't worry. I'll make sure everyone's placed properly.
Right, but you, yourself, you watch the west side.
Make sure nobody comes over the swing bridge.
If he does come,
I hope it's my bloody way.
- Kevin.
- Aye?
You just take care of yourself.
Don't want anybody else to be hurt tonight. Go on.
How's your girl?
She's asleep.
Why didn't you blow that boat up?
Because of what you found, boy.
I think you ought to have a look at this.
Why, I never seen one like that before.
That's an 18th-century escutcheon plate.
You might be right, you see.
There just might be a king's ransom down there.
It would take three keys...
...to open the box that that plate came from.
Now, the captain would have one...
...the governor of Havana had two.
The owner would have all three in his possession...
...so only the owner could open them on his own, right?
A three-key lock like that is very rare. Very rare indeed.
Only used on nobility business.
What would a plate like this...
...be doing in the hold of a World War II munitions ship?
Yes, well, now, I don't know.
Suppose you have two storms...
...hundreds of years apart...
...springing up from the same quarter...
...and they catch two ships in the same circumstances...
...making for the same shelter.
Now, might they not drive them up on the same reef?
You think the current could bring that plate...
...up through the split in the hull?
Why hasn't anybody found this other ship?
I don't know yet, but I can tell you we'll find that in Havana manifesto.
I've got survivors' accounts, everything.
I ought to be able to tell you who that ship is, where she come from.
These are the Spanish, this is the English translation.
You and your beginner's luck, eh?
Mr. Treece.
If there is something more down there, what would it take to bring it up?
Well, under normal circumstances...
...using a sand gun and DESCO equipment...
...clear water and a lot of luck, just a few days.
But that hardly applies now, does it, since we got Cloche on our back?
- What would it take to get him off?
- Cloche?
Any deal that gets him the morphine,
I suppose.
But what do either of you care?
You're both going home tomorrow.
You'll be up to your neck in city smut by dinnertime.
Good God, what a world that is.
It made me climb the Statue of Liberty once.
It's dreams, Treece.
It's all daydreams.
It's a little more than daydreams, boy, when you find a three-lock box.
You see, by rights, you discovered her.
Whoever she is, you were the first to find her.
You would have left that plate there if I hadn't known it for what it was.
So that rolls me aboard as well.
Let me put it to you simple.
Whatever's down there, a lot or a little...
...half yours, half mine.
But the right to tell the world about it, that's all yours.
Come on up, okay?
Yeah, in a minute. Yeah, I'm coming.
Okay.
You're still there, girl?
Like a jar?
Warm you up.
Anyway...
...rum is not drinking, it's surviving.
You know what's got me stumped?
This is the Havana manifest right here.
It's clearly signed by the king's man in Havana...
...the Marquesa Cazaterras, governor of Cuba.
See, it states here that entire fleet sunk...
...off the coast of Florida in 1715.
That's King Philip's fleet, 1715.
Every ship, right?
All itemized, all recorded.
So, what I don't understand is...
...what is this ship doing down here in these waters...
...unitemized, unrecorded, unescorted...
...and carrying a three-lock box?
He's all right, that David of yours.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I apologise.
I lost touch why we even came down here.
I'll take you home.
You don't want to go home tomorrow.
I don't want to stay here without you.
Say that again.
I don't want to stay here without you.
Go away, will you?
That was a stupid business last night and cruel, very cruel.
You did not go to the police.
I've been tossing and turning all night wondering why.
There's thousands and thousands of ampoules of morphine down there.
You want them, and I got them.
They're still on the Goliath.
You have nothing but the gall to claim ownership.
I rigged that ship with booby traps last night.
She's wired to 10 ways to hell...
...and the wrong person goes down there, she'll blow.
You would need an advantage to deal with me.
I'll expect them in two days.
No, I shall need at least four.
We seem to have settled on three.
What sort of fee are you getting for diving these days?
One million dollars, cash, low denominations.
That's my share. You'll make twice as much as that in America.
Your attitude on drugs is a matter of record.
Why sell them to me for a profit?
I have my reasons.
Listen, I don't want any interference in this dive.
I know you'll be watching, but I don't want to see you.
And as for the young couple, you keep your hands off of them.
If you want me, you come and see me this time.
You know where I live.
Three days, Treece.
Three days.
Afternoon, Mr. Cloche.
Thank you, Kev.
Now, then. Listen, you two.
When this air gun gets going...
...I want you on my right, David, and you on my left, girl.
We pick up the ampoules as the sand gets sucked away...
...but be very careful of your hands.
When this thing's on full, it can swallow a cannonball.
How much of that junk are we gonna bring up?
Just enough to satisfy our audience up there on the cliff.
Oh, they're there, all right.
That Kevin sure gives me the willies.
He doesn't say much.
Maybe he don't like you, Adam.
He likes me. He's family.
Don't you worry about Kevin.
You just watch that little lever on that compressor.
Turn it off if there's any real trouble and don't forget to turn it on again.
And, boy, you feel that breeze cutting out of your hose, come up fast.
But be careful. It's just possible...
...there might be somebody waiting up there for you.
By rights, it should be me going down.
Now, let's not go into it again, Adam.
I got enough trouble looking after the boy here.
Don't worry, Treece.
I'm gonna go slow enough for you.
- I'm going in.
- Okay.
Gail's behind us.
Get closer.
I can't hear you.
You'll have to shout.
Right, David.
Now, keep those air hoses clear.
Right.
You go down.
I'll be right behind you.
Wait, wait.
That's where we saw the eel.
Come on.
David.
Lead it into the next compartment.
Keep your hands clear, girl.
Let's go look for the treasure.
All right.
Goliath's moving.
Kevin!
- David.
- Girl, you wait. I'll go.
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.
Look what I found.
Look what I found.
I don't care what you found. That was a bloody amateur thing to do.
I had to take the mask off.
I couldn't reach it.
Damn it. Look at it.
Gail, look. It's gold.
I knew there was treasure down here.
What kind of a ship was it?
Probably Spanish.
Might be a galleon.
Till you fell through the Goliath...
...this cave was all sealed up.
That tunnel I pulled you out of...
...it leads right down to the bottom of the reef.
Let's get out of here.
Goliath's on the move again.
It'll cut our hoses.
Up, now. Up, up.
- How many you reckon we have?
- About 4000.
Here you go, Kev.
Explosives?
What the hell are you doing that for?
- I'm rigging this.
- What the hell for?
Because this is the first place anybody would look for them.
If you hide the things somewhere else, you wouldn't have to blow your house.
But if I hide the things somewhere else...
...they wouldn't know where to look, would they?
I'm only gonna keep the buggers two days.
Kev, you stay ashore from now on.
Somebody's got to watch this place.
Right.
Oh, the hell. It still makes no sense.
What?
We know that the Grifon is the wreck underneath.
- We know that from the bell, right?
- Right.
But you see, it says here in the manifest...
...the Grifon was a French ship with a French captain...
...a tobacco ship.
It's allowed to tag along with the 1715 fleet...
...for protection from pirates.
That's here in the manifest.
You know what interests me?
The Grifon was the only ship to survive that hurricane.
She went back to Havana for repairs.
All right, but then what's she doing off of Bermuda...
...with part of that fleet's treasure?
- I don't know.
That's what I keep trying to puzzle out.
Because it says here the entire 1715 fleet...
...went down off Florida together, all 11 ships.
They say the fleet's treasure was aboard the flagship.
The sailing manifests prove it.
Then the governor, Cazaterras, the man I told you about...
...he reports everything's lost.
- Maybe he's wrong.
- No.
See, what we found is jewellery.
We didn't find the gold and silver from the fleet.
Jewellery and a Spanish three-lock box on a French tagalong tobacco ship.
Well, somebody could be lying.
Could be lying.
No, the Spaniards were fanatics for accurate records.
They always had everything like this rechecked by some important official.
Here it is again.
What?
"E.F."
Look at that.
What's something like that worth?
I don't know exactly what you got there.
Eight or nine ounces,
22-carat gold.
Good pearls.
Play it quiet, maybe $7500 on the market...
...less breakdown and melting costs.
You wouldn't melt a beautiful thing like that?
No, I wouldn't, but there are those who would.
And the ocean's not a jewellery store.
You don't get no receipts.
You got to prove that that's authentic.
- Anybody can see it's authentic.
- You don't understand me.
There's a lot of counterfeit on the market today.
I mean, it's real gold, it's real gems, but it's false.
No, you have to establish a provenance.
You gotta do that first.
You gotta find a proof that it's real.
Now, if we could find in here a verifying record...
...a description of any piece down there...
...that makes it all worth a bloody fortune.
Want to have your name on a plaque?
Want to be a celebrity?
No, there's not enough room in the Hamilton library.
I think they could find a bit of room for you, boy.
Well, it's possible, it's just possible...
...there's something else going on, but I don't know what it is.
Beat it out of me if you want to, but it won't do you any good.
I merely need information.
Which brings us, of course, to your fee.
How much is Treece paying you, by the way?
I'll pay 10 percent.
Done.
How many did they bring up today?
Six. Four thousand or so.
And yet Treece claims they're all down there?
That's what the girl says, yes.
It almost seems as if Treece is hiding something from both of us.
Doesn't it, my friend?
And we can't have partners who double-cross us...
...can we?
David?
You know, maybe you were right.
You know, I think somebody was lying and do you know who I think it is?
Governor of Havana.
Come here. Have a look at this.
See, this is the list he sent back to Spain...
...reporting the goods that were lost in the storm.
But according to this list...
...more was lost than the fleet's sailing manifest said was sent.
You know the difference?
The difference is jewels.
Not trinkets, mind you.
Masterpieces, works of art.
Two pages of the list were lost.
They never got to Seville.
That's where the original is.
You listen.
"A team of silver horses pulling a golden carriage.
A pair ofjade hummingbirds...
...one with wings of emeralds, the other with wings of pearl.
A golden dragon with emerald eyes."
Yeah, but does it say anything about what we found?
Like the pine cone filled with pearls...
...or the medallion itself?
No. Not on that page.
You know something?
This doesn't even look like a proper manifest to me.
It's not a manifest.
It's a shopping list.
- For a woman.
- For what?
It's a shopping list for a woman.
Gentlemen, I give you E.F.
- It's the lady on the medallion.
- The Duchess of Parma.
Oh, come on, Gail.
We've got an E.F., not a D.P.
The Duchess of Parma was her title.
Elizabeth Farnese was her real name.
- Come on, girl. Get on with it.
- Well, it seems that in 1714...
...when King Philip's first wife had just died...
...he developed a royal lust...
...for the beautiful
Duchess of Parma.
Well, she finally agreed to marry him, by proxy...
...but he wasn't there yet because
Elizabeth wasn't the kind of woman...
...to give away something for nothing, like her virginity.
And before he could touch that...
...she insisted that he deck her up with a set of jewels, quote...
..."unique in all the world," unquote.
Now, Philip commissioned those jewels to be made...
...and if that's what we found, he never got laid.
Beautiful. Just beautiful.
Yeah, she was a pretty smart lady.
You know, I've known him for three years...
...and all he's ever given me is a sweater and a pair of sneakers.
Well, he isn't the king of Spain, is he, girl?
What do you think?
Well...
Thinking aloud...
Just suppose you were the governor of Havana...
...with a three-lock box...
...and you knew it had something so personal...
...so valuable, belonging to the king of Spain.
You might not put it on a prime target like a flagship.
You might just put it on a French tobacco ship.
You know the fleet would be there for protection...
...but then the whole fleet sinks except the French tobacco ship...
...and the governor keeps to his story...
...and he lists the box as lost along with the fleet.
I'll buy it.
The Grifon sails again...
...and this time it gets caught in another hurricane off Bermuda...
...and it sinks.
The poor old governor of Havana...
...he has to go back to Madrid and live on his pension, right?
You know, girl, if we could just find one item down there...
...just one that's on your shopping list...
...we've found our bloody provenance.
That's why he wouldn't let me dive.
Damn you, Treece.
David?
"E.F." It's E.F. Again.
Treece. Treece.
Up. Up. Everybody, up.
The both of you, up.
Let me get this first.
- Get up.
- Let me get this first.
I don't care what you've found, boy.
Wait, get the dredge.
David, our only chance is to go up in the bubbles.
Take all the breath you can.
I'm gonna cut the air hoses, so stay close.
What the hell happened up here?
Old Fellini came by in his boat.
He was all rummed up.
God help me.
I must have been dozing or something.
When I looked out, all that stuff in the water...
...and the sharks were all over.
Why didn't you warn us on that compressor?
I was gonna turn it on, I was.
But then I knew you wouldn't know what kind of trouble you was in...
...and I might send you right into them.
Thank God you came through.
I knew there was more than morphine down there...
...all those ampoules coming up so slow like they were.
Yes. That's right, Adam.
I might just have saved your life for something after all.
Hey, boy. Get that dredge up.
There'll be no more diving today, not with all those sharks around.
All right, once again.
One more time, just for the hell of it.
Oh, I'm too tired.
Let's face it.
We haven't got our provenance.
All the jewellery we found must be on those missing pages.
Well, let's go over it again just one more time for the hell of it.
All right, and give me a rum, would you?
One golden ruby-studded cross.
Good morning.
Kevin.
Four tanks. They need filling.
Treece is expecting me.
They all up there?
Aye, they're there.
Gail, let me see the...
Let me see your sketch of the Grifon.
It's in my bag.
- Is there any fresh coffee, David?
- Yeah, it's on the table.
Wait a minute, this is the medallion.
I want the original one, the Goliath.
- It's in there too.
- No, it's not in here at all.
- It must be.
- Well, you come look.
You're right. It's not.
Adam.
I think I'll take a breath of air.
Do you mind locking up after me?
Thank you.
Jesus. That's it. That is it.
- What?
- I've seen this.
I've seen part of this.
I've seen part of this down there.
- Seen what?
- Well...
See, she's wearing a dragon pendant...
...but when you drew this, these lines,
I thought that was her dress...
...but you drew this before Treece cleaned the medallion.
Now, I've seen this chain.
I've seen this chain down there.
I was trying to get it.
On the list, there's something about gold chains...
...chains of gold.
Something like that.
- Nope, there's nothing about chains.
- Yes. Yes, there is.
There is a dragon pendant.
"A gold-jewelled dragon."
That's it. That's it.
Then the jeweller that made this pendant also made this medallion.
Now, if I go down there and I find the chain...
...and the dragon is at the end of the chain...
...then we've got our proof, babe.
We got our proof, huh? All right.
Kev?
Treece, we solved it.
It was here all along.
It's the provenance.
David's seen part of it down there.
- You solved nothing.
- What the hell you talking about?
I'm going to blow the Goliath now.
Why now?
Because if anything happens to me...
...there's nobody else left to do it.
What do you mean, if anything happens to you?
You go ahead and blow the Goliath,
Treece. You go ahead and blow it.
But first, I'm going down there.
I'm getting that provenance.
Go upstairs, pack, and go home.
To hell with it, Treece.
I'm not doing that.
I'm going down there...
...and you're gonna have to blow me up too.
As you please, boy.
Excuse me.
You don't need me down there, do you?
No, I don't think I do.
Coffin.
They killed Kevin.
David, I'm gonna signal you when I fire this fuse.
After that, I don't care if you've found the Holy Grail itself.
You've only got three minutes, so get out.
Listen. Now, don't worry.
Just turn on the air dredge when I get in, all right?
I'll be all right, huh?
David.
David! Here!
Daddy, do you know what I saw?
It was the most fantastic thing.
Come look.
My son.
Look, son,
I'm really busy... but I'll tell you what I do need.
I need some good luck.
Okay, Mr. Lucky, it's time we divvy up the loot.
Look at all of these things.
What a night.
What do you think of this?
This is pretty. I'll take those.
Try that. lsn't that pretty?
I better keep that.
That's pretty nice.
I think I better take that.
You shouldn't have that.
I better take that.
You're too young for that.
Look at that watch.
I'll take that.
That's a pretty watch.
It's time I got myself another knife.
So I oughta give you this.
You never know when a knife might come in handy.
You want some gold?
There's lots of gold.
You know, I'll bet this is the most valuable piece here.
It's Bucephalus, the magic horse of Alexander the Great.
A long time ago, this king was gonna kill Bucephalus... because he was so wild the king couldn't ride him.
He had Bucephalus brought into a big arena.
People came from all around.
They wanted to see this horse that was the biggest... and the blackest and the strongest, most beautiful horse that ever was.
King Philip walked out there and looked at some of his men.
He said, 'Kill that horse.'
Just then a voice called out from the edge of the crowd.
It said, 'I can ride that horse.'
Everybody said, 'Who said that?'
It was a little kid, just about your size, just about your age.
King Philip said...
'Son, if you can ride that horse, you can have that horse.'
So Alexander walked out into the big arena.
Standing in the middle of the arena was Bucephalus.
He was big, and he was strong.
He was pawing the ground... and there was fire in his eyes... and there was smoke coming out of his nose.
He went--
Alexander walked up... then quick as a cat, he jumped up on his back.
He grabbed hold of that long, black mane... and away they went, like lightning.
He jumped right over the crowd, over the stand... and went ridin' out over the hill.
Everybody said, 'Whew!'
Smoke comin' out of his nose!
Fire in his eyes.
Fire in his eyes!
That's the way I heard the story.
Here. I want you to have this.
Bucephalus.
Dad, what's going on?
- Ow!
- Alec!
- Alec, come here!
Just take it easy.
We'll be okay.
- What's happening?
- I don't know. Put this on.
Help me with this. Here.
Come here, son.
Put this life vest on.
It's okay.
Tie the bottom.
Let's get outta here!
Hang onto that rail!
Stay right there!
I'll be back!
Stay there! I'm gonna help these guys!
Don't move! Hang on!
- Help!
- Hey, Alec!
Dad!
Help!
Dad!
Help!
Help!
Help!
He saved my life.
I can't leave the island without him.
- He'll die without me.
Stop!
Let me go!
Black!
Black, come on!
Black!
'Ode to Alec Ramsey.'
'I think that I shall never see... a boy as brave as Alec Ramsey.
Hunger and thirst, in fear and pain.
He lived because his heart had aim.
A horse as black as night to day... a beast, a god... with whom he did stay.
They slept on the sand and played in the ocean.
And rode over the island in a singular motion.
Now, here he sits, a hero among boys... with the love of a horse, much more than mere toys.'
I'm very happy to have my son back.
Thank you. I wish you could have saved his father too.
You're kind of a pretty horse.
- What--
Black, no!
No!
Black, come back!
Alec!
Wow!
Yes, I saw a black horse!
It ran thataway!
Whoa.
What happened to you?
- Everything.
- Everything?
That's a whole lot.
Can't be everything.
You lost a black horse.
Yeah. Have you seen him?
Do you know where he is?
- Napoleon... did you tell me you saw a black stallion?
Well, what did he say?
He says,
'Well, not very far from here.'
Just past the dairy... there's a big black barn.
Then you see a long bunch of skinny trees... that you walk around.
Then you go right by a morning star.
You keep following that star... and see a large patch of green grass.
Then you stop.
Then you listen.
Pretty soon you'll see just what you've been looking for.
Hey, Black!
Black?
Black!
Black, it's you!
You okay?
I knew it was you.
What do you think you're doin' over there, sonny?
I'm gettin' my horse!
You're a big, fat thief!
- Nobody's a thief.
- You are!
I said, 'Nobody's a thief.'
Who do you think you're callin' a thief?
This is my place.
I'm thinkin' that's my horse.
No, he's mine!
Hold on, son.
Wait a minute.
- What are you gonna do here, buddy?
What are you gonna do?
Easy.
Maybe he is yours... but I spent all last night tryin' to catch this wild horse.
All night I spent.
You're just lucky I got him instead of the police.
Hear me?
He kicked a garbageman?
He's somethin', all right.
Did you have any breakfast?
Henry, I think he likes it out here.
Tried cows. It didn't work.
5:00 in the morning.
Chickens--
They just about drove me nuts.
Chickens.
Look, if you clean this stall up in here real good... and you get it fit for him,
I could let you have it.
There are too many red cards. ls The Black fast?
He's fast.
Fast enough to be a racehorse?
That Black is a desert horse.
He's fast, all right.
Sure, he's fast.
But he hasn't got any papers.
Fast or not, I don't think they'd ever let him run.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Why did you stop training?
I got tired.
Do you think you'll ever try it again?
Sure, I do.
Sure.
It's work.
Worth it, though.
Hold onto him good, son.
Stay in the center of him.
Turn him around the other way.
The other way, son.
Bring him in and turn him around.
Now send him down around here.
It comes as no surprise that again this week... both Sunraider, the fiery red stallion from the West... and Cyclone, the sleek gray from the East... have won their races with ease.
They have won with monotonous regularity.
But, hey-hey, let's see these two champions... run head-to-head.
Perhaps horse fans will be treated to the match race of the century.
This is 'Hey-Hey' Jim Neville, from Belmont.
Lookin' this way.
Not lookin' down on the ground.
Lookin' straight ahead.
That's right.
You want to see what's comin', you look underneath your arm.
Not over your shoulder.
Down under here. ln here. See what's going on down there, all around you.
You can scoot and boot, understand?
Then you've got your balance.
Keep your knees in close when you're puttin' your stirrups on.
Check down underneath here too.
Get that leather outta your way.
Pull it back in there underneath so that your knees--
Nothin' in the way in here.
All right.
Now you're up. Feel that?
Feel that in your legs?
Hmm? Feel it pullin' on your legs back here?
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.
Look ahead down the lane.
No, you don't jump straight up and down.
Just try and keep your body as still as possible.
He'll be movin'.
He'll be makin' that rhythm.
You just go on with him.
You don't have to pump him.
Just kind of go straight ahead with him.
Just like you're throwing it away, like this.
Throw it away.
That's right.
Throw it away.
That's right.
When a horse starts outta that gate, you've got to remember this.
Remember, you don't want him to outbreak you.
You know what that means?
That horse starts to settle--
They open that gate, wham, like that.
Some of 'em just scat!
You can't do that, so you grab a handful of mane... just before he says, 'Go,' so he don't outbreak you.
Because they'd open that gate, and you'd just be sittin' in midair.
You understand?
- This Black can outbreak you.
- Right.
He can move right on out there.
You know, Alec...
'secrecy.'
That's the key word.
Yeah. Okay.
Don't just say, 'Okay.'
Know what I'm talking about.
It's a secret.
You and me, we have a secret.
Now, listen to me.
We'll just make this an easy workout.
- You understand?
- All right.
Get him used to this place.
Jake and I will be here with Napoleon.
You go down to the half-mile pole and watch me.
I'll give you the start by dropping my hand.
Then I want you to work him for a half mile.
I want to you to breeze him for a half mile... then pull him up, nice and easy.
Go down to the half-mile pole and watch me.
Come on! Let's go!
Too much horse for your boy.
Jake, he's gonna be all right.
Hyah. Come on, Nappy.
Let's go.
- Whoa.
Come on! Giddap! Go on, get him!
Pull him up!
Pull him up, Nappy!
On the inside!
Come on, Jake.
Hey, your hand's-- You all right?
I'm okay.
I better walk him now.
All right, go ahead.
Cool him out, son.
Did you get what I got?
Right on the button.
That horse has got speed he ain't even tapped yet.
You're not--
You're not actually--
You're not.
You are outta your mind.
That monster has no more business being out on this track with class--
He's fast, but he's wild.
You saw him zigzagging all over the course.
What about his papers?
- He ain't got any.
- He ain't?
That's taste.
What are you gonna do?
Hitch him up to a plow?
No.
I got an idea.
A match race?
Cyclone?
You are too much.
You are really too much.
You got me thinking crazy too.
Squeeze my hand.
I want to try something here.
You feel that?
That's a pretty good grip.
That's not bad, but we're gonna have to work on your grip.
What I used when I was a rider was this ball. See how--
- What does a ball do?
- It strengthens your band.
No matter what you're doin' through the day, just use this ball.
Let me see you do it. Next time you grip my hand, we'll see a difference.
This reporter has the hottest racing news of the year.
Hold onto your hats.
The most sensational match race imaginable... between Cyclone from the East and Sunraider from the West... is finally set for the afternoon of August 15 at Santa Anita.
They'll go over two gruelling miles to prove once and for all... which is really the greatest champion.
This is 'Hey-Hey' Jim Neville from Belmont.
Well, whoever you are... here we go.
It's open.
Sure is quiet in here today.
Anything wrong with that?
The Black, he--
He just wouldn't play.
He just stands there and looks out into the rain.
Maybe The Black is blue today.
- Did you ever think of that?
- 'Blue'?
Rain, man, rain.
Rain.
We're gonna show everybody that he's the fastest horse in the world.
You think you know that animal?
Yeah, I know him.
I don't know.
I get a funny feeling.
I feel right now that you better let that horse stay wild, Alec.
It's his soul.
Easy, Black.
- He ain't gonna show.
- I don't wanna hear that.
He'll show. He'll be here.
He probably doesn't even remember us.
- He'll be here.
- We're ancient history.
I tell you, he's gonna be here.
He's busy.
He's a little jumpy.
Come on. We'll work him.
Get him out there.
Henry!
- You okay?
- Where'd he get you?
- On my arm.
- Here?
- ls it broken?
- Leave it alone!
It's all right.
He just nicked me.
Will you please stop?
All right. What?
It's him.
- It's him.
- No.
It's him, by God.
I tell you, it's him.
It is him.
Yeah. All right. It's him.
All right. Give him a leg up there.
Remember, this is our big chance.
It's up to you.
Take him out.
Come on! Bring him on!
Hey! He's out cold.
He passed out.
Get him out of that mane.
Hold him steady.
- Got him.
- Give me your knife.
- All right.
- Watch it. Hold him steady.
Whoa, sonny.
Here.
- Where'd you get this animal?
- Get him off.
Good boy.
- Get him outta here.
- I got him.
Watch yourself.
Watch it, sir.
Whoa, boy.
What happened?
Did I fall off?
No.
No, you hung on like a champ.
What happened?
Where's The Black?
It's all right.
Don't worry about it. It's fine.
He's over in the van with Nappy.
He did good, didn't he?
He did great.
You did great.
You all right?
- How did you like what you saw?
- I wasn't disappointed.
Disappointed?
You never saw a horse run like that in your life.
This could put you back in the action, eh, Dailey?
Don't get hard with me.
You know I never liked it.
I need this race.
I need it bad, and you can do it.
Will you do it? lf that horse goes like that with a kid...
- what will he do with a real rider?
- The race.
Nice going, kid.
You got guts.
You heard me say that Cyclone and Sunraider... are the fastest horses in the world today.
I'm going to eat those words now because I've seen another horse... that defies the imagination, that runs like a demon possessed... at night, alone, at speeds beyond belief.
He's never run a race, and he comes out of nowhere... but he could be the greatest sensation in racing history.
So I challenge the owners of both Cyclone... and Sunraider to meet this mystery horse in their upcoming match race.
This isn't a joke.
This mystery horse is real, and I'll stake my reputation on it.
This is 'Hey-Hey' Jim Neville from Belmont.
Do you know any real good, famous jockeys?
There are a lot of 'em.
George Wolf, the lceman.
That's just what they call him.
Georgie Wolf.
They call him in the newspapers the lceman... because he sits chilly on a horse.
That means he sits there and he can wait.
He knows what to do.
He's studying a horse.
He's up there ridin', goin' on with him.
You know what I mean?
He's sittin' up there, goin' on... just studyin' him!
Studyin' him.
Just studyin' him.
When it's time to make his move... he'll say--
Here comes the lceman!
Mom, do you want me to mow the lawn... or wash the dishes or something?
Sure.
Why don't you make all the beds and vacuum in here too?
- Mom, have you read this here? See?
- What is it?
This is more about that mystery horse.
Boy.
Remember last year when they were giving away aluminum ballpoint pens?
- The Black is the mystery horse.
- It's amazing the lengths... they will go to get people to go to a horse race.
And I'm gonna ride him.
- I'll get it!
What did you say? Wait!
Alec, wait one more second.
What did you say? Say that again.
The Black is the mystery horse, and I'm gonna ride him.
Alec, that horse is not the mystery horse.
Even if he were, you're not gonna ride him.
It was a secret.
I told you as soon as I could.
You're not supposed to keep secrets from your mother.
- Someone's at the door.
- I know!
- Mrs. Ramsey, how--
- Oh.
The Black is the mystery horse, and you're gonna ride him in a race.
All right. Well, well, well. lsn't this just fascinating timing?
What's been going on between you two guys and that horse?
- I have a right to know.
- Guess you've been talking to Alec.
I have been trying to. Would you like to tell me something about this?
- I'd be happy to.
- Come in, please.
It's quite a long story,
Mrs. Ramsey.
I'm sure it's a long story.
But you've got to be kidding, thinking I'll let him ride in a race.
My son could get killed in a horse race.
I think you could be exaggerating.
I'm not exaggerating.
Don't lie to me, Mr. Dailey.
You're willing to risk his life?
I'm not willing to risk his life.
I've lost a husband, and I'm not gonna lose a son.
I wouldn't hurt that boy for anything in the world.
What kind of dreams are you filling his head with?
It's much more than just a race.
Your son has his heart set on it.
Good-bye, Mr. Dailey.
Good-bye, Mrs. Ramsey.
So what happened to the new deal, the clean slate?
Alec, I can't let you ride in that horse race.
It's ridiculous.
I'm sorry.
What is that?
Alexander the Great's horse.
Dad gave it to me... just before the storm.
It reminds me of The Black and me.
Alexander's father gave it to him... before he died.
I was in the water.
I couldn't breathe.
It was dark and... l--
I yelled out for Dad, but--
I looked up, and there was The Black... and I grabbed onto him.
He saved your life, didn't he?
Oh, Alec.
What am I gonna do?
I gotta ride.
Okay, Alec.
Neville planned the publicity?
I'll bet the mystery horse don't even show.
Did you see that?
I'll beat him.
- I heard Mendoza's comin' in.
- Who's missing from the room?
- That beats him right there.
- Yeah. Who rides him?
Where did that guy over there get them silks?
- Looks like he's ready for Halloween.
- It sure does.
Rider number one, up.
- Number one, sir.
- Add two pounds.
Got that, George?
Rider number two now.
Thank you.
Rider number three.
Number three?
Number three?
How do I look?
Number three, please.
I don't think he's gonna show.
It's been a joke.
The mystery rider.
Hop on the scale.
-He's not strong enough to go two miles.
-No way. Too small.
- Rider on the scale, please.
- He's on the scale, sir.
He's on the scale?
Add it on.
Okay. All right.
Take him out.
All right, bring him right on out.
Two miles.
They'll come by the stands twice.
The stands are jammed.
He's moving on the black horse, the mystery horse.
Bring that horse.
Cyclone, settle! Whoa!
Whoa!
Stop, Black!
There's some problem with the mystery horse.
Cyclone keeping the pace.
They're in the front turn now.
He's won!
The mystery horse won!
This, ladies and gentlemen--
This horse has got a leg like iron.
It's gonna be all right, son.
Henry!
Well, here we are!
You're Tony and you're Tia.
- Ma'am.
- Hello, Mrs. Grindley.
Oh, such fine-looking children.
I know you're anxious to see your rooms, but first we have some forms to fill out.
Then we'll join the others for dinner, all right?
Tia, what a pretty case!
Well.
It ain't nothing writing out those entry forms.
Wait'll she lays one of those enlightened punishments on you.
"After you watch the 5:00 news, you can write a 500-word composition."
Brother!
Tony, what should I put after sports?
Hmm, put "spectator."
Dumb pen's out of ink.
I'm finished. You can use mine.
Hey, I lost one just like this when I was coming in this barn.
- Tia's had that since Christmas.
- Sure she has.
Give it back!
Take it.
Now, children, that wasn't so difficult, was it?
No, ma'am.
Now, then.
Truck, I want you to wait for me in my office.
We'll read this together.
I keep forgetting what it feels like to sit down.
Now then, I know how both of you must feel.
Your foster parents are the only parents you remember.
Now that they've passed away, you're just a little bit scared.
We loved them very much.
Yes, ma'am, we miss them.
You only remember your adoptive name? Malone?
Tia was around three and I was five when the Malones adopted us.
Did either of you ever receive a birthday card from a relative?
Or perhaps a phone call at Christmas?
Something you may have forgotten.
Oft times the most trivial thing is important.
Tia?
What is it, dear? You look as though you're remembering something.
No. No, Mrs. Grindley. I'm sorry.
Why, there's nothing to be sorry about, dear.
You're out, Truck.
Nobody can jump that high, Malone.
You stood on something.
- Great catch!
- How'd you do it anyhow?
You're just trying to rip me off.
I was safe at third.
Safe. There's something funny about this. I'm gonna teach you a lesson.
Tony...
Cut it out, all right?
Ow!
Tony, why'd you do that?
You don't think we're gonna get away with it, do you?
You see?
Tony, you promised me and I promised you.
We wouldn't... You know, do the kind of stuff you did with Truck.
You remember how it used to be, when we thought it was all funny.
Like a game.
All the other kids thought we were some kind of freaks or witches.
I know, Tia.
We lost all of our friends until we quit doing all the spooky stuff.
You should've let Truck beat up on you.
Are you kidding? He's got five inches and 50 pounds on me.
Then you should've made it look like he was winning.
I suppose.
Tony?
Do you hear the dogs?
No. How far?
Oh, about 20 miles.
Big dogs, six or seven.
Yeah. I can hear them now.
That's awful far. Even for us.
Why are we hearing them, Tony?
I think it means that we're gonna see 'em someday.
If the bus is any later, Mrs. Grindley, we'll miss the beginning of the picture.
- Yeah.
- I'll see what's keeping them.
All right, Truck.
You guys, wanna see something really neat?
That's my star case, Truck.
And you're his sister.
Tony, please, not another fight.
It's your star case, Tia.
He might smash it.
Give it back to Tia now.
I'll fight you with one hand.
I'll fight you with none.
Come on!
The bus is here.
Nice going, Winkie.
Hey, Tony and Tia, come on!
What's taking you? Come on!
Hurry up!
Tony, across the street!
Big car? What about it?
Something's going to happen to it.
There's a man.
He mustn't get into that car.
There he is!
Come on!
Please, sir, don't get in that car.
It's no joke, sir.
See, my sister gets these feelings.
- So, you mustn't get in the car.
- Please, sir.
Children, you know the rules about leaving the group.
No. I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- That's all right.
- Excuse us, please.
I've changed my mind.
I'd like to take a walk.
- Pick me up by the park.
- Yes, sir.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir.
The moon is moving into Aries.
Friday it will near the middle of the transit.
The bottom line, Mr. Michael-John.
The bottom line, Mr. Bolt, shows considerable indications of some advance toward your goals.
What about the house guru?
Do you concur, Ali?
There are profound vibrations, Mr. Bolt.
Are there indeed?
Vibrations. My moon in Aries.
Mysterious words and phrases have not added one red cent to my fortune.
Wealth, gentlemen, is like flesh.
It has to be nurtured and coddled.
Ah, Mr. Deranian.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bolt, but when you've heard my report,
I think you'll understand.
I have found what you're looking for.
Wait here a minute.
I haven't had a chance to thank you.
- Was the man in front all right?
- The chauffeur, yes. He's fine.
But then you knew he would be or you'd have had him get out of the car, too.
I suppose this sort of thing happens to you all the time, hmm, young lady?
Knowing about things before they really happen?
The lunch bell. We have to go.
Excuse me.
Those two children that just left.
I've been trying to think of their names.
Tony Malone and his sister, Tia.
A couple of weirdos.
Suppose somebody else had walked in?
Everybody knocks. Pine Woods' rules.
Look.
Must've happened when Winkie knocked it out of Truck's hands.
Can you fix it?
It's a map, isn't it?
"Stony Creek"?
"Misty Valley"?
It's funny, Tia, but every once and a while you get that look on your face.
Like you're remembering something.
I kind of do, but then I forget again.
It's not someplace big, like a state or a country.
But more like a road map.
I just don't know where.
When I can figure out where this place is, we'll go there.
Tony, what were you drawing?
It's the place where those dogs are.
They're barking now.
Yeah, I know. I was listening to them before you butted in.
I began to visualize this castle...
Tony, you can only visualize places we know something about.
Or places we're gonna be at.
I must've been drawing someplace we're going to.
Soon, Tony.
We're going there soon, and I'm afraid.
Since the Malones lived in a very small village,
I had little difficulty finding people who knew the children.
These insights, these sixth-sense incidents...
The postman, the schoolteacher, the woman who lost her parakeet, how do I know these aren't the result of your desperation?
Figments of your very fine imagination?
I have sworn affidavits.
People lie very easily. The very young can deceive the very wise.
I'm not lying.
If I'm in any way disappointed in this Tony and Tia, you are through here, Deranian.
Yes. I understand.
Then bring them here.
You say they have no family.
Well, now they do.
You are their family, Deranian.
You are their uncle, do you understand?
Perfectly.
Alter records. Forge documents.
Provide proper papers.
Whatever it takes. I will back you with every means at my disposal.
Just bring me the children.
I think there's no question, considering these documents your uncle has produced, that he has custody of you.
The judge signed those papers just today.
Mr. Deranian...
Uncle Lucas, Tony. Better get used to it.
Uncle Lucas, did you tell Mrs. Grindley about the first time we ever saw you?
Yes, he did.
The day the tow truck ran into your uncle's car.
That was a lucky day for all of us.
You see, Tia, you bear such a remarkable resemblance to Mr. Deranian's sister that he's convinced you both are her children.
My sister, your mother, died six years ago.
Now, if you have any doubts,
I'd be happy to show you these documents that prove he is your Uncle Lucas.
I won't have to leave Winkie, will I?
He's very smart and he knows how to deal with dogs.
Did I mention dogs?
Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Grindley.
I'll see you out, Mr. Deranian.
Children, don't forget your coats.
Do you have any feelings about this Mr. Deranian?
Only that he isn't our uncle.
Must we leave, Tony?
That's what these papers mean.
We haven't got a choice.
It's all right, Lorko,
I'm just bringing through the children.
I'm sorry, but I'm allergic to cats.
Let us through.
Those are the dogs we heard.
There's the mansion.
Just the way you drew it, Tony.
Uncle Lucas, what's "Xzanthus"?
It's "Xanthus," Tony.
Mr. Bolt calls his house "Xanthus."
Who's Mr. Bolt?
Mr. Bolt is my employer.
And your host.
I have spacious apartments here.
And thanks to Mr. Bolt's generosity, they've been enlarged and redecorated to accommodate the two of you.
So, this is your long lost family?
You have a very beautiful niece, Deranian.
And a most attractive nephew.
You're Tony and you are Tia.
Here.
Our favorite flavors, vanilla and strawberry.
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.
After that long drive,
I'm sure you youngsters would like to see your quarters. Come with me.
Wow! It's beautiful.
- Isn't it cute?
- I must be dreaming.
Tony, look at that!
Hey, look!
Oh, wow!
Look at these dolls and stuffed animals.
Whoa!
Hey, Tony!
- When all this is completed...
- There's more?
Oh, yes!
We haven't had time yet to install the carousel or the gymnasium.
The tennis court's being resurfaced.
You can start your riding lessons first thing in the morning.
Oh, wow!
- We love horses.
- Oh, I forgot!
Winkie's private quarters.
Look, I think he likes it.
They're really great.
Of course, you still have your schoolwork.
Your tutors arrive the first of the week.
Mr. Bolt, where are the others?
- Other kids?
- Neighbors, I mean.
There are no neighbors.
Look out the window, go on.
Look as far as you can see.
Mr. Bolt owns everything in sight.
Well, I can see the sky.
I saddle him myself because this is your first time out, but one thing to remember, always mount a horse on his left side because...
Tia? You better pay attention or you'll be sorry.
Mr. Duncan, that horse over there.
That's old Thunderhead.
He's never been broke.
I don't envy the cowboy who'll try it.
I know it should be "ladies first," but I think if you show Tia how easy it is...
A little filly the size of your sister, sometimes they get scared.
Thunderhead, that's not nice.
My name's Tia.
And I want to be your friend.
All right, Thunderhead?
Tia! Stay away from him!
Hold on, now!
Good boy.
You know, I've never seen anything like this in all my life.
Tia! Come here.
Hey, Tony, why don't you try it without your harmonica?
I forget how.
Come to think of it, you can do a lot of things I can't.
Like working locks and the way you can talk to me without moving your mouth.
Maybe it's because you're a girl.
That's the most incredible thing
I've ever seen.
Thank you, but we've a long way to go.
I'm having more hidden cameras installed and as soon as I have enough evidence,
I'm going to show the tapes to the children.
Good. If that doesn't put them on my team, then we'll have to resort to cruder methods of persuasion.
Tia?
Tia?
Tia, what's the matter?
Oh, everything and nothing.
I mean, maybe it's because we've gotten everything we've ever wanted.
More, even.
It's... I don't know.
It just doesn't leave us anything to wish for. Is that it?
I think so.
Tony, we've got to get out of here before it's too late, please.
- What do you see?
- Mr. Bolt, and he's mean.
He's never gonna let us go, Tony.
You're not always right about things like this.
I think this time...
This time...
You're right.
I've enjoyed this.
You should ask Uncle Lucas to arrange it so you can dine with me more often.
Thank you, Mr. Bolt.
We had some fine, stimulating conversation.
However...
Let us dispense with the kid gloves, and acknowledge the fact that we're dealing with two remarkable children.
Mr. Bolt, I really don't think you...
It doesn't matter what you think, Deranian.
If these youngsters are psychic, it's obvious they've begun to see through us by now.
- Don't lay all...
- You have power. I've seen it.
Now, I don't mean to ridicule those gifts of yours, as others might.
I revere them. Do you believe that?
What power do you mean, Mr. Bolt?
He knows. He knows all about us.
I don't think we know what you mean, Mr. Bolt.
What you did with Thunderhead and the marionettes.
And the dozens of things
I've seen on my TV console.
I want to know. I want to be able to understand these powers.
But that's impossible without your help.
You can make it possible.
You could walk across a field and tell where there's oil far beneath it.
You could foresee a revolution.
A natural disaster.
Please, Mr. Bolt, you're too excited.
You're going to make yourself sick.
You should go right to bed, sir.
Yes.
Yes, I will.
Anything.
Anything in this world you ask me for,
I'll bring you. Just never leave me.
Not another word. Into bed.
Uncle Lucas, you look like you could use some extra sleep yourself.
You heard what he said. He wants to learn all the things we know.
We couldn't teach him, even if we wanted to.
We... We don't know why we do all these things.
We don't know how it all started.
Tony, we've got to get out of here, please.
But to what, Tia?
Where do we go? Not to mention how.
The map.
- Mr. Bolt...
- Listen a second.
Don't lay all your cards on the table now.
They're very cunning.
I don't know the full extent of their powers.
Here they could escape.
But the chalet is an island in a sea of blinding snow.
They'll never escape from there.
Nutty as a fruitcake.
You see, we have to get out of here.
I know, but there's all that high fence
- and the guards...
- Children.
Finish up your ice creams and I'll show you to your bedrooms.
He's coming.
Come on.
So far, so good.
Come on!
Those dogs have ruined all my plans.
What do you mean, it's too late?
- Now!
- Dogs, stay.
Stay!
Good dogs.
There are some very bad men after us.
Go get 'em!
There's still the main gate.
They're not going to stop chasing us, even if we get past this gate.
Call Thunderhead.
Thunderhead, remember what I told you?
We're at the gate now.
- Lorko's on that lever.
- I'll help.
Winkie! Winkie!
Winkie!
Find them! I don't care how you do it.
Chase them on a magic carpet if you have to, but I want those kids back!
They rode out of here!
They're... They're quite a challenge.
I will not rest until I get those children back and neither will you.
I'm a vengeful man, Deranian.
I don't make idle threats.
Find them!
- You'll be all right here, big fella.
- Thank you, Thunderhead.
We'll miss you, Thunderhead.
Those sirens are for us.
We've got to keep moving. Come on.
They're getting closer.
Looks like you're taking a mighty long trip, friend.
Yeah, I figured I'd drive all over these United States.
Well, sir, a covered wagon pulling out of St. Joe didn't take near as much supplies as you got yourself here, Mr. O'Day.
You're sure one well-informed man, aren't you?
Now, do you think you could hand me that carton without straining yourself, or are you just tuckered out from sticking your nose in my affairs?
We're looking for two children.
A boy and a girl. Runaways.
Mister, if I did see 'em
I'd just as soon let 'em keep running.
As long as they're going opposite to where I'm headed.
Well.
What do you know about that?
A drifter, huh?
Hey, you're a friendly little fellow, aren't you?
Hey, I've got some canned tuna for you.
Hey, what are you doing here in my...
Uh, yesterday when I was loading supplies, they were looking for two kids.
Ah, a boy and a girl! You two.
Well, let's get one thing straight right here and now. I ain't no bus line.
And I ain't partial to hitchhikers.
And I don't like kids.
And what's more,
I'm a mean, impatient, selfish man, so come out of here and get on your way. Out! Out! Out!
Come on, out. On your way.
Wait a minute.
It ain't right for no human being to go hungry.
I'll make you some breakfast before you go.
Now don't get any ideas.
I got no patience with kids.
Especially runaways.
But it's just the opposite, sir.
We're trying to find where home is.
Excuse me, but did you see a black cat?
Oh, yeah. Yours, huh?
Well, she's around somewhere.
Go on down to the water and clean yourselves off.
He just likes to bellow a lot.
He's not really mean.
You've got to be kidding.
Sorry, Mr. Deranian. No sign of them.
A grocer reported loading up one of these big campers, about the time they got away.
- They could have hidden in there.
- Any one of you spot a camper?
I let one go through.
The driver was alone.
Big fellow? Older guy?
A zip-up jacket with fair-colored hair?
That's the one. He was in a recreation vehicle heading north on highway L-38.
All right, north on highway L-38.
Now get out an APB on an RV heading north on L-38.
You see, Mr. O'Day, we don't expect to find our real parents, but maybe someone who knew them.
And can explain things to us.
We've got to make sure
Mr. Bolt and Deranian don't catch us.
Well, maybe that's the truth, and maybe it ain't.
But I'm not going to complicate things.
I'm gonna be on my way.
What did I do with my keys?
I know I had them in my...
I must have lost them out there.
You should have a spare key, sir.
I know that, young lady.
I am not a losing man.
Least not till you showed up.
Sir? Do you know a place called Stony Creek?
Stony Creek? Yes. Good fishing there.
- If we get the motor started...
- And clean up the back section...
Will you take us there?
Ah.
So that's it!
You're nothing but a conniving pair of undersized land pirates!
You swiped my keys to make sure you'd get a ride!
- Give me my keys.
- Sir?
The engine will start now.
All right.
You go back there and you clean up.
Make everything shipshape.
I'll see that you get to Stony Creek.
You just remembered something.
It has something to do with the ocean.
Come on.
Go on back, clean up.
Let's get on the way.
Sure is a nice day.
Not with the prices you charge for gas.
Keep real still.
This fellow's acting mighty peculiar.
Nobody can know we're with you.
Maybe not. At least you'll be out of my hair by tomorrow.
We should make it to Stony Creek by then.
- How much?
- $10 even.
There you are.
Mr. O'Day? I think you bought too much.
Yeah, Winkie can't drink four quarts of milk between now and tomorrow!
Well, if you two weren't joshing me about Aristotle Bolt being after you, we might be together longer than we'd planned.
He's a powerful man, too po...
Motorcycle cop.
That attendant at the gas station.
You won't get in trouble, will you, Mr. O'Day?
It's not me he's after.
On second thought,
I might not drop you off too soon.
I might be able to squeeze an honest day's work out of you.
Take you fishing.
Deep-sea fishing, maybe.
Pit you two against half a ton of blue marlin.
Tia, what are you thinking about?
About before. It had to do with fishing.
- With Daddy Malone?
- No. No.
But we were on a boat.
A trawler.
Like Daddy Malone had.
That's all I remember.
Every law man in the county is probably looking for this camper.
There you are. Some hot chocolate?
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.
- What's that you have there?
- My star case.
Here. Let me show you what we found in the secret compartment.
- See where Stony Creek is, Mr. O'Day?
- Yes.
Well, there's a path that leads away from it. Up into some mountains.
We think that's where we may come from.
Somewhere in those mountains.
No, I don't think it was that way.
Not exactly.
There was an accident.
Well, go on!
I... It's gone.
What kind of an accident?
I don't know.
- In a car?
- No.
At... On the ocean!
Someone helped me save my star case.
Well, who?
Whoever put the map in the star case hid it so well, it took you all these years to find it.
That's right, Mr. O'Day.
Why would anybody do that?
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe waiting for you to get old enough to do something about it.
Like now!
Very peculiar, huh?
I wonder...
I wonder how I'd handle you kids if you were mine.
Well...
Maybe that's why I never married, huh?
But, Mr. O'Day...
You were married.
What?
A long, long time ago.
And she was so pretty.
And you had a little house.
Yeah, I can see it.
It was white, with yellow shutters.
And there was a big elm branch over the whole roof.
Tony knows about people.
He can see places they've been.
- What else?
- Well, your wife died.
Only a few months after you were married. And you were so sad.
You took an oath that you'd never give your love to another woman, or to anyone.
And you never have.
I'm sorry, Mr. O'Day.
The name's Jason.
If you know so dang much about me, you might as well use it.
- Jason, you understand?
- I like the name Jason.
We didn't mean to make you sad, Jason.
Come on. Are we going to dawdle here all night? Let's clean up here.
Get some sack time in.
We'll pull out of here a couple of hours before sunup.
They're headed towards Longview.
Do you understand that, Sheriff?
Mr. Deranian, $1,000 reward speaks mighty clear in these parts.
You can count on me.
- Yes, I'll do that, Sheriff.
- It's been a pleasure, a real...
A real pleasure.
Hey, Ubermann. Over there.
This time no mistake.
Now, listen close.
We're coming into Longview.
My brother's house is about two miles outside of town up the north road.
His name is Hiram O'Day.
There's a car behind us, Jason.
Somewhere in Longview I'll find a place to make a fast turn and a quick stop.
You two jump out the side door and hide, you got that?
Sure, Jason. You watch Winkie, now.
Yeah.
I'll keep going. If luck is with us,
Deranian and his pal will follow me.
You wait till he gets past.
Then we'll head for your brother's house, right?
Hiram O'Day.
Don't lose him.
Well, now! Welcome to Longview.
6:10 a.m. Okay, let's have your names.
- Tony Castaway.
- Tia Casta...
Castaway? That's no name, it's a word.
Your legal name is Malone, and don't go kidding me about that.
I think I'll let you see what lying to the law gets you.
Hmm.
In you go.
Tony, I've been thinking about why we would have said our name is "Castaway."
I think it might have something to do with us speaking another language.
- When the Malones took us in.
- Another language?
That's why we didn't talk for so long.
You mean we had to learn English?
We spoke a funny kind of language.
Uncle Bene spoke it to us.
Who's Uncle Bene?
I...
I think he died. Drowned.
What did he look like?
He had white hair...
I'll tell you, we don't want no panic around here, Sheriff.
Well, I've been in touch with Mr. Deranian and he's on his way.
I'll be home if you need me, Sheriff.
Tia, we've gotta think of something fast.
Hey, Tony, look.
Tony, that bear looks so unhappy.
Tia, we need my harmonica.
Now open the cell door.
When I get the star case, you run out to the edge of the woods.
As soon as I free the bear, I'll be there.
Tia, how do you expect us to get anyplace with a great big bear?
He's counting on me.
But this is an emergency.
Come off it, will you?
We still have to get past the sheriff.
Why don't you start thinking about that?
Hey. Hey, what?
Get that thing off of me!
I just hope we don't have to pass a zoo before we get where we're going.
Look, I know what I saw!
And I say there's only one explanation!
Those two kids are witches!
And they're from Witch Mountain.
I want every available townsman to arm themselves, and we'll divvy up into hunting groups.
Hey, Sheriff. Whatcha gonna do, chase them all the way to Witch Mountain?
Yeah!
We'll stop them before they get there!
Now you listen close and I'll give you the areas to cover.
Those look like hunting parties.
They got away, Mr. Deranian, but we know what they are.
Evil itself. We got to catch them.
He's right. They're from Witch Mountain.
Sheriff, we need some more ammunition.
All right.
We'll get them, Mr. Deranian.
They've really got blood in their eyes.
There's no use trying to reason with them now, sir.
Security? This is Deranian.
I want a complete check on a Jason O'Day.
Tia, I know how you feel about the bear, and I think he's real neat too, but...
Well, a lot of people are gonna be looking for us, and he'll be safer on his own.
Anyway, they might shoot him.
Just for the sport of it.
Look.
He'll be safe there until tonight.
Then he can move on when it's dark.
Maybe you're right. I'll talk to him.
You be a good bear and wait in that cave.
We don't want anything to happen to you.
Tony, his feelings were hurt.
Watch it!
Jason!
Oh!
These woods are full of hunters looking for you. They think you're witches.
Brother Hiram ain't home, but I'll get you some food.
You'll have a good rest.
There's a brother. Hiram O'Day.
244 Cahill, just north of Longview.
Fifteen minutes.
We can be there in 15 minutes.
But I still can't figure out why we both came up with a name like "Castaway."
I noticed that you two are very smart for your years.
You really know what a "castaway" is?
Sure. It's like being shipwrecked and left on a desert island.
- Ah.
- Tony, I just remembered!
"Castaway." That's the name of someone we're supposed to see.
That's funny.
I just remembered the same thing.
But suppose you two are castaways?
Then it would sure fit things Tia's been remembering.
Uh-huh.
We were in some kind of wreck, Jason.
And we were in the sea.
You mean like a boat sinking?
I guess. But if it was a boat,
I don't remember where it came from.
We had an uncle.
Uncle Bene.
He kept us afloat. And then he drowned.
Oh.
For a long time we didn't understand anything anyone would say.
You must have come from some other country.
But we won't know all the truth until we get to the mountains above Stony Creek.
- Like it shows on the map.
- Witch Mountain.
My brother Hiram mentioned that place to me in his letters.
He said some strangers came and settled there, kept pretty much to themselves, and nobody ever knew where they came from.
You think they might be your people?
They must be!
Security? Have you notified Mr. Bolt of our destination?
Then do so.
We've just received communication from Mr. Deranian, sir.
He's on his way to a Mr. Hiram O'Day's cabin in the hills north of Longview.
- Don't just sit here, get going!
- Yes, sir.
Well, when Hiram gets home he's gonna find his cupboard is bare.
Gotta get going.
Come on, camper's out in back.
Tia!
Can you hear me?
We need another favor.
- Tia, come on.
- Come on, Tia.
There's no way we can get by them without their seeing us.
I remember more.
It wasn't just Uncle Bene who died in the ocean when our ship went down, a lot of other people died too.
And those people, the people that live here in these mountains, well, all of us came from the same country, but on different ships.
Why then now, you mean yours sank, and the others made it to port?
But, Tony, it wasn't a country.
It was a place.
Yeah, a place that isn't there anymore.
Castaways?
That's why my people called themselves that, and...
And this was the emblem for where we used to live.
Two stars?
I don't know no place named that.
It wasn't called that.
No. Two stars...
Because our world had two suns!
- Double stars!
- Another planet!
A whole other solar system!
Well, then... It wasn't a boat.
It was a spaceship!
Our planet was dying.
The only industry left was the manufacturing of spaceships.
Like ours.
And we had to find another planet to live on.
Then the other ships in your cluster landed here in these mountains, and yours didn't make it.
I think we might have been the only ones on our spaceship to have survived.
We lost them again.
We're going to go south on highway
211. Why don't you search the north?
Not too many people around, are there?
"Misty Valley Cooperative." This is it.
Maybe they've gone out to lunch.
We'll wait.
Are you the Longview bunch chasing after those two witch kids?
That's right, mister.
My name's Cort. You the guy's putting up the reward or what?
Yes, that's right.
Except that it's now $5,000.
- Five thousand, huh?
- But there's a catch.
I want those two children alive. I don't care what happens to the old man.
They were last seen in a camper headed this way.
Those words got a mighty good sound, friend.
Any idea where to look for them?
Well, they're not around here.
That's for sure.
Maybe the next town up the line.
Stony Creek?
Stony Creek?
We're changing course now.
They sure had time enough for a lunch break.
There's something to do with the phone book.
Let me have another look at that map.
Misty Valley Cooperative.
I was calling the Castaway family and I was wondering if...
It's all right.
Were you looking for Mr. Castaway?
Yes!
Watch it! Here comes Deranian!
- Is this Tony?
- Yes.
- Is Tia with you?
- Yes. Who is this?
Thank the blessed stars!
We've been searching for you for years.
Now listen carefully.
Everything must time out.
Take the back door and go to Mr. O'Day's camper.
Children, we want to make sure
Mr. Deranian doesn't lose you.
We have a plan that should discourage them from ever pursuing you again.
Come on! Come on!
Everything's all right, Jason.
You've got a funny idea of what's "all right."
Maybe Bolt can spot the RV from the helicopter.
Hey, men, come on!
We've got a fix on them, sir.
Robertson Canyon. Headed north.
There's no way he can lose us in that monster he's driving.
Close in on them.
He's not exactly crawling.
They're getting closer, Tony.
Good driving, Al.
- How'd we wind up here?
- Another fine mess you...
- Come on, let's get out...
- Look out. The door!
Guys, let's go.
Very ingenious, Tony.
But don't forget, we want Deranian to see what's coming up.
I don't understand, sir.
Well, we have something planned that will convince Deranian and Bolt that you're both out of their reach forever.
Deranian, listen to me.
I spotted a route that lets you cut in ahead of them.
It's the second turn on the left.
Now signal the others not to follow you.
Repeat. Not.
Understood.
I don't believe it.
- It's what you call levitation.
- That ain't what I call it.
You two got powers beyond belief.
We're not doing this.
This is something too powerful for us to do.
Somebody else is making this happen.
Whoee!
That thing's flying upside down.
That's impossible.
That kind of vehicle can't fly upside down.
It's not supposed to fly at all.
They're not upside down. We are.
The voice says we should get out here and wait.
We'll never forget you, Jason.
Would you take care of Winkie?
Oh, no. Winkie's your cat.
It wouldn't be right for her to be with anybody else.
It would make us happy.
It sure would.
And I think Winkie would like it too.
Maybe we ought to ask Winkie how she feels about that.
Winkie, how do you feel about going around now with a crusty old man?
Look, if you don't mind...
I'd like to plan on, uh, remembering you two as if you were my kids.
The kids I never had.
Uncle Bene! Uncle Bene!
Uncle Bene!
Oh, you all did so well.
Congratulations, Jason O'Day.
You're a man of courage and compassion.
Uncle Bene, we thought you'd drowned.
Well, now if you know exactly what to say to a shark, he can be very accommodating.
Ah, Tia.
You never forgot.
You didn't lose the star case.
We only found the map a few days ago.
Well, I knew when you were old enough to understand it, you'd find it.
It's good to know that there are
Earth men such as you, Mr. O'Day.
If the stars are willing, perhaps some of the other children who survived will find men equally as kind.
- There are more?
- Yes.
All with star cases and maps.
So far, only Tia and Tony have found the way.
Well, now that I know what to keep my eyes peeled for, perhaps I could spot these surviving kids and bring them here.
Deranian's car.
I'll have to tend to Bolt's helicopter.
Stay and watch.
You'll see how we came into this world of yours.
What!
Stop this thing!
I'm all right! Where are the children?
I should've known there was more than ESP with those two.
Well, they're home now.
TOHO COMPANY, LTD.
A KATSU PRODUCTION
Hey, look.
The shogunate treasury.
It's filled with gold pieces, big and small.
Maybe that's why carp grow so big here.
Lots of them are two to three feet long.
Let's get some to eat with our drinks.
It'll give us lots of stamina.
Then I'd like to go to Yoshiwara -
And make courtesans weep with joy.
"I'm so glad you came."
- Wait up!
- Let go!
A woman ghost?
Interesting. Take me there.
To see the ghost?
Please, don't make us go back.
What did she look like?
- Her face was like -
- Yeah, her face -
I want to make love to a ghost once.
To a ghost?
Are you serious?
A man would like it once.
Do you mean it?
A ghost would have a cold body.
I bet it'll be pretty tight down there.
You think he's losing his mind?
A ghost has no legs.
How can he make love to one?
She'll grow legs after seeing that giant tool of his.
But a ghost has no lower part.
- A ghost can't make love.
- You're right.
Even if he has a huge tool, it's no use.
The lights!
Funny-looking face.
Worth making love to.
Submit to the law.
Where are you going, Master?
Master!
Pull them up.
Why are these bamboos so heavy?
Like iron or lead balls.
Show me your face.
Open your legs.
Let me see.
A ghost, but nothing's missing.
Take her.
Take out the bamboo poles.
You hit the jackpot, Master!
Why were they there?
Brand new gold pieces.
- You're right!
- Where'd they come from?
Edo Castle treasury.
What?
Even if you manage to steal them, it's impossible to get them out of the castle.
There are many guards.
I see. A smart idea.
Who stole them?
I don't know.
The ghost knows.
This ghost?
The thief wants the bamboos, but is afraid of prying eyes.
And men like you go near them.
So a ghost was used to scare them away.
I see.
Who made you become a ghost?
I'll see what a ghost tastes like.
Get ready!

- Please.
- Like this?
Who told you to become a ghost?
Tell me.
That's -
You won't?
I'll stop, then.
Please don't stop.
Continue.
I see.
Confess, then.
My... husband.
What does he do?
His duty is... to guard the treasury.
Treasury official?
His name?
What's his name?
She couldn't have picked a better moment.
Put her down.
It's all done.
Master.
Who are you?
Hanzo Itami,
I'm Chozaburo Kato, guarding the shogunate treasury.
Why kill her?
A samurai's wife, raped by you.
As her husband, I punished her.
If she'd lived a little longer, she would've confessed everything.
Stealing the gold you guard.
Impudence!
Submit to the law!
We treasury guards are petty officials.
We're paid very little.
So what?
As it is, we'll starve to death.
To live, we must steal.
Samurai are samurai until they die.
They don't steal even if they starve to death.
You're not real samurai.
Devoid of a samurai's mercy.
I'll kill you!
Whose idea was it to use the bamboo?
Not you petty samurai.
Who's the mastermind?
No one.
We were at our wits' end.
Enough. Kill him!
We can't let you live!
I can't kill you.
Kill him!
Who's the mastermind?
Confess.
Not going to tell me?
Then -
Hanzo, I'll tell you.
It's -
Hanzo, the elder's waiting.
Be prepared.
NORTH MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE
I, Onishi, chief officer, have brought Hanzo Itami.
Bow.
This is Elder Hotta and North Magistrate Yabe.
Bow.
The elder controls shogunate government policies.
He's far higher in rank than us.
- Bow.
- Don't be so formal.
Hanzo Itami, you killed treasury thieves.
And recovered the money.
Accept your reward.
It is a great honor for me also, his superior officer.
The reward money.
Accept it and thank them.
I can't accept it.
Fool. Don't waste this.
Why aren't you satisfied?
Samurai in low positions can't make ends meet.
They stole out of dire necessity.
It was merciless of me to kill them.
So I can't accept it.
Samurai who steal are beasts.
You did right.
It'll affect the government if all become beasts.
Hold your tongue, petty officer.
The first shogun opened the Edo Shogunate 250 years ago.
Samurai studied the martial arts,
Confucius and Mencius.
They should continue to do so.
Money is in the hands of merchants.
Prices are shooting up.
They can't survive like in the old days.
There you go again.
You've just been rewarded, remember?
Poverty cannot demean samurai.
Samurai have become too extravagant nowadays.
Samurai should be frugal.
What are you doing to your superior? Let go.
Where are you going with the money?
Returning it.
Don't make me laugh.
Are you one to return it?
Nonsense!
You - Hanzo!
Brand new pieces of gold, too.
Hand it over so I can return it.
- What's this?
- You don't need to.
I'm indebted to you, so take the money.
All for me?
I'll keep one.
Wait. Are you serious?
Really? This will help me a lot.
Don't tell anyone.
It's our secret, understand?
Wait, wait. It's a promise.
You've got your good points.
Great.
My lord!
Please hear my last wish.
Please read this.
I have no intention of listening to you.
Begone.
- My lord!
- Insolence!
Stay away from me!
I'm forbidden entrance now, but I was the lord's doctor for a long time.
I risked my life to appeal to him.
Don't stop me.
Lord, Japan is headed for extinction.
We must adopt Western ways as soon as possible and use cars and ships with steam engines.
- Looms will enrich our land.
- Nonsense!
Japan should stay with her old customs.
But... can we fight cannons with swords and spears?
We'll lose and become a colony ruled by foreigners.
Be silent!
How dare you read forbidden books and defame the government.
Arrest him.
I, Onishi, am here.
Arrest him.
Make it your merit.
What are you thinking?
Hey, are you sick?
Doctors neglect their own health.
Are the Western ways you talk about so wonderful?
Even if I'm not executed,
I'll only live a month.
I'm prepared to die.
Only a month?
I regret it that
I couldn't persuade him.
I'm a criminal under arrest.
You're an officer.
Why are you hiding me?
You'll only live a month?
I was the elder's doctor.
There's no mistake.
How do foreign cannons differ from ours?
I n power of destruction.
Ours only fire bullets.
Cannonballs explode, blasting everything within four kilometers.
- They don't miss their target.
- I get it.
And you -
Can you make one?
Yes, but I don't have any copper.
Don't worry.
I'll take care of that.
It's best to show stupid men the real thing.
This is your room starting tonight.
What is it?
Thank you.
This is no joke hiding a criminal.
What's the idea?
And that cough of his.
It's bad, very bad.
I know what it is.
What?
The master's tired of women.
He wouldn't.
Not while he has us.
Master!
- Snake is coming!
- Awfully mad!
Hanzo!
Are you in?
Hanzo! What did you do with the rebel doctor?
He's not in prison!
What is it with your attitude?
This is no time to ignore your superior.
The truth is, on the way there,
I wasn't alert enough... and he got away.
What? He escaped?
The elder ordered his arrest.
You think you can get away with that excuse?
What about my position!
Hara-kiri.
Hara-kiri?
Fool, fool, fool!
I just received orders to see the elder.
You go too.
Die in his presence.
I won't die.
I'm way above you in rank.
I won't. You do it, understand?
HOTTA
Say, Snake.
Remember where you are.
Who are these men?
What? Don't you know?
That's why I asked.
I'll tell you. They want jobs.
The one the elder speaks to will succeed.
Mend your ways or you'll join them.
I, Onishi, am here at the elder's orders.
Is today the day you study the koto?
A suitable pursuit for my wife.
Study and become good at it.
I shall obey your wishes.
Onishi.
Hanzo let Genan Sugino escape?
As chief officer, what will you do?
Yes, sir -
I'm sorry.
I promise to arrest or kill him in a month.
Certain?
If I fail,
I will commit hara-kiri with Chief Officer Onishi.
Fool! Don't talk too much!
I, Onishi, will make him commit hara-kiri!
I'd order you to die at once, but you recovered treasury money.
I'll wait a month.
The lord's departing!
You've made a habit of this.
I'm Shuzen Matsuzaka.
I'm Denkuro Mukai.
I am Kyonosuke Murao.
I'm Genta Torii.
Please accept this rare
bizen kanemitsu.
A bizen kanemitsu?
It's a famous sword.
What do you wish to be?
A chief guard, my lord.
I see.
You'll be informed about it soon.
I am honored.
I'm Sukezaburo Nakagawa
I'm Kenzaburo Matsuda
I am Kazunoshin Hirota.
Wait, wait.
Heisuke Takei, haven't decided yet?
What, my lord?
About the Nagato Aoe spear, your heirloom.
I've asked for it often.
That is a family treasure.
I cannot give it away, even to an elder.
If you offer it to me,
I'll grant your wish to be in charge of the horses.
Think it over.
Go.
Say, Heisuke.
Hanzo?
It's been some time.
- You're well?
- Well, yes.
I missed you.
How many years has it been?
Stop the palanquin.
Your voice -
You're Heisuke Takei?
Priest Kengyo Ishiyama.
Teaching Lady Hotta the koto today?
What I lent you.
The day to return it is drawing near.
Yes, I know.
I'll return it on the day it's due.
That's fine.
That red hilt. Who's he?
Bansaku Tonami, I think.
Kengyo's bodyguard.
Come home with me.
I'll treat you to a drink.
Master.
Wait a minute.
Check up on Kengyo Ishiyama and his bodyguard Bansaku Tonami.
Don't bungle it.
Let's go.
Only a spear.
Why not give it to him and succeed?
Nonsense. I'm a samurai too.
I won't use my family treasure as a bribe.
Why hang on to it?
You were always bad at swordplay, even as a child.
I still have that lump you gave me in school.
You were good in studies, though.
If you keep taking these side jobs at home, what good's your schooling?
If I sit in front of the elder's entrance, he'll notice me one day.
I'll do it for years.
I n rain or wind?
See how it gleams.
The famous purplish one by Nagato Aoe.
An exemplary spear.
Holding it excites my samurai blood.
Samurai?
Let's drink.
Buy more if it isn't enough.
Don't worry about money.
Look.
It's a real gold piece.
How'd you get it?
This work pays so much?
Are you suspicious of me?
It's honest money.
Kengyo lent it to me.
I pay interest.
Can you return it?
Money's always changing hands.
Don't worry. Drink.
Don't make it taste bad.
Come on, drink.
Hey, you'll catch a cold.
Drink up. Drink up.
You can't hold your liquor anymore, can you?
I brought you something.
Take it easy.
Don't collapse halfway through.
It's my obsession.
If my body died, my soul would finish it.
Master.
Master.
Kengyo's a big shot.
Lives in a mansion and has millions of ryo.
Dozens of samurai guard the money.
The leader's Tonami, the Red Hilt.
He used to run a fencing school.
He's awfully strong.
What Kengyo does is charges titled ladies exorbitant fees for koto lessons.
He invites them three times a month to his Plum Mansion.
The plum has five petals, so the dates are set on the 5th, 15th and 25th.
They have wild parties.
Lady Hotta, they say, goes every time.
What's today?
The 15th.
Good. Let's go.
No, Kengyo's too great.
A blind man of the highest rank.
The highest of the 73 ranks.
Exalted, he's under the temple magistrate.
Beyond our jurisdiction.
We'd be punished for this, wouldn't we?
We'd better not.
Let's not go.
Roll up your sleeves.
Who provides your three meals a day?
You'll be back in jail if I say anything.
The elder's wife?
Please enter.
Entering from the rear?
Hope we get in safely.
Good evening.
Who are you?
We're from the sake shop.
Master Takei sent us here.
Takei? That poor samurai?
He said to deliver this sake cask.
An offering? The fool.
Where shall we take it?
The storehouse.
I n there.
Boy, am I surprised.
Stocked full.
Rice, miso paste, soy sauce, charcoal -
It's more than we could eat in a lifetime
Never saw such a wonderful -
What are you doing? Hurry.
Yes, at once.
All copper tiles.
Cost a fortune.
Fill it up. More.
- Drink it down.
- Drink it all at once.
- Drink it.
- Now.
Splendid.
You've gotten stronger.
Nothing's more pleasant than practicing here.
The usual formalities are forgotten.
It's like a dream.
If I say it's the day to practice at Kengyo's, he says to practice more.
But that would be the end of me.
No, no.
You are young ladies, all just a little past 30.
As common folks say, in the prime of womanhood.
It is difficult to ask you to stifle your natural desires.
You understand women.
Who decided to call women loose for sharing our husband's bed after 30?
Yet the men have as many young girls as they like.
Heirs are important to the samurai.
So they choose young girls to bear them more children.
Everything is ready, it seems.
Bansaku, collect the money due to me without fail tonight.
The treasury guards I'd rounded up were all killed.
I must rack my brains again.
That officer must die.
I'll do it soon.
Collect tonight's money first.
I know a better way to spend treasury money.
Meaning?
Never mind.
Leave the thinking to me.
You use your arm.
That hurts!
What're you doing?
It hurts.
Treat me more tenderly.
Who are you?
Shut up!
Hanzo Itami of the north magistrate's office.
Remember me?
It won't fade.
Branded with plum petals for life.
If I tell your husbands, what will happen?
It won't end in torture or divorce.
You'll be beheaded.
Or you want to report me?
Lady Yumi.
What'll we do?
Answer me.
Hanzo, is it?
Hanzo.
We'll never do such a shameful thing again.
Please forgive us tonight.
Very well.
I will.
But...
I'll be asking you a favor, too.
Listen when I ask you for it.
Hey, handsome.
Say one word about me,
I'll tell their husbands and have you all killed.
Excuse me.
Return the money!
Return the money you owe!
What's the matter, coward?
We can't leave until you pay the money!
Return the money!
You coward samurai.
Return the money.
You want the blind to die?
Do you know the hate of blind men?
It'll haunt you for seven generations.
Get him!
Coward!
Afraid to come out?
Come out, coward!
Be quiet or you'll be sorry!
Return the money, then.
We came in Kengyo Ishiyama's place to collect his money.
Pay us now.
The contract says so.
Wait. Wait a little while.
If I'm hired, I'll return it.
Hear that?
He'll return it all.
Can't wait for you to succeed.
Pay it now.
What are you doing?
Hey, he's not paying.
Pay it! Pay it!
Quiet!
It's no use fussing.
I have no money.
You have a spear.
What? A spear?
Yes, a spear made by Nagato Aoe.
It's worth 500 ryo.
I n exchange for this contract.
Fools.
I won't even give it up for the elder.
The treasure is my soul.
You can't have it.
- The spear. Hand it over.
- Give us the Nagato Aoe spear.
Hand it over. Hand it over.
Everyone, look at this samurai.
Shut up, blind men!
Go home or I'll kill you.
- Pay the money.
- Quiet!
Wait.
Calling them blind men and killing them are cruel.
I won't permit it.
There you are, bodyguard.
You still want to live even as a usurer's dog?
Calling me names now?
Hand over the spear and I'll spare your life.
Try to get it.
Your head will roll.
Get out of here!
I'm taking it.
Touch it and I'll kill you.
Try it.
Take precautions against fires.
Heisuke.
The spear's gone.
Beautiful music.
I'm almost envious.
Compared to your beauty, my koto music is far inferior.
Would you play some more?
Yes.
If it will cheer you up,
I'll play as much as you want.
My lord is coming.
Something?
It is about time my lord came.
I wanted to see your plum tattoo.
It's too good to bear.
If it pleases you... nothing could make me happier.
Entrance of our lord.
Thank you for visiting my wife.
Hearing your koto music,
I am sure Yumi will become well.
I am honored.
Her face seems brighter than when I saw her this morning.
Yes, I really felt as if I were drunk.
I am sure you did.
I came to visit Lady Hotta today, but there is one more thing.
I brought you something.
I hope it will make you happy.
What is it?
This is the Nagato Aoe spear.
I heard you were interested in it,
I took steps and finally got it.
The spear I've dreamed about for so long.
Superb.
Kengyo, are you after something?
No, no, not at all.
But if you will give me your permission -
Speak up.
Speak up, I say.
Will you lend us blind men the shogunate gold in the treasury?
Impossible.
Those are the shogun's war funds.
What is it?
It is nothing.
No, I'll only borrow it a month.
If I lend 10,000 ryo to shogunate vassals,
13,000 ryo will return with interest.
But -
I will return the 10,000 ryo.
Please accept 2,000 ryo of the interest.
I'll take the remaining 1,000 ryo.
Money lying in the treasury is no use to us.
It will make a great amount if we just move it a little, the lives of the vassals will become easier and you will also have more money, truly killing three birds with one stone.
A good idea, my lord?
Yes.
The government must help the needy.
All right.
Shall I break the government code to help society and the people?
Open up!
Officer Itami of the North Magistrate's Office.
Quiet!
We're under the jurisdiction of the shrine magistrate.
This is no place for you.
I came to borrow real money.
Not 200 or 300 ryo.
Tell Kengyo.
You're Hanzo?
You want to borrow money from me, but an officer can't return it.
It's safer not to borrow it.
You'd have to hang yourself.
That's not your concern.
I've brought family treasures as collateral.
To you, they're worth thousands of ryo.
What treasures?
Spears.
Not one or two either.
Take them out.
How about that sound?
Sound nice?
Spears filled with treasury money.
A lot here, too.
What? I know nothing about that.
Wait.
You lead on the treasury guards and made them steal money.
If I report this, you'll be beheaded.
Nonsense.
Now that I know, there's no use making a fuss.
Where's the money?
You lent money to Heisuke and to elders.
I even got a hold of one.
With all this proof, you can't get away.
Living up to your name Razor Hanzo, you found out.
But I've been expecting you too.
You can't get out of here alive.
Kill him.
You had Heisuke killed.
I'd like to kill you.
I'll spare your life, so bring it out.
I will, I will.
Say, someone.
Bring the money
Officer Hanzo needs.
I don't want money today.
I'll help myself to all the copper tiles on the roof.
Copper tiles?
Please do. Please do.
One more thing.
Burn all the contracts of the poor samurai.
If you collect a penny, you'll answer to me.
That's too -
Do you know how harsh the penalty is for stealing treasury funds?
I can tell the temple magistrate and have you executed.
I understand.
I won't collect the money I lent.
Good.
Hold on.
There's one more thing.
I'm a poor samurai without a penny to my name.
I'll be coming to ask for things, so don't be stingy when I do.
Anything you wish.
Devil-fire. Viper.
The tiles.
We'll melt them and see.
Copper tiles?
Thank you.
I'll start at once.
Here? I n this house?
Starting tonight, we're blacksmiths.
- What about our neighbors?
- Idiot!
Tell them I'm poor, so I'm starting side work.
Get powder from the fireworks shop.
Raise your face, Officer Itami.
The traitor doctor you let escape.
Have you arrested Genan Sugino?
Not yet.
Did you hear that? Not yet?
You promised to arrest him in a month.
I remember.
You do?
You say you remember?
That's tomorrow.
I hear you just stay at home when you should be out looking for him.
Yes.
- You see? He's like this.
- Hanzo.
The elder told me to have you report to his residence tomorrow.
What will you do about it?
I'll do as I'm told to.
It's hara-kiri for you.
Are you prepared?
Who told you to relax?
Your time to die has come.
Your proudest part will become ashes as well.
I'll pick up your bones.
- Snake.
- What did you say?
- Snake.
- Don't say that!
Snake Magobei.
When I die, I'll take you with me.
- What, why?
- Past favors are soon forgotten, huh?
What's that?
You took the money the elder gave me.
Wait, we promised.
- You took the money -
- Not so loud.
Wait. Wait. I understand.
Escape tonight.
I'll take care of the rest.
Escape? Why should I?
- You took all my money!
- Wait! I understand!
I was wrong. I apologize.
What I said was wrong.
Right, Hanzo?
Hey, Bro.
Are we really taking this thing out?
I didn't think it could be made.
Why did we do this?
Shoot it and it's the end of all Edo.
He doesn't need this.
Got a big cannon himself.
Man's life-span is only 50 years.
It's food for thought.
We're going out.
Master.
You've been good to me a long time.
If we have to carry this thing, we'd rather -
Roll up your sleeve.
Who feeds you as free men?
If I say anything -
- Send us into exile.
- Please.
This is too crazy.
It's not too late. Quit now.
All right.
Going back to the penal island?
That's fine too.
You've been a great help.
Thanks a lot.
Take care of yourselves when you're back on the island.
You've done really well.
Onishi.
I ordered Hanzo Itami to come.
I don't see him. Why?
I think he escaped at night.
I'm relieved -
What?
No, an impertinent wretch!
I'll arrest him and cut off his head!
Magistrate officials are all cowards.
I'm speechless.
Kondo.
Take the Nagato Aoe spear.
The lord's departing!
Hold it.
Who's blocking the way?
I'm Genan Sugino.
A fugitive.
This is the cannon I made secretly.
I wish the elder to see how powerful it is.
Please watch carefully.
Kill him.
Are you going to leave me here?
Don't run! Somebody -
Wait! Stop!
Wait, Genan!
Don't shoot!
My lord.
This is the power of a foreign cannon.
Do you understand now?
How is it?
Rebel Genan Sugino.
I'm Officer Hanzo.
I'll kill you.
I kept my promise and killed Genan when the month was up.
Hanzo!
Good for you. You killed Genan.
I'm proud as your superior.
That's -
The spear is my reward.
No, not that!
You've no right to it.
It belonged to Heisuke Takei.
Hanzo, bow. Bow.
Shut up!
Refuse, and I'll tell all of Edo and the shogun of your evil deeds.
What did I do?
You joined Kengyo, lent out shogunate funds to pocket the gains.
I've checked.
When did you become the boss of usurers?
You understand?
A smart elder.
Snake.
Glad we weren't fired?
All ready.
HEISUKE TAKEI
You're the one who killed Heisuke Takei.
I'll kill you today.
Heisuke.
Your spear avenged you.
THE END
Did you hear that?
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.
This is madness.
We're doomed.
There'll be no escape for the princess this time.
What's that?
R2-D2, where are you?
At last.
Where have you been?
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines or smashed into who knows what.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.
Where are those transmissions you intercepted?
What have you done with those plans?
We intercepted no transmissions.
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.
If this is a consular ship, where is the ambassador?
Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans!
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!
There's one.
Set for stun.
She'll be all right.
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.
You'll be deactivated for sure.
Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease.
Come out, before somebody sees you.
Secret mission? What plans?
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.
I'm going to regret this.
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life forms.
It must have short-circuited.
That's funny. The damage doesn't look as bad from out here.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
- You've attacked a diplomatic--
- Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.
You weren't on any mercy mission this time.
Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.
I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.
You are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor.
Take her away!
Holding her is dangerous.
If word gets out... it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.
I have traced the rebel spies to her.
Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.
She'll die before she'll tell you anything.
Leave that to me.
Send a distress signal, and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed.
Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship... and no transmissions were made.
An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.
She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.
There'll be no one to stop us this time.
Yes, sir.
How did we get into this mess?
I really don't know how.
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.
What a desolate place this is.
Where do you think you're going?
Well, I'm not going that way.
It's much too rocky.
This way is much easier.
What makes you think there are settlements over there?
Don't get technical with me.
What mission?
What are you talking about?
I've just about had enough of you.
Go that way.
You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile.
And don't let me catch you following me, begging for help... because you won't get it.
No more adventures.
I'm not going that way.
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.
He tricked me into going this way... but he'll do no better.
Wait. What's that?
A transport. I'm saved.
Over here!
Hey!
Hey!
Help! Please help!
R2?
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.
Look, sir. Droids.
We stopped.
Wake up. Wake up!
We're doomed.
Do you think they'll melt us down?
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
Will this never end?
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!
Luke!
Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator, be sure it speaks Bocce.
Doesn't look like we have much choice, but I'll remind him.
Yeah, we'll take that red one.
No, not that one.
I suppose you're programmed for etiquette and protocol.
Protocol? It's my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs--
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed--
I need a droid who understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.
Vaporators? Sir, my first job was programming binary load lifters... very similar to your vaporators in most respects. very similar to your vaporators in most respects.
-Can you speak Bocce?
-Of course. It's like a second language.
-All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
-Shutting up, sir.
Take these two to the garage.
I want them cleaned up before dinner.
But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters.
You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.
Now come on.
Get to it.
All right. Come on.
And the red one.
Come on.
Come on, red. Let's go.
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition, a real bargain.
Uncle Owen, what about that one?
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.
- Take this away.
- You'll be pleased with that one, sir.
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.
Here he comes.
Let's go.
Don't you forget this.
Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity.
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.
I've got such a bad case of dust contamination I can barely move.
It just isn't fair.
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.
Is there anything
I might do to help?
No, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest... or teleport me off this rock.
I don't think so, sir.
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.
Not on this planet, anyway.
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.
Well, if there's a bright centre to the universe... you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
I see, sir.
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.
Just Luke.
And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.
This is my counterpart, R2-D2.
Hello.
A lot of carbon scoring here.
Looks like you've seen a lot of action.
With all we've been through, I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are... with the rebellion and all.
You know of the rebellion against the Empire?
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir.
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.
There's not much to tell.
I'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories.
Well, not at making them interesting, anyway.
Well, my little friend... you got something jammed in here real good.
Were you on a Starcruiser or--
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
What's this?
"What is what''?
He asked you a question. What is that?
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
He says it's nothing, sir, merely a malfunction.
Old data. Pay it no mind.
Who is she?
She's beautiful.
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.
A person of some importance,
I believe.
- Our captain was--
- Is there any more to this recording?
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.
You're my only hope.
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan
Kenobi, a resident of these parts... and it's a private message for him.
Frankly, I don't know what he's talking about.
Our last master was Captain Antilles.
But with all we've been through, this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?
I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan... but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.
He's kind of a strange old hermit.
I wonder who she is.
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.
He says the restraining bolt has short-circuited his recording system.
He suggests that if you remove the bolt... he might be able to play back the entire recording.
Oh, yeah. Well...
I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off.
Okay.
There you go.
Where'd she go? Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.
"What message''?
The one you've just been playing.
The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards.
Luke! Luke!
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.
Just you reconsider playing that message for him.
No, I don't think he likes you at all.
No, I don't like you either.
- That R2 unit might have been stolen.
- What makes you think that?
I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him.
He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?
I wonder if he's related to Ben.
That wizard's just a crazy old man.
Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to
Anchorhead and have its memory erased.
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.
But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?
He won't.
I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.
Your only concern is to prepare those new droids for tomorrow.
In the morning, I want them on the south ridge working on those condensers.
Yes, sir.
I think those new droids are gonna work out fine.
In fact, I was also thinking about our agreement-- about me staying on another season.
If these new droids work out, I want to apply to the academy this year.
You mean the next semester before the harvest?
Sure. There's more than enough droids.
Harvest is when I need you the most.
It's only one season more.
This year we'll make enough on the harvest to hire more hands... and then you can go to the academy next year.
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.
That's what you said when Biggs and Tank left.
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.
It means so much to him.
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.
That's what I'm afraid of.
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.
I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning.
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.
That R2 unit has always been a problem.
These astrodroids are getting quite out of hand.
Even I can't understand their logic at times.
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.
- Blast it.
- Couldn't we go after him?
It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait till morning.
Luke, I'm shutting the power down.
I'll be there in a few minutes.
Boy, am I gonna get it.
-That droid's gonna cause me trouble.
-He excels at that, sir.
Come on.
Have you seen Luke this morning?
He said he had things to do before he started today, so he left early.
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.
He better have those units in the south range repaired by midday... or there'll be hell to pay.
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.
Where do you think you're going?
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.
We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.
Don't talk to me of your mission.
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.
No. It's all right, but I think we'd better go.
What's wrong with him now?
There are several creatures approaching from the southeast.
Sandpeople. Or worse.
Come on.
Let's go have a look.
Come on.
There are two Banthas down there, but I don't see any--
Wait a second.
They're Sandpeople all right.
I can see one of them now.
Hello there.
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.
Don't worry.
He'll be all right.
Rest easy, son.
You've had a busy day.
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.
Ben? Ben Kenobi?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
The Jundland Wastes are not to be travelled lightly.
Tell me, young Luke, what brings you out this far?
This little droid.
He's searching for his former master... but I've never seen such devotion in a droid.
He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
Obi-Wan.
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.
A long time.
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.
He's not dead.
Not yet.
- You know him?
- Of course I know him.
He's me.
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan... since, oh, before you were born.
Then the droid does belong to you.
I don't seem to remember ever owning a droid.
Very interesting.
I think we better get indoors.
The Sandpeople are easily startled... but they'll soon be back-- and in greater numbers.
3PO.
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.
Can you stand? We've gotta get out of here before the Sandpeople return.
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.
There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for.
No, you're not.
What kind of talk is that?
Quickly. They're on the move.
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.
That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals.
Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.
I was once a Jedi knight, the same as your father.
I wish I'd known him.
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy... and a cunning warrior.
I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself.
And he was a good friend.
Which reminds me...
I have something here for you.
Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough... but your uncle wouldn't allow it.
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan... on some damn-fool idealistic crusade, like your father did.
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.
Go ahead.
- What is it?
- It's your father's lightsabre.
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.
An elegant weapon... for a more civilized age.
For over a thousand generations... the Jedi knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the old Republic... before the dark times... before the Empire.
How did my father die?
Ayoung Jedi named Darth Vader... who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil... helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights.
He betrayed and murdered your father.
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.
The Force?
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.
It's an energy field created by all living things.
It surrounds us and penetrates us.
It binds the galaxy together.
Let's see if we can't figure out what you are, little friend... and where you come from.
- I saw part of a message--
- I seem to have found it.
General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars.
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person.
But my ship
has fallen under attack...
and my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.
I have placed information vital
to the survival of the rebellion...
into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.
My father will know
how to retrieve it.
You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.
This is our most desperate hour.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.
You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.
Alderaan?
I'm not going to Alderaan.
I've gotta get home.
I'm in for it as it is.
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.
I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
I can't get involved.
I've got work to do.
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?
Learn about the Force, Luke.
I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
You must do what you feel is right, of course.
Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable.
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
They're more dangerous than you realize.
Dangerous to your starfleet,
Commander... not to this battle station.
The rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate--
The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
I've just received word that the emperor has dissolved the council permanently.
The last remnants of the old Republic have been swept away.
That's impossible.
How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?
The regional governors now have direct control over their territories.
Fear will keep the local systems in line.
- Fear of this battle station.
- And what of the rebellion?
If the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station... it is possible, however unlikely... that they might find a weakness and exploit it.
The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.
Any attack by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture... no matter what technical data they've obtained.
This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.
I suggest we use it.
Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.
The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant... next to the power of the Force.
Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
Your sad devotion to that ancient religion... has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes... or given you clairvoyance enough to find the rebels' hidden fortress--
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.
As you wish.
This bickering is pointless.
Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress... by the time this station is operational.
We will then crush the rebellion with one swift stroke.
It looks like the Sandpeople did this.
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.
I've just never heard of them hitting anything this big before.
They didn't, but we are meant to think they did.
These tracks are side-by-side.
Sandpeople always ride single file to hide their numbers.
These are the same Jawas that sold us R2 and 3PO.
And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople.
Only imperial stormtroopers are so precise.
But why would imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?
If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to... and that would lead them back... home.
Wait, Luke.
It's too dangerous.
Uncle Owen.
Aunt Beru.
Now, Your Highness, we will discuss the location... of your hidden rebel base.
There's nothing you could have done, had you been there.
You'd have been killed too... and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire.
I want to come with you to Alderaan.
There's nothing for me here now.
I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.
Mos Eisley spaceport.
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
We must be cautious.
How long have you had these droids?
- Three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.
Let me see your identification.
You don't need to see his identification.
We don't need to see his identification.
These aren't the droids you're looking for.
These aren't the droids we're looking for.
He can go about his business.
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.
Move along.
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.
Go on, go on.
I can't understand how we got by those troops. I thought we were dead.
The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.
You really think we're gonna find a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?
Most of the best freighter pilots are to be found here.
Only watch your step-- this place can be a little rough.
I'm ready for anything.
Come along, R2.
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?
Your droids-- they'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here.
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.
I heartily agree with you, sir.
I'll have one of those.
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead.
This little one's not worth the effort.
Come, let me get you something.
I'm all right.
Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us.
I don't like the look of this.
Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon.
Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.
Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?
Should I have?
It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs.
I've outrun imperial starships.
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.
I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now.
She's fast enough for you, old man.
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers-- myself, the boy, two droids... and no questions asked.
Is it some kind of local trouble?
Let's just say we'd like to avoid any imperial entanglements.
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?
And it's gonna cost you something extra.
10,000, all in advance.
We could almost buy our own ship for that.
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot.
We don't have to sit here and listen--
We can pay you 2,000 now... plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.
Seventeen?
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.
Ninety-four.
Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork.
All right. We'll check it out.
17,000. Those guys must really be desperate.
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.
I'm never coming back to this planet again.
Going somewhere, Solo?
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.
Tell Jabba that
I've got his money.
It's too late.
You should have paid him when you had the chance.
Jabba's put a price on your head so large... every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you.
I'm lucky I found you first.
Yeah, but this time
I've got the money.
If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.
I don't have it with me.
Tell Jabba--
Jabba's through with you.
He has no time for smugglers... who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.
Over my dead body.
That's the idea.
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.
I'll bet you have.
Sorry about the mess.
Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable.
It'll be some time before we can extract any information from her.
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.
What course shall we set?
Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion.
What do you mean?
I think it is time we demonstrated the full power of this station.
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.
Lock the door, R2.
Check this side of the street.
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.
I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.
I don't know what this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.
Watch your language.
All right. Give it to me.
I'll take it.
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38 came out, they just aren't in demand.
It'll be enough.
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!
Right here,Jabba.
I've been waitin' for you.
Have you now.
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.
Why haven't you paid me... and why did you fry poor Greedo?
Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me, come yourself. Don't send these twerps.
Han, I can't make exceptions.
What if everyone who smuggled for me... dropped their cargo at the first sign... of an imperial starship?
It's not good business.
Look,Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.
You think I had a choice?
But I got a nice, easy charter.
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.
Han, my boy, you're the best.
So, for an extra 20% --
Fifteen,Jabba.
Don't push it.
Okay, 15% .
But if you fail me again...
I'll put a price on your head so big... you won't be able to go near a civilized system.
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.
Come on!
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.
What a piece of junk.
She'll make .5 past light speed.
She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid.
I've made a lot of special modifications myself.
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll just get on board, we'll get outta here.
Hello, sir.
Which way?
All right, men, load your weapons.
Stop that ship.
Blast them.
Chewie, get us out of here!
Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.
Looks like an imperial cruiser. Our passengers are hotter than I thought.
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields... while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.
Stay sharp. There's two more comin'.
They're gonna try and cut us off.
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought this thing was fast.
Watch your mouth, or you're gonna find yourself floating home.
We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.
Besides, I know a few manoeuvres.
We'll lose 'em.
Here's where the fun begins.
How long before you can jump to light speed?
It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer.
At the rate they're gaining?
Travelling through hyperspace ain't like dustin' crops, boy.
Without precise calculations... we'd fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova... and that would end your trip real quick.
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.
We've entered the Alderaan system.
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash.
I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board.
Charming to the last.
You don't know how hard I found it... signing the order to terminate your life.
I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.
Princess Leia, before your execution...
I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony... that will make this battle station operational.
No star system will dare oppose the emperor now.
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin... the more star systems will slip through your fingers.
Not after we demonstrate the power of this station.
In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet... that'll be destroyed first.
Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base...
I have chosen to test this station's destructive power... on your home planet of Alderaan.
No. Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons.
You would prefer another target?
A military target?
Then name the system.
I grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time.
Where is the rebel base?
Dantooine.
They're on Dantooine.
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.
- What?
- You're far too trusting.
Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration.
But don't worry. We will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.
Commence primary ignition.
Are you all right?
What's wrong?
I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror... and were suddenly silenced.
I fear something terrible has happened.
You'd better get on with your exercises.
You can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs.
I told you I'd outrun them.
Don't everybody thank me at once.
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about 0200 hours.
Now be careful, R2.
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.
But, sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.
'Cause a droid don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose.
Wookiees are known to do that.
I see your point, sir.
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.
But it also obeys your commands.
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a blaster at your side.
You don't believe in the Force, do you?
Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.
I've seen a lot of strange stuff... but I've never seen anything to make me believe... there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.
There's no mystical energy field controls my destiny.
It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
I suggest you try it again, Luke.
This time, let go your conscious self... and act on instinct.
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.
Stretch out with your feelings.
You see? You can do it.
I call it luck.
In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.
Good against remotes is one thing.
Good against the living, that's something else.
We're coming up on Alderaan.
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.
That's good. You've taken your first step into a larger world.
Yes?
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.
They found the remains of a rebel base... but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time.
They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
She lied.
She lied to us.
I told you she would never consciously betray the rebellion.
Terminate her immediately.
Stand by, Chewie.
Cut in the sublight engines.
What the--
We've come out in a meteor shower, some kind of asteroid collision.
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?
Our position's correct, except no Alderaan.
- Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It ain't there.
It's been blown away.
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet.
It'd take a thousand ships with more firepower than I've--
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.
It's an imperial fighter.
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.
There aren't any bases here.
Where did it come from?
Sure is leaving in a hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.
A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.
He must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.
He ain't gonna be around long enough to tell anybody about us.
He's heading for that small moon.
I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.
That's no moon.
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.
I have a very bad feeling about this.
Turn the ship around.
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.
Why are we still moving towards it?
A tractor beam's pulling us in.
There's gotta be something you can do.
There's nothing I can do.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.
They're not gonna get me without a fight.
You can't win, but there are alternatives to fighting.
Clear Bay 327.
We are opening
the magnetic field.
To your stations.
Come with me.
Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.
Yes?
We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.
Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.
They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.
She may yet be of some use to us.
Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9.
Release charge.
316, report to control.
There's no one on board, sir.
According to the log, the crew abandoned ship right after take-off.
It must be a decoy. Several escape pods have been jettisoned.
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.
If there were any, they must have jettisoned.
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.
Yes, sir.
I sense something... a presence I've not felt since--
Get me a scanning crew in here.
I want every part of this ship checked.
There's no one here.
Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.
I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.
This is ridiculous.
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.
Leave that to me.
Damn fool.
I knew you were gonna say that.
Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?
The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately.
Let's go.
Hey, down there.
Could you give us a hand with this?
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?
TK-421, do you copy?
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.
Between his howling and your blasting everything... it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight to sneakin' around.
We've found the computer outlet, sir.
Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire imperial network.
He's found the controls to the power beam that's holding the ship here.
He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor.
The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations.
A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave.
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.
- I want to go with you.
- Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids.
They must be delivered safely... or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.
Your destiny lies along a different path from mine.
The Force will be with you... always.
You said it, Chewie.
Where did you dig up that old fossil?
Ben is a great man.
- Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.
Anything's better than just hangin' around waiting for 'em to pick us up.
Who do you think--
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
He says, "I've found her,'' and keeps repeating, "She's here.''
Who? Who has he found?
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?
- Princess?
- Where is she?
Princess? What's going on?
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.
I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated.
Oh, no.
We've gotta do something.
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.
You said you didn't want to just wait to be captured. Now you want to stay?
Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.
She's rich.
Rich?
Rich, powerful. If you were to rescue her, the reward would be--
- What?
- Well, more well than you can imagine.
I don't know.
I can imagine quite a bit.
- You'll get it.
- I better.
You will.
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.
- All right.
- What's your plan?
3PO, hand me those binders there, will you?
Okay.
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.
Okay, Han, you put those on.
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking... but what should R2 and I do if we're discovered here?
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.
That isn't very reassuring.
517 to scanner control.
517 to scanner control.
316, report to control.
53 to upper bay door.
53 to upper bay door.
I can't see a thing in this helmet.
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?
I did say so before.
Where are you taking this... thing?
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.
I wasn't notified.
I'll have to clear it.
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!
Look out.
We gotta find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Here it is-- 2187.
You go and get her.
I'll hold them here.
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.
What happened?
Had a slight weapons malfunction... but everything's perfectly all right now.
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.
- How are you?
- We're sending a squad up.
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.
Who is this?
What's your operating number?
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!
Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?
Oh, the uniform.
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.
- You're who?
- I'm here to rescue you.
I've got your R2 unit.
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
- Where is he?
- Come on.
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.
The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.
Surely he must be dead by now.
Don't underestimate the Force.
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.
You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.
Yes.
We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.
The princess?
Put all sections on alert.
Obi-Wan is here.
The Force is with him.
If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.
Get behind me.
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.
- Can't get out that way.
- You cut off our only escape route.
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.
- C-3PO. C-3PO.
- Yes, sir?
Are there any other ways out of the cell bay? We've been cut off.
What was that?
I didn't copy.
I said all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.
The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out.
All other information on your level is restricted.
Open up in there.
Open up in there.
Oh, no.
There isn't any other way out.
I can't hold them off forever.
Now what?
Some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?
He's the brains, sweetheart.
Well, I didn't--
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.
Into the garbage chute, fly boy.
Get in!
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.
Get in there, and don't worry about it.
Wonderful girl.
Either I'm gonna kill her, or I'm beginning to like her.
Get in there.
The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea.
What an incredible smell you've discovered.
Let's get out of here.
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.
I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!
Absolutely, Your Worship.
Look, I had everything under control till you led us down here.
It's not gonna take 'em long to figure out what happened to us.
It could be worse.
It's worse.
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.
Something just moved past my leg.
Look. Did you see that?
What?
Kid! Luke!
Grab hold of this!
Blast it! My gun's jammed.
- Where?
- Anywhere!
Help him!
- What happened?
- I don't know.
It just let go of me and disappeared.
I got a bad feeling about this.
- The walls are moving!
- Try and brace it with something.
Help me.
Wait a minute.
3PO! Come in, 3PO!
3PO!
Where could he be?
Take over. See to him.
Look, there.
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.
If you hurry, you might catch them.
Follow me.
You stand guard.
Come on.
All this excitement has overrun the circuits in my counterpart here.
If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance.
All right.
3PO. Come in, 3PO.
3PO.
- Get on top.
- I can't.
Where could he be? 3PO.
3PO, will you come in.
They aren't here.
Something must have happened.
See if they've been captured. Hurry.
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.
Thank goodness they haven't found them.
Where could they be?
"Use the comlink''? Oh, my.
I forgot.
I turned it off.
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?
- We've had some problems.
- Shut up and listen to me.
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy?
Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level!
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!
No, shut them all down.
Hurry! Oh, no.
What?
You did great, 3PO!
Listen to them.
They're dying, R2.
Curse my metal body.
I wasn't fast enough.
It's all my fault.
My poor master.
We're all right.
You did great!
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number-- Where are we?
3263827.
If we can avoid any more female advice, we oughta be able to get out of here.
Let's get moving.
Where you goin'?
Wait! They'll hear!
Come here, you big coward.
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.
I don't know who you are or where you came from... but from now on, you do as I tell you, okay?
Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight.
I take orders from just one person-- me.
It's a wonder you're still alive.
Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?
No reward is worth this.
Give me regular reports, please.
Right.
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.
You seen that new VT-16?
Yeah. Some of the other guys were telling me about it.
They say it's quite a thing to see.
What was that?
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?
Yes, sir.
- Are you safe?
- For the moment.
We're in the main hangar across from the ship.
We're right above you.
Stand by.
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.
Nice. Come on.
It's them.
Blast them.
Get back to the ship!
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.
What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on.
I think we took a wrong turn.
There's no lock.
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.
-Find the controls to extend the bridge.
-I think I just blasted it.
They're coming through.
Here, hold this.
Here they come.
For luck.
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.
Where could they be?
Where could they be?
Close the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.
The circle is now complete.
When I left you,
I was but the learner.
Now I am the master.
Only a master of evil, Darth.
Your powers are weak, old man.
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...
I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
You should not have come back.
Didn't we just leave this party?
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.
I hope the old man got the tractor beam down.
Look.
Come on, R2. We're going.
Now's our chance. Go!
Come on!
Come on!
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!
Run, Luke, run.
I hope that old man got the tractor beam down, or this is gonna be a short trip.
Hit it!
We're coming up on their sentry ships.
Hold them off. Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns.
I can't believe he's gone.
There wasn't anything you could have done.
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.
You in, kid?
Okay, stay sharp.
Here they come.
They're coming in too fast!
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.
Hear me, baby?
Hold together.
Got him. I got him!
Great, kid.
Don't get cocky.
There's still two more.
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.
Are they away?
They've just made the jump into hyperspace.
You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship?
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.
This had better work.
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.
That doesn't sound too hard.
They let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.
- You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.
Not this ship, sister.
At least the information in R2 is still intact.
What's so important?
What's he carrying?
The technical readouts of that battle station.
I only hope that when the data's analysed a weakness can be found.
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.
I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess.
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.
You needn't worry about your reward.
If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive.
Your friend is quite a mercenary.
I wonder if he really cares about anything... or anybody.
I care.
So... what do you think of her, Han?
I'm trying not to, kid.
Good.
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.
What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me--
No.
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.
We have no time for sorrows,
Commander.
You must use the information in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.
It's our only hope.
- Yes.
- We're approaching the planet Yavin.
The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.
We are preparing
to orbit the planet.
The battle station is heavily shielded... and carries a firepower greater than half the starfleet.
Its defences are designed around a direct large-scale assault.
A small, one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defence.
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub fighters against that?
The Empire doesn't consider a small, one-man fighter to be any threat... or they'd have a tighter defence.
An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia... has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.
The approach will not be easy.
You're required to manoeuvre straight down this trench... and skim the surface to this point.
The target area is only two metres wide.
It's a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port.
The shaft leads directly to the reactor system.
A precise hit will start a chain reaction... which should destroy the station.
Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.
The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
That's impossible, even for a computer.
No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-16 back home.
They're not much bigger than two metres.
Then man your ships, and may the Force be with you.
Orbiting the planet
at maximum velocity.
The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.
This will be a day long remembered.
It has seen the end of Kenobi... and will soon see the end of the rebellion.
All flight crews,
man your stations.
So, you got your reward and you're just leaving, then?
That's right. Yeah.
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here, do ya?
Why don't you come with us? You're pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.
Come on. Why don't you take a look around?
You know what's about to happen, what they're up against.
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.
What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it?
Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage.
It's more like... suicide.
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.
I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?
Hey, Luke.
May the Force be with you.
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.
All pilots to your stations.
- What's wrong?
- It's Han.
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.
I only wish Ben were here.
Open main launch tubes.
Main launch tubes opening, sir.
Hey, Luke!
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.
Are you sure you can handle this ship?
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot in the outer-rim territories.
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your stories when we get back, all right?
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.
This R2 unit of yours seems a bit beat up. You want a new one?
Not on your life. That droid and I have been through a lot.
You okay, R2?
Good.
Gold squadron,
begin take-off procedure.
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.
You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?
Luke, the Force will be with you.
Standby alert.
Death Star approaching.
Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.
- Red Seven standing by.
- Red Three standing by.
- Red Six standing by.
- Red Nine standing by.
- Red Two standing by.
- Red 11 standing by.
Red Five standing by.
Lock S-foils in attack position.
We're passing through
the magnetic field.
Hold tight.
Switch your deflectors on.
Double front.
Look at the size of that thing.
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- We're starting for the target shaft.
We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and draw their fire.
- Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
- I see it. Stay low.
This is Red Five.
I'm going in.
Luke, pull up!
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.
We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so small they're evading our turbolasers.
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.
Get the crews to their fighters.
Watch yourself.
There's a lot of fire coming from
the right side of that deflection tower.
I'm on it.
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.
I've got a problem here.
- Eject.
- I can hold it.
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right--
The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.
Luke, trust your feelings.
Squad leaders... we've picked up a new group of signals.
Enemy fighters coming your way.
My scope's negative.
I don't see anything.
- Pick up your visual scanning.
- Here they come.
You've got one on your tail.
I'm hit!
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.
He's on me tight.
I can't shake him.
I'll be right there.
Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with me.
- Fall in. Fall in.
- Watch your back, Luke.
Fighters above you, coming in.
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.
Hang on back there.
Red Six, can you see Red Five?
There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?
I can't shake him.
I'm on him, Luke.
Blast it, Biggs.
Where are you?
- Thanks, Wedge.
- Good shooting, Wedge.
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.
I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.
Stay in attack formation.
The exhaust port
is marked and locked in.
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.
Switch all power to front deflector screen.
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?
Say about 20 guns,
some on the surface, some on the towers.
Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.
Switch to targeting computer.
Computer's locked.
Getting a signal.
The guns. They've stopped.
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.
They're coming in.
Three marks at 210.
I'll take them myself.
Cover me.
Yes, sir.
- It's no good. I can't manoeuvre.
- Stay on target.
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.
Loosen up!
Gold Five to Red Leader, lost Tiree, lost Hutch.
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.
We've analysed their attack, sir, and there is a danger.
Should I have your ship standing by?
Evacuate?
In our moment of triumph?
I think you overestimate their chances.
Rebel base,
three minutes and closing.
Red boys, this is Red Leader.
Rendezvous at mark 6. 1.
- This is Red Two flying toward you.
- Red Three standing by.
Red Leader, this is Base One.
Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.
Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.
Hold up here and wait for my signal to start your run.
This is it.
We should be able to see it by now.
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?
- No sign of any-- Wait. Coming in .35.
- I see them.
I'm in range.
Target's coming up.
Just hold them off for a few seconds.
Close up formation.
Almost there.
-Let her loose. They're right behind me.
-Almost there.
I can't hold them.
It's away!
- It's a hit!
- Negative.
Negative. It didn't go in.
It just impacted on the surface.
Red Leader, we're right above you.
Turn to .05.
We'll cover for you.
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.
Get set up for your attack run.
Rebel base, one minute and closing.
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.
We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back.
Right with you, boss.
Luke, at that speed, will you be able to pull out in time?
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.
My scope shows the tower,
but I can't see the exhaust port.
Are you sure the computer can hit it?
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.
What about that tower?
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose again. See if you can't lock it down.
Fighters coming in .3.
- I'm hit. I can't stay with you.
- Get clear, Wedge.
- You can't do any more good back there.
- Sorry.
Let him go.
Stay on the leader.
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.
R2, try and increase the power.
Hurry up, Luke. Quick.
Quick.
Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.
I'm on the leader.
Hang on, R2.
Use the Force, Luke.
Let go, Luke.
The Force is strong with this one.
Luke, trust me.
His computer's off.
You switched off your
targeting computer. What's wrong?
Nothing. I'm all right.
I've lost R2.
The Death Star has cleared the planet.
The Death Star has cleared the planet.
Rebel base in range.
You may fire when ready.
Commence primary ignition.
I have you now.
What?
Look out.
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.
Stand by.
Stand by.
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!
Remember, the Force
will be with you always.
I just knew you'd come back.
I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the reward.
I knew there was more to you than money.
Oh, no.
Oh, my.
R2, can you hear me?
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.
He'll be all right.
- I'm Statler.
- I'm Waldorf.
We're here to heckle
The Muppet Movie.
Gentlemen, that's straight ahead.
Private screening room D.
- Private screening?
- Yeah, they're afraid to show it in public.
STATLER: Oh, oh. Look at this place.
What a dump.
WALDORF: Bunch of weirdos around here. Look at 'em.
- Yes, I know you all want to sit with moi.
- Hey, lady. Is this seat taken?
Hey, you! Hey! Bring that back.
I'm so nervous. If I'm not funny,
I won't be able to live with myself.
Well, then you'll have to get another apartment, won't you?
You know,
I hear this movie is dynamite.
Get your fresh organic popcorn.
Only a buck.
Honey. Buy me some, please.
Sure, Momma.
Nothin's too good for my woman.
Woman! Woman! Woman!
- Well, I like the movie fine so far.
- It hasn't started yet.
- That's what I like about it.
- (BOTH CHUCKLING)
Yie, yie, yie, yie, yie!
Do it. Yay! (LAUGHING)
Oh, hey, Mr. The Frog.
Is it okay for me and my boomerang fish to be in your movie?
Hey!
I told you, Lew.
Not in the movie or at the screening.
Hey, but watch. Whoa!
(CLEARS THROAT) Kermit, does this film have socially redeeming value?
Oh, I... I certainly hope so, Sam.
Sorry about that.
- Kermie.
- Oh, hi, Piggy.
Kermie, I tried to save you a seat, but somebody took it.
Hi, everybody, and welcome to the first screening of The Muppet Movie.
But before we begin, I'd like to thank everyone who contributed to this film, starting with the little people, from the hairdressers to special effects.
That's enough of that, Harry.
- (ALL CLAMORING)
- Boom! Blow it up. Ka-boom!
- MUPPET: Boring.
- To the costume designers.
- To the prop makers.
- MISS PIGGY: Kermie, Kermie.
Speeches are not necessary, dear.
Roll film.
Yeah, but I'd like to thank everybody for all of their hard work and their patience
- and their...
- Roll film! Roll film!
Roll film.
Excuse me.
Uncle Kermit, is this about how the Muppets really got started?
Well, it's sort of approximately how it happened.
KERMIT: (SINGING) Why are there so many songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions
But only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told
And some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
Who said that every wish
Would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it
Look what it's done so far
What's so amazing
That keeps us stargazing?
And what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic
Have you been half asleep?
And have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound
That calls the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
MAN: Help! Hello.
This is a serious call for help.
- Yeah?
- Someone help.
Ah, I... Oh, oh.
You, you with the banjo.
Can you help me?
I have lost my sense of direction.
Have you tried Hare Krishna?
Ha, ha. No.
- No. I mean I'm really lost.
- (FLY BUZZING)
One second.
Darn, I missed. You know, that's the first thing to go on a frog.
His tongue. The tongue goes and you can't catch flies.
That's rough.
I'm sorry about your tongue, but I have to get out of this swamp.
I have to catch a plane.
With that tongue? No way.
But seriously, there's a boat dock just downstream.
- Thank you.
- Just watch out for the alligators.
I will.
- Alligators?
- That's right.
Did you say alligators?
Read my lips, alligators.
It's just that I'm not used to alligators where I come from.
See, I'm an agent.
I... I winged in from Hollywood.
- Hollywood?
- That's right.
Did you say Hollywood?
Read my lips, Hollywood. You know...
Hollywood
The dream factory, the magic store.
Hey, don't you ever go to the movies?
Oh, sure. There's a double feature in town every Saturday.
- Wait a minute.
- What?
There's an ad in here that you should be very interested in.
- Feast your eyes on that.
- Uh...
"World Wide Studios announces open auditions for frogs
"wishing to become rich and famous."
Well, thanks anyway, but I'm really pretty happy where I am.
Oh, oh, if I were you,
I would give this audition very careful consideration.
You've got talent, kid.
Singin', tellin' jokes.
I mean, if you get your tongue fixed, who knows?
You could make millions of people happy.
- Millions of people happy?
- Millions.
Hey, if you ever come west to Hollywood, look me up.
Bernie the Agent.
Hey, well, listen, Bernie, why don't you say hello to Arnie the Alligator?
- What?
- Arnie.
Arnie, wait a minute. Careful, Arnie.
Stay! Stay!
Arnie, that's okay. Leave him alone.
It's all right, he's from Hollywood.
Hollywood. Gee.
I...
I'd miss this old swamp, but...
Millions of people happy.
What the...
MAN: Okay, okay, you guys.
Now, come on. Do what I tell you.
I don't know where you're...
All right, now...
Don't step on that asphalt!
I told you not to step on it.
We gotta get this... Off the asphalt!
I told you, stay off the asphalt!
Hey, look at him.
Oh, big legs.
MAN: Hey, you on the bike!
Watch out! Watch out!
- Watch out!
- Oh, my... Ah!
Watch out!
Oh!
Hmm.
That's pretty dangerous, building a road in the middle of the street.
I mean, if frogs couldn't hop,
I'd be gone with the Schwinn.
KERMIT: The El Sleezo Cafe.
Hmm.
Foreign food.
Doesn't smell promising, but a frog's gotta eat.
KERMIT: Wow.
Rough place, huh?
That's the toughest, meanest, filthiest, pesthole on the face of the Earth.
Well, why not complain to the owner?
I am the owner.
MAN: Watch out.
Hot plates comin' through. Look out.
All right, you got your French-fried frog legs on Cotton.
You got your frog legs on Eugenie.
You got your frog legs stroganoff.
- Everybody happy? All right.
- Ugh!
Hello, sailor. Buy me a drink?
Well, you see,
I'm not a sailor, I'm a frog.
Cut the small talk and buy me a drink.
- But I don't even know you.
- Hey. You makin' a move on my girl?
- No, sir.
- He did, too. He touched me.
Ugh! Go wash. You'll get warts.
- No, you see, that's just a myth.
- Yeah, but she's my "myth."
- No, no. Myth, myth.
- Yeth?
What the hey?
Showtime. Showtime at the El Sleezo.
PIANIST: And now, filling in for the vacationing El Sleezo dancing girls, the funny, furry, fabulous Fozzie Bear.
Wacka, wacka, wacka, wacka.
Hey, you're a great crowd.
Thank you, thank you and thank you.
- Hey, wacka, wacka.
- (HONKING)
Ah, wacka, wacka, wacka.
Here I am, Fozzie Bear, to tell you jokes both old and rare.
Wacka, wacka, wacka.
Ha, ha. Let's start things off with a bang.
Thank you, sir.
Wacka, wacka, wacka, wacka, wacka.
This guy's lost.
Maybe he should try Hare Krishna.
Grief, it's a running gag.
Uh...
There was this sailor who was so fat...
How fat was he?
Uh...
He was so fat that everybody liked him and there was nothing funny about him at all.
FOZZIE: No problem.
Oh, wait, please.
Oh, please. Please wait.
I'm trying so hard. Please don't do that.
I'm a professional.
I've had three performances.
- Cut, cut, please.
- Do you know any dance routines?
What? Not really. Do you?
- Play something snappy.
- You got it.
- Now dance.
- What?
- Dance.
- Yes, sir.
Ah! Wacka, wacka.
Aha, wacka, wacka.
Ah!
It's too bad the dancing girls are on vacation. The crowd is getting ugly.
Ha, ha. You think this crowd's ugly, you should see the dancing girls.
FOZZIE: Two, three, four.
- Two, three, kick.
- Kick. Yeah, sorry.
Coming home.
FOZZIE: Argh!
Please. I just cleaned the fur.
Please. Oh.
I hope you appreciate that I'm doing all my own stunts.
Wacka wacka.
Okay, everybody. Drinks on the house.
Drinks on the house!
Man, come on, let's go.
- Drinks on the house.
- Go, go. On the house.
MAN: Drinks on the house.
I don't see no drinks up here.
What's he talkin' about?
The bartender said there were drinks on the house.
Works every time.
Well... Well, hey, listen.
My name is Kermit the Frog and I'm on my way to Hollywood.
- Hollywood?
- You wanna join me?
Big-time show biz.
That's always been my dream.
Yeah, well, they're holding auditions for frogs next week.
And if they need frogs, they must need bears, too.
Oh.
My car's right outside.
Gee, a Studebaker.
Where did you get it?
- My uncle left it to me.
- Huh? Is he dead?
No, he's hibernating.
You know, Fozzie, you really do have a lot of talent.
Thank you.
You know, how about you and me putting together an act?
Oh, no. Sorry. I only work as a single.
Oh, okay.
All right. You talked me into it.
We'll be a team.
Oh, good.
- What's this?
- Hey, you better pull over here.
Yes, sir.
- (BANGING)
- FOZZIE: Ah.
Hey, what's going on?
Howdy, Mr. Frog.
- I'm a businessman with a proposition.
- What?
Let me show you somethin' that might change your whole life.
Huh.
Hop right on over here, my little green friend.
- Listen, mister.
- That's it.
This is the kind of chance you can't afford to pass up.
- (GASPS)
- No, now, don't be afraid.
- Watch the window.
- Hm.
- KERMIT: What's that?
- FOZZIE: Ah.
- (KERMIT GASPS)
- Hi, I'm Doc Hopper, invitin' you to hop on down and get some Hopper's French-fried frog legs.
Right here at the sign of the bright green legs.
- Good grief.
- Come on.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
Frog legs, frog legs, frog legs are fine
Hopper's is the place you should dine
There's cheese legs
Bacon legs, chili legs too
French-fried frog legs barbecued
Oh, Fozzie. Ugh.
If you want just a snack
Don't worry.
Then here is the one
A frog leg burger on a bright green bun
That is terrible.
That's the most appalling, disgusting, revolting thing I've ever seen.
I know. I'm a great businessman and a sweet fella, but I do lack the skills of a performer.
You also make a lousy frog.
You, on the other hand, make a terrific frog.
- What?
- He's right, you know.
- You are very likable, Kermit.
- The bear's right.
You, my little likable friend, are gonna do all our television commercials.
- No way.
- Hold it. Now, just a minute.
There's $500 in it for you up-front.
$500 is just the beginning.
You could be earning this much every year.
- Let's go, Fozzie.
Would you consider a bear in a frog suit?
- Fozzie.
- Yes, sir. I just lost my head. I...
Now, just a minute, Mr. Frog.
Everything's negotiable.
- FOZZIE: Okay, here we go, here we go.
- (BANGING)
- FOZZIE: Sorry.
- Hey, that's my Caddy!
- Just get it in gear, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
HOPPER:
Frog, it's money we're talking about.
Max!
- Follow that frog.
- (TIRES SQUEAL)
- Max!
- (BRAKES SCREECH)
Follow that frog with me in the car!
I'm sorry, Doc. I just got excited.
Hey, do you like the frog?
Isn't he terrific, Doc?
Terrific, Max, terrific. Now go!
But you promised me a reward.
Later, Max. Now follow that frog.
- FOZZIE: Oh, it's a gorgeous day.
- KERMIT: Yep, certainly is.
- Yep, terrific day for a drive.
- It's beautiful country out here.
A frog and a bear seeing America.
(SINGING) Movin' right along in search of good times and good news
With good friends, you can't lose
This could become a habit
Opportunity knocks once
Let's reach out and grab it
- Yeah!
- Together we'll nab it
We'll hitchhike, bus, or Yellow Cab it
Cab it?
BOTH: Movin' right along
Footloose and fancy-free
Getting there is half the fun
Come share it with me
Movin' right along
KERMIT: We'll learn to share the load
FOZZIE: We don't need a map to keep this show on the road
Hey, Fozzie, I want you to turn left if you come to a fork in the road.
Yes, sir. Turn left at the fork in the road.
FOZZIE: Kermit.
KERMIT: I don't believe that.
KERMIT: (SINGING) Movin' right along
We've found a life on the highway
FOZZIE: And your way is my way
KERMIT: So trust my navigation
FOZZIE: California, here we come
Come pie in the sky land
KERMIT: Palm trees and warm sand
Though sadly we just left Rhode Island
- We did what?
- Just forget it.
BOTH: Movin' right along
Hey, LA, where have you gone?
FOZZIE: Send someone to fetch us
We're in Saskatchewan
BOTH: Movin' right along
You take it, you know best
FOZZIE: Hey, I've never seen the sun come up in the west
Ah.
A bear in his natural habitat.
A Studebaker.
- Hey, Fozzie, look up ahead.
- What is that?
Maybe we should give him a ride.
I don't know. He's pretty big.
- Hey, there. Want a lift?
- Oh, no, thanks.
I'm on my way to New York City to try to break into public television.
Ah.
Good luck.
BOTH: (SINGING) Movin' right along
We're truly birds of a feather
We're in this together
And we know where we're goin'
Movie stars with flashy cars and life with the top down
We're stormin' the big town
Yeah, storm is right.
Should it be snowing?
No, I don't think so.
BOTH: Movin' right along
Footloose and fancy-free
You're ready for the big time
Is it ready for me?
Movin' right along
KERMIT: Hey.
Hey, Fozzie, look up ahead there.
There's one of those
Doc Hopper billboards.
- Maybe you'd better pull over.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, look at that.
Kermit, that's you.
You got the picture, boy?
You see what I mean?
Kermit the Frog, symbol of
Doc Hopper's French-fried frog legs.
Isn't that splendid? Just splendid.
Just take a look at it.
All I can see are millions of frogs on tiny crutches.
Now, listen, boy.
Don't you wanna be rich and famous?
- Not workin' for you, I don't.
- That's right.
- Crutches?
- Shut up, Max.
We're a small-time operation, but we're expandin'.
Expandin', just like you frogs expand.
Don't you frogs expand?
- That's a myth.
- What?
Myth! Myth!
Yeth?
BOTH: Huh?
- Come on, Bear. Burn rubber.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Frog!
That's the second time!
Max, I've done my best with that frog.
Now's the time to do my worst.
- Open the door.
- No! You open the door.
- What?
- I'm through, Doc. The frog is right.
You're asking him to do something terrible. I can't be a part of it.
It's a moral decision and I'll stand by it.
- I'll double your percentage.
- I'll open the door.
FOZZIE: Kermit, where are we?
Well, let's see.
We were just traveling down this little black line here.
And we just crossed that little red line over here.
Well, how about...
Let's take the blue line, huh?
- No, we can't take that. That's a river.
- Oh, I knew that.
- Yeah, sure.
- Listen, Kermit, why don't we just go...
- Fozzie. Fozzie.
- Huh. Yeah?
Who's driving?
- KERMIT: Look out! Stop!
- FOZZIE: No problem.
- Okay, back it up.
- Ah, yes, sir.
- Fozzie, where did you learn to drive?
- I took a correspondence course.
This looks like a nice quiet spot.
Uh-huh.
Boy, it feels like we've been driving for days.
Yeah. Funny, I'm still wide awake.
Yeah, me, too.
Me, too.
- (BAND PLAYING)
- What? What? What? I'm up, I'm up.
What's that?
They don't look like Presbyterians to me.
Hey, cool it, everybody.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Our gentle mornin' melodies have attracted wanderin' admirers.
- Hey, who are you guys?
- We am, is, are and be they whom as are known as the Electric Mayhem.
- (LAUGHING)
- For sure.
He's Dr. Teeth.
Golden teeth and golden tones.
Welcome to my presence.
- Thank you.
- Fozzie.
- I'm Floyd, I blow bass.
- And I'm...
I'm...
Zoot. Sax is your ax.
Uh-oh. Zoot's skipped a groove again.
Wow, like, I'm Janice.
I'm lead guitar, for surely.
Oh, yeah. That's Animal.
Show 'em what you do, Animal.
I want to eat drums.
No, no. Beat drums, beat drums.
Beat drums. Beat drums.
- Down, Animal. Back. Sit.
- Down. Back. Sit.
MUPPET: Hey, don't forget about me.
I'm Scooter, the band's road manager.
Oh, yeah. The road manager.
We couldn't go anywhere without him.
- He's the man with the contacts?
- No, he's the man with the van.
Yeah, we're takin' this old church and turnin' it into a coffeehouse.
Yeah, with real good music and organic refreshments.
It'll be so fine and laid-back and mellow and profitable.
ANIMAL: Profitable.
Yeah, but what brings you dudes here?
Listen, see, Kermit here, he was living in the swamp...
- Fozzie.
...and then a fisherman came along.
Fozzie, you can't tell 'em the whole story.
You'll bore the audience.
Oh, sorry.
But, Kermit, the band here wants to know.
Well, let 'em read the screenplay.
Ah! Yes, sir.
Uh...
You see, it starts here on page one.
The Muppet Movie, huh?
Hmm. Let's see.
"Exterior. Swamp. Day.
In a long helicopter shot,
"we discover Kermit the Frog playin' his banjo and singin'.
"A Hollywood agent starts the frog travelin' west.
"Doc Hopper comes on strong and they get to this church.
"Interior. Church. Day.
"Fozzie. 'They don't look like
Presbyterians to me.'
"Kermit and Fozzie come walkin' down the aisle
"to the thunderously loud music of Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem."
- Which am us.
- For sure, for sure.
This is a narrative of very heavy-duty proportions.
Yeah. Cosmic, man.
We gotta keep his little froggy self away from this Hopper dude.
Too true, too true.
It is indeed a problem for us to probosculate upon.
But it seems to me that the frog and the bear are temporarily out of service.
Oh, wow, like, what can we do to help them?
- Well, if this were the movies...
- Which it is.
...we'd think of a clever plot device.
Like disguising their car so they won't be recognized.
Right. Two, three, four.
Oh, yeah!
Whoo!
All right.
Everybody's lover, everybody's brother
I wanna be your lifetime friend
Crazy as a rocket, nothin' in my pocket
I'll keep it at the rainbow's end
I never think of money
I think of milk and honey
Grinnin' like a Cheshire cat
I focus on the pleasure
Somethin' I can treasure
Can you picture that?
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Floyd. Take a verse.
(SINGING) Let me take your picture
Add it to the mixture
There it is, I got you now
Really nothin' to it, anyone can do it
It's easy and we all know how
Now begins the changin'
Mental rearrangin'
Nothin's really where it's at
Now the Eiffel Tower's holdin' up a flower
I gave it to a Texas cat
Fact is there's nothin' out there you can't do
Yeah, even Santa Claus believes in you
Beat down the walls
Begin, believe, begat
Be a better drummer
Be an up-and-comer
Can you picture that?
Only what you got
All of us are winnin'
Pickin' and a-grinnin'
Lordy, but I love to jam
Jelly-belly gigglin'
Dancin' and a-wigglin'
Honey, that's the way I am
I lost my heart in Texas
Northern lights affects us
I keep it underneath my hat
Aurora Borealis
Shinin' down on Dallas
Can you picture that?
Can you picture?
You gotta see it in your mind
Can you picture?
You know it's quick and easy to find
Can you picture?
You don't have to buy a frame
Can you picture?
Can you picture that?
- Use it if you need it
- Don't forget to feed it
Can you picture that?
FLOYD: Great job.
Doc Hopper will never recognize you now.
- I don't know how to thank you guys.
- I don't know why to thank you guys.
Our pleasure, green stuff.
Are you sure you won't come with us to Hollywood?
Can't, baby, but when you get rich and famous, maybe we'll show up and exploit your wealth.
Movin' right along, Fozzie.
ANIMAL: Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
(CHANTING) Hollywood! Hollywood!
Hollywood!
Hollywood! Hollywood! Hollywood!
HOPPER: Remember, this frog does everything.
He talks, he sings, he dances.
He tells jokes. He even rides a bicycle.
Max, find me a frog and a bear in a tan Studebaker.
Gee, Doc. All I can see is a frog and a bear in a rainbow-colored Studebaker.
What?
- Fozzie, they're right behind us.
- I know, I know.
- Well, how did they recognize us?
- They recognized you.
- What do you mean?
- There's a hundred bears around.
I'm gaining on 'em, Doc.
I'm gaining on 'em.
- Can't you drive any faster?
- No, sir.
There's a sign up ahead there.
Pull in front of that.
- Move. Now duck.
- What?
- Get down, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.
Aha!
- GONZO: Oh, yeah?
- (CLUCKING)
GONZO: Uh-huh. Yeah.
Oh, I tell you, Camilla, great plumbers are born, not made.
I'm a prince of plunger, fair maiden.
GONZO: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll do that. But first, wait till we get there.
Fozzie, look at that funny little truck.
Yeah, it's cute, huh?
- No, it's coming straight at us.
- (CLUCKS)
KERMIT: We're gonna hit.
We missed it.
Oh, you call that a miss?
GONZO: Well, I'm getting in your car.
FOZZIE: Oh, boy.
You guys okay?
Why are you hopping up and down?
Because I'm hopping mad.
Guy's got a sense of humor.
- Hey, why don't you join us?
- Where are you going?
- We're following our dream.
- Really? I have a dream, too.
- KERMIT AND FOZZIE: Huh?
- But you'll think it's stupid.
- KERMIT: No, I won't.
- FOZZIE: Tell us, tell us.
Well, I wanna go to Bombay, India and become a movie star.
CAMILLA: Ah.
You don't go to Bombay to become a movie star.
You go where we're going, Hollywood.
Sure, if you wanna do it the easy way.
We picked up a weirdo.
KERMIT: Hey, look up ahead.
There's Mad Man Mooney's.
- FOZZIE: What's that?
- KERMIT: It's a used-car lot.
I think we can trade in both these old cars and get one big one.
FOZZIE: Wait.
Trade in my uncle's Studebaker?
KERMIT: Sure.
FOZZIE: Oh, when he wakes up, he'll kill me.
KERMIT: You're swinging this turn very wide, Fozzie.
FOZZIE: Well, hold it, will you?
Just... Here we go. Up the bump.
KERMIT: There we go. Hold on. All right.
Pull up ahead there.
- FOZZIE: Look at these cars.
- GONZO: Kermit, Kermit, Kermit.
- Are you gonna sell my plunger, too?
- There's all kinds of great cars.
FOZZIE: No, he's not gonna sell your plunger.
KERMIT: Look at 'em up there.
Pull it up a little further here, Fozzie.
FOZZIE: Where should I stop?
- How should I stop?
- KERMIT: A little bit farther.
- GONZO: Easy, easy.
- FOZZIE: Okay. Here?
- KERMIT: Everybody out of the car.
- FOZZIE: Okay. Chickens first.
Oh, my dear friends. Welcome to Mad Man Mooney's hubcap heaven.
Today... Today is your lucky day.
- It is?
- Yes, it is. You, for example...
- You're driving the wrong car.
- I am?
I can put you in this German street machine for only $2,000, less a $12 trade-in on your old vehicle.
Now, this...
This car is one of the greatest...
Detachable fenders for narrow garages.
No, thanks.
Hey, what is this pile of...
Jack, get rid of this heap.
Come out here!
- What? What?
- What's the matter with you?
- That's my jack.
- Oh, hi, Jack.
Jack not name. Jack job.
How many times have I told you not to talk to the customers?
- Gee, I know, but...
- Just move this.
Move it. You understand?
FOZZIE: Wow. Ah!
But seriously, friends,
Mad Man Mooney doesn't believe in all that dealing and wheeling.
No, the price on the sticker is the price you pay.
- And never more and never less.
- (FLY BUZZING)
Ha.
We'll take that one for $11.95.
What?
Less our $12 trade-in.
You owe us a nickel.
Oh, thank you very much.
Hey, we're all going to Hollywood.
- Do you wanna come with us?
- Hollywood?
That's strange, he just ran away.
Well, movin' right along, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.
- (CLUCKING)
KERMIT: Hey, watch where you're going now, Fozzie.
FOZZIE: Yes, sir.
Hey!
Hey, where are you goin'?
Hey! Wait for me.
I wanna go to Hollywood.
Hey, wait for me!
Come on, guys. Wait! Please!
I wanna go to Hollywood.
Testing, one, two, three. Testing.
Can you hear me?
Well, it's time to announce the winner of this year's
Bogen County beauty pageant.
MAN: We sure grow 'em purdy around here, don't we?
All right. Here they are.
- MAN: The first runner-up...
- What's over there, Kermit?
- MAN: Is Debbie-Sue Anderson.
- Over there. See?
Ah! Nice-looking girls, huh?
- Wow. Nice-looking chickens.
- What?
- Oh, no hard feelings, honey.
- MAN: Before announcing the winner,
I think we should thank the judges of today's contest,
Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.
You're not gonna believe who the winner is, folks.
- Come, now, Charlie. It's their movie.
- So it is. So it is.
And here she is, folks.
This year's Miss Bogen County...
Miss Piggy!
Oh. Oh.
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
Thank you.
Wow, it's a pig. Did you see that?
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.
Oh. Oh, Debbie-Sue.
Oh, Elma-Jane.
Thank you. Thank you.
Ohh.
Thank you. Oh, oh, thank you.
Oh, kissy-kissy. Kissy-kissy.
Oh, thank you. Oh.
- Kermit, you know...
- Not... Not right now, Fozzie.
I just want to say one thing.
This is the happiest moment of my...
(SINGING) Never before
Have two souls joined so freely
And so fast
For me this is the first time
And the last
Is this an angel's wish
For men?
Never before
And never again
And where to find the words
To sing its worth
This love was bound for heaven
Not for Earth
This love was meant
To light the stars
But when we touched
We made it ours
And could they take it back?
Oh, no, they wouldn't dare
Why should they take it back
When there's enough
To share with all the world
And fill the heavens above
With leftover love?
Never before
A love that keeps on growing
On and on
To fill each lover's heart
And light the dawn
Is this an angel's wish
For men?
Never before
And never again
Never before
And never again
- Oh, oh.
- Thanks. Excuse me.
- Oh, yes. Of course.
- Yeah.
Listen, congratulations on winning the beauty contest.
Thank you. Of course, normally,
I don't do anything so trivial.
- I am an actress-model.
- Oh, is that right?
Well... I...
I'm gonna be a performer, too.
Oh.
Hey, Kermit.
Who's the cute-lookin' pig?
I beg your pardon.
If you were a chicken, you'd be impeccable.
Gonzo.
Hey, I thought we were gonna go get some ice cream.
Oh, well, in a minute. I'll join you.
Um...
Well...
What are you doing in town, short, green and handsome?
Well... We're headed west.
- Really?
- Yeah, but...
You know, I really should join my friends for ice cream.
Oh.
You... You wanna come along?
Me? You mean it? Oh.
I'll be right back. Oh, oh.
Don't move.
Hmm.
Hello. I'd like an ice cream.
What do you want? Chocolate, vanilla, coffee, peach fudge, rum, banana?
- Honey.
- Honey?
I beg your pardon. I hardly know you.
Ah.
But seriously,
I'd like a honey ice cream cone for me.
And a dragonfly ripple for my friend, the frog.
Okay. One honey cone for the bear.
- And one dragonfly ripple for the frog.
- Ugh!
- Don't get 'em mixed up.
- Gotcha.
All right, all right, Camilla.
I'll get you a balloon, but you have to pick the color.
Red or green?
- Can I give you a word of advice?
- GONZO: What?
Why not take both?
What a wild idea.
Yeah. A beautiful chicken like that deserves two balloons.
- You're right.
- I have guys come in all the time.
Sometimes they get a bunch of balloons for their girls.
- They go gaga for it.
- Gaga? I'll take the whole bunch.
Gaga. Gaga. Aw.
Gonzo?
Wonder...
Where they went? Fozzie?
FOZZIE: Kermit. Kermit.
Hey, Kermit. Hey.
Where's your pig friend?
Well, I'm not really sure. She said she was coming for ice cream, but...
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo.
Here I am. Here I am.
- I'm packed. I'm packed.
- Yeah, so I see.
What for?
You said I could come with you.
Yeah, but...
To buy ice cream, not to Hollywood.
- We're going to Hollywood?
- No. I mean, listen...
When I... When I said...
I mean, well, when you heard...
Oh, brother.
GONZO: Oh! Oh!
What? Gonzo?
- KERMIT: Gonzo! What are you doing?
- MISS PIGGY: What?
About seven knots.
- We'll follow you. To the car.
- Yes, sir.
KERMIT: Gonzo, we're coming!
- KERMIT: Step on it, Fozzie!
- FOZZIE: Yes, sir.
MISS PIGGY: Oh, Kermit.
You're a born leader.
KERMIT: Now, where is he?
(SIGHS) Isn't this great?
Here I am floating in space.
This is the place to be.
Whoopee!
- Fozzie.
- Yes.
- Bear left.
- What?
- Bear left.
- Right, Frog.
- What? That's cute.
- Never mind.
This is...
Look at our little car down there.
Oh, this is like flying.
Hey, this is flying.
I'm flying! Whoopee!
Doc, isn't that a frog up there?
No, that's a frog down here.
KERMIT: He's caught in a crosswind,
Fozzie.
We're gonna lose him.
FOZZIE: Oh, no.
- Oh, what are you doin', Doc?
- I'm goin' after the tires.
KERMIT: We're okay now.
The wind's shifted.
- Wait a minute. Stay with him, Fozzie.
- FOZZIE: Yeah.
- He's right above us.
- GONZO: Whoo-hoo!
- He's okay.
- Yeah. Hi, Gonzo.
- Fozzie, come back in here.
- What?
- Come back in here.
- Yes, sir.
Oh!
KERMIT: Why don't you stay on the road?
Kermit!
KERMIT: Look out for the billboard.
MAX: No!
- Take off, Fozzie.
- Yes, sir.
Come back, you!
No frog's gonna make a monkey out of me!
I'm back.
I don't understand any of this.
I just gotta catch up with those guys.
MISS PIGGY: Kermit, you were so courageous.
So magnificent.
- Gee, I don't know what to say.
- Say the bear was magnificent.
After all, I did the driving.
And I took a 100-foot belly flop onto a moving car.
Yes, but Kermit assumed the awesome responsibility of command.
- Gee.
- Oh, brother.
Um...
Why don't we stop somewhere for the night and have a quiet little dinner...
For two?
Terrific! I'll eat with you, Miss Piggy.
Not you, buzzard beak.
Just mon capitaine and moi.
Well... That... That might be nice.
Oh. Wow.
Good evening, Miss Piggy.
You look lovely tonight.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry if I kept you waiting.
Oh, it... It was worth it.
How charming of vous.
I... I took the liberty of ordering us some wine.
Mmm.
Oh, waiter.
Yes?
May I help you?
The... The wine, please.
Mmm.
You mad, impetuous thing.
It's champagne.
Not exactly. Sparkling muscatel.
One of the finest wines of Idaho.
Well, you may serve us now, please.
Oh, may I?
- Look how he does that.
- Yep.
- Very suave.
- Mmm.
Don't you want to smell the bottle cap?
Oh.
- Mmm-hmm. Smells good.
- Mmm. Yes.
- Would you like to taste it first?
- Well...
I think he's supposed to.
Would you taste it for us, please?
Ugh!
- Excellent choice.
- Should be for 95 cents.
Hmm.
- And may we have straws, please?
- Yes.
I expected that.
Thank you. That'll be all for now.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
- Here's to you, Miss Piggy.
- Oh.
Drink up.
Oh.
Makes me giggly.
The wine?
Everything.
It's a beautiful evening, isn't it?
Mmm-hmm.
The moon is just lovely.
Mmm-hmm.
You know, Miss Piggy, the moon doesn't look like you.
- WAITER: Miss Piggy.
- Hmm.
Miss Piggy.
- Are you Miss Piggy?
- Yes.
- Telephone.
- Oh.
Uh... Oh...
Kermie, I did place one phone call to my agent.
It'll only be an eensy-teensy moment.
What the hey?
Evenin'. Rowlf, Rowlf the Dog.
Sit yourself down.
- Kermit, Kermit the Frog.
- Pleased to meet you.
I'm no Heifetz, but I get by.
That was... That was very nice.
- (SNIFFS)
- Oh.
A broken heart, right?
- Does it show?
- Listen.
When you've been ticklin' the ivories as long as I have, you've seen a broken heart for every drop of rain, a shattered dream for every fallen star.
Exactly. She just walked out on me.
Yeah? Typical. That's why I live alone.
- You do, huh?
- You bet.
I finish work, I go home, read a book, have a couple of beers, take myself for a walk and go to bed.
Nice and simple.
Stay away from women, that's my motto.
- But I can't.
- Neither can I. That's my trouble.
(SINGING) You can't live with 'em
You can't live without 'em
There's somethin' irresistible-ish about 'em
We grin and bear it
'cause the nights are long
I hope that somethin' better comes along
I see what you mean.
It's no good complainin'
And pointless to holler
If she's a beauty
She'll get under your collar
She made a monkey out of old King Kong
I hope that somethin' better comes along
Still, it's fun when they're fetchin'
And agree to see an etching that you keep at your lily pad
There is no solution
It's part of evolution
The pitter-patter of souls
The little feet of tadpoles
Rowlf, tadpoles don't have feet.
Oh, sorry about that. Two, three, four.
There's no limitation to mixin' and matchin'
Some get an itchin' for a critter they've been scratchin'
A skunk was badgered
The results were strong
I hope that somethin' better
I hope that somethin' better comes along
WAITER: Phone call for Kermit the Frog.
- Are you Kermit the Frog?
- Yeah.
Phone.
Huh.
It's not often you see a guy that green have the blues that bad.
- Hello.
- Kermie, please...
- Piggy, is that you?
- HOPPER: Yes, that's her.
And this is Doc Hopper.
You listen, Frog. And listen good.
Step outside the motel right now.
My guys will meet you there.
Well... What if I don't?
Then your girlfriend will be ham-hocked by breakfast.
Kermie. Don't, don't, don't, don't.
Uh, uh...
Are you the guys I'm supposed to meet?
That's good, Glen. That's good.
That's nice and tight.
- The Professor's here, Doc.
- Show him in. Show him in.
Kermie, I'm not a bit worried.
I know you're planning something bold and clever.
Well, I got us this far, didn't I?
- How are you?
- Ah, Professor Krassman.
It's good to see you, Doc, you little rustic devil, you.
Where's my victim?
I mean, patient?
Step this way, Professor.
Let me introduce you to your patient.
Professor Krassman is the world's leadin' authority on mind control in frogs.
It's a very rapidly growing field.
You like garlic, don't you?
Tell us what you're gonna do to our little Kermit.
Well, we're going to perform an electronic cerebrectomy.
- Hmm?
- A what?
- (GASPS)
- Electronic cerebrectomy.
What's that?
It's something so sensational that you'll have to hold on to your hat.
Yes?
When a German scientist says,
"Hold on to your hat," it's not casual conversation.
Hold on to your hat! Hat! Hold! Good.
Now, what we're going to do is bring out a machine that's going to wow you.
Bertram! Bertram, you...
Bring out the machine!
Wait till you see this.
You think we're sleeping in Düsseldorf?
You think we're taking a nap in Cologne?
No, we're working at night.
Each night a new dial, a new knob...
Electronic...
Cerebrectomy, cerebrectomy.
Electronic cerebrectomy.
- What does it do?
- What does it do? What does it do?
It turns the brains into guacamole.
First of all, I'll pull out of this, okay?
Wonderful.
Second?
Halt! Argh!
I detest the surfeit of provincial laughter.
Now, we take your friend, the little F-O-R-G, put him in the chair, clamp on the terminals, drop the electronic yarmulke, and throw, what we call in German, the switch.
Yes, you little green devil. Soon it'll be a hot time for the old skull tonight.
Thank you, Herr Machine.
Now, the frog will do your bidding.
He will do your every whim, your every wish.
He will do your television commercial, yes.
He will sell your frogs' legs.
- Zaparoonie.
- Head full of jelly.
- A noggin full of library paste.
- Let's fry them brains!
Professor Krassman, you've got a fun job.
I love it, I love it.
If I can inflict a little pain during the afternoon, I sleep good at night.
- Well, we'll let you get on with it, then.
- My pleasure.
Max.
I'll be back later to pick up what's left of the frog.
What's left of the frog?
You can have everything, excuse the brain.
All right. Bring over the frog.
Oh, Kermie.
Whatever happens next,
I wouldn't give up this evening together for anything.
- Would you?
- Make me an offer.
Oh, Kermie.
- Hey.
- Okay.
I got him. I got him.
Good, good, good, good, good.
And why don't we take a little seat, Kermit?
Hands down.
- Get the feet into place.
- (WHIMPERING)
Will you stop whimpering?
Go out like a frog, not a little toad.
Okay, Herr Machine.
This is big time here.
Ready to go to work? Hand clamps!
Foot clamps!
You can struggle all you want now, frog.
It'll do you very little good.
All right. And now it's time to drop the electronic beanie.
Soon, there'll be enough voltage coursing through your little frog brain to light up Cincinnati.
Oh, please, please. Not my frog. Please!
- Say goodbye to the frog, pig.
- Why should I?
Because in 10 seconds, he won't know you from kosher bacon.
That does it!
Hi-yah!
Hi! Hi!
Hi-yah!
Hii-yah!
Hii-yah! Hi! Hi!
Hii-yah!
Hi-yah!
What the heck's goin' on here?
A pig that goes bananas?
What is this? A luau?
- MAN: Where'd she go?
- MISS PIGGY: Oh, boys.
- There she is.
- Get her!
I must reach the switch. I must...
- Switch. I must reach...
- Oh, no.
Hi-yah!
- Now, Kermie.
- Oh, thank you.
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.
Well...
Shall we go now, Kermie?
Well...
Just a second.
Hello.
- Piggy, it's your agent.
- Ooh.
Thank you.
Yeah, Morty, what have you got?
Commercial?
How much? Mmm-hmm.
When?
Take it.
(NORMAL VOICE) Um.
Goodbye.
- FOZZIE: What's going on?
- Hey, what happened?
Irritated!
Don't worry, Animal.
Your big scene is coming up.
Yeah, yeah. Just be cool and eat another seat cushion.
Seat cushion!
Well, how do you like the film?
I've seen detergents that leave a better film than this.
Well, I don't care what anybody else says.
I'm having a great time.
Oh, good.
Der flim is okey-dokey.
- Good. Roll film.
- Flim is rolling.
- GONZO: Quiet.
- FOZZIE: Quiet.
FOZZIE: Quiet, Gonzo.
- This is the patriotic part.
- Should we stand up?
No.
FOZZIE: O beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plains
America, America
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
Patriotism swells in the heart of the American bear.
Hold it, boys. Hold it!
Hold your fire!
Boys, no reflection on the job you've been doin', but I decided to bring in a specialist.
Now, boys, this is Snake Walker.
Tell 'em what you do, Snake.
Kill frogs.
FOZZIE: How long is it to Hollywood?
KERMIT:
We gotta be there by tomorrow.
GONZO: Hey, Kermit. Are you gonna get an agent like that pig had?
FOZZIE: Gonzo, you know he's touchy about that.
- ROWLF: Hey, who's that?
- KERMIT: I don't believe that.
- KERMIT: Piggy?
- FOZZIE: Kermit.
Kermit.
- That's Piggy.
- Yeah, I know.
ROWLF: Hey, do you think we should help her with her bag?
- ALL: No.
- Kermie.
Kermie, what an unbelievable coincidence.
FOZZIE: Hmm.
Hello again. It's me.
Would you hold my vanity case?
Hi-yah!
- Well.
- Well, what?
So much has happened to me since I saw you last.
- Yeah, sure.
- Frankly, Miss Piggy, I don't give a hoot.
My name is Rowlf the Dog and I was playing the piano... Oh, never mind.
- Kermie.
- Yeah?
- I missed you.
- Yeah.
Don't I get one kissy-kissy?
Uh, no, I... I don't think so, Miss Piggy.
Just one little hug.
FOZZIE: Hmmm.
- Oh, Piggy.
- Kermie.
HOPPER: (ON RADIO)
You've been listenin' to music to hug frogs by.
And this is Doc Hopper sayin' that if Kermit the Frog don't stop right now and call me, and agree to be my national spokesman, he will soon be a frog burger.
Kermie. Ah!
We'll be okay.
Mon capitaine.
- FOZZIE: Oh, boy. Yeah, what?
- KERMIT: Fozzie?
FOZZIE: No problem. It's okay, it's okay.
No problem. Okay, all right.
- Listen...
- KERMIT: Oh, boy.
FOZZIE: Oh, we're in trouble.
I wish I still had my Studebaker.
ROWLF: Probably somethin' broken about the engine, I think.
GONZO: Hey, don't worry.
Someone's bound to come along.
Well, I guess we blew it, huh, Gonzo?
Yeah.
But the sky sure is beautiful out here.
Look at that.
We...
We're gonna miss the auditions tomorrow, right?
Kermit?
GONZO: Boy, you could get lost in a sky like that.
I wish I had those balloons again.
So much for Hollywood.
Listen, gang.
I never promised we'd make it.
I never promised anything.
(SINGING) This looks familiar
Vaguely familiar
Almost unreal, yet
It's too soon to feel yet
Close to my soul
And yet so far away
I'm going to go back there someday
Sun rises, night falls
Sometimes the sky calls
Is that a song there?
And do I belong there?
I've never been there
But I know the way
I'm going to go back there someday
Come and go with me
It's more fun to share
We'll both be completely
At home in midair
We're flyin', not walking
On featherless wings
We can hold on to love
Like invisible strings
There's not a word yet
For old friends who've just met
Part heaven, part space
Or have I found my place?
You can just visit
But I plan to stay
I'm going to go back there
Someday
I'm going to go back there
Someday
I didn't promise anybody anything.
What do I know about Hollywood anyway?
Just the dreams I got from sitting through too many double features.
KERMIT'S VOICE: So, why did you leave the swamp in the first place?
'Cause some agent fella said I had talent.
He probably says that to everybody.
On the other hand, if you hadn't left the swamp, you'd be feeling pretty miserable anyhow.
Yeah, but then it would just be me feeling miserable.
Now I got a lady pig and a bear, and a chicken, a dog, a thing, whatever Gonzo is.
He's a little like a turkey.
Yeah. A little like a turkey, but not much.
No, I guess not.
Anyhow, I brought 'em all out here into the middle of nowhere.
It's all my fault.
Still, whether you promised them something or not, you gotta remember they wanted to come.
But that's because they believed in me.
No, they believed in the dream.
- Well, so do I, but...
- You do?
Yeah. Of course I do.
- Well, then?
- Well, then...
I guess I was wrong when I said I never promised anyone.
I promised me.
Hey. Now, wait a minute.
Hey, what... What's happening?
At the moment, we're what's happening.
Oh, great. Wonderful. Yeah.
Zoot, hey, Zoot.
Hold it, hold it.
Animal, cool it back there.
Yeah.
All right, yeah.
Hey, listen, it's wonderful to see you guys, but how did you ever find us?
Oh, easy.
We just read the screenplay you left us.
"Exterior. Desert. Night."
We knew right where you were.
Like, can you get behind it?
Hey, listen. When do you dudes have to be at that audition?
2:00 tomorrow afternoon.
Well, climb aboard the bus. We'll have breakfast at Hollywood and Vine.
ALL: Movin' right along
FLOYD: Oh, yeah.
TEETH: Here we go.
Movin' right along
Kermie, whisper sweet nothings into my ear.
Motorcycle cop.
Motorcycle cop is a sweet nothing?
A motorcycle cop is chasing us.
- Hey, Dr. Teeth, you better pull over.
- Hey, easier done than said.
FLOYD: Uh-oh.
JANICE: Drag city.
What do we do now, huh?
Oh, dear.
TEETH: Hey, hey.
The man with the badge.
The police, the cops, the fuzz, the P.I...
- Don't you dare!
- I wouldn't think of it.
Did we do something wrong, Officer?
- Kermit, it's him.
- Okay, gang. Let him explain.
This whole disguise is only so I could warn you.
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.
I never thought that Doc was gonna hurt Kermit.
I only thought he was gonna lean on him a little.
But now he's got this frog killer in from the coast, and the man is deadly.
FOZZIE: Oh, no, Kermit.
What are we gonna do?
- It's time to beat feet, green stuff.
- FOZZIE: Let's get out of here, Kermit.
I love it.
Chase music is one of our best riffs.
Hold it, Dr. Teeth. What's up ahead?
- It's only an old ghost town.
- Fine.
Listen, you go back and tell Doc Hopper
I'll be waiting for him there.
- What?
- What?
- Kermit, you'll get killed.
- Oh, please, no.
- FOZZIE: Kermit, you can't do that.
- Now, listen, guys.
Listen, I can't spend my whole life running away from a bully.
It's time for a showdown.
Showdown! Showdown!
Uh, hey, listen,
I'm gonna check things out.
- Everybody stay in the bus, okay?
- Mmm-hmm.
Hey, Kermit.
Can I take Animal for a walk?
He needs some exercise.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
What is that?
That's one of my latest inventions.
A musical rotating rain barrel.
Oh, oh, yeah.
You see, I'm Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and this is my assistant, Beaker.
We live here perfecting useful inventions.
- Come in, come in.
- (MEEPING)
BUNSEN:
Welcome to our laboratory.
Please don't touch anything.
Uh...
- Is this the only street into town?
- Yes, yes.
Hey, what are you dudes doin' in here?
I'm so glad you asked.
We're perfecting our latest invention.
Insta-Grow pills.
Yeah, well, what in the name of Fats Waller is that?
A 4-foot prune.
A 4-foot prune?
Yeah, man, well, what else do these pills make big?
Oh, they work on anything, but the effect is sadly temporary.
Sadly temporary. (SIGHS)
Oh, no!
SCOOTER: Hey, Kermit.
Here comes Doc Hopper.
I know. I'll be ready for him.
Okay, Frog. Where are you?
KERMIT: I'm here.
I'll meet you in the middle of the street.
Oh, yeah?
KERMIT: Man to frog.
- KERMIT: All right, Hopper.
- All right, Frog.
One last chance.
You gonna do my TV commercials live or stuffed?
Hopper, what's the matter with you?
You gotta be crazy, chasin' me halfway across the country.
Why are you doing this to me?
'Cause all my life, I wanted to own a thousand frog leg restaurants, and you're the key, greenie.
Yeah, well, I've got a dream, too.
But it's about singing and dancing and making people happy.
That's the kind of dream that gets better the more people you share it with.
And, well, I've found a whole bunch of friends who have the same dream.
And...
And it kind of makes us like a family.
Do you have anybody like that, Hopper?
I mean, once you get all those restaurants, who are you gonna share it with?
Who are your friends, Doc?
Those guys?
Max.
I got lots of friends.
Max, for instance.
- Max.
- I don't think you're a bad man, Doc.
And I think if you look in your heart, you'll find you really wanna let me and my friends go to follow our dreams.
But if that's not the kind of man you are, or what I'm saying doesn't make any sense to you, well, then, go ahead and kill me.
All right, boys.
Kill him.
No, wait, please.
Animal!
Ha! Ha, ha, ha!
Everybody, on to Hollywood.
ALL: Yay!
GONZ0: Wow! Wicked!
TEETH: Yeah, next stop is Hollywood and Vine.
FOZZIE: Look at the ocean. The ocean.
Yes, Mr. Lord. I'll have those deal numbers for you in a jiffy.
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Mmm-hmm.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Lord can't be disturbed by anyone.
He's packaging a blockbuster.
Mmm-hmm.
- Ah, Kermie, look, it's wonderful.
- Yeah.
Like a dream come true.
Well, don't count your tadpoles until they're hatched.
- I still have to audition, you know.
- Hey, there ain't nothin' to it, but to do it.
And where do you think you're going?
Oh, hi, there.
I'm going to audition for Lew Lord.
You can't just walk in here off the street, you know.
Especially not with all these animals.
Animals? What's wrong with animals?
ANIMAL: Animal!
This is a movie studio, not a zoo!
Besides...
I'm allergic to animal hair.
Now, get along, all of you.
No. Wait a second. See here, miss.
I may not be one of your fancy Hollywood frogs, but I deserve a chance.
And we're gonna stay right here in this office until you let us in to see Lew Lord.
- Aren't we, gang, huh?
- Yes!
- FLOYD: What he says.
- GONZO: Yeah, come on.
KERMIT: We'll just sit right down and wait.
Hello, security, it's Miss Tracey.
I wanna report a... (SNEEZES)
GONZO: Shake. Shake.
Shake, everyone.
KERMIT: That's it.
GONZO: Good, good, good. Do it.
- FLOYD: Yeah, go get 'em, Animal.
- KERMIT: Way to go.
FOZZIE: Allergies are nothing to sneeze at.
TEETH: I'm allergic to cats myself.
KERMIT: That's it, Rowlf.
- We got it.
- (CAMILLA CLUCKS)
- KERMIT: Wow.
- (BUZZER SOUNDS)
FLOYD: Yeah, all right.
- Okay, way to go, guys.
- FOZZIE: All right.
Thanks, miss.
Well, friends, this is it.
Uh, Mr. Lord, forgive the interruption, but I'm here to audition.
MISS PIGGY: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
KERMIT: We've come over 2,000 miles...
Uh, oh, boy.
Kermie, we're all with you.
Please, sir. My name is Kermit the Frog, and we read your ad and...
Well, we've come to be rich and famous.
Miss Tracey.
Prepare the standard
"Rich and Famous" contract for Kermit the Frog and company.
Yes. We did it. We did it.
I can't believe it.
Oh, just look at all this.
How did a frog make the big time?
(SINGING) It starts when we're kids
A show-off at school
Makin' faces at friends
You're a clown and a fool
Doin' pratfalls and bird calls and bad imitations
Ignoring your homework
Now that's dedication
You work to the mirror
You're getting standing ovations
You're burning with hope
You're building up steam
What was once juvenile-ish
Is grown-up and stylish
You're close to your dream
And somebody out there loves you
Stands up and hollers for more
More!
You've found a home at the magic store
Right, everybody.
Production number, okay?
- Off the trucks and on the job.
- On the job!
Hey, whoa, halt, cease, stop.
Wow, let's do it.
- Do what?
- The movie.
FOZZIE: Yes, sir. A foot stomper.
- Makeup.
- Yes, let's do it. Yes.
Hey, Fozzie, take those wagons out of there.
Yes, sir. I'm off.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Scenery over there, right?
Movin' right along. Hey!
Hey, those are the trees for the swamp.
Mellow and profitable.
Wacka, wacka.
- Let's make a scene.
- Okay, hon.
- Watch the tree, Rowlf.
- Careful, Scooter.
Ow.
- Watch it!
- (MEEPS)
- Miss Piggy, you look beautiful.
- MISS PIGGY: Thank you.
Hollywood talk.
Wa ha ha ha.
Wa ha ha ha ha.
- Good.
- Wa ha!
The lights. Yeah.
Good. Save those arcs.
Ha, ha.
Crazy Harry plays with electricity!
Sound is ready. Give me a level.
(YELLS) Testing!
Rolling.
Okay, everybody. Stay in focus, huh?
Okay, Muppet Movie, scene 1A, take one.
- BEAKER: Makeup ready.
- FLOYD: Scenery ready.
- BUNSEN: Sound is rolling.
- ROWLF: Camera's rollin'.
MISS PIGGY: All ready, Kermie.
Okay, standby. Here we go.
(SINGING) Why are there so many songs about rainbows?
That's part of what rainbows do
Rainbows are memories
Sweet dream reminders
What is it you'd like to do?
All of us watching and wishing we'd find it
I've noticed you're watching, too
Someday you'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and...
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Kermit.
(SINGING) Life's like a movie
Write your own ending
Keep believing, keep pretending
We've done just what we've set out to do
Thanks to the lovers
The dreamers
And you
I just knew I'd catch up with you guys.
- What did you think?
- It was sick and weird.
Kermit, it went swell. It went great, boss.
Congratulations, Mr. The Frog.
You can be in the next one, Lew.
Great show.
Oh, wow.
Woman!
- Did you like my close-up?
- Oh, yes.
Did you like my song?
How about my karate?
Kermit. Oh, Kermie.
Was I funny? Was I funny, anybody?
Fozzie, you were very, very funny.
Just great.
Go home! Go home!
Stop!
Catch them! Don't let them get away!
THANKS SO MUCH
We got five billion in various denominations.
It's a shower of bills. Look out!
There's a lot, isn't there?
More! Bury me with them.
- What's wrong, Lupin?
- Dump them.
What?
These are fakes. Good ones, but fakes.
These? It can't be. We stole these from the vault of the national casino.
It's Goat Money.
Goat Money?
You mean the phantom counterfeit?
It's even hit the national casino.
Jigen, I've decided what our next job will be.
First, we're gonna celebrate.
Damn, damn, damn you!
THE CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO
It's not a name you hear a lot, the Duchy of Cagliostro.
3,500 inhabitants. It's the smallest member state of the UN.
And that's where the Goat Money comes from?
It's legendary.
The black hole of forged banknotes.
A black hole?
Nobody who's gone there to investigate has ever returned.
How scary.
It's so scary I'll take a nap.
- Hey!
- What?
The spare tyre's worn out.
It's so peaceful.
- What's going on?
- Let's go!
- Who shall we follow?
- The girl!
Of course.
- Hit the tyre.
- Right!
Damn, that's no ordinary car.
Now things have gotten interesting.
Here we go.
We've caught up to them.
This is no ordinary bullet, mates!
I got 'em!
She's blacked out!
- Her car's breaking up!
- Take the wheel!
- No! Let go of me!
- No, stop that! We're in danger!
Look down! Down! Down! Down!
There now. That's better.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Forgive me.
Hey, Lupin. What a sight you are.
Where's my bride?
Damn!
Why the hell are those thugs going after some young girl?
It's a ring.
My God, I've seen this somewhere before.
What's going on? You got all excited when you saw that ring!
Lupin!
Hey, Lupin, what's in this old castle?
It's the same crest as the ring, Lupin.
It hasn't been deserted very long.
- A fire?
- Who's there?
- Just some guys passing through.
- Sightseers?
Yeah. I thought that perhaps this was the palace of His Highness the Archduke?
It still is. This is no place for strangers to hang around.
You mean to say that this is the Archduke's palace? It's a skeleton.
That's because of the great fire of seven years ago.
Ever since the Archduke and Duchess died the castle has been left to ruin, just as you see it.
That's strange.
The Archduke is the ruler. Does that mean that there is no ruler now?
I shouldn't worry about it if I were you, as there is a regent.
Now go away.
Okay, okay.
Hey, Lupin.
She's grown up.
What is it?
Don't play innocent with me.
Don't suffer in silence. Talk!
You're choking me.
- Well? Are you gonna talk?
- All right, all right, I'll talk.
That's the castle of the regent,
Count Cagliostro.
Look over there.
No, lower down.
Beyond the aqueduct bridge.
That boat! The bride's in that castle?
There's a ﬂoodgate at that spot, same as before.
Did you slip into that castle?
It happened more than ten years ago.
I tried to solve the mystery of the
Goat Money. I was still a young punk.
So what happened?
They gave me hell. I ran away with my tail between my legs.
That autogyro's an antique.
That'll be the Count.
Come on, let's find an inn.
That was careless, Jodo.
I'm sorry.
The men were outside while she was being fitted for her wedding dress.
Is she in the North Tower now?
Yes. She is sleeping peacefully thanks to a sedative.
Foreigners?
Yes. It seems that two men lent a hand in her escape.
Find them.
I leave it to you to take care of them.
The ring's gone?
Summon Jodo!
These characters are in the long-extinct Goat Alphabet.
The Goat Alphabet?
"Light and Shadow will not recombine and revive, 1517."
The date is in Roman numerals.
A 400-year-old affair?
- Here you are, gentlemen.
- Looks delicious.
What are you looking at?
Why, I picked up an old ring.
I wonder if it's valuable.
Oh, that's pretty.
That's Lady Clarisse's crest.
Clarisse?
Look. That photo over there.
That's her when she was a little girl.
She was brought back from the convent yesterday.
- I'm sure she's a lovely young woman.
- Convent?
Don't you know?
I thought you gentlemen had also come to see the wedding of Lady Clarisse and the Count.
That's why there are so many tourists.
But poor Lady Clarisse.
The Count is a notorious womaniser.
You mean like me!
What are you doing tonight?
No! Disgusting!
So he's a spy for the Count after all.
He got excited when he saw the ring.
So it's not just the bride.
He's after the ring, too.
I won't let him have it.
You knew that girl we met today was the daughter of the Archduke, didn't you?
You mean I didn't tell you?
"Light and Shadow will not recombine and revive."
Could it mean that a treasure will arise instead, perhaps?
An armed escort!
My magnum has no effect.
These guys are professional assassins.
Hurry.
- I tell you, they scared me.
- They attacked in full force.
There's more to this than meets the eye.
Things are getting interesting.
These are no good.
The quality just gets worse, doesn't it?
I'm sorry, but continuing the present mass production programme will have that result.
Start over! We cannot move back the date of delivery.
- Yes, sir.
- Who's there?
The failure is mine.
I let the rats escape.
Jodo, what's that piece of paper on your back?
What? I never noticed it.
Lupin...
It's an advance-warning card from Lupin.
Read it.
Yes, sir, but...
It's all right.
"To the Count of lust and greed,
"give me your bride.
I'll call on you soon. Lupin III."
Excellent, Jodo.
Why don't we wait for Lupin to come to us?
Well! You got here quick.
Is there a job?
Goemon's arrived.
He's not the only one. Take a look.
That's a Japanese patrol car.
- That'll be Zenigata.
- What?
Fall in!
And with that, the stars are all in place.
Excuse me for interrupting your meal.
I'm Inspector Zenigata of ICPO.
I was notified that you had received
Lupin's advance-warning card and came out here.
Are you referring to the scandalous Arsene Lupin III?
For that, Interpol disturbs a man's breakfast, do they?
Your Excellency, do not underestimate Lupin.
If he says he's going to come,
I guarantee you he'll show up.
Your wedding is still five days away.
Please allow us to guard your castle.
In this country, we have a police force, too.
Only we refer to them more elegantly as "royal guards".
You rang, sir?
Gustav, cooperate with the Japanese.
You may go.
- Yes, sir.
- One more thing, Your Excellency.
Please tell me why that damned Lupin is after your bride.
Well, investigating that is your job, too, isn't it?
Excuse me.
Is it a good idea letting someone like that into the castle?
It's all right, don't worry about it.
I have plenty of friends in Interpol, too. He'll soon leave.
That's Zenigata.
Truly the ideal of the Showa Period.
A man incomparable for his determination to his work.
What's that over there?
Don't go beyond this point.
What?
Watch.
Don't loiter around if you don't want to die. Inform your men as well.
Inspector, they have anti-personnel radar.
This castle gives me the creeps.
The defences are far too large for dealing with ordinary crooks.
A woman?
Hold it. Don't talk about backing out.
There is a woman, but that's not all there is to it.
There's something about this ring you mentioned?
We'll find that out if we get the girl back from the Count, the horny old goat.
In any case, my magnum was ineffective.
Your sword and this anti-tank rifle, though...
Hey, Lupin, did you find a way in?
No, it's amazing.
It's a nest of lasers and radars.
I see. We'll need tanks, eh?
- So you sent for Zenigata, didn't you?
- What? Is that true, Lupin?
Exactly. You catch on fast.
Treat poison with poison.
This is Cagliostro Castle. We're here.
This Roman aqueduct is still in use.
It's the only way in.
Water ﬂows from this lake into the castle via the aqueduct.
I get it, there won't be any lasers underwater.
Goemon, keep an eye out.
Watch your step. There's a hole.
The first lock.
Here we go.
Lupin!
That's the clock tower.
I wonder if he made it okay, the bum.
What's that Windmill?
According to Gustav, it brings water up into the castle.
- Where's the outlet for that water?
- The fountain in the upper turret.
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.
Inspector! Orders from
Paris Headquarters to pull out.
They say, "Return at once."
What? That's ridiculous.
I'm gonna verify it.
What? My reason for coming here was Lupin's advance-warning...
The Count did?
Police officers are not in the business of catering to individual whims.
Hello? Hello?
Damn.
I'll take this to the Count.
Take me to your Count.
I want to see the Count immediately.
Didn't you hear me? Let me in.
Desist.
Only those who are trustworthy can pass beyond this point.
What?
Are you saying you can't trust Interpol?
You are supposed to have received orders to leave here. Do so.
How... How do you know that?
We don't use Orientals for the likes of Lupin. Go away.
I see. All right. We'll leave for now.
- Was I here just now?
- What?
You idiot! That was Lupin!
He snuck in here disguised as me.
Can't you see through a disguise, you big lummox? Cretin!
After them!
Don't let Lupin escape.
Lupin!
Cut it out, it's Lupin.
Help the Inspector! Charge!
Man, oh, man!
Stop it! It's Lupin!
Lupin!
Someone seems to have been caught.
The fool.
He should have left right away.
The guards are missing. Gustav!
What is he doing, leaving his post?
- You stay here.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry about that, old man.
You moron!
Stop this imbecilic fight at once!
Don't you understand? Lupin successfully tricked you into letting him in.
Damn it!
Let go!
So Lupin got in after all.
I am ashamed.
Inform the police that the Inspector already left.
If he vanishes en route, that's the way it goes.
Yes, sir.
Don't move.
- Good evening, Fujiko.
- Lupin!
A woman hard at work is beautiful, isn%she?
You came all this way for that?
I've looked all over for you, because it's hard not seeing you for a whole year, you know?
Lupin, you're hunting down the bride's whereabouts, am I correct?
Hey! You know where she is?
If I tell you, will you keep out of my business?
Yes, yes. I won't interfere.
I just bet...
She's at the top of the North Tower.
But it's very difficult to get in, you know.
Lupin?
That's a cruel cage they've shut you up in indeed.
Who's there?
A thief.
A thief?
Good evening, Miss Bride.
You! You're that man from before, aren't you?
You left this behind.
You risked being caught and killed by the Count for this?
Why, it's the way of thieves to risk their lives.
If the job is finished, I'll leave.
The job?
I wish I had something to give you but, for now, I'm a prisoner.
Take this!
My prize is a treasure, locked away atop a high tower by an evil magician.
Please allow this humble thief to steal it.
You mean me?
I will reclaim the treasure locked away in the vault, and I will release it into a green field, the girl they are attempting to force into becoming a bride.
It's all in a thief s work.
You mean you'll set me free?
Thank you. I'm very happy.
But you don't understand how terrible the House of Cagliostro is.
Please go away.
Oh, what a terrible thing.
The girl believes in the power of the evil magician, but she wouldn't try to believe in the power of the thief.
If she would only believe, the thief would be able to fly through the air and even drain a lake of its water.
This is all I can do for now.
Mr Thief!
Hey! Treat the lady more respectfully.
Thank you for going to the trouble of delivering the ring, Lupin.
I'm overwhelmed by your warm reception, Count.
It's high time you were eliminated.
Do you think you can do away with me as easily as that?
No! Stop! Don't hurt him!
It's all right. You've got to believe in the thief s power, my dear.
Lupin!
Yes, I'm right here, and I'll be right back.
So, what's the name of the game?
It would be easy enough to rend you to pieces, but I don't want to stain this room with the blood of a sneak thief, after all.
You'll eat those words after this.
Your last words amount to a useless retort.
That hole leads to hell. No single person can worm their way out of it.
You've already charmed a man with your looks.
It's the Cagliostro blood, undeniably.
You're worthy of becoming my wife.
Murderer! You're inhuman!
Why, yes.
My hands are stained in blood.
But then, so are yours.
My Count's House has propped up this country for generations, handling conspiracy and assassination, as the Shadow of your Archduke's House.
Let go of me! You're repulsive!
Don't tell me you don't know all that.
You are a Cagliostro, too.
The ancient Goat blood ﬂows through your veins, just like mine.
Clarisse, the two houses of Cagliostro, which have been separated into Light and Shadow for over 400 years, will now become one.
Look...
When I bring together the gold goat that symbolises my house with your silver ring, the hidden ancestral treasure will revive.
I heard that! I heard that!
This is a wedding for treasure!
It's him!
Everything this counterfeit Count says and does is a lie!
The girl is a very gentle and wonderful child.
- Lupin! Lupin!
- Yes, I'm fine!
I can ﬂy through the air, because you believe in me.
You just wait, because your thief promises to steal you away.
Yes!
Damn! It's the ring, is it?
Give it to me.
Hey, Count, listen and listen good.
I've got the real ring.
If you lay a finger on that girl,
your precious ring will end up just like this.
It's a fake!
Damn them! Treating me like dirt!
- Did he fall?
- Probably.
- Make sure.
- This isn't a place that one survives.
If we throw him down there, he'll die for sure.
- He's got the ring.
- I see.
Just you wait.
I'll tear your sneak thief to shreds.
400 years' worth of killings and corpses. Rest in peace.
KAWAKAMI GENNOSUKE, SPY FOR
THE IMPERIAL JAPANESE ARMY,
MET HIS END HERE IN 1904...
REVENGE
Lupin, give yourself up!
I'm glad you're all right, old man.
Tell me where the exit is.
How did you get here?
I was dropped down here, too.
Judging by the way you look,
I'd say you've been down here a while.
Shut up! I won't take pity from a thief.
Well, let's take it easy, seeing as how there's no way out.
Excuse me a moment.
Hey, give me alight, old man.
Lupin, just what the hell is it with all these corpses?
This is no burial ground.
Take a look at that wall.
Why, this is...
Rest in peace. Rest in peace!
I didn't think this was your average castle, but what secret would they go to these lengths to protect?
Hey! Is this what you're after?
That's what Fujiko's doing.
I hope she doesn't become a corpse.
Anyway, there's no use wasting our energy.
Good night, old man.
It's cold.
What's the situation?
Nothing yet.
All we can do is wait.
They're taking a long time.
Master Jodo!
Excellent.
Take that!
Beware! It's Lupin!
Huh?
These are coffins!
What is this?
These are 10,000-yen bills!
Is that what all of these are?
These are well-made.
Have a look, old man.
West German 1,000-mark bills.
Pounds! Dollars! Francs! Roubles!
Rupees! Pesos! Crowns! Lira!
Oh, and they've even got Won!
All the world's currencies!
Lupin, is this the secret of the castle?
Counterfeiting?
That's right.
This is the source of the Goat Money, which was valued above the real thing at one time.
Since the upheavals in Medieval Europe,
the mysterious counterfeit currency has been lurking in the shadows.
It ruined the Bourbon Dynasty and was the source of Napoleon's funds.
It also triggered the worldwide panic of 1927.
The Goat Money, the Black Hole, the star on the backstage of history.
All those that tried to eliminate the heart of the problem
were never heard from again.
I've hear the stories about it, but I never dreamed that an independent nation was running it.
What are you gonna do, old man?
You can't turn your back on it now that you've seen it.
I know.
It would shame my policeman's blood.
What say we make a temporary truce, until we get out of here?
Fine, but I won't aid and abet crooks.
I'll arrest you when we escape,
I guarantee it.
Terrific.
Let's have a proper shake on it.
- I won't get friendly with you.
- Good grief.
Miss Fujiko!
I came to say goodbye while I have the chance.
Who in the world are you?
I'm the only person in the castle who's allowed to serve you.
But in reality I'm a spy, searching for the secrets of this castle.
I'd intended to stay a bit longer, but Lupin's here, so I'm leaving now, because things are going to get all screwed up.
You know him?
So well that I've gotten sick of him.
Sometimes we're friends, sometimes we're enemies.
We've even been lovers.
He's a born womaniser. Take care.
Did he drop you?
No, silly. I dropped him.
There's smoke coming from the pit.
It's a fire!
It's coming from beneath the castle.
- Something's happened.
- It's started.
It's a fire! There's a fire!
It's bad. We think the fire originated in the cellar studio.
What? Put it out! Quickly!
Close that pane!
You men, get going too!
Does this mean you've bungled again, Jodo?
Hurry up, old man!
We're gonna have company soon.
Evidence. I need evidence!
Why, that damned Lupin!
Find them! They must still be in here!
Don't flinch. Charge!
It's Lupin! After him.
You put out the fire.
A Chapel!
- Lupin!
- Lupin! And Zenigata!
They're going to steal the autogyro.
- Fool
- Save the recriminations for later.
They're heading for Lady Clarisse.
Hurry!
Hurry UP!
Halt!
Don't try to make a fool of the police!
Hop on, old man.
So long!
I'm gonna make a quick detour, old man.
- What, kidnapping for ransom?
- There won't be a ransom.
He's coming this way.
Bullet-proof glass.
The window doesn't open.
Go, please! Don't worry about me.
Take the controls, old man.
What? Lupin, hold on!
I've never done this!
- Clarisse.
- Lupin!
I've come for you. Fujiko, a rope.
Don't talk so big.
Fujiko!
Come on, move it!
- Lupin!
- It's all right now.
Over here, old man, over here.
It doesn't go that smoothly, you idiot!
That's it! That's good!
Don't move, female rat.
Fujiko, I have plenty of questions to ask you after this.
Jodo, give Lupin his coup de grâce.
Yes, sir.
Stop! Don't shoot!
If you kill him, I'll die too.
Fire.
An attitude worthy of respect, Clarisse.
Get the ring and come here.
If you marry me,
I'll spare Lupin's life.
Or you can die with him now.
I'll do whatever you want.
Lupin, give me the ring.
No, Clarisse. You mustn't.
Check the back of his collar.
Lupin always hides things there.
Damn. Fujiko!
Here's the ring.
If you don't spare Lupin and Fujiko,
I'll throw it into the lake.
Trust me.
Put on the ring and come here.
- I'll shoot them.
- Wait until she brings us the ring.
Lupin!
Fire! Bring them down!
Cowardly sneak!
You said you'd spare them.
How could I let people who've seen the underground studio live to tell?
It's in my hand at last!
Lupin, I'll consider this a debt you owe me. So long.
We're retreating without getting our turn!
This thing is useless now. Jump!
I've cut another worthless object.
Don't think you can escape me, Lupin!
This is embarrassing, no matter what we do.
This is a conspiracy.
Please give me the order to move out.
This is clear proof.
I saw rows of modern printing presses.
We know all that!
This is a highly political issue.
Interpol's authority is limited to international crime.
- Sir, this is clearly a crime.
- You don't understand, do you?
That's a sovereign country, a United Nations member.
Interpol can't compel a criminal investigation of it.
Moreover, the situation is extremely damning.
Have you seen the front pages of the world's newspapers?
"The bravery of the Count, who himself protected his bride."
"Lupin kidnapping plot falls."
It's also said that Lupin's associate was disguised as Zenigata.
That was the real me!
This is embarrassing.
These police officers are imprudent.
I thought I'd reported the facts.
The issue at hand is, who will the general public believe?
We don't stand a chance.
The Count has numerous friends in Western political circles.
If the truth is revealed, numerous countries will be embarrassed.
There's evidence that large quantities of US currency were ordered by a certain nation.
Ha! Aren't these counterfeit roubles a CIA order?
Stop it! It's embarrassing to bring conflicts between nations in here.
I ask that you all return to your countries and consider the situation.
We're all set to go, Inspector.
We can leave for Cagliostro at any time.
- We're not going.
- Huh?
They'll arrange my replacement the moment I do go.
We'd be relieved of the Lupin assignment. Prepare to go back to Japan.
It's me. I brought food.
- Thanks.
- How is he?
His fever seems to have gone down, thanks to your treatment.
If you want to thank anyone, thank the dog.
That old dog won't leave him, and he doesn't take kindly to anybody.
If not for that,
I wouldn't have taken you in.
Hi, there, Karl.
He's awake. How's the wound, Lupin?
Jigen... Goemon...
It's been a long time, hasn't it?
A long time?
What are you talking about?
It's a temporary confusion of memory, due to his injuries.
Isn't your mistress with you today,
Karl?
How do you know that dog's name?
Only Lady Clarisse knows that his name is Karl, except for me.
Clarisse, I see.
Your mistress' name is Clarisse.
Clarisse...
Lupin?
Jigen. How long have I been out?
How many days has it been?
Three... Three days.
What? The wedding is tomorrow.
I've got to...
Take it easy.
You'll tear open your wound.
Food! Bring me food!
Food? You mean rice gruel?
I've lost a lot of blood. Anything will do. Just bring me lots of it.
Since you put it that way...
I'll see what I can find.
Hey, stupid, don't wolf it down like that. Your stomach won't put up with it.
Shut up! I'll be fine in twelve hours and going like a jet!
Well, I told you this would happen, didn't I?
What's that?
He'll sleep, now that he's eaten.
I see.
You're here on Lady Clarisse's behalf.
But with Lupin in the shape he's in now, well...
You seem to be on close terms with Miss Clarisse, sir.
I was the gardener for the manor.
As a child, Lady Clarisse loved trees and plants.
When the Archduke and Duchess passed away, she entrusted me with her dog and entered the convent.
And he picked up his mistress' scent on Lupin's body.
How do you suppose he knows the dog's name?
How should I know?
He's a hard man to figure out, period.
- That's not it.
- You awake?
It's been more than ten years now.
I was a greenhorn looking for fame and excitement.
As the capstone to my foolish ways,
I made an attempt on the Goat Money.
Somehow I made it to the shore, but I couldn't get myself to move any farther.
Karl? What is it, Karl?
It looked like my crimes were coming back to haunt me.
I brought you some water.
The ring shone brightly on the finger of the trembling hand with which she held the water.
I am ashamed of myself.
I'd completely forgotten about that until I saw the ring.
That's Fujiko's motorcycle.
It's from today's newspaper.
It says an Archbishop is coming from the Vatican tomorrow for the wedding.
'Quit!
Fujiko?
What? Lupin's going to the wedding?
For real?
You have authorisation to go if Lupin's involved, am I right?
I see! That's how I'll play it.
We're in a hurry! Clear the road!
There's no point.
The route ahead is jam-packed.
They say there's a landslide seven kilometres ahead.
Are there any other ways there?
We're going to be late!
Say, are you the Archbishop?
Ah, yes, indeed you are.
Please bless this kid of mine.
You're a local, aren't you? Are there any other ways to Cagliostro Castle?
There's a back road, if you want to take it.
Thanks a lot. Will you show us the way?
Please, get in.
Yes, yes. Anything for the Archbishop.
Put your backs into it!
Cagliostro's just over this next hill!
We've got to get there by sunset!
Is this a good idea, opening this up to TV?
It's His Highness' wish to demonstrate to the world that this is a legitimate wedding.
Look, the Archbishop has arrived.
Do you think Lupin will show up?
My Shadowmen guard the bride.
You men will protect the gates.
Yes, sir.
The time has come for Light and Shadow to reunite. Come, Clarisse.
Bring forth the evidence that you are the legitimate heirs of the noble, ancient bloodline of the Family Cagliostro.
In accordance with the ancient custom, the vow of your marriage will be the exchange of your rings.
Clarisse de Cagliostro, daughter of the Archduke of Cagliostro, do you agree to this wedding?
Silence will be taken as a reply of, "No objection."
God's blessing on you both.
Objection!
This wedding is full and running over with the filth of desire.
It's haunted!
Calm down.
The rat has revealed himself.
We have come as representatives of the dead in the underground dungeon.
We want the bride.
- This makes the ceremony impossible.
- Get back. It's a good side show.
I've come for you, Clarisse.
It's a demon! A devil! A monster!
Something incredible has just happened!
Lupin has appeared!
Stop broadcasting.
What are you doing?
Move out!
Clarisse! Clarisse!
Poor girl, you've been drugged, haven't you?
The damned Count's made you incapable of speech, hasn't he?
- Lupin!
- No! You mustn't go near him.
That was foolish, Lupin.
Take care of those others.
Clarisse. Don't cry, Clarisse.
Now, I will go to you there.
Does my present suit you, Count?
Your Highness!
This is the counterfeit money you've made. Take it as a price for the rings.
Damn!
Find him, he's got to be in there!
Thanks a lot.
You! You're Lupin!
Lupin!
Damn you!
I won't play around with you any longer.
Hey, Count Royal Blue, don't get so hot with jealousy. You'll get burned.
Lupin! Lupin! Lupin!
Thank you for waiting, ladies and gentlemen.
We're now back on the air.
All hell has broken loose in the ceremonial hall.
So long, Count.
Die!
After them! Don't let them escape!
Lupin has escaped!
The Count is angrily pursuing him!
Oh, the police have arrived!
Lupin's under the altar. Surround it.
Charge!
Zenigata's men are charging toward the altar.
Oh, it's the palace guards!
With Captain Gustav in the lead!
Cover the rear!
Don't retreat. Justice is on our side.
This is truly an intense battle!
What in the world could be under the altar?
It's a staircase!
There's a hole underground.
Could Lupin be down that hole?
Let's take our camera down there and see.
Lupin, you scum!
Lupin! Lupin!
What is that fool doing?
He's disregarding orders! Recall him!
It's too late!
This is a satellite broadcast!
Huh? What's this?
Looks like the Bureau of the Mint!
And over there, that's...
Oh, no! Japanese currency!
And it's counterfeit!
He's being deliberately theatrical.
This is a terrible discovery.
Look! Counterfeits of all the world's currencies.
While chasing Lupin, I discovered all this! What am I to do?
The first thing we'll do is escape the castle.
Jigen, Goemon, cover us.
Leave it to us.
We'll hold them off here.
Take care of yourselves, please.
You too, Mr Jigen.
What?
Please come back safely. I'll never forget your kindness as long as I live.
Go on, get out of here.
Hurry, Clarisse.
I'm coming.
She called me "Mr Jigen".
She's sweet.
Let's get started.
Zantetsuken has a different feel tonight.
That damned Lupin. He hasn't won yet.
- Please leave the castle to me.
- Right.
Does your wound hurt?
Not at all, not at all. It's nothing.
Come on, let's get over this thing.
Two goats, face to face.
There are Goat characters carved where the rings meet.
"Light and Shadow..." I can't read them very well. They're worn away.
"Replace us in the eyes of the high goat that faces the sun
"and tells the time that joins Light and Shadow."
Those words have been told in my family for a long time. Are they of any help?
Yes, yes, they've solved the mystery!
It's the Count. Come on, this way.
They're going to hide in the clock tower. Bring the ship alongside.
There they are.
Here they come.
Ouch!
This is no good.
Deactivate the lasers.
They can't get out.
- Scared?
- No.
Excellent. Here we go.
Don't let them get away!
Don't look.
We can't do it here.
- You men, use the stairs!
- Yes, sir.
Wait here, I'll block their way.
- Be careful.
- I'll be right back.
There he is.
Lupin! Behind you!
Well, hello, Count.
I'll skewer you, rat!
So it's the finale at last, eh, Count?
One more swing.
Hey, come over here, you rotten Count.
Lupin!
I'll take care of you first.
Run, Clarisse! I'll catch up to you!
How far will you go, Clarisse?
Here, here, what's wrong?
Can't you run any more?
This is the end of the Cagliostro bloodline. Die, Clarisse.
Hold it, Count. I've got a deal for you.
You're too late. Watch as she dies.
Listen to me.
I'll tell you the secret of the rings.
You can do whatever you want with them.
But forget about the girl. Let her go.
Look at the Goat on the clock face.
The Goat faces the sun and tells time.
There are holes in both eyes to put the rings in.
I'll give you the rings.
But if you kill her, I'll throw them in the lake, and kill you.
That's far enough. Send Clarisse in.
All right, very well.
Lupin, you should hold on to your trump card until the very end!
Come here!
Now these are the real thing.
I accept the rings.
Now accept my payment for the solution to the mystery.
Let go! Let go of me!
Clarisse!
Let go!
The clock tower!
Your Highness!
What is that?
This is the end of Cagliostro, too.
Kill me.
I don't take life carelessly.
- Lupin?
- Can you stand? Take a look.
This is the hidden treasure.
A Roman city was lying at the bottom of the lake.
When the Romans were chased away from the site, they built a lock and sunk it, and your ancestors claimed it in secret.
It's really a treasure for mankind.
Certainly too big for my pockets.
Interpol finally decided to do something.
Will you be going now?
Since all the old men have come, yes.
Take me with you.
I can't be a thief yet, but I'll learn.
Please, take me! I want to go with you.
Clarisse...
Don't talk stupid. Do you want to go back into the darkness again?
You've come out into the sun at last.
Hey, your life begins now.
Don't become filthy like me.
I'll tell you what, if you're ever in trouble,
I'll fly straight to you no matter when, even if I'm on the other side of the world.
Karl!
Lady Clarisse!
Old friend!
"Lupin!
"30 long!
My lady!
Lupin!
Take care, Clarisse. Goodbye.
Thank you, everyone. Goodbye.
Goodbye! Goodbye!
Damn, I was a step too slow.
Lupin pulled off his theft.
No, he didn't steal anything.
He fought for me.
No, ma'am.
He stole something of no small value.
Your heart.
Yes, he did.
Well, then, I must be going.
Chase Lupin!
Chase him to the ends of the earth!
What nice people.
I feel as if I've known him all my life.
Lupin, I know we'll never meet again.
She's a nice girl.
You can stay here.
Fujiko!
Lupin, look at my trophies.
The counterfeit plans!
Hey, hey! Let's be friends.
So long!
Hey! Hey, may! Wait a second!
Oh, no, it's the old man again.
Lupin! I'll get you for sure this time!
The End.
