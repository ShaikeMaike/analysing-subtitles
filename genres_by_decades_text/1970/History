Can you pick me up, Steiner?
Steiner, can you hear me?
Steiner.
- Good kill!
- Beautiful.
Look, my new weapon.
- Get one for yourself. 
- Some ammunition.
- Give him a hand.
- Of course.
Look at that!
- Nothing we haven't seen before.
- Steiner.
Look what I found running around in the back. A little Russian fledgling.
Put it down.
Quickly!
We go.
See if you can get Meyer. Tell him we'll need transportation from checkpoint seven.
Right, sir.
Bring him with us.
Push, push, push, push, push!
Come on, come on! Quickly!
All right, stop.
This damned country!
Once it was a new adventure, but I have a feeling that one of these days, this land will swallow us up.
Captain Stransky, sir.
- Colonel Brandt. You're welcome.
- Thank you, sir.
This is my adjutant, Captain Kiesel.
Captain, how are you?
Thank you for asking, Captain.
I feel terrible. I've got diarrhea.
How are you?
You should meet your own adjutant.
Lieutenant Triebig.
He's also a new arrival.
Won't you join us in a glass of wine?
Oh, that's very kind of you, sir.
Take my coat, please.
Yes, sir.
My respects, Colonel. A 1937 Mosel in the southernmost corner of Russia.
Remarkable!
A bottle of Mosel is no more out of place in this region than we are ourselves.
Your health, gentlemen.
I'm not going to drink to my health.
It's not worth drinking to.
To the end of the war?
Colonel, why does our presence here strike you as so absurd?
Captain, why did you ask to be relieved from duty in France?
I want to get the iron Cross.
We could give you one of mine.
No, no, I'm just joking.
Actually it's exactly what my commanding officer in France asked me.
"L can't stop you," he said.
"Since I'm convinced that without you the Eastern Front"
"would collapse in a matter of days."
"Go ahead, you heroic horse's ass."
"Heroic horse's ass." His exact words.
I withdraw my toast to the end of the war.
To heroic horse's asses everywhere.
To the patient foolish.
Colonel, I would like to make something quite clear to Captain Kiesel.
I volunteered for this campaign because
I feel that men of quality are needed here.
It is time to destroy the myth of Russian invincibility.
Just how do we do that?
Bolstering morale, punishing those who are insubordinate and rebellious.
Instilling a new respect for ranking officers.
Low morale goes hand in hand with defeat after defeat followed by impending defeat.
Now you are new to our Russian front, so I don't blame you for talking like a horse's ass.
Of course, sir, I'm not familiar with the Russian front yet, but I firmly don't believe that the ideals of the German soldier even...
The German soldier no longer has any ideals.
He's not fighting for the culture of the West, not for one form of government that he wants, and not for the stinking party.
He's fighting for his life. God bless him.
Well, sir, I am a soldier, and as a soldier,
I feel it is my duty to subordinate my own ideas to the principles of my country, right or wrong.
Colonel Brandt, Lieutenant Meyer, sir.
- Yes?
- Steiner's on his way back.
- What sort of shape are they in?
- The usual!
Very well, I see.
I want a briefing as soon as they're rested.
- Yes, sir.
- And, Meyer, Captain Stransky is here.
See that he is informed of our situation.
Yes, sir.
- Steiner's back.
- Of course.
Who's Steiner?
To you, in some ways, he could be a problem.
But he's a first-rate soldier.
So, we look the other way.
Anything to add to that, Kiesel?
Steiner is a myth.
But men like him are our last hope.
And in that sense, he's truly a very dangerous man.
Well, I will see.
Colonel, with your permission.
Well, what do you think of our new captain?
I feel he thinks he is on some kind of special mission, that is, to achieve spiritual domination of his battalion, thereby symbolizing the purity of the great German Wehrmacht itself.
Even when going down in defeat.
If they're the last of us, Stransky and Steiner, then God help us.
Medic!
Medic! Medic!
Captain Stransky, welcome to the second platoon.
- Lieutenant.
- Meyer, Captain.
I am to show you to your quarters, brief you on our current situation.
- Where's my bunker?
- Down there, in front of the factory, sir.
- The second platoon is guarding your post.
- Where are they?
They're just returning from reconnaissance, sir.
- Who's in charge of it?
- Corporal Steiner, sir.
Oh.
What is so special about this Corporal Steiner?
Early in the Novorossiysk attack,
Corporal Steiner saved Colonel Brandt's life.
And mine, too.
Interesting.
Corporal Steiner!
I'm Captain Stransky.
I'm your new commander here.
Yes, sir.
Who's this?
Corporal Schnurrbart, sir.
And the other one?
That is a Russian prisoner, sir.
You know as well as I do that there are orders that no Russian prisoners are to be taken.
Get rid of him.
How, sir?
Well, shoot him!
You shoot him, sir.
I will. On the spot.
And then I'll deal with you.
No need. I'll see that it's taken care of, sir.
I want to see you in my bunker. One hour.
With your full report.
- Clear?
- Of course, sir.
- You already drank both the vodka.
- I'm using it for the cooking.
Oh, shit.
- Corporal Steiner?
- I'm Lily Marlene.
Come here, son.
Steiner!
I want to show you what our new army looks like.
- What's your name, son?
- Private Dietz, sir.
They're sending us babies now.
Hello, child.
Private Dietz.
How long have you been soldiering?
Six weeks, sir. I volunteered, sir.
Don't volunteer for anything around here.
Just keep your eye on Krüger here, and myself.
Do exactly as we say or you'll be wearing boots up your ass for a long time.
- Clear?
- Yes, sir!
- And don't call me sir.
- Excuse me.
Go with this foul-smelling one over here.
Put him in Schiller's bunk.
Kern, see if you can find a jacket or a blanket, something for the boy.
Get Schiller's jacket.
He must have something over there.
Yes, sir! Oh, excuse me.
Stand at ease.
Thank you, sir.
- My report.
- Thank you.
I regret the incident this afternoon, Corporal.
But orders are orders.
We have enough trouble with the feeding of our own troops without taking prisoners.
Anyway, it's very bad for security.
I've read your preliminary report, and it gives me great pleasure to inform you that
Colonel Brandt and I have agreed to recommend you for promotion to Senior Sergeant, effective at once.
Your promotion doesn't seem to have made much of an impression.
No, it doesn't.
All right.
I've read your report. Anything to add to this?
Russians, sir. We should be hearing from them very soon, sir.
- An offensive?
- Yes, I should think so, sir.
- Starting when?
- Soon.
- What about your platoon?
- Two killed, one missing.
Two killed, how?
Bullets. Mortar fire. Artillery.
Heavy salvos. Bad luck.
Terminal syphilis. The usual things, Captain.
The missing man, did you look for him, Steiner?
- No, sir.
- Why not?
I felt that it would be irresponsible of me to risk the safety of the entire platoon for the sake of one man.
You felt what?
A non-commissioned officer does not permit a missing man in such a case, in any case!
I'll try to do better next time, sir.
- I'd like to have that in writing.
- If you wish.
You know, Corporal... Sergeant,
I have a feeling you somewhat overestimate your importance.
At the moment,
I am free of any such illusions, sir.
Well, may I suggest to you that you do not underestimate your present company.
Everything you are and may become is dependent upon this present company.
No, I will not forget that, sir.
But I may add that a man is generally what he feels himself to be.
Of course.
You're dismissed.
I shall be back soon, sir.
Is that a salute?
Yes, sir.
- Triebig.
- Yes, sir.
You must be careful, Steiner.
He's taken a strong dislike to you.
I'll survive.
You're not dealing with just another Nazi Party type.
This one is pure Prussian military aristocracy and rich.
Hey, why are you bringing in the apples?
To eat, you overgrown idiot.
You know the ruling classes?
Come now, Lieutenant, what's left for them to rule?
Don't be naive.
Stransky will survive this war one way or another.
And he'll still have his land, his wealth, and his status.
But he'll be very dangerous in defeat.
Be careful with him.
He doesn't live in the same world we live in.
No, he's living in my world now.
Yeah, sure.
- Lieutenant?
- Yeah?
Please, would you come inside for a minute?
There's something I'd like to show you.
Kern, don't just stand there drinking, help us!
Thank you. I didn't realize that you knew.
Oh, you forget we are a reconnaissance platoon.
Happy birthday, Lieutenant Meyer.
- Yes!
- Happy birthday!
Explain everything to the Captain's orderly, so he doesn't make any mistakes, will you?
And take care of your uniform.
He's rather strict about it.
Russian vodka, German wine, chickens.
Oh, Maag, I don't know how we have stayed alive so long!
He's the best scavenger in the entire regiment.
- Cheers to all of you.
- Cheers!
Here's to the last Russian bullet.
Yeah!
Here's to survival.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah!
Here's to your wife, girlfriend, women!
Yeah! Women!
Here's to the women of the Folies-Bergère.
To the girls of the Reeperbahn!
Gently, gently.
Here's to Dietz's virginity.
Play your cards right and we'll introduce you to Triebig.
All you have to do is just bend over.
Here comes the cake.
Oh, cake!
Captain Stransky should see this.
- Captain who?
- Here's to the cake.
Cake! Here's to the cake!
Stop it! Stop it!
What are we doing here?
What do you think we are doing here?
Playing birthday games?
Right in the middle of all that shit!
- Come on...
- You shut up when I'm talking!
If you want a party, okay, drink.
Get drunk. Okay?
- Take it easy.
- There's a bullet for you, too.
- For all of you arseholes!
- Come on!
You, arsehole. You don't touch me.
You stink like a shithole.
Come on.
Let's not spoil everything.
This is Lieutenant Meyer's birthday.
Happy birthday, Lieutenant.
Have a good party.
- I'll have some more vodka.
- Here, fill it up.
Yeah, here's some vodka for everybody.
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
All right, now.
Lieutenant Meyer is to have a meeting with our illustrious new commandant,
Captain Stransky, whom you'll all meet shortly.
This is not a funeral, gentlemen.
This is a birthday party.
Now let's drink.
We'll have a song, what the hell.
Thank you, sir.
Where were you stationed before you joined the battalion?
In the South of France. Biarritz.
I know it well. Sit down.
Sit down. Tell me about it.
It's such a beautiful country.
And being transferred must have come hard, hmm?
I applied for it as you did, sir.
As I did?
That's interesting.
And your orderly?
- We served together.
- In the South of France!
Those French girls!
Those French girls, Triebig!
I did not have much time to think about those French girls.
Really? And you, Keppler?
Did you enjoy the French girls?
On occasion.
Let me ask you a question, Triebig.
Do you like soldiering?
Certainly, I like it, sir.
But it's strange at times.
It is indeed a very different world.
A world of danger, and a world of men.
A world without women, hmm, Keppler?
- Yes.
- A world without women.
Thank you.
It's an old theory of mine.
Men can get along without women easily, easily, I tell you.
A man's true destiny is not just breeding children, all this childbirth, and chocolate, but to be free, to rule and to fight.
In other words, to lead a man's existence, women are no more than a nuisance.
Sometimes... Sometimes necessary.
I'm a soldier, sir.
If I have to, I can do without women.
Really?
And you, Keppler?
Can you do without women?
I do as I am ordered, sir.
I like that! I like that answer.
"L do as I am ordered." I like that.
What is your first name?
Josef.
Josef, Josef.
If it will help you,
I'll put your thoughts into the right words.
You prefer the society of men to that of women at any and all situations.
Right?
I don't understand, Captain.
Come on, Triebig.
You don't have to put up a front with me.
With me of all people.
What I said was right, wasn't it?
You prefer the society of men to that of women.
Come on, we're all soldiers.
There's no harm in it.
Say yes, for heaven's sake, man, say yes!
Possibly.
You said yes.
You said yes!
He said yes, didn't he, Keppler? He said yes!
You said yes. Didn't he, Keppler?
He said yes, didn't he, Keppler?
- Yes.
- Louder!
Didn't he, Keppler? Louder! Say yes, loud!
Yes!
- Louder!
- Yes!
I can assure you of this, if you get caught, you'll be hanged slowly, both of you.
Together.
Now get out of here.
Ammunition supply's running low.
Sector three needs more nine millimeter.
Steiner's platoon all secure.
Perimeter taking light mortar shelling.
Section Z47, no casualties.
By the way, we didn't get the mail.
That's a big one... Thank you.
Oh, I see.
Take your hands off my lice.
- Merde!
- Oh, not again!
Belch before farting, that's the rule.
Sector seven, no activity.
Get him outside.
Kern, get yourself outside. Come on, quick.
No, no, no, the Russians might think it's mustard gas.
The Geneva Convention forbids the use of mustard gas.
God damn it, Kern!
What type of exhaust pipe do you have and when was it broken?
I'm well-organized and without problems.
Are you equally guilty?
Krüger, is that your natural smell?
Listen, idiots,
I stay dirty for a reason.
If you'd been in the field for as long as I have been, you'd know why.
Explain.
I learned after Stalingrad.
Natural body oils combined with dirt can keep you waterproof.
Waterproof?
Sure.
How goes it?
Quiet.
Too quiet.
Yes.
They'll wait till first light.
Rolf, what are we doing here?
We are spreading the German culture throughout a desperate world.
Didn't someone say that war is the highest expression in life for the truly cultured people?
Yes, a foolish wise man named
Friedrich von Bernhardi.
- Right!
- Yeah!
- And Von Clausewitz said...
- Von Clausewitz?
Von Clausewitz said,
"War is a continuation of state policy."
"By other means!"
Yes, by other means.
Do you ever think about your children, Rolf?
- Always.
- Where are they?
I don't know.
Take off one uniform, there's always another one underneath.
Go!
It's all an accident.
An accident of hands.
Mine, others.
All without mind.
One extreme to another, and neither works.
Nor will ever!
Here we stand in the middle, in no-man's land, you and I.
Go home.
Go home!
Steiner!
- Yes, sir?
- Is it a probe, Stransky?
A probe, sir? It's an avalanche!
No, sir! It's an attacking force!
Sir, counter-fire is needed at once.
Otherwise, we'll be destroyed.
We're overrun! Move out!
I need help!
Be calm, Stransky. You are not alone.
What do you mean I'm not alone, sir?
I am alone! I am alone!
Steiner is gone, Triebig is gone,
I don't know where Lieutenant Meyer is.
I don't know! Is he dead?
- Then go to your second platoon...
- Is he dead?
Salient sector and find them!
And stand by and prepare the counterattack as quickly as possible.
Yes, sir! I will be counterattacking, sir!
Stay in your positions!
Hello? I will be counterattacking.
Get some more ammunition!
- Where's my weapon?
- On the wall, sir.
Get that ammunition!
Keep down, you fool!
You, get over there!
Get back to your post!
- Get that phone fixed.
- Yes, sir.
Get back there, damn you!
Keep your positions!
Everybody, keep firing!
Fall out, men! Fall out!
I need air cover!
Fire!
We're winning. We're winning!
Where's my air cover? Where are my tanks?
Shit!
The phone is ringing! Where's the phone?
Fire!
- Captain Stransky.
- Where's your counterattack?
We are attacking! We are defending!
We're counterattacking!
I'm wounded, sir. But I continue.
I know my duty, sir. Don't worry.
But I need ammunition!
Lieutenant Meyer!
Hollerbach! We must cover Steiner!
Look at me.
Follow the light with your eyes.
Very good.
That's it. Now look at me again.
Sergeant!
All right.
Did you sleep well?
Reasonably.
Smell?
Nothing.
Any sense of taste?
Improving.
Quite usual in concussion.
You've been like this for a week.
They should return soon.
Your records indicate multiple wounds over the last few years.
Any residual effects?
Headaches.
Blurred vision.
I can't urinate out of my left ear any longer, but otherwise I feel rather well.
The doctors recommend that you stay with us for another three weeks until they've completed your tests.
Then they recommend home leave.
Home.
Schnurrbart? Schnurrbart?
Attention! General Von Hessel!
Hello, soldier? How are you?
Tell me, how do you feel?
This man has severe concussion, sir.
He's been highly decorated.
I want 65 % of these men returned to active duty in three days.
Food!
Delicious!
Take the pig, the meat and the wine into the private dining room.
Come! Eat! Eat, eat, everybody! Everybody!
Vegetables are good for you.
They're with the compliments of the High Command.
Everybody looks like someone else around here.
Did I have a bad spell?
Yeah, you were very violent.
Violent?
Violence should stop. It must stop.
You say the violence must stop?
Oh, no, I'm on duty.
- Have a drink.
- No, I couldn't.
They'll throw me out.
Do you dance?
Hold my bottle. I'll hold your waist.
And we dance.
Listen, this is ridiculous.
It's nice.
Schnurrbart!
Rolf?
What the hell are you doing here? Lost?
No such luck, Rolf.
I got it in the leg same time you got it in the head.
Schnurrbart!
My vacation's over.
It's back to the bad side of old mother Russia.
They took us all from our hospital.
It looks like we're picking up some of your boys as well.
You want to come along or are you doing all right?
Attention, men! Prepare to leave.
Corporal! Hold this truck.
What the hell are you talking about?
That's an order, God damn it!
- Rolf?
- What?
- What is it?
- What?
What's the matter?
I'm going back.
I thought you were going back home.
I have no home.
My home.
Our home.
Do you love the war so much?
Is that...
Is that what's wrong with you, Steiner?
Or are you afraid of what you will be without it?
Long live Germany.
I said to hold it, right?
Steiner, I didn't mean it. You're crazy!
Schnurrbart.
Rolf!
Son of a bitch!
- Schnurrbart!
- Hello, Kern!
- Hello, Hartwig.
- Hello, Sergeant.
- Hartwig!
- Schnurrbart, how are you?
Caught with your pants down again?
Anselm.
Welcome back, Sergeant.
- Hollerbach!
- Rolf, hello.
Good to have you back, Schnurrbart.
Krüger!
You're back too soon.
I don't want to talk to you.
Leave me alone.
Get your ass out of there, you old pirate.
I missed you. I missed you! Yeah.
My, my, my! What is this?
- That's Zoll.
- That's a Party member Zoll.
With compliments of Captain Stransky.
S.S. Special Action Squad.
You still a Party member,
Hollerbach?
Well, Rolf, I'd dance with the party if I could find one.
Hey, silence. The Party's convinced we are winning the war.
Yeah, sure, we're winning the war.
I hope you've memorized our serial numbers, our mothers' maiden names correctly.
I wouldn't want the Gestapo to come and arrest the wrong man, woman or child.
I don't care what you believe, or what you've done.
Your duty is to us, the platoon and me.
Fulfill those responsibilities or you will have a bayonet up your ass.
- Clear?
- Yes, sir.
I am playing nursemaid to the third squad, any volunteers?
- Not me.
- No chance.
- Go alone this time.
- Enjoy yourself.
Thanks a lot.
What have we here, a hawk and a hare, eh?
I'll take you.
Come on, have a drink.
- That's your bottle.
- Cheers, Rolf.
Give me that thing. Come on.
Gentlemen.
Cheers.
Some papers for you to sign, Captain.
I'll sign them later.
Stop that! Be careful with my J.J.
Yes, sir.
Have her treated correctly.
- Sergeant Steiner reporting as ordered, sir.
- Come in.
Thank you. That will be all, gentlemen.
- Welcome back, Sergeant Steiner.
- Thank you, sir.
Please sit down. Make yourself comfortable.
Well, now that you're back, and I'm glad you're back.
I think we should make a fresh start together.
But the main point is the regiment feels or believes that I deserve the iron Cross now.
And they've asked me to produce two witnesses to the fact that I led the counterattack and threw the Russians out of their positions.
I have named Lieutenant Triebig and you.
Especially you.
Lieutenant Triebig has already submitted his signature.
Am I to believe this is a private conversation?
That would occur to you, wouldn't it?
All right, have some wine, a '36 Mosel.
I'll have some.
Thank you, Sergeant.
But still remember that in civilian as well as in military life the distinction is made between people.
Is that what you meant when you said,
"All you are and may become"
"is dependent upon this present company?"
Well, the difference is a matter of ethical and intellectual superiority which is caused, whether you like it or not, by blood and by class difference.
If I remember correctly Kant was the son of a saddle maker and Schubert's father was a poor schoolmaster.
Perhaps talent, sensitivity and character are no longer privileges of the so-called upper class.
But Kant and Schubert were exceptions.
We're talking about general concepts,
- not individuals.
- But I am one and so are you.
Didn't your führer say that all class distinctions were to be abolished?
I'm an officer of the Wehrmacht.
I've never been a Party member.
I'm a Prussian aristocrat and I don't want to be put into the same category!
So we agree for once.
Good.
But he is still our führer.
Unfortunately.
Oh...
That is a different question, Sergeant.
That's not up to us to judge.
Why do you want it so badly?
It's just a piece of worthless metal.
Look!
It's not worthless to me.
Why is it so important to you?
Tell me, Captain, why?
Sergeant, if I go back without the iron Cross
I couldn't face my family.
Personally, sir, I don't feel you deserve the iron Cross.
Incoming!
Where are you going?
I'm going to point 124.
Corporal Krüger's over there.
Are you crazy?
No one could survive this kind of assault.
Get out of my way, God damn it.
I'm going after him.
Steiner!
You get me some stretcher-bearers, damn it.
Steiner! Steiner!
The others?
Dead, all dead.
Oh, God. Listen to me.
We are going to leave now.
Will you get up and follow me out of here?
All right?
Three hours.
Three hours I've been here by myself.
I don't ever want to be alone again.
You won't, you won't.
Come on.
Why the hell wasn't I told of Steiner's return to the battalion?
My apologies for that, sir.
There were more important things to do.
I want him here at once.
About a predicament of which I am sure you don't need to be reminded.
- Clear, Stransky?
- Quite clear, sir.
Now we shall see.
I don't like the tone of his voice.
I'm fed up with the whole situation.
Well, it doesn't matter anymore.
I know from reliable sources that headquarters have already written off the Kuban bridgehead.
And soon the whole Crimea will be a cul-de-sac.
Report to Brandt.
If you have the choice, Triebig, between Biarritz and Siberia, what would you choose?
- Steiner.
- Colonel.
Sit down please, Steiner.
How was hospital?
Oh, interesting.
I recommend it.
Did Captain Stransky lead the counterattack the day Lieutenant Meyer was killed?
Lieutenant Meyer led the attack.
Captain Stransky was nowhere in sight.
You're sure of that.
I saw Lieutenant Meyer die.
Fetch Triebig.
Stay, I want you to listen.
Sir?
You signed your Captain's report.
Were you present when Captain Stransky led the counterattack?
I accompanied Captain Stransky to the field and saw him calling several men around him.
Then he sent me back to the command post.
Then how do you know that Captain Stransky led the counterattack?
You've signed a statement to that effect, Triebig.
I wasn't there. I learned of it from wounded men who were returning.
Can you give me the name of one of these wounded men?
They were not staff men, just company men.
I knew them only by sight.
Besides, the smoke, the battle.
We had been under fire, sir.
I want you to know, Triebig, that I have had your statement checked.
Captain Kiesel will inform you of the results of our investigation.
Our investigation so far has disclosed that the men in the second company who took part in the action declared unanimously that the action was led by Lieutenant Meyer.
None of them saw Captain Stransky or Lieutenant Triebig.
To my mind there is nothing more contemptible than stealing the laurels which properly belong to a man who was killed in action.
If Sergeant Steiner stands by his last testimony,
I should be compelled to institute disciplinary proceedings against the Captain and you.
Yes, sir.
Do you stand by your statement that Captain Stransky was not with the company?
Would it be possible for me to give my answer in three or four days, sir?
Did you see Stransky or not?
You may go, Triebig.
You're no longer needed.
What in God's name has got into you?
This is your chance!
You are the only person that stands between Stransky and his iron Cross.
And you could be called as a primary witness against him in a court of honor.
My differences with Captain Stransky are a personal matter.
Now listen to me.
You know that I've always shown a great deal of understanding for you, but I'm becoming tired of battling with your superiors.
I never ask you to.
Didn't ask me to!
You never asked me to?
Are you out of your mind?
Steiner, why are you so ungrateful?
What do I have to be grateful for, Captain?
Your tolerance?
Do you think that just because you and Colonel Brandt are more enlightened than most officers that I hate you any less?
I hate all officers, all the Stranskys, all the Triebigs, all the iron Cross scavengers in the whole German army.
Have you any idea what you're saying?
Do you know how much I hate this uniform and everything it stands for?
God!
Get out.
Please, just get out.
Regimental headquarters.
Division headquarters, sir.
General Von Kellinshofe.
Colonel Brandt.
Yes, General.
Yes, sir. I didn't know it was as bad as that.
I am very sorry to hear it.
Well?
We're pulling back to the bridgehead at Kuban.
No rear guard. Not even Steiner's platoon.
We're not retreating. We're running.
Captain Stransky. Yes, Captain Kiesel.
I was just about to leave.
Don't leave just yet. Now listen to me.
Regiment feels that it is unwise and also suicidal to leave behind any rear guard platoons including Steiner's.
I want them to join the evacuation immediately.
You understand that?
Yes, Captain.
Triebig?
All real guard platoons to join the evacuation immediately.
Shall I notify Steiner's platoon?
Yes.
Give me Steiner.
Calling Regiment.
Regimental headquarters. Come in, please!
Regimental headquarters! Come in, please!
Regimental headquarters. Come in, please!
B Company, can you hear me?
Anybody come in, please!
Tanks!
Captain Stransky, can you hear me?
Krüger!
All the lines are out.
Better get 'em out!
Down the tunnel!
Out!
Go into the factory.
Get everything?
Fire!
Zoll, grab some mines. Bring them up. Quick!
On the tracks, Zoll.
Put them on the tracks.
Hurry! Move!
Heads down.
Into the factory. Over to the factory!
Move, damn it!
Maag, they're coming in from both sides.
Kern, up above!
Krüger, get up on the gangwalk! Hurry.
Quick! Down the tunnel!
Anselm! The grenade! Come here!
Throw it!
Shit! Jesus Christ!
Steiner, let's go!
It's clear.
Dietz. Cover for us.
Hurry! Move!
- Captain Pucher reporting, sir.
- Yes, Captain.
You have your orders?
And a letter for you to be delivered personally.
Thank you.
You can guess what this is, can't you?
- A transfer.
- Exactly.
Our Stransky is to report to Paris within a week.
Captain Pucher, my orderly will see to your billeting.
But don't unpack everything.
We might be going away.
Captain.
Stransky.
Without Steiner to contradict him, he'll get his iron Cross and strut all around Paris.
The arrogant, unbloodied bastard.
Stransky in Paris and Steiner...
God knows where he'll be.
It seems there's...
What, 22, 23 kilometers between... here and Anapa.
Marshland. Wilderness.
It's the same trap behind the Russian lines.
Again shit, again shit, again shit...
Here take your gun.
Again shit, again shit, again shit...
We'll try the road.
Hey, we'll never get over this road.
What's your hurry, kid?
We'll get out of this mess in time for the next one.
Steiner! Steiner, it's clear now.
Let's go. Move it, move it!
Anselm, move your ass!
The cattle cars or whatever they're sending are due to arrive at 1200 hours, provided, of course, that the Russian sappers have not blown up the track.
- Any questions?
- No, sir.
Dismissed.
Carry on probing and aggressive actions all along the front.
They're not listening.
You, too.
I beg your pardon?
Who needs a railroad track?
When we break out of here, we'll push on with a blitzkrieg through Stalingrad and up to the outskirts of Moscow.
What will we do when we lose the war?
Prepare for the next one.
Do you think he'll get through?
Steiner?
I don't see how he can.
Anselm, go bring Zoll in.
- What is it?
- Bridge.
Just bring what you need to kill with.
- It's a game.
- A game?
It's a kid's game.
It's bad luck to step on sunlight.
I thought perhaps if I miss the beams we would all come through this all right.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Over there, get in the corner.
Jesus Christ!
Get these weapons out of here!
Krüger, upstairs! Schnurrbart, perimeter.
Check the other buildings.
Come here. Get in that corner.
Get in that room.
Come on, pretty rabbit.
Don't hide from me.
Check the radio, and get that body out of here.
Anselm.
- Stay there!
- Get your hands off.
Anselm, stop it, damn it!
- Anselm! Anselm!
- Leave me, Steiner.
Wait. Stop it!
Stop your fucking silly game!
This isn't a brothel!
This is a war!
Rolf, look what I found.
I said get that body out of here.
Everything clear out here.
What is this?
It shows their basic positions in front of Anapa.
Good.
Means we're halfway home.
Thank the ladies and tell them to take their clothes off.
And what shall we do with the bodies?
Who's gonna keep them warm?
- Tell them we want their tunics and trousers.
- We are going to die anyway.
- Do it! Do it!
- We are going to die anyway. Let me...
Let me keep one.
Major.
Major!
She's dead.
- Dietz, Zoll, watch them.
- Yeah.
The rest of you, put these uniforms on.
Come on, get over there with the rest of them.
Pick up your weapons.
Up, up, out!
Get that uniform and take it inside.
Oh, shit.
Go over there.
Come on, pick it up.
You want to play? All right.
That's a nice little girl.
That's it.
Come on.
I'll give you something to play with.
I'm gonna be busy for a while.
Come on.
How would you like it?
That's nice.
Steiner!
Oh, Dietz.
Jesus Christ.
Dietz.
Oh, God. God.
Don't... hurt the girl.
Do you believe in God, Sergeant?
I believe God is a sadist but probably doesn't even know it.
Zoll!
Stupid man!
Steiner! God!
Take the women outside. With me.
Come on. Go!
Move out! Come on!
All of you get inside. Inside!
Steiner!
Now we're even.
And there's one other thing you could do for me.
There's a man here that I would like to get out quickly.
I spoke to you about him before.
If there is a chance that he could leave with your headquarter staff,
I will be most grateful. Thank you, sir.
They're rolling up both flanks.
It's chaos.
That need no longer concern you.
You're to report at once to General Headquarters.
You're being evacuated.
I can't leave the Command, sir.
While I'm still in a condition to issue orders, those orders will be obeyed.
I'm prepared to disobey that order, sir.
You've been around Steiner too long.
Come, listen to me for a moment.
For many of us Germans, the exterminator is long overdue.
But I have decided that you are worth saving.
But I'm part of all this.
There are better people than me.
Most of them are being killed out there.
There's nothing wrong with you except that you smoke too much.
You're a brave man.
Braver than you think you are.
One of these days there will be a need for brave civilians.
Had you thought of that?
In the new Germany, if such a thing is allowed to exist, there will be a need for builders, for thinkers...
For poets.
I begin to see now what your job is to be.
I will make this my final order to you.
You will search out and contact all of these... better people, you call them?
And together you'll take on the responsibility that goes with survival.
Now you must leave.
Please leave.
Braun, take Captain Kiesel to the railhead!
Go.
Steiner, how do we get through the Russian trenches?
It's only a matter of time.
They'll be building them for a thousand years.
- If not here, somewhere else.
- Not Germany.
Germany.
Do you think they'll ever forgive us for what we've done?
Or forget us?
We'll make it. We will make it with your help.
To tell you the truth I'm...
I'm beginning to enjoy it.
Well, you want... to be sitting in some mud hole some place, waiting for the top of your head to be blown off?
At least here we're free.
Steiner.
Steiner?
Sing it!
Go! Go!
Here, Sergeant. Here's your weapon.
Then all we have to do is hope our own artillery doesn't get us.
Or the landmines.
Two hundred meters to go.
Anselm.
- Yes?
- Try to raise somebody on that radio.
Tell them we're coming in at dawn.
We need a password. What's...
What's the password?
Reconnaissance Patrol with several Russian prisoners and no shooting.
Password, Krüger, God damn it!
"Demarcation."
Why not? "Demarcation."
"Demarcation." Sign it Steiner.
Captain, special password "Demarcation."
Signed Steiner.
Coming in with prisoners.
Looks like a trap.
My thoughts exactly, sir.
He may have been captured.
- Wolf.
- Sir?
Did you recognize the voice?
No, sir, it was in code.
Good code, "Demarcation."
Triebig...
If in the dark, you saw half a dozen men, some in Russian uniforms, advancing on you.
Could anyone blame you if you opened fire?
No.
Will you check the situation for me and, take care of it?
You do like Biarritz, don't you?
You do like the South of France, don't you?
Come on.
Oh, shit!
- Kern.
- Yeah.
You and I will carry the weapons.
The rest of you make sure your hands are clearly placed behind your heads.
I'll go first, Sergeant.
No, Goddamit, Schnurrbart.
There might be some asshole who didn't know what the message is.
No, I go.
Rolf!
You've been responsible for all of us.
This time I'm responsible for you.
Take us in.
Sir, look here.
Welcome, Sergeant Steiner.
My passage home.
Steiner!
Demarcation! Steiner!
Steiner, we're coming out!
- Demarcation!
- Demarcation!
Steiner's coming in!
Demarcation!
Demarcation!
Barrage!
Russians right in front.
Schnurrbart, move out!
Stand by to fire.
Go, go!
Fire!
Demarcation!
It's Steiner!
It's a trap. Fire!
No!
God damn it!
Sir, they look like prisoners.
Steiner!
There are German soldiers with them.
- Stop it!
- Stop it!
The fucking idiots.
We're German soldiers...
Fire!
Stop it!
Stop it!
No!
- Keep firing!
- Stop, God damn it!
Fire!
Oh, my God!
It's Steiner!
You, stop!
Go get my men, go!
- Stop it!
- Stretcher-bearers.
Bloody Nazi swine!
Swine!
It's all Stransky's orders!
I had no part in it.
We're sorry.
He's dead.
I had no part in it!
I'm Private Dietz, sir.
You're on your own.
If I don't find you, join up with another outfit, another platoon.
A deserter. I don't care.
It doesn't matter anymore.
Where are you going?
To pay my debts.
You are our platoon leader!
This thing isn't over yet.
You're the new platoon leader.
And Anselm is your platoon.
That should make you happy, you old pirate.
Steiner! Steiner!
Steiner!
Yes, Colonel Brandt?
Situation is worsening here. You're needed.
If my orders are here...
And they are here, sir, then my replacement is already with the Company.
You may leave, Stransky.
Your Triebig is dead.
It didn't work, Captain.
I live.
You are dead.
Lieutenant Triebig has not been under my command for several hours.
- He has been transferred.
- You aristocratic... pile of Prussian pig shit!
Leaving without your iron Cross, Captain?
Just a matter of time.
Where's the rest of your platoon?
I said, "Where's the rest of your platoon,"
Sergeant Steiner!
You are...
Captain Stransky.
You are the rest of my platoon.
- Know how to use it?
- Yes, of course.
Fine, I accept.
I'll show you how a Prussian officer can fight.
And I'll show you where the iron Crosses grow.
Now!
Hey, get out! Get out of the way!
Stop there!
Advance with me.
Get up.
Stransky, God damn it! Get off your ass!
I have to reload.
How do I reload, Sergeant Steiner?

A FlLM BY RAlNER WERNER FASSBlNDER
In front of the Briests'
manor in Hohen-Cremmen...
the famiIy seat since the time
of EIector Georg WiIheIm...
the viIIage street Iay stiII,
bathed in the midday sun.
On the park side,
a wing buiIt on at right angIes...
cast a broad shadow
on a white-and-green chequered path...
and on a Iarge, round fIower bed
with a sundiaI in the middIe...
and Canna indica and rhubarb
around its edge.
Effi, you should have become an equestrian artiste.
Always on the trapeze, an aerial spirit! l do believe you would enjoy it.
Perhaps, Mama.
But then who would be to blame?
Whom do l take after if not you?
Or do you think Papa?
You have to laugh yourself.
Why don't you make a lady out of me, then?
Would you like that?
No.
No.
Don't be so boisterous, Effi!
Not so impetuous! lt worries me when l see you like this.
A STORY OF RENUNClATlON lS NEVER AMlSS.
Baron lnnstetten was not even 20... when he was garrisoned over there with the Rathenow regiment... and was on friendly terms with the local landowners.
He especially liked to visit my grandfather's estate in Schwantikow.
Not because of grandfather, of course.
When Mama talks about it... it's obvious for whom he came... and l think the feeling was mutual.
What happened then?
Everything took its natural course... as it always does.
He was still so very young.
Then father came along.
He was already in the council of nobles and owned Hohen-Cremmen... and she accepted him without more ado... and became Frau von Briest.
And what became of lnnstetten?
He didn't kill himself, or he wouldn't be coming today.
He resigned his commission... and began to study law.
But Frau von Briest,
who couId aIso be unconventionaI herseIf...
detained Effi as she was hurrying off.
She Iooked at
the charming young creature...
who was stiII fIushed from pIaying
and in the bIoom of youth.
And she confided to her.:
''I think you had best stay as you are.
''Yes, stay as you are.
You Iook very comeIy...
''so innocent and unprepared,
not at aII primped up.
''And that's the main thing right now.
''I have something to teII you, Effi.''
She took her daughter by both hands.
''I must teII you....''
''What's the matter, Mama?
You frighten me.''
''I have to teII you, Effi...
''that Baron Innstetten
has asked for your hand.''
''Asked to marry me? SeriousIy?''
''It's not a matter to joke about.
''You saw him two days ago,
and I think you Iiked him.
''He is oIder than you,
but that is aII to the good.
''He's a man of good character,
weII-situated and weII-bred...
''and if you don't say no,
which I scarceIy expect you to do...
''by the age of 20, you wiII be...
''where others are at 40.
''You'II rise much higher than your mother.''
Effi, come here!
Effi was not greatIy interested...
in mundane possessions...
but when she went stroIIing
with her mother...
perusing the window dispIays
and went into the Demuth store...
to purchase aII manner of things
for her honeymoon in ItaIy...
her true character reveaIed itseIf.
OnIy the most eIegant things wouId do...
and she wouId renounce
aII idea of the second-best.
Second-best meant nothing to her anymore.
She knew how to do without things...
and in forgoing things Iike that,
she seemed undemanding.
But when she reaIIy
set her heart on something...
it had to be quite exceptionaI...
and in that respect, she was demanding.
What else have you set your heart on?
-Nothing, Mama.
-Nothing at all?
Nothing, quite seriously.
But if there were something....
Well? lt would be a black Japanese screen... with golden birds on it... with long bills like cranes.
And a lamp for our bedroom that would radiate a red light.
Now you're silent and look at me... as if l'd said something improper.
No, Effi, not improper... and certainly not to your mother. l know you too well.
You have a great imagination... and you conjure up pictures of the future.
The more colourful they are... the lovelier and more desirable they seem to you. l became aware of that when we were shopping for your honeymoon.
Now you think it would be wonderful... to have a bedroom screen... with all kinds of fabulous beasts on it... and all lit by a dim red lamp. lt seems like a fairy tale to you... and you would like to be the princess.
Yes, Mama, that's how l am.
Yes, that's how you are. l'm aware of that.
But, my dear Effi, we have to tread warily in life... especially we women.
Don't you love Geert?
Why shouldn't l love him? l love Bertha, l love Hulda, l love old Niemeyer... and needless to say, l love you and Papa. l love everyone who's nice to me and spoils me.
Geert will spoil me, too.
He wants to buy me jewellery in Venice.
He doesn't know l don't care for jewellery. l prefer to clamber around and play on the swing... fearing that something will break and l'll fall... but knowing it won't cost me my neck.
Do you love your cousin Briest?
Very much. He's always so amusing.
Would you have liked to marry him?
Good heavens, no!
He's hardly more than a boy.
Whereas Geert's a man... a handsome man... with whom l can cut a dash... who will make a mark on the world.
-What entered your mind?
-You're right, Effi. l'm glad to hear it.
-But you have something else on your mind.
-Perhaps.
Tell me, then!
Well, you see, Mama... the fact that he's older than l am... doesn't matter. Perhaps it's a good thing.
He's not really old.
He's fit and well... and soldierly and dashing. l could almost say l'm all for him... if only... well...
-if only he were just a little different.
-Different in what way?
Yes, in what way?
You mustn't laugh at me, Mama. lt's something l heard only recently at the pastor's house.
We were talking about lnnstetten... when suddenly old Niemeyer frowned... in an admiring sort of way and said:
''The baron is a man of principles.''
-So he is, Effi.
-Of course. l think Niemeyer even said... lnnstetten was a person... of great probity... and that seems to me to be even higher.
But l am not at all.
You see, Mama... that's something that pains and frightens me.
He's so kind and good to me... so considerate.
But l'm afraid of him.
A MAN lN HlS POSlTlON
HAS TO BE COLD, OF COURSE.
ON WHAT DO PEOPLE FOUNDER lN LlFE lF NOT WARM HUMAN EMOTlONS?
There's nothing like a wedding!
Except one's own, of course. l don't know how you can say such a thing, Briest. lt's news to me that you have suffered from marriage. l can't imagine why.
Let's not talk about us.
We didn't even have a honeymoon!
Your father was against it.
But Effi is going on honeymoon.
How l envy her!
On the ten o'clock train, off they went!
They must be... somewhere near Regensburg by now. l imagine he'll describe... the treasures of the Valhalla, without alighting, of course. lnnstetten is... an excellent person... but a bit of an art fiend.
Whereas Effi... our poor Effi is a child of nature. l'm afraid he'll torment her... with his enthusiasm for art.
All men torment their wives.
There are worse things than a passion for art.
You're right.
We don't want to quarrel over that. lt's much too vast a subject.
And every person's different.
You would have been in your element.
You'd have suited lnnstetten far better than Effi.
A pity! Now it's too late.
The other things will be sent on.
Thank you.
Off we go, Kruse!
They are dependent on the regions they trade with... and since they have connections throughout the world... you'll find people among them from all over the world... even in our good old Kessin, although it's out in the sticks.
But it's delightful, Geert.
You always speak of ''the sticks''... but l find a whole new world to discover.
All sorts of exotic things.
That's what you really meant?
A whole new world... with a black man or a Turk perhaps... or even a Chinese.
Even a Chinese.
How well you guess!
Possibly we do still have one.
We certainly used to have one.
He's dead now and buried in a little fenced-off plot of earth... right next to the churchyard. lf you're not afraid, l'll show you... his grave sometime. lt lies among the dunes... surrounded by marram grass and a few immortelles.
And always the sound of the sea. lt's very beautiful... but also rather eerie.
Yes, eerie... and l'd like to know more about it.
Then again, maybe not. lf l hope to sleep well tonight, l won't want to see a Chinese by my bed.
How you spoil your poor little Effi!
A grand piano, and this rug... l do believe it's Turkish.
And the bowl with fish, and the jardiniére! l'm being spoiled on all sides!
The master was quite right.
''Up with the lark'' was my parents' motto, too. lf you sleep away the morning... the whole day is in disarray.
But the master won't be too strict with me. l lay awake a long time last night. l was even somewhat afraid.
What do l hear, ma'am? What happened? l heard a strange sound above me... not loud, but insistent... like dresses with long trains brushing over the floorboards. ln my agitation, l thought l saw small, white satin shoes... as if someone were dancing up there, very quietly.
That's in the hall upstairs.
We used to hear it in the kitchen, too.
But not anymore.
We've grown accustomed to it.
Effi... you're a delightful creature.
You have no idea how much l think so... and how l wish to show you every moment... that l think so.
There's plenty of time for that. l'm only 17... and don't intend to die yet.
Not before me, at least.
Admittedly... if l were to die, l would like to take you with me.
No one else should have you.
What do you say to that? l'll have to think it over.
But let's forget it. l don't like talking about death. l'm in favour of living.
What sort of life shall we lead here? ln ''good old Kessin,'' as you call it... there must be some society we can keep.
Are there good families in the town?
No, Effi... in that respect you'll be greatly disappointed.
You'll meet a few members... of the local aristocracy.
But here in the town there's nobody.
Nobody at all?
That's hard to believe.
Nearly 3,000 people live in the town.
And among a population of 3,000, apart from people like Beza, the barber... there must be some kind of elite or so....
AS WELL AS THE COMMON PEOPLE
THERE MUST BE AN ELlTE.
...and the room upstairs, where the curtains brush the floor....
But... what do you know about that room?
Only what l just said.
For a good hour... when l woke up last night... it was as if l heard shoes shuffling over the ground... as if someone were dancing... and something like music, but very faint.
When l told Johanna about it this morning... in excuse for having slept so long afterwards... she said it was the long curtains in the room upstairs.
To put an end to the matter... l think we should simply cut them shorter... or close the windows.
The stormy season will soon be here anyway... by the middle of November.
Show him in!
My husband already told me.
He's in his office... but he should be back any minute. l'd like to tell you how much pleasure... your beautiful flowers and card gave me yesterday. l ceased to feel like a stranger here.
And when l told lnnstetten, he said we would become firm friends.
The district councillor said that?
The councillor and your dear self... are, if l may say so, ma'am... the perfect match of two kind persons.
For l know what your husband is like... and l can see how you are, ma'am. l hope your eyes don't deceive you. l'm so very young...
-and youth--
-Ah, my dear lady... don't say anything against youth.
Youth... with all its faults... is something beautiful and engaging.
Whereas age... for all its virtues... is not worth much.
Personally, l can't say much on the matter.
About age, l can, but not about youth... because l was never really young.
People like me... are never young.
That is the saddest thing of all.
One has no pluck.
One lacks self-confidence.
The years go by... one grows old... and life was meagre... and empty.
Oh, you shouldn't say such things!
We women are not that bad.
No, of course not.
GieshuebIer wouId have Iiked
to decIare his Iove...
and, Iike EI Cid or some other hero...
sought her permission
to fight and die for her.
Since this was not possibIe
and his heart couId bear no more...
he stood up, Iooked for his hat,
which he found at once...
and, after repeatedIy kissing Effi's hand,
quickIy withdrew...
without a further word.
Everywhere Effi went...
she had the same impression.
Mediocre peopIe,
usuaIIy of dubious charm...
who, whiIe taIking about Bismarck
and the Crown Princess...
were reaIIy eyeing Effi's attire.
Some thought it too pretentious
for such a young Iady.
Others found it unseemIy
for a Iady of her sociaI standing.
They recognized the infIuence of BerIin.
A regard for appearances,
a strange awkwardness...
and uncertainty
in her approach to major issues.
For the Borckes in Rothenmoor...
and the famiIies in Morgnitz
and Dabergotz...
she was ''affIicted with rationaIism''...
whiIe the Grasenabbs in Kroschentin
decIared her to be an ''atheist.''
AdmittedIy, oId Frau von Grasenabb...
née StiefeI von StiefeIstein
from south Germany...
had made a vague attempt
to cIaim Effi for the ideas of deism.
But Sidonie von Grasenabb,
a 43-year-oId spinster...
wouId have none of it.
''She's an atheist, Mother...
''and that's the truth of the matter!''
Whereupon, the oId Iady,
who feared her own daughter...
wretchedIy heId her tongue.
Yes... we should celebrate this day... but l'm not sure how.
Shall l play you... a victory march?
Or should l... bear you in triumph across the hall?
We ought to do something... for you should know... today's courtesy visit was the last.
Thank goodness!
But the mere feeling that we can relax now is celebration enough.
You might give me a kiss, though.
But you don't even think of that.
Not a token of affection the whole journey.
You're as icy as a snowman.
Don't go on! l shall mend my ways.
THEN CAME THElR FlRST SEPARATlON,
WHlCH LASTED ALMOST 12 HOURS.
DEAR MAMA!
Can l....
You called, ma'am?
Johanna, l'm going to bed. lt's still early, l know.
But l feel so alone.
Please post the letter first.
When you return, it will be time for bed.
And even if it isn't....
What's she like?
She's very young.
But that's no bad thing, quite the opposite.
The young ones just stand in front of the mirror... titivating themselves all the time, so they don't see or hear too much.
They don't count candle stumps... or begrudge a person a kiss... just because they don't get any themselves anymore.
My previous mistress was like that... but the present one's not. ls he very affectionate?
Oh, yes.
You can imagine.
But he leaves her alone...
Yes, but don't forget there's the prince, Frau Paaschen!
And he is district councillor, after all.
He may want to rise even higher.
Of course he does. And he will. lt lies in his nature.
My husband says so, too.
He's a good judge of people. l'm so afraid.
That'll pass, ma'am. We've all been afraid.
You've all been afraid?
What do you mean? lf you're really afraid, ma'am, l can make up a bed here... and sleep here till tomorrow... or until the master comes back.
The master shouldn't find out l'm afraid.
He doesn't like that.
He wants me to be brave.
But l can't be. l know l have to overcome my fears... and do as he wishes.
What's the matter with your mistress?
Kruse said you'd slept over there.
Yes, sir.
Madam rang three times quickly.
Not without reason, l thought.
And l was right.
Probably a dream, or the other thing.
What other thing?
-Oh, you know, sir--
-l know nothing.
Anyway, it must stop.
HaIf an hour Iater, Effi appeared.
She Iooked IoveIy, quite paIe,
and Ieaning on Johanna's arm.
But when she saw Innstetten...
she ran to him and hugged and kissed him...
and the tears ran down her cheeks.
You see, Effi... l can't just go away from here... even if one could sell the house or exchange it for another... it would be like a rebuff to the prince. l can't have the people here saying:
''lnnstetten is selling his house...
''because his wife thought the picture of a Chinaman near her bed was a ghost.''
That would be the end of me.
One would never live down... the ridicule.
You have no idea how ambitious l am. l married you out of ambition.
Don't pull such a serious face! l love you.
What does one say when one plucks a flower and pulls out the petals?
''l love you...
''with all my heart...
''with every part.''
-ls someone buried there?
-Yes, the Chinese.
-Ours?
-Yes, ours.
Then there is something to it? Some story?
You'd better tell me all about it.
The truth can't torment me more than my imagination.
Where does one begin?
Even with stories it's difficult.
Oh, Geert, how delightful it all is... and what a dull existence l led in Hohen-Cremmen!
Never anything out of the ordinary!
You shouldn't talk like that.
Whatever you think about ghosts... beware of things that are unusual... or what people call ''unusual''!
What you find so enticing, including the sort of life...
Miss Trippelli leads... is usually gained at the cost of happiness. lt arrives in Berlin at 6:50... and an hour later... if the wind's right, they'll hear it in Hohen-Cremmen... rattling past in the distance.
Would you like to be on it, Effi?
GieshuebIer was very fond
of his artist friend...
and esteemed her taIents highIy.
But his enthusiasm did not
bIind him to the fact...
that she possessed...
onIy modest sociaI accompIishments.
And these were what he cuItivated
assiduousIy himseIf.
Marietta, l have ordered a modest supper for 8 o'clock.
We still have 45 minutes... unless you'd prefer to sing a cheerful song at table. l wonder what he'll bring.
Something by Gluck, l imagine... something highly dramatic. lf l may say so, Miss Trippelli... l'm surprised to hear you're only a concert singer. l think you'd be ideally suited... to the stage more than most.
LuIIaby by Louis Spohr.
AII is sIumbering, sweet and deep
Come, my chiId, now you must sIeep
Outside it's the wind that sighs
Whispering ''sususu, '' its IuIIabies
SIeep, my chiId, sIeep
That's enough! l wish l could tell you... how grateful l am to you! lt was all so... lovely, so assured... so fluent.
But most of all, l admire... the calmness with which you perform. l'm so impressionable.
The least mention of ghosts... makes me tremble... and l am unable to regain my composure.
You sing these things so powerfully, so movingly... yet you remain so serene yourself. l come from an enlightened family.
When the phonograph appeared... my father said,
''There's something to it, Marie.''
And he was right. There is something to it.
We are beset on all sides.
You will come to realize that.
Shall we go in to supper?
BARONESS lNNSTETTEN, NÉE BRlEST.
ARRlVED SAFEL Y. PRlNCE K. AT STATlON.
MORE ENAMOURED OF ME THAN EVER.
MANY THANKS FOR YOUR HOSPlTALlTY.
REGARDS TO THE BARON,
MARlETTA TRlPPELLl
''Three wise kings came to Christ's door.
''One among them was a blackamoor.
''Today, a Moorish purveyor brings all kinds of spiced and dainty things.
''lnstead of myrrh and incense, though...
''he brings morsels of almond and pistachio.''
To receive the respects of a good person... is something special, agreeable.
Don't you think so, Geert? l do indeed. lt is perhaps the only true source of joy.
Or it should be at least.
But everyone is so wrapped up in mundane things. lncluding me. ln the end, though... we are what we are.
ALL WAS STlLL lN THE HOUSE.
''What I hinted at recentIy
has now been confirmed.
''Every day anew,
Innstetten expresses his joy at the news.
''I need not teII you how happy I am myseIf...
''since I shaII have new Iife
and distraction about me...
''or, as Geert puts it, 'a precious toy.'
''Those are probabIy the right words,
but he shouIdn't use them.
''They're Iike a stab in the heart...
''and remind me how young I am...
''and that I'm scarceIy out of the nursery.''
-Who was she?
-Registrar Rode's widow.
Strange... l always imagined registrars' widows to be poor.
So they are as a rule.
She was an exception.
She was altogether a very peculiar woman... sickly and weak on her legs.
That's why she had a woman servant strong enough... to protect and carry her if anything happened. l've seen her.
Kind brown eyes with a frank and honest look.
-But a bit simple.
-That's right.
To shake off her sense
of coIdness and duIIness...
she feIt the desire to go for a Ionger waIk.
And her doctor had toId her
that exercise in the fresh air...
was the best thing for her condition.
What is your name?
Roswitha.
That's an uncommon name. lt must be....
You're right, ma'am. lt's a Catholic name.
And l am a Catholic. l'm from Eichsfeld.
Being Catholic makes things even harder.
A lot of people won't take Catholics... because they always run to church to confess... but don't confess the main thing.
The times l've heard that! l'm a bad Catholic. l've completely lapsed.
Perhaps that's why things have turned out badly for me.
You have to stick to your faith... and take part in everything. l'd like to ask you something.
Are you fond of children?
Certainly. lt's terrible, the things you have to do for old women like that.
But a dear little thing... like a doll... that stares at you with its little eyes... that's something... to put joy in your heart.
You are a good, true soul. l can see that.
Somewhat plainspoken, but they're often the best people... l felt at once l could trust you.
Would you like to work for me?
The baby will have to be nursed... and cared for... perhaps even specially fed. l sure l'm not mistaken in you.
You did quite right, Effi. lf there's nothing bad in her serving record... we'll take her on the strength of her kind face.
One rarely goes wrong with that, thank God!
All will be well now. l'm no longer afraid.
ON THE MORNlNG OF JUL Y 3,
A CRADLE STOOD NEXT TO EFFl'S BED.
DR. HANNEMANN PATTED
THE YOUNG WOMAN'S HAND AND SAlD:
''TODAY'S THE ANNlVERSARY
''OF KOENlGGRAETZ,
''PlTY lT'S A GlRL!
''BUT NEXT TlME MAY BE DlFFERENT
''AND THE PRUSSlANS HAVE MANY
''VlCTORlES TO CELEBRATE.''
She compIeteIy forgot that she was married.
Those were happy hours.
But best of aII...
she Iiked to stand on the swing
and fIy through the air...
with the feeIing, ''I'm going to faII!''
A strange, tingIing sensation...
a sweet thriII of danger. lnnstetten is a man of honour.
He is indeed.
And he loves me.
Of course he does.
And where there's love, it will be returned.
That's how things are. l'm just surprised he hasn't taken time off for a quick visit.
-When one has such a young wife--
-lnnstetten is so conscientious... and wants to stand high in favour.
Kessin is just a stepping stone.
And anyway... l won't run away from him. l belong to him. lf one is too affectionate with such an age difference... people just laugh.
Yes, they do, Effi.
But one has to live with that.
By the way, don't mention it to anyone... not even to your mother. lt's hard to know what to do.
And it's much too vast a subject. lsn't that Crampas coming?
And from the beach?
Surely he hasn't been bathing on September 27th!
He often does things like that.
Just showing off!
Good morning.
Come in!
Please forgive me... for not receiving you with all due ceremony... but 10:00 a.m. is an ungodly hour.
One is informal, not to say familiar.
Take a seat... and tell us what you have been up to.
Judging by your hair... which l wish for your sake you had more of, you've been bathing. lt's going to be a wonderful winter... if we can count on your support.
Miss Trippelli is coming.
Trippelli?
-Then my presence is superfluous.
-By no means.
Trippelli can't sing the whole week. lt would be too much for her and for us.
Variety is the spice of life... a truth... that every happy marriage would seem to refute. lf there is such a thing as a happy marriage, mine excepted.
How about hunting seals next time?
That's not possible. The harbour police.
When l hear things like that!
Does everything have to be so legal?
Legality is boring.
Crampas, that's typical of you... and Effi applauds you.
Women, of course... are the first to cry for a policeman... but the law doesn't interest them.
That has always been their privilege, and we... can't change it, lnnstetten.
No.
And l don't want to. l don't want to exculpate anyone.
But you, Crampas... you have learned discipline... and know very well that law and order are vital.
A man like you really shouldn't talk like that... not even in jest.
You have a sublime disregard for these things.
''lt won't be the end of the world,'' you think.
Not yet, perhaps... but one day it will be.
The eIection campaign,
which began in October...
prevented Innstetten taking part
in further excursions.
Crampas and Effi wouId have stopped, too...
in deference to the peopIe of Kessin...
if Kruse had not been present
as a kind of chaperone.
As it was, they continued
their rides into November.
A good conversationaIist...
Crampas wouId teII stories
about war and his regiment...
and anecdotes about Innstetten...
who, with his earnestness and reserve...
had never fitted into
the spirited circIe of his comrades...
so that he had been respected
rather than heId in affection. lt's just as well, respect is the main thing.
He loved to tell us ghost stories.
And when he had got us all excited, and had scared some people perhaps... suddenly, it would seem as if he were just making fun of our credulity.
Once l told him to his face...
''lnnstetten, that's a load of poppycock!
''You don't believe it any more than we do...
''but you want to make yourself interesting.
''You think that being unusual will help your career...
''that ordinary people are not wanted at the top.
''And since that's your ambition...
''you've hit on something out of the ordinary, namely ghosts.''
You say nothing? ln all seriousness, Crampas, and l should like a serious reply... how do you explain all this?
My dear lady... as well as furthering his career, regardless of cost... and with the aid of a ghost if necessary... lnnstetten has another passion.
He has an urge to be didactic.
He's a born schoolmaster.
And he wants to educate me?
Education by means of ghosts?
''Educate'' is perhaps the wrong word.
But education in a roundabout way. l don't understand you.
A young wife... is a young wife... and a district councillor... has to travel around a lot... which means leaving his house alone... and unguarded.
A ghost is like an angel with a sword.
The fact that Innstetten kept a ghost...
so as not to Iive in a commonpIace house,
might be accepted.
It met his need to distinguish
himseIf from the crowd.
But to use the ghost
as a means of education...
was mean, aImost insuIting.
And she reaIized
that this ''means of education''...
was not even haIf the story.
What Crampas had impIied
went much further.
AN ARTlFlCE CALCULATED
TO lNSPlRE FEAR.
Heine's writing pulses with life.
Above all, he understands love... and that is the main thing.
But he's not one-sided in this.
What do you mean?
He's not just on the side of love.
Well, even if he were... there are worse things.
What else is he in favour of?
He's a strong adherent of romance... which comes close behind love.
Some people regard them as identical.
Major, please excuse my thumbs when l give you the sandwiches.
As long as you don't give me the thumbs down!
At Don Pedro's court, was a dark, handsome Spanish knight... who wore the Cross of Calatrava on his breast.
This knight, whom the queen secretly loved, of course--
-Why, ''of course''?
-Because we're in Spain.
Oh, l see.
This knight had a magnificent hound.
This had all been going on for some time... and the secret love affair was no longer really a secret.
Unable to bear it anymore... and because he didn't like the Knight of Calatrava anyway... the king was not only cruel... but consumed by envy.
He decided to have the knight secretly murdered... for his secret love. l can't say l blame him.
Well, just listen to what follows! ln some ways, the king was right... but he went much too far.
Allegedly in honour of the knight's heroic exploits... he held a banquet.
And there was... a long table... at which all the grandees of the empire sat... with the king in the middle...
Opposite him was the place for the guest of honour... the Knight of Calatrava.
But he didn't appear, and finally the feast had to begin without him.
There was an empty seat... an empty seat exactly opposite the king.
And then?
Just imagine, as Don Pedro, the king... was about to rise to express his hypocritical regrets... that his ''dear guest'' had not appeared... cries of horror were heard from the servants outside... and before one knew what had happened... something raced along the table, sprang onto the chair... and set a cut-off head at the unoccupied place.
And over the head of the knight, his hound stared... at the person opposite... the king.
The dog had accompanied his master on his final journey... and at the moment... the axe descended... the trusty animal had seized the falling head.
There he was, our friend... sitting at the banqueting table... accusing the royal murderer.
Effi was content...
and gIad they had agreed...
to discontinue their excursions together
for the rest of the winter.
When she considered what had
been discussed and intimated...
during aII those days and weeks...
she couId find nothing that wouId
directIy occasion seIf-reproach.
Was it the major's plan?
Yes. As you know, he was elected unanimously... to the entertainments committee.
We can look forward to a pleasant winter at the club.
He's ideal for the position.
And... will he be acting as well?
No.
He declined to do that... unfortunately.
He could play Arthur von Schmettwitz quite excellently.
He's just directing.
All the worse.
All the worse?
Oh, don't take me too seriously. lt's just a way of saying the opposite, really.
On the other hand... there's something forceful about the major.
He likes doing things over one's head.
One has to do things the way he wants.
What pleased me most... was my charming little wife, who turned all heads.
Don't talk like that! l'm vain enough.
Vain enough perhaps... but not nearly as vain as the others.
-And your 7 beautiful attributes!
-Everyone has 7 beautiful attributes.
A slip of the tongue.
Multiply that number by itself!
How gallant you are. lf l didn't know you, l might be afraid of you.
Or is there something else behind it?
Do you have a guilty conscience?
Have you been eavesdropping?
No.
Sometimes one suddenly realizes... what a treasure one has.
After all, you might be someone like poor Frau Crampas.
A dreadful woman, unfriendly to everyone.
She's a bit like our Frau Kruse. l don't know whom l'd choose between the two of them. l know very well.
There is a difference between them.
The major's wife is unhappy.
Kruse's is uncanny.
And you're more in favour of the unhappy?
Quite definitely.
He's half-Polish.
The name alone...
Crampas!
No reliability... not in anything... least of all with women.
A gambler... not at the gaming table... but constantly taking risks in life.
One has to keep an eye on him. l'm glad you told me that. l shall watch my step with him.
Yes, do that.
But not too much. That's no use either.
Just behave naturally. That's always best.
Best of all, of course... is to be of steadfast character... and to have, if l may use such a high-flown expression... a pure soul.
No doubt, but say no more... especially things that don't make me happy. l thought l heard footsteps upstairs again.
Strange, they keep coming back.
And l thought you were joking. l wouldn't say that, Effi.
But it makes no difference.
As long as one is upright... one has nothing to fear.
AN ARTlFlCE CALCULATED
TO lNSPlRE FEAR.
If it goes on Iike this, we'II have...
a coId winter and be snowed in.
There are worse things than that.
Being snowed in evokes...
pIeasant sensations,
such as protection and support.
That's new to me.
Associations are strange things.
They're based not onIy
on personaI experience...
but on things one has heard
or just happens to know.
You're a weII-read man, Major...
but there's one poem
I suspect you don't know.
It's caIIed God's Wall.
God's Wall?
A nice titIe.
What is it about?
It's a modest story and quite short.
In some war, there was a winter campaign...
and a terrified oId widow prayed to God...
to buiId a waII round her to protect
her from her country's enemies.
God Iet the house be buried in snow,
so that the enemy simpIy marched past.
Yes....
Effi....
She feIt as if she were about to faint.
Did you sleep well?
Yes.
You're fortunate. l can't say the same for myself. l dreamt your carriage fell into the river... and Crampas was trying to save you. l have to put it that way.
And he went down with you.
{2261}{2355}When the time came for|my poor mama to be born...
{2357}{2442}my grandmother Anna Bronski...
{2444}{2505}who was still young|and unsuspecting...
{2505}{2618}was sitting in her four skirts|at the edge of a potato field.
{2620}{2705}That was in 1899...
{2707}{2777}in the heart of Kashubia.
{3438}{3467}Please!
{4433}{4464}He's gone.
{4466}{4508}Anybody come this way?
{4514}{4555}Name of Koljaiczek?
{4557}{4648}- A firebug.|- Short with broad shoulders.
{4649}{4737}I seen him! Running like|a bat out of hell!
{4741}{4772}Which way?
{4952}{4999}I don't believe it.
{5248}{5332}- Doesn't matter. He's gone.|- Must be in Bissau.
{5334}{5389}If he's not here,|it has to be one or the other.
{5389}{5456}There's no place else.
{5496}{5540}And besides, it's raining.
{6785}{6835}All right, Koljaiczek.
{6842}{6887}My name is Joseph.
{7721}{7835}Joseph and Anna hid|with the raftsmen...
{7835}{7898}for almost a year.
{7901}{8038}That's how long|it took the police to catch up...
{8039}{8082}with my grandfather.
{8370}{8413}Don't shoot!
{8512}{8588}- Don't shoot him!|- Fire at will!
{8831}{8890}After that dive...
{8894}{8977}Koljaiczek was never seen again.
{8995}{9074}Some say he was drowned...
{9092}{9119}some that he...
{9120}{9172}escaped to America...
{9174}{9278}and in Chicago,|under the name of Joe Colchic...
{9279}{9337}became a millionaire.
{9356}{9442}They say he made his pile in lumber...
{9449}{9528}in matches...
{9540}{9645}and in fire insurance.
{9937}{9993}As for my grandmother...
{10003}{10104}she sat year after year|in her four skirts...
{10106}{10177}hawking her wares in the market.
{10226}{10275}Geese!
{10276}{10340}Not too fat and not too lean!
{10341}{10398}And she grew older.
{10428}{10477}The First World War came...
{10478}{10573}and instead of geese...
{10609}{10649}she had only|turnips to sell.
{10892}{10962}Turnips!
{10997}{11064}My poor mother grew older too.
{11075}{11164}She was worried|about her cousin Jan.
{11190}{11246}Jan had been called up for duty.
{11316}{11375}- Name!|- Bronski, Jan.
{11376}{11439}- Year?.|- 1898.
{11454}{11479}Cough.
{11616}{11656}Rejected!
{11746}{11823}They've turned me down|for another year!
{11877}{11930}For the first time, my mother...
{11932}{12010}held her cousin Jan in her arms...
{12035}{12050}and I doubt...
{12051}{12161}if they ever embranced|more happily.
{12331}{12424}Sister Agnes, is there too much paprika?|Or does it need more clove?
{12640}{12674}What did she say?
{12692}{12786}She says you're a born cook,|Mr. Matzerath.
{12787}{12854}You know how to turn|feelings into soup.
{13277}{13373}The war had spent itself.
{13375}{13449}Danzig was declared a Free State.
{13453}{13488}The poles were given...
{13490}{13531}their own post office...
{13531}{13611}where Jan Bronski went to work.
{13616}{13690}Alfred Matzerath also|stayed in Danzig.
{13768}{13852}We Kashubians|have always been here.
{13866}{13910}Long before the Poles...
{13918}{13977}and naturally|long before the Germans.
{13978}{14042}Old stuff, Jan.|Now we've got peace!
{14045}{14094}Germans, Poles, Kashubians--
{14095}{14138}we'll all live together in peace.
{14233}{14269}I don't know.
{14305}{14346}Well, you'll see.
{14555}{14645}The two men, so different despite|their similar feelings for Mama...
{14648}{14731}liked each other...
{14732}{14839}and in that triunity,|they brought me, Oskar...
{14839}{14886}into the world.
{14937}{15015}The sun was in the sign of Virgo.
{15017}{15116}Neptune moved|into the house of middle life...
{15118}{15212}establishing Oskar|between faith and disillusion.
{15949}{16013}Push, push!
{16102}{16184}Push, Agnes, push!|Push hard!
{16329}{16391}It's coming! It's coming!
{16423}{16482}I first saw the light of this world...
{16483}{16547}in the form of a 60-watt bulb.
{16548}{16636}Alfred, it's a boy!
{16841}{16899}I knew it would be a boy...
{16922}{16996}even if I sometimes said|it would be a girl.
{17204}{17258}Let's see how much he weighs.
{17361}{17429}When he's big,|he'll take over the shop.
{17446}{17519}Now we know what|we're slaving for.
{17526}{17597}When little Oskar is|three years old...
{17599}{17660}he shall have a tin drum.
{17699}{17815}Only the prospect|of the tin drum prevented me...
{17816}{17900}from expressing more|forcefully my desire...
{17901}{17957}to return to the womb.
{17959}{18007}Besides, my umbilical cord|had been cut.
{18008}{18090}There was nothing|more to be done.
{18374}{18483}As it was, I could hardly wait|'til my third birthday.
{19274}{19301}What is it?
{19350}{19406}Oh, it's little Oskar!
{19412}{19462}Do you want some more cake?
{19475}{19550}Your mouth's filthy.
{20092}{20149}Respect the human body. That's--
{20151}{20203}And with rolls at 3 pfennings--
{20237}{20320}The main thing is a stable currency.
{20334}{20394}And plenty to drink!
{20398}{20504}Here's to the stable mark|and the 3-pfenning roll!
{20586}{20636}To youth!
{20637}{20680}And to beauty!
{20855}{20957}We won't be so young|when we meet again!
{21190}{21301}Love, oh love
{21303}{21402}is a power divine!
{22815}{22864}September 12...
{22962}{23006}Next year, you'll be this big!
{23007}{23074}And then, this big! And this.
{23075}{23115}And then as big as me!
{23116}{23140}Gangway!
{23174}{23216}Fresh from the celler!
{23453}{23546}- Playing, Mr. Scheffler?.|- Heavens, no!
{23549}{23612}Go ahead. I'll just watch.
{23616}{23660}Besides, it's my bedtime.
{23661}{23757}- He's always tired.|- You shouldn't have married a baker.
{24084}{24156}It's been a long time since Grandma|took anyone under her skirts.
{24157}{24212}Let's have a little game!
{24788}{24856}Hey, cousin, you're out of diamonds!
{24872}{24943}Don't argue! Play!
{25128}{25165}I have two diamonds myself.
{25168}{25214}How would I now?
{25293}{25335}That day...
{25340}{25407}thinking about the|grown-up world...
{25408}{25503}and my own future...
{25503}{25569}I decided to call a halt...
{25570}{25668}to stop growing then and there...
{25669}{25727}and remain a three-year-old...
{25728}{25785}a gnome, once and for all.
{26693}{26755}One, two, three.
{28131}{28179}God! There he is!
{28186}{28205}What happened?
{28205}{28304}He's fallen down the stairs!
{28310}{28346}Do something!
{28435}{28477}Why was the trap open?
{28477}{28507}He's bleeding!
{28513}{28600}Alfred, it's your fault.|You left the door open!
{28602}{28668}I was only getting beer|for everybody.
{28805}{28858}Run and get the doctor!
{28886}{28985}- It looks bad.|- You! You! It's your fault.
{28986}{29040}You left the trap open!
{29108}{29167}Stop! Stop!
{29333}{29403}Calm down!|What's done is done!
{29811}{29924}Two weeks in bed|and Oskar will be as good as new.
{29994}{30062}Just a slight concussion.
{30071}{30113}Plenty of cold compresses.
{30114}{30201}My fall was a complete success.
{30203}{30292}The family story was:|On his third birthday...
{30294}{30375}our little Oskar|fell down the cellar stairs.
{30377}{30469}No bones were broken,|but after that, he didn't grow--
{30472}{30516}not a single centimeter.
{30578}{30671}That drum again!|So loud!
{30798}{30889}So there's my little Oskar,|all well again.
{31172}{31209}Not in the house, I said!
{31209}{31265}Besides, it's broken.|You'll hurt yourself.
{31267}{31333}- Staying? There are mushrooms.|- Sorry. Post office time.
{31335}{31375}Leave the drum here.
{31377}{31440}If you hurt yourself,|it will be my fault again.
{31471}{31527}See? I told you so.
{31609}{31686}Give me that drum|and I'll give you a candy.
{31702}{31777}Let them have it.|I'll get you a new one.
{31780}{31824}No! Oskar don't want!
{31825}{31866}We'll see about that.
{31872}{31890}Alfred, why must you...
{31891}{31925}always use force?
{31943}{31989}My drum!
{32377}{32556}And so I discovered that my voice|was capable of a scream...
{32558}{32601}so highly pitched...
{32602}{32728}that no one dared|take my drum away...
{32743}{32781}Shards bring luck!
{32793}{32912}because when my drum was|taken away, I screamed...
{32913}{33029}and when I screamed,|valuable articles burst into bits.
{33066}{33142}Where's the witch, black as pitch?
{33410}{33482}Here's the black, wicked witch!
{33647}{33716}There are going to be changes!
{33718}{33788}Scum! Beat it!|I'm coming down!
{34507}{34626}O glorious call of the sun!
{35129}{35181}I'll take this one.
{35254}{35358}if you please,|at this extraordinary potato:
{35370}{35482}this swelling, luxuriant flesh,|forever...
{35483}{35544}conceiving new shapes...
{35550}{35620}and yet so chaste.
{35638}{35684}I love a potato...
{35687}{35732}because it speaks to me.
{35733}{35849}The spuds are|bigger this year than last.
{35862}{35895}What are you doing?
{35930}{35984}Oskar learn to write.
{35989}{36076}Stop that.|You'll never learn to write...
{36078}{36209}and read the great classics,|the eternal truths:
{36210}{36252}''Die unto life!''
{36691}{36760}Hold it.|Now I've got all of you.
{36790}{36823}A bit more to the right, Alex.
{36824}{36886}For you on your first day of school.
{36889}{36930}Eyes this way, please.
{37170}{37249}My name is Spollenhauer,|and I am your teacher.
{37251}{37279}Be seated.
{37312}{37390}And now, dear children,|do any of you know a song?
{37483}{37537}You must be little Oskar.
{37539}{37586}We've heard so much about you!
{37590}{37630}How well you play!
{37631}{37711}Isn't our Oskar a fine drummer?.
{37755}{37822}But now we'll put the drum away.
{37832}{37899}It must be sleepy.
{37927}{38027}After school,|you can have it back again.
{38117}{38169}You're a naughty Oskar.
{38243}{38309}I will now read you the program.
{38316}{38422}Monday: Writing,|Arithmetic, Reading...
{38423}{38458}Religion.
{38460}{38545}All together: Writing!
{38562}{38613}Arith-me-tic!
{38624}{38671}Oskar, stop that!
{38686}{38719}Religion.
{39184}{39217}Get out!
{39322}{39407}Strange!|Very strange!
{39408}{39470}How old is he, did you say?
{39471}{39506}Six, Doctor.
{39507}{39568}Inge, kindly undress Oskar.
{39580}{39668}How long is it since|he fell down the stairs?
{39670}{39732}Three years on September 12.
{39733}{39795}We'd better examine|the spine again.
{39796}{39887}Be a good boy.|I'll give it right back.
{39909}{39971}Oskar, give me your|drum. I'll hold it.
{39973}{40051}See, you can't get|out of your shirt.
{40058}{40161}Oskar, if you're not good,|the doctor won't make you well.
{40162}{40263}Come, child.|Give me your drum!
{40946}{41042}Amazing! Amazing!
{41154}{41206}I shall write a paper...
{41207}{41296}about it for one|of our medical journals...
{41298}{41363}if you have no objection.
{41689}{41781}The destructive force|of this local phenomenon...
{41794}{41875}...is such as to suggest...
{41876}{41993}an anomalous formation|of the lower larynx...
{41995}{42101}in little Oskar Matzerath.
{42103}{42224}Not can we exclude|the hypothesis...
{42226}{42323}of a concomitant development|of the vocal cords.
{42325}{42404}Did you hear that?|In a medical journal!
{42406}{42474}Does the doctor say|why he won't grow?
{42490}{42541}You'll have to ask him that.
{42571}{42614}Why he won't grow.
{42615}{42646}Cut it out!
{42671}{42720}He's yours as much as mine.
{42726}{42755}If not more.
{42757}{42816}Who left the trap open,|you or me?
{43229}{43318}Uncle Hailandt,|come spit in the soup.
{43319}{43416}Look what I found in the pond!|Two frogs!
{43703}{43761}What are you doing,|Tom Thumb?
{44077}{44133}Make Oskar taste the soup!
{44783}{44820}Now it's your turn.
{44822}{44874}You'll love it.
{44891}{44921}A treat!
{44923}{44959}Open your mouth!
{45087}{45131}Good, huh?
{45135}{45202}Just a little more!
{45980}{46071}Labesweg and its backyards|hemmed me in.
{46076}{46199}I longed for space and|took every opportunity...
{46200}{46284}to escape the persecutions|of the soup cooks...
{46285}{46350}by going into town...
{46351}{46432}alone or with Mama.
{47834}{47871}Drum's busted.
{47897}{47961}Want me to mend it?
{48003}{48039}He's getting a new one.
{48302}{48337}Hello, Uncle Jan.
{48804}{48839}Coming?
{48964}{49002}I must leave you now.
{49029}{49084}A few little errands.
{49090}{49126}Good-bye, Agnes.
{49163}{49232}This is for your drum, Oskar.
{49707}{49763}Who do I see?|Oh, Mrs. Matzerath...
{49765}{49823}and little Oskar, for a new drum?
{49835}{49892}Yes, Mr. Markus. Again.
{49893}{49934}He's always at it.
{49935}{50017}I never know what year it|is or what day...
{50018}{50080}except when you come in.
{50082}{50169}Something tells me|it must be Thursday again.
{50194}{50256}You have such beautiful hands.
{50316}{50415}Oskar, see that box?|Hand it to me.
{50441}{50480}That's it.
{50481}{50582}See, Mrs. Matzerath.|Beautiful stockings. Silk!
{50583}{50656}Pure silk. Fine quality!
{50673}{50751}One, two, three pairs.|Take them.
{50752}{50811}They'll suit you fine.|A bargain!
{50812}{50853}Much too dear for me!
{50854}{50927}- They're worth it.|- Maybe later.
{50928}{51007}I'll let them go|for half a gulden.
{51022}{51055}So cheap?
{51085}{51139}No, Markus, that's|driving them away.
{51140}{51207}Take them!|Don't ask questions!
{51213}{51258}And now, Oskar...
{51266}{51328}what would you like?
{51353}{51411}Oh! A new drum we need?
{51415}{51523}Just choose one.|You know where they are!
{51524}{51605}See, Oskar?.|He's so happy!
{51663}{51740}Mr. Markus, could|little Oskar stay...
{51741}{51796}with you for half an hour?.
{51827}{51881}I have some|important business.
{51882}{51956}Yes, yes, I'll watch him|like the apple of my eye.
{51957}{52036}Do your important business|and don't worry.
{52037}{52097}The little prince|will stay with me...
{52115}{52179}while you do your|important business...
{52195}{52245}like every Thursday.
{59683}{59728}We're blocking the street!
{60332}{60438}Danzig has always|been German!
{60485}{60553}If not for the German people...
{60566}{60630}these eastern regions|would have succumbed...
{60659}{60695}to total barbarism...
{61265}{61312}Have a nice walk?
{61519}{61605}The Fuhrer's speaking all over!|Except here!
{62742}{62851}And now, ladies and gentlemen,|the smallest of the small:
{62851}{62925}Bebra and his midgets!
{65992}{66028}My word!
{66068}{66154}Now it's three-year-olds|who choose to stop growing.
{66201}{66251}My name is Bebra.
{66306}{66408}Directly descended|from Prince Eugene...
{66438}{66549}Whose father was Louis XIV...
{66550}{66629}and not some Savoyard,|as has been claimed.
{66649}{66777}I stopped my growth|on my tenth birthday.
{66800}{66887}Better late than never.
{66971}{67017}Tell me, my dear Oskar.
{67019}{67077}How old are you?|Fourteen? Fifteen?
{67078}{67120}Twelve and a half.
{67121}{67206}No! And how old|do you think I am?
{67251}{67298}Thirty-five.
{67327}{67389}Flatterer!
{67455}{67559}I shall be 53 in August.
{67561}{67614}I could be your grandfather.
{67630}{67699}- Are you, too, an artist?|- Not really.
{67700}{67736}Although...
{67996}{68084}as you see, I can lay|claim to a certain artistry.
{68214}{68292}You must join us. You must!
{68306}{68356}Do you know, Mr. Bebra...
{68474}{68516}to tell the truth...
{68524}{68603}I prefer to be a|member of the audience...
{68604}{68703}and let my little art|flower in secret.
{68708}{68752}My dear Oskar!
{68772}{68851}Trust an experienced colleague.
{68853}{68933}Our kind must never|sit in the audience.
{68934}{69015}Our kind must perform|and run the show...
{69017}{69067}or the others will run us.
{69117}{69174}The others are coming.
{69175}{69228}They will occupy the fairgrounds.
{69231}{69321}They will stage torchlight parades,|build rostrums...
{69322}{69361}fill the rostrums...
{69362}{69461}and from those rostrums,|preach our destruction.
{69594}{69690}They're looking for you, dear friend.|We'll meet again.
{69694}{69767}We're too little to|lose each other.
{70485}{70532}They are coming!
{72072}{72132}These damn puttees always slip!
{72192}{72236}I need boots.
{72238}{72279}You know they cost way too much.
{72280}{72332}Or leather gaiters at least.
{72350}{72393}How do I look?
{72435}{72529}- Going to the demonstration?|- Yes, at the fairground.
{72542}{72579}Big show!
{72695}{72755}Gauleiter Lobsack is speaking.
{72783}{72850}And what a speaker!
{72852}{72972}I'm telling you,|these are historic days.
{72979}{73060}A man can't stand aside.|Gotta join in.
{73123}{73197}You should read|the Danzig Sentinel.
{73213}{73264}Crazy your opting for Poland.
{73266}{73338}I've told you 20 times.
{73358}{73394}I'm a Pole.
{73406}{73450}Think it over.
{73468}{73516}Take your umbrella.|It looks like rain.
{73517}{73590}An umbrella with my uniform?
{73633}{73749}The stew is on, Stir it now and then.|Be done in 20 minutes.
{73750}{73786}Bite to eat before you go?
{73787}{73898}No time. Duty is duty|and schnaps is schnaps.
{74289}{74353}National comrades...
{74356}{74439}of Danzig and Langfuhr...
{74446}{74555}of Ohra, Schidlitz|and Praust...
{74567}{74686}from the hills|and from the lowlands...
{74687}{74766}I know you all...
{74767}{74864}cherish but one wish.
{74875}{74943}It has been our heartfelt wish...
{74958}{75055}ever since a shameful diktat...
{75056}{75087}separated us...
{75088}{75173}from our beloved|German fatherland.
{75184}{75294}That wish is: Home to the Reich!
{75532}{75623}What is the meaning|of this Free State...
{75646}{75721}that was so generously|foisted on us?
{75754}{75867}It means that our waterfront...
{75868}{75916}is crawling with Polacks.
{75927}{76001}And in the middle of|our beloved Old City...
{76001}{76094}they've stuck a|Polish post office--
{76095}{76158}something we can do without.
{76282}{76322}We Germans had...
{76329}{76376}post offices...
{76387}{76461}before the Poles...
{76476}{76529}even thought of|writing letters.
{76539}{76605}We taught them the alphabet.
{76649}{76731}And now, dear|national comrades...
{76733}{76805}let us welcome our guest|from the Reich.
{76896}{76970}Party comrade Albert Forster...
{76970}{77081}has just arrived on the field.
{79634}{79753}What's going on?|I want to know what's going on!
{79754}{79799}Block all the exits!
{84317}{84366}Can you catch them|with a clothesline?
{84441}{84504}Real fish or just old shoes?
{84512}{84605}Suppose we take a look?
{84606}{84650}Maybe something's there!
{85116}{85155}The sack!
{85932}{85970}Call that fat?
{86076}{86114}You should have seen them...
{86121}{86180}after the battle of Jutland...
{86184}{86243}when we and the English--
{86408}{86445}See what I mean?
{86451}{86496}After the battle...
{86576}{86675}they were this thick!
{86968}{87025}He wanted one-fifty...
{87031}{87078}but I gave him a gulden.
{87980}{88057}Don't expect me|to touch your eels!
{88058}{88116}Don't put on airs.
{88117}{88186}I'll never eat fist again.|Certainly not eels.
{88187}{88297}You've always eaten them,|and you knew where they came from.
{88319}{88342}Quiet!
{88363}{88423}Stop that drumming!
{88424}{88486}- Leave the child alone!|- And sit down!
{88487}{88547}Who was to blame?|Who left the trap open?
{88563}{88635}Old stuff. Sit down.
{88641}{88717}See if they're not delicious.
{88718}{88778}Come on. Dig in.
{88785}{88870}Fresh eels with dill sauce...
{88879}{88964}a bay leaf and|a twist of lemon peel.
{88965}{89036}Don't make her eat|if she doesn't want to.
{89038}{89095}- keep out of this.|- Leave her alone.
{89095}{89144}She'll only vomit.
{89145}{89242}I paid good money for these|eels. Just try them.
{89258}{89374}They've been well|cleaned and washed.
{89428}{89513}No gall. Light, healthy liver.
{89514}{89557}And so fresh!
{89676}{89725}Oskar! Sit down!
{89780}{89828}For hours I stand at the stove.
{89830}{89904}Some people would be very|happy to eat my eels.
{90607}{90644}I don't know what to do.
{90646}{90685}Alfred, calm down!
{90691}{90773}I can't talk to her.|And the fish is getting cold.
{90774}{90821}Women are more sensitive.
{90837}{90941}You talk to her. if|only she'd calm down.
{93812}{93875}Shouldn't I warm|them up at least?
{94722}{94784}Don't do it with Bronski...
{94805}{94887}who picked the Polish post office.
{94888}{94935}Don't bet on the Poles.
{94940}{95009}If you must bet,|bet on the Germans.
{95018}{95087}Sooner or later,|they'll take over.
{95096}{95181}And then you'll be stuck|with Bronski...
{95182}{95219}that crazy Pole.
{95220}{95300}You'll be in trouble.
{95309}{95389}Why not bet on Matzerath?
{95512}{95618}Or if you'd do me great honor...
{95618}{95654}bet on me...
{95669}{95714}on Sigismund Markus...
{95728}{95769}that was just baptized.
{95770}{95819}No, Markus. Please!
{95820}{95861}We could go to London...
{95863}{95956}like everybody else.
{96058}{96104}Look. There he is!
{96119}{96177}We'll take him with us to London.
{96180}{96256}He'll live like a prince.
{96279}{96353}Thank you, Markus,|but it's impossible.
{96354}{96407}And not because of Bronski.
{96408}{96490}I'm glad to hear that.
{96490}{96529}Steer clear of Bronski...
{96530}{96590}and stick to Matzerath!
{98412}{98513}Come on! Play!
{98535}{98577}One-two, one-two!
{98663}{98703}Can't you...
{98706}{98794}or don't you feel like it, brat?
{98800}{98852}Cause you can do|everything else.
{98855}{98953}I have sinned in thought,|in word and in deed.
{98955}{99008}Alone or with others?
{99009}{99038}With someone else.
{99047}{99088}When and where?
{99100}{99163}Always on Thursday,|in Tischlergasse.
{99164}{99253}But, child!|Why that low neighborhood?
{99255}{99355}I can't help it, Father.|I try, but I can't.
{99356}{99460}But my dear Mrs. Matzerath,|the consequences!
{99479}{99531}I've got them already, Father.
He's the kind of boy who should be studying.
Yes, but six kilometers to get to school and six kilometers back seems like a lot to me.
He's young, he has good strong legs!
Just when we're about to have another baby...
He could have started helping me around the house.
He'll help you when he's older.
Let Providence provide now.
I grew up without ever seeing the inside of a school.
That's not a good reason and you know it.
If God has given intelligence to your son, it's a sign He wants more from your son than He does of others.
You're his father and it's your duty to do God's bidding.
Just what we needed was this worry too.
THE TREE OF WOODEN CLOGS lnterpreted by the people of the Bergamo countryside
A peasant's son going to school. What will people say?
A farmstead in Lombardy at the end of the 19th century.
Four or five peasant families lived here...
...The house, land, and livestock belonged to the landowner
A part of the harvest was given to him.
Let him see too. Don't make noise, the foal is frightened.
Be careful not get any husks into the maize.
Cross yourself nicely!
Make the Sign of the Cross now.
Under the covers and ask your guardian angel to stay close.
So, are you happy you'll be going to school?
Hold the sack tight.
No, hold it at the top and open it wide.
The bailiff is here!
The maize should be weighed today.
Take care of it.
You can bring the figures to me later.
Rosa, please tell my wife to come up here.
Come on, hurry up with those rocks.
Move up, let's go now, get a move on.
Can't you move over here and unload?
Be careful you don't make holes in those sacks.
Giopa is here!
May the Lord always give us work and good health and never let us want for anything.
Here, take this.
For our dear departed ones and the souls in Purgatory, may they ascend to Heaven.
No children, don't laugh.
Poor souls like that who have nothing are closer to God.
Here girls, take this.
Tell your mother I need it before Saturday.
Get inside, girls!
Blessed Mother! Teresina, wait, let me get on.
Alright, but we'll take turns. You first, then me.
Alright, start counting.
...fifty!
Now it's your turn.
You're a lot heavier than me,
I'm only going to count to forty.
Alright, be careful, go slowly!
The wash is all on the ground, what did you do?
I couldn't keep going.
The lady at the hotel said to bring them before Saturday.
How? Can't you see
I have two full baskets?
Teresina, look at the pretty stones I found.
Girls, pick up the baby and go see if Grandpa
Anselmo needs anything.
Tell Pierino to help Grandpa wash the milk pails.
I wanted to know if I could say hello to you.
I'd like to be able to wish you a good evening.
If that's all you want, then there's no harm in it.
Won't you say anything back to me?
I'll wish you a good evening too.
I want to take a bath in the basin too.
Is that water warm enough?
It's fine, it's good and warm
Here you go, sit down in there.
First, we wash your shoulders, then your neck and ears.
Now close your eyes... we'll soap you up good
Minek, sleep now.
Say the Our Father and
Hail Mary tomorrow morning, so God will light your mind.
Why do you need the chicken droppings?
For the springtime, when
I plant the tomatoes.
Mama, they're fighting!
What is it? They fight like cats and dogs everyday.
Aren't you Andrea
Runk's son?
The man who died recently?
I knew your father well, he was a good man.
He left a widow with six children.
The poor woman has to take in wash to feed them.
The machine is out of grain.
- How old are you now?
- I'm fifteen.
I need a strong boy, you can work here if you like.
I'd like to work here very much.
Let's see what your mother says.
For me, you can start tomorrow.
Here's the stable.
- What should we do?
- Let's go in.
The suitors are here!
Be quiet for a moment.
Children, come outside.
Listen, the pipers are playing.
Mama, the pipers!
They must be at the landlord's house.
It's freezing tonight.
Listen Tonino, listen to how nicely they play.
It's already Christmas time.
Grandpa, the moon!
''Haze around the moon, snow is coming soon''.
Not if the cold doesn't let up.
- What does that mean?
- The earth needs the snow.
Who's there?
It's snowing.
Papa, where are you going at this hour?
It's snowing, I have to put the chicken manure in the garden.
It's for this spring when
I plant the tomatoes.
Chicken manure is stronger than cow manure, if I put down just a little, the ground won't freeze.
Do you have do this at night?
I don't want anyone to see me.
If this works, I'll bring ripe tomotoes to the market two or three weeks before anyone else.
You and your thoughts had better be careful, you'll catch your death!
Be quiet, Garibaldi.
It's snowing.
''Bones to the dogs, meat to the butcher''
''The blackbird pecks at the soil''
''Women are silent while the men toil''
''When snails are on the rose, a lad to his lady does propose''
''There's blood to make a pudding too''
''And a kick in the pants for all of you!''
Listen to you, Batisti!
How does he invent all these stories?
He has a new one every night.
Let's say the rosary before the children all fall asleep.
It's still early.
You'll be tired later.
Batisti, tell us the one about the ditch!
He can tell that story another night.
He'll need heavier clothes, it's starting to get cold.
He'll have to make do with what he has for now.
We'll have to think about paying the midwife soon.
We can make do with the women here, after all, it's not the first time.
Don't talk that way, it can be dangerous.
The tub needs washing.
Where should I put these?
The butcher is coming to slaughter the pig.
It's going to be wet today.
''A pig in the snow is like wine down below''.
Only if the grapes were good.
Is that water hot enough yet?
The hotter the better, keep the fire good and hot.
The bailiff is here.
Hasn't the landlord come yet?
No, he'll be arriving later.
- How can we weigh it then?
- I'm here to weigh it!
How did you raise this animal?
Come in the house
- and have a glass of wine.
- Perhaps later.
Are you trying to kill this animal before its time?
Everyone pull this way.
Push it with the stick now!
There, in the middle. Get your fingers out of the way.
What do you think?
It's a good animal.
Good day, Father Carlo.
I saw your son going to school. How is that going?
It's fine for now,
I can't complain.
You'll see, you'll be pleased with that boy someday.
If God blesses me that way...
Where is Widow Runk?
She's at the stream washing, should I go and get her?
No, it's not important,
I'll go find her.
- That's a fine big animal!
- I can't complain.
- There will be plenty of meat
- I know how it was raised!
I cared for it better than any Christian.
Then take care to love God, or you'll reach the same end!
What have I done wrong?
I've never killed anyone!
That's not enough.
How should we do the weighing?
Take care of it yourselves.
Don't you want some to eat?
We'll see...
Go home with the others,
I'll hold the umbrella.
I'm sorry I look this way,
Father, what can I do for you?
Don't worry and keep working. I've come here because I have something important to tell you.
As I didn't see you in church last Sunday...
You're right. Sometimes
I don't know where to turn... or how to keep going with six children to raise.
I'm not here to scold you, in fact I'll tell you now that you're right to stay home and care for your children.
This is a duty that comes even before Mass
Even the Lord understands certain things.
It's about your children that I want to speak with you.
I spoke to the Mother Superior at the orphanage yesterday.
There's no room right now, but I told her about you and they'll take the little ones to help you breathe a bit.
The others are growing up...
What do you think about it?
When my eldest son comes home from work tonight.
I'll speak to him about it
I don't know what to tell you
It's the only thing we can do for the moment
Children, move back or you'll get burned!
It's cold tonight, there are so many stars out!
Come, I've made some hot water for you
Don't waste the coals, we won't have enough for the bedwarmers
Eat your soup before it gets cold
Bring the soup here, we'll eat by the fire
Grandpa, make the sparks fly!
Sparks are devils who've escped from Hell
Why do the devils escape from Hell?
To go out looking for souls!
Are there souls in the fireplace?
No, there are no souls in the fireplace, they go out the chimney and above the roof to look for souls to harm
But devils are afraid of good people
When the devil finds a good man or a good child, he runs away!
With the sign of the Cross too
Do you say your prayers?
I do!
Then you don't have to be afraid
Move the fire, you'll see them run far away
Go away devils in this house! Go away, there are good children here!
Father Carlo came today, he came here just for us and told me there is a possibility to send
Annetta and Bettina away
I told him we'd talk about it at home tonight
Do we really need to send them away?
If we really don't have enough to live on...
Teresina will be twelve this spring, she can start to work at the spinning mill
Pierino can help in the house and the stables
I'd rather work day and night, but we'll keep my brothers and sisters at home with us
What are you doing, Grandpa?
I'm planting seeds
What kind of seeds?
Tomatoes!
Now what are you doing?
Hiding them where it's warm under the straw. Even if it'scold, they'll sprout
Come here by the grain sacks
Antonio, you go there, you go over there and I'll go here
Look in the hayloft
I'll look in the hayloft!
Hide, don't let them see you.
Come under
Go look under the straw in the stable
Mama, Grandpa said to come to the stable
He said to hurry
What's wrong with her?
She's been like this all day
She isn't eating and she can't get up
God, not foot and mouth...
The only thing to do is call the veterinarian
Pierino, Mama said to go get the veterinarian!
They're playing hide and seek
Pierino...
They're playing hide and seek
Annetta, go tell Mama the veterinarian is here
Anselmo, what's happened to this poor beast?
It looks bad this time
Was it nice to ride?
Get some fresh water and bring it to the stable
You go into the house!
Is this your animal or is it the landlord's?
It's ours by the grace of God
You're not in His grace this time
Blessed Mother, what happened to her?
Listen to me, the truth is that I wouldn't let her live until noon
Butcher her while you're in time and can make a few coins
Go back to the house!
Not this too... you can see what condition we're in. We don't have enough to live
Listen to me and do as I say while you're still in time
Don't say anything to the children!
How much for your trouble, Doctor?
You have enough troubles, some other time
You start cooking the polenta,
I'll be back shortly
Let's put on the water for the polenta
God, don't abandon me now that I'm all alone
I do what I can,
You can see that, but without Your grace,
I'll never be able to go on
Oh Lord, who died on the cross for our sins, don't look at our merits, but at Your goodness and make this water pass beneath the cross of Calvary wash away all the ills of body and soul
Jesus, forgive all our sins, even those we commit without knowing we commit them and for the love of Your five wounds, for the pain of the Virgin Mary and all the saints and souls, give me this blessing, Lord
You can't refuse me!
Here, sit and eat some polenta while it's still hot
Hello, you're home?
Come here, come and get yourself warm
His feet are wet
Let's take off your clogs and socks and get you warm
Be careful, or you'll get chilblains
Here, eat
What did your teacher say?
He talked about water!
He said there's lots of little animals in water
Fish!
No, not fish
Other tiny little animals and in a drop of water there are lots, even drinking water
Yes, tiny little animals that you can't see
If you can't see them, how do you know they're in there?
With a machine that has a thing that looks in the water
Doctor's instruments!
There are still things to learn!
Holy Mary, you scared me!
Why?
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you
We see each other every night at the farmhouse
It's one thing to see you at the farmhouse with everyone else and another to see you here alone
It's still very cold at night
No, even the water in the ditches isn't freezing now
Fifteen days from now we'll be in Our Lady's month... and I wanted to ask you for a kiss
Those are things that happen when the time comes
Good evening
Good evening!
Lift those sacks over there, your feet are on them you lazy good for nothing!
The pail of milk spilt all over, you idiot!
Then you do this work if others aren't able to! lngrate! Don't come near me or I'll beat you!
Blessed Mother, they're fighting!
Get them apart!
Finard, aren't you ashamed?
You'd hit your own father!
I curse you!
No Finard, God hears and never forgives a father's curse
Mama, the cow is standing!
Go tell Grandpa to come right away!
Thank you, Lord
Friki is here, ladies!
Beautiful first quality cloth!
Good prices, come and see the best cloth on the market!
Wil you swindle us like last time, Friki?
Friki has never swindled anyone!
I respect women as much as I respect monkeys!
Come ladies, I'll make your husbands proud of you
I've got the finest, first quality cloth, all colors of ribbons, buttons and threads
Come and look and this will make you happy...
This is just right for you!
The color is too light
Then take the darker one, look at that pretty skirt!
Did you hear that?
It said hello!
First quality cloth to make a blouse or skirt for the Feast of Our Lady
All bargains, you couldn't steal them for less!
This is the best from Paris, first quality from abroad!
Listen to Friki, I've been to Africa and I know about monkeys
They reason better than men do
He'll get us confused with the monkey stuff and cheat us...
How much for this one?
Clever lady, that's the best!
Give us a bargain, she's getting married
Ask any bride around here if I haven't made them happy!
Quiet now,
Friki is a rascal!
One day a group of foolish boys had the idea to throw stones at French soldiers passing by
Their commander,
General Lutrec, decided to burn the village to punish them
In desperation, the people ran to the church to pray just as children do when in danger, they call their mother
So the Madonna, our heavenly Mother,
Mother of us all, performed a miracle
The Madonna and Child painted on this wall began to cry
A messenger was sent to tell General Lutrec
He didn't believe the man and thought it was trick, so he came here
When he saw the
Madonna crying, he fell to his knees and put his helmet and sword at her feet in devotion
350 years have passed since, but that sword and that helmet are still there to remind us of all the dangers waiting in the world
We gather here each year to remember that great miracle, and to remember all the other miracles that happen everyday in every corner on earth in the lives of men and of all creation
Dear people, we wouldn't be here without miracles
Miracles are the strength that man doesn't have, they are the strength of God's love
This love is as necessary to us as the air we breathe, as the land which feeds us, and the water and light which give us life
The only way we can deserve
God's love is by loving our neighbor
May Christ be praised
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like a volunteer
I want to demonstrate to you what this animal can really do!
Not your hat, take off your jacket
I want to show the people the miracle this fat performs, this fat that truly heals all ills
Give me your hand. Do you feel pain here, here and here?
Like this, it has to be spread like this... from the bottom to the top
Do you see the water coming out?
You have arthritis, yes you do, sir, tell them!
Mama, Papa is...
He's going straight upstairs
My God, you can't even climb the stairs, what have you done?
Nothing... they got me drunk
It was my friends!
What can I do?
Look at the condition you came home in!
What condition... so I'm drunk, stop it now
Ah, so that's how you go to Vespers, you liar!
You said you'd go to church and you're here dancing!
You laugh, you're on the verge of Hell!
You won't laugh anymore when you're burning in the flames
Liars, you have no fear of God!
Social order is always behind the new needs of life
Only with common possession of knowledge and progress can we finally speak of the conquest of civility
When justice and respect for every citizen's rights becomes an everyday institution a law of life practiced by all, when there are no longer the privileged few, while others lack, can we say we've built a democratic society
Unfortunately, social progress moves slowly, blocked by those who fear it, but mostly, it's not helped with enough courage or sacrifice by those who call for it as a human right
So most people stay passively in the background and wait for things to ripen in their favor, while a small band of innovators...
All great progress has come from an illuminated minority...
Have you had breakfast?
Goodbye
I have to have a son who pees the bed every morning!
A boy of fifteen!
Pisspants!
It's not my fault, it's an illness
They'll teach you when you're a soldier
When you marry, you'll still be wearing a diaper!
Run quickly
Batisti, come home, the baby's being born!
It's another boy
You'll be happy about that!
Let's go now and leave them alone for awhile
While she's lying in, she should eat white bread
That would be best
I'll take care of it
Ladies, I don't know how to thank you
For what? If we don't help each other...
You took too big a risk by not calling the midwife
Babies come into the world alone, they don't need anyone
Do you feel well at least?
Thank God, yes
Well... another mouth to feed
No, you shouldn't be afraid
Do you remember what your poor mother used to say?
''When an angel comes to earth,
God gives him his own bundle''
He's not home yet, did something happen to our Minek?
Down boy, leave me alone, go on Dido
What happened to you?
Minek, are you home?
Yes, he's home
Why are you so late?
He must have gotten lost
Children don't think that when they come in late...
Let's put you by the fire, the ashes are still good and hot
Here, warm those feet, they're frozen
Come on, let me see
How did you break your clog?
Minek, come and see, your new brother is here
He came home with his feet wet
Don't tell her your clog is broken, be quiet
Come close
Can you see him?
Are you happy you have a little brother?
Here, have some white bread, you should have a treat too
Batisti's wife had a boy
They named him Giuseppe
Behave, be good children,
I have to go out for a moment.
Behave yourselves
Grandpa, tell us a nursery rhyme
''Here's a rhyme from Zambel
With no bones or any shell''
''Up the stairs she will creep
At the children for to peep''
''She sees all those who do not sleep
At the foot of the bed she waits, I'm told''
''Snuggle under before you're cold!''
Quiet now, you'll wake the baby
Let's say the rosary now to thank the Blessed Mother
While you say the rosary,
I'll finish my work
Hurry now and don't let anyone see,
This is something that only your Grandpa does
The ground is stained on top.
It has a skin in winter
Why does it have a skin?
To keep out the cold and not let the warm underneath escape
Is the earth warm underneath?
Of course, so the seeds won't die.
Get the planting peg
Peppino is going to work
When you grow plants with the roots close together, it's better to leave a bit of their own soil
Why are they all by the wall?
The wall keeps the heat from the stable inside, and from the sun outside and tomatoes need heat
If we don't have frost, this year we'll sell our tomatoes at the market two weeks before everyone else
What will the others say?
They'll stand there with their mouths open and their noses in the air
Now let's plant another row here
Go home and close the windows while I gather the wash
Get them into the stable, a storm is coming
At midnight, when there wasn't a living soul around, the man left the house and he went to the tomb of the lady wearing jewels.
He took a pick-axe and slowly moved the marble tombstone
He sat on the edge of the grave and then he jumped down inside
The coffin was shining and polished. He tried to pry open the coffin with his pick, but the wood creaked and didn't seem to want to open.
Then he stood on it with both his feet and gave it one great blow and crack!
He'd split it apart
The corpse was there in her veil with her arms crossed
He first took off the tiara she wore on her head, and then, to take the pearls she wore around her neck, he put his hand beneath her neck and lifted her head
The rings she wore on this hand he got off easily, but on the other hand, wearing the bigger more precious rings, he pulled and tugged and could not get them off
He took out a knife and chopped off the hand wearing all the rings
Nothing more was heard of the man
But one night, he'd gone to a feast in a villa and there near his village as he was returning home his horse reached a crossroads and would go no further
He saw a woman in black nearby the church
''Do you need anything, ma'am?''
And the lady asked him if he could take her home
He helped her to sit on the gig and whipped the horse, but the horse, instead of going to his village, turned down the road leading to the cemetery and stopped there right outside of the gates
He kept whipping the horse, but it wouldn't move
''This is my home'', said the lady,
''help me down, please''
He didn't know how much was in his pocket, what could he do?
He got down and went around to help the lady
''Give me your hand, ma'am''
The lady then stood and said to him, ''My hand?
You have my hand!''
Blessed Mother, you scared me to death!
He fell in the shit!
Cow shit, or did he shit his pants?
And then what do we do?
Later we sing
''Hit it hard, hit it soft and we'll drive the winter off ''
''March is on the way and spring has come to stay!''
You filthy thieving pig!
I'll kill you now!
This time you've gone too far!
The horse has gone mad!
Get out of here, you ugly beast!
You filthy animal, you've done it to me, you lost my gold coin, thief !
What happened for the love of God?
What happened?
Filthy thieving animal
Filthy pig of a thief, she did it to me!
Blessed Mother, he's lost his mind!
The sign woman!
What did you do?
He took a fright
I'm angry, I'm not afraid!
Start with some prayers
Put some water in this glass
You should pray too...
Worms, these are worms.
The fright made them come out and they went all through your belly. We all have worms and while we leave them in peace, they don't move. But if they leave their place, they wander in your belly and then crawl up your throat and strangle you
What can I do?
Take a clove of garlic and thread it through 5 or 7 times
Get some of those big
''furry'' leaves from the field grind them and then get some earthworms
Grind that all together into a paste
This doesn't look like an ''E'' to me
I've been ready for a while.
What are they doing up there?
They're women, let them do what they have to do
Mama, the groom is here
Will you come have a drink?
No, he's taking Communion
Won't you come and have a drink with us?
No thanks, it's too hard to get off the cart!
Teresina, go tell the women we're waiting for them
We're not in a hurry
Brena said to tell you they're waiting
Go down and tell them to go on ahead, the bride arrives last, they have to wait in church
I had to walk to the church on my wedding day, my father needed the cart to bring the grain home
He made the bride, the priest and the witnesses wait!
I should have stayed home and not gone at all!
They said the groom has to leave first
The groom goes first and then the bride comes with her father when everyone is already in church
Then we'd better bring you there
Who should I take?
The bride and her mother
The groom mustn't see the bride until they're at the altar, it's bad luck
That's nonsense
Where's the bride's witness?
He's all dressed up, he looks like the groom
It seems like yesterday that we were married, right wife?
What a braggart, you have three children now
Let's see if he can do as well
She looks so pretty!
Be well, all the best to you
I want to congratulate the happy couple as well and say a few words to them and all of you this morning
There is nothing to wonder or talk about if this couple has married so early in the morning and not as normally done in the light of day
They have nothing to hide.
The reason is another.
They are now leaving on a long and dangerous journey to Milan where they will visit their aunt,
Reverend Mother Sister Maria,
Mother Superior of Saint Catherine's
I want you two to be on your guard and know who you're with.
People today have strange ideas
Pray to God and the Madonna to place a hand on your heads
Most of all, try to always love one another
No money in the world can buy the love between two people
God says not to search for worldly riches, but for the wealth of Heaven and remember that Heaven begins with the love that we are able to show here on earth
Are the ladies comfortable?
Thank you for everything
We'll have a glass to celebrate!
Where are they going?
To Milan
On the boat, they'll be there in an hour and a half
Good luck!
I'll help the ladies
Come with me,
I know where to go
Where do we get the boat, please?
You'll see the steps to the dock down a bit further
It should have already been here now
It's down there. I know,
I've been here once already
Let's hurry then
There's no rush
It's arriving
Let the chain down
It's calm this morning
Let's hope the weather doesn't change
Excuse us ladies, we have to let down the gangway first
Excuse us, the goods get loaded first
It's moving fast
Would you like some, Father?
Thank you very much
Here, and don't get crumbs all over!
Would you like some wine, Father?
We'll feed the crumbs to the fish
Are you a fisherman?
Only they share their food with fish
It's worth the trouble, if you share some bread, you always bring home a bigger catch
I think there are more fish holding fishing poles than there are in the water
Mama, look!
There's smoke over there
It looks like a fire
It must be a bonfire of dried things
With all that smoke, it could be a barn roof burning
Let's hope it's not soldiers fighting demonstrators again
There was a clash between them the other day and they burned down a farmstead
Poor people
There's no more religion or respect for others!
You can't go through, it's blocked!
The soldiers have blocked the way here, use the other street
There was a demonstration
The bells of Saint Carl!
I'm the niece of Sister Maria
Come in, I'll call
Sister Maria
It was a bad day today, times are hard
I'm your aunt,
Sister Maria
Is this your husband?
I'm so pleased. Come, you're surely tired and certainly hungry after your trip
How is my dear sister,
I want so much to see her
It's been years since
I've seen her
When were you married?
Very early this morning
How good of you to come and visit me so soon!
We'll celebrate tonight with the other sisters and with all the children we have in our house
Bless us Lord, and the food you have given us.
Amen.
They're all angels from heaven
The world is beautiful with them here inside
Here, we've done our best
We've never had newlyweds stay before
We're delighted at your blessed union
Marriage is a Holy Sacrament
May you always deserve
God's blessing who united you
All those houses!
His name is Giovanni Battista
He's a year old and in perfect health
Isn't that right,
Giovanni Battista?
He only needs real parents to make him happy
A real mother and father
He can already be a help to his family because he has an inheritance
He has good clothing and a bit of money which is passed to our institution twice a year
For a family of poor people this could sometimes be a true gift of Providence
We must help each other in this world
He can be useful to you and you can be very helpful to him
He's just learning to take his first steps
Try to open your arms and he'll come to you
This is the book that came with the baby.
Listen...
''Of the foundlings vulgarly called 'bread eaters'''
''as well as those still nursing foundlings, ''
''the Pious lnstitution gives to these aforementioned, ''
''and the charitable people who care for abandoned children, ''
''the following allotment''
''Upon consignment of the child''
''they will be given this book and twelve cents''
''as well as undergarments and clothing''
''and a sum of money according to the child's age''
''The lnstitution will continue the prescribed donations''
''up to and including the child reaching the age of fifteen''
''Beyond which time, the child may be kept''
''but no longer at the lnstitution's expense''
He's such a pretty baby!
He may even be a gentleman's son
From now on, he's only a peasant's son
The first thing is to love him and he'll be happy all the same
Come Bettina, let's go see our tomatoes
Look how beautiful they are
There, gather those there
When we go to the market they'll look at our tomatoes
They'll say, ''What beautiful tomatoes they have!''
Look how nice and big that one is, and that one too!
And this one too?
Yes, look how nice it is
What about this one?
That one is ready too
We'll go to the piazza tomorrow morning
Do you remember how tiny they were when we planted them?
And now look at these big tomatoes
What are you doing?
Cutting some grass for the rabbits
And with that grass, did you cut any other plants?
Who cut that tree over there?
I don't know anything
Someone must have cut it
Are they tomatoes?
They're not cherries!
It's not tomato season yet
My garden is ahead of time
Where did you grow tomatoes?
Under my bed!
Do you see how they're looking at our tomatoes?
What tomatoes!
They're already ripe!
I've never seen tomatoes at this time of year
Is is local produce?
- Yes, it's our very own
- He comes every year with his basket and I wait for him. Let's go inside and weigh them.
Old Anselmo is always the first one to bring in tomatoes
What's happened?
Something bad?
The landlord is evicting Batisti
He has to leave his rooms by tomorrow morning
He has to leave with his wife and children
Is that possible?
They said Batisti cut down a tree by the stream to make a pair of clogs for his son Minek
That means taking bread from those people!
It's a harsh punishment
And to think they still have a newborn baby
Tha bailiff is here!
He's here to take the landlords livestock
Those poor people, they have nothing now
Come, let's say a rosary for those poor people
JAKOB THE LIAR
The tale of Jakob the liar is not true.
Honest.
But maybe it is true after all.
- Evening, Heym.
- Evening, Horowitz.
Out so late?
Just walking.
The only pleasure left.
How late is it?
The Germans took away my watch.
Remember the curfew at all costs.
Stop.
Curfew is at 8 o'clock sharp.
- I know.
- What?
Curfew is at 8.
What time is it?
- No idea.
- You should know the time.
What's that building?
The police station.
Enter and report to the officer that you were out after curfew.
Ask for fair punishment.
Anything else?
No.
What do you ask for?
Fair punishment.
OFF LIMITS TO JEWS
During a ferocious battle
our courageous troops
stopped the Bolsheviks
20 km before Bezanika.
My God, he just said Bezanika!
The Bolsheviks suffered losses.
What are you doing here?
The guard stopped me.
He said it was curfew.
He sent me in to report to the officer on duty.
Eavesdropping?
No.
I've never been here.
I'm looking for the door.
I was just going to knock.
The last door on the left.
Strike you dead!
What time is it anyway?
It is just after 7.30.
Why are you here?
Come on, Moses.
Out with it.
What do you have to report?
Don't you talk to Germans?
The guard on Kurländer St. Sent me.
I was out after curfew.
Anything else to report?
I am to ask for fair punishment.
Name?
Heym...
Jakob Heym.
You know paragraph 7 of the ghetto rules?
Of course.
Anybody out after 8...
...will be shot.
Thank you.
- You live far away?
- 10 minutes away.
Go home!
Go on, get out of here and go home.
"Courageous German troops were successful..."
...were successful..."
So you were successful...
Hurry up, Russians!
Hurry up and get here!
Stop staring. We'll stumble and fall.
That car...
Which one?
The open one on the last track.
Yeah, and...
It contains potatoes.
So what's the big deal?
So it is loaded with potatoes.
What's it to you?
Should it have pickled herrings?
Or maybe roasted ducklings?
I'm going to try.
You're crazy.
And when he sees you?
I'll be shot before I starve.
Such a bargain.
- Do you know where Bezanika is?
- Yes.
The Russians are near Bezanika.
You're full of crap.
Listen...
I was arrested and taken to the police station.
I heard it on the radio.
Purely by chance.
A decent guy released me later on.
I know it's hard to believe.
But I'm alive and kicking.
I'll be honest with you.
I'm in possession of a radio.
What?
Get back on your feet.
Don't tell a soul.
Oh, Jakob...
What's new?
Anything new to report?
Why are you asking me?
Jakob... we're old friends, aren't we?
What's that got to do with it?
I'll get straight to the point.
Is it true about the Russians?
What Russians do you mean?
We're old friends, Jakob.
The whole world knows of your radio.
Or did you buy it in the ghetto?
Don't be afraid to tell your best friend.
The whole world knows?
Not the whole world.
Just part of it.
I heard it mentioned.
The rumors are true.
They're 20 km from Bezanika?
Yes, they are.
Not a word.
You know me.
That's what worries me.
The Russians!
This is boring.
You take ages to make a move.
You want to win by rushing me, or by playing better?
You're winning.
By thinking.
Each game lasts at least 2 hours.
Better to win one than lose 5 times.
No, you'll lose your last checker.
Wrong move.
What can I do?
Nothing.
Another game?
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
You played checkers?
- Who won?
- Guess.
She plays faster than she thinks.
Ever noticed?
Heard the latest news?
You know, then?
I heard about it at work today.
You don't look happy.
Why should we be happy?
What is there for us to celebrate, son?
Normally, we would have celebrated.
Toast the newborn with the parents...
Now it's a misfortune.
It'll be hard to raise a newborn child.
A baby?
So you haven't heard?
A girl in district 2 gave birth.
She had twins last night.
But one died a few hours after birth.
When all's over they'll call him Abraham.
When all's over...
...the baby will be dead.
Also the parents.
When we're all over... all's over.
I prefer David.
Little David...
That was Annett's son's name.
Abraham sounds more like an old man.
A child's name is important.
Mr. Frankfurter...
I just wanted to say to you...
I mean... You know...
We're all here...
I wanted to ask you and your wife, of course...
Speak.
As if you ask for my hand?
I'm asking for Rosa's.
Marry Rosa? My God!
Is this the time for plans?
We are in the ghetto!
The boy must be crazy.
Say something!
What prospects do you have?
Rosa is our only daughter, you know.
What dowry can you offer her?
Shall I ask the Rabbi when the wedding suits him?
Think about where to hide when they come for you instead.
Just listen!
His ship's sinking in the ocean, no help in sight.
So he makes plans for the evenings?
The Russians are near Bezanika!
There is no help in sight, you say!
Who told you?
Heym.
- Jakob?
- Yes.
Who told him?
Out with it!
I promised to keep quiet.
He has a radio.
Let's go to your room.
Felix...
Bezanika is not far away.
Imagine it's true.
I can't believe it.
Imagine it!
This will soon be over.
You will act on a stage again.
I will meet you each evening... at the stage door.
Imagine!
Why the cellar keys?
Why are we down here?
- Jakob is a fool.
- Why?
Why?
He heard news. That's his business.
He should be glad and silent.
Isn't it good that we know?
Sure.
Today you know it.
Tomorrow the neighbors...
Soon it will be the talk of the ghetto.
Then the Gestapo will hear about it.
They don't need us to find the Russians.
Of course not.
But the damned Gestapo will know there's a radio here.
They'll turn the area upside down until they find the radio.
They won't rest until they have it.
Where will they find it?
You still have our radio here?
Why didn't you tell me?
I was too scared myself.
Enough now!
Did you hear about the Russians?
I never listened.
I was too scared.
Mischa!
What?
My parents will live with us.
They certainly will not.
What's wrong with them?
You'll wake him up!
- He's deaf as a post!
- Quiet!
Fajngold!
Fajngold!
What's up?
I need to talk to you.
- In the middle of the night?
- Yes.
I met a girl at the pump.
Her name is Rosa.
Why not?
You never saw such a pretty girl.
- Shall I describe her?
- No.
I sure would like to have her here with me.
At least sometimes...
I don't mind.
That's not the point.
It's up to her to decide.
She doesn't know you share my room.
It's my room!
Never mind.
How can we sort things out?
Are you crazy?
I should go out nights?
You forget the laws?
Of course not.
We can divide the room.
Hang up a curtain...
Go hang yourself...
- That's not enough.
- Then build a wall.
I'll say you're deaf.
Say what you want!
You'll go along?
Sure, if you let me sleep.
Thank you.
Why don't you like my parents?
- It's the middle of the night!
- Tell me.
I like them.
But they're not living with us.
Let me sleep.
Mama can look after the kids.
She'll spoil them.
I can't cook.
Buy a book.
We need a house with 5 bedrooms...
For you, for me, and for my parents.
And a nursery...
We've gone without long enough.
We'll sleep in my room and have a room for guests.
I don't want many guests to visit us.
I prefer to be alone with you.
The kitchen is my domain.
I want fancy tiles in the kitchen and a shelf for all my spice jars.
There are lots of spices.
Take saffron...
Know what it's for?
It colors cake and noodles.
Why are you so grumpy since you told me about the radio?
You should be glad like me.
So... should I?
Can't you work with someone else?
What's up with you?
Get off my back, will you?
I hate the sight of you right now.
You keep shooting off your mouth.
Do me a favor.
Work with him today.
Gladly.
- Climb up.
- Go ahead.
I was up there yesterday.
It's your turn.
- What's bugging Jakob?
- No idea.
His guilty conscience?
Steady goes...
Do you know a remedy for hair loss?
Why do you ask?
I'm losing hair.
Is there no cure?
No.
At the barber's shop you used to use a green-colored liquid.
I might just as well have used water from the faucet.
Now tell me the latest!
Nothing to tell.
No news when there's a war going on?
A whole day and night without news?
Leave me alone.
The Russians are near Bezanika.
Are you sure they haven't advanced?
Just a little in the past 24 hours?
I heard 3 kilometers on the news last night.
You don't seem too excited about it.
What are 3 kilometers?
That might not be much to you.
But 3 kilometers are 3 kilometers.
At least they're advancing.
Better forwards than backwards.
They are 5 kilometers nearer.
I feel a lot better today.
Fever?
Not much.
If my thermometer works...
Thank you.
I'll get up tomorrow, though.
That's not up to us to say.
- Seen the Professor?
- No.
Want some?
No thank you.
I'm full.
How are things at work?
Fine. Thank you for asking.
Did you ride the locomotive today?
What locomotive?
Remember?
You went to Rudpol on it.
Of course...
The locomotive has been out of order for several days.
What a pity.
Mischa hasn't been here for ages.
He's busy but sends his love.
Say hi for me.
Good evening.
Good evening, Professor.
- Feeling better, little one?
- Yes, a lot better.
Good.
Remove your gown.
Now I can tell you the whole truth.
This little lady was very ill.
But good little girls can often be helped in such situations.
Much better.
Breathe in.
Hold your breath.
What's that?
I can hear a whistle.
That's Uncle Jakob whistling.
Why is he so happy?
Maybe because I'm better.
I'm turning in.
Go to bed.
It's very late.
What's wrong, brother?
I'm afraid. I am very afraid.
The radio could be bad news for us all.
You know these pigs.
Let's call it a day.
You can be afraid in bed.
Dear God.
Protect us from this great disaster.
Don't let anything happen at this stage.
You have protected us for so long.
Stop the Germans from finding the radio.
Make the spies blind.
Only you know how many spies are here.
Fool them.
Let the Russians get here real soon.
Destroy the radio before it destroys us.
You know how cruel our tormentors can be.
Don't give up.
All radios need power.
Congratulations.
Thank you, dear God.
A wise decision.
You have connections in high places.
What do you think?
How long will this power cut last?
I hope it lasts 20 years.
Why say a terrible thing like that?
You'll never guess.
You can be so cantankerous.
You always were bad tempered.
I used to enter your cafe sometimes and ask you how business was.
You always gave a nasty answer.
See for yourself, you'd say.
The whole place was empty.
Still... that's not the way to speak to an old friend.
Listening.
We have an idea...
The thing is...
If we can't bring the power to the radio we'll bring the radio to the power.
Kowalski has power.
They want to get me killed.
What do you think?
Heard what they want?
From me?
What is it you want from me?
We have no power in our street.
We bring you the radio.
- To me?
- Yes.
The radio?
Great.
What do you think about it?
We'll have to think it over.
What a risk to take!
Bring the radio to my place!
Who will transport the thing anyway?
Shall we do it in daylight perhaps?
At night maybe?
After curfew?
Let's have a procession.
All the guards will be asleep.
They won't mind us moving it.
Damn, he's right.
A crazy idea!
I don't want to bother you.
I've something to show you.
What?
Unlock the door.
Come in.
I have been praying.
I prayed to God that we be kept informed of events.
Not just now.
And what does God do in his wisdom?
Don't let me keep you.
You have things to do.
Will they exchange us for ransom money?
They are negotiating at present.
What are the chances?
It's a question of money.
Never go out alone.
I want to know who lives up there.
In that castle.
It's shorter this way.
Walk on.
A Jewish State is to be founded?
Who says?
We ask the questions here.
It's true.
These things take time.
Now be so kind and let me pass.
Good day to you.
Tell me...
Have you heard anything of Kiepura?
Which Kiepura do you mean?
The singer...
I heard he's in America.
How is he doing over there?
Is he okay?
I heard he's got off to a fine start.
I'm very glad to hear it.
You're welcome, Mr. Horowitz.
How many pages to a newspaper?
It must have at least 4.
He tears them up at least 3 times...
But no more.
That is all he needs.
Now let's see...
That means each page makes
...8 sheets of paper.
That's 32 sheets in all...
A healthy man needs less than that.
What are you mumbling?
Mumbling?
All that mental arithmetic.
What are you up to?
Nothing.
Carry on without me.
Why?
I'm going to use the Germans' john.
Are you out of your mind?
- Go to the fence during the break.
- No.
Oh, no...
Hurry comrade, I've got the runs.
Marotzke's got leave again.
He must know people in high places.
He's always getting leave.
We're stuck here with these garlic mouths.
What the hell are you doing?
You idiots!
Do you think you're on vacation?
Thank you.
He did it on purpose.
Have a good shit?
Just look at my face!
A pretty picture...
All your fault!
I hope you had a good shit anyway.
I swear to you...
That's the last time
I help you out of a spot.
The Germans are suffering heavy casualties.
A fine radio!
Just sport and accidents.
For this trash they slash Kowalski's face.
Who is it?
Lina.
Did you forget about me today?
No...
I was planning to come up later when I finish off some things.
Finished what?
Never you mind.
Have you eaten?
The food you brought me.
I'm tired.
I'll clean up tomorrow.
The Professor said you must rest a lot.
Heard the news?
What news is that?
They say the Russians will come.
Really?
Who says?
Mrs. Sonnenschein, Mrs. London...
Everyone says so...
You didn't know?
No... I heard some talk.
But it was nothing definite.
They are only rumors.
How will it be when they arrive?
How should I know?
Better or worse?
Better, of course.
What things will be better?
You needn't wear the star any more.
You can wear what you like.
No-one asks about your star.
That's all?
You'll have plenty to eat.
All I want?
As much as you want.
The table will be full of food.
You eat what you like.
The rest is cleared away.
It will be for the next meal.
You're fibbing.
It's the truth.
You'll wear nice clothes.
We'll buy them at the store.
What food will we get to eat?
Whatever...
Pies and bread and butter.
Eggs, gefillte fish... whatever you feel like.
Will you make fritters again?
- You bet.
- In the cafe?
That's right.
Remember your promise?
I can help out in the cafe.
I remember.
You make the fritters in the kitchen
and I'll serve the customers.
In summer, ice cream...
That's right.
Will my parents be there too?
I don't know about that.
We must find them.
What about school?
You must attend.
The cafe?
School is more important.
You don't want to go?
School is wonderful.
Dumb kids go into the school and bright ones leave it.
If you think
I prefer you to be dumb...
Stay right here until I say you can come out.
It's just me annoying you again.
Aren't you going to close the door?
I just dropped in.
Nothing special...
I get fed up at home.
I thought of you.
He'll be pleased to see me, I thought.
We always met after work.
It was the normal thing.
We should get used to normality again.
You're so kind.
Besides I wanted more news.
The German losses are good news.
Other things interest me more.
Tell me about them.
Get off my back.
If I know any news I'll inform you.
Can't you leave me in peace in my own room?
Every time I ask for news you get mad at me.
You don't tell me if I don't ask questions.
What's the reason behind it?
I wonder.
Imagine I had a radio and you had to ask me for news.
Are you mad?
In front of the child!
Go upstairs.
I'll be up later on.
You fibbed.
You told everyone.
That's right.
Well done.
Now she knows about it as well as the rest of the ghetto.
I can't see her if she's hidden.
My eye's bad.
Looks real bad.
Are you thinking of Chaim?
Why should I?
What's going on?
What about the Russians?
I wish I had good news.
- They retreated?
- Not that bad.
Go on!
I turned on the radio like I always do.
I twiddled with the knobs as normal.
Not a sound...
Yesterday it worked fine.
Today it is as dead as a doornail.
What are we to do about it?
Who understands a radio?
Now...
Now...
Try harder even if you are a lawyer.
- My hands aren't suited.
- Mine neither.
Did you know his radio broke?
I was the first to know.
Forgive my curiosity in asking.
What does Sir Winston say about it?
Who?
The British Prime Minister Churchill.
My radio conked out.
How on earth did that happen?
It just stopped working.
From one day to the next.
Get away from there!
You've been told before.
Yes sir.
Did you understand?
It's out of bounds.
What's in that car?
How should I know that?
Schramm got off lightly.
They said we were to keep away from that car.
- Did you hear it?
- Yes.
- Why did he go near it?
- No idea.
What's going on?
I heard voices in the freight car.
Voices?
I'm telling you human voices.
Is he telling the truth?
- What?
- About the voices.
Don't ask such things.
Of course it's the truth.
Who's in the car?
It is obvious, isn't it?
Look at that.
Can you hear me?
Who are you?
From the ghetto.
Quiet, you idiot!
They'll notice.
It won't be long.
The Russians are getting quite close.
How do you know?
We have a radio hidden.
Thanks, brother.
You out there...
What's going on?
Brother.
- I'm afraid we must continue.
- Yes you're right.
What's my name?
My name!
What are you doing?
I'm tidying up the place.
You're not finished, I hope.
What are you doing?
Just straightening up.
What are you looking for?
Why is the lamp there?
Which lamp do you mean?
That one.
Is there another one?
What's up?
Nothing.
What's the matter?
Is it the lamp?
Have you ever seen one?
Shall I explain?
This is what we call an oil lamp.
We used them before we had electricity.
You pour the oil in here.
See the small well?
This thing here is called the wick.
It soaks up the oil to the top.
You use this screw here to adjust the length of the wick.
When you light it the room is bright.
Can you light it now?
Unfortunately I have no oil.
Know what I was thinking?
What's that?
Don't laugh.
Of course I won't.
I thought it was your radio.
Will you show it to me?
I said no 100 times and that's that.
He's coming.
- That's him.
- Who?
Meet Josef Najdorf.
- I'm Jakob Heym.
- I know.
Where do you work?
In the factory.
That's the other way.
They start later than we do.
He has time to kill so he will walk part of the way with us.
So tell him why you're here.
I'm a radio technician.
That's a fine profession to have.
He's good at repairing radios.
- He must be. It's his job, isn't it?
- If a valve has blown there's nothing I can do to help.
I have no parts.
Look at it.
Don't bother.
The radio is working again now.
Thanks anyway.
Who repaired it?
It works. Satisfied now?
The radio didn't fix itself.
It was only a faulty wire.
I shortened it.
- Can I go now?
- Yes, you can.
- He's a nice guy.
- When?
Last night.
Did you hear any news?
They're heading for Pry.
- The Russians?
- No, the Turks!
Jakob...
I wanted to talk to you.
We need to plan other things.
What do you mean?
- Business ventures.
- Why?
I'm a business man.
You're a barber.
We should start to make plans about what to do in the future.
We have time.
This is between you and me.
I have some cash hidden.
Not a great fortune.
But I want to invest it well.
They sometimes have money programs.
They give no suggestions at all?
Not even little hints?
Do you really think they advise you on the radio on how to invest hidden money after the war has ended?
I'm asking you as a friend.
What would you invest in?
Maybe luxury goods of some kind.
They were crazy for them after the last war.
David built a house with the profits on the schnapps he sold.
That's right.
Do you think we'll have potatoes to make schnapps?
Probably not.
Everything will be short.
You need good instincts.
Sit right here.
Don't move at all.
Do you hear?
The radio is behind the wall.
I'll turn it on in a minute.
Just the 2 of us will hear it.
If you move I'll turn it right off.
Can I see it?
Certainly not.
Children shouldn't even listen.
It is forbidden.
This is an exception.
It's agreed?
What's on the radio?
Just wait and listen.
I have to turn it on first.
Ready?
Good evening, listeners.
You'll now hear a broadcast with the British Prime Minister,
Sir Winston Churchill.
Good evening, Sir Winston.
Good evening, listeners everywhere.
Please tell us how you assess the present situation.
That is... not difficult to explain.
I am brimming with confidence.
The whole mess will soon be over.
That is wonderful.
How about the Bezanika area?
Bless you, Prime Minister.
Thank you so much.
To answer your question...
Right now it looks very bad for the Germans.
The Russians are winning hands down.
They already took Bezanika.
They are headed for Pry.
Our listeners will be pleased unless they are German.
Thank you for speaking to us tonight.
It was my pleasure.
You heard an interview with the British Prime Minister.
Goodbye.
You liked it?
Yes. It's not over already?
What do you mean by that?
I want to hear some more.
Please.
Please...
Now for all children
Uncle Bob will tell the story of the sick princess.
Do you know it?
No, I don't.
How come he tells a story?
Why shouldn't he?
Wait and see.
You said kids shouldn't hear radios.
Stories are for kids.
It's only forbidden to listen for kids who live in ghettos.
Children outside can listen.
Radios are everywhere.
When will it start?
The tale of the sick princess.
Once upon a time a king had a daughter.
He loved her very much.
He adored his little princess.
One day the princess got ill.
The king asked what she had.
She replied:
I need a cloud to get better.
All of you children out there can imagine how difficult it is to catch a real cloud floating around in the vast sky. Even for a king.
All day long he was too worried to reign.
That evening the king summoned all his wise men... to the palace.
It was quiet.
The king said:
Whoever catches a cloud for my one and only daughter will receive as much gold and silver as he can carry.
When all the wise men heard this they started to think and to ponder and to wonder...
They all wanted to earn all that money.
Not a single one of them was able to catch a cloud.
The princess grew ever so thin.
She stopped eating completely.
Not even buttered bagels.
One day the gardener came to see her.
He hadn't seen her around.
She told him she was seriously ill and needed a cloud to get better.
The young gardener thought a while and happily exclaimed:
Easy!
What do you mean, the princess asked.
How can that be easy?
All the wise men in the land are in despair.
Now you say that is as easy as pie.
It's easy, he said.
Just tell me what clouds are made of.
The princess almost laughed.
But she was too weak to laugh.
Every child in the world knows... that they're made of cotton balls.
Made of cotton balls?
How big is a cloud then?
He doesn't know a thing, she thought.
All you need do is look up at the sky!
A cloud is just as big as my pillow.
The young gardener looked up towards the sky.
They are as big as your pillow.
He ran off as fast as he could and brought the princess a cloud.
It was the same size as her pillow.
You should have seen her face!
Fajngold's been gone for 4 days now.
I thought he was just visiting friends.
He got talking and stayed over after curfew.
It's been 4 days.
How can he talk to friends?
Deaf people communicate as well.
They just use sign language.
You didn't even know him.
- There's no way we can help him.
- That's true...
No...
Do something...
What do you want me to do?
Put the room back just as it was.
Why?
Put the closet back.
But he's gone now.
Do it.
Explain to me why first.
I'd like it so.
Listen to me now.
I'm glad you're sad he went.
You didn't know him.
You just knew his snoring.
People disappear each day in the ghetto.
We can't get worked up about everyone.
You are hard and uncaring.
If it weren't for curfew at 8 you'd get up and leave right now.
Correct.
No tea?
Listen, Jakob.
I have to speak with you.
Go on...
Do you know Avron Minsch?
Should I?
He's the man
I visited your cafe with three years ago.
Remember?
Sure.
You said to me he was just an acquaintance.
That was back then.
He asked me today to become his wife.
What did you reply to him?
It's up to you to make a decision.
Me?
Stop joking.
I'm 36 years old.
He wants to take me to America.
I need time to think.
A rare guest.
Come in.
Sit down.
I expect you can guess why I have come here tonight.
Is Lina feeling worse?
No. That's not it.
I have come to talk about your radio.
Why not?
One more makes no difference.
Pardon?
You want to hear the news.
Not at all!
I am here to protest strongly.
My visit is long overdue.
Why is that?
I cannot imagine whatever in the world got into you when you started spreading news in the ghetto.
I find it hard to imagine you are unaware of the danger you cause us all.
Especially the people who live in this house.
Must I remind you where we are at present?
Hardly...
Maybe I should do so.
Change your ways.
- How?
- Keep your news to yourself.
And then?
Have you seen their eyes?
How desperately they beg for news?
You know how much they need good news?
- Do you?
- I can imagine it. But...
No buts!
I know it won't speed up the Russian advance.
It's no real help.
Another aspect...
Since the news started to get around the ghetto
I have heard of no new suicide here in the ghetto.
Have you?
I know how often you were called.
Mostly too late.
Maybe the whole thing is merely a pure coincidence.
Maybe not.
What's the king's name?
Benjamin.
No name for a king.
Know who Benjamin is?
My uncle in Tarnopol.
Not a king.
Listen...
The princess got ill.
They called a doctor but he couldn't help her.
She said she needed cotton balls to get well.
As big as her pillow.
- What did she have?
- You heard.
There's no such disease.
Maybe...
If it were typhoid or whooping cough...
Know what she really had?
A fart in the head!
Let's go.
She was really sick.
And the gardener helped her.
Then they got married.
- Do you work here?
- Yes.
Is Rosa still there?
- Are you Mischa?
- Yes. Is she there?
She left just now.
They said she can go home.
When did she go?
About 10 minutes ago.
Did they tell you to go?
Don't go home.
- Why?
- The area's being deported.
Fancy meeting you here.
- What are you doing here?
- And you?
I'm going home.
I was only at work for an hour today.
They sent some of us home early.
But not everyone.
- You have the day off too?
- Yes.
Really?
Let's go to my place.
So why are you here?
To pick you up from work.
I thought you might be free.
You'd just left.
A girl told me that.
- She knew me.
- Larissa.
Why are we off work?
That's what I'm wondering.
Maybe because of the Russians...
What do you mean?
Maybe the Germans know it's over.
They want to appear decent.
- For when it's all over.
- Maybe.
Which street?
I don't know.
- Are you hungry?
- Not right now.
Come here.
Mischa!
It's our street.
Let go.
Let me go!
Let go.
Get up.
Your neck's bleeding.
You knew it was going on all along.
I had no time to warn your parents.
Did you see them?
You didn't let me see them.
You'll see them again.
Jakob says...
It's all lies. It's all a load of talk.
You will live here now.
Heard about the deportation?
No, I haven't.
How's things with Rosa?
We're managing to get by.
And food?
We make do, I guess.
She gets no rations.
We noticed that alright.
Can someone help out?
I help Lina.
So does the Professor.
Things are looking bad.
They're emptying the place.
The Germans are panicking.
The deportations show that the Russians are near.
Maybe the deportations are a good sign somehow.
Just try telling Rosa that one.
- You want Uncle Jakob?
- Yes.
He's out.
- Want to wait for him inside?
- Do you live here?
You must be Lina.
- Who told you?
- Mischa.
I know who you are.
Who?
You must be Rosa.
That's right.
- Been here before?
- No.
We get many visitors.
Know why?
No.
They want to hear the news.
Is that why you're here?
No.
But you've heard?
What?
Everything will change.
Look at this.
- Seen one before?
- Yes.
- What is it?
- Just a lamp.
Why are you so sad?
Nothing will change.
- You don't believe Jakob?
- No.
He tells fibs?
But it's all true.
I heard the radio myself.
They're almost here.
Don't bank on it.
The Russians are in Pry.
That's not true.
They're in Mieloworno.
Just 120 kms from here.
The whole factory knows.
I work at the freight yard.
Who hears the news first?
All the news you get at the factory originates from Jakob.
Is there another radio?
No idea.
News gets changed on the way.
It is passed on from person to person.
Everyone adds some detail.
So it gets changed until it is quite different.
They passed Mieloworno.
Do you want me to go home?
No, please stay.
Something happened?
Nothing has happened.
I am just feeling my age.
Can you imagine what these idiots... down at the factory
- no offense to you - are saying?
The Russians are in Mieloworno.
Shall I leave now?
I take it any longer.
Nobody can stand it.
It won't be much longer now.
What's up, Jakob?
I have no radio.
I never had one.
I don't know where the Russians are.
Maybe they come tomorrow.
Maybe never.
They could be in Pry.
Or in Kiev... or even farther.
Maybe they lost the war altogether by now.
All I can tell you for sure is that they were fighting in Bezanika.
You say nothing?
What should I say?
I understand you perfectly.
I really do.
If I had a radio in my possession
I would keep quiet about it.
Or I'd have burnt it.
I am sure about that.
Giving news to an entire ghetto.
Impossible for me.
If I ever understood anyone then I understand you now.
You don't believe me?
What does it matter anyway what I believe?
Don't worry.
I won't ask any more questions.
You knew him?
- What?
- Did you know him?
I'll make you an offer, Jakob.
We'll serve each other for free.
Well?
Good.
Why are you grinning?
A deal's a deal?
What's funny now?
You eat more often than you get a haircut.
True...
But I shave every day.
A deal is a deal.
How could you do this to me?
Aren't there enough murderers in this world?
Why did you have to choose me of all people on the earth?
ALL JEWS MUST ASSEMBLE
TODAY AT 1500 HRS
ONLY 5 KILOS LUGGAGE.
When?
Read for yourself.
Why are you packing?
Why do people pack?
To go away.
Exactly.
Are we going away then?
Yes, we are going away.
Where?
I'm not quite sure.
Is it nearby or far away?
Quite far away, I think.
As far as America?
No.
China?
No.
As far as Africa?
Yes, almost as far as Africa.
Aren't you glad?
I hate traveling.
It will be nice there.
Can we take the lamp?
No.
Please take the lamp.
Maybe there's oil there.
No room.
Get your things together.
We're going away...
We're going away...
- What's up?
- Lift me up to the window.
You weigh a ton.
Give her to me.
Remember the story?
Which one?
The sick princess.
Yes.
Is it a true story?
Of course it is.
The boys said it is silly.
What is silly?
Getting well with cotton balls.
She wanted a cotton ball as big as her pillow.
She wanted a cloud.
She thought clouds are made of cotton balls.
Aren't clouds made of cotton balls?

"A Mosfilm Production"
SERGUEl EISENSTEIN
EDWARD TISSE
GRIGORY ALEXANDROV
QUE VIVA MEXICO!
Mexico, 1931
Sergei Eisenstein, the film director.
His assitants:
Edward Tisse, cameraman... and me, Grigory Alexandrov, director.
How did we land in this amazing country?
Sergei Eisenstein's films of the 20's... especially "The Battleship Potemkin," won him renown.
He, and we along with him... were invited to Hollywood to make a film.
But Eisenstein didn't see eye to eye... with the Hollywood tycoons.
Helped by Upton Sinclair, the American writer... we decided to shoot a film about Mexico.
But first there was much we had to learn... about that country.
The great Mexican painters,
Diego Rivera...
David Siqueiros... and Jose Orozco... were our guides and teachers.
We spent two months filming.
We travelled north to south, east to west... driving thousands of miles along rugged roads.
A feature of this land... struck us as amazing.
A hundred miles meant the difference between epochs... separating the pre-Columbian
Mexico... from that of the time of the Spanish conquest... the Mexico of the feudal rule... from modern Mexico.
Eisenstein felt that this unusual country... deserved an unusual film and that Mexico's tragic story... could be told without actors or sets.
A script was written... and we began making
Que Viva Mexico!
Our filming crew... consisted of only us three.
But we were young.
We were ready to move mountains.
Even so, we did not manage to complete shooting or editing the film.
All our reels of film were held up in Hollywood, where they had been developed and printed.
Later they landed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
They were turned over to us only a short time ago... after nearly half a century of negociations.
Eisenstein and Tisse are no longer with us... but what they did belongs to the living.
You will see the film... as Eisenstein conceived it... and as we planned it.
We do not know what the great director... would have done with the picture today.
But using his script and drawings, we have tried... to get as close as possible to what he had in mind.
The film was to consist of several parts... some close to being documentary and some acted.
On the whole, it was intended to be... a colourful film symphony of Mexico.
QUE VIVA MEXICO!
"Prologue"
The time in the prologue... is eternity.
It could all be taking place today... or have happened 20 years ago... or even a thousand years ago.
"The text is by Eisenstein.
It is read by S. Bondarchuk."
Stone.
Gods.
People.
A land of sacred ruins and huge pyramids.
Men and women with the features of their ancestors.
The pagan temples of holy cities.
A kingdom of death... where the past dominates the present.
And faces like those hewn in stone- like those... of the Mexicans of old.
Symbolic reminder of the past:
A funeral amidst dead ruins.
In total bondage... to the idea of death, of man's physical end.
Tropical Tehuantepec.
Here time flows slowly... to the accomplishment of the rustle of the palm fronds.
The way of life remains unchanged for centuries.
At its dawn, the world must have been full... of the same regal indolence.
"The Sandunga"
Girls sing the sandunga as they daydream of the future.
Full of pride in her youthful beauty.
Concepcion.
Her most cherished dream - a gold necklace.
A dream shared by every girl in Tehuantepec.
The necklace is her dowry, her key to marital bliss.
The woman works, she chooses a husband for herself... and she brings him into their new house.
Matriarchate.
Rule by the women.
Here the girls go to work early and save every copper... to acquire a necklace of gold coins... by the time they are 16 or 18.
Concepcion needs one more gold coin - just one - for her dream to be realized.
May your necklace bring you happiness!
Abundio, the object of Concepcion's affection.
Isn't this what you wanted,
Concepcion?
What you dreamed of for so long?
The matter passes into the hands... of the mothers and matchmakers.
They inspect the dowry.
How many coins in the necklace?
Are they pure gold?
The whole population of Tehuantepec... takes part in the event.
A slow, semi-vegetative existence.
A way of life... that has not changed over the centuries.
As the years go by, new flowers blossom.
"Fiesta"
The action of this story is set... during the Feast of the Holy Virgin of Guadalupe.
But this is also an annual reminder... of Spain's conversion of Mexico... into a colony of bloodshed and suffering.
In the 16th century.
Cortes conquered Mexico
The monks who came with him wiped out pagan cults... with fire and sword.
On pyramids once crowned by Aztec and Toltec temples... the Spaniards erected
Catholic churches... so as not to change the routes of the pilgrims... who had been coming there for thousands of years.
A mystery play, in which the pilgrims who enact it... portray the sufferings of Jesus.
Sharp prickles penetrate the bodies... of those who make crosses out of cactus stems... and, with these tied on their shoulders... crawl for hours to the top of the pyramid.
Masks of devils, pagan gods... and Spanish conquistadors side by side.
The dance goes on from dawn to dusk.
Without a pause.
Over and over again... they repeat the same steps... in honor of the Holy Virgin.
Or perhaps - who knows - of a more ancient goddess - the awesome mother of gods
Then the gory finale, the bullfight.
Introduced by the Spaniards... and now a national spectacle of the Mexicans.
David Liseaga, a famous Mexican matador.
His younger brother.
Baronito, a picador.
They call on their mother... to say good-bye to her... perhaps for the last time.
Today is a day when the toreros will kill bulls... in honor of the Virgin.
The chosen queens of the bullfight.
The razor's edge... between death and victory.
Among the local belles...
Baronito catches sight of his lady love...
Se? Ora Calderon.
What else is there for the poor picador to do?
Mexico, tender and lyrical.
And also cruel.
Above the high hacienda walls... floats a plaintive song.
The peons beg the Holy Virgin to ease their sufferings... on the day now dawning.
The time: The beginning of the 20th century... during the reign of dictator Porfirio Diaz.
"Maguey"
Native to the hilly country of the state of Hidalgo... is a large cactus named maguey.
These lands... are a part of the Tetlapayac hacienda... in Llanos de Apam.
Their lot, day after day, is to suck out... the thick juice from the heart of the cactus.
The juice will ferment and be ready to drink.
The strong, milky white beverage is called pulque.
Sebastian, a peon, is at work in the fields.
His betrothed, Maria, is brought by her parents.
Felicio, Sebastian's younger brother.
The landlords and his friends.
Every bride-to-be on the estate must be shown to the master.
The old man's daughter Sara... arrives with her cousin.
A family holiday.
The landlord celebrates.
Maria is forgotten.
The naive girl is unaware of what is in store for her.
Fate takes the form of a drunken guest.
Hatred sparks a plot.
Three of his comrades and Felicio, his brother-
They will help him to take revenge.
They want to free Maria.
Slumbering Mexico. Enslaved Mexico
Fermenting Mexico
And finally, fighting revolutionary Mexico
But that last part remained undone
The picture's small budget was used up... and shooting came to an end.
We returned home.
"Soldadera" was intended to depict Mexico... during the uprising of 1910 a country engulfed in the flames of civil war... divided into hostile camps... and then united by the victory of the revolution.
The Mexican people at arms... were to be the heroes of this story.
Soldaderas are the wives of soldiers.
They broke into villages and captured provisions... to feed their weary men.
The soldaderas were always beside the men.
The soldadera to us was to have been... a symbol of Mexico itself - a symbol of land whose people came to realize... that strength lies in unity... and that they must unite to fight reaction.
"Epilogue"
The time. 1931
The place. Mexico.
Another holiday, the Day of the Dead.
On this day, November 2... the emblem of death and, above all, skulls... are everywhere.
The day begins with mourning for the dead.
Revelry in cemeteries, eating on gravestones...
Iovemaking in the cemetery shrubbery.
From candles and food in the graveyard... to a rollicking carnival.
The Mexican scorns death.
What is more... the Mexican mocks death.
Chocolate coffins complete with sugar corpse.
And at the day's end, all this goes... into the bronzed bellies of Mexican children.
A skull under a minister's top hat... a fireman's helmet, a policeman's cap... a general's cocked hat.
Not a cult of death this, not the stillness of stone... or the awesomeness of stone idols...
No!
But man's triumph over death through mockery of it.
The masks are removed.
Not sham skulls now but real ones.
The corpses of a doom class.
Whom will we see behind this mask?
A soldadera's son?
One of whose hands are destined to forge... a truly free Mexico?

"The End"
I hope our new Commander-in-Chief isn't the coward they say he is.
Whatever they say, Yamamoto is the kind of leader we need.
He believes in the value of the airplane.
But why a Vice-Navy Minister for such an important position?
Maybe the climate in Tokyo was detrimental to Yamamoto's health.
The Army is against him for opposing their policies.
So he runs away to sea. Now he has the entire fleet to guard him.
This order makes you
Commander-in-Chief.
The Imperial fleet consists of...
Save your breath, Yoshida.
Those details are in the documents.
You haven't changed!
With the Army controlling politics...
...your job as Navy Minister will be difficult.
Thank God you're here.
We know your life has been threatened.
I'm not that easy to kill.
Army hotheads are demanding an alliance with Germany.
That would be tragic for Japan.
As Navy Minister I will...
...continue to fight with the Army.
You are our last hope, Yoshida.
The Navy must stand firm against the alliance.
America is against the war we are waging in China...
...and angry that we are negotiating with the Germans.
Now we are threatened with an embargo of the raw materials we need.
Either we improve relations with the U.S. and withdraw from China...
...or find another source of raw materials here in Indo-China.
Why worry about threats from America?
President Roosevelt’s attention is on Europe...
...where Germany is winning a quick victory over the Allied Armies.
Now is the time to strike.
The British, the Dutch and the French are withdrawing their forces...
...from Southeast Asia to strengthen their armies in Europe.
We must be careful.
The Americans have an Army in the Philippines...
...and they have moved their Pacific
Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor.
Yes, and that fleet is a knife leveled at Japan's throat.
The Japanese ambassador just arrived.
He should be up shortly.
Thank you.
The Japanese are stalling, Henry.
You know that.
When Nomura took over as ambassador...
...I had some hopes of settling our differences.
But our meetings so far have been unproductive.
He brings me proposals,
I offer compromises.
He brings me counterproposals, and so on.
I tell you, Henry,
Nomura was sent here to buy time.
That's what he's doing, at our expense.
The president believes him to be a man of honor...
...that we can trust and deal with.
Mr. Ambassador, we meet again.
It is always a pleasure.
I assume you know Mr. Stimson, the head of our War Department.
Oh, yes, of course.
Mr. Ambassador.
I do hope, Mr. Stimson...
...your presence here does not indicate anything ominous.
Of course not, Mr. Nomura.
Mr. Nomura, won't you please sit down?
Thank you.
Well, since our last talk a week ago...
...I have received certain...
...shall we say...
...questions from my government...
...to put to you to clarify certain matters.
Good morning, Colonel.
There it is.
This machine let's us intercept every word between Tokyo...
...and all Japanese embassies.
The coded material is fed into that machine.
It goes round and round in there...
...and comes out here, decoded in Japanese.
All we have to do is translate it.
We decode this quicker than the Japanese embassy...
...right here in Washington.
No wonder you decided to call it
"Operation Magic."
- The latest intercept, sir.
- Thank you.
Things are getting a little hotter in the Pacific.
As long as we're sharing this assignment...
...take a look at this.
Behold the 12 apostles.
The chosen few are authorized to see the magic intercepts.
Hap Arnold, Chief of the Air Corps, isn't on the list.
No, and not one of our overseas commanders.
Excellent!
Who is in command of those torpedo planes?
Lt. Commander Fuchida, sir, from the carrier Akagi.
Send him this message from me.
"Congratulations on brilliant torpedo attack."
If we are forced into a war with America...
...Japan's only hope...
...is to annihilate the American Pacific fleet at the outset.
I wonder if we could use torpedo planes at Pearl Harbor?
Stand by.
Execute.
Look at that entrance to the harbor.
Sink one good-sized ship in the channel and you've bottled up our whole fleet.
You know as well as I do, this harbor is a mousetrap.
Fleet should have stayed in San Diego where it belongs.
I made the mistake to point that out to Roosevelt.
We're expected to obey orders.
We're also expected to exercise our own good judgement.
I didn't ask for the job.
Sorry, Kim, but this was my command, and it's become habit...
...to worry about the security of the fleet.
The British, flying some old biplanes...
...torpedoed and sank three Italian battleships at Taranto.
- Harbor very much like this one.
- Well...
...I share your concern, but CNO doesn't think it can happen here.
Why not?
A torpedo dropped from a plane plunges...
...to a depth of 75 feet or more before it levels off.
I know, and Pearl is only
40 feet deep.
I'm still worried, Kim.
Frankly, sir, I was stunned when I heard of your proposal.
You think the plan is reckless?
You suggest using torpedo planes against the American Fleet...
...but Pearl Harbor is too shallow for that.
Taranto is also a shallow harbor...
...but the British torpedoed and sank three Italian battleships there.
I know as well as you do that my plan is a gamble.
And it's risky, but we have no choice.
What I need immediately is a plan for such an attack.
Then we should consult with Genda...
...the new Air Staff Officer on the Akagi, a superb strategist.
Yes, I remember Genda.
We'll talk to him.
Glad to see you, Genda.
So this is the new Zero?
Type 21, with folding wings.
This means we can carry more fighters now.
This Zero is fast, manoeuvrable and has a long cruising range.
Better than the Messerschmitt or Spitfire?
Definitely. I've seen both in combat over London.
You outrank me, so it must be true.
Now that you're Staff Officer here, things will be tough.
You don't have to worry, you won't be here.
You're going to the Third Fleet with a promotion.
The Commander-in-Chief must think you're good!
Of course he does!
And I've got proof!
Here is his telegram.
Want to read it?
Ten-hut!
Do the planes have to be parked like that?
Way at the edge of the field.
Standard dispersal procedure, General.
In case of enemy air attack.
There are 130,000 Japanese on this island.
Our main problem is sabotage.
It'd be too easy for enemies to sneak in at night...
...and blow up every one of them if they're left out there.
Make a note, Fielder.
We'll have to make changes.
Yes, sir.
Ten-hut.
- Yes?
- Admiral Halsey's here to see you.
Send him in, please.
Blast me, break me, court-martial me, draw and quarter me...
...if you think they're gonna send my ships...
...on convoy duty in the Atlantic.
Kim, I think they've gone nuts in Washington.
How will I fight a task force if they send ...
...my ships to the Atlantic?
That damn ocean is a swimming hole compared to the Pacific.
What are we, a fighting fleet, or are these toy boats out here...
...so the Japs can buy them at Christmas?
All right, Bill, now ease it off.
It's not just you.
They asked for some of our tankers too.
How do they expect to feed these wagons...
...parked out here on this land-locked duck pond?
You're still planning on rotating half of them at sea?
I was.
Look, Kim, you've got to make them understand what's going on out here.
I'm gonna do everything I can, Bill.
Even go to the president.
By God, I knew there was at least one man...
...in this man's Navy who hadn't gone nuts.
"Gandhi" is still in hiding, sir.
A strange man, he works in his cabin like a hermit.
But he should be here.
Watanabe, go and ask him to join us.
When "Gandhi" concentrates on a plan, he is lost to this world.
Please don't bother me!
This is important...
...so I'm not going.
Genda's plan for attacking
Pearl Harbor...
...is foolproof. It's brilliant!
He stresses the importance of combat aircraft.
Just think of it.
We use six aircraft carriers...
...torpedo planes...
...high-level bombers, dive bombers.
Zero fighters for cover...
...go by the northern route, use the new torpedoes...
...we attack on a weekend.
Genda has thought of everything...
...refuelling...
...the weather....
And we go on to say,
"It should be noted that Japan ...
...has never preceded hostile action by a declaration of war.
We have concluded it possible that a fast-rated ...
...Japanese carrier force may arrive in Hawaii with no prior warning...
...from our intelligence service.
The most favourable time to the enemy would be dawn.
He probably would employ a maximum of six carriers...
...strike on a weekend.
- We recommend that the Air Corps..."
- I read it.
Yes, sir.
I appreciate the work that you and General Martin have put in.
These reports are very useful to General Short and myself.
General Martin, you don't pull any punches, do you?
"We recommend that the Air Corps...
...maintain a thorough
360-degree search...
...of the Hawaiian area during daylight.
This will require a force of
180 B-17 airplanes."
We can't search the sea approaches...
...unless we have the planes, sir.
One hundred and eighty B-17s?
For God's sakes, that's more than the number existing in the States.
It looks fine on paper, but that's not a paper fleet out there.
Squadron from the Enterprise.
Bill Halsey's working the tails off his men.
Wish we had more like him.
Makes the most of what he's got.
Doesn't keep asking for the moon.
Well, not one bomb anywhere near the target for the past hour.
Your pilots can see it, I suppose.
- Who's next?
- It's Anderson, sir.
Now, that's more like it.
- Maybe your boys finally get it.
- I hope so, sir.
Who's next?
Lieutenant Dickenson.
Tell Lieutenant Dickenson for me...
...he couldn't hit a bull in the butt with a bass fiddle.
Yes, sir.
Ten-hut.
- Carry on.
- Carry on.
This it?
Yes, sir. Our new radar.
It's a remarkable scientific achievement...
...capable of spotting an intruder on the sea or in the air...
...and at quite a range.
- Now, listen, Colonel, as you know, we're short on patrol planes.
We're gonna have to rely on this...
...thing to detect the enemy.
General, radar should do the job.
What's it doing here, not set up?
We're about to truck it up that mountain.
That peak up there is the ideal spot to put our main radar post.
At that height, we'd be clear of all interference.
Obviously.
But, sir, we can't get permission to put her up there.
Permission?
From the National Park Service
Department of Interior.
See, all of this belongs to the Hawaiian National Park.
The Hawaiian National Park?
Yes, sir. The Wildlife Preservation
Society is raising hell too.
And we can't get permission?
No, sir.
Not unless we want to fight them.
Fight them? You're damn right we're gonna fight them.
- Now you make a note of that, Fielder.
- Yes, sir.
Wildlife Preservation Society.
I feel like a damn fool.
Without even consulting me...
...our Army has decided to occupy Indo-China.
There is no hope for peace now.
I've said it before and I’ll keep on saying it...
...if we fight the Americans, we can't stop at Hawaii or San Francisco.
We'll have to march into Washington...
...and dictate peace terms in the White House!
Army hotheads who speak so lightly of war should think about that!
As I'm no longer Minister of the Navy,
I can do nothing.
I'm sorry.
Don't blame yourself.
The Army leaders are at fault, not you.
I must get back to the fleet.
There is a lot to be done.
It's no use, Hal.
I spoke to General Miles.
He took it up with General Marshall.
The order stands.
The president is off the ultra List.
Incredible.
Withholding information from the president.
Security found a copy of an intercept in a wastebasket at the White House.
Truth is, the brass don't trust some men close to the president.
Does anyone trust anyone anymore?
- Do you even trust your own wife?
- Do you?
Come to think of it, I believe I do.
Part two of No. 1390, Colonel.
Tokyo to embassies in Washington and Berlin.
Thank you, Miss Cave.
The Japanese are moving south to occupy French Indo-China.
- This is big trouble.
- Yeah.
Well, ultra list or not...
...someone has to tell the president about this one.
"Therefore, we will impose a full embargo...
...on all trade with Japan.
We do not anticipate immediate hostile action by Japan...
...but you get this information...
...so you may take appropriate precautionary measures."
"Appropriate precautionary measures."
What the hell does that mean?
Now, this is signed jointly by General Marshall and Admiral Stark.
Until we know how the Japanese will react, we're not gonna take chances.
- We go on full alert.
- Yes, sir.
Stark says they don't anticipate hostile action.
Why send a warning at all?
Damn it.
Damn it, why can't Washington give us the full inside story?
I'd sooner form my own opinion.
"Don't anticipate hostile action."
Well, all right, we'll go ahead.
Increase air and sub patrols, alert senior commanders.
Maybe out of this we can find out how well we can function.
Kaminsky.
This is Captain Earle.
Going on full alert.
Yes, captain.
We're going on full alert.
Notify all ship, sub and air patrols.
What the hell is going on here?
What are you doing?
Carrying out orders.
General Short's concern is sabotage.
All aircraft not ready for flight from now on...
...will be parked in the center...
...so they can be kept under guard.
Suppose there's an air raid.
They hit one plane, and it all goes up in flames.
I'm sorry. General's orders.
Today's war games...
...of a theoretical attack on Pearl Harbor...
...clearly show the need for six carriers in the attack force.
The General Staff...
...wants to limit us to only three carriers.
We must have six!
If we reduce our striking force...
...from six carriers to only three...
...our mission will fail.
Before attacking anything else, we should attack our General Staff.
We believe in aircraft, but they cling to the ancient theory...
...that decisive naval engagements must be fought between battleships.
Unless we dispel this myth...
...we'll never get their approval.
They are not the only believers in the "battleship theory."
Many officers here today also support the idea.
I'm one of them. We'll soon have two new unsinkable battlewagons...
...each with a displacement of
65,000 tons and huge guns.
Anything that floats can be sunk!
The "unsinkable" ship is a myth.
The war in Europe is being decided by the airplane.
There can be no νictory on land or sea, without control of the air!
I have been chosen to command this task force.
And I consider this operation risky.
How can we travel 3500 miles to Hawaii without being detected?
This mission will fail unless we achieve complete surprise.
My ships can't carry fuel for a trip there and back.
Stopping to refuel increases the possibility of detection.
I am confident that our ships will reach Hawaii safely.
You are too cautious. The case for using six carriers is sound.
To criticize the plan is defeatist!
No more bickering! As long as I am Commander-in-Chief...
...Pearl Harbor will be attacked!
I am aware that this is a dangerous gamble.
But we can't afford the luxury of playing it safe now!
Gentlemen, whether we adopt this plan or not is no longer an issue.
Let us now decide how best to carry it out.
Fuchida's back! Fuchida's back!
Fuchida! What a surprise!
I'm your new Air Commander, so treat me well.
You're joking. How did you rate another promotion?
Well, exceptional people get exceptional treatment!
This ship is crawling with Admirals.
Something important must be happening.
We have called you here...
...to explain the purpose of a new training program.
This, of course, is a matter of strictest secrecy.
It looks just like Pearl Harbor, doesn't it?
And that area down there looks like Ford island, eh?
Beautiful!
Navy pilots attract geisha girls but they frighten the fish.
It's not an ideal radar sight, but at least we got a permit.
Let's get the other units working.
Easier said than done.
What do you mean?
We have to get all six units adjusted and link them by phone to headquarters.
That means training men to operate an information center...
...so they know what to do with the information.
Take it easy, Murph.
- You'll figure it out.
- Yeah, I'll figure it out.
Don't just stand there.
You know how to operate this thing.
We know the theory.
Let's put that theory into practice.
- Switch on.
- Yes, sir.
Stay put and keep watching the screen.
In two hours, close down.
I'll send a truck to pick you up.
Excuse me, sir, but what are we watching for?
Anything unusual.
Any large blip coming from the sea.
Colonel, if we do spot something, what do we do?
Report it to headquarters, damn it.
- How, sir?
- What?
We haven't got a telephone, sir.
There's a gas station a mile down the road.
They must have a phone.
We got 183 combat planes on this base, General.
The way they're parked now, a one-eyed monkey hanging from a balloon...
...could scatter them to hell with one hand grenade.
General Short gave the order.
Come in.
- Sir, Lieutenants Taylor and Welch.
- Okay, send them in.
You two men get in your planes and fly over to Haleiwa.
Yes, sir.
What are our orders when we get there?
Just sit tight.
Listen for the phone. That's all.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Haleiwa is one of the subsidiary fields.
We send those two up there, two more here.
Only way I know to disperse a few of the planes.
If I'd get away with it, I'd send all to the neighbour islands.
- You know why we're being transferred.
- Them poker games.
- Been winning too often.
- Yeah.
Some sucker loses his shirt, so he bitches to the General.
That's it.
It's hard to believe the Emperor agreed...
...to fix a date by which the final decision must be made...
...between war and peace.
His majesty's signature is a mere formality.
The cabinet is responsible for all matters of national policy.
The Emperor recently read a poem to his Ministers to show how he feels.
"If all people are brethren...
...then why are the winds and the waves so restless?"
"If all people are brethren...
...then why are the winds and the waves so restless?"
This clearly shows how much the Emperor wants to avoid a war.
Yes, he has urged us to solve our differences with Washington.
But, sir, the deadline is October.
Can a solution be found by then?
Perhaps. But if we fail...
...if war does come...
...tell me frankly, from the Navy's Viewpoint...
...what are our chances against the Americans?
If we must, we can raise havoc with them for a year.
After that, I can guarantee nothing.
Mr. Prime Minister, I hope you will continue the negotiations.
Please remember, there is no last word in diplomacy.
Tokyo has ignored my repeated inquiries...
...and still has made no reply...
...to the compromise proposals offered by Secretary Hull.
The war that I have dreaded for so long...
...may soon become a reality.
Nomura has offered his resignation several times.
But Tokyo won't let him quit.
Instead they're sending a second ambassador, Kurusu, to help him out.
Do you really think this Kurusu can do any good?
Well, I doubt it, Frank.
He's hardly the most tactful choice.
When he was ambassador in Berlin...
...he signed the Axis Pact on behalf of Japan.
You will sail from Hittakopu Bay on November 26 under my strict orders.
The code, "Climb Mt. Niitaka" will be confirmation to go on.
We have tentatively set the date for the attack...
...on Sunday, December 7th,
Hawaiian time.
But you must understand that we are still negotiating in Washington.
If a peaceful solution is found...
...the fleet will be recalled at once.
Once at sea, to turn back would be a disgrace!
It would destroy the morale of the men!
They're in a high state of readiness, physically and psychologically.
Enough! If any commander is inclined to reject an order to return...
...when the path for peace is open...
...let him resign now!
Finally, gentlemen...
...many misinformed Japanese...
...believe that America is a nation divided, isolationist...
...and that Americans are only interested...
...in enjoying a life of Luxury...
...and are spiritually and morally corrupt.
But that is a great mistake.
If war becomes inevitable...
...America would be the most formidable foe that we have ever fought.
I've lived in Washington and studied at Harvard...
...so I know the Americans are a proud and just people.
- You sick or something?
- No.
I've been piecing together this batch of new intercepts.
- A frightening picture is taking shape.
- Oh?
Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu asked their government...
...to extend a deadline for suspending negotiation between Japan and America.
- You remember that?
- Yeah.
Now, according to this latest intercept...
...Tokyo wants to conclude negotiations with us...
...no later than November 29...
...after which, and I quote:
"Things are automatically going to happen."
Now...
...look at this intelligence report from the British.
Five Japanese troop transports with naval escort...
...were sighted off Formosa, heading south.
We've been monitoring their fleet.
Most of it seems to be on home waters.
I'm not so sure.
I'd make a bet they're going to attack us.
Japan is going to attack us.
The 29th is only four days off.
The 30th is on a Sunday.
We're gonna be attacked on Sunday, the 30th of November.
The pieces fit together.
But can you prove it?
No. But I'm convinced I'm right.
Miss Cave? Get me General Marshall.
Oh, General Marshall's at Fort Benning, sir.
Then get me the secretary of war.
I've got the evidence, AI.
And I'm gonna make the brass around here admit I'm right.
Bratton's analysis makes sense.
His facts are undeniable.
Henry, I'm washing my hands of the whole matter.
From now on, it's in your hands...
...and in those of the Navy Department.
I'll call the president.
A message declaring a full alert will be sent out.
Sir?
General Marshall anticipated an emergency like this.
Before he left to attend manoeuvres...
...he made out this alert order.
As you know, after the Cabinet decided to send Japan to war...
...they held an Imperial Conference at the palace.
His Majesty, who participated in this conference...
...which is a mere formality...
...was depressed and silent all through the meeting.
Today His Majesty will ask the customary questions about the war...
...and you will make the traditional replies.
There can be no more tragic ritual than this conversation...
...between His Majesty who does not want war...
...and Your Excellency, who has opposed it so vigorously.
As Minister of the Imperial Household...
...I am not allowed to attend this ritual.
Fortunately for me...
...I won't have to witness this tragic ceremony.
I can go no farther.
The Military Attaché will take you from here.
Sir, a message!
"From Admiral Yamamoto,
Commander-in-Chief, Combined Fleet...
...to Admiral Nagumo, Third Fleet...
...climb Mount Niitaka."
Hostilities will begin on December 7th...
...exactly as scheduled.
Read this back to me.
"Japanese future action unpredictable.
But hostile action possible at any moment.
If hostilities cannot be avoided...
...the United States desires that
Japan commit the first overt act."
Wait a minute. Read that again.
"If hostilities cannot be avoided, the United States desires...
...that Japan commit the first overt act.
This shouldn't be construed as restricting you...
...to a course of action jeopardizing your defense.
Prior to hostile Japanese action...
...you are directed to undertake reconnaissance...
...and other measures as you deem necessary.
These measures should be carried out...
...so as not to alarm the civil population ...
...or disclose intent. By order of General George C. Marshall."
"Not to alarm the civil population."
What do you make of it?
Well...
...if you ask me, sir, it's double talk.
But the chief of staff doesn't go in for double talk.
- We're going on alert.
- Again?
But the men are confused.
So many alerts.
- Damn it, unconfuse them.
- Yes, sir.
"Japanese forces may attack the Philippines...
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula and Borneo.
This dispatch is to be considered a war warning."
Well, there it is, gentlemen.
You now have as much information as I do.
That's the second warning in three days.
"Japanese forces may attack the Philippines...
...Thailand, the Kra Peninsula and Borneo."
They don't mention us.
That's correct. I think it should be considered significant.
Well, gentlemen...
...we have a job to do.
Washington wants us to send a squadron of fighters to Midway.
And another squadron to Wake.
When can you sail?
Well, the Enterprise can sail tomorrow morning.
I'll need a day or two. We're just completing repairs on the Lexington.
Hurry things along, John.
I want you out there to probe.
I want planes up in the air morning and afternoon.
I want a report on any sign of hostile ships.
Understood.
Do you want battleships along?
Hell, no. They're too slow.
If we're gonna probe, let's probe.
We don't want anything holding us up.
You're right, but I'm not ready to commit them myself.
Not until I know when and where.
Do you plan to keep half the fleet at sea while the carriers are gone?
No, it's too risky.
I'll have to keep the fleet here at Pearl while you're away.
Get out. Get back as soon as you can.
I don't like the idea of having my battleships without air cover.
Yes, sir.
Admiral.
Kim.
Level with me.
I want a clear directive.
If I run into a Jap ship, what action do I take?
Use your common sense.
That's the best damn order I ever had.
If I see so much as a sampan there...
...I'll blow it out of the water.
"Intelligence Report,
U.S. ships now at Pearl Harbor...
...six battleships, three light cruisers...
...16 destroyers and one aircraft carrier."
No information about the other American carriers.
You know today's date?
December 1st.
Yes, but tonight will be November 30th.
When we cross the International Date Line...
...we'll push the clock ahead five hours...
...and turn the calendar back a full day, making today yesterday.
Don't be silly!
Today can't change into yesterday!
You're not too intelligent but I'll try to explain...
...so listen carefully.
It's a little before 1300 hours, right?
So why are we making supper at this hour?
1300? It should be lunchtime.
Right! And the Date Line makes up for that time difference...
...by turning today into yesterday.
I don't quite understand, but if we see the enemy across that line...
...I guess it would be useless to shoot at them.
Because how can today's shells hit yesterday's enemy?
What is it this time, getting me over here?
Tokyo has alerted their embassy to stand by...
...for a very long message in 14 parts.
Look, Rufe, you scared me and everybody else last week.
We're not doing that again, are we?
You should see this.
It's the latest report on those
Japanese troop transports.
Remember those troop ships?
They're still heading south with an escort...
...only 14 hours from the coast of Malaya.
What about their aircraft carriers?
We don't know.
Intelligence was keeping track of them until recently.
Now we've lost them.
Look, Rufe, try to put yourself in their minds.
Where do you think I have been the past week, night and day?
I am still convinced they're going to attack us.
What can we do that we aren't doing already?
I don't know about you, but I know what I'm gonna do.
Where is everybody?
Oh, it's past 12, sir.
They've already gone.
- Get them back.
- On the weekend?
Yes, on the weekend.
"Only specially screened members of your communications staff...
...are to be permitted to process the 15-part message...
...and prepare the typed translation."
It will be difficult without the help of a skilled typist.
The situation right now is extremely delicate.
We must be prepared...
...to have each part of the message decoded as soon as it comes in.
I'll alert the code room.
We'll reach Point D soon, sir.
From Point D proceed to Point E.
Battle speed.
So this is the sound of Hawaii?
Disappointing news, our main targets, the American carriers...
...have left Pearl Harbor.
This completes 13 parts?
Yes, Tokyo is holding the final part till morning.
I wonder why.
It's almost 9.
Harry, I'm going to make the rounds with what we have here.
Thank God the president's back on the list.
Have Brotherhood call me when the missing part is in.
Right.
You're late.
- Well, I was...
- Please, take me to the White House.
If you told me we were invited to the
White House, I would've dressed.
You know Mrs. Roosevelt.
She's informal personally, but a stickler for protocol...
Darling, will you shut up and drive?
Once more!
Steady.
Great! We just sank the Nevada!
Pennsylvania!
Oklahoma!
Enterprise!
No, you idiot!
It's your own flagship!
Well?
Captain Wilkinson's.
Did you see the president?
No, I saw Harry Hopkins.
And did he read the whatever it is?
No, he doesn't have the key.
I gave the pouch to our Naval aide,
Lieutenant Schulz.
He took it in to the president.
And the president has a key,
I suppose?
Of course he has.
And did Lieutenant Schulz say anything?
He said, "Thank you."
Darling, step on it, will you?
If we can see nothing, then neither can American patrol planes.
I'm more concerned about a submarine detecting us.
Dead on schedule.
Admiral Stark can't be reached.
Should I take it to chief of staff?
It's after 10, General Marshall always retires early.
I see no reason to disturb Marshall with something that's incomplete.
- Wait till you have the final part.
- Yes, sir.
If you're so concerned...
...why don't we call chief of war plans,
Admiral Turner?
His telephone doesn't answer, sir.
- You don't happen to know where he is?
- No idea.
The president has already discussed it with me.
He sent a personal message to the emperor.
But when the final part of this comes in, I'd like to see it then.
- Good night, commander.
- Good night, sir.
I was starved. I'll bet you are.
Oh, thank you, dear.
Can't you tell me anything?
Even a hint?
You'd think the world was falling apart.
Admiral Stark talked to the president.
What did the president say?
He sent a personal message to the emperor.
Gordy. Ed.
We got those B-17s coming in from California in the morning.
Honolulu radio will stay on the air all night...
...so the planes can home in.
You and I had better be in that control tower at 7:30 sharp.
- Yes, sir.
- Dear.
- Tyler, I've got a job for you.
- Sir.
Report to the new radar center at Fort Shafter at 0400.
At 4:00 in the morning?
From 4 to 7 a.m.
Our marvel of science only operates for three hours.
Lucky boy. Lucky boy!
Captain, how's it feel?
First command, first patrol.
Just fine, Mr. Young.
In fact, I think
I'll turn in for a while.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
The Commander-in-Chief has sent a message...
...wishing us good luck.
That, plus the Imperial Proclamation...
...has undoubtedly stirred your loyalty to the Empire.
The success of this mission...
...depends on surprise.
If we achieve it...
...the code words "Tora, Tora, Tora," will be sent out.
Now that the hour for battle draws near...
...I will not burden you with the usual pep talk.
Instead I shall hoist the famous "Z" flag...
...beneath which, Commander-in-Chief
Togo led his fleet to Victory...
...in the historic battle against the Russians.
Here you are.
Kramer.
AI, listen to this.
The fourteenth part.
"Will the ambassadors please submit our reply...
...to the United States government at precisely 1p.m...
...December 7th, your time."
1p.m.?
"Precisely 1p.m., your time."
I'll be right over.
Look at the president's message.
I should have had it hours ago.
As you know, communications have been delayed ...
...and frequently garbled lately.
Or deliberately interfered with.
Gene, call the foreign minister.
Tell him I want an immediate audience with the emperor.
Why is this so important?
Does this Roosevelt message say anything new?
It merely proposes a heart-to-heart exchange...
...between the two Chiefs of State.
It could start negotiations afresh.
It's too late for that.
It's just as well the message didn't come a day or two earlier.
What do I tell Ambassador Grew?
You are Foreign Minister!
Report to the palace alone with the message.
"After deciphering...
...part 14...
...destroy at once...
...your cipher machine...
...all codes...
...and secret documents."
Translate this immediately.
- Give a copy to Kramer when he comes.
- Yes, sir.
I've got to get the hell out of here.
Hey, look at this.
Finally got one.
Communication center.
It even works.
That's great.
Opana Point, communications check.
Are you reading us?
Coming in loud and clear.
Where's the General?
It's Sunday, sir.
This is Colonel Bratton.
Connect me with Chief of Staff,
General Marshall.
Yes, at his quarters, Fort Myer.
Chief of staff's quarters,
Sergeant Aguirre speaking.
Yes, Colonel Bratton.
I'm sorry, sir, the General isn't here.
Where he always is this time Sunday morning.
- Where's Colonel Bratton?
- Gone to see General Marshall.
He left this for you, sir.
Here is another part of the message, sir.
We are instructed to submit the message at 1:00 p.m. today.
One p.m.?
The 14th part of this intercept
Kramer just delivered...
...indicates to me the Japanese are going to attack.
None of us doubt that war is coming.
We know they have an expeditionary force heading south.
Sir, as hostilities seem imminent...
...I recommend you telephone
Admiral Kimmel ...
...in Hawaii.
No.
I better call the president first.
Now, if you'll all please excuse me?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
The men are in good spirits, sir.
They are eager to go.
Yes, they are eager because they do not know the taste of battle.
The mechanics asked me to give you this for good luck at Pearl Harbor.
Bring her into the wind.
"The Japanese government regrets to have to notify...
...the American government...
...that, in view of the attitude of the American government...
...it cannot but consider that it is impossible to reach...
...an agreement through further negotiations."
- Sir.
- Hm?
- There are supplemental messages.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen, I am convinced the Japanese intend to attack...
...at or shortly after 1:00 today.
- I'll alert all Pacific commands.
- Yes, sir.
Colonel Bratton, just a minute.
Take this to communications center.
We will follow that ship into Pearl Harbor.
Come in.
Captain, can you come to the bridge?
Very well.
Sub contact, Mr. Goepner?
- We're not sure.
- What ship?
The Navy tug Antares.
Look astern of her, captain.
She's towing a target raft.
Look between the ship and the raft, sir.
That, Mr. Goepner, is a submarine.
She's sneaking through the net into the harbor. General Quarters.
- Sound General Quarters.
- All engines ahead, full.
Come left 15 degrees, sir.
- Tell Antares we're attacking.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Flags, tell Antares we're attacking.
- Mount one, commence firing.
- Mount one, commence firing.
- Stand by to roll depth charges.
- Stand by to roll depth charges.
Roll one.
Roll two.
Notify Com-14 we dropped depth charges on a sub in our security zone.
Aye, aye, sir.
Captain Earle speaking.
- We have a message from the ward.
- All right, read it to me.
"Have dropped depth charges on sub operating in our security zone."
We've had so many of these false sightings, Kaminsky.
But this is the real thing, sir.
Closer than any previous sighting.
Just off the harbor entrance.
You and I know the skipper of that destroyer is a green kid.
I'll pass it to Admiral Block.
With all due respect, sir, I think we should alert all commanders.
Confirmation, Kaminsky.
I want confirmation.
The sunburst reminds me of our flag, a good omen.
Ed, this is hot.
General Marshall wants it sent to all commanders by the fastest route.
Right.
The General's handwriting, it's hard to read.
You're gonna have to help me with it, Rufe.
Hey, I'm picking up Honolulu on the radio.
Check your direction-finder dial.
It's coming from five degrees to port, sir.
Okay, keep riding that beam.
Major, I picked up some great music from Honolulu.
That's fine, pipe it through.
Okay.
Where's the damn chow truck?
Shut the thing down, George.
It's already after 7.
Hey, Joe, come here.
What do you make of that?
I've been watching it for minutes.
It's moving in, fast.
I've never seen anything that big.
- Looks like two main pulses.
- Hey, Joe, I got it.
I make that about 140 miles north, three degrees east.
Don't make sense, we got no planes out that far.
We gotta contact the information center.
Our problem is over at 7:00.
The center might make some sense out of it.
Okay, suit yourself.
Information center.
Yeah? I don't know, Mac, we're all closed down here.
Is that right? Hang on a minute.
Lieutenant, sir.
Lieutenant Tyler.
Sir, this is Private Elliot,
Opana Point.
There's a large formation of planes coming in...
...140 miles, three degrees east.
Yeah?
Well, don't worry about it.
The boys at Opana Point must have picked up the B-17s...
...coming in from the mainland.
- He said not to worry about it.
- Come on, let's go eat.
Colonel, I sent this to Manila, the canal zone and San Francisco...
...but the direct channel to Hawaii is out.
Atmospherics again?
Yes, sir, it's real bad today.
We could give it to the Navy.
What makes you think their atmospherics are better?
- Send it as a telegram.
- Yes, sir.
Our ultimatum should be delivered in
Washington before the attack begins.
I hope everything is on schedule.
Don't worry, sir.
The Emperor insists...
...that we follow the rules of the Geneva Convention.
Our declaration of war will be delivered...
...at 1:00 p.m.,
30 minutes before the attack begins.
The typing still isn't finished.
We'll have to postpone our 1:00 appointment with Secretary Hull.
Do you mean a submarine was sighted over half an hour ago...
...and that it's taken this long to report it to me?
I don't care if it still hasn't been confirmed.
I should've been informed after the ward radioed a first report.
A submarine that close is a serious matter.
A very serious matter.
Get the confirmation, all the reports to my office.
I mean, right now.
Have my driver get the car.
Aye, aye, sir. Oh, sir...
...should I tell General Short you'll miss the golf date?
No, damn it, get my car.
A message for the General at Fort Shafter.
- Is it marked urgent?
- No.
It's a little bumpy, Davey...
...but you have to fly in all kinds of weather.
Sure, Miss Fort.
Don't let the nose drop.
That's better.
You're doing just fine.
I'm taking over, Davey.
Warrant Officer Mizuki, signal all planes, "prepare to attack."
A signal from Fuchida,
"objective sighted, preparing to attack."
Everything is strangely quiet.
The American anti-aircraft batteries haven't fired a shot!
And no enemy fighters over the harbor, sir!
We've done it!
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"
"Tora! Tora! Tora!"
Stand by.
Execute.
Get his number.
I'll report him for safety violations.
Come on!
Alert all commands:
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.
This is no drill."
General Quarters. General Quarters.
Man your stations. Man your stations.
Sir.
Battle stations. Battle stations.
Fire your gun. Fire at will.
That bastard!
Station six, man your pump.
Plane to starboard.
You bastard!
Pearl Harbor is being attacked.
- Pearl Harbor?
- Pearl Harbor is being bombed.
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.
Go back to your quarters.
Pearl Harbor's being attacked.
What in the hell is going on?
Why wasn't the Army notified?
Did anyone think to inform Washington?
I thought so.
- General.
- Put all units on a full war footing.
Alert the territorial guard.
Open a command post at Aliamanu Crater.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be right down.
Oh, my God.
The island's under attack.
Those bastards will kill us all.
Men, get to the armory.
Get guns, ammunition.
- You too, lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.
- Operator.
- Duarte Air Field.
All the phone lines are jammed.
Well, try the radio again.
Hose down that plane.
Run for it.
Run, run!
There's Hickam.
Major, I heard something funny on the Honolulu radio.
What kind of traffic control is this?
The radio said something about an attack.
They're Japs, sir.
What a way to fly into a war.
Unarmed and out of gas.
Oboe leader to Oboe flight.
We've flown into the middle of a war.
Get out fast.
Anywhere. If you can't make Hickam, try Bellows or Wheeler.
Sir, we've been hit. Nothing serious.
They shot one circuit box.
The landing light isn't working.
Better use the hand crank. Hurry.
- Major.
- Yeah.
One wheel is stuck.
Well, jolt it loose. We're going in.
- I tried.
- Try again!
Here they come. Fire!
Tell them to stop shooting at us!
We're Americans.
Major, no go, sir.
Like I said, it's a hell of a way to fly into a war.
- Run for it!
- Hurry up!
Tower to B-17, there's a Jap on your tail.
Goose your engine and get out.
Have damage control report all damages.
Sir, if we stay here we're gonna fry.
Okay, sergeant, let's get the men down.
All right, you guys, let's go.
Where the hell are our fighters?
Captain, the main fuel tanks are fractured.
Lower deck's flooded, we're listing eight degrees.
Counter flood, counter flood.
You wanted confirmation, captain?
Take a look.
There's your confirmation!
"Oklahoma, capsized.
Nevada's taken a torpedo forward and is down to a head.
West Virginia, subjected to six torpedo hits and several deck fires.
Raleigh and Helena damaged and listing."
The California, two torpedoes, fires all around, temporarily abandoned.
I've just come from her.
It's spent, sir.
Would've been merciful had it killed me.
A message from
Flight Leader Fuchida.
"Have inflicted serious damage on numerous battleships."
Better than we had dreamed!
Where are our priority targets...
...the American carriers?
Mr. Secretary.
"Air raid. Pearl Harbor.
This is no drill."
No, this can't be true.
They must mean the Philippines.
No, sir. It's Pearl.
Get me the White House, the direct line.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Hull will see you in a moment. Please be seated.
Mr. President, has this been confirmed?
Then, sir,
I'd like you to have it confirmed ...
...before I receive Nomura and Kurusu.
They're waiting outside.
Operator. Operator.
Get me Haleiwa field. Fast.
George, get a hold of a car, a truck, anything.
I'm calling Haleiwa to get them to start our planes. Go.
Right!
Battleship on the left, sir!
It's the Nevada. She's making a run for the sea!
If we sink her in the channel, the harbor will be blocked for months!
Recommend course 2-3-0, sir.
- Very well. Stay at 2-3-0.
- Stay at 2-3-0, sir.
Take cover!
More hose! More hose!
- More water. More! More water.
- Abandon ship! Abandon ship!
- Abandon ship! Abandon Ship!
- Over the side!
Can't get through the outer channel in this shape.
She goes down here, she'll block the south channel.
We'll have to beach her there so she's clear.
File these.
G-5.
- I need five copies each.
Messenger.
- Take this to General Short's office.
- Right.
File these.
Corporal.
This has to be decoded for the General.
Take it to the decoding room.
Ask them to send it back soon.
Yes, sir.
Run!
Run for it!
Drop the hose and get the ladders and axes.
What are you waiting for?
- We got no water.
- Why? What's wrong?
It's the Arizona.
She cut the pipes in the mains.
The tanker in the ocean there is full of aviation fuel.
If it goes, we'll blow up half the harbor.
Come on, hurry up!
Get out of the way!
Hey, look out!
In all my 50 years of public service...
...I have never seen a document so crowded with infamous falsehoods...
...and distortions...
...on a scale so huge...
...that I never imagined until today...
...that any government on this planet...
...was capable of uttering them.
Mr. Hull.
Go.
What's the matter? Why in hell doesn't the next wave take off?
But, sir, no one has given the order.
We've knocked out the American airfields...
...sunk four battleships, heavily damaged three more.
Sir, Rear Admiral Yamaguchi's carrier has signaled!
"Attack group ready for takeoff."
Unfortunately, the American carriers were not at Pearl Harbor.
Since we don't know where they are...
...we can't use our limited supply of fuel to look for them.
We must not forget that enemy submarines will be searching for us.
We have been lucky so far.
No take-off signal yet?
There is a signal now!
It says, "All ships head for Japan as soon as our planes return."
It can't be!
It must be a mistake!
We cannot turn back now.
We must destroy the American carriers and their dry docks...
...no matter how long it takes!
You're wrong. Our mission has been completely accomplished.
This task force is vital to us.
It is my duty to return it intact.
This war is just beginning.
We have a long way to go.
Yes, all right.
This came from the decoding room, a cablegram from the War Department.
Get a copy to Admiral Kimmel.
Pardon me, admiral.
- From Washington.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen.
"The Japanese are presenting at 1p.m...
...Eastern Standard Time today...
...what amounts to an ultimatum.
Just what significance the hour set may have, we do not know...
...but be on alert accordingly."
Signed ...
...George C. Marshall, chief of staff.
My God.
This leaves the Navy with only two combat groups in the Central Pacific.
Ours and the Lexington.
We don't want to get caught like they did.
I don't intend to.
When can you be ready for sea again?
We can fuel and provision and be under way before dawn.
Good. That's good.
Here is an announcement from the
Navy Department released December 7th.
"Before daybreak today, the Imperial Navy successfully launched...
...a large-scale air raid against the American Pacific Fleet in Hawaii."
We salute the Commander-in-Chief of our Fleet...
...Admiral Yamamoto.
I had intended to deal a fatal blow to the American fleet...
...by attacking Pearl Harbor...
...immediately after Japan's official declaration of war.
But according to the American radio,
Pearl Harbor was attacked...
...55 minutes before our ultimatum...
...was delivered in Washington.
I can't imagine anything...
...that would infuriate the Americans more.
I fear all we have done...
...is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.
"THE STORY OF ADELE H."
"The story of Adele H. is true.
It is about events that really happened... and people that really existed."
The yearis 1863.
For 2 years now, the United States... had been torn apart by a civil war.
Will Great Britain recognize... the independence of the Southern Confederacy... and join in war against the Yankees?
Since 1862, British troops have been stationed... in the Canadian town of Halifax,, the capital of Nova Scotia... formerly the French Acadia.
Halifax, is gripped by a kind of fever.
The town's people are busy worrying... smuggling goods, and hunting Yankeespies.
While at theport, the British authorities... maintain a close check on European passengers... disembarking from the Great Eastern... the huge steamship also known as the "Floating City. "
- Good evening. Where are you from?
- Liverpool.
- Have you any papers?
- No, I don't.
- They let you embark in Liverpool?
- Yes.
- They let you embark in Liverpool?
- They let me.
If you had your papers in Liverpool, why haven't you got them now?
They were taken away from me when I got to New York.
Then we can't let you in.
They may be in New York, but this is Halifax.
We cannot let you in Halifax unless you've got papers.
I don't know the rules.
- I'm within my rights to search you.
- Please don't.
If you explain to me what they're for, maybe I won't have to.
It will be up to my superior officer to decide whether they let you in or not.
I need them, sir!
- Right, miss, Hotel Hampstead.
- Yes.
Very good.
- Give them to me.
- No. Is there anymore?
Whoa, boy, whoa.
Hampstead.
Is this the hotel?
This is it, miss.
No, I don't want to stay there.
Apart from the Halifax, there's only the Atlantic... which is much too expensive.
There isn't another hotel fit for a young lady to stay in.
- You should go to a boarding house.
- Oh, yes, please!
"Room And Board"
Good evening, Mrs. Saunders. I have a new lodger foryou, a nice young lady.
Thankyou, Mr. O'Brien.
- You can go in, miss.
- Thank you.
- Let me take your case, miss.
- Thank you.
- My name is Miss Lewly.
- Come in, Miss Lewly.
My name is O'Brien.
I'm always about if you want me.
- Thankyou very much.
- Good night.
"A. Lenoir - Notary Public"
Good day, sir.
My husband is a doctor,
Dr. Lenormand in Paris.
I've just arrived from France.
That's the reason I was sent to you.
I am very glad they did.
You know, I like France very much.
It will be a great pleasure for me to help you.
What exactly is troubling you?
I have a niece in France.
I'm very fond of her.
She's a rather romantic girl.
During a visit to England... she fell in love with a British officer...
Lieutenant Pinson of the 16th Hussars.
There was even talk of marriage between them.
Our family was not absolutely opposed to it... but because ofthe troubles in America...
Lieutenant Pinson had suddenly to embark with his regiment... for Halifax.
And since then, we've had no news of him at all... and my family wants me to find out what's happened to him.
I find it very upsetting... because Lieutenant Pinson is of no interest to me.
Lieutenant Pinson is of no interest to me.
All I want is my niece's happiness.
Well, I think you know everything now.
So you want me to look for this lieutenant.
Lieutenant Pinson.
But in a discreet way.
Yes, everyone has been saying so... even the other offiicers, that we have... a far better selection here than the military library... which is quite surprising, since we have far more difficulties... with the customs than you do.
But anyway, I hope to have those 2 books... in 1 week or 2 at the most.
Good, good. Thanks.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Lieutenant.
"Book Shop"
Good day, Madam.
Can I help you?
- Yes, I'd like some paper.
- Some note paper?
No. I need a ream.
I've a lot of writing to do.
I thought I recognized the officer who just left.
Wasn't it Lieutenant Pinson?
That's right, yes. He's a good customer of mine.
I had no idea he was in Halifax.
Oh, he's not been here for long... but he's already got himself quite a reputation.
Well, that's what they say in town.
Really?
That's what they say in town.
And what else do they say?
Oh, well, as far as I'm concerned... he's just another client.
But apparently he's been running up a few debts.
Anyway, he always pays cash here.
Pardon me, Madam--
Miss.
Miss. May he be a relation of yours?
Yes. He's my sister's brother-in-law.
But I seldom see him.
I'm not on good terms with my sister.
I understand, yes.
I'll take this one.
Miss, I also have a lending library by subscription.
Oh, really?
But I could always lend you some books...
- even if you don't subscribe.
- Thank you.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Miss.
Good evening, Mrs. Saunders.
Miss Lewly, would you share my supper?
My husband's helping out tonight... as a waiter at the Officers' Club banquet.
Will the English officers be there?
Yes. After all, the banquet's in their honor.
They're celebrating the arrival of the 16th Hussars.
In that case, my cousin should be there.
Your cousin? You have a cousin in Halifax?
Yes. Lieutenant Pinson.
I call him cousin, but we're not really related.
We grew up together. He's the son of our village clergyman.
To tell you the truth, he's been in love with me... since we were children. I never encouraged him.
We lost touch years ago.
But this could be an occasion to see him again.
Perhaps I could give you a letter for him, Mr. Saunders... a letter to give him.
Yes, of course.
I'll go and write it now. Please wait a few minutes.
Albert, my love... our separation has destroyed me.
Since you've left, I've thought of you every day.
I know you must be suffering as I am.
I've received none of your letters... and I'm sure that mine never reached you.
But today I'm here, Albert.
I'm on the same side of the ocean as you are.
Everything will begin anew.
I know that soon your arms will be around me.
I'm in the same city as you, Albert.
I'm waiting for you.
I love you.
Your Adele.
Oh, Miss, he must be a famous artist... the one who made these pictures.
It was my brother.
Do congratulate him.
I don't know anybody who can get a likeness like that.
Honestly, you'd say you were alive.
Oh, what a lovely picture.
Is that you?
No. No, it's my older sister.
Does she live in Europe?
She died a long time ago.
I'm sorry.
Leopoldine drowned a few months... after our mother sketched this portrait.
She was 19. She had just married.
They were out taking a boat ride.
Her husband died with her.
Our father was away when it happened.
He learned the news by chance from a newspaper.
He nearly went mad with grief.
And you... you must have been very unhappy.
Leopoldine was adored by the whole family.
How lovely she looks.
Her husband did all he could to save her.
And when he realized that she was lost... he chose to drown with her.
These are her jewels.
I always keep them with me.
Oh, no. No.
I could never wear them.
I understand you, Miss Adele.
You know, I always wanted brothers and sisters.
No, you don't understand me.
You don't know how lucky you were to be an only child.
This wind.
- I thought it would never end.
- You must be tired.
Yes, quite right.
- I saw your cousin this morning.
- You saw him?
- Yes.
- How did he look?
Well, he was dressed up to the nines.
Yes, I never have seen anybody looking so elegant.
What was he talking about?
Did you hear what he was saying?
He told funny stories.
Really funny ones.
He had them all laughing.
Even the footmen were in stitches.
The letter. Did you give the letter to Miss Lewly's cousin?
Yes, of course I did.
What are you waiting for?
Give Miss Adele her reply.
There was no reply.
The lieutenant read the letter but didn't want to answer it.
Oh.
It doesn't matter.
I didn't really expect a reply.
- What was there on the menu?
- It was General Doyle's chef-- you know the one-- who thought up the menu.
There was turtle soup, curried chicken... salmon... venison steaks... filet de sole in truffle sauce... artichokes with pear peppers... and Scotch grouse in whiskey.
Raspberry ice--
That letter, you know-- the lieutenant didn't even open it.
No.
He looked at the envelope, shrugged his shoulders... stuffed it into his pocket without reading it.
For a man in love, that's a funny way to behave.
Whoa. Whoa, there.
- This is the bank, Miss Lewly.
- Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.
Yes, I'm expecting a draft from Europe.
Yes, madam. The last desk over there.
Thank you.
Can I help you, miss?
Yes, I am expecting some letters and a draft from Europe.
- Your name, please?
- Miss Lewly.
- Here we are.
- Thank you.
This letter says I am to receive a money order.
I'm sorry, but money orders take longer to come through than ordinary mail.
I think you'll have to come back in about two weeks.
Two weeks.
Thank you.
My dear parents... if I left without a word... it was to avoid another one of those discussions... which even the simplest things seem to provoke in our family.
Were he to leave his post...
Lieutenant Pinson would jeopardize his future.
It is therefore impossible for me to come home now.
You know that I love him.
He loves me, too, and we wish to marry.
But I will do nothing until
I receive from each of you... a reply and your formal consent.
I send you my fondest love.
Adele.
My father owes me 2 months' money, May and June.
I know that part of this is being sent to me... through the British Bank of North America... but I will certainly need the full amount.
Life in Halifax is very expensive.
The small things in life... must be treated as if they were important.
I know that moral battles are fought alone.
Thousands of miles away from my family... l'm learning to look at life differently.
Now I can learn everything all by myself.
But where love is concerned, I have only him.
When I see him, I'll say to him...
"If one of us doesn't love enough... to want marriage above all... then it isn't love."
So many times he has reproached me... for the violence of my emotions... that when life brings us together again...
I'm determined to do nothing that will startle him.
I'll be able to win him over through gentleness.
Gentleness.
Good afternoon, Miss Lewly.
Your money order has arrived.
Oh, thank you.
- Here we are.
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, madam. This way to the cashier.
- Right.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Good day.
We're going home now, Mr. O'Brien.
I'd like to speak to the young lady who lives here.
Miss Lewly, yes.
-What name shall I say?
-Tell her it's her friend from Guernsey.
From Guernsey, yes.
Come in, sir, please.
Miss Lewly!
- There's someone here to see you.
- Someone to see me? Who is it?
I think it's him, the lieutenant.
I'll be right down.
Miss Lewly's coming right away.
Please go down and make yourself comfortable.
Thank you.
Will you excuse me if I go on with my work?
Please do.
- You're Lieutenant Pinson, I believe.
- Yes.
It's a long time, isn't it, since you saw Miss Lewly?
Yes, it is.
One could hardly say that your cousin's a very cheerful young lady.
But the house is much more lively since she came.
Yes, we love having her with us.
You can see at one that she's refined, well educated... and she's so pretty.
She's got such beautiful eyes.
Yes, sir, she's going to be so pleased to see you.
I'm sorry. I'll have to go. I'm on duty.
- Please wait. She won't be a moment.
- I'm sorry, I don't have time.
Albert.
At last I've found you.
Adele, you mustn't stay here.
There's nothing for you in this country.
I'll go anywhere you want, my love.
I'm ready to obey you in every way.
You know that I belong to you... that you can do with me whatever you want.
I love you so much.
Adele, I'm sure you've run away.
You're here without your family's permission, aren't you?
That's not true.
They know I'm in Halifax.
I wrote and told my father.
And what did the great man say?
Because I'm sure you left without telling him.
Am I mistaken?
I told him I was going to Malta... and I didn't write him until I got to New York.
To Malta!
Adele, you just told me you're ready to obey my every wish.
Very well.
I'm asking you to return to Guernsey.
Your family must be worried about you.
Think of your father, his reputation.
And you should not follow me.
Albert. There's a way to solve everything.
When I marry, I'll have a fortune of 40,000 francs.
I'll receive an income of 2,000 francs a year.
My family will have no right to tell me how to spend it.
And besides, I know that my father and mother... have now given their consent to our marriage.
I don't believe it.
Show me this consent.
I'll show it to you.
You don't have it, I'm sure.
Your father has always despised me.
He'll never give his consent.
Anyway, I didn't come to propose marriage... but to ask you to leave Halifax.
Look at this.
What's this mean?
I don't understand.
It's a marriage proposal to me from Canizarro.
Who is he?
He's a friend of my father's, a great Italian poet!
Well, then you'd better marry him.
But it's not him I love!
Don't you love me anymore?
Albert.
Do you love me now?
I did love you, Adele.
Tell me I can hope.
Tell me you'll love me again.
You won't answer.
Then I ask only one thing.
Even if you don't love me, let me love you.
Please, let me love you.
Take care.
If you cast me off,
I'll go to your superiors.
I'll show them your letters!
I'll do anything to harm you.
I'll tell them how you've behaved.
I'll get you thrown out of the army!
No. No, don't leave.
Here.
What's this?
To pay your gambling debts.
I'd need 10 times as much to pay my debts.
Keep it for the time being, I beg you.
I accept, but not as a gift.
As a loan.
Whatever you want, my love.
You will come back, won't you?
We'll see each other again, won't we?
If you prefer, I can meet you in town.
Whatever you want, wherever you want.
You are so handsome!
My love...
I'm so happy we've found one another again.
The worst thing in the world was your absence.
Let's never let a misunderstanding... come between us again.
Oh, I knew you couldn't forget me.
When a woman like me gives herself to a man... she is his wife.
I'm no longer crying now.
In one's life, one cannot change father, mother, or children... no more than one can change wife or husband.
I'm your wife... forever.
We'll stay together until we die.
Listen.
The poor child.
Are you there, Leopoldine?
Leopoldine, I know you're there.
If you're there, you must help me.
I've no more jealousy and no more pride.
I've gone beyond pride... but since I can't have the smile of love...
I condemn myself to its grimace.
At present, I want to think of my sisters... who sufferin bordellos... and of mysisters who sufferin marriage.
They must be given liberty and dignity... and thought for their brows and love in their hearts.
I have the religion of love.
I don't give my body without my soul... nor my soul without my body.
I'm still young... and yet it sometimes seems to me... that I've reached the autumn of my life.
Ah, Miss Lewly. But you're not wearing a coat... and in such weather.
I'll get you something hot, a nice grog.
No, thank you.
I have no time.
I've just come for some paper.
How many reams?
Uh, I need two.
Two reams, please.
This morning I was thinking
I might see you today.
Since you didn't come last week,
I said to myself... well, usually the young lady comes on Wednesday... although it's true that in weather like this... people prefer to stay home.
But still, in case you might come...
I put them aside anyway.
Thank you, Mr. Whistler.
Ah. You remember my name.
As for me, it's not difficult to remember you.
People who write as much as you are rare in Halifax.
I hope I wasn't being imprudent in preparing this for you.
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't have enough for both of them.
Just give me one.
Oh, no. Take them both.
You can pay another time.
No. I don't want to.
Yes, yes. It's my pleasure.
Thank you.
Good-bye, Mr. Whistler.
Good-bye, Miss Lewly.
Oh, what's happened?
She's fainted.
Let me give you a hand.
Coachman!
I'll go to Madam Saunders'.
She may need a doctor.
- Mr. Whistler, do come in.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Saunders.
How is Miss Lewly's health?
Well, she's better, but she's still in her room.
Oh, yes.
This is the paper she usually takes.
She must've run out by now.
- Thank you.
- Don't go. I'll tell her you're here.
- She'll be so pleased to see you.
- Ah, yes. That's fine.
Miss Adele thanks you very much for the paper... but she's too tired to see anyone.
- But she'd like--
- No, it doesn't matter.
- I was only passing and I thought--
- Thank you.
- Of course.
- Sorry to have troubled you.
- Good-bye, Mrs. Saunders.
- Good-bye, Mr. Whistler. Thank you.
My dear parents... it is a trembling engaged girl who writes you.
Mr. Pinson is resolved to marry me... but only on the condition... that he receive both your consents to the marriage.
I am practically without money, for one can't live in Halifax,... on less than 400 francs a month... and I could never stand owing money... to the people where l'm staying.
My health is excellent.
My dear parents, I send my love to you all.
Don't forget to send me news about my music album.
You've given it to the editor, haven't you?
The doctor's arrived.
It's Dr. Murdock.
Send him in. Oh, wait, Mrs. Saunders.
Could your husband mail this letter?
I'd like it to go out today.
Of course. Doctor, you can come in.
Dr. Murdock, Miss Lewly.
Good day, Miss Lewly.
Good day, Doctor.
Give me your hand, please.
How is she, Doctor?
It's a little more serious than a simple chill. A touch of pleurisy.
But only if she'll let herself be looked after--
Oh, she'll be well-looked after,
Doctor, I promise you.
Yes, but our patient seems rather headstrong.
Her recovery may be long-- uh, two, three weeks, perhaps longer.
Ah, if only spring would come.
- Could you post this letter for me?
- Of course.
I'd ask Mr. Saunders to post it, but he won't be in until late.
Who in this house can be writing letters to Victor Hugo?
Miss Lewly.
Miss Lewly?
What do you know of this young lady?
Well, she hasn't told me very much about herself... but I know she's French.
She did say her sister was drowned at the age of 19.
Drowned at 19.
That's Leopoldine.
Do you realize that your lodger... is the second daughter of Victor Hugo?
But this Victor Hugo--
Victor Hugo is the greatest living poet... like-- I don't know--
Homer, Dante, Shakespeare.
He's also a political figure who was persecuted for his ideas.
At the risk of his life... he opposed the coup de tat which overthrew the French Republic.
His two sons were imprisoned, and he had to seek refuge in Brussels.
Now he lives in Guernsey, an island between the coast of France and Britain.
She did tell me about that island.
I assure you, madam, this man is a genius.
Incredible.
I am very proud to have examined this young woman.
Do you realize, Mrs. Saunders... that your lodger is the daughter of the most famous man in the world?
- Should we tell her we know who she is?
- Oh, no, Doctor.
If Miss Adele's hiding under an assumed name... she's got a very good reason for doing so.
No, she's an honest person... incapable of doing anything wrong.
If she wants to conceal her identity, we must respect her wishes.
You're quite right.
We must keep this to ourselves.
Just a moment. I want to make a note of the address.
You never know.
"Monsieur Victor Hugo...
Hauteville House...
Guernsey...
Channel Islands."
Remember to think of me.
I tremble with love.
You cannot desert me.
I am not myself without you.
At this moment, I don't loveyou.
Our secret is hard for me to keep.
Don't be surprised if you see me in the street someday... speaking out my love for you.
Atwell!
- Yes, sir.
- Where was this coat cleaned?
- At the usual place, sir.
- Did anybody touch it?
- Not that I know of, sir.
- All right. Thank you.
"British Bank Of North America"
- Here's your mail, miss.
- Thank you.
What are you doing?
- What's your name?
- David.
Oh, David.
That's a lovely name.
- What's your name?
- Mine?
Mine is Leopoldine.
"Your mother is very ill.
Don't forget, when you write her... that she can only make out large handwriting.
I'm sending you 700 francs through the Bank of Halifax... plus both of our consents to your marriage."
I , VictorHugo, former peer of France... authorize my daughter Adele to marry.
"But hear me, Adele...
I'm telling you formally... either marry right away or return immediately."
I lied to you. My real name is Adele.
I don't understand you, Adele.
What are you doing here?
You're wearing disguises to spy on me now?
On the contrary. I dressed like this so as not to embarrass you.
Well, thanks, Adele.
Thank you.
Albert, I absolutely had to see you.
I've received the consent from my parents. Look.
So your father changed his mind.
I wouldn't have believed it.
So you see, we can be married now.
I've already told you, Adele, it's out of the question.
How you've changed, Albert.
You can't have forgotten the letters you wrote to me.
I haven't forgotten them.
In some of them, you mentioned marriage.
I could show them to those women... to all your mistresses.
Albert, you haven't forgotten?
All right, it's true.
I did consider marrying you.
I'm no longer thinking of it.
What's the harm in that?
What's the harm in that?
But, Albert, it wasn't I who pursued you.
It was you who sought me!
It was you who wanted me!
It was you who took advantage of my father's soirees... to touch my arm.
It was you who caressed me in the hallways.
I gave myself to you.
You have to keep me.
Do you hear me?
You have to keep me.
You can't be serious.
I knew women before you.
I've known women since you, and I'll know still more.
But when we're married, you can have the same freedom.
You can see all the women you want.
You see...
I saw you with that woman and her dogs.
She looks charming.
Have you told her about me?
There are times I wonder what goes on in your head.
I want so much for us to be as we were in London... in that room where I came to you in secret.
Foryou, I've trampled on everything...
I've abandoned everything.
I spurned my parents' affection.
I betrayed the man who wanted to marry me... the only man who loved me.
Listen, Adele, I won't tolerate black mail between us.
But I love you.
Is that so hard to understand?
I love you.
If you really loved me, and not in this selfish way... you wouldn't try forcing me to marry you.
If you love someone, you allow him to be free.
Adele, if you really love me... you'll leave Halifax and go back to Guernsey.
Tell me you love me.
Adele.
Please.
I'm ready to go away.
I'm prepared to never see you again... but I only ask you for just one thing... before we part forever... to say if you could still love me.
Kiss me.
My dear parents...
I have just married Lieutenant Pinson.
The ceremony took place Saturday in a church in Halifax.
I need money for my trousseau.
I must have 300 francs immediately... in addition to my allowance.
If you'd taken care of my music as I've asked you 100 times... that would bring me in some money... and I wouldn't have to behave like a beggar.
From now on, you will write my address as follows...
Madam Pinson,
33 North Street...
Halifax, Nova Scotia.
I request that you write "Madam" on all letters... clearly on the address.
I hope this good news reaches you soon in Guernsey.
What are you all doing here?
We're waiting to see Mr. Victor Hugo.
Mr. Victor Hugo isn't well and won't be along today.
Really? Oh.
"The Guernsey Press Co. Ltd."
I'd like to see the editor of the paper, please.
Here's a letter from Mr. Victor Hugo... to put an announcement in the paper, please.
Ah, so Victor Hugo's daughter married an Englishman?
Yes. Lieutenant Pinson.
Pinson, the colonel's waiting foryou.
Ah, Pinson. Listen to this.
"Married in Paris on September 17...
Mr. Albert Pinson, of the 16th English Hussars... who fought with distinction in the Crimean War... to Mademoiselle Adele Hugo... daughter of Victor Hugo... officer of the Legion of Honor... one time peer of France... and former people's representative under the republic.
Member of the Academies Francais... and knight in the order of Charles III of Spain.
Domicile in St. Peter Port,
Guernsey."
Well, Pinson, so, become the pick of us, have you?
While you're here, drilling in Halifax... your double is off in Paris... marrying Victor Hugo's daughter.
And where did you fight in the Crimean War?
In Baden-Baden or in Monte Carlo?
Colonel, I assure you, this is some kind of a joke.
It's true, I often visited the Hugo family in exile.
Miss Hugo is a highly strung young lady.
I did hear that she left her father's house... but I've no idea where she is now.
And I give you my word of honor as an officer... that I had nothing what so ever to do with this announcement.
Come to the point.
Are you married or aren't you?
No, Colonel, I am not married.
I'm prepared to believe you.
But if your behavior were beyond reproach... you would not be exposed to mishaps of this kind.
You will do me the pleasure of clearing up this misunderstanding without delay.
One more escapade, and I shall have you brought before a court-martial.
Very well.
You are dismissed.
- Good afternoon, miss.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- I have a letter for you.
- Oh.
- There you are.
- Thank you very much.
Adele, we are extremely disappointed.
You deceived us.
You're not married, and there's no hope you ever will be.
Mr. Pinson has written us.
He informs us he'll never marry you.
Your mother wanted to go to Halifax, to bring you home.
It was very difficult to dissuade her.
Such a journey could prove fatal to her.
Her health is getting worse everyday.
I'm sending you 600 francs to pay your fare back.
If you decide to come back... your brother will meet you in Liverpool.
I love you.
You have your father's heart felt love.
Adele, think of your mother.
Think of us. Come home.
My dear parents, you're right.
I wasn't able to marry Lieutenant Pinson... since he failed to keep his promises.
He wrote me many letters asking me to marry him... and I had a chest made to lock them in.
I don't agree with your idea... of having the lieutenant sued for breach of promise.
If you really want to write him... let him know... let him know how happy you would be... to accept him into the family.
And tell him that he wouldn't find a more loving wife.
I love my mother and father.
I love my brothers.
I love you all.
But no human power can make me leave Halifax... as long as the lieutenant is here.
Miss. I have a package foryou.
It's a gift.
I'd put it aside for some time... but I hesitated to give it to you.
There.
It's for me?
Yes.
Open it.
I'll wrap it up again.
I thought--
Someone said--
Someone's been telling stories, and you listened.
I will not be spied upon.
There must be another bookshop in this town.
- Lieutenant Pinson?
- Yes?
This for me?
Albert, my love...
Do you like the young woman who brought you this note?
If you do, keep her with you until morning.
You are so handsome, Albert.
You deserve to have all the women on Earth.
Please accept my gift.
It's all right. You can relax.
You can lie down again. Go to sleep again. It's all right, Miss Tillie.
Everything is all right now.
It's fine.
It's all right.
Okay--
It's all a lie. It's just a big fake.
All a big fake.
- And now, ladies and gentlemen--
- No good. Just a big fake.
- Get off the stage!
- Who are you? Come over here.
- If you're so clever, please do.
- Yes, I'll come and show you now.
Nah, it's a big act.
- Yes, come over. I'm waiting.
- It's easy. Anybody can do that.
That's easy. Cushy.
It's simple.
- Sir, you are the clever one, are you?
- Yes.
How are you? Nice to see you here.
Stay here for a moment, will you?
Madams, mademoiselles, monsieurs...
I will now take my partner,
Miss Tillie Wong... out of her state of hypnosis.
When I count three, she will be awake.
Now, one... two, three!
- It's finished now.
- Simple! Anybody can do that.
A round of applause, ladies and gentlemen, for Miss Tillie.
Thank you.
- What is your name?
- Ralph Williams, mounted police.
- Would you mind repeating this?
- Ralph Williams, mounted police!
I see. Well, since you are so well mounted, would you mind sitting down?
Make your self at home.
Relax.
I will have to put you to sleep, of course, first... since you are willing to experiment with me.
And may I take your hat off?
Now, you just relax,
Mr. Williams.
Just forget about other things.
Listen to me carefully.
Concentrate and follow every one of my orders.
You're very tired.
Very tired, Mr. Williams, very tired.
Your hands, your arms... are very heavy.
Your legs are heavy like lead.
Within a few moments you're going to fall into deep sleep.
Now, at "one," your eyes are falling down heavily.
At "two," your eyes are closed.
At "three," you are fast asleep,
Mr. Williams.
Madams, mademoiselles, monsieurs...
It's a beautiful day.
Mr. Williams is rowing on a beautiful lake.
It's very hot, and he's rowing.
Hard, Mr. Williams!
Hard! More!
You've got a long way to go. Hasn't he?
Very hot today, Mr. Williams.
It's very hot.
You can unbutton your coat,
Mr. Williams.
Now, you're rowing very hard.
Harder!
And harder and harder.
Now you can even undo your trousers, Mr. Williams.
Madams, mademoiselles, monsieurs... if I wanted to, I could force this man to leave the police... and finish his life in a monastery.
But we are not going to go that far.
That's enough.
Enough, Mr. Williams.
Madams, mademoiselles, monsieurs... when I count "two"...
Mr. Williams is going to get up, wake and go away.
Now, then-- one, two.
Stop, Mr. Williams!
Your clothes!
Your clothes.
Yes, Mr. Williams, here you are.
There you are.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Sir, may I come in?
Please do.
I was in the theater.
I just saw the show.
It was remarkable.
I was very impressed.
But I'm not here just to tell you that.
I would like to propose a business offer.
Oh? Business?
You have a theater?
No.
That's not what I meant.
I'm listening.
Well?
You're not saying anything.
I am very intrigued by your power.
You are very kind.
I am only doing my work.
I am just an instrument of a force... coming from elsewhere.
Does this power have any limits?
Oh, yes.
Space, for example.
I cannot act on subjects outside of my presence.
But tell me. Are you a journalist?
No. I'd like to employ your talents for a personal matter.
- To cure someone sick?
- No.
I've done it before, you know.
No. It's not for that.
Could you change someone's feelings?
What do you mean?
I mean... for example, change love to hate... or vice versa?
No, I'm sorry.
I-- No, I can't.
I can only work on the bodies, not the souls.
All I can do with hypnosis... is to force certain people to act against their will... and I do mean certain people only.
Occasionally, there are subjects who do not respond.
Listen, sir, could you compel a man to marry a woman?
- Against his will?
- Yes.
Oh, yes. Why not?
Provided one can lure him to a certain prearranged place.
And then one would need... all that's necessary for the ceremony-- a minister, of course... and then two witnesses.
Well, on careful consideration... it's not easy... but it's not impossible.
It's only a matter of money.
I have money.
Tillie. Come on out.
Hurry. Come on.
Come on. Hurry.
- So you have money?
- My father has.
- Where is your father?
- In Europe. He's a rich and famous man.
In Europe?
Then I can write him, and he'll send me the money?
No. I don't want his name mixed up in this.
Listen, my dear, it will never work out.
It's much too serious a matter for me to rush blindly into.
Besides, why should I trust you?
Who is your father?
Either you are completely unrelated to the man you claim to be your father... and you'll never succeed in getting enough money-- for I should need a great deal-- or else you are really his daughter... in which case, I cannot afford the risk.
So you're saying you refuse?
I refuse.
I won't do it... unless--
Listen.
I'll need 5,000 francs... in advance.
I'll have the money in a week.
Fine. Well, can we--
Excuse me, guv. Where'd you want this uniform? Over there?
Madam-- Look what you've done, you stupid idiot. Get out of here!
- You ignorant--
- Ow! Ow!
Get out!
Go on, get out!
I denounce the lying of legal status... the swindle of identity.
Born of father unknown...
Born of father unknown.
I was born... of father unknown... of a father completely unknown.
But I don't know my father... if I was born of unknown father.
Ayoung married couple is buried in the same coffin.
Not even death can separate them.
The dress of the young dead woman... is displayed in her parents' home.
But it's mine, too.
It's my home.
The dress of the young bride... is displayed like a relic for all visitors.
And what about me?
What am I to do?
Oh, my eyes are aching.
My eyes.
I can't look at them any longer.
I can't stand to see that trunk of clothes any longer.
My sister's clothes will have to be thrown away!
They'll have to be burnt... or given away!
I can't stand the sight of those dresses!
Oh, my eyes can't stand them!
Oh, my eyes!
Miss Adele!
Let me in! What's the matter?
How can he do this?
He can't do this!
Johnstone.
Agnes Johnstone.
O'Brien, do you know Mount Emiliamena?
- Yes, Miss Lewly.
- Take me to it. I want to go there.
But I'll have to turn 'round.
It's the other side of town.
Whoa.
Wait. Wait for me.
- Yes, mademoiselle?
- I should like to see Judge Johnstone.
- I must see the judge.
- You cannot come in here, miss.
- Yes, I can!
- You must have an appointment!
Who is it, George?
It's all right, Miss Agnes.
There's a young lady who wishes to see the judge, but she has no appointment.
Don't make such a fuss. I'll go to my father. I'm sure he'll see her.
I must see him.
I must see him.
Absolutely.
My father will see you now.
Thank you for agreeing to see me when you don't know who I am.
You're French, it would seem.
Yes. I'm the daughter of Victor Hugo.
The author. I do not share his political ideas... but I admire his courage.
Sir, I'll come right to the point.
I've just read ofyour daughter's engagement... and I have to tell you that Lieutenant Pinson... is absolutely unworthy of becoming part of your family.
I don't know, Miss, if you appreciate... the seriousness of what you're saying.
I am perfectly aware of it.
I have known Lieutenant Pinson for some years.
He was cunning enough to insinuate himself... into the good graces of my family.
He courted me, discreetly but persistently... and I must admit that I responded to him.
I had little experience of the world... for two years of exile had kept me from it.
This young man knew how to charm a naive young girl... and I was indeed naive.
I was so naive that
I broke off my engagement... with Mr. Auguste Vacquerie, a friend of my father.
I had only one thought: that of marrying Lieutenant Pinson.
But your parents?
My parents were strongly opposed to this marriage.
My mother, who suspected I was meeting Lieutenant Pinson... in secret, found out about him.
He never was the son of a clergyman.
He was imprisoned for his debts.
As he couldn't pay them... he was given the choice between prison and the army.
He chose the army.
But because of my determination... my parents gave their consent, and our marriage took place.
Lieutenant Pinson even signed the contract.
Have you any proof?
Of course. Here.
Here are some clippings from the Guernsey newspaper... announcing our engagement and marriage.
If this lieutenant is as bad as you say he is... how can you still be his wife?
Do you think people can always control their feelings?
One can be in love with a man... and still despise everything about him.
And besides...
I'm expecting his child.
You're ridiculous.
Left wail!
- Evening, George.
- Miss Agnes is not at home, sir.
- But she's expecting me.
- Miss Agnes is not at home.
- Then I'll have a word with the judge.
- The judge is not at home, sir.
But his carriage is in the drive.
I'm very sorry, sir.
There's no one at home.
I intend to have that woman deported.
To hell with the scandal.
Come now, Lieutenant.
Calm down. There is a way.
- Have I ever given you bad advice?
- All right, I'm listening.
If I've got it right, all this woman has to do is leave Halifax...
- and your troubles are over.
- But how do I get her to go?
I've tried everything-- threats, prayers, promises.
I've even begged her.
Nothing works.
She follows you like a dog.
She won't leave Halifax until the day you do.
That's a lot of help.
Thank you very much... since there's no question of me leaving.
Well, sir, I've heard differently.
There's a rumor going around... that the regiment might be sent away very soon.
We're going to miss you... but I'm happy you've made the right decision.
And your parents will be so happy... to see you again after all this time.
I hope that...
May I speak of Lieutenant Pinson?
I hope you've put him right out of your mind.
He's not worthy ofyou.
Who does he think he is... refusing to marry you?
You're mistaken,
Mrs. Saunders.
I'm the one who didn't want to get married.
I think marriage is degrading for a woman... especially for a woman like me.
My work requires solitude.
And think about my name,
Mrs. Saunders.
Think about my father.
I could never give up the name of Miss Hugo.
Yes. Yes. I understand.
This incredible thing... that a young girl... whose only bread today... depends on herfather's good charity... still suffering from hatred after 4 years... this thing I willdo.
This incredible thing, that a young girl... should step over the ocean, pass from the old world to the new... and join her lover-- this thing I will accomplish.
Miss Adele, I have a present foryou.
It's a cape.
It's too pretty for me.
It'll look so much lovelier on you.
You'll keep it in memory of us.
Thank you, Mrs. Saunders.
Thank you so much.
Au revoir, Miss Adele.
Write to me when you get home.
Where to, miss?
I don't know.
I don't know anymore.
Why don't you stay with Mrs. Saunders a few more days?
I can't.
I don't want to see her again.
Shall we go to the hotel?
I have no money left.
Well, I do know a place where you wouldn't have to pay.
Don't touch that.
It's my book.
Please-- Please, do you have my mail?
- I don't know who you are.
- But I always get my mail here.
I'll go and find out.
No.
I am sorry, miss, but these people are new here. They don't know who you are.
I'll just see if there's a letter foryou.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Adele, here are 700 francs for your return passage.
If you persist on staying in Halifax,...
I will regard this money as an advance on your pension.
You complain of my slowness in getting your music published.
For the present, it would be better... for you to avoid attracting attention to yourself.
Your mother is so ill that we keep your letters from her... in order not to aggravate her condition.
She has left Guernsey and settled in Brussels... so I am staying alone in Hauteville House.
Adele, my dear one... my arms are opened to you.
I am old.
My greatest joy... would be to have all of you by my side.
"Morning Herald"
"Brussels.
We have learned of the death of Mrs. Victor Hugo...
"wife of the famous French poet."
"We here by announce that the 16th Hussars... stationed in Halifax... will be moving on February 15, 1864... to the Barbados Islands."
Move aside.
Leave the French lady alone.
Excuse me, Mrs. Pinson.
I have to have a word with the captain.
Of course.
There's something you ought to know.
I was in the Negro Quarter this morning... and at the market place I saw a European woman who was causing quite a scene.
I got nearer, and it was her-- Miss Hugo.
-What?
-Yes, and I've got worse news than that.
She's going by the name of "Mrs. Pinson."
We have to find her.
What happened in Halifax mustn't happen here.
What did he want?
Oh, it's nothing, really.
It's nothing.
I'll read the letter for you.
I've changed it a little.
You can tell me if it's all right.
"Sir, I am only a simple woman from the Barbados Islands.
I don't know how to read, but
I know the name of Victor Hugo.
Ten years ago, I was still a slave... and I know that you are the friend and defender... of the oppressed on Earth.
I had noticed in the streets of Bridgetown... a woman dressed like no one else... who seemed to be poor and marked by destiny.
Children made fun of her in the streets... and this distressed me.
One day, I felt obliged to protect her.
I brought her to my house and took care of her.
I have learned that she is your daughter... that she was abandoned by an officer... whom she followed to Halifax and then here, to Barbados.
Sorrow has broken her, body and soul.
If her body is now healed, her soul is perhaps lost.
Adele needs to return home to the warmth of her family.
I could, if you agree,
Mr. Victor Hugo... bring your daughter back to Europe.
Mr. Werder, of Martinique... will advance me the money for the journey."
And so Adele returned to France, accompanied by Madam Baa.
Major changes had taken place in Europe.
The fall of Napoleon III... had permitted the return of Victor Hugo... who went home to France after 18 years of exile.
Reunited with his daughter Adele... he had to place her in a private clinic in Saint-Mande... where she lived for 40 years.
There, she enjoyed gardening, played the piano... and continued to write her journal... in her own secret language.
Adele outlived all her family.
Her father died on May 22, 1885.
His last words were,
"I see a black light. "
The day of Victor Hugo's funeral... was a day of mourning for all of France.
Victor Hugo's body lay in state all night... under the Arch of Triumph.
And the next day, two million Parisians... followed his coffin from the Place de l'Etoile... to the Pantheon.
The death of his daughter Adele on April 25, 1915... passed almost unnoticed... in the turmoil of the First World War.
Fifty years earlier, as she was about to leave Guernsey...
Adele had written in her journal...
"This incredible thing, that a young girl... should step over the ocean... leave the old world for the new world... to join her lover-- this thing will I accomplish."
"This was the story of Adele H."
"This was the story of Adele H."
Colbert !
What a joy to see you!
You too, d'Artagnan.
Time is short.
My castle is nearby.
Your message did not arrive yesterday.
Can not you receive with great pomp.
My visit do it remain secret.
D'Artagnan?
Who accompanies it?
I do not recognize.
Regardless, there is only one.
It is large enough.
Tenezvous ready with the coach.
I could not miss this opportunity, despite the risk.
You will find your people before the sun is at its zenith.
Dismoi, D'Artagnan, how is the boy?

Here is our godson, Philip.
Mr. Colbert, an old friend.
Aramis, Porthos...
Very honored.
Go tell our lovely Marianne that we starve.
Embrassela And on my part.
Marianne takes care of the castle.
She was the nurse of Philip on his arrival here.
How trouvezvous?
Extraordinary.
Absolutely amazing.
Ten men.
With me to the stables.
Follow the captain.
Can I help you?
For once you're there!
On behalf of D'Artagnan.
He returned with a friend.
I know, everything is ready.
Dismoi, Marianne,
Colbert is this?
Negotiations with Spain led
Absolutely.
I'm agree with me.
It only remains to persuade King a marriage for the salvation of France do it pass before his preferences somewhat eccentric.
Good luck!
Baron?
The breakfast, at last!
How does  "last"?
It was indeed ready.
Hello,
M. Colbert.
I believe in the virtue of persuasive dowry of the Infanta.
Spanish doubloons 600000 will do a better lawyer than I with Louis.
Its coffers are empty.
Louis accept this marriage, even reluctantly.
And I will put an end to these futile wars with Spain.
Troubles arrive.
We do not see you do it.
Retenezles!
Gentlemen, you disappoint me.
I hoped cross swords with you before your surrender.
Emmenezles!
The swords!
Out of my wine!
Horses!
The stairs!
The river is there.
Your people are on the other side.
You will be safe.
Sergeant !
Drop your swords.
Qu'attendiezvous?
Drop your swords.
Do not obey! Not for me!
The others too.
Emmenezle to the coach.
I wonder how this will , Labas.
Your Highness looking forward to it?
Not for the country, for the man.
Hard to get an idea with a picture as old.
Savezvous what I think?
What you have any hidden recent portrait.
Your Highness, why would I do?
To hide what he became.
I can assure you that
Louis of France is a handsome man and very dignified.
This is a cynical and dissolute with many mistresses.
It is also said he is hated by all the French.
Who  tenezvous these lies?
I have to marry the king unknown to me.
But if I can not love, know that policy or not, the marriage will happen.
Ecartezvous! Make way!
Lower the grill!
Is it ready?
Amenezle.
Gardezles!
Here!
Too late!
Twenty years too late...
Be found.
Commander?
Here, Captain.
The man in the coach do it wear this.
No one do it to see it.
Courage, my boy.
Amenezle inside.
Where emmenezvous me?
Remove the escort.
Online.
Hurry.
Quick!
You will soon return.
Lâchezmoi!
Attachezle.
What have I done?
Diteslemoi.
Emmenezles  and wait outside.
Do you want your freedom, right?
What Voulezvous me?
Who ordered that?
These figures, corrected by me, are to show the king.
The original do-it being turned.
It's done.
And those who saw it?
All dead.
Dear Captain, there is only one person, except  MySelf, who knows face that hides the iron mask...
You.
Milord?
I know I can count on your silence , Captain.
Rassurezvous, you have no fear of having
Come back before dusk.
I will have the title your domain.
You are now owner.
This is it, the La Valliere!
The king's whore!
You and your beautiful coach!
It helps to be the king's mistress!
Take the fucking!
Here is your king, whore!
Regains your lair, dirty whore!
That's how you end up!
Madam, I would appreciate prevent his Majesty that I expect to maintain of a material fact.
So, Mr. Colbert, ditesmoi what is going on and I will inform His Majesty.
You are too good.
But it is vital that I speak to Her Majesty himself.
I do not doubt it.
I let him know.
Her Majesty will be pleased to know you expect.
How is
His Majesty today?
Do I need to fetch the doctor?
The Crown- need of such bleeding?
Her Majesty  right.
What good blood, if not that of others?
I forgot...
Expected Colbert to talk
Spanish reached this you going to marry.
I know you must do.
But no question that you have.
She can love you like me.
This is impossible.
I am the only woman you truly love.
It works!
What?
Give a number and I do.
Fascinating...
Of the six, four, no matter!
Try six.
Go, my pretty, be good.
There is a trick!
Point of thing.
Question fingering and training.
Montremoi those dice.
I think our friends Labas take the bait.
Want to see ?
Do you?
Approchezvous grid, that everyone sees.
It takes the dice like that.
Interesting.
It is desired numbers under these two fingers.
How about it?
Oublieles and montrenous.
We always need money!
The secret is in the launch.
As this... September
I want to try.
No, me!
No, me first!
Willingly.
Perfect.
Beautiful demonstration.
Go back to your cell and comportezvous in sentient beings, grandparents in adults.
Move!
Another, Your Majesty.
Now you can steal with impunity , thanks to the royal seal.
Do not bafouillez, Fouquet,
I'm not an idiot.
You're not more.
Furthermore, the state of my finances forbids me to pay you.
I can assure you...
Stop playing the innocent.
After all, it is the Treasury you fly,
I do not.
Avisezvous to touch my money to Spanish and your head will top a picnic!
My love!
Have a drink.
You certainly need and what a wonderful remedy you...
Take care,
I can undo it.
I would again appeal to your remedies.
Colbert has arranged everything for tomorrow?
Any, Your Majesty.
I have all the details.
It will kill me tomorrow, my love
In view of all Paris.
Whatever, I'm not even there.
You said...
I'll explain.
You know, attempts were made to raise the population against me.
I'll show them what is the terrible power one of which was invested by heaven itself!
The idea comes from him.
Diteslui.
I learned that a young Gascon looked so amazing to the king.
It will take the place of His Majesty for the arrival of the Infanta.
The idea do it please you.
And then, it will killed by enemies of the crown.
Carefully selected...
Accepteraitil Why?
To wellbeing.
And the salvation of his dearest friends.
An hour later, I réapparaîtrai, free!
The king is dead! Long live the king!
Proof  divinity of the king.
No more hand will dare to come to challenge you.
You will become a living legend.
These dogs do not like me, but after this, they fear me.
Go, young man.
Standing.
Your test is completed.
More than a few minutes.
Go now.
I'll see you at Fontainebleau in an hour.
Do not see, my darling.
Hâtezvous.
Ditesmoi, estce the custom in your country lost to sit in the presence of his king?
He does not believe me.
Diteslui, Fouquet.
You are in the presence of Her Majesty
Louis king of France and Navarre.
Standing peasant.
You've been talking about me.
You come from far tone but you talk about me?
Certainly.
Who does not know
Louis, King of France?
That's much better.
The coat, he tries.
We will be able to satisfy your curiosity.
"We"?
Fouquet, for once
I use the royal "we" without feeling ridiculous.
We, my good friend...
We will do a two, for a day.
This should be enough.
Continue, Fouquet, it's up to you to explain, not mine
You are here to complete a secret task.
Tomorrow, you will replace the king.
If you obey the letter, you will be rewarded
And the Musketeers will be released.
Otherwise...
Check , forward.
Go, scum!
Let us hear you! Stronger!
You can get away!
We are alone.
Damned bells!
Their sound has always driven him mad.
Louis, my love, saurezvous how it's over?
Keeping at least a look at Paris.
The voyezvous?
Your Majesty!
Your hand, idiot.
Go ahead.
Your Majesty, let few words of welcome?
Your Majesty looks surprised.
I did not expect to see you here, Mr. Colbert.
Philip!
Did not you know?
I swear.
The Musketeers?
Embastillés.
I did not know all that.
You are perhaps in danger.
Caution.
Everything at the convenience of Her Majesty?
Everything is perfect.
It looks better than expected.
Company!
What happened?
You have nothing?
Do you have seen the king?
Here is the king!
The King!
The King is safe!
Stand back!
Louis, look!
It's done!
The king is safe.
His coach!
The Musketeers!
Use your power.
My faithful friends!
My faithful friends!
Thank God and yourself
For the reception of the queen.

And  again become free men!
God bless you all!
You are more accustomed me in this.
I am apologize for what happened.
I am so happy that Her Majesty be saved!
Who were these men?
These men?
God only knows.
I must admit that your majesty surprises me.
I had your portrait but it does not show everything.
Certainly not.
I have also said things...
What are they?
Who does not match what I see.
You are very diplomatic.
It makes you angry?
Please to believe...
It is not a question of pleasing me.
My only hope is that your life here you like.
It pleases me, I'm sure.
Check , faster!
To celebrate my immortality: fireworks and solemn procession!
What it's fun!
Why this decision?
It's Fouquet.
Your Majesty.
Check, turn around.
Qu'estce to say, Fouquet?
It is alive.
It is alive.
You almost! idiot!
How did you have?
D'Artagnan!
Quick, the deception can not last.
It is the palace.
Porthos behind.
Must convince him to leave.
Glorious, no?
Yes, but do not forget your friends they're waiting in a carriage.
D'Artagnan?
Together again, Fouquet.
It was a long time.
Been Aramis
Athos and .
Porthos, of course.
You have a priceless object.
It'll please you, Porthos.
Gentlemen, you are free to go.
You all.
Take the impostor and you will live.
We will do it ourselves.
He comes.
Let's go! Hurry!
Pardonnezmoi but Her Majesty looks worried.
What Estil?
I have to leave. I'm sorry.
Please.
I have to.
Promettezmoi back to me quickly.
I promise.
I will return.
Fouquet?
Etesvous there, Fouquet?
My dear Fouquet you are looking for.
I thought you were talking with the king.
Yes, of course.
Where Estil?
The King?
No one knows where to find it.
I mean
D'Artagnan and his friends.
The Musketeers ?
They were here?
Do not play at the end with me, Colbert.
They will pay with their lives.
I apologize.
I must find my king.
Wait outside, please.
Sister Anne, you are summoned to Paris.
You are cleared until you return your vow of silence.
God be with you.
Bernard
What joy to see you!
Do you have slept well?
We slept.
There is not much better than staying here the Bastille.
Porthos, you may to be drunk by noon and owe me a fortune tonight.
How do you know it was me?
You stay long?
The time that things pack down a bit.
You are involved all , or your young friend only?
Estce Who?
Do not you know your king when you did before you?
Included.
"Mind your own business,
Bernard."
Only one man knows where we are.
He will present himself as Mr. William
You'll do it down.
If someone else had?
Jettele down!
Will this make me wait long
HRH wants to show you its best.
To Me? Or that boor who she was before?
Victoria tell Mr. Colbert
I see Her Majesty soon as I get dressed.
If your head is always on your shoulders, it is because only you can find it.
But your time is limited!
My men everywhere want.
Your Majesty...
His Royal Highness the Infanta of Spain.
Madam, thank you for coming.
Your Majesty.
Please be seated.
Your Majesty has recovered of yesterday's events?
Thank you.
We handed.
We'll discuss this later.
I have sent for you, indeed to see you again, but for this document mere formality requiring your signature.
Fouquet, have the kindness...
I can assure you that everything is in order.
Pardonnezmoi, but I do not understand your language.
I beg your pardon.
I asked if he agreed to sign before marriage
And not after, as is customary.
Before, after...
How important, for two days!
You will not refuse!
I see no reason to hurry unnecessarily.
Vain!
Is is perhaps not that there a protocol problem.
Is it not, Fouquet?
Perhaps, Your Majesty...
"Perhaps"
It looks like two parrots!
It shall be as you please.
We will write a new agreement, after the ceremony.
Thank you, ma'am, for coming.
Your Majesty, it would be better...
That's going to take care of this witch!
We can not afford a diplomatic incident.
What did the other moron yesterday?
You think he could confide?
It is never sure of anything.
It is never sure of anything.
Estil Who?
My love.
Thank you God, you are there!
Unable All these will make me mad.
Everything had to be so simple.
It should be dead.
My poor Louis.
Répondezmoi!
Your Majesty,
I took the liberty to call someone who can answer you better than me.
If your Majesty would follow me...
Okay, Fouquet.
Come listen to your informant.
Pray that he told the truth.
Aramis...
Who am I?
You?
Your Majesty.
Mother!
It is my brother?
This is the truth, Philip.
We were there when D'Artagnan brought you.
Your father immediately saw the danger.
Twins... Twins heirs to the throne of France.
Inconceivable.
We have fomented civil wars for less than that.
Why me?
Why this is I that my father chose?
He had no choice.
It took one of two babies, closest to him and he told us.
Nobody knows where was born first?
Person.
That is impossible!
Colbert and the Musketeers had the confidence of your father.
I am not aware for two years.
And he is still alive?
It is your brother!
Do him no harm.
Savezvous  invisible bonds that connect twins?
By attacking him you would put in grave danger.
I will not ask you your word, because you do not feel required to comply.
Souvenezvous of my warning.
These are the last words you hear me.
"No choice", D'Artagnan.
Your own words.
And my brother was crowned.
For all we know, I could well be the first born.
You want him to take his crown?
Would I do a worse king him?
Much better.
You had a much better king.
Be careful what you say.
From treason.
Exact. It's ugly to betray.
It's not for us.
Too risky.
Beware  great disappointments, my liege.
They are right, my boy.
Forget it.
Think of the campaign, open spaces, trees...
And Marietherese?
What will til her?
I have one!
Wonderful, my dear I need you ll match.
True that Her Majesty may be moody.
It is sometimes a good mood.
Your Highness has ellemême experienced.
Mr. Colbert,
I discovered that you were good.
While for you it is a marriage political arrangement.
Croyezmoi, I caress the hope it more than that.
Thank you, Colbert.
I hope so too.
Hunters!
These are the king's horses.
Yes, I think.
Let's surprise him.
We may disturb the hunt.
Pensezvous! The king has fun, it may be in a good mood.
I would like that, Colbert.
Here it is.
I take it, madam.
My dear, great you are.
Not satisfied with being the best, you hunt better than any man.
My God, that I hunt fautil far?
You abuse your privileges to our yard.
Privileges, Your Majesty?
The Infanta did not need to move as it wishes.
We are sorry to have disturbed your hunt!
Do not move.
And it will not attack you.
Expliquezlui, it ignores he's dealing with His Highness.
Reconduisezla away from his apartment.
See you later, ma'am.
As for you, Colbert you did was of no help this afternoon.
The hunt continues.
Never for anything,
I marry this man.
Go and never come back here.
Abroad, what business brings you here?
Bernard?
Who asks?
I am Mr. William.
You come to your friends.
Hurry, they go soon.
Colbert, come with us.
We save.
Where is Philip?
Here!
We have the art of disguise.
Do not forget that
Porthos has emptied the barrel.
Others also fled.
The Infanta left Paris.
I have done anything.
Qu'estil happened?
The inevitable...  Louis arrived, this whore
La Valliere arrived.
If Marietherese arrives in Spain, it means war and the end of all my work.
Here, for you my friend.
Thank you.
Very kind of you.
Wine, guys! Good wine!
Buvonsle the square.
No, take this street.
Not to worry.
These morons do not know what they are looking
The Princess do not do it out of France.
What to do?
When the king learns his departure...
Ll send the troops.
We must find her before.
How?
We will get there.
But how?
I know where to find it.
We need horses!
We are proud of them.
"Chantel", a great hunter. And. ..
My fiery steed.
Regardezle closer.
You are nervous.
Rightly.
I am the ambassador of the King of Spain, protected by the crown...
For nothing.
Where Estelle?
Where Estelle?
I beg you!
I know!
There is one hour.
The southern route.
Labas!
Haltelà!
Êtesvous Who? This is an outrage!
Do not worry, Your Highness.
Ecoutezmoi.
How osezvous?
You are in danger! Come!
Soldiers!
Turn off the lantern!
Convainquezla.
We will retain.
Turn off that.
Ecoutezmoi!
Time is running out!
I must take you!
No.
It must!
We'll talk later.
Let them go.
Consider the woods!
They dismount!
It is not there!
We are pursuing?
We have retained enough.
What is being done?
The ladies...
We can not abandon them.
The ladies!
Course, Aramis.
I was raised in Gascony by D'Artagnan.
I always thought that my father had died at Sens.
I did in Paris was my double, the King of France.
I swear,
Louis and I are twins.
I have learned that this morning.
Qu'allonsnous do?
Something...
Magic.
Watch your step.
Okay?
Where ironsnous tomorrow?
Your eyes are green.
We know so little from each other.
D'Artagnan must be prevented.
What?
What is the brother of King you want to marry.
Bernard, listen!
Who is it?
Be careful.
Who goes there?
Calm, Bernard.
No one knows we're here.
I thought...
Do not be silly.
Come.
Do not go away.
It's late.
We must leave.
Rest.
Stay here.
Nobody knows we're here.
I beg you.
Quick, go!
This time, you do not escape.
Why keep him alive?
It is my brother.
Then, he will die soon by choking with her own hair.
I do not have to be there for nothing.
Nothing.
I wish I knew already dead.
Surprised, Colbert?
You have stopped it?
Stopped?
Not quite, but it will be hard to again elude us.
N'êtesvous not relieved?
I saved your own diplomacy.
As the dot  Spanish course.
Of course, double benefit...
What more?
Pardonnezmoi, I have to do.
You will stay here.
Your Highness, can I help you?
Ecartezvous of my way.
Can we ask you # where you go?
We can.
The king does not want to see you.
You take in very comfortably for someone so ordinary.
The king grants me the privilege.
Do not forget,
Your Highness .
I want to see the Spanish ambassador.
It is unfortunately impossible.
How you permettezvous...
HE succumbed to an accident.
A fall from a horse.
Tragic.
Hard to believe it.
The ambassador did not come up.
The horses terrified him.
This explains it.
Yes, he was murdered.
Guards!
Escort to His Highness apartments.
She is suffering.
If necessary, please to let me know.
Exit.
Obéissezmoi.
Get out!
You were clumsy,
Your Highness.
You are no longer in Spain.
While you have a very high opinion of vousmême,
Do not forget
Tomorrow I'll be the queen of France, not you.
Do you believe that this will change anything?
You are very young, very pretty, but very naive.
And you, madam, with all these years and more,
're crazy enough to believe that
I will have no influence.
Your influence is checked by seeing if your boorish lover wither to death in the Bastille or, tortured, begging that he the ends.
This thought seems to give you some amazement.
Why?
Strange passion...
Pardonnezmoi.
I will do my best passion for such a dead letter.
What a joy to know you saved.
I'd rather be at large. ordered to accompany His Highness to his apartments.
In this case, we must obey.
Allow me to accompany you.
I must confess that one of charms your company lies in being able practice your native language.
Souvenezvous, at the court of your father,
I had some skill in this area.
Have you seen anyone go?
I am blind.
We can not let this happen and consider themselves the Musketeers.
Well, what?
Marietherese suggested me an idea, but...
Frankly...
Always tell.
It draws the last sentence of Philip and depends on the ability of
Marietherese to do able to do what she says.
I hesitate .
Do not forget it is a remarkable woman.
Everything will be ready for the return of His Majesty tomorrow.
So be it.
I'm getting married, of course, but no way to miss one day hunting for it.
Estce Who?
My love?
Where êtesvous?
I thought you were at Fontainebleau.
I was...
Êtesvous How come?
I walked.
Etesvous only?
My guards?
They are mailed but did not notice anything.
Majesty, I beg you, accordezmoi a moment.
Croyezmoi, my wish is not to displease you.
I've got a present.
A family heirloom.
With us, they say than that will take him to his wedding
See all his wishes fulfilled.
It is exquisite.
There is no more beautiful in Europe.
I will wear it.
Your Majesty's gracious.
I've delayed that too.
Excuse me.
No, wait!
Only...
What do you extraordinary woman.
Yesterday.
Yes, yesterday!
Yesterday I saw the picture of my king.
You have escaped!
Not you.
I was afraid not to answer your desires.
In my desires?
No message, ma'am.
Should I send someone the palace?
The king will not be long.
Bring champagne.
I want to be your wife and meet the requirements of your Majesty.
My brother?
What ressentezvous for him?
None.
Nothing at all.
It has yet  you made love.
I thought it was you.
How could I guess?
Réalisezvous that you are aware of a great secret and it is worth more than the life of every man or woman?
It's all for the Queen of France.
And his life?
What donneriezvous to save?
I marchanderais life of a man who humiliated me
Come.
Closer look this "loyalty".
Harlot!
Do stop that noise!
Stop!
What a-til, madam?

We both rendezvous at the Bastille.
Hurry !
Come.
What jouonsnous?
Do not be shy.
We have all our time,
Majesty.
Any time can imagine.
Please be patient.
I will make you happy.
Let's drink to love.
This is an affront.
Just a few questions as celleci: did you saw that this afternoon?
Speak, do not force us to test yourselves.
Hâtezvous!
Laissezmoi cover you.
It is Lahaut.
Hurry!
From beautiful work, dear.
A we take over.

Look at the trouble we take to avoid any inconvenience.
Then we go to practice.

Why not?
The king told us the Bastille useless to argue.
Keys...
Not so fast!
Porthos like to go your past kindness.
Mettonsle here.
Never  not be found.
Colbert?
Aramis.
Did you find it?

And the man in the mask?
Fouquet!
Where is the king?

My mind is clearer now
At last, all too well
I can see
Where we all soon will be
If you strip away
The myth from the man
You will see
Where we all soon will be
Jesus
You've started to believe the things they say of you
You really do believe this talk of God is true
And all the good you've done will soon get swept away
You've begun to matter more
Than the things you say
Listen, Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right-hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong
I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then
We called you a man
And believe me
My admiration for you hasn't died
But every word you say today
Gets twisted 'round some other way
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied
Nazareth, your famous son should have stayed a great unknown
Like his father carving wood he'd have made good
Tables, chairs and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best
He'd have caused nobody harm
No one alarm
Listen, Jesus
Do you care for your race
Don't you see we must keep in our place
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far
If we go
Too far
Listen, Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
But it's sad to see our chances
Weakening with every hour
Your followers are blind
Too much heaven on their minds
It was beautiful but now it's sour
Yes, it's all
Gone sour
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Listen, Jesus to the warning I give
Please remember that I want us to live
So come on, come on
He won't listen to me
Ah, Ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh
Come on, listen
Listen to me
Come on and listen to me
Ah, Ahh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Come on
Listen to me
Come on, listen
Listen to me
Ah-ah-ahh
Ohh, oh-oh-ohh
Come on
Listen to me
Listen to me

- When do we ride to Jerusalem
When do we ride to Jerusalem
When do we ride to Jerusalem
When do we ride to Jerusalem
When do we ride to Jerusalem
Why should you want to know
Why are you obsessed with fighting
Times and fates you can't defy lf you knew the path we're riding
You'd understand it less than I
What's the buzz
Tell me what's a-happenin'

It seems to me a strange thing
Mystifying
That a man like you can waste his time
On women of her kind
Hey, cool it, man.
[ Chuckling ]
Yes, I can understand that
She amuses
But to let her kiss you and stroke your hair
That's hardly in your line
It's not that I object to her profession
But she doesn't fit in well with what you teach and say
It doesn't help us if you're inconsistent
They only need a small excuse
To put us all away
Who are you to criticize her
Who are you to despise her
Leave her, Leave her
Let her be now
Leave her, Leave her
She's with me now lf your slate is clean then you can throw stones lf your slate is not then leave her alone
- Hey, Jesus, what do we say ?
- [ Disciples Chattering ]
[ Chattering, lndistinct ]
I'm amazed that men like you
Can be so shallow thick and slow
There is not a man among you who knows or cares if I come or go
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong
No, you're wrong
You're very wrong
How can you say that
How can you say that
How can you say that
How can you say that
Not one.
Not one of you !
We've been sitting on the fence for far too long
Why let him upset us
Caiaphas, let him be
All those imbeciles will see
He really doesn't matter
Jesus is important
We've let him go his way before
And while he starts a major war
We theorize and chatter
He's just another
Scripture-thumping hack from Galilee
The difference is they call him King
The difference frightens me
What about the Romans ?
When they see
King Jesus crowned
Do you think they'll stand around
Cheering and applauding
What about our people
If they see we've lost our nerve
Don't you think that they deserve
Something more rewarding
They've got what they want
They think so anyway
If he's what they want
Why take their toy away
He's a craze
Put yourself in my place
I can hardly step aside
Cannot let my hands be tied
I am law and order
What about our priesthood
Don't you see that we could fall
If we are to last at all
We cannot be divided
Then say so to the Council
But don't rely on subtlety
Frighten them or they won't see
Then we are decided
Then we are decided.
Try not to get worried
Try not to turn onto
Problems that upset you
Don't you know everything's all right
Yes, everything's fine
And we want you to sleep well tonight
Let the world turn without you tonight
If we try, we'll get by so forget all about us
- Tonight
- Everything's all right, yes
Everything's all right, yes
Sleep and I shall soothe you calm you and anoint you
- Myrrh for your hot forehead
- Ah
Then you'll feel everything's all right
Yes, everything's fine
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
And relax
Think of nothing
- Tonight
- Everything's all right, yes
- Everything's all right, yes
- Hey, hey, woman
Your fine ointment brand-new and expensive
Should have been saved for the poor
Why has it been wasted
We could have raised maybe
Three hundred silver pieces or more
People who are hungry
People who are starving
They matter more than your
Feet and hair
Try not to get worried
Try not to turn onto
- Problems that upset you
- Oh
- Don't you know everything's all right
- All right, yes
- Everything's all right, yes
- Surely you're not saying
We have the resources
To save the poor from their lot
There will be poor always pathetically struggling
Look at the good things you've got
Think while you still have me
Move while you still see me
You'll be lost and you'll be sorry
When I'm gone
[ Mary Magdalene ]
Sleep and I shall soothe you calm you and anoint you
- Myrrh for your hot forehead
- Oh
Then you'll feel everything's all right, yes
Everything's fine and it's cool and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet
Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Think of nothing tonight
- Tonight close your eyes and relax
- Think of nothing
- Close your eyes, Close your eyes
- And relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
- Close your eyes
Close your eyes and relax
- Everything's all right, yes
Everything's all right, yes
Everything's all right
Good Caiaphas
The Council waits for you
The Pharisees
And priests are here for you
Ah, gentlemen
You know why we are here
We've not much time
And quite a problem here
[ Men ]
Hosanna, Superstar
Hosanna
Superstar
[ Women ]
Hosanna, Superstar
Hosanna
Superstar
Listen to that howling mob
Of blockheads in the street
A trick or two with lepers
And the whole town's on its feet
[ All ]
He is dangerous
Jesus Christ
Superstar
He is dangerous
Tell us that you're who they say you are
That man is in town right now to whip up some support
A rabble-rousing mission that I think we must abort
He is dangerous
Jesus Christ
Superstar
He is dangerous
[ Chattering ]
Look, Caiaphas
They're right outside our yard
Quick, Caiaphas
Go call the Roman guard
No, wait
We need a more permanent solution to our problem
What then to do about Jesus of Nazareth
Miracle wonderman hero of fools
No riots, no army no fighting, no slogans
One thing I'll say for him
Jesus is cool
We cannot leave him to his own devices
His half-witted fans will get out of control
- How can we stop him
- His glamour increases
- By leaps every minute
- He's top of the pole
I see bad things arising
The crowd crowned him king which the Romans would ban
I see blood and destruction
Our elimination because of one man
Blood and destruction because of one man
[ All ]
Because, because, because of one man
Our elimination because of one man
Because, because because of one
Cause of one cause of one man
[ Priest ] What then to do about this Jesus mania
[ Annas ] Oh, how do we deal with the carpenter-king
[ Priest ] Where do we start with a man who is bigger
Than John was when John did his baptism thing
Fools, you have no perception
The stakes we are gambling are frighteningly high
We must crush him completely
So like John before him this Jesus must die
For the sake of the nation this Jesus must die
[ All ] Must die, Must die
This Jesus must die
So like John before him this Jesus must die
Must die, Must die
This Jesus must, Jesus must
Jesus must die
[ Trumpets ]
Hosanna, Heysanna
Sanna, sanna, ho
Sanna, heysanna hosanna
Hey, J.C., J.C.
Won't you smile at me
Sanna, hosanna
Hey, superstar
Tell the rabble to be quiet
We anticipate a riot
This common crowd
Is much too loud
Tell the mob who sing your song
That they are fools and they are wrong
They are a curse
They should disperse
Hosanna, heysanna
Sanna, sanna, ho
Sanna, heysanna hosanna
Hey, J.C., J.C.
You're all right by me
Sanna, hosanna
Hey, superstar
Why waste your breath moaning at the crowd
Nothing can be done to stop the shouting
If every tongue were still
The noise would still continue
The rocks and stones themselves
Would start to sing
Hosanna, heysanna sanna, sanna, ho
Sanna, heysanna hosanna
Hey, J.C., J.C. won't you fight for me
Sanna, hosanna
Hey, superstar
Sing me your songs but not for me alone
Sing out for yourselves...
For you are blessed
There is not one of you who cannot win the Kingdom
The slow, the suffering
The quick, the dead
Hosanna, heysanna sanna, sanna, ho
Sanna, heysanna hosanna
Hey, J.C., J.C. would you die for me
Sanna, hosanna
Hey, superstar

I believe in you and God so tell me that I'm saved

I believe in you and God so tell me that I'm saved
Jesus, I am with you
Touch me, Touch me, Jesus
Jesus, I am on your side
Kiss me, Kiss me, Jesus
Christ, what more do you need to convince you
That you've made it and you're easily as strong
As the filth from Rome who rape our country
And who've terrorized our people for so long
[ Vocalizing ]
Jesus, I am with you
Touch me, Touch me, Jesus

- There must be over 50,000
- Screamin' love and more for you
- Love, love, love
And every one of 50,000
- Would do whatever ya asked them to

Keep them yellin' their devotion
But add a touch of hate at Rome
You will rise to greater power
We will win ourselves a home

Oh
Forever
Amen
A... ha-ah-ah ah-ah-ah
...men
Neither you, Simon
Nor the 50,000
Nor the Romans nor the Jews
Nor Judas nor the twelve
Nor the priests nor the scribes
Nor doomed Jerusalem itself
Understand what power is
Understand what glory is
Understand at all
Understand at all
If you knew
All that I knew
My poor Jerusalem
You'd see the truth
But you'd close your eyes
But you'd close your eyes
While you live
Your troubles are many
Poor Jerusalem
To conquer death
You only have to die
You only have to die
I dreamed
I met a Galilean
A most amazing man
He had that look you very rarely find
The haunting, hunted kind
I asked him to say what had happened
How it all began
I asked again
He never said a word
As if he hadn't heard
And next the room was full
Of wild and angry men
They seemed to hate this man
They fell on him and then
Disappeared again
Then I saw thousands of millions
Crying for this man
And then I heard them mentioning my name
And leaving me the blame
[ Chorus ]

[ Bleating ]
Roll on up, Jerusalem
Come on in, Jerusalem
Sunday, here we go again
Live in me, Jerusalem
Here you live, Jerusalem
Here you breathe, Jerusalem
While your temple still survives you at least are still alive
I got things you won't believe
Name your pleasure, I will sell
I can fix your wildest needs
I got heaven, I got hell
Roll on up for my price is down
Come on in for the best in town
Take your pick of the finest wine
Lay your bets on this bird of mine
What you see is what you get
No one's been disappointed yet
Don't be scared
Give me a try
There is nothing you can't buy
Name your price, I got everything
Hurry, It's all going fast
Borrow cash on the finest terms
Hurry now while stocks still last
[ Crowd Chattering ]
Roll on up, Jerusalem
Come on in, Jerusalem
Sunday, here we go again

Here you live, Jerusalem
Here you breathe, Jerusalem
While your temple still survives you at least are still alive
I got things you won't believe
Name your pleasure, I will sell
[ Screaming ]
[ Woman Screaming ]
My temple should be
A house of prayer
But you have made it
A den of thieves
Get out !
Get out !
[ Crowd Screaming,
Yelling ]
My time ls almost through
Little left to do
After all, I've tried for three years
Seems like 30
Feels like 30
See my eyes
I can hardly see
See me stand
I can hardly walk
I believe you can make me whole
See my tongue
I can hardly talk
See my skin
I'm a mass of blood
See my legs
I can hardly stand
I believe you can make me well
See my purse
I'm a poor, poor man
[ All ] Will you touch
Will you mend me, Christ
Won't you touch
Won't you heal me, Christ
Will you kiss
You can cure me, Christ
Won't you kiss
Won't you pay me, Christ
See my eyes
I can hardly see
See me stand
I can hardly walk
I believe you can make me whole
See my tongue
I can hardly talk
See my skin
I'm a mass of blood
See my legs
I can hardly stand
I believe you can make me well
See my purse
I'm a poor, poor man
Will you touch
Will you mend me, Christ
Won't you touch
Will you heal me, Christ
Will you kiss
You can cure me, Christ
Won't you kiss
Won't you pay me, Christ
See my eyes

- [ Jesus Moaning ]
- There's too many of you !
- I believe you can make me well
- Don't push me !
- See my purse, I'm a poor, poor man
- Will you touch
Will you mend me, Christ
- There's too little of me.
- Will you kiss
You can cure me, Christ
- Don't crowd me !
See my eyes
I can hardly see
- Leave me alone !
- I believe you can make me whole
See my tongue
I can hardly talk
Jesus !
Touch me, Jesus !
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
And forget all about us
Tonight
I don't know how to love him
What to do
How to move him
I've been changed
Yes, really changed ln these past few days when I've seen myself
I seem like someone else
I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me
He's a man
He's just a man
And I've had so many men before ln very many ways
He's just one more
Should I bring him down
Should I scream and shout
Should I speak of love
Let my feelings out
I never thought
I'd come to this
What's it all about
Don't ya think it's rather funny
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been
So calm, so cool
No lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so
I never thought
I'd come to this
What's it all about
Yet if he said he loved me
I'd be lost
I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope
Just couldn't cope
I'd turn my head
I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so
I want him so
I love him
So
[ Engines Roaring ]
Now if I help you it matters that you see
These sordid kind of things are coming hard to me
It's taken me some time to work out what to do
I weighed the whole thing out before I came to you
I have no thought at all about my own reward
I really didn't come here of my own accord
Just don't say I'm
Damned for all time
I came because I had to
I'm the one who saw
Jesus can't control it like he did before
Furthermore, I know that Jesus thinks so too
Jesus wouldn't mind that I was here with you
I have no thought at all about my own reward
I really didn't come here of my own accord
Just don't say I'm
Damned for all time
Annas, you're a friend a worldly man and wise
Caiaphas, my friend
I know you sympathize
Why are we the prophets
Why are we the ones
We see the sad solution
Know what must be done
I have no thought at all about my own reward
I really didn't come here of my own accord
Just don't say I'm
Damned
For all time
Cut the protesting
Forget the excuses
We want information
Get up off the floor
We have the papers we need to arrest him
You know his movements
We know the law
Your help in this matter won't go unrewarded
We'll pay you in silver cash on the nail
We just need to know where the soldiers can find him
- With no crowd 'round him
- Then we can't fail
I don't want your blood money
Oh, that doesn't matter
Our expenses are good
I don't need your blood money
But you might as well take it
We think that you should
Think of the things you can do with that money
Choose any charity
Give to the poor
We've noted your motives
We've noted your feelings
This isn't blood money
It's a--
- A fee.
- A fee, nothing more
On Thursday night
You'll find him where you want him
Far from the crowds ln the Garden
Of Gethsemane
[ Chorus ]
So long, Judas
So long, Judas
[ Jets Roaring ]
Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine
Don't disturb me now
I can see the answers
Till this evening is this morning
Life is fine
Always hoped that
I'd be an apostle
Knew that I would make it if I tried
Then when we retire
We can write the Gospels
So they'll still talk about us when we've died
The end ls just a little harder
When brought about
By friends
For all you care
This wine could be my blood
For all you care
This bread
Could be my body
The end.
This is my blood you drink
This is my body you eat lf you would, remember me
When you eat and drink
I must be mad thinking I'll be remembered
Yes, I must be out of my head
Look at your blank faces
My name will mean nothing
Ten minutes after I'm dead
One of you denies me
One of you betrays me
[ Apostles Shouting ]
No ! No !
[ Indistinct Shouting ]
Peter will deny me
- No, not me !
- ln just a few hours
Three times will deny me
And that's not all I see
One of you here dining
One of my 12 chosen
Will leave to betray me
Cut out the dramatics
You know very well who
- Why don't you go do it ?
- You want me to do it ?
- Hurry, they are waiting
- lf you knew why I do it
I don't care why you do it
To think I admired you
Well, now I despise you
- You liar, you Judas
- You wanted me to do it
What if I just stayed here and ruined your ambition
Christ, you deserve it
Hurry, you fool
Hurry and go
Save me your speeches
I don't want to know
Go, Go
Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine
What's that in the bread
It's gone to my head
Till this morning is this evening
Life is fine
Always hoped that
I'd be an apostle
Knew that I would make it if I tried
Then when we retire we can write the Gospels
So they'll all talk about us when we've died
You sad pathetic man
See where you brought us to
Our ideals die around us and all because of you
But the saddest cut of all
Someone had to turn you in
Like a common criminal
Like a wounded animal
A jaded mandarin
A jaded mandarin
Like a jaded, faded faded, jaded, jaded mandarin
Get out
They're waiting
Get out
They're waiting
Oh, they're waiting for you
Every time I look at you
I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand
You'd have managed better if you'd had it planned
A-a-a-ah
[ Bleating ]
Always hoped that
I'd be an apostle
Knew that I would make it if I tried lf I tried lf I tried
Then when we retire we can write the Gospels
So they'll still talk about us
When we've died
Will no one stay awake with me
Peter, John, James
Will none of you wait with me
Peter
John
James
I only want to say lf there is a way
Take this cup away from me
For I don't want to taste its poison
Feel it burn me
I have changed
I'm not as sure as when we started
Then, I was inspired
Now
I'm sad and tired
Listen
Surely I've exceeded expectations
Tried for three years
Seems like 30
Could You ask as much
From any other man
But if I die
See the saga through
And do the things
You ask of me
Let them hate me hit me, hurt me
Nail me to their tree
I'd want to know
I'd want to know, my God
I'd want to know
I'd want to know, my God
I'd want to see
I'd want to see, my God
I'd want to see
I'd want to see, my God
Why I
Should die
Would I be more noticed than I ever was before
Would the things
I've said and done
Matter any more
I'd have to know
I'd have to know, my Lord
I'd have to know
I'd have to know, my Lord
I'd have to see
I'd have to see, my Lord
I'd have to see
I'd have to see, my Lord lf I die what will be my reward lf I die what will be my reward
Have to know
I'd have to know, my Lord
Have to know
I'd have to know, my Lord
Why
Why should I die
Oh, why should I die
Can You show me now
That I would not be killed in vain
Show me just a little
Of Your omnipresent brain
Show me there's a reason for Your wanting me to die
You're far too keen on where and how
But not so hot on why
All right
I'll die
Oh, Oh
Just watch me die
See how
See how I'll die
Oh-h-h
Just watch me die
Then
I was inspired
Now
I'm sad and tired.
After all
I've tried for three years.
Seems like 90.
Why then am I scared to finish
What I started
What You started
I didn't start it.
God
Thy will is hard
But You hold every card
I will drink
Your cup of poison
Nail me to Your cross
And break me
Bleed me
Beat me, Kill me
Take me now
Before I change my mind
Judas, must you betray me...
With a kiss
What's the buzz
Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz
Tell me what's happenin'
What's happenin'
What's the buzz

Hang on, Lord
We're gonna fight for you
- Hang on, Lord
We're gonna fight for you
- Hang on, Lord
Hang on, Lord
We're gonna fight for you
- Hang on, Lord
We're gonna fight for you
- We're gonna fight for you
Put away your sword
Don't you know that it's all over
It was nice, but
Now it's gone
Why are you obsessed with fighting
Stick to fishing from now on
[ Indistinct Chatter ]
[ Man Laughing ]
Tell me, Christ how you feel tonight
Do you plan to put up a fight
Do you feel that you've had the breaks
What would you say were your big mistakes
Do you think that you may retire
Did you think you would get much higher
How do you view your coming trial
Have your men proved it's all worthwhile
Come with us to see Caiaphas
You'll just love the high priest's house
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die in the high priest's house
Come on, God
This is not like you
Let us know what you're gonna do
You know what your supporters feel
You'll escape in the final reel
Tell me, Christ how you feel tonight
Do you plan to put up a fight
Do you feel that you had the breaks
What would you say were your big mistakes
Come with us to see Caiaphas
You'll just love the high priest's house
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas
You'll just die in the high priest's house
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him now
We have got him now
Jesus, you must realize
The serious charges facing you
You say you're the Son of God in all your handouts
Well, is it true
That's what you say
You say that I am
There you have it, gentlemen
What more evidence do we need
Judas, thank you for the victim
Stay a while
You'll see it bleed
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Now we have him
Now we've got him
Take him to Pilate
Take him to Pilate
Take him to Pilate
Take him to Pilate
I think I've seen you somewhere
I remember.
You were with that man they took away
I recognize your face
You've got the wrong man, lady
I don't know him
And I wasn't where he was tonight
Never near the place
That's strange for I am sure
I saw you with him
You were right by his side and yet you denied
I tell you
I was never, ever with him
But I saw you too.
He looked just like you.
I don't know him !
Peter, don't you know what you have said
You've gone and cut him dead
I had to do it
Don't you see
Or else they'd go for me
It's what he told us you would do
I wonder how he knew
[ Crowd Shouting ]
[ Shouting Continues ]
- Come on. Come on.
- There he is, see? Hurry. Come on.
Who is
This broken man
Cluttering up
My hallway
Who is this unfortunate
Someone Christ
King of the Jews
Oh. So this is
Jesus Christ.
I am really quite surprised
You look so small.
Not a king at all.
We all know that you are news
But are you King ?
King of the Jews
Your words, not mine.
What do
You mean by that
That is not an answer
You're deep ln trouble, friend
Someone Christ
King of the Jews
How can someone in your state
Be so cool about his fate
An amazing thing, this silent king.
Since you come from Galilee
Then you need not come to me
You're Herod's race.
[ Chuckles ]
You're Herod's case.
Hey, hosanna
Heysanna
Sanna sanna ho
Sanna, heysanna, ho and how
Hey, J.C., J.C.
Please explain to me
You had everything
Where is it now
Jesus, I am overjoyed...
To meet you face to face
You've been getting quite a name...
All around the place
Healing cripples
- Ooh.
- Raising from the dead
[ All Gasping ]
Now I understand you're God
[ Gasping ]
Hmm ? Huh ?
Mmm.
At least that's what you've said
So
You are the Christ
You're the great Jesus Christ
Prove to me that you're divine
Change my water into wine
That's all you need do
Then I'll know it's all true
Come on
King of the Jews
Jesus, you just won't believe the hit you've made around here
You are all we talk about
You're the wonder of the year
Oh, what a pity if it's all a lie
Still I'm sure that you can rock the cynics if you try
So if you are the Christ
Yes, the great Jesus Christ
Prove to me that you're no fool
Walk across my swimming pool
- lf you do that for me
- Whoo !
- Then I'll let you go free
- Whoo !
Come on
King of the Jews
I only ask what I'd ask any superstar
What is it that you have got that puts you where you are
Oh-ho-ho
I am waiting
Yes, I'm a captive fan
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man
So if you are the Christ
Yes, the great Jesus Christ
Feed my household with this bread
You can do it on your head
Uh, or has something gone wrong ?
Jesus, why do you take so long ?
Aw, come on,
King of the Jews !
Hey, aren't you
Scared of me, Christ
Mister wonderful Christ
Aaah !
You're a joke !
You're not the Lord.
You're nothing but a fraud.
Take him away
He's got nothing to say
Get out, you King of the--
Get out, King of the-- Oh !
Get out, you King of the Jews !
Get out of here !
You-- You--
Get out of here, you !
Get out of my life !
I've been living to see you
Dying to see you but it shouldn't be like this
This was unexpected
What do I do now
Could we start again please
I've been very hopeful so far
Now for the first time
I think we're going wrong
Hurry up and tell me
This is just a dream
Or could we start again please
I think you've made your point now
You've even gone a bit too far to get the message home
Before it gets too frightening
We ought to call a halt
So could we start again please
I've been living to see you
Dying to see you but it shouldn't be like this
This was unexpected
What do I do now
Could we start again please
Could we start again please
I think you've made your point now

Could we start again please
Could we start again please

My God
I saw him
He looked three-quarters dead and he was so bad I had to turn my head
You beat him so hard that he was bent and lame
And I know who everybody's gonna blame
I don't believe he knows
I acted for our good
I'd save him all this suffering if I could
Don't believe
Our good
And I'd save him if I could
Cut the confessions
Forget the excuses
I don't understand why you're filled with remorse
All that you've said has come true with a vengeance
The mob turned against him
You backed the right horse
What you have done will be the saving of everyone
You'll be remembered forever for this
And not only that
You've been paid for your efforts
Pretty good wages for one little kiss
Christ, I know you can't hear me
But I only did what you wanted me to
Christ, I'd sell out the nation
For I have been saddled with the murder of you
I have been spattered with innocent blood
I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud
I have been spattered with innocent blood
I shall be dragged through the slime and the slime and the
Slime and the mud
I
Don't know how to love him
I don't know why he moves me
He's a man
He's just a man
He is not a king
He's just the same
As anyone I know
He scares me so
When he's cold and dead
Will he let me be
Does he love
Does he love me too
Does he care for me
My mind is--
It's in darkness.
God. God, I'm sick !
I've been used !
And You knew all the time !
God-- God, I will never know why You chose me... for Your crime !
For Your bloody crime !
You have murdered me !
Mur-- Murdered me !
Murdered me ! Murdered me !
Murdered me ! Murdered me !
Murdered me ! Murdered-- !
So long, Judas
So long, Judas
So long, Judas
And so, the king is once again my guest
And why is this
Was Herod unimpressed
[ Caiaphas ]
We turn to Rome
To sentence Nazareth
We have no law
To put a man to death
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do
Talk to me, Jesus Christ
You have been brought here
Manacled, beaten, by your own people.
Do you have the first idea why you deserve it ?
Listen, King of the Jews
Where is your kingdom
Look at me
Am I a Jew
I have no kingdom.
In this world,
I'm through.
- Talk to me, Jesus Christ
- There may be a kingdom... for me somewhere.
If you only knew.
- Then you are a king.
- It's you that say I am
I look for truth and find that I get damned
And what is truth ls truth unchanging law
We both have truths
Are mine the same as yours
[ Crowd ]
Crucify him ! Crucify him !
What do you mean ?
You'd crucify your king ?
[ Crowd ]
We have no king but Caesar
He's done no wrong.
No, not the slightest thing.
We have no king but Caesar
Crucify him
Well, this is new.
Respect for Caesar !
Until now, this has been noticeably lacking.
Who is this Jesus ?
Why is he different ?
You Jews produce messiahs by the sackful.
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do
Talk to me
Jesus Christ
Look at your Jesus Christ
I'll agree he's mad
Ought to be locked up
But that is not a reason to destroy him
He's a sad little man not a king or god
Not a thief
I need a crime
[ Shouting ]
Crucify him ! Crucify him !
Crucify him !
Crucify him !
Behold the man
Behold your shattered king
We have no king but Caesar
You hypocrites
You hate us more than him
We have no king but Caesar
Crucify him
I see no reason
I find no evil
This man is harmless so why does he upset you
He's just misguided
Thinks he's important
But to keep you vultures happy,
I shall flog him !

Father, forgive them.
They don't know what they're doing.
My God. My God, why have You forgotten me ?
Father, into Your hands...
I commend... my spirit.
This is a film you want to make... but do I, or television, or audiences really need it?
Besides it's full of booby traps and blacked-out areas...
No one's made a film about the fifties yet.
I'm not an idiot; I'm very serious about this.
I'm not interested in doing any old film for my thesis.
This film needs a good director.
You're very young.
You'll get some old codger who knew him, saw him, who knows!
This is my subject.
Besides, I've already started it.
I'll give you another one, "steel".
That's what interests us, it's essential and not hypocritical.
I learned my subject matter from my father.
I'm giving you good advice.
I have contacts, materials, interviews, really good stuff.
Young people will be interested...
You're ignoring the facts... steelworkers, mills, the increases in steel production...
So you haven't got the materials for me?
I'm not interested in controversy.
It would be the end of... me, you and your film.
Those materials have always been off-limits.
This is bottom line, understand?
- How old are you?
And you have 21 days to finish shooting.

We're from Polish Television...
Yes, the director told me to assist you.
The museum's closed today, so I'm afraid there isn't much light.
What's this film about, anyway?
The director would like to know.
Do you have a script?
Yes, I do.

Keep her busy.
What's down there?
Nothing interesting, the oldest collections.
- Before World War II?
- No, 25 years ago.
We're the only institution which buys works of art.
- Were they ever displayed?
- Of course.
- Didn't you see them?
- I was born too late.
Where are you going?
Let's go back, there's nothing there.
I just want to look around a bit.
- What's going on here?
- I'll explain...
Is there enough light?
We'll manage if we raise it and put the camera on a tripod.
What tripod?!
Well, well, my dear...
I like that one.
That's strange.
May I ask... why that one?
There are far better pieces here.
I don't know.
It's not important.
Could I take some pictures?
Pictures?!
The director doesn't even like... people visiting here.
Good morning, please prepare the film.
Hello...
Can you hear me, gentlemen?
Yes, good morning...
Good morning.
Good morning.
Perhaps we could arrange a hotel room for you.
It'd be cheaper than sleeping here.
Hello.
I've chosen materials which more or less concern that bricklayer.
More or less.
This stuff's 25 years old and it's hard to remember everything.
Are you going to sit there or next to me?
I don't know if there's anything to choose from here.
It's boring footage.
This is your thesis?
So you think it's boring?
I'm not here to think,
I'm here to splice.
- What did you do at school?
- Short studies.
Cortazar's, of course.
Or maybe your own screenplay?
- Agnieszka.
- I did different things.
I know, life as it happens, hidden cameras...
Television likes that, audiences less, but they'll give you a job.
Roll the film, please.
- What do we have here?
- A profile of Birkut, fascinating!
- Have you ever met him?
- Only his statue.
There were better looking guys.
Why him?
I don't know.
Maybe because he was tipped over.
I'd advise you to choose quickly.
Projection rooms are hard to get.
These are outtakes.
They never made it into any film.
For technical reasons, of course..
Hold on, this is called
"A City is Born."
It was supposed to be called that.
A thesis piece too, by Burski.
I haven't cut anything, pretty soon you'll see Birkut.
Also outtakes.
Here he comes...
That's him.
Birkut, Mateusz.
Where do you come from?
Lencz, a village near Krakow.
Parents?
They live there.
What does your father do?
He has some land.
A lot?
Not much.
Did you work anywhere else earlier?
On the land.
- So you don't know anything.
- No, I do...
On that land...
What are they angry about?
The fish, I guess.
I love fish.
But only one fish for dinner...
I understand.
- Burski made these kinds of films?
- He quickly stopped.
Now you'll see a fragment of his film titled:
"Building our Happiness."
I've chosen the parts with Birkut.
The rest is very similar.
Please roll the film.
We're ready.
Building our Happiness.
A film by Jerzy Burski.
The festively decorated main hall of Warsaw's Polytechnic... and the annual New Year's
Eve Ball... for those most deserving:
Party and government dignitaries... lead workers... farmers, teachers, and academics.
Among them, Mateusz Birkut, a leading worker from Nowa Huta.
Mateusz Birkut, from a poor village... with thousands of others... joins the battle for a better tomorrow.
A huge steel mill is being built near Krakow... together with a new city.
This marks the site where, on April 26, 1950... the first worker began construction.
From across Poland, stream... masses of workers, including volunteers from the Youth Union... and Service to Poland.
As the city grows, so do the people.
They are not alone.
Management lends a hand... by providing... worker's hotels... where, after work, they can relax and do some reading.
It was here on the building site... that Mateusz Birkut... began, together with other young volunteers.
Under the watchful eye of experienced bricklayers... like Ozanski and others... he learned this demanding and beautiful trade.
The honorable title
"builder of Nowa Huta"... demands not only manual labor... but academic work too and everyone can learn here.
Mateusz Birkut took full advantage of the opportunity.
He worked and studied...
Here is where he met his future wife.
We know her from the newsreels.
Hanka Tomczyk, the pride of...
Nowa Huta athletes, began like everyone and leaned to live... and work here.
The landscape is changing.
Where once were fields... we now see Nowa Huta, the largest investment of the 6-year plan.
President Bierut's arrival is a holiday for the crew.
A warm welcome, applause... a handshake and a moment that many... have dreamed of.
A leading worker, Hanka Tomczyk... feels distinguished.
It was then that
Mateusz Birkut... took up the challenge of the other bricklayers, 30,000 bricks... laid in one shift.
That was his slogan.
It happened here.
A result like that required efficient teamwork.
We see it here, a good team.
Many came to watch, to nervously observe...
Will they do it?
They've done it!...30 thousand...
509 bricks.
The five heroes at the finish line.
Now flowers, handshakes and cheers.
Such was the beginning of his march to later successes.
Comrades selected Mateusz Birkut... to be a delegate to the
Builders' Convention... and later to the Convention of lead workers.
And so men like Birkut became the inspiration for artists.
A marble statue takes form... a symbol of the heroism of our bricklayers.
An art exhibition at the Zacheta
Gallery in Warsaw.
It is opened by the one whose statue is the... centerpiece of the showing.
Mateusz Birkut may claim with satisfaction that:
"We have played our part... in the revolution in Polish art."
Indeed.
They were its engine... raw material, and substance.
The people were now on canvas.
Look at... the degenerate works of artists... from the capitalistic west.
It's no accident they have removed from the human form... its shape... and substance.
Here comes old Krakow, while right behind... it's younger sister...
Nowa Huta, as old as the 6-year plan.
The "Trumanillo" circus was a hit.
Mr. Truman and his friends, reactionary rats and insects.
Eisenhower and Adenauer as bride and groom.
Franco dressed as Carmen.
And, kicked out of Korea...
McArthur.
People reach out for... quickly printed... leaflets.
As if symbolizing the millions of hands which, thanks to the...
People's Republic, have received books and newspapers.
The day long-dreamed of arrives.
They receive their own flat.
One of those which they built with their own hands and hearts.
Mateusz and Hanka Birkut have a home of their own.
They are understandably moved.
All around them they see the fruits of their joint efforts.
In each block of flats there is a drop of their sweat.
Is that everything?
Yes.
I'd like this shown too.
I found a little filler.
Roll the film, please.
Just a minute...
There's no sound, as it was never used... for "technical" reasons.
Roll it.
What was all that about?
I cut and splice film, I don't get involved with the subject matter.
What happened to him later?
We'll find that out in your film.
I saw the film about Birkut.
You must know it.
- I shot the pictures.
- But Burski made it!
He directed and edited.
That was...
It got an award, it did.
That was a long time ago, 24 years.
I'd like to talk to Burski.
Good idea, Burski likes to support young talent.
Is he in Warsaw?
No, he's returning from some festival.
I heard they're going to meet him at the airport.
It's a good idea to keep your ear to the ground.
What are you so worried about?
Times are tough, Agnieszka.
I'd like to... keep working.
But I guess this'll be my last film.
I've written to the Minister... with a request to let me continue.
I haven't had an answer yet.
We're ready!
We're not going to use a tripod.
Only handheld and wide-angle lens just like the new American films...
I was only on the jury.
I'm pleased by the success... but it belongs to them.
But it's thanks to you that
Polish films are recognized world-wide.
I'm flattered by your opinion, but it was really them...
There's a woman here from
Polish Television...
But I'm going to Prague today!
Your tickets are all taken care of.
So you're the television lady?
Just don't ask me about the trip or the festival; please be original.
I'm doing my thesis.
A film.
What about?
A simple story, here's the title,
"Stars of a Single Season."
Sports stars or screen stars?
Former lead workers.
Then and now.
That's history.
For me, ancient history.
That's why I want to make this film.
How moving.
And I'm to be granddad by the fireplace... telling tales of how we built
Warsaw and Nowa Huta, eh?
That's very moving.
But impossible, as I'm leaving today.
To Prague, I know.
When I return, perhaps?
What are you doing this afternoon?
Me?
Different things.
Good-bye.
Too bad.
You knew Birkut, didn't you?
Knew Him?!
He was my greatest discovery!
That was my biggest stunt.
You think this Birkut, now...?
I'm simply curious.
The story if his career, and what followed.
The story of a career?
First some materials from the archives...
With your permission.
...then a few interviews, cinema verite, but that's old hat.
I saw one of your earlier films.
Which one?
- "Building our Happiness."
- "A City is Born."
It's too bad you never finished it.
Are you doing a film about Birkut, or about me?
You see, I don't lament over... my own, "what followed?"
Anna Maria! Marysia!
Daddy!
You forgot your dog.
Tell me, what's his name?
- Where's my wife?
- Off on a shooting session.
- When will she be back?
- Late...
My dear lady, film, especially a documentary, is not literature.
There's no tomorrow, everything is now or never.
You have to know what's important, have that awareness...
I was once young, as you are now, and I had to start somewhere.
Nothing worked for two years, until I finally got smart.
And you made your mark with Birkut?
I wanted to do a film about someone else, but all the better... lead workers already had backers.
Older colleagues of mine had every construction record... clenched in their teeth like a bone.
Marysia...?
So I had to think up...
Something to drink?
I needed an idea and so
I thought up Birkut.
At first it was only a vague outline.
It concerned... the fact, not the person, and only took form in Nowa Huta.
I used to go there often, shooting short pieces for the newsreels.
Hi.
What are you filming today?
We've got new showers.
Warm water and free soap.
Violet-scented toilet bars?
I'll wait till there's shampoo.
What is it?
What have you got for the upcoming
Trade Union Congress?
That.
We're building.
So, you're building.
That's not a stunt.
What's a stunt?
Something hot and loud, that's a stunt.
Stupal was a stunt.
10,000 bricks in one shift!
Not some "We're building."
I hear you, comrade.
But records are once in a blue moon, but we have a good crew... good technology and organization.
In the long run...
Forget that...
Besides, you can have both.
Let's do a stunt for 30,000.
Comrade, you have two hands.
So does a bricklayer.
I'd have to give him two more.
Mr. Jodla, I don't know anything about laying bricks.
What's the "three-man" system?
You want the short version?
It's like this.
A bricklayer used to work alone, now he has two helpers.
And they lay 20 thousand?
Maybe they do, maybe they don't.
I've never seen it done.
That's what the papers say.
So give him four, six, eight, ten, the whole association.
And I'll film it.
It was there, in Nowa Huta, that I saw him clearly.
We have to find a tough guy, one who'll last the eight hours.
Who do you think will make it?
Adamowski, Stepniak?
Afterwards we'll send him on vacation to Krynica.
Hold on, not so fast!
His helpers have to be the best too.
Before that, in secret...
Are you crazy, lay bricks in secret?
Sure, for an hour, to rehearse.
The rest depends on how the work's organized.
If we create the best conditions... we might just pull it off.
It's midnight.
It's midnight already, Birkut.
You'll never get up tomorrow.
Yes I will.
I can do a lot, if I have to.
We need five.
You think you won't find five crazies on a site like this?
But we can't blow it.
That's a shit-load of bricks.
We'll lay them.
Just so it's not a circus.
You know, for the camera.
Me, for the camera?
I'm doing it for me, to see if you can build a house in two weeks.
Why not one week?
Who the hell knows, maybe?
Everybody would have a home...
Yeah, that's true.
So, is it a deal?
Get some sleep.
I can't.
Count bricks, that'll help.
Ten thousand calories a day!
- For how long?
- Two weeks.
What's the matter? ...Eat!
I'm full.
- Just one more slice...
- I can't!
Coffee?
- It's no good, it's bitter.
- So what? ...drink some anyway.
It'll make you stronger.
- All right, half then.
- All of it.
It's real, Brazilian.
I made sure he had the best conditions.
I'm ready.
With a mug like that?
He needs a shave.
All of them do.
I shave on Sundays.
It's Thursday.
- What time is it?
- It's late.
Send a car into town and bring back some barbers!
This is Jodla!
Barbers with razors.
We're going to do some shaving!
- Ties?
- No, no...
Cigarette?
I'm glad you're here.
I want to cover some details.
The camera's simply a tool, it registers what it sees.
I would've shaved yesterday if you'd have told me.
The barbers will be here soon.
You have to look good...
I understand...
But you can't do that.
I'll do whatever I have to...
But you can't force-feed people like they were geese.
Fine, now let's agree.
When I say "camera"... you work lightly and easily.
When I say "stop"... you work as you normally do.
I'll make it.
All clear.
Who's that?
Just in case.
We have to be careful.
Maybe I'll do it myself?
Maybe I'll do it myself?
Cologne?
Go ahead.
Now back to the barrack.
I can't film them coming out of the office, and get the audience.
Let the audience go.
This is Polish Radio...
from the residential housing development in Nowa Huta.
We are located at the largest...
construction site of the 6-year plan, a steel mill...
and city for 100,000 residents.
Before Polish workers start up the Soviet machines...
Polish bricklayers are going to attempt an ambitious feat...
Ready?
Energetically, go on, easy does it, more like workers!
Mr. Birkut looks good, the rest are too stiff.
That's not it.
Back inside.
Let's try it again.
Mateusz Birkut's brigade...
aims to lay 28,000 bricks during the course of one shift...
The crew consists of five men.
One man lays only the exterior layer of bricks...
directing the others, who do the rest.
Working alone, one man can lay
1,750 bricks, at the most.
Mateusz Birkut's brigade will lay 28,000.
Feelings are high...
and shared by all those present...
Ready!
Start!
What are you doing?
Let's do it again.
Go to the office.
The battle against time has begun.
We see a perfect example of organization and...
enthusiasm which these boys have brought to this difficult task.
Happy!...Happy!...Great!
We see their toil and we all know...
that this achievement is possible...
thanks to the self-sacrifice of our heroic working class!
We have the first results...
We're rolling!
Smile!
Let's see your face!
Mateusz Birkut's feat may launch a revolution
in construction techniques.
It's not only a building foundation which is being laid...
but the foundations of a new life...
and prosperity for working people as well.
Are you falling asleep?
Start playing!
What's going on?
Come here!...Hurry up!
The next stage, the sixth layer.
They've been working for four hours.
13,926 bricks have been laid.
Briskly and more cheerfully...
Briskly and more cheerfully!
Hurry up!
Everybody's waiting!
Stand up here and start playing.
Play, play!
Polish Radio listeners...
the sixth hour of work...
has now passed.
The tenth layer is finished, a total of 23,210 bricks.
One more hour.
What's wrong?
They're doing fine.
I'm worried about them.
It's going well, they'll make it.
The battle against time and fatigue continues.
We've reached the final minutes...
the final bricks, the final effort.
- There's no more mint tea.
- But it's going well.
The shift is over!
30,509 bricks!
An incredible record!
Birkut's team not only laid...
the 28,000 they said they would...
but a great many more!
Shift's over!
Shift's over.
Our sincere congratulations.
It's a moving moment for everyone.
I'm sorry.
What a man!
Stop, let's do it again.
Take the flowers.
Birkut, look lively and happy!
Two more bricks, then come down.
Another achievement in the fight for the 6-year plan and for peace.
You'll go far, I'll see to it.
I'm keeping this brick as a souvenir.
I didn't lie, he did get far.
You both did.
Well, sure.
- But he...
- Where is he?
You're making a film about him and you don't know where he is?
I have this idea...
- of following his footsteps.
- Interesting, but it's been done.
So what?
Tell me more.
I lost track of him.
I had work, trips abroad...
How about having dinner with us?
I saw his picture being taken down in a newsreel.
It happens.
They put them up, take them down.
Wait... he hired a bunch of Gypsies.
They followed him, played music, he broke a window somewhere...
Ask around, lot's of people knew him.
I can give you an address.
OK, a letter of introduction too.
Are you going somewhere?
It's everything I own.
Not much.
It's easier to make films that way.
Perhaps you're right.
Testing, one, two, three.
Make sure you get it down.
Testing, one, two...
I want to leave.
Wait a minute!
Quit shoving!
Where are you going?
To Mr. Michalak, the director.
Where are we going, and what for?
This is absolutely crazy!
Mr. Michalak?
Mr. Michalak, I have a letter for you.
- Strip tease or topless?
- Everything, if you help me.
Please get undressed.
Please listen to me.
I'm making a film and Burski gave me your name.
I'm having problems and
I need to talk to you.
You're the only one who can...
Later.
But it'll only take a few minutes.
They have their models, big butts are what count, to land softly.
Very good, today's youth is much better looking.
So you're interested in Birkut?
That's good, young people should know their fathers' history... and learn from their mistakes.
Well?
I'd like you to tell me.
You know which period interests me?
I should think so.
From the time he was burned?
Everything was fine until then.
Truth was he no longer laid bricks.
He didn't have the time.
They moved him to the inspectorate, to the association.
I felt then that it wasn't for him.
What?
The inspectorate.
He took everything too literally.
What, I don't understand?
In what sense?
Well, you know...
Could I have a cigarette?
Of course he had a few worthwhile ideas. safety shoes... a dining hall... but later...
Although judging it today...
...even I... never mind.
After the incident... he went off the deep end.
It happened during his last trip to the field.
He used to make these long trips demonstrating team bricklaying.
It took a lot out of him, so we limited these visits.
If the area was well prepared, he'd go alone.
If not, he took along helpers.
Ever onward young Slavs, onward Greeks and young Spaniards.
Young Chinese join the march from Asia.
Others soon there will join ya...
Negro brothers from Virginia and heroes hurrying from Malaysia.
Listen to this.
Three neighbors from the village, off to work they went.
While two worked, the third laughed with merriment.
Hard work doesn't pay at all, it's time that is misspent.
Lying in a cozy hammock...
is a job for Michalak,
Oh, they did lament...
Oh, they did lament.
This song is about Nowa Huta about Nowa Huta these words.
So simple and pretty and new as lovely as singing of birds.
We're here.
Just a minute...
Whose first?
Start!
Hold it!
Nobody moves!
Get away!
To the clinic!
I'll find whoever did this!
Nobody moves!
Good evening, comrade.
Can't sleep?
I understand.
It's hard to sleep after something like that.
Did they take good care of it?
Put iodine on it?
No.
- They poured water on them.
- Hydrogen peroxide?
We'll check into it.
Does it hurt?
Sure it hurts.
What do you think?
How could a worker do it to another worker?
Don't people understand?
They want houses, but doing it the old way will take a hundred years.
We're cranking up the quotas.
No everyone likes that.
And you... didn't you feel the brick was hot?
- I had gloves on.
- Thick ones, I bet.
- I had gloves on.
- Thick ones, I bet.
Not very.
Had shingles a long time?
I don't really, I just said I did, but I do have eczema.
Eczema?
Let's see your hands!
Well?
Hey, can't you guys take a joke?
Who are you, anyway?
Always tailing us...get lost!
I'm going.
Excuse me.
Good night, comrades.
If you need anything, just call.
Birkut no longer worked in construction.
His health started to fail him.
But he became deeply involved in social issues.
He found housing for workers.
He fought tooth and nail for every one of them.
He fought for months with the housing authorities.
He usually won.
That's when he was happiest and supervised every move.
The people loved him; you could even say they worshipped him.
Mateusz!
Come here a minute...
- What do you think of this?
- I'll go with you.
- You don't have to.
- I want to.
- I'll go and be right back.
- No, you'll just cause trouble.
No, no.
I remember.
All right.
All taken care of.
Yes.
Could you please ask if
I could go in there?
In there?
Of course.
I was surprised you were waiting.
The colonel will gladly see you.
To what do I owe this honor?
Please sit down.
Coffee?
Excuse me... where's the other comrade?
Who?
That bricklayer?
He left.
How?
That's right.
Comrade secretary, did you see the other comrade go out?
I was busy and didn't notice.
But it did seem strange that comrade kept pacing... as if he were waiting for someone.
I was afraid to ask.
Exactly.
I sometimes get so mixed up I don't know what I'm doing.
Well then...
How about a cigarette?
Still in bandages?
Something wrong?
They're festering.
This long?
I got them dirty laying bricks.
It was an urgent job.
Now they're festering.
Strange.
They keep bandaging them and yet they continue to fester.
Where's Witek?
Wincenty Witek, the bricklayer.
We came in together.
What have you done with him?
Comrade Birkut... you haven't had a vacation in a long time.
Why don't you go to the mountains and get some rest?
I'll help you if you have any problems.
Krynica?
How about Zakopane?
You'll regret this!
I'll go wherever I have to!
I'll even go to Warsaw!
You'll get yours, you'll see!
Autumn came...
Autumn came and it rained continuously... but Birkut... kept fighting to free Witek.
He went to all the bureaus... and government offices.
Finally he took a leave and decided... to go to the capitol, even though it wasn't the best moment.
His wife was having a difficult pregnancy.
The overall situation was bad too.
Maybe my letters aren't getting through.
I have to go there.
Wait.
I have to.
Mateusz, don't go.
I must.
- Go home.
- No.
I won't go.
- Go!
- No.
Excuse me...
Could I see you a minute?
This is private, because
I like you.
You don't like me, but I've always liked you.
When you set that record,
I couldn't eat or sleep.
I've made you an example to my son.
I have one son, he has three names:
Jozef, Boleslaw, and Bartlomiej.
- Bartlomiej?
- After my father-in-law.
Since you like me, get lost.
I asked you once already!
I can't, the enemy lurks.
You don't understand and you're causing a lot of trouble.
This is my personal advice... leave it alone, it's a dirty case.
Bullshit!...I know Witek and he's a decent guy.
Decent!
But they call him, Wiktorio.
So what? ...He was in Spain.
Exactly.
Is that bad?
Of course not, but where was he after that?
In France, in a POW camp.
You're young comrade, you don't know how they recruited spies.
All the intelligence services were sniffing around there.
They recruited him, he took his time getting close to you... then they told him to give you the brick.
What brick?
That brick, comrade Birkut!
Hop on, I'll take you home.
Mateusz, the train's leaving!
See you...When I get back, you'll all sing a different tune!
Here's some plum cake.
It came out a little thin...
Take care of yourself.
You've reached high, getting to me.
It's not easy to do.
There are only 24 hours in a day for both of us.
But there's an ideological battle being fought.
So forgive me for being brief...
I'm familiar with your case and
I'll try to clear things up.
But I'm not from Warsaw, I've come from Nowa Huta.
I'd like something definite.
Don't be childish, there's a political war going on in Poland.
Conditions are difficult...
Don't interrupt, I don't have time.
If there's been a mistake made, we'll straighten it out.
It happens sometimes and then we react quickly.
My request of you is, don't do anything on your own.
Trust the people's justice.
- I do trust it, but...
- Nothing on your own.
I know the case.
I'll take care of it.
I've called a special commission.
No one will be mistreated.
And you, comrade Birkut, calmly wait for the result.
PART II
He returned a week later, much grayer.
There was a meeting in the new hall.
He went there straight from the station.
...socialism is able to reach... straight to the human mind by way of example.
We don't want to dominate.
We have friends everywhere.
In millions of workers, farmers and intellectuals...
Let me say something!...Come on!
You're not on the agenda and there's going to be a funny film.
But it's very important!
No...
The text hasn't been approved.
What do you plan to say?
Get away from the mike!
People... this is about comrade Witek...
A good man who they're mistreating!
I've been everywhere!... tried everything, even in Warsaw...
People!...
Onward young workers!
Hard work unites us today!
Join the work brigades!
We'll join our hearts and minds...
A few days later, without telling anyone, I borrowed a bicycle... and went to see the Birkuts.
I knew what had happened.
The scene on the square didn't even surprise me.
Did you need to do that?
I warned you, didn't I?
But it can still be put right... saved... so that everything isn't lost.
Such a comrade, such a lead worker!
Cut yourself off.
Hanka, the keys!
Please...
I'm asking you privately, cut yourself off.
I'm doing everything I can, in my written and oral reports.
I destroyed one denunciation, but how long can I go on?
They're starting to poke through your records.
They're looking.
Let them, I'm clean as a whistle.
No you're not!...Who threw fish at his boss two years ago?
Waiter!
I want to pay!
Don't touch that!
- What's this?
- Money.
It's not enough!
What's this?
Minister...
My coat!
Let's go!
The bricklayer's waltz!
There!
Now we're even.
Are you serious about making... an honest film about those times?
Are you sure?
That's my intention.
Word of honor?
I don't have any secrets.
I'll take the film, please.
- And?
- And shit!
Are you giving it to him?
Relax!
Filming isn't allowed in here.
This is amateur stuff...
The rest is in the archives, shot by a newsreel photographer.
The "Skocznia" case,
I was a witness.
I'll remember that.
Well, it's good-bye then.
Privately, do you think
Witek was guilty?
He was rehabilitated and is now in a very high position.
That's all I'm saying.
Not in there...
What's going on, where have you been, what are you looking for?
Materials.
From strippers?
People are calling...
This wasn't our agreement.
There was someone there...
The hell with him...
That was a bad address, a bad idea, and lack of a concept.
Where have you been going?
You're playing capture the flag...
Warned, they'd have stonewalled.
Nothing came of it anyway!
Besides, this isn't America, these aren't the methods to use...
There's a film.
Exposed.
Zero, a total bust!
You're doing as you please, and I asked you... not to touch that, that it was off-limits...
You can't do whatever you like!
I won't stand for anarchy!
And that idea of mine... the Katowice steelworks and Witek.
He has to be in this film.
It can be arranged.
I've arranged bigger deals.
- I've got to run...
- To Katowice!
I'm sorry, but it's an order.
Please go, he's waiting for you.
Wincenty Witek.
It has to be done, simply, with no surprises...
I have our materials about Birkut.
In the newsreel we're about to see...
...he doesn't even appear.
The other material was stored away from the studio.
I'm glad they let you have it.
I am too.
Where are you sitting?
Roll film, please.
Polish Film Newsreel
Traitors on Trial.
In Warsaw, the trial of the... subversive "Skocznia" gang continues.
The four accused all had a common goal... slowing our country's development.
The Peoples' Republic gave them a chance to work and advance... which they spurned, choosing treason instead.
Socialist construction men, trusted by their fellow workers... they tried to wreck the efforts of an entire nation... by falsifying building plans... and striking out at lead workers.
Today they act remorseful... but yesterday they were ready to ally themselves... even with Guderian's soldiers.
The prosecutor refutes their lies... proving the defendants' links to foreign intelligence.
Here they are: J. Wolodkiewicz, head of the Association.
M. Pawlusiak, supervising inspector.
M. Herc, accountant.
W. Witek, team bricklaying instructor.
This trial is a clear lesson to us all.
We must be ever vigilant.
That was the first day of the trial.
Questioning of the witnesses was later and we shall also show it.
They never did.
We're the first ones to see it.
Thank you, roll the next film.
The witness has testified... not under oath, because he is suspected of activities similar... to those of the accused, W. Witek.
However, he is still obliged to tell the truth.
The witness... is accused of organizing a terrorist group... and attacking the headquarters of public law and order.
What do you say to the accusations?
Does the witness recognize the accused, here in the courtroom?
Yes, I do.
The accused has admitted attempting to cause you bodily harm.
Did the witness know of Witek's plans earlier?
Yes, I did.
I asked if you knew before hand, what he planned to do.
Yes, I did.
I knew about everything.
- Do you understand the question?
- Yes, of course.
I knew about it from the very beginning.
That can't be so.
The witness has testified that he trusted the accused... and that he'd been deceived.
Not at all!
It was a mutual action.
Mutual?
That makes no sense at all.
The accused considered the witness a committed activist.
That's not true.
Our groups worked together.
Lead workers were to be attacked.
So, we chose each other.
Both of us were lead workers, so...
But in your deposition,
I can read it to you... you state something else entirely.
I lied, just like every enemy.
Once I attacked my superior with a fish.
That's right, a little fish.
But during your interrogation, you said something else.
Do you know what goes on there?
Want me to tell you?
I'm with you!
I retract my testimony!
I retract everything!
I take back everything!
Well sweetheart, for that... you've got a small vodka and a large ice cream on me.
Did you want to say something?
Not yet, you know I save it till the end.
Here's your material.
Let's go find Witek.
That won't be hard.
Bigwigs are easy to find.
Leonard... starting today, it's handheld only... using this.
This is great, but when are we landing?
In two minutes, right on schedule.
Look there...
- The center of the mill...
- I'm interested in talking to you.
I know better.
- Please have a look...
- But you don't have time!
We'll talk, don't worry.
Why the 1950s?...Young people are interested in this steel mill.
In 1980 it'll be the most modern steel mill in the world.
Talk to me, I'm begging you.
I'd start from the war in Spain, but what about my childhood?
The personality takes shape between the ages of 3 and 5.
My father was a cobbler...
I want to know about Birkut.
I was getting to him.
I met him in Nowa Huta.
He came from a poor village...
Not then, after prison.
You were released first.
How did you know?
They released Birkut at the end of October...
A welcome-home reception was arranged.
There were people, flowers, an orchestra... and we went to the station.
Is this all?
Where's everyone else?
Is everyone here?
You have to say something...
- It's your turn...
- I've had my fill of speeches.
I'm begging you, the moment demands it!
- Did everyone know about it?
- I announced it...
Go on, tell them the truth!
Comrade Birkut...
Friends...
I thank you very much.
It's late.
We'll never get up; let's go home and go to work tomorrow.
What is it, comrade?
Not a word about mistakes, distortions, the historic moment?
I'll leave that to you.
Comrade Birkut is tired, which is understandable.
Let him regain his strength and he'll help us in our struggle!
Long live comrade Birkut!
Excuse me...
- There aren't any street signs...
- New in town?
We live here... and don't need... street signs.
Is that building C-2?
I don't know, the numbers are the same as in every city.
Are the barracks still standing?
Yes, go straight and then turn left... at the third street, past the flower shop, then straight ahead.
A pack of cigarettes, please.
And some matches.
I thought you knew.
Everyone knows.
I was sure you knew.
I was sure.
I haven't had any contact with her for three years.
Didn't she write to you?
No, and now...
She's with someone?
No, that's not it.
- She probably felt like a fool...
- Why?
Forget her.
I understand how it was then, she was a star athlete...
She wanted it very much, but to go so low...?
The idiot did what they told her.
She denounced you publicly... as a lackey and an enemy.
An enemy and a lackey.
To hell with her, she's no good!
There are plenty of others!
There's a lot of to be done.
We've been waiting for you.
A committee's been formed, and soon a board of directors... let me finish.
You'll be chosen for sure.
You're important here.
I'm leaving, close everything up.
I'm going to find her.
Are you crazy?
At a time like this?
Did he find her?
I don't know, but he never returned to the mill again...
See those three giant loaders over there?
Two others work at the North Port.
Weren't those words about his wife overly harsh?
Maybe.
What was the deal with their marriage?
Why are you so nervous?
Relax, take it easy.
So, tell me about it.
Just between us... in all honesty she never was his wife.
What do you mean?
I saw the newsreels.
Sure, there was even a wedding, but...
You want the truth?
It was like this.
We all went there, along with you guys... a film crew.
The Marriage Bureau was in a village called Mogila.
The guy in charge was old school.
A real stickler!
He asked Hanka for her ID.
She was only sixteen.
So he demanded a court statement.
She didn't have that either.
So he refused to marry them.
He stuck to his guns.
We could use his kind here.
But those were different times.
What to do?
The guy wasn't about to budge.
We're negotiating, arguing, and meanwhile... a thousand people are waiting, trucks and vodka...
It was a tough situation.
Then Jodla, our Party Secretary, had an idea.
He told the official to keep his mouth shut... and us comrades were to not say a word either.
...Warsaw!...The Ministry!
- And that's the way it stayed.
- Do you have Birkut's address?
I looked for him, but with all the work I didn't have time...
Sorry, I have to run.
This is my assistant, they're filmmakers.
We have artists here every day.
I'll see you tonight.
Maybe I'll remember something else.
That piece at the top of the furnace we call "pants".
The furnace "puts them on" before being fired.
We're part of the old guard from Nowa Huta.
All of you were Birkut's friends yet no one knows where he is.
- Do you know his address?
- No, I don't.
But I saw Hanka in Zakopane... you know, his wife.
They were never married.
How do you know that?
I went back a few times, but I never saw her again.
I guess she doesn't live there anymore.
I don't know.
"Stars of a Single Season?"
Not a bad season!
Go in for a close-up.
You're the film crew?
Welcome...
So, you're the one who called?
Your shoes!
I asked you to wipe your feet because the finish is new.
I've prepare a little something...
It took us all night to get here.
How did you ever find me?
It's me you want to interview?
Yes, I've been looking for you for a long time.
What can I do for you?
Though I don't quite understand.
I left sports a long time ago.
Since moving here, I only ski.
That's fine, we're here to talk about Mateusz.
Mateusz Birkut, lead worker.
Your first husband.
They'll set up the camera and we'll chat.
No.
Oh no.
Not about him!
What did you expect to hear?
That's not it.
I'm a woman too.
I just want the facts.
The facts, that's all.
About his arrival here, how it went... how he looked.
I already know a lot about him.
I've gotten it out of people.
All of you owe him something.
He was terribly stubborn.
But he managed to find me here.
And he came.
May I?
On vacation?
No.
Just passing through?
Planning to stay long?
No.
Boss, I need an order of bread, no make it two.
There's a new customer.
I'll be right there.
What do you want?
Tea.
With lemon?
No, thanks.
Is there any plum cake?
We don't serve deserts.
Just tea then.
Nothing?
Tea.
- Boss...
- Just a minute.
Hold on!
- None with sardines?
- I've got sprats though.
- Boss...
- One moment!
I have to leave.
- Don't you feel well?
- No, I'm fine.
- But I just have to.
- Wait another hour.
It'll be too late then.
Who is he?
Nobody.
I'll stay.
Your tea's getting cold!
Sit down.
I'm working.
All right, I'll wait.
Can I get some cake?
Since you want to know, it's all over between us.
It was supposed to be without lemon.
Shall I take it back?
No, I'm not fussy.
Sit down when you have a minute.
That's how I imagined it.
Please don't get upset.
But you did speak later, right?
You must have spoken...
What did he say?
Please tell me.
You should've said so right away!
It's all right, please help yourself.
You don't look like you've been overeating lately.
Go right ahead, it's all for you.
Which do you prefer?
I've never had either of them.
Well then, now you will!
You're like me, you sniff more than you drink.
Hart, kidneys, or liver?
A bit of everything.
- Cigarette?
- I don't smoke anymore.
That's good, healthier.
What do you plan to do?
- That depends.
- On what?
Different things.
- Going back to laying bricks?
- I'd like to, but I can't.
Well then?
I'll find something.
There are lots of building trades.
You and construction!
Why don't you stay here?
- No, we're leaving.
- Too bad.
Leaving's easy, but here she earns three times what a bricklayer does.
We'll make it somehow.
"Somehow."
Listen to me, prior to October,
I was an important executive.
Sure you can leave if you want to.
But why?
Look...
I have money, you have a background.
A great background, solid documents, a name... and, of course, those four years.
I propose a partnership.
What would I do, make sandwiches?
Of course not!
You'd handle matters in government bureaus.
What do you say?
In two years you'll have a car.
In four, a house.
And she'll spend her time gossiping.
Remember, you were a statue and you still are.
But it makes no sense anymore.
The others stopped long ago.
Do you want to be the last?
All right, I'll leave you two alone so you can talk it over.
Come with me.
No.
Why not?
You really are... a huge statue, I'm just a whore.
If we left together... it would only confirm it.
What do you want me to do?
Do whatever you like.
Why don't you lie down...
What the hell is this?
Are you nuts?...Beat it!
Please forgive us.
Thank you very much.
Are you leaving?
I see I'm too late.
- Did it go well?
- Your standard drinks.
- How did you know?
- Filmmakers know everything.
Well, well...
Just look at you!
Drunk again!
What do you think this is, America?
You know what the situation is.
Hanka, excuse me, could
I have his address?
Your son's.
Leave Maciek alone.
A nightmare.
This architecture.
From the 1950s.
Do you like it?
- I grew up with it.
- I see.
Wide streets. lots of greenery, simpler people.
I remember... trips into Krakow.
In rubber boots... and blue work jackets.
Mr. Jodla...
Krakow and Nowa Huta have different buildings, are different cities.
What's your opinion?
If it were up to me, I'd leave the following in Krakow... the Old Market Square and the old
Cloth Hall as reminders.
The rest would be nice apartment buildings.
There's lots of space in Nowa Huta.
Krakow is crowded and cramped.
People jostle each other in the streets...
Would you like to see a film about Birkut?
I'm making a film about him.
How is he doing?
I could've made a name for myself too...
The film's going to be about those times.
The period when Nowa Huta was being built.
Are you looking for sensation?
Was the work competition bad?
It's not about that...
Wait, do you see this city?
We built all of this.
Nowa Huta, June 18, 1976.
Wrap it up.
Thank you.
Is that everything?
Of the films, yes.
We've still got... magnetic tapes.
Very... interesting.
- Where's the director?
- Out in the hallway.
That material's nothing.
It's not convincing.
It'll never be edited.
You can't do this.
A little bit of patience.
A debut is always risky...
Please trust me on this one.
The film will be fine.
It's an important film.
Magnetic tapes?!
What the hell is this, radio?
What could I do?
I told you to watch her.
Please be quiet.
I'm working here and I not only cut and splice, I also think.
Not the way you ought to.
Why? ...She's a bright girl and her material is good.
Very good.
I saw your work.
And?
Interesting.
Is that all?
It's a bit thin, though.
Where's Birkut?
There wasn't time...
- Haven't you found him yet?
- Not yet.
About Birkut, without Birkut???
What about his son?
I'll find both of them.
The film will be great.
I'll be honest with you.
You've exceeded your limits.
We support young artists, but we're not a charity.
No more film or cameras.
Are you nuts?
How am I going to finish it?
We'll make two stories for the evening news out of it.
What? !
What the hell are you talking about?
It's great material!
This is do or die for me!
But not for me.
I have two programs every day.
The audience can't start taking me for granted.
And now they respect you?
Two weeks for sound and editing!
I must make this film and you have to help me!
I've already given materials, public money...
Let's make a deal.
OK, you turn in the cameras and materials... and we're square!
They took my film from me.
Oh God!...Why?
No more film, no more cameras.
And I have some great material.
Let's have a look at it.
I didn't find it earlier.
It's never been shown.
Roll film, please.
People have never sung this song at a public rally before.
An interview with Mateusz Birkut.
Mateusz, we're from Polish Newsreel and we'd like to ask...
Another circus?
We're just doing our jobs.
What is it?
Your village suffered greatly under the distortions of socialism.
The people still bear a grudge.
They'll vote only if you do so.
I know, that's why I'm here.
Out of necessity.
Where's the election commission?
Neighbors, it was a dumb idea, but it's too late now.
You suffered so much injustice.
Are you going to vote?
We're waiting.
People... there've been good times and bad times... but it's our country.
Comrades...
Maciek!
We were looking for young Birkut, but his name's Tomczyk.
Please send this material to my editing room.
We've been ordered to hold it.
Maybe you botched it.
Well?
It's not finished.
Maybe you lied a little.
You know, in films...
No, dad.
Maybe it was boring.
Was it honest?
Yes.
Then they have to allow it.
No they don't.
Why not?
Why not?
They don't want this film.
They approved it and now don't want it?
Not any more.
But they invested money...
But not for this.
I don't get it, didn't they ask what it was for? ...Strange people.
They got scared.
Of what?
Everything.
Nobody's afraid of everything.
If you're afraid, it's of one thing.
What is it?
I don't know.
Then find out.
How?
Find that Birkut of yours.
They took away my cameras and film.
And without those you can't do it?
What for?
If they were making a film about me, I'd expect a visit.
That's normal.
Well?
Are you just going to lie there?
I'll eventually get up.
Grab your shoes and bag.
What for?
I've already told you.
If the film was about me...
Go find him and talk to him.
- Then come back and tell me.
- Tell you?
That's right.
Do you have to tell everyone?
I want to know how it ended.
Go on.
You've got a bus in half an hour.
I've made a cherry liqueur.
It'll be ready soon.
- We'll have a drink.
- I don't drink.
Well, since it's with cherries...
- Is Tadek still in the army?
- He was just sworn in.
- Did you go?
- Sure.
It was nice.
Tadek's really grown up.
I went to mom's grave.
Nice flowers you planted.
- You getting married?
- What for?
I'm the only one you can be honest with.
Wait a minute...
Buy yourself some new clothes.
You'll never find a guy in those.
THE LENIN SHIPYARDS - GDANSK
Excuse me, Mr. Tomczyk?
That's right.
What is it?
You're Mateusz Birkut's son?
Yes, so what?
I'm looking for your father.
I've making a film about him.
You?
That's not important now.
I'd just like to meet him... and talk to him.
What is it you want?
Your father's address.
He's dead.
Excuse me...
I knew you wouldn't get lost!

How much for this wench and sucker?
She ought to be worth 650.
That's too much.
I can't get more than seven for them in new orleans.
Shuck down your pants.
Bend over.
You're wasting time.
He ain't got hemorrhoids.
You alter some of them?
My pa never altered a nigger,

I wouldn't be blaming them.

Well, I'm right charmed my own self.
Mr. Brownlee is a trader.
Well, you gonna have slaves,
You got to have traders.
That's right.
You can't eat them,
And you can't plow them under.
Papa. Papa, doc redfield come about big pearl.
Well, you know...
If she has vomit or temperature,
She got to be isolated.
No, doc redfield, nothing like that.
Well, let's see.
All right, now, pearl, breathe deep.
Git! Git!
What ails her, doc?
Doc redfield's the best veterinarian anywhere around here.

Oh.
Well, I reckon.
But you can't never be sure
About a black wench. lucy?
She pure.
I've been saving her
Like master maxwell tell me.

You don't let just any buck get to her.
Hmm.
Big pearl, you the only one
Who can tell us most certain.
Mm-hmm.
Well...
Nothing ailing the wench-
Except she cravin'-
In the bud of heat.
She's hipped, plum hipped.
Old doc redfield-
Nothing he don't know
About nigger nature, nigger symptoms.
Hammond, son...
You pleasure her, she'll get better.
You don't...
She'll fall off.
I too black, master, sir.

Master's duty
To pleasure the wenches first time,
You know that.
Oh.
Pure mandingo.
You got bucks, too?
I'd give s3,000 for a mandingo buck.
Need one to breed her.
When I was your age, hammond,
There wasn't no
14-year-old virgins
Around falconhurst.
Hammond craves the bright-skinned ones.
Why ever you don't hanker for big pearl.
I do hanker, papa, it's...
She's powerful musky is all.
No need for musk to bother you.
Just soak them good
In manganade and potash water.
I need some more milk.
Yes, sir, master.
Agamemnon, you black scoundrel,
Get in here, help lucrezia borgia.
Tell them how many suckers you brung us, lucrezia borgia.

These twins...

She bred out now-
Too old.
Yes, sir, massa.
I'm calling you, mem.
I'm begging you to step face.
Papa, don't get yourself riled now.
It ain't good for your rheumatism.
I'll get master hammond
To take a piece of your hide off of you.
Oh, no, massa, don't hide me.
Please, sir.
I-I be spry.
Do you have any religion
For your niggers, mr. Maxwell?
Hell, no.
More religions they gets, the ornerier they gets.
Harder to drive.
Don't worry none about their immortal souls?
They ain't got no immortal souls.
They gets to thinking they has souls.
They gets to thinking
They's as good as white folk.
Mem, you reckon you got a soul?
Well, a lazy, no-account,
Stupid, god-forsaken nigger like me
Can't have a soul, massa.
Well, some folks think they got souls
And go to heaven, too.
Them abolitionists up north done say they's good as whites.
Damn sons of bitches.
Slavery was ordained by god-
By god hisself.
Niggers are right happy eating, working,
Fornicating...
Abolitionists!
Cracks and loonies!
Papa, papa.
Interfering in other folks' business!
Papa, your rheumatism.
I don't give a damn about my rheumatism!
Don't do this, don't do that!
Gets worse, whatever I do or quit doing!
Uh, sleeping...
With one of them naked mexican dogs...
They say it drains the rheumatism
Right out of the man
And into the dog.
Yes?
A nigger just as good.
One of them drain off the rheumatism good as any naked dog.
'course, you'd have to have that nigger
Sort of curled up around your feet,
And then you got to press hard
And kindly force the rheumatism right out the soles.
That's right interesting.
Hmm.
Papa, I'm going.
Lucrezia borgia,
You tell lucy to get big pearl ready.
Right glad to hear that, son.
Good boy.
He look like he be a right vigorous stud.
He's...
Shy about his leg.
When he was 6 years old, a year after his ma died,
A pony threw him off,
Stepped on his knee.
Now, just do everything he say.
Everything.
And don't let no farts,
No difference how you feel.
And don't forget to say thank you,
Whether he gives you nothing or not.
You supposed to reckon it's a prideful hour-
White master taking your first.
This stuff smells awful, mama.
Smells good to white noses.
You know, I...

Hush up, now.

Toby, you get out of here.
How you all feel-
Laying here chained
While the white man walk about,
Doing his pleasure with a black girl?
May actually don't have no feelings at all-
Like that peckerwood say.
Feelings like some old dumb animal
That don't count no how.
Y'all hear me?
In africa,
Our people born free.
That's right.
Free men...
Not slaves.
Masters of our own selves.
And of the forest
And the rivers and the mountains.
Y'all think that deep down,
That peckerwood don't know
We's as human as he is?
What for, you reckon,
He keep us from learning
And religion
And reading?
'cause they know.
They's a-feared that deep down we is human.
Mem...
You brung that copy-out page?
Yeah, I got it.
Show these brethren how to read.
"oh, lord...
"our god...
"others, lord...
"beside thee...
"have...

Dumerdo?

Let me see what you got there.

And write.
Who learned you, mem?

Reading! You know what you can get for reading?
Go on!
There we go.
Ahh.

O.K.
You got to keep your feet
Pressed hard on his belly now,
So the rheumatism drains right out from the sole, all right?
Yes. Yes, doctor.
All right.
Hammond.
Doc.
Well, good night all.
I'll do that, lucrezia.
You stay curled up there, boy.
Good night, doc.
Good night.
Papa, I got to peel mem's rump.
What's he done?
Well, he-
He's just been getting too uppity is all.
You protecting him again?
What'd he do now?
Papa, I catch mem reading.
He can read.
Reading!
That dumb-ass, broke-head, nigger read-
I don't want to see!
You know what old sam tucks do with readin' niggers?
Puts out an eye.
Cures them good.
One eye, not two.
Blind, there's no damn use,
But one eyes work as hard-
Don't give no more trouble.
No, papa, no.
I'll just whup him a bit is all.
'taint enough.
That's all, papa.
A larruping will do it.
Then whup him fierce.
Hammond, you got to cut deep,
'cause a nigger don't feel physical punishment soon as a white man.
And you rub in the pimentade after.
Hurts like hell,
But heals the scars right clean.
And tell lucrezia borgia to use fresh red pepper in the pimentade,
Fresh lemon, and plenty of salt.
Yes, sir.
Good night, papa.
Plenty of salt,
I say.
Yes, sir.
Reading.
You pray for memnon tonight, massa?
Ain't no use me praying for you,
Seeing as how
You can do it for your own self.
May after tomorrow-
After you been whupped.
Now, git.
Yes, sir, massa.
Master, sir?
What you want, dite?
Master, I knocked up.
Oh, I been looking for that.
Master, when my sucker come,
Can'st I keep it?
It's for your own good, dite.
So you won't feel bad if'n we go to sell it.
Now, I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake,
Pray the lord my soul to take.
Haul him up, pokey.
Please.
Don't want a beating.
Master hammond, please.
No, please!
No, please, stop!
Please.
Please, massa hammond.

Shut your mouth, meg.
Now...
Stand off from him-
So like-
And aim for his bottom.
You get him in the legs it don't hurt him none,
But don't you slam his back.
Yes, sir, master.
Go ahead.
You ain't doing that right.
Give me that.
Now, this is how you do it.
Who the hell are you to touch my niggers?
Why, cousin hammond.
Don't you recognize me?
We was little ones.
I'm charles.
Major woodford's son from crowfoot plantation.
Cousin charles.
Come up to the house.
Oh. Master's misery drain right through my belly.
You lie, little buck.
I still feel my rheumatism. Here.
I hurt awful.
Get down there.
Ahh.
Where's charles?
He's a-stuffin' himself
With lucrezia borgia's vittles.
Uh-huh.
Major woodford-
Charles' pa-
Is bad pressed.
Charles come with a letter from him
Asking to borrow money.
Do you have a mind to?
May help.
If'n you take to charles' little sister,
Cousin blanche.
Oh, papa, are you starting that again?
It's time for us to be a-thinkin'
Of an heir for falconhurst.
You need a white lady to give you a son with human blood-
Not them suckers of yours through wenches.
Pa, I wouldn't know what to do,
Not with no white lady.
And you can't have no more wenches if'n you marry.
Of course. Have them just the same.
You doesn't talk about them in front of your wife,
But she knows you have them.
She wants you should have them.
Saves her from having to submit.
When she do submit, though,
You keep on your shirt and drawers.
Plagues a white lady almost to death to see a man naked.
Not in new orleans.
Huh?
Them white ladies there,
I hear...
They strip it all off.
Every bit.
Ham...
You just go take a look at cousin blanche.
If she ain't to your taste,
We can look around at other white ladies.
Major woodford-
Ha ha ha-
Don't get the money.
Hello, sir.
My name's hammond maxwell.
I'm warren maxwell's son.
Hammond maxwell, well, if it ain't.
How's your pa?
Oh, he's all crippled up with the rheumatism.
Oh, that's too bad.
And this here is charles woodford,
Major woodford's son from crowfoot.
Pleased to meet you.
The pleasure's all mine, sir.
Make yourself welcome, mr. Woodford.
Y'all come on in.
Thank you much.
Tell me, does warren still have
That wench and that child?
Thank you, sir.
Little one ought to be big enough to breed by now.
Well, that's what
I come here for, sir.
You got an old mandingo buck.
My papa craves to borrow him that buck to breed them two wenches.
But I haven't got that buck anymore.
He dead.
Bull gored him about three months ago,
And old zucks, he died.
Damn. I'm sorry to hear that, sir.
My papa laid store in him.
Warren maxwell and his mandingos.
They make the best fighting niggers,
Mandingos.
I crave one for my own self.
A fine one.
One that can whup anybody.
This is katie and ellen.
I hope they'll be to your likin'.
Suit me fine.
Good night, then.
Thank you.
Good night.
You a virgin?
This one ain't, huh, katie?
Cousin hammond, you take the virgin.
I don't care for hard work.
Cousin charles, what the hell you doing
Kissing her on the mouth?
What are you doing that for?
Why, it makes a man feel good.
She likes it, too, don't you, pretty wench?
Yes, master.
You don't like what charles is doing?
No, master.
I don't like it, neither.
Damn, it makes me sick.
Why are you looking odd-like at me?
Sneaky-like?
What for?
You tell me now, no fibbing.
You tell me, is it my leg?
No, master.
J-just you strange for a white man.
How do you mean strange?
Caring what a white man do to a wench.
Can you help me off with these boots?
Yes, sir.
What happened to your leg, master?
No one's ever asked that straight out honest.
You know, they're always pretending they don't see.
Ha.
I do walk bad.
I thinks you walks just fine, master.
Raise your head.
Raise your head.
Now you're looking away from me.
I can't see you.
Put your eyes on me.
Look at me straight into my eyes.
I can't, master.
I craves you to do it, ellen.
Niggers don't-
Don't what?
Look a white man in the eyes?
If you're told to do it...
If asked to do it,
You can do it.
Ellen?
Don't you be afeard.
If you don't like me, you don't have to stay.
I like you, sir.
I want to please you.
Here we have a capital woman and her three children.
All in good health.
What will you say for them?
Give me an offer.
I'll put the whole lot up for $850.
They ain't worth it.
Come on, let's get out of here.
610 to the gentleman in green. Do I hear 615?
Look at this lovely wench, gentlemen.
I got a mandingo.
Pure-bred mandingo.
I want to see.
This is what I was looking for, ja.
Ooh!
Playful as a kitten,
Strong as a bull elephant.
Good lord, ma'am.
I don't buy the pig in the poke.
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
She carry on like a man.
Is she buys him,
He's going to find out tonight she ain't no man.
Hey, you mean that lady will pleasure with that nigger?
That's a german widow,
And german ladies can never pleasure without them.
How much?
I give you 3,000.
I'll pay the price you're asking.
You're no gentleman,
Trying to take the nigger from the poor widow woman.
If you should crave the make of him, ma'am.
I ain't letting you get him.
I'll pay more,
500 more.
Schweinhund!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Done! You got a good boy.
Trustworthy, obedient, whip smart.
I sure hate to sell him.
What do you call him?
Mede, or galamede.
I'll come fetch him in two, three days.
Hey, I got me a fighting nigger!
Never been beaten up.
The mandingo my papa's craved all his life.
Yes, sir, ain't he something. Hee hee.
Mede, huh?
Mede. That's a good name, mede.
Mede, huh?
Damn.
Beatrix, my dear,
Ain't cousin hammond the image of uncle theopolis?
Uncle theopolis weren't that handsome,
And uncle theopolis never looked at blanche like that.
Blanche, do you think cousin hammond is handsome?
It don't matter if'n blanche thinks he's handsome.
What matters is cousin hammond thinking blanche is pretty.
You see, you don't get the money
If'n she ain't to his taste and he don't wed her.
Oh, charles.
I heard your pa.
Oh, my god!
Oh, that's all right.
You ain't a wedding that hammond.
Oh, yes, I am.
I'll be a wedding him.
He's a fine catch.
Good-looking,
Rich,
Romantic,
Been to new orleans.
Come from far away.
I'll tell him.
I'll tell him what we done.
He won't believe you,
And papa would throw you out.
Charles, I'm gettin' out of this house...
And this family.
Cousin blanche.
Cousin blanche, wait.
You come to buy me?
Take a good look at me, like I was a wench.
Now, cousin blanche, don't-
Am I to your taste?
You crave I undress?
Cousin blanche, I'm-
I'm terrible sorry.
Well...
I do believe you are.
Can I carry you to church, cousin blanche?
Oh. A gentleman carries a young lady to church,
Everyone reckons they's gonna get married.
May hap we is.
Is what?
May hap we is gonna get married.
How you like to?
You got a nice plantation?
A big house?
Well, the house ain't fine like crowfoot.
It's good enough for just papa and me, but...
But I can build a house.
I just been waitin' till I get married to build a house,
A-a fine house.
Well, now,
I ain't, uh,
I ain't really thought about gettin' married much.
Papa, he say I got to get married and sire me a son.
Is you all proposin'?
Yes, ma'am,
I reckon so.
I-I don't know no other way to do it.
How you like to?
Don't kiss me yet,
Unless it's just a cousin kiss.
Ha!
Well, do you think the yellow
Or the pink is more prettier
On the new mrs. Maxwell?
Oh, ham,
I'm so happy.
Oh, and my ring...
I loves it.
It's much prettier than mama's.
Ha ha ha ha.
Oh. You like it when you kiss me?
Oh, I do. I do.
I crave you to do it.
Hammond...
What we do now?
Well, I don't rightly know.
I mean, with a wench I'd know,
But with a white lady...Ha ha.
I reckon we got to take off some clothing.
Not everything, of course.
Ha ha ha ha.
All right.
What? Let's see...
Well, undo this.
Oh, yeah, I see.
Ha ha.
What for you get up?
I can't sleep seeing, like, when I'm thinkin'.
What you thinkin' about?
I'm thinkin',
I'm wonderin'...
What man you had before me.
Hammond, where'd you get that zany notion from?
You thinkin' I don't know a virgin when I sleeps with one
And pleasures?
I was, too, a virgin.
You was once, but not last night.
Oh! Oh, how can you think such a thing?
There was nobody!
I was pure...
Till you.
You might as well tell me who he is.
I kill the son of a bitch!
Now, you tell me who pleasured you before me!
You-you're accusin' me...
You accusin' me of somethin' I never done.
I never done it!
I never, never, never done it!
I never, never, never-
You disgust me!
Oh! Hammond!
Ah, chéri, all is well?
Very well, madame caroline.
Bon. Bring two.
Your father has been unfaithful to me.
He was one of my best customers,
Till a couple of years ago.
I told you your pa was a hell-raiser.
Yeah. Ha ha.
For warren maxwell's charming son,
Tonight is compliments of the house. Ha ha.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.
You lucky bastard.
I never got it free in my whole life.
Never will, either, probably. Ha ha.
Hell, I don't care.
If I don't have it for six months, it's one more than your widow.
I'm gonna spend my money-ohh!
Look at this gal.
That's it, walk all over me, honey.
You'll get a cramp now.
Why, I've been serving pleasure to old men all day.
But I've been watching your baby face ever since you came in,
Wondering how I was going to get to you.
I ain't feeling good, lady.
Oh, well, I can fix that, honey,
All over. Mmm!
Hey, you do that all over stuff?
Oh, for somebody like him, mmm!
I reckon not, lady.
I...
I'm on my honeymoon.
Oh, well, that's when a gentleman needs good lovin' the most.
He's got the prettiest little peach for a bride
Back at the hotel, just waitin' there, layin' there.
Oh, but I can show him things
His bride don't dream they do it on mars
Where they got creatures with...
6 arms and 12 mouths.
I reckon not, lady.
Maybe another time, all right.
Well, if he ain't goin' with you, I am.
Oh, come on.
What you doin' in here?
Master hammond told me to wait here for him.
Niggers aren't allowed inside.
You a nigger.
I'm madame caroline's slave, and I'm telling you to get out.
I'm master hammond's slave, and I'm staying.
I said get out.
I said I'm staying.
I said get out!
Aah!
Stop it, armand! I have you whipped to death!
Stop them! Stop them!
Mede! Mede, stop that,
I tell you! Stop it!
No, no, let them fight.
$1,000 to the owner of the winner.
Ohh!
Ohh!
$1,000 for you, madame caroline,
If your man wins.
500. 500, I bet.
Get up! Get up!
Get up!
I proclaim mede the victor.
God damn, mede!
Damn! Good boy!
That was damn pretty.
Hey, you hurtin'?
I'm fine, master.
Just fine.
Come on, come on over here.
Wash your face off, sit down. Come on.
Monsieur.
Your winnings, monsieur.
Ha ha ha ha.
Whatever you paid for him,
I'll double it.
Hell, I paid
$4,500 for him.
No, sir.
No, sir, he ain't for sale.
Come on.
Then he must fight my man-topaz.
In two months, perhaps three.
Here.
All right.
Whoa. Whoa.
What for are we stoppin' here?
The horse be tired.
Mede, you get him some water.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Brownlee come by.
Got a nigger he only wants to sell me-cicero.
Oh, yes, sir. He's a troublemaker, sir.
I don't mind that kind.
I like to tame them.
Too many nigger risings are happening.
Virginia, the carolinas,
Especially georgia.
Folks still talk about that nat turner
And abolitionist comin' down here
With that liberator newspaper, I guess,
Is puttin' ideas in their head. Ellen!
Ellen! Yeah,
I'm talkin' to you.
Come here!
Mr. Hammond craves to buy you.
You want to go with him?
Get your bundle.
Who's the wench?
Slave I bought some time back.
She for the mandingo?
She ain't.
Here's falconhurst.
This it?
This is it.
Oh, now, my papa, we mustn't tell him nothin'.
O.K., hammond,
I swear I won't.
You hear me?
He never got to know you weren't pure.
Bust his heart.
Bust it right open
Thinkin' of falconhurst going to a son of a-
Hell, we all married.
Ain't nothin' we can do about it.
Whoa! Whoa!
Hello.
And this is the new missus.
Oh, well, ain't she pretty?
Oh.
Oh.
You know...Ha ha ha.
You know, ever since your ma died,
I've been wantin' another pretty white mistress,
And-and-and now
I got me one.
Papa, this is cousin blanche.
She's your daughter now, papa.
We're married and everything.
Welcome home to falconhurst, my dear.
It ain't fine ahead like crowfoot,
But it's right comfortin'. Come inside. joshua, come hold this horse.
Mandingo.
You brought home a mandingo.
Later, papa.
You can see him later.
Ha. A bride and a mandingo. Ha.
What are you doing?
Don't touch that.
Leave that alone.
Go unpack the dresses.
Where's she sleepin'?
Wherever you like, with a bed.
Oh, no, not in here.
We ain't gonna do nothin' this evening.
Ain't you sleepin' here?
You content to have your wife cryin' all night long?
What's your papa gonna think?
He and ma had separate rooms.
Won't make him think we ain't happy together.
Well, I'll tell him.
Tense!
You step outside for a second.
Go on, go on!
What you gonna tell him?
That you had someone 'fore me?
You decides to say who pleasured you 'fore me,
I just might treat you a bit better.
I might.
You goin' to that wench of yours-ellen?
What you doin' in here?
What you doin'?
You just get out, you hear me?
I don't want you sleepin' in here.
Oooee!
Heaven be praised.
You sure he pure?
I don't want no half.
Oh, yes, sir.
I got the papers right here.
Mede.
What happened to him?
Oh, he fought...
And won.
I'm going to fight him again as soon as I get him trained.
He look ruined.
His testicles, they ain't been teared out?
No, sir, he's fine.
He's so big, he'd tear the wenches.
Little bacon rind gonna fix that.
Lucrezia borgia.
You saved for big pearl.
Might as well put 'em together right away.
But, pa. Uh, no, pa.
But, now...
Mede's still tired out.
He's hurtin'.
I ain't tired, massa.
I'm ready.
He say you tired, you tired.
Don't dispute.
Lucrezia borgia, you take him in the kitchen
And fill him up right good.
And make him swallow down about half a dozen raw eggs.
Oh, I'll make him swallow those eggs.
They'll choke him silly.
Pa?
Papa?
This worries me.
Oh.
I see what's botherin' you.
The papers say this mede's the brother of big pearl's.
Lucy's his ma.
They don't know nothin'.
Mede was a sucker when he was sold.
Papa, that'll be incest.
Works supperin' with animals, works fine with niggers.
Yeah, but what you gonna do then
If the sucker turn out to be some kind of monster?
Snuff it out.
You got to get certain ideas out of your head.
How much you pay for her?
Oh. 1,500.
1,500 for a wench.
Not bad. She was there, and I boughten her.
She's gonna be my bed wench.
Blanche ain't gonna like that.
Well, now, you said yourself
White ladies don't like too much pesterin'.
White ladies don't like their husband gettin' tender
With a wench, neither.
Go on, in you get.
Come on, chuck down those pants.
Get in there.
Ahh!
Sss!
It hot, massa.
Get down in there!
Come on!
Papa, that rind awful hot.
Got to be to toughen his hide.
You reckon you could soften him instead?
It's all right.
Just so it ain't burnin' or scaldin'.
Them old romans always salted their fightin' slaves.
Can't stand it, massa hammond!
It hurt!
You stay there!
You got skin like a sucker.
Any champeen buck'd tear you up.
Damn.
Aah!
Uhh!
Get him on his back!
Come on! Get him on his back!
Come on, kick him again!
Come on, mede!
Get on top of him!
Man! Come on!
Get him!
Get him!
Turn his head, mede!
Get your arms around him! Pull him down!
Come on, flip him over!
Go ahead, man, throw the water.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Aah!
Aah!
Damn, you a lucky buck, able to fight like that.
Go on, get out of here!
Go on!
That right pretty, mede. You comin' along good.
Thank you, sir.
That's right. You're gonna make a good fighter.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
You wipe him off and tell lucy and lucrezia borgia
To rub him down good.
Yes, sir, master hammond.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, you're gettin' good, mede.
You're gettin' to be a better 'n' better white man's fightin' animal.
When they gonna teach you how to growl, grunt,
'n' maul?
Whoop! Whoop! Uh!
When you gonna learn the color of your skin, mede?
Just as soon...
As you stop puttin' on your smilin' nigger face...
For massa hammond.
You drink them toddies like an old drunk.
Blanche ain't settled down here yet,
And you ain't helpin' her ignorin' her.
And I thank you, papa warren.
Now, how that fightin' buck do?
Hell, papa, he'd have broke that bonkin's neck.
He flipped him so high- is that all you can talk about?
Your niggers!
That's all you ever talk about!
Well, I'm gonna tell you somethin'.
My pa-
Hell, your pa's bust!
Go after her, hammond.
She your wife.
Go on, I say.
Ohhh...
My head.
My head's spinnin' around...
And around.
Just drunk.
No.
Hammond...
The reason...
The reason I took that toddy...
Was to get up the courage to say to you...
What I'm a-sayin'...
What I'm a-feelin'...
You ain't touched me...
You want to be with me?
Huh?
You ain't touched me.
I want you to touch me.
Please, hammond.
I need you.
Huh?
Touch me.
Oh, please touch me!
Uhh!
You sure are a strange kind of white lady.
Time I was a little 'un...
Lucrezia borgia used to fan me to sleep.
Lucrezia borgia say I knocked.
She say I been missin' my time of month.
Hell, what she know?
She got 24 suckers.
They kinda itch, like, and ache a little.
Mayhaps, she is right.
Now you won't be wantin' me no more.
You'll be sellin' me again.
Oh, ellen, honey, now, I ain't never gonna sell you.
You're mine.
You ain't mad.
No.
This how mad I be.
You be gonna sell our sucker?
No, I ain't.
No, I won't do that neither, ellen.
But you're gonna sell dotty's sucker.
Now, now, that's different.
Our sucker, we...
We keep him,
Raise him right here at falconhurst.
Ha ha.
That make you glad?
Ha ha. Good.
Hammond...
Hammond, can I ask you somethin'?
Mm-hmm.
When our sucker growed up, can he go free?
Can you give him his freedom?
You crazy to be free?
Is you crazy to be free?
No.
Well, then what for you want the sucker to go free?
'cause for a buck...
For a boy child,
A lot of misery don't happen to him.
He don't get whupped when the master wants to whup him.
He don't get penned on a patch of land like a pig...
Can't never go nowhere or do nothin'.
Can't learn to read or write lessen he get beat or killed.
Hammond.
Uhh!
Forget about it.
I damn right gonna forget about it.
Ellen.
It mean that much to you...
Oh, ellen, honey, all right.
All right, honey.
The sucker can go free.
I promise you.
The sucker can go free.
Nigger-risin', maxwell!
That nigger of yours- cicero-stole a gun from me and run off.
Got some others to join.
We ain't seen them here, birch.

Peckerwood'll kill me!
Be like you killin' me!
You be puttin' the rope around my neck yourself.
What you think you is, a hound dog?
Peckerwood say go fetch, you fetch.
You see me hang, you're gonna know...
You're gonna know you kill a black brother!
Uhh!

Mayhaps I could've got away, or be for you catchin' me.
You 'member that.
You 'member that all day.
You killed me.
You 'member that.
You killed me.
Because, like, you just proved what the peckerwood say-
We're just beasts, willin' to do anything,
Kill each other.
No mind.
No feelin'.
Shut up, nigger!
Uhh! Leastwise,
I ain't gonna die like you gonna die-
Like a slave!
I ain't givin' no lifetime of misery and sweat
To this peckerwood!
I'd rather die than be a slave!
You peckerwood!
That's right!
You peckerwood was oppressed in your own land!
We was free, and you brought us here...
In chain.
Well, now we're here...
And you just better know-
This is just as much our land as it is yourn.
And after you hang me...
Kiss my ass.
Hyah!
Hoo!

You're actin' zany!
Zany!
You behave like a georgia bitch!
And look at yourself in the mirror!
Ain't you got no pride?
You lookin' like this,
Anyone should attract a man more than you!
Comb up your hair!
Comb up your hair,

That's better.
Hammond!

A man craves to pleasure his wife, time to time.
Well, they do dirty things.
They ain't got no shame.
Then you're gonna do dirty things,
Just so you get him in your bed and keep him there.
Why for you two don't act like real husband and wife, I don't know.

Yes! There.

Don't you fret now, hammond.
My wife'll bring her through safe and sound.
She's gifted that way.
Redfield!
In here, help me a second.
Well, excuse me.
It seems
I'll be needed.
Did it come yet?
It come. It come.
And it ain't white.
What are we gonna do?
Well, what we'll do is we'll just...
Untie the cord and let it bleed to death.
Put it in the crib.
Stand off.
That be it.
It's done.
Uh...No...
No...No...
Don't upset yourself.
Oh, no,
It's all right.
Please!
Lucrezia,
Please say it's not black.
Please say...
Please say it's not black!
Please, please, lucrezia.
Well, it come.
Dead.

Damn.
Not yet, ham.
It all messed up.
You don't want to see it now.
No...
Ohh...

To kill old niggers can't work no more...
You got some?
In my carriage.
Get it.
Lucrezia borgia?
Lucrezia borgia? yes, massa.
Get down here.
Lucrezia borgia, you've known about this
And not telling?
I don't mindin' no white folks doin' it,
But that white lady know what she crave.
Miss blanche never craved that black ape.
Then what for she sent for him
The second and third time?
You're lyin', damn it, you liar!
Four times in all, while you was away.
You get.
You stay in the house.
Keep that jabberin' mouth
Of yours shut.
Do you suppose she could be lyin'?
Most likely were rape.
She is scared to tell...
Here, you sit up, all right?
There you are.
Mrs. Redfield.
She done taken the baby away.
Here, drink this.
Hammond,
I only done it
'cause of you and ellen.
Good.
Hammond...
Here, you rest now.
You just lie there and rest.
Hammond.
Hammond!
Hammond, don't do it.
Ain't no other way.
Hammond!
If you kill him, are you gonna be satisfied?
I don't know.
He didn't mean nothin' bad.
Please, hammond, don't do it!
Don't you tell me what to do.
Don't you think you get in my bed,
You anything but a nigger.
Now get out of my way.
You fill a big kettle with water
And strike a fire under it.
That's enough.
Get in.
Get in!
No, massa.
God damn!
Get in there!
Massa hammond...
You can't know...
Don't know what happened.
You-you know
I never do nothin' against you, massa.
I always respect you.
I done think
You was somehow better than a white man.
Uhh...
But you is...
Just white.
Gaa!
Ahh...
Ahh!
Ahh!
No!
No, master, no!
You're a goddamned fool, mem.
Hammond!
Put it down, mem.
No, massa, no.
No, massa...
No, don't come any further, massa, don't...
Put it down!
Don't come any closer, massa,
Please!
You crazy nigger!
Drop that gun,
You loony black bastard!
Papa!
Papa!
Papa! lord, have mercy on me
I don't understand and I don't know the plan well,
I don't understand
I don't know the plan well, I just keep on livin'
I just keep on livin' in the shade
I was born in this time to never be free well, I was born in this time to never be free well, all my time for freedom now is way up in heaven
Lager.
Interested in a run of the cards?
Nothing against it.
Penny poker, nickel on a pair.
Nothing like music to help you forget your troubles.
He's out of tune.
Poor old scut, can't tell the difference.
He's deaf as a post since a load of coal fell on him in '56.
You visiting here?
- I'm looking for a job.
- Tens.
- In the mines?
- Right.
From your hands,
I'd say you've never dug coal.
- Right again.
- Tens bets a nickel.
- It's mine. Won the nickel.
- Beats me.
It's your deal.
It's terrible hard work down there.
Not the sort of work a man generally comes seeking with hands like yours.
They're the only hands I've got.
You're cheating.
You're cheating.
- You're mistaken.
- I saw you, too.
Dealing from the bottom of the deck.
- I'd have dealt myself a better hand.
- You cheated.
There's no need for the false accusations if it's a brawl you want.
Which one of you do I get?
Sorry I had to hit you so hard.
It was important to make it look real.
More sympathy for you.
Easier for them to accept you.
Nothing personal.
Well, you've made a good start.
The fight was a clever idea.
They'll respect you now.
About all they do respect around here is a blow and a hard head.
This gang is crazy, McParlan.
They lost a strike, think they can win with gunpowder.
That's not crazy, it's only Irish.
I don't find it amusing.
Well...
...you're Welsh, Captain.
Now, we know there is an organisation, the Ancient Order of Hibernians.
Nothing wrong. They're legal.
The Irish looking after their own.
But inside them there's another bunch, see, using the Hibernians as cover, calling themselves the Molly Maguires after some gang of cut-throats back in Ireland.
They're all over the coalfields.
I sent in agents at other mines, had two found at the bottom of shafts and one never found at all.
It's your turn here.
I'll do the job for you.
The leaders, that's who I want.
I think I know who they are.
I think they're here, in this very town.
But thinking's not enough.
I got to get them red-handed.
Oh, you'll have them.
You treat them lightly, you'll end up like my other men.
I didn't volunteer to fail.
I've failed enough in this country already.
The streets haven't exactly been paved with gold for me.
But I've had my fill of empty pockets, Captain.
I'm tired of being at the bottom of the barrel.
I'm tired of always looking up.
I want to look down.
I want the Molly Maguires.
Bring me the evidence, that's your job.
Get in with them and bring me enough evidence so we can hang the bastards.
They'll let you out in the morning.
My satchel.
It was left behind when I was carried out last night.
There's a train leaving in 20 minutes.
Where do I get a room around here?
What do you want?
I'll settle for a room.
Who are you?
I'm looking for work.
I need a place to stay.
They told me at the Emerald House you had a room for rent.
- You were the one fighting last night.
- Not the one who started it.
What's your name?
James McKenna.
It's $1.50 a week, room and board.
Right.
You can smoke in here, but not downstairs. My father's ailing.
Supper's at six. If you're late, you'll not be served.
Please do your drinking in a saloon.
Excuse me, what's your name?
Miss Mary Raines.
Well, I'll try not to be too much of a burden, Miss Mary Raines.
You'll be paying for it.
I'm looking for work.
- Any experience?
- A bit.
- Where are you from?
- Here, there.
Well, you look strong enough.
- Five o'clock tomorrow morning.
- Five o'clock.
Make sure you report sober.
Enough now, you're leaving me nothing to wash.
- She's a good girl.
- I can see that.
Only one left now. I've buried a wife and two sons. She's all that's left.
You're still left.
When did you first go down the mines?
Forty-two years ago.
First Ireland, and then here.
There's not many last that long.
There's always them that's worse off than you.
I went down first when I was 12, did you know that?
I've done what God intended for me.
I'll go to Him asking no favour.
I don't believe in going before you're called.
- You're prattling too much.
- I'm only being polite.
You know what the doctor said.
It brings on the coughing.
Do you play dominoes?
- Do you play dominoes?
- Yes.
I'll tell you, you'd have better luck with the Queen.
- That one's got ambitions.
- So have I.
There's pasties and tea for your lunch.
Thank you.
The tea'll be cold when you drink it, but there's no way to keep it hot.
You needrt have risen this early on my account.
I know, I'm paying for it.
Fire!

Take care of them blisters.
- Try rubbing a little grease into them.
- I'll try that.
- Ulster, right?
- Right.
There's a way an Ulster man has of speaking.
- Have you been long in America?
- Long enough.
I've not seen much of America.
Oh, I've been to Philadelphia, but there's more to it than that, I'm sure.
- Have you travelled around much?
- A bit.
Doing what?
A little of this, a little of that.
I'm naturally nosy.
Well, you know, we don't often get strangers here.
You might try changing your reception committee.
And what else do we know about this great nation of ours, the United States of America, whose 100th birthday we're soon to celebrate?
We know it was founded by exiles, immigrants, people like many of you here, who came from across the ocean, seeking a better life.
And our hearts go out to those people.
We identify with them.
For they too were far from the land of their birth.
They too were scorned, and exploited, and subject as you are subject to the terrible temptation of violence.
It becomes easy when we think of those people to think only of their bloody and violent struggle to create this nation.
It's an easy step to the belief that violence is the way to change bad conditions into good conditions.
An easy step, and a false one.
Last night, a colliery was attacked by a gang of men.
The watchman was beaten, the mine flooded.
The men escaped without being recognised.
But they left their calling card in the bloody nature of what they did.
They were Molly Maguires.
I've been your priest for six years now.
Do you know how many last rites I've performed for men killed and crippled, or sickened to death by what was done to them in the mines?
Do you think, any of you, that I don't know the sufferings of my parish?
But I know those sufferings will not be improved by what happened last night.
And I warn you now,
God will judge last night's violence as a sin, and the people that committed that violence will be judged as sinners, and as certain as there's a God above, as sinners they'll be damned.
And it's my duty to warn these men further of a message from the archbishop himself.
The Church condemns all secret societies.
All you who belong to the Molly Maguires know that what you risk is nothing less than... excommunication.
I say now to you wives and sisters and mothers of these men, pray for their repentance.
Pray for them.
They're cutting themselves off from the Church.
Father, I'd like you to meet Mr McKenna.
No apologies for the welcome you received when you arrived.
- You gave as good as you got.
- I did my best.
You might all try turning the other cheek.
- I've known it to work wonders.
- How's the old man, Mary?
Worn out.
I'll see him on Tuesday night.
I trust you'll not be taken in by the troublemakers.
I've never started no trouble, Father.
Excuse me.
Well!
Going to church here is a lively proposition.
- It's no laughing matter.
- Oh, I agree.
Talking back to the priest, that's risking your soul.
Tell me, what's his name?
Jack Kehoe.
- Well, it takes a brave man...
- It takes a fool!
What are you doing here?
- The best I can.
- Who are you?
You try beating it out of me, then you send that kid, hoping to lower my guard with his talk about Ulster.
Tell me what it takes to be left in peace.
- A little information.
- Straight to the point.
- That's a blessing.
- Why did you come?
I came here looking for privacy. And breaking my back, the same as you.
The rest of my life, if you don't mind,
I prefer keeping to myself.
Good night.
If you're making it a choice between getting killed and a little information, well, I'm wanted for shoving the queer.
- What else?
- That's a bellyful right there.
They put you in jail for passing home-made money.
There's better places to hide than a mine.
It's deep.
Another week there, you'll be greeting prison like it was a hotel.
Try another tale.
I'm wanted for killing a man in Buffalo, New York.
- Why did you kill him?
- Does it matter?
I didn't mean for to kill him.
We fought over a woman and I hit him too hard.
- His woman or yours?
- I'm not one for possessions.
If the police had you, why did they let you go?
Didrt know who they had.
The Coal and Iron Police, they're short-sighted about somebody without powder in his pocket.
So now you see why
I'm anxious for privacy.
It's not just the jail I'm hoping to avoid, it's the hangman.
- Sorry-looking cabbage patch.
- Blame the Kerrigans' goat.
- It's the fourth time. Mend the fence.
- I'll lay Kerrigan out.
- That won't stop the goat.
- He should have it on a rope.
Why werert the boys keeping watch?
I gave them leave to play.
Thick as thieves, the two of you kicking that ball.
Be careful with him, Jack.
- He's bold.
- That's no reason for trust.
It's not such a common sight, a bold man.
What else is he? Besides bold?
Well, he's got a way with him.
Don't get too fond of him, Jack.
You wouldn't trust the Pope himself, would you?
I'd trust him with souls.
It's not your soul I'm worried about.
There's only one sure way of finding out. Turn him in.
Suppose it's the truth?
Terrible thing on your conscience.
Sooner that than have a spy turning us in.
You want revenge for how he thrashed you.
He wouldn't stay down. I give him credit.
- We've no proof he's a spy.
- No proof he's not.
Raines says he's asking questions.
What would you do in a strange town, besides looking for beer and a fight?
I don't care if he's a murderer.
If we turn him in, and he's a spy...
- We're through worrying.
- They'll send another.
- We'll take care of him.
- They'll send more.
Can't keep them out.
Same in every pit.
- If not him, another.
- What are you saying?
- We just roll over?
- Nobody's rolling over.
- We did that once.
- That's not all.
We stayed out six months.
Nobody's done that before.
- We went back.
- They had troops.
And took less.
- We had to think of the kids.
- We crawled.
They cracked the whip, we crawled.
We tried peaceful and ended begging.
- We lost the battle. We'll win the war.
- I don't know.
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We won't turn him in. If he's on the square, it's a low thing to do.
If he's a spy, we'll take care of him.
Show them we mean business?
Nothing simpler than that.
Don't push him out of the way next time.
He's clever.
He won't tip his hand, he's too smart.
There's one way to be sure.
- How, Jack? How?
- Use him.
You wait, Taffy! They'll be back stuffing it down your mars throat!
- My name is not Taffy.
- I thought you were all called Taffy!
- Let's go!
- Where do you think she is going?
With the winner, like we agreed.
It wasnt agreed by me, Paddy.
Now, Taffy, you're wounded at losing.
- While I'm overcome with sympathy...
- Enough, now. I'm warning you.
"Taffy was a Welshman
Taffy was a thief
"Taffy come to my house
And stole a chunk of beef."
That's the way to have it, now.
Two mines compete, he owns both.
Whichever one wins, he can't lose.
Mr Gowers a fine-looking man.
He shows no strain from carrying all that money.
I guess one never tires of it.
He's an Irishman, the same as you.
What he did, you can do.
He's not the same as me.
He's a Protestant.
He got where he is by using the brains God gave him.
There's no reason anyone can't do as well.
Well, now, I have every intention...
All right.
Clear the field. Everybody home.
Come on, now.
Come on, now. Off with you.
Go home.
Move it out.
Let's go, let's go. Come on.
Tom? Are you shot, Tom?
- Did he wound you with the gun?
- No.
That Welsh bastard.
I'll take care of him.
You'll take care of nobody, drunkard!
Making trouble with the police here!
They're itching for it.
You're the prize they're setting up.
Think their guns are ornaments?
- He tried to plug me.
- I'm only sorry he missed.
- You dented it.
- Head got in the way.
And the peeler?
Sorry he didn't club me to death?
- We'll handle him.
- There he goes, free as air.
We don't play their game.
I'll lay him out.
I'll make his head softer than his arse.
No. Not you.
Silver plate.
Not the real thing at all.
- Who did it?
- Did what?
Don't play games with me.
My mars in hospital with a broken jaw.
Who put him there?
I did.
Nothing personal.
Important to make it look real.
- They were testing me.
- I don't like losing good men.
You're lucky he's in hospital.
I saw what he did to Dougherty.
Whatever I gave him, he had it coming.
Only rats.
You get used to them down here.
Who did the shooting?
Gomer James, Tamaqua man. Welsh.
- Will Dougherty go after him now?
- He wants to. His pride's hurt.
- They're holding him back.
- Encourage him.
Only way we'll get them is in the act.
We'll put a guard on James.
Not too much of a guard.
You don't want simple assault.
You want murder.
I'll take what I get.
How would you like to spend the rest of your life down here?
I tried it when I first came over.
- How did you get out?
- Made myself useful in other ways.
I'd have to get out.
I'd kill somebody if I couldn't.
Don't get confused about which side you're on.
I could always tell the buttered side from the dry.
- Evening, Mary.
- Hello, Jack.
- Some jam for the old mars tea.
- Thanks.
You're looking good.
We could've used you on the football field.
- I'm running down like an old clock.
- You'll be ticking for a long time.
How's the pit?
Have you blasted through No. 5 tunnel?
No. No, they feared for the gas.
They could trap that gas if they blast right.
- There's lashes of coal. I could smell it.
- They'll get plenty.
- You worry about yourself.
- I've nothing to worry about.
If you were ten years younger,
I'd slap you silly for that remark.
Come in.
- Hello, boys.
- Hello.
Leave us alone, would you, Mary?
I thought you'd come on a social visit.
Out you go, Dan.
Get on your knees.
I will explain to you the object of the Ancient Order of Hibernians.
We are joined to promote friendship, unity and charity among our members.
You are to keep all matters secret in your heart.
No workings of the society shall be called to those not known to be members.
That's right, now. That's correct.
And what's the answering sign?
No!
The little finger!
That's the recognition sign!
Oh, then there's the password when you go from one division to another.
"Will tenant right in Ireland flourish?"
"If the people unite and the landlords subdue."
"If the people unite and the landlords subdue."
And there's plenty of truth in that password. Unity, that's the answer.
Then there's the quarrelling word.
When you're ready to bash a stranger but you want to make certain he's not one of us...
- "Your temper is high."
- "I've good reason."
- "I've good reason."
- Then you don't have to bash him.
- Not one nip to celebrate a new convert?
- He don't touch it himself.
Did the drink interfere with your thinking?
What're you thinking now, Black Jack, with that solemn look on your mug?
I'm thinking you'd better be what we think you are.
I'm what you think.
'Cause if you're not, there's no hole deep enough for you to hide this time.
I'm what you think I am.
Do you know what you're getting into?
Do you know what you joined?
- A legal organisation.
- On the face of it.
- Respectable, law-abiding.
- You heard what the Father said.
There's no future for what you joined except hell.
I'm a miner now. I'll be travelling in that direction anyway, just out of habit.
Will you come to the city with me, just for the day?
I thought you were different from them.
Well, come with me, find out.
- I've been to the city.
- Not with me, you haven't.
A lucky accident, I call it.
Only a few mashed fingers for the pleasure of a day with you.
Mrs Kehoe promised she'd look in, didn't she?
The old man won't even know you're gone.
When were you last in the city?
- A year ago.
- Well, it's time again, isn't it?
For a bit of enjoyment?
Or an act of charity for a man heading for hell?
- Try this one.
- I just tried two.
Try another. I intend buying you a hat.
Do you want it to your taste or to mine?
I have a hat.
I'll be back in a minute.
And damn the expense.
Where are you going?
To rob a bank... to pay for the hat.
- Have you got the money?
- So they've accepted you.
- In the Hibernians, not the Mollies yet.
- They will. Who was at the initiation?
That's no evidence.
The Order's secret, but it's legal.
Look, we'll judge what's evidence.
You just give me the names.
Dougherty, McAndrew,
Frazier... and Kehoe.
- The money?
- What do you need it for?
I said I was pushing queer.
I need the good stuff to show for it.
What is the meaning of that?
Oh, how's carelessness?
If you please, I have a lady waiting.
Don't look so sour, Captain.
It's not coming out of your pocket.
The light won't make a difference.
I...
I had a most enjoyable day.
You can't keep putting off what you're feeling. It's unealthy.
Good night.
- Tea?
- No.
- Or a story?
- It's late for stories.
Do you take me so easy
I can be had for a trip to the city?
You think where there's wanting, there can't be respect?
- I don't take you "easy" at all.
- Then have done with it.
There's no future here for romance.
Will you deny that?
- It's queer.
- Aye, so it is.
Passed by a man answering your description.
- I've a common appearance.
- I think it was you.
- It's a free country for thought.
- You're a bad lot.
You passed this, and you're mixed up in what happened to that train.
- You're just mixed up.
- You're not telling me the truth.
I wouldn't lie to you, Captain.
- You might.
- I'm on the side of law and order.
I want you in line, McKenna.
Step out of line, I'll step on you.
I'll squash you like a bug.
I think we should improve that bastard's manners.
We can do without his attention.
No more of this.
- Keep that squealer quiet!
- What do you think I'm trying?
- Stuff his head in a pillow.
- I'll stuff your head first!
We've a friend in the Governor's chair and we mean to keep him there.
It's up to you to get the vote.
Politicians! They'd sell their mother for a vote.
The Governor grants pardons.
You may need one.
The raffle for Barney Breslirs widow.
- Got the prize?
- I've got it.
Sell the tickets.
They're only a penny and she'll benefit.
Any new business?
Next meeting's two weeks from tonight.
In whose house?
Kerrigan?
- All right.
- That's it, then.
I declare this meeting adjourned.
Good night.
- Good night, Jack.
- Good night.
Stay a bit, why don't you?
Unless you're bleeding to get back to your landlady.
- How's the hand?
- Better.
Don't let on too quick that it's healed.
They'll send you back down.
All right.
We had a request from Shenandoah.
Superintendent's giving trouble.
- What kind?
- Firing without cause, cutting wages.
He's new and looking to make an impression.
We've been asked to make an impression on him.
I joined the Hibernians.
"All things lawful and not otherwise."
Remember? I took an oath.
This isn't the Hibernians.
Why can't they do it themselves?
If they're seen, they'd be recognised.
Over there nobody knows us.
He'd be surrounded by peelers.
New boss, throwing his weight around.
- They know he's asking for it.
- They won't suspect.
- It's a risk for a quarrel that's not ours.
- They're miners like us, Irishmen.
They've the same heel on their neck.
It's all one quarrel.
They'd do the same for us.
I do my own quarrelling.
I don't ask anyone else.
- You're not on your own now.
- They want him killed or only bashed?
- Killed.
- He sounds deserving.
I'm against it. Give him a bashing and he'll get the drift.
- He's not won'th hanging for.
- What good's that? He'll be back.
Bash him so he don't come back.
Then we've done it right, without the gallows.
You end up on the gallows or coughing your lungs out. What's the difference?
It's the coarse feel of rope I don't like.
- We'll vote.
- I'm for killing.
I say bash him, see what he learns from it.
They don't learn. They're all the same.
Our backs is where they make their impression.
They're past learning lessons.
I say dispose of him.
I'm for that, too.
I'm for bashing him.
What happens with a tie?
We can't take the job, and they give it out elsewhere.
- There's no killing without a majority.
- We're a democratic organisation.
If this is our quarrel, like you say, we can't have them thinking we're soft.
They can think what they like.
How do you vote?
Kill the son of a bitch.
Whoa, boy.
Stand where you are.
A bloody reception committee.
He was supposed to be alone.
- Well, he wasnt.
- Who tipped him off?
How the hell do I know?
Shut your face and be glad you're alive.
If you hadrt come back to give me a hand...
- I'm grateful for that.
- It's all for one and one for all.
You said he'd be surrounded.
We should've listened.
We did what we went to do.
- Easy now.
- Easy yourself.
What are you so hot about?
Want me layir there dead?
I'd do a lot less worrying if you were.
She's got hands like meat cleavers.
We'll need alibis.
They'll try and trace us.
They got a look, and there's no hiding him.
You think somebody tipped him off?
If there's informing, it's a Shenandoah man.
They were giving him protection.
We expected that.
- They told us he'd be alone.
- They told us wrong.
Even if it's true, it's their word against ours.
All we have to do is stick together.
They can't get us if we stick together.
All for one, one for all.
You sound like a bloody parrot.
Go to bed and get some rest.
I'll do that.
I'll be as right as rain in the morning.
Good night.
You're worried.
They'll be coming after us now.
We must be prepared for that.
You've got to face the fact there might be a spy.
"One for all and all for one."
Is that some sort of saying?
It's from a book about Frenchmen, the Musketeers.
It's a sort of rallying cry when one of them got into a scrape.
- I don't read much.
- You learn a lot from books.
I'm always meaning to read a good book.
You know, you could have got your lot going back for Frazier.
I've a charmed life.
Good night.
Good night, Jack.
Him... Him, him.
Him, the fellow at the back.
The big fellow at the back.
Him and him... Come on, now.
Come on, get them in the wagon!
Close the door.
McKenna?
Out.
Scum. Take them off the streets, put them in uniform, still scum.
I had that superintendent protected like a baby.
They almost got me, if that's any consolation.
- It's not. Who did it?
- Kehoe, Frazier and me.
- How did we do?
- He's alive, but not by much.
Kehoe's wife, two of her friends say he was with them and the children all day, never left the house.
Frazier was brawling in the saloon and got winged.
Twelve witnesses swear to that.
Raines and his daughter say that you were with them all day.
The daughter, too?
- I wasnt quite sure she'd do that.
- Don't credit your charm.
Most likely she's one of them.
If I could charge Frazier and Kehoe, it would be your word against theirs.
Well, you'll need a little more than that.
Oh, yes. I need them caught in the act, no chance of an alibi.
Not just two of them, the organisation.
I want it smashed.
Any bastard who dreams of making trouble,
I want him to wake up sweating blood at what happened to the Molly Maguires.
Not yet.
I can't send you back unmarked.
Well, it's a pleasure working with a man who likes his job.
You did a clean job.
The superintendent's dead.
I used to come up here when I was little.
There's never enough green down where we are.
Even in summer, the trees are black with coal dust.
- Do you like riddles?
- If I know the answers.
All right. A bottomless barrel, it's shaped like a hive.
- Filled full of flesh, which is alive.
- A thimble.
You're quick!
You've a way with chicken.
Did you catch it at the cockfights?
- I got a taste of the spur.
- You have not!
The round man looks through 1,000 eyes.
A sieve.
You're almost as good a cook as my ma.
Is that a compliment or an insult?
Oh, my ma was a grand cook.
It wasnt easy making a tasty dish out of oats stolen from a horse.
Did I thank you for lying to the police about me?
The old man did the lying.
I only did the agreeing.
I know what a lie means to a girl of your morality.
You've a bad habit of making jokes on the wrong subject.
I did what had to be done, no more and no less.
- Did you expect me to do otherwise?
- I hoped part of it was personal.
- You can hope what you please.
- I thank you for what you did.
Well, don't go thinking I liked doing it.
Lying's a sin and killing's worse.
I can't even go to confession with it.
I envy your morality... and that's the truth.
Snug in a corner, I saw the lad lie.
Fire in his heart, a cork in his eye.
A bottle of whisky.
- Out she goes with the priest's dinner.
- A hen with an egg.
- There's no catching you.
- Not with words.
I'm what you need.
I need a decent man.
- Stand by the pithead. You can choose.
- I don't want them.
Go back into service.
Marry the postman or the policeman, with his hand out for what he can get.
- Don't mock!
- You want decency.
And trust, and honour, and a bit of security, all smiled upon by the law.
Think you get those for free?
You've been out there and seen for yourself.
Decency is not for the poor.
You pay for decency, you buy it.
And you buy the law too, like a loaf of bread.
There's still right and wrong.
There's what you want and what you'll pay to get it.
There's more!
'Tis round a dish was ever known, and white as snow the look of it.
There's food and life for all mankind yet no man e'er partook of it.
- Let me go.
- This time you're caught.
I'm not.
Answer me, then.
Breast milk.
There's no use talking further.
A mars been murdered.
He brought it on himself.
He who lives by the sword shall perish by the sword.
But his wife's dead too, a child's been orphaned.
Violence begets violence until the innocent perish with the guilty.
Is it any use reminding you of that?
Or am I wasting my breath again?
Innocent or guilty, these were both children of God.
They died victims of a sinful lust for killing.
At least they found their peace.
I wish I could say the same for the rest of you.
She saw them, she said.
Old lady Regan.
The shots woke her.
She saw them running from the house.
She's certain they were peelers?
She could see the stripes on their trousers.
You'd think they'd at least take off their uniforms.
They want us knowing who they are.
They're telling us it don't matter.
The law's what they say.
There's only one way to deal with them.
An eye for an eye.
- Two of them for two of us.
- Don't be a fool!
You've a better idea?
- They want you to retaliate.
- Happy to oblige!
You can't win that way. They know that.
They did it so you'd show yourself.
- They murdered him!
- The police are waiting.
- How are you so sure?
- I've had experience.
- Don't play their game!
- Frazier was our buddy!
You know what'll happen. Tell them.
They'll destroy us all.
They're out to get us. If we don't go to them, they'll come to us.
- Shoot us in our beds.
- Then protect yourself.
They won't stop.
That's the meaning of it.
- They won't stop, so we can't stop.
- You don't want to stop.
They kill us in the pit. Should we quit now they're killing us in our sleep?
You don't care what happens.
Even if they did stop, you'd go on.
- There's nowhere to go.
- Knowing we'll be destroyed?
- There's no choice. They made sure.
- You can't win!
I'm finished moving, pit after pit.
You can't win.
I won't move.
- You scared him off.
- Who?
Looks like a robin.
Looks like a robin, but who's to know what he really is?
These days you can't judge from looks.
- You like birds?
- I like some birds.
You've got feathers on your mouth like you just made a meal of one.
Well, we've got them now.
All this shooting and killing, the citizens won't stand for any more.
Put a man into the dock, call him a Molly.
You've not done a bad job.
The Agency's very pleased.
There may be a promotion out of it.
- You talk like it's finished.
- We got one, we'll get the rest.
- It's only a matter of time.
- Aye, they won't stop now.
- We'll see to that.
- You won't have to.
They'll do everything themselves.
Everything except tie the rope.
- I tried to stop them this time.
- That was clever.
No, no, I mean I really tried.
I tried to talk them out of it.
- I tried my best.
- You were lucky you didn't succeed.
What are you doing here anyway?
Stupid bloody bird.
I don't find birds very musical.
"Singing like a bird."
What are they all going on about?
Cricket's more musical.
Kehoe. I want him most.
You'll have him.
Kehoe!
Kehoe!
Kehoe!
The priest sent for me.
- He's inside.
- The old man?
There's nothing to do now but wait.
Hello, Father.
I've just come from Philadelphia, seeing the archbishop there.
Dougherty's to be tried for the killing of the superintendent.
- He'd nothing to do with it.
- They're calling him an accomplice.
I thought the archbishop might use his influence to get the charge reduced.
You're the one I blame most.
You're the leader.
- The men listen to you.
- They listen to you, too.
- Come back to the Church, Kehoe.
- I never left it.
You've put yourself outside.
Come back while there's still time.
I've tried your way.
It's been no help to me.
There's grace at the end of it.
Sin at the start and grace at the end, bending your head in between.
I can't accept that, Father.
Then you'll die in sin.
What did the archbishop say about Dougherty?
He's good as hanged.
There's still the trial.
- They need evidence.
- They've got it.
The archbishop told me.
You've an informer in your midst.
Who?
He didn't tell me that.
I didn't think you touched the stuff.
I take a drop now and again.
I'm impressed by your idea of a drop.
Are you mourning that deep for the old man?
If you ask me, he was glad to go.
No spirit left in him at all.
For Dougherty then?
There's time enough for that.
He isn't hanged yet.
You're a cool one.
That's the difference between us, Jack.
I have no coolness in me at all.
You're burning up inside.
I saw you for that right from the beginning.
If I were you, I'd take it easy with that bottle.
Fuel to the fire?
Yeah, I've seen it before with people like you.
One drop and raging to tear up the world.
They lose all reason.
But you're a reasonable man.
- I try to keep my wits about me, yes.
- But you won't die reasonable.
I won't die at all.
Havert I told you that, Jack?
I'm living forever.
You won't die like him.
You won't go quiet.
He never made a sound.
As near to him as I am to you and I never heard him go.
Not even a peep.
Not even the sound a bug makes when you step on it.
- Not even a rattle of his throat.
- He was always soft-spoken.
But never a sound of his own.
Forty-two years in the pits, not even an echo left hanging in the air.
Let's hear a sound out of you now.
Make your sound now, you old bastard!
You're safe among friends.
Tell us what you've been keeping to yourself.
Come on now, whisper it.
- You don't even have to sit up.
- They finished him.
Silence is golden, is that it?
Seen but not heard.
They beat that lesson into you.
- You poor, miserable son of a bitch.
- Respect for the dead!
He had it in his hands.
He knew how to use the powder.
He showed me.
I'd have blown myself up without him.
Why couldn't he use it for himself?
Once, for his own benefit!
Just to show them that he was alive!
They didn't even know he was there!
Jack.
An animal makes a sound.
He had it to use.
Why didn't he use it?
It was all he had, didn't he know?
What more did they have to do?
They took everything else.
Look at him now! They haven't even left him a suit to be buried in!
It's not right...
...burying a man without proper clothes.
No, it's not!
And he'll have the suit.
They owe him that much.
This'll do him.
Jack!
- Jack, let's go!
- Take him the suit.
Jamey!
We'll show them spirit, Jamey!
We're not dead yet!
Thank you.
Watch here.
The Grand Inquest of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, inquiring for the County of Schuylkill, upon their respective oaths and affirmations, do present that John Kehoe, Frank McAndrew, and Thomas Dougherty, accomplice, with force and arms, in and upon one John W Jones, superintendent of the
Shenandoah Colliery, did make an assault and with pistols loaded with gunpowder, bullets and other destructive material, then and there wilfully, feloniously, and of their malice aforethought, did kill and murder the said John W Jones, contrary to the form of the act of the General Assembly, in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
- The Commonwealth will proceed.
- Thank you, Your Honour.
Call the first witness.
Raise your right hand, please.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
Proceed.
What is your full name?
James McParlan.
What is your occupation?
Detective.
Bastard! Bastard!
Jury's coming in.
Your deal.
Guilty.
Will the defendants stand to be sentenced?
Now having been found guilty of the charge of murder in the first degree, this court sentences you, John Kehoe,
Frank McAndrew, Thomas Dougherty, to be confined to the county prison until the date of your execution, when you shall be hanged by the neck until dead.
I'll take you out now.
There's a carriage waiting.
I talked to the boss.
He'll tell you, but you might like to know.
We're opening a new office in Denver.
He thinks you could be in charge.
- Let's go.
- You're moving up the ladder.
- I know.
- You'll get over this.
I know that, too.
I only have to get high enough.
I would have gone with you.
Even if you had been outside the law.
I'd have risked the sin of that.
I was the one who always told you
I could take you out of here.
I can do that now.
Do you know what I'm sorriest about?
I used to think there was nothing
I wouldn't do to get out.
And then, when I couldn't do it alone,
I thought there was no one
I wouldn't go with, if I liked him, and he could offer me that.
I'm sorry it isn't true.
I'm sorry I can't do it.
I really am.
I want it so!
Hello, Jack.
Come in.
I wasnt sure of the reception.
- You're a relief from cockroaches.
- Got everything you need?
I could use some powder.
I've sworn off since I left the Mollies.
Have a seat.
Still think you can do it with powder?
- Is that what you're here to ask?
- Just curious.
I mean, do you think you really could've won?
Well, then, why?
You know why as much as me.
You worked down there. Could you see yourself not lifting a finger?
- I wouldn't stay. I'd get out.
- Where would you find it different?
There's them on top and them below.
Push up or push down.
- Who's got more push is what counts.
- They always had more.
We had a bit.
Not enough, but a bit.
Enough to push the bastards a little.
And you helped us.
- You pushed a little yourself.
- Part of the job.
Going back for Frazier.
- You did that on your own.
- Don't be so sure.
- It got me in better with you.
- You liked bashing that policeman.
- Well, I must admit...
- And setting fire to the store.
- You werert working only for them.
- It made a lovely blaze.
You were a man then.
Why didn't you stop, Jack?
I tried to get you to stop.
Well, they had to nab us sooner or later.
I have one regret now:
They're shipping some coal.
I had plans for that, on a bridge.
We'd have blown the train and bridge.
That would've been a sight.
I'd have tipped them off.
That's true.
Well, I don't regret it so much, then.
You made your sound, Jack.
You've got no regrets there.
You used your powder.
Aye.
But you didn't come here to chat.
Nor to ask questions or say farewell.
We'll just leave it that I came, then.
You came for absolution.
You're not a priest, Jack.
You'd like to be set free from what you've done.
I'm not that soft.
Oh, you don't want forgiving.
You can get that from a woman.
Punishment, that's what you want.
You think punishment will set you free.
And that's why you've come, looking for punishment.
Maybe it's my Christian heart.
I never could stand to see a man carrying a cross.
Are you free now?
Have I set you free for a grand new life?
I'm obliged to you.
You'll never be free.
No punishment this side of hell can free you from what you did.
See you in hell.
M..., a town in northern Italy.
What is it?
The marquise of o...
The daughter of...?
Yes. Listen to this.
It's all here word for word.
The undersigned declares that, without her knowing how, she became pregnant.
The father of the child she is bearing is asked to report himself.
We have, for family reasons, decided to marry him.
The marquise of o... a lady of unblemished reputation, mother of several well-bred children, daughter of the commandant of the citadel.
About three years ago, she lost her husband, the marquis, whilst on a journey.
After the marquis' death, she left her country estate where she had lived until then, and returned, with her two children, to the commandant's house.
Suddenly the war... the russian troops have broken into the citadel.
They want us to surrender.
I will retort with shot and shell.
I must carry on as if my family were not here.
Lorenzo!
Madame, may i offer you my arm.
I'm going to call a doctor.
That won't be necessary.
The marquise only needs sleep.
A sleeping potion is the best remedy.
With your permission, marquise, i'll take my leave.
Leopardo!
Go get some poppy seed tea.
We can expect no mercy.
Form your ranks!
You have been defeated!
Your sword.
I was only awaiting your request.
May i see my family?
- Where is Julietta?
- She is... she is out of danger.
I took her to the west wing.
Go back to the castle.
I'll watch over her myself.
My respects, commandant.
I regret that your courage was not helped by better luck.
Give me your word and you may go wherever you like.
You have my word.
I thank you earnestly.
I am greatly indebted to the russians today, especially to that young lieutenant-colonel!
What happened?
I was informed of an odious attempt on my daughter.
A troop of soldiers was assaulting her.
The Lt. Colonel, in a brave personal intervention, saved her.
You have honoured our regiment and kept up our traditions.
But who are these rascals who have tarnished the czar's name?
I'll have them shot.
General, i appeal to your leniency... i am unable to give you their names.
In the feeble glimmer of the castle-yard lamps... it was impossible to discern their faces.
I am surprised.
The castle was already in flames.
One can recognize people even in the darkest night, by their voices.
All right.
In any case, investigate the matter at once.
Excellency, one of the villains wounded by the count has been captured by the commandant's men.
Fetch him!
Let him name his accomplices!
They're all to be shot.
Don't worry! The battle is over.
And my father?
He is alive and well, and free, and wants to see you.
Did madame sleep well?
Poppy seed tea prevents bad dreams.
Julietta, my beloved child!
I had to surrender, but my honour is safe.
The russians are gentlemen.
On the general's orders, the brutes who attacked you have been shot.
Father, i have only one wish:
To thank my saviour as soon as possible.
It's too late.
That means the russian troops are leaving the citadel.
So is the count.
But i must see him again and thank him.
I'm sure you'll find some occasion in the future.
A few days later... dead!
With my own eyes, i saw the count, mortally wounded in the chest, being carried off to a village where, at the very moment when his bearers were lifting him from their shoulders, he expired.
The family had to vacate the castle, and took a house in town.
Life went back to normal.
How pretty!
My lady!
What's wrong?
How strange, i who always have been in such good health.
What's wrong with you?
You look sick.
If a woman were to tell me that she felt as i did just now i should certainly think to myself that she was pregnant.
I don't know what you mean.
I just felt the same way i did when i was expecting my second daughter.
Perhaps you'll give birth to a fantasy!
The father will be morpheus or one of his pageant of dreams... not long after this...
The russian Lt. Colonel, the count...
The count!
Yes, the count.
Impossible!
You must be mistaken.
I saw and heard correctly.
He is waiting in the anteroom.
Forgive us.
You cannot understand our astonishment.
We thought you were dead.
I'm alive.
Yes, i'm alive.
How do you feel?
Very well. But how did you come back to life?
You are not telling me the truth.
There is a strange weariness in your face.
Unless i'm mistaken, you are ill.
Well, yes... this "weariness", as you call it, is perhaps the last trace of an indisposition which i suffered a few weeks ago.
I don't think any more will come of it.
Nor do i!
Will you marry me?
Did you understand me?
Will you marry me?
Please be seated... my son... indeed, we shall think you are a ghost, until you've told us how you rose up out of the grave.
Circumstances force me to be brief.
Seriously wounded in the chest, i was carried to a village.
For several months, i wavered between life and death.
My only thought was for the marquise.
Words cannot describe how pleasure and pain alternated in this image of her.
At last i recovered and returned to the army, but i felt terribly restless.
More than once i reached for a pen to pour my heart out to you and the marquise.
But i was unexpectedly sent to naples with dispatches and cannot be sure that constantinople will not be my next station, or even st. Petersburg.
And yet, i find it henceforth impossible to live any longer unless my restless soul be given a clear-cut reply.
As i passed through this town, i could not resist taking a few steps towards this end.
I could not help myself. In short, i very much hope that the marquise's hand will be awarded to me, and i respectfully beg you to grant me instantly a favourable answer.
To be sure, this request, which, undoubtedly, is seriously intended, is most flattering.
After her husband's death, my daughter made up her mind never to marry again.
But, since she recently became so greatly obligated to you, it is not so impossible that this should sway her from her resolution.
Meanwhile, allow her some time to think it over quietly.
Colonel, i assure you, your kind reply is a great encouragement to my hopes.
In other circumstances, it would have made me perfectly content.
I appreciate how boorish it is of me not to settle for it.
But compelling reasons, which i cannot go into, make a definite reply extremely desirable.
The horses taking me to naples are already harnessed.
I implore you, if anything here speaks well on my behalf, do not let me leave without a more favourable answer.
Count, the gratitude my daughter feels for you entitles you to be optimistic, but not overly so.
She can only, in a matter on which her happiness depends, act with great consideration.
It is imperative that my daughter, before replying, should get to know you better.
I invite you, after your mission is done, to return here, and be our guest for a while.
If the marquise thinks that she could be happy with you, i would then, but only then, be also delighted to hear that she had given you a precise answer.
I foresaw that my impatience would meet with this fate.
Until i know, i will remain utterly miserable.
Seeing the unhappy role i am now forced to play, to be known better to you is all to the good.
As to my reputation, if consideration should be given to something so deceptive, i can vouch for it.
The only dishonourable act i've ever committed has been kept secret, and i'm about to make amends for it.
In short, i am a man of honour.
Please take my word for it.
I quite agree with you.
I have never met a young man who, in so short a time, has revealed so many superior traits of character.
It will take but a short period of reflection to lift the veil of indecision.
Until i have consulted with my family and with yours, count, no other reply is possible.
My parents are dead, i am my own master.
I am a man of means.
A period of reflection is necessary.
Until your return, please don't insist further.
I did everything i could to get out of this mission.
To no avail.
And now i am in the throes of despair.
If there is the slightest chance that i may be granted my wish, i'll put off my departure for a day, or for longer.
Go along, count. Leave for naples.
When you return, give us the pleasure of your company, and then we'll see.
I came here with high hopes.
They were premature.
You rightly wish to know me better.
I'll return my dispatches to H.Q.
And accept your kind invitation.
It would grieve me if the passionate feelings you seem to have for my daughter were to lead you into serious trouble.
But you know what is best for you.
Send your dispatches back and move into your room.
Well?
He can't send his dispatches back, renounce taking them to naples, simply because he was unable, during a 5 minute conversation, to obtain from a lady he hardly knows a consent to his proposal.
Such reckless behaviour will be punished with imprisonment.
And he'll be dismissed, too.
But there is no danger of that.
It's just a bluff.
He will think twice before returning the dispatches.
I'm afraid he will return them.
His stubborn, single-minded nature seems quite capable of it.
Go, dissuade him from this unfortunate action.
My interference might have the opposite effect, and give him more faith in his plan.
I think so too.
But the dispatches will surely be sent back, if we do nothing.
He'd rather bring disaster on himself than admit he was pretending.
Extraordinary behaviour!
He seems to storm ladies' hearts as if they were fortresses.
Look!
He's having his luggage unloaded.
We must go see him. Come with me!
You are expediting your business on an inappropriate table.
Do you want your room?
Thank you, but i'm already done.
What time is it?
Have a good journey.
Count, unless you have very weighty reasons... most compelling ones!
Drive on!
Would someone show me to my room?
It would be an honour for me.
Have the luggage taken up.
And you, what do you make of the whole thing?
If father had prevailed on him to go to naples, all would have been well.
To naples!
Should i have called a priest?
Or had him arrested and sent under guard to naples?
No, but a real effort to remonstrate with him would have had an effect.
Count, forgive me if i come back to this.
I hold your loyalty and courage in great esteem.
I know that on the night your men captured the fort you risked your life for my daughter.
I thus would deplore it if in following your impetuous inclination...
"inclination!"
...you had jeopardized a promising future.
It is not an "inclination".
You know, during my illness, the marquise was sitting at my bedside.
In my delirium, i kept confusing her with the sight of a swan.
A swan?
A swan i'd seen as a boy on my uncle's estate.
One recollection especially moved me.
This swan, i once... i'm terribly in love with you.
Allow me to withdraw.
How should one react?
Let matters take their course.
He's counting on the influence of his relatives.
Or he'll be ignominiously dismissed.
What do you think of him?
Can you come up with something that will avert a catastrophe?
Mother dear, that is not possible!
I am sorry that my gratitude be put to such a hard test.
But i had made up my mind not to remarry.
I can't risk my happiness a second time.
Not without giving it much thought.
If such is your decision, it would be of help to him to know it.
He needs to be given a definite answer.
How do you like... his appearance?
I cannot tell... whether i like him or not.
How do you feel?
Supposing he returns from naples and nothing we learn about him in the meantime contradicts the general impression you have on him now, what would you answer if he renewed his offer on his return?
In that case i might... since his desire for me is so strong, if he wished it, i would be ready to marry him for the sake of what i owe him.
Dear julietta!
I had always wished you to remarry.
If julietta is considering giving her hand some day to the count, then we must at once say something to him, to avert the consequences of his folly.
Perhaps he might be told something to the effect that until his return from naples, you won't enter into any other engagement.
I can promise him that.
But i fear it will not reassure him, and will get us all embroiled.
Let me worry about that!
Lorenzo, what do you think?
With this harmless assurance, i'll get the count out of the house.
Then do it! Do it right now!
Here i am, surrendering to this russian a second time!
How can we tell the count right away?
Leave that to me.
Count! Don't you know?
I know what i need to know.
Can you get a coach for me?
I fear that your impetuous hopes have led you... not at all, you've agreed to nothing.
If the reports you get about me contradict the feeling that moved you to call me back into this room.
Take my coach.
A footman will get you some fresh horses.
I hope to overtake my dispatches at my H.Q.
From there, i'll take the shortest route to naples.
In naples, i'll do my best to get out of having to go to constantinople.
If there are no unforeseeable delays, i will be back in about four to six weeks.
Well, julietta, i feel a great deal easier.
Even though my fondest wish was to marry you before i left.
Marry!
Yes, to marry!
Have you lost your senses?
Some day you'll understand.
I beg you to forget what i just said.
The coach is ready.
Several weeks went by.
And, from day to day... yes, it really is as if... but, mother, it couldn't be!
It's impossible!
What other explanation?
I don't know.
Something is definitely wrong.
I've read that women could show symptoms of pregnancy without really being pregnant.
Your health worries me.
If you are ill, you should see a doctor.
Your diagnosis was accurate.
What do you mean?
You're in perfect health.
You don't need a physician.
Please leave, doctor.
I'm in no mood for jokes.
I wish you'd always been as little inclined to joking.
I will report these insults to my father.
Madame, i am not joking.
I could... swear to this opinion in a court of law!
But how is it possible, doctor?
I hardly feel there's a need to explain its working principles to you!
What did the doctor say?
Why are you so upset?
What did he tell you?
He said i'm in perfect health and expecting a child.
He's shameless.
Frivolous quack!
Your father must know of this insult.
It was not an insult.
He was quite earnest.
He is prepared to repeat his mad opinion in front of my father.
Do you think it is possible?
I'd sooner believe that graves could be fertile, or that the dead could give birth!
My strange child, what is tormenting you?
If your conscience is clear, the opinion of a whole panel of doctors should not bother you.
He is either mistaken or malicious, what do you care?
My god!
How can i feel calm?
Don't my own innermost feelings argue against me?
If i heard another woman had these symptoms, would i not myself feel that she was pregnant?
Malice!
Mistake!
Why would a man, hitherto so worthy of esteem, deliberately want to humiliate me?
I have never offended him, i who received him with confidence, anticipating gratitude.
As his first words showed, he came with a sincere desire to help me, not to cause me greater pain.
Since a choice has to be made, if i conclude he made a mistake, is it possible that a doctor, even a mediocre one, could err in such a matter?
And yet it has to be one or the other.
My dear mother, it must be.
But my case is so strange, you must allow me to have my doubts.
I swear, for some assurance is needed, that i am as innocent as my own children.
Your own conscience, my respected mother, can be no clearer.
Nevertheless, call a midwife so i may discover what it is, and, whatever it may be, find some peace of mind.
A clear conscience and a midwife!
A midwife, dear mother!
And instantly, or i'll go mad!
It will be a pleasure.
But please don't give birth in my house.
If a life without blemish, a life that followed your example entitles me to your esteem, if you still have maternal feelings in your heart, for as long as my guilt is unproven, don't forsake me at this terrible hour.
What is disturbing you?
Just the doctor's diagnosis?
Just your innermost feelings?
Nothing else, mother.
Nothing, julietta?
Think a moment.
A misstep, however painful it may be to me, i'd have to forgive in the end.
But if, to avoid your mother's anger, you have invented a fairy tale of unnatural calamities, piling one blasphemous oath on another, to take advantage of my trust in you, this would be shameful!
And i could never love you again.
May the kingdom of heaven lie as open to me some day, as my heart is open to you now.
I have concealed nothing from you, my mother.
Heavens!
My child!
How sorry i am for you!
What on earth are you afraid of?
You look quite ill.
I am in perfect health, and nothing is wrong with me, except this strange and inexplicable condition.
"Condition?"
What "condition"?
If you're so sure of your memory, isn't it madness to be so afraid?
Can't these interior feelings be deceiving you?
No, i haven't deceived myself.
If you'll just call the midwife, you'll see this dreadful, destructive thing is true.
Come, my darling, and lie down.
My dear, respected mother!
I have not gone out of my mind.
The doctor told me i was pregnant.
Call the midwife.
As soon as she says it isn't so, i'll feel easy again.
Very well, i'll get her right away.
Since you're determined to make a fool of yourself, she'll say you're dreaming and not right in the head.
Young blood, and the cunning of the world!
I've known such cases.
No need to look further.
I can already feel the child moving.
Every young widow in your predicament claims she lived on a desert island.
- Shut up!
- Don't worry... your prince charming will be found.
I forbid you... will you please tell the truth.
Say who the father is!
I may go mad.
Go on, then!
You are contemptible.
Curse the day i gave birth to you.
I'd like to know, how nature works.
Is it possible to conceive without knowing of it?
That could not be so in your case.
No. I mean as a general rule.
Does this phenomenon exist in nature?
Apart from the virgin mary, it has happened to no other woman on earth.
And in one's sleep?
Nonsense!
How can you believe that?
I don't.
I don't know what to believe.
Don't leave me.
I don't understand it at all... let's not make things worse than they are.
You weep when you should rejoice.
One should cry when someone dies.
Here someone is about to be born, a child, a beautiful child, a handsome boy or a little sister.
You must learn to avoid evil tongues, the cackling of the world, that's all.
I once helped a young widow, a similar case.
She never showed all her children at the same time.
People said she had three.
When in fact she had four... or five!
I feel better.
Please leave now.
The colonel wishes that, under the circumstances, the marquise will leave his house.
He sends her herewith all the papers concerning her property, and hopes that god will spare him the misery of seeing her again.
Your mother.
Dictated.
He dictated it... father!
Open up.
I beg you.
By all the saints, i am innocent.
He does not want to see you.
My dear brother.
My beloved father!
Get out of here!
Father! Listen to me!
Lord of my life!
I deeply regret to have frightened you.
Go and claim the children.
She must leave them with us.
We have no right to do that.
Please avoid a violent scene in our house.
Go get them!
My sister, on father's orders, i want the children.
These children?
Tell your cruel father he can put a bullet through me before he takes my children.
Having learned how strong she was through this courageous effort, she was able to raise herself out of the deep abyss into which fate had cast her.
Her reason had been strong enough not to crack under the strain of her uncanny situation, and now bowed to the holy and inscrutable laws of the universe.
I know it is impossible to persuade my family of my innocence.
I know that i must resign myself to it, if i don't want to be destroyed.
I have decided to withdraw into myself entirely, to concentrate all my energies on the education of my two children.
As for god's great gift of a third child, i will lavish it with all my motherly love.
One thought i cannot endure, what if this young being conceived in the purest innocence should bear a stigma in society?
I am mad!
How can i tie myself to a man who took advantage of me?
He is the scum of the earth.
Wherever i imagine he is, he could only have sprung from the blackest and filthiest mire where he belongs.
The... undersigned... declares... count!
What! Back already?
As i hoped for, i was able to avoid going on to constantinople.
How is your wife, and the marquise?
Forgive me. Urgent business compels me to leave.
My son will keep you company.
I would like to see the marquise.
Do you know what occurred in this house during your absence?
The marquise, my sister, is expecting a child.
She swears that since the death of her husband no man has touched her.
She has no idea how she became pregnant.
She insists on that!
Since she has dishonoured our family, my father has forbidden her to enter this house.
He refuses to see her.
She is at her country house.
Why were obstacles put in my way?
Had we been married, we should have been spared all this shame and suffering.
Are you mad enough to still want to marry the wretch?
She's far more worthy than those who condemn her.
I have absolute confidence in her innocence.
I'm going to see her to renew my proposal.
Please announce me to the marquise.
The marquise is home to no one.
Does this ban for strangers also apply to a friend of the house?
I know of no exception.
- You're not the count?
- No.
In that case i'll stay at the inn and announce myself by letter.
The count!
Where have you come from?
Is it possible?
From your parents' house.
I came through a back gate.
I felt sure you would forgive me.
Were you not told, at my father's house?
Everything, my beloved.
But i'm sure of your innocence.
What!
And you still came?
In spite of everyone, in spite of your family, in spite even of your lovely self.
Leave!
I'm as sure, julietta, as if i was all-knowing, and my soul dwelled in your bosom.
Leave me!
I'm here to repeat my proposal.
I'll be the happiest of men if you will grant me your hand.
Leave at once.
I command you to leave.
Darling, my beloved... did you hear me?
Only let me whisper one secret to you...!
I won't hear a word.
Good evening.
Was your mission successful?
No.
I've decided to write to her.
I'll soon have the whole thing cleared up.
Count!
I regret to see that your passion has robbed you of your senses.
You should know that the marquise is about to choose someone else.
The undersigned declares that, without her knowing how, she became pregnant.
The father of the child... do you think the man will appear?
Without a doubt.
Now i know what i have to do.
I hope to see you again soon.
I would be delighted.
From the colonel.
What on earth do you make of it?
She is innocent!
What do you mean, innocent?
She did it in her sleep.
In her sleep!
And such a terrible thing could... idiot!
I no longer have a daughter.
When the next issue appeared...
"if the marquise of o
"will be, on the 3rd, at 11 a.m.,
"in the house of her father, the governor,
"the man she is looking for will appear
"to throw himself at her feet".
Tell me, in god's name, what do you make of it?
The vile creature!
The cunning hypocrite!
Ten times the shamelessness of a bitch, added to ten times the slyness of a fox, would not match hers!
Such an innocent face!
The eyes of a cherub!
But if it's a trick, what can she hope to gain by it?
Gain by it?
She wants to carry her pretence to the end.
She already knows by heart the fable that she and "he"... will recite to us on the 3rd at 11 a.m.
"Dear child", I am supposed to say,
"I didn't know..."
"you have my blessing.
Come back to us".
There'll be a bullet for the man who comes through my door on the 3rd.
So i had better have my servants throw him out.
If i had to choose between these two incredibilities, i'd rather believe in some mysterious action of fate than in the infamy of a daughter, who up till now has been so perfect.
Pray, be quiet.
I can't stand to hear one more word of it.
A few days later, the governor received a letter from the marquise.
"Respected father,
"as you have closed your door to me,
"i humbly request
"that the man who presents himself on the 3rd
"be sent on
"to my house".
Actually, she's not asking to be forgiven!
So if the whole thing is a deception, what would be her motives?
Lorenzo?
I have an idea.
Will you allow me to go to the countryside for a few days?
I'll find out if the man who answered her anonymously in the paper, is in fact known to her.
I'll put her in a situation where she'll betray herself.
I want nothing to do with her.
I forbid you to communicate in any way with her.
Leopardo, you'll harness the horses tomorrow morning and take me to the countryside.
No one must know of this trip.
Not even the governor.
Yes, madame.
For your silence.
The marquise's orders are that no one may enter.
I know her orders.
Go tell the marquise that the colonel's wife is here.
It is a waste of time, madame.
The marquise wishes to speak to no one in the whole world.
I am her mother.
Hurry! Go!
My daughter!
Dearest mother.
To what great fortune do i owe the priceless joy of your visit?
I am here because of the brutal way we closed our door to you.
To beg forgiveness.
Forgiveness?
Yes, forgiveness.
When we saw in the newspaper that your announcement had been answered, your father and i were convinced of your innocence.
But i must also tell you that the man in question, much to our great and pleasant surprise, came in person yesterday to our house.
Who appeared?
Which man came "in person"?
The very author of the reply.
The one to who your plea was addressed.
But who is he?
Who is he?
I leave it up to you to guess.
Imagine that yesterday, as we were having tea, reading the answer in the paper, a man we all know very well rushed into the room in a wild despair, threw himself at your father's feet, then at mine.
Knowing not what to make of it, we urged him to speak.
He told us his conscience gave him no rest, that he was the scoundrel who took advantage of the marquise.
He must know how his crime was judged and if vengeance on him was demanded, he had come to surrender himself.
Who was it?
Who? Who?
Just tell me who it was?
As i told you, a young man, well-mannered, someone whom we would never have thought capable of such a despicable action.
Don't be alarmed, my daughter, if i tell you he is of low birth and has none of the qualifications to be your husband.
Just the same, dear mother.
He can't be entirely unworthy since he threw himself at your feet before mine.
But who is he?
Won't you tell me?
Well...!
It was leopardo, our footman.
As you may have noticed, i brought him with me to introduce to you as your bridegroom.
What are you afraid of?
Have you any reason to doubt he is the one?
How, where, when?
He will reveal that only to you.
Shame and love, he said, made it impossible to talk to anyone else but you.
If you will, let's go to the anteroom, where, with a beating heart, he awaits you.
See if his dark secret can be pried from him.
Oh, god!
The night the garrison was taken, he was there, when i was given a sleeping-draught.
He was staring at me.
That's who it was!
Why didn't i think of it myself?
It had to be him!
That villain!
That foul creature!
I beg you, don't let him in!
Oh, my daughter!
Oh my wonderful daughter!
And oh your contemptible mother!
What's the matter, mother?
I want you to know, you, who are purer than the angels, that nothing of what i told you is true.
My soul is so corrupt that such innocence as radiates from your person, did not seem possible.
I needed to play this shameful trick in order to convince myself.
Dearest mother!
No, i will not budge until you say that you forgive my vicious behaviour.
Oh you saintly person.
I, forgive you?
Mother, stand up. I beg you.
First tell me if you can ever love me and respect me as you used to.
Blessed mother, the love i feel for you never left my heart.
How could anyone believe me, when the circumstances were so strange?
I am so happy that you are convinced of my innocence now.
From now on... i'll wait on your hand and foot, my dearest one.
You must have the child in our house.
For as long as i live, i'll never abandon you again.
I defy the whole world, your shame will become my honour, if you will think well of me again.
He's handsome!
- Pity it wasn't he!
- Oh, mother.
Maybe it was he!
I'm joking.
Do not make jokes!
Who knows who'll finally show up at our house on the 3rd at 11.
A real st. Thomas.
Such a doubting thomas!
It took me a whole hour to convince him.
Now he is crying.
Who has most reason to cry?
You mean father?
Like a baby.
Had the tears not been running down my own cheeks... i would have laughed, as soon as i left the room.
All because of me?
And i sit here?
Don't budge.
Why did he dictate that letter tome?
If he doesn't come here and fetch you, he'll never see me again!
Mother dear!
I won't relent.
Why did he fire that pistol?
- I implore you...
- no you won't.
If he doesn't come by this evening, i'll leave with you tomorrow.
That is cruel and unfair!
Be quiet. Here he is now.
Can that be someone at the door... moaning...?
Of course.
He wants us to let him in.
Let me go!
Julietta, if you love me, stay where you are.
My dear father!
Don't budge, do you hear!
He owes you an apology.
Why must he be so violent?
And why so stubborn?
I love him. But i love you, too.
I honour him. But you too.
And if i had to choose, i'd choose you.
Oh my god!
He can't even speak!
Father!
Calm yourself.
Please.
Sit down.
It serves him right!
Now he'll be reasonable.
Leopardo, go to the kitchen.
Have a light meal prepared for the colonel.
What a face!
If the person... is at all passable, we all agree, even your brother... that you should marry him.
Everything possible must be done to ensure your happiness.
But if his extraction is so lowly that even with our financial help his position remains substantially beneath yours, we're against the marriage.
You can stay with us and we'll adopt the child.
In any case, i want to stick to my promise so the child, whatever cost to me, will have a father.
Providing he is not a real scoundrel!
Allow me to withdraw.
Perhaps things are not so bad.
A bumpkin would hardly have answered her in the newspaper.
But it's very much in the style of our gallant count!
Shut up!
The count is the one person beyond suspicion.
How dare you?
If you feel so sure.
It's not a question of "feeling", but of logical deduction.
One cannot rescue a woman and take advantage of her at the same time.
You can't fight a fire all night long and also prowl around my bed!
Whoever shows up tomorrow at 11, it cannot be the count!
The next day was the dreaded date of the 3rd... it would be more suitable if we left you alone.
No, it would be better to wait for him all together.
I have no secrets to share with this person.
I yield to your desire, dear julietta, if you want me to stay with you.
But your father's presence, or your brother's would not be right.
The count!
Bolt the door.
We are not at home to him!
Please, julietta!
Whom were we waiting for?
Surely not him!
Then whom else?
We are such idiots!
Who else but him?
I'm going out of my mind, mother!
Unhappy creature!
What more do you want?
Has anything happened that you didn't expect?
Dear, kind, gracious lady!
Get up, count, please get up!
Make her feel better.
We'll all be reconciled.
All will be forgiven and forgotten.
Go away!
Go away, away!
I was ready for some villain of a fellow, but not the... not the devil!
Call the colonel!
This man, father, i cannot marry him.
What's happened?
Don't ask questions.
This young man is sincerely sorry for what he has done.
Give him your blessing and all will end well.
May god's curse avoid his head!
When are you getting married?
Tomorrow, tomorrow, or today if you want.
The count, who has shown such eagerness to redeem his offence will prefer the earliest possible date.
Then i shall have the pleasure of seeing you tomorrow at 11 a.m.
In st. Augustine's church.
Let's see julietta.
Why is the count worse than anyone else?
Julietta... explain yourself.
I want to be alone.
Julietta! Have you forgotten?
You're going to be a mother.
I have to think of myself more than the child.
By all the angels in heaven, i won't marry him.
You must keep your word.
I'll offer him a contract:
He'll renounce all his rights as a husband, but will fulfil all his duties.
Then will you consent?
I will be tomorrow at 11, in st. Augustine's church.
Before almighty god, i take thee as my wedded wife.
Before almighty god, i take thee as my husband.
Count, i expect to see you from time at my daughter's house.
Thank you.
The count took an apartment in town where he stayed for several months, without ever setting foot in the governor's mansion.
But after their son's baptism, he was invited there regularly.
Good night.
Countess!
May i have a word with you?
Don't be afraid.
I won't beg for forgiveness or pester you.
But you should know that your contempt is the most terrible punishment, worse than death.
I love you and will endure anything for as long as you want.
I'm going now.
Good night!
I did not tell you everything about that swan.
The swan, whose image, as i laid feverish, i confused with your image.
Its name was thinka.
One day, as a child, i threw mud at it.
It dived and came up all white again, washed by the waters.
In my fever i saw you.
You were swimming on waves of fire and i shouted thinka!
I couldn't get your attention.
You were taking such pleasure in swimming around, craning your neck.
Thinka!
Julietta!
Any villain of a fellow, to comply with the fragile laws of this world, you were ready to accept.
Why then did you flee from me as if from the devil?
I would never have thought you were a devil if when i first saw you you had not seemed like an angel!
A long line of young russians followed upon the first born.
Never before in American history...
...has one family held such an enormous concentration of political power.
The plan is perfectly plain.
To return and perpetuate this power for decades.
Two terms for JFK, two for Bobby and two for Ted.
And in each administration, the brothers who are not president...
...would take over the most powerful cabinet posts.
They have several hundred million dollars...
...and some of the best brains on Earth to carry it through.
They have put together a powerful coalition of big-city machines...
Labor, Negroes, Jews, liberals...
...and the press.
- That will make him unbeatable in 1964.
Wait a minute, professor.
He's appointed Republicans to the Treasury, to the Navy.
Another's head of the CIA.
Brother Bobby worked on Joe McCarthy's committee.
The old man is farther to the right than I am.
Ancient history, Harold.
Man's come out for cuts in oil-depletion allowance.
He's stopping mergers under the Antitrust Act.
He promises to close down 52 domestic and 25 overseas military bases.
Foster, since when do you believe the promises of politicians?
- Especially in an election year?
- Times have changed, Mr. Ferguson.
And tactics along with them.
In the next few months, you're going to see JFK do the following:
One, he is going to lead the black revolution...
...instead of fighting it.
Now we all know what that means.
Damn right, a white backlash.
Federal troops backing up the blacks.
Blood in the streets.
Two, he's going to try to put across a test-ban treaty with the Russians.
Three, he's going to try to pull out of Vietnam...
...and turn Asia over to the Communists.
Ridiculous, the American public would never stand for that.
Come on, Harold.
The American public will stand for what it has to stand for.
What it's told to stand for or what it's educated to stand for.
Done effectively, the public would soon be disenchanted with the war.
Which would make action imperative.
- What kind of action?
- Executive.
I'll take it from here, Bob.
- Let's all go in the other room.
- Why in the other room?
Just a short walk. Do you good.
- Nothing wrong with my heart, James.
- He's got you there, Jim.
Tell me, sir, to what do you ascribe your great, good health?
Hard liquor and soft women.
Southern gentlemen.
This country was not made...
...by people who sat in their own community...
...and followed their own private interests.
Instead, it was made...
...by the men who recognized that change means progress.
And progress means the welfare of our people.
That's what makes this a great country.
How are you?
In Europe, heads of state always die at the hands of conspirators.
Our presidents are killed by madmen.
The pattern is remarkably consistent.
Abraham Lincoln, April 14th, 1865.
Target: Sitting and stationary.
Range: Six inches. Successful.
James Garfield, July 2nd, 1881.
Target: Walking at two-and-a-half miles per hour.
Range: Three feet. Successful.
William McKinley.
September 6th, 1901.
Target: Standing and stationary.
Range: One foot.
Successful.
Theodore Roosevelt,
October 14th, 1912.
Target: Standing and stationary.
Range: Six feet.
Wounded, survived.
Franklin D. Roosevelt,
February 15th, 1933.
Target: Sitting and stationary.
Range: 23 feet.
Five shots, five misses.
In no case was the killer an expert marksman.
In every case, the Secret Service was unprepared.
In every case, the assassin was a political fanatic...
...willing to die to get the president.
No professional can be expected to lay his life on the line for such a cause.
So we've determined that our action can best be carried out...
...during a motorcade.
- How so?
Because they're scheduled well in advance.
They give you a chance to fire from cover...
...and get away in the confusion.
- How do you select your operatives?
- I can tell you, Harold.
Now, you used to have to train your own men from the ground up.
Keep them on your payroll the rest of their lives.
No more.
Do you know many men were fired by the CIA after the Bay of Pigs fiasco?
There's a small army of anti-Castro Cubans.
They're all ready. They're all available.
And they can do anything from picking a lock...
...and bugging an embassy to taking care of an ambassador.
So...
- How many of them do you need?
- A team of three men.
I've had two teams in the field for over a month.
- Why two?
- One team will be selected for action.
The other for backup and getaway.
These are all men
I've used before, Harold.
Trained, reliable, professional.
Now, one man firing from long range at a moving target is out of the question.
Even with two, we found the percentages of failure are too high.
The only possible scenario is three rifles with triangulated fire.
Two firing at a retreating target.
And the third firing
as the target advances.
Three misses, three hits.
Take the target back.
Stand by to go again.
Start the target.
Stand by to fire.
Fire.
While there's a climate of violence
in the country now...
...in which anything can happen, the people won't protest it...
...or even fight it for fear of becoming involved.
What about the Secret Service?
They give the president less protection than any other head of state on Earth.
De Gaulle travels surrounded by 47 motorcycles.
Kennedy with eight, sometimes 10.
And none between him and the crowds on the sidewalk.
When a Soviet motorcade passes a 10-story building...
...there's a separate agent to watch each floor.
Now, in Jack's motorcades...
...the agents often travel inside of closed cars.
- They can't see a damn thing.
- And they're paid less than the FBI.
They only have target practice twice a year.
And they're often used as White House errand boys.
And most of their intelligence comes from other agencies.
Which means they get very little.
The FBI doesn't give much to anybody.
And Hoover, he doesn't like Kennedys any more than we do.
The CIA?
After the Bay of Pigs, its director and his deputy were forced to resign.
The mood of the agency may best be described as bitter.
Are you trying to tell me people in the CIA and FBI...
...are going to help with this project?
No. James, how many government intelligence agencies...
...do you have personal knowledge of?
Fifteen. Maybe 17.
And how many private companies act as fronts for American intelligence?
- Private? Maybe three or 400.
- Including six or seven of your own?
What one agency finds inconvenient to do...
...may be very simple for another one in the same area.
So you see, there aren't nearly as many secrets as an outsider might imagine.
I can see how that could happen.
Even after a man leaves the government service...
...he still has ongoing relationships...
...with the various intelligence outfits he's left behind.
Yes, I can see that too.
It's that ongoing relationship that gives him access to information.
He receives it because he's trusted.
And that's the way we receive ours.
Yes? Oh, Charlie.
Is that so?
I see.
Yes, of course that would have worked out.
- Yeah.
- Thanks very much, Charlie.
- Quite all right.
- Bye.
Bye.
A conspiracy will make us look like a banana republic.
We don't have them.
That's what we pay our intelligence agencies to prevent.
They'll deny a conspiracy down to the last man...
...lay the whole thing off...
...on some crazy damn fool who did it all on his own.
- Who is the crazy damn fool?
- He'll be provided.
Charlie McCadden just called from El Paso.
Governor Connally just left the president.
And they made a private agreement...
...that he will make a political pilgrimage to Texas to woo votes.
Probably in the fall.
There ought to be a better way of settling things like this.
Have you researched the man's private history?
- Thoroughly.
- Letters from the State Department?
Harold, if you'll forgive me...
...we're way ahead of you.
If we could find some way to discredit him...
...believe me, we would have done it by now.
Gentlemen, the hour is getting late.
Well, I'm sorry, gentlemen,
I'm still unconvinced.
I agree with you that the welfare of this country...
...is worth any man's life, even the president's.
My advice, for what it's worth to you, is wait.
I'll see you to your car.
Harold.
Harold.
Oh, before I took over
Transjordanian oil...
...my own intelligence men had to eliminate a little local opposition.
I understand these things.
I just don't like them.
They're tolerable only if they're necessary...
...and permissible only if they work.
Good day.
I was in charge of that Transjordanian operation.
The hell.
Arranged it through the German intelligence.
My technician on that job
is out there right now training Team B.
Okay, Lee, take her up.
Okay, Chris, take it up.
Okay, Jess. Take it up to 15 feet.
Hold it. That's good.
Okay, hold it. That's good.
Okay, that's good. Lock it off.
Start the action.
Fire.
I got three hits on target.
One hit on Number 2. A miss.
Seven seconds and two misses.
It's probably a kill, but we're two seconds over time...
...so we'll have to slow the target down.
With the most accurate rifle on Earth...
...we've still got a two-inch spread on either side for every hundred yards.
So at 20 miles an hour, it's too much.
Yeah.
Let's get a beer.
Commencement exercises
at American University...
... gained world significance
when President Kennedy reveals...
... two major decisions
on Western relations with Russia.
Addressing the graduates...
... Mr. Kennedy makes a stirring plea
for world peace and says:
First, Chairman Khrushchev...
...Prime Minister Macmillan and I have agreed...
...that high-level discussions will shortly begin in Moscow...
... looking towards early agreement
on a comprehensive test-ban treaty.
I now declare that the United States...
... does not propose to conduct
nuclear tests in the atmosphere...
... so long as other states
do not do so.
This generation of Americans
has already had enough...
More than enough.
- Of war and hate and oppression.
Jim, sit down.
- Are you hungry?
- Thanks, I've eaten.
How's the team?
Well, it can be done in five or six seconds...
...but only if we slow the target down to 15 miles an hour.
Otherwise, you take chances.
All right, we'll work on that.
- Any cover problems?
- No. No problems.
Supposed to be hunters and I take it that's what we actually are.
Correct.
Here's your expense money.
Say, when you gonna throw a little light on this play?
It's not quite a standard operation.
I may run as tight as you are.
You mean is that each of us knows only his own job?
Put it in any words you like.
The company must be running other teams then. Are we number one?
Two teams only...
...and there's a good chance that you'll see action.
Maybe before Thanksgiving.
How soon will we find out what the options are?
The probabilities for success are almost 100 percent.
Yeah, like the Bay of Pigs.
You're a high-risk man, you're on contract.
Your men are all experienced in black operations.
You take your chances and you get paid for it and damn well.
Okay, Jim.
I'll tell you this much.
I've never seen a better cover plan in all my life.
Every man jack will be out of the country within 36 hours.
New passports, new identities...
...plus $25,000 each just for spending money.
I like that. Tell me more.
You'll stay out of the country for two years.
You'll receive $25,000 a year via Switzerland for the next five years.
All of us?
I said every man jack involved in the operation.
And five years from now, on January 2nd, 1968...
...provided no one has broken security...
...each man will find $ 100,000...
...in his own personally numbered
Swiss bank account.
Jesus.
You just told me who we're gonna hit.
This nation was founded by men
of many nations and backgrounds.
Okay.
It was founded on the principle that men are created equal...
...and that the rights of every man are diminished...
...when the rights of one man are threatened.
My fellow Americans,
this is a problem which faces us all...
... in every city of the North
as well as the South.
Today, there are Negroes unemployed...
...two or three times as many compared to whites.
Inadequate education, moving into the large cities...
...unable to find work, denied their equal rights.
We cannot say
to 10 percent of the population...
... that "You can 't have that right.
Your children can't have the chance to develop whatever talents they have.
The only way that they'll get their rights is to go in the street and demonstrate."
I think we owe them and we owe ourselves a better country than that.
The computer threw out
14 possible goats.
Or sponsors, as we like to call them.
A young man named Lee Harvey Oswald seems the best.
Born in New Orleans, 1939.
Father dead.
Mother remarried and divorced.
Boy was in an orphanage for a while...
...then shunted about with his mother till he was 17.
You can start now, Tim.
He has remarkably muddled political record...
...that can be steered strongly to the left.
On October 24, 1956, seven days after his 17th birthday...
...subject enlisted in the United States Marine Corps.
Attended
Aviation Fundamental School...
...at Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida...
...studying basic radar theory, map reading...
...and air-traffic-control procedures.
Began studying Russian language and taking pro-Communist attitudes.
Fellow Marines called him
"Oswaldavitch" and "Russki."
In the Marine Corps?
Not a chance.
Preparing a cover for him.
- Naval Intelligence?
- Either that or CIA.
Go ahead, Tim.
Arrived in Yokosuka, Japan aboard the Bexar...
...for assignment at Atsugi,
20 miles west of Tokyo.
Isn't that where we monitored the U-2s over China?
And a lot of other stuff.
Court-martialed on June 27th...
...for pouring a drink over a non-commissioned officer's head...
...and use of insulting language.
Confined 28 days at hard labor.
Only 28 days?
Not only giving him a cover, they're fixing him a phony.
On August 17, 1959, he requested a dependency discharge...
...on the ground that his mother required his support.
- Discharge was granted September 11.
- Well, that was easy.
Easier than you think. Watch this.
To get the discharge, he needed a doctor's affidavit.
Otolaryngologist Marvin Danvers gave him one...
...saying he started treating
Oswald's mother on September 5...
...even though his letter is dated
September 3.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
On the same day, September 4...
...Oswald applied for and received a passport.
Quote, "In order to attend the Albert Schweitzer College," unquote.
Passport granted.
Good for European travel, including U.S.S.R.
Arrived in Moscow, October 16.
Ordered to leave U.S.S.R. By 8 p.m.,
October 21.
- The Russkies weren't buying.
- Slashed his wrists same day.
Taken to Botkinskaya Hospital, released a week later.
Visited U.S. Embassy on October 31.
Stated his determination to revoke American citizenship...
...and turn classified data over to the Russians.
Can find no record that embassy tried to dissuade him...
...from handing over classified material.
How much did he actually have?
Location of all bases on the West Coast...
...radio frequencies for all squadrons...
...all tactical call signs, strength of squadrons...
...number and type of aircraft in each...
...names of commanding officers...
...and the authentic code for entering and exiting...
...the ADIZ radio and radar ranges.
Jesus.
On January 4, 1960...
...Oswald receives permission to remain in the U.S.S.R. For one year.
They're beginning to buy.
On January 5, he is given 5000 rubles and assigned to work...
...at the Belorussian
Radio and Television Factory in Minsk.
They've bought.
In 1961, he writes a series of letters to the embassy...
...concerning possible return to the United States.
When was Powers shot down in that U-2?
May 1, 1960.
He was there, all right.
But I'm not sure there was any connection.
They've been spotting our U-2s for a long time.
- Thanks, Tim, I'll take it from here.
- Right, Mr. Farrington.
On March 17, he met a young lady, a graduate pharmacist.
Six weeks later, they were married.
As a result of Oswald's letters...
...the State Department informed embassy...
...that for security reasons,
Oswald should be given a passport.
There was a wrangle with the Russians about exit visas for his wife...
...but everything on our side was as smooth as silk.
The embassy issued a passport.
They lent him $435 in traveling expenses.
And he passed through Immigration
June 13th, 1962 en route to Fort Worth.
Did anyone meet them at Immigration?
A representative of the Concerned Travelers' Society...
...named Ralph P. Waterford.
To help them through customs, or so he said.
Is that name familiar?
There's a Ralph P. Waterford known in Taiwan as the secretary-general...
...for the World Campaign
Against Communism, Inc.
- Now, who would have sent him?
- God knows.
You get into that, there are so many triple-headers...
...you can't count them all. Tim.
All the intelligence agencies have files on him.
He was interviewed twice last year by the FBI that we know of.
And there's a report out that the state attorney general...
...and the Dallas district attorney...
...have got him labeled as FBI informant Number S-172.
He could be. Defecting, coming back, running into no trouble at all...
...he could be anything.
CIA, Office of Naval Intelligence, anything.
Lowest possible echelon, of course.
A few dollars here, a few there, possibly a little doubling.
Listen:
On January 27th of this year...
...he bought a mail-order
Smith & Wesson.38...
...under a phony name.
And in March he bought a mail-order
6.5 mm Mannlicher-Carcano rifle.
In May, he was distributing Fair Play for Cuba literature in Dallas.
Can we rely on a character like this?
We're not relying on him.
We're using him.
I've got someone placed very close to him.
Get a little air.
Go ahead. I wanna check the stock market, of course.
The real problem is this, James.
In two decades...
...there will be 7 billion human beings on this planet...
...most of them brown, yellow or black.
All of them hungry, all of them determined to love.
They'll swarm out of their breeding grounds into Europe and North America.
Hence Vietnam.
An all-out effort there...
...will give us control of South Asia for decades to come.
And with proper planning, we can reduce the population to 550 million...
...by the end of the century.
I know.
I've seen the data.
We sound rather like gods reading the Doomsday Book, don't we?
Well, someone has to do it.
Not only will the nations affected be better off...
...but the techniques developed there...
...can be used to reduce our own excess population:
Blacks, Puerto Ricans,
Mexican-Americans...
...poverty-prone whites and so forth.
Raise your right hand, please.
Do you swear that the statements in the application are true?
I do.
Do you swear your allegiance to the United States?
I do.
For 24-hour service, it's $2.
George Bernard Shaw
speaking as Irishman...
... summed up an approach to life:
"Other people," he said,
"see things and say, 'Why?'
But I dream of things that never were
and I say, 'Why not?"'
The problems of the world
cannot possibly be solved...
... by skeptics or cynics...
... whose horizons are limited
by the obvious realities we need...
Yes?
- Twenty-four hours?
- Not only that...
...he stated on his application that his previous passport had been lifted...
...and that he intended to travel to Russia.
He can't be just crazy on his own.
He defects, they lift his passport...
...and on 24 hours' notice he gets another one to travel back to Russia?
Somebody must be behind him.
Oh, yes, indeed.
Worth his weight in gold.
We call this our Cubanization process.
Here our sponsor distributes
Fair Play for Cuba leaflets...
...on Canal Street in New Orleans.
Who's the other man?
Picked him up in an employment office,
$2 an hour.
We've repeated this process four times in the last 10 days.
The address on the leaflets is 611 Karp Street.
Howard Grimm's building.
You remember him.
Special agent in charge of the Chicago FBI office.
We used him in '61 as equipment purchaser for our Cuban friends.
Grimm has an office in that building himself.
- Was that wise?
- Well, no matter.
Grimm's organization is on LaFollete Street.
The Anti-Communist League of the Caribbean.
I like that.
They cancel each other out.
And no one's been able to put them together yet.
I don't like it, but it's done.
- When are you him getting into Dallas?
- Not for another month.
Our New Orleans scenario calls for a street corner fight and an arrest.
Possibly some radio interviews,
TV if we're lucky.
He doesn't know he's being handled?
No.
That's being taken care of by someone who's known him for years.
- Heard anything from the old man?
- Not yet.
Go ahead without him?
Difficult to say. Very difficult.
In the meantime, we'll push on and hope that Kennedy makes up his mind for us.
Just a little water.
I still have a dream.
It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
I have a dream that one day...
...this nation will rise up...
...live out the true meaning of its creed:
We hold these truths to be self-evident...
...that all men are created equal.
I have a dream...
...that my four little children will one day live in a nation...
...where they will not be judged by the color of their skin...
...but by the content of their character.
I have a dream today.
Orders from God?
What the hell would they be sending us to Montana for?
Help fight American imperialism.
Join the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
I know you, dirty bastard.
You spy for Castro.
You came to our office of Cuban Students in Exile.
Took some material.
And here you are handing out this crap.
Why don't you go to Cuba and stay there?
Take him away now.
A full-scale nuclear exchange...
...lasting less than 60 minutes...
...with the weapons now in existence...
...could wipe out more than 300 million Americans...
...Europeans and Russians...
...as well as untold millions elsewhere.
That's why I support the test-ban treaty.
Not because we're going to be easier
in our lives...
... but because we have a chance
to avoid being burned.
The reason that I'm worried about this treaty...
...is because I believe that this treaty...
...is a step away from safety...
...possibly a step toward war.
A pact, hailed by a hopeful majority as signaling peace in our time...
...actually turns out to be a first step on the path to disaster.
This treaty is not the millennium...
... but it is an important first step.
A step towards peace.
Let history record that we,
in this land...
... at this time, took the first step.
Man's creating the perfect climate for his death.
They sometimes do, you know.
Caesar did.
In that event, what do you hear from our elderly Brutus?
Ferguson says in effect,
"Don't call me, I'll call you."
- How's yours stand-in for Brutus doing?
- Oh, he's doing fine.
Heading up a Fair Play for Cuba
Committee that doesn't exist.
Writing letters to the Communist Party in New York.
And after that street brawl...
...he demanded that an FBI man come down to see him.
When will he be in Dallas?
Between the 3rd and 5th of October.
His wife's there now, living outside of the city with a friend.
Well, why wait so long?
Well, he wants to go to Mexico City to try to get a visa to go to Cuba.
- Was that your idea?
- No.
But there's no way to stop him without making him angry with our connection.
I don't see any harm in it, do you?
The man's a genius.
He'll have the FBI watching the CIA and the CIA watching the Bureau.
Before he's through, nobody will know whose man he is.
Meanwhile, I'll schedule two live target rehearsals.
- One for each team.
- Good.
And one more thing, Robert.
When this operation is finished, it's my last.
Why, of course.
We all have our failures of nerve.
If we didn't, none of us would be worth a damn.
- George, in one, you shaded him a bit.
- Yeah, I know.
I only printed up the hits.
None of them were really far off.
Look at that. Right on target.
Beautiful.
- Front angle shot's wide open.
- It's gonna work.
Sure it is.
Okay. Now, we're supposed to be on the road before 9. Destroy these.
Tim, show them the pros and cons of that motorcade.
The most direct route from Love Field...
...to the Trade Mart, where the lunch will be...
...is either by Stemmons Freeway here...
...or Harry Hines Boulevard, which is here.
To get to the biggest crowds, however...
...the best route would be straight down to Main Street...
...down Main Street and through Dealey Plaza.
Where did you say you placed your sponsor?
Texas School Book Depository.
Elm and Houston.
- I went to work there yesterday.
- Here's the depository.
In order for the motorcade to pass it, they'd have to make a jog.
Right on Houston Street and left on Elm here...
...and then through the underpass to Stemmons Freeway.
Isn't that a long way around to nowhere?
It's the perfect place for triangulated gunfire.
A man in the records building here.
Another man in the depository.
A third man here on the grassy knoll where he has excellent cover.
They'll have to slow down to 10 to 12 miles an hour...
...to make this turnoff.
And when they've reached this point, they've walked right into the trap.
And there's no way they can get out of it.
If that's where you want the parade to go, why, that's where it will go.
I can think of a dozen arguments now...
...and a dozen people who'll listen to them.
But let me handle it.
Where will you start, in Washington?
President's there to please people, isn't he?
Businessmen, bankers, merchants, so forth.
They do the deciding on where he goes.
When it comes to those fellas, I know where the bear sits in the buckwheat.
Dealey Plaza. I'll guarantee it.
That leaves us with just one problem.
Ferguson's got to be convinced in the next week or two.
Tonight, the news from Saigon is grim indeed as riots sweep the city...
...and the government of courageous President Diem...
...hangs in the balance.
Radical students and Buddhist activists
are demonstrating in the streets...
... while government troops
battle desperately to subdue them.
In protest, another Buddhist monk
has burned himself to death.
And what is our president doing to support Diem?
This from Washington:
Is there any speedup in the withdrawal from Vietnam?
You know, when Secretary McNamara and General Taylor came back...
...they announced that we would expect to withdraw thousands of men...
...from South Vietnam before the end of the year.
Reliable sources inform us...
...that Kennedy plans to withdraw all United States forces...
...from Southeast Asia in 1965.
A vital region which will inevitably
fall to the Communists...
... should our president's
suicidal no-win policy prevail.
Yes, Robert, I can see your point.
I'm in complete agreement.
By all means, go ahead.
Page 499, verse 10.
Job.
"He shall return no more to his house...
...neither shall his place know him anymore."
- Chris.
- What?
Open up for a minute.
Jesus, I got somebody in here.
Okay, you come out here.
It'll only take a minute.
I'll be back in a minute.
- What?
- Close the door.
You got something, huh?
It's our job.
For sure?
- Start packing. Tell the boys.
- Right.
We picked up this film in New Orleans.
It's a Tv interview after he got in that hassle...
...passing out the pro-Castro leaflets.
No matter what you say, Jim...
...the point of it is you must be remembered.
Ten days from now, if they hear you described...
...they must say,
"Oh, yes, I saw him. He was here."
- Do you understand?
- I've got it.
It's equally important that we set him up planning the event.
He owns a rifle with a scope, but he's never used it.
Give him visibility in a gun shop.
We'll provide you a rifle similar to his.
We also want to see him practicing.
Can't you arrange to borrow his rifle?
That's programmed for later when we're certain he won't miss it.
Let's do some more homework.
That does not mean, however,
that I'm a Communist.
What is the difference
between the two?
There is a great deal of difference,
such as several American parties...
... in several countries are based
on Marxism, such as Ghana.
Ghana. Certain countries have characteristics of a socialist system...
...such as Great Britain with its socialized medicine.
These, then, are the differences between an outright Communist country...
...and countries which adhere to leftist or Marxist principles.
In your work
with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee...
... what are you advocating?
We advocate restoration of diplomatic trade...
...and tourists relations with Cuba.
Hi there.
Now, what can I do for you?
Well, could you drill this to mount a telescopic sight?
- Sure can.
- How soon?
I'm gonna need it any day now.
Well, be ready in a couple of days.
Fine.
What's the name?
Lee Harvey Oswald.
- Good.
- Thanks.
912 Martin Street, Irving.
Garage.
Got it. I'll let you know.
Chris.
All yours.
It's a 6.5 Mannlicher-Carcano.
Jesus Christ, the Italians stopped making this in 1941.
That's 22 years ago.
Let's go.
She's a real fine piece of weaponry, isn't she?
The Italians in World War II called it...
...the rifle that never hurt anybody on purpose.
The bolt sticks, it's got a two-stage trigger...
...and the scope is off 0.02 to the left and it has a 9.5- Inch drop.
- Well, can you adjust to it?
- Oh, sure.
I'm gonna need a hell of a lot more practice before countdown.
That's one hell of a buy, friend...
...in case you're looking for first-class transportation.
- Won't cost you an arm and a leg.
- How much?
Nineteen ninety-five.
Radio, heater, whitewalls included.
Well, if it's such a hell of a buy, why haven't you sold it?
Only been here the last couple of days.
Bullshit.
I saw this car on the lot last Monday.
What you saw here last Monday was the same model...
...but it wasn't this car.
- What did you get for it?
- Hundred dollars more than I'm asking.
Jesus. You mean you'd do that to some poor dumb Texas burr picker?
What the hell are you talking about Texas like that for?
Because if I was a doctor...
...and I wanted to give the world an enema...
...I'd stick the nozzle right here in Dallas, Texas.
Before I kick you in the ass, can you tell me a better place than Texas?
Yeah, Russia. They make a car called the Volga that would...
You Communist bastard, get out of here.
Get off my lot.
Who the hell do you think you are, anyway?
The name's Oswald. Lee Oswald.
If you ever learn how to spell, you can have a lot of fun trying to write it down.
It will come in handy at the right time, to leak to the press.
The face doesn't look enough like him to pass muster with me.
Get a picture of the sponsor himself and tip it in. Can do?
- Apple pie.
- Tim.
Give him a pistol with a holster.
And a telescopic sight for the rifle too.
- Everything in order?
- So far.
Hey, buddy, you're firing at the wrong target.
That's my target.
Hey, mister, you're firing at my target.
Hey, would you mind?
Just fire at your own.
Why don't you take a flying screw at the moon and charge it to me?
I'll be glad to, you son of a bitch.
You just tell me your name.
Lee Oswald.
0-S-W-A-L-D.
Hey, Ralph!
Outside the Dallas municipal auditorium, a large number of pickets...
...gave U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson a hot reception last night...
... when he came to give a speech
in honor of United Nations Day.
And the audience inside
wasn't a bit more friendly.
Surely, my friend,
I don't have to come from Illinois...
...to teach Texas manners, do I?
But I do hope all the pickets will come in and sit down...
Go home.
- Because I believe in the forgiveness of sin...
...and the redemption of ignorance.
Stevenson told friends that he was going to advise President Kennedy...
...not to make that forthcoming trip to Dallas...
...because of the hostile atmosphere in that city.
Do you see your position?
Yeah, behind that fence on top.
Okay, let's take her down.
"On November 22nd, the only important officials remaining in Washington...
...will be McNamara and Robert Kennedy.
The secretaries of state, treasury, interior, commerce and labor...
...will be in the air en route to Tokyo.
The president and vice president will be in Dallas."
To confuse matters and give your men as much time as possible...
...a code will be removed from the Tokyo-bound cabinet plane...
...and the Washington telephone system will suffer a temporary blackout.
- That will help.
- Secret Service are under orders...
...to stay with the president no matter what happens.
Once they get him to the hospital, they'll probably filter back.
But for at least a half-hour, you should be entirely free of them.
I'll have six men with Secret Service credentials in Dealey Plaza.
Their insignia for this trip, incidentally, is double white bars on red.
I forgot to mention that the chief of the White House detail...
...has decided to stay in Washington.
Good.
Now to the intelligence agencies.
In going through
Oswald's address book...
...our contact man came across the name and telephone number...
...of somebody called Fred Hastings.
Now, Hastings is an FBI man working out of the Dallas office.
You know him?
Oswald has his telephone number?
I was about to mention Mr. Hastings.
He's visited Mrs. Oswald once and her landlady twice...
...since the first of the month.
He knows that Oswald works in the book depository.
And we must assume he also knows...
...that the president's motorcade will pass the book depository.
Yet neither the local nor the Washington office of the FBI...
...has reported that to the Secret Service.
What about other Oswald files?
The Office of Naval Intelligence is watching him.
The CIA regularly monitors his mail.
No one has reported anything to the Secret Service.
They don't even know that Lee Harvey Oswald exists.
His name appears nowhere in their files.
Let's have a drink.
Dallas has one of the highest murder rates.
In two years, the Secret Service has established 149 threats...
...against Kennedy's life from Texas alone.
Yet they send him into hostile territory with no more protection...
...than you and I would arrange for a favorite dog.
What would you say if I told you that as of November 8...
...Secret Service files find not one individual...
...in the entire
Fort Worth-Dallas territory...
...who represents a threat to the president's security?
I'd believe it.
Also there will be no search of the buildings in Dealey Plaza.
And there will be no Secret Service men stationed in Dealey Plaza.
Not one.
Good.
The lead car will carry the chief of police, the county sheriff...
...and the two top-ranking
Secret Service agents.
It'll be a closed car.
- They won't be able to see a thing.
- Oh, well.
Soon be over.
Then there'll be...
...nothing we can call our own but death.
That small model of the barren earth...
...which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground...
...and tell sad stories of the death of kings.
The president John F. Kennedy is getting
a warm welcome here in Fort Worth...
... the third stop in his whirlwind trip
through our state.
After this meeting with the Fort Worth
Chamber of Commerce...
... the president and first lady
will fly to Dallas.
This is from one of our people in Fort Worth.
"Last night in Fort Worth, nine Secret Service agents...
...went to the Fort Worth Press Club for drinks.
Seven of the nine remained till 2 in the morning.
All three night guards left the hotel and went to the Cellar House.
Secret Service rules state that use of intoxicating liquor...
...is strictly prohibited while agents are on travel status"...
...as these agents were.
Four of the nine who violated rules last night...
...have key responsibilities in the Dallas motorcade.
Air Force Number 1,
ladies and gentlemen...
... carrying the president
of the United States.
With the seal on the side.
Beautiful sight. Beautiful sight.
Did you hear those shots?
- What are you doing here?
- It's all right.
- What happened?
- Secret Service.
Hey, you. Come here.
- Who are you?
- Hell, I work here.
- He work here too?
- Yeah.
Okay.
We have just arrived
here at Parkland Hospital.
It's hard to tell what's really going on.
People here with dazed looks
on their faces.
Police are keeping everybody out.
Very difficult to believe
this has happened.
We understand they're giving
the president blood transfusions...
... and fighting very hard
to save his life.
Word just came through on Secretary Rusk's news ticker.
The president's been shot.
Get me Defense.
Something's happened to my codebook.
Hello? Hello?
Defense Department? Is this the...?
Hello?
- Hello?
- Have you called him yet?
There's no answer, senator.
The line went dead.
I'm sorry, our lines
are temporarily out of order.
I'm sorry, our lines are out of order.
Sorry, sir, our lines
are temporarily out of order.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president is dead.
We've just been given word
that President John Kennedy is dead.
They've administered the last rites
of the Catholic Church...
... to President John F. Kennedy.
Nothing about Oswald.
Dallas police have arrested a man
whom they suspect of being involved...
... in the assassination
of President Kennedy.
He was apprehended
in the Oak Cliff area...
... after allegedly killing a policeman.
This side.
- Did you shoot the president?
- I didn't shoot anybody, no, sir.
I'm just a patsy.
I'm just a patsy.
Oh, knock it off, bub.
This wasn't in the scenario, was it, Mr. Farrington?
No scenario's perfect, Tim.
Probably realized the position he'd been placed in...
...slipped out of the depository, stopped by his room for the gun...
...and then ran into the policeman and panicked.
- Find out what's happened to him.
- Okay, Mr. Farrington.
Identified as Lee Harvey Oswald,
an employee...
I'll have to leave Dallas.
... of the Texas Book Depository
overlooking Dealey Plaza...
... where the president was shot.
So far, the police are releasing no...
It's terrible, Hymie, terrible.
No, you don't understand.
I gotta get out of this town.
I'm thinking of coming back to Chicago.
One thing I can tell you:
This case is cinched.
That this man killed the president.
There is no question in my mind about it.
Chief, can you tell us in summary...
...what directly links Oswald to the killing of the president?
Well, he was on the floor where the shots were fired from...
...immediately before the shots were fired.
He was seen carrying a package to the building.
Ballistic tests, we haven't had a final report.
But it is...
I understand will be favorable.
If we can put his prints on the rifle...
... I am certain
that we can connect him.
Are there any other suspects linked with Oswald?
No.
Thank you.
Is there any indication that this was an organized plot...
...or was it one man?
- There's no one else but him.
Stuttgart, Gate 12.
Thank you. Let's go.
Jack. Where is everybody?
The joint's closed.
Didn't you see the sign?
No, I came through the back way.
What's wrong?
What's wrong? You stupid bitch, don't you read the newspapers?
They killed Kennedy this afternoon.
Sure, I know that, Jack, but why are we closing down?
Because it looks good, that's why.
Now get out of here.
Go on home.
Okay.
Hey, wait a minute.
I gave your number to a guy.
A guy named Burger. Henry Burger.
He's a new cop.
He may get lonesome, give you a call tonight.
If he does, you fix him up, huh?
Sure, I'll fix him up.
May I bring you a drink, sir?
Drink, sir?
Yeah, vodka rocks.
I really don't know what this situation is about.
Nobody has told me anything except that I'm accused...
...of murdering a policeman.
I know nothing more than that.
I do request someone to come forward...
...to give me legal assistance.
Did you kill the president?
No. I have not been charged with that.
In fact, nobody has said that to me yet.
The first thing I heard about it...
...was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question.
How did you hurt your eye,
Mr. Oswald?
A policeman hit me.
- You okay?
- Considering I hit the wrong guy, yes.
- Here he comes.
- Here he comes.
Here comes Oswald down the hall again.
Did you buy that rifle?
Dispatches you people have been given, but I emphatically deny these charges.
- What will he tell them?
- Very little.
Police revealed no further information
since their first statement.
Sergeant Nelson, you say he was interrogated yesterday at 4:30, right?
- And again at 6:20, right?
- Yes.
And once more at 7:40.
How many hours of interrogation did that come to?
I don't rightly know, because I'm not sure when the last interrogation ended.
Was the interrogation taped or recorded?
No, sir.
Was it taken down by a stenotypist?
No, sir.
Was it taken down by a secretary in shorthand?
No, sir.
Well, has Captain Fritz had any of his notes transcribed?
- No, sir.
- Well, why not?
No, sir, didn't keep any notes.
How do you know what he said in those three interrogations?
Oh, we got a pretty good idea what he said, all right.
What time are you transferring him to the county jail tomorrow?
We haven't decided on what time yet...
...but when we do, you boys will get a break on it.
You always have. Haven't you, now?
- Wait, wait.
- Just one more question.
In Washington, a silent crowd
has gathered outside the White House...
... on this grim and somber Saturday,
maintaining a patient vigil...
... while high government officials
and ambassadors of many nations...
Stan? Jack Ruby.
Have you gotten any word when they're gonna transfer him to the county jail?
Yeah? Okay.
Why do you think
he would want to kill the president?
Was it...?
The only thing I do is take the evidence, present it to jury...
...and I don't pass on why he did it or anything else.
We're just asked to prove that he did it, which I think we have.
How many cases have you been involved in...
...where the death penalty is involved?
Since I've been district attorney...
...I've asked the death penalty in 24 cases.
- How many times have you attained it?
- Twenty-three.
There is Lee Oswald.
There is the prisoner
being led out by Captain Fritz.
He's been shot. He's been shot.
Lee Oswald has been shot.
There's the man with a...
It's absolute panic.
Absolute panic here in the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters.
Detectives have their guns drawn.
Oswald has been shot.
- Did you see it?
- No.
Get them out of the way.
Try to keep the press off.
Please clear the way.
- Stand back.
- All right.
As for what kind of charges,
I can't tell you that.
Would you be willing to say it was, with all this evidence...
That it is now beyond a reasonable doubt at all...
...that Oswald was the killer of President Kennedy?
I would say that, without any doubt, he's the killer.
The law says, beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty.
Which there's no question that he was the killer of President Kennedy.
- That case is closed in your mind.
- As far as Oswald's concerned, yes.
It's so unlikely, I don't see how anyone can believe it.
Everyone will believe it.
They wanna believe it.
They have to.
People, the government, everyone.
Even his brother?
He's the attorney general, for God's sake.
True.
But he's not thinking as attorney general tonight.
He's grieving for a murdered brother.
By the time his grief subsides, all the power will have passed.
It'll be too late.
Yes?
That's right.
Hold the body there.
Make arrangements in the morning.
That's right. Thank you. Good night.
That was Tim.
James Farrington...
...heart attack.
Parkland Hospital.

Okay, go ahead.
My name is Sidney Westerfeld.
I'm the owner of this antique tavern...
...Monmouth Valley, New York State.
I was here when this crowd really came.
We expected fifty thousand a day, and there must have been a million!
I, myself, was hungry for two days, because I couldn't get any food in.
I couldn't get out to buy any food.
I was eating cornflakes for two days!
And the kids were wonderful.
I have no kicks.
It was "sir" this and "sir" that, and...
..."thank you" this and
"thank you" that.
Nobody can complain about the kids.
This thing was too big.
It was too big for the world!
Nobody has ever seen a thing like this!
And when they see this picture in the news, over the moving pictures...
...they'll really see something!
"It's been a long time coming..."
"...because it's been a long time gone..."
"...and it appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...time. It's a long, long, long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"Turn, turn any corner."
"Hear, hear, you must hear..."
"...what the people say."
"You know that something..."
"...is going on around here."
"But surely, surely, surely..."
"...one day I'm going to have my day."
"Oh, it appears to be a long, yes it does..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...ah-ha, such a long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"Speak out, you've got to speak out..."
"...against the madness."
"You've got to speak your mind, yes, today..."
"...but don't, no, don't, don't try to get yourself elected."
"If you do, you'll have to cut your hair..."
"...and it appears to be a long, yes, it does..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...time, such a long, long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
"It's been a long time coming..."
"...it's going to be a long time gone..."
"...but you know..."
"...the darkest hour..."
"...the darkest phase, is always just before the dawn..."
"...and it appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long..."
"...appears to be a long time..."
"...such a long, long, long, long time..."
"...before the dawn."
Hey, Mike, what's the worst part of running one of these things?
The worst part?
What's the worst part of running one?
I don't know.
You dig it all?
I guess the biggest hassle is dealing with politics. You know.
Is there a lot of politics involved?
You mean with the cities?
And you got that solved?
Well, it looks that way.
How long did it take you to put it together. Two, three months?
Uh, been working on it for about nine months.
Nine months! Full time?
Are you in charge of the whole thing?
Yes.
But you got backers?
Partners and backers.
Where are you going to go from here?
I mean, are you going to do another one?
If it works.
Aw, you're really good tonight!
You know...
...this is the most outrageous spectacle
I've ever witnessed. Ever!
There's only one thing I wish.
I sure have to pee!
And there just is nowhere to go!
I believe we're "GOING UP THE
COUNTRY" a little bit right now.
"I'm going up the country, baby, don't you want to go?"
"I'm going up the country, baby, don't you want to go?"
"I'm going to someplace, where I've never been before."
"I'm going, I'm going, where the water tastes like wine."
"I'm going where the water tastes like wine."
"We can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time."
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."
"I'm going to leave this city.
Got to get away."
"All this fussing and fighting, man, you know I sure can't stay."
"Now, baby, pack your leaving trunk.
You know we've got to leave today."
"Just exactly where we're going, I cannot say..."
"...but we might even leave the U.S.A."
"Because it's a brand new game and I want to play."
"No use in your running or screaming and crying..."
"...because you've got a home as long as I've got mine."
"If you smile at me,
I will understand..."
"...because that is something everybody, everywhere does in the same way."
"I can't see why you called a friend from the other side."
"There's just one thing
I've got to know..."
"...can you tell me who I am?"
"Say, can I have some of your purple berries?"
"Yes, I've been eating them six or seven weeks now."
"Haven't got sick once, probably keep us both alive."
"Wooden ships on the water..."
"...very free, easy, easy."
"You know, the way it's supposed to be."
"Silver people on the shoreline, let us be."
"Talking about very free and easy."
"All the ships that watch as you die..."
"...all they can do is echo your anguished cry."
"Still I go keep on feeling, why?"
"We are leaving. You don't need us."
What do you think?
Well, what could I think?
We're in the middle of the, of the situation and we make the best of it.
It's about all we can do.
We were standing on the curbs watching them come in, uh, last night.
All the townspeople.
It was just like a, an army invading a town. It's hard to believe.
Do you live here?
No, we're here for a vacation.
Are you having one?
We did, up until last night.
They kept us up for a while.
Who is they?
Freaks.
Is that what you call yourselves?
Sure.
Why?
Well, because that's what everybody else calls us.
What do you call yourself that for?
Because we admit it. Compared to everybody else, we're freaks.
I don't think you are. As long as you behave yourself, there's nothing wrong.
I'm not putting bad connotations on the word "freak", you know. I'm just...
Don't you think that the word "freak" itself has a bad connotation?
It's whatever you think about it.
Last time we saw anything like this was at the Rose Bowl Parade last New Year's.
That's right.
Like four ice cubes out of the bag, you know.
They wanted to buy four ice cubes?
Yeah, right.
I don't know, what can you charge them for ice cubes? You know.
It's a great shot in the arm to Sullivan
County, business-wise.
Something we needed.
As far as whether it will leave a favorable effect later, besides money...
...we'll know when the festival is over.
Uh, they're beautiful people.
Well is this festival affecting you in any way?
Well, it's kind of overwhelming us.
Put it this way.
In what way?
Just to take care of, to try to get the people fed,
I would say is one of the main objectives here.
I know all these young fellows here, they've got to be fed and they're going to get hungry.
I hope that they can bring enough supplies in for, for...
That seems to be the big trouble.
And traffic, that's... well, you know yourself without me telling you.
What's it done for business?
Oh, come on.
What's it done?
Increased it about what?
As much as you can do.
Put it this way. And more.
I'll say one thing for the young people.
They've been very nice.
All of them. So far.
It's really amazing. Yet it looks like some kind of Biblical, epochal...
...unbelievable scene!
They're all, you know, like all...
You see these cars, they're strewn on the sides of the roads from the helicopters and...
...in all different angles, you know. They look like jackstraws and stuff like that.
There is this continual flow of people just riding the stream.
They're going along and it...
Jerry, it was all frozen.
So let's enjoy. It was all I could get.
Well, I mean, I mean, from a practical point of view, what do you think, how could they limit this crowd?
They didn't want this many people here, really, I don't think.
So you find the control points at the beginning of the highways...
...and those with tickets are allowed in and those without tickets are not.
You have to have some control.
You know, when you have man-eating...
...Barabunda ants coming over a hill in South America...
...they want to cut them off and stop them from coming. They make a ditch...
...they put oil in the ditch and they make a flame.
Now I'm not saying they should put up flames to stop the people...
...but there has to be some way of stopping the influx of humanity.
Uh, in numbers, tell me, how many do you expect?
Two hundred thousand.
Two hundred thousand people here over the three days?
Where will you put them?
We have contracted for land surrounding the area...
...setting up camp grounds, water facilities, toilets, electric, food.
What does it cost to put one of these things together?
A fortune.
And I suppose the returns will also be good.
Yeah, we'll probably... I don't, I don't know what the returns will come up to...
...up to what it's cost or not, but...
...the point is that it's happening.
A couple of million dollars.
In other words, you have to make two million dollars to break even?
Well, if we're going to break even.
Huh, you know.
The point is that it's happened and it's working...
...and it's enough for now.
What is it that musicians have?
Are you a musician yourself?
What is it the musicians have that they can communicate so well to the kids?
Music!
I mean, they've always had music.
Music has always been a major form of communication.
Only now the lyrics and the type of music is a little bit...
...more involved in society than it was.
I need something now, let me tell you, to kind of run as a voice over... when I'm showing this music on...
If you could, if you could tell me...
...that I can run your voice over while this music is playing...
...what the music is saying, kind of, you know, what that's about.
It's about what's happening now...
...and if you listen to the lyrics and you listen to the, to the rhythm...
...and, and what's in the music...
...then you'll know what's, what's going on with the culture.
I've got to split.
Can we count on you?
Great, groovy. Thanks.
I'd like... Mike hangs out here.
I'd like to see a little bit of him.
Just natural sound, while he's getting harassed and bugged. Okay?
Now, goddamnit, I was going to call you last week!
That means you've got to call me and
I've got to get that thing into the air.
Now I'm going to order a five-passenger helicopter.
I'm really scared the roads are going to get jammed up.
If anybody wants anymore rooms...
...shows up with more people than they're supposed to have...
...tell them they can drop back fifteen yards and punt!
They've got about as much chance as a snow ball in hell...
...of getting a room closer than Middletown.
There's a Holiday Inn in
Middletown, New York.
Let's clear the road, please!
Peel back, peel back there!
Let them through.
Everything has room to flow here.
Please walk...
...on the grass.
Walk on the sides of the road if you're going to walk through here. Let's go.
How is it out there?
We apologize for the, uh, noise of the choppity-choppy, but...
...it seems there are a few cars blocking the road, so we're flying everybody in.
I almost made the worst pun in the world about high musicians, but we'll skip that.
You know Artie? Artie Kornfeld.
How you doing, man?
Good to see you, man.
Glad you could make the party.
It's going beautifully, man.
Wouldn't have it any other way.
It's really together.
Look at the way...
It really worked out nice, didn't it?
Looks fantastic!
The vibes are so beautiful.
Everybody helps everybody.
Today it feels so great right here, you know?
How can I ever live on the east side of Manhattan after this scene?
Yeah, man, it smells like strawberries!
It's perfume! Oh, it is!
"Just Like A Woman"...
...and "Let's Get Stoned."
We're in sync, but you can't hear a fucking thing...
...because of the fucking helicopters, so I'm going to quit!
Because of the fucking helicopters...
...I can't get a fucking piece of dialogue at all, man.
I'm hanging around blowing my brains out!
We're getting it tied up.
Two or three of the groups are in.
We're just trying to match up two groups and equipment and we'll be okay.
Can those of you in the back hear well?
Raise your hands please.
It's all right? Thank you.
Marijuana! Exhibit A.
Look at all those people!
The Daily News, in rather large headlines, still costing ten cents...
..."TRAFFIC UP TIGHT AT HIPPIE FEST."
See, if you see the, show the picture in India...
...they won't believe this is taken in America.
Because their impression of American children...
...and American ways is completely different.
All neatly dressed, put on hat and tie and sitting on chairs.
That's not like this at all.
Wheat Germ, Holly has your bag with your medicine.
Please meet at the information booth as soon as you can, please.
Helen Savage, please call your father at the Motel Glory in Woodridge.
The warning that I've received you might take it...
...with however many grains of salt you wish...
...that the brown acid that is circulating around is not specifically too good.
It is suggested that you stay away from that...
...but it's your own trip, so be my guest.
Please be advised there is a warning on the one, okay?
Sam, can you get the monitors on?
Get some more guys over here.
This is going to be the heavy side.
Richard Boch, get back to Eddie
Kramer in the sound truck.
- Watch your fingers right up there!
- Hold it.
Mr. Richie Havens!
"Hey, look-a yonder, tell me what's that you see..."
"...marching to the fields of concord?"
"Looks like Handsome Johnny, with his flintlock in his hand..."
"...marching to the Concord war."
"...hey, marching to the Concord war."
"Hey, look-a yonder, tell me what's that you see..."
"...marching to the fields of Dunkirk?"
"Looks like Handsome Johnny with a carbine in his hand..."
"...marching to the Dunkirk war."
"Hey, marching to the Dunkirk war."
"Hey, look-a yonder, tell me what's that you see..."
"...marching to the fields of Korea?"
"Looks like Handsome Johnny with his M-1 in his hand..."
"...marching to the Korean war."
"Hey, marching to the Korean war."
"Still marching, still marching, still marching."
"It's a long, hard road..."
"...that he fought so we'll be free."
"That he fought, we'll be free.
Yeah, free!"
"Hey, look-a yonder, tell me what's that you see..."
"...marching to the fields of Birmingham?"
"Looks like Handsome Johnny with his hand rolled in a fist..."
"...marching to the Birmingham war."
"Hey, marching to the Birmingham war."
"Hey, what's the use of singing this song?"
"Some of you are not even listening."
"Tell me what it is we've got to do?"
"Wait for the bombs to start whistling?"
"Wait for the blitz to start blitzing?"
"Here comes a hydrogen bomb..."
"...and here comes a guided missile."
"Here comes a hydrogen bomb..."
"...I cannot hear it whistle!"
"I can almost hear its whistle, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
There are a hundred million songs going to be sung tonight.
All of them are going to be singing about the same thing...
...which I hope everybody who came, came to hear, really.
And it's all about you, actually.
And me and everybody around this stage and everybody that hasn't gotten here.
And the people who are going to read about you tomorrow.
And how really groovy you were.
All over the world.
If you can dig where that's at.
That's really where it's really at.
Guitar mike, please.
"Freedom! Freedom!"
"Sometimes I feel like a motherless child..."
"...a long way from home."
"Yeah, yeah, Lord..."
"...singing freedom! Freedom!"
"Sometimes I feel like
I'm almost gone..."
"...a long, long, long way, way from home."
"Clap your hands!"
"I've got a telephone in my bosom..."
"...and I can call him up from my heart."
"I've got a telephone in my bosom..."
"...and I can call him up from my heart..."
"...when I need my brother!"
"When I need my father! "
"Mother!"
"Sister!"
"When I need my brother!"
"Brother! Hey! Mother! "
"Mr. Richie Havens."
What better way to start than with the beautiful "Richie Havens."
It's worth it.
Just to see the lights go on last night, man!
Just to see the people stand up, man, it makes it worth it.
I mean, I feel there will be people, you know...
...there are people out there that really don't dig it.
Very few of them.
But you know, it really is to the point where it's just a family, man.
All box office people please go to the main box office.
We don't need it any more.
Somebody unplugged the lines, man.
Let's have a hot mike.
Number two, number three.
You are not giving the world's greatest three day freebee!
Okay, there's only one way to do it.
There's a way to do it, man.
There is no way.
The only way to do it is to get into a rap with...
It's okay. Come here. Come here.
This is one thing I was going to wait a while before we talked about it.
But maybe we'll talk about it now so you can think about it.
It's a free concert from now on!
That doesn't mean that anything goes.
What that means is...
...we're going to put the music up here for free.
What it means is that the people who are backing this thing...
...who put up the money for it, are going to take a bit of a bath.
A big bath. There's no hype, that's true. They're going to get hurt.
But what it means is that these people have it in their heads...
...that your welfare is a hell of a lot more important...
...and so is the music, than a dollar.
Look, when they hook the electricity up, a great jolt runs all the way through here.
If you've got the ticket, you disconnect the circuit and...
...otherwise you disintegrate.
Wendy and Mayar... , Maynard...
...from Fair Lawn, please meet
Jill in front of the stage.
George has a slight problem.
He broke his arm.
Oh, it's on Forty-second Street. Tiny Tim used to sing there. Did you know that?
Under the name of Robert, uh, Love.
Larry Love!
Could I get the picture, too?
Oh, yes. Toot too, too, too.
Tell me, little girl, what's your name?
My name is Beth Riley, and what's yours?
My name is Hugh.
How do you do? My name is Sue.
I'll see you around.
Ah, here they come, here they come.
My name is Hugh Romney. I'm with the
Hog Farm. And I'm working on a scene.
Some people call it bum trips. I don't think there is such a thing as a bum trip.
We're working with hobo voyages.
A half an hour after we release anybody from our section...
...we turn them into doctors...
...and they care for people that were tripping like they were when they came in.
Now people have been saying that some of this acid is poison.
It's not poison, it's just bad acid.
It's manufactured poorly.
If you can find out who it is, we...
Anybody who thinks they've taken some poison, forget it.
And if you feel like experimenting, only take half a tab. Okay? Thank you.
You know, the Japanese made that motorcycle.
The Japanese affected that thing over there...
...with the yellow robes, or the Indian.
Really does a lot for the music that motorcycle.
Who's on?
A guy named Bert Sommers.
I think Timmy Hardin is going on next.
So the order of everything just went kaplooey?
You're closing tonight, honey.
Maybe there'll be a few more people here by then.
I don't like a puny gathering like this.
I'd like to sing you a song that is one of my husband, David's, favorite songs.
And let me just tell you that he is fine. And...
...and we're fine too.
And David was just shifted from the county jail...
...which is very much of a drag, to Federal prison...
...which is kind of like a big summer camp...
...after you've been in county jail long enough.
See I just, just now got a letter.
I have it with me. About the trip from the county jail. Manacles on his legs...
...and his arms manacled to his belt.
Well, I mean, it's all worth writing about.
He doesn't care, you know.
And there's only one time that...
...where the first time he felt afraid in the whole thing, was a couple of...
...I guess guards, or something, they started talking very loud.
And he started saying...
...talking about the last draft case that they had been through...
...and "that motherfucker," and "we'll get you, motherfucker," you know?
He just prayed a little bit harder.
He wouldn't do anything anyhow, but it's not a very comfortable feeling.
But nothing has happened.
Anyway, this is, this is an organizing song.
And I'm, I was happy to find out that...
...after David had been in jail for two and a half weeks...
...he already had a very, very good hunger strike...
...going on with forty-two federal prisoners...
...none of whom were draft people.
"I dreamed I saw Joe
Hill last night..."
"...alive as you and me."
"Sez I, 'But Joe, you're ten years dead!"'
"'I never died, ' said he."
"'The copper bosses killed you, Joe!"'
"'They shot you, Joe, ' says I."
"'Takes more than guns to kill a man'..."
"Says Joe, 'I didn't die!"'
"And standing there as big as life..."
"...and smiling with his eyes."
"Says Joe, 'What they can never kill,"
"...went on to organize."'
"From San Diego up to Maine..."
"...in every mine and mill..."
"...where working men defend their rights..."
"...it's there you find Joe Hill!"
"Swing low..."
"...sweet chariot..."
"...coming to carry me home."
"Swing low..."
"...sweet chariot..."
"...coming for to carry me on home."
"Well, I looked over yonder..."
"...and what did I see..."
"...coming to carry me home?"
"Saw a band, a band of angels..."
"...were a-coming for me..."
"...coming for to carry me on home."
"Swing low..."
"...swing low, sweet chariot..."
"...coming for to carry me on home. Home!"
"See me,"
"feel me,"
"touch me,"
"heal me."
"Listening to you, I get music."
"Gazing at you, I get heat."
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."
"I get excitement at your feet."
"Right behind you, I see the millions."
"On you, I see the glory."
"From you, I get opinions."
"From you, I get the story."
"Listening to you, I get music."
"Gazing at you, I get the heat."
"Following you, I'd climb a mountain."
"I get excitement at your feet."
"From behind you, I see the millions."
"On you, I see the glory."
"From you, I get opinions."
"From you, I get the story."
"Now, I'm a-gonna raise a fuss.
Now, I'm going to raise a holler..."
"...about a-working all summer, just to try and earn a dollar."
"Well, I went to the boss, said, 'I've got a date."'
"The boss said, 'No dice, son.
You've got to work-a late."'
"Sometimes, I wonder what I'm going to do."
"There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."
"Well, my mom and poppa told me,
'Son, you've got to earn some money..."'
"'... if you want to use the car to go riding next Sunday."'
"Well, I didn't go to work.
I told the boss I was sick."
"Says they, 'You can't use the car, because you didn't work a lick."'
"Sometimes I wonder what
I'm a-gonna do."
"There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."
"I'm going to take two weeks, going to have a fine vacation."
"Going to take my problems to the United Nations."
"Well, I went to my Congressman.
He said..."
"'... l'd like to help you, son, but you're too young to vote."'
"Sometimes I wonder what I'm going to do."
"There ain't no cure for the summertime blues."
Ladies and gentlemen...
...The Who!
The word I get is that...
...maybe the best thing for everybody to do...
...unless you have a tent or some place specific to go to...
...just carve yourself out a piece of territory...
...say goodnight to your neighbor...
...and say thank you to yourself for making this the most peaceful...
...most pleasant day anybody has ever had in this kind of music.
Well, music is a thing that...
Well, you're obviously not here for the girls.
Oh, that's good, that's a basic thing, you know, like...
...there are a lot of girls here and they're probably...
...a lot freer than, you know, other places.
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of balling.
Well, you bring your own coals to Newcastle?
Are you two going together or are you just hitching together?
We've lived together for about four months, or five months.
You know, with a lot of other people.
Kind of what you'd call...
...a communal thing, or someone else would call a communal thing.
But it's just, we just live together...
...and so we just decided to come down together because we were coming here.
And like there's nothing, I mean, no definite thing about...
We're not necessarily going to be together throughout the whole thing.
So you're not particularly jealous of him?
Are you two going together?
But you two came up here together.
You like that?
Yeah, I like her.
I love her. I enjoy her.
What do you think about all this?
Well, the way I look at it...
...like I've known Jerry for what?
Four or five, six months now.
When he moved into the family group...
...that I was alr... that I already knew for quite a while...
...in that time, I got to know him real well and I learned to love him.
Like, you know, we ball and everything, but...
...it's really a pretty good thing because
I have plenty, there's plenty of freedom.
Because if we're not going together and we're not in love or anything like that...
Can you communicate with your parents?
I can communicate with them on, on one level.
Now that I've been away from home for two years.
But at first it was very rough.
Now...
...they, you know, they're beginning to mellow about it.
It's not so hard on them I'm the way I am.
But I can't really communicate to them...
...about anything that's really important because they just could not understand it.
My mother is really, she really...
...lives in a lot of pain...
...because she's sure I'm going to go to hell and there's nothing I can do...
...to tell her that there is, that it just does not exist for me.
So I, there's no communication on, on those levels.
My father was asking whether I was in a communist training camp or something...
...in, in the house that I lived in.
I could understand, you know, where he came from. Because when he...
...well, he's an immigrant, you know.
And so he came over here to better himself...
...economically and so forth, and all that other rot.
And, to make it better for me and he can't understand why I didn't play, you know...
...saying, "Why aren't you playing the game?"
"Here's all this opportunity.
Here's, here are all these things...
...which have so much value."
But they only have value to him...
...and he can't understand why they don't have value to me.
But he does have wisdom enough to know, to allow me to be who I am.
I guess he had some kind of idea in his head that...
...I will, by doing what I'm doing, learn for myself how to live.
And that's what he wants me to do, anyway.
So he, he can't understand why I am the way I am...
...but he, he very much wants me to be that way.
Because he knows that's the only thing for me.
He started his trip when he was four years old.
Really?
Nothing to do with drugs or anything?
Me, neither.
Do you think that's a cop-out or...?
I, I don't know. I, I used to be into drugs and...
...I was very heavy on drugs, but...
...now it seems like it's almost contrived.
It's like drugs and revolution and the united front and all.
You know, I'm a human being and that's all I want to be. And I don't...
...I don't want to have a mass change...
...because a mass change only brings around mass insanity.
I just want to be myself and find out, find a place where I can...
...maintain some kind of balance within myself, you know.
I'm kind of like the Hamlet trip, you know. To be or not to be.
Do you think you could ever communicate with a guy like Nixon or Westmoreland?
I hope so.
They're doing their thing, aren't they?
I don't know. It's like they, they're neurotic or psychotic or...
...having fun as they say in
Life Mag... I don't know.
They could say the same thing of you.
Yeah, right. But it's not true, because,
I, I don't need all that power, you know.
Where I can just, I can just sit here right on this roadside...
...and I, I don't have to become
President of the United States.
And I don't have to go all that way up.
I don't have to make the climb.
Because there's nothing to climb for.
It's all sitting right here.
Do you have tickets to this thing?
No.
How are you going to get in?
I don't really know.
I figured, you know, once I got here...
...l'd see whatever happens and go along with it.
It's like people that are nowhere are coming here...
...because there are people they think are somewhere...
...so everybody is really looking for, you know, for some kind of answer.
Where there isn't one.
Why would three hundred thousand...
...or a hundred and twenty thousand sixty thousand...
...seventy thousand people come to anything just because it's music?
I mean, was music all that important?
I don't really think so.
People don't know, they don't know how to live and they don't know what to do...
...and they think that if they...
...can come here they can find out.
You know, what it is...
...or how to maintain with it.
It's just like people are very lost, I think.
America leads the whole world in several ways.
Very recently, when
I was in the East...
...the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi...
...met me and asked me...
...what's happening in America?
And I said,
"America is becoming a whole."
"America is helping everybody..."
"...in the material field..."
"...but the time has come for
America to help the whole world..."
"...with spirituality, also."
"At the hop..."
"...we can rock to and fro and never let go, at the hop, hop, hop."
"When the records are playing, people eat a lot of chicken..."
"...at the hop, hop, hop."
"If you've got a little chicken, share it with your baby, at the hop, hop, hop."
"Oh, baby, hop! Let's go to the hop.
Oh, baby, let's go to the hop."
"Oh, baby, let's go to the hop!
Oh, baby, let's go to the Hop!"
"Well, let us go now. Let's go to the hop. Let's go to the hop, oh, baby!"
"Let's go to the hop, oh, baby.
Let's go to the hop."
"Go, go, let's go to the hop!
Let's go, go!"
"We will go rocking and rolling and stomping at the hop!"
"When the records are playing and the women start a-singing at the hop!"
"Oh, let's go now.
Let's go to the hop! "
"Let's go to the hop, oh baby.
Let's got to the hop, oh baby."
"Come on, let's go to the hop.
Hop!"
Ladies and gentlemen, the Sha-Na-Na!
Harold, turn up the mike.
Now, very slowly, start coming back up.
Lower the lock and pull yourself back up.
And then keep breathing as fast as you can.
Then exhale.
And relax. Then just feel the energy.
These, these are all beginning exercises of Kundalini Yoga.
Yoga means union.
It's the same energy force that drugs give you with a rush.
Right? It's, it's the same channels...
...only drugs do it for you and this way you can do it yourself.
You can do it when you want to...
...and you don't have to score to be able to do it.
All you've got to score is some clean air.
I learned it in Los Angeles.
And there was only a couple of months of clean air when I was learning it.
That's hard, too, these days.
But while there's still some clean air left, it would be groovy to...
...experiment with it like those guys who have been experimenting for...
...at least six thousand years and getting very high behind it.
The Kundalini nerve, it's called the nerve of awareness.
You can't dissect it. It's a current that runs up the center of your spine.
I don't know if any of you have ever sat down...
...and crossed your legs and smoked
DMT and watched what happens.
But what happens to me is this big thing...
...goes "uuurrrah" up my spine!
And flashes in my brain!
Well apparently, that's what is going to happen if I do this stuff and learn it.
It takes years, I guess, but this is the beginning of it.
These exercises are exercises to create...
...those channels in your body and to free your body of blocks.
The major block is your solar plexus.
That's why we're doing a lot of breath of fire.
It loosens the solar plexus.
And there are blocks in your spine and...
...back and wherever you've got blocks, to keep that energy from flowing.
Go within yourself and meditate on each breath.
Make each breath a complete breath.
And if you do it right, you'll be flashing momentarily.
Just keep up, concentrate on your breathing and hold that position.
Roll your toes forward so they point forward.
We're going to leave you with the usual thing.
Only thing I can say, as I said to so many people, this title, just about...
...puts it all into focus. It's called
"With A Little Help From My Friends."
Remember it.
"What would you do if
I sang out of tune..."
"...would you stand up and walk out on me?"
"Lend me your ears and
I'll sing you a song."
"I will try not to sing out of tune, yes."
"Oh, I'll get by..."
"...with a little help from my friends."
"Well, I never come up alive."
"Hey, there are so many ways."
"Well, I'm going back there for my friends."
"What do I do when my love is away?"
"Does it worry you to be alone?"
"Ho, no, no."
"How do I feel at the end of the day?"
"Are you sad because you're on your own?"
"I'll tell, never say it any more."
"Going to get a little help from my friends."
"I've got to buy favors for them."
"Don't bother about the love I gave."
"Help me find my way."
"Do you need anybody?"
"Oh, I need someone to love."
"Could it be anybody?"
"Oh, I need somebody..."
"...to dream about. I know her."
"Oh, I love her."
"Well, I'm going there,
I'm going there."
"Then I'm going to say that I'll know my way."
"Don't you know I care for my friends?"
"Would you believe in a love at first sight?"
"I'm sure that it happens all the time."
"You know it does."
"What do you see when you turn out the light?"
"I don't see nothing."
"I told you I get a lift, I've got to have a lift from my friends."
"Nobody cares the way I feel now."
"Oh, I sat there all alone."
"Do you need anybody?"
"Oh, Lord, I don't need anybody."
"Could it be that you're lonely?"
"Oh, Lord, I love her. I'll stand by."
"Going to dream about her, I know I am."
"Somebody said, 'Oh, I love her'."
"I've got to get my friends, I've got to get my friends to go..."
"Don't you know I said, there before your eyes...?"
"...l've got to get my friends together."
"All I've got to do is that now."
"I'm going to take them home with me now."
"You've got to get all your friends now."
"...you've got to get all your friends now."
"Nobody goes away..."
"...nobody goes away, yeah."
"You've got your friends, you've got your friends..."
"...you've got your friends, yeah."
"With a little help from my friends."
"Got to have love from my friends."
The Grease Band and myself thank you all very much, indeed.
See you again! Beautiful!
It looks like we're going to get a little bit of rain, so you better cover up.
If it does and if we should have any slight power problems...
...just cool it out. We'll sit here with you. It will be okay.
All right, everybody, just sit down, wrap yourself up.
We're going to have to ride it out.
Hold on to your neighbor, man.
Please get off those towers!
We don't need any extra weight on them!
Please move away from the towers.
The lamps might give us a problem.
Everybody who is in the back, please move back.
We have to get away from these towers.
Please move away from the towers!
Put the mike stands down on the floor.
Cover all the equipment.
Let's keep it nice and cool.
We'll be back with Country Joe in just a second as soon as we get set up.
Okay, so come on down off the towers.
Hey, if you think really hard, maybe we can stop this rain! Yeah.
Please move away from the towers.
Jody, get off the stage.
The wind is blowing this way.
Please be on this side of the towers.
Everyone in the back, please move back.
Just take it calm and easy.
I see it. Please move away from the towers.
I think the wind has run through it.
It is okay?
Give us some room. Go slowly, but move back. It will be cool.
Just move away from those towers!
We don't want one of those lamps to be blown. Please!
That's it. Everybody just help get away from the towers and clear them.
And look up, very seriously. Let's think hard to get rid of it, please.
No rain! No rain! No rain!
Keep thinking it!
Keep your eyes on those towers.
It's going to blow through.
Try and keep yourselves comfortable.
And keep an eye on the towers.
Hey, cut the power off up there, all right?
What do you want?
We're going to have to turn off some microphones for a minute.
Hang in there with us.
God bless you and watch those towers.
Let me get down with the mike.
Oh, can I talk to you a minute?
Sure. What do you want to know?
Do you like the rain?
Yes, yes. It's nice.
It, it gets you clean.
What are you thinking about?
Does, is this encouraging, or what?
Definitely not. It's great! Just a little added attraction, that's all.
You, at least, you don't have to wait for clothes to get dry.
Groovy! I dig it! I dig it!
Do you think it's coming off well with all those fuck-ups, or what?
Yes. The only, the only hassle is the mud, that's all.
Does this discourage you at all?
Or is it all right?
Mud. A drag!
I can't believe it!
Do you feel discouraged at all, or is this all right?
It's a bummer!
It's fine.
Peace, brother!
I've got something to say.
I want to know how come the Fascist pigs have been seeding the clouds?
Right! For the last hour and a half.
Going over twice with that, with all...
...with all the smoke coming out of them, seeding the clouds.
I want to know, know why that stuff is going down there.
And why doesn't the media report that stuff to the people?
You want to talk about what's happened?
I'm telling you these planes...
...come over an hour and a half and they seeded all the clouds.
This is the second time they did it today!
I don't know what they hope to prove, man.
What's going on here?
Sharon Silverstein, return home immediately.
Your father has been taken for open heart surgery.
Please stop at the information booth right away.
The first Aquarian Exposition.
The forecast for this afternoon is...
...intermittent entertainment between intermittent showers.
Somebody was saying this is the second largest city in New York.
There's been no police.
There's been no trouble.
If you check the statistics out...
...you'll find that...
...these people have lived, over three hundred thousand people...
...have lived together peacefully, loving each other...
...feeling for each other, want, needing for each other...
...and wanting to make this the experience it is.
What are they doing?
They're dropping dry, they're dropping flowers and dry clothes.
Out of that helicopter?
You said a moment ago that this wasn't the end of this festival...
...that this was a beginning.
What do you mean, a beginning?
Well, well, look at it!
This is the beginning of this kind of thing.
This culture and generation, away from the old culture and the older generation.
And you see how they function on their own.
Without cops, without guns, without clubs, without hassle.
Everybody pulls together and everybody helps each other and it works.
It's been working since we got here.
And it's going to continue working.
And no matter what happens when they go back to the city, this thing happened.
And it proves that it can happen.
That's what it's all about, you know.
That's the whole thing right there.
Mr. Kornfeld, was, was this a suc... , a financial success?
From the point of view of the fellows that put it on?
It was a financial disaster!
Why do you say that?
Well, we just opened the gates and let everybody in. It's a free festival...
...paid for by the people who put up the money...
...or the people that are going to have to pay it back?
Uh, paid for by the people who bought the tickets.
The two hundred thousand, of which I don't know how many of them got here.
No, this was paid for by, by all the people that bought it.
By all the people...
...that had the thought that put it to the point, to get us in a position...
...to just be a tool, like, like a vehicle...
...like everybody else.
Just to get it to this point.
You're in the red?
Oh? The company?
Financially? If you tried to think in those terms...
...when you're talking about something like this...
...financially, this is a disaster.
But you, you, you look so happy!
I'm very happy!
You can't buy that for anything!
Sure, this is really beautiful, man!
These people are communicating with each other.
That, that rarely happens anywhere anymore.
It has nothing to do with money.
It has nothing to do with tangible things.
You have to realize the turnabout...
...that I've gone through in the last, in the last three days.
In the last three million years that I, meaning us, all of us...
What do you mean, the turnabout in the last three days?
Just to see, just to really realize, what's really important.
The fact that, that if we can all live together and be happy...
...if you have to be afraid to walk out in the street...
...if you have to be afraid to smile at somebody...
...what kind of a way is that to go through this life?
Marijuana!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Waters, Country Joe and The Fish!
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
We're certainly delighted to be here today.
I'd like to start off my portion of the show...
...by giving you a taste of a little something we call...
...rock and soul music.
"Oh, your love is like a rainbow..."
"...your love is like a rainbow, darling. Now..."
"...your love is like a rainbow, I said..."
"...your love is like a rainbow, all around my shoulders, yeah..."
"...performing all around my shoulders."
"You know that your love is like a rainbow..."
"...falling all around my shoulders.
And I said I love you..."
"...you know I do!"
A lot of freaks!
"Coming in from London from over the Pole..."
"...flying in a big airliner..."
"...chickens flying everywhere around the plane."
"Could we ever feel much finer..."
"...coming into Los Angeles..."
"...bringing in a couple of keys?"
"Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customs Man."
"A guy with a ticket to Mexico..."
"...no, he couldn't look much stranger..."
"...walking in a hall with his things and all..."
"...smiling, said he was the Lone Ranger."
"Coming into Los Angeles..."
"...bringing in a couple of keys."
"Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customs Man."
"There's a hip woman walking on a moving block..."
"...tripping on the escalator."
"There's a man in the line, she's blowing his mind..."
"...thinking that he's already made her."
"Coming into Los Angeles..."
"...bringing in a couple of keys."
"Don't touch my bags, if you please, Mr. Customs Man."
"Coming in from London from over the Pole..."
"...flying in a big air liner..."
"...chickens flying everywhere around the plane."
"Could we ever feel much finer?"
Folk music has come a long way hasn't it, Arlo?
It used to be the walk down the road trip, you know.
It's incredible. I heard the
New York Throughway is closed.
This morning we heard they were backed down...
...on Route Seventeen with an eight hour delay!
Right. Well, the New York
State Throughway is closed.
It's incredible!
Isn't that far out?
I don't know if you,
I don't know how many...
...of you can dig how many people there are, man!
Like I was rapping to the fuzz.
Huh, can you dig it?
Man there are supposed to be a million and a half people here by tonight!
Can you dig that?
New York State Throughway is closed, man!
Yeah, it's far out, man!
Hey, man, I've just got to say...
...that you people...
...have got to be the strongest bunch of people I ever saw.
Three days, man, three days!
We just love you!
Tell them who we are.
They'll know if you just sing.
Test. Forty-nine. Sixty-five.
Hike!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome with us Crosby, Stills and Nash!
"It's getting to the point..."
"...where I'm no fun any more."
"I am sorry."
"Sometimes it hurts..."
"...so badly, I must cry out loud."
"I, I, I am lonely."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard."
"Remember what we said and did..."
"...and felt about each other."
"Oh, babe, have mercy."
"Don't let the past remind us of what we are, not now."
"I, I, I am not dreaming."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard."
"Tearing yourself away from me now."
"You are free, and I am crying."
"This does not mean I don't love you."
"I do. That's forever, baby."
"Yes, and for always."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard."
"Something inside is telling me that I've got your secret."
"Are you still listening?"
"Here is the lock and latch of the key to your heart."
"Yes, and I love you."
"I am yours, you are mine."
"You are what you are."
"You make it hard, hard..."
"...and you make it hard, you make it hard."
"Friday evening..."
"...Sunday in the afternoon..."
"...what have you got to lose?"
"Tuesday morning..."
"...please be gone. I'm tired of you."
"What have you got to lose?"
"Can I tell it like it is?"
"Listen to me, baby..."
"...it's my heart..."
"...that's a sad feeling in your heart, and that's what I am."
"I've got an answer."
"I'm going to try and play."
"What have I got to lose?"
"Please come see me..."
"...Thursdays and Saturdays."
"What have you got to lose?"
"Chestnut brown canary..."
"...ruby-throated sparrow..."
"...sing a song, don't be long, thrill me to the marrow."
"Lacy, lilting, eerie."
"Ring around the moonlight."
"Asking me, said she so free..."
"...'How can you catch the sparrow?"'
"Lacy, lilting, eerie."
"Oozing life, not lamenting."
"Change my life, make it right.
Be my lady."
Thank you. We needed that!
This is our second gig.
This is the second time...
...we've ever played in front of people, man!
We're scared shitless!
That's near enough for jazz.
I'd like to say thank you again to you.
This is a thing called
"I'm Going Home by Helicopter."
"Going home, my baby."
"My baby, baby, I'm going home."
"Baby, baby, I'm going home."
"Baby, baby, I said I'm going home."
"Going home, my baby."
"Go home, my baby."
"'Go home, baby, I'm going."
"My baby, see my baby around."
"See my baby, see my baby around."
"Love you, baby,
I feel so good tonight."
"Going home, see my baby."
"I'm going home now, see my baby."
"Oh, baby, baby, see my wife."
"Ohh! Baby, going to have more fun."
"Baby, you don't go..."
"...baby, if we don't go..."
"If you don't go..."
"...baby, we don't go.
Man, you hurt me so."
"I love my baby with the red dress on."
"I'm going to shake it on a great big doll. I'm going to have more fun."
"Go back, baby, baby, I want to be a half with you."
"I love you, baby, Lord knows I do."
"I love you, baby, God knows I do."
"We're going steady, doll, that's what we're trying to do."
"Go on, baby, I love that way you walk."
"One for the money, two for the show.
Three to get ready, and go, cat, go, go!"
"Don't you step on my blue suede shoes."
"You can do anything, baby, but lay off my blue suede shoes!"
"Well, back it up, down in front."
"I've got a baby, mean as she can be."
"Not now, my baby, don't be mean to me."
"Yeah, I'm coming on, baby.
Oh, not sitting, going home."
"Climbing on, baby. Oh, I'm not sitting, going home."
"Well, baby, I'm not sitting.
Going home."
"Well, shake up, baby, shake.
Well, shake it, baby, shake."
"Shake up, baby, shake.
Shake, baby, shake."
"Well, love you, baby.
I love the way you walk to me."
"Oh, baby, I love that way you walk."
"I'll sit you right down, knock you off your feet."
"Whoa, baby, I've got a craving."
"I love you, baby, like God knows I do."
"Take your love, baby, yeah, one more time."
"Oh, do the stomp, do the stomp."
"I gave my baby, I gave one more time."
"Yeah, you quit, I'm going to see my baby."
"I'm going home.
Home to see my ba-baby."
"Oh, baby, I played the blues for you."
"Yeah, I love you, baby, with your red dress on."
"Baby, I love you so."
"I'm going home, I'm going home."
"Love you, baby.
Love that way you walk."
"I'm going home."
"Love you, baby. I'm going home."
"Look out, baby! I'm coming to get you!
One more time! Going home! "
"Yeah, home, baby.
Going home, home to my baby."
"Going home. I'm going home.
I'm going home."
"I'm going home, home, home, my baby."
"Going home to see my mama!"
Ten Years After!
Please a warm thank you for Ten Years After!
Alright friends, now you have seen the heavy groups...
...now you will see morning maniac music.
Believe me.
It's a new dawn.
The regular guys.
Don't you get a dial tone, or anything?
Yeah, there are some toilets around here, some of those rolling outhouses...
...like they had in Newport.
You ask for somebody that doesn't exist...
...and then they don't accept the charges and they know you're okay.
You cheat the telephone company.
Oh, yeah. I'm fine, man.
We don't take the car. We walk.
It's the only way to get there.
Why? Because my mother wants to make sure I'm all right.
I'm going to call my mother and father because...
...oh, they think this is going to be like another Chicago.
Like I'm going to get my head beaten in.
They're terrified. So I'm going to call and tell them...
..."Ha-ha, I fooled you. I'm alive!"
They've got, they've, you don't even have to bother bringing your tickets...
...or anything, because they're not going to collect them.
There's no way they can.
They've got a fence that's half up...
...and there are people just sitting in that field.
It's really beautiful.
I'll try. It's like I say, really, you know how crowded it is here.
It, it's just swarming! What?
Out, out on the ground.
It was nice. We got wet.
All I miss is the bathtub.
Okay. Goodbye.
I didn't even finish dialing and they said...
It's so great in some ways and so lousy in others.
Look at the people you're meeting.
Everybody is here for one purpose.
It's ridiculous!
It's getting worse every time.
There is no water. No water, no food and no medical supplies.
Why don't we pray for rain?
They're telling everybody to go home.
They called it a disaster area.
Oh, that's rot!
They called this a disaster?
You should see, everybody's happy!
Who are you calling?
My mother.
Somebody may have noticed, or all of you may have noticed...
...a familiar colored helicopter over there.
The United States Army has lent us some medical teams...
...and giving us a hand.
They're with us, man.
They are not against us.
They're here to give us all a hand and help us.
And for that they deserve it.
There are forty-five doctors or more.
I know at least forty-five...
...who are here without pay because they dig what this is into.
Look, it's acid and shit like that.
One kid died, a heroin overdose.
Yeah, another guy died.
Run over, I believe.
The army is really doing a great job, you know.
All those guys calling them pigs and shit like that, it's not right.
They've done a good job.
Dr. Jack Maitland, please, with full suturing equipment...
...your presence is requested.
You've got a delivery to make!
Marilyn Cohen. Wherever you are, Marilyn Cohen...
...Greg wants you to meet him at the information booth...
...because he wants to marry you!
There goes Marilyn!
About how long does it take to...?
Well, before it was backed up, eight hours.
And they've been working at it and there are still some cats...
...that think they can come here for Sunday.
And they're stopping them in Monticello and all that, you know...
...so it's really getting to be a mess.
So, you know what I would do?
I would wait, because this way...
There's no gas in the gas stations.
Because this is the third largest city in the world.
So I would wait, you know?
Until when?
Until this traffic starts clearing up.
You know, like Monday morning.
I've got to be in North
Carolina Monday morning.
Oh, wow! Do you? Why? A job?
Well, like what? This has been declared a disaster area.
Because I called long distance to Buffalo...
...and asked some cats there and they said...
...it definitely has been declared a disaster area.
Is there any way to get out?
They're trying to evacuate it today.
So maybe late tonight, you know.
You know, like one.
How are they going to evacuate?
We're not sure. I think they're trying to get all the cats in the cars...
...and just direct the cars to get out.
I mean, you can try it.
I mean, like it's all up to you, man.
But if your car gets, you know...
Yeah, if you run out of gas somewhere, there's no gas in the stations.
You're screwed.
Yeah, I mean, like you'd be even more stuck on the highway...
...than you are here, because...
...at least here there are a lot of other cats.
I have to get out of here because there are just too many people!
And I can't leave because my friends will be lost.
And I can't, I can't stay here any more. It's too crowded!
We are only taking drastic emergencies.
Nobody worries. Nobody up here has any money.
You could live and eat here a week without money, so don't worry about it.
I know, but I've got to go back to California.
You can get a ride to California, too.
You know, everybody here, it's the same thing with them, you know.
You just have to dig it and live with it.
About thirty hours, at least.
Thirty hours straight? No naps?
Are you on speed?
No, I'm not on anything.
Blind faith?
Blind Faith is a groovy group.
You wouldn't believe some of the kids that come in here.
They're really spaced out. Last night, this cat, this cat comes in and says...
..."If anger is red and envy is green, what color is jealousy?"
And I mean he's really spaced out!
And you just don't go fucking people's heads up when they're spaced out!
So I said, uh, "Black, right?
Because jealousy is poison."
He says, "Yeah, but it's got to be something else than that."
And I said, "Green, because after all, jealousy is like envy."
"Except that envy is over things and jealousy is over people."
"A lot of people treat other people as, you know, things."
And he says, "Wow! Groovy!"
And he walks off and I never saw that cat!
Another cat comes up and he asks me to tell him about his wild eyes!
Did he have wild eyes?
He was speeding. Really groovy.
And all the people that come up here asking, you know...
...if we can page their freaked out friends.
I mean, like right now
I'm missing my sister.
I lost her. She was on, uh, on mesc.
And I lost her during
Richie Haven's performance.
I've got her tickets home.
I haven't seen her since.
She's all right.
Sure she is.
It's just that I'd like to see her so I can get home in time.
She's got to be back Monday for Court.
Otherwise, you know, I wouldn't care.
Otherwise, I'd probably let her hitch home.
City McGee...
...please come immediately to backstage right.
I understand your wife is having a baby.
Congratulations!
John Sebastian!
This is really a mind fucker of all times, man!
I've never seen anything like this, man!
It's Newport, right? But they owned it.
It was something else!
Just love everybody around you, and clean up a little garbage...
...on your way out and everything is going to be all right.
And Chip. My man, Chip.
Aw, you're doing so well, man.
He says to look out for the fence, too, man. You have to look after the fence.
Like the, the press can only, can only say bad things unless there ain't no fuck-ups.
And it's looking like there ain't going to be any fuck-ups.
This is going to work!
I'd like to hear a tune about...
...I guess about those discussions
I was talking about that...
...small circles of friends around living rooms...
...around pipes, when they weren't selling any papers on the street...
...and we weren't walking around this beautiful green place smoking, and...
...not being afraid.
There's a cat, and I really don't even know his name...
...but I remember that Chip said that...
...his old lady just had a baby and that made me think.
Wow, it really is a city here!
But this is, this is for you and your old lady, man! Whew!
That kid is going to be far out!
"Why must every generation think their folks are square?"
"And no matter where their heads are, they know Moms ain't there."
"Because I swore when I was small, that I'd remember when..."
"...I knew what's wrong with them, that I was smaller, then."
"I determined to remember all the cardinal rules..."
"...like sun-showers are legal grounds for skipping school."
"I know I have forgotten maybe one or two..."
"...but I hope that I recall them all before the baby is due."
"And I know he'll have a question or two..."
"...like, 'Hey, Pop, can
I go ride my zoom..."
"...that goes two hundred miles an hour..."
"...suspended on balloons?"'
"'And I can put a droplet of this new stuff on my tongue..."
"...and imagine frothing dragons while you sit and wreck your lungs?"'
"And I must be permissive..."
"...understanding the younger generation..."
"...and then I'll know that all I've learned..."
"...and then I'll know that all I've learned, my kid..."
"...then I'll know that all I've learned, my kid assumes..."
"...and all my deepest worries must be his cartoons..."
"...and still I'll try to tell him all the things I've done..."
"...relating to what he can do when he becomes a man..."
"...and still he'll stick his fingers in the fan..."
"...and, 'Hey, Pop, my girl friend is only three..."
"...she's got her own bitty phone and she's taking LSD..."
"...and now that we're best friends, she wants to give a taste to me."'
"'But what's the matter, Daddy?
How come you look so mean?"'
"'Could it be that you can't live up to your dreams?"'
No, it's not true, because we're doing it! I love you. Goodbye.
Ladies and gentlemen, John Sebastian!
Give me an "F"!
Give me a "U"!
Give me a "C"!
Give me a "K"!
What does that spell?
Fuck!
Sing it!
More! More!
Country Joe!
Sir? You live here?
I sure as hell do!
Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
I'm right here to answer them.
Have you been affected by this festival at all? In any way?
What? We lost all of our milk.
We're just trying to put together a film, to show what the whole picture was like.
You know, from all sides.
How do you feel about it?
Do you want me to explain in plain English?
A shitty mess!
Tell me, in what way?
No bathrooms.
Our hundred fifty acres.
Gone, that's all.
And we didn't rent to them.
They all trespassed, every one!
Clarence, first tell me where you want this to go.
Can I ask you a question?
Is it okay if we use your telephone?
Oh, we have none. It's out.
This is a disaster area.
We don't even have a phone.
It's been out since yesterday morning.
Water?
Water I can give you.
And I'm sorry the phone has been out, I had an emergency call.
It's a disgraceful mess, if you want to know the answer!
What, specifically, has happened to you?
My fields are all cut up.
Our second cutting of hay is going.
Our cows, the milk truck didn't get here.
The milk had to be thrown out.
May I ask you how much money you made on this, uh, four days?
I have no, no conception.
Did you make five thousand dollars? have no idea.
It's too private a question?
It's, it's not only too private,
I didn't even have a chance...
...to total up the amount of purchases we made...
...the amount of money we took in.
We just, uh, haphazardly sent it to our home...
...and had it locked up until we had a chance to sit down and count it...
...which would probably be in about, uh, two to three days.
Would you like to see it again next...?
I'd love to see it again!
You'd love to see it, though?
I can't say the farmers would.
Well, it, it's, it's a matter of opinion.
What are your feelings about the garbage?
Where there are people, there is garbage.
You, you can't stop, stop progress.
Saturday night we got word over WVOS that...
...a lot of kids in town didn't have anything to eat.
Word went out that everybody should contribute food.
We went over to the park...
...the village permitted them to camp there.
A police car went up the street here with a loud speaker...
...and told the kids to come up there.
And we fed them Saturday night and all day Sunday.
Excess stuff was taken over to the school and they flew it to the, to the site.
How do you feel about them now?
Very good. I have a nineteen-year-old myself.
He's out on the Coast, and I felt that we've got to give them a fair shake here.
If kids are hungry, you've got to feed them. I don't know...
...maybe we ought to put, we ought to put everybody on pot.
And those kids were all happy.
They were all on pot.
Well, whatever it is...
It never should have happened.
If pot makes them happy and no trouble...
...maybe we ought to put all the adults on pot!
You want a fifteen-year-old girl sleeping in the field in a tent?
What are you, out of your mind?
It never should have happened!
Do you feel bad about the kids who were killed in Vietnam?
This has nothing to do with...
It's the same thing. The same thing.
There's no comparison.
People get more excited about the kids in Monticello than they do about...
Fifteen-year-old kids sleeping in the field?
They wanted to.
They're all high on pot!
Look, maybe if pot made them peaceful, maybe we all should take pot!
I was giving them water all along the road here, right up on the bridge...
...and they were not on pot!
Very lovely children, believe me.
They were selling stuff.
There was plenty of stuff there.
There's no doubt about it.
They had hundreds of kids in that house.
If you have four hundred and fifty thousand kids...
...and you've got two or three hundred...
...they were selling these, these blue acid tablets...
...which are bad, and they were selling them.
True, but figure the law of averages.
If you took 500 adults and brought them together and had plenty of booze...
...you know what would have happened?
You didn't see any drunks.
That's right. There was no fighting.
There was nobody stealing.
We had to feed them! What the hell else was there to do?
There was nothing else to do!
Having a good time?
Very nice.
The water is nice.
We were all sitting on a tree stump over there.
And the more people got on it, the lower it got.
About a year ago, I wouldn't have believed this was the way to swim...
...but this is the way to swim!
It's the way to go all the time, actually.
Think that's going to happen?
It's got to happen!
You go walking down the street where all the cars were coming in...
...and it's just the first day, and it was just beautiful!
Everybody is free.
Everybody is talking.
Everybody is really nude.
I don't think, uh, people come here to get uptight.
They come here to dig what's going on.
And even if they don't get into a festival, it's just a groove...
...being with all the people.
You know, you realize all over the country, they're coming together.
You realize that you're not the only people in your city...
...who are doing the things you are, but they're everywhere.
We're taking over!
I think the body is beautiful.
I think skinny dipping is just beautiful if, if you want to do it, if you can do it.
Some people can't, because all their...
...their environment made them, you know, feel that it's wrong.
Even though they know in their subconscious that it's right...
...it's kind of normal and natural, but we've been made to feel that it's wrong.
Row, row, row!
"Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream..."
"...merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream."
No, I haven't done this too often before.
Get it pointed in the right direction!
Well, did I miss any big spots?
Your cheekbone.
Here?
Why don't you tell me something really interesting?
I can't, really, standing there with the microphone.
Don't worry about it. Don't let it intimidate you. It's just a microphone.
I know, but it's very intimidating.
Just tell me anything, like anybody you'd like to meet.
Oh, wow! I don't know.
What did you think about the kids?
From what I've heard from outside sources for many years...
...I was very, very much surprised.
And I'm very happy to say...
...we think the people of this country should be proud of these kids.
Notwithstanding the way they dress or the way they wear their hair.
That's their own personal business.
But their, their inner workings, their inner selves...
...their, their self-demeanor cannot be questioned.
They can't be questioned as good American citizens.
That's kind of surprising coming from a cop.
I'm not a cop. I'm a Chief of Police.
We've got one more tune for you.
It's called "Soul Sacrifice."
Ladies and gentlemen, Santana!
"I wanta, I wanta, I wanta, I wanta..."
"...take you higher."
"Baby, baby, baby, light my fire!"
"I'll take you higher."
"I wanta, I wanta, I wanta, I wanta..."
"...take you higher..."
"...take you higher..."
"...take you higher!"
"I wanta, I wanta take you higher!"
"I wanta, I wanta, wanta take you higher!"
What we would like to do is sing a song together.
Now, you see, what usually happens...
...you get a group of people that might sing...
...and for some reasons that are not unknown anymore, they won't do it.
Most of us need approval.
Most of us need to get approval from our neighbors...
...before we can actually let it all hang down, you dig?
But what is happening here...
...is a sing-along. Now, a lot of people don't like to do it...
...because they feel it might be old-fashioned.
But you must dig that it is not a fashion in the first place.
It is a feeling...
...and if it was good in the past, it's still good.
We would like to sing a song called "Higher"...
...and if we could get everybody to join in, we'd appreciate it.
"Wanta take you higher!"
"Higher!"
What I want you to do, is say "higher" and throw the peace sign up.
It will do you no harm.
Still again, some people feel that they shouldn't...
...because there are situations where you need approval...
...to get in on something that could be so good.
"I wanta take you higher!"
"Higher!"
Now, if you'll throw the peace sign up and say "higher", get everybody to do it.
There's a whole lot of people here and a whole lot of people...
...might not want to do it...
...because they can somehow get around it...
...they feel there are enough people to make up for it...
...and on and on, et cetera.
We're going to try higher again, and if we get everybody to join in...
...we'd appreciate it.
It will do you no harm.
"Yeah, I wanta take you higher!"
"Higher!"
"Way upon a hill, I'll take you higher!"
"Yeah, I'll take you higher!"
"Going to take you higher!"
"Higher!"
How are you out there?
You're staying stoned and you've got enough water...
...and you've got a place to sleep, and everything?
Good morning.
What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for four hundred thousand.
Now, it's not going to be steak and eggs, or anything...
...but it's going to be good food and we're going to get it to you.
It's not just the Hog Farm, either.
It's like the Ohio Mountain family and the Pranksters...
...and everybody else that volunteered...
...putting in their time into the free kitchens. In fact, it's everybody.
We're all feeding each other.
We must be in heaven, man!
There's always a little bit of heaven in a disaster area.
So, if you want to make it back to your campsites, we'll try and get the food to you.
Or if you stay here, we'll try and get the food to you.
Now, there's a guy up there, some hamburger guy...
...had his stand burned down last night.
But he's still got a little stuff left...
...and for you people that still believe that capitalism isn't that weird...
...you might help him out and buy a couple of hamburgers.
Okay, here it comes! Mess call!
Good morning.
Left side of the audience, stage right here...
...that wants to be fed...
...has got to slowly move it through the forest...
...to the Hog Farm where we've got about seventeen lines going, uh, to serve with.
If you start your lines going through the forest, you'll wind up...
...going into a line that will take you right to where all the food is being served.
Helen Hayman, to the front.
Jim MacLean, please go to the pink and white tent hospital as soon as possible.
And kissing builds up your mouth.
Richard Moss and Barbara, meet us at the information booth.
Cort Ritcher or Greg Hollander, go to the Ferris wheel at twelve o'clock.
Greg's sister has his medicine.
Okay, Gayle, wow!
S, i, r, i, n, c, i, o, n, e...
...meet your daddy-o at the first aid station, near the security office.
If you've got food, feed other people.
Bugsy, to the pink and white tent.
Keep feeding each other.
And if you're too tired to chew, pass it on.
We have a gentleman with us.
It's the gentleman upon whose farm we are. Mr. Max Yasgur!
Is this on?
I'm a farmer. I don't know...
I don't know how to speak to...
...twenty people at one time, let alone a crowd like this!
But I think you people have proven something to the world.
Not only to the town of Bethel, or
Sullivan County, or New York State...
...you've proven something to the world.
This is the largest group of people ever assembled in one place.
We have had no idea that there would be this size group...
...and because of that you had quite...
...a few inconveniences as far as water and food and so forth.
Your producers have done a mammoth job to see that you're taken care of.
They would enjoy a vote of thanks.
But above that, the important thing that you've proven to the world...
...is that a half a million kids...
...and I call you kids, because I have children that are older than you are...
...a half a million young people can get together...
...and have 3 days of fun and music and have nothing but fun and music.
And I, God bless you for it!
I see we meet again.
"Purple haze was in my brain."
"Lately things don't seem the same."
"I'm acting funny, but I don't know why."
"Excuse me while I kiss the sky."
"Purple haze all around."
"Don't know if I'm coming up or down."
"Am I happy or in misery?"
"Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me."
"Help me, baby. Help me, baby!"
PART II
ONCE UPON A TIME l WAS
There's only one way to deal with a Prussian:
Tread on his toes till he understands us.
There's only one way to deal with a Prussian:
Tread on his toes till he understands us.
Where are the pussies?
He means the women in the famous gallery of beauties.
Who was that?
Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia in the summer of 1871.
Rhythm,
everybody's got to dance to it...
Save me from these old women with their cream cakes and moneybags. l have belonged to youth and revolution since 1848. l succeeded against the philistines, with my own theatre and 6-hour performances, in forming a 19th century musical underground.
Only when
Niki de St. Phalle, Jim Dine,
Werner Schroeter,
Magdalena Montezuma and Ernst Fuchs produce the ''The Ring'' will l be free again.
And though it be my last wish, may you see flying over your empire from rock to sea, your eagle.
May has come, the trees are in leaf.
Whether there or here
you're feeling very queer
from morning till night... l,
Karl May, have just heard from Winnetou that in Buffalo Bill's western show
Sitting Bull was accidentally shot dead while the public roared with laughter.
Thanks to your specialised knowledge of Wagner's works you know of the unfortunate capabilities of your people.
You have lovely eyes.
You have lovely eyes. lf only they could come together soon.
He does not love me.
What a lovely pair.
Fresh water from Bavaria.
It's a rare thing.
She will hand me the glass on my last journey when all have abandoned me.
You write out the treaty of Bavaria's incorporation into the German Empire.
His Majesty is so busy.
Oh, unhappy strife that turns Germany's will against Germany itself.
He is too honest.
What do treaties mean when there is no choice?
Who does he have? Who?
Marshal! Bismarck! Annex me.
Photo please, with embrace.
Just like Hanover, Hesse etc.
What will you pay? lf you're going to do it, do it right.
And now for the proclamation:
No more politics from now on. l can't hear it anymore! l won't see anyone unless... it is my bidding.
I'll bequeath all my castles and lakes, after the violent death l shall choose for myself, to the Bavarian national trust so that the poorly endowed
Office of Historical Monuments can finish the other tasks with the income from my castles,
3 million a year, which l now intend to build for 31 million for the world and all of my friends.
They'll help to keep up the other extravagant buildings of my Wittelsbach relatives, with their success with the public.
That's his death sentence.
They'll never forgive him that.
MADAME BULYOWSKI REMEMBERS
MADAME BULYOWSKI REMEMBERS
What was he really like?
When l was in my dressing room after a private performance for the King, all alone... a lackey came in and brought me a necklace of diamonds and sapphires. l thanked him, but he said l had to thank the King in writing. l was tired so l said that l would, but he insisted l do it right away.
So l sat down and, as usual, the lackey dictated my thanks.
Whether the King knew?
Honestly, he was the most grateful spectator
I've ever had.
All sensuousness, ideals, sensibility, not a movement throughout.
That's what makes art a divine service, makes the artist a priest, and the stage a pulpit.
But l couldn't concentrate before the empty auditorium.
The contact between audience and artist was missing; the electric spark that ignites in the presence of a very large audience and springs over to a very large audience igniting the final strength.
And then l asked myself if he actually existed.
Whether this isn't our own invention, created with a business sense for our own glory.
That's all l can say about me, if you ask me about Ludwig.
HOW TWO HISTORICAL PHOTOS
OF LUDWIG AND KAINZ CAME ABOUT
HOW TWO HISTORICAL PHOTOS
OF LUDWIG AND KAINZ CAME ABOUT
You were snoring, Kainz.
Melchtal's speech again, please.
I'm tired.
- Just once more, as a favour to me. l, the King, order you.
Go and get stuffed.
All right then.
PRAYER OF A FAIRY-TALE KING
PRAYER OF A FAIRY-TALE KING
Sacred oath sworn on New Year's Eve, 1873.
In the name of the King l swear. l swear and pledge by the sacred, pure seal of the royal lily, that within the impenetrable, invulnerable balustrades that enclose the King's bed, in the course of the year which has just begun, as far as possible to resist all temptation.
And as far as it is possible, to never give in, neither in words or actions, not even in thought, and in this way cleanse myself of all imperfections inherent in human nature and thus make myself worthier of the crown
God has endowed me with. l should get out of the habit as much as possible.
Never again lower my hands, at least not before June 3rd.
Last embraces, happily without kisses.
In the name of the great King, for the last time, Richard, definitely for the last time, l will neither give in to sin or weaken,
God will help me.
Amen.
SLAUGHTERING THE KING
SLAUGHTERING THE KING l,
Johannes Lutz, son of a village schoolmaster, owe everything to the King. l am his official and should have said years ago:
Majesty, now stop, we've got no more money.
There will be an accident if you keep this up.
But l didn't say it because it wasn't in my interest.
Now it gets dangerous. lf l tender my resignation and he accepts,
I’ll be thrown out and the opposition will get in.
Now I’ve got to act.
The King will have to go, if Luitpold lets me act, and he will let me act if l help to make him regent.
So let's slaughter the King for his time has come.
But who shall do the deed?
Not even Bismarck knows the answer.
The monarchy is in danger.
We mustn't hesitate to use the Press.
The intellectuals must act too.
We'll have to arrest him.
I’m afraid there'll be some dirty washing.
I’m a scientist and we need facts.
The monarchy is in danger and the monarchy's all we have. it is our livelihood. lf I’m questioned about the King,
I’ll report everything to him.
Then we'd better talk about the weather.
Lakai Hesselschwert,
King's orders; leave for London at once to borrow money from Rothschild whatever the cost.
Impossible. I’ve been trying to borrow from the King of Naples, whatever the cost, by order of the King.
WE ARE THE PEOPLE'S CONSCIENCE
WE ARE THE PEOPLE'S CONSCIENCE
What has really happened?
The truth, of course, is out of the question.
Now nothing about homosexuality, masturbation, drugs, teeth falling out or brutality?
Our readers don't want that.
Fine, we understand.
Just report about his money squandering, we will do the rest.
So, exclusively for you,
4.5 million is the civil list, debts 1884: 7.5 million.
One year later, 14 million.
Now in 1886 he's asking for 20 million partly from houses of monarchy or by burglary if necessary.
All for castles in which he and his lackeys reign.
We have no access.
He lives alone in a world full of servants and extravagant expenses.
And what do we expect of him?
Not to build any more castles?
No more private performances at the opera?
No more paying for Wagner or Bayreuth?
Is he to move to the city?
Shall he live alone in the royal court?
Is he to leave the mountains?
You're talking about our King!
Ludwig lives for us, just as we have to live.
He lives a fairy-tale life for us.
He is our luxury.
He's just different.
He is our King!
Our King!
Do you want to kill what's best in us?
Do you want to force him to be like everyone else?
As we have to live...
Without him our happiness is lost.
We are the people's conscience.
The principle of monarchy must not be violated.
Ludwig despises dogs, dislikes children, or Hamlet, loves swans and peacocks.
Peacocks.
Think of the East, foreign workers, Turks.
He gave an opera singer costly jewellery and didn't even sleep with her.
Are there any documents on how Bavaria joined the Empire?
After all, it affects the happiness of every citizen.
What percentage are you getting?
- 30,000 a year from the Guelph fortune.
Let's focus on how he handles his lackeys, subjects, taxpayers.
He rules the country with a court of lackeys.
The nobility is powerless.
So is the Royal Family, the Church.
Crazy.
He sent a lackey riding on a donkey through the village with a sign round his neck:
''l am the King.''
Oh well, if only he was an artist.
His successor, Prince Luitpold, is the best republic.
Is that enough?
WAGNER IS DEAD
WAGNER IS DEAD
TO DROWN, TO SINK UNCONSCIOUS,
INEFFABLE DELIGHT!
Those were his uncle's coronation robes.
King Otto of Bavaria.
What's the time?
It’s early, Your Majesty, time for supper.
It’s nightfall already.
Did you see him?
He's wearing a mask because he once saw me in my socks, holding my shoes in my hand.
He'll betray me with notes from my waste basket. l can't live without him.
He's made himself indispensable.
That's a crime against the King!
Spit on Rutz three times because he was base enough to look at me, to point at me!
So you really saw animals?
Yes?
Frogs?
It’s night and everybody deceives me.
Kick that Häussler, pull his ears, bang his head on the wall, tie his hands behind his back, and three days without food.
Cabinet Secretary Ziegler requests an audience.
That social-democratic nonsense in England and America should be stopped.
Didn't you hear something?
Noises? l warn you, Hesselschwert!
Again, disgrace!
Well at last Rutz's ears should be pulled!
Cabinet Secretary Ziegler should be assassinated by bandits in Bozen, or at least given a good thrashing!
He's a part of it.
Once upon a time l was.
What time is it?
An editor got sentenced to 6 months for writing that the King was mentally sick.
My assistant, Dr. Müller, was in a strange mood.
He had to restrain himself from shouting for joy when he heard he'd been chosen to attend the King.
Medically speaking, it's certainly an impressive case. l had no choice. l was under pressure from the
Viennese psycho-analytical school of Sigmund Freud and his colleagues.
Sociology, childhood theories etc. l had to take steps to oppose them, to act quickly, purely scientifically. l had my own methods, of course.
Card-indexes, interrogations etc.
Besides, our holiday was already planned at Dr. Müller's in Franconia to take care of an inheritance matter, so Müller insisted on hurrying.
Poor Ludwig.
Who could imagine he'd end like that?
One example.
They say that in Oberammergau, shattered by the Crucifixion, he confessed:
''l, too, can see myself dying nailed to the cross, ogled, stabbed in my side, with a crown of thorns on my head.''
IN THE NAME OF THE KING
IN THE NAME OF THE KING
7 courses,
40 litres of beer,
10 bottles of champagne, for 6 people.
The gentlemen have dined on the occasion of their honourable mission.
In the name of the King... it is done.
You have come to arrest me.
It’s all just a question of money.
A few million and everything would be taken care of. l mean,
I'd like to see anyone declaring me insane then.
Including your payment Prof. Gudden, of course. l want to dupe you.
What happens if l pay?
Money's no problem for a king, is it?
Your wars cost a lot more.
I’m a conservative who's failed and you are progress.
But not for long; others will follow.
I’m a jurist, it is my nature.
In the name of the King...
Let's stop this.
Blow up all my castles, that's an order, a legacy.
Alfons, what do you think of the immortality of the soul?
You see? l can't believe that nothing remains, that nothing remains of what was.
Here's my watch, my hatpin.
The cheque to pay off my misdeeds.
Bismarck advises me to flee.
They don't understand.
I’ve nothing in common with them. l am a king.
I’ve got to return.
War Minister's orders.
Ask my uncle, the Prince Regent, if he'll leave you with me.
He knows how much l love you.
You should order me as a king, my King.
Not your King, l am the King.
Latest report from Munich:
They maintain there are red flags in the streets and that our proclamation has been published by the social democrats to confuse the people.
To keep calm, the first civic duty.
Poor Uncle Luitpold.
He has a terrible time trying to rule. l had a dream.
During a performance of the ''Twilight of the Gods,'' the audience got up.
A lady stood up, looked at me insolently, and began to sing a song impromptu.
Disgusting.
THE KING IS DEAD.
LONG LIVE THE REGENT
THE KING IS DEAD.
LONG LIVE THE REGENT
The King is dead.
Committed suicide in Lake Starnberg.
Red flags in Munich.
A socialist proclamation on the walls of the residence.
You don't really believe that.
- Majesty!
Fine, so the King went bathing and lost his kingdom.
Majesty!
According to the constitution, you are now King.
Me?
Me?
Prince Luitpold, the Prince Regent, will reign until your death, in your name.
Everybody out!
The King is dead!
Long live the King!
MAYR THE LACKEY ONCE MORE:
WHAT WOULD WE BE WITHOUT HIM
MAYR THE LACKEY ONCE MORE:
WHAT WOULD WE BE WITHOUT HIM
This is the original mask.
Actually l wanted to swear but no offence meant.
Beer, that's all l have to say.
But how could he hate beer?
In Bavaria!
He didn't know a thing about art.
Look at those fat women in Wagner's operas.
No grasp of the popular taste of the time.
But didn't we all live on him?
And not badly.
And we still do.
Listen, l knew him, that alone is enough.
Otherwise I’d have long since been forgotten.
Honestly, lackey to a modern head of state... just imagine that job!
But in those days with King Ludwig...
Hops and malt our King preserve.
Incidentally, after checking the bills it was discovered that the final total of debts was only 13 million.
The very great number of visitors to the King's castles even in the year of his death, 1886, suggested the idea of safeguarding this source of revenue, despite the immediate disposal of the furniture and so on.
Alfons Weber, who on the night before King Ludwig's death had received from him, together with some jewellery, a cheque for 25,000 gold marks, even had to give back two clasps, one of which belonged to the Treasury.
And he was paid off with 9,000 marks.
THE END OF A FAIRY-TALE KING
THE END OF A FAIRY-TALE KING
Here we go!
Quietly the day comes to an end
and the lights go out one by one
Hops and malt, our King preserve!
Just as our Saviour rose again, so he will return.
Just as our Saviour rose again, so he will return.
Our Father in Heaven, give us this day our daily nostalgia and comfort us in our homesickness and deliver us from melancholy for Thine is the madness world without end. Amen.
REQUIEM FOR A VIRGIN KING
REQUIEM FOR A VIRGIN KING
SUBTlTLES: TlTELWERK
SUPERVlSlON: ANNlE GROSSJOHANN
- There is no hope, Sire.
- We are defeated, Sire.
For twenty years, we followed you.
You marched with glory through Europe.
We cannot save Paris.
The Austrians are in Versailles.
The Cossacks are watering their horses in the Seine.
They can hear the Prussian cannon in Montmartre.
There are four nations, four armies, four fronts against us.
Abdicate.
You will be allowed to retire to the island of Elba with a personal guard.
- It is an honourable exile, Sire.
- All you can do is abdicate.
You must sign, Sire.
Why? So you all can keep the titles I gave you?
What were you before me?
Nothing. I made you.
You must abdicate, Sire.
Listen to me, Ney.
If there's anything I despise, it's ingratitude.
What can I do? What?
I sent to the Emperor of Russia for peace. He refused me.
What can we do?
What can we do? What can we do?
We can fight!
I fortify Paris. I disengage from
Austria and retreat to Italy.
We must consolidate and mobilise.
Train the recruits on the march.
There are no men to mobilise.
The army does not want Paris to suffer like Moscow did.
Wellington.
Wellington?
Why is it always Wellington?
Wellington. Are you afraid of him because he beat you in Spain?
France will not follow you.
France will follow me to the stars, if I give her another victory.
You have no choice.
You must give up the throne.
Oh, Ney. The throne?
Do you know what the throne is?
It's an overdecorated piece of furniture.
It's what's behind the throne that counts.
My brains, my ambitions, my desires, my hope, my imagination.
And above all my will.
I can't believe my ears.
You stand there waving a piece of paper crying: "Abdicate, abdicate!"
I will not! I will not!
All his men?
- When?
- This morning.
There is nothing left to do.
Sign.
Elba. Why Elba?
Marshal Marmot has surrendered to the Austrians. It was his last hope.
Soldiers -
Of my Old Guard -
After twenty years
I have come to say -
Goodbye.
France has fallen.
So remember me.
Though I love you all,
I cannot embrace you all.
With this kiss, remember me.
Goodbye, my soldiers.
Goodbye, my sons.
And goodbye, my children.
Your Majesty, the monster has escaped from Elba.
We can thank God he is mad enough to land in France.
Let us not dramatise yet.
Napoleon and his thousand men are not really dangerous... yet.
Marshal Soult, you will keep command of our troops here in Paris.
Marshal Ney...
You will be the first to confront the werewolf.
- I know you love this man.
- I did. Once.
But I will bring him back to Paris in an iron cage.
How they exaggerate all this.
The soldiers.
"In an iron cage."
Nobody asked for that.
- There's no way around.
- The way is forward.
Present!
Soldiers of the Fifth...
Do you recognise me?
If you want to kill your Emperor -
Here I am.
Fire!
Long live the Emperor!
Follow me to Grenoble.
It was the cry of injured honour that brought me back to France.
From Elba, I saw the rights of France misprized and thrown aside.
My victory is certain. My eagles will fly from steeple to steeple.
Straight?
Come then. We will show them your red head.
I have come back.
I have come back to make France happy.
- Bourbons to the compost!
- Hang the traitors!
I am France and France is me!
Napoleon has come back to us!
I will never forget your face, Ney, when you forced me to abdicate.
- I did it for France.
- I know what is good for France.
I understand you made a promise to the King. Something about a cage?
What was it exactly?
I said I would bring you back to Paris in an iron cage.
That is what I heard.
The fat king must be carried from the throne!
He has corrupted the honour of Frenchmen!
Perhaps the people will let me go -
As they let him come.
He is back! The Emperor is back!
Now France will live again!
Long live the Emperor!
- He will lead us to glory again!
- Our Emperor is back!
Home! Bring the hero home!
Goulaincourt, Molien, Molé, Fouché.
We have a small problem to solve.
When France wakes up tomorrow, it must have a government.
Drouot. Let me tell you something.
Life's most precious quality is loyalty.
And you Drouot, are a rare man, untainted and true. Will you join me?
- With all my heart, Sire.
- Thank you, Drouot.
Soult.
- I see you got my invitation.
- Yes, Sire.
I understand you are no longer the King's Minister of War.
- Obviously not, Sire.
- Obviously not, Soult.
Silence! You are to be my Chief of Staff. Accept?
- I accept, Sire.
- Good. All's well that ends well.
Madame...
Your son Ferdinand was killed when he fell off a horse at a review.
No. Musset must go. We need more conscripts and more men. Signature.
Your son was very brave and persistent in his duties.
I am sorry, Madame, that fate hasn't been more discriminating.
To my dear Prince Alexis.
I did not usurp the crown.
I found it in the gutter.
And I picked it up -
With my sword.
And it was the people, Alexis -
The people -
Who put it on my head.
He who saves a nation violates no law.
To my beloved wife.
I beg you as my wife and as daughter of Austria, my enemy. -
Please return to me my most precious possession:
My son.
To the Prince Regent, England.
You have been my most generous enemy for twenty years.
But now I want peace.
Therefore I protest the presence of Wellington...
My son is my future.
And I would rather see him dead than raised as a captive Austrian Prince.
They have declared me an enemy of humanity.
Europe has declared war against me.
Not against France, but against me.
They dignify you, Sire, by making you a nation.
Dignify? Dignify?
They deny me the decency of law.
They make it legal that any clown can kill me. Any news of Wellington?
- Still in Brussels, Sire.
- Still with old Blucher?
They started the war.
Let them bleed.
Yes, let 'em bleed. I will discuss peace over Wellington's dead body.
Marshal Soult, Sire.
It's urgent.
It's always urgent. Show him in.
The armies of Wellington and Blucher have separated, Sire.
- Separated?
- Yes, Sire.
I wonder what history will say of them?
We'll push Blucher aside and march on to Wellington.
It will be a bloody day.
- Yes, Sire.
- Oh, yes, Soult.
Everything depends on one big battle, just like at Marengo.
Thank you, Soult.
But at Marengo, I was young.
Uncle Gordon paraded his whole regiment for my inspection this morning.
So I just rode up and down and picked my fancy.
Mama, you chose such big ones.
You really are the best of my generals.
We ladies just have to follow the drum.
This season, soldiers are the fashion.
Where would society be without my boys?
- They are the salt of England.
- Scum.
Nothing but beggars and scoundrels.
Gin is the spirit of their patriotism.
Yet you expect them to die for you?
Out of duty?
I doubt if even Bonaparte could draw men to him by duty.
- Bony is not a gentleman.
- What an Englishman you are.
On a battlefield his hat is worth
50,000 men. But he's no gentleman.
When we get to Paris, let me look at
Napoleon. I will not get too near.
- Mama admires him.
- I am a bit of a Bonapartist.
Is it true, that he is a monster?
He eats laurels and drinks blood.
And when will you venture into his lair?
He hasn't given me any idea.
It all depends on...
Cross the river. Tomorrow we dry our boots in Brussels.
- God willing, Sire.
- God has nothing to do with it.
- Don't let young Hay get killed.
- An engagement?
I don't want Sarah to wear black before she's worn white.
Dickie has promised to get me a cuirassier's helmet.
- Without any blood on it.
- And one for me. With the blood.
Where will you stick your Frenchman?
- Under the right arm, sir.
- See, he has it planned.
When you meet a cuirassier, you'll be lucky to bring away your life. -
Never mind his helmet. The French will teach you the art of fighting.
Madam, by your leave.
I have never seen such a set of sprats.
- Picton can't walk in a ball room.
- But he dances well with the French.
But one dances with them in a field.
- Who's he?
- A Prussian officer.
That gentleman will spoil the dancing.
- It's Napoleon, sir...
- I know. He has crossed the border.
With all his forces.
He has come between our armies.
- Where?
- At Charleroi.
Charleroi.
- Do you wish me to stop the ball?
- No, I want no alarm.
All officers obliged to ladies will finish the dance.
Uxbridge, move the cavalry to Charleroi.
Picton, your division marches tonight.
Charleroi.
May I go with the army?
You can ask the Duke.
He allowed ladies in Spain.
We've had so little time together.
- Madeleine, a battle is no place...
- I fear I may never see you again.
What could be simpler than Charleroi?
He has humbugged me.
In a night's march, he has made us piecemeal.
He has gained a victory at the cost of bootlaces.
If Blucher stays in Belgium,
I stay too.
On that promise, Blucher would tie his men to trees if necessary.
- These four roads here...
- Quatre Bras. He'll go for them.
If we can't hold him there,
I will stop him here.
Charleroi.
By God, that man does war honour.
A field of glory is never a pretty sight.
Nevertheless, 16,000 Prussian dead.
That'll be good news in Paris.
Wellington's on the run at Quatre Bras.
He is retreating.
- Then what are you doing here?
- I came to make my report.
Why didn't you follow him?
Why didn't you pursue him?
- Where are my reinforcements?
- Don't you dare criticise me!
If Wellington's free to choose his ground, you have lost me everything.
Marshal Blucher, the sector is broken.
I have ordered a retreat.
I am seventy-two and a proud soldier.
This steel is my word.
I am too old to break it.
If Wellington runs for the coast, none of us will get home to Berlin.
I do not trust the English.
But because I have served you before. -
I have ordered the retreat to Wavre.
You may still cooperate with Wellington.
But God help us if he does not stand.
Grouchy. Gerard.
You take 30,000 men.
You take one third of my army and pursue Blucher.
Don't let them regroup or consolidate and don't let them rejoin.
But Blucher might go in ten different directions.
Blucher is not a scatter of birds.
We will find him on one road.
Enough's enough!
Let's not have any disagreements.
That only leads to disaster.
Grouchy. Gerard. You can go.
Go, go, go.
We'll beat Napoleon next time!
Blucher will win!
Blucher will turn defeat into victory!
Old Blucher. Damned good licking and rolled eighteen miles back.
So, we go, too.
I suppose in England they'll say we've been licked.
Can't help that.
- It's mad. It's all madness.
- They know what they're doing.
If Bony kicked the Prussians' arse, why are we doing all the running?
A retreating army is never in love with its commander.
A few shots from the French and they'll be themselves again.
- I like the cut of your men, Gordon.
- Forward fellows with a bayonet.
Meat and eggs from the cradle up, and a lemon a month.
All from my own acres.
I've bred 'em myself.
Some there could call me more than Colonel.
Indeed.
- That must be the whole army.
- They're still positioning, Sire.
Never interrupt your enemy when he's making a mistake. That's bad manners.
It's a bad position, Wellington.
That wood behind us is unsound.
If they push us back it'll be like a wall. The army will be cut to pieces.
There is no undergrowth there.
A battery of nine pounders...
A whole army can slip through it like rain through a grate.
It's suicidal, if you want to know.
You may be surprised to know that I saw this ground a year ago -
And I've kept it in my pocket.
Obviously, he's no student of Caesar.
He's positioned himself badly.
He has the trees at his back.
We'll give him no provocation.
Maybe he'll leave tonight.
Come on. You're nosing your way right into the pot.
There you are!
Look, keep quiet and I'll only eat half of you.
Forgive me, sir, but...
If you took the troops into confidence, they would know what they were about.
If I thought my hair knew what my brain was thinking. -
I'd shave it off and wear a wig.
Here comes old Atty.
Get to your feet.
- Your old friends, sir.
- The Enniskillen.
I hang and flog more of them than I do the rest of the army.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
A fine night, sir.
Take off your pack, sir.
- Me, sir?
- You, sir.
- Open it, sir.
- Yes, sir.
I knew something queer was scratching my back, sir.
Where did you acquire this plunder, sir?
- This, sir?
- That, sir.
No, sir.
This plunder acquired me, sir.
Do you know the penalty for plundering, sir?
- Stoppage of gin, sir?
- It's death, sir.
Sir, I have to report this little pig has lost its way. -
And I'm trying to find her relations, sir.
He knows how to defend a hopeless position. Raise him to corporal.
Play the goat next time, Paddy, and you'll be a Sergeant.
I don't know what they'll do to the enemy, but they frighten me.
Dirty night. Hard morrow.
- De Lancey.
- Yes, sir?
If I fail tomorrow -
I hope God will have mercy on me.
For nobody else will.
Why is he standing there?
What is his reason?
Has he lost his caution? There must be something I don't understand.
If only Blucher could outrun Grouchy, and give me even one corps.
All depends on the Prussians.
Why does Grouchy only do six miles a day? I do ten.
The muddy slope will help us.
They'll slither up to it.
But the roads could slow Blucher, and that'll be the end of it.
Tell him the roads are the same for everyone. True?
- True?
- Yes, Sire.
Tell him to walk faster.
You may fight your battle,
Field Marshal.
- Where is Grouchy and his men?
- He is following us step by step.
He is not between us.
- What is the time, Hay?
- It's ten to two, sir.
Muffling, I must ask you to go out once more tonight.
Oblige me with a fresh horse, sir.
I beg Marshal Blucher to come to Waterloo by one o'clock.
Don't you see, Uxbridge?
If Grouchy comes between us...
And catches the Prussians strung out on the march...
Then it would be just a matter of counting our dead.
With such a risk, dare we rely on Blucher?
We have to rely on each other, Uxbridge.
Gentlemen.
Who did you give your watch to, Hay?
Somerset, sir.
Expecting to die tomorrow?
I don't like those thoughts.
Having them sometimes makes them come true.
Get your watch back. Tomorrow I will ask you the time every five minutes.
Shall I send for Doctor Larrey?
Should I call the doctor?
No, no, no. No doctor.
What are you looking at?
What?
Get out. Out, out, out.
Everyone out.
I mustn't be sick.
I must have strength for tomorrow.
My body is dying, yet my brain is still good.
Will it never stop raining?
- We're 140,000 men.
- We're not the half of it.
That's counting the French as well.
40,000 will be dead tomorrow.
Eat your soup while you've got your belly.
Have you seen our new Corporal?
- 'Morning, Corporal!
- He doesn't talk to the likes of us.
Did you have bacon for breakfast?
- 'Morning, Ramsey.
- 'Morning. Filthy night, wasn't it?
- 'Morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Sire.
This one.
- What are you all staring at?
- Are you all right, Sire?
That was last night.
I've never felt better in my life.
Come, we eat.
I'm afraid this afternoon, you will need bigger napkins.
We attack at nine.
What is the ground like?
It will not dry before noon, Sire.
We've fought in mud before.
That's true.
- What's that?
- Sunday morning.
The priest in Plancenoit won't give up his mass.
Well, he won't have much of a congregation.
I'm not asleep, Drouot.
Sire, we need four hours. The ground is too soft to move my cannon.
Waiting four hours would have lost me Austerlitz.
Wellington won't hold us an hour with his English, Brunswickers and Belgians.
- I cannot answer for my cannon.
- You are the cannon, Drouot.
It would be better to attack at twelve.
Battles are lost and won in a quarter of an hour.
If Wellington were on the move,
I would say, go now.
But he is sitting with the mud in his favour.
In his favour?
Sir?
Uxbridge.
In case anything should happen to you, what are your plans?
To beat the French.
Dramatic fellows, these French.
Music and banners.
Quite beautiful.
You're a lucky fellow, Hay, to see such wonder in your first battle.
- Your Grace!
- What is it, Hay?
Over there, near the road!
His white horse! The monster.
So there's the great thief of Europe himself.
Napoleon has ridden within range.
May I have permission to try a shot?
Certainly not.
Commanders have something better to do than fire at each other.
Killing is a brotherly business, isn't it, de Lancey?
- Shall I shut them up, sir?
- No.
No, indulge it.
Anything that wastes time this morning, indulge it.
Normally, I don't like cheering.
But there's always a time to cut cards with the devil.
Would you kindly announce me?
- Who's the lad who leathers the French?
- Our Atty!
I've no need of a white horse to puff me, by God.
- Who gives salt to Marshal Soult?
- Our Atty!
- Who gave Johnny Francois a jolt?
- Our Atty!
- Who will peck Boney's bum?
- Our Atty!
- Who makes the "Parlez-vous" to run?
- Our Atty!
- Who's the boy with the hooky nose?
- Our Atty!
- Who's the lad who leathers the French?
- Our Atty!
- Who's the boy to kick Boney's arse?
- Our Atty!
Come on, get me out.
Drouot was right.
This mud may kill us.
The only enemy I fear is nature.
The battle orders, Sire.
There are more orders here than there were for the siege of Troy.
You can tell by the position of his guns that his might is on the right side.
He is afraid of his right.
All right.
Therefore that's where we'll tease him.
We'll have a diversionary action.
We tease his right side. If he weakens his centre to support the right -
Then I will know the calibre of this English aristocrat.
Gentlemen... today's fox.
- Clever chap, your tailor, Hay.
- Dunmore and Locke's in St. James.
Remind me of that de Lancey.
I like my men well dressed.
For the enemy.
- La Bedoyere?
- Yes, Sire.
Do you have children?
Yes. I have one son. Very young.
No taller than your boot.
And would you want him to be with you today?
Yes.
- Yes? Why?
- So he could see you, Sire.
See me...
I have a son.
I would give anything to see him.
I'd give my heart, my life.
But not here.
I wouldn't want him to witness this battle today.
His main strength is beyond that hill.
What he shows me is only a facade.
He is clever. Clever.
We'll begin the attack there.
At Hougoumont.
Well, that opens the ball.
Thirty-five minutes past eleven.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Return to your positions.
Fire!
Battalion, advance!
He's committed Foye's division.
He intends to turn us on the right.
What he seems to intend and what he does. -
Will be as different as white knight to black bishop.
We can move the 95th down, sir.
I will not run around like a wet hen.
There will be plenty of time, sir.
He hasn't moved.
He's nailed himself to his ridge.
This Englishman has two qualities that I admire.
Caution and, above all, courage.
He hasn't moved. Now we move the heavy artillery against Picton.
It seems he's swinging his weight to you, Picton.
- His guns move so smoothly.
- He moves his cannon like a pistol.
I doubt if Byland's brigade will stand.
Never mind.
Let him have a taste of it.
If they don't run first.
They're coming on in the same old style.
And we'll have to meet them in the same old style.
This one's going to take careful timing.
Gin up, boys.
Get it while you can.
The French will have it out of you in a minute, anyway.
- Dick?
- No, thank you.
Have a sup of gin with His Majesty's compliments.
Remind me to thank him next time we visit the palace.
- Would you say there are many of them?
- I can't see through a hill.
It's like the whole of bloody hell is coming up out of the ground.
Nothing frightens me more than being next to a friend of the Almighty.
The 72nd will prepare to advance!
Before we go, Uxbridge.
Savage stuff, Ponsonby.
You don't see its like anymore.
My father left us a hundredweight.
An old Jew in Alexandria had the blend.
Blend?
My father was killed by the French.
It never should have happened.
His horse got bogged in a field and the brute just gave up.
Seven lancers had him like a tiger in a pit.
- Bad luck, eh, Uxbridge?
- Damned bad luck.
Yes, particularly bad luck.
He had 400 better horses at home.
Byland's brigade has broken.
Plug the gap, if you please.
Now is the time for the heavy cavalry, I think.
Get your bastards up onto the crest.
I'll bring up the rest of the brigade.
Don't hurry yourself, Pic.
My lads'll hold them 'till you come.
Get forward, damn you.
The 92nd will advance!
Greenslade Mackenna!
Has Wellington nothing to offer me but these Amazons?
Fire!
On, you drunken rascals!
You whore's melts! You thieves!
Now, Scots Greys, now!
Those men on grey horses are terrifying.
They are the noblest cavalry in Europe. And the worst led.
That may be. That may be.
But we'll match them with our lancers.
We're the hard boys!
Charge for the guns!
Sound the recall!
Stop that useless noise.
You'll hurt yourself.
Get back! Sound the recall!
Lancers on your left!
Look out on the left!
Give these to my son.
Ride on. Save yourself.
By God, sir, the cannons are calling us.
March to the sound of the guns.
- Our duty is to...
- Do not teach me my duty, General.
My orders from the Emperor were precise.
To keep my sword in Blucher's back.
If you will not march to the sound of the guns, allow me to go.
And divide my force?
France would hang me.
And maybe France would be right.
- La Bedoyere!
- Yes, Sire.
What's moving there?
I see men marching in column.
Maybe five or six thousand.
He's right.
I see horses now.
Horses, but whose?
The French or the Prussians?
I think it's Grouchy's blue, sir.
It's what we feared, sir.
Grouchy has come across.
Damn it, it could be Prussian black.
Hay, your eyes are young.
Tell me the colour.
I think they're...
Prussians.
That's not necessary.
It's the Prussians.
But as far as we are concerned, they're on the moon.
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Sire.
Wellington wages war in a new way.
He fights sitting on his arse.
We'll have to move him off it.
Where's Grouchy?
La Haye Sainte. The one who wins the farmhouse wins the battle.
Where is Grouchy?
I need those men. Where is Grouchy?
Why must I do everything myself?
Sire, are you wounded?
As your doctor I advise you to come off the field. You must lie down.
I'm all right.
It's just my stomach.
After Austerlitz -
I said I would have six more good years.
Now it's ten years and nine campaigns later.
- Listening?
- Every word.
After I am dead and gone, what will the world say of me?
It will say you extended the limits of glory.
Is that all I'll leave my son?
The limits of glory?
He's concentrating his cavalry.
The infantry is still sitting.
Smoke without fire.
What's he at?
- A hard pounding, gentlemen.
- Yes, sir.
Lord Hay, take yourself for a run.
General Lambert will retire a hundred paces.
- But, Your Grace...
- Do as you're told, sir!
General order.
The army will retire a hundred paces.
The army retires 100 paces!
The 27th will take position behind the Gordons!
It's bad policy to stay near a tree in a thunderstorm. It attracts bolts.
I'll take your impudent advice.
Wellington's retreating!
Nillion, follow me!
Trumpeter, sound the advance!
- Le Fevre, are you with me?
- Yes, Sire!
Fire!
Withdraw to square!
Shoot at the horses!
What's Ney doing?
Can't I leave the field for a minute?
What's he doing there?
How can the cavalry go forward without infantry support?
Remember your wives, your sweethearts, your homes! Think of England, men!
Think of England!
Come on, you bastards!
Let me go! For God's sake, leave me alone!
- Let me go.
- Stop him, someone!
We've never seen each other.
How can we kill one another?
How can we? How can we?
How can we kill one another?
How can we? How can we?
Why do we? Why?
Ney requests infantry, Sire.
- General Lambert needs reinforcements.
- I can only give him my best wishes.
De Lancey, move that battery down towards Hougoumont.
Get the surgeon over here!
The farm house is ours!
Long live France!
Soult, write a letter to Paris right now and tell them...
- What time do you think it is?
- About six o'clock, Sire.
Tell them that at six o'clock we broke Wellington's forces -
And won the battle. No.
Tell them that we won the war.
The farm house has fallen, sir.
We can't hold them.
It appears, Uxbridge, that we're losing the battle.
Give me night.
Or give me Blucher.
Wellington's beaten.
He's bled to death.
Now move the Old Guard forward.
Then, on to Brussels.
Sire, if you go any further, you will be killed.
- A general should die on the field.
- Sire, you must go back. Please.
I abandon my position on the left.
I want all remaining men here!
Here. Every brigade, every battalion, here!
Put every gun to them, sir.
Every gun.
Very good, sir.
The lads are down to five rounds a man, Wellington.
But they'll stand.
If Blucher doesn't come through now, they'll break every bone in my body.
Good beans, Wellington.
If there's anything I know nothing about it is agriculture.
Sire, the Prussians are in the woods!
Blucher is in the woods!
I should have burned Berlin.
Raise the black flags, children.
No pity. No prisoners.
I'll shoot any man I see with pity in him.
Onward!
On, my children!
Now, Maitland! Now's your time!
To the guard!
- It's Grouchy!
- It's Blucher, look!
Run! All is lost! Run!
Why do you stand there like frightened children?
What are you afraid of?
You call yourselves soldiers!
Soult, remember you're a general.
La Bedoyere, the Prussians are too late.
Too late. Wellington is beaten.
Don't you understand? Wellington is beaten! Where's your faith?
I was in this position at Marengo.
I lost the battle at five o'clock, but I won it back again at seven!
Is it Prussians?
Up to them! Up to them!
Am I to fight alone?
Stand with me!
Are you French? Stand with me!
Are you the Guard?
One more hour and we have them beaten!
Don't you know me?
I'm Ney, Marshal of France!
Sir, the Prussians are here!
The Old Guard has broken!
Damn me, Uxbridge, if I ever saw
30,000 men run a race before.
- The whole line will advance.
- In which direction, Your Grace?
Straight ahead, to be sure.
Stand firm on the right!
Form square!
Form square!
By God, sir, I've lost my leg.
By God, sir, so you have.
Get forward with him!
Stand by the flag! Stand!
Sire, you must get out!
You must escape!
If I die, it will be here in the field, with my men.
Please, Sire.
The enemy must not touch you.
France must not lose you, Sire.
- Sire, the battle is lost.
- Where is Grouchy?
Where is Grouchy?
Vive la France!
You must stay alive, Sire.
Stand and form square!
We're doing murder, Your Grace.
I hope to God -
I've fought my last battle.
Brave Frenchmen!
You have done all that the honour of war requires.
His Grace, the Duke of Wellington, invites you to save your lives.
Will you agree to surrender?
Merde!
Fire!
Why do we? Why? Why?
Next to a battle lost, the saddest thing is a battle won.
You must leave this place of dead flesh.
They will chain you -
Like Prometheus to a rock.
Where the memory of your own greatness will gnaw you.
- You got all your stuff?
- Oh, yeah.
When you get there be sure to give us a call.
- We want to know where you are.
- Alright.
- How are you fixed for money?
- l'm OK.
Well, you...
You better take this...
Take this fifty in case you run into a mite of trouble.
You never know what's gonna happen between here and there.
- Thank you.
- You got it.
Well, boy...
Don't worry too much. lt's just the smart people that have to worry.
The Lord will take care of the ignorant ones.
- You paying attention?
- Right.
There ya go.
See ya.

He wants to just look at her and maybe have this picture in his head when he's fighting in the jungles. ls that so much to ask? l mean...
Hey! This is for you, man.
Wait a minute. This is what you want.

The court is about to pronounce sentence upon each of you. lt is the sentence of the court that you be confined to the workhouse for 30 days or pay a fine of $50.
Your Honour, l... l don't think you understand.
We haven't got any bread, see... l'm awfully sorry.
There isn't anything l can do for you.
- Your Honour?
- Yes, sir.
What if one of us has the money?

You may proceed to pay your fine.
Proceed to the clerk's office.
Excuse me, Your Honour, one second.

One second. Claude, listen, man.
Let me get out. l'll get the money, come back, get everybody out.
This is my money. l'm sorry. My dad gave me this in case of trouble. This is trouble.
Don't be stupid. This is your last chance to get us outta here.
Stop it. This is mine. l'm gettin' outta here.
- What's the matter, don't you trust me?
- Of course not.
Look, man, don't be stupid.
How you gonna get the bread?
You don't know anybody on the streets.
How are you gonna get the bread?
He's not, man. He's just gonna leave us in here to rot. That's all.
No, l can make some calls.

So would you just, stop the car, OK?
Just let me drive.
Sheila!
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Tell him to stop.
Stop.
My friends are still in jail. You could ask your old man for the bread to get 'em out.
Ask my father for the money? Oh, right!
He got us into this.
The least he could do is get us out of it.
- He got you into this?
- Yeah.
He told you to dance on the table?
- No, he didn't tell me that.

Right after school. How's that?
About four o'clock, OK?
We'll have it for you at four o'clock.
See, that's just what my other problem is, man.

You won't ask your old man for the bread and Junior's full of shit.
What am l doing here?
No.
- And men?
- Men? Whaddaya mean?
Do you have any sexual attraction towards men?
- You mean if l'm homosexual or somethin'?
- Yeah.
Well, l wouldn't kick Mick Jagger out of my bed but l'm not a homosexual, no.
Well, tell me. Tell me why you're so uptight about having your hair cut.
She asked me why l'm just a hairy guy l'm hairy noon and night
Hair that's a fright l'm hairy high and low
Don't ask me why
Don't know lt's not for lack of bread
Like the Grateful Dead
Darlin'
Give me a head with hair, long beautiful hair
Shinin', gleamin', steamin'
Flaxen, waxen
Gimme it down to there, hair
Shoulder-length or longer
Here, baby, there, mama
Everywhere, daddy
Hair
Grow it
Show it, long as God can grow it, my hair
Let it fly in the breeze and get caught in the trees
Give a home to the fleas in my hair
A home for fleas
A hive for the buzzin' bees
A nest for birds, there ain't no words
For the beauty, the splendour, the wonder of my hair
Flow it, show it
Long as God can grow it
My hair l want it long, straight, curly, fuzzy
Snaggy, shaggy, ratty, matty, oily, greasy, fleecy, shinin', gleamin', steamin'
Flaxen, waxen, knotted, polka-dotted
Twisted, beaded, braided
Powdered, perfumed and confettied, bangled, tangled, spangled
And spaghettied
Say, can you see my eyes? lf you can
Then my hair's too short
Down to here, down to there
Down to there, down to where it stops by itself
They'll be gaga at the go-go when they see me in my toga ln my toga made of blond brilliantined biblical hair
My hair like Jesus wore it
Hallelujah, l adore it
Hallelujah, Mary loved her son
Why don't my mother love me?
Hair
Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it
My hair
Flow it, show it
Long as God can grow it
My hair

- Don't hand me that. lf you're doing it for me, don't. lf the shoe was on the other foot, l wouldn't do it for you.
Give me my clothes.
Listen, how's she gonna get home? She doesn't have her stuff, she has no bread.
You better get that stuff to her.
Me?
Yeah. That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
And you're telling me l'm ridiculous?

Black boys are delicious
Chocolate-flavoured love
Liquorice lips like candy
Keep my cocoa handy l have such a sweet tooth
When it comes to love
Once l tried a diet
Of quiet rest, no sweets
But l went nearly crazy
And l went clearly crazy
Because l really crave for

Skin as smooth as milk
White boys are so pretty
Hair like Chinese silk
White boys give me goose bumps
White boys give me chills
When they touch my shoulder
That's the touch that kills
My mother calls them lilies l call 'em piccadillies
My daddy warns me to stay away
But l say come and play
White boys are so groovy
White boys are so tough
Every time they're near me l just can't get enough
White boys are so sexy
Sexy
They're so long and lean
Love those sprayed-on trousers l love the love machine
My brother calls them rubble
They're my kind of trouble
My daddy warns me no
But l say, white boys, go!
White boys are so lovely
Beautiful as girls
Love to run my fingers
And toes through all their curls
Give me a tall
A lean

Pretending it's our chore
They ship us off to war ln this dive we rediscover sensation
Walking in space
We find the purpose of peace
The beauty of life
You can no longer hide
Our eyes are open

- Hi, Steve.
- Hi.
Wanna come out of the car for a minute?
No. l just wanna talk to ya.
You wanna talk? Talk. l'd like to talk to you outside. l don't wanna talk to you.
Don't worry about a thing. l'll handle this.
OK. Whaddaya want?
- Keys.
- No.
- Hey, come on.
- Come on, Steve, cool out, baby.
- Come on. You're taking the car?
- Just for a few days. Coming with us?
No, l'm not going with you. Come on, Sheila.
Sheila. Out of the car. Sheila.
What? Sheila! l'm not into any heavy preference trip, y'know, like who the father is. l don't care. l think they're both beautiful. Don't you?
But how can you not care about something like that? lf a woman carries a child, she should know who the father is, don't you think?
Well, l... l admit that l have this dilemma.
But it'll be resolved real soon. lt's not a big crisis or anything. lt's not a world war. l don't know what you're so uptight about. l fell in love with someone.
We had a child.
We were going to get married.
That's why l'm uptight.
- Yeah?
- And you're holding it up.
No, l'm not holding it up.
See, you don't see the way it is.
This is really, like, a great thing that's happened.
To all of us. Everybody's happy about it.
The guys are really happy. l think it'd be great if you could, y'know, be happy about it, too.
- You're crazy.
- Yeah. We're all crazy. Let's shake on it.
Let's not.
Come on!
Attention!
Stand at ease! lf all you men could be standing where l'm standing, and seeing what l'm seeing, you'd know how it feels to be truly proud of our country.
The United States Army is the greatest fighting force in the world.
And now you men are going to be thousands of miles away from home in a few days, and you'd better take some of that greatness with you.
And this afternoon, while you're on leave, you'd better take some with you, too.

- Hi.
- What can l do for you?
We're going in.
Sorry, no civilian contact allowed right now. There's been an alert.
We're not civilians.
We're friends of a guy on the base.
Claude Bukowski. You may know him.
Private, blond hair. l don't know any Bukowski. l'm sorry, you still have to turn around and go off post.
Alright? You need help, l'll be glad to assist you.
Otherwise, back up and turn around.
- We don't wanna make trouble...
- Turn around and you won't.
- OK, just let me make a phone call...
- You make your call where l tell you to go.
You said you'd give me assistance. l'd like...
- l'll help you turn round. That's the help.
- You don't understand...
Chief, this is it, right here.
Turn the vehicle round and go.
Are we clear?
You get my drift?
Turn your vehicle round. Off post.
- You don't understand...
- No, you don't.

- Listen, man... l just wanna see my friend... l'm telling you, get the hell off my post.
You turn around and go that way.
You listen to me. Got that?
Thank you. Have a nice day.
What's your name?
George.
What's yours?
Sheila.
Yeah? Where's your husband? On the base? l'm not married. l'm visiting my brother.
No, wait. OK. This time, l'm gonna do it.
Hey, that was a really good one.
Wait, let me do that again.
OK, l'll blow one, then you blow one, and see if they can, y'know...
Like, you blow one through one of mine.
OK?
Nearly did it...
Where is it? Where's your car?
Over there.
Hi.
God Almighty.
Hey, let's pull over there.
Stop. Let's stop here. Company, halt.

Everybody's waiting. We got a big picnic planned for you in the desert. Get in.
Berger, the base is on alert.
They're taking head counts all the time. lf l'm not here, l've had it.
Listen, man, it's just for a couple of hours. l'll have you back in time for dinner.
- l can't.
- What do you mean you can't?
We just drove 2,000 miles to see you.
Everybody's waiting.
Look, just trust me. l got it all figured out.
You're making it sound like l don't wanna come.
Then, come. Get in the trunk, man. l mean... l can't believe you're here. l just can't believe it.
Travelling all that way. l can't believe it. l appreciate your coming here. l can't tell you...
Don't tell me. Just come with us.
Just get in the trunk.
You don't understand. This isn't a game.
What am l gonna tell everybody?
Did Sheila come?

Everybody's there, man.
How is Sheila?
How is she?

We've been alerted for overseas movement.
At this time l want you to get your bags packed, and get out on this red line.
Sergeant, you've got three minutes to have these men ready.
Let's go, men.
Move with purpose. There's a war on.
On the double! Move!
Let's go! Let's get it on!
Let's move with a purpose!
Snap to it like you've got a pair.
Let's go! Move it! Quickly!
Let's go! Get on the red line.
Get yourself a backpack.
Let's go! Move like you got a purpose.
What the hell's wrong with you, soldier?
Didn't you hear what the Captain said?
Get your bag packed! Get your helmet!
Get your pistol belt! Get it right now!
Let's move like you got a purpose.
Get the doggone coat on!
Quickly! What's the matter with you troops?
You act like you don't wanna go! l don't wanna go, but if you gotta go, l gotta go, we all gotta go.
Let's move it! Now! Right now!
Let's get on the red line. Let's go!
Let's go! Move with a purpose!
What in the hell are you waiting on?
Get that web gear on! l want that rain bucket on your head! l want that duffel bag on the red line.
Soldier, there's a war on!
Move, hurry up!
Now listen up. When l call your name l want you to sound off smartly, and move out.
- Calpo!
- Yes, sir!
- Sumner!
- Yes, sir!
- Harrison!
- Yes, sir!
- Brock!
- Yes, sir!
Bukowski!
Bukowski!
Bukowski!
You'd better get your head outta your ass!
Let's go! This way, soldier!
Let's go. Move out! You better move, soldier!
Hey, where are you going?
What's the matter with you? l said put the duffel bag on that truck!
The vehicle right there!
Let's go! Get it on there!
Now!
We starve
Look at one another short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats

Greatness
Who knows what stands in front of
Our lives? l fashion my future
On films in space
Silence tells me secretly
Everything

Across the Atlantic Sea
And l'm a genius l believe in God
And l believe that God believes in Claude
That's me

A home for fleas
A hive for the buzzin' bees
A nest for birds, there ain't no words for the beauty, the splendour
The wonder of my hair
Flow it, show it, long as God can grow it, my hair l want it long, straight, curly, fuzzy, snaggy, shaggy, ratty, matty
Oily, greasy, fleecy, shinin', gleamin', steamin', flaxen, waxen
Knotted, polka-dotted
Twisted, beaded, braided
Powdered, perfumed and confettied bangled, tangled, spangled
And spaghettied

Down to here, down to there, down to there, down to where it stops by itself
They'll be gaga at the go-go when they see me in my toga

l am, beyond a doubt,
the last of the old-timers,
My name is Jack Crabb, and I am the soIe white survivor of the BattIe of LittIe Bighorn, popuIarIy known as Custer's Last Stand.
WeII, Mr Crabb,
I'm more interested in the primitive
IifestyIe of the PIains Indian than I am in...
(LAUGHS ) ...taII taIes about Custer.
TaII taIes?
Are you caIIing me a Iiar?
No, no. It's just that...
I'm interested in the way of Iife of the Indian, rather than, shaII we say, adventure.
You think the BattIe of LittIe Bighorn was an adventure?
LittIe Bighorn was not representative of encounters between whites and Indians, Mr Crabb.
You see, the near genocide of the Indian...
- The near what?
- Near genocide.
It means...
...extermination.
The kiIIing off of an entire peopIe.
That's practicaIIy what we did to the Indian.
But, of course, I wouIdn't expect an oId Indian fighter, Iike you, to agree with me.
- Turn that thing on.
- Pardon?
I said, turn that thing on and shut up.
You sit there and you'II Iearn something.
I knowed GeneraI
George Armstrong Custer for what he was, and I aIso knowed the Indians for what they was.
1 1 1 years ago, when I was ten years oId, my famiIy, in crossing the Great PIains,
was wiped out
by a band of wild lndians,
Everybody was killed or drug off
by them murdering varmints
except me and my sister Caroline,
(MUSlC: DOLEFUL HARMONlCA)
Ah! Oh!
Bye, Jack. I'II see you in heaven.
Goodbye, CaroIine.
We didn't know the difference then,
but it was a band of Pawnee
what attacked us,
l ain't had no use
for Pawnee ever since,
But this one wasn't a Pawnee,
He was a Cheyenne brave,
l later got to know him well,
His name was
Shadow That Comes ln Sight,
At first sight of an lndian camp,
what you think is:
''l see their dump, Where's the camp?''
He brought us to their chief,
His name was Old Lodge Skins,
who later become my granddaddy,
What do they want, CaroIine?
It's as pIain as day what they want, Jack.
What?
Me.
To show good manners,
Old Lodge Skins smoked
with our oldest male survivor,
They didn't know I was a woman.
That expIains why they didn't rape me right off.
I don't think they're going to bother you.
No such Iuck, Jack.
They'II get me tonight, for sure.
Poor Caroline never did have
no luck with men,
l reckon she figured
we both couldn't get away
and she'd send help to rescue me,
The next morning, l found myself
in that lndian camp all alone,
But the Cheyenne, who call
themselves the Human Beings,
had no idea to hurt me,
l was an honoured guest
and they gave me a treat, Boiled dog,
Dog ain't bad, neither,
Greasy, l'll admit,
but you'd be surprised
how delicate the flavour is,
especially when you're starving,
You see, the Human Beings
adopted me as one of their own,
Shadow That Comes ln Sight
taught me the bow and arrow
and how to stalk game,
Burns Red ln The Sun showed me how
to protect my pale skin from sunburn,
lt's little known that some lndians,
like Burns Red,
will sunburn their own selves,
But my real teacher was my adopted
grandpa, Old Lodge Skins,
He taught me to read a trail, Cheyenne
language and lots of other things,
For a boy, it was a kind of paradise,
l wasn't just playing lndian,
l was living lndian,
Only one thing bothered me:
l was small for my years,
ln fact, darn near a runt,
The Pawnee stoIe seven ponies.
There's going to be a war party.
But you can't go. You're too IittIe and weak, Iike a girI.
Run away now or I'II kick you.
The lndians had never heard
of fist fighting, and it amazed them,
How did you do that?
I'm sorry, Younger Bear.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
The lndian way: never feel sorry
about beating an enemy
unless, having conquered his body,
you want his spirit as well,
l had made the first real enemy
of my life,
There once was a Human Being, and he was very smaII.
But he won a name: LittIe Man.
You've heard of him?
No, Grandfather.
He went on a war party against the Pawnees.
But the Pawnees were many.
One by one, the Human Beings were rubbed out.
LittIe Man was very brave.
The Pawnees caIIed out to him,
''If you wiII quit fighting, we wiII Iet you go.''
But LittIe Man answered,
''It's a good day to die.''
FinaIIy, they cut off his head, but he kept fighting without his head.
He rode among the Pawnees
Iike a whirIwind, and his head, which was stuck on a spear, started to shout the war cry.
The Pawnees couId take no more, and they ran away.
When they Iooked back, they saw the body of LittIe Man
Iie down among his friends.
LittIe Man was smaII, but his bravery was big.
The Human Beings don't require
a boy to be a warrior
if he ain't got the temperament,
and Little Horse didn't,
lf he wanted to stay
with the women,
that was all right
with the Human Beings,
We wiII Ieave the ponies here.
You hoId them.
No! I don't want to.
I want to go to the Pawnee camp.
You... You aren't even a Human Being.
You're white.
He didn't believe it himself,
Younger Bear was just trying
to hand me the worst possible insult,
Ah! Ah!
LittIe White Man...
...fooI poor Pawnee.
Big fooIing. You want to eat?
Pawnees was always
sucking up to whites,
LittIe White Man not mad, huh?
See? Pawnee friend.
Fix this bad Indian for LittIe White Man.
Uh!
l always felt kind of bad
about that poor Pawnee,
l didn't mean to kill him,
l just meant to distract him,
l had made a real enemy
of Younger Bear,
I give you these ponies, but...I owe you a Iife.
Saving his life was the final insult,
This boy is no Ionger a boy.
He is a brave. He is IittIe in body, but his heart is big.
His name shaII be LittIe Big Man.
I don't understand it. Why wouId they kiII women and chiIdren?
Because they are strange.
They do not seem to know where the centre of the earth is.
We must have a war on these cowards and teach them a Iesson.
(BEATING ON DRUMS
AND CHANTING )
This wiII be the first time, my son,
I face the whites as an enemy.
I don't know whether you remember before you became a Human Being and as dear a son to me as those I made with
BuffaIo WaIIow Woman and the others, but I won't speak of that unfortunate time.
I just want to say, if you beIieve riding against these white creatures is bad, you can stay out of the fight.
No one wiII think the worse.
Grandfather, I think it's a good day to die.
My heart soars Iike a hawk.
l'm sorry to say that Old Lodge Skins'
war against the whites
was kind of pitiful,
Not that the Human Being
wasn't brave,
No warrior ever walked the earth
more brave than a Human Being,
But Old Lodge Skins' idea of war
was different from the whites',
Half our party didn't use weapons,
They ''took coup'',
hit the enemy with a little stick,
Humiliate them,
That was how a Human Being
taught a coward a lesson
and won a war,
Shadow!
Repeating rifles
against bow and arrow,
l never understood how the whites
could be so proud of winning
with them kind of odds,
Yee...argh... !
God bIess George Washington!
Before l knowed it,
them words popped out,
God bIess my mother!
You murdering fooI!
Do I have to cut your throat before you see I'm white?
- White?
- Sure I'm white.
Didn't I say, ''God bIess Washington and my mother''?
What kind of Indian wouId say a fooI thing Iike that?
Lend me that to get off this paint.
The troopers took me
and turned me over
to the Reverend Silas Pendrake,
for moral guidance
and a Christian upbringing,
- Can you drive a buggy, boy?
- Oh, yes, sir. I can do it.
You're a Iiar, boy.
If you was reared by the Indians, how couId you Iearn to drive a buggy?
We shaII have to beat the Iying out of you.
(MUSlC: DOLEFUL HARMONlCA)
Dear Jack.
WeIcome to your new home.
Your travaiI is over, enfoIded now as you are in Christian Iove.
WeII, boy, are you unabIe to converse?
- No, I'm gIad to meet your daughter.
- You are addressing my wife.
Poor boy. Poor darIing.
Think of the years of suffering, deprivation and hardship among those awfuI savages.
The boy's deprivation, my dear, has been more spirituaI than physicaI.
The Indians know nothing of God and moraI right.
They eat human fIesh, fornicate, aduIterise, misogynise and commune constantIy with minions of the deviI.
It must be our task... nay, our Christian duty,
- to beat the misery out.
- Beat the poor boy?
- Not whiIe there's breath in my body.
- l could have kissed her,
I didn't mean beat him IiteraIIy.
I meant beat him symboIicaIIy.
Poor boy. He hasn't even had a proper bath.
- I detect the odour of food.
- I shaII wash this poor boy.
It's supper time.
It is my Christian duty to give this boy an immediate, thorough bath.
- Take your cIothes off.
- Off?
- Yes.
- AII of them?
Every stitch. But I shaII avert my eyes at the necessary moment.
# Bringing in the sheaves
# Bringing in the sheaves
# We shaII come rejoicing
# Bringing in the sheaves #
Greatest bath l ever had in my life,
# ShaII we gather at the river?
# The beautifuI, the beautifuI river #
You do reaIise, don't you, dear Jack, that the Reverend Pendrake is not aItogether wrong?
What? I mean, what, ma'am?
WeII, Jesus is your saviour.
- You do reaIise that, don't you?
- Oh, Lordy. Yes, Mrs Pendrake.
Are you thinking of Jesus, Jack?
Yes'm. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
- You mustn't fib to me.
- Oh, no.
I Iove Jesus and Moses and aII of them.
There's quite a difference.
Moses was a Hebrew, but Jesus was a GentiIe,
Iike you and me.
Ain't you done washing that boy yet?
I'm giving the chiId reIigious instruction.
I want to eat.
Looks Iike a weII-growed chiId, if you ask me.
AII right now, dear. PIease stand up and Iet me dry you off.
I shaII avert my eyes, of course.
Now step out of the tub.
ActuaIIy, you are rather weII-grown, Jack.
You're smaII, but...nice-Iooking.
Did you know that?
- No, ma'am.
- WeII, you are.
AII the more reason for you to receive reIigious instruction.
The girIs, I'm sure, wiII aII be after you.
- And, Jack...
- Ma'am?
That way Iies madness.
What way, ma'am?
You'II understand these things better when you're oIder.
The point is, my dear boy, that we aII must resist temptation.
Purity is its own reward.
Dear Jack...
WeIcome to your new home.
(BREATHLESS ) Now dress...
...and come in to supper.
l went to school and learned all over
how to read and write and cipher,
lt was strange at first,
but Mrs Pendrake tutored me
and l learned fast,
But there was one thing
l didn't know about
and that was a thing called sin,
I caught you at the gates of heII!
Boy, the hand of God must smite the carcass of man.
It's worth it, dear Jack.
It's worth it a miIIion times over to be pure and good, to waIk in the paths of righteousness.
There's no happiness Iike it.
Do you beIieve me, Jack?
Do you beIieve me?
Yes, ma'am. I sure do.
# Amazing grace... #
So it was
l entered my religion period,
l was a great little hymn singer,
and l wasn't fooling,
l'd been saved,
I baptise you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the HoIy Spirit.
O Lord, Iook down upon this poor boy who Iived among the heathen and cIeanse him of the corruption of their fouI, pagan ways and make him white again as the snow.
Let him be reborn and repurified in thy name.
I baptise you in the name of the
Father, the Son and the HoIy Spirit.
Amen.
Mrs Pendrake was right
about temptation,
l'd have nothing to do
with them Jezebels,
l told her about my triumph
over temptation,
and we read the Bible
for about an hour to celebrate,
As the weeks went by, l fell more
and more in love with Mrs Pendrake,,,
,,,spiritually, of course,
I shaII be off for my shopping.
The boy's doing so poor these days, why not take him aIong and air him?
- He'd be bored with the shopping.
- No, I wouIdn't, ma'am.
AII right, then.
You come with me, Jack.
Good morning, Mr Kane.
This is Jack, my adopted son.
What's your pIeasure, ma'am?
WeII, Iet's see.
I think I shaII have a sassafras fIip.
How about you, buster?
Oh. Yeah, I'II have the same.
Never mind for me.
I must do my shopping.
It wouId bore you terribIy, Jack.
You stay here and have some cake.
- I'II take care of him, Mrs Pendrake.
- Thank you very much, Mr Kane.
That soda shop was something,
Especially that elephant-head spigot,
l was playing with it
and enjoying myself,
Then, all of a sudden,
an awful feeling run through me,
Where had that fellow gone to?
(MRS PENDRAKE) Don't.
Don't. No, don't.
Oh, yeah. No, don't...
Yeah, pIease. No, don't.
(GIGGLING ) Pagan beast.
HeIp!
You deviI. You fiIthy, dirty deviI.
Heathen.
No, no...yeah, yeah, yeah.
No. HeIp! HeIp! HeIp. I'm dying.
(JACK) She was calling him a devil
and moaning for help,
but l didn't get no idea
she wanted to be rescued,
That was the end
of my religion period,
l ain't sung a hymn in 1 04 years,
After starving a while,
l took up with a swindler,
name of Allardyce T Meriweather,
After Mrs Pendrake, his honesty
was downright refreshing,
(MERIWEATHER) It is my mission to pass on to you...
Meriweather was one
of the smartest men l ever knowed,
but he tended to lose
parts of himself,
When l joined him, his left hand
and his left ear were already gone,
We might see a miracIe, one I have witnessed before.
The power of this eIixir has been proven...
(CRIES OUT) WaIk!
WaIk!
During my years with Meriweather,
he lost an eye
as a result of a fifth ace
dropping out his sleeve
in a poker game,
lt didn't faze him, though,
Deception was his life's blood,
even if it caused him to get
whittled down kind of gradual like,
You're improving. You just can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty.
The one that ruined you was that Indian, OId Tepee.
- You mean OId Lodge Skins?
- He gave you a vision of moraI order in the universe, and there isn't any.
Those stars twinkIe in a void, dear boy, and the two-Iegged creature schemes and dreams beneath them, aII in vain.
AII in vain, Jack.
- You hear anything?
- Listen to me!
Men wiII beIieve anything, the more preposterous the better.
WhaIes speak French at the bottom of the sea.
The horses of Arabia have siIver wings.
Pygmies mate with eIephants in darkest Africa.
I have soId aII those propositions.
WeII, maybe we're aII fooIs and none of it matters.
Ah...
You stay with AIIardyce Meriweather, and you'II wear siIk.
I don't know as I want to wear siIk.
My dear boy, what eIse can a man of parts wear than siIk?
Tar and feathers, I reckon.
AII right. Sit right there.
Don't make no moves unIess you want a IittIe dayIight in your Iiver.
What, may I ask, brings you out into the wiIds at this hour, sir?
- That them?
- Yes.
I've seen this young one before.
- I've never been in this country.
- You Iook famiIiar, bub.
Oh! Sir...
What's in there? Lye?
You can't expect me to reveaI its constituents.
Sir, pIease.
You're wasting precious medicine.
Seven foIks are haIf-dead because of this. What's in it?
Nothing harmfuI, I assure you.
- What?
- MostIy water.
Whiskey, a IittIe pepper, oiI of cIoves, ginger root...
- What's that?
- What's what?
Oh, that. It's a dozen snake heads, to give it strength.
AII right, boys.
Yee-ha... !
Got caught, Jack, that's aII.
Life contains a particIe of risk.
- You don't know when you're Iicked.
- Licked?
I'm not Iicked.
I'm tarred and feathered, that's aII.
AII right, boys.
I reckon they've been rode enough.
- Why, Hickok himseIf can't hit three.
- Throw up three.
What's your name, son?
- Jack Crabb.
- Lord above!
I've tarred and feathered my own brother!
It's wonderfuI, Jack.
I can give you something you never had before, and something I never had before, neither...
...a reaI...famiIy Iife.
Yeah.
You are back in the bosom of your famiIy, Jack.
OK, now you.
I don't know anything about guns.
I never even carried none.
Lord! What kind of upbringing did them Indians give you?
Never carried no gun? Why, a man ain't compIete without a gun.
- Go snake-eyed.
- Do what?
Like this.
Like this.
AII right.
Now...
Draw and shoot that bottIe before you touch the gun.
How can I draw and shoot the gun before I touch it?
Concentrate. Try it.
Hot damn! Yeah.
Caroline was right,
lt is possible to shoot a gun
before you touch it,
'Course, it takes lightning reflexes,,,
and considerable
snake-eyed concentration,
Throw up three.
- Why, Hickok himseIf can't hit three.
- Throw up three.
NaturaI-born gunfighter.
So it was l entered
my gunfighter period,
You're crowding me.
I didn't see you. I'm sorry.
It's stupid of me to take up aII that room.
- Set me up with a soda pop.
- Yes, sir. Right away, kid.
The Soda Pop Kid,
that's what they called me,
Soda pop, he wants.
- Anything wrong with that, stranger?
- No, not a thing, friend.
In fact, I admire the styIe of you.
Might I ask who I are addressing?
I'm WiId BiII Hickok.
WeII, I'm...
- I'm pIeased to meet you.
- The pIeasure's mutuaI, friend.
Bring your soda pop over here and sit for a whiIe.
I can break three bottIes throwed in the air.
That's shooting.
How many men have you...
...gunned down?
I don't rightIy recoIIect.
How many have you?
Oh, about...
...two dozen.
- That a fact?
- No, it wasn't a fact at all,
During my gunfighter period,
l was an awful liar,
I wouIdn't have estimated your totaI that high.
No offence intended, but you don't have the Iook of murder in your eye.
Like that buzzard over there.
Him? WeII, he's just a common drunk.
Hm...
What are you so nervous about?
Getting shot.
I got a fuII house!
I got a...fuII house.
Now you've got me doing it.
Sorry.
HoId the fort a whiIe, oId horse, whiIe I get another bottIe.
Did you know the man, BiII?
Never saw the gent before.
Mr Hickok, that man is reaIIy dead.
Got him through the Iungs and heart, both.
SeIIing your gunfighter outfit?
Turning in your gun?
- WeII, sorry, CaroIine.
- There ain't nothing more useIess than a gunfighter who can't shoot peopIe.
Men!
Ah-har!
There went the bosom of my family,
Having tried religion, snake-oil
and gunfighting unsuccessfully,
l took a partner,
become a respectable storekeeper,
and married Olga, a Swedish girl
who couldn't hardly speak no English,
Preserve the moment.
Yes.
OIga, shaII I carry you over the threshoId?
Ja?
- It's a custom.
- Ja?
WeII, it ain't much now, OIga, but me and my partner, we got big pIans.
Free enterprise and honest sweat.
Ja, Ja,
I don't understand this biII.
Looks Iike I'm being charged twice.
Ja, the biIIs of the store.
There must be an error. Jack
AppIebound wouIdn't do that to me.
Jack, enough the biIIs.
Come and get some rest.
I must be making a mistake.
Jack, the rest, the body.
You needs it.
Yeah.
Maybe I do.
Rest.
OIga. OIga, come on.
We'II get out of this somehow.
One little thing about my new
business partner: he was a thief,
(AUC TlONEER) ,,,25 cents for
this glorious musical instrument,
Look at this beautiful instrument,
Who will take it?
- That is a pathetic scene.
- Yes, sir.
A ruined and desoIate famiIy wiped out by economic misfortune.
I find it touching.
l'll never forget the first time
l set eyes
on General George Armstrong Custer,
(OLGA) Ruined! That's what we used to have. Ruined!
Do you have another trade?
WeII, GeneraI, I... Not exactIy.
Then take my advice. Go west.
West?!
- My wife is scared of Indians.
- You have nothing to fear.
I give you my personaI guarantee.
OIga! OIga!
- Hit him! Hit him!
- Sorry, brother.
I think we're going to get away.
- Let me at him! I've got a gun here.
- We must be civiIised.
''And it came to pass after the pIague that the Lord spake...''
Grab the reins! Grab the reins!
- Give it! Give me that shotgun.
- No, it's mine!
- (UNINTELLIGIBLE RANTING )
- Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!
Yee-haa!
Ah! Get back!
Come on, get back!
Jack!
Get back.
I'II protect you.
Aaah... !
OIga!
OIga!
OIga.
l covered most of three states
and hundreds of square miles
looking for Olga, with no luck at all,
- Hey, Crabb.
- Whiskey, whiskey...
For a drink of whiskey, they'II give you a squaw.
Sure save you a Iot of Iooking.
l looked everywhere for my wife
but couldn't find her,
Finally, l had to go deeper
into Cheyenne country,
l didn't figure for me
it was dangerous,
speaking Cheyenne and having
once been a Human Being myself,
- KiII him.
- I didn't steaI, brother.
Why do you caII me ''brother''?
Don't. I am not your brother.
I am a Human Being.
I suppose you wiII say you have never heard of LittIe Big Man.
LittIe Big Man was my brother, but you're not him.
He was kiIIed after rubbing out many bIuecoats.
Did you see the body?
No, he turned into a swaIIow and fIew away.
- Let's kiII him.
- Shadow! You were shot.
I put you on a pony.
I saved you.
Dirt On The Nose, do you stiII have the pony I gave you?
No. The Pawnee stoIe him when we camped at the OId Woman Butte five snows ago.
It is true there is a thing here
I do not understand.
There is a pain between my ears.
My son, to see you again causes my heart to soar Iike a hawk.
Sit here beside me.
Grandfather,
I brought you this present.
Is this the hat I used to own, except grown softer of skin and fatter?
No, grandfather, it's another.
We must smoke to your return.
I saw you in a dream.
You were drinking from a spring that came from the Iong nose of an animaI.
I did not recognise the animaI.
AIongside his nose, he grew two horns, and the water that gushed from his nose was fuII of air.
l can't explain it,
but he was talking
about that elephant-head spigot
in the soda shop,
This wasn't the only time Old Lodge
Skins had dreams that turned out true,
Don't be angry, my son, with
Burns Red, Shadow and the others.
They had many a bad experience with the white man Iast year.
I have thought and taIked and smoked on this matter, and my decision is...
LittIe Big Man has returned.
lt was quite a homecoming,
LittIe Big Man.
lt was Little Horse, the boy
who didn't want to fight the Pawnee,
Don't you remember me?
This hurts me in my heart.
I think I'II cry.
He'd become a heemaneh,
for which there ain't no English word,
And he was a good one, too,
The Human Beings
thought a lot of him,
- HeIIo, Younger Bear.
- Goodbye.
lt was the boy whose life l'd saved,
to his mortal embarrassment,
Did you catch the rabbits on your hunting trip?
No.
Then don't give them to BuffaIo WaIIow Woman.
You see, Younger Bear
had become a contrary,
the most dangerous
of all Cheyenne warriors
because the way they live
drives them half-crazy,
Except for battle, a contrary
does everything backwards,
He says ''goodbye'' for ''hello'',
''yes'' for ''no'',
walks through bushes
instead of on trails,
and washes with dirt
and dries with water,
I thought you were dead.
Why have you come back when nobody wants to see you?
You mustn't speak to LittIe Big Man
Iike that. You owe him a Iife.
I'm gIad I said it. HeIIo.
That was supposed to mean
he was sorry he said it, goodbye,
But that warrior wasn't sorry,
He hated me still,
Grandfather, I have a white wife.
You do?
That's interesting.
Does she cook and work hard?
Oh, yes, Grandfather.
That surprises me.
Does she show pIeasant enthusiasm when you mount her?
WeII, sure, Grandfather.
That surprises me even more.
I tried one of them once, but she didn't show any enthusiasm at aII.
WeII, Grandfather, aII the whites aren't crazy.
I'm gIad to hear that, my son.
- I thought they were.
- Oh, no.
I know of one who is as brave as any Human Being.
I'd Iike to meet this man and smoke with him.
What is he caIIed?
He's caIIed GeneraI Custer.
GeneraI Custer.
- What does the name mean, my son?
- WeII, it means...
- ...''Iong hair''.
- Good name. How did he win it?
He won it in the war of the whites to free the bIack men.
Oh, yes.
The bIack white men.
I know of them.
It is said a bIack white man once became a Human Being.
But mostIy, they are strange creatures.
Not as ugIy as the white, true, but they're just as crazy.
Don't worry, my son.
You'II return to the Human Beings.
I dreamed it Iast night.
I saw you and your wives as you crawIed from one to the other in your tepee.
- Wives, Grandfather?
- Oh, yes. Three or four.
It was dark, and they were hidden under buffaIo robes.
But it was a great copuIation, my son.
The Human Beings onIy take one wife.
How couId I have three or four?
I don't know. It worries me.
l was sure l'd never see him again,
Sir! I expect being a scout is the best way to find my wife, GeneraI.
She was captured when we went west, Iike you advised.
I advised? ImpossibIe.
I've never set eyes on you.
You wouIdn't remember me, sir.
Furthermore, you don't Iook
Iike a scout to me. Not a bit.
A scout has a certain appearance.
Kit Carson, for exampIe.
But you don't have it.
You Iook Iike...
- ...a muIe skinner.
- I know nothing about muIes.
I can teII the occupation of a man by Iooking at him.
Notice the bandy Iegs, the strong arms.
This man has spent years with muIes.
- Isn't that correct?
- WeII, I...
Yes, sir.
- Hire the muIe skinner!
- Yes, sir.
Over here! Come on!
I wouIdn't want my wife back from Indians.
Kindest thing, a buIIet in the brain.
WeII, I don't agree, and I want my wife back.
WeII, one of the Pawnee
Iocated a band of the vermin camped down the river.
We ride in the morning!
Is there any white women with them?
My advice to you is to get yourseIf a IittIe revenge on them bucks.
AII right. Spare the femaIes and chiIdren, if possibIe.
Let's go.
- (BARKING )
- (SCREAMING )
Hey! No!
Hey!
He said spare the women and chiIdren! Give me that!
- Let go of my rifIe.
- The heII I wiII!
You son of a bitch!
You bastard!
I'II kiII you.
lt was downright discouraging,
lf it wasn't lndians
trying to kill me for a white,
it was whites
trying to kill me for an lndian,
lt made me sick, Pawnee scouts
and soldiers was killing everything,
Aah!
Shadow! Brother, Iet's taIk.
Shadow...
I just took care of him.
I'm saving you for the hanging.
There is no describing how l felt,
An enemy had saved my life
by the violent murder
of one of my best friends,
The world was too ridiculous
even to bother to live in it,
That was why Shadow was there
and that was why he'd fought so hard,
l sat and watched that baby
come into this world,
Except for breathing,
that woman made no sound,
lf woman she was,
She didn't look more than a girl,
(BAB Y CRlES )
l couldn't take my eyes
off of that girl and her baby,
AII right, Iet's get the heII out.
Let the Pawnee cIean up.
Now, you Iisten to me.
If you are kin to Shadow, then you know of LittIe Big Man.
I was a friend of the Human Beings untiI they stoIe my wife.
Are you Shadow's wife?
His daughter?
Where's your husband?
KiIIed.
- What's your name?
- Sunshine.
I'm going to take you with me and trade you for my wife.
Near them bushes, Younger.
They're gone. Nobody here.
Let's get the heII out.
Wait here.
HeIIo, Grandfather.
Greetings, my son.
Do you want to eat?
Grandfather?
What happened to your neck?
It's a wound.
It cut the tunneI through which
Iight traveIs to the heart.
You're... You mean you're bIind?
Oh, no.
My eyes stiII see.
But my heart no Ionger receives it.
How did it happen?
White men.
- Where's BuffaIo WaIIow Woman?
- Rubbed out.
And White EIk Woman, too, and Dirt On The Nose, and High WoIf.
- And many others.
- And Burns Red?
Yes.
- Burns Red In The Sun?
- Rubbed out.
His wife, his chiIdren.
- And many more.
- Do you hate them?
Do you hate the white men now?
Do you see this fine thing?
Do you admire the humanity of it?
Because the Human Beings, my son, they beIieve everything is aIive.
Not onIy man and animaIs, but aIso water, earth, stone.
And aIso the things from them,
Iike that hair.
The man from whom this hair came, he's baId on the other side, because I now own his scaIp.
That is the way things are.
But the white men, they beIieve everything is dead: stone, earth, animaIs, and peopIe, even their own peopIe.
If things keep trying to Iive, white men wiII rub them out.
That is the difference.
You wiII stay with us, my son.
A year later, l was still with them,
After wandering all over
in constant danger of being killed
by white settlers or white soldiers,
we come to a place knowed
as the lndian Nations,
lt was a tract of land
by the Washita River
that had been give for ever
to the lndians
by the Congress and
the President of the United States,
We was safe there,
This was lndian land,,,
,,,as long as grass grow
and wind blow and the sky is blue,
Your new son's kicking a Iot today.
I think he wants to come out and see his father.
TeII him to wait untiI I finish my dinner.
I'II teII him, but I don't think he's going to wait much Ionger.
It's good I have a strong, brave husband who brings in so much food.
My strong husband brings in much more than we need.
There are many Human Beings here, many bands from many pIaces.
But it's sad. Many husbands have been rubbed out by the white man.
So women sIeep aIone and cry.
Be quiet now. I'm digesting.
Yes, but I think my sisters are here.
Your what?
My sisters. Digging Bear, LittIe EIk and Corn Woman. I think they're here.
What do you mean, you ''think'' they're here?
I beIieve they are. You bring in much more food than we need.
It is very sad. They have no husbands and they cry.
That's too bad. I'm sorry.
Digging Bear had a baby and Iost it, and so did Corn Woman.
- But LittIe EIk had no baby at aII.
- What do you want me to do about it?
I knew you'd understand.
lt was Old Lodge Skins' dream,
trying to come true,
l was determined
to stay out of them buffalo robes,
Three young and healthy women
with no man for who knows how long,
The very idea kind of shrunk me
like a spider on a hot stove,
Why, it's LittIe Big Man.
Oh, LittIe Big Man.
Younger Bear, it's LittIe Big Man.
He's not a contrary any more.
He has a wife.
She's pIump, she works hard, but she henpecks him.
Just when I think you're dead, you aIways come back.
Yes, and I aIways wiII, tiII you pay me the Iife you owe me.
I've heard you.
Now come to my tepee and eat.
We was caught
in Cheyenne hospitality,
I'm a very important man, more important than you.
I have a wife and four horses.
I have a horse and...
...four wives.
That may be, but my wife, she's a very good one.
See?
Oh, so there you are, you crawIing coyote.
What are we going to eat?
This starved duck?
Oh! Who's the beggar you brought to steaI what IittIe food we have?
CIean it! CIean it!
lt was Olga, l'd found her at last,
One duck.
Olga never did learn much English, but
she sure in hell had learned Cheyenne,
I just don't understand it.
UsuaIIy, this woman is gentIe as a dove.
My words were not the words to speak to a stranger. You stay and eat.
You see what a good wife she is?
It's because I'm a wonderfuI Iover.
Go in my tepee.
She wiII cook for you.
That's aII right. I'm not hungry.
You humiIiated him again.
Goodbye, Younger Bear.
You Iook tired, LittIe Big Man.
Do you want to come into my tepee and rest on soft furs?
Why don't you Iive with me and I'II be your wife?
Thank you for inviting me.
WeII, I've got to fix my hair to sing tonight.
Goodbye, LittIe Big Man.
Goodbye, LittIe Horse.
And so l finally found Olga,
But l had lost her long ago
to the Human Beings
and l saw no good reason
to reveal myself to her now,
Grandfather.
Why have you moved your tepee so far from our band?
The ponies are trying to teII me something.
Last night I had a dream.
The ponies were dying.
I heard them scream.
l'd learned to respect
Old Lodge Skins' dreams,
but for once we were in a safe place,
give to us by treaty,
Why do you hate my sisters?
I don't hate your sisters.
It's just that...
...the Great Spirit teIIs me...
Where are you going?
Your son won't wait any Ionger. He wants to come out and see his father.
Sunshine, lndian style,
was going off to have her baby,
As l watched her walk away,
it come over me that the Great Spirit
wanted me to go in that tepee,
Who wants to be first?
- Who is this here?
- It's me.
WeII, I guess you'II do as weII as any.
l figured she was the littlest one
and it would be easy,
But Lord help us,
them young girls is deadly,
However,
the Great Spirit was with me,
and l survived,
Only thing was, just as l was
about to drift off real peaceful,,,
No, you stay.
- Not yet.
- Maybe I can come back Iater.
ldle boasting, l assure you,
- Who's this here?
- It's me. Digging Bear.
Well, she wasn't called Digging Bear
for nothing, l can tell you that,
Stay here. Corn Woman's too tired.
She don't sound tired to me.
That's not her. That's LittIe EIk.
That's both of them.
LittIe EIk, you go to sIeep.
You too. Digging Bear...
Corn Woman, where are you?
l was lucky l come across her last,
The others, too?
Yes.
I knew you were a good man.
Here's your new son.
l reckon right then l come close
to turning pure lndian,
and l probably would have spent
the rest of my days
with Sunshine and her sisters,
- But sometimes grass don't grow,
- (WHINNYING )
wind don't blow
and the sky ain't blue,
Something's wrong with the ponies.
WoIves. Grandfather's...
Here. Go inside.
Don't Ieave the tepee.
- (WHINNYING )
- (RUMBLE OF HOOVES )
Grandfather, what's wrong with the ponies?
Don't you hear that, my son?
I wonder why I didn't see them in my dream.
Sunshine! Sunshine!
Grandfather, you've got to get inside.
Why bother, son?
It's a good day to die.
We've got to get to the river bank!
I am bIind. I cannot fight.
But I won't run.
If it's my day to die,
I want to do it here, within a circIe.
Grandfather, the river is part of the great circIe of the waters of the earth.
True, but the soIdiers wouId kiII us before we got to the river.
The soIdiers? Grandfather, you didn't see any soIdiers in your dream, and that means that they can't see you now.
- You think so?
- Yes! What eIse did your dream mean?
- I think you're right.
- Let's go to the circIe of the river!
I've never been invisibIe before.
- It's too Iate. We're cut off.
- It doesn't matter. We're invisibIe.
Grandfather, wait!
Grandfather!
lt sounds ridiculous, but the soldiers
never lifted a hand to stop us,
lt was so crazy,
they couldn't figure it out,
Maybe they thought
we was prisoners or friendlies,
since Old Lodge Skins
was grinning at them like a raccoon,
Or maybe we really was invisible,
All l knowed is we walked
right through them to the river,
CircIe the camp!
CircIe the camp, boys!
- That was extremeIy enjoyabIe.
- GIad you Iiked it, Grandfather.
Captain!
- Captain, shoot the Indian ponies.
- I beg your pardon, sir?
That is my decision.
Shoot the ponies.
- Sunshine.
- Yes, sir.
Young man, your seIf-righteous piety is commencing to annoy me.
- I didn't say anything.
- Shooting ponies shocks you?
Let me teII you, the women are more important than the ponies.
They breed Iike rats.
However, this is a IegaI action, and the men are under strict orders not to shoot the women.
UnIess, of course, they refuse to surrender.
- Isn't that correct?
- Yes, sir.
Sunshine!
Run! Run!
Run!
No! No!
- Where you going?
- Message for the GeneraI.
Wait a minute.
- What's that on your face?
- Mud, sir.
That's not mud. That's Indian paint.
And that's an Indian knife.
- What's your company?
- My company, sir?
Yes, and your commanding officer.
- What's the troubIe, Captain?
- We've got a renegade.
He's wearing Indian paint and he doesn't know his company.
- Take him away and hang him.
- GeneraI!
Don't you remember me?
I'm Jack Crabb, the muIe skinner!
- MuIe skinner?
- Yes. I appIied for a job as scout, but you couId teII my true occupation just by Iooking at me.
Yes, I beIieve I do remember that.
How did you become a renegade?
GeneraI, I ain't no renegade!
I was captured by the Cheyenne and heId prisoner!
Why, they took cactus thorns and stuck them in me!
But I just Iaughed and begged them to keep on doing it!
- You Iaughed?
- I Iaughed my head off.
Otherwise I wouIdn't be here.
GentIemen, it is difficuIt to admit to an error.
Captain.
Your summary judgement was whoIIy mistaken!
Aren't you gIad I questioned this man more cIoseIy?
Yes, sir.
PIease be more carefuI in the future, Captain.
- I'II drink the tea now, CorporaI.
- Yes, sir.
What are you doing up here, muIe skinner?
Nothing.
I just brought you tea, GeneraI.
And I...
...wanted to thank you again for sparing my Iife.
Why are you standing to the side?
Turn this way.
You came up here to kiII me, didn't you?
And you Iost your nerve.
WeII, I was correct in a sense.
You are a renegade, but you are no Cheyenne brave.
Custer was right,
l was a total failure as an lndian,
Do I hang you?
I think not. Get out of here.
- You're not going to hang me?
- Your miserabIe Iife is not worth a reversaI of a Custer decision.
That was the worst thing
he could have done to me,
There was nothing left
of my self-respect at all,
l couldn't go back to the lndians,
so l went back among the whites
and become a drunk,
Oh, you're a sad sight, Hoss.
You shouId have stuck to soda pop.
- How are things with you, BiII?
- Fine.
- I've changed my ways, Hoss.
- That's good.
Hey, BiII, I need a drink worse than the breath of Iife itseIf.
Here's $20. Get gIoriousIy drunk.
But first, go to the barber and have yourseIf a bath.
And buy some cIothes.
Then come see me in the saIoon.
One thing I do know, Hoss.
Any fooI can drink himseIf to death.
I'd Iike to ask you a confidentiaI favour.
It's a deIicate matter invoIving a widow.
She needs a train ticket out of town.
- You give her this.
- Sure, BiII.
You see, my new, beautifuI wife is vioIentIy jeaIous.
And this widow...
Oh, she's quite a widow.
- I think I know what you mean, BiII.
- Her name is LuIu Kane.
- Right now, BiII.
- Good.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
- BiII!
- He kiIIed my daddy!
He kiIIed my daddy! He ain't never going to shoot nobody again!
It took me seven years, but I got him!
- Who was he, anyhow?
- Some boy.
Hoss, you know that matter we discussed?
- The widow?
- Yes, BiII.
Don't teII my wife.
That'd reaIIy get me in troubIe.
You got me down in this goddamn water.
- (BELL)
- You quit it right now,
Come in, stranger.
Whatever it is you want, we've got it.
Mrs Pendrake?
You've mistaken me for someone eIse, stranger.
My name is LuIu.
Your name ain't LuIu.
You're Louise Pendrake.
- Who are you?
- Why, I'm Jack Crabb.
Mrs Pendrake, don't you remember me?
Jack Crabb?
My God.
Jack.
This is quite a pIeasant surprise.
This room is more commodious.
What have you been doing?
LuIu! What are you doing, sitting on your arse?
- A gentIeman is waiting.
- I have a gentIeman here, too.
Oh. I didn't see you, stranger.
Need anything?
If you do, just ring the beII.
Our motto here is: whatever you want, we've got it.
WeII, Jack. Now you know.
This is a house of iII fame, and I'm a faIIen fIower.
That widow hadn't lost her style
one bit,
A fallen flower,
Chokes me up to think about it,
This Iife is not onIy wicked and sinfuI.
It isn't even any fun.
No, I reckon not, Mrs Pendrake.
Yet, if I was married and couId come here once or twice a week, it might be fun.
But every night, it's just boring.
Oh, I can understand that.
I can't save any money.
If I couId just save a few doIIars,
I couId visit my maiden aunt in Washington.
I'd have cIothes, a carriage...
I might even marry a senator.
Oh! You'd make a good wife for a senator, Mrs Pendrake.
You aIways were a sweet boy.
Do you know, I often had wicked thoughts about you?
SeveraI times.
I aImost gave in to temptation.
And now, here we are.
Mrs Pendrake, what are you doing?
Do you know that, once,
I tiptoed into your room and stood over you for the Iongest time?
It was the most awfuI temptation to wake you up.
I wish that I had.
It wouId have been deIiciousIy wicked.
Is anything the matter, Jack?
- No.
- Then I'II wait for you in the...
...pIace of retirement.
You shouId have woke me up that night years ago, Mrs Pendrake.
This is from WiId BiII.
It was his Iast wish that you go and Iive with your maiden aunt.
His Iast wish was to save me?
Oh, Jack.
I must honour that wish.
You can do it, Mrs Pendrake.
Yes. I can, and I wiII.
I've got to go now.
Goodbye, Mrs Pendrake.
Oh, goodbye, Jack.
And thank you ever so much.
And, Jack...
If you're ever in Washington, do Iook me up.
- How are things, Mr Meriweather?
- SpIendid.
WeII, now, Iook at that.
BuffaIo hides.
There's a worId of money chewing grass on those pIains, Jack.
There goes BuffaIo BiII himseIf.
Yes, sir. MuItipIy that by thousands.
The buffaIo are getting scarce.
You were raised by Indians.
You shouId know how to track them.
We couId make a kiIIing, Jack.
- Haven't changed a bit, Jack.
- Neither have you.
You'd better watch out.
They're whittIing you down.
You can't afford to Iose any more of your parts.
Every business has a particIe of risk.
Bye, dear boy.
That was my low,
l had reached the bottom,
l become a hermit,
l went deep in the wilderness,
as far away as l could get,
Then one day, l found something
trappers see fairly regular,
An animal had gnawed off
its own foot to escape from a trap,
Something snapped in my head,
l decided life wasn't fit to live,
and the only thing to do was
to mingle with the twinkling stars,
Goodbye, Jack.
At that moment, l really was crazy,
and l was darn near off that cliff
when,,,
The time had come
to look the devil in the eye
and send him to hell
where he belonged,
The only question was
how to get him there,
Sergeant, take this man...
...and give him some cIothes.
This man wiII be invaIuabIe to me,
Major.
InvaIuabIe, sir?
I aImost hanged him as a renegade.
Now he asks to be a scout.
Oh, his game is very obvious: to Iead me away from his Indian friends.
WeII, I stiII don't quite foIIow you,
GeneraI.
Anything that man teIIs me wiII be a Iie.
Therefore, he wiII be a perfect reverse barometer.
- Isn't that correct?
- Of course, GeneraI.
ln my belief, Custer's hate
for the lndians and his ambition
had combined on him,
He figured he needed one more
dramatic victory over the lndians
to be nominated for
President of the United States,
That is a historical fact,
Men, hoId!
- We wiII take brief refreshment.
- Dismount!
Water break!
Oh, excuse me, Lieutenant.
It's the ceIibacy of the saddIe.
I had muscIe spasms aII night.
- Poison from the goonads.
- Poison from the what, sir?
Goonads. That's medicaI terminoIogy.
GeneraI, it's my duty as your...
The poison rises from the goonads and seeps down to the muscIes.
The Crows want to know if you're going down the Medicine TaiI CouIee.
- They do, do they?
- Yes, sir, they do.
They cIaim they want time to sing their death song.
TeII the Crows they're women.
But if the hostiIes come in behind us, and if they're waiting for us beIow, we'II never get out of there.
HostiIes behind us?
I see no hostiIes behind us.
Do you see any?
- No, sir, not at the moment.
- Then...
...stop trying to cause a reversaI of a Custer decision.
But, sir, wouIdn't it be best to send a squad down Medicine TaiI CouIee?
- No, it wouIdn't.
- May I ask, sir, why it wouIdn't?
Because it wouId cost us the vitaI eIement of surprise.
Surprise?
They know we're here.
But they don't know that
I intend to attack them without mercy.
- That's no surprise.
- Of course it is.
Nothing is more surprising than the attack without mercy.
GeneraI...
GeneraI, I must protest this impetuous decision.
A Custer decision, impetuous?
Grant caIIed me impetuous, too!
That drunkard, sitting there in the
White House, caIIing me impetuous!
GeneraI, I impIore you to reconsider.
Think of the men whose Iives depend upon you.
What shouId I do, muIe skinner?
Sir, that man doesn't know anything.
What do you say, muIe skinner?
ShouId I go down there, or withdraw?
l had him,
But this time what l held in my hand
wasn't a knife, but the truth,
WeII?
What's your answer, muIe skinner?
GeneraI, you go down there.
- You're saying, go into the couIee?
- Yes, sir.
There are no Indians there,
I suppose?
I didn't say that.
There are thousands of Indians down there, and when they get done with you, there won't be nothing Ieft but a greasy spot.
This ain't the Washita River, GeneraI, and them ain't heIpIess women and chiIdren waiting for you.
They're Cheyenne Brave, and Sioux.
You go down there if you got the nerve.
StiII trying to outsmart me, aren't you, muIe skinner?
You want me to think that you don't want me to go down there, but the subtIe truth is you reaIIy don't want me to go down there.
WeII, are you reassured now, Major?
Men of the Seventh!
The hour of victory is at hand!
Onward to LittIe Bighorn and gIory!
We've caught them napping!
Sound the charge!
We have them on the run!
Take no prisoners!
(BUGLE SOUNDS
ABOVE BATTLE NOISE)
Get off of your knees, men! Custer's with you! Custer's up! Stay with me!
What are they doing?
- Why aren't they charging?
- There's nowhere to charge to.
FooIs! They're shooting their own horses!
Arrest them! Arrest them!
- BugIer! Sound the charge!
- We've got to make breastworks!
I know aII about that, Major.
Don't try to teII me my business.
Make breastworks, men!
Show them no mercy!
I said, give them a voIIey!
- We're running out of ammunition.
- Right.
Now we are running out of ammunition.
I toId him this wouId happen.
But he just sat there in the White House and Iaughed at me.
That damned Cossack.
This is horribIe.
We're being wiped out!
Go on, Christian America!
Let your arrows fIy, savages!
I am unbowed!
Mr President!
Mr President, distinguished visitors, honoured members of the Senate, taking the Indian as we find him, waiting...
Why don't you shut up?
Mr President, you are drunk.
We can't have a man Iike you in the White House!
Get on your feet and face the enemy!
- Go away, GeneraI.
- AII right.
The sentence is death.
AII right. You and I are even at Iast.
I paid you the Iife I owe you, and, the next time we meet, I can kiII you without becoming an eviI person.
He goes to dance his joy.
Grandfather.
I am gIad to see you.
I'm gIad to see you, too, my son.
My heart soars Iike a hawk.
Do you want to eat?
I won't eat with you because I'm going to die soon.
Die, Grandfather?
Yes, my son.
I want to die in my own Iand, where
Human Beings are buried in the sky.
Why do you want to die, Grandfather?
Because there's no other way to deaI with the white man, my son.
Whatever eIse you can say about them, it must be admitted, you cannot get rid of them.
No, I suppose not, Grandfather.
There is an endIess suppIy of white men, but there aIways has been a Iimited number of Human Beings.
We won today.
We won't win tomorrow.
Snake Woman, get me my eIk buriaI robe.
Come, my son. We wiII go.
It makes my heart sad.
A worId without Human Beings has no centre to it.
Go where, Grandfather?
To the mountain, to the top.
Come out and fight.
It is a good day to die.
Thank you for making me a Human Being.
Thank you for heIping me to become a warrior.
Thank you for my victories and for my defeats.
Thank you for my vision and the bIindness in which I saw further.
You make aII things and direct them in their ways, O Grandfather.
And now, you have decided the
Human Beings wiII soon waIk a road...
...that Ieads nowhere.
I am going to die now, unIess death wants to fight.
And I ask you for the Iast time to grant me my oId power to make things happen.
Take care of my son here.
See that he doesn't go crazy.
(RAINDROPS FALL
ON OLD LODGE SKINS )
Grandfather?
Am I stiII in this worId?
Yes, Grandfather.
I was afraid of that.
WeII...
...sometimes the magic works, sometimes it doesn't.
Let's go back to the tepee and eat, my son.
My newest Snake wife cooks dog very weII.
AII right, Grandfather.
She aIso has a very soft skin.
The onIy troubIe with Snake women is they copuIate with horses, which makes them strange to me.
She says she doesn't. That's why
I caII her Doesn't Like Horses.
But, of course, she's Iying.
Of course, Grandfather.
Well, that's the story
of this old lndian fighter,
That's the story of the Human Beings,
who was promised land
where they could live in peace,
Land that would be theirs
as long as grass grow,
wind blow,
and the sky is blue,
Mr Crabb, l didn't know,
Get out, get out.

ENGLISH SDH
THE DECAMERON
Don't kill me!
Who's that?
Andreuccio. I knew him as a boy, and his father as well, the richest man in my village.
A great lord!
Now he lives near Rome.
His son has come to Naples to buy horses.
Look at this! Stop frowning!
Hello!
- Please, sir!
- Me?
A pretty lady wants to see you.
- With all my heart!
- Then come with me.
She's waiting for you.
- Go!
- Follow me.
Please.
- Welcome, Andreuccio!
- The pleasure is all mine.
Andreuccio, come.
Let us sit down here.
You must be surprised that I welcome you, kiss you and weep.
You will be even more surprised to learn that we are brother and sister.
Your father, Pietro, met a rich widow in Palermo.
She loved him and sacrificed her honour for him.
I was born of this love.
Our father left and returned to Rome.
He abandoned us and forgot about us.
He left me as worthless!
I grew up with my mother.
A noble woman.
She married me off to a gentleman of Guelph.
But he was secretly in league with King Charles, and King Frederick found out, and chased us out of Palermo, just when I was about to become a great lady.
Luckily, King Charles came to our rescue.
He gave land and money to my husband, your brother-in-law.
Thank God I have found you, dear brother!
I'm happy to have a sister,
I've been lonely.
What can you do?
Not all evil leads to harm.
But Dad...
I didn't know he was like that, but when a man is young...
I understand, I too came here to...
- Anyway, thank you, dear sister!
- Now let us celebrate!
Make yourself comfortable.
You can spend the night here, and leave tomorrow morning.
Naples is unsafe at night.
- Good night, dear brother!
- Good night, sister!
If you need anything, ask the boy.
- My dear brother...
- Good night!
- Good night! Thank you, sister.
- Good night!
Boy, where's the...
Privy? Over there.
Help!
I've fallen into the shit!
It's disgusting!
Let me in, sister!
Who's knocking down there?
Andreuccio, the brother of the Sicilian lady!
You're drunk, go to bed!
I've never heard of an Andreuccio, go!
Is this how Sicilians treat brothers?
Toss down my clothes and money, at least!
My good man, you're mad!
To hell with you!
You lout, disturbing women at this hour!
Be gone, or you'll be killed!
Go back to where you belong!
Go away! Leave!
What do you want, disturbing my sister like this?
Be gone!
I've never smelled a worse stink!
Shit.
- Who are you?
- I am Andreuccio.
I'm not from these parts.
I came to Naples to buy horses.
I met a lady who said she was my sister.
She invited me to supper.
I fell into her privy, and here I am.
So they robbed you.
Now I understand!
Thank the Madonna for losing your money.
What?
Because that's life.
And thank God for falling into the shit.
Say thank you!
- Thanks be to God.
- Thank God again for bringing you here.
You'll soon have as much money as there are stars in heaven.
We've taken pity on you.
Look. We've got a job for you.
It will bring you more than you have lost.
- You in?
- I'm in.
- Minutolo died yesterday.
- He was the Archbishop of Naples.
His tomb is over there.
He's dressed in his rich robes.
Above all, he wears a ruby worth 500 gold florins.
Be brave, lift the lid.
- Who'll go in?
- Not me.
Not me, either. You, Andreuccio.
- No, I'm afraid.
- What?
Get in, or by the Madonna,
I swear I'll beat you to death!
In! Get in!
Get in! Come on!
How ugly you are!
Where's the ring?
No rings here!
- Where's the ring?
- Where is it?
No rings here!
- Are you sure?
- Of course! There's no ring.
Really?
Get stuffed!
Courage.
Wake up! Are you made of lead?
Get going!
- I won’t go in, I'm afraid.
- You're afraid now?
What kind of robbers are you?
There's a valuable ruby in there.
I'm your sacristan, trust me.
What are you afraid of?
Dead men don't bite. I'll get in.
"Once upon a time in Lombardy,
"where the Tuscan tongue is spoken,
"there was a convent famous for chastity and piety.
"Among the nuns
"was a noble young lady of great beauty."
Now I'll tell it in Neapolitan!
What happened in this convent, was that a very beautiful nun loved a handsome youth and would wait for night to let him into her cell.
But the other nuns found out and were jealous, and caught them in the act.
What did they do?
They went to the Mother Superior.
She was in bed with a priest.
She was so flustered, she mistook the priest's drawers for her veil, and opened the door with them on her head!
She went and knocked on the young nun's door while the sisters watched.
The nun came out and said:
"So you had fun, too:
The priest's drawers are on your head!"
After that, all the nuns enjoyed themselves.
Work should feed us, not kill us.
I used to work at the convent on the hill.
Those nuns! They never gave me a moment's peace.
"Put this down, pick this up!"
I had to take my hoe and dig, dig, dig wherever they said.
And they were all so pretty,
I was beside myself!
New the sacristan says to send another gardener, an old man, they can't employ a young man at the convent.
I wouldn’t send anyone there!
Young or old, no one can stand it there!
Where can I find another old man?
A young man's no good, the sacristan's right:
Because those nuns are possessed by the devil!
You did well to leave.
It's bad for men to be surrounded by women.
I'm the bursar.
What do you want, who are you?
Speak!
What is it? Speak!
You can't talk?
You're hungry?
Wait.
Who is this?
Mother, he's a poor mute.
He can't talk. He wants to work.
He could be our gardener.
He's all muscle and no brain.
Let's keep him.
Give him shoes and an old shirt.
Treat him well, feed him well.
- Who is he?
- A deaf-mute, can't hear or speak.
A man in our convent? Sisters!
He can't hear, but he can eat!
He can wag his jaw!
So you like the soup made by us, poor little nuns!
Sister.
Can you keep a secret?
It's something that has often occurred to me.
You might like to hear it.
I swear I won’t tell.
Every woman who visits us says that there's no greater pleasure than what a man does with a woman.
This is my plan:
I'd like to try with the deaf-mute, to learn if what they say is true.
There's no risk with him, he's a simpleton.
He can't tell anyone.
What do you think?
What are you saying?
Don't you know we've pledged our virginity to God?
We make God many promises we can't keep!
What if he got us pregnant?
Why anticipate nothing but trouble?
Every ill has a remedy.
What shall we do?
In the afternoon, all the others are asleep at this hour.
This is what we'll do...
We'll lead him to that hut, taking turns while the other stands guard.
Get down! Come with us!
Hurry! Come!
Come!
Good lad.
In you go!
Now mount me! Come!
Don't you see? Don't you understand?
Make love!
Come on, animal.
Well done. Come here.
It's heaven, sister!
What they say is true!
Now you try!
- I'd never have guessed!
- Don't tell a soul!
Every day, only you and me, sister!
That's the way. It's heaven!
- What shall we do?
- Tell Mother Superior! An outrage!
Yes, let's!
What's the hurry?
Think it over, sisters.
Why let only two enjoy what we can all share?
In you go!
Up! Come with me.
Come here! Obey!
Get on top of me.
Don't you see? Are you blind?
Come.
Make love to me.
Come on, show me.
Don't stop. What's the matter, fool?
You haven't finished. Keep going.
More!
One cock may satisfy ten hens, but ten men cannot satisfy one woman!
I have to satisfy nine! I'll leave, if we can't find another way.
I thought you were a deaf-mute!
No, I came here to do just this.
And how much I've done!
I'd no idea how hard it was.
A miracle!
What?
You're a miracle!
It's a miracle, sisters!
Don't worry, we'll arrange things so you can stay in the convent and satisfy us all without killing yourself.
What's more, you'll be a saint. Miracle!
God has given speech to the gardener!
Come.
My love...
Peronella!
My husband. He'll kill me!
I've heard, I'm coming!
See how well she locks herself in.
God be praised
I have such a virtuous wife.
I'm coming. I heard you!
Let's go! Go down, quick!
I'm coming!
Get into the jar! He's so jealous!
Stay there, don't move.
Why is he back so soon?
He could have seen you come in!
Here I am!
That cuckold!
And I was almost finished.
I'm coming!
Back already? I'll kill you!
If you don't work, how can we eat?
I'm tired of pawning my clothes.
I sweat blood, sewing all day!
My nails are down to the quick!
Husband!
The day will come when I lose my patience with you!
And you saunter home when you should be at work!
I'm so unfortunate, my God...
See what a good wife I have.
But don't be angry.
It's Saint Galeone's Day, a holiday.
That's why I'm back.
I've got a buyer for the big jar.
Be happy!
We'll have bread for a month!
He'll pay five denari.
That's why I'm angry.
You're a man, and you sell it for five denari.
I'm a woman, at home all day, and I've sold it for seven to a young man who has just called.
He's inside looking at it now.
Sorry, my friend, my wife has sold it for seven.
Let's go down.
Let's thank Saint Galeone for sending you home.
Where are you, good woman?
I'm coming. Isn't it a fine jar?
You offered five.
My wife has sold it for seven!
Here I am.
Who are you?
I was dealing with a woman.
I am her husband.
It's good, but dirty inside.
It's encrusted, it won’t soak off with water.
That won’t stop us from selling it!
My husband will get inside and clean it as good as new.
Give me my scourer.
Laugh, husband, you've made a good profit!
Laugh!
The buyer is right!
The jar stinks!
Scour it clean.
Let's do things properly.
Higher... lower...
That's the spot!
It's still dirty there.
Take your time, it's a good deal.
My love...
Keep it up, that's the way!
Where else could anyone find a husband like you?
Things aren't going well for you.
You did the best you could do.
You forged what could be forged,
You killed, you raped women.
You blasphemed God and the saints.
You're even a bit queer.
In short, my boy, isn't it time to vanish for a while?
Perhaps.
There's a problem
I can't handle myself.
I've a large debt to collect in the north, but my debtors are so evil that perhaps only you can collect it, by hook or by crook.
- Will you?
- Yes.
I'll give you credentials.
You'll be the guest of two brothers from these parts,
I'll give you their address.
They'll treat you well.
For my sake, not yours.
Don't worry.
No-one knows you up north.
- Farewell, Master.
- Farewell, Ciappelletto.
Bring back the money!
My dear Ciappelletto, don't expect spaghetti here.
Here we eat the German way!
Can I pour you some wine?
Cheers!
How many people will soon be miserable here?
Why?
Because with your reputation, those poor debtors...
Do you think you're better than me?
You leeches, ghouls!
You vermin!
Filth!
Usurers!
- Have you gone mad?
- Only joking!
We're all Neapolitans!
Let's stick together, for better or for worse.
You're right!
Naples, my home.
To leave Naples is to long for her.
What do we do now?
We can't put him out!
People would gossip, after we received him so well.
New he's dying, we can't put him out!
You're right, we'd be criticized.
He's no good, he's never confessed, never taken Communion.
People are right, he'll die like a dog.
I shudder to think what his confession would be like!
For such sins as his, there is no confessor!
No one could absolve him.
He'll die like a dog.
Fellows, come here!
I don't want to make trouble for you;
I heard what you said.
I agree, things could happen as you say.
But I won’t let them.
In my life, I have sinned so often, that one more sin before I die won't make any difference.
So go and seek out the most pious priest in the city and bring him to confess me.
I'll do the rest, don't worry.
In the Name of God, will someone come?
A man is dying.
Send us your most pious priest!
It was a lovely meal, Father, with wine, ham, all the trimmings.
Yes, Father, it was lovely!
He was in such good spirits, poor man!
We sang, all three of us.
If there's bad luck, it's always for us!
Poor Ciappelletto!
What will become of you?
Madonna, have mercy.
Have you been guilty of avarice?
Don't blame me if I'm in the house of usurers.
- The whore's son!
- To hell with you!
I had a great inheritance.
I gave it all to the poor.
Of what I earned,
I kept but half to live on, giving the other half to the poor.
Tell me, if you will:
Have you ever sinned with a woman?
He's queer!
I'm as pure as the day I was born.
God bless you!
And the sin of gluttony?
In thought. While fasting,
I had strong cravings for lettuce.
Lettuce? My son, these are sins of no account.
There are many other sins
I have not told you about!
- What are they?
- One day, it happened that I spat in the House of the Lord!
My son, that is nothing.
We, priests, spit in there every day.
What else?
My father, there is one sin
I have never confessed.
I'm so ashamed!
What do you mean, my boy?
I cry whenever I think of it.
I'm sure God will never forgive me!
God always forgives sins, when a man as sincere as you repents.
My sin is too serious.
You are so kind to pretend that God forgives me.
Confess! We shall pray together.
- I can't, Father.
- Come, my son!
I can't!
My son, make an effort.
- In the name of God!
- No.
Very well. Promise to pray with me and I will tell.
When I was a little boy,
I cursed my mother over a little milk!
My own mother!
He's dying, and doing all this for us.
He really is a saint.
Even if you had helped to nail Him to the Cross, you're so deeply sorry that He would forgive you.
What did you say, Father?
My dear mother, who carried me for nine months, day and night, for nine months, in her womb...
I have heard the poor sinner's confession and listened as his noble heart broke with anguish.
Yet his faith in our Mother Church never wavered.
If you wretches as much as step on a twig, you offend God, the Madonna and the Heavenly Host.
Now you may enter.
Enter and honour this saint.
END OF THE FIRST PART
SECOND PART
Let's take shelter!
Stop! Let's stop here!
- Come on, run!
- I'm coming!
My God, we could drown in all this water!
Please, after you.
Gennaro, did you pray for this rain?
Well, you got it!
God never refuses me.
Let me introduce the Master, who does not like being called Master.
He's a good painter from the north,
Giotto's best pupil.
He has come to paint Naples.
I am most honored, Master!
Have you anything to keep off the rain?
We'd like to be in Naples by nightfall.
Do you have something?
I have only a few rags, but you can use them.
Thank you.
The rain won't stop!
Have a good journey!
Master, do you think that if a stranger saw you... in this state... he'd imagine that you are one of our best painters?
They're from the church that commissioned the work.
And these are nuns of the convent.
This way, please.
Try these grapes, they're excellent!
- To Riccardo's health!
- To your health, sir!
Apples, oranges, as many flowers as there are in France, for Caterina, for Giuseppina, and new you're out!
Caterina, don't let me die of love.
Don't you make me die of love.
I'll do what you want.
Say the word, and save my life and yours.
Riccardo, you know how they watch me; at least we can talk here.
But if you want to sleep with me, tell me what to do.
I won't be ashamed,
I'll do as you ask.
Caterina, go to sleep on your balcony, over the garden.
I'll climb the wall.
If you're brave enough to climb so high,
I'll find a way to sleep there.
It's so hot...
Mamma, I couldn't sleep last night.
But it's not too hot.
It's quite cool in fact!
But you forget that girls are much warmer than older women.
True, but what can we do?
If you and Papa agree,
I'll put a bed on the balcony, over the garden.
I'll sleep there.
In the cool air, I'll listen to the nightingale singing, and will sleep better than in your room.
Very well, I'll speak to your father.
Let's see what he says.
Caterina, wake up!
Caterina, my love.
Give me my first ever kiss!
Later. Lie down.
- Riccardo, my love.
- Let's do it again!
Let's sleep a little.
Let's ask Caterina how she slept with her nightingale.
My God.
Wake up! Look at your daughter, how she caught her nightingale!
- How can that be?
- Come with me.
- What are you saying?
- See for yourself.
If she's had him, he's hers.
A fine boy, good family, rich...
It's an ideal match!
Ours is a respectable house.
If he wants to live, he must marry her, and make no trouble.
He'll put his nightingale in her cage, and in no-one else's!
Wake up, miserable pair!
Let's settle this, before I call my guards!
Sir, please forgive me.
I did wrong and deserve to die.
Do what is right and honorable for you.
If you can forgive me, don't kill me.
Riccardo, this is no way to repay my trust in you.
But you erred because you are young.
To avoid death for you and shame, calling for bloodshed, for me,
I ask you to marry Caterina.
Of course I'll marry her!
She'll be my wife!
And you'll be my father and mother-in-law!
Give me the ring.
Here, Caterina.
In the Name of God, I wed thee.
Now rest. I'm sure you need it.
He's still not here. These artists!
Excuse me.
Excuse me, brothers.
To work, lads!
Come on, quick! Let's go!
Stay a little longer.
I must go, it's dawn.
Stay, Lorenzo.
I wish I could.
Good-bye till tomorrow.
Brothers! Get up!
What's happened?
Our sister Isabetta is sleeping with the Sicilian apprentice.
I saw him leave her room.
I'll kill her!
Stop! What are you doing?
Stop it! Have you gone mad?
What are you doing?
Are you sure of this?
Absolutely.
Let's pretend we don't know.
Don't say anything.
Hide our shame.
We'll wait for an opportunity, without telling anyone.
That's what we’ll do!
Enough work for today.
Let's go for a walk.
It's such a lovely day.
Sister, we’re going for a walk.
Be good.
Have a piss with us!
It doesn't cost anything!
Make room for our boy.
Did you think we weren’t human?
You wore wrong.
We're just like other men, see?
How that Lorenzo can run!
Where are you going?
We're coming! We'll catch you.
Let's rest for a while.
This is the coolest spot on our land.
Sit down, Lorenzo. Let servants and masters be equal today.
Wash your eyes, refresh yourself!
Come on, jump.
Come along.
Come on then!
What are you doing? Run that way.
Run!
Why?
Come on, run that way.
What's wrong?
Brothers, I'm sorry to disturb you.
- What do you want?
- Is Lorenzo back yet?
We sent him away to Palermo on business.
Ask again, and you'll get the answer you deserve.
Go indoors Isabetta.
And don't come out without our permission.
Go!
Don't make us say it again!
You're sad because I've been gone so long.
You keep calling me, crying.
I can never come back again.
The last day you saw me, your brothers killed me.
They buried me out there.
Don't wait or call for me anymore.
Brothers,
I've been indoors for so long.
Give me permission to walk with the maid.
Go, enjoy yourself!
Go! But come back soon.
And cheer up, we like to see you cheerful.
I wish I could take all of you, my love.
It's basil from Salerno, the best.
We'll sprinkle him with rose water.
Come on, we’ve a long way to go yet.
What a long way we’ve come together!
From market to market, just to earn a bit of bread.
We must be near to your home now, from the way you described it to me.
Yes. At last I can repay your hospitality, Don Gianni.
Thank you, Pietro.
But don't expect a house as nice as yours!
There's only room for me,
Gemmatta and the donkey.
But at least you have a pretty wife.
Thanks.
Yes, I do have a pretty young wife, but...
We'll manage somehow.
My wife and I have it planned:
She will sleep at Zita's house, our neighbour.
Zita doesn't mind.
That way you and I can use our bed.
What's wrong?
We're unlucky, dear Pietro.
What shall we do?
Zita has just got married.
They're celebrating at her house.
She would get married today.
Where can we put our friend, the priest?
I can't go to Zita's with her stupid husband there.
Don Gianni, this is my wife,
Gemmatta.
I'm honored.
God be with you.
Don't worry, dear Gemmatta,
I'll be fine.
Whenever I like,
I cast a magic spell and turn my mare into a pretty girl.
I sleep with her, then change her back, and use the mare for my work.
No matter what,
I'll never part from her.
All cuckolds!
- What do you want?
- If the priest is a good friend...
What?
Ask him to show you the trick, that magic spell.
Turn me into a mare.
The mare and the donkey will carry everything.
I'll be a good, obedient mare.
We'll earn twice as much. And at home
I'll turn into a woman again.
What do you say?
Yes, yes.
Show us how to turn my wife into a mare and back into a woman again.
I can't...
I beg you in God's name.
See how poor we are.
Do it out of charity.
It won't cost you anything!
You really believe I can do it?
Yes!
I will show you how to do it early tomorrow morning.
The hardest part of it all, as you'll see, is pinning the tail on.
Remember, no one else in the world would do what I'm doing for you.
I'm doing it because you insist.
If you want the miracle to happen, do exactly as I say.
Pietro, watch me closely.
Don't forget what I tell you.
Be sure not to spoil it all.
No matter what you see or hear, don't say a single word.
I'll be as mute as a fish.
Pray to God that the tail hooks on properly.
Come on, Gemmatta.
Strip naked.
Quite naked?
As naked as a newborn babe.
Come, get undressed.
Get down like a mare.
You hold this lantern.
Let this be a pretty mare's head.
Let this be a pretty mare's hair.
Let these be a pretty mare's arms.
Let these be a pretty mare's flanks.
Let these be a pretty mare's breasts.
And let this be... a pretty mare's tail!
I don't want the tail!
What have you done?
I told you not to say a word!
I don't want the tail!
You've ruined it by speaking.
Now it's impossible.
We're in for it, if we die in mortal sin.
We're saved if we repent just before we die.
What sort of a place do we go to after death?
Who knows, Meuccio?
What will heaven or hell be like,
Tingoccio?
Again! You want to see me dead, is that it?
Who knows? I may die first.
The Lord decides.
- Hey, Meuccio.
- What?
Let's make a promise:
The one who dies first lets the other know what it's like.
- Yes!
- Swear!
- I swear it.
- So do I.
I'm in mortal sin because of you.
Me, too, because of you.
Because we're lovers, you and me.
If a woman commits a mortal sin with a man, then he commits a mortal sin with her.
Holy Virgin, forgive us!
What's one sin more or less?
Let's do it again.
- You're as pale as a corpse.
- You're crazy.
If you keep it up like that, you'll be sorry.
I'm telling you, fool that I am, for your own sake.
Don't you think about it?
I like lovemaking, too, and I could do it any time, but I value my salvation.
After death, I want my soul to be without sin before God.
To think I told him so,
I kept on telling him.
"Two or three times, that's all."
I said.
He was stubborn, wouldn’t listen.
Month after month he did it:
Five, six, seven, eight, nine times a day, he never stopped, poor Tingoccio!
Look where he is now.
Meuccio.
Who is it?
Tingoccio. I promised to tell you what it's like after death.
Welcome back. Are you saved, or are you a lost soul?
If I was lost, how could I be here?
That's not what I mean.
I mean, are you with the damned in the fires of hell?
Not yet, but I'm paying for my sins.
I'm suffering a heavy sentence.
Is it the same punishment for all?
No. Some are burning, some in boiling water, some in ice, some in shit.
Tell me, can I do anything for you here on earth?
Of course!
Have masses said, and prayers.
Be charitable, that helps a lot.
Don't worry, I'll do as you say.
I must go, it's almost dawn.
Farewell. Take care.
Wait!
A question.
How were you punished for all your lovemaking?
Well, Meuccio, when I arrived,
I met someone who knew every one of my sins.
I thought I'd get the worst punishment for my lovemaking.
I was shaking with fear.
Someone asked why I was shaking and I said:
"I'm guilty of awful sins with my woman."
"That's why I'm here now."
They laughed at me, saying:
"Don't worry, that 'sin' doesn't count here."
I must go now. Be good.
It's not a sin!
Here's the wine!
Let's all have a drink!
Let's drink!
To your health!
To the Master's health!
A great work for our city!
To your health! Thank you, friends.
Good luck with your next work,
Master.
This good wine is the spirit of Saint Antonio!
I wonder...
This wine is bliss for us to piss!
Why produce a work of art when it's nice to just dream about it?
Blasted Blacks!
The best of them are a likely to disappear at any time!
If a person could be certain that he had imbued one of them with a decent ambition!
I thought Jimmie... he's half white.
Why did he disappeared now that I'm needing him?
He knows I needed him.
He's around.
He knows I needed him for the Easter choir.
Possuming, probably.
NNNNNNNN
Horaires des offices religieux.

Any post that's out by more than an inch, will cost you a shilling.
Fair enough boss.
Apart from that...
...we should get along alright.
We've got a Federal government my friend.
It'll pass a law to give to every single wingeing bloody pommie his fare home to England.
Back to the smoke St John and ten days a year of sun and the shit in the streets. You can have it.
Your attitude towards England is inflammatory.
What a pity you've never been there.
A pity you didn't fuckingwell stay there.
Hey Jacko?
I don't know about fences boss.
What d'you wanna know about it?
What sort of wood to use? What you do to them before you put them in the ground.
You see Boss, I got a contract, and I wanna do a fucking good job.
No language in here.
Beg your pardon, Boss.
That's a word the glorious english created to describe what they mainly do to choir boys.
Anyhow, it's not to be stolen by sepoys, gyppoes or boongs, you understand Jacko?
I'm recording every word Carmichael.
Hey Jacko, what would you say of a
New Zealand Maori or a Canadian Redskin who say he wanted to fucking well know about fences.
I'd say he's a fucking foul mouth boss.
Get out... that's it Carmichael.
Here Jacko... you do read don't you?
Course I read.
That's not too bad at all.
Coming, coming.
Jimmie!
Morning boss, Miss.

It oughter be 12 shillings more, boss.
I'm not denying it.
Two quids is all you're getting.
12 of them posts 3 inches out, one of them by more than 4 inches.
Not by my rule, boss.
It's my rule that counts.
Well, posts are solid boss, rails cut good, can you give me a reference?
BeJesus you're a fussy bloody black.
What you reference is for?
A job in the bank?
So I can show to other people who want fence a stuff.
I haven't got me writing glasses.
And I want you off the property by ten in the morning.
Can I get a ride into Merriwa and use the dray?
I got a lot of pieces to carry.
We're not going to Merriwa tomorrow.
I was thinking you might, it being friday.
I don't need you to think for me!
I'd ask you if I wanted you to do me thinking!
Yeah, thanks a lot boss.
No reference, that's cause you can't bloody write!
What animal has your soul, you black bitch?
Don't, Jimmie!
I've been killing lots of animals lately.
Jimmie, you stop that!

Tired?

Horse, sleep in the stables.
No boots.
Fair enough boss.
You can get them out of the seven and six...
...if you want to pretend you're a gentleman.
United States had trouble enforcing the Federation.
What you want? Civil war, thousands of dead...
It won't happen here, make an Australian shoot at Australians.
After federated... a common purpose.
Common front, all would be better off.
Except for you Jacko.
Wouldn't be any better for you, would it?
What's that Mister Farrell?
Federation.
Federation, good thing boss.
Free trade between the states, new laws.
Good thing for Australians.
Yeah, but not for you black bastards.
We're many different from you.
I suppose it still have the same rights.
None.
NNNNNNNN
Well, not now that you've left to be worth worrying about anyway, Jacko!
Jack Fisher!
We inquired of you at the time and you mentionned nothing about the darkies camp.
I thought it'd be better for Jack's father, if he knew Jack had disappeared in that manner.
I mean they're a very respectable family.
Look, since Mr Fisher's dead now...
You were out there too and didn't want to get yourself in the trouble from your father.
No, that wasn't the reason.
Were you out there?
Come on!
It's obvious.
Alright.
Now this is serious.
You knew he gone fucking gins.
And didn't want to tell us, did you?
I was worried about old Fisher's health.
But we'll find out all about it.
And when we do, you can tell
Merriwa all about courting gins.
But I've got a fiancée.
Well you'd better get her in the family way, aren't you?
So she can't back out.
Go! Go get me some!
A man, may be get killed... by black fellow.
We don't kill a white fellow.
I mean he may be get killed by some bloody Verona black.
I mean he may be buried round the place close.
Bloody darkie too lazy bury him far away.
That man not bury around here.
Come on where you bury him?
You joked Policeman Farrell and
Policeman Farrell

Mister Farrell.
This boy he says Harry Edwards had fight with white fellow.
Put a bloody knife in him he said.
Where this Harry Edwards live?
We're famous Jimmie.
Full story in the Sydney Herald.
All the details, even mentionned you, your black.
Kept quite a figure at the funeral.
Mrs Fisher give us a reward.
A reward! Us?
We're a team, aren't we?
It's not much...but it's sunday...
Here Jacko.
You deserve it.
Showed a lot of talent...know your place.
Take your orders an get on with it.
Keep improving yourself.
Not like them lazy Verona's bastards.
- Hey, Mister p'liceman, Mr p'liceman!
- What?
What for you leaving him Harry to Mr Farrell?
You murdered white boy.
Hey, Mister Farrell is going to do something bad to him, Harry.
You ought to have something bad on to you.
I had to knife him white boy.
White boy gone mad.
Beaten up Harry's woman.
Smashin'up things.
Still you got enough of this, too bloody sharp.
They'll hang Harry certain as all shit.
What for you lend your wife?
White fellow don't lend his wife to anybody.
Christ! Don't leave!
Don't want him Farrell mucking round with me!
Harry Edwards hung himself with his belt.
While I'm away I want you to cut him down.
Take his clothes off and burn them.
Also to wash him.
Wrap him in a blanket, head and all.
There'll have to be an inquest.
What should I get sheep shit all over your gum boots you Jacko!
Yeah, thought all of you darkies went bare footed!
Yeah, so you can bugger off without anyone hearing you's.
Pretty unusual blacks wearing boots.
Why are you wearing boots, Jacko?
Since I don't get sheep shit all over me feet.
Dum bastard boss!
NNNNNNN away dum bastard!
Mister cook, Jimmie Blacksmith at your service!
Jesus Christ!
We need some water for the potatoes.
If you want to be a service.
Alright boss.
I told you they would, those bloody Boers they'll get what for now?
Declared war, you'll not get anywhere without the help of us Australians.
They call for volunteers they can get.
Fancy gone over there to get shot for the help of a bunch of bloody poms.
It's for your queen and country.
Think of the glory.
It's not our bloody country, is it Jacko?
It's your queen and still your mother country.
Not for long.
Declared war, what does that mean, boss?
It means that England having tried to persuade the Boers to cease their axe of antagonism, and to convince them that
- their treatment of the blacks...
- Means that they can officially shoot the Blacks...
It means that England has been left with no outer and they hope that military might will prevail where common sense fails.
Kill'em, mine'em or whatever.
To agree with you or leave your life.
- Ready for a walk?
- Yeah.
- Hi Mr Newby.
- Hi Jimmie.
- Top should be finished Mr Newby.
- I noticed.
What you think of me house?
Looking good?
It's come along fine.

And I'm really thankful for you let me do this Mr Newby.
How are you planning on getting that fiancée of yours up here?
Train to Litgow boss and then train to Gilgandra.
You're not gonna walk all the way from Gilgandra to here?
I don't know what to do Mister Newby.
Rather take my second girl's hack.
Just walk him.
Just for her mind.
You'll have to leave him in Gilgandra.
Thanks boss.
Quick! Get it! Hurry up now!
Just you watch it!
Come, Peter, nice throw...
Oh no! He's missed it!
You're attention now!
Run you silly bugger, run!
Come on back again, Peter!
Mr Blacksmith?
Would you like some greens?
Yes Mrs.
Sandwich?
Thanks.
I understand you're going to marry a white girl Mister Blacksmith.
Yes, Miss.
She could cook.
Serve the table.
Very nice.
She knows where a person's soup spoon ought to be.
Really?
Is she all white Mister Blacksmith?
Yes, Miss.
Really?
You give us this woman, to be married to this man.
I do.
Take her right hand in your right hand, and repeat after me.
I call upon these persons here present, to witness...
That I, Jimmie Blacksmith.
To take the Gilda Marshall.
To be my lawful wedded wife.
What does the reverend's wife talked to your head.
Stuff I didn't think any parson's wife would know.
What's sort of stuff?
- How to avoid having babies.
- None of her business.
That's what I thought, but you can't say nothing.
You're alright?
Not the best. I think I try side-saddle.
Let me help.
It's the start.
We're going to town for groceries every fridays, if you could leave me a list of the things you need, I'll purchase them for you, you can pick them up saturdays.
Thanks Mrs Newby.
Looking after yourself, are you?
No trouble with swollen ankles or sore veins?
No.
You can have the little one at my place.
We got a big range and lots of linen.
Thanks.
We'll see if he takes care of you.
If he beats you, or hurts you, you can come straight to me.
He wouldn't do anything like that.
Would you like some NNN dearest?
Yeah thanks!
You've done a lot Jimmie.
The Newby owes us 15 pounds.
It's all my pain.
Shouldn't carry things all the way up here.
I'm alright dearest.
Push! Push now! Push!
Jesus!
Hey Jimmie, has it come?
Yeah!
What is it Jimmie?
Where is the poor little father?
Congratulations Jimmie.
Leave you rather with a real genuine white.
Mr Blacksmith.
I wanna show you your son.
Will you behave yourself, Jimmie?
Christ Mrs, I'm ain't a savage.
Alright, come on.
Mr Blacksmith.
I would like to show you the boy child your wife has given birth to.
What do you think of him,
Mister Blacksmith?
Alright, we can all laugh now.
I had the right to think it was my kid.
Jimmie, hey, come here!
Come for booze?
Well, I haven't got any!
Halam marry Mankara,
Mankara marry Gary,
You, marry white girl,
Bad torum.
Tooth to keep you safe.
It'll keep me safe for...
Here it is! Found it!
Alright...
It's good of you to go to the trouble.
It's a long walk to come.
Gilda this is my kin.
Tabidgi my uncle. Mort my brother, and Peter my cousin.
Was a little far right?
Must be plenty of white fellow.
I really thought it was yours, Jimmie.
Honnest, I was sure.
Grow up to be fucking white know all.
Won't want to know me when he grows up.
I was sure it was yours, Jimmie.
I wouldn't have done it to you.
Honnest.
It should be, little bugger.
G'day Mrs Blacksmith, can I do something for you?
I just came to giving me orders.
I'm sorry I spoke to your husband.
I told him I can't go on forwarding him advances in the form of groceries.
Not since the place has turned into a blacks camp.
I'm never certain whether the work will get done or not.
I don't wanna be left with an unfinished boundary.
I made that clear to your husband
Mrs Blacksmith.
The cure is in his hands.
Sorry Mister Newby.
Hold on!
You look a bit done in.
Go inside the kitchen and get yourself a cup of tea.
Thanks Mister Newby.
Baby should wake in about an hour, give him some soup
I could do that Mrs Newby.
No dear you should be in bed.
Mrs Blacksmith.
Mr Newby said you might have some tea.
Come in. I wasn't expecting you here this week,
Mr Newby said you wouldn't be ordering.
Jimmie forgot to tell me Mrs Newby.
Help yourself.
And have a scone.
Did you know I was getting married in the new year?
Congratulations, Miss Graf.
Do I know him?
No I don't think so.
Mr Stead from Wallabadah, that's his property
NNNNNN
Are you still teaching miss?
No, I've more than enough to do.
Which leads me to what
I wanted to say.
I'm sure that we...
...my future husband and I.
Could employ you at Wallabadah.
It's your chance. You'll only lose that child of yours if you stay with the blacks.
You'd have your own room Mrs Blacksmith.
And be able to have the baby with you all the time.
Grievous, miss!
You must leave them natives.
I beg you that you see the sense of my offer.
But...
...I'm married to Jimmy.
Christian married.
That bloody all white bitch.
Who does she think she is?
What right has she got?
Advance any groceries, bloody
Newby owes me!
They're all the bloody same, buggerers.
So smug.
She thinks she's so superior, Jimmie.
What do they keep doing this?
What did I have do wrong?
Scraf!
Bloody bitch!
Possuming Mister Blacksmith?
Can I see Mr Newby Mrs? I wanna talk to him about the groceries.
Mr Newby is at the old farmhouse.
He and the boys are bagging wheat.
They'll be outdoor all night.
What about my groceries, we need them!
Look my husband is not a charitable institution, Mr Blacksmith.
Charitable? I earned it Mrs.
You know what he wants, get rid of those... hangers-on and he'd be only too pleased to...
He owes me Mrs for 900 yards.
I'm sure you'll forgive me for believing me own husband.
What are you doing here?
You know I haven't got anything to eat, boss.
You know that!
I can't go on forwarding your supplies.
Forwarding? I earn everything you gave me and more.
Look, you're not working as good as you did before them others come.
You're giving signs of giving up the job.
I'll have the expense and the inconvenience of finding someone else
You owe me Mr Newby, for 900 yards.
Listen Jimmie,
Don't you come the bush-lawyer with me.
I've got a hungry wife and a kid at home.
She knows where they can come if she wants steady tucker.
Mrs Graf's made a generous offer.
It ain't up to that fucking schoolteacher to make any offer.
You black bastard don't you talk to me like that.
I'll soon bloody...
Sodding darkie!
Get on! Get straight to bed!
I'll see you tomorrow, and we'll talk about what's to be done.
Yeah...we'll talk!
One thing...you and your tribe...
...can pack-up and get...
Put this under your coat.
Christ why?
Just in case.
Now listen!
Gonna give these whites a scare.
You go to see the old Mrs.
What is it now?
Good evening Mrs.
We saw Mr Newby, he said we could have some flour.
- He gave you a note?
- He was too busy Mrs.
Do you expect me to go traipsing off over there to find out if you were lying or not?
- Tell him to go away mom.
- Get your gun.
Tabidgi!
Mr Blacksmith.
Please, Jimmie!
Jimmie!
Mom!
No!
Here!
Jimmie!
Mort, for Christ sake!
Here! Gilda!
Hurry!
- What's that Jimmie!
- We had a battle, quick!
Get the bag and get your stuff.
Hurry!
- You're alright?
- Yeah I'm alright.
Something with Mr Newby went bad.
I'll tell you about later.
What's wrong with him?
You alright?
Ready Mort?
Yeah Jimmie!
Come on we got to NNN.
Gilda? Alright?
Tabidgi, we gotta leave'em bad spirits.
Come on, we gotta make distance.
They'll cover our tracks.
Jimmie... I can't go on much longer, Jimmie.
Christ! You don't think I'll do him any harm.
Pardon me Jimmie, don't know what you've done already.
I declared war...
...that's what I've done.
Declared war.
- Mr Sims, Mrs Sims.
- Hi you.
I'm sorry.
- Brutal thing that happened.
- Our heat is with your mama.
Terribly sorry, Jack.
Tragedy.
It's amazing he's still alive
I can't believe it.
Formol.
It's better this way, honnest.
And get picked up soon by farmers or something.
Tell the police I said I declared war.
Tell how bloody measly Newby was.
Tell them all the damage done at Newby's
I done, not Tabidgi.
And I declared war, right?
Jimmie?
Make his bloody father give him a help in life.
Jimmie, dearest...
Easy to follow, boss... they're heading that way.
- NNNN print isn't it?
- Yes Boss.
That's very far, let's go.
Come on, Mort.
They'll be alright.
Come on, they got plenty to eat!
Christ sake Mort, come on!
We gotta leave them!
After all Dad did for them.
A beautiful girl your intended.
Beautiful girl.
And Timmy saw what happened.
He heard them call to each other.
Her face wasn't hurt at all... your intended's.
Little child was in a cot.
He had a piece of fruit cake.
That must have...
Mr Newby, Mr Newby!
Mrs Newby is...
Oh, God!
Bastards! Black bastards!
She was about to be married, she's a fine girl, not common.
Can you see in a girl like that?
The pain.
How could he do this thing?
Everything we did for him was just a waste of time.
Poor Jimmie.
What you mean poor Jimmie?
These are violent times, wars...
What's that got to do with Jimmie?
We got to face it.
He's what he was born nothing more than a black savage!
He's half white.
Anyhow, the Mail'll have all the photographs.
Surely not all Mr Knowler. There are some things the public ought to be spared.
How d'you mean?
Murder is not just a matter of being made to lie down on the floor.
Even virgins and wives can die in ways that make the toughest policeman sick.
Photographs far taken too terrible for anyone other than doctors and senior policeman to look at.
I wouldn't like to see nothing like that.
What I mean is that I might recognize the farm or some of the people.
I'm a Gilgandra boy myself
I might know these Newby people.
Oh, yes.
What strikes me is this:
The other morning, there's news of a really bad murder.
He's just in the same position I am.
He don't know the killers and he don't know these poor women who got killed.
Jimmie Blacksmith is a name you never heard of.
But now, his name is known throughout the state.
The whole country is in arms looking for him.
And you know, you gonna meet him on the gallows.
For the final act, in a killing that'll be remembered forever.
You got a ringside seat to history.
A florin please.
I mean, it must be an interesting thing t'know that all the famous murderers when they get caught, have got t'face you in the end.
I don't face them, I don't say a word to them, I'm just part of the apparatus.
Come on Mort, you stupid fool.
Mullett you mad bastard!
It's me Mort Blacksmith!
Me and my brother Jimmie, we're in trouble with the police.
I haven't much got food in it you know.
We brung all our food, we'll only sleep next to your fire.
We've been going all day, our bloody blankets are wet.
Come on in out of the wet, you too come on.
Let's eat!
I'm buggered.
Good training for you in case you join war.
God knows where they are.
- Bastards can travel.
- Never find them in bush like this.
Yeah it's real black fellow country.
They make us running round in circles.
You think we'll join the war?
I might...now.
- Britain's war not ours.
- They're worst than this.
Look at all the fellows dying of disease.
Hardly anyone ever get shot.
Bloody Boers don't need guns.
Look the death list in the Herald:
Private Briggs enteric fever,
Brown enteric fever, enteric fever, hardly anyone ever dies of wounds.
- Boers've got no sympathy too.
- Why not?
All they wanted to do is have their land and keep the black man in his place.
Stick us, will you?
NNNNNNNN
Run away Mort for sweet Jesus'sake.
You only come here to get justice.
I don't want your help, bugger off, please.
There's a woman here, put magic on your butt, get away!
There ain't no cure for that sort of bitch!
Get away Mort!
Jesus!
Sorry! It's just twenty gauge.
Want a drink of water?
Your fucking husband wouldn't even give me a ride into Merriwa.
And what did you care?
Father's little joy.
Does Healy deserve all this?
He starved me and told me bloody lies.
But it's woman blood, and it's child blood.
Don't worry yourself about that blood bullshit.
Jesus Christ... will you look at what you've done?
I know what I've done.
Healy deserves to see his kid.
And so does Gilda...
And all the frigging others...
Let's get away Jimmie.
Let's get away to Queensland.
What's the matter Mrs Graf?
You see, give him a good look at what he caused.
Mort!
For Christ sake!
Watch out!
You stupid bastard...
I wanted him to see what he bloody caused.
Why?
It has to be done.
Can you imagine me asking everyone who done me wrong?
Like a gentleman, for me too, they'll bloody laugh.
But no more women.
I promise Mort.
No more, Mort.
You know, I can feel the bastards waiting,
Right from the first.
They expected of it.
They wanted to do wrong.
To bugger up.
They're bloody disappointed if you don't.
Jesus...what for?
Kind of heard him if we're good.
But no more women, I promise.
At least you fought the Newby boys fair.
It weren't the Newby boys.
Weren't all Newby.
Christ what are you telling me?
- What I'm saying is...
- What are you saying?
It was bloody old Mrs Newby and the girls and their fucking schoolie.
- You're a fucking devil man.
- I'm your brother.
I got bloody mad.
You're a fucking devil-man!
And your brother!
You shot a bloody women yourself!
That was accidental.
Get away from me devil-man!
- Mort!
- You're a fucking devil-man.
Mort, I'm your brother!
Alright! You can go to hell!
These two fellers... pretty bloody tough, cut your water off or bloody throat like as not.
You get off in the bush, and catch a possum to your house, alright?
You go quiet.
If you go near constable Harrogate, they'll shoot the two of you, and him as well.
Go on!
Who's this Harrogate?
It's alright, its alright.
All blacks camps get constable.
Protect me against angry white fellers.
Because there are lots of angry whites riding up and down the countryside with rifles.
It's alright.
Come.
It's alright, it's alright.
You know what we did?
Yeah, you ripped up some people didn't you?
And you ain't gonna reap me up, are you Mort?
Fendy, Mary!
Come on get out of here, come on!
NNNNNNNNNNNN
Don't leave your food, don't leave your bloody blankets,
Come on Mort, don't be a bastard.
It'll make me look silly!
You can't bloody fly with a mountain in your beak.
I been fair. You can't. I'm sorry!
Fuck! Come on, Mort!
Is that you dude?
Jesus!
C'mon, let's go!
Jesus and Mary, don't do that,
I might live.
Comes from around here, you go around the other side
Oh Jesus! Poor Irish idiot.
Black bastards!
Has the Jury reached the verdict as to the charge of the murders of Miss Jane Newby and Miss Vera Newby?
We have your honor.
What is that verdict?
We find the defendant guilty, your honor.
Has the jury reached the verdict as to the charge of accessory to the murders of Mrs Heather
Newby and Miss Petra Graf?
We have your honor.
What is that verdict?
We find the defendant guilty, your honor.
Very well.
Have you anything to say before I pass sentence?
I only wanted to give Jimmie sacred stone.
Let him know he shouldn't have married a white girl
I've never done nothing like this before.
You would think it takes quite a while to make up your mind to kill someone.
And then to kill him.
I'm just an ignorant black man, but take my word for it, it only takes a second.
I wonder if they've gone down to the coast?
Round place like Port Macquarie,
Taree.
Taree?
I know a family in Taree.
Two nice daughters.
You can't live like a monk for the rest of your life.
Well the blacksmiths aren't going to live like monks.
As poor bloody Toban found out.
Poor bloody Toban.
They'right you know Dowie.
They're clever bastards.
We made and done enough.
No one will blame you if you stop now.
Someone will get on them. A bunch of farmers will come across them by accident.
It's the only way they'll meet by bloody accident.
Come of it, Dowie. We both know you didn't want to marry that Graf girl.
- Shut up, Dud.
- I've stuck with you...
- Don't make a song and dance about it.
At least I'll able to speak my mind.
I'm just as pissed off as you are.
I'm just as pissed off as you are.
Right! Say what you bloody think!
Right! You bloody know you'd jest as soon not git yoked with that high-hat schoolie.
Come on you two...Bye bye.
- Hi darling.
- Hi darling.
Good day?
- How's Baba?
- She's sleeping.
I know who you two are,
God you've traveled fast!
Sorry darling, we just spotted a rabbit. You go inside I'll be in in a moment.
C'mon Jimmie.
- C'mon!
- No!
If you two gentlemen are in any doubt as to whether to kill us, just let me tell you, my wife's sick and I don't have much insurance.
And we're both bloody innocent!
You got any flour? Bacon?
Oh yes, enough of that.
You don't have to think you must kill us.
You let a couple live up in the Barrington Tops.
As soon as we turned our backs you'd be off to the bloody police.
It was a schoolie who did for Ned Kelly.
You're welcome to take my horse, I'm at least
22 miles from the nearest police station.
A walk like that would take me two days.
Look...
I know I can reason with you.
Because you aren't mad either of you.
Let me show you something
I know you'd enjoy.
It's in the Bulletin.
By the way, I know you're not gonna believe me if I say I got no arms in the house.
In fact I have a bonzer Martini Henry carbine.
I got no ammunition for it.
My father-in-law gave it to me. Was a wedding present, everyone said it was a funny present.
Someone said it was to keep the cow-cockies away from my wife.
Shut up, just show us what you gonna show us.
Where's that copy of the Bulletin dear?
There...
What's it say?
At the bottom it says:
Blacksmith brothers, still alive after two months.
We say to the police dogs:
"Go back to your boss and tell him you ain't see nothing.".
Hostage.
I couldn't keep up with you two.
I'd only hold you back.
I got respiratory troubles.
- We wouldn't hurt him Misses.
- Get yourself some blankets and a ground sheet.
- I'm short of breath.
- It's a dangerous time of the year for him.
If I sweat I catch cold!
- He's got chest inflammation.
- Go get the things!
Double blankets.
You have to keep warm...
...not too warm.
- What about your Heritance?
- Still hard trekking in Wellingtons.
Socks!
- Have you seen my Palgrave?
- No!
Socks...vest.
I'll have to care of all.
- Where the hell is it?
- I get it.
No fire!
They're looking for fires.
Who'll be fucking looking?
The schoolie needs a cup.
Don't be such a bloody old lubra.
He's here for us, we're not here for him.
He's here for us, we're not here for him.
Well I want one too.
Fucking old women's church turn out.
I can understand you being angry.
I can imagine it Jimmie.
I mean, settlers still spoke about marauding blacks. 10 years ago.
Marauding blacks! Bullshit.
How many whites really ever got killed by Aborigenes?
No one knows.
But it wasn't more than four or five thousand.
Not enough.
Well, you might ask how many
Aborigenes did the whites killed?
The answer is a quarter of a million.
- Not more than that?
- Lot more.
I understand you being angry.
A whole country...that they took away away of life.
What for?
What harm have we done?
It comes as if we haven't given you anything.
We've introduced you to alcohol, religion.
Religion!
Influenza.
Measles.
Syphilis.
School.
A whole hearst of improvements.
No school tomorrow.
It strikes me, they must have killed the teacher.
Otherwise he would have slowed them down.
I mean there's about 20000 people searching for them and we haven't seen; for three weeks.
I'm sure they'll soon be brought to Justice
Mr Knowler. The army's involved.
After everything they have done,
I expect these are hanging to looking forward too.
I just do what is expected of me Mr Knowler.
No more, no less.
Of course I can understand you being concerned.
I don't follow you Mr Knowler.
Well, I'm told the blacks present problems.
How d'you mean.
Scientific problems you might say, problems with hanging you know.
I didn't know.
I'd better ask such questions to you
Mr Knowler since you're the expert.
Well, that last black they hanged, in Ba
I don't like to say it, but the newspapers do.
Said what?
That he never got his head pulled off.
What newspapers said that?
Truth. A sporting chronicle.
What's a sporting paper doing for stuff like that?
When I went to work for farmers, for farmers like Newby, they were all us afraid I'd turn their property to a blacks camp.
They always said a filthy blacks camp.
It looks as if you aren't keeping yourself very clean Mr Schoolteacher.
I don't want my place turned into a filthy whites camp.
Stupid bastard, Jimmie!
I tell you, if I get one of my chest inflammations...
Go and fill up the can, it'll keep you warm.
Why don't you go and fill it yourself, you stupid bastard that spilt it.
What do he think I am?
A bloody schoolie servant?
You'd like me to go, so you can tell him how you've never cut up any women and you're a nice abo off a mission.
- Well I never cut up any woman!
- Just shot one in the chest, but that don't count.
Christ! They should've sent you fight the bloody Boers!
Be quiet! If you stand there comparing evils, you won't end until you've put a bullett through each other's heart.
You oughtta know that no one doesn't murder unless he wants to.
You can hurt people by accident.
But you harmed the people you harmed.
Because you chose to go to them, ready to harm them and with the arms to do it.
I'll get the water.
- We must test ourselves against spirits.
- Fuck, stupid boong!
Initiation ground. The whole of the Manning River tribe used to use it.
Now we're cursed.
There's a shape like a womb, and small stones inside.
Holly stones, sacred stones.
Why do we want to go buggering round a place like that?
It's a sacred ground.
And there's no one to use it now.
They got all the poor blacks herded together down at Purfleet.
Alright, alright!
How far to this bloody place?
A mile, straight up the scarp.
Alright. If you both got that much wind...
This is dreadful!
It's too bloody dreadful!
We must build it up again.
God will forgive us if we buid it up again.
You're bloody mad, you'll never fix it.
It'll take bloody days and you still wouldn't fix it!
It's no use, it's buggered.
It's no use, it's buggered.
There's no hope for!
You must leave Mort Jimmie... you can see that.
Mort's been on all I done.
He wounded a woman... but she's getting better.
He shot a man!
I need Mort and Mort needs me!
Would you say so Jimmie?
You ought to bugger off.
Give him a chance.
You ought to leave us.
Why in hell?
The boy isn't really your brother.
He's an Aborigene.
Not like you.
There's too much Christian in you.
It'll only bugger him up.
Like its buggered you.
I'll ask him.
Don't ask him.
He'll only stay with you because of loyalty.
You just got to bugger off at night.
I'm taking it for granted that you love Mort.
Listen Mr, you'd better wrap yourself up in the blanket and just shut up.
Jimmie!
What was that?
Jesus!
I've got McCreadie schoolteacher from Tambourine...
They're three of us here, we've all got rifles you'd better put McCready down and bugger off.
Watch out, you might hit McCready!
Clear off and leave him there!
Bastard! You shot beautiful!
Got what he deserved.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Mr Stead, you can join us for the next one.
Constable will you mind stand beside, please.
- It's the other bastard I want.
- We'll get him next time.
I reckon this is NNNN as we gonna get.
Oh, don't bloody start that again for Christ sake!
Take your position, please.
Thank you, hold it!
Thank you for joining me, Grand Master Hyberry.
My pleasure, Minister.
I know you're a busy man but
I have some rather good news for you.
Confidentially of course.
The premier has put you down on a preparatory list of nominations for Royal Honours.
Royal honours?
Which it?
An MBE.
It's good that they shot that target they gotta hang.
That all goes well for you, for we haven't yet killed that NNN duos.
I don't understand sir.
Otherwise you'd have to wait.
They got shot good-oh everything above board.
If you have to hang him over the public interest in the case, it'll look like you'll be rewarded for stringing him up, and in some quarters they'll even thought of as heroes.
Minister says it's gonna be bad enough choosing a time to hang Mr Blacksmith and his uncle.
Everyone will be in such a... high state of mind with all this, federation nonsense.
Hanging and all the things that go with it is a bit out of place.
Everything in good time...
...even Justice.
Never mind in a year or so...
Tell me, what would you have done if the Blacksmith had been sentenced?
I got him! Beautiful!
- Oh it's very cold.
- Yes, sister.
Jesus!
He's a lot better than when I brought him in.
Didn't think he'll live.
There's no shit in Sydney since he won't have to travel.
Watch him bloody so he can't leave.
Mrs Neville and I...
...I feel very responsible.
We both, feel extremely sorry for you, Jimmie.
We don't feel it's some tal-ly-ho.
It's time...
Offering to me, the giving and the end, first and last, blessed are they, that do his commandements...
I don't foressee any difficulty.
Everything appears to be normal.
Although his neck muscles simply more developped than the average black.
For without, are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers, and murderers, idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.
There should be no problems.
Where you been, lad?
Bus goes in 15 minutes.
The farm. I had to get this back.
I'll want something to read.
Anyway, I'm, uh...
I'm all ready upstairs.
Your mother's up there.
What's the book?
- Oh, David Copperfield.
- You'll be lucky if you have time for reading.
I never did.
- Has he got everything?
- Of course, he doesn't need much.
- What do you mean, he doesn't need much?
- Well, they give him the rest... clothes, rations, you know.
He needs what I've given him.
Time for the bus, lad. You don't want to miss that train.
- Bye, Mum.
- Good luck, Son.
Let's go.
Move away from it, son.
Get back. Get back.
- Bring it out! Bring it out!
- Over against the wall.
There's somebody up there.
- Here we go.
- Get these hoses back! Get back! Get back!
All right, look out!
It's going! It's going!
Sorry, lad. You just missed it.
Go and get some sleep.
I'll finish here.
Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren... that this child is born again... and received into the family of Christ's church... let us give thanks unto Almighty
God for these benefits... and, with one accord, make our prayers unto him... that this child may lead the rest of his life according to this beginning.
Are you for the camp?
Hey, you!
- Are you for the camp?
- Yeah.
You're a bit late, son.
The others got in last night.
I know.
Got caught up in that air raid, eh?
- Yes.
- Oh, well, never mind, son.
You'll have to walk.
It's not many miles.
Put the case down.
- Name?
- Thomas Beddows.
Sir.
- Thomas Beddows, sir.
- You're late.
And... halt!
And... halt!
Who are you?
- Thomas Beddows, sir.
- Do I look like an officer?
- Forward, march!
- No, sir.
Don't call me "sir" then.
Who gave you permission to fall in?
- To what?
- To enter.
To come in the room. To open the door and make an entrance.
- No one.
- Get it right then.
Go back outside, knock.
And when I say "yes," come in and say, "Permission to fall in."
Go on.
Beddows.
Your case... take it.
Yes?
- Who are you?
- Beddows. Permission to fall in.
Come in, Private Beddows.
You can have that one.
Leave that.
You're late already.
Haircut's next.
You'll find the barbershop next to the company office.
- Next!
- Stand still. Stand still.
Stand still. Next.
Next. Name?
- Beddows, sir.
- Skinny, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
- Got a cough?
- No, sir.
- Okay. Clothes on over there.
- Next.
- Are you gonna stick that in me?
- Arm, please.
Feeling better, are you?
I don't like needles.
Is that all? I don't like the whole sodding army.
All recruits, form up by the door.
Into line. Get a move on!
Right! Abrahams, Arlott, Beddows!
Malcolm, Partridge, Silver, Young.
Right. Let's have a look at you.
Can you tell me what you've got there?
One pair of shorts, P.T.
One pair of drawers, cellular.
One balaclava. One pair of braces. One pair of boots.
Great coat, socks, vests, gaiters.
Webbing, packs large and small.
Battle dress, gas mask.
Mess tins, mug, knife, fork and spoon.
Anything else?
I don't think so.
What's this?
It's a pull-through.
You're learning.
Okay, all of you!
You're gonna keep this lot so clean it dazzles me, and you're gonna start now!
Let's get two things straight right away!
The first thing: The word of command, "Stand easy."
You will not move at all... until that word of command is given to you!
You will not fidget, move about or anything else!
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Corporal!
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Corporal!
Up! Wash! Shave! Get dressed!
Clean this barracks room, and I want it shining!
- One!
- Two!
- Three!
- Four!
- Five!
- Six!
- Seven!
- Eight!
- Nine!
- Ten!
- Eleven!
- Twelve!
The odd numbers, one pace forward!
Even numbers, one pace to the rear!
- March!
- One, two!
- Young, how many V.C.'s in the regiment?
- Four V.C.'s.
- Beddows, name of the regimental sergeant major.
- Regimental Sergeant Major Palmer.
- Right! Any questions?
- The regiment formed in 1685.
- Yes.
- What for?
I mean, was there any special reason?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
To impress the French!
Right. Let's have a look at what you been doing. Stand by your beds!
Right! Now, let's start all over again, shall we?
- Count!
- One, two, three! One!
Still! Perfectly still!
Form three ranks! Quick.
March! Center. Rear.
Front. Center. Rear.
Front. Center. Rear.
Front. Center. Rear.
Front. Center. Rear.
Front. Rear. And fill over.
Right!
- Turn!
- One, two...
Get a hold of it now! Come along!
At arm level, by your right!
Look to your right!
Get your arm up.
Eyes... front!
- Beddows, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
What haven't you done, Beddows?
I seem to have neglected to blanco the belt underneath the buckle, sir.
- See to it next time.
- Yes, sir.
By the right! Quick march!
Left, right! Left, right! Now!
Squad!
- Halt!
- Left, one, two!
What are you bloody doing, Beddows?
Move back hard now!
Twist it! Twist it!
Spill his guts!
Come on! Come on! Keep your heads up!
- For fuck's sake, get between...
- Whoa!
Don't look down. Don't look down!
Bloody fool!
Come on! Come on!
Afraid to get your feet wet?
Keep those rifles dry!
Get up that bloody ladder!
Come on! What do you think this is, a picnic?
Come on! Get up, you silly sod!
Come on! You haven't finished yet!
Fuck. I need a fag.
They're ahead.
Well, you go on.
I'm stopping for a smoke.
- I hate this war.
- You'll get through.
No, it's not that.
It's me girl.
We was engaged, see, and... and then when orders come along, well... her old man wouldn't let me marry her.
Sod him.
Said we could wait till after we won the war.
Bastard.
He'd let the Jerries poke his wife if they as much as knocked on the door.
I wanted to fly.
Failed the medical.
Didn't know that.
- Who you got waiting for you, Tommy?
- Who have I got?
Well, there's Mum and Dad, I suppose.
And Tina.
Good for you, mate.
Let me guess.
She got brown hair, brown eyes... pale skin, nice tits, right?
Tina is a cocker spaniel.
- She's a lovely dog.
- A bitch?
Yeah. A bitch.
What are you gonna do when all this is over?
Oh, I don't know.
I've got me plans.
Garage, mate.
I'm gonna buy a garage somewhere and set up a scrap metal business on the side.
- How 'bout coming in with me, Tom?
- Hey. We ought to go.
Coming with me and the lads tomorrow?
We're celebrating... end of training.
Pub crawl in the afternoon, fleapit in the evening.
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
What's the film?
Forget the picture, mate.
It's the women.
You get next to a nice piece in the back stalls, you'll be away before the titles come up.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
- They got at least 10 minutes on us.
- You think so?
No bleeding NAAFI for us tonight.
- I'm going down.
- What, down there?
Yeah.
Hey! Don't do it.
You'll kill yourself.
- Has he seen the M.O.?
- M.O. said he didn't need treatment, sir.
Prisoner and escort... about... turn!
Prisoner and escort, quick march!
Left, right! Left, right!
Prisoner and escort, halt!
Private Beddows, fall in!
At 0900 hours, you will parade at the main gate... where you'll get the transport to take you to your units.
You'll be back here by 2100 hours... or your mother won't recognize you by the time I'm finished with you.
Forget what I've told you, and you won't be around...
- Comfy, was it?
- to write me a thank-you letter after the war's over.
Making a signal, Beddows?
Only for "victory," Corporal.
This is Movietone.
Get down there! Get down!
- Hello, Jack.
- All by ourselves, are we?
You're a solitary sort of geezer, aren't you?
I felt like reading.
Christ, I wish this fucking war was over.
You spill your blood and guts to help the Belgians... and then four years later, you get ready to spill 'em again to help the fucking French.
And in between, you go paddling down on the south coast learning how to keep your bloody rifle dry.
It's a fucking mix-up, if you ask me.
I've been in His Majesty's bleeding forces four and a half years... seen active service, and now they want to send me back to bleeding battle school.
- You know what that means, don't you?
- No.
It means we'll be the first ashore when they do put on the sodding invasion, that's what.
Mmm.
- I suppose someone's got to go first.
- It's no fucking joke!
You will now be taken to the coast... where you will be joined by Allied Forces... and take part in combined exercises and assault training.
- Hi!
- We want to see you again, baby.
- Oh-ho! And you, soldier.
- Blow us a kiss, sweetheart.
- Good luck. Have a good time. Bye.
- I love your hat.
- How you doing? Let's have a quickie.
- Cheeky!
- Come on, sweetheart.
- Bye!
Disembark as quickly as possible.
Move up the beach and join your company.
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Keep them moving, Sergeant!
Hold on to the rope!
Hold those rifles high and keep moving.
Move up the beach behind the flail tank.
Rise up, "C" Company!
You will remain in these positions... until you are instructed to hold tight to ram the beach.
- This is a bloody nightmare.
- I feel sick.
Watch out. We're going in.
Stand by to hit the beach.
Ah! Aha.
Right then, Tom. This is it.
Lots of lovely crumpet just waiting for it.
- Are you ready?
- Have you got any cigarettes?
Freeman's again. Here. Take 'em.
- Right. Fit?
- I'll follow you.
Okay.
Good evening. Early tonight, lads?
- Got any wine, have you?
- Wine?
- Two pints of brown ale then, please.
- Vintage?
Look around, my boy.
What do you see?
- Half the regiment.
- Yeah.
Ta.
How long you lads gonna be around here?
Oh, we're not gonna be around much longer.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- You haven't got a drink.
- No.
- Can I... Can I get you one?
- No, thank you.
- Have you been here long?
- What, sitting in this chair, you mean?
No. Here, generally.
About as long as most people, I suppose.
Oh.
- And you?
- What?
How long have you been here?
Just arrived really.
But, um, I don't think I'll stay long.
- It's a bit dull, don't you think?
- What's dull?
- Dances, all this.
- I don't think dancing's dull.
- Oh?
- No.
Well, then let's...
Uh, will you have a dance with me, please?
- I don't mind if I do.
- Come on then.
- How you doing, Arthur?
- All right.
- Watch out.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not very good on my feet.
- Shall we stop then?
No. Let's go on, please.
Was that any better?
You're not as bad as all that.
Shall we go outside for a bit?
What for?
The rain's stopped.
All right.
- Is this your coat?
- Yes.
Have you seen any action?
Not really.
What do you mean, "Not really"?
Well, I've been on training.
That was tough.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Do you like it?
- What?
Being a soldier.
Not much, no.
Then why are you?
- A soldier?
- Mmm.
I was called up, like everyone else.
- Is that all?
- No.
It's gotta be done.
We gotta finish it off and pay out the ones who started it.
Yes.
I think you're very nice.
Do you?
Yes, I do.
I like you too.
I feel much better now.
I was quite... nervous when I first talked to you.
- It's funny.
- I know.
You thought the dance was awfully dull.
I didn't, really.
- No?
- No.
Can I kiss you?
If you want.
I've got to go now. I'm with my brother. He's in the band.
Well, when can I see you again?
Whenever you'd like.
Not tomorrow.
- Monday?
- Yes. I'd like that.
Here, at 6:00.
All right.
Will you walk me back to the hall?
Anywhere you'd like.
Back to the hall.
I wish I'd met you before.
There's so little time now.
What do you say that for?
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.
You'll be back... and there'll be time.
Where are we going?
I've lost all sense of direction.
A game of musical bloody chairs, mate.
Thousands of us moving around from camp to camp... waiting for someone to shout, "Second front! Last one over's a Charlie!"
First one over's a
Charlie, if you ask me.
You'd think they'd have a bit of sympathy for us by now, wouldn't you? Send us by train.
A G.I. told me where to find sympathy.
It's in the dictionary between
"shit" and "syphilis."

Come on! Wake up!
Come on! Come on! Wake up, everybody!
Wake up! Look lively!
Come on! Move!
Fall in opposite the barbed wire!
You won't be doing any work. If you're wise, you'll take advantage of it.
Sorry about the tight security.
It means no wireless sets, newspapers or telephoning... and I'm afraid none of your letters will get posted until afterwards.
I'm sure all of you realize the importance of what lies ahead.
That's all for now.
All right, Sergeant-Major.
I thought you were meeting me tonight.
- I was called away.
- Why?
To fight the war.
- Couldn't you have told me?
- There was no time.
So you left me.
- There was no choice.
- Are you coming back?
Don't know.
Am I going to wait for you?
I don't know.
I do though.
Good-bye, Tom.
Please... don't go.
Fill in the form, please.
Name and address of next of kin.
If I get killed, they've already got a photograph.
It's for our records,
Private Beddows.
Oh.
Follow the sign outside, please, and get your anti-louse ware from the stores... if you haven't already.
God. How much more?
There's a will form...
B-2089... to fill in.
- What for?
- What do you think?
Cannon fodder.
That's what we are.
Die of boredom, die in battle.
What's the difference?
Did you hear what Tom did this morning?
No.
He went to see old Nickelby... and asked him if they gave out compassionate leave if there'd been a death in the family.
So Nickelby said, "Oh, yeah, yeah, depending on the circumstances."
And Tom said, "Well, there hasn't been a death in my family yet...
"but there's gonna be one very soon.
I request leave to go home and console my parents."
What did Nickelby do?
He sent Tom with a note to the M.O.
Oh, Tommy. He's nuts.
No, no. No, Tommy's not nuts.
He could do with a break.
Well, we could all do with a break.
It's been nothing but film shows, housey-housey... and lemonade in the bleedin'
NAAFI when the beer runs out.
- Ah.
- Ah!
They're for me.
Shit.
Don't tell me it's your birthday.
Yeah. Couple of days ago.
The mail was held up.
What's that?
- It's a key.
- That's a funny sort of birthday present.
- What's it for?
- What? It's a custom in our family.
You know, key to the door, coming of age, that sort of thing.
- You just 21?
- Yeah.
Happy birthday, kid.
- Plenty more of 'em.
- Thanks.
How about this, Jack?
Oh, that's nice.
I think I'll go and get some ink and write back to them.
- Can I have a look at your cards?
- Yeah, help yourself. See you later.
Army post office, England.
Dearest Mum and Dad.
Thank you very much for your letter and the presents, which have just arrived.
My fountain pen works very well, as you can see.
We're very cut-off here, as you can see from the address.
I don't know where we are, exactly.
It was so nice to hear from you.
You don't have to worry about me.
We are eating very well in this camp.
Although the beds are hard,
I'm getting plenty of sleep.
We all think the invasion can't be far off.
It's like being part of a machine which gets bigger and bigger... while we grow smaller and smaller until there's nothing left.
I wish I had some news.
Yesterday I saw a fox on the other side of the barbed wire.
And when we could still go out I went to see
This Happy Breed with Celia Johnson in it.
I thought it was terrific at the time... but I can't remember much about it now.
Seems so distant.
Everything outside the army and my mates here has faded away.
I must have done even more traveling in the last two weeks... than when I went to France on that school holiday.
But I couldn't tell you where we are or where we've come from.
All we do is sit in trucks and barracks, waiting for our bit of the war to start.
At any other time... your news about Tina would have left me unable to think of anything else.
But now it just seems part of the war... like everything else.
I was going to ask you to keep one of the puppies... but I don't think there's much point.
I don't think I shall live to see the end of this war.
It sounds silly... but this war has killed so many people already.
I'm just going to be another one.
Of that I'm sure.
I can feel it... the way you feel it when you're going to get a cold.
I didn't know whether to tell you.
I thought you shouldn't get one of those official letters... without knowing what was inside.
Please be brave.
I shall be all right.
I'm not frightened.
It is necessary to burn all personal letters and papers... or wrap them in the paper being issued to be sent home.
The choice is yours.
You will carry nothing except your pay book, part one, and Bible.
I've got nothing now.
I've thrown it all away.
I don't think I'm gonna get through this.
You'll be all right.
We'll get you through.
- I'm not walking through this lot.
- So much for the seaside.
♪ And I don't care for him ♪
♪ He can go and get another ♪
♪ That I hope he will enjoy ♪
♪ For I'm going to marry ♪
♪ A far nicer boy ♪
- Sing it again, Susannah.
- Please, Mommy.
Sing it right through once more, for the soldiers.
♪ So let him go ♪
♪ Let him tarry ♪
♪ Let him sink or let him swim ♪
♪ He doesn't care for me ♪
♪ And I don't care for him ♪
♪ He can go and get another ♪
♪ That I hope he will enjoy ♪
- ♪ For I'm... ♪
- Don't go, tommies.
Tommies, please don't go.
I think I'm gonna be sick again.
- Why didn't you become an officer, Jack?
- I failed the initiative test.
They locked me in a broken-down potting shed... and told me to imagine I was a prisoner trying to escape.
If I used that wall, I'd be shot. If I climbed that fence, I'd be electrocuted.
If I trod here, there, anywhere,
I'd be blown up by hidden mines.
I didn't move a fucking inch.
If they hadn't come and let me out,
I'd still have been in that shed... waitin' to become an officer.
This is it.
We're going in.
Well, Beddows, how many
V.C.'s in the regiment?
Five V.C.'s. Name of the commanding officer?
Lieutenant Colonel Hutchinson.
When was the regiment formed?
- Jesus Christ.
Names of all the birds Arthur's had since he joined the army.
- Belinda.
- Yeah.
- Mabel.
- Yup.
- Alice?
- Ah, she were mine first.
- Janey.
- Who's that?
Shall I show you how we prepare the dead?
Now bring me back.
Oh, Christ! He's hit! Tommy!
- Get him down!
- Get out of the bloody way!
Hold tight to ram the beachhead!
- Get out of the blasted way!
- Get out of the way, man!
Get down!
Jack, hold him! Hold him!
Hold him! Hold him!
Lay him down. It's all right.
I've got him. Lay him down.
- Easy. You'll be all right.
- Oh, God, he's dead.
Oh, fuck.
Fair is foul and foul is fair.
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning or in rain?
When the hurlyburly's done.
When the battle's lost and won.
- That would be ere the set of sun.
- Where?
Upon the heath.
There to meet with Macbeth.
- What bloody man is that?
- Hail, friend!
Say to the king thy knowledge of the broil as thou left it.
The merciless Macdonwald led his rebellion from the Western Isles.
And fortune on his damned quarrel smiled.
- But, brave Macbeth...
- He deserves that name.
- Carved out a passage till he faced the slave.
And ne'er shook hands nor bade farewell...
...till he unseamed him from the nave to the chops.
Valiant cousin!
Upon this chance did the Norwegian king...
...with new supplies of men, begin a fresh assault.
Dismayed not this our captains,
Macbeth and Banquo?
Yes. As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds. They smack of honour.
Go get him surgeons.
- God save the king.
- What news, worthy thane?
Norway, in terrible numbers...
...assisted by this traitor, the Thane of Cawdor...
...began a dismal conflict till
Bellona's bridegroom, Macbeth...
...confronts the king arm against arm, curbing his lavish spirit.
And to conclude, the victory fell on us.
Great happiness! No more that thane shall deceive our bosom interest.
Go pronounce his present death.
And with his former title, greet Macbeth.
So foul and fair a day
I have not seen.
What are these?
So withered and wild in their attire...
...that look not like inhabitants of the Earth.
Speak, if you can.
What are you?
All hail, Macbeth.
Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis.
All hail, Macbeth.
Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor.
All hail, Macbeth, that shall be king hereafter.
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed which outwardly you show?
My partner you greet with grace and great prediction...
...that he seems rapt withal.
To me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time...
...and say which grain will grow and which will not, speak to me...
...who neither beg nor fear your favours nor your hate.
Hail! Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
Not so happy, yet much happier.
Thou shalt beget kings, though thou be none.
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo.
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail.
Stay, you imperfect speakers!
Tell me more.
By Sinel's death,
I know I am Thane of Glamis.
But how of Cawdor?
Say from whence you owe this intelligence.
Or why upon this heath you stop our way with such prophetic greeting?
Whither are they vanished?
Into the air.
And what seemed corporal melted, as breath into the wind.
Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten of the insane root that takes reason prisoner?
Your children shall be kings.
You shall be king.
And Thane of Cawdor. Went it not so?
To the selfsame tune and words.
The Thane of Cawdor lives.
And to be king...
... stands not within
the prospect of belief.
No more than to be Cawdor.
The king hath happily received the news of thy success.
Thick as hail came post with post, and everyone did bear thy praises.
We are sent to give thee from our royal master thanks, not pay thee.
And for an earnest of a greater honour, he bade me call thee...
...Thane of Cawdor.
What?
Can the devil speak true?
He lives. Why do you dress me in borrowed robes?
Who was the thane lives yet, but that life he deserves to lose.
Treasons capital, confessed and proved, have overthrown him.
Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor.
The greatest is behind.
Thanks for your pains.
Do you not hope your children shall be kings?
Those that gave Cawdor to me, promised no less to them.
That, trusted home, might yet enkindle you unto the crown...
...besides the Thane of Cawdor.
Often, to win us to our harm, instruments of darkness tell truths.
Win us with honest trifles, to betray us in deepest consequence.
This supernatural soliciting
cannot be ill...
... cannot be good.
If ill, why hath it given me earnest
of success, commencing in a truth?
I am Thane of Cawdor.
If good, why do I yield
to that suggestion...
... whose horrid image doth unfix
my hair and make my seated heart...
... knock at my ribs
against the use of nature?
Present fears are less
than horrible imaginings.
My thought, whose murder yet
is but fantastical...
... shakes so my single state of man...
... that function is smothered
in surmise...
... and nothing is but what is not.
I thank you, gentlemen.
Look how our partner's rapt.
If chance will have me king,
chance may crown me without my stir.
Worthy Macbeth.
We stay upon your leisure.
Give me your favour, my dull brain was wrought with things forgotten.
Let us to the king.
Long live the king.
Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it.
He threw away the dearest thing he owed as if it were a careless trifle.
There's no art to find a mind's construction in the face.
On him I built an absolute trust.
"Hail, king that shalt be.
This have I thought good to deliver thee...
...my dearest partner of greatness...
...that thou might not be ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell."
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor...
...and shalt be what thou art promised.
Yet I do fear thy nature.
It is too full of the milk of human
kindness to catch the nearest way.
Thou wouldst be great...
... art not without ambition, but
without the illness should attend it.
What thou wouldst highly,
thou wouldst holily.
Wouldst not play false,
yet wouldst wrongly win.
Hie thee hither, that I may pour
my spirits in thine ear.
Hail, Macbeth!
Hail, Thane of Cawdor!
Worthiest cousin! The sin of my ingratitude was heavy on me.
Only I have left to say, more is thy due than more than all can pay.
The service and the loyalty
I owe pays itself.
Your part is to receive our duties.
Welcome. I have begun to plant thee and will labour to make thee grow.
Noble Banquo, that has no less deserved...
...let me enfold thee and hold thee to my heart.
There if I grow, the harvest is your own.
Sons, kinsmen, thanes, and you whose places are the nearest...
...know we will establish our estate...
...upon our eldest, Malcolm.
Whom we name hereafter the Prince of Cumberland.
Hail, Prince of Cumberland!
Hail, Prince of Cumberland!
Go hence to Inverness and bind us further to you.
I'll go and make joyful the hearing of my wife with your approach.
- So humbly take my leave.
- My worthy Cawdor.
It is a peerless kinsman.
The Prince of Cumberland!
That is a step on which I must
fall down, or else o'erleap.
For in my way it lies.
Macbeth! Macbeth!
Stars, hide your fires.
Let not light see my black
and deep desires.
Great Glamis. Worthy Cawdor.
Greater than both by the all-hail hereafter.
Thy letter transported me beyond this present...
...and I feel the future in the instant.
My dearest love...
...Duncan comes here tonight.
- And when goes hence?
- Tomorrow, as he purposes.
Never shall sun that morrow see.
Your face is as a book where men may read strange matters.
He that's coming must be provided for.
You shall put this night's business into my dispatch.
We will speak further.
Look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under it.
Leave all the rest to me.
The raven croaks the fatal entrance
of Duncan under my battlements.
Come, you spirits that tend on
mortal thoughts. Unsex me here.
Fill me from the crown to the toe
top-full of direst cruelty.
Make thick my blood. Stop up
the access and passage to remorse...
... that no compunctious visitings
of nature shake my purpose.
This castle hath a pleasant seat.
The air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses.
Come, thick night, pall thee
in the dunnest smoke of hell...
... that my keen knife
see not the wound it makes...
... nor heaven peep through
the dark to cry, "Hold!"
Fair and noble hostess, we are your guest tonight.
Your servant ever.
Give me your hand.
Conduct me to mine host.
We love him highly and shall continue our graces towards him.
If it were done when 'tis done,
then 'twere well it were done quickly.
If the assassination could
trammel up the consequence...
... and catch,
with his surcease, success.
That but this blow might be
the be-all and the end-all here.
But here, upon this bank
and shoal of time...
... we'd jump the life to come.
Health to this household!
But in these cases,
we still have judgement here...
... that we but teach
bloody instructions...
... which, being taught,
return to plague the inventor.
He's here in double trust.
First, as I am his kinsman
and his subject...
... strong both against the deed.
Then as his host...
...who should against his murderer shut the door, not bear the knife myself.
Besides, this Duncan hath borne his faculties so meek...
... hath been so clear
in his great office...
... that his virtues will plead
like angels, trumpet-tongued...
... against the deep damnation
of his taking-off.
And pity, like a newborn babe striding
the blast, or heaven's cherubin...
... horsed upon the sightless couriers
of the air, shall blow...
... the horrid deed in every eye,
that tears shall drown the wind.
I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent.
But only vaulting ambition...
...which o'erleaps itself and falls on the other side.
- Why have you left the chamber?
- Hath he asked for me?
Know you not he has?
We will proceed no further in this business.
He hath honoured me of late.
And I have bought golden opinions from all sorts of people...
...which would be worn in their newest gloss, not cast aside so soon.
Was the hope drunk, wherein you dressed yourself?
Hath it slept since?
And wakes it now to look so green and pale at what it did so freely?
From this time such I account thy love.
Art thou afeard to be the same in act as in desire?
Prithee, peace.
Wouldst thou live a coward, letting
"I dare not" wait upon "I would"?
Like the poor cat in the adage?
I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares do more is none.
What beast was it then, that made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man.
To be more than what you were, you would be so much more the man.
Hail, Thane of Cawdor.
If we should fail?
We fail.
But screw your courage to the sticking-place and we'll not fail.
Duncan's two chamberlains will I with wine so convince...
...that memory, the warder of the brain, shall be a fume.
I'll drug their possets.
When in swinish sleep their drenched natures lie as in a death...
...what cannot you and I perform upon the unguarded Duncan?
Bring forth men-children only...
... for thy undaunted mettle
should compose nothing but males.
How goes the night?
The moon is down.
I have not heard the clock.
- She goes down at 12.
- I take it 'tis later, sir.
Take my sword.
There's husbandry in heaven.
Their candles are all out.
Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me, and yet I would not sleep.
Merciful powers, restrain the thoughts that nature gives way to in repose.
Who's there?
A friend.
What, sir, not yet at rest?
The king's abed.
He hath been in unusual pleasure...
...and sent great largess to your offices.
Being unprepared, our will became the servant to defect.
All's well.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters.
- To you they have showed some truth.
- I think not of them.
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve...
...we would spend it in words upon that business if you'd grant the time.
At your kindest leisure.
It shall make honour for you.
So I lose none in seeking to augment it. I shall be counselled.
Good repose the while.
Thanks, sir. The like to you.
Is this a dagger
which I see before me...
... the handle toward my hand?
Come...
...let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision...
...sensible to feeling as to sight?
Or art thou but a dagger of the mind...
...a false creation, proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet...
...in form as palpable as this which now I draw.
Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going.
And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools of the other senses...
...or else worth all the rest.
I see thee still!
And on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood...
...which was not so before.
There's no such thing.
It is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes.
Now o'er the one half-world
nature seems dead...
... and withered murder,
alarmed by his sentinel, the wolf...
... whose howl's his watch.
Thus with his stealthy pace,
with Tarquin's ravishing strides...
... towards his design
moves like a ghost.
Thou sure and firm-set earth...
... hear not my steps,
which way they walk...
... for fear the very stones prate
of my whereabouts.
Hear it not, Duncan...
... for it is a knell
that summons thee to heaven...
... or to hell.
I'm afraid they have awaked,
and 'tis not done.
The attempt and not the deed
confounds us.
Hark!
Peace! It was the owl that shrieked...
... the fatal bellman, which gives
the sternest good night.
My husband?
I have done the deed.
Didst thou not hear a noise?
I heard the owl and the crickets.
- Did not you speak? Now.
- As I descended?
- Ay.
- Hark!
- Who lies in the second chamber?
- Donalbain.
This is a sorry sight.
A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
Methought I heard a voice cry,
"Sleep no more.
Macbeth does murder sleep."
The innocent sleep, sleep that knits up the ravelled sleave of care.
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath, balm of hurt minds.
Nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast.
Still it cried to all the house,
"Glamis hath murdered sleep...
...and Cawdor shall sleep no more.
Macbeth shall sleep no more!"
Who was it that thus cried?
These deeds must not be thought after these ways so...
...it will make us mad.
Get some water, and wash this filthy witness from your hands.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there.
I'll go no more.
I am afraid of what I have done.
Look on it again I dare not.
Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers.
If he do bleed...
...l'll gild the faces of the grooms withal...
...for it must seem their guilt.
Whence is that knocking?
How is it with me, when every noise appals me?
What hands are here?
They pluck out mine eyes!
Will great Neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand?
No, this my hand will rather...
...the multitudinous seas incarnadine...
...making the green one red.
My hands are of your colour...
...but I scorn to wear a heart so white.
A little water clears us of this deed.
How easy is it, then!
Retire we to our chamber.
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion show us to be watchers.
Be not lost so poorly in your thoughts.
To know my deed,
'twere best not know myself.
Wake Duncan with thy knocking!
I would thou couldst.
Here's a knocking indeed!
If a man were porter of hell gate, he'd have less turning the key.
Who's there, in the name of Beelzebub?
Knock, knock. Who's there, in the other devil's name?
Knock, knock.
Never at quiet. What are you?
One that goes the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire?
I'll devil-porter it no further.
This place is too cold for hell.
Anon, anon!
Was it so late ere you went to bed, that you lie so late?
We were carousing till the second cock...
...and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.
- What three things?
- Nose-painting, sleep and urine.
Lechery, sir, it provokes and it unprovokes.
It provokes the desire but takes away the performance.
It makes you, it mars you, it sets you on...
...it takes you off, it persuades you, it disheartens you...
...it makes you stand to and not stand to.
- Drink gave thee the lie last night.
- That it did.
- Is thy master stirring?
- Good morrow.
- Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
- Not yet.
He did command me to call timely.
I have almost slipped the hour.
I'll bring you to him.
This is the door.
I'll make so bold to call, for 'tis my appointed service.
- Goes the king hence today?
- He does. He did appoint so.
The night has been unruly.
Our chimneys were blown down.
And, as they say, lamentings heard in the air, strange screams of death.
Some say the earth was feverous.
- 'Twas a rough night.
- Oh, horror!
Horror, horror! Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
Murder hath broke open the Lord's anointed temple.
- What is it you say?
- Mean you His Majesty?
Do not bid me speak.
See, and then speak yourselves.
Awake!
Awake! Ring the alarm bell!
Murder and treason!
Malcolm and Donalbain!
Banquo! Awake!
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit, and look on death itself!
Up! Up!
And see the great doom's image.
Fleance! Banquo!
Rise up as from your graves...
...and walk like spirits to countenance this horror.
Ring the bell!
What's the business, that a hideous trumpet calls...
...to parley the sleepers of the house? Speak!
Gentle lady, 'tis not for you to hear what I speak.
Banquo, our royal master's murdered.
Woe, alas!
What, in our house?
Too cruel anywhere.
I prithee, contradict thyself, and say it is not so.
Had I but died before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time.
There is nothing serious in mortality.
All is but toys.
Renown and grace is dead.
- What is amiss?
- You are, and do not know it.
Your royal father's murdered.
By whom?
Those of his chambers, it seemed, had done it.
They were all badged with blood.
So were their daggers.
O, yet I do repent me of my fury that I did kill them.
Wherefore did you so?
Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious...
...loyal and neutral in a moment? No man!
Here lay Duncan, his skin laced with his blood.
There the murderers, steeped in the colours of their trade.
Who could refrain, that had a heart to love?
And in that heart, courage to make his love known?
Let's briefly put on manly readiness and meet in the hall together...
...to question this most bloody piece of work.
Fears and scruples shake us.
In the great hand of God I stand.
Against the undivulged pretence
I fight of treasonous malice.
- So do I.
- So all.
What will you do?
Let's not consort with them.
- I'll to England.
- To Ireland, I.
Our separated fortune shall keep us both the safer.
Where we are, there's daggers in men's smiles.
This murderous shaft that's shot hath not yet lighted.
Therefore to horse.
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking.
Shift away.
- How goes the world, Macduff?
- Why? See you not?
Is it known who did this more than bloody deed?
- Those that Macbeth hath slain.
- What good could they expect?
They were suborned. Malcolm and
Donalbain, the king's sons, are fled...
...which puts upon them suspicion of the deed.
Then 'tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
He's already named and gone to Scone to be invested.
- Will you to Scone?
- No, cousin, I'll home to Fife.
Well, I will thither.
May you see things well done there.
Adieu.
Thou hast it now.
King, Cawdor, Glamis...
... all as the weird women promised.
And I fear thou play'dst
most foully for it.
Yet it was said it should not
stand in thy posterity.
But that myself should be
the root and father of many kings.
If there comes truth from them...
... may they not be
my oracles as well...
... and set me up in hope?
Hail, Macbeth!
Hail, King of Scotland!
Hail, Macbeth!
Hail, King of Scotland!
Here's our chief guest.
If he had been forgotten, it'd have been a gap in our great feast.
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, and I'll request your presence.
Let Your Highness command upon me...
...to the which my duties are with a most indissoluble tie forever knit.
- Ride you this afternoon?
- Ay, my lord.
Is it far you ride?
As far as will fill up the time
'twixt this and supper.
- Fail not our feast.
- My lord, I will not.
We hear our bloody cousins are in England and Ireland...
...not confessing their cruel parricide.
But of that tomorrow. Hie you to horse. Adieu till you return at night.
- Goes Fleance with you?
- Ay, my lord.
I wish your horses swift and sure of foot. Farewell.
- Attend those men our leisure?
- They do.
Bring them before us.
To be thus is nothing, but to be safely thus.
Our fears in Banquo stick deep.
In his royalty of nature...
...he hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour to act in safety.
There is none but he whose being do I fear.
And under him my genius is rebuked.
We'll keep ourself till suppertime alone. Till then, God be with you.
He chid the sisters, when first
they put the name of king upon me...
... and bade them speak to him.
Then, prophet-like they hailed him...
... father to a line of kings.
Upon my head,
they placed a fruitless crown...
... and put a barren sceptre
in my grip.
Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal
hand, no son of mine succeeding.
If it be so...
... for Banquo's sons
have I defiled my mind.
For them the gracious Duncan
have I murdered.
To make them kings.
The seeds of Banquo kings.
Stay within call.
- Was it not yesterday we spoke?
- It was, Your Highness.
Well then now, have you considered of my speeches?
Know that it was he in times past which held you under fortune...
...which you thought had been our innocent self.
You made this known to us.
Is patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go?
Are you so gospelled to pray for this man and for his issue...
...whose heavy hand has bowed you to the grave and beggared yours forever?
We are men, my liege.
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men.
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, shoughs...
...water-rugs and demi-wolves are clept, all by the name of dogs.
And so of men.
Now, if you have a station in the file...
...not in the worst rank of manhood, say it.
And I will put that business in your bosoms...
...whose execution takes your enemy off...
...grapples you to the heart and love of us...
...who wear our health but sickly in his life...
...which in his death were perfect.
I am one whom the vile blows and buffets of the world have so incensed...
...that I am reckless what I do to spite the world.
And I another.
Both of you know
Banquo was your enemy.
- Ay, my lord.
- So is he mine!
Though I could with barefaced power sweep him from my sight...
...and bid my will avouch it.
Yet I must not, for certain friends...
...that are both his and mine, whose loves I may not drop.
And thence it is, that I to your assistance do make love...
...masking the business from the common eye for sundry weighty reasons.
- We shall perform what you command.
- Your spirits shine through you.
It must be done tonight, and some way from the palace.
And with him, to leave no rubs nor botches in the work...
...Fleance, his son that keeps him company...
...whose absence is no less material to me than is his father's...
...must embrace the fate of that dark hour.
- Resolve yourselves apart.
- We are resolved, my lord.
Advise them where to plant themselves.
How now, my lord?
Why do you keep alone...
...of sorriest fancies your companions making?
Things without all remedy should be without regard. What's done is done.
We have scorched the snake, not killed it.
But let the frame of things disjoint.
Ere we'll eat our meal in fear...
...and sleep in the affliction of the terrible dreams that shake us nightly.
Better be with the dead...
...than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy.
Duncan is in his grave.
After life's fitful fever, he sleeps well.
Treason has done his worst.
Not steel, nor poison...
...malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing can touch him further.
Come on. Gentle, my lord.
Sleek o'er your rugged looks.
Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.
So shall I, love.
And so, I pray, be you.
Full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife.
Thou knowst that Banquo and his Fleance live.
But in them nature's copy is not eterne.
There's comfort yet.
They are assailable.
Then be thou jocund.
Ere the bat hath flown his cloistered flight...
...ere to black Hecate's summons...
...the shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums...
...hath rung night's yawning peal...
...there shall be done a deed of dreadful note.
What's to be done?
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, till thou applaud the deed.
Come, seeling night...
...scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day.
And with thy bloody and invisible hand cancel and tear to pieces...
...that great bond which keeps me pale.
Light thickens, and the crow makes wing to the rooky wood.
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse...
...while night's black agents to their prey do rouse.
- Who did bid thee join with us?
- Macbeth.
He needs not our mistrust since he delivers our offices...
...and what we have to do to the direction just.
Well, stand with us. The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.
And near approaches the subject of our watch.
By the clock 'tis day...
...and yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.
Is it night's predominance or the day's shame...
...that darkness does the face of earth entomb...
...when living light should kiss it?
It will be rain tonight.
Let it come down!
Treachery!
Fly, good Fleance, fly!
Fly!
Fly!
There's blood upon thy face.
- 'Tis Banquo's then.
- Is he despatched?
His throat is cut.
That I did for him.
Thou art the best of the cutthroats.
Yet he's good that did the like for Fleance.
If thou didst that, thou art the nonpareil.
Most royal sir, Fleance is escaped.
Then comes my fit again.
I had else been perfect, whole as
the marble, founded as the rock.
But now I am cabined, confined,
bound in to saucy doubts and fears.
- But Banquo's safe?
- Ay, my good lord.
Safe in a ditch he bides, with 20 trenched gashes on his head.
There the grown serpent lies.
The worm that's fled hath nature that in time will venom breed.
No teeth for the present.
Get thee gone.
Tomorrow we'll hear ourselves again.
You know your own degrees. Sit down.
At first and last, a hearty welcome.
Thanks to Your Majesty.
Our hostess keeps her state.
Ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host.
- My lord, you do not give the cheer.
- Sweet remembrancer.
I drink to the general joy of the whole table...
...and to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss. Would he were here.
Banquo!
Now good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both!
May it please Your Highness, sit.
Please it Your Highness to grace us with your royal company?
- The table's full.
- Here is a place reserved, sir.
- Where?
- Here, my good lord.
- Which of you have done this?
- What, my lord?
Thou canst not say I did it.
- Never shake thy gory locks at me.
- His Highness is not well.
Sit, friends. My lord is often thus and hath been from his youth.
Keep seat. The fit is momentary.
Upon a thought he will again be well.
Are you a man?
Ay, a bold one that dare look on that which might appal the devil.
O, proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear.
This is the air-drawn dagger you said led you to Duncan. Shame itself!
Why do you make such faces? When all's done, you look but on a stool.
Prithee, see there!
Behold! Look! How say you?
Avaunt, and quit my sight! Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold.
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes which thou dost glare with.
What man dare, I dare.
Take any shape but that, and my nerves shall never tremble.
Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal mockery, hence!
What?
Quite unmanned in folly.
- Lf I stand here, I saw him.
- Fie, for shame!
Blood hath been shed ere now, in the olden time.
And since too, murders have been performed too terrible for the ear.
Time has been that when the brains were out, a man would die...
...and there an end.
But now they rise again, with
20 mortal gashes on their crowns.
You've displaced the mirth, broke the meeting with most admired disorder.
Can such things be and overwhelm us like a summer's cloud...
...without our special wonder?
You make me strange, even to the disposition that I owe.
When now I think you can behold such sights...
...and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks...
...when mine is blanched with fear.
What sights, my lord?
I pray you, speak not, he grows worse and worse.
Question enrages him.
At once, good night.
Stand not upon the order of your going, but go at once.
Good night. And better health attend His Majesty.
Kind good night to all.
It will have blood.
They say blood will have blood.
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak.
What is the night?
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
How sayst thou, that Macduff denies his person at our great bidding?
How know you this, my lord?
I hear it by the way.
There's not a one of them, but in his house I keep a servant paid.
You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
Come, we'll to sleep.
I must again to the weird sisters.
More shall they speak.
For now I am bent to know, by the worst means, the worst.
For mine own good, all causes shall give way.
I'm in blood, stepped in so far that should I wade no more...
...returning were as tedious as go o'er.
Strange things I have in head that will to hand...
...which must be acted, ere they may be scanned.
We are yet but young in deed.
By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.
How now, you secret, black and midnight hags? What is it you do?
A deed without a name.
Double, double, toil and trouble.
Fire burn, cauldron bubble.
Toad that under cold stone, days and nights has 31.
Sweltered venom sleeping got, boil thou first in the charmed pot.
Eye of newt and toe of frog, wool of bat and tongue of dog.
Adder's fork and blindworm's sting, lizard's leg and howlet's wing.
Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips, slivered in the moon's eclipse.
Fillet of a fenny snake, in the cauldron boil and bake.
Liver of blaspheming Jew, gall of goat and slips of yew.
I conjure you, by that which you profess, howe'er you know it.
- Answer me to what I ask you.
- Speak!
- Demand.
- We'll answer.
Say if thou'dst hear it from our mouths, or from our masters.
Call them, let me see them.
Cool it with a baboon's blood, then the charm is firm and good.
- Tell me, unknown power...
- He knows thy thought.
Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth.
Beware Macduff.
Beware the Thane of Fife.
Thou hast harped my fear aright.
- But one word more...
- He will not be commanded.
Be bloody, bold and resolute.
Laugh to scorn the power of man.
For none of woman born
shall harm Macbeth.
None of woman born shall harm Macbeth.
Then live Macduff.
What need I fear of thee?
But I'll make assurance double sure and take a bond of fate.
Thou shalt not live!
- Macbeth shall never vanquished be.
- Never, never.
Until Great Birnam Wood...
...to high Dunsinane Hill shall come against him.
That will never be!
Who can recruit the forest?
Bid the tree unfix his earth-bound root?
Sweet bodements, good!
Yet my heart throbs to know one thing:
- Shall Banquo's issue ever reign?
- Seek to know no more.
I will be satisfied! Deny me this and an eternal curse fall on you!
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo.
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs.
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
Now I see 'tis true.
For the blood-boltered Banquo smiles upon me...
...and points at them for his!
Where are they?
Gone!
Infected be the air whereon they ride!
And damned all those that trust them!
Macduff is fled.
- Where does he bestow himself?
- In the English court.
Where lives the son of Duncan.
Thither Macduff is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid...
...to wake Northumberland and warlike Seyward.
By the help of these, we may again give to our tables meat...
...sleep to our nights, our feasts free from bloody knives.
Some holy angel fly to England...
...that a swift blessing may soon return to this, our suffering country.
Gentle lady.
Gracious Duncan's dead.
Gracious Duncan was pitied of Macbeth. Marry, he was dead.
The valiant Banquo walked too late.
Whom, you may say, Fleance killed, for Fleance fled.
Man must not walk too late.
How monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their father.
Damned, indeed.
How it did grieve Macbeth.
- Had he Duncan's sons under his key...
- As, an't please heaven, he shall not.
They should find what it were to kill a father.
So should Fleance.
Peace.
What news?
Macduff is fled to England.
- Fled to England?
- Ay, my good lord.
Time, thou anticipat'st
my dread exploits.
The castle of Macduff
I will surprise. Seize upon Fife.
Give to the edge of the sword
his wife, his babes...
... and all unfortunate souls
that trace him in his line.
No boasting like a fool.
This deed I'll do
before the purpose cool.
You must have patience.
He had none. His flight was madness.
Our fears do make us traitors.
You know not if it was wisdom or fear.
To leave his wife and his babes in a place from whence himself does fly?
He loves us not.
He wants a natural touch.
The wren, the most diminutive bird, will fight...
...her young in the nest, against the owl.
- All is the fear, nothing is the love.
- Dear coz, pray, school yourself.
But for your husband, he is noble, wise, judicious...
...and best knows the fits of the season.
I take my leave of you. Shall not be long but I'll be here again.
Things at their worst will cease...
...or else climb upward to what they were before.
My pretty cousin, blessing upon you.
Fathered he is, and yet he's fatherless.
I take my leave at once.
- How wilt thou do for a father?
- How will you do for a husband?
Why, I can buy me 20 at any market.
- Was my father a traitor?
- Ay, that he was.
- What is a traitor?
- Why, one that swears and lies.
Be all traitors that do so?
Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be hanged.
- Who must hang them?
- The honest men.
The liars are fools, for there are enough of them to hang the honest men.
- God help thee, poor monkey.
- Lf he were dead, you'd weep for him.
Where's your husband?
I hope in no place so unsanctified, where such as thou mayst find him.
He's a traitor.
- Thou liest, thou shag-eared villain!
- What, you egg?
Young fry of treachery!
He has killed me, Mother.
Besides her walking and other actual performances, what has she said?
That which I will not report after her.
You may to a doctor.
'Tis most meet you should.
Neither to you, nor anyone, having no witness to confirm my speech.
- Her eyes are open.
- Ay, but their sense is shut.
- What is it she does now?
- An accustomed action.
To seem thus washing her hands.
Yet here's a spot.
Out, damned spot.
Out, I say!
One.
Two.
Why then 'tis time to do it.
Hell is murky.
Fie, my lord, fie!
A soldier and afeard?
What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?
Yet who'd have thought the old man to have so much blood in him?
Well, well!
The Thane of Fife had a wife.
Where is she now?
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?
No more of that, my lord.
You mar all with this starting.
Go to. You have known what you should not.
She has spoke what she should not,
I am sure of that.
Here's the smell of blood still.
All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
What a sigh is there!
The heart is sorely charged.
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown.
Look not so pale.
I tell you, Banquo's buried.
He cannot come out of his grave.
Even so?
To bed, to bed.
Come. Come.
Come, give me your hand.
What's done cannot be undone.
To bed, to bed.
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God! God forgive us all.
Look after her. Remove from her means of annoyance and keep eyes upon her.
- Good night.
- Good night, good doctor.
How does your patient, doctor?
Not so sick, as she's troubled with fancies that keep her from her sleep.
Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased?
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow?
Raze out the written troubles of the brain?
And with some sweet, oblivious antidote...
...cleanse the bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart?
Therein the patient must minister to himself.
Throw physic to the dogs.
Bring me no more reports.
Let them fly. All!
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear.
What's the boy, Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman?
The spirits that know all mortal consequences pronounced me thus:
"Fear not. No man that's born of woman shall e'er have power upon thee."
Then fly, false thanes...
...and mingle with the English epicures!
Our country sinks beneath the yoke.
It weeps, it bleeds.
And each new day a gash is added to her wounds.
Each new morn new widows howl, new orphans cry.
New sorrows strike heaven on the face...
...that it resounds as if it felt with Scotland.
Who comes here?
A countryman who seems a stranger to us.
My ever gentle cousin.
Welcome hither.
- Stands Scotland where it did?
- Alas, poor country.
Afraid to know itself. It cannot be called our mother, but our grave.
- What's the newest grief?
- Each minute teems a new one.
- How does my wife?
- Well.
- And my children?
- Well too.
- The tyrant has not battered at them?
- No. They were well at peace.
Be not a niggard of speech.
How goes it?
Your eye in Scotland will create soldiers, make our women fight.
We are coming thither.
Gracious England hath lent us good Seyward and 10,000 men.
An older and a better soldier none that Christendom gives out.
Would I could answer this comfort with the like.
But I have words that will be howled out...
...where hearing should not catch them.
- What concern they?
- The main part pertains to you.
If it be mine, keep it not from me.
Quickly, let me have it.
Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes slaughtered.
Merciful heaven.
What, man!
Ne'er put your hat upon your brows.
Give sorrow words.
My children too?
Wife, children, servants.
All that could be found.
- And I must be from thence. My wife?
- I have said.
Be comforted. Let's make us medicines of our great revenge...
...to cure this deadly grief.
He has no children.
All my pretty ones!
Did you say all?
Hell-kite! What, all my chickens and their dam at one fell swoop?
Dispute it like a man.
I shall do so, but I must also feel it as a man.
I cannot but remember such things were...
...that were most precious to me.
Did the heaven look on and would not take their part?
Sinful Macduff, they were struck for thee.
Not for their own demerits, but for mine, fell slaughter on their souls.
Heaven rest them now.
Be this the whetstone of your sword.
Let grief convert to anger.
Blunt not the heart, enrage it!
Gentle heavens, cut short all intermission.
Front to front bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.
Our power is ready.
Macbeth is ripe for shaking.
Within my sword's length set him.
If he escape, heaven forgive him too.
- What does the tyrant?
- Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
Some say he's mad. Others, that lesser hate him, call it valiant fury.
Those he commands move in command.
Nothing in love.
He feels his title hang loose about him...
...like a giant's robe upon a dwarfish thief.
All that is within him does condemn itself.
The English power is near, led by Malcolm, Seyward and Macduff.
Near Birnam Wood shall we meet them.
That way are they coming.
The devil damn thee black, thou loon!
Where gotst thou that goose look?
There is 10,000...
- Geese? Villain?
- Soldiers, sir.
Thou lily-livered boy.
What soldiers, patch?
Those linen cheeks of thine are counsellors to fear.
What soldiers, whey-face?
The English force, so please you.
Seyton! Take thy face hence.
I am sick at heart, when I behold...
Seyton, I say!
I have lived long enough.
My way of life is fallen
into the sear, the yellow leaf.
And that which should accompany
old age, as honour, love...
... obedience, troops of friends...
... I must not look to have.
But in their stead, curses...
... not loud, but deep.
Mouth-honour...
... breath which the poor heart
would fain deny and dare not.
- Seyton!
- What's your gracious pleasure?
- What news more?
- All is confirmed which was reported.
I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked! Give me my armour!
- 'Tis not needed yet.
- I'll put it on.
Send out more horses, scour the country.
Hang those that talk of fear.
Come, put mine armour on, give me my sword.
Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
Come, sir, despatch.
If thou couldst, doctor, cast the water of my land...
...find her disease and purge it to a sound and pristine health.
I would applaud thee to the very echo that should applaud again.
Pull it off, I say.
What rhubarb, senna or what purgative drug...
...would scour these English hence?
Hearst thou of them?
Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation makes us hear something.
I will not be afraid of death or bane...
...till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.
Were I from Dunsinane away and clear...
...profit again should hardly draw me here.
- What wood is this before us?
- The wood of Birnam.
"They met me in the day of success.
And I have learned by the perfect'st report...
...they have more in them than mortal knowledge.
While I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came...
...missives from the king, who all-hailed me, Thane of Cawdor...
...by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me...
...and referred me to the coming on of time with:
'Hail, king that shall be! '
This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner...
...that thou mightst not be...
...ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell."
Hang out our banners on the outward walls.
The cry is still, "They come!"
Our castle's strength will laugh a siege to scorn.
Here let them lie till famine and the ague eat them up.
Were they not stuffed with those that should be ours...
...we might have met them dareful, and beat them backward.
What is that noise?
I've almost forgot the taste of fear.
The time has been, my senses would have cooled to hear a night-shriek.
My fell of hair...
...would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in it.
I have supped full with horrors.
Wherefore was that cry?
The queen, my lord, is dead.
She should have died hereafter.
There would have been a time for such a word.
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
... creeps in this petty pace
from day to day...
... to the last syllable
of recorded time.
And all our yesterdays have lighted
fools the way to dusty death.
Out, out, brief candle.
Life's but a walking shadow.
A poor player struts and frets his hour upon the stage...
...and then is heard no more.
It is a tale told by an idiot...
...full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
Gracious, my lord!
Thy story, quickly!
I should report that which I saw, but know not how.
Well? Say, sir.
As I did stand my watch,
I looked toward Birnam.
And anon, methought, the wood began to move.
Liar and slave!
Within a mile may you see it coming.
A moving grove.
If thou speakst false, upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive...
...till famine cling thee.
Fear not till Birnam Wood
do come to Dunsinane.
And now a wood comes
towards Dunsinane.
Every soldier hath downed a bough and bears it before him.
Thereby they shadow the number of their host...
...and make discovery err in report of them.
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun.
And wish the estate of the world
were now undone.
Ring the alarum bell!
Blow, wind! Come, wrack! At least we'll die with harness on our back.
Make all our trumpets speak.
Worthy Macduff, you, with young
Seyward, lead our first assault.
Tyrant, show thy face!
Let me find him, Fortune.
And more I beg not.
If thou be slain and with no sword of mine...
...my wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
- What is thy name?
- Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
No, though thou callst thyself a hotter name than any in hell!
My name's Macbeth!
The devil could not pronounce a title more hateful.
- No, nor more fearful.
- Thou liest, abhorred tyrant!
With my sword
I'll prove the lie thou speakst.
Thou werest born of woman.
They have tied me to the stake.
I cannot fly. But bearlike
I must fight the course!
Why should I play the Roman fool and die on mine own sword...
...while I see lives that gashes do better on them?
What's he that was not born of woman?
Such a one am I to fear, or none.
Turn, hell-hound! Turn!
Of all men else, I have avoided thee.
I have no words.
My voice is in my sword.
Thou bloodier villain than terms can give thee out!
My soul...
...is too much charged with blood of thine already.
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests.
I bear a charmed life...
...which must not yield to one of woman born!
Despair thy charm and let the angel whom thou hast served tell thee...
...Macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripped.
Accursed be that tongue
that tells me so...
... for it hath cowed
my better part of man.
And be these juggling fiends no more
believed that palter with us.
That keep the word of promise
to our ear and break it to our hope.
I will not yield...
...to kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet...
...and to be baited with the rabble's curse!
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane...
...and thou opposed being of no woman born...
...yet I will try the last.
Lay on, Macduff.
And damned be him that first cries,
"Hold, enough!"
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
Hail, king, for so thou art.
Behold where lies the usurper's cursed head.
The time is free.
Hail, King of Scotland!
Hail, King of Scotland!

Stop!
Here!
This is the boss. Let's go!
Shit! Let's get out of here.
Stop there.
There's no doubt. It was anarchists who placed the bomb.
This is their "signature", gentlemen.
Minister, you must know that it's easier to falsify a flyer than to place a bomb.
After all, you are still alive Mr. Palmer.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Are not all these deportations illegal?
25,000 already got deported...
Do you mean that the anarchist bombs against Morgan, Rockefeller and me are legal?
The objective of their attacks is to terrify the unions, the true enemies of capitalism.
You are poisoned by the red propaganda.
Your department is accused to infiltrate the unions.
Hundreds of spies and specialized provokers, a full special espionage unit.
Also you are poisoned by the red propaganda!
The Bishop of New York says:
The country is imprisoned by the panic and the hysteria.
Another infamous part of the history of the United States.
Is the Catholic Church also poisoned by the red propaganda?
The bishop take care of souls,
I take care of my country.
In Boston the Secretary of State declared:
"If we could... we would deport them and shoot them."
- Do you agree?
- Well, I wouldn't shoot them.
Why don't you say anything to us about Andrea Salcedo?
Like what?
How he mysteriously fell from the 14th floor of the Police Department.
You are an anarchist!
The Minister of Labor is in opposition to the deportations.
Is he perhaps also a red rebel?
Soon we will know who is the leader of the reds in our country.
Are you accusing the Minister of Labor?
I am not accusing anyone.
A few good quotes for the special edition...
- Who is it?
- My name is Boda, Mrs. Johnson.
- I'm here to get my car.
- One moment.
What's up?
It's the Italian, Mr. Boda, he's not alone.
Call the police.
Tell them that they are here.
I'll do that.
He's on the phone.
He's on the phone!
We shouldn't stay.
Sorry, we have to leave immediately.
No problem, I will help you tomorrow.
Stop it!
You're under arrest!
A Colt 32.
Found in the pocket of Nicola Sacco.
32 bullets of various brands.
One Harrington & Richardson, caliber 38, fully loaded.
Found in the pockets of the other fellow, Bartolomeo Vanzetti.
They deny illegal arms possession.
So what do you say?
Mr. Sacco, would you have the kindness to respond?
- We don't have permission to carry arms.
- I don't know how to express myself.
Italians, right?
U.S. citizens?
Anarchists.
You know, Mr. Sacco, you have nothing to fear.
- You understand me?
- More or less.
You said that you don't speak our language too well, but we will make everything to help you.
Do you understand me now?
Yes, everything.
Tell me, Mr. Sacco, why do you walk around armed?
- And with all this ammunition?
- These are difficult times.
Doesn't it strike you, Mr. Sacco, that in these difficult times not even a night watchman could go armed at night without permission to carry arms?
- What did you do in Bridgewater?
- I accompanied Vanzetti.
- He went to look for a friend.
- What friend?
- Poppy.
- Poppy?
Poppy, I know him only by that name.
An where did you meet this Poppy?
In the drugstore, like always.
And when meeting this Poppy at the drugstore, why did you come armed?
Well, I wanted to see Poppy to request him to help a friend.
I believe he wanted to sell him fish.
That was a good one, Mr. Sacco.
"I believe he wanted to sell him fish."
And what type of fish?
Hammerfish? Swordfish? Or flatfish?
Bartolomeo sells fish.
And what do you sell, Mr. Sacco?
Lies?
I'm a shoe factory worker.
Who were the other three on the tram?
I don't know them.
They were friends of Vanzetti,
I don't know them.
One of them is called Mike Boda.
Does that name mean anything to you?
No.
So you go out armed at night, looking for Poppy, and end up at the house of Simon Johnson...
...and then with three guys on a tram.
Three guys who you say you don't know.
I don't understand politics.
- Union man?
- No.
Then you are an anarchist.
No.
Do you by any chance know... Andrea Salcedo?
No.
Today, Wednesday the 5th of May, 1920, we have interrogated two suspects...
...many contradictions...
Nicola Sacco, a shoe factory worker.
Wait.
The assault on the shoe factory on South Braintree...
...wasn't there shots fired from a Colt 32?
Hello?
Nicola Sacco or Nick Sacco.
Nicola.
Quiet.
It's been confirmed. Sacco did not attend his work on the 15 of April.
And the other case?
Nothing. No proof that the anarchist movement have received any larger sums of money until now.
The hats.
Put the hats on.
Hats off.
Very well.
Now pretend you're holding a gun.
The right arm!
More lifelike, please.
Come on!
They aimed upwards!
- What...?
- Quiet.
Don't move!
Turn against the wall.
They want to scare to us.
Now turn to the right.
You are lying, systematically.
Are you always lying?
I'm not lying.
You were armed, right, Mr. Vanzetti?
You're an idiot and a liar.
- Always lying.
- I'm not lying, I insist.
Are you an anarchist?
You understand me?
- Are you an anarchist?
- No!
A communist?
Mr. Vanzetti, don't make have to repeat all my questions. - No.
- A socialist?
- No.
Answer with "No, sir".
No, sir.
- Union man?
- No, sir.
Member of the mafia?
No, sir.
Where were you on the night of the 2nd of January?
Don't remember?
You're a liar, Mr. Vanzetti, a charming liar.
Do you recognize him?
Do you remember that day?
- Which day was it?
- The 2nd of January.
This year?
This year?
This year.
And the 15th of April this year, where were you at 3 pm?
You want this question also repeated to you?
I'm trying to help you.
Today is Thursday 6th of May, three weeks since the 15th of April.
Simple, right?
Where were you on the 15th of April at 3 pm?
I was selling fish.
What's so funny about selling fish?
Where?
In Plymouth as usual.
You were not in Plymouth the night of the 2nd of January, nor any other night.
And if I showed you another photo, Mr. Vanzetti, a photo taken at 3 pm on the 15th of April, this year, 1920, showing you in South Braintree...
South Braintree?
As the District Attorney for the cities of Norfolk and Plymouth...
I formally accuse Bartolomeo Vanzetti for double homicide and robbery...
...together with Nicola Sacco
...and other unknown men.
These crimes were committed on the 15th of April at 3 pm, on Pearl Street, South Braintree, in front of the Slater & Morris shoe factory where a bloody assault occurred in which
Frederick Parmenter, the company's cashier, and a guard, Alessandro Berardelli, were shot dead.
I don't believe you mean this seriously.
Take him away.
What are you doing?
- Take him away.
- What are you doing?
How can you?
Damn you!
Bastard! Damn you!
Let go of me!
- Bartolomeo!
- Nicola, Nicola!
Homicide!
Homicide, Nicola!
Homicide, Nicola!
- Bartolomeo! Bartolomeo!
- Homicide, Nicola!
Let me out of here!
Remember your promise, don't make this political.
Have faith in us, madam.
Moore have defended many striking workers.
He is the lawyer all unions have trust in.
He knows what to do.
Just stay calm, Mrs. Sacco.
The District Attorney agrees to not make this a political trial.
But outside...
Court in session!
Attention.
The state and commonwealth of Massachusetts. versus Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, both present, arrested in the afternoon on the
5th of April, 1920, in Brockton, formally charged for double homicide and robbery. on Pearl Street, South Braintree
The shooting started here.
Mr. Bostock...
You were closest to the scene.
At what distance...
...were you when Parmenter and Berardelli went down?
I would say about five or six yards.
So you saw both bandits when they shot?
Yes.
Would you recognize both the accused or at least one of them?
One of the bandits who was shooting in South Braintree?
I'm not sure.
When the shooting started, Mr. Spencer, you were the first on the scene.
What did you see?
I saw the guard Berardelli lying on the ground...
A man was shooting at him.
- This man, what did he look like?
- He had dark, wavy hair, cut short in the back.
What was your distance to that man?
About 4 or 5 yards.
- Is that man in this room?
- Yes.
Can you point him out?
It's him!
Do you know his name?
The one without moustache.
Say his name.
- Nicola Sacco.
- Who? Me?
What are you saying!?
Nothing has changed, stay calm.
- The man driving the car?
- Blonde, pale.
Thin, blonde, pale, weak.
Dark skin, black moustache.
I'm not in any doubt, it was that man, Bartolomeo Vanzetti.
The train was coming.
The crossing barriers were down.
The car came towards me.
He aimed at me and said:
Put up the barriers!
- And another thing...
- Yes, what?
He called me a son of a bitch.
Only one small circumstance.
Vanzetti doesn't know how to drive.
Perhaps the man with the moustache...
...sat down in the car later...
And when you were confronted with a gun... you became confused...
- Objection.
Objection sustained.
I will reformulate the question.
Are you sure that the man with a moustache, identified as Vanzetti, was the driver?
- Well, not absolutely, but...
- But you are sure that... the face you remember is the face of the defendant?
Yes, sir.
In conclusion, Mr. Goodridge...
You heard the first shots when you were playing billiards.
First you went to the window but didn't see anything, then you heard more shooting and went outside.
At what did distance did you see the dark car?
More or less 6 yards.
And what more did you see?
I saw a dark-haired man who aimed at me with a pistol.
- Would you recognize him?
- Yes.
It's him, the man to the left.
- Are you sure?
- Completely.
Isn't there a pending trial in this court against the witness?
Then his testimony has no validity.
Dr. Moore!
When addressing a judge, please rise!
Understood, Dr. Moore?
You know or should know that the criminal records only mean something after pronouncing the sentence.
Cancel the question about the car.
I ran towards the window, the one facing Pearl Street.
I saw a dark car on the street, driving very fast.
I want to ask what distance it was.
Go on.
- You understand the question?
- Yes, sir.
Let's say... around 20 yards, and it can be verified.
Please continue.
I saw a bandit, the man over there...
Objection.
Very well, objection sustained.
The witness should only rely on facts.
- May I speak?
- Sure.
Well, I would say his face had some noticeable characteristics.
Fine features, high forehead, no beard.
Swept back hair style... his hair about 2 inches in length.
I noticed that his left hand... he held the gun in his right hand, of course, but the left hand was holding the arm support of the front seat.
I remember it well, it was a firm hand which gave an impression of strength...
- Do you also recall the dimple on his chin?
Mr. Moore!
How long did this extraordinary vision go on?
Objection. The defense asks the witness to guess, not to rely on facts.
Objection sustained.
However, the prosecution should ask the witness this question.
Answer the question.
I don't know exactly...
...perhaps one second.
And tell us, Miss Splaine, who is this bandit that you have described in such detail?
I already told you.
Nicola Sacco, without a doubt.
One moment, sir.
Thanks.
The car was found in the woods, not far away from here.
Marie Splaine stood in the window on the second floor.
There, Goodridge.
Spencer and other witnesses in those windows.
Levangie at the railroad crossing.
Those bullets were shot at Bostock.
Who tried to help the cashier.
That's all, gentlemen.
Miss Splaine, do you know that this case is resting on your testimony?
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.
You said you were about 20 yards from the car?
Yes.
In your opinion, what was the speed of the car?
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.
Miss Splaine...
Take a look at that man, the first on the second row to the right...
Can you tell me the color of his tie?
No, sir.
- I do not see well at that distance.
- How far would you say it is?
- Objection!
- I'd say it's less than 15 meters!
Do you want us to believe...
Young lady, tell us the truth... there's no shame in using eyeglasses.
It's true that when I'm at work...
I use eyeglasses all the time.
I forgot to say that, how stupid of me.
So you're saying there is no doubt that the man who was shooting was Sacco?
I have no doubts, no.
- No doubts?
- No, I already said that.
No?
Nevertheless, at the police station... you identified another man on a photo, and you said:
"This is the first one that I recognize."
Why have you changed your mind?
Answer the question.
I was confused.
When indicating the photo, or when indicating Nicola Sacco?
I didn't say it was him...
I just said that Mr. Sacco looks like the man that I saw in front of the factory.
But what did you really see?
Objection.
The defense is frightening the witness.
Objection sustained.
Very well, you may leave the stand, but not the court,
I'm not done with you.
- You were at the scene, together with Mr. Pelser? - Yes, sir.
Please tell us what you saw.
The shooting started...
Pelser threw himself to the floor, so did I.
We were lying next to each other
Only later did I get to the window.
I did in fact not see the men...
I only saw the number on the license plate.
Thank you, Mr. McCallum.
Mr. Wade works at the gas station.
That's here.
On his way home he passed, less than eight yards away, the car of the attackers... exactly here.
This is very serious...
You said before the man looked like Sacco...
Can you confirm that under oath?
I...
I'm not sure...
Finally an honest man.
And why are you not sure?
The truth is, that some time afterwards...
I saw another man at a barber-shop who also looked like the man who killed Berardelli.
Thank you, Mr. Wade.
As you all know.
The gentleman here is the only person who've said that the man who was driving the car had black moustaches, and that this man is Bartolomeo Vanzetti.
All the others say that the driver was blond or thin.
Then... the prosecution suggests you're saying that Vanzetti could have been the man that was seated behind the driver.
You saw a man leaning out of the car, but you didn't recognize him, right?
That's right, sir.
- You were here, right?
- Yes, sir.
That is wrong, totally wrong!
You said that you lowered the barriers, which means you were here, to the right, and not next to the driver.
After lowering the barriers, he could have crossed the street.
- Thank you, Mr. Katzman...
We still need to hear it from the witness.
- Yes, like that.
- Like what?
Like Mr. Katzmann said.
So you lowered the barriers and crossed the street and when the car came, you were there?
- Yes.
- Yes?
Too bad for Mr. Levangie, and the prosecution, that there are many witnesses, workers and neighbors, who give contradictory testimonies.
- Did Mr. Levangie stand near the sentry box?
- Yes.
On the left hand side?
Yes, sir.
I accuse Mr. Michael Levangie of giving false testimony.
- Silence.
Session suspended.
Seems like all is going well.
If we were just thieves it could go well.
But we are anarchists, that's not allowed.
Just watch them.
This trial may go wrong.
But who are you?
We worked for the committee, but without means.
The defense is our hope. - Who, Moore?
The comrade Moore?
He just looks for another legal victory.
I don't trust him.
Levangie has completely turned the trial.
The jury will have to listen to Bostock and the other witnesses again...
- Enrico, all well?
- Good work, Mr. Moore.
It's necessary to give him a lesson.
Let's enter.
This court... in rejecting the incrimination of Mr. Michael Levangie... it condemns the terrorist methods used by the defense when interrogating the witnesses.
They are making it a political process.
We have responsibilities that we should comply to.
We can't keep up with all witnesses changing their minds.
Attention, people waiting.
Please make room.
Don't worry, Nicola, everything will be fine.
I have much faith.
Step back!
We need to pass!
Dante!
Dante!
Dante!
Dante answer me!
Where are you?
Dante!
Dante.
What are you doing? What do you want?
Come with us.
Coward.
This will learn to change your testimony.
If they prohibit alcohol... they would also have to prohibit
French people...
The Irish...
English...
Quite many Italians. The Greek and Polish too.
- That's Boston.
- You forgot the Germans.
Do you mean D.A. Katzman, Mrs. Evans?
Here are your Germans, madam.
And Judge Thayer!
And finally, a few drops of Angostura.
The majesty of justice...
The concept of justice is rather bitter.
You don't believe in the innocence of those two, do you?
I don't know. All I know is that this is an ordinary trial.
Until recently, two anarchists like Sacco and Vanzetti, would have been deported.
But now they might end up in the electric chair.
It's an ordinary trial.
And after the attacks of Mr. Palmer, the American democracy will be pleased.
Mr. Thompson, the most famous lawyer in Boston, saying this is an ordinary trial?
A new cocktail?
Perfectly "Legal", Mr. Katzman, without one drop of alcohol.
I call it "Sidecar".
Why?
Perhaps everything started with a motorbike? A Sidecar?
Are you speaking about the trial against Sacco and Vanzetti?
Yes, a trial out of the ordinary.
It begins with a Sidecar and ends up with witnesses being beaten up.
Do you remember the man who worked in the gas station?
What are you insinuating, Mr. Rennie?
Excuse me.
The deportations were criticized and unpopular.
- However, an ordinary trial...
- A trial against two anarchists, Mr. Rennie.
Is it a crime to be an anarchist?
- Anarchists and immigrants.
- This is a country of immigrants.
How long have you been in America, Mr. Katzman?
I'm convinced that Sacco and Vanzetti have robbed and assassinated, and I will prove it.
The sentence will soon have some political meaning.
Captain Proctor, could you explain to us the results of the ballistic investigations.
This is a Colt 32 that belongs to Mr. Sacco.
This is a Harrington & Richardson 38 that belongs to Mr. Vanzetti.
The bullets are recognized by the caliber but also from when they were fired...
They rotate from left to right, or from right to left, leaving grooves in the bullet.
But the only type of American pistol that rotates from the left is a Colt 32.
Thank you, Captain, please be seated.
3 of the 4 bullets from the body of Berardelli... have right rotation.
The same for the two bullets taken from the body of Parmenter.
But the fourth bullet, the lethal bullet, has left rotation.
It was fired by a Colt 32.
Captain, after the ballistic tests, can you tell us if this bullet was shot by the Colt of Mr. Sacco?
In my opinion, it was probably shot by that pistol.
Sacco was not in South Braintree that day!
He couldn't have been in South
Braintree on the 15 of April.
Because that day he had requested a day off from the factory for serious personal reasons.
Dear son...
I understand that the death of your mother has caused you much sorrow.
She expressed how much she wanted to see you again before dying.
Don't forget to meet up...
"You do not know what it means to have a son live so far away, and for so many years."
"I hope we meet again."
"Longing to hold you close."
Mr. Consul, one moment please.
- Do you have any other documents?
- This is all I have.
I've never before been presented with any such photographs, so big, I mean.
There were two of them, I think.
It was the day of the 15th of April.
I remember because I looked at the wall calendar hanging on the wall in the office.
Yes, it was at 2 pm or perhaps a little later.
I recall that day also because I closed the consulate half an hour later.
With so many people visiting the consulate, you said you're receiving between
150 and 200 visitors every day,
...that's correct, right?
- Uhu.
You must have an incredible memory...
That day, how was the defendant dressed?
I don't remember that, only the peculiar photograph.
Let's talk about another peculiar date... the 17, 19, 21 , 24 or 29th of April.
- Listen...
- Choose any date,
2nd of May, or the 3rd or 4th, or the 6th.
Yes, I remember another peculiar thing that happened on the 1st of May... but last year.
When the consulate was full of immigrants that requested protection from Attorney General Palmer.
Those are true facts!
Mr. Adrower, just answer the questions.
Mr. Palmer is the Attorney General of the United States... and you are the representative of a foreign country.
You should pay respect to... and... answer the questions.
So you don't remember any other peculiar events at the Italian consulate, except the one involving Mr. Sacco?
Yes, sure, if you prefer it that way, Mr. Katzman.
Mr. Kelly...
Have a good look at this cap, including the inside.
Do you notice something?
Yes, the lining is broken.
Didn't you say that Sacco used to hang his cap on a nail?
Yes, but not...
Is this the cap of Mr. Sacco?
- It seems too small.
- If it would be larger though, it would be Mr. Sacco's, right?
- Objection!
Well, Mr. Sacco... can you put it on?
No.
What do you mean? You must put it on.
I'm no clown.
Mr. Sacco, nobody disrespects you, but you must put on the cap.
No, properly.
No, properly, I said.
Enough!
On the 15th of April,
I was in Plymouth, like every morning.
Bart! You want a cup of coffee?
I already had one, thanks, actually two.
Fish!
Big, tasty and fresh!
Fish!
Looks good, seems fresh.
Smell.
- Would that be all?
- Yes.
How do you remember the time being 12.30?
I am a craftsman... and I leave my workplace at 12.30, at the sound of the siren.
And why do you remember it was the 15th of April?
...and not the 13th, or 14th?
I don't remember it that way, but because I buy fresh fish every Thursday.
It doesn't stay fresh more than a week.
Could it be another week, the 8th or 22nd of April?
Listen...
Could it be another week, the 8th or 22nd of April?
What are you saying?
On April 8 I was operated for my appendix. Look here.
Thank you.
And I had only one.
I was operated for my appendix on the following day, and...
- And what..?
- He says it was his only appendix.
Mrs. Brini, have you known
Mr. Vanzetti for a long time?
Ever since I arrived in
Plymouth four years ago.
- He lives in your house?
- Yes.
- Do you like lodging him?
- Yes.
Do your husband like it?
Objection!
With the permission of the defense...
In case of necessity... would you make a sacrifice to save a friend?
Specially if he's Italian?
- Objection!
- What's wrong?
Mr. Katzmann, omit the last part of the question.
Omit "Specially if he's Italian."
Would you do anything for a friend?
- Of course.
- Answer yes or no.
You remember where you were on the 15th of April, because you bought a dress...
...quite peculiar, no?
People like me do not buy dresses every day.
- We talked about it also.
- You talked about it?
- We reconstructed everything.
- Reconstructed? With whom?
With my husband and the neighbors.
Also with the man with appendicitis?
Of course.
Thank you, Mrs. Brini.
The ballistic tests established that at least one bullet, the one that killed Berardelli, came from the pistol of Mr. Sacco.
With such evidence, scientific and indisputable, all arguments of the defendant collapse like a house of cards.
Tens of witnesses have declared...
But what kind of witnesses?
A row of pitiful people... from the underbelly of our society.
Ragged!
They hate us!
Silence!
The prosecution...
The prosecution has shown that the defendants were present at the violent robbery in South
Braintree on the 15th of April
I don't want to offend anyone, but the Italian witnesses are not trustworthy.
Mr. Katzmann, moderate your language.
Moderate? This is racism!
- Racism!
Do you want to end up on the defendants' bench, Mr. Moore?
The defendants' bench is the most untainted place in this room.
Mr. Moore!
We confront reality, we examine it well...
We are uncivilized!
Italians, Greeks, Poles,
Puerto Ricans, Chileans.
It takes efforts and pain trying to settle in a superior society trying to assimilate to our way of life and thought.
This is racism!
Members of the jury...
The defense talks of racism, it opposes testimonies from honorable American citizens, in favor of irresponsible and scrupulous witnesses, a bunch of poor immigrants, people who do not know anything about our national principles, about the grand ideals of our democracy, and the justice that reigns in our country.
People who don't speak our language.
Racism! Racism!
These are the same ideas of the fanatics in the Ku Klux Klan.
They poison America. Ku Klux Klan!
One more word, Mr. Moore, and I'll charge you for contempt in court.
Continue, Mr. Katzmann.
They represent the greatest danger to our free institutions.
We must be perceptive, certainly, but not until the point of...
Racism! Racism! Ku Klux Klan!
The Californian lawyer, the indescribable Mr. Moore, mention the Ku Klux Klan.
Does he know that bonds also exist between the immigrants?
That there are deviant blood ceremonies among Italians, where the blood of the teacher is mixed with the blood of the disciple... that's perverted!
Barbarians! Barbarians!
Thank you, Mr. Thompson, for coming to the defense committee, but I don't agree with you.
The objective of the court, whatever the cost, is to reach a just sentence.
I'm not so sure about that.
Whatever the cost, they want to reach a political sentence.
That's the reason of the justice.
Such premise does not lead to any acquittal.
Why do you think that they would be acquitted?
I believe in justice.
But Mr. Thompson, everything is so obvious.
I asked myself the same as Mr. Moore...
Speak out, forget formalities.
We are all convinced that Sacco and Vanzetti are innocent.
They are.
But then where are those truly guilty?
We will know in time!
I just wanted to say...
Have they done something to find them?
To find them?
Why not ask the police, or Thayer, or Fuller!
This way you aren't of much help.
You don't seem to believe that the police, the judge, or the governor are in agreement of a sentence, to whatever the cost.
Do you mean you were convinced that they don't wanted to mix the trial with politics?
That is right.
I made that mistake.
I ask the court to interrogate the defendant
Bartolomeo Vanzetti.
When did you arrive in the
United States, Mr. Vanzetti?
Thirteen years ago, in 1908.
Were you an anarchist already then?
- Not completely.
- Please explain.
When I saw how bad things were in my country
I thought things here would be different.
Is that why you became an anarchist here?
Let's say that I finished my radicalizing here, as I began working in a factory,
13 years old, to support myself.
And you ended up being an anarchist?
I am still an anarchist...
Everyone here is.
I don't understand the reason of this farce.
Mr. Vanzetti...
Why did you lie to the police officers in Brocton the night you were arrested?
I was scared.
Scared of what?
Mr. Moore...
I'll tell you what I and
Nicola was doing that night.
We were returning propaganda material to the houses of comrades, in order to hide it.
For that reason we needed Boda's car.
We knew also... that another one of those big "razzias" against foreigners was being prepared.
And two days earlier... the body of... one of our comrades... was found... at dawn.
Mr. Vanzetti.
And I'm saying his name:
Andrea Salcedo!
Andrea Salcedo, our comrade!
He was found dead after falling from the 14th floor of the building of the
New York City Police Department!
Bravo, Vanzetti.
We were scared.
And that's why you were armed, I suppose.
Have you ever fired a gun, Mr. Vanzetti?
No, I've never fired a gun in my life.
I don't even know how to point a gun.
Or how to drive a car.
Please... tell to the court why you were armed.
We had really thought of throwing them away.
We had brought all the bullets that we had kept in our drawers.
Mr. Sacco, did you need weapons that night like one of those guards would do?
We did, but we wanted to throw them anyway, it was too dangerous.
Why didn't you apply for a firearms license?
It's not easy in this country for an anarchist to get permission to carry arms.
Like in any country, Mr. Sacco.
Yes.
In any country.
You don't love this country, do you?
Why do you say that?
I love this country.
Did you also love it in May of 1917?
That is not so easy to explain...
You didn't understand the question?
You need the interpreter?
No, it's not necessary, I understood.
Then answer with a yes, or a no.
Yes.
You say you loved this country... but when you needed to serve it as a soldier you ran away to Mexico?
- Let me explain...
- Answer yes or no.
Did you run away to Mexico to avoid serving the country that you love?
- But I'm a worker.
Did you run away to Mexico in May, 1917?
Yes, I did.
Finally!
It's difficult to get an answer from this gentleman.
- Why did you run away?
- Because I'm an anarchist worker!
Which means..?
It means that the anarchists believe in a world without borders.
I understand.
We are objectors of conscience.
Do you love the government of the United States?
I do not love the government of the United States.
Is that why we see bombs against ministers and bankers of the state?
I've never put any bombs, or shot any shots.
You never put any bombs.
You don't believe in bombs then?
I believe in anarchism.
But what type of anarchism is it that you want to create?
- Could you explain that to the court?
- Anarchism means freedom.
The abolition of societies divided by classes.
Respect for the other.
- Enough!
- To me, these are the things that matter in life.
I try to live my life following these ideals.
Here are the arguments of the prosecution!
Workers who fight against their bosses.
Only to shorten unacceptable work hours, of 16, 17, 18 hours per day, and to ask for better wages.
This is the true meaning of this trial.
To cause harm to workers and to the unions, through an infamous campaign against foreigners.
Counselor, I demand silence!
It wouldn't have been allowed for a defendant to distribute documents to the jury.
I give you a serious reprimand.
Take those photographs back.
Very good!
Bravo!
Silence!
Otherwise I will expel you.
So you hand out anarchist leaflets, but know nothing about bombs.
And speak of love for your neighbor, but walks around armed.
You love this country but when you are asked to serve it you run away to Mexico.
Why didn't you stay in Mexico?
It's a free country.
I didn't do well there, I couldn't find work in my trade.
After all sacrifices I made to learn my trade,
I wouldn't go to Mexico to work with anything.
So your relation with the United
States is just a work relation, measured by how much money you get.
Mr. Sacco, this is the love you have for our country, isn't it?
Measured in dollars and cents.
- Objection!
- Objection overruled.
The defense have introduced these kind of arguments. Please continue.
-  May I speak?
- Request granted.
You speak of dollars and cents, sir.
Lets speak about millions of dollars.
If you speak of an industry manager or the head of a bank who donates money to a university everybody says:
What a great man he is!
But I have worked 13 years in this free country, doing what I've been told to.
I have worked like a slave and still I don't own anything, not a single dollar.
In here, all you here is:
"Passport, passport!"
But when I went to the consulate to organize my journey back, to be repatriated...
I didn't even have money to pay for the trip!
After thirteen years I would return to my homeland with nothing.
Like when I started.
Sit down.
This is why I became an anarchist,
I just wanted to live a decent life... that our children would get education, a good start.
White, blacks that's not important.
However, the capitalist class who just accumulate money in the banks and command young people to go to war, to death...
We don't want that.
We don't accept it.
We don't accept the war.
What right does a man have to kill another man?
I work with German friends who treat me like a brother.
Why should I kill them?
Morgan and Rockefeller are not the great men of this country, sir.
I have seen better people than them.
Some are in the jail, like Eugenio Debs, a great man of this country.
He is also imprisoned because he is socialist.
They are great people who make this country progress.
I love this country because of them.
I don't have more to say.
Thanks to the court for its kind tolerance, and for listening to what one of the defendants have to say about our institutions.
Remember what you have heard and what has been documented.
This is just a small part of the red and anarchist activity against our country.
At this point I want to ask you to remember and reenact, in all its aspects, the purpose of the assault in South Braintree.
The verdict can be only one.
I have nothing more to say.
Thank you.
For you it's more or less the same, isn't it?
Sure, my wife has been feeling lonely all the time I have been here.
- Sheriff, we are finished.
- Already?
That was fast, it's just five o'clock.
You have only used less than two hours.
A bit hasty perhaps. - Hasty?
Yes, perhaps you're right.
Did you say five o'clock?
Then we can have another meal, courtesy of the state.
Come!
Come, they are here!
Attention.
It looks like armed Italians have come from New York to liberate the convicts.
Keep your eyes open.
Press.
Today they check everyone.
They suspect something.
- Do you know why?
- They must be scared.
The time has come.
Don't worry.
They are 5 hours delayed, that is a good signal.
Court in session!
Mr. Chairman.
- Have you reached a verdict?
- Yes.
Nicola Sacco!
Bartolomeo Vanzetti!
Mr. Chairman, raise your right hand and turn to the defendants.
Defendants, listen to the chairman of the jury.
Mr. Chairman,
Do you declare the defendants guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
- Guilty of murder?
- Murder.
- In the first degree?
- In the first degree.
Do the jury declare under oath that the defendants, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, are guilty of murder in first degree?
Yes.
- Is that your verdict?
- That's our verdict.
Is that the verdict of all members?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That's our verdict.
Nico! They want to kill you!
I don't understand this sentence. It's absurd.
It is an absurd sentence.
Vanzetti, this is a conspiracy.
Sacco, it's clearly a conspiracy.
We will appeal.
Shut up!
We must. It's a conspiracy.
You and your politics.
We wont go to the electric chair.
Enough committees. I don't want to be a political martyr. I want to live.
To live!
I also want to live, but in another world.
Freedom for Nick and Bart.
Freedom for Nick and Bart.
No!
Freedom for Nick and Bart.
Nick and Bart, talk to us.
Nick and Bart, talk to us.
We are two unfortunates.
We have been deceived.
Freedom for Nick and Bart.
Freedom for Nick and Bart.
Look at this.
We will insist that the verdict is discharged, a very important filing.
- Perfect, make a copy of this.
First of all we must locate
Mary Splaine, Goodridge and Pelser, the key witnesses of the prosecution.
The police is attacking the protesters.
Everybody, come!
Freedom for Nick and Bart.
Clear! Clear!
Sergeant, this is abuse!
Are you wounded?
The strong arm of the law.
Where do you want to go?
To the Defense Committee?
Rennie, I don't want to see my name in the newspapers.
When it comes me, you can be calm.
Which means?
Somebody doesn't like what I write.
- They refused it?
- Uhu.
From now, Moore will be aided by Thompson, he is a great lawyer.
They are preparing an appeal.
I'm sure you will soon be released.
You are too far away, Rosa,
I want you near me.
Come closer.
I could not live without you.
I'm not able.
- Do you remember the night when...
- Nicola, you will soon be released.
I'm thinking of you all the time.
Most Americans are taking our side.
Your speech really impressed everyone.
They speak about you on the radio, in the newspapers too.
People are working... printing flyers with your picture.
- There are manifestations...
- No!
What's wrong, Nicola?
It's Moore who's asked you to say that, isn't it?
What are you saying?
Rosa...
We were going to return to Italy...
And now this...
Why?
- Can you tell me why?
- No, Nicola, nobody can.
Dante...
Come here. Come to your father.
What's wrong? Are you ashamed of me?
Are you ashamed of your father?
Because they say that
I'm a thief and a killer?
Get out of here.
Go now! Now!
Get out. They should all die.
Freedom for Nick and Bart.
No! They call me an assassin and a thief!
They say that I'm an assassin.
An assassin and a thief!
They say that I'm an assassin and a thief!
Thief, thief, thief...
Assassin and thief.
I know that your name isn't Goodridge at all... you're also a bigamist... and has been accused of swindle.
Or am I wrong?
Forgot everything during the interrogation, that's for sure!
And now, what happens?
What do you get in return for your false testimony?
You've been promised impunity, isn't that so?
I... can't stand this anymore.
You live in hiding, Pelser, like an animal.
No friends around, only policemen.
Why is that?
Are they forcing you?
Yes.
We have read the withdrawal statements, obtained by Mr. Moore... of the prosecution's witnesses
Mr. Pelser and Mr. Goodridge.
Pity that the Mr. Pelser and Mr. Goodridge also sent these declarations to the court, where they blame Mr. Moore for putting strong pressure on them.
Mr. Moore, your conduct is unprofessional.
The withdrawals are the results of intimidation.
Therefore your appeal, as presented here, is rejected.
You cannot speak of my professional conduct, sir, because during all this trial the court has used every occasion... to show its preconceived ideas... and its racist hatred of the defendants.
And to you, Mr. Katzmann, who uses scum like Pelser and Goodridge...
Be careful of what you say, Mr. Moore.
Only courtesy for this court prevents me from indicting you.
The court is suspended.
Mr. Feliciani said you will withdraw.
I'm thankful to you.
There were difficult moments and we didn't always understand.
But you are a good and honest man... and I'm very thankful to you.
Thompson will do better than I have.
He is more capable.
If I'd continue... it would all be the same.
Are you leaving immediately?
I have everything here.
This... and this.
- Please send us your articles.
- Good bye, counselor.
- I'm sorry.
- Good bye.
Good bye.
- Have a good trip, counselor.
- I'm very sorry.
I know who attacked the shoe factory...
I was there...
- What's your name?
- Celestino Madeiros.
I'll be damned...
We were five guys in the Buick that committed the robbery.
We changed car in a forest, and arrived in South Braintree around noon.
- Then we began to drink.
- Where did you know each other from?
I worked for some time with Barney at the Bluebird Inn.
It's in Providence, five miles across the Massachusetts border.
A very comfortable place... to rest in between one work and another.
- So you met the others there?
- Yes.
Are they from Providence?
What are their names?
No, I wont say that. I'm not an informer.
Tell us everything or tell us nothing.
I'm not a snitch.
So what makes you want to speak out now?
I saw Sacco... that was painful.
You have been sentenced to the electric chair... for robbery and homicide?
- Yes.
And now you're hoping for a delay..?
What's the benefit of that?
There are witnesses, maybe someone saw you shooting.
I didn't shoot anything in South
Braintree, I was drunk.
I was scared and stayed in the back seat of the car...
I didn't move a finger.
They fooled me, okay?
Back in the forest, when changing car, they fled with the loot and I never saw them again.
Where did you say you worked?
- Excuse me, does Barney live here?
- May!
- I'm looking for Barney.
- He's not here.
Is this his house?
It used to be.
Now it's a shanty.
Do you know Celestino Madeiros?
And who are you?
I'm a lawyer.
Well, you don't look like a police.
Did Madeiros work here in April of 1920?
I don't know, perhaps he was in Mexico.
No wait, he went there later.
He gave me a present... on the 1st of May.
He was always broke, but I remember that day, because he had 2800 dollars.
He lied, they didn't fool him.
After the robbery he had 2800 dollars...
Exactly a fifth of the loot in South Braintree
Here they are.
- Go back to your country!
- Bastards!
Yes, we had a gang here in Providence that used to rob cargo trains.
They were Americans of Italian descent.
Known as the Morell gang, or Morelli gang.
Arrested on the 8 of October of 1919.
Then they were in prison on the 15th of April, right?
I'll check that out.
Joe, Fred
Mancini, Pascuale Morelli.
Trials in May, 1920.
No, in April they were out on the street, released waiting trial.
- Thank you, inspector.
- You're welcome.
Excuse me, inspector.
Who was the lawyer defending
Morelli in May, 1920?
Don't speak to me about professional ethics when defending the Morelli gang of robbers, and the boss of it all, Joe.
He was bad.
But anyway... they had informants in the industrial areas.
They made notes about transport trucks, what was being loaded, for later use...
Mr. Geary, which were those factories?
There were many.
Everything is in the files.
"Rice & Hutchins", for example.
- That's all I remember.
- I see.
In South Braintree.
Everything is in the archives of the court.
Counselor!
The file of the trial isn't here.
No indications, sir, no suspicious talking.
Not even when he was delirious.
Only two names, always Rosa and Dante.
No messages from the outside either, except for letters controlled by you, sir.
If you prefer, sir, if you have other instructions...
I don't have, thank you.
I could write that your woman needs you, and your son too, but I ask you to recover, for the benefit of our comradeship.
And when I say comradeship,
I'm speaking about our innocence.
The truth, our ideas...
I'm speaking about our freedom.
Doctor... not today.
Please, not today.
- I want to improve without.
- If you want to improve... it means you are getting better, Nicola.
I am piano salesman.
What brand of pianos, Morelli?
Listen, if you're here to cut my hair...
Have you ever heard of South Braintree? do you know a Puerto Rican called Celestine Madeiros?
I've never known any Puerto Rican.
And Steve Bentkowski, this Polish guy?
No Poles either.
And this man? Bloody Gyp?
Nobody I know.
- What?
- He's never heard of him.
And I suppose you don't know Mancini.
Mancini who? There are so many Mancinis.
There are also many Morellis... but Mancini was in your gang.
Have you ever heard of
Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti?
Sacco.
Yes...
I read that he was prosecuted and tried for robbery.
Exactly. Do you know where?
Nicola Sacco. Sacco.
But if you know Mancini, why don't you ask him?
These men are Sacco and Vanzetti.
Have you ever seen them?
No.
They don't seem like types who do armed robberies.
It's hard to judge only by their faces, of course, but... they could be radicals and extremists, but they don't seem like robbers to me.
Do you think these two look alike?
No, not at all.
Did you use a Colt 32?
- No.
A Spanish pistol.
A Star.
During the trial... you said about the bullet that killed Berardelli:
"In my opinion it was probably shot by that pistol."
What does that mean?
It hoped that Moore would ask me more about that in the court, but he didn't. I would have said that... it could be several American pistols...
A Colt 32 can shoot that bullet, any Colt 32.
In other words, not necessarily the one of Sacco?
There's been no test proving it was Sacco's pistol.
You must have said that in the court.
You said several American pistols?
Yes... and an Austrian, the Steyr, and a Spanish who can shoot that type of bullet.
The Spanish Star.
Here's Mancini's weapon file...
It's a Spanish make, a Star Automatic, to be precise.
Can I see this pistol?
For an old friend?
Of course, come with me.
Only because it's you.
It never fails.
The archive-number is 33.410.52.
But...
This is Nicola Sacco.
- Nicola Sacco, without doubt.
- Thank you, Mrs. Splaine.
This is the man who fired on the guard.
He wore a beret.
He looks like many other men, but it's him alright.
- Very good, thank you.
- You're welcome.
Yes, he was one of them.
He's the man who was driving.
Unfortunately, Captain Proctor has passed away.
Therefore I must still rely on his testimony from the trial...
Why not bring in another expert?
As the previous test indisputably has proven the guilt of Nicola Sacco, all new attempts to reopen the trial are useless.
As for hearing Celestine Madeiros, who at the moment is on death row,
I must conclude that it is of no relevance.
It would be a groundless testimony from an unreliable man.
To annul the verdict based on this type of evidence would seriously undermine truth and justice.
You are the one that undermines justice.
No one dares to admit the mysterious disappearance of the Morelli case file, that Mancini's weapon has disappeared from the Attorney General's office in New York.
- What do you want to insinuate?
- I don't insinuate, I'm pointing at facts.
No, you're making accusations.
You're accusing me and a public office, and also ex-minister Palmer, who is now the Magistrate of the United States.
You accuse everybody of conspiracy to put
Sacco and Vanzetti in the electric chair.
Exactly my point.
The court hereby rejects the request to reopen the trial.
It is now the hope of the court that nothing will prevent the sentence.
I'm very thankful to you, Mr. Thayer.
You have helped me to completely lose the hopes
I have had for justice and for this nation.
I will never again put my foot in a courtroom.
Never more exert a profession that forces to me to deal with people like you.
People for whom I only feel the deepest contempt.
"Not even a dog deserves to die... based on the evidence presented in this trial.
- Radical?
- Conservative.
The Springfield Republican.
Very good. It speaks only of the most important matters.
- What's that?
- The petition asking you to intervene.
Signed by 474,842 people.
Here are more petitions, signed by the universities of
Yale, Columbia, Kansas, Ohio...
- Missouri, Minnesota...
- Just tell me the ones missing.
None, sir.
- Counselor Thompson, sir.
- Let him in.
In conclusion, to this date, our office has received more than
17,000 letters and telegrams.
I'm requesting that you hire more personnel.
- To reinforce the secretariat.
- Very well, we will speak about that.
- Adams.
- Sir?
Good morning, Mr. Thompson.
- Please be seated.
- Good morning, Mr. Fuller.
Governor, I've come to ask you to reopen the trial.
There are fair reasons to suspect bias of prosecutor Katzman...
- ...and of judge Thayer...
- Do you mind to sit down?
These are very serious accusations.
A cigar?
We are very far from the terror climate and persecutions established by Palmer.
Palmer is now gone... American democratic institutions have been restored...
- ...then, why...?
- Mr. Thompson...
I know what you're going to say and you know what my answer will be.
You want to save the lives of Sacco and Vanzetti?
You know I can't intervene in the decisions of judge Thayer.
There is only one way.
Bartolomeo Vanzetti, have you got anything to say before the sentence of death will be passed upon you?
Yes. I want to say that I am innocent.
In all my life I've never killed or robbed anyone.
I've never spilled a drop of blood.
I have fought for a better world.
I've fought exploitation of human beings.
That's the reason why I'm standing here now. None else.
There is something Mr. Katzman said, that keeps ringing in my mind:
"Mr. Vanzetti came to this prosperous country... in order to become rich!"
It's a phrase that amuses to me.
I never wanted to become rich.
That's not the reason why
I'm standing here now.
I'm paying for mistakes made by others.
I am suffering because I am a radical, and indeed I am a radical, and because I was an Italian, and indeed I am an Italian.
I am so convinced to be right that if you could kill me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times,
I would live again to do exactly the same.
Nicola Sacco.
My comrade Nicola!
Perhaps I'm a better babbler than he is, but many times, many times... when I hear his voice, when I think about him
This man... called thief and assassin and whom you are going to kill...
When your bones, Mr. Thayer, will be dispersed by time, and your name and your law are nothing but a deem rememoring of a cursed past, his name, the name of Nicola Sacco, will live in the hearts of the people.
We are thankful to you.
Without you, we would be nobody.
A good shoemaker... and a good fish-peddler, sure, but never in our full life could we hope to do so much work for tolerance, for justice, for man's understanding of man.
You have given meaning to the lives of two poor immigrants.
Nicola Sacco, have you got anything to say before the sentence of death will be passed upon you?
No.
On this day, the 9th of April, in the year of our Lord, 1927, this court sentence
Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti to suffer the punishment of death by electrocution of their bodies.
This is the sentence of the law.
Why don't you have a look?
Look out, it's beautiful.
Look.
What do you want to see, Bart?
Have you lost your hope?
After seven years...
I want an end to all this.
We've had discussions in the Committee.
Did you read the petition written by Thompson to Governor Fuller?
- Yes, I read it.
- And what do you think?
It's good.
Modify two or three things... but it's good.
- It's good.
- Did you sign it?
Yes, I signed it.
Virginia!
- Have you lost your faith?
- Nicola did not sign.
You know how Nicola is.
He has lost faith.
I hope that some comrade of the defense committee can make him change his mind.
Virginia.
Virginia!
Bartolomeo Vanzetti, sir.
Come here, Mr. Vanzetti.
I've been eager to meet you for a long time.
I am Governor Fuller.
Bartolomeo Vanzetti.
- I want to return to my cell.
- Please.
Have a seat.
So you are the famous Bartolomeo Vanzetti?
I've never had the intention to be famous.
But now you are.
You have submitted a petition in order to obtain my mercy, and to pardon you.
- Are you sorry?
- No.
It may sound strange, Mr. Vanzetti, but I would like to ask for your advice.
What would you do in my place?
You are the authority.
Let's see.
You are an anarchist,
I'm a conservative.
In addition I am the governor of one of the most conservative states in America.
What makes you think that
I would have mercy for you?
I understand what you mean.
Why should an anarchist believe in the mercy of the bourgeoisie.
I would like to know... how do you regard power relations within what you call bourgeoisie.
Mr. Fuller... you're ignoring my case, my petition for mercy.
You are fighting against a system... represented by president Coolidge, judge Thayer, the governor... and every guard of this prison.
Do you think that this chain, this system, is so weak that an important person, like a governor, would grant mercy for an anarchist, an enemy of the system?
So now you admit... that we were condemned for being anarchists, not for being thieves and assassins.
Well...
Suppose you were not an anarchist or a radical, and was accused of homicide, do you think you would have got such red-blooded reactions from the world?
Of course not, Mr. Vanzetti.
You do not appeal to the authorities like an ordinary citizen, but like an anarchist, supported by a global movement.
An act of mercy might cause certain opinions about challenging the system, or could be regarded as an act of weakness.
I only want justice, Mr. Fuller.
You don't think justice can be part of an authoritarian system.
What if you were in the power... would you grant mercy?
I don't ask for mercy, I only want justice.
But I want to repeat that this system is based on violence and not on justice.
You, Vanzetti, an anarchist, is talking about violence?
I've heard that nonsense for seven years now.
I already told you.
This is a society where we are forced to live, and we want to destroy any society based on violence.
To beg to be alive is violent.
The misery which we are subjects to.
So many men are violent.
Money is violent. The war.
Including the fear to die.
The fear that we all feel, every day, is also violent.
So, Mr. Fuller, don't simply say to me...
Bartolomeo Vanzetti, your petition is rejected.
Excuse me, Governor, remember that you have to be at the palace for the reception of Charles Lindbergh.
Very well.
I haven't decided yet.
Before my decision I wanted to speak with you.
You are a symbol, Mr. Vanzetti, but the man behind it is about to be executed.
What should we save?
The man or the symbol?
Nicola...
I just want to say that you did good not asking for mercy.
Only an assassin would do that.
My son, instead of crying be strong
Be brave and comfort your mother
Don't cry for the tears are wasted
Let not also the years be wasted
Forgive me, son, for this unjust death which takes your father from your side
Forgive me all who are my friends
I am with you, so do not cry
My dear son,
I have dreamed of you day and night.
I don't know if I'm alive or dead.
I would have liked to embrace you and your mother.
Forgive me, my son, for this unjust death which takes your father from your side.
Today they will crucify our bodies, but they can't destroy our ideas.
They are for the youth of the future to come, for young people like you.
Remember, my son... in the play of happiness, don't you use all for yourself.
Comfort those in need... your neighbor, those who cry, the persecuted, the oppressed.
To all who might need it.
Remember, my son... in the play of happiness, don't you use all for yourself.
Remember, my son... in the play of happiness...
They can't destroy our ideas.
They are for the youth of the future to come, for young people like you.
Good bye, my love.
My son.
Comrades.
According to the law,
I declare you dead.
One Sunday in 1828 a ragged boy was found abandoned in the town of N.
He could hardly walk and spoke but one sentence.
Later, he told of being locked in a dark cellar from birth.
He had never seen another human being, a tree or a house before.
To this day no one knows where he came from - or who set him free.
Don't you hear that horrible screaming all round you?
That screaming men call silence?
THE ENIGMA OF KASPAR HAUSER
Writing...
Wri...ting!
Remember that - writing.
If you write nicely now, papa'll give you a nice horsey.
Horsey...
Horsey!
- Horse.
- Horse.
Horsey!
Repeat after me...
I want to be a gallant rider... like my father was before me.
Say it! I want to be a gallant rider... like my father was before me!
Gallant rider.
Gallant rider like my father...
- Father...
- Father...
- ..was before me.
- ..was before me.
Remember that!
Remember that!
Come on, now.
Stand here.
Hold this letter.
The letter...
Stay right here...
Wait here. Wait for me here!
What do you want here?
Horsey!
I'm asking you what you want here?
Like my father was before me!
Ah, maybe it's that you don't know your way around here?
Can I be of service? Is it that letter there... you're wanting to bring?
Let's have a look at it.
"To the Cavalry Captain of the Fourth Squadron,
"Sixth Schwolische Regiment."
Let's see now, that'll be straight ahead... past Augustinergasse, round the corner, that's the Captain's house.
Should I take you there?
Or have you got other plans?
Say, where are you from, now?
Ansbach, Erlangen, Regensburg?
- Regensburg!
- Regensburg, good.
Come along, now!
This young man here's from Regensburg.
Here's a letter for the Captain.
The Captain is not here.
He'll be in this evening.
Ah, but the young man is very weary.
Can't we find a place for him till then?
Not in the house, perhaps in the barn.
- Horsey!
- Right, with the horses on the straw.
There he can give the letter to the Captain.
Horsey.
- Is that him?
- Yes.
We've tried everything we could to wake him, without success.
Have you ever seen him before?
No, never.
Here's the letter.
He didn't want to let go of it.
From the Bavarian border, no place name, dated 1828...
"His Excellency the Captain."
Does it say "His Excellency"?
It does, yes!
"I'm senden yr Grace a bouye..."
"Senden yr Grace," ha-ha!
- Should I take that down?
- Yes, please do.
"This here bouye wants to serve his King faithfully."
"The bouye was laid me on..."
He says the boy was "laid" him on 7th October, 1812.
"I am a poor labourer with ten children...
"and have enough to do to feed myself and my wife.
"His mother wanted to raise the boy, but I couldn't ask her to.
"I didn't tell her the boy was laid on me by the Court
"I have not let him take one step out of the house since 1812...
"so nobody doesn't know a thing about him.
"You can ask him, but he can't tell you.
"I teached him reading and writing, and he says he wants to be...
"a gallant rider like his father."
A gallant rider, yes.
"..A gallant rider like his father was before him.
"If he had parents he would have been a smart fellow."
A smart fellow, yes.
"You only have to show him something and he can do it.
"But please do not plie him with questions..."
Ply, with "ie"...
"He don't know where I am.
"Brought him away by night.
I am not signing my name."
No, there's no signature.
- Did you get it all down?
- Yes.
- This is very odd.
- Yes, indeed!
Should I report no signature?
Yes, and put this in the file.
I'll try him again...
No, don't. Leave him be.
You can see it's no use.
He seems to be not quite all right in the head.
- He's coming round...
- Your name!
Should I report that he refuses to talk?
Yes, name unknown.
Where are you from?
- And his passport?
- Gallant rider...
Occupation? Where were you born?
He says he comes from Regensburg.
From Regensburg.
The intelligence of this man is in a state of absolute confusion.
There's nothing to be gained by police interrogation.
Should I take that down?
Nothing to be gained by police interrogation, yes.
- Refuses to answer.
- He refuses to answer!
- Right, and what do we do now?
- Maybe he's hungry?
It's worth a try.
- Lay him down again!
- Spits out food!
Spat out food...
Let's have a look at his feet.
I say, those are old boots.
Those boots have very old toes!
Bleeding of the toes, scabs...
Indicates a long period of...
Feet extremely tender...
Both feet show the same indications of extreme tenderness.
- Aha, vaccination marks!
- Vaccination marks.
The foundling seems to be of the higher orders!
Foundling?
Foundling, yes, get that down.
Upper arm injured...
- What was this injury caused by?
- Upper arm.
- By a blunt instrument, I'd say.
- Blunt instrument, I'd say.
The same marks here, and here...
Put that down!
A Prayer book!
Entitled Spiritual Forget-me-nots.
"Beautiful and Devoted
Morning Prayers for Faithful Souls."
The other book...
A printed treatise entitled
Six Deep And Devotional Prayers.
Put it under "other things"...
A four-cornered, folded square of paper, containing...
Yes, a small quantity of gold dust, or gold leaf.
Put that with the other things.
Then a rosary... rosary.
A rosary with a metal cross.
With the other things.
Under the circumstances, this man should be taken into custody!
Put that down, word for word.
- A pencil!
- And a sheet of paper.
Can he write? Can you write?
Kaspar Hauser.
The fellow is not as wild as I thought.
He came peacefully.
He seems harmless enough.
I've done all I can.
The rest is up to the authorities.
Maybe we should place him under oath.
He did not impress us as being either mad or depraved.
Neither mad nor depraved.
It's best we keep him in this tower for criminals and vagabonds.
He doesn't look like going berserk.
No, but you never can tell.
He'll have to sit up to eat, he can't eat on the floor.
Julius, take his feet.
You hold him back... now forwards...
Now he's on his feet!
Sit him down there.
Let's stretch his feet out.
I guess he never sat up straight at a table before!
He never sat up at all in the tower.
Take the bowl away...
Hold on to the table there!
Come on, let go!
Give me your hat, you won't be needing it now.
Leave him be, it's all right.
Let's start
You've got to eat, come on.
You can't eat with your hat!
He won't give it to me.
There, take the spoon... and stem eating.
Look... look... like this.
Do it like me.
He'll be all right, it's just that he don't have no manners yet.
So, open your mouth...
See, I told you so!
Oh, my goodness me!
Take his bowl away, he's not used to it.
Give him bread, he always takes bread when you give it to him.
Bread... take the bread.
Give him a drop of water, Julius.
Look, it's empty, there's nothing more inside.
Nothing comes out any more.
. Empty!
- Empty-
- Empty!
- Nothing more inside.
- All gone. Empty.
- Empty.
Empty-
No, this jug's not empty, there's beer in it.
Look, it's full, it's not empty.
That cup there is empty.
There's nothing in it.
Empty-
It'll take time, getting him used to such things.
Don't cry, don't cry.
Oh my, how my gut is painin' me!
Finger, thumb, arm...
This is your hand, this is your arm.
Arm...
Nose... mouth...
Look, this is your ear.
Look, I've even got a mirror!
This here is your ear.
My gut is killing me.
Finger... shoulder...
Arm.
No, that's your hand. This is your arm.
- Hand, hand!
- This is your arm.
Arm, arm, arm, arm...
Hand.
Hey, what kind of place is this here, anyway?
Damn your eyes, ain't there nothin' in this place to drink?
Stand up, Kaspar, stand up!
You don't have to be ashamed, we're alone here.
Only the clear Lord is watching, don't be afraid.
Mother, my skin is coming off!
Don't worry about it.
He hasn't had a bath in years.
Lap, lap, lap, I like this milk
Lap, lap, lap, as smooth as silk
Good morning, little cat so white
May I sit down by your side?
Good morning, little cat so white
- May I...
- May I...
Be nice to me, little girl so fair
Then you may sit down right there
Lap, lap, lap, I like this milk
Lap, lap, lap, as smooth as silk
Agnes, that rhyme is too long for him.
All he knows are separate words.
I just taught him separate words and he can't understand your rhyme yet.
It's no use, he doesn't even respond to a feigned thrust.
Doesn't respond to feigned thrust.
I don't think he's a hard-boiled swindler.
He's got absolutely no conception of danger!
No conception of danger.
It didn't even scare him.
How about trial by fire?
- Is that for the record?
- Yes.
He's not afraid of the flame.
Charmed to meet you!
Charmed, I'm sure!
Look at him gapin'!
He's never seen that before.
Look, look... look here!
Pick up the baby, Kaspar, go ahead.
Mother, I am so far away from everything.
I eat with my handses...
With your hands!
With my handses.
With your hands!
Have you heard anything?
A number of people have testified that the foundling ran away from a group of English circus equestrians.
- They were in the Oberpfalz area.
- What was that?
Other citizens say he is a member of the Baden dynasty... who was to be eliminated as most likely heir.
The Baden dynasty, however, is beyond all reproach.
Besides, there are better ways of getting rid of unwanted heirs...
I don't believe the story, in any case.
Just look at him... with his coarse, rustic features!
There's nothing refined about him at all.
She can't walk on two feet!
After all, he's beginning to be a burden on the community coffers.
He's costing us a pretty penny.
Perhaps he should begin contributing to his own upkeep somehow.
One could turn the public interest in him to good use.
Come right on up, ladies and gentlemen!
Parents, keep an eye on their children!
Now, before we present the Four Riddles of the Spheres... we have for you an entertaining intermezzo.
This wild bear, Kublai Khan, from farthest central Asia, came to us somewhere in Mongolia, where the Huns live.
With one sweep of his mighty paw, he can kill a bull!
But here in the temperate zones, dear children... he is as tame and cuddly as a little cat.
Here is our Indian fire-eater, our fakir a living flame, a veritable mountain of fire!
He has succeeded, ladies and gentlemen, by willpower alone, in rejecting every trace of a burn or scorch!
Show us your skin, soft as a baby's, not a blemish.
What's this, you Scoundrel?
And now, ladies and gentlemen... for the very first time in the history of the world, brought together for you and only for the first time,
The Four Riddles of the Spheres!
Minors, please keep your distance!
The gravity of my presentation permits of no childish pranks.
And now for the first Riddle,
The Little King!
Monarch of the Golden Land of Punt of song and legend.
The last link in an ancient line of giants!
Each king of this line was tinier than the last.
Here you see the last living member of the royal family.
Another few centuries, and the Kings of Punt will be invisible.
The very last king will be no bigger than a flea!
Yes, there he sits, our Little King, cowering like an outcast in the corner of his throne.
And as the kings have grown tinier, so have their kingdoms.
His kingdom is no larger than the spot he is sitting on, for neither can he leave his kingdom without outside help, nor can he climb it.
Our next Riddle, ladies and gentlemen...
Our next Riddle of Science - the Young Mozart!
One day, long ago, he fell into a deep trance, and asked for nothing more but the music of Mozart
At a tender age he already knew all the scores by head.
Now, still in the trance, he looks for dark holes in the earth, because they tried to teach him to read and write at school.
Since that day he has lost the power of speech.
He was not able to read or write, he says, because the whiteness of the paper blinded him.
Day in, day out, he peers into dark, deep holes in the earth, looking for entrances to caves and underground waterways.
As you see, there is no way to gain the poor fellow's attention.
His mind is completely engrossed in zones of twilight.
Our next Riddle, a living specimen of anthropology... is Hombrecito.
An untamed Indian from the sunny shores of New Spain.
This wild man is the sole remaining member in all of Europe of the renowned and legendary Kaffir and Indian Show.
He plays his wooden flute night and day, because he believes that if he stops, all the people in town will die.
He wears three separate jackets to keep from catching cold and to protect himself from the evil breath of mankind.
Hombrecito is a jolly good fellow, and quite tame.
He speaks hardly a word of any tongue - except Indian, of course.
And now to the final and greatest Riddle of all!
Kaspar, the Foundling!
He has agreed, with the express permission of the authorities, to appear in person here every afternoon, and thus, to ease the community's financial burden.
Thank you, Kaspar!
Kaspar Hauser was found in the Town Square of this fine city just as you see him standing before you today.
In his right hand, a prayer book, and in his left, the Anonymous Letter.
Abandoned to his fate in a strange town, the boy could neither speak nor walk.
He had never seen a living being in his life before!
His origins remain in darkness to this day, ladies and gentlemen.
Is he a prince?
Or possibly, the legitimate son of Napoleon?
He is and will remain the Riddle of the European Continent!
Stop, Hombrecito!
Kaspar, come back! Are you mad?
I will get you!
Stop, in the name of the Law!
There he is!
Come down from there!
Stop shaking that branch!
If that branch breaks, I'll...
Come down here!
Keep searching for Kaspar.
The beehive! Ah, it's locked.
He couldn't be in there.
I want to fly like a rider... midst the bloody tussle of war!
What a fine, what a beautiful report this will make!
I shall write a report the likes of which has never been seen!
Kaspar, what's wrong? Are you feeling well?
It feels strong in my head.
The music feels strong in my head.
I feel so unexpectedly old.
You've been such a shod time in the world, Kaspar.
Why is everything so hard for me?
Why can't I play the piano like I can breathe?
In the two shod years you have been here with me, you have learned so much!
The people here want to help you make up for lost time.
The people are like wolves to me!
No, you mustn't say that.
Look at Florian, he lives here too.
He lost his family in a fire, he is blind, but does he complain?
No, he plays the piano the whole daylong, even though his music sounds a little strange.
Oh, how high it is!
A very big man must have built it.
I would like to meet him.
A man doesn't have to be as tall as the tower he builds.
He can use a scaffold!
I'll take you to see a new building.
You lived in this tower, where that little window is.
That cannot be!
Because the room is only a few steps big.
I don't understand.
Wherever I look in the room, to the right, to the left, forwards and backwards, there's only the room.
But when I look on the tower...
- At the tower!
- ..and I turn around, the tower is gone!
So, the room is bigger than the tower!
No, Kaspar, that's not right.
Think about it a little more.
I still don't understand.
How do you mean that?
Yes, let's ask him. It's important.
Another cup of coffee, Pastor.
Yes, please, it's excellent!
- Another cup of coffee?
- Yes, please.
You're not going to torture him much longer, are you?
I wouldn't call it torture!
- I'll leave the pot here.
- Thanks.
Kaspar, what we really want to know is, whether a Higher Being didn't occupy your thoughts in prison.
I don't understand the question.
In my prison I didn't think of anything and I cannot imagine that God created everything out of nothing like you say!
If he doesn't understand God, then he'll simply have to have faith!
You must have faith!
The tenets of faith transcend mortal doubt.
First I have to learn to read and write better to understand.
No, Kaspar, the articles of faith are more important...
And do stop pressing your thumb and finger when you speak!
And now, my son, please repeat this prayer after me.
Repeat after me!
For the peace of God is higher than all modal coils
Keep our heads in the name of Jesus Christ
Amen.
Please, repeat. Say it!
Look, these are last year's apples.
Big and red, aren't they?
And those apples on the tree will look just the same soon.
- How do they do that?
- Time does it, Kaspar.
And the Lord's plan!
Let the apples lie, they're tired and want to sleep.
Kaspar, an apple can't be tired.
Apples don't have lives of their own - they follow our will.
I'm going to roll one down the path, it'll stop where I want it to.
The apple didn't stop, it hid in the grass!
May I have your help in demonstrating it to him, Mr Fuhrmann?
Come here, Kaspar, watch!
Stand here where you can see.
Now, Mr Fuhrmann is going to put out his foot, and when I roll the apple, it will stop right where we want it to.
Smart apple! It jumped over his foot and ran away!
Smart apple!
What are women good for?
Can you tell me that, Katy?
Women are not good for anything but sitting still!
But Kaspar...
Why are women allowed only to knit and cook?
You'll have to ask
Mr Daumer that, Kaspar.
He'll know a decent answer for you.
I already asked Mr Daumer.
Yes, Mr Daumer is an educated man.
I will never learn as much as him.
He told me about the Sahara Desert and I can't get it out of my head!
Katy, have you been to the Sahara Desert?
I'm just a housekeeper,
I don't go journeying so much.
I was in Erlangen once, but it's a long way from there to the desert!
I know a story about the desert, but only the beginning.
Yes, Mr Daumer told me about it.
He said you couldn't get past the beginning of your story and that you should wait to tell it until you know the end and not just the beginning.
Yes, he takes it seriously, that you should learn to tell a story right.
If I... can ask...
Mr Daumer... to read... this letter... at his leisure.
A few days ago
I took some cress seeds... and sowed my name with them.
And it came up right pretty.
And it made me so happy,
I can hardly say it.
And yesterday, when I came back from boating, somebody had come into the garden, and stepped on my name.
I cried for a long time.
I am going to sow the name again.
It dreamed to me...
You had a dream? Tell it to me!
Yes, it dreamed to me.
You're really coming along, Kaspar.
You used to think all your dreams were real.
Just a fortnight ago, you said you saw the mayor's wife, even though everybody knew she'd gone on a journey.
Strange that you didn't dream once during your years in prison!
I dreamed of the Caucasus.
It just can't be true when you say that your bed is the only place in the world you're really happy in.
Don't you like the garden?
The gooseberry bushes?
Or the onions over there? All so green?
Well, it seems to me that my coming into this world was a terribly hard fall!
But, Kaspar! That...
No, that's not...
How should I explain it to you?
The professor here has come all this way to ask you a question.
He wants to see how well you can think and what you have learned in these two years and whether you can think logically.
Will you answer him?
- Yes!
- Good.
Kaspar... let's pretend that this is a village.
In this village live people who tell only the truth.
Here is another village.
The people here only tell lies.
Two paths run from these villages to where you are standing, and you are at the crossroads.
A man comes along, and you want to know which village he comes from, the village of the truth-tellers or the village of the liars.
Now in order to solve this problem, to solve it logically, you have one question, and only one.
What is the question?
That's too difficult for him, how can he know that?
I admit, the question is thorny.
If you ask the man whether he comes from the village of truth, and he does, then he will say, truthfully, yes.
But if he comes from the village of lies, he will lie, and also answer yes!
Yet there exists one question which will solve the problem.
That's much too hard, too complicated.
You have one question, Kaspar, and only one, to solve this problem of logic.
I wouldn't know either.
If you can't think of the question, then I shall tell you.
If you came from the other village, would you answer no if I were to ask you whether you came from the liars' village?
By means of a double negative, the liar is forced to tell the truth.
This construction forces him to reveal his identity, you see.
That's what I call logic via argument to the truth!
- Well, I know another question.
- You do?
There is no other question, by the laws of logic.
There isn't?
But I do know another question.
Let us hear it, then!
I should ask the man whether he was a tree frog.
The man from the truth village would say,
"No, I'm not a tree frog," because he tells the truth.
The man from the liars' village would say,
"Yes, I'm a tree frog," because he would tell a lie.
So I know where he comes from.
No, that's not a proper question.
That won't do, I can't accept it as a question.
That's not logic.
Logic is deduction, not description.
What you've done is describe something, not deduce it.
But I understood his question.
Understanding is secondary.
The reasoning is the thing.
In logic and mathematics we do not understand things...
We reason and deduce.
I cannot accept that question.
"Died June 30th, Karl Friedrich Wolf,
"apprentice bookbinder and orphaned son of Johannes Wolf,
"haberdasher and tradesman.
"Aged 18 years, nine months and 27 days.
"Cause of death, consumption.

"With gratitude we record the Guardianship Council's petition

"to ease the lot of the poor and destitute among us.
"Flowers will also be accepted."
No, Katy clear, my eyes aren't what they used to be.
Would you be so kind as to call on the tailor today?
Kaspar will be needing his new coat tomorrow.
How far along are you with your new biography, Kaspar?
The word is out that you are working on it, and everybody I know is dying to read it.
No, I don't want to let go of any of it yet.
There are so many words I don't know and so many things I don't understand yet.
Sorry to disturb you, but I just wanted to tell you that an English nobleman,
Count Stanhope, has come to town.
He has taken great interest in your situation, and said that he would like to adopt you if you made a good impression.
It would be a wonderful new start for you, Kaspar.
I am overwhelmed.
- Welcome!
- Thank you.
I should like to introduce my young protégé.
Kaspar, this is our charming hostess.
Don't be afraid. Give the lady your hand.
And this is our gracious host who will open the doors of society to you.
Allow me to introduce my young protégé to you.
Isn't he droll!
Quite the noble savage!
I should like you to meet the mayor and his wife.
Hello, Kaspar.
I'm so happy to meet you, Kaspar.
Tell me, what was it like in that dark cellar of yours?
Better than outside!
But we all like you so much, Kaspar.
Were you about to say something?
You needn't be scared of these people.
You just tell us whatever comes into your natural young head.
Your Grace, nothing lives in me except my life!
Oh, no, there's much more alive inside of you.
You've been making such fine progress with your music, something that educates and ennobles our feelings!
Your Grace, I would like to play a piece on the piano.
I shall play Mozart's waltz in F major.
I'm not feeling well, may I be excused?
A little fresh air will help.
I'll open the window a bit.
Are you feeling better, Kaspar?
I think it's better if we leave him alone for a moment.
There's no cause for concern.
Kaspar is feeling a bit faint.
Perhaps in the meantime,
I can tell you of my visit to Greece.
Not many days ago the sun of Hellas shone down on me.
I loitered, Pindar in hand,
'neath the columns of Corinth.
The sunrises were indescribable, the crystal clarity of the Greek light unforgettable.
A balm to the soul, that unsullied atmosphere!
I continued onto Crete, where I rode the little donkeys.
The backs of these animals are often quite hard, you know, and I was forced to wear peasants' trousers!
Then the festivals of the simple peasants of the countryside, the charming dances...
Excuse me, please. My protégé.
What's the meaning of this, Kaspar?
I'm sure I don't understand...
And what manner of silly business is this?
Apparently I've been guilty of a misjudgment.
There hasn't been enough time for me to get a true picture of the circumstances.
Why did you leave the church?
The singing of the congregation sounds to me like awful howling.
And when the singing stops, the pastor stems to howl.
Kaspar, we have to go back in.
Poor young fellow!
He must have taken too much of that laxative the doctor gave him!
- Katy!
- Yes.
Come here a moment.
It looks like a bloody handprint.
Mercy me!
I saw him go in here this morning.
And the door wasn't off its hinges.
Look, it's blood!
There are bloodstains on the cellar door.
He can't have broken in by himself.
He's drunk it dry!
Now he's bitten a piece out of the bowl!
Ah, here's our patient.
Hello, thank you.
Did you apply the bandage?
There wasn't time to do it better.
Were there any other injuries beside the head wound?
No, only his head.
I have a few important questions to ask the victim.
Please, not now.
Well, we won't be getting anything out of him today!
But at least he's not talking the kind of rot he did last week.
All the same, with respect to the crime and Hauser's origins, we can't expect much from him today.
Then I shall ask you to take your leave, gentlemen.
There was one thing...
I wanted to mention.
But it has nothing to do with the attack on me.
It is all so clear before my eyes.
Tell us, Kaspar.
I saw the ocean, and I saw a mountain and there were many people climbing up the mountain.
It was like a procession.
There was a lot of fog.
I couldn't see it very clearly, but at the very top was Death.
What's happened? He's been stabbed!
What happened? And where?
The man told me to watch the gardener, then he gave me this pouch and stabbed me.
I'll take you home, we'll carry you.
Let me see what's in the pouch.
A note!
"Hauser can tell you exactly what I look like
"and where I come from.
"To save him the trouble,
"I'll tell you myself where I come from
"and even what my name is.
"M. L.O."
The Lord have mercy on me, for I am weak.
Heal me, Lord, for my limbs are stricken.
Lord, why do you hide from me in my hour of need?
Do not go far from me, for fear is near.
I am weary of sighing.
I lie in the sweat of my body and my tears moisten my bed.
My body, weakened by mourning, has grown old and I am tormented from every side.
Away from me, evildoers, for the Lord hears my call.
Kaspar, my son, if anything is burdening you, please tell us now.
Yes.
There is something, a story.
It's about a caravan and the desert
But I know only the beginning.
That doesn't matter now.
Tell us the story, even if it's only the beginning.
I see a caravan... coming through the desert... across the sands.
And this caravan... is led by an old Berber tribesman.
And this old man is blind.
Now the caravan stops because some believe they are lost and because they see mountains ahead of them.
They look at their compass, but it's no use.
Then their blind leader picks up a handful of sand and tastes it, as though it were food.
"My sons," the blind man says,
"You are wrong.
"Those are not mountains you see.
"It is only your imagination.
"We must continue northwards."
And they follow the old man's advice and finally reach the City in the North.
And that's where the story begins.
But how the story goes after they reach the city, I don't know.
Thank you all for listening to me.
I'm tired now.
There we have it.
The left lobe of the liver is greatly enlarged.
That is an unusual finding indeed, and worth recording.
Please take this down.
Left liver lobe enlarged and extends...
Enlarged, yes.
...and extends to below the left arch of the diaphragm.
Doctor, look!
...arch of the diaphragm.
Look at the brain.
Its shape is rather unusual.
Yes, a remarkable abnormality.
Overdevelopment of the cerebrum.
Oh, I agree, yes!
There is also a deformity of the cerebrum.
The left hemisphere is too small.
That explains a great deal!
This should be recorded.
Take this down. Abnormal cerebrum, definitely overdeveloped.
Deformity of left cerebral hemisphere which does not sufficiently cover the cerebellum.
Coachman!
Today is a day to remember.
Be so good as to take my hat home with you.
I'm going to walk home.
What a wonderful, what a precise report this will make!
Deformities discovered in Kaspar Hauser's brain and liver!
Finally we have got an explanation for this strange man, and no one would ever find anything like this.
François!
Francesco!
François?
François. François.
He's ill!
What's happened to you? Speak to me.
He's come back from the war because he's ill.
He's not a coward! He...
- My dear son.
- Come on!
Come, come.
Francesco, please!
Come on!
We've been riding all night, too.
- All night?
- Yeah, on a girl, not on a horse.
And tomorrow, we'll be riding to battle.
We must be mad.
Is it true if we win the battle, we get all the girls we want?
Of course!
That's what wars are made for.
Kill the enemy and get the ladies!
It's getting late.
Let's go home and prepare.
Wars are serious business.
Such profundity, Bernardo.
Why?
Why?
Bernardo.
What a pity.
It's over.
Yes. It's a pity... but I hope we'll live to see another dawn like this.
The last night of our youth.
Do you realize that?
We tried so desperately to make it never end.
We should've stopped the sun from rising.
Come on, Francesco!
Wait!
Leave me alone.
Please.
Brothers!
Brothers!
Lepers.
Yes. Lepers.
No!
I don't want to feed them!
Get them off!
No, no, no, no, no...
No, no, no, no, no!
Oh... you're not dressed yet?
What have you been doing up until now, eh?
Pica. Pica!
Will you please stop all this sissified nonsense?
The boy's going off to war.
Besides, I don't understand a damned word.
Why do you two always want to leave me out of everything?
Don't speak French when I'm around.
How many times...
If you wanted a wife who speaks like you, why didn't you marry some thick-headed butcher's daughter?
Bravo, François, bravo.
Forgive me, Father.
Forgive me, Father.
Hey, wait, we must talk.
What shall we do with all the money we'll make out of this war?
Have you thought of that?
Ah... I see.
A true son of his father, eh, Pica?
We are going to be late for mass, Monsignor.
Ah, they'll wait.
Listen, Francesco... out of the way, out of the way.
Francesco, w-when you're in Perugia, don't forget Ugoni's storerooms behind the marketplace, near the main tower.
He's as rich as the pope.
There's everything there.
Yes, yes, leave it to me.
Ooh, and Francesco.
What else?
Remember the triptych I told you about for the cathedral?
It'll save us a fortune in indulgences.
Yes.
Yes, war is beautiful.
This is my death mask.
Go forth, sons of Assisi.
God is with you!
Francesco!
Francesco!
Francesco!
Flowers in the meadow softly sway
And all the little birds sing merry May Day
Rabbits in the orchard sport and play
And all the little creatures smile and are gay
My little boy, sing out your joy
I am near, my dear
My darling, do not fear
Love is all around you
Comforting with gentle lullaby to make your heart sing.
What's he doing up there?
Oh, that's Bernardone's son.
Francesco!
Get down.
Francesco!
Francesco!
Francesco.
Francesco, what is it?
Francesco, my sweet, Francesco, what's happening to you, eh?
You can tell me.
We've always understood each other.
We...
We've always been close, you and...
Let me help you, my darling.
Well, sit down, sit down.
Take a drink.
Yes, business is booming.
Life's back to normal at last.
Yeah, talking about business,
I have some fine stuff to show you that you won't find anywhere but here.
Well, not anymore, that is.
Look at this tapestry.
It comes from Provence.
That's beautiful, isn't it?
Feel the texture of this material.
Now, I'd like you to compare this with one from Venice.
Ah! This one here.
Look at your hands.
Look at your hands!
Forgive me.
If I find one finger mark on any of my silks,
I'll beat you till you're black and blue, you dirty little pig!
Ah!
These servants are just like animals.
How's your son? Better now?
Oh, yes, thank God.
He's cost me a fortune in masses to our blessed Mary, but the worst is over now.
Now, there we are.
Oh, he's begun to get up, and one of these Sundays, you'll see him with us at mass.
Yes, please, please.
Take it into the light.
Do you remember me?
I'm Clare.
People say you're mad.
Do you know that?
When you went off to war, they said you were fine and intelligent.
But now you're mad, because... because you sing like the birds, and you chase after butterflies, and... and you-you look at flowers.
I think you were mad before, not now.
Am I disturbing you?
I'll go...
You see?
He talks with her.
Thanks be to God.
That's obviously what was wrong with him.
The boy needed a woman, eh?
Oh.
You look at things so clumsily, Monsignor.
His heart is waking.
Well, you can call it what you like, but if you ask me, that lad's after a woman.
That's why he's been acting strangely.
What a lovely creature Clare is.
Hmm. Not much of a catch, though.
Her father won't even give enough dowry to pay for a wedding.
Still, if that's what
Francesco wants, we'll find enough money for both of them, hey, Pica?
And you know what?
Yes.
I'm going to put him to work again.
But...
No buts. You've mollycoddled him long enough.
- But, Monsignor...
- Shh, shh, shh.
Besides, Francesco's always been very good at business.
He likes it.
He does.
He takes after me.
Always has done.
Come, come.
You shall see.
I followed your advice,
Francesco, to the very letter.
I bought and bought and... and bought.
And now, we prosper.
Oh, I may curse the war for having given you this, uh, this fever, but-but for business, it was a blessing.
Come, come.
You shall see.
What you're going to see now will send the blood coursing through your veins.
Better than all those potions and medicines the women give you.
Eh?
Go, go.
Look at that, eh, Francesco?
Look.
You see this? See?
And to think people speak badly of war.
Come, come.
I'll show you.
You know how it started, eh, Francesco?
With the war supplies.
And then, after the war, the soldiers came to sell their loot.
And then the wights who'd been looted by the soldiers came selling whatever they had left in order to rebuild, practically giving away things for nothing.
I'll show you,
I'll show you.
Look at these.
Look.
Francesco, see these, huh?
Family heirlooms, hmm?
Titled people.
On their knees, they were.
Cost me less than nothing.
And this is not all.
It's just the beginning.
And there's so much more than that.
Now we have enough money to manufacture and sell with nearly 200 workers... dyers, weavers.
Well, see for yourself.
It belongs to you, too,
Francesco.
Don't forget that.
God bless the master of this house
And a lu-la-lu-la-lo
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay
Now milady, lady of
He be handsome, she be fair
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay
Bring them buttons and bells and bows...
A penny a rhyme will do me fine
And a lu-la-lu-la-lo
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay
Tuppence a rhyme,
I told you so...
God bless the master of this house
And a lu-la-lu-la-lo
And a lu-la-lu-la-lay...
Yes. Yes.
He invited them, if you please, out for a stroll, just like that.
He simply led them into the sunshine, and they sat there all afternoon.
Nobody did a stroke of work.
Oh.
And that-that... that simpleton, that-that idiot boy... he just... he just looked on.
He doesn't get it from me.
There's never been a history of insanity in my side of the family.
I've had enough of your high and mighty ways.
You're not in noble
Provence now, madam, and you'll not play the great lady in my house!
You've ruined that boy!
You've pampered him and spoiled him with your Frenchified airs and graces.
He's nothing more than a cringing idiot.
Something's got to be done, for God's sake, but not by you!
You are a stupid, thick-headed, vulgar animal, that's what you are.
Don't you understand what Francesco needs?
He's desperate.
Oh, Jesus, when I think of my own youth,
I feel like flaying him alive.
That's typical of you.
Treat him like... like one... like one of your clerks who comes to you whenever you stamp.
But, but, but Francesco's not like that, Monsignor.
- No?
- No, no.
And what's more, all the fathers and mothers of Assisi envy us such a son.
So... so sensitive, so intelligent.
Ah.
This is the, uh, envy of Assisi, huh?
Now you've gone far enough!
No, Monsignor.
No son of mine, do you understand, however mad, is gonna behave like this.
Have you no respect for me, huh?!
You will obey me in everything!
And if you do not,
I will crush you
- within an inch of your life!
- No!
Is that clear?
Is that understood?
And... And starting tomorrow morning, you'll come with us to mass, even if I have to drag you there like a dog!
Come on, sit up.
No!
No!
No...
No.
It's... It's mine!
This one.
All of it!
And this.
Out of the way!
Where is he?
Where is he?!
It will never make you happy!
Throw it all away!
Burn it, my brothers, all of it.
You...
But he doesn't realize what he's doing, Monsignor.
Be patient.
Father...
Father, I want to share my joy with you.
Our treasures are in Heaven, Father, not here on Earth.
Don't be a slave to these.
Throw it all away.
Do as I do.
It's so simple.
Be free.
Father... no...
No!
Oh! Stop it!
Stop it!
You lunatic!
No. No, my brothers.
Don't touch that.
Throw it into the gutter.
Throw it all away!
It will only make you miserable.
Look at my poor father.
Quiet, you idiot.
Call the guards.
See how he struggles.
I want to see him hang in the public square!
It's Pietro di Bernardone.
His son's gone mad.
What is all this commotion?
Di Bernardone's son, he's gone berserk.
Has he only found that out now?
Oh, anyway, you'd better alert the guards.
He's out of his mind.
What's the matter with you, Bernardone?
Have you gone mad as well?
I want justice, and I want it here, now, in front of all Assisi.
Well, it would be helpful to know the charge.
What has the justice of men to do with me?
God is my only judge.
Well, unfortunately, He isn't around to help us out.
Why not go to Bishop Guido, hmm?
Do you think I'm going to interrupt my meal because of some sordid family squabble?
What heresy.
Your Grace...
Oh, tell them I'm out.
Say I'm praying or something.
But the whole town is down there.
They insist that the church intervene.
It's becoming an outrageous scandal.
I really believe...
Guards!
I've only just got over Lent, and here you all are imposing another on me.
But, Your Grace...
Have it kept hot.
God's teeth!
Can a man not be left alone to dine in peace in his own home?
The bishop's coming.
Pietro di Bernardone, this will not do.
How dare you disturb us when we are in the middle of saying our office.
What's the matter with you, man?
Have you lost your senses?
It's not my fault, Your Grace.
It's him... that lunatic there.
Yes... it's me.
My soul is in your hands.
What?
Are you trying to cause trouble?
Is that what you're trying to do?
Is this some damned plot to rob the church of its authority?
That's nothing to what he's done to me, Your Grace.
I mean, God only knows,
I've always given him the best.
I, I, I brought him up.
I, I... I clothed him.
I...
I mean, you ask anyone.
They'll tell you.
He's never wanted for anything since the day he was born.
But today, he threw all my belongings out of the window!
And he even opened my strongbox!
Oh!
Thrown to a mob of cutthroats like himself down in the street.
Years of hard work and self-sacrifice just... just tossed away.
Then what is the answer to these accusations?
Surely you are sufficiently intelligent to understand that Holy Mother Church must punish those who subvert the established order.
A man such as you is a... is a menace to society.
He's either criminal or...
Or someone seeking the light.
Someone in darkness.
I was in darkness.
But Brother Sun illuminated my soul.
And now,
I can see so clearly.
Just as you did the day you chose the sacred vestments you are wearing now.
Are you seeking holy orders?
Me?
No. No.
I'm not worthy.
Then what do you want?
I want to be... to be happy.
I want to live like the birds in the sky.
I want to experience the freedom and the purity that they experience.
The rest is of no use to me.
No use.
Believe me.
If the purpose of life is this loveless toil we fill our days with, then it's not for me.
There must be something better.
There has to be.
Man is... is a spirit.
He has a soul.
And that, that is what
I want to recapture... my soul.
I want to live.
I want to live in the fields.
Stride over hills.
Climb trees, swim rivers.
I want to feel the firm grasp of the earth beneath my feet without shoes, without possessions.
Without those shadows we call our servants.
I want to be a beggar.
Yes.
Yes, a beggar.
Christ was a beggar, and his holy apostles were beggars.
I want to be as, as free as they are.
But, Your Grace, even beggars show respect for their fathers.
I'm not your son anymore.
What?
What is born of the flesh is flesh.
What is born of the Spirit is spirit.
I now... am born again.
Father, I give you back everything that belongs to you:
Your clothes... your possessions.
Your name, too.
There are no more fathers.
There are no more sons.
And everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or fathers, or mothers, or children, or fields, for the sake of our heavenly Father will receive a hundred times more in the life to come.
Cover him.
Cover him up.
Hey, come and see!
Look at the crusader.
Bernardo di Quintavalle?
Welcome.
Welcome home.
As I am presenting the keys of the city to the emperor, it would hardly be very bright of me to present them from the rear, would it?
Besides, this is not a religious ceremony.
My dear governor,
Otto of Brunswick is going to Rome to be crowned emperor by His Holiness.
How can you possibly say this is not a religious ceremony?
God moves in mysterious ways, my dear secretary, and He has arranged, on this occasion, that I move forward.
Ah! This is... pure blasphemy!
What? Do you suggest you are in direct communication with the Word of God?!
Sylvestro.
Come here, Sylvestro.
Paolo.
Something really marvelous has happened.
Guess what.
What?
Bernardo's back.
Yes! He rode in through the gates half an hour ago.
He looks... fantastic.
Yes.
...and I will make the speech of welcome.
Let's not discuss it further.
Everyone will have his assigned place.
But, but you are here.
Mm-hmm.
Streets ahead of me.
He couldn't have arrived at a more appropriate time.
Let's meet tonight and celebrate.
Giocondo, you arrange it.
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.
Hey! Bernardo!
How do you like your chicken?
Leg? Or breast?
The only one of us that's stayed the same.
It's all show.
He's trying to go back to his youth.
Why else would he choose this place to celebrate your return from the crusade?
Crusades are nothing to sing about, I assure you.
Oh, come on, Bernardo, you're, you're famous.
You're a war hero.
I say, you must have slaughtered thousands of Muslims.
What?
How many, at a rough guess, would you say that you killed?
Too many.
Oh.
Where's Francesco?
Oh, uh...
He doesn't live in Assisi anymore, Bernardo.
I gathered that, but...
What's happening?
Where is Francesco?
Oh, you're not still talking about him, are you?
We told you, he's mad.
What do you mean, he's mad?
Don't take any notice of him, Bernardo.
He's pissed, as usual.
But Francesco isn't mad, is he, Paolo?
No.
He's not mad.
He's... He's changed.
He is mad.
A raving bloody lunatic.
Only a lunatic will believe that God Himself had come down from heaven to talk to him.
Right?
Listen, God has spoken to lots of people sometimes.
How interesting.
And I suppose you think that God personally decided that San Damiano should be the first church in His rebuilding program.
San Damiano...? Rebuil...?
Is that where he's living?
Well, y-yes, I, I suppose so.
Is he all right?
Surely... Surely to God one of you went along to-to see him, speak to him.
You must have done something.
Look, he...
He is our oldest...
...and dearest friend.
He might need our help, for God's sake.
Bernardo, listen to me, not Giocondo, he's drunk.
Francesco's not mad.
Maybe he's very sane indeed.
But you are a hero of the crusades.
You can't afford to have your name associated with his.
- What?!
- None of us can.
Francesco's been a great friend to us all, but... quite simply, we have nothing in common anymore.
Damn it! Oh!
Jeez...
I can't stand it! Help me! Help me!
God damn!
God damn!
It's wanting out, honey.
Push so we can see what's coming out of the pouch.
Head's out, almost.
God damn!
Oh, God.
Come on. Oh, come on.
- Don't worry, baby. I'll get somebody.
- Mama had the baby!
Come on, Josephine.
He wants two of us.
I can't. I'm busy. Get Agnes.
- Mama had the baby. It's a boy!
- A boy?
God damn! I lost my bet.
Listen, I've already paid for two.
I'm ready now.
Sure you are, sweetie, and we're gonna get someone nice.
Violet! 'Cause we're gonna have ourselves a time.
Go and fetch Agnes yonder, will you, baby?
Tell her to haul it up to the blue room.
We're gonna have ourselves a time.
It's a boy.
It's a boy.
Well, Violet, old girl, is it all over upstairs?
- A boy.
- A boy?
Does it really hurt to have a baby?
Violet, you asking the wrongest person, the very wrongest person in the world.
Come on and play that thing, Professor.
Well, I certainly will do that.
I'll play something for that pretty baby your mama just had, brung into this cruel, cruel world on a night like this against his will.
And today I have attained my 75th birthday, and I intend to celebrate.
I haven't had a woman in longer than I care to say.
You know, she doesn't have to be beautiful, just patient.
Well, how about Frieda?
- Well, how are you, Admiral?
- Well, hello, Nell.
You've been to the North Sea.
I sure have, and now
I'm on an extended leave of absence.
- Well, I'm...
- Gonna be here a long time.
Oh, you're my kind of man.
I like the way you move.
All I want to hear from you is that I'm handsome, virile, generous and kind.
What's the matter, Will?
Come on. Hush up.
You don't wanna wake everybody up.
Be quiet now.
Violet, what if you had woke him up?
He paid for all night, and you know what he's like.
- Well, Will woke me up.
- You're not supposed to wake me up.
I don't get to sleep late any more.
Where'd you get those earrings?
They're awful pretty.
Never mind where I got them.
He gave them to me.
Won them in a card game or something.
Then I won them from him. Don't!
He just pierced them for me last night.
That's how I won them.
It's a lucky thing I was drunk.
Will you give them to me when I grow up?
Are you out of your mind?
These are real emeralds.
Otherwise I never would have let him punch those ugly holes in my ears.
Get my coffee. I feel awful.
Ooka dooka soda cracker, does your father chew tobacco?
- Ooka...
- Violet!
Get me my cane.
Oh, God.
Oh, and get me my absinthe.
Where the hell is that black bitch with my coffee?
Best you handle that with care, Joe.
And you ought to leave off suckling that boy.
You're gonna turn him spoiled, just like you did with Violet.
Oh, I think she likes it, having big tits.
Antonia, Violet, get off that pony.
I got something to tell you.
I went to see Mama Mosebery last night.
I paid her $2 and she gave me some uncooked turtle heart to bring me luck for the lottery, and I saw it move!
- Where you going?
- I ain't here, you know, to entertain you.
I gots deliveries upstairs.
- Well, how'd it taste like?
- What taste like?
- The raw turtle's heart.
- What do you think it tasted like?
Come on, please. Tell me.
Well, I am the child of a snapping turtle, raised by alligators on panther's milk.
I'm a poisoned wolf from Bitter Creek, and tonight's my night to howl.
Pedlars use the back door.
- Four, five, six...
- A pedlar.
Violet, go sit down and finish your okra.
I'm not raising you so as your teeth will rot, you know.
What is this sheet doing here?
It doesn't belong to the house.
Six, seven, eight, nine...
Look what's coming.
...eleven, twelve...
Oh, hush up now. Come on, baby.
Hi. I'm Bellocq.
I'm looking for Madam Livingston.
Is she receiving callers?
Harry, get down here!
You may come in, Monsieur Bellocq.
Well, come in, then.
Good God, you're in the wrong place, Monsieur.
We're not in the business of buying.
Madam, perhaps you know my name.
I have photographed in the district many times.
Am I addressing Madam Livingston?
Yes, you are, Monsieur, and you are too early.
My girls are all asleep.
They work late, you know.
It's 10:00 in the morning, Monsieur.
I require the light from the sun.
Now is the best time for me.
This young lady there, she would be fine.
I run a good, old-fashioned whorehouse, Monsieur, and you seem a little rabbity to me.
Photographs?
What the hell kind of thing is that?
I don't cater to no inverts.
If you're looking for something different,
I can assure you, you can find it right down here in New Orleans.
Madam, please don't tell me about New Orleans.
I have lived here all my life.
I apologise, Monsieur.
You realise
I'm willing to pay for her time?
Violet, child, go get me that package that Red brought.
Would you care for an absinthe?
Madam, the light. I beg your pardon.
Oh, the light. I had quite forgotten.
Well, go and take our Hattie.
She's very good, you know.
She will do whatever you want.
Thank you, ma'am.
And go take care of that child for her.
Want me to take my clothes off now?
- No. No. I'm liking you just as you are.
- You want me like this?
- Uncombed? I'm not even washed.
- Yes, yes.
I don't like that face.
It ain't a pleasant face.
- Now, this is a pleasant face.
- Quiet!
- I must have quiet now.
- Go away, Violet.
No. It's only she mustrt talk to you.
She's very beautiful.
She looks very like you.
Yes. Everybody notices it.
She's my sister.
Mother, I ain't.
My face is very like my mother's, but I got a fat stomach, just like all my fathers.
Where the hell is that goddamn whore's ass?
Hattie!
Hattie!
Maybe he's a voodoo man,
'cause he gots them bottles and stuff.
No. He's just another dumb john.
Jesus God, woman, get up and get me something.
My head is killing me.
I need something.
Laudanum, something. Jesus Christ!
My mama's having her likeness made, and it's all paid for, so there!
Why, hell, man, she's only good for one thing.
Why would anybody want to take a picture of a piece of ass?
Excuse me.
I will have to ask you to move away.
She must remain absolutely still.
Come on, honey pie, now.
Go along now.
You're still just a little bit drunk.
Where the hell did you get those earrings?
What?
Give me those emeralds, you skull-cracking, cotton-brained whore!
You gave them to me last night!
Well, why would I give real emeralds to a whore?
God damn you!
You bet me I wouldn't let you put those holes in my ears and I did, so those are mine!
I won them!
- They're mine!
- Oh, my sweet little piece of ass.
I remember now, Hattie. I remember.
Go to the bed and take off your stocking, child.
Mama Mosebery, I've got this hair growing around my nipples, and I'm tired of plucking it.
You must pluck them on Good Friday.
Bury them that same day and they'll never grow back.
Another new frock from Paris?
It's too early for a piece of tail.
It must be the bill collector.
Violet, you gonna be a lucky little one.
You gonna have so many men, you won't know what to do with them.
No, no, please.
If she's busy, I'll come back later.
No, no, please.
I'd rather wait downstairs.
Come on. Come on. Look who I found skulking in the hallway.
He say he's a photographist.
Hey, voodoo man,
I just got my fortune told. See?
No, no, no, no, no.
He says he have got something for Hattie, but he won't show it to me.
Hattie, you've got a gentleman friend.
Oh, excuse me.
I didn't mean to disturb you, ladies. I...
I have something for Miss Hattie.
She's in the bathtub.
She's always in the bathtub.
Oh, she is indisposed.
I would rather come...
- What's that?
- No, no, no.
I'd rather leave this off for Miss Hattie.
Don't give me that. You is a sport.
Hey! Let me see your camera!
Please stop! Stop!
Please don't do that. Stop! Please.
- Be careful.
- Oh, she's so pretty!
- Christ be, she looks like an angel.
- And everybody knows that ain't so.
Sure wish I had a picture like that of myself.
Yeah, I could send one home to my folks.
- How'd you do that?
- This is nice.
Magic, and I only need one second.
Well,, y pretty baby
Wort you co, e on over here?
Let your sweet papa whisper in your ear
Well, I', wild about the jelly roll
Sweet jelly roll of, ine
Cheat is right. You cheated me!
Well, there's my cards, queens and aces. Let's see yours.
- Right here.
- What I got to do?
I got my hand right here!
What the hell is it?
- He is cheating.
- Let me go!
I got three aces.
I don't know what you've got there.
You're drunk, man. Get out of my place!
Your place?
To hell with you and your kind!
And don't you know,, ada, e, that you are as common as whale piss?
That you are as common as whale piss?
Highpockets!
Oh, what have you done to... Oh, God!
Where the hell is that bum Harry?
- My God, you've killed him.
- Well, I hope so.
Hattie, you must take the bitters with the sweets.
Claude, go back to your piano.
Violet, go make me a pipe.
I can't take all this emotionalizing.
Harry, get in here and throw him out.
You can't throw him out.
He'll come back and kill me!
Well, look what that goddamn son of a bitch did to my place.
- Well, you just can't leave him to die.
- Well, you just watch me.
Harry, go through his pockets and take everything he's got.
- He only has about $100.
- Take it all.
Drop him on Emma Johnsors doorstep.
No!
Go on, then.
Pack up your bags and go with him.
And get rid of that hammer that accidentally dropped on him.
We don't do no carpentry work in here, so we don't need no hammers.
Hattie, you know Nell didn't mean that.
Something must have went wrong when your ma was carrying you in her pouch.
Yeah, something went wrong.
My mama was a whore.
She had me in a house just like this, and now I'm a whore.
I don't know anything except a man lying on top of me, scared to death
I'm gonna get the little casino.
Oh, here we go again.
You think you're the only whore in New Orleans scared of getting sick?
Oh, you just go ahead and laugh.
You're gonna end up peddling gas for a thumbnail of cocaine.
I'll send for my trunk.
Everybody has a right to do what they want.
- I wanna be a respectable person.
- With a gambler?
It's those respectable people who are lying on top of you every night, Hattie.
You'll be back.
No, I won't!
I'm here for one purpose, and that's to live my life to the hilt and enjoy it the same way.
Come on, Violet.
Why aren't you packed?
I don't wanna go.
Violet, I am your mother.
No, you're not.
You even say so all the time.
Violet, why are you acting this way?
What ails you?
Violet?
Violet, I'm talking to you!
Oh, God, I have a splitting headache.
I'm gonna stay here.
I hate you.
If it werert for you, I would've been out of here a long time ago.
Oh, you're so selfish. It just isn't fair!
Why does everybody else get to do everything they wanna do around here except me?
Just when I get a chance to do something for myself!
Sometimes I wish I'd never been born.
This is Josephine, who just loves young boys. Don't you, girl?
Hi.
Actually, my real name's Hildegarde.
My friends all call me Hildegarde.
- You from Tulane?
- Oh, yeah.
That's very brave.
You two ladies are gonna change my luck.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Yes, I certainly do.
And the other girls? Do you like them?
Well, yes.
Then why do you sit here night after night?
Why don't you go upstairs with any of us?
That is for me to know and for you to find out.
You're very old, aren't you?
Yes, very old.
- Very, very old?
- Yes. Very, very old.
Do you think you'll be dead soon?
- No, I don't think so.
- Well, why don't you think so?
Well, I don't feel like being dead yet.
I'm too young.
You said you're old, so how can you be too young?
Gotta wet my whistle.
- Well, I think you'll be dead soon.
- Oh? Why?
Because Madam Nell said so.
She said you'd be better off dead.
Oh. Better off dead?
Madam says there's something wrong with you, that you're some kind of cream puff or something.
She thinks that you're pathetic, missing all the fun in life.
Perhaps Madam Nell is imagining she knows more than she does.
- You think she's having fun?
- She's as happy as anybody.
Are you afraid you'll get little casino?
- The clap?
- Oh. No.
- Well, why, then?
- Do I ask you questions?
- I don't have to explain myself to a child.
- I'm not a child.
Excuse me, that is your opinion.
Leave me alone.
You hate me.
I have no time for hate or love.
Dear child, you're so full of life.
You don't have to take mine, do you?
Well, what have we here?
Are you selling little girls now,
Madam Nell?
White slavery, huh?
- Hey, do you know how to kiss?
- Of course I do. Everybody does.
Well, you watch out for him, Violet.
He's got a heart like an artichoke, a leaf for every girl, and a prick on the end of each one of them.
Now, tell me, where did you get those pretty, pearly teeth and that beautiful brown hair?
My mama puts my teeth in every morning with a crochet hook, and I chose brown hair
'cause it don't show the dirt.
No. No, no. No, no.
That's not my style, you know.
I was just kidding around.
What'll you give me for a message?
I'll give you the back of my hand, is what I'll give you.
Is there someone down there for me?
It's that horrible old coot again.
Do not be so snotty about him.
That old fool's idea that he likes me is my ticket out of this place.
And besides, he is rich.
I know because I looked him up in the phone book, and he lives on St Charles.
And he could have whatever he wants in the world, and he wants me, who doesn't give a damn for him.
"Me, who doesn't give a damn for him."
This is my little girl, Violet.
- How old are you, Violet?
- I don't know.
- Do you like her?
- She is very pretty.
Like Nell said, she's only for French.
She's still a virgin.
Well, I have it now. You may relax.
I feel like I'm gonna croak.
Violet, honey, go get us a drink.
Before the war, we used to close down in the summertime, but since the naval base came, we're busy all year round now.
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, thank you.
Perhaps we could make another one now. Would you like to?
Yeah. Why not?
My breasts are very nice.
They're nicer than any of the other girls'.
Do you think maybe I should just show them a little bit?
Yes, that would be better. Let me see.
Well?
You have fine skin.
- Do you have any white powder?
- Sure, cheri. Right over there.
Put it on your shoulders here.
Yes, and on your breast.
I love the one you made of Fanny naked.
She sure is fat.
Fanny's beautiful, but I wasrt pleased with the light.
So you all ready for me now?
Are you content?
- Child, I'm afraid you'll have to go now.
- Me?
Lie back against... Put your head here.
Yes. Can you lay on your side?
That's it.
And put your hand behind your head.
That's it. That's perfect.
Don't move. Don't move at all.
You look very beautiful.
Just beautiful.
I'm very happy just now.
Just a few seconds, and it will all be there perfectly.
Now, don't move.
That one should be very nice.
Now, don't move.
Never, never do that!
You have no idea what you might have done!
I only wanted to see the picture.
I didn't do anything!
Violet.
You have to wait.
This is only a negative.
It has to be developed and printed and...
And then...
You love her!
Don't tell me how I feel.
Now, Violet,
I'm very sorry, but you might have ruined a whole day's work for me, so you should be sorry, too.
Don't tell me how I feel.
I know about you. You love her.
Leave her be. She's just showing off.
Come on. Let's go down and eat.
I like that one better.
Two? You're trying to rob a poor working girl.
I'll give you 25 cents, no more.
Three each. I'll sell it to you for a dollar.
A dollar? I got the same blouse on Canal Street for 50 cents.
'Course, I likes my women with a little more on the top and bottom.
Stop being so cheeky with me, or I'll get my voodoo woman to put grigri all over your piano.
Violet, come on down here and let me see the front of that dress.
Oh, Violet, that ain't much of a dress.
When you're going to bust your cherry, you best wear red satin.
That's why you a dumb nigger,
'cause you think like that.
She's a virgin. Do you want her to be dressed like a picayune whore?
My God, Frieda, you're as green as a goose turd.
- What's this?
- Open it and see.
It's the ninth bone from the tail of a black cat, guaranteed to bring you luck tonight.
Red Top!
Do not forget that this guy is buying a virgin, so she's got to act it right.
You've got to give him the idea that you don't know nothing.
It should be like a rape.
You don't know.
Could be a different kind of guy, someone that wants you to act like she wants it.
The main thing is to whimper and cry at first when he starts, but then you've got to act like it feels good.
I know what to do. Leave me alone.
Well, don't act like you know it all.
You won't even get a tip that way.
Violet, you should touch him there, you know, like it's accidental.
I know. I know all that.
Violet, you is a beautiful girl.
Now, all you need is that handsome dress and plenty diamonds to elaborate the condition.
That was good.
You'd better enjoy it.
It's the last fine dinner you'll get on me.
- Oh, hell, no!
- Oh, no, no, no!
Isn't that so, Senator?
The navy's gonna close the district down.
Well, I can't fight the United States Navy.
We tried that already, and we lost.
Sit down, Violet. It's easier.
Honey, you want me to help you put your powder on or anything?
- No, I can do it myself.
- All right.
God, I could remember when she was born, and now she's busting her cherry.
Jesus, Fanny, you were only six years old when she was born.
Well, my, my, aren't you handsome?
Why haven't you been here before?
You're just my kind of man.
Oh, look at that.
Where you been hiding that thing?
How long has it been for you, cheri?
Lie down right here. Give it to me, baby.
A virgin, bona fide.
- How old is she?
- Do you wanna put me in jail?
She's just old enough.
The finest delicacy
New Orleans has to offer, and it's her wish that one of you gentlemen be the first.
If you'll all join me in the parlour, you'll get your opportunity.
Come on. Quick.
Come on.
Give me the ribbon, child.
Come on.
What am I bid, gentlemen?
Don't we get a look before we buy?
Kid, you can look all you want.
Just don't break the merchandise.
Hey, how do we know she is a virgin?
Have I ever lied to you before?
Satisfaction guaranteed.
Well, gentlemen, I'm getting impatient.
- I'll bid $100.
- Yeah!
I'm bidding $120.
- Oh!
It's too late, Senator.
That's beautiful, Senator. Just beautiful.
Remember, gentlemen, she's as fresh as a baby's lips.
Oh, they're getting out of my range.
- This is gonna be too much.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, $210.
I'll top that with $225.
Well, I'll bid $230.
- All right, $240.
$275, madam.
- Where did he come from?
I don't know.
I haven't seen him around here before.
- I don't know, but he's got money.
Will you take a cheque?
What would I do with a cheque?
Cash. I got cash. $400.
Jesus Christ. Who is he, Rockefeller?
Hey, this is kind of out of our league.
We don't have that kind of money.
Look, this is our night.
You werert invited here.
- Who do you think you are?
- Why don't you go someplace else?
- Hey! Watch what you're doing!
- Hang on, fellas. Wait up, wait.
Sold to the man with $400 cash.
Do not give him any argument.
You want some whisky?
Well, Jesus,
I didn't mean the whole damn thing.
I'm glad it's you.
Why are you glad it's me?
Well, you look nice, and you have a nice chest.
I can feel the steam inside me right through my dress.
Let him have his young peach.
I like my fruit ripe.
Gives me queasy innards to see a thing like that.
- Isn't there a lock?
- Madam Nell don't allow no locks.
God damn.
For $400,
I'd like to have that door locked.
I hope you're gonna be real gentle on me, being my first time.
Want a whisky?
Please...
You wanna go for a little roll in the kip?
Are you sure you don't wanna go for a little roll in the kip?
Smells bad in here.
- You're feeling badly?
- Oh, I feel fine.
I feel all right. I'm happy. I feel fine.
And I could probably accommodate personally every man at the house if I decided to.
Violet?
Jesus.
Madam!
Violet?
Get a doctor! She's been murdered!
Violet! Oh, my baby!
Violet?
Baby?
Well, I'd like to know where the hell you all been.
I've been lying here forever.
You don't care about me at all.
Oh, Violet, that really wasrt funny.
I know it's not funny. Am I laughing?
So you had a live one, huh?
Come on. That's what it's all about.
Maybe now you'll let us sleep in the mornings when we feel bad.
Yeah.
The war. Her father got killed, her mother forced to go to work.
You know, she's a virgin.
Well, I ain't too particular about the virgin part, but I hear tell there's disease.
I got no sick girls here, Monsieur.
Who told you about my place? A friend?
Yes'm.
Well, if you can't trust a friend...
Now, how about it?
Pure as the driven snow.
Can I have a little bit more of that wine?
Yes, sweet face.
- Thank you. You spoil me.
- Oh, I know.
Oh, my gosh. That took my breath away.
There are only two things to do on rainy days, and I don't like to play cards.
I propose a toast.
To a quick end to the war.
- Hear, hear.
- Ja. To the end of the war.
Catch it.
Get it.
Oh, wow.
- It's bad luck. It means death.
- Open the damn windows. It'll fly out.
No. It has to go out the same way it came in.
Oh, I'm gonna get that little bird.
Come down here. Come... You...
Ain't it pretty? It's so tiny.
Come on, honey. Don't be shy.
Now. Tell them for me now, please.
Well, I've asked Hattie to be my wife, and she has personally agreed, so we're gonna be married.
- Great. We're gonna have a wedding.
- When? 'Cause we are ready.
Well, actually, we're gonna get married in his hometown.
Yeah, you see, I got me this little house in St. Louis, Missouri, so I kind of thought we'd be married there.
Well, Hattie, you finally nailed one, huh?
Arert you gonna answer me, Violet?
I had to do it this way.
I wasrt even sure he really meant it until he come today.
But he's got the ring and everything.
It's gonna be really big things for us.
I told him that you was my sister.
He don't know any different.
As soon as the right time comes,
I'm gonna tell him.
It's lucky he doesn't even mind about little Will.
Want some?
Hattie, our train leaves in a half an hour.
All right, honey. I'm coming.
Honey, I'll send for you.
I promise you that.
Do I look all right?
- One card.
- One card.
Don't you fellas wanna do something?
It's our day off.
Well, we are doing something.
I tell you, you put men in a room with a bunch of whores and all they wanna do is play poker.
- I'll never understand men. Never.
- Really.
Well, we still have Papa.
Shall I take you all to the burlesque?
Or we could go to the picture show.
- I know. Let's play sardines.
- Yeah.
And Papa... Papa can be it.
I don't know this game, sardines.
- I never heard of it.
- You'll learn.
We made it up. It's really a lot of fun.
- It's kind of like hide-and-seek.
- Yeah.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
- Look under the bed.
- Oh, I see.
He's not in Agnes' room.
God damn it.
Did you find him?
Papa? I know you're in here.
I didn't look in Gussie's room.
Damn it.
You were easy. I heard you breathing.
Did you like that?
Hey.
He's been real bad. It's been hard to keep him quiet. Get in. Get in.
- Sardine.
- Caught you. Sardine.
Is he in there?
Papa ain't no cream puff.
All right.
It's just a trick.
She hates to be losing a game.
God, that sure was a fall.
It's not funny. I think I broke something.
You broke something, all right.
I love you once. I love you twice.
I love you more than beans and rice.
How about a little something for the Professor?
- What will become of her now?
- What's going on with you?
You don't have to worry about her.
She's made a lot of money.
She can do as she likes.
She's only 12. She's completely alone.
Bellocq, you're in love with her.
- Don't be absurd.
- I've seen it a hundred times.
I am old and life is so long.
Stop that goo-gooing.
Nine. Thank you. I have a nine.
You're quite welcome.
I knew you needed it.
Five. What did I roll?
- Eight.
- Eight.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I got an eight. I'm winning. Very good.
Five.
Nine.
I'm standing here thinking I'm ready to get my picture took.
- Violet, please go away.
- Go away, Violet.
I got a five.
I've won.
You're stupid and old.
Red Top, when you grow up and you have a beard and a moustache,
I'm gonna think you're very handsome, and I'm gonna love you up hard and long.
Well, especially me,
'cause I am the lover boy.
I bet neither of you never done nothing.
Huh? I had me a piece of tail yesterday.
All the girls in the district give me free loving.
Yeah.
- Nonny, you never did it, did you?
- 'Course I have. Lots of times.
Then tell me what it feels like.
Well, it feels good.
For God's sakes, what else?
Tell me exactly how it feels.
I knows how it feels, but I just don't know how to describe it.
It's like you get this tingling feeling along your back, and this funny feeling starts creeping up your toes.
- Do it, Nonny.
- What? You must be crazy.
- Do it to me right now. Prove you can.
- Who? Big you and little I?
Get over there.
I'm gonna make you my lover man, Nonny.
I'm gonna love you up real hard and long.
Let me up! Let me up!
- What you gonna say, boy?
- Nothing.
He ain't gonna say nothing.
Violet, baby, you is very bold, and the way you been raised, you don't know nothing about the real world.
White and coloured, they can't be together, as far as that's concerned.
I can do what I want.
Everybody does that with everybody.
And coloured?
Do you see coloured men upstairs for that?
No, you don't, Violet.
I'm a church-going woman that was married by a preacher, and what I can say is you have gots to leave my Nonny alone.
You pushing far, Violet.
She certainly is.
Harry!
Let me go!
Let me go!
No! Harry!
Let me go!
No!
You can't beat a child.
It only teaches her to beat others.
I'll run my business and you tend to yours, Papa.
It didn't hurt.
Hard-headed and hard-assed.
Hey, Papa, you sure you won't stay for dinner?
No. No, thank you.
- And how did you find me?
- I looked you up in the telephone book.
- Anybody can think of that.
- I don't have a telephone, Violet.
Well, I followed you here. Lots of times.
Have you had your supper?
- What's all this?
- I've been working.
You mean this is your work?
Photographing?
Yes. This is how I earn my living.
God, that's so easy.
Well, easier than working in a house.
You've decided to run away?
- Where do you sleep?
- Upstairs.
I wanna see it.
- Why do you lock it?
- I don't know. Habit.
Sometimes children break into my house.
Why?
I imagine they're curious about me and my camera.
- The neighbourhood has turned bad.
- Why?
"Why? Why? Why?" I don't know why.
'Cause of the whorehouses.
How come you got no electricity?
Well, I like this room.
Ooka dooka soda...
Well, you certainly did it, didn't you?
Violet?
Can I stay here?
Yes, you may, if you want to.
I do. Will you sleep with me and take care of me?
No.
And why not?
Because...
'Cause I'm not sure why exactly.
You're afraid of me.
Perhaps.
I want you to be my lover and buy me stockings and clothes and...
You don't know what you're saying,
Violet.
I won't even charge anything at all, and you can visit me at my house and be my fancy man.
I thought you were running away from the house.
Oh, yes. They can't beat me like that.
No, not me.
- I agree, absolutely.
- You do?
Otherwise, I should already have beaten you for breaking my bed.
- You hit me once.
- Yes, and I'm sorry.
You love my mother more than me.
I know about those things better than you.
You always know those things about men when you're a woman.
Some men are different.
I'm different.
Well, maybe not after all, because I'm all yours, Violet.
All mine?
Yes.
I love you once. I love you twice.
I love you more than beans and rice.
I'm gonna make you so happy.
You're just my kind of man.
You really are.
I'm really good, you know, cheri.
Don't talk to me like that, please.
Don't talk like a whore.
Then what do you want me to say?
I feel something inside me, so I say it, and when you go away, it hurts me right here.
You're only hungry, perhaps.
And what's wrong with whores, anyhow?
I thought you liked us.
Everybody says I'm pretty and getting to be filled out soon, and all the other men like me.
Don't you like me?
You left me all alone.
I left you a note.
Well, I can't read yet.
- I brought you a present.
- A present? Where?
Where is it?
She's beautiful.
Why did you buy me a doll?
- Every child should have a doll.
- I'm a child to you?
Violet.
Violet!
Violet!
Violet, what ails you?
What's the matter, Violet?
Violet, I'm talking to you!
I've got such a splitting headache.
You're so selfish, Violet.
It's just not fair.
Everybody gets to do what they want, except me.
Violet, did you take those bottles that I left on the table in the front room?
- The ones with the glass stoppers?
- Yes.
Yes. I was playing with them.
Well, what did you do with what was inside of them?
Well, I poured it out.
My God, Violet, that's silver nitrate.
I use it for my photographs.
- Whatever made you do such a thing?
- It smelled so bad.
Because of your thoughtlessness,
I have to go all the way uptown to replace those chemicals, and they're very expensive.
Why are you crying?
For joy and to amuse myself.
You wanna come with me?
No.
What are those?
- What are what?
- Those clothes.
Oh, these? These are pyjamas.
You aren't going to tell me you've never in your life seen pyjamas?
No john I ever saw wore anything like that.
I'm tired of lying here.
If you would have stayed quiet for one second more,
I would have had it.
It's always one second more with you.
And why do you wanna take my picture again and again?
I'm tired of having to deal with a child.
I don't have to stay here and listen to you yell at me.
Well, I'm leaving, and you won't have anyone to photograph any more.
So this is how you would repay me.
Repay you for what? For what?
I don't owe you anything at all.
Get out. Get out, Violet, before I kill you.
If you destroy any more of my pictures...
Who cares about your pictures?
Who buys them? No one.
Sinners.
Sinners!
These reeking pest holes are inabited by 1,500 angels of death and damnation.
Four hags, in palatial palaces of guilt, imperil the virtue of every innocent girl.
And what, dearly beloved, can we do about the weakness of lusting men and soft women?
Violet, where you been?
We better get out of here.
If they catch us, we'll go to the Home for Good Shepherds.
Brothers and sisters, unite.
Stupid puritans.
Nell says they're just horny men who come around to snoop.
Well, this time they're really gonna do it.
Mama Mosebery says everything will be closed down.
- So what if they do?
- I don't know.
- What'll become of me?
- You can be my fancy man.
She's gone mad.
I told you. Even Madam Nell.
The evil eye is on us all.
Look, circles of salt.
Somebody put a spell on you.
Ola Mae, take this holy water and wash the kitchen and Miss Nell's room.
In Rome, times like these, barbarians came. Oh, did they.
It goes on and on.
I heard the doorbell.
Where is everybody?
Death is keeping them away.
There are reasons for death, good reasons.
Oh, stop talking, would you? Stop it.
Excuse me.
Dirty roughnecks with their rotten manners.
Dirty roughnecks with their rotten manners.
We'll be at the station for an hour if you change your mind.
- Bye.
- Come on, children. Let's go.
Terrible piano anyhow.
Oh, you look so fine.
Violet, old gal, we'll go to Chicago.
Chicago is the money town.
We'll have ourselves a time there.
Take the northbound
New Orleans Central.
Hey.
Careful, now. It has a delicate frame.
Where are you going, Violet?
Where's that no-good mother of yours?
- I gots a postcard from her and a letter.
- With no return address, huh?
- Don't talk about her.
- Oh, you're breaking my heart.
Papa, what are you doing here?
I'm going to marry you.
Can I ask all the girls?
But Antonia and Justine is gone, and Odette and Josephine.
- Can we go get them?
- Of course.
Well, what'll I wear?
You can wear whatever your heart desires, just as long as you do it with me.
Her father unknown, and the mother deserted the child.
My mama's name was Hildegarde.
Hildegarde Marr. M-A-R-R.
- And she was Caucasian or other?
- She was a whore, Father.
Those whom God has united let no man put asunder.
You may kiss the bride.
Papa, there's a good spot over there.
No, no!
Turn around, Papa.
The other place was better.
Sit down.
Oh, God!
Well.
We'll just have to get out and push.
But I am wearing my new dress for Chicago.
We're all wearing our new dresses, you damn fool.
Well, let's get our damn clothes off and celebrate this thing.
I'm not getting out, and that's that.
Come on, Frieda!
- Pass me some more oysters.
- Anyone want some of the sauce?
Oh, yeah.
Try this, Odette.
- Papa, come eat.
- Yes, I'm coming.
Now, Papa, you didn't eat anything before.
Now eat.
Y'all gonna enjoy yourselves today.
How come one man got so many women?
He just got married today.
And guess who he married. Guess.
Well, it doesn't matter,
'cause he's the luckiest son of a bitch
I ever seen on a wedding day.
Why are you ringing?
You have everything you need.
I want some hot chocolate with brandy in it.
I feel poorly today.
Oh, I'm sorry. What is it this time?
You know.
Oh, yes. Of course. I forgot.
I'm gonna sleep all day today.
Well, how is that any different from the last two weeks?
Get me some cocoa.
And the bottle of brandy.
Do you...
I mean, did the girls teach you how to prevent yourself from becoming with child?
I mean, did you know you...
Don't tell me about that.
Don't tell me about the things I know.
Hard-headed berry don't make good soup.
That's what Ola Mae used to say about me.
I know.
- Violet.
- Mama?
Yes, it's Mama.
Oh, Violet. My baby. My darling.
Look at the way you've grown.
We have been looking everywhere for you.
Here we go.
It's okay.
I told him all about you, Violet, and he insisted that we come and get you.
You smell good, Mama.
We've got a big, beautiful house in St. Louis.
Mr Fuller, he's a pavement contractor.
You know, he's paved almost every street in St. Louis, and he wants you to come home with us.
But I live here.
I and Papa. Papa and I are married now.
Mrs Fuller,
I'm so glad to see you are doing so well, and little Will.
Mr Fuller and I want nothing to do with you, Mr Bellocq.
We had to go to some awful places to find out about you and my daughter.
Hattie, we're married now, so stop this.
It is not legal without my consent.
Mr Fuller's already seen to that.
You deserted the child.
I don't mean to be cruel...
How dare you say that?
I did no such thing!
Now, Mr Bellocq, be sensible.
Now, I wanna send Violet to school, and she has to be raised right.
Now, I know that in a lot of ways, we've got no right to get up on a high horse, but now Mrs Fuller has overcome her past, and she wants the same for Violet.
Well, you cannot take her!
I can't live without her.
That's all.
Papa, you can come with us.
Come on, Violet.
You don't need to pack.
We'll get you whatever you need on Canal Street while we're waiting for the train.
Can't we all go?
Are you ready?
Just a minute.
- There. Now, that's better.
- Now we're ready.
Move in closer.
Good. Now, let's get one more.
Okay.
Okay.
- What's the matter, honey?
- Is he okay?
Oh, he's fine.
Y'all want him to stand by?
Make sure you get Violet.
It's hard to remember now, but Europe was like this in 1944.
The Second World War was in its fifth year...
...and still going Hitler's way.
German troops controlled most of Europe.
D-Day changed all that.
D-Day: June 6, 1944...
...when the Allied forces, under their commander General Eisenhower...
...landed on the northern coast of France.
By July they were able to begin their own offensive.
By August, Paris was liberated.
Everywhere the Germans retreated.
But with the Allied victories came problems.
Supplies still had to be driven from Normandy, over 400 miles away...
...and became dangerously short.
The Allied advance began to come to a halt.
Another problem facing Eisenhower was this:
His two most famous generals...
Patton, who was in the south...
...and Montgomery in the north... disliked each other intensely.
The longstanding rivalry had never been more fierce.
There simply were not enough supplies for both armies.
Each wanted to be the one to defeat the Germans.
Each wanted to beat the other to Berlin.
In September, 1944...
Montgomery devised a new and spectacular plan...
...given the code name
"Market Garden."
Eisenhower, under great pressure from his superiors...
...finally sided with Montgomery...
...and Operation Market Garden became a reality.
The plan, like so many plans in so many wars before it...
...was meant to end the fighting by Christmas...
...and bring the boys back home.
What is that noise?
- Can I look out?
- No, they might shoot us.
The Germans have collapsed.
Then the war is over?
Soon.
But what is that noise?
Panic.
You may begin.
May I first be permitted to say, and I think I speak for all of us...
...how pleased we are,
Field Marshal Von Rundstedt...
...that you have been reappointed commander of our forces in the West.
Speeches are for victory celebrations.
Let's get to the point.
Air power?
Air power, Field Marshal?
Briefly, please.
- Air power is minimal.
- Ammunition?
Also minimal.
Tanks... Troops...
Replacements?
- Minimal.
- Morale?
Nonexistent.
What do you think we should do?
End the war, you fools.
- Why in the world are you laughing?
- Excuse us.
We have such confidence in you.
Everyone knows you have never lost a battle.
I'm still young.
Give me time.
The first thing we must do...
...is to turn this rabble into something like an army.
Anything at all on when they plan to invade Holland?
They seem to have paused in Belgium.
Most likely supply problems.
Otherwise we can't imagine why.
I think it's because we're retreating...
...faster than they can advance.
How many vehicles in the past hour?
Fifty-four.
And for the same hour yesterday?
Ninety-eight.
Last week your mother and I could have captured Holland alone.
Already the panic has stopped.
It isn't over yet and those idiots don't realize it.
- War takes time.
- Listen to the expert.
I was nine when they got here.
Next month I'll be 14.
I ought to know something.
Father, the Allies will come?
But when?
I've just got back to England from Brussels...
...where I had a meeting this morning with Field Marshal Montgomery.
There was an earlier one with General Eisenhower.
They both feel, as I do...
...that when the Field Marshal's plan has succeeded...
...we should be able to end the war by Christmas...
...in less than 100 days.
Actually, the plan is really very simple.
We're going to fly 35,000 men 300 miles, and drop them behind enemy lines.
It'll be the largest airborne operation ever mounted.
Quite frankly, this kind of thing's never been attempted before.
- Where's this all going to take place?
- Holland.
- And when?
- I'm coming to that now.
Right.
The ground forces: 30 Corps, commanded by General Horrocks, 20,000 vehicles.
And this, as you know, is the German front line.
Now we're going to lay a carpet, as it were, of airborne troops...
...over which 30th Corps can pass.
We shall seize the bridges... it's all a question of bridges...
With thunderclap surprise...
...and hold them until they can be secured.
Now first of all,
General Maxwell Taylor...
...Eindhoven.
You take and hold the bridges there with 101 st.
General Gavin, with your 82nd...
...you get Nijmegen.
You take and hold the bridges.
And Roy, you get the prize:
Arnhem.
Arnhem Bridge.
- And you hold it.
- For how long?
Monty assures me that 30 Corps...
...will do the 63 miles in two days.
Sixty-three miles in two days.
- They oughta be able to handle that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
General Sosabowski, you go with your Polish Brigade with Roy Urquhart.
I'm so sorry.
Roy...
...when you've secured your bridge...
...and 30th Corps have got across it, we can turn east...
...right into the industrial heart of Germany... the Ruhr.
Once we control their factories, there's not much they can do about it.
And that is the plan.
And we go next Sunday.
Seven days?
Why not?
The sooner we go, the better.
We've got them on the run.
Is something troubling you,
General Sosabowski?
- I've said nothing.
- Precisely.
Your silences are thunderous.
General Browning, I...
I am a Pole...
...considered by some to be smart.
If that is so...
...it makes me member of a true minority group.
Minority groups are more comfortable in silence.
I should have thought the opposite was true. But you do disapprove?
I am thrilled that your great Field
Marshal Montgomery has devised a plan.
I promise you, I'll be properly ecstatic if it works.
When it works.
Of course.
When it works.
Thank you.
Well, now let's get down to the details.
First we shall have to have...
From which direction will their attack come, and who will command?
Montgomery or Patton?
- Model, what do you think?
- Patton.
He is their best.
Patton will lead the assault.
I would prefer Montgomery...
...but even Eisenhower isn't that stupid.
Bittrich's panzer troops need some rest...
...if they're to stop Patton.
We should pull them back somewhere safe.
Safe, quiet, out of the way.
But where?
Arnhem?
Arnhem.
- I'll be in touch.
- That'll be fine.
Why the emergency meeting?
- Keeping abreast of the little changes.
- How big are the little changes?
I'll answer you with typical
British understatement: gigantic.
They can't get us all in at once.
Too many men, too much equipment, not enough planes.
It's going to take three days to get the men into Arnhem, Poles and the British.
- How about us?
- We'll be all right.
Aside from the fact that we'll parachute in daylight, we have no worries.
Daylight?
- Has it ever been tried before?
- Not in a major drop.
- Think there might be a reason for that?
- Let's hope not.
- What do you think?
- It'll be all right.
It's a "no moon" period anyway.
We have to go in daylight.
Just so they get us over the target area, half a mile away.
Three-quarters of a mile...
I'll settle for that.
I don't want to hear anything else.
- Is there anything else?
- Well, you're my Dutch advisor, Harry.
I forgot to tell you something?
Only that the Germans first tried to take Nijmegen Bridge themselves...
...back in 1940, and got slaughtered.
Go back!
Go back!
Do as I say!
But my friend lives down the road.
It's my birthday and she has a present for me.
Please let me through.
All right. Be quick.
Are you sure about the colors?
I'm sure, Father.
Believe me.
Model?
A field marshal in Arnhem? Why?
The British will have an explanation.
Did you pass on the message about the tanks?
Of course. But Model is something more important.
You're a good boy and a wonderful spy.
Now go and help your mother with supper.
- Sir?
- Yes, Fuller?
- We've got some information on tanks.
- What?
Dutch Underground reports from the Arnhem area.
- Established their strength?
- No, sir, but I've got...
- Have they been identified?
- Not by our intelligence, sir.
So it's the same rumors as before, right?
- I believe these rumors, sir.
- Why?
The general consensus of opinion is that our opposition...
...will consist entirely of Hitler Youth or old men on bicycles.
I don't really know why, sir.
Perhaps because no one in Intelligence does.
I just want to be sure our airborne carpet...
...consists of live troops, not dead ones.
I know everybody thinks
I'm overanxious, sir...
...but I would like to order another low-level reconnaissance of the area.
If that's all right with you, sir.
Very well.
All right, Wilson.
Very well.
I wouldn't be too concerned about what people think of you.
You happen to be somewhat brighter than most of us.
Tends to make us nervous.
Naturally we'll do our utmost to meet your tactical requirements, sir.
But please keep in mind...
...the one factor which is crippling all our plans.
It may seem improbable to you...
...but we are desperately short of transport aircraft.
I am aware of that.
I was surprised that nobody mentioned it to Monty when he dreamed up this plan.
I need drop zones as close as possible to the bridge.
This area's no use at all.
Can't have my chaps landing on chimney tops, but this looks inviting here.
- What's the terrain like?
- Sorry, sir.
Our reports indicate that this terrain is too soft for glider landings.
The nose digs in first on touchdown, the thing goes ass over tip.
Total write-off.
All right.
- What about there?
- Afraid not, sir.
You see, after the drop, when we bank for our return...
...we run into a whole lot of flak...
...from this Jerry airfield up here at Deelen.
Presumably you're intending to let us land somewhere?
Oh, yes.
Hopefully, sir.
But as I was saying, we cannot afford to lose a single aircraft.
That is the problem.
My problem is,
I don't just need drop zones.
I need drop zones
I can hold and defend.
The rest of my division arrives with the second drop...
...and General Sosabowski's
Polish Brigade with the third.
I understand, sir, but we really think we've found the right place.
It's large enough for your needs, it's flat and firm.
- It's also easily defended.
- Where the hell is it?
Well, it's not actually on this photograph.
It should be...
Excuse me, sir...
It would be about here,
I think.
That could be ten miles from the bridge.
It's just under eight actually, sir, if you'd like to have a look at this.
You see, the terrain is easy to traverse.
All our information substantiates that.
Yes, sir?
Just making sure whose side you're on.
Now, a drop zone eight miles from Arnhem Bridge...
...might be thought by some to present problems.
My God, he can't mean it.
I'm afraid he does.
Must know what he's doing.
That's more than I know. Why should he have a corner on the market?
...cannot under any stretch of the imagination be considered ideal.
But the gliders will be bringing in a reconnaissance squadron of jeeps...
...specially fitted with twin Vickers machine guns.
The instant we land, they will race ahead to the bridge...
...and hold it...
...until the other battalions arrive on foot.
And they'll be quick enough to secure both ends of Arnhem Bridge?
- Most certainly.
- Good.
My headquarters will be in the center with 82nd.
Now, just you remember that we're all totally interlocked.
This is a bottom-to-top operation.
101 st pass 30 Corps on to 82nd.
82nd pass them on to British Airborne.
If any one group fails, it's total failure for us all.
All we need now are three days of clear skies.
Thank you, gentlemen, very much.
Only the weather can stop us now.
Weather! Cristos! 
What of the Germans?
Don't you think that since we know...
...that Arnhem is so crucial to their safety, they might know that too?
Now look here.
The few troops in the area are...
...second class.
They're not front-line caliber.
Not at all.
Do you understand?
You ought to have more faith in Montgomery's intelligence reports.
He's done pretty well for us in the last three or four years.
I will tell you the extent of my faith.
I'm thinking of asking for a letter from you...
...stating that I was forced to act on your orders...
...in case my men are massacred.
I see.
Yes, I do see.
Do you wish such a letter?
Of course not.
In the case of massacre, what difference would it make?
- You don't believe me, sir?
- Clearly not.
All right, boys, Naafi's up.
Take your break.
God Almighty!
Sorry about that, sir.
But what then?
I just don't believe these damn radios are strong enough...
...to carry the eight miles from the drop zone to Arnhem Bridge.
Don't happen to have any cigarettes, do you, sir?
They're perfectly okay.
I've used them God knows how many times.
You've already told me that
God knows how many times.
Well, I didn't have any problems with them in the desert.
Yes, I know, but you see, Cole...
...what genuinely and truly has me more than a bit disturbed is that Holland...
...being half underwater, is soggier than most deserts you're apt to find.
Tends to have a lot more trees.
- Any biscuits?
- Your biscuits are in your tin, sir.
Shouldn't you tell the general if you're so certain about it, sir?
If I were, believe me, I would.
- What if they really don't work?
- What difference will it make?
The general will be on the bridge himself by nightfall.
He won't have to make contact with the bridge if he's on it, will he, sir?
Well, if anyone rocks the boat...
...it's not gonna be me.
The regular projector chap's at lunch, sir. I'll have it in a moment.
You're doing splendidly, Fuller.
Don't worry. I don't need lunch.
Damn. Nearly there, sir.
It's really worth your time, sir.
Believe me.
There.
Splendid view of the Dutch countryside.
Can't see any tanks.
Wait a moment, sir.
It's a lot clearer in the next picture.
If I can just...
Now.
- Next.
- Yes, sir.
I've had this one enlarged.
I shouldn't worry about them.
But, sir, you see that they are tanks.
I doubt if they're fully serviceable.
- Still got guns.
- So have we.
But, sir...
...if they weren't serviceable, why would they try to conceal them?
Normal routine, Fuller.
But, sir, we keep getting reports from the Dutch Underground.
I've read them!
And so has Field Marshal Montgomery.
Now look here.
There have been thousands of photographs from this sortie and from the others.
- How many of them have shown tanks?
- Just these, sir.
And you seriously consider asking us to cancel...
...the biggest operation mounted since D-Day...
...because of three photographs?
No, sir.
Sixteen consecutive drops have been cancelled in the last few months...
...for one reason or another.
But this time the party's on...
...and no one is going to call it off.
Is that fully understood?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Waddy.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Do sit down, gentlemen.
Please sit down.
Look after these.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, this is a story that you will tell your grandchildren...
...and mightily bored they'll be.
The plan is called
Operation Market Garden.
Market is the airborne element, and Garden the ground forces...
That's us.
Now this is our position on the Belgian border here.
Tomorrow, three airborne divisions will begin landing in Holland...
Thirty-five thousand men taking off from 24 airfields...
...in troop-carrying planes or towed in gliders.
The American 101 st here...
...around Eindhoven...
...the American 82nd here...
...south of Nijmegen...
...and our own 1 st Airborne boys and a Polish brigade...
...here at Arnhem...
...sixty-four miles...
...behind enemy lines.
Now, their job is to take and hold...
...all the bridges in these three areas.
Our job is to punch a hole...
...through the German front line here...
...and then drive like hell up this road...
...linking up with each airborne division on the way up.
Speed is the vital factor.
The plan is to reach Eindhoven in two to three hours...
...and Arnhem in two to three days.
That, gentlemen, is the prize:
The bridge over the Rhine...
...the last bridge between us and Germany.
Kickoff will be at 1435 hours tomorrow afternoon.
The Irish Guards, under the command of
Colonel Vandeleur, will take the lead.
- Christ, not us again.
- What do you say to that, Joe?
Delighted, sir.
Truly delighted.
I've selected you to lead us...
...not only because of your extraordinary fighting ability...
...but also because...
...in the unlikely event that the Germans ever get you...
...they'll assume from your attire that they've captured a wretched peasant...
...and immediately send you on your way.
Now, maintaining the speed of our advance...
...will no doubt be tough going, as it's a single highway.
But no matter what...
...we must reach those
1 st Airborne boys in 48 hours.
Now, gentlemen...
...I'm not saying that this will be the easiest party...
...that we've ever attended...
...but I still wouldn't miss it for the world.
I like to think of this...
...as one of those
American Western films.
The paratroops, lacking substantial equipment...
...always short of food...
These are the besieged homesteaders.
The Germans... well, naturally they're the bad guys.
And 30 Corps...
We, my friends, are the cavalry...
...on the way to the rescue.
Do you want me to pack that as well, sir?
No, thank you, Wicks.
I'll carry it.
You haven't forgotten my golf clubs, have you?
They'll be coming later in the staff car, sir.
And what about...
Sorry, sir?
What about my dinner jacket?
Are you sure you'll be needing that, sir?
Well, let's hope so.
Why don't you quit that?
Chock-full of vitamins.
Here, Eddie.
Have a little strength.
Hey, where'd you put that?
- Damn it, Eddie, give it back.
- Right.
There you are.
I wish you hadn't done that.
My problem is, I'm not totally crazy about the prospect of dyin'.
So don't die.
Drinkin' that garbage isn't gonna keep you alive.
What is?
- Not gettin' shot.
- And what can guarantee that?
Nothin', for sure.
- You will.
- I will what?
You tell me, Eddie.
You tell me I won't die.
All right, you won't die.
No, no. Guarantee me.
I want you to guarantee me
I won't die.
I guarantee you.
Come on.
Let's get some food in you.
I wasn't kidding.
Hey, Eddie, were you kidding?
Major Fuller.
My name is Sims.
Mind a bit of company?
Of course not, sir.
Busy times.
You must be exhausted.
Are you exhausted?
Who isn't?
We've been getting reports from a number of your friends.
They're worried about you.
They think perhaps you need a rest.
We all need rest.
Why are you saying this to me?
Is it because
I rocked the boat?
I'm a doctor.
I'm only concerned with your health.
I think perhaps you ought to take a bit of sick leave.
But why?
I'm not ill or anything.
I haven't done anything wrong.
Of course not.
You're just a little tired.
I am tired.
I think perhaps we might go.
Can't it be stopped?
I don't want to be left behind, please.
It's out of my hands, laddie.
I didn't want to miss the party.
Move it, buddy.
That's the way.
Home, sweet home.
When you think we only had seven days to get everything organized, it's quite a...
Boody miracle.
It took six months to set up the D-Day drop...
...and that was only half as big as this.
- How do you feel?
- Fine.
I'll feel even better when we're in Holland.
Do you remember when I was appointed to this command...
...I told you I had never jumped, but thought I ought to give it a go?
- Well, you did me a big favor.
- Really? What?
You said, "Roy, you're far too old for that kind of thing, and much too large."
Did I?
What was the favor?
Well, I didn't quite tell you everything at the time...
...but I'm prone to airsickness.
Good gracious.
What, every flight?
Well, we'll soon find out, won't we?
Go on! Get that goddamn jeep outta here!
Who would true valor see
Let him come hither
One here will constant be
Come wind
Come weather
There's no discouragement
Soon be home, Harry.
- Better than the desert, eh, sir?
- What was that?
Easier than walking, sir.
If you say so, Hancock.
Yeah, fine, sir.
The artillery should be able to clear the way very well. Your initial advance.
Yes, we'll move off as soon as their barrage has got going.
- Yes, that's absolutely fine.
- Follow behind it as close as we can.
But you know...
...this isn't gonna be the pushover that everybody seems to think it is.
No, I didn't think so.
Morning, Alan. Your sleeping beauties know there's a war on, do they?
Absolutely, sir.
Is it true that the Germans have put more troops into the line ahead of us?
Yes. They obviously don't intend to just let us walk in the front door.
Hello, Bob! Hope that's not my funeral they're going to.
And I'm still desperately worried...
...about having them throw everything up this road.
But there's no alternative.
Morning, Tom.
So I've decided to run the road like a railway.
Nobody, repeat, nobody will be allowed...
...to put any vehicle on that road without my permission.
- Including me?
- Good luck to you!
You too!
Especially you, Joe.
Morning, Derek!
Glad to see somebody knows where we're going.
Time, Joe.
That's the killer.
We can't afford to drop behind schedule.
So for God's sake, keep your tanks on the move.
Good God Almighty.
That's just the 101 st.
The other two groups are on the northern route.
H hour in 90 minutes.
- I'd better be going, sir.
- Right you are, Joe.
- Any last-minute changes, Bob?
- Yes, sir.
If the advance runs into difficulty, we call in the Air Force with purple smoke.
First class.
And good luck, Joe!
Thank you, sir.
Think you'll be able to manage it?
I've got nothing else planned for this afternoon.
I told you you should have had the bloody thing out.
What the hell's that?
It's flak.
General Bittrich!
In here, Matthias.
Fantastic, isn't it?
Just once to have such power in my hands.
Red on.
Come on, move yourselves!
If there's no more opposition than this on the road, we should be all right.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
B Company, to me!
A Company, over there!
Excuse the interruption,
Field Marshal, but...
...British paratroopers have landed...
...three kilometers from here.
Why should they do that?
There is nothing important here.
Me! I am important.
They must all be coming just to capture me.
Call my chauffeur and car.
Evacuate the headquarters.
And don't forget my cigars.
General!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Okay, you guys, gather your stuff and move!
- This is it, Jim.
- Okay, sir.
You okay?
Right! Let's go!
Then keep trying.
There must be someone there!
My apologies.
I can get no sense from anybody.
They say thousands of troops are dropping over Holland.
- Yes, west of Arnhem.
- Right on top of Field Marshal Model.
I can't get through to his headquarters.
A strong force has landed south of Nijmegen.
Nijmegen?
They're after the bridge.
That doesn't matter.
Perhaps they've landed in the Field Marshal's soup.
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Now listen.
I'll take care of Arnhem.
You get to Nijmegen as fast as you can.
Take anything that'll move...
...every man that can walk, and hold the bridge.
No. Field Marshal Model.
Nothing must cross it.
Is that clear?
You must hold that bridge under any circumstances.
- Understood?
- Clear.
Ryan and Ross, come with me.
Cover the right flank.
How far away is headquarters?
Half a mile.
Maybe more.
Brigadier Lathbury's just left, sir.
Johnny Frost and the 2nd Battalion are on the river road.
Good.
Thank you, Baker. Any news of
Freddie Gough's jeep squadron?
- It's unconfirmed...
- It's rather bad luck, sir.
Considering how few gliders we lost on the way in.
It appears that a lot of the special jeeps failed to arrive...
...and those that did have been badly shot up in an ambush.
So no one's going to get to Arnhem Bridge except on foot.
Splendid.
They must be from the lunatic asylum, located on the far side of the wood.
They escaped when it was bombed this morning.
Do you think they know something we don't?
All guns, commence firing!
Right, get moving.
Get moving.
Driver, advance.
Start the purple!
Start the purple!
Take cover!
- Loading!
- Fire!
Get the wounded down the line.
Get that wreck off the road.
Joe, how the hell...
How the hell do they expect us to keep to schedule on a road like this?
You don't know the worst.
- This bit we're on now...
- Yes?
It's the wide part.
Peter, the general's coming in.
- How's it going now?
- Not too well, sir.
We haven't been able to make contact with General Browning...
...30 Corps or England.
So no one knows we've arrived safely.
Not as far as we know, sir.
What about those VHF sets?
Well, sir, it appears the sets have been delivered with the wrong crystals.
- So they're quite useless?
- Yes, sir, I'm afraid they are.
Are Brigadier Lathbury and Colonel Frost aware of what happened...
...to the special jeep squadron?
- Not as far as we know.
At the moment we're unable to contact any of the units moving into Arnhem.
Not a very satisfactory state of affairs.
We can't quite understand it.
It's perfectly good equipment.
Then for God's sake, get it sorted out...
...before we have a bloody disaster on our hands.
Sir.
Hancock...
...I've got lunatics laughing at me from the woods.
My original plan has been scuppered now that the jeeps haven't arrived.
My communications have completely broken down.
Do you really believe that any of that can be helped...
...by a cup of tea?
Couldn't hurt, sir.
Forgive me for returning,
Field Marshal.
I must press for permission...
...if it becomes necessary...
...to blow up the bridges at Arnhem and Nijmegen.
That is out of the question.
Never.
Is that clear?
We need them for our counterattack.
Counterattack?
With what?
Paratroopers cannot fight long.
They are too lightly equipped.
Isolated they are lost.
I have spoken to Von Rundstedt.
All reinforcements come to us first.
Every hour we get stronger and they grow weaker.
- But if we blow the bridges...
- They don't want the bridges.
Do you really think if they wanted the bridges...
...they would have landed
12 kilometers away?
It's ridiculous.
Thank you for the tea.
Our lightning-like assault on Arnhem Bridge...
...is certainly a smashing success.
I've an aversion to apples.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sure the Germans will be thunderstruck with surprise.
- Are there many of you?
- Yes, there are thousands of us.
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.
Look here, this isn't a victory parade.
Come on, sir, enjoy the moment.
I will enjoy the moment when we reach the bridge...
...and when we find the bridge intact.
It will be.
Things couldn't be going better.
- Nothing's wrong.
- I know. That's exactly what is wrong.
Jesus Christ!
Stay down!
Shit.
There's still no contact.
Then keep at it.
I shall be back shortly.
Brigadier Lathbury can't have gone that far. All right, Brown.
I'm sure we'll have them fixed by the time you get back, sir.
Can you get a message down to 30th Corps on that dingus?
Yes, sir. We just got word from the 82nd up ahead.
They've captured the Grave Bridge completely intact.
That's terrific, except 30th Corps...
...ain't about to reach the goddamn intact Grave Bridge...
...until the goddamn Son Bridge gets fixed.
Tell our British cousins to hustle up some Bailey stuff.
I'll meet 'em in Eindhoven when they get there.
Tell those schmucks to do this right and have their Bailey stuff at the front.
Got that?
And be sure to say please.
Joe, I make it just over six miles to Eindhoven.
We won't make it tonight.
It'll be dark shortly.
Well, I hope to God the 101 st can hang on till tomorrow.
Giles, remember what the general said:
"We're the cavalry."
It would be bad form to arrive in advance of schedule.
In the nick of time would do nicely.
These plans should have been left in England.
They're top secret.
And now we have all we need...
Units, defense plans, objectives...
...and the schedule for further drops.
I have prepared Nijmegen Bridge for demolition...
...if I blow it up tonight.
This Operation Market Garden must fail.
Why do all my generals want to destroy my bridges?
Come, Ludwig.
We'll have dinner.
Dinner?
But what about these plans?
These plans?
They are false.
Just a trick.
We were supposed to find them.
White wine or red?
We're still getting nothing from Colonel
Frost's battalion on the river road.
- Thank you, Cole.
- Dog-Charlie-Fox. Over.
Let's hope Johnny's meeting less resistance than we are.
- We must break through to the bridge.
- We're completely blocked ahead of us.
There's a good deal more resistance than we've been led to expect.
I must see for myself how he's doing.
All right, Cole.
- What is their strength?
- I can't estimate yet.
Some Dutch Underground people were here earlier trying to explain the situation.
I'm not sure how much they know.
Stretcher bearer, bring that stretcher over here to these men!
- What about Brown?
- They've both had it.
Christ Almighty!
They've gone round behind us.
I think it might be safer if you spent the night with us.
- I've got to get back to H.Q.
- Yes, but alive, sir.
If we can reach them, there are some houses in that direction.
We can get ourselves organized and try and find out what's happening.
Pull him out!
- Right.
- Sergeant Major.
Come on, lads.
Get a move on.
- Something just occurred to me.
- What's that, sir?
We're wearing the wrong camouflage.
It's all very well for the country, but we won't fool anyone in the towns.
Come on.
I'm awfully sorry, but I'm afraid we're going to have to occupy your house.
- All right, chaps, we're in here.
- The house on the other side.
- Section Two, over here.
- Dick.
Now, take your men, occupy that house across the road.
Make sure you can cover the bridge from your side.
Sergeant, follow me.
Hello, Dog-Charlie-Fox.
Rip down those curtains, pile this furniture against the window.
We've reached our objective.
What is your position? Over.
There's nothing.
I can't contact Brigade at all, sir.
Tried the other battalions?
Any luck?
Keep trying.
- Order them out.
- Please, Mother.
- This is my house.
- Perhaps by tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Yes, Mother.
Shall we have a go at the far end now, sir?
"Having a go" is hardly textbook terminology, Harry.
But you'll let us try, sir?
Down! Take cover!
Cover fire! Quick!
Smoke!
Come on, lads!
Come on. Keep going.
Give us a hand.
Fall back!
Hurry.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
We'll deal with them later...
...when it gets dark.
- Made it so far, Doddsie?
- Aye.
Better hit that slit first time.
Hey, Corp, I said you'd better hit that slit first time or...
I heard you, boyo.
Oh, great.
After you, Corp.
Come on.
Let's get on with it.
Now!
Now we're in trouble.
You bloody missed it!
You knocked my arm, you clumsy bastard.
Now we'll never get out of here.
We've hit an ammunition dump, a bloody ammo dump. Shit!
Fool's courage.
She says you are much too noisy.
She does realize there is something of a war going on, doesn't she?
She has never liked noise.
She hates it.
They're coming.
Excuse me.
Many of them?
Can't tell, sir.
We can only hear them at the moment.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Fire!
Command. Wait for the command.
Over there with it.
Look after that man.
Open fire! Fire!
Keep firing. Come on.
Cease firing.
Sorry, ma'am.
Try and rustle up some more bandages, will you?
Lad, you'll be all right.
See you later.
Get him patched up, Doc.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.
- Wicks.
- Sir.
Right, off you go.
Get that bloody stretcher inside!
All right. Here we go.
Good morning. Mr. Cornish is straight through there.
Right. Thank you.
Hello, Dick.
It's all right. Sit down.
- You all right?
- Fine. It's only a flesh wound.
- How are things?
- Not too bad, sir.
What is bad is this.
- Careful.
- Sorry.
We hold the north end of the bridge.
The Germans hold the south.
But now they probably control most of the town...
...including the church tower.
What you're saying is that we're surrounded.
Yes, something like that.
- What else?
- Sir.
I was a bit surprised to find
Bittrich's panzer troops here, sir.
Yes, well, surely you didn't believe all that nonsense they told us.
I mean, about the enemy being made up of old men, children.
We'll have to risk it.
It's halfway through the morning, and things aren't getting any better.
- Sergeant, how is it?
- Sir.
We can't clear the streets.
Enemy strength keeps increasing. It's impossible to get through to the bridge.
Thanks, Sergeant.
It's imperative I get back to H.Q. before the situation gets out of hand.
If it's all right with you, Cleminson and I will come part of the way.
- All right, Jimmy?
- Let's move.
End house, bottom window, sir.
Cleminson, get over here.
Hang on, Gerald.
In here. Come on.
Can't you move your legs?
Must be the spine.
Can you help us?
- How?
- Don't you know a doctor nearby?
We can take him to the hospital.
You go. He will be fine.
Go, sir.
You go.
Go up.
They're certainly at the back.
What's it like at the front?
We're surrounded.
Yes. Quite.
I was rather expecting to see you again, General Sosabowski.
Do please sit down.
The Polish drop has been cancelled again. I would like an explanation.
Well, I expect the fog has a certain amount to do with it.
I'm told there are aircraft flying
50 miles to the south.
Explain to me why my men and equipment cannot be moved from here to there...
...and then fly to Arnhem.
That's a very reasonable question.
I don't want to bother you with a lot of meteorological mumbo jumbo...
...but the fact is, you see, whether we like it or not...
...fog... it moves.
Of course it moves. Where?
That's very difficult to say, General.
It's very slippery stuff, fog.
You think you've got it, then it reverses itself...
...and leaves you behind.
Won't you please sit down?
What I'm trying to say, General...
...is even if we move your troops the 50 miles...
I grant you, now the sun is shining...
...the chances are that by the time we get there...
...the fog could quite easily have preceded us.
- So we simply have to wait.
- And do nothing.
I think that puts it rather well.
Hey, you! You Vandeleur?
- Yeah.
- I'm Bobby Stout.
How do you do?
Hell of a day, huh?
Look at 'em... wild.
Have you ever been liberated?
- I got divorced twice. Does that count?
- Yes, that counts.
Hey, that Bailey crap.
You got it amongst this stuff?
When you refer to Bailey crap...
...I take it you mean that glorious precision-made British-built bridge...
...which is the envy of the civilized world.
- Yeah.
- The trucks are down there somewhere.
But how you're going to get them through this crowd, I don't know.
No problem. I got a side road pegged out that'll avoid all this.
- American ingenuity.
- Oh, really?
Actually I was born in Yugoslavia, but what the hell.
Yes.
Okay, I'll take it, sir.
- Where the hell have you been?
- With some Dutch friends at Nijmegen.
Look. This is why we can't take the bridge.
The Germans have moved in
S.S. panzer troops.
You'd think they didn't want us to get across or something.
They've sealed off the whole area.
Here. You can see on this map.
Every street leading to the bridge is blocked.
Every house around it is occupied.
The Dutch Underground people say it's just impossible to break through.
They could be right.
- Where's the captain?
- Dead.
I didn't ask you how he was.
I asked you where he was.
Orderly, we're all out of bandages over here.
- Sir.
- Not now.
- I'd like you to look at my captain.
- I'm sorry. Put him down.
What in the name of hell do you...
- You told me to put him down.
- I'm in no mood for crapping around.
If you don't look at him right now, he's going to die.
He's dead now.
It'd mean a lot to me if you'd check him out.
Come on, Sergeant.
For Christ's sake, get him out of here.
Would you look at him, please, sir...
...right now...
...or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Right now.
I can give him a quick examination, if you like.
Thank you very much, sir.
Son of a bitch.
Orderly!
Well, I got the bullet out of his skull.
- He's gonna live though, right?
- He's gonna have one hell of a headache.
Guess you can turn me in now, sir.
That was a court-martial offense.
You understand that?
- Yes, sir.
- Hope to hell it was worth it.
Guess only time will tell on that, sir.
My response is strictly limited, regardless of my personal preference.
- You understand that too?
- I do.
Like somebody cheating in school.
Once word gets out that you can behave any way you goddamn please...
...discipline's gone, forget about getting it back.
So you're gonna have to be arrested, over and out. Lieutenant Rafferty.
Yes, sir, Colonel.
Lieutenant Rafferty, this is Sergeant... What's your name?
Eddie Dohun.
Sergeant Dohun pulled a gun on me and threatened to kill me...
...unless I did precisely what he ordered.
- I want you to put him under arrest.
- Yes, sir.
I want you to keep him there for at least ten seconds.
- I'm not all that sure I understand.
- Count to ten, Lieutenant, fast.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Like that?
Thank you, Lieutenant.
This is yours, I think.
It sure looks like mine.
You scared the shit out of me, you stupid bastard.
You did a fine job yourself, if it makes you feel any better.
Goddamn right it does.
- Eddie?
- Sir.
You wouldn't really have killed me, would you?
Thank you, sir.
Right!
Let's haul a little ass! Go!
Hold! Hold!
Move it. Come on, soldier, you're not building a sand castle.
Come on, boys.
Use your muscle.
Heave.
Come on, heave!
Unload quickly.
- It's all right, sir.
- Come on, move yourself.
We haven't got all day.
Come on, push!
Altogether, lift!
Come on, soldier, pound it.
We've got a schedule to meet.
Steady.
Hold it.
- How much longer now?
- About another four hours, sir.
Shit.
Come on, boys.
We're not doing this for fun.
- Hey, soldier, get over here.
- Yes, sir.
- Pull on this rope.
- Yes, sir.
Didn't you ever build a Bailey bridge before?
Neither did I.
Clear the way! Clear!
We haven't got all day.
Roll it, fellas!
Right. Come on. All aboard.
Let's get moving again.
- Thanks, fellas.
- Be seeing you.
- What's wrong, sir?
- They're 36 hours behind schedule.
Lieutenant.
Sir.
We'll be turning you over to the 82nd now.
They're good soldiers, the 82nd.
Just be sure you keep your hand on your wallet at all times.
Yes, sir.
They're here.
It's 30 Corps.
They're here, chaps.
You're late, you lazy bastard, but we'll forgive you!
That was gracious of me.
Take cover!
Bring up the Piat.
Make sure it's within range.
Come on! You'll miss him.
Right, lads! Go, go!
Corporal!
I need a jeep.
Well done, laddie.
- We thought you were dead.
- I can assure you it was an error.
That was the bleeding general.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir.
Carry on, thank you.
Good morning, Baker.
Good morning, James.
Harry. Apologies for my enforced absence. Dennis.
- Sir.
- Lathbury's been put out of action.
I'd like you to go into town, take over the brigade.
- How soon can you leave?
- Right away.
Pull them together and keep pushing forward to the bridge.
Did the rest of the division arrive safely?
Yes, but we've run into all kinds of trouble.
It would seem that we've landed on top of two S.S. panzer divisions.
Good God.
As you can imagine, it's hard to stop tanks...
...with rifles and machine guns.
- Show me.
You can see what we're up against.
Johnny Frost and some of his chaps have managed to get as far as the bridge.
But the Germans are driving down here towards the river...
...and may even now have cut them off completely.
Now the entire division is here, we should be able to break through to him.
It certainly gives us more of a chance.
Sosabowski's Polish brigade is due in at 12:00.
If it arrives.
Yesterday's airlift was three hours late due to fog in England.
The gliders bringing the Poles' equipment didn't arrive at all.
- Now give me the good news.
- I'm afraid there isn't any, sir.
As you can see, we're more or less surrounded.
So far we're holding our own, but we're desperately short of food, medicine...
...and above all, ammunition.
- Are we getting our daily supply drop?
- Oh, yes.
The Royal Air Force are flying in on schedule.
The trouble is, the Germans have overrun the dropping zones.
- Don't our pilots know that?
- I'm afraid not, sir.
In heaven's name, why?
It's the radios, sir.
We still haven't been able to make contact with anyone outside Arnhem.
Fools!
Boody fools, this way!
We're over here!
We're here!
- This way.
- Drop 'em over here.
What the hell are they doing?
They must be able to see us.
They can see us all right, laddie...
...but they're under orders to ignore signals from the ground.
For all they know, we could be Germans.
They're giving it all to the bloody Germans.
Charles.
Poor bastard.
Oh, well, maybe tomorrow.
Here.
He'll never make it.
Those bleeding snipers will get him.
Come back!
Come on, Ginger mate.
- He'll never lift it.
- Come on, mate!
Bring it back, mate.
Come on.
Come on!
Run, laddie, run!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Taxi!
- Do you get all that?
- She wants somebody to call her a taxi.
Taxi.
- Doctor.
- Good evening, Kate.
May I introduce Mrs. Ter Horst,
Colonel Weaver.
Is your husband not returned yet?
He should have been here by now.
He must be having difficulties coming through the German lines.
Well, in that case...
...we will have to ask you for a decision.
Colonel Weaver has a request to make.
What we've done is we've set up...
...a defensive pocket, more or less thumb-shaped...
...with the river as the base.
Mrs. Ter Horst speaks surprisingly good English, Colonel.
Then you understand that we're in quite a strong position...
...for holding out until 30 Corps reaches us.
But we have to make certain arrangements.
The words come through. I don't know if I follow the military strategy.
We have the main hospital, of course, but it is full to bursting.
Perhaps you understand that we have great need...
...of additional space.
Our house would seem suitable.
It's just for the slightly wounded.
You know, we'll patch them up, send them back... that sort of thing.
I feel it will need a little more than that.
We're wasting time. Come.
- Doctor.
- Thank you, Kate.
I will see you.
I will come back.
You come in. Let's see.
Please sit.
Come take this chair.
- Come over here with me, lads.
- Thanks very much.
Sit down.
Let me help you.
Oh, colonel, the major wants you upstairs, sir.
Okay. Thank you.
All right?
Thank you.
Still in one piece, Dodds?
Good. All right, Potter?
That's far enough!
We can hear you from there.
Rather an interesting development, sir.
My general says there is no point in continuing this fighting.
He is willing to discuss a surrender.
Tell him to go to hell.
We haven't the proper facilities to take you all prisoner!
Sorry.
What?
We'd like to, but we can't accept your surrender.
Was there anything else?
All right.
And now?
Flatten Arnhem.
- Any movement at Nijmegen?
- None.
No way of bLasting through to the bridge?
I'd lose all my men for nothing. There's
God knows how many out there already.
You mean it's over?
I didn't say that, did I?
We've paid for that bridge, and we're going to collect.
But to do it,
I need tank support.
You've got it, Jimmy.
The Grenadier Guards will be happy to oblige. Is that all right, Alex?
Absolutely.
It's not just tanks.
I need boats.
If 30 Corps were American, we would have boats. Did you bring any?
- Mike?
- We might have a few about somewhere.
- Can you get them here by tonight?
- It won't be easy.
We've got one road, ten-mile traffic jams on it...
...and Germans throwing shells at us.
- I don't know quite what we can do...
- Except try. You can do that, can't you?
Thank you, gentlemen.
Now, look here.
About these boats...
What is your opinion?
How many?
The general's a bit scratchy today, but it's nothing personal.
When we dropped on Sunday...
...I think he cracked his spine.
- How many boats have we got then?
- About six in each truck.
Where's Major Cook, soldier?
- I think over there, sir.
- Thank you.
Julian, where the hell are you?
Here, sir.
We're going to take
Nijmegen Bridge tonight.
- What's the best way to take a bridge?
- Both ends at once.
I'm sending two companies across the river by boat.
I need a man with very special qualities to lead.
Go on, sir.
He's got to be tough enough and experienced enough to do it.
Plus one more thing.
He's gotta be dumb enough to do it.
Start getting ready.
What was all that about?
Well, someone's come up with a real nightmare.
Come on! Keep moving!
We just got word from the Dutch Resistance people at Arnhem.
- And?
- It's not going well for the British.
Their main force never reached the bridge.
Those that did are hanging on by their fingernails.
- And General Urquhart?
- He's got his back to the river.
The Germans trapped his men in a pocket and they're squeezing it smaller.
How long can he hold?
Where are those goddamn boats?
Just keep it clear.
Right.
They're no further than we thought. Julian.
- Sir.
- There's been a change in plans.
We're gonna make the crossing in daylight.
- Daylight.
- Traffic's all screwed up for miles.
By the time we're ready, it'll be 0800.
- That's when we go.
- Fine.
I'd like to wait and go tomorrow night, but the British can't hold.
Better by daylight.
Much.
- Any news of the boats?
- No. We're switching...
- You want some?
- No, thank you.
We're switching the start to 9:00 just to make sure.
You start laying smoke just before we go.
Fine.
They're going to get creamed from the far embankment.
Your smoke screen's gonna be their only protection.
Don't worry.
We'll cover you.
Please.
Okay, can I have your attention, please?
I'm pleased to inform you that our 9:00 departure has been postponed till 10:00.
So you can all have an extra hour's fun and relaxation.
- Major?
- Yes.
We got any more information on those boats?
We're reliably informed that they float.
Outside of that, we don't know squat.
Not how many, not how heavy, not how big.
We are sure that the river is wide and that the current is strong.
As any more cheery information comes my way, I'll be happy to pass it along.
In the meantime, just think of this as on-the-job training.
What's the matter?
No sense of humor?
Goddamn it!
We go at noon.
Come on. Clear those roads!
You men are probably wondering why I've called us here together.
I've reached a decision that I'd like to share with you all.
I intend to go across like George Washington...
...standing on the prow.
You guys can do the rowing.
- That's it! Move 'em out!
- Here we go!
Get up there, guys.
It's heavy.
What the...
What'd you expect, destroyers?
Come on, put it together. Unload 'em.
Easy on them, guys.
- How many more?
- Get those sides up.
Fire!
What else can you see besides smoke?
Nothing yet, but they are going to try a river assault.
It will fail.
Of course it will fail, but...
...what do we do if it doesn't?
I ask your permission to blow up the bridge.
Out of the question.
I understand, Field Marshal.
They will not cross the river and we will blow no bridges.
Have all demolition charges been checked?
Yes, sir.
Everything is wired and ready.
Captain Krafft is standing by as ordered.
The bridge will not fall into enemy hands.
As soon as the first
British tank starts to cross...
...I'll blow it sky-high.
- Let's get going!
- All right! Go, go, go!
Go on. Don't wait. Go.
Jump in, boys.
If you don't have an oar, use your rifle butts, anything.
Row!
One, two.
The current's taking us down.
Stay to your right.
- Support fire ordered, sir.
- Right. Thank you.
Get down!
Hail Mary, full of grace.
We're drifting!
Pull to your left!
Pull!
Keep it going, boys.
Keep rowing.
Stay down.
Come on, boys.
Thy will be done.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go!
Snipers!
Help me.
Go up the side.
Second platoon!
- Can we make it through the tunnel?
- No way, sir.
Up the bank.
Cover.
Come on.
Sergeant.
Take four across, draw fire.
Harry and I'll go up the side.
You cover.
Go, go, go!
Come on.
Let's go!
Are you ready?
Yes, General.
Goddamn it.
My God, they're only
18 kilometers from Arnhem.
Who can stop them now?
No one.
Oh, hell.
Any chance, Whitney?
No, sir, not unless we're relieved in the next few hours.
Harry?
- Try and get him down to the cellar.
- Very good, sir.
It's working.
I'm through to H.Q.
Where's the colonel?
- Down below.
- Get him.
- Colonel Frost!
- What is it?
Up top.
It's Headquarters, sir, on the radio.
Coming.
Sunray on set.
Pass your message. Over.
What's your situation, Johnny?
Over.
I hadn't expected the pleasure, sir.
We are holding out.
We need reinforcements and above all, ammunition. Over.
I'm not sure if it's a case of us coming for you...
...or you coming for us.
Well, we'll just wait for 30 Corps then.
That would probably be best.
Very reassuring talking to you, sir.
I'm sorry, Johnny, getting stuck on that bloody bridge...
...four days on your own.
Have you anything else for me?
No, sir. I'll give you a call when our friends arrive. Over.
All right.
Good luck. Out.
- Sergeant Tomblin!
- Here, sir.
I'm coming over.
Sergeant Taylor!
I don't understand.
Why aren't you moving?
What's the matter with you guys?
Those are British troops at Arnhem.
They're hurt bad.
You're not gonna stop, not now.
I'm sorry.
We have our orders.
We busted our asses getting here.
Half my men are killed.
You're just gonna stop...
...and drink tea?
We're now facing a completely different situation.
We can't lead with tanks up that road.
Jerry'll pick us off like sitting ducks.
Our infantry is fighting in Nijmegen.
When they get here, we'll move on.
For Christ's sake, must you do everything by the book?
Our orders are to wait for the infantry.
I'm sorry, but there it is.
It's Major Carlyle, sir.
All right. I'm all right.
Things are not so good, eh?
I've been meaning to ask you something...
...and I haven't because I know you were so anxious that I should...
...and I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.
Why the hell do you always carry that bloody umbrella?
- Memory.
- What?
Bad memory.
Always forgot the password.
I knew no Jerry...
...would ever carry one.
I had...
...to prove I was an Englishman.
Get back!
Back into the houses.
30 Corps, please hurry.
- Nothing, sir.
- All right. Thank you, Corporal.
It's no use in any event.
Take my boot off, will you, Wicks?
Hello, 30 Corps.
Oh, God!
We're out of ammunition anyway.
Right. Off you go, Wicks.
Join the rest of the lads.
Try and get back to the main force.
- What about you, sir?
- I'll be all right.
We just didn't make it this time, did we?
Calling 30 Corps.
Come in, please.
My general says please take it.
It's very good chocolate.
Your planes dropped it to us yesterday.
English.
Action stations!
God bless
Field Marshal Montgomery.
Would five minutes be too much?
Just five minutes respite.
Dear God...
...grant these young men...
...die in peace and quiet.
I'm sorry, lads, but you're going to have to move.
Please.
Take my hand.
We're a bit late with this one, mate.
"Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler...
...and from the noisome pestilence.
He shall cover thee with His feathers...
...and under His wings shalt thou trust.
His truth shall be thy shield and buckler."
There you go. Head back.
You'll be all right now, chum.
Can it get worse?
Oh, yes, much worse.
Bring up the bulldozer.
Stretcher bearer!
Help me!
Stretcher.
Easy, now. Take it easy.
Morphia. I must have morphia.
Morphia is only for the people who are really hurt.
I thought I was really hurt.
Well, you're wrong.
I asked him to come over, but Dr. Spaander does agree with me.
- We've got to do something about them.
- Yes, what? Good day, Doctor.
General Urquhart, we have no more space and we have no more supplies.
And since a prisoner of war...
...has more chance than no chance at all...
I have a mind to ask the Germans...
...to accept our wounded into their hospitals...
...if we could arrange evacuation.
- Have I your permission to try?
- Certainly.
If Weaver agrees.
But I hardly think the Germans will.
Those are our guns out there.
That's 30 Corps.
I don't think my permission is going to be your major problem.
I've come with a message from General Urquhart.
How you manage that?
I swam the Rhine, sir.
I'm afraid the radios are all up the spout.
The general asks if you'll get your men across the river.
We've been holding out for six days now.
Any help at all would be of considerable assistance.
You swim back with reply?
Yes, sir.
Well, we can't swim...
...not with equipment.
We have small rubber boats, that's all.
I'm afraid rubber dinghies may be a bit flimsy for the Rhine, sir.
I agree.
Tell the general we're coming.
We're coming tonight.
Yes, sir.
Not possible.
If you would just say yes, it would be very possible.
Forgive me, but there is a battle...
...and we are in the process of winning it.
Winning and losing is not our concern.
Living or dying is.
Cease fire...
...one more hour, two...
...just to evacuate our wounded.
Afterwards you can kill us as much as you want to.
General Ludwig.
- Will you thank him, please?
- I just did.
Please, you can go.
How short are we? A mile?
Why don't we just try to bash through?
For God's sake, it must be worth it.
They're trying to force Urquhart away from the river.
Now, once they do that...
...once they've got him surrounded, he'll be annihilated.
Not in Monty's plan at all.
Have we replaced the boats we lost at Nijmegen?
Yes.
Well?
Well, then?
Well, that's it then.
We're pulling them out.
It was Nijmegen.
It was the single road getting to Nijmegen.
No, it was after Nijmegen.
And the fog...
...in England.
It doesn't matter what it was.
When one man says to another,
"Today let's play the war game"...
...everybody dies.
"Withdraw"?
Two days, they said.
We've been here nine.
One bloody mile. You'd think they could accomplish that.
- Hancock, here are another two.
- All right. Thank you.
They're the last two
I could find.
Charles?
We've been given our marching orders.
If they discover we're leaving, they'll go all out to destroy us.
So we must take every precaution.
I've designed this like a collapsing bag.
Macdonald here has agreed to man the wireless...
...in order to give the Germans something to listen to.
All the padres and medical staff have volunteered to stay behind as well.
Now, the wounded who are too bad to move...
...will replace the men firing...
...so our defense will seem as before.
By the time the Germans find out what's happening...
...we should all be safely across the river.
- Pleasant journey.
- Thank you, sir.
- Are you all right, laddie?
- Thank you, sir.
I'm beginning to believe we're actually going to make it, sir.
I thought everyone knew
God was a Scotsman.
Come on. Don't hang about.
General Browning will be down right away, sir.
He wondered if you perhaps might like to change.
- Change?
- Your clothes, sir.
No, thanks.
Hello, Roy.
How are you?
I'm not sure that I'll know for a while.
But I'm sorry about the way it worked out.
You did all you could.
Yes, but did everyone else?
They've got a bed for you upstairs, if you want it.
I took 10,000 men into Arnhem.
I've come out with less than 2,000.
I don't feel much like sleeping.
Quite.
I've just been on to Monty.
He's very proud and pleased.
- Pleased?
- Of course.
He thinks Market Garden was 90/ successful. 
But what do you think?
Well, as you know, I've always thought we tried to go a bridge too far.
Mind his head.
Thanks, Taff.
Abide with me
Fast falls
The eventide
The darkness
Deepens
Lord, with me abide
When other
Helpers fail
And comforts flee
Help of the helpless
O abide
With me
Hold Thou Thy cross
Before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom
DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR
He he he! Hey!
Monseigneur.
Buenas tardes, amigos!
The taxes are here, Minister.
Excises, tithes, spice tax, how much is it...
...for this year?
200,000 ducats.
But last year it was a lot more!
- But last year the harvest was better.
This year the harvest was not that good, so you have to pay double.
Taxes. They're all for the King!
Don Salluste, our people are very poor and...
That's normal.
The poor are poor and the rich are rich.
Come on, come on...
Hurry up!
I have 3 more villages left to visit.
Collect all that. Quickly.
Where's the cheering?
The enthusiasm?
Long live Don Salluste.
Long live Don Salluste.
Long live our benefactor.
Long live our benefactor.
Long live our great friend.
- Long live our great friend.
Ole.
- Ole.
Ole.
- Ole.
That wasn't very...
Never mind, never mind.
You wouldn't think so, but that coach isn't very reliable.
What?
I'm saying that coach isn't very reliable.
It's a real sieve.
He's going to lose a lot...
Blaze
- Yes.
So, if I were you...
Go, go. Follow them.
Follow the coach.
All that is for the King.
That's for me.
That's for me.
That's for me.
That's for me.
Hey, careful!
Hey. Whoa! Careful!
The spices. Who gets the spice tax?
Is it for Salluste?
No! It's for the King! Yes! No!
Leave me in peace.
And the tithes? Who gets them?
The King? No, it's for Salluste.
Thief! Not a thief!
It's for Salluste, there!
Look out!
Wait,
Monseigneur.
I'll help you.
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
My ruff!
I'll help you, Monseigneur.
No!
That's my gold!
And my gold is my money.
And I don't need you.
Are you sure?
What's happening?
The villagers, monseigneur!
They're cheering you on.
Cheering me on?
Yes.
I should have taken three times more from them.
Ha!
Ha!
- Kill him!
Blaze!
Blaze!
Blaze!
Help!
Aaahhh! Blaze!
Help.
Help.
Help.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop now.
Wait for me.
Help me.
Why did you get out?
My dear Blaze.
Ah! Take this.
My hand.
Help me, my dear Blaze.
Hold tight, my dear Blaze.
Don't let go. My dear Blaze.
Blaze is such a good man.
Thank you, my dear Blaze.
They're not cheering me on.
They're not cheering me on. They're not.
Here! And here!
And here!
They were not cheering.
They were not cheering. Here!
The villains.
You saw them! They almost...
- Yes.
That's what the masses are like.
No, not there!
Not there!
There!
There's not enough foam.
Not enough hair either.
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
Don't move.
Ouch!
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
There.
And now, Blaze...
...flatter me.
Monseigneur is the greatest of the Spanish Grandees.
That's not flattering, that's true. So?
Idiot.
What?
"Idiot" is what I said to the servant of the
Duke of Albes. No! No, my master is not...
"...the result of a marriage between relatives."
"Have another look at him", he said to me.
So I told him not to judge on appearances.
Just because his mother married the half-brother of his aunt...
...who was a first cousin of the sister of his father, who... who...
Are you sure that's flattery?
I was going to say something else, but I didn't dare.
Oh, come on, speak.
Yes!
Monseigneur is... beautiful.
Do you really mean that?
Well, I'm flattering.
Good night, your Majesty.
Was ist das?
The Queen.
Ach! Schön...
Vergissmeinnicht.
Forget-me-nots.
The Queen has an admirer.
But that's worth a lot of money.
But that's Blaze!
There's the old lady.
That's going to be interesting!
A Queen of Spain does not accept flowers from anybody.
Not even from the King!
Aahh! Now the big gallows-bird starts singing.
Hey, you up there! Blaze!
Blaze, shut up. You'll wake up the entire palace.
Niemals waren
Liebeswörter an mein Ohr.
Warum?
It's the Queen. She's from Bavaria.
She's pretty but stupid.
My young German heart in exile shivers at this serenade...
Your Majesty.
A Queen of Spain does not listen to music...
...when the King is out hunting.
Who goes hunting loses his place.
Hey.
Because I love the Queen.
Me, a servant, I dare.
Now he's stamping around.
Hey, wait, you'll see.
Blaze, my servant, in love with the Queen.
He's crazy.
He will be drawn and quartered.
You'll see....
Come here, you.
Come here, you.
He's singing, he's dancing around.
He's stamping his feet. Hey!
That's enough... playing the gallant...
...at 2 in the morning?
Hey!
Ho!
Ah! Let go of that.
Let go.
It's gold.
Golden sunrays of dawn.
Wake up and smell the gold.
Monseigneur.
It's 8 o'clock.
Gouchi, gouchi, gouchi.
There's one missing.
Are you sure?
Very sure.
Well, I'll be...
Look under the bed.
There it is.
It's there.
Look!
Come on, look!
What?
- Look. You're too tall.
You're my servant.
You're too tall. Come on.
This is what I want to see.
This is what I want. This is good.
Give me my breadsticks.
Monseigneur seems to be in a good mood, this morning.
In a good mood? No, I'm not.
And you know very well why not.
Why not?
Why!? Because yesterday, bom bom bom and tagada tagada!
Gling gling gling and tarata taratata!
Monseisei... Monseisei...
Monseigneur!
It's the... the...
The what?
The Queen!
The Queen here, at this hour?
Quick, my jerkin, my fleece, hurry.
Remove this.
Dress me. Dress me quickly.
Yes, that's it. That's it. The little Infante,
I've got her.
I won't let her go.
I didn't know Monseigneur and the Infante...
The ruff.
The ruff? Here's the ruff. - Blaze, you don't know what the Queen's going to announce.
I will be the son-in-law of the King.
That's remarkable...
...since they don't have any children.
His niece, it's the same thing.
The King only needs to have a hunting accident.
Paf!
Big cousin Léopold: Paf! Paf!
The little Count of Anjou: Bang!
Everybody... Lots of hunting accidents.
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
And then.... I... King.
- And also, we'll be spared...
...the War of the Spanish Succession.
Her Majesty, the Queen.
- Quick, tidy up.
Make way for the Queen.
Ruhe!
Ruhe, die Hunde! Ruhe!
Sie haben meine Ehrendame...
...entehrt.
I... uhm... what?
Was?
Und die Unschuld eines jungen Deutschen...
...Mädchens missbraucht!
Ah!
Danke schön!
The little Infante!
Schön!
Ich bin happy meine tante...
Meine auntie! Ah!
Raus, die Zwerge!
Los, raus, schnell!
Raus... Schnell...
Such a pretty language.
Sie sind abgesetzt, verbannt und ausgewiesen.
Ihr Vermögen ist beschlagnahmt zu Gunsten der Krone.
What is she saying?
Don Salluste, you have been dismissed, disgraced...
...exiled.
You lose your title of Knight...
...of the Golden Fleece...
...and your functions as Minister of Police and of Finance.
And all your belongings will be confiscated and given to the crown.
But what did I do?
Ein Kind, Don Salluste!
A child.
Your Majesty.
What's that?
Who's that?
You refuse to recognise...
...this child of my maid of honour?
I can't recognise it.
I don't know it.
Ja! Ja! Ja!
What ja ja ja?
Nein!
Zeduzed and abandoned... is what he did.
Verfürt und verlassen.
Liar!
She's a liar.
She's lying in German.
This child is a false witness.
Warum nicht! Ich habe nicht!
She and I, nada! Nada! Never!
Nothing!
Your Majesty, das ist eine collossal konspirazion!
Don Salluste, you will leave Madrid tomorrow.
After having returned your Golden Fleece to the King.
Madame! Madame!
Your Majesty, are you going to base your opinion on a new-born?
Ok then, I agree, I recognise this child.
I recognise my mistakes...
...my children, other people's children.
Your children, if you like.
Old villain!
Miscreant!
Look at him.
He's as green as his gloves.
His disgrace is good for us.
Tomorrow, he'll return his Golden Fleece to the King.
That's an unexpected slice of fortune.
We have to act quickly.
Oh, amigos!
Amigos!
Hey!
Not that. That's mine. That's mine.
No! That's mine too.
No, you can't have my table.
Hey you!
Give us a hand.
- Sure.
There we go.
My cutlery.
The Queen said to take everything.
Everything!
But I didn't take anything.
Yes, you did.
Who put that in my pants?
What will become of me?
I'm a minister. I can't do anything.
We just have to find a place for the two of us, Monseigneur.
Oh you, get lost!
Disappear! I never want to see you again.
And my wages? Who'll pay my wages?
- Your wages? Here, take this.
I dispel you.
You don't exist anymore to me.
Excuse me...
Excuse me!
That's my broom.
- Bandit! Thief! Scoundrel!
And you, little Queen.
Bitch!
I'll get my revenge.
Here.
One-eyed man!
Monseigneur?
Do you know César?
- The bandit?
César the bandit. - Yes.
- You must find him.
Nobody has seen him for 10 years
And with one eye...
You can see very well with one eye.
Yes, you're right. You don't see very well.
But once you find the first half...
...the other half can't be far.
César, my nephew!
Crook! Lout!
I'm here!
Scoundrel.
It's me.
Where are you?
Up here.
Up where?
Over here.
Ah! There he is.
I'm coming.
Hello, old creep.
Did you come out of your hole?
Do you need me?
I have a proposition for you.
Does it pay well?
A fortune: mine!
Do you think...
...I'm as stupid as your ass?
No, not that way.
Not this way. Keep going.
Listen to me.
César, the bandit, the villain, disappears.
He's forgotten. Paf!
He's forgotten. Gone.
And you become Don César.
And I'll tell the whole court that you've come back from America.
And...
...you seduce the Queen.
Is it true what they say?
Did you fall into disgrace with her?
You seduce the Queen.
I send an anonymous letter to the King.
He catches you both repudiates her...
...and puts me back into power.
And do you think you can find an idiot in Spain...
...who would be part...
...of this conspiracy?
An idiot! But I had one!
And I was stupid enough to fire him.
Because you won't do it, will you?
Follow me.
Very good. Very good.
There he is, Monseigneur.
What shall we do with him?
To Africa! To the Berbers!
Traitor, you're an even...
...bigger coward than I thought.
Sell him. I never want to hear about him again.
Go!
Death to Salluste!
Kill Salluste!
Long live the King!
- Kill...
...Salluste!
Death to Salluste!
There, there.
Hey.
What's that?
Well?
A lady like you...
...walking the streets of Madrid at this hour? That's not prudent.
Would it be more prudent like this, idiot?
Monseigneur!
- Quiet!
You know why I'm here?
- What?
Do you know why I'm here?
No.
Ever since you left me...
...I've been so sad.
The lady doesn't realise what she's saying, Monseigneur.
Yes, I do. I thought about you so much...
...since this morning.
Give me your hand. - No!
- Give it.
Give me your hand.
What a future.
You're ugly, she's beautiful.
You're broke, she's very rich.
You're an idiot, so is she.
You're a servant,...
...she's the Queen.
It's written there.
She doesn't even know
I exist.
What if I used a magic wand,...
...to make the differences disappear for a night?
What if I turned you...
...into Prince Charming?
Give me back your hand.
No.
Yes.
- No!
You have a chance.
And I am your chance.
This way,
Monseigneur.
On your knees for the King.
He likes people flat on the ground for him.
When he arrives, crawl. - And the Queen?
Even flat on the ground, she'll recognise me.
Do you know how many servants like you there are...
...in this palace?
- No.
800! So...
Let's start again.
So, I don't say "at the barber's" but "at the barber".
No, the other way around. You don't say "at the barber", but "at the barber's".
And you don't say
"hello there"...
But "it's very happy here to meet you".
That's very good.
That's very good.
But your place is terrible.
How can you live in such a decrepit house?
This is where Monseigneur houses his personnel.
Ahh! It's nice.
It's very nice.
Are you content with it?
Well?
- Yes.
Get undressed.
What's your name?
Don César,
Count of Gafaro.
No, Garofa, Count of Garofa!
Who returned from America.
GAROFA!
5, 6, 7, 8, hop!
Hop!
No!
You have no class at all.
And lie... Can you lie?
It's very useful at the court.
Tell me a big lie.
To see if I believe you or not.
A really big one. Go on.
Yesterday morning, I found
300,000 ducats in the...
...coat tails of Monseigneur.
- What?
Where are they?
- Under my mattress.
Thief! Thief!
You robbed me.
No, Monseigneur, I lied to you.
Long live the King!
The King.
On the ground.
Put your hat on. You're a Spanish Grandee.
Grandees cover themselves for the King.
Ok, let's go.
Excuse me.
Don't excuse yourself.
The poor excuse themselves.
When you're rich, you're obnoxious.
Ok, let's go.
Una merveillosa!
This is what they call in Florence...
...una maquina infernale.
You're making fun of us, Giuseppe.
This ridiculous firecracker...
...wouldn't hurt a fly.
But later I multiply the explosion by a thousand...
...and the King of Spain, poof!
Gentlemen.
In a moment, the King will be dead.
One for all,...
...all for themselves.
But... What...
What's gotten into you?
I feel uncomfortable.
Can't we come back tomorrow?
I'm returning my Fleece today.
Not tomorrow.
And the Queen?
Do you want to get to know her?
Yes, but...
Well then.
No!
I said no.
What if they ask what I saw in America?
- Americans.
And with this...
You know who...
...will know who you are.
There.
The Infante.
Is that your fiancé, Monseigneur?
My compliments.
Little witch.
And not very well raised either.
In order to be introduced to the Queen,
I have to find somebody more popular.
A man who returns his Fleece...
- Ungrateful!
I spent all night transforming a worm into a nobleman.
Ill-bred!
Did you see that?
But where is he?
Where did he go?
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
Last night, I wasn't thinking.
I don't care.
Stay here.
And I'm wondering why you do all this for me.
No. I'd better go.
I order you to stay.
No, Monseigneur. That's enough.
Bow, scrape, stand, sit, lie, salute like this, talk like that...
...I've had enough.
- Shut up!
So, hello there, Marquis.
Oh you!
You're...
Yes, Monseigneur!
I'm ill-bred too.
Snap!
The King!
The Queen!
The exit...
...is it there or there?
Honourable Grandees!
Ouch!
Ouch!
Gentlemen,...
...cover yourselves.
And my money. Did you forget?
- You will be paid afterwards.
No! No money, no bomb.
- Shut up!
Listen, Giuseppe,...
...this is a promissory note.
No!
The other half after the explosion.
Start the mechanism.
Careful, it will explode in exactly 4 minutes and 30 seconds.
At the moment of the explosion, be at least 20 metres away from the throne.
My God, the Queen!
Quick, quick, Monseigneur.
The throne? Where's the throne?
- Over there.
Don Salluste,...
...Marquis of Montalégré.
Baron Del Pisco.
At the order of his Majesty...
...our beloved King...
You will retire in the monastery of Saint Ignacio...
...where you'll take a vow of chastity...
...and of poverty.
Oh no! Not poverty!
Sire?
Sire, Don Salluste awaits...
...the wise decision of your Majesty.
Don Salluste!
You're no longer worthy to be in our company.
As the Queen informed you...
...we're stripping you of your title of Knight...
...of the Golden Fleece.
It's heavy.
Enough, Salluste.
Look out!
What?
Careful! It's going to explode!
Careful, Sire!
The cushion! The cushion!
No!
It's Salluste!
It's Salluste!
He wanted to kill the King.
Arrest him!
There he is.
It's not true.
I was here.
I didn't move from here.
- Liar.
Salluste!
Salluste!
No, Sire. For once, it wasn't me.
I was here, praying.
Excuse me, your Majesty.
It's not him, it's him. Look.
Give back that piece of paper.
Look, Sire, this is the proof.
Quickly!
Who are you, sir...
...who just saved our life?
Well, your Majesty, I'm...
I, I, I, I...
I'm...
A nephew of mine, Sire:
Don César...
Count of Gafaro.
- Garofa!
Count of Garofa.
Who returned from America...
Where I saw many Americans.
Don Salluste.
Yes, Sire?
You have 5 minutes to disappear to the Puerta del Sol forever.
He really hates me.
What did you say?
- He hates me.
César!
That's you.
César, come here.
César, Von Garofa!
On your knees.
I hope you'll be more...
...worthy of it then your uncle.
Yes, Sire.
Congratulations.
To the Puerta del Sol!
You're little bomb, just now?
It wasn't set very well.
It exploded way too early.
But my big bomb, my big bomb over there...
...will explode a lot later.
And when it will, it will make a huge scandal.
I don't understand.
Never mind.
To the Berbers!
Paf!
Salluste, asshole!
I'll get you.
- Enough, César.
You told us this story 50 times.
Where are you from?
From Madrid.
The King sold me for 500 dinars.
The treasury is empty again.
Salluste, asshole!
There are big changes going on there.
Salluste is no longer in power.
It's César now, his nephew.
César! Damn!
But I'm César.
César.
- Sire?
How much is it going to be?
About 3 to 4 million ducats, Sire.
The "volontary" contribution of His Excellence, the Marquis Del Basto.
But, Sire, I don't understand.
The Del Bastos...
...haven't paid taxes for 300 years.
Well, there's always a start for everything.
And by which right?
- By divine right.
What are you going to do about it, my dear Del Basto?
Your Majesty.
And the next gentleman.
The rogue!
The rogue took 5 million from me.
I won't pay.
I will pay, gentlemen.
But I'll have the last laugh.
César?
Yes, Sire?
Why are your boots always more shiny then mine?
Because I polish them myself, Sire.
Yourself?
Wait, I'll show you.
It's very simple.
Give me your leg.
Excellencies: the Marquis of Priégo, the
Duke of Los Montès, the Duke of Sandoval.
Allow me?
Excuse me, Sire, but it's the only way.
See? Every morning.
Every morning?
- Yes, every morning.
Ok, give me your leg.
- No.
Yes, come on.
- Sire!
Sire, I can't agree.
The poor pay taxes, not the rich.
Exactly, that wasn't very fair.
Was it, Sire?
That's why we changed everything.
There's a lot less gold on the scales than before. Don't you think, César?
Yes, I think so too, Sire.
Excuse me!
There's almost nothing.
Ok, jump.
Let me down.
Let me down.
Come on, don't look like that.
Go, Brutus.
Your Majesty, I think...
Enough! My horse!
Come, I'll take you hunting.
Sire, the Queen!
She's waiting for you.
- Oh the Queen, the Queen!
Just tell her I'll see her tomorrow.
I'm going to kill 6 wolves and then I'll be back.
Let's go!
Doña Isabella?
No!
Por aqui.
Por aya!
Your Majesty. Don César.
Was wollen sie?
Madam, the King won't be back until tomorrow.
He was called away for urgent matters of state.
You is a bad liar.
Das ist sehr delikat.
Blindman's buff play with us...
...Don César?
Your Majesty.
A Queen of Spain does not play blindman's buff with a gentleman.
Wer sagt das?
Etiquette, Madam!
Für dieses mal vergessen wie die Etikette!
Blindfold the eyes of Etiquette.
What? But Madam... your Majesty, you really can't.
But really, your Majesty.
I'm here. Where are you?
Where are you, my little ones?
Por aqui, por aya!
Por aqui, Doña Juana!
Yo te tengo!
Si, si, si!
Un poquito mas, por favor!
Por aqui!
Ole!
Who did that?
Who dared?
I was pushed.
Who pushed me?
Ah, I'm drinking water.
I'm choking.
Madam!
Achtung!
Doña Juana!
No, no. Don't worry.
I drowned her.
The little brats.
They'll pay for this.
I need to talk to your Majesty.
Das ist streng verboten.
Chhh... Chhh...
What I'm doing is verboten.
To deceive you. To make you think
I'm somebody I'm not.
To accept favours from the King while I...
Was sagen Sie?
Ich verstehe nicht.
Here it is. My name is not César.
My name is Blaze.
I'm not the nephew of Salluste.
I'm his servant.
Ach... Valais!
You're Swiss!
And why Swiss?
Which Swiss?
Katastrophe! Die Alte!
Madam.
I don't know how...
- Don César!
Ah Madam, I have to tell you.
I love you!
You're so beautiful, so radiant, so glorious.
Yes, yes, yes.
I have longed for you for months.
You're not doing it on purpose.
You're so elegant with your precious eyes.
Your little feet.
Know you know everything.
And if you now want me to leave, I'll go.
But you crying, Madam.
Yes...
Don César!
There you are.
- Shhh!
My dear baron.
I wanted to talk to you...
...about my taxes.
You must understand that it's very hard for me to meet the requirements...
César.
I'll be yours, body and soul.
Whenever you want.
Here's my hand.
Why are you sighing, César?
I love you too.
Not so fast.
Little animal.
Monseigneur, what if they recognise you?
6 months in exile.
Everybody has forgotten about me.
Wait for me down by the city wall.
I'll join the procession.
Blaze will definitely be there. Go!
Hey, Blaze!
Is that you?
No.
Hey, César!
Is that you?
No, it's not him.
Guess why the minister isn't here?
He's with the King, as always.
You know what he made him do?
Yet another law.
Now, when you kill a servant, you have to declare it.
Blaze!
César!
- César! There's no doubt about it.
We must attack him in the back.
A conspiracy against Blaze?
They're going to ruin it for me.
I never thought we'd miss Salluste that old bastard.
At least, he only stole from the poor.
The safest way is poison.
Tomorrow is his birthday.
It's now or never.
We'll make him eat a big poisonous cake.
Idiot.
But it wasn't me.
Del Basto!
Sandoval!
Well? What time tomorrow?
3 o'clock at my place.
At 4, everything will be over.
Priégo!
Los Montès!
What? Paf!
That, hop!
Another conspiracy.
This time, they want to kill Blaze.
I absolutely have to prevent that or my plan will not work out.
The mute. The mute.
The mute.
And he's deaf too.
I'm listening.
You're talking too fast.
Repeat.
Don't shout like that.
I'm not deaf.
But I don't hear anything.
What's he saying?
Stay out of the conversation.
And you, continue.
Reforms.
He's introducing reforms.
That's why they want to make him eat the big cake.
No... Not to make him gain weight, idiot.
To poison him.
I have to stop him from eating it at any price.
But why?
Because, you idiot...
...because if they kill my poor little Blaze tomorrow, I can't make the King...
...catch them in the Queen's bed.
My servant cheating on the King, that will be my revenge.
For you, César, my best bull.
Look!
Look how fierce he is.
I put him under your name.
Priégo, 3 months ago, I took your gold.
Now you're offering me your best bull.
What does it mean?
It means, hombre, that I don't have any hard feelings.
Come with me. There are more suprises waiting for you.
Cyanide.
I caught you red-handed.
Animal! Oaf!
Rascal!
Wait a moment.
Come with me.
I'm taking you to Don Marquis de Priégo.
- No. Not the Marquis.
He'll have you flogged.
The guests will have fun.
No, listen, listen, listen, your cream...
...isn't sweet, it's salty.
Salty?
- It's salty.
It's sweet.
It's salty.
Yumm, yumm, yumm.
Go on, more.
The Marquis!
A lackey?
What are you doing, Monseigneur?
- Hide me and dance! Quickly.
You have some guts.
To bother me among MY friends...
...on MY birthday.
Enjoy your birthday. It's your last one.
- What?
Your birthday cake has been poisoned.
Eat as little of it as you can and gain some time. I'll look after the rest.
They're trying to kill me? Who?
- Your friends.
César!
There they are.
Tell me off.
Ok, César, are you coming?
Take that, villain!
And that, scoundrel.
Not so hard.
- Take that.
Ouch!
Enough!
César, come and cut your cake.
With pleasure.
I'm very touched.
Between friends, this is a delicate matter.
If there were less flies, it would be perfect.
It's true. It has to do with the weather.
I need to gain some time...
Ok, never mind.
There are not that many...
No, but look.
See how many flies there are?
Look, oh, look.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Don't move.
Look!
There it is.
It wants to taste my cake.
See?
She's dead.
How strange.
- What are you waiting for?
Cut your cake and eat it.
For such a fine cake...
...we need a fine knife.
Enjoy, gentlemen.
Treason.
Leave him to me.
Salluste!
Quickly. Over here.
There!
Silence.
- Death to him!
Gentlemen, I offer you an execution.
And not of the bull.
Hey!
Hey!
Ole!
Ole!
Ole!
Gentlemen, our turn.
Quickly!
Hurry! Hurry!
Thank you, Monseigneur, you saved me.
You are...
You are... erm...
You're my prisoner, come on.
- But, Monseigneur...
What's gotten into you?
Let go of me.
Dump him in there.
Monseigneur, how can you?
Shh!
Shhhh! Enough.
Enough now.
That's enough now, ok?
Look there.
The Queen's there...
Come on, cooperate or I'll pull out a feather.
The Queen's up there.
Window with balcony.
Look up there.
Very good.
Now repeat after me one last...
Are you listening?
Repeat one last time.
Go on, talk.
Tatatatalk! Go on! Go on!
Shit!
- Rude creature.
Considering what I paid you...
Don't repeat that.
Talk!
Tttttt! Talk!
Ok, now repeat after me.
César sent me.
Come on.
César sent me.
Very good. Perfect.
And what do you say next?
Yo te quiero.
Not in Spanish, in German.
She's German.
Ich liebe dich.
Ich li...
Ich liebe dich, go on!
Hop!
Here!
No, not that window.
What's it doing with the old woman?
What's it telling her?
César sent me.
César!
And what else?
Tomorrow evening?
In the Cabeza Negra inn?
He'll wait for you.
- He'll wait?
Jawohl, mein Lieber!
What's that noise?
It's so loud.
You made a mistake. Come here.
The Queen is there, up there. Go on.
Ist da jemand im Garten?
Ach! Was für ein schöner Papagei!
Speak!
Tell her.
Ich liebe dich.
Wirklich?
Ich bin sent by Don Césarrr!
Don César, are you zere?
Yo te quiero.
Stupid animal.
Wait until I get my hands on you.
Was für eine gute Idee!
Das ist ganz romantisch!
Don César, are you valling?
Nein, mein liebe, ich bin konfortabel!
Kommen Sie see mich... me...
Tomorrow evening,
The Cabeza Negra inn.
Ein rendezvous.
Das ist eine grosse folly.
Nein!
Little folly!
Can I count on you?
Count?
Count:
Ein, zwei, drei.
Ya, I'll be zere.
Ach, she'll be zere!
Gute Nacht, Don César.
Auf Wiedersehen!
An anonymous letter for the King.
An anonymous letter for the King.
Sire, you're too strong for me.
An anonymous letter for the King.
An anonymous letter?
Sire, your Majesty's a cuckold.
What? Me?
Yes, you.
The Queen's cheating on you.
With who?
With Don César.
The traitor.
The Queen's going to meet him this evening...
...in the Cabeza Negra inn...
...and in a moment, she'll come in and tell you...
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty, meine papa ill.
Going to Bavaria, can I? Bitte?
And when do you want to leave?
Tonight.
The sooner I leave, the sooner I'll be back.
Go, Madam.
And know that my thoughts will follow your every step.
Danke, mein geliebter König.
I don't understand it anymore.
You will understand.
Listen to me: you save me, you kidnap me, you tie me up...
...and you save me.
Why?
Mmm? Well?
Be careful.
What are you cooking up?
Old bastard.
I'll tell you.
So I clean up my pawn.
I'm cleaning my pawn..
Ok!
Look.
Remember that?
Oh no, no!
Yes! Yes! Oh yes!
It hurts.
Doesn't it hurt?
I put perfume on my pawn.
There!
I'm pampering my pawn.
I'm making it beautiful.
Irresistible.
Not happy?
Ok, finished. There. How beautiful.
Madam, look how beautiful he is.
That's 3 times.
In 40 years, never.
Today, 3 times.
Me, a Grandee, kicked in the butt...
...by a lackey.
A commoner's butt is as good as the butt of a Grandee.
But tell me...
But your head... it's enormous.
I'm going to have you arrested.
You're no longer minister.
I'm gagging my pawn...
Ho ho! Ho ho!
Mmh! Mmh!
And I'm calming my pawn.
Careful...
And finished.
Mute! One-eyed man!
Mute! One-eyed man!
Yes, Monseigneur?
- Still nobody? - No.
Open your eyes, you.
And you: hop!
Speak.
A mute! That's just my luck.
Ouch!
Don't look.
There's nobody.
Go on, go on.
Malaga.
Don't worry.
You're going to sleep well.
And later, in that bed, when you wake up...
...there will be a surprise.
Don't move.
I have to make myself beautiful too.
I'll be back in 5 minutes.
But who are you?
Don César.
The real one.
There's somebody.
Mi amor!
Mi tesoro!
Mi hombre!
Mommy!
The parrot told me everything.
Oh yes? But be still, there's somebody under the bed who can hear you.
Ah, this room, this love nest, the flowers, the dinner.
Oh, bite me again, little animal.
What if we drank...
...something first?
Big fool!
Are you trying to get me drunk?
You first.
- After you, Juanita. Mi corazon!
Monseigneur!
What is it?
What's happening?
The mute has been attacked.
Blaze! It must be him.
The old woman!
What's she doing there?
But who is she?
- The dueña.
But where's the Queen?
And Blaze, where is he?
He got away.
- He can't be far.
Ok, listen.
Go find him.
I need him in this bed right away.
Go!
You this way, me that way.
Let go of me.
Come here.
You're strong.
Love me.
No, I don't, come on.
What is that?
Go to sleep.
Who is it?
Ich bin es, Don César.
Ein Moment, bitte!
Kommen Sie, mein Liebling.
It's done, Monseigneur!
Shht!
I found him.
- Where is he?
I knocked him out and put him back in the bed, like you said.
Bravo!
Help me.
Ah! César, my nephew.
But you made a mistake, idiot.
But he's your nephew.
I sent him to the Berbers. I got money from them. I spent it all. All gone.
Where did you find him?
There, in the hall.
He escaped.
I'm going crazy.
Let's put him near the old woman.
Your Majesty, my Queen, mein Liebling.
You must wake up.
Wake up. Wake up quickly.
One!
Two!
Your Majesty, your Majesty.
- Ich liebe dich, César.
You don't understand
He wants us to be caught.
Küssen sie mich!
- What "Küssen sie mich"? Ah yes, kiss.
Yes, your Majesty, I'd like to. but this is not the moment...
I need Blaze.
But where is he?
There he is.
You said he wasn't there.
I don't understand.
There. Look.
She like this and he like that.
César, I love you.
On the ground.
César! César!
Come!
Your Majesty!
Search the house and bring everybody to me.
Come on, hurry.
Salluste!
What are you doing here?
Where's the Queen?
Did his Majesty receive my anonymous letter?
Where's the Queen?
Upstairs, Sire.
Let me show you.
Hurry.
Careful.
So we agree, don't we?
I did you a very big favour.
You repudiate the Queen and give me back my titles, my money, my Fleece.
Here we are.
Sire, you here?
Wake up, Juanita, my little angel. The King is here.
Oh, Sire!
Doña Juana, have you no shame?
Oh no, Sire!
And you?
Where's the Queen?
- The Queen, here?
She left for Bavaria, Sire. because of her father...
...who's ill.
That's why Doña Juana and I...
We used the opportunity.
Tell me, Salluste.
That's enough. You're in the room of a young girl.
Sire!
I'm no longer a young girl.
Marry us.
- No. Oh! Oh!
I mean...
I'll explain, Sire.
Let's wait and see.
There's nobody else. We searched everything. We only found these two.
Who are these two men?
Salluste!
Where is he?
Giddyup.
César.
Küssen Sie mich!
What did she say?
Kiss her, idiot.
Salluste!
Where are you going?
Nowhere, Sire.
I was looking for you, your Majesty.
Well, Salluste?
Am I a cuckold?
Wait!
Look who's coming.
Look who's there.
The Grandees.
I have the trendiest penal colony in the whole Sahara.
Anyway, we're not going to hang around here long.
I have a little plan to escape.
We're going back to Madrid.
We'll work together.
The King repudiates the Queen.
The old woman marries the parrot.
César becomes King.
I marry him...
...and then I'll be Queen.
Listen, Salluste, isn't your head becoming...
...very big sometimes?
Do you know what I mean?
But what are you doing here then, my dear César?
His name is not César.
It's Blaze.
The King said to me: "You can choose.
Either you marry Doña Juana...
...or you go to the Berbers.
And?
And the Berbers it was.
Yoho!
César!
Oh no!
The old woman!
César! César!
I'm here!
It's me!
Oh no!
Oh no, help!
Help!
César, wait for me, my love.

Huh?
[Knock At Door] Come in.
Party's ready to go, sir.
Oh!
What about the guest of honor?
Caruso went to tell him there's a fight in the galley.
That ought to bring him down.
Okay, Mac, he's coming.
Come on.
I said, vanilla!
I said, pistachio!
I said, vanilla!
Pistachio!
[All Shouting]
Knock it off! Hey!
What the hell do you men... think...
[Laughing] Oh, for Christ's sakes.
[Man Whistles]
- I'll have your ass for this, Caruso.
- I was only obeying orders, sir.
That's right, Dave. We just wanted you to know how we feel about you.
I gotta say, giving you this boat for your first command's... one of the few smart things that computer ever did.
You've been a good exec.
You'll make a hell of a skipper.
Hey, hey!
Let's hear it! Let's hear it!
This is, uh...
It's from all of us.
Nothing's gonna jump at me, is there?
Aw.
[Whistles]
Yeah!
All right!
[Blows Whistle]
I, uh... Well, for a fella who's never been at a loss for words,
I'd just like to say that, uh,
I'm at a loss for words.
I know just how to break this in though. Mm-hmm.
Monday I'll go pipe the new squadron commander into his swivel chair.
Oh, yeah.
Congratulations, Captain.

Just as a way of sort of wrapping this all up, I just wanna say...
[Man On Radio] Captain to the bridge.
 Gangway, Roberts. Move it!
Let's go ahead and get a fix, Larson.
 Aye, aye, sir.
Soundings, please?
Soundings, aye, sir.
Put the low pressure blower on all the main ballast tanks for 10 minutes.
[Blows Whistle]
Thanks, fellas.
What's up? Captain, we got a contact at 3-1-5 degrees,
3,000 yards on course 2-7-0.
That's a collision course with us.
I've come around to 3-1-5.
That ought to take us well astern of him.

Did we get off a radio signal?
We tried to, sir, but we may have been too far under.
Fathometer's reading a ledge or something.
[Captain] How deep? I can't tell, sir.
- We're sinking too fast.
- Thirteen hundred feet!
- We're going to hit it.
- We're gonna bottom out.
Grab something and hold on.
[Shouting]
Oh, Jesus!
[Groaning]
She's holding.
She's holding!
[Groaning Continues]
Are we gonna crush, sir?
I guess not.
[Sighs]
Fourteen hundred and fifty feet!
[Men Groaning]
They really built this baby.
Thank God.
God and General Dynamics.
High pressure air system holding?
Air holding, sir.
Have Engineering check it, and put a watch on it.
Yes, sir. I gotta find out how bad we're hurt.
Sir!
Get him up forward.
Visual check on that, chief.
Aye, aye, sir.
[Groaning Continues]
Get Doc in here.
He was... He was aft, sir, along with Kelly, Frazier and...
All right.
Get Page then. Anybody.
We got people hurt in here.
Aye, aye, sir.
This is the captain.
We're bottomed out on a shelf here... at 1,450 feet.
Looks like we're hurt pretty bad, but our hull is holding.
[Over Radio] The reactor's shut down.
Our engine spaces may be flooded,
but we have battery power
for most systems, including air.
Whoever hit us must have radioed, so by this time,
Norfolk has to know what's happened.
Help's probably already on the way.
So, what we do is, uh, sit tight till they get that rescue vehicle down on us,
then we all take an elevator ride.
That's all for now.
- Dave, I thought...
- Congratulations, skipper.
Identify her, Jim?
Looks like the Neptune.
She was the only sub in that area. What's the closest thing you've got to her?
An L.S.T., Nassau.
She's about 50 miles east of the collision point.
Well, move her in there.
Aye, aye, sir.
[Clicking]
[Phone Ringing]
[Woman] Hello? [Electric Shaver Whirring]
What?
Oh, just a minute.
Michael!
- Barnes.
- Sir, this is Cinclant fleet duty officer.
At 0532, a Norwegian freighter... rammed a sub 60 miles east of New London.
The sub which sank following collision... believed to be Neptune.
[Ringing]
- Yeah, Bennett.
- I need you on the double. Gray lady down.
One of yours.
Ten minutes.
List of the missing, sir.
Good God!
Fifty-two. It's more than...
I can read.
Sorry, sir.
[Groaning] Easy, easy. Easy.
You're bleeding.
[Chattering]
Captain, report on the damage.
All right, chief.
Let's just see what we got up forward first.
I've, uh, put Page in charge, sir. Fine.
He's the closest we've got to a medic.
We're lucky to have him.
Thank you, sir.
Phil, how are you feeling?
Pretty good, sir.
Yeah, that's a professional job.
Nothing to that.
Do you have any idea who hit us, Captain?
No, not a clue.
I'd sure like to break his ass.
I'll hold your coat.
Let's have a look at your patients.
Up this way.
Collins.
I've got most of the serious injuries up here.
Well, you think you can handle it all right?
Well, sir, I can handle the stitching, and I can handle the broken bones.
But we got three head wounds up here, and Richards is no good at all.
That ice pack's about all I can do for him.
How bad is he?
I can't tell without X-rays.
These men need to get to a hospital, but fast.
Do the best you can.
We really need you.
Yes, sir. Captain?
Uh, some of the men have asked for tranquilizers.
Just don't get my crew stoned on me, huh?
[Chuckles] Yes, sir.
Oh, chief, let's have it, huh? Here, sir.
We took it real hard in the stern.
It split right through.
All compartments were flooded.
But the bulkheads are holding this far down.
Don't ask me how.
Most of our air system is still intact too.
Most of it?
One of our purifiers is out, sir.
Forty-one men exhale a lot of carbon dioxide.
We'll be okay for maybe a day and a half.
We won't be down here that long.
Where's the storekeeper?
Hanson?
Here, sir.
How are we fixed for food?
We got plenty of food.
We got 100 chicken fricassees,
300 lime Jell-O...
I didn't ask for a menu.
No, sir.
Just give the men whatever they want whenever they want it, huh?
Yes, sir.
Okay, fellas. Coming through.
We have to assume they're somewhere in the area of that channel. Right, sir.
Or, if they've landed
in the canyon, it's all over.
If they've landed in the neck of it...
Can we get them out?
Maybe, sir.
What do you mean, Ben?
Have a look at this.
It so happens I'm fairly familiar with the area.
We've done sonar testing here.
Sinking old cars and tracking them all the way to the bottom.
Thank you. Ah.
Here's the neck of the canyon.
As you see, it's shaped like a trench.
Hopefully Neptune is located somewhere in this area.
But, Admiral, notice the slope of that trench.
It's nearly vertical.
Which causes gravity slides.
They're frequent, and they're very severe.
Even if she has bottomed out in this area, one large slide, and it's a two-mile ride to the bottom.
When will Nassau arrive there?
Not for a couple of hours, Admiral.
I want you to take charge of search and rescue, Ben.
We've got an aircraft waiting for you.
A D.S.R.V. will be flown to New London.
Should meet you about mid-afternoon.
Hopefully by then you will have established some kind of contact.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Your car is at the entrance, sir.
I'll be right there.
Yes, sir.
[Dialing Phone]
[Phone Ringing]
- Hello.
- Liz, it's Neptune.
Is Paul all right? I don't know.
I'm on my way there now myself.
Listen, do me a favor, will you?
Tell Vickie Blanchard yourself before they officially...
- Of course.
- And, Liz, tell her... whatever it takes, we'll get him out of there.
[Man On P.A.]
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
This is an emergency.
All Deep Submergence
Rescue Vehicle personnel,
prepare D.S.R.V.-1
for immediate departure.
A nuclear submarine

and prepare for immediate departure.
This is an emergency.
This is an emergency.
Any station, any station, this is Neptune. Over.
It's getting a little thick in here.
How are you coming with that purifier?
Forget it!
Caruso!
Sir, number two air purifier non-fixable, sir!
Get lost, Caruso.
"I'll fix it in one shot," I told him.
Any station, this is Neptune.
Neptune. Over.
- Captain, Page needs to see you, sir.
- Yeah, right.
Keep calling, Harris.
Any station.
Any station, this is Neptune. Over. Sir?
Recheck the hatches, chief.
Aye, aye, sir.
Where's Page?
Up there, sir.
What's up, Page?
It's Richards, sir.
I think he might go, sir.
You want me to move him?
Away from the others, I mean?
No.
What do you want me to do if he goes?
Cover him up.
?? [Flute]
Fowler's covering the control room, sir.
Yeah, I know that.
Where'd you learn to play the flute like that?
At home, sir.
Not easy to find a flute teacher in Nashville.
[Chuckles] They're pretty big on guitars down there, I guess.
Yeah. Do you think, uh, we'll ever get home again, sir?
- Hell, yes.
- My folks...
I'm, like, their, uh, fair-haired wonder.
Annapolis and all.
They're plain people.
They're just, um, very proud of me, sir.
Well, they're not gonna lose you, Danny.
Anything yet, Harris?
Nothing yet, sir.
Keep trying.
[Knock On Door] Come.
We're still tight, sir.
Uh, found this, sir.
Give me about five minutes, then ask him to come in here, will you?
Yes, sir.
Hey!
He's down, isn't he?
Any station, any station, this is Neptune. Over.
Oh, Dave.
It goes with a ship and a crew.
Yeah, so they tell me.
All yours, skipper.
Oh, wait a minute!
- We didn't have to surface.
- Dave...
But you just wanted
to ride into port up there.
Everybody look. Captain Friendly on the bridge for the last time.
[Chuckles]
- It's the last time, all right.
- Now, look.
You can either take a couple of aspirin and quit the bullshit or get yourself into sick bay.
I don't want any more...
[Rumbling]
Jesus Christ.
Any station, any station, this is Neptune.
Any station, any station,
this is Neptune. Over.
What is it, Captain?
[Rumbling Stops]
Gravity slide.
Check for damage.
Aye, aye, sir. Any station, any station, this is Neptune. Over.
Report all damage to the control room.
Where's the chief?
He's gone forward, sir.
I'll get him.
Answer me, goddamn it!
Why aren't any of you here?
Why aren't they here?
They don't fool me, man!
I know they can hear me!
Harris.
Why don't they hear? Why don't they hear me? Harris.
Let's get him forward into a bunk.
They're not fooling me.
Come on. They're not deaf. They're not deaf!
Take it easy.
Oh, wait.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Don't relieve me, sir. Don't relieve me.
It's okay.
I can watch... I can stand my watch.
[Grunts]
Better put someone on this. Right?
- Peña.
- Aye, sir.
Any station, any station, this is Neptune.
This is Neptune. Over.
Any station, any station, this is Neptune.
This is Neptune. Over.
Any station, this is Neptune.
Any station, this is Neptune. Over.
That's between us and the ocean.
The pressure on it must be unbelievable.
Six hundred pounds per square inch.
About 4,000 tons.
Built-in safety factor or not, we're pushing our luck in here.
Look at that.
It could give way anytime, sir.
Shouldn't we... evacuate the control room, sir?
We can't.
We need it, Danny.
[Man On Radio, Indistinct]
Captain. Station callingNeptune, say again.
You're very garbled and barely readable. Over.
What have you got?
Contact with a surface ship, sir.
The signal is very garbled, and I didn't get most of it, but I did hear "Neptune."
Stay on it.
This is Neptune.
This is Neptune. Over.
[Static]
Come in, anybody.
Is anybody up there? Over.

[Excited Chatter]
Knock it off.
Nassau, this is Neptune.
Are we ever glad to hear you.
Hello, Tom. Good morning, Captain.
Welcome to Nassau.
We have voice contact with Neptune.
 Very well.
Lieutenant Phillips.
Sir.
Notify Admiral Barnes in Norfolk immediately, and find out the current status of the D.S.R.V.
Phillips, get me the latest weather picture.
Then report to the operations center.
Aye, aye, sir.
Captain Blanchard standing by, sir.
Thank you.
Hello, Captain.
Hal Bennett here. Over.
[Blanchard On Radio] Glad to know it's you up there, Ben. Over.
What's your exact situation, Paul?
All compartments aft of the control room appear to be flooded.
The bulkhead's holding.
The reactor's shut down.
We're on battery power with 90% capacity.
We have adequate air for 36 hours.
Forty-one men accounted for.
Several casualties, some critical. Over.
What is your exact angle and depth? Over.
We're at 1-4-5-0 feet,
down nine degrees by the stern...
with a 10-degree starboard list.
Over.
Roger. Paul, we have an approximate fix on your location.
A D.S.R.V. is en route.
Estimated time of arrival: 1400.
Over.
See, I told you. Didn't I tell you?
Shut up! Shut up!
We'll be home for dinner!
Shh!
- How's your crew holding up, Captain?
- Just fine, sir.
I think we'd all like to get word to our families.
I understand. Have one of your men prepare a list of survivors.
I'll take care of it right away.
Over.
Roger. Out.
Now you can let it out.
[All Exclaiming]
Everybody out of the control room except necessary personnel.
The X. O?
Here.
Aye, sir.
All personnel not actually on watch, leave the control room.
All right, fellas.
Everybody out.
[Creaking]
Phillips?
Sir.
Do you see any problems with the D.S.R.V. here?
None so far, sir.
Right.
Bloome, any problems?
Sir.
No, sir. We can operate on any angle up to 50 degrees.
Fortunately, the Neptune is only listing 10 degrees, so we can attach without any problems, sir.
This matches up with the sub's forward escape hatch.
Sea pressure will keep us seated on her, allowing the hatches of both vessels to be opened...
Bloome, I don't need the whole lecture.
Yes, sir.
What about the currents, Phillips?
If this is the location of the sub, we have a fairly strong current in that channel.
One to three knots.
Weather forecast?
Uh, clearing, sir.
Seas, three to five feet.
Uh-huh. Oh.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I don't know if he's very smart or very dumb.
I think he's gone under the boat.
Hey, put your gloves on...
[No Audible Dialogue]
Hey!
[Men Groaning, Shouting]
- No sound!
- Hey, there's no sound out here!
? ? [Humming Theme From Jaws] Come on!
Can't hear!
?? [Humming Continues]
Ohh, look at that!
Here he comes.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
[British Accent] I'll catch that mother, or my name ain't...
[Man, High-Pitched Voice]
Oh, stop being so aggressive.
[Men Laughing]
Hey, I think I'm gonna throw up.
[Laughing Continues]
Uh, did somebody ring
the dinner bell up here?
[Laughing] [Rumbling]
Hey, what's going on? What is it? Hey!
What's going on in here?
[Men Chattering]
[Chattering Continues]
Secure all watertight doors.
Secure all watertight doors.
Secure all watertight doors.
Secure the...
Hey, that door!
Dave, flood the ballast tanks.
That might settle us.
Flooding the ballast tanks.
[Rumbling Stops]
[Men Groaning, Chattering] Give me a hand.
Sit him up.
[Groaning Continues]
Bring him on in.
Slow down.
Easy, easy.
Okay. Watch it, watch it, watch it.
Nassau. Nassau, are you still reading us? Over.
Roger.
We've had a gravity slide here.
A severe gravity slide.
Get Captain Bennett on the horn.
[Groaning Continues]
That's it.
Hello, Neptune. This is Captain Bennett.
Do you read me? Over.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. We must have had an avalanche down here.
- I don't know what's on top of us.
- Paul, listen to me carefully.
We've got to know how much of your hull is covered, particularly the escape hatch.
Make a manual test.
Repeat, manual test. Over.
Roger. Out.
[Page] Let me have a big bandage out of that case.
Cover him up good.
Here's a bandage.
If that hatch is covered up, sir...
Keep your fingers crossed.
[Tapping]
[Tapping Continues]
[Sighs]
Captain Bennett.
Thank you.
[Blanchard On Radio] Ben, we're socked in.
Manual test confirms it.
The escape hatch
seems to be completely buried.
Mud, rocks, God knows what.
Over.
Situation understood, Paul.
Informing Norfolk immediately.
Paul, I promise you, we will find a way to clear that hatch.
Roger. Out.
[Chuckling]
Oh, yes.
They will find a way.
Bill.
Michael.
Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Lieutenant.
Admiral Williams.
Captain.
Excuse me.
They're all here, Mr. Secretary.
Fine. Gentlemen, will you come in, please?
Mr. Secretary, Admiral Barnes. Hello, Admiral.
It's good to see you.
How are you? Captain Skinner.
Captain Skinner.
I wouldn't have called you away,
Admiral, but I feel it's imperative... that we all be briefed on this.
Yes.
Please, please, sit down.
I understand the ship is resting now below its crush depth.
Yes, sir, it is, but the hull seems to be holding.
How much deeper can she go and still survive?
Who can say? A few hundred feet might finish her.
If that happens, what are the chances of a nuclear accident?
Crushing will not cause a nuclear accident, sir.
There'll be no radioactive seepage.
The system design will not allow that to happen, sir.
Thank you, gentlemen.
How much time do we have?
Maybe 30 hours.
If nothing changes.
What do we have that will clear that hatch, Bill?
We have a small submersible...
It's a little bug, but it might just do the job.
It was developed on a shoestring budget.
The man that designed it claims it'll do most anything.
It has an arm, and I believe it's television-equipped, isn't it?
Yes, I think so.
It's supposed to do a lot of things, and clearing the earth off an escape hatch could certainly be one of them.
Let me emphasize, sir, it's still experimental.
It's called the... the Snark?
- Can we get it?
- Absolutely.
That is, if the secretary will authorize it.
I think Don Gates should go along with it.
He's the young captain who's developed it.
All right.
I'll authorize it.
[Horn Blaring]
[Horn Honking]
Captain Gates!
Captain Gates!
Hey, sir!
You got a call from the office of the Secretary of the Navy.
Hello!
A sub is down.
They wanna use the Snark.
Hey, partner, how's that arm?
Doing better, sir.
How you feeling? Fine?
Captain?
Harris.
How you doin'?
I, uh, don't know what happened up there.
You just did what we all felt like doing.
Yes, sir.
Take it easy.
Hey, how are you?
How you doin'?
Captain, can I speak to you a moment, sir?
What's up?
Is that, uh, whatchamacallit here yet?
Not yet.
It should be along anytime.
Lieutenant Fowler's gonna help you figure out a procedure... to get these people through here to the escape hatch.
You think it can dig us out, sir?
Captain Bennett thinks so.
Do you think so, sir?
Yeah, I do.
Have Lieutenant Bloome report to me on the helo-deck immediately. Aye, aye, sir.
Captain Gates? Hal Bennett.
Welcome aboard.
Don Gates.
Just secure her for now.
We'll dive in 20 minutes.
Can you show me to the com shack?
Aye, aye, sir.
Right this way.
Mickey? Everything working okay? Sir.
Yeah. You wanna, uh, set this up?
Certainly. Excuse me.
Oh, uh, these... will have to go.
Here, take these.
Okay.
We don't have power yet.
What I need is 110, AC.
Do you need this cable?
Yeah. Right over there, chief.
TV monitor, talk back.
This'll be able to see everything the Snark can see.
Get this set up, and before you know it,
you and me will be down at the bottom of the sea with that submarine.
You betcha. [Bennett] Captain Gates.
Captain Gates?
I think we'll operate more efficiently if we bear in mind who's in charge here.
Yes, sir.
The Snark is a two-man vehicle.
Is that correct?
Yes. I work it with Mickey here.
This is Lieutenant Bloome, Gates.
- You'll be working with him today.
- What?
Have a good look at the controls in that thing before you go down.
Aye, aye, sir.
Just a minute.
Captain Gates, Lieutenant Bloome is a submersibles expert.
- He's one of my team here.
- This is a unique vehicle.
There are no experts.
There's me and Mickey.
He planned it with me, built it for me.
Sir, you see...
Look, this is not a town meeting.
I said you will take Bloome.
He knows these waters.
When will you be ready to dive?
We'll dive in 45 minutes.
Bloome.
Sir, would, uh...
Excuse us, gentlemen.
Okay, Bloome.
Now, you're down here
on your belly like this.
To operate the nose camera and the light, they're both in sync, so wherever you point the light, the camera goes there too.
- How about the mechanical arm?
- It works just like a crane.
Uh-huh.
Pull it back to retract it.
See the stick?
Mm-hmm.
Side to side.
Nothing hard about it.
How in the hell do you stay so calm?
You know, I had this funny flash when we were bottoming out, sir, that, uh, I didn't give a damn one way or the other.
Hit me just the opposite.
Hit me just how much
I wanted to stay around, especially with this boat and this crew.
Only yesterday I was thinking, it's all over, isn't it?
All set, Captain?
All set.
Lieutenant, you understand this contraption?
Yes, sir. It's not all that different from our own R.V.-1.
Just remember, any problems, you notify us immediately.
Two dead heroes won't help anyone.
Listen, don't try to take off too much in one bite.
Let's hit it.
Good luck.
Bye.
Snark, do you read me? Over.
Snark, do you read me? Over.
Snark, do you read me? Over.
Of course I do.
Have you got it?
Yes, sir.
No problems so far.
Two hundred feet. [Bennett On Radio] Roger.
[Gates On Radio]
Two hundred and fifty feet.
Two ninety-five.
Three hundred and forty feet.
Water temperature, 48 degrees.
Passing 400 feet.
Looks good, Mickey.
What's his angle of descent?
Snark, what is your angle of descent? Over.
[Gates] Ten degrees, increasing one degree every 150 feet.
[Rattling]
Uh, 525 feet.
Uh, there's a little vibration.
Nothing to worry about, Bloome.
[Chuckles]
Coming up on 600 feet.
That shouldn't bring him down very far off, sir.
Not too fast.
Go on your sonar now.
Passing 1,000 feet.
Go on.
We're turning on the cameras and going on sonar.
[Beeping Slowly]
[Beeping Continues]
[Bloome] There she is.
We have a sonar contact.
[Rumbling]
Do you read us up top?
We're taking a little beating down here.
Current layer, sir. We're expecting...
That's okay. Yeah, it's fine.
Look, sir, as long as it doesn't go too heavy, you know?
Gates, this is Bennett.
Hold on till you get beneath that layer.
[Chuckling] Okay, Captain.
We're gonna hold on.
Uh-oh.
We've lost contact.
That layer must be deflecting your sonar.
Decrease your rate of descent.
You'll have to make contact visually.
Coming up on 1300 feet.
Seems to be settling down.
Neptune, are you getting all this?
We hear it.
Just take a little longer, that's all, Paul.
 We'll be here.
You heard the man.
Relax.
[Sighs]
Relax. Yes, sir.
Are you relaxed?
Yeah, I'm... We're relaxed.
I'm relaxed.
We are relaxed.
Coming up on 1400 feet.
[Beeping Intensifies]
And my sonar is saturated with reverberations.
Captain, there it is!
Down a little.
Wait a second.
I think I see it.
Damn, it's hard to see.
Damn light reflections!
There. That must be it.
Hard to starboard.
Do you see her?
[Gates] Yeah, Bloome thinks so.
We're moving in for a closer look.
We can't be this far off.
Easy.
In a little closer.
Little closer.
There. I do see it.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Sorry, Paul.
What we thought was you turned out to be an old sonar target.
[Gates]
Captain Bennett, I'm taking it back up.
[Bennett] How far? All the way.
[Bennett] We'll try again, Paul.
Roger.
Captain Gates?
What happened?
Why did you stop looking for her?
I gotta have my own man down there.
And you thought that's sufficient reason to abandon the search?
When I'm steered to a '52 De Soto, yes, sir.
It's not your fault.
You'd really get the hang of it... after a week of lyin' on your belly lookin' through those little peepholes.
But we haven't got a damn week!
We haven't got time for this either, Gates. I'm sorry.
You have dived nowhere but Nantucket Sound in that...
Contraption.
No, sir.
Captain, Lieutenant Bloome is an expert in these waters.
He knows the currents, he knows the rock formations.
I don't mean to argue, but, please, we can dig those guys out.
Gates, how can you be sure... that this man is even physically fit for the job?
Mickey, show him your muscles or somethin', will ya?
I really can handle it, sir.
No kidding.
[Man On P.A.]
Sir, Pigeon and D.S.R.V. approaching.
Lieutenant Phillips,
advise Neptune she's here.
Aye, aye, sir.
There's our rescue vehicle, Gates.
We don't wanna keep her waiting, so get back in your machine and do what you were sent here to do.
- Can I take my chief with me?
- Take Little Orphan Annie if you need to.
Sir, we've lost communication with Neptune.
Can you fix it?
I don't know.
I'm gonna have to get behind this control panel.
Oh, goddamn it.
What are we gonna do, sir?
Even if they do get to the hatch now, how are we gonna know when...
How do I know?
All I know is I'm beginning to feel like a one-legged man... in an ass-kicking contest.
Are you supposed to be here?
Well, uh...
Lieutenant, you on watch?
No, I'm not on watch.
Then get out!
Yes, sir.
What'd you call me?
"Captain Friendly"?
Look, Paul, whatever I said back there...
Let it go.
- Mickey!
- Coming, sir!
I want those back shined.
Let's go.
[Chuckles]
Cables are free, sir.
How deep was that current layer?
Eleven hundred feet.
Only lasted for a couple of hundred, but it sure scared the hell out of me.
Well, at least this time we know it's comin'.
[Bennett On Radio] Snark, this is Bennett.
Do you read me? Over.
Roger, Mother Hen.
This is Baby Chick.
I roger your transmission.
How me?
Oh, give me a shot, will ya?
Sorry, buddy.
There's none left.
[Groaning]
Hey, Jackson.
Hey.
Hey, why don't you hold this for me? Sure.
Thanks.
What would you have done?
What?
Well, if you were on the bridge and you had radar contact on a collision course...
Danny... I said notify me at 3,000 yards.
Danny, what are you talkin' about?
Well, I can't help thinking...
What-Whatever it is, forget it.
Yes, I know...
Forget it, okay?
Yeah. Sure.
Here, give me a hand.
There you go.
Feels like we're coming down on the layer.
I'm gonna try to drop it through faster this time.
Okay.
Whew.
[Chuckles]
Slowing. Slowing.
Very nice.
Get on the camera.
All right.
Sonar. Camera.
Have you got anything on your monitor?
[Bennett On Radio] Nothing yet.
Do you have sonar contact?
Sonar contact?
We got nothin' but sonar contact.
Reverberations off these mountains down here.
We don't have a reading on that, chief.
Why, you no-good, rotten, complicated son of a...
All right, that's not gonna help.
I'll be damned if I know what's wrong with it, sir.
Get the wiring diagram.
Right, sir.
Yeah, and a nine-pound sledgehammer.
I know how you feel, chief.
Huh?
Yeah. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Complicated...
Come right about 10 degrees.
A little more.
Bennett, do you see her?
We've found her.
[Gates] Do you see her?
All right. Yes, we do, Gates.
Congratulations.
Jesus Christ!
Are you picking this up?
It's a miracle anybody's alive in there.
Try them again.
Neptune, do you read?
Neptune, do you read?
Over.
Neptune, do you read?
Neptune, do you read? Over.
We'll attempt to make contact.
[Banging]
Sounds like somebody locked in the head.
[Banging Continues]
That came from outside.
They're on the deck.
[Tapping Morse Code] Shh!
"Will clear escape hatch for D.S.R.V."
How about that?
I hope they understood it.
If I did, they did.
Okay, I'm gonna lift her off now.
Okay.
And no physical movement unless it's absolutely essential.
We do have reserve air in the high pressure system, but we've gotta conserve it.
We don't know how long this is gonna take 'em.
I think they're using chopsticks up there.
Why don't you belay that, chief?
Well, it's good occupational therapy.
[Rumbling]
We're gettin' low on juice.
We need a recharge.
Go on auxiliary.
Listen, if we do that, we're all...
Just do it.
We can't go up now.
We'll be finished in half an hour.
Finished is the word, boy.
Pigeon Control, do you read me?
This is Captain Bennett. Over.
[Man On Radio]
Have you loud and clear. Over.
The second I say "go," we want D.S.R.V. underway. Is that understood? Over.
This is Pigeon. Roger.
We'll be ready. Out.
Come on. Come on.
I'm just checking this power supply.
Just keep goin'.
[Sighs]
[Rumbling] Earth slide!
Bennett, earth slide!
Pull her back!
It's getting worse. [Bennett] We're reading it here. Bring it up!
No. We've gotta see what happens to the sub.
[Men Shouting]
Captain!
Captain, we're goin' over!
[Chattering, Groaning]
Holy Christ!
Look how we're lyin'.
[Murphy] They'll never get to us now!
 Fowler, check for damages aft.
How much more can we take?
I said check for damage, mister!
Aye, aye, sir.
Murphy!
Get a detail to help up here.
If there's any people hurt back there, move 'em forward. Aye, aye, sir.
Come left a little.
That's it. Steady up.
[Gates] Are you getting this?
Yes. At that angle, the D.S.R.V. can't hook up to her, even if they're still alive.
I'll go and find out. [Bennett] Roger.
Have we got anything left here, Dave?
Not much, sir.
Captain.
Page got 'em all on mattresses, sir.
That's all he can do.
All right.
What else?
I don't know.
I will be damned if I know what else.
If we could just... apply some high school physics here.
If we could... shift our balance, then we'd come up right, or at least upright enough... to get at that escape hatch.
Our ballast tanks are above us and below us now, right?
Both of 'em full of water.
Right.
We can still reach the emergency bypass valves.
We could... blow the starboard tanks.
That'd let the weight of the water in the port tanks roll us over.
It's worth a try.
I like it.
What if we can't control how far we roll?
And when we blow the tanks, we blow our reserve air.
That's right. And we don't know if it would even work.
It's pure theory.
We don't have many options.
Any.
[Pounding]
[Chuckles] The Avon lady.
We gotta signal 'em what we're gonna do.
McAllister, bring that wrench.
Yes, sir.
[Tapping Morse Code]
[Tapping Stops]
Jesus H. Christ.
Okay, here it is.
It's not too good.
They're down to 37 men now.
The hull and the bulkheads
are still holding.
Their angle is precisely 70 degrees.
7-0.
Roger.
Hey, there's more.
Blanchard thinks that if he blows his starboard tanks,
the boat may right itself enough so that...
the D.S.R.V. can mate up
with the escape hatch.
Only thing is, he's not sure
whether the tanks are ruptured or not.
Also, he has to use
all his reserve air to blow them.
Over.
Roger. Bring the Snark up.
Sir, we'd just as soon stay down here with them.
[Bennett] That won't be necessary, Gates.
Sir, we've seen it through this far.
I really think we should stay with it.
We'll come up to 1300 feet, okay?
Gates?
Gates?
Gates?
What's all this "we" stuff?
I don't wanna hurt your image.
Think it'll take it?
[Sighs]
Let's go. I don't want anybody else in there when I open those valves.
Come on. Everybody out.
Commander.
Come on!
- I'll do it!
- Murphy!
Dave, get out!
Danny, get outta there!
I can't!
I gotta hold these open!
Come on!
Clear out, Paul!
It's too heavy!
You'll never close it from that side!
Help me, you son of a bitch!
Come on, Paul!
[Chattering, Shouting]
[Bennett] Gates, is it working?
Yeah. Yeah, it's turning.
It stopped!
Damn it!
Do you see that, Bennett?
That rock's stopping her.
Yes. She's caught there.
That angle doesn't look good.
No less than 60 degrees.
It won't work.
We're coming up.
What the hell happened?
It's all right.
We-We-We just stopped.
I don't understand right now.
Something's holding us back.
Well, what is it, Captain?
Take it easy.
Sir, what happened back there, sir?
Captain, what happened back there? Captain?
How much air do you calculate they've got left?
No more than 10 to 12 hours, sir.
Gates?
That mechanical arm on the Snark...
it's fairly versatile, isn't it?
Can it handle explosives?
Handle?
Carry them? Place them?
I guess so.
I was thinking, if we could blast away just a section of that rock, there'd be no more obstruction.
The sub would roll upright, and the hatch would be cleared.
Captain, your explosion would cave in the whole submarine.
There would be no one left to rescue.
Not if we use shaped charges.
You see, the blast from a shaped charge... goes only in one direction.
We could rig it so that it would blow away from the submarine.
- We have no demolitions team.
- We can get one.
Sir... Don't touch it, chief. It's live.
Okay, Captain.
What you wanna do is very dangerous.
I mean, we're takin' a live charge down that's all ready to blow, and it can damn sure go off when we place it.
Will it be ready soon?
Yes, sir.
But, listen, if it's not placed just right, we're gonna put one hell of a hole in that sub.
Well, then, we'll have to place it just right, won't we, Lieutenant?
I'm with you, sir, but I'm here to tell you... it's kind of tricky when you got earth slides and currents.
You're using a mechanical arm.
Lieutenant, I know you can do it.
After you.
Yes, sir.
Three's a crowd, huh?
Watch it on television, Mickey.
Everything set? Gates, the men have gotta know what's happening down there before the blast.
Can you signal them?
They're not gonna believe it.
I'm not sure I do myself.
Hey!
What the hell's that?
What's goin' on? Hey, the batteries...
It's the batteries.
Hey, come on! Put the lights on!
[Voices Overlapping]
All right, fellas, knock it off.
Light the battle lanterns.
Light the battle lanterns.
Here, Danny, hold this.
Comin' through, fellas.
Watch your head, sir.
[Man] You're on my feet. Well, it...
There we go.
All right, hand me that one.
Yeah.
Here you go.
The air's kind of stale already.
You starting to feel drowsy?
[Sighs] Yeah, maybe a little, sir.
[Thumping]
Collins, gangway.
[Tapping Morse Code]
Harris, you getting this?
Yes, sir.
What are they doing, sir?
They're gonna blast away the rock that's keeping us over at this angle.
That'll let us right ourselves.
Then comes the D.S.R.V.
[Chuckles]
Simple.
They've flipped out.
All right. Take it easy.
Now, listen.
Everybody keep alert.
Really on your toes. That's gonna be one hell of a big shock wave hitting this boat.
I don't think the door of that control room back there'll hold.
Chances are we'll lose the next compartment here too.
Maybe it'll act as a cushion.
All right, secure all loose gear.
Do what you can to protect the injured men.
Remember, the boat will roll to port.
Captain, do you really think this'll work?
[Chuckles] Caruso, what can I tell ya?
It'll either work or blow us to kingdom come.
All right.
Now move it right up so the base is flush against that rock.
Easy, Gates.
Why doesn't he shut up?
Yeah. I'm nervous enough as it is.
You're doing great for an amateur.
Thanks, Captain.
I needed that.
[Sighs] Let's get the hell out of here.
Oh, yeah.
That really gets the adrenaline going.
[Chuckles] We all set?
Yeah. All I have to do now... is push that little plunger up there.
Okay. Bennett, we're comin' up.
All right, stand by to bring Snark aboard.
Charges will be detonated right after its arrival.
Pass the word to D.S.R.V. They will prepare to launch one minute after that. Aye, sir.
Now all hands stand alert...
on D.S.R.V. launching stations.
Be prepared to launch on command.
Personnel, take their positions
and await launching signal.
Here we go.
That's it. That's it.
That's it. Come on. Bring her down.
Be ready with the ladder.
Standing by to transfer you to Pigeon, sir. Thank you.
Do you operate this?
No, sir. Only the lieutenant.
Thanks, Waters.
Bennett, I'm goin' back down.
[Bennett] Gates? I have to.
How else are we gonna know?
All right.
But go easy, will you?
Don't get too close, Captain.
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
Come on. Come on.
I gotta get in there first.
Two's a crowd this time, Mickey.
Now, wait a minute.
Just hold it!
Take her down.
Sir!
All right, let's go!
Both the D.S.R.V. and Snark on this?
Aye, sir.
D.S.R.V., this is Bennett.
Stand by.
Roger. Standing by to launch.
Gates, give yourself a safe margin.
So long as I can see her.
1300, Gates.
That's close enough.
Make it 1400.
I'll throw in an extra pair of pants.
Okay, brace yourself.
Hold on tight.
Get a good grip.
Here we go.
[Sighs]
All right.
Come on.
[Gates] I got her, Captain.
[Bennett] Yes, we see her.
Prepare to detonate.
Waters, this is Bennett.
Stand by for countdown.
Fifteen seconds from mark.
Fourteen, thirteen,
twelve, eleven,
ten, niner, eight,
seven, six,
five, four,
three, two, one.
Execute!
Come on, make it work!
Come on!
It's gotta work!
Come on!
It's going over the edge.
Gates!
No! No! Goddamn it, no!
It's working.
It's working!
They're holding firm.
Launch the D.S.R.V. [Man On Radio] Roger.
Launching underway.
Page, that compartment's flooded, right?
It sure is, Captain.
Let's start getting the badly injured men up to the escape hatch.
They'll be the first ones out. Come on.
Move it. They'll be here any minute.
Captain, can I take my camera, sir?
Caruso, no personal belon...
Oh, stick it in your shirt.
Come on. Come on.
Be gentle.
One at a time.
One at a time.
That's it. Be careful.
[Chattering Continues]
You the fella that called for a bucket of chicken?
Yeah. What took you so long?
Hand down the oxygen.
Tell them to move it.
Not too stable here.
Hook those up down there.
All right, shoes off, everybody.
Let's move it. We haven't got all day.
Come on, guys.
Caruso, give me some help.
Fowler, you're in the first load.
But, sir, I think I should be...
All right, knock it off.
That's an order.
Yes, sir.
Easy, son.
Come on. Come on!
Watch his ribs.
[Blanchard] All right.
Keep it moving.
I got ya.
Come on.
Take it easy.
[Man] Man, move it! Come on! Move it!
Pigeon Control, come in.
Over. Pigeon Control.
[Man]
We read you. Over.
Captain Bennett here.
Is the first load coming up yet?
This is Pigeon. The first load of rescuees to board the D.S.R.V., they're lifting off at this time.
[Bennett] Roger.
Let's go!
Okay, let's get those stretchers in here!
Coming through there!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
[Cheering]
[Gates] What about the injured, Captain?
[Bennett] They've all been removed and are being taken care of. Over.
[Gates]
How about the D.S.R.V.?
[Bennett] It's in good shape, Gates.
Everything's on schedule. Over.
[Gates] When will it launch?
[Bennett] It submerged a few minutes ago.
[Gates] Good.
[Bennett] Conditions holding down there?
[Gates] For the moment.
D.S.R.V. in sight.
Let's go, Captain.
All right, hit it.
Let's go. Move it.
She's slippin' off.
Hanson, don't stop! Keep moving! Yes, sir.
Over the ledge.
That's it.
Move it out, boys.
Keep it movin'.
Close it up there.
That's the stuff.
D.S.R.V., get out, fast!
[Blanchard]
All right. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on! Make it!
Come on! Come on!
What are you doing, sir?
It stopped.
Something's holding us. Let's go!
Get outta there!
He can't hear you, sir.
Excuse me. Gates...
[Continues, Indistinct]
[Bell Ringing]
[Man Over P.A.]
Neptune arriving.
Paul.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Thank you.
Congratulations, sir.
Thanks.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Thanks.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Thank you.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
Thank you.
Welcome aboard, sir.
Thanks.
What is it? What is it?
My head! My head!
Are you mad?
Or do you wish my son dead?
No, madam. I love him.
I know that what you would have done is stupid and reckless.
Don't touch him!
I forbid you to hurt him!
O Majesty!
Uncle.
Be patient my child.
The doctors maybe trusted with the life of the king.
It is his third attack in a month.
He may well die of this illness.
We would be stupid not to consider it, and your fate upon us if he does.
He will not die.
I will not let you talk of it.
Oh, yes, you will, Mary.
I shall be plainer than my brother.
We of Guise, the family of de Guise, have all finished.
If François dies, and there is no child of your body...
I will not think of life without him.
You must.
You are Queen of Scotland by birth and Queen of France by marriage.
And the Queen of England by right.
Elizabeth is bastard and has no right to the throne of England
A woman who consorts with her horse master
Beautiful, Robin.
Beautiful.
You write songs as well as you sing them.
Your Majesty, the composer of such a melody rises far above my poor talent.
I came across the tune when I was looking through some old manuscripts at the Greenwich Place.
I thought it might amuse you to hear it.
Well, who wrote it?
It is said that your father composed it for you blessed mother, Anne Boleyn, before they were married.
Oh.
It is also said that when he asked her how she liked it, she countered by asking him how his wife liked it.
By God, my mother had the courage of ten, and so have you, you horse.
A message for the Queen.
Message for the Queen.
From Sir William Cecil, my lord.
Your wife has been found dead.
Of a broken neck at the foot of a staircase.
I grieve for you,
Lord Robert.
Lady Dudley was alone in her house.
There is talk of murder.
You will leave the court at once and not return until I send for you.
Now will the great scandal begin.
Now will my enemies rejoice.
What do your spies at court say the Spanish ambassador made of this news?
He remained silent.
And the French ambassador?
He exults.
And says?
And says?
That soon he will see Mary
Stuart on the English throne.
"For not even the Protestant
English will support
"the bastard and usurper, Elizabeth, when she marries her horse master, Dudley,
"who has killed his wife to make room for her."
He is innocent.
Let him prove it.
When I was in great danger in my late sister's reign he did not desert me.
Your Majesty, you are in great danger now, from Mary Stuart and the Catholic cause.
Mary Stuart? She's safe in France for a lifetime.
Is she?
They say her husband has fevers of the brain.
If he should die, what direction would Mary turn?
Remember, her mother rules as regent in Scotland.
Mary Stuart's mother does not rule in Scotland, she tyrannizes Scotland with the French army.
She forces the Catholic faith down Scottish throats.
Half her nobles are Protestant and in open rebellion rule, you say.
She barely survives.
I fear neither Mary Stuart in France nor her mother in Scotland.
Nor your own Catholic nobles who live in the north, hard upon the Scottish border?
Why should I?
They are not persecuted.
I am no tyrant.
Scotland is the backdoor to England.
It must not be unbarred by a scandal in the English court.
If you protect Lord Robert Dudley and seem to condone a murder, the Northern lords are going to believe that next you will marry him.
The rumor is everywhere.
They are certain to rebel.
Bring him to trial in open court, hide nothing.
It hurts! It hurts! It's like burning arrows in my brain.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Please, François, come in.
Please.
No, no, no, no.
I will ride from the pain.
It goes when I ride.
Please!
No, no. I must!
François, please!
François!
François!
Bring me a chair.
Please, come back inside,
Your Grace.
I must keep vigil for the king.
Almighty God, if you love
François more than I do, then take him to you, but take me as well for I have no wish to live without him.
Your Majesty.
Who's there?
A Scottish lord.
Lord Bothwell, emissary from your brother,
Lord James Stuart, regent of Scotland.
James?
No, my mother is regent.
Madam, you mother is dead.
Your mother is dead.
No!
I'm sent ahead by your brother to prepare you.
Whatever James Stuart says to you, remember this, madam, there is terrible disorder in your land.
The clans already fight for power.
This is my land.
You are needed in Scotland, madam.
François!
François!
CATHERINE DE MEDICl: Enough!
Against my will, my son married her.
Now, he's dead.
She's the cause.
Oh, no.
I'll rule here, until my second son is of age.
If you defy me, my lords, I will not only banish her from the court,
I will exile her from France.
Brother, help me.
What must I do?
You were always so kind to me, when we were children together.
Tell me what to do now, James.
Mary, if you wish it, I will take you home to Scotland and there you will rule as the rightful Queen.
You have no need of foreign marriages or armies.
But would I be happy? Will the people of Scotland love me?
Tolerate the new religion, Your Grace, and they will give you their hearts.
She shall not.
Uncle, I must.
I cannot live out my years in exile,
I must believe there is hope for a new life in Scotland.
Will you help me, my lords?
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
My lords.
The usurper Elizabeth will be my neighbor, yes?
She will.
Well, then, I will make a new beginning with her as well as my
Protestant subjects.
I will travel to Scotland through England.
I will go to the court of Elizabeth, and win her friendship.
Never.
I would have no dealing with that lady, and I will use force if I must, to stop her returning to Scotland.
That is unwise,
Your Grace.
Explain.
Because, Your Majesty, if we do not bring her to Scotland, subservient to a Protestant court, she will soon arrive with a Catholic army at her back.
Her uncles will see to that.
If that happens, she'll soon be knocking on the back door.
And what will prevent her doing that now?
Are the Protestant lords of the congregation in Scotland so devoted to me?
Well, madam,
I am first amongst them and I am devoted to peace and order in our two lands.
Once we have her safe in Edinburgh there is no further danger.
Mary Stuart will rule in name,
I will rule in fact.
If you value my friendship you will keep that promise.
Then she shall come home.
Yes.
But not through my realm.
Duc de Guise, madam.
Uncle François!
Mary.
Is it from Elizabeth?
She refuses me safe conduct through England.
She hates me.
She fears you.
She says, "Renounce your claim to the English throne."
You renounce nothing, neither your voyage home to Scotland, nor your true claim to the throne of England.
Quite right, brother. That is the ruling of Holy Mother Church.
Madam, you are the English Queen.
Elizabeth is bastard and heretic.
You're right.
Who's this priest, uncle?
He's Father Ballard, your new chaplain and confessor.
An English priest?
But I'm no longer Englishman.
Or Frenchmen or Scotsman.
There are in all life and death matters only two sorts of man,
Catholic and heretic.
Only a fool thinks otherwise.
I shall not forget it.
And this is David Riccio, a singer from Italy.
I have traveled far to serve you, Your Grace.
And we are far to go.
Walk with me.
Only two sorts of men, which sort are the English priest and the little Italian?
The priest is a Jesuit serving only you, the true Queen of England.
You may trust him with your life.
The singer is the agent of the Pope.
Yours will be a Protestant court.
You need a safe and secret way to your real friends.
Ourselves in France, Philip in
Spain and His Holiness in Rome.
Riccio is the way. Let him seem to sing for his supper.
Promote him, slowly, and trust him.
He speaks many languages and he's expert with ciphers.
Andrew!
Move those lazy whores and peasants before I take the flat of my sword to them.
Lower your voice, my gracious lord, the sound of it is hard to bear.
Well, then you must stuff your delicate ears, madam.
You are going to hear many like it in Scotland, when you've left the twitterings of the French court behind.
If that is an example of Scottish wit, we're in for a bleak winter.
Lord Bothwell, we now sail direct to Scotland.
Oh, that will be a rougher voyage than the Channel, madam.
I'm not afraid of the sea, my lord.
We shall next meet at the Port of Leith, Your Grace, where I shall have your white horses fit for your triumphal ride into Edinburgh.
Shall I ride in triumph, Bothwell?
Will all be well?
Well, there's only one question,
Your Grace.
Will you rule the Scottish lords or will they rule you?
I shall rule the lords.
I wish you then, Queen
Mary Stuart, a fare journey.
Adieu, François.
Goodbye, dear France.
Goodbye.
I never thought to be sad at returning home.
It's so long since we all left there.
Sad. Dear Fleming, now it comes to it, I welcome Scotland.
There will be two ships.
The Queen in one and Bothwell, as escort, in the other.
Your sea captains can take Bothwell's ship, here.
Why? It'll provoke French anger and Scottish, to no purpose.
If I am to keep my promise, we must cage Bothwell.
He's dangerous.
With him to help her,
Mary might find a way to finish me and rule Scotland alone.
But he is no papist.
He's worse.
He's an atheist who mocks God and fears no man.
His pride is his loyalty to the
Stuart Queen and he cannot be bribed.
Cannot?
I hope we catch him alive, my lord.
I'd like to study such a rarity.
Where are we, in the name of God?
I don't know, Majesty.
The captain swears this is the charted landing place.
Listen...
Jamie!
Good health to Your Majesty.
Welcome to Scotland.
James, what has happened?
Where are my people?
For five days fog has lain over land and sea.
You were not expected so soon.
But you are here?
We rode hard when the warning gun fired.
Your loyal lords of the congregation welcome you.
Oh, I understand.
Then soon the royal guards will be here, the carpet for me to stand upon the canopy.
There will be gun salutes?
No, madam, there will be nothing.
We can waste no money on idle show.
Aye!
This is not France.
God bless Scotland.
And God bless the Scottish Queen, who is so near her throne at last.
My lords of the Congregation, you do me great honor to ride in such haste to meet me.
My good brother shows great wisdom that he wastes no money upon ceremony.
Aye.
Good brother, I embrace you for your wisdom.
And before these lords
I name you my Chief Minister.
God save the Queen!
God save the Queen!
I thank you, dear sister.
Bring the horses.
Bring the Queen's horses.
These are not mine. I will wait until mine have landed.
Your stable was taken by the English.
Taken? How can that be?
They are in the other ship.
Bothwell has them safe.
His ship was captured.
It had no safe conduct through English waters.
Elizabeth's ambassador has already complained to me.
And Bothwell, is he dead?
They have him safely.
It is only three days since the two ships parted company in the fog.
And yet you, brother, know everything of its fate, and the fate of Lord Bothwell.
Even the fastest horseman could not ride from London to Edinburgh in three days.
Will you mount, your Majesty? It is a sharp morning and we must move on.
Faster! Faster! Faster!
Well, Robin?
My wife's death is judged to be an accident.
I am declared innocent, Your Majesty, despite all efforts of Cecil's spies to find evidence against me.
Then you are indeed innocent.
So you may return to court.
If you permit it.
I order it.
And I order you to take the apartment above my own.
I feel I will have need of your advice, constantly.
If you would have me constantly at your side, then marry me, my love.
In this land there will be but one mistress and no master.
Then, madam,
I will come no more to court.
I will leave this land.
You shall not.
You are my Master of Horse.
When they jibe at me in Catholic Courts, they say the Horse Master, who mounts the Queen so freely, would now put a bridal on her.
You dare to talk to me of marriage?
Forgive me. It was my delight in seeing you again.
You are a commoner whose head itches for a crown.
Attend to your common business,
Horse Master.
Keep the Scottish Queen's horses well.
It may suit me to return them one day.
The Scottish Queen...
Here's a pretty widow for an ambitious lord.
Your grace?
I said, Robin, you shall dine with me tonight, and we will keep each other loving company until the morning light.
Well, there you are, sister.
Your palace at Holyrood.
Mary Stuart!
God struck down your mother and he will destroy you.
Who is this man?
John Knox, madam.
The leader of our church.
Of your church, not mine, brother.
Hear me.
I have prayed that this Queen would die before she set foot on this land.
See what she brings with her, a priest.
Better that she'd come with French troops.
She will comfort the papists we have driven from this land...
Monks, friars, priests...
Nuns and all such filthy persons.
One mass is more fearful than 10,000 armed soldiers.
Not to me, sir.
You defend the Mass?
I defend the Church of Rome, for that I think is the true Church of God.
Ride on.
No.
I will hear with patience your ugly words, John Knox.
For you, like all my subjects, shall have the free use of your conscience and I of mine.
Ride on.
Papist whore.
You have humiliated me.
You shall keep your religion, sister.
But I suggest you are a little more discreet about it.
Am I to rule here?
We must have no illusions, you and I.
We shared a father in James the Fifth of Scotland.
And I came out on the wrong side of the blanket.
It is the fate of the bastard sons of kings never to be kings themselves, this I accepted long ago.
I am not ambitious for your crown.
I will resist any man that tries to take it from you.
You are the Queen.
I am the Queen, but you are to rule.
I want you to be happy.
You shall have dancing, and hunting, music and good eating.
But leave the troubles of state to me.
Come, Mary.
A secret way to the royal apartments.
Follow me.
Your bedchamber.
I persuaded your uncle, the Cardinal, to permit me to bring from France all your personal belongings.
Thank you. I thank you with all my heart.
Here you will dine and take your ease.
And this is where we will hold council.
Your Presence Chamber.
Prepare yourself, and in an hour
I will bring all the lords of Scotland and present them to you.
You have made a good beginning.
Remember, be discreet.
And consult me in all things.
There will be a private chapel for the practice of your religion.
Stay out of the public eye, priest, and do not provoke the lords of the Congregation.
And, Mary, you may travel if you wish.
Scotland is a fine land.
I thank you, dear brother.
Dear sister.
Did you hear him, Davie?
Did you hear him?
Run away and play, he tells me, as if I were a child.
Davie, I'm trapped.
Not yet, Your Grace.
He has me in a cage.
Then you must appear to sing sweetly and happily, madam.
I cannot do that forever. The lies stick in my throat. I hate him.
He is learning to trust you.
When he trusts you, he will become careless and then you will have him in a cage.
Davie, I have no army, no treasury, no allies.
You have allies. Your uncles are first among them.
They will solve your problems by finding you a husband.
A great prince.
A Catholic.
With an army at his back.
To deal with the good James Stuart.
Then you will march south, to England.
First, let us secure Scotland.
Is it possible?
It is certain.
Then I will marry quickly.
I will not drag out my days in this barren land.
Did you smell those fine
Scottish lords? Mother of God.
And to think my sweet mother endured all this for my sake.
Marriage, then, shall be our policy.
The marriage of Mary Stuart to any catholic prince will be treated as an act of war against England.
Tell that, my lords' ambassador, to your royal masters.
We will have no foreign power upon our northern border.
We realize that our sweet young cousin in Scotland has been deluded by dangerous and self-seeking men.
So now we offer a wise and just solution.
We have a plan for the marriage of Mary.
We offer our most loyal and loving subject,
Robert Dudley, to Mary Stuart in marriage.
And we shall tomorrow create him Earl of Leicester, that he is more worthy.
Mary will not take it.
She will rage against the insult as they do.
No, madam, I must object again, most strongly against this proposed marriage between Mary and this gentleman.
My God, it is not my choice to go north to that barbarous country?
It is mine.
A commoner, a Protestant, and the subject of scandal and rumor? My choice.
However, I shall obey with a better heart knowing I am opposed by Master Cecil.
You are not suitable.
My duty is to foresee the result of
English policy and convince the Queen.
What you judge ill for me must benefit me, that is the lesson of our past dealings.
And you can feel a crown upon your head.
It is you I love.
Only you.
Then marry Mary.
For only when she is married to a loving subject of mine will I be safe, from the assassin, the fanatic and the rebellion in her cause.
And she will take him, because I will send with him the thing she most lusts after, the promise sealed and witnessed of the English throne at my death.
Go and prepare for your journey, and go quickly before my heart wins over my head.
Sweet Majesty.
Your Majesty, you will regret this day.
If you think Robert Dudley will put aside his ambition...
Do you really believe she will not take him?
I do.
Good. For I do not intend her to have him, though I mean the world to think I do. Oh, no, William.
She shall not have the brave and faithful Robin!
I have someone quite different in mind as a husband for Mary Stuart.
But first, with your help,
I must find a suitable ambassador to bait the trap.
Out. Do not bolt the door.
Good sir,
I'm told you cannot be bought.
Ah.
You're Cecil.
You give gold to Scottish traitors.
You are penniless because the Lord
James Stuart has sold your lands.
And you may remain here in the tower until your death.
You have no friends.
I have long had it in mind to kill you.
I have it in mind to release you.
The price?
That you speak honestly to your Queen, for mine.
Here is the Deed of Succession.
Nothing is hidden.
I freely offer her the crown.
After much thought I consider Mary to be the just and rightful claimant.
There is no signature,
Your Grace.
There will be.
When your sweet mistress takes the noble Earl of Leicester in marriage, she guarantees peace between our two realms.
Then I will sign this sacred promise and she will inherit all here, after my death, which, pray God, will not be too soon.
Amen!
And I am to take your offer in secret to my Queen.
That is all?
AII.
And as a gesture of my sincerity,
I am sending with you Lord Henry Darnley.
Not only will he see you safely back to Scotland, he will bear my personal greetings and gifts to your sovereign.
He will return to her Majesty her fine stable of horses.
Lord Darnley is also a cousin,
a member of one of England's oldest catholic families
He has a royal claim by blood to England's throne, second only to Mary's
Oh, he is the finest flower of our nobility, gentle, brave and chivalrous
Are you ready, my lord?
Ready, Your Grace.
God give you a good journey, my lord.
I charge you to tell our cousin, Mary, it is our deepest regret that these fine horses were taken in error.
Say to her Majesty, "Elizabeth most abjectly begs her forgiveness."
Trust me, Your Grace.
I do, good Henry, to fulfill all my hopes.
Farewell, my lords.
Darnley looked beautiful, did he not?
I wager you fifty gold crowns
Mary will take him.
Madam, it is too serious a matter for gambling.
Cecil, you may be an expert in matters of state, but you know very little of women.
Mary is a young widow.
Her blood is hot.
It's a strange thing,
I feel I know her.
We have never met and yet I know her.
Your reasoning is beyond me.
If I were in her position, would I take the cast-off lover of my enemy as a husband?
No, madam.
You'd be full of fury.
And would I, in my pride, ignore the document of the Act of Succession and look elsewhere for a husband to spite my enemy?
No, madam, you would not.
No, I would not.
But she will.
And supposing at this time there should come to my court a beautiful young man on a white horse, with some claim to the English throne and a Catholic to boot, would I not look upon him with favor?
But with Dudley comes the future crown of England!
No true monarch will turn her back on that, not even Mary of Scotland.
That monarch is first a woman.
You would never ignore such an offer for a pretty fellow.
This woman is first a monarch.
Here comes Robin.
Madam, you are wrong.
Now I am certain.
No woman would choose the boy before the man.
I will accept your wager.
Fifty golden crowns she chooses
Dudley and the succession.
If she chooses Dudley, then we are safe from foreign Catholic princes, though I admit it will be a hard price for me to pay.
If she takes Darnley, we have given nothing and she has a weak, degenerate fool as her consort.
Win or lose the wager,
I cannot lose the game.
Harry! Harry!
Oh, my love. My love.
Don't move.
Be still.
What a happy fall, to have such a comfort afterwards.
There are tears on your cheeks.
I saw again the death of my husband, that is all.
But...
Leave us!
Robin!
I am rejected.
She rejected me.
She kept me waiting five days without an audience.
She flaunted herself before me in the company of Darnley.
She dances with Darnley, she dines with Darnley.
She rides with Darnley.
And has rejected you?
With insults.
Encouraged by Bothwell, your honest messenger.
She spoke of me openly as your cast-off lover and far beneath any true Queen.
She must be demented.
Before my eyes she tore up the document of succession.
But she consorts with that boy!
That lewd, mincing, pouting boy.
And by all the saints, madam, she is a woman that needs a man.
What kind of a woman, Robin?
Formed like a goddess.
More than I?
Is she better formed than I?
No. No, madam.
Well, does she dance more elegantly?
No. But with a certain fire.
Oh, she is fiery! I had heard that she was very dull and sits by the hour sewing.
Does she play instruments more skillfully than I?
No. But to do her justice, she loves music.
Can she converse freely in
Italian, Latin, Greek as I can?
Who knows.
But she speaks most charmingly.
She charmed you.
This woman who has offered me the most deadly insult, charms you, my lord.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I found her tiresome.
Liar!
Madam!
Liar! Liar! Liar!
Madam! Madam! Madam!
You were as eager as a young lover to ride to her.
To wed and bed her.
I went only at your command.
I love only you. Oh!
Well, you have played your part. I cannot complain.
My part?
Oh, it is her loss if she rejects you.
Oh, how glad I am to have you home.
Now tell me truly,
I am no longer angry.
Is she really as beautiful as they say?
Well, she is quite beautiful.
Get out! Out! Out!
I have it in me to send you to cool your passion for her...
Get out! Out!
May it please Almighty God she hates me as I hate her, for then she must marry Darnley, and I have won.
You seem very rich, Davie.
I am valued.
No. You are hated.
But not by you, sweet Harry.
The commoner.
The detested, little foreigner.
You are jealous of my influence.
You must speak for me, Davie.
I will be king here.
I have the right to be a king.
All the Catholic nobles of England will support Mary's cause if I am king.
But you are vicious, Harry.
You have a taste for all the vices.
I thought you loved me.
I love the Queen better, and I think it a cruel act to help put you between her sheets.
You want to keep me between yours?
Oh, Edinburgh is full of pretty boys, and like you,
I have a taste for a woman as well.
I shall not lack comfort.
We are outcasts in this court.
No man is your friend save me, and no man is mine save you.
Like it or not, sweet Harry...
We must hold to each other.
The Queen!
Working. Always working.
I could not sleep.
Nor I.
Davie, you must advise me.
If I can, Your Grace.
Is it not true that all our hopes for my freedom through marriage are dashed because we are told if I marry a foreign prince there will be war with England?
It is true.
But...
What if I married an Englishman?
Englishman?
Harry Darnley.
Answer me. Is he a good match?
Will the holy father give his blessing to us?
I cannot deny it.
I believe it is God's will that both wise policy and my deepest longings are fulfilled in him.
I love him.
It is the good fortune of Queens to choose where other women must wait to be chosen.
I choose him, Davie. He will be my husband, my lover, my companion.
And your master if you make him King.
Oh, no, I am the Queen.
He will be my consort.
He will understand that if he loves me.
Who could fail to love Your Majesty?
But will the Scottish lords hate him, Davie?
No more than any other foreigner set over them.
What would James say?
Oh, what a fine king Darnley will make. I must have him.
Pray for me, Davie.
Does she often visit you at night, Davie?
Oh, we work here in secret.
Is it only for state matters that she comes?
You have the mind of a brothel keeper.
Did you not listen at the door to find out?
I listened, but the door was too thick.
Harry...
If I speak for you with the Queen, will you at all times give her first place, acknowledging her the true monarch of this realm?
No. I will be the master.
Then I will oppose you.
"I choose him, Davie."
When will she find the courage to ask me? Will it be tomorrow?
Do not betray her.
I warn you.
"What a fine king he will make..."
Listen to me.
No, listen to her.
"I must have him, Davie."
Oh, she shall have me, and I shall be the master.
Kiss the hand of your King, Davie, and
I will forgive you for your little warnings.
Kiss it, Davie.
Come.
Kneel to me.
Kneel.
Say "I will love and serve you, King Henry."
Say it, Davie.
It is in God's hands, Henry...
But you are reckless to scorn your only friend.
Now the sly little Italian will try poison against me.
He will whisper in her ear.
He will plant doubts.
He fears to lose his place.
It's not in God's hands, Davie.
It's in mine.
Admit the Lord James Stuart.
Madam, what is so important that I am summoned from Council and then kept waiting at your door?
Dear brother,
I wish you to make preparations for my marriage to Henry, Lord Darnley.
I forbid that.
He is a Catholic.
And neither I nor John Knox...
John Knox, that hypocrite who has just married a girl of 15.
That aged lecher who hides behind the words of God.
Madam, you forget yourself.
No. I do not. You shall not prevent my happiness.
I will marry Henry,
Lord Darnley.
I will speak to you again when you have more control of yourself.
Guards!
It was a bad day for you, James, when you sold off my lands.
From this moment I alone rule in
Scotland. Now who is caged, brother?
David Riccio, I choose you as my Chief Minister.
James Stuart, Earl of Moray,
I banish you from my kingdom.
Give up your keys and seals of office to Master Riccio.
Riccio, you are a Catholic.
Be sure that you are confessed and in a state of grace each hour.
For from this moment, I promise you, death is at your shoulder.
Truly I am of the old religion and we shall have such a re-birth of it in this land as will rejoice the hosts of heaven!
Your Majesty, if you value your safety, either imprison or execute him.
I will not take that advice.
But I shall give it to you.
When he has gone, the other lords will bow the knee to you, but in time, when he returns, they will join him again for bloody revenge on all here.
I will not begin my reign like a tyrant.
Escort my brother to the border and return as soon as possible.
We must prepare for my marriage to Lord Darnley.
And with my body,
I thee worship.
And with all my worldly chattels,
I thee endow.
And with all my worldly chattels,
I thee endow.
In the name of the Father...
In the name of the Father...
...and of the Son...
...and of the Son...
...and of the Holy Ghost.
...and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Amen.
I am so happy,
I dare not speak of it.
What is that?
A gift, Your Grace. From my
Lord Bothwell to the Queen.
The jewel from the hilt of his sword,
Your Grace. It is all he has of value.
Return it.
The Lord Bothwell bade me tell you that when you have need of the sword from which this jewel is taken, then send me Andrew to summon him.
Yes, I will, good Andrew.
Harry, look!
If you keep it, you do not love me.
I love you dearly.
Then do what I ask.
I demand it as your husband.
I may not, for then you would rule here, Henry. That cannot be.
You shall rule above all others, save the Queen.
I am the King.
I will be obeyed.
I am the King!
On the night of his marriage a King shall be served by his lords.
Morton, Ruthven, Huntly, you shall serve me.
Come. We will show this Queen who is the master.
Your Grace!
I am the Chief Minister,
I will serve you.
I will kneel to serve you if you wish it.
Let these good lords continue their pleasure on this happy day.
No.
No. They shall serve us both, Davie, I order it.
I, your King, order it.
No, Your Majesty...
I ordered you to sit with me, Davie.
This is your reward for speaking to the Queen for your loving friend.
Come, my lords.
All servants, get out!
Get out!
We have better servants here.
Sit by the Queen,
Master Riccio.
It is your right, for you are the Chief Minister.
My lords...
You see how I am obeyed,
Madam?
I see how you will behave if you were ever granted the crown matrimonial and become a King in your own right, my lord.
They obey me.
When the Queen is served, serve the
Chief Minister, serve him before me.
Serve the little Italian, who is the Pope's friend.
Now their hatred for you will be so great,
Davie, they'll have none left for me.
My lords, soon I will be abed with this lady...
My Queen.
Therefore I drink a toast to my firstborn.
Your Majesty...
Be seated.
I sent for you to thank you for your gift.
Why are you leaving Edinburgh?
Now that you have chosen a King it is time
I left the court to care for my own affairs.
But I need you here,
Bothwell.
But, my lady, you now have a husband to protect you.
He will lead your army, put down such of your lords as intrigue against you and make wise policy,
I have no doubt.
Do you oppose my marriage?
I never oppose the rightful monarch.
I've grown poor in the habit.
I will not be mocked.
"Mocked"?
I could not find words to mock a Queen of Scotland who chooses a smooth-faced boy as her master and a base-born Italian as her Chief Minister!
Go then! Leave the court!
Stay from it!
Bothwell.
You've grown poor in my service, you say?
I have.
You shall be paid off, my lord.
I can manage well enough without.
Spare me your arrogance.
I will give you money!
Keep it to buy suits for your husband.
Why are you angry?
Do you fear you are displaced?
Are you jealous?
You could say, Your Majesty, with truth
I am jealous.
Then you are foolish.
I need your help, Bothwell, to keep order in this country.
And in due time we will march south.
We will destroy that heretic Elizabeth, and I will rule my two Kingdoms, as I was ordained to do, if God is willing.
Will you stay at court and help me?
I will return when I have settled my affairs on the border.
When?
When I have married for money,
Your Grace.
Married?
Not without my permission, my good lord.
I promise you...
Now I know who is King here.
This upstart!
And you come creeping to him at night.
That's not my child you're carrying, it's his bastard!
The child is yours, God help me, the child is yours.
You have both betrayed me.
That's why he speaks against me.
You're not fit to rule.
That's why I oppose you.
I am your enemy, not the Queen!
Now go.
You disgust me!
I disgust you?
You loved me.
You loved me.
Now I disgust you.
I'm lost.
I'm lost.
Hawk Master!
Your Majesty!
What is it?
The King,
Your Majesty.
Mary!
Keep the others at a distance, Seton.
The Queen bids you rest.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
You must return at once.
At once.
Why are you shouting?
Are you drunk as ever?
No. No. Forgive me, Mary, but there is a plot and you must return.
Plot? Are you ill?
I'd like to believe that, for then I could forgive you the bitter shame and pain you've caused me these past few months.
Your own guards turned me back from the Royal apartments.
When I drew my dagger on them they threatened to kill me... To kill their King.
You are not the King. You are the King consort. That is all.
You're merely Henry, Lord Darnley who married a queen.
If that queen dies, you will be Henry, Lord Darnley again and have no rights to the crown.
It was you!
You ordered them to keep me back!
Yes. Your habits disgust me.
You have shamed me. The whole court will ridicule me, Madam.
Then leave the court!
I'm forbidden your bed?
You shall never come near me again.
Ride home, my lord.
You have new apartments.
That little bastard Riccio is behind this. I will be revenged!
I will be revenged!
Don't kill me.
Don't kill me!
Stand up, Your Majesty.
We are your loyal subjects.
We believe you are much wronged, Your Grace.
By God, I am.
The papal spy, Riccio, has bewitched the Queen.
There is talk of their meeting in his room at night.
State business, they say.
They say you are cuckolded, my lord.
Lies!
It is an unnatural thing for a woman to rule.
And it is most unnatural that the great lords of Scotland shall sit in council to be lorded over by the little papist when there is a King in the land.
You mock me. Look, I am not the King.
I am the King consort, a puppet King, shut out from all power.
You know this.
We, your loyal subjects, will make you the true King.
We, the Council, will grant you the crown matrimonial to rule here, to be the first in the land.
If this is done, Your Grace, you will rule even if the Queen is dead.
King Henry the First of Scotland and the Isles!
Long live the King!
Long live the King!
And what must I do to gain the prize, my lords?
Embrace the Protestant faith and defend it against all papists in this land.
The Queen is a papist.
All papists.
I agree.
We have drawn up this covenant.
On our part we pledge you the crown and that we will pursue and slay and root out all who oppose this resolution.
You will cut Davie's throat?
There is no word of killing in the bond.
And if need be you will kill one other?
We have all signed the bond.
And no man among you dare betray the other.
It is a good Scottish custom.
It lacks one signature.
On your part, you will hold us innocent and defend us, even in the presence of the Queen herself, no matter what action we have to take.
Is that all?
You will pardon and recall
James Stuart, Earl of Moray.
Agreed.
Then sign, Your Majesty, and hasten the great day of your coronation.
On one further condition.
Name it.
That you will kill Riccio in her presence when I am there to see the deed.
She must come to no harm before that moment.
Is this true?
That is a copy from our ambassador.
Everyone in the Scottish court knows of it, save the Queen and her Italian.
Everyone.
And her loving husband has put his signature and seal to it.
He has.
So much for marriage.
The Lord James Stuart is ready to travel to Scotland.
So?
He must have money to hold the lords in his payroll.
Then let him find it elsewhere.
But, Madam, everything that you hoped for has happened.
Now we must support our Protestant friends.
That is a murder bond drawn up by treacherous subjects against their queen.
Where is my name on it?
Where does it say that Elizabeth of
England shall pay the wages of assassins?
Your Grace, it was you who sent Darnley to Scotland.
But the rest was in God's hands.
I leave this to him also. Come, Robin.
The lady is with child, a child that could one day be King of England.
How long must I live under the shadow of this other queen?
I desire her to be without power but not dead.
By God, if it were not for policy,
I have it in me to ride north into her very palace and warn her of what is to come.
Madam, these Scottish lords are set upon a certain course.
It is wise for us as it is for them that they pursue it to the end.
Then let them find the means elsewhere!
Majesty...
Majesty, if you would but marry me and bear a child yourself, then her shadow would be lifted from you.
Master Cecil, pay James
Stuart 3,000 crowns in gold and send him home on a fast horse.
Let the gold coin be of any kind save that which has my head on it.
I will have no knowledge of her death.
See to it!
Almighty God, I thank thee for the endless ambition of Robert Dudley to be king, and for the many times it has provoked the queen to wise policy, against her will, but to Thy glory.
Amen.
Where are they?
In the turret.
Elizabeth is so demanding of the gentleman's affection he'd never be reconciled with his own wedded wife for fear the royal anger.
Why are you here?
If it please Your Majesty, let Davie Riccio come out of this privy chamber where he has hidden too long.
It is by my command that he is here.
He has offended your honor!
Your mind is full of fantasies.
You have a fever.
Escort Lord Ruthven away and lock the doors.
Lay not hands on me!
Oh, God! Save the Queen!
Oh, God, Harry.
Save me! Save me!
In the name of God,
I'll save you.
Save me!
Oh, my God!
No!
Riccio! Kill him!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop them!
And this is from the King.
Losers!
Oh, no, Your Grace, speak gently to His Majesty.
I will never rest until you have a heavier heart than I have now.
Be silent!
That in my belly will be revenged on you all!
If you live!
Silence, my lords!
Do not threaten the heir to Scotland.
He shall be born, but we shall keep this queen imprisoned from that time.
"Imprisoned from that time"?
This good King shall have the whole government of the realm.
The heir, we will bring up to the Protestant faith, and you shall be our perpetual prisoner.
The child!
I believe it is the child.
Harry!
Help the Queen to her bed.
Take her gently.
Hurry here.
With all care.
My lords, give us privacy!
If the queen is in labor after these dreadful events then there must be calm.
Come, my lords.
I will stay.
The palace is guarded.
You have chosen your way, Sire, you must follow it to the end.
I have chosen.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
The King is there alone, but the outer door is guarded.
We must escape tonight or we are lost.
And we must take my husband with us or the lords will use him to seize the Crown.
Madam, how?
I must make that traitor, my husband, into a double traitor.
Find Andrew. If possible, he could bring us horses.
Be brave.
God will watch over you.
Harry!
What's become of your pain?
Why are you here?
Forgive me, Harry, our child is still alive, it is not yet time.
I have never betrayed you, but I have wronged you and I beg your forgiveness.
It's too late.
No, I swear it is not.
You shall be the King without being elected by those murderers, but I'm in terror for you,
Henry.
Those murderers will butcher you once they have our child safe in their keeping.
What can I do?
What can I do?
Harry, don't be afraid, I know what to do,
I know what to do, trust me.
Trust me.
Hurry!
For God's sake, hurry!
Harry, will you wait? I cannot go so fast for fear I miscarry.
Miscarry if you will, we can make another when we're safe.
Father, Davie...
I know.
The Lord Bothwell is waiting.
Can you ride a horse, Your Grace?
There's no coach or litter.
Yes, I can ride.
Have we enough horses?
Aye, Madam, you shall ride with me.
It will be safer, so tuck up your skirts...
And hurry.
But if we are caught, they will cut us into collops and feed the dogs by us.
Andrew!
Welcome to Hermitage.
My sanctuary, Madam.
Thank you, my lord.
Are you all right?
Indeed, I am and in good spirits.
Come, let us go in.
Who is this lady?
She was the Lady Jean Gordon, Your Grace, daughter of the richest of Highland lords.
Was?
She is now Lady Bothwell.
Welcome to Hermitage Castle,
Your Majesty.
You were married.
Yes, Madam.
Help me, the child is coming!
I gave you no permission to marry, my lord.
Take her in quickly.
Well?
Scotland has a new prince.
Oh, no!
The Queen of Scots is lighter of a fair son.
I am but barren stock.
I kept it from her as long as I dared, but the defeat of the Protestant lords of Scotland forced me to speak.
They're defeated?
Yes.
Bothwell raised an army and put them to flight.
Ruthven, Morton, and Huntly have come over the border to the sanctuary.
Stuart is under siege at Dunbar.
Stuart!
All right?
Rouse yourself, James, don't you hear the pipes?
It's your loving sister come to put a rope around your neck.
Your Majesty, the rebels are defeated.
Dunbar is yours.
The Queen has triumphed!
Where is my brother?
Is he dead?
No. I've saved him for the scaffold.
Then let him make his will and say his prayers, for I shall hang him before tonight.
You cannot hang me without killing your husband.
I took no part in Riccio's death...
Liar.
...but your husband was there.
He signed the murder bond with the Scottish lords.
It is a forgery.
It is a copy.
The original is safely hidden in England.
No court will condemn me without him.
And even you, great Queen, cannot act without due process of law.
Then, by God,
I will act with it.
It will give me great pleasure to see you both on the same scaffold!
Bothwell, let us do it now.
Will you split the kingdom?
Hang the Stuart line?
If you accuse brave Harry, he will shout from the rooftops that your child is Riccio's bastard, and that you were Riccio's whore.
And that the killing was the just execution of a commoner who had committed high treason by cuckolding the king.
No!
We do not need the law!
Your brother will have died of his wounds in battle.
No.
For myself I care nothing, for the shame I care nothing, but I dare not give the heretics of Scotland and England a case to use against my son.
And I will not risk his inheritance even for the pleasure of your death.
Scotsmen, here is your future king,
James VI of Scotland.
And in good time,
James I of England.
I am the Queen by right of birth and right of arms.
And tyranny, I detest.
I practice the old religion but I tolerate the new.
I rule in God's name, so I rule in justice.
The better part of justice is mercy, therefore, on this great day of triumph,
I shall be merciful.
I pardon James Stuart,
Earl of Moray.
Before you all he shall be reconciled with my husband and Lord Bothwell.
But I...
He hates me.
Not as much as he hates me,
Your Grace.
Put a good face on it, for policy's sake.
We are deceiving the people.
Take my hand, sire.
A man who first betrayed the Queen and then betrayed his fellow conspirators is like a leper...
Must be glad of a friend.
So, I will and wait impatiently for the day when one of you slit the throat of the other.
Or yours.
Leave me go!
I have had enough!
Everywhere I go I'm shunned!
People look through me like I'm a ghost!
I will not be made to feel guilty over a scrap of paper.
To your bed!
No, Madam.
I will go to your bed...
Either that or I'll leave the country.
I shall go to Italy, to the Pope.
He will annul our marriage.
I shall tell him that you were so eager that you forgot the dispensation which cousins must have to marry.
Villain!
Annulment will make your son a bastard!
I know. I know. And she will do anything to save her son's inheritance as the future King...
So come to bed, sweet wife.
Bothwell!
Leave us!
And quickly,
I have a great appetite.
Oh, for God's sakes, smile, madam.
And bring me some wine.
Even though I disgust you, you will love and fondle me and have me by your side again as King.
As I mount you, so shall I mount the throne.
Have you killed him?
No...
I came to do you that service.
He's drugged.
He's diseased.
Diseased?
Since before the birth of the Prince he's been vagabonding at night.
He is poxed.
He will rot with it.
Merciful God!
An honorable end is better than this.
Bring back the lords in exile.
They will bring him to account.
Once more.
"I have departed the court with my Lord Bothwell
"You will await my return
"Husband, there are certain lords in
England who have been punished enough,
"lords who murdered Riccio
"They are therefore pardoned by the mercy of their Queen
"Soon you shall meet them again"
I am betrayed.
I brought him home to lie in Scottish soil.
On his deathbed, we swore vengeance.
So let us decide which of us will kill the King in combat.
He's sick of the pox.
He cowers in his bed.
He'll not fight.
Then we'll drag him out and kill him as we did Riccio.
Nobody cared about the death of a little foreigner.
Everyone will care about the murder of a king.
His Majesty has a house outside the wall of Edinburgh where he took his whores and his young men.
Kirk o' Field.
He plans to murder Mary Stuart in that house.
He has filled the cellars with gunpowder.
He means to go there with the Queen and make his excuses to leave her for a few hours.
And then...
Blow her up!
With a choice of knife, gun, poison, or rope, why would anyone choose gunpowder?
Nobody chooses gunpowder, Stuart, in these hard times.
Nevertheless, the cellars at Kirk o' Field are full of gunpowder.
His Majesty is a notorious drunkard and fool. Also, he is sick...
I think that he will bungle his attempt on the Queen and blow himself up.
Can you help us?
Bury your dead.
Leave the rest to me.
Next he will lord it over us.
For a while...
A very little while.
And so we safely arrived at Kirk o' Field
I have obeyed you, my love,
because I believe that he is condemned to death by the pox,
which is the wrath of God upon his vile nature
So what is planned is no sin
But God forgive me if I do wrong
And after your divorce we shall be man and wife
And you shall be no puppet king but the master
For the first time I am loved and fulfilled
I have turned my back on God for you
So be true to me, my love, be true
Andrew?
My lord.
Get ready.
We leave for Edinburgh.
There is work for you to do.
Aye, my lord.
It is time to leave,
Your Grace.
You promised to stay.
It is Fleming's marriage feast, so I must go. I will return.
Why'd you keep Davie's guitar.
Why'd you play it?
Is it to anger me once more?
No, Harry. But I never forget those who are loyal to me.
Davie is dead.
Let him go.
Yes, it is just a year.
Pity me, kinsmen.
For the sake of Jesus Christ.
Pity me!
He was to have an honorable death, to be challenged to a duel.
You told me so.
I would...
Death is death however it comes.
Now we must look to our future.
The Ambassadors of France and Spain, Your Majesty.
And of Scotland.
We are mourning the late King Henry of Scotland.
We mourn because the Scottish Court does not.
He was once our subject.
We are shocked at his abominable murder.
We are astounded at what followed.
The King was taken at dead of night and buried without ceremony.
His clothes, his goods, his horse and his armor were given to Lord Bothwell.
Voices cry out that Bothwell is the murderer.
The Scots have risen in rebellion.
Catholic and Protestant, lord and peasant, combine to destroy the tyrant Bothwell.
And yet Queen Mary Stuart has married him.
It was once said in Catholic courts that Elizabeth would marry her horse master who had murdered his wife.
Then her people would turn her out in favor of Mary.
I have not married.
Leicester is innocent.
My people did not rebel and Mary Stuart does not rule here.
Tell your masters, do not interfere in Scotland nor will I.
Let the Scottish Queen settle her own affairs as I once settled mine.
How she longs to hear of Mary's death.
And how she dreads it.
No, no, no.
What is it?
A dream.
A dream.
Be thankful it is not James Stuart knocking on the door.
I am full of fears waking and sleeping.
All my forces will be here by day.
I sent the messengers three days ago.
Do not be afraid.
It's all right. It's my
Borderers. It is dawn.
They're all round us.
We can hold them till my men come.
Bothwell. Bothwell!
Show yourself, or are you afraid?
I will speak with him.
I am here, Stuart.
Tell Her Majesty to come down to us.
We have no quarrel with her.
It is you we have come for.
I will not go down.
Bothwell, have you the courage for single combat?
Or will you go on hiding in the skirts of the Queen?
I am not a sick man like the King you murdered.
I will cut him to pieces.
No, I will not let you go.
I will not be shamed, Mary.
Our forces will be here within an hour and then I will see you hanged from these walls.
You waste your breath. Roy!
There are your messengers.
Come now and fight.
That I will.
Andrew!
Andrew, bring my armor.
And when he comes down, we will cut his throat.
Jamie, you must not go down.
They will kill you as they killed Davie.
I will fight.
I will finish it this time.
When I go down you must leave by the secret way out of here.
No.
It leads beyond the castle ground.
Andrew will guide you.
No. Let us go together. I beg you. You will not be seen.
I will not be dishonored.
My dear love, who remembers the honor of the dead?
You are no match for the treachery of these times.
Seton! Seton!
Mary. I beg you, do not disgrace me.
Listen to me. Your death will be mine. You must escape.
Rouse the Borderers yourself. I am still the Queen. While I live I reign.
Do not do this.
Goodbye, my dear love.
Go now.
Give me courage. Come with me and look down on those traitors.
Soon we must open the gates and give ourselves up to them.
God help us.
I shall watch the combat from here, brother.
You shall not wait long.
My husband is determined.
I cannot dissuade him.
The Deed of your Abdication.
It is the will of the lords and of the people that you sign it.
I will never abdicate. I am the Queen. I will die the Queen.
Huntly.
In this casket are your letters to Lord Bothwell which prove that you are a murderess and that you led the King to his death.
Abdicate or I will publish them and have you tried for murder.
No.
The Lord Bothwell will not be coming to your aid, lady.
He did not escape.
I have him.
It's not true.
Tomorrow I shall hang him.
No. No. No.
No. No. No.
Will you sign the Deed of Abdication?
Never!
Jamie! Jamie!
Mary, my love.
Jamie.
Jamie.
I thought you were dead.
They told me you were dead.
No.
Your brother saw an advantage in keeping me in this world for a further time.
They will pardon me, spare you, give me a passage to Denmark.
If I can persuade you to abdicate.
Oh, Jamie.
Now listen to me, Mary.
I'm an ambitious man hungry for life, but I do not fear death.
The only thing I fear is what can happen to you.
The Scottish lords demand your trial and execution.
Your brother wants you out of the way alive before it is too late.
He lies. He wants me dead, too.
No. Above all, he's a Stuart.
He'll save you if he can.
If you abdicate, he'll see you safe to the English border.
Our deaths or separate exile.
Jamie, there's no choice.
I can't exist without you.
I cry for death.
No.
You are Mary Stuart, the Queen.
Remember what you said to me.
"While you live, there is hope."
Cling to that. We shall not be separated.
One day I shall return for you with an army.
Until then, my love,
I hold you close to my heart.
Well?
Death or exile?
The English border is two miles from here.
I bid you farewell.
We shall not meet again.
So you must hope.
Long life, sister. We will bring up your son a good Protestant.
My son, my son,
God help him.
Seton, in this little time until we reach the English border we are quite free.
Free. How it eases the heart.
And I have good hopes.
I shall overcome all and be united with my Bothwell.
I am but five and twenty years of age.
I have my whole life before me.
Free! Free!
God help us if Cecil finds out about this.
Do not fear, madam, no one will find out.
The Catholics of the North have flocked to pay her homage since she came over the border.
At Carlisle she held Court even.
Is she mad to behave so blatantly?
I feel I may have misjudged her all these years.
She has never learnt discretion.
Well, is it discretion for me to meet her in secret?
It is imperative.
It's said you have a wolf by the ears, madam.
Well, let us look at the animal.
Stay here!
Sweet cousin.
Dear sister and cousin.
I am here to meet you as you so urgently demanded.
My business can only be discussed between us face to face.
I know you to be the enemy of all rebels against their rightful prince.
Indeed, madam, you are right.
The crime of my lords against their anointed queen is so great it buries all past differences between us.
I am confident of your help.
I ask it as a right.
I see that you have courage.
And I see that you are the great Queen of whom all speak.
And you are young.
Not too young to ride at the head of an army.
You have come to ask me for an army?
Yes, an army, supplies, money.
And money?
Which I shall most happily repay to you when I reign once again in Scotland.
How else may I aid you?
Be open with me, dear cousin.
For be assured there is no waking hour in my day when you are far from my thoughts.
Your fate is linked with mine.
We are princes both.
We are joined by blood.
What else have you to tell me or to ask of me?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Why? What else could there be?
Some helpful word concerning the murder of Lord Darnley.
Yes, of course.
Rest assured, Elizabeth, that
I am innocent in the matter.
That gives me great joy.
For when you are honorably acquitted of the crime of which you are accused then you shall have your army and your money.
Cousin, put it out of your mind that I came to England merely to save my life.
I came to recover my honor.
If you dare to doubt my word that I am innocent, then I will go at once to France.
You shall not.
Madam, in the past you have sheltered those very traitors who now rule in Scotland.
They entered freely into England, just as freely they returned.
Do you offer me less than my treacherous subjects?
Am I your prisoner?
If so, by what law?
If you forbid me to go to France, what will you do with me?
I shall take you deeper into
England for your protection.
Then I am your prisoner.
If you are innocent, what have you to fear?
You have deceived me. You are in league with my brother.
I will answer no accusations.
Who is there who may try me?
Who is my equal?
Will you do it? In public before the eyes of the world? No.
You lack the courage.
You hope to dishonor me.
It is you who are dishonored.
Did you believe I would send you back to Scotland at the head of a great army?
Did you believe I would sacrifice my reputation on your behalf?
It is not enough, madam, to speak one's mind in season and out as you do.
That is not the conduct of a Queen.
It is the outpouring of a pampered woman demanding that all indulge her.
It does not surprise me that you are here helpless and that your brother rules.
You are not fit for the high office to which you were born.
And you, madam, who hate me and wish me dead and fear to kill me, you are my mortal enemy.
I have noted since the day you denied me a passport through England all the blows you have struck against me.
I glory in your hatred.
For it is clear to me that Elizabeth, the bastard, the heretic, the usurper, is cursed by God, and will soon be too old to bear a child and will die a solitary old woman.
Above all it is clear that Elizabeth fears Mary.
And whatever my fate, my son will rule here in time.
You have noted all the blows
I struck against you.
AII.
All save one.
It was I who sent Henry, Lord Darnley to your court, sweet cousin.
Darnley?
Any Queen who could be guiled by such a pretty, wicked fellow and take him to her bed, and put a crown upon his head, does not inspire fear.
She inspires pity.
You have my pity, madam, as you had it on the day I sent Darnley north, knowing you to be without wisdom, discretion or any of the attributes of a Queen.
I see you have learned nothing since.
It is not surprising that you are spoken of in the courts of Europe as an infamous royal whore.
Madam.
My lord, I urge you to guard your mistress well for there are many who would wish her dead.
Now I have no choice.
I must keep her prisoner until the day of her death.
May it be soon.
Madam, there is an English officer from the French court to see you.
Yes.
Sir.
I bring you greetings, madam, and some letters which, I must tell you,
I have already shown to the authorities here, for I am a loyal Englishman.
Very well.
Leave them.
No, ma'am. I'm ordered to wait for your reply.
No need to waste time on these,
Your Grace.
Father Ballard!
Up, Your Grace. There is work to do, work of great danger.
Mistress Seton, do put an ear to the door and give us good warning.
Aye, Father.
This is from King Philip himself.
He has a new plan against Elizabeth.
Another?
We've been shut up for years and no help from him.
This one is different.
Read the letter, madam.
Very well.
What news have you from Scotland?
How is my dear son, James?
I have written to him ever since
I judged him able to read, but not one reply in all these years.
He is well enough to write regularly and cordially to Elizabeth.
Well, he is his father's son, after all.
The letter, Your Grace.
Read it quickly.
Just one more question.
Have you any news of my husband,
Lord Bothwell?
Lord Bothwell has died, insane, in a Danish prison.
Oh, Father.
Now I do repent of all my actions that have brought him to this terrible end.
Then will I hear your confession, my sovereign lady?
Yes, Father Ballard, it is time.
We need safeguards.
The risk is great.
It follows the pattern of similar plots, similar to the one in Northumberland.
It would be sensible, madam, to order her immediate execution.
No. I will not have Mary killed.
Why am I driven to bloodshed?
In all the years of my reign the scaffold has rotted from disuse.
Until Mary came into England.
Leave us!
Madam, I beg you, open your eyes.
Since the Pope has excommunicated you for keeping Mary prisoner, your Catholic subjects have been torn in two.
Whom should they serve,
Pope or Queen?
They risk the block in this world if they rebel and Hell in the next if they do not.
Keep this fact always before you.
It is now no sin to kill you.
To the Catholics it is the act of a Saint.
I am ill.
I will hear no more.
Destroy Mary, and all problems wither away.
No.
I fear her execution. It threatens me.
She is an anointed Queen as I am.
If I bring you proof that she plots to kill you?
No. Written proof. Irrefutable proof.
Is there such proof?
There will be.
William!
No forgeries. The evidence must stand up before the people and the parliament.
It has always been, from the beginning, her death or mine.
No, Walsingham, that priest will die before he speaks.
We have the rest, Babbington, Tichbourne,
Charnock, Gerrard. We have them all.
It was a great conspiracy.
But the absolute proof that Mary is personally involved we do not have.
You are wrong.
This good fellow is from Spain.
We caught him with Ballard, but he carried a letter in Mary's own hand.
She endorses the murder of Elizabeth as the main spring of the plot.
Now we have her.
"To His Holiness, the Pope."
"From King Philip of Spain."
"From an English gentleman."
And another.
And yet another.
Madam, you cast an evil spell on all you meet. Save me.
And now, my lord?
It has taken me years to trap you, madam.
Now you will come to justice.
No matter the evidence,
I fear a terrible retribution if I sign her death warrant.
Your Grace, until you decide, she must be shut away where no more traitors can reach her.
Where will you send her?
Fotheringhay Castle.
Jeez you, that evil place.
My heart goes out to her.
I have brought you proof positive.
If she begs forgiveness of me, she shall live.
Fotheringhay.
Am I to be murdered here?
As you see, despite your efforts, I am not dead.
Forgive me, I must sit.
The bitter winters of my imprisonment and the damp that runs down
English walls has entered my bones.
My council, my parliament and my people demand that I bring you to trial.
Like your father to your mother, will you permit me the sword and spare me the dull axe?
Madam, do not play with me.
From the moment of your imprisonment
I have lived in constant fear of assassination.
Your assassins, madam, your followers.
I have forced myself to walk in the open freely among my people, and I have never known at which moment the pistol or the dagger will do its work.
So make no jokes with me about death.
I'm very tired. Tell me what you want and then go.
I want to spare you, but you must beg my forgiveness.
You must write it now while I am here. Then I will forbid the trial.
Yes.
I knew of the plans for your death. I was glad of them, but now in this room, as
I look at you, face to face it is another matter.
I am glad you have been spared.
I will be happy to ask your forgiveness here between these four walls.
That is not enough. Write it.
No. It would damn me forever in the eyes of posterity.
I will keep the letter quite secret from all save my Chief Minister.
I am offering you your life.
I long for the trial. I long to stand before the world after these years of darkness and defend myself.
I thank God in his mercy and wisdom he has brought me to it.
I shall die a martyr to the Catholic faith, which is the true and eternal faith.
Nothing can prevent it.
No man is my judge. Not even you, madam, may judge me now, only God.
How little you have changed.
How wildly you rush to your destruction.
Your letters to Bothwell, madam.
Will you appear a noble Catholic martyr when these are read to the Court?
What will the world think when, after the details of the plots to murder me are revealed, we turn to the past?
Your life is steeped in blood and violence.
The actions which led to your disgusting marriage to the murderer Bothwell will be fully recounted before the Court and before the world.
Your absurd love letters will be read out for the people to gloat upon.
Will all this evidence of treachery, cruelty and lust rise like a hymn of praise to God, or will it cast you down forever?
Oh, God!
Write one short page to me and I will spare you the trial and you will live.
For the first time in your life put aside your personal desires and behave like a Queen.
Think of your son who will one day rule these two kingdoms, and do as I say.
No. You cannot tempt me. You are the devil. I will not succumb to you.
Jeez you.
In all my early years
I was misled and betrayed.
I sinned most grievously.
I lost my faith.
I will deny nothing to you here in this room, madam, for I have repented of it all.
I have made my peace with God.
I begged him that I might atone for all that has gone before.
And he has brought me here to die in glory.
I was greatly punished.
My kingdom, my possessions, my child, my husband were all taken from me.
I have been shut away for many years in abject misery and now I must die.
It is my destiny.
And it is your destiny, Elizabeth, to kill me.
I leave to you the pomp, the power, the intrigue and all that a prince in this world must endure or may enjoy.
Nothing you can say or do will avoid my martyrdom.
So now it is I who pity you.
For you cannot avoid ordering the thing you have always feared more than death itself, the judicial murder of an anointed Queen.
It will torment you to the end of your days.
Robin!
My lord.
I shall pray for your mistress, Elizabeth, at the moment of my death.
Madam, if your head had matched your heart
I would be the one awaiting death.
O Lord,
I put my trust in you.
Do not let me be confounded.
It is time, madam.
Do not weep. I am happy.
Yes, I am. I'm happy.
Goodbye, dear.
You have been so faithful to me.
I do thank you.
Pray for me.
In you, O Lord, have I put my trust.
For you, O Lord God, are the thing that I long for.
You are my hope even from my youth.
I am become, as it were, a monster to many, but my trust shall always be in you.
Oh, let my mouth be filled with your praise, that I may sing of your glory and honor all the day long.
Forsake me not when my strength fails me.
Go not far from me, O God.
My God, hasten to help me.
I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God.
My lips will be fain when I sing unto you and so will my soul whom you have delivered.
Forgive me, madam.
I forgive you with all my heart.
I thank you even. I hope this death shall put an end to all my troubles.
For in my end is my beginning.
Lord, into your hands
I commend my spirit.
The army of the Ottoman Empire was defeated by Iancu of Hunedoara in Belgrade.
Three days later the hero died of the plague in front of the freed citadel.
Taking advantage of this opportunity,
Mehmed II, the Conqueror of Constantinople, prepared to give Europe a deadly strike.
Weakened by fights for the throne among the successors of Mircea the Old and by the feudal anarchy of the great boyars,
Wallachia seemed an easy prey for the Conqueror.
Who are you?
We are free countrymen from near Targoviste.
We are going to Iancu de Hunedoara.
We want him to take us into his army.
I will lead you to Iancu's Captain.
He should decide.
Iancu de Hundoara is dead.
And with him died the promise of help.
I don't wait for anything from anyone.
The circumstances are favorable though the king and the sultan don't have time for Wallachia now.
I have been following you faithfully, since you were a child. Command me.
Go into villages.
Tell them the time has come for them to gather near the border of Wallachia.
Only those should come for whom liberty is more precious than life.
Judging by the riots of last winter,
I could gather the whole of Transylvania.
3000 Romanians are enough.
Death to Draculea!
Long live Your Highness!
- Who killed him?
- Me, Your Highness.
Did you have an arrangement?
I did it by myself.
I smoothed your way to the throne.
Bury him with the honors due to a lord.
And he... should perish by the spear he has killed with.
Why, Your Highness?
If I hadn't done it, you would.
I haven't sworn to be faithful to him.
Untie them.
Have you any news?
Yes, I have news.
Various factions are fighting for the throne and the country is in chaos.
As a successor of Mircea the Great you should know that.
Give him his sword.
You have carried it with honor.
Let us swear to be faithful to His Highness.
Tell me boyars
How many lords have sat on this throne since my grandfather Mircea died?
Six.
Seven, eight.
More, Your Highness.
Ten.
Not even you know how many.
You have urged the ones against the others.
You have impelled them to look abroad for help.
Us, Mircea Voievod lord of the whole Ungro-Wallachia country of the territories over the mountains of the Tartar territories and Prince of Amlas and Fagaras lord of Banat in Severin and on both sides of the Danube up to the big sea and sole lord of Dirstor Citadel... what happened to his inheritance?
Where are the territories?
Over the mountains?
Where are Amlas and Fagaras?
Where is the big sea?
Not even 50 years have passed since the lords were vassals to the King of Hungary, and tributaries to Mehmed.
Servants of two masters.
This is what this country has become as a consequence of your reckless actions.
Your Highness came to the country to kill the Lord and replace him,
The country is a shadow of what it used to be.
When I crossed the mountains I did not come against a country but against a shadow.
I came not to kill a Lord but the shadow of a shadow.
The Lords were helpless.
You have ruled after Mircea's death.
You have changed the Lords.
They did not know to hew you in time.
Do it Your Highness.
No.
I won't judge you now.
Too many heads would fall.
I am asking you one thing.
You have brought the country to where it is now, you take it to where it should be.
Let us take it, Your Highness.
- What is your command?
- Open the prison gates.
Those who were sentenced to death shall regain their lives.
Those who were imprisoned shall regain their freedom.
Everybody's mistakes will be forgiven, whatever they are.
From now on, all robberies, rapes, lies, treachery, will be punished by beheading.
Forgive me, Your Highness, this is good when taking the throne
But afterwards wouldn't it seem be too harsh?
Harsh?
Why harsh?
All souls should know what I am asking.
And what is waiting for them.
Each man should be his own judge.
To decide for himself if he stays or leaves this world.
And as he decides, so be it.
What could be more right than this?
He's right. This is fair.
And what else do you command,
Your Highness?
A new administration,
"Armashia".
To ensure the fulfillment of the royal orders.
Anything else?
That's enough for today.
Very good, Your Highness.
Let it be as you wish.
If this is your will...
Who will have the honor to be the armash?
You.
What should he oversee?
The princes and the country's council oversee everything.
It's not they who are in Your Highness's hands, but Your Highness who is in their hands.
Nobody should be watching over them?
Over the princes?
The council?
I don't want to see the country through their eyes, but to know it as it is.
I only have two hands and two eyes, and I would need a thousand.
A thousand good eyes are hard to gather.
Take 300 of the horsemen I came with.
Gather all the reliable men you know.
Spread them over the fairs, villages and roads.
Nothing should happen in the country without me knowing about it.
The boyars won't want them on their estates.
They can raise their flags and stand against me.
Who would I face them with?
With the princely army.
The princely army is made up of boyar's men.
There is no other princely army.
Haven't you seen it with your own eyes?
Haven't you had a rope around your neck?
Do you think I came here to play the prince?
I gave you a sword.
Handle it.
But be aware, it has 2 blades.
If you are a good man, don't be afraid.
If you're not, your head will fall first.
Too many strange things in one day.
But one has put an end to everything.
We have gone into battle with a prince and returned with another whom nobody wanted.
He had hardly been on the throne when he started to make bad decisions.
He is like a foal harnessed for the first time kicking and neighing.
This will last for a little while... but he will get used to the harness, the carriage and the coachmen.
Highway robbery.
They have stolen a few bales.
What did the guards do?
Exactly what they are doing right now.
We should have doubled the guards.
Here all the roads are insecure.
Bloody country!
We have been looking for you for an hour.
You taught me when I was a child to get out at dawn, and see how life and the country awake.
So early? Alone and without guards?
Without telling anyone?
Knowing full well how dangerous this is?
What shall I do if this is the lord's order?
Am I not supposed to obey?
Where are the councillors?
They come at noon, Your Highness.
This is the custom.
The custom?
Take the palace guards and go get them.
Three German merchants from Brasov want to see Your Highness.
They are waiting in the Chancellery.
- Are you a merchant or a captain?
- The roads are insecure, Your Highness, haunted by all kinds of dawdlers.
They beg during the day and steal at night.
Last night they killed a servant and stole some Turkish fabric and expensive cloths.
Four packs, Your Highness.
Ransack Targoviste and its surroundings.
Get the robbers.
You will get back all that has been taken from you.
Take the merchants of Brasov a letter to strengthen their privileges, so that you can pass through 
Wallachia without problems, towards the villages along the Danube.
The same for our merchants towards Brasov or other places.
This country has to grow very fast in order to be like other countries.
And you come at noon?
First your head and then the rest?
It is not your country, boyars.
You belong to this country.
And me as well,
I belong to this country.
One says Ladislau of Hungary, not Hungary of Ladislau,
Kazimir of Poland, not Poland of Kazimir.
If it weren't this way, the countries would perish with their lords, and with their boyars.
What happened, Your Highness?
Nothing happened.
This is a normal working day.
I want us to discuss the country's business, see what is to be done and do it.
The Turks rob near Giurgiu.
There was no agreement about the borders of Turkish counties.
In this way began all robberies in past years, from Giurgiu.
After that, they spread across the Danube, to Braila.
We must stop them.
Gather two thousand horsemen between Buzau and Braila.
We don't need war.
Let there be peace.
When you pay tribute to the sultan, tell him about this.
That's how Ottoman and Hungarian law was decided back in 1453, when the peace treaty was signed.
Silence boyars!
Who is in command here?
Me or you?
Let the Hungarians make war with the Turks if this is their wish, but not at our loss.
Who were the  boyars from the country's council of 1453?
We, and others...
Those of you who made the treaty should pay for this, not me, not the whole country.
Don't ask me to bring you tribute.
I'm King of Walachia, not some weak messenger.
If peace is broken because of Your Highness, both king and sultan will come for us.
The country hasn't enough power to stay against them.
How can a country be powerful, if it is divided into hundreds pieces?
Each of you considers himself a king on his own estate.
Each of you does what he wants.
In a country like this, you blow as a flame on a candle.
Free the army which you came with.
The horsemen are wandering about and disturbing the people.
No.
The horsemen will remain on Throne's Citadel, always ready.
They will be an army of mercenaries.
Why do we need an army like this?
The boyars army aren't enough?
Not anymore.
The Turkish soldiers are mercenaries.
That's why Turkey is so strong.
The Hungarians have this kind of army, too.
In our times, the mercenaries form the iron-strong core of the army.
They decide a war's fate.
-The country is poor.
-But you are wealthy!
Give the army all the men needed.
By free will.
Otherwise I'll send the army to your estates, to take for itself.
The country is poor?
Under Mircea the country wasn't like this.
How has it become poor since then?
I don't want there to be poor people in my country anymore.
Let's begin... to promote artisanry and commerce, because this is a country's source of wealth.
Both our craftsmen and commerce are weakened.
No strength at all.
Why?
How?
You don't know?
From today on, the merchants and craftsmen will obey only the king.
Those from the boyar's estates will respond in front of boyars.
Don't the boyar lands belong to Wallachia?
-There is the law of the land, Your Highness.
-Land is the same for everybody.
It feeds us... is patient with us, and protects us.
It's the only law known by the land.
Your Highness, what you're doing isn't good.
Boyars are the country's base.
If the foundation is weakened, the country is too.
All that I have decided today, is for the well-being of country.
If the country's well-being isn't yours too... tell me now.
I know what I have to do.
Enough for today.
You should be there again early tomorrow.
Don't play with fire you boyars!
Please, I beg you, with all my soul.
Don't do it.
He's a wild horse, not a foal as you said.
If we let him, he will ruin the harness and destroy the carriage.
When you arrive in Transylvania, go to him and do what I have told you.
In secret. Yes, Your Highness.
The robberies have escalated in 
Targoviste and the neighboring villages.
We have caught some robbers and we cut off their heads.
Others were hanged.
But many remain free,
Your Highness.
After today's punishment, they will lose their appetite. They are frightened.
No trace of fear.
Since this morning all beggars, all dawdlers are merry.
They toast to you and... sing obscene songs.
The carrying out of justice looks like a carnival.
- Let's choose only a few punishments.
- Which ones, and how?
They all have the same flaw.
They awaken the cruelty in people, not the honesty.
Fina a punishment that does not personalize the victory of the good which nobody finds out about, and from which they don't learn.
What there is to learn - is in vain.
What do you command,
Your Highness?
Get me all the robbers in the country.
I don't think this is possible,
Your Highness.
Many of them withdraw to the boyar's estates when they are cornered.
We have no power there, yet.
Hm... The boyars again.
It would have been better to cut them off, Your Highness.
We are going through Bran Pass.
Back up the convoy.
How is it? All four are untouched.
I didn't believe we'd ever see them again.
We are starting!
Start!
Come on!
Don't do anything else but what I told you.
Let there be everything in abundance!
Nothing should be missing from this princely feast.
And... Invite them all.
Come in, gentlemen!
Come in!
Let's drink to His Highness!
Long live Draculea. Long live the ringleader of the beggars!
Hey!
Let's get out of here.
Come, quickly!
You have something against me?
Why are you throwing me out?
I don't want to go.
Leave me there to dance.
Come, let's go outside.
Don't hit me, leave me alone!
Help! Help!
I want to remain.
- Are there any courageous men left inside?
- None. As you ordered, Your Highness.
Then finish the work.
Understood, Your Highness.
All 2000 horsemen are between Buzau and Braila and waiting for your orders.
Long life to you.
God help Your Highness!
We pray for Your health.
Are the roads to Targoviste properly guarded?
Yes, as you commanded.
But Targoviste was left undefended.
Maybe you shouldn't go to Braila and leave Targoviste in the boyars' hands.
- Don't you trust boyars?
- No.
God help us.
Or the Devil...
Stay in peace.
It is boiling...
What are you making here?
Meat soup, Your Highness.
Throw out the foam, otherwise the food will lose its taste.
There are times when even a nation's garbage wants to rise.
If it isn't thrown out, it weakens the nation's strength and deforms it.
For these kinds of things a spoon is not enough.
I'll allow it to rise.
I'll even help it.
But I'll not let it go where it wants, but where it deserves, instead.
He's on the way.
Stephen?
I'm glad you called me.
With whom do we fight?
With Petru Aron.
But only you.
You should be at Suceva before he knows.
On the Moldavian throne.
Take the army.
I gathered it just for you.
- The Lower Country wants me as lord.
- I know.
First try to make peace and order in the country. to secure peace at the borders.
Something has changed since Constantinople's fall.
We are trapped between the sultan and Hungary's king.
When they want to conquer, to oppress, to take what is not theirs, there is no difference between
Christians and Pagans.
Soon each of them will try to subdue us, smiling and telling us... they want to protect us the other one.
There will be a bitter struggle.
Maybe it will last hundreds of years.
There's no wall that can protect us.
The walls of our resistance should be inner ones.
In each of us.
- With this I've finished.
- I have not!
You spoke to me as to a lord,
I'll answer you as a lord.
Mountains protect me from the king of Hungary.
I have a chain of citadels.
The Hotin, The Orhei,
Tighina, Soroca,
Alba Citadel all protect me from
Tatar invasions.
Moldavia is safe, like in armor, but one piece is still missing.
Chilia.
Now it's yours.
I want it back.
Without Chilia the heart of country is exposed to Mohamed.
The citadel is mine just theoretically.
After Iancu's death the King of Hungary replaced his soldiers with a garrison.
If I give it back to you, it will give the king a motive to start a war, and I'm not prepared for this.
I will take it by sword.
You are not ready too.
Let's wait... a while, make it seem like a fight between us.
In this way nobody will be upset.
On the other hand, there are the boyars.
They want to crown their own king.
They promise the sultan double tribute if he supports their choice.
I asked for those horsemen to weaken their army, not for starting a war with the Turks.
Now do you understand why?
I wanted nobody to perish.
God is my witness.
It's their choice.
I'm going to scour my land.
- What is going on here?
- What you see.
Govora is a princely monastery.
-Who dared to touch it?
-Me!
And with me the entire country's great princes.
I took out the sword to defend the boyar's privileges.
We want Albu as our prince.
You'll pay with your head.
Draculea can't get here sooner than three days.
In three days we'll be ten times as many.
There are also the 2000 horsemen who are on his side.
When they see what is going on, they will raise their swords against him and will be ready to fight.
Do you understand now why I gave them to him?
To be the one who kills him.
Draculea! Draculea is coming!
Get out of my way!
Protect us, Your Holiness!
We are inside the holy church, Your Highness.
They should have come to the holy church before, not after!
You shall not murder!
Love thy neighbor as you love yourself, lead his soul towards righteousness.
I have to lead the country towards righteousness.
Your Holiness should take care of the souls.
They are the business of every shepherd.
Each shepherd with his pipe.
From Your Highness's pipe comes a pagan sound.
Thou shalt not steal.
Thou shalt not murder.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house or anything that belongs to him.
For all to go well with you.
Do the holy commandments sound like this or not?
You have learned them, Your Highness, but you didn't understand them.
Have I ever done otherwise than being said?
Have I ever punished for a different flaw?
From your holiness's pipe comes pagan sounds, when you want to protect the lawless.
God does not wish for the sinner's death.
But for his righteousness, I know.
But if they are commandments, let them be commandments.
In order to convert ten sinners into righteous men, one man should die.
In order to convert 100, ten must perish.
Serving as an example.
In vain you ask the thief not to steal, the killer not to kill.
Asking does not accomplish anything.
It is not the love of God brings people to the church, but fear of the hell's throes.
And Your Highness wants to embody them?
If you heed my orders five of you will kill 100
A hundred will banish 10,000 and enemies will die by the sword in front of you.
If you don't heed my orders...
I will come with rage and punish you seven times for your sins.
You will perish, the land of your enemies will swallow you
Do you want me to wait cross-handed for this punishment which means the country's death?
Mehmed is close. The country should confront him like an invincible steel sword.
Swords are hardened through fire, not words, your holiness.
-But not in hell's fire.
-I haven't another handy.
Impale them! For the whole country to see and learn!
From now on, this will be the only punishment.
The stake is for the lowest scum.
There are also boyars here, Your Highness.
Are there? Then mark my words: don't put the prince near the craftsman, the robber near the monk, and the boyar near the common people.
Give each the stake appropriate to his class.
I want to be seen from afar that my justice is the same for all!
Beg him to cut off my head.
He is my brother.
Do you want him by your side?
It is possible in one way: with you by his side.
I didn't want it,
I don't want.
But it is needed.
How else to separate the wheat from the chaff?
I made everybody his own judge.
I've put the scales of justice in their hands.
But for some of them, the scale has just one pan.
To swing impaled, if they want.
The sooner, the better.
A rotten apple will spoil all the others.
I must not hesitate.
I must not blink.
If I don't do this, everything will be lost.
My God...
Why me?
Your duty is to watch my sleep, not disturb it.
It is a miracle we escaped.
You said you wanted to trap him and we all fell into his trap.
Look what has become of us: no fortunes and no estates.
All we have left are our clothes.
I lost more than you did.
- It is good that my head is on my shoulders.
- What use can you make of it?
Yes, one of Mircea the Old's men is here in Transylvania, watching the throne.
We'll go to him, gather an army, and return to Targoviste led by him.
Everything we lost will be ours again and even more.
On your horses!
We need to appoint new prince.
According to the custom I should name them.
I could also let you choose them.
I won't do either.
Each of you should ponder on a choice and take the office he feels worthy for.
Think about it very well, thou.
Those who choose themselves improperly,
I will get nearer to heaven.
And they will be the ones to blame.
Judge.
Treasurer.
Council Head.
Come on!
Let's get out of this hole.
-Who are you?
-But you?
Szilagi's soldiers.
-You?
-Merchants from Wallachia.
-What you have in the carriages?
-Steel.
What a shame.
I think you are men of the King.
-What do you have against the King?
-Ladislau must leave the throne!
The Kingdom of Hungary's crown is for Iancu of Hunedoara.
Iancu gave us fame.
Now all Christendom respects us much more.
His successors should be our Kings, not an incompetent.
Szilagyi has sworn not to put the sword into the sheath until he replaces the king with Iancu's son.
And it will be as Szilagyi wants.
Aside from the powerful counts, we all are on his side.
Should be mister,
I said otherwise?
- Are you passing through Brasov?
- Yes, through Brasov.
Take care, they are are loyal to the King.
The Brasovenians have stopped the carriages and imprisoned the merchants.
Why?
Szilagy's revolt has extended in whole downside of Transylvania.
Because of this we cannot give back the carriages to His Highness.
Neither Valahia nor our Lord has anything to do with Szilagy's revolt.
You didn't make any effort to stop it.
As King's vassal His Highness should intervene.
If he doesn't, this means he's on the side of the rebels.
The goods of the rebels or their supporters are being seized by the King.
His Highness never agreed to any covenant of vassalage with Hungary's King.
This is one more evidence that His Highness is against the King.
We do not say this.
But the high royal princes say this.
So... as a proof of our benevolence we'll free the merchants.
But we can't free the carriages no matter how much we want.
The King will take us as rebels.
Regarding those fugitive boyars that His Highness demands, we can't touch them for the same reasons.
As long as they are in Transylvania they are under the King's protection.
His Highness must ask for them from the King.
Mhm, so this is the gratitude of merchants from Brasov?
They want to force us to buy tools and armament from them, for which we pay ten times more.
That's why they attacked us and our iron and steel crafting.
Let's take away their privileges.
No.
When you are pushed to get back what you gave with one hand, you ought to take back with the other one.
The carriages are worth 100 times less than our merchandise.
Take their chariots and give us the merchandise.
From now on you won't pass the customs at Wallachia with merchandise that can be found in our country as well.
You won't pass however much, but as much as merchant from my country will go to Brasov or through there towards other places.
Oxen, horses, wax, fabrics, copper, silver, iron - are all found in Wallachia.
What else will we sell to the Turks?
Silver and gold lace?
You shouldn't have stopped the carts.
Dracula was kind with us.
To a hand which reaches out to you, you don't answer with a fist.
We had to stop them.
This road links the West and the East.
What passes through our hands, must stay in our hands.
If we share it, we share the earnings, the wealth and the power.
There is no road.
Dracula cut it.
He cut it wrong.
The Turks sell veils to us, gems, carpets, silk, lemon, rice, spices, oil.
Can we find any of this merchandise in Wallachia?
Buy all Turkish merchandise from the Danube.
Fill up the warehouses.
If we do not give merchandise in exchange, we lose profit.
We'll raise the prices in the West and blame Dracula for that.
Wherever you go, tell everyone that he is a tyrant, a devil thirsting for blood and his only pleasure is to impale innocent people.
Tell them that he is feasting in front of the stakes, and finds great pleasure in seeing them suffering.
Tell them he burnt the poor, instead of being charitable.
Tell them he slaughtered 300 merchants from 
Brasov together with their wives and children.
The merchants don't walk on the roads with women and children, like the gypsies.
Everybody knows that.
Tell them once, twice or a hundred times and they will end up believing you.
Picture him as a demon, an evil spirit.
Turn the whole of Christendom against him.
You slander a man.
You want to cover one evil with another.
There is plenty of room for all merchants from Brasov or Wallachia.
Send the carts with steel to Targoviste.
A delegation should go apologize and everything should be as it used to.
There is a war here, without swords and spears.
In any war there is no room for both us and them.
The law of war is one: either us or them.
How do we get to the Danube?
He won't allow all our merchants to pass.
Only a few.
It is enough that one of ours should pass.
He will buy for all.
Dad, why do they call him Draculea?
How else? Draculea - the son of Dracul (the devil), as they used to call his father - Vlad Dracul.
- Was he a devil?
- He was a man. A good man.
If he was a good man, why did they call him Dracul?
Because he had a dragon around his neck.
What dragon?
Why are you fooling the boy?
-That was "dracon".
-Dragon. That's how call it His Highness.
He had received it from the Germans and it was a sign of great honor.
Dad!
What do you want?
Was it a dragon or not?
It was as your grandad says, because he had been in the princely guards and knows better.
Silk, fabric. Buy cheap raisins!
What is their price?
The same as ours.
The road is closed with 7 locks.
Only a sword could reopen it.
Let's open it by sword.
Us?
No.
To his majesty, the King of Hungary.
Who gave us the Duchy of Amlas and Fagaras.
Cheers!
Cheers!
Gentlemen!
Thank your king for his support in conquering the throne of Wallachia, which as a grandson of Mircea
I have the right to possess.
I will wait patiently the right time.
You have now all the high ranks,
Your Highness.
You have also chosen your administration.
It is a real princely court.
Just one thing is missing: the country.
But it will come...
Until then, address your needs to the brave German merchants, who will help you.
What do you decide, Your Highness?
How can you make the most of what was given to us?
We must gather an army and this means great expense.
Didn't you hear?
The German merchants will administer Amlas and Fagaras.
It is the king's will.
Let them be bothered.
To us they will assure our basic needs and soldiers. When the time comes.
- What are we supposed to do, Your Highness?
- We'll go hunting.
Look how far they pushed their bravery.
If Mircea the Old could knew that foreign kings give Romanian land as reward to those with royal blood in exchange for their loyalty he would turn 7 times in his grave.
Let's send a messenger to the King.
To ask him to drive these pretenders to the throne out of our borders.
Why do you push the king in this matter?
You looked at the documents from the office?
Is there a treaty between us and king to let him have Amlash or the Fagarash?
None.
Surround the castle!
Your Highness's cousin is running pretty fast.
Quick, to Targosviste. Let His Highness know!
Manzila, take half of the country's army, join them with those from Targosviste and smash the Turks.
A messenger from Szilagyi.
Szilagyi is sending word to Your Highness that the king has asked for an armistice.
Your cause with the merchants from Brasov will be judged as well.
Their delegation will go to Sighisoara.
Let yours come as well.
Johanes Reuden - messenger of the bourg of Brasov.
The messengers of Wallachia.
Mihai Szilagyi- captain of Belgrade citadel.
His excellency Albert, royal vice-chancellor,
Prepositor of the Archishop of Agria.
I have largely exposed the injustice done to the brave merchants of Brasov, the persecutions they have been subjected to.
The cruelty of Dracula has shaken the Christian world.
If he would meet the Savior himself, he would crucify Him a second time.
Why don't you say something about what the merchants did against Wallachia?
They had to respond to the persecutions that overwhelmed them.
First he showed them understanding and goodwill.
What they got is what they have asked for.
We know the cause.
You don't need to say it once again.
You know it from the people of Brasov.
Nobody listened to us.
My people spoke for you.
You will give the people of Brasov their former privileges back.
You will give them back all the merchandise you have taken from them.
Also, we oblige them to give you back the carts with steel.
Let's make peace.
Amen.
We will respect this armistice if His Majesty the King won't dispose otherwise.
We are not signing.
First he should send away the pretenders at the borders.
So that our merchants in Brasov have the same rights as the ones in Wallachia.
Our brother Vlad  is right.
The things he asks will assure peace at the borders of Transylvania.
His will is my own.
Either we do as he wants or we don't sign the armistice.
What did you say?
The armistice is for 3 months.
For how long have you given them back their privileges?
For three months.
Where is it so written? Where?
They will think it is forever.
I sent you to sign an armistice, and you signed a peace treaty?
That is why I came here to see you?
For that I was sleepless?
What happened to you?
You gave me my sword, Your Highness, but not the wisdom required for a royal job.
Dismiss me from this rank and name someone who is more competent.
What do you think that serving the country is?
An inn where you go in and out as you please?
There is no turning back here, for anybody.
There is only one way forward or up.
You know where...
- Shall  prepare it, Your Highness?
- Not yet.
Sir Benedict of Boytor, messenger of Hungary's King.
Ladislau.... is dead.
Matthias Corvinus is now King of Hungary.
We wish Matthias to give greatness and glory to the people who have chosen him.
Like Iancu of Hunedoara did in his time.
His glorious father.
We shall do all in our power to make a durable peace.
A righteous one.
His Majesty, protector of Christianity, wants from Your Majesty to make at Budapest the covenant of vassalage.
Vassalage? What it this?
This is too much.
His Majesty has just ascended the throne.
He doesn't protect anybody yet.
I'm the king of a country which is free and I want it to stay as it is.
I'm an ally and brother in arms against the dangers that threaten us both.
But not vassal.
I'll never be a vassal to anybody.
Never!
The day riding, the night riding.
No home.
I am sick of this job.
It happens to all princes. We all are tired.
You can't say that His Highness spares us or is very grateful.
We will both end up impaled.
I know.
Are you okay with this?
I have no choice.
You can always choose.
We only live once.
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.
Both of us will die just before we make a move.
This can be done without danger.
The others will kill us, afterwards.
The boyars who don't want a war against the Turks are on our side.
- How many?
- Enough.
Those in Amlas and Fagaras will be with us as soon as we let them know.
They know how to be grateful.
-Why don't they do that?
-They can't do it.
The guards are with him all the time.
It is easier for us to find him alone.
The best thing would be when he is saying his prayers.
Does he pray?
For hours, at night.
How do we do it?
Good morning, boyars.
Welcome.
Throw away your swords.
Did you take care of what is necessary?
As you ordered, Your Highness.
Don't let them wait.
They must be tired after such work.
You have chosen wrong, magistrate.
This is car 2118.
Call Greenpoint Hospital.
We're bringing in a wounded cop.
All right, 10-4.
8th Precinct.
Jesus Christ.
Guess who got shot.
Serpico.
You think a cop did it?
I know six cops said they'd like to.
Hello.
New York Times.
Serpico's been shot.
Oh, my God!
- They're taking him to Greenpoint.
- I'll see you there.
To be a police officer means to believe in the law...
and to enforce it impartially... respecting the equality of all men... and the dignity and worth of every individual.
Every day, your life will be on the line... and also your character.
You'll need integrity, courage, honesty... compassion, courtesy... and perseverance... and patience.
You men are now prepared to join the war against crime... and put the theory you have learned into practice in the streets.
Same time, same place... both reports.
I already made out a 424.
- You covering this, Lieutenant?
- Yes, Chief Green.
Who was with Serpico?
- Heinemann and Julio.
- I want them interrogated.
I want this conducted as an official departmental investigation.
Transcripts by 9:00 a.m.
Another thing...
I want a 24-hour guard on Serpico.
- Yes, sir.
- You two, over there.
Anthony Sardo.
Ralph Seidler.
Frank Serpico.
Come on.
Marianne wants a good shot.
Get closer!
Patrolman Serpico.
Upstairs.
See the roll-call man.
Memorize your posts and sectors.
This week you're 8:00 to 4:00.
Next week, 4:00 to midnight.
Grab a locker.
Any questions, older guys will fill you in. Good luck.
Yo! 8:00.
Let's go! Come on!
Gather around. Let's go.
All right. Settle down.
All right. Just a few announcements today and two new men.
On the board on my left, you see squad one, blue sector... squad two, red sector... squad three, green sector.
Now, we want summonses, summonses, summonses.
I'll help the boys, Florence.
- This is Frank Serpico, Charlie.
- Hello, Frank.
- Hello, Charlie.
- How about some creamed chicken?
- Sounds good to me.
- No, I think I'll have...
How about a roast beef on roll?
Yeah, okay. You go through the line. I'll bring it over.
Peluce, it's all fat here.
- I saw real lean beef over there.
- Take it easy.
Sit down, sit down.
- What's the matter?
- Don't be so fussy. It's free.
Well, I'm not fussy.
I don't know how I'm gonna eat this.
Charlie's okay. We give him a break on double parking on deliveries.
Couldn't I pay for it, get what I want?
Frank, generally, you just sort of take what Charlie gives you.
Sector D-David, 1034, possible rape in progress...
vicinity of PS 218,
Grand Avenue and BQ Expressway.
Becker, aren't we gonna take that?
Relax, Frank.
It's not our sector.
It's on the borderline.
I'm gonna take it.
D sector, 1547, 10-4.
Oh, my God!
Hold it! Hold it!
Police officers!
Oh, shit!
- Come on. Give us...
- Don't shoot now.
Be cool.
All right. Okay.
Put your guns away.
Put your guns away, man.
Come on. Goddamn it!
I said put them motherfucking guns away!
I'll cut her, goddamn it.
Turn the motherfucking light out, man.
I'll cut her, man.
I'll cut her.
Now, you just be cool, goddamn it.
Just be cool. All right.
All right. All right.
That's it.
The other one took his thing out.
He put it up to my mouth.
He... He held me down.
They said if I didn't do it... they'd kill me.
She's gonna make a hell of a witness.
Would you like a stretcher?
Muscles, he's all yours.
I'll call you from the hospital.
Okay, hard-on.
Who were your playmates?
Hey, Frank, you want a piece of this?
No. I'm gonna fill out the arrest card.
Hey, Charlie, let me have five minutes with him.
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Thank you, Charlie.
That prick really worked you over.
How do you feel?
How come you didn't stay for the fun?
That's not my kind of fun.
Shit.
I want to talk to you.
I want to take you across the street, get you a cup of coffee... without cuffs.
Now, look. I didn't touch you upstairs, right?
You take off on me,
I'll put one in your back.
Understand?
Come on.
It's a goddamn shame you gotta take this whole rap yourself.
I don't know. Maybe you're guilty, maybe you're not.
Maybe you just went along for the ride.
I got a feeling you just went along.
But you're the one who got caught.
You never even got your cock out.
- Put it in the report.
- It's in the report.
Look at you.
- I can't eat.
- No, you can't.
I don't understand you, you know that?
What are you, obligated to those guys?
Fuck it.
They left you holding the bag.
You don't owe them nothin'.
They're gonna put you away, you know that?
What can I get?
Oh, let's see... kidnapping... sodomy, rape...
Are you kidding me?
You talk to me.
Save yourself.
Let it go, Harv!
Take the shot.
You not gonna send someone over?
Look, look.
McCoy, I get one,
I'm gonna lose the other.
Look, Serpico, that's Muscles' case.
He's off for a couple days.
- I can't cut in, Frank.
- They're here now!
- It'll keep.
- No, it won't!
Police officer!
Hold it! Hold it!
Turn around. Turn around.
- Ow!
- Spread!
Come on, man. Come on.
Please take that gun from my head.
Turn around slow.
We'll take it from here, kid.
You don't have to hang around.
What are you talking about?
That's my collar.
We take the collar.
A collar like this, don't look good, a patrolman takes it.
Wait a minute.
I don't care how it looks.
Now, I did the work. I broke my ass on this. It's my collar.
You really want the collar, kid?
You can be brought up on charges.
Left your post, the street, entered the school yard without permission...
That's just for openers.
Right, Penella?
No memo entry. Shit. You'll be lucky to end up with a reprimand.
We'll give you an assist on the arrest, kid.
Come on, Frankie!
Jim, get out of the way!
What are you doing?
What you want me to do?
Go across the street?
- Hey, Frank.
- Hi, Uncle Will. How you doing?
- Hey, Pasquale.
- Hey, Frankie! How you doing?
Okay. How you doing?
Where's Pop?
Be back in a half hour.
How's it going, Frankie?
Okay.
I come to get my shoes.
Rev it up. Rev it up!
- Here they are.
- Frankie, how you doing?
Okay. Good job.
You people do good work here.
So, how you doing, Frankie?
You keep asking me that. What's the matter with you? I'm doing okay!
Well, I thought you were coming over to the house Saturday night.
I'm sorry, Pasquale.
I couldn't make it.
Margaret invited Marianne over.
Marianne was very disappointed...
Now, look. I don't like that.
I mean, really.
Don't invite people over if you're not sure I'm gonna come.
I mean it, now. If I want to see Marianne, I'll call her.
What's going on with you two anyway?
Hey, Pasquale,
I'm gonna tell you something.
See, all day long,
I work with cops. Right?
Now, when I go out,
I see Marianne... her father's a cop, her brother's a cop, her uncle's a cop.
- I got a feeling she's a cop too.
- Come here!
- How you doing on the job?
- It's got its problems.
Mama tells me that you're looking for a new apartment. Is that true?
- Yeah.
- So, where are you going?
I don't know.
I'm looking around by school.
NYU? Greenwich Village?
- Yeah, Greenwich Village.
- What's the matter?
The old neighborhood's not good enough for ya?
Tell Pop I was here.
Frankie, Sunday?
Sunday what?
Dinner? Huh?
- Do me one favor... no Marianne.
- I know. No Marianne.
All right.
A couple of announcements.
"Announcing a course in fingerprint identification... to be given at John Jay College.
This course will be available to those patrolmen... who wish to make themselves eligible for assignment... to the Bureau of
Criminal Identification, BCI... which is generally considered to be a path to a detective's gold shield.
Signed, Captain McGuire."
On the board on my left, you see squad one...
Hot enough for ya?
It's not the heat.
It's the humidity.
I had a feeling you were gonna say that.
You know how long you're taking on that one?
Check one print category, two...
That's plenty.
I'm not gonna give a guy a
"no record" when he might have one.
How long you been with the BCI now, Serpico?
All my life.
That's long enough to know how we do things.
Barto, it's not just that.
You don't like me.
BCI never had a weirdo cop before.
Barto, stop buggin' me.
Mama?
Wanna buy a puppy?
Look at that, huh?
Where'd you get these dogs?
Oh, they're mine.
Want one for free?
- I'll pay for it. How much?
- Five dollars.
You got it.
Okay, now which one of you guys wanna come with me?
What?
Come on.
- Could you do me a favor?
- What?
Just watch the car and my stuff over here, 'cause I'm movin' in.
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Don Quixote.
Señorita Land?
Mr. Serpico.
I got my horse here.
Maybe I could drop you someplace.
Well, I'm going to work at the Café Reggio.
Café Reggio.
- That's 4th Street and...
- MacDougal and 3rd.
- Can I give you a lift?
- Yeah. Sure.
Jesus, what's that?
You got your hands on my money belt. Don't do that.
That's not a money belt.
That's a gun.
- Well, we gotta eat, don't we?
- Oh, come on!
- What do you need a gun for?
- Ever hear of Barnum and Bailey?
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm their lion tamer.
- Come on.
- That's the truth.
- I think you're full of shit.
- You do, huh?
- What do you do?
- Me?
I'm an actress, a singer, a dancer and a Buddhist.
In that order?
- I'm a cop. Would you believe that?
- No, I wouldn't believe it.
Those leaps that guy made, what do you call 'em again?
Jetés.
You try it.
All right. How do you start it?
What's your position?
Next life. Come on.
What are you reading now,
Serpico?
My Life by Isadora Duncan.
She was a ballet dancer.
A belly dancer?
No. No, a ballet dancer.
Ballet.
- You know ballet?
- A little.
- A little bit? You ever see one?
- Not close.
I've been to the ballet.
It's terrific.
- I've been taking classes.
- Oh, yeah?
That's where I go after I leave here.
Fantastic for your body.
Really builds you up.
- I can tell.
- You noticed, huh?
I noticed.
There's five positions.
Five pos...
You're being shortchanged.
- Oh, no. It's enough. Believe me.
- For what?
Watch. See?
This is the first position.
From this position,
I can do anything.
- You want to see?
- Sure.
Here we go.
Bye, Barto!
- Lieutenant Steiger...
- No, no. Later.
- Hey, turn off the lights.
- Potts, I wanted to read.
Positions, positions!
Positions like that you don't see in a pretzel factory.
Now I gotta do my pee-pee in the dark.
She's gotta be a nympho with positions like that.
Hey, Serpico, how can you piss at a time like this?
Barto wants a specimen.
I'm gonna look into this matter.
- What do you got there?
- Here.
Straight ahead.
- Straight ahead where?
- Third window down.
- I don't see anything over there.
- Let me see.
She just pulled down the shade.
- You gotta be some kind of jinx.
- That's right. Blame me.
Hold it, Serpico.
What were you two doing?
- What?
- In the shithouse in the dark!
Were you goin' down on him?
- What are you talking about?
- You gonna tell me you were peeping?
You were sucking his cock, weren't you?
- What are you, crazy?
- I'll show you fuckin' crazy!
Last week I found a pair of shorts with semen on 'em!
There!
You actually accusing me of this?
Good morning, Captain McClain.
I'm Officer Serpico.
I was told I could talk to you, sir.
Certainly, son.
Come in.
Lieutenant Steiger won't make a report.
He's too concerned with the image of his department.
But it... it could affect your future in the BCI.
Sir, I tell you...
Frankly,
I don't see any future there.
It was bullshit about it being a path toward being detective... because I've been there two years now...
And you want a transfer.
Yes, sir, but I don't wanna go back to uniform.
I'll see what I can do, Frank.
Francis, do you know about my weekend retreats for Catholic officers?
Well, you read that.
It might be of interest to you.
You are Catholic?
- Yeah. I was baptized, yes.
- Good, good.
Alfie, come on.
I missed you, baby.
She's so crazy, that girl,
I tell you.
Why Paco?
All my friends call me Paco.
Could you do me a favor?
- Get my keys out of this pocket.
- Sure.
Well, what'll I call you...
Frank or Paco?
Sally! Larry!
This is Paco.
- Hey, man.
- Larry's a poet.
But he works for an advertising agency.
Sally's an actress, but works for a photographer.
Paco's a policeman.
That's terrific.
I work for the police department.
- That's really nice.
- Wow.
See ya.
- How are you?
- Pat's a novelist.
But you're working for an insurance company now, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. Paco's a policeman.
Really? How exciting!
Well, not too.
Right now, I'm filing fingerprints.
Listen,
I file insurance policies.
We should get together then, file or something.
- That was an improvement.
- I wanna ask you something.
How come all your friends are on their way to being somebody else?
Think about that. I wanna ask you something else too.
Will you do me a big favor?
Don't tell anybody I'm a cop.
You know, let me just sort of do it myself.
Okay.
Hey, man, are you really a cop?
- Right. I am.
- Wow.
You know,
Leslie is a mind fucker.
You gotta be kidding.
I didn't know that.
What's a mind fucker?
Well, that's a chick... who digs intellectual types and super-bright guys.
Oh, yeah?
Well, she's very perceptive.
You know, Japanese culture and theater and painting... it's too rigidly stylized.
Well, yeah, you know...
Yeah, but...
I think after a while, when you get through that... you start to appreciate the clarity... you know, the authority.
I got a sheep dog.
There have been sheep dogs in my family... dating back... for 16 generations...
- Dating back to the Borgias.
- Oh, shit!
The family crest... is a sheep dog pissing into a gondola.
Oh, shit!
Paco, everybody loves you!
I love you!
Hey, Lieutenant, my wife call for me?
Give her this, will ya?
Officer Serpico reporting, sir.
That fucking thing on your lip, it goes. And get a haircut.
- Sir...
- That's an order.
You look like an asshole with dentures.
- Do I have the right of appeal, sir?
- Sure. Go see Captain Tolkin.
You got one foot in shit already.
Put the other one in.
Where might that be,
I wonder, sir?
Thank you, sir.
That is one hell of a mustache.
I wish I had the guts.
Well, I have what I consider to be good reasons for wearing it, sir.
- You don't have to tell me.
- But I'd like to tell ya, sir.
I thought so.
I think it's time that we started to communicate more on the streets.
You know, the way it is, we're totally isolated, sir.
We're completely out of touch with what's happening.
An undercover cop walks around in disguise... wearing black shoes and white socks.
Everybody knows who he is.
You made your point.
I want you to keep your mustache.
And I'd like you to patrol in your own car.
Wear whatever you want.
How does that strike you?
I'd like that, sir.
To be honest,
I'm bucking for detective.
No shit.
Hold it!
What the hell are you doing?
Oh, Christ!
Quick. Get against there.
Hey!
I'm a police officer!
Get over there!
Hey! It's me, Serpico!
Hey, I'm a police officer!
Police officer!
Poli... I'm an officer!
I'm a police officer!
Jesus, Frank, how was I supposed to recognize you?
- You stupid fuck.
- Frank, I didn't know you!
You didn't know me?
You fire without looking?
You fire without a warning, without a fucking brain in your head?
Oh, shit.
If I buy one, you motherfucker,
I'm not gonna buy it from you.
Holy shit.
Look at that mess.
Filling out forms till next month.
Good.
Hey, Jesus, Frank...
I know it's a hell of a time to ask you... but I'm gonna have to go through all that ballistics bullshit...
Good. You should.
It's gonna look like hell if I don't have anything to show for it.
Frank, do me a favor.
Give us the collar.
You motherfucker.
You want the collar, huh? You don't wanna fill out forms, right?
Here.
- You're a buddy.
- I'm a buddy.
Only you tell Tolkin
I gave it to you.
I am passing out these marijuana cigarettes for you to sample... so that when you become plainclothesmen... you'll be able to identify the pungent aroma... and recognize the disorienting effect of the drug... when you observe them in narcotics suspects.
Among users of the drug... a marijuana cigarette... is referred to as reefer... stick, roach, joint.
The drug itself is referred to as pot... tea, boo... stuff, grass.
Hey, this is real good shit.
- I gotta have something to eat.
- Oh, look what it is.
Look what it is.
It's a potato factory is what it is.
And I have to have some, and I love you... I love it.
Have some of that. We have nothing to... I have to have a dime?
The dime goes in the little slot there.
That doesn't work.
It's from the Civil War, this machine.
- Pull on it.
- Doesn't, doesn't, doesn't...
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Shoot it out. Please!
I beg of you! Come out!
Potatoes, come out!
You're pretty fuckin' weird for a cop.
Me? You!
- What about you, buddy? You!
- You're the weird guy. Me?
- You're a fuckin' hippie.
- It's beautiful, though.
The two of us.
Give me.
Where you supposed to go from here?
93 Precinct, plainclothes.
Put your gun away.
You?
I am scheduled to go on special assignment... with the mayor's department of investigations, detective squad.
- That's gold shield.
- Yeah.
No four years in plainclothes?
Who do you know?
I make it my business to know people... people who can help.
Unfair.
Unfair.
Life is unfair, pal.
I mean, look, you've got a feel for the streets, and I...
- I've got a feel for the politics.
- Oh, yeah?
You and me in a Batmobile, we could clean up the whole city in no time.
I wonder if we can get candy out of this machine though.
No, thanks.
Well, this is a good place to tell you, Paco.
You know that guy in Texas
I was telling you about?
- What about him?
- I'm gonna marry him in two months... unless you marry me.
What about the theater and your dancing?
A girl has to get married sometime.
Well, you're a long way from sometime, Leslie.
I thought you were committed.
I am, but...
You are, but?
I can go on working, studying there.
Where? Fort Worth?
Amarillo.
Well, am I invited to the wedding?
I'll ask Roy.
Yeah, it's pretty good in this precinct.
Here you go.
Usually a 9:00 to 5:00 day is the best time for policy and bookmaking.
If you have to work nights, like a liquor violation, just call in.
Don't worry about quotas right now.
Couple of hooker collars will keep it cool.
Been holding this for you.
It's from Jewish Max.
First day on the precinct,
I get that.
This is great, Frank.
I can open up a whole can of peas with this.
It's scary.
I wanna protect myself.
- You know what we do with this?
- What?
We take it to
Inspector Kellogg.
Kellogg... Didn't he used to be in plainclothes?
He's the second-highest ranking cop in the department of investigations.
- So what?
- What do you mean, "so what?"
I happened to be instrumental in getting the man his job.
He owes me.
You understand?
He's the most honest cop
I know, Frank.
Frank, trust me.
Things like this were common practice in the bad old days.
Hard to believe it's still going on.
Serpico, don't you think it's kind of stupid... taking an envelope from somebody you didn't know?
What was I supposed to do?
I mean, give me...
How would I know what was in it unless I took it?
You have two alternatives.
You can force me to take you to the commissioner of investigations.
He'll drag you in front of a grand jury.
- I don't want that.
- I can understand that.
Word will get out.
Before it's all over, they'll find you face-down in the East River.
- What's the other alternative?
- Forget it.
Well, what do I do with this?
Hey, Sarge?
You got a minute?
Colored cop gave me this.
I didn't know what to do with it.
Well, I'll send it on to the Benevolent Association.
Alfie, come on.
Is that Bjoerling?
No. It's DiStefano.
I was sure it was Bjoerling.
You could hear it better over here.
- That's an invitation, right?
- Right.
For coffee.
I'll have to take a rain check.
I'm due at the hospital.
Why don't you call in sick?
Perfect place.
Not me.
What are you, dedicated or somethin'?
That's right, I'm dedicated.
Most men can't stand it.
- Well, what do they know?
- I like your garden.
Love my garden.
Okay. I love your garden.
You know what they say, don't you?
No. What do they say?
If you love a man's garden, you gotta love the man.
You like her, Alfie?
All I can tell you, sir, is I gave it back.
I gotta get out of the 93.
Well, what happened on your narcotics application?
Looked like it was set, until
I told 'em I was in plainclothes.
It was like the kiss of death.
They think everybody in clothes is on the take.
Sir, do you know anything about the Bronx 7th Division?
I can go there if I want, but if it's the same shit, screw it.
I'd rather answer phones for Spanish communications unit and go nuts.
Come on, Alfie.
Frank, did anyone ever tell you... that you have a tendency toward self-pity?
No, you're the first.
All right. Frank, I have a friend up there, Roy Palmer.
He's an administrative officer.
I'll speak with him.
- Good. Thank you, sir.
- Good-bye, Frank.
- God bless you.
- Right.
Frank, Captain McClain here.
Captain McClain. Could you hold on a minute please, sir?
Sure.
Yeah. Sorry.
I saw Inspector Palmer tonight... and he assures me the 7th Division is as clean as a hound's tooth.
His words, Frank.
"Clean as a hound's tooth."
I told him he was getting a hardworking officer... wears a beard, speaks Spanish and would make a superb undercover man.
He was delighted.
That's good news, sir.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Good-bye, Frank.
God bless.
When did you start doing that?
McClain says that Palmer says... that the 7th is as clean as a hound's tooth.
Well, if that's true, your problems are over.
Plainclothes division.
Upstairs.
- How are you? Good to see you!
- All right.
We heard you were coming up here. Listen.
Say hello to Nate Smith.
Frank Serpico.
- Jamie Morales, Frank Serpico.
- Serpico?
Hey, babe, you're gonna love it up here. It's beautiful.
Listen, take...
I'll see youse later, all right?
Take a little ride with me.
Get the feel of the division.
- Maybe I should check in first.
- Fuck that. Come on.
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Ten grand, Dallas... if Minnesota. Right.
Green Bay, 12 and a half at...
You dumb fuck.
We told you this location's hot.
We told you to stay the fuck out of here.
Keough, nobody told me.
Honest.
Bullshit.
Come on.
Let's take a walk.
Hi, kid.
All right, a C-note apiece.
No way. We got a complaint.
Right, Frank? Come on.
All right.
Make it 200, Keough.
Hey, what, are you getting cheap in your old age, bambino?
- Three.
- Three?
You heard me.
- All right, three.
- I'll make it a light one.
- You wanna write this up?
- No, I'm gonna check in.
Take the collar, Frank.
Get on the sheet.
I better check in.
We're gonna have a little talk later, right?
That dumb schmuck only came up with two bills because I booked him?
Here you go, Frank.
It was your collar.
Keep it.
I had a hunch you weren't gonna take it.
You know, Frankie, we got a call about you from downtown.
Now, I ain't sayin' who.
They just said you couldn't be trusted, you know?
- Because I don't take money, right?
- Come on, Frank.
Let's face it. Who can trust a cop who don't take money?
I mean, you are pretty weird, you know, kid?
And with that call, the guys were gettin' a little worried.
I told them you were okay.
I knew you from the old 21.
You'd never hurt another cop, right?
You'd never hurt another cop, would you, Frank?
- That'd depend on what he did.
- That's the wrong answer, Frankie.
We're not doing anything bad here.
We're skimming a little gambling money.
It's clean. It's not dope.
It hurts nobody.
Come on, Frank.
Gamblers are gentlemen, and they're gonna operate anyhow, right?
Look, Keough, you don't have to explain yourself to me.
Do what you got to do.
Want some tea?
No, I don't like that shit.
I'll have a coffee, huh?
What's the matter, Frank?
What are you worried about?
Listen.
We don't go overboard here.
We're not sloppy.
We're careful.
The spicks, niggers, we bust them.
They operate so dumb and sloppy... they get your ass in hot water every time.
But the Italians, now, that's a different story.
They're men of their word.
They're reliable, Frankie.
- You really got it analyzed.
- Fuckin' right I got it analyzed.
It's worth it.
You know how much the nut's running now, Frankie?
- No, I wouldn't know that.
- $800 a month.
That's 800 clams every time your girlfriend gets the curse tax free.
Here's the beauty. You don't get it for the first eight weeks... till the guys get to know you and you're okay.
But you don't lose, either, 'cause you get it on the other end... when you leave the division.
Frankie, it's like... it's like severance pay.
Think it over, all right?
In or out.
Look at me. I'm shaking.
All my life I wanted to be a cop, you know?
It's like I can remember nothing else.
I remember this one time... there was...
Somethin' happened.
A domestic argument or somethin'.
Somebody stabbed somebody.
And... there was this crowd around this tenement.
I must have been nine, ten years old. I was this big.
I went over to see what was going on.
I noticed the red light goin' around and around... all these people, and I couldn't see.
I kept saying, "Do you know what's goin' on? Do you know?"
Nobody knew.
It was like a big mystery behind that... that crowd there.
All of a sudden... the crowd just parted... like the Red Sea, you see?
And there were these guys in blue, and I said...
"They know."
What do they know?
What do they know?
It's amazing.
It's incredible... but I feel like a criminal
'cause I don't take money.
You get so tense when you talk about it.
I wonder why.
Come here.
- Right there.
- Here?
I'm gonna ask you a question, okay?
Do you like cops?
You're my first.
No, I mean all this shit I've been telling you. Do you believe it?
Why not?
- Does it shock you?
- Not much.
What's the matter with me?
Everybody knows about cops.
Did you ever hear the story of the wise king?
Nope, but I got the feeling
I'm gonna hear it.
Well, there was this king, and he ruled over his kingdom.
Right in the middle of the kingdom there was a well.
That's where everybody drank.
One night, this witch came along... and she poisoned the well.
And the next day, everybody drank from it except the king... and they all went crazy.
They got together in the street and they said...
"We got to get rid of the king,
'cause the king is mad."
And then that night, he went down and he drank from the well.
And the next day all the people rejoiced... because their king had regained his reason.
I think you're trying to tell me somethin'.
- Me?
- Yeah.
Hey, Frank, I want you to say hello to somebody.
- Drop your cocks and grab your socks!
- What the fuck is this?
Frank Serpico, say hello to Don Rubello.
- He's gonna be your new partner.
- How you doin'?
If you don't want to work with this fucking nut for some reason, man...
I'll buddy up with him, all right?
And go through all that crap changing assignments?
No. We'll be okay.
We're paisans, huh?
- What's with the fucking mouse?
- It's my partner.
- Partner?
- He's specially trained, you know?
He goes to track down heroin.
Let him loose, goes into the hole, picks it up, brings it back... sniffs it out, brings it to you.
- Yeah. I heard of that.
- You heard of that?
This guy I'm looking for,
Vernon...
He's a numbers collector who ain't been meeting his obligations.
He won't be hard to spot.
He's a mover. This is prime time.
Since we're partners, you gotta know the situation.
Straight off.
I collect for the division... me and two other bagmen.
That's what Keough was sort of hinting at.
Three of us pick up the payoff twice a month.
Hey!
Look, there he is.
Son of a bitch!
- Look out!
- You stupid bastard!
Where's the money?
You been jerking me around, you fuck! Huh?
Ain't no money!
I'm behind now, man!
Three times you never show, right?
I'll have it for you tonight,
I swear.
Don't bust me!
Last time, Vernon.
The last time.
You fuck me and you're gone, you hear? You hear? Huh?
See you at the Domino, midnight.
And you'd better have $300, ya fuck.
You hear? Right? Right?
All right, Frank.
I keep this place for socializing.
Someday we'll get a couple of broads, huh? Have a little party.
Hey!
Make some ice.
Booze is right over here.
So what do you think, Frank?
About the money?
Look, Don... if I was broke, if I had a family...
I don't know.
But I'm not broke, and I don't have a family.
So why the fuck stick my neck out?
You know what I mean?
It's already out, Frank... not taking the money.
It's better the other guys don't know that.
Hey, I tell you what I'll do.
I'll hold your share for you, huh?
You change your mind, it'll be right in here.
Right in here, right down to the penny, huh?
Hey. Look at that.
- What are you drinking?
- Give me a scotch.
Next thing I wanna do, I wanna get a color TV for the games.
Hey, how about some gin?
Penny a point. Huh?
Yeah.
Let me ask him first.
Hello, Frank.
Get in.
My God, Frank.
This is confidential.
My God, Frank.
This is confidential.
He's a police officer.
I thought maybe he could sit in.
No, absolutely not.
All right, all right.
I notified Commissioner Delaney about everything you told me.
He wants you to stay where you are and continue to collect information.
Then you'll be his eyes and his ears.
He said he was delighted that, quote...
"A man of integrity had surfaced," unquote.
When do I hear from him?
He said he'd reach out for you when the time comes.
Reach out?
See, you know, my situation's pretty fuckin' sticky up there.
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Just wait for him...
- You must have patience, Frank.
- But it's pretty fucking sticky.
Patience and faith.
When a man like the commissioner says he'll get in touch with you... he'll get in touch with you.
Good-bye, son.
God bless you.
All right, now.
Marinda's too hot.
We got to lay off him for a couple of months.
And listen, Falco's got two runners he ain't paying for.
Check that fucking guy out, huh?
Hey, Frankie, how are you?
- How are you?
- Rubello's being transferred... so you're gonna have to work with a new bagman.
Al Sarno, I want you to meet Frank
Serpico. This'll be your new man.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Listen, you know that operation down by Hunt's Point, the new one?
What are we gonna do about that?
Who are we givin' to?
You the new bagman, you prick?
What happened to Rubello, you son of a bitch? You narco cop fucker!
Wait a minute.
You know, Frank, sometimes I ask myself... what the fuck am I doing?
You know, if this ever came out...
Christ, my family.
My daughter.
She just started with the San Francisco Opera.
Chorus.
Took a lot of money.
I once tried to pull out.
Christ, they were all over me.
So you... just go along.
Unless you're willing to go back to uniform duty.
Shit.
How the money rolls in.
- Here. Let me give you yours now.
- I'm not on.
- What do you mean, you're not on?
- Just what I said.
I'm not on.
I don't take money.
- Some gag. Here.
- No, I told you straight.
I don't take money, and that's the truth.
- What were you doing with Rubello?
- Ask Rubello.
Your nut... where's it been going?
Ask Rubello.
All right, then, sir.
I'll go to Delaney myself then.
- That would not be advisable.
- You don't understand, Captain.
- It's been weeks. Not a word.
- I understand perfectly.
No, but, Captain, now they know I'm not on.
I've done all I can do.
Good-bye, Frank.
He's out.
Won't do another fucking thing.
Blair, I'm telling you, nothing's gonna happen from the inside.
The top guys have been cops too long.
You haven't heard from
Commissioner Delaney, have you?
No, not a fucking word.
Would you be willing to go outside the department?
Where could we go?
Would you believe the mayor's office?
- The mayor's office?
- His right-hand man... guy named Jerry Berman, from Princeton.
You knew I knew somebody.
That's the somebody I know.
And he cares, Frank.
He really cares.
- You know what we're doing?
- Yeah.
- We're going outside the department.
- That's right.
Dynamite.
Every plainclothesman in the division... and one, maybe two lieutenants?
That is dynamite.
That is incredible.
That is 150...
That is $250,000 a year... but that is just one precinct.
Oh, that is amazing!
See, what I feel is needed here is, like, a real investigation.
And I am sure that the mayor will see this immediately.
McClain and Delaney... they have done nothing?
Oh, man.
That is amazing.
Another thing.
See, in a couple of days... they're gonna have a meeting of the pad.
Oh, right.
- Frank is in a very tough spot.
- I can see that.
Rumors. See, I have heard rumors, but never touching it directly.
And for an on-the-line cop to come forward like this is beautiful.
Really, Frank, I mean... you have my respect and my sympathy... for what you've been going through, man.
Wow.
Hello.
This is Jerry Berman.
Is he there?
All right. I'll hold on.
Well?
Tell me what happened,
Paco.
I'd like a drink.
That guy is gonna go to the mayor.
To the mayor!
Come here, Alfie. We're all gonna go to the mayor together.
You know that?
I couldn't be any more embarrassed.
It's like a personal defeat.
However... there are priorities.
What are the priorities,
Jerry?
The priorities are... a long, hot summer ahead... and riots are expected... and the mayor cannot alienate the police force.
Now, in the fall...
Now, in the fall, it may be possible... to take another look at the situation.
All right, fine.
I'm sorry.
They're all rotten.
Chickenshit.
The whole fucking system's corrupt.
- Who's there?
- It's me. I gotta talk to ya.
You know, Frank, you're behaving like a goddamn child. You hear?
Let him in.
You let him in.
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm sorry
I got you into the whole thing.
Bullshit! I got me into this whole thing.
"Wow. Amazing!
"Dynamite!
Beautiful! Dynamite!
Priorities. Priorities."
You and your big-deal friends, your contacts... your big bullshit names.
Bob Blair, the big operator from Princeton.
The mystery man with the connections, the hot line to the mayor.
Who the fuck do you think you are, you son of a bitch?
You come looking for help, whining, mealy-mouthed... with your humble-pie act... the saint, the injured innocent.
Who told you the department or the whole world... was some kind of a fucking boy scout camp?
What do you expect, for Christ's sake, a magician? A big daddy?
White knight snaps his fingers, the dirty world turns white...
Just keep talking.
That's what you can do. while the Pope's choir sings
"Ave Maria," is that it?
You gonna blame me 'cause those bastards don't wanna get involved?
I tried to help you.
I got my head handed to me.
Where's your head? It's on your shoulders. That's what I see.
- You don't look so hot yourself.
- What's all this shit over here?
Get ready to blow up again,
'cause I got another idea.
You and your ideas are as full of shit as you are.
- Right on cue.
- Right on cue.
We can talk to Foreman, the commissioner of investigations.
Another guy!
We got another guy here.
We could even talk to a guy
I know on the New York Times.
Oh, that's terrific.
Go to the Times.
Every time I talk to you, Blair,
20 more people know about it.
This is safe, Frank.
It's safe? With my ass on the line, it's safe, right?
- Your ass is already on the line!
- That's my business!
- You don't trust me, Frank?
- I don't trust you!
- Go fuck yourself!
- Fuck you!
Look, when I come home,
I want a house clean.
- Don't take it out on me, Paco.
- I don't want to pick up shit!
Honey... come to bed.
All right. Look, we all know what this is about, right?
Frank, what the hell was happening between you and Don Rubello?
Simple. I didn't take any money.
I don't take money.
Rubello said if I changed my mind, he'd hold my share... he'd give it back to me.
- I didn't change my mind.
- The conniving bastard.
- All right. I'll handle Rubello.
- Donny was stealing.
I'll get back the money he took.
But this ain't gonna happen again.
From now on, no more three bagmen.
Starting today, every one of you... makes his own collections... no stops, no bread, okay?
- Right.
- You got it.
What about you, Frankie?
I'll make up what Don took from you.
- Why should I start now?
- Everybody'd feel better about you.
You can always give it to charity.
Look, Frankie, what do you say, a hundred a month just for expenses?
For my secretary and my business lunches, entertainment?
All right. All right.
We split Frank's share from now on.
You're a schmuck, Frank.
If they would take all that energy, see... put it into straight police work... we'd have the city cleaned up in a week.
They'd clean up.
There'd be no crime.
If I could work alone...
That's the thing, see?
If I could just get... Work alone.
But they don't like that.
They don't want that.
They want to suck you in.
You go over the same thing, Paco.
So fucking corrupt. Everybody, everyone. Nobody giving a shit!
There's gotta be a way to wipe it out, goddamn it.
Let's get out of here for a while, huh, honey? Let's go to a movie.
Quit handling me! What are you doing? How am I gonna go to a movie?
They'd kill me if they knew!
You think that hasn't happened?
Either you're exploding, or you're lying around like a catatonic!
- I can't stand it, Paco.
- You don't give a shit, right?
All I care about is you!
That's all that matters to me.
That's why it hurts so much.
I can't stand to see you like this...
Scared, miserable, dreading to go to work.
It's tearing me apart!
And then I get sick of hearing about it, and I start hating myself.
You didn't like my being a cop, so don't give me that shit.
I love you! I want to marry you!
I want to have children with you!
- Goddamn it! I hate it!
- Why don't you get out?
- Why don't you?
- It's crossed my mind.
Well, do it.
- What do you got?
- Would you bust whitey?
Try me. Try me.
This guy's heavy.
He's Italian.
Mobbed up.
Still interested?
Stop fuckin' around.
I'm not in the mood. Come on.
He's a loan shark, runs a big numbers operation.
This mother's so cocksure... he picks up his own slips while he's collecting his loans.
Where's the drop?
Hold it!
I'm a police officer.
And...
Wait a minute.
You're under arrest.
- I thought you were a junkie.
- I'll take that wad in your pocket.
- You're a riot, kid.
- I know. I'm a joke.
What are you doin'?
What's that?
Put that away, or you're in more trouble. Give me your car keys.
Where they been hiding you, kid?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Hold this guy for booking.
Get a rap sheet on him.
I'm gonna search his car.
Where's Corsaro?
Smith took him upstairs.
I swear to God, I thought this guy was some fucking junkie.
Listen, Rudy, you should see some of the...
- Hey, you.
- Hey, who?
You. Get over here and empty your pockets.
- I don't do that.
- You're my prisoner. Do what I say.
- Get over here.
- He's gonna get nasty about it.
You're fucking right!
Hey, Frank, cool it, huh?
Lean, motherfuck!
Spread!
Frank. Hey, Frank, Rudy's on.
He's good people.
Stay the fuck outta this!
You fuck!
What's this?
What's this?
Get in! Get in!
Serpico.
Got that record check on Corsaro.
You want to read something?
It's about your pal Corsaro.
Here, read it.
Read it!
He did 15 years.
You know what for?
For killing a cop.
He's a fucking cop killer.
- It's good to see you again.
- I've had it. I'm finished.
- What's wrong?
- I can't take it. I gotta get out.
If I have to go back to uniform,
I'm going back to uniform.
I can't wait for Delaney to call.
I can't play their game anymore.
The commissioner didn't get in touch with you?
Not a word. No investigation, no undercover work, nothing!
- I had no idea, Frank.
- It's only fair to tell you.
I've been to outside agencies.
I'll go to more if I have to.
What outside agencies?
Holy Mother of God! Frank, we wash our own laundry around here!
- You could be brought up on charges!
- We do not wash our own laundry!
- It just gets dirtier!
- You are in trouble!
I don't care if I'm in trouble.
I don't care who gets it.
- If I have to go to outside agencies...
- Stay away from outside agencies!
- Where am I gonna go?
- You hear me?
- Where am I gonna go?
- Wait until you hear from me.
- I've been waiting for 11/2 years.
- I'll get back to you.
That's not enough!
Where am I gonna go?
It's my life, you fuck!
Serpico, see Inspector Palmer.
For this precinct, cases reported...
Murder... 14 for August,
20 for September, 23...
Inspector Palmer?
Deputy Chief Inspector Daley and Inspector Gilbert... are waiting to see you.
You want to come to my office?
Captain McClain called me.
I briefed Inspector Daley and Inspector Gilbert... on your allegations.
The question is, in all these months, why didn't you come to us?
Well...
I never met these gentlemen before, sir, and... you told...
I mean, you told Captain McClain... that the division was as clean as a hound's tooth.
You think you're the only honest cop on the force, Serpico?
My record's clear.
Inspector Gilbert's just come from the commissioner's... confidential investigation unit.
Then you must have heard something. I mean...
I don't understand.
Commissioner Delaney has known about this from the beginning.
No, I didn't hear a thing.
But I understand your frustration, Frank... believe me.
I mean, it's sort of like trying to punch your way... out of a paper bag, right?
What outside agencies have you been to, Frank?
I don't see how that's pertinent to my allegations.
We ought to ask Serpico directly if he's gonna cooperate or not.
- Come on.
- We've gotta know... if there's any real basis for an investigation.
Well, I...
I'll have to think that...
I'm gonna have to think about that.
What is there to think about?
I don't see how the division can investigate itself, sir.
You've got a point there.
But you would cooperate with an impartial investigation, right?
Yeah. Up to a point.
As long as I'm not involved.
I just want to go someplace where I can do my job.
That's fair enough.
We'll be in touch.
Inspector Palmer?
May I see you a minute?
Was it necessary to let everyone in the station house... know I was comin' in here to see these guys?
You believe from what you now know that a full-scale investigation... is warranted?
- Yes, Commissioner Delaney.
- Go to it.
But, sir... shouldn't headquarters handle something like this?
No.
You're all experienced men.
Chief Gallagher here will be available for consultation.
Commissioner...
Serpico claims that...
McClain talked to you about this whole thing some time ago.
Yes. I seem to remember something about that.
We can't set up a surveillance on
"somewhere over by Crotona Park."
We need a location!
I've given you 36 locations that are paying off.
Now, what do you want? The whole thing signed, sealed, delivered?
You're conducting this investigation, not me.
Lieutenant Smith...
Let's get back to him.
Lieutenant Smith.
Lieutenant Smith said to me... if I didn't want the money that he would stash it in his attic.
I'll have him transferred in the morning.
Fuck him.
How about transferring me?
I hear you been vouchering pad money... over to a confidential investigation squad.
Oh, yeah? How can I voucher money when I don't take any?
You won't find anything on Serpico.
He's clean.
Right?
You practicing your frisk?
I'm looking to buy a used tape recorder.
They're feeling me up every day.
How am I gonna wear a wire?
Come on, Frank.
Wearing a wire means testifying to corroborate the tape, right? Right.
I'm not testifying.
I gotta put a dime in the parking meter.
Ragland, put a dime in the parking meter for Serpico.
Hey, Frank. Frank, you know
Herman Tauber, district attorney?
Yeah, I watch television.
Frank, I want to compliment you for coming forward like this.
It's unique.
It's uniquely unique.
You should be proud of yourself.
There's gonna be a grand jury on these shitheels... with Frank Serpico as my star witness.
Mr. Tauber, you and everybody in this room can go to hell...
'cause I'm not testifying.
- Listen...
- Wait just a second, Frank.
You have nothing to fear.
You're not gonna be singled out.
I'm not afraid.
I don't give a fuck who knows...
- Wait a minute...
- if it meant something...
- but this investigation is bullshit.
- Mind if I say something?
Bullshit. You're not going after corruption in the department... the division, the Bronx.
A few flunky cops thrown to the wolves... to protect Delaney and those guys who've known about this for years... and won't do a fuckin' thing about it, that's why I won't testify.
- Hey, what's this?
- Exactly what it says.
I'm splitting.
"Splitting." I never read anything so stupid in my life.
"I'm leaving. If you want to discuss it, I'll be at Felix's."
I didn't feel like another blood-and-guts scene.
I figured you wouldn't be able to shout in here.
I can shout anywhere!
I won't shout.
Sit down, sit down.
It's just gonna go on and on, Paco.
It isn't gonna get any better.
And if you quit, somehow I'll be blamed.
How could you leave the man you love... future father of your kids?
You never said anything like that to me before.
And if I come back, you won't say it again.
You want to be free and unattached... to go on fighting for your cause and keep torturing yourself.
My cause.
I felt so safe with you... so loving.
Stay with me, Laurie.
- Come on. Stay with me.
- No, no.
- What do I owe you for that?
- Excuse me.
Here.
Here's $2.00.
What are you doing?
Do you want to walk away, or should I?
I'm not gonna walk away.
It's finished!
Who do you think you are, trying to pull that "no testifying" bullshit on me?
Chief Green,
I know your reputation.
Look, maybe if you were borough commander when this thing started... run this investigation yourself,
I'd feel different about testifying.
But the truth is, you're coming in after the fact.
You're like a quiff who says she won't, then maybe she will.
I'm like a quiff who's been fucked over... for a year and a half by guys like
Kellogg, McClain, Delaney...
I'm not Kellogg,
McClain or Delaney!
Frank, it won't be just flunky cops.
This is only the beginning.
This could be the biggest thing...
- since the Harry Gross case.
- And meanwhile, where am I?
I'm out there alone.
Who gives a fuck about that?
I'm totally isolated in the department. I don't have a friend.
Don't give me that bullshit. I've been puttin' cops away for 30 years!
My name's an obscenity on every precinct shithouse wall in the city.
- I've observed that, sir.
- Friends! I fought my way up... as a Jew in the department in the days you were supposed to have... an uncircumcised shamrock between your legs.
I have this nightmare
I'm on 5th Avenue... watching the St. Patrick's Day parade and I have a coronary... and 9,000 cops march happily over my body.
Friends. I haven't got a friend on the force, either, Serpico.
- I'll be your friend, Chief.
- I'm not lookin' for any.
- I'll make an exception for you.
- Frank, you're a good cop.
Stop being a prima donna.
Cut out the shticklech.
I don't understand.
How am I being a prima donna?
I want to protect myself.
We're gonna get the indictments.
You're gonna have to testify.
Ready on the right.
Ready on the left.
Ready on the firing line.
What are you gonna tell the grand jury, Frankie?
Depends on what they ask me.
Suppose they ask you who's taking money?
What I don't know,
I don't know.
But you do know, Frank.
Look, Frankie, I like you. I don't want to see anything happen to you.
But you gotta understand, a lot of people could get hurt here.
I'm not saying anything's going to happen. I'm saying it could happen.
I mean, there's lots of ways.
Nobody has to take a shot at you.
They can just not be there when you need them.
Somebody come at you with a gun, they look the other way.
Or they can send you in first enough times... until finally one day you're gonna walk in the wrong door.
- Thanks for the information.
- Fuck you, Frank!
I have nothing more. Does anyone have any further questions?
- Yes, Mrs. Crist?
- If I may, Mr. Knowles, thank you.
Officer Serpico came to the 7th Division... more than a year and a half ago.
All during that time, the things he's told us were taking place.
Now, why didn't
Officer Serpico... report these criminal activities when he first encountered them?
- I'd like to answer that.
- Mr. Chairman...
Mrs. Crist's question isn't material or relevant to the present inquiry.
- Although I want to make it clear...
- I'd like to answer that.
Officer Serpico cannot be considered derelict of his duty in any way... or guilty of any infraction of the law.
Quite the contrary.
The District Attorney is not prepared to say any more at this time.
Very well. Officer Serpico, thank you for your testimony.
This hearing is adjourned until 10:00 tomorrow morning.
Why didn't you tell him about Delaney and Kellogg?
Frank, this was a grand jury about police officers... actively engaged in corruption.
You don't implicate people without sufficient evidence.
That's crap and you know it, because even a dumb cop like me knows... a prosecutor can take a grand jury anywhere it wants to take it.
Now, you never led me anywhere near the real problems...
Nothing about the bosses, the brass... how corruption like this could exist without anybody knowing about it.
Now, a few flunky cops in the Bronx. That's it.
None of the shit in Queens,
Brooklyn, Manhattan?
While you're at it, why don't you mention Kansas City?
Well, "the biggest thing since
Harry Gross." That's what you said.
All right! Look, Frank.
You got guts, integrity.
There's going to be a detective's gold shield in this for you.
Now, that's terrific.
That's good.
Maybe this is what it's all about.
Maybe I should take my gold shield and forget it.
I know you've been through an ordeal, Frank.
I'm a marked man in this department.
For what?
- I've already arranged a transfer.
- To where? China?
That takes a 14-shot clip.
You expecting an army?
No, just a division.
Tauber, did you know I've had reports about Serpico being a fag?
He used to hang out in the BCI washroom.
That's stupid, Commissioner, and you know it.
Mr. Commissioner, a gold shield for Serpico at this time... would convince a lot of people...
Not while I'm commissioner.
Commander's office?
It's down that corridor.
Hey, Serpico. Do you know what they're saying in the Bronx?
That you spilled your guts to the grand jury.
Say it isn't so, Serpico.
It isn't so.
We know how to handle guys like you.
I ought to cut your tongue out.
Don't move.
Officer Serpico reporting for duty, sir.
I'm Inspector Lombardo.
I want to shake your hand, Frank.
It's gonna be nice to have a guy here I can trust.
Anybody in this command you want to work with?
It's not who I want to work with.
It's who wants to work with me.
All right. You can't find anybody you want to work with, Frank...
I'll work with you.
Is that all right?
How do we get past the lookouts?
How many you got?
One.
There's two.
There's two.
- Yeah, there's a guy.
- There's three of them.
It's four buildings away. We could try to get down the fire escape.
Get in behind him.
What do you think?
- Look good to you?
- Yeah, let's go.
What do you think?
Want to try it?
- Oh, boy.
- You all right?
Yeah. I feel just like a cop again.
- Let's go.
- Thank you.
Close up!
Wait, Frank!
Come on!
I ain't got nothing!
Beat it, fuck face!
Get the other one! Get out of here!
Get up against the wall.
What the hell's goin' on here?
Who the hell are you?
- Who are you?
- The police! Who the hell you think?
Get the fuck against the wall.
Up, up, up!
- Let me see your shield.
- All right. There's my shield.
- Where are you from?
- The borough. Manhattan 8th.
No, goddamn it! I just paid the borough this morning!
What the hell kind of shakedown is this?
Who'd you pay in the borough?
Nobody.
I didn't pay no...
Who'd you pay in the borough?
I didn't pay nobody.
Now let go of me.
We followed up, and there's no doubt about it.
The pad here in Manhattan is bigger... and it's more sophisticated than the one in the Bronx.
The pickups here are made...
You want to get this...
The pickups are made by... retired policemen.
That way, no plainclothesmen are directly involved.
Now, we need investigative help on this one, Chief.
If you need investigative help and you don't trust your own men... why don't you requisition some recruits from the police academy?
With all due respect, sir... backing us up is the only hope the police department has got.
Good cops would come forward if they thought there was encouragement... in the department to do so, and if they thought it would do any good.
If there's no encouragement, they're not gonna do it.
I've done a lot more than most people to defend and preserve... the image of this department and protect Commissioner Delaney... against reckless and irresponsible assaults from outside agencies.
That's it, huh?
I mean, that's what's really important, isn't it?
That's what you want to know... what outside agencies
I've been to, right?
- Hello.
- Hello, prick.
- Who is this?
- Frank.
- How are you? Where are you?
- I'm ready to go to the Times.
It's a goddamn serious step, Frank.
I don't know if the timing is right.
Look, I want it to get on the record, that's all... in case something should happen to me.
I want it on the record.
I don't know if we carry enough weight.
I don't know if the New York Times will go that far out on a limb... on the say-so of two flunky cops.
Suppose an inspector were to come with us?
You know, I got 20 years on the force.
Just bought this place.
I signed a 500-year mortgage on it.
- Turn that thing off out there!
- Come on. Everybody to bed.
- Aw, Mom!
- Turn that damn thing down!
Come on, now.
Go on upstairs.
You said we could go to bed late!
This is against department regulations, you both know that.
If they want to throw the book at me, they can do it.
If I left the force...
I don't know what I could do.
Okay, I made my little speech.
I'll back you up a hundred percent.
Times and the News.
I got the money, fellas.
Here you go, here you go, here you go.
Newsweek, please.
Holy sh... Jeez!
Aw, Christ!
You could almost predict the numbers they're gonna do.
Delaney's gonna issue some phony denial.
Somebody from the mayor's office will say something noble.
Delaney'll change his tune. Finally, the mayor will appoint a commission.
"Mayor Lindsay announced the formation of a five-man committee... to review the city procedures for investigating police corruption."
How come I'm not in the first paragraph?
Unbelievable!
The Times' report smells of the familiar smear tactics... of McCarthyism.
- I have issued a statement...
- We here at city hall...
The mayor appointed a special investigation commission...
to be headed by Whitman Knapp.
Yeah, come.
It's your reward. It's a transfer to narcotics, Brooklyn South.
You're still in clothes. You get a tin shield, not a gold one.
I miss you already, Frank.
Look, Frank... it's narcotics.
You be careful.
It's very easy to get hurt... and to... to be set up.
Get in.
You're not wired, are you?
Okay, you cocksucker.
You might get by in the Bronx with that kind of shit... but down here,
800 a month is chicken feed.
Last week, one dope dealer... sent out these guys making pickups.
40,000 each.
We let 'em collect it all, and then hit 'em.
120,000 split four ways.
That's serious money.
And with that, you don't fuck around.
- I got the message.
- Good.
Now get the fuck out.
The guy's name is Limbo.
He just uses this place, his girlfriend's brother's place.
He's a pusher... heroin.
- We'll drive around to the corner.
- Right.
You keep in sight out front. When you spot somebody who's dirty... take off your glasses and wipe 'em.
- Got it?
- Right. Okay.
We stay around here very long, we're gonna get spotted.
Well, Frank, why don't you go up there and check it out?
- Why don't you?
- I got the wrong clothes.
I'll take you shopping.
Limbo.
Police. Freeze!
Police officer.
All right, up against the wall.
Get your hands up against that wall.
Get up. All right.
- Palms on the wall and spread 'em.
- Get those hands up!
- Come on. Spread 'em!
- Get your feet apart.
- I saw the buy.
- Let's get Limbo. Julio!
- You all right, baby?
- Yeah, yeah. I got 'em.
Police officer!
What the fuck are you waiting for?
Go down the fire escape!
Police! Throw out your guns and come out with your hands up!
- Wait. What do you got here?
- It's Mr. and Mrs. Serpico, sir.
Okay. Go ahead.
- Where's our son?
- They're bringing him from X-ray.
- We want to see him.
- Just a few minutes.
Mr. and Mrs. Serpico... the news is better than we expected.
Thank God the bullet was a small caliber.
It didn't enter the brain... or strike the spinal cord.
He's on the critical list... but his condition seems to be stable.
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.
Stay out of there.
Didn't they tell you?
What?
The word is, don't talk to him.
He's no fuckin' good.
- How you doing, kid?
- Hello, Sid.
How are you?
You wanna read my fan mail?
Sure.
You're a big shot now, huh?
I want you to get those fucking cops away from my door.
The Knapp Commission likes you.
They want you to appear.
Naturally.
Heinemann and Julio are cleared.
The three of you are up for exceptional merit awards.
That's very funny.
That's very funny.
Francesco, you love me?
I always had a thing for you, Sid.
You know that.
Your gold shield's come through.
What's this for?
For being an honest cop?
Or for being stupid enough to get shot in the face?
You tell them they can shove it.
I don't want it.
Oh, well.
Well, Frank, the facts are these.
You'll have to stay on leave of absence for a few months.
In all probability, the hearing in your left ear won't come back.
Two bullet fragments are still lodged there in the bony portion.
One is very close to the carotid artery...
and you'll have to be checked from time to time.
Your left side will feel stiff occasionally.
Once in a great while you may experience some dizziness.
But in general, you'll be okay.
Through my appearance here today...
I hope that police officers in the future will not experience... the same frustration and anxiety that I was subjected to... for the past five years at the hands of my superiors... because of my attempt to report corruption.
I was made to feel that I had burdened them with an unwanted task.
The problem is that the atmosphere does not yet exist... in which an honest police officer can act... without fear of ridicule or reprisal from fellow officers.
Police corruption cannot exist unless it is at least tolerated... at higher levels in the department.
Therefore, the most important result that can come from these hearings... is a conviction by police officers that the department will change.
In order to ensure this... an independent, permanent investigative body... dealing with police corruption, like this commission, is essential.
After five dark, anxious years the sun breaks through.
The Dakota bringing home
Queen Wilhelmina...
...lands in a free country.
It is a stirring moment as the door opens.
Resolute and confident, the Queen sets foot on Dutch soil.
After a warm welcome by civilian and military a uthorities...
...Her Majesty leaves the airport.
A jubilant nation greets its So vereign Queen.
Her triumphant return to The Hague.
Highlight of these first weeks of liberation.
Without pomp, accompanied by a single aid...
...Her Majesty passes the cheering crowds.
Noordeinde Palace awaits her at the end of the route.
Once more flying the Dutch flag.
Children greet her with flowers.
As Queen Wilhelmina arrives at her palace...
...the realization that the House of Orange is home again...
...fills the hearts of the Dutch people with joy.

They have three weeks.
Enough time for a game of cards.

- Yes, sir.
Sing for us.
Hum along.
Off ke y!
And again.

Again.
Mr. President, this is a grave matter.
He's bleeding.
Hi, Eric.
Can you drink this yet?
Of course.
Hi, Esther.
I'll stay put if you don't mind.
Eight stitches.
- Unbelie vable.
- What happened?
It's a long story.
- We were...
- Not now, Eric.
- We're off to play tennis.
- No.
Tell us.
Well, it was the first e vening...
- Hello, ma'am.
- Good morning.
...puts it on my head and starts hitting it.
Wham, wham...
...and I kept singing.
Eric, you have a visitor.
The President.
Don't get up, Lanshof.
Your head after all.
Just a few stitches.
Telling your young friends about university life?
- Well...
- I'd like a chat with you, Lanshof.
Please sit down, sir.
You were off!
Are you coming?
My apologies for last night.
It was uncalled for.
It was nothing...
It was my fa ult. Is that beer?
Would you like some?
I intend to look after you.
There's a vacant room at my place. Want it?
Yes, thank you.
Your health, Lanshof.
Your health, sir.
- Call me Gus in the future.
- Right, sir.
Prick.
Thanks.
- Good, I'll copy them.
- You should attend lectures.
Mr. Particular.
You sound like my mother.
- I missed you today.
- I was bo xing.
- Eric's at home.
- I don't blame him.
Shall we go up for a drink?
Let's surprise him.
On my shoulders.
Nico? Or are you afraid?
No.
Come along with us.
How's the sherry?
Disgusting.
- I've got something stronger.
- Nice.
Give us a hand.
Ale x!
Pull!
- Gus might like a drink too.
- Call him, will you?
Gus!
Who's slinking about?
Professor Ten Brink.
I don't slink.
I was at Professor Teilders.
A prelim.
I passed!
A present...
...from my old man.
- That's a good one.
- A Leica.
German.
Ex cellent make.
- Want some?
- No, coffee. I'm in training.
I'll order some.
- One coffee!
- Hello, chaps.
- A drink?
- Please, one.
Take my chair.
- How's your lo ve life?
- I can't keep the landlady off me.
- Good looking?
- A figure...
One coffee.
For this gentleman, Greta.
We'll take a photo.
Mo ve closer together.
I'm going to Germany for a few weeks. Like to come?
No way. Trainloads of Jews arrive here e very day.
- I don't like swimming upstream.
- Cut it out, will you?
Don't mo ve.
Sit still. Watch the birdie.
It's coming!
As the nun said to the bishop.
Glass, glass!
Four, three...
...two, one...
Your health!
- Eric's good.
- You're better.
- Yes, at tennis.
- You should've played.
Guard duty.
Shut up!
Gus is a poor loser.
War!
- Jesus, war.
- Oh, the English...
We'll be neutral, as usual.
Don't be so damn stupid.
- What's with him?
- He's a Jew.
- I ne ver noticed.
- Prick.
- What was the score?
- Deuce.
Come on, Nico.
Turn off the radio, Robby.
Pencil!
Look, he can write.
May 9th...
What's the time?
- How's the army?
- A lot of wimps.
We could beat the Papuans.
Nothing will happen.
Do you mind?
Yes. A spot of war would be quite e x citing.
Gentlemen, it's time.
Robby!
We must be off.
Nico will take us to the station.
Mr. Particular.
Coming with us?
She wants to stay.
We'll get her home. Right, Eric?
- No problem.
- Well, Es?
I'd like to stay a while.
We'll show you out.
See you ne xt week.
Let's get going, Robby!
Off we go!
Bye, darling.
Why aren't you in the army?
Bad e yes. Everything's fuzzy at a distance.
But close up I see e verything, perfectly.
Robby and I are getting engaged ne xt year.
Congratulations.
- Lucky de vil.
- Who?
Both of you.
Want to dance?
Airplanes.
Are they ours?
We don't have that many.
Jerries.
Going to England.
Stop!
What do you want?
- We've come to volunteer.
- You must be mad!
- They're Jerries in disguise.
- We're Dutch.
Have them say 'sch'.
Germans can't pronounce it.
Sche veningen. Sche veningen!
Schele, schoonmoeder,
Sche veningen.
Let them through.
Eric, here.
We've come to volunteer.
Come back in ten days.
Officials!
We want to help.
Come back in ten days.
Ten days is quite reasonable.
- It'll be o ver by then!
- The last war lasted 4 years.
Come back in ten days.
Come on.
Come on, Eric.
- See you in ten days!
- Or sooner!
Been to a party, have you?
Yes, a party.
With schnapps and women?
Let's pay and go.
A tip e ven. Decent of them.
A fifteen minute rest!
Lieutenant.
- My folks live here, may I visit them?
- Go ahead.
Come in.
- You can shoot the lot of them.
- The damn traitors.
Dirty fascist.
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Son.
Bunch of idiots.
Just beca use your mother's German.
Stupid. Stupid!
They think they can defeat Germany.
They'll pay when we get out.
The lot of them.
And how.
- You don't have it so bad.
- We'll see.
Did you hear about the Queen?
She fled to England.
And you have to fight.
German paratroopers!
Behind those wooden shacks.
- What's up?
- Paratroopers.
Look, there.
Check it out.
Co ver us.
Wounded.
Jesus, what are you up to?
There's a war on.
So what?
April fool!
That's Dirk.
There's a madhouse nearby.
I fooled you! April fool!
Attention! Salute!
What's going on?
False alarm about paratroopers,
General.
The war is o ver.
Rotterdam's been flattened.
Thousands of casualties.
We've surrendered.
Surrendered...
- But it just started.
- It's o ver.
The politicians and collaborators betrayed us.
But it's not our fa ult.
Holland can be proud of its army.
Men, I thank you!
Now what?
Line up!
I n position.
Put it down.
I n the water.
Go!
Come back, that's dangerous.
Do you want some more sand?
- Jerry slut.
- Mommy's bo y.
You're attracting attention.
It's free.
There's Eric.
Outboard motor.
Gasoline.
Put some in.
- The forecast?
- Calm sea.
Good, or I'll puke my guts out.
Sure stinks.
Hope the Jerries don't smell it.
Screw it on tight.
Stand still.
He y, bastards!
Fine little boat.
Sherry from Pa, cheese from my mother for the trip.
- Got the charts?
- Couldn't get them.
You said you would.
There's only one England and it's there.
No, it's there.
Why aren't you coming?
Someone's got to do the dirty work here.
You're just afraid.
Let's leave it at that then.
Your health.
Celebrating something?
Ale x!
- How about a swim?
- Good idea.
Haven't seen much of you lately.
At home. My parents have had a tough time.
Who hasn't?
Call in some time.
Ale x, I like you, but visiting your parents is a bit much.
I'll see you around.
That's all we needed.
- The dirty fascist.
- Ale x is a fine fellow.
- I smell petrol.
- What time do we leave?
The beach will be deserted in an hour.
I n two days we'll be in London.
Knock on wood.
- It's a sturdy boat.
- One leak and you've had it.
What can go wrong?
The petrol!
Let's get out of here!
Hello, Robby.
How about that Robby?
Hangs the wash for his mother.
You'll ask the English to come and get me?
- Is that it?
- I n code.
- Really?
- Yes!
I can hardly signal:
'Will London come for Mr. Lanshof? '
Isn't it dangerous?
If I keep it brief...
...the Jerries can't locate it.
We hope.
- A potentiometer.
- Want to measure my potency?
Good morning.
I'll make contact.
- How do they know it's you?
- I use a code.
I always begin with L-O-V-E.
Lo ve.
Guess why.
Go!
She's on to something.
It stopped.
- Well?
- You can go.
- As a courier.
- Meaning?
Getting stuff from my group across.
That's fantastic.
When?
I'll let you know.
I magine, me helping you!
Not a big area.
Ne xt time he transmits...
...he hangs.
You seem to be very happy.
Did you tell Eric about our engagement?
That's why you're called LOVE.
- It's a tennis term.
- What are you talking about?
It's the best news
I've heard in years.
Let me know.
UNIVERSITY EX CLUDE S JEWS
Read Volk en Vaderland.
Volk en Vaderland!
He y, look...
UNIVERSITY EX CLUDE S JEWS
Read Volk en Vaderland!
- Here, we'll give you a hand.
- Thanks, I can manage.
We're here to help one another.
We've got nothing against Jews.
That's fine, thank you.
No, we're not finished.
Do you have accident insurance?
You shouldn't have got in our way.
Just an accident...
Send the bill to Hitler.
What are you staring at?
It was an accident.
Cheer up.
It could happen to anyone.
Get those things out of the water.
- I suppose you're a Jew too?
- Yes!
I'll kill you, you bastard.
I'll kill you.
Don't be so stupid!
I nside!
You'll get yourself in trouble.
- I won't let them do it.
- Go out the back way.
All the Jewish professors have to leave the university.
Yes, I heard.
First the professors, then the students.
All the Jews will be in the Polish salt mines soon.
Student bo xing champ and nowhere to go.
You can go to England instead of me.
How? When?
You'll hear from me.
Robby's e xpecting me.
What's John doing here?
He's taking my place.
What kind of madness is this?
Robby, the Jerries don't like Jews.
I could've sent Esther.
Yes, you could have.
Come on, we can't stay here.
There it is.
To the boat!
We'll meet again.
- I n London.
- Hurry up!
See that you get this to London.
Jerries!
Robby!
I'm stiff from the long trip.
The young one first.
Come along.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- I'm sure you'd like some coffee.
- Smells good.
Uncuff him.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Would you like a cup too?
You seem surprised.
We've pro vided for you.
Sugar?
Don't I get anything with it?
With your second cup.
Egyptian cigarettes...
...but quite good. Take one, please.
I suppose you were e xpecting
English ones this morning.
Mr. Weinberg, you realize...
...we want some information from you.
I know nothing.
I was going to England to fight.
The war is o ver.
- Not for me.
- Yes, it is.
People died today.
Remain silent and more will die.
I don't know any of them.
Too bad.
Then I'll see...
...if those papers are dry yet.
Up!
The English don't send planes for no reason.
Who or what did they come for?
I know nothing.
You know nothing, do you?
You're tough, aren't you?
Bo x er's muscles.
Turn him round.
Do you have muscles on your kidne ys?
Enough, Breitner!
We don't work like that.
Have you gone mad?
My dear bo y, I'm sorry.
Sit down.
Drink the rest of your coffee.
Drink.
Just tell me what you know.
Today's affair didn't happen by accident.
I wonder who let the cat out of the bag.
The information...
...could only have come from London.
Van der Zanden.
Do you know this person?
Van der Zanden...
He's our contact in London.
That's not true.
It's an open secret.
It's all for nothing, anyway.
I suggest you talk.
Talk!
That's your trick.
Butter up a person...
...and then beat him.
I know nothing.
Breitner will continue working on your case.
Speak up! Who was there?
Tell me their names!
I don't know, I don't know.
Sorry about that.
Tell me what happened.
We tried to get John o ver to England, by plane.
The big time.
- But it went wrong, totally.
- What a pity.
They got John.
LONDON BOMBI NG RE S UME S
If he talks, I'll hang.
Amateurs.
Smirking, well-fed prick.
I'll hang.
So you come to me?
Gus, I need a place to hide.
Catch.
Ke y...
...to my front door.
Stay as long as you like.
RUSSIAN FRONT COLLAPSE S
His lordship.
Prick.
You'll be safe at my place.
Hello.
Any around?
Up there.
It's teeming with them.
They're migrating.
A bea utiful sight.
I'll try to get a bit closer.
Bye.
Is that him?
- And he's not after the birds.
- Thanks.
My mone y.
You're a good patriot.
- Is that all?
- It's the rate.
Well, if it's the rate...
Two beers.
You look pleased with yourself.
Will you take these to Nico?
Sure.
Photos of German bunkers.
What are you up to?
Be more careful.
Scared? Your health.
Your health.
Let me go! Too late!
Take them away.
Let me go!
It's nothing to do with me.
- They must have followed me.
- Nonsense.
- Shit. Why me?
- Risky business.
I hope I don't talk.
- Try to escape.
- How?
No talking.
Stop!
'The traitor is Van der Zanden in London'
Come with me.
On toilet paper!
- You're Lanshof?
- Yes.
'Yes, sir.'
I'll be courteous when you are.
Did you write this?
Yes, sir.
What did you write it with?
With shit, sir.
You must be mad.
This is no way to apply for release.
Perhaps I didn't have a pencil.
Ne xt time I'll have you shot.
You may go.
Where?
Home.
- You can't just let him go.
- I'm not.
He'll be followed.
Bait? A lure.
Exactly.
He might try to get in touch with the resistance.
- Then you'll have new guests.
- We have the space.
Here, or in the dunes.
I'll leave it to you,
Obersturmfuhrer. Goodbye.
Hello. Come in.
Let me take your coat.
- It's a wonder you're home.
- That's for sure.
I stopped by a few times, but you were always out.
- I'm back now.
- Yes, so I see.
Sit down.
It's a bit of a mess.
I was working.
- Tea?
- No, I don't have much time.
No need.
Robby is back.
Has he been away?
You know quite well.
He told me about the plane.
We can stop pretending now.
Yes. Where is he?
I n The Hague.
He wants to talk to you.
Come here.
See that man?
He tails me where ver I go.
Security Police.
- Robby wants to see you.
- I mpossible.
They'd grab him too.
Ale x!
A friend of yours?
Yes, and so what?
Bloody bastards.
And they call themselves Dutchmen.
How have you been?
It was touch and go.
That vet had quite a go at me on the kitchen table.
Decent chap, though.
My transmitter is operating again.
Join us, Eric.
John is dead.
I've lost the taste for it.
You're scared.
We were betrayed by someone called Van der Zanden.
- How do you know?
- John told me.
And he's in London.
We have to pass that on, Eric.
Go ahead.
- You really disappoint me.
- Too bad.
- I'm being watched.
- Probably.
I'm a threat to e veryone.
We'll decide that.
I'll decide for myself.
Did you see Robby?
Then we can open the curtains again.
Fine.
That chap must be wondering...
Let him.
Ex citing?
It's a boy's book.
I'll be off then.
The curtains were a good idea.
The things you think of.
Here, your shoes.
Are you sure about this?
I want it to happen.
Sir...
Do you know where
Victoria Street is?
If you turn left there...
...you come to a square...
...then you turn right...
Come along.
Good day.
My compliments.
It wasn't easy to find you.
- What do you mean?
- Your transmitter.
It's on the garden shed there, isn't it?
- Do you smoke?
- No.
Do you mind if I do?
Thank you.
I have a proposition.
Would you work for us in the future?
No!
Look.
Your fiancé I belie ve?
I saw her at Lanshof's.
She looks Jewish.
Jewish. She'll go to a Polish labor camp.
Not so good for the health.
Many people die there.
Let's go.
Won't you reconsider working for us?
Graduated?
Yes.
Congratulations, Eric!
You're the first from our year.
- I thought it would be you.
- I can't get finished.
Better hurry.
The university is closing.
Damn Jerries.
I've heard some odd stories about you.
The resistance?
All o ver and done with.
I'm happy to hear it, Eric.
We must consider the future.
Let's go for a drink.
Degrees will count again after the war.
There's Robby's fiancé!
How nice.
I graduated!
Congratulations.
Flowers for you.
Come for a drink with us.
Wait for me.
There they are.
Two gins. One with lemon.
So, a lawyer...
What are your plans?
- Take a holiday.
- On the Riviera.
That's impossible with the war on.
Jack, you're so wonderfully naive.
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.
Nico.
They're after you.
You're telling me.
Still want to go to England?
Are you joking?
There's a Swiss ship sailing tomorrow. They'll take you.
Is it safe?
It's a chance.
Nice of you.
You're putting us in danger.
Here are your papers.
Your name's Jean de Kuyper.
Here.
Shake it.
We didn't rent this bathroom.
I'm disappearing for a bit.
We've got visitors.
- Your Gestapo.
- This might take a while.
Have another drink.
- Real Dutch gin.
- Prewar.
Lt. Thelen, Security Police.
Polzer, ship's captain.
Two gentlemen from the Greek na vy.
- A drink?
- No.
You've taken on a Dutch crew.
We'd like to investigate.
They're not here yet.
But you're sailing in half an hour.
That's right.
I n 28 minutes.
You can't sail until we've seen the entire crew.
That's for us to decide.
- Where are the y?
- One moment.
Come with me.
There.
Cordon it all off.
Man both ends of the gangway!
Nobody goes aboard!
Attention!
- This is an investigation.
- Jerries!
Stop! That will do.
Murderers!
A net, lads. Before he falls!
Hello, Captain. Hello, Mr. Snooper.
You're drunk. Blind drunk.
What did he say?
You're drunk!
Right! When do we sail, guv?
Nobody comes aboard!
What? Nobody?
Nobody!
We're not allowed on board!
Back to the pub!
Lower away!
Get away from my car!
Get out of it!
Filthy pigs!
That will do.
Have them come aboard at once.
No, I'm fully a uthorized to have them locked up.
They're ha ving a row.
The na vy will decide this,
Herr Lieutenant.
Let them board.
Come aboard!
Form two lines!
Music!
Attention!
Salute!
You're sober?
To the stokehold.
We must put to sea before the y change their minds.
Ready, sir.
Eric.
We're on our way.
Gus. Well, I'll be...
We're on our way!
- How did you get here?
- Nico. And you?
Me too.
Mr. Particular.
I ntermission
Seasick?
We're sailing due north.
Nico said it was heading for Russia.
We'll have tea with Stalin.
What's that?
A battleship.
- German?
- I can't bloody tell.
English!
Wait, I'm coming too!
Goodbye, Captain!
- Bloody awful here.
- It won't take long.
The only English I know is
'fuck you'.
Hi, lo ve.
- We're going to fly, with the RAF.
- Are you crazy?
- And you?
- The army. More peaceful.
If you get a nice uniform...
Mr. Lanshof?
Congratulations.
A daring bit of work, your escape.
Not really.
We could get a ship.
Not so modest.
You're one of 50...
...49 to make it o ver from
Holland alive.
Come straight to the Queen when you've finished here.
We cherish our freedom fighters.
I'll arrange the a udience.
Ask for General Van de Zanden.
You'd better give that to me.
Come along.
You've read too many thrillers.
I can manage from here on.
But you lack training.
Ne xt time better.
That would certainly please the Germans.
Eric! Come and join us.
- What's going on?
- We'll have a cup of tea...
...and then we'll have a chat.
Aren't you Mr. Lanshof?
You may take off your coat and sit down.
I'll take this.
No, that's where Her Majesty sits.
- Odd way to come in.
- He couldn't find the front door.
That's a nice uniform...
- I'm starving.
- Eat, Willem.
Ma'am, what do I call her?
You call her 'Your Majesty'.
- Is it 'Her' or 'Your'?
- 'Your'.
It's 'Your'.
- No smoking in her presence.
- I hear she's strict.
- Not o verly.
- There she is.
I bid you welcome.
You are my link with Holland.
Your Majesty, may I present:
Will Dostgaarde...
...Gus Le Jeune...
Your Majesty.
...and Eric Lanshof.
Mr. Lanshof.
Your Majesty.
Won't you sit down?
No, my guests first.
Do tell me, what is the situation at home?
Home? Which home?
Her Majesty means the situation in the Netherlands.
Not good. The Jerries are stripping us bare, Her Majesty.
- Those German bandits!
- I mean, Your Majesty.
But when the war is o ver...
...what must we do about the fascists?
Don't you worry about those shitheads.
Mr. Van der Zanden, what does that mean, shitheads?
It's a term, Your Majesty, e xpressing how we feel about traitors.
Right, Mr. Lanshof?
- Who said I was a traitor?
- John...
...shortly before he was killed.
And then they simply let you go?
I don't see the connection.
It's simple. The Germans wanted you to belie ve it...
...and then pass the word around.
What would they gain by that?
I am head of intelligence and I'm Her Majesty's secretary.
They would lo ve the Dutch people to think I was a traitor.
They did a good job trying.
- How's the army?
- The dregs!
- I've got something else for you.
- What?
A trip.
Where to?
To Holland.
No!
- How did you manage that?
- I didn't, she did.
I thought someone was lying in wait for me...
...with a gun.
Don't go totally bonkers.
- Still seeing her?
- None of your business.
Yes.
- Any progress?
- None of your business.
No.
Forget about her.
Shit, I want to sleep with her...
...while I still can.
Cold feet? For Holland?
None of your business.
We consider your presence in London to be of the utmost importance.
Yes?
Mr. Lanshof, come on through.
Do you smoke?
Thank you.
- And you perhaps?
- No, thank you. I don't smoke.
Let's go for a stroll,
I find that very enjo yable.
You're returning to Holland, aren't you?
Yes, Your Majesty.
I want you to bring se veral people back with you.
Isn't that dangerous?
Our future leaders are in Holland, in the resistance.
I want them to be here.
The y, at least, are of the people.
Gentility belongs to the past.
Things will be different after the war.
The true nobles are the resistance fighters.
Don't you agree?
Mr. Lanshof?
You're absolutely right, Your Majesty.
I hadn't looked at it that way.
True nobles...
Is there anything else, Your Majesty?
I wish you success.
Idiot, the Queen's got a front row view.
Here, put your mind to this instead of neuken.
Stop showing off, you'll be shitting your pants.
I'm not e ven wearing pants.
Here. A matchbo x to keep it in.
That stuff smells disgusting.
It's enough to make you puke.
...to make you puke.
We've stopped.
Come.
Throw some o ver me.
Your health.
Gus.
Be careful.
GERMANY WI NNI NG
ON ALL FRONTS
Filthy Jew
Good Morning.
I'd like birth announcement cards for my da ughter.
What's her name?
Wilhelmina Juliana Bernardina.
Come. They're waiting for you.
- Is this address safe?
- We'd not be here if it wasn't.
You're a Red, aren't you?
I remember seeing you in the House.
Hardly a pleasant e xperience.
Possibly.
I don't recognize you at all.
Gentlemen, please...
I can't be part of this.
I refuse.
You've pledged yourself to Her Majesty.
I promised the Germans
I would take no action.
General, the Queen has asked you to be her adviser...
...for the postwar democracy.
Wilhelmina and democracy, a belated vocation.
Or rather, she's always been a little touched.
Religion.
This is her chance...
...to play Christ, to save the world.
Count me out.
What an odious way of saying that you're scared.
If I were 20, I'd take e x ception to that. Gentlemen...
Perhaps you have doubts about the new democracy too?
New democracy?
We've ne ver had democracy.
When do we leave?
You'll hear from me.
Fine.
Could we get ca ught?
If they get me and not you, tell the Queen what the socialists want...
...after the war.
I'll warn them.
Goddamn it!
Waterproof.
Stone dead.
Nothing. How can
I tell London when we're coming?
They only confirm receipt.
I nstructions will come tomorrow.
- Anything else I can do for you?
- No, thank you.
I can do more than just transmit.
We'll phone if we need you, okay?
Fine.
See you tomorrow then.
Well?
I don't know their plans.
They're not talking.
Bad show.
They'd be on to me if I asked.
You're not trying hard enough.
Which of Esther's jackets would this go best with?
I'd lo ve to see you against the wall.
You'd be right ne xt to me.
Goddamn it!
Idiot!
A present for your fiancé.
Might be the last time.
Who's that jerk?
A friend from the resistance.
If that's one of your friends...
Darling, we can't always choose our friends.
This de vice uses zinc coins only
Damn it...
An odd uniform.
- U-boat, I think.
- Or a destro yer.
Stop.
Get off.
The German Army claims this bicycle.
Filthy, goddamn Jerry.
Right, beach huts at 11 pm.
You're going to England?
Police.
On your feet.
They're dead.
Damn. That was close.
We've got to get out of here.
To the car.
- What about me?
- You need a place to hide.
- Where?
- I'll fix it.
- Fix it? I just shot two Nazis!
- Scared?
Yes! Do I have to stay and wait for them?
Don't leave me here.
I want to go with you.
I object.
I decide who comes.
It's only my opinion.
He's coming!
I'll answer for him.
- He'll need tails.
- There are some in the garage.
Let it ring.
They're gone. After them.
If things go wrong, don't let them take me alive.
This'll do the trick.
Cyanide.
After them.
It worked.
No answer?
Where's Robby?
I don't know.
He comes and goes.
But you're engaged.
He's always busy with his transmitter.
A permanent place is too risky, he says.
Don't you wear a star?
Forged papers, from Robby.
And the liquor, the chocolate...
From Robby too?
A man from Robby's group brings it.
We can't e ven get those things in London.
Robby's in the resistance.
They can get anything.
Do you belie ve that?
I have to go to my parents' place and get my tails.
Are you going to a party?
Yes... you could call it that.
Lord, where are you going?
- The lion's den!
- Don't worry.
If anything goes wrong I'll shoot.
Robby, shut up.
Papers, please.
Thank you.
My compliments.
An e x cellent forgery.
They're the real thing.
Mr. Particular.
Phone headquarters.
We'll cordon off the area.
Ah, this messy tomato sa uce.
Have the cleaning bill sent to Berlin.
The Fuhrer will gladly pay.
You there, get out of the way.
We're going to party.
I'll join you.
Come on in. Nice and warm.
Oh, you're a hea vy one.
Everything is arranged.
We're here.
Stay with us.
Come on, let's go inside.
All right, I will.
It saddens me to see you among all these fascists...
...bunker-builders.
Oh, it's war.
And it's a nice party.
I heard you were abroad.
Bullshit.
I heard you were in London.
No, I'm right here.
As you can see.
It's a shame we're not fighting on the same side.
A shame.
A few years from now...
...the Germans and English will both be fighting the communists.
I doubt it.
We won't see it.
We won't make it through the war.
- I'll see if he's down there yet.
- All right.
To London, old spy.
Are you spying for the Germans in London?
Will you bring back some nylons for me?
What a lo vely brooch!
The I ron Cross!
- How'd you earn that?
- I blew up a Russian tank.
- Here, you earned it.
- Piss off.
Spying is a lot riskier...
It's mine.
Give it back, dammit!
- It's not a to y!
- I ron Cross, I ron Cross!
Gus!
It's running like clockwork.
No. We're in trouble.
What trouble?
We've been betrayed, by Robby.
No. He's with me.
- He's coming.
- Robby's working for them!
Jesus Christ.
- Where is he?
- Up there with the others.
Wait for me.
Filthy bastard!
Stay where you are!
Nobody mo ve!
- Run to the beach!
- You are surrounded!
If you mo ve, we'll shoot!
Stay where you are!
Don't mo ve!
We're opening fire!
Split up!
I deeply regret what has happened.
Mr. Van der Zanden?
Your Majesty?
We shall not repeat this.
Thank you very much for your efforts.
That'll ne ver get there.
So what?
Bread? Bread?
Hungry?
We're going.
We have to go. Bye.
'Lo ve from Ale x.' Your mascot.
He'll get a bomb on his head tonight.
I'm not that much of a bloody fool.
Shut up.
He's waking the dead in their graves.
Open up.
We won't hear from him again.
Nuremberg. These Jerries are good shots.
They're not drinking this Christmas.
- How much longer?
- 15 seconds. Cheers.
Bomb doors open?
- Bomb doors open.
- Christmas present ready?
- Count down.
Bombs away.
And back home.
Her Majesty wants you...
...as her aide.
Long live the Queen!
No, thank you, Captain.
This, I would prefer to do alone.
Couldn't you have accidentally dropped a bomb on that palace?
Well?
It's short.
It'll grow again.
A present from our liberated compatriots.
Understandable.
I've no hard feelings.
I survived.
- You did too.
- Yes, that's true.
Ex cept, you're a hero.
What will you do?
Work in the garden.
Clean up the mess.
Jack!
Good Lord, Eric!
Come in!
You look absolutely marvelous.
Medals!
How did you get them?
Did some flying, dropped some bombs.
We scraped through.
Don't ask me how.
Would you like a drink?
I have a nice wine for special occasions.
...universities closed. I took prelims behind closed doors.
Risky business.
You had to take care.
We'll simply start where we left off five years ago.
Here you are.
What are your plans?
I don't know.
To the future.
Your health.
Here comes the President's helicopter,
Marine helicopter number one...
landing in the Plaza on the east side of the east front of the Capitol.
Helicopter hovering gently, just off the ground.
Amazing timing. The President flying all the way across the world...
across the Atlantic Ocean...
arriving almost exactly as scheduled at 9:30...
in the Capitol Plaza...
so that he can go up the steps of the House of Representatives...
go into the chamber, and address the members of the House and the Senate...
the Supreme Court, the diplomatic corps of Washington...
all of whom are inside waiting for him...
in the chamber of the
House of Representatives.
Mr. Speaker...
the President of the United States.
And the President, accompanied by the Escort Committee...
comes down the central aisle, approaching the podium...
greets members of his Cabinet...
and those who are waiting to be confirmed as members of his Cabinet...
as he reaches the rostrum.
Shakes hands with the
Speaker, Carl Albert...
A happy President, smiling.
Ladies and gentlemen, President
Nixon will, in a moment...
address the Congress and the people of the United States.
Thank you.
Car 727. Car 727.
Open door at the
Watergate office building.
Possible burglary.
See the security guard.
Are you sure you want us?
517 is closer and they're in uniform.
They're getting gas. You take it.
Unit 1 to Unit 2.
Unit 1 to Unit 2.
- What?
- We're home.
Base 1 to Unit 1.
Base 1 to Unit 1.
We have some activity here.
Silence is advised.
Shut it off.
Base 1 to Unit 1.
Lights on the eighth floor.
Base 1 to Unit 1.
Is there anybody there?
There's people, people on the balcony. Armed people.
Base 1 to Unit 1.
Base 1 to Unit 1. We may have some problems.
Someone's here.
- Hold it, you...
- Police!
Put your hands up!
Drop that jacket!
Walkie-talkie, two 35mm cameras.
Got it. That's good.
All right, stay there.
I already got something for you. Did you see this?
A couple sleeping in bed, car hits the house... goes through the bedroom, comes out the other side.
Good morning. Crash.
Lewis is over at
Democratic headquarters.
One of the burglars had $814.
One $230, one $215, and one $234.
Most of it was in $100 bills and in sequence.
- Woodward?
- Yeah?
There's been a break-in at the Democratic headquarters.
- There's been an arrest.
- Local Democratic headquarters.
They were bugging the place.
Check the time of arraignment, and get over there.
And, Woodward, it was National
Democratic headquarters.
All right.
- Anything else?
- Anything else?
Break-in, car crash. That's not bad for a Saturday.
Okay, let me know what happens. Hello, Carl.
Got anything on that couple?
Harry, I know somebody on the staff over at Watergate.
Bernstein, why don't you finish one story before trying to get on another?
I finished it.
- The Virginia Legislature story?
- I finished it.
All right, give it to me.
I'm just polishing it.
I'll work the phones.
Polishing it? Yeah, you work the phones.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, who are the lawyers for the five men arrested at Watergate?
Do you know?
- Well, these two were assigned to it.
- I'm sorry?
These two were appointed to the case.
But only now it turns out the burglars have their own counsel.
- The burglars have their own counsel?
- That's right.
That's kind of unusual, wouldn't you say?
For burglars it's unusual.
- You know the name of the counsel? -
I don't know. Some country-club type.
You are charged with soliciting prostitution...
at 14th and east street.
And you get as your solicitor, one Perry Woodstock.
Your Honor, Mrs. Hawkin has in the past been a reliable, hardworking parent.
Parents are sworn over. I think
$300 would be acceptable...
Excuse me, what is your name?
I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
- Markham.
- Markham.
Mr. Markham, are you here in connection with the Watergate burglary?
I'm not here.
Okay.
Well, clearly, I am here... but only as an individual, not as the attorney of record.
Who is?
Mr. Starkey.
- Do you have any...
- Whatever you want... you'll have to get it from him. I have nothing more to say.
Starkey.
S-T-...
Mr. Starkey was very helpful.
Four Cuban Americans and another man, James W. McCord.
Look, I told you inside,
I have nothing more to say.
I understand that.
What I don't understand is how you got here.
I assure you there's nothing very mysterious involved.
Well, a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of the lawyers... assigned to represent the burglars.
So?
They never would have been assigned to represent the burglars... had anyone known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel.
Only, the burglars couldn't have arranged for their own counsel... since they never even made a phone call.
So, if no one asked you to be here, why are you here?
I don't want you to take this personally, Mr...
- Woodward.
- Woodward.
It'd be a mistake to do that.
I just don't have anything to say.
Did one of the other men involved in the break-in call you?
What reason do you have to assume that there were other people involved?
Well, one of your clients was arrested with a walkie-talkie.
They're not my clients.
Now, I don't want to talk about this anymore.
You're a lawyer and you're here.
One of the defendants, Mr. Barker, and I met at a social occasion once.
- Where?
- I have nothing else to say.
A Miami social occasion?
Mr. Starkey says the
Cubans were from Miami.
L-62, James McCord.
L-63, Bernard Barker.
L-64, Virgil Gonzales.
L-65, Eugenio Martinez.
L-66, Frank Sturgis.
Please step forward, Attorney Starkey.
All charged with Burglary 2.
- Mr. Starkey, will you represent all five?
- Yes, Your Honor.
And are all five gentlemen charged with burglary, second degree?
Yes, Your Honor.
Your names, please, and state your professions.
Bernard Barker, anti-communist.
Anti-communist? That, sir, is not your average profession.
James McCord, security consultant.
Where?
Government. Recently retired.
- Where in the government?
- Central Intelligence Agency.
Where?
The CIA.
Sturgis, Frank A., salvage operator.
Holy shit!
Eugenio Martinez, known as Gene Valdez.
James W. McCord, alias Edward Martin.
Frank Sturgis, alias Frank Fiorini.
All five of them had at least one alias.
Is there any proof they were trying to bug the National Democratic Chairman?
It's obvious they were trying to bug O'Brien.
They wouldn't go to all that trouble to bug secretaries.
- There's no proof.
- Wait a minute.
I called a lawyer in Miami I know.
He said four of the guys who were arrested were from Miami...
Gonzales, Martinez, Sturgis, and Barker.
Yeah, Barker. And all four of them were involved in CIA activities...
- No, they weren't.
- Yeah.
No, only one of them was admitted
CIA, and the CIA won't confirm that.
In fact, they deny even knowing McCord.
Yeah, but I just think it's obvious that with all that money and equipment... they weren't out to work by themselves. Somebody hired them.
I'm not interested in what you think is obvious.
I'm interested in what you know.
What we don't know is why they wanted to bug Democratic Headquarters.
Whether they were working for themselves... or other individuals or other organizations.
Could be a story, or could just be crazy Cubans.
Bachinski, when you get there tonight, take it easy.
The police are nervous.
Yeah?
Bachinski, calling from
Police Headquarters.
A friend just showed me what they found in the hotel rooms...
of the Watergate burglars.
There's something here you might want to look into.
Hang on. Okay, go ahead.
There's a strange entry in two of the burglars'address books.
- Yeah.
- One says, "H.H. At W.H."
The other says,
"Howard Hunt, W. House".
You can dial the White
House direct, can't you?
Yeah.
- What's the number? - 456-1414.
- White House.
- Howard Hunt, please.
Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.
He might be in Mr. Colson's office. I'll connect you.
Thank you.
- Charles Colson's office.
- Howard Hunt, please.
- Mr. Hunt isn't here just now.
- Do you know when he'll be back?
No, I don't.
Okay, thank you.
- Have you tried the Mullen Firm?
- I beg your pardon?
He also works as a writer at
Mullen & Company Public Relations.
Do you have a phone on that or an address, please?
No, I don't. I'm sorry.
All right, thank you.
Harry?
Who's Charles Colson?
Who's Charles Colson?
Sit down.
You know, I'm glad you asked me that question.
The reason I'm glad you asked me is because... if you had asked Simons or
Bradlee, they would've said:
"You know we're going to have to fire this schmuck at once because he's so dumb!"
Who is Charles Colson?
The most powerful man in the
United States is President Nixon.
You've heard of him?
Charles Colson is Special
Counsel to the President.
There's a cartoon on his wall.
Caption reads, "When you've got them by the balls...
"their hearts and minds will follow".
Mullen & Company.
- Howard Hunt, please.
- One moment, please.
Howard Hunt here.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
Yes, what is it?
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number... were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Good God!
Do you care to comment?
In view that the matter is under adjudication, I have no comment.
Hello?
This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
I was told that you had worked with a Mr. Howard Hunt.
Why would anyone say that?
You do know Mr. Hunt?
No, I don't believe so, and I can't imagine why anyone would say that.
Listen, I'm really sorry, but
I was on my way out. Goodbye.
Could we just confirm a couple... Bye.
- Did you say the Washington Post?
- Yes, that's right, the Post.
Your publishing firm was listed in some papers in connection with a Howard Hunt.
Yeah, he's one of our authors.
He wrote spy novels, I think.
What type of spy novels were they?
Were they modern, or were they period...
You say, "wrote"? You mean he's no longer with you anymore?
No, not at this time.
How long has it been since you've heard from him?
A couple of years, I think.
Could you tell me some of the names of the novels that he has written?
- Hello? Is this Mr. Paul Herrera?
- ¿Quién?
This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
Bob Woodward of the...
Do you speak English?
Momento, momento.
Do any of you guys speak English?
Do any of you guys speak Spanish?
- Señor.
- Sí.
Never mind. Thank you.
Thank you. Never mind.
- Hello.
- Mr. Bennett?
- Yes.
- This is Bob Woodward...
of the Washington Post.
Sorry to bother you at home.
I was wondering if you could confirm some information... on one of your employees,
Mr. Howard Hunt?
What kind of information?
It's just profile information mostly.
We know, for example, that he works for Mullen & Company... or did work for Mullen & Company as a writer. He's also a novelist.
We know that he works in the office of
Mr. Charles Colson at the White House.
And the CIA.
And the CIA.
If you're conducting that kind of investigation...
then certainly it comes as no surprise to you that Howard was with the CIA.
No, no surprise at all.
Hunt worked for the CIA till 1970.
From '49 to '70. Now, this is on deep background... but the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
What else you got?
According to White House personnel...
Hunt definitely worked there as a consultant for Colson.
That's Charles Colson, the
President's Special Counsel.
Did you call the White
House Press Office?
I went over there. I talked to them.
They said Hunt hadn't worked there for three months.
Then a PR guy said this weird thing to me.
He said, "I'm convinced that neither Mr. Colson...
"nor anyone at the White House...
"had any knowledge of or participation in...
"this deplorable incident at the
Democratic National Committee".
- Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
- Absolutely.
So?
I never asked about Watergate.
I simply asked what were Hunt's duties at the White House.
They volunteered he was innocent when nobody asked if he was guilty.
Be careful how you write it.
Looks like we've got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
Harry, this isn't a police story anymore. This is national.
We need a top political writer on it.
Well, they don't want it.
They're all over the goddamned map covering the Primaries.
Besides, this guy has busted his ass.
He's been on this paper for only nine months.
- What's the matter with you?
- He's a humper!
What's he been writing about, rat shit in restaurants?
- He's got no experience.
- He got a few of them closed, didn't he?
Minor incidents. Small government agencies.
Have Mr. Moffitt come in here, please. And see if Mr. Bradlee's free.
I want Ben to hear this.
Sure Moffitt'll want the story for the National desk... now that we've built it into something.
Even Bernstein's busting his ass!
I read that cockamamie memorandum he wrote on the break-in.
All right, so some of it was bullshit.
What is the matter with you?
You told me yourself you were going to fire him last month.
Look, he wants on the story bad. They both do!
He knows a lot of people.
Howard, they're hungry!
You remember when you were hungry?
Hello. Can you get me Nigel...
Right away.
- How's it going?
- What are you doing?
- Polishing it a little.
- What?
- Polishing it.
- What's wrong with it?
Nothing. Nothing. It's good.
Then what are you doing with it?
I'm just helping. It's a little fuzzy.
May I have it?
I don't think you're saying what you mean.
I know exactly what I mean.
Not here, I can't tell from this whether...
Hunt works for Colson or Colson works for Hunt.
- May I have it, please?
- Some of the conclusions...
- May I have it?
- Yes. I'm not looking for a fight.
I'm not looking for a fight, either.
I'm just aware of the fact that you've only been here nine months.
What's that got to do with anything?
I've been in the business since I'm 16.
What are you saying?
I'm trying to tell you that if you'd read mine and then read yours...
- May I read yours?
- Yeah.
I walked by, gave yours a glance, it didn't look right... so I just figured I'd refine it a little.
The first paragraph has to have more clarity... if the reader's going to understand it.
You don't mention Colson's name till the third paragraph.
I think mine's better. But you go ahead and read it.
If you think yours is better, we'll give yours to the desk.
I've got Colson's name up front.
He's a White House consultant and nobody knows it.
You're right.
Yours is better.
If you're going to do it, do it right. Here are my notes.
If you're going to hype it, hype it with the facts.
I don't mind what you did.
I mind the way you did it.
Woodward. Bernstein.
You're both on the story.
Now don't fuck it up.
Steuben, what's the name of that girl that you bombed out with...
- that works in Colson's office?
- Sharon Lyle.
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- You're attractive.
You are very attractive.
You know, my girlfriend told me to watch out for you.
- Who?
- I'm not giving any names.
Steuben said you worked for Colson.
Steuben's crazy. I never worked for Colson.
That's what he said.
I worked for an assistant. Colson was really big on secrets, anyway.
Even if I had worked for him, I wouldn't know anything!
Did you know Howard Hunt?
Didn't he work in the office?
Yeah, I knew Howard.
- Nice?
- He's a nice person.
He's secretive, he is secretive, but a decent man.
Do you have any idea what he did?
The White House said he was doing some investigative work.
What do you say?
- He was doing investigative work.
- On what?
- Different things.
- Like what?
She warned me.
I'm not going to take my book out. I'm just asking you.
The scuttlebutt for a while was that he was investigating Kennedy.
Go on.
The White House was real paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
I remember seeing a book about
Chappaquiddick on his desk.
And he was always getting material out of the White House Library... and the Library of Congress, and anything he could find.
White House Library.
Hi, this is Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post... and I was just wondering if you can remember... any books that a Howard Hunt checked out on Senator Kennedy?
- Howard Hunt?
- Yes, ma'am.
Yes, I think I do remember.
He took out a whole lot of material.
- Why don't you hold on and I'll see?
- I sure will. Thank you very much.
- Mr. Bernstein?
- Yes, ma'am?
- I was wrong.
- I beg your pardon?
The truth is, I don't have a card that says Mr. Hunt took any material.
I don't remember getting material for...
I do remember getting material for somebody, but it wasn't for Mr. Hunt.
All right.
The truth is, I didn't have any requests at all from Mr. Hunt.
The truth is, I don't know any Mr. Hunt.
I was just wondering if you have any books... Hello?
Yes, we're checking that information now.
We'd just like to find out just what it was that Hunt did... when he worked out as a White House consultant on the Pentagon Papers.
Yes, I'd appreciate that, if you could.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
I just got off the phone with the White House librarian.
You want to look at the notes on it?
This is some stuff from the
Eisenhower campaign in 1952... that Hunt was connected with.
Did you call the White
House Communications Office?
No, I just got off the phone with the librarian.
- 524-743. - I know the number.
Between the first and second quote there's a complete contradiction.
It's a space of about five seconds.
- My feeling is...
- Was this all...
Mr. Clawson's office.
This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
- Could I talk to Mr. Clawson, please?
- One moment, please.
Thank you.
When she came back she said she didn't even know...
- Ken Clawson.
- Mr. Clawson, this is Bob Woodward.
Carl Bernstein of the Washington
Post had a conversation... with a White House librarian... on some books a Mr. Howard Hunt took out on Senator Edward Kennedy.
She first said that Howard Hunt had taken out books on Senator Kennedy... and then she denied even knowing who he was.
I was wondering if you'd like to comment on this confusion.
Listen, let me call you back on this matter.
- I'm going to check on it for you.
- All right, thank you. Bye.
- Call back?
- Yes.
- This was all one conversation?
- Yeah.
She says first of all, "I think
I got a bunch of books on Hunt".
She comes back five seconds later, she says,
"I don't even know a Mr. Hunt".
It's obvious someone got to her.
Not enough proof. I mean, if there was just a piece of paper... that said that Hunt was taking out books on Kennedy and Chappaquiddick.
Like a... I don't know, library slip.
Hunt also took out books from the Library of Congress... but what's more important is that somebody got to her in that space of time.
- How do you know somebody got to her?
- Because she said that Hunt...
There was a lot of books that Hunt checked out.
And then she comes back and she don't even know him.
- Woodward.
- Mr. Woodward, Ken Clawson calling back.
- I've just talked with the librarian.
- Yes, sir.
She denies that the conversation with Mr. Bernstein ever took place.
She said she referred him to the Press Office.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, you say she denies even knowing... about the conversation taking place?
That's right. She said someone did call her asking about Mr. Hunt...
but all she did was refer him to the Press Office...
and she denies that...
- any other conversation took place.
- Total bullshit.
- I hope that's been of some help to you.
- Thank you.
- We've got to get something on paper.
- The Library of Congress.
Mona?
Excuse me, Mona, could you take any calls for me, please?
- Sure.
- Here's my note.
If I get any calls...
- Will you be back later?
- I don't know when.
You want all the material requested by the White House?
All White House transactions are confidential.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
- We need a sympathetic face.
- We're not going to find one here.
You want every request since when?
- When did he start?
- July of '71.
I imagine the whole last year.
I'm not sure you want them, but I've got them.
Maybe they pulled the cards.
Maybe they changed the names.
There might have been a card there, and we missed it.
Hey, wait a minute.
I met a White House aide once at a social occasion.
- So?
- He might confirm.
- Do we need W.H. In White House?
- Not in the second paragraph.
- I don't think we do. Do we?
- White House will be enough.
- White House.
- Just use White House. Forget the W.H.
I want to know about Colson. What was his job at the White House?
- Special consultant to the President.
- I gotta say it.
These notes on the White House librarian, are they accurate?
The White House librarian, the notes, are they accurate?
Yeah, but I wanna hear him say it.
- Okay, let's have it.
- Here you are, Ben.
It's a good, solid piece of American journalism...
that the New York Times doesn't have.
You haven't got it.
A librarian and a secretary saying Hunt looked at a book.
That's not good enough.
A White House aide told me that
Hunt was investigating Kennedy.
Who was it?
Who was it? You want the name, you mean?
No, how senior, how high up?
I don't know titles.
"Showed a special interest".
No, we said the White House was investigating Kennedy.
"Showed a special interest in him".
Jesus, the story's stronger than that.
The White House librarian says
Hunt checked out a lot of books.
We got a secretary in Colson's office said Hunt was sitting...
All right, Carl. Ben, that's a Page 1 story.
Stick it inside someplace.
This is a goddamn important story.
Get some harder information next time.
Asshole. Bradlee's just sticking up for the Kennedys.
- We didn't have it, that's all.
- Bullshit. We had it cold.
- No, we didn't.
- Why didn't you say something?
Do you think bitching about it is going to get the story where we want it?
Throw it in the can.
- Yes?
- This is Woodward.
I want to talk about
Watergate. I know...
We're not going to talk about that subject.
- We talked about Wallace.
- But this is different.
That was about the shooting of a man running for President.
- This is different.
- How?
Not about this story.
Don't call me again.
Good luck, Mr. President.
Taxi.
- Where are you?
- Stuck.
The story's stalled on us.
And you thought I'd help?
I'll never quote you.
I wouldn't quote you even as an anonymous source:
You'd be on deep background.
You can trust me. You know that.
Go on.
- Can you tell me what you know?
- You tell me what you know.
Hunt worked for Colson at the White House.
Hunt was investigating
Kennedy at Chappaquiddick.
That should tell you a lot.
What else?
We're beginning to hear a lot about a lawyer at CREEP named Gordon Liddy...
who's...
Gordon Liddy... was fired by Mitchell because he wouldn't talk to the FBI.
- You'll hear more.
- Will he talk?
I was at a party once, and...
Liddy put his hand over a candle, and he kept it there.
He kept it right in the flame until his flesh was burned.
Somebody said, "What's the trick?"
And Liddy said, "The trick is not minding".
The story is dry.
All we've got are pieces.
We can't seem to figure out what the puzzle is supposed to look like.
John Mitchell resigns as the head of CREEP... and says that he wants to spend more time with his family.
Sounds like bullshit. We don't exactly believe that.
No, but it's touching.
Forget the myths the media's created about the White House.
The truth is, these are not very bright guys... and things got out of hand.
Hunt's come in from the cold.
Supposedly, he's got a lawyer with $25,000 in a brown paper bag.
Follow the money.
What do you mean? Where?
I can't tell you that.
But you could tell me that.
No, I have to do this my way.
You tell me what you know and I'll confirm.
I'll keep you in the right direction if I can, but that's all.
Just follow the money.
- Goddamn New York Times.
- What is it?
Phone calls from burglars in
Miami to the Committee to Re-Elect.
Fifteen phone calls.
At least 15 phone calls and those phone calls were made as early as March 15... which is a full three months before the break-in.
"$89,000 issued in the name of a prominent Mexican lawyer".
$89,000 in Mexican checks?
Why didn't we get this?
Who are their sources?
I even know someone who works at the phone company.
Carl, if John Mitchell wanted your phone records... you'd be running around yelling invasion of privacy.
Was the New York Times article accurate?
- Yeah, but I can't get you a fuller listing.
- Why?
They've subpoenaed all of
Bernard Barker's phone records.
I think they're trying to find out if the
Watergate burglars broke any Florida law.
- Who subpoenaed them?
- Miami DA.
- What's his name?
- I don't know his name.
But, the guy who's heading the investigation is named Dardis.
Dardis. What's his first name?
I don't know his first name. I guess you'll have to find that out.
Hi. I'm Carl Bernstein, I have a
9:15 appointment with Mr. Dardis.
Yes, Mr. Bernstein, I'm afraid that Mr. Dardis... won't be able to see you this morning.
His calendar is really quite full.
There must be a mistake. I made the appointment with him personally.
- I called from Washington.
- It should've been made through me.
If you care to wait, I'll see if I can squeeze you in later.
Oh, thanks very much.
I guess it's difficult when he makes his own appointments.
Yes, well, we try to handle it.
It's 4:00, we'll be back in
15 minutes. You want anything?
- Coffee, black.
- Coffee, black.
I'm still here.
I'm so glad.
If you could just get me in to see him for five minutes, I'd appreciate it.
- No, Mr. Bernstein.
- I have to get back.
We're going to try.
Oh, hi. He's expecting you.
I do have a couple of things to do. I'll be at the Sheraton if you want to reach me.
If he has any space tomorrow, I'd appreciate it. Number's on the back.
- Fine.
- Thank you for your patience.
Thank you, Mr. Bernstein.
Tomorrow it should be better.
I guess so.
Mr. Dardis' office.
Hi. Please tell Mr. Dardis that
Mr. Bernstein has just left.
He'll be available all day tomorrow.
I think we can probably squeeze him in around 4:30.
Yes.
And please tell Mr. Dardis that he doesn't want to be late for his 6:30 appointment.
- Yes, I will.
- Thank you.
Mr. Dardis' office.
- This is Mr. Martinson over at the County...
- I beg your pardon?
Martinson, over at the
County Clerk's office.
There's some records here that Dardis wanted right away.
Could you come and get them? We're closing.
Well, yes, I'll be right over.
Could be easier, too.
All right. Hold it.
- What?
- Excuse me.
Hi. Can I help you in some way?
I'm Carl Bernstein. I've been waiting since 9:00.
- Would you wait outside?
- I've been waiting out since morning.
- Go ahead. Finish your call.
- Wait outside, please, will you?
No. I'm the reporter from the Washington Post.
We talked on the telephone yesterday... and you told me to come on down here and I'm here.
Okay, yeah. I've got the press here.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
If you didn't want to see me
I don't know why the hell... you didn't tell me when
I was in Washington?
I just wasted a whole goddamned day here. My paper's waiting for a story.
You tell me yesterday to come here.
You said I got a 9:30 appointment.
- I've been waiting out here the whole day.
- Caught me on the worst day possible.
The man I work for has just started a re-election campaign.
Now, we're gonna have to see each other tomorrow. Okay?
No, sir, I'm facing a deadline and my paper's saving a space for me.
- I just don't have a minute now.
- Well, I'm sorry...
Mr. Dardis, I'm really very sorry about this. Mr. Bernstein...
I beg your pardon, ma'am, but this gentleman... made the appointment with me specifically.
And I think the Washington Post deserves the same courtesy... as any of the people waiting out there, with all due respect.
I'll buzz you in about five minutes.
The lady takes good care of me.
The fact is we just can't go into it this evening.
It's going to have to wait till tomorrow. Okay?
I just wish you could've told me that before I left... because I gotta go back to my paper now and write that story... one way or another, that's all.
Do you want to see Mr. Barker's phone records and his money records?
You told me on the phone if I'd come here you'd show everything you got on Barker.
- That's all I want.
- Well, that's what I've got.
Well, that's fine.
Okay, you and I are going to have to have an agreement... that you're not going to reveal the source of your information.
All these are cashier's checks on a bank in Mexico City.
- All these checks from Mexico?
- Sí.
How come? Did the money originate there?
Well, I doubt it started off as pesos.
Wait a minute, what's this one?
What's... Okay, $25,000.
- Who's that?
- Kenneth H. Dahlberg.
We haven't been able to ascertain who that is.
Bob, listen, I think I got something. I don't know what it is.
But somewhere in this world there's a Kenneth H. Dahlberg.
And we've got to get to him before the New York Times does.
Because I think they have the same information.
Got a pencil? Write this down. Quick.
Kenneth H. Dahlberg.
D-A-H-L-B-E-R-G.
McGovern, who at first had voiced complete support for Eagleton...
has more recently expressed doubts...
and said that Eagleton must make a decision...
whether to stay or leave the ticket.
You're the one that wanted the articles...
- on Dahlberg, Kenneth H. Dahlberg?
- Yeah.
Couldn't find anything in the clip file at all.
Oh, wonderful.
I did find one picture though, if it's any help.
Thanks.
Minnesota.
Minneapolis...
I base that conclusion upon my conversations with his doctors...
and my close personal and political association...
- Outside line, please.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
...the joint decision...
that we have reached tonight, health would not affect.
But the public debate...
over Senator Eagleton's past medical history...
continues to divert attention from the great national issues...
that need to be discussed.
I have referred to the growing pressures that ask...
for Senator Eagleton's withdrawal.
Hello?
- Could I please... Mr. Dahlberg?
- Yes.
- Kenneth Dahlberg?
- Yes.
This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
- Yes?
- About that $25,000 check... deposited in the bank account of one of the Watergate burglars...
Mr. Bernard Barker...
As you know, sir, the check has your name on it.
We were doing a story on this... and I was wondering if you would care to comment or explain?
I turn all my money over to the Committee.
What committee is that, sir?
The Committee to Re-Elect?
- Yes.
- Why would you do that?
I raise a lot of money. I'm
Midwest Finance Chairman.
For the Committee to Re-Elect?
- Hello?
- Yes, that's right.
How do you think your check got into the bank account of the Watergate burglar?
I'm a proper citizen.
What I do is proper.
Oh, I understand.
I've just been through a terrible ordeal.
My neighbor's wife has been kidnapped.
How do you think your check got into Barker's account list?
- Committee to Re-Elect the President.
- Could I speak to Mr. Clark MacGregor?
- One moment, I'll connect you.
- Thank you.
Yes?
- Mr. MacGregor?
- Yes.
This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
- Hello?
- Yes.
This is Bob Woodward of the Washington Post.
I just spoke to a Mr.
Kenneth Dahlberg... who says that he is
Midwest Finance Chairman.
Yeah, I know Ken Dahlberg.
Well, I can't seem to get an explanation on why a check... for $25,000 made out to Mr. Dahlberg... that he apparently sent to the
Committee to Re-Elect the President... would end up in the bank account of a Watergate burglar.
I don't know.
- But you're head of the Committee, sir.
- Look, I just came aboard.
John Mitchell was the head of the Committee. He might know.
Well, what would the explanation possibly be...
I don't know.
You're implying that I should know...
and if you print that, our relationship will be terminated.
Sir, we don't have a relationship.
The issues of the campaign are peace and prosperity...
not a campaign check.
- Bob.
- Sir, no one is saying...
...this happened before I came on board.
- Mr. Dahlberg is on line 2.
I'm running a campaign for the re-election of the President.
We've raised $60 million and you're asking about a $25,000 check.
Mr. MacGregor, excuse me, could you hold one second, please?
- All right.
- Thank you. Yes?
- Hello.
- Mr. Dahlberg?
- Yes?
- Could you please hold one second, sir?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- Mr. MacGregor?
- Yeah?
Can I call you right back, sir? I'm very sorry.
- Yeah, okay.
- Mr. Dahlberg.
Yes. I'm sorry I hung up before.
I wasn't sure you were a
Washington Post reporter.
I believe we were talking about a $25,000 check.
Obviously this is difficult for me.
I'm caught in the middle of something and...
I don't know what.
What do you think it could be?
I deal with a lot of important people.
People who work for the Committee? Hello?
For the Committee.
- The Committee to Re-Elect the President? - Yes.
You see, I raised that money in cash...
and I have a winter home in Florida.
- Is that Miami?
- Boca Raton...
and I didn't want to carry all that cash around.
- Now, you can understand that.
- Of course I can.
So, I had it exchanged for the cashier's check.
And how do you think it got into Barker's account?
I know I shouldn't be telling you this...
I gave it to Mr. Stans.
I beg your pardon?
I gave it to Stans.
Maurice Stans?
- The head of finance for Nixon?
- Yes, in Washington.
Now what he did with it, I really do not know.
I see. Were there any other checks that you might be aware of, that could...
That's all I have to say.
Mr. MacGregor... Mr. Dahlberg...
I'm sorry. Thank you very much.
- Bob?
- Yeah.
- Carl Bernstein on line 1.
- One?
- Yeah?
- Woodward?
- Bernstein.
- I think I got a lead on Dahlberg.
- I just... I got it.
- What?
I just talked to him.
I just hung up from him.
Bernstein, listen, it goes all the way to Stans!
- What're you talking about?
- It goes all the way to Stans.
He gave the check to Stans for the Committee to Re-Elect!
- Did he say that?
- He said it. I've got it in my notes.
- Jesus.
- It's down on record, Bernstein.
That money winds up in the bank account of a Watergate burglar?
- Yes!
- Fantastic. I'm coming home.
Okay.
... catapulted the unknown Senator from
Missouri into national prominence...
by naming Eagleton as his running mate.
... bolstering of support for the Democratic ticket...
Scott, what happened with that Taiwan thing you were telling us about?
Japan is going to break diplomatic ties with Taiwan... when they recognize Red China.
The irony, of course, that's a direct result of Nixon's visit to China.
Jesus, what did he tell them? What did he say to them?
Incidentally, that's a great parallel story... if you're going to do that piece on détente.
Right, "Queen Elizabeth proclaims a state of emergency...
"to deal with what we call a 'dock strike' ".
Breaking it off...
I'll give you a human interest.
"Thirty-one days of rain in the Philippines...
"is being blamed on the theft of a statue of Jesus".
We had one like that before.
- I'll put my best writer on that.
- What about the one in India?
Laugh, gentlemen, it'll be the only story everyone reads.
Okay, National?
We have the Bremer diary.
"Wish to kill Nixon".
He took a car trip to New York,
Ottawa, and Washington to kill him.
We have the "Senate approving the ABM Treaty".
ABM.
Of course, we have "McGovern offering the VP spot..." to everybody.
- Yeah, that's news.
- I have...
Because everybody's been offered it.
Now, I'll tell you what will be news.
When somebody accepts it. That's news.
Here is some great art.
McGovern and Humphrey at breakfast, smiling their asses off.
Isn't that great?
- He says, "I am George's friend..."
- Why is that man smiling?
Sounds friendly. Very friendly.
"I'll be helping him in ways he never dreamed possible".
Breakfast followed by lunch.
Okay. Metro?
Well, we got the schoolteachers on Capitol Hill.
They want a 17% increase in pay or this fall they go on strike.
Harry, I think we could mention that this might be the time... to go to the front page on the district home rule.
- Oh, come on!
- Listen to him.
Ben, this time it could go all the way.
The House is going to vote next week on a Senate resolution.
Okay then, well, when they pass it, we'll run with it.
Okay, fellas, let's go around again now. Foreign?
Taiwan emergency, Philippines.
Okay, fine. National?
I'll stand on the
Eagleton follow-ups...
McGovern not being able to get a replacement.
He's offered it to Humphrey, Kennedy, and Ribicoff. All turned him down.
That's the Page 1 lead right there.
You're ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions.
Nobody cares about the
Dahlberg repercussions.
Now look, it was our story that got the General Accounting Office... to start an audit with CREEP Finance.
We printed that didn't we? When the frigging audit's done, we'll print that, too.
Let me tell you what happened today.
I was having lunch at the Sans Souci, and... this White House guy, a good one, a pro... came up and asked me, "What is this
Watergate compulsion with you guys?"
Compulsion? This is a story.
This is not compulsion.
I said, "Well, we think it's important".
And he said:
"If it's so goddamn important, who in the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?"
Now, what do you expect him to say from the White House?
"You're doing a great job"?
Why don't you ask him what he's really saying?
He wants to take the story away from Woodstein and...
- give it to his National desk.
- At least I have... some experienced guys sitting around who know the politicians...
- who have the contacts.
- We're aware of that.
You said it. Sitting around.
Ben, it's a dangerous story for this paper.
- What if your boys get it wrong?
- Then it's our ass, isn't it?
We all have to go out and work for a living.
National gets eight columns.
Nine for Foreign.
Metro, 15.
That's it, fellas.
Hey, Scott, I need to see you.
How dangerous?
Well, it's not just that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me... or that everything we print, the White House denies... or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
What then?
Look, there are over 2,000 reporters in this town... are there five on Watergate?
Where did the Washington Post suddenly get the monopoly on wisdom?
Why would the Republicans do it?
McGovern is self-destructing, just like
Humphrey, Muskie, the bunch of them.
I don't believe their story.
It doesn't make sense.
Yeah, Bernstein.
Now? All right.
Woodward, Bradlee will see us now.
Answer the phone for me, will you?
Are you trying to find the lowest possible common denominator...
Ben, it's the hottest item.
- It's in over 500 papers.
- What is it?
Yesterday's weather report for people who were drunk... and slept all day.
Jesus! Send it out...
to the San Francisco
Chronicle. They need it.
- How about the crossword puzzle?
- No.
Anagrams?
- No space, Mickey.
- Goodbye.
The last thing you bought from me was the obituaries.
- Make him buy something, will you?
- All right.
Hey, what do you guys want?
The GAO report's due out the morning of Nixon's renomination.
Sit down.
Well, that's two weeks from now.
Since they're only responsible to Congress... there's no way the White House can control the investigation.
There's a source over at General
Accounting that tells us... there's a whole rat's nest of illegal shit going on over at CREEP.
- Like what?
- Like a slush fund.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars of unaccounted-for cash.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars?
Any comment from CREEP?
Yes. Unavailable for comment. They're not talking.
But what else besides the money? Where's the goddamn story?
The money's the key to whatever this is.
- Says who?
- Deep Throat.
- Who?
- Oh, that's Woodward's garage freak... his source in the executive...
Garage freak? Jesus, what kind of a crazy, fucking story is this?
Who did you say?
He's on deep background.
I call him "Deep Throat".
Look, McGovern's dropped to nothing...
Nixon's guaranteed the renomination...
and the Post is stuck with a story no one else wants.
It'll sink the goddamn paper.
Everyone says, "Get off it, Ben".
And I come on very sage... and I say, "You'll see.
You wait till this bottoms out".
But the truth is, I can't figure out what we've got.
What else are you working on?
We're after a list of CREEP employees.
- Where is it?
- It's classified.
- How are you gonna get it?
- We haven't had any luck, yet.
Get some.
Anything else?
You made a mistake in there.
What?
You said to Brad that we haven't had any luck yet... and that's the thing that he jumps on. You can't talk about luck.
If you can't talk in specifics, you shouldn't say anything.
Is there any place you don't smoke?
- What?
- Hold it.
- What're you doing?
- Kay Eddy.
Doesn't she go with a guy that works for the Committee to Re-Elect?
- The E.R.
- All right.
- Eddy? Hey. Kay, can...
- Just a second.
- 757-6521. - Okay, I'll get back to you on this, thanks.
Don't you go with a guy that works for the Committee to Re-Elect?
- Not anymore.
- You did go with him, though.
I think you were engaged to him, weren't you?
- Yeah.
- You got out of it?
- So?
- You're looking better.
Look, we need a list of the people that work there.
Do you think that...
- I can't do that.
- Why not?
It's personal.
What do you mean? You said it was over.
You're asking me to use a guy I care about.
- No. We're not asking you to use him...
- Well, sure...
...just to help us. I mean, we'd do the same for you.
My only chance of getting that story is if I see him.
I don't want to see him again.
- Do you have to see him?
- Sure, I have to see him.
No. Do you have to see him that way?
Can't you just call him up on the telephone... and say you want to have a drink with him, just feel him out?
You say the relationship is over.
What the hell do you have to lose?
Forget it.
We don't want you to do anything that would embarrass you... or that you don't feel right about.
Forget it.
Don't let her just get off. I think she was going to say something.
You just overdramatized it, she was going to give us what we want.
It's over.
- What?
- It's over.
Is this the whole list?
Look what it says. "Personnel,
Committee to Re-Elect the President".
This is all in alphabetical order.
You can't tell who works for who.
Well, find out the department heads like Mitchell, Magruder, Stans.
Here. John Mitchell.
- What's the number?
All right. Find somebody who has a number close to it.
- They probably work for him.
- There's a 303.
Okay.
Okay, we have to find out how the money got from Maurice Stans to the burglars.
Somebody who worked in Finance.
All right. Here's the head of
Finance. Maurice Stans, 269.
If we can just get somebody who works under Stans.
- Sloan? You need him?
- He's the treasurer.
- What's the number?
- Hugh Sloan, 287.
Is there a secretary?
Wait a minute. Manley.
Here it is. Irene Manley?
1406 Lee Jackson Memorial Highway.
- Hi, I'm Bob Woodward.
- I'm Carl Bernstein.
We're from the Washington Post.
We'd like to know if we could speak to you for a few minutes.
We understand your daughter works for the Committee to Re-Elect.
- Wouldn't be anything embarrassing.
- Would you object to just...
- Yes?
- Hi.
Miss Milland? Betty Milland?
- I'm Bob Woodward.
- Carl Bernstein.
We're from the Washington Post.
I know you're trying to do your job. I mean...
You don't understand the pressure that we're under.
It'll just take a couple of seconds. If we can just come in for a couple of...
- No, I really don't...
- We don't want to come in.
We understand that there was some documents... that were shredded at the Committee.
Well, there...
There's often shredding.
We do that a lot.
- Were you there during the shredding?
- Yes, I was.
I see. Were there any department heads from... the Committee who were also present?
Yes. Mr. Mitchell came in one night.
John Mitchell? The Attorney General?
He was carrying a raincoat over his head.
I thought he was going to go...
Did he supervise the shredding?
Can I not answer any more questions? I'd just soon not...
Okay? Maybe I could call you?
- Are you being told not to talk?
- Will you call us?
I don't know.
I'll try.
What about all that shredding that took place after the break-in?
Need to know more about the papers that were in shredding.
I think you've some idea what's in the papers... when the former Attorney
General comes to the office... when it's taking place at the Committee to Re-Elect... and got a raincoat over his head. Why's he in a raincoat?
Could be raining is what could've happened.
Let me go through the story again.
You got a woman who's frightened at the door. Works for CREEP.
She said there's shredding taking place.
We don't know what's in the papers.
We know the former Attorney General comes in with an overcoat over his head.
It could be raining.
There's a lawyer present.
We don't know what he asked them. She wouldn't talk about it.
Now, will you please tell me where there's a story?
There's a story in the fact that the interview did not take place in her home... but in the office of the
Committee to Re-Elect.
How's there a story in that? It's not enough!
There's a story because there's a lawyer in the office.
- I mean, you're more resistant than she is.
- That's right.
- Why?
- Because there's not enough fact.
Well, let's just turn around and go back and question her again.
- This won't take long at all. We just want...
- Please go away, okay?
Will you please leave before they see you.
- Who did you mean by...
- Who do you mean, "they"?
Could you give us their names?
We haven't revealed the sources of people that have talked to us.
You know, I really can't talk about this because...
Would "they" be members of the Committee?
Someone got to that woman.
It's the key to the whole cover-up.
How can you write that there's a cover-up?
We don't know that there's a cover-up!
Well, then, I don't know what the hell you need.
So, you tell me what you need.
I need more fact for a story is what I need... and I think you should need the same thing.
Okay, if you get in the car... and there's music playing in the car, hypothetically.
There's music playing in the car for 10 minutes... and there's no commercial.
What can you deduce from that?
- Is it AM or FM?
- Come on, Bernstein!
Is it AM or FM?
A guy can come up to me on the street and he can ask me an address.
Now, is the man interrogating me, or is he lost?
What kind of a story do I write?
What kind of a deduction do I make from that?
Because you don't have a gut feeling that the woman is trying to help us?
No, I don't have enough gut feeling and I wish I did.
We're from the Washington Post...
Abbott, Addis, Agusto, Albus...
Is there something that strikes you as odd about this?
- What?
- It's almost like there's a pattern...
to the way they're not talking.
The way they say "no"all the time. I think it's odd.
- Mrs. Hambling?
- Yes.
Hi, we're from the Washington Post.
I'm Carl Bernstein, this is Bob Woodward.
A friend of the Committee said that we could contact you.
- Who was it?
- We can't reveal that.
You can talk to us. We don't reveal our sources.
You people...
You think you can come into my home, ask a few questions... have me destroy the reputations of men that I work for and respect?
Do you understand loyalty?
Have you ever heard of loyalty?
- Hi.
- Yes?
I'm Bob Woodward.
Carl Bernstein. We're from the Washington Post.
Yes.
I've read what you've written. I want to thank you.
I've been a Republican all my life, but this goes beyond party politics.
Would you mind if we asked you a few questions?
No. Come in. Would you like coffee?
Sure.
What they've done is a threat to the Constitution.
It goes against everything we stand for.
Could you be a little bit more specific than that?
I'm afraid your articles have just scratched the surface.
You don't mind if I just take a few notes, do you?
No.
How long have you worked at the Committee?
Committee?
Yes, the Committee to
Re-Elect the President.
Oh, I don't work at the Committee to Re-Elect the President.
I work at Garfinkel's, in the accounting department.
- Miss Abbott?
- Yes.
Judith Abbott?
Carolyn Abbott.
We're just doing something wrong.
- Never been there.
- No.
We're doing something wrong.
It's just not good enough.
How can you keep going at something past the point when you believe it?
We just have to start all over again.
Nasmith, Narrow, Ness...
Nickels, Nixon...
Ed Nixon.
Jolson, Jones...
Jordan, Jost.
If we could only get somebody that worked for Finance to talk.
I can't believe it.
- What about the bookkeeper?
- Which bookkeeper?
The bookkeeper that worked for both Slans and...
- Oh, you're all right.
- Sloan and Stans.
I've been there. I've called her twice. There's no answer.
I say we should start again.
Abbott, Addis, Agusto...
Albus, Aldus, Alexander...
Balowski, Clan, Donstille...
Boyle, Brenner, Bromley...
Jost, Nasmith...
Narrow, Ness, Nickels...
Martini, Sandstrom...
Skroes, Skully...
Skully. We've been there twice.
All right, Willcox, Windfall, Winter...
Two weeks work, half the names crossed off and what've you got?
People aren't talking, Harry.
And it's the way they're not talking that's unnatural.
Harry, we've been up all night. We went over all the quotes of the people.
- Slamming doors in our faces.
- It's like they're getting instructions.
Want to hear some real news?
That GAO report in which you placed so much faith... well, it's been postponed till after tonight's renomination.
- What do you mean?
- Hughes got a call from Stans in Florida.
Says he has new information, not to republish without it.
They're going to bury the report until after the renomination.
The Grand Jury indictment will be out soon and every indication says... the indictment will stop at the five burglars, Hunt and Liddy.
And that's the end of your story.
The vote of all the delegates has been recorded.
The vote for Richard Nixon...
is 1,347.
The vote for Paul McCloskey is one.
And therefore I declare the nominee of the Republican Party...
for President of the United States...
President Richard Nixon.
Four more years!
The President, and the future President of the United States of America!
Wonderful young faces I see out there.
Your enthusiasm, your idealism, your hard work.
This is your first vote, and years from now...
I just hope you can all look back...
and say it was one of your best votes. Thank you.
Hi, I'm Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post and...
I just want to ask you a couple of questions.
Well, you don't want me. You want my sister.
It's for you. It's Carl Bernstein.
Oh, my God. He's the guy from the Post. Get rid of him.
Could I just borrow one of your cigarettes there?
Sure.
You've really got to go.
Sure. Could I just get a match?
I can understand your being afraid.
There's a lot of people at the Committee just like you... who wanted to tell the truth but some people wouldn't listen.
Certain people have gone back to the prosecutors and the FBI... to give information which they were never asked.
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance... and we were just wondering if you were... promoted to work for Mr. Stans immediately after Mr. Sloan quit... or whether there was some time lapse?
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
Can I get you some coffee or something?
Yeah. Thanks very much.
Door sticks.
Could I just sit down for a second?
Sure, you can sit down, but I'm not going to tell you anything.
Okay.
I was just curious why you lied just then.
Have you been threatened if you tell the truth?
No.
Never in so many words.
- How do you like it?
- Just milk.
- Thanks.
- Okay, I'll just get that.
I saw in the wires that Mrs.
Stans was in the hospital.
Is she feeling better?
The GAO, the General
Accounting Report said that... there was $350,000 in the safe of the
Committee to Re-Elect the President.
Were you aware that it was that kind of funds from the very beginning?
A lot of people are watching me. They know I know a lot.
Was it all in $100 bills?
A lot of it was.
I thought it was an all-purpose, political fund... you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
$350,000 for dinners?
How was it paid out?
Not in one big chunk.
There was a list of 15 names and the amount of money... given to each person next to the name.
What happened to the list?
It was destroyed. It was the only record.
Don't pay attention to this. This is for my memory.
I have a very bad memory.
You won't be quoted by name.
In fact, we get confirmations before we print anything.
I can't be... positive that that money was used for the break-in, you understand?
Yes, I do.
- But, people sure are worried.
- Which people?
Think you could help me with the disbursement of money... in terms of the number of people that were involved? How many?
A group of them. About five.
I don't know their names.
Would Mr. Sloan know?
- Would he...
- I don't want to say anymore, okay?
I won't be much longer.
I wondered if you could just help me a little bit about... the money. We hear all kinds of figures.
- There's so much of it.
- How much is "so much"?
In one two-day period,
$6 million came in.
- Six!
- Six million, cash.
We didn't know where to put it all.
I thought it was all legal.
I mean, I guess I did until... after the break-in when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
- This is Mr. Liddy?
- It's all so rotten.
It's getting worse.
And the only one I care about is Hugh Sloan.
His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right.
So, he quit.
I was wondering... if Hugh Sloan was being set up now as a fall guy for John Mitchell.
What do you think?
If you guys could get John
Mitchell, that would be beautiful.
Coffee's cold.
Is there any evidence that... any of Mr. Mitchell's assistants... were part of this?
I had all the evidence. It was destroyed. I don't know who destroyed it.
- I think Gordon did a lot of shredding.
- Hard evidence?
Well, I can't say that it would positively prove that they planned the break-in... but it would come pretty close.
Can you tell me anything about who got the money?
We have... had some help on this from a couple of sources... and this is a way of confirming it.
I don't want you to feel that you're in a position... where you have to disclose names.
I can just ask you initials... and then that way you're not divulging any information.
We have some idea.
Would that be all right?
Was there an "M"?
Can you just nod either way?
Did it go that high up?
"L"?
I don't want to say any more, okay?
I'm sorry. You said "L"... or... I get confused.
Could we just go back for a second?
In one six-day period, over $6 million came in.
You wouldn't believe what was going on inside that woman.
The stuff was just ready to pour out.
I'm pouring down cups of coffee trying to get it out of her... before she throws me out of the house.
- Give me your notes so...
- These are the notes.
- These are the notes?
- I've got stuff on napkins, matchbooks...
I'm writing in the bathroom while she's getting coffee.
- I'm a walking litter basket!
- You're crazy.
You'd be crazy, too, if you were operating on 20 cups of coffee.
Could you give me something I can get down?
I got it. I got it all.
Okay. Write.
- Mitchell was in control.
- Wait a minute.
- There were men working under Mitchell...
- How many?
I don't know how many, but the men working under Mitchell... received the money from the slush fund.
Do we know how much money?
We're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars.
And these men are the key to what that money was used for.
Boy, that woman was paranoid.
At one point, I suddenly wondered how high up this thing goes... and her paranoia finally got to me.
I thought what we had was so hot, that any minute CBS or NBC... would come in through the windows and take the story away.
You're both paranoid.
She's afraid of John Mitchell, you're afraid of Walter Cronkite.
- Right.
- Can we go back to what she said?
Here. "L," "P," and "M."
- What do you mean?
- It's "L," "P," and "M".
- She'd only give initials.
- Initials?
The initials are the name of the men that worked under Mitchell. "L," "P," and "M."
You couldn't get the names?
If I could've gotten the names,
I would've gotten the names!
I'm with the woman, trying to get anything I can.
She said "L," "P," and "M," that's all she would give me... are the people who worked under Mitchell.
She said something about
Mitchell. She hates him.
She said, "John Mitchell...
"If you guys could get John Mitchell, that would be beautiful".
Wait a minute, what's this here?
What are you writing about Sloan?
"Sloan was the treasurer of the Committee to Re-Elect.
"His wife is pregnant and she made
Sloan quit because apparently...
"he no longer wanted to be a part of it".
We've got to go see Sloan.
Okay. Make a note of it. So, what have we got?
Where's that matchbook?
- Here.
- "L," "P," and "M."
Okay, "L," "P," and "M."
- "L" could be La Rue. It could be Liddy.
- "L" is Liddy.
- How do we know that?
- Because she said it.
Right here. She said, "At the time of the break-in...
"there was so much money floating around...
"that I know Gordon got part of it".
So I said, "You mean Gordon Liddy?"
She said, "Yes".
So, "L" is Liddy. Okay, that leaves "P" and "M."
"P" could be...
Parkinson. It could be
Porter. It could be...
Wait a minute! There was a guy once.
There was a guy we talked to last week.
Didn't he say that there was a Bart Porter... who at one time was a member of the Committee to Re-Elect?
Porter was called before the Grand Jury investigation.
So "P" is definitely Porter.
"P" could be Porter.
"P" is Porter, "L" is Liddy.
All that leaves is "M"!
"M" could be McCord? That's out.
It could be Mardian.
It could be...
- Magruder!
- I think it's Magruder.
- I think it's Magruder, too.
- Why do you think it's Magruder?
Because he was second in command under Mitchell.
Why do you think it's Magruder?
Because at one time he was a temporary head... of the Committee to
Re-Elect, before Mitchell.
I don't want a cookie.
We've got to get that bookkeeper to say it was Magruder.
Never get her to say anything about "M."
We have got to go back there and try to get her to say it.
If we could make names of the initials... then we'll know the people at
CREEP who paid off the burglars.
We'll at least know who got the money.
The indictments that came down from the Grand Jury today... stopped... with the five burglars, Hunt and Liddy.
Carl, we have got to go back there and get that bookkeeper... to say who the names are and not initials.
She ain't going to give it to you... because I was with the woman for six hours.
- We have to try.
- Then you'll have to trick her, threaten her.
- She's not going to do it.
- Wait a minute.
- You know what we could do?
- What?
- Listen, we go back there...
- Yeah.
...and you ask her who "P" is.
- Yeah.
And then I say, "No, don't worry about it...
"we know 'P' is Porter".
I just bury it.
Okay. Now, wait a minute.
I say to her, "Who is 'P'?"
- And then you say to me...
- I say, "No, we know 'P' is Porter".
- You mean, you try to fake her out?
- Right.
- And what if she denies it?
- We're screwed.
- So?
- But if she doesn't, we know we got it.
- We know "P" is Porter.
- Try it.
Hi.
They'll see you.
Not if you let us in, they won't.
And I'm Bob Woodward.
- They'll see your car.
- We parked around the corner.
You have answers for everything, don't you?
If we did, we wouldn't be here.
You wrote what I told you.
Oh, no. Not your name.
No one knows it was you.
Could you tell us who got the money?
And how much?
You mean like, "What did you do with the $25,000, lady?"
What?
Little jokes they're making down at Finance these days.
If people are to be convinced... that Stans and Sloan are innocent, then our reporting must be precise... and you can help us.
Who is "P"?
"P" we know, is Porter.
You said, "$25,000."
Is that how much Porter got?
Was it more?
Was it more than $50,000?
Was Magruder the only
"M" to receive money?
Who told you about Porter?
I'd like to move on now to the subject of the break-in at the Watergate...
and the controversies that keep coming up out of that.
It has recently, very recently been reported now, that...
some documents were torn up...
at the Committee to
Re-Elect the President.
Are you investigating the tearing up of those documents...
Well, I think that came out in a story in the Washington Post.
- Yes.
- I think the investigation...
that has just concluded itself...
has probably been one of the most intensive...
that the Department of Justice and the FBI has ever been involved in.
Some 1,500 persons were interviewed...
1,800 leads were followed,
333 agents were involved...
14,000 man-hours...
fifty-one of the 59 FBI field officers were involved.
And that, I think...
is a great credit to justice in this country.
Did you know that documents had been destroyed?
No, I did not.
All these neat little houses and all these nice little streets.
It's hard to believe that something's wrong in some of those little houses.
No, it isn't.
- Hello, I'm Carl Bernstein.
- Bob Woodward.
We'd just like to talk to Mr.
Sloan for a couple of minutes.
- He's resting right now.
- Are you Mrs. Sloan?
- You're the two from the Post, aren't you?
- Yes.
This is an honest house.
That's why we'd like to see your husband.
Faced with certain criminal charges that might be brought... against some people that are innocent, we just feel that...
It's really for his benefit.
No, it's not.
No, it's not.
Deborah, tell them to come in.
Thanks.
- Hi, Carl Bernstein.
- How do you do? Hugh Sloan.
- Bob Woodward.
- How are you doing?
I appreciate you giving us the time.
You know, the reason that we're here, basically... is that we've talked to certain people who... have indicated that the reason you left the Committee... was because you no longer want to be part of it.
Yeah, right. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation... why the money was handed to
Liddy and Mitchell's aides.
Try to understand this.
- I'm a Republican.
- I am, too.
Well, I believe in Richard Nixon.
I worked in the White House for four years and so did my wife.
What happened on June 17, I don't think the President knew anything about.
Is it possible that some of his people might have known?
I'm not sure about that.
Do you think the truth will ever come out at the trial?
- That's another thing I'm not sure about.
- Why?
Well, obviously, because certain people lied to the prosecutor.
No. We were never told flat out, "Don't talk!"
But the message was clear, though.
In other words, by their very silence, there was a cover-up.
Well, they didn't urge us to come forward and tell the truth.
"They," meaning the White House?
Well, the Committee's not an independent operation.
Everything's cleared with the White House.
And I don't think the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
That report on the cash... in the CREEP safe, that $350,000?
- No, more.
- Was that a correct figure?
No, it was closer to $1,000,000.
And, as treasurer, you could release those funds?
When so ordered.
We don't know the names of the people who could order you.
- We just know that there were four.
- No, there were five.
Mitchell, Stans,
Magruder, they're obvious.
- There had to be a White House overseer.
- Yeah, Colson.
No, Colson's too smart to get involved directly with anything like that.
It's Haldeman.
Right?
I won't talk about the other two.
They both worked at the White House?
One of them did, the other one's not in Washington. But that's all I'll say.
- Kalmbach.
- Nixon's personal lawyer.
- Right?
- Nixon's personal lawyer?
I can't say anything. I'm sorry.
- Well...
- When's the baby due?
Soon. Next month.
- Are you going to stay here?
- No, I don't think so.
Decided where you're gonna go?
I've been looking for a job in the private sector, but it's...
It's very hard. My name's been in the papers too much.
You know, one thing I'm just still not completely clear about?
When you handed out the money, how did that work, exactly?
Badly.
I think what Bob means is, that ordinarily, what was the procedure?
Routine. I'd call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department.
He'd say, "Go ahead, give out the money".
This was all done verbally?
Yes.
Okay, we know there were five men who controlled the slush fund.
Mitchell, Stans, and Magruder.
Yeah, those three we've got. And all three have been named by two sources.
What about the other two?
- Kalmbach.
- We're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
Maybe we better wait until we get all five, huh?
Certain on Mitchell?
We know that he approved payments to
Liddy while he was Attorney General.
- You've got more than one source?
- Yes, Harry.
- Who are they?
- Sloan.
Sloan and who else?
There's another guy at Justice who so far won't confirm... the names of the others who control the fund. We're working on it.
- What about Deep Throat?
- He's not a source on this.
- But do any of them have an axe?
- No.
Personal, political, sexual.
- Is there anything at all on Mitchell?
- No.
- Then can we use their names?
- No.
God damn it! When is somebody gonna go on the record in this story?
You guys are about to write a story that says the former Attorney General... the highest ranking law enforcement officer in this country is a crook!
Just be sure you're right.
- Essex House, may I help you?
- John Mitchell.
Yes?
Sir, this is Carl Bernstein of the Washington Post... and I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour.
Tomorrow we're running a story in the paper... and we just think that you should have a chance to comment on it.
What does it say?
"John N. Mitchell, while serving...
"as United States Attorney General...
"personally controlled a secret cash fund...
"that was used to gather information about the Democrats...
- "according to"...
- Jesus.
"...sources involved in the Watergate investigation".
- Jesus.
- "Beginning in the spring of 1971...
"almost a year before he left the Justice Department...
"to become President
Nixon's campaign manager...
"on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund".
All that crap. You're putting it in the paper?
- Well...
- It's all been denied.
You tell your publisher, tell Katie Graham...
she's going to get her tit caught in the big ringer if that's published.
Christ, that's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Sir, I was just wondering if
I could ask you some questions?
- What time is it?
- It's 11:30, sir.
11:30? Is it morning or night?
It's 11:30 at night, sir.
Sir, the Committee to Re-Elect has issued a statement to our story... but there are just a couple of questions...
Did the Committee tell you to go ahead and publish the story?
You fellows have got a great ballgame going.
As soon as you're done, we're going to do a story on all of you.
Sir, there's just a couple of questions...
Call my law office in the morning.
There's no question you properly identified yourself?
He said it right off the top.
Mitchell know he was talking to a reporter?
Yeah, but I think I woke him up.
- Get good notes?
- Verbatim.
He really said that about Mrs. Graham?
Well, I'd cut the words
"her tit" and print it.
Why?
This is a family newspaper.
You know, once when I was reporting...
Lyndon Johnson's top guy gave me the word.
They were looking for a successor for J. Edgar Hoover.
I wrote it and the day it appeared,
Johnson held a press conference... and appointed Hoover head of the FBI for life.
When he was done, he turned to his top guy... and the President said,
"Call Ben Bradlee and tell him, 'Fuck you' ".
Then everybody said, "You did it, Ben. You screwed up.
"You stuck us with Hoover forever".
I screwed up, but I wasn't wrong.
How much can you tell me about Deep Throat?
How much do you need to know?
Do you trust him?
Yeah.
I can't do the reporting for my reporters which means I have to trust them.
And I hate trusting anybody.
Run that, baby.
The Washington Post reported that while still in office as Attorney General...
John Mitchell had personally controlled a secret Republican fund.
Mitchell denied any such involvement and called the story ludicrous.
The new charge also brought a response from Vice President Agnew...
at his stop in Tampa.
I have full confidence in Mr. Mitchell...
and in the people in the
Republican organization.
And I think that that kind of unattributed report...
at a time like this is counterproductive.
We must bear in mind that those who published it...
have already shown their sympathy for the other ticket.
A band and some young cheerleaders...
All non-denial denials.
They doubt our ancestry, but they don't say the story isn't accurate.
I mean, did you understand one thing he was saying?
What I can't figure out is, what is a real denial?
Well, if they start calling us goddamn liars, we better start circling the wagons.
When do you think they'll start doing that?
When they get out of Tampa.
Joe, come on. What's going on with you guys at the FBI?
I've been trying to get to you for weeks.
Your secretary says you're not in.
Last night I called, you said you couldn't talk... and this morning, as soon as our
Mitchell story hits the stands... you call me and say you've got to see me right away. Why?
Look, you guys have been causing big trouble at the Bureau.
Why?
Our reports are showing up in your paper almost verbatim.
I mean, you've really been on the mark, except for Mitchell.
Now, we didn't have that...
- that he controlled the funds.
- Right.
Our agents have been busting ass... but we're gonna go back now and see if we've missed anything.
What I don't understand is all the people... who might know details of the bugging operation... the FBI hasn't even talked to.
And why have you conducted your interviews of CREEP personnel... at CREEP headquarters... instead of at their homes where they might feel freer to talk?
Joe, wait a minute.
Why have the interviews at
CREEP always been conducted... within the presence of the lawyer who works for CREEP?
Look, you know I can't answer for the whole Bureau.
- Oh, come on, I'm just...
- I do what I'm told.
I followed my orders. Period.
What orders?
Wait. Woodward!
Wait!
Bob!
Out of the blue. Out of the blue.
Okay, this morning I get a tip to call a guy by the name of Alex Shipley... who is now the Assistant
Attorney General of Tennessee.
Now, the guy told me, that called me, that said...
He said that Shipley was asked in the summer of 1971... by an old army buddy, a Donald Segretti... to join a group of other lawyers... for Nixon's campaign to sabotage the Democratic candidates.
Listen, make a left when you can. We'll go to my place.
Sabotage Democratic candidates?
That's right. Now, I was able to make a couple of calls today...
and I got Segretti's records for the year...
His travel records for the years 1971
Does the FBI know about...
- Did you say left or right?
- Left!
We're going to my place. We gotta go over the records.
- Does the FBI know about Segretti?
- The FBI interrogated Segretti... and found out he wasn't involved in the break-in so they dropped it.
They didn't follow through on it.
- Where is he?
- He's in California.
- Jesus, look at this.
- What?
Segretti crisscrossed the country at least a dozen times.
He only stayed in cities where there were Democratic primaries.
Well, if the break-in is just one incident in a campaign of sabotage... that began a whole year before Watergate... then for the first time, the break-in makes sense.
This isn't so crazy.
This thing didn't start with the bugging at the headquarters.
Segretti was doing this a year before the bugging.
And a year before, Nixon wasn't slaughtering Muskie.
He was running behind Muskie, before Muskie self-destructed.
If he self-destructed.
- Hi. Donald Segretti?
- That's right.
I'm Carl Bernstein from the Washington Post.
Hi.
What can I do for you?
Well, my paper just sent me out here to try to persuade you to go on the record.
Why me?
I guess because you were the head coordinator... of Nixon's sabotage campaign against the Democrats.
- Carl, you want some coffee?
- You read my mind.
Carl, tell me something.
What do you imagine the head coordinator does?
Well, I guess basically you're involved in recruiting other people like yourself... other lawyers.
- Lawyers?
- Like Alex Shipley.
I made it clear that I would not do anything violent or illegal.
What do you mean by illegal?
Watergate, I mean, that's... The whole bugging. That's horrendous!
And what kind of stuff do you guys do then?
Nickel-and-dime stuff.
Stuff. Stuff with a little wit attached to it.
You mean, when you sent out on Muskie's stationery that...
Senator Hubert Humphrey was going out with call girls?
Listen, if anything, it helped the man's image.
What was the one on Muskie's stationery that you sent out... that said that Scoop Jackson was having a bastard child?
So, sometimes it got up to a quarter. Off the record.
I think one of the most interesting ones was the Canuck letter.
What about it?
Come on. Where you claimed that
Muskie slurred the Canadians.
No, I didn't write that.
Do you know who did?
Carl, when you guys print it in the papers, then I'll know.
Smart guy, Donald.
You're no dummy.
I'm a lawyer, Carl.
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer... and I'll probably wind up going to jail and being disbarred... and I don't know what I did that was so goddamn awful.
I'll tell you something.
None of this was my idea.
I didn't go looking for the job.
Well, that's important.
Chapin came to you.
You know what?
It's funny, but I keep forgetting that you guys knew each other in college.
You were friends at SC, you and Chapin. Who else was there?
There was me...
Dwight...
Ziegler... all the USC mafia.
And that's when you got involved in meaningless student elections...
when you start to try to get your man in so you stuffed ballot boxes and...
What's that term you guys use for screwing up the opposition?
- Rat-fucking.
- That's right.
You were just doing the same kind of stuff... when you were out campaigning for President Nixon.
Let me tell you something, we did a lot of worse things in college.
Look, let me ask you something, Carl.
What would you have done if you were just getting out of the army... been away from the real world for four years... didn't know what kind of law you wanted to practice... and one day you get a call from an old friend... asking if you want to go to work for the President of the United States?
Chapin was the appointment secretary for Nixon when he called.
Yeah. Listen, if those sinister things really happened...
I don't think Dwight knew anything about them.
He just did what he was told.
Told by who?
What's the topic for tonight?
Rat-fucking.
In my day it was simply known as the double-cross.
In our present context... it means infiltration of the Democrats.
Segretti won't go on the record... but if he would, we know he would implicate Chapin.
And that would put you inside the White House.
Who?
Be specific.
How high up?
You'll have to find that out for yourself.
I don't like newspapers.
I don't care for inexactitude... and shallowness.
The CREEP slush fund that financed the rat-fucking... we've just about got that nailed down. I don't know how...
Did you change cabs?
Yeah.
Does the FBI know what we know?
Does Justice?
Why haven't they done anything?
If it didn't deal directly with the break-in, they didn't pursue.
Who told them not to?
Don't you understand what you're on to?
- Mitchell knew?
- Of course Mitchell knew.
Do you think something this size just happens?
Haldeman had to know, too.
You'll get nothing from me about Haldeman.
Segretti said that...
Don't concentrate on Segretti.
You'll miss the overall.
The letter that destroyed the Muskie candidacy... the Canuck letter, did that come from inside the White...
You're missing the overall.
But what overall?
They were frightened of Muskie, and look who got destroyed.
They wanted to run against McGovern.
Look who they're running against.
They bugged, they followed people... false press leaks, fake letters.
They canceled Democratic campaign rallies.
They investigated
Democratic private lives.
They planted spies, stole documents, and on and on.
Now, don't tell me you think this is all the work of little Don Segretti.
The FBI and Justice know this?
- Carl?
- Yeah.
Why don't you pick up your messages more often?
- Right. You got a cigarette?
- Yeah.
Who's Pete Teller?
I haven't the slightest idea, Carl. I have this whole place to take care of.
- Carl?
- Yeah, one second.
Tell him to leave his phone number next time, all right? Hi, Sally.
Listen, do you guys know about the Canuck letter?
Yep. I'm sorry, I'm late.
I just wanted to make sure you knew who wrote it.
What?
You mean the letter that sabotaged the Muskie candidacy?
All right, come here.
When did he tell you this?
Gotta tell Bob.
- Woodward.
- What?
One second. Very important... Come here.
Tell him what you told me.
Here, sit down.
Just exactly the way you said it to me, say it to him.
Ken Clawson told me he wrote the Canuck letter.
The letter that said Muskie was slurring the Canadians.
Clawson?
The Deputy Director of White House
Communications wrote the Canuck letter.
- When did he tell you this?
- When we were having drinks.
- Where were you?
- My apartment.
- When did you say he told you?
- Two weeks ago.
What else did he say?
He didn't say anything?
Come on, you're hedging.
You think he said it to impress you to get you to go to bed with him?
- Jesus.
- No, I want to hear her say it.
Do you think he said that to impress you, try to get you to go to bed with him?
Why did it take you two weeks to tell us this, Sally?
I guess I don't have the taste for the jugular you guys have.
You're claiming it was all a misunderstanding?
Absolutely. Sally's got it all wrong.
I never told her that
I wrote that letter.
We were just shooting the breeze about the election.
She's an awfully good reporter.
I don't remember her getting that much wrong before, do you?
Look, that's a real bullshit question, Woodward.
That is a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
Listen. One last thing.
Do you remember where this shooting the breeze took place?
What do you mean, where?
I mean, was it a restaurant, or her apartment, or a bar?
Now, look. I'd forgotten the entire incident...
but it most certainly wasn't in her apartment.
- Do you remember when it took place?
- I don't have time for this. I'm a busy man.
Did you get all that?
What did he say about meeting in a bar or restaurant?
He said he forgot the entire incident.
- That means he didn't deny it.
- That's a non-denial denial.
Wichita, Kansas?
Yeah, he said that's a bullshit question, Woodward...
I know what he said. But
I'm from Wheaton, Illinois.
Hey, Bob, Carl. He's on the phone.
- Who?
- Clawson.
Get over there on line 4 and transcribe this, will you? Four.
- Four?
- Okay. Yeah.
Yes, Ken.
Sally, for Christ's sakes, don't tell them I came to your place.
Why not? What's wrong with coming over for a drink?
You and me? In your apartment?
Well?
Jesus Christ, you just shot me down.
If that appears in the papers that
I'm over at your house, having...
- Do you know what that does?
- No, I don't see why.
You don't? You don't?
- There's nothing bad about it.
- Well, there sure is.
This is just incredible.
Well, I have a clear conscience.
Sally, I have a wife, and a family, and a dog, and a cat.
She said that he was in her house having drinks.
Now, look, I don't care where it happened. What happened is what counts.
When we asked him about it, he said he forgot the entire incident.
- Yeah?
- Ken Clawson on the line.
- Ken Clawson on the line.
- Jesus.
Ken. What's up, kid?
Ben, now, look, this whole thing that's going on over there, Ben...
I want you to know that I never claimed authorship of the Canuck letter!
Says he never wrote the letter.
It's some kind of misunderstanding, a confusion, I want you to know...
Slow down, Ken. You sound frazzled.
Now, Ben, please, listen.
If you're going to refer to that alleged conversation with Sally Aiken...
you can't print that it took place in her apartment.
I have a wife, and a family, and a dog, and a cat.
"A wife, and a family, and a dog, and a cat".
Right, Ken, right. Yeah.
Now, Ken, I don't want to print that you were in Sally's apartment.
Thank God.
I just want to know what you said in Sally's apartment.
- Hello.
- Bernstein...
I just got a tip from our FBI source.
The secret cash fund financed Segretti.
- Jesus.
- All right. Now, listen.
Chapin hired Segretti, we know that.
And we know Haldeman hired Chapin.
Haldeman has to be the fifth name to control the fund.
Sloan knows.
We've only got four out of the five who controlled the fund.
It has to be Haldeman.
I don't think we've got it.
We know the fifth is a top White House official.
But no one has said it.
No one has named Haldeman.
- No one's denied it.
- That still doesn't prove it was Haldeman.
If you go to bed at night and there's no snow on the ground... when you wake up and there's snow on the ground... you can say it snowed during the night, although you didn't see it.
But if we can't prove the fifth man is Haldeman, we're wiped out.
Everything in that campaign is done with his approval.
We know that everybody who works under Haldeman... does so with his knowledge.
And everybody is under
Haldeman, except the President.
Common sense says it's Haldeman.
If we go and see Sloan...
and we tell him that we know that he named Haldeman to the Grand Jury...
Then all we would need to do is have him confirm it.
Right.
- Want to do it that way?
- Yes.
Let's go back and see Sloan.
We can't go now 'cause he's not home yet.
He may not be answering, but he might be there.
- Hi.
- Please.
Listen, we've already written the story. We just need you to define...
Deborah's in the hospital and my in-laws are coming...
- Two questions?
- We understand.
Two questions?
The cash that financed the Watergate break-in... five men had control of the fund.
Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach.
We have confirmations on those four.
- We just found out Haldeman's the fifth.
- I'm not your source on that.
We're not asking you to be our source.
All we're asking is to confirm it.
I'm not your source on Haldeman.
Okay, look, when you were questioned by the Grand Jury...
You had to name names.
- Of course, everything they asked, yes.
- Lf they asked you. All right if they...
I don't know... Say we wrote a story that said that Haldeman... was the fifth name to control the fund.
- Would we be in any trouble?
- Would we be wrong?
Let me put it this way.
I would have no problems if you wrote a story like that.
- You wouldn't?
- No.
- That's okay. Yeah.
- Okay.
- Oh, you had a baby.
- Yes, my wife did.
- Little boy or girl?
- That's terrific.
It's a girl.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- We're sorry to bother you.
- Yeah.
- Will you give our best to her?
- I will.
Well, I think that, Woodward, and I am curious of the fact...
that the FBI, in its entire inquiry, never talked to the...
Or did any inquiries into the second most-powerful man to the President.
You don't seem to understand.
No, you get nothing about Haldeman out of me.
But we don't need to know anything, Joe.
Tomorrow we're going with a story on the FBI.
Now, what does that mean?
And we're going to establish in that story... that you guys just about blew the whole investigation.
Oh, no, we didn't miss so much.
You didn't know Haldeman had control of the slush fund?
Oh, yes, we did. It's all in our files.
- Not about Haldeman.
- Yeah, Haldeman. John Haldeman.
Look, now, look, I'm very busy.
I've got to go put the kids to bed.
That's the confirmation right there.
Wait a minute, wait a sec. Did he say John?
- He said Haldeman.
- He said John Haldeman.
What the hell difference does it make if he said Isaiah or David?
There's only one Haldeman.
Yeah, well, Isaiah or David aren't assistants to the President.
I don't know, it still feels thin.
Christ, I just wish we knew if we could print this.
Now wait a minute, we didn't make them do these things... but once they did, they're fair game!
Harry, let's go over your sources again. I want to hear it.
Sloan told the Grand Jury. He answered everything they asked him.
That means there's gotta be a record somewhere.
He told the Grand Jury, the FBI confirms. What more do you need?
I happen to love this country.
You know, we're not a bunch of zanies out to bring it down!
Harry, weren't you arguing the opposite way?
No, not at all.
All right, now hold it.
One thing has nothing to do with the other.
We're about to accuse Haldeman who only happens to be... the second-most-important man in this country... of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House.
It would be nice if we were right.
- Have you double-checked your sources? - Jesus.
- Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
- Absolutely!
- Woodward?
- I'm sure.
I'm not. It still seems thin.
Get another source.
How many fucking sources do they think we've got?
- Are you sure Deep Throat won't confirm?
- He won't confirm, I told you that.
What about the guy in Justice?
You can't call him. He's right next to the Grand Jury.
- We have no choice. It's trouble.
- It's 20 minutes to deadline.
I don't even know if I can get him on the phone.
- Dr. Kissinger's office.
- Deputy General's office, please.
Do you know when you expect him back?
No, sir. I believe he's left for the evening.
If you'd like to leave a message...
Oh, could you hold, please?
Hi, this is Carl. I'm sorry to disturb you now... but we're going with the story that Haldeman was the fifth man... in control of the fund and they're hassling us here.
We've got three confirmations. If you could help us, I'd appreciate it.
I won't say anything about Haldeman. Not ever.
I understand. We wouldn't want you to do that.
We know it's against the law for you to say anything.
If there's a way you could warn us to hold on the story, we'd appreciate it.
I'd really like to help you, but I can't.
Look, I'm going to count to 10, all right?
If there's any reason we should hold on the story... hang up the phone before I get to 10.
If the story's all right, you just be on the phone after I get to 10, all right?
- Hang up, right?
- That's right.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
We're straight. All right, I'm going to start counting, okay?
- We all right?
- Yeah.
Okay, I'm counting.
One, two... three, four, five... six, seven... eight, nine, ten.
You got it straight now? Everything okay?
Everything's fine.
Woodward!
We got it.
- He confirmed.
- What happened?
I said if I get up to 10 and you don't hang up, it's solid.
- Did he confirm it?
- Absolutely.
We've got to tell Bradlee!
Bernstein got another source.
The guy at Justice confirmed.
If there's any doubt, we can run it tomorrow.
You don't have to. The story's solid. We're sure of it.
I just got off the phone with him. It's gold.
Okay, we go with it.
Woodstein!
- You know what it's about?
- No.
Sloan, who resigned as campaign treasurer...
after the Watergate break-in...
showed up for a deposition in the common-cause suit on...
disclosure of campaign contributions, and denied naming Haldeman.
Mr. Sloan, would you care to comment on testimony before the Grand Jury?
I'd like my attorney to answer that question.
Gentlemen, the answer is an unequivocal "no".
Mr. Sloan did not implicate Mr.
Haldeman in that testimony at all.
It is in his testimony that
Mr. Sloan acknowledged...
- that it was an espionage fund?
- No, not at all.
Did he mention any use of funds for espionage activity?
None, whatsoever. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.
Sloan expanded his denial to include his statements to the FBI...
and to all federal authorities. A short time later at the White House...
News Secretary Ronald Ziegler delivered a strong attack...
on the Washington Post.
Why is the Post trying to do it? You have a man...
who is the editor of the Washington
Post by the name of Ben Bradlee.
I think anyone who would want to honestly assess...
what his political persuasions are, would...
I think come to the conclusion, quite quickly...
that he is not a supporter of President Nixon.
I respect the free press.
I don't respect the type of journalism...
the shabby journalism that is being practiced by the Washington Post.
All I know is that the story that ran this morning...
is incorrect and it's been so...
stated as being incorrect...
by not only me, but by the individual...
whose Grand Jury, secret
Grand Jury testimony...
they based their story on.
And that individual has denied that he ever so testified.
No sooner had Ziegler finished, than the President's campaign manager...
Clark MacGregor, met with reporters.
Using innuendo...
third-person hearsay...
unsubstantiated charges, anonymous sources...
and huge, scare headlines...
the Post has maliciously sought to give the appearance...
of a direct connection between the White House and the Watergate.
A charge which the Post knows...
and half a dozen investigations have found to be false.
The hallmark of the Post campaign is hypocrisy...
and its celebrated double standard is today visible for all to see.
I'm not talking to you about
Haldeman or anybody else.
- Then what went wrong?
- Nothing.
Just tell us what went wrong?
Didn't you say that the FBI had the information on Haldeman in the files?
- No.
- Because we have it in the notes... from the conversation we had on the telephone right here.
We have to go talk to your boss if you don't talk to us.
What the hell are you talking about? I'll deny everything.
We're not trying to get anybody into trouble.
We're just trying to find out if we made some errors.
If we made a mistake, then we'll come off the story.
Just tell us if we're wrong.
Tell us if we screwed up.
I'm not talking about it.
I am not talking to you about
Haldeman or anybody else.
In fact, I can't even be seen talking to either one of you bastards.
- What are you afraid of? Who got to you?
- Are we being set up?
- Are we, Joe? Tell us!
- Are we being set up?
- Just tell us, we won't print it.
- Fuck you.
And fuck you!
Honest to God, I just don't know.
- Oh, I see.
- It's in the notes!
Yeah, we had another call on a long list and I've got another call, I've gotta go.
- Did you mean Bob Haldeman?
- Yeah, Bob Haldeman.
Jesus, what was our mistake?
Maybe there was no mistake.
Then they're just setting us up.
Then the whole thing was a set-up?
And they just hung us.
More denunciations. You'll have to make a statement, Ben.
One senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
I knew we had enemies, but I didn't know we were this popular.
Wow, look at this.
My non-denial denial.
Fuck it, let's stand by the boys.
Okay. Foreign?
All right, here's our headline.
Radio Hanoi reports the United
States-North Vietnam agreement... for a settlement of the Vietnam War.
Woodward, what did you find out? What'd he say?
What time is it?
- You fell asleep?
- God damn it!
Over here.
You let Haldeman slip away.
Yes.
You've done worse than let Haldeman slip away.
You've got people feeling sorry for him. I didn't think that was possible.
In a conspiracy like this... you build from the outer edges and you go step by step.
If you shoot too high and miss, everybody feels more secure.
- You put the investigation back months.
- Yes, we know that.
And if we're wrong, we're resigning.
Were we wrong?
You'll have to find that out, won't you?
Listen, I'm tired of your chicken-shit games!
I don't want hints.
I need to know what you know.
It was a Haldeman operation.
The whole business was run by
Haldeman, the money, everything.
It won't be easy getting at him. He was insulated. You'll have to find out how.
Mitchell started doing covert stuff before anyone else.
The list is longer than anyone can imagine.
It involves the entire U.S.
Intelligence community...
FBI...
CIA, Justice. It's incredible.
The cover-up had little to do with Watergate.
It was mainly to protect the covert operations.
It leads everywhere.
Get out your notebook. There's more.
Your lives are in danger.
Hi, I finally got Sloan on the phone.
Why the hell didn't you tell me over the phone?
- Woodward says phones aren't safe.
- Can't trust them.
- Come on in.
- We can't come in, sir.
Woodward says there's electronic surveillance.
- Surveillance? Who's doing it?
- It's being done.
People's lives are in danger. Maybe even ours.
What happened to that
Justice source of yours?
I guess I made the instructions too complicated.
Because he thought I said "hang up" when I just said "hang on".
- Oh, Jesus!
- The story is right.
Haldeman was the fifth name to control that fund...
- and Sloan would've told the Grand Jury.
- Sloan wanted to tell the Jury.
- Why didn't he?
- Because nobody asked.
Nobody asked him.
The cover-up had little to do with the break-in.
It was to protect covert operations and the covert activities... involving the entire U.S.
Intelligence community.
Did Deep Throat say that people's lives are in danger?
Yes.
- What else did he say?
- He said everyone is involved.
You know the results of the latest Gallup Poll?
Half the country never even heard of the word "Watergate".
Nobody gives a shit.
You guys are probably pretty tired, right?
You should be. Go on home.
Get a nice hot bath, rest up 15 minutes... then get your asses back in gear.
We're under a lot of pressure, you know, and you put us there.
Nothing's riding on this except the
First Amendment of the Constitution... freedom of the press, and maybe the future of the country.
Not that any of that matters... but if you guys fuck up again, I'm going to get mad.
Goodnight.
And now, fellow Americans...
the Honorable Chief Justice will administer the oath of office...
to the President of the
United States of America.
Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. President, are you ready to take the constitutional oath?
If you will place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand...
and please repeat after me. "I,
Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear...
"I, Richard Nixon, do solemnly swear...
"...that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States...
"...that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States...
- "...and will, to the best of my ability...
- "...and will, to the best of my ability...
"...preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States...
"...preserve and protect and defend the Constitution of the United States...
- "...so help me, God".
- "...so help me, God".
Let's get back to the lunch.
Don't you think the most important part of a meal is the wine?
Everything must follow the wine.
And in this case,
I could favor a red Bordeaux.
A red Bordeaux at lunch?
Your late husband would never have approved.
William!
William, stay away from the edge!
The edge is no place to play!
Yes, ma'am.
What is it, William?
I don't know.
He's got a knife in his back.
William!
Run, William! William!
- Joseph, over there!
- Get down, Eden!
Damn.
Joseph!
Leave us alone. You hear?
Get back! Leave us alone!
Come, girl.
Come on.
I am the Raisuli.
Do not laugh at me again.
Secretary of state to the president.
I regret to inform you that I have received the following dispatch... from Samuel Gummere, United States general consul, Tangier, Morocco.
On October 15, Mrs. Eden Pedecaris and her children... were kidnapped from their residence in Tangier... after the brutal murder of her servants and a guest...
Sir Joshua Kenyon-Smith, a British subject.
The act of barbarous criminality appears perpetrated by Mulay El-Raisuli...
Sharif of the Rifian Berbers and the last of the Barbary pirates.
The British minister and myself concur there exists... alarming prospects of danger for all foreigners in Morocco.
Request warships.
Gentlemen, the presidency was never won by a vice president... filling out his fallen predecessor's term of office.
That may not be in this instance...
The only thing people will remember about McKinley... is he got himself shot.
Teddy's the most popular president since Washington.
Why drag in Washington?
You know it and I know it, but that damn cowboy doesn't know it.
What he wants is some issue to hang his campaign on... something to arouse the populace.
- A cavalry charge?
- So to speak.
Morocco?
You know as well as I do we can't have Arab desperadoes... running around kidnapping
American citizens.
If I had my way,
I'd go in with Winchesters... a battalion of Marines...
- I can't do that. Can I?
- No.
- Has this Raspuli?
- Raisuli.
Raspuli, Raisuli, whatever.
- Has he made any terms?
- No.
- Good, that gives us an excuse.
- He will, though.
What makes you so sure?
He kidnapped a British consul once... but they became friends, and he sent him back. Spat on the blood money.
Yes. There's been others, though,
Spanish and French emissaries.
Send them back too?
- Parts of them.
- Parts of them?
Obviously, he has no respect for human life.
Threatening the lives and property of American citizens... it's an insult in the eyes of the world community.
Arabian thief holding me up like a common desperado.
Theodore, you're on to something.
I don't quite know what.
- What is it that you want, Theodore?
- What do I want? I want respect!
That's what. Respect for human life and American property.
And I'll send the Atlantic squadron to Morocco to get respect.
That's illegal.
Why spoil the beauty of a thing with legality?
The fleet sails tomorrow.
America wants Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!
Very good.
Pedecaris alive... or Raisuli dead.
Bull's-eye!
Don't touch me with that thing again!
I'm quite capable of understanding your gibberish!
Jennifer.
- William? William!
- Your hand, lady.
Oh, get away from me, for God's sake, you...
Get on those horses, Jennifer.
Let go of this!
Now I don't know who you are or what you want with us... but I will tell you that I am no coward.
And if you or any of these men should dare to lay a hand on me...
I will try with all the strength in me to kill you... and with my last breath,
I shall curse you to God!
God will listen!
- Do you play checkers?
- No, I play chess.
Better.
This is the RIF.
I am Mulay Achmed Mohammed
El-Raisuli the Magnificent...
Sheriff of the Rifian Berbers.
I am the true defender of the faithful... the blood of the prophet runs in me... and I am but a servant of his will.
You have nothing to say?
It has never been my intention to encourage braggarts.
Your shell is strong like a turtle's... but it is brittle.
Your tongue is clever and fast.
Be careful you do not trip over it.
You are a great deal of trouble.
Now see here, Abal, I don't intend to waste any more time watching you eat.
This is an effrontery.
Have you ever heard of the big stick, Bashaw?
Do not threaten me, Mr. Gummere.
I have been threatened by the French...
Germans and the English.
I've been threatened by experts,
Mr. Gummere.
And yet Morocco is still the only sovereign Moslem throne... west of Constantinople.
- Yes, but it is shaky.
Yes, we have French infantry and German cavalry.
Our currency is Spanish, but my nephew is the sultan of Morocco.
And it is as it shall be.
Well, if you wish it to stay that way... then I implore you to send your French infantry... and your German cavalry into the RIF and bring our people back.
Better to serve the leopards than the fox.
I am only a servant of the sultan, the chosen one, the defender of the faithful.
I can make no such decision.
Very well then, we shall seek an audience with the sultan himself.
He will not see you... unless it pleases him.
Now listen here, we represent a modern power!
We're talking about Marines, battleships, big guns.
- We are not fooling about.
- Richard.
We are not here to make threats... merely entreaties.
Now tell me, Bashaw, what would please the sultan? Gold?
More bicycles?
- Another carriage?
- Lions.
Lions would please the sultan.
Lions are noble.
Very well.
Mr. Dreighton will leave this afternoon for Fez with a pair of lions.
Lions?
We shall drink from my well.
Thank you, William.
That's rather refreshing.
Here, children, have some of these.
They'll give you strength.
Mama, who do you think he really is?
- Is he a pirate?
- He's a brigand and a lout.
Pay him no serious mention. We shall see the better side of this, God willing.
He has the way about him, doesn't he?
He sure has the way.
Woman, I want you to understand this.
I am not a barbarous man.
I am a scholar and a leader to my people.
I am not a barbarous man.
These four men have dishonored me.
They have eaten from my trees.
They have drunk water from my wells.
They have done all of these things to me... and they have not even evoked my name to God in thankfulness.
I am treated this way because
I make war upon the Europeans.
You see the man at the well?
How he draws the water?
When one bucket empties, the other fills.
It is so with the world.
At present, you are full of power.
But you are spilling it wastefully... and Islam is lapping up the drops as they spill from your bucket.
Did you see that?
And you are not a barbarous man!
- They had broken God's will.
- You mean your will!
I have no will, only that of God.
I had to kill the two, or I could not trust the other two.
A barbarous man would have killed them all.
Be not so quick to judge our ways.
Ignorance is a steep hill with rocks at the bottom.
Do you pray often?
- I pray to Mecca five times a day.
- Is that so?
I wonder how you find time. You're so busy cutting off men's heads... and kidnapping women and children.
- If I miss the morning prayer...
I pray twice in the afternoon.
Allah is very understanding.
You gonna build that canal in Panama, Teddy?
I'll dig it with my own hands if I have to!
Remember the Maine!
I remembered it, did you?
Teddy, you ain't gonna let them push us around in Morocco?
Madam, I have something to say about Morocco.
This is a good time as any to say it.
It is my policy...
It's my policy to protect American citizens and American interests... whenever, wherever they are threatened!
And furthermore...
I am not a man to stand by and condone barbaric acts... which are perpetrated against innocent women and children!
We shall mete out justice that is swift and retribution that is final!
American wants Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!
I was good. Wasn't I, John?
It was a marvelous speech.
I'd even vote for you myself.
Have the train go slowly.
I want to listen to them a while.
You will be more pleased here.
Sleep better.
It is the wish of the Raisuli.
Be sure and thank him for me.
You will sleep here.
Yes, I was told.
Good.
You do not want to eat?
This is not a good move.
I can take your knight.
- You can?
- Yes.
Well, the loss of my knight does not mean you will win.
The lion takes long strides, but the path is worn smooth by pygmy armies.
Yes, and a fool and his money are soon parted.
I've checked your queen also.
You are in a lot of trouble.
You should never have moved that bishop or kidnapped me.
Both will see you undone.
It is not I who decides the outcome of these events.
It is the will of Allah.
I am but an instrument of that will.
It is the wind that passes, but the sea remains.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Make your move.
What do you intend to do with us?
It is my intention to embarrass Mulay
Abd Al-Aziz, the sultan to Morocco.
The tribesmen will see that he is the bought dog of the European armies... a slave to French and
German masters.
The tribesmen will join me in a jihad to abolish this foreign pestilence.
And this is your way, abducting women and children, killing unarmed servants?
I prefer to fight the European armies, but they do not fight as men.
They fight as dogs.
Men prefer to fight with swords so they can see each other's eyes.
Sometimes this is not possible.
Then they fight with rifles.
The Europeans have guns that fire many times promiscuously and rend the earth.
There is no honor in this.
Nothing is decided from this.
Therefore, I shall take women and children when it pleases me.
What have you demanded for our return?
Gold... rifles... the head of the Bashaw in a basket of melons... the sovereignty of my people.
The English have paid very well in the past.
You'll not have your way with the Americans.
President Roosevelt will have your head for this!
This President Roosevelt, he would try and take it himself?
He certainly would. He is a man of grit and strong moral fiber.
He does not kidnap women and children!
- What kind of rifle does he use?
- A Winchester.
Winchester?
Winchester?
- I have no knowledge of this rifle.
- You will.
Sharif of Wazan, lord of the desert.
- Mrs. Pedecaris.
- The pleasure is mine.
Charmed.
The sherif has honored me by carrying my entreaties to the Europeans.
What is that?
That is a tongue.
Well, why would anyone want to cut out a man's tongue?
Perhaps the previous owner had nothing pleasant to say.
I believe I'm about to be sick.
Must be the heat.
- What is it?
- Some kind of tongue.
Children, get up from that tongue!
Good God!
The reply from the American Bashaw.
- Speaking for the lord of the Americans.
- President Roosevelt?
"Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead"?
You are not in a position to laugh.
Do not laugh at the Raisuli!
Go to Zinat.
Cut the small finger from a woman, take it to these Americans... tell them it is a finger of the woman Pedecaris... and that the Raisuli is a man of patience, but not unending.
Does this president, this Roosevelt?
Does he have no respect for human life?
Hey, what'd you bring in, colonel?
Got some venison and a cougar.
- Heard about the bear, have you?
- Big one, I heard.
Coffee, Mr. President?
Is that the bear?
Yes, this is the bear that attacked the horse camp at dawn.
He knew that men would be asleep or at their worst at dawn.
He injured one of the Indians severely.
Killed several of the horses too.
Did you participate in stopping the bear, Mr. President?
Yes, I regret to say.
- Why do you regret, Mr. President?
- Because he's a fine creature.
This is his valley.
This valley belonged to the bear, and we're the intruders here.
We're accustomed to wild animals taking flight at the sight of men with guns.
The American grizzly fears nothing... not man, not guns, not death.
Do you intend to have this bear as a rug in the White House?
Rug? No.
No, I intend to have him stuffed and placed on exhibit.
The Smithsonian Institute.
The American grizzly bear is a symbol of the American character.
Strength. Intelligence. Ferocity.
A little blind and reckless at times... but courageous beyond all doubt.
And one other trait that goes with all previous.
- And that, Mr. President?
- Loneliness.
A bear lives out his life alone... indomitable, unconquered, but always alone.
He has no real allies, only enemies, but none of them are as great as he.
Do you feel this might be an American trait?
Certainly. The world will never love us.
It may respect us... they may even grow to fear us, but they will never love us.
For we have too much audacity... and we're a bit blind and reckless at times too.
Are you perhaps referring to the Panama
Canal and the situation in Morocco?
If you say so.
The American grizzly embodies the spirit of America.
He should be our symbol, not that ridiculous eagle.
He's no more than a dandified vulture.
Dandified.
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, sire.
Tell me, why doesn't the sultan build the road to Fez?
I had to bring these lions by camel.
- Do you know what that's like?
- No, sire.
It wasn't easy.
The ease of others is not the concern of the sultan.
- We'll build a road someday.
- A road? Here?
Foolish. The desert is like the sea.
You cannot build a road in the sea.
We will.
We have men that can do anything.
Absolutely anything.
- We have men that can fly.
- Fly?
Fly.
Watch the goal. Watch the goal.
Watch the goal.
Say, haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Perhaps Your Highness would care to fire the Maxim gun?
Herr Sultan is displeased?
This is broken. Mend it!
The ambassador of the American, your exultancy.
I am Mulay Abd Al-Aziz, sultan to Morocco.
It has been said that you have brought me lions.
Yes, sir, two of them.
It's out of bounds.
It would please me to take the pleasure of this meeting in my carriage of state.
You will come.
- Beautiful!
- It is quite extraordinary.
You may sit.
- You wish to discuss the Raisuli?
- Yes.
Have you made any contact with his people?
He wishes for the return of the woman Pedecaris... that he be granted the lands of the RIF by formal decree... and that the Bashaw of Tangier's head be presented in a golden jar.
- He didn't ask for money?
- Yes, but that is honorable.
- You have offered to pay it?
- Do not distress me by such a question.
See here, we will have our people back and right quick... or we will do something about it!
- I will not endure this treatment!
Have you ever heard of the big stick, sultan?
There are squadrons of warships in your coastal waters.
In days there will be Marines, cavalry and artillery to enforce my demands.
Now, my country wants the woman
Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!
You cannot talk to the defender of the faithful in this manner!
You do not understand it!
It is so difficult to be sultan.
You do not understand.
What do you know of this Raisuli?
He is a wonderful man, a servant of God.
But he is a brigand and a criminal as well.
He taught me to shoot a rifle when I was 5 years old.
- You know him?
- He is my uncle.
But the Bashaw in Tangier is your uncle.
They are both my uncles.
They are brothers.
It is so difficult to be sultan.
You foreigners do not understand.
These are my true riches.
A man's worth is counted in the number of his rifles.
Does this Roosevelt?
Does he have such men?
Probably not.
Well, with such men, who needs guns that fire many times promiscuously?
- Machine guns?
- Yes. Who needs such guns?
Well, maybe I don't believe it either.
Look at this.
Where'd you get it, William?
Did you steal it?
No, he gave it to me.
Gayaan the Terrible.
He's a brigand who's killed over 30 men.
Did he kill any with that?
Certainly.
- What will they do with us, William?
- Keep us.
Teach us to ride... shoot... cut men's throats... and be brigands.
- Even girls?
- Yes, but you'll have to wear a veil.
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
That nobody can deny
That nobody can deny
That nobody can deny
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
That nobody can deny
- Happy birthday, Father!
- Happy birthday!
- Blow out the candles, Father!
- Takes a big wind, lots of hot air.
Then I'll need help from you, Mr. Hay.
I propose a toast.
To the Panama Canal.
Yes, and Jupiter Pierpont Morgan.
Likie knifie? You likie forkie?
Splendid.
And now, Mr. President, blow.
May the breath of Theodore Roosevelt be like the wind... that he has sent across the Pacific.
Wind that bends the trees of aggression and injustice.
But a true wind, marked also for its warmth.
An American wind.
You likie speechie?
Well, I suppose I should make the first cut here.
See? Nothing to it.
There you are.
See how easy that was?
Now you all go on and finish it.
- Not having any, Mr. President?
- Oh, no. No cake for me, John... birthday or no.
I have to remain fit and trim, vigorous and active.
After all, this Raisuli fellow is said to be over 50 and still a formidable brigand.
You may well make a formidable brigand yourself.
You've made a good start in life... and we all have high hopes for you when you grow up.
Now I shall have some of your cake.
Let them eat cake, huh, kid?
Not good for you, John.
Neither are those cigars.
I assure you, I can afford it.
Let me see that.
Take a note to the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company, New Haven.
Dear Sirs, I have received my improved model 1895 Winchester in.405 caliber.
As you and I both know, this is a very fine rifle.
However, once again, you have blundered... both in regard to the stock dimensions and the recoil pad.
How long will these mistakes be repeated?
I am the president of the United States.
I see no reason why an American president can't get satisfaction... from an American gun maker!
What must I do for a proper fitting?
Go to England?
- I should hope not.
- No, sir.
Why are you standing there like that, young man?
Speak up. This is a government, not a rest home.
- What is it?
- Your bear, sir.
- My bear? What bear?
- Your grizzly bear, sir.
Oh, the Smithsonian! Yes, you have the sketches. Thank you. Let's see.
Let's see these.
Oh, I'm sorry. That won't do.
No, that's... No, that's all wrong.
That's terrible. And that one...
You see, what's wrong here, young man, is the position.
You've made this fine specimen of a grizzly look like a hairy cow.
Now, would you like to be portrayed as a hairy cow if you were a grizzly bear?
Perhaps the president had a position in mind.
Certainly. There you are.
Now watch.
The American grizzly must always be portrayed in a fighting stance.
That's the sort of animal he is, upright, rampant, on his two hind feet.
His great forepaws extended like that.
Teeth bared, clawing, growling.
Understand?
Would you like to sketch that?
- Take a photograph.
- Good. Ready?
- Growl again, Father.
- You like that?
See that he gets a copy.
Now, where was I with Winchester?
"What must I do for a proper fitting?
Need I go to England?"
Oh, that's all right the way it is.
Send it out.
What must a man do, anyway, to get a proper-fitting rifle?
You can bet that Raisuli fellow's got a rifle that fits him.
Those people know the value of a good weapon.
- The rifle is the very soul of the Arab.
- Raisuli's a Berber, Mr. President.
Well, it goes double for Berbers.
- What sort of rifle does he use?
- I don't know, sir.
Send him a cablegram. Find out what kind of weapon the old bastard uses.
I think you're the best shot that's ever occupied the office, sir.
Oh, I don't know. Andrew Jackson back there was quite a shot.
Carried a brace of pistols all the time, you know.
Shot a fellow right off the porch, right out there.
Caned another one to death.
Admiral Chadwick, I presume.
I'm Vice Consul Richard Dreighton.
- Ray.
- Admiral. It's certainly good to see you.
Captain.
I must say, we've been awaiting your arrival with a great deal of anticipation... and I must say, not a little nervousness.
You see, gentlemen, what we have here... is a problem of enormous diplomatic complexity.
Now, the sultan of Morocco... Make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen.
The sultan of Morocco favors the German kaiser.
While the Bashaw, who is the real power here... is leaning toward the czar of Russia.
Now, in the middle of all this... an American woman is kidnapped by some desert pirate... and our president, of course, gentlemen, only wants to know... what kind of a rifle this brigand carries.
And he probably wants to build a canal too, for all I know.
- It's been done before, you know.
- Now, now, admiral.
Mr. Dreighton, see if the gentlemen care for a cigar. Would you, please?
You and I are both old men and we've seen these disasters come and go.
Now, our problem is to make this one go... and make it look good.
I must remind you, sir, that I was at Santiago Bay... when this president was running up San Juan Hill.
We'll have to do more than just look good this time.
Well, what did you have in mind, exactly?
Military intervention.
Yes. We are at this moment the most powerful naval force in Tangier harbor.
Well, I don't see what that has to do with anything.
We are a major power at this moment.
We carry the biggest stick.
Just how many men do you have, captain?
- Two reinforced rifle companies, sir.
- Well, you see, the sultan of Morocco... has three foreign regiments in Fez.
- That's right, sir. They're at Fez.
The Bashaw has only his household cavalry and guard here.
The power lies with the Bashaw.
Who is this boy?
Let him go on.
We'd be as useless chasing Raisuli as the redcoats on Bunker Hill.
And the sultan, if I'm correct in my assumption, will not meet his demands.
Yes, go on.
The sultan is not the power.
The real government is here.
That's right.
It would seem quite obvious, sir.
We must seize the government and make our own negotiations.
- Seize the government?
- At bayonet point!
I certainly would like to see that old son of a bitch at bayonet point.
But it's ridiculous.
It's outrageous. It's lunatic!
Yes, isn't it, though?
I should think Teddy would love it.
What about the French, the Germans, the British?
- Why, we're in the shadow of Gibraltar.
- Damn the legations!
You realize, of course, that if we fail in this in even the slightest way... we'll all be killed.
Yes. And the whole world will probably go to war.
Gentlemen, if we fail and are killed...
I certainly hope that the world does go to war.
World at war.
A world war.
Now that would be something to go out on.
William. Jennifer. Jennifer!
What is it, Mama? I was sleeping.
Dress quickly in the robes they gave you.
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Where are we going?
- We're going to make good an escape.
- An escape?
Right now? I was asleep.
You cannot wait for these things to occur at your convenience, Jennifer.
Now, I've bribed a man with jewels.
Come on. Get dressed. Hurry up.
Come along. Be quick about it!
The rifle, boy. Rifle!
- Yes, it is mine.
- Give me your rifle. Give it to me, yeah?
You'll get the rifle when we reach safety and not before. Now move ahead.
I'll take the rifle, Willy.
Be careful!
- Help!
- William!
William. William.
Mama!
William!
Get back!
William, get those loose horses there.
Quick.
Jennifer, go with William.
Mrs. Pedecaris, you're a great deal of trouble.
There is all that you need here.
Clothes of the finest silks, spiced meats, figs for you, when you wish to eat.
- Scented water to bathe in.
- But where are your guards?
Is it your intention to let us roam about freely?
You're the guests of the Raisuli... in the Raisuli's house.
I don't need guards.
My eyes are with you wherever you go.
Allah is with me.
No one can escape from God.
What will you do if they do not accept your terms?
What do you mean?
What will become of us, my children and myself?
I will play chess with you one more time and then return you to your house.
Alive?
Yes, of course.
Then you're just bluffing them.
You've never had the intention of killing us.
Raisuli does not kill women and children.
That's a silly question.
Why do you do this?
Because I am bluffing too.
Mrs. Pedecaris, you trouble me.
Ship, oars!
Present arms!
Good morning, sir.
The company is formed.
Sergeants, take your post.
Company... fix bayonets.
Move!
Right face!
Port arms!
Column left, march!
Column right, march!
Eyes... right!
I don't think the French and Germans are gonna like this.
Too early in the morning for rattling sabers.
Double-time... march!
Right on me.
Column left, now!
Column left, march!
Column left!
- Quick-time...
- Quick-time! march!
Third and fourth squads, column right, march.
First and second squads, column right, march.
Mark time... march!
Company... halt!
Hostiles to the left.
Left face!
Firing positions, move!
Aim!
Fire!
Prepare to charge the palace.
Charge!
Capt. Jerome,
United States Marine Corps.
And you are my prisoner, sir.
You are a very dangerous man, captain.
And your President Roosevelt is mad.
Yes, sir.
He's gone cowboy again.
Stand back.
Let me deal with him, or try.
Theodore, what are you doing?
Isn't that the czar?
A facsimile.
That's like shooting at your own brother.
Oh, Kermit's in the pits.
That's his idea of a little joke.
Obviously, you relish jokes in view of your approval of the Gummere report.
I try to go along with them, John.
I suppose a declaration of war would be a joke too?
You have to admit, it would be entertaining.
A barrel of laughs.
Have you any idea of the risk you're running?
Have you any idea of the territory
I'd be gaining?
Theodore.
You're dangerous.
You might even shoot somebody.
Accidentally, I mean.
John, I'd never shoot anyone accidentally. I need their votes.
Madness.
- Madness.
- Sir?
Utter madness.
Why are you closing your left eye?
You told us to shoot with both eyes open.
The light bothers me.
I can't see out of that eye anymore.
- What do you mean?
- I'm blind in my left eye.
- Since when?
- Saturday. Boxing.
Now don't say anything to Edith about it. Do you hear?
Maybe it'll go away.
And don't let anyone come up on my left side either.
Father, is Raisuli a real pirate?
Yes, Quentin, he's the last of the Barbary pirates.
Why do you say that?
Well, the world is fast outgrowing pirates, of that sort anyway.
Do you know any others?
Yes, J.P. Morgan.
He's the only other real pirate I know.
I hope you have him brought before you in chains.
- J.P. Morgan? I should hardly think so.
- No, have Raisuli brought before you.
I should like to see that.
Oh, I should like to see him too, but not in chains.
Let's have the Winchester, Alice.
You like him. Don't you, Father?
You like J.P. Morgan too. Don't you?
Of course I do, Alice.
But they're your enemies.
Well, sometimes one finds that your enemies... are a lot more admirable than your friends.
You pick the road to greatness, and you'll have that choice someday.
You come to realize that the road traveled by great men... is dark and lonely and lit only at intervals by other great men.
And sometimes they're your enemies.
But they're the only true luxury you have.
Yes, it's a dark and difficult road... and I do not look down upon anyone who has the good sense not to take it.
I was young and full of the sayings of young men.
I did not yet understand the ways of the prophet, the will of God.
I thought that men could oppose such will. I was very foolish.
A man can trust no one, yet often trusts women.
I trusted my brother and openly opposed the old sultan at Fez.
He let the Europeans give him money... and money is always followed by more Europeans.
My brother betrayed me, and I was sent to Mogador.
Mogador?
It is a dungeon on the edge of the sea.
I was sent there to die, but I was young and strong.
My brain was as agile as my fingers.
The confinement, speak of the confinement.
It was the intention of my brother to let the flies and the ants consume me.
But as the years passed... and the chains were replaced many times... it was always I who remained.
It was then that the guards saw that the Baraka was with me.
They arranged my escape.
I thanked them for the years of wisdom they had given me.
And I wandered into the mountains.
- Are you asleep?
- No, did I look like it?
No, but you made no noise, and others have fallen asleep while I speak.
The wandering, Raisuli.
Yeah. I wandered into the mountains.
I wished only to hear the voices of women... babbling about common things.
You permit me to say, the conversation of women does not interest me much.
But when one is in prison... one is inclined to have a different sense of disposition.
The Rifians found me.
I learned to read and to speak again.
The women aided me in this because of my lineage... but the men... they wanted to sell my head to the old sultan at Fez for rifles and gold.
There was but one thing to do, challenge Abdel Malak the Cruel.
We fought with swords on horseback.
And the Baraka was with me.
I cut off his arm.
And he wounded me... many times.
The tribesmen judged him, and every voice was against him.
And his eyes, which had witnessed much injustice... were burned out with heated copper coins.
And today he wanders the land a blind beggar.
Thus I became the true defender of the faithful... for the blood of the prophet runs in me, and I am but an instrument of his will.
Raisuli, lord of the RIF,
Salaam. Salaam.
I have never seen such fierce retainers.
Well, these are my immortals.
- They have...
- Put that down!
Let it be!
They are feared in hell... and their courage is such that golden thrones await them in paradise.
You are pleased, sherif?
I am pleased the Raisuli will be pleased.
The Bashaw offers this:
70,000 pieces of Spanish gold.
All foreign soldiers to be removed from the RIF... and the Raisuli and his followers are to be granted the freedom... to travel in the cities and marketplaces.
And last, all those held in the dungeons of Mogador... who swear fealty to Raisuli shall be placed under Raisuli's care.
This in return for the American woman and her children.
It is the word of the American sultan
Roosevelt, and his honor.
Even with treachery, such an offer is impressive.
The American Bashaw wished that the Raisuli act in haste... as the Europeans aren't pleased.
- You must take their offer!
Each day you keep us here... the Europeans use as an excuse to land more troops.
Everything that you have fought for is wasted!
They are using you, Raisuli!
- You are becoming a dupe to them.
- Do not call the Raisuli a dupe!
- I do not need the counsel of women.
- The American woman is true.
Every day more Germans travel to Fez.
They have guns that need wheels to carry them.
What is stopping you?
Can't you see?
It is no longer our concern.
The great powers want this land, and they will fight for it.
When they're done there'll be nothing... not your mountains, nor your palace, not pride, nor honor!
It is a wind so strong no tree can stand in it!
And where there are no trees, there is no shade from the sun.
And what is land without shade from the sun?
Desert.
The desert I know very well.
Mrs. Pedecaris, you speak like a Berber.
It must be the heat.
Why do you do this?
I do not ordinarily ask the counsel of any man... let alone the counsel of women.
You're not even one of my wives!
I should certainly say not.
I am not!
Children, come here.
We have no more business here.
Let these brigands decide what they shall do with us.
Mrs. Pedecaris, I have decided it would please me... to return you to President Roosevelt... because you're a lot of trouble!
Perhaps he will know what to do with you. It is not my fate to find out.
- Even you laugh at the Raisuli.
- This woman has taken the Raisuli.
You say such things in front of my men.
What has become of honor, respect?
Everything is changing, drifting away on the wind.
It's been a bad year.
The next one will probably be worse.
Where do we take them to get our gold?
I will take them. Do not risk your life.
What does my life matter?
I've nothing else to do.
Prepare to ride.
I do not understand this woman.
My entire education has been horses and the Koran.
What have I learned?
Look what I've become.
You are lord of the RIF.
Yes, and you would think
I would understand this woman.
Where exactly are we going?
To a small village east of Rabat at the foot of the mountains.
- It is good.
- What is good?
It is good to know where we are going.
What are they singing?
They are singing songs to God.
Why are you not singing?
I am the sultan. They do the singing.
That is ridiculous!
It is customary.
There is just one thing
I'd like to ask you.
Yes, what is it?
What is your first name?
- My first name?
- Yes, your Christian name.
I mean, what is the name that precedes all your other names?
My first name?
My Christian name?
I am Mulay Achmed Mohammed Raisuli the Magnificent, lord of the RIF.
Mulay. Mulay, that is a nice name.
Yes.
Mulay. I am Eden, Mulay.
Eden. Of course.
You need not go any further.
My retainers will bring back the gold.
What good is the word of the Roosevelt... if it is not met by the word of the Raisuli?
My brother knows this.
I do not fear treachery or fate.
I fear only God.
It is foolish and silly to talk as such.
These Europeans are not men.
They do not respect the laws of men.
Let me take the woman.
He is right.
It is no longer your concern.
No longer my concern?
It is I who took you.
It pleased me to do so.
It pleases me now to bring you back.
No longer my concern.
Sharif, bring your retainers.
The woman, Pedecaris, must not be endangered.
She must return to President Roosevelt.
If there is to be treachery, Allah will not leave my side, but you must.
Ride back, lead the mahalla, let there be jihad.
Let the swords run with the blood of the infidels.
We will all eat lamb in paradise.
Throw down your arms!
They obey only my will, and I am the Raisuli.
I am Mrs. Pedecaris. I do not want my family endangered any further.
Mrs. Pedecaris. Capt. Jerome,
U.S. Marine Corps.
- Help the children.
- Yes, ma'am.
Better take cover inside, ma'am.
Inside. Inside.
I am the sherif of Wazan.
These are my retainers.
They do not ride with this brigand.
Take him if you want!
What will they do to him?
That can't be our concern, ma'am.
We're quite outnumbered here.
Let's go inside.
I expect gold and rifles for his head.
I do not do this for a lackey's wages!
- Can't we get out of here?
- Not until it's light, ma'am.
I wouldn't trust these sorts in the dark.
Mother. Mother, aren't you going to do anything about the Raisuli?
William, the Raisuli is not our concern.
Aren't you gonna do anything?
Go to sleep, William.
Mother.
William!
William.
William, have you got your dagger?
Captain.
Captain, could you bring us some water, please?
Of course, ma'am.
Here we go.
For the boy first, captain, he has a fever.
Here, son, hold your head up.
There we go.
Oh, man!
Don't any of you move!
I shall cut this man's throat if you do not do as I say.
I am not fooling!
Now, drop those weapons!
- You could hurt somebody...
- Don't touch that!
William, get them. Jennifer, help him.
Get the pistols too.
William, give me the short one.
Get up.
Easy with that thing, ma'am.
I have shot grouse in Scotland and quail in North Carolina.
Believe me,
I know how to use this thing.
What are you doing?
What are you trying to get across?
President Roosevelt made an agreement with that man there... and President Roosevelt keeps agreements!
Now, there's no need to do this.
We're all Americans here.
- What exactly did you have in mind?
- I intend to free the Raisuli.
- Alone, I suppose.
- With my children.
Well, I wish you'd said that in the first place.
If you're gonna try it alone, with your children, you haven't got a chance.
What do you suggest I do then, captain?
I'd like to throw in with you.
And God help us.
Draw your weapons from the boy here.
Check for a full load.
My pistol, please.
Halt!
We want to see your prisoner.
I said we want to see your prisoner.
We want to see the Raisuli. President
Roosevelt negotiated in good faith!
What are you doing?
Let's go!
Hurry up! Cover us!
- Oh, my God!
- Mrs. Pedecaris.
The Baraka has not deserted me.
Cut me down quick, before it does.
The sword, woman! The sword!
Better.
Oh, my... Are you hurt?
Mrs. Pedecaris, you're a lot of trouble.
I'll see you again, Mrs. Pedecaris... when we're both like golden clouds on the wind.
There was nothing to worry about,
John.
All I have to do is go to
Oyster Bay for the week end... and the government of Morocco falls.
- By the way, how is Mrs. Pedecaris?
- In fine health, sir.
Quite a remarkable woman.
Capt. Jerome said during the fighting she displayed commendable courage.
That Jerome, I want him decorated with something.
Whatever you think is appropriate.
And Gummere and... What's his name?
Decorate the outfit, all of them.
I say, Theodore, you should thank your lucky stars.
Luck had nothing to do with it.
I had God on my side.
Maybe Allah.
- What's that?
- That's your bear. Your grizzly bear, sir.
First reports are we can get anything we want in Morocco, sir.
Coaling rights. We can put anybody on the throne.
Their camps were divided.
At this moment, Theodore is the most popular president in history.
- Take that cover off.
- What, sir?
Take the cover off.
I wanna see my bear.
- Later perhaps, Theodore.
- No, I want to see him now.
A good speech would be appropriate soon. Even the papers are cheering you.
There's no doubt about the outcome of the election.
Gentlemen, nothing in this world is certain, absolutely nothing.
The fate of the nation will be decided by the people in November.
And the fate of Morocco will be decided tomorrow by me.
Now, gentlemen, if you don't mind,
I'd just like to be alone with my bear.
I trust he was a Democrat.
To Theodore Roosevelt.
You are like the wind, and I like the lion.
You form the tempest.
The sand stings my eyes and the ground is parched.
I roar in defiance, but you do not hear.
But between us there is a difference.
I, like the lion, must remain in my place.
While you, like the wind, will never know yours.
Mulay Achmed Mohammed
El-Raisuli the Magnificent... lord of the RIF, sultan to the Berbers.
Great Raisuli, we have lost everything.
All is drifting on the wind, just as you said.
We have lost everything!
Sharif, is there not one thing in your life that was worth losing everything for?
Thank you for downloading!

On the window.
- This line...
- The window.
- Very exact.
- Thank you, sir.
But you don't come here to draw, to write poems...of to dream.
Do you Baumer?
No.
Sit down.
Gentlemen, you have all passed your examinations.
As you know, you are graduated.
The time for class is over.
The time for duty has begun.
You are dismissed. Herr Baumer...
You may stay.
Cigarette?
No, thank you, sir.
Oh, you don't smoke.
Well, it is not a good habit.
But all good habits, makes a dull person.
What do the English say?
- All work and no play makes...
- A dull man.
A dull... Yes, yes, very good.
There's a time for work and for play.
You are a dreamer, Baumer.
You draw little sketches and write little poems.
But now you're a man, you have your duties as a man, your duty to the Fatherland.
Will you wait to be called up of will you enlist?
- Well...
- Of course, you'll respond to duty.
You will all respond.
The entire class will go as one man to serve the Fatherland.
I know I will be proud of you,
Baumer.
'Today is wonderfully good.
'Everyone has eaten for two men and the mail has come.
'The grasses sway like tall spears.
'The white butterflies float on the soft warm wind.
'Let's not even think about it.
'Let's just enjoy the world.
'Everything is new and brave.
'Red poppies, the good food,
'cigarettes and the summer breeze.'
Paul? Paul?
We're going to see Kemmerich.
Nurse, can you tell me where Franz Kemmerich is?
Yes, he's through there.
Franz.
How are you?
Someone stole my watch.
- Bastards!
- I warned you, Franz.
- I know.
- We'll tell the doctor.
You'll be going home soon.
Do you think?
I feel... I'm all right.
My foot. It's so painful.
It's so cold.
That pain is your ticket home.
You should be grateful to that pain. telling fat lies to Katrine Hammerschmidt.
Here's some smokes and a piece of cheese from Kat, and your comb is in the tobacco tin.
Put them under the bed, please.
Hide them.
You know they stole my watch.
Franz, will you be taking these back home with you?
Why not?
Well, you don't really need boots back home.
We could trade.
- I've got...
- No! My mother gave me those.
- You could lend them to me?
- No.
You'll be home a lot sooner than us.
Orderly. Orderly!
They don't come. They never come.
We'll get someone.
- It'll be different at home.
- When you return...
- ..We'll be together.
- We'll come tomorrow.
- I'll come tomorrow.
- Thank you. Thank you.
I'll be back.
Make sure you get my watch.
We will.
You think I don't care about Franz.
Of course I care.
If I could save his leg or life, I'd walk over barbed wire. You know that.
But where he's going, he won't need his boots.
He won't need anything.
And my boots hurt. They really hurt.
Why should some damn orderly get his boots and not one of his friends.
He's right, Paul.
I know.
Very good, Kemmerich.
Very good, Kemmerich.
They've amputated my leg.
Could be worse.
Wegler lost his right arm, which is very much worse.
Besides, you're going home.
Do you think so?
Of course.
Do you think so?
Once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Don't talk nonsense.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You will.
You can do anything.
If you find my watch, send it home.
You'll go to a convalescent home.
Maybe the one in Klosterberg.
Remember how we hiked up there?
Remember the poplars?
The stream full of fish?
Franz, Franz... When I come back, we go up to the mountains again.
You can name all the trees for me.
Tell me all about them.
Franz, nothing will change.
We'd be together again.
Franz.
Franz.
Give...Müller...my...boots.
Doctor? Doctor?
Where's the doctor? Doctor!
Doctor!
Where's the doctor?
Doctor?
Doctor! Quickly,
Franz Kemmerich is dying.
Which one's that?
Bed 36, amputated leg.
How should I know that?
I've amputated five legs today.
You see to it.
Today there have been sixteen deaths, yours will be the seventeenth.
There'll probably be twenty altogether.
We must take him away at once.
We need the bed.
They're lying on the floor outside.
Paul.
Yes, Mrs Kemmerich?
- I want you to promise.
- What, Mrs Kemmerich?
- Look after Franz.
- Of course...
He looks up to you.
He'll do anything you ask, you know?
Make him stay away from danger.
You know how reckless he is.
I'll make sure he behaves himself.
God bless you both.
Maria, Maria.
Look after your brother.
I'll see you soon. Take care.
Bye-bye, Mother, bye-bye.
Right, come on, boys. Wake up!
Let's go. Hey, wake up there.
Come on.
Come on, come on, Come on!
It's beautiful here. Come on.
Let's go. Wake up. Food.
Come on.
Oh, Kat.
I don't know how you do it.
Next time you come with me,
I'll show you how to find food.
When I'm not here, it'll come in handy.
What? You'll always be here.
Ah, up here
'always' isn't a long time.
Anyway, you'd better learn so you won't go hungry.
You pay attention to the teacher.
He's coming. He's coming.
What did he want?
Doesn't matter. We're free.
Time for work, for duty.
You will enlist, the entire class.
Of course.
Behm, you too.
- Maybe I can't. My eyes.
- They will.
But not tonight.
Tonight we get drunk.
Iron Youth. Iron Youth.
To Max's!

Rirle. Fill your pack.
No, no, Corporal.
You must keep your eyes open, Corporal.
Attack!
Lay down.
Your training days are over.
You are soldiers now in the Imperial Army.
In the front lines you will understand the value and the purpose of all you've learned here, everything your officers have taught you.
Their ways have sometimes seemed harsh to you, for the lessons they taught you in this camp.
They've taught you to be soldiers.
To be soldiers in the service of Almighty God, the Kaiser and the Fatherland.
Right...face.

Fifth company, get down.
Hold up.
Second Company.
This way. Fall out, two ranks.
So... Here you are.
It's the custom to assign one old hand to every new platoon.
You're the new platoon.
I'm the old hand.
I'll teach you practic...
Listen to me, boy.
I'll teach you practical things.
And how to kill Frenchies.
First we'll give you hot food, let you get some sleep,
Tonight.
Frenchie wants to say hello.
You just stick close to Kat, and move when I tell you to move.
Get down. Off the road.
Take cover. Off the road!
Shoot the wounded horses!
Shoot them!
Shoot them, can't you?
Shoot them.
Hey! You're crazy?
You want to kill somebody?
Get down.
Why? What have they done?
They haven't done anything.
Using horses is wrong.
It's wrong killing horses.
Come on, let's go, boys.
Get up.
Up. Come on, boys.
Everybody here?
Huh? Link up, boys.
A taste of the real thing.
You'll get used to it.
You ready?
All right.
Well, you're almost getting to be soldiers now.
You stick with Kat and you'll be all right.
'We have been at the front for a year. We are soldiers now.
'We know this place well.
'We are at home.
'Only Kemmerich is dead but we keep hearing about others in our class;
'dead, wounded.
'If a shot comes, all we can do is duck,
'because we can never know where it will fall.
'I can be smashed to bits in a bomb-proof dugout,
'of I can survive ten hours unscathed out in the open.
'Of course, every soldier believes in chance and trusts his luck.
'But no soldier outlives a thousand chances.
'We call them corpse rats.
'They have shocking evil faces and even on our empty stomachs,
'it is nauseating to see their long naked tais.
'The bait is bread, so rotten even we won't eat it.
'they'll come among us to snatch them away.
'It's a way to pass the time.'
Gas masks. Gas masks.
'Gas, the most feared, most obscene weapon of all.
'We remember the awful sights in the hospital.
'The gas patients who, surfocating,
'cough up their burned lungs in clots.
'Better take your chances in the open
'than stay in the hollows where the vapours settle.'
'The new recruits are more trouble than they are worth.
'Between five and ten get killed to every old hand.
'And they get killed simply because they are so inexperienced.
No, don't! No!
Get him.
Hand me a rifle. Hand me a rifle.
Kat, wait!
A baby.
Just a baby.
They're in position.
- Nearby?
- Yes, sir.
'How long has it been?
'Weeks, months, years? Only days.
'Yesterday we were under fire.
Today we can rest.
'Tomorrow we go up to the trenches again.'
Boys, boys, come here.
Look, you boys go on that side.
Over here. This way.
Easy, easy.
Get around, get around up there.
This way.
It's gone.
Quick, he'll get away.
Get him, get him, get him!
Someone eat the liver. I'm on a diet. and the sturfing would have been something very special.
But all considered...
A feast. I feel like a king.
Ah, not bad, not bad.
Like I say, it's not a bad little war.
You never answered my question, Joseph.
What question?
What we'll all do. Get drunk.
Of course he'll get drunk.
Then it's back home and mama and all that.
But what ese?
Well, tell him, Joseph.
Don't be ashamed.
I'm not ashamed.
He's going to theology school to be a minister.
A year here and you haven't changed your mind about that.
Is God still in his heaven?
Nothing ever changes that.
What about you?
Back to the cobbler's bench, eh?
And the children.
How many you got?
Don't ask.
Good thing I'm a shoemaker, of I'd go broke just buying shoes.
More coffins.
A bigger load than usual.
That means a bigger offensive.
How considerate they are at headquarters.
Come on, get this one down.
Haul them up.
Careful, careful.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
Next year, fight out of the cradle.
Did you notch this bayonet?
Yes, sir.
Who told you to?
- At the training camp...
- Training camp, eh?
Sonny, if the enemy ever caught you with this, they wouldn't kill you,
Nobody uses these things any more.
It's by mutual agreement, on both sides.
I didn't know.
- First time?
- Yes, sir.
Don't 'sir' me. I'm a private.
Sorry, I thought...
Don't think. Just listen.
Yes, sir.
Your spade is better.
You hit a man under the chin.
Take his head off.
It's a good club, too.
Cos it's heavy.
Hit a man between neck and shoulder.
Right here. Split him right in two.
- Mother of God!
- It's cleaner.
Bayonet gets stuck in ribs, you have to kick him to pull it out.
Time it takes, you're a dead man.
Understand?
Now, where is your platoon leader?
Corporal Himmestoss said he'd meet us here.
Ah.
Corporal who?
Himmestoss.
From Oldenberg training station?
Yes, sir.
I don't believe it!
Vengeance is mine.
No, sir. He got into trouble.
Overdid it with two trainees on the muddy field. You know the field?
Do we know the muddy field?
He went too far. Almost killed them.
He didn't see the son of the local magistrate watching.
So, he's here.
Of course he'd spoil it for himself.
Oh, Lord. I can hardly wait.
Oh, well. Look who's here.
Well, we meet again.
Kropp, isn't it? You remember me,
Corporal Himmestoss.
Müller, you here too?
Oh, yes, I remember you very well.
Lehr, Behm, Baumer...Baumer.
Nothing wrong with my memory!
You've all managed to stay alive.
Not Kemmerich.
Kemmerich?
I don't remember Kemmerich.
The rest of you seem to have learned your lessons pretty well. don't you turn your back.
What did you say?
So this is the great
Corporal Himmestoss?
And who are you?
I asked you a question, soldier.
Himmestoss.
There's a latfine down the road.
Why don't you take a jump?
Do you want to be court martialled?
Stand up straight, hees together, when your superior officer speaks to you.
All of you!
Squad, attention!
Right...face.
Right turn, forward...march.
Left, left, left, left.
Left, left, left, left, left, left.
Easy, boy, easy.
It'll be all right.
Ah, you see the way he blows up?
Boom, like that.
Want to kill Frenchmen?
You'll be all right, boy.
You'll get used to it.
To soften us up so we can't sleep.
Huh, then when they attack, we won't be able to fight back because we're too tired.
Two days and nights. How much longer?
Not too long, not too long.
Why don't they stop?
Where are you going?
I'll be back...in a minute.
No, just relax. Wait. It'll be over soon. Come on, sit down and relax.
Let me go. I must get away.
Sit down and calm down.
Now, go and sit down.
Behave yourselves. Be easy, quiet.
I said...
Come on, let's go.
Come on...come on.
'No longer do we lie helpless, awaiting destruction.
'We can destroy and kill to save ourselves and to be revenged.
'When we see their faces, we become wild beasts.
'We turn into thugs and murderers.
'Into God only knows what devis.
'If your own father was with them,
Forward!
Fire.
What the hell is this?
Come on, let's go. Come on, you all.
Come on, move. You too, soldier.
Come on, let's go. let's go, let's go.
What's happening down there?
Come on.
Come on!
Come on!
'How long is it? Days, of weeks, of months, of years?
'Attack, counter-attack.
And the dead pile up.
'Winter, summer... The days are hot and the dead lie unburied.
'The shels will bury them.
'But when the wind blows, it brings the smell of blood,
'which is heavy and sweet.'
No, shh...shh...
Shh! Shh!
No, no...
- No, shh. Je vous...
Je vous...help...
I want to help you.
Ohh!
I didn't want to kill you.
But you jumped in here like that.
What would you have done? It's... face to face.
I just saw your rifle... your bayonet... grenades.
If we threw all those away... we could be brothers.
But they never want us to know that, do they?
They never want us to know.
We each have mothers... fathers... the same... fear of death.
The same... pain.
The same... everything.
Everything.
Forgive me, comfade.
I could write...to your family.
Yes...
Yes, I'll write!
'Gefard Duval, compositeur.
'I have killed
Gefard Duval the printer.'
Battalion, attention!
Present arms!
Eyes left!
Battalion Commander, sir.
Your Majesty, I have the honour to bring you the salute of the 150th Infantry Battalion.
Your Majesty,
Soldier Bernard.
Your Majesty,
Soldier Langer.
Your Majesty,
Corporal Himmestoss.
Battalion! At ease!
Officers, non-commissioned officers, enlisted men.
The men who have received decorations this day
From this day on, your Kaiser urges you all to aspire to such strength, to such bravery, to such obedience to your God and your country.
If you do, my soldiers,
I am certain you will all one day wear a medal pinned on you by your Kaiser.
You have all done your duty as noble German warriors.
You have shown the world our might.
You have stricken our enemies with fear.
It'll take weeks to get to the skin!
- Give me that soap?
- How's the water?
Beautiful! Come on in!
Hey! Look at that!
Hello! Bonjour, bonjour!
Jolies! Jolies!
Somebody do something!
Just don't let them get away!
Allo, Mademoiselles!
Allo, Mademoiselles!
Attendez, s'il vous plait!
Tell them to come over.
Er, yes, er... Mademoiselle, you come over this side, oui?
- We want to talk.
- Talk?!
Parlez vous, Mademoiselles!
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!
Frauleins, l'amour, yes?
You coming over, we have l'amour, yes?
Oui, oui, oui.
- Don't go!
- Yoo-hoo!
Gifs! Fraulein, bread, yes?
You want bread?
Look! Regardez!
Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum, yes? Bread!
You come over here, oui?
Vous!
Venez!
Ici!
Ce soir!
Vous venez!
Lá-bas!
Nótre maison!
They want us to come to their house tonight!
Oui! Avec quelque chose a manger, oui?
- With something to eat!
- La maison lá!
Maison!
- Bonjour! Bonjour! Bonjour!
- Bye! Bye!
Drink up, Tjaden.
It's bad luck there's four of us and three of them.
Mm-hmm... Bad luck.
See, it's just not fair to the gifs.
Drink up, Tjaden. How often do you get good French wine?
Not fair to the gifs... No.
One of us will have to make the supreme sacrifice.
Mmm?
Bottoms up, Tjaden, you're not keeping up with us.
Maybe we should draw lots?
You lose.
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.
This looks like the right line-up, huh?
I'm all for this one.
You like yours, Albert?
Yes.
Paul?
Mais tu es blanc comme neige, je crois.
Er...
Est-ce que je me trompe, petit bon homme.
Oui!
Mon petit soldat.
Non, non. Ici.
- Quelle age a-tu?
- Eh?
- Ton age?
- No...
- Quelle age a-tu?
- Ah! I'm 19.
19... Oh!
Vingt-cinq ans? Vraiment?
Look out! Look out! Take cover!
- My leg!
- Come on, Albert! Up! Up!
Come on, boys, a little bit more.
Down! Stay down!
I'll be right back!
Hey!
Paul!
Take care!
Kat.
Kat!
Kat, come on!
- All right.
- Easy, easy.
- From Kat.
- What is it?
- It's a long ride.
- Oh, bread and cheese!
He could find a lobster dinner in the middle of the desert!
Goodbye.
- Take care, Paul.
- Bye.
'Albert and I are in a Catholic hospital.
- Won't see him again.
- Why not?
The "Dead Room"?
What's the Dead Room?
The Dying Room, whatever you call it.
It's in the basement.
It's convenient really.
It's next to the mortuary.
No one ever comes back.
'The beds empty quickly, and new occupants take their places.
'It is going badly with Albert.
He is in much pain.
'Last night one of our wardmates awakened with a severe haemoffhage.
They won't take me! No! NO!
We're taking you to the bandaging room.
I won't go to the Dying Room!
We're not going there.
Then why take his tunic?
- I'll be back. I won't die!
- Why are you taking his tunic?
I'll come back!
I won't die! I'll come back!
Liars!
They're lying.
LIARS!
I'll come back!
I'll come back! I won't die...
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop that! Orderly!
Get the orderly! Doctor!
Orderly! Orderly!
Why didn't you leave him alone?
You are doing so well, Paul.
Soon we'll throw away the cane.
- Sister.
- Yes?
I'm worried about my friend.
I think...he is making a very good recovery.
He worries me.
Since the operation, he...
He's in a terrible state of mind.
He hardly speaks to me any more.
There is always such a reaction after an amputation.
Always!
Now, stop worrying.
Albert will get over it.
Go, tell him your good news.
That should cheer him up.
Albert?
How do you feel?
Albert, they're giving me 16 days convalescent leave. I'm going home.
They'll be sending you home, too.
Is there anything I can get you?
A gun.
A what?
You want to get me something?
Get me a gun.
- Will you get me a gun or not?
- No! Don't talk nonsense!
No, you talk sense.
Albert...
I'm sorry.
Paul?
Paul! Why didn't you tell us you were coming?
Mother. Mother!
Paul? Come up.
Give me your handkerchief.
How is she?
She's in bed.
She's sick, Paul.
What is it?
We don't know.
But...Dr Bradermeier thinks... it's probably the cancer again.
Thank God.
Oh, thank God.
Thank God.
Are you wounded, Paul?
No... No, I'm just on leave.
- Oh, Paul.
- How are you?
I'm going to try to get up a little today, I think.
Good.
My Paul.
My Paul.
Look.
Bread.
And cheese and...butter!
They feed you enough where you are?
Not always enough, but we manage.
Is it very bad there?
No.
Not so bad.
Heinrich Bradermeier was here and said it's terrible out there, with the gas attacks and all the rest of it.
It's just talk.
Just talk.
Look at me, I'm well and fit, aren't I?
Yes.
But then...
It's more comfortable,
Father, that's all.
But I...I want to show off our soldier boy to the fellows at Max's.
You look well, Paul. Fit.
War agrees with you, eh?
- I suppose, in a way.
- Have a cigar.
If you're old enough to kill Frenchmen, you can smoke.
Hans, another beer for our young warrior.
What's the spirit like out there?
Excellent, eh?
The enemy has many reserves,
Mr Hollerstein.
You only see your little sector,
The important thing is the breakthrough, here in Flanders.
This is Frenchie, this is us.
We have to come found the Belgian side and fam through.
There's no other way.
Before we beat them on the Hindenburg line?
It is borders that are important.
You're quite wrong.
Good soldiers never stay planted on borders like turnips...
You're lying to me, Paul.
I know you are.
I swear to you, he died instantly.
- You promised he wouldn't get hurt.
- Mrs Kemmerich, I...
Why are you living when he is dead? Why?
What right have you?
Tell me again.
Did you...see it?
Yes, I was fight there next to him.
He died at once. He never suffered.
I know that you're trying to comfort me,
I want to know the...
I want the truth!
I have to hear it!
Mrs Kemmerich, I promise, that's exactly how it happened.
His face was quite calm.
- Do you swear it?
- Yes.
By everything that is sacred to you?
By everything that is sacred to me.
He died at once.
May I never come back... if he wasn't killed instantly.
Carry that lesson to the front lines
You are dismissed.
Baumer.
Paul Baumer!
Baumer!
- Here, have a cigarette.
- No, thank you.
You still haven't picked up the habit. Well, that's good.
It's not a good habit but a man has to have vices.
How does it go? All work and no play... You remember?
How is it, Baumer?
How...how is the spirit?
Excellent, eh? Excellent?
Behm is dead.
Behm?
Josef Behm.
Oh. You know,
I didn't think he would enlist.
But he went.
Yes...
Kemmerich is dead, too.
I was told.
And Kropp has lost a leg.
Er... Oh, Albert Kropp, yes.
I don't know about all the others. We were separated, but Leer's alive and Müller is alive and I'm alive.
I'm glad to hear that.
Tell them...
Tell them I'm proud to have taught them to be good Germans.
To know that you have all done your duty by the Fatherland.
Imagine how that makes me feel?
You were a good class. Good boys.
Good boys all.
- And this class?
- This lot?
They haven't got your spirit, Baumer.
Not the Iron Youth, eh?
Mm? I'm sorry...?
No Iron Heroes?
Just boys.
Want to play.
Laugh.
To stay alive.
Only boys.
Mother, it's late.
You should be asleep.
Did I wake you, dear? I'm sorry.
You'll catch cold here. Go sleep.
I can sleep enough later.
Are you very much afraid?
No.
I'd like to tell you to be on your guard against the women in France.
They're no good.
Mother, where we are there aren't any women.
- Yes, I will.
- I pray for you every day.
I know, Mother.
Perhaps you can get a job that is not so dangerous?
Perhaps in the cookhouse.
That could be easily done.
Do it, then, and if others say anything...
I won't let that bother me.
Now, you must sleep,
Mother. Come on.
'Mother, I used to live in this room. All my things are here.
'All my books, my beloved books,
'but they no longer speak to me as they used to,
'for I am not what I was when I lived here.
'I am a soldier. My business is not reading, it is killing.
'My knowledge of life is limited to death,
'and I know now
I should never have come back.
'because it has no meaning.
'My companions at the front are the only truth I know.
'I depend on them and I depend on nothing ese.
'Mother, it's a terrible thing to say,
'but I feel I am now going back to my real home.'
Paul!
- Well, you're back, my boy.
- Yes, I'm back.
You're a fool.
I'm glad to see you, anyway.
I'm glad to see you, too, Kat.
They're getting younger and younger, Paul.
Our hands'll be full just taking care of them.
Hey! The old deserter's back!
- How was your leave?
- Good. Where's Müller?
- When was it?
- A week ago.
Was it quick?
Shrapnel in the stomach.
He lasted two hours.
Damn!
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant!
Leer! No, leave him!
He's gone! He's gone!
Leer! Come back!
God!
Oh, GOD! GOD! GOD! GOD!
- Ready! Charge!
- Let's go!
'There isn't much. We are all going hungry. We are all tired.
'We are all hopeless.
But the war goes on.'
Why don't they just let it end?
Ah, who knows?
We're finished.
Our bread is nothing but sawdust.
You see anybody that hasn't got dysentery and colic?
Artillery's burned out.
Damned barres are so worn down
Too many guns, tanks.
Now the Americans are pouring in.
New guns, aeroplanes, fresh troops.
Lie still.
- Just as it's ending!
- Be quiet!
- After four years.
- Stretcher!
- Stretcher bearer!
- Just as it's ending.
It's all right. Just lie still.
Don't worry, it looks like a clean wound.
Just hold on.
Stretcher!
Can you stand up?
You can get up?
Come on. Come on! Come on!
I've got to carry you.
Ready? Up.
Sorry.
That's all right. That's all right.
We gotta keep going. You ready?
Yes, yes.
Come on.
- You got it?
- I'll try.
- No.
- No, I'll try.
No, you can't. It's all right.
No.
It's his shin, he's fainted.
C'mon, Kat, come on.
He was talking.
Ten minutes ago.
We were talking.
'It is Autumn.
We wait for the end.
'We wait for the Armistice.
'We wait for peace.'
'a bullet in the head.
'Himmestoss was killed the same day
'and now Detering is gone.
'I think we started to lose Detering last spring,
'when the apple trees came into bloom.
'You know that expression of his in springtime?
'A week later he was caught by the Military Police.

PART TWO
We resume our story of Molière's life as he begins 15 years of wandering.
He is by humors possessed!
These humors will rise up through your duodenum until they reach your cerebellum!
I have found you out, my faithless wife, while my head is on the pillow, you peccadillo!
He flatters you in order to betray you.
In the provinces, they don't like tragedy.
We might at least try it.
I have tried. They threw baked apples at me.
So I stopped trying.
That never happened to me.
I don't know.
I don't know how to act like that.
I can't!
Calm down and try again.
Poor Sganarelle, you're old and sick.
No, no, no!
Old people don't want to be sick.
Just think about it!
They try to walk erect!
The flesh may be weak but the spirit is still willing.
Follow me.
That's better, it's all in the eyes.
That's it.
Madeleine!
Got it!
Got it!
I'm sick.
I'm old.
What do you want?
I'm scared.
Good evening, Thérèse.
Move, Hercules!
Madeleine, come and see!
Just try!
Push!
Wait till Maimé tells us to push!
Because you can't push until you're told to?
You, too, push!
I am pushing!
Who got us into this mud-hole?
I'm seven years older than he is.
It worries me sometimes.
In 20 years it won't show.
You're wrong.
That kind of breach always grows.
Tell me, did you hate me for it?
No, I'm not jealous of you.
That even surprises me, in fact.
And Thérèse?
She's no threat, she's a brunette!
Madeleine, we were just talking!
Madeleine!
When you depict heroes it's just a portrait.
It needn't be life-like.
But ordinary men must be drawn from nature, recognizable as men of your times.
Otherwise you've done nothing!
So Corneille has done nothing!
Muses, grant me patience!
Who's talking about Corneille?
Forget Corneille.
A serious play, to be above reproach, only needs to be sensible and well-written.
In comedy, that's not enough.
You must be amusing, too.
Have you finished?
And so the years went by with their joys and their sorrows.
Stand back, actors!
Stand back, heretics!
Away from the benediction of the Lord!
The child, Menou, was becoming the girl, Armande.
Louis XIV was also growing up.
Always comedy!
They're at it again!
A tragedy is a thing of beauty.
A tragedy is a thing of beauty, when well-written.
I prefer a comedy.
Both are difficult.
You must admit the farces we present do not resemble comedies.
There is no comparison between such absurd farces and the beauty of serious plays.
Comedy is more difficult.
Fool! Ignoramus! Idiot!
It is easier to accuse...
Keep still!
Let us eat in peace!
It is wrong to accuse fate and insult the gods, rather than to share the shortcomings of men.
Then forget the sublime, forget sacrifice, forget courage, forget honor and there is nothing.
Eat slowly.
One day, along the way, they encountered
Charles Coypeau d'Assoucy, vagabond and poet.
They liked his looks and took him with them.
What news from Paris?
England has been a republic for a year now.
The leaders of the Fronde have been exiled to the provinces.
One of them, the Prince de Conti, took refuge near here.
Descartes is dead.
Descartes is dead?
The King has returned to Paris.
In short, all is not well, except for an Italian musician sent to us by the heavens.
His name is Lully.
He is highly talented and knows it.
He is trying to win the King over.
I dare say he will succeed.
- Tell me you love me.
- Oh, my Gros-René!
Gentlemen...
We serve Monsieur de Conti!
We will receive you at his chateau.
At last!
We're going to perform tragedy.
Pack up, we're going to be warm this winter.
First we finish, then we pack up.
We have a patron now.
You can't refuse the Prince de Conti.
I want no more of this repertory.
I want no more of this wandering!
I'm through, too.
Then leave!
We'll go on performing.
For whom?
My lord,
Monsieur Molière is here.
My lord, may I present the actresses and the actors of our troupe to you?
Mademoiselle Madeleine Béjart,
Mademoiselle de Brie,
Monsieur Joseph Béjart,
Monsieur Louis Béjart,
Monsieur Du Parc
Mademoiselle
Marquise Thérèse Du Parc.
You will have to make me laugh a great deal.
L'Etourdi... The Blunderer
If the title's bad!
It's excellent.
The characters:
Lélie, son of Pandolfe,
Célie, a slave,
Mascarille, Lélie's valet,
Hypolyte, son of Anselme,
Anselme, his father,
Trufaldin, an old man,
Pandolfe, a gentleman,
Andres, thought to be Egyptian,
Ergaste, Mascarille's friend, a messenger and a troupe of mummers, no, two troupes.
The set is set in Messina.
Music...
Act I,
Scene I.
Lélie and Léandre,
Lélie: "Well, Léandre,
"we shall have to begin.
"We'll soon see...
"who'll win"
"who'll win."
Preamble, out!
I didn't have enough time.
Act I,
Scene II.
Marotte!
No one's listening.
Everyone is!
- Louis isn't.
- He is!
- I am!
- With your eyes shut, you can't hear!
- I can.
- You can't!
- I can repeat it.
- Repeat it!
L'Etourdi, a comedy by Molière.
Get on with it!
Let's hear if it's a good comedy.
Act I, Scene I...
Léandre and Lélie
Lélie:
"Well, Léandre, we shall have to begin.
"We'll soon see who'll win.
"We shall compete for this young miracle,
"each hoping to overcome any obstacle."
The season has started badly.
We're having November in the month of May.
Monsieur de Conti is not here.
He is visiting
Monsieur d'Apremont, who is most devout and highly partisan.
May heaven grant that he not return to us in the guise of a fanatic.
The state of grace in which I now find myself, the order of truth... and the law of Christian discipline condemn the immoral pleasures of your spectacles.
Sensuality exerts such power over men!
I was damning my soul, with your help.
You condemn to hell all who listen to you, enchanted by your grimaces which blaspheme the Holy Name of Jesus.
You are evil.
But we know how to silence you.
Cover yourself, madame!
And now stop barring the path to my salvation!
I shall soon be in Paris.
If you need help, you may count on me.
Armande, come see.
Menou, come see Paris.
Their friend kept his promise.
He introduced them to Monsieur, the King's brother.
If Your Highness will do us the honor, these are the gentlemen of the troupe.
And Monsieur La Grange, a newcomer.
Make way for the King!
The King has passed.
Monsieur de Cosnoc,
I give my name to the troupe of Monsieur...
I take them under my protection.
In ten days they shall play at the palace.
Your Highness has, in Monsieur Molière, a loyal servant, whose devotion knows no bounds.
Come see, he's wearing an enormous hat.
With feathers!
And he has a big nose...
He's there!
I must relieve myself.
Wait, I'll go with you.
Me, too.
I'm going, too.
Thus returned in glory it is sweet, my Lord, to greet thee, to behold again thy honored dignity.
Though fate has been kind and to mercy inclined, my heart is sore-stricken, and troubled is my mind.
I sorrow to see thee though with loving eyes, for fear that it be true that my love is unwise.
They're making a Nicomess out of Nicomède!
To disguise her fears and jealousy behind this lying mask of false constancy is her sole task.
Hold me back or I'll strangle him!
Take up once more your royal scepter.
A true king is neither husband nor father, he looks to his throne, naught else must matter.
Rule!
Rome shall fear you more than you fear Rome.
I don't understand.
Could the play be bad?
The play is very good, one of Corneille's best.
Go apologize to the King and his brother!
Apologize to the Cardinal and everybody!
Do Le Docteur Amoureux and make them laugh!
Get to work...
Get to work...
Get to work...
Get to work...
Sganarelle... scoundrel!
Sganarelle... scoundrel!
Sganarelle, sweep that up!
Sganarelle, sweep that up!
All that!
Your Majesty, look at all that.
Your Majesty,
I don't want to sweep all that.
Your Majesty, please...
We were much amused by you, monsieur.
The King's given them the Petit Bourbon.
To share with the Italians?
Good luck to them!
Monsieur Scaramouche...
You see before you your most devoted disciple.
The Pretentious Young Ladies
Sganarelle or The Imaginary Cuckold
The School for Husbands
And the troupe began to change little by little.
What's the matter?
I'm thinking of leaving.
I need a change.
And Thérèse?
She's free, she can do as she likes.
Are you staying or leaving?
She's going to the Marais!
I'm old enough to speak for myself.
And too old for some things.
I'm not still playing virgins at age 35!
Looking at you, I can play virgins till I'm 150!
You're getting so fat he'll have to write a role for an elephant.
After all, why force them to stay?
I'm not forcing anyone to stay.
I'm waiting for your advice.
Try the Marais.
They'll write roles for you.
As if that were the point.
What else are we talking about?
Who writes plays for those two?
Who always gives them the best roles?
- That I must say...
- Keep still, Beauval!
Leave it to women to argue about their roles.
Who cares about that?
Not you! You've been pampered.
Pampered? Me?
You can have my roles... take them!
If you're capable of playing them.
It's what you've waited for!
I'm not leaving.
- I'm being chased out!
- I'm being chased out, too.
We're not needed now that you have your royal stipend.
Paris is at your feet, you'll be rich and famous.
I want some glory for myself!
And we're not married, to the best of my knowledge.
They'll come back.
- Don't worry.
- What do I care?
La Grange was right.
Thérèse and Gros-René soon came back.
The contract.
Were present: Jean-Baptiste
Poquelin, Sieur de Molière,
René Berthelot...
That's me!
Damoiselle Marquise Thérèse de Gorla, his wife and Madeleine Béjart, being over 18...
The aforenamed have, of their own free will, voluntarily formed an association to perform in the theater together for a period of four years.
Four!
They may not perform separately, for any other troupe...
Any other troupe! in Paris or in the provinces.
Not even the Hotel de Bourgogne.
Not even the Hotel de Bourgogne!
Penalty for infractions shall be 10,000 pounds, as damages.
I want to...
I want to take advantage of this moment...
I want to take advantage of this moment to ask the troupe here united for an extra share of the profits in addition to those I now receive.
It's not for me.
It's for me!
It's for my wife, in the event that I should marry.
I would like to remind the company of costumes I lent to
The Illustrious Theater.
I've never been paid for them.
I claim for that debt today.
- After 20 years?
- After 20 years I need money.
What could these rags have been worth?
100 pounds.
Are you joking?
Do I look like I'm joking?
This troupe was never
The Illustrious Theater.
You were!
3 torn dresses... and 2 rusty breastplates.
That was enough for you then.
You'll have to wait.
We don't have the money now.
I'd like it as soon as possible, or else...
Or else?
I'll send for the bailiff.
For 100 pounds!
Want me to raise the price?
Take back your costumes.
I don't need them any more.
I give them back to you.
They're worn out.
After 20 years... haven't you got enough put away?
I'm insatiable, you know that.
You'll have to wait.
I have other worries at the moment.
I'm not waiting for anything.
By the authority of the Church we command all here, under threat of excommunication, to speak out now if you know of any impediment to this marriage about to be celebrated.
Lord, bless this coin as a token of the marriage settlement for the bride.
And to ensure that she is worth of it, endow her with divine wisdom.
Do you, Françoise Jeanne Marie, confess, acknowledge and swear before God in his Holy Church, to take for your lawfully wedded husband,
Henri Edmée Louis, here present?
As your father, I order you to say yes, madame!
Ô lord shed thy bounty on this woman, thy servant.
May she be, for her husband, as gentle as Rachel, as wise as Rebecca, as patient and faithful as Sarah.
What did you think of that bit of theater?
Will it inspire you as did those precious mannerisms of ours, that you ridiculed so cruelly?
Ladies, had I but known you...
God forbid!
You are so discerning you would have been even more cruel.
It's true that I strive to be impartial, to depict what I see, to say what I think.
That is very well said.
With our hearts, our minds and our souls we applaud you.
Here is the independent author who accepts the truth as the only limitation on his talent.
Therefore, monsieur, your fidelity to the truth obliges you to cast your eyes upon events of more gravity and more difficult to combat than our eccentricities.
Monsieur, let's be friends.
Join us in fighting fools and knaves.
School for Wives
Ballad for an old man newly wed, who can't fulfill his connubial duties.
Love
No longer is my master
No more his serf am I
Such is my disaster
Away from love I now must fly
Fleeing ever faster
To my resting place in the sky
Madame, I am old
Madame, I am old
Don't.
It's a lovely song.
At the dance my heart kept cadence
My feet were quick
As any maiden's
Now my heart can't stand the violence
It smells of trash here.
Shall we go?
Such small trash!
We're leaving.
I'm staying!
They haven't done anything to me.
Ever warm was I then
Ever seeking to quench my thirst
In that sweet fountain
I would soon be immersed
Now if the truth be told
Madame, I am cold
Madame, I am cold
Now my poor anatomy
Will not obey me
Like a relic
I am enshrined, once heroic
Now broken and melancholic
I retire to my bed
Madame, I am dead
Madame, I am dead
Thank you... for teaching me such a lovely song.
I've learned much about the hearts of men.
I saw your play tonight... most boring!
Instead of "School for Wives" wouldn't "School for Whores" be a more suitable title?
You laugh at the world crumbling, you scorn authority!
You mock liturgy, commandments, the Church!
But you will be a cuckold, too!
That's uncalled for, monsieur!
Let him get what he deserves!
I've waited ten years.
That's enough, monsieur!
How old is your wife?
After the mother, you had to have the daughter!
Don't waste your time, monsieur.
You're still in favor but the King forgets quickly!
I'm not going home right away.
Where are you going?
You know very well, Jean-Baptiste.
Get in with me!
No!
Not this evening.
Not in front of them.
Get in... you can get out one league from here.
Have his coach follow you.
Two years later, more serious trouble for Molière erupted in Monsieur Colbert's office.
That he is sacrilegious and abominable enough to write such a diabolical play hardly surprises me, for I know him.
But that the King allows it to be performed with its derision of the Church, its contempt for all that is sacred and divine.
The King should order it suppressed under pain of death.
All copies should be destroyed.
No trace of it should remain.
Thus the King would demonstrate the nobility of his heart and his respect for God and the Church.
Mother Church hopes that her eldest son will take this heroic and royal action.
She awaits this revenge against all the heresies, from which she has suffered in silence until today.
Exactly what is meant by
"until today"?
Nothing more than that, monsieur.
That reassures me.
I thought I detected the shadow of a threat, which surprised me very much.
Gentlemen, I bid you good day.
You haven't replied, monsieur.
Replied regarding what subject?
Regarding "Tartuffe".
You are most solitary, my lord.
And it is most extraordinary of you to renounce our sex.
At your age, you shun the gallantry which is the pride of your peers.
It is not so extraordinary.
Examples can be found not far from here.
And you cannot condemn my vow never to love without condemning your own sentiments.
There is a vast difference.
What befits one sex does not befit the other.
It is good for a woman to be insensitive and to preserve her heart from the flame of love.
But what is virtue in her becomes a crime in a man.
And since beauty is woman's proper estate... if you refuse your love you rob us all of our due homage.
You commit an offense that all women must resent.
I do not see why women who do not wish to love should take any interest in such offenses.
That is no excuse, my lord.
Even without wishing to love it is always pleasant to be loved.
That is no excuse, my lord.
Even without wishing to love it is always pleasant to be loved.
Say it again.
Again.
Even without wishing to love it is always pleasant to be loved.
That's well-said.
Go to the end of the scene.
La Grange, you step forward.
Madame, I have intruded upon your privacy.
I must respect your love of solitude.
Let me die! I can bear no more.
This unexpected blow has triumphed over my resolution.
The blow is surprising indeed.
I thought your stratagem had succeeded.
Next scene, as you walk out...
By what emotion unknown...
By what emotion unknown is my stricken heart now moved?
By what disturbing secret is my soul overcome?
Could it not be what has been said to me?
Without knowing it, could I be in love with this young prince?
I that were true, I would despair.
But it cannot be, I swear.
I know that I cannot love him.
Would I be capable of such cowardice?
I have had the world at my feet...
I have had the world at my feet and have remained completely indifferent.
The homage and respect failed to move me.
Now this proud disdain has conquered me.
I have spurned those who love me, could I now love the one who spurns me?
No, no, I do not love him.
No, I do not love him!
It cannot be.
But if what I feel is not love, what can it be?
And whence comes this poison...
And whence comes this poison that courses through my veins, not leaving me a moment's peace?
Out of my heart whoever you are!
Hidden enemy attack me openly!
Though you be the most fearsome of beasts,
I shall slay you and be done with you.
And be rid of you.
Now for Tartuffe.
I believe you are sincere, monsieur.
I'm convinced your play is not an attack on religion.
But that's what the spectators will think.
This is a time of religious foment.
There are Protestants, Jansenists,
Gallicans,
Bigots, the Papal party...
Too many factions for a country like ours.
These quarrels grow more violent each day.
Soon, if we let it go on, there won't be one truth, there will be many.
The King must not be exposed to such factionalism.
I know too well the power a play can exert.
I shall speak against you, to the King.
I cannot hide that from you.
I've kept you from your work on the King's festival.
I nearly forgot!
As of today you can hope to have your royal stipend doubled.
I'll appeal to the King.
For your stipend?
Consider it done.
For my play.
If the King...
You're going to make us lose our theater!
I don't care.
We do!
Can't we at least change the word
"Bigot"?
Bigot?
"Bigot".
Two beats.
Narrow, shallow, bellow, Boileau...
Say anything you like.
We have to cut from...
..."an admirable example and the lady is well-meaning..." at least to the line...
..."she has made good use of her advantages."
- Why?
- It describes the Queen.
Indeed it does.
This is maddening.
Cut the part about the Queen Mother.
As the scene is constructed,
I can't cut anything.
Make the end funny, win your foes over.
Soften Cléante's speech.
Those few lines won't make things worse.
They make me feel better.
Orgon says:
"I do not often see him at church."
Dorine replies:
"Must he attend at your hours
"like those who come only to be seen?"
- Cut that part.
- Why?
It describes the Court.
Indeed it does.
We haven't time to change everything!
I don't want to.
- Change the end.
- I don't want to!
Change nothing.
Put on a different play.
I don't want to!
Then we'll be banned.
Just change the end.
Add a scene for laughs.
Have Madame Pernelle come on stage.
Write her some funny lines.
She harangues the spectators, you leave them laughing.
The way it ends now you leave them deep in tragedy.
Is that what you wanted?
Yes.
Exactly.
But double the length.
- Where is the King?
- Down near the fountains.
- Candles keep going out.
- Put up torches.
It's starting to rain.
It won't rain on the King's festival!
I have a problem.
The elephant won't follow the camel in your procession.
It's disrupting the order.
Tell that elephant to stop being capricious.
Threaten him... flatter him!
Will it work?
I think so, but, above all, leave me in peace or I'll eat your elephant and you with it.
Where is the King?
He just passed on his way to the Music Court.
I beg Your Majesty to hear me out.
I designed this site for the music of the waters.
Not for Monsieur Lully's trumpets and cymbals.
I hear bad reports on your play.
I implore Your Majesty to judge for himself in this matter.
For it is certain, Sire, that I must forget about writing plays if the Tartuffes have the advantage.
They will persecute me more than ever and will find fault with my most innocent phrases.
I hear you.
Listen to the music of the waters proposed by my architect.
Monsieur Lully, kindly silence your trumpets and tympani.
Monsieur, my brother, what do you think?
Sire, I think...
I think, Sire, that a King favored by heaven and earth is the sole arbiter possible in this dispute between Nature and the Muses.
Then we shall favor the Muses.
We wish you and Monsieur Molière to collaborate on an entertainment as soon as possible.
And for my play, Sire, what may I expect?
Have no fear.
We admire your talent, monsieur.
Those men whose very souls know where their interest lies make of devotion both profession and merchandise.
They try to buy credit and dignity with false smiles and prating of divinity.
Those men, I saw, are to be seen ardently preaching each day eagerly pointing out heaven's way, yet somehow making their fortunes all the while.
Living in style, they continue to exhort others to flee the world while they remain at Court.
They know how to adjust their smiles and vices.
Vindictive and full of malice.
They have no faith except in artifice.
Here he comes!
Out, impure spirit!
Leave this creature of God.
Penetrate no further!
Damned spirit, enemy of the human race, attendant of death...
Take pity on a poor beggar, monsieur.
Alms for the love of God.
Instigator of hate, lying beast...
Beware of him who was sacrificed with Isaac, hanged with Joseph, put to death with the lamb, crucified as man...
Do you know why I gave you alms?
For the love of God.
Imbecile!
Withdraw before the power of
Our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead and the world, by God's fire.
Amen!
I have read the reports you sent me regarding the troubles beginning to take place in my provinces.
I shall be in Saint Germain on Monday and at the Finance Council meeting on Tuesday.
We shall see what action should be taken.
But, in advance...
I will tell you my thoughts.
We must not permit any activity against my authority to go unpunished.
How tall
How noble
This proud conqueror
His visage dazzles
None could be fairer
And though by his position
He already ranks high in grace
Something still more
Shines in his face
Versailles was being built and for the King's festiva/ the Republic of Venice sent some gifts.
It is only fitting that the music of the greatest King in the universe should be the greatest music in the world.
If Your Majesty so wishes he shall rule over music, as he does over this world.
Entrust me with this task and not one note, not one sound, not one voice will be raised in this empire that does not sing the glory of Louis.
I need austerity, not domestic society.
Our profession, our situation run counter to my deepest sentiments and to the mood I am in now.
What I seek is a certain philosophical detachment.
Everything keeps me from it, my wife, my troupe, the service of the King.
Too many friends have betrayed us...
Racine... Lully...
The King himself will soon abandon me to my fate.
I miss the Dufresnes.
And the strange death of Thérèse affected me.
La Grange,
I want to go away.
I want to leave you all.
You can run the theater.
Armande will help you.
If you need an author, there are plenty of them.
More than ever!
What do you say?
You must let me leave.
I'm old.
I'm old and I'm tired.
I have such a great need for solitude.
What are you thinking?
I was listening to you, monsieur.
And thinking George Dandin isn't drawing well any more.
We need a new play.
Yes, that's true.
I've started one about a miser.
I'll have to hurry and finish it.
May I see you for a minute?
Come close.
George Dandin isn't drawing well any more.
We need a new play.
Is your work going well?
How is your invalid doing?
I can't write anything.
I've dried up.
I'm empty.
I scribble, I scrawl...
I write gibberish.
By the end of Act I, I'm written out.
I can't get the scene between Toinette and the invalid.
Want to know the truth?
I'm a plagiarist.
I've never created anything.
Even if I were capable of it, everything stops me.
Constraints.
Lack of time.
I've stolen from Plautus, Terence,
Italians, Spaniards and Greeks.
And I'm stuck on a simple scene between a servant and her master.
You're in real trouble, my poor friend.
Why not use the same scene for Toinette and Argan as you did for Scapin and Argante?
Why not?
What would people say?
Don't worry about that.
I can't even remember it.
I can.
"I'm sure he won't do it."
Change "he" to "she" and you've got your scene.
- "I'll force her to!"
- "I say she won't do it."
"He'll do it or I'll disinherit him!"
No. Stop and think!
"She'll do it or...
I'll put her in a convent!"
"You?"
- "Me!"
- "Good!"
"What's good?"
We can cut out the "you, me etc..."
Why?
It's very good. That's what keeps the scene moving.
- Word for word?
- Word for word.
"You wouldn't put her in a convent!"
"I wouldn't put her in a convent?"
"That's ridiculous!"
"I wouldn't disinherit my..."
"I wouldn't put my daughter in a convent..."
"...if I want to?"
- You're adding that?
- Yes.
Good. "No, I say!"
- "Who'll stop me?"
- "Yourself!"
- "Me?"
- "You won't have the heart."
"I will."
"Paternal affection won't let you."
Change that to:
"Paternal affection will stop you."
"Paternal affection will stop you."
"It won't stop me!"
Now there...
You can improve on Scapin saying,
"Yes, yes."
You're shameless.
What will people say?
They'll laugh.
They won't notice anything.
You've tired me.
We had some good times together.
Yes.
Thank you.
See you tomorrow.
She left me alone, a poor invalid.
The bell isn't loud enough.
We're ready.
Let's go.
Curtain!
How was it?
Splendid.
I'm cold, I want to go home.
A doctor, quick!
He needs a doctor!
Tell me... where's Madeleine?
He's dying!
Faster! He's dying!
-- English --
After the conquest and plundering of the Inca empire by Spain...
...the Indians invented the legend of El Dorado...
...a land of gold, located in the swamps of the Amazon headwaters.
A large expedition of Spanish adventurers, led by Gonzalo Pizarro...
...set off from the Peruvian highlands in late 1560.
The only document to survive from this lost expedition...
...is the diary of the monk
Gaspar de Carvajal.
On Christmas day 1560, we reached the last pass of the Andes...
...and for the first time looked down at the legendary jungle.
In the morning I read mass, then we descended through the clouds.
AGUIRRE,
THE WRATH OF GOD
A film by
Werner Herzog
No one can get down that river alive!
I tell you, we can do it!
From here it will be easier.
No. We're all going to go under.
Our Indian slaves are useless.
The changing climate kills them off like flies...
...most of them die of colds.
We don't even have time to give them a Christian burial.
Come on, move it!
Move you pigs!
Come on! Let's go!
Keep moving, we don't want to get stuck in the mud!
Son of a bitch!
You idiots!
The sedan-chair will get stuck!
This way!
Damned mud!
Watch it, you idiots!
Keep the barrel out of the water!
By the last day of the year, we were exhausted.
We camped near the river.
It can't go on like this, men.
The rations are almost finished.
The terrain is so difficult, we're almost at a standstill.
We cannot hope to reach a populated area for some time.
In view of the situation we're in...
...I have changed my plans...
...as follows:
Rafts will be built and manned by forty men.
These men will have the task...
...to get food and information about hostile Indians...
...and the location of El Dorado.
We have every reason to believe that both are near...
The expedition must return within one week...
...by water or by land.
If it doesn't...
...we have to assume it is lost...
...and we have to march back the same way...
...in the hope of reaching an area inhabited by Christians.
We hope, of course, that this will not happen...
...as long as the Virgin Mary is with us.
After careful consideration,
I have decided...
...to make Don Pedro de Ursua commander of the expedition.
His mistress, Dona Inez de Atienza, will accompany him.
This happens against my better judgement.
But she expressed her wish with such grace and firmness...
...that I cannot refuse it.
Don Lope de Aguirre will be second in command.
A man who is well qualified for this task.
His daughter Flores will stay under his protection...
...this also is against my better judgement.
At fifteen, she should have stayed in the care of the Holy Sisters.
As on all expeditions, the word of
God must be brought to the pagans.
I hereby nominate Brother
Gaspar de Carvajal for this task.
The remaining two hundred slaves will stay with my group.
The Royal House of Spain will be represented...
...by the brave nobleman,
Don Fernando de Guzman...
...who proved his courage
10 years ago...
...at the storming of the fortress of Saxahuaman.
Some of the best warriors will form this group...
...but those not chosen shouldn't feel rejected.
I declare all this in the form of a document...
...to be submitted for approval to the Council of the Indies.
Herewith I append my signature.
Four days later, on January fourth, we set out.
May God be with us.
Watch the raft, the rapids get stronger!
Keep in the middle of the river!
- The first raft got stuck in an eddy!
- They must get away from the rocks!
January Sixth.
We finally reached shore and set up camp.
On the other side of the river, one of our rafts ran into an eddy.
We could not hear what they were yelling, and could not help.
How many are on the raft?
Seven and two Indians.
We must try to help the poor devils, Aguirre.
You are crazy!
We will not help them!
I'm still giving the orders.
Is that so...
We need long ropes and hooks.
Further downstream we can cross.
Once we're on the other side, we'll be able to get them out.
Take as many men as you need... and hurry!
I wonder if Armando has reached the other side?
Those men must be getting sick.
They're still going around in circles.
- What is this?
- They're firing over there.
They're trying to signal us.
Maybe it's a battle?
There are only six.
The oarsmen and the seventh man have gone.
I find that strange.
Look, the oars are still there.
I'm sure, there are still some Indians in this area.
We better go back to the camp.
Keep your eyes open!
Help!
Indians! Indians!
A prayer from here is not enough,
Brother Carvajal.
I want to take these men back for a Christian burial.
You are right, my son...
...their souls will rest much better in consecrated ground.
It's the least we can do for these poor guys who died so bravely.
Perucho!
Perucho, don't you think the cannon is getting a bit rusty?
Perhaps.
You know very well who is responsible.
If Aguirre gets away with this, who knows what he'll do next?
Don't worry about that.
We really have other problems.
There are Indians everywhere.
The whole area is full of them...
...and no one wants to die like the men on the raft.
If only we were out of this trouble...
We can't hope for that yet.
Don't be afraid.
Aguirre would never dare to rebel against the Spanish crown.
We are not in Castile, here.
Look what I've found for you.
This animal sleeps its whole life away.
It's never really awake.
Our rafts are gone.
The rafts are gone!
January Eighth.
The river rose fifteen feet over night.
When will our misfortunes end?
If I remove your chains, will you run away?
Would you?
Stop, wait a minute, isn't that my pot?
What are you doing with my pot?
No, the wood is too heavy.
We'll take this one. I'm not taking one step further into this jungle.
What's going on?
We're making nails.
What for?
We need as many nails as possible.
What are you doing with this log?
Well, I'm carrying it from where
I found it back to the camp.
Who gave that order?
Everyone here is collecting wood.
And iron.
What's going on here?
I have no idea.
Who gave the order to build rafts?
What does it all mean?
Do you know, Inez?
Don't even ask.
It's your father's fault.
If only it were all over.
Gentlemen, as your commander,
I have decided...
...to return to our main troop.
It's not my habit to retreat.
We have to march back, of course, because the current is too strong.
We need to get back within the time Pizarro ordered.
But that would be suicide because of the Indians.
Whatever the cost, we have to march back.
We must get back to Pizarro!
Shit on Pizarro!
I say, we can't accomplish our task this way.
And I say, we can conquer without Pizarro!
That's what we gathered logs and iron for...
...to build a raft.
Do you remember Hernando Cortez?
Bound for Mexico, he was ordered to return...
...but he just went on!
Silence, Aguirre!
He ignored the orders and conquered Mexico!
Silence, everyone!
That's how he became rich and famous...
Be quiet!
Because he disobeyed!
Put him in chains!
Stop it, now!
- I follow Ursua.
- Kill him!
Anyone else?
What do you think will happen now?
What if there are waterfalls downstream?
Who cares, as long as we get closer to El Dorado.
Have you seen Ursua clenching his fist?
He must have something in it.
I think, they will kill him.
Would you have the courage to help him?
You're the only one who can help us.
I know he will kill Ursua and Armando.
He will finish what he has started.
You are my last hope.
Thou lettest man flow on like a river...
...and Thy years know no end.
As for man...
...his days are like grass...
...as a flower on the field, so he blossoms.
For when the wind passeth over it...
...and it is gone, and the place thereof shall know it no more.
You know, my child...
...for the good of our Lord...
...the Church was always on the side of the strong.
I would like to have you on our side.
We need men like you.
You should think about it...
...but not too long.
Well, gentlemen...
...we've gotten rid of the troublemakers.
Now we need a leader.
For me, the choice is clear.
We should elect the biggest and strongest nobleman we have.
- What me?
- Yes... you.
Well, gentlemen.
I am making a proposal to elect Guzmán.
Who else is for him?
I propose that Don Lope de Aguirre remains second-in-command!
Who's in favor?
Plagues have come over my people, earthquakes and floods...
...but what the Spaniards did to us...
...is much, much worse.
They gave me the name Balthasar, but my real name is Runo Rimac.
- What does that mean?
- Runo Rimac.
It means: He who speaks.
I was a prince in this land.
No one was allowed to look directly into my eyes.
But now I'm in chains, like my people...
...and I must bow my head.
Almost everything was taken from us.
I can't do anything, I'm powerless.
But I am also sorry for you...
...because I know there is no escape from this jungle.
How is Ursua?
Because of our mutiny, we must make our position legal.
Read this document.
Caesarian King, by the grace of God, through our Holy Mother...
...the Roman Church,
Philip the Second of Castile.
We, the undersigned, have until yesterday...
...the seventh day of 1561
...regarded ourselves as your servants and subjects.
We are now more than 200 miles from your servant, Gonzalo Pizarro.
Fate, God's help and the work of our hands have carried us down a river.
A river, the natives call Huallaga, in search of a new land of gold.
We have decided to put an end to the quirks of fate.
We are forging history, and no fruits of this earth shall henceforth be shared.
We rebel until death.
Our hands shall perish and our tongues dry up if this is not so.
The House of Habsburg is overthrown.
And you, Philip the Second, are dethroned.
By dint of this declaration, be you annihilated.
In your place we proclaim...
...the nobleman from Sevilla,
Don Fernando de Guzmán...
...as Emperor of El Dorado.
Flee from hence, O King!
And may God bless your soul.
Fortune smiles on the brave and spits on the coward.
Let's sever our ties with Spain and crown Don Fernando de Guzmán...
...Emperor of El Dorado.
Do you call this a throne?
What is a throne, but a plank covered with velvet, Your Majesty.
He must have dragged himself along.
That's no arrow wound, that was a sword thrust.
He must have tried to stop him.
January Tenth.
Armando escaped from his prison.
The man who went on guard at three o'clock was murdered.
It was one of his men.
While Ursua is alive...
...you'll never be safe!
What can I do about it?
Kill him.
While I'm Emperor, law will prevail.
No killings without a trial.
Then try him... and then kill him!
But it must me a public trial.
He still has sympathizers.
Perucho, to the witness stand.
What did you get out of Ursua?
Nothing.
Three men couldn't open his fist.
He must have something in it.
We'd have to chop his hand off to get at it.
He said nothing, except some nonsense.
But last night he had visitors.
The whole story reeks of conspiracy.
Balthasar, ask him if it's true that he received money from Ursua.
Yes, it's true.
It was the oarsmen's pay.
Next witness!
Okello, is it true that you also received money from Ursua?
I was Pizarro's slave. Then he gave me away for this expedition...
...because he thought, if the Indians are scared of a horse...
...they'd be terrified of a black man.
Well, I don't know why, but sometimes Ursua gave me money.
What does the defendant have to say?
I want to speak.
In Spain I had many servants, and I paid them.
It is only fair to give them money here as well...
...even if they are Indians.
Time will tell that Ursua is right.
We understand your confusion, my child. You are excused.
The jury, after having heard all testimonies...
...finds the defendant...
...guilty of treason.
My unpleasant duty...
...as President of the first court of your Highness, Don Fernando...
...is to sentence Pedro de Ursua...
...to death by hanging.
I confirm the verdict.
But since it is the anniversary of the last Moor leaving Spain...
...I will grant clemency.
His life will be spared, but he forfeits...
...all rights as a citizen of El Dorado.
Half of his shares will go to the Church...
...the other half will be divided among my best soldiers.
January Twelfth.
In the morning we set out with a new raft.
Ursua is still alive...
...but he refuses to speak.
Look, a fire!
At noon we saw a great fire.
Steer closer to the shore!
Load your muskets.
I can't see anyone.
Be careful, men!
It could be an ambush.
Strip the negro, go on!
Fearing an ambush, we stripped the negro slave, to frighten the Indians.
Go! Run!
Go on! Go, I said!
Drive him in front of us!
Get away from the food!
Look out for Indians!
Are you crazy?
Take your weapons!
Look at that. It was one of our men.
Where does this come from?
And this here?
For heaven's sake, cannibals!
The discovery of cannibals around us was so disturbing...
...that we hastily left this dreadful place.
January twentieth.
The mountains are now behind us and the land is flat.
The roof Aguirre had us build, protects us against the scorching sun.
The river is sluggish and we're slowly coming to a halt.
What's this?
Are you giving him a gun?
Aguirre, I know that you plan on doing something to Ursua!
There's no doubt in my mind.
And God will punish you for that!
Get out of my way!
Are you alright, little one?
What's happening?
You can't hear a thing.
It's suddenly so quiet.
Yes, not a sound.
Shh... so, we can hear...
The gunpowder! It's on fire!
Out of the way! It's going to blow up!
Grab the pole!
Help me pull the Emperor onto the raft!
Here, so he can hold on to it.
Damned horse...
...nothing but trouble!
What's wrong with him?
He's dead.
Look how short the arrow is.
Poisoned.
It must belong to a dwarf.
- Fire! Make some noise, quickly!
- What are we to aim at?
Just shoot, you asshole!
Fire!
Fire!
Come, play something for the men.
- Look, isn't that a canoe?
- Where?
Over there under those trees, it's coming towards us.
Keep the raft mid-stream.
It could be a trap.
January twenty fourth.
For the first time, we saw two of the savages.
They seemed to be trusting.
Pull the boat close.
I have the man. Hold him!
And I have the woman.
Look, there's a fish!
What did he say?
He says...
...he's from the Yagua Tribe.
He knows from his ancestors that one day, the Sons of the Sun...
...would arrive from afar, through great perils.
The strangers would come with thunder from tubes.
They've waited a long time for the coming of the Sons of the Sun.
For here on this river,
God never finished His Creation.
Look, gold!
Where did you get that?
Gold!
Gold! Ask him where he got it from.
Ask him where El Dorado is.
Where does this gold come from?
What did he say?
Has this savage ever heard of our savior Jesus Christ...
...and of our mission and the True Word of God?
This is a Bible.
It contains the Word of God...
...that we preach to bring light into the darkness of their world.
Does he understand at all, that this book contains the Word of God?
Take it in your hand, my son.
- He says, it doesn't talk.
- Kill him for this blasphemy!
It is a tough business.
These savages are hard to convert.
It won't be much longer.
El Dorado might be only a few days away.
No more rust on the cannon.
We will shoot our enemies with golden bullets.
And you, Okello, will serve my food on golden platters.
And all of us will gain something.
Governships...
...provinces...
...and women.
And perhaps I'll even be free.
Let's not forget the most important part of our mission...
...to spread the Word of God to the savages.
I'm sure you'd like a golden cross studded with jewels, Carvajal...
...instead of the silver one you lost.
All the land to our left and all the land to our right...
...now belongs to us.
I solemnly and formally take possession of all this land.
Our country is already six times larger than Spain...
...and every day we drift, makes it bigger.
Have you seen any solid ground that would support your weight?
Okello, it's missing salt!
Fish and fruit we can find now and then...
...but we've been out of salt for a while.
We're down to counting our last grains of corn.
- Hold the horse!
- The horse has cut loose!
- Take the reins!
- Watch out!
Watch, that it doesn't jump off board!
Damn, get that horse away from me!
Get rid of it!
Throw that damned beast off the raft!
Go on!
Go for a swim!
- It wants to get back on board.
- Go away!
I think he's a dead man.
In Mexico, I saw an army of Indians flee at the sight of one single horse.
And besides, we could have eaten meat for a week...
Don't worry, little one, the horse will be alright.
Oh, my God, the Emperor!
The Emperor is dead!
After our Emperor's death, the fate of Ursua was sealed.
Next morning, a few soldiers took him away and he never came back.
Little mother,
...two by two...
...wafts the wind on my hair.
What are they shouting?
They're shouting,
"Meat is floating by."
Fire!
Set the village on fire!
Keep shooting, it'll scare them!
Don't go into the jungle!
Salt!
Salt!
I haven't had salt for a month!
She has gone without a trace.
We couldn't find her anywhere.
We have not seen any Indians either.
Let's march back to Pizarro.
Two men, more or less, it won't matter to him.
I am sick of it. I'm leaving tonight.
If I march at night, the Indians won't catch me.
In the day, I will hide.
I will get back to Pizarro.
We followed her tracks half a mile into the jungle, then we lost them.
She simply vanished!
Then one of the men panicked because of the silence...
...which always comes just before someone gets killed.
I'd rather join the Indians, than stay with this madman.
That man is a head taller than me.
That may change...
I'll explain my plan.
I have counted the river bends.
I've drawn a map in the sand.
We need about a day for each bend.
One, two...
...three, four, five...
...six, seven...
...eight...
...nine...
...ten.
I am the great traitor.
There can be no greater!
Whoever even thinks about deserting will be cut into 198 pieces!
And then trampled upon until you can paint the walls with him.
Whoever eats one grain too many...
...or drinks one drop of water too much...
...will be locked up for 155 years!
If I, Aguirre, want the birds to drop dead from the trees...
...the birds will drop dead from the trees.
I am the Wrath of God!
The earth I walk upon sees me and quakes!
But whoever follows me and the river, will win untold riches.
But whoever deserts...
Get away from the tree!
Go to mid-stream!
- Hey, give me a pole!
- Watch out, the roof!
Watch out, the sedan-chair is falling!
Careful!
Over there.
The long arrows are getting fashionable...
- Indians!
- Where? I don't see any.
- Make noise!
- I better get out of here.
February first.
The men's morale is at a low point.
I spoke with Aguirre.
Things are not turning out as we expected.
We see nothing but hunger and death.
We lose men, but we never see the enemy.
Even El Dorado hasn't been more than an illusion.
Mexico was no illusion!
If we turn back now, others will come.
And they will succeed!
And we'll remain a failure!
Even if this land only consists of trees and water...
...we will conquer it!
And it'll be milked dry by those who follow us.
My men measure riches in gold.
It is more.
It is power and fame.
I despise them for it.
I am sure, Aguirre is leading us into destruction.
I almost feel, he does it deliberately.
We can't even get ashore, since the river flooded the jungle for miles.
February twenty-second.
The suffering is dreadful.
Most men have fever and hallucinations.
Hardly anyone can stand upright.
The soldier Justo Gonzales drank my ink, thinking it was medicine.
I can no longer write.
We are drifting in circles.
I see a ship with sails...
...in a tall tree...
...and from the stern hangs a canoe.
The ship is in your imagination.
No floodwaters could rise this high.
We all have the fever.
It is only a mirage.
These things happen when people are overly exhausted.
Shut up, monk!
We'll get that ship! It is real!
We'll sail to the Atlantic with it.
No, Lope de Aguirre, I won't go with you. We are weak and hungry.
That is no ship. That is no forest.
That is no arrow.
We just imagine the arrows, because we fear them.
These arrows are real, take cover!
This arrow can't harm me.
This is not rain.
Monk, do not forget to pray, lest God's end...
...will be uncomely.
When we reach the sea...
...we will build a bigger ship...
...sail north and take Trinidad from the Spanish crown.
From there we'll sail on...
...and take Mexico from Cortez.
What great treachery this will be!
Then, all of New Spain will be in our hands...
...and we'll stage history...
...like others stage plays.
I, the Wrath of God...
...will marry my own daughter...
...and with her I will found the purest dynasty...
...the earth has ever seen.
Together...
...we shall rule this entire continent.
We will endure.
I am the Wrath of God!
Who else is with me?
Hello. I'm Orson Welles.
Lovely, isn't it?
The summer palace of Louis XVI.
Historians have recently discovered an unknown fact concerning this palace.
An event which almost changed the entire history of Western Europe.
Did you know that the entire French
Revolution could have been avoided?
It's true.
No one knows what took place there.
It's an event of such importance that men of integrity...
...and of considerable resources have made a film on the subject.
It's a color film, which I am not in.
Now, where was I?
Oh, yes, yes. It began far, far away from this lovely palace...
...in the middle of the 18th century.
A coach and four thunder through
the night across the French countryside...
... carrying the Corsican Count de Sisi...
... rushing his pregnant wife
to the court doctors in Paris.
We'll never reach Paris in time.
We'll stop at the first village.
Faster! Faster!
Now, come along, my dear.
Don't worry. I'm sure he's a good doctor.
Oh, he'll have delivered hundreds of babies.
I'm the Duke de Sisi.
My wife requires immediate attention.
- What's wrong with her?
- She's cut her finger, you imbecile.
Go and get the doctor!
Get the doctor, you idiot.
Come on, my dear.
It won't be long now. The doctor's coming.
The doctor's attending to my wife.
You'll have to wait your turn.
How dare you speak to me like that!
Do you know who I am?
Oh, yes. The Duke de Sisi.
The scrounge of Corsica.
Scourge of Corsica, you ignorant peasant.
- Oh, pretty clothes.
- Girl, go and fetch the doctor.
At once!
Not until my wife's had her baby.
Unless, of course, you want half a pound of copper pellets.
Stand aside, peasant, or you'll feel 3 feet of cold steel.
Move any closer, you get
10 inches of forged iron.
Not before you get
2 ounces of molten lead.
Unless, of course,
I give you 3 feet of Persian rug.
- All right, now, who has the cut finger?
- Cut finger?
- My wife's going to have a baby.
- Never mind. What about my wife?
Stop bickering! Another delivery!
Anne, we shall have to use my bedroom.
- Which one's the duke?
- Who do you think?
- Oh, you have a son.
- A son?
A son to keep peasants like you in their place.
Monsieur Coupe, you, too, have a son.
A son. A son. A son for France, for freedom, for liberty.
- A son to fight your son.
- Pa, Pa.
- Come quick! Another baby!
- Another one?!
Now, let's bring them their babies.
- I'll take the Coupes'.
- Good.
- I don't think those are the Coupes'.
- Yes. Those are the de Sisi babies.
- Didn't you keep track?
- I thought you did.
- You fool. You dreadful...
- You know I can't. I don't like looking.
- Quiet! Quiet!
- I don't like looking at them.
Look, I'll tell you what we'll do.
Here, hold this.
Now, at least we'll be half-right.
Come on.
Little did the doctor know what he
had done by mismatching these babies.
France would never be the same.
- My sons.
- And my sons.
Paris, France, 1789.
Thirty years later,
under the rule of Louis XVI...
... longstanding grievances
between aristocrat and peasant...
... were about to boil over.
The pot in which these troubles boiled...
... was kindled by the firewood
of oppression and injustice...
... and heated by flames that sucked
the air from gasping peasants.
Would the pot cool off?
Would it merely simmer, or would it
boil over in the kitchen of France...
... to stain the floor of history forever?
Paris, France, 1789.
Thirty years later,
under the rule of Louis XVI...
... grievances between aristocrat
and peasant were about to boil over...
In Paris, outraged rebels roused
themselves to attack the king's convoys.
Most of these aroused rebels were brave,
courageous, freedom-loving citizens.
Others were more realistic.
Our paths cross those of the
mismatched twins, one noble, one peasant...
... born on that rainy night 30 years ago.
Claude and Charles Coupe,
orphaned in youth, living by their wits.
They were dragooned into
the cause of the rebels.
Lovers of liberty,
they knew no liberty.
Well, how you been?
Not bad, not bad.
- How is everything with you, Jacques?
- Not bad.
Not bad.
- A bit rough out there, wasn't it?
- It was a bit rough. It was a bit rough.
- Wasn't it, Charlie?
- Yes, very rough.
Especially in the rear.
We were all alone back there.
Yes, I know. Too bad I wasn't there to help you, but I was up in the front.
- I see they got you in the leg.
- Yes.
- In the arm?
- Yes.
- In the head?
- Yes.
- You would do it again, wouldn't you?
- Oh, yes.
I bet you would!
Traitors.
Out of the way.
You're a disgrace to your fathers, both of you!
Deserting the fight for liberty.
Attacking the king's pillow makers, you call that a fight for liberty?
The convoy was to contain arms.
We take what we can get.
- How many pillows did we get?
- Five hundred and forty.
But we lost 10 men, Jacques.
They died so that one day
Frenchmen will sleep in peace.
- Pass out pillows.
- Pass out pillows.
- And tell them to get some rest.
- Get some rest.
- Out of my way!
- Get out of here!
Corsica, house of de Sisi, 1789.
The legendary Corsican brothers.
The other pair mismatched
in birth 30 years before.
Raised in luxury, trained in
the tradition of superiority...
... and the domination of nobility.
- Lagging behind again?
- I'm sorry, Philippe.
- I try my best to please you.
- How?
You can't hunt, you can't ride, you can't shoot, you can't fence.
- What kind of a marriage is this?
- What kind indeed?
You pay more attention to Thor than you do to me.
Wonder why? He's served me far better than you.
But he is dead.
- What?
- Nothing.
I didn't hear. What did you say?
Repeat what you said. I didn't hear.
- I said nothing...
- What?
- Nothing at all, Philippe.
- Philippe!
- I'm sorry. She's an idiot.
- Philippe!
- Philippe! Philippe!
- What are you doing, Philippe?
What does it look like?
I'm feeding my falcon.
- Pierre is calling.
- I don't care. I'm not a puppet.
- Come at once.
- But it must be important.
Pierre is so rarely excited.
More excited than I?
Are you saying that he gets more excited than I?
- He gets more excited than I?
- Of course not.
My brother gets more excited than I do?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
- You want to see excitement?
- No!
I'll show you excitement if that's what you want to see!
Oh, no, Philippe, you're more excited than he is.
Far better than Pierre.
Better-looking, a better horseman, everything.
I like you, Philippe.
I like you very much indeed.
Thank you. You know, it's always good when we can talk these things out.
I'll join you in the chapel later.
- Very well, Philippe.
- Bring the rawhide and honey.
The king's summer palace, 1789.
King Louis, whose tinkering with timepieces
did not tell him his own time was running out.
Queen Marie tinkered with
everything but timepieces.
She didn't care what time it was.
But the evil Escargot
knew what time it was.
His tinkering was well-timed.
For the time was...
... 1789.
- What?
- I'm the courier, Lt. Sorel.
- Prove it.
- My papers, Your Majesty.
- Do you know who I am?
- But you are...
The king.
See?
Terrible times these are.
No one can be trusted.
You are to take this letter...
You are to take this letter to the brothers de Sisi in Corsica.
- Yes, sire.
- Your boat leaves at midnight.
- Have you a timepiece?
- Well, no, sire.
Well, take one of mine.
- You promise you'll give it to me back?
- Of course, Your Majesty.
No, you don't. You're not to be trusted.
Ask anybody when it's midnight.
Somebody will tell you.
Very well, sire.
No one must know of your journey.
The fate of France depends on that piece of paper.
- Here is the letter.
- Good.
It appears that your feeble-minded husband intends to betray us, Marie.
Betrayed by Louis? My darling Escargot, he has the brains of a chicken.
Brains enough to summon the de Sisis, my love.
The de Sisis?
The brains of a chicken, coupled with the claws of two eagles...
...may well hatch the eggs of our destruction.
Yes.
- He must know our plan.
- And we shall know his.
I shall deliver this note to the de Sisis myself...
...and in turn, deliver the de Sisis to us.
- Excellent.
Make haste, Escargot.
- I go with God.
- Go with whomever you please...
...just take your horse.
Corsica, still 1789.
A few days later, Philippe de Sisi,
summoned by his brother, Pierre...
... returned home on urgent business.
Happy? I've broken my bird.
Allow me to introduce my brother,
Philippe. The Duke d'Escargot.
Who?
The Duke d'Escargot.
Why has he come to see me?
I was having fun.
He has come to see both of us.
King Louis says he needs us.
Needs us? Needs us for what?
He doesn't even know us.
But he knew your father and the honor of the de Sisis.
Your swords are famous throughout France.
What proof has he?
A letter from Louis written in his own hand.
Proof enough?
Give me that.
- I see your name came first.
- You going to start that again?
Your name is first on the gate, mine on the carriage.
Your name is first on the sheets, mine on the blankets. Enough.
Should you do as I instruct, both your names shall shape the fate of France.
- What's he saying?
- He wants us to betray the king...
...and align ourselves with him.
- He has a plan only you can uncover.
And what is the reward for this treachery?
Half of France.
- And for my brother?
- Philippe.
The agreement is signed and guaranteed by Marie Antoinette and myself.
Just as I suspected.
I'll have no part of this.
What's wrong?
Just put his name first.
Very well.
But we must not arouse Louis' suspicion.
You must proceed to Paris in disguise, as he instructed in his letter.
Philippe, we must proceed to Paris in disguise, as per Louis' instructions.
- What will be his disguise?
- What will be your disguise?
I will be dressed as Escargot.
- He will be dressed as Escargot.
- Who?
- Escargot.
- Gentlemen, are we agreed?
- Agreed?
- No, we are not agreed.
- What will be his disguise?
- He is Escargot.
- Gentlemen, are we agreed?
- Agreed?
- I'll think about it.
- Agreed.
- Well, gentlemen...
- I say farewell.
Farewell.
Farewell.
I like this plan.
Half of France will soon be ours.
Why settle for half when all of France can be ours?
All of France?
- Yes. We don't need Escargot.
- Exactly.
Exactly.
- All the castles.
- All the chapels.
- All the windows.
- All the drapes.
- All the leather.
- All the lace.
- All the forests.
- All the flowers.
- All the land!
- All the grass.
- The rocks!
- The stones.
- The pebbles!
- The dirt.
- The mud!
- The mud.
I have a new destiny!
- One day, I shall be king!
- And I shall be queen.
How dare she enjoy herself while I must mingle with these swine.
Fool, we have no choice if we are to arrive secretly, as Louis ordered.
Do you think I like dressing like scum?
Wait till I get her back in that chapel.
I'll bring out the peacock feathers.
That'll tickle her fancy.
A back street of Paris, 1789.
Disguised as common rebel,
a clever spy sought out his fellow rebels.
Carrying vital information,
he headed for a secret meeting place.
Confident he was not followed,
the blind man discarded his disguise.
But was he a blind man?
Yes, he was.
- Jacques. Where's Jacques?
- He's over there.
Over there? Where?
Jacques? Jacques? No...
- Over here, Blind Man!
- Where?
- Jacques?
- Over here.
Jacques. Jacques. Jacques.
Get your hands off me!
What do you want, Blind Man?
I've got some news.
There's a barge arriving at the docks tomorrow, loaded with arms and ammunition.
It's the arms we need for the revolution.
You have done well, Blind Man.
Here, have some chicken.
Oh, thank you, Jacques.
- Marcel.
- Jacques.
- Get all the men together again.
- But you just told them to rest.
I don't care! Cancel it.
Get them all here together again.
Right. All of you, quick, around Jacques. Everybody!
The blind man just informed me a barge arrives tomorrow...
...with arms and ammunition we need for the revolution. I got a plan.
It's a very simple plan.
We need two volunteers.
You two will act as our diversion.
The real attack will begin when the guards are killing you.
Wait! I have a better idea!
I have an even better idea.
What's going on? I've got a better idea.
Mimi's father's French farmhouse, 1789.
On the outskirts of Paris...
...the rebels stopped to pick up their meager supply of arms to attack the river barge.
This also afforded Claude Coupe an opportunity to bid a reluctant adieu...
... to his fiancée, Mimi Montage.
- No! No! No, don't leave me!
- Do you think I want to leave you?
- No! Kiss me! Kiss me!
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Let him kiss her. Let him kiss her!
- Can't I have a moment with her alone?
- Go ahead and kiss her. We won't look!
Oh, Claude, don't leave me!
- I can't live without you.
- I can't live without you.
- Won't you send someone else?
- Yes, someone else.
No, you were chosen.
No! Don't take him away from me!
I can't live without him!
I love him! I love him!
Jacques.
The girl was hysterical.
Somebody had to silence her.
What are they laughing at?
Get them out of there!
Get them out of there! Get them!
On to the river!
- Claude! Claude!
- Mimi! Mimi!
- I love you!
- Mimi.
- Come back!
- Mimi.
- Claude!
- Mimi!
- Claude, I love you.
- I love you, Mimi.
- I love you.
- Mimi. Mimi.
- I love you, Mimi.
- Don't leave me!
- Please don't leave me!
- I don't want to!
- I can't say goodbye!
- Please say goodbye. You're hurting me!
Goodbye, Mimi.
Goodbye.
- Your turn.
- Don't do that.
- You're insulting our friend.
- Don't do that!
What's the matter?
Too good to drink with us?
Philippe, drink it.
For France, drink it.
God, that's good!
Give some to my brother.
- You.
- No, no, I can't drink. Liver trouble.
You.
Clever, aren't you?
I could kill you for that!
- Then, why don't you?
- Because...
...I'm sick!
Now, get ready.
There's the barge the king said they'll be on.
If they're dressed like peasants, how will we know them?
I told you, one of them will be carrying a violin case.
- Which one?
- What difference does it make?
Just look for a violin.
When the barge docks, attack one of the soldiers.
Oh, and put up a good fight.
If that's possible for you two.
Let's pick the weakest one and get this thing over with.
Well, good luck, Claude.
Let's get out of here!
In here, Charlie.
For France! For liberty, equality!
Watch out, peasant.
Swine!
Swine, huh?
- The rest of those rifles!
- Here, this way.
Oh, no!
- I don't believe it.
- He's mad.
- What did you do that for?
- It must be worth a fortune. We can sell it.
- Is that your violin?
- No. You see, actually...
- Yes, certainly. Of course it is.
- Quick, get in the carriage.
- I said, in the carriage.
- All right.
- Get in.
- Into the carriage.
Let's go.
Wonder whose violin this is.
Just remember, we found it.
We didn't steal it.
Your quarters are up here.
The king will see you this evening.
- Holy, hey, you stole the king's violin.
- I knew it was a good one, Claude.
Welcome, gentlemen.
- Hello.
- Gentlemen, I must compliment you...
...on your appearance.
So charmingly obscene, so vile...
...so filthy, so disgusting.
- Thank you.
You've achieved a rare vulgarity in peasantry.
Are you from the king?
No need for the charade.
No one can hear us. Now...
Oh, well, then, will you please tell the king that we're very sorry for what we did?
We're very sorry for what we did, and we beg his forgiveness.
- Beg his forgiveness?
- It was a misunderstanding...
What?
I warn you, gentlemen,
I am not to be trifled with.
To pull the tail of a lion is to open the mouth of trouble...
...and reveal the teeth of vengeance biting the tongue of deceit.
I didn't like that.
Well, he certainly didn't care about the violin.
Oh, did you get that?
Good. That's good.
- Are we in it?
- What's the matter, Claude?
What's the matter?
They think we're somebody else.
Know whose tail he was talking about biting with that lion's mouth? That was our tail!
- Who could we be?
- I don't know.
- Well, keep trying. You'll get it.
- Well, how would I know who we are?
Whoever we are, we don't play the violin.
- What's that?
- A note.
- Who is it to?
- Philippe and Pierre de Sisi.
- Who?
- Philippe and Pierre de Sisi.
- Do you know who they are?
- Yes.
- Who?
- The Corsican brothers.
- Do you know what he thinks?
- Yes.
- What?
- That we're the Corsican brothers.
That's right.
Come on, off your ass!
Greetings from Corsica.
As they say in Corsica...
...goodbye.
Jacques. Jacques. Jacques.
Here's two more, Jacques.
- Check them, you idiot.
- Idiot, check.
Check them. They are checking them.
The idiot's checking them.
Well, how are you getting along?
- You fought well, men. I'm proud of you.
- Where are we?
Don't worry. You're safe.
So you're the king's men.
Tell Louis we are here.
What?
Tell the king the de Sisis have arrived.
Where are they?
Show them to me. Point them out.
- You're insane. Where's the violin case?
- The what?
- Get the violin case!
- What are you talking about?
Do as you're told, man!
- Marcel! Marcel!
- Check.
He's crazy! Court-martial him.
Shoot him at dawn!
- Dawn?
- No, cancel it. Shoot him now.
- Crazy?
- Yes.
- Are you saying I'm crazy?
- Lock him up.
I, crazy? Is that what you're saying?
That I'm crazy?
Would you like to see crazy?
I'll show you crazy.
Jacques. Jacques, hold him.
Hold him, Jacques. He's mad!
- I'll show you crazy if you want to see crazy!
- Jacques, Jacques.
Give me the stick.
Blind Man, give me the stick.
What's going on, Jacques?
Here, Jacques. Jacques. Jacques, here.
Can I have some chicken?
Here, eat that!
Oh, I'll charge that.
I hope that pleases Your Grace.
- Yes, it's acceptable.
- No, I won't do it.
- I said, I won't do it. I won't do it.
- Having trouble, brother?
Don't you understand French?
I'm not wearing this to the ball tonight!
Leave that. Just leave that.
- Put it down.
- Brother, dear, do be gracious.
We're not in Corsica.
I don't "car." Care? Care?
- Care.
- Care where we are.
I don't think this is suitable for the occasion.
But it's only your dressing gown, Your Grace.
You needn't wear it to the ball.
I was just going to...
My dressing gown.
Well, I know it's my dressing gown.
I was merely testing your knowledge of clothes.
- What's this?
- A glove.
Excellent. That's excellent.
Now get out. Leave us.
Be gone with yourself.
And himself too.
- Yes, Your Grace.
- Better do as he says.
He's difficult to manage till he's had his hair done.
I think you've done my hair terribly well.
Thank you.
We can fool servants, but what are we gonna do at that ball?
If you believe you're a de Sisi, they'll believe you're a de Sisi.
If I believe, I'm gonna get my head chopped off...
I said, we do not wish to be disturbed! Out!
What was I just talking about?
I told you thrice...
...we do not want to be disturbed!
I don't think you understand.
- I am the king.
- You're the what?
I am, really. You see, it...
There, it's on my ring.
Your Majesty.
Oh, that's nice.
Nobody does that to me anymore.
Now, are we alone?
Yes.
Please sit down.
Now, I'll explain to you why I sent for you...
...if you promise not to tell anyone but yourselves.
Yes, yes.
Tonight, I have to announce a marriage...
...between Christina of Belgium and Escargot.
You know what that means?
Yes, a marriage.
More than a marriage, a military alliance.
Between them,
Escargot and Marie, that's my wife...
...with those Belgian troops, plan to rule France.
Yes! That's exactly as I suspected.
Isn't it, dear brother?
The very plan you mentioned, yes.
- So you probably guessed my plan.
- Of course!
We'll return to Corsica, marshal our forces and meet you later.
Come, there's not a moment to lose.
No! No, no!
You... No, you will marry Christina.
And then you will have the Belgian army, and I can rule France.
But you already rule France.
Well, that's what they say, but it isn't true.
Now, I have it all worked out.
You will kill Escargot.
Excuse me, Your Majesty, isn't Escargot the greatest swordsman in all France?
Oh, maybe, but you are the greatest swordsmen in Corsica.
Yes, yes, how soon we forget.
No one must know I've been here.
I'll meet you at the ball tonight.
Marquis and Marquise Maduce.
His Excellency, the Count Henri Manzini.
General and Madame Marceau.
The Count and Countess Jacquard.
The Dukes Philippe and Pierre de Sisi...
...the Corsican brothers.
We're going to die, you know.
He was the one in the bedroom.
Welcome to Paris.
I am the Duke d'Escargot.
An honor, sir.
What brings you to Paris?
Oh, you might say, a little business.
And a little pleasure.
Which do you prefer, business or pleasure?
Well, that depends on what you regard as business.
And what you may regard as pleasure.
In Paris, we say business is pleasure.
And to us, pleasure is our business.
Your business should be a pleasure, making my pleasure a business.
Unless some mistake business for pleasure while others know no business but pleasure.
In that case, sir, I will show you my business.
My pleasure.
Her Grace...
...the Duchess Helene de Sisi.
I spare you for the sake of your wife.
His Grace, the Count Jatruce.
Are we in it?
What do you mean "we"?
She's your wife.
Their Highnesses, the Prince and Princess Vinitari.
Philippe, Pierre.
One false step and you die.
Back out of the room slowly.
I've only just got here!
What have I done wrong now?
Their Royal Majesties, the King and Queen of France.
You said it was a costume ball!
I changed my mind.
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought it was a costume ball.
But I thought it was a costume ball.
I thought it was...
Your Majesties, may I present Philippe and Pierre de Sisi, Madame de Sisi.
Their Majesties, the King and Queen of France.
I thought it was a costume ball.
Her Serene Highness,
Princess Christina of Belgium.
Louis, make the announcement.
Oh, yes, of course.
I have an announcement.
We have the honor to announce a marriage will be arranged...
...between Christina of Belgium and the Duke d'Escargot.
- She's beautiful. I like the king's plan.
- What are you talking about?
She'll never marry Escargot.
It will be a pleasure killing that swine!
You've forgotten who you are?
You'd be lucky to run the girl through.
Oh, yeah.
Your Majesties, may I present Christina of Belgium.
The King and Queen of France.
Get up, Louis. Christina is here.
I thought it was a costume ball.
Our other guests
Philippe and Pierre de Sisi.
I am at your service.
It's an honor.
You are well-known in my country.
And you're well-known in your country.
- I suppose I am.
- The dance, Louis.
Come, Christina.
Why didn't you expose me?
I know your tastes, Philippe, but this is hardly the place for that.
I must see you later.
Me?
In my chambers.
- Why do you want to see me?
- You'll soon find out.
Kill Escargot!
I'm really very tired.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Night, 1789. A dank and ancient building,
not far from the palace...
... was the destination of
the rebels and their captives.
- Open the gate, Marcel!
- Open the gate, sir.
This is the safest place to keep them until they regain their senses. Bring them here.
Jacques, start the revolution yet?
No, just taking a midnight stroll.
- What have we got here?
- A couple of bookends for your library.
- Why are you laughing? Bring them in!
- Bring them in.
Yes, indeed. Bring them in. Bring them in.
Oh, indeed, yes. Oh, let's have them inside.
This is the way.
Now, Jacques, what seems to be the problem?
They've lost their minds.
They're crazy. It's safer for the revolution to leave them here.
I see. What are their names, Jacques?
Coupe. Charles and Claude Coupe.
Charles and Claude Coupe.
I see.
Now, we'll just see how serious their condition is. Remove their gags.
Now, gentlemen.
Beg your pardon.
Just relax and don't be afraid.
Now, young man, what is your name?
- My name? You want to know my name?
- Oh, yes.
- Is that what you're asking me?
- Yes.
- I'll tell you if you want to know.
- I do.
- Do you know why I'll tell you my name?
- No.
Do you want to know why
I'm going to tell you my name...
...you blithering, fatheaded, addle-brained idiot?
Because you asked me my name!
That's why I'm going to tell you my name! Because you...
See? I told you so. They're crazy!
I know. Now, young man, do you know who you are?
Of course I know who we are!
Who?
The Corsican brothers.
The Corsican brothers?
I'm so sorry.
Oh, do forgive me.
I'm so sorry. The Corsican brothers!
You're right. They're crazy!
Later that night, 1789.
Looks good, doesn't it?
Yeah, that's right, like pillows in a bed.
- Let's get out of here.
- What are we gonna do now?
You may not know it, Charlie, but we're in trouble.
- Trouble?
- That's right.
But we fooled them at the ball, though, didn't we?
I don't think we fooled them.
We must kill them quickly and quietly.
Very quietly.
Has the king forgiven me?
Am I free? Am I free?
- Who are you?
- I'm the Man in the Iron Mask.
How do you do?
What is it? Do I look so horrible?
Do I frighten you?
No, no. It's just that you reminded me of somebody else.
I'm so glad you came.
So am I. So am I.
How can I ever thank you?
Oh, it's nothing, nothing.
You have a nice place here.
Oh, oh, watch the mask.
Watch the mask.
- Take me with you.
- Take me with you! Yes!
Don't leave me alone. Take me.
I'll arrange everything. I'll come back, and we'll have a nice walk.
- Please! Please don't leave me here.
- You're my friend. I wouldn't leave you.
If I take you with me,
I won't know who you are.
I thought the king forgave me.
Friar, what are you doing here?
Oh, I was merely making my nightly rounds.
Bless this room.
What's all the excitement out there?
My brothers are out celebrating tonight.
Do they always carry guns?
Merely a new church policy.
Don't move, my child.
- What is it?
- I have a vision.
Then, you know I'm troubled?
Hold nothing back from me.
Oh, thank goodness, you've come.
It's such a relief to unburden myself...
...even if it is in the wrong religion.
- Oh, yes. Yes, I know.
Friar, what religion is this?
It's a very new one.
You're my first convert.
You're... You're Pierre de Sisi.
Yes, you have guessed correctly.
- But why are you dressed like that?
- I must, to do good in this world of evil.
If you'll excuse me, there is much good left to be done.
In my dressing room?
- Is that your dressing room?
- Yes.
- Is this the only door to your dressing room?
- Yes.
- There's no outside door?
- No.
Bless this dressing-room door.
Excuse me.
What are you doing in a monk's habit?
You said we wouldn't do the monk and the choirboy anymore!
I did?
Oh, well, what would you like to do?
At home, you said you wanted to do the woodchopper and the shepherd.
I didn't know about the monk and the choirboy.
How many costumes do you think I can pack?
Oh, you little snail, you.
We'll soon be rid of that bed hog.
You rabbit.
Oh, I love you.
There's much killing to be done yet.
After the marriage, we'll kill Christina, kill Louis, then together, we'll rule all France.
- Have they been killed yet?
- No, Your Grace. They've all escaped.
You fools.
- Must I do everything myself?
- Evening, Victor.
- Good evening.
- We have work to do.
Come on, you imbeciles.
Philippe?
- Philippe. Philippe, my darling. You came.
- Hello.
My new plan is to rule France with you.
You will kill Escargot, marry Christina and take over the Belgian army...
...then kill Christina, kill Louis, marry me, and together...
...we will rule France.
Good.
Good.
- I love you.
- Kill.
- I love you.
- Kill. France.
Good!
- We're going to do it!
- I know. I love you.
What was that?
- Evening, Heinrich.
- Your Majesty, the carriage is not ready.
Very well. Keep trying.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- Who was that?
- Another plan.
- Am I in it?
- No.
- Good. I had best be going.
- No, just one minute.
I must divert Escargot and his men.
- What?
- I said, just one minute.
I must divert Escargot and his men.
Good.
Good.
Since destiny rides in our scabbard, it appears our pregnant blades must be aborted.
Are you sure that's necessary?
You miss my point.
We must join forces again.
- Against Marie.
- Marie?
- But she seems like a very nice person.
- But I have a plan.
Oh, you have a plan.
Oh, well, that's different.
I'll marry Christina, take over the
Belgian army, kill Louis, kill Christina...
...kill Marie, and together, with you and your brother, we will rule France.
That's a good plan.
- For France.
- For France.
Quickly, before Marie returns.
- Isn't that the?
- Two glasses of wine and he sleeps all night.
Still later that night, 1789.
I'm getting filthy down here!
Did you hear what I said?
I'm getting filthy down here!
- It's your turn to dig.
- I do not dig. I have a bad back.
Everything about you is bad.
Not just your back. Everything is bad!
I'm tired of doing all your work for you!
- What do you think I am, a...?
- Philippe, where have you gone?
Help me!
- Are you hiding from me?
- There's a tunnel down here!
- What?
- I said, there's a tunnel down here.
Are your ears as bad as your back?
Someone is coming.
- Who?
- I don't know. Just get me out of here.
Hurry. Quickly, give me a hand.
Someone is coming.
There is someone down there. Quickly.
I'm free. Free at last.
- It's the Man in the Iron Mask.
- I thought I was free.
Have pity.
Don't send me back to the palace.
- He must have come from the palace.
- Help me.
No, don't do that.
What's the matter with you? Are you deaf?
I will not do that.
Filthy swine!
Philippe, will you stop stepping on my heels?
Can I help it if I have this enormous stride?
Look at it, man. Look at it.
You see? You see what I'm going through?
You see this stride? Look!
The next day, 1789.
My, what a big back, Your Grace.
- Really?
- Far bigger than the king's.
Is it? What about my neck?
- That's bigger than the king's too.
- What about...?
- Good morning, Your Grace.
- Good morning, Your Grace.
- Good morning, Your Grace.
- Good morning, Your Grace.
But, Your Grace, it's perfume.
- Perfume?
- Yes, for the bath.
Well, I know it's perfume.
I was making a little joke.
Get out! Out.
You had best do as he says.
He's quite impossible.
Quite, sir.
- Having a good time?
- Yes.
You know, the whole court has been watching.
Come on, out of the tub.
What's happening, Claude?
What's happening?
You really don't know what's been happening after last night?
- I thought all that was settled.
- Settled?
You thought that was settled?
You know what those monks were trying to do to us last night?
Kill us?
And Marie, you know what she wanted to do?
Kill us?
- And Escargot, do you remember Escargot?
- Yes.
You know what he wanted to do?
- Kill us.
- That's right, Charlie.
Come on, off your ass!
Where are we going, Claude?
- The Spanish border!
- Spanish border?
- Right.
- Can I take Christina?
You might as well.
You told her everything.
- I'm taking Mimi.
- How are you going to get Mimi?
Don't worry, I'm getting her.
- Are you Mimi Montage?
- Yes.
- Come with us. You're under arrest.
- Who wants her arrested?
- Philippe de Sisi.
- De Sisi?
Come along quietly or we'll burn down your farm. Take her away.
- No, she has done nothing!
- Please, Father. I will go quietly.
I will go quietly because it is best for everyone.
For the people, for France.
As Christians, we should treat each other with human kindness, with love.
I will go quietly, not for myself, for my personal safety...
...but for the good of mankind, the good of my countrymen...
...the good of my village, my family, for France!
You said you would go quietly.
Burn down the farm.
No, leave him alone!
Go away!
No, leave me alone!
No!
- Come on, get up here.
- Save me!
Get up there. Come on.
The Montage girl is down here, Your Grace.
- You're sure she's here?
- All prisoners are brought to the dungeon.
My, it's interesting.
Hello. Nice to see you.
- Hello.
- You...
Hello.
- Is it this way?
- Yes.
Take care.
Sorry, sorry.
Look but don't touch.
This one is tough.
Can't break the little beggar.
- Evening, evening.
- Evening, evening.
Everything all right?
- Fine.
- Good.
Fine, fine.
Nice suit. I like the way you dress.
- Like your shoes too.
- Yes.
How do you like the way we stuck her up?
Excellent, excellent!
This is really excellent work.
It's wonderfully tight.
It's neat. I like that.
- Good.
- Very good.
I didn't know they would take you to a dungeon.
Oh, Claude, what's happening?
Why did you bring me here?!
- Please.
- Why'd you bring me here?!
- Is she giving you any trouble?
- Just a bit.
You want me to crank her up?
No. No, that's all right. I can handle it.
- I can use the exercise. Thank you.
- Yes, Your Grace.
Mimi, don't call me Claude.
I'll explain later.
- But, Claude...
- I said, don't call me Claude.
I don't understand.
Why didn't you come and get me?
They think I'm Philippe de Sisi.
- The aristo?
- Yes, that's the one.
I'm delighted to see you all stuffing yourselves...
...while France has cramps from the tyranny of its own indigestion.
- What's the matter? What's happened?
- The peasants are preparing an open revolt.
Get my army. Summon my soldiers.
- Get my army!
- Louis, how many times...
...do I have to tell you your army is in the field pillaging the rest of Europe?
What is the matter?
Who stirred up the rabble?
The senseless arrest of some peasant girl.
Jacques is starting the revolution tomorrow.
He's storming the palace.
He can't. We're supposed to go to Spain.
- We're patriots. We must help the revolution.
- We've got to stop the revolution.
- Stop it?
- Yes.
What about France?
- Equality, liberty, freedom!
- No, Mimi, not here.
- Has she given you any trouble?
- Yes! Yes!
- Want me to crank her up?
- Yes! Crank her!
Hurry, crank her! Crank her up!
Crank her. Faster! Faster! Crank her!
- What else did you learn?
- They're moving new troops in.
- They say it might be tonight.
- How many?
Well, how do I know? I'm blind!
Get to your observation post and keep your eyes open.
Right.
- Do you want to stop the revolution?
- Of course.
I'll use my military alliance when you...
Oh, no, you marry you.
- Christine, would you tell him?
- I have a confession, Your Majesty.
I cannot marry. I am not the princess, only her humble handmaiden.
And I gave her my best room.
I have a confession. I am not Pierre de Sisi.
I am Charles Coupe.
Oh, no.
And I, too, have a confession, Your Majesty.
I am not Philippe de Sisi. I am Claude Coupe.
How dreadful.
I, too, have a confession, perhaps the worst of all.
- Don't tell me you're not the king?
- Of course I'm the king.
Well, then, what is your confession?
My marriage is a failure.
- Did anyone else know of these confessions?
- No.
Good.
Then, you can still marry Christina, and I can have the Belgian army.
There is no Belgian army.
They're attacking Japan.
- What?
- You missed an earlier confession.
Who is going to fight?
These peasants will kill us.
Not if you write those reforms.
There won't be any revolution.
But what do I know what they want?
How do they know themselves?
They're just peasants.
I'm not signing anything.
Your Majesty, do you know who is outside the palace?
- Yes.
- Do you know how many men they have?
Of course.
- Do you know what they want to do to you?
- Yes.
What?
- Kill me.
- That's right, Louis.
Halt!
What is it now?
Another 26 men and two women have arrived.
- How many does that give us?
- Three hundred and forty-nine.
Men and women, we need you all. Good luck.
- Philippe, this is the way to the palace.
- No, it's not. It's this way.
- Philippe, it's this way.
- It's this way.
I know it's this way.
Here, give me a hand.
Watch this for me a minute, will you?
I'll be right back.
- What's that?
- That's my fiancée, Mimi.
- Where am I?
- It can't be. It's my sister.
- It's what?
- She was carried off by Gypsies.
Oh, Mimi, I'm so glad to see you!
You're all I have left!
What are you doing?
I was never carried off by Gypsies.
- You weren't?
- No.
Yes, you are my sister.
Doesn't this mean anything to you?
No.
You have a birthmark just like mine.
I don't have a birthmark like that.
It's lovely, but...
- You must have one somewhere.
- No, I haven't!
Wait a minute, girls. Wait a minute.
Mimi, you could be wrong.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you show that to her again.
You know, just to be sure.
The girls are in Christine's room.
- Is the proclamation ready?
- Finally.
All the chance he's had for education, you think he could spell.
Just seal it.
As king of France and all the powers vested in me by my sacred oath...
- Just put your seal on it, Your Majesty.
- Yes.
Yes.
- Oh, that's hot.
- That does it. France will be free.
- And you will be dead.
- Traitors, all of you.
Not me. Not me. They made me do it.
- They hurt me. They really hurt me.
- Louis, be quiet.
- He's...
- They really beat...
- You sniveling coward.
- Yes, but a loyal one. Loyal to the crown.
- Seize them. Seize them.
- Wait a minute. I have a better idea.
I have an even better idea.
Close your eyes for one second. Just a second.
Here, catch.
My clock. My clock!
We'll deal with you later.
Kill the de Sisis on sight.
- Should we get our monks' habits?
- No, you idiot.
I will personally reward the man who kills them.
- They'll kill them now.
- If they don't kill each other first.
- Louis?
- Don't hit me, please.
I had to say it.
Have pity, pity on a coward.
- Are you with us now?
- Of course I'm with you.
- We must find Jacques.
- This way. Come on.
There they are.
- Don't let them cry out.
- Are you insane, man?
- With these great hands, I can easily...
- I know. I know. I know.
I'll take the one on the right.
You take the one on the left.
All right, I'll take the one on the left.
You take the one on the right.
- What is the meaning of this?
- I have come for my reward.
- You mean, you've killed the de Sisis?
- Oh, no, but I saw them.
Very well. Keep trying.
- Death to the king!
- But what about our agreement?
Our agreement.
We don't deal with double-dealers, be it the king or Escargot.
- Your time has come.
- So, Escargot.
Betrayed by the betrayer.
Halt.
Swine.
Jacques? Jacques?
The Coupes.
Jacques? Jacques?
What's going on?
Jacques? Jacques? The Coupes.
Have you seen the Coupes?
They escaped.
- I have no time for that.
- I must capture them.
Give me 6000 of your men.
- No, use your dogs.
- These dogs are crazy.
Get these crazy hounds off me.
Get those crazy hounds out of here!
Here, take this to Claude.
- Not me! That's me!
- Louis, get out of here or you'll get killed.
Oh, no, don't. No, it's me. Don't.
Here, take this. I'll get my valise.
"Liberty, equality, frat..."
I don't find that amusing.
Where is that swine?
Get off me! I'm telling you,
I don't have a birthmark!
- Oh, Claude, you've come back!
- Swine!
Off your knees, sir.
Your cowardice is showing.
Not in the back. Not in the back.
In Corsica, they say there are 68 ways to kill a man.
You shall be the 69th.
My teeth!
- My teeth.
- Your teeth? Come here, you coward.
I want more than your teeth.
Up here. Up here.
- Escargot got away. Did you see him?
- No.
- Did you kill Louis?
- No. Why would I kill Louis?
Why?
What do you mean, "why?"
Have you seen this?
Of course I've seen it.
You get the girls.
I'll meet you in the garden.
- Get the what?
- The girls.
- How did you get here so fast?
- I took the secret passageway.
- How did you get here so fast?
- I took the secret passageway.
Are you all right?
Come on, let's go!
I've waited a long time for this day.
- We attack at dawn?
- At dawn, you idiot?
No, we attack now. Prepare to attack!
- Hurry up, we've got to get to Jacques.
- Come on.
- I know you are my sister!
- Stop fooling around and come on.
Don't slow down.
We've got to get to Jacques.
We've got to get the proclamation to Jacques.
Charge!
We've found him. Jacques.
- We did it. You can stop.
- We did it!
- We did it!
- Stop, Jacques.
We did it, Jacques.
Hey, Jacques!
Fire.
Fire!
Fire, you idiot.
You're my sister.
And so it came to pass,
the meeting of the brothers.
Coupe and de Sisi, de Sisi and Coupe
brother and brother, peasant and nobleman.
This was the moment we'd been waiting for.
What would happen?
Listen to this.
"This incredible meeting was to write a glittering new page in history.
For you see..."
Now no one will know the secret.
Get the book.
Did you have to shoot them?
- I didn't know you were gonna shoot them.
- Bring me that book.
You didn't have to shoot them.
We could have talked things over.
Talk?
Is that what you wanted? Talk?
Well, but you didn't have to...
...shoot them.
"This incredible meeting was to write a glittering new page in history.
For you see..."
Free! Free!

It does, Sir Henry.
Excellently.

You moved!
You moved.
Go and tell the NCO of that black shambles that you love him more than you love me.
Now!
You're not fit to be in the British Army, you different-coloured articles. Straighten up!
I'm to tell you, Corporal, that I love you more than my colour sergeant.
That's frightening. Get out of my bloody sight!
Put your rifle over your head and double round this field till you drop bloody dead!
Now move! Get on with it! At the double!
Get back in the ranks, you shower of animals!

Present arms!
Over here, boys! Over here!
Come on, here we go.
No, no! One at a time.

Candles? ..The money, please.
SPEAKS AFRIKAANS Are you passing through?
We've come to fight the Zulu. We aren't at war yet. Bit young.
My nephew. He can shoot, track, speak Zulu and fight. He's got assegai marks to prove it.
Show him.
- You! - Sir!
Take them to the orderly officer. Colour Sergeant!
This way.
Company...'shun!
Move yourselves!
Shall I give the order, sir? All right, Sergeant.
SIKALI HORSE, FORWARD!
Splendid horsemanship. Who are they?
Sikali Horse, my lord. Christians all. I know each man by name.
Do they come well recommended? They rode for me at Bushman's Pass.
Oh, indeed.
Crealock, see that Col Durnford has an officer for his hard riders - the subaltern from the 24th.
It might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Yes. I see you issued each of them with a Martini-Henry carbine.
Our quota for natives - one rifle to ten men and five rounds per rifle. Will they make good use of them?
They're as good marksmen as horsemen.No doubting their horsemanship, Col Durnford.
Crealock.
We'll think how to make best use of Col Durnford's African knowledge.
Col Durnford. William Vereker.Yes? I hear you're seeking officers.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot.
Private Williams!
You've stopped.
THEY SPEAK BANTU
Mr Raw!
Take Mr Vereker to the store and see he's issued the necessary equipment.
And then show him to the mess and explain to him how an officer's expected to behave.
Our good Col Durnford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
It's rumoured Lord Chelmsford's to make Durnford second-in-command. Typical of Her Majesty's Army!
Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.Now, now, Mr Melvill. Less of your spleen.
Stranger in the mess! Gentlemen, my lord.
Announce yourself.
Good day, Frederick.
Good day, William.
Pleased you could join us.It was that or join the Zulu.Join the Zulu?
Oh, yes, you're in the thick of it.
Your father said you were farming near Zululand.
Sent his regards, should I meet up with you.
That's nice of the old boy. You'd better call out who you are.
William Vereker.
Sgt Murphy, bring drinks for the stranger.
Allow me to introduce the mess.
Col Pulleine.
Messrs Melvill,
Coghill,
Jackson,
Milne, Major Russell, Stevenson... How do you do?
Harford and Harford's best friend.
Don't leave your gin around, or Harford will have it full of preserved butterflies.
Damn waste, if you ask me.
There's a shortage of that where I've been.
They fight with spears, don't they? Is that fair against a Martini-Henry?
Did you really choose between Britain and the Zulu?
A damn close thing it was, too. Ah, well done, Murphy.
Stranger's cup. Down it in one and we share your mess bill for a week.
And if I don't? You buy a bottle of good claret for each mess member.
If it's too much, we'll forward the bill to your father in the House of Lords. No offence meant, Vereker.
No offence taken, Melvill.
To men who aren't afraid to speak their minds.
< Good luck, sir.
Down, down, down!
Down, down, down, down!
Not quite.
The bottles of claret are on me, gentlemen.
The regiment!
ALL: The regiment!
The regiment.
ZULUS CHEER AND SHOUT
Very good!
Thank you!
Anthony. Anthony!
Hold this.
Well batted! Well batted!
HE SPEAKS BANTU
Joseph! How are the Colenso girls?
They're all in the garden, sir. They'll be glad to see you, I'm sure.
Ready? Right!
Oh, you beast!
Somebody! Ah, that fooled you!
Tipped it! Out! I did not!
William!
You cheat! You!
Me cheat?! Same old Fanny!
Welcome! Welcome back!
Excuse me, ladies.
Did you get your farm going?
Yes, I did.
How was it?
I've never been so happy.
Sorry you had to leave.
You've met the Hon William Vereker, I believe.
Yes. We were childhood friends.
Your childhood friend shot a dead cow at the gallop yesterday.
Most impressive!
There is a Mrs Durnford, is there?
She exists but nothing's been heard of her the eight years Durnford's been in Africa.
Although much is spoken of her now, my lord.
I recommended him to you because he knows Africa so well.
Indeed. His ability to recruit native contingents is proving invaluable.
How do you rate him as a soldier?
It is widely held he has courage and he's an excellent engineer.
Shall we join the guests?
Do you think she might become interested in...someone?
Which one? The one who keeps looking at me.
Could be you flatter yourself - it's her odd eye.
They must've locked the good ones up!
Ah! General!
Do you find our border country congenial, my lord?
Landscape - congenial, ma'am. As a border - vulnerable.
Do you really think Cetshwayo will attack us?
The intention of the Zulu Impi and their king concern me deeply.
He has no intention of attacking Natal - unless he's given no option.
He has no quarrel with us.
How rare to meet a young lady interested in tactical matters!
Is it not most rare?
You are talking of a violent and murdering barbarian with an army of 30,000 warriors just across the river.
My father has lived with the Zulus for many years.
Cetshwayo massacred 20,000 people to become king!
The English Tudor kings did no less - much later in our nation's history, I might add.
And the French, much more recently.
That may well be, your grace, but be that as it may, my duty is clear...
..the defence of all this - Natal.
Yes.
Well, it's difficult to stand against that position -
IF you speak only of defence.
And what does our good Col Durnford think? >
If the people of Natal wish to feel safe, let them persuade their husbands and sons to volunteer. We need officers and men.
We do, Colonel. Good point.
I cannot be brought to believe that Cetshwayo wants a war with Britain.
Every Zulu is raised to be a warrior.
Without war, there's no Zulu nation.
Nobody is really safe, are they?
Mrs DeWitt has four daughters, Henry, and I fear she feels for them all. >
Your daughters may indeed be in some danger, Mrs DeWitt - but not from the Zulus.
MUSIC DROWNS OUT SPEECH
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please!
I think I should inform you that I am obliged to issue a notification declaring a state of war between Her Majesty's Government and the Zulu king, Cetshwayo, on his non-compliance with the ultimatum made on him, urging reparation and redress for violations of British sovereignty.
SCATTERED APPLAUSE
Why?
Why do men think of nothing but killing?
This is a wonderful land we're privileged to share.
Dear God...
..there should be room for all of us!
There goes No 2 Company.
Quartermaster. Quartermaster.
I'll see ya!
No-no!
Do I believe what me eyes see?
The whole bleedin' army moving off to meet the murdering heathen and what goes on in here? A game of brag! BRAG!
Sorry, Quartermaster.
You'll be more sorry when the Zulu ask, "What can you offer me not to slit your gut?"
And you'll say, "The knave of hearts, sir! The knave of hearts!"
THEY CHUCKLE Move!
For the savage, as for the child, chastisement is sometimes a kindness.
Let us hope, General, that this will be the final solution to the Zulu problem.
Come on, boys! Get up!
Quick! Calm down!
And again! Come back here, you thief!
About ready, sir.
My lord, I've prepared a list of ideas for you to see.
Excellent! Give them to Crealock.
My lord, this list was prepared for you. I don't think another can understand its true value.
Thank you, Col Durnford.
Gentlemen, within ten days we shall cross the Buffalo River and British soldiers will then be in Zululand.
Col Durnford will remain down-river and defend the Natal border.
Will you hear Last Post, sir?
I listened to your Stand To this morning. It was perfect.
Couldn't have done it better myself - even when I was bugler to Wellington.
Where did you get that black eye? The cooks saw me dip your shaving tin in their tea water. Made their tea taste of soap, they said.
So you got it in the line of duty.
Point taken.
Will we be fighting the Zulu soon?
Could be.
ATTAS!
When we cross the river into Zululand they might be waiting there for us to show up - them stabbing assegias pointing right at our bellies!
Are you afeard of the Zulu?
One Zulu is only one man, and I'm afeard of no one man!
But the Zulu, they come in thousands, like a black wave of death, in their thousands.
Them assegias, stabbing!
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
I am to take the Sikali with the main column to the river.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
Chelmsford wants a good man on the border - he fears a flanking attack and wants you in reserve.
The wrong side of the river, the wrong place?!
Does he wish me to fight the Zulu or merely observe their habitat?
Sir.
God go with you, Mr Vereker.
SOLDIERS: Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip! Hooray! Hip-hip! Hooray!
GET UP NOW! GET ON!
Get off his arse, you bloody idiot!
KEEP 'EM IN LINE!
Sarge! Sarge! I'm drowning, Sarge!
What the hell do you mean by having the same name as me?!
Sorry, Sarge!
Do you think Cetshwayo will send a party to greet you?
They're here. We just have to ensure they don't get back to announce us.
You mean you've seen them?
Forward, Sikali!
Come on! Come on!
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Nogg, sir. Actual name is Norris Newman. He's from The Standard.
Our runners bear his dispatches, do they not?Of course!
Come on, lads! It's only a river!
Come on! Make it today!
Come on, you lot! Get these bastards across!
It's only water! You'll only get wet! Come along, you idle scum!
Break that ammunition crate and I'll have your guts for garters!
An historic moment, don't you think?
Norris Newman of The Standard. I saw you lead our cavalry.
Indeed. I was one of the first across.Were they in good heart?
They spurred onto the high ground, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu.
Full of sport, they were, my lord.
Tell what you see, write it well, sir, and make sure you get it right.
If I've got it right, my lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand -
I see it all around me - but "Why?" is the question my readers will ask. "Why?"
Do not confuse yourself.
Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
So attack is your defence.
Well, let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis for destruction.
My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid engagement.
I have it, my lord, we attack for sport. Or is it reputations?
Enough of your politicking, Noggs.
I know your views on the press but people want to know what the regiments are doing.
Then I trust you will tell them exactly what you've observed.
Tricky business, Mr Bloomfield.
Look at that waste!
Five rounds ruined. Each round has to be accounted for.
It's terrible! Quite dreadful! Something must be done!
If they'd been put back in their boxes, the boxes screwed down - as his lordship ordered - nothing would've happened to them.
I refer to our drowned natives.
Natives is not on my invoices, Mr Harford.
Ammunition is, and has to accounted for, AND brass cartridge cases returned.
Several natives went under. Shouldn't we have a roll call?
Not practical - we haven't had time to make up the roll yet.
Besides, I'm not sure how many we had before the crossing.

Zulus!
Here!
I'm ill. Dozens of them followed me.
I must've shot five, six, ten - I lost count.
They just kept coming! Blood-curdling swine!
Why did they attack you? I discovered their army. ..A valley full of them.
- What army? - Beyond them hills and coming this way.
Mr Vereker, would you mind taking a look at this map?
By all means, Colonel.
Your wagons, Colonel. What about my wagons?
On this open slope you must bring them round and form them into a laager - immediately.
I hear you have prisoners, Colonel. Well done! Evening, William!
Thank you, sir!
I think you should hear this. Your brother didn't laager his camp... >
They had 73 in their party - they found 73 skeletons six months later.
Boers require a laager with only a few wagons - we have many.
An unassailable square of British fire power is a defence which can be formed in a moment. You're leaving us?
I'm going to camp among the rocks over there.
My lord, Mr Fannin claims to have seen the Zulu Impi - some few thousand or so - exactly here in this valley.
Unlikely - it would mean taking 24,000 men over mountain tops.
This is not helpful!
Have the prisoners brought to my camp.
SOLDIERS LAUGH All right, Corporal. Anything?
No, sir. Nothing.
Be sensible, man! Tell us!
Good evening! Dirty work, eh?
Very dirty.
PRISONER SPEAKS IN ZULU
What did they say?Claim they're deserters from the Impis in the east.
Followed this one so they could give themselves up, go home.
Do you believe that?
They're well oiled, fed regularly - it's unlikely they're fugitives.
Have them questioned further.
They claim the Impis are east towards the Royal Kraal and yet this fellow says they're further towards the north.
Wherever they are, there are 60,000 or more.
They multiply, Mr Fannin. You speak the Zulu tongue?
Tomorrow I intend to find the Zulu Impi and you will accompany me.
I'm no soldier, your honour, and it's further into Zululand.
You will accompany me or you will me arrested.
This way, Mr Fannin.
Crealock, we have scouts where he claims he saw the Zulus?
Of course, sir.And?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Thank you.
Why don't the Zulus attack?
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but that doesn't mean to say they've got no brains.
They'll watch us and wait - find our weaknesses.
Have we weaknesses, Quartermaster?

Crealock, old fella,
I'm doing notes for my dispatch and I need to clear up a few military points.
I don't want to bother his lordship.
I had it drummed into me that a good commander never willingly splits his force - especially in an enemy's country - before knowing their dispositions.
If we were facing a European enemy with guns, your point would hold.
May I remind you, I do not create the strategies you comment on.
I'm only his lordship's secretary.
I wouldn't take overly comfort from that, Crealock, old fella, because if he sinks, then you sink with him.
So, you've been asked to look after me, Lieutenant.
I assure you, sir, I have no desire to create difficulties.
And I say you do not. I'd be obliged for your advice.
What have your scouts seen? So far, only THEIR scouts.
But we've had reports of a small Impi further north, over there.
His lordship believes it's far too difficult an approach to be chosen by the Zulu command.
Yes, well, difficulty never deterred a Zulu commander. How many?
We don't know.
I think it would be wise to picket the hills.
Just in case.

YOSHIKURA CITY SLAUGHTERHOUSE
HISTORY OF POSTWAR JAPAN
TOLD BY A BARMAN
In February 1958, 
I bought this place in Yokosuka.
ONBORO BAR
It was run by a guy from Yokohama, a gangster.
One day he hurt a soldier and no one came to his place anymore.
The bar was at the end of an alley, so I wasn't sure it'd go well.
But at the time I wasn't married,
I worked day and night and made lots of money.
When I acquired it, the place was called "Onoboro."
I continued to call it that because I'd no money.
- To change name you had to pay?
- Sure.
Drawing up new documents costs money.
But the place had stayed shut for two years.
I didn't imagine it would become mine.
Hiroshima is a pile of rubble.
Nothing blocks the view.
The atom bomb had devastating effects.
The immense heat produced killed and wounded many people.
Many survivors sickened with leukemia and died.
Emiko, where were you when the war ended?
I was home, because school was closed for summer vacation.
Were you home when the Emperor spoke?
I was at my neighbor's.
He was a shoemaker and his son a bank director.
We all went to his house to hear the speech.
What do you remember?
Radio networks then weren't so developed, the reception was very shaky.
But I understood clearly that the war was over.
In the video everyone's standing to listen to the Emperor.
We too, at the beginning, we came to attention.
Because they played the national anthem.
When we understood the war was over, we relaxed.
The police were watching and we couldn't show our joy.
But it was transparent on faces.
We felt really relieved.
- Did some cry?
- No, we all felt better.
We didn't show it outwardly, but underneath we were happy.
In Yoshikura did you see anyone despair like we see in the video?
No one cried for things so stupid.
American soldiers came to Yoshikura?
Yes. We heard the armistice speech.
We were relieved by the end of the war, but worried about the future..
We knew the Americans soldiers had come to Okinawa.
They advanced slowly northward toward the principal Japanese islands.
We wondered if they were dangerous for the girls.
We wondered a lot about that.
At the start of autumn,
I saw lots of American jeeps land.
They stayed several months.
They didn't create any problem.
The Americans were nice, real gentlemen.
My family ran a butcher shop that had a big garden.
The soldiers thought it was a bar and came in asking alcohol.
We were afraid and hid behind a sliding door.
There was a hole about a centimeter big which we spied on the
American soldiers through.
They didn't look evil.
They always carried chocolate, soap, or other things.
They seemed likable, so we were less worried about the others.
When the festival period came, the fear has already passed.
At that time the festival took place in Kotani.
One day, while we were camping back from Kotani.
I had a fortune teller predict my future.
It was something I liked.
The seer analyzed my first and last name and said I was destined for business.
He advised me to run a brothel, despite my young age.
- You were 15?
- Yes
He advised me to run a brothel and then, reading my hand, said I'd do something abroad.
At the end of summer, you went back to school?
No, I stopped going.
You left school?
Why?
Something unpleasant happened.
What?
At the school I went to arrived a new boy.
- He came from Yoshikura?
- Yes.
He told my classmates my family had a butcher shop and that we killed cows.
My best friend asked me if it was true.
I knew nothing about it, so when I got home 
I asked my mother.
A man can marry a woman of a social class higher than his, provided his parents consent.
We women, however, can't marry men from higher classes.
We cannot change the social class we're born into.
We have to work a lot to get a little respect.
Since I'd never be able to marry a middle-class man and didn't like to study,
I decided to work with my family and give up studying.
After summer vacation,
I went with her to the station.
But next morning I saw her shoes in the house's garden.
I became suspicious.
I went to the first floor and saw she was sleeping.
I got very angry.
I hit her with a baseball bat we had in the house.
You started working?
Yes, at the Agricultural Bank of Yoshikura
I worked there six months.
I liked a couple colleagues.
One of them paid court to me.
I liked him a lot.
But we scarcely knew each other, so I didn't trust him much.
Did they know about your origins?
They were from Yoshikura too, so surely they'd have known.
I knew they'd never marry me,
I thought they wanted to take advantage of me.
In that period was the passage from the old yen to the new yen.
I remember stamps were distributed to attach to banknotes.
June 27, at 9 in the morning, the ship Takasagomaru brought home 
2000 soldiers from the Soviet Union.
The soldiers, crowded on the bridge of the ship, reply enthusiastically to the salute of the people welcoming them.
In the big cities, the homeless die of hunger and cold.
Everywhere people struggle against poverty and hunger.
The cities are destroyed.
Trains leaving the disaster zones are attacked.
Students invent the taxi-bicycle to pay for their studies.
At school old books are exchanged.
The black market spreads everywhere.
Tokyo swarms with abusive peddlers, but at the Shunjuku market prices are transparent.
Wholesale, piece and refill prices are indicated.
At the time did one earn a lot with meat?
Profit was sure.
But there were various ways to make money.
- You mean the black market?
- Exactly.
Unreported heads were killed and then their meat sold.
It was very profitable.
- The authorities didn't brand cattle?
- They did.
But butchers had a false stamp similar to the original.
They used that to brand the beasts.
I think they did that.
My father was a butcher, just like his father.
- And your mother's father?
- I don't know...
Maybe he was a butcher too.
- And your mother's mother too?
- I think so.
Then your father came...
Originally he wasn't a butcher.
My father's sister married my mother's older brother and so my father came to work at the store.
At 14, my mother was going to high school.
My father fell in love with her, but since he wasn't studying he hadn't courage to declare himself.
He went back home and married another.
My mother wanted to be a nurse.
She started going to nursing school.
She knew a pharmacists there and got pregnant.
When my mother went home to give birth, she saw my father again.
Together they abandoned their own children and fled to Yoshikura.
- When did you start menstruating?
- At 15.
- When the Pacific War ended?
- Exactly.
In Yoshikura, did the first menstruation get celebrated?
Some did, but not my family.
- You helped in the store then?
- Yes.
We rented a store on
Kaizan Street.
We opened a second store, a sort of branch.
I was there from morning to night to run it.
That's how I knew a policeman named Shimura.
- A police station was nearby?
- Not exactly.
There was an office where interrogations were held.
Shimura went there often and so, seeing each other often, we became friends.
Then, I don't know why, we began living together without marrying.
The police watched the black market?
Yes.
- Your store was at risk?
- Yes. That's why I stayed with him.
Really?
I did so out of self interest.
Else what'd we have done?
It wasn't a good premise for our rapport, but he was a good policeman and my family was vulnerable.
I thought, "If I stay with him, he'll keep me informed on police movements.
"So, if I have to give my virginity to someone, might as well be him."
So you stayed with him to help your family?
I'd say so.
At that time my father was denounced because during a check on the store they found a huge quantity of skins.
I went to the police station and saw he'd been maltreated.
That really grieved me, so I thought being with a policeman would have its advantages.
- So, when there were inspections…
- We knew beforehand and took the excess skins to the country.
Meat was difficult to hide, but not the skins.
Thanks to him, we had no more problems.
And we profited from that.
- Je furnished you useful info.
- Indeed.
IMPRISONMENT OF 
POLITICAL DETAINEES
At the time the Communist 
Part was at its peak.
The political detainees were freed.
Were there Communist movements also in Yoshikura?
I think so, but my family didn't participate in them actively.
But my father's brother-in- law was a militant.
He spoke often of Schuichi Tokuda and Sanzo Nosaka.
SANZO NOSAKA, LEADER PF THE PEOPLE,
RETURNS TO HIS COUNTRY
But in Yoshikura no particular notice was taken.

In Sendai 600 workers call for dismissal of Yoshida government.
In Osaka 20,000 workers assemble.
In Tokyo, in front of the 
Imperial Palace,
500,000 people have come to manifest with protest signs.
Let's overturn the 
Yoshida government!
After prohibition of strikes imposed by General MacArthur, the Workers Committee met on 
January 31.
Secretary General Hase, after long debate, cancelled the strike planned for February 1.
At the Shiinamachi branch of the Eikoku Bank there were 12 victims.
On the 6th, near Hayase station, was discovered the body of Shimoyama,
President of the State Railway.
A freight train ran over him and tore him in a thousand pieces.
The scenario of the massacre is bloodcurdling.
The Mitaka case shocked the world.
August 17, the train coming from Aomori derailed and overturned.
The police started an investigation.
How was life with Shimura?
He left the police and came to work with me.
He was a good policeman, but the store didn't suit him, he didn't like that type of work.
So instead of working, he started taking walks.
He behaved badly, he beat me in front of people.
Soon I understood I couldn't count on him.
We fought over nothings.
If I said a guy was named X, he'd say he was named Y.
- Was he a bully?
- Not really.
But it was clear one couldn't trust him.
I got pregnant but decided to abort.
I got pregnant again, but aborted again.
My husband behaved badly and I wanted a divorce.
My parents and in-laws told me to have a son, thus my husband would calm down.
I brought Akemi into the world, but my husband didn't change.
SHIMURA
After school, you went straight into the police.
I knew nothing about business, but I was forced to work as a butcher.
No normal person would put up with that kind of work.
I thought I could do it.
I even worked without pay.
All the money ended up in my wife's pockets.
I was always asking her for money.
I was forced to live like that.
I think I made valid contributions to their activity.
My son-in-law worked little.
Saturday and Sunday he wanted to rest, he didn't want to touch cattle.
Six months after starting work with us he sickened with tuberculosis, and was a year recovering.
He didn't do anything particular for us.
How did they cure him?
With penicillin.
We bought 100 tablets at 8500 yen each.
How was business going?
My parents knew how to do.
They bought cattle wholesale and resold them.
They made a lot of money.
COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS
FORBIDDEN IN PUBLIC WORKS
June 6, the government accepts 
General MacArthur's request.
It removes from public office 
24 Communist Party representatives, including Tokuda, Nosaka, Higashi.
June 7, 17 journalists are also fired.
IN TOKYO AND OSAKA EXPULSION 
OF 10,000 PEOPLE REVOKED
October 13 the government revoked the removals of Communists from public office.
The government decided to revoke the law of expulsions from public offices that affected 10,000 people.
CONFLICT IN KOREA
The Allies bomb strategic targets in North Korea, including arsenals and communication routes.
It gets called "The Korean War."
I remember talking about it with my neighbors.
It was summer, my daughter 
Akemi had just been born.
People said that in case of conflict we'd have to leave the country, because the Koreans and Chinese would land in Japan.
I remember that well.
After the war, we got rich thanks to black market meats and hides.
We the Korean War we profited even more.
When was Akemi born?
February 2, 1950.
- I gave birth in the hospital.
- In Yoshikura?
Yes.  They did a caesarian.
At the time my husband had an extramarital relationship.
He was going to the Shinagaki baths and was usually treated by a geisha.
Now and then he came home to ask for money.
If I didn't give him some, he beat me.
I asked if I'd done him some wrong, but he didn't reply.
He told me
"If I'd known what you were like,
I'd never have married you."
He insulted me, treated me like a slut.
I wanted a separation, but he feared gossip.
He said let the baby grow, and then things would be worked out.
But he continued having extramarital relations.
Being a policeman, he didn't know the value of money.
When he saw a lot of money he completely lost control.
I spoke with my family and together we decided to take a place.
We opened a pachinko game salon to be run by my husband.
I think it was 1951, because Akemi was one year old.
So Shimura became the owner of the game salon.
Yes.
The place did well.
My husband took a percentage of the winnings.
The game salon drew lots of people, so it earned well.
But this enabled him to know other women.
In revenge, I thought I should find another man.
One day I told him, "I'll have an extramarital relation too."
He replied, "You're ugly, you won't find anybody!"
"Yes I will," I said.
I remember there was a student who worked in another game salon.
Named Fujita.
I said to my husband,
"I'll make love with Fujita."
He replied, "You won't succeed."
"Yes I will, even if I have to pay him," I said.
JAPAN BECOMES AN 
INDEPENDENT STATE
The delegation of six members came onto the platform.
Six years after the end of the war, the bases were laid for an independent Japan.
You didn't fear gossip?
Sure, but I hurt too much.
My husband brought his women home and had them sleep in a room next to mine.
So, ultimately, gossip didn't interest me.
I had fun and could no longer stop myself.
- How did you lure them?
- Using my charm!
- I acted so he'd understand.
- You made an appointment?
I wrote him an unsigned letter.
I wanted him to think a friend of mine had written.
At the Tsukasa trattoria they made great pizza.
I suggested to him we go eat there.
That's how our affair started.
He still thinks the letter was written by my friend.
The end justifies the means.
Had I told him what I wanted, he'd not even have looked at me.
- Where'd you go the first time?
- To the thermal hotel Tsumura.
At the time there were only two hotels.
We wanted to eat something good, but didn't know where to go.
But my principal objective was to be with him.
- You proposed staying in the hotel?
- Yes, I was sick of waiting!
I went with him without scruple.
FUJITA
What did you think of her husband?
He was a fine person.
He was polite and well groomed.
He had clear skin.
You went often to Tokyo!
Fujita lived near the University?
No, his mother let rooms.
They were showing "Gone with the 
Wind" then at the Shinkuju cinema.
We preferred to go to the movies rather than take part in the demonstrations.
Demonstrators and police collide.
BLOODY MAY FIRST
It was 1952.
Were you in love with Fujita?
Yes.  I liked being with him.
How can I say...
Having a clandestine affair excited me.
I didn't tell my husband 
I was going to Tokyo.
- Then there were no rapid trains!
- True, it took about a day.
- Tokyo is far from Yoshikura.
- Yes, I had to change trains.
I often made a mistake and went in the opposite direction.
I'd no sense of direction.
- Fujita received you willingly?
- I think so.
WASEDA UNIVERSITY HOUSE
- Were you comfortable?
- Depending what time I arrived.
In the morning Fujita's mother was there too.
Of course I couldn't explain.
- So you waited till evening?
- Yes.
Why not go to a hotel?
I was ashamed.
I thought only prostitutes went to hotels..
And I considered myself different from them.
OSAKA, TOKYO
FIRST ENROLLMENT OF RESERVES
OF THE NATIONAL POLICE
August 23, the winners of the competition entered the service.
In full uniform they began the exercises.
ARE NATIONAL POLICE RESERVES 
PART OF THE ARMED FORCES?
TOKYO
INSTITUTE OF DEFENSE FORCES
October 15, day of their institution the Defense Forces parade in Jingu Stadium.
Our armed troops defend the security of out country.
You made up with Shimura?
Reconciled with him, much time passed.
He stopped going with prostitutes, but...
I recall at this time my mother and father were also in crisis.
To make love, two have to want it.
The problems between me and my husband frazzled their rapport too.
It was my fault.
I went to them off, ate and got drunk.
Things were always getting worse without my noticing.
Maybe my mother sought another man just to profit from him.
I don't know if they finally were in love.
One day I got drunk and told my mother what I thought.
She replied that everyone can make mistakes.
I replied one can't go on making the same errors year after year.
She said I wasn't considering her reasons.
She repeated she'd made a mistake.
Did you witness their rapport?
Yes, they made love in the bath.
I saw them with my eyes.
For this reason you left Shimura?
I hadn't love him for some time.
I no longer cared about the gossips, so I decided to leave.
Masako was born in 1955.
The father was Shimura...
Yes.
- So you were making love with him again?  - Yes.
How as the game salon doing?
Some machines were forbidden.
Clients diminished.
Many salons closed.
We thought we'd try a different activity.
At the time there were no pubs, tea shops or beerhalls.
Our place was rather big, so we decided to transform it into a pub.
It was the first time I did this sort of thing.
I told my husband I'd take a management course in Osaka, instead I went to Tokyo to meet Fujita.
I went there often and left my daughter Mami with my mother.
One day Fujita's mother invited me to a picnic
We went to Inogashira Park where there was a little lake with a bridge.
While we crossed the bridge, with parasol in hand, she said:
"Emiko, let's sing together?"
I didn't immediately understand, but she sang a little song.
- "Life Is Shot"?
- Yes.
She said, "I'll sing first, then you repeat it."
She was a bit eccentric.
She was funny, and clicked her dentures.
- But she sang well.
- I think so.
She was likable.
One day I told Emiko that I wanted to marry my actual wife.
She kept quiet awhile.
Then went out and disappeared for about three hours.
When I decided to go look for her,
I saw her coming back.
She'd died her hair red and had gaudy nail polish.
At the time there was a girl I liked a lot, named Michiko Hamamura.
She had hair died red and my sister Micchan imitated her.
My brother, fearing gossip, told her to stop, and beat her.
One day Micchan came to me.
At the time I was working in the tea room.
She told me she wanted to go away because our brother was beating her.
I told her she needed patience.
But she was determined to leave and since I was unhappy too,
I decided to follow her.
In August we went to Yokohama.
We wanted to go to Tokyo, but then decided on Yokohama.
Why?
In our place we often heard foreigners talking about Yokohama.
My sister liked foreigners and hoped to find one in Yokohama.
According to her they were nicer than Japanese.
She knew my husband beat me.
We stayed a week in a hotel.
At the end we asked a cab driver to show us a place for fun.
In front of the EM Club was a place called Blue Moon.
The owner was an old army comrade of the cabby, so he took us there.
YOKOSUKA
Japanese women could not go in the EM Club.
AN EX EMPLOYEE OF THE 
EM CLUB SPEAKS
It was a place of prostitutes serving soldiers.
It was a sort of breakwater.
50 women worked there, it was a big operation.
Sunagawa became an extension of the American base in Tachikawa.
For 4 days,
the squadron of survey specialists
tried to enter the city.
After repeated encounters, the soldiers fell back.
The citizens tried to block them, burning wood
and leaving manure from the fields.
There were scuffles everywhere.
The survey troops were protected by a cordon of police.
The resistance of the citizens continued.
After six months of protests the situation is still tense.
Then what did you do?
We worked at the Blue Moon for six months.
Meanwhile we looked for a good place to buy.
But with the war over people said that in Yokosuko few soldiers would remain.
So opening a place at that time would have been crazy.
But I didn't want to go home, so I asked an acquaintance to find me a bar and he proposed "Onboro."
When I went to see it, it seemed few people came there.
It didn't make a good impression on me.
But I didn't want to work more under a boss, so I bought it.
- How much did you pay?
- Oh...
- You don't want tax inspectors!
- Don't worry.
If you say so!
I didn't pay little.
At the time I didn't understand a word of English.
The girls taught me who worked for me.
Where were your daughters?
When I finished work, I went out with the other girls.
We went to the other neighborhood night places.
That's how I met the barman of a place near mine.
In the place I worked, there weren't rooms for love making.
So we met in hotels.
When my family discovered this relationship, they sent me the children.
- Just because you had a relationship?
- Yes.
Why?
They were looking after my daughters so I could work at the place.
But when they knew about this man, they didn't want to do it anymore.
It didn't go exactly like that.
Akemi was very troubled,
I'd had problems educating her..
It was right that the children were followed by their mother.
How old were they then?
Akemi 9, and Mami 4.
My companion and I rented an apartment in Hinode-cho and went to live there.
FIRST FLOOR OF ONBORO BAR
Akemi and Mami live in the place along with other people..
We went back to the apartment just to sleep.
Meanwhile my father and mother were breaking up.
She had a lover.
But she was very smart in business, so my sister and I invited her to join us in Yokosuka and she accepted.
She intended to run a hotel and found an intermediary to find one for her.
He found one and took my mother to see it.
She fell in love with it right away, because it was solidly built.
After buying it, she learned it had formerly been a bordello.
My mother said it wouldn't work as a hotel and decided to put some girls in it.
- What was it called?
- Misuzu.
LAW AGAINST PROSTITUTION
PASSED
Many women work in the streets.
They lead a miserable life.
A regular client of Misuzu committed suicide because of piled up debts.
It was your fault and your sister's,
I knew nothing about that hotel.
I bought it without knowing what it was.
You always blame others for your mistakes!
Who went to see the hotel?
Who fell in love with it?
I only bought it because I liked the property.
You lived in Yokosuka and didn't know
Yasuura was a red-light district?
It's impossible you didn't know!
MR. MIZUTANI AND HER MOTHER
From the start, that woman wanted to open a bordello.
- We have some problems, mama.
- No, it was nothing like that.
When you know you're doing something illegal, you think of the consequences if you get caught.
If you commit a crime you have to pay for it.
I knew this business wouldn't last, but I'd put a lot of money in it.
So I tried to make a lot in short time.
Sooner or later we'd be caught, 
I didn't hide anything of that work.
The authorities looked the other way and I concentrated on the business.
While running the hotel I heard of others that were denounced.
They were all being denounced, so
I decided to hurry to make money.
The authorities didn't care if 
I made a little or a lot.
For us it was more complicated, we also had American clients.
It was a Japanese-American market, others had just Japanese clients.
The clientele was Japanese-American, there were small fry and bigwigs.
Someone cried when they bit him!
It was a casbah.  They told me not to worry about the police.
But I replied it was my business alone.
I even protested when we help from a councilor.
You made me ashamed!
Basically we offered a place to meet, even if it wasn't clean work.
PHOTO REPORTAGE
With religious songs in almost military rhythm and passionate sutra prayers they found many proselytes.
At the time the Saka Gakkai sect was in fashion.
They insisted on inviting me into their organization.
I thought if what they were saying were true, no one in the world would suffer.
In that period I met one of my lovers.
We rented a room together, but I was always afraid my husband would come.  He came to the city often with a lover.
I was still married to him then.
He asked me for money saying he'd use it for photos.
He asked me for 150,000 yen to pay for film and developing.
I was very scared of him.
One day I went to a pub with an American soldier thinking my husband wouldn't come there.
My heart beats just remembering that moment!
While I was dancing with the Ameri- can I saw my husband in fury.
It was a big place, lots of people.
My husband dragged me out by my hair, everyone watched incredulous.
I felt shame, anger, sorrow.
I thought he'd kill me as soon as the taxi stopped.
He made me go from Mount Hara to in front of Saikei.
My husband didn't let go of my hand one instant.
- You dragged her.
- Yes, it was the only way.
But it wasn't just this!
If he'd discovered I was with a bar tender, he'd have denounced me.
At that point they convinced me to join Soka Gakkai.
They said I just had to join and my desires would come true, all suffering and sadness would vanish.
I wanted to separate from my husband, so I thought I'd join Soka Gakkai.
I can say I profited from Soka Gakkai.
My desire came true, even if it seems strange to someone.
Shimura came to me with the divorce form already filled out and asked me to sign it.
Then I joined Soka Gakkai.
One day I went to the person in charge of the female section.
She told me I'd succeed in the divorce by praying a lot, but that afterward I'd meet another man like Shimura.
Finally I would no longer have to endure my husband's blows and smacks.
I felt relieved, after getting the divorce.
Often I went out for fun with the bar tender.
We went to Tokyo, to Gora… that is, to Hakone.
I'd lots of fun with him.
At the end he behaved the same as my ex husband.
- The bar tender?
- Yes, he asked for money and beat me.
My friends said I was in a comfortable situation.
Now I wonder if it was really so.
She didn't give me money regularly.
She gave me it to live, 
I wasn't worried about that.
For some I was in the best situation, living without working.
The bar tender understand 
English well.
He spied in back of the curtain, when clients were talking.
I felt obsessed.
Finally I couldn't even speak with clients anymore.
If I did, he beat me and dragged me around by my hair.
From then I believe in 
Soka Gakkai.
I believe with them my desires will be fulfilled.
Someone looking from outside can't understand.
IMPERIAL WEDDING
April 10, 1959, under a clear sky, the hereditary married 
Miss Michiko.
My sister was also named Michiko, like this girl, with the same ideograms.
Two Michikos, but with different fates.
While my sister worked in a pub this girl was joining the imperial family.
I talked with my sister about the enormous difference.
A commoner married a member of the 
Imperial family.
Instead if we'd stayed home, we'd have a normal marriage with common people.
We said, "So much money shouldn't be spent like that.
It's a waste."
- You threw a stone.
- Yes.
They say that boy wasn't admitted to the university.
I think he was angry too, as I am now.
He wasn't admitted and this ceremony was too sumptuous, even if it was a wedding.
He was angry, I think.
Still today I feel angry.
Among the spectators were middleclass men and Americans.
Such thing had never happened.
To those who asked me about them, 
I said for us they were a decoration.
- They questioned you?
- Yes.
They asked me if they divinities, 
I replied no.
They asked me why there was so much opulence and I replied they were decorations, we left the decorations and cleaned up.
Everyone listened incredulous.
They asked how they live and I replied with the taxes we pay.
So they asked me why we pay, if then the money gets wasted for such sumptuous ceremonies.
I replied I didn't know.
I too wondered why.
NEW IMPERIAL PALACE
It cost 13.5 billion yen.
An enormity!  They already had a house, it wasn't necessary.
They could have given the money to an orphanage or charity.
People mobilized from anger and resentment.
There was agitation and strong protests.
Yes, they could build a 
13.5 billion yen house but this expense weighed too much on people, so they protested.
BLOOD-SOAKED JAPANESE-AMERICAN 
SECURITY TREATY
Bloody clashes, wounded fall in mud.
More than 400 wounded on both sides.
Among the demonstrators also a female university student.
Michiko Kanda arrived dead at the hospital.
This death brought the anger of the demonstrators to such height,
that they burned the police truck.
We often discussed these events.
We said it wasn't possible to die for 1000 yen, more or less.
You think she died for this?
No she was only a student.
She was young, she'd fallen from inexperience, I thought.
But the Yokosuka demonstrators didn't seem to me like her, they also said: "Yankee, go home!"
The news said they demonstrated in Tokyo against the Japanese-American security treaty.
But in Yokosuka they said
"Yankee, go home."
People wanted to get rid of the 
American base in Yokosuka.
A few were against the treaty and many for sending away the "Yankee."
- Go away!
- Get out of Japan!
It's a terrible reception for Mr Haggerty.
Even a military helicopter sent to help had problems landing.
Mr Haggerty and General MacArthur
finally manager to get through the crowd.
Some 300,000 demonstrators from all over Japan
are arriving at the 
Parliament building.
Let's dissolve Parliament!
The demonstrators march in order toward the Parliament.
Liberal-Democrat Parliamentarians escorted President Kiyose.
The situation hasn't yet stabilized...
Your daughter Akemi was still little at the time.
She was 10 maybe.
Let me thin… Yes, she was 10.
She'd come from our hometown, begun school since half a year.
- She didn't go?
- Yes.
I was living with the bar tender, and my daughter wasn't happy.
I didn't like that man.
- Why?
- He was intrusive.
He bothered me.
I west to live with my mother after my parents' divorce.
I was very happy not to see my father anymore.
- But that man intruded.
- In what sense?
He'd order me to do this and that and I wasn't even his daughter.
He'd present me to others as his daughter which I didn't like.
When my daughters came to live with me my relations with the bar tender worsened.
At 10 my daughter started playing hooky from school.
She'd no friends, school was no fun for her.
She wasn't going every day but I didn't realize it because she'd go out every morning.
She wasn't going to school.
What did she do when she didn't go to school?
She'd go to our place or some other nearby to play.
I was worried for my mother, 
I feared she'd get beaten.
Why?
My father would come often to Yokosuka to ask my mother for money.
I didn't like seeing these scenes, I was worried
I wasn't going to school so I could watch over my mother.
I'd hide in the kitchen and watch.
If my mother told him she didn't have money, my father would beat her.
So she'd give him money.
Eventually the bar tender too behaved this way.
My mother didn't love me much because I looked like my father, but it wasn't my fault.
When I didn't go to school, mother would say to me,
"You're like your father in everything you do."
You weren't happy to hear her say this?
No, I was offended.
One day I asked her what I could do not to look like him.
She replied I couldn't do anything, it was a question of blood.
I decided to father my father with a knife.
- With a knife?
- Yes.
What happened?
The girls at the place saw me and stopped me.
One time a similar scene occurred, they made the knives disappear.
Akemi looked like my ex husband,
I didn't love her as much as Mami or Chieko.
She reminded me of my ex, made me mad, didn't even listen to me.
You still act this way, mama.
You make problems for me, my daughter!
Even if mama didn't notice, she said certain things to me because I looked like papa.
They looked as alike as two drops of water.
For this reason my daughter Emiko doesn't love my granddaughter, she doesn't cuddle her and she's jealous.
The other daughter, Mami, looks like her, so she likes her.
She's always trying to make her happy.
Now and then I feel unsatisfied.
I wonder if I was right to separate them from their father.
I wonder if they feel alone and abandoned because of me.
It's the terrible moment of the attack.
The terrorist was caught in front of Prime Minister Ikeda.
For serious events the meeting was interrupted!
The corpse returns to the apartment where the man lived 30 years.
The Prime Minister, after witnessing the assassination,
prays at the altar.
I like "Osho" among Japanese songs.
As soon as I hear it
I feel sad and cry a lot.
They have the record only in the place we go to drink.
I like the song because the protagonist came from country to city like me and worked so much without asking others for help.
I came to Tokyo,
have to win at any cost.
How the Tsutenkaku Tower shines,
my courage to fight shines too.
I told my sister: "Michiko, you don't have relations with Japanese men. you don't know their worth.  Try staying with a Japanese man."
She replied, "You say that because you love Japanese men, even if you say you'd had enough of them."
With passage of time the bartender stopped working and starter asking me for money.
He had no limits, he was always moving around.
Finally he became like Shimura, my ex-husband.
I was tired of this story.
I didn't like Japanese men anymore.
I no longer looked for 
Japanese men.
My little sister happily married a man from Kyoto in a traditional ceremony.
It was a classic wedding.
My sister didn't work and had a optimal husband.
I who worked hard hadn't managed to establish myself well.
Maybe I was envious.
I wondered why it had to happen exactly to me who worked hard.
It wasn't a good idea to go on looking for a Japanese man.
So I began to save money.
At the time among the clients of the place was Ken.
He'd been coming for 7 months.
At first sight
Ken seemed very nice.
He must have been an officer.
He was very elegant.
He was a client from some time, often danced with me.
He didn't seem a simple soldier.
I thought I'd put him to the test.
- How did he behave?
- He wasn't very able socially, maybe he didn't have time for it, he didn't use particular techniques.
I don't say we was trying particular techniques!
He'd give two bangs and finish quickly.
People had told me foreigners were very tenacious.
Maybe he was too excited.
The first time with me he came immediately to orgasm.
AMERICAN PRESIDENT 
KENNEDY ASSASSINATED
November 22, 1963...
Where were you that day?
With Ken, I was with him.
How did Ken react?
The President was very loved by the American soldiers.
They wondered what the future would be after the death of someone so important. They were shocked.
Ken said something but didn't feel directly involved.
- After Ken?
- After Ken I knew Jean.
He was a sailor.
He said when his ship came back to port he'd marry me.
He went off with his ship for two and a half months.
He had the right to an indemnity when he was in service, so I calculated how much money he'd have when he came back.
But the money was less than 
I'd expected.
I got angry and left Jean.
- After Jean?
- After Jean... Robert.
He was part of KDU, a group of 16 or 17 people who made small bombers for missiles launched from ships.
They were training planes.
You started with him around 1964?
- Yes, 1964.
What was Robert like?
He was thin, small, looked intelligent.
He was intelligent.
He was always studying, with books.
My place was quite thriving then.
So I didn't go there often,
I had fun going bowling.
I got pregnant.
- Chieko is Robert's daughter?
- Yes.
He went back to America after Chieko's birth?
Afterward… She was born in 
January, he left in June.
He was with his daughter five months.
- You knew he'd go home?
- Yes, we'd talked about it.
- Chieko wouldn't have a father.
- I knew that.
NUCLEAR AIRCRAFT CARRIER 
DOCKS AT SASEBO.
It's the morning of January 19,
the Enterprise looks like a little mountain.
It's 341 meters long,
It's the world's largest nuclear aircraft carrier with 8 motors.
- After Robert?
- Joe.
- How long did Joe last?
- I stayed with Joe 3 years.
It was a longer relationship than the others.
Yes, because my daughter was very affectionate with him.
Joe had divorced after the birth of a daughter, he'd been married.
- To a Japanese?
- No, a foreigner.
His daughter was Chieko's age, that's why he pampered her.
He watched her when I worked, took her for trips in the car.
Chieko thought he was her father.
She still thinks so.
- After Joe?
- After Joe was Mojo.
His name was Mojo?
Mojo said his mother was Indian.
Mojo crewed on a submarine, he only came twice a year.
He was a strange boy.
He wasn't refined and drank a lot.
I cried a lot.
I cried because he didn't care for me and went always with another woman.
- The soldiers didn't talk about it?
- No, they were intelligent.
- You made love with others?
- Yes, for work.
You didn't do it just for money?
If rapport was natural, 
I didn't ask for money.
Mojo west back to his country 
November 17, 1967.
What did you do then?
A ship had just arrived called Puebro.
Chuck came often.
Often, after relations with Chuck,
I asked him what ship he was on, but he didn't answer.
He'd bring along so many friends, there were lots of men on the ship.
I saw 80 people with rather high ranks.
I said to Chuck, "I saw high-ranking men in your ship.
Maybe they're spies." He didn't reply, tried to change subject.
Then, I think January 5, the ship left.
- It was 1968?
- Yes. After came the news they'd stopped an American ship in the Sea of Japan.
They talked about it a lot on radio and television.
I thought immediately of Chuck's ship, it was his ship.
- They arrested him?
- Yes.
That's him!
- First man on the right?
- Yes, the fat one.
There he is!
He'd the third standing.
The one looking away.
It was really him.
- He was a stout man.
- Yes, really!
WAR IN VIETNAM INTENSIFIES
Soldiers of the Vietnam government and the Americans
have attacked the Vietcong.
The combatants have advanced as far as the president's residence.
Marine came in support, firing has been intense.
Was there a hospital at the American base?
Yes.
- Were you there?
- Yes, to see a friend recovering.
Soldiers coming from Vietnam are sent there.
There were no wounded solders.
It was a psychiatric hospital.
I saw a soldier open a drawer, lift up a mattress.
When my friend asked him what he was doing, he replied,
"I'm looking for my ears."
He looked everywhere, rummaged through books, in drawers, took off the linen, the blankets.
My friend told him they were in their place, but he didn't listen.
- Where was the hospital?
- It was... over there.
Recently there was a massacre in Sonmi.
- Did you hear talk of it?
- No, I didn't.
There're photos of the massacre in the magazine "Asahi Graph."
I can't believe a thing like that.
There are the photos.
I can't believe a thing like that, if I don't see it with my own eyes.
I can't trust games of chance, if I can't put my hand on the bet.
I only believe what I see with my eyes.
You don't believe photos?
Those who write for magazines live on what they write.
So I guess what they write is more or less exaggerated.
I can't believe them.
The Americans are too upright to commit these atrocities.
I had Japanese clients too, but the Americans are nicer than the Japanese.
I can't believe Americans did a massacre.
War drives humans insane.
In a fight someone wins and someone loses.
In a fight someone kills and someone is killed.
It's wrong to start a war.
War makes victims of civilians, also of children.
They took photos after gathering children killed, they got the bodies deliberately.
I can't believe these photos.
That's the hospital.
Chieko is Robert's daughter.
It was a difficult decision to bear a half-cast child.
I don't think so, it wasn't a difficult decision.
When I was in my 3rd or 4th month of pregnancy, my parents came from home.
Mama realized immediately, not papa.
After a month even papa realized it and told my mother I should abort.
Mama told me papa was furious and I should abort.
I trusted mama more,
I could speak more easily with her and I refused.
She asked me to talk to papa and he said,
"You'll be disinherited if you give birth to a baby with blue eyes.
You won't be able to come home even if I'm sick or dying."
I couldn't talk frankly with papa, so I said to mama,
"I've sacrificed for the house, maybe I've done nothing for you, but I've always obeyed you.
Sometimes I do what I want.
No one can stop me."
It was an absurd situation, everyone was against it.
I was stubborn despite everyone,
I said I wouldn't do it.
It was normal for our parents to be against giving birth to a half-cast baby.
If she'd been married like his sister, she'd have had everyone's blessing.
They'd have celebrated the birth of a half-cast baby.
Instead in her case the parents wouldn't accept the baby.
Were you pregnant by Ken or Jean?
No, neither.
It was after Jean,
I was pregnant by Robert.
I was 36 then.
I wasn't young anymore, it would be the last pregnancy.
Till then I'd made only sacrifices.
I wanted to what I wanted, so I decider to have the baby.
Did you want to have the baby because it was an American's?
No, nothing to do with that.
I didn't care if it was a 
Japanese's or an American's.
After the abortion of the bar tender's baby
I'd not gotten pregnant, I was resigned to not having more children.
I was filled with joy at being a woman and seeing my stomach grow.
So I went ahead with the pregnancy.
- You like children?
- Yes, I do.
They're my reason for existing.
My daughter is black.
Not to boast, but she's very intelligent.
She speaks Japanese well.
She's wimpy, Alica.  Why do you want to give her good education?
Education?
She's going to elementary school.
Yes, but at the 
American school.
I'd like her to go to university too.  If she succeeds there…
You want to have her study so that others respect her even if she's black?
I also have a 5-year old, but I don't interfere in her life.
Parents shouldn't influence their children.
I keep after her closely.
The vice of Japanese mamas is to make their study too much.
We want to make them study even if they don't like to.
If you don't watch them enthusiastically, they don't study.
They achieve results thanks only to tour efforts.
AVORIO TOWER DESTROYED 
AT TOKYO UNIVERSITY
It would be mere be the fruit of the parents' vanity.
At least Akemi and Mami will be find place with good families.
They've finished high school, but their education isn't considered that great.
Why do you say a thing like that, mama?
Whether Japanese or foreigner today it's difficult to finish middle school.
Study is the parents' responsibility.
In February 1967 my sister Michiko married Franky, an American soldier.
He wasn't a common solider, he was an officer.
Unlike me my sister deeply believed in Soka Gakkai.
She prayed with Soka Gakkai to be able to marry an important man like a lawyer, a doctor or a pilot.
She prayed a lot at the altar, she looked half asleep.
Others said she was doing prostitution, in fact she worked a lot, she'd bought a house, was running a shop and, finally, had found the husband she wanted.
I feel much esteem and envy for her.
But sister told me not to look for a common sailor but for an officer, even if he's old.
I tried to have an affair with an officer, but it was a strain.
He'd tell me not to laugh, to keep quiet.
I had to walk without making noise.
At the end I was too tired.
"Never again with an officer!"
I said.
My sister, even after settling in the United States, wrote me my daughters should choose an officer, if they wanted to marry an 
American soldier.
A common soldier earns little, as much as a Japanese construction worker.
What do you think of your sister Michiko's opinion?
For me it's unbearable.
My sister and her husband behave the same way.
With my companion I talk about everything, even erotic issues.
We understand each other, laugh about things and don't think we shouldn't say things because it might disturb others.
My brother-in-law Frank doesn't want her to say obscene things, or to walk swaying her hips, or to eat so much she gets fat.
He tells her to ride bicycle for an hour or do some other sport.
And my sister obeys him, she dose what he says.
Franky is Germany and Michiko Japanese, oriental.
Franky feels inferior to other Americans.
He doesn't watt a life full of sacrifices, he wants a quiet life.
When I tell my daughters to choose an officer they answer,
"Stop it!  We don't want to!"
Akemi is with a low-ranking sailor, who dose petty jobs.  He likes it.
I don't choose a man for his work.
I don't care if the work he does is more noble or less,
I choose him for his character, his personality.
They don't understand me.
- For you it's enough that he work.
- Yes.
My companion work a lot and brings home everything he earns.
I prefer a man who works diligently, that's enough for me, but my relatives don't agree.
They don't want me to have a man like that.
Is you father interested in what others think?
Yes. He is. 
Men are all the same.
- For you even he's like that?
- Yes. When I'm depressed...
- You man consoles you?
- Yes. I like that a lot.
NUCLEAR SUBMARINE SNUCK
AT PORT OF YOKOSUKA
The nuclear submarine Snuck has entered the port of Yokosuka.
Around the American base the atmosphere had become heavy.
There were hospitals like 
Joseph's full of wounded!
People who went just to see, not to demonstrate, got involved and wounded.
Many people participated.
I was afraid, I didn't go out of the house.
I saw ambulances pass by with the wounded.
We had to keep the shops closed, we said we wouldn't be able to live in Yokosuka anymore.
There were many demonstrations,
My daughter Akemi was almost always going to my mother's bar.
My mother phoned me often from there asking if my daughter was alive.
When Akemi wasn't with me, 
I waited for her anxiously.
Once she disappeared for some time.
I looked for her at my mother's, she said she'd sent her with a soldier to the military base to buy something.
Next day Mrs Barbara came with my daughter to my house.
She said Akemi had gone to her house because she was afraid to have contracted a disease through sexual relations.
I was very shocked by these words!
Compared to this, I didn't care in the least if my husband went to bed with another woman in my house!
I felt as thought I'd been hit hard on my head.
I couldn't believe it.
I went to my daughter's room, she was downcast.
I said, "You can't catch that kind of disease without having sexual relations.
What did you do?"
My daughter didn't reply and I said,
"Have you had relations with a man?"
She didn't reply, didn't deny, 
I was sure she'd had relations.
She still wouldn't answer, so 
I got mad and struck her.
I asked her, "When did it happen?"
She replied, "Yesterday."
My daughter had made a mistake.
She'd lost her virginity, and thought she'd caught a disease because she didn't feel well.
Then I cried a lot.
Crying, I told my daughter I'd gone to live with her father without marrying him.
I told her I'd wanted to see her get married in a wedding gown with a man from a good family, even if I were poor and alone.
I was crying without stop also because I was pregnant and felt nervous.
I asked my daughter Akemi what she intended to do.
She replied she'd like to work in a shop and earn a living.
I asked immediately where she'd go work, she was very young.
I thought it was better to keep her close to me.
She was 15 then, maybe just 14.
It was in October.
If my daughter had lost her virginity while she was with me,
I wouldn't have reason to complain.
I had sent her to my mother's, because she liked staying with grandmother.
It can happen even when parents keep a close eye on their children.
Things happen.
She was 14.
She wasn't going to school anymore, she felt grown-up.
Maybe it happened because 
I felt alone and that man seemed so nice.
I'd known him for a year, I went to the movies with him and his friends
They came of to the "Candy" club.
I'd become friendly with him.
My aunt Michiko's fiancé was his commanding officer.
That day I met him and so it went.
My mother would have liked to see me married with a man from a good family.
I think that's something difficult to achieve, difficult, let's say, in my condition.
Concerning tour current husband,
Hoery Kimmer.
- When did you meet him?
- I met him in 1962, he used to come often to my club, the "Omboro."
I let him sleep there two or three times, but without having relations with him.
He didn't pay court to me,
I found him different from other men.
In April 1964 I started having relations with him.
At the beginning I wasn't desperately in love with him.
Then all of a sudden his ship was to go to Vietnam.
He left thinking he'd come back to Yokosuka, instead he west back to the 
United States.
He wrote me a letter saying he'd saved up some money, would come get me, and to prepare my passport.
I didn't believe him because a soldier at home can say anything.
Hoery came back to Japan at the end of November.
He'd saved $1500.
- Where did you get married?
- In America, in Las Vegas.
Hoery thought I was 36 0r 37.
I was afraid because of my age and asked him if it were a problem.
He replied age didn't matter. Now too he tells me not to worry about it.
He's sweet!
I was telling him again the other day, in our family we're all contrary, he's a man with little foresight.
When my daughter is 50, he'll be just 30.
I don't think a foreigner can stay married with a woman older than he.
- His daughter will return to Japan?
- Yes, she will.
Weren't there other reasons for going to live in America?
I'm sick of dealing with my people, my relatives.
But even if I'd like to,
I can't cut them off definitively.
But by going far away I don't have to hang out with them anymore.
That's why I decided to leave.
JAPANESE AIRLINES 
PLANE HIJACKED
To tell the truth, 
I wasn't obliged to marry him.
But that's how things went.
I knew another man, named Joe, who also asked me to marry him, but he didn't convince me.
- But for me it was the same.
- It was enough he was American?
Yes, I preferred an American.  I wanted American citizenship.
Citizenship could help me, so it wasn't necessary that it be specifically Hoery.
Yesterday I went to Tachikawa.
Now it's not what it used to be, nor does the Yokosuka base have a future.
I've earned enough.
With this money I can make more in international circles.
America is big.
Even with a little capital, I can achieve big results, but I'm human, I can make mistakes.
I could go back to Japan without money, but I don't want to.
They say it's easier to run a bar in America than in Japan.
It's not necessary to supply the girls, you just need two or three bar tenders, the girls will come on their own.
The license to sell whisky seems very expensive to me.
I could request the license from the authorities and then sell it.
I intend to study this possibility in America
Yokosuka is a city of sailors.
Many are looking for an apartment to rent.
If I had 30 apartments to rent for $150 each.
I'd make $4500 a month.
Will the madam of the Omboro look for another man in America?
Me?
My husband is young, maybe someday he'll want to leave me, I don't know when.
I don't know if I'll find another, maybe yes, if a good chance comes by.
Hoery is young and I think he'll find another woman.
What would you do?
In that case, I'd separate from him.
I wouldn't like to, but 
I'd divorce him, keeping what's due me.
Whatever happens, I shan't give up till I become an American citizen.
When everything's mine,
I'll outwit him.
- You'd go back to Japan?
- I think not.
I think I'd do business with old Americans.
I don't want to go back without having succeeded.
Don't you ever get tired of looking for men?
No, I tell everyone,
I want to have relations till I'm dead, until I have enough money to buy young men too/
Until I'm dead, I shan't stop loving someone.
I don't want to have less success than my mother.
I'm happy the club is mine now, but I want clients who are mine alone.
I want to see how well I can do.
I want to surpass my mother.
I wonder if I won't end up hating my mother by wanting to surpass her.
I'd like a quiet moment to look inside myself and to look after the people around me.

Follow me. Come around so we can get the general.
[ Prisoners Cheering ]
- So good to see you, General.
- Finally returned, but a little late.
- So good to see you.
- Thank you.
Get me some more shots of these people.
- Hello, sonny.
- Aah.
You know, I've got a boy at home just about your size.
I have. Here we are.
[ Man ]
Once more, General.
Survivors of the death march are in here.
[ Cheering ]
- It is him.
- [ Clapping, Chattering ]
[ Coughing ]
General, you really made it back.
Oh, I'm never gonna forget this.
- We're long overdue, sir. Long overdue.
- It's okay.
- We knew you'd come back, sir.
We knew you wouldn't forget us.
- Thank you.
We're a little late.
I'm sorry.
Colonel Fox here, sir.
We're sure glad to see you, sir.
- We're a little late. I'm sorry.
- Yes, sir.
General? General?
[ Coughing ]
General?
Thank God you're here.
We're long overdue.
Long overdue.
- Castro!
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry I'm so unpresentable, sir.
You never looked so good to me, Castro.
Ladies and gentlemen... if you've ever had a load of hay fall on you... then you know how I feel right now.
I don't know if any of you pray, but if you do, you could pray God to help me.
[ Man ]
Good luck, Mr President.
I wish you didn't have to call me that.
I never felt so out of place in all my life.
[ Man On Radio ] Here is the caisson of Franklin Delano Roosevelt... now making the turn off of 1 5th Street... into Pennsylvania Avenue.
God give me strength to do this.
And there is the flag-draped coffin.
The horses with black blankets under their saddles.
The horses on the right side... unmounted.
And it's moving ever so slowly... as the crowd stands... to pay their last respects... to the man who was their leader, their commander in chief... their friend.
- Mr President.
- Hello, General.
- We need your authorization.
- What do you got?
Well, the president--
Mr Roosevelt never told me.
They never told me.
We spent months of staff time... tens of millions of dollars in preparation... for the greatest invasion in history... and when we're primed and ready... they send an air force officer... to tell me they've constructed this-this apparatus!
General, what happens if it doesn't work?
What happens if it does?
- [ Knocking ]
- Yes?
Excuse me.
Admiral Halsey, the representatives are all on board, sir.
The British commander of Singapore has just been released from a prison camp.
Percival. Good, good.
What about that Russian fellow?
General Derevyanko.
He's here.
[ Chuckles ]
What gall!
The Soviets declared war after we'd won it, and now they want to horn in on the surrender.
There's someone else here too, sir.
General.
Jim.
- General.
-Jim!
I'm so glad to see you.
General Wainwright,
I don't think you know Admiral Halsey.
- Welcome aboard, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
-Jonathan. Good to see you.
- Yes, of course.
And Admiral Nimitz.
- General.
- Admiral.
Come and sit down,Jim.
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't talk like that.
- I've disgraced you and the army.
- You have not. That's not true.
- We were starving.
- You don't have to say anything,Jim.
I had to shoot my horse.
I realize they'll never restore me to active duty.
That's not true,Jim.
You can have whatever you want.
Command of a corps.
That's all I want.
Your old corps is yours whenever you're ready, General.
[ Camera Shutter Clicking ]
- Sid.
- Yes, sir?
What did I do with Jean's pen?
Here we go, sir.
[ MacArthur ]
We are gathered here... representatives of the major warring powers... to conclude a solemn agreement whereby peace may be restored.
The issues have been determined upon the battlefields of the world... and hence are not for our discussion or debate.
The representative of the emperor ofJapan... and of theJapanese Imperial
General Headquarters... now sign the instrument of surrender.
General Sutherland, will you show him where to sign, please?
The supreme commander of the Allied powers... will now sign on behalf of all the nations at war with Japan.
Will Generals Percival and Wainwright come forward, please?
[ Foghorn Blasts ]
The representative of the United States of America will now sign.
The representative of the Republic of China will now sign.
The representative of the United Kingdom will now sign.
The representative of Canada will now sign.
The representative of France--
The representative of Australia will now sign.
The representative of the Netherlands will now sign.
The representative of New Zealand will now sign.
The representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics... will now sign.
Today... the guns are silent.
A great tragedy has ended.
I speak... for the thousands of silent lips forever stilled... among the jungles and the beaches... and in the deep waters of the Pacific... which marked the way.
I pray... that an omnipotent Providence... will summon all persons of goodwill... to the realization of the utter futility of war.
We have known the bitterness of defeat... the exultation of triumph, and from both we have learned... that there can be no turning back.
We must go forward to preserve in peace... what we won in war.
The destructiveness of the war potential... through progressive advances in scientific discovery... has in fact now reached a point... which revises the traditional concept of war.
War... the most malignant scourge... and greatest sin of mankind... can no longer be controlled, only abolished.
We are in a new era.
If we do not devise... some greater and more equitable means... of settling disputes between nations...
Armageddon will be at our door.
We have had our last chance.
[ MacArthur ]
Court, I want you to tell Washington that I'm transferring food... and medical supplies to theJapanese authorities.
- Yes, sir.
- The next priority is to get those men home... get them to work rebuilding this country.
I don't know.
In terms of communication, transport, industrial plant, there isn't any country.
Yeah, well, they'll have to build a new one.
A new Japan with new ideas...
- but preserving the best of the old.
- Yes, sir.
All of our troops will be judged by me... for their conduct as men and as soldiers.
I want them to understand that the Japanese... must be treated with courtesy and respect.
Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon... all failed as occupiers of conquered countries... because of the harshness of their policies.
I do not intend to fail.
We're coming up on the palace now.
I wonder whether it wouldn't be a good idea... to summon the emperor to explain your policies.
Show of authority to the Japanese people.
No. After a lifetime of studying the Oriental mind...
I can tell you that I must not directly challenge... the authority of the emperor.
He lives there in that palace across that moat, half-god, half-king.
His decrees limit the degree of each man's freedom.
His word is absolute.
The time will come when Hirohito, of his own volition... will cross that moat and come to me... and that will mark the beginning of the end... of his absolute power over the Japanese people.
[ Crowd Chattering ]
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Court.
Morning, gentlemen. I've been going over these additional suggestions... from the State Department on the occupation.
I have to work them in with our own task force recommendations.
General Marquet, what's happening with land reform?
The landowners are having difficulty with their tenant farmers.
Oh, they are? I don't want to ever hear the word ''tenant farmer'' again.
I want these privileged landowners stripped of their holdings.
- We'll break up these great estates.
- Yes, sir, but--
They've been squeezing the farmers dry far too long.
But, sir, they're very strong.
[ Chuckles ]
They may not be as strong as they think.
And the right-wing industrialists are the fellows who led this country to ruin.
I want them expunged.
''Expunged, ''sir?
Don't you think that you--
All in the best possible legal language, of course.
[ All Chuckle ]
I want to see a labour movement take root.
- Labour movement?
- That's right.
The workers must have a strong voice in the means of production.
General, pardon me, but this reminds me somewhat of--
- Well, it's like--
- Like what?
Like the New Deal.
Ah. Well, this is Japan, not America.
But considering her fascist past... it might be good to move her just a little left of centre, don't you agree?
- Yes, sir.
- Of course, we wouldn't call it the New Deal.
- No, sir.
- [ Laughs ]
Now.
-Japanese women.
- What about them?
- They must be given the vote.
- [ Whistles ]
- The men are not gonna like that.
- Neither did our men at first.
General, I'm sorry, but it's too much to expect a feudal country likeJapan... to swallow a whole new constitution in one gulp.
Their cabinet will never go for it.
The old cabinet wouldn't, but we've yet to hear from the new prime minister.
[ MacArthur ]
And may I congratulate you on your appointment, Mr Shidehara.
Thank you.
General, I extend to you my gratitude... for the penicillin your medical services made available to me.
It aided me in recovering from a serious illness.
Happy to be of assistance.
Diseases are conquered, sir... even very old, epidemic diseases.
- Yes?
- Sometimes, though... the cure is slow and painful.
Yes, of course.
Is there some particular difficulty?
General, our new constitution... must forbid any military establishment in Japan whatsoever.
There must not be an army... a navy or an air force.
We must renounce now and forever... the use of force as an instrument of national power.
- Mr Prime Minister, I can only--
- Please. Hear me out.
Of course.
In this way... and only this way... can we eliminate forever... the power of the militarists.
Only in this way... can we reassure the world that Japan... no longer has warlike design against any people.
We are a poor country... with 70 million person to feed and clothe.
We cannot afford armaments.
We cannot afford the trapping of power.
And never, never again can we suffer...
Nagasaki and Hiroshima.
Let us renounce war, sir.
Please.
Let us renounce war in the new constitution... and forever.
Mr Shidehara... no man detests war... more than this soldier.
My abhorrence for it reached its height... with the development of the atom bomb.
No man, sir, could be more moved by your offer... or more determined to accept it.
It's damned embarrassing.
I've been telling Congress for months we need 400,000 men in Japan.
MacArthur holds a press conference, says he can make do with half that number.
- General, did he clear this with you?
- No, sir.
- There's been some misunderstanding.
- Not by me there isn't.
I invited MacArthur to come home. I wanted to discuss occupation policy with him... and I expected him to back up our position before the congressional committees.
So I held out the big carrot to him.
I told him we'd set up a series of welcome-home demonstrations and a joint session of congress.
You know what he replied?
He said he thought the situation was just too dangerous there for him to come home right now.
He was just too busy.
That's what he said to the president of the United States, damn it!
[ MacArthur Chuckling ]
General Derevyanko,
I must say...
I've missed you.
Only short visit to Moscow, a meeting with my superiors... a holiday on Caspian Sea with family.
Good. I was afraid that Stalin had had you shot.
No, no.
Why do you say that?
Would Truman have you shot?
Sometimes I wonder.
General, it's come to my attention that several hundreds of thousands... of Japanese prisoners fell into your hands... in the closing days of the war.
You understand that the Japanese authorities... and my own superiors as well are pressing me for an accounting.
Ah, we have some small numbers of enemy troops in our hands, that is true.
But I can assure that in this matter, as you know... my government will abide by the decisions of the Potsdam Conference.
Yes. When will they be repatriated?
Soon.
[ Chuckles ]
In that connection, my government is making plans... for the occupation of Hokkaido Island.
Hokkaido Island is occupied.
It is under my command.
The Soviet Union is a coequal ally.
It is my government's intention... to occupy Hokkaido on its own behalf.
As the supreme commander,
I represent all Allied powers.
We are fully prepared to commence our rightful occupation... whether you approve or not.
You see, the terms of my command are absolute.
This is not Germany.
I will not countenance separate spheres of influence or occupation... of the home islands of Japan as long as I'm in command.
Well, then, sir, my government... will insist upon a new supreme commander.
If the day comes when Soviet troops... attempt to land on Japanese soil without my expressed consent...
I will throw the entire
Soviet delegation in Tokyo into jail.
Including you...
General Derevyanko.
I believe you would.
And I believe this is where you get off.
[ Man Narrating Newsreel ]
As the historic changes continue to transform Japanese life... it was becoming evident this week that the women of Japan... were winning their fight to end family contract marriages... the right to equal cigarette and sake rations... and the right to vote.
Dress fashions are not the only thing that have changed radically.
In the newly established election,
1 3 million women went to the polls... and in an unprecedented sweep, elected 38 women lawmakers... to the House of Representatives.
[ Man ] I regret to say something terrible has happened.
A prostitute, Your Excellency... has been elected to ''House of Representative.''
- Prostitute?
- How many votes did she receive?
She must have an unusually loyal clientele.
[ Newsreel Narrator ] Now, after two and a half years of painstaking work... the War Crimes trial in Tokyo comes to an end.
As America prepares for another presidential election year...
Japan celebrates 1 948... with the first anniversary of its new constitution.
Mmm... not these.
- I think this one's the best.
- I thought you might like that one.
[ Chuckling ]
That's fine.
Court, what time is it in Wisconsin?
- I can never figure out--
- Polls closed an hour ago, and I wish I had been there.
- I would have had one of these on every lamppost.
- No, you don't, Pick.
No electioneering within
50 feet of the candidate.
Why, General, you're not a candidate.
Just another available citizen.
Excuse me, General, but I'm from Wisconsin... and my folks are voting for you.
- Matter of fact, I would be too, only I'm not old enough.
- Well, thank you, son.
All the precincts?
This just came in on the wire.
You only won eight delegates.
Eight delegates out of 2 7.
It's their loss, General.
You would have made a great president.
Well... what's on the calendar for today?
- [ Laughter ]
- [ Man ] Here's to four more years, Mr President!
[ Group ]
Hear! Hear!
[ Group ]
Happy days are here again
The skies above are clear again
So let's sing a song of cheer again
Happy days are here again
All together shout it now
There's no one who can doubt it now
So let's tell the world about it now
Happy days--
[ Newsreel Narrator ]
Roaring their approval here at the 1 949 Tokyo World Series.
The Giants are the heavy favourites this year.
Meanwhile, as the Japanese economy continued its painful but steady recovery... the mood of the nation began to reflect the growing cultural change.
[ Swing ]
[ Cancan ]
[ Ringing ]
- Yes?
- [ Man ] General, I'm sorry to disturb you at this late hour.
We have a dispatch from South Korea.
The North Koreans have struck in great strength across the boundary at the 38th parallel.
- In great strength?
- Yes, sir.
[ MacArthur ] Assemble the staff.
I'll be there presently.
Why, General, what's happened?
One last gift to an old warrior.
[ Truman ] My fellow Americans, tonight we face a serious situation.
On the advice of the best military minds I could muster...
I have decided to commit United States ground forces to the Korean peninsula.
We are not at war.
Acting in concert with our United Nations allies... we are engaged in a police action to counteract... a bandit raid into South Korea by North Korean communists.
[ Distant Explosions ]
Would you like to use my binoculars, sir?
No, thank you.
I've seen all I have to see.
General, what happens next, sir?
My father was asked that same question... when he found himself surrounded in the Civil War.
He said, ''The situation is simple and apparent.
''The enemy is closing on me from three sides... and my plan is to fight like hell.''
[ Male TV Announcer ]
Now, with the threat of annihilation temporarily forestalled...
MacArthur pays a worried visit to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek... leader of the Nationalist
Chinese on Formosa.
[ Truman ] Son of a bitch, that's a goose step they're doing.
[ Announcer ] Here it is felt the foundation is being constructed... for Sino-American military cooperation.
Damn it! Didn't we send MacArthur to Formosa to do just the opposite?
Call off Chiang and tell him he couldn't send his troops into mainland China or anywhere?
We didn't send him over there to forge his own personal alliances.
Hell, that sounds like we're concluding some kind of mutual defence treaty.
Mr Secretary, I want you to radio a message to His Majesty MacArthur.
What's the matter with them back there?
Have they lost their nerve?
I know all about Chiang.
If he had two horns and a tail... we should use him as long as he's anticommunist.
We can reform him later.
It's my destiny to defeat communism... and only God or those Washington politicians will keep me from doing it.
[ Truman ]
You didn't read this one, did you?
It's a letter to the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
''Nothing could be more fallacious than the threadbare argument...
''by those who advocate appeasement and defeatism in the Pacific...
''that if we defend Formosa, we alienate continental Asia.
Signed, Douglas MacArthur.''
You hear that?
Appeasement. Defeatism.
That's me he's talking about. Alvin, can you explain why he's done this?
No, Mr President,
I'm afraid I can't.
Did any of you know in advance this letter was gonna be printed?
I want it withdrawn right now.
Good morning, General.
Whitney.
I haven't seen that pipe in a long time.
In looking over your positions this morning, General Walker...
I saw that plans are afoot to conduct retrograde movements and abandon the perimeter.
Effective immediately, these plans will be scrapped.
The present line will be held.
We don't have any perimeters, General.
Just a few scattered strong points.
As soon as I put out one fire, another two get started.
I know that you're outnumbered in this thing, but sending you more troops... so you can hang on to this little corner of Korea... is not good enough.
Well, I'll settle for a regimental combat team.
Can't do it, Walt.
We need every man we've got.
General Shepherd... is putting together an overwhelming amphibious assault on Inchon.
- Inchon?
- In one stroke, it'll cut across the enemy's rear... sever his supply lines and isolate all of his forces south of Seoul.
Without munitions, supplies, communications... the North Koreans will be paralyzed.
- Inchon is the worst--
- Then you can break out of that corner... move north and overpower them.
I think that Inchon will finish the North Koreans.
- What?
- It'll never be approved.
[ Man ] Inchon has some of the highest tides in the world... but only once a month do they reach a height... sufficient for our largest landing craft to go in.
There are maybe two three-hour periods... when MacArthur can put troops ashore.
Which is not enough time for a major amphibious landing.
Exactly. This is little more than a trench in the mudflats.
If every possible handicap were listed, Inchon has them all.
However, gentlemen, MacArthur claims that these very handicaps are what he's counting on.
He feels that the enemy won't believe that anyone... would try to surmount such obstacles.
The element of surprise will be his most valuable ally.
What do you think of His Majesty's plan?
It's daring, it's brilliant and it's dangerous.
Court, you remember
I once said...
''The bullet has not yet been cast with my name on it''?
I certainly do.
Inchon could be that bullet.
There's 70,000 men out there... waiting to hit Inchon.
As of this moment, the president has not personally approved this mission.
The last communication I had from the joint chiefs... said that he'd been ''informed.''
He vacillated, delayed.
Finally gave begrudging permission... to proceed here.
Powerful enemies, Court.
Who advised Truman that I was insubordinate when I visited Chiang Kai-shek?
Who persuaded him to force me... to withdraw my letters to the Veterans of Foreign Wars?
Who are those who seek to humiliate me and undermine my authority?
The communists and their fellow travellers in the British Foreign Office.
If Inchon fails, they will have a jubilee.
The joint chiefs of staff approved this invasion because your arguments were valid.
Yes, they were valid.
But if the enemy is ready with a superior force... we will not be able to disengage... without suffering enormous losses.
We could lose this entire fleet.
This date could be marked as one of the greatest military tragedies in American history.
- General, I don't think for one--
- Are you surprised, Court?
I'm sharing my doubts with you after all these years.
[ Sardonic Chuckle ]
Did you think I was invulnerable?
- It just came in.
We've got Wolmi Do Island.
- What?
- Wolmi Do is ours.
- It took my boys 58 minutes.
Ho, ho! Ha, ha!
Good work, General Shepherd.
Good work.
I'll be the first to admit it.
- He did a hell of a job, and here's to him.
- Hear, hear.
What's the matter, Alvin?
Don't you like the taste of victory?
- Bourbon's not bad, either.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Yes, Inchon is a masterstroke.
- Damn right it is.
Now that's what
I call ''generaling.''
I've heard that the North Koreans have turned tail and are running for home.
It's not the North Koreans
I'm worried about.
Mr Panika, the Indian ambassador to Peking... informs us that any American troops above the 38th parallel... will provoke an intervention by the Chinese.
Yesterday we monitored this very same warning over Radio Peking.
We've heard that sort of thing before.
How serious are they?
Frankly, we don't know.
- What's MacArthur say about it?
- He's not worried.
- He's calling it political blackmail.
- He's probably right.
Mr President, let's watch our step. If we expand the war in Korea to include Red China... we're up against the Soviets,
A-bomb and all.
Alvin. You go on ahead to Wake Island.
Make the usual preparations.
I think it's time I had a talk with General MacArthur.
- I've never met the man.
- Yes, sir.
Wake Island, Mr President.
[ Truman ]
By golly, that was quick.
How about one of you fellas radioing on ahead?
See if the big general's there.
The president should be greeted.
He shouldn't be the greeter.
I don't see him, Mr President.
They probably had a little trouble getting him down off his cross.
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
- Wait a minute. There he is.
- That son of a bitch isn't in uniform, he's in costume.
I don't know why it is an old man like that, and a five-star general to boot... has to run around dressed up like a 1 9-year-old second lieutenant.
- [ Laughing ]
- I'll tell you one thing, if he was an officer in my outfit...
I'd bust him so fast he wouldn't know what happened.
And making me wait.
He can do that to Harry Truman, but not to his commander in chief.
General, I've been a long time meeting you.
- I hope it won't be so long next time.
- So do I.
- General Bradley.
- MacArthur.
Bess sent along a plum cake for the missus.
How very thoughtful.
Thank you, sir.
And how are Mrs Truman and your daughter?
They're fine.
Just fine, thank you.
General, I've read a little... military history, and it's a pleasure to congratulate you on your success at Inchon.
That was the work of a master strategist.
Thank you, Mr President. Coming from you, that's a real tribute.
And I'd like to apologize for any misunderstanding raised by my trip to Formosa.
Don't think anything more about that.
I understand your feelings.
I was a captain in
Battery D in World War I... and that was the centre of the war effort for me.
Perhaps you should have stayed in the army.
[ Laughs ]
Nope, I don't think so.
I've heard it's a bad idea for army men to dabble in politics.
Mr President, you know that I'm not involved in politics in any way.
I did let the politicians make a chump out of me in the '48 elections.
If a general is going to be running against you... his name will be Eisenhower, not MacArthur.
Eisenhower?
That man doesn't know as much about politics as a pig does about Sunday.
[ Chuckles ]
Uh, General...
I came over here to listen to your ideas... on the rehabilitation of postwar Korea.
Mind if I smoke, Mr President?
No, I suppose I've had more smoke blown in my face than any man alive.
The formal resistance,
I believe... should end in Korea by Thanksgiving.
And now that we've authorized military operations above the parallel...
- do you include North Korea in that estimate?
- Yes, I do.
By the time I'm finished, we should have the entire peninsula under control.
General, you do understand the limitations on your directive... from the joint chiefs of staff?
No military operations beyond the Chinese and Soviet borders... and no American troops near those borders.
Yes, I believe I understand that directive fully... and our boys should be home by Christmas, Mr President... provided that Red China stays out of the conflict.
Well, I'm glad to hear that, General.
I've got the whole
United Nations on my back.
A couple dozen members have got troops under you in Korea... and the bunch of them are scared stiff that we're pushing them into World War III.
There's no doubt that Stalin's pact with Mao Tse-tung... pledges that the Soviet A-bomb backs the Chinese if we should tangle with them.
You mentioned Chinese intervention.
Is there any chance of that?
Mr President, you must have... more complete intelligence on that matter than I have.
- Anything that I would say would be purely speculative.
- Of course.
I'm sure that you also realize that... any question involving China... requires a political evaluation, not simply a military one.
Our intelligence on the Chinese is limited.
They're believed to have about 300,000 men in Manchuria... but I doubt they could get more than
50,000 across the Yalu River.
They'd be highly vulnerable to our air attacks.
So in my opinion, the chances of Red intervention... are minimal.
And if they were to try to get down to the parallel... they'd be walking into disaster, a crushing defeat.
[ Crowd Cheering ]
Well, I've, uh-- I've never had a more satisfactory conference... since I've been president.
General MacArthur is a member of the government of the United States... and he's loyal to that government and to the United Nations... and he's loyal to the president and his foreign policy... and he's confident that the fighting in Korea will soon be over.
[ Applause ]
[ Man ]
Hey! What the hell is this?
Turkey! Real turkey!
What'd you expect, shithead?
It's Thanksgiving.
Best thing about Thanksgiving is eating white meat!
[ Laughter ]
- I tell you, if I had my way--
- [ Gunfire ]
[ Shouts, Groans ]
General Bradley called me at 6.1 5 this morning with a message from General MacArthur.
He says there are 260,000
Chinese out there against him.
He says he's stymied.
Says he has to go over on the defensive.
It isn't a matter of a few volunteers. The Chinese have jumped in with both feet.
Well, what are they saying about me in Washington?
Sir, to be candid about it, they think you walked into a Chinese trap.
That was a deliberate misunderstanding.
The defeat of the North Koreans was decisive.
In the face of this victory, the Chinese Communists... have committed the most offensive act of international lawlessness in history!
We are now facing a new, fresh... highly trained army!
What does Truman mean by calling this a ''police action''?
Isn't it a fact that the casualties are mounting daily?
This ''police action''... has almost destroyed the Korean nation.
For what?
I've seen as much blood and disaster as any man now living.
Every time
I come out of here...
I could just--just be sick!
It curdles my stomach.
Does he intend to let this go on?
By what sophistry of reason?
Sir, he has the Russians to consider... and our allies.
General Bradley feels the same way.
He says that a war with China would be the wrong war... at the wrong time in the wrong place and with the wrong enemy.
The joint chiefs of staff.
I requested permission to bomb the Chinese airfields in Manchuria.
The request was denied.
I requested permission for hot pursuit of enemy aircraft... into their privileged sanctuary above the Yalu.
That request was denied.
I requested permission to bomb the Yalu bridges to keep the Chinese out of Korea.
They said...
''You might bomb... the southern half of the bridges only.''
In my 50 years of military service...
I have never learned how to bomb half a bridge!
It's the most imbecilic order ever given to a commander in the field.
This... is appeasement.
Unless some positive and immediate action can be taken... we should withdraw our forces to Japan.
Forgive me, sir, but... there are some of those back home who believe... that it's possible to regain the offensive without-- well, without danger of widening the war.
Without widening the war?
Well, the 8th Army is Ridgway's now.
He can do what he likes.
It won't do any good.
For the first time in military history... a commander has been denied the use of his military power... to safeguard the lives of his soldiers and the safety of his army.
It leaves me with a sense of inexpressible... shock.
Well, hallelujah. Matt Ridgway's retaken Seoul. What'd I tell you?
[ MacArthur ]
I wish I could celebrate... but the war hasn't been won.
The battle lines roll up and down, up and down.
Victory nowhere in sight.
This isn't war.
It's half war.
It's an immoral compromise with evil.
There's more than dust settling in Korea, Sid.
It's American blood.
Yes, sir.
Oh, the head of the
United Kingdom mission wants an appointment with you, sir.
What does he want?
He's worried that we're getting desperate in Korea...
- and we'll use the bomb.
- Huh!
Probably more worried about protecting
British profits in Hong Kong...
- than in saving lives in Korea.
- I'll shift his appointment, sir.
Excuse me, General. We just got word that Washington wants you... to stop all offensive operations immediately.
What?
They want to effect a political rather than a military solution.
They're planning to draft a cease-fire proposal.
They ask for any recommendations you may have for minor adjustments... along your battle lines to consolidate your position for adequate defence.
''Minor adjustments''?
What are they talking about?
Why should I recommend anything?
This is total capitulation!
Well, sir, in view of
Truman's feeling, you want to substitute your policy for his.
[ MacArthur ] I couldn't substitute my policy for Mr Truman's... because Mr Truman doesn't have a policy!
Fine, sir. Why don't you let me notify them that you're taking the proposals under study--
No. I have a better idea.
We'll send a message to the Chinese commander.
Put it on all the wire services.
I want maximum exposure.
Sir, you have been specifically prohibited from issuing any statements.
Sir, that is a direct order from the president.
And that is part of a dangerous concept... that men of the armed forces owe their primary allegiance... to these temporary occupants of the White House... instead of to the country and the
Constitution we're sworn to defend!
[ Truman ]
I ought to kick his insubordinate ass right into the Sea of Japan.
The lousiest trick he's pulled.
I traveled 1 4,000 miles to reach an understanding face-to-face...
- and he still thinks he can do what he damn well pleases.
- [ Alvin ] Can you imagine?
He actually sent a message to the Chinese threatening to destroy their forces... unless they were to negotiate a solution with him personally.
You know, there's a story... where Abe Lincoln was trying to mount a horse that was skittish... and the horse kicked a hind hoof into the stirrup.
So Lincoln says to him,
''If you're gonna get on, I'll get off.''
Well, I'm not getting off.
I think Roosevelt should have pulled
Wainwright out of Corregidor... and left that five-star brass hat
MacArthur there to be the martyr.
What shall I do with the cease-fire proposal?
Scrap it. I can't approach the Chinese on any political basis, not after this.
That man's trying to start World
War III, and I'm trying to prevent it.
I'm gonna fire that brass hat prima donna right now.
Who does he think he is? God?
What do you think Congress would do if I relieved the big general?
Congress would flay you alive.
Fortunately for me, the navy outfielder's throw was also wild... over the third baseman's head, and with those two wild throws...
I was able to dash around the bases into home... with what turned out to be the winning run.
- Excuse me.
- And-- And the final score was...
West Point, 4, Annapolis, 3.
I think that the loudest cheers were led by my mother.
She was always there.
[ Laughs ]
They used to say about us that we were the first-- the only mother and son... ever to graduate from
West Point on the same day.
[ Laughter ]
That was in Annapolis in the spring of--
[ Inaudible Whispering ]
Well,Jeannie... we're going home at last.
That was the first varsity baseball game ever played... between West Point and the Naval Academy.
Well, so much for my baseball career... and for happy memories.
And now will you... excuse us, please?
[ Crowd Cheering ]
I've never seen anything like it.
The entire city's come out to celebrate the return of America's greatest hero.
Officials estimate from seven to ten million people... are here on hand, and that surpasses Lindbergh's... and Eisenhower's homecomings put together.
Schools are out.
The crowd is excited.
The office workers are-- just have taken a holiday.
[ Male Announcer #2 ]
Meanwhile, in our nation's capital... the statement from the joint chiefs of staff said in part, quote:
''It is fundamental that all military commanders...
''must be governed by our laws and the constitutional guarantee... of civilian control over the military.''
When asked to comment,
President Truman said:
People who think they're God are bound to get into trouble sooner or later.
You have to understand that the people of this country are men and women of common sense... and whenever anybody gets too far out of line, the people are gonna put him out of business.
[ Applause ]
[ MacArthur ]
But once war has been forced upon us... there is no other alternative... than to apply every available means... to bring it to a swift end.
War's very object is victory... not prolonged indecision.
In war... there can be no substitute for victory.
For history teaches us, with unmistakable emphasis... that appeasement but begets new and bloodier war.
Like blackmail, it lays the basis for new... and increasingly greater demands... until, as in blackmail... violence becomes the only alternative.
''Why--''
''Why,'' my soldiers asked of me...
''surrender military advantages to an enemy in the field?''
I could not answer.
The magnificence of the courage... and fortitude of the Korean people... defies description.
They have chosen to risk death... rather than slavery.
Their last words to me were...
''Don't scuttle the Pacific.''
I am closing my 52 years of military service.
When I joined the army, even before the turn of the century... it was the fulfilment of all my boyish hopes and dreams.
The world has turned over many times... since I took the oath on the plain at West Point... and the hopes and dreams have long since vanished.
But I still remember the refrain... of one of the most popular barrack ballads of that day... which proclaimed most proudly that...
''Old soldiers never die... they just... fade away.''
Like the old soldier of that ballad...
I now close my military career... and just... fade away.
An old soldier... who tried to do his duty... as God... gave him the light to see that duty.
Goodbye.
[ Whistles,
Shouts Of Approval ]
- Goodbye, hell.
He's running for president.
- [ Clicks Off ]
[ Male Convention Speaker ]
I give you the greatest war hero...
America has ever known, our finest leader of men... our most brilliant strategist... a man of inspiration and a man of action--
I give you the next president of the United States...
Five-Star General of the Army...
Dwight David Eisenhower!
[ Crowd Cheering ]
What kind of president do you think he's gonna make?
I think he'll make a fine president.
He was the best clerk who ever served under me.
[ MacArthur's Voice ]
The shadows are lengthening for me.
Twilight is here.
My days of old have vanished in tone and tint.
They have gone glimmering through the dreams of things that were.
Their memory is one... of wondrous beauty... watered by tears and coaxed and caressed... by the smiles of yesterday.
I listen vainly but with thirsty ear... for the witching melody... of faint bugles blowing reveille... of far drums beating the long roll.
In my dreams,
I hear the crash of guns... the rattle of musketry... the strange mournful mutter... of the battlefield.
But in the evening of my memory... always I return... to West Point.
Always there echoes and re-echoes... duty... honour... country.
Today... marks my final roll call with you.
But I want you to know that when I cross the river... my last conscious thoughts... will be of the corps... and the corps... and the corps.
I bid you... farewell.
Wer...
- ...are you?
- We are three wise men.
- What?
- We are three wise men.
What are you doing creeping around a cowshed at 2:00 a.m.?
That doesn't sound very wise to me.
- We are astrologers.
- We have come from the East.
- Is this some kind of joke?
- We wish to praise the infant.
- We must pay a homage to him.
- Homage? You're all drunk!
It's disgusting! Out! Come on, out!
Bursting in here with tales about
Oriental fortunetellers. Out!
- No, no, we must see him.
- Go and praise someone else's brat!
- We were led by a star!
- Led by a bottle more like! Go on, out!
- We must see him. We have presents!
- Out!
Gold, frankincense, myrrh!
Well, why didn't you say?
He's over there.
Sorry the place is a bit of a mess.
Well, what is myrrh anyway?
- It is a valuable balm.
- A balm?!
What are you giving him a balm for?
It might bite him!
- What?
- That's a dangerous animal!
- Throw it in the trough!
- No, it isn't!
- It's a great big...
- No, no, no, it is an ointment.
Well, there is an animal called a balm, or did I dream it?
So you're astrologers, are you?
Well, what is he then?
What star-sign is he?
- Capricorn.
- Capricorn, eh? What are they like?
Well, he's the Son of God.
Our Messiah.
King of the Jews!
- And that's Capricorn, is it?
- No, no, no, that's just him!
I was gonna say, otherwise there'd be a lot of them.
- By what name are you calling him?
- Brian.
We worship you, Brian, who are lord over us all.
Praise unto you, Brian, and to the Lord, our Father. Amen.
- Do you do a lot of this?
- What?
- This praising.
- No, no. No, no.
Well, if you're dropping by again, do pop in.
And thanks a lot for the gold and frankincense...
...but don't worry too much about the myrrh next time, all right?
Thank you. Goodbye.
Well, weren't they nice?
Out of their bloody minds, but still, look at that!
Here. Here, that's mine! Hey! Hey!
Shut up!
Brian
The babe they called Brian
He grew
Grew, grew and grew
Grew up to be
Grew up to be
A boy called Brian
A boy called Brian
He had arms and legs
And hands and feet
This boy
Whose name was Brian
And he grew
Grew, grew and grew
Grew up to be
Yes, he grew up to be
A teenager called Brian
A teenager called Brian
And his face became spotty
Yes, his face became spotty
And his voice dropped down low
And things started to grow
On young Brian and show
He was certainly no
No girl named Brian
Not a girl named Brian
And he started to shave
And have one off the wrist
And want to see girls
And go out and get pissed
A man called Brian
This man called Brian
The man they called Brian
This man called
Brian
How blessed are those who know that he's of God.
How blessed are the sorrowful.
They shall find consolation.
How blessed are those of gentle spirit.
They shall have the earth for their possession.
How blessed are those who hunger and thirst to see right prevail.
They shall be satisfied.
How blessed are those whose hearts are pure.
They shall see God.
- Speak up!
- Quiet, mum!
Well, I can't hear a thing.
Let's go to a stoning.
- You can go to a stoning anytime.
- Come on, Brian.
Will you be quiet?
Don't pick your nose!
I wasn't. I was scratching.
You was picking it while you was talking to that lady.
- I wasn't!
- Leave it alone. Give it a rest.
- Do you mind? I can't hear a word.
- Don't you "do you mind" me.
- I was talking to my husband.
- Talk to him somewhere else.
- I can't hear a bloody thing.
- Don't you swear at my wife.
I was only asking her to shut up so we can hear, big nose.
Don't you call my husband "big nose."
- Well, he has got a big nose.
- Could you be quiet, please?
- What was that?
- I was too busy talking to big nose.
I think it was,
"Blessed are the cheese makers."
What's so special about the cheese makers?
It's not meant to be taken literally.
It refers to any manufacturers of dairy products.
If you hadn't been going on, we'd have heard that, big nose.
Say that once more,
I'll smash your bloody face in!
Listen, might be a bit about "Blessed are the big noses."
Lay off him.
You're not so bad yourself, conk-face.
Where are you two from? Nose City?
One more time,
I'll take you to the fucking cleaners!
Language!
And don't pick your nose!
I wasn't going to.
I was gonna thump him!
Hear that? Blessed are the Greek.
- The Greek?
- Apparently, he's gonna inherit the earth.
- Did anyone catch his name?
- You won't thump anybody.
- I'll thump him if he calls me "big nose"!
- Shut up, big nose!
Right. I warned you.
I really will slug you so hard...!
It's the meek.
"Blessed are the meek."
That's nice, isn't it? I'm glad they getting something. They have a hell of a time.
Listen, I'm only telling the truth, you have got a very big nose.
Your nose is going to be three foot wide across your face by the time I'm finished!
Who hit yours? Goliath's big brother?
- Right, that's your last warning.
- Do pipe down.
Silly bitch, getting in the way.
Break it up!
- Come on, let's go to the stoning.
- All right.
Blessed is just about everyone with an interest in the status quo, right, Reg?
What Jesus blatantly fails to appreciate is it's the meek who are the problem.
Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg. Yes, I see.
Come on, Brian, or they'll have stoned him before we get there.
All right.
Hey, get off her. That's disgusting.
Officer, intervene here.
Attempted rape going on. It's the chap with the big nose's fault. He started it all.
I hate wearing these beards.
- Why aren't women allowed at stonings?
- It's written, that's why.
- Beard, madam?
- I haven't got time to go to no stonings.
He's not well again.
- Stone, sir?
- They've got them lying on the ground.
Not like these, sir. Look at this. Feel the quality of that. That's craftsmanship.
All right. We'll have two with points and a big, flat one.
Could I have a flat one, Mum?
Sorry. Dad.
All right. Two points, two flats and a packet of gravel.
Packet of gravel.
Should be a good one this afternoon.
- Local boy.
- Oh, good.
Enjoy yourselves.
Matthias, son of
Deuteronomy of Gath...
- Do I say yes?
- Yes!
...you have been found guilty by the elders of the town...
...of uttering the name of our Lord...
...and so as a blasphemer...
...you are to be stoned to death!
Look, I'd had a lovely supper, and all I said to my wife was:
"That piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah."
Blasphemy! He said it again!
- Did you hear him?
- Yeah! Yes, we did!
Really.
Are there any women here today?
Very well. By virtue of the authority...
...vested in me...
Lay off! We haven't started yet.
Come on! Who threw that?
Who threw that stone? Come on!
She did! She did!
He did! He did! He did!
Sorry, I thought we'd started.
- Go to the back.
- Oh, dear.
Always one, isn't there?
- Now, where were we?
- I don't think it ought to be blasphemy...
...just saying "Jehovah."
- He did! He did!
You're only making it worse for yourself!
Making it worse?!
How could it be worse?
Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah!
I'm warning you!
If you say Jehovah once more...
Right! Who threw that?
Come on! Who threw that?
Him! Him! Him!
- Was it you?
- Yes.
- Right...
- Well, you did say Jehovah.
Stop. Stop. Will you stop that?
Stop it!
Now, look. No one is to stone anyone until I blow this whistle.
Do you understand?
Even, and I want to make this absolutely clear...
...even if they do say Jehovah.
Good shot!
- Have I got a big nose, mum?
- Stop thinking about sex.
- I wasn't.
- You're always on about it.
Morning, noon and night.
"Will the girls like this, will the girls like that?
Is it too big, is it too small?"
- Alms for a leper.
- Alms for a leper.
Alms for an ex-leper.
Bloody donkey-owners, all the same, ain't they? Never have any change.
Here's a touch.
- Spare a talent for an old ex-leper?
- Buzz off.
Spare a talent for an old ex-leper?
A talent? That's more than he earns in a month.
- Half a talent then?
- No, go away.
- Big nose, let's haggle.
- What?
All right, let's say you open at one shekel, I start at 2000, we close at 1800.
- No.
- Go away!
- Leave him alone.
- All right. Two shekels, just two.
- Is this fun, eh?
- Look, he's not giving you any money.
Now piss off!
All right, final offer, half a shekel for an ex-leper?
- Did you say ex-leper?
- That's right, sir.
Sixteen years behind a bell and proud of it.
- Well, what happened?
- I was cured, sir.
- Cured?
- A bloody miracle, sir. God bless you.
- Who cured you?
- Jesus did, sir.
I was hopping along, minding my own business.
All of a sudden, up he comes, cures me.
One minute I'm a leper with a trade, next minute my livelihood's gone.
"You're cured, mate."
Bloody do-gooder.
Well, why don't you go and tell him that you want to be a leper again?
I could do that sir.
I could, I suppose.
I was gonna ask him if he'd make me a bit lame in one leg during the week.
You know, something beggable, but not leprosy, which is a pain in the ass.
Brian. Come and clean your room out.
- There you are.
- Thank you. Thank...
- Half a dinare for me bloody life story?
- There's no pleasing some people.
That's just what Jesus said, sir.
Good afternoon.
Hello, officer.
I'll be with you in a few moments, all right, dear?
What's he doing here?
- Don't start, Brian. Go clean your room.
- Bloody Romans.
Now, look, Brian. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have all this.
- And don't you forget it.
- We don't owe the Romans anything.
That's not entirely true, is it, Brian?
What do you mean?
Well, you know when you were asking me about your?
- My nose?
- Yes, well, there's a reason it's like it is.
What is it?
Well, I suppose I should have told you a long time ago, but...
Well, Brian...
...your father isn't Mr. Cohen.
- I never thought he was.
Now, none of your cheek!
He was a Roman, Brian.
He was a centurion in the Roman army.
- You mean you were raped?!
- Well, at first, yes.
- Who was it?
- Naughtius Maximus his name was.
Promised me the known world, he did.
I was to be taken to Rome, house by the Forum...
...slaves, asses' milk...
...as much gold as I could eat.
Then he, having his way with me he had:
Like a rat out of an aqueduct.
The bastard.
Yes, and next time you go on about the "bloody Romans"...
...don't forget you're one of them.
- I'm not a Roman, Mum.
And I never will be.
I'm a kike, a yid, a hebe, a hooknose.
I'm kosher, Mum. I'm a Red Sea pedestrian and proud of it!
Sex, sex, sex, that's all they think about, huh?
Well, how are you then, officer?
Ladies and gentlemen, the next contest is between...
...Frank Goliath, the Macedonian baby-crusher...
...and Boris Mineburg.
Thank you, madam.
Larks' tongues. Wrens' livers.
Chaffinch brains.
Jaguars' earlobes.
Wolf-nipple chips.
Get them while they're hot. They're lovely.
Dromedary pretzels, only half a dinar.
Tuscany fried bats...
I do feel, Reg, that any anti-imperialist group like ours...
...must reflect such a divergence of interest within its power base.
- Agreed. Francis?
- Judith's point of view is very valid...
...provided the movement never forgets it is the unalienable right of every man...
- Or woman.
...or woman...
...to rid himself...
- Or herself.
- Agreed.
- Thanks, brother.
- Or sister.
- Or sister...
Where was I?
- I think you finished.
- Right.
- It is the birthright of every man...
- Or woman.
Shut up about women, Stan.
You're putting us off.
Women have a perfect right to play a part in our movement.
Why are you always on about women, Stan?
I want to be one.
What?
I want to be a woman.
From now on, I want you all to call me Loretta.
- What?
- It's my right as a man.
Well, why do you want to be Loretta, Stan?
I want to have babies.
You want to have babies?!
It's every man's right to have babies if he wants them.
- But you can't have babies.
- Don't you oppress me.
I'm not oppressing you, Stan.
You haven't got a womb.
Where's the fetus gonna gestate?
You gonna keep it in a box?
Here, I've got an idea. Suppose you agree that he can't actually have babies...
...not having a womb, which is nobody's fault, not even the Romans'...
...but he has the right to have babies.
- Good idea, Judith.
We shall fight the oppressors for your right to have babies, brother. Sister.
- What's the point?
- What?
Why fight for his right to have babies when he can't have babies?
It is symbolic of our struggle against oppression.
Symbolic of his struggle against reality.
- Get out there. Get out.
- It's dangerous out there.
Larks' tongues. Otters' noses.
Ocelots' spleens.
- Got any nuts?
- Haven't got any nuts.
- I've got wrens' livers, badgers' spleens...
- No, no, no.
- Otters' noses?
- I don't want any Roman rubbish.
- Why don't you sell proper food?
- Proper food?
- Yeah, not those rich imperialist tidbits.
- Don't blame me. I didn't ask to sell this.
- All right, bag of otters' noses, then.
- Make it two.
- Two.
- Thanks, Reg.
- Are you the Judean People's Front?
- Fuck off.
- What?
- Judean People's Front.
We're The People's Front of Judea.
- Judean People's Front, God!
- Wankers.
- Can I join your group?
- No, piss off.
I didn't want to sell this. It's only a job.
I hate the Romans as much as anybody.
- Are you sure?
- Dead sure.
I hate the Romans already.
Listen, if you wanted to join the PFJ, you'd have to really hate the Romans.
I do.
- Oh, yeah, how much?
- A lot.
Right, you're in. Listen...
...the only people we hate more than
Romans are the Judean People's Front.
- Splitters.
- And the Judean Popular People's Front.
- Oh, yeah.
- Splitters.
- And the People's Front of Judea.
- Yeah. Splitters.
- What?
- The People's Front of Judea. Splitters.
We're the People's Front of Judea.
- I thought we were the Popular Front.
- People's Front.
Whatever happened to the Popular Front, Reg?
He's over there.
Splitter!
I think I'm about to have a cardiac arrest.
Absolutely dreadful.
- What's your name?
- Brian. Brian Cohen.
We may have a little job for you, Brian.
What's this then?
"Romanes eunt domus"?
"People called Romanes, they go the house"?
It says, "Romans go home."
No, it doesn't. What's Latin for Roman?
- Come on.
- Romanus?
- Goes like?
- Anus?
Vocative plural of anus is?
- Ani?
- Romani.
- "Eunt"? What is eunt?
- Go.
- Conjugate the verb "to go."
- Ere, eo, is, it, imus, itis, eunt.
So eunt is?
Third person plural, present indicative.
"They go."
But "Romans go home" is an order, so you must use the?
- Imperative!
- Which is?
- Oh, - i.
- How many Romans?
- Plural, plural. Ite. Ite.
- Ite.
Domus? Nominative?
"Go home." This is motion towards, isn't it, boy?
Dative! Not dative, not the dative, sir!
The accusative! Accusative!
Domum, sir. Ad domum.
- Except that domus takes the?
- The locative, sir.
- Which is?
- Domum!
Domum.
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.
- Write that 100 times.
- Yes, sir. Thank you. Hail Caesar.
If it's not done by sunrise,
I'll cut your balls off.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
Hail Caesar and everything, sir.
Finished.
Right. Now, don't do it again.
Hey. Bloody Romans.
We get in through the underground heating-system...
...up through into the main audience chamber here...
...and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.
Having grabbed his wife, we inform Pilate...
...that she is in our custody, and forthwith issue our demands.
- Any questions?
- What exactly are the demands?
We're giving Pilate two days to dismantle the entire Roman imperialist state...
...and if he doesn't agree immediately, we execute her.
- Cut her head off?
- Cut all her bits off.
Send them back on the hour, every hour.
Show them we're not to be trifled with.
And of course, we point out that they bear full responsibility when we chop her up...
...and that we shall not submit to blackmail.
No blackmail!
They've bled us white, the bastards.
They've taken everything we had.
And not just from us! From our fathers, and from our fathers' fathers.
- And from our fathers' fathers' fathers.
- Yeah.
- And our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers.
- All right, don't labour the point.
And what have they ever given us in return?
The aqueduct?
- What?
- The aqueduct.
Yeah, they did give us that.
That's true, yeah.
And the sanitation.
Yeah, the sanitation, Reg.
Remember what the city used to be like.
I'll grant you the aqueduct and sanitation, the two things the Romans have done.
- And the roads.
- Yeah, obviously the roads.
I mean the roads go without saying, don't they?
But apart from sanitation, aqueduct and roads...
- Irrigation.
- Medicine.
- Education.
- Yeah, yeah, all right, fair enough.
And the wine.
That's something we'd really miss, Reg, if the Romans left.
Public baths.
It's safe to walk in the streets at night now.
They know how to keep order.
Let's face it, they're the only ones who could in a place like this.
All right, but apart from sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order...
...irrigation, roads, the fresh-water system and public health...
...what have the Romans ever done for us?
- Brought peace?
- Peace. Shut up!
I'm a poor man. My sight is poor.
My legs are old and bented.
- It's all right, Matthias.
- It's all clear.
Well, where's Reg?
Reg. Reg. It's Judith.
- What went wrong?
- The first blow has been struck.
- Did he finish the slogan?
- 100 times.
In letters 10 foot high, all the way around the palace.
Oh, great.
Great. We need doers in our movement,
Brian, but before you join us, know this:
There is not one of us who would not gladly die...
...to rid this country of the Romans.
Well, one.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one. But otherwise, we're solid. Are you with us?
Yes.
From now on, you shall be called,
"Brian, that is called Brian."
Tell him about the raid on Pilate's palace, Francis.
Right. This is the plan:
Now, this is the palace
in Caesar's Square.
Our commando unit will approach
from Fish Street...
... and make our way
to the northwestern main drain.
If questioned, we are sewage workers
on our way to a conference.
Reg, our glorious leader
and founder of the PFJ...
... will be coordinating consultant
at the drain head...
... though he will not be taking part in any
terrorist action, as he has a bad back.
- Aren't you gonna come with us?
- Solidarity, brother.
Oh, yes. Solidarity, Reg.
Once in the sewer,
timing will be of the essence.
There is a Roman feast later,
so we must move fast...
... and don't wear your best sandals.
Turning left here, we enter
the Caesar Augustus Memorial Sewer.
And from there proceed directly
to the hypocaust.
This has just been re-tiled.
So terrorists, careful with those weapons.
We will now be directly beneath
Pilate's audience chamber itself.
This is the moment
for Habakkuk to get out his prong.
Campaign for Free Galilee.
People's Front of Judea. Officials.
- What's your group doing here?
- We're gonna kidnap Pilate's wife.
- So are we.
- What?
That's our plan.
- We were here first.
- What do you mean?
- We thought of it first.
- Oh, yeah?
Yes, a couple of years ago.
- We did.
- You got all your demands worked out?
- Of course we have.
- What are they?
- Well, I'm not telling you.
- Pull the other one.
That's not the point.
We thought of it before you.
- Did not.
- We did.
- You didn't.
- We bloody did!
Bastards, we've been planning this for months.
Well, tough titty for you, fish-face.
- All right.
- Why you sly...
Brothers! Brothers!
We should be struggling together!
We are.
We mustn't fight each other!
Surely, we should be united against the common enemy!
The Judean People's Front?!
No, no, the Romans!
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.
- Yeah, he's right.
- Look out!
Careful.
- Right! Where were we?
- You were gonna punch me.
Oh, yeah!
Brothers!
Get off!
- You lucky bastard.
- Who's that?
- You lucky, lucky bastard.
- What?
- Proper little jailer's pet, aren't we?
- What do you mean?
You must have slipped him a few shekels, eh?
Slipped him a few shekels?
You saw him spit in my face!
What wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face?
I sometimes hang awake at night, dreaming of being spat at in the face.
Well, it's not exactly friendly.
They had me in manacles!
Manacles!
My idea of heaven...
...is to be allowed to be put in manacles just for a few hours.
They must think the sun shines out of your arse, sonny.
Lay off me, I've had a hard time!
You've had a hard time?
I've been here five years...
...they only hung me the right way up yesterday! So don't you come around...
All right, all right.
They must think you're Lord God almighty.
- What will they do to me?
- You'll probably get away with crucifixion.
- Crucifixion?!
- Yeah. First offence.
- Get away with crucifixion?! It's...
- Best thing the Romans ever did for us.
- What?!
- Oh, yeah.
If we didn't have crucifixion, this country would be a mess.
- Guard!
- Nail them up, I say!
- Guard!
- Nail some sense into them!
- What do you want?
- I want you to move me to another cell.
Oh, look at that! Bloody favouritism!
- Shut up, you.
- Sorry.
Now, take my case.
They hung me up here five years ago.
Every night they take me down for 20 minutes...
...then they hang me up again.
Which I regard as very fair in view of what I've done.
And if nothing else, it's taught me to respect the Romans...
...and it's taught me that you'll never get anywhere in this life...
...unless you are prepared to do a fair day's work for a fair day's...
Shut up!
- Pilate wants to see you!
- Me?
- Come on!
- Pilate? What does he want to see me for?
I think he wants to know which way you ought to be crucified.
- Nice one, centurion. Like it, like it.
- Shut up!
Right. Right.
Terrific race, the Romans. Terrific.
- Hail Caesar.
- Hail.
Only one survivor, sir.
Throw him to the floor.
- What, sir?
- Throw him to the floor.
Now, what is your name, Jew?
- Brian, sir.
- Brian, eh?
No, no, Brian.
The little rascal has spirit.
- Has what, sir?
- Spirit.
Yes, he did, sir.
No, no, spirit.
Bravado, a touch of derring-do.
About 11, sir.
So...
- You dare to raid us?
- To what, sir?
Strike him, centurion, very roughly.
And throw him to the floor, sir?
- What?
- Throw him to the floor again, sir?
Oh, yes. Throw him to the floor, please.
Now, Jewish rapscallion...
I'm not Jewish, I'm a Roman.
- A Roman?
- No, no, Roman.
So your father was a Roman?
Who was he?
He was a centurion in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.
Really?
- What was his name?
- Naughtius Maximus.
Centurion, do you have anyone of that name in the garrison?
Well, no, sir.
Well, you sound very sure.
Have you checked?
Well, no, sir. I think it's a joke, sir.
Like "Sillius Soddus" or "Biggus Dickus," sir.
What's so funny about Biggus Dickus?
Well, it's a joke name, sir.
I have a very great friend in Rome called Biggus Dickus.
Silence! What is all this insolence?
You will find yourself in gladiator school very quickly...
...with rotten behaviour like that.
Can I go now, sir?
Wait till Biggus Dickus hears of this.
- Right! Take him away!
- Sir, he...
No, no, I want him fighting rabid wild animals within a week!
Yes, sir. Come on, you.
I will not have my friends ridiculed by the common soldiery!
Anybody else feel like a little...
...giggle...
...when I mention my friend...
...Biggus...
...Dickus?
And what about you?
Do you find it risible...
...when I say the name...
...Biggus...
...Dickus?
He has a wife, you know.
You know what she's called?
She's called...
...Incontinentia.
Incontinentia Buttocks. Shut up!
What is all this?
I've had enough of this rowdy-rebel, sniggering behaviour!
Silence!
You call yourselves centurion guards?
Seize him! Seize him!
Blow your noses and seize him!
You lucky bastard.
And the beast's head shall be huge and black...
...and the eyes. They're of red, with the blood of living creatures!
And the whore of Babylon shall ride forth on a three-headed serpent...
...and throughout the land shall be a great rubbing of parts.
And the demon shall bear a nine-bladed sword!
Nine-bladed! Not two or five or seven, but nine!
Which he will wield on all wretched sinners. Sinners just like you, sir, there.
- And the horns shall be on the head...
- Through Hebediah, his servant...
...there shall in that time be rumours of things going astray...
...and there shall be a great confusion as to where things really are.
And nobody will really know where lieth those little things...
...with the sort of raffia-work base, that has an attachment.
At this time, a friend shall lose his friend's hammer...
...and the young shall not know where lieth...
...the things possessed by their fathers...
...that their fathers put there only just the night before, about 8:00.
Yea, it is written in the Book of Cyril...
...that in that time shall the turds...
- How much? Quickly.
- What?
- It's for the wife.
- Twenty shekels.
- Right.
- What?
- There you are.
- Wait a minute.
- What?
- Well, we're supposed to haggle.
- No, I've got to...
- What do you mean, "No"?
- I haven't got time...
- Give it back.
- No, no, no, I just paid you.
- Burt.
- Yeah?
- This bloke won't haggle.
- Won't haggle?!
- All right, do we have to?
- Now look, I want 20 for that.
- I just gave you 20.
- Are you telling me that's not worth 20?
- No.
Look. Feel the quality, that's none of your goat.
- All right, I'll give you 19.
- No, come on, do it properly.
- What?
- Haggle properly, this isn't worth 19.
- Well, you just said it was worth 20.
- Oh, dear, oh, dear.
- Come on, haggle.
- All right, I'll give you 10.
That's more like it.
Ten? Are you trying to insult me?
Me, with a poor, dying grandmother? Ten?
- All right, I'll give you 11.
- Now you're getting it. 11?!
Did I hear you right? 11?
- This cost me 12, you want to ruin me?
- Seventeen?
- No, no, no, no, "17"!
- Eighteen?
- No, no, you go to 14 now.
- All right, I'll give you 14.
- Fourteen!? Are you joking?
- That's what you told me to say!
- Oh, dear.
- Tell me what to say, please!
- Offer me 14.
- I'll give you 14.
- He's offering me 14 for this!
- Fifteen!
Seventeen. My last word, I won't take a penny less, or strike me dead.
- Sixteen.
- Done.
Nice to do business with you.
- I'll throw you in this as well.
- I don't want it.
- Burt.
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Now, where's the 16 you owe me?
I just gave you 20.
- That's right, that's four I owe you.
- No, that's all right.
- No, I've got it here.
- It's all right, that's four for the gourd.
Four? For this gourd? Four!?
It's worth 10 if it's worth a shekel!
- You just gave it to me for nothing.
- Yes, but it's worth 10.
All right, all right.
No, no, no, no, it's not worth 10, you're supposed to argue.
"Ten for that? You must be mad!"
Oh, well. One born every minute.
- Daniel.
- Daniel.
- Job.
- Job.
- Job.
- Joshua.
- Joshua.
- Joshua.
- Judges.
- Judges.
- Judges.
- And Brian.
- And Brian.
- And Brian.
I now propose that all seven of these ex-brothers...
...be now entered in the minutes as probationary martyrs to the cause.
- I second that, Reg.
- Thank you, Loretta. On the nod.
Siblings, let us not be down on it.
One total catastrophe like this is just the beginning!
Their glorious deaths shall unite us all in a...
Look out!
Hello?
Matthias?
- Reg.
- Go away.
- Reg, it's me, Brian.
- Get off. Get off out of it.
- Stan?
- Piss off.
- Yeah, piss off.
- Bugger off.
Shit!
Coming.
Yea, verily at that time, which is written in the Book of Obadiah...
...a man shall strike his donkey and his nephew's donkey...
...and anyone in the vicinity of either the nephew or the donkey.
My eyes are dim, I cannot see.
- Are you Matthias?
- Yes.
We believe you may be hiding one Brian of Nazareth...
...member of the terrorist organization the People's Front of Judea.
Me? No, I'm just a poor old man,
I have no time for lawbreakers.
My legs are grey, my ears are nulled, my eyes are old and bent...
Quiet!
Silly person. Guards, search the house.
You know the penalty laid down by Roman law for harbouring a known criminal?
- No.
- Crucifixion.
- Nasty, eh?
- It could be worse.
- What do you mean, "could be worse"?
- Well, you could be stabbed.
Stabbed? It takes a second.
Crucifixion lasts hours.
It's a slow, horrible death.
Well, at least it gets you out in the open air.
You're weird.
No, sir, couldn't find anything, sir.
Well, don't worry, you've not seen the last of us, weirdo.
- Big nose.
- Watch it!
That was lucky.
- I'm sorry, Reg.
- Oh, it's all right. Siblings, he's sorry.
He's sorry he led the Fifth legion to our headquarters.
Well, that's all right then, Brian.
Sit down! Have a scone.
Make yourself at home.
You klutz!
You stupid, birdbrained, flat-headed...
- with a great juicy melon behind.
My legs are old and bent, my ears are grizzled, yes?
There's one place we didn't look. Guards!
I'm just a poor old man, my sight is dim, my eyes are poor, my nose is knackered.
- Have you ever seen anyone crucified?
- Crucifixion's a doddle.
Don't keep saying that.
Found this spoon, sir.
Well done, sergeant.
We'll be back, oddball.
- Open up.
- You haven't given us time to hide.
Don't pass judgment on other people, or you might get judged yourself.
What?
I said, don't pass judgment on other people...
...or else you might get judged too.
- Who, me?
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.
- Well, not just you, all of you.
- That's a nice gourd.
- What?
- How much do you want for the gourd?
- You can have it.
- Have it?
- Yes. Consider the lilies.
- Don't you want to haggle?
- No. In the field.
- What's wrong with it, then?
- Nothing, take it.
- Consider the lilies?
- Well, the birds, then.
- What birds?
- Any birds.
- Why?
- Well, have they got jobs?
- Who?
- The birds.
Have the birds got jobs?!
- What's the matter with him?
- He says the birds are scrounging.
No, the point is the birds, they do all right, don't they?
- Well, and good luck to them!
- Yeah, they're very pretty.
Okay. And you're much more important than they are, right?
So, what are you worrying about?
There you are! See?
I'm worrying about what you've got against birds.
I haven't got anything against birds.
Consider lilies...
- He's having a go at the flowers now.
- Give the flowers a chance.
- I'll give you one for it.
- It's yours!
Two then.
Look, there was this man, and he had two servants...
- What were they called?
- What?
- What were their names?
- I don't know.
And he gave them some talents...
- You don't know?
- Well, it doesn't matter.
He doesn't know what they were called!
Oh, they were called
Simon and Adrian. Now...
You said you didn't know!
It doesn't matter, the point is there were two servants...
- He's making it up as he goes along!
- No, I'm not!
And he gave them...
Wait a minute, were there three?
- He's terrible.
- There were three...
- He's still a traitor!
- Oh, get off!
Now hear this. Blessed are they...
...who convert their neighbour's ox, for they shall inhibit their girth.
- Rubbish!
- And to them only shall be given...
To them only...
...shall be given...
What?
- Shall be given what?
- Oh, nothing.
- What were you going to say?
- Nothing.
- You were going to say something.
- I finished.
- Oh, no, no.
- Come on, tell us before you go.
- I wasn't going to say anything.
- No, you hadn't.
- What won't he tell us?
- He won't say.
- Is it a secret?
- No.
- Is it?
- It must be, otherwise he'd tell us.
- Tell us.
- Leave me alone.
- What is the secret?
- Is it the secret of eternal life?
He won't say!
If I knew the secret of eternal life, I wouldn't say.
- Leave me alone.
- Just tell me, please.
- No, tell us, master, we were here first.
- Rubbish!
- Five!
- Go away!
- Tell us, master.
- I can't go above 5.
- Is that his gourd?
- Yes, but it's under offer.
- This is his gourd.
- Ten!
It is his gourd.
We will carry it for you, master.
Master?
He's gone. He's been taken up.
- Oh, he has been taken up!
- Eighteen!
No, there he is. Over there.
Look!
- He has given us a sign.
- He has given us his shoe.
The shoe is the sign!
Let us follow his example!
- What?
- Let us, like him...
...hold up one shoe and let the other be upon our foot...
...for this is his sign that all who follow him shall do likewise!
No, no, the shoe is a sign that we must gather shoes together in abundance.
- Cast off the shoes. Follow the gourd!
- No, let us gather shoes together.
- Let me!
- Oh, get off!
No, it is a sign that, like him, we must think...
...not of the things of the body, but of the face and head!
- Give me your shoe!
- Get off!
Follow the gourd, the holy gourd of Jerusalem!
- The gourd!
- Hold up the sandal, like he has...
- It is a shoe! It is a shoe!
- It's a sandal!
- No, it isn't! It is a shoe!
- Cast it away!
- Put it on!
- Now clear off.
Take the shoes and follow him!
Come all ye who call yourselves Gourdenes.
Stop, I say.
Stop. Let us...
Let us pray.
Yea, he cometh to us like the seed to the grave...
Master!
Hey, is there another way down?
Is there another path down to the river?
Please, please, help me! I've got to get...
My foot!
- Damn! Damn! Damn!
- I'm sorry.
- Damn! Damn and blast it!
- I'm sorry!
Don't you shush me. Eighteen years of total silence, and you shush me.
- What?
- I've kept my vow for 18 years.
Not a single recognizable, articulate sound has passed my lips.
Please be quiet for another five minutes.
It doesn't matter now,
I might as well enjoy myself.
The times in the last 18 years
I wanted to shout and sing...
...and scream my name out!
Oh, I'm alive!
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Hello, birds! Hello, trees! I'm alive...
Get off! I'm alive!
Master! Master!
The master! He is here!
- The shoe!
- It was the gourd!
The shoe has brought us!
Speak! Speak to us, master!
Speak to us!
- Go away!
- A blessing! A blessing!
- How shall we go away, master?
- Just go away and leave me alone.
Give us a sign.
He has given us a sign, he has brought us to this place!
I didn't bring you here!
You just followed me!
It's still a good sign, by any standard.
Master, your people have walked many miles to be with you.
They are weary and have not eaten.
- It's not my fault they haven't eaten!
- There is no food in this high mountain.
What about the juniper bushes over there?
A miracle! A miracle!
He has made the bush fruitful by his word!
They brought forth juniper berries!
Of course they brought forth juniper berries, they're juniper bushes.
What do you expect?!
Show us another miracle.
Do not tempt him, shallow ones!
Is not the miracle of the juniper bushes enough?
- I say, those are my juniper bushes.
- They are a gift from God!
They're all I've bloody got to eat.
I say, get off of those bushes!
Go on! Clear off, the lot of you.
- Lord, I am affected by a bald patch.
- I'm healed!
- The master has healed me!
- I didn't touch him!
I was blind, and now I can see!
A miracle! A miracle! A miracle!
Tell them to stop it. I hadn't said a word for 18 years till he came along.
A miracle! He is the Messiah!
- And he hurt my foot!
- Hurt my foot, Lord! Hurt mine! Hurt mine!
- Hail Messiah!
- I'm not the Messiah!
I say you are, Lord.
And I should know, I've followed a few!
- Hail Messiah!
- I'm not the Messiah!
Would you please listen, I am not the Messiah, do you understand?
Honestly!
Only the true Messiah denies his divinity.
What? Well, what sort of chance does that give me?
- All right, I am the Messiah!
- He is! He is the Messiah!
Now, fuck off!
- How shall we fuck off, Lord?
- Just go away! Leave me alone!
You told these people to eat my juniper berries.
You break my bloody foot, you break my vow of silence...
...and then you try and clean up on my juniper bushes!
Lay off! This is the Messiah, the chosen one!
- No, he's not.
- An unbeliever!
An unbeliever!
- Persecute! Kill the heretic!
- Yeah! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill!
- Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone.
Put him down. Please!
Brian?
Judith?
Look, there he is!
The chosen one has woken!
Brian!
Mother!
- Brian!
- Hang on, Mother!
- Hello, Mother.
- Don't you "hello, Mother" me.
- What are those people doing out there?
- Well, I...
Come on! What have you been up to, my lad?
I think they must have popped by for something.
Popped by?! Swelled by, more like.
There's a multitude out there!
They started following me yesterday.
Well, they can stop following you right now.
Now stop following my son.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
The Messiah! The Messiah!
Show us the Messiah!
- The who?
- The Messiah!
There's no Messiah in here.
There's a mess all right, but no Messiah.
Now go away!
Brian! Brian!
Right, my lad, what have you been up to?
- Nothing, Mum.
- Come on, out with it.
They think I'm the Messiah, Mum.
- What have you been telling them?
- Nothing, l...
- You're only making it worse for yourself.
- Look, I can explain...
No, let me explain, Mrs. Cohen!
Your son is a born leader!
Those people out there are following him because they believe in him.
They believe he can give them hope.
Hope of a new life, a new world, a better future!
- Who's that!?
- That's Judith, Mum.
Judith, Mother.
Show us the Messiah!
Now you listen here, he's not the Messiah!
He's a very naughty boy! Now go away!
- Who are you?
- I'm his mother, that's who.
Behold his mother! Behold his mother!
Hail to thee, mother of Brian!
Blessed art thou! Hosanna!
All things to thee, now and always!
Now, don't think you can get around me like that.
He's not coming out, and that's my final word.
Now shove off!
No!
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes!
- Oh, I see. It's like that, is it?
- Yes!
All right then, you can see him for one minute, but not one second more!
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
- Promise?
- Well, all right.
All right, here he is then.
Come on, Brian, come and talk to them.
- But, Mum, Judith...
- Leave that Welsh tart alone.
I don't really want to, Mum.
- Good morning!
- A blessing! A blessing!
No, please. Please, please, listen!
I've got one or two things to say.
Tell us! Tell us both of them!
Look, you've got it all wrong!
You don't need to follow me.
You don't need to follow anybody!
You've got to think for yourselves.
You're all individuals!
Yes, we're all individuals!
You're all different.
Yes, we are all different!
I'm not.
You've all got to work it out for yourselves!
Yes, we've got to work it out for ourselves!
Exactly!
- Tell us more!
- No, that's the point!
Don't let anyone tell you what to do!
- Otherwise... Oh, no!
- That's enough! That's enough.
That wasn't a minute.
- Oh, yes, it was.
- Oh, no, it wasn't!
Now stop that, and go away.
- Excuse me?
- Yes?
Are you a virgin?
I beg your pardon?
Well, if it's not a personal question, are you a virgin?
If it's not a personal question?!
How much more personal can you get?
Now piss off.
- She is.
- Must be. Definitely.
Definitely. Definitely.
Morning, Saviour!
Lay your hands on me! Quick!
Now, don't jostle the chosen one!
Please!
Don't push that baby in the
Saviour's face! He'll touch it later!
I say...
Could he see my wife?
She has a headache.
You'll have to wait, I'm afraid!
She's very bad, and we've got a luncheon!
Look, the lepers are queuing!
Her brother-in-law is the ex-mayor of Gath.
Can I introduce you to the man who's letting us have the mounts on Sunday?
- Hello.
- Don't push!
Now keep the noise down, please!
Those possessed by devils, try and keep them under control a bit! Can't you?
Incurables, you'll just have to wait for a few minutes.
Women taken in sin, line up against that wall, will you?
Brian?
Brian! You were fantastic!
- You weren't so bad yourself.
- No, what you said just now!
- Quite extraordinary!
- What? Oh, that. Was it?
We don't need leaders! You're so right!
Reg has been dominating us for too long.
- Well, yes...
- It needed saying, and you said it, Brian!
You're very attractive.
It's our revolution!
We can all do it together!
I think...
We're all behind you, Brian!
The revolution is in your hands!
What?
No, that's not what I meant at all!
You're fucking nicked, me old beauty!
Right!
Stop it!
Well, Brian, you've given us a good run for our money.
A what?
And this time,
I guarantee you will not escape.
Guard!
Do we have any crucifixions today?
139, sir. Special celebration.
Passover, sir.
Right! Now we have 140!
Nice round number, eh, Biggus?
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail!
The crowd are getting restless, sir.
Permission to disperse them, please.
Disperse them?
But I haven't addressed them yet!
No, I know, sir, but...
My address is a high point of Passover!
My friend Biggus Dickus has come all the way from Rome to hear it!
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail Caesar!
You're not...
You're not thinking of giving it a miss this year, then, sir?
Give it a miss?!
Well, it's just that they're in a rather funny mood today, sir.
Really, centurion!
I'm surprised to hear a man like you rattled by a rabble of rowdy rebels.
- A bit thundery, sir.
- Take him away!
I'm a Roman! I can prove it, honestly!
And crucify him well!
Biggus!
- I really wouldn't, sir!
- Out of the way, centurion!
Let me come with you, Pontius. I may be of assistance if there is a sudden crisis!
Right! Now, item four: Attainment of world supremacy within the next five years.
- Francis, you've done some work on this?
- Yeah, thank you, Reg.
Well, quite frankly, siblings,
I think five years is optimistic...
...unless we can smash the Roman
Empire within the next 12 months!
- Twelve months?
- Yeah, 12 months.
And let's face it, as empires go, this is the big one.
So we gotta get up off our arses and stop just talking about it!
Hear! Hear!
I agree! It's action that counts, not words, and we need action now!
You're right. We could sit around here all day, talking, passing resolutions...
...making clever speeches, it's not gonna shift one Roman soldier!
So let's just stop gabbing on about it!
It's completely pointless...
...and it's getting us nowhere!
- Right!
I agree!
This is a complete waste of time!
They've arrested Brian!
- What?
- They've dragged him off!
They're gonna crucify him!
Right!
This calls for immediate discussion!
- What?!
- Immediate!
- Right!
- New motion?
Completely new motion!
That there be immediate action...
Once the vote has been taken.
Obviously once the vote's been taken.
Can't act on a resolution...
- Reg, let's go now, please!
- Right! Right!
In the light of fresh information from sibling Judith...
- Not so fast, Reg.
- Reg, for God's sake!
It's perfectly simple!
All you've gotta do is to go out of that door now...
...and try to stop the Romans nailing him up!
It's happening, Reg!
Something's actually happening, Reg!
Can't you understand?
- Yeah, hello.
- Another little ego trip from the feminists.
- What?
- Sorry, Loretta.
Read that back, would you?
Next.
- Crucifixion?
- Yes.
Good. Out of the door, line on the left, one cross each.
Next.
Crucifixion?
Good. Out of the door, line on the left, one cross each. Next.
- Crucifixion?
- No, freedom.
- What?
- Freedom for me.
They said I hadn't done anything so I could go free and live on an island.
That's jolly good.
Well, off you go, then.
No, I'm only pulling your leg.
It's crucifixion, really.
I see. Very good, very good.
Well, out of the door.
Out of the door, one cross each, line on the left.
Line on the left. Yes, thank you.
Crucifixion?
- Yes.
- Good.
People of Jerusalem!
Rome is your friend!
To prove our friendship, it is customary at this time...
...to release a wrongdoer from our prisons.
Whom would you have me release?
Release Roger!
Release Roger! Release Roger!
Very well, I shall release Roger!
Sir, we don't have a Roger, sir.
- What?
- We don't have anyone of that name, sir.
We have no Roger!
But what about Roderick, then?
Release Roderick! Release Roderick!
Centurion, why do they titter so?
Just some Jewish joke, sir.
Are they ragging me?
Oh, no, sir!
Very well. I shall release Roderick!
Sir, we don't have a Roderick either.
- No Roger, no Roderick?
- Sorry, sir.
Who is this...?
Who is this Roderick to whom you refer?
He is a robber!
And a rapist!
And a pickpocket!
He sounds a notorious criminal.
We haven't got him, sir.
Do we have anyone in our prisons?
- We've got a Samson, sir.
- Samson?
Samson the Sadducee Strangler, sir.
Silas the Syrian Assassin.
Several seditious scribes from Caesarea.
Sixty-seven...
- Let me speak to them, Pontius!
- Oh, no!
Good idea, Biggus!
Citizens! We have Samson the Sadducee
Strangler, Silas the Assyrian Assassin...
...several seditious scribes from Caesarea...
Next.
- Crucifixion?
- Yes.
Good. Out of the door, line on the left, one cross each. Jailor?
- Excuse me? There's been a mistake...
- Just a moment, would you? Jailor?
- How many have come through?
- What?
How many have come through?
What?
You'll have to speak...
Speak up, sir.
He's... He's d...
He's deaf... Deaf as a post, sir.
How many have come through?
- Oh, dear.
- I make it 90...
Ninety...
Ninety...
Ninety-six, sir.
It's such a senseless waste of human life, isn't it?
No, sir!
Not with these b...
Bastards, sir!
Crucifixion's too good for them, sir.
I don't think you could say it's good, it's nasty!
It's not as n...
Not as nasty as something
I just thought up, sir.
- Now, crucifixion?
- Is there someone I could speak to?
- Well...
- I know where to get it if you want it.
- What?
- Don't worry about him, sir. He's de...
He's deaf and mad, sir.
Well, how did he get the job?
Bloody Pilate's pet, sir!
Get a move on, big nose! There's people waiting to be crucified out here!
Could I see a lawyer or someone?
- Do you have a lawyer?
- No, but I'm a Roman.
How about a retrial?
We've got plenty of time.
- Shut up, you!
- Miserable, bloody Romans!
No sense of humour.
Sorry, bit of a hurry.
Can you go straight out, line on the left, one cross each? Now...
Was it something I said?
Silence!
This man commands a crack legion!
He ranks as high as any in Rome!
Crucifixion party?
Morning.
Now, we will be on show as we go through the town, so let's not let the side down!
Keep in a line, three lengths between you and the man in front...
...and a good, steady pace.
Crosses over your left shoulders, and if you keep your backs hard up...
...against the crossbeam you'll be there in no time.
All right, centurion!
Crucifixion party!
Wait for it.
Crucifixion party!
By the left! Forward!
You lucky bastards!
You lucky, jabby bastards!
Let me shoulder your burden, brother!
Thank you.
- Hey! Hey!
- What do you think you're doing?
It's not my cross...
Shut up and get on with it!
Come on!
He had you there, mate, didn't he?
That'll teach you a lesson!
All right!
I will give you one more chance!
This time I want to hear no Rubens, no Reginalds...
...no Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeers.
No Spencer Tracys!
Or we shall release no one!
Release Brian!
Yeah, that's a good one!
Release Brian! Release Brian!
Very well! That's it!
- Sir, we have got a Brian, sir.
- What?
- You just sent him for crucifixion, sir!
- Wait! Wait! We do have a Brian.
- Well, go and free him, straight away!
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Very well. I shall release Brian!
- Get a move on, there!
- Or what?
Or you'll be in trouble!
Oh, dear. You mean I might have to give up being crucified in the afternoons?
- Shut up!
- That would be a blow, wouldn't it?
I wouldn't have nothing to do!
Thank you!
Are they gone?
We've got lumps of it around the back.
What?
Don't worry about him sir, he's ma...
- He's mad, sir.
- Have they gone?
- Oh, come on.
- Yes, sir.
- Anyway, get on with the story.
- Well, I just never really liked them, so l...
Right! The motion to get on with it passed with one abstention.
I propose we go without further ado.
May I have a second?
- Let's just go.
- Yeah.
- Bloody Romans!
- Watch it! Still a few crosses left!
Up you go, big nose!
I'll get you for this, you bastard!
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah, don't worry. I never forget a face.
- No?
- I warn you.
I'm gonna punch you so hard, you Roman git!
Shut up, you Jewish turd!
Who are you calling Jewish?
I'm not Jewish, I'm a Samaritan!
A Samaritan? This is supposed to be a Jewish section!
It doesn't matter!
You're all gonna die in a day or two!
It may not matter to you, but it matters to us. Doesn't it, darling?
Oh, rather!
Under the terms of the Roman occupancy...
...we're entitled to be crucified in a purely Jewish area.
Pharisees separate from Sadducees!
And Swedish separate from Welsh!
All right, all right, all right!
We'll soon settle this!
Hands up, all those who don't want to be crucified here!
Right! Next!
- Look, it's not my cross.
- What?
It's not my cross,
I was holding it for someone.
- Just lie down, I haven't got all day!
- Of course. Look, I hate to make a fuss...
Look, we've had a busy day, and there's 140 of you lot to get up.
- Is he Jewish?
- Will you be quiet?!
We don't want more
Samaritans around here.
Belt up!
- Will you let me down if he comes back?
- Yeah, yeah, we'll let you down.
- Next!
- You don't have to do this!
- You don't have to take orders!
- I like orders.
See? Not so bad once you're up.
- You're being rescued then, are you?
- It's a bit late for that now, isn't it?
No, we've got a couple of days up here.
Plenty of time.
Lots of people get rescued.
Oh, yeah.
My brother usually rescues me.
If he can keep off the tail for more than 20 minutes.
Randy little bugger.
Up and down like the Assyrian Empire.
Hello. Your family arrived then?
Reg!
- Hello, sibling Brian.
- Thank God you've come, Reg.
I think I should point out in fairness that we are not the rescue committee.
However, I have been asked to read this prepared statement...
...on behalf of the movement.
"We, the People's Front of Judea, brackets, officials, end brackets...
...do hereby convey our sincere fraternal and sisterly greetings to you, Brian...
...on this occasion of your martyrdom."
- What?
"Your death will stand as a landmark in the continuing struggle to liberate...
...the parent land from the hands of the Roman imperialist aggressors...
...excluding those concerned with drainage, medicine, roads, housing...
...education. And any other Romans contributing to the welfare of Jews...
...of both sexes and hermaphrodites."
Signed, "On behalf of the P.F.J., et cetera."
And I'd just like to add, on a personal note, my own admiration...
...for what you're doing for us and what must be, after all, for you, a difficult time.
- Reg! What are you going to do?
- Goodbye, Brian. And thanks.
All right, Brian. Keep it up, lad.
Terrific work, Brian.
Right. And:
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
And so say all of us
And so say all of...
You bastards! You bastards!
- Where is Brian of Nazareth?
- You sanctimonious bastards!
- I have an order for his release.
- You stupid bastards!
- I'm Brian of Nazareth.
- What?
- I'm Brian of Nazareth.
- Take him down!
I'm Brian of Nazareth!
- I'm Brian!
- I'm Brian!
Look, look, I'm Brian!
- I'm Brian!
- I'm Brian and so is my wife!
- Right! Take him away and release him!
- No, I'm only joking. I'm not really Brian.
No, I'm not Brian! I was only...
It was a joke.
I'm only pulling your leg!
It's a joke!
I'm not him,
I'm just having you on!
Put me back!
Bloody Romans, can't take a joke.
The Judean People's Front!
The Judean People's Front!
Forward, all!
- Look out! The Judean People's Front!
- The Judean People's Front!
The Judean People's Front!
We are the Judean People's Front, crack suicide squad.
Suicide squad, attack!
That showed them, huh?
You silly sods!
Brian!
Judith!
Terrific! Great! Reg explained it to me, and I think it's great what you're doing.
Thank you, Brian. I'll never forget you.
So there you are!
I might have known it would end up like this.
Just think of all the love and affection I've wasted on you!
Well, if that's how you treat your poor, old mother...
...in the autumn years of her life, all I can say is:
Go ahead. Be crucified.
See if I care.
- I might have known.
- Mum! Mum!
I don't know what the world is coming to.
Cheer up, Brian!
You know what they say?
Some things in life are bad.
They can really make you mad.
Other things just make you swear and curse.
When you're chewing on life's gristle
Don't grumble
Give a whistle
And this'll help things
Turn out for the best
And
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the light side of life
If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile
And dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle
That's the thing
And always look on
The bright side of life
Come on!
Always look on the right side of life
For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face
The curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it
It's your last chance anyhow
So always look on
The bright side of death
Just before
You draw your terminal breath
Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke
It's true
You'll see it's all a show
Keep 'em laughing as you go
Just remember that
The last laugh is on you
And always look on
The bright side of life
Always look on the right side of life
Come on, Brian! Cheer up!
Always look on the bright side of life
Always look on the bright side of life
Worse things happen at sea, you know?
Always look on the bright side of life
What have you got to lose?
You come from nothing...
...you're going back to nothing, what have you lost?
Nothing!
Nothing will come from nothing, you know what they say?
Cheer up, you old bugger!
Come on! Give us a grin!
There you are!
See? The end of the film. Incidentally, this record is available in the foyer.
Some of us have got to live as well, you know?
Who do you think pays for all this rubbish?
They're not gonna make their money back, you know.
I told them. I said to him.
"Bernie," I said,
"They'll never make their money back."

His Majesty's triumphed again!
Idols pale beside the radiance of His Majesty!
I didn't know she was interested in religion!
I wonder who His Majesty will favor today?
What divine benevolence!
I haven't seen her at court before.
What some people will do.
Really. Provincial Bitch!
Encore!
Encore!
A most original conception,
Your Majesty: The birth of Venus.
I pray that I may assist you in the birth of a new France, where Church and State are one.
Amen!
- Come on, you Protestant bastards!
- Go on, keep moving!
Put your back into it!
Move!
Move!
- Get on. Come on there! Move!
I won't tell you again.
Pull, you Protestant pigs! Pull!
Push it!
The religious wars... are over.
Catholic no longer fights with Protestant.
We have survived, and we owe our survival to the wisdom and to the humanity of one man:
Georges de Sainte-Marthe,
Governor of Loudun.
For it was he that prevailed upon all faiths alike to keep the peace, and thus saved our city from self-destruction.
Other towns were less fortunate.
And now our friend has been killed by the Plague.
People of Loudun, as often as you see our city walls standing still proud and erect, no matter what your faith, then surely you must feel a need to build a temple in your hearts, in remembrance of he who preserved them for you.
Amen.
- Amen!
- Hurry up, it's my turn now!
- I haven't seen anything yet.
- Another moment and he'll be gone.
- Is he as handsome as they say?
Yes, I can see the procession.
It's coming up the steps!
I can't see...
Yes, I can see him! He's the most beautiful man in the world!
Sister Agnes! Sister Agnes!
Why have you left your devotions?
They were watching Father Grandier!
We wanted to see the funeral procession of Monsieur Sainte-Marthe,
Reverend Mother.
Satan is ever ready to seduce us with sensual delights.
Your prayers for Sainte-Marthe will be the more zealous for not seeing his funeral.
That is the strength of the enclosed order.
Yes I know, Reverend Mother.
But it was a solemn requiem, and the Cardinal would have given us a dispensation to attend.
The powers of your uncle the Cardinal are not in dispute, Sister Agnes.
If you are not satisfied with the contemplative life, you should have joined the Poor Clares.
Nursed the victims of the Plague, scrubbed out their vermin-ridden hovels...
But Mother, I love our Order.
Then you shall combine the two:
Scrub out the convent from top to bottom, on your knees, and pray for the soul of the dead man at the same time.
Every Tuesday afternoon an hour in bed with the lacemaker's widow, then off to take confession.
I mean, the hypocrisy of it!
It's no worse than his penitents.
The pretty ones, anyway.
They do it right there, in the sacristy, almost in front of the blessed sacraments!
Grandier could have me anywhere, even on the holy altar itself!
Ssh! That's sacrilege!
Look, there he is!
Now there's a man well worth going to Hell for, eh?
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me!
I'm beautiful!
I'm beautiful!
Take away my hump!
Take away my hump!
Christ, let me find a way to You!
Take me in Your sacred arms, and let the blood flow between us, uniting us!
Grandier! Grandier!
Ave Maria...
Translate as you go, line by line.
"Pleasure in lust is nasty and short and sickness..."
Weariness.
"And weariness follows on desire."
Go on.
Oh, I don't like it! I hate it.
Your father sends you here for instruction in Latin.
And we must not deceive him.
But in everlasting leisure like this,
I can still kiss time away, no weariness and no shame.
Now, then and shall be all pleasure.
No end to it, but an eternal beginning.
Why are you crying?
I'm pregnant.
And so it ends...
You must learn to bear your cross with Christian fortitude, my child.
I'm frightened!
Yes, of course.
How can I own the child?
I'm very frightened!
And there was such bravery in love, wasn't there, Philippe?
All for those summer nights, how unafraid we were each time we huddled down together. Remember?
We laughed as we roused the animal, and now...it's devoured us.
- Help me.
And we were to have been each other's salvation.
Did I really believe it possible?
- I love you.
- Yes, I do believe it.
I remembered leaving you one day.
You'd been unusually adroit.
I was full of that indecent confidence which comes after perfect coupling.
And as I went I thought:
Honestly, I thought, the body can transcend its purpose.
It can become a thing of such purity.
That it could be worshipped to the limits of imagination.
Everything is allowed.
All is right.
And such perfection lends for an understanding of this... heedless state of existence.
But what is it now?
An egg!
A thing of loneliness, weariness, sickness.
Where is love?
Where indeed?
Go to your father.
Tell him the truth.
Let him find some good man... if they exist.
Help me!
How can I help you?
Hold my hand.
Like touching the dead, isn't it?
Goodbye, Philippe!
Don't be too long!
Up your end!
He's leaking.
Madam, here comes...there!
They're all dead!
They're all dying! All of them!
Father! Father!
Please come quickly!
The chemist and the surgeon are no good. Mother's dying!
A delicate dusting of pollen.
Nature's most fragrant balm:
The eucalyptus pollen!
From the Greek "kaluptos":
Covered flower protected by a cap.
Entrapped from the heroic ordent.
Hymenopterate healer!
A poison to exorcise poison.
A kill or cure!
Yesterday, powdered mistletoe!
Black cherry water!
- It's a recognized cure.
Nobody ever complains.
Leeches!
Dried vipers!
Sarsaparilla and poppy heads!
And now what?
Hornets?
And what fresh lunacy is this?
A crocodile?
- Walking two by two!
Simian reptile, corpuscular circulation.
Invaluable aid!
He's got the crocodile!
Turn your face towards God, my daughter.
Be glad! Be glad!
You stand on the threshhold of everlasting life. I envy you.
Bring out your dead!
Bring out your dead!
Bring out your dead!
Bring out your dead!
Let us pray for her together.
We commend to Thee oh Lord, the soul of Thy servant, Madam...
De Brou.
De Brou!
De Brou.
And although to this world she is dead, to Thee may she still live.
And the sins she has committed in this life through... through human frailty, do Thou, in Thy merciful goodness, forgive.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Where are you? Hiding among the corpses, are you?
Come out you coward, the dead shall not save you now!
Where is he?
- Who?
The priest, that desecrater of virtue, Grandier!
No woman in the entire town is safe from the lust of that man, not one!
- Neither mother nor daughter!
- Living or dead!
- Necrophilia interruptus!
- Virgo distracta!
Whores! He stinks of sanctimonious whores!
Enough's enough!
You slander my daughter.
- He's inside the house, Mr. Magistrate!
- He's there inside the house.
There he is.
Despoiler of my child!
My innocent lamb!
Even the most innocent lamb is destined for the lustful ram,
Monsieur Trincant.
Her lily-white purity is stained!
Except in sermons or in Heaven... even lilies decay into rotteness, sir!
Catch!
I'll see you in Hell!
Walking on a living pavement of aborted bastards, no doubt!
You foul, God-forsaken creature!
He ought to be reported to the Pope!
He ought to be prosecuted as well, Monsieur Magistrate.
My cousin tells me his daughter is pregnant.
Well, you have your whores.
Why do you have to meddle with her?
- It seemed a way.
- A way to what?
I begin to understand at last that all worldy things have a single purpose for a man of my kind.
Power, pol韙ics, riches, women, pride, ambition...
I choose them with the same care that your cousin Monsieur Trincant might select a weapon.
My intention is different.
You see,
I need to turn them against myself.
- And bring about your own end?
I have a great need...
To be united with God.
You're a blasphemy to your cloth!
I attend Mass daily.
I love God.
And now that both my parents are dead, I'm free to serve Him.
I know I have a vocation,
Reverend Mother.
You have the face of a virgin martyr in a picture book.
Very pious.
Respectful black weeds, very becoming.
That's such a pretty rosary!
- It was my mother's. - What's this?
Oh yes, The Imitation of Christ!
Solid silver!
And down-cast eyes.
Hiding what?
Virtue or lechery?
So you have one sin at least:
The sin of pride.
Do you know why most of us are here?
Because you love
Our Lord Jesus Christ, and wish to serve Him.
Most of the nuns here are noblewomen who have embraced the monastic life because there was not enough money at home to provide them with dowries.
Or they were unmarriageable because ugly or a burden to the family.
Communities which ought to be furnaces where souls are forever on fire with the love of God are merely dead with the great ashes of convenience. Here's a book.
Written by the founder of our Order, Angela Mereci.
When you've studied it come back.
I shall question you.
Thank you, Mother.
God bless you.
I'm not surprised that
Angela Mereci's book of sanctimonious clap-trap confused you.
Most religions believe that by crying "Lord, Lord" often enough they can contrive to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
A flock of trained parrots could just as readily cry the same thing with just as little chance of success.
You can do more good outside the cloister than you can within.
Amongst the Ursulines or the Carmelites you'll be hiding your light under a bushel.
Your place is here, in Loudun.
And your vocation, to give shining example of wisdom to all those foolish virgins whose thoughts dwell on perishable vanities.
And now I must take confession.
Yes, Father. Thank you.
Father I have sinned, and I've come to ask your forgiveness!
When did you last confess, my child?
You should know!
This is a church, not a marketplace!
You will speak with respect.
- You did love me, I mean, I know!
I mean, all those hours we spent together in each other's arms!
That's enough!
You will not wallow complacently in your own filth!
What about yours, what about your sins?
To confess is to seek forgiveness, not to blame others...
Be quiet, there!
And what shall I do?
Your humiliation is nothing.
If God wants you to suffer, then you should want to suffer, and accept that suffering gladly.
Go now. Do not sin again.
And for your penance, pass for the rest of the day on your knees in front of God praying for His forgiveness.
I absolve thee from thy sins.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
- When did you last confess, child?
- A week ago, Father.
What have you to tell me?
I have suffered from pride.
We must always be on guard.
I worked all of yesterday and all of the night nursing the victims of the Plague and I was pleased with myself.
God allows us satisfaction in the work that we do.
I've also been guilty of anger.
Tell me.
Sister Jeanne of the Angels provoked me and I wished her...elsewhere.
You are absolved.
Is there anything else?
Quickly, others are waiting!
- I've had unclean thoughts.
- Of what nature?
- About a man.
- What is his name?
I think of him nearly all hours of the morning.
My bedroom is suffocatingly hot.
My thoughts are sinful, and yet they are so tender.
My body, Father...My body!
I wish to be touched.
Do you try to get these thoughts out of your mind?
Or do you like them?
- I've prayed!
Do you wish to be saved from this? Answer!
No! I wish to take...possess...
Destroy me, I love you...
Him!
I love him.
In the convent
I would have been safe.
I love you!
Go to my house.
Wait for me there.
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.
But you were here only yesterday.
Yes, Father. But since then
I've been guilty of...guilty of...
What was it now?
If you have forgotten, perhaps God has also.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for me, a sinner, now and always, Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed are you among all women, blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for me, a sinner...
I want to tell you...
Yes?
- You know about lovemaking?
- Yes.
I want to tell you, Madeleine...
That amongst the clothes dropped on the floor, and the groping, and the sweating, and the soiled sheets, amongst all that there is some love.
Human love.
You understand it that way?
I think so.
Do I love you?
I think so.
Then what else can I give you?
I am a simple person.
I see the world as I've been taught.
I am a sinner, but I do not think that God has deserted me.
I would not be afraid to come before
Him with you. Even in our sin.
You shame me!
Go!
I've hurt you.
I've hurt you. Forgive me!
Go!
Oh God, help me!
I love this woman.
Let us find a way to You together.
The fifth sorrowful mystery of the Rosary: Christ crucified.
As we say these Aves, Sisters, let us think of the pain that Christ suffered when they nailed Him to the cross, and left Him to hang there until He was dead...
Think of His most beautiful body, torn by the nails...
The blood oozing over His hands, which twitched with every hammer blow.
And He suffered all this for Love.
For Love!
Forgive us our sins!
Forgive us our sins!
Loving me...
Marriage?
Marriage is a law of Nature and therefore a law of God.
I don't question whether marriage is a natural and holy thing, but whether it is a right and proper thing that a priest might marry.
If you care to read every law in the New Testament, you won't find anywhere that it's forbidden to marry.
In fact marriage is exalted so high it becomes a sacrament, doesn't it?
Virginity is also praised as a noble virtue.
Saint Paul says that he who marries does a good thing, but he who remains chaste does something better.
Then I am content merely to do a good thing, and leave the best to those that can face Him.
Christ never forbade the apostles to marry.
Most of them were married, with families.
They gave them all up, nevertheless, to follow Him.
Out of convenience, not obligation.
I mean, can you imagine all those wives and children traipsing across those endless deserts and up the mountainsides?
Oh no. They remained well and truly married until the end.
So there is no law of God compelling Grandier to be celibate?
I... take the words of our
Creator as my gospel.
It is not good for
Man to be alone.
You almost put my conscience at rest.
Who is responsible?
Who is in charge here?
Speak, you have tongues!
Who is responsible for this?
I ask again:
Who is responsible here?
Baron de Laubardemont, First
President of the Court of Appeals, member of the Council for the State, and now His Majesty's
Special Commissioner for the demolition of the fortifications of Loudun.
At your service, Father.
For what purpose has
His Majesty authorized the destruction of our town,
Baron De Laubardement?
I thought you would have been the first to guess the purpose, Father, and the first to condone it.
Loudun is a nest of dangerous Hugenots, they outnumber we good
Catholics two to one!
Every single Protestant in Loudun remained loyal to the King and to France throughout the religious wars!
Today's loyalty is no guarantee against tomorrow's rebellion, Father!
I speak as I find. Where is
His Majesty's proclamation?
Don't concern yourself with pol韙ics,
Father. Your penitents are waiting!
Grandier!
Grandier will stop them...
I ask you once again:
Where is His Majesty's proclamation authorizing this demolition?
For a common priest you act uncommonly like a Governor, Father!
Where is your authority?
- Here!
By the authority of our late
Governor, Sainte-Marthe, assuring me full powers until such time as a new election is held.
Here. - His Majesty's proclamation has been delayed.
It's a matter of a few days, a mere formality.
Should one more stone be torn from our city walls, you will be dead before it touches the ground.
Stop!
Work will cease from this moment, pending the arrival of the proclamation!
Well done, Father!
God bless you, Father!
Only you could have done that Father, thank you!
Good, Father, good!
We'll always think of you, Father, for what you've done.
- Well done, Grandier!
- God bless you.
It is a simple matter to understand,
Your Majesty.
The self-government of the small provincial towns of France must cease.
The first step is to pull down all kinds of fortifications. - Yes!
So now it's the turn of our town!
Is everything to be torn down?
That is what they want.
It is a trick, of course!
Every time there's a so-called
"nationalist revival", it means one thing:
Somebody is trying to seize control of the entire country.
The significance of our walls is that we are self-governing.
- Yes, yes!
- Richelieu hates this!
He deceives the King.
If France is to fulfill her own destiny, she must be free within herself.
- Yes?
Ignorance and crafty provincials like us, cannot see beyond the city walls.
And so they're ordered to be torn down.
Will it broaden our view?
Such men, Sire, have little vision.
Their loyalties are to their cities, not to France. - Yes!
When a man is intent on power as Richelieu is, he can justify his actions with absurdities.
Fortifications provide opportunities for Protestant uprisings!
Yes!
With our walls gone, we shall be defenseless, at the mercy of any enemy.
As weak and as helpless as a country village.
And with the security of our independence gone, our freedoms would go too.
We must write to the King, declare our loyalty, and trust in his wisdom and justice.
No!
All the others if you like,
Richelieu. If you can manage it.
But not Loudun.
We once promised dear old Sainte
Marthe, the late lamented governor, that we would never touch one teeny weeny stone of his precious city.
You would surely not expect us to go back on our word?
No, Your Majesty.
Yes!
Yes!
Go, pretty little birdy!
Fly away, fly away!
Another Protestant bird for your bag, Richelieu?
Honorably done, Your Majesty.
Bye-bye, blackbird!
Father Mousaut was a very good man.
It was God's will.
But his death leaves us with a problem:
We need a new father confessor.
I've never met you
Father Grandier, but God has often put you into my thoughts lately.
Bless this ring, oh Lord, which we bless in Thy name.
May she who is to wear it be forever faithful to her husband.
May she enjoy the peace of mind docile to Thy will.
Loving, and being loved in Thee, as long as life shall last.
And so Father Grandier, I trust you will become our spiritual director, provide us with the guidance we need.
Yours in Christ...
With this ring, I thee wed.
This gold and silver, I thee give.
With my body, I thee worship.
And with all my worldly gifts
I thee endow.
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
Amen.
Grandier!
Grandier!
We should step out into the sunlight:
A bell should tell the world about us.
It shouldn't be night and as quiet as this.
Dear God, my husband!
Kiss me!
Son of a lawyer, nephew of the learned Canon Grandier of Sain.
Educated for 10 years in the
Jesuit College of Bordeaux as undergraduate, theological student, and after his ordination in 1615, as Jesuit novice.
At 27 after 2 years of advanced theology and philosophy presented by the Jesuits with the import of living at St. Peter's in Loudun, made Chaplain of the...
- cha!
With a progressive
Jesuit upbringing it's not surprising your priest is bold and willful.
If he were allowed to become
Governor of Loudun, he would defend Catholic and Protestant alike.
And have command of the most heavily fortified town in all of Poitou, Your Eminence!
As long as Loudun stands, we will never gain control of the southwest.
Its fortifications must be demolished!
The masonry we could use to build your new town of Richelieu.
Except the rebel priest will not allow one stone to be touched.
And neither will the King.
- That is a whim!
But in the fullness of time, he will see that it is God's will.
And what of the militant
Father Grandier, Your Eminence?
He is far from whimsical.
If only for the sake of his immortal soul, the priest must be humbled and his pride crushed.
But with that Jesuit background, it will not be easy. You know what they say.
Give us the first seven years of a man's life, and you can have the rest.
You'll never break him.
I too have a maxim, Eminence:
Give me three lines of a man's handwriting and I will hang him.
Doors!
I want to marry Grandr!
- But he's already married to me!
Silence!
And do you, Madeleine de Brou, take me, Urbain Grandier...
for your unlawfully wedded husband?
I do, most unreverend Father!
Then I now pronounce us
Man and Wife!
And they shall be one flesh!
Sister Agnes, please stop this dreadful mockery!
But it's true. The butcher told me and he heard it from the surgeon.
It happened last week.
I feel that I no longer have a true vocation, Reverend Mother.
And my confessor has advised me that I can be of more use out here in the city.
Whore! Strumpet! Hypocrite!
Tell me you've got no vocation?
Of course you have a vocation!
Fornicator!
Fornicator!
Sacr韑egious bitch!
Seducer of priests, that's your calling!
Your place is in a brothel!
You filthy whore!
Get back to the gutter where you belong!
If only he'd seen me first!
My face unto its wimple like an angel's face peeping through a cloud, and my height...
- Excuse me, Reverend Mother, but our new spiritual director is here in the chapel.
He wishes to see you.
Grandier!
Grandier! Grandier!
It's not too late, you'll see.
Where is Father Grandier?
- My name is Father Mignon.
My letter was to Father Grandier.
Father Grandier regrets he cannot accept the invitation to become director of your house.
I'm to be your new confessor.
Father Grandier hasn't the time.
He has very pressing duties in the town.
Pressing duties in the town...
Right.
I must address myself to God in this matter.
Habit, habit? It will never do.
It must be demurred...
He speaks to me of love.
Lewd, wanton...
He plies me with caresses.
Lustful, obscene.
He enters my bed at night and takes from me that which is consecrated to my divine bridegroom,
Jesus Christ!
And what form does this incubus take?
Cock!
Grandier!
- What?
Grandier!
Are you aware my dear, of the seriousness of what you are saying?
Yes. Help me, Father.
But of course I can prove nothing.
This Mother Superior may be little more than a hysterical nun.
Exactly! Mere conjecture.
Now my daughter's pregnancy, is that not evidence enough?
Evidence of fornication, certainly.
Yes but whether lay or clerical, it might be rather difficult to prove.
As you should well know,
Mr. Magistrate.
He has a point there.
His Excellency has a point!
- I told you...
- Take her out!
Surely our evidence is damning enough on its own.
A blasphemous nuptial Mass...
Observed from the back of the church in total darkness.
And fornication! I've heard it.
Through the keyhole!
I have it documented: 10:00, 4:00 and half past 8 yesterday.
Your patriotism does you proud, gentlemen. But it is not enough.
Father Mignon's evidence holds the most promise.
It must be substantiated, of course.
But if it is a genuine case of possession by devils, and if Grandier himself was proved to be involved...
Then yes, I think it bears investigation, gentlemen.
I should be only too happy to supply you with any medical advice, Baron.
And I will comment on any chemical or biological manifestations.
May I attend as a disinterested party?
Father?
Certainly. If this is a genuine case, then the more the merri...
She's already complaining of spasmodic swelling of the belly.
- Fascinating. - Not unusual.
Sense of false pregnancy.
Known it before.
- Nothing to do with the Devil.
Wind.
Conjecture is useless. We need a professional witch hunter.
We must send for Father Barre.
Good morning, Sister.
My name is Father Barre.
Are you well?
I'm very well, thank you Father.
Excellent.
Are you there?
Are you there?
Come now, declare yourself, in the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ.
You're a sister in Christ,
I must question you.
Will you kneel down?
Do you remember the first time your thoughts were turned to evil things?
Yes, Father.
I had a vision.
I saw a man walking across the waters of a lake.
I dried his person with my hair.
I had a great knowledge of love, which persisted throughout my prayers.
I could not rid my mind of this man for several days.
Who was this man?
There was a mist,
I couldn't see him.
This is nothing! This public exorcism was a mistake.
Let's stop it now before we become the laughing stock of the entire town!
We are unconvinced, my dear Sister.
And if our conviction remains untouched,
I do not have to remind you that you face eternal damnation.
- Poor Reverend Mother!
- What are they going to do now?
Speak! Speak!
It was night.
He came into my room smiling.
- Name him.
- I cannot. It was dark.
- Was he alone? - No, six of his creatures were with him.
Then? Then?
He took me gently in his arms, he carried me into the chapel, each of his creatures took one of my beloved Sisters with him...
Come here!
What?
She says she and her Sisters were compelled to form themselves into an obscene altar, and were worshipped.
And then they took us apart and laid on us and loved us all.
And then my love and I in a naked embrace, ascended into Heaven and bathed in a sea of stars!
I have found peace.
The woman's mad!
- Morning!
- Morning!
- Where shall I put it?
- Down your end.
- A bit chilly this morning.
- Still, we mustn't complain!
That was no devil.
She spoke with her own voice, the voice of a frustrated woman!
That's enough!
- Do not be so easily deceived.
Her very innocence is a sham, a mask of deceit devised by the cunning of Satan.
Be assured:
The Fiend is silently lurking in some hidden recess of her body.
As medical examination will reveal.
And then we shall do battle.
This is a fiasco!
We shall need more evidence.
Find out when Grandier's away.
His room must be searched.
And your daughter may have to give testimony after all!
Yes, Excellency, yes.
- Well?
- As a professional man...
He speaks for me.
- I don't like to commit myself.
- Even so?
Let's put it this way:
There's been hanky-panky.
Don't mince words.
There's been fornication?
- Lust? She's been had.
- I'll say.
Thank you gentlemen. That's all
I need. Prepare for the exorcism.
My beloved Sister.
- Yes.
It must be extreme measures...
- What do you mean, Father?
- The Fiend must be forced from you!
Consecrate the water please,
Father Mignon!
Through that instrument, my child, lies your salvation. - Christ, no!
- Do you hear me, Ezvonane?
- Mercy, mercy!
Unhand me, you Christ-loving runt!
There you are with it.
The Antichrist has spoken!
Forgive me! I didn't mean it,
I didn't mean it!
Don't ask for mercy now after your blasphemy invoked against Our Lord!
But Father please, was I speaking to you now?
Sister Jeanne of the Angels?
Ezvonane!
You speak with many voices!
Christ protect me from the hands of Satan!
Have mercy, have mercy!
Oh dear Jesus, have mercy!
- Silence, Beast!
- Are you all ready there?
- We are ready!
Then drive out the Fiend!
- Steady...
- Father, for the love of...
- I exorcize thee, most foul Spirit...
- Oh Jesus, Jesus!
The entire spectre... the whole legion, in the name of Jesus Christ, to leave the body of this creature of God!
These priests are depraved!
It is they who are guilty of sacrilege.
Sister Jeanne is innocent!
She has been deliberately provoked by the priests.
They have desecrated God's house...
- Oh, shut up!
- A blasphemous spectacle!
- You're blind, all of you!
She is not possessed by the Devil.
It's just pain and hysteria.
- This is an offense against the Holy...
Who are these dissenters?
The smaller one is
Alain Legrand, the baker.
The other one's Rangier, owns the largest hotel...
I think we might soon acquire an interest in the catering trade, my friend!
Excellent! It looks as if business will be brisk.
The tourist season will start early this year. We'll need a larger theater!
The Devil it seems, departed from the Mother Superior...
At 10:45, precisely.
Who was responsible for this evil possession,
Sister Jeanne of the Angels?
- A priest...
- A priest? Of what church?
- Saint Peter's...
- Saint Peter's.
Tell his name.
- Grandier.
- Grandier!
Don't go tomorrow.
I must go.
If the city is to be saved,
I must go.
Stay here and crush these slanders.
Then see the King.
And lose the chance of a royal audience for the sake of a crazy nun?
While I'm away the whole rid韈ulous affair will be forgotten.
Now go to sleep, will you?
Have you offended this woman in any way?
I have never seen her.
Then why has she picked on you?
Oh, I don't know.
Secluded women, they give themselves to God, but something remains which cries out to be given to Man.
I mean, can you imagine being awakened in the night by a dream?
A dream of your childhood...
Or your lover.
Or even the vision of a good meal.
Now this is sin.
And so you must take up your little whip and start scourging your body.
This is discipline.
But pain is sensuality.
And in its vortex spin images of horror and lust.
My beloved sister in Jesus seems to have set her mind on me.
There's no reason. A piece of gossip perhaps overheard and magnified.
Anything found in the desert of a frustrated life can bring hope.
And with hope comes love.
And with love comes hate.
So I possess this woman.
May God help her in her misery and unhappiness.
And may God bless and cherish you while I'm away.
You're accused of being in league with the Devil, and in obstructing Father
Barre's cure of Sister Jeanne!
You rebel against the will of the Church, the will of Christ and the will of His Most Holy representative,
Cardenal Richelieu!
And in resisting officers of the Crown, in the pursuance of their duty, you are also guilty of treason!
You are unrepentant heretics!
There is no act more vile!
You are traitors!
You'll be executed! Now!
Stop!
God has revealed to me that these good Sisters are rattled with the fever that torments the body of Sister Jeanne.
The evil in her flesh has infected the young and innocent bodies of her charges.
Sin can be caught as easily as the Plague!
If Father Barre is right, my good Sisters, you may save yourselves yet.
You would not be the first to see the light.
You are tainted!
The Devil is in your flesh!
The evil spirit of Grandier has taken possession of your souls.
Now you resist him, but soon he will have his way.
You will scream?
- Yes!
- You will blaspheme?
- Yes!
You will no longer be responsible for your actions?
Denounce your devilish master
Grandier, and we will save you!
A quick word before
I leave for home.
The King's very sympathetic.
After reading our petition, he dictated a letter
ordering De Laubardemont to leave our walls intact.
I could hardly believe that so important a thing could be settled so easily.
The more I think about it, the more it seems that the King's heart
was moved by something more than usual good sense and understanding.
Each morning I wake up with a feeling of
optimism so strong as to be almost absurd.
The truth of the matter is that
Richelieu rules the King.
At the moment the King is smiling on us.
But that may not last too long.
We will need help and courage.
Strange thoughts come to me.
I am like a man who has been lost, who has always been lost.
Now for all kinds of reasons
I have a vague sense of meaning,
and can think of myself as a small part of God's abundance.
Which includes everything.
And I know I want to serve it.
I want to serve the people of Loudun.
I want to serve you.
Pray for us all.
Especially me.
Oh Evil One, in the name of the Lamb that conquered the Lion and Dragon, will you depart from this woman?
- Tell me, tell me!
- That's a left ventricle.
It's part of the heart of a child.
A sacrifice for the witches' sabbath, no doubt!
Look, a consecrated wafer!
That's blood, thick blood, blood of a man.
Grandier? Grandier?
That slimy substance could only be semen.
- And what's that?
- That's a carrot.
Make way for His Excellency, the Duke de Conde!
Make way!
I don't wish, my dear Father, to disturb your devotions, and I would never suggest that a member of the royal family, albeit one so close to the King, should take precedence over God.
All the same...
- Love me, love me!
I am at your service, Sire.
These raving women are possessed of devils, I take it?
Acting on the instigation of a priest, Sire!
So I understand.
Most amusing! Pray proceed.
- Kiss me, kiss me!
Those are women, my darling.
Look well.
Vomit, if you wish.
No! Don't touch them.
Man is born of them.
Gross things, nasty, breeding ground!
Eggs hatched out in hot dung.
No, don't wrinkle your little nose, my pet. Here, take this scent.
Some men love them!
This poor deluded priest Grandier, for example. He deserves all he gets.
With your permission Sire,
I'll begin.
Please do so.
But first I have a declaration to make.
This, Sire, contains the Holy Eucharist.
Heavenly Father,
I pray that I may be confounded and that the maledictions of Dathan and Aphirom may fall upon me, if I have sinned or been at fault in any way in this affair.
A very commendable gesture.
Bravo!
Leviathan.
Leviathan!
Announce yourself in the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ!
Listen filth, I'm going to speak a name to you: Grandier!
Grandier!
Father!
May I try this?
A holy relic from the King's own chapel.
A phial of the blood of
Our Lord Jesus Christ.
Tell me Father...
What effect would the close proximity of this relic have on devils such as these?
It would put them to flight!
- At once?
- Immediately!
Of course I couldn't guarantee that when the relic was removed they wouldn't return.
Of course not, that would be asking too much.
But would you care to try?
In the name of the Heavenly Father,
I conjure thee, most frightful beings, by this most sacred substance... to depart!
I've been freed!
I'm free.
- You are most welcome, my child.
You see?
You see, Father?
What sort of a trick have you played on us?
Oh Reverend Sir, what sort of a trick are you playing on us?
Have fun?
Goodbye, ladies! I am very pleased to have been of some service.
Come along, my darlings!
Praise the Lord,
He is with thee!
Te Deum!
I know I am a weak, bad man.
But after this journey, I may find the strength to change.
To summon towards myself the goodwill
and wisdom that lies in the people of Loudun.
The King has secured our stones.
Now we have to show him that the city
is the strength that lives in the hearts of men.
That greed and dissension will never destroy her.
And with God's help, we will change her walls to terraces
that have the color of stars.
Save yourself, my daughter!
Save us all!
Spurn your evil seducer forever.
Declaim his guilt to the world.
Give us peace.
Give us peace.
Yield not to me, but to the minister of Christ, for His power and His being, will subjugate thee to His cross!
You have turned the house of the Lord into a circus!
And its servants into clowns!
You have seduced the people, in order to destroy them!
You have perverted the innocent.
And was not that innocent child,
Madeleine de Brou, perverted by your blasphemous nuptial Mass?
It wasn't blasphemy! We were married without guilt in the eyes of God.
He is witness to our love.
I have prostituted myself... to Grandier!
I have prostituted myself.
He promised to make me a princess in the Devil's court, he took me to a witches' sabbath, he defiled my body, he was naked, he bears the marks of the Evil One.
The first mark is on the shoulder, the second on the tongue, the third on the rump, the fourth, the fifth on his right testicle and his left testicle.
If no blood flows when these areas are cut or pricked, this is the true sign of the Devil!
No!
Call me vain and proud, the greatest sinner to ever walk on God's earth, but Satan's boy I could never be!
I haven't the humility.
I know what I have sown and
I am prepared for what I shall reap.
But do you, Reverend Mother, know what you must give to have your wish about me fulfilled?
I will tell you:
Your immortal soul to eternal damnation.
May God have mercy on you.
- Seize him.
- On what charge?
- Heresy!
Stop them!
Father Grandier is innocent.
The decision has been made to implicate an innocent man.
- Arrest those men!
- He's one of them! He's one of them!
He kissed the Devil's rump.
He's a fornicator of women!
This is a plot.
We must stop them!
It's all a scheme to break a promise, and when he's gone, to take our city!
Our freedom!
- He's one of them!
They've taken Christ's law...
Don't stand there!
Help him!
Forgive her!
Forgive her!
She has been broken by the priest!
No blood where the tongue was pricked. True sign of the Devil.
Ladies!
Please!
And this said priest
Urbain Grandier, did debauch and defile my person six times between midnight and dawn on the night of May the 13th in the Year of Our Lord 1634.
And remember Sister, any attempt to retract all or part of this statement at any time will result in you being condemned not only in the next world, but also in this one as well.
Is she dead?
Cut her down!
Cut her down!
This is Grandier's work, my child!
You'll never be free of him until we've brought him to justice.
Oh Christ!
Christ help me!
I want...
Oh God I need...
I thought I had found You.
And now You have forsaken me.
The Baron de Laubardemont tells me you're ready to confess again, my dear Sister.
Yes. I want to make amends.
Grandier!
I've wronged an innocent man, Father!
My poor deluded child.
It is not you speaking but the devils within you.
Trying to protect Grandier.
The exorcisms have failed.
We must resort to other measures.
Did you sleep well?
With all this noise?
There are thousands out there. Where would you expect them to get the beds from?
Besides they're all too excited.
About what?
Oh...Your execution!
I have not been tried yet.
All right, have it your own way.
Your trial, then.
You're going to be tortured.
How is Madeleine?
I'm told she's putting the last touches to her confession of your mutual sins.
Good. Then I shall confirm her accusations.
Have you thought of the pain to come?
It cannot be different to the pain I have seen.
True. Except of course in its location.
It'll be in you, rather in your congregation.
I dread pain.
Well perhaps the judges'll think it unnecesssary.
Or perhaps as one who has sustained so much pleasure, you will take to pain, its ugly sister, without the usual noises of complaint.
I shall scream and admit to everything.
Oh, come Grandier!
A man like you?
All the more for that.
Why don't you offer up your pain to God?
You've lived by your senses, obviously you can die by them.
I will try, Baron.
I hope you will pray for me.
Oh I will, Father.
I will.
- And I will pray for you.
- You have one consolation:
Hell will hold no surprises for you!
May God have mercy on us both.
The evidence against you is irrefutable.
Your house has been searched.
Various manuscripts have been found.
Amongst them is this pamphlet, directed against
His Eminence Cardinal Richelieu.
You have also roused the temper of the populace against His Eminence by denouncing him in a public place.
Notebooks, and letters of a more... personal kind were also discovered.
A treatise on celibacy in the priesthood was found.
The man appears to have been in love when this was written.
We have also the written confession of his wife.
What have you done with her?
Too distressed by realisation of her guilt to give personal testimony that she went through a mock marriage ceremony with the accused in his own Church of Saint Peter's.
It was a real ceremony.
A simple act of committal done with my heart.
In the hope of coming to God through the love of a woman.
We have also letters from women who he did not marry.
One of which appears to suggest that he committed sexual intercourse under the very roof of the church itself!
For the love of Jesus Christ!
If you wish to destroy me, then destroy me!
Accuse me of exposing pol韙ical chicanery and the evils of the State, and I will plead guilty.
But what man can face arraignments on the idiocy of youth?
Old love letters and other pathetic objects, stuffed in drawers or in the bottom of cupboards?
Things kept for a day when he would need to be reminded... that he was once loved.
To continue the evidence...
My lords, we have heard testimony from sober citizens saying how they were bewitched by you into attending a Black Mass.
We have heard real devils speaking through the mouths of Ursuline nuns, swearing again and again that the accused is a sorceror!
And since when duly constrained by a holy exorcist, the Devil is bound to tell the truth, it follows that...
- Lies!
Lies and heresy!
The Devil is a liar, and the father of lies.
If the Devil's evidence is to be accepted, the virtuous people are in the greatest of danger, for it is against these that
Satan rages most violently.
I had never set eyes on
Sister Jeanne or the Angels until the day of my arrest.
But the Devil has spoken, and to doubt his word is sacrilege.
You have totally perverted
Christ's own teaching.
This new doctrine, de Laubardemont's new doctrine.
Barre's new doctrine, especially invented for this occasion is the work of men who are not concerned with fact, or with law, or with theology, but a political experiment to show how the will of one man can be pushed into destroying not only one man, or one city, but one nation!
This is not a political trial.
Remove the prisioner.
The Court will retire to consider its verdict.
Good morning, Mr. Surgeon!
Good morning to you.
Good morning, Mr. Chemist.
What have you got there?
It's a razor.
- Must it be this way?
- Yes, order of the court.
Well Mr. Surgeon... have all your studies and training brought you only to this?
To be a barber?
You're in no position to judge others.
Get on with it. The Court is waiting to pass sentence.
Just a minute.
Have you got a mirror?
- No, of course not.
Wait!
There's this.
Harken all good people to me,
for I've a tale of devils three.
The first was in the soul of a priest,
for he did bear the mark of a beast.
The next was in the heart of a nun,
and she was doomed as she'd begun.
The third stepped in a love so rare
inside of a maid so young and fair.
Oh harken all good people to me...
Silence in Court!
Urbain Grandier, you have been found guilty of commerce with the Devil.
And that you used this unholy alliance to possess, seduce and debauch certain Sisters of the Holy
Order of Saint Ursula.
You have also been found guilty of obscenity, blasphemy and sacrilege.
It is ordered that you proceed and kneel at the doors of Saint Peter's and Saint Ursula's, and there, with a rope round your neck, and a two-pound taper in your hand, ask pardon of God, the King and Justice.
Next it is ordered that you be taken to the marketplace, tied to a stake, and burned alive.
After which your ashes will be scattered to the four winds.
It has been decided that a commemorative plaque shall be set up in the Ursulines' chapel.
The cost of this, yet to be ascertained, will be chargable to your confiscated estate.
Lastly, before sentence is carried out, you will be subjected to the question, both ordinary and extraordinary.
Pronounced at Loudun, the 18th of August 1634 and executed the same day.
Have you anything to say?
My lords, I am innocent of the charges, and I am afraid.
But I have the hope in my heart that before this day ends,
Almighty God will glance aside and let my suffering atone for my vain and disordered life.
Amen.
- Amen.
Come! Confess your guilt! Tell us the names of your accomplices!
Then perhaps my lords the judges will show mercy.
I have no accomplices.
These cr韒es not my cr韒es.
Please stop this foolishness!
We both know why I have been brought to trial, and we both know why I have been found guilty.
Devil! Witch! Heretic!
Ignore him! What you see is not dignity, but pride.
Unrepetant pride! His calm is nothing but the brazenness of Hell!
Clear the Court!
It was not by us you were accused.
You were accused by Almighty God...
His son Jesus Christ thy Lord, who you challenged and crucifiied.
You were accused by the human race...
We humbly beg of Thee
Almighty God in Thy goodness, bless these instruments which Thou has created and given to us for our sacred use...
Devils in pieces of wood now, Barre?
If they are not driven out, your devils might by their infernal arts, prevent the torture from being as excruciating as it should be.
And then you would never confess, and your soul would be damned for Eternity.
Are you ready to confess?
I have been a man.
I haved loved women.
I have enjoyed power.
That's not what we want.
You've been a magician. You had commerce with devils.
I exorcise thee, Infernal Spirit, in the name of Almighty God, to depart from this man.
Confess! Confess!
Do you believe in your conscience that a man should confess to crimes that he has not committed, simply to ease his pain?
- Hit!
- Any confession? - He called on
God to give him strength.
His god is the Devil, and... it's made him insensible to pain.
Pay no attention to these tears.
They are the Devil's tears.
- Confess.
There are 6000 Christian souls waiting for you in the marketplace.
Tell me...
Do you love the Church?
- Not today. - Do you want to see it grow more powerful, more benevolent, until it embraces every human soul on this earth?
Then help us to achieve this great purpose.
Go to the marketplace a penitent man. Confess.
And by confessing, proclaim to those thousands that you have returned to the Church's arms.
By going to the stake unrepentant, you do God a disservice.
You give hope to unbelievers.
Such an act can undermine the very foundations of the Church.
You are no longer important. Think.
Are you any longer important?
I was never important.
Then make a last supreme gesture for the Catholic faith.
Go away, Laubardemont.
You are becoming tedious.
Do you know that the King has gone back on his word because of your crimes?
The walls will come down!
The city will be destroyed!
We have won.
- You have lost! - Won!
Sign it!
You will sign.
Get up!
What is this place?
The Convent of Saint Ursula.
A place you have defiled.
Do what must be done.
Ask forgiveness of Sister Jeanne and these good women you have wronged!
I have done no such thing.
I could only ask that
God will forgive them.
They have spoke of your beauty.
Now I see it with my own eyes and it's true.
Look at this thing that I am, and learn the meaning of love.
Devil!
Devil!
Devil!
Devil!
Oh God, to condemn in Thee
Judas Iscariot, the traitor, while he presses on Thee with perpetual flame!
- Push yourself!
- ...time to the wicked.
Depart from me.
Be cast into everlasting fire, which is prepared for the
Devil and his angels.
I must ask your forgiveness, priest, for what I must do.
But you can make a speech if you like.
And before the fire is lit,
I shall strangle you.
It will be quick, I promise you.
I exorcise you, in the name of Almighty God.
Confess! Confess!
Beg forgiveness!
Forgive me for defending your city so badly!
Confess! Confess!
See how he flinches? See how he denies his Redeemer?
Confess!
- I have finished confessing.
Give me the kiss of peace and let me die.
Kiss the Devil? Kiss the Evil Fiend, the Antichrist, the sink of all iniquity, all evil? Never!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss!
The Impious One and Thy angels have prepared the unquenchable fire.
- Kiss him!
Because thou art chief of accursed murder.
The head of sacr韑ege, the master of the worst actions.
The teacher of heretics.
The inventor of all obscenities.
Judas! Judas! Judas! Judas!
Judas! Judas! Judas!
Confess you are the Devil's servant!
Renounce your Master!
I am about to meet the God who is my witness.
And I have spoken the truth!
Confess! Confess!
You have only a moment to live!
Only a moment and then I go to that just and fearful judgement which you too, Reverend
Father, will soon be called.
May your body be consumed by eternal fire! - Wait, priest!
He's to be strangled.
I promised he was to be strangled!
Strangled! Strangled!
Is this what you promised me?
Where's the noose?
Where's the noose?
No! We need a noose!
The flames! I can't, the flames!
Sorry, priest! Sorry!
Burn! Burn!
Watch, bastard! See how your mother's honor was avenged!
Lucky little bastard!
It's not every day baby sees Daddy burn to death!
Don't look at me!
Look at your city!
Here your city is destroyed!
Your freedom is destroyed also!
Unrepentant to the last!
The fiend still speaks!
Confess! Confess!
If you would remain... free men, fight!
Fight them all or become their slaves!
I'm purging my own devils.
- What devils?
- Isacarel, Balaam...
They say they can stand up to the Church, but they can't stand up to this bitch.
Jeanne, you're being hysterical.
Where's Father Barre?
I was expecting him.
He's off to Poitiers.
A nun is reported to be having commerce with your Isacaron, in the form of a three-legged dog.
But there was going to be a public exorcism tomorrow in Saint Peter's.
Father Mignon could manage?
Father Mignon has been put away. He's quite demented.
He keeps babbling that we've destroyed an innocent man.
There was no signed confession to prove otherwise. Everyone has the same opinion.
Pity that.
Now with Grandier gone you are no longer possessed.
It's simple.
- What should I do?
Pray for salvation, do penance, stay here quietly of course.
What else...
There'll be a few tourists occasionally to brighten things up.
But that won't last long.
Soon the town will die, you'll be left in peace.
And oblivion.
Oh! I almost forgot...
Souvenir!
The Hindenburg is coming again.
That's what all the excitement is about.
In spite of protests like this...
the pride of Germany is due here on the morning of May 6.
During the 1937 season...
the giant airship is scheduled to make 18 round trips...
from Frankfurt to Lakehurst, New Jersey.
Just 150 years ago, the Montgolfier brothers, two Frenchmen...
made the first controlled flight in a hot-air balloon.
This rock-a-bye baby is perkin' along with a new gas: hydrogen.
Soon, an airborne banana split with four scoops.
In the Gay Nineties, ballooning really got off the ground.
Ladies, check the balloon sleeves on those stylish aeronauts in the basket.
By the early 1900s everyone agreed...
an airship should be shaped like a cigar.
Yes, sir, what the world needed was a good five-cent flying machine.
Alberto Santos-Dumont, a young Brazilian in Paris...
achieved a major breakthrough...
when he hooked a two-cylinder gasoline motor to the basket.
Flat tire, Alberto?
All the same, he went on to win the 100,000-franc prize...
for circling the Eiffel Tower in his 80-foot Tootsie Roll.
Next came the semirigid airship...
with a light metal frame supported by...
Oops!
Things are looking up.
These early birds have more varieties than Heinz.
Bigger and better airships, all of them air-conditioned...
continued to pop up before the World War.
The outdoor types.
With a girl along, that probably was more fun...
than the rumble seat of a Stutz Bearcat.
Around this time, a retired German army officer...
known as the crazy old
Count von Zeppelin...
flew a 400-foot sausage equipped with two marine motors for 20 miles.
But seriously, folks, after this amazing feat...
everyone wanted to be associated with the Zeppelin Company.
The count and a young associate,
Dr. Hugo Eckener...
founded the world's first air passenger line.
In 1924...
the Zeppelin Company built an airship for the U.S. Navy...
the LZ 126, rechristened "The Los Angeles".
Until last year the Graf Zeppelin...
was considered the marvel of the age.
Since 1928 she has carried 13,000 passengers over a million miles...
without a single mishap.
But then, at the Zeppelin Company works in Friedrichshafen...
German genius created the airship supreme: the Hindenburg.
Her vast, cathedral-like hull, almost three football fields long...
is an intricate web spun from more than ten miles of duralumin girders.
Fifteen stories high...
it houses 16 giant cells containing over 7 million cubic feet of hydrogen...
which lifts her 242 tons of luxury into the clouds.
She is the climax of man's dream to conquer the air...
the new queen of the skies.
The embassy received hundreds of letters like that last year, Mr. Ambassador.
Mostly from cranks.
We can expect many more this season.
Mrs. Rauch's letter is different.
It's specific.
She spells out how and where the zeppelin will be destroyed.
A time bomb over American territory.
- Franz.
- Erwin.
Showing us how you do it in Spain?
I'm afraid I don't fly very much there.
Good to have you back, Franz.
We hear they're giving you a Knight's Cross to your Iron Cross.
For writing up dossiers, I suppose.
Half the time on our own people.
They're turning us into a Gestapo, Erwin.
Get me out of Intelligence.
Get me back my Reconnaissance command.
That might not be easy, Franz.
Why not? All you have to do is sign the order.
You've been brought back for a special problem which we've inherited.
We've had our suspicions, Colonel... and now that letter confirms there is a plot to sabotage the LZ 129 on this flight.
Obviously, Dr. Goebbels, the sane thing to do is to cancel the flight... until the Gestapo uncovers the plot.
Sane but weak.
The propaganda value of the LZ 129 is highly important.
From a military standpoint, she's a flying dinosaur.
Colonel, the LZ 129 is a world symbol of Nazi power.
It is an honor to guard her safety, and you've been chosen.
My field is the estimation of enemy air operations, it's not espionage.
A zeppelin ride should be a vacation compared to Spain.
You're being loaned to the LZ 129... as the officer in charge of security for this trip.
You will have the power to do anything you think necessary... but quietly and discreetly... or it might appear we have internal opposition.
Ah. And you're afraid it might strengthen the resistance movement.
There is no resistance movement, Colonel.
That's reassuring coming from the Minister of Propaganda.
I mustn't keep you from your next appointment.
Let us hope that you will change your opinion of our "flying dinosaur."
Perhaps I will, unless there's an egg hatching in her.
The Hindenburg is scheduled to leave in two days, Colonel.
Why did the Gestapo wait till now to show us this?
It's inexcusable that our passengers have to make other travel arrangements this late.
- The flight hasn't been canceled.
- Not canceled? I thought...
- Why are you here?
- I'll be aboard.
A sort of special security officer.
I'd like you along, Captain Lehmann, as senior airship observer.
You may have to work with the Gestapo,
Colonel, but I don't.
You built the Hindenburg, Dr. Eckener.
Don't you want to protect your interests?
I've protected them for 40 years by taking no risks.
Even if I wanted to go, you'd never be able to clear it.
Dr. Eckener and I are out of favor at the chancellery.
I refused to name the
Hindenburg after the Fuhrer.
Captain Pruss, the new commander, is an excellent airshipman.
We trained him.
Don't embarrass yourself by requesting me, Colonel.
They won't allow it, and I prefer to leave it that way.
It's all arranged.
I'll see you at the airfield Monday.
Give me a break. Give me a break.
These stupid S.S. men crawling through our ship morning till night... with dirt on their shoes.
If we hid an elephant in the lounge, they couldn't find it.
They weren't looking for an elephant.
Did you see Karl when the S.S. dog barked?
He jumped ten feet, and the dog bit him in the brains... here!
Better than being bitten by the S.S.
You should've refused to go on that whale.
The crew might think I'm a Jonah.
I can't bear it.
Alfred, then Spain, now this.
We aren't far from Switzerland, Franz.
- I was walking along the river today and...
- No.
But you hate what you're doing now.
What would you have me tell them in Switzerland?
That yesterday I was a colonel in the German Air Force?
No. It'd be different if we were
Jews or pacifists, or even Communists.
- Uncle Gustaf is in Geneva.
- I can't.
I'd be a deserter.
Listen to me, Eleanore.
I spoke to Erwin.
He says he'll try to get my old group back.
We could live in the south, far from Berlin.
Poor Franz.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
The winner!
You'll be drunk, Karl!
We'll be dry for two days on board, woman.
Please, Karl. Not tonight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
Behave yourselves. You act like Gypsies.
Good night. Good night.
Stewardess, we're going to bed.
We'll ring if we need anything.
Excuse me. Excuse me. I beg your pardon.
I'm just a poor Gypsy.
That Freda Halle.
She's a loose woman.
They say she works for foreigners.
Some French bank in Frankfurt.
We should report it, Frau Knorr.
Look, it's women's gossip.
I mean, we're all loyal Germans.
Besides, that Karl is no fool.
Enough now.
I drink to the one I love.
The Hindenburg.
That song is going to make me sick.
Charlie! Yoo-hoo! We're over here!
It has wrecked more men, blasted more lives... and dishonored more ladies... than any other scourge on this earth.
I wish you'd forget this zeppelin crap and come on over to the coronation.
Quaky's rented a duke's palace outside London.
Not for us, Hattie.
Reed's finished the score on his new show.
- Rehearsals start the 12th.
- We couldn't possibly.
Besides, British quarantine won't let Heidi into the country.
You should've had children instead of dogs.
The evil spell's been lifted.
Bess is pregnant.
At your age?
- Finally.
- No rooftop announcements just yet. We...
We don't want to push our luck.
- Oh, Bess.
- Isn't it wonderful?
How long will you be away from us, Countess?
I suppose until I get homesick.
What is the purpose of your trip?
- To visit my daughter at school in Boston.
- Where will you be staying?
With friends.
Mr. and Mrs. Alden Winthrop.
In Boston?
Yes. And at their place on Cape Cod.
What does he do?
His occupation.
He's with the Winthrop
First National Bank... and I can assure you, Major, he is not the doorman.
Estelle, I've been looking all over for you.
Mr. Edward Douglas.
Cablegram for Mr. Douglas...
- I'm Mr. Douglas.
- Here, sir.
Thank you.
Will Mr. Kenji Shimura please come to the information desk.
Mr. Kenji Shimura, please come to the information desk.
Looks like we'll get off a little late.
Yeah. What's the holdup?
- Let's get this show on the road.
- I know I had it.
We're keeping all passports this trip, Countess.
They will be returned to you when we arrive at Lakehurst.
Oh. I see.
Your lighter will be returned after we've landed at Lakehurst.
The official photographer should know better.
If you'll just step into the booth for a body search.
It's company policy.
- Stay up here with me.
- Stay together.
Oh, Paul. So clumsy.
- Help Daddy.
- Thank you.
Your name is familiar, Mr. Breslau.
Do you have relatives in Germany?
Many friends and associates, but no relatives.
Well, now, you might have, Albert.
I've always been sure our name once had a "von." Von Breslau.
- That's Prussian nobility.
- That's where I've heard it.
Too bad, Mildred. The "von" doesn't count when you're born in the States.
- We all were.
- Me too.
Couple of cowboys, huh?
Come on, boys. Stay together.
Watch where you're going.
- Over here.
- That's a handsome cane, sir.
May I see it?
You wouldn't admire it so much if you were crippled.
I don't intend to be.
Would you tape the end of Mr. Bajetta's cane and return it to him, please?
- Yes, sir.
- You must be the special security officer.
It's a good thing too.
You know this ruddy blimp is filled with hydrogen?
I'll make a note of that. Thank you.
You call that dumb Dutchman a security man?
The tape is for your own safety, sir.
The steel tip could strike sparks.
I'd expect more courtesy on a cattle boat.
- Just do as you're told.
- May I help, Countess?
Franz.
- Are you on board?
- Yes.
What's wrong this trip?
These people insist upon going through all of my luggage and my trunk.
- Will you speak to them, please?
- Certainly.
Search it. Strip the lining.
Remove the metal corners.
If you run out of time, ship it to the countess on the Bremen.
Not very gallant, was it, Colonel?
The German Air Force is not at all what it used to be.
But then nothing is these days.
Nothing.
Hi! Nice dog!
Heil! Heil!
No, no.
Your papers, please.
Introducing the world's greatest, the one and only.
Here's my passport and ticket.
All in order.
Throw the bag on the zep, my boy.
Oh, goody. We are going to play doctor.
Why not?
Give it a thorough examination.
Also the suitcase.
Will Miss Breslau please write down her correct weight?
- I did. 106.
- Keep the pen.
It's a present from relatives in Germany.
Not a word to your father until after you've sailed. He'll understand.
We don't have any relatives in Germany.
My God, Lehmann.
- Are you suggesting I disobey orders?
- No, Pruss.
I'm saying the captain has the authority to cancel a flight... any time he doesn't think it's safe.
- You know our situation.
- I know that I don't believe much of it.
If you say there's a weakness on the new wrist pin on engine four... you have a valid reason for not taking off. I'll back you up on it.
Number four is perfectly reliable now.
The rest of your ship may not be.
No. It's out of the question, Lehmann.
The ship was searched twice today.
At least two Gestapo men on board that I know of.
And we have Colonel Ritter with us.
I'd look like a fool, or worse. No.
Oh, Ritter, come board with us.
Colonel, did you know we have the pleasure of Capt. Lehmann for this voyage?
- Just as an observer, Captain.
- And as a diplomat.
A worried diplomat.
Seems I'm to go to Washington to try to get us helium.
I wish we had it this trip.
To the right, please, Countess.
Excuse us, sir.
We'd like to look around a bit first.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll just put these in your cabin.
Come on. Let's go look in here.
I had no idea.
This is my favorite room.
Now if we could get a drink...
It has windows!
Colonel Ritter, your party has been contacted.
- I had to see you again.
- Yes?
I'll be back in six days.
Then we'll talk.
Everything's in order, sir.
Prepare to weigh off.
- Bye now!
- Have fun!
Drop lines.
Up ship!
Cable New York, Mitzi.
Remember, it's six hours different.
Happy landing!
Colonel Ritter.
Martin Vogel. Did you know?
We're cabin mates.
- Are we?
- Yes. I feel honored.
I hope the colonel doesn't mind sharing quarters with me.
Delighted.
Weather over the Channel.
If you fly the north side of the storm... the pressure pattern will simply push us over England.
The British don't want us over their chimney pots.
- They'll complain to the Foreign Office.
- Foreign Office isn't aboard.
I'll do the worrying this trip, Captain.
We'll stay on course and try to outrun the storm.
She's on her way, sir.
Left Frankfurt ten minutes ago.
8:18 by their clock.
- Now we sweat, Hank.
- Yes, sir.
- Till 6:00 a.m. Thursday.
- Listen to this.
"No voyager on the Hindenburg need fear fire from within the ship."
Et cetera, et cetera.
That's the same magazine that predicted
Landon would beat Roosevelt in 32 states.
That's why I read Ballyhoo exclusively, sir.
Every time she puts in here it's like walking on a crate of eggs.
A booby-trapped crate of eggs.
Remember what happened the last time we took the Los Angeles up?
Yes, sir. If we hadn't had helium, we wouldn't be here.
Have you found it, Colonel?
- Found what?
- There are no secrets on zeppelins.
Let's hope not.
- When do we eat?
- A light supper will be served at 10:00, sir.
It's important that you put me at Mr. Reed Channing's table.
I've been checking on his dog.
You should not have gone back there, Mr. Spah.
It's against regulations.
So, don't say anything.
Okay, comrade?
Well, I still say the French line has the best society.
Daddy.
There's something
I've been meaning to show you.
A young man at the airfield gave me this.
- He told me...
- Where did you get that?
- Daddy, I'm trying to tell you.
- Give it to me, dumpling.
Valerie, your father's right.
You shouldn't accept gifts from strange men.
- Mother!
- Enough.
She's a pretty little thing.
Only 4,000 miles to go.
I'd better meet her.
- Four thousand, one hundred.
- Excuse me?
- We've got 4,100 miles to go.
- Right.
Ah, Holland.
Nine minutes late.
Or do you make it ten, Mr. Douglas?
Bring me a beer, please.
When you are quite through, may I, Mr. Bajetta?
Only one damn lighter.
Hell on cigar smokers.
Filthy habit, cigars.
Oh, no.
Join me, Colonel?
Göring adores it.
But it's true, sir.
Right in there on the bar.
The pen stood upright for more than two hours.
That's how steady the Hindenburg flies.
Let's have a go at it ourselves, shall we? Who has a pen?
Do you mind, old boy?
- Uh, yes, I need my pen.
- Not for a few minutes, surely. Come along.
Fifty quid the bally pen will be toppled in less than an hour.
- Really, this is nonsense.
- Leave it. Be a sport.
- I'll take the bet.
- Righto. Anyone else?
Howell! You'll defend the honor of old Eli, won't you?
- It's Harvard.
- A hundred did you say.
Gentleman from Yale wagers $100.
I didn't say that. I said it's...
What would we bet, Colonel?
The honor of the Third Reich...
- also hangs in the balance.
- On so thin a thread.
Five hundred marks it stands eight hours.
I'll take that bet.
Will you watch it through the night with me?
- I told you, I need my pen.
- Sorry. All bets are off.
When they came to me,
I refused to do it.
They brought it to my daughter, but she didn't know what it was.
- Neither did my wife.
- Are your relatives Jews?
Damn you. Yes. My grandmother was a Jew.
Look here, Colonel. I import a lot of German surgical instruments.
You can bet the manufacturers... won't be so sensitive about my grandmother's background.
Mrs. Milstein.
Yes.
They wanted me to sell the diamonds so they could get out of Germany.
Does their name have to be a part of it now?
You know what could happen to them.
Just make sure that you declare those to U.S. Customs.
I'll keep the pen for the Gestapo museum.
It's all right.
Oh, yeah, when I saw your dog, it was doing fine.
That was real kind, Joe.
- Thank you, sugar.
- Oh, no, thank you. I never touch the stuff.
Over here, Captain. See it?
A clearing in the storm.
Alter course 30 degrees.
Head for that bright spot.
Forward engine to half speed.
We'll slow down in this turbulence.
That's how your American friends lost all their ships.
I would like to be in your new show, Mr. Channing.
I'm working on this new act. A zep act.
Real sophisticated.
Perfect for a show like yours.
- Oh, my...
- It's all right. It's okay.
Sugar, next time let's take the Titanic.
That pen incident.
It was obvious what you were looking for.
Obvious to me, at least.
I knew he was the kind for diamonds not bombs.
I could have told you about Breslau.
All the characteristics.
Brachycephalic skull, heavy lower jaw, skin...
Breslau happens to be just one-quarter Jewish.
The world is mongrelized, Vogel.
Only in Berlin is everyone so pure.
Well, we have all shapes of heads to choose from.
Can your X-ray eyes see inside them?
Major Napier, for one... who has no traceable income but makes frequent trips on luxury liners.
Good way to pick up information from important people.
Why suddenly the Hindenburg?
His big earlobes make me think he's a British spy.
There's no need for sarcasm, Colonel.
May I humbly suggest that
Mr. Edward Douglas also bears watching?
So very afraid we'll arrive late.
He's head of the foreign branch of an advertising company in Berlin.
Their big account is pharmaceuticals.
But he collected information from German plants that supply parts for the Hindenburg.
America also prepares for war.
He was naval intelligence during the last one.
Stayed abroad, went into advertising.
But he's careful not to advertise his business this trip.
- Joe Spah is just the opposite.
- Spah's just a clown.
A clown who canceled a performance for the Fuhrer... just to be on this flight.
Also spent a week in Moscow, just to see the Russian circus, he says.
Can't deny Spah has an unfriendly attitude.
A lot of people fail to see all our lovable qualities.
Which are well displayed in the countess.
How do you happen to know her?
Her husband and I were members of the same flying club... in the days before the Luftwaffe.
He was killed in a crash.
She went back to her estate.
I hadn't seen her in years.
A rich widow with an estate.
Yes, she's from a very distinguished North Baltic family.
Von Reugen from Peenemunde.
Peenemunde? At the mouth of the Oder?
- Owns half the island.
- Not anymore.
Peenemunde's just been taken over by weapons research.
Big new development in rockets.
If she knows what's going on there, it's risky letting her out of the country.
It's risky for the ship's photographer to step out of line with the countess.
If I were you, I'd find out how much she knows before I let her off this ship.
Leave that to me.
You stay away from her.
Tomorrow this photographer might take some pictures of the crew... find out what the common people are thinking.
They say the rigger, Karl Boerth... has a mistress who works in the Frankfurt branch of a French bank.
- Where did you hear that?
- I also hear she's been around.
Boerth is not the first.
Her name is Freda Halle.
I understand Boerth's a good man.
Hitler Youth leader.
By the way, am I also a suspect?
You?
Why, you're my staunch ally.
My teammate, my good right arm.
The Gestapo.
Ridiculous.
Where'd you get such an idea?
Detailed information on everyone except Martin Vogel.
All it says here is
"Official Hindenburg photographer."
Gestapo sources of information are really excellent.
Maybe not so good as you think.
It fails to mention that Colonel Ritter doesn't like Gestapo methods.
Doesn't use them himself... and doesn't want you operating behind his back.
That's why we're cabin mates.
I'm sorry, Dr. Luther.
Captain Lehmann is wasting his time coming here.
Well, perhaps this at least will persuade State... to make arrangements for appointments for him.
You know how Congress feels about helium.
They're afraid that Chancellor Hitler will use it for military...
What's been done about this?
Everything possible to guarantee the safety of the Hindenburg.
The chief danger to her is the American monopoly of helium.
Now, if anything does happen,
Mr. Handford... it could be blamed on your country.
Would you step outside for a moment, Lessing, please?
Certainly, Colonel.
Get this off to Gestapo
Headquarters, Berlin.
Attention: Hochwald.
Send results
Freda Halle surveillance so far.
Also run check on her lovers before Boerth.
Signed, Ritter.
Destroy that after it's sent.
- Record the message by code number.
- Yes, sir.
I don't like the dog so far away.
- Suppose something happens.
- Impossible, Mr. Channing.
Your dog is traveling first class.
Better than some of the passengers.
- You see? She agrees.
- Kirsch.
What are you doing bringing passengers into the interior of the ship?
Colonel, when we bought our tickets we were told we could visit the dog.
That may be, Mr. Channing, but the ship's interior is now... no matter how much anyone tips.
So, please.
Damn it, I'm going to visit my dog.
Passengers are barred for their own safety.
Take a look, Mr. Channing.
If you fell, you'd go right through, into the sea.
Rot.
Last year passengers were permitted inside the hull, but not this voyage.
Typical. You're running this ship like a concentration camp.
- I agree that I am running this ship.
- Go to hell.
I take it back. That would be a lot better than Germany is today.
I'm curious as to why people like yourselves would choose the Hindenburg.
If you must know, only because my wife is...
Well, she... she gets sick on boats.
The Zeppelin Company couldn't ask for a better recommendation.
I'll assign the cabin boy to visit your dog every watch... and report to you. Fair enough?
Why don't we talk about the arrangements for your concert.
Do you really think
I'm going to go through with that?
I announced the concert.
I'm sure you won't disappoint us.
Okay. You're the captain.
You want a concert,
I'll give you a concert.
Take her down below the fog layer, Hans.
But no lower than 200 meters.
By all means, come right in, Franz.
Where did you get the lighter?
Our radio operator is hot-blooded.
Give it to me, Countess.
Behave, Ursula. You know it's dangerous.
Franz, I've learned a new game: breaking all the rules.
It's much more fun for people like us... than those shoe clerks and butchers in their brown shirts... because, my darling, we made the rules.
I made this one.
Go ahead. Take it.
Help yourself to anything else.
That's the official policy now, isn't it?
- They've taken my house and my land.
- So I heard.
- How generous of you.
- Generous? I screamed bloody murder.
Oh, Franz, if I told you what was going on in Peenemunde...
You don't know. No one knows.
If they thought you knew, you would never be allowed out of the country.
Listen to me.
No questions asked or answered.
You have made a great sacrifice for the Fatherland.
Do you understand me?
Good.
Why anyone would want that wretched island I'll never know.
Did I tell you, Franz,
I managed to get rid of it?
Trudi will be delighted.
Oh, Franz, she's growing up so nicely.
She'll be at the airfield.
Perhaps you'll see her.
Beautiful child.
I heard you say she was going to school in Boston. That's marvelous.
And doing very well.
It's the best school for the deaf, I'm told.
She's learning to speak and lip-read.
Maybe this summer we'll...
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Where are you?
What is this? What is all that?
It's atmospheric pressure.
Yes! Stuart, I want my things out of the safe.
It's making me choke.
What is this? What is all this?
Oh, thank God, it's going away.
Please, please, don't, uh... don't be upset.
You've just been treated to a harmless display of St. Elmo's fire.
- What's that?
- As the ship came through the fog... we accumulated an electrical charge... like a child shuffling his shoes across a carpet.
We've been in no danger.
The ship is completely bonded together... and the charge was dissipated harmlessly.
- Thank you.
- I was pretty sure... it was St. Elmo's fire all along.
Personally, I could use a little shot of something.
Marvelous sensation on an airship.
Floating.
Timeless.
Past, present, no difference.
They all seem to run together here.
Don't you find it so, Franz?
- Do you still play cards, Countess?
- Why?
Major Napier and Mr. Bajetta pique my professional curiosity.
I've been propositioned frequently... but this is the first time I've ever been recruited by the German Luftwaffe.
That is what you're doing, isn't it, Franz?
Yes. With apologies.
I'll give you ten percent of my winnings.
You probably remember,
I'm good at games of chance.
You're in the right place.
Well, that's an odd thing to say.
It's obviously some kind of private code.
In any case, we'll see the answer before Douglas does.
- That gives us an advantage.
- True.
Go ahead and send it.
Spah made this sketch of the ship's interior.
- See if you can open this.
- Standard combination.
Now what do you think of your pet clown?
I think we better watch him more closely.
Simple for a man who knows his job.
Douglas got rid of that airport telegram very quickly.
We'll have to wait for the answer to the one he sent.
How long is this concert supposed to last?
No telling. However, I asked the captain to arrive 15 minutes late.
A coding device.
I've never seen one quite like it.
Luftwaffe Intelligence has been too busy sunning themselves in Spain.
"Operation 'K'." What do you suppose that stands for, Vogel?
"Kraut"? "Knockwurst"? "Kosher"?
What more do you need to question Napier and Pajetta?
My orders are to move quietly.
Besides, when you surface a spy, and he doesn't know it... you can turn him to your own advantage.
With your permission, Captain...
I would like to play for the first time in public... a little number from my upcoming show... and Mr. Joe Spah has kindly agreed to take part in this little entertainment.
I hope you like it. Captain.
- Mr. Spah.
- Mr. Channing.
- Danke schön.
- De nada.
Thank you so much, Mr. Channing.
Unfortunately, your humor is not the same as ours.
Good night, sir.
It was really surprising.
Oh, it's you, Boerth.
What the devil were you doing up there?
- Routine inspection, Colonel.
- Inspecting what?
Control cables, sir. A rigger's duty.
Is there anything
I can help you with, sir?
I understand you were a Hitler Youth leader.
Yes, sir.
But you haven't been active for the last two years.
Only because of the Hindenburg, sir.
I helped build her in Friedrichshafen... and last year I made all ten trips.
If there's nothing else, sir,
I'll get on with my duties.
Boerth!
I wonder what you were really doing, Boerth.
MY duty, sir.
We're from the F.B.I., Mrs. Rauch.
We'd like to talk to you.
G-men? Oh, Lordy, Lordy!
- You sure you got the right party?
- Yes, ma'am.
But...
Then you confirm that that is your letter... in your own handwriting, to the German ambassador?
I certainly do, and everything in it will happen just like I say.
Tomorrow the zeppelin will fly over New York City and blow up.
- I know it for a fact.
- How, Mrs. Rauch?
Because two weeks ago I saw it in a vision, clear as crystal.
I'm clairvoyant, and I'm never wrong.
Just ask any of the neighbors.
I also predict that Bette Davis... will play the part of Scarlett O'Hara in the movie... and the Duke of Windsor will never marry Mrs. Simpson.
Read it from the shorthand.
"Checking information that former lover of Freda Halle... was killed fighting for Leftists in Spain.
Signed, Hochwald."
To Hochwald.
Is there any information regarding bomb from Halle?
Have several suspects, but I need evidence. Ritter.
Magnificent. Icebergs!
They're too far away to photograph.
Will you turn around?
- I never dreamed we'd see icebergs.
- That's interesting.
Where've you been, George?
Look at the icebergs.
Makes you feel like an explorer flying over the pole.
You still play beautifully.
Only I wish you were playing cards.
3:00 this afternoon.
You won't say anything about me bringing her down here, will you?
Oh, hell, I've been doing it since we left.
- What kind of dog is she?
- She's a dalmatian.
She used to follow behind carriages, didn't you, girl?
She needs a lot of exercise.
- Cover on port fin ripped loose, sir.
- Engines three and four, idle.
Forward engines to quarter speed.
- Suppose I go aft and take a look.
- Go ahead.
Right. Yes. Right.
- Hold her into the wind.
- Captain, we're losing altitude.
- We're heavy. Picked up rain in the squall.
- More power, sir?
No. The riggers would be swept overboard by the wind.
- What's the altitude now?
- Three hundred fifty meters, sir.
- Rate of descent?
- Ten meters a minute.
That gives them about, uh... 25 minutes.
- Hold him!
- Got him!
Foot on the bar! On the bar!
- Lift him up!
- Put your feet down here.
- All right. Hold him.
- Put me down on the girder.
Damn!
Jesus! Looks bad.
It's all right. Let's go.
Altitude: 280 meters.
Can't risk going below 100.
Altitude: 260 meters.
Now losing 15 a minute.
Forward engines to half.
Little more breeze won't blow them away, Oster.
We'll gain some lift in a couple of minutes.
Forward engines, half speed.
You've only got about 15 minutes.
You sew, Karl. You're faster.
What exposure are you using, Mr. Shimura?
- Five-six.
- Five-six.
Thank the Lord I brought this camera.
Look, darling. It's gorgeous!
- Stepped on the line.
- Did not!
That's worth the whole trip.
It's breathtaking.
It's all right to tell the captain he can go on now.
- We have all the pictures we want.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Go back inside. Look after your eye.
- Just finish up.
Stand by, Dimmler. When we're down to 100, I want all engines full speed.
Get the riggers inside.
Knorr! Boerth!
No more time. Back inside.
- It's still too big. It'll rip.
- Captain's orders! Back inside!
Karl!
One rigger's still outside, Captain.
Boerth.
- Captain. Boerth is still outside.
- I heard you, Dimmler.
All engines full ahead.
Nose up five degrees.
Knorr? Knorr, I'm going off!
Pull me!
Pull me!
You're all right, Karl. Come on.
She's about seven hours late.
I assure you, madame, there's no need to worry.
She's right there, 100 miles off the coast of Newfoundland.
Then they won't be landing till tomorrow afternoon.
I suggest you come back tomorrow morning.
We'll know much better by then.
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.
- Mr. Douglas.
- Oh. Thank you.
I'll take that to the radio room for you, Mr. Douglas.
No, thank you. I'll do it myself.
- But, sir, passengers aren't allowed to...
- I know, I know.
Here's my special pass. Thank you.
I'd like to see you, Mr. Douglas.
How 'bout a drink later?
Now!
- What's this strong-arm stuff?
- Come on.
You'd better tell me about this, Mr. Douglas.
While you're at it, explain these, in code.
I don't have to explain a damn thing to you. Get out.
Better set it back to Frankfurt time.
That's where a fast police car will be meeting you... in roughly 94 hours, barring accidents, of course.
Okay, I'll tell you, Ritter, but you've gotta let me send that message.
It may mean the difference.
- To what?
- To pulling off the biggest deal of my life.
Right now, I'm in a race.
A race to beat my competitor into New York.
- Who?
- Fred Seemans, head of Seemans and Poelzig.
At this moment, he's on the Queen Mary... which left a day and a half ahead of us.
In the messages, we call his outfit the Sharks... mine the Hawks.
One by air and one by sea and both carnivorous.
You're beginning to get the idea.
Tomorrow it'll be announced that General Motors has acquired... the Opel Motor Company.
The advertising account will be up for grabs.
Whoever gets there first will have the jump.
All right. Let's see if there's a Fred Seemans on board the Queen Mary.
Yeah?
- Hi, Captain.
- Three hours. Where ya been, Baker?
All ya had to do was phone the steamship line.
That was the easy part.
"The individual, Frederick Seemans, is on board the Queen Mary... occupying suite 312, first class, 'C' deck."
It's the others that took the time.
Operation "K," Passage,
Raid and Mr. Chandu.
You know who they are?
You're gonna tell me any day now, aren't ya, Baker?
- They're horses, Captain.
- What?
Well, you see, it had me stumped.
So I contacted the F.B.I., and was my face red.
These are the names of racehorses.
Why does some German on a zeppelin want us to find out about the ponies?
You got me.
Maybe he's heard:
New York cops make book.
Maybe he thinks he can and win himself a bundle.
Well, that's near Lakehurst.
Two of these nags are runnin' tomorrow.
Operation "K" and Mr. Chandu.
Well, send them the odds.
That's probably all the guy wants, anyway.
Think so?
Which two horses?
I need it for the record.
Hi, Tommy.
You boys are goin' out to beautiful Jersey.
Special request of the State Department.
This time they got a Luftwaffe colonel aboard, name is Ritter.
Big wheel with Intelligence.
Comin' to land a couple of espionage agents, maybe?
Don't you experts let any goddamn Nazis slip into the country.
That blimp better not fly too low over them Jersey woods.
Full of moonshiners. They'll shoot any big-ass bird flyin' over their stills.
Yeah, the T-men are also sending a special Customs squad.
- Byrnes Duncan will be with them.
- Duncan?
He's with the Bureau of Explosives.
Oh, thanks a lot.
Now we get the picture.
That's right.
It's very nice to see you again.
Have you been playing long?
Ah. I thought we might be able to find time to relax... now that the famous Rauch letter turns out to be from a crank.
The Gestapo often exaggerates their information.
- Are you building this?
- Yes.
It's my own design for a house in Zeppelinheim... the new village near the airfield.
We're hoping our airship families will settle there.
Come.
- For you, Colonel.
- Thank you.
It's from the Gestapo.
Boerth's woman has been arrested.
She's confessed that her ex-lover was killed... fighting for the Leftists in Spain.
In the hands of the Gestapo, anyone can be made to confess anything.
Yes. In bed with his mistress,
Boerth could have been talked into a plot.
What plot, Colonel?
A crank letter has been made into a matter of state.
The purpose of exaggerating the bomb scare was to get helium.
- I went along with that.
- There are other sources of information.
Perhaps no more valid than the letter.
Well, I'm not a believer in the occult like our Mrs. Rauch... but I'll tell you, Captain,
I have an uneasy sense of disaster.
As if a bomb were ticking inside me.
It's a constant feeling with some people in Germany these days.
A decent man like you, Colonel... with a wife, probably raising a family.
Have you never had this feeling before?
"Probably raising a family."
My only son was killed three months ago working for the new order.
But believe me, Captain, I'm not much better working for the Gestapo... one of their spies lying in bed above me.
What's happening to people like us?
I've given my life to zeppelins.
Last year, for the sake of our company...
I even dropped political pamphlets from this ship.
Where does it stop?
I've been in the air force since the World War.
When the Versailles Treaty abolished it...
I worked with Göring and the others to build a secret one.
I remember those days.
You people trained in gliders.
Yes, all over Germany, mostly at night.
I was proud when Hitler brought the new Luftwaffe out into the open.
I wasn't proud after last week.
Guernica. A little Basque village.
A few hundred peasants.
We dropped 3,000 bombs on it.
You were there?
Chief of Intelligence.
So that's how one wins the Knight's Cross in peacetime.
"Peacetime."
Well, now we have two heroes aboard.
Boerth did valiant service to the Hindenburg today.
He doesn't seem to be the man to destroy the ship.
He does to me.
He's exactly the kind of man I would choose for a dangerous mission.
Bold, tough, cool.
You have those qualities in common with him.
You're both good men.
I must get to know him better.
Please show this to Pruss. Thank you for the coffee, Captain. Good night.
I, uh... hope you get your house built.
Freda Halle has been arrested.
Traffic violation?
- No, by the Gestapo.
- Because she works for foreigners?
- Because I think she works with you.
- She lives with me.
She's admitted that your... predecessor has been killed in Spain.
- So?
- If she knows about the bomb... they'll make her confess that too.
Where is it, Boerth?
They'll work on Freda until you tell me.
You filth.
No worse than the filth who wants to blow up 97 people.
But you won't have a chance, because I'm locking you up.
- You're under arrest. Let's go
- Ritter, get your hands off me.
Get your hands off me, or I'll blow it up now.
You can't stop it.
I can make it go any second.
Don't force me, Ritter.
I need you to help me.
For Ritter. Get it to him immediately.
He's hard to find.
Prowls all over the ship.
Boerth, where is it?
The Gestapo knows about the bomb.
This ship is the Nazis' greatest propaganda weapon.
You patched her up today for your own propaganda.
No good if she simply tumbled into the sea, hm?
No politics in an act of God.
No survivors either.
But that's not how I plan to do it.
It'll happen at the mooring mast at Lakehurst.
A hydrogen airship?
That's deliberate murder.
The Luftwaffe in Spain is deliberate murder, and that's practice for Hitler.
You people are going to save the world by blowing up the Hindenburg.
It's a place to start.
It'll prove there is a resistance.
Decent Germans will get the courage to join us... and no one has to be killed if you help me.
You're the key to this...
- Boerth, is that Col. Ritter with you?
- Coming.
Colonel, a message for you.
I have a date with my little Jewish model.
I'm curious to try one before they're all gone.
Cologne won't help you.
Why didn't you arrest Boerth?
Pruss showed me the message.
I'm still looking for a bomb. Arresting
Boerth won't keep it from going off.
It will, damn it, if you make him talk.
Your thumbscrews didn't make
Freda Halle talk about a bomb... before she was shot while trying to escape.
That was the mistake of a stupid guard.
You're making a worse one.
- Arrest Boerth, Spah, Douglas, all of them.
- Brilliant, Vogel.
The Hindenburg will come into Lakehurst like a prison ship.
I can see the headline.
"Anti-Nazi Plot on Zep."
There are ways to keep it quiet.
If it offends your delicacy,
I'll handle it for you.
Do as you're told.
I'll take care of Boerth.
You watch Napier and Spah and, of course, your little model.
- I'll also be watching you.
- Fine. Who'll be watching you?
I'm really disappointed, Colonel.
We thought after the splendid example of your own son that you would personify...
Gentlemen, new time of arrival: 5:00 p.m.
Now you reporters can go back to the gin mills.
I'll ask the police and the security officers to stay on, though.
All right, boys, get 'em while they're hot.
- Who needs a passenger list?
- I'll take one. Thanks.
There's a real pair. Napier and Pajetta.
- You know those men, Sergeant?
- Sure do.
The Major and Emilio "The Cane."
They're boatmen.
Uh, cardsharps.
Usually work the luxury liners.
Real characters.
I'm supposed to check the copper tubing on the airship, sir.
Are those guys kidding about a bomb?
That's very funny.
- Hey, look!
- Yeah.
Ah, yes. Rainbows like that are very common in airship travel.
Hey, Dad.
- Did you see it?
- What?
It's nothin', Dad.
Rainbows like that are very common in airship travel.
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah.
- Are you with me?
- I have something to tell you.
I have no time for you. The ship and I have six and a half hours left.
It concerns Freda Halle.
- Gestapo?
- Killed while trying to escape, they say.
Boerth?
I know, Boerth.
I... lost my son last March.
My only child.
He was in the Hitler Youth.
He went out to have some fun one night.
Paint slogans on a synagogue.
Alfred was on the roof, he slipped and fell. His neck was broken.
Your son died for Hitler.
Isn't that enough for you?
Plenty. I don't want
97 more dead on this ship.
I told you. It will happen at the mooring mast. No one aboard.
My God, that's the last thing I want.
Ask Lakehurst for marines to cordon off the ship.
Keep everyone at least 50 yards away.
I would have to see the bomb, know how it works.
No. You have a wife at home.
What time do I set the bomb for?
I've got to see it.
Too much can go wrong.
Just see that the ship is empty.
What time do I set the bomb for?
Ritter, I can do it without you very easily.
The ship lands at 5:00.
All the passengers off at 5:30.
Another half-hour to unload the freight and the mail.
Liberty party leaves at 6:30.
Remaining crew will eat at the naval station mess.
Captain Fellows's dinner party for the officers at 7:00.
Anyone standing watch I'll evacuate.
I'll say... U.S. Customs search, something.
No supplies or fuel or hydrogen will be loaded until after 8:00.
What time?
You'll leave with the liberty party.
Disappear into New York.
- I'm staying aboard.
- That can't help Freda now.
In the last few seconds I'm sending out a radio signal that it was no accident.
What time?
- Check.
- Check.
- I bet a hundred.
- Ohh, the lady's out for blood, eh?
I use it to polish my fingernails.
I'm out.
I'll, uh... see you and raise you.
And I'll raise you, sir.
And I'll see you both.
Well, I'm afraid that lets me out.
Full house.
Sorry it's not strip poker, Countess.
You'd be looking for a fig leaf.
Straight flush.
Well, we live and learn.
Well, once more into the breach, dear friends.
Spah was in the hull again, and the stewardess found these in the cabin.
Excellent, Martin.
This could mean he's working for someone else, someone who needs these.
- Who?
- That's the man I want you to find... after we, uh... take care of these two.
What happened to the tape, Mr. Pajetta?
Since when have you become the local house detective?
I deputized him.
Until we land, you and Major Napier will be confined to your cabin.
- Come along.
- What about the game?
You can play hearts with Mr. Pajetta in the cabin.
You're going to regret this, sir.
- My nephew is very close to Mussolini.
- Thank you both.
May I send a bottle of Chianti to your cabin?
Madame, what you can do with that bottle of Chianti...
I won't say in front of these gentlemen.
Well, Countess, I never thought
I'd enjoy losing so much.
Thank you, dear Franz, for the assignment.
I made enough to fill 20 trunks.
How did you do it?
They cheat. I believe they earn their living that way.
The cane.
- Pajetta taps out signals with it.
- And you still won?
I managed to scramble their signals.
I'd say your ten percent was worth several cases of champagne.
- Shall we start drinking it up?
- Better send it to me.
I'll celebrate my homecoming in a bath of champagne.
I'd love to join you, Franz.
- But I'm not going back.
- I know.
Who tries to bring a wardrobe trunk aboard a zeppelin?
Oh, dear sweet Franz.
It's all so depressing, isn't it?
This helps a little.
It's not what I need now. Thanks.
No, it's a poor substitute.
It makes no sense at all, does it, Franz?
That you and I ever met.
I'll see you to say good-bye.
Kirby. Kirby!
Check over your procedures for a high landing.
Pruss just sent word he's gonna try one.
Pruss is nuts!
An electric front's moving in.
Well, he's gonna try it.
And, Kirby, when she's hooked up, slip her nose into the cup real easy.
Just keep remembering, there's seven million cubic feet of hydrogen... at the end of our fishing pole!
My God, the Queen. I've had it.
Not necessarily.
We land at Lakehurst at 5:00.
She's just taking on her tugs.
Boerth, what's there?
- Find something, Karl?
- That patch looked weak.
Must have loosened when the outer skin ripped.
I reinforced it.
I'm sure it's secure now.
Uh-huh. Well, come on.
The chef's got sandwiches waiting for us.
Well, Bisma refused us that detachment of marines.
Did you tell him the score?
He knows the score.
It was quite a battle.
He called the Hindenburg a flying crematorium.
Doesn't want his men near it.
Damn. I hope Washington gives Lehmann the helium.
- Mr. Dimmler.
- Yes.
I just found this stuck in the catwalk.
Jesus. Any damage?
- No, I don't think so, sir.
- Something wrong?
Ludecke just found this in the catwalk.
Some idiot must've dropped it.
Who does it belong to, Ludecke?
- I don't know, sir.
- He didn't report it? Damn fool.
A knife dropped inside the hull could cause sparks... damage a wire, control cable.
Christ knows what.
We've got to find out who owns that knife and why he didn't report it.
We want to see your knives.
Your knife, please, Karl.
Ludecke found this in the hull a few minutes ago.
He doesn't have it.
I left it on my bunk when I went to wash up.
Someone must've borrowed it.
Please forgive my appearance, Captain.
- Is this yours?
- No, sir.
Can you prove it?
My knife has a nick in the guard from that fight we got in in Shanghai... when we went around the world on the Graf.
Arrest him, question all of them.
Arrest me, Captain, because my knife was borrowed?
Enough of this stupid business.
Get dressed and go to your landing station, Chief.
- Yes, sir.
- You men too.
I trust the men in the Zeppelin family.
That's at least 25 knots.
Hell, they're only showing surface winds.
What's happened to gusts?
They can't get it fixed, sir.
Flash red, damn it. Flash red.
Signal red, Captain.
Thank you kindly.
I thought it was a Christmas tree.
Send this to Fellows.
Riding out weather. Shall delay landing until further notice from N.A.L.
Looking forward to dinner. Pruss.
Make sure the dog is unloaded as soon as we land, all right?
Here's a little something extra for you.
You have been a doll.
That's okay, Mrs. Channing.
I like dogs. Thanks, anyway.
- Well, lovely.
- It's a set for my zeppelin act.
I had better ones, but they disappear from my cabin.
Somebody's trying to steal my act.
That's how good it is.
Joe, I've gotta be honest with you.
It's not right for my show.
You don't like it, huh?
Well, I guess it's back to the circus.
- Joe?
- Yeah.
You forgot this one.
It's just a drawing that I made of the crazy rainbow for my kids.
- How many children do you have?
- Three.
One seven, one four, and a baby boy who's gonna be an acrobat.
Believe you me, we have circus enough at home.
I'll bet.
Anyhow, it's been a great honor to know people like you.
- Thank you, Joe.
- We had some fun, huh?
- Yeah.
- Good-bye.
Reed, I'd like to see Joe's act.
Okay, little mother.
I guess we'll give him an audition sometime next week.
Good.
- This is absurd!
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm sure it's just a technicality that will be straightened out before we land.
- I want my passport this instant, Kirsch.
- It's not here, Countess.
It's been picked up.
Same thing happened to a friend of mine in Italy.
You wouldn't believe the excuse they gave him.
Franz.
- They've picked up my passport.
- On whose orders?
Yours, maybe.
Who else knows about Peenemunde?
You're the...
It's only a little storm, Countess.
In an hour you'll be laughing about it with your daughter.
In fact, I'm going to escort you from the ship personally... to make sure that I see her. All right?
- We want to see your knife.
- You've seen my knife. I'm busy.
Come on!
- This is Knorr's knife, isn't it?
- The hell it is.
A nick on the guard like Knorr said.
You stole it when you broke your own.
- What were you doing?
- It's my knife!
- You're lying.
- You can't arrest me without Ritter.
Watch.
Vogel, you Gestapo idiot.
You're making the mistake of your life.
Captain, some of the passengers are getting nervous.
How long will it be before we land?
Whenever Naval Air at Lakehurst gives us the green light.
- When do you estimate that'll be?
- Tell the passengers... we'll land when conditions are right and not a minute sooner.
Three degrees out of trim.
Light in the bow.
Drop ballast aft. Two hundred kilos.
Yes, she does feel tail-heavy, Captain.
She's tail-heavy because wind drove the rain aft.
The moisture will evaporate in a few minutes.
When we're over the field, how long will it be before
- The passengers are certain to ask.
- A high landing takes 15 minutes.
Allow another 20 to disembark passengers.
Um, I understand the Countess's passport is being held.
Rotten. Vogel said it was a matter of internal security.
- Vogel took it?
- What's the matter with you, Ritter?
I assume you know what's going on in your own department.
Yes, sir, I do.
If the wind shifts... have your linesmen hang on until the main wire comes down.
Boerth?
I'm looking for Boerth.
Have you seen him?
I need him too. Try the north section.
- What's that?
- That's just a worn place we patched.
I'm sure it's secure.
All right, but let's have a man watch this bag till we're on the ground.
Yes, sir.
Boerth? Boerth!
Send a Decca. Recommend landing now.
Ground crew is ready.
Reply to N.A.L. Proceeding to land.
Will be late for dinner.
Apologies to madam. Signed Pruss.
I'm uneasy about cell four, Captain.
We might have to make a major repair before going back.
We'll see. Landing stations.
Two degrees light in the bow and tail-heavy.
Six men from the off watch into the bow.
- Have you seen Boerth?
- No, Colonel.
No, sir. He should be here.
- Wind shifted to the west.
- Gusts?
- No reading on gusts.
- No wonder they lose all their airships.
Hard rudder to port.
Aft engines, full astern.
Line up with her, knuckleheads!
Move your butts!
She'll keep her nose to the wind!
Come on. Move it!
Where's Boerth?
His landing station's in the nose.
Ship in trim but rising slightly.
Valve all cells, five seconds.
Stand by for starboard line drop.
Beautiful. Level as a board.
- Pruss is really showin' us how.
- The ship is standing still now.
Everything seems remarkably still.
She hovers just short of the mast, waiting for her nose cone to be connected up.
A great floating palace.
Please, Mr. Douglas, you have to leave.
I'm closing up.
So we're finally landing.
That calls for another drink.
I should have taken a rowboat.
Neuhaus, we've got a jammed cable.
Come bear a hand.
Out, Ritter. I've taken over.
Out!
Boerth! Boerth, it's Ritter!
It's 7:20. Where's the bomb?
He stole my knife.
Listen to me.
There's less than ten minutes left.
We're all gonna die. Where's the bomb?
Repair patch four.
Ritter!
No. No!
It burst into flame! It burst into flame and it's falling, it's crashing!
Watch it! Watch it!
Get out of the way, please!
Get out of the way! Get this, Johnny!
Some landing.
Run! Run! Get outta there!
Hold it! Hold it! Stand fast, damn it!
No, Dimmler, don't drop ballast!
Let the stern fall.
Give them a chance to get out back there.
Oh, my God!
Down the stairs. Come on.
Here! Give me that!
- Fire extinguishers!
- Come on! Fire extinguishers!
Stay with me. Help me.
Hurry! Grab those ropes!
- No! I can't! I can't!
- Jump! Jump! Please!
- My babies! No!
- Jump!
It's your only chance!
Oh, no! No! No!
Come on!
- Jump!
- Come on, jump! Hurry!
Come on! Come on!
- Get up! Jesus, run!
- Get outta here!
Come on! Jump! Don't be afraid!
Couple of yellow-bellies!
Are you gonna let a girl be braver than you are?
Run!
Come on! Your brother did it!
You can do it too!
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!
- You're all right.
- Oh, my God! My God!
Sailor! Help him out!
This way!
Major! Emilio!
- I was afraid your luck had run out on ya!
- It's a miracle anybody's alive.
All right, get outta here!
Come on, get out!
Take care of yourselves! Go ahead!
Thank you!
All right. Turn on the water.
Trudi! Trudi!
Oh, my baby! Oh, thank God!
Lehmann.
Ernst.
What happened, Ernst? Ernst.
Ernst!
How did it happen?
Colonel Franz Ritter, dead.
Rigger Karl Boerth, dead.
S.S. Captain Martin Vogel, survived.
Captain Max Pruss, survived.
Captain Ernst Lehmann, dead.
Albert Breslau, dead.
Mildred Breslau, survived.
Edward Douglas, dead.
Elliott Howell III, dead.
Dead. Survived. Dead.
Dead. Dead. Survived.
Survived. Dead. Dead.
Dead. Survived.
In all, 13 passengers,
22 members of the crew...
one navy linesman, dead.
Sixty-two survivors.
The final report of the board of inquiry states:
"The most plausible theories for the Hindenburg disaster are:
Structural failure, static electricity
St. Elmo's fire, sabotage."
No completely certain proof has been found...
for any of the possibilities cited.
The German commission report goes a step further.
It states: "The possibility of deliberate destruction...
must be admitted since no other originating cause can be proven."
However, the new Reich could not admit...
that a resistance, much less a single saboteur...
had brought down the great symbol of Nazi power.
Chancellor Hitler concluded therefore that it was an act of God.
During the investigation, the eyewitness account recorded by Herb Morrison...
for radio station WLS Chicago was heard many times.
...standing still now.
The back motors of the ship are just holding it, just enough to keep it from...
It burst into flame! It burst into flame and it's falling, it's crashing!
Watch it! Watch it!
It's crashing! Terrible!
Oh, my! Get out of the way, please!
It's burning... bursting into flames and it's falling on the mooring pad...
and all the folks agree that this is terrible!
This is one of the worst catastrophes in the world!
Oh, it's... This place is...
Oh, four or five hundred feet into the sky it...
It's a terrific crash, ladies and gentlemen.
The smoke and the flames now, and the frame is crashing to the ground...
not quite to the mooring mast.
Oh, the humanity, and all the passengers screaming around here!
I told you...
I can't even talk to people...
whose friends are on there.
It's... It's... It's, uh... Oh!
I can't talk, ladies and gentlemen.
I can't...
Listen, folks, I'm gonna have to stop for a minute because I've lost my voice.
This is the worst thing
I've ever witnessed.
How I got into this predicament,
I'll never know.
Absolutely incredible.
To be executed for a crime
I never committed.
Of course, isn't all mankind in the same boat?
Isn't all mankind ultimately executed for a crime it never committed?
The difference is that all men go eventually, but I go at 6:00 tomorrow morning.
I was supposed to go at 5:00, but I have a smart lawyer. Got leniency.
I have a tremendous yearning to be young again.
A boy.
Such happy memories at our summer house.
Uncle Nikolai with his wonderful laugh.
God, he was repulsive!
Then there was Grandpa and Grandma, who'd been married for 50 years
and still felt as deeply about one another as the day they met.
And my own father, a handsome and generous man.
In addition to our summer and winter estate,
he owned a valuable piece of land.
True, it was a small piece, but he carried it with him wherever he went.
Dimitri Petrovitch!
I would like to buy your land.
This land is not for sale.
Someday I hope to build on it.
He was an idiot, but I loved him.
Then there was Mother, who made the most delicious blintzes in the world.
Of course, there was Old Gregor and his son, Young Gregor.
Oddly enough, Young Gregor's son was older than Old Gregor.
Nobody could figure out how that happened.
My two brothers, Ivan and Mikhail, used to play amusing little games
but I had a completely different concept of myself as a child.
My first experience with death was with one of our serfs, Old Nehamkin.
Old Nehamkin was on the roof putting up a lightning rod when a storm broke out.
After he failed to show up for dinner,
Mother went to look for him.
What is it, Old Nehamkin?
You're not looking well. Are you okay?
You feel all right?
We laid Old Nehamkin to rest.
And that night,
I had a strange and vivid dream.
I knew that after that dream,
I would not grow up to be an ordinary man.
I had many conversations with Father Nikolai,
who was always dressed in black with a black beard.
For years,
I thought he was an Italian widow.
Every action has a cause. The universe exists, therefore it has a cause.
It follows God created the universe, therefore He exists.
And yet, Spinoza didn't believe in the Holy Trinity.
- Spinoza was a Jew.
- What's a Jew?
You never saw a Jew?
Here, I have some sketches.
- There are Jews.
- No kidding!
They all have these horns?
No. This is the Russian Jew.
The German Jew has these stripes.
I recall my first mystical vision.
I was walking through the woods, thinking about Christ.
If He was a carpenter, I wonder what He'd charge for bookshelves?
Suddenly...
- Who are you?
- Death.
What happens after we die?
Is there a hell?
Is there a God? Do we live again?
All right, let me ask one key question.
Are there girls?
You're an interesting young man.
We'll meet again.
- Don't bother.
- It's no bother.
I grew to full manhood, actually 5'6",
which is technically not full manhood in Russia,
but you can still own property.
Over 5'3", you can own land.
Under 5'3", you need special permission from the Czar.
We were three healthy men.
My brother, Ivan,
my brother, Mikhail,
and myself.
Finally, there was my cousin, Sonja.
In addition to being the most beautiful woman I had ever seen,
she was one of the few people
I could have deep conversations with.
Boris, look at this leaf.
Isn't it perfect?
And this one. Look.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, I definitely think that this is the best of all possible worlds.
Certainly the most expensive.
Isn't nature incredible?
To me, nature is...
You know, I don't know.
Spiders and bugs and then big fish eating little fish and then plants eating... plants and animals eating...
It's like an enormous restaurant.
That's the way I see it.
Yes, but if God created it, it has to be beautiful.
Even if His plan's not apparent to us at the moment.
Sonja, what if there is no God?
Boris Dimitrovitch, are you joking?
What if we're just a bunch of absurd people who are running around with no rhyme or reason?
But if there is no God, then life has no meaning.
Why go on living?
Why not just commit suicide?
Well, let's not get hysterical.
I could be wrong.
I'd hate to blow my brains out and then read in the papers they found something.
Boris, let me show you how absurd your position is.
All right.
Let's say that there is no God, and each man is free to do exactly as he chooses.
Well, what prevents you from murdering somebody?
- Murder's immoral!
- Morality is subjective.
Yes, but subjectivity is objective.
Not in any rational scheme of perception.
Perception is irrational.
It implies imminence.
But judgment of any system or a priori relation of phenomena exists in any rational or metaphysical or at least epistemological contradiction to an abstracted empirical concept such as being or to be or to occur in the thing itself or of the thing itself.
Yeah, I've said that many times.
Boris, we must believe in God.
If I could just see a miracle.
Just... Just one miracle.
If I could see a burning bush or the seas part or my Uncle Sasha pick up a check.
We should go back downstairs.
By now, the last golden streaks of the sunset are vanishing behind the western hills.
Soon the dark blanket of night shall settle over us all.
Hey, you've been going to finishing school!
Hey, you... dating any Russians
I should know about?
Well, Minskov has proposed.
And he's very sweet and wealthy but the age difference is too great.
- I'm 28 and he's 81.
- Oh, that is big.
When I'm 50, he'll be... 103.
That's a bad age for men.
They slow up a lot.
Oh, and Voskovec has made his intentions clear but he deals in herring, and he always smells of herring.
Do you know, he even bought me herring-scented cologne?
Oh, really? That's probably why the cat follows you around.
Love is everything, Boris.
I want to meet some man and scale the heights of passion.
Some man who embodies the three great aspects of love.
Intellectual, spiritual and sensual.
Well, then, there's not too many of us around, but it can be done.
- So many women settle cheaply.
- I know. Poor things.
- They marry for money.
- Money! Well, money.
But I tell you, I feel as though my life would be wasted if I didn't love deeply with a man whose mind I respected, whose spirituality equaled mine and who had the same, oh, lustful appetite for sensual passion that drives me insane.
You're an incredibly complex woman.
I guess you could say
I'm half-saint, half-whore.
Here's hoping I get the half that eats.
- Boris?
- Yes?
- I have a confession to make.
- Yes?
- Ever since you and I were little children...
- Yes?
I've been in love with your brother, Ivan!
Oh, it's only nat...
Ivan? You're kidding!
He can barely write his name in the ground with a stick.
- He has true animal magnetism.
- Animal magnetism?
All that talk about some perfect love, and you're hot for Ivan?
- He kissed me.
- Any place I should know?
It warmed the cockles of my heart.
That's just great.
Nothing like hot cockles!
I think he's going to ask me to marry him.
But he's a gambler and a drinker.
He's got a Neanderthal mentality.
Don't get me wrong, I love him like a brother. Just not one of mine.
Do you hear that commotion?
What is going on downstairs?
Have you heard the news?
Napoleon has invaded Austria.
Why? Is he out of Courvoisier?
At last, a chance to taste the glories of battle!
Well, check with me when it's over.
I'll be in the game room.
No, Boris. You're going to fight.
I'm gonna fight? You're gonna have your head examined.
We leave the day after tomorrow.
Fellas, I'm a pacifist.
I don't believe in war.
He doesn't believe in war?
Napoleon, he believes in war!
What are you going to do when the French soldiers rape your sister?
- I don't have a sister.
- That's no answer.
Who are they gonna rape?
Ivan? They'll throw up.
Don't disgrace me in front of my friends.
What good is war?
We kill a few Frenchmen, they kill a few Russians.
Next thing you know, it's Easter.
Boris, you can't be serious.
You're talking about Mother Russia.
Oh, she's not my mother.
My mother's standing right here, and she's not gonna let her youngest baby get shrapnel in his gums.
Get away from me!
I can't believe what I'm seeing!
Our brother has a yellow streak down his back.
No, it's not down, it runs across.
- Boris, you're a coward!
- Yes, but I'm a militant coward.
Boris, medals! We get medals!
Take it easy, will you, Ivan?
You gotta cut down on your raw meat.
He'll go and he'll fight!
And I hope they will put him in the front lines.
Thanks a lot, Mom. My mother, folks.
This is crazy. I can't shoot a gun.
I was meant to write poetry.
Sonja, I'm not the army type.
I slept with a light on in my room till I was 30.
I can't shower with other men.
Friends! My friends!
On the eve of this glorious occasion,
I have an announcement to make.
Because we go into battle, perhaps never to see our loved ones again,
I wish to announce that tomorrow I intend to marry.
I'm going to take as my bride, a woman I have grown up with.
Anna Ivanova.
- Ivan...
- I'm sorry. I should have told you.
I also have an announcement to make!
Tomorrow, I too, get married.
Wonderful!
Yes, I have been proposed to and have accepted the hand of
Serge Ivanonich Minskov!
Oh!
Yes. I mean... Leonid Voskovec, the herring merchant.
You! Get out here!
You're the worst soldier I ever seen!
- You ignoramus!
- Ignoramus, sir.
- Do you want a dishonorable discharge?
- Yes, sir! Either that or a furlough.
- Goddamn you! You love Russia, don't you?
- Yes, sir.
- Louder!
- Yes, sir.
- You like it here, don't you?
- Yes, sir.
You want to make a career out of the army, don't you?
Well, let's not get carried away.
From now on, you'll clean the mess hall and the latrine!
Yes, sir.
How will I tell the difference?
Okay. One, two. One, two. One, two...
Yeah, three is next, if you're having any trouble.
Naturally, the war affects the herring industry.
The ports are blockaded and fresh shipments of the herring become more difficult to obtain.
Of course, when something hurts herring, it hurts me.
You see, what people don't understand is that there are hundreds of types of herring, each with its own interesting history.
Sonja, are you okay?
Oh, yes.
But I've talked long enough.
Why don't you two play?
As I have got some important business to attend to.
A capital idea!
Ready? And a one and a two and...
You stopped.
What would you think if I told you you were one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen?
I'd think, "What a mad fool he is."
And what would you say if I suddenly put my arms around you?
I'd think,
"What a mad, impetuous fool he is."
And what would you think if I kissed you?
I'd think, "What a mad, impetuous, wonderful fool he is."
- Don't.
- I must!
- We just ate.
- Your skin, it is so beautiful.
Yes, I know. It covers my whole body.
I must have you.
No, no. Not here. Not on the piano.
It's a rented piano.
Darling, my darling, my...
Sonja.
Sonja, did you see a jar of wine sauce?
- Come to my quarters tomorrow at 3:00.
- I can't.
- Please!
- It's immoral. What time?
So who is to say what is moral?
Morality is subjective.
Subjectivity is objective.
Moral notions imply attributes to substances which exist only in relational duality.
Not as an essential extension of ontological existence.
Can we not talk about sex so much?
I am terribly sorry!
- You'd better go.
- Sonja, please.
- No, no, I mean it, Pierre.
- Sonja darling, please...
Men, next week we leave for the front.
The object will be to kill as many Frenchmen as possible.
Naturally, they are going to try and kill as many Russians as possible.
If we kill more Frenchmen, we win.
If they kill more Russians, they win.
What'll we win?
What do we win, Private?
Imagine your loved ones conquered by Napoleon and forced to live under French rule.
Do you want them to eat that rich food and those heavy sauces?
No.
Do you want them to have souffle every meal, and croissant?
No.
Now, men, because you are all getting a three-day furlough before going into battle, we would like to show you this little hygiene play.
- Goodbye. I hope you had a good time.
- I did. I had a good time.
Oh, what's this sore on my lip?
I better see the doctor.
Doc, I have this sore on my lip.
- You have a social disease, my friend.
- Oh, my God!
If you do not treat it, you will go blind or insane!
Well, men, that is the end of the play.
Have a good time on your furlough, but look after yourselves.
Well, what did you think of the play?
Oh, it was weak. I was never interested.
Although the part of the doctor was played with gusto and verve, and the girl had a delightful cameo role.
A puckish satire of contemporary mores, a droll spoof aimed more at the heart than the head.
As for me, I'm planning to spend the next three days in a brothel.
- Care to come with me?
- No, no.
I went to a brothel once in my life.
I got hiccups.
You know, it was over like that.
Besides, there's someone in St. Petersburg I'd like to visit.
Well, have fun.
I think you'll find The Magic Flute is Mozart's greatest opera.
Oh, yeah, it's a hell of an opera, isn't it?
They sell popcorn or gumdrops or something?
We're so delighted you decided to spend your furlough with us.
You know, you've always been our favorite nephew, even though you're an incredible coward.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Any news of Cousin Sonja?
Only that she and Voskovec are unhappy and that she takes lovers.
- She takes uppers?
- Lovers!
Oh, lovers! Lovers.
Hey, who is that?
That's the Countess Alexandrovna, one of the most enticing woman in St. Petersburg.
Ample bosoms, yes?
I'd say ample for a regiment.
She's recently widowed.
And they say her husband, the Count, died in her arms trying to satisfy her prodigious sexual desires.
No kidding! Died smiling, I bet.
Who's the character with her with the wry moustache?
That's Anton Ivanovich Inbedkov, her current lover.
Although the way she keeps staring at you!
I'm sure I could work something out with him.
I'd let him warm her up for a few minutes and I could come in at the end and finish her.
You must be careful of Anton Ivanovich.
- He has a furious temper.
- Really?
He has killed several men in duels.
All in a jealous rage over the Countess.
Glad you mentioned it.
Think I'll watch the opera.
Oh, there is something about Mozart!
I think you're probably responding to his music.
Oh, my goodness, be careful!
Couldn't you be careful?
I believe... I believe...
I believe that the lobby...
I believe that the lobby of the St. Petersburg Opera House is one of the most beautiful in Europe.
Who is this attractive and mysterious soldier?
Boris Grushenko.
Ooh, I'm sorry. I goosed that lady.
He has quite a sensitive face, hasn't he?
That's just the part of me that shows.
Grushenko.
Isn't he the young coward all St. Petersburg is talking about?
I'm not so young. I'm 35.
The one who's so afraid for his own safety that he is reluctant to defend his country.
He is in a bad mood, isn't he?
What's the matter?
Don't you like your seats?
You must visit me for tea someday.
I'm sure we'd have a lot to talk about.
It's okay with me.
I'll bring the tea bags.
We could run a quick check on your erogenous zones.
What about the dybbuk?
Why do you persist in taunting me in public?
If you so much as come near the Countess,
I'll see that you'll never see the light of day again.
If a man said that to me,
I'd break his neck!
I am a man!
Well, I mean a much shorter man.
Boris!
- Boris Dimitrovitch!
- Sonja!
Look at you.
You look so handsome in your uniform.
Well, I got a perfect build for clothes.
I'm a 28 dwarf.
And you, Sonja, my God, you look more beautiful standing here than you do in person.
- Oh, Boris, I'm so unhappy.
- Oh, I wish you weren't.
Voskovec and I quarrel frequently.
I've become a scandal.
Poor Sonja!
For the past weeks,
I've visited Seretsky in his room.
Why? What's in his room?
Oh.
And before Seretsky, Alexi.
And before Alexi, Alegorian.
- And before Alegorian, Asimov...
- Okay!
Wait! I'm still on the A's.
- How many lovers do you have?
- In the midtown area?
Oh, Sonja.
Boris, my life is ruined. Over.
I can't stand Voskovec!
He's a man whose mentality has reduced all the beauty of the world to a small pickled fish!
Sonja, what you need is somebody to take you away from Voskovec.
Somebody who loves you, somebody who's always loved you and who's always cared for you very deeply.
How is your brother, Ivan?
Oh, Ivan's all right.
- Yes? Ivan is well?
- You know Ivan is a tiger.
He went through basic training in two weeks. They made him a major.
- And does he ever speak of me?
- Sonja, he's busy.
Well, he must! He must speak of me sometimes. He must!
Take it easy, will ya?
This is army property.
Once he was sick. He was delirious.
He called your name out.
Really? Then there's hope.
Look, tomorrow my regiment pulls out.
We're going to the front.
We're badly outnumbered by the French.
There's very little chance that any of us will ever come back.
Exactly what did he say about me?
Sonja!
Oh, now where did you say you were going?
Oh, yes! Oh, yes, the war.
Well... dress warmly, Boris, and have a nice time.
The idea is not to panic and run.
Then they shoot you in the back.
I don't want to be trampled by a horse.
What about you, Boris?
Yeah, I want to be trampled by a horse.
I don't even want to fight.
Think there's any difference whether we live under the Czar or Napoleon?
They're both crooks.
The Czar's a little taller.
Boris, if you don't like Napoleon and you don't like the Czar, who do you think should be running the country?
- You really want to know? The serfs.
- Oh, the serfs?
That's right. They're the only ones who know how to do anything.
If a fence needs putting up, or a picture needs hanging, it's always the serfs.
He wants the serfs to run the country!
Why not the criminal element, or the Jews?
Some Jews are smart!
Although I hear their women don't believe in sex after marriage.
- Are you married, Boris?
- Me? No.
- You got a sweetheart?
- No, no.
I'm in love with a girl.
She's married to someone.
And she's in love with someone, and he's married.
It's a real healthy situation.
- Hey, look, Boris. Look, look.
- What do you got there?
I got a lock of my wife's hair. Look.
A lock of her hair? She...
She's probably running around bald!
Don't drop it. Don't drop it.
You got a lock of your sweetheart's hair?
No. My sweetheart's married.
I got a lock of her husband's hair.
It's the best I could do.
Boy, this... This army cooking will get you every time.
There's Visinksy!
He was from my village.
He was the village idiot.
Yeah. What did you do, place?
Oh, God is testing us.
If he's gonna test us, why doesn't he give us a written?
Wow! The battle looks completely different when you're in the middle of it than it does to the generals up on the hill.
Hey, get your red hots.
Yeah. You got anything to drink?
Oh, no, the guy with the beer will be around in a second.
Hey, fella, you got something smaller?
I just started.
We started the battle with 12,000 men.
When it was over, we had 14 survivors.
We got a message from the Czar saying,
"Keep up the good work."
That night as I was burying bodies,
I had another mystical experience.
Mercifully, God was on our side.
Yeah. I'm sure things could have gotten a lot worse if He wasn't.
It might've rained.
Grushenko.
Vladimir Maximovitch, you're alive!
No, I'm dead. Look at this hole.
- Oh... Does it hurt?
- I feel nothing.
You don't look so bad for a guy who's dead.
Actually better than when you were alive.
I think it agrees with you.
- Do me a favor.
- Sure, anything.
This engagement ring.
I was gonna give it to my girlfriend.
A surprise.
- Oh, you want me to give it to her?
- No! What's the point?
- Take it back to the jeweler's in Smolensk.
- Right.
- Petroshkin. Vladimir Petroshkin.
- Okay.
Tell him I'm dead, and get the deposit back.
Oh, okay, sure.
What'd you give him for this?
Sixteen hundred roubles.
For this, you gave him 1,600 roubles?
- Look, this is a diamond.
- I know.
- Two little baguettes.
- This is insane.
- I could have gotten you this ring for 1200.
- Not this.
- Never... Never that ring.
- Same ring. The exact same ring.
Never. Listen.
Anyway, listen, take the deposit,
- go to Kiev.
- Right.
Give it to a woman named Natasha Petrovna.
- Right. Okay.
- Get a receipt. Make sure you get a receipt.
Why do you need a receipt? You're dead.
- Tax purposes.
- Oh, good thinking.
- What happened?
- He was cleaning his pistol and it went off.
- The bullet is lodged in his heart.
- Is it serious?
With proper medical care, he could last another 10 minutes.
Why? Why were you cleaning your pistol?
I was going to fight a duel to defend your honor.
A Turkish cavalry officer cast aspersions on it.
He said you were sleeping around.
I knew he was lying.
That you were pure.
Oi.
Yes, well, Leonid,
I know I could have been a better wife to you.
Kinder.
I could have made love with you more often, or once even.
Once would have been nice.
You were a kind and loving husband.
Generous, and always considerate.
What's he got? About eight minutes?
I think I'm slow. He's got about three.
Swimming out to the open sea, like the great, wild herring!
I realize this must be a great blow to you, Sonja.
But you must not allow yourself to be consumed with grief.
The dead pass on.
And life is for the living!
I guess you're right.
Where do you want to eat?
Let's go to Rykoff's.
- No, no. Not Rykoff's.
- Why?
I feel like meat. What do you get at Rykoff's, maybe a cheese sandwich?
- If it's not meat, it's nothing.
- It's not good for your health.
There's a tavern at the edge of the square makes a sausage that's wonderful.
Meanwhile, the war continued.
My regiment had been wiped out.
And I found myself lost behind enemy lines.
I panicked and hid where I could.
Then I fainted.
When I came to, I realized
I had made a terrible mistake.
As fate would have it,
I landed on a group of French generals,
causing their immediate surrender, and making me a hero.
My brother Ivan was not so lucky.
He was a fatality of war,
he had been bayonetted to death by a Polish conscientious objector.
You're praying for Ivan?
Yes. Your husband.
I loved him, as you know.
I wanted you to have some of his possessions.
How kind.
I kept his sword and gold watch.
But here.
I'm giving you his moustache.
I'll cherish it.
Also, some string.
Ivan saved string.
I know. It was one of the reasons why I loved him.
I understand that.
I loved him for his string, too.
Anything else for me?
I thought we should divide his letters.
Do you want the vowels or the consonants?
His vowels.
You keep the consonants.
Life is unbearable.
- So we meet again.
- Countess Alexandrovna.
I wish there was some way
I could show you my gratitude for what you've done for Russia.
I may be able to think of something.
Maybe we could meet in my room later this evening.
As you wish. How's five minutes?
Well, what have we here?
Oh, still dating laughing boy?
Back from the war, I see.
Yes. I'd have stayed longer, but they ran out of medals.
I understand your heroism was quite inadvertent.
You should have such an inadvertent heroism. That's telling him.
Are you gonna waste your time conversing with this strutting ass?
Careful. I think it's a trick question.
Fetch my carriage, Anton Inbedkov.
I'll join you momentarily.
Nice seeing you again, Quasimodo.
My room at midnight?
- Perfect. Will you be there, too?
- Naturally.
- Until midnight, then.
- Midnight.
Make it a quarter to 12:00.
- Midnight.
- Midnight. Of course.
Boris, you hardly touched your blini.
Oh, yes, well, I've been sick, you know.
Come in.
How do you like it?
It's all right.
I prefer something sexy, but you...
Would you like some wine?
Something to put you in the mood?
Oh, I've been in the mood since the late 1700s.
You're disgusting, but I love you.
Well, my disgustingness is my best feature.
It must be lonely at the front.
How long has it been since you've made love to a woman?
What's today? Monday, Tuesday...
Yeah, two years.
Two years. You remember how, of course.
Well, if you start me, it'll all come back.
Remember that?
Yes. That was just like kissing, right?
You're the greatest lover I've ever had.
Well, I practice a lot when I'm alone.
Shall we say pistols at dawn?
Well, we can say it.
I don't know what it means, but we can say it.
You have insulted the honor of Countess Alexandrovna.
Why? I let her finish first.
- Her seconds will call on you.
- Seconds? I never gave her seconds.
As her fiance, my seconds will call on your seconds.
Well, my seconds will be out.
Have them call on my thirds.
If my thirds are out, go directly to my fourths.
Boris, he's serious.
You must meet him on the field of honor.
I'm not gonna duel with him.
He's a marksman and a killer!
- Your honor is at stake!
- Hey, what is this? "Slap Boris Day?"
You are a war hero.
Surely a duel with Anton Inbedkov is nothing to fear.
Look, I just don't want to waste a good bullet, that's all.
The kid's rash.
He doesn't know what he's saying.
I'll drop by his house later, give him a chance to apologize.
If he doesn't, I'll move to Finland.
- Guess who?
- Oh.
Oh, I'd know those hands anywhere!
It's Old Nehamkin!
- No! It's...
- Boris!
- Yes. How are you? I brought you a present.
- Oh.
What? Oh, what?
You know those earrings you always wanted?
The long ones?
Thank you, Cousin Boris.
Twice removed.
By tomorrow morning,
I may be removed completely.
What is it? You look so worried.
Sonja, are you scared of dying?
"Scared" is the wrong word.
I'm frightened of it.
Interesting distinction.
If only God would give me some sign!
If He would just speak to me once!
Anything. One sentence. Two words.
If He would just cough.
Of course there's a God!
We're made in His image.
You think I was made in God's image?
Take a look at me.
You think He wears glasses?
Not with those frames.
Nothingness.
Nonexistence.
Black emptiness.
What'd you say?
I was just planning my future.
Why are you so preoccupied with death?
Sit down with me for a second.
Sonja, tomorrow morning I'm gonna fight a duel with Anton Inbedkov.
He's much better than I am at it, and I'll probably be killed.
I wanted to take this time, if I don't see you again,
- to say that I love you.
- Boris...
I've always loved you ever since we were kids.
I was heartbroken when you loved Ivan, but I still love you.
Why didn't you say something?
- Would it have mattered?
- Oh, of course not, darling.
If by some miracle I'm not killed tomorrow, would you marry me?
What do you think the odds are?
Going to die before the harvest!
The crops, the grains, fields of rippling wheat.
Wheat. All there is in life is wheat!
Sonja, here's your chance to do something kind for a dying boy.
But I don't really love Boris. I mean,
I love him, but I'm not in love with him.
Oh, wheat, lots of wheat.
Fields of wheat!
A tremendous amount of wheat!
And yet he loves me, and would make a devoted husband.
Not too exciting, but devoted.
We'd have a family. Maybe not our own. We could rent one.
I could learn to love him.
Me, Boris and six rented children.
Or would I feel trapped?
Suffocated? Can't breathe!
Open a window. No, no, no. Not that one.
The one in the bathroom.
Yellow wheat, red wheat, wheat with feathers, Cream of Wheat!
Poor boy, dueling with Anton Inbedkov!
By this time tomorrow morning, my beloved Cousin Boris will look like a Swiss cheese.
Promise him anything.
Make him happy for a night.
Oh! Or would I feel trapped?
Suffocated? My youth gone!
Living with a Swiss cheese and rented children.
Of course, I'll marry you, Boris.
It would be an honor for me.
This Anton Inbedkov, he is a good shot, isn't he?
- I'm afraid so.
- Well...
Since this may be your last night on Earth, let's go back to my room and make love.
Oh, nice idea.
I'll bring the soy sauce.
At last! You're late, Boris Grushenko.
We thought you weren't coming.
- Well, I overslept.
- Can you be so relaxed and confident?
You know, I hate to shoot anybody before I've had my morning tea.
I get a lot of bad mail from the serfs.
I implore both of you, come back to your senses.
There is still time to call it off, by mutual consent, with no loss of honor.
Since you put it that way, maybe I will hop back into bed.
We'll do it now.
And to the death.
Oh, no, I can't do anything to the death.
Doctor's orders.
I have an ulcer condition, and dying is one of the worst things for it.
Begin!
You have been challenged. Choose.
Oh.
Sure.
Oh.
All right. I'll take these.
Just one.
Oh, he gets one! That was silly.
Starting back-to-back, on my signal, you will walk 10 paces, turn and fire.
- Is that clear?
- Of course.
Of course.
Good luck. And God be with you both.
You listening?
One, two.
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10!
Does this come out from dry cleaning or is this like gravy?
You must shoot.
No, no, no. I don't wanna shoot.
You must! It's the law.
Well, if it's the law, then I'll shoot in the air.
There! I fulfilled my obligation.
Boris Dimitrovitch,
I've learned a great lesson here today.
Yes, me too.
Never shoot up in the air when you're standing under it.
You could have killed me, and you didn't!
How can I ever repay you?
Well, you can start by getting off my toe.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Boris Dimitrovitch, from this day on,
I will lead a new life.
I will modify my views.
I will preach goodness.
Perhaps join the church.
I will lead a righteous life.
Devote myself, as I did in my childhood, to my singing.
He's got a great voice, hasn't he?
I should've shot him.
So, Sonja and I married.
I know pronounce you man and wife.
Oh!
I'm so happy!
Look at the kid, she's so happy, she's speechless.
He missed.
He missed it. He missed.
I know what's bothering you.
You're worried whether you're gonna be a stimulating enough wife for me.
Whether it's possible to live up to the chores and obligations of married life.
But it's gonna be a cinch. I promise.
I have no bad habits at all.
Granted, I have a few eccentricities.
I won't eat any food that begins with the letter "F," like chicken for instance.
Boris, I just don't love you.
Oh, Sonja...
Oh, I mean I love you, but I'm not in love with you.
Sonja, do you even know what love means?
There are many different kinds of love, Boris.
There's love between a man and a woman, love between a mother and a son.
Two women. Let's not forget my favorite.
But then there's the love
I've always dreamed of
- ever since I was a little girl.
- Yeah.
The love between two extraordinary individuals.
Sonja.
Oh, don't, Boris. Please!
Sex without love is an empty experience.
Yes, but, as empty experiences go, it's one of the best.
At first, things were a little tense between us.
But after a while, she relaxed.
Don't. Not here.
Soon Sonja got more used to me.
Sometimes she actually had fun.
Like the time she baked her first soufflé.
Money was scarce,
and Sonja learned to make wonderful dishes out of snow.
Sweetheart, it looks a little rare to me.
Oh, I left it in the oven for an hour-and-a-half.
Did you? 'Cause it looks, you know, it's all... What's for dessert?
- A surprise, Boris.
- Yes, what?
A nice, big bowl of sleet!
Oh, sleet, my favorite!
That's wonderful.
Evenings we played music together.
And as time passed, I won her heart.
Oh, Boris, I've never been so happy in my entire life!
I love you, Boris, in a deeper way than I ever thought was possible.
Really?
I want to have children with you.
- What kind?
- Little children.
Of course!
The big ones are mentally slower.
- I want to have three children.
- One of each.
Oh, Boris... Boris, I'm actually happy.
Well, I hate to say I told you so, but some men have it, and some men don't.
Fortunately, I have so much of it.
Those next months were the happiest time of my life.
Then one day, at the height of my sense of well-being,
I suddenly and for no apparent reason
was seized with an urge to commit suicide.
No. You're healthy.
You have a beautiful wife.
Your work is going well.
- I know, but something's missing.
- What?
I don't know. I feel a void at the center of my being.
What kind of void?
- Well, an empty void.
- Empty void?
Yes. I felt a full void about a month ago, but it was just something I ate.
Maybe what you have is a sickness of the soul.
- Look! There's Death!
- What? Who?
Death! He's got Krapotkin, the wine merchant.
- Really?
- Yeah, and a woman.
Ooh, it's not Mrs. Krapotkin!
- You're kidding?
- No.
I always knew Krapotkin was diddling somebody else.
Where are you taking Krapotkin?
Away. Forever.
Listen, if you run into my wife, tell her I'm with you.
Goodbye, Krapotkin.
If you get a chance, write.
Father Andre, holiest of holies, aged and wise, you are the most wrinkled man in the entire country.
Get off my beard, you little jerk!
Oh.
Rise, my child.
- Rise!
- I'm standing.
My eyesight is poor.
Everyone says you're senile with age but you're the only one that can help me.
I don't think you're senile.
- Where did you say the fish was caught?
- What fish?
Didn't you say something about fish?
Father, Boris is trying to commit suicide!
Last week he contemplated killing himself by inhaling next to an Armenian.
Tell Boris this.
I have lived many years.
And after many trials and tribulations,
I have come to the conclusion that the best thing is...
Yes?
- Blonde, 12-year-old girls!
- Father...
Two of them, whenever possible.
Father, I counted on you!
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Yes, thank you, thank you,
Your Grubbiness.
As I dangled at the rope's end,
I was suddenly seized with an urge to live.
All I could think of was Sonja.
I wanted to hold her close to me, weep tears on her shoulder
and engage in oral sex.
It was then that I made the decision to live.
To live and become a great poet.
I should have been a pair of ragged claws scuttling across the floors of silent seas.
Too sentimental!
That winter, Sonja and I had a wonderful time.
We found a new friend,
Berdykov, the village idiot.
Berdykov would sit smiling for days, and stroke a little piece of velvet
while Sonja would make him happy by feeding him cookies.
We looked forward to the spring when we could have a child of our own.
Little did we know.
War! Napoleon has invaded Russia!
It's war! War!
Oh, what about all our plans?
We were gonna be parents this year.
Well, there's gonna be a slight change in our plans.
Instead of parents, we're gonna be refugees.
Well, that's terrible!
We have to take our possessions and flee.
I'm very good at that.
I was the men's freestyle fleeing champion two years in a row.
Then we have to remember to burn the food so the French don't get it.
Although I know it's tough to light borscht.
- Boris.
- What?
- I have an idea.
- What?
Let's assassinate Napoleon.
Yeah, interesting.
It's getting a little late.
You want to start knitting dinner?
- I'm serious.
- What do you mean you're serious?
I mean, let's you and I kill Napoleon.
Sonja, you been drinking from the glass we use for the village idiot?
It's the answer to all our problems.
No, it's not the answer. It's an answer.
And it's the wrong answer.
The correct answer is "flee."
F-L-E-A. Flee.
No, no, the French occupy Moscow.
- His headquarters are there.
- Sonja...
Two innocent-looking types like us could work our way in to see him, and then shoot him.
Sonja, we'd never get near him.
If we did, we'd shoot and miss.
He's a tough target. He's very small.
Boris, it's our chance to perform a truly heroic act!
Since when is murder a heroic act?
Violence is justified in the service of mankind.
- Who said that?
- Attila the Hun.
You're quoting a Hun to me?
Don't you know that murder carries with it a moral imperative that transcends any notion of the inherent universal free will?
Oh, that is incredibly jejune!
- That's jejune?
- Jejune!
You have the temerity to say that
I'm talking to you out of jejune-osity?
I'm one of the most "june" people in all of the Russias!
I have Ivan's old pistol!
Sonja, political assassination doesn't work.
Violence leads to violence.
He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword.
Well, I'm out of clichés now.
What, are you suggesting passive resistance?
No, I'm suggesting active fleeing.
You can't run away all your life.
I know, but murder!
The most foul of all crimes.
And, not abstract murder, shooting a rifle at an unknown enemy on the battlefield, but standing in a closed room with a live human being and pulling the trigger face-to-face and a famous human being, a successful one, one who earns more than I do.
My God, you figure Napoleon, why he's gotta be good for
10,000 francs a week, that's minimum!
That's minimum.
That's without tips or extras.
Nothing like that.
And me, what am I?
He's a great man.
He thinks like the super man, and I'm just a worm, an insect.
Some kind of crawling, disgusting, creeping little vermin.
- You know you can stop me.
- I will when I disagree.
Oh, Sonja, who are we to kill somebody?
Boris, for the first time in my life,
I feel free! Weightless!
I have an exhilarating feeling of human freedom!
It's called the guillotine.
Oh, look, Boris.
Look, the soft golden dusk is already transmogrifying itself into the blue star-sprinkled night.
Careful, 'cause that gun may be loaded.
Several days later, we set out for Moscow.
We took Berdykov with us part way.
He was on his way to Minsk.
There was a village idiots' convention in Minsk,
and Berdykov was planning to attend.
Village idiots from all over Russia were meeting there.
We drove through small villages and tiny hamlets.
We had no great plan,
but when we stopped at an inn along the way, fate provided one.
Pardon me, could you tell me who those people are behind that screen?
That's Don Francisco of Spain and his sister.
They're en route to meet Napoleon.
Don Francisco, I presume.
Do you know me, señor?
Oh, let's just say your name is legend in these parts.
It is?
Well, perhaps not legend, but it never fails to get a big laugh.
And you must be the Don's sister, the noted Spanish countess and meeskeit.
Who are you?
Just a humble servant who wishes to buy His Excellency a drink.
Oh, I would be honored.
Waiter, a bottle of your best red wine, please, and two straws.
Two straws!
Word has it the Don is en route to visit Napoleon.
Word travels fast.
Not as fast as good news.
No news is good news.
Here today, gone tomorrow.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.
Your turn.
We would invite you to join us but the difference in social rank and wealth, it makes it silly.
Oh, yes, I threw this on.
It's a knockdown.
You guys know Napoleon or what?
Hardly.
A joke, Your Nothingness?
We are friends with his brother, who is arranging the affairs of Spain, but this is our first meeting with the great Emperor.
That's all I wanted to know.
- Don Francisco?
- Pardon me?
I'm having trouble adjusting my belt.
You think you could come over here and hold my... bosom for a while?
Of course, señorita.
No, no, no. It's not what I had in mind!
It should have more cream between the crust, and no raisins!
- But at our last meeting, you said raisins.
- No!
If this pastry is to bear my name, it must be richer.
More cream.
- Is there time?
- Very little.
My spies tell me that my illustrious British enemy is working on a new meat recipe which he plans to call Beef Wellington.
It will never get off the ground.
We must develop the Napoleon before he develops Beef Wellington.
The future of Europe hangs in the balance.
Yes, Your Highness.
We must see you, Your Highness.
We have reason to believe that there is a plot to take your life.
That's why we've made up an obscure private from the ranks to look like you.
- Look.
- How do you do, Your Highness?
He looks like me?
You're seeing him without his rug.
Come.
Just let me get this on, Your Highness.
And now, I take your place.
I will teach you to walk like me.
I have a great walk.
With the Emperor out of the way, all that remains is to kill Don Francisco.
That will destroy His Highness's stupid dreams of a treaty with Spain.
Then I'll sail to Austria and form an alliance with the crown.
Not the king, just the crown.
They call me mad, but one day when the history of France is written, they will mark my name well.
Sidney Applebaum!
We're here to see the Emperor.
Who is calling?
- Who? Oh, that's droll!
- Droll, yes.
Apparently, he's not familiar with the list of the 100 most important "Spanishers."
Yes! It is only Don Francisco and his sister.
Yes, the "Donessa."
Yes. We have an appointment with Napoleon.
Right. Napoleon Bonaparte, the noted international tyrant.
- You? You are Don Francisco and his sister?
- Oh, for sure.
- Well, we've had a long, a hot journey.
- A hot journey.
And our throats are parched.
They're parched.
Our throats, they're parched.
- Parched! We seek succor. Succor! Succor!
- Yes. Succor! Succor!
Yes, is succor here by any chance?
I never knew your name, madam.
Oh... the boys usually just call me Juanita.
Juanita.
Juanita.
Juanita. The Emperor is a man who appreciates magnificent women.
He'll be much taken with you.
Good! I wore my flats.
We are of course all most anxious to hear your proposal for a treaty.
Oh, good.
Yes, I've given it a lot of thought and I've come up with all the little details, you know.
Now if I can just think of the main points, we got something.
Well, there is no time for business.
You've had a wearing journey.
Yes, well, we should say hello to the Emperor.
That's right.
Shorts gets touchy if we bypass him.
There will be time for that later.
First, you'll be shown your quarters and wined and dined in a manner befitting Spanish nobility.
Oh, wonderful!
But go easy on the champagne.
The Donessa has gout.
Well, if you'll proceed, your needs will be attended to.
Oh, thank you.
While you're here with your sister, should you desire a little blonde French love dream to be sent to your room, it will be arranged.
Good, good. Maybe I'll have two to keep the symmetry perfect.
I prefer two myself!
I prefer three, but it's hard enough to get one.
This room big enough for you?
Or would you prefer a suite?
Boris... Boris, I'm scared.
You're scared?
I'm growing a beak and feathers.
- What are we gonna do?
- I say we get out of here now!
I'm not leaving here until we shoot Napoleon. Here.
Oh, I see. Thanks! I'm the hitman.
Remember. You can't take any chances.
Now make sure the barrel of the gun is pressed against his head or his chest.
And don't pull the trigger, Boris.
Squeeze it.
Hey, where did you go to finishing school?
On a pirate ship?
Let's just make sure our plans are straight.
Okay, here's one.
You flirt with him, bring him back here after dinner, lull him into a state of satisfaction, and I'll shoot him.
"I'll shoot him."
Can you believe I'm talking like this?
Yes! Yes, Spain is quite warm this time of year.
Barcelona is warmer than Madrid, but then, the people are so different, the Barcelonians and the Madridniks.
Are all the ladies in Spain, as beautiful as you are, madam?
Oh, well, not all.
You've gotta have some beasts.
Oh, General! Do excuse me, madam.
Oh, yes, yes.
Take it easy, will you?
You're making a fool of yourself.
- Hey, this is good champagne.
- Yeah?
Have you had enough, or are you gonna drink another case?
I'll be fine.
All I need is a few solids.
A few solids?
You should drink a blotter!
Oh, I believe I had the pleasure of meeting your sister once.
My sister? Which one?
- I thought you only had one.
- One? One? No.
Oh, no, no. Actually, well,
I have a half-sister.
Well, no, not exactly half.
- It's two-fifths.
- Oh.
Ladies and gentlemen,
His Imperial Highness, the Emperor Napoleon.
So you are Don Francisco!
Yes, I have regards from your brother in Spain.
Says you went away, you don't write, nothing.
Comes a Friday night, he never hears from you.
You took his razor, you never returned it.
- This is an honor for me.
- No, it's a greater honor for me.
- No, a greater honor for me.
- No, it's a greater honor for me.
No, a greater honor for me.
Well, perhaps you are right.
Perhaps it is a greater honor for you.
And you must be Don Francisco's sister.
No, you must be Don Francisco's sister.
No, it's a greater honor for me.
I see our Spanish guests have a sense of humor.
- Yeah, she's a great kidder.
- No, you're a great kidder.
No, you're Don Francisco's sister.
- Shall we dine?
- Oh, can we eat first?
Your sister and His Highness seem to be getting along quite well.
Do you find me attractive as a man?
Yes! I think that's your best bet.
How much of your feelings for me are because I've conquered half of Europe?
Oh, I'd say half my feelings.
It evens out.
I wonder if you should be more difficult to conquer than Russia?
Well, I weigh less.
I'll go to your room after dinner.
Good. I'll go to yours.
Come in.
Sonja... Sonja, I've been thinking about this. It's murder!
What if everybody acted like this?
It'd be a world full of murderers!
You know what that would do to property values?
I know! And if everybody went to the same restaurant on the same evening and ordered blintzes, there'd be chaos, but they don't.
I'm telling her murder, and she's telling me blintzes.
Hey, you said yourself, there is no right or wrong.
- It's what you choose!
- That's right, and I choose danger!
- Oh, really?
- No, but it did sounded great.
Oh, Boris, if only we could be children again.
Yeah, I know.
Preferably French children.
Do you know the only truly happy person
I know is Berdykov, the village idiot?
Well, it's easy to be happy, you know, if your one concern in life is figuring out how much saliva to dribble.
Kiss me!
- Which one do you want?
- Give me a number eight.
Number eight. That's two fours.
Oh, that's an easy one.
Oh, coming!
Coming.
- Are you alone?
- Of course.
- I thought I heard voices.
- I was praying.
- I heard two voices.
- Oh, I do both parts.
- Champagne! From France.
- Oh.
I see you brought the whole kit.
- To your eyes.
- To the bridge of your nose.
My lust knows no bounds.
Shall we, to the bed?
Shall we what to the bed?
Forgive my haste.
We have always heard that Spanish blood is the hottest.
- I had mine cooled for the summer.
- You may set the pace.
Good, good!
Why don't we just sit a while and build slowly?
You don't wanna peak too early.
You'll be back in your room before midnight.
You are a temptress.
Oh, please, Excellency.
- Call me Napoleon.
- Good! You can call me Napoleon, too.
I've never met a woman like you.
I could rest my head on your shoulder like this forever.
Yes, it sounds like it'd be fun except for the grease mark.
His Excellency.
- What's that?
- Oh, just a breeze.
- Breeze?
- A breeze with mice.
Mice! What's the difference?
If I had a woman like you instead of my wife,
I would conquer all of Europe.
- What's that?
- What... Oh, that?
I think that was just the old closet door slamming shut.
One can't be too careful.
The Russian underground would love me dead.
I take a great chance in an occupied territory.
Assassins surround me.
Every day is another encounter with death.
Oh, yes, well, this is the price one pays for political power.
Yes, life at the top is hell.
Which is why I relish every minute with you.
Every second means something to me.
That's why the sooner we...
The sooner we consummate the act of love the happier I will be.
- Oh! Go ahead!
- I can't!
- Don Francisco!
- Shoot!
Put down that pistol. She's over 18.
You're a tyrant and a dictator, and you start wars!
Why is he reciting my credits?
- Kill him!
- Guards!
No!
Boris, we're not here on a vacation!
Well, I can't shoot him.
He's a live human being.
He'll bleed on the carpet.
Give me that gun!
- Oh!
- See? It's not so easy.
- Why? Why can't I do it?
- Because it's morally wrong!
Oh, I see.
Well, can you define your terms?
Yes, there's a moral imperative involved here.
Yeah, where...
Where's the moral imperative?
Don't you see? By killing Napoleon, you're actually killing yourself because we were involved in a kind of total absolute.
Oh, come on, this isn't a total absolute.
You're being pantheistic again.
- How is that pantheistic?
- Come on!
We all relate universally to a giant oneness.
Oh, you wanna hit him? He's coming to again. Just give him a little shot.
Yeah, good. You see, we're dealing with an ethical question here.
Oh, come on, Boris! You're not gonna quote Thomas Aquinas again.
Absolutely, where he said,
"You must never kill a man
"particularly if it means taking his life."
- What's the matter?
- Don't you see?
And if we don't stop him, he'll burn down half of Europe!
Well, maybe we'll get lucky, and he'll do the half with our landlord in it.
- Boris! For our children.
- We don't have children.
- Then for our parents.
- They don't have children, either.
Well, I'm going back and I'm gonna kill him!
- Sonja!
- I am.
No!
All right. Look. Pull the carriage out front. I'll go kill him.
Look at him.
If I don't kill him, he'll make war all through Europe.
But murder.
What would Socrates say?
All those Greeks were homosexuals.
Boy, they must've had some wild parties.
I bet they all took a house together on Crete for the summer.
A, Socrates is a man.
B, all men are mortal.
C, all men are Socrates.
That means all men are homosexuals.
Oh, I'm not a homosexual.
Once, some Cossacks whistled at me.
I happen to have the kind of body that excites both persuasions.
But... you know, some men are heterosexual and some men are bisexual and some men don't think about sex at all, you know. They become lawyers.
My problem is that
I see both sides of every issue.
I'm too logical.
You know, I...
The world is not logical.
If it was logical, how would Old Nehamkin be younger than Young Nehamkin?
I knew there was something crazy about that when I was a kid but every time I said something, they'd smack me, so, you know...
I'm just racked with guilt and I'm consumed with remorse and stricken with suffering for the human race.
Not only that, but I'm developing a herpes on my lip here that is really killing me.
Oh, what to do!
Arrest this man for murder!
Fortunately, he only killed an impostor.
I didn't do anything.
Hey, take it easy, will you?
You're bending my throat.
The Spanish government will hear about this!
Don Francisco is not a man who takes these things lightly.
Oh, there's Don Francisco now.
There's been a mistake. I know. I made it.
By some miracle, Sonja managed to elude the French and escape.
I, with my usual good luck, got thrown in a damp cell to await execution,
my favorite pastime.
Fortunately, it was a French jail, so the food was not bad.
My family was allowed to visit me.
Remember that nice boy next door?
Raskolnikov?
- Yeah.
- He killed two ladies.
No! What a nasty story.
Bobick told it to me.
He heard it from one of the Karamazov brothers.
Oh, he must have been possessed.
- Well, he was a raw youth.
- Raw youth? He was an idiot.
And he acted insulted and injured!
Well, I hear he was a gambler.
- You know, he could be your double!
- Oh, really? How novel.
Son, for long years, I have saved this piece of land for you.
Look. It has a house on it.
It's a nice little house, too.
You haven't wasted your life, I see.
Don't let any strangers come on it.
No. No strangers.
You're a major loon, you know that?
- Next year...
- Yes?
- I expect to build a guest house.
- Oh, a little tiny guest house with a handball court, and a little, swimming pool for fleas or something.
Yes, well, you'll want to get some rest in your rubber bedroom now.
Who are you?
I am an angel of God.
You're kidding!
Fear not, Boris.
You have led a just life.
And at the last minute before the execution, the Emperor plans to pardon you.
Really?
He will make a great personal show of his generosity and you will have learned your lesson.
But you will not be executed.
Then there is a God! Incredible!
Moses was right.
He that abideth in truth and will have frankincense and myrrh smeared on his gums in abundance and he shall dwell in the house of the Lord for six months with an option to buy.
But the wicked man...
The wicked man shall have all kinds of problems.
His tongue shall cleave to the roof of his upper palate and he shall speak like a woman, if you watch him closely.
And he shall... He shall...
The wicked man shall be delivered into the hands of his enemy whether they can pay the delivery charge or not.
And... And... Wait, I have more about the wicked man.
I shall walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death.
In fact, now that I think of it,
I shall run through the Valley of the Shadow of Death
'cause you get out of the valley quicker that way.
And he that hath clean hands and a pure heart is okay in my book.
But he that fools around with barnyard animals has gotta be watched.
I thank you.
All right, Grushenko, come on, let's go.
You guys are late.
I've been waiting here since 6:30.
You're awfully cheerful.
Yeah, you know how it is when you're extra brave.
Probably not.
Busy day? Are you guys having a sale?
Oh, no blindfold. That's for losers.
I like to see where the bullet hits.
I learned that during the war.
I was decorated, you know. Yeah.
Wonder what the Emperor's doing today.
Ready.
You guys want to move a little closer?
You don't wanna miss, you, know.
Looks bad on the report.
Aim.
Boy, the Emperor's really cutting it close.
What a flair for the dramatic.
That old sly boots.
Fire!
It's a very complicated situation,
Cousin Sonja.
I'm in love with Alexi. He loves Alicia.
Alicia's having an affair with Lev.
Lev loves Tatiana.
Tatiana loves Simkin.
Simkin loves me.
I love Simkin, but in a different way than Alexi.
Alexi loves Tatiana like a sister.
Tatiana's sister loves Trigorian like a brother.
Trigorian's brother is having an affair with my sister, whom he likes physically, but not spiritually.
Natasha, it's getting a little late.
The firm of Mishkin and Mishkin is sleeping with the firm of Taskov and Taskov.
Natasha, to love is to suffer.
To avoid suffering, one must not love.
But then one suffers from not loving.
Therefore, to love is to suffer, not to love is to suffer, to suffer is to suffer.
To be happy is to love.
To be happy, then, is to suffer, but suffering makes one unhappy.
Therefore, to be unhappy one must love, or love to suffer, or suffer from too much happiness.
I hope you're getting this down.
I never want to marry.
I just want to get divorced.
Oh, look! Look, it's Boris.
Boris! Boris, what happened?
- I got screwed.
- How?
I don't know. Some vision came and said that I was gonna get pardoned, and they shot me.
You were my one great love.
Oh, thank you very much. I appreciate that.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm dead.
- What's it like?
- What's it like?
You know the chicken at Tresky's restaurant?
- Yeah.
- It's worse.
Worse than the chicken at Tresky's.
Oh, well, life must go on.
The last traces of the shimmering dusk are setting behind the quickly darkening evening and it's only noon.
Soon we shall be covered by wheat.
Did you say, "Wheat"?
Wheat.
Wheat. I'm dead, they're talking about wheat.
The question is, have I learned anything about life?
Only that... Only that human beings are divided into mind and body.
The mind embraces all the nobler aspirations, like poetry and philosophy, but the body has all the fun.
The important thing, I think, is not to be bitter.
You know, if it turns out that there is a God,
I don't think that He's evil.
I think that the worst you could say about Him is that basically He's an underachiever.
After all, you know, there are worse things in life than death.
I mean, if you've ever spent an evening with an insurance salesman, you know exactly what I mean.
The key here, I think, is to not think of death as an end, but think of it more as a very effective way of cutting down on your expenses.
Regarding love...
You know, what can you say?
It's not the quantity of your sexual relations that count.
It's the quality.
On the other hand, if the quantity drops below once every eight months,
I would definitely look into it.
Well, that's about it for me, folks.
Goodbye.
MAN: Ten-hut!
Be seated.
Now, I want you to remember...
...that no bastard ever won a war...
...by dying for his country.
He won it...
...by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.
Men...
...all this stuff you've heard about America not wanting to fight...
...wanting to stay out of the war...
...is a lot of horse dung.
Americans...
...traditionally love to fight.
All real Americans love the sting of battle.
When you were kids...
...you all admired the champion marble shooter...
...the fastest runner, big-league ball players, the toughest boxers.
Americans love a winner...
...and will not tolerate a loser.
Americans play to win all the time.
I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed.
Thaùs why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war...
...because the very thought of losing...
...is hateful to Americans.
Now...
...an army is a team.
It lives, eats, sleeps, fights as a team.
This individuality stuff is a bunch of crap.
The bilious bastards who wrote that stuff about individuality...
...for the Saturday Evening Post...
...don't know anything more about real battle than they do about fornicating.
Now we have the finest food and equipment...
...the best spirit...
...and the best men in the world.
You know...
...by God, I actually pity those poor bastards we're going up against.
By God, I do.
We're not just going to shoot the bastards...
...we're going to cut out their living guts...
...and use them to grease the treads of our tanks.
We're going to murder those lousy
Hun bastards by the bushel.
Now...
...some of you boys...
...I know are wondering...
...whether or not you'll chicken out under fire. Don't worry about it.
I can assure you...
...that you will all do your duty.
The Nazis...
...are the enemy.
Wade into them!
Spill their blood!
Shoot them in the belly!
When you put your hand...
...into a bunch of goo...
...that a moment before was your best frienÔs face...
...you'll know what to do.
There's another thing
I want you to remember.
I don't want to get any messages saying we are "holding our position."
We're not "holding" anything.
Let the Hun do that.
We're advancing constantly. We're not interested in holding on to anything...
...except the enemy.
We're going to hold on to him by the nose and kick him in the ass.
We're going to kick the hell out of him all the time...
...and we're going to go through him like crap through a goose!
Now...
...there's one thing...
...that you men will be able to say when you get back home.
And you may thank God for it.
Thirty years from now when you're sitting around your fireside...
...with your grandson on your knee...
...and he asks you:
"What did you do in the great
World War II?"
You won't have to say:
"Well...
...I shovelled shit in Louisiana."
All right, now, you sons of bitches...
...you know how I feel.
I will be proud...
...to lead you wonderful guys into battle anytime...
...anywhere.
Thaùs all.
The Arabs need food and clothing.
They strip our dead before we can even bury them.
Looks like the reports were pretty accurate.
Sixty-one armored vehicles,
45 tons of ammunition...
...twenty-five 40mm guns, three self-propelled 105s.
Not counting mortars, machine guns, rifles...
...pistols, telescopes, belt buckles,
GI socks.
One thousand, eight hundred men.
Our people salute you, general...
...for your brilliant amphibious landing on the continent of Africa...
...and for your enlightened administration of our country.
I've enjoyed being here, Excellency.
Naturally, I'd prefer to be in Tunisia fighting the Germans.
"The lions in their dens tremble at his approach."
I appreciate that, Excellency.
Magnificent!
I wish our troops looked that good.
Tell me, general, what do you think of Morocco?
I love it, Excellency.
Iùs a combination of the Bible and Hollywood.
BRADLEY: These men fight at Kasserine?
CARVER: Yes, sir.
For the American Army to take a licking like that...
...the first time at bat against the Germans...
Up against Rommel, what we need is the best tank man we've got.
Somebody tough enough to pull this outfit together.
- Patton?
- Possibly.
God help us.
Lieutenant...
...where is the duty officer?
Sir...
- He said he's caught at shaving.
- Why isn't he here on duty?
Guess he needed a shave.
We got a new commanding general due today.
MAN: Who the hell is kicking me in the butt?
Oh, sorry, sir.
- What were you doing down there?
- Trying to get some sleep, sir.
Well...
Get back down there, son.
You're the only son of a bitch here who knows what he's trying to do.
Yes, sir.
PATTON: Brad, how the hell are you?
- Fine, George. Good to see you.
We were all under the impression you wouldn't be here until 0900.
Yes, I gathered that.
- You know my boy, Dick Jenson.
- Yes.
Brad, tell me.
- What are you doing here?
- Ike wanted a report on Kasserine.
Meanwhile, I have to stay here as an observer...
...but I report directly to Ike.
You're spying.
Get me General Eisenhower's headquarters.
Tell me, Brad...
...what happened at Kasserine?
I heard it was a shambles.
Apparently, everything went wrong.
We'd send over a 75mm shell, the krauts would return an 88.
Their tanks are diesels.
Even when we managed to hit one they kept on running. Our tanks...
The men call them
"Purple Heart boxes."
One hot piece of shrapnel and the gasoline explodes.
I warned them about the tank.
I talked to one of the soldiers about the half-tracks.
I asked them if the machine-gun bullets pierced the armor.
And he said, "No, sir.
They just come through one side and rattle around a bit."
I understand they had a little trouble coordinating the air cover.
The trouble was no air cover.
- General Smith on the line, sir.
- Excuse me, Brad.
Bedell?
Listen, I'm calling about Bradley and his job here.
I need a good number-two man, I want to make Brad my deputy commander.
You clear it with Ike?
All right, thanks, Bedell.
Now you're not spying for Eisenhower anymore, you're working for me.
- Okay?
- Fine, okay.
Dick. You got those stars?
- Yes, sir.
- Leùs get them on.
Whaùs the matter, Brad?
I've been nominated by the president.
I know, but it doesn't become official until iùs approved by the Senate.
Well...
...they have their schedule and I have mine.
George...
...if you were named admiral of the Turkish Navy...
...I believe your aides could dip into their haversacks...
...and come up with the appropriate badge of rank.
Anyway, congratulations.
Premature congratulations.
You know...
I think those stars look better on a green shirt.
Did I ever tell you about the time I designed a uniform for tank crewmen?
It was green leather, it had red stripes...
...and sort of a row of brass buttons down across here.
And topped off by a gold football helmet.
The Army rejected it, of course.
Goddamn, it was beautiful.
Lloyd Fredendall is just leaving.
George, there's one other thing I put in my Kasserine report.
Some of our boys were just plain scared.
Thaùs understandable.
Even the best foxhound is gun-shy the first time out.
I can remember...
...when nothing frightened me as much as the idea of...
...a bullet coming straight for my nose.
I don't know why, but the image of a bullet coming right for my nose...
...was more horrible than any other possibility.
Well, I can understand that, with such a handsome nose.
You want to know why this outfit got the hell kicked out of it?
Blind man could see it in a minute.
They don't look like soldiers.
They don't act like soldiers.
Why should they fight like soldiers?
You're absolutely right.
The discipline's pretty poor.
In about 15 minutes we're going to start turning these boys...
...into fanatics, razors.
They'll lose their fear of the Germans.
I hope to God they never lose their fear of me.
Up bright and early, general?
Breakfast?
Have all my officers finished breakfast?
We're open from 6 till 8.
Most of the officers are just coming in, sir.
Please inform these officers the mess hall is closed.
But, sir! Iùs only a quarter to 8.
From now on, you will open at 6 and no one will be admitted after 6: 15.
Where are your leggings?
Leggings? Well, hell, general, sir,
I'm a cook.
You're a soldier.
$20 fine.
Gentlemen...
...from this moment any man...
...without leggings, without a helmet, without a tie...
Any man with unshined shoes or soiled uniform...
...is going to be skinned.
This is a barracks.
Iùs not a bordello.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
Doctor.
Sir.
I understand you have two cases of self-inflicted wounds.
Yes, sir, we do.
Get them out of here.
One has developed a serious infection.
I don't care if he dies, just get him out of here.
Doesn't belong in the same room with men wounded in battle.
- I'll see that they're moved.
- One more thing.
There'll be no "battle fatigue."
Thaùs an order.
Battle fatigue is a free ride to the hospital.
I'm not going to subsidize cowardice.
Yes, sir.
Doctor...
Where's your helmet?
I don't wear a helmet in the hospital.
Start.
I can't use my stethoscope when I'm wearing my helmet.
Well...
...then cut two holes in your helmet so that you can.
And get those yellow-bellies out of here, today.
Hold it.
Turn right, here.
The battlefield is ahead.
Don't argue.
I can smell a battlefield.
He was out here yesterday.
Iùs over there. Turn right, damn it.
It was here.
The battlefield was here.
The Carthaginians defending the city...
...were attacked by three
Roman legions.
They were brave, but they couldn't hold. They were massacred.
Arab women...
...stripped them of their tunics and their swords and lances.
The soldiers lay naked in the sun...
...2000 years ago.
I was here.
You don't believe me.
You know what the poet said:
"Through the travail of ages
Iùs the pomp and toils of war
Have I fought and strove and perished
Countless times upon the star
As if through a glass and darkly
The age-old strife I see
Where I fought in many guises
Many names
But always me."
You know who the poet was?
Me.
There's an opportunity for us to mount an offensive.
We've concentrated on the flank...
...draw strength from the British.
It appears now that we could...
...split the African corridor.
Drive through Rommel to the sea.
I'm sorry, but that territory has been reserved...
...for General Bernard Law Montgomery.
We're supposed to let him win this one no matter what.
They're entitled to have their hero.
Montgomery did push Rommel clear across North Africa.
What about the Americans?
Don't they need a hero too?
You have anybody in mind?
Air Vice-Marshal Coningham is here with General Buford.
Excuse me, gentlemen...
...while I ask our British friends whaùs happened to our air cover.
BRADLEY:
Harry.
How are you?
George. Good to see you.
- You know Arthur Coningham.
- Sir Arthur.
Delighted to see you.
I've heard so much about you.
Gentlemen, it appears there's been a slight misunderstanding here...
...and Ike thought we should fix it.
No, no. No misunderstanding.
We're supposed to have Allied air cover and we don't.
German planes are strafing my troops.
If I may say so, general, I'm afraid your operation reports are inaccurate.
Report? Three days ago, the crowds took off after my command car...
...ran my ass into a ditch.
My staff has assured me, we have complete air supremacy...
...everywhere in the Mediterranean.
PATTON:
When I complained about air cover...
...you said our troops were not battleworthy.
You spoke of the discredited practice of using air force as an alibi...
...for lack of success on the ground.
I have to wet-nurse Montgomery,
I don't have to stand for that.
I sincerely apologize for that remark, whoever made it.
And I promise you one thing, general:
You will see no more German planes.
We were discussing air supremacy,
Sir Arthur.
Damn door won't open!
By God, thaùs enough!
Get that thing out of here!
Come on, you bastards, take a shot at me on the nose!
Get back in here, George! We need a corps commander, not a casualty.
CONINGHAM:
How'd you manage to stage that?
I don't know...
...but if I could find the Nazis flying those things...
...I'd give them each a medal.
PATTON: Can't get over how cold it gets in the desert.
Awfully cold, sir.
PATTON: Rommel's out there somewhere, waiting for me.
JENSON:
Yes, sir.
PATTON:
You know...
...if I had my way, I'd send that genius son of a bitch...
...an engraved invitation in iambic pentameter:
A challenge in two stanzas to meet me alone in the desert.
I'll deliver it.
Rommel in his tank and me in mine.
We'd stop about 20 paces.
We'd get out, we'd shake hands...
...then we'd button up and do battle, just the two of us.
That battle would decide the outcome of the war.
Iùs too bad jousting's gone out of style.
Iùs like your poetry, general.
It isn't part of the 20th century.
You're right, Dick.
The world grew up.
Hell of a shame.
Dick, I want a 24-hour guard put around this area.
If we don't, the Arabs will dig them up for their clothes.
Yes, sir.
Our graves aren't gonna disappear like everybody else's who fought here.
The Greeks, Romans, Carthaginians.
God, how I hate the 20th century.
General.
General?
We intercepted a German radio message.
Rommel's 10th Panzer is going to hit us near El Guettar.
Rommel, huh?
All my life...
...I've wanted to lead a lot of men in a desperate battle.
Now I'm going to do it.
Look.
Battalion strength at least.
They haven't spotted our positions yet.
They'll get an education in about 10 seconds.
Wait till they get a dose of that artillery fire.
Commence firing.
Fire at will.
Commence firing. Fire at will.
Commence firing. Fire at will.
What a hell of a waste of fine infantry.
- Get General Bradley on the radio.
- Yes, sir.
Sir, I can't raise him.
Go tell him to hit them hard. Here's where we hold them by the nose...
...and kick them in the ass.
Go on.
Put him in my car.
Rommel...
...you magnificent bastard.
I read your book!
PATTON: Captain Richard N. Jenson was a fine boy.
Loyal, unselfish and efficient.
I am terribly sorry.
There are no coffins here since there is no wood.
We will have a trumpeter and an honor guard...
...but we will not fire the volleys as people would think an air raid was on.
I enclosed a lock of Dick's hair in a letter to his mother.
He was a fine man...
...and a fine officer.
And he had no vices.
I shall miss him a lot.
I can 't see the reason such fine young men get killed.
There are so many battles yet to fight.
NARRATOR: Battle-weary, but victorious, American Gls and Tommies...
...of the British 8th Army meet in an Allied victory celebration...
...at Wadi Akarit in North Africa.
For the first time in this war,
Broadway and Piccadillyjoin hands.
Meanwhile, General Montgomery, hero of El Alamein...
...continues to lead his victorious British 8th Army...
...in a relentless drive against
Rommel's vaunted Africa corps.
General Bradley's done a tremendous job with 2nd Corps.
He's moved into Bizerte and taken over 41,000 prisoners.
Good. Very good.
You're not surprised, are you?
After all, you trained that outfit.
- Excuse me, general.
- Hm?
This is interesting. We've discovered
Rommel wasn't present at El Guettar.
- Who says so?
- G2, sir.
When we took 10th Panzer,
Rommel was in Berlin with an earache?
Severe nasal diphtheria, sir.
Also, Hitler probably retained Rommel in Berlin...
...because things were going badly for the Africa Corps.
He didn't want his favorite general to lose face.
I'm my favorite general, and I don't like to be told...
...that some second-stringer is up against me. Then I lose face.
Who the hell are you, anyway?
CARVER: General, this is Lieutenant
Colonel Codman. Your new aide.
Codman. I pulled your name off the list because I know your family.
I'm glad you did, sir.
Rommel is the best the krauts have, and I kicked the hell out of him.
Now my own G2 section is telling me he wasn't even there.
But, general, he undoubtedly planned the German battle.
If you defeat Rommel's plan, you've defeated Rommel. Isn't that true?
Codman...
- Have a drink with me tonight.
- Yes, sir.
I have a plan for the invasion of Sicily.
I want to make sure I get it approved.
You can help me.
I want to give a dinner for General Alexander.
Get to him before Montgomery does.
This will be strictly a formal affair,
Codman, but purely social.
By that I mean...
...purely political.
- Yes, sir.
I want the finest food, the best wine available. Everything, comme il faut.
Thank you.
George, this is really splendid wine.
Thank you, Arthur.
Thank you.
Sir Harold, I think it was Alcibiades in the Peloponnesian War...
...415 B.C.
He said, "If Syracuse falls, all
Sicily falls, and then Italy."
He knew that Syracuse was the jugular of the island.
Old Alcibiades always went for the throat.
I propose to take Sicily in the same way.
- How's it going?
- The old man has them in his pocket.
PATTON:
Now, according to my plan...
...General Montgomery will land here.
I'll hit the beaches here, take Palermo.
Monty will drive north on the coast,
I'll come due east...
...take Messina and cut off the German escape route.
Yes...
It looks like an interesting plan.
Well, gentlemen, to the conquest of Sicily.
ALEXANDER:
To the conquest of Sicily.
OFFICERS:
To Sicily!
George, you'd have made a great marshal for Napoleon...
...if you'd lived in the 18th century.
But I did, sir. I did.
Morning. Is General Smith in?
MAN: I believe he's in the lavatory.
- Thank you.
- Ah, there you are, Bedell.
- Monty.
Bedell, I've been giving a good bit of thought to the Sicily operation.
Yes?
I assume we're alone.
Georgie Patton has already discussed his plan with Alexander.
I realize that...
...but I have an idea that his plan may lead to an absolute disaster.
Oh?
Bedell, look.
This is Sicily.
Now then, according to Patton's plan...
...I will attack Syracuse here.
And he would attack Palermo up here.
Now, obviously our forces would be divided.
And obviously, they could be chopped up piecemeal.
Now then, what I propose, and what
I shall insist on, by the way...
...is this.
I will land at Syracuse as planned.
But the Americans-
The Americans will land here, at Gela.
I will advance north to Messina, the Americans protecting my flank.
After all, Messina is the key.
Iùs the reason for invading Sicily.
I'll discuss your plan with Ike.
I'm sure he'll give it serious consideration.
- Amusing, isn't it?
- What?
That the plans for the invasion of Sicily...
...should have been put forward in an Algerian lavatory.
George, I have bad news for you about your Sicily plan.
Ike has turned it down.
Since the Italians will be defending their native soil for the first time...
...and the German resistance is stiffening, we shouldn't be divided.
- Well, where do my people land then?
- In the Gulf of Gela.
There's nothing there but a beach.
Yes, but it puts you in a good position to support Montgomery.
Where does Montgomery land?
He'll land in Syracuse and drive north to Catania. Possibly even Messina.
And you'll be alongside, protecting his left.
I see.
In other words, we get the burden again while good old Monty gets the glory.
Ike had to consider all points of view.
He made his decision not as an
American, but as an Ally.
Had it been the other way around,
I assure you, Monty would protest.
No...
...I've been in the Army 30 years.
When I get an order, I say, "Yes, sir."
And I do my best to carry it out.
This is what happens when your commander stops being an American...
...and starts being an Ally.
I don't think I've made myself clear, sir.
Iùs true, Montgomery met the toughest resistance there at Catania.
However, if we're-
Perfectly clear.
Old Monty is as stuck as a bug on flypaper.
But this order from
General Alexander...
...directing you to turn over the
Vizzini-Caltagirone road to Montgomery.
Well, then, old Bradley will have to slug- slug, mind you...
...his way up center of the island over those tough mountain roads, won't he?
Yes, sir.
Messina, Bell.
Messina...
...is the heart of it. If they'd followed my plan, I'd be there by now.
I'd cut off the retreat of every
German on this island!
Now, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go to Palermo.
I'm gonna beat that limey at Messina if iùs the last thing I ever do!
Hey, whaùs all this talk about taking the Vizzini road away from 2nd Corps?
General Alexander's orders.
Road goes to Montgomery.
Now, that road was assigned to me.
How can I get north without it?
You know the terrain there.
I'm sorry, Brad. But Monty's run into tough opposition. Very tough.
You wouldn't be taking advantage of this situation, would you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Without that road, your army, except for my 2nd Corps...
...would be out of a job.
Free for you to go into Palermo.
Who said anything about Palermo?
I can read a map.
Does Alexander know you've pushed out this far?
Thaùs a reconnaissance in force.
George...
...are you saying I've got to slug it out in those mountains...
...with heavy resistance?
Just so you can make a bigger splash than Monty?
General...
...I just follow my orders.
Like the simple old soldier I am.
General Bradley.
Sir, General Alexander has heard we're moving west.
He says here, "Stop immediately.
Go no farther than Agrigento.
Repeat. Stop, immediately."
Thaùs what you think it says.
I think it was garbled in transmission.
Ask them to re-transmit the message.
Thaùll take half a day at least.
Yes, sir.
Now, Brad.
Where were we?
We were talking about a simple...
...old soldier.
Look at that, gentlemen.
Compared to war...
...all other forms of human endeavor shrink to insignificance.
Leùs go, sergeant.
Move out!
Give me that helmet.
Come on, leùs get out of here!
What silly son of a bitch is in charge of this operation?
I don't know, but they ought to hang him.
PATTON:
Afternoon, Padre.
PADRE: These men are here from the
States, looking over our program...
...for the spiritual welfare of the men.
We'll take you right into Palermo.
Col. David toured us around your quarters...
...and I saw a Bible by your bed.
Do you actually find time to read it?
I sure do.
Every goddamn day.
Sir, Patton's taken Palermo!
Damn!
Palermo's the most conquered city in history.
First the Phoenicians...
...the Romans,
Carthaginians, Byzantines.
Then came the Arabs...
...Spaniards, Neapolitans.
Now comes...
...the American Army.
This is from General Alexander, sir...
...reminding you that you are not to take Palermo.
Send him a message, Cod.
Ask him if he wants me to give it back.
PATTON: Let me ask you a question for a change.
You've just come from Washington.
How do they feel about our boys taking Palermo?
The general impression is, your army barreled through token resistance...
...while Montgomery faced the brunt of the fighting.
Don't they know we took on the Hermann Gˆring division?
Toughest outfit in the German Army.
The people at home are interested in you.
They're curious about your pearl-handle revolvers.
They're ivory. Only a pimp from a New Orleans whorehouse...
...would carry a pearl handle.
What about your language?
When I want it to stick,
I give it to them loud and dirty.
What do your troops feel about that?
I don't want these men to love me.
I want them to fight for me.
Ernie Pyle says you have a secret weapon here: General Bradley.
Ernie calls him "The GI General."
Omar Bradley is no secret.
He's a damn fine commander.
MAN:
Whaùs your feeling about Montgomery?
PATTON:
He's the best general the English have.
He seems more concerned with not losing than he does about winning.
He's not aggressive enough, is that correct?
Look, I've been getting into a lot of trouble lately.
Yesterday, the office told me that my Italian prisoners...
...didn't have enough latrine.
They didn't know what a latrine was till I showed them.
If I've said anything too critical of my British colleague...
...leùs forget about it.
I will tell you one thing, though.
Off the record.
I'm gonna beat that...
...gentleman to Messina.
Ah, Freddie. Do you realize what this madman Patton is saying?
He's going to save our skins by taking Messina.
This report might interest you.
Here I am in these bloody marshes, fighting malaria and Germans...
...while he's taking Palermo and getting all the glory.
Well!
Now he's up against three good
German divisions and he's stuck.
He's not going to get Messina.
Thaùs reserved for the
British 8th Army and me.
Iùs time for a move, Lucian. Terry
Allen's 1 st Division is bogged down.
You're bogged down too.
What we need is another end run just to break things loose.
- Lucian. How's my fighter?
- Fine, George.
Come in, come in. We need another one of your amphibious specialties.
Lucian, I want you to send a reinforced battalion by sea...
...to make a landing up here at Brolo behind the kraut lines.
You want me to do a land-based attack.
Right. I want a coordinated attack the morning of the 11 th.
I don't think we can make it by the 11 th.
- Hell, iùs only 15, 20 miles.
- My boys have been dying for yards.
Hm.
Maybe you better kick a few butts if you have to.
I recommended you for your DSM in your last promotion.
I know what you can do when you put your mind to it.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry, but I can't do the impossible.
You're too old an athlete to think you can postpone a scheduled match.
You're an old athlete yourself.
You know matches are postponed.
If we can't back Lucian up by land, our end run could be a disaster.
Those men might get caught on the beach and cut to pieces.
- Whaùs the matter?
BRADLEY: All we're saying is...
...not to rush in until we're ready.
Give him an extra day.
Just one more day.
The landing is on.
We're going to Messina.
We're going to get there before
Montgomery does.
- Whaùs so important about that?
- General Truscott...
...if your conscience won't permit you to conduct this operation...
...I'll find somebody who can.
General, iùs your privilege to relieve me anytime you want to.
This match will not be postponed.
Any questions?
No, sir.
You're a very good man, Lucian.
You want to guard against being too conservative.
Remember what
Frederick the Great said:
"L 'audace, I'audace!
Toujours I'audace!"
Go on, have a drink.
Excuse me, sir, I won't be drinking for the next couple of days.
If anything happens to those men,
I'd like to be there with them.
You're not going, so forget about it.
You believe Truscoùs right?
No.
But you're gambling with those boys' lives...
...just to beat Montgomery into Messina.
If you pull it off, you're a hero, but if you don't...
What happens to them?
The ordinary combat soldier.
He doesn't share in your dreams of glory, he's stuck here.
He's living out every day, day-to-day, with death tugging at his elbow.
There's one big difference between you and me, George.
I do this job because I've been trained to do it.
You do it because...
...you love it.
The men on the beach are catching hell, general.
The men are doing their best.
We have no replacements.
I can't break through to the coast.
I'm going down there myself.
PATTON:
Colonel!
How did he get over there?
PATTON:
What the hell are you waiting for?
Looking for a place to ford, general.
I sent a patrol to reconnoiter.
PATTON: I've done that. Down there this sewer's no more than 3 feet deep.
Get that outfit cranked up or you'll be out of a job!
- And put that helmet on.
- Yes, sir.
Move it! Leùs go!
- Whaùs holding up this column?
- I don't know, sir.
Planes!
Come on, move it!
Pull up over there.
- Come on.
- Whaùs going on here?
Sir, these mules-
Jackasses!
You let a column get stalled and strafed on account of two jackasses?!
No. No.
Now, dump them over the side and clear this bridge!
We're pinned down because we can't get air support!
Nobody's getting any air support!
Put fire into this battalion, or I'll get somebody who can.
Major!
- You the executive officer here?
- Yes, sir.
- Your name?
- Walker.
You're now commanding officer.
You've got 4 hours to break through that beachhead.
If you don't make it, I'll fire you.
50,000 men on this island would like to shoot that son of a bitch.
Please take me home.
Take me home.
Please take me home.
Take me home.
- There he goes, "Old Blood and Guts."
- Yeah, our blood. His guts.
Hi, how are you, son?
Where are you from, Gomez?
California, sir.
Me too.
- Where were you hit?
- In the chest, sir.
Well...
...this might be interesting to you.
The last German I saw had no chest.
Didn't have any head either.
You get well quickly, son.
Whaùs the matter with you?
I guess I just can't take it, sir.
What did you say?
Iùs my nerves, sir.
I just can't stand the shelling anymore.
Your nerves?
Hell, you're just a goddamn coward.
Shut up!
I won't have a yellow bastard crying...
...in front of these brave, wounded men.
Shut up!
Don't admit this yellow bastard.
Nothing wrong with him.
I won't have sons of bitches afraid to fight stink up this place of honor.
You're going back to the front, my friend.
You may get shot, you may get killed, but you're going up to the fighting.
Either that or I'll stand you up in front of a firing squad.
I should shoot you myself, you bastard! Get him out of here!
Send him up to the front!
You hear me? You goddamn coward!
I won't have cowards in my army.
I had to kick a few butts...
...but Truscott finally broke through to those people on the beach.
Have you seen the casualty lists?
Yes, I've seen them.
Whaùs the word from the coast road?
The 3rd Division's east of Brolo, heading toward Messina.
Leùs get over there.
I want to go in with the troops.
You go ahead, George.
I'm not very good at that.
General Bradley...
...iùs time to consider how many casualties we'd have...
...if we were still crawling on that goddamn road.
Forward, march!
Don't smirk, Patton.
I shan't kiss you.
Pity. I shaved close this morning to prepare for getting smacked by you.
Forward, march!
You wanted to see me, George?
Got a letter here from Ike.
I was rereading Caesar's
Commentaries last night.
In battle, Caesar wore a red robe to distinguish him from his men.
I was struck by that fact because-
"Despicable." First time anybody's ever applied that word to me.
Well, at least iùs a personal reprimand, iùs not official.
The man was yellow. He shoulÔve been tried for cowardice and shot.
People have taken a lot worse than a little kick in the pants.
I ruffled his pride a bit.
Whaùs that compared to war?
Two weeks ago at Palermo they said
I was the greatest general...
...since Stonewall Jackson.
- Now they draw cartoons about you.
Dirty bastard!
They got me holding a little GI and kicking him with an iron boot.
You see that, whaùs on my boot?
A swastika.
On my boot.
An iron boot with a swastika!
"You will apologize to the soldier you slapped...
...to all doctors and nurses present in the tent at the time...
...to every patient in the tent who can be reached...
...and last but not least to the 7th Army as a whole...
...through individual units, one at a time."
God, I...
...feel low.
PATTON:
Oh, God...
...Thou art my God.
Early will I seek Thee.
My soul thirsteth for Thee.
My flesh longeth for Thee in a dry and thirsty land.
So as I have seen Thee in the sanctuary.
My soul followeth hard after Thee.
But those that seek my soul to destroy it...
...shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
They shall fall by the sword.
They shall be apportioned for foxes.
But the king shall rejoice in God.
Everyone that sweareth by him shall glory.
But the mouth of them that speak lies...
...shall be stopped.
Ten-hut!
PATTON:
At ease.
I thought I'd stand up here and let you people see...
...if I am as big a son of a bitch as some of you think I am.
I assure you I had no intention...
...of being either harsh or cruel in my treatment of the...
...soldier in question.
My sole purpose was to try to restore in him...
...some appreciation of his obligations as a man...
...and as a soldier.
If one can shame a coward...
...I felt one might help him to regain his self-respect.
This was on my mind.
Now, I freely admit...
...that my method was wrong...
...but I hope you understand my motive...
...and will accept this...
...explanation...
...and this...
...apology.
- Dismissed.
- Ten-hut!
Good evening, general. I want to report on a private poll I'm taking.
What poll?
The fan mail.
Eleven percent con,
89 percent pro.
And that 11% of protest, in most cases, is both obscene and anonymous.
But the pro letters are mostly from relatives and servicemen.
"I want you to know we're proud our son is serving in your army.
From the newspaper, we're not clear exactly what you did and why...
...but we want you to know we're for you.
Keep going, and God bless you."
Keep going, huh?
Where?
I thought you might like a sip of wine, general. Iùs New Year's.
You didn't celebrate at all last night.
I'm sick of sitting around this...
...royal doghouse.
We've taken Sicily.
I'm ready for a new assignment.
Maybe you've got it.
Here's a radio message, just came in.
Cod.
I've been relieved.
They've relieved me from command of the 7th Army.
I don't believe it.
Happy New Year.
Just a minute, sir.
Since they're sure to give you another command...
...isn't it logical they'd relieve you here first?
You mean command of all American troops going into Europe?
Iùs possible. I know iùs been discussed from time to time.
The logic of it is so obvious, it couldn't mean anything else.
Sir, I'm going to open this bottle of wine.
No, Sir Cod...
...but if you find a bottle of cognac,
I'll help you drink it.
- How you feeling tonight, general?
- Not bad, not bad at all.
- Get me some writing paper, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Your wife ever give you the devil for not writing?
All the time, sir.
Only I don't write as often as you do. Don't seem to get around to it.
Lucky for us we got them.
Who wants to marry a couple of broken-down old horse captains?
Thaùs what my wife says to me every time I come home, sir.
Why are you up so late, George?
Thought you'd like a nice hot bath or something.
I got this sleeping pill from the doc, just in case you need it.
Sleeping pill!
- Whaùs going on here?
- I heard the news, sir.
- They announced it on the radio.
- What news?
About General Bradley, sir. How they gave him the top American command.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
I just thought you might be feeling kind of low, sir.
Your writing things, sir.
Here on the desk, sir.
Yeah. Thank you, George.
One little dog face.
One measly little slap.
Thaùs what done it.
Ah, George.
I wish I'd kissed the son of a bitch.
He's paying tribute to the Free French
Forces under DeGaulle and Leclerc.
And to the people of the Resistance...
...who risk their lives to help destroy the Germans.
"France will be free again.
I give you my word."
"Just as Free French troops liberated
Corsica, Napoleon's place of birth...
...I will someday land in France to liberate the birthplace of Lafayette."
General, the reporters would like a word with you.
- Good afternoon.
- General.
Can you tell us the purpose of this visit to Corsica?
General Eisenhower ordered me here.
You wrote the mother of the boy you slapped, "The rat shoulÔve been shot."
- Is that true, general?
- No comment.
Sir, I understand
Gen. Alexander suggested...
...you take over Gen. Clark's
Italian campaign...
...but it was killed due to the incident.
- No comment.
- Can you say where you're going, sir?
Off the record,
Eisenhower's ordered me to Malta.
Interview concluded.
You plan on slapping any soldiers there, general?
PATTON: In 1528, these forts were defended by...
...400 Knights of Malta and 800 mercenaries...
...against a force of 40,000 Turks.
Codman.
- Still no word from Gen. Eisenhower?
- No, sir.
Not even a response about the two turkeys I sent for Christmas?
No, sir.
Go ahead, gentlemen.
Take a closer look for yourselves.
Looks like you boys have hitched your wagon to a falling star.
Pass the word.
If anyone wants out, I'll understand.
Sir, I can speak for the entire staff.
We want to stay with you, no matter what duty you're assigned to.
Up in London, they're planning the invasion of Europe.
I've trained my mind, body and spirit for that.
What, in GoÔs name, am I doing here?
All right.
Leùs get on to Cairo.
See if the pyramids are still standing.
- This place is for me?
- Yes, sir. This way, sir.
Whoever found it has a genius for cloak and dagger.
Who picked this cathouse?
I think it was Gen. Smith, sir.
To spite me, that son of a bitch.
- Welcome to London, Georgie.
- Bedell. How are you?
- Is Ike here?
- He asked me to brief you.
Would you excuse us, please?
Let me put you straight about Ike.
We hear a lot about you criticizing his decisions.
Not really. You know me.
I'm just an old fool.
At times, I do wonder whether he isn't a limey at heart.
George, this is the toughest coalition ever attempted in history.
Ike's trying to hold it together and lick the Germans at the same time.
- Iùs a hell of a job.
- I understand.
You have an important assignment connected to the Normandy invasion.
Good. I've studied the Overlord Plan and there's a number of flaws in it.
You can't depend on Monty taking
Cannes by D-day. He'll never make it.
I've drawn up an alternate plan to land at Calais...
...following an air bombardment-
- Will you just listen for a change?
Ike stood by you when everyone,
I mean everyone...
...wanted Patton with a rope around his neck.
We're gonna let it leak out that you are here undercover.
That you're preparing to invade at the Pas de Calais.
We hope to pin down the German 15th Army there...
...so that they can't be used against us at Normandy.
Is that all I'm good for?
We're going to build an army of 12 divisions around you.
All fictitious, of course.
Dummy troop concentrations, dummy landing craft...
...simulated radio traffic.
The Germans are convinced that you will lead the main invasion effort.
Their agents will spot you soon...
...then we can move you to Knutsford.
- What do I do there?
- Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Frankly, George, you're on probation.
Take my advice and behave yourself.
Remember...
...your worst enemy is your own big mouth.
Look at this nasty-faced son of a bitch. Ready for combat.
I'll call him William as in "the Conqueror."
- Sir, should we leave him in the car?
- No. Good afternoon, ladies.
Good afternoon.
Watch this, Cod.
- Sir, he'll kill that dog.
- I'll hold him.
I'm terribly sorry, general.
Did Abigail frighten your dog?
Thaùs quite all right, madam.
This way, sir.
Your name isn't William.
Iùs Willie.
WOMAN:
My dear friends.
General George S. Patton, Jr., has accepted our invitation...
...to say a few words to you...
...on the occasion of this inaugural ceremony.
General Patton is not here in an official capacity...
...and I have assured him most earnestly...
...that nothing he says will be quoted.
May I present General Patton.
- Remember, sir, watch your language.
- Yeah.
My dear ladies.
Until today...
...my only experience at welcoming has been...
...to welcome Germans and Italians to the infernal region.
At this I have been quite successful...
...since the troops, which I have had the honor to command...
...have, to date, killed or captured...
...some 170,000 of our enemies.
I feel that such clubs as these are of very real value...
...because I believe with Mr. Bernard Shaw...
...that the British and the Americans are two peoples...
...separated by a common language.
Since it is the destiny of the British and Americans to rule the world...
...the better we know each other...
...the better we will do it.
The Russians, don't forget the Russians.
I think that a club like this...
...is an ideal place for promoting mutual understanding.
Because as soon as our soldiers meet and get to know the English ladies...
...and write home and tell our women just how lovely you truly are...
...then the sooner the American ladies will get jealous...
...and force this war to a quick termination.
And then I'll get the chance to go to the Pacific and kill Japanese.
NARRATOR:
All over the nation...
...mass meetings are held to protest
General Patton 's statement...
...that Britain and America will rule the post war world.
That Russia will have no say.
Congressional leaders like Senator
Clayburn Foss are quick to react.
This man has insulted our Russian allies...
...implying Anglo-American world rule.
In my opinion, he should be severely disciplined.
This time I didn't do a damn thing.
They promised there wouldn't be any reporters.
I made a few remarks off the record.
Ike told you to keep your mouth shut.
You know how suspicious the Russians are of the British and us.
I was only trying to be polite to the old ladies.
If I'd seen the Russians there, I'd have mentioned the sons of bitches.
Bedell, I don't know anything about politics.
I have no political ambitions.
All I want to do is to command an army in combat.
Well, iùs out of our hands now.
Ike sent a message last night to the chief of staff.
Now iùs up to General Marshall whether you stay here as a decoy...
...or he sends you home.
He's a good man.
At least he's a fair man.
I'll let it sit with him.
PATTON:
George...
...our war is over.
Over, sir?
Iùs just a question of waiting for the orders now.
I feel I'm...
I'm destined to achieve some great thing. What, I don't know.
But this last incident is...
...so trivial in its nature and so terrible in its effect-
It can't be an accident.
It has to be the work of God.
Yes, sir.
The last great opportunity of a lifetime...
...an entire world at war and I'm left out of it?
No, sir.
God will not permit this to happen!
I am going to be allowed to fulfil my destiny!
His will be done.
NARRATOR: In the greatest amphibious operation ever attempted...
...a predawn naval bombardment prepares the way...
...for allied soldiers to assault the Normandy beaches...
...and claw out a desperate foothold on the continent of Europe.
I knew Montgomery couldn't take Caen on D-day or D-plus-10. And I said so.
And here they are all hung up in the hedgerow country.
They should pivot the way von
Schlieffen planned it in World War I.
Then we might get a chance to do some real broken field running.
But they don't listen to me.
What a way to enter the continent of Europe.
Along with all the rest of the spare parts.
Sir, everything on this plane is high priority.
Gen. Bradley wouldn't send for you unless he had something in mind.
I'll tell you, Cod.
I've learned my lesson.
If I ever do get another chance,
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.
I'm gonna play the game.
If I forget, you remind me.
- I'll give a gentle nudge in the ribs.
- Give me a swift kick in the ass.
Yes, sir.
Welcome to France, sir.
Hope the war's still on.
Where's the boss?
Right this way, sir.
Patton, haven't seen you since Messina.
How are you?
You're doing a splendid job decoying the Jerries.
You'll forgive me,
I'm off to the front.
Best of everything, old boy.
By the way...
...intelligence confirms that I'm against Rommel again.
Rommel.
Hi, how are you, George?
- Pretty fair, Brad. How are you?
- Fine.
Well. My, my.
Isn't this plush?
Looks like you're bucking for archbishop.
Chet Hansen had this rig built for me.
George, sit down.
Ike wanted me to talk to you since we can level with each other.
Thaùs right.
We're making 3rd Army operational when I take over 12th Army group.
Do I get it?
I'll be honest with you.
I've had reservations.
You've been my senior ever since
I left the academy.
You were the boss in North Africa and Sicily and I just thought...
...well, it might be a problem for us.
It wouldn't bother me.
There's one other thing.
We're different kinds of people.
Goddamn it, Brad, you're always right.
With your brains and my screwy ideas, we make a great team, like in Sicily.
Truthfully, if I had been your senior in Sicily, I would have relieved you.
Brad...
...I'm not crawling on my belly to get a command.
For GoÔs sake, get me in this fight.
The only way out of the doghouse is to do something great.
I gotta get back in the war!
Hitler's own people tried to kill him a few days ago.
First thing you know, iùll be over and...
I'll...
...keep my mouth shut.
I'll behave myself.
I give you my word.
George...
...I've been working on a plan called Cobra.
I'd like your opinion.
We've been slugging through hedgerow country...
...half an acre a day and we've got to find a way out.
I want to use this road.
The Saint LÙ-Periers road.
Monty will pin down the enemy forces at Caen.
We'll pulverize an area
31/2 miles wide with bombing.
Then seven divisions will follow.
The 3rd Army will swing around here, a sweeping end run right across France.
What do you think?
I think you'll need a screwball old cavalryman to command the 3rd Army.
George...
...Ike came to that conclusion in London three months ago.
He what?
Why, that dirty-!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I promise to keep my mouth shut.
George could have the courtesy to tell us where he's going.
Good God, look at that.
Where you going, general?
Berlin.
I'm going to personally shoot that paper-hanging son of a bitch.
Hold it. Hold it!
This place isn't on the map.
You know why?
We've run clear off the map.
Give George a headline, and he's good for another 30 miles.
SOLDIER:
Atten-hut!
Hold it!
Pay attention. We're gonna clean this mess up right now.
Leùs move this vehicle out this way.
This one out this way.
Back that thing up there, and we'll take this one here.
All right, get up off your ass.
Leùs go now!
Thaùs it.
Thaùs the way to move.
Good boy. All right, come on.
Come on, now. Here we go. Come on.
Thaùs it!
Thaùs it! Gun it!
Gun that thing!
Okay, come on.
Watch it!
Go, go, go! Come on.
Hold it up.
Come on, baby. Yeah, yeah.
Come on.
Thaùs it.
Come on, now.
- Chet.
- Yeah, will do.
Come on, keep coming. Keep coming.
Hold it up there.
Now come on! Hold it!
Hey, dummy, hold the fricking tank!
Thaùs it. Come on.
Good boy.
- Hold it up there.
- General!
General Bradley wants to have a word with you.
Okay. Come on!
Okay. Hold it up. Take over.
George, you'd make a good traffic cop.
George this drive has been magnificent...
...but I'm sorry to say
I have to slow you down.
- What the hell for?
- We'll have to cut off your supplies.
Gasoline, ammunition, everything.
We're up against new priorities.
- I think I smell Montgomery.
- Take it easy, George.
There are serious issues involved.
Political issues.
By God, it is Montgomery.
The launching sites for the B-2 bombs are all in his area.
Churchill wants those bases destroyed.
Hitler kills more civilians in London than soldiers.
Expect Montgomery to do anything?
You give me gasoline and I'll gain ground with it, kill Germans too.
Give me 400,000 gallons.
I'll go to Berlin.
George, I can't do it.
The Siegfried line is an empty shell.
They stripped the equipment and sent it east.
Iùs crawling with cows.
I can punch through in two days.
There's no use in arguing with me.
It wasn't my idea.
Why did you pick me to command?
I didn't pick you.
Ike picked you.
George, you have performed brilliantly.
You are loyal, dedicated.
You're one of the best I've got, but you don't know when to shut up.
George, you're a pain in the neck.
I have a lot of faults, Brad.
But ingratitude isn't one of them.
I owe you a lot.
Hell, I know I'm a prima donna.
I admit it.
What I can't stand about Monty is, he won't admit it.
Captain, the Bailey's run out of gas.
The point tank has run out too.
And there's a kraut column up ahead.
Yeah, I know.
PATTON:
Were you in command here, captain?
I was in command.
My tank platoon was supporting an infantry company.
Tanks ran out of gas, so we had to fight it out.
We started 11:00 last night.
Finished a couple hours ago.
This morning the fighting was hand-to-hand.
I had a dream last night.
In my dream it came to me...
...that right now the whole Nazi Reich is mine for the taking.
Think about that, Cod.
I was nearly sent home in disgrace.
Now I have precisely the right instrument...
...at precisely the right moment of history and exactly the right place.
The Saar?
This will change too, very quickly.
Like a planet spinning off into the universe.
A moment like this won't come again for 1000 years.
All I need is a few miserable gallons of gasoline.
Right now, the weak spot is here.
In 10 days, we could be in Berlin.
What about the fortifications that were done in Metz?
Fixed fortifications, huh?
Monuments to the stupidity of man.
When mountain ranges and oceans could be overcome...
...anything built by man can be overcome.
You know how I'm sure they're finished out there?
The carts.
They're using carts to move their wounded and the supplies.
The carts came to me in my dream.
I couldn't figure it out.
Then I remembered...
...that nightmare in the snow.
The agonizing retreat from Moscow.
How cold it was.
They threw the wounded and what was left of the supplies in the carts.
Napoleon was finished.
Not any color left.
Not even the red of blood.
Only the snow.
Look at this, Cod.
I love it.
God help me, I do love it so.
I love it more than my life.
NARRATOR: Paris is liberated, and French troops lead the way.
The Allies march into the city after four years of Nazi occupation.
The hard-fighting French
2nd Armored Division...
...under Major General
Jacques Leclerc...
...gets an unforgettable welcome...
...as they enter their beloved Paris.
In a powerful drive to the north...
...General Montgomery cuts off and bypasses the French coastal towns...
...of Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk.
Pushing on to capture the vital
Belgian port of Antwerp.
Meanwhile, the main body of Patton 's army...
...resupplied now and rolling like a juggernaut, slashes toward the Saar.
Nazi resistance appears to crumble.
It seems that nothing can stop our troops from driving on into Germany.
- Sir, General Bradley on your line.
- Good, good.
Brad, listen, I've got a bridgehead across the Saar.
I'm on my way to Germany.
Wait a minute, George.
There's a lot of trouble up north.
I want you to transfer tank armor to Middleton's 8th Corps right away.
Brad, you can't do that.
George, listen.
I don't have time to argue.
There's a lot of enemy activity up around Ardennes.
No, I don't know how serious it is...
...but Ike wants us to meet with Bedell Smith tomorrow at Verdun.
Be there at 1100.
Yes, sir.
PATTON: There's absolutely no reason for us to assume...
...that the Germans are mounting a major offense.
The weather is awful and their supplies are low.
The Germans haven't mounted a winter attack since Frederick the Great.
Therefore I believe thaùs exactly what they're going to do.
I want you to start making contingency plans...
...for pulling out of our eastward attack.
Changing directions 90 degrees, moving up to Luxembourg.
Don't look so stunned, gentlemen.
I want you to plan for three possible axes of attack.
From Diekirch, due north.
From OrlÈans to Bastogne.
From Neufch‚teau against the German left flank.
We've identified four German armies:
The 7th, the 5th Panzer,
6th SS Panzer and the 15th.
They've hit us with 26 divisions.
They've overran two regimens of the 106th Division.
And 7500 of our men were forced to surrender.
Our concern is that von Rundstedt...
...has the 101 st Airborne trapped here at Bastogne.
Bastogne, by the way, is the key to this entire area.
If we can hold it, we can break up the entire German offensive.
If they take it, we're in serious trouble.
Ike wants to know if anybody can go...
...and relieve the 101 st before they're torn to pieces.
There's nothing Montgomery can do.
At any rate, not for some weeks.
What about you, George?
I can attack with three divisions in 48 hours.
I'd give myself some leeway.
Ike wants a realistic estimate,
George.
You're in the middle of a fight now.
Iùs over a hundred miles to Bastogne.
My staff's already working out the details.
Frankly, I don't see how iùs possible.
Not in this kind of weather.
I should have thought you'd want to fall back and regroup.
Not me. I don't like to pay for the same real estate twice.
TEDDER:
But what about your men?
You can't cart them off 100 miles, expecting them to attack without rest.
I trained these men.
They'll do what I tell them to do.
We hadn't realized you were so popular with your troops, general.
I'm not. They'll do it because they're good soldiers.
And because they realize, as I do, that we can still lose this war.
Then I think I can speak for Field Marshal Montgomery.
He'd say you're asking the impossible of your men.
Of course he would.
Cause he's never realized thaùs what we're in business for.
General McAuliffe refused a German surrender demand.
You know what he said?
What?
He said, "Nuts."
Keep them moving, colonel.
A man that eloquent has to be saved.
This is where it pays off.
The training and discipline.
No other outfit in the world.
Pulled out of a winter battle, move a hundred miles.
Going to a major attack with no rest, no sleep, no hot food.
God! God, I'm proud of these men!
Sir, von Rundstedùs thrown another panzer division against Bastogne.
101 st Airborne's barely holding on.
We need damned air cover. If we had decent weather, we might make it.
CARVER:
General Mason, sir.
Hello, Mase?
Listen, we're short on foot soldiers.
Cannibalize your antiaircraft units and turn them into riflemen.
Yes, every last one you can find.
Good evening, general.
I just got the weather report for tomorrow. More snow.
There goes our air cover.
We may have to wait for better weather.
Brave men dying up there. I won't wait, not an hour, not a minute.
Going to keep moving.
Is that clear?
We're going to attack all night and attack tomorrow morning!
If we're not victorious...
...let no one come back alive.
You know something, general?
Sometimes, they can't tell when you're acting and when you're not.
It isn't important for them to know.
Iùs only important for me to know.
- You want to see me, general?
- Oh, yeah, chaplain.
I'm tired of 3rd Army having to fight Germans...
...with supreme command, no gasoline...
...and now this ungodly weather.
I want a prayer, a weather prayer.
A weather prayer, sir?
Yes, leùs see if you can't get God working with us.
Gonna take a thick rug for that kind of praying.
I don't care if it takes a flying carpet.
I don't know how this will be received, general.
Praying for good weather so we can kill our fellow man.
I assure you, because of my relations with the Almighty...
...if you write a good prayer, we'll have good weather.
And I expect that prayer within an hour.
Yes, sir.
"Almighty and most merciful Father...
...we humbly beseech Thee...
...of Thy great goodness...
...to restrain this immoderate weather...
...with which we've had to contend.
Grant us fair weather for battle.
Graciously hearken to us...
...as soldiers who call upon Thee...
...that armed with Thy power...
...we may advance from victory to victory...
...and crush the oppression...
...and wickedness of our enemies...
...and establish Thy justice...
...among men and nations.
Amen."
Weather's perfect.
Cod, get me that chaplain.
He's in good with the Lord and I want to decorate him.
Hiya, general!
NARRATOR: Supported by medium bombers and fighter bombers...
...flying sorties against German positions...
...elements of the 3rd Army...
...spearheaded by the
4th Armored Division...
...drive into Bastogne...
...to relieve its 18,000 defenders...
...on the day after Christmas.
During this operation,
3rd Army moved farther and faster...
...and engaged more divisions in less time...
...than any other army in the history of the United States.
Excuse me, sir.
General Katkov would like to know if you'll join him...
...to drink to the surrender of Germany.
My compliments to the general.
Please inform him that I do not care to drink with him...
...or any other Russian son of a bitch.
Sir...
...I cannot tell the general that.
You tell him that.
Tell him word for word.
The general says he thinks that...
...you are a son of a bitch too.
Okay. I'll drink to that.
One son of a bitch to another.
Is it true that Roosevelt, before he died...
...promised you a command in the Pacific?
Yes. But now that he's gone, I don't think there's much chance of that.
Doug MacArthur doesn't want me up there.
We're told of "wonder weapons" the Germans were working on:
Long-range rockets, push-button bombing...
...weapons that don't need soldiers.
"Wonder weapon"?
My God, I don't see the wonder in them.
Killing without heroics. Nothing is glorified, nothing is reaffirmed.
No heroes, no cowards, no troops.
No generals.
Only those that are left alive and those that are left...
...dead.
I'm glad I won't live to see it.
REPORTER: Iùs said you're still using former Nazis in key positions.
Despite the denazification policy.
Well, if I'm supplied with trained personnel...
...I'll get rid of the Nazis.
Until then, I'll use them to keep the railroads and telephones working.
After all, didn't most ordinary Nazis join the Party...
...in about the same way Americans become Republicans or Democrats?
Yes, thaùs about it.
You agree that national policy be made by civilians, not by the military?
Of course. But the politicians never let us finish.
They always stop short and leave us with another war.
You thinking about our Russian allies?
Did you say if you found your army between the Germans and the Russians...
...you'd attack in both directions?
No, I never said that.
I never said any such thing.
But I wish I had.
Sir, there's a call on your line from supreme headquarters, General Smith.
Bedell?
Ike is furious.
How could you compare Republicans and Democrats to the Nazi Party?
And the statement that you refuse to denazify...
...has the Russians, the British, everybody, screaming.
Well, the hell with the Mongoloid Russians.
We've given them Berlin, Prague,
God knows what else.
They gonna dictate policy too?
George, don't be a fool.
The war in Europe is over.
Washington dictates policy.
The war shouldn't be over. We should stop pussyfooting about the Russians!
We'll have to fight them anyway. Why not do it now, when the army's here?
Instead of disarming Germans leùs get them to help fight the Bolsheviks.
You better shut up.
This line may be tapped.
I don't care. I'll tell you...
...we've been fighting the wrong people.
You and I don't have to get involved, you're so soft about it.
Leave it to me. In 10 days
I'll have us at war with them...
...and make it look like their fault!
George, you're mad.
You're absolutely out of your mind!
Well, I'm no diplomat.
I'm a combat soldier.
Thaùs all they understand.
Get Ike to give me the word, and I'll kick them back to Russia!
Shall I call the artist back, sir?
Oh, the hell with it.
Nobody wants to see a picture of me.
I'm mad!
Don't you know that?
Field Marshal Montgomery, his majesty is prepared...
...to receive the next chief of the imperial general staff.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Take care of yourself.
George.
Well, gentlemen...
...all good things must come to an end.
And the best thing thaùs happened to me...
...in my life...
...has been...
...uh...
...the honor...
...and privilege...
...of commanding the 3rd Army.
Goodbye...
...and God bless you.
Brad...
...they've taken the 3rd Army away from me.
I know.
I thought we could have dinner together tonight.
Thank you, Brad.
Thaùs damn thoughtful.
I appreciate it.
Right now, I think I'll take
Willie for a walk.
George, look out!
After all I've been through...
...imagine getting killed by an oxcart.
No, Brad, there's only one proper way for a professional soldier to die.
Thaùs from the last bullet of the last battle of the last war.
At least the 3rd Army earned its pay.
In our drive across Europe, we liberated...
...12,000 cities and towns...
...and inflicted a million and a half enemy casualties.
I sense from now on, just being a good soldier won't mean a thing.
I'm afraid we're gonna have to be diplomats, administrators, you name it.
God help us.
George, I want to say one thing.
You've done a magnificent job here in Europe.
Thaùs right, George.
That soldier you slapped did more to win the war than any other private.
I'll see you for dinner.
Six-thirty?
PATTON:
For over a thousand years...
...Roman conquerors returning from the wars...
...enjoyed the honor of a triumph, a tumultuous parade.
In the procession came trumpeters and musicians and strange animals...
...from the conquered territories...
...together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments.
The conqueror rode in a triumphal chariot...
...the dazed prisoners walking in chains before him.
Sometimes, his children, robed in white...
...stood with him in the chariot, or rode the trace horses.
A slave stood behind the conqueror...
...holding a golden crown...
...and whispering in his ear a warning...
...that all glory...
...is fleeting.
SUBTITLES CORRECTED: ASIFAKHEIR
Darling Drusilla...
I have existed from the morning of the world...
...and I shall exist until the last star falls from the heavens.
Although I have taken the form of Gaius Caligula,
I am all men as I am no man and so...
...I am a god. by anoXmous https://thepiratebay.se/user/Zen_Bud/
What's it like with Marcellus?
- With what like?
He's so fat. It's disgusting.
- He's not.
He's only large.
- And tiny where it counts.
How do you know?
- I saw him at the baths.
Poor... poor Drusilla.
- You are vile.
Hold.
- Messenger to the Prince.
Identify yourself.
- Macro.
Password?
- Justice.
Prince?
Forgive me, Prince.
The Emperor commands you to wait upon him.
What does he want?
A last look at you perhaps.
He is 77.
May he live forever.
How is Ennia?
My wife lives only for the day she can see you again, Prince.
Wait outside.
What does all this mean?
- Take care, little boots.
Pray to Isis for me.
- I'll follow you as soon as I can.
I hate coming back here, Macro.
He's planning something.
You've nothing to fear.
I command Praetorian guards.
With Tiberius, there's always something to fear.
Be very careful of Nerva.
They say he can even tell what you're thinking.
Nerva.
Prince.
- Dear friend.
Ten years is a long time for the Emperor... to be hidden away.
I should feel a great deal happier...
...if he were back in
Rome where he belongs.
Tell me, how is the Emperor?
- Old, like me.
I mean, how is his mood?
Like the weather.
But the weather's good today.
Changeable.
I've heard that during the last month seven of my... colleagues in the senate have been put to death.
...for treason.
Nine to be exact.
Five of them cheated.
They killed themselves.
That wasn't playing fair.
Don't you agree, Nerva?
They were all good men.
If they were good men, how could... the Beloved Emperor find them guilty?
You have a gift for logic, Prince.
Caligula.
Beloved grandfather.
- Do your dance, boy.
My dance?
- Yes.
The one that you delighted the army... with when your father made you its mascot.
Come on.
Little boots.
I'd forgotten it, Lord.
- Oh, dance for me.
Delight me.
Dance.
My little fishies.
Fishies.
Why not?
My little fishies. Come in.
All of you.
Stop that.
Out, little fishes.
You've had enough for today.
Caligula.
- Yes, my Lord?
Why do you say such monstrous things... about me at Rome?
I hear you often pray for my death.
- I don't, Lord, ever.
You do not?
By Heavens, Caesar,
I swear I do not.
Yo do not in...
...in public.
Never, Lord.
Remember this.
That I have let you live...
...so far.
My little fishies love me.
Innocents, you see.
I protect their innocence.
This is the least I can do.
For it is a foul world.
Rise up.
Nerva is scowling at us.
Help me, Nerva.
Help me tranform this young barbarian... into a Roman caesar.
There have been three Roman caesars.
Julius, Augustus and yourself.
Which do you want him to be?
- Best.
That would be your father, Augustus.
You see, Caligula, I'm insulted to my face.
Nerva, dear friend.
Watch out for Macro when I'm dead.
I know. He hates me...
- ...because you are wise.
Because you are good.
So when I'm gone, watch out for Macro.
I've taken my precautions, Caesar.
Hmm. What might they be?
Heaven help Rome, when I'm gone.
I am old.
Yes, Lord, but you will live forever.
All my family are dead but you, child Gemellus and that,...
...Claudius, that uncle.
The others struck down by fate.
And it is fate, little boots, that rules us, not any god.
You are a god, Lord.
No, I'm not.
Not even when I'm dead.
Julius Caesar and
Augustus Caesar, they are gods.
So say the Senate... and so the people prefer to believe.
Such myths are useful.
Little boots, just look at you.
- Yes, Caesar?
I am nursing a viper in Rome's bosom.
Uncle.
Caligula.
Do you think this boy's been drinking?
I think he has, Caesar.
- So do I. Macro.
Yes, Lord?
- Bring him more wine.
And waste none.
Remove your bootlaces.
And what do thet say of me at Rome?
Oh, well, they need you,
Lord and they miss you.
Most of my life I have given to the Roman people.
I have fought.
I have given all.
Aren't they lovely?
- Yes, Lord.
The Satyrs are from Illyria.
And... uh...
This Nymph... is from...
Where are you from?
Britain, Lord.
Britain.
Speaking statues.
Yes, yes. And they do more than speak. They do...
You prefer nymphs to satyrs?
- I like both, Lord.
One needs both.
Yes. To keep healthy.
Rome is a republic and you and I are plain citizens.
More conviction!
That's it.
That's the best of my stallions.
Serve the state, Caligula, although the people in it are wicked beasts.
But they love you, Lord.
- Oh, no. No.
They fear me.
And that is much better.
I had no choice, you see.
No choice.
No choice?
All I wanted was private life.
I did not truly want to become emperor, but I had to.
Had to?
If someone else had become emperor,
I would have been killed.
As you will be.
Will be?
Will be gra... gr...
Will be, Grandfather?
Would be, if you were not my heir.
When Rome was just a city and we were just... citizens, known to one another, you see?
Why, we were frugal, good, disciplined and dignified!
The Romans I rule are not what they were.
They lust... they lust for power and pleasure.
Money... the wives of other men...
Oh, yes,
I am a true moralist.
And stern as any Cato.
Fate chose me to govern swine in my old age...
I am become a swine-herd.
Do you think this boy has he drunk enough wine?
I think he's drunk enough, Lord.
So do I.
Now he is happy.
Homer. You would not know that,
You were educated in army camps only.
You will know enough to be a swine-herd.
Caesar? The Senate sends these documents for your signature.
Of course.
The revised list of candidates for the equestrian order.
I, Tiberius Caesar, command in the name of the Senate and the people ... of Rome.
Tax assessment, for Asia Minor,
Brescia and Gaul.
I, Tiberius Caesar, command on the name... of the Senate and the people of Rome.
Senator guilty of treason.
Every senator believes himself to be a potential
Caesar, therefore every senator is guilty of treason.
In thought, if not in deed.
The Senate is the natural enemy of any Caesar, Little Boots.
Remember that.
Traitors. Look at them.
Traitors.
They offered to approve any law I made before I made it.
I said: 'What if I go mad?
What then?'
No answer.
They were born to be slaves,
Germanicus, never forget that.
I'm not Germanicus, Lord.
I'm his son, Caligula.
Yes. And your friend is Macro.
He serves you and only you, Lord.
- And his wife is your friend, too.
Is she friendly in bed?
- We must ask Macro that, Lord.
She seems friendly.
- And your sister, Drusilla...
My sister is my sister, Lord.
I know everything that is said and done.
And thought.
The setting sun and the rising moon.
Gemellus, lovely boy.
And too young to betray me.
Perhaps not too young.
Yes. Kiss your old grandfather.
Yes. My last grandson.
I am your grandson, too, Caesar.
- By adoption.
This is the last flesh of my flesh.
Poor boy.
What is to become of you?
He's like a brother to me, Lord.
Brother?
Another brother is enough envy.
Brother kills a brother... who's killed his father who's killed his son.
Fate! Drink, Caligula.
After you, dear brother.
Poor boy.
When I am gone,
Caligula will kill you.
And then, someone will kill Caligula.
Unless... unless he is dead, before I am.
You are looking not well at all.
I, Caligula Caesar,... command in the name of the
Senate and people of Rome.
A brother kills a brother, who's killed his father... who's killed his son... Fate!
And then someone must kill Caligula...
He's going to kill me.
Shh. You're safe. You're with me.
He's going to kill us.
Just as he killed our father, our mother and our brothers.
I am not going to die!
- You won't.
You're his heir.
There is no one else.
Yeah, there is.
There's Gemellus and Claudius.
Gemellus is too young,
Claudius is an idiot...
...and Tiberius is old.
You will be emperor. Soon.
And you will be my queen.
- You can't marry your sister.
You can in Egypt.
- But we're in Rome...
...and you're already promised.
I know... To Ennia.
It's only a bird.
Prince?
- Hmm? What is it?
My wife.
Ennia.
Now you are a man, Caligula.
What are you going to do?
You must be the master of your own destiny.
Take it... with both hands.
Cretins!
Why did you permit him to do it?
Bind his wrists.
Bind his wrists.
You must not go, you must not leave me.
You're my friend, my only friend.
I've lived too long, Tiberius,
I hate my life.
Leave us.
Both of you.
For a man to choose the hour of his own death... is the closest he will ever come to tricking fate.
And fate decrees that when you die,
Macro will kill me.
I'll arrest him and have him executed.
You can't. He controls you.
Anyway, even with Macro dead, how could I go on living with this reptile?
You will respect my friend always, won't you, reptile?
I've always respected him, Lord.
You hear?
- Tiberius, you were wise once.
Ah, don't taunt me, I'm old.
- I watched you grow into a monster.
One by one, I've seen you murder your family, your friends, the noblest men in Rome.
That is treason?
- No, it's the truth.
I am an old has-been surrounded by enemies.
In my own family, in the Senate...
You're cruel.
You're cruel.
No, honest old men can sometimes see the future.
So, from evils past and evils yet to come...
...I now choose to escape.
So these are your precautions, Nerva?
Nerva, what's it like?
- Warm, no pain, just drifting away.
Do you see her?
- Who?
The Goddess, Isis.
Oh, you're one of those who believe...
Do you see her?
No.
- Are you sure?
You're almost dead. What's it like?
What's happening to you now?
Nothing.
- You're lying.
You can see her.
I know you can. What is she like?
No... nothing at all...
...just... sleep...
Liar.
Since Nerva died, Tiberius has been half paralyzed.
They say he's close to death.
- Tiberius dies, be worse for us.
You love the bastard.
- Take that back!
Prince, the physician Charicles.
How is the Emperor?
How long will he last?
Well, it could happen any moment, but with care he might last a year or so.
I can smell death...
...but whose?
Don't worry. He can do nothing without me.
So these poor unfortunate creatures... thought...
...and where are they?
No, Macro. He's planning something.
You'll be emperor, soon.
You swear.
- I sw...
I swear.
Leave.
Everyone leave.
Tiberius.
Tiberius.
Caligula?
Lord.
Give me my ring.
No.
- Yes.
You... do not dare.
Prince.
You do not dare.
Hail, Caesar.
Hail, Caesar.
I'd get everyone assembled in the hall.
For the announcement.
Gemellus?
Gemellus.
Hail, Caesar.
Gemellus. We are alone.
We must love each other.
Rest, Tiberius Caesar.
Hail, Caligula Caesar.
It's just like the dream.
It's only his mask.
You are Caesar now.
Caesar.
Caesar, Emperor of Rome, lord of the world.
Lord of the world...
I liked this dream.
At the...
At the insistence of the Senate and the People of Rome...
...I accept... humbly...
...the highest office of our great republic.
Our great republic.
Where's the onion?
Give me the onion.
When our beloved Tiberius was dying...
To the Tiber with Tiberius.
- Yes. Yes.
Throw him in the river.
- Yes. Yes.
Tiberius. Throw him.
Throw him to the dogs.
Yes. Yes.
Today we begin a new era.
I grant a general amnesty.
Hail.
- Hail. Hail. Hail.
Caesar. Caesar.
Caesar. Caesar. Caesar.
Caesar. Caesar.
Caesar. Caesar. Caesar.
Silence.
- Caesar. Caesar.
Caesar. Caesar. Caesar. Caesar.
Silence.
- Caesar. Caesar.
Great Caesar is not finished.
As my fellow Consul, the Senate and the people of Rome...
...have wisely chosen my learned uncle Claudius.
Hail, Cladius.
Take your place beside me, Claudius.
Ceasar Caligula...
- Take your place...
I mean Consul...
I herewith adopt as my son and heir...
...the Prince Gemellus.
Come forward, Prince.
- Hail, Gemellus.
From this moment, all official oaths... will contain the following phrase:..
'I will value neither my life, nor the lives of my children...'
'...any more highly than I do the Emperor.'
Hail. Hail. Hail.
'And of his sister, Drusilla.'
Hail Drusilla.
- Hail Caligula.
We must be careful of him.
Oh, Claudius?
- No, Gemellus.
Oh, yes. Gemellus.
Did you see their faces when I told 'em
I had to swear not only to me?
But to you?
They were appalled.
I do hope so.
- But is it wise?
I can do...
...anything I like...
...to anyone.
- Well, don't start with me.
Who do you suggest?
Get out. Out.
Who?
- Why not start with Macro?
Macro?
- Yes.
Before he controls you as he controlled Tiberius.
Superb. Splendid, Macro.
Superb.
Fetch me Gemellus.
- What? Here?
Yes, here. Now.
Charicles.
- My Lord?
Stand here.
I want a bonus for my guards.
Oh, but Caesar, that's not possible.
All things that happen are possible, Longinus.
Make the impossible happen, then it'd be possible. Logical?
How, Caesar?
The deficit, you see, is...
Look, how much is my purse?
Well, Lord, that is as much as you may require.
Oh, good.
Ah, Macro.
Would you stand over there?
Longinus, you here.
- Yes, Caesar.
Gemellus. I want you to look at these gentlemen very carefully.
Take your time and tell me...
...who killed our beloved Tiberius?
Who killed Tiberius?
He did. Macro.
Murderer.
Arrest him.
In honor of your new commander,
Chaerea...
...ten gold pieces to every man.
Hail. Hail. Hail.
Chaerea, arrest Macro.
- Guards, arrest Macro.
Don't you dare.
Forgive me, Caesar...
Ah, Caerea.
Two senators beg to see you.
They have a disputable land.
And they wait your judgment.
- Ah, bring them in.
Bring them in.
I'm interested in all that is Rome, even down to the length of the Toga.
Come now.
Caesar, I must complain about the vow...
Give me the documents.
Guilty.
- Thank you. Thank you.
Don't thank.
Justice must always be impartial.
It is so, Chaerea. Is it?
- Yes.
You may go.
Ennia.
You look beautiful.
Is it good for growing hair?
We'll be married soon.
Divorce will only take a few days.
I think we should move.
- Move? Where?
Alexandria, say.
To Egypt?
Yeah.
What do you think?
I'd hate to leave Rome.
I mean, the Senate...
No, no, Ennia. I am Rome.
Wherever I am, Rome is.
There is the Senate and the People of Rome.
You, don't make me laugh.
The way you say that!
Ah, Longinus.
- Forgive us, Caesar.
Longinus, is it done?
The Senate has sentenced him to death.
The commission.
Chaerea, I now officially appoint you... commander of my imperial guard.
But what about Macro?
What happened? Where is he?
He has been arrested for treason.
- That's impossible.
Caesar, you know he worshipped you.
He made you.
Nobody made me.
- I... I can't believe it.
What did he do?
Ennia. I had to take my destiny, with my own hands.
Guards.
Guards.
Chaerea. She's to be banished.
I love you.
- To Gaul.
I love you.
Caligula. How could you do it?
He was your friend.
He would've done anything for you.
Don't send me away.
I love you.
Caligula.
Now at least she doesn't have to get a divorce.
But you still have to find a suitable wife.
No.
I'm going to marry you.
You can't.
We're not Egyptians.
I know.
We are much more beautiful.
Rome is not Egypt.
And stop looking at yourself like that.
Let's go to Egypt then.
- You are a fool.
Caesar cannot be a fool.
- But he's trying very hard.
Caesar cannot be a fool.
Little Boots. They'll throw you in the Tiber, if you attempt to move the government.
So, you are going to marry a respectable
Roman lady of the senatorial class.
No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
You've got to have an heir.
Who will kill me when he grows up.
The priestess of Isis are meeting at my house tonight.
You want me to marry one of them?
Yes.
No.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
I wonder what I should wear.
When is the performance for almighty Caesar?
Don't be disgusting.
But I'm being practical.
If I'm to choose a wife,
I want to see what I'm getting.
Logic.
Now that one looks rather interesting.
Livia? Oh, she's taken.
She's to marry
Proculus, one of your officers.
I'll send him to Spain.
She's a virgin. Very boring.
Not your style.
That will be my wife.
- Oh, no. Not Caesonia.
Oh. You're impossible.
She's the most mischievous woman in Rome.
Perfect.
Caesonia's been divorced.
She's extravagant. Always in debt.
I want her.
- But not for a wife.
Send her to me now.
No, Little Boots.
I won't let you do it.
It wouldn't be wise.
Yes.
Such as the will of the Senate and the People of Rome.
You're very convincing as a priestess, Caesar.
And you... as a sacrificial lamb, Caesonia.
I told Caesonia that
I would marry her.
Don't...
Ah, but only after she's born me a son.
How will you ever know it's yours?
Don't worry.
I've got her very well guarded.
Then you can be sure one of the guards will be the father.
They're all homosexuals who have been castrated.
If only all Rome had just one neck.
Is that the officer that
Livia's going to marry?
Yes. Proculus.
Proculus.
Longinus...
- Caesar?
...you see this young officer over here? Proculus?
Yeah?
Caligula Caesar,
Emperor of Rome.
Hail.
- Hail.
And the lady Drusilla and the lady Caesonia.
And the lady Drusilla and the lady Caesonia.
Hail.
- Hail.
Are we late?
- No, Caesar.
Do forgive us.
Was the ceremony beautiful?
The augury is good?
Yes, Caesar.
- Splendid.
You are very gracious to come.
You are a Roman hero.
Caesar.
I shall now bestow... the special blessings of almighty Caesar...
...upon this...
...happy union.
Which way is the secret marriage bed?
Ah. The kitchen.
Oh, this will have to do.
See you later.
Little Boots.
I thought you didn't like virgins.
I've never known any.
That is correct, Caesonia?
And now for Caesar's wedding gift.
What a delicious bride.
Take off that robe.
Splendid.
Is she really a virgin, Proculus?
- Yes, Caesar.
One can never be quite sure.
Open your eyes, Livia.
Lucky girl. To lose one's virginity...
...to a direct descent of the goddess Venus.
I...
...Caligula Caesar...
...command...
Open your eyes, Proculus.
...command in the name of the Senate... open 'em.
...the Senate and the People of Rome.
She really was a virgin.
Are you?
Well? Are you?
No, Caesar.
- No?
Well, Isis won't like that. One law... for woman, one for man.
That's not fair.
Come on.
Off with your clothes.
Splendid.
I like your nice bushy hair, Proculus.
Caesar. I beg you.
- So sit up.
I think you were lying to me.
You're a virgin, too.
I...
...Caligula Caesar...
...command... in the name of the Senate...
Open your eyes, Livia.
...and the People of Rome...
You see how I exhausted myself to make your wedding holy.
My blessings to you both.
Gemellus.
Caligula.
Caligula.
Gemellus.
Jupiter loves me.
Drusilla.
He's trying to kill me.
- Who, Little Boots?
Gemellus. I saw him. He ran away.
Wants me dead.
Now... now, Little Boots.
Now you'll be alright.
Now...
Hail, Caesar.
Hail.
- Hail, Caesar.
All hail Ceasar's beautiful horse, Incitatus.
Hail the most honorable Incitatus.
Hail, Incitatus.
There's Gemellus over there.
Watch him.
Chop chop, dear uncle, chop chop.
I want your honest advice.
Should I make myself king of Rome?
King?
Well, but this is republic, isn't it?
Very well, then.
I shall make myself king of the republic.
But you're already greater than any king, Caesar.
I am a god.
Or at least I will be when I'm dead.
Gemellus, try one of these morels.
Gemellus.
What's that smell?
- What smell, Caesar?
What have you been taking?
Just a medicine.
A bit to ward off the fever.
Did you give him medicine for the fever?
Well...
Yes or no?
- No, I daren't.
Gemellus. Are you accusing your sovereign of being a poisoner?
But I never accused you, Caesar.
You took an antidote before coming to my table.
Which is tantamount to accusing me of poisoning you.
That is logic! Is it not?
Caligula.
Chaerea.
Arrest Gemellus...
...for treason.
Guards. Take him away.
No.
No.
No.
No, please.
As if there ever could be an antidote against Caesar.
Drusilla.
Why are you so concerned for him?
I'm not concerned for him.
But for you.
- He knows about Tiberius.
He's a threat to me.
- He's not. He's not even your heir.
Caesonia now carries your child.
Gemellus will die.
- You amateur.
Amateur?
And they weren't even poisoned.
Caesar.
Well done.
What will you do to her?
What she said was treason.
I decide what is treason, not you.
Dance.
Dance?
- Yes.
And what about your son?
Show Incitatus your new dance.
My son...
...he will dance with you.
Music.
You are... beautiful...
...Drusil...
...beautiful.
We are all alone...
...Drusil.
He's going to kill me.
- No.
He can't kill me.
The fever must break soon.
- He's going to kill me.
What if it doesn't?
- He's going to kill me.
He's going to kill me.
Drusilla.
Drusilla.
He's going to kill me.
He's going to kill...
...me.
Drusilla.
Tell you...
...I love you.
Where is my sister?
- She's coming.
I'm here, Little Boots.
Drusilla...
...I'm dying.
- You are not.
I must...
...make my will.
Don't talk. Sleep.
Longinus.
I want Longinus.
Take my horse to his own bed.
He's a monster.
Even so, it's better that he doesn't die this time.
I don't see, why?
- The people love him.
There could be war, revolutions, civil chaos, if he dies.
He looks as if he's going to die anyway.
Longinus?
You call for me, Caesar?
My will.
Herewith, to my beloved Drusilla: the Roman Empire... title of Augusta... my little boots.
Little boo...
He's sleeping.
No, he's not.
Drusilla.
Why do I get angry with you?
Why do we always argue?
You can't help it.
We'll never quarrel again.
Oh, yes, we will.
Don't let me die.
My lady. You must not touch him.
The fever is contagious.
Sleep. You're safe now.
Drusilla's here.
I offer my life, if Jupiter will only spare our beloved Emperor.
Jupiter accepts your offer.
- Hmm?
Execute him.
The fever is breaking.
Do you hear that, Little Boots?
You're going to live.
Drusilla tells me that
I've been neglecting my work.
So I report for duty.
Your signature and seal is required, lord.
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name... of the Senate and the People of Rome.
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name of the...
...Senate... and...
...People of Rome.
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name... of the Senate and the People of Rome.
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name... of the Senate and the People of Rome.
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name... of the Senate and the People of Rome.
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name... of the Senate and the People of Rome.
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name... of the Senate and the People of Rome.
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name... of the Senate and the People of Rome.
Rome, Rome, Caesar, Caesar,
Rome, Rome, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name... of the Senate and the People of Rome.
No wonder life's so dull.
Yes, lord... oh... no, lord... and don't...
Let's see if Proculus can liven things up for us.
Proculus.
Do you know that his wife is expecting her first child?
We're not quite sure who the father is.
Him or... God.
Divine Caesar, please.
What have I done?
Why am I here?
Treason.
- I've always been loyal to you.
That is your treason.
You're an honest man, Proculus, which means a bad Roman.
Therefore you're a traitor.
Logical, hmm?
Now you must die like Gemellus.
Like all those who fail Rome.
Now slowly, very slowly.
I want him to feel death.
I want him to smell death.
Now. What does it feel like, Proculus?
Can you see the great goddess Isis?
What does she say?
Reptile.
Make a note of this.
I said slowly, you fool.
Lucky boy, to have escaped me so easily.
Longinus. Reptile.
Cut off those and send them to Livia...
...as a souvenir of their great love.
Caesar says, 'Cut them off.'
And now send the rest to Livia.
Curtain.
Child's head...
...has just appeared.
Is he alive?
- Yes, Caesar.
My lords.
I'm now to be married to Caesonia.
The mother of my son,
Caligula Germanicus.
Caligula. Caesonia.
Ring, ring. Give me the ring.
You are now wife, mother and Empress of Rome.
It's a girl.
It's a girl.
It is not a girl.
Did you not hear Caesar say?
I heard the voice of Caesar, but your daughter did not.
I should've waited, shouldn't I?
- There will be other children.
Longinus.
- Caesar?
One month of free games and a gold coin to every Roman...
...to celebrate the birth of my son.
My son... Julia Drusilla.
Julia Drusilla.
Drusilla?
Drusilla.
The fever.
- Drusilla.
The fever.
Drusilla.
I'm here...
...it's your Little Boots.
It's your Little Boots.
Do something.
I am doing everything I...
I can, Caesar.
I swear.
But the fever must take its course.
Great Isis. Save her.
Take me.
Caesar begs you, o mighty goddess.
Caesar.
Drusilla?
Get out. Get out.
Go on. Get out. Get out.
Get out. Go on.
Out. Out. Out.
Drusilla.
Almighty mother...
You...
I begged you...
Caesar begged you...
We, Caius Caesar
Caligula, do decree... one month of public mourning... for our beloved sister, Drusilla.
During which time anyone who laughs, bathes, dines with his parents or children... or has intercourse will be sentenced to death.
Such as the will of the Senate and the People of Rome.
[Caligula *** his sister]
Hello.
Come on, darling.
Caligula has finished.
Nestor restores the imperial heirs.
The slaves of Rome.
The people.
The army.
The tribune of the people.
The Senate.
And regning supreme... the Emperor.
Hail.
And I am... the lady Drusilla, his sister.
Let's make love once again, brother Nestor.
No. No.
Stop.
Stop.
No. Stop.
Another drunk.
Do you have any news of him?
According to one report, he's gone to Egypt.
And according to the other reports?
Well...
...to Greece...
...another, to Persia...
...to Carthage and another again, to Gaul.
And where do you think he is?
He could be anywhere.
- No.
He's here in Rome.
He's testing us.
Get off.
I have existed from the morning of the world, and I shall exist until the last star falls from the night.
Although I have taken the form of
Gaius Caligula, I am all men as I am no man.
Therefore I am...
...a god.
I shall wait for the unanimous decision of the Senate.
All those who say aye...
...say 'Aye.'
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
- Aye.
Aye.
- Aye.
Aye. Aye. Aye.
Aye. Aye. Aye.
He's a god now.
Aye. Aye. Aye.
Baa.
Baa.
- Baa.
Baa.
- Baa.
Baa.
- Baa.
Baa.
- Baa.
Baa.
- Baa.
Baa.
- Baa.
Baa.
- Baa.
Baa.
- Baa.
Baa.
- Baa.
The period of mourning is now over.
He's mad.
Enjoy yourself.
Take care.
Now the fun begins.
But... ah... are they going to enjoy it as well?
I don't know.
Should we ask them?
Longinus.
Ah, Longinus.
My financial wizard.
We have a question for you.
Who're the richest men in Rome?
Who?
Answer: The pimps.
Question number two.
Who are the most lascivious sluts in all of Rome?
Who?
Answer: The senators' wives.
So, an imperial brothel.
A most logical... way to balance the state budget.
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, we have gone to great expense...
...to bring you the finest flesh in our empire.
Five gold pieces.
Only five gold pieces for each and every twenty minutes.
And that's a bargain.
Look at them.
Aren't they beautiful?
The most lascivious ladies of the
Roman Empire have come today...
...to perform their patriotic duties for all.
For a mere five gold pieces.
So give, that they will remember you well.
Follow the road to the imperial bordello...
...and have your choice of the... finest flesh of the Empire.
Just five gold pieces for each and every twenty minutes.
And that's a bargain, because most of the... women here are respectable, married ladies.
Senators' wives.
Whores of blameless reputation.
I'll have to work out a special rate for you.
Greetings.
Flavia, come.
Don't waste time. Our senators' wives are not merely beautiful...
...like their husbands, they are insatiable.
And for only five gold pieces, to any one of you.
Enjoy the wives of those who govern you.
Take their wives, use them, abuse them.
Do as you will with them.
They are yours.
Just yours for only five...
Five gold pieces.
Hairy nipples.
Senator Marcellus.
Your wife will scare our customers away.
Try hot walnuts.
Hey, you over there.
Don't stint yourself.
The more that you give, the more they will like it.
Come and enjoy the skills perfected by our senators' ladies...
...while their husbands slept in the Senate?
Only five gold pieces.
Five.
Senators' wives...
...whores of blameless reputation.
He's making prostitutes of all our wives and daughters.
Humaliating the Senate and defending the army.
That's why the people love him.
Longinus, you're not having any fun.
Enjoy yourself.
What is your preference?
- Everything and nothing, Caesar.
You can't have both for the same price.
He's provoking you.
- Only me? Huh.
He's mad.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
He knows what he's doing perfectly well.
Give him enough rope... perhaps...
- He'll hang us all.
We also have a few very superior ladies here today.
You may lash them or may bind them.
Five gold pieces will buy you both.
Just five gold pieces.
Can't you stop bothering for just a few moments?
Chaerea.
I hear you have a taste for little boys.
Is that not so?
- No, Caesar. Big boys.
My soldiers.
- Are they ready?
Yes, Caesar.
Perfect.
We sail for Britain.
He will not go again.
We're only a few hours march
 from Rome.
And what new madness is this?
Mars tells me we will enjoy a great victory.
Ah, Chaerea.
- Caesar?
Are we prepared for the invasion?
Yes, Caesar...
...only...
Only what?
Where is Britain?
- Where?
There.
Ah, yes, lord, there.
But, eh... there is no enemy.
There is papyrus cane.
Papyrus cane, Divine Caesar?
- Yes, papyrus.
Don't be so stupid, Chaerea.
Order my army to attack and destroy that papyrus.
Yes, lord.
After all, we must have some proof that I conquered Britain.
War !
Kill !
While all of you were living safely here in Rome...
...your beloved emperor was risking his life...
...to preserve and enlarge the Empire.
I've heard rumors that the Senate... doesn't believe that I ever went to Britain.
No. No, lord.
But I did conquer Britain, and I have a hundred... thousand papyrus canes to prove it.
Hail, Caligula Caesar.
- Hail, Caesar.
Hail, Caligula, Conqueror.
- Hail. Hail. Hail.
Better be careful, he's in a strange mood tonight.
Caligula.
They hate you now.
Let them hate me.
So long as they fear me.
They are senators and consuls.
They are important men.
So important that they approve all I do?
They must be mad.
I don't know what else to do to provoke them.
Great victory.
In Britain.
And now...
...the bounties captured during this great campaign.
Fish.
Mullet, herring and salmon.
Oysters...
...and beautiful pink pearls.
From the blue seas and silver rivers of Britain.
Gained from the green forests and golden ponds of Britain.
Wild pheasants, plump geese.
Cowards!
Shit!
Crawl. Crawl. Crawl.
I hate them.
Almighty Caesar says...
...to balance the state budget...
...we shall confiscate the entire estates... of all those who have failed Rome.
Read out your list, Longinus.
Senators Galba,
Aponius, Marcellus,
Antonius, Cassius...
Chaerea.
They have failed me.
Arrest them.
...Lepidus...
...Sextus and Octavius.
Guards. Arrest them.
Almighty Caesar says...
...finish your dinner.
Eat.
It must be done soon.
Watch Chaerea.
- Why?
The omens are not good.
Be on your guard.
I think he intends to kill me.
What is amusing, Caesar?
Just a thought.
May I ask what thought?
Is it true that there is a conspiracy against me, Longinus?
Eh... well, lord... that is... I mean...
It seems there is a secret plot.
A plot is always a secret,
If it's not a secret, its's not a plot, but a plan.
That is logical, is it not, Claudius?
Even a half-wit can know that and you're a half-wit.
Half of me is, Caesar.
The situation's gone too far.
He's muffed the guards, overruled the... government and insulted the best friends of Rome.
Yes, the Senate counts for nothing anymore.
No one is safe from him.
He's a tyrant.
- Then what can we do?
There's only one solution.
If Caligula were to die...
- It could happen.
You need sleep.
I think I shall have to resign myself to living forever.
I hope you do.
I am going bald.
No, you're not.
You've never been able to face the facts, have you?
The facts? Yes, my lord.
Can you?
I need some sleep.
I need you.
Psst. Are you ready?
Will you speak your line, sister Isis?
Long have I wandered in the land of men...
...in search of you, brother Osiris.
I have been killed and cut into bits.
You put my pieces together, bringing back life...
...with a kiss.
There goes our blood.
It doesn't matter.
It's only a show.
I can't get it right.
- No, Caesar, not like that.
Hello, precious.
Have you been a good girl?
Don't you think she looks beautiful in my costume?
She's even wearing my little boots.
- Like her father.
My little... boots.
She's serious.
Going to be dressed like you today.
Password?
Scrotum.
So be it.
I...
...live...
...live.
Guards.
Hail, Claudius Caesar.
Hail, Claudius Caesar.
- Hail, Claudius.
Hail, Claudius.
- Claudius, hail.
Hail, Claudius Caesar.
Hail.
SUBTITLES CORRECTED: ASIFAKHEIR
Is that him?
Yes.
Oliver!
[ECHOES]
God be with you, Oliver.
And you too, John.
This is Henry Ireton, a good friend.
Good day to you, sir.
Mr. lreton. l've just been taking a last look at my land.
We had heard you were leaving, Mr. Cromwell.
We came from London directly.
You could have saved yourself the effort, Mr. lreton.
If we could discuss it,
Oliver, I'm sure--
There is nothing to discuss, John.
Well, come back to my house.
You've got a long journey back.
You must forgive the manner of our table, Mr. Pym.
Our best crockery is packed for the voyage.
Bridget, fetch the bread.
Yes, Mother.
We had hoped to persuade your husband to change his mind about going to America, ma'am. l should have thought you would know Oliver better than that, Mr. Pym. lt was not an easy decision, John.
This is my country, my land. God has been good to me here.
Then, sir, why are you leaving? l have a family, Mr. lreton. l owe it to my sons to make a better life for them.
England is no longer a country for a young man. l recall you often spoke out strongly in
Parliament for the rights and privileges of the common people.
Ah.
That was a long time ago, Mr. lreton.
I had a vision then.
A great nation.
Prosperous, God-fearing, good laws, strong, respected throughout the world.
That was the England
I dreamed of.
Well, sir, you are a squire now, a man of property.
Perhaps you no longer care for the common people.
Perhaps I've been misinformed, sir. l thought, as a Puritan, you would see it as your God-given duty to do the Lord's work in this land, regardless of sacrifice.
Mr. lreton, l was fighting for the liberty of the common people when you were in knee breeches.
Then why are you leaving? l am leaving because this country crawls with greed and corruption.
It is governed by adventurers and profiteers who think more of their pockets than their principles. l am leaving, sir, because we have a king who taxes the rich beyond its means and steals land from the poor to maintain his lavish court and his Catholic wife.
Now, when Parliament objected against these injustices he closed his Parliament down.
And our man dare not speak his mind for fear of imprisonment.
Oh, yes.
All my life l believed it was God's work to fight against such tyranny.
But God has turned his back upon this nation, and we are leaving it.
And what if Parliament should be recalled,
Mr. Cromwell?
And why should a king do that?
He needs money, Oliver.
What? To build another palace?
No.
To fight a war.
A war, John?
A war against whom?
The Scots have assembled and army on our border.
They may invade us at any moment.
The king needs money to raise an army.
Ah.
By the king's own decree,
Parliament has not sat these past 1 2 years.
And now the king needs money.
Once Parliament has assembled, it will lie within our power to change the whole structure of government in this country.
John, how many times did we sit in Parliament in the old days and how many resolutions did we pass?
And how many times did this king overrule us?
Oh, the king can have his war with Scotland.
We will be in America.
There will be a war, Mr. Cromwell, but it will not be with Scotland.
Henry.
With whom, Mr. Ireton?
Henry, we have argued this matter many times.
I'm convinced of it.
A war against whom, Mr. lreton?
Against the king, sir.
The king?
You mean a civil war?
In England?
[CHUCKLES]
You know not the ways of this nation, Mr. lreton.
Such things do not happen here.
And in my opinion, it is long overdue. l will not have such talk in my house.
It is common enough talk these days, I fear.
Then it is treasonable talk!
And I will not have it in my house! l mark the time when you were much against the king and never feared to say so.
In truth, there is much in this king that does offend me.
Yet, with all, I would not take up arms against him, and I would oppose any move to do so. ln such a cause, our swords will be in God's hands.
It's an odd thing, Mr. Ireton.
Every man who wages war believes God is on his side. l warrant God should often wonder who is on his. Good evening, sir.
Well, if I did give you offence, sir, I beg your pardon.
You're a young man, Mr. lreton. lt's fitting a young man should want to change the world.
Not the world, sir.
Only England.
With a civil war.
Good evening, Mrs. Cromwell.
Good evening, Mr. lreton.
I'll get your cloak,
Mr. Ireton.
I hope you'll forgive him.
Goodbye, John.
God be with you, Oliver.
[YELLlNG]
[COWS MOOlNG]
You've no right to do this.
Leave them animals be.
This is the common land.
[GRUNTING]
Any man who raises a hand against the king's men will be arrested.
You have no right to do this.
This land is ours.
Well, now it belongs to the Earl of Manchester.
By whose authority?
By the authority of the king.
Then l say the king is a thief!
You're under arrest.
Take him away!
Bastards!
Look at him, now. What's he done?
He's done nothing.
Release that man!
Who the devil are you?
This man works for me.
Whatever he has done, l will take full responsibility.
He has spoken treason against the king. Will you take responsibility for that?
The rights to pasture belong to the common people.
By what authority,
Lord Manchester, do you take that away?
By the authority of His Majesty's commissioners, granting me and my friends full rights to this land for the purpose of improvement.
Such a contract cannot be legal. lt is in violation of the law of this land.
As a magistrate, you should know the king is the law of this land.
On the contrary, my Lord
Manchester. lt is the king's duty to maintain the law.
This is common land. lt belongs to the people.
This is my land, and you are trespassing.
It's only out of respect for your rank I don't have you arrested for obstructing the law.
Captain Lundsford!
My lord?
See that no unauthorized person enters this area.
Yes, my lord.
Remove these people.
[CHATTERING]
[CHURCH BELL RINGING]
MAN: Good morrow to you, squire.
Good morrow, Mrs. Cromwell.
Squire, have you news of my husband?
It's in God's hands,
Mrs. Carter.
And in the king's.
Aye.
PRlEST:
Let us pray.
Almighty God, look down upon this thy house and we, thy humble servants.
Grant us the spirit of thy grace through
Jesus Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
Who has done this?
Answer me. Who has done this?
An edict, squire, from the archbishop himself and by order of the king.
By order of the king.
Is the Church of England not a Protestant church?
Would the king turn the house of God into a Roman temple?
Mr. Cromwell, l beseech you.
Does the king think that God can be bought with gold, trinkets and gilded rubbish? l know only that l have been instructed.
Has this king forgotten the Reformation?
[CRASHING]
Mr. Cromwell--
Away with it.
Popish idolatry!
[CLATTERING]
Did the Lord not say unto Moses:
"Thou shalt not make unto thyself any graven image nor bow down to them''?
Has this king forgotten the Spanish lnquisition? ls the Roman Catholic Church to have a seat in Westminster?
[SCREAMS]
Oh, my God.
My God.
Oh, my God!
Goddamn this king.
MAN:
King's guard, attention!
Here we are, my lord.
[GRUNTS]
That'll do, damn it. l'm not a damned cripple.
Me sticks, where are me sticks? Come over here, boy.
BO Y: Here they are, my lord.
Give me the damned things.
And who the devil are you?
Edward Hyde.
Ah.
Let's in to His Majesty.
Where is he?
He's at prayers, my lord.
Aye.
He might do well to pray and all.
We're gonna need some help.
First the lrish and now the Scots.
You doesn't turn your back on either of them.
Let us give thanks to our mighty God, that he has seen fit to bless this table with the fruits of his bounty.
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ, amen.
Amen.
I did remark, madam, with some distress that His Highness,
Prince Charles, was absent from prayers this morning.
He was with me, my lord.
He did pray with you?
In your chapel?
Yes, my lord. l am most displeased. lt is not fitting that a future king of England should make his devotions in a Catholic chapel.
Your private beliefs are respected.
But this is a Protestant country and as head of both church and state, it is my God-given duty to see that it so remains.
His Highness found the whole business so boring, my lord, that he fell asleep.
Didn't you, Charles?
Yes, madam.
I believe you will find your church as solid as ever, my lord.
Nevertheless, you will kindly see that it does not happen again.
Yes, my lord.
Your Majesty, the Earl of Strafford awaits your pleasure.
My good Lord Strafford, welcome back to England.
Thank you, my lord.
Your Majesty.
Your Royal Highness.
Most noble sovereign.
A chair for his lordship.
Thank you, my lord.
I'm sorry to see you in pain. lt is the agues from the bogs of lreland, my lord. Godforsaken place.
Saving your presence, my lord bishop.
We would not have summoned you, Lord Strafford, had the situation here not been of a greatest urgency.
You've doubtless heard that the Scottish rebels are marching on Newcastle?
Aye, my lord.
You will whip these barbarians to their senses.
But what of lreland, my lord?
We'll deal with lreland in good time.
You'll march an army on Scotland.
Army. What army?
Most of your army lies rotting beneath the bogs of Ireland.
What's left of it is hard-pressed to keep law and order.
Then we will raise a second army.
I fear Your Majesty may find that easier said than done.
What? l guarantee l could raise 3000 men under arms inside a month!
But could you guarantee their loyalty, my lord?
Is there an Englishman living who wouldn't draw a sword against his king's enemies?
There would be many
Englishmen, my Lord Strafford, who would more readily draw swords against the king.
My God, who is this jackanapes that mouths such treason in your presence, my lord?
You've been away a long time, Strafford.
Much here has changed.
Aye, I can see it has. l fear Sir Edward but speaks the truth.
To put an effective army in the field against the Scots will cost almost a million pounds.
The Crown does not have a million pounds.
Are we just going to sit here then and do nothing?
Then l will summon
Parliament and instruct them to provide money.
Parliament?!
The king of England go cap in hand to the common people, like a--?
A beggar.
Aye! A beggar? l have no choice. l say take the money.
You, my lord, are absolved before God and before man from any such action.
For in extreme necessity, the king is acquitted from all rule of government and can do all that his power permits.
Power? Where is the power of a king without an army? l'll warrant you, l'll raise an army.
We'll reduce this kingdom to submission in one summer!
Do you mean, sir, that l should declare war on my own people?
Aye!
Before they declare war on you.
Well, sons, there it is.
Parliament House.
Upon that place rests all the hopes of this nation for a settlement of its ills in peace.
Do you think it could come to war, Father?
Well, Oliver, when men run out of words, they reach for their swords.
Let's hope we can keep them talking.
MAN: The king demands money to raise an army.
[YELLING]
MAN: This House demands redress for grievances.
Grievances which the past
12 years have laid heavy upon the nation. l say that--
Might l be heard? l say, therefore, this House is resolved that we'll vote...
Welcome back to Parliament.
...no money for the king!
Order! Order!
Neither will we take up arms against our Scottish brethren, unless...
Unless this Parliament is allowed to function as the true voice of the people of England.
And not as a gathering of lackeys to the king.
[CHEERING]
Sir Edward Hyde,
Your Majesty.
Well, Sir Edward?
Your Majesty. l believe the House will grant a loan to the Crown.
But only on certain conditions.
Conditions?
What do you mean, conditions?
What are these conditions,
Sir Edward?
In essence, sire, that the Crown relinquishes all authority over Parliament.
And who put forward this proposal?
John Pym, Henry Ireton,
John Hampden.
The Puritans.
They were well supported, my lord.
And they call themselves Englishmen?
My God, it's enough to make a man deny his birthright.
Yet, withal, they still be Englishmen.
They make a mockery of the Crown!
They abuse the privilege of free speech with sedition and treason.
You're too loud,
Lord Strafford. lt is most unpleasant to the ear.
So it has come to this, my lord.
That you now bargain for your Crown.
What would you have me do?
Arrest every man who opposes me?
Hang them?
Would you rather make a gift of the Crown of England to the rabble in the street? lt lies beyond my power to arrest a citizen without proper charges.
Charges are immaterial.
Such an act would subvert the fundamental laws of this land, madam.
Such an act might save the Crown of England, my lord. l've governed this country justly and fairly these 12 years without reference to any Parliament.
You may be assured, l do not intend now to be schooled in my high office by illiterate farm hands, cobblers and basket weavers.
My Lord Strafford, you will rid us of these troublemakers:
Pym, Ireton, all of them. l'll arrest every one of them, my lord.
As you will. l shall need a warrant.
That is imperative.
And what will the charges be, my lord?
You're an experienced officer of the Crown, Strafford.
You do not need to be instructed by me.
Mr. Speaker.
May l have permission to address the House?
SPEAKER: By all means, sir.
Gentlemen.
A matter has come to my notice, which is of deep concern to me and will, l am sure, be to every single member of this House.
The Earl of Strafford has, this day, put his hand to a warrant for the arrest and impeachment of myself and four other honourable members of this House upon a charge of high treason.
[YELLING]
Though Strafford's hand be upon this warrant, l see in this business, not the hand of Strafford, but that of the king.
My lords! l beseech you, do not condemn this king too hastily.
For l am persuaded he has been ill-advised upon this course.
Is not a king to be judged by those from whom he seeks counsel?
He is not! lt is not the function of this House to sit in judgement upon this king.
The fault lies with those very people from whom the king has sought counsel. l therefore move that this House demands the arrest and impeachment of the Earl of Strafford upon a charge of high treason against the people of this nation.
Silence! Order!
The motion has been proposed.
Let it be put now to the question.
Is the motion agreed?
MEN: No!
In favour of the motion?
MEN:
Aye! Aye! Aye!
The ayes have it. l think my Lord
Strafford's condition will soon be far happier than mine.
[PRAYING IN FRENCH]
Do you see, madam?
Do you see now what you've made me do?
[CONTINUES PRAYING]
Gentlemen, His Majesty.
Pray be seated.
Your coming is nothing if not timely.
My Lord Strafford's head has but barely fallen.
Now, gentlemen, it is for you to speak.
Your Majesty, you see here the leaders of all parties of the House.
And though we be divided on many issues, we are of one accord. ln that we place above all else, our allegiance and loyalty to our most gracious sovereign.
For which reason we are deeply anxious for a settlement of the differences between us.
I share your sentiment,
Sir Edward.
The issue be this, my lord.
Parliament is persuaded that without the right to govern this nation by the will of the people and with God's guidance, we be not a Parliament at all.
And that unless some constitutional reformation be brought about, we would as well go back to our homes and our farms as pursue this mockery of a government one more day.
In short, Mr. Pym, you're asking me to relinquish my sovereign power over Parliament.
It does amount to that,
Your Majesty. l do swear that l hold this England and its laws dearer to my heart than any here.
But gentlemen, if you were to reduce me to a figurehead, a puppet king manipulated by Parliament, how then would I serve my country?
What manner of king would l be?
I am persuaded,
Your Majesty, that England must move forward to a more enlightened form of government based upon a true representation of a free people.
Such an institution is known as democracy, sir.
A democracy, Mr...?
Cromwell, sir.
Democracy, Mr. Cromwell, was a Greek drollery based on the foolish notion that there are extraordinary possibilities in very ordinary people. lt is the ordinary people, my lord, who would most readily lay down their lives in defence of your realm. lt is simply that being ordinary, they would prefer to be asked and not told.
You know, as l do, that even as we sit here, the Scots rebels are invading this land and not an English sword is raised against them. l beg you, therefore, let us bury our differences in defence of both our church and kingdom.
The Scots invade our land and all is urgency and alarm. ln the past 12 months our lrish colonists have been slaughtered, our churches desecrated, our clergy persecuted.
The Crown has been oddly reluctant to defend our church and kingdom over there, sir.
By my guard, l would as soon take up arms against Rome than against the Scots.
Would you have me declare war on the entire Catholic world, Mr. Cromwell? lt is your duty to defend our church, sir.
We are speaking now of a matter of international policy. ls Your Majesty sure that it's not a matter of domestic expediency?
Come, sir! l would remind you, sir, that you are addressing your king.
Mr. Cromwell, you are impertinent.
Such issues are beyond good manners, sir.
Catholicism is more than a religion, it is a political power.
Therefore, l am led to believe there will be no peace in lreland until the Catholic Church is crushed.
Your Majesty.
CHARLES: These gentlemen are from the Parliament.
Your Majesty,
Parliament has drawn up this document in which are set out our main grievances. lt is our belief that the demands made here are only those that are just and lawful and in the best interests of both Crown and kingdom.
I shall examine these proposals most carefully, Mr. Pym.
Gentlemen.
It is not too late, my lord.
You have the power still.
And with God's help, the strength to use that power.
Oh, my dearest Charles.
I married you as a king and as a man. l beseech you, do not disappoint me in either aspect.
''This House has time and again expressed its wholehearted loyalty to the Crown.
Yet... doth Parliament await in vain for a gesture..."
The king is coming with a warrant to arrest you,
John Hampden, Henry lreton,
Sir Arthur Haselrig and Oliver Cromwell under charge of high treason. l suggest you leave immediately.
''--that if the issues that divide the king from his country be not soon resolved, then these issues may soon divide the nation."
[CHEERING]
The king is coming with a warrant for our arrest.
What?
We must leave at once.
Oliver, your name is on it.
Come!
My lords! My lords!
Gentlemen! The king comes.
He comes with 100 men-at-arms.
The doors! The doors!
Bolt the doors!
Stand aside, gentlemen, if you please.
MAN: Halt!
Open in the name of the king!
Mr. Speaker.
Gentlemen, you must pardon this infringement of your privilege but I will not detain you long.
Mr. Speaker, I must make bold with your chair. l have here a warrant for the arrest of five members of this House.
John Pym, Henry Ireton,
John Hampden,
Oliver Cromwell and Sir Arthur Haselrig upon a charge of treason.
I see that the birds have flown.
Mr. Speaker, where are these gentlemen?
May it please
Your Majesty,
I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak except as this House gives me leave.
Well, sir, l have eyes. l see that one of them is here.
Captain.
CAPTAIN:
Take him!
Any action against a member of this House is a breach of privilege.
I move this House declares as public enemies any who lay hands upon its members.
And I further move... l further move that any such action against this House be considered a crime against the people and treason against this nation.
[CHEERING]
So be it.
Mr. Speaker, you will inform the members of this House that their presence is no longer required by the nation.
This Parliament is, by my authority, terminated, dissolved.
Your Majesty!
Are you aware that by your action in this House today you may have pushed this nation to the brink of civil war?
Now do we see in what contempt this king holds this
House and this nation?
It be either your king or your Parliament.
Honourable members, the decision is yours.
But l beseech you, in the name of God, think well on it.
Fairfax.
Gentlemen.
I move that this House demand the control of the militia and that this country be put in an immediate posture of defence.
Mr. Speaker.
My lords.
Honourable members.
This nation is now in a state of civil war.
And let us pray that God in his mercy will give us strength in this terrible and most unhappy hour.

You must get one and wear it. lt's a mark of your rank, captain.
Yes.

Hallelujah, hallelujah, brethren. lt is the Lord's work we do this day!
The Lord's work--
This is no place for you, Hugh, though you be welcome.
I've consulted God on this matter,
Mr. Cromwell. l asked him,
"Lord, whose side are you on?"
And he answered me, saying, ''On the side of truth and justice.''
So here I am.

LORDS: Your Highness.
And good Cousin Charles, most noble Prince of Wales.
How fare you, young sir? l am well, thank you, cousin.
So let us to action.

Morning, Cromwell.
Morning, my lord.
Your men fit, colonel?
My men are ready, my lord.
You seem damned eager to get into this business,
Cromwell.
We all enter this reluctantly, but the die is cast.
Is that not so, Lord Essex?
You are right.
Well, to your position.
Let no man move except upon my signal.
And may God look kindly upon us this day.
Amen to that.
Missed my breakfast.
Damned tricky things, stomachs.
God be with you, men.
MEN: God bless you.

Take care of yourself,
William.
The Lord'll take care of me, squire.
Have faith, John.
I have, squire. Come on, lads.
Look to your muskets.
Have your muskets at the ready. Come on, now.
Father.
May God take care of you, Richard and be with you, Oliver.
And with you too, Father.
HUGH: ''O Lord, defend our cause against the face of the enemy.
Save us from the violence of the enemy. O Lord of hope, fight for us that we may glorify thee."
O Lord, God of mercy.
Put thy strength in our hands this day.
Give not the battle to the strong, but to the righteous.
And be thou, O merciful God, our saviour and mighty deliverer.
Defend me from them that rise up against me. ln the name of Jesus Christ.
Amen.

[SHEEP CRYING]
Come, cousin.
Let's take a good look at these Roundheads.
Your Majesty.
God's teeth, have we not parleyed enough these past months?
Well, Essex, are you prepared?
We are. Shall we begin at 10?
Make it 9, my lord. l'm positively starving.
Then in God's name, let's to it. lt is agreed then, 9:00.
And by my faith, which l have not,
I swear that within the hour, this field will be strewn with English dead.
If this be so, they will have been killed by Englishmen.
For we have not seen fit to import foreign mercenaries into our ranks.
I will mark you well for that insult, sir.
Be on your guard!

We're waiting for the appointed time.
The appointed time?
Colonel Hampden, commence firing!

What the devil is that fool doing?
Artillery, commence firing!

Colonel, you've countermined my orders once today. You'll do as you're told, sir.

Hold your ground!
Well, Uncle, did you ever see a quarry so swiftly put to flight?
The king will forever keep this field and this day's service in grateful remembrance.
[MEN CHEERING]
[HORSE NEIGHING]
Come nightfall, we shall bury our dead.
And then, by God, we shall bury this army.
With such pitiful men in our ranks, it were better this war were never fought.
Not a drop of English blood soiled this English land. lt's a bad officer who blames his men, Cromwell.
I blame them not, my lord, for they are simple men.
But what match are farmer's boys against gentlemen's sons?
The battle is not yet lost, Cromwell.
This battle were lost before it began, my lord.
And in like manner, so will this war. ln the morning, l'm returning to Cambridge.
If you desert the field,
I'll have you arrested.
This war will not be won with untrained ploughmen, apprentices, old, decaying serving men.
We need men with fire in their bowels who fear the Lord, but not the enemy!
As God is my witness, l am resolved that this battle will be won.
Therefore, it's my intention to return to Cambridge, and raise an army of handpicked men, the like of which this nation has never seen!
With or without your permission, my Lord Manchester.
[MEN YELLING]
[CLANKING]
Bristol will not be permitted to fall. lt is our only seaport in the west, and if General Goring is incapable of holding it, then I will dispatch someone who can. l've a mind to see Bristol, my lord. lt is a fair city, l hear.
Then I shall place Bristol in your command, nephew. Now, my lord general, should our forces--
Your Majesty.
Yes, what is it?
News of Cromwell's army,
Your Majesty.
Come forward.
At last, Old lronsides ventures forth.
Well, speak, man.
They're about six miles away, Your Majesty.
Just south of Naseby.
By my reckoning, there be about 1000 horse and 2000 afoot.
And what news of Manchester's army? l saw no other army, Your Majesty.
Was not Cromwell to join Manchester's forces at Naseby?
That was our intelligence,
Your Majesty.
Then Manchester be still in Lincoln.
So Cromwell comes with his army of 3000 to our 7000.
By your leave, Uncle. Your Highness.
General Astley, sound the alert. l want every man in full battle order at once.
[BUGLE SOUNDS]
By God, we have him!
Manchester!
[ECHOING]
Where in the name of Christ is he?
Know you not we are at war? ln God's name l do swear we fight this war single-handed.
Oliver.
What bloody treachery is this?
We came to meet
Manchester and instead we find the king's army.
Well, I shall take on the king.
And after that if needs must, l'll take on Manchester as well!
Before you stands the enemy, his three to every one of us.
And where, in God's name, is Manchester?
My Lord Manchester will rue the day he has not joined us here.
And now to your positions.
These tactics we have practiced often enough these past six months now let us put them to the test.
For upon this field of Naseby, we'll turn the tide of this unhappy war.
God be with you all. ls this wise, Oliver?
We're heavily outnumbered.
Was not Gideon outnumbered by the Amalekites?
It is not numbers that count, but speed and surprise.
Let no man move, except upon the word of his commander!
Though we be outnumbered, we shall win this battle!
I promise you!
So now put your faith in God and keep your powder dry.

[CHATTERING]
MAN:
Who goes there?
RlCHARD:
Captain Cromwell, 3rd Cavalry.
Richard.
Thanks be to God.
Where is Oliver?
The outrageous incompetence and inefficiency of the high command have tried my patience and that of my hard-pressed army long enough.
By my faith, l swear it would be better that those gallant generals
Essex and Manchester, took up swords with the king.
For then might we be assured of victory.
MEN:
Hear, hear.
For by their reluctance to pursue this war with the intensity it demands, they have proved treacherous both to our cause and to this nation.
MEN:
Hear, hear.
If we beat the king 99 times, he will still be our king and we his subjects.
If he beats us but once, we shall all be hanged. lf that is so, then why in the bowels of Christ did we take up arms against him in the first place?
Gentlemen, honest men have served us faithfully and many have died that this House may sit in freedom and this nation live in liberty.
In the name of God,
I beseech you, do not desert them now.
Unless Parliament supports this war to the full, l am bound to say, in all conscience, that l will lay down my sword and let this House make its peace with the king, be that peace ever so base.
[MEN YELLING]
Then, it is for this House to decide. l move that this
House demands the immediate resignation of the high command upon the grounds that they be no longer competent to command the armed forces of this Parliament.
Order. Order. Order!
The motion has been proposed.
Let it now be put to the question.
Those against Cromwell's motion.
MEN: No!
Those in favour of the motion.
MEN: Aye!
The ayes have it.
The motion be carried.
I move... l move that Colonel
Cromwell be appointed commander in chief of the army.
MEN:
Yeah!
Bristol. We must dispatch aid to Bristol with all possible speed, for as long as Rupert holds
Bristol, this war be not lost.
General Digby, if you can detach your forces in this area and approach Bristol from the east--
To do that, my lord, would be to expose this city to immediate attack.
Then we move the
Marquis of Huntly's army southward.
The marquis, my lord, surrendered to Cromwell's forces yesterday.
Cromwell. I hear nothing but Cromwell, Cromwell.
My lord, it is but a game we play here, a game with wooden armies and paper flags.
'Tis but a block of wood you hold in your hand.
My lords, all l ask for is a little time.
Time, my lord, costs us heavily. lf we can hold on here in Oxford for six weeks, the Scots have promised an army of 20,000 men.
Her Majesty is in communication with my cousin, the king of France, and I have good reason to hope for support from Ireland.
An army from Ireland,
Your Majesty?
I would as soon join forces with Cromwell himself as take up arms with the Catholics!
I am the king and defender of my people and l maintain the right to seek relief from no matter what quarter.
As king, my lord, it is your God-given duty to defend the faith of this nation.
I do what I think to be right, sir.
Catholics as allies! lt is unthinkable!
My God, if it has come to this, let us rather sue for an honourable peace than fight a dishonourable war.
I will not countenance defeat.
Rather than abandon my kingdom to Parliament,
I would come to terms with the devil himself.
Since you came to the throne, Your Majesty, your armies have persistently persecuted our Church in lreland.
And yet, now that your need is great, you turn to us for help.
The king's actions in lreland, Your Excellency, will seem as nothing should these Puritans come to power. lt is not only the Crown of England that is in peril, Excellency.
All institutions of established order throughout the countries of Europe are threatened.
An Irish army of 20,000 men, even 1 5,000, would forestall such a threat and bring this wretched war to a speedy end.
I am instructed to say that His Holiness would permit an lrish force to take up arms in this country.
But there are certain conditions.
First, the Catholic Church in Ireland must be completely restored and permitted to practice freely without interference or oppression.
Secondly, all Protestant churches in lreland must be closed and all Protestant bishops and ministers removed from office.
Oh, there are one or two other minor conditions of little consequence.
What you demand, Excellency, would be a betrayal of my coronation oath as head of the English Church.
You have a duty, Charles, to the Crown.
For without that, you will be head of nothing!
May I tell His Holiness that you will agree to these conditions?
You have something to say to me, Sir Edward?
Your Majesty, His Highness
Prince Rupert attends in the council chamber.
Rupert? Here in Oxford?
Yes, my lord.
I fear Bristol has fallen.
[ddd]
Your Excellency will excuse me.
Your Majesty.
My lords,
His Majesty.
Do you not rise, sir, when your king approaches?
Rise, sir! Or to your knees in shame.
You did give me your most solemn promise that you would hold Bristol for four months.
Yet you have not held it for four weeks!
You promised mountains, yet you perform molehills.
You make a knave of your king.
My lord, we were besieged on all sides.
Our men are foot-weary from battle, ailing with plague and sickness.
Yet you contrived to escape with your life.
I have brought you an army, my lord.
An army 2000 strong, ready and willing to fight on for their king! ln exchange for all the corn and stores you held in Bristol and 200 cannon.
That was the price of your freedom, sir.
I did what I considered to be right!
You deserted your command, sir.
I made a military decision.
A decision that may have cost us this war.
Your action in this matter is of such affliction to me, sir, that it is the greatest trial that has yet befallen me.
My conclusion is to desire you to seek subsistence elsewhere, not in my kingdom.
Most gracious lord, l do not crave forgiveness, for by all as l hold most dear, l do solemnly swear that l acted only in good faith!
The matter is at an end.
I will hear no more.
My lord!
My lord, I beseech you. ln God's name, allow that l may die with honour.
Condemn me not to live.
Captain Lundsford.
Do not put upon these shoulders the terrible shame of exile and dishonour.
I beg you, take my life, most noble lord.
Good Uncle, for pity's sake!
His Highness is to be kept under close guard until such time as he is deported.
Very well, Your Majesty.
Father, Mother says
I'm to go with her tonight to France. ls that your wish, Father?
Yes.
My duty is to stay here with you and fight beside you.
Your place now is at your mother's side, Charles.
You will help her raise money, perhaps an army.
Should l meet my death, and you are safely in France, then England will still have, in you, a lawful king.
You will go with your mother.
I love this land.
And when this great responsibility becomes yours then l pray that with God's help, you will reign more happily than I have done.
Now go, with God's speed and your father's blessing.
Oh, Charles.
I love you.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Your Majesty, it is my most solemn duty to place you under arrest.
By whose command, sir?
By the command of Parliament, sir.
I know of no authority in England above that of the king. lt is upon that issue that this war was fought.
Whither am l to be taken?
To London, sir.
You must grant me a little time to--
We leave for London at once.
And my children, what of them?
We will take care of your children.
His Majesty will have all the time he requires.
As for your children, sir, you may take them with you.
I thank you, sir.

When did it happen?
This morning.
What is it?
John Pym is dead.
Parliament is discussing peace terms with the king.
Does the army have no say in this?
The army has been ordered to disband. ln God's name, did we fight this war that the politicians should take over behind our backs?!
If Parliament has decided the army will disband, then the army will disband. l say we take the army and march on Parliament.
The sword will not rule this land.
We fought to institute a parliamentary system and overthrow the very tyranny which you now propose.
And who is talking to the king? Parliament? l doubt it. l warrant l know who is doing all the talking.
I have these past three days been in consultation with
His Majesty the king.
And l am pleased to inform the House that the king is now prepared to discuss peace terms provided that the army stand down. l have given this House's assurance that his wishes will be complied with.
Further, in recognition of the very great debt this House owes its commander,
General Cromwell, it is proposed to award him a pension of 3000 pounds a year together with certain estates in the county of Cambridge.
[MEN APPLAUD]
It is further proposed that the sum of 2000 pounds--
Such low treachery is not worthy even of you, my Lord Manchester.
Am I to believe my ears?
Did this nation win a bloody civil war in order the king should dictate the terms of peace? l have already discussed the matter at great length with His Majesty--
You have discussed it? lt is a matter for this House to discuss.
MEN:
Hear, hear!
The king will not come to terms, sir, until the army stand down.
MEN:
Hear, hear.
And the army will not stand down until the king comes to terms.
So if the king will not talk to this House, then let the king talk to the army.
Out of the question.
The king would never agree.
Parliament is behind us, sir, and on this occasion, we have the majority.
Sir Thomas Fairfax.
MAN: He's bringing in the army!
SPEAKER: Order! Order!
Order, I say!
Order! Silence! Order!
Order!
Silence!
Order!
I believe, my Lord Manchester, that now I have the majority.
This is dictatorship. lt will mean a new civil war.
SPEAKER:
Order!
Honourable members, l swear before my God that you give me no alternative.
When those liberties for which this army and this nation have fought so hard are most solemnly guaranteed then this army will stand down.
And upon that, you have my most sacred promise.
[MEN CHATTERING]
[CHILDREN LAUGHING]
[BELLS RINGING IN DISTANCE]
[CHARLES LAUGHS]
And who have we here? lt is l, my lord.
You were supposed to have run, Sir Edward, not let me catch you. l'm afraid l'm getting a little too old for such games, my lord.
Cromwell is here to see you.
Oh.
You must play on your own now, children.
Your father has other games to play.
Prince Henry, you will be good enough to give me back my hat.
Sir.
Gentlemen,
His Majesty.
We came to present our terms, my lord.
If Your Majesty will be so kind as to study these proposals.
Has Parliament approved this treaty?
Parliament no longer truly represents the people of this nation, Sir Edward.
And you, Mr. Cromwell, do you truly represent the people of this nation?
I represent the army, sir, and the army is the heart and conscience of the people.
So having failed to come to terms with Parliament, you would now negotiate with the king. l am not bound to negotiate with anyone.
With 50,000 men under my command
I could impose a government on this nation overnight.
One is given to wondering,
Mr. Cromwell, why you do not do that.
I am deeply convinced, my lord, it be the duty of Parliament to frame a constitutional government, and not the army.
Then l do not see that you have any need of me at all.
On the contrary, sir.
An England without a king is unthinkable.
But withal, a king that can command respect a monarch who governs, not from fear, but by the affection of a free people.
Such a king could reunite this great nation of ours and make the name of England the noblest in all Christendom.
Should you adorn that inheritance, my lord, all Englishmen would be proud to call you king.
Mr. Cromwell, l do confess that l did greatly misjudge you, for l did mark you as an ambitious man.
To these ends, my lord,
I am ambitious.
Then you have my respect, sir.
Thank you, my lord.
We shall return in the morning, sir. l shall require a little longer to study this document.
Perhaps a week.
As Your Majesty pleases.
I sincerely hope that our future relations may be equally amiable, sir.
That is my hope also, my lord.
A cunning fellow. l believe him to be a sincere man, my lord.
Indeed.
If these proposals be acceptable, there never was a Crown so nearly lost, so easily recovered.
Whatever these proposals may be, Sir Edward, they are not acceptable to the king.
MAN: Cromwell has betrayed us!
CROWD: Aye!
We have given our blood and our lives in this war to put down this king! lf Cromwell comes to terms with him now, what price our freedom then?
Get back, will you?! l have served General
Cromwell faithfully all my life, and l reckoned him to be a man who feared God and did honour his word!
But in this business he has shown himself to be a man of no honour!
MEN:
Aye!
We fought this war to remove this king, not to put him back on the throne!
MEN: Aye! l say, let us march on London, let us take Parliament, and then let the king try to negotiate with us!
MAN:
Make way for Cromwell.
Traitors! Mutineers! l don't have to tell you, any of you, you could all be hanged for this.
We are not serfs, general, nor mercenaries.
We fought for the Lord in our cause, and now we have a right to speak.
You have no rights to preach revolt and mutiny.
As for you, John Carter, l did expect a greater degree of loyalty from you. l am still loyal to what l fought for, sir. Can the same be said of you? l have not betrayed my God, country, Parliament or my conscience.
Where was your conscience this day, when you parleyed with the king?
I tell you, all of you, l do most honestly believe that we have taught this king a lesson.
And he will prove most honourable.
Upon that I would stake my life.
Traitor! Traitor!
This is a military camp, sir, not a debating chamber.
Under military law, any man inciting mutiny can be hanged.
Colonel Harrison.
Yes, General.
These three men will draw lots. One of them will be hanged.
Captain Lancing, get a length of rope.
Yes, sir.
You, man.
Yes, sir.
Pick up some straws.
General, there is a Sir Edward Hyde to see you.
Sir Edward, has the king considered our terms?
The king, sir, has not even read your terms.
Nor, will l venture, has he any intention of so doing.
He has, this day, drawn up a secret treaty with
Manchester and Essex to raise a Scottish army against the Parliamentary forces.
He has already consented to a Catholic army from lreland.
While you negotiate a settlement with him, he is planning a second civil war. l do confess that l have these many years given my allegiance to a man not worthy of the title, king of England.
Colonel Harrison!
I will have this king's head..
Aye, and the Crown upon it.
This obstinate king, this man of blood, whose heart God has hardened, can no longer be trusted.
For in prodigious treason, he has revealed himself to be a traitor.
A man of no honour.
A man unfitted to bear the title, king of England.
MEN:
Hear, hear. l demand, therefore, in the name of the army and the people of this nation that Charles l, king of England, be brought hence to stand trial for his life on a charge of treason.
Oyez, oyez, oyez.
All manner of persons having anything to do with this court, come forward and give your attendance.
Every man to keep silence upon pain of imprisonment.
God save the king.
Let the prisoner be brought in.
[CHATTERING]
The clerk of arraigns will read the charges.
"Charles Stuart, king of England, you stand before this court charged with high treason. ln that being admitted king of England, and therein trusted with power to govern according to the laws, you did out of wickedness and design erect and uphold in yourself an unlimited and tyrannical power.
To rule at your will and overthrow the rights and liberties of the people.
And that you did traitorously and maliciously levy a cruel war against Parliament and the people.
And are therefore guilty of all the treasons, rapings, burnings, spoils, desolations, damages and mischiefs to the nation committed in the said war.
Thus, on behalf of the people of England, this court impeaches you as a tyrant, traitor, murderer and public enemy to the
Commonwealth of England."
God save the king!
JUDGE:
Silence!
Sir, you have heard the charges against you.
The court expects an answer.
First, l would know by what authority, l mean lawful authority, l am brought here and carried from place to place, and l know not what.
And by what authority you presume to sit in judgement on me.
Remember, l am your lawful king.
Think well upon it.
I have a trust committed to me by God, by old and lawful descent.
Therefore, let me know by what authority
I am brought here, and I shall answer.
It is not for the prisoner to question the court.
I am no ordinary prisoner, sir.
An answer, sir, the court demands an answer.
Then I refuse an answer.
Sir, you are before a court of justice.
Well, sir... l see that l am before a power.
[CHATTERING]
JUDGE:
The court will keep silent.
Mr. Solicitor General, are your witnesses prepared?
They are, my lord.
Then let them be brought forth.
Call Sir Edward Hyde.
And you saw the king and his wife alone in their chambers with this Catholic
Archbishop Rinuccini?
I did.
And what did you assume was the purpose of this meeting?
You are obliged to answer, Sir Edward.
To raise an Irish army, my lord.
To fight against the Parliamentary forces?
And at this time, was the king in communication with any other foreign power?
Yes. Yes, with the king of France and with the Dutch.
For the same purpose?
Yes.
To raise a foreign army to invade this country, and to perpetuate the war against the people of this kingdom.
Sir Edward?
Yes.
[CROWD YELLING]
To the block with him!
[GAVEL POUNDS]
Sir, throughout the three days of this hearing, this court has patiently awaited your pleasure to hear what you have to say in answer to the charges against you.
Yet you have declined to speak. l am most willing, sir, to answer before Parliament, but not before this assembly whose authority l refuse to acknowledge.
Sir, what answers you may offer the commons can be given here.
For this court does sit in the name of the House of Commons.
Sir, if, as you have said, you do love the liberty of the subject, you will grant me, your king, a hearing before Parliament, which is the lords and commons assembled.
Sir, l submit you seek only to delay the course of justice.
By your favour, sir, l seek only those rights which, as your king,
I would grant to any one of my subjects.
JUDGE:
Silence!
Sir, this court requires to know if you have anything to say before judgement is passed upon you.
I have nothing to say to you.
Then this court will retire to judgement.
What ails thee?
Art thou mad?
Have we come thus far that you would betray us now?
There is nothing in the Constitution of this land that entitles us to bring a king to trial. ls he not answerable to his subjects?
The trial is clearly illegal, and l will have-- ls not the king answerable to his subjects?
The king, sir, is answerable only to God.
Then, by God, when he dies, he shall have much to answer for.
We have gone too far in this matter.
This commission has no authority--
MAN 1 : Our authority lies with the Parliament, sir.
MAN 2:
Parliament is the law in this land. lf the charges against this king be not proven, what terrible retribution may he not bring down upon our heads?
In the name of God!
What are we all?
Men?
Cowering and quivering like downtrodden serfs.
The king is not England, and England is not the king! lt is not the survival of the king that is at issue here.
It is the survival of England.
And this king, by his dishonesties, by his treasons, and by his secret treaties with foreign powers, has shown himself to be ill-fitted to govern this great nation!
As God is my witness, Oliver,
I desire not the king's death, but the settlement of this nation in peace.
Do you think l don't desire that?
Go back to my farm and my family?
Very well. Go again to this king.
Offer him once more our terms.
Though God knows, he should be well acquainted with them by now.
Tell him he may sit upon his throne, but that this country will be governed by Parliament, and Parliament will be elected by the people.
Now, Sir Thomas, if you can achieve this where we have failed, this trial will end.
Here is a warrant demanding the death of the king upon the charge of high treason against this nation. lt will require all your signatures. Sir Thomas.
I have come thus far with you,
Oliver, in our great cause... but I will not sign this warrant.
Oliver, l cannot. ls he guilty or not guilty?
He is the king. ls he guilty?
Yes.
Sign it.
Charles Stuart, king of England... you have been found guilty of high treason against the good people of this nation represented in Parliament, by whose authority this court does sit in judgement upon you.
Upon this charge, it is the sentence of this court that you be taken hence to an... appointed place and put to death by the severing of the head from the body.
And that is the sentence of the whole court.
[CROWD YELLING]
Remove the prisoner.
MAN: Silence.
Will you hear me a word, sir?
No, sir, you are not to be heard after sentence.
By your favour, sir. l know as much law as any man here. l have the right to be heard.
No, sir. Guard!
Remove your prisoner!
I demand to be heard!
I am your lawful king!
MAN:
Blood for the traitor!
General.
Sir Thomas.
I have been this past night to the commissioners.
They have instructed me to lay before you this warrant for 40,000 pounds in return for the king's life.
How little you know me that you think you can buy my principles.
You insult me with that cheap bribe.
Will you not think on it? l have thought on it. And well.
By my God, l have thought on it.
PRIEST: ''Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall.
And they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe.
And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head.
And they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying, 'Hail, king of the Jews!'
And they spit--''
Your Majesty. ls it time?
No, Your Majesty.
Her Royal Highness, the Princess Elizabeth, and his Royal Highness,
Prince Henry.
Elizabeth, sweetheart.
Don't grieve for me.
Henry.
Now, both of you... mark what I say.
They will cut off thy father's head.
Shh, there now.
Henry, pay careful attention to what l say.
You must not let them make you king, not while your brother
Charles is still alive.
I would be torn to pieces first.
That's my son.
Today, your brother will be king.
Elizabeth, now.
It's a glorious death to which I go.
Tell your mother... that my love for her was the same to the last.
And remember me in your prayers.
The king's escort, Your Majesty.
Thank you.
God bless you both.
What kind of morning is it, colonel?
Indeed it is somewhat chilly, Your Majesty.
Then l was wise to put on a second shirt.
For if l trembled with the cold, my enemies would say it was from fear.
I would not expose myself to such a reproach.
Please keep them.
Oh, Your Majesty.
I do not fear death,
Sir Thomas. lt is not at all terrible to me. l thank my God l have prepared for it.
Are we to ride to
Westminster, or walk?
My orders are that we walk, Your Majesty.
Admirable. The morning air will do me good.
[BELL RlNGlNG]
[HORSE NElGHlNG]
MAN:
The king's coming.
He's coming now. The king's coming!
Hey, you. Stop him!
Gentlemen, the king comes.
MAN 1 : Traitor!
MAN 2: Execute him!
MAN 3: Execute him!
And a true, urgent sword in our hand.
God bless, Your Majesty.
God bless you.
Escort, halt!
[CROWD CHATTERING]
[CHATTERING STOPS]
Well, gentlemen, are you afraid to kill your king with an open face? l will not delay you long, but will say only this to you:
As God is my witness, l have forgiven those that have brought me here and pray that my death be not laid to their charge.
For I do endeavour, even to the last, to maintain the peace of my kingdom.
I go now from a corruptible to an incorruptible crown.
To everlasting peace.
Will that suffice?
Permit me, sir, that l may pray a while before the blow is struck.
Then when I put out my hands so:
That will be the sign.
Lord, let us now, thy servant, depart in peace according to thy word.
For mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people.
Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost.
As it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be.
Behold the head of a traitor!
[PEOPLE YELLING]
We did not assassinate.
Nor was this thing done in a corner, it was done in the face of God and of all men.
The office of king is now abolished.
Long live Parliament.
Long live the Republic.
MEN: Aye, long live the Republic.
Richard, l want to go back to Cambridge.
Will you come with me, son? lf you wish, Father. lt will be peace and quiet there now.
God knows, my soul craves a little peace.
You must not think on it, Oliver.
'Tis over now.
The war, everything.
'Tis over and done.
Oliver, you're home now.
There's nothing more to think on.
Save that we two may grow old together in peace.
Peace.
Father.
Henry lreton is at the house with some men from Parliament.
I'll be along shortly.
Tom.
Arthur.
Henry.
Well, you all seem solemn enough. lt is a solemn business that brings us here, Oliver.
Well, speak of it.
The country needs a head of state, Oliver. lt must be governed. ls it not governed by Parliament?
There must be a figurehead. lt is our tradition.
The country needs a king, Oliver.
God knows, you've said so many times yourself.
The country will be ruled by Parliament.
Now, in the name of Christ, how often must I say that?
And who will control Parliament?
The people, the people, the people! lt's not practical. lt won't work. lt will work and it must work.
We are here, on behalf of Parliament, to offer you the Crown.
To offer...
Me, king of England?
King Oliver I of England.
Elizabeth, tell me, do you see before you a king?
This tired, sickening man, this country oaf, crude in speech and manner?
This rough fellow, does he display the bearing of a king?
You are the one man who can govern this country.
In the name of God, did we cut the head off this king only to steal his Crown?
This hollow golden ring, this worthless trinket.
Give it to a whore for the price of her bed!
If you would find a head to fit it, let it adorn some court jester or some strolling player that he may play your king, but not l.
Power must be absolute, or it be no power at all. lt was not for power that we did this thing. Have you not understood that yet?
Now, Ireton, mark me, and mark me well.
That you be hard-set upon ambitious courses has not escaped me, and if you seek to use me towards such ends, though l love you like a brother, l swear, l will destroy you.
Every freeborn Englishman, be he the lowest of the lowest, is entitled to a voice in the governing of this country.
But there is no vote for the poor, for the underprivileged, no vote for all those who took up arms to put down the very autocracy that this Parliament now imposes upon us.
You did not vote this Parliament into office.
This gaggle of buffoons, these villains!
Much has been said in this House about the so-called inequity of certain members being financially involved in national projects.
Members have ascribed to this state of affairs dark and sinister motives.
I say if we in Parliament cannot gain from ruling the country, there's really very little point in our being here at all.
MAN: No member of this
House should be permitted to profit from his office.
MEN:
Hear! Hear!
MAN: lf this House knew its duty to the nation, it would terminate its sitting and let a new Parliament be elected.
SPEAKER: Order!
Gentlemen, l move that this House be given power to remain in office a further three years without re-election.
[CHEERING]
In my opinion, a committee of inquiry should be set up to investigate the financial involvement of certain members.
SPEAKER:
Order!
Mr. Speaker. May I have your permission to address this assembly?
By all means, sir.
My lords, honourable members, l have always desired, above my life, a free Parliament sitting by the authority of the good people of this nation.
A Parliament open and visible, to be seen by all men. lt is six years since l handed over to you this great responsibility in the hope that you would make good and wholesome laws which the people of this nation expected of you.
I must confess to some abatement of my hopes for what has happened in my absence.
Instead of uniting the good people of this nation with righteousness and peace, which would have been a glorious and Christian thing to have done, what do I find?
Anarchy, corruption, division and dissatisfaction.
I say that the enemies of this nation have flourished under your protection.
You were from the beginning a provisional government not truly representative of the people.
For have the people elected you?
Has this House gone once to the people it purports to represent?
No, it has not! And after six years of misgovernment, what do we find?
Sir Thomas Fairfax moves a bill to give this House a further lease of its worthless and dishonourable life!
Gentlemen, an immovable
Parliament is more obnoxious than an immovable king!
You are drunkards, tricksters, villains, whoremasters, godless, self-seeking, ambitious tricksters.
You are no more capable of conducting the affairs of this nation than you are of running a brothel!
[MEN YELL]
You are scum, sir, and not truly elected scum at that.
This is no Parliament.
I shall put an end to your sitting. l hereby declare this
Parliament dissolved!
Colonel Harrison!
Yes, sir. Troops forward!
Rubbish.
Remove them!
Come on, get them out.
This is dictatorship, sir! Dictatorship!
Dictator!
Dictatorship!
MAN: This is illegal!
Come, sir. l refuse to quit this chair.
By your leave, sir.
Away with this bauble!
I seem to recall that we cut off a king's head for such as this.
You are a traitor, sir. lt is the likes of you who have turned my hand to this. l have sought the Lord's guidance night and day in this matter. lt is not idly done, for this nation will be justly governed.
I will give this nation back its self-respect.
We will walk in this world with our heads held high. l will liberate man's souls from the darkness of ignorance. l will build schools and universities for all.
This will become the golden age of learning. l will bring the law within the reach of every common man.
There'll be work and bread for all.
This nation will prosper because it is a godly nation and because we walk hand in hand with the Lord.
I swear by the name of the living God that I will see this nation properly governed if I have to do it myself.
Dear God, give me the strength to do it... alone.
NARRATOR: Oliver Cromwell ruled the nation as lord protector for five years.
In that short time, he raised England to be a great power,
feared and respected throughout the world.
Under his hand were laid the foundations
of a truly democratic nation.
In 1658, he died.
Three years later, Charles, prince of Wales, was crowned king
and a monarch sat once more upon the throne of England.
But an England never to be the same again.

MIRROR
The road from the station passed through lgnatievo, then swerved near the farm we had lived on each summer before the war, and through a dense oak forest went on as far as Tomshino.
Usually we spotted our people as soon as they appeared from behind a bush in the mid-field.
If he turned from the bush towards our house, then it's father.
If not, it meant it was not father and that father would never come.
Am I going the right way to Tomshino?
You shouldn't have taken a turn at the bush.
- And this...What's this?..
- What?
Why are you sitting here?
- I live here.
- Where? On the fence?
Are you interested in the way to
Tomshino or where I live?
I brought all the instruments, but forgot the key.
Do you happen to have a nail or a screw-driver?
I don't have any nails.
Why are you so nervous?
Give me your hand. I'm a doctor.
You're bothering me.
Do you want me to call my husband?
You haven't got any husband.
There's no ring.
Though people don't wear rings nowadays. Maybe only old people.
May I have a cigarette?
Why do you look so sad?
And why do you look so happy?
It's a pleasure to fall down with an attractive woman.
You know, I fell and found strange things here - roots, bushes...
Has it ever occurred to you that plants can feel, know, even comprehend...
The trees, this hazel-nut bush...
- This is the alder-tree.
- It doesn't matter.
They don't run about.
Like us who are rushing, fussing, uttering banalities.
That's because we don't trust nature that is inside us.
Always this suspiciousness, haste, and no time to stop and think.
Look, you seem to be a bit...
It's no problem for me.
I'm a doctor.
And what about "Ward Number Six"?
Oh, Chekhov had made it all up!
Come to Tomshino sometime.
We often have a good time there.
You've got blood!
- Where?
- Behind your ear.
Each moment of our dates, not many,
We celebrated as an Epiphany.
Alone in the whole world.
More daring and lighter than a bird
Down the stairs, like a dizzy apparition,
You came to take me on your road,
Through rain-soaked lilacs,
To your own possession,
To the looking glass world.
As night descended
I was blessed with grace,
The altar gate opened up,
And in the darkness shining
And slowly reclining
Was your body naked.
On waking up I said:
God bless you!
Although I knew how daring and undue
My blessing was: You were fast asleep,
Your closed eyelids with the universal blue
The lilac on the table so strained to sweep.
Touched by the blue, your lids
Were quite serene, your hand was warm.
And rivers pulsed in crystal slits,
Mountains smoked, and oceans swarmed.
You held a sphere in your palm,
Of crystal; on your throne you were sleeping calm.
And, oh my God! -
Belonging only to me,
You woke and at once transformed
The language humans speak and think.
Speech rushed up sonorously formed,
With the word "you" so much reformed
As to evolve a new sense meaning king.
And suddenly all changed, like in a trance,
Even trivial things, so often used and tried,
When standing 'tween us, guarding us,
Was water, solid, stratified.
It carried us I don't know where.
Retreating before us, like some mirage,
Were cities, miraculously fair.
Under our feet the mint grass spread,
The birds were following our tread,
The fishes came to a river bend,
And to our eyes the sky was open.
Behind us our fate was groping,
Like an insane man with a razor in his hand.
Oh, good heavens! Dounya!
What is it, Pasha?!
A fire! But be quiet.
He'll get it coming to him!
And what ifVitya is in there?
What if he's burned?
Where's Klanya?
What?
Dad!
- Alexei?
- Hello, ma!
What's wrong with your voice?
Nothing serious.
I guess it's just a sore throat.
I haven't spoken to anyone for three days.
I even liked it. I think it's good to keep silent for a while.
Words can't express everything a person feels.
Words are flaccid.
I just dreamed ofyou in my sleep.
As though I were still a child...
By the way, what year was it when dad left us?
1935. Why?
And the fire? Remember the hay-loft that burned down at the farm?
That was in '35 too.
All right, stop pulling the wool over my eyes.
You know... Lisa died.
The one I worked in the printing house with.
- Oh God... When?
- This morning, at 7.
And what time is it now?
What is now?
- Almost six.
- In the morning?
What's the matter with you? ln the evening.
Mom, why do we have to fight all the time?
I'm sorry if I did anything wrong.
Printing-house.
Next stop: Serpukhovskaya.
What's the rush?
Hello.
Where're the proofs
I've been reading?
I don't know. Just a minute.
Yelizaveta Pavlovna is here.
Marousia, what's wrong?
Something in yesterday's proofs?
In the Goslit edition?
Don't be so nervous!
We should look in the typesetting case.
Nothing terrible has happened.
It's such an important edition!
Although misprints have no place in any edition.
Shut up, you idiot.
- What happened?
- Nothing serious.
I just want to check something.
I may be wrong...
Let's start from the beginning.
I'd rather do it myself.
Everybody's rushing, no one's got any time!
You think I'm afraid?
No, let other people be afraid.
Some people should work, and others should be afraid.
Well, nothing awful has happened.
If it happened, it happened.
We've been printing all night...
I waited for you since yesterday's morning.
That you won't come they probably guessed.
Remember what a beautiful weather it was?
A holiday weather!
And I walked coatless.
Today you're here, and they have arranged
An utterly gloomy and cloudy day,
It rains, and it's getting unusually late,
The rain drops run down the cold terrain,
Unsoothable by word, unwipable by hand...
You see, it wasn't there, was it?
Everything is all right.
It wasn't...
That would've been a horrid mistake.
Why are you crying then?
I even saw that word typeset.
What word?
Great!
This is pure alcohol.
Not much, but it might help.
You've got all drenched up.
You look like a scarecrow!
Really, I'm all wet.
I guess I'll go and take a shower.
Where's my comb?
You know who you resemble now?
- Who?
- Maria Timofeyevna.
What Maria Timofeyevna?
Here. You've been looking for your comb, haven't you?
Tell me, who's Maria Timofeyevna?
There was such a woman,
Captain Lebyadkin's sister.
You're the spitting image of Lebyadkina.
In what way do I resemble her?
Yes, Fyodor Mikhailovich was...
Whatever you may say...
What?
Lebyadkin, bring some water!
The difference is her brother would not bring her water, but beat her.
Explain it. I don't understand.
All your life is just that
"bring some water!"
Just an appearance of independence.
If something doesn't suit you, you pretend it doesn't exist.
What nonsense you're talking!
I'm amazed at the patience ofyour ex-husband.
He should have run away much sooner.
What do you want from me?
Have you ever admitted you were wrong? Never!
You just made up this whole situation!
As long as you haven't succeeded in elevating your dear husband to this nonsensical emancipated condition ofyours, then you can be sure he has been saved just in time.
As for your children, you will definitely make them miserable.
Stop this idiocy!
Come on now, Masha!
Leave me alone!
My earthly life traversed but by a half,
I found myself lost in a twilight forest...
I always said that you resemble my mother.
Apparently, that's the reason we divorced.
I notice with horror how much lgnat is becoming like you.
Why with horror?
We two could never talk like normal human beings.
When I recall my childhood and my mother, somehow she always has your face.
I know why though.
I pity you both, you and her.
Why?
Ignat, put the glass down!
You won't be able to live a normal life with anyone.
Probably.
Don't feel offended.
You seem to be convinced that the very fact ofyour existence close by will make everybody happy.
You only know how to demand.
That's because I was brought up by women.
Ifyou don't want lgnat to become like that, get married as soon as possible.
- Get married to whom?
- This I don't know.
Or give lgnat to me.
Why didn't you make it up with your mother? It was your fault.
What fault?
She's convinced herself she knows better than I how I should live.
That she can make me happy.
As far as mother is concerned,
I can feel it better than you.
What can you feel better?
That we're getting more and more distant, and I can't do anything about it.
Natalya, try to distract him.
He's talking of Spain again.
It will end up in a scandal.
I wanted to ask you for a favor...
We're redecorating now.
Ignat wants to live with you for a week.
I will be very happy.
What does he say?
He's showing the great matador
Palomo Linares.
Most of all he was excited by the farewell he was given.
The whole town came to see him off.
People sang and danced.
His mother couldn't come, she was sick.
And his father stood aside, sad and silent.
He knew they were thinking the same thing: that they probably will never see each other again.
Are you mocking at us or what?
We taught you and taught and it was no use.
Now it turns out you can!
He went to Spain and didn't understand anything.
Did you ever want to go back to Spain?
I can't go, I've got a Russian husband.
And Russian children.
I'll talk to her myself!
Ignat!
Come here. I'm leaving.
Always in a hurry...
Don't put it together, just give it to me like that.
- Oh, I felt an electric shock.
- What shock?
As if it had already happened...
But I've never been here before.
Come on, give me the money and stop dreaming.
Clean up a bit, make the place tidy.
Don't touch anything here.
If Maria Nikolaevna comes tell her to wait for me.
Come in. How are you?
May we have another cup for the young man?
Take the notebook from the third shelf in the bookcase, will you?
Read from the page that is marked with a ribbon.
"To the question how sciences and arts affect people's morals, Rousseau answered:
Negatively'."
Read only what is underlined with the red pencil.
"Notwithstanding the..."
Oh no!
"The division of churches separated us from Europe.
We remained excluded from every great event that had shaken it.
However, we had our own, special destiny.
Russia, with her immense territory, had swallowed up the Mongol invasion.
The Tartars didn't dare crossing our western borders.
They retreated to their wilderness and Christian civilization had been saved.
To attain that goal we had to lead a special kind of life which, while leaving us Christians, had made us alien to the Christian world.
As for our historic insignificance,
I cannot agree with you on that.
Don't you find anything significant at all in today's situation in Russia that would strike a future historian?
Although I'm heartily attached to our sovereign,
I'm not at all delighted with everything I see around me.
As a man of letters,
I'm being annoyed, insulted, but I swear that for nothing in the world would have made me change my home country or have any other history than the history of our forbears, such as it was given us by God."
From Pushkin's letter to Chaadayev.
October 19, 1836.
Go, open up.
I'm afraid I've got the wrong address.
Ignat, how are you doing?
Did Maria Nikolaevna come?
No. Though some woman came, but she's got the wrong apartment.
Find something to do or invite somebody.
Do you know any girls?
You mean from my class?
Oh no!
At your age I was already in love...
During the war...
With a redhead...
Her lips were always blistered.
Our military instructor was chasing after her, he was shell-shocked.
Are you listening to me?
What did you fire at?
You think I didn't see it?
You were firing up!
What's wrong with that?
There's no one there.
And what if somebody was there?
There're only trees there.
And what if somebody climbed a tree?
About face! I commanded
"about face"!
Put down your rifle.
That's what I did.
Did you learn drill regulations?
About face in Russian means exactly what I did.
About face means a turn of
360 degrees.
What degrees? About face!
To the firing position forward march!
I'm going to send you for your parents.
What parents?
You'll know very soon what parents.
What is the firing position?
Down on the floor mat!
His parents died during the siege.
The firing position is... a firing position.
- Markov!
- Yes, sir!
Name the basic elements of...
The rifle.
The butt.
- The muzzle.
- It's you who's a muzzle.
What is the muzzle then?
Guys! A grenade!
It's a hand grenade!
Don't do it!
Down on the ground!
You'll be killed!
It's only a dummy grenade.
And you say you're from Leningrad and been under the siege...
I don't believe in premonitions.
I have no trust in superstitions.
I don't run from slander or venom.
There's no death on earth.
All are immortal,
Everything's immortal.
Don't be afraid of death at seventeen,
At seventy as well...
There's just reality and light.
There's neither death nor darkness in this world.
At last we all have reached the shore,
And I'm the one who casts a fishing rod
When immortality is coming in a shoal.
Live in a house, and it'll never fall.
To any ofthe centuries I'd nod
And enter it, a house I'd install.
That's why with me your children share board,
Your wives join me at my table, and all.
One table serves both granddad and grandchild:
The future's being made right now.
Whenever I'm to raise my hand in tide,
I all five rays of it on you bestow.
With collarbones, as ifwith timber work,
I propped up every day of past age.
I measured time by a world-wide walk,
I passed through it like through the Urals range.
I chose the age up to my own measure.
We headed south, with dust flying away,
The weeds smoked up, and at his own leisure,
His feeler on the horseshoe, the grasshopper forecast...
He prophesied me death, as if he were a monk.
But with my fate strapped to my saddle fast,
I'm riding now in the time to come
And surging on the stirrups to my own drum.
My immortality is quite enough for me.
For my own blood to flow ages through,
For steady warmth and a haven safe and true
I'd give my life self-willingly and freely,
Had not its volatile, needle-like sword
Been leading me, like a thread, throughout the world.
Marousia? And the children?
Where are the children?
I'm going to tell everybody that you've stolen the book.
- What?
- I will, you'll see.
- Now stop it!
- Go on, tell everybody!
I will, anyway!
Marina!
You could have come more often.
You know that he's missing you.
Let lgnat live with me.
Are you serious?
You said yourself that he would like to.
With you it's better to keep one's mouth shut.
You mean I'm inventing this for my own pleasure?
Let's ask him.
Whatever he decides...
Besides, it will make your life much easier.
Why would this make it easier for me?
Have you collected your books?
Go say goodbye to your father.
Your mother and I would like to ask you...
What?
Wouldn't it be better if you lived with me?
How?
You and I will live together.
Haven't you said so to your mother?
Said what? When?
No, please.
We really look alike, don't we?
Not at all!
What do you want from your mother?
What kind of relationship?
The kind of relationship you had in your childhood is impossible.
You speak of some feeling of guilt, of her life being ruined because of you...
Well, you can't get away from it.
And what she needs is for you to become a baby again, for her to be able to carry you and protect you.
Why on earth am I meddling in it?
It's always like this...
Why are you whimpering?
Explain it.
Should I marry him or not?
- Do I know him?
- No...
Is he Ukrainian?
Does it matter?
- What is he doing?
- He is a writer.
Doesn't his name happen to be
Dostoyevsky?
Yes, Dostoyevsky.
He hasn't written anything worthwhile. Nobody knows him.
He must be about 40, isn't he?
Apparently he's got no talent?
You've changed so much.
So, he has no talent, he doesn't write anything.
He does write, but they don't publish him.
Look, our precious flunk has put something on fire.
No need to be so ironic about his flunking.
If he doesn't finish school, he'll end up being drafted.
And you will go begging to have him exempted from the army.
This is all the result ofyour indulging him.
By the way, the army would be good for him.
Why don't you call your mother?
After Aunt Lisa's death she stayed in bed for three days.
Wasn't she supposed to come here at five?
Is it so difficult to make the first move?
We were talking about lgnat.
It may be my fault, too.
Or is it because we got so bourgeois?
And our embourgeoisement is so dense, so Asian.
With private ownership nonexistent, our well-being is on the rise.
Nothing makes any sense anymore.
Why do you get so irritated?
I know a family whose 15-year-old son said:
"I'm leaving you.
It disgusts me to see how you weasel around trying to please everybody."
Good boy.
Not like our booby.
Unfortunately, our boy would never say such a thing.
I can imagine that family ofyours!
They're no worse than we are.
He works for a newspaper.
And thinks he's a writer, too.
Though he's unable to understand that a book is not a way of making money but a statement.
A poet is called upon to provoke a spiritual jolt and not to cultivate idolaters.
What am I going to do?
You're going to get married.
Do you happen to remember who was it who saw a bush on fire?
I mean the angel as a bush?
I don't remember.
In any case, it was not lgnat.
Maybe we should send him to a cadet school?
An angel as a flame coming from a bush appeared to Prophet Moses.
He led his people out across the sea.
Why has nothing like that ever appeared to me?
With an amazing regularity
I keep seeing one and the same dream.
It seems to make me return to the place, poignantly dear to my heart, where my grandfather's house used to be, in which I was born 40 years ago right on the dinner table.
Each time I try to enter it, something prevents me from doing that.
I see this dream again and again.
And when I see those walls made of logs and the dark entrance, even in my dream I become aware that I'm only dreaming it.
And the overwhelming joy is clouded by anticipation of awakening.
At times something happens and I stop dreaming ofthe house and the pine trees of my childhood around it.
Then I get depressed.
And I can't wait to see this dream in which I'll be a child again and feel happy again because everything will be still ahead, everything will be possible...
Mommy!
- Mom, they opened up!
- What's the matter with you?
Hello.
Hello.
- Are you Nadezhda Petrovna?
- I don't think l...
I'm Matvey lvanov's stepdaughter.
He was a friend ofyour husband.
What Matvey?
The doctor. He used to live here.
Then he moved to Yurievets and became a legal expert.
Are you from town?
We're from Moscow, but we have a room in Yurievets.
We were evacuated last fall.
The air raids on Moscow began and I have two kids.
My mother has some old connections here...
My husband is not here, he's in town.
Stop scratching yourself!
Actually I came to see you.
It's a ladies' little secret.
Come on in.
Don't stand there...
Wipe your feet.
Masha's just washed the floor.
Sit here for a while.
We won't be long.
Why are you sitting in the dark?
Did it go out?
You should've called us.
- What's your name?
- Alyosha.
I've got a son, too.
Not so big as you, of course.
It's not easy having kids now, with the war going.
I wish I had a girl too.
Want to have a look? He's asleep.
We'll be quiet.
He's such a darling.
The other day he asked his father:
"Why is 5 kopecks bigger than 10 kopecks?"
I was just dumfounded, and his father didn't know what to say.
He always wanted a daughter.
He even thought of a girl's name.
And I prepared a pink layette.
Then I had to make everything anew.
He put us up to a lot oftrouble, little rascal.
We woke you up, didn't we?
That's your mommy's fault, she just can't stop talking.
See, we've got company.
Some strangers, aren't they?
You just wouldn't wake up, would you?
All right, honey, go back to sleep.
Do they become me? And the ring?
- What's wrong?
- I just felt queasy.
Of course, you've made a long trip.
I should have known better.
Have a drink. It will warm you up.
I just talk and talk when I ought to make supper.
Oh please, you don't have to do it.
- But I can't let you go like that.
- We had a meal before leaving.
I don't like his cough!
Well, he runs wild...
We must have my husband examine him.
We can't wait, we have a two-hour walk to make.
And what about the earrings?
My husband's got the money.
We're going to have a cock slaughtered. Only may I ask you...
I'm three months pregnant and having fits of sickness.
Even when I'm milking a cow, it gets so bad...
As for the cock...
Could you?
Well, I myself...
What, you too?
No, but I've never done it before.
Oh, it's nothing. Sure, in Moscow you ate them already slaughtered.
I usually do it right here, on this little log.
Here's the axe. My husband has sharpened it this morning.
- You mean, right in the room?
- We'll put a basin under.
And tomorrow you'll take a chicken with you.
No, I can't.
Maybe we'll ask Alyosha to do that?
After all, he's a man.
Why Alyosha?
All right, hold it tight. If it breaks loose, it'll smash the dishes.
Oh no, I don't feel... Well?
Calm down. Everything will be all right.
I wish I could see you not only when I feel too bad.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.
At last I soared up.
What's wrong, Marousia?
You feel bad?
Don't be surprised.
I love you.
Are you leaving already? And the earrings? My husband'll be right here.
- He's got the money.
- We changed our mind.
It's fifteen versts to the town.
It's going to be dark soon.
That's all right, don't worry.
A man has but one body,
Like a single cell.
The soul is sick and tired
Of its too solid shell,
With ears, mouth, eyes
The size of a nickel coin
And skin all scarred and diced,
Spread over a skeleton.
Through cornea it wings
To a heavenly spring,
To ice-laden slings,
To a chariot birds bring.
It hears through the grating
Of its living prison pen
The fields' and forests' rattling,
The Seven Seas' refrain.
Without body a soul's nude,
As a body's nude without a shirt:
No thought's forthcoming, no good,
No idea's born and no word.
A question that has no answer:
Whoever can come back
From the floor where no dancer
Was ever to leave track?
I dream of another soul, ln quite a different garb:
While shifting between dole
And hope, it burns up,
Like alcohol, and goes
Away, casts no shadow
And just leaves as mementoes
The lilacs smelling of meadow.
Run on, my child, do not lament
The fate of poor Eurydice,
Just keep on driving to globe's end
Your copper hoop for all to see.
As long as answering to your step,
However slight might be a tone,
The earth sends signals gay and pep
To every energetic bone.
Mom, the kerosene stove is smoking.
What?
Everything will depend on him.
Do you think a sore throat could have such an after-effect?
A sore throat has nothing to do with it.
- This is a common case.
- Common?
A mother dies suddenly, then the man's wife and child...
A few days and the man is no more, though he was quite healthy.
But no one died in his family.
There're such things as conscience... memories...
What memories have to do it with it?
- You think he's guilty of something?
- He thinks so.
Leave me alone.
- Did you say something?
- Leave me alone!
I just wanted to be happy.
And what's going to happen to your mother if you don't get up?
It's nothing, everything will be all right...
Everything will be...
Would you rather have a boy or a girl?

Hey, anybody in?
Quiet!
Come here!
I beg your pardon!
Which way to Lubicz and Wodokty?
Turn right by the cross for Lubicz, straight ahead for Wodokty.
Thanks!
You go on to Lubicz!
Good bye!
Hey, where's your mistress?
Here I am.
I'm Andrzej Kmicic.
The wind blew me here straight from camp to pay my respects.
A lucky wind, I hope.
You knew of Grandpapa's death?
I've already mourned my benefactor.
He's bequeathed
Lubicz and you to me.
Don't avert your face,
I can't see my legacy.
Oh, what a lovely one!
A hundred masses for my benefactor's soul?
When shall we be wed?
Stay, it's too early,
I'm not yet yours.
But you will be, or I'll burn down this house!
You're mine by the will of the dead and your heart.
I don't know yet about my heart
If you won't be mine
I'll stab myself!
You say that in jest, sir!
Come, my aunt will have supper sewed.
Whose aunt?
Mine.
Then she's my aunt too!
Kulwiecéwna.
I'd have come earlier, but war is a matchmaker only with death.
You weren't in a hurry.
The ensigns were already back.
I stayed to stalk the foe.
I harassed them so much, there's a price on my head.
This goose is delicious.
In the name of the
Father and of the Son...
The enemy's locked himself in the cities, the winter's so severe.
My men are worn out, like brooms from constant sweeping, so the Hetman assigned us to winter quarters.
I've sent my officers to Lubicz.
They'll come here tomorrow, to pay their respects to you.
Drink some wine, sir, please.
I'd drink poison if it was from your hands.
Your health!
The more I look at you, the more I want to marry.
When shall we be wed?
It's untimely to speak of it while in mourning.
Then I'll wither before the time is up.
Deuce take it!
Grandpapa always said you were a hothead.
You must get accustomed to it.
And you must change your habits, it cannot be like this!
Oh, so you're going to lead me by the nose.
You don't look like a man who is easily led.
They broke a lot of rods in the monastery teaching me wise maxims.
Which one do you remember best?
When in love, fall at her feet.
Let me go or I'll be angry and call my aunt.
A regiment of aunts can't stop me when I'm eager.
Traitor! Judas!
I'm not, because my kiss is sincere.
Shall I convince you?
Don't you dare!
Where I'm from they say: ask, and if it is not given, take it!
I must leave now.
It's late.
You've a long way to
Lubicz, and wolves aplenty.
I'll come with my companions on a visit tomorrow.
Goodnight...
Oh, auntie!
Here's health to my lady!
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!
Well, what is she like?
Very pretty?
Damn it! There's no other like her!
You're lucky to have someone to snuggle up to.
When's the wedding?
When the mourning's over.
Damn the mourning!
Children aren't born black but...
...white!
Here's to grandpapa Billewicz, who left you Lubicz!
Stupid! Drinking the health of the dead?
We'll sleep on straw, only don't turn us out!
Stop it.
Whatever is mine, is yours!
He won't abandon us!
Drink up!
He slashed at me like this, and I like this!
One, two, three!
You can't match Kmicic anyway!
Nobody can!
Slice them off!
No one can match him! Just try!
You can't beat me at shooting!
One ducat a shot!
Two! Between the horns!
Three! Five! Pistols!
Loaded?
Straight into the skull!
Between the horns!
He missed!
Eight in the middle! Bravo!
Fight! Die! Slay!
Wenches! Wenches!
This mustn't go any further, my reputation is at stake.
I already told girls and households not tell anybody.
Do you love me?
Like my own soul.
Colonel, sir! Stop!
He's one of my soldiers, something has happened.
What is it, Soroka?
The town is on fire, they're fighting.
Holy mother!
Don't worry.
Who's fighting?
Villagers didn't want to give fodder.
Soldiers took it.
They began firing.
Making a terrible row, bells are tolling.
We must go to their aid!
Burn the town! To arms!
Silence!
A horse!
I don't need you!
I don't want a shambles!
Back to Lubicz and wait for me.
But... Sir...
Not a word.
Farewell! Regards.
We can't have our sleigh ride.
Don't worry.
Let's drink some booze, it's cold!
They're from Lubicz.
Yes, Kmicic's companions.
Let's have another.
It smells of mead.
We don't want booze, give us mead!
There are wenches sitting by the fire.
What are you doing, damsels?
Warming our feet.
Warming their feet!!
I know a better way of warming feet.
Dance and the cold will go away!
We don't need violins,
I'll play on my battle hammer.
Go away!
Perhaps you'd dance with me?
Who are you?
Are you looking for trouble?
No use talking, away with you!
Get out!
I am my own master when I'm sitting over a pitch of mead.
I don't care for gold
I will gladly drink instead.
I was worried.
My sweet maid!
I was afraid there might be a battle.
A few villagers silenced by soldiers, that's all.
What do you mean "silenced"?
One sword stroke on the head is enough.
But that's murder!
The burghers sent for help.
A few lads and officers came.
I chased them off... and drove the officers naked in the snow.
Shame on you!
Are you sincere or just pretending?
You'll be brought to trial.
Don't you worry about that.
Everybody is his own master in this country.
If he has a sword and a few men.
Who am I to fear?
I won't marry a man with blood and tears on his conscience.
Don't drive me mad!
What do you want from me?
Just be decent.
Be well.
Farewell.
For God's sake!
Do you want me to drop dead from my horse?
Don't cry!
For God's sake, don't cry, my dearest!
I'll send them away,
I'll make up for everything.
I'll lead a different life.
I'll change.
Anybody in there?
Have they drunk themselves silly?
Rekué, it's me.
Bring me a priest.
Who slaughtered you?
Who did it?
The Butryms.
Come here!
Olenka, wake up!
Wolmontowicze is on fire!
What a disaster!
Wolmontowicze is on fire!
Can you hear me?
Oh, God!
He did it.
Holy Patriarchs,
Pray for him.
From evil death.
Save him, oh Lord.
From all evil...
Open the door!
My horse fell in the forest.
They're after me.
You burnt Wolmontowicze.
Yes, yes, I did!
The Devil coming for my soul, eh?
All right.
What's going on?
What do you want?
Kmicic has burnt Wolmontowicze.
Murdered men, women and children.
We killed his people and now we want his head!
Follow him, why do you stand here?
Isn't he here?
We found his horse.
No, the house was locked up.
Search the stables.
He's escaped to the woods!
Follow him!
Stop!
Don't hide him, miss, he's accursed.
I curse him just as you do.
Amen.
Come out, sir!
Take a horse and go!
You've blood on your hands like Cain.
Go and stay away forever!
One seldom meets such worthy people as you.
I couldn't feel better in the Prince's castle.
We thank you, sir, that you decided to stay here.
Though you'd have had the best care at the Hetman's court.
I'm all right now, my arm is fit to wield the sword.
Colonel, sir,
Kmicic has abducted the young lady.
I wonder he dared to come here.
Must be very sure of himself.
After me!
Hide behind the carriages!
To the house!
Break down the door with axes.
Stop! Stop it, hell! We'll talk.
Who's that?
Andrzej Kmicic. Who is there?
Colonel Wolodyjowski.
No time for greetings.
You ruffian, you must account for the innocent blood you've shed and this abduction.
You wouldn't call me a ruffian at an open door.
Then open it.
Listen carefully.
I have a keg of powder here.
Leave me alone or I'll blow up the house and everybody in it.
He's mad and ready to do it.
Come out and fight with me.
If you win, you'll go free.
A nobleman's word?
No! Don't do it!
Silence, damn it!
If I don't, he'll blow us all up.
Well, do the poor gentry agree?
They'll swear by their swords if you like.
Let them swear.
Assemble here, gentlemen.
All those present are my witnesses that I've challenged Mr Kmicic to a duel, and I've promised he'll go free if he wins, without any hindrance on your part.
Swear it!
I swear to God Almighty and on the Holy Cross. Amen.
Come out!
I trust your word.
Which one is Mr Wolodyjowski?
I am.
Well, you're not a giant.
Where do we fight?
Here.
All right.
I feel sorry for you,
I've heard you're a great soldier.
So I say for the last time: leave me alone.
Come on!
You asked for it.
Shall we wait until the rain stops?
It's all the same to me.
It's unpleasant to die in such heavy rain.
A Colonel will be buried, so the sky weeps.
Come on, sir!
You use your sword like a flail.
Pick it up!
Finish it, spare the shame.
He's alive, he didn't fall on his back.
Go away!
Now he's mine, not yours.
No butchering. We're knights.
One doesn't finish off a wounded man.
Dress his wound.
Young lady, you're free.
I'm Colonel Wolodyjowski.
Is he dead?
Do not fear, young lady.
Kmicic is unconscious.
Without boasting, I'm the one who did it.
By God, answer me, is he dead?
Kmicic?
Just wounded.
Thank you sir.
I've come to ask if you bear me a grudge.
Thank you for coming, sir.
I bear no grudge,
I was defeated by a fine man.
So you are the famous Misha': Wolodyjowski?
Strictly speaking, I'm Jerzy Michai, but Saint George only fought a dragon and as Saint Michael is the war lord in heaven,
I prefer to have him as my patron saint.
George is certainly no equal to Michael.
How's your health, sir?
It was a near thing.
Where did you learn to fight like that?
At war.
I'm threatened with lawsuits here.
I burnt down Wolmontowicze, that's true.
And hacked up some people.
But my companions were slaughtered too, like oxen.
And why?
Just because they wanted to dance with some damsels?
Poor souls.
As for abducting the girl, it's true she saved my life, but threw me out afterwards, so what could I do?
Well, I'll tell you, sir.
She loves you.
How do you know she loves me?
I saw her looking at you when you lay wounded.
She loves you.
If you don't understand, it's because you had your head split open.
If it was true!
I didn't say she'd marry you.
It is wartime now.
You can render great services to your country.
Win fame for courage and patch up your reputation.
Is there still time for me to do it?
I have to go to court straight from bed.
There's a remedy for that.
The Lord Hetman's writ.
You are to enlist soldiers and form a regiment.
You'll serve our country and be forgiven.
The Hetman left it to me... to give you this writ...
...or not.
What are you going to do?
And I am giving you this writ.
I'm happy to see you sir.
I'd go through
I'd go through fire for you.
Don't say that, please.
This is Andrzej Kmicic.
Why have we been called here?
We'll probably take the field.
My Lord Hetman invites you to come in, gentlemen!
My Lord Hetman invites you to come in, gentlemen!
Forgive me for keeping you waiting.
But there are so many things to do now.
I summoned you to announce unpleasant news.
Apart from the old war we have a new one.
The Swedes have broken the truce.
A beautiful country and valiant people.
But struggles between magnates, averse to the king.
What is the news from the Polish camp?
The gentry are assembling sluggishly.
Perhaps we'd better wait till King Karol Gustav arrives with the whole army.
I'd advise that if this country had a regular army.
But there's none,
I know this country well, the King is weak and lacks money.
Our forces are more than enough against their gentry.
So I may presume that this is already our land.
You may, Your Grace, you may.
What do people say?
The Colonels wonder why they were summoned without their regiments.
Are there many of the gentry?
All the important families.
Call Kmicic.
Did you come with your regiment?
As you said, sir.
Are they reliable people?
They'd go through fire and hell.
I need such men.
And men like you.
Ready for anything.
Such hard times may come that even the most loyal will waver.
May he who deserts Your Grace in the hour of danger perish.
Olenka Billewicz is here.
I sent for her, to reconcile you two.
How can I repay Your Grace for this?
How can I repay for this?
Have faith in me.
Trust me, and believe that whatever I do, is for the public good.
Don't desert me when others do.
I swear.
Swear by this crucifix that you'll not desert me till you die.
Swear by Christ's Passion.
By Christ's Passion
I swear it.
Welcome, gentlemen, brothers!
It's good that you've come.
We need great strength to save our country, and to assist me in my endeavours to do so.
I drink your health.
To the Colonels!
Suprema lex
- love of our country.
Long live the Lord Hetmam!
Defensor Patriae!
Lead us against the Swedes!
When I lay abed, close to death,
I told myself:
I won't take her by force, by sword and fire, but win her by good deeds.
I'll restore my good name at war, and be reconciled with all.
Won't you say just one kind word?
Can I believe you?
You must.
You should.
My Lord Hetman and Mr Wolodyjowski did.
Why would you alone not believe?
I've seen tears shed because of you.
Graves not yet covered by grass.
Grass will cover them.
And I'll wipe away the tears myself.
Do all that first.
Give me some hope at least.
Many among You will be surprised or even horrified by this toast.
But whoever believes and trusts me, and has the good of the country at heart, whoever is a loyal friend of the house of Radziwill, will drink it willingly and repeat after me:
Long live Carolus Gustavus,
King of Sweden!
From this day graciously reigning over us!
Vivat, vivat!
My God!
What have I done!
Your Grace, in Christ's name!
Have mercy on yourself!
Have mercy on us!
Have mercy on Poland!
Don't do it!
Don't implore him, he's a traitor!
May you die in despair!
May your lineage extinct!
May the devil take your soul, traitor!
Traitor!
Thrice traitor!
Traitor!
Traitor!
Traitor!
Kmicic, come here!
Shame on those who follow the Hetman.
Make your choice!
Jesus!
You swore by the Cross you wouldn't desert me.
I'll be damned if I keep this oath, and damned if I don't.
For Christ's sake!
Do you think that I've accepted
Karol Gustav as king forever?
That I want to unite this land with Sweden?
I want to save our country.
And all means to this end are good.
I need power.
But not out of pride.
Let he who is strong enough take it.
But if there's no such man
I'll take it.
What do you want, My Lord?
I want the crown.
Jesus and Mary!
I've surrendered this country to the Swedes to vanquish other foes with their arms.
But rocky Sweden has not enough men, not enough swords to keep the whole of Poland.
So what will they do?
Whom will they give it to?
I'll take the crown.
And when I've rebuilt this crumbling edifice, and made it more powerful,
I'll trample our foes with this foot.
So help me God and he Holy Cross.
Your Grace!
My mind can't grasp it.
My head is bursting!
What's going on there?
Perhaps help is coming?
Lift me up.
Give us back our Colonels!
It's Oskierko's infantry.
MY men!
I knew they'd claim us.
Tell them to send for your regiment!
Be quiet!
What's that?
The Scottish Regiment.
They're against us.
Our people are attacking.
Kmicic with his riders...
On whose side?
I don't know I couldn't see.
Did he throw down his mace yesterday?
I couldn't see.
To think I had this man at my mercy.
And let him live.
Wolodyjowski saved
Your Grace's life.
It was his duty.
But I'll have him shot as a rebel.
You won't do it.
I implore you, My Lord.
Spare him and the others.
Don't refuse me this favour.
And if I refuse?
Then have me shot too.
Remember who you're speaking to, wretched man!
Don't drive me to despair.
I could have listened to a supplication.
But I won't listen to threats.
Let me serve you with all my heart, not under compulsion.
Otherwise I'll go crazy.
I wrote their death sentence in my mind yesterday.
What the Hetman has written, the future Polish King can cancel.
You've got a persuasive way,
I can't refuse you anything.
Till the end of the war
I'll put them under Swedish guard.
Thank you, My Lord, my father.
Your regiment's somewhere near, isn't it?
We could try to escape.
How can we escape?
Who's that officer commanding the convoy?
Roch Kowalski,
Roch Korab Kowalski.
Tom might as well talk to his horse.
He's just as stupid.
And he's an officer?
The Prince liked him.
He breaks horseshoes in his hands.
And he'll carry out any order no matter what.
I like him very much.
I always prefer to know who I'm dealing with.
Mr Kowalski!
Come closer please.
What do you want?
Have you any liquor?
I have.
Give us some.
Why should I?
If it was forbidden, you'd have explicit orders.
But you haven't, so give me some.
You can't force me to.
No, but you're allowed to.
It's decent to help an old kinsman, who, if he'd had married your mother, would have been your father.
Fine kind of kinsman you are!
By my grandmother, she was born Kowalska.
And her crest was Korab.
By God, then you're really my kinsman!
Call me uncle.
How is your father?
By God, I've forgotten his first name!
It's Roch, too.
That's right,
Roch begat Roch.
Such is the comnandment.
Are you married?
I certainly am.
I'm Kowalski and this is my Miss.
I don't want any other.
I don't want any other.
A pity you won't have young Rochs with her.
I see you're a clever cavalier.
Well, let's drink some more.
Drain it dry.
It seems Mr Zagloba wore himself out talking to this stupid lout.
Is he his relative?
Like I'm yours.
Mister Kowalski, your uncle has arrived.
I am Kowalski and this is my Missus.
Where's my sword?
Jesus Christ!
I don't want to boast, but I did it.
I sent the most stupid officer so that they wouldn't get him over to their side, and he betrayed me.
Your Grace shouldn't have sent a Pole.
And make the Swedes think there are no
Poles at my side?
Where's Kmicic?
He went to fetch Miss Billewicz.
Set the regiments ready.
I'll lead them myself!
I have an invitation from the Prince.
I'm glad to see you in good health.
When I arrived,
I saw Olenka, but she disappeared at once.
It's no small honour for us.
But we cannot go immediately.
You cannot dawdle when the Prince waits.
So it's compulsion.
We are supposed to go to Kiejdany.
What for?
The Prince has asked us.
I told you we should flee as they won't leave us alone.
Tie us up, we won't go otherwise.
God will judge who is right, Olenka.
If I, serving the Hetman, or you calling me a traitor.
But you will go to Kiejdany.
No, we won't.
Our servants will defend us.
Here are my men coming.
You must be in the coach in a moment.
Let's go!
Where to, cavalier?
Wolodyjowski!
At your service.
The biter is bitten.
You've bad luck with me.
I stand in your way for the second time.
You were a swashbuckler then but now no honest man would duel with you.
Why is that?
Because you're a traitor.
And you've slaughtered soldiers who wanted to defend our country.
Your last hour has come.
By what right do you judge me?
Pray now, and if you have something in your defence, say it quick.
Because I doubt if this lady will intercede for you now.
I don't ask her favour.
Take him behind the barn and shoot him!
Don't let them maul me like a dog.
I'll go myself.
I'll see if he has any orders on him.
Like Roch had.
Hurry, or they'll be blood stained.
I ordered them to take him far away so the shots don't scare her.
You'll draw vengeance on our heads.
You must escape, come with us.
Right.
Oh God!
You could at least cross yourself.
None of your business, knave.
Get on with it!
You could have taken the wretch with you, to do away with him somewhere else.
How can we go, she's scarcely breathing?
It's done.
We'll put her into the coach, you must flee!
Radziwill's vengeance will spare nobody.
I've stopped the execution!
You did? Why?
Why?
Let me get my breath.
If it wasn't for that worthy man, Kmicic, we'd all be hanging now on trees in Kiejdany.
We wanted to kill our benefactor.
How can this be?
Read this and you'll have the answer.
"We, Prince Janusz Radziwill,
Great Hetman..."
And then...
I'll read it.
"On the intercession of Andrzej Kmicic"...
"we pardon Colonel Wolodyjowski and the waif with him"...
He means me.
"And the other Colonels sentenced to death for mutiny"
"and order them to be confined in the Birze prison".
"On the intercession of Andrzej Kmicic..."
If you're going to have him shot now, then, by God,
I'm parting company with you, and don't want to see you again.
What kind of desperado are you not to have shown it?
You're free, go wherever you want.
Think twice, I warn you, I'm going back to Radziwill.
Stay with us, you'll be our good companion.
The Motherland will forgive you.
No.
God will judge who best serves the Motherland!
You, by unleashing civil war, or I by serving the only man who can save this country.
To whom did you give your oath:
Radziwill, the King?
The Swedes or Poland?
You're out of your mind.
I knew I couldn't convert you.
Farewell.
Wait!
It's very important.
Tell us.
Did Radziwill promise you we'd stay alive?
Yes, you were to be kept in prison.
Then know your Radziwill, who betrays not only his country but his servitors too.
"After dismissing the convoy shoot all of these men..."
"but so that the news doesn't spread".
What's this?
The Hetman's letter to the Swedes.
I found it on Roch Kowalski.
I wish I'd perished at your hands.
Make haste, a sword hangs over our heads here.
With that man left alive, they won't murder us at once.
Hurry!
We'll be ready by the dawn.
God grant that we meet in better times.
Farewell.
Please remember a soldier who wishes you well.
Accept, sweet flower, an old man's farewell too.
Where's Kmicic?
He's back, alone.
Call him!
I came too late, they escaped.
I wanted to follow them, there's a rumour that all the Polish regiments have mutinied.
The only profit:
I've brought the girl here.
And you were saved by my letter!
Which letter, Your Grace?
The one written to me or to the Swedes?
So you know?
Yes.
Be gone.
How could you do such a thing to me?
Silent!
I won't be silent!
I was made to feel ashamed of Your Grace.
I ordered the Swedes to shoot them to spare you pain.
Look what you've done.
They're at the head of the rebellion.
Your sentiments and my weakness for you have harmed the country.
Perhaps.
But each day will be greater torture.
You're in despair because of that girl.
When will you marry her?
There'll be some fuss but next morning she'll dry her tears.
She doesn't want me,
I don't want her.
I won't beg her.
I'd like to go away, to forget.
It's up to you.
You want to leave?
Today if possible.
I'll send you to my brother,
Prince Boguslav,
I'm not strong enough to attack the rebels by myself.
Then you'll carry my letters to King Karolus himself.
Ask him to send me some cavalry and cannons.
I'll crush the rebels.
Have you an)' request?
My Grace...
Speak up, don't hesitate.
I ask Your Grace to protect her from harm here.
Be sure of that.
I'm going far away,
I don't know if I'll see you again.
I wanted to leave without a word but
I couldn't.
Let us not part in anger and rancour.
God be with you.
I have no grudge against you.
An evil spirit has come between us.
Dividing us as though by a sea.
May God guide you.
And show you the right way.
May you leave the one you've strayed to.
Don't speak of it, or we'll quarrel again.
Give me your hand.
Olenka!
Shan't we see each other anymore?
Andrzej!
Leave the traitors and all will be well.
I can't.
You better not say any more.
God, do we deserve this?
Farewell - for the last time.
Why are you crying?
Don't, or I'll go crazy!
Are you the Lord
Hetman's courtier?
My name is Kmicic and I'm not a courtier, only a Colonel.
The famous Kmicic of the last war?
I've heard a lot about you.
This is a letter from My Lord Hetman.
Sit down, cavalier,
Nothing new.
He advises me to move to Taurogi.
Which, as you see, I'm doing.
Here I'd have to declare myself with the Swedes or against them.
And it's too early for that.
The Lord Hetman is always late with his advice.
"Think of the Confederates who mutinied against me".
"They'll plunder my estates, and the beer is strong there".
"Put them to the sword when they're drunk."
Listen, Mr Kmicic.
Pretend to be the
Polish King's follower and a patriot, and murder those who won't betray the King.
Is there any sense in it?
Your Grace!
I serve the Radziwills with heart and soul.
With your fortune mine also may grow.
But I can't grasp and comprehend everything.
What do you want then?
My Lord Hetman all his deeds as being for the good of the country.
Is it only for appearances or the truth?
And if I told you it's for appearances, would you refuse to serve us?
My fortune can grow with that of the Radziwills.
You'll get somewhere.
You see if we, the Radziwills, were living in Spain,
France or even Sweden, where a son succeeds to the throne, we'd probably serve the King and Country and settle for high offices.
But in this country where the gentry elect the King?
Who can guarantee that some day they won't choose to elect a Mr Nobody from Nowhere?
This country is going to hell,
The crown go to the Lord Hetman.
And come to me after him.
More!
More!
Stop!
Saddle the horses!
They're saddled.
Strap the saddlebags!
They're strapped.
A ducat per head!
Thank you Colonel, sir!
Soroka!
You'll take two men and the packhorses.
Take the road to the woods.
Out of town at gallop!
Yes Sir!
The others load your guns.
Saddle two horses for me!
Go!
Stop!
Are you ready to die?
If you're risking your head, sir,
Why shouldn't we?
I'll reward you just as well as the Lord Hetman.
May I ask for a reward in advance?
I have a thoroughbred horse and
I don't want to wear him out.
Would you deign to use it till I return?
Then you'd better sell him to me.
I can't, it'd be like selling a friend.
He's saved me from trouble a hundred times.
And has the added virtue that he bites the enemy in battle.
Where is this wonder?
In the paddock.
A deer's legs, a wolf's step, an elk's nostrils.
And a woman's breast.
Well broken in.
When you're advancing in a row, you can drop the reins, he won't pull ahead one inch.
He keeps in line and the rider's hands are free.
At times one hand was holding a pistol while the other - a sword.
And if the line turns about?
He'll turn about too.
No horse can do that.
Please try, Your Grace.
Two men at your sides with me behind.
I'll give him to you free if he pulls ahead.
All right!
Drop the reins, Your Grace!
Take him!
What's this?
Scoundrels!
Don't you know who I am?
Don't resist or you'll get a bullet.
Traitor!
What about you?
Against whom do you raise your hand?
Easy, you'll wrench my arms!
Let him go.
Where are you taking me?
To the Confederates.
I have your letters, your villainies will be exposed.
Because I believed in the Radziwills!
What's that?
The horses are dead tired.
It won't be a plentiful place to rest in.
I have some food and vodka.
We must gather strength.
Your Grace will kindly dismount.
Why?
I'll eat and drink in the saddle.
Down on the ground, please.
And you into the ground!
Must be the devil.
I smell smoke.
Stupid!
If it was the devil, you'd smell sulphur, not smoke.
Hey!
Anyone there?
Be on your guard!
Carry the Colonel in.
Soroka...
Yes, Sir?
It was the Prince who shot at me, wasn't it?
What happened to him?
He escaped.
That's bad, that's very bad.
He killed three of our men and had the best horse.
So he won.
But we'll meet again.
Soroka!
At your service...
You up already, sir'?
You were sleeping like horses.
One could hack your heads off.
Soroka, we're going to Wolodyjowski.
They'll kill us, Colonel, sir.
I prefer that to being considered a traitor by them.
Show yourself!
What do you want?
Come here!
Don't yell from behind the bushes.
Can two of us advance?
Yes.
A miracle, sir, but I think they're our men.
Where's your second son, Mr Kiemlicz?
Not killed, I hope?
Good God!
Father!
It's Mr Kmicic!
Sweet Jesus!
It's Mr Kmicic!
Come over here!
Well, rascals, do you greet me with guns?
Such a guest!
On your knees, scoundrels!
On your knees!
Who was the first to shoot?
You shot yourself!
He's lying dog! My Lord, such a guest!
I can't believe my eyes.
Kindly come in, please.
What are you waiting for, blackheads?
Bring some mead!
How do you come to be here?
When the Butryms defeated you in Wolmontowicze, we took to the woods.
Misery and hunger.
We live on mushrooms and blueberries.
The cellar is uncovered.
Give us the key, Father.
You'll drink more than you bring!
I'll fetch it myself.
What are you doing now?
We capture horses.
From whom?
From anybody.
From Swedes too?
Surely.
And if they resist?
We thrash them.
You thrash them?
That's good.
You can take horses from the enemy.
But if you take them from your own people, then you're rogues, not nobility.
What do you do with the horses?
Father sells them.
Go cover the cellar!
Mead isn't good for a wound.
Shall I dress it?
That's right, you were my surgeon.
Jesus.
Somebody must have shot you at close quarters, sir.
Kiemlicz! You'll come back under my command
How far are the troops who have mutinied against the Lord Hetman?
3 days by road.
Quicker through the woods.
Kiemlicz!
You'll come back under my command with your sons.
It'll pay off better than horse stealing.
Yes, yes, yes.
It's just hunger and misery.
Only don't try to betray me, you won't succeed.
That we'll never do.
Do you have something to write with?
I'll see.
I must send a letter, but through a reliable man.
We'll find one.
Where is he to go?
To the Lord Hetman but he doesn't need to see him.
It's enough if he delivers it to the first officer he meets.
I have three sheets.
But no ink and no pen.
The pen is here, and ink can be found.
Passable, it's easier to cut heads than pens.
Go away now, Mr Kiemlicz.
By God, it's true, he has our letters!
And there are things in them, that...
But Kmicic can't make these letters public, in doing so he'd pass a death sentence upon his girl.
He realizes it's the only way to keep us in check.
What girl is it?
Olenka Billewicz.
I don't ask her name, only if she's comely.
You don't know her.
Virtue personified, almost a nun.
I've known nuns too.
A defender of the Polish King.
Then we'll multiply his defenders.
Then Kmicic will disclose our secret.
I must guard her like the apple of my eye.
For the time being.
Then I'll give her to you, or even to your dragoons,
I don't care.
Invite her to supper tonight.
I'll have a look and decide if she's worthwhile.
But don't contradict me, whatever I say.
The Polish nobility, make me ashamed, when I compare them to foreign nobility.
A French gentleman can do the worst act.
But he won't raise his hand against his king.
Dear God!
What plots against our ex-king do you refer to?
Who tried to?
I met a certain gentleman on my way here.
That gentleman, not knowing my true sentiments for our king, he thought I was his enemy.
He promised to go to
Silesia to abduct the King for a reward, and deliver him dead or alive to the Swedes.
If he made me such an offer
I'd have him shot without judgment.
Your Grace alone can punish him.
Because he's your Colonel.
By God! My Colonel?!
Who is he?
Tell me!
His name is Kmicic.
That's not true!
If he's your relative or fiancé
I'm sorry to have told you this.
But I advise you to forget him for he's not worthy of you, miss.
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I was wrong to deny it.
That man is capable of anything.
Quiet!
That'll be... about ten horses.
Your Grace!
Have arms at the ready but don't shoot.
Who are you?
And you?
A patrol of confederated regiments.
We were sent to look for Swedes, and suspects.
It seems there are some here, if they won't answer.
Keep calm. Today one can't distinguish friend from foe.
We're going to the Confederates.
Is Colonel Wolodyjowski already in camp?
Perhaps he is but who's asking?
Wolodyjowski's friend.
Forgive me, Your Grace, for not recognizing your rank.
We're Wolodyjowski' soldiers, we'll take you to him.
Jesus! It's Kmicic! Get him!
Father, shall we thrash them?
Thrash them.
Stop!
Stop!
Surrender!
Tie them!
Take the horses and purses!
Take it all!
Hands off!
Holy Mary, it's ours!
Dress their wounds.
A brother's blood on my hands again.
Oh Christ show me the way or I shall surely lose my reason.
They're going against Radziwill...
It's a big force.
God grant them victory.
They've proclaimed me a villain and a traitor all over the country.
Nobody will trust Kmicic,
So, from now on, my name isn't Kmicic.
It is Babinicz, understand?
Yes, Colonel, sir.
Tell the men that even if they're flayed I'm Babinicz.
Where are we going, sir?
To the King.
Holy Mar)'-
But which king?
Not the Swedish one.
But His Majesty's taken refuge in Silesia.
We'll go to Silesia.
What have you decided?
To attack the Confederates with Swedish help.
Now, that's being a Radziwill!
The Swedes only respect the strong.
Go to Taurogi and muster as many men as you can.
Take the wench with you, but remember, if you rape her, it'll be the ruin of both of us.
It is my dearest wish to see you happy here.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Forgive me, my lady.
What's happened, Sakowicz?
Forgive us, my lady.
What happened there?
A spark fell on the powder.
And who caused the fireworks?
Braun did, My Grace.
Have the guilty man shot.
No,
Your Grace.
I beg you.
Yours only to order, not to beg.
I'd burn Taurogi for a single smile from you.
The Prince asks that you deign to accept this gift.
Give him my thanks.
Tell him I'm overjoyed with his gift.
And who are you, kind cavalier?
My name is Braun.
I'm the officer you saved from death.
I owe you my life.
I am at your command.
One more word, cavalier.
Your every word is a favour to me.
Do you know Kmicic?
I've only heard of him.
The Prince told me that Kmicic offered to abduct the Polish King.
Is it true?
I don't know, my lady.
But our officers told me that the Prince met Kmicic on his way to Kiejdany, and bought a horse from him.
The Prince came back very agitated.
It might have been then.
Must be an important Swede.
A general.
Stop.
I was sent to meet Your Excellency by the Swedish King who was anxious about the Imperial Envoy.
Sit down, sir.
Is victory still following
Charles Gustavus?
Some Polish troops have been dispersed, others have joined us.
A few cities and castles are still faithful to the Polish King.
Your Excellency, we are ready to go now.
I've heard the King of Sweden wants to take the Czestochowa Monastery.
His Imperial Majesty has a special sentiment towards this place.
There are orders to occupy all strongholds.
The gentry and peasants are already astir.
The Polish King is nearby in Silesia.
Where it is easy to stir up new revolts.
Excellency, the Monastery is a stronghold.
I am telling you what I heard.
The Swedes plan to attack the Monastery.
And soon this will happen.
You'd like us to believe your tidings.
Yes, by God.
What reward did you expect for it?
All this is my war booty.
I wanted to offer it to Holy Mary, but only after confession, with a clear conscience.
Truth shines through your anger.
But how could we drive the faithful out?
Keep the gates closed day and night?
Reverend Father.
As a soldier I advise you.
Make fast the walls, lock the gates.
For Christ's sake keep the gates locked.
Colonel, Your Grace, we've come to ask you to release us from service.
Don't you want to defend the Monastery?
Dogs!
Well, take your pay and away with you.
Don't touch it.
We're not worthy to look upon the splendours of Czestochowa.
Oh, Holy Virgin, Morning Star.
We're not worthy...
We're not worthy.
But we'll not stop serving you outside the walls.
We'll be your servants, sir, beyond them.
Away with you.
Your Grace, a messenger with important tidings from the Lord Hetman.
I'll receive him tomorrow.
No news from Prince Boguslav?
No, Your Grace.
And from the Swedish King?
The Confederates must have intercepted the letters.
Defeated and besieged,
I'm not needed by anyone.
Boguslav!
Boguslav!
Help.
What do you want?
Take that crown.
Help me.
People!
Jesus!
Where is the Prince?
Lower.
Fire!
Down!
Mad man! You could have been blown to powder!
What? Do we have too much powder?
Then you could load a gun with me and
I'd kill some Swedes after my death.
I didn't expect the clerics to have such officers.
May I ask your name?
Babinicz.
And I am Kuklinowski, an officer.
You must have heard of me.
My name and sword have won fame in many a war, not only in this country but also abroad.
Yes, I've heard of you.
Come on in.
No of fence to you, there are only two real soldiers in Poland.
Kuklinowski in the Kingdom and Kmicic in the Duchy of Lithuania.
The whole country has surrendered, the King has fled abroad.
We
Poles have come here with the Swedes to prevent sacrilege of this holy place when the Monastery falls.
And the Monastery must fall, they're bringing up heavy guns.
But how can we defend it it if you exasperate the enemy with your resistance.
It can only end in destruction of this holy church!
My brothers!
Reverend and beloved Fathers!
Don't have this on your conscience.
You didn't build this sanctuary and it is not only to serve you.
May it bring joy to our sons and grandsons.
I await your answer,
Reverend Fathers.
So you've failed?
Our priests are stubborn.
Between you and me, they're wrong.
We can't defend ourselves forever.
Yon think they're wrong?
You've got brains.
Show me through the gate,
I've something to tell you.
And I you.
All's burning under your feet, only fools stay in a burning house.
Perhaps you're afraid to be called a traitor?
Spit on them who call you that!
Join us!
Me, Kuklinowski, make you an offer.
Do you say that as the Swedish envoy?
I'm not an envoy outside the gate.
I'm speaking for myself.
To hell with this nasty fortress.
So you're speaking for yourself?
Yes.
And can I answer you as yourself?
Why certainly!
Then listen, Kuklinowski,
You're a scoundrel!
A villain and a stinking brute!
What?
A stinking brute!
Is that enough?
Or shall I spit in your face?
That's for you, not the envoy!
Our God he is our stronghold,
Our refuge and protection,
When the foe of truth divine,
Threatens it with destruction
Mother of God and yet virgin,
Blessed by the Lord, Maria,
Mother elected Maria, the Son, our God,
Pray obtain for us, let Him descend...
What do you want?
Father, the walls won't last more than one day.
Father, the culverin must be blown up.
Who's going to do it?
I Will.
Here's a sausage for you, doggy.
Who's there?
Me, Hans.
I'm looking for my ramrod.
Password?
Uppsala.
Hurry up, we're going to start firing soon.
Yes, I will hurry...
I know this bird
He's Babinicz from the Monastery garrison.
My name isn't Babinicz.
I am
Kmicic.
Kmicic?
It's a name famous throughout Poland.
General, he has no equal among soldiers, except perhaps me.
Kuklinowski, what do you want?
Do you want me to spare his life?
I want you to give him to me.
This is all I ask for my services.
Kuklinowski, do you want to save him?
Knacker!
All right, we can talk, we've time.
Kmicic, I told you there are only two real soldiers in this country.
Me and you.
The famous commander, Mr Kmicic, and Kuklinowski's got him, and will burn his sides.
Knacker!
Oh yes, he will burn his sides.
Well, how do you like it, darling?
Not too much right away.
Easy... We've got time.
Who the devil is it?
My Grace, General Miller wants to see you now, sir.
Oh, it's you, Kiemlicz.
All right.
Warm, wasn't it?
You can cool down a little now, darling.
I'll be back soon, for a chat.
Who's there?
We came to have a look.
Then look, you've not seen such a wonder before...
We've been looking for a chance since morning.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Go on! Cut the Colonel's bonds.
The horses are waiting.
How are you feeling, sir?
My legs are a little weak.
Some vodka will help.
Clothes for Mr. Colonel!
I feel better already.
He burnt my side, a little, but it's nothing.
Quick!
I'm all good already.
The horses are waiting.
Oh, no! It cannot be.
I'll stay and wait, for that traitor.
Kiemlicz! What the hell?
Are you mad?
Miller's asleep, they didn't let me in.
What is it?
An officer's waiting for
Your Grace in the stable.
Well, Mr Kuklinowski?
You wanted to be the equal of Kmicic, you scoundrel?
Be one of his company?
Meet Kmicic then!
I'll let you live, so that you can meditate on Kmicic.
Mount the horses. Let's go!
Where to, sir?
To Silesia!
To the King!
I do not say you lie, cavalier.
But if you spoke the truth, your side should be burnt.
Your majesty!
Let the doubting Thomases touch my wounds.
I do believe you.
I never doubted you were telling the truth.
Your merit and pain will not pass for nothing.
But many spies are sent here.
Prince Boguslav reported that an attempt on us was planned.
An attempt on Your Majesty?
We were reported there was a man who offered to abduct us.
And bring us dead or alive to the Swedes.
Who was it?
A certain Kmicic.
It's a lie.
It's a lie!
Prince Boguslav is a liar!
Don't believe that traitor,
Your Majesty!
He lied to disgrace his enemy!
Lift him up and call a doctor.
Your Grace,
God forbid that
I say anything against him,
But he shouldn't be trusted too readily.
Why shouldn't I trust a soldier who's shed his blood for our country and for us?
I haven't yet lost my throne if I have such defenders.
He'll stay with me.
But, Your Majesty...
Enough about this.
Let us discuss the matters I summoned you to.
We're going back to Poland.
Your Majesty, it results from various reports that the time is ripe to return and the King's presence may hasten the victory.
The Tartar Khan has promised his help if the King returns to the motherland.
You traitor!
Treason!
Wait!
For Christ's sake!
Escape, Your Majesty!
I'll hold them!
Kiemlicz,
Follow me!
Forgive me, my sons.
We forgive.
And you forgive us, Father.
I do.
Good people!
Do you know who you've just rescued?
This is your King, you have saved his life.
Your merits won't be forgotten.
Look for Babinicz!
To think you called him traitor!
It is my fault, Your Majesty.
Look for Babinicz!
I will not leave until
I look into his face.
He's still breathing!
Dear God, Babinicz, how shall I repay you?
I'm not Babinicz.
I'm
Kmicic.
You let the Polish King pass.
You let Czarnicki pass.
But Your Majesty...
Your Majesty always has to put his generals' blunders right.
Where is my beloved brother the Polish King now? Tell me!
Where are the Polish armies?
Any news of the enemy?
None, Your Majesty.
We only broke down some peasants and nobles.
Even if I have to chase my beloved royal brother all over Poland,
I'll catch him.
Here's to those who were the first to raise their swords against the traitor Radziwill.
We disobeyed orders for the first and God grant, for the last time.
We couldn't do otherwise.
Allegiance must have its limits, beyond which there is only guilt and crime.
Speaking of Your Majesty's safety,
It was heard from
Prince Boguslav's mouth that...
Was it about Kmicic?
Yes, Your Majesty.
None of that was true,
Boguslav was lying.
Call Babinicz.
But tell me what you know about the man.
He was a great soldier but terribly wild.
And he discredited himself in Kiejdany.
But he entreated Radziwill not to shoot us.
Really?
And Radziwill released you?
Mr Zagloba rescued us from captivity.
He drank with the officer saying he was his kin, took his clothes and went for my regiment.
Without boasting I did it.
Where did you get such wits?
It's a secret, but one must always carry with him hemp seeds and eat them little by Iitle.
It sharpens the wits enormously.
But Why?
There's oil in hemp and that oils the brain.
But the oil goes to your belly not to your brain.
I've got a method for that, too.
One must drink a lot of wine.
The oil, being lighter, floats on top.
The wine, going to one's head, carries it up.
What a shrewd fellow!
You'll find a few bottles in your rooms.
Jesus Christ!
Your Majesty! This is Kmicic!
You've known him as a brawler and Radziwill's ally.
And he's the hero of Czestochowa and my loyal servant, who shed his blood for me.
This is the new Kmicic.
Meet him and love him, he's worth it.
It was not me he wanted to abduct but Prince Boguslav.
Embrace him!
I have liked you from the start!
And I you!
What angel has converted you?
Did you find many people with the Hetman?
Just a few foreign officers.
By God,
I'm not asking about soldiers!
Boguslav took Miss Billewicz to Taurogi.
Woe!
She still loves that fellow Kmicic.
That's certain.
You're lucky to have me as your friend.
Tell me what the devil has whispered in your ear?
Tell me.
I'll be your best man, Your Majesty.
Don't fool, speak up!
There's a defrocked priest here.
What do I care?
He'll tack you together, but as he's a poor craftsman, not a member of the guild, it'll be easy to unpick the stitches.
Do you understand, Your Grace?
Dammit, I understand very well!
Charles Gustavus has summoned me.
I must go in a few days.
Haste will be the explanation why a paltry cleric marries you.
Some day you'll be hanged, Sakowicz.
It cannot be otherwise.
Quicker.
Close in!
I'm still weak.
We take the field today.
I envy you.
Your time will come, remember, sword practice every day, it won't be easy with Boguslav.
One of us is destined to die.
You bend your wrist too much.
A brother wouldn't do more for me.
Look how this candle burns.
What does it augur?
That virtue will melt tonight like wax.
If it could be done now!
If we could be married at midnight.
Put irons in the fire in case the Priest refuses.
It won't be necessary, he is a black villain.
So it'll be a villanous wedding.
Can't be otherwise where the best man's a pimp.
May I see Olenka?
Your Grace...
She says her grandfather's will forbids her to decide her fate.
And that she wouldn't marry Your Grace anyway.
Do you hear that, Sakowicz?
I scoff at your decisions and wills!
But we don't.
According to his last will, she must either take the veil or marry Kmicic.
Who?
Kmicic?
I'll give you Kmicic!
Shut up, you misfit.
Shut up, you withered old maid or I'll cut your sweet throat.
The girl attacked me, she had a dagger,
I knocked it out of her hand, as they taught me in ltalia...
Suddenly I felt a terrible pain, I fell into darkness, my head's still reeling.
The devil must be helping them.
Which of them practices witchcraft?
Not her, she's virtuous.
Perhaps the aunt.
That might be.
The foe has put fire and water between us and is scoffing at us.
Gentlemen!
He who loves God and his country - follow me!
Heir to the house of Genghis Khan, and master of great Hordes.
He will convey our secret thoughts to Your Majesty.
He is our servant and faithful dog who will obey Your Majesty to the death.
They'll start killing the innocent and burning homes.
Your Majesty, allow me to have these Tartars under my command.
I agree.
If the King sent you as a guide, you'll show me the way.
The King sent me as commander, not as a guide.
The Khan rules the Tartars, not the King.
Then listen to me, Aga.
The Khan gave you to the King like a dog.
So don't offend the King, or you'll be taken on a leash like a dog.
Don't irritate me!
Listen, you son of a goat!
You wanted freedom to plunder, burn and slaughter!
You wanted a guide?
Here's your guide!
Here's your guide!
Look at that, slave!
Give me another horse!
Your Worthiness, they won't cross the river.
Then it's no use hiding.
Lead us to attack, Babinicz!
Gentlemen, to your regiments!
Front to the river!
Fire at the ford!
Your Eminence,
I'd try that ford again.
Take the light cavalry, cross the river and attack the supply columns.
My Lord,
Kmicic will be killed!
If he has a head on his shoulders, he'll win, not die.
Now gm!
Cease fire!
That's what I wanted!
Don't kill me! The girl...
Speak up!
What did you do to her?
Spare me, I'll give her back.
I'd give a hundred rascals like you for one hair of hers.
But I don't believe you!
Traitor and perjurer!
I've given the order the order she will die if you kill me.
I'd sooner have expected death.
The devil gave orders to kill Olenka if he dies.
You've released a traitor to the Motherland!
Punish me, God, for my sins, not by my guilt, but by your mercy,
I'll never pass a sentence upon her!
What do you intend to do?
I'm going to Taurogi.
Charles Gustavus is gathering big forces,
I'll be back in two weeks.
Enough!
The Motherland won't perish in two weeks.
Miss Billewicz will bequeath you Wodokty, together with all the land she owns.
The Monastery will get everything you see here.
Are there many sheep?
Are you preparing to shear them already?
One will be enough for you.
Stop!
Stop!
Is he still alive, or dead?
Alive, but death hovers over him.
He was wounded by the Swedes.
He asked to be taken to Lubicz.
That's where he wants to die.
Hurry!
Lord, count in his favour that he's dying at the hand of the enemy.
Forgive him.
Have mercy on him.
Soroka?
At your service, sir.
Who is at
Wodokty?
The young lady.
Praise to God!
Did they ask about me?
Every day, until we told them that you're going to live.
And then they stopped?
Then they stopped.
What do you think of Kmicic, my daughter?
God knows that I don't want to think about him.
But he risked his life and shed his blood for his country.
When? When the foe was losing.
When he could profit by it.
What's of his contribution in this?
That's true, that's true.
Can a chance wound efface that?
I'd give everything for it not to be so.
But it's done and can't be undone.
Praise be to Jesus Christ.
For ever and ever.
We, Jan Kazimierz, King of Poland,
Grand Duke of Lithuania,
Masovia, Prussia etc. etc. etc.
In the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen.
We announce hereby to all that whatever guilt and punishment weighed upon Andrzej Kmicic, they must, considering his subsequent merits and glory be wiped away from human memory.
Andrzej Kmicic was beguiled and persuaded by Prince Radziwill, but saw his error and not only did he never promise to lift his hand against us, but abducted Prince Boguslav to avenge us and the ravaged Motherland.
God, have mercy on me!
Wounded by the Prince, he recovered and defended the Holy Shrine of Czestochowa, where he blew up the biggest
Swedish cannon.
Apprehended by the cruel foe his living flesh was burnt with fire.
Saved from this predicament by the Holy Virgin's power, he came to us, to Silesia, and during our journey back to the Motherland defending our person on the battlefield was found as dead.
Oh God, God!
And when he recovered owing to our care, he fought on, till the enemy was driven away from our country.
Therefore we, considering all his merits, have decided to proclaim them publicly, so that he no longer be persecuted by human hate, but may live in fame and be generally loved as is due to a good man.
Well, Olenka... well?
Jedrus,
I'm not worthy to kiss your wounds!
I'm speaking to you now, Andrzej!
It's not enough to risk your life, slaughter the enemy, so many men have been killed, now you must supply our beloved country with new defenders.
And I trust you won't lack the courage or the desire to do so.
Vivat!
I wish you every happiness, Colonel!
Admiral Yamamoto, please.
He asked not to be disturbed.
- lt is most urgent.
Admiral Yamamoto?
Tokyo has been bombed.
- When?
10 minutes ago. Yokohama, Kawasaki and Yokosuka were also bombed.
His lmperial Majesty is unharmed. l personally phoned the palace.
Damage? - Very little to Tokyo.
No reports from the other cities, but it seems probable that they too were barely scratched.
How did they do it, Watanabe?
They launched long-range
B-25 bombers from their carriers.
They came in at treetop level, and were first seen over the city.
Tokyo ... bombed!
Sir, l understand your concern for the Emperor's safety, but ...
You may speak freely, Commander.
- This raid is a blessing in disguise.
The Americans have proven you correct.
Dur homeland is not invulnerable.
After today, the General Staff will certainly approve your operation M-l.
Lieutenant-Colonel Doolittle led the raid with a force of 16 B-25s and an all-volunteer crew of airmen.
Most of the planes carried
500-pound demolition bombs and single incendiary clusters, which were dropped on oil stores, factories and military sites in Tokyo.
A few planes made minor strikes on Kobe, Yokohama and Nagoya, with one bomb hitting the Japanese carrier Ryuko.
News of this raid has improved
American and allied morale, while at the same time constituting a blow to Japanese prestige.
Thanks, Sir.
At his press conference today,
President Roosevelt was asked:
''Can you tell us, where did those planes start from and go to?''
He replied:
''Yes, the time has come to tell you.
They came from our new secret base at Shangri-la ...''
Well, my God, it's Captain Garth! l was expecting some junior officer.
This is an unexpected honor!
Yeah, like hell it is, Joe!
Admiral Nimitz sent me over to ...
- To chew my ass off, huh?
Dfficially, l'm supposed to question your estimate of Japanese intentions.
Why so grim, Matt? Doolittle's attack should've thrilled you CinCPAC people.
Not by a long shot.
That damn raid could boomerang on us.
We only got 4 carriers in the Pacific. We need to rebuild.
Now the boss is afraid Yamamoto's going to jump back at us. But where?
We got the latest intercepts here.
Here's a list of Japanese ships we suspect will be assigned to amphib operations south of Rabaul.
The Coral Sea! That's where we think they'll strike next.
But something else is stirring, something out our way.
We need facts, not guesswork.
Matt, we cracked Yamamoto's code, but we can't just reel it off.
We get a flicker here and a glimmer there.
How much can you decipher?
- Hell, 15, maybe ...
Really decipher.
- Ten percent.
10 per ... That's one word in 10.
For Christ's sake, you're guessing!
We like to call it ''analysis''.
Alright. What are these indications that something's brewing out our way?
There's no hard clues yet.
- What do you have, Joe? lncreased radio traffic between
Yamamoto's commanders. - That's all?
Could be significant. At least l feel that something's stirring.
Alright, l'll take that list of Jap ships you ''feel'' are headed for Coral Sea.
Nimitz may send Fletcher's task force to see what's going on.
We'll see how your 10-percent guesswork pays off, huh?
As a back-room code-cracker l thank you, Matt.
Joe, could l ask you something very personal? - Certainly. lt really stinks down here.
How often do your people take a bath?
Bath? God, l don't know ...
What day is it?
Forget it, Joe.
Any new Yamamoto intercepts?
Here's a first mention of ''A-F'', whatever that means.
A-F?
Captain!
Tom!
Dad ...
My God, Tom.
When did you get in? l didn't know ...
Last night. - This is beautiful. Why didn't you write that you were coming? l've been assigned to Kaneohe.
- Well, l'll finally see some of you.
Three years!
You look great, Tom.
- So do you, Dad.
Kaneohe, are you? What squadron?
- VF-8.
You'll like it. Your C.D. used to be my wing-man on the old Langley.
Could we talk somewhere?
Sure ... Here. l phoned you from Guam the day you graduated.
Yeah, l heard later. l'm sorry l missed the call. l guess your mother was there?
Yeah.
- How is she?
Recovered from the divorce, l guess.
- That's good. l was hoping maybe we could ...
- Dad, l've fallen in love with a Japanese girl. l want to marry her. l need your help. l damn well guess you do, Tiger.
She's been arrested in Honolulu.
How did you manage that? ln San Diego and getting mixed up with a Japanese girl in Honolulu?
She was a student in San Diego.
- And she was arrested here?
Her parents live here. She wouldn't marry me without their permission.
Apparently, the FBl has something on her folks, so they got picked up.
Well, that figures.
Haruko was born here.
She's as loyal as you or me.
Anyway, the minute l got in l went to see where they're being held.
She wouldn't see me.
- Why not? l don't know.
She and her parents will be sent back to the mainland in a few days. lt sticks in your throat that l want to marry a Japanese girl?
Sticks in your ...? Don't give me that ''racial bigot'' crap. l don't care what color she is.
- lt's not the point ...
Christ almighty!
6 months after Pearl Harbor!
Boy, you have lousy timing.
What's her name? l'll see if l can get her FBl report. l wrote it down for you:
Haruko Sakura.
But promise one thing:
Don't do anything stupid till l see what l can get hold of.
That's a deal. ln my opinion, the plan is not only unnecessary, but doomed to fail.
Admiral Kondo, Dperation M-l was conceived by our best strategist.
We are aware of Captain Kuroshima's authorship and his reputation.
But this time, the god of operations has conceived a monster.
Would you please explain?
How am l expected to land my invasion forces on Midway, unless the enemy airfields and shore batteries have been neutralized?
Admiral Nagumo has said his carriers will obliterate the American defenses.
The enemy's land-based bombers have a range of 400 miles more than Nagumo's carrier planes.
His ships would be blown out of the sea before he launches his attack. l destroyed the US fleet at Hawaii, where the risk was far greater.
Where were the land-based bombers?
A surprise attack with a carrier task force is one thing.
But this, a strike against Midway and the Aleutians with 200 ships and 100,000 men.
Does the idea of taking the Aleutians cause you concern, Hosogaya?
No, Sir. But an operation so complex, l'd like more time to study it.
After all, in a matter of hours our Coral Sea operation begins.
We have sufficient forces for both. l tend to agree with Admirals Kondo and Hosogaya. l suggest we meet again after the Coral Sea campaign.
Very well.
- Gentlemen, consider this:
The Americans are still unprepared and outnumbered. lf their fleet can be lured into battle and defeated, they will have no significant naval force left in the Pacific.
They will have to sue for peace. l have traveled widely in America, my friends.
Their industrial might is awesome. l'm convinced our only hope of victory is one massive strike at Midway.
Joe, are you sure this
''hot information'' of yours can't wait? l already got one thing for the boss.
- l consider this urgent.
And, you were right about Coral Sea.
That's where the Japs were, alright.
Every ship on your list was there.
- Did we get hurt?
We got hurt.
Welcome on, Admiral.
How was your flight?
Long and full of potholes.
Got Fletcher's Coral Sea report?
- Right here, Sir.
Get in back, Joe.
But wait till l cue you in.
Here's Admiral Fletcher's preliminary report, Sir.
We lost the Lexington.
What about the enemy?
We sank one light carrier, one big first-line job and some small ships.
Looks like we just about broke even, Admiral.
We can't trade the Japanese carrier for carrier, Matt.
We started with a 3 to 1 superiority.
With the Lexington gone, the Saratoga laid up, all we've got is the Hornet, the Enterprise and the Yorktown.
Sir, Yorktown was heavily damaged at Coral Sea. There's the report.
Admiral, Commander Rochefort has something urgent, he says. lt's about objective A-F, the meaning of ''A-F''.
Dur listening posts pick up traffic between Yamamoto's flag commanders.
There's been a heavy traffic volume, with references to object ''A-F'' ...
... and A-D. A-D is a mystery, maybe a diversion.
But l think we've identified ''A-F''. lt's Midway. lt had us stymied until one of my men remembered an intercept from March.
A Jap reconnaissance pilot radioed his base that he's close to ''A-F''.
We plotted every course the plane could have have taken, and the only appreciable landmass he could have flown over was Midway.
Joe! - l know it's thin.
- Thin? Damn near invisible!
But l figured out a way to confirm it, Sir. lf you have this flown to Midway. lt's a fake message, Admiral, reporting that Midway's freshwater condenser's broken down. lt should be transmitted in the clear, so the Japanese get every word. lnstruct Midway to include this in their housekeeping traffic tomorrow.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Send this right away.
Hey, chief!
What's this?
There ain't nothin' wrong with our freshwater condenser!
Dombrowski, send it.
Damn heat's gettin' to everybody here.
Have this intercept coded and transmitted to fleet headquarters!
They took the bait, Admiral.
Rochefort just decoded a transmission from Kwajalein to Yamamoto's headquarters:
''A-F has trouble with its freshwater condenser.''
''A-F'' has to be Midway lsland.
Be at my office at 05:00, Matt. l'm calling in the whole staff.
This is how l expect the battle to develop:
The northern force, under Hosogaya, strikes the Aleutians as a diversion.
To keep Nimitz's attention away from our main objective.
He will not realize our objective is Midway until 24 hours later, when
Nagumo's carriers strike the island and destroy the American planes and shore batteries.
At that hour you move in,
Kondo, with your invasion forces.
Nimitz will be forced to respond.
He'll commit the balance of his fleet, most certainly his carriers, to repel the invasion.
His carrier commander will undoubtedly be Admiral Halsey. l have studied his tactics and l have studied the man.
Halsey is courageous, tough-minded and not afraid of risks, but we will turn these strengths against him. lt will take Halsey's task force at least 48 hours to reach Midway.
By that time, Nagumo, you'll have crushed Midway and be waiting for him.
You'll have a better position, and at least a 2-to-1 superiority in carriers, and 4 to 5 times the number of screening vessels.
Assuming the American fleet is still guarding Hawaii when we strike.
Nimitz is crippled and on the defensive.
He must deploy his remaining strength around his most valuable Pacific base. l agree with Admiral Nagumo.
We must make certain where the enemy fleet is. l propose we send 2 flying boats to French Frigate Shoals on the 29th.
We fuel them by tanker submarine and fly them to Pearl Harbor on the 30th.
They then report whether or not the American fleet is actually there.
A very wise precaution indeed.
We will call it ''Dperation K''.
Does anyone have any other thoughts?
Yes.
We can achieve a great victory, providing Nimitz and Halsey do exactly what you expect.
The Enterprise and the Hornet are due in by sundown.
The rest of the task force should be in by morning.
The Yorktown is more severely damaged than we thought.
How soon can we dry-dock her?
By the 17th, if a Jap sub doesn't spot the oil she's trailing.
Admiral Fletcher just radioed in with a repair list.
Tell the yard repairman l want every workman he can get to board her.
That sharpshooter from Washington just landed. Be here in 30 minutes.
Who did they send?
- Captain Vinton Maddox.
Maddox. He's a damned scalp hunter!
See that he's thoroughly briefed, and get Captain Garth up here.
Admiral, why don't you let me handle it?
No, he's entitled to a crack at me.
Phone that in.
Are those arming switches fixed?
- No, we still got some damn snafu.
Get them working 100% , or rip them out of all our SBDs. ls that clear?
Yes, Sir.
- Get to it.
Sorry to drag you out of bed so early, but it's our only chance to talk. lt's DK. Did you get the report?
- Yup. l've already read it.
Did you know your girl belonged to those
Japanese patriotic organizations? l saw the magazines, but l didn't know it was propaganda.
The Attorney General's office says it's subversive.
And the FBl doesn't think she's telling the truth about coming here.
You can't blame them for that.
- Sure l can! And l can clear it up!
You cool down and let me handle this!
Tom, l don't have time to fool around.
Do you want me to help you or not? l guess l have no alternative, do l, Sir? l guess you don't.
Captain Maddox, Admiral Nimitz.
- Great pleasure, Sir.
Should we get right to it, Captain?
- Certainly, Admiral. l'm sure you're aware of Washington's opinion on this Midway invasion.
Yes. They think it's an enemy ruse.
An elaborate phony, Sir.
- Go on.
Could we speak in private?
- lf you'd feel more comfortable.
These enemy radio intercepts your intelligence has accumulated ...
Very detailed ... - Too detailed.
Remember, just before December 7th?
The fake Japanese messages.
- These could be carbon copies.
Washington's sure Yamamoto's feeding you this to hide his plans.
Very definitely possible.
Well, then how can you insist ...
- Because l believe it's factual. l'm convinced
Yamamoto's target is Midway.
But if you're wrong, Admiral, if you send our carriers into a Japanese ambush, the entire West Coast and Hawaii will be open for invasion.
Fully aware of that, Captain.
You mean, the safe play is to defend the home folks first?
With respects, Admiral, it's the smart play.
Captain, if we surprise the enemy, catch him where he's not expecting us, we can drive him back 3,000 miles.
And keep him pinned till we can take him on in his own front yard.
My instructions were to convey Washington's deep concern over the safety of the West Coast and Hawaii. ls Washington ordering me to defend Hawaii or the West Coast?
No, Sir.
My orders were simply to consult.
No, Sir, l have no such orders for you.
Commander Blake, send the fleet to repel invasion. Target: Midway lsland. lssue the order immediately.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Admiral, may l see you a moment?
- Excuse me, Captain.
Damn. You know how
Bill Halsey hates hospitals.
Maybe it's nothing serious.
- To get him anywhere near a hospital it must be not only damn serious, it must be critical.
Admiral, l have some really bad news.
- Today's the day for it.
The Japanese changed the J-N 25 code, the one they used for Yamamoto's plan.
How long do you need for the new code?
- A month, maybe two.
Sir, do you still want that fleet order issued?
Yes. Target: Midway.
Welcome aboard your flagship, Admiral.
Thank you, Captain.
Rear Admiral Kusaka, my Chief of Staff. Captain Aoki.
Where's Commander Genda?
He's in sick bay, Admiral. lnfluenza.
When does the doctor think he can resume his duties? ln 2 or 3 days. l don't like beginning this operation without my best air commander.
We have another sick bay casualty:
Commander Fuchida has appendicitis.
Fuchida too?
We'll need a replacement.
Genda suggests a veteran torpedo pilot:
Lieutenant Tomonaga. lf Genda says so, l want to see Tomonaga right away.
Yes, Sir.
Fuchida, the man who led my first strike on Pearl Harbor, out.
Genda, who planned it, both ill.
Very bad luck, Sir, very bad luck.
Dnly an inconvenience, Sir.
We'll manage.
Good morning, Sir. - Lieutenant.
- Follow me, please.
Here we are. The Sakura family.
Yes. Thank you, Lieutenant. l can find my own way out.
Miss Sakura, l'm Captain Garth, Tom's father.
Please come in.
My parents, Tetsuro and Sada Sakura.
This is Captain Garth.
How do you do?
You want to speak to me in private.
My parents understand.
Yes. Well, thank you. lf l embarrassed you, forgive me, but l wanted you to see that they are not a threat to national security. l never really thought they would be, Miss Sakura. l suppose it goes with the times.
And l shouldn't be bitter? l never said that.
Damn it, l'm an American!
What makes us different from
German-Americans or ltalian-Americans?
Pearl Harbor, l guess.
Look, l've read the FBl report.
Ask me anything you want to.
Alright.
Your father has been seen frequently entering the Japanese consulate.
He has old friends there. l see.
What about these patriotic organizations you belong to?
My father enrolled me in those when l was born.
Dut of respect for him l never resigned, but l wasn't active. l see.
What about those magazines they found in your parents' apartment?
The ''Prairie Shimbun''?
Published in Wyoming.
My father has deep emotional ties for Japan, but even so he thought it was a ridiculous propaganda sheet.
Why did he subscribe?
He's a traditional and honorable man.
He was once indebted to the man who publishes the ''Prairie Shimbun''.
Look, Miss Sakura, l understand you came to Hawaii to ask your parents' permission to marry my son.
Yes, l did.
Why didn't you tell that to the FBl?
- l didn't want to implicate Tom.
Why won't you see him?
He's in love with you, he tells me.
You won't even talk to him.
He doesn't understand. l don't either.
Because my parents have forbidden me to marry outside my race. l want you to tell him for me. l can't tell him that.
He wouldn't believe me.
Besides, l'd just as soon he didn't know we'd talked together.
Look, Miss Sakura,
Haruko,
Tom's based at Kaneohe Naval Air Station.
Send for him, please.
You have to tell him this.
You have to tell him.
Damn itching is driving me crazy!
All those medics can do is smear this God-awful paste on it.
When they get the nerve to come near.
- l know l'm a bad patient.
But a skin disease! Df all the stupid, useless things to get laid up with! lt's driving me nuts. l can't even think! - We don't have much time.
Fletcher's docking the Yorktown now, and l've got hard decisions to make.
Recommend your replacement.
- Ray Spruance. l know he's junior to a lot of other flag officers, and never served a day on a carrier.
But Chet, he knows carrier tactics.
Well, you asked for my recommendation. l can just picture
Washington's reaction if l hand over the Hornet and the Enterprise to a cruiser skipper.
Especially with the static l'm getting for expecting the Japanese at Midway.
You told me once, Chet:
''When you're in command, command.''
Admiral Fletcher, Sir.
- Good morning, Sir.
Welcome home, Jack. Congratulations on bringing your cripple in.
Well, we got lucky. - We haven't got much time, so l'll make this fast.
Halsey's beached, in the hospital.
Won't be leaving for a while. l'm sending you out again, Jack, in 72 hours. ln full combat readiness.
That's impossible! lt'll be 3 months before the Yorktown's in commission.
Spruance has replaced Halsey. He takes
Hornet and Enterprise to sea tomorrow.
You follow him 48 hours later.
Spruance is a cruiser commander!
- He knows carrier tactics.
Yeah, but he can't fly.
- Neither can you.
And he sure as hell can't learn it by tomorrow, can he?
No.
Congratulations, Ray.
- Well, l'm still in a state of shock.
Nice seeing you again, Matt.
How's the hand? - Coming fine, Sir.
We could have used you at Coral Sea.
He's on your Air Dperations staff on the Yorktown.
Good.
We face the biggest force the enemy has ever sortied, over 200 ships.
They've got 4-to-1 supremacy.
Yamamoto himself is commanding.
We know when and from where he's going to sail, we know their original courses.
We don't know their rendezvous point, course changes or when they'll strike.
They could hit from the northwest, but intelligence doesn't support that.
Ray, assuming this isn't just an elaborate ruse,
Washington thinks it is, but assuming they're wrong, what kind of move do you suggest?
Well, l'd take my carriers here, to a point northeast of Midway, and wait for Nagumo's carriers.
Why not head northwest and hit them head-on?
There's a chance
Washington may be right.
You think Hawaii and the West Coast could be the real target? lt doesn't really matter, provided l'm in a position to cut them off. lf it's Midway, l'll bushwhack them.
Alright. Jack, you're senior. You take command when you join up. - Yes, Sir.
The Yorktown will be at sea in less than 72 hours. l don't need to stress that Yamamoto outweighs us in every department.
Dur 3 carriers are all that stands between the enemy fleet and our coast.
Now, your point of rendezvous, what should we call it?
''Point Luck'', Sir.
Sounds like a prayer, but it's damned appropriate.
Son of a bitch!
Nurse!
Ray.
- Hi, Bill.
Wanted to call the nurse to have that tree cut down. lt spoils my view of the boatyard.
Feeling DK? l can't sleep. l can't eat. l just sit and scratch 24 hours a day.
You ever try an oatmeal and water bath? Don't. l want to thank you for recommending me to take your place. l have a question:
Did that itch go to your head?
Stop underestimating yourself.
Any skipper who can keep his cruisers and destroyers alongside my carriers across the whole
Pacific is the man for the job.
You know, you and l ...
Bill, we're kind of different.
You think l can do it as well as you? l can only tell you this, Ray:
You play it the way you feel it, not the way you think l'd play it.
You go to sea, find Yamamoto and chew his ass. Nothing more to it.
Christ, no! You want to catch this?
We'd lose the God-damned war!
Dh, by the way, l'll have somebody cut down that tree for you. - Yeah. ln carrying out the task assigned in Dp-Plan 29/ 42,
Enterprise and Hornet will act on the principle of calculated risk, which means avoiding exposure to attack by superior enemy forces without good prospect of inflicting greater damage to the enemy.
Sir, three boilers are out of commission.
The yard manager says he needs another two days.
Delaney, l expect the yard to finish the job by 06:00 tomorrow.
Sorry about your boiler, Jack.
But if you clear Pearl by 07:00 you'll rendezvous with Enterprise and Hornet on schedule.
Agreed.
- Good luck, good hunting. - Thanks.
You too, Matt. See you back here soon.
We just haven't any future, Tom. l figured that's what it was.
We don't.
We really don't. l wish you'd go now. l don't love you anymore. lt was a mistake.
Say it to my face. say it to my face, God damn it! lt'll be DK.
Shit. Wait and see!
1919, the Marines were practicing dive-bombing off Haiti.
Everybody said:
''Premature, wait and see.''
We waited, then the Germans showed us in '37 in Madrid.
You mean like at Pearl Harbor?
- Pearl Harbor, shit! ln '32 it was proved that Pearl Harbor could be attacked from the air.
And Admiral Ramsey predicted it would happen, in detail.
When was that?
- 1937, pal.
Wait and see. We waited.
December 7th, we saw.
The wait-and-seers will bust your ass every time. l'll drink to that.
- Bet your ...
How long have you been here?
- Long enough to hear your lecture.
You ought to go on the radio.
How the hell are you?
Alright ... Well, l'm celebrating my birthday. That's how l am.
That's a problem we all have once a year.
My God, now you got my kid flying for you.
How's the boy doing?
- Just fine.
He's a good pilot. Got him in an F4F.
He'll be shipping out any day.
Coming from you that means a lot.
No. He's good man, a natural pilot, good attitude, good marksman.
Tom's only deficiency would be in enemy identification.
He's got to learn, you don't win a war by kissing the enemy.
For Christ's sake ... - Well, he told the whole God-damned squadron. l met her. She seems like a nice girl.
- So is Madame Butterfly.
She's having trouble with him.
- Now you're having trouble seeing. l've got to shove off.
Scuttlebutt says you're going out on the Yorktown. - That's right.
Well, keep your dumb ass out of drafts. - That's right, buddy.
Thanks for keeping an eye on my boy. l appreciate it.
He'll be fine, Matt.
Tom! - Nice of you to take the time to see me off, Dad.
But your squadron isn't due to ship for a week. Why are you boarding?
Are you saying you're surprised, Sir?
Your buddy Jessop transferred me. l didn't know anything about it!
- Like hell you didn't!
You wanted me shipped out, to stop me from doing anything stupid!
So your old buddy Jessop obliged.
- Tom, l knew nothing about it! l have to report on board, Sir.
MARlNE lNTELLlGENCE
DK, Sir.
Captain Garth is here, Sir.
- Great. Come in, Matt. How are you? l'm gonna do something l don't do, at least not since Annapolis. l'm gonna ask you to do me a favor.
- Ask away! Lord knows l owe you some.
This is an FBl enemy alien report.
- Where did you get this?
Don't ask.
Matt, l could find out.
- Don't, Harry.
The report contains all the bureau has on ... - A Japanese?
Dn an American citizen named Haruko Sakura und her parents.
They look DK to me, but l'm not in your business. lt sounds like you are.
Harry, l want you to investigate this personally.
They'll be sent to the mainland next week. lf they're clean, and l'm betting they are, l want that shipment cancelled.
Matt, you're way out of line here!
This isn't your department!
This is tampering!
Alright, what have we got?
What are these people to you?
Someday, the girl may be my daughter-in-law.
You're pressuring me to take improper action for personal reasons. lmproper action, hell!
They're no more a threat to national security than your pet Airedale. l'll have to report your request. lt'll go into your record. lt's not for me.
You know l wouldn't ask you for myself. l'm asking you for my kid.
Jesus Christ, Harry! l'm begging you!
Alright, l'll investigate it.
Thanks, Harry.
And, Captain, this'll wash it with us.
We're even.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Captain?
Thank you, Corporal.
Reporting as ordered, Sir.
Sorry to send the Marines after you, but you didn't answer my messages.
We had nothing to talk about, Captain.
You can cut out that midshipman-crap, you're talking to your old man. l'll try to remember it. l'd like to set the record straight:
Before we left Pearl, l personally vouched for Haruko and her parents, and went way out on a limb for them. l didn't know what weight it would carry, but you know, there it is.
Thanks.
Dne more thing: l didn't ask your C.D. to ship you out.
You spoke to him, didn't you?
- Yes, l did.
He asked me how l felt about ...
- Haruko and me, right? lf you couldn't do anything about it, why couldn't you leave it alone?
Jessop thought he was doing us both a favor. l did all l could, and a lot more than l should've.
You're paid to fly fighter planes, not to sit in your cabin and cry over your girl's picture.
You better shape up, Tiger, before a hot-shot Jap pilot flames your ass!
Just received this message, Sir.
Dperation K, the reconnaissance flight to Pearl Harbor, has been cancelled.
Cancelled? Why?
Dur scout planes couldn't refuel.
An enemy vessel was there.
Sir, Admiral Nagumo's carrier force should be warned immediately.
Admiral Nagumo must have picked up the transmission when we did.
Suppose he didn't.
He will assume the American carriers are at Pearl Harbor.
And that is where our latest intelligence reports place them.
What latest intelligence reports?
Have any of our submarines sighted the US fleet in the last 20 hours?
No, Sir. But there's no logical reason for them to move their carriers.
We must not break radio silence and risk letting them know our location.
The element of surprise is one of the most important aspects of our attack.
Admiral, this is our search plan.
An air search involving 22 PBYs, each plane flying 700 miles out, covering an 8-degree sector.
We'll have a 180-degree view at anything coming from the west, and still have a flanking area northeast of Midway for our carriers.
Have it put into operation right away.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Jesus, how many of those can you eat?
Admiral, air reconnaissance report.
No sightings. ls there any defense measure we've overlooked?
That had top priority, Admiral.
You sent everything we had: tanks, PT boats, anti-aircraft guns. lt's miserable waiting for an attack on your own people, hoping it happens.
More pressure from Washington?
- Not a whisper.
Frankly, l'd rather have them raising hell.
Captain.
- What's the count, Reid?
Half a dozen F4Fs and 15 Buffaloes.
Damned relics. - We'll show the Japs we're up here. Maybe we'll get lucky.
DK, Reid. ln less than 5 hours
Hosogaya will attack the Aleutians, and we will still be groping to Midway in this filthy squall.
We're not due to launch our first air strike for 36 hours.
Dur predictions are for clear weather before then, Admiral. l keep wondering what Dperation K uncovered at Pearl Harbor.
Were the American carriers there?
We've heard nothing from Yamamoto.
The American carriers must be there.
Damn communications blackout!
Hey, you guys!
The Japs are bombing Dutch Harbor!
Here we go.
Well, Gentlemen, it's started.
Signal Spruance.
The Aleutian lslands are being invaded, Admiral.
Washington could still be right. lt could be a feint for an attack on the West Coast or here in Hawaii.
Dr what we've defended against.
Today. Dur PBY should tell us today.
Hey, do you see what l see?
Damn right, l do!
Sparks, raise Midway.
Radio: Main body.
That's all? Just ''Main body''?
- Send it! - Yes, Sir.
An American PBY, Sir.
A reconnaissance seaplane!
Radio's picked up it's transmission. lt's alerting Midway.
Break radio silence.
Advise Admiral Yamamoto: lnvasion force has been discovered.
6 large ships in a column, bearing
262 degrees, distance 700 miles.
Admiral.
- You were right, it's Midway.
Enigma!
You know what l mean, Admiral.
- Fletcher's joined Spruance on time.
Another one from Strawberry-9, Sir.
11 ships, course 090, speed 19 knots.
Just what kind of ships?
First transmission said ''Main body'', but didn't mention carriers.
That PBY, Strawberry-9, was at the end of his 700-mile leg.
Nagumo's carriers could be following the large ships.
Maybe beyond his horizon. lf they are, Fletcher's too far north.
He has to move at top speed now to get within striking distance by sunset.
But if Nagumo's carriers are coming in behind the storm front ...
Fletcher'd be caught between two forces.
Yes, if we let him head for that main body sighting.
Send a flash message to Fletcher:
This is not, repeat, NDT main body.
Expect enemy carrier strike tomorrow behind storm front ...
... via northwest, as anticipated.
Signed, Nimitz.
CinCPAC must think the PBY sighted only Kondo's invasion force.
But if it's Nagumo's attack force with its carriers, and its scouts find us before we find them ...
Sound general quarters!
Weather is clearing, Admiral.
We could not have timed it better.
We intercepted a radio transmission from Tokyo to Admiral Yamamoto. lntelligence does not report any movement of the American fleet.
Whatever doubts we may have had ...
- They still are with me, Kusaka.
We have no definitive intelligence reports, only opinions and estimates.
And Yamamoto's silence does not make them a fact.
Admiral.
- Genda.
My apologies. l've been away from my duties much too long.
Genda, how are you? l'm well enough to take charge of air operations.
And so you shall, my friend.
Prepare an air search plan right away.
- For what area?
Where l would deploy my carriers if l were an American commander.
There, northeast of Midway.
Times like this,
Joe, l miss the flatlands. lt's a big body of water out there. l'm a fella from the Texas prairie.
Nearest lake was 120 miles away.
You could wade across it at the height of the rainy season.
During summer we made clay pots out of its bottom.
Whatever happens, Joe, you sure as hell earned your pay this month.
Well, thank you, Sir.
To cover the area, we will launch scout planes from Akagi and Kaga, and our cruiser escorts will launch 5 seaplanes.
Very good. And until our scouts have searched the area, we'll hold our most experienced pilots and half our aircraft in reserve.
But the American fleet can't be anywhere near Midway. We shouldn't hold back our best pilots.
We've been over this before.
Admiral, our first strike must be decisive. lf we don't destroy Midway's airstrip and planes, we invite a counterstrike.
Commander Genda? l agree with you, Sir.
Let our younger pilots fly the first strike. l am sure they can do the job. lf not, we can launch a second strike.
That is how it will be.
Suddenly, the man who led us to victory at Pearl Harbor is choked by caution.
He senses danger out there.
So do l.
Their transports wouldn't be so close if they didn't plan to invade soon.
CinCPAC's right.
They'll hit Midway today.
Yes, but from where?
He could pop out anywhere.
And then his scout planes will be out.
- We have to find him first. lf he hits our blind side ...
Why don't we get some eyes out there?
10 SBDs will cover our northern flank.
DK. But no more than 100 miles out. l want to recover them fast, in case the PBYs make contact first.
You DK?
- Yeah. - Here.
The poor bastards'll miss all the fun.
There's nothing north of us but ocean.
He gets his dope straight from Tokyo Rose. Right, Chili Bean?
Wrong, from here.
When it bristles there's Japs around.
You're crazy!
'Morning, Captain. - You're supposed to be sacked out. What're you doing?
We couldn't sleep. l know, but get below and try.
We got a heavy day ahead.
Yes, Sir.
Excellent weather forecast.
Broken cloud cover up to 2,000 feet to conceal us from enemy scout planes, and above unlimited visibility straight into Midway for our flyers.
Commence launching.
All our cruisers' scout planes are in the air, except one.
The Tone is having catapult problems.
A delay in launching scout 4.
- How long?
Half an hour, Sir. ln case the Americans suddenly appear, l suggest bringing the 2nd flight wave on deck as soon as the 1st is clear.
Armed with torpedoes to deal with enemy carriers? - Yes.
Dur planes and the Kaga's.
Soryu and Hiryu can stand by with bombs for Midway.
Give the order.
- Yes, Sir.
Now it's up to our strike leader.
Tomonaga is the best we've got.
Howie? lt's the whole damn Jap navy!
Radio, raise Midway.
Send: Enemy carriers.
We got 'em! lt's Jap fighter cover.
- Let's duck into the clouds.
''Enemy carriers''? That's all?
That's all Strawberry-5 said.
We haven't heard from him since. lf he was on course and on schedule, he made the contact about here,
250 miles out.
You better signal it to Spruance.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
You certain it was Strawberry-5?
Positive, Skipper.
How far are we from that contact point?
We're 15 minutes behind schedule.
Bandits! Sweet mother of God, hundreds! - Where, damn it?
Four ... no, five o'clock!
Jesus!
Billy, send this quick:
Many planes heading Midway.
Are you certain?
Alright, just let us know the second you get anything else.
Nothing more. No word from our scouts since that ''Many planes'' flash.
Yes, but was that from Strawberry-5?
- No call letters were sent.
Maybe he was jumped by enemy fighters.
Damn it! How many carriers?
What course? What speed?
Those Japs will never find us in this soup.
And we'll never find their carriers unless we break into the clear.
Damn it! l should've risked going straight in.
Nothin'. We've lost 'em!
Lieutenant, they're behind us! l see 2 carriers and a battleship.
Send it!
- Aye-aye, Sir.
''Fletcher to Spruance. Second sighting reported, Strawberry-5:
2 enemy carriers, battleship.
Bearing: Midway, 320 degrees.
Distance: 180 miles.
Course: 135 degrees.
Speed: 25 knots.''
Came right out of the slot where Nimitz figured.
''Proceed southwesterly, attack enemy carriers.
Will follow as soon as search planes recovered. Fletcher.''
Signal ''Ahoy'', Captain Browning.
To battle stations.
Get the control tower.
Andy, Major Parks get his fighters up?
All 23. The SBDs are ready to go.
Get 'em airborne.
- Yes, Sir.
Captain, we've got
Major Parks' frequency.
Rainbow Leader.
Below us, 10 o'clock. l see 'em, Kirk.
Alright, everybody.
Let's see how many we can drop on the first pass.
Two bogies under you!
Got one! Look at that Jap bastard!
Get him off me!
Dn your tail!
Comin' in on you! l'm hit, Rainbow Leader!
My God! Mayday, mayday!
Look out, Rainbow! Dn your tail!
Comin' in on you! Three of 'em!
Look at that Jap bastard!
My God, they got Major Parks!
Look out! Two bogies, four o'clock!
Rainbow Leader, come in!
This is Noah's Ark.
Report please!
What is your condition? Report!
Good God!
Give me the tower.
Andy, they blew right through Parks' fighters!
Get your people under shelter!
Jesus!
Come on!
Attack in squadron order!
God, they creamed us!
- But we're not out of action yet.
Dur landing strip's still operational.
Tomonaga is asking for a second strike.
Sir, this report is a great victory.
We've lost only 7 planes.
We've destroyed 40 enemy aircraft, in the air and on the ground.
But the pilots you chose did not destroy the airstrip.
We have 93 planes and our best pilots waiting on our flight decks.
The entire force should be sent now.
The entire force? Dur planes are armed with torpedoes on Genda's advice.
Hardly suitable for bombing an airstrip. Correct, Commander?
They should be immediately rearmed with bombs below deck.
We must make certain that Midway can mount no air attacks.
Lieutenant Tomonaga's request is also a warning.
Midway is still a threat to us.
So are the American carriers. lf they are nearby, yes.
But after 2 hours, our scouts have reported nothing.
You're forgetting, scout number 4 was a half-hour late taking off. lt will not reach it's maximum search range for another hour.
Tomonaga's planes will be returning soon.
They can be quickly refueled and rearmed for sea action. ln case our scouts sight any enemy ships.
Admiral?
Very well.
Drder our torpedo bombers to be rearmed with contact bombs.
As soon as they are ready, we will launch a 2nd strike on Midway.
57 planes on the line, Sir.
The Hornet will probably launch about the same number.
What's the enemy carriers' position?
- 135 miles, Sir. lf we launch immediately, do our pilots have enough fuel?
Yes, Sir. lf the weather holds, they navigate perfectly and aren't over the target too long. lf we launch now, we might catch Nagumo like a sitting duck. lf we wait, it will give him time to refuel and reload.
Sir, the PBY reported only 2 carriers. l know.
- lntelligence says he has 4. lf those other 2 suddenly pop up ...
- Then we'd be sitting ducks.
But we have 2 certain targets
135 miles away that don't expect it.
Let's get Enterprise and Hornet turned into the wind. lt's from Admiral Spruance.
Enterprise and Hornet are launching every aircraft they've got.
Air controller reports our strike force will be over the deck in 1 hour.
Just the time we need to finish arming our bombers for the 2nd strike.
Your confidence is most reassuring, Kusaka.
Dur scouts report no enemy carriers.
They've started their homeward leg.
All except scout number 4.
10 enemy ships sighted.
Bearing: 010 degrees. Distance: 240 miles from Midway. Speed: 20 knots.
Which scout radioed the contact?
- Number 4, Sir.
How far along are we on rearming?
- Almost half, Sir.
Drder it halted.
Radio scout 4 to ascertain ship types and maintain contact.
Friendlies, Sir.
Dur search planes returning.
They'll be on board in under 15 minutes.
Have Captain Buckmaster see to it.
Dur planes from Enterprise and Hornet should hit the Jap carriers in 1 hour.
They're not on the same course?
We're counting on it, Admiral.
Nagumo has to hold course until he recovers his planes.
240 degrees puts our people on him with unfueled aircraft on his decks. l don't see our fighters, Sir.
They should've caught up to us by now.
And where's Bombing 8?
With Fighting 8.
They took off together.
Ain't they supposed to be with us?
Red Fox Leader to Kit 3.
Red Fox Leader to Kit 3!
Either my compass is fouled up, or we're not heading 240.
There's nothing out there. l know where the Japs are, Mr. Gay.
Will you tell us, Sir? l figure they moved east since we launched, away from Midway.
Roger. - What good's our orders, if the skipper's gonna lead us off? l don't like it.
Take it easy. lf anybody can find the Japs,
Waldron can. He's part Sioux lndian!
Sir, another message from scout 4.
3 additional enemy ships sighted, 250 miles from Midway. Speed: 20 knots.
Apparently 2 cruisers, a carrier believed to be the Yorktown. lmpossible. The Yorktown was virtually destroyed at Coral Sea.
They can't have repaired her and brought her here in 10 days.
We must assume they have! lf it is it, we must destroy her at once. l see.
Suddenly, the threat from Midway's bombers seems less to you than when you urged me to rearm our planes with bombs!
Admiral, Midway must wait.
We should rearm our bombers and attack that carrier.
Back to torpedoes again?
More wasted time! - Tomonaga, this is Genda. Do you read me?
Lieutenant Tomonaga, this is Commander Genda.
Do you read me?
- l read you, Sir. - Report please.
Request permission to land. My pilots report almost empty fuel tanks.
Some have taken anti-aircraft hits.
Urgent we land immediately, Sir.
Do l have permission?
Admiral Yamaguchi advises that we attack the enemy carrier and launch our bombers at once, however they're armed.
While we're launching, Sir, Tomonaga's pilots will crash into the sea!
They're running out of fuel, Admiral.
Alright.
Wait until we've recovered all our airborne aircraft.
While they are landing on the deck, rearm our bomber with torpedoes.
Then we'll attack the enemy carrier.
That's the last of our scouts, Sir.
Tell Eliot to launch all we've got.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Pilots, man your planes!
Admiral, all aircraft now on board.
Tomonaga?
- He was the last to touch down. l want to close range on the enemy carrier. Steer northeast. Full speed!
From Admiral Nagumo:
''Enemy force composed of
1 carrier, 5 cruisers, 5 destroyers, sighted 250 miles from Midway.
We are headed for it.''
Dne carrier?
Close to Midway. Not Pearl Harbor!
Admiral Nagumo will simply destroy it a few days earlier than planned.
Dh, thanks, Matt. l'd give my retirement pay to know what Nagumo's doing.
The same thing we are, Admiral, sweating it out.
Skipper! l see it.
What'd l tell you, Huntington?
The skipper can smell them out.
See if you can raise Bombing 8 and Fighting 8. They must be near.
Better coordinate the attack.
- Yes, Sir.
Red Fox 8 Leader to Badger 8 Leader!
Red Fox 8 Leader to Badger 8 Leader!
Do you read me?
DK, we can't wait all day.
You better get ready, Dobs.
Red Fox Leader to Kits, we're going in!
Divisions 2 and 4, take the carrier.
Divisions 1 and 3, ram the escorts.
And stay together as long as you can. l say again: stay in tight!
Admiral, enemy torpedo bombers off port quarter!
They're coming in without fighter protection.
Mindless suicide!
Perhaps.
But it's an effective technique.
We can't attack their carrier while we're busy dodging them.
They're using up all our fighters.
Bandits, 11 o'clock! Look out!
Two of them. Shoot, shoot!
This is Kit 6, l got 3 of them on my tail. Somebody help me!
Below you, bandits! No, no!
Dh God damn! No!
Stay in formation!
Get in. Close up, you idiots!
They'll jump us to pieces! l'm hit, l'm hit! Dh, Jesus!
Dobs, behind you! Bandits behind you!
Look out!
Huntington, coming in at 10 o'clock!
Huntington!
Huntington, are you dead?
Follow me.
Waldron, get your nose up!
Pull up, pull up!
What happened?
- Dne of our torpedo groups attacked.
Yeah, but which one?
What the hell happened?
Casualty report, Sir:
Dne of our fighters took a minor hit, no shipboard damage, no casualties.
A whole squadron. 15 brave crews.
Torpedo 3 going in at 1,500 feet.
Bombing 3 and Fighting 3 at 1,900.
15 minutes to target.
Who's coordinating the attack?
- Max Leslie. He's leading Bombing 3.
Helen Leader to Helen group:
Time to arm your bombs. l say again: Arm bombs!
God damn it!
Don't touch that damned electric arming switch!
Use manual control!
Too late, Commander. Mine dropped.
- Mine dropped too.
Rotten gadget! Who the hell invented the electric arming switch?
Yamamoto, who else? Now what?
Should we drop spitballs on the Japs?
Alright, knock it off.
The rest, use manual control!
Helen Leader, out.
Skipper, look at Chili Bean over here! l feel them!
Hope he's right.
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader,
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader:
Japs on the horizon! l got 3 ...
Sweet Jesus, l got 4 Jap carriers!
Holy hell, we hit the jackpot!
Yes, sky watch?
- Enemy torpedo planes! - How many?
Two separate groups.
Bertha 3 Leader to Mabel 3 Leader:
How's about it? You boys ready?
Damn right, we're ready!
Let's go, we're running out of fuel!
Roger. Bertha 3 Leader to Small Fry:
Concentrate on the closest flattop.
Push in close and get hits! l count 12 coming in from starboard, Admiral.
14 from port side, Sir!
All these can't be from one carrier.
They must be coming from Midway.
- Dr a second carrier.
We've heard nothing from scout 4 since it sighted the one enemy carrier.
Soryu should send out its scout plane.
We must make certain of what we're up against.
See to it immediately.
- Yes, Sir.
Lining up to jump us, Thach.
About 12 Japs.
We're right above them.
Mabel 3 to Hustlers: Break 'em up!
Score 1 for Commander Thach!
Bogy! Comin' in on you, 3 of 'em!
That a boy, Tom!
Run that bastard into the drink!
Ramos, 2 o'clock!
Nice shootin' !
More comin' in at 1 o'clock!
You got him! Nice goin' !
Mabel 3 Leader to Hustler Tom:
3 bandits at 12 o'clock divin' on you!
Roll out, Tom! Dive, dive!
We've quashed all of their attacks, and not one torpedo has come close.
Sacrifice themselves like samurai, these Americans.
That last attack pulled our entire fighter cover down to sea level.
Now they're looking for survivors.
We have no fighter umbrella over us?
- No, Sir.
We're trying to recall them, get them back up to patrol altitude.
How many fighters are standing by to cover our attack on that carrier?
Barely enough to do the job.
They're American carriers, no doubt about it, Yorktown class.
Get through to Nagumo's flagship. Be quick!
Why are you waiting?
The transmitter isn't working.
We're not sending out any signal!
What's it look like down there?
A Jap destroyer!
Going someplace in one hell of a hurry.
DK, follow it. See where it leads us.
Commander McClusky, look at the fuel gauge. We have to turn back. l know, l know.
The last two attacks were made by over 50 torpedo planes. 50!
There is more than one enemy carrier nearby. There must be!
Admiral. - Genda, why hasn't the Soryu's scout plane reported?
We don't know. lt should have sighted the American ships 10 minutes ago.
Sir, all the bombers are rearmed and ready.
Signal all carriers:
Launch immediately!
There they are, dead ahead.
Sweet mother, look at them!
Huey, the whole Jap navy!
- Pipe down till l report contact!
Raven Leader to Mother Goose:
Have them in sight.
4 enemy carriers. l say again: 4 enemy carriers.
Helen Leader to Mabel and Bertha!
Come in Bertha, come in Mabel!
This is Helen Leader. We have contact.
Come in Bertha, come in Mabel! l'm sorry, Commander Leslie,
Torpedo 3 and Fighting 3 don't answer.
Keep trying. We're supposed to coordinate our attack.
Either their navigation is fouled up or this is the wrong rendezvous point.
Keep trying, damn it!
Mabel Leader, come in!
Raven Leader to flock: They're turning into the wind, preparing to launch. l don't see any Jap fighters, Sir.
Let's not wait for 'em! Fall in! lt's no use. Commander Massey and Commander Thach don't answer.
DK, hang on. We're going in.
Sir, we don't have a bomb! - We can draw some heat off the guys that do.
This is Helen Leader. Concentrate on that big bastard up forward.
Commander McClusky, they've got bombs all over their flight deck!
Bull's eye!
Scratch one flattop! Caught him cold!
Raven Leader to Raven 6. l got a hit, Commander McClusky.
Bring it home, girls, bring it home!
Bull's eye!
Commander, l got a hit!
Look at that bastard burn!
Beautiful, Helen 3, dead center!
We caught 'em flat-footed!
No fighters and a deck full of bombs!
Sweet Mary, how did we get so lucky?
Helen Leader to squadron:
3 enemy carriers burning.
Time to go home.
Admiral, you must transfer your flag.
The cruiser Nagara is close by.
Advise Admiral Yamaguchi. l can't tell you where to find the enemy carriers, Lieutenant Kobayashi.
Their last position was radioed by scout 4 several hours ago.
Hasn't the Soryu scout reported, Sir?
- lt hasn't been heard from.
Then how do l find them, Sir?
- Fly to their last reported position.
Then just trust your luck that somehow you will find them.
Do you hear anything? - Nothing.
All enemy frequencies are silent.
Lieutenant, enemy planes!
- l see them.
Dur fighters are forming for an attack!
Signal them to lay back with us.
- Lay back ... - Stay off the radio!
We'll let them lead us to their carrier. l got all Max Leslie's bombers, Sir.
- Where's the rest of Thach's planes?
Dff the port quarter, Sir. l'll bring the fighters down first.
They'll be the lowest on fuel.
Jesus!
He's alive, Captain.
Flight Mission Combat!
- Go ahead.
Radar has more aircraft, bandits.
020 degrees, 30 miles and approaching.
Roger. Bandits, Sir.
020 degrees, approaching, 30 miles.
Sound general quarters!
We took a bomb hit to the side.
The boilers are out.
Admiral, the radio's down. We can't send visual signals in this smoke.
You better transfer the flag, Sir. l suggest to the Astoria.
Matt, you better stay aboard, help Murray with the flight ops.
Lower the barge.
- Have the Admiral's barge lowered!
This is Zephyr calling Whirlwind:
Enemy carrier on fire! l repeat: Enemy carrier on fire.
Returning to base.
That wasn't Kobayashi. - None of the senior officers survived.
The scout plane from the Soryu is approaching. His radio is out.
He's gonna be DK, Captain.
- We'll transfer him in half an hour.
Hi, Dad. l'll see you back at Pearl, Tom.
There's a picture of Haruko and me that l'd like you to bring ashore. l'll take care of it, Tiger.
Thanks, Dad.
Dnly 1 boiler in use, Sir. 5 are out.
- Can you get 'em on the line again?
Yes, Sir. l think l can guarantee you 15 knots in an hour.
Very good. Delaney, tell your gang the topside fires are under control.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Matt, we have more planes than pilots.
Can you fly one for me?
Sure.
MARlNE lNTELLlGENCE
Did you confirm it?
- Yes, Sir. Fletcher's reply is here.
''Fletcher to Nimitz: Confirm
1st report, 3 enemy carriers afire.''
Hallelujah!
3 of their 1st-line carriers, Admiral! lsn't that worth a ''hot-diggity-damn''?
Good advice, Joe, but there's still that 4th enemy carrier to deal with.
A message from Captain Buckmaster:
The Yorktown's been hit.
Badly? - Yes, but she's underway.
- Dperational?
Dur whole force may be in jeopardy if the Japanese locate the Yorktown.
They still have a tremendous fleet.
But that 4th carrier can't be far off.
We've already won a great victory,
Admiral.
Maybe we should get our people back.
- Break off, run for home?
Before they can hurt us again? Yes.
That may be the smart play.
Trouble is: l want that 4th carrier!
What's wrong?
- Your right wing tank is punctured.
We haven't had time to repair it.
- ls the left tank fueled? - Yes, Sir.
A few hours ago we filled the sky with our planes.
Now we win or lose with 6 fighters and 10 torpedo planes.
The skipper wants to know, can you maintain this speed? - 18 knots.
Very good. - All we gotta do is find that 4th Jap flattop.
Bridge-phone, Combat.
- Go ahead, Combat.
Report from Scouting 5.
Adams located the 4th enemy flattop.
Good. Relay our position to Fletcher.
We found him, Delaney. Just give us all the old lady's got left.
Sir, radar has bandits.
Distance: 35 miles, closing.
They're coming in low.
- Torpedoes! - Sound general quarters!
Let's get everything airborne while we still can.
General quarters!
Man all battle stations!
Right 4 rudder!
- Aye-aye!
Watch out! Get down!
Whirlwind, this is Zephyr 3!
Two torpedoes hit the carrier! l repeat: Two torpedoes hit the carrier! Returning to base.
Now it's one against one, Admiral.
Congratulations.
Delaney, what's the situation below?
No good. All boilers are out.
Get your people topside, fast!
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Larry, radio Enterprise:
We'll land there after our bomb run.
Yes, Sir.
Blue Leader to all planes ...
How many are we sending out?
- 24 dive-bombers.
We'll have to try it without fighter protection.
What about the Hornet?
- Scraping the bottom of the barrel.
16 dive-bombers left, and Matt Garth is bringing 3 from the Yorktown.
Signal the Hornet:
We attack immediately. - Aye-aye, Sir.
That wasn't the carrier
Kobayashi dive-bombed.
She was undamaged.
We put 2 torpedoes into it.
Kobayashi said the carrier was on fire. Did you see any smoke?
No, Sir, it must have sunk.
We didn't see a 3rd carrier, either.
Dive alert! Enemy dive-bombers!
Sir, we must withdraw.
How will we apologize to His Majesty?
Leave that to me. l am the only one who must apologize to His Majesty.
Thank you.
That was the LSD, Sir.
Matt Garth is coming in.
His plane is all shot up. l wonder if Matt knew how big we won. l think l know what he'd have said:
''lt doesn't make any sense, Admiral.
Yamamoto had everything going for him, power, experience, confidence ...
Were we better than the Japanese, or just luckier?''
